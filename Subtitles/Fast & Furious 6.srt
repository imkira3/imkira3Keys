00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,357
<i>Señor</i> O'Conner, <i>señor</i> O'Conner!

3
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,814
It's okay, you're just in time.

4
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,649
You're going to be
a great father, Brian.

5
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:50,236
What makes you so sure?

6
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,408
Because I'll be there to
kick your ass if you ain't.

7
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:54,744
Get in there.
Go.

8
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,034
Brian.

9
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:01,793
Remember, the second
you go through those doors,

10
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:04,341
<i>everything changes.</i>

11
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,298
Our old life is done.

12
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,261
Let's go for a little ride.

13
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,829
Special Agent Hobbs?
Riley Hicks.

14
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,749
I read your file. Top
of your class at FLETC.

15
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,259
Cairo, Tunis.

16
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,545
Youngest RSO ever
in Afghanistan.

17
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,965
Hell, if you're half as good
as you are on paper,

18
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,849
we're going to
get along just fine.

19
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,934
A Russian military
caravan attacked,

20
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,221
satellite component stolen.

21
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,014
Cars just came out of nowhere.

22
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,183
Six hospitalized,
a dozen vehicles destroyed.

23
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,899
All that in under 90 seconds,
in and out.

24
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,024
This is world-class.

25
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,696
Job this good, there's
only one crew in the world

26
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:14,864
who could get this done.

27
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,927
How the hell did
that get up there?

28
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,247
They caught one.

29
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,498
Where?

30
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,796
I got you five minutes
with this guy.

31
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:32,424
I only need two.

32
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,849
I want your boss.
Where's Shaw?

33
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:51,894
I ain't telling you shit.

34
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,358
I was hoping you'd say that.

35
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:01,945
Is that legal?

36
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,075
No.

37
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,749
But are you going to go
in there and tell him?

38
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,753
I've got rights, you asshole!

39
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,714
Not today.

40
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,642
No, no!

41
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,357
Well, is he talking?
Not anymore.

42
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,559
That room is bugged, Hobbs.

43
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,944
So, any information you just beat
out of him, Interpol has now.

44
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,906
Great. Now they can take the morning off.
Shaw's in London.

45
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,160
Let's go pick him up.

46
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,869
Woman, you just don't pick up
Owen Shaw like he's groceries.

47
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,409
If you want to catch
wolves, you need wolves.

48
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,202
Let's go hunting.

49
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:47,726
This is what 100 million buys?

50
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,638
It wasn't that hard
to find you, Toretto.

51
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,275
I wasn't hiding.

52
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,948
How's the life of the retired
international criminal?

53
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,489
I like it here.
It's quiet.

54
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,238
Nice weather,

55
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:09,697
and no extradition.

56
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,372
So what are you
doing here, cop?

57
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,913
Last Tuesday, a team of
highly coordinated drivers

58
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,548
took down an entire
military convoy in Russia.

59
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:20,129
I don't do cold weather.

60
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,297
I know it wasn't you.

61
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,413
But you're going to help me
catch the team responsible.

62
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,048
And you ain't gonna need that.

63
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,927
You can't touch him, Hobbs.
You've got no powers...

64
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,267
I'm not here to
extradite anyone.

65
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,103
See, he's going to
come voluntarily.

66
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,858
As a matter of fact,

67
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,603
he's going to beg me.

68
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,572
This was taken a week ago.

69
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,782
I'll see you out front.

70
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,050
It's Letty, isn't it?

71
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,928
It's impossible.

72
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:21,729
If that was my husband, if there
was a chance, no matter how small,

73
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,482
I would go.

74
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,508
I'm going to need everything,
all the info you got.

75
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,296
You'll get it when
the team gets it.

76
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:49,806
No team.

77
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,763
This is going to
have to be me alone.

78
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,644
It's not that simple.

79
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:57,602
The crew we're after, they hit like
thunder and disappear like smoke.

80
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,313
You go in alone,
you won't ever touch them.

81
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:03,149
I've been chasing this guy across
four continents and 12 countries,

82
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,592
and believe me, the last damn
place I want to be right now

83
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,817
is on your front doorstep,
selling Girl Scout cookies.

84
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,949
I need your help, Dom.

85
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,116
I need your team.

86
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,372
Okay, ladies, bring it in.

87
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,381
Listen, I want to make a toast.

88
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,712
Come on.

89
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,174
Listen, I know a few of y'all
have already been to Macau,

90
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,964
but you have
never seen the town

91
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,219
till you've seen it
through my eyes.

92
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,141
We got a penthouse suite

93
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:35,890
with an ocean view that's
going to change your life.

94
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,771
150-foot yacht with
a helicopter pad...

95
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:42,434
Mmm-hmm. Safe to say, you're about
to have the time of your lives.

96
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,565
No, you are.

97
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,354
Cheers.

98
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:35,369
Nice!

99
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,203
I'm a citizen of the world.

100
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,412
Ever thought about
settling down?

101
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,252
Starting a life together?

102
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,333
Aren't we doing that?

103
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,882
Are we?

104
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,113
Hello?

105
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,411
Dom?

106
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,577
I'll be there.

107
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:27,042
Hey, my man, I need you to
turn this plane around.

108
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,958
All right, listen, ladies. There's
been a little change of plans.

109
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,250
Something came up.

110
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,590
You know that casino
I was telling you all about?

111
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,505
I got some vouchers

112
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:37,015
to the buffet.

113
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,228
What do you think of this?

114
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,857
He likes it.
All right.

115
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:55,404
Yes.

116
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,609
Or this?

117
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:58,745
Yes.

118
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,854
That's my boy. All right, let's
see how this thing flies.

119
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:04,751
Are you watching?

120
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,668
It's Uncle Dom.
What do you know?

121
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:16,004
Are you waving?
What up?

122
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,763
Hey, Jack.

123
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,266
What's up, Uncle Dom?
What's up, Uncle Dom?

124
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,143
You excited to see him?

125
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,020
Are you already
pushing imports on him?

126
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,146
You say, "Dad's not
pushing anything."

127
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,603
He chose that car.

128
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,312
We know he's an O'Conner, but,

129
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:31,611
I brought you something, Jack.

130
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,856
Yeah! He's also a Toretto.
I don't know.

131
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,651
Luckily, he has a couple more
years to decide, right?

132
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,615
I think he decided, Mia.

133
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,827
I think it's time for his nap.

134
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,866
Come on, baby. Okay.

135
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,165
Say bye.

136
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,791
<i>It's weird, huh?</i>

137
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:52,965
What's weird?

138
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,294
We got everything.

139
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,468
You know, down to the beer
and the barbeque.

140
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,883
But it just...

141
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,640
I don't know, it just
doesn't feel like home.

142
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,639
Maybe it's because, uh,

143
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,274
you don't realize how much
you appreciate something

144
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,318
until somebody takes it away.

145
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,271
I don't know.

146
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:16,693
The place has probably
changed so much,

147
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,733
you wouldn't even recognize
it anymore.

148
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,033
Yeah.

149
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:24,364
Everything's changed.

150
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,826
So what's up with you?
What's going on?

151
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,172
Taken a week ago.

152
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,838
Diplomatic Security Service.

153
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:41,677
Hobbs.

154
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:50,519
You know, I used to do this
shit all the time as a cop.

155
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:54,394
This is exactly what cops do.
He's messing with your head.

156
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,243
Letty's dead, Dom.

157
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,500
I need to know for sure.

158
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:11,878
Then I'm going with you.

159
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,379
You said you were going to
leave this life behind.

160
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:15,540
We both said that we were
leaving the life behind.

161
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,542
He's right.

162
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,339
We're family.

163
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:22,510
If we got a problem,
we deal with it together.

164
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,300
And I'll feel safer knowing
you're both out there,

165
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,556
watching each other's backs.

166
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:31,731
You're stronger together.
You always were.

167
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,234
Now go get Letty.

168
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:38,734
<i>Bring her home.</i>

169
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,875
Thank God!

170
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,918
Finally, some equipment
I can work with.

171
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,132
What up, boy?

172
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,052
This is way better
than that trash in Rio.

173
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,263
Way better.

174
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:12,726
You sure about these guys?

175
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,432
Nope.

176
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,026
Has anybody heard
from Leo or Santos?

177
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:21,861
Last time anyone saw them, they were
hitting up the casinos in Monte Carlo.

178
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:24,025
I thought that was
our last job, Brian.

179
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:26,741
And who's paying for all this equipment?
The taxpayers?

180
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,618
So now we work for The Hulk?
That's what we're doing?

181
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,834
Why do I smell baby oil?

182
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,118
If you keep
running your piehole,

183
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:35,642
you're going to
smell an ass-kicking.

184
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:36,750
All right, Hobbs,

185
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,589
you got the best
crew in the world

186
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,007
standing right in front of you.

187
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:43,090
Give them a reason to stay.

188
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:47,015
Our target is Owen Shaw.

189
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:50,351
Former major in the S.A.S.,
Spec-ops soldier.

190
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,184
He ran the UK's Mobility
Division in Kabul and Basra.

191
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:56,020
Ah, damn. That Mobility
unit's the truth.

192
00:16:56,557 --> 00:17:00,312
We're talking vehicular warfare.
Best in the world.

193
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,765
You got some chips? TEJ: Those
guys don't mess around.

194
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,864
For years, they've been
running jobs in Europe,

195
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,182
but it's their most recent jobs

196
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:09,488
that graduated them
to a whole new level.

197
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:12,123
Three targets, highly specific.

198
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,708
The program terminal
from an ICBM missile...

199
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,995
Got a little change?

200
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,754
Seriously?
You're a millionaire,

201
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,711
and you're still
trying to ask for money?

202
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:24,757
That's how you
stay a millionaire.

203
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:26,045
So what does this all mean?

204
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,773
Well, our best guess is
that Shaw's crew

205
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,840
is building
a Nightshade device.

206
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,680
Which is?
A tech bomb.

207
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,345
Designed to block an entire
military communication grid

208
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:35,771
for 24 hours.

209
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,603
If you blind a soldier
for a single second

210
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,309
in the middle of a fight,
he dies.

211
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:42,232
If you blind
a country for 24 hours,

212
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,688
the loss of life
is unthinkable.

213
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:46,733
This could be worth billions
to the right buyer.

214
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:47,863
Billions?

215
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,653
Why don't we just
steal that shit?

216
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:51,783
Hey, man.

217
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,449
Which one of these
things is a dollar?

218
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,204
It says something about...

219
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,164
It's on the house.

220
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,842
I want you to
help me catch Shaw.

221
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,390
He's only got one piece
left that he needs,

222
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:13,392
and I intend to stop him
before he gets it.

223
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,644
Now, I know
you guys are a family.

224
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,310
So I'm offering you
a chance right now

225
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,358
to make that
family whole again.

226
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,526
You want to make
this family whole again?

227
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,614
Get us to Letty,
we'll get you Shaw,

228
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,495
full pardons
all the way around.

229
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,712
I can't promise you that.

230
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,380
Yes, you can.

231
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,129
That's the deal.

232
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,681
Take it or leave it.

233
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,813
You get me Shaw,

234
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,770
and I'll get your pardons.

235
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:05,778
You heard him.

236
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,483
But this is different.

237
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,864
We're not dealing with cops,

238
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,339
we're not dealing
with drug dealers.

239
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,490
This is a whole
different level.

240
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,541
We're getting paid, right?

241
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,705
Interpol picked up one
of Shaw's guys in Moscow.

242
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,592
I went in, had a little
therapy session with him.

243
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,969
He gave up Shaw's hideout.

244
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,896
Then why aren't we
down there now?

245
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,852
Well, we weren't invited.

246
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,029
Hobbs, they're sending in
your punching bag.

247
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:52,033
He's wired. He's going to give a
positive ID on Shaw before they move in.

248
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:08,207
So, the cops just
let you go, huh?

249
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,886
Don't worry,
I didn't give them shit.

250
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:15,131
Oh, I'm not worried.

251
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,133
Okay.

252
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,434
Turn it over for me.

253
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,778
God, it's amazing.

254
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:34,367
The simplest things can
cause the biggest problems.

255
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,988
Good news is,
if you swap out a bad part,

256
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:43,414
everything runs
smooth as silk again.

257
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,375
Look, Shaw...

258
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,377
Wait, Shaw! Shaw!

259
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,126
<i>Shaw!</i>

260
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:53,636
I just got confirmation on Shaw.
They're going in.

261
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,400
Wait, wait, hold up...

262
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:16,444
Police scanners are saying alarms are
going off at Interpol headquarters.

263
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,572
Shit.

264
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,911
He brought us here so he
could take down Interpol.

265
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,405
This whole thing's a set-up.

266
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:23,540
Brian, take the team.
What about you?

267
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:25,869
Hobbs and I will wait for Shaw.

268
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:27,787
Shaw leads to Letty.

269
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,046
Come on, you son of a bitch.

270
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,387
What's this?

271
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,431
It's your share
from the last job.

272
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:51,686
<i>You're part of the team, Oakes.</i>

273
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,854
<i>You do your job, you get paid.</i>

274
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:57,283
There's a little
extra in there for you.

275
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:00,407
Consider it an advance.

276
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:01,786
For what?

277
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:04,995
The next job, of course.

278
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,083
Which job?

279
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,000
The one we're
working right now.

280
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,714
Han, how far
are we from Interpol?

281
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,002
Twelve blocks away.

282
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,649
You guys,
it's a ghost town over here.

283
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,394
<i>Shaw must have pulled
all the cops to him.</i>

284
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:23,426
All right, y'all, we're in
this shit, so let's go get it.

285
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,577
It's been fun
running with you, mate.

286
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:35,897
Stop! Drop the bag!

287
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,442
There he is.
On it.

288
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,901
Toretto, it's on you. Straight
ahead, don't lose him.

289
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:28,999
Ain't gonna happen.

290
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,646
Sorry about that, boys.

291
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:48,154
Interpol, straight ahead.

292
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:55,814
Let's go, guys.
We've got company.

293
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:14,601
Let's go, boys.

294
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,395
Get in! Let's go!

295
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,283
Hey! We got to move. Now!

296
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:40,755
Shaw, we have three cars tailing us.
<i>You know what to do.</i>

297
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:53,765
Guys, I got the Rover.

298
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:55,600
Okay, I got...

299
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:59,225
Whatever the hell
that thing is.

300
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:13,525
What is that, a hockey puck?

301
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:46,313
Oh, shit!

302
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:17,345
Approaching rendezvous point.

303
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,518
Dom! Tej and Roman
are out! Where you at?

304
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:25,732
I'm right behind you!

305
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:47,841
Stay on track. I'm
taking the contingency.

306
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:53,513
Boys, I got eyes on Shaw.
He just made a left.

307
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,766
- I got right.
<i>- Toretto, make that left!</i>

308
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:06,856
No problem.

309
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:19,345
Letty.

310
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:38,035
Take the wheel.

311
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:12,148
Letty.

312
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,707
<i>This is crazy.</i>

313
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,414
We are not in Brazil.

314
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,005
So, now we got cars
flying in the air?

315
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:39,263
On some 007-type shit?
This is not what we do!

316
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,765
Man, you really got
to check that emotion.

317
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:44,722
Your voice just went from
Shaggy to Scooby-Doo.

318
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:46,605
"This is not what we..."

319
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:49,936
See, man, when a woman
starts shooting at you,

320
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,897
that's a clear sign
to back the fuck off!

321
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:56,525
We need to get
the hell out of Dodge!

322
00:30:57,647 --> 00:31:00,400
That could have been
my forehead, man.

323
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:01,614
No.

324
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,912
That's not as big
as your forehead.

325
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:11,919
Mia...

326
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:15,757
Uh, It's definitely Letty.

327
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:18,044
But it's, uh..
It's complicated.

328
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,928
Letty's alive.

329
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:21,930
That's all that matters.

330
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:24,683
<i>We have her back, Brian.</i>

331
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:31,353
<i>Well, do me a favor and give
Jack a kiss goodnight for me.</i>

332
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:33,768
Be safe.
I love you, Mia.

333
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:49,825
She definitely saw it was you?

334
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,665
She looked dead at me, Brian.

335
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,498
Maybe the Letty we once
knew is gone, Dom.

336
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:01,094
Even though she's alive,
maybe she's gone.

337
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:04,803
You don't turn
your back on family.

338
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:09,262
Even when they do.

339
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:30,449
Ivory.
Yo.

340
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,997
It's going to
need some repairs.

341
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,958
No problem, treacle.

342
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,039
Are you good?

343
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:38,916
Yeah.

344
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:42,135
Okay, listen up.

345
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:46,090
That was a very different breed

346
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:48,175
from Hobbs' usual
wannabe warriors.

347
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,969
We need to learn who these people
are, what they're made of.

348
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:52,183
Vegh?

349
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:57,688
O'Conner, Parker,

350
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,234
Pearce, Toretto

351
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,615
and the rest of the team.

352
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:06,151
These guys are
common criminals.

353
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:08,320
Tonight these common
criminals were seconds away

354
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:09,780
from taking us down.

355
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:13,120
Show them the respect they
deserve, or it weakens us.

356
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:15,619
You might want to see this.

357
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:23,965
Ring any bells?

358
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:32,977
Yeah.

359
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,648
That's the guy I shot.

360
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:37,770
You look happy.

361
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,271
I don't remember him.

362
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,686
That's bullshit.

363
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,566
We got a problem, guys.

364
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:45,448
We got a picture of her with the
guy who almost took you out.

365
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:47,325
Klaus, aren't you team muscle?

366
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:51,238
Don't make me go over there
and make you team pussy.

367
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:55,409
She doesn't remember him.

368
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:58,203
Names and records
aren't enough.

369
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:02,671
I want personal information. Get
into their lives, into their minds.

370
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:05,676
Find their weaknesses,
and we will exploit them.

371
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,427
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, right.

372
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:16,354
This is crazy, man.

373
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:18,015
What are you talking about now?

374
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,809
I'm sitting here
looking at these images...

375
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:23,525
It's like we're hunting
our evil twins.

376
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:26,277
Look at this black dude
right here, he's handsome.

377
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:27,775
Clearly, that's me.

378
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:31,782
We got a white Hobbs.
This is Han.

379
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:35,411
Tej, it's an African
in a beanie.

380
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,702
That's like
your Mini-Me, man.

381
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,166
And Brian!

382
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,628
When did you do
this photo shoot?

383
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:45,341
I'm just playing, man.

384
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:47,882
You know you're the prettiest
blonde around here.

385
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,020
All right, lock it up.
We got two things.

386
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:01,233
First off, this is the worst damn
city in the world to commit a crime.

387
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:03,064
They got cameras on
every street corner.

388
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:05,570
I got video footage
from CCTV of the raid.

389
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:06,817
Let's track that,
see where it leads us.

390
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,735
And secondly,
we just got confirmation

391
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,455
on what Shaw's crew
grabbed from Interpol.

392
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:11,646
They ripped off the database

393
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,620
of every location that houses the
final component that they need.

394
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:15,785
So where are they at?

395
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:17,705
There are over two dozen
of them around Europe.

396
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,910
But the list is
only good for 96 hours.

397
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,044
Which means, wherever Shaw's
crew is going to hit next,

398
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,046
it's going to happen
within the next four days.

399
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,502
They got a window,
and so do we.

400
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,383
- We gotta move.
- Hobbs is right.

401
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:28,881
So let's break this down.

402
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,120
You met them.
What do we know?

403
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,339
We know they have to be
running custom engines.

404
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,098
You heard that flip car
going through those gears.

405
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:35,474
Sequential transmission.

406
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,070
That didn't sound
like a normal engine.

407
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:38,770
That was a turbo diesel.

408
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,142
It sounded like something
you hear at Le Mans.

409
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:41,352
Did you see it
take all those hits

410
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:42,603
and still stay flat
in the corners?

411
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:43,854
Yeah, hydraulics.

412
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,105
Or magnetic suspension.

413
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:47,446
Who not only has
access to the components,

414
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,000
but can fabricate
something like that?

415
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:50,774
Maybe a handful
of shops in London.

416
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,659
Regular tuner shops aren't
going to cut it on this one.

417
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,661
We're going to have to
dig deeper than that.

418
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,156
Han, Gisele, Roman, you're up.

419
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,205
We find the guy
who made that car,

420
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,752
we find Shaw.

421
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,459
Let's go.

422
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:07,632
I'll help.
Roger that.

423
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:11,591
Tej, we're gonna need cars without
computer chips that can be overridden.

424
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,673
Make sure they're fast.

425
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,011
I got this.

426
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:18,810
I'm already on it, Dom.
I've contacted R&D at DSS.

427
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,436
Hobbs...

428
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,347
I said I got this.

429
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,814
This should be interesting.

430
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,704
Man, you really
got to loosen up.

431
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:44,619
You can't just throw a bunch of factory-line
Beemers at people and expect...

432
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:46,413
Hey. That car is
a hell of a car.

433
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,297
You're talking about
twin-turbo V8,

434
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,421
spitting out 560 ponies, son.

435
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:53,302
He reads the brochure.
I'm proud.

436
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,384
But with cars,
you have to customize.

437
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,390
It's all between you
and the car you build.

438
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,138
It's a bond, it's a commitment.

439
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,973
It sounds like a marriage.

440
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:02,888
Yeah, but with cars,
when you trade up,

441
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:05,269
they don't take half your shit.

442
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,105
Jesus.

443
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:10,828
With price tags like this, these
cars better be made out of gold.

444
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:16,906
You ain't thinking about stealing
these cars, are you, Parker?

445
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:19,826
Kitchen help entrance
is towards the back.

446
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:21,956
Come again?

447
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,248
I don't mean any offense,
gentlemen,

448
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:26,161
but you couldn't possibly afford
the cars in this auction.

449
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:30,503
Substantial lack of gaudy
jewelry, no entourage, no honeys.

450
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,713
Clearly you're
not a "baller."

451
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,006
And you.

452
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:37,096
Hmm. Shoes, shirt, trousers.

453
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:38,636
Functional.

454
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:40,763
And your posture,
too rigid, no swagger.

455
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:43,387
My guess is military.
Take home of 50,000 a year.

456
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:45,264
That's U.S.

457
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,682
Which is not enough
to be playing here.

458
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:48,691
So, if you're not kitchen help,

459
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:50,815
then you must be
in the wrong place.

460
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:55,069
But please,
do finish your champagne.

461
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:00,244
Oh, he needs to be
taught a lesson.

462
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:03,410
Like I said,
you ain't stealing these cars.

463
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,992
I got this.

464
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:13,925
All right, this is
number five on our list.

465
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,343
Holy shit.

466
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,843
What's the dude plan on hunting?
Moby Dick?

467
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,636
That must be our guy.

468
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:26,931
So, how do you all
want to play this?

469
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,978
Han and I got this.

470
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,565
We go in tight, you let
me do all the talking,

471
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,024
and you all have my back on it.

472
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:36,485
There's one thing
you boys are forgetting.

473
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,158
He's a man.

474
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:40,736
Let's go.

475
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:43,530
"He's a man"?

476
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:47,371
You know, she always says that.

477
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:57,878
What you're looking at is a
5.45 by 18 FMJ spitzer bullet.

478
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:01,014
It's specific to
one handgun, the PSM.

479
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,925
Given that handguns are illegal
in the United Kingdom,

480
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:06,686
there's very few people that
have access to that firearm.

481
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,392
So if somebody wanted to, say,

482
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,565
track down where it came from,

483
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,896
it wouldn't be too hard.

484
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,932
I was a cop for a lot of years.
Some habits die hard.

485
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:18,899
A pawn shop.

486
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,284
Who sent you?

487
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:32,788
Come on, ladies!

488
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:36,382
Two hot girls like you don't
wander into this neighborhood

489
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,300
unless I've called
the escort service.

490
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,341
And I haven't, yet, today.

491
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:45,596
I don't know, man.
That was disrespectful.

492
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,393
And I don't like
the way she said it,

493
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,345
like, "He's a man."

494
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,353
"He's a man"?
So, what are we?

495
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:55,018
Come on, she's just
doing her job.

496
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,938
"Doing her job."

497
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,690
I see what's going on.

498
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:02,734
See what?

499
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:05,996
You got the little
stardust in your eyes, eh?

500
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,489
Little birds floating
around a little bit.

501
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:15,500
Uh, you don't want to lease this model.
You want to buy.

502
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:16,835
Can you please stop talking?

503
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:20,969
No, no, you're in love!
Look at you!

504
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:22,421
Just stop.

505
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:25,093
You got special plans?
Big day?

506
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:26,494
You're going to
invite us all out?

507
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,601
Better make sure you
get her a big rock, man,

508
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:31,076
'cause she doesn't look like
she'll be that easily impressed.

509
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:32,977
And if it's not a big rock,

510
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:34,148
you better be big
somewhere else.

511
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:36,560
You know what
I'm talking about.

512
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:40,150
That's why all your girlfriends
wear so much bling, huh?

513
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:43,974
We're looking for information.

514
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,076
You're looking for information?
About what?

515
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:49,239
Information about cars.

516
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:52,375
In particular,
two you designed recently.

517
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:55,412
Ramp cars.
Low slung, skeletal frames.

518
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:58,832
We'd be very interested to
find the man who bought those.

519
00:40:58,915 --> 00:40:59,962
Why should I help you?

520
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,384
Because we're
asking you nicely.

521
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,881
Because you're
asking me nicely?

522
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:05,797
What can you offer that I can't
get from a thousand other girls?

523
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,882
Hmm?

524
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:12,099
Stop! Stop!

525
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:22,067
You look like a man
who likes it rough.

526
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:26,986
My friend here can
give you heights of pain

527
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,904
you've never
experienced before.

528
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:32,953
Do we have a deal?

529
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:36,453
Deal! Deal! Deal!

530
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:37,745
I take it back.

531
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:40,840
Me likey.

532
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:55,809
Stop, stop, stop.

533
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:58,521
So this is how you "got this"?
By buying all of his cars?

534
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:00,685
What good is having millions
of dollars in the bank

535
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:02,195
if you don't spend any of it?

536
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,189
But don't worry about that.
Watch this.

537
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:08,318
Mr. Parker, again, can I
just express our gratitude

538
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:10,828
and say how much
we appreciate your business.

539
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:13,615
If there's ever anything else
you need, you just have to ask.

540
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:14,790
Anything?
Mmm-hmm.

541
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:17,540
Now that you mention it,
my swagger-less friend here,

542
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:20,330
he really likes
that shirt you have on.

543
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:22,465
Uh, this shirt?

544
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:23,882
That shirt.

545
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:26,886
I'm not entirely sure that this shirt
would fit your friend.

546
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,053
It will fit.

547
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:29,802
He needs a shirt
that's a little less...

548
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:30,973
Functional.

549
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:32,722
That's it, functional.

550
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:37,354
Okay.

551
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:43,895
I'll hold that.
Thank you.

552
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:45,692
Come on, man, time is money.

553
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:46,981
Yes, doing my best.

554
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:52,867
Damn, you need some hedge
clippers for that shit.

555
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:56,411
Well, if that will be all...

556
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:58,580
And the pants, too.

557
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:06,925
Right.

558
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,887
While you're at it,
let me get that watch.

559
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:11,263
I like that watch.

560
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:22,859
This is for you.

561
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,940
And this is for you.
Thank you.

562
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,939
Good day, gentlemen.
Thank you.

563
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,205
So I, um,

564
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,533
I got the information in here.

565
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:53,465
May I ask why
you're looking for Shaw?

566
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,300
He took something of ours.

567
00:43:57,218 --> 00:43:58,970
<i>We'd like to talk
to him about it.</i>

568
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:01,231
<i>Let's see what we've got.</i>

569
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:16,992
All right.
What do you want?

570
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:19,408
They say if someone's
looking for a Russian gun,

571
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:20,666
you're the man to see.

572
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:23,161
Oh, they do, do they?

573
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:28,667
What do you want, mate?

574
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:38,305
That might be a bad idea.

575
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:45,604
I'm looking for the owner of this.
I don't know.

576
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:49,983
Take a closer look.

577
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:52,194
About a week ago,
a girl came in,

578
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:53,673
bought guns, ammo,
everything I had.

579
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,489
A girl?

580
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:56,903
What did she look like?

581
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:58,412
Tough chick, dark hair.

582
00:44:58,988 --> 00:45:00,080
Mean streak.

583
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,492
Word is she's a street racer.

584
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:03,664
Where can we find her?

585
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:05,411
How do I know?
Do I look like a racer?

586
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:10,466
No. You don't.

587
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:18,971
Take care, guys.

588
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:27,524
Oh, shit.

589
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:44,291
Sorry, girls.

590
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:50,957
Let's go!

591
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:41,306
Hold on.

592
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:44,226
Stay with me. Stay with me.

593
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:45,728
Tell me where to find Shaw,

594
00:46:45,845 --> 00:46:47,847
and I'll make him pay for this.

595
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:56,614
Braga...

596
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:30,564
Ow!

597
00:47:48,324 --> 00:47:49,792
Hey, you!

598
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:50,997
Stop right there!

599
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:20,375
You go!
No, you go!

600
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:46,760
No one needs to
know about this.

601
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:48,755
No one.

602
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:05,146
We lost Ivory.

603
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,905
He's gone.

604
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:08,612
Thanks.

605
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:14,913
That's it?

606
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:18,291
If ivory's dead,
he made a mistake.

607
00:51:20,286 --> 00:51:22,084
If you make a mistake,
you pay the price.

608
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:27,798
That's a great eulogy, Shaw.

609
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:30,676
Are you going to
give the same speech

610
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,597
for the rest of us
when we go out?

611
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:54,445
You're the last one I'd have
pegged to be sentimental.

612
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,667
I like you, Letty.

613
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:05,297
I dare say I even feel a
certain warmth towards you.

614
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:06,903
When I found you
in the hospital,

615
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:09,380
and you couldn't
remember anything,

616
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:11,674
I said to myself,

617
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,887
"This girl has a gift."

618
00:52:17,009 --> 00:52:19,307
"She's a blank page."

619
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:24,062
And that made me feel somewhat
protective toward you.

620
00:52:25,351 --> 00:52:28,480
If something happened
to you, for instance,

621
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:31,900
I think I might find that
slightly harder to bear.

622
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,820
What I'm saying is,

623
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:40,533
I would hate to see you

624
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:42,918
make a mistake.

625
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,010
I'm going to get some air.

626
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:21,907
What the hell happened?
We met Dom's girlfriend.

627
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:24,372
She's lovely.

628
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:26,412
Are you all right?
Yeah.

629
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:28,876
Tej, what have you got?
Footage, CCTV? Talk to me.

630
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,541
I just went through all of it.

631
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:33,461
Believe it or not, everywhere Shaw's
team is, the cameras are down.

632
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:35,550
That's a hell of a coincidence.

633
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:39,429
All right, we're going to pay
CCTV a little visit. Let's roll.

634
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,222
What is that?

635
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:43,763
That is a new toy for you.

636
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:45,101
So, what happened?

637
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:47,892
Shaw's goons showed up and
started shooting up the place.

638
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:49,401
But we got something big.

639
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,982
What?
Braga.

640
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:54,319
He's working with Shaw.

641
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:56,991
What are you talking about?

642
00:53:57,151 --> 00:53:59,904
It's true. That phone's filled
with coded payment transactions

643
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,913
that lead straight
to Braga's cartel.

644
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:03,574
Who the hell is Braga?

645
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:06,585
He ran one of the biggest
cartels in Mexico.

646
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:08,121
And my old boss.

647
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:10,585
We used codes just like that

648
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:11,756
to move money
out of the country.

649
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,007
It all makes sense.

650
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,761
Braga was running Letty,
now he's working with Shaw.

651
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,216
It would explain how
the two of them met.

652
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:18,513
Okay, so you all know
all this information

653
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:19,932
about him,
where do we find him?

654
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:21,930
He's sitting in
a prison in Los Angeles.

655
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:23,352
How do you know that?

656
00:54:25,471 --> 00:54:27,473
Brian put him there.

657
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:29,437
All right, so this is
the break we were looking for.

658
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,853
If the two of them
were working together,

659
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,437
Braga will know
what Shaw's up to.

660
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:34,897
I'm going to pay him a visit.

661
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,607
Are you serious right now?

662
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:39,155
Think about what you're saying.

663
00:54:39,443 --> 00:54:40,945
You're wanted, Brian.

664
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:44,949
The moment you step foot off
that plane, it's a wrap.

665
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:46,621
You're not coming back.

666
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:49,128
"Coming back"? How are you
going to get in the country?

667
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:51,163
Let me worry about that.

668
00:54:58,796 --> 00:55:00,469
This is on me.

669
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:03,976
I'm the one that
served her up to Braga.

670
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:07,806
I'm the one that
gets to make it right.

671
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:12,233
Let me make it right.

672
00:55:14,353 --> 00:55:15,650
Be careful.

673
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:24,990
He's ready to see you now.
Right this way.

674
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:30,831
Thank you for seeing us. I won't
take up much of your time.

675
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,587
My men were
attacked earlier today.

676
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:34,168
I'm going to need
to see all cameras

677
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:36,671
in and around Waterloo station.

678
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:39,382
Will somebody
tell Captain America here

679
00:55:39,503 --> 00:55:41,346
that requires clearance?

680
00:55:45,551 --> 00:55:46,848
Terry.

681
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:51,189
Bring up cameras 58
through 62, earlier today.

682
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:56,396
They've been down for
maintenance all morning.

683
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:58,196
Sorry.

684
00:55:58,522 --> 00:56:01,617
Okay. Well, we appreciate
your help. Thank you.

685
00:56:06,238 --> 00:56:08,161
You know what I find
very interesting

686
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:11,122
is Interpol was attacked
recently as well.

687
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:13,504
Those cameras were down, too.
Didn't catch a thing.

688
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:15,122
Nothing.

689
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:17,208
Now, that means
either one of two things.

690
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:18,759
Either means that your
maintenance schedule here

691
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:20,970
aligns perfectly
with their escape route

692
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:23,638
or it means that someone
here is working with them.

693
00:56:24,006 --> 00:56:26,600
And that's just ridiculous.

694
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:27,725
Because there ain't
no way in hell

695
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:30,179
anybody here would be
working for them.

696
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:31,831
Particularly you,
ain't that right?

697
00:56:32,014 --> 00:56:34,016
No, no, that's ridiculous.

698
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:35,650
That is ridiculous.

699
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:38,608
I'm going to need direct
access to your live feed

700
00:56:38,687 --> 00:56:39,734
citywide.

701
00:56:39,855 --> 00:56:43,155
And I also strongly suggest
that you put a hold on any more

702
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:44,489
"maintenance."

703
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:46,494
Yeah, of course.

704
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:48,993
We appreciate your help.
Thank you so much.

705
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:10,018
Well, well, well.

706
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:12,350
The orange in that
really makes your eyes pop.

707
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:21,071
Thanks, fellas.

708
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:22,856
Tell me something, O'Conner,

709
00:57:23,023 --> 00:57:24,866
how is it you keep
running around the world,

710
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:26,182
breaking every law
known to man,

711
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:28,912
and yet here I am, putting
my job on the line for you?

712
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:32,036
You'll feel a lot better once you get
the credit for taking down Shaw.

713
00:57:32,908 --> 00:57:34,910
Oh, I'm tempted
to settle for you.

714
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:37,583
Well, you know what
they say, Stasiak,

715
00:57:37,746 --> 00:57:39,347
if you want the
career-changing big fish,

716
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:41,046
you got to be willing
to put on the big boy panties

717
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:43,218
and sail out to the deep water.

718
00:57:43,377 --> 00:57:44,879
You're an asshole,
you know that?

719
00:57:49,758 --> 00:57:52,557
I missed you, too, man.
I really missed you.

720
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:57,141
<i>I got you admitted into
Victorville to do whatever you got to do.</i>

721
00:57:57,224 --> 00:57:58,771
<i>It's a 24-hour hold.</i>

722
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:00,607
<i>You need to be out
of there by 9:00 a.m.</i>

723
00:58:00,769 --> 00:58:04,114
<i>That's when Forensics will run your
fingerprints through the national database.</i>

724
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:06,070
<i>That program will match you</i>

725
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:07,951
<i>and when they find out
who you really are,</i>

726
00:58:08,068 --> 00:58:09,741
<i>I won't be able to
get you back out.</i>

727
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:11,951
<i>We're taking life in prison.</i>

728
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:20,751
Cute kid.

729
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:29,257
So, I found out Braga's being
held in cell block D3.

730
00:58:29,423 --> 00:58:30,470
That's solitary.

731
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:33,101
I only had enough juice
to get you in Gen Pop.

732
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:36,768
So you're going to have to do
something to get his attention.

733
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:38,765
Sorry about this, man.

734
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:39,941
Sorry about what?

735
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:52,488
Again?

736
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:03,131
Big Brother's about to go live.

737
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:10,673
Damn, you can't flick a booger in
London without somebody noticing.

738
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:17,142
Hey! Don't touch that. That's
nothing to play with, man.

739
00:59:17,304 --> 00:59:18,351
What's the problem?

740
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:20,520
That's high-tensile
titanium cable.

741
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:22,066
What does that mean?

742
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:24,144
That's what they use to anchor
buildings and hold up bridges,

743
00:59:24,311 --> 00:59:26,313
stuff you know nothing about!

744
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,983
See, now, their version,
it works cool,

745
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:32,198
but mine, masterpiece.

746
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:35,204
See, I reversed the gears,
torqued the motor

747
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:37,532
and added this tank
to the back.

748
00:59:38,158 --> 00:59:39,375
That makes it even sweeter.

749
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:40,581
It does.

750
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:41,877
It's not dummy-proof.

751
00:59:42,037 --> 00:59:44,165
Man, I've been known
to handle big guns. Relax.

752
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:46,498
You've been known to
handle that big-ass head.

753
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:49,257
Dom, I did some checking,
asked around,

754
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,296
got the location of
a street race tonight.

755
00:59:52,631 --> 00:59:55,180
Four speed Camaro SS big block.

756
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:57,348
You like it?

757
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:59,012
Nice color.

758
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:50,230
Brian O'Conner.

759
01:00:50,397 --> 01:00:52,525
That was quite an entrance.

760
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:00,745
You put a lot of
these men in here.

761
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:04,043
What? You didn't think
one would recognize you?

762
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:09,590
I've kept tabs
on you, you know.

763
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:12,552
You've been having
a lot of fun out there.

764
01:01:12,711 --> 01:01:16,386
Good cop gone bad,
Rio de Janeiro.

765
01:01:16,548 --> 01:01:18,892
It's exciting when you
go criminal, isn't it?

766
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:22,099
Too bad you didn't do it earlier,
you could have worked for me.

767
01:01:22,262 --> 01:01:23,889
Like Letty Ortiz?

768
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:28,101
So tell me something,
because I buried her.

769
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:29,895
Yeah? You did?

770
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:32,735
You buried something, I couldn't
tell you who or what it was.

771
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:36,238
I know she's
running with Owen Shaw.

772
01:01:37,569 --> 01:01:39,571
Still playing cop, huh?

773
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:42,828
Trust me, this is way
above your pay grade.

774
01:01:44,743 --> 01:01:45,960
Humor me, please.

775
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:50,582
Well, you're a dead man
walking, what does it matter?

776
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:53,926
I ran everything for Shaw.

777
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:57,589
Drugs, guns, money, women.

778
01:01:57,756 --> 01:02:00,600
He taught me to think global
when I was just local.

779
01:02:00,759 --> 01:02:02,261
He made me a wealthy man.

780
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:04,475
And this guy didn't just have
the cartels working for him.

781
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:09,269
He had the CIA, DEA,
everyone in his pocket.

782
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:11,607
He knew what was going to
happen before they did.

783
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:16,276
In fact, he even knew when some
wet-behind-the-ears FBI agent

784
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:19,490
<i>decided to put some
informant in my cartel.</i>

785
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:35,335
The minute you put Letty
undercover, she was dead, bro.

786
01:03:13,999 --> 01:03:15,501
But she survived.

787
01:03:15,834 --> 01:03:17,507
That girl is one tough bitch.

788
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:20,342
Shaw found her
in a hospital two days later.

789
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:22,724
He went to finish the job.

790
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:24,884
And he didn't
kill her. Why?

791
01:03:25,677 --> 01:03:27,679
She had no memory.

792
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,356
Perfect girl, huh?

793
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:34,478
You're lucky this
door's between us.

794
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:43,161
What happened to Letty
is on your head.

795
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:30,333
Look at me! Look at me.

796
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:33,499
You won't do it.

797
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:36,748
What is Shaw up to?

798
01:04:36,915 --> 01:04:39,839
How do you think he knows your
next move before you make it?

799
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:41,594
He's got eyes on you.

800
01:04:41,753 --> 01:04:43,346
Think about it.

801
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,973
The only way you
get close to Shaw

802
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:51,683
is if he wants you there.

803
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:37,911
You've got some
serious balls, man.

804
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:39,621
I've been told.

805
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:42,503
You know, you're lucky
I missed my shot.

806
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:44,668
I think you hit your mark.

807
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:46,086
Really?

808
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:48,087
What is it with you?

809
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:50,097
Do you got
a death wish or something?

810
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:51,929
If that's what it takes.

811
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:53,968
I just want to race.

812
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:56,813
You might lose your car.

813
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,352
Let's do it.

814
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:04,612
Your funeral.

815
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:07,444
Ride or die, remember?

816
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:17,287
Listen up!

817
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:20,495
Out here, we're used
to getting what we want.

818
01:07:20,662 --> 01:07:23,006
This is London, baby.

819
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:24,875
But remember,

820
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:28,048
don't bite the bait.

821
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:29,838
Are you ready?

822
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:32,344
Ready?
Ready.

823
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:37,353
Steady.

824
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:42,021
Go!

825
01:08:33,693 --> 01:08:35,036
Just like old times.

826
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:24,243
This guy is crazy.

827
01:10:03,991 --> 01:10:05,334
You got to be kidding me.

828
01:10:35,982 --> 01:10:37,484
You're still upshifting early.

829
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:40,073
I do that so you brake.

830
01:10:40,987 --> 01:10:44,082
You lose traction
and the back end kicks out.

831
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,992
I noticed.

832
01:10:47,577 --> 01:10:51,502
Look, just because you know how I
ride, doesn't mean you know me.

833
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:54,425
You know what they say
where we're from?

834
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:58,175
Show me how you drive,
I'll show you who you are.

835
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:05,178
You never could resist
American muscle.

836
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:10,691
Nice scar.

837
01:11:15,855 --> 01:11:19,029
You never could keep yourself
out of trouble, either.

838
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:24,030
What else do you know about me?

839
01:11:25,031 --> 01:11:26,533
About you?

840
01:11:29,035 --> 01:11:30,537
Everything.

841
01:11:37,376 --> 01:11:39,549
Like this scar.

842
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:43,307
You got that the first night we met.
You were 15.

843
01:11:43,466 --> 01:11:45,719
First street race.

844
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:50,477
Some kid trying to show off
lost control of his car,

845
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:53,234
wiped out right next to you.

846
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:55,736
You're lucky
you didn't lose your arm.

847
01:11:55,895 --> 01:11:57,317
And let me guess,

848
01:11:58,064 --> 01:11:59,907
you saved me.

849
01:12:00,066 --> 01:12:01,568
No.

850
01:12:02,235 --> 01:12:04,408
I was the kid showing off.

851
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:08,916
And here...

852
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:17,257
Boyle Heights.

853
01:12:18,251 --> 01:12:22,347
You were fleeing with my little sister
Mia and got trapped in a corner.

854
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:25,762
And you thought
it was a good idea

855
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:29,600
to ride your Torino Cobra
through a retaining wall.

856
01:12:32,265 --> 01:12:36,020
All right, how about this one?

857
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:42,779
That's the last time
we were together.

858
01:12:44,277 --> 01:12:46,279
In the DR.

859
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,874
You wanted to go
for a night swim.

860
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,453
You cut yourself on the reef.

861
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:55,542
I followed you.

862
01:12:57,290 --> 01:13:00,134
I even got this scar to match.

863
01:13:02,628 --> 01:13:04,801
Look, I don't know
why you're here,

864
01:13:04,964 --> 01:13:07,808
but I really think
you're over your head.

865
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:18,319
I'm here for you.

866
01:13:22,523 --> 01:13:24,617
That girl you remember,

867
01:13:26,444 --> 01:13:28,117
it's not me.

868
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:32,367
Not from what I just saw.

869
01:13:34,577 --> 01:13:36,250
Like it or not,

870
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:40,087
you're still the same girl.

871
01:13:43,294 --> 01:13:45,592
I saw it out there.

872
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:49,429
I see it right now.

873
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:53,308
I got to go.

874
01:13:55,556 --> 01:13:57,433
Hey.

875
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:09,491
It belongs to you.

876
01:14:43,938 --> 01:14:45,690
There she goes,

877
01:14:45,856 --> 01:14:47,324
leaving you again.

878
01:14:49,443 --> 01:14:51,286
Bloody fickle, that one.

879
01:14:52,446 --> 01:14:54,540
You want bloody?
We could do bloody.

880
01:14:58,035 --> 01:14:59,537
A street kid,

881
01:15:00,538 --> 01:15:03,337
starts out stealing
DVD players in East L.A.,

882
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:08,380
ends up heisting
$100 million in Rio.

883
01:15:08,713 --> 01:15:10,215
Not bad, huh?

884
01:15:10,381 --> 01:15:12,383
It's a good story, isn't it?

885
01:15:13,551 --> 01:15:15,394
Almost inspiring.

886
01:15:16,721 --> 01:15:19,190
See, what I couldn't fathom is

887
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,813
why he's not relaxing
on a beach somewhere

888
01:15:21,892 --> 01:15:24,395
with that cute little
Brazilian number.

889
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:30,360
Instead, he's working with a two-bit
government hack like Hobbs.

890
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:34,868
And then I realized,

891
01:15:37,324 --> 01:15:38,917
he has a weak spot.

892
01:15:40,661 --> 01:15:43,084
We all got a weak spot.

893
01:15:43,914 --> 01:15:45,166
You know,

894
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:49,846
when I was young, my brother
always used to say,

895
01:15:50,004 --> 01:15:52,553
"Every man has
to have a code."

896
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:54,759
Mine?

897
01:15:55,259 --> 01:15:56,727
Precision.

898
01:15:58,054 --> 01:16:01,934
A team is nothing but pieces you
switch out until you get the job done.

899
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:03,351
It's efficient.

900
01:16:03,934 --> 01:16:05,231
It works.

901
01:16:06,270 --> 01:16:07,567
But you?

902
01:16:10,107 --> 01:16:11,950
You're loyal to a fault.

903
01:16:12,693 --> 01:16:15,037
Your code is about family.

904
01:16:16,322 --> 01:16:19,826
And that's great in the holidays,
but it makes you predictable.

905
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:22,453
And in our line of work,
predictable means vulnerable.

906
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:26,215
And that means I can reach out
and break you whenever I want.

907
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:29,426
At least when I go,
I'll know what it's for.

908
01:16:30,961 --> 01:16:32,304
Well,

909
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:35,303
at least you have a code.

910
01:16:37,802 --> 01:16:39,145
Most men don't.

911
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:44,437
So.

912
01:16:45,643 --> 01:16:47,441
I'm going to give you a chance.

913
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:51,073
Take your crew and walk away.

914
01:16:51,232 --> 01:16:53,826
That's the only way you're going
to keep your family safe.

915
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:59,324
Your brother never told you never
to threaten a man's family?

916
01:17:01,158 --> 01:17:03,411
It's a pretty stupid
thing to do.

917
01:17:05,579 --> 01:17:08,002
But I'll make it
simple for you.

918
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:12,337
I walk away
when she walks away.

919
01:17:13,838 --> 01:17:15,090
Well, then,

920
01:17:17,174 --> 01:17:20,144
it appears this inspiring
tale has come to an end.

921
01:17:28,185 --> 01:17:29,858
If that's the way it has to go.

922
01:17:36,944 --> 01:17:38,946
Let me guess...

923
01:17:40,281 --> 01:17:41,328
Hobbs.

924
01:17:44,702 --> 01:17:47,296
Come on, you son of a bitch.

925
01:17:48,038 --> 01:17:50,006
The "two-bit
government hack."

926
01:17:57,381 --> 01:17:59,054
See you around, Toretto.

927
01:17:59,216 --> 01:18:00,718
You can bet on it.

928
01:18:15,482 --> 01:18:18,577
Riley, Shaw's leaving
Battersea, heading southeast.

929
01:18:18,736 --> 01:18:20,409
Have Tej track him
on his live feed. Go.

930
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:23,078
You know what
would have happened

931
01:18:23,157 --> 01:18:25,785
if I didn't put that
tracker in your car?

932
01:18:28,162 --> 01:18:29,334
This one?

933
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:40,595
You know, this just got me
one step closer to Shaw.

934
01:18:41,091 --> 01:18:42,934
For what it's worth, Toretto,

935
01:18:43,344 --> 01:18:46,097
I hope it gets you closer
to what you want, too.

936
01:19:02,112 --> 01:19:03,955
This better have been worth it.

937
01:19:04,448 --> 01:19:06,416
More than you'll ever know.

938
01:19:53,289 --> 01:19:54,506
Pretty.

939
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:00,467
May I?

940
01:20:14,393 --> 01:20:17,146
I'm going to ask you
a question, Letty,

941
01:20:18,022 --> 01:20:21,902
and I want you to think very
hard before you answer.

942
01:20:22,318 --> 01:20:24,867
When I give you the order

943
01:20:25,029 --> 01:20:26,451
to take Toretto out,

944
01:20:29,033 --> 01:20:31,456
what will your
first thought be?

945
01:20:33,287 --> 01:20:35,790
Why don't you
look me in the eye

946
01:20:36,915 --> 01:20:40,715
and you tell me what you see.

947
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:50,975
Keep it.

948
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:02,858
Tej, talk to me,
what have we got?

949
01:21:03,025 --> 01:21:05,369
We were able to track Shaw
after he left you and Dom,

950
01:21:05,527 --> 01:21:08,155
but this guy's smart, so we
could only track him so far.

951
01:21:08,322 --> 01:21:10,700
He seems to know all
the city's blind spots.

952
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:12,227
See, we lost him
somewhere in here,

953
01:21:12,326 --> 01:21:13,566
which means
he could be anywhere

954
01:21:13,577 --> 01:21:15,295
within that
half-a-mile radius.

955
01:21:15,454 --> 01:21:18,378
Maybe if we cross-reference
phone records, leases...

956
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:20,588
No, this has got Shaw's
name written all over it.

957
01:21:20,751 --> 01:21:22,879
We've got vantage points,
multiple exits,

958
01:21:22,961 --> 01:21:24,508
subways, highways
and storm drains.

959
01:21:24,671 --> 01:21:26,173
Bad-ass and brains.

960
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:28,460
Woman, you keep that up,
I'm going to be out of a job.

961
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:31,311
All right, let's go
nail that son of a bitch.

962
01:21:55,119 --> 01:21:56,166
They're long gone.

963
01:21:56,703 --> 01:21:58,797
There's nothing here.

964
01:22:06,964 --> 01:22:08,432
There's never nothing.

965
01:22:16,432 --> 01:22:18,560
There's always something.

966
01:22:24,857 --> 01:22:26,359
Let's go, guys.

967
01:22:28,068 --> 01:22:32,244
Shaw, everyone is in place. All
things moving according to plan.

968
01:22:35,451 --> 01:22:37,453
Good. Send him in.

969
01:22:40,747 --> 01:22:42,715
Yo, it's Hobbs.

970
01:22:44,126 --> 01:22:46,379
What have you got, Parker?
Give me something good.

971
01:22:46,545 --> 01:22:50,140
Yeah, that paint you got from
Shaw's place is highly specialized.

972
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:52,472
Anti-thermal
low-IR coating.

973
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:54,602
Military.
Exactly.

974
01:22:54,761 --> 01:22:57,435
We got a list of bases around
Europe that use this paint type

975
01:22:57,598 --> 01:22:58,770
and those specific colors.

976
01:22:58,932 --> 01:23:00,275
All right,
let's cross-reference that

977
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:02,148
with all of Shaw's
military targets.

978
01:23:02,311 --> 01:23:04,609
I guaran-damn-tee you
one of them is gonna match.

979
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:09,326
Bingo.
It's a NATO base in Spain.

980
01:23:09,485 --> 01:23:10,965
That puts Shaw
in a different country.

981
01:23:11,403 --> 01:23:12,905
That means he's got
an eight-hour lead on us.

982
01:23:13,071 --> 01:23:15,244
<i>We gotta move now.
Tej, give me that info.</i>

983
01:23:15,574 --> 01:23:17,747
Riley and I will go ahead and we're
going to lock down the base.

984
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:20,004
We're going to protect
that component personally.

985
01:23:20,162 --> 01:23:22,881
Toretto, I'll arrange transportation
for you and your cars.

986
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:26,840
You brush up on your Spanish, boys.
I'll see you <i>en España.</i>

987
01:23:49,358 --> 01:23:52,282
You son of a bitch!
You made it!

988
01:23:52,819 --> 01:23:54,162
What up, man?
Good to see you.

989
01:23:54,321 --> 01:23:56,699
Good to see you.
So, what's going on here?

990
01:23:56,865 --> 01:23:58,663
Figured out they're hitting
an army base in Spain.

991
01:23:58,825 --> 01:24:01,499
Border patrol ID'ed Shaw's men
crossing through last night.

992
01:24:01,662 --> 01:24:03,756
Hobbs and Riley went
to lock down the base.

993
01:24:03,914 --> 01:24:05,336
- They're going to meet us there.
- Where's Dom?

994
01:24:05,499 --> 01:24:07,251
He wasn't going without you.

995
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:15,638
I found out
what happened to Letty.

996
01:24:16,343 --> 01:24:18,391
It's all my fault.

997
01:24:19,388 --> 01:24:20,514
Brian,

998
01:24:21,431 --> 01:24:24,776
whatever you found out,
that's for you.

999
01:24:25,352 --> 01:24:27,320
What we're about to do now

1000
01:24:28,772 --> 01:24:30,615
is for her.

1001
01:24:34,027 --> 01:24:36,075
We've got
four teams on overwatch,

1002
01:24:36,238 --> 01:24:39,037
sniper-spotters in roosts
north and south of the target.

1003
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:40,701
Just keep all your men
out of sight.

1004
01:24:40,784 --> 01:24:41,876
When they drive
that truck in here,

1005
01:24:41,952 --> 01:24:44,580
I want to come crashing down on
them like the walls of Jericho.

1006
01:24:44,746 --> 01:24:49,252
Hobbs, I just caught this one disabling
the perimeter security system.

1007
01:24:49,418 --> 01:24:51,637
Your house is compromised.
What are you suggesting?

1008
01:24:51,795 --> 01:24:52,842
I ain't suggesting.

1009
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:55,140
We follow protocol,
we move the component out.

1010
01:24:55,299 --> 01:24:58,259
Shaw thinks it's here. We're going to
get it out of here before he arrives.

1011
01:24:58,302 --> 01:25:00,179
Stealth and speed are going
to be our two best friends.

1012
01:25:00,262 --> 01:25:02,435
We're going to protect our little
egg, move it out of the henhouse,

1013
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:05,852
then we're going to wait for
that goddamn fox to arrive.

1014
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:11,736
I just got word they caught one
of Shaw's men at the base.

1015
01:25:11,898 --> 01:25:13,024
It's time.

1016
01:25:13,191 --> 01:25:16,821
Something is not right.
He wanted us to find that guy.

1017
01:25:16,987 --> 01:25:19,866
Think about it. At Interpol, you
were face-to-face with him.

1018
01:25:20,616 --> 01:25:21,977
Brian, so what are you saying?

1019
01:25:22,367 --> 01:25:27,373
Braga said the only way you get
near Shaw is if he wants you to.

1020
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:29,838
Tej, where's that component?

1021
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:31,843
They're moving it
to a secure location.

1022
01:25:36,882 --> 01:25:38,555
Shaw ain't hitting that base.

1023
01:25:38,717 --> 01:25:39,934
He's hitting the convoy.

1024
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:16,467
Let's go!

1025
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,294
We've got a report,
the convoy's under attack.

1026
01:26:47,369 --> 01:26:48,416
Get a chopper, now!

1027
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:07,476
Fellas, you better hurry up.
They just took the convoy.

1028
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:12,402
And Dom,

1029
01:27:12,644 --> 01:27:14,146
<i>Letty's with them.</i>

1030
01:27:14,896 --> 01:27:17,240
We stick to the plan.

1031
01:27:23,905 --> 01:27:25,065
All right, you heard the man.

1032
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:26,313
Let's play this fast and clean.

1033
01:27:26,324 --> 01:27:27,524
That thing's heading your way.

1034
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:06,702
<i>All systems go.</i>

1035
01:28:06,865 --> 01:28:08,867
Everything looks stable.

1036
01:28:09,534 --> 01:28:11,707
Uh, guys, we gotta
come up with another plan.

1037
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:16,041
They got a tank.

1038
01:28:16,208 --> 01:28:18,631
I'm sorry, did somebody
just say "a tank"?

1039
01:28:24,883 --> 01:28:26,135
We got company, guys.

1040
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:28,554
<i>Toretto is coming right at you.</i>

1041
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:31,348
Okay. Get the weapons hot.

1042
01:28:32,891 --> 01:28:34,893
Give me satellite imaging.

1043
01:29:28,905 --> 01:29:30,703
Straight ahead of us.

1044
01:29:31,449 --> 01:29:32,917
There you are.

1045
01:29:47,757 --> 01:29:49,100
Who's got a plan B?

1046
01:29:49,259 --> 01:29:51,808
Plan B?
We need a plan C, D, E.

1047
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:53,142
<i>We need more alphabets!</i>

1048
01:29:53,305 --> 01:29:56,434
Hey, we do what we do best.

1049
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:58,068
We improvise, all right?

1050
01:30:14,326 --> 01:30:17,330
Okay, Jah.
Take it to the other side.

1051
01:30:17,495 --> 01:30:18,838
Let's have some fun.

1052
01:30:34,679 --> 01:30:37,273
What the hell is wrong with you?
This isn't part of the plan.

1053
01:30:49,986 --> 01:30:52,034
Take their attention
away from the people!

1054
01:31:05,210 --> 01:31:07,008
Shaw, you don't
have to do this.

1055
01:31:18,056 --> 01:31:19,729
We got one right
in front of us.

1056
01:31:20,058 --> 01:31:21,150
Boom.

1057
01:31:23,019 --> 01:31:24,066
Oh, shit!

1058
01:31:31,361 --> 01:31:32,738
You lucky bastard.

1059
01:31:33,863 --> 01:31:35,490
Roman, you hang in there.

1060
01:31:35,657 --> 01:31:37,250
<i>Hang in there, mam!</i>

1061
01:31:40,662 --> 01:31:44,337
Somebody better do something!
I got a tank on my ass!

1062
01:31:46,668 --> 01:31:48,261
There's gotta be
a break up ahead.

1063
01:31:52,757 --> 01:31:53,883
Oh, look,

1064
01:31:54,884 --> 01:31:55,931
a bridge.

1065
01:32:26,082 --> 01:32:27,129
Screw it.

1066
01:32:58,281 --> 01:32:59,908
Yeah!

1067
01:33:03,328 --> 01:33:05,171
We're dragging a car behind us.

1068
01:33:06,623 --> 01:33:09,297
Brian, that Mustang
would make a nice anchor.

1069
01:33:09,459 --> 01:33:10,631
Yeah, I'm on it.

1070
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:36,861
Damn!

1071
01:33:37,028 --> 01:33:38,780
Shaw, we've got to
get rid of that car.

1072
01:33:38,947 --> 01:33:41,496
Letty, go take care
of the cable.

1073
01:33:57,048 --> 01:33:58,140
Yeah!

1074
01:34:00,885 --> 01:34:02,228
What's she doing?

1075
01:34:02,387 --> 01:34:03,559
Shit!

1076
01:34:04,430 --> 01:34:05,898
Okay, Toretto.

1077
01:34:08,685 --> 01:34:09,732
Here's your girl...

1078
01:34:12,856 --> 01:34:14,449
And your happy ending.

1079
01:34:14,607 --> 01:34:15,779
Letty!

1080
01:34:51,102 --> 01:34:53,605
Jesus Christ.

1081
01:35:01,070 --> 01:35:03,164
I can't believe they
stole a 70-ton tank

1082
01:35:03,281 --> 01:35:04,578
for a three-ounce
computer chip.

1083
01:35:04,741 --> 01:35:08,621
That 3-ounce computer chip is more
deadly than 1,000 of those tanks.

1084
01:35:12,165 --> 01:35:13,792
What about her?

1085
01:35:14,292 --> 01:35:15,965
Not her.

1086
01:35:16,127 --> 01:35:17,595
She was working with Shaw.

1087
01:35:17,754 --> 01:35:18,846
Was,

1088
01:35:20,965 --> 01:35:22,967
but she's always
been one of us.

1089
01:35:26,095 --> 01:35:28,018
Let's give them a minute.

1090
01:35:41,861 --> 01:35:43,829
Let's go process
Shaw and his crew.

1091
01:35:43,988 --> 01:35:47,162
I've never looked more forward to
filling out paperwork in my life.

1092
01:36:03,883 --> 01:36:05,180
Hey.

1093
01:36:08,513 --> 01:36:11,858
Look, I don't even know
how to say this to you,

1094
01:36:16,562 --> 01:36:18,860
but everything that's happened
here is because of me.

1095
01:36:19,524 --> 01:36:21,004
I'm the one that
put you undercover...

1096
01:36:21,025 --> 01:36:22,698
Stop.

1097
01:36:23,695 --> 01:36:25,368
I may not remember anything,

1098
01:36:26,698 --> 01:36:29,417
but I know one thing
about myself.

1099
01:36:29,701 --> 01:36:32,921
Nobody makes me do
anything I don't want to.

1100
01:36:45,383 --> 01:36:48,512
So, what's our next
adventure after this?

1101
01:36:50,430 --> 01:36:54,105
How about we stay in one place?

1102
01:36:55,059 --> 01:36:56,231
Where are you thinking?

1103
01:36:56,394 --> 01:36:57,896
Tokyo.

1104
01:36:58,521 --> 01:37:00,899
We always talk about Tokyo.

1105
01:37:02,233 --> 01:37:04,611
Tokyo it is.

1106
01:37:11,034 --> 01:37:13,753
Can I ask you something?

1107
01:37:21,794 --> 01:37:26,049
How did you know that there would
be a car there to break our fall?

1108
01:37:26,758 --> 01:37:28,260
I didn't.

1109
01:37:32,221 --> 01:37:35,816
Some things you just
have to take on faith.

1110
01:37:37,477 --> 01:37:38,899
Hey, Toretto!

1111
01:37:39,062 --> 01:37:40,780
You need to hear this.

1112
01:37:54,619 --> 01:37:57,623
You guys really
think you've won.

1113
01:37:58,623 --> 01:38:00,250
This code you live by,

1114
01:38:01,125 --> 01:38:04,299
it's the very reason why you
weren't even in the game.

1115
01:38:06,964 --> 01:38:10,309
I told you exactly what I was gonna
do if you didn't walk away, Toretto.

1116
01:38:11,344 --> 01:38:12,436
Go!

1117
01:38:13,262 --> 01:38:14,809
But you didn't listen.

1118
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:19,861
<i>I told you I can reach out and
break you whenever I want.</i>

1119
01:38:22,438 --> 01:38:24,065
And I have.

1120
01:38:24,148 --> 01:38:25,274
Come on.

1121
01:38:28,319 --> 01:38:29,536
Go.
No!

1122
01:38:29,695 --> 01:38:31,868
Maybe you should call Mia.

1123
01:38:45,545 --> 01:38:47,047
Mia?
Brian!

1124
01:38:50,508 --> 01:38:51,851
Let me go!

1125
01:39:05,148 --> 01:39:07,867
So, this is how
it's gonna go down.

1126
01:39:08,401 --> 01:39:10,369
You're gonna cut me
loose from these cuffs,

1127
01:39:10,820 --> 01:39:12,072
you're gonna hand me the chip,

1128
01:39:12,238 --> 01:39:14,399
I'm gonna walk out of here
and you're not gonna follow.

1129
01:39:14,407 --> 01:39:16,580
You must be joking.

1130
01:39:20,580 --> 01:39:21,832
Look at his face.

1131
01:39:25,835 --> 01:39:27,212
Ask him if I'm joking.

1132
01:39:27,378 --> 01:39:32,100
One hostage does not outweigh
the threat to millions.

1133
01:39:33,176 --> 01:39:36,931
I'm sorry,
but this changes nothing.

1134
01:39:42,018 --> 01:39:43,361
It changes everything.

1135
01:39:44,729 --> 01:39:47,448
You tell your men
to stand down.

1136
01:39:50,234 --> 01:39:52,077
Stand down.

1137
01:39:54,363 --> 01:39:55,410
Toretto,

1138
01:39:56,407 --> 01:39:57,624
I need you to know,

1139
01:39:57,909 --> 01:40:01,379
the moment we let him walk out
that door with that chip,

1140
01:40:01,537 --> 01:40:04,586
words like
"amnesty" and "pardon"

1141
01:40:04,749 --> 01:40:06,422
walk outwith him.

1142
01:40:12,089 --> 01:40:15,935
Those words went out
the day we were born.

1143
01:40:45,289 --> 01:40:46,962
Coming, babe?

1144
01:40:52,463 --> 01:40:53,806
Of course.

1145
01:40:55,633 --> 01:40:57,306
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

1146
01:41:01,138 --> 01:41:02,811
Like I said,

1147
01:41:04,308 --> 01:41:06,652
you were never in the game.

1148
01:41:07,395 --> 01:41:11,491
If I see you on the horizon, I'll
make the call and the girl's dead.

1149
01:41:24,662 --> 01:41:26,756
So, what about
Toretto's sister?

1150
01:41:28,583 --> 01:41:30,335
There's no need
for her anymore.

1151
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:38,764
I just jammed every signal
up and down the spectrum.

1152
01:41:41,012 --> 01:41:42,685
Let's move.

1153
01:41:42,847 --> 01:41:45,191
I'm coming with you.

1154
01:42:18,299 --> 01:42:20,222
Where the hell does this dude
think he's going?

1155
01:42:20,384 --> 01:42:22,227
We're on an army base,
he's trapped.

1156
01:42:30,728 --> 01:42:32,981
Wow, you just had
to open your mouth.

1157
01:42:33,272 --> 01:42:35,274
Now we got a big-ass
plane to deal with.

1158
01:42:35,441 --> 01:42:37,614
That ain't a plane.
That's a planet.

1159
01:42:54,585 --> 01:42:58,431
She's as good as dead if Shaw
gets away on that plane.

1160
01:43:02,176 --> 01:43:04,099
Then we don't let him get away.

1161
01:43:11,769 --> 01:43:13,942
Let's end this thing.

1162
01:43:22,488 --> 01:43:23,740
Ride or die.

1163
01:43:24,824 --> 01:43:25,916
Ride or die.

1164
01:44:51,535 --> 01:44:52,912
Tell them to take off!

1165
01:45:03,756 --> 01:45:05,053
Babe, get me under the wing.

1166
01:45:05,216 --> 01:45:07,719
If I can hit that flap, we
can keep it from taking off.

1167
01:45:12,723 --> 01:45:13,895
You be careful.

1168
01:45:14,892 --> 01:45:16,735
This is who we are.

1169
01:45:28,906 --> 01:45:29,907
Shit!

1170
01:45:33,577 --> 01:45:34,578
Grab the wheel!

1171
01:46:24,420 --> 01:46:25,467
Dom!

1172
01:46:32,678 --> 01:46:33,770
Go!

1173
01:46:33,971 --> 01:46:35,268
Come on. Let's go.

1174
01:46:51,488 --> 01:46:52,614
Get in the car.

1175
01:48:26,333 --> 01:48:27,334
Whoo!

1176
01:50:03,138 --> 01:50:04,685
What happened?
Did you hit the flap?

1177
01:50:05,307 --> 01:50:06,308
Uh...

1178
01:50:06,975 --> 01:50:08,352
You should buckle up right now.

1179
01:50:08,477 --> 01:50:09,524
What?

1180
01:50:25,369 --> 01:50:26,461
Hey!

1181
01:50:30,541 --> 01:50:31,667
Wrong team, bitch.

1182
01:51:16,420 --> 01:51:17,421
Shit.

1183
01:51:38,483 --> 01:51:39,484
Yeah!

1184
01:51:55,834 --> 01:51:57,177
I got you.

1185
01:53:05,487 --> 01:53:06,579
Tej!

1186
01:53:06,989 --> 01:53:08,081
Keep her steady!

1187
01:53:08,740 --> 01:53:10,663
We gotta move, it's going down!
Go!

1188
01:53:15,372 --> 01:53:17,090
Go, now!

1189
01:53:20,377 --> 01:53:22,345
Come on,
let's move, move, move!

1190
01:53:28,593 --> 01:53:29,594
Come on!

1191
01:53:33,682 --> 01:53:35,025
Dom!

1192
01:56:40,118 --> 01:56:41,745
Where's Gisele?

1193
01:56:45,749 --> 01:56:47,592
Where's Gisele?

1194
01:57:16,655 --> 01:57:19,750
So this is worth billions, huh?

1195
01:57:24,287 --> 01:57:25,664
Yes, it is.

1196
01:57:30,460 --> 01:57:31,757
Name your price, Dom.

1197
01:57:36,675 --> 01:57:39,144
1327.

1198
01:58:05,120 --> 01:58:06,872
Don't burn it this time.
Please?

1199
01:58:07,038 --> 01:58:09,382
I never go and burn it, man.

1200
01:58:11,543 --> 01:58:13,136
Good food.

1201
01:58:13,628 --> 01:58:17,804
The air quality here is
lousy, the traffic is bad,

1202
01:58:18,550 --> 01:58:20,270
but I think you'll
learn to like this place.

1203
01:58:20,385 --> 01:58:22,888
Yeah, and here you've
got your own garage

1204
01:58:23,013 --> 01:58:24,981
so you can build
a car with Daddy.

1205
01:58:25,056 --> 01:58:26,148
We'll be building a car?

1206
01:58:26,224 --> 01:58:28,727
First car better
be a Charger, Jack.

1207
01:58:29,728 --> 01:58:30,980
You mean Skyline.

1208
01:58:32,230 --> 01:58:34,403
Like I said, he's a Toretto.

1209
01:58:34,733 --> 01:58:36,076
You're confusing the kid.

1210
01:58:36,234 --> 01:58:37,406
Mia, you're gonna let him
get away with this?

1211
01:58:37,569 --> 01:58:38,991
You're really going to do it?

1212
01:58:39,821 --> 01:58:40,868
Tokyo.

1213
01:58:42,073 --> 01:58:44,747
Yeah, it's just
something I gotta do.

1214
01:58:44,909 --> 01:58:48,254
You know we got your back,
whenever you need us.

1215
01:58:52,334 --> 01:58:54,757
Hey, Mia, you better
hide your baby oil.

1216
01:58:54,836 --> 01:58:55,837
I'm just playing.

1217
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:57,593
You better hide that big-ass forehead.

1218
01:58:57,756 --> 01:58:59,008
I was just joking,
but whatever.

1219
01:58:59,507 --> 01:59:00,929
Definitely not that funny.

1220
01:59:01,092 --> 01:59:02,765
It's official.

1221
01:59:02,927 --> 01:59:04,099
You're all free.

1222
01:59:04,179 --> 01:59:05,556
Mmm.
Mmm.

1223
01:59:08,099 --> 01:59:10,602
It wasn't half bad,
having you work for me.

1224
01:59:12,937 --> 01:59:15,281
We all know you were
working for me, Hobbs.

1225
01:59:15,940 --> 01:59:18,238
Agree to disagree.

1226
01:59:18,401 --> 01:59:19,448
Thank you.

1227
01:59:20,403 --> 01:59:21,620
Good luck.

1228
01:59:23,281 --> 01:59:24,282
Elena?

1229
01:59:24,449 --> 01:59:25,541
Letty.

1230
01:59:25,617 --> 01:59:27,619
This is gonna be awkward.

1231
01:59:28,119 --> 01:59:30,292
But sexy as hell.
Sexy as hell.

1232
01:59:30,955 --> 01:59:33,959
I wanted to thank you for
everything you've done for him.

1233
01:59:34,417 --> 01:59:35,760
For us.

1234
01:59:36,294 --> 01:59:38,296
It takes an amazing woman.

1235
01:59:40,256 --> 01:59:41,803
He's an amazing guy.

1236
01:59:42,467 --> 01:59:43,969
Yeah, he is.

1237
01:59:45,470 --> 01:59:47,768
Try to keep him
out of trouble, huh?

1238
01:59:49,140 --> 01:59:51,734
Now, you know
that's not gonna happen.

1239
01:59:52,644 --> 01:59:53,816
I know.

1240
01:59:56,773 --> 01:59:59,117
Not bad for a cop.

1241
02:00:06,700 --> 02:00:09,544
I never thought
I'd trust a criminal.

1242
02:00:12,205 --> 02:00:13,957
Until next time.

1243
02:00:14,541 --> 02:00:17,294
Until next time.

1244
02:00:23,717 --> 02:00:24,764
Elena.

1245
02:00:33,643 --> 02:00:35,065
You know you don't have to go.

1246
02:00:38,064 --> 02:00:41,534
All this...
This is your family.

1247
02:00:42,569 --> 02:00:44,412
It's who you are.

1248
02:00:44,821 --> 02:00:46,744
This is my family.

1249
02:00:49,075 --> 02:00:50,918
This is who I am.

1250
02:01:09,095 --> 02:01:10,535
All right,
everybody, let's eat.

1251
02:01:10,764 --> 02:01:12,004
Want some help with that?

1252
02:01:12,015 --> 02:01:13,562
It's all here, it's done.

1253
02:01:14,434 --> 02:01:16,778
Come on, man,
let's get with it.

1254
02:01:19,606 --> 02:01:21,279
First bite, he's got grace.

1255
02:01:21,441 --> 02:01:23,114
House rules, man.
House rules.

1256
02:01:25,528 --> 02:01:28,122
Any of this feel
familiar to you?

1257
02:01:32,243 --> 02:01:33,790
No.

1258
02:01:36,414 --> 02:01:38,542
But it feels like home.

1259
02:01:39,375 --> 02:01:40,718
That's good enough for me.

1260
02:01:41,503 --> 02:01:44,006
All right, y'all.
Come on, let's do this.

1261
02:01:44,881 --> 02:01:46,599
Okay, Roman,

1262
02:01:48,301 --> 02:01:50,099
bless our table.

1263
02:01:55,725 --> 02:01:58,979
Father, thank you for
the gathering of friends.

1264
02:01:59,145 --> 02:02:01,944
Father, we give thanks for
all the choices we've made,

1265
02:02:02,106 --> 02:02:04,700
because that's what
makes us who we are.

1266
02:02:04,859 --> 02:02:08,580
Let us forever cherish the loved
ones we've lost along the way.

1267
02:02:08,738 --> 02:02:10,285
Thank you for the little angel,

1268
02:02:10,365 --> 02:02:12,333
the newest addition
to our family.

1269
02:02:12,492 --> 02:02:14,335
Thank you for
bringing Letty home.

1270
02:02:14,494 --> 02:02:18,169
And most of all,
thank you for fast cars.

1271
02:04:22,372 --> 02:04:24,591
Dominic Toretto.

1272
02:04:24,749 --> 02:04:26,001
You don't know me,

1273
02:04:27,835 --> 02:04:29,587
but you're about to.

1274
02:04:30,305 --> 02:05:30,726
