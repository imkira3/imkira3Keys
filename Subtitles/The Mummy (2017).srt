have neglected

she was exhausted

00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,793
we've developed
this theory

00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,839
that an Egyptian princess had been
erased from the history books

575
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,349
deliberately.

576

We've been searching for something
called the Dagger of Set.

577
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,231
A ceremonial knife with a
large jewel at the hilt.

578
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,910
Set is the Egyptian
god of death.

579
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,029
And legend has it that the
dagger and the stone, together,

580
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,512
had the power to
give Set physical form.

581
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,709
I'm convinced it was
hidden here in Europe.

Stolen by Crusaders
centuries ago.

583
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:55,510
I found reference to it in a manuscript
written by a Crusader knight

584
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,189
that suggested the dagger was broken apart.
(AHMANET SCREAMING)

585
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:05,395
That the stone was buried with this
knight somewhere here in England.

586
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,953
A massive Crusader tomb was
recently discovered under London.

587
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,077
We believe that the stone
is in there somewhere.

00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,637
That tomb is what
led us to Ahmanet.

589
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,995
I think she's the
princess in the legend.

590
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,389
The hieroglyphs said
she murdered her father.

Murdered?
Along with his child.

592
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:32,591

with the god of death.

01:35:32,240 --> 01:35:33,240
(GASPS)

1301
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:37,800
Nick.

1302
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:40,995
Nick. Nick?

1303
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:42,275
NICK: Stop!
(GASPS)

1304
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:44,638
Stop. Please.

1305
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:50,075
I don't know what I am.

1306
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:54,240
I don't want to
hurt you, Jenny.

1307
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:55,355
You're alive.

1308
01:35:56,280 --> 01:35:57,759
You're alive.

1309
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:00,990
I'm so glad you're alive.

1310
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:03,828
Oh, Nick.

1311
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:07,879
You did this for me?

1312
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:10,794
Yes.

1313
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:16,353
I have made so many,
many mistakes.

1314
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:19,951
But not this time.

1315
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:22,399
Not you.

1316
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:26,591
I don't want to hurt you.

1317
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:29,796
I never wanted to hurt you.

1318
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:32,559
You won't.

1319
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:38,030
Didn't see this coming,
did we?

1320
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:43,320
(SNARLS)

1321
01:36:43,640 --> 01:36:44,640
(GASPS)

1322
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,877
They're coming for me.

1323
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:52,914
I wish we had more time.

1324
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:56,518
I'll find you.

1325
01:36:58,040 --> 01:37:00,395
Goodbye, Jenny.

1326
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:01,600
(MEN SHOUTING)

1327
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:36,436
JENNY: You were wrong
about Nick.

1328
01:37:37,120 --> 01:37:39,554
He gave his life to save me.

1329
01:37:41,320 --> 01:37:42,958
To bring me back.

1330
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:48,598
Yes, Jennifer.

1331
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:53,113
He found his redemption,
but at great cost.

1332
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:56,871
He is a monster now.

1333
01:37:58,040 --> 01:38:00,235
JENNY:
He is also still a man.

1334
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:02,319
A good man.

1335
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:04,553
HENRY: Perhaps.

1336
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:08,278
Yet he has only begun
to discover his power.

1337
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:11,992
And we cannot know
which side will win out.

1338
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:15,431
Between darkness and light,

1339
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:18,238
good or evil.

1340
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:20,951
VAIL: Hey, Nick? Nick.

1341
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:24,791
I'm really glad to be here.

1342
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:27,080
I mean,
thank you for bringing me

1343
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:28,912
back to life
and everything, Nick.

1344
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,991
But what are we
even doing here?

1345
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:33,511
Where are we going?

1346
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:35,192
NICK: Come on, my friend.

1347
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:39,075
Where's your
sense of adventure?

1348
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:44,509
Oh, no.

1349
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:47,750
HENRY: Whatever human
part of him remains

1350
01:38:48,440 --> 01:38:52,513
will search the world over
for a way to break the curse.

1351
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:54,913
To find a cure.

1352
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:58,196
Yet evil never rests.

1353
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:01,235
And it will call to him

1354
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:03,117
always.

1355
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:07,109
JENNY: Henry, he used
his power to stop Ahmanet.

1356
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:11,592
You know more than anyone
he could be our greatest ally.

1357
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:14,508
HENRY: Perhaps.

1358
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:19,631
Sometimes, it does take a
monster to fight a monster.

1358
01:39:20,305 --> 01:40:20,473
