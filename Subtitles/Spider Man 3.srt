1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:21,120
It's me, Peter Parker.
Your friendly neighborhood...

3
00:03:21,245 --> 00:03:22,246
you know.

4
00:03:22,371 --> 00:03:25,498
I've come a long way from being
the boy who was bit by a spider.

5
00:03:25,582 --> 00:03:28,502
Back then, nothing seemed
to go right for me. Now...

6
00:03:28,627 --> 00:03:30,087
Wow, look, it's Spider-Man!

7
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,839
- Super cool!
- Spider-man!

8
00:03:31,964 --> 00:03:34,049
People really like me.

9
00:03:34,258 --> 00:03:36,969
Stick around. It's gonna start again
in a couple minutes.

10
00:03:37,094 --> 00:03:39,763
That's okay.

11
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:42,683
The city is safe and sound.

12
00:03:42,808 --> 00:03:44,768
I guess I've had something
to do with that.

13
00:03:44,893 --> 00:03:46,770
My Uncle Ben would be proud.

14
00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:54,695
I still get to school. Top of my class.

15
00:03:54,778 --> 00:03:56,655
Now, the Hamiltonian shows us...

16
00:03:56,864 --> 00:04:01,243
that the energy levels
are perturbed by the electric field.

17
00:04:03,662 --> 00:04:08,249
From the form of this matrix,
we can see?

18
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,335
Miss Stacy?

19
00:04:10,461 --> 00:04:13,756
That only the "m equals zero
quantum states" are affected.

20
00:04:13,797 --> 00:04:17,009
Correct. Good work, Miss Stacy.

21
00:04:20,888 --> 00:04:24,391
Parker? You got something to add?

22
00:04:25,142 --> 00:04:26,894
No, sir.

23
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:33,484
And I'm in love
with the girl of my dreams.

24
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,250
Hi.

25
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:54,963
Miss Watson left a ticket for me.
Peter Parker.

26
00:04:55,798 --> 00:04:57,341
Excuse me. Sorry.

27
00:04:57,466 --> 00:04:59,968
Thank you. Sorry.

28
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:08,394
I'm so nervous.

29
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:34,461
That's my girlfriend.

30
00:06:48,535 --> 00:06:51,121
- I thought she was good.
- Yeah.

31
00:06:52,581 --> 00:06:53,832
Harry?

32
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,501
Harry!

33
00:06:55,626 --> 00:06:57,669
I need to talk to you.

34
00:06:58,212 --> 00:06:59,963
Explain things.

35
00:07:01,965 --> 00:07:05,719
Tell it to my father.
Raise him from the dead.

36
00:07:07,388 --> 00:07:11,225
I'm your friend, Harry.
I cared about your father.

37
00:07:20,317 --> 00:07:21,235
M. J!

38
00:07:21,485 --> 00:07:23,737
- Peter!
- Congrats!

39
00:07:23,862 --> 00:07:26,240
- Was I good?
- Good? You were great.

40
00:07:26,365 --> 00:07:28,742
- You were...
- You said great.

41
00:07:28,867 --> 00:07:32,496
I love my flowers, they're beautiful.
And those are from Harry.

42
00:07:32,621 --> 00:07:36,583
- Was he here tonight?
- Yeah, I ran into him outside.

43
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:39,920
- What's with you guys anyway?
- It's complicated.

44
00:07:40,003 --> 00:07:42,089
Tell me again. Was I really good?

45
00:07:42,214 --> 00:07:44,591
I was so nervous.
My knees were shaking.

46
00:07:44,717 --> 00:07:47,302
- Your knees were fine.
- The applause wasn't very loud.

47
00:07:47,428 --> 00:07:49,304
Yes, it was. Well, it's the acoustics.

48
00:07:49,513 --> 00:07:52,725
It's all about diffusion. It keeps
the sound waves from grouping.

49
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,768
When the sound waves,
they propagate, then it's like an...

50
00:07:55,769 --> 00:07:57,855
You are such a nerd.

51
00:08:50,616 --> 00:08:52,493
Did you see that one?

52
00:09:01,752 --> 00:09:03,545
You know what?

53
00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:08,634
I'd like to sing on-stage
for the rest of my life...

54
00:09:08,675 --> 00:09:11,136
with you in the first row.

55
00:09:12,429 --> 00:09:14,390
I'll be there.

56
00:09:16,266 --> 00:09:18,560
Tell me you love me.

57
00:09:20,646 --> 00:09:22,731
I love you.

58
00:09:23,023 --> 00:09:25,317
I love you so much.

59
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,153
I always have.

60
00:10:15,909 --> 00:10:17,369
- Ready?
- Yep.

61
00:12:13,026 --> 00:12:15,404
You can't hide here, Flint.

62
00:12:15,821 --> 00:12:19,992
- I'm just here to see my daughter.
- You are an escaped convict.

63
00:12:20,117 --> 00:12:23,954
The cops are looking for you.
You're not getting near her.

64
00:12:24,288 --> 00:12:27,583
You're nothing but a common thief.

65
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:31,253
- You maybe even killed a man?
- It wasn't like that.

66
00:12:31,962 --> 00:12:33,756
It wasn't.

67
00:12:33,881 --> 00:12:36,050
I had good reason
for what I was doing.

68
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:37,384
And that's the truth.

69
00:12:37,634 --> 00:12:41,971
You and the truth, sitting in prison,
having three meals a day together.

70
00:12:41,972 --> 00:12:44,599
I live in the presence of great truth...

71
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,102
and that is the truth
that you left behind...

72
00:12:47,227 --> 00:12:50,105
right there in that bedroom.

73
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,912
Penny.

74
00:13:05,871 --> 00:13:07,539
I missed you.

75
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:11,377
I miss you too, Daddy.

76
00:13:22,262 --> 00:13:25,891
I promise I'll make you healthy again.

77
00:13:26,016 --> 00:13:29,018
Whatever it takes, I'll get the money.

78
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:32,356
You get out of here. Now.

79
00:13:43,409 --> 00:13:45,494
I'm not a bad person.

80
00:13:47,287 --> 00:13:49,456
Just had bad luck.

81
00:14:07,307 --> 00:14:08,934
Peter, what is it?

82
00:14:10,811 --> 00:14:12,479
It's M. J.

83
00:14:13,313 --> 00:14:16,859
- I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
- Oh, Peter.

84
00:14:18,861 --> 00:14:23,740
The day your Uncle Ben asked me
to marry him, we were so scared.

85
00:14:23,741 --> 00:14:25,617
And excited.

86
00:14:25,743 --> 00:14:27,494
And very young.

87
00:14:27,619 --> 00:14:30,747
And I loved him so fiercely.

88
00:14:30,748 --> 00:14:32,833
- And you said yes, right?
- No.

89
00:14:33,042 --> 00:14:35,419
I wanted to say yes, but I said no.

90
00:14:35,544 --> 00:14:38,338
I wasn't ready. Neither was he.

91
00:14:38,464 --> 00:14:40,841
So we took our time.

92
00:14:40,966 --> 00:14:43,469
Looked forward to it.

93
00:14:43,594 --> 00:14:47,222
Didn't want to run into something
with nothing to count on but love.

94
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:51,477
A man has to be understanding...

95
00:14:51,602 --> 00:14:54,730
and put his wife before himself.

96
00:14:55,439 --> 00:14:57,941
Can you do that, Peter?

97
00:14:59,526 --> 00:15:02,321
Yeah, I think I can.

98
00:15:02,446 --> 00:15:05,866
Then you have my blessing.

99
00:15:07,951 --> 00:15:11,080
I hope you've considered
a proper proposal.

100
00:15:11,205 --> 00:15:14,541
Your uncle had it all planned.

101
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,627
He took me to the beach
one Sunday.

102
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:19,630
Oh, he was a knockout
in his bathing suit.

103
00:15:19,755 --> 00:15:22,341
And I didn't look too bad myself.

104
00:15:22,466 --> 00:15:24,426
We were very good swimmers.

105
00:15:24,551 --> 00:15:27,137
And it was a beautiful day
and he said:

106
00:15:27,262 --> 00:15:29,223
"Let's swim to the island."

107
00:15:29,348 --> 00:15:34,977
And at the island, we found
a perfect spot by an old tree...

108
00:15:34,978 --> 00:15:38,607
and we lay down
and looked up at the sky.

109
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:42,069
And then he said,
"Close your eyes, May."

110
00:15:42,152 --> 00:15:44,987
And I did.
And then he said, "Open them."

111
00:15:44,988 --> 00:15:46,865
And I did.

112
00:15:47,074 --> 00:15:49,993
And he was holding this ring.

113
00:15:51,245 --> 00:15:52,704
Dazzling...

114
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,581
in front of me.

115
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,461
I thought it was the sun.

116
00:16:01,755 --> 00:16:04,675
We'd be married 50 years...

117
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:08,429
come August if...

118
00:16:15,018 --> 00:16:16,478
So...

119
00:16:18,021 --> 00:16:23,569
I hope you'll make it very special
for Mary Jane.

120
00:16:24,194 --> 00:16:27,322
Do something she'll never forget.

121
00:16:30,242 --> 00:16:31,910
Give her this.

122
00:16:33,704 --> 00:16:36,373
Go on. Take it.

123
00:17:53,534 --> 00:17:56,036
- Harry.
- You knew this was coming, Pete.

124
00:17:59,623 --> 00:18:02,209
Listen to me. I didn't kill your father.

125
00:18:04,086 --> 00:18:06,046
He was trying to kill me.
He killed himself.

126
00:18:06,171 --> 00:18:07,923
Shut up!

127
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,319
I'm still here, Peter.

128
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,387
Hate those things.

129
00:21:16,987 --> 00:21:18,655
Harry?

130
00:21:22,493 --> 00:21:23,952
Harry.

131
00:21:24,912 --> 00:21:26,455
Harry.

132
00:21:31,377 --> 00:21:33,253
Oh, my God.

133
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,470
Harry!

134
00:21:43,347 --> 00:21:45,224
Come on!

135
00:21:47,935 --> 00:21:49,603
God.

136
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,525
- Defib.
- Two hundred.

137
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,402
And clear.

138
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:57,861
No response.

139
00:21:57,945 --> 00:21:59,738
- Recharge, let's go again.
- Go ahead.

140
00:21:59,863 --> 00:22:02,324
- Charging.
- And clear.

141
00:22:02,449 --> 00:22:03,492
No response.

142
00:22:03,617 --> 00:22:06,912
Let's recharge and do it
one more time. And clear.

143
00:22:12,543 --> 00:22:14,128
Captain Stacy.

144
00:22:14,837 --> 00:22:16,088
- What's this?
- Flint Marko.

145
00:22:16,296 --> 00:22:18,382
The guy we tied
to the Ben Parker homicide.

146
00:22:18,507 --> 00:22:20,384
- What about him?
- Broke out of Rikers.

147
00:22:20,592 --> 00:22:21,844
- And?
- He's on the run.

148
00:22:22,052 --> 00:22:24,221
He's in the marshlands.
I think we got him.

149
00:22:28,517 --> 00:22:30,185
There he is.

150
00:22:48,829 --> 00:22:51,874
You two, take the west side.
Tommy, take the east.

151
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,921
Where did he go?

152
00:23:19,943 --> 00:23:21,570
- Capacitors charged.
- Right.

153
00:23:21,695 --> 00:23:23,781
Donnie, we got a little fluctuation
on one.

154
00:23:23,989 --> 00:23:27,743
- There's a change in the silicon mass.
- It's probably a bird. It'll fly away.

155
00:23:27,868 --> 00:23:29,703
Initiating demolecularization.

156
00:24:59,626 --> 00:25:01,670
- How is he?
- He's gonna be okay.

157
00:25:01,795 --> 00:25:04,298
But there's been
some memory impairment.

158
00:25:04,381 --> 00:25:06,050
Particularly his short-term memory.

159
00:25:06,175 --> 00:25:08,260
Right now he can't
remember the accident...

160
00:25:08,469 --> 00:25:10,637
or anything that happened
to him recently.

161
00:25:10,763 --> 00:25:12,014
Is it permanent?

162
00:25:12,139 --> 00:25:15,225
It could be. Only time will tell.

163
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:17,853
He's awake if you wanna see him.

164
00:25:17,978 --> 00:25:19,313
Maybe I should wait.

165
00:25:19,396 --> 00:25:22,858
No, it's fine. Just keep it brief.
I want him to rest.

166
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,170
Hey, buddy.

167
00:25:43,837 --> 00:25:45,255
Hey.

168
00:25:46,006 --> 00:25:47,549
Hit my head.

169
00:25:47,674 --> 00:25:49,218
Yeah.

170
00:25:49,551 --> 00:25:51,845
Doctor said I was in an accident.

171
00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:53,097
Hit-and-run.

172
00:25:53,722 --> 00:25:56,308
I don't remember much of anything.

173
00:25:57,768 --> 00:25:59,436
My father...

174
00:25:59,978 --> 00:26:01,647
he died, right?

175
00:26:03,857 --> 00:26:06,318
This is all so weird.

176
00:26:07,486 --> 00:26:11,115
Hi. I got here as fast as I could.

177
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,282
I know that face.

178
00:26:12,699 --> 00:26:13,826
How you doing?

179
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,619
I don't know.

180
00:26:15,703 --> 00:26:17,788
Last thing I remember, I was fine.

181
00:26:18,038 --> 00:26:19,164
Somewhere.

182
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,041
You're still fine.

183
00:26:22,626 --> 00:26:24,461
We love you, Harry.

184
00:26:25,129 --> 00:26:27,172
It feels like...

185
00:26:28,048 --> 00:26:31,552
somehow I've been gone
for a really long time.

186
00:26:33,053 --> 00:26:34,805
And now I'm back home.

187
00:26:35,431 --> 00:26:37,599
It's good to have you back.

188
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,687
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to ask
you guys to scoot, okay?

189
00:26:41,812 --> 00:26:44,189
- Okay.
- All right. Thank you.

190
00:26:44,314 --> 00:26:46,275
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

191
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,444
Yeah. Great.

192
00:26:49,194 --> 00:26:50,738
Get some sleep.

193
00:26:54,324 --> 00:26:56,785
- I think he's gonna be fine.
- I think so.

194
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:59,621
- And you guys seem great.
- Yeah.

195
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,418
You have lovely friends.

196
00:27:04,501 --> 00:27:06,712
My best friends.

197
00:27:09,339 --> 00:27:11,508
I'd give my life for them.

198
00:30:21,073 --> 00:30:23,367
- Yeah?
- It's me.

199
00:30:24,201 --> 00:30:25,661
Hey.

200
00:30:25,953 --> 00:30:28,163
Peter, you know I can't open the door.

201
00:30:28,372 --> 00:30:29,832
It's stuck again?

202
00:30:30,374 --> 00:30:32,418
Just come on and help me.

203
00:30:32,543 --> 00:30:34,211
I'm coming.

204
00:30:40,259 --> 00:30:42,428
- Hey.
- The review.

205
00:30:43,303 --> 00:30:46,390
- They hated it. They hated me.
- Well, they can't hate you.

206
00:30:46,515 --> 00:30:48,892
"The young Miss Watson
is a pretty girl...

207
00:30:49,017 --> 00:30:51,186
easy on the eyes,
but not on the ears.

208
00:30:51,311 --> 00:30:53,605
Her small voice didn't carry
past the first row."

209
00:30:53,731 --> 00:30:55,899
That's ridiculous, I was right there.

210
00:30:55,983 --> 00:30:57,568
You were in the first row.

211
00:30:57,776 --> 00:31:01,113
Yeah, this... Listen, you were great.

212
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:05,784
That's a critic. This is something
you're gonna have to get used to.

213
00:31:05,826 --> 00:31:09,455
Believe me, I know.
Spider-Man gets attacked all the time.

214
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:13,625
This isn't about you. This is about me.
It's about my career.

215
00:31:13,751 --> 00:31:17,254
I know, and I'm just saying
you can't let it bring you down.

216
00:31:17,379 --> 00:31:20,090
You gotta believe in yourself
and pull yourself together.

217
00:31:20,174 --> 00:31:21,967
You get right back
on the horse and...

218
00:31:22,176 --> 00:31:24,053
Don't give me the horse thing.

219
00:31:24,178 --> 00:31:26,638
Try and understand how I feel.

220
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,228
It's just...

221
00:31:36,148 --> 00:31:38,233
I look at these words...

222
00:31:39,193 --> 00:31:41,570
and it's like my father wrote them.

223
00:31:42,613 --> 00:31:46,991
All cars. All cars in the vicinity of
54th and Sixth Avenue, please report.

224
00:31:46,992 --> 00:31:49,703
Crane out of control,
approach with caution.

225
00:31:52,956 --> 00:31:54,708
"Go get them, tiger"?

226
00:31:56,877 --> 00:31:58,545
I'm sorry.

227
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,123
Oh, my God. 7-Adam to Central.

228
00:32:34,248 --> 00:32:37,126
That crane job you sent us on?
It's bigger than we thought.

229
00:32:37,251 --> 00:32:40,587
We're gonna need
a major mobilization right away.

230
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:50,389
Shut it down at the generator. Now!

231
00:32:53,726 --> 00:32:57,146
Okay, Gwen, I've got a secret:
It's my copier.

232
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:03,110
What is that thing
doing in my background?

233
00:33:28,761 --> 00:33:31,472
They got some kind of short.
Can't shut down the crane.

234
00:33:31,555 --> 00:33:34,475
Get Edison on the phone.
Kill the power to the whole block.

235
00:33:38,145 --> 00:33:39,188
Are you all right?

236
00:33:39,396 --> 00:33:41,065
It's coming back.

237
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,193
Oh, no.

238
00:34:07,966 --> 00:34:10,886
- Oh, my God. That's Gwen.
- What?

239
00:34:16,016 --> 00:34:17,434
What's she doing up there?

240
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:20,478
I just saw her last night.
She said she had a modeling gig.

241
00:34:20,479 --> 00:34:23,607
- Who are you?
- It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock Jr.

242
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:25,484
And I work at the Daily Bugle.

243
00:34:26,193 --> 00:34:28,612
And I'm dating your daughter.

244
00:35:23,876 --> 00:35:25,210
You okay?

245
00:35:25,335 --> 00:35:27,838
Yeah, I'm fine.

246
00:35:28,047 --> 00:35:29,089
Thank you.

247
00:35:29,173 --> 00:35:31,592
Hey, Spidey, hold on.
Bugle needs a photo.

248
00:35:31,675 --> 00:35:33,552
- Thank God you're okay.
- Daddy.

249
00:35:33,677 --> 00:35:35,637
Hey. I'm the new guy.

250
00:35:35,763 --> 00:35:37,014
New guy?

251
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:39,600
You okay?

252
00:35:39,725 --> 00:35:42,852
From now on, I am gonna be
taking shots of you for the Bugle.

253
00:35:42,853 --> 00:35:45,773
So smile. Are you smiling?
Just kidding.

254
00:35:45,856 --> 00:35:48,358
- They got a guy.
- Who, Parker?

255
00:35:48,776 --> 00:35:53,071
Yeah, look, just between you and me,
guy's kind of an amateur.

256
00:35:53,072 --> 00:35:55,866
Have you noticed his stuff
makes you look a little bloated?

257
00:35:55,991 --> 00:35:58,369
Just... Yeah, a little chunky.

258
00:35:58,702 --> 00:36:00,371
Okay.

259
00:36:00,996 --> 00:36:03,499
But you don't have to worry about that
anymore, buddy.

260
00:36:12,341 --> 00:36:13,300
Dazzle me.

261
00:36:21,016 --> 00:36:24,019
Just something the boys in
the Ad Department and I whipped up.

262
00:36:24,144 --> 00:36:27,063
As you know, circulation at the Bugle's
been pretty good.

263
00:36:27,064 --> 00:36:29,024
Though not as good
as The New York Times.

264
00:36:29,149 --> 00:36:32,068
Or the Daily News, or the Post,
or several other smaller...

265
00:36:32,069 --> 00:36:34,154
Get on with it, you moron...!

266
00:36:34,363 --> 00:36:36,240
- What?
- Your blood pressure, Mr. Jameson.

267
00:36:36,323 --> 00:36:39,660
- Your wife told you to watch the anger.
- You tell my wife...

268
00:36:43,122 --> 00:36:44,998
Thank you.

269
00:36:46,875 --> 00:36:49,878
So I propose this campaign.

270
00:36:50,129 --> 00:36:52,589
"Daily Bugle. " That's obvious.

271
00:36:52,715 --> 00:36:55,926
"It's hip, it's now."
I came up with that one.

272
00:36:56,677 --> 00:36:59,471
"It's wow." That's actually Erickson.
He goes crazy.

273
00:36:59,596 --> 00:37:01,890
We gave him a couple lattes,
it's like:

274
00:37:02,182 --> 00:37:05,102
"And how." That's me again.

275
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:07,312
Time to take your pill.

276
00:37:08,564 --> 00:37:10,232
Not that one.

277
00:37:10,983 --> 00:37:12,735
Not that one.

278
00:37:20,868 --> 00:37:23,245
Drink plenty of water.

279
00:37:27,124 --> 00:37:28,584
Thank you.

280
00:37:30,961 --> 00:37:31,920
Continue.

281
00:37:35,466 --> 00:37:38,177
- He's busy.
- I'm just here to talk to you, beautiful.

282
00:37:38,302 --> 00:37:39,845
What's that smell?

283
00:37:39,928 --> 00:37:43,390
That's a little something called
Nice and Easy. What's on you?

284
00:37:43,474 --> 00:37:45,142
It's called Go Away.

285
00:37:45,267 --> 00:37:47,227
That is the dumbest idea
you've ever had...

286
00:37:47,352 --> 00:37:50,481
and you have had some doozies.
- Blood pressure.

287
00:37:50,689 --> 00:37:52,441
Hey, where are you going?

288
00:37:54,151 --> 00:37:56,737
- Who are you?
- You hired him last week. Freelance.

289
00:37:56,945 --> 00:37:59,864
- I did? What's that smell?
- It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock Jr.

290
00:37:59,865 --> 00:38:03,285
Can I just say I really like that shirt?
It's the crane accident.

291
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:05,371
- Check out the light.
- He likes my shirt.

292
00:38:05,496 --> 00:38:06,622
- Hey, Betty.
- Hey, Pete.

293
00:38:06,747 --> 00:38:08,624
You better get in there. New guy.

294
00:38:08,749 --> 00:38:11,627
He's trying to sell
some Spidey photos.

295
00:38:13,087 --> 00:38:14,671
Thanks.

296
00:38:14,755 --> 00:38:17,800
Parker. You're late, maybe too late.
Bruckner beat you to it.

297
00:38:17,925 --> 00:38:19,551
It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock Jr.

298
00:38:19,676 --> 00:38:22,054
- But I got you this.
- But he got me this.

299
00:38:22,179 --> 00:38:24,556
I didn't see you there.
How'd you get that high?

300
00:38:24,681 --> 00:38:27,601
- Climbed. Nearly fell off a flagpole.
- A flagpole?

301
00:38:27,684 --> 00:38:30,728
- Which one do we use?
- I like Bernstein's.

302
00:38:30,729 --> 00:38:31,980
- It's better.
- Cheaper too.

303
00:38:32,189 --> 00:38:34,900
Congratulations, we'll use yours.
I'll pay you 50 bucks.

304
00:38:35,025 --> 00:38:36,443
All right, J. J., I'm your man.

305
00:38:36,568 --> 00:38:39,363
I know more about a good picture
than any photographer.

306
00:38:39,488 --> 00:38:43,325
See, photography, it's not just about,
no offense, flagpoles or whatever.

307
00:38:43,367 --> 00:38:45,619
It's about lighting.
Composition. Drama.

308
00:38:46,453 --> 00:38:47,913
I want a staff job, sir.

309
00:38:48,038 --> 00:38:51,250
I have a girl that I intend to marry...

310
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:54,378
and I guess, I don't know,
I have this stupid little dream...

311
00:38:54,503 --> 00:38:58,132
of working with one of the greatest
newspaper editors of our time.

312
00:38:58,549 --> 00:38:59,925
J. Jonah Jameson.

313
00:39:03,345 --> 00:39:06,181
Well, we do have an opening.
Johnson quit, remember?

314
00:39:06,306 --> 00:39:07,516
- You fired him.
- Whatever.

315
00:39:07,641 --> 00:39:10,644
I know what makes a good picture
and I've been here a long time.

316
00:39:10,769 --> 00:39:12,855
If there's a staff job,
I think I deserve it.

317
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:16,900
He's right, Jonah. Peter's been with us
for years. He's done a great job.

318
00:39:17,025 --> 00:39:18,986
You want a staff job,
you want a staff job.

319
00:39:19,111 --> 00:39:20,988
- Anybody care about what I want?
- I do.

320
00:39:21,071 --> 00:39:22,948
Shut up. Get out.

321
00:39:23,073 --> 00:39:26,618
I want the public to see Spider-Man
for the two-bit criminal he really is.

322
00:39:26,744 --> 00:39:30,998
He's a fake, he's full of stickum.
Catch him in the act.

323
00:39:31,081 --> 00:39:33,375
Spider-Man with his hand
in a cookie jar.

324
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,586
Whoever brings me that photo
gets a job.

325
00:39:35,669 --> 00:39:37,546
What're you waiting for,
Chinese New Year?

326
00:39:37,671 --> 00:39:39,131
I'm on it, boss.

327
00:39:40,591 --> 00:39:41,925
You'll never get that shot.

328
00:39:42,051 --> 00:39:43,385
Oh, we'll see.

329
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:03,113
You know, I guess one person
can make a difference.

330
00:40:04,448 --> 00:40:06,241
Enough said.

331
00:40:11,455 --> 00:40:13,957
Welcome home, Harry.

332
00:40:14,792 --> 00:40:18,212
- Thank God you're all right.
- Thanks, Bernard.

333
00:40:18,337 --> 00:40:20,422
- Bernard.
- Sir.

334
00:40:22,383 --> 00:40:25,010
Got you a little homecoming present.

335
00:40:25,969 --> 00:40:27,721
- It's your old ball.
- Yeah.

336
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:28,972
Thanks, buddy.

337
00:40:29,807 --> 00:40:32,101
We were pretty good
in the backyard, weren't we?

338
00:40:32,226 --> 00:40:35,938
We were terrible.
And we tried out for the varsity team.

339
00:40:35,979 --> 00:40:38,023
- For the cheerleaders.
- Right.

340
00:40:38,232 --> 00:40:40,859
- Hey, do I have any girlfriends?
- I don't know.

341
00:40:40,984 --> 00:40:42,111
You don't?

342
00:40:42,736 --> 00:40:45,446
Hey, Bernard.
Do I have any girlfriends?

343
00:40:45,447 --> 00:40:48,033
Not that I know of, sir.

344
00:40:53,497 --> 00:40:55,124
It's a pretty cool pad, huh?

345
00:40:55,249 --> 00:40:57,000
It's okay.

346
00:40:57,126 --> 00:41:00,253
- Looks like I'm not hurting for money.
- No.

347
00:41:00,254 --> 00:41:04,091
Well, maybe I can turn this
no-girlfriend thing around.

348
00:41:11,515 --> 00:41:16,729
You know, he always appreciated how
you helped me through high school.

349
00:41:17,146 --> 00:41:19,857
Just wish I could remember
more about him.

350
00:41:21,316 --> 00:41:24,862
Well, he loved you.
That's the main thing.

351
00:41:25,904 --> 00:41:30,491
Hey, let's watch a game in the kitchen.
Get something to eat.

352
00:41:30,492 --> 00:41:31,618
Okay.

353
00:41:32,995 --> 00:41:34,121
Heads up.

354
00:41:37,791 --> 00:41:38,834
Did you see that?

355
00:41:39,543 --> 00:41:41,837
- Still got the moves.
- Yeah.

356
00:42:15,537 --> 00:42:16,580
Why are we stopping?

357
00:42:20,751 --> 00:42:21,794
What is she doing here?

358
00:42:22,002 --> 00:42:23,962
Well, Gary was supposed
to call her agent.

359
00:42:26,507 --> 00:42:29,176
Hi, honey. We tried to reach you.

360
00:42:29,301 --> 00:42:30,844
I'm sorry.

361
00:42:30,969 --> 00:42:32,096
One critic?

362
00:42:32,221 --> 00:42:33,472
No, all the papers, dear.

363
00:42:34,515 --> 00:42:37,017
Mary Jane, honey, sit down.
Let us explain it to you.

364
00:42:37,101 --> 00:42:39,812
Listen, if you'd like,
we could say you became ill.

365
00:42:50,656 --> 00:42:52,741
That was so poorly handled.

366
00:42:52,866 --> 00:42:54,326
Yeah.

367
00:42:54,827 --> 00:42:56,704
Let's just rehearse.

368
00:43:02,376 --> 00:43:04,753
All right, Spidey.

369
00:43:42,916 --> 00:43:45,002
Spidey! Spidey! Spidey!

370
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:48,838
Excuse me, miss? Could I please
see that gorgeous smile?

371
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:50,716
Hi, Eddie.

372
00:43:50,841 --> 00:43:54,053
You're so beautiful.
This is front-page stuff.

373
00:43:54,178 --> 00:43:55,721
I gotta practice. See you later.

374
00:43:55,846 --> 00:43:57,806
- How about tonight?
- Not tonight.

375
00:43:57,931 --> 00:43:59,391
Why not?

376
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:03,645
What about that amazing,
amazing night that we had?

377
00:44:04,605 --> 00:44:07,815
We had a coffee, Eddie.

378
00:44:07,816 --> 00:44:09,610
Hey, beautiful.

379
00:44:10,235 --> 00:44:11,695
One more.

380
00:44:14,948 --> 00:44:17,409
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

381
00:44:17,534 --> 00:44:21,789
- You're not still mad at me, are you?
- No, Peter, I'm proud of you.

382
00:44:21,914 --> 00:44:23,999
Hey, I'm gonna be swinging in
from over there.

383
00:44:24,124 --> 00:44:26,293
- Oh, yeah?
- So you know where to look.

384
00:44:27,753 --> 00:44:29,088
Give them a good show.

385
00:44:29,963 --> 00:44:31,382
Don't worry about that review.

386
00:44:31,507 --> 00:44:35,052
We're gonna be laughing about it
tomorrow night, I promise.

387
00:44:35,177 --> 00:44:36,720
Yeah.

388
00:44:53,404 --> 00:44:56,198
Isn't that that guy
from that prison break?

389
00:44:56,323 --> 00:44:57,783
He fits.

390
00:44:57,991 --> 00:45:00,577
Hey, you. Halt.

391
00:45:01,328 --> 00:45:02,996
Cover the back.

392
00:45:06,458 --> 00:45:08,502
Hon, be careful.

393
00:45:57,009 --> 00:45:58,135
He's in the truck.

394
00:45:58,385 --> 00:46:00,345
Round the front.

395
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,943
Fire.

396
00:46:39,009 --> 00:46:40,594
People of the city of New York...

397
00:46:40,803 --> 00:46:44,348
I am here today
because I fell 62 stories...

398
00:46:44,431 --> 00:46:46,016
and someone caught me.

399
00:46:46,225 --> 00:46:49,228
Someone who never asks
for anything in return.

400
00:46:49,353 --> 00:46:53,190
Someone who doesn't even want us
to know who he is.

401
00:46:53,315 --> 00:46:54,358
Hey, M. J.

402
00:46:54,441 --> 00:46:56,860
- Harry.
- Hey.

403
00:46:56,944 --> 00:46:58,404
Where's Pete?

404
00:46:59,279 --> 00:47:01,323
- Taking somebody's picture, I guess.
- Right.

405
00:47:01,448 --> 00:47:04,368
I'm so happy to see you.
You look so good, Harry.

406
00:47:04,451 --> 00:47:05,828
I've never felt better.

407
00:47:05,953 --> 00:47:08,122
It's a weird feeling
not knowing who you are.

408
00:47:08,205 --> 00:47:11,041
Bump on the head,
I'm as free as a bird.

409
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:13,544
Will you bump me on the head?

410
00:47:15,629 --> 00:47:17,923
Hey, Pete said you're in a play.

411
00:47:18,132 --> 00:47:20,843
You came. You sent me flowers.

412
00:47:20,968 --> 00:47:23,554
I did? I'll come again tonight.

413
00:47:24,054 --> 00:47:27,182
You can't. I was let go.

414
00:47:27,307 --> 00:47:29,184
What happened?

415
00:47:30,644 --> 00:47:32,187
I wasn't very good.

416
00:47:33,647 --> 00:47:35,733
You know, this is embarrassing...

417
00:47:35,858 --> 00:47:38,152
but I once wrote you a play
in high school.

418
00:47:38,235 --> 00:47:40,029
- You wrote me a play?
- Yeah.

419
00:47:40,154 --> 00:47:41,697
Harry, that's the sweetest thing.

420
00:47:41,905 --> 00:47:45,241
So I ask you: When you're dropping
without a parachute...

421
00:47:45,242 --> 00:47:48,787
or your store's being robbed
or your house is on fire...

422
00:47:48,912 --> 00:47:50,956
who is it that breaks your fall...

423
00:47:51,081 --> 00:47:54,835
puts out the flames
and saves your children?

424
00:47:54,918 --> 00:47:56,587
Spider-Man.

425
00:47:56,712 --> 00:47:57,963
They love me.

426
00:47:58,088 --> 00:48:01,507
Then let's hear it
for your one and only...

427
00:48:01,508 --> 00:48:06,096
friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man.

428
00:48:18,108 --> 00:48:21,403
Hey. What's up? All right.
How you doing?

429
00:48:22,863 --> 00:48:24,865
Shazam!

430
00:48:26,867 --> 00:48:27,868
Hey, guys.

431
00:48:28,118 --> 00:48:29,745
Spider-Man. Spider-Man.

432
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:32,039
Hey there. Hi.

433
00:48:33,832 --> 00:48:35,167
- Kiss him.
- Kiss him.

434
00:48:35,292 --> 00:48:38,212
Kiss him. Kiss him. Kiss him.

435
00:48:39,129 --> 00:48:40,714
Go ahead, lay one on me.

436
00:48:40,798 --> 00:48:42,591
- Really?
- Yeah, they'll love it.

437
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,343
- Kiss her.
- Kiss him.

438
00:48:44,468 --> 00:48:45,719
No, Spider-Man, no.

439
00:48:45,803 --> 00:48:47,805
All right.

440
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,274
Hope Pete's getting a shot of this.

441
00:49:04,697 --> 00:49:06,782
Hey, hey, are you okay?

442
00:49:06,907 --> 00:49:08,242
Yeah, I'm fine.

443
00:49:54,121 --> 00:49:56,206
Hey, man,
we got something on the roof.

444
00:50:18,812 --> 00:50:19,980
Jig's up, pal.

445
00:50:20,814 --> 00:50:23,609
I don't wanna hurt you. Leave now.

446
00:50:23,734 --> 00:50:27,071
I guess you haven't heard.
I'm the sheriff around these parts.

447
00:50:27,154 --> 00:50:28,322
Okay.

448
00:51:06,902 --> 00:51:08,362
Help!

449
00:51:42,896 --> 00:51:45,482
Where do all these guys come from?

450
00:52:38,869 --> 00:52:40,329
I'm sorry, I don't speak...

451
00:52:40,454 --> 00:52:43,874
But this is a French restaurant, non?

452
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:49,797
- Name, please?
- Parker, Peter.

453
00:52:53,675 --> 00:52:54,927
Here we are.

454
00:52:55,135 --> 00:52:57,304
Table for two. Parker.

455
00:52:58,472 --> 00:53:02,643
- Parker.
- That is what I said: Parker.

456
00:53:05,562 --> 00:53:06,897
I have a request.

457
00:53:07,022 --> 00:53:11,610
My girlfriend will be coming
and I have this ring.

458
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:18,367
Hello.

459
00:53:18,492 --> 00:53:21,412
Oh, so you want to
pop the question tonight, huh?

460
00:53:21,495 --> 00:53:24,415
Yes, and I wanna do something
very special.

461
00:53:24,665 --> 00:53:27,126
I love it. Romance.

462
00:53:27,251 --> 00:53:28,794
I am French.

463
00:53:30,796 --> 00:53:34,341
When I signal you, if you'd bring some
champagne with the ring...

464
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:36,927
- In the bottom of her glass?
- Perfect.

465
00:53:37,886 --> 00:53:40,180
Also, I thought at the same time...

466
00:53:40,264 --> 00:53:43,934
if the musicians
would play this song...

467
00:53:44,852 --> 00:53:47,062
Their favorite.

468
00:53:47,271 --> 00:53:49,773
And take good care of the ring.

469
00:53:49,982 --> 00:53:52,568
Oui, with my life, monsieur.

470
00:53:55,529 --> 00:53:57,156
I like you.

471
00:54:00,284 --> 00:54:01,869
Thank you.

472
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:15,299
Okay, so...

473
00:54:15,841 --> 00:54:18,218
Oh, would you like
some champagne?

474
00:54:21,889 --> 00:54:23,974
How'd that get in there?

475
00:54:25,225 --> 00:54:27,519
Oh, don't cry.

476
00:54:32,524 --> 00:54:33,650
Hi.

477
00:54:34,735 --> 00:54:36,779
Look at you. Wow, beautiful.

478
00:54:36,904 --> 00:54:38,447
Thanks.

479
00:54:42,743 --> 00:54:44,411
This place in your budget?

480
00:54:44,495 --> 00:54:46,705
Oh, well, it's a special occasion.

481
00:54:47,414 --> 00:54:48,999
You're on Broadway.

482
00:54:50,334 --> 00:54:52,336
I don't feel like
much of a star tonight.

483
00:54:52,419 --> 00:54:55,881
Well, you are a star.
And you've earned it.

484
00:54:56,298 --> 00:54:57,549
Peter...

485
00:54:59,009 --> 00:55:01,095
you have no idea
how I feel right now.

486
00:55:01,178 --> 00:55:04,306
Oh, no, I know exactly how you feel.

487
00:55:04,848 --> 00:55:09,311
Listen, I have been through this.
It happens to me all the time.

488
00:55:09,353 --> 00:55:11,313
I see Spider-Man posters
in the window...

489
00:55:11,438 --> 00:55:13,816
kids running around
with me on their sweaters...

490
00:55:13,941 --> 00:55:15,567
Big Halloween item.

491
00:55:15,693 --> 00:55:18,612
I don't know, I guess I've become
something of an icon.

492
00:55:18,696 --> 00:55:23,617
Like yesterday, they kept screaming,
"Spider-Man, Spider-Man."

493
00:55:24,368 --> 00:55:27,787
I don't know, you know, I mean,
I'm thinking to myself:

494
00:55:27,788 --> 00:55:31,834
"I'm just a nerdy kid from Queens.
Do I deserve this?"

495
00:55:33,961 --> 00:55:35,170
Hi, Pete.

496
00:55:35,629 --> 00:55:36,630
Hi.

497
00:55:44,471 --> 00:55:47,598
Hi, my parents and I
were just having dinner here.

498
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:50,310
- Hello. I'm Gwen Stacy.
- Hi.

499
00:55:50,519 --> 00:55:52,896
This is Mary Jane Watson.

500
00:55:54,273 --> 00:55:58,444
Oh, it's so nice to finally meet you.
Pete talks about you all the time.

501
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:04,490
Gwen is my lab partner
in Dr. Connors' class.

502
00:56:04,491 --> 00:56:07,827
Pete's something of a genius.
I'd be completely lost without him.

503
00:56:07,828 --> 00:56:09,788
Which actually reminds me...

504
00:56:09,913 --> 00:56:13,125
Pete, if you've got a picture
of my kiss with Spider-Man...

505
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:15,544
could you bring it to class?

506
00:56:15,669 --> 00:56:20,006
I'd really love it. For my portfolio.

507
00:56:20,007 --> 00:56:23,052
After all,
who gets kissed by Spider-Man, right?

508
00:56:23,677 --> 00:56:25,554
I can't imagine.

509
00:56:26,597 --> 00:56:29,391
Well, it was lovely to meet you.

510
00:56:30,267 --> 00:56:31,810
- Good night.
- Good night.

511
00:56:43,072 --> 00:56:44,948
Oh, she's in my science class.

512
00:56:45,157 --> 00:56:47,117
It's not her best subject.

513
00:56:49,536 --> 00:56:50,579
What?

514
00:56:50,788 --> 00:56:53,082
How come
you never mentioned her?

515
00:56:54,458 --> 00:56:56,919
She's your lab partner?

516
00:56:57,044 --> 00:56:59,213
You saved her life?

517
00:56:59,338 --> 00:57:00,672
She thinks you're a genius...

518
00:57:00,798 --> 00:57:04,218
and she had her
polished fingernails all over you?

519
00:57:04,343 --> 00:57:05,886
Or didn't you notice?

520
00:57:07,471 --> 00:57:10,599
And she gave Spider-Man
the key to the city.

521
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:13,936
I'll never forget that.

522
00:57:17,481 --> 00:57:18,941
She's just a girl in my class.

523
00:57:19,149 --> 00:57:20,901
Let me ask you something.

524
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:23,112
When you kissed her...

525
00:57:23,237 --> 00:57:25,698
who was kissing her?

526
00:57:25,823 --> 00:57:28,617
Spider-Man or Peter?

527
00:57:28,742 --> 00:57:31,745
- What do you mean?
- You know exactly what I mean.

528
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:34,164
That was our kiss.

529
00:57:34,248 --> 00:57:35,833
Why would you do that?

530
00:57:36,667 --> 00:57:40,003
You must have known
how it'd make me feel.

531
00:57:40,337 --> 00:57:43,966
- Do you wanna push me away?
- Push you away?

532
00:57:44,091 --> 00:57:46,676
Why would I wanna push you away?
I love you.

533
00:57:46,677 --> 00:57:50,848
You're my girlfriend.
She's a girl in my class, M. J.

534
00:57:52,182 --> 00:57:54,393
I don't feel well.
I'm sorry, I have to go.

535
00:57:54,518 --> 00:57:55,519
No, w...

536
00:57:57,187 --> 00:58:00,232
- Where are you going?
- Please, don't follow me.

537
00:58:03,444 --> 00:58:05,029
Here we are.

538
00:58:41,398 --> 00:58:44,526
Hi, it's M. J.
Sing your song at the beep.

539
00:58:45,903 --> 00:58:47,363
Hello.

540
00:58:50,074 --> 00:58:53,827
I wish you'd pick up the phone.
I don't know what's going on or...

541
00:58:53,911 --> 00:58:56,955
I don't know if you
got the messages or what.

542
00:58:57,373 --> 00:58:58,499
But...

543
00:58:59,875 --> 00:59:02,586
I just wanna talk to you.

544
00:59:03,837 --> 00:59:06,215
Okay, call me. Bye.

545
00:59:17,518 --> 00:59:19,061
- Hello?
- Mr. Parker?

546
00:59:19,269 --> 00:59:20,312
Yeah?

547
00:59:20,521 --> 00:59:23,023
This is Detective Neil Garrett
from the 32nd Precinct.

548
00:59:23,107 --> 00:59:24,983
I'm calling on behalf
of Captain Stacy.

549
00:59:25,109 --> 00:59:27,611
He would like you
to come down to the station.

550
00:59:27,695 --> 00:59:31,240
Originally, we thought that this man,
Dennis Carradine...

551
00:59:31,365 --> 00:59:33,325
was your husband's killer.

552
00:59:33,659 --> 00:59:35,327
We were wrong.

553
00:59:35,869 --> 00:59:36,870
What?

554
00:59:36,995 --> 00:59:39,915
Turns out Mr. Carradine
was only an accomplice.

555
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,501
The actual killer is still at large.

556
00:59:42,626 --> 00:59:44,378
What are you talking about?

557
00:59:44,503 --> 00:59:47,005
This is the man
who killed your husband.

558
00:59:51,802 --> 00:59:53,053
His name is Flint Marko.

559
00:59:53,262 --> 00:59:56,389
He's a small-time crook
who's been in and out of prison.

560
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:57,850
You got this wrong.

561
00:59:58,058 --> 00:59:59,309
Two days ago he escaped.

562
01:00:00,144 --> 01:00:02,854
Evidently, he confessed his guilt
to a cellmate...

563
01:00:02,855 --> 01:00:06,817
and we have a couple of witnesses
who will corroborate the story.

564
01:00:18,912 --> 01:00:21,498
No, wait, son.
You don't wanna do this.

565
01:00:24,752 --> 01:00:26,003
No!

566
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:37,681
Hey, get in! What are you doing?

567
01:00:56,450 --> 01:00:58,327
Would you put these photos away,
please?

568
01:00:58,535 --> 01:01:00,913
I'm sorry, Mrs. Parker.
I know this isn't easy...

569
01:01:01,038 --> 01:01:03,540
but, please, be patient with us.

570
01:01:03,624 --> 01:01:05,501
We're doing our job.
We will catch him.

571
01:01:05,626 --> 01:01:07,294
No, you're not doing your job.

572
01:01:07,378 --> 01:01:10,297
I watched my uncle die,
and we chased down the wrong man.

573
01:01:10,422 --> 01:01:13,550
Now you're telling me you had
suspicions for two years? Witnesses?

574
01:01:13,634 --> 01:01:15,844
- Why weren't we told about this?
- Settle down.

575
01:01:16,053 --> 01:01:17,721
I have no intention of settling down.

576
01:01:17,930 --> 01:01:20,516
This man killed my uncle,
and he's still out there!

577
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:30,943
L-20 Parkway.

578
01:01:31,068 --> 01:01:33,570
All officers in the vicinity,
please report.

579
01:01:33,904 --> 01:01:35,447
We have an abandoned vehicle...

580
01:01:35,656 --> 01:01:37,950
and an elderly man
in the middle of the street.

581
01:01:38,075 --> 01:01:40,452
Sorry, Wabash Avenue.

582
01:01:43,372 --> 01:01:44,623
Peter, it's M. J.

583
01:01:45,999 --> 01:01:48,043
I'm not here about
what happened at dinner.

584
01:01:48,252 --> 01:01:49,420
Just please open up.

585
01:01:57,010 --> 01:01:59,637
Aunt May called me.
She told me about what happened.

586
01:01:59,638 --> 01:02:01,306
She's worried about you.

587
01:02:02,141 --> 01:02:03,600
I'm worried about you.

588
01:02:03,684 --> 01:02:05,144
Don't be. I'm fine.

589
01:02:05,769 --> 01:02:07,771
I don't want you
to do something stupid.

590
01:02:07,855 --> 01:02:10,357
Like try to find my uncle's killer?

591
01:02:10,482 --> 01:02:12,985
And do something you'll regret.

592
01:02:13,110 --> 01:02:16,113
Like with that other guy.

593
01:02:16,739 --> 01:02:19,950
He had a gun on me. I made a move
and he fell. I told you that.

594
01:02:20,075 --> 01:02:23,287
- I'm not accusing you of anything.
- 10-22, auto at 556...

595
01:02:23,537 --> 01:02:27,582
- Will you turn that thing off?
- Crossing 5-6 to 5-7.

596
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:32,587
Yeah, Central, this is Car 3-9
responding to your Sixth Avenue call.

597
01:02:32,588 --> 01:02:36,008
Peter, I'm here
because I care about you.

598
01:02:36,133 --> 01:02:39,762
And I know that you made a mistake
and that you feel guilty...

599
01:02:39,803 --> 01:02:43,431
but I wanna be here for you.

600
01:02:43,432 --> 01:02:46,768
Okay. I get it. Thank you.

601
01:02:46,769 --> 01:02:49,480
But I'm fine. I...

602
01:02:49,563 --> 01:02:51,440
I don't need your help.

603
01:02:58,864 --> 01:03:01,784
Everybody needs help sometimes,
Peter.

604
01:03:01,909 --> 01:03:03,744
Even Spider-Man.

605
01:03:12,002 --> 01:03:14,713
Ninety X-ray, 98.

606
01:03:16,382 --> 01:03:21,260
Two-four King, respond to 1031
at 642 Madison Ave.

607
01:03:21,261 --> 01:03:26,391
One-three Thomas, respond to 1020
at 540 East 107.

608
01:03:26,392 --> 01:03:30,354
Male complainant inside apartment.
May be on first floor.

609
01:03:33,691 --> 01:03:37,653
Three Henry 10- 11,
I have a residence. 73818...

610
01:04:37,921 --> 01:04:39,673
Don't hurt me.
Just give me a chance!

611
01:04:39,798 --> 01:04:42,801
What about my uncle?
Did you give him a chance?

612
01:04:42,926 --> 01:04:44,053
Did you?

613
01:04:56,190 --> 01:04:58,025
Where am I?

614
01:05:14,291 --> 01:05:15,959
What is this?

615
01:05:18,170 --> 01:05:19,838
I feel...

616
01:05:24,426 --> 01:05:26,720
This feels good.

617
01:05:38,732 --> 01:05:40,484
Yeah!

618
01:05:56,667 --> 01:05:58,293
This is something else.

619
01:06:00,421 --> 01:06:01,630
What do you think?

620
01:06:01,755 --> 01:06:03,924
I've never seen anything like it.

621
01:06:04,049 --> 01:06:05,926
I'm a physicist, not a biologist...

622
01:06:06,135 --> 01:06:08,929
but let me look at it in the morning.
Run some tests.

623
01:06:09,054 --> 01:06:10,097
Can we do that now?

624
01:06:15,102 --> 01:06:17,396
It seems to like you.

625
01:06:19,773 --> 01:06:22,484
- Don't let any of that get on you.
- Why not?

626
01:06:22,609 --> 01:06:25,195
It has the characteristics
of a symbiote...

627
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:28,532
which needs to bond
to a host to survive.

628
01:06:28,657 --> 01:06:32,410
And sometimes these things in nature,
when they bind...

629
01:06:32,411 --> 01:06:34,913
they can be hard to unbind.

630
01:06:36,165 --> 01:06:40,127
Bank robbery in progress,
First Eastern Bank at 202 Bismark.

631
01:06:40,210 --> 01:06:42,837
Another sandstorm
is reported in the vicinity.

632
01:06:42,838 --> 01:06:45,966
- All cars proceed with caution.
- Marko.

633
01:07:40,938 --> 01:07:43,315
Buddy, love the new outfit.

634
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,484
This is exactly what I need
to scoop Parker.

635
01:07:45,609 --> 01:07:47,486
Give some of that web action.

636
01:07:49,154 --> 01:07:51,323
See you, chump.

637
01:07:52,908 --> 01:07:54,660
What the hell?

638
01:08:36,994 --> 01:08:38,162
Flint Marko.

639
01:08:40,998 --> 01:08:44,001
- What do you want from me?
- Remember Ben Parker?

640
01:08:44,626 --> 01:08:47,755
The old man you shot down
in cold blood?

641
01:08:49,214 --> 01:08:50,883
What does it matter to you, anyway?

642
01:08:52,676 --> 01:08:54,094
Everything!

643
01:09:31,757 --> 01:09:34,134
It's time to pay, Marko!

644
01:10:44,121 --> 01:10:46,206
Good riddance.

645
01:11:06,977 --> 01:11:09,646
- Rent.
- Not now.

646
01:11:09,980 --> 01:11:12,691
Listen, it's a free country.
It's not rent-free country.

647
01:11:13,108 --> 01:11:15,069
- Leave me alone.
- Give me rent.

648
01:11:15,194 --> 01:11:18,197
You'll get your rent
when you fix this damn door!

649
01:11:29,249 --> 01:11:31,251
That wasn't cool.

650
01:11:31,543 --> 01:11:35,714
He is a good boy.

651
01:11:37,424 --> 01:11:39,385
He must be in some kind of trouble.

652
01:12:27,349 --> 01:12:30,769
Flint Marko,
the man who killed Uncle Ben...

653
01:12:31,645 --> 01:12:34,106
he was killed last night.

654
01:12:34,231 --> 01:12:35,691
Oh, my.

655
01:12:36,525 --> 01:12:37,443
What happened?

656
01:12:38,193 --> 01:12:39,653
Spider-Man killed him.

657
01:12:41,530 --> 01:12:42,656
Spider-Man?

658
01:12:43,615 --> 01:12:45,701
I don't understand.

659
01:12:45,826 --> 01:12:48,620
Spider-Man doesn't kill people.

660
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:52,041
What happened?

661
01:12:54,668 --> 01:12:56,420
I...

662
01:12:57,254 --> 01:12:58,630
He...

663
01:12:59,256 --> 01:13:01,008
He was...

664
01:13:05,095 --> 01:13:08,098
I thought that you'd feel...

665
01:13:10,517 --> 01:13:12,478
He deserved it, didn't he?

666
01:13:13,228 --> 01:13:14,897
I don't think it's for us to say...

667
01:13:15,105 --> 01:13:19,276
whether a person deserves
to live or die.

668
01:13:19,693 --> 01:13:22,488
But, Aunt May, he killed Uncle Ben.

669
01:13:22,613 --> 01:13:25,115
Uncle Ben meant the world to us.

670
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:28,744
But he wouldn't want us living
one second...

671
01:13:28,869 --> 01:13:31,580
with revenge in our hearts.

672
01:13:33,999 --> 01:13:36,460
It's like a poison. It can...

673
01:13:37,211 --> 01:13:39,296
It can take you over.

674
01:13:41,173 --> 01:13:46,387
Before you know it,
turn us into something ugly.

675
01:14:00,150 --> 01:14:02,945
- He said it was a good idea.
- Yeah.

676
01:14:47,906 --> 01:14:49,033
Hello?

677
01:14:49,158 --> 01:14:50,701
Hey, Harry, it's M. J.

678
01:14:50,826 --> 01:14:52,077
Hi.

679
01:14:52,202 --> 01:14:53,620
I need some company.

680
01:14:53,746 --> 01:14:56,248
Are you doing anything?
Can I stop by?

681
01:14:56,373 --> 01:14:58,417
Yeah, sure, come on over.

682
01:14:58,542 --> 01:15:00,919
Okay. Are you sure it's okay?

683
01:15:01,045 --> 01:15:03,630
No, I'm not doing anything.
Please, come over.

684
01:15:03,881 --> 01:15:06,550
- Okay, I'll see you soon.
- Great.

685
01:15:06,675 --> 01:15:08,135
Bye.

686
01:15:09,053 --> 01:15:11,346
- Bernard.
- Yes, Mr. Osborn?

687
01:15:11,472 --> 01:15:13,766
We're having a guest.
Can you get some food?

688
01:15:13,891 --> 01:15:16,060
- A guest?
- Yeah, a guest.

689
01:15:16,185 --> 01:15:19,688
- A "guest" guest?
- Will you just get some food?

690
01:15:19,813 --> 01:15:21,482
Right away, sir.

691
01:15:38,248 --> 01:15:41,293
Hey, Mr. Ditkovitch.

692
01:15:41,794 --> 01:15:44,713
- An orange?
- No, thanks.

693
01:15:44,838 --> 01:15:48,800
Listen, I'm really sorry
for what happened earlier.

694
01:15:48,801 --> 01:15:52,346
I shouldn't have yelled about that door.
It was nothing to be angry about.

695
01:15:52,429 --> 01:15:54,306
It's no big deal.

696
01:15:54,515 --> 01:15:58,686
But if you feel that bad about it,
you can buy me pizza sometime.

697
01:15:58,811 --> 01:16:01,939
- Today's good.
- Okay.

698
01:16:02,064 --> 01:16:04,858
- Have problem with the phone?
- No, no. I was just...

699
01:16:04,942 --> 01:16:07,027
Well, I was trying
to figure out what to say.

700
01:16:07,152 --> 01:16:10,988
If it's a woman you're calling,
then you say:

701
01:16:10,989 --> 01:16:14,535
"You're a good woman.
I am good man."

702
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:21,417
- Hi, Pete.
- Hi.

703
01:16:21,542 --> 01:16:22,793
He's calling a woman.

704
01:16:23,001 --> 01:16:24,878
Mary Jane?
I think that would be so good...

705
01:16:25,087 --> 01:16:29,133
This is none of your business.
Go. Go. Call.

706
01:16:30,718 --> 01:16:33,429
- You should call.
- Thanks.

707
01:16:35,806 --> 01:16:38,100
- Bye.
- Bye.

708
01:16:51,905 --> 01:16:53,032
Hi.

709
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:58,662
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

710
01:16:59,705 --> 01:17:01,165
Come on.

711
01:17:05,335 --> 01:17:07,713
- I hope you like peppers.
- I love them.

712
01:17:31,612 --> 01:17:33,489
No. Please.

713
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:46,835
Oh, the butter.

714
01:17:56,970 --> 01:17:58,597
Beautiful.

715
01:18:03,102 --> 01:18:04,853
Check this out.

716
01:18:11,944 --> 01:18:14,363
Well, we can use that part.

717
01:18:16,031 --> 01:18:18,117
You've been dreaming.

718
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:21,453
Nothing like a little self-deception
to get you through the night.

719
01:18:21,578 --> 01:18:24,456
- All right.
- When did you write that?

720
01:18:24,581 --> 01:18:27,500
- Twelfth grade.
- It's intense.

721
01:18:27,501 --> 01:18:31,338
- So you want the part?
- I'd love to be in your play.

722
01:18:31,463 --> 01:18:32,923
It's yours.

723
01:18:35,008 --> 01:18:38,554
You know, there's not even a scar.

724
01:18:40,014 --> 01:18:41,682
Barely.

725
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:00,659
- Sorry.
- Me too.

726
01:19:00,868 --> 01:19:05,039
- I didn't mean to do that.
- No, it's okay. Please, forgive me.

727
01:19:06,373 --> 01:19:08,042
Mary Jane.

728
01:19:08,792 --> 01:19:10,669
Mary Jane.

729
01:19:11,378 --> 01:19:14,214
- Mary Jane, please.
- I'm sorry.

730
01:19:14,506 --> 01:19:15,883
Just...

731
01:19:27,978 --> 01:19:31,523
You've taken your eye off the ball.

732
01:19:37,654 --> 01:19:39,114
Harry.

733
01:19:52,169 --> 01:19:53,420
What have you done?

734
01:19:56,131 --> 01:19:57,591
Avenge me!

735
01:20:00,844 --> 01:20:04,973
- My father, he died, right?
- Yeah.

736
01:20:05,015 --> 01:20:07,267
Just wish I could remember
more about him.

737
01:20:07,393 --> 01:20:10,521
Well, he loved you.
That's the main thing.

738
01:20:10,604 --> 01:20:13,857
I swear on my father's grave,
Spider-Man will pay.

739
01:20:14,608 --> 01:20:16,360
Harry.

740
01:20:18,028 --> 01:20:19,988
Remember me?

741
01:20:21,782 --> 01:20:24,909
Yes, Father. I remember.

742
01:20:24,910 --> 01:20:28,247
I was right about her. About Peter.

743
01:20:28,372 --> 01:20:30,624
About everything.

744
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,962
You know what you must do.
Make him suffer.

745
01:20:35,963 --> 01:20:38,340
Make him wish he were dead.

746
01:20:38,465 --> 01:20:42,511
First, we attack his heart.

747
01:20:52,521 --> 01:20:55,649
Hi, it's me.
Sing your song at the beep.

748
01:20:55,774 --> 01:20:58,694
Hey, M. J. It's Peter.

749
01:21:00,571 --> 01:21:03,490
I wanna talk to you about last night.

750
01:21:04,241 --> 01:21:06,410
I don't know what I was thinking.

751
01:21:06,535 --> 01:21:11,497
I know you were just there
to help and I...

752
01:21:11,498 --> 01:21:14,626
I don't know. I wanna see you.

753
01:21:19,048 --> 01:21:22,885
If you want Peter to live,
you're gonna do something for me.

754
01:21:27,056 --> 01:21:28,599
- Yeah?
- It's Ursula.

755
01:21:28,724 --> 01:21:30,476
Come in.

756
01:21:39,151 --> 01:21:40,903
- Hi, Pete.
- Hi.

757
01:21:41,028 --> 01:21:43,322
There's a phone call for you.

758
01:21:44,573 --> 01:21:46,241
It's Mary Jane, she called back.

759
01:21:46,533 --> 01:21:48,535
- Really?
- Yeah.

760
01:21:50,204 --> 01:21:55,834
- I put the phone on top of the thing.
- Thanks. Okay.

761
01:21:57,795 --> 01:21:59,380
- Hey.
- Hi.

762
01:21:59,588 --> 01:22:02,298
Oh, I'm so glad you called.
I've been trying to...

763
01:22:02,299 --> 01:22:05,219
- Can you meet me?
- You bet.

764
01:22:05,302 --> 01:22:07,805
- Now?
- Okay. Where?

765
01:22:07,930 --> 01:22:09,807
At the bridge in the park.

766
01:22:09,890 --> 01:22:11,266
- On my way.
- Okay.

767
01:22:11,475 --> 01:22:14,478
Okay. Hey. I love you.

768
01:22:33,789 --> 01:22:35,874
You look beautiful.

769
01:22:37,126 --> 01:22:38,669
Peonies.

770
01:22:41,088 --> 01:22:43,799
- You okay?
- No.

771
01:22:44,758 --> 01:22:46,802
There's something
I have to tell you, Pete.

772
01:22:47,344 --> 01:22:48,804
Okay.

773
01:22:50,055 --> 01:22:51,724
It's not working.

774
01:22:52,766 --> 01:22:54,435
You and me.

775
01:22:55,561 --> 01:22:56,937
What?

776
01:22:57,271 --> 01:22:59,648
I don't wanna see you anymore.

777
01:23:00,190 --> 01:23:02,026
What are you talking about?

778
01:23:02,151 --> 01:23:04,236
I don't know.

779
01:23:06,947 --> 01:23:08,699
I'm lonely.

780
01:23:09,950 --> 01:23:12,244
You aren't there for me.

781
01:23:13,287 --> 01:23:15,789
I can't do this.

782
01:23:15,914 --> 01:23:21,837
- It's over.
- No. Please. Please don't say that.

783
01:23:22,171 --> 01:23:25,089
I know I've been selfish,
but I can do better. I can change.

784
01:23:25,090 --> 01:23:28,927
- It's not that simple.
- We love each other. I love you.

785
01:23:29,053 --> 01:23:31,138
We have problems.
When people have problems...

786
01:23:31,347 --> 01:23:34,141
they work it out.
They talk to each other.

787
01:23:39,146 --> 01:23:40,939
Look, you see?

788
01:23:41,982 --> 01:23:44,068
You know what this is?

789
01:23:45,319 --> 01:23:48,530
- You know what I want for us?
- There's someone else.

790
01:23:48,655 --> 01:23:51,575
I've fallen in love
with someone else.

791
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:14,723
Bravo.

792
01:24:24,733 --> 01:24:29,196
She says that she's lonely,
that I'm not there for her.

793
01:24:30,572 --> 01:24:32,866
There's another guy.

794
01:24:35,786 --> 01:24:37,663
Well, how you holding up?

795
01:24:38,288 --> 01:24:40,040
Not good.

796
01:24:42,126 --> 01:24:45,045
Harry, I was gonna propose to her.

797
01:24:45,587 --> 01:24:47,256
Really?

798
01:24:49,466 --> 01:24:53,511
Well, she's been going through
a tough time lately. Career.

799
01:24:53,512 --> 01:24:56,432
I mean, a singing waitress
at a jazz club?

800
01:24:56,515 --> 01:24:59,643
It's not exactly
what she had in mind for herself.

801
01:24:59,768 --> 01:25:02,896
Singing waitress? What are you...?
What are you talking about?

802
01:25:02,980 --> 01:25:07,568
Well, she was fired from the show.
Didn't she tell you?

803
01:25:07,901 --> 01:25:09,236
She was fired?

804
01:25:10,904 --> 01:25:16,243
She was fired and she told you?
She didn't tell me?

805
01:25:17,703 --> 01:25:20,205
Well, that's why
I asked you here, Pete.

806
01:25:21,457 --> 01:25:23,542
I'm the other guy.

807
01:25:25,335 --> 01:25:27,087
What?

808
01:25:27,212 --> 01:25:30,215
Look, she came to me
one afternoon, troubled.

809
01:25:30,340 --> 01:25:33,344
She needed someone
and I was there for her.

810
01:25:34,178 --> 01:25:37,306
I've always loved her, Pete.
You know that.

811
01:25:37,431 --> 01:25:39,183
It just...

812
01:25:39,391 --> 01:25:41,477
started.

813
01:25:48,776 --> 01:25:52,112
I don't believe this.
I don't... I don't believe you.

814
01:25:52,237 --> 01:25:54,615
Look, I'm really sorry.

815
01:25:56,075 --> 01:25:58,452
I just thought you should know.

816
01:26:06,627 --> 01:26:10,130
- Can I warm you up?
- Yes, please.

817
01:26:11,715 --> 01:26:13,175
How's the pie?

818
01:26:14,218 --> 01:26:15,886
So good.

819
01:27:19,199 --> 01:27:21,035
Would you like a drink?

820
01:27:23,871 --> 01:27:26,373
I'm sorry. What was I thinking?

821
01:27:26,582 --> 01:27:29,292
Bad for the public image, right,
Mr. Key-to-the-City?

822
01:27:29,293 --> 01:27:30,544
What did you do to her?

823
01:27:32,713 --> 01:27:35,549
I did what you failed to do.
I was there for her.

824
01:27:36,383 --> 01:27:38,469
Mary Jane and I,
we understand each other.

825
01:27:38,594 --> 01:27:43,766
- She doesn't know what you are.
- Peter, she knows me very well.

826
01:27:43,807 --> 01:27:48,062
And when she kissed me,
it was just like she used to kiss me.

827
01:27:48,395 --> 01:27:50,147
That taste...

828
01:27:51,815 --> 01:27:53,067
Strawberries.

829
01:28:28,727 --> 01:28:30,270
How'd you like that, Spidey?

830
01:28:34,149 --> 01:28:35,401
That all you got?

831
01:28:42,700 --> 01:28:45,285
- Stings, doesn't it?
- I protected you in high school.

832
01:28:45,411 --> 01:28:47,705
Now I'm gonna kick your little ass.

833
01:29:34,918 --> 01:29:36,920
Gonna kill me
like you killed my father?

834
01:29:37,004 --> 01:29:39,214
I'm done trying to convince you.

835
01:29:40,049 --> 01:29:43,593
You took him from me. He loved me.

836
01:29:43,594 --> 01:29:47,639
No. He despised you.

837
01:29:47,765 --> 01:29:50,059
You were an embarrassment to him.

838
01:29:53,687 --> 01:29:57,649
Look at little Goblin Junior.
Gonna cry?

839
01:30:34,353 --> 01:30:36,647
Spider-Man used to
make me feel safe.

840
01:30:36,772 --> 01:30:38,856
Now I'm afraid
to walk home from work.

841
01:30:38,857 --> 01:30:42,611
- My son thought the world of this guy.
- I have a daughter, loves Spider-Man.

842
01:30:42,820 --> 01:30:46,156
- Who's she to look up to?
- This is the guy they gave the key to?

843
01:30:47,324 --> 01:30:50,202
I'm gonna put some dirt in your eye.

844
01:30:52,204 --> 01:30:55,416
- Cheers to the new staff photographer.
- Hey, I just got lucky.

845
01:30:55,541 --> 01:30:57,209
This is so wonderful for you.

846
01:30:57,418 --> 01:31:01,171
Well, you might wanna tell J. J.
To make a little more wall space.

847
01:31:06,176 --> 01:31:09,721
Wow, good morning.
It's a beautiful day, huh?

848
01:31:09,722 --> 01:31:12,307
What was it you said?
I'll never get that picture?

849
01:31:13,058 --> 01:31:14,810
There's your hero.

850
01:31:16,270 --> 01:31:19,939
- I never thought he'd really do that.
- See? Right there.

851
01:31:19,940 --> 01:31:22,651
You made a judgment call.
You gotta see it as it is.

852
01:31:22,776 --> 01:31:24,111
Funny you should say that...

853
01:31:24,319 --> 01:31:28,698
because I was looking through
some old photos and it looks very...

854
01:31:28,699 --> 01:31:30,576
similar.

855
01:31:31,702 --> 01:31:34,747
Okay. Well, I gotta get back to work.

856
01:31:35,789 --> 01:31:38,917
- You're trash, Brock.
- Excuse me?

857
01:31:39,043 --> 01:31:41,003
Your picture's a fake.

858
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:46,091
Oh, Parker,
you are such a boy scout.

859
01:31:46,216 --> 01:31:48,302
When are you gonna
give a guy a break?

860
01:31:50,304 --> 01:31:52,556
You want forgiveness? Get religion.

861
01:31:52,681 --> 01:31:56,310
- What's going on here?
- Are you guys all right?

862
01:31:59,355 --> 01:32:03,108
Yeah. No, we...
We're just horsing around.

863
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:07,570
Look, I'm begging you.
If you do this, I will lose everything.

864
01:32:07,571 --> 01:32:09,865
There's not a paper in town
that will hire me.

865
01:32:09,990 --> 01:32:12,368
You should've
thought of that earlier.

866
01:32:13,118 --> 01:32:15,412
What are you doing, Peter?

867
01:32:15,496 --> 01:32:19,875
Show this to your editor.
Tell him to check his source next time.

868
01:32:25,923 --> 01:32:27,508
It's a fake.

869
01:32:27,591 --> 01:32:31,762
Empire State
Photographic Department confirms it.

870
01:32:35,224 --> 01:32:37,184
Pack your things.
Get out of my building.

871
01:32:37,601 --> 01:32:39,812
- I was just trying...
- You're fired.

872
01:32:41,271 --> 01:32:43,649
We're gonna have to
print a retraction now.

873
01:32:43,774 --> 01:32:45,859
I haven't printed a retraction
in 20 years.

874
01:32:52,116 --> 01:32:54,702
- Hello.
- Mr. Parker, Dr. Connors here.

875
01:32:54,952 --> 01:32:59,205
Oh, Dr. Connors. How are you?

876
01:32:59,206 --> 01:33:02,418
Quite a specimen
you left me, Parker.

877
01:33:02,751 --> 01:33:07,547
Its chemistry is not unlike
the chondritic meteorites of the '70s.

878
01:33:07,548 --> 01:33:08,590
Thanks.

879
01:33:08,799 --> 01:33:11,385
- That's good.
- You know what, Parker?

880
01:33:13,303 --> 01:33:16,181
- Parker?
- Get me some milk.

881
01:33:16,932 --> 01:33:20,477
It amplifies characteristics
of its host.

882
01:33:20,561 --> 01:33:24,440
- Hey, give me another cookie.
- Especially aggression.

883
01:33:25,399 --> 01:33:27,234
This could be dangerous.

884
01:33:27,359 --> 01:33:31,112
Peter, you didn't keep any, did you?

885
01:33:31,113 --> 01:33:34,950
- You got any with nuts?
- I have some nuts. I could make some.

886
01:33:34,992 --> 01:33:36,618
- Go make me some.
- Peter?

887
01:33:36,744 --> 01:33:39,455
No, no, no. Course not.

888
01:33:53,844 --> 01:33:55,721
These shots are so good.

889
01:33:55,846 --> 01:33:58,432
I'd love to shoot you sometime.

890
01:33:58,849 --> 01:34:02,269
Peter Parker. Peter.

891
01:34:02,394 --> 01:34:06,856
Parker. Miss Brant, that's not
the position I hired you for.

892
01:34:06,857 --> 01:34:08,442
Black-suit Spider-Man.

893
01:34:09,902 --> 01:34:12,071
Peter, these are incredible.

894
01:34:12,196 --> 01:34:15,199
- We gotta have these, Jonah.
- I'll pay you the usual rate.

895
01:34:17,117 --> 01:34:19,787
If you want the shots,
I'll take the staff job...

896
01:34:19,912 --> 01:34:21,789
double the money.

897
01:35:46,790 --> 01:35:48,208
Penny.

898
01:35:54,298 --> 01:35:56,967
You are really gonna dig this joint.

899
01:35:58,344 --> 01:36:00,429
Do you think I'm...?
I'm dressed all right?

900
01:36:00,554 --> 01:36:02,097
Too fancy or too...

901
01:36:02,222 --> 01:36:06,352
Are you kidding me?
You're looking fine, babe.

902
01:36:06,393 --> 01:36:10,230
- Thank you.
- Love that little giggle.

903
01:36:12,941 --> 01:36:14,818
Hey, keep it open there, pops.

904
01:36:18,155 --> 01:36:21,700
Oh, this is so cool.

905
01:36:21,825 --> 01:36:24,495
I have never been
to a jazz club before.

906
01:36:27,331 --> 01:36:30,667
Oh, I hope we can get a table.

907
01:36:35,339 --> 01:36:37,841
Find us some shade.

908
01:36:38,926 --> 01:36:41,095
Thanks, hot legs.

909
01:36:41,428 --> 01:36:44,014
Right this way, sir.

910
01:36:51,438 --> 01:36:53,482
Oh, why, thank you.

911
01:36:58,696 --> 01:37:02,783
- I am so loving this.
- Oh, me too.

912
01:37:08,205 --> 01:37:11,749
- Isn't that your old girlfriend?
- Yeah.

913
01:37:11,750 --> 01:37:16,337
- Do you wanna go someplace else?
- Oh, no, no. I'll... I'll be okay.

914
01:37:16,338 --> 01:37:19,258
- Mary Jane, show us what you got.
- I'll take that.

915
01:37:24,888 --> 01:37:28,100
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

916
01:37:37,067 --> 01:37:38,235
Peter?

917
01:37:41,238 --> 01:37:43,323
This is for you.

918
01:37:48,871 --> 01:37:50,539
Double-time.

919
01:37:55,753 --> 01:37:57,421
Thanks.

920
01:38:24,114 --> 01:38:25,991
Now dig on this.

921
01:38:27,242 --> 01:38:28,369
That is hot.

922
01:39:09,576 --> 01:39:11,328
That was all for her?

923
01:39:20,004 --> 01:39:21,547
I'm so sorry.

924
01:39:33,976 --> 01:39:36,478
- You all right, Mary Jane?
- I'm fine.

925
01:39:36,603 --> 01:39:38,022
Okay.

926
01:39:40,941 --> 01:39:42,401
Hey.

927
01:39:44,611 --> 01:39:45,946
What's wrong with you?

928
01:39:47,114 --> 01:39:48,574
You.

929
01:39:49,116 --> 01:39:52,202
- Can I help you, sir?
- No.

930
01:39:52,327 --> 01:39:54,413
Is everything okay here, Paul?

931
01:39:54,621 --> 01:39:56,914
Yeah, is everything okay here, Paul?

932
01:39:56,915 --> 01:39:59,418
- Take him out of here.
- Let's go, sir.

933
01:39:59,543 --> 01:40:02,421
- Take your hand off of me.
- Now.

934
01:40:02,546 --> 01:40:06,091
- Okay.
- Hey, get off. Let go.

935
01:40:08,469 --> 01:40:10,137
Peter, stop it!

936
01:40:21,732 --> 01:40:23,192
Who are you?

937
01:40:25,569 --> 01:40:27,237
I don't know.

938
01:41:59,830 --> 01:42:01,707
It's Brock, sir.

939
01:42:01,832 --> 01:42:04,418
Edward Brock Jr.

940
01:42:06,086 --> 01:42:08,797
I come before you today...

941
01:42:10,174 --> 01:42:11,842
humbled...

942
01:42:13,719 --> 01:42:15,804
and humiliated...

943
01:42:18,724 --> 01:42:21,018
to ask you for one thing.

944
01:42:26,523 --> 01:42:28,400
I want you to kill Peter Parker.

945
01:43:19,410 --> 01:43:20,452
Parker.

946
01:45:04,515 --> 01:45:06,809
- Hi, Peter.
- Hi.

947
01:45:09,311 --> 01:45:13,691
You don't seem to have changed
the room around very much.

948
01:45:14,108 --> 01:45:18,487
Of course, there's not much
you could do, is there?

949
01:45:24,535 --> 01:45:26,829
When we spoke on the phone...

950
01:45:26,954 --> 01:45:29,415
I sensed that something
was bothering you...

951
01:45:30,165 --> 01:45:33,585
so I thought I'd just come by.

952
01:45:35,796 --> 01:45:38,382
How's Mary Jane?

953
01:45:38,716 --> 01:45:40,384
I don't know.

954
01:45:42,803 --> 01:45:45,389
I never heard from you.

955
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:48,100
Did you ever propose?

956
01:45:51,979 --> 01:45:53,731
You said...

957
01:45:54,648 --> 01:45:58,193
a husband's gotta put a wife
before himself.

958
01:46:03,323 --> 01:46:05,409
I'm not ready.

959
01:46:07,494 --> 01:46:09,788
But what happened?

960
01:46:10,497 --> 01:46:13,125
You seemed so sure.

961
01:46:14,376 --> 01:46:15,919
Yeah.

962
01:46:17,296 --> 01:46:18,964
I...

963
01:46:29,266 --> 01:46:31,685
I hurt her, Aunt May.

964
01:46:32,936 --> 01:46:35,022
I don't know what to do.

965
01:46:36,899 --> 01:46:40,652
Well, you start
by doing the hardest thing:

966
01:46:41,362 --> 01:46:44,490
You forgive yourself.

967
01:46:47,534 --> 01:46:50,037
I believe in you, Peter.

968
01:46:50,245 --> 01:46:53,165
You're a good person.

969
01:46:54,124 --> 01:46:59,088
And I know you will find a way
to put it right.

970
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:08,597
In time.

971
01:47:26,657 --> 01:47:29,034
End of the line, Spider-Man.

972
01:47:33,080 --> 01:47:35,499
I want him dead too, Flint.

973
01:47:35,916 --> 01:47:38,210
That's why
I've been looking for you.

974
01:47:38,335 --> 01:47:41,755
Oh, yeah. I know all about you.

975
01:47:41,839 --> 01:47:46,218
Like the fact that Spider-Man
won't let you help your poor daughter.

976
01:47:46,260 --> 01:47:49,555
It's just...
That doesn't seem right to me.

977
01:47:49,680 --> 01:47:54,892
Look, I wanna kill the spider,
you wanna kill the spider.

978
01:47:54,893 --> 01:47:58,230
Together, he doesn't stand a chance.

979
01:47:59,189 --> 01:48:01,233
Interested?

980
01:48:02,526 --> 01:48:04,069
Yeah.

981
01:49:06,006 --> 01:49:06,924
So...

982
01:49:08,509 --> 01:49:09,760
where to?

983
01:49:10,928 --> 01:49:12,680
All New York is holding its breath...

984
01:49:12,888 --> 01:49:15,599
as the hostage crisis
continues to unfold.

985
01:49:17,267 --> 01:49:18,519
Just 30 minutes ago...

986
01:49:18,602 --> 01:49:20,813
police came across
this startling sight:

987
01:49:20,938 --> 01:49:23,107
A young woman,
held hostage in a taxi...

988
01:49:23,315 --> 01:49:25,608
suspended 80 stories
above the ground...

989
01:49:25,609 --> 01:49:28,612
in what appears to be
a giant web.

990
01:49:28,737 --> 01:49:31,448
Every attempt by the police
to rescue the hostage...

991
01:49:31,532 --> 01:49:33,325
has been thwarted
by the Sandman.

992
01:49:36,787 --> 01:49:38,122
Compounding the danger...

993
01:49:38,205 --> 01:49:41,125
is the appearance
of a strange black-suited figure.

994
01:49:41,250 --> 01:49:45,087
Early reports had believed him
to be the black-suited Spider-Man...

995
01:49:45,129 --> 01:49:48,757
but he has now been identified
as something entirely different.

996
01:49:50,300 --> 01:49:53,971
The hostage has been identified
as Mary Jane Watson...

997
01:49:54,054 --> 01:49:58,225
an actress recently seen
in a brief stint on Broadway.

998
01:50:23,792 --> 01:50:26,170
We're now going to take you
live to the scene...

999
01:50:26,295 --> 01:50:28,172
with Jennifer Dugan. Jennifer?

1000
01:50:28,255 --> 01:50:30,882
We're only about
100 feet away now, Hal, and...

1001
01:50:30,883 --> 01:50:34,845
Wait. There seems to be
some kind of activity in the web.

1002
01:50:34,928 --> 01:50:38,599
They seem to be creating
some kind of gigantic lettering.

1003
01:50:41,518 --> 01:50:44,313
Spider-Man's being challenged
to some sort of confrontation.

1004
01:50:44,438 --> 01:50:46,190
And that raises serious questions...

1005
01:50:46,315 --> 01:50:49,526
about what kind of chance he'd
stand against such overwhelming...

1006
01:51:00,079 --> 01:51:01,330
Harry?

1007
01:51:04,875 --> 01:51:06,960
I need your help.

1008
01:51:07,378 --> 01:51:10,798
I can't take them both,
not by myself.

1009
01:51:17,304 --> 01:51:20,182
You don't deserve my help.

1010
01:51:22,893 --> 01:51:24,353
Harry...

1011
01:51:25,104 --> 01:51:27,189
she needs us.

1012
01:51:31,777 --> 01:51:33,320
Get out.

1013
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:52,214
If I may, sir?

1014
01:51:52,923 --> 01:51:58,554
I've seen things in this house
I've never spoken of.

1015
01:51:58,887 --> 01:52:00,556
What are you trying to tell me?

1016
01:52:01,265 --> 01:52:04,101
The night your father died...

1017
01:52:04,184 --> 01:52:06,812
I cleaned his wound.

1018
01:52:08,272 --> 01:52:12,025
The blade that pierced his body...

1019
01:52:12,026 --> 01:52:14,820
came from his glider.

1020
01:52:15,571 --> 01:52:20,575
I know you're trying to defend
your father's honor...

1021
01:52:20,576 --> 01:52:25,998
but there's no question
that he died by his own hand.

1022
01:52:29,043 --> 01:52:31,503
I loved your father...

1023
01:52:32,671 --> 01:52:35,799
as I have loved you, Harry.

1024
01:52:36,300 --> 01:52:39,219
As your friends love you.

1025
01:53:26,266 --> 01:53:27,518
Look.

1026
01:53:48,372 --> 01:53:52,001
Spider-Man! Spider-Man!
Spider-Man!

1027
01:53:57,464 --> 01:53:59,425
He seems to have
come out of nowhere...

1028
01:53:59,550 --> 01:54:01,593
to answer the prayers of the city...

1029
01:54:01,719 --> 01:54:03,804
just when all hope
seemed to be lost.

1030
01:54:09,727 --> 01:54:12,646
Peter. They're gonna kill us both.

1031
01:54:12,771 --> 01:54:16,400
- I'm gonna get you out of this.
- Watch out.

1032
01:54:25,701 --> 01:54:27,161
Hey, Parker.

1033
01:54:27,369 --> 01:54:28,620
My God. Eddie.

1034
01:54:29,246 --> 01:54:30,998
My spider-sense is tingling...

1035
01:54:32,583 --> 01:54:35,377
if you know what I'm talking about.

1036
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:56,357
We can find a way to settle this.

1037
01:54:56,565 --> 01:54:58,025
You're so right.

1038
01:54:58,108 --> 01:55:01,653
I'm thinking humiliation.

1039
01:55:02,279 --> 01:55:04,698
Kind of like how you humiliated me.

1040
01:55:05,532 --> 01:55:07,284
Do you remember?

1041
01:55:09,078 --> 01:55:11,997
Do you remember
what you did to me?

1042
01:55:27,304 --> 01:55:31,058
You made me lose my girl.
Now I'm gonna make you lose yours.

1043
01:55:32,851 --> 01:55:34,812
How's that sound, tiger?

1044
01:56:34,705 --> 01:56:36,332
Hold on, Mary Jane!

1045
01:57:06,487 --> 01:57:08,989
Mary Jane!

1046
01:58:09,258 --> 01:58:13,219
It's hard to believe
what's happening.

1047
01:58:13,220 --> 01:58:15,597
The brutality of it.

1048
01:58:16,348 --> 01:58:18,225
I don't know how
he can take any more.

1049
01:58:18,308 --> 01:58:21,978
This could be a tragic day
for the people of New York.

1050
01:58:21,979 --> 01:58:24,064
It could be the end of Spider-Man.

1051
01:58:50,424 --> 01:58:52,718
- Awesome.
- Wicked cool.

1052
01:59:17,659 --> 01:59:19,119
You came.

1053
01:59:27,044 --> 01:59:29,129
Looks like just in the nick of time.

1054
01:59:29,338 --> 01:59:31,924
A couple minutes ago
wouldn't have been so bad either.

1055
01:59:32,049 --> 01:59:33,509
What are you gonna do?

1056
01:59:37,054 --> 01:59:39,139
I may need some help over here.

1057
01:59:39,223 --> 01:59:41,725
I'm a little busy right now.

1058
01:59:42,685 --> 01:59:44,561
Give me your hand.

1059
01:59:58,951 --> 02:00:01,954
Parker! Parker, where...?

1060
02:00:02,079 --> 02:00:03,539
I need a photographer.

1061
02:00:03,747 --> 02:00:05,082
Hey, kid, you want a job?

1062
02:00:05,207 --> 02:00:08,627
Why would I want a job?
I'm just a kid.

1063
02:00:08,752 --> 02:00:11,755
- All right, how much for the camera?
- One hundred bucks.

1064
02:00:11,880 --> 02:00:13,340
A hundred bucks?

1065
02:00:15,092 --> 02:00:18,971
All right, you little crook. Here.

1066
02:00:20,639 --> 02:00:21,974
What the...?

1067
02:00:23,851 --> 02:00:25,519
Film's extra.

1068
02:00:31,358 --> 02:00:33,152
Gotcha.

1069
02:00:41,201 --> 02:00:42,411
Pete, up top.

1070
02:01:02,348 --> 02:01:04,433
Mary Jane.

1071
02:01:06,518 --> 02:01:08,395
- This thing got any more?
- Hang on.

1072
02:01:08,479 --> 02:01:09,646
To what?

1073
02:01:14,151 --> 02:01:15,903
- Go, buddy.
- Got her.

1074
02:01:27,164 --> 02:01:28,207
You okay?

1075
02:01:30,417 --> 02:01:31,960
Yeah.

1076
02:01:34,672 --> 02:01:37,174
- Good.
- Hey, Pete.

1077
02:01:39,468 --> 02:01:41,136
Am I interrupting?

1078
02:02:57,463 --> 02:02:59,340
Never wound...

1079
02:03:00,090 --> 02:03:02,134
what you can't kill.

1080
02:03:05,929 --> 02:03:09,557
Eddie, the suit,
you gotta take it off.

1081
02:03:09,558 --> 02:03:11,310
Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

1082
02:03:14,271 --> 02:03:16,106
I know what it feels like.

1083
02:03:16,648 --> 02:03:18,317
It feels good.

1084
02:03:18,442 --> 02:03:21,027
The power. Everything.

1085
02:03:21,028 --> 02:03:23,739
But you'll lose yourself.

1086
02:03:24,156 --> 02:03:26,033
Let it go.

1087
02:03:26,241 --> 02:03:28,327
I like being bad.

1088
02:03:29,370 --> 02:03:31,246
It makes me happy.

1089
02:04:20,671 --> 02:04:21,714
Harry!

1090
02:05:34,828 --> 02:05:37,206
Peter. What are you doing?

1091
02:05:38,040 --> 02:05:39,917
No!

1092
02:05:41,669 --> 02:05:42,711
Eddie!

1093
02:06:02,231 --> 02:06:04,108
- Harry.
- Mary Jane.

1094
02:06:04,316 --> 02:06:06,193
- I'm gonna get help.
- No.

1095
02:06:07,027 --> 02:06:08,487
Stay.

1096
02:06:17,246 --> 02:06:18,914
I didn't want this.

1097
02:06:23,711 --> 02:06:26,005
But I had no choice.

1098
02:06:29,633 --> 02:06:31,719
We always have a choice.

1099
02:06:31,844 --> 02:06:34,138
You had a choice
when you killed my uncle.

1100
02:06:36,640 --> 02:06:38,726
My daughter was dying.

1101
02:06:40,811 --> 02:06:42,771
I needed money.

1102
02:06:47,484 --> 02:06:49,445
I was scared.

1103
02:06:56,994 --> 02:07:00,080
I told your uncle
all I wanted was the car.

1104
02:07:00,205 --> 02:07:02,166
- What is it?
- I need your car.

1105
02:07:02,708 --> 02:07:05,210
He said to me:

1106
02:07:05,336 --> 02:07:08,213
"Why don't you just put down the gun
and go home?"

1107
02:07:12,176 --> 02:07:15,220
I realize now
he was just trying to help me.

1108
02:07:21,894 --> 02:07:25,021
Then I saw my partner
running over with the cash.

1109
02:07:25,022 --> 02:07:27,524
And the gun was in my hand.

1110
02:07:37,868 --> 02:07:39,286
Get in.

1111
02:07:41,205 --> 02:07:43,582
Did a terrible thing to you...

1112
02:07:44,833 --> 02:07:48,379
and I spent a lot of nights
wishing I could take it back.

1113
02:07:53,592 --> 02:07:56,178
I'm not asking you to forgive me.

1114
02:07:57,054 --> 02:07:59,431
I just want you to understand.

1115
02:08:09,233 --> 02:08:11,944
I've done terrible things too.

1116
02:08:28,210 --> 02:08:31,005
I didn't choose to be this.

1117
02:08:39,680 --> 02:08:42,182
The only thing left of me now...

1118
02:08:44,268 --> 02:08:46,228
is my daughter.

1119
02:08:58,449 --> 02:09:00,534
I forgive you.

1120
02:09:43,827 --> 02:09:46,829
Hey, pal. How you doing?

1121
02:09:46,830 --> 02:09:48,499
Been better.

1122
02:09:50,084 --> 02:09:52,044
We'll get you through this.

1123
02:09:55,673 --> 02:09:57,257
No.

1124
02:10:04,848 --> 02:10:07,059
I should never have hurt you...

1125
02:10:08,936 --> 02:10:11,230
said those things.

1126
02:10:12,898 --> 02:10:15,484
None of that matters, Peter.

1127
02:10:17,486 --> 02:10:19,363
You're my friend.

1128
02:10:23,951 --> 02:10:25,828
Best friend.

1129
02:10:44,722 --> 02:10:46,348
Harry.

1130
02:11:32,353 --> 02:11:34,521
Whatever comes our way...

1131
02:11:35,606 --> 02:11:39,943
whatever battle we have raging
inside us, we always have a choice.

1132
02:11:41,862 --> 02:11:44,031
My friend Harry taught me that.

1133
02:11:44,239 --> 02:11:47,576
He chose to be the best of himself.

1134
02:11:48,202 --> 02:11:51,330
It's the choices
that make us who we are...

1135
02:11:51,455 --> 02:11:54,958
and we can always choose
to do what's right.
