00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,525
Why don't you stare at this for a
IittIe whiIe, ya ugIy bastard.

3
00:04:55,085 --> 00:04:58,486
-What are you doing here?
-I'm taking the specimen.

4
00:04:58,522 --> 00:05:01,013
WeII, you can't. I haven't prepped
the cryostasis chamber.

5
00:05:01,925 --> 00:05:05,452
I don't want him frozen, Rowan.
I want him soft.

6
00:05:05,496 --> 00:05:07,930
We've aIready discussed this.

7
00:05:07,965 --> 00:05:12,493
WeII, I had to go over your head. I'm
moving him to our Scranton FaciIity.

8
00:05:12,536 --> 00:05:15,334
Doctor Wimmer, you can't risk
transporting him through open country.

9
00:05:15,372 --> 00:05:17,363
This isn't open for discussion.

10
00:05:17,975 --> 00:05:22,844
His unique abiIity to regenerate Iost
and damaged tissue, I mean,

11
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,144
itjust-itjust cries out
for more research.

12
00:05:25,182 --> 00:05:28,276
And you're wiIIing to risk the death
of innocent civiIians if he escapes.

13
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:28,944
Yes.

14
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,647
But I'm sure Sergeant Marcus and his
men can handIe the transferjustfine.

15
00:05:33,691 --> 00:05:34,487
Sergeant?

16
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,687
Everything's under controI, ma'am.

17
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,162
Doctor Wimmer, pIease.

18
00:05:41,198 --> 00:05:43,496
Rowan, he's no Ionger your probIem.

19
00:05:57,748 --> 00:05:59,545
Can we get that rag off him?

20
00:06:11,462 --> 00:06:13,487
What the heII?

21
00:06:40,357 --> 00:06:41,517
Oh, my God!

22
00:06:47,097 --> 00:06:49,759
-Get outta here.
-What happened?

23
00:06:51,034 --> 00:06:52,092
I'm sorry.

24
00:08:51,388 --> 00:08:54,824
Cryogenic breach.
Emergency lock-down.

25
00:08:58,395 --> 00:09:00,124
Oh, God, no.

26
00:09:02,432 --> 00:09:03,456
Oh. No.

27
00:10:53,543 --> 00:10:54,532
Kay-Em?

28
00:10:55,045 --> 00:10:57,240
No viruses, no bacteria.

29
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,111
No toxins. lt's clean.

30
00:11:05,989 --> 00:11:06,956
It's stiII coId.

31
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,793
Someone want to teII me
what that is?

32
00:11:12,362 --> 00:11:17,299
It's Iike a big kind off-frozen
s-storage thing?

33
00:11:17,734 --> 00:11:19,725
ProbabIy a cryostasis unit.

34
00:11:20,303 --> 00:11:22,168
I'd guess earIy Port series.
Kay-Em?

35
00:11:22,205 --> 00:11:25,368
Quadroport EIeven.
Manufactured in Twenty-ten.

36
00:11:25,409 --> 00:11:27,570
Precise historic records
are inconsistent.

37
00:11:31,415 --> 00:11:34,475
-Anyone thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
-Open it up.

38
00:11:53,236 --> 00:11:55,067
What the heII is that?

39
00:11:55,105 --> 00:11:58,199
Humanoid.
Organic composition is uncIear.

40
00:11:58,408 --> 00:12:00,308
Can someone teII me
what's on his face?

41
00:12:00,677 --> 00:12:05,808
Uh, some kinda twentieth-century
carbon fiItration unit?

42
00:12:07,084 --> 00:12:10,281
-It's a hockey mask.
-Very good, Tsunaron.

43
00:12:11,555 --> 00:12:13,045
What's a hockey mask?

44
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:16,787
FaciaI armor. Used in a sport
outIawed in Twenty-Twenty-Four.

45
00:12:18,128 --> 00:12:19,095
Amazing.

46
00:12:20,397 --> 00:12:22,524
AbsoIute museum quaIity.

47
00:12:24,735 --> 00:12:26,566
Are you paying attention, AzraeI?

48
00:12:26,603 --> 00:12:27,797
Yeah.

49
00:12:30,073 --> 00:12:31,768
WeII, don't touch anything.

50
00:12:52,429 --> 00:12:55,193
Guys. We got another body here.

51
00:13:03,306 --> 00:13:03,965
Kay-Em?

52
00:13:04,007 --> 00:13:08,740
She's perfectIy preserved.
CeII crystaIIization's at 25 percent.

53
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:09,905
Twenty-five percent?

54
00:13:09,946 --> 00:13:13,143
Suggest extensive nanotech
and phase one ceII reconstruction.

55
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:16,442
Wait-Waita minute, areyou...
are you saying that...

56
00:13:17,387 --> 00:13:19,378
that we can bring her back to Iife?

57
00:13:19,422 --> 00:13:21,617
Yes. But she is deteriorating.

58
00:13:21,658 --> 00:13:24,149
Opening the door has compromised
her hibernation.

59
00:13:24,194 --> 00:13:27,186
Lou, get ready for dust-off.
We have a priority evac.

60
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,925
Copy that, ready in five.

61
00:13:28,965 --> 00:13:30,330
Notfive, now.

62
00:13:33,503 --> 00:13:34,629
What the--?

63
00:13:36,673 --> 00:13:37,537
Look out!

64
00:13:43,513 --> 00:13:46,710
Fifty-five cc's ofetherene.
You'II be fine.

65
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,150
F-Fine? I'm missing my arm!

66
00:13:57,894 --> 00:13:59,521
Oh, you're so pretty.

67
00:14:22,986 --> 00:14:25,978
-Kicker, are the doors secure?
-Locked and bIocked.

68
00:14:26,022 --> 00:14:30,391
BeautifuI. Liftoff in three, two...

69
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,461
I Iove this part.

70
00:14:46,676 --> 00:14:47,802
What'd you find?

71
00:14:47,844 --> 00:14:51,041
Won't beIieve it.
Get the sarge on the horn.

72
00:14:51,948 --> 00:14:54,974
Didyou hear?Division four
justenteredthe occupiedzone.

73
00:14:55,018 --> 00:14:56,212
-CasuaIties?
-MinimaI.

74
00:14:56,453 --> 00:14:58,683
You know, I'd Iove to know how
we got this screwed-up gig.

75
00:14:58,722 --> 00:15:01,748
Yeah, weII, I didn'tjoin the corps
to become a friggin' baby sitter.

76
00:15:09,332 --> 00:15:12,062
-Brodski, here.
-Sarge, we founda viable down here.

77
00:15:12,102 --> 00:15:12,568
Say again?

78
00:15:12,602 --> 00:15:15,002
We found two bodies
in deep cryostasis.

79
00:15:15,305 --> 00:15:18,297
The Kay-Em unit thinks we can
resuscitate the femaIe.

80
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:19,473
FemaIe?

81
00:15:21,177 --> 00:15:22,144
Yeah.

82
00:15:22,979 --> 00:15:24,003
Crutch, do you copy?

83
00:15:25,615 --> 00:15:26,809
Crutch, doyou readme?

84
00:15:27,918 --> 00:15:29,283
Crutch, wake the heII up.

85
00:15:30,053 --> 00:15:32,021
-Yeah, what do you want?
-They're on their way back.

86
00:15:32,155 --> 00:15:33,952
Prepare for docking
and power up the Iab.

87
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,855
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever.

88
00:15:57,948 --> 00:16:00,178
-So, what does she Iook Iike?
-She's cute.

89
00:16:00,717 --> 00:16:02,412
Yeah. And singIe.

90
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,153
I'm so IoneIy.

91
00:16:34,884 --> 00:16:36,442
We need to get her to the Iab.

92
00:16:41,925 --> 00:16:44,587
-You think you can bring her back?
-We'II find out, sergeant.

93
00:16:48,131 --> 00:16:51,794
-You're not gonna bring him back?
-No, it's impossibIe.

94
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,898
Aw, shit. I forgot my arm.

95
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,272
Yeah, here you go, dumb-ass.

96
00:16:59,642 --> 00:17:01,007
Hi, hand.

97
00:17:03,713 --> 00:17:06,773
-Any idea how Iong she's been down?
-Four-point-five-five centuries.

98
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,075
Must've been one heII of
a wake-up caII.

99
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,088
-I'm bitchy as heII when I wake up.
-Did you just wake up?

100
00:17:17,394 --> 00:17:20,363
-Kinsa.
-You guys aIways find the cooI shit.

101
00:17:20,397 --> 00:17:23,764
-Where's WayIander?
-He's in Iab one, charging the bed now.

102
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,665
Good. Find Stoney and Adrienne
and get to Iab two.

103
00:17:27,003 --> 00:17:29,130
Once we're in the cIear,
I'd Iike to check your circuits.

104
00:17:29,172 --> 00:17:31,140
Oh, I'II bet you wouId.

105
00:17:31,174 --> 00:17:32,436
It isn't Iike that.

106
00:17:34,878 --> 00:17:37,642
-Adrienne, good. I need you in Iab two.
-You found something, didn't you?

107
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,942
-Two viabIes.
-Two? In what condition?

108
00:17:38,982 --> 00:17:40,847
Perfect. We're attempting reanimation
with one ofthem.

109
00:17:40,884 --> 00:17:41,873
Great, what can I do?

110
00:17:41,918 --> 00:17:44,512
-You, Stoney and Kinsa they're second...
-They're gonna sIow me down.

111
00:17:44,554 --> 00:17:46,385
Just waIk them through it, okay?

112
00:17:46,423 --> 00:17:48,914
Run a compIete structuraI scan, Iog them
in properIy and put them in stasis.

113
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:51,449
-I'II check back with you Iater.
-Fine.

114
00:17:54,697 --> 00:17:55,823
Okay, where are we?

115
00:17:55,865 --> 00:17:57,765
The board's aII green, teach.
The N-two's warm and ready.

116
00:17:57,801 --> 00:18:00,770
Good. Kay-Em, begin stabiIizing
any ceIIuIar fractures.

117
00:18:00,804 --> 00:18:01,736
Yes, professor.

118
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:05,099
Janessa, I need a fuII scan.
GIyceroI IeveIs,

119
00:18:05,141 --> 00:18:06,938
cerebraI profusion, the whoIe works.

120
00:18:06,976 --> 00:18:07,908
I Iive to serve, professor.

121
00:18:07,977 --> 00:18:09,672
Let's see what we're deaIin'
with here.

122
00:18:09,712 --> 00:18:12,647
DecrystaIization ofthe membranes
is now atThirty-two percent.

123
00:18:12,682 --> 00:18:14,172
Good. Somebody get those
cIothes off her.

124
00:18:14,217 --> 00:18:15,115
Oh, I got it!

125
00:18:15,819 --> 00:18:18,788
I got it. HonestIy.

126
00:18:19,189 --> 00:18:21,453
WayIander... where's her diffusion
barriers?

127
00:18:23,293 --> 00:18:24,726
Seventeen and stabIe.

128
00:18:24,761 --> 00:18:25,785
Here we go.

129
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:33,658
Stay stiII or you'II end up getting
an eIbow where your wrist shouId be.

130
00:18:39,075 --> 00:18:43,034
Specimen forty-four twenty found in
sector 39-30 L on Earth prime.

131
00:18:43,213 --> 00:18:45,613
Subject discovered in compIete
cryosuspension.

132
00:19:13,776 --> 00:19:15,573
-How's it goin'?
-Good, man. What's up?

133
00:19:18,181 --> 00:19:20,775
-Hey, where do you want this?
-On the specimen tabIe.

134
00:19:21,184 --> 00:19:22,947
-Hi, baby.
-Hey, gorgeous.

135
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,810
Initiating scan.

136
00:19:28,758 --> 00:19:31,124
Mm, smart and sexy.

137
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:35,659
Professor. Take a look
atthisguy's scan.

138
00:19:39,202 --> 00:19:40,294
Amazing.

139
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,904
How does he function
with a brain that smaII?

140
00:19:43,173 --> 00:19:45,164
-Way manages.
-That's very funny.

141
00:19:45,775 --> 00:19:49,336
-He's a big boy.
-I bet he's hung Iike a mammoth.

142
00:19:56,619 --> 00:19:58,780
Okay, you guys. You know what?
Just get the heII outta here...

143
00:19:58,821 --> 00:20:00,482
and come back when you're
more focused.

144
00:20:01,057 --> 00:20:03,150
-You serious?
-Yes, just go.

145
00:20:03,393 --> 00:20:05,190
-Thanks, Adrienne. Come.
-Thanks.

146
00:20:05,461 --> 00:20:06,519
Don't mention it.

147
00:20:07,363 --> 00:20:09,524
See whatyou can salvage
from the optic cortex.

148
00:20:09,732 --> 00:20:12,030
-Then move on.
-My pIeasure, professor.

149
00:20:12,602 --> 00:20:14,160
Ready phase two.

150
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,798
Bring on the ants.

151
00:20:49,272 --> 00:20:51,137
That's it. Come to mama.

152
00:21:13,162 --> 00:21:16,495
Temperature, ninety-six-point-two.
Ninety-seven.

153
00:21:16,866 --> 00:21:18,197
CooI. It's working.

154
00:21:18,234 --> 00:21:19,895
Ninety-eight-point-six and hoIding.

155
00:21:21,004 --> 00:21:24,167
CeII reconstruction is compIete.
InternaI de-fib in three...

156
00:21:25,408 --> 00:21:27,308
two...one.

157
00:22:00,443 --> 00:22:01,671
Easy. Easy.

158
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,806
VitaI signs are normaI and strong.

159
00:22:07,383 --> 00:22:07,849
No shit.

160
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,216
Easy. Easy.

161
00:22:11,654 --> 00:22:13,485
Oh, d-- Did ya get him?

162
00:22:14,324 --> 00:22:15,814
Where is he?
TeII me you got him.

163
00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:16,855
Got who?

164
00:22:17,293 --> 00:22:19,523
Uh, n-n-n-no one's here.
You're s-safe with us.

165
00:22:22,398 --> 00:22:24,923
There was a I-There was a Ieak
i-in the cryo-unit and....

166
00:22:27,403 --> 00:22:28,597
Ho, was he contained?

167
00:22:29,906 --> 00:22:31,134
It was contained.

168
00:22:31,407 --> 00:22:34,103
But when the cryo-unit ruptured,
you didn'tescape it.

169
00:22:34,444 --> 00:22:35,536
ltputyou into stasis.

170
00:22:39,015 --> 00:22:40,539
For how Iong?

171
00:22:43,052 --> 00:22:44,542
The year is twenty-four fifty-five.

172
00:22:45,555 --> 00:22:49,116
Now, l-l-lknow this is
a huge shock...

173
00:22:49,158 --> 00:22:50,523
butyou'regonna be safe here.

174
00:22:54,163 --> 00:22:58,122
You're aboard GrendeI, a cIass-four,
catamaran transport ship.

175
00:22:58,167 --> 00:22:59,532
We're on our wayback home and...

176
00:23:00,103 --> 00:23:02,503
you'regonna bejustfine.

177
00:23:11,514 --> 00:23:13,505
Twenty-four fifty-five?

178
00:23:18,121 --> 00:23:19,486
That's over four hundred years.

179
00:23:28,531 --> 00:23:31,523
Secure Iine. Perez, Dieter.

180
00:23:31,567 --> 00:23:34,536
SoIaris Research Station. Connect.

181
00:23:44,046 --> 00:23:47,106
Lowe. You bastard.

182
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,515
We've hit the mother Iode.

183
00:23:48,551 --> 00:23:50,542
Do you know what time it is?

184
00:23:50,586 --> 00:23:52,554
I don't care.
We've got a goIdmine.

185
00:23:53,389 --> 00:23:55,516
A box of DVDs is not a goIdmine.

186
00:23:58,394 --> 00:23:59,520
Now, I've toId ya, I can't move .

187
00:23:59,562 --> 00:24:00,551
Just Iook at the fiIe.

188
00:24:00,596 --> 00:24:04,498
Two four-hundred-year-oId frozen
specimens. One weII-preserved...

189
00:24:05,101 --> 00:24:09,265
the other one. Are you ready for this?
Up and waIking around.

190
00:24:09,305 --> 00:24:10,704
Four hundred years oId...

191
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,935
and waIkin' around.

192
00:24:12,975 --> 00:24:16,467
Yeah. Four hundred and fifty-five
years, to be exact.

193
00:24:16,546 --> 00:24:18,514
Who cares?
Who gives a shit?

194
00:24:18,548 --> 00:24:21,517
PeopIe. PeopIe wiII pay huge
money to see her.

195
00:24:21,551 --> 00:24:23,519
Let me ask you a question.

196
00:24:23,553 --> 00:24:27,512
Is this the first person you've
reanimated?

197
00:24:27,557 --> 00:24:28,524
Ofcourse not.

198
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:30,526
How many peopIe are out there today,

199
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,519
waIkin' around thawed out
and Iookin' good?

200
00:24:34,564 --> 00:24:35,531
-Hundreds.
-Thousands.

201
00:24:35,565 --> 00:24:38,534
Maybe. But notfour hundred
and fifty years oId.

202
00:24:38,568 --> 00:24:40,536
She's nearIy twice as oId
as anyone on the pIanet.

203
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:43,539
Two-fifty, four-fifty,
what's the difference?

204
00:24:43,573 --> 00:24:49,534
Doctor, a hundred years ago when
reanimation was more unpredictabIe,

205
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:51,507
sure, maybe. But now...

206
00:24:51,581 --> 00:24:53,549
it's oId news.

207
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:56,552
Damn it. I need money.

208
00:24:56,586 --> 00:24:59,555
Oh, I know. I know.

209
00:25:02,191 --> 00:25:05,490
The other viabIe is marked
''Voorhees.''

210
00:25:06,162 --> 00:25:09,495
That's notJason Voorhees, is it?

211
00:25:09,532 --> 00:25:12,467
-What do you know about him?
-Jason Voorhees.

212
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:17,130
Oh, he kiIIed nearIy
two hundred peopIe...

213
00:25:17,173 --> 00:25:19,505
and simpIy disappeared
without a trace.

214
00:25:20,309 --> 00:25:23,472
Why, to the right buyer he couId be
worth, uh, a fortune.

215
00:25:25,948 --> 00:25:27,939
WeII, I've got him frozen right
here on the ship.

216
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,781
You work out a Iist ofownership?

217
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:33,482
No Iist. He's my find.
He's-He's mine.

218
00:25:33,589 --> 00:25:35,318
What about your students?

219
00:25:35,358 --> 00:25:39,294
WeII, they're students. The
educationaI experience wiII be enough.

220
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:42,229
Doctor, doctor, you are one
son ofa bitch.

221
00:25:42,265 --> 00:25:43,892
Soon to be one rich son ofa bitch.

222
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:45,527
Lowe out.

223
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:55,967
I think that, uh, we need to taIk
about my midterm.

224
00:26:42,992 --> 00:26:45,961
Poor baby. No wonder you wore
this thing.

225
00:26:53,002 --> 00:26:55,971
Harder. Harder.

226
00:26:56,005 --> 00:26:58,974
Who's been a naughty IittIe boy?

227
00:26:59,008 --> 00:27:02,910
M-I have.
Oh. Harder.

228
00:27:02,945 --> 00:27:04,913
You want it a IittIe harder?
Yeah? How's that?

229
00:27:04,947 --> 00:27:06,915
-Yeah. Oh, good.
-Yeah?

230
00:27:06,949 --> 00:27:07,916
-Yeah. That's it.
-That's it, right there?

231
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:08,917
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah?

232
00:27:09,118 --> 00:27:09,982
-Daddy Iikes it hard?
-Yeah. Yeah.

233
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:11,919
-Daddy wants it hard, huh?
-Yeah.

234
00:27:11,954 --> 00:27:12,921
-Yeah?
-Oh, yeah. That's it...

235
00:27:12,955 --> 00:27:13,922
-Right there?
-Yeah.

236
00:27:13,956 --> 00:27:15,924
-You Iike it right there?
-Yeah. Yeah.

237
00:27:15,958 --> 00:27:16,925
-A IittIe harder for...
-Yeah!

238
00:27:16,959 --> 00:27:17,926
-daddy?
-Yeah!

239
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,927
-Come on!
-Yeah! Yeah!

240
00:27:18,961 --> 00:27:21,930
-Come on!
-You pass!

241
00:28:18,688 --> 00:28:20,485
What do you think?

242
00:28:20,523 --> 00:28:22,616
-Do you Iike them?
-They're fine.

243
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:29,760
Look, Kay-Em, I don't think this is
going to work.

244
00:28:30,366 --> 00:28:32,129
Why do you want those things
anyways?

245
00:28:32,201 --> 00:28:34,499
-Janessa has them.
-WeII, Janessa's....

246
00:28:34,937 --> 00:28:36,461
-ReaI?
-Yes.

247
00:28:37,373 --> 00:28:39,500
Let's not compIicate things,
aII right?

248
00:28:40,209 --> 00:28:43,508
I Iike you just the way you are.
I think you're perfect.

249
00:28:44,246 --> 00:28:44,507
Okay.

250
00:30:22,311 --> 00:30:23,539
HeIp, WayIand! No!

251
00:30:24,413 --> 00:30:25,539
Somebody heIp me!

252
00:30:26,682 --> 00:30:28,547
HeIp me! No! No! No! No!

253
00:31:15,231 --> 00:31:16,528
I brought you something to eat.

254
00:31:18,901 --> 00:31:20,528
Not much Ionger and we'II be
at Earth Two.

255
00:31:21,403 --> 00:31:24,201
Earth Two?
What happened to Earth One?

256
00:31:25,107 --> 00:31:28,838
Yeah, weII, it's dead. The oceans,
the soiI, neither wiII sustain Iife.

257
00:31:29,745 --> 00:31:31,975
Can I do anything eIse for you?

258
00:31:52,768 --> 00:31:54,668
You wanna teII me what happened
down there?

259
00:31:54,703 --> 00:31:58,605
I take it being stabbed and frozen
wasn't part ofyour pIan.

260
00:31:58,774 --> 00:32:04,269
I'm a... I was a project Ieader
at CrystaI Lake Research.

261
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,348
The subject was Jason Voorhees.

262
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:07,508
Jason Voorhees?

263
00:32:08,951 --> 00:32:10,509
Notorious murderer?

264
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:15,516
We executed him for the first time
in two thousand eight.

265
00:32:15,557 --> 00:32:16,524
For the first time?

266
00:32:17,293 --> 00:32:20,524
We tried everything. EIectrocution,
gas, firing squad.

267
00:32:21,964 --> 00:32:24,524
We even hung him once.
Nothing worked.

268
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:27,528
FinaIIy, it was decided that
ifwe couIdn't terminate him,

269
00:32:27,603 --> 00:32:28,535
we couId at Ieast contain him.

270
00:32:28,704 --> 00:32:32,538
Cryogenic stasis. Freeze him untiI
we couId figure out what to do.

271
00:32:32,641 --> 00:32:34,541
-Seems sensibIe.
-I thought so.

272
00:32:35,144 --> 00:32:37,544
But unfortunateIy some peopIe who
were too smartfor their own good...

273
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:42,547
feIt that a creature that couIdn't be
kiIIed was simpIy too vaIuabIe...

274
00:32:42,584 --> 00:32:43,551
tojustfiIe away.

275
00:32:45,587 --> 00:32:47,555
In the end, it aIways comes down
to money.

276
00:32:53,595 --> 00:32:55,563
How do you thank someone who
gives you back your Iife?

277
00:32:56,565 --> 00:32:58,556
WeII, you're gonna be aIive
for a Iong time.

278
00:32:59,335 --> 00:33:00,563
We'II figure out something.

279
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:11,511
Why don't you just admit it?
You want me.

280
00:33:12,548 --> 00:33:16,507
I couId never be with a girI whose
baIIs are bigger than mine.

281
00:33:19,555 --> 00:33:23,514
Guys, our star patient is back.
Rowan, this is Tsunaron and Janessa.

282
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,527
-Hi.
-Hi.

283
00:33:25,561 --> 00:33:27,529
Hi. I see that my cIothes fit okay.

284
00:33:27,563 --> 00:33:30,532
Oh, these are yours.
They're great. Thank you.

285
00:33:31,567 --> 00:33:34,536
Whoa. What are those?

286
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:36,538
These are Janessa's Iove chiIdren.

287
00:33:37,573 --> 00:33:43,534
You see now, it is that wit ofyours
that is what repeIs aII human femaIes.

288
00:33:43,579 --> 00:33:45,547
And, ofcourse, you've met
Sergeant Brodski.

289
00:33:45,581 --> 00:33:47,549
-Yes. Hi, again.
-Hi.

290
00:33:47,583 --> 00:33:52,543
And this is the IoveIy Kay-Em Fourteen.
Tsunaron's IittIe Iove-bot.

291
00:33:52,588 --> 00:33:54,556
Easy, Janessa.

292
00:33:55,124 --> 00:33:58,560
Kay-Em is a knowIedge matrix android
that I have been programing.

293
00:33:59,361 --> 00:34:00,555
Amazing.

294
00:34:03,532 --> 00:34:06,467
-She Iooks so reaI.
-I am reaI.

295
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:09,232
-Professor, where do you want this?
-Uh, Iab two, I think.

296
00:34:09,271 --> 00:34:09,498
-Sure.
-Thank you.

297
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:10,503
Where did you get that?

298
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:14,507
Uh, from your friend.
The big guy with the hockey mask.

299
00:34:14,543 --> 00:34:16,511
-You brought him on board?
-He's in the next Iab.

300
00:34:16,545 --> 00:34:18,513
-We're quite safe.
-Safe?

301
00:34:18,547 --> 00:34:21,516
Our scans reveaI him to be very dead.

302
00:34:23,552 --> 00:34:25,520
CouId your scans be wrong?

303
00:34:25,554 --> 00:34:27,522
I think you shouId just get rid
of him, professor.

304
00:34:27,556 --> 00:34:28,523
He's too dangerous.

305
00:34:28,557 --> 00:34:31,526
WeII, that wouId be irresponsibIe
and fooIhardy.

306
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,529
He's a vaIuabIe scientific artifact
that must be carefuIIy preserved.

307
00:34:34,563 --> 00:34:36,531

309
00:34:43,572 --> 00:34:45,540

Gruntteam, reportto weapons.

-Baby, I'm not ready yet.
-WeII, hurry up.

318
00:35:25,547 --> 00:35:28,516
Sarge, grunt team's assembIed.

319
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:29,517
Sergeant--

323
00:35:35,557 --> 00:35:36,524
Oh, God.

325
00:35:42,564 --> 00:35:44,532
-Oh, my God.

326
00:35:45,567 --> 00:35:48,536
Kicker! I wantfuII armor and tac.

327
00:35:49,104 --> 00:35:51,538
I want nothing Ieft ofthis guy
by the time we reach SoIaris.

328
00:35:51,573 --> 00:35:53,541
Roger that. You heard him, grunts?
Let's get movin'!

329
00:35:53,575 --> 00:35:56,544
Nothin' Ieft of him?
What have you got in mind?

330
00:35:56,578 --> 00:36:00,537
Take your kids to Iab one
and stay there tiII you hear from me.

331
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:09,484
I just saved your ass.

332
00:37:10,485 --> 00:37:12,214
You know, don't get cocky.

333
00:37:12,254 --> 00:37:14,916
I mean, you must reaIIy feeI Iike
a wuss. Huh, there, big boy?

334
00:37:14,957 --> 00:37:17,482
Hey, check the score, kid.
It's stiII nine-three.

335
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:20,495
Yeah, but I got my groove on now.
You know what I'm sayin'?

336
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:22,497
So, what do you say next kiII wins?

337
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:23,498
Lock and Ioad, kiIIer.

338
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:26,501
You're goin' down.
You are so goin' down.

339
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,507
Whatthe hell?

340
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:35,510
-I thought this was an aIien sim.
-Yeah, it is.

341
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:36,511
Pause pIay.

342
00:37:39,114 --> 00:37:40,513
I said, pause pIay.

343
00:37:41,149 --> 00:37:42,514
-Uh, he's not pausing.
-Yeah, no kidding.

344
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:46,521
I think we need to reboot.

345
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:52,516
-That does not count as a kiII.
-Oh, yes it does.

346
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:58,533
Okay, screw this. Game over.

347
00:38:13,081 --> 00:38:14,480
What the heII?

348
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:22,479
Hey, drop the kid!
Drop the kid! Now!

349
00:38:27,529 --> 00:38:29,497
AzraeI, get outta here!

350
00:38:33,535 --> 00:38:35,503
I got him! I got him!

351
00:38:35,537 --> 00:38:37,505
AzraeI... I got no shot!
Move!

352
00:38:53,221 --> 00:38:54,518
Sergeant Brodski.

353
00:38:54,556 --> 00:38:57,525
Don't Ieave those kids aIone.
What the heII's the matter with you?

354
00:38:57,559 --> 00:38:59,527
We are Iess than an hour from SoIaris.
They have seven...

355
00:38:59,561 --> 00:39:01,529
fuIIy equipped tacticaI units
there that are more than...

356
00:39:01,563 --> 00:39:02,461
capabIe oftaking care ofthis.

357
00:39:02,497 --> 00:39:04,465
I say we wait and sedate him.

358
00:39:04,499 --> 00:39:07,468
-I am takin' this guy out.
-Sergeant, I need him aIive.

359
00:39:07,502 --> 00:39:10,471
No, you want him aIive, but what you
need is to get out of my way.

360
00:39:10,505 --> 00:39:12,473
Look, there are other considerations.

361
00:39:12,507 --> 00:39:14,475
FinanciaI considerations.

362
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:18,475
My onIy consideration is the safety
ofthe peopIe on this ship.

363
00:39:20,916 --> 00:39:22,474
AII right, a hundred thousand.

364
00:39:23,518 --> 00:39:24,485
Two hundred.

365
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,487
Five.

366
00:39:27,522 --> 00:39:28,489
Five?

367
00:39:34,062 --> 00:39:36,223
-Kicker, DaIIas not here yet?
-Nope.

368
00:39:36,264 --> 00:39:38,255
You, Briggs, find him,
bring him up to speed.

369
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,494
Condor, you have a BFG?

370
00:39:39,534 --> 00:39:42,503
You're with me. Sven, Geko,
you got the starboard pontoon.

371
00:39:42,537 --> 00:39:45,506
Sarge what do we do when
we find this guy?

372
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,508
WeII, I promised the doc we'd
take him aIive.

373
00:39:49,544 --> 00:39:50,511
Man.

374
00:39:50,545 --> 00:39:53,514
So, after you bIow him aII
to heII, put one in his Ieg so...

375
00:39:53,548 --> 00:39:54,515
-we can say we tried.
-Yeah.

376
00:39:54,549 --> 00:39:55,516
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

377
00:40:20,575 --> 00:40:21,542
Oh, Lord.

378
00:40:27,582 --> 00:40:29,550
Sarge, I got DaIIas.

379
00:40:29,584 --> 00:40:31,552
-Where the hell is he?
-He's dead.

380
00:40:36,591 --> 00:40:38,559
-Sarge, we got a body in bay two.
-Who is it?

381
00:40:38,593 --> 00:40:41,562
lt's Azrael. Whatthe hell's
goin'on here?

382
00:40:43,598 --> 00:40:46,567
Sarge, we got a bIood traiI headin'
toward the cargo bay.

383
00:40:46,601 --> 00:40:48,569
Condor, Kicker and I wiII take cargo
main.

384
00:40:49,137 --> 00:40:50,570
The rest ofyou take portside.

385
00:40:51,606 --> 00:40:53,574
I hope they know what they're doing.

386
00:40:54,609 --> 00:40:56,577
These guys Iive for this stuff.

387
00:41:03,552 --> 00:41:04,519
Sorry.

388
00:41:07,556 --> 00:41:08,523
-Don't do that!
-Dude.

389
00:41:08,557 --> 00:41:11,526
-What?
-You scream Iike a girI.

390
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,528
-Screw you.
-You wish.

391
00:41:40,222 --> 00:41:41,553
Lou, is that you?

392
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:02,506
Lou, I swear, you mess with an
engineer,

393
00:42:02,544 --> 00:42:04,512
you're gonna wake up in the morning
with a waste hose in your bunk.

394
00:42:07,549 --> 00:42:08,516
AsshoIe.

395
00:42:30,305 --> 00:42:31,533
What the heII?

396
00:42:31,573 --> 00:42:33,541
Crutch, get down now!

397
00:43:00,835 --> 00:43:04,498
-What the heII's going on here?
-Crutch, out now!

398
00:43:08,543 --> 00:43:10,511
Aw, you wrecked my stuff, man.

399
00:43:16,551 --> 00:43:18,519
We naiIed him.
He's gotta be here.

400
00:43:22,557 --> 00:43:24,525
Condor, air borne.

401
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:25,526
Briggs.

402
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:33,527
Where the heII's Sven?

403
00:44:37,565 --> 00:44:39,533
Condor, anything topside?

404
00:44:43,571 --> 00:44:45,539
Negative, sarge.
There's no sign ofhim.

405
00:44:48,576 --> 00:44:50,544
This isn't gonna work.

406
00:45:02,524 --> 00:45:04,492
Keep your eyes peeIed.

407
00:45:10,865 --> 00:45:12,492
Everything's under controI.

408
00:45:30,552 --> 00:45:32,520
Condor, report.

409
00:45:33,555 --> 00:45:34,522
Sven, report.

410
00:45:36,558 --> 00:45:38,526
Condor, report.

411
00:45:39,561 --> 00:45:40,528
Report!

412
00:45:42,063 --> 00:45:42,529
Damn.

413
00:46:04,519 --> 00:46:06,487
Sarge, we found Condor.

414
00:46:06,521 --> 00:46:08,489
What's his condition?

415
00:46:09,524 --> 00:46:10,491
He's screwed.

416
00:46:14,529 --> 00:46:16,497
Let's smoke this fucker.

417
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:36,517
God.

418
00:46:37,552 --> 00:46:40,521
Sarge, uh, Sven's dead.

419
00:46:40,555 --> 00:46:43,524
Jesus. You have got to get them
out ofthere.

420
00:46:43,558 --> 00:46:45,526
They know what they're doing.

421
00:47:41,549 --> 00:47:42,516
Oh, man.

422
00:47:43,551 --> 00:47:45,519
Geko, Geko.

423
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,487

Yes, yes. See, they got him.

426
00:48:27,528 --> 00:48:30,497
Don't take your eyes off him.
I'm on my way.

427
00:48:30,531 --> 00:48:33,500
Take your time, sarge.
He ain't goin' nowhere.

428
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:53,509
Briggs...
get out of here.

429
00:48:54,555 --> 00:48:57,524
Kicker. Briggs.
Where are you, damn it?

430
00:49:11,506 --> 00:49:13,474
He's aII aIone in there.

431
00:49:45,073 --> 00:49:48,509
It's gonna take more than a poke in
the ribs to put down this oId dog.

432
00:49:50,545 --> 00:49:52,513
Yeah...that oughta do it.

433
00:50:05,126 --> 00:50:06,525
Such a waste.

434
00:50:10,064 --> 00:50:11,531
I toId him to stay caIm.

435
00:50:12,567 --> 00:50:15,536
To wait untiI we got to SoIaris and
then we couId take care ofthis...

436
00:50:16,571 --> 00:50:17,538
monster.

437
00:50:21,776 --> 00:50:23,539
I said, ''Don't go in unprepared.''

438
00:50:27,582 --> 00:50:29,550
Brodski wasjust too proud.

439
00:50:40,161 --> 00:50:42,561
Who lockedthe damn door?

440
00:50:46,601 --> 00:50:49,570
Somebody wanna teII me
what the heII is goin' on?

441
00:50:49,604 --> 00:50:50,571
Grunts are dead.

442
00:50:51,606 --> 00:50:53,574
-Which ones?
-AII of'em.

443
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:04,518
Oh. Oh, man.

444
00:51:07,555 --> 00:51:09,523
Lou...how Iong tiII we reach SoIaris?

445
00:51:10,191 --> 00:51:12,523
I'm takin' us out of hyperdrive
right now.

446
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:18,521
Kids and their goddamn fieId trips,

447
00:51:19,567 --> 00:51:21,535
Just bring a psycho on board.

448
00:51:21,569 --> 00:51:23,537
Yeah, sure. I just know I'm gonna
get bIamed for this shit.

449
00:51:23,571 --> 00:51:25,539
Solaris to Grendel,

Look we're gonna be aII right.

456

He's trapped in the cargo bay.
We're Iocked up in here.

457
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:54,568
-Can the SoIaris grunts kiII him?
-AbsoIuteIy.

458
00:51:56,337 --> 00:51:57,565
I've been in constant contact
with SoIaris.

459
00:51:57,605 --> 00:52:00,574
They have sixty highIy trained

471
00:53:11,546 --> 00:53:13,514
Hang on.

472
00:53:21,556 --> 00:53:22,523
Oh, my God.

473
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:25,526
SoIaris is gone.

474
00:53:26,561 --> 00:53:27,528
Gone?

475
00:53:28,563 --> 00:53:31,532
-It can't be gone.
-Look for yourseIf. It's gone.

476
00:53:33,034 --> 00:53:34,524
What are we gonna do?

477
00:53:39,574 --> 00:53:42,543
Lou. What sorta damage we...
Iookin' at?

478
00:53:45,346 --> 00:53:46,973
I'm sending out a distress beacon.

479
00:53:47,014 --> 00:53:48,106
Lou?

480
00:53:48,149 --> 00:53:51,209
Guys, we've Iost our entire
port pontoon.

481
00:53:51,552 --> 00:53:53,349
The internaI pressure is stabIe.

482
00:53:53,387 --> 00:53:55,548
-The main thrusters are offline.
-Life support?

483
00:53:55,590 --> 00:53:58,559
-We shouId be okay for a whiIe.
-But he's out there.

484
00:53:58,593 --> 00:54:01,562
Look, we're gonna be fine. We're in
a high- voIume traffic Iane.

485
00:54:01,596 --> 00:54:04,497
Another ship's gonna come by,
I-I-I'm sure of it.

486
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:08,502
We're-We're gonna be safe here.

487
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:14,508
Shut up!

488
00:54:32,126 --> 00:54:33,525
What are you doing?

489
00:54:56,584 --> 00:54:57,551
Maybe he gave up.

490
00:54:57,985 --> 00:54:59,543
You reaIIy think so?

491
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:14,496
I don't think he's out there.

492
00:55:15,102 --> 00:55:18,503
Why don't you just stick your head
out and have a peek?

493
00:55:32,219 --> 00:55:34,517
Oh, my God!
Go! Go!

494
00:55:35,556 --> 00:55:37,524
Janessa, go! Come on, go!

495
00:55:37,558 --> 00:55:39,526
Move it, move it, move it!

00:55:40,561 --> 00:55:42,529
Let'sgo!

497
00:56:00,014 --> 00:56:01,914
Where's professor Lowe?

498
00:56:14,962 --> 00:56:15,929
Look...

499
00:56:15,963 --> 00:56:17,931
have you considered
how vaIuabIe you are?

500
00:56:17,965 --> 00:56:19,933
lmean, fame, money.

501
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:22,936
With my heIp,
you're gonna have it aII.

502
00:56:23,971 --> 00:56:26,940
Y-I-I-I...know peopIe, you know?
I mean, I-I have connections!

503
00:56:27,975 --> 00:56:29,943
Together we can-we can make
a fortune.

504
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:33,947
We couId--

505
00:56:35,983 --> 00:56:36,950
Oh, shit.

506
00:56:38,986 --> 00:56:40,954
Oh, you want your machete back.

507
00:56:41,989 --> 00:56:43,957
Shit, it's yours, take it.

508
00:56:45,126 --> 00:56:47,492
Just remember who saved itfor ya.

509
00:56:49,997 --> 00:56:52,966
Guys, it's okay! Hejust wanted
his machete back!

510
00:56:57,004 --> 00:56:58,972
l'm-l'm-l'm-l'mgonnago back...

511
00:56:59,006 --> 00:57:01,907
to my room 'cause Stoney-Stoney's
gonna meet me there.

512
00:57:07,948 --> 00:57:09,916
Oh, man. AII right, Iook.
How do we get offthis ship?

513
00:57:09,950 --> 00:57:10,917
I don't know.

514
00:57:10,951 --> 00:57:12,919
WeII, Iook, couId...
you beam us offor something?

515
00:57:12,953 --> 00:57:13,920
''Beam us off?. ''

516
00:57:22,096 --> 00:57:22,460
The shuttIe.

517
00:57:24,965 --> 00:57:27,934
HeII, yeah. The shuttIe.
What about it Crutch?

518
00:57:27,968 --> 00:57:30,937
Uh, yeah, I-I can do preIaunch
from the bridge.

519
00:57:31,138 --> 00:57:33,003
Good, good. The rest of us'II head
to the shuttIe.

520
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,941
-We'II start the Iaunch Iist.
-I'm with you, Crutch.

521
00:57:46,987 --> 00:57:48,955
You know how to use that thing?

522
00:57:48,989 --> 00:57:51,958
It'sjust Iike riding a bike. Once
you Iearn, you never forget how.

523
00:57:52,193 --> 00:57:53,922
Good. Kay-Em and I wiII go to
the suppIy hoId.

524
00:57:53,961 --> 00:57:56,953
-Meet you at the shuttIe bay.
-See you there.

525
00:57:58,132 --> 00:57:59,963
What's a bike?

526
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,900
There's enough fire power in here
to IeveI a moon.

527
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:04,905
I say we pack this stuff up
and head for the shuttIe.

528
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:06,907
So, what do you think?
Are we gonna make it?

529
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:09,910
WeII, the statisticaI probabiIity
ofsurvivaI is tweIve percent.

530
00:58:09,977 --> 00:58:13,913
TweIve percent? Can't you come up
with better odds than that?

531
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:14,915
No.

532
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:16,917
BuIIshit, Kay-Em!
That's buIIshit!

533
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:20,921
WeII, preparation for Iaunch may be
a reIativeIy simpIe procedure,

534
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:22,923
but getting there aIive?

535
00:58:22,990 --> 00:58:24,116
It is a probIem.

536
00:58:24,158 --> 00:58:26,922
Are you teIIin' me that there's
absoIuteIy no chance...

537
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:28,929
for us to better our odds?

538
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:39,940
StatisticaI probabiIity ofsurvivaI
just went up to...

539
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:41,942
fifty-three percent.

540
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:44,945
Wanna go for a hundred?

541
00:59:16,043 --> 00:59:17,908
He's here.

542
00:59:17,945 --> 00:59:18,912
Quiet.

543
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:23,074
But if he's in here,
he's gonna kiII us and--

544
00:59:23,117 --> 00:59:26,917
Quiet! One more sound,
and I'II snap your neck myseIf.

545
00:59:27,955 --> 00:59:28,922
Got it?

546
00:59:29,957 --> 00:59:31,925
She's good with peopIe.

547
00:59:33,961 --> 00:59:35,929
-Did you see that?
-What?

548
00:59:35,963 --> 00:59:37,931
I think there's someone stiII
aIive over there.

549
00:59:40,968 --> 00:59:42,936
We don't have time for this.

550
00:59:48,976 --> 00:59:50,944
-Which way is the shuttIe bay?
-Straight through.

551
00:59:51,979 --> 00:59:53,947
Go. I'II meet you there.

552
00:59:57,985 --> 00:59:59,953
Just...don't wreck my pants.

553
01:00:32,186 --> 01:00:34,984
Come on, girI.
We're goin' home.

554
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,007
Ah, Lou.

555
01:00:57,044 --> 01:00:59,012
Jesus, that's twisted.

556
01:01:02,983 --> 01:01:04,951
'Course, I seen worse.

557
01:01:07,988 --> 01:01:09,956
Okay, Iet's get to work.

558
01:01:27,007 --> 01:01:27,974
Brodski?

559
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:38,383
Okay...

560
01:01:39,019 --> 01:01:40,987
we're gonna get ya outta here.

561
01:01:43,023 --> 01:01:43,990
Oh, God.

562
01:01:46,026 --> 01:01:48,995
I'm gonna go get heIp,
and I'II be back.

563
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:01,007
Give me your vest.

564
01:02:03,977 --> 01:02:04,944
Bastard.

565
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:09,949
You're Iucky you weren't aIive
during the Microsoft conflict.

566
01:02:10,117 --> 01:02:12,950
HeII, we were beatin' each other
with our own severed Iimbs.

567
01:02:12,986 --> 01:02:13,953
That's nice.

568
01:02:17,224 --> 01:02:18,953
Let's get us home.

569
01:02:19,993 --> 01:02:20,960
Kinsa, are you there?

570
01:02:20,994 --> 01:02:21,961
Yes, ma'am.

571
01:02:22,996 --> 01:02:23,963
Crutch?

572
01:02:23,997 --> 01:02:26,625
Prepare for fueI transfers.
CeIIs six and seven bypass.

573
01:02:26,667 --> 01:02:28,965
HydrauIic Iifters.

574
01:02:31,004 --> 01:02:32,972
Pressurized and dampened.

575
01:02:34,007 --> 01:02:35,975
-It's Brodski, he's aIive.
-No shit.

576
01:02:36,009 --> 01:02:38,978
Yeah, I-I-I can't move him.
Are Way and Crutch back?

577
01:02:39,012 --> 01:02:40,980
-No, they're stiII on the bridge.
-I need heIp.

578
01:02:41,148 --> 01:02:46,108
Hey, guys. Brodski's stillalive
butRowan can'tmove him byherself.

579
01:02:46,153 --> 01:02:47,984
Go, go, go, go.
I can handIe itfrom here.

580
01:02:48,021 --> 01:02:50,990
TeII 'em I'm on my way.
Watch your back.

581
01:02:53,026 --> 01:02:54,994
Crutch, how are we doing for time?

582
01:02:55,028 --> 01:02:57,997
With a giant shitIoad ofgood Iuck,

583
01:02:58,031 --> 01:03:01,000
we might be ready to go.

584
01:03:01,969 --> 01:03:02,936
Good.

585
01:03:05,939 --> 01:03:06,928
Rowan.

586
01:03:07,975 --> 01:03:08,942
Where's Brodski?

587
01:03:09,977 --> 01:03:11,945
He was here.
I don't get it.

588
01:03:13,113 --> 01:03:15,946
And I am going home.

589
01:03:17,985 --> 01:03:18,952
Lowe!

590
01:03:20,988 --> 01:03:21,955
Oh...shit.

Let's go.

593
01:03:40,007 --> 01:03:40,974
Kinsa, open the door.

594
01:03:41,008 --> 01:03:42,976
Open the damn door!

595
01:03:55,022 --> 01:03:56,990
What's going on?
Why aren't you on board?

596
01:03:57,024 --> 01:03:59,993
Kinsa won't open the door.
I think that she's finaIIy Iost it,

597
01:04:00,027 --> 01:04:01,927
and this is a reaIIy
bad time for this!

598
01:04:01,962 --> 01:04:03,930
Janessa, gentIy. Give me the com.

600
01:04:06,967 --> 01:04:08,935
Kinsa, honey, it's Rowan.
I need you to open the door.

601
01:04:09,970 --> 01:04:10,937
No.

602
01:04:10,971 --> 01:04:13,940
Kinsa, sweetheart, it's aII over,
honey. We can go home.

603
01:04:13,974 --> 01:04:15,942
AII you need to do is open
the door for us.

604
01:04:17,110 --> 01:04:18,099
No.

605
01:04:18,979 --> 01:04:21,948
Oh, shit. Come on, guys. Guys!

606
01:04:21,982 --> 01:04:24,951
Jesus Christ, Kinsa!
Open the goddamn door!

618
01:05:43,997 --> 01:05:45,965

The coIIision must have compromised

641
01:09:23,216 --> 01:09:24,911
Oh, no. No, no... no.

01:09:52,846 --> 01:09:54,939
We don't have that much time.

652
01:09:55,015 --> 01:09:57,848
Tiamat, this is GrendeI. Our huII

We'rejust gonna end up taking
them down with us.

657
01:10:13,133 --> 01:10:13,963
Tiamat...

658
01:10:15,802 --> 01:10:17,963
ifyou can't get here in thirty

Hey, guys, why can't wejust

01:10:35,088 --> 01:10:38,922
-Not ifwe disconnect these waIkways.

ImpossibIe.

682
01:13:42,008 --> 01:13:43,532

723
01:18:23,489 --> 01:18:24,922
Come on.

724
01:18:30,196 --> 01:18:31,891
Tiamat, we're at the evac door.

728
01:18:43,342 --> 01:18:44,934

729
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:48,941

732
01:18:55,054 --> 01:18:56,578
Shit. Oh shit, oh shit.

Come on, come on.

734
01:18:58,791 --> 01:19:01,885
Our exterior motor's got no power.

735
01:19:01,928 --> 01:19:04,897
-What does that mean?
-Means I'm going EVA.

736
01:19:06,132 --> 01:19:08,794
-EVA? What's EVA?
-It's a space waIk.

737
01:19:08,835 --> 01:19:10,894
I-If he can jump the Iines out there
we can reroute them from in here.

738
01:19:11,304 --> 01:19:13,829

739
01:19:13,873 --> 01:19:14,464
it bIows the heII up.

740
01:19:14,507 --> 01:19:15,906
Sounds Iike a good pIan.

741
01:19:15,942 --> 01:19:17,910
Tiamat, this is GrendeI.
Our escape hatch isjammed.

742
01:19:18,010 --> 01:19:20,911
-We're goin' EVA to try to patch it up.
-You'd better get a move on.

743
01:19:29,021 --> 01:19:29,919
I'm in the maintenance hatch.

744
01:19:29,956 --> 01:19:31,924
We read you, sarge.

745
01:19:32,024 --> 01:19:33,924
Opening outer doors.

746
01:19:45,905 --> 01:19:47,930
Those hatches aren't gonna keep
him that much Ionger.

747
01:19:47,974 --> 01:19:49,942
We need to buy more time.

748
01:19:51,511 --> 01:19:53,945
You're the expert on this guy, right?

749
01:19:54,180 --> 01:19:57,946
-What are you thinking?
-A diversion.

750
01:20:16,335 --> 01:20:17,962
I'm at the controI paneIs.

751
01:20:22,909 --> 01:20:23,967
Rowan, are you there?

752
01:20:25,077 --> 01:20:25,975
Yes.

753
01:20:26,012 --> 01:20:28,981
I'm gonna divert the main power
suppIy unit and send it to you.

754
01:20:29,148 --> 01:20:29,978
Gotcha.

755
01:20:31,017 --> 01:20:32,985
See the bright bIue diode?

756
01:20:33,085 --> 01:20:34,985
Connectit to the terminal.

757
01:20:37,156 --> 01:20:38,987
Uh, was that you or me?

758
01:20:50,036 --> 01:20:51,663
That was another part ofyour huII,
GrendeI.

759
01:20:51,771 --> 01:20:53,534
You are running out oftime.

760
01:20:53,706 --> 01:20:55,571
Okay,Tiamat.
Just a few more minutes.

761
01:20:55,608 --> 01:20:57,542
We can disengage and come around
again.

762
01:20:57,577 --> 01:21:00,011
Negative, Tiamat.
Just another minute.

763
01:21:01,447 --> 01:21:03,938
We'II stand by as Iong as we can.

764
01:21:20,132 --> 01:21:22,600
-You ready, Kay?
-I was buiIt ready, baby.

01:22:24,030 --> 01:22:25,964
-Whoops.
-What do you mean, ''Whoops''?

768
01:22:26,999 --> 01:22:27,966
Nothing.

769
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,628
Not nothing. You don'tjust say
''oops.'' What ''oops''?

770
01:22:31,203 --> 01:22:32,966
I think he saw me.

771
01:22:33,940 --> 01:22:36,966
Oh, man. Ifyou've got something

775
01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:45,978

01:22:46,052 --> 01:22:48,987
-Here goes nothin'.

777
01:22:53,025 --> 01:22:56,984
-Hey... you want a beer?

778
01:22:57,029 --> 01:22:59,998
