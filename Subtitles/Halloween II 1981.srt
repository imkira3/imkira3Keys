I want you to listen to me.
I want you to go out of the house
and down the street to the MacKenzies' house.

3
00:00:57,343 --> 00:00:58,907
I want you to knock on their door.

4
00:00:59,012 --> 00:01:02,140
I want you to tell them to call the police
and send'em over here.

5
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:03,496
All right?

6
00:01:03,704 --> 00:01:05,477
Laurie. - Do as I say.
- Yeah.

7
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:08,502
Go.

8
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,859
Get help!

9
00:01:31,962 --> 00:01:33,005
Come on!

10
00:01:33,422 --> 00:01:34,465
Come on!

11
00:02:04,497 --> 00:02:05,853
Oh, no.

12
00:02:15,758 --> 00:02:16,906
Help!

13
00:02:49,022 --> 00:02:50,899
It was the boogeyman.

14
00:02:56,321 --> 00:02:57,781
As a matter of fact ...

15
00:02:57,989 --> 00:02:59,241
it was.

16
00:03:55,132 --> 00:03:56,696
What's going on out here?

17
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,843
Call the police!

18
00:03:57,947 --> 00:03:59,512
Tell the sheriff I shot him!

19
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,137
Who?

20
00:04:00,346 --> 00:04:03,786
Tell him he's still on the loose!
- Is this some kind of joke?

21
00:04:03,891 --> 00:04:06,393
I've been trick-or-treated to death tonight!

22
00:04:06,915 --> 00:04:08,688
You don't know what death is!

23
00:07:39,114 --> 00:07:40,887
Trick or treat.

24
00:08:04,453 --> 00:08:06,433
I shot him six times!

25
00:08:06,642 --> 00:08:09,562
What?
- I shot him six times!

26
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,647
I ... I shot him in the heart and ...

27
00:08:11,856 --> 00:08:15,506
He cannot get a very far, come on.
- I shot him six times!

28
00:08:15,715 --> 00:08:16,861
This guy ...

29
00:08:18,112 --> 00:08:19,676
he's not human!

30
00:08:43,034 --> 00:08:45,537
Harold, you want mayonnaise on your sandwich?

31
00:08:51,584 --> 00:08:52,940
How about mustard?

32
00:08:53,983 --> 00:09:00,135
{y:i}Up next some more spine melting madness
{y:i}"Night of the Living Dead"
- Are you asleep again?

33
00:09:10,876 --> 00:09:13,587

34
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:19,634
{y:i}Police in Haddonfield have just made the grisly discovery
{y:i}of three bodies in the upstairs bedrooms of this house.

35
00:09:19,843 --> 00:09:23,180
{y:i}It appears that the murders took
{y:i}place some time early this evening.

36
00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:26,829

00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:35,589
{y:i}Police are searching the entire area for a middle patient,
{y:i}who escaped last night from the Smith's Grow
{y:i}Warren county sanitorium.

39
00:09:35,693 --> 00:09:38,403
{y:i}He is now believed to be at large in Haddonfield.

40
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:40,489
{y:i}This is Robert Mundy ... live.

41
00:09:45,599 --> 00:09:50,291
{y:i}They're coming to get you Barbara.

42
00:09:50,499 --> 00:09:54,045
{y:i}You're ignorant.
{y:i}- They're coming for you, Barbara.

43
00:09:54,566 --> 00:09:57,173
{y:i}Stop it. You're acting like a child.

44
00:09:57,382 --> 00:09:58,842
{y:i}They're coming for you.

45
00:09:59,363 --> 00:09:59,781
{y:i}Look ...

46
00:09:59,885 --> 00:10:01,761
{y:i}There comes one of them now.

47
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,055
{y:i}She'll hear you.
{y:i}Here he comes now.

48
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,724
{y:i}I'm gettitng out of here.

49
00:10:27,204 --> 00:10:28,768
Mrs. Elrod?!

50
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,584
Mr. Elrod?

51
00:10:33,878 --> 00:10:35,546
Are you ok?

52
00:10:48,685 --> 00:10:49,727
Hi.

53
00:10:50,145 --> 00:10:52,543
There was someone screaming next door.

54
00:10:52,856 --> 00:10:55,150
Yeah, Mr. a Mrs. Elrod.

55
00:10:55,463 --> 00:10:57,653
His wife's always picking on him.

56
00:10:57,862 --> 00:11:00,989
He probably got angry and decided to start beating her.

57
00:11:03,492 --> 00:11:05,265
Ok, deal.

58
00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:06,829
{y:i}Are your folks home?

59
00:11:07,038 --> 00:11:08,915
They are gone.

60
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:13,919
My dad had to take my Aunt Ruby to Harden County
and my mother's decided to go along.

61
00:11:14,024 --> 00:11:15,275
{y:i}Didn't you hear?

62
00:11:15,588 --> 00:11:16,735

63
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:19,029
{y:i}Some girl got killed in Haddonfield.

64
00:11:19,133 --> 00:11:20,698
{y:i}It's on the radio.

65
00:11:21,323 --> 00:11:22,261
Hold on.

66
00:11:24,347 --> 00:11:26,954
{y:i}... and the police have curtain off the entire area

67
00:11:27,058 --> 00:11:27,788

{y:i}in the house in the Northwest section of Haddonfield.

69
00:11:32,481 --> 00:11:35,608
{y:i}The names of the teenagers have not been released ...
- I can't believe it.

70
00:11:35,713 --> 00:11:36,547
{y:i}I know.

71
00:11:36,651 --> 00:11:38,841
{y:i}You know we probably knew her.
- Where did it happen?

72
00:11:38,945 --> 00:11:40,510
{y:i}Down on Orange Grove.

73
00:11:41,448 --> 00:11:43,951
That's right down the street.
{y:i}- I know.

74
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:48,538
{y:i}Police confirmed the girl was rescued that she ...
- Sally, I can hear the sirens coming.

75
00:11:48,747 --> 00:11:50,207
{y:i}They said the guy got away.

76
00:11:50,728 --> 00:11:52,293
Do they know who it was?
{y:i}- No.

77
00:11:53,753 --> 00:11:55,213
Oh, god.

78
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,506
{y:i}Alice?

79
00:11:57,923 --> 00:11:58,861
{y:i}Alice ...

80
00:12:00,217 --> 00:12:01,051
{y:i}Talk ...

81
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,511
{y:i}Haddonfield police is ...

83
00:12:05,431 --> 00:12:08,663

- Where are you?
{y:i}... the main streets in town.

84
00:12:08,767 --> 00:12:14,190
Who is it?
{y:i}Chief to the Haddonfield police department says.
{y:i}He believe that suspect will be apprehended ...

85
00:12:14,294 --> 00:12:15,859
{y:i}within a matter of hours.

86
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:22,010
{y:i}Neighboor say they heard scream during the early evening,
{y:i}but activity a noise it's for usual haloween.

87
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:47,037
I came out on the lawn.
I asked him what was going on.

88
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,809
He said ...
- Inside you guys.

89
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,791
He said he'd shot somebody.

90
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,594
All right folks. Give'em a room, please?

91
00:13:48,872 --> 00:13:49,810
Laurie?

92
00:13:49,915 --> 00:13:52,312
Can you hear me?
- Don't let them put me to sleep.

93
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:56,692
It's all right, take it easy. We're gonna go to clinic, all right?
- Don't let them put me to sleep. - It's ok.

94
00:14:05,764 --> 00:14:06,494
Hey ...

95
00:14:06,598 --> 00:14:07,328
you know this chick?

96
00:14:09,309 --> 00:14:10,874
Yeh, her name's Laurie Strode.

97
00:14:11,186 --> 00:14:12,855
She goes to school with my little brother Ziggy.

98
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,670
Her old man ... eh Strode Realty?
- Yeah.

99
00:14:15,774 --> 00:14:16,817
Ook.

100
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:37,047
Ok, just get out easy.

101
00:14:37,464 --> 00:14:38,401
It's gonna be ok.

102
00:14:38,506 --> 00:14:40,487
Just walk real slow, ok?

103
00:14:41,009 --> 00:14:43,511
Are you all right?
Are you all right, hon?

104
00:14:45,806 --> 00:14:47,161
Oh, god.

105
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:53,104
Here. Just ... just put it up there real gently.
You ok? Let's go. Just walk real slow. Come on.

106
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:55,878
Fill out this form. Someone will be with you in a moment.
- Well, we should see the doctor right away.

107
00:15:55,982 --> 00:15:58,590
He's with a patient. Would you please wait in room "A"?

108
00:15:59,007 --> 00:16:00,674
Come on honey. Thank you.

109
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:04,533
Where's Doc. Mixter?

110
00:16:04,741 --> 00:16:06,514
He's been at the country club. I think he's drunk.

111
00:16:06,723 --> 00:16:07,870
Oh, great.

112
00:16:08,287 --> 00:16:09,017
What've we got?

113
00:16:09,225 --> 00:16:15,899
Stub wound, left anterior chest, possibly penetrating.
Multiple ... - It's Laurie Strode. Come on, let's go.
... fractured right ankle.

114
00:16:16,733 --> 00:16:18,193
Janet, get me some more coffee.

115
00:16:18,297 --> 00:16:19,861
Get that out of here.

116
00:16:22,885 --> 00:16:24,136
Oh, Laurie.

117
00:16:24,657 --> 00:16:25,700
Hi there.

118
00:16:26,326 --> 00:16:29,037
Well let's see what we have here.

119
00:16:29,142 --> 00:16:30,393
Ah yes ...

120
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:32,479
you lost a lot of blood.

121
00:16:33,417 --> 00:16:34,876
We'll need to a type it.

122
00:16:38,943 --> 00:16:41,968
When was the last time you had a tetatus shot?

123
00:16:42,489 --> 00:16:43,740
I don't know.

124
00:16:49,996 --> 00:16:51,143
Get me some ...

125
00:16:51,248 --> 00:16:53,751
3.0 nylon on ...
- Cutting needle?

126
00:16:53,855 --> 00:16:54,898
- Yes.
- Right away.

127
00:16:55,106 --> 00:16:57,088
We're going to have to put her out.
- No!

128
00:16:57,504 --> 00:16:59,902
No, don't put me to sleep.
- Ok, relax.

129
00:17:00,007 --> 00:17:01,362
Nylon's not gonna hurt you.

130
00:17:01,467 --> 00:17:02,614
No.

131
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:06,681
Please don't put me to sleep.

132
00:17:09,183 --> 00:17:10,330
Take it easy.

133
00:17:15,231 --> 00:17:16,795
Try to relax, Laurie.

134
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:21,487
Doctor Mixter have you stitched up in no time.

135
00:17:22,113 --> 00:17:23,781
Take it easy, Laurie.

136
00:17:26,075 --> 00:17:27,953
Circle the block again.

137
00:17:29,517 --> 00:17:30,664
How long now?

138
00:17:30,768 --> 00:17:32,749
It's about 30 minutes. Put light down there.

139
00:17:32,853 --> 00:17:34,521
There, by those trees.

140
00:17:34,939 --> 00:17:36,607
There is nothing.

141
00:17:36,711 --> 00:17:38,276
Well, keep going.

142
00:17:38,901 --> 00:17:41,300
You know Doctor, I'm just about there.

143
00:17:41,404 --> 00:17:42,238
What?

144
00:17:42,447 --> 00:17:45,157
The point where I stop taking orders from you.

145
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,390
Alright sheriff whatever you want.

146
00:17:48,494 --> 00:17:50,997
The primary concern is that we stop him.

147
00:17:51,414 --> 00:17:52,770
You let him out.

148
00:17:52,874 --> 00:17:55,480
I didn't.
- His own goddamn doctor.

149
00:17:55,585 --> 00:17:57,462
I didn't let him out.

150
00:17:57,775 --> 00:17:59,443
{y:i}Hey Brackett come in please...

151
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,633
{y:i}Hey Brackett come in please ...

152
00:18:01,737 --> 00:18:02,467
Who is it?

153
00:18:02,676 --> 00:18:04,240
{y:i}Geez, this is amsey.

154
00:18:04,449 --> 00:18:05,700
Say again, what is it?

155
00:18:05,805 --> 00:18:06,846
{y:i}This is Ramsey.

156
00:18:07,472 --> 00:18:08,306
Where are you?

157
00:18:08,411 --> 00:18:12,999
{y:i}I'm out by the bakery moving north on the Scottsville road.
- Get the hell back in the town.

158
00:18:13,103 --> 00:18:15,919
Go up 17th street, meet me by the bypass.

159
00:18:16,023 --> 00:18:17,900
{y:i}10 - 4 Ramsey clear.

160
00:18:18,525 --> 00:18:20,402
Will you put that thing away!

161
00:18:22,592 --> 00:18:24,678
You couldn't have shot him six times!

162
00:18:24,991 --> 00:18:27,911
You think I'm lying, sherif.
- I think you missed him.

163
00:18:28,015 --> 00:18:31,455
No man could take six shots.
- I've told you this isn't a man.

164
00:18:32,707 --> 00:18:36,252
Look out! Slow down!
- Why? - Over there! Look, look, look!

165
00:18:39,381 --> 00:18:40,215
Is that him?

166
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,570
I don't know.

167
00:18:44,073 --> 00:18:44,594
Get back!

168
00:18:44,803 --> 00:18:46,367
Run! Come on, run!

169
00:18:46,471 --> 00:18:47,410
Loomis!

170
00:18:47,618 --> 00:18:48,557
Get back!

171
00:18:49,287 --> 00:18:51,477
Get back you kids!
- Loomis!

172
00:18:51,581 --> 00:18:53,353
Stop! ... Get out!
- Loomis!

173
00:18:54,187 --> 00:18:54,917
Loomis!

174
00:18:55,021 --> 00:18:56,064
Stop!

175
00:18:58,359 --> 00:18:59,401
Stop!

176
00:19:00,027 --> 00:19:00,966
Don't shoot!

177
00:19:02,217 --> 00:19:03,677
Stop!
- Don't kill him!

178
00:19:15,564 --> 00:19:17,128
Oh, sheriff Brackett.

179
00:19:19,213 --> 00:19:20,465
He came out of nowhere.

180
00:19:20,569 --> 00:19:21,925
I couldn't stop.

181
00:19:22,133 --> 00:19:23,072
Is it him?!

182
00:19:28,181 --> 00:19:29,953
Is it him or not!?

183
00:19:37,149 --> 00:19:37,983
Leigh ...

184
00:19:39,442 --> 00:19:41,528
We've been found three bodies.
- Where?

185
00:19:41,841 --> 00:19:43,822
Across the street from the Doyle house.

186
00:19:44,031 --> 00:19:45,491
Three kids ...

187
00:19:46,221 --> 00:19:47,994
Leigh...
one of them was Annie!

188
00:19:48,098 --> 00:19:49,141
What?

189
00:19:59,985 --> 00:20:01,549
Does it hurt a lot?

190
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,634
What?

191
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:09,370
Oh sweetie, I can't understand you. Look, it'll be ok.
We'll play some games tonight and ...

192
00:20:09,578 --> 00:20:11,768
{y:i}Repeating for those of you who just tuned in.

193
00:20:11,872 --> 00:20:13,749
{y:i}Three people are dead tonight ...

194
00:20:13,853 --> 00:20:17,086
{y:i}as a resolve an attack by an escaped mental patient.

195
00:20:17,294 --> 00:20:19,901
{y:i}I understand we're going to stay on the air now?

196
00:20:20,006 --> 00:20:22,404
{y:i}Repeating for those of you who just tuned in.

197
00:20:22,613 --> 00:20:24,490
{y:i}Three people are dead tonight ...

198
00:20:24,594 --> 00:20:27,826
{y:i}as a resolve an attack by an escaped mental patient.

199
00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:31,893
{y:i}Any further details will be report coming
{y:i}as soon as we get them.

200
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:33,874
{y:i}This is Robert Munday ...

201
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,647
{y:i}reporting you live.

202
00:21:07,451 --> 00:21:08,598
Hi ...

203
00:21:09,432 --> 00:21:10,788
Hi.

204
00:21:12,664 --> 00:21:13,498
Jimmy ...

205
00:21:15,897 --> 00:21:17,044
Oh, how are you feeling?

206
00:21:18,191 --> 00:21:19,547
Sore.

207
00:21:21,736 --> 00:21:22,988
What happened?

208
00:21:23,092 --> 00:21:24,343
Cracked the bone.

209
00:21:24,968 --> 00:21:26,220
Lucky it wasn't a break.

210
00:21:26,324 --> 00:21:30,287
Doctor Mixter felt that he should wait untill tomorrow,
before he put cast on.

211
00:21:30,808 --> 00:21:32,060
You have to get some rest.

212
00:21:33,937 --> 00:21:35,083
Come on, Jimmy.

213
00:21:44,155 --> 00:21:46,449
Can I get you something to drink or anything?

214
00:21:47,492 --> 00:21:48,743
How about a coke?

215
00:21:49,264 --> 00:21:50,307
Ok.

216
00:21:50,933 --> 00:21:52,080
Thanks.

217
00:21:52,393 --> 00:21:53,227
Ok.

218
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:53,853
Come on!

219
00:21:53,957 --> 00:21:56,564
Jimmy, we've got to roll. Another call came in.
- Ok.

220
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,232
I'll get you that coke later.

221
00:21:59,066 --> 00:22:00,005
Out.

222
00:22:03,342 --> 00:22:06,992
Moments ago police reported that Michael Myers,
formerly of Haddonfield,

223
00:22:07,096 --> 00:22:12,205
who fled the Smith's Grove Warren county Sanitarium
last night was believed to have burned to death.

224
00:22:12,309 --> 00:22:16,793
Meanwhile, three bodies were discovered
in the upstairs bedroom of the house directly behind me.

225
00:22:16,898 --> 00:22:20,443
Identification of the victims is being witheld.
Pending notification of their families ...

226
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:23,258
Forget that. forget that.
I wanna concentrate on that house.

227
00:22:23,362 --> 00:22:26,178
Talk to some kids. See if anybody saw anything.

228
00:22:26,282 --> 00:22:31,392
You need the parent's permission to use a statement.
If you can't find the parents, get a statement anyway.

229
00:22:33,581 --> 00:22:34,728
Not now ...

230
00:22:40,881 --> 00:22:42,132
Give us a minute, fellas.

231
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:14,040
I .. uh

232
00:23:15,396 --> 00:23:20,922
have to ... go and tell my wife,
before somebody else does.

233
00:23:23,007 --> 00:23:24,676
Go on home, Leigh.

234
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,179
Go on home, I'll take care of everything.

235
00:23:27,492 --> 00:23:33,018
Damn you! - I'm sorrry. -What have you done?
- I haven't done anything. - YOU LET HIM OUT!

236
00:23:33,226 --> 00:23:36,563
I didn't let him out.
I gave orders for him to be restrained.

237
00:23:37,606 --> 00:23:40,422
Now is there anything else, that we can do for you?

238
00:23:40,735 --> 00:23:44,592
If that wasn't Michael Myers burning up in that car ...

239
00:23:44,696 --> 00:23:48,242
then lot of other kids are gonna be slaugtered tonight.
- He's dead.

240
00:23:48,451 --> 00:23:50,536
I saw him.
- You saw man at the mask.

241
00:23:50,641 --> 00:23:55,958
It was him. - I wanna believe you,
but I gotta be sure.
I can't stop, untill I'm certain it's dead.

242
00:23:56,167 --> 00:24:02,215
You talk about him like he's some kind of animal.
- He was my ... - Would you keep it back?!
He was my patient for fifteen years ...

243
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:08,158
He became an obsession with me, until I realized,
that there was nothing within.
Neither consciance nor reason that was ...

244
00:24:08,262 --> 00:24:10,765
even remotely human.

245
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:16,188
An hour ago I stood up and fired six shots into him
and he just got up and walked away.

246
00:24:16,292 --> 00:24:20,984
I am talking about the real possibility,
that he is STILL OUT THERE!

247
00:24:22,235 --> 00:24:23,591
Where'd they take the body?

248
00:24:23,904 --> 00:24:25,155
The Coroner's office.

249
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,867
Get a dentist to meet me there in half an hour.

250
00:24:39,128 --> 00:24:44,342
{y:i}Despite the fact that the man, who rescued Laurie Strode,
{y:i}claims to have shot him six times at close range.

251
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,887
{y:i}Haddonfield police have no explanation
{y:i}for the suspect's disappearance ...

252
00:24:48,096 --> 00:24:52,996
{y:i}But say they're confident, he will be captured soon.
- I cannot believe it.
{y:i}Paramedics are now removing the last of the bodies.

253
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:57,063
Pin the tail on the donkey and bobbing for apples.
Actually bobbing for water. No less.

254
00:24:57,167 --> 00:25:03,528
Well you gotta use water to see if you don't ...
- I am never going to another halloween party
as long as I live. Especially not at Stevie Mather's house.

255
00:25:03,632 --> 00:25:05,196
And of course now I'm gonna be late.

256
00:25:05,301 --> 00:25:07,178
Oh, you gotta drive me home first.

257
00:25:07,386 --> 00:25:09,993
Oh Darcy, I don't have time.
- You've got to.

258
00:25:11,245 --> 00:25:13,122
Oh, can't you ask Eddie Lee?

259
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:15,102
He's in Russelville.

260
00:25:15,937 --> 00:25:20,734
It's five minutes to your house another five minutes
back to the hospital. Mrs. Alves's gonna kill me.

261
00:25:21,985 --> 00:25:23,236
You promised me.

262
00:25:25,739 --> 00:25:27,615
I know I did.

263
00:25:50,869 --> 00:25:52,537
{y:i}One survivor ...

264
00:25:52,641 --> 00:25:58,064
{y:i}17- year  old Laurie Strode was found directly across
{y:i}the street from the home, where the murders took place.

265
00:25:58,168 --> 00:26:03,486
{y:i}The teenager was taken across town to
{y:i}Haddonfield Memorial Clinic. Paramedics on the scene ...

266
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:30,347
{y:i}In of aftermath of the killings the streets between
{y:i}Chestnut and tenth third jamed with people and ... cars.

267
00:27:31,181 --> 00:27:32,016
{y:i}Repeating ...

268
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:37,229
{y:i}that a ... These streets a Chestnut and tenth
{y:i}there are just jamed with both people ...

269
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:39,523
Well, I sure could go for a pizza now.

270
00:27:40,462 --> 00:27:43,694
Nice be with sausage, onions, peppers ...

271
00:27:45,049 --> 00:27:46,822
But no mushrooms. I hate mushrooms.

272
00:27:47,448 --> 00:27:52,662
{y:i}The names of young victims are not yet released,
{y:i}but people would probably recognized,
{y:i}that is neighbourhood teenagers.

273
00:27:52,766 --> 00:27:55,060
Looks like a goddamn homecoming.

274
00:27:59,335 --> 00:28:00,169
{y:i}Now ...

275
00:28:00,274 --> 00:28:01,108
{y:i}back ...

276
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:02,881
{y:i}to Dementia ...

277
00:28:32,703 --> 00:28:34,058
Thanks, Mr. Garret.

278
00:28:40,524 --> 00:28:42,297
Julie saw him you know.

279
00:28:43,651 --> 00:28:44,486
Who?

280
00:28:44,903 --> 00:28:46,571
Michael Myers.

281
00:28:46,676 --> 00:28:47,927
Come on.

282
00:28:48,031 --> 00:28:50,117
I swear. Yesterday, when she was coming to work.

283
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:51,786
Where did she see him?

284
00:28:52,828 --> 00:28:54,913
Near the shop and bag out by the mall.

285
00:28:55,643 --> 00:28:57,103
Well, she stopped at the light ...

286
00:28:57,312 --> 00:29:00,544
and saw him walk in that field
behind the Lost River Dive in.

287
00:29:02,213 --> 00:29:05,446
Julie said he was so creepy.
- Julie's full of shit.

288
00:29:05,654 --> 00:29:07,635
He didn't escape until last night.

289
00:29:10,138 --> 00:29:11,702
Well you don't have to swear, Budd.

290
00:29:11,806 --> 00:29:13,996
She's a goddamn moron anyway.

291
00:29:14,309 --> 00:29:17,332
Every other word you say is either hell or shit or damn.

292
00:29:18,584 --> 00:29:19,626
I'm sorry.

293
00:29:20,252 --> 00:29:22,233
I guess I just fuck up all the time.

294
00:29:34,642 --> 00:29:35,476
Hi.

295
00:29:38,709 --> 00:29:39,544
Hey, you're here.

296
00:29:39,648 --> 00:29:40,274
Hi.

297
00:29:40,481 --> 00:29:41,211
You're late.

298
00:29:41,315 --> 00:29:43,818
Yea I know, I've got to get on the ward.

299
00:29:44,548 --> 00:29:45,278
Hi. Jimmy.

300
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,364
Oh, hi. Karen.

301
00:29:52,368 --> 00:29:53,516
Come on.

302
00:29:54,454 --> 00:29:55,705
See you later.

303
00:29:55,914 --> 00:29:56,644
Great.

304
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,110
* Amazing grace ... *

305
00:30:03,527 --> 00:30:06,029
* come sit on my face *

306
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:08,844
* Don't make me cry ... *

307
00:30:08,948 --> 00:30:10,826
* I need your pie *

308
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:12,911
Look, why don't you just shut up, all right?

309
00:30:13,641 --> 00:30:14,997
What do you all worked up about?

310
00:30:15,101 --> 00:30:16,352
Look it could be Ziggy, you know?

311
00:30:16,456 --> 00:30:18,854
It could've been your brother Mark,
we pulled out of there.

312
00:30:18,959 --> 00:30:20,732
All right, so what do you want me to do?

313
00:30:21,774 --> 00:30:22,400
Look Jimmy ...

314
00:30:22,609 --> 00:30:25,320
Rule number one: never get involved with a patient.

315
00:30:25,946 --> 00:30:26,883
Nurses ...

316
00:30:27,196 --> 00:30:28,656
that's another story.

317
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,367
But patients is no good. It never works out.

318
00:30:32,827 --> 00:30:34,600
Where you going college boy?

319
00:30:35,017 --> 00:30:36,999
I'm telling you, listen to old Budd.

320
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,947
You were late again tonight.

321
00:31:51,346 --> 00:31:52,806
Just fifteen minutes.

322
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:56,247
That could be the difference
between life and death for one of those kids.

323
00:31:57,707 --> 00:32:01,043
You're right. I'm sorry Mrs. Alves.
- I don't wanna hear any excuses.

324
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,920
You're a good nurse Karen.

325
00:32:03,025 --> 00:32:03,859
I'd hate to loose you.

326
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,840
But you've got to learn to be on time.

327
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,509
Now. Let's get over this list.

328
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,637
I'll be fine, really. I'm sorry. I promise.
- Ok..

329
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:13,139
Carr ...

330
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,434
Mrs. Carr, 9:30 tommorow morning.

331
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:16,685
God, they should have ...

332
00:32:16,789 --> 00:32:18,771
They should have handled him more carefully.

333
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:20,648
Who?

334
00:32:22,316 --> 00:32:23,671
Michael Myers.

335
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:27,321
Michael Myers?

336
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:29,407
Yea, he ...

337
00:32:29,511 --> 00:32:30,867
He was that guy, that was after you.

338
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:36,393
You mean the Myers house?

339
00:32:39,834 --> 00:32:42,545
That little kid who killed his sister?
- Yea.

340
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:48,176
But he's in a hospital somewhere.

341
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,053
He escaped last night.

342
00:32:50,366 --> 00:32:51,408
How do you know?

343
00:32:52,034 --> 00:32:53,494
It's all over the radio.

344
00:32:53,598 --> 00:32:55,788
Television too. It's on right now.

345
00:33:01,731 --> 00:33:02,983
Why me?

346
00:33:05,486 --> 00:33:07,154
I mean, why me?

347
00:33:09,865 --> 00:33:11,325
Times up Jimmy.

348
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:13,306
Let's go.

349
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:14,453
OK. ok.

350
00:33:19,667 --> 00:33:20,918
No you won't!

351
00:33:21,126 --> 00:33:23,212
Visiting hours are definitely over.

352
00:33:26,966 --> 00:33:29,782
Men ... you can't live with'em,
you can't live without'em.

353
00:33:30,616 --> 00:33:32,284
How's that shoulder feel?

354
00:33:33,222 --> 00:33:34,369
A little better.

355
00:33:34,578 --> 00:33:35,621
Good.

356
00:33:36,142 --> 00:33:38,436
We've been trying to get ahold of your parents.

357
00:33:39,166 --> 00:33:43,649
Dr. Mixter told me, they were at the same party he was,
but they're not there now and they're not at home.

358
00:33:43,962 --> 00:33:45,944
Do you have any idea of where else they might be?

359
00:33:47,404 --> 00:33:48,342
No.

360
00:33:49,489 --> 00:33:51,054
I'll just keep trying.

361
00:34:01,794 --> 00:34:02,941
Oh, this is just ...

362
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:05,652
Janet?

363
00:34:08,988 --> 00:34:10,136
Yes Mrs. Alves.

364
00:34:10,344 --> 00:34:12,534
Go tell Mr. Garrett, we're having trouble with the phones.

365
00:34:12,638 --> 00:34:13,890
Right now.

366
00:34:14,515 --> 00:34:16,705
He's at the other end of the hall.
- Janet.

367
00:34:17,748 --> 00:34:19,311
Yes, Mrs. Alves.

368
00:34:22,231 --> 00:34:23,796
What's wrong with the phones?

369
00:34:25,777 --> 00:34:27,654
Nothing for you to worry about.

370
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,052
Just get some rest right now.

371
00:34:30,365 --> 00:34:32,867
I'll let you know as soon as we get ahold of your parents.

372
00:35:01,856 --> 00:35:03,316
I'm gonna go check the phone.

373
00:35:03,525 --> 00:35:06,027
You wait here and I'll call you.
- I have to get back on the floor!

374
00:35:06,235 --> 00:35:10,094
It'll take me five minutes.
- But I don't even know, how to use this thing!

375
00:38:09,863 --> 00:38:13,930
I think somebody broke into the store room.
{y:i}The lock was off.

376
00:38:18,414 --> 00:38:19,665
Mr. Garrett?

377
00:38:20,604 --> 00:38:22,167
I can't hear you.

378
00:38:24,044 --> 00:38:27,486
One of you had better drive down
to the sherif's station right away.

379
00:38:33,324 --> 00:38:35,827
Mr. Garrett, how do you work this thing?

380
00:38:35,931 --> 00:38:36,974
Janet!

381
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,380
Mr. Garrett.

382
00:40:05,712 --> 00:40:06,963
Mr. Garrett?

383
00:40:10,509 --> 00:40:13,429
Mr. Garrett ... I gotta get back on the floor.

384
00:40:16,869 --> 00:40:17,912
Hello?

385
00:40:34,075 --> 00:40:35,431
It's difficult.

386
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:37,829
Even the gums are charred but ...

387
00:40:38,142 --> 00:40:39,185
... look here.

388
00:40:40,957 --> 00:40:41,999
See here?

389
00:40:42,417 --> 00:40:43,876
No fillings.

390
00:40:44,085 --> 00:40:47,422
He's young. Maybe seventeen, maybe eighteen.

391
00:40:47,631 --> 00:40:49,404
Michael Myers is 21.

392
00:40:50,029 --> 00:40:53,052
Positive ID means we check x-rays and dental records.

393
00:40:53,157 --> 00:40:54,617
That'll take hours!

394
00:40:54,721 --> 00:40:58,058
No other way to know for sure. I'm sorry.
- We haven't got hours.

395
00:40:58,162 --> 00:41:01,812
Listen to me. We've got to assume,
that Michael Myers is still alive.

396
00:41:06,504 --> 00:41:07,964
Everybody goes back out.

397
00:41:08,068 --> 00:41:09,320
But we just closed it up.

398
00:41:09,424 --> 00:41:12,552
I want to sweep from Chestnut South to the bypass.

399
00:41:12,657 --> 00:41:13,700
I want every street ...

400
00:41:13,908 --> 00:41:15,159
every house ...

401
00:41:15,784 --> 00:41:17,453
every backyard.

402
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:19,121
Ok.

403
00:41:19,434 --> 00:41:20,581
You've got it.

404
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,420
Thank you.

405
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:42,687
All right, that's enough. That's enough!
Now come on, get out of here. You guys, go home.
Michael Myers not here.

406
00:41:51,968 --> 00:41:57,182
This is Hunt in another vehicle.
The old Myers house 45 Lampkin Ln. - The tribe.

407
00:41:57,703 --> 00:42:00,622
One of their number was butchered, this is a wake.

408
00:42:07,088 --> 00:42:09,382
Heightens my sense of security.

409
00:42:22,938 --> 00:42:24,710
All right. Knock it off!

410
00:42:25,857 --> 00:42:28,047
Come on folks, go home.

411
00:42:29,194 --> 00:42:30,550
Knock it off!!!

412
00:42:33,782 --> 00:42:34,617
Empty.

413
00:42:34,721 --> 00:42:37,744
Plus we've covered the whole east end of town.
There's nothing.

414
00:42:37,848 --> 00:42:38,787
Check it again.

415
00:42:38,996 --> 00:42:40,456
He just isn't here.

416
00:42:40,664 --> 00:42:42,020
CHECK IT again!

417
00:42:44,106 --> 00:42:44,940
You know.

418
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:48,276
Haddonfield was a pretty quiet town before tonight.

419
00:42:48,484 --> 00:42:49,423
The only a ...

420
00:42:49,632 --> 00:42:51,509
gunshot you ever heard

421
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:54,220
were start tracking for the local highschool.

422
00:42:54,533 --> 00:42:57,661
Yet one night in 1963 Michael Myers ...

423
00:42:58,183 --> 00:43:01,519
did murder his sister
in that upstairs bedroom with a large ...

424
00:43:01,727 --> 00:43:03,083
butcher knife.

425
00:43:03,605 --> 00:43:04,856
I remember.

426
00:43:05,065 --> 00:43:07,776
On halloween.
- I was sixteen years old.

427
00:43:08,297 --> 00:43:10,486
It's his anniversary, Mr. Hunt.

428
00:43:11,738 --> 00:43:12,989
He came back.

429
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:15,388
After fifteen years?

430
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:18,412
He waited with extraordinary patience,

431
00:43:19,872 --> 00:43:20,810
There was a ...

432
00:43:20,915 --> 00:43:23,729
force inside him biding its time.

433
00:43:24,668 --> 00:43:28,839
The stuff grew accustomed to his immobility and silence.

434
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:33,427
In many ways he was the ideal patient.
He didn't talked he didn't ...

435
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:36,242
cry. He didn't even move.

436
00:43:36,555 --> 00:43:38,119
He just waited.

437
00:43:38,745 --> 00:43:41,248
The staff was unprepared they didn't ...

438
00:43:41,769 --> 00:43:43,855
know, what he was.

439
00:43:44,481 --> 00:43:45,731
Did you know?

440
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:47,921
Yea I knew.

441
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:49,068
Excuse me.

442
00:43:49,694 --> 00:43:50,632
Mr. Hunt?

443
00:43:51,467 --> 00:43:55,951
Yea. What is it Craig? - Yea. I'm worried about
Bennet Tramer. - He isn't home yet.
- Yea. And he left the party at ten.

444
00:43:56,159 --> 00:43:57,827
It's only a little after ...

445
00:43:57,931 --> 00:43:59,078
eleven boys.

446
00:43:59,183 --> 00:44:00,538
He was real drunk.

447
00:44:00,851 --> 00:44:01,790
How old is he?

448
00:44:01,894 --> 00:44:03,250
Seventeen.

449
00:44:03,354 --> 00:44:05,335
He had this stupid mask on.

450
00:44:05,753 --> 00:44:07,004
All right boys.

451
00:44:07,838 --> 00:44:08,776
Seventeen ...

452
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,549
... and wearing a mask.

453
00:44:12,009 --> 00:44:14,929
Oh god.
- We should check his dental records.

454
00:44:16,597 --> 00:44:20,767
Old reservoir road. They had break-in the
elementary school. They're pretty sure it's him. - Come on!

455
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,787
Oh, stop.

456
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:22,290
Aw, shit!

457
00:45:22,811 --> 00:45:25,418
Shit. - Oh, you idiot!

458
00:45:25,731 --> 00:45:27,087
You could've broken it.

459
00:45:27,921 --> 00:45:29,693
I wish I had!

460
00:45:31,674 --> 00:45:34,281
I also could have used these on you.

461
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:37,306
What an asshole.

462
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:38,661
Happy Halloween.

463
00:45:40,433 --> 00:45:41,372
Budd ...

464
00:45:41,685 --> 00:45:43,770
you are the biggest jerk ...

465
00:45:43,979 --> 00:45:45,439
I've ever met.

466
00:45:49,089 --> 00:45:50,340
But you love me.

467
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:52,738
Yeah ...

468
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:55,136
I'm an idiot.

469
00:46:04,104 --> 00:46:06,711
Let's go down to the therapy room.

470
00:46:07,753 --> 00:46:10,152
Budd's finger needs a little bit of therapy.

471
00:46:11,299 --> 00:46:13,385
I can't leave the kids right now.

472
00:46:13,489 --> 00:46:15,469
Well, everybody is all weirded out tonight?

473
00:46:15,678 --> 00:46:17,659
All this Michael Myers crap.

474
00:46:19,015 --> 00:46:19,954
I just ...

475
00:46:22,456 --> 00:46:23,604
I just want ...

476
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:44,771
The therapy room's three doors down.

477
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:55,198
I suppose if we left the door open, we could hear if
somebody is coming ... or if the kids started to cry ...

478
00:46:56,033 --> 00:46:58,848
No. I ... I got to check it out first.

479
00:46:59,578 --> 00:47:00,726
Fifteen minutes.

480
00:47:03,019 --> 00:47:04,896
If everything's ok.

481
00:47:06,043 --> 00:47:07,399
You're wasting time.

482
00:47:19,286 --> 00:47:20,850
{y:i}Why don't you tell me?

483
00:47:21,685 --> 00:47:23,979
{y:i}Why don't you ever tell me anything?

484
00:47:24,603 --> 00:47:25,855
I told you ...

485
00:47:26,585 --> 00:47:28,358
I'm NOT your mother.

486
00:49:04,186 --> 00:49:05,021
It's hot.

487
00:49:33,174 --> 00:49:34,634
It's hot in here.

488
00:49:36,616 --> 00:49:37,658
It's just me.

489
00:49:52,361 --> 00:49:53,821
I'm not kidding.

490
00:49:55,176 --> 00:49:57,157
It's too hot in here now, Budd.

491
00:49:57,470 --> 00:49:58,722
Why don't you go check?

492
00:50:00,912 --> 00:50:02,163
It's cold out there.

493
00:50:03,832 --> 00:50:06,022
It can get cold in here.

494
00:50:09,045 --> 00:50:09,983
Gotcha.

495
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:27,043
Forget it, Budd.

496
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:28,710
I have to go back to work.

497
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:38,096
You wanna go for breakfast later?

498
00:51:41,641 --> 00:51:42,788
No ...

499
00:51:48,106 --> 00:51:49,253
I'm sorry.

500
00:51:52,068 --> 00:51:54,154
I just have to get back. That's all.

501
00:51:56,239 --> 00:51:58,429
Now. Budd, don't be that way.

502
00:52:37,219 --> 00:52:38,679
He got in here.

503
00:52:40,243 --> 00:52:41,494
And look over here.

504
00:52:50,462 --> 00:52:51,922
And here ...

505
00:53:00,368 --> 00:53:01,515
Sister.

506
00:53:03,601 --> 00:53:04,643
Is that it?

507
00:53:04,956 --> 00:53:05,895
No.

508
00:53:06,729 --> 00:53:07,563
Here.

509
00:53:14,654 --> 00:53:15,801
What's this?

510
00:53:16,114 --> 00:53:17,678
It's gibberish.

511
00:53:17,782 --> 00:53:18,721
No.

512
00:53:19,242 --> 00:53:20,702
It's a celtic word.

513
00:53:21,745 --> 00:53:22,788
Samhain ...

514
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:25,915
It means the Lord of the dead.

515
00:53:26,854 --> 00:53:28,105
The end of summer.

516
00:53:29,565 --> 00:53:30,817
The festival ...

517
00:53:30,921 --> 00:53:32,589
of samhain.

518
00:53:33,319 --> 00:53:34,883
October 31st.

519
00:53:36,864 --> 00:53:38,115
Dr. Loomis?

520
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:39,158
Yes?

521
00:53:40,305 --> 00:53:42,287
I have to talk to you.

522
00:53:44,164 --> 00:53:45,832
Oh, I didn't recognize you.

523
00:53:46,979 --> 00:53:48,438
What are you doing here?

524
00:53:48,856 --> 00:53:50,211
Privately.

525
00:54:00,952 --> 00:54:01,890
Thanks.

526
00:54:03,454 --> 00:54:04,601
Dr. Loomis ...

527
00:54:04,914 --> 00:54:07,209
You've been ordered back to Smith's Grove.

528
00:54:07,626 --> 00:54:08,669
Ordered?

529
00:54:09,086 --> 00:54:11,796
He can't order me.
- No, no ...

530
00:54:12,109 --> 00:54:13,673
but the governor can.

531
00:54:13,777 --> 00:54:17,010
He spoke to Dr. Rogers personally a few hours ago.
- The Governor ...

532
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:18,887
well, well ...

533
00:54:19,096 --> 00:54:22,015
Dr. Loomis this thing is all over the state.

534
00:54:22,432 --> 00:54:28,063
Patient escapes once, murders three teenagers.
You shoot him with a gun, he escapes again.

535
00:54:28,168 --> 00:54:30,357
Someone should have listened to me earlier.

536
00:54:30,775 --> 00:54:32,546
I know. I'm sorry.

537
00:54:33,694 --> 00:54:37,656
Dr. Rogers is just afraid that this could jeapordize
our whole rehabilitation program.

538
00:54:37,761 --> 00:54:43,288
He doesn't want anyone from the mental
health department anywhere near Haddonfield.
- Why did he send you down here then?

539
00:54:45,059 --> 00:54:46,937
In case you already found him.

540
00:54:47,249 --> 00:54:49,335
... alive.
- Tell Dr. Rogers ...

541
00:54:49,439 --> 00:54:53,506
Tell him you couldn't find me. Tell him anything.
I can't leave Haddonfield now.

542
00:54:53,924 --> 00:54:55,904
I'm afraid you don't have a choice.

543
00:54:57,260 --> 00:55:00,284
There's a marshal waiting for you outside.

544
00:55:16,864 --> 00:55:18,011
Laurie ...

545
00:55:22,807 --> 00:55:23,954
listen ...

546
00:55:25,623 --> 00:55:26,874
I know that ...

547
00:55:27,083 --> 00:55:28,856
you don't know me very well.

548
00:55:29,794 --> 00:55:31,983
But I just wanna let you to know that ...

549
00:55:33,235 --> 00:55:35,737
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.

550
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:37,093
Ok?

551
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:38,970
Promise.

552
00:55:44,705 --> 00:55:45,852
Laurie.

553
00:55:54,194 --> 00:55:55,341
Shit!

554
00:56:11,816 --> 00:56:13,276
Dr. Mixter?!

555
00:56:16,405 --> 00:56:17,864
Dr. Mixter.

556
00:56:23,078 --> 00:56:24,642
Dr. Mixter!

557
00:56:41,326 --> 00:56:42,994
Dr. Mixter?

558
00:56:47,583 --> 00:56:48,834
Dr. Mixter ...

559
00:56:48,938 --> 00:56:50,503
It's an emergency!

560
00:56:58,844 --> 00:57:01,347
Dr. Mixter, it's Laurie Strode.

561
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:03,640
She's had a reaction to the medication.

562
00:57:04,058 --> 00:57:05,726
You better come quick.

563
00:57:10,836 --> 00:57:12,296
Dr. Mixter.

564
00:57:54,318 --> 00:57:56,613
This is ridiculous. I'm gonna go find Mrs. Alves.

565
00:58:05,997 --> 00:58:07,457
Mrs. Alves?

566
01:00:12,169 --> 01:00:13,108
Laurie?

567
01:00:13,316 --> 01:00:14,568
You ok?

568
01:02:41,073 --> 01:02:42,325
We will find him.

569
01:02:43,055 --> 01:02:44,410
Where're you gonna look?

570
01:02:45,036 --> 01:02:46,287
I don't know.

571
01:02:47,747 --> 01:02:48,999
Neither do I.

572
01:03:18,821 --> 01:03:20,281
Mr. Garrett?

573
01:03:45,098 --> 01:03:47,184
Mr. Garrett!?

574
01:04:13,565 --> 01:04:15,129
Mr. Garrett?

575
01:04:17,632 --> 01:04:19,300
Mr. Garrett?

576
01:04:21,386 --> 01:04:22,219
Sorry.

577
01:04:23,262 --> 01:04:24,096
Listen ...

578
01:04:25,348 --> 01:04:26,912
I can't find anybody.

579
01:04:27,642 --> 01:04:28,894
Budd's gone ...
Mrs. Alves is gone.

580
01:04:31,605 --> 01:04:33,169
We gotta find Laurie.

581
01:04:33,586 --> 01:04:34,628
All right, listen.

582
01:04:36,192 --> 01:04:38,278
Why don't you check the East wing again?

583
01:04:38,487 --> 01:04:39,425
All right?

584
01:04:39,842 --> 01:04:44,952
And if you don't find anyone, I want you to
get into your car and drive out to the sheriff's station.
Get somebody out of here.

585
01:04:46,307 --> 01:04:47,037
All right?

586
01:04:49,227 --> 01:04:50,061
Ok.

587
01:04:50,478 --> 01:04:51,000
Ok.

588
01:04:51,208 --> 01:04:52,355
I'll keep looking.

589
01:05:12,897 --> 01:05:13,836
Hello?

590
01:05:47,204 --> 01:05:48,351
Jesus.

591
01:08:33,939 --> 01:08:34,982
Laurie!

592
01:08:39,048 --> 01:08:39,986
Laurie.

593
01:08:40,404 --> 01:08:41,655
Laurie wait!

594
01:08:45,096 --> 01:08:46,452
Wait Laurie ...

595
01:13:28,410 --> 01:13:30,287
He didn't believe me and now they're dead.

596
01:13:31,330 --> 01:13:32,790
I'm sorry.

597
01:13:32,998 --> 01:13:34,458
Don't feel sorry for me.

598
01:13:34,980 --> 01:13:37,066
Feel sorry for that little town back there.

599
01:13:37,586 --> 01:13:39,463
It'll be years before they forget this.

600
01:13:41,549 --> 01:13:44,364
Dr. Loomis, I think there's something else
you should know.

601
01:13:45,094 --> 01:13:47,806
You see the blackboard
back there in the Elementary school?

602
01:13:48,119 --> 01:13:49,265
Yea?

603
01:13:49,890 --> 01:13:51,559
In order to appease the gods,

604
01:13:51,663 --> 01:13:55,626
the druid priests ... held ... fire ... rituals.

605
01:13:55,835 --> 01:13:58,755
Prisoners of war, criminals, the insane ...

606
01:13:58,859 --> 01:14:00,110
animals ...

607
01:14:00,423 --> 01:14:01,361
were ...

608
01:14:02,403 --> 01:14:03,759
burned alive

609
01:14:03,863 --> 01:14:05,532
in baskets.

610
01:14:06,053 --> 01:14:10,642
By observing the way they died, the druids believed,
they could see omens of the future.

611
01:14:12,414 --> 01:14:15,542
2000 years later we've come no further.

612
01:14:17,106 --> 01:14:18,566
Samhain isn't ...

613
01:14:18,671 --> 01:14:20,339
evil spirits.

614
01:14:21,486 --> 01:14:24,092
It isn't goblins, ghosts or witches.

615
01:14:25,552 --> 01:14:28,159
it's the unconscious mind.

616
01:14:29,515 --> 01:14:32,957
We're all afraid of the dark inside ourselves.

617
01:14:35,147 --> 01:14:37,440
Dr. Loomis, please listen to me.

618
01:14:37,544 --> 01:14:41,507
There's a file on Michael Myers, that nobody knew about.
- I've seen everything. - No.

619
01:14:41,611 --> 01:14:45,782
No. It was hidden.
Sealed by the court after his parents were killed.

620
01:14:46,617 --> 01:14:51,830
Now after the Governor heard what happened tonight,
he authorized Dr. Rogers to open it.

621
01:14:52,038 --> 01:14:53,290
What file?

622
01:14:54,750 --> 01:14:56,001
It isn't fair.

623
01:14:56,106 --> 01:14:58,607
They should've allowed you to examine everything.

624
01:14:59,963 --> 01:15:01,006
That girl ...

625
01:15:01,214 --> 01:15:04,760
that Strode girl, that's Michael Myers sister.

626
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:07,471
She was born ...

627
01:15:07,576 --> 01:15:09,349
2 years before he was commited.

628
01:15:09,453 --> 01:15:13,310
Two years after ... his parents died
and she was adopted by the Strodes.

629
01:15:13,415 --> 01:15:19,567
They requested, that the records be sealed
in order to protect the family. - Jeez, don't you see,
what he's doing here in Haddonfield?

630
01:15:19,776 --> 01:15:23,008
He killed one sister fifteen years ago.
Now he's trying to kill the other!

631
01:15:24,155 --> 01:15:26,866
Tonight after I shot him, where did they take her?

632
01:15:27,283 --> 01:15:28,326
The clinic.

633
01:15:28,535 --> 01:15:30,933
Clinic where? Do you know this area well?

634
01:15:31,246 --> 01:15:32,080
A little bit.

635
01:15:32,289 --> 01:15:35,625
Where's the hospital located?
- Dr. Loomis we're under orders from the Governor!

636
01:15:35,834 --> 01:15:37,919
It's back around Seventeen about three miles.

637
01:15:38,024 --> 01:15:39,692
Turn this car around now!

638
01:15:39,796 --> 01:15:41,673
I can't do that. I've got orders.

639
01:15:41,882 --> 01:15:44,801
Those orders have changed!
- Dr. Loomis!

640
01:15:44,905 --> 01:15:47,095
Doctor, you're getting yourself into a lot of trouble.

641
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:50,537
What is your fellows usually do?
Fire a warning shot, right?

642
01:16:25,156 --> 01:16:25,990
Jimmy?

643
01:16:35,583 --> 01:16:36,522
It's all right.

644
01:16:37,669 --> 01:16:38,712
We're ...

645
01:16:39,233 --> 01:16:41,110
Ok, we're gonna get out of here.

646
01:16:52,476 --> 01:16:53,727
I think, I think ...

647
01:17:49,618 --> 01:17:53,372
I ought to handcuff you to the wheel,
but I have a feeling I'm gonna need you in there.

648
01:17:53,476 --> 01:17:54,623
Can I trust you?

649
01:17:55,666 --> 01:17:57,022
What have I got to loose ...

650
01:17:57,126 --> 01:17:58,482
except my job?

651
01:18:00,150 --> 01:18:01,402
I need help ...

652
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:05,468
Help ...

653
01:18:06,615 --> 01:18:08,179
Help ... me.

654
01:18:09,952 --> 01:18:12,246
HELP ME!!

655
01:18:20,692 --> 01:18:22,361
Go and check all the rooms down there.

656
01:18:22,465 --> 01:18:23,508
Go on!

657
01:18:23,612 --> 01:18:25,802
Dr. Loomis.
- You stay with me and shut up.

658
01:18:59,482 --> 01:19:00,630
HELP!

659
01:19:03,444 --> 01:19:04,383

662
01:19:16,896 --> 01:19:17,939
HELP!!

663
01:19:20,859 --> 01:19:22,319
PLEASE!

664
01:19:22,527 --> 01:19:24,196
PLEASE!

665
01:19:25,655 --> 01:19:26,698
PLEASE!

666
01:19:30,243 --> 01:19:31,286
Come on, get in!

667
01:20:06,009 --> 01:20:06,948
Stop!

668
01:20:07,157 --> 01:20:07,887
He is dead!

669
01:20:07,991 --> 01:20:09,138
No, he's not. Look at him!

670
01:20:09,242 --> 01:20:10,389
He's still breathing.

671
01:20:12,683 --> 01:20:13,517
Ok.

672
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:18,627
There's a two way radio over in the marshall's car.
I want you to go outside.

673
01:20:18,731 --> 01:20:20,712
Get on that radio and get help!

674
01:20:21,442 --> 01:20:22,693
Now wait a minute.

675
01:20:23,006 --> 01:20:25,196
I'm the only one authorized to use that.

676
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:26,238
Move!

677
01:20:30,410 --> 01:20:31,765
I'm sorry I left you.

678
01:20:32,391 --> 01:20:33,434
Are you all right?

679
01:20:37,396 --> 01:20:38,647
Why won't he die?

680
01:20:41,567 --> 01:20:42,923
Get away from him!

681
01:20:43,027 --> 01:20:44,487
But he's stopped breathing!

682
01:20:44,696 --> 01:20:45,529
No!

683
01:21:52,265 --> 01:21:53,934

687
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:36,061
Take that gun. Come on!
- No.

688
01:22:36,269 --> 01:22:37,312
Take it.

689
01:22:38,146 --> 01:22:39,189
Take it!

690
01:23:31,534 --> 01:23:32,577
Michael?!

691
01:23:49,262 --> 01:23:50,512
Michael STOP!

692
01:25:22,170 --> 01:25:24,568
Get out. get out. Go on.

01:25:24,776 --> 01:25:26,236
Go on. Get out.

01:25:27,696 --> 01:25:28,844
Get out NOW!

695
01:25:37,081 --> 01:25:38,958
It's time ...
Michael.

696
01:26:57,894 --> 01:26:59,041
What's the count?

697
01:26:59,249 --> 01:27:00,084
Ten.

698
01:27:00,814 --> 01:27:02,065
So far.

699
01:27:11,867 --> 01:27:15,830
Do you have any firsthand information ...
- Just leave me alone. -
... about what happened inside the hospital? - Excuse us.

700
01:27:18,540 --> 01:27:19,478
Can't I ride in front?

701
01:27:19,687 --> 01:27:21,460
No Laurie.
I'm sorry, I have to put you in back.

702
01:27:21,564 --> 01:27:22,190
Are you ready?

703
01:27:22,294 --> 01:27:23,650
Watch out for your feet.

704
01:27:24,276 --> 01:27:27,091

- Drop your feet carefull.

705
01:27:27,195 --> 01:27:29,177
... and into the ambulance.

706
01:27:30,219 --> 01:27:31,470
Big step.

707
01:27:31,992 --> 01:27:32,826
Big step ...

708
01:27:33,973 --> 01:27:34,911
Ok.

709
01:27:35,850 --> 01:27:37,831
Keep the leg up.
We'll have you out of here in a second.
