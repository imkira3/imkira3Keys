Here, you can take this ticket!

3
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:51,760
You can have this ticket and
keep it! I'm not paying that ticket!

4
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:57,023
Jesus! Why don't you watch
where you're going!

5
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,894
Then I want you to go
downstairs to the cellar

6
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:05,273
and check the water under the boiler.
I wanna do that today, all right!

7
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:07,900
- Could you do that?
- Would you mind giving me a hand?

8
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:11,487
I ain't the doorman, Ms. Barrett,
I'm the building superintendent.

9
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,989
You're also a human being.

10
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,992
It's not my job, but what
the hell, I'll do you a favor.

11
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:18,995
Listen, when are you gonna get around to
fixing the radiator in the baby's room?

12
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:22,290
- You know, I asked you last week.
- Didn't I do that?

13
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:25,715
Well, it's getting really
cold in there. I...

14
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:28,755
Okay, well, it's no problem.

15
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,312
Hey!

16
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:46,564
Hey, stop that carriage!

17
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:47,982
- Get it!
- Stop!

18
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,196
That's my baby!

19
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,994
Watch out!

20
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,742
Jesus!

21
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:59,711
Oscar, watch out!

22
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,293
My God!

23
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:04,875
Please!

24
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:13,842
Stop that carriage!

- How many of them are there?
- Fourteen. They're in here.

33
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:13,818
I hope you can handle it.
It's been like a nightmare.

- How big are they?
- Four feet.

00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,545

down and we'll have fun.

Yeah!

You know, my dad says you
guys are full of crap.

43
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:44,348
- Jason.
- Well, some people have trouble

44
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:47,977
- believing in the paranormal.
- No, he just says you're full of crap

45
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:50,526
and that's why you
went out of business.

- Yeah.

53
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:22,011
- Thank you. Call anytime.
- Bye.

54
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,929
Look, that's it. I've had it, Ray.

55
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,015
- No more parties.
- Here's your share.

56
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:29,268
Look, I'm tired of taking abuse
from overprivileged 9-year-olds.

57
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,563
I know, Z, but we can't quit now.
The holidays are coming up.

58
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:35,149
- It's our best season.
- Ray.

59
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,654
Man, face it. Ghostbusters
doesn't exist.

60
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:42,031
A year from now, those kids
won't even remember who we are.

61
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:45,785
Ungrateful little yuppie larvae.
After all we did for this city.

62
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:49,371
Yeah, we conjured up a
100-foot marshmallow man,

63
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:52,458
blew the top three floors
off an uptown high-rise,

64
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,127
ended up getting sued
by every state, county

65
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,046
and city agency in New York.

66
00:04:57,047 --> 00:05:00,517
Yeah, but what a ride.

67
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:19,527
right out into the middle of traffic
and I started really running after it.

68
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:23,572
And then it just suddenly stopped,
right in the middle of the street.

69
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,699
Mm-hm. And did anyone
else see this happen?

70
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,035
Well, sure, hundreds of people.

71
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:31,393
- Egon, I didn't imagine this.
- I'm not saying you did.

72
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:34,291
It's just in science, we always
look for the simplest explanation.

73
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,626
- We're ready, Dr. Spengler.
- Good.

74
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:38,425
We'll start with the
negative calibration.

75
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,342
- What are you working on, Egon?
- Trying to determine

76
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,428
whether human emotions actually
affect the physical environment.

77
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:49,974
It's a theory Ray and I had when
we were still Ghostbusters.

78
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,642
Can they see us?

79
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:55,443
No. They think they're here
for marriage counseling.

80
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,815
We kept them waiting for
two and a half hours.

81
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:00,442
I've been gradually increasing
the temperature in the room.

82
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,945
It's up to 95 degrees
at the moment.

83
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,990
Now my assistant has asked them

84
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,869
if they'd mind waiting
another half-hour.

85
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,163
Oh, good. Very good.

86
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,958
Very, very nice.

87
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:20,129
- So, Egon, what do you think?
- Excellent. Just excellent.

88
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,839
Do the happiness index next.

89
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,884
I mean about the carriage.

90
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:28,480
Well, I'd like to bring Ray in
on this, if you don't mind.

91
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:31,141
Sure. Whatever you think.

92
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:32,933
But not Venkman.

93
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,686
Oh, no.

94
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:38,480
- Do you ever see him?
- Occasionally.

95
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,357
- Peter?
- How is he these days?

96
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,735
Well, he was borderline
for a while.

97
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,330
Then he crossed the border.

98
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:48,411
Does he ever mention me?

99
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,827
No.

100
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:56,457
Oh. Well, we... We didn't
part on very good terms.

101
00:06:56,458 --> 00:07:00,377
And then we sort of lost track of
each other after I got married.

102
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:03,339
- We're ready for the affection test.
- Good, send in the puppy, please.

103
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:07,470
I thought of getting in touch with
him after my marriage ended, but...

104
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,762
Oh.

105
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,691
Isn't that sweet?

106
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,615
I appreciate your doing this.

107
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,364
Try not to worry.

108
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,695
Here's my phone number.
You'll call me?

109
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,072
Yes.

110
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:31,075
I'd rather you didn't mention any
of this to Peter, if you don't mind.

111
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:33,874
No, I won't. I won't.

112
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,207
Thanks.

113
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,380
Let's see what happens when
we take away the puppy.

114
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:47,054
This... Gee, I don't know...

115
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:53,055
father encouraged...

116
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,224
Hi. Welcome back to
<i>World of the Psychic.</i>

117
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,642
I'm Peter Venkman.

118
00:07:56,643 --> 00:08:01,522
I'm chatting with my guest.
Author, lecturer and psychic,

119
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:07,277
Milton Angland. Milt, your new book
is called <i>The End of the World.</i>

120
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,571
Now, can you tell us
when it's gonna be,

121
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,074
or do we have to buy the book?

122
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,368
Well, I predict that
the world will end

123
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:17,213
at the stroke of midnight
on New Year's Eve.

124
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,747
- This year?
- Mm-hm.

125
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:23,210
Well, that's cutting it a little
bit close, isn't it? I mean...

126
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:26,588
Just from a sales point of view,
I mean, your book is just coming out,

127
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,633
you're not gonna see any paperback
sales for at least a year.

128
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:33,137
It'll be at least another year before you
know whether you've got the mini-series

129
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:36,765
or Movie of the Week kind of possibilities.
Just devil's advocate, Milty.

130
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:40,394
I mean, shouldn't you have said,
"Hey, the world's gonna end in 1992"?

131
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,896
- Wait a minute. This is...
- Or better yet, 1994.

132
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:46,150
This is not just some
money-making scheme, all right?

133
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:51,623
I have a strong psychic belief...

134
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:56,493
that the world will end

135
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:59,292
on New Year's Eve.

136
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,879
- For your sake, I hope you're right.
- Thank you.

137
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,304
Okay, but I think my other
guest may disagree with you.

138
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,967
Elaine.

139
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,803
Now, you had another date in mind.

140
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,805
According to my source,

141
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:22,984
the end of the world will be on
February 14th in the year 2016.

142
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,398
Valentine's Day.

143
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,524
Bummer.

144
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,993
Where'd you get your date, Elaine?

145
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,827
I received this information
from an alien.

146
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,116
As I told my husband,

147
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,786
it was in the Paramus Holiday Inn.

148
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:42,331
I was having a drink
at the bar, alone,

149
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,541
and this alien approached me.

150
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:48,462
He started talking to me.
He bought me a drink.

151
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:52,883
And then I think he must
have used some kind of a ray

152
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:54,760
or a mind-control device,

153
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:58,013
because he forced me to
follow him to his room.

154
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,516
And that's where...

155
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:04,191
he told me about the
end of the world.

156
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:11,115
So your alien had a room at
the Holiday Inn, Paramus?

157
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:14,029
It might've been a
room on the spacecraft

158
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,366
made up to look like a
room at the Holiday Inn.

159
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:20,661
I can't be sure about that, Peter.

160
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:23,872
Of course not. And that is the
whole problem with aliens,

161
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,749
is you just can't trust them.

162
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,545
Occasionally you meet a
nice one: Starman, E.T.

163
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:32,881
But usually they turn out to
be some kind of big lizard!

164
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,884
That's all the time we've got for
this week on <i>World of the Psychic.</i>

165
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,678
Next week, though...

166
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:40,807
Give me Ira. Hairless pets.

167
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,725
Weird. Until then,

168
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,570
this is Peter Venkman, saying:

169
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,196
See you then. Bye.

170
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,443
Norman, where do you
find these people?

171
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:56,029
Weren't we supposed to have the
telekinetic guy who bends the spoons?

172
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,158
He canceled. This is the best we
could do at such short notice.

173
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,201
Look, no respected psychic
will come on the show.

174
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,579
- They think you're a fraud.
- I am a fraud.

175
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,582
Mr. Mayor. Lenny. Lenny!

176
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,250
- Pete Venkman.
- Can I help you?

177
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:10,335
Yeah, get your hand off me.

178
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,255
Thank you, I'm an old friend of the mayor's.
I wanna say hello, give him a kiss.

179
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,356
I'm Jack Hardemeyer, I'm
the mayor's assistant.

180
00:11:15,382 --> 00:11:20,304
I know who you are, Dr. Venkman.
I just don't see any ghosts anywhere.

181
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,681
That's why I wanted to
talk to His Highness.

182
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:26,018
See, we did a little job for the city a
while back and we got stiffed on the bill

183
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,854
by some bureaucratic
bookworm like yourself.

184
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:32,357
Look, you stay away from the mayor.
He's running for governor next fall.

185
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,277
And the last thing we need is for him
to be associated with two-bit frauds

186
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,322
and publicity hounds like
you and your friends.

187
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:40,240
You know, I'm a voter.

188
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:44,587
Aren't you supposed to lie
to me and kiss my butt?

189
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:52,628
All right, yes. Now, I want you
to put the Vigo in the arch.

190
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,005
Under the arch there.

191
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:57,174
Everything you're doing is bad.

192
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,803
I want you to know this.

193
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:03,096
You be careful there, all right?

194
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,599
No one listens to me.

195
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,561
Well, Dana, how are you doing?

196
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,522
- How's this Bonington coming?
- It's coming along fine.

197
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,108
This mixture you gave me
is working really well.

198
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:19,196
Yes? Well, I make pretty
good cocktails, don't I?

199
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:20,739
Yes, you're doing really

200
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,824
- quite good work there.
- Thank you.

201
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:27,501
It won't be long before
you can assist me in...

202
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:30,457
more important restoration.

203
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,043
Just a... A white thing.

204
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:34,962
Well, thank you, Dr. Poha.

205
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:37,506
- Janosz.
- Janosz.

206
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:39,967
Um, I've enjoyed working here,

207
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:43,720
but now that my baby's a little older, I'm
gonna try to go back to the orchestra.

208
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:47,516
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that
you will not... Be not here.

209
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,601
Well, could I say goodbye?

210
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,562
You know, maybe bring
you to a brunch today?

211
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:56,108
Well, I can't today, I have an
appointment. In fact, I'd better go.

212
00:12:56,109 --> 00:13:00,070
I don't understand this. You know, every
day I say, "Can you do something?"

213
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:02,197
You say, "No, I can't
do something."

214
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:05,742
- Do I have bad breath or something?
- Of course not.

215
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:09,713
All right. Well, I'll
give you a rain check.

216
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,754
I think that she likes me.

217
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,351
No, I do. I truly do.

218
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:30,559
This one's interesting,
Ray. Berlin, 1939.

219
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,687
A flower cart took off by
itself, rolled half a kilometer.

220
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:37,190
- Three hundred eyewitnesses.
- My best to the coven.

221
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,276
Berlin, huh? You know,

222
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:42,946
you should also check Duke University
studies on controlled psychokinesis.

223
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,949
- I pulled it.
- Perhaps you could you help me,

224
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,618
I'm looking for a
love-potion aerosol

225
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:52,039
that I could spray on a
certain Penthouse Pet

226
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,999
to obtain her total submission.

227
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,293
- Hello, Venkman.
- Hi, Pete. How's it going?

228
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:59,463
Very well. Hi, Egon. How's school?

229
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:02,924
I bet those science chicks really dig
that large cranium of yours, huh?

230
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:06,269
I think they're more
interested in my epididymis.

231
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:12,893
Ray, let's close this place up
so you can buy me a calzone.

232
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:15,437
I really can't do that right now,
Pete. I'm working on something.

233
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,439
But your book came in.

234
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,318
<i>- Magical Paths to Fortune and Power.</i>
- Thank you.

235
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,528
Good luck with that, Venkman.

236
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,322
- Put this on my account, please?
- Sure.

237
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,115
- Ray, take a look at this.
- Oh, yeah.

238
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,451
What are you guys working on?

239
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:32,287
- Uh, well, we're just kind of...
- Ahem.

240
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,456
checking something out
for an old friend.

241
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:36,208
Neat. Who?

242
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,459
Um...

243
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,296
Ray's Occult.

244
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,924
Seven o'clock on weekdays,
midnight on Saturdays.

245
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,768
Thank you.

246
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,305
- Who?
- Who?

247
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:53,400
- Just someone we know.
- Oh.

248
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:55,602
Who?

249
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:58,355
- I can't! No! No! No!
- Yes, you can. Who?

250
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:00,482
- Nobody! Nobody!
- Can you tell me now?

251
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,109
- I can't!
- Now?

252
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,738
Dana Barrett!

253
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,830
Ow.

254
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,448
My Dana Barrett?

255
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,830
I'll get it.

256
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,504
- Hi, Dana.
- Hi, Ray.

257
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:25,340
How good to see you.
Thanks for coming.

258
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,551
Hey, no problem. Always
glad to help. And hug.

259
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,010
- Hello, Dana.
- Hi, Egon.

260
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,387
Nice place.

261
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,514
Well, I know I'm just
asking for the big hurt

262
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,975
but I thought I'd give
us one more chance.

263
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:38,019
He tortured me. He pulled my ears.

264
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,397
Hello, Peter.

265
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,983
Hello, Dana.

266
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:47,112
- So, what would you like to do first?
- We'd like to examine the baby.

267
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:50,991
Yeah, and anything associated with
the baby, especially stuffed toys.

268
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:53,535
- Then we'd like to see the buggy.
- All right. Can I put him here?

269
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:55,704
- And wherever he sleeps.
- Yes.

270
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:57,289
- This'll be fine.
- This okay?

271
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,915
- That's fine.
- Okay.

272
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,709
We'll have to lay him down flat.

273
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,545
Okay, sweetheart, now they're
gonna take a look at you.

274
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,714
We'll do a cursory
medical examination.

275
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:08,049
What do you say? Gammel and
Pross Infant Acuity Test?

276
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,552
Sounds good. We'll finish
with an Apgar score.

277
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,637
It's nothing that's
gonna hurt him, right?

278
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:16,517
No. No, I don't think so.
He'll be fine.

279
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,237
- You ever done this before?
- On a chimp.

280
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,156
So whatever happened
to Mr. Right, anyway?

281
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,617
I heard he ditched you
and ran off to Europe.

282
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:36,745
He didn't ditch me.
We had some problems

283
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:40,457
and he got a very good job offer from
an orchestra in London and he took it.

284
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,335
So he ditched you.

285
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:46,922
Okay. Subject is a male Caucasian,

286
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:49,216
- approximately...
- Twenty four inches.

287
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:51,718
Twenty-four inches in length.

288
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:56,306
Subject weighs approximately 18
pounds and is about 8 months old.

289
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:58,934
Okay. Ocular?

290
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:01,394
Pupillary response normal.

291
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,730
Auditory.

292
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,780
- Appears normal.
- Apillary reflex.

293
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,737
- Appears to be ticklish.
- Yep. Baby ticklish.

294
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:14,117
You know, you'd have been
better off marrying me.

295
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:17,869
You never asked me.

296
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:22,420
And whenever I brought it up,
you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.

297
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,128
You never got it, Dana.

298
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:30,048
I'm a man. I'm sensitive.

299
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,635
I need to feel loved.
I need to be desired.

300
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:37,055
It was when you started introducing
me as "the old ball and chain."

301
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,229
That's when I left.

302
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:43,103
Well, I may have a lot
of personal problems,

303
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:46,106
but I'm a total professional
when it comes to my job.

304
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:48,733
- Hey, Egon.
- What?

305
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,778
- What are we doing?
- He seems to be fine, Dana.

306
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,697
- Mm-hm. He's very healthy.
- He's okay.

307
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:56,116
When he does sleep,
where do you put him?

308
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:58,535
Right around here. I'll show you.

309
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:01,710
Venkman, would you get
a stool specimen, please?

310
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,666
Business or personal?

311
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,962
It's a little messy.

312
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:11,923
Well, we don't wanna play with anything,
we just wanna sweep for valences.

313
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,675
Mm. Very cheerful.

314
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:16,429
My parents didn't believe in toys.

315
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:26,025
You wanna play with a big kid?

316
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,652
You know, I should
have been your father.

317
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,496
I mean, I could have been.

318
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,335
I understand.

319
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:53,841
Help! He's gone completely
berserk. Help!

320
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:57,770
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.

321
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,389
You mean you never
even had a Slinky?

322
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,558
We had part of a Slinky.

323
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,185
But I straightened it.

324
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:08,064
Help! Help!

325
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,775
He...

326
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:14,903
He had some sort of clear
liquid coming out of his mouth.

327
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:17,498
Yeah, well, that happens.

328
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:19,908
Well, what do you think?

329
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,576
Well, he's ugly.

330
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,912
I mean, he's not Elephant Man ugly,

331
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:26,456
but he's not attractive.
Was his father ugly?

332
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:28,416
- Don't listen.
- And he stinks.

333
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:31,044
You're ripe, señor.

334
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:33,088
Did his father stink?

335
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:36,466
Yeah. Daddy was a smelly, huh?

336
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:39,427
- What's your name?
- His name is Oscar.

337
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:42,472
Named after a hot dog.
You poor man.

338
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:43,973
You poor, poor man.

339
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:46,935
But seriously, there's nothing...

340
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:49,396
unusual about him, is there?

341
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:53,447
Well, I don't have a lot
of experience with babies.

342
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,778
But you're excited now,

343
00:19:56,779 --> 00:20:00,073
because Mama's here to get your
stool sample. Right, Mama?

344
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:02,542
- Stool sample?
- Yeah.

345
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,831
- Nothing.
- So, what, brainiac?

346
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:10,542
I'd like to run some gynaecological
tests on the mother.

347
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:13,842
- Who wouldn't?
- Let's check the street.

348
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,257
It stopped right over there,

349
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:20,218
- in the middle of the crosswalk.
- All right, I can get us out there.

350
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,011
- Hey. Venkman.
- Hold on.

351
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:24,639
We're scientists, excuse us.
Get out of the way!

352
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,891
Thanks a lot. We gotta
do an inquiry here.

353
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,102
Hold on. Thanks. Appreciate it.

354
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:30,562
Thanks.

355
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:31,855
You gonna move out
of there or what?

356
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:35,316
Relax, you're on the meter. Come on, hey!
We're scientists, get out of the way.

357
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,487
I think we hit the honeypot.

358
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:43,700
There's something brewing under the
street. I've got 1118 on the PKE.

359
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:45,994
Two-point-five GEVs
on the gigameter.

360
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:47,917
Well, what does that mean?

361
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:06,185
Hey! How you doing?

362
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:09,185
- Me?
- Yeah.

363
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:14,564
- Fine. Fine. It's cutting fine now.
- Great.

364
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,274
Why are you cutting?

365
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,109
Why am I cutting?

366
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,612
- Yeah.
- Boss!

367
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:24,240
Who told you to stop cutting?

368
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,242
- Somebody tell you to stop...?
- What're you guys doing here?

369
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,744
Did you tell him to stop cutting?

370
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:29,078
Yes, I told him to stop.
What are you doing?

371
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:32,457
What's it look like we're doing here? Why
don't you let us work? We let you work.

372
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,876
Hey, take it easy. He's been working
overtime. I tell you why we're here.

373
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,589
We're here because some
diaper bag downtown

374
00:21:36,615 --> 00:21:39,322
is being a jerk and making us work on
a Friday night. Am I right, Peter?

375
00:21:39,323 --> 00:21:42,410
Of course you're right,
Raymond. Is he right, Ziggy?

376
00:21:42,436 --> 00:21:43,415
Yo.

377
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,846
- You guys take it easy, all right?
- Come on. Come on.

378
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,389
What have you been doing?

379
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,725
What have I been doing? While you
were getting coffee for an hour,

380
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,695
I've been digging a big hole
in the middle of the street.

381
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:57,282
Looks like you uncovered
an old air shaft.

382
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,317
Man, that just goes on and on.

383
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,821
This is very intense. We
should get a deeper reading.

384
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:06,292
Yeah. We're gonna need
a deeper reading.

385
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,827
Yeah, somebody has
to go down there.

386
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:12,002
Yeah, somebody's
gotta go down there.

387
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:27,938
Stinging! I'm stinging!

388
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,143
Listen to me.

389
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:35,395
What? Who?

390
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:39,440
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia,

391
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:43,862
the sorrow of Moldavia,
command you.

392
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,072
Oh, command me, lord.

393
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:50,368
On a mountain of skulls
in the castle of pain

394
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:54,497
I sat on a throne of blood.

395
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,708
What was, will be.

396
00:22:56,709 --> 00:23:00,295
What is, will be no more.

397
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:05,142
Now is the season of evil.

398
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,885
Evil?

399
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:12,483
Find me a child, that
I might live again.

400
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:16,436
Yes. A child.

401
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:19,816
A child. A child?

402
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,920
A child.

403
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:42,421
You all right?

404
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:45,506
Yeah, I'm good.
The speed's good, boys.

405
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:48,135
Keep it coming.

406
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:04,951
We're breaking through.
I see some light.

407
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:09,322
I'm in some kind of a chamber.
There's tile work.

408
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:11,199
- Slime!
- What?

409
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,702
It's a river of slime!

410
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:20,463
There's gotta be 25,000 gallons of it.
It's flowing through here like a river.

411
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:24,212
Van Horne. Pneumatic
transit. I can't believe it.

412
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:26,965
It's the old pneumatic transit
system, it's still here.

413
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:29,842
Okay. That's good.
Hold me up. That's good.

414
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:32,061
What do you see?

415
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:37,058
All right. Let's see
if I can get a sample.

416
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,893
What's going on here?

417
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:42,238
Hey, what's the story?

418
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:46,609
Hey, what, you boneheads are gonna
come and roust me out again?

419
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,195
I got 3000 phones out
in Greenwich Village.

420
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:52,115
I got about 8 million miles
of cable I gotta check.

421
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:54,409
You gonna come shake
my monkey tree again?!

422
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:58,084
What are you talking about, buddy?
The phone lines are over there.

423
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:01,666
What did I say to you? The
phone lines are over there.

424
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:04,544
- What did I say? How many times?
- Hey! Hey!

425
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:08,214
Hey, you're not with Con Ed or
the phone company. We checked.

426
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:10,058
So tell me another one.

427
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:13,177
I've got a major gas leak here!

428
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:16,431
Where do you think all this
is coming from, the sky?

429
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,312
Okay, boys.

430
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:24,939
Boys?

431
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,238
Pull me up now, all right?

432
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:31,413
There's some kind of activity
going on with this stuff.

433
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,072
Boys? Hey, help!

434
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,866
- Take me up!
- Ray!

435
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:37,243
Start it! Start it!

436
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,620
Boys? Hey, what's
going on up there?

437
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:42,670
Come on! Get me out of this hole!

438
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:03,061
Sweetie.

439
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:05,146
Hello.

440
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:07,820
Go back to sleep, darling.

441
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,820
- Who is it?
- It's Janosz.

442
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,119
Janosz.

443
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:18,543
Hello, Janosz.

444
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:21,871
- This is a surprise.
- Oh, hello.

445
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:27,126
Uh, yes. Well, I happened to
be here in this neighborhood

446
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:31,097
and I thought that I would stop
by to see how is it with you.

447
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,634
Yeah, because of all
this blackness, it was.

448
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:37,845
- We're fine. Thank you. Thank...
- Well, then, you're okay?

449
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:40,556
- How's the baby?
- He's okay. Yes.

450
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,141
Whoo.

451
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:45,478
- He's sleeping.
- Oh, but I "woo"-ed.

452
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:47,980
- That's okay.
- All right, and

453
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:51,150
do you need anything? You know?

454
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,528
Do you want me to come in?

455
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:59,033
- No, thank you.
- All right.

456
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:02,703
Just thought that I
would check. You know.

457
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:08,210
Well, hey, you. Don't
let the bedbugs bite.

458
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,175
Good night, Janosz.

459
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:34,026
Before we begin this trial, I want
to make one thing very clear.

460
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:36,904
The law does not recognize
the existence of ghosts

461
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:39,031
and I don't believe in them either.

462
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:42,952
I don't want to hear a lot of malarkey
about goblins, spooks and demons.

463
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:45,163
We're gonna stick to
the facts in this case

464
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:47,832
and leave the ghost stories
to the kiddies, understood?

465
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:50,334
Wow, sounds like a pretty
open-minded guy, huh?

466
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,878
Yeah, they call him "The Hammer."

467
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:54,755
What can we do? It's all in
the hands of our lawyer now.

468
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:57,008
I think you guys are
making a big mistake.

469
00:27:57,009 --> 00:28:00,428
I do mostly tax law and some
probate stuff occasionally.

470
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:02,722
I got my law degree
at night school.

471
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:06,602
Well, that's fine, Louis.
We got arrested at night.

472
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:09,103
Look, just put these guys away fast

473
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:12,481
and make sure they go away
for a long, long time, okay?

474
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:15,443
I don't think it's gonna be hard,
with this list of charges.

475
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:18,197
Good. Very good.

476
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,741
Violating a judicial
restraining order,

477
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:25,536
willful destruction of public
property, fraud, malicious mischief.

478
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:29,790
See you in a couple of years,
at your first parole hearing.

479
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,713
You'll never take us alive.

480
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:35,088
All right, all right.
Let's get on with it.

481
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:36,756
Your Honor,

482
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:40,136
ladies and gentlemen
of the audience,

483
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:43,846
I don't think it's fair to
call my clients frauds.

484
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:47,099
Okay, so the blackout was a big
problem for everybody, okay?

485
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,728
I was stuck in an elevator for two hours
and I had to make the whole time.

486
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,230
But I don't blame them.

487
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:56,736
Because one time I turned into a
dog and they helped me. Thank you.

488
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:05,411
Very good, Louis.
Short but pointless.

489
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:07,828
Mr. Fianella,

490
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:13,176
please look at exhibits A through
F on the table over here.

491
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:15,211
Do you recognize this equipment?

492
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:18,130
Yeah, that's the stuff the
cops took from their truck.

493
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,758
Do you know what this
equipment is used for?

494
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,970
I don't know. Catching
ghosts, maybe? I don't know.

495
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:28,474
May I remind the court the defendants
are under a judicial restraining order

496
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:31,519
that strictly forbids them
from performing services

497
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,313
as paranormal investigators
or eliminators.

498
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,190
So noted.

499
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,276
Now, Mr. Fianella,

500
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:42,873
can you identify the substance
in this jar marked "Exhibit F"?

501
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:47,868
Yeah. Yeah, that's
the stuff, all right.

502
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:51,539
Your Honor, I've been working
underground for Con Ed for 27 years.

503
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,874
I never saw anything
like this in my life.

504
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:56,502
Whatever's down there,
they must've put it there.

505
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,337
- No, we didn't!
- Ray, Ray.

506
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,755
Shut up!

507
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:02,842
- So you were just trying to help...
- Help out a friend.

508
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:05,011
- Who was frightened.
- Who was scared.

509
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:06,721
And when you're scared... What?

510
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:10,057
- There was no evil...
- No evil was intended. No malice.

511
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,518
When you live in a place and
you love it like you do,

512
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,520
you don't want nothing
bad to happen.

513
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,105
- What?
- It was a one-shot...

514
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:20,067
Because it'll never happen again. It's an
isolated incident, it's a one-shot deal.

515
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,736
- Objection, Your Honor.
- What?

516
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,821
- He's leading the witness.
- Sustained.

517
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,823
Give me a break.
We're both lawyers.

518
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:29,410
Mr. Tully, do you have any
questions for this witness

519
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:32,121
that might have some
bearing on this case?

520
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:35,166
- Do I?
- No, we've helped them out enough.

521
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,251
No, Your Honor.

522
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,004
Your witness.

523
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,840
Dr. Venkman...

524
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:47,011
would you please tell the court why
it is that you and your co-defendants

525
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:51,390
took it upon yourselves to dig a very
big hole in the middle of First Avenue.

526
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:53,851
Well, there's so many
holes in First Avenue

527
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,650
we really didn't think
anyone would notice.

528
00:30:57,189 --> 00:31:00,442
Keep that up, mister,
I'll find you in contempt.

529
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,777
I'm truly sorry, Your Honor.

530
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:05,863
I'll ask you again, Dr. Venkman,
why were you digging the hole?

531
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,287
And please remember
you're under oath.

532
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,743
There are some things in this world

533
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:13,996
that go way beyond
human understanding.

534
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,915
Things that cannot be explained,

535
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:18,584
things that most people
don't wanna know about.

536
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:21,128
That is where we come in.

537
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:24,131
So what you're saying is that
the world of the supernatural

538
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,175
is your exclusive province?

539
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:29,220
Kitten, I think what
I'm saying is that

540
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:32,973
sometimes shit happens,
someone has to deal with it,

541
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:35,602
and who you gonna call?

542
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:39,063
Shut up!

543
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:43,317
Peter Venkman, Raymond Stantz,
Egon Spengler, stand up!

544
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,491
Get up!

545
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:49,036
You too, Mr. Tully.

546
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,410
I find you guilty on all charges.

547
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:55,755
I order you to pay fines in
the amount of $25,000 each.

548
00:31:55,956 --> 00:32:00,000
I sentence you to 18 months at the city
correctional facility at Riker's Island.

549
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:02,378
Egie, she's twitching.

550
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:04,630
I'm not finished!

551
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:07,800
On a more personal note,
let me just go on record

552
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:10,928
as saying that there's no place
for fakes, charlatans...

553
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,430
- Uh, your Honor...
- Shut up!

554
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:16,100
- Tricksters like you in decent society.
- Your Honor, this is important.

555
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:18,352
You play on the gullibility
of innocent people.

556
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,854
- Yes, sir.
- Be quiet!

557
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:22,106
- But...
- If my hands weren't tied

558
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:24,191
by the unalterable
fetters of the law

559
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:28,028
then I would invoke the tradition
of our illustrious forebears,

560
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:32,283
reach back to a purer,
sterner justice

561
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:36,334
and have you burned at the stake!

562
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,384
Wow.

563
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:48,387
Oh, my God, the Scoleri brothers.

564
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:56,182
- The Scoleri brothers!
- Friends of yours?

565
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:59,732
I tried them for murder!
Gave them the chair!

566
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,772
You gotta do something!

567
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:07,402
Why don't you just tell them
you don't believe in ghosts.

568
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,998
You gotta do something. Help me!

569
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,167
Don't talk to me.
Talk to my attorney.

570
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:26,420
That's me! My guys are still under
a judicial misstrangement order.

571
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:29,924
That blue thing I got from her.
They could be exposing themselves.

572
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:32,928
And you don't want us
exposing ourselves.

573
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:49,235
- You're next, Bubbles.
- All right! I rescind the order!

574
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:51,487
- Case dismissed!
- Hurray! We won the case!

575
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:53,240
Now, do something!

576
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:03,341
I always hated this
part of the business.

577
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:11,465
You know, it's been a couple
years since we used this stuff.

578
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,384
- I hope it still works.
- It should.

579
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:15,970
Power cells have a
half-life of 5000 years.

580
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:18,305
There's no time for a bench test.

581
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,558
Heat them up.

582
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:26,773
- Do...
- Re...

583
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:29,276
Egon!

584
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,042
Whoa.

585
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:38,686
You got him, Venkman!
Hold him! Steady.

586
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:44,480
Come on, big boy. I'm gonna take
you home to my private zoo.

587
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,646
You got him. You got him!

588
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:50,990
- Egie, bring the trap.
- Okay, okay.

589
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,944
Behind you, Ray!

590
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,741
Hold him, Ray!

591
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:03,495
Venkman, start bringing him back!

592
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:06,747
Come on, you big meanie.
Let's go, chubby.

593
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:09,583
Ray, keep pulling him to the right.

594
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,506
Okay, the trap's going in.

595
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,256
No, no, Spengie!

596
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:18,726
- Hold it, Ray!
- Hit it!

597
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:29,687
- Two in the box!
- Ready to go!

598
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:32,272
- We be fast.
- And they be slow!

599
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,366
Wow.

600
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:39,196
We're the best! We're the
beautiful! We're the only

601
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:42,157
- Ghostbusters.
- We're back!

602
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:49,916
Ghostbusters.

603
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,793
Yes, we're back.

Careful.

- Don't bother. Watch this.

654
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,743
Try it, Ray.

655
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:26,827
You! You worthless piece of slime!

656
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,700
You ignorant, disgusting blob.

660
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:40,961
I have seen some
disgusting crud in my time

but you take the cake.

662
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:46,308
- You're a... You're just...
- Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,263
This is what you do
with your spare time?

664
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:53,307
Peter, this is an
incredible breakthrough.

665
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:55,934
What a discovery.
A psycho-reactive substance.

666
00:39:55,935 --> 00:40:00,156
Whatever this stuff is, it responds
to human emotional states.

667
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,567
Mood slime.

668
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,327
Oh, baby.

669
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:09,072
You mean this stuff actually
feeds on bad vibes.

670
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,908
Like a cop in a doughnut factory.

671
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:14,828
We've been running tests to see if we can
get an equally strong positive reaction.

672
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,747
What kind of tests?

673
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:21,168
Well, we sing to it
and we talk to it

674
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:24,263
and say supportive,
nurturing things to it.

675
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:27,846
You're not sleeping
with it, are you, Ray?

676
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:34,106
Oh, you.

677
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:37,517
- It's always the quiet ones.
- You hound.

678
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:42,148
- Ahem. How about the kinetic tests?
- Okay.

679
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,984
Ordinary household toaster.

680
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,237
We'll take your word for that.

681
00:40:53,568 --> 00:40:56,048
It responds to music, so we've
been doing some experimentation,

682
00:40:56,062 --> 00:40:58,247
playing easy listening.
Middle-of-the-road-type stuff.

683
00:40:58,273 --> 00:41:00,666
You know, Paul Young, "Dust in
the Wind." That works okay.

684
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:03,794
- Works for me.
- Loves Jackie Wilson.

night when I'm not here?

Oh, I get it. It sings. It
sounds exactly like Jackie.

You're good, pretty eyes.

708
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:05,207
I didn't paint it.
I'm just cleaning it.

709
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:08,302
- It's a Gauguin.
- Oh, I've heard of him.

710
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:13,340
Hey, Dana. Aren't you going to
introduce me to your friend?

711
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:17,385
Sure. Peter Venkman,
this is Dr. Janosz Poha,

712
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:19,471
the head of our department.

713
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:22,432
Yes, I have, of course, have
seen you on the television.

714
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:25,185
Quite enjoy. You're not
here on business, I hope?

715
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:29,189
Well, it's top-secret. Say,
Johnny, you got a Gauguin too.

716
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:34,528
No. Actually, I'm preparing this portrait
for the new Romantic exhibition.

717
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:39,660
Yes. This is Prince Vigo, the
ruler of Carpathia and Moldavia.

718
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:41,953
Bit of a sissy, isn't he?

719
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:45,705
He was a very powerful
magician, Dr. Venkman.

720
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:48,708
And a genius in many ways.

721
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:52,295
He was also a lunatic
and a genocidal madman.

722
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,881
I hate this painting.
I've felt uncomfortable

723
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:57,008
ever since it came up from storage.

724
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:59,719
Well, you're probably feeling
what Vigo is feeling:

725
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,556
Carpathian kitten loss.
He's missed his kitten.

726
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:04,724
We'll just put one in
here by the castle.

727
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:07,227
We don't go around altering
valuable artwork, Dr. Venkman.

728
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:09,813
Go. Yes, I think, go.
Yes, the joyfulness is over.

729
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:11,231
He's kidding.

730
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:14,985
Well, you're not gonna get a green
card with that attitude, pal. Okay?

731
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:19,197
I don't know what to...
Oh, of course. Of course.

732
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:21,449
I get it. You're sweet on
this hunky stud, aren't you?

733
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,411
You know, Peter, every now
and then I get the feeling

734
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:28,291
that painting is watching
me, even smiling at me.

735
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:46,766
You know, I think we got
more food on your shirt

736
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:49,611
than we did in your mouth.

737
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,104
Okay.

738
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:54,779
Bath. You get to take
a bath, don't you?

739
00:44:57,111 --> 00:45:00,405
Yes, do your favorite thing.

740
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:02,407
Because I know what you get to do.

741
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:04,951
You know what you get to do?

742
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:08,788
Do you know what's more
fun than anything? Huh?

743
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:10,582
Splash Mommy.

744
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:14,669
"I get to splash Mommy." Yes.

745
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:41,613
We'll be ready in just a moment.

746
00:45:41,614 --> 00:45:44,242
Mommy's gonna take
her shirt off too.

747
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:59,594
No! No!

748
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:07,348
Peter, it's me. Please let us in.

749
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:11,481
What the hell is this?

750
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:17,862
Peter, let us in, please.

751
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:21,069
I didn't know where else to go.

752
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:23,822
The most awful thing happened.

753
00:46:23,823 --> 00:46:27,033
The bathtub... The bathtub
was trying to eat Oscar.

754
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:30,662
I was giving him a bath. There was
all this pink ooze everywhere

755
00:46:30,663 --> 00:46:33,873
- and it was reaching for him.
- Okay, you're all right.

756
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:35,667
I'm not gonna let them get you.

757
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:39,254
- All right. You're all safe now, okay?
- I was so terrified.

758
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:42,757
- Yes, darling. I'm so sorry.
- You guys just sit down. Relax.

759
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:48,139
Come on. Just sit down. I'll get you
guys a shirt or something. Hold on.

760
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:57,611
Ray. Yeah, Dana's just
come over to my place.

761
00:46:57,732 --> 00:47:00,576
Well, actually, her
tub tried to eat her.

762
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:03,570
What? Are you serious?

763
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:05,071
Well, that's great!

764
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:07,824
I mean, that's terrible.

765
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,243
But it's great for what we...

766
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:11,995
Yeah, I will.

767
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:14,247
Yeah, sure, we'll get right on it.

768
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:17,542
Spengler. A major slime-related
psychokinetic event.

769
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:20,211
- What happened?
- Something came out of Dana's bathtub.

770
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:22,797
- Tried to grab her and the baby.
- Are they all right?

771
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:25,842
- She got out and went to Venkman's.
- This is interesting, Ray.

772
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:28,011
Remember the painting
Venkman mentioned?

773
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:31,264
I ran "Vigo the Carpathian"
through the occult reference net.

774
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:33,108
Look what came up.

775
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:37,112
Ooh. Nice ugly history.

776
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:41,325
You think there's a connection between
this Vigo character and the...

777
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:47,030
slime?

778
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:50,956
Is the atomic weight
of cobalt 58.9?

779
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:54,788
We better get over to Dana's apartment.
I'd like to check out that bathtub.

780
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:57,832
It might be a good idea to go
to the museum in the morning,

781
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:00,256
get a look at that painting.

782
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:03,505
Ray's gonna go on over to your
place and just take a look.

783
00:48:03,506 --> 00:48:05,840
- He is?
- Okay.

784
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:09,060
I have been holding on to
this for a long time, Oscar.

785
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:15,392
I got this from a girl who got
this from Joe Willie Namath, okay?

786
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:17,477
We don't know how.
We don't wanna know.

787
00:48:17,478 --> 00:48:21,231
So I would appreciate it if you
would not hose this thing down,

788
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:23,733
you know, give it your own
personal rinse. Thank you.

789
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,902
Be an excellent time for
you to start practicing

790
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:29,077
a thing we big guys like
to call self-control.

791
00:48:29,657 --> 00:48:34,244
Get out of here. Oh, look at him.
Look at him. Oh, look at his gut.

792
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:37,414
Oh, he's a coconut, this guy.

793
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:41,459
You're gonna be staying at Uncle
Pete's until this thing blows over.

794
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,008
This is your place now.

795
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,515
Hi.

796
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:56,645
Come on in. This is my place.

797
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:04,941
So how are we gonna handle
the sleeping arrangements?

798
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,943
Well, what's best for me is

799
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:10,280
if I lie on my side like this
and you spoon up beside me,

800
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:13,876
your arm draped over me.
We do it the other way,

801
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:19,289
I get your hair caught in my
throat and I choke in the night.

802
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:23,710
Well, how about you on the sofa
and me and the baby in the bed?

803
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:26,179
It's a way to go.

804
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:30,133
It's so late. I really
ought to put him down.

805
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:33,888
- May I?
- Yeah, if you want to.

806
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,972
You're short.

807
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,016
Your belly button
sticks out too far.

808
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:41,441
And you're a terrible
burden on your poor mother.

809
00:49:52,206 --> 00:49:53,453
You find anything at Dana's?

810
00:49:53,454 --> 00:49:56,014
Nothing but mood some slime
residue around the bathtub.

811
00:49:56,016 --> 00:49:58,745
But I did get something on that
Vigo character you mentioned.

812
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:01,930
Found it in <i>Magicians, Martyrs
and Madmen.</i> Dig that.

813
00:50:01,956 --> 00:50:05,877
Vigo the Carpathian,
born 1505, died 1610.

814
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:07,670
105 years old. He hung
in there, didn't he?

815
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:11,257
He didn't die of old age, either.
He was poisoned, stabbed, shot,

816
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:13,635
hung, stretched, disembowelled,
drawn and quartered.

817
00:50:13,636 --> 00:50:14,844
Ouch.

818
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:17,805
- I guess he wasn't too popular.
- Not exactly a man of the people.

819
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:20,016
Also known as Vigo the
Cruel, Vigo the Torturer,

820
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:22,227
Vigo the Despised and
Vigo the Unholy.

821
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:24,062
Wasn't he also Vigo the Butch?

822
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:25,939
And dig this. There was a prophecy.

823
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:29,150
Just before his head died,
his last words were:

824
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:34,077
"Death is but a door. Time is
but a window. I'll be back."

825
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:42,121
Let's suck in the guts, guys.
We're the Ghostbusters.

826
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:46,000
- Go! Go. Please, go. You. Yes, you.
- Who's this wiggler?

827
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:48,878
- He's yours, Ray. Sic him.
- I have...

828
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:51,881
Hi, how are you? Ray Stantz from
the Ghostbusters. Nice to see you.

829
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:54,801
Beautiful lab you have here. We're
just doing a routine spook check.

830
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:56,856
Dr. Venkman, Dana is not here.

831
00:50:56,857 --> 00:50:59,196
- Yeah, we know that, Johnny.
- So why are you came?

832
00:50:59,197 --> 00:51:01,774
Well, we got a report there was
a major creep in the area.

833
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,893
We checked our list, and
you were right on the top.

834
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:06,938
Johnny, where in the hell
are you from, anyway?

835
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:09,023
The Upper West Side.

836
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:11,572
The whole room's
extremely hot, Peter.

837
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:14,404
- Ew, that's one ugly dude.
- Hot?

838
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:18,074
Oh, that's Vigo. Mr. Vigo? Vigs,
would you look this way, please?

839
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:23,037
No, don't. No! No!
No photographs, please.

840
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:26,332
Slides are available
in the gift shop.

841
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:28,501
Yeah, thanks. Thank you, Winston.

842
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:31,170
All right. You know what?
Give me angry, will you?

843
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:33,840
Give me angry. You've had a bad day.
You're cranky. Yeah, thank you.

844
00:51:33,841 --> 00:51:35,967
Good, good. Ooh, angrier.

845
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:39,512
I'm scared. You're scaring me.
Stop it. Yeah. Good!

846
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:42,515
Okay, walk for me, talk
for me. Yeah, yeah!

847
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:45,018
Okay, give me hot and sexy.

848
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:48,980
Can you do it? You can. Oh, boy.
Show me some teeth. Come on.

849
00:51:48,981 --> 00:51:51,608
I bet the girls like you,
huh? Do the girls?

850
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:54,027
Do the guys? Bet they both do, huh?

851
00:51:54,028 --> 00:51:56,988
What about the animals?
They like you? That's it, more!

852
00:51:56,989 --> 00:52:00,199
Yeah, come on! You're big, you're big.
All right, destroy me. Destroy me!

853
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:04,370
Yeah! Destroy me.
Yeah, yeah! Give it, give it!

854
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:07,715
Venkman, we need to talk. Come on.

855
00:52:09,043 --> 00:52:13,889
I've worked with better.
But not many. Thank you.

856
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:16,349
John, thanks.

857
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:22,388
- Hey. Hey, you finished?
- Yeah, I'm finished here.

858
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:25,183
- Are you all right?
- What?

859
00:52:25,184 --> 00:52:27,018
I mean, you're not coming
down with something?

860
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:28,566
Me?

861
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:40,415
Dana. Your prince.

862
00:52:46,622 --> 00:52:48,590
Oh, no.

863
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:53,252
Oh, no. Oh, no.

864
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:55,296
She cleaned.

865
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:58,174
- Hi.
- Hi.

866
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:01,144
Shh. He's asleep. Come here.

867
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:05,765
- So what happened with my apartment?
- Well,

868
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:07,934
the guys spent the
whole night there.

869
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:10,395
They went through all your
things, your personal stuff,

870
00:53:10,396 --> 00:53:13,981
they tried on some of your clothes,
made some long-distance phone calls,

871
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:17,735
- cleaned out the fridge.
- Did they find anything?

872
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:20,029
They found a little bit
of that pink slime.

873
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:24,534
Oh, God. Well, what am
I supposed to do now?

874
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:28,496
You are supposed to get
dressed and get crazy with me

875
00:53:28,497 --> 00:53:31,124
- on the streets of Manhattan.
- I don't think...

876
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:34,961
This is exactly what you need.
I have got you a babysitter.

877
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:38,423
- The whole thing's wired.
- I don't think we should go on a date.

878
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:42,428
You know, and I can't leave
Oscar in a strange place

879
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,892
with a strange person.

880
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:50,228
Strange person? Janine
Melnitz, from my staff.

881
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:54,647
Janine has experience babysitting?

882
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:56,570
Here.

883
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,986
Thank you.

884
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:03,322
I've also brought some
things from your apartment.

885
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:06,951
Some wardrobe choices. A couple
of provocative ensembles in here.

886
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:09,620
- I'll leave it up to you.
- Okay, but after dinner.

887
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:12,373
Don't put any of those old
cheap moves on me, okay?

888
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:14,000
- No, no, no.
- It's different.

889
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:17,380
I have all new cheap moves.

890
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:22,925
Hey, you. Hey, you.

891
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:26,679
It looks like you're awake,
huh? You're awake.

892
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,222
Yes, Osco.

893
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:30,933
You're gonna have the whole
place to yourself tonight, pal.

894
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,685
It's gonna be pretty neat.

895
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:36,647
I got some Laura Antonelli
tapes if you wanna watch them.

896
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:39,859
Dana, did you see some shirts here

897
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:43,362
- in the floor-bed area?
- Yeah, I put them in the hamper.

898
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:46,532
- I have a hamper?
- Yeah, it's in the bathroom.

899
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,535
Neat.

900
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:51,370
Will you tell me next time you're
gonna do that, though, please?

901
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:53,544
Well, I thought they were dirty.

902
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:56,501
I have more than two
grades of laundry, okay?

903
00:54:56,502 --> 00:55:01,883
There's not just clean and dirty.
There are many subtle levels, okay?

904
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:05,885
You hang this outside the
window for 20 minutes,

905
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:08,054
it's perfectly fine.

906
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:11,308
Interesting role model
for you, Oscar, huh?

907
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:20,025
Well, they couldn't get to you
until after the New Year.

908
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:23,237
Well, just don't go in there.

909
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:27,909
Louis, I'm closing up!

910
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:31,911
Well, should I take the
subway or the surface roads?

911
00:55:31,912 --> 00:55:36,258
- Or what? It's kind of busy...
- Well, I'm walking. Good night.

912
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:40,420
Well, now. Well,
well, hang on, now.

913
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:43,714
Do you maybe wanna...? No, no.

914
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:46,809
Do you wanna have
something to eat with me?

915
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:49,178
Well, yeah, I'd love that.

916
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:52,765
But I told Dr. Venkman
I'd babysit for him.

917
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:56,941
- Oh, well...
- Do you wanna babysit with me?

918
00:55:57,354 --> 00:56:00,773
- Okay. I would.
- Great. His place at 8.

919
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,859
- Bye.
- His place at 8. All right.

920
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:06,364
- I can get his address from the W2...
- Hey, buddy. Move it!

921
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:15,663
We were right, Ray. Multi-planar
Kirlian emanations.

922
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:18,291
Yeah, well, here's your
next month's cover of GQ.

923
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:20,794
Check out the aura on this sucker.

924
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:24,297
Now, there's definitely
a living presence there.

925
00:56:24,298 --> 00:56:26,215
We should get a deeper look.

926
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:28,801
Why don't I run this wider shot
through the spectral analyzer.

927
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:31,805
Good, I'll try turning
up the roentgens.

928
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:35,725
So, what do you think? Chinese?

929
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:38,603
- How about Thai?
- No, it's too spicy.

930
00:56:38,604 --> 00:56:41,147
- Greek?
- Mexican?

931
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:43,024
- Pizza.
- Thin or thick?

932
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:44,902
Chicago.

933
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:51,287
What the hell is that?

934
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,957
I know what it is.

935
00:56:57,164 --> 00:56:59,666
- I've seen it before.
- Where?

936
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:02,376
When you guys had me dangling
like a worm on a hook

937
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:04,925
a hundred feet below First Avenue.

938
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:08,891
That's the river of slime.

939
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:14,263
Ray.

940
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,474
We need a blanket or
a hose or something.

941
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:18,227
Get out.

942
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:20,478
Why is this closed?

943
00:57:20,479 --> 00:57:23,448
Winston! Winston!

944
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:25,191
- Fire!
- Back away, back away.

945
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:28,195
What are we gonna do,
put our heads in the toilet?

946
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:47,339
Taxi!

947
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:55,221
Pete, it's great that you're here.
We've got incredible news.

948
00:57:55,222 --> 00:57:57,723
Wait a minute. Can I have one try?

949
00:57:57,724 --> 00:58:00,393
All-you-can-eat barbecue
rib night at the Sizzler?

950
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:02,550
No. We analyzed the
photos you took of Vigo.

951
00:58:02,576 --> 00:58:05,126
The spectrogram shows a river
of slime flowing behind him.

952
00:58:05,152 --> 00:58:08,280
Just like the one I saw underground. We're
going into the subway and sewer system

953
00:58:08,281 --> 00:58:09,652
to see if we can trace
the source of the flow.

954
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:11,570
Yeah, come on. Change your
clothes. We'll wait for you.

955
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:14,448
Yeah, Egon thinks there might even
be a tremendous breeding surge

956
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:18,327
- in the cockroach population.
- Hi, boys. What's up?

957
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:21,414
Hi.

958
00:58:21,415 --> 00:58:25,334
Dana, the guys are going down into
the sewer to check for slime stuff.

959
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:29,588
And Egon thinks there may even be
a huge surge in cockroach breeding.

960
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:33,764
Wanna blow off this dinner
thing and go with them?

961
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:38,603
Taxi!

962
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:43,812
Women, huh?

963
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:54,956
Will you watch your step?

964
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,784
I hate this.

965
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:02,830
According to this old transit map, there
should be an entrance along here somewhere.

966
00:59:02,831 --> 00:59:04,957
I'm not getting anything yet.

967
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:09,086
Well, at least it's too dark
to see the cockroaches.

968
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:12,673
Forget about cockroaches. It's the
subway rats you gotta worry about.

969
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:14,091
Big as beavers.

970
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:16,302
Yeah, some of them go 4 or 5 kilos.

971
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:18,137
Hey, hey. Enough, all right?

972
00:59:18,138 --> 00:59:20,931
Listen. You can hear
them behind the walls,

973
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:23,893
scratching. There must
be thousands of them.

974
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:27,864
- Just shut up about the rats.
- Okay, okay.

975
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:32,114
Hello!

976
00:59:37,866 --> 00:59:39,366
Hey!

977
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:44,589
Hello!

978
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:52,381
<i>Winston.</i>

979
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:54,970
Okay, I'm out of here.

980
01:00:09,481 --> 01:00:11,190
They're gone.

981
01:00:11,191 --> 01:00:12,566
What the...?

982
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:15,611
Before we go any further, I think
we should get our proton packs.

983
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:17,489
Good idea.

984
01:00:27,249 --> 01:00:29,717
- What's that?
- What's what?

985
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:32,253
Sounds like a train.

986
01:00:32,254 --> 01:00:36,966
Uh-uh. These lines have been
abandoned for 50 years.

987
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:39,014
Oh.

988
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:52,565
Probably in one of the
tunnels above us.

989
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:54,739
I don't know.

990
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:57,950
It sounds awfully close to me.

991
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:25,264
I think that was the old New
York Central, City of Albany.

992
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:27,766
Derailed in 1920, killed
hundreds of people.

993
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:30,060
Did you catch the number
on the locomotive?

994
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:33,064
Sorry. I missed it.

995
01:01:35,567 --> 01:01:39,162
Something's trying to
stop us. We must be close.

996
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:42,532
Where's Ray?

997
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:45,959
- Ray?
- Ray?

998
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:48,329
- Ray!
- Ray?

999
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:50,873
- Ray?
- Ray.

1000
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:52,666
Guys!

1001
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:55,461
- What?
- Oh, sorry. I found it.

1002
01:01:55,462 --> 01:01:57,588
- Right here. There's a hole.
- Let's go.

1003
01:01:57,589 --> 01:02:01,468
Hey, fellas, what about the packs?
What about the packs?

1004
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:18,985
Unbelievable.

1005
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:24,165
Uh-huh. Did I tell you?
I wasn't lying, was I?

1006
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:29,912
You know how much negative energy it must
have taken to generate a flow this size?

1007
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:32,915
New York, what a town.

1008
01:02:32,916 --> 01:02:34,875
All right. Let's see
how deep it is.

1009
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:37,094
- Get a sounding.
- Yeah.

1010
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:43,301
All right, 6 feet.

1011
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:46,845
- Twelve feet.
- Twelve?

1012
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:48,722
- Something's pulling it.
- Hold on!

1013
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:50,683
- Well, I'm trying to hold it.
- Ray, help him.

1014
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:53,352
- Give me a hand. Give me a hand!
- Ray, help.

1015
01:02:53,353 --> 01:02:55,855
- It's got ahold of him.
- Get his belt off!

1016
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:58,399
- I can't hold it!
- Wait, wait, hold...

1017
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:17,167
A toast to the most charming,

1018
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:20,379
- kindest...
- Oh, it's me.

1019
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:24,383
It's you. And most unusual man

1020
01:03:24,384 --> 01:03:26,886
I've ever broken up with.

1021
01:03:36,396 --> 01:03:38,731
Speaking of breaking
up with neat guys,

1022
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:42,985
- why did you dump me?
- I didn't dump you. I was

1023
01:03:42,986 --> 01:03:44,903
protecting myself.

1024
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:48,078
I mean, you weren't very
good for me, you know.

1025
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:50,576
You know that, don't you?

1026
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:52,411
Heck, I'm not even good for me.

1027
01:03:52,412 --> 01:03:56,665
You're much better than you realize.
You don't give yourself enough credit.

1028
01:03:56,666 --> 01:04:00,461
I need to hear that kind of stuff.
If I had this kind of support

1029
01:04:00,462 --> 01:04:03,756
on a 24-hour-a-day basis,
I could whip myself into shape

1030
01:04:03,757 --> 01:04:05,841
by the end of this century.

1031
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:10,017
Well, why don't you just give
me a jingle in the year 2000.

1032
01:04:12,932 --> 01:04:16,436
Why don't I give you
a jingle right now?

1033
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:25,361
So the seven little dwarves had a limited
partnership in a small mining operation.

1034
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:28,113
And one day a beautiful princess
came to live with them.

1035
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:32,107
They bartered housekeeping services for
room and board. Which was a real good deal,

1036
01:04:32,108 --> 01:04:35,162
because they didn't have to withhold
social security or income tax or nothing.

1037
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:39,083
Which you're really not supposed to do, you
see, but for the purposes of this story...

1038
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:41,460
It really is a great place.

1039
01:04:41,461 --> 01:04:43,420
I mean, it needs a woman's touch,

1040
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:46,882
but I think it looks really
good. You know...

1041
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:49,477
Shh. Bedtime.

1042
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:52,096
You're very good with children.

1043
01:04:52,097 --> 01:04:54,691
Thanks. I practiced on my hamster.

1044
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,896
So you live alone?

1045
01:05:01,481 --> 01:05:05,406
I used to have a roommate,
but my mom moved to Florida.

1046
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:10,322
Why don't you come over
here and sit with me.

1047
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:12,166
Okay.

1048
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:16,870
So you wanna play Boggle
or Super Mario Brothers?

1049
01:05:16,871 --> 01:05:18,964
You know...

1050
01:05:19,332 --> 01:05:23,757
I think motherhood's a
very natural instinct.

1051
01:05:23,837 --> 01:05:26,465
I'd like a child myself.

1052
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:29,591
Would you?

1053
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:31,719
Tonight?

1054
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,830
Nice going. Ray.

1055
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:54,032
What are you trying
to do, drown me?

1056
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:56,285
Oh, Yeah, Zeddmore,
like it was my fault.

1057
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:59,121
You were too stupid not
to drop that plumb line!

1058
01:05:59,122 --> 01:06:01,290
Stupid? You better watch your
mouth or I'll punch your lights out.

1059
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:02,708
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

1060
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:04,376
- Well, anytime!
- Come on!

1061
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:07,045
It's go time, man. I want you bad!

1062
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:08,798
Come on!

1063
01:06:09,007 --> 01:06:11,134
Wait! Wait!

1064
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:15,351
Stop, stop. Get your
clothes off, quick. Strip.

1065
01:06:22,145 --> 01:06:26,356
Oh, dear. Ray, what were we
doing? I was ready to kill you.

1066
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:30,277
It's this stuff. It's like pure,
concentrated evil.

1067
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:33,372
And it's all flowing
right to this spot.

1068
01:06:42,207 --> 01:06:44,750
- You sure this is it?
- Yeah, he said Armand's.

1069
01:06:44,751 --> 01:06:47,925
- Excuse me...
- It's all right. We'll look in the back.

1070
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:50,181
Venkman!

1071
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:53,258
Hey, Venkman!

1072
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:56,011
Please leave. You cannot...
Get out of my restaurant!

1073
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:59,348
It was absolutely incredible!
The greatest tangible evidence

1074
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:01,934
of psychic energy in 100 years.

1075
01:07:01,935 --> 01:07:05,437
- You're disturbing our guests!
- This is an emergency. One second.

1076
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:09,650
Boys, you're scaring the straights, okay?
Is there any way we can do this tomorrow?

1077
01:07:09,651 --> 01:07:13,278
No, this won't wait until tomorrow,
Venkman. It's hot and it's ready to pop.

1078
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:15,447
- Yeah. It's all over the city, Pete.
- Under it, actually.

1079
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:18,534
- Rivers of this stuff.
- It's all flowing right to the museum.

1080
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:20,628
Yeah, the museum!

1081
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:23,539
Look what he got all over me!
What is this stuff?

1082
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:27,876
- Sorry.
- Oh, God. You mean my museum?

1083
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:32,339
I was gonna tell you between the
dessert and the cheese course.

1084
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:34,800
- There they are!
- You can never go back there.

1085
01:07:34,801 --> 01:07:39,513
- You're gonna have to find a new job.
- Psychomagnotheric plasma.

1086
01:07:39,514 --> 01:07:42,724
- It affects behavior. We were fighting.
- We were in a fight.

1087
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:45,936
He had him by the throat...

1088
01:07:45,937 --> 01:07:48,855
I'm glad they're here.
We gotta see the mayor.

1089
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:54,236
<i>♪ Well, I guess we're gonna
Have to take control ♪</i>

1094
01:08:04,998 --> 01:08:06,832
- Oh, Ghostbusters!
- How you doing?

1095
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:09,836
Hey, guys, come right this way.

1096
01:08:09,961 --> 01:08:13,589
You guys got another one of those proton
packs? My kid brother really wants one.

1097
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:16,889
- The proton pack is not a toy.
- I guess he's right.

1098
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:25,230
Ah.

1099
01:08:29,731 --> 01:08:31,857
Dana, we were just
babysitting, honest.

1100
01:08:31,858 --> 01:08:35,152
And we watched some TV and had something to
eat and then and one thing led to another.

1101
01:08:35,153 --> 01:08:38,697
- I know what you were doing.
- I didn't know anything would happen.

1102
01:08:38,698 --> 01:08:41,116
Hi, Dana. How was your date?

1103
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:44,453
- It wasn't a date, it was just dinner.
- Well, where's Peter?

1104
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:46,877
He was arrested.

1105
01:08:47,165 --> 01:08:49,374
Typical.

1106
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:52,469
- Did he call?
- No, no. Nobody called.

1107
01:08:53,421 --> 01:08:55,839
Well, how's Oscar? Is he all right?

1108
01:08:55,840 --> 01:09:00,311
Oh, he's fine. Such a good baby.

1109
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:02,220
He was a little fussy at first,

1110
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:05,390
then we just gave him
some French bread pizza,

1111
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:07,143
passed right out.

1112
01:09:08,853 --> 01:09:13,733
Good. Good. Well, I'll
just give him a look-see.

1113
01:09:25,244 --> 01:09:28,163
- So you think we should go?
- Gee, I don't know.

1114
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:31,458
I don't think we should
leave her alone.

1115
01:09:31,459 --> 01:09:34,132
You're right. Let's stay.

1116
01:09:37,924 --> 01:09:41,885
- Lenny! Big man!
- Ghostbusters.

1117
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:43,979
Mr. Mayor.

1118
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:47,891
What is this? A slumber party?

1119
01:09:47,892 --> 01:09:49,976
That's what we're
here to talk about.

1120
01:09:49,977 --> 01:09:52,896
Look, I don't wanna hear
anything about it.

1121
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:56,116
You've got two minutes.
Make it good.

1122
01:09:57,652 --> 01:10:02,447
Well, first of all, Mr. Mayor, it's
a great pleasure to see you again.

1123
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:06,535
We'd like to say that almost 50 percent
of us voted for you in the last election.

1124
01:10:06,536 --> 01:10:09,121
- I appreciate that.
- I'm just sorry we always meet

1125
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:10,956
under these circumstances.

1126
01:10:10,957 --> 01:10:14,710
Mr. Mayor, we're here tonight because
a psychomagnotheric slime flow

1127
01:10:14,711 --> 01:10:17,963
of immense proportions is
building up beneath the city.

1128
01:10:17,964 --> 01:10:20,090
- Psycho-what?
- Psychomagnotheric.

1129
01:10:20,091 --> 01:10:21,800
- Big word.
- Negative human emotions

1130
01:10:21,801 --> 01:10:25,053
are materializing in the form of
a viscous, psychoreactive plasm

1131
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:27,472
with explosive
supernormal potential.

1132
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:29,391
Does anybody speak English here?

1133
01:10:29,392 --> 01:10:32,561
Yeah, Your Honor, what we're
trying to tell you is, like,

1134
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:35,439
all the bad feelings, I mean,
all the hate, the anger and violence

1135
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:38,150
of this city is turning
into this sludge.

1136
01:10:38,151 --> 01:10:41,236
I didn't believe it at first either,
but we just went for a swim in it,

1137
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:43,280
and we ended up almost
killing each other.

1138
01:10:43,281 --> 01:10:46,199
This is insane! I mean, do we
really have to listen to this?

1139
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:50,036
Can't you stop your lips from
flapping for two little minutes?

1140
01:10:50,037 --> 01:10:52,956
Lenny, have you been
out on the street lately?

1141
01:10:52,957 --> 01:10:56,334
Do you know how weird it is out there?
We've taken our own head count.

1142
01:10:56,335 --> 01:11:00,547
There seem to be 3 million
completely miserable assholes

1143
01:11:00,548 --> 01:11:05,343
- living in the Tri-State area.
- Oh, please.

1144
01:11:05,344 --> 01:11:07,846
I beg your pardon.
3 million and one.

1145
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:11,767
What budgie-brain here doesn't realize
is that if we don't do something fast,

1146
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:14,603
this whole place is gonna blow
like a frog on a hot plate.

1147
01:11:14,604 --> 01:11:17,647
- Yeah, right.
- What am I supposed to do?

1148
01:11:17,648 --> 01:11:20,108
Go on television and
tell 10 million people

1149
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:23,579
they have to be nice to each other?

1150
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:27,449
Being miserable and treating
other people like dirt

1151
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:31,036
is every New Yorker's
God-given right.

1152
01:11:31,037 --> 01:11:33,830
Your two minutes are up.
Good night, gentlemen.

1153
01:11:33,831 --> 01:11:36,208
- Wait.
- You're making a mistake, Mr. Mayor.

1154
01:11:36,209 --> 01:11:39,544
A very newsworthy mistake. <i>The
Times</i> is gonna be interested in this,

1155
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:42,547
- and you know <i>The Post...</i>
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Now, now...

1156
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:44,382
"Mayor Drowns in River of Slime."

1157
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:47,636
- "Times Square Slime."
- "Slime Square."

1158
01:11:47,637 --> 01:11:52,098
Fine. Now, before you go running
off to the newspapers with this,

1159
01:11:52,099 --> 01:11:56,854
would you consider telling this slime
business to some of our people downtown?

1160
01:11:58,064 --> 01:12:00,737
It's gotta be done right away.

1161
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:03,527
Well, it's gonna come back!

1162
01:12:03,528 --> 01:12:06,196
This city's in danger!
The whole state! The world!

1163
01:12:06,197 --> 01:12:10,575
- All we wanna do is help!
- I'm warning you.

1164
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:14,329
The mayor wants them kept under strict
observation for the next few days.

1165
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:17,916
We think they're seriously disturbed
and potentially dangerous.

1166
01:12:17,917 --> 01:12:21,762
- Well, we'll do whatever's necessary.
- Thank you, doctor.

1167
01:12:25,258 --> 01:12:28,510
I await the word of Vigo.

1168
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:30,595
I, Vigo,

1169
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:34,516
- the scourge of Carpathia,
- No, you told me this, the scourge.

1170
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:38,270
- the sorrow of Moldavia,
- Sorrows, I've heard all of this, yes.

1171
01:12:38,271 --> 01:12:42,107
- command you.
- Command me, lord.

1172
01:12:42,108 --> 01:12:47,445
The season of evil begins with
the birth of the new year.

1173
01:12:47,446 --> 01:12:48,864
Good.

1174
01:12:48,865 --> 01:12:52,576
Bring me the child,
that I might live again.

1175
01:12:52,577 --> 01:12:55,000
Yes!

1176
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:59,382
Lord Vigo...

1177
01:13:00,251 --> 01:13:02,628
I was wondering.

1178
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:07,132
This woman, Dana,
is fine and strong.

1179
01:13:07,133 --> 01:13:08,800
Now...

1180
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:13,555
if I was to

1181
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:15,348
bring the baby,

1182
01:13:15,349 --> 01:13:18,728
could I have that woman?

1183
01:13:19,854 --> 01:13:22,480
So be it.

1184
01:13:22,481 --> 01:13:27,485
On this day of darkness,
she will be ours.

1185
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:32,908
Wife to you and mother to me.

1186
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:34,326
Yes!

1187
01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:37,171
Thank you, lord! Thank you.

1188
01:13:39,874 --> 01:13:44,461
- I mean, is she the killer or what?
- No, that's Rita Hayworth.

1189
01:13:44,462 --> 01:13:47,881
She was married to Citizen Kane
while they were doing this thing.

1190
01:13:47,882 --> 01:13:52,677
Right after they finished, she dumped
him for some polo player. Thanks.

1191
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:56,097
I don't know why beautiful women love
horses so much. Do you love horses?

1192
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:58,350
- No.
- You really don't have to stay.

1193
01:13:58,351 --> 01:14:00,310
I'm sure Peter will be back soon.

1194
01:14:00,311 --> 01:14:02,270
Oh, we don't mind.

1195
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:04,356
Can you see okay?

1196
01:14:04,357 --> 01:14:06,859
Yep.

1197
01:14:48,776 --> 01:14:51,074
Oscar?

1198
01:14:58,577 --> 01:15:00,374
Oh, God!

1199
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:03,048
Oscar!

1200
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:05,083
Louis!

1201
01:15:05,084 --> 01:15:07,928
- What?
- It's Oscar!

1202
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:14,300
- Oscar.
- Call 911 right now!

1203
01:15:31,569 --> 01:15:33,286
Oscar.

1204
01:15:33,487 --> 01:15:36,160
Oh, no.

1205
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:47,551
Oh, God. No!

1206
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:54,258
No!

1207
01:15:58,637 --> 01:16:00,221
- It was a ghost!
- No.

1208
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:02,474
- No, that was Janosz.
- What?

1209
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:05,351
- He took him.
- What? What's happening?

1210
01:16:05,352 --> 01:16:07,395
- What should we do?
- Where's the baby?

1211
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:09,489
The museum!

1212
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:13,285
- Where are you going?
- I've gotta get my baby!

1213
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:16,492
We gotta find the guys.

1214
01:16:16,947 --> 01:16:18,948
As I explained before,

1215
01:16:18,949 --> 01:16:22,160
we think the spirit of a
17th-century Moldavian tyrant

1216
01:16:22,161 --> 01:16:25,997
is alive and well in a painting
at the Manhattan Museum of Art.

1217
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:29,959
And are there any other paintings in
the museum with bad spirits in them?

1218
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:33,088
You're wasting valuable time.
He's drawing strength from

1219
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:36,883
a psychomagnotheric slime flow that's
been collecting under the city.

1220
01:16:36,884 --> 01:16:40,053
- Yes, tell me about the slime.
- It's very potent stuff.

1221
01:16:40,054 --> 01:16:42,932
We made a toaster dance with it.

1222
01:16:43,057 --> 01:16:45,517
And a bathtub tried to
eat his friend's baby.

1223
01:16:45,518 --> 01:16:47,645
A bathtub?

1224
01:16:48,187 --> 01:16:51,816
Don't look at me. I think these
people are completely nuts.

1225
01:18:09,268 --> 01:18:11,520
Oscar.

1226
01:18:14,064 --> 01:18:16,316
Sweetheart.

1227
01:18:19,111 --> 01:18:23,036
I thought I'd lost you, that
I'd never see you again.

1228
01:18:23,824 --> 01:18:26,076
Oh, baby.

1229
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:29,287
Hello, Dana. I thought
that you might come.

1230
01:18:29,288 --> 01:18:31,956
You stay away from
us, Janosz. I mean it.

1231
01:18:31,957 --> 01:18:34,667
Oh, don't worry. He
will not be harmed.

1232
01:18:34,668 --> 01:18:36,628
He has been chosen

1233
01:18:36,629 --> 01:18:40,590
to be the vessel of
the spirit of Vigo.

1234
01:18:40,591 --> 01:18:45,722
And you will be the mother
of the ruler of the world.

1235
01:18:46,096 --> 01:18:47,722
Doesn't that sound nice?

1236
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:50,683
No, it sounds ludicrous.

1237
01:18:50,684 --> 01:18:53,269
You stay away from him. I mean it.

1238
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:57,148
Well, I don't think we have
choice here, yes? Take a look.

1239
01:18:57,149 --> 01:18:59,943
It's not Gainsborough's
<i>Blue Boy</i> there, huh?

1240
01:18:59,944 --> 01:19:01,486
He is Vigo.

1241
01:19:01,487 --> 01:19:03,071
I don't care who he is.

1242
01:19:03,072 --> 01:19:06,075
You're not gonna take my baby.

1243
01:19:13,457 --> 01:19:15,675
Oscar!

1244
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:17,844
Oh, you bastard!

or a little dinosaur?

1258
01:20:18,564 --> 01:20:20,565
A skeleton? Which
way was it heading?

1259
01:20:20,566 --> 01:20:23,067
Wait a sec. What was
chasing you in the park?

1260
01:20:23,068 --> 01:20:25,028
The park bench was chasing you?

1261
01:20:25,029 --> 01:20:26,612
- I see.
- What?

1262
01:20:26,613 --> 01:20:28,031
Wait a second.

1263
01:20:28,032 --> 01:20:30,575
Lieutenant, I think you
better talk to this guy.

1264
01:20:30,576 --> 01:20:31,993
I'm busy here.

1265
01:20:31,994 --> 01:20:34,704
It's some dock supervisor
down at Pier 34.

1266
01:20:34,705 --> 01:20:36,080
What's the problem?

1267
01:20:36,081 --> 01:20:39,425
He says the <i>Titanic</i> just arrived.

1268
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:50,937
Well, better late than never.

1269
01:20:54,058 --> 01:20:57,977
We're swamped. We've had more than
3000 calls since midnight last night.

1270
01:20:57,978 --> 01:21:01,939
We've got every man in uniform on
the streets and I'm still shorthanded.

1271
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:04,525
We've got meter maids chasing
ghosts all over midtown.

1272
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:08,446
There's this shell thing over the Manhattan
Museum of Art. We can't make a dent.

1273
01:21:08,447 --> 01:21:11,115
- Have you tried dynamite?
- We've tried everything.

1274
01:21:11,116 --> 01:21:14,452
What the hell's going on?
It's pandemonium out there.

1275
01:21:14,453 --> 01:21:17,622
- I know. We're working on it.
- Great. While you're working on it,

1276
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:20,291
I'm going down in history as
the mayor who let New York

1277
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:22,877
get sucked down into
the 10th level of hell.

1278
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:25,296
All right. We've got no choice.
Call the Ghostbusters.

1279
01:21:25,297 --> 01:21:27,090
Wait!

1280
01:21:27,091 --> 01:21:29,884
Now, I'm sure there's another way.

1281
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:34,847
Jack, I spent an hour last night in my
bedroom talking to Fiorello La Guardia,

1282
01:21:34,848 --> 01:21:37,642
and he's been dead for 40 years.

1283
01:21:37,643 --> 01:21:40,646
Now, where are the Ghostbusters?

1284
01:21:42,314 --> 01:21:44,065
They're not available.

1285
01:21:44,066 --> 01:21:46,568
What do you mean,
they're not available?

1286
01:21:47,486 --> 01:21:52,742
Well, I had them committed to the
psychiatric ward at Parkview Hospital.

1287
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:55,493
- You what?
- They threatened to go to the press.

1288
01:21:55,494 --> 01:21:57,495
I was protecting your interests.

1289
01:21:57,496 --> 01:22:00,498
Yeah? Well, you can stop
protecting my interests.

1290
01:22:00,499 --> 01:22:03,918
You have exactly three minutes
to clear out. You're fired!

1291
01:22:03,919 --> 01:22:05,378
But the election...

1292
01:22:05,379 --> 01:22:07,839
- Remove this man.
- You're making a mistake.

1293
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:12,593
- And get me the Ghostbusters!
- Mr. Mayor, come take a look at this.

1294
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:14,512
Wow.

1295
01:22:14,513 --> 01:22:16,686
What is it?

1296
01:22:17,391 --> 01:22:19,768
Have you ever seen
anything like that?

1297
01:22:34,491 --> 01:22:37,243
Somebody get me the Ghostbusters.

1298
01:22:38,537 --> 01:22:41,080
Then he put the baby in a
carriage and then levitated away.

1299
01:22:41,081 --> 01:22:42,665
Where did Dana go?

1300
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:45,126
She was going to the museum
to get the baby back.

1301
01:22:45,127 --> 01:22:49,046
Then there was an eclipse. The whole
town went dark and everybody's nuts.

1302
01:22:49,047 --> 01:22:52,008
It all fits. Vigo wants
in on the 21st century.

1303
01:22:52,009 --> 01:22:54,719
He needs a human body to
inhabit. Little Oscar must be it.

1304
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:56,679
And I bet we're the
only ones who can help.

1305
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:58,014
You bet we are.

1316
01:23:33,342 --> 01:23:36,886
it looks like a giant Jell-O mold.

1317
01:23:36,887 --> 01:23:38,262
I hate Jell-O.

1318
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:41,107
Oh, come on. There's
always room for Jell-O.

1319
01:23:44,561 --> 01:23:49,612
Soon it will be midnight and the
city will be mine and Vigo's.

1320
01:23:51,068 --> 01:23:53,787
Well, mainly Vigo's.

1321
01:23:53,946 --> 01:23:55,363
Dana.

1322
01:23:55,364 --> 01:23:59,951
You and I have this terrific opportunity
to make the best of this relationship.

1323
01:23:59,952 --> 01:24:02,078
We don't have a relationship.

1324
01:24:02,079 --> 01:24:04,664
I know! Marry me, Dana.

1325
01:24:04,665 --> 01:24:07,293
Together we will raise
Vigo as our son.

1326
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:12,296
And let me tell you something here.

1327
01:24:12,297 --> 01:24:16,842
There are many perks in being
the mother of a living god.

1328
01:24:16,843 --> 01:24:20,096
I'm sure we could get a
magnificent apartment,

1329
01:24:20,138 --> 01:24:23,437
a car, free parking.

1330
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:28,187
Many marriages begin with a
certain amount of distance.

1331
01:24:28,188 --> 01:24:32,659
Yet I think that perhaps
you and I could learn...

1332
01:24:32,818 --> 01:24:34,820
to love each other?

1333
01:24:36,655 --> 01:24:38,782
Yes.

1334
01:24:39,366 --> 01:24:41,914
I could learn.

1335
01:24:51,795 --> 01:24:54,013
Pull them.

1336
01:24:55,632 --> 01:24:57,634
Full neutronas.

1337
01:24:59,428 --> 01:25:01,680
Let's cook!

1338
01:25:15,694 --> 01:25:17,946
Save them.

1339
01:25:26,872 --> 01:25:29,206
That slime wall is
pulsing with evil.

1340
01:25:29,207 --> 01:25:32,793
It would take a tremendous amount
of positive energy to crack that shell

1341
01:25:32,794 --> 01:25:36,548
and I seriously doubt that there's enough
goodwill left in this town to do it.

1342
01:25:37,049 --> 01:25:41,218
I just can't believe things have gotten so
bad in this city that there's no way back.

1343
01:25:41,219 --> 01:25:43,804
I mean, sure, it's dirty, it's
crowded, it's polluted, it's noisy,

1344
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:47,933
and there's people all around who'd just
as soon step on your face as look at you.

1345
01:25:47,934 --> 01:25:49,810
But come on!

1346
01:25:49,811 --> 01:25:53,481
There gotta be a few sparks of sweet
humanity left in this burned-out burg.

1347
01:25:53,482 --> 01:25:55,816
We just have to figure
out a way to mobilize it.

1348
01:25:55,817 --> 01:26:00,572
He's right. We need something that everyone
in this town can get behind. We need...

1349
01:26:03,909 --> 01:26:06,252
A symbol.

1350
01:26:07,245 --> 01:26:10,373
Something that appeals to the
best in each and every one of us.

1351
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:13,092
Something good.

1352
01:26:13,251 --> 01:26:14,710
Something decent.

1353
01:26:14,711 --> 01:26:16,963
Something pure.

1354
01:26:30,727 --> 01:26:32,853
Kind of makes you
wonder, doesn't it?

1355
01:26:32,854 --> 01:26:34,271
Wonder what?

1356
01:26:34,272 --> 01:26:36,899
Whether she's naked
under that toga.

1357
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:40,449
She's French. You know that.

1358
01:26:41,279 --> 01:26:42,655
Got it.

1359
01:26:42,656 --> 01:26:45,449
Ready with the speakers,
Ray. Slime blowers ready.

1360
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:48,786
Okay. Internal audio set.
Internal electric set.

1361
01:26:48,787 --> 01:26:51,163
Slime blower primed and set.

1362
01:26:51,164 --> 01:26:54,542
Ooh, good slime. Good slime. Winston,
is our slime in a good mood tonight?

1363
01:26:54,543 --> 01:26:57,086
I hope so. She's a lot
bigger than a toaster.

1364
01:26:57,087 --> 01:26:58,349
All yours, Venkman. Let's go.

1365
01:26:58,375 --> 01:27:00,289
Thank you. Testing,
one, two, testing.

1366
01:27:00,315 --> 01:27:02,675
Hey, how many of you people here
tonight are a national monument?

1367
01:27:02,676 --> 01:27:05,219
Would you raise your hand,
please. Oh, hello, miss.

1368
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:08,815
- Let's frost it.
- It's slime time.

1369
01:27:17,023 --> 01:27:18,775
Beautiful.

1370
01:27:33,623 --> 01:27:35,166
Pilot controls are ready.

1371
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:38,544
All right. It's getting late. It's
almost midnight. Let's go, Venkman.

1372
01:27:38,545 --> 01:27:43,215
Here's something off the request
line from Liberty Island!

1373
01:27:43,216 --> 01:27:47,266
We gonna squeeze some New
Year's juice from you, Big Apple.

This should really get the city's
positive energy flowing.

1386
01:28:42,234 --> 01:28:45,152
Keep kicking, Libby.
You make this work,

1387
01:28:45,153 --> 01:28:48,827
we'll pop for a weekend in Vegas
with the Jolly Green Giant.

1388
01:29:00,085 --> 01:29:03,088
You look fantastic in this.

1389
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:07,509
I was born to wear this stuff.

1390
01:29:22,858 --> 01:29:25,281

1404
01:30:20,123 --> 01:30:23,000
- We're running out of time, Ray.
- Can't you go any faster?

1405
01:30:23,001 --> 01:30:25,586
I'm afraid the vibrations
will shake her to pieces.

1406
01:30:25,587 --> 01:30:29,173
- We should have padded her feet.
- They don't make Nikes in her size.

1407
01:30:29,174 --> 01:30:33,019
Don't worry. She's tough.
She's a harbor chick!

1408
01:30:37,265 --> 01:30:40,439
Sorry! My fault!

1409
01:30:41,019 --> 01:30:43,066
Happy New Year.

1410
01:30:43,688 --> 01:30:47,692
Stay fit. Keep sharp.
Make good decisions.

1411
01:30:50,362 --> 01:30:52,571
Oh, good. Oh, good. Oh, good.

1412
01:30:52,572 --> 01:30:54,790
Okay.

1413
01:30:58,703 --> 01:31:00,830
Oh, it's you.

1414
01:31:01,164 --> 01:31:05,385
Okay, but I didn't know
you had your license.

1415
01:31:05,669 --> 01:31:08,671
Four minutes to go, and then

1416
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:10,389
party times.

1417
01:31:20,850 --> 01:31:23,060
It's happening.

1418
01:31:23,061 --> 01:31:25,734
It's really happening.

1419
01:31:30,402 --> 01:31:32,904
No. No!

1420
01:31:33,238 --> 01:31:35,536
Go away from here!

1421
01:31:39,911 --> 01:31:43,247
- I love you when you roughhouse!
- Hit it, Mama!

1422
01:31:43,248 --> 01:31:46,672
- Drop the hammer on her!
- Go! Do it now!

1423
01:32:00,265 --> 01:32:03,689
- Oscar, look.
- Go away!

1424
01:32:06,271 --> 01:32:09,189
- Don't know who that is?
- Happy New Year.

1425
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:14,537
He's Vigo! You are like the
buzzing of flies to him!

1426
01:32:16,948 --> 01:32:20,617
Oh, Johnny, did you back the wrong
horse. Will you hose him, please?

1427
01:32:20,618 --> 01:32:23,120
Hose him.

1428
01:32:33,089 --> 01:32:36,217
- One down.
- On the ground.

1429
01:32:38,678 --> 01:32:43,934
- Boy, am I glad to see you.
- Oh, Oscar. Oscar.

1430
01:32:45,101 --> 01:32:46,769
Is he dead?

1431
01:32:46,770 --> 01:32:49,396
Uh-uh. This slime is
positively charged.

1432
01:32:49,397 --> 01:32:51,982
He'll wake up feeling
like a million bucks.

1433
01:32:51,983 --> 01:32:54,068
Whoa, this gentleman
is a little bit ripe.

1434
01:32:54,069 --> 01:32:57,539
That's all right, my friend.
I think I had an accident too.

1435
01:33:16,508 --> 01:33:19,010
Get him away!

1436
01:33:19,177 --> 01:33:22,221
Get a knife or something!
We gotta cut her out of this!

1437
01:33:22,222 --> 01:33:24,019
Okay.

1438
01:33:24,265 --> 01:33:27,367
All right. Now, listen. You
gotta stay right here.

1439
01:33:27,377 --> 01:33:29,689
Don't move. Uncle Pete's gotta
go help your mom for a second.

1440
01:33:29,690 --> 01:33:33,019
You stay here and don't
say anything, okay?

1441
01:33:40,949 --> 01:33:43,076
Uh-oh.

1442
01:33:46,538 --> 01:33:48,540
Hold it right there, deadhead!

1443
01:33:51,668 --> 01:33:54,920
You want a baby? Go ahead and
knock up some willing hellhound.

1444
01:33:54,921 --> 01:33:59,346
Otherwise, I'm giving you three to get
back in that painting where you belong.

1445
01:33:59,926 --> 01:34:01,678
One!

1446
01:34:02,387 --> 01:34:04,480
Two.

1447
01:34:06,558 --> 01:34:08,401
Three!

1448
01:34:09,978 --> 01:34:12,572
You got him! You got him!

1449
01:34:16,401 --> 01:34:19,736
That was really stupid.

1450
01:34:22,073 --> 01:34:24,701
Ray, can you move?

1451
01:34:25,118 --> 01:34:27,995
No. Are you okay?

1452
01:34:27,996 --> 01:34:29,830
No.

1453
01:34:29,831 --> 01:34:32,754
Venkman, how are you?

1454
01:34:33,001 --> 01:34:35,094
I'm fine.

1455
01:34:47,682 --> 01:34:49,600
No.

1456
01:34:49,601 --> 01:34:52,445
No! Oscar.

1457
01:34:53,479 --> 01:34:56,607
Please, do something!

1458
01:34:57,233 --> 01:34:59,735
Not so fast, Vigo!

1459
01:35:00,236 --> 01:35:01,820
Hey, Vigo!

1460
01:35:01,821 --> 01:35:04,698
Yeah, you. The bimbo with the baby.

1461
01:35:04,699 --> 01:35:07,534
Didn't anybody tell you the
big-shoulder look is out?

1462
01:35:07,535 --> 01:35:11,538
You know, I have met some
dumb blonds in my life,

1463
01:35:11,539 --> 01:35:15,088
but you take the taco, pal.

1464
01:35:16,044 --> 01:35:20,631
Only a Carpathian would
come back to life now

1465
01:35:20,632 --> 01:35:23,134
and choose New York.

1466
01:35:23,885 --> 01:35:26,929
Tasty pick, bonehead!

1467
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:32,982
If you had brain one in that
huge melon on top of your neck,

1468
01:35:33,311 --> 01:35:35,646
you would be living the sweet life

1469
01:35:35,647 --> 01:35:41,620
out in Southern California's
beautiful San Fernando Valley.

1470
01:35:47,158 --> 01:35:50,285
Oh, darn it.

1471
01:35:50,286 --> 01:35:54,131
Now we become one.

1472
01:36:02,173 --> 01:36:05,677
- Where's that singing coming from?
- People outside.

1473
01:36:14,227 --> 01:36:17,401
Excuse me. Ghostbusters.

1474
01:36:19,232 --> 01:36:21,405
Wow.

1475
01:36:22,443 --> 01:36:25,071
I'm here with you, guys.

1476
01:36:30,827 --> 01:36:34,376
He's weakening! The singing
is neutralizing the slime!

1477
01:36:35,540 --> 01:36:37,542
I can move!

1478
01:36:39,544 --> 01:36:41,421
Oscar!

1479
01:36:45,758 --> 01:36:47,884
Oh, sweetie.

1480
01:36:47,885 --> 01:36:49,887
It's okay.

1481
01:36:53,391 --> 01:36:55,564
He's back in the painting!

1482
01:36:58,062 --> 01:37:00,735
All right, go find a shady spot.

1483
01:37:08,072 --> 01:37:12,827
Vigie, Vigie, Vigie. You
have been a bad monkey.

1484
01:37:16,831 --> 01:37:20,500
Ray, we'd like to shoot the monster.
Could you move, please?

1485
01:37:20,501 --> 01:37:22,169
- Ray.
- Ray.

1486
01:37:22,170 --> 01:37:23,879
No!

1487
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:27,758
I, Ray and Vigo,
shall rule the Earth!

1488
01:37:27,759 --> 01:37:31,433
- Be gone, you pitiful half-men!
- Now!

1489
01:38:05,254 --> 01:38:08,382
- I did it! I did it!
- That was great!

1490
01:38:08,383 --> 01:38:10,717
- I'm a Ghostbuster!
- I loved it!

1491
01:38:10,718 --> 01:38:14,472
- You all right?
- Come on, get up. Let's get this off.

1492
01:38:14,555 --> 01:38:15,972
Here.

1493
01:38:15,973 --> 01:38:18,225
Here we go.

1494
01:38:19,852 --> 01:38:22,821
- How do you feel?
- Groovy.

1495
01:38:23,147 --> 01:38:26,491
- You all right?
- Yes. Thank you, Peter.

1496
01:38:27,902 --> 01:38:30,404
Spread out, shorty.

1497
01:38:34,951 --> 01:38:38,870
I love you guys.

1498
01:38:38,871 --> 01:38:41,081
- I love all you guys.
- Great, Ray.

1499
01:38:41,082 --> 01:38:43,801
- And I love Venkman.
- Uh-huh. Let's go.

1500
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:46,294
- We gotta live with this?
- Real friendship.

1501
01:38:46,295 --> 01:38:48,255
Yeah.

1502
01:38:51,175 --> 01:38:54,599
Sir, are you all right?

1503
01:38:55,138 --> 01:38:57,472
Why am I drippings with goo?

1504
01:38:57,473 --> 01:39:00,934
You had a violent, prolonged,
transformative psychic episode.

1505
01:39:00,935 --> 01:39:04,484
Sorry we had to hose you there, but
you were kind of out of control.

1506
01:39:04,856 --> 01:39:07,023
Hey, man,

1507
01:39:07,024 --> 01:39:08,859
let me tell you something.

1508
01:39:08,860 --> 01:39:10,694
I love you.

1509
01:39:10,695 --> 01:39:12,320
- Yes?
- Yeah.

1510
01:39:12,321 --> 01:39:14,869
Well, I love you too.

1511
01:39:15,741 --> 01:39:17,993
Wow.

1512
01:39:17,994 --> 01:39:19,494
Hey, fellas.

1513
01:39:19,495 --> 01:39:21,963
You wanna take a look at this?

1514
01:39:26,252 --> 01:39:28,253
Wow.

1515
01:39:28,254 --> 01:39:30,130
Early Renaissance, I think.

1516
01:39:30,131 --> 01:39:33,925
Raphael or Piero della Francesca.

1517
01:39:33,926 --> 01:39:37,350
No, I believe it's one
of the Fettuccines.
