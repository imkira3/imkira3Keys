1
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,292
Starling!

2
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:51,795
Starling!

3
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,551
Crawford wants to see you in his office.

4
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,344
Thank you, sir.

5
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,810
-Clarice.
-Hey.

6
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,569
...so there shouldn't be any problem
if you could...

7
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,154
-You looking for Crawford?
-Yes, sir.

8
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:43,782
He should be back in a couple minutes.
Why don't you wait in his office?

9
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:46,868
-Okay.
-And I think they were over in Flushing...

10
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:42,799
Starling,

11
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,761
Clarice M. Good morning.

12
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,262
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.

13
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,682
Sorry to pull you off of the course
at such short notice.

14
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,726
Your instructors tell me you're doing well.

15
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,770
-Top quarter of your class.
-I hope so.

16
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:57,314
They haven't posted any grades yet.

17
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,150
A job's come up, and I thought about you.

18
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:03,111
Not a job, really.
More of an interesting errand.

19
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,446
Sit down.

20
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,114
Yes, sir.

21
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:10,118
I remember you from my seminar at UVA.

22
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:13,121
You grilled me pretty hard, as I recall,

23
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,707
on the Bureau's civil rights record
in the Hoover years.

24
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,125
I gave you an "A."

25
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,627
A-minus, sir.

26
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:24,549
Let's see. Double major,
psych and criminology. Graduated magna.

27
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:27,302
Summer internships
at the Reitzinger Clinic.

28
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,304
It says here when you graduate,

29
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:32,391
you want to come to work for me
in Behavioral Science.

30
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,643
Yes, very much, sir. Very much.

31
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,772
We're interviewing all the serial killers
now in custody

32
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,941
for a psycho-behavioral profile.

33
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:43,693
It could be a real help in unsolved cases.

34
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,655
Most of them have been
happy to talk to us.

35
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,907
Do you spook easily, Starling?

36
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,617
Not yet, sir.

37
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:53,787
See, the one we want most,
refuses to cooperate.

38
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,665
I want you to go after him again today
in the asylum.

39
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,333
And who's the subject?

40
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,710
The psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter.

41
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,838
Hannibal the Cannibal.

42
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,841
I don't expect him to talk to you,

43
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:10,011
but I have to be able to say we tried.

44
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:13,098
So if he won't cooperate,
I want just straight reporting.

45
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,183
How's he look? How's his cell look?

46
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,893
Is he sketching, drawing?

47
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,187
If he is, what's he sketching?

48
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,943
Here's a dossier on Lecter.

49
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,866
A copy of our questionnaire
and a special ID for you.

50
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,869
Have your memo on my desk
by 0800 Wednesday.

51
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,120
Okay.

52
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,709
Excuse me, sir, but why the urgency?

53
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,752
Lecter's been in prison
for so many years now.

54
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:46,047
Is there some connection
between him and Buffalo Bill maybe?

55
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,716
I wish there were.

56
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:51,845
-I want your full attention, Starling.
-Yes, sir.

57
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:54,639
Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter.

58
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,516
Dr. Chilton at the asylum

59
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,728
will go over all the physical procedures
used with him.

60
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:03,064
Do not deviate from them
for any reason whatsoever,

61
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,109
and you're to tell him
nothing personal, Starling.

62
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:09,779
Believe me, you don't want
Hannibal Lecter inside your head.

63
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,866
Just do your job,
but never forget what he is.

64
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,159
And what is that?

65
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,369
Oh, he's a monster.

66
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,371
A pure psychopath.

67
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,208
So rare to capture one alive.

68
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:25,212
From a research point of view,
Lecter is our most prized asset.

69
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,839
Well.

70
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,093
You know, we get a lot of detectives here,
but I must say,

71
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,804
I can't ever remember one as attractive.

72
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:39,476
Will you be in Baltimore overnight?

73
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:43,897
Because this can be quite a fun town
if you have the right guide.

74
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,651
Well, I'm sure
this is a great town, Dr. Chilton,

75
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:52,614
but my instructions are to talk to
Dr. Lecter and report back this afternoon.

76
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,115
I see.

77
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,451
Let's make this quick, then.

78
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,286
We've tried to study him, of course,

79
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,289
but he's much too sophisticated
for the standard tests.

80
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,708
Oh, my, does he hate us!

81
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,794
He thinks I'm his nemesis.

82
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:10,298
Crawford's very clever, isn't he?
Using you.

83
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,716
What do you mean, sir?

84
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,511
A pretty young woman to turn him on.

85
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,847
I don't believe Lecter's even seen a woman
in eight years.

86
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,183
And, oh, are you ever his taste.

87
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:21,810
So to speak.

88
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:25,063
I graduated from UVA, Doctor.
It is not a charm school.

89
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:28,358
Good. Then you should be able
to remember the rules.

90
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,655
Do not touch the glass.
Do not approach the glass.

91
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:37,075
You pass him nothing but soft paper.
No pencils or pens.

92
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,286
No staples or paper clips on his paper.

93
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,705
Use the sliding food carrier.
No exceptions.

94
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:44,165
If he attempts to pass you anything,
do not accept it.

95
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,168
-Do you understand me?
-Yes, I understand, sir.

96
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,423
I'm going to show you
why we insist on such precautions.

97
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:54,134
On the afternoon of July 8, 1981,

98
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:57,178
he complained of chest pains
and was taken to the dispensary.

99
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,931
His mouthpiece and restraints
were removed for an EKG.

100
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,851
When the nurse leaned over him,
he did this to her.

101
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,857
The doctors managed to reset her jaw,
more or less,

102
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,442
save one of her eyes.

103
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,736
His pulse never got above 85,

104
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,196
even when he ate her tongue.

105
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,866
I keep him in here.

106
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,492
Dr. Chilton.

107
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,372
If Lecter feels that you're his enemy,

108
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:28,168
then, well, maybe we'll have more luck
if I go in by myself.

109
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,919
What do you think?

110
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:36,635
You might have suggested this
in my office and saved me the time.

111
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:42,223
Yes, sir, but then I would have missed
the pleasure of your company, sir.

112
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,520
When she's finished, bring her out.

113
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,342
Hi. I'm Barney.

114
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:20,428
He told you, don't get near the glass?

115
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,931
Yes, he did. Clarice Starling.

116
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:24,974
Nice to meet you, Clarice.

117
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,560
You can hang your coat up here if you like.

118
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,270
Thank you. I will.

119
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:33,692
He's past the others. The last cell.

120
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,610
You keep to the right.

121
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,781
I put out a chair for you.

122
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,409
Oh, yes. That's very good. Thank you.

123
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:46,454
I'll be watching. You'll do fine.

124
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,383
Hi.

125
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,362
I can smell your cunt.

126
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,377
Good morning.

127
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:38,423
Dr. Lecter, my name is Clarice Starling.
May I speak with you?

128
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,509
You're one of Jack Crawford's, aren't you?

129
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,927
I am, yes, sir.

130
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,055
May I see your credentials?

131
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:47,766
Certainly.

132
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,357
Closer, please.

133
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,903
Closer.

134
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,712
That expires in one week.

135
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,507
You're not real FBI, are you?

136
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,301
I'm still in training at the Academy.

137
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,013
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?

138
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,390
Yes. I'm a student.

139
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,726
I'm here to learn from you.

140
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,144
Maybe you can decide for yourself

141
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:36,314
whether or not I'm qualified enough
to do that.

142
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:41,569
That is rather slippery of you,
Agent Starling.

143
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,783
Sit, please.

144
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,917
Now, then. Tell me,

145
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,253
what did Miggs say to you?

146
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,839
Multiple Miggs in the next cell.

147
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,799
He hissed at you.

148
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,467
What did he say?

149
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:08,596
He said, "I can smell your cunt."

150
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,139
I see.

151
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,434
I myself cannot.

152
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:25,113
You use Evyan skin cream.

153
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,618
And sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps,

154
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,538
but not today.

155
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,251
Did you do all these drawings, Doctor?

156
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:44,007
That is the Duomo,
seen from the Belvedere.

157
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,135
You know Florence?

158
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,471
All that detail just from memory, sir?

159
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:54,434
Memory, Agent Starling,
is what I have instead of a view.

160
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:55,643
Well,

161
00:14:55,728 --> 00:15:00,565
perhaps you'd care to lend us your view
on this questionnaire, sir.

162
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,984
Oh, no, no, no.

163
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,111
You were doing fine.

164
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,323
You had been courteous
and receptive to courtesy.

165
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:12,994
You had established trust
with the embarrassing truth about Miggs.

166
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:17,248
And now this ham-handed segue
into your questionnaire.

167
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,335
It won't do.

168
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,629
I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor.

169
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,797
Either you will or you won't.

170
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,924
Yeah.

171
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,676
Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed,

172
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,596
if he is recruiting help
from the student body.

173
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,515
Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill.

174
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,684
What a naughty boy he is.

175
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:40,605
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill?

176
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:43,858
Please tell me. The newspapers won't say.

177
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,779
Well, it started as a bad joke
in Kansas City Homicide.

178
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:51,616
They said,
"This one likes to skin his humps."

179
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:57,121
Why do you think he removes their skins,

180
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,706
Agent Starling?

181
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,959
Enthrall me with your acumen.

182
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,252
It excites him.

183
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:07,340
Most serial killers keep
some sort of trophies from their victims.

184
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,716
I didn't.

185
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:09,926
No.

186
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,678
No, you ate yours.

187
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,265
You send that through now.

188
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,335
Oh, Agent Starling,

189
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,922
you think you can dissect me
with this blunt, little tool?

190
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:49,507
No.

191
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,467
I thought that your knowledge...

192
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,803
You're so ambitious, aren't you?

193
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,430
You know what you look like to me

194
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,932
with your good bag and your cheap shoes?

195
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,767
You look like a rube.

196
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:04,230
A well-scrubbed, hustling rube
with a little taste.

197
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,442
Good nutrition has given you
some length of bone,

198
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:10,862
but you're not more than one generation
from poor white trash,

199
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,864
are you, Agent Starling?

200
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:15,783
And that accent you've tried
so desperately to shed,

201
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,535
pure West Virginia.

202
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,413
What does your father do?
Is he a coal miner?

203
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,498
Does he stink of the lamp?

204
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,209
And, oh, how quickly the boys found you.

205
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:28,838
All those tedious, sticky fumblings
in the back seats of cars,

206
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:32,675
while you could only dream
of getting out, getting anywhere,

207
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,471
getting all the way to the FBI.

208
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,642
You see a lot, Doctor.

209
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:47,523
But are you strong enough to point
that high-powered perception at yourself?

210
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,068
What about it? Why don't you...

211
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:53,738
Why don't you look at yourself
and write down what you see?

212
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,407
Maybe you're afraid to.

213
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,795
A census-taker once tried to test me.

214
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:12,548
I ate his liver with some fava beans,

215
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,675
and a nice Chianti.

216
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,395
You fly back to school now, little Starling.

217
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,564
Fly, fly, fly.

218
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:47,375
I bit my wrist so I could die.

219
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,711
Look at the blood!

220
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,421
Gotcha!

221
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:55,550
Miggs! You stupid fuck!

222
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,512
Hannibal the Cannibal!

223
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,180
Agent Starling! Come back!

224
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,474
Agent Starling! Agent Starling!

225
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,143
I would not have had that happen to you.

226
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,019
Discourtesy is unspeakably ugly to me.

227
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:09,730
-Then do this test for me.
-No, but I will make you happy.

228
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,607
I'll give you a chance
for what you love most.

229
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,651
-And what is that, Doctor?
-Advancement, of course.

230
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:17,363
Now listen carefully. Look deep
within yourself, Clarice Starling.

231
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:21,284
Go seek out Miss Mofet,
an old patient of mine. M-o-f-e-t. Go now.

232
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:22,410
Doctor.

233
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:23,870
I don't think Miggs could manage again
quite so soon,

234
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,163
even though he is crazy.

235
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,581
Go now!

236
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,624
Hey, Bill.

237
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,295
Hey.

238
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,505
-Daddy!
-Hey, Clarice.

239
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,383
How are you?

240
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,345
Did you get any bad guys today, Daddy?

241
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:25,431
-No, angel, they all got away.
-Aw, shoot.

242
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,287
FBI! Hands up! Don't move!

243
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,497
Turn around!

244
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,916
Hands behind your back! Thumbs up.

245
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,505
You're dead, Starling.

246
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,050
Johnson, good job.
Good entry. Good commands.

247
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,177
-Starling, where's your danger area?
-In the corner, sir.

248
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,637
-Did you check the corner?
-No, sir.

249
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,846
That's the reason you're dead.

250
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:07,723
3109.

251
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,225
3109.

252
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:13,521
Breaking doors or windows
to enter or exit.

253
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,023
Rule 404...

254
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:37,795
-Clarice, phone. It's the guru.
-Crawford?

255
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,171
-Yeah.
-Thanks, Ardelia.

256
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,132
-Starling?
-Sir?

257
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,592
Miggs is dead.

258
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,346
Dead? How?

259
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,809
The orderly heard Lecter whispering
to him all afternoon, and Miggs crying.

260
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:55,563
They found him at bed check.
He'd swallowed his own tongue.

261
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,733
Starling?

262
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,068
Yeah, I'm still here, sir.

263
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,113
I just... I don't know
how to feel about this.

264
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:08,909
You don't have to feel any way about it.
Lecter did it to amuse himself.

265
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:11,662
Look, I know it got ugly today,

266
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:15,082
but you mentioned a name
at the end. Mofet.

267
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,043
Any follow-up on her?

268
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:20,588
Well, Lecter altered or destroyed
most of his patients' histories

269
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,257
prior to capture, so there's no record
of anyone named Mofet.

270
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:27,553
But I thought the "yourself" reference

271
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,221
was too hokey for Lecter,

272
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:33,601
so I figured, he's from Baltimore,
and I looked in the phone book,

273
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:37,146
and there's a "Your Self Storage" facility,

274
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,482
right outside of downtown Baltimore, sir.

275
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:45,571
Unit 31 was leased for 10 years,

276
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,365
prepaid in full.

277
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:48,866
The contract

278
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:52,953
is in the name of a Miss Hester Mofet.

279
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,332
So nobody's been in here since 1980?

280
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,376
Not to my knowledge.

281
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:02,922
Privacy is a great concern
to my customers.

282
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,716
Yes, I won't disturb anything. I promise.

283
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,260
I'll be out of here before you know it.

284
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:11,931
-Can I help you?
-Yes, actually, you can.

285
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,312
It's stuck.

286
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:21,107
We could return tomorrow with my son.

287
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,817
What about him?

288
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:28,948
I would ask my driver to help you,
but he detests physical labor.

289
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:30,991
Great.

290
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:34,620
You just stay here.
I'll be back in one minute.

291
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,154
It's stuck.

292
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,322
Hand me that flashlight, sir.

293
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,042
Oh.

294
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:28,215
If this door should fall down
or anything else,

295
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,678
this is the number
for our Baltimore field office.

296
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,555
Now, they know that you're with me.

297
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,724
You call them if anything should happen.

298
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:38,392
Yes, Miss Starling.

299
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:10,878
Clarice...

300
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:14,089
-They're waiting for you. Watch yourself.
-Thank you.

301
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:18,302
Hester Mofet.
It's an anagram, isn't it, Doctor?

302
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,556
Hester Mofet, "The rest of me."

303
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:26,268
"Miss The Rest Of Me,"
meaning that you rented that garage?

304
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,722
Thank you.

305
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:06,308
Your bleeding has stopped.

306
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:09,937
How did you...

307
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,065
It's nothing.

308
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,150
It's just a scratch.

309
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:18,862
Dr. Lecter, whose head is in that bottle?

310
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:22,116
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?

311
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:24,201
Why, do you know something about him?

312
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,412
I might, if I saw the case file.

313
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:28,414
You could get that for me.

314
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:30,124
Why don't we talk about Miss Mofet?

315
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,167
You wanted me to find him.

316
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:35,796
His real name is Benjamin Raspail.

317
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:38,090
A former patient of mine,

318
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:42,636
whose romantic attachments ran to,
shall we say, the exotic.

319
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,805
I did not kill him, I assure you.

320
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,599
Merely tucked him away
very much as I found him,

321
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:50,185
after he'd missed three appointments.

322
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,689
If you didn't kill him, then who did, sir?

323
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,065
Who can say?

324
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,817
Best thing for him, really.

325
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,111
His therapy was going nowhere.

326
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:02,656
His dress, makeup...

327
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:05,117
Raspail was a transvestite?

328
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,578
In life? Oh, no.

329
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:09,997
Garden variety manic-depressive.

330
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:12,124
Tedious. Very tedious.

331
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:15,252
And I just think of him
as a kind of experiment,

332
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:18,714
a fledgling killer's first effort
at transformation.

333
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:21,675
How did you feel
when you saw him, Clarice?

334
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,178
Scared at first, then,

335
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,513
exhilarated.

336
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,475
Jack Crawford is helping your career,
isn't he?

337
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:32,603
Apparently, he likes you,
and you like him, too.

338
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,897
I never thought about it.

339
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,150
Do you think Jack Crawford
wants you sexually?

340
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,777
True, he is much older,

341
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:43,489
but do you think he visualizes
scenarios, exchanges,

342
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:44,907
fucking you?

343
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,203
That doesn't interest me, Doctor.

344
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:52,831
Frankly, it's the sort of thing
that Miggs would say.

345
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,210
Not anymore.

346
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,552
Thank you, Barney.

347
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:11,809
What happened to your drawings?

348
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:15,437
Punishment, you see, for Miggs.

349
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,773
Just like that gospel program.

350
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:20,901
When you leave,
they'll turn the volume way up.

351
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:24,029
Dr. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.

352
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:27,699
What did you mean
by transformation, Doctor?

353
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:39,586
I've been in this room
for eight years now, Clarice.

354
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:43,465
I know they will never,
ever let me out while I'm alive.

355
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,093
What I want is a view.

356
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:50,430
I want a window where I can see a tree,
or even water.

357
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:54,101
I want to be in a federal institution
far away from Dr. Chilton.

358
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,728
What did you mean by fledgling killer?

359
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,106
Are you saying that he's killed again?

360
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:02,442
I'm offering you a psychological profile
on Buffalo Bill,

361
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,570
based on the case evidence.

362
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,411
I'll help you catch him, Clarice.

363
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:21,295
You know who he is, don't you?

364
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,965
Tell me who decapitated
your patient, Doctor.

365
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,759
All good things to those who wait.

366
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,595
I've waited, Clarice,

367
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:32,514
but how long can you
and old Jackie boy wait?

368
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,975
Our little Billy must already be searching

369
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:38,103
for that next special lady.

370
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,126
Hey, little cheeper.

371
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,553
I'll be right there.

372
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:55,514
Oh, shoot.

373
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:03,814
Goddamn it.

374
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,449
Perfect! Jesus.

375
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:22,040
Can I help you with that?

376
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:25,168
-Would you?
-Sure.

377
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,921
-Thank you.
-That's all right.

378
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,382
-You look kind of handicapped.
-Yeah.

379
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:33,719
I got it this far.
I just can't get it up in the truck.

380
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,303
Here. Just grab this.

381
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:36,888
Okay.

382
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:39,099
Good. Just set it down. That's good.

383
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:43,103
Get in the truck.
I want to push it all the way up.

384
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,856
-I really appreciate this. Thank you.
-All right.

385
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,524
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

386
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:50,110
Just go all the way back.

387
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,779
Okay. Is this good?

388
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,364
Yeah, that's good.

389
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,410
-That's great.
-Okay.

390
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:01,246
Say, are you about a size 14?

391
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:02,581
Sorry?

392
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:24,978
Good.

393
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:47,125
Oh, good. Good.

394
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,226
Hold!

395
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,031
Starling!

396
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:22,452
Outside. Let's go.

397
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:26,540
Cindy, in the ring for Starling. Let's go!

398
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,800
FBI! Hold it! Hold it right there!

399
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:38,593
Saddle up. Pack your field gear.
You're moving out.

400
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,095
-You're going with Crawford.
-Where?

401
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,888
Found a girl's body down in West Virginia.

402
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,891
Been in the water about a week.
Looks like a Buffalo Bill-type situation.

403
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,948
He keeps them alive for three days.
We don't know why.

404
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:03,201
There's no evidence
of rape or physical abuse prior to death.

405
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:06,288
All the mutilation you see there
is postmortem.

406
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,331
Okay, three days.

407
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:12,085
Then he shoots them, skins them,
and dumps them.

408
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:14,171
Each body in a different river.

409
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:17,424
The water leaves us no trace evidence
of any kind.

410
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:20,135
That's Fredrica Bimmel, the first one.

411
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:23,221
Her body was the only one
he took the trouble to weight down,

412
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:26,016
so actually, she was the third girl found.

413
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,101
After her, he got lazy.

414
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:32,939
Okay. Let's see.

415
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,609
Circles where the girls were abducted,

416
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:37,944
arrows where their bodies were found.

417
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:41,198
This new one today washed up here.

418
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:42,741
Elk River, West Virginia.

419
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:05,305
Look at him, Starling.
Tell me what you see.

420
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,807
Well, he's a white male.

421
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:11,561
Serial killers tend to hunt
within their own ethnic groups.

422
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:12,687
He's not a drifter.

423
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:16,316
He's got his own house somewhere,
not an apartment.

424
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,653
-Why?
-What he does with them takes privacy.

425
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:22,197
He's in his 30s or 40s.

426
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:24,574
He's got real physical strength,

427
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:27,661
combined with an older man's self-control.

428
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,996
He's cautious, precise.

429
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:33,667
And he's never impulsive. He'll never stop.

430
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,293
Why not?

431
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:40,507
He's got a real taste for it now.
He's getting better at his work.

432
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,843
Not bad, Starling.

433
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,221
-Questions?
-Yes, sir.

434
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:50,684
You haven't mentioned anything about
the information contained in my report

435
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:52,852
or Dr. Lecter's offer, sir.

436
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,688
I'm considering it.

437
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:57,732
That's why you sent me in there, isn't it?

438
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,985
To get his help on Buffalo Bill, sir?

439
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,865
Well, if that was the case, then I just...

440
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,660
I just wish I was in on it. That's all.

441
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:11,204
If I had sent you in there
with an actual agenda,

442
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,164
Lecter would have known it instantly.

443
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:16,543
He would have toyed with you,
then turned to stone.

444
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:53,580
Excuse me.
Sheriff Perkins, these are the FBI people.

445
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:56,333
Sheriff Perkins. Jack Crawford, FBI.

446
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,252
Special Agent Terry, Agent Starling.

447
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:01,921
We appreciate being invited
to your jurisdiction.

448
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:05,300
I didn't call you. That was somebody
from the State Attorney's office.

449
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:07,552
We'll extend you every courtesy,
but right now...

450
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:12,057
Sheriff, this type of sex crime
has certain aspects.

451
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:14,434
I'd just as soon discuss in private.

452
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,311
You know what I mean?

453
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:09,591
-Oscar, fetch Dr. Akin from the chapel.
-Yes, sir.

454
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:10,884
Starling, we're back here.

455
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:14,095
Tell Lamar to come on
when he's finished playing his music.

456
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:14,387
Yeah. We'll be sending in a minute.

457
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:16,806
Yeah. We'll be sending in a minute.

458
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:18,766
Is this working?

459
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:21,561
I need a six-way linkup.

460
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,313
Chicago, Detroit...

461
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,772
What? What?

462
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:32,697
Excuse me! Excuse me, gentlemen.

463
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,033
You officers and gentlemen,
listen here now.

464
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,701
There's things we need to do for her.

465
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,620
I know that you all brought her this far

466
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:41,372
and that her folks would
thank you if they could

467
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:43,750
for your kindness and your sensitivity.

468
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:47,253
And now, please,
go on now and let us take care of her.

469
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:49,339
Go on, now.

470
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:53,760
Thank you.

471
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:58,848
Thank you.

472
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,018
Okay, good.

473
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:12,987
Yeah, that's right. West Virginia. Elk River.

474
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:15,114
Stand by for transmission.

475
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,078
Ray.

476
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:35,260
Doctor, Lamar, let's take a look at her.

477
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:53,111
Oh, Jesus.

478
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:02,453
Okay, Starling.

479
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:08,626
Bill.

480
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:29,147
Star-shaped contact entrance wound
over the sternum.

481
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:33,484
Muzzle stamp at the top.

482
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:35,987
-Wrongful death.
-"Wrongful death."

483
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:40,199
She'll have to go
to the state pathologist at Claxton.

484
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:42,577
Well, I better get back to that service.

485
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:44,412
Lamar will help you.

486
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,247
Lord Almighty.

487
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,046
What else do you see, Starling?

488
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:56,299
Well, she's not local.

489
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:00,720
Her ears are pierced three times,
and there's...

490
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:05,058
Glitter nail polish. It looks like town to me.

491
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,440
Two of her fingernails are broken off,

492
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:16,069
and there's dirt or grit under them.

493
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:20,323
It looks like she's tried to claw her way
through something.

494
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:23,242
Ray, get pictures of her teeth.
We'll fax them through Missing Persons.

495
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:24,452
Right.

496
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:35,922
Let's do another.

497
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,141
She's got something in her throat.

498
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,602
When a body comes out of the water,

499
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:52,772
lots of times there's, like,
leaves and things in the mouth.

500
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:26,806
What is that, some kind of seedpod?

501
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,017
No, sir. That's a bug cocoon.

502
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:33,521
There's no way that could get
way down in there like that.

503
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:36,315
Not unless somebody shoved it in there.

504
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:41,154
She'll be easier to print
when we turn her over.

505
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:44,532
-Lamar, will you give me a hand with this?
-Yes, sir, I will.

506
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:51,873
Oh, Jack. What do you make of these?

507
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:54,417
Different configuration
than the other victims.

508
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:55,793
Get close-ups.

509
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:59,505
Victim's skin removed this time
in two large diamond-shaped sections

510
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:00,798
above the buttocks.

511
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:04,260
Stellate exit wound level with the second
or the third thoracic vertebrae

512
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:07,054
approximately six inches
from the right shoulder blade.

513
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:08,431
Starling?

514
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:13,436
When I told that sheriff
we shouldn't talk in front of a woman,

515
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,354
that really burned you, didn't it?

516
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:18,858
It was just smoke, Starling.
I had to get rid of him.

517
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,860
It matters, Mr. Crawford.

518
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:23,446
Cops look at you to see how to act.

519
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:25,740
-It matters.
-Point taken.

520
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:34,707
Ligature marks found around the wrists,

521
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,542
not around the ankles.

522
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:39,962
This would indicate
that the skinning was postmortem.

523
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,405
-Time, Pilch. My move.
-No fair. You lured him with produce.

524
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:08,699
Tough noogies. Still my turn.

525
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,744
Nice and slow, baby.

526
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:16,249
If the beetle moves one of your men,
does that still count?

527
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:19,252
Of course it counts. How do you play?

528
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:22,129
Agent Starling?

529
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:27,426
Where the heck did this come from?
It's practically mush.

530
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,762
It was found behind the soft palate
of a murder victim.

531
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:32,098
The body was in the Elk River,
West Virginia.

532
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:33,558
It's Buffalo Bill, isn't it?

533
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,393
I'm afraid I can't tell you
any more about that.

534
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,727
We heard about it on the radio.

535
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:40,106
You mean this is like a clue
from a real murder case? Cool!

536
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:42,608
Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D.

537
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:46,112
A Sphingid. Ceratomia, maybe.

538
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:48,072
Boy, he's a big sucker.

539
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:50,783
Okay.

540
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:52,827
Let's check morphology.

541
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,338
What do you do when
you're not detecting, Agent Starling?

542
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:08,426
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.

543
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:11,304
You ever go out
for cheeseburgers and beer?

544
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:14,348
The amusing house wine?

545
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:18,019
-Are you hitting on me, Doctor?
-Yes.

546
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:20,479
-Got you.
-What do you got, Roden?

547
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:24,817
Agent Starling, meet Mr. Acherontia styx.

548
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:26,903
Weird.

549
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:30,323
Better known to his friends
as the Death's Head Moth.

550
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:33,117
-And where does it come from?
-That's what's strange.

551
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,869
-They only live in Asia.
-Asia?

552
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:37,830
In this country, they'd have to be
specially raised from imported eggs.

553
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:41,459
Somebody grew this guy,
fed him honey and nightshade,

554
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:43,044
kept him warm.

555
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:45,546
Somebody loved him.

556
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,290
Where are you?

557
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:24,585
Let me out of here!

558
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,721
Please don't leave!

559
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,393
Talk to me, please!

560
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:43,896
Why won't you answer me? Please!

561
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:48,442
Good morning. I'm Donna Ferucchi.

562
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:50,069
I'm Gene Cassel with sports.

563
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:53,406
And I'm Tim Langhorn.
Our top story for this morning.

564
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:54,824
Catherine Martin,

565
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:57,576
the 25-year-old daughter
of Senator Ruth Martin,

566
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:01,122
listed first as a missing person,
is now believed to have been kidnapped

567
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:03,958
by the serial killer
known only as Buffalo Bill.

568
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:06,627
Memphis police sources indicate
that the missing girl's blouse

569
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:08,713
has been identified, sliced up the back

570
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:12,425
in what has become a kind of grim,
all-too-familiar calling card.

571
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:14,093
Young Catherine Martin, as we've said,

572
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:16,429
is the only daughter of
U.S. Senator Ruth Martin,

573
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:18,764
the Republican junior senator
from Tennessee.

574
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,725
And while her kidnapping is not,
at this point,

575
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:22,435
considered to be politically motivated,

576
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:25,604
nevertheless, it has stirred
the government to its highest levels.

577
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:28,607
Reached for a comment
on the ski slopes of Stowe, Vermont,

578
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:32,653
the president himself said to be,
and I quote, "Intensely concerned."

579
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:34,238
Just moments ago, Senator Martin

580
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:37,283
-taped this dramatic personal plea.
-Excuse me.

581
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:40,995
I'm speaking now
to the person who is holding my daughter.

582
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:45,082
Catherine is very gentle and kind.

583
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,461
Talk to her, and you'll see.

584
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:53,090
You have the power. You are in charge.

585
00:50:56,344 --> 00:50:59,472
I know you can feel love and compassion.

586
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:04,477
You have a wonderful chance
to show the whole world

587
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:08,022
that you can be merciful as well as strong,

588
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:13,527
that you're big enough to treat Catherine
better than the world has treated you.

589
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,821
You have that power.

590
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:17,573
Please.

591
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:20,576
My daughter is Catherine.

592
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,745
-Boy, that's smart.
-Release her unharmed.

593
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:24,288
Jesus, that's really smart.

594
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:26,582
She keeps repeating the name.

595
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:30,086
If he sees Catherine as a person
and not just an object,

596
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:34,548
-it's harder to tear her up.
-Please. Release my little girl.

597
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,134
What you're doing, Miss Starling,

598
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:39,386
is coming into my hospital
to conduct an interview

599
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:43,349
and refusing to share information with me
for the third time.

600
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:45,684
Sir, I told you,

601
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:47,895
this is just a routine follow-up
on the Raspail case.

602
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:51,315
-He is my patient. I have rights.
-I understand that, sir.

603
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:55,528
Look, I am not just some turnkey,
Miss Starling.

604
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:59,323
This is the number for
the U.S. Attorney's office.

605
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:01,659
Please, either you discuss this with him,

606
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:04,453
or you let me do my job.
Do you understand?

607
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:12,002
If your profile helps us catch Buffalo Bill

608
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:14,964
in time to save Catherine Martin,

609
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:18,300
the senator promises you a transfer

610
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:21,303
to the V.A. Hospital
at Oneida Park, New York,

611
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:22,721
with a view of the woods nearby.

612
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:25,558
Maximum security still applies, of course.

613
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:28,394
You'd have reasonable access to books.

614
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:31,021
Best of all, though.

615
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:33,149
One week of the year,

616
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:37,278
you get to leave the hospital and go here.

617
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:42,241
Plum Island.

618
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:46,829
Every day of that week
you may walk on the beach,

619
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:49,498
you may swim in the ocean
for up to one hour,

620
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:52,835
under SWAT team surveillance, of course.

621
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,462
And there you have it.

622
00:52:58,091 --> 00:53:01,760
A copy of the Buffalo Bill case file.

623
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:05,598
A copy of the senator's offer.

624
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:09,185
This offer is non-negotiable and final.

625
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:12,771
If Catherine Martin dies, you get nothing.

626
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:25,951
"Plum Island
Animal Disease Research Center."

627
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:30,748
Sounds charming.

628
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:35,294
That's only part of the island.
There's a very, very nice beach.

629
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:38,547
-Terns nest there. There's beautiful...
-Terns?

630
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:44,094
If I help you, Clarice,
it will be "turns" with us, too.

631
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:47,306
Quid pro quo.
I tell you things, you tell me things.

632
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:50,309
Not about this case, though.
About yourself.

633
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:53,020
Quid pro quo. Yes or no?

634
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:59,151
Yes or no, Clarice?
Poor little Catherine is waiting.

635
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:01,987
Go, Doctor.

636
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:05,783
What is your worst memory of childhood?

637
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:09,578
The death of my father.

638
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:13,332
Tell me about it. And don't lie, or I'll know.

639
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:16,335
He was a town marshal,

640
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:21,131
and one night he surprised two burglars

641
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:23,842
coming out of the back of a drugstore.

642
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:26,345
They shot him.

643
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:28,806
Was he killed outright?

644
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:33,185
No. He was very strong.
He lasted more than a month.

645
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:37,147
My mother died when I was very young,

646
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:41,193
so my father had become
the whole world to me,

647
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:44,863
and when he left me, I had nothing.
I was ten years old.

648
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,701
You're very frank, Clarice.

649
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:53,539
I think it would be quite something
to know you in private life.

650
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:58,043
Quid pro quo, Doctor.

651
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:01,338
So tell me about Miss West Virginia.

652
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:03,382
Was she a large girl?

653
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:07,344
Yes.

654
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:11,098
-Big through the hips? Roomy?
-They all were.

655
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:13,267
What else?

656
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:17,146
She had an object
deliberately inserted into her throat.

657
00:55:17,355 --> 00:55:20,065
Now, that hasn't been made public yet.

658
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,067
We don't know what it means.

659
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,902
Was it a butterfly?

660
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:27,239
Yes. A moth.

661
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:32,536
Just like the one we found
in Benjamin Raspail's head an hour ago.

662
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:36,665
Why does he place them there, Doctor?

663
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:40,294
The significance of the moth is change.

664
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:43,964
Caterpillar into chrysalis or pupa,

665
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,925
and from thence into beauty.

666
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:50,137
Our Billy wants to change, too.

667
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:54,808
There's no correlation in literature
between transsexualism and violence.

668
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:57,978
-Transsexuals are very passive...
-Clever girl.

669
00:55:58,229 --> 00:56:00,105
You're so close
to the way you're gonna catch him.

670
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:03,067
-Do you realize that?
-No. Tell me why.

671
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:06,737
After your father's murder,
you were orphaned.

672
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,572
What happened next?

673
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:16,163
I don't imagine the answer
is on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.

674
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:20,626
I went to live with my mother's cousin
and her husband in Montana.

675
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,378
They had a ranch.

676
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:25,506
-Was it a cattle ranch?
-Sheep and horses.

677
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:29,927
-How long did you live there?
-Two months.

678
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:33,180
-Why so briefly?
-I ran away.

679
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:35,307
Why, Clarice?

680
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:37,893
Did the rancher make you perform fellatio?

681
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:39,978
Did he sodomize you?

682
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,399
No. He was a very decent man.

683
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:47,236
Quid pro quo, Doctor.

684
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,615
Billy is not a real transsexual.

685
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,992
But he thinks he is. He tries to be.

686
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:56,954
He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.

687
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:59,790
And you said that I was very close
to the way we would catch him.

688
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,250
What did you mean, Doctor?

689
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:03,877
There are three major centers
for transsexual surgery.

690
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:08,173
Johns Hopkins, the University of
Minnesota, and Columbus Medical Center.

691
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:11,718
I wouldn't be surprised
if Billy had applied for sex reassignment

692
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:14,721
at one or all of them and been rejected.

693
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:17,766
On what basis would they reject him?

694
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:22,938
Look for severe childhood disturbances
associated with violence.

695
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:26,233
Our Billy wasn't born a criminal, Clarice.

696
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:30,070
He was made one
through years of systematic abuse.

697
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:34,366
Billy hates his own identity, you see,

698
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:37,202
and he thinks that makes him
a transsexual.

699
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:41,290
But his pathology
is a thousand times more savage

700
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:43,167
and more terrifying.

701
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:50,883
It rubs the lotion on its skin.
It does this whenever it's told.

702
00:57:51,676 --> 00:57:53,552
Mister, my family will pay cash.

703
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:56,889
Whatever ransom you're asking for,
they'll pay it.

704
00:57:57,432 --> 00:58:01,894
It rubs the lotion on its skin,
or else it gets the hose again.

705
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:06,899
Yes, she will, Precious.
She will get the hose.

706
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:09,818
Okay, okay, okay.

707
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:13,238
Okay. I'm there.

708
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:14,781
Okay.

709
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:19,953
Mister, if you let me go,
I won't press charges.

710
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:21,413
I promise.

711
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:27,002
See, my mom is a real important woman.
I guess you already know that.

712
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:30,047
Now it places the lotion in the basket.

713
00:58:30,715 --> 00:58:34,593
Please! Please! I want to go home.

714
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:38,931
I want to go home, please!
Please, I want to...

715
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:41,517
It places the lotion in the basket.

716
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:46,146
I want to see my mommy! Please.

717
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:49,816
I want to see my mother again.

718
00:58:50,401 --> 00:58:53,111
I want to see my mommy.

719
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:56,823
Put the fucking lotion in the basket!

720
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:35,946
You still think you're gonna
walk on some beach and see the birdies?

721
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:37,906
No, I don't think so.

722
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:42,160
I called Senator Ruth Martin.

723
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:44,871
She never heard of any deal with you.

724
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,666
They scammed you, Hannibal.

725
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:51,253
Stand outside

726
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:54,256
and shut the door.

727
00:59:54,507 --> 00:59:55,716
Barney.

728
01:00:01,889 --> 01:00:06,018
There never was a deal
with Senator Martin, but there is now.

729
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:07,811
I designed it.

730
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:11,481
Of course, I worked in a few conditions
for my own benefit as well.

731
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:14,860
Identify Buffalo Bill by name

732
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:17,195
and if the girl is found in time,

733
01:00:17,238 --> 01:00:18,989
Senator Martin will have you
transferred to

734
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:21,199
Brushy Mountain State Prison
in Tennessee.

735
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,453
Answer me, Hannibal.

736
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:30,626
You answer me now,
or by God, you'll never leave this cell.

737
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:34,880
Who is Buffalo Bill?

738
01:00:36,215 --> 01:00:38,216
His first name is Louis.

739
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:42,387
I'll tell the rest to the Senator herself,
but only in Tennessee,

740
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:45,098
and I have a few conditions of my own.

741
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:50,020
Clean him up and get him ready to go.

742
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:54,024
Jack, Hannibal Lecter
is being transferred to Memphis.

743
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:55,692
Transferred?

744
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:58,862
Did you have a trainee
make some sort of phony offer to Lecter

745
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:00,238
in the Senator's name?

746
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:02,366
Yeah. I rolled the dice. I had to.

747
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:04,743
Well, she's mad as hell, Jack.

748
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:06,828
Paul Krendler's over here from Justice.

749
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:09,581
She's asking him to take over in Memphis.

750
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:36,149
Welcome to Memphis, Dr. Lecter.

751
01:01:36,234 --> 01:01:39,027
I'm Lieutenant Boyle.
This is Sergeant Patrick.

752
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:41,279
Now, we're gonna treat you
as good as you treat us.

753
01:01:41,322 --> 01:01:44,825
You be a gentleman,
you gonna get three hots and a cot.

754
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:49,079
Sir. If you sign right here,
we'll have us a legal transfer.

755
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,583
Where is it?

756
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:56,628
Here, sir. Use mine.

757
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:47,512
Senator Martin, Dr. Hannibal Lecter.

758
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:54,227
Dr. Lecter,

759
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:58,231
I brought an affidavit
guaranteeing your new rights.

760
01:02:58,566 --> 01:03:01,193
You'll want to read it before I sign.

761
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:09,201
I won't waste your time or Catherine's
time bargaining for petty privileges.

762
01:03:09,243 --> 01:03:11,369
Clarice Starling
and that awful Jack Crawford

763
01:03:11,412 --> 01:03:13,538
have wasted far too much time already.

764
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:16,666
I only pray they haven't doomed
the poor girl.

765
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:21,379
Let me help you now
and I will trust you when it is all over.

766
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:23,381
You have my word. Paul?

767
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:28,720
Buffalo Bill's real name is Louis Friend.

768
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:31,056
I met him just once.

769
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:34,226
He was referred to me in April
or May, 1980,

770
01:03:34,268 --> 01:03:36,603
by my patient Benjamin Raspail.

771
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:39,231
They were lovers, you see.

772
01:03:39,398 --> 01:03:42,818
But Raspail had become very frightened.

773
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:46,822
Apparently, Louis had murdered
a transient

774
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:50,367
and done things with her skin.

775
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:54,496
We need his address
and a physical description.

776
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:57,165
Tell me, Senator.

777
01:03:57,792 --> 01:04:00,252
Did you nurse Catherine yourself?

778
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:03,004
-What?
-Did you breast-feed her?

779
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:05,715
-Now, wait a minute!
-Yes, I did.

780
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:09,761
-Toughened your nipples, didn't it?
-You son of a bitch!

781
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:13,598
Amputate a man's leg,
and he can still feel it tickling.

782
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:17,477
Tell me, Mom,
when your little girl is on the slab,

783
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:19,563
where will it tickle you?

784
01:04:19,605 --> 01:04:22,607
Take this thing back to Baltimore.

785
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:27,237
Five-foot-ten, strongly built,
about 180 pounds.

786
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:29,614
Hair, blond. Eyes, pale blue.

787
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:31,408
He'd be about 35 now.

788
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:34,536
He said he lived in Philadelphia,
but may have lied.

789
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:36,621
That's all I can remember, Mom.

790
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:39,791
But if I think of any more,
I will let you know.

791
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:44,296
Oh, and, Senator, just one more thing.

792
01:04:46,632 --> 01:04:48,174
Love your suit.

793
01:04:50,428 --> 01:04:52,637
I tell you now
that in a meeting earlier this evening

794
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:53,972
with Senator Ruth Martin,

795
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:57,058
Dr. Lecter agreed
to assist in the investigation

796
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:59,978
of trying to find the abductor
of Catherine Martin, Buffalo Bill.

797
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:01,062
How do you fit in, sir?

798
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:02,647
Well, it's only through
my own unique insight

799
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:04,774
into Lecter's mind
that this breakthrough was possible.

800
01:05:04,817 --> 01:05:05,942
And Buffalo Bill's real name...

801
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:09,905
Buffalo Bill's real name is now a matter
of record with the proper authorities.

802
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:12,574
-Can you give us any more information?
-My name is Dr. Frederick Chilton.

803
01:05:12,658 --> 01:05:14,159
-How do you spell that?
-C-H...

804
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:20,332
-Are you with Dr. Chilton's group?
-Oh, well, I just saw him outside, sir.

805
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:24,127
Access to Lecter is strictly limited.
We've been getting death threats.

806
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:25,879
I understand, sir.

807
01:05:31,969 --> 01:05:34,012
Log in. Check your weapon.

808
01:05:34,847 --> 01:05:37,265
Well, I can't take all the credit for myself.

809
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:39,893
Senator Martin, the Justice Department,
the people at the FBI,

810
01:05:39,977 --> 01:05:42,187
the folks at the Baltimore State Hospital.

811
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:45,565
And now for the hard part,
apprehending the suspect.

812
01:05:45,816 --> 01:05:48,276
Excuse me, folks,
I'm gonna have to catch a flight.

813
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:54,407
Command desk. Officer Jacobs.

814
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:05,168
Is it true what they're saying?

815
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:09,297
He's some kind of vampire?

816
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:14,302
They don't have a name for what he is.

817
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:16,846
You do know the rules, ma'am?

818
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:19,933
Yes, Lieutenant Boyle.
I've questioned him before.

819
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:24,562
Go ahead.

820
01:07:01,475 --> 01:07:03,393
Good evening, Clarice.

821
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:08,398
I thought you might like
your drawings back, Doctor.

822
01:07:10,484 --> 01:07:12,736
Just until you get your view.

823
01:07:13,237 --> 01:07:15,030
How very thoughtful.

824
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:19,534
Or did Jack Crawford send you
for one last wheedle

825
01:07:19,618 --> 01:07:21,828
before you're both booted off the case?

826
01:07:22,246 --> 01:07:24,581
No. I came because I wanted to.

827
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:31,421
People will say we're in love.

828
01:07:35,676 --> 01:07:37,761
Anthrax Island.

829
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:41,347
That was an especially nice touch, Clarice.

830
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:43,850
-Yours?
-Yes.

831
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:47,896
Yeah! That was good.

832
01:07:48,814 --> 01:07:50,815
Pity about poor Catherine, though.

833
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,820
Your anagrams are showing, Doctor.

834
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:58,239
Louis Friend?

835
01:07:58,991 --> 01:08:01,951
Iron sulfide, also known as Fool's Gold.

836
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:06,664
Oh, Clarice. Your problem is
you need to get more fun out of life.

837
01:08:06,957 --> 01:08:09,918
You were telling me the truth
back in Baltimore, sir.

838
01:08:10,002 --> 01:08:11,795
Please continue now.

839
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:15,006
Well, I have read the case files, have you?

840
01:08:15,049 --> 01:08:18,218
Everything you need to find him
is right there in those pages.

841
01:08:18,302 --> 01:08:22,722
-Then tell me how.
-First principles, Clarice. Simplicity.

842
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:24,766
Read Marcus Aurelius.

843
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:28,144
Of each particular thing,
ask what is it in itself?

844
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:30,146
What is its nature?

845
01:08:30,564 --> 01:08:33,858
What does he do, this man you seek?

846
01:08:36,028 --> 01:08:37,570
He kills women.

847
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:40,198
No! That is incidental.

848
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:43,201
What is the first
and principal thing he does?

849
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:46,538
What needs does he serve by killing?

850
01:08:47,039 --> 01:08:48,248
Anger.

851
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:54,337
Social acceptance
and sexual frustrations...

852
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:57,340
No! He covets.

853
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:00,385
That is his nature.

854
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:03,388
And how do we begin to covet, Clarice?

855
01:09:03,889 --> 01:09:06,224
Do we seek out things to covet?

856
01:09:07,059 --> 01:09:09,102
Make an effort to answer now.

857
01:09:09,186 --> 01:09:11,437
No. We just...

858
01:09:11,897 --> 01:09:14,983
No. We begin by coveting
what we see every day.

859
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:18,611
Don't you feel eyes
moving over your body, Clarice?

860
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:22,699
And don't your eyes
seek out the things you want?

861
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:25,869
All right. Yes. Now please tell me how.

862
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:30,081
No. It is your turn to tell me, Clarice.

863
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:33,209
You don't have any more vacations to sell.

864
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:35,795
Why did you leave that ranch?

865
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:40,049
Doctor, we don't have any more time
for any of this now.

866
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:43,219
But we don't reckon time the same way,
do we, Clarice?

867
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:45,221
This is all the time you'll ever have.

868
01:09:45,264 --> 01:09:47,765
Later. Now, please, listen to me.
We've only got five...

869
01:09:47,808 --> 01:09:50,393
No! I will listen now.

870
01:09:53,397 --> 01:09:55,273
After your father's murder,
you were orphaned.

871
01:09:55,316 --> 01:09:56,566
You were ten years old.

872
01:09:56,609 --> 01:10:00,445
You went to live with cousins
on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana.

873
01:10:00,487 --> 01:10:01,613
And?

874
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:05,909
And one morning, I just ran away.

875
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:09,662
Not "just", Clarice. What set you off?

876
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:13,875
-You started at what time?
-Early. Still dark.

877
01:10:14,251 --> 01:10:18,254
Then something woke you, didn't it?
Was it a dream? What was it?

878
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:21,633
I heard a strange noise.

879
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:23,968
What was it?

880
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:28,056
It was screaming.

881
01:10:29,975 --> 01:10:32,977
Some kind of screaming,
like a child's voice.

882
01:10:33,354 --> 01:10:34,979
What did you do?

883
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:38,900
I went downstairs, outside.

884
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:43,780
I crept up into the barn.

885
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:47,533
I was so scared to look inside, but I had to.

886
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:51,871
And what did you see, Clarice?
What did you see?

887
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:57,168
Lambs. They were screaming.

888
01:10:58,337 --> 01:11:01,089
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?

889
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:03,508
And they were screaming.

890
01:11:04,718 --> 01:11:07,220
-And you ran away?
-No.

891
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:10,556
First I tried to free them.

892
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:13,559
I opened the gate to their pen,
but they wouldn't run.

893
01:11:13,644 --> 01:11:16,938
They just stood there, confused.
They wouldn't run.

894
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:20,024
But you could and you did, didn't you?

895
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:24,195
Yes. I took one lamb,
and I ran away as fast as I could.

896
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,864
-Where were you going, Clarice?
-I don't know.

897
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:31,661
I didn't have any food, any water,
and it was very cold, very cold.

898
01:11:34,331 --> 01:11:38,376
I thought if I could save just one, but,

899
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:42,588
he was so heavy.

900
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:45,216
He was so heavy.

901
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:54,851
I didn't get more than a few miles
when the sheriff's car picked me up.

902
01:11:57,563 --> 01:11:58,896
The rancher was so angry,

903
01:11:58,939 --> 01:12:02,442
he sent me to live
at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman.

904
01:12:02,526 --> 01:12:04,736
I never saw the ranch again.

905
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:07,780
What became of your lamb, Clarice?

906
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:11,617
They killed him.

907
01:12:11,702 --> 01:12:14,078
You still wake up sometimes, don't you?

908
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:18,750
Wake up in the dark
and hear the screaming of the lambs.

909
01:12:19,793 --> 01:12:20,918
Yes.

910
01:12:22,629 --> 01:12:26,924
And you think if you save poor Catherine,
you could make them stop, don't you?

911
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:29,385
You think if Catherine lives,

912
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:32,221
you won't wake up in the dark ever again

913
01:12:32,723 --> 01:12:35,350
to that awful screaming of the lambs.

914
01:12:36,727 --> 01:12:39,687
I don't know. I don't know.

915
01:12:41,899 --> 01:12:45,526
Thank you, Clarice. Thank you.

916
01:12:46,403 --> 01:12:48,446
Tell me his name, Doctor.

917
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:57,288
Dr. Chilton, I presume.

918
01:12:58,165 --> 01:13:00,333
I think you know each other.

919
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:03,294
Okay.

920
01:13:04,296 --> 01:13:06,297
-We found her.
-Let's go!

921
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:08,466
It's your turn, Doctor.

922
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:10,718
-Out.
-Tell me his name.

923
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:13,471
Sorry, ma'am, I've got orders.
I have to put you on a plane.

924
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:14,972
Come on now.

925
01:13:15,015 --> 01:13:16,557
Brave Clarice.

926
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:21,020
You will let me know when
those lambs stop screaming, won't you?

927
01:13:21,105 --> 01:13:23,106
Tell me his name, Doctor!

928
01:13:23,148 --> 01:13:24,440
Clarice!

929
01:13:25,776 --> 01:13:27,318
Your case file.

930
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:34,242
Goodbye, Clarice.

931
01:14:40,058 --> 01:14:42,059
Ready when you are, Doc.

932
01:14:42,227 --> 01:14:44,395
Just another minute, please.

933
01:14:53,363 --> 01:14:55,781
The son of a bitch
demanded a second dinner.

934
01:14:55,866 --> 01:14:57,909
Lamb chops, extra rare.

935
01:14:57,951 --> 01:14:59,911
Wonder what he wants for breakfast.

936
01:14:59,953 --> 01:15:02,246
Some damn thing from the zoo?

937
01:15:24,061 --> 01:15:25,853
Good evening, gentlemen.

938
01:15:25,938 --> 01:15:29,440
-Okay, Doc. Grab some floor.
-Same drill as before, please.

939
01:15:37,032 --> 01:15:39,575
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

940
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:56,926
Okay.

941
01:16:03,809 --> 01:16:05,810
Hand me that, would you?

942
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:12,191
Thanks.

943
01:16:16,029 --> 01:16:18,114
Mind the drawings, please.

944
01:16:21,159 --> 01:16:22,493
Thank you.

945
01:16:46,893 --> 01:16:49,186
-Jimmy, watch it! He's got me!
-Jesus, Bill!

946
01:16:56,194 --> 01:16:57,695
Jesus Christ!

947
01:18:16,274 --> 01:18:18,859
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

948
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:29,787
What is this shit?

949
01:18:32,582 --> 01:18:36,293
-Did somebody go up on five?
-No. Nobody went up.

950
01:18:36,628 --> 01:18:38,546
Call Pembry. Ask him...

951
01:18:41,174 --> 01:18:43,926
CP, shots fired on five. Repeat.

952
01:18:44,302 --> 01:18:46,846
-Shots fired on five.
-Sergeant Tate.

953
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:50,933
Holy shit.

954
01:18:50,976 --> 01:18:52,810
What the hell? Bitch!

955
01:18:53,353 --> 01:18:54,603
Shut up.

956
01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:57,440
-Bobby, get the vest.
-Right, Sarge.

957
01:18:58,108 --> 01:18:59,984
-Brady, Howard...
-Look!

958
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:04,530
It stopped.

959
01:19:06,032 --> 01:19:07,742
Seal off a 10 block radius.

960
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:10,661
Get me the SWAT team
and an ambulance double-quick.

961
01:19:10,704 --> 01:19:11,912
We're going up.

962
01:19:41,026 --> 01:19:42,651
Pembry!

963
01:19:44,154 --> 01:19:45,863
Boyle!

964
01:19:58,543 --> 01:19:59,752
Oh, God!

965
01:20:07,052 --> 01:20:08,052
Go.

966
01:20:15,894 --> 01:20:17,353
-Clear!
-Clear!

967
01:20:17,395 --> 01:20:20,397
Command post, two officers down.

968
01:20:20,774 --> 01:20:22,107
-Clear!
-Clear!

969
01:20:23,026 --> 01:20:24,401
Lecter's gone, Sarge.

970
01:20:24,444 --> 01:20:26,278
The prisoner is missing.

971
01:20:26,363 --> 01:20:28,280
Boyle's gun is gone, Sergeant.

972
01:20:28,365 --> 01:20:30,908
Repeat. Lecter is missing and armed.

973
01:20:31,034 --> 01:20:34,078
He stripped the bed.
Might be making a rope.

974
01:20:34,162 --> 01:20:35,830
Check all windows.

975
01:20:35,914 --> 01:20:38,249
Where the fuck is my ambulance?

976
01:20:38,917 --> 01:20:40,334
He's alive.

977
01:20:41,044 --> 01:20:43,087
Sergeant Tate, he's alive!

978
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:46,757
Get a hold of him where you can
feel his hands, son. Talk to him.

979
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:48,509
What do I say?

980
01:20:48,593 --> 01:20:51,387
It's Jim Pembry! Now talk to him, damn it!

981
01:20:52,389 --> 01:20:54,515
Lecter is missing and armed.

982
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:56,934
Pembry. Pembry, can you hear me?

983
01:20:57,018 --> 01:21:00,020
He took Boyle's gun.
Pembry got off one round.

984
01:21:00,105 --> 01:21:02,106
There's a chance Lecter was hit.

985
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:04,275
Keep breathing in and out. That's it.

986
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:07,611
You're doing a good job.
You look real good there.

987
01:21:08,363 --> 01:21:11,240
Yeah, you look... You look real good.

988
01:21:28,466 --> 01:21:29,592
-You ready?
-Let's go.

989
01:21:29,634 --> 01:21:31,552
-Let's do it.
-Let's go.

990
01:21:42,647 --> 01:21:44,815
Looking good, Pembry.
You're gonna make it.

991
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,984
You're just fine. You're doing all right.
That's right.

992
01:21:47,068 --> 01:21:49,486
-Okay, I need that IV now.
-Lactated ringers.

993
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:50,821
Can we get the strap?

994
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:51,947
Where's the fucking oxygen?

995
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:53,741
-Looking good, buddy. That's right.
-Bob!

996
01:21:53,825 --> 01:21:55,659
Stay with me. Stay with me here.

997
01:21:57,329 --> 01:21:59,538
We're losing him. Downstairs. Take him!

998
01:22:00,332 --> 01:22:01,540
And up!

999
01:22:03,126 --> 01:22:04,251
-Elevator!
-Out of the way!

1000
01:22:04,336 --> 01:22:05,836
Out of the way!

1001
01:22:10,675 --> 01:22:12,009
CP to Tate.

1002
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:14,929
Roger, Lieutenant. Tate here.

1003
01:22:15,639 --> 01:22:18,474
I'm on the elevator bringing Pembry down.

1004
01:22:18,725 --> 01:22:20,768
He seems to be hanging on.

1005
01:22:21,394 --> 01:22:23,395
Top three floors secured.

1006
01:22:24,022 --> 01:22:25,940
Main stairwell secured.

1007
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:28,817
We think he's on two.

1008
01:22:42,123 --> 01:22:44,249
Tate, are you still with me?

1009
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:48,629
We're pretty sure
he's somewhere on two, sir.

1010
01:22:48,713 --> 01:22:50,714
That's all for now. Over.

1011
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:12,569
He's on the roof of the elevator.

1012
01:23:15,365 --> 01:23:16,740
Okay, guys.

1013
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:34,675
I see him.

1014
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:37,720
There's a gun by his hand.
He's not moving.

1015
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:39,888
One warning. We need him alive.

1016
01:23:39,931 --> 01:23:41,265
Got him.

1017
01:23:41,891 --> 01:23:43,100
Lecter.

1018
01:23:43,518 --> 01:23:45,686
Put your hands on your head.

1019
01:23:47,772 --> 01:23:49,314
One in the leg.

1020
01:24:00,326 --> 01:24:01,744
No movement.

1021
01:24:03,079 --> 01:24:06,165
Johnny, hold your fire.
We're coming into the car.

1022
01:24:06,249 --> 01:24:09,501
-We're opening the hatch.
-Watch his hands.

1023
01:24:09,627 --> 01:24:12,796
If there's any fire,
it'll come from us. Affirm.

1024
01:24:13,006 --> 01:24:14,214
Got it.

1025
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:42,284
Memphis General, this is Medical Unit 26.

1026
01:24:42,327 --> 01:24:44,953
We're inbound with a 50-year-old
male police officer

1027
01:24:44,996 --> 01:24:47,456
with severe facial lacerations.
Weapon unknown.

1028
01:24:47,499 --> 01:24:50,501
We've got grand mal seizure activity,
but he's postictal now.

1029
01:24:50,585 --> 01:24:51,668
Copy that.

1030
01:24:51,711 --> 01:24:54,630
Vital signs are good.
Pressure is 130 over 90.

1031
01:24:54,672 --> 01:24:56,173
-Ninety?
-Yeah, that's right. 90.

1032
01:24:56,257 --> 01:24:57,508
Pulse, 84.

1033
01:24:57,592 --> 01:24:59,259
We've got him on lactated ringers running.

1034
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:01,887
And the patient is on 10 liters...

1035
01:25:09,062 --> 01:25:12,356
They found the ambulance
in a parking garage at Memphis Airport.

1036
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:13,941
The crew was dead.

1037
01:25:15,026 --> 01:25:18,529
He killed a tourist, too.
Got his clothes, cash.

1038
01:25:19,155 --> 01:25:21,156
By now he could be anywhere.

1039
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:23,200
-He won't come after me.
-Oh, really?

1040
01:25:23,284 --> 01:25:25,744
No, he won't. I can't explain it.

1041
01:25:25,829 --> 01:25:28,455
He would consider that rude.

1042
01:25:29,666 --> 01:25:31,542
It's over. She's dead.

1043
01:25:31,751 --> 01:25:33,669
It's not your fault it worked out like this.

1044
01:25:33,711 --> 01:25:35,546
The thing is that,
Lecter said everything we need

1045
01:25:35,588 --> 01:25:38,173
to catch him with is right here
in these pages, only I can't...

1046
01:25:38,216 --> 01:25:41,969
-Dr. Lecter said a lot of things.
-He's here, Ardelia.

1047
01:26:11,791 --> 01:26:13,417
Is this Lecter's handwriting?

1048
01:26:15,587 --> 01:26:18,297
"Clarice, doesn't this random scattering
of sites

1049
01:26:18,381 --> 01:26:22,384
"seem desperately random?
Like the elaboration of a bad liar.

1050
01:26:22,635 --> 01:26:24,261
"Ta, Hannibal Lecter."

1051
01:26:24,345 --> 01:26:27,014
Desperately random? What does he mean?

1052
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:30,267
Not random at all maybe.
Like there's some pattern here.

1053
01:26:31,686 --> 01:26:34,938
Yeah, but there is no pattern,
or the computers would have nailed it.

1054
01:26:35,023 --> 01:26:36,857
They're even found in random order.

1055
01:26:37,442 --> 01:26:41,069
Random because of the one girl.
The one he weighted down.

1056
01:26:41,946 --> 01:26:43,697
-Fredrica Bimmel...
-Right.

1057
01:26:43,781 --> 01:26:47,075
From Belvedere, Ohio.

1058
01:26:47,535 --> 01:26:51,163
First girl taken, third body found. Why?

1059
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:53,624
Well, she didn't drift.
He weighted her down.

1060
01:26:53,708 --> 01:26:56,793
What did Lecter say
about the first principles?

1061
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:58,545
Simplicity.

1062
01:26:58,963 --> 01:27:01,465
What does this guy do? He covets.

1063
01:27:02,425 --> 01:27:04,718
How do we first start to covet?

1064
01:27:05,345 --> 01:27:07,971
-We covet what we see...
-Every day.

1065
01:27:10,642 --> 01:27:13,143
-Hot damn, Clarice.
-He knew her.

1066
01:28:29,053 --> 01:28:31,221
-Mr. Bimmel?
-That's me.

1067
01:28:32,223 --> 01:28:35,058
Hello. I'm Clarice Starling.
I'm with the FBI.

1068
01:28:38,604 --> 01:28:41,773
I sure appreciate you letting me
take a look around, Mr. Bimmel.

1069
01:28:42,525 --> 01:28:44,776
I don't know nothing new to tell you.

1070
01:28:44,861 --> 01:28:48,071
Police been back here
so many times already.

1071
01:28:48,448 --> 01:28:52,034
Fredrica went into Chicago on the bus
to see about a job.

1072
01:28:52,744 --> 01:28:55,912
She left the interview okay.
She never come home.

1073
01:28:59,083 --> 01:29:01,335
Her bedroom's how she left it.

1074
01:29:01,669 --> 01:29:04,254
Upstairs. Door to the left.

1075
01:31:50,046 --> 01:31:53,256
He's making himself a woman suit,
Mr. Crawford, out of real women.

1076
01:31:53,299 --> 01:31:56,259
And he can sew, this guy.
He's very skilled.

1077
01:31:56,344 --> 01:31:58,803
-He's a tailor or a dressmaker or...
-Starling...

1078
01:31:58,888 --> 01:32:01,306
That's why they're all so big.
He has to keep them alive

1079
01:32:01,390 --> 01:32:02,474
so he can starve them a while,

1080
01:32:02,558 --> 01:32:04,434
-so he can loosen their skin and take...
-Starling.

1081
01:32:04,519 --> 01:32:07,103
Starling. Starling,
we know who he is and where he is.

1082
01:32:07,146 --> 01:32:09,439
-We're on our way right now.
-Where?

1083
01:32:09,690 --> 01:32:14,402
Calumet City, edge of Chicago.
Be on the ground in 45 minutes with HRT.

1084
01:32:14,445 --> 01:32:16,863
Oh, that's great news, sir, but how...

1085
01:32:16,948 --> 01:32:18,865
Johns Hopkins came up with some names.

1086
01:32:18,991 --> 01:32:20,450
We fed him into "Known Offenders."

1087
01:32:20,618 --> 01:32:24,704
Subject's name is Jamie Gumb,
AKA John Grant.

1088
01:32:24,914 --> 01:32:27,290
Lecter's description is accurate.
He just lied about the name.

1089
01:32:27,375 --> 01:32:28,458
Listen to this.

1090
01:32:28,668 --> 01:32:30,919
Customs had some paper on him.

1091
01:32:31,128 --> 01:32:34,089
They stopped a carton two years ago
at LAX.

1092
01:32:34,298 --> 01:32:36,633
Live caterpillars from Surinam.

1093
01:32:36,676 --> 01:32:39,261
The addressee was a Jame Gumb.

1094
01:32:40,179 --> 01:32:42,180
Well, Chicago's only 400 miles from here.

1095
01:32:42,265 --> 01:32:44,057
-I'll be there in...
-No, no, no, Starling.

1096
01:32:44,141 --> 01:32:47,435
There's not enough time.
We want him for murder, not kidnapping.

1097
01:32:47,603 --> 01:32:50,021
I need you to link him to the Bimmel girl
before he's indicted.

1098
01:32:50,106 --> 01:32:54,150
-See what you can dredge up in Belvedere.
-Yes, sir. You bet. I'll do my best.

1099
01:32:54,277 --> 01:32:57,529
Starling, we wouldn't have found him
without you.

1100
01:32:58,114 --> 01:33:01,408
Nobody's gonna forget that.
Least of all me.

1101
01:33:02,994 --> 01:33:06,162
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much, Mr. Crawford.

1102
01:33:07,915 --> 01:33:09,332
Mr. Crawford?

1103
01:33:21,929 --> 01:33:25,849
Thanks for the scraps, asshole.
I got a better idea.

1104
01:33:47,830 --> 01:33:50,206
Okay, Precious. Time for a little treat.

1105
01:34:03,346 --> 01:34:04,638
Precious!

1106
01:34:07,224 --> 01:34:08,725
Come on, girl!

1107
01:34:09,935 --> 01:34:12,562
Come on, Precious. Come on, Precious!

1108
01:34:21,697 --> 01:34:23,406
Come on, Precious!

1109
01:34:23,699 --> 01:34:26,242
I got a yummy, yummy snack for you.

1110
01:34:26,577 --> 01:34:28,036
Come on. Come and get it.

1111
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:36,252
Precious!

1112
01:34:37,213 --> 01:34:39,631
Are you up there, you little shit?

1113
01:34:40,508 --> 01:34:42,759
Come and get it, pretty girl.

1114
01:34:49,850 --> 01:34:53,436
Precious. Please come. Come on.

1115
01:35:01,404 --> 01:35:02,821
Come on...

1116
01:35:15,209 --> 01:35:16,876
Would you fuck me?

1117
01:35:17,128 --> 01:35:19,587
Come on. Take that bone. Come on.

1118
01:35:20,798 --> 01:35:23,591
Come on. Come. Come on.

1119
01:35:23,968 --> 01:35:25,427
I'd fuck me.

1120
01:35:26,011 --> 01:35:27,303
Come on.

1121
01:35:31,308 --> 01:35:33,017
I'd fuck me hard.

1122
01:35:33,477 --> 01:35:35,311
I'd fuck me so hard.

1123
01:35:40,192 --> 01:35:41,276
No.

1124
01:36:42,379 --> 01:36:44,547
Is that a good job, FBI agent?

1125
01:36:44,632 --> 01:36:48,802
You get to travel around and stuff?
I mean, better places than this?

1126
01:36:50,471 --> 01:36:52,096
Sometimes you do.

1127
01:36:52,932 --> 01:36:56,684
Freddie was so happy for me
when I got this job at the bank.

1128
01:36:57,436 --> 01:37:01,231
Toaster giveaways and Barry Manilow
on the speakers all day.

1129
01:37:01,482 --> 01:37:03,900
She thought it was such hot shit.

1130
01:37:04,527 --> 01:37:06,736
What did she know? Big dummy.

1131
01:37:07,029 --> 01:37:09,280
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man

1132
01:37:09,365 --> 01:37:12,992
named Jamie Gumb or a Jame Gumb?

1133
01:37:13,828 --> 01:37:15,912
-How about John Grant?
-No.

1134
01:37:16,330 --> 01:37:17,330
Oh, would she have had a friend

1135
01:37:17,414 --> 01:37:18,623
that you didn't know about, or...

1136
01:37:18,707 --> 01:37:21,501
No way. If she had a guy, I'd have known,
believe me.

1137
01:37:21,585 --> 01:37:23,378
Sewing was her life.

1138
01:37:23,921 --> 01:37:25,797
Did you two ever work together?

1139
01:37:25,881 --> 01:37:27,882
Oh, sure. Me and Pam Malavesi
used to help her

1140
01:37:27,925 --> 01:37:30,468
do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman.

1141
01:37:30,928 --> 01:37:33,930
Can you give me Mrs. Lippman's address?
I need to talk to her.

1142
01:38:02,626 --> 01:38:05,628
So powerful. So beautiful.

1143
01:38:11,218 --> 01:38:12,510
Precious?

1144
01:38:18,475 --> 01:38:19,517
Precious?

1145
01:38:19,602 --> 01:38:21,811
Down here, you sack of shit!

1146
01:38:30,654 --> 01:38:31,779
Put her in that bucket.

1147
01:38:31,822 --> 01:38:35,366
No! You get me a telephone
and lower it down here. Now!

1148
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:40,496
Poolie-poo. Precious.

1149
01:38:40,789 --> 01:38:42,457
Darling heart, are you all right?

1150
01:38:42,499 --> 01:38:45,668
She's in a lot of pain, mister.
She needs a vet.

1151
01:38:49,715 --> 01:38:52,675
She broke her leg on the way down.
I know it. She's been licking...

1152
01:38:52,718 --> 01:38:54,802
Hey, don't you hurt my dog!

1153
01:38:54,845 --> 01:38:59,223
-Don't you make me hurt your dog!
-Oh, you don't know what pain is!

1154
01:39:04,521 --> 01:39:08,358
Get me a live telephone line down here
or the dog's dead!

1155
01:39:12,696 --> 01:39:13,738
Damn fuck.

1156
01:39:13,822 --> 01:39:15,698
Get me that telephone!

1157
01:39:17,242 --> 01:39:19,202
I'm gonna do it, mister!

1158
01:39:19,495 --> 01:39:22,830
I'll snap her neck off. I swear to God!

1159
01:39:23,916 --> 01:39:25,541
You little fuck.

1160
01:39:32,549 --> 01:39:35,093
Down here! Down here!

1161
01:39:35,177 --> 01:39:36,469
Help!

1162
01:39:49,149 --> 01:39:51,067
Okay, I'm coming.

1163
01:39:53,153 --> 01:39:54,696
We're going in.

1164
01:39:59,368 --> 01:40:01,911
Good afternoon. Sorry to bother you.

1165
01:40:02,329 --> 01:40:04,080
I'm looking for Mrs. Lippman's family.

1166
01:40:04,748 --> 01:40:07,500
-FBI! Everybody down!
-Everybody down, now!

1167
01:40:07,835 --> 01:40:09,460
No. The Lippmans don't live here anymore.

1168
01:40:09,545 --> 01:40:12,630
No. Excuse me, sir.
I really need to speak with you.

1169
01:40:13,590 --> 01:40:15,341
-Clear!
-Clear!

1170
01:40:16,135 --> 01:40:18,386
What's the problem, Officer?

1171
01:40:18,470 --> 01:40:21,931
Well, I'm investigating the death
of Fredrica Bimmel.

1172
01:40:24,685 --> 01:40:26,185
There's no one here, Jack.

1173
01:40:28,647 --> 01:40:29,939
Clarice.

1174
01:40:30,190 --> 01:40:31,399
Your name is?

1175
01:40:31,442 --> 01:40:34,068
-Oh, Jack Gordon.
-Mr. Gordon. Good.

1176
01:40:34,987 --> 01:40:38,448
Well, Fredrica used to work
for Mrs. Lippman. Did you know her?

1177
01:40:39,116 --> 01:40:40,450
No.

1178
01:40:41,452 --> 01:40:42,702
Oh, wait.

1179
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:45,413
Was she a great, big fat person?

1180
01:40:46,248 --> 01:40:48,958
-Yes. She was a big girl, sir.
-Yeah, I...

1181
01:40:49,293 --> 01:40:52,128
I may have...
No, I read about her in the newspaper.

1182
01:40:54,131 --> 01:40:56,591
Mrs. Lippman had a son.
Maybe he could help you.

1183
01:40:56,633 --> 01:41:00,011
I got his card in here someplace.
Do you want to come in while I look for it?

1184
01:41:00,095 --> 01:41:01,304
-May I?
-Yeah, sure.

1185
01:41:01,346 --> 01:41:02,680
Thank you.

1186
01:41:21,450 --> 01:41:23,951
Are you close to catching somebody,
you think?

1187
01:41:25,037 --> 01:41:26,996
Yes. We may be.

1188
01:41:29,458 --> 01:41:30,666
Did you

1189
01:41:31,627 --> 01:41:34,754
take over this place
after Mrs. Lippman died? Is that right?

1190
01:41:36,507 --> 01:41:40,551
Yeah. I bought this house two years ago.

1191
01:41:42,096 --> 01:41:45,223
Did she leave any records,
any business records,

1192
01:41:45,682 --> 01:41:48,768
tax forms, list of employees?

1193
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:52,188
No. Nothing like that at all.

1194
01:41:54,483 --> 01:41:56,984
Say, has the FBI learned something?

1195
01:41:57,361 --> 01:42:00,238
The police around here
don't seem to have the first clue.

1196
01:42:10,249 --> 01:42:14,877
I mean, have you got, like, a description,
fingerprints, anything like that?

1197
01:42:16,338 --> 01:42:17,380
No.

1198
01:42:20,259 --> 01:42:21,717
No, we don't.

1199
01:42:31,186 --> 01:42:33,771
Yeah. Here's that number.

1200
01:42:35,858 --> 01:42:39,193
Very good, Mr. Gordon.
May I use your phone, please?

1201
01:42:47,744 --> 01:42:49,787
Sure you can use my phone.

1202
01:42:51,206 --> 01:42:52,415
Freeze!

1203
01:42:53,208 --> 01:42:56,752
Put your hands over your head!
And turn around! Spread your legs!

1204
01:42:58,338 --> 01:43:01,841
Spread your legs!
Put your hands in the back! Thumbs up!

1205
01:43:01,925 --> 01:43:02,925
Freeze!

1206
01:44:15,916 --> 01:44:17,416
Hey!

1207
01:44:37,646 --> 01:44:39,563
Hello! Are you there?

1208
01:44:41,525 --> 01:44:43,859
I'm down here! I'm down here!

1209
01:45:03,964 --> 01:45:06,716
-Catherine Martin?
-Yes!

1210
01:45:08,844 --> 01:45:11,262
FBI! You're safe!

1211
01:45:11,847 --> 01:45:14,223
Safe, shit! Get me out of here!

1212
01:45:29,906 --> 01:45:31,949
You're all right, Catherine. Where is he?

1213
01:45:32,034 --> 01:45:35,077
How the fuck should I know?
Just get me out of here!

1214
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:38,247
Catherine, you've got to be quiet.
Now shut that dog up!

1215
01:45:38,332 --> 01:45:40,416
Just get me out of here!

1216
01:45:41,543 --> 01:45:42,918
Oh, my God.

1217
01:45:45,339 --> 01:45:47,631
Catherine, I'm going to get you
out of there,

1218
01:45:47,716 --> 01:45:49,425
but right now, you listen to me.

1219
01:45:49,551 --> 01:45:52,053
I've got to leave this room.
I'll be right back.

1220
01:45:52,095 --> 01:45:54,889
No! Don't you leave me here,
you fucking bitch!

1221
01:45:54,931 --> 01:45:57,433
No! Don't you leave me here!

1222
01:45:57,601 --> 01:45:59,894
This guy's fucking crazy!

1223
01:46:02,773 --> 01:46:04,398
Please!

1224
01:46:04,566 --> 01:46:07,818
I've got to get out of here!

1225
01:46:10,280 --> 01:46:14,241
Catherine, the other officers will be here
any minute now!

1226
01:46:15,243 --> 01:46:16,494
Wait!

1227
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:18,954
Don't go! Please!

1228
01:46:19,081 --> 01:46:20,247
Quiet!

1229
01:46:22,793 --> 01:46:24,210
Oh, God!

1230
01:50:11,187 --> 01:50:12,187
No...

1231
01:50:21,239 --> 01:50:23,616
-You okay?
-Gunpowder. It's nothing. I'm okay.

1232
01:50:23,700 --> 01:50:26,827
Agent Starling, how did you track
Buffalo Bill to this address?

1233
01:50:33,043 --> 01:50:35,544
Clarice M. Starling.

1234
01:50:38,048 --> 01:50:39,673
Congratulations.

1235
01:50:52,896 --> 01:50:55,064
Ernest W. Stevens.

1236
01:51:13,667 --> 01:51:16,877
-Special Agent Starling.
-Oh, Special Agent Mapp.

1237
01:51:17,087 --> 01:51:18,504
-Phone call.
-Thank you.

1238
01:51:18,588 --> 01:51:20,923
-Excuse me, gentlemen.
-Starling.

1239
01:51:23,677 --> 01:51:26,136
Pilch, could you take our picture?

1240
01:51:26,680 --> 01:51:27,763
Sure.

1241
01:51:29,265 --> 01:51:32,101
Look, I just wanted to say congratulations.

1242
01:51:32,477 --> 01:51:34,395
And I'm not much good
at this kind of thing,

1243
01:51:34,437 --> 01:51:36,271
so I'm gonna duck out of here.

1244
01:51:36,314 --> 01:51:37,606
Okay, sure.

1245
01:51:39,317 --> 01:51:41,235
Thank you, Mr. Crawford.

1246
01:51:48,868 --> 01:51:51,620
Your father would have been proud today.

1247
01:51:54,541 --> 01:51:56,750
Don't forget your phone call.

1248
01:52:00,964 --> 01:52:02,297
Starling.

1249
01:52:02,465 --> 01:52:06,802
Well, Clarice,
have the lambs stopped screaming?

1250
01:52:07,470 --> 01:52:08,637
Dr. Lecter.

1251
01:52:08,888 --> 01:52:11,807
Don't bother with a trace.
I won't be on long enough.

1252
01:52:15,478 --> 01:52:19,690
-Where are you, Dr. Lecter?
-I have no plans to call on you, Clarice.

1253
01:52:19,774 --> 01:52:22,276
The world's more interesting
with you in it.

1254
01:52:22,819 --> 01:52:25,988
So you take care now
to extend me the same courtesy.

1255
01:52:26,030 --> 01:52:28,490
You know I can't make that promise.

1256
01:52:29,033 --> 01:52:31,702
I do wish we could chat longer, but...

1257
01:52:32,746 --> 01:52:35,330
I'm having an old friend for dinner.

1258
01:52:36,875 --> 01:52:37,958
Bye.

1259
01:52:38,585 --> 01:52:40,002
Dr. Lecter...

1260
01:52:42,464 --> 01:52:43,839
Dr. Lecter.

1261
01:52:46,134 --> 01:52:47,509
Dr. Lecter.

1262
01:52:49,512 --> 01:52:50,846
Dr. Lecter.

1263
01:52:51,389 --> 01:52:53,515
Hey, what? Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.

1264
01:52:53,850 --> 01:52:56,810
-Is the security system all set up?
-We have the big-shot security.
