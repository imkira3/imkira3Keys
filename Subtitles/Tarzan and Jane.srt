PHIL COLLINS..
# Put your faith in #

3
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:28,239
# What you most believe in #

4
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:32,020
# Two worlds, one family #

5
00:00:32,054 --> 00:00:33,941
# Trust your heart #

6
00:00:33,974 --> 00:00:36,013
# Let fate decide #

7
00:00:36,053 --> 00:00:38,421
# To guide these lives #

8
00:00:38,454 --> 00:00:41,302
# To guide these lives
we see #

9
00:00:41,334 --> 00:00:44,333
CHORUS.. # Put your faith
in what you most believe in #

10
00:00:44,374 --> 00:00:49,195
ALL..
# Two worlds, one family #

11
00:00:54,005 --> 00:00:56,242
Ha ha ha ha ha!

12
00:00:56,278 --> 00:00:59,440
Goodness! Have we ever
gone that fast before?

13
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:01,168
Let's leap off
the waterfalls next.

14
00:01:01,205 --> 00:01:03,244
Oh, no, Tarzan, dear.

15
00:01:03,284 --> 00:01:05,194
I think I'll pass this time.

16
00:01:06,163 --> 00:01:08,651
Really?
Aren't you having fun?

17
00:01:08,691 --> 00:01:11,147
Oh, yes! I'd love
to spend the afternoon...

18
00:01:11,188 --> 00:01:12,432
swinging through the trees...

19
00:01:12,467 --> 00:01:13,874
and leaping
off the waterfalls...

20
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:17,617
but I have
some things to do. Yes.

21
00:01:17,652 --> 00:01:19,539
Like what?

22
00:01:19,571 --> 00:01:23,116
Well, like, um... laundry.

23
00:01:23,154 --> 00:01:25,707
Yes. Look at how dingy
this skirt is.

24
00:01:25,747 --> 00:01:27,470
Absolutely filthy.

25
00:01:27,506 --> 00:01:29,448
Yes. Much laundry to do.

26
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:31,280
Far too much to
allow me to go playing...

27
00:01:31,314 --> 00:01:33,964
and waterfall leaping
and all those wonderful things.

28
00:01:34,002 --> 00:01:37,318
So, run along
and see those falls.

29
00:01:37,362 --> 00:01:39,729
Well, if that's what you want.

30
00:01:39,762 --> 00:01:42,128
It is.
It's absolutely what I want.

31
00:01:42,162 --> 00:01:43,591
Now, you run along.

32
00:01:51,313 --> 00:01:52,426
Oh!

33
00:01:52,465 --> 00:01:55,050
What was that all about?

34
00:01:55,088 --> 00:01:56,998
Why are you trying
to ditch Tarzan?

35
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:59,244
Why, Terk. Ha ha ha!

36
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,214
I haven't the faintest idea
what you're talking about.

37
00:02:03,216 --> 00:02:06,062
Very well.

38
00:02:06,095 --> 00:02:08,845
You caught me.

39
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,918
You see, today marks
the first anniversary...

40
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,748
of my marriage to Tarzan.

41
00:02:12,783 --> 00:02:13,896
Get out!

42
00:02:13,936 --> 00:02:16,106
You kids have been married
a year already?

43
00:02:16,143 --> 00:02:19,175
Yes. One year to the day.

44
00:02:19,214 --> 00:02:21,254
Now, in England,
couples do special things...

45
00:02:21,294 --> 00:02:22,756
for each other
on their anniversaries...

46
00:02:22,798 --> 00:02:25,132
so I was thinking perhaps
a party or some such.

47
00:02:25,167 --> 00:02:27,402
Oh, Tarzan
will be so surprised...

48
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:29,478
when he steps into
the treehouse and sees-

49
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:32,200
Jane, you sure
this is a good idea?

50
00:02:32,237 --> 00:02:33,994
What do you mean, Terk?

51
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:38,120
Well, Tarzan
kind of has a hard time...

52
00:02:38,157 --> 00:02:41,452
fitting into
your British social events.

53
00:02:41,486 --> 00:02:43,853
Like, remember when your
three friends came to visit?

54
00:02:43,885 --> 00:02:44,996
Oh, I remember this.

55
00:02:46,188 --> 00:02:48,490
It all started
innocently enough...

56
00:02:48,525 --> 00:02:51,371
just a pleasant afternoon
in the jungle.

57
00:02:59,756 --> 00:03:01,163
Aah!

58
00:03:01,196 --> 00:03:03,235
- Gotcha!
- Ha ha ha!

59
00:03:03,275 --> 00:03:06,176
Yes, but you've got to admit...

60
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:08,640
that I'm getting better
at treetop tag.

61
00:03:08,683 --> 00:03:10,918
Yes. You act more
like an ape every day.

62
00:03:10,954 --> 00:03:14,663
Like an ape?
Uhh! Well, I never...

63
00:03:16,298 --> 00:03:18,186
heard such a sweet sentiment.

64
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,065
Run!

65
00:03:21,097 --> 00:03:22,658
They're comin'!

66
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:24,995
Who?

67
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:28,995
Unhand her,
you savage wild man!

68
00:03:29,033 --> 00:03:32,098
- Eleanor?
- Hey! Ow!

69
00:03:32,137 --> 00:03:35,137
JANE.. Eleanor!
Greenly! Hazel!

70
00:03:36,872 --> 00:03:38,596
What are you doing?

71
00:03:38,632 --> 00:03:40,519
We've come to rescue you.

72
00:03:40,552 --> 00:03:41,829
Rescue?

73
00:03:41,864 --> 00:03:43,238
- Stay back!
- Keep away!

74
00:03:43,272 --> 00:03:45,377
Come, Jane! Hurry!

75
00:03:48,457 --> 00:03:50,944
Aah! Greenly!

76
00:03:50,984 --> 00:03:53,023
Back! Back! Captain Jerrold!

77
00:03:53,063 --> 00:03:54,624
Help us!

78
00:03:56,744 --> 00:03:59,907
Good day, Miss Porter, Tarzan.

79
00:03:59,943 --> 00:04:01,351
Captain Jerrold.

80
00:04:01,383 --> 00:04:03,838
Ladies, I'll be heading
back to the ship now.

81
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:05,505
Enjoy your visit.

82
00:04:05,543 --> 00:04:08,063
What? No!
Don't leave us here!

83
00:04:08,102 --> 00:04:09,347
Don't worry, Jane.

84
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:12,165
We'll protect you
from the savage wild man.

85
00:04:12,198 --> 00:04:13,922
No, no. You don't understand.

86
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:17,154
No, let go.
Let go! Let - let go!

87
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:19,523
I don't need to be rescued.

88
00:04:19,557 --> 00:04:20,866
I tried to tell them...

89
00:04:20,902 --> 00:04:22,691
that you stayed behind
by your own choice...

90
00:04:22,726 --> 00:04:24,831
and that you were
perfectly safe and happy...

91
00:04:24,869 --> 00:04:27,421
here in the jungle,
but they wouldn't listen.

92
00:04:27,461 --> 00:04:29,949
And then, when I told them
about the wild man-

93
00:04:29,989 --> 00:04:31,516
Savage wild man.

94
00:04:31,557 --> 00:04:35,169
Ha ha!
Tarzan is not a savage wild man.

95
00:04:35,205 --> 00:04:39,231
You see, he was raised
from infancy by gorillas.

96
00:04:39,269 --> 00:04:40,990
Of course. Yes.

97
00:04:41,027 --> 00:04:43,231
One of your father's
science projects.

98
00:04:43,268 --> 00:04:46,431
Perhaps you could put it
back in its cage now.

99
00:04:46,468 --> 00:04:48,889
Cage? He's got a cage?

100
00:04:48,931 --> 00:04:52,030
No, no, no.
You don't understand.

101
00:04:52,068 --> 00:04:54,685
Tarzan's not a science project.

102
00:04:54,723 --> 00:04:56,633
He's my husband.

103
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:00,891
You see, Professor, when you
didn't return to England...

104
00:05:00,931 --> 00:05:02,173
with Jane as scheduled...

105
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,065
we were sure
that something-Uhh!

106
00:05:04,098 --> 00:05:07,611
Something terrible
must have happened...

107
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:08,794
to keep you here.

108
00:05:08,834 --> 00:05:12,630
Yes,
and then we heard the rumors.

109
00:05:12,674 --> 00:05:14,332
Rumors? Oh, my.

110
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,540
We never meant to cause
so much worry.

111
00:05:16,578 --> 00:05:19,424
Well, as you can see,
we couldn't be better.

112
00:05:19,457 --> 00:05:20,668
Tea?

113
00:05:23,648 --> 00:05:26,584
What an unusual flavor.

114
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,959
- Do I taste a hint of-
- Dirt?

115
00:05:28,993 --> 00:05:32,253
Well, maybe just a hint.
Sorry.

116
00:05:32,288 --> 00:05:37,022
It's the best we can do with
dried figs and banana leaves.

117
00:05:37,055 --> 00:05:39,739
Oh, you've done
a splendid job...

118
00:05:39,777 --> 00:05:41,751
considering
the, uh, you know...

119
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:44,061
circumstances.

120
00:05:44,096 --> 00:05:47,390
You have quite
a quaintly-crafted home here.

121
00:05:47,423 --> 00:05:49,789
Yes, it does have
its own charm, doesn't it?

122
00:05:49,822 --> 00:05:53,750
In fact, it was originally
built by Tarzan's parents.

123
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:57,913
Really? Tarzan, do tell us
more about your family.

124
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:00,700
I- I never knew them.

125
00:06:00,734 --> 00:06:03,101
- Poor dear.
- That's very sad.

126
00:06:03,134 --> 00:06:05,981
They were killed
by Sabor, the leopard...

127
00:06:06,014 --> 00:06:07,355
- Oh!
- Oh!

128
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,463
- In this room.
- Oh!

129
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:10,613
Right there.

130
00:06:10,652 --> 00:06:12,954
Oh, Tarzan!
If it's not too much trouble...

131
00:06:12,989 --> 00:06:15,127
do you think you could
gather some fruit, dear?

132
00:06:15,164 --> 00:06:16,474
I'll be right back.

133
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,094
JANE.. Oh, no. No hurry.
Really, take your time.

134
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,315
So, how's it going
with the troublemakers?

135
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:29,777
They aren't troublemakers.

136
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,195
They're Jane's friends.

137
00:06:31,228 --> 00:06:32,634
Eh, same thing.

138
00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:36,017
Personally, I don't trust
anyone who wears clothes.

139
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,783
What are they hidin', anyway?

140
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:41,495
I like Jane's friends.
They smell nice.

141
00:06:41,531 --> 00:06:43,735
Yeah, well,
they can smell all they want.

142
00:06:43,772 --> 00:06:46,356
I'm just saying,
keep your guard up, Tarzan.

143
00:06:46,395 --> 00:06:50,617
Pretty soon, Jane will want you
to act all civilized...

144
00:06:50,651 --> 00:06:53,911
and then it's
"Good-bye, vines. Hello, pants. "

145
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:55,986
Jane doesn't want to..

146
00:07:04,665 --> 00:07:07,415
- Aah!
- Nuru and Sheeta!

147
00:07:17,144 --> 00:07:20,177
Hah! Guess we showed them.

148
00:07:20,217 --> 00:07:23,565
ELEANOR..
Ha ha! Oh, dear, Jane.

149
00:07:23,607 --> 00:07:24,785
Tarzan's not at all
the type of man...

150
00:07:24,824 --> 00:07:26,416
we expected you
to settle down with.

151
00:07:26,455 --> 00:07:28,146
Not that
we don't see why you did.

152
00:07:28,183 --> 00:07:32,209
Quite. He's rather
robustly proportioned.

153
00:07:32,246 --> 00:07:34,635
Yes. I'm very happy...

154
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:36,533
living here
in the jungle with Tarzan.

155
00:07:36,566 --> 00:07:40,015
Happy? In the jungle?
Ha ha ha ha!

156
00:07:40,055 --> 00:07:42,389
My, you certainly have changed.

157
00:07:42,422 --> 00:07:45,007
Changed? In what way?

158
00:07:45,046 --> 00:07:47,664
Well, what Eleanor
is saying is...

159
00:07:47,702 --> 00:07:50,069
the Jane Porter we went
to finishing school with...

160
00:07:50,101 --> 00:07:52,852
was a proper lady,
and now, well...

161
00:07:52,886 --> 00:07:54,412
though it is quite lovely...

162
00:07:54,453 --> 00:07:56,461
you do live in
what is essentially..

163
00:07:56,501 --> 00:07:59,184
A tree. You live in a tree.

164
00:07:59,222 --> 00:08:01,110
But I'm still that proper lady.

165
00:08:01,142 --> 00:08:03,083
I'm still
the same Jane Porter...

166
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,815
that you went to
finishing school with.

167
00:08:04,853 --> 00:08:07,820
I mean, with whom
you went to finishing school.

168
00:08:07,861 --> 00:08:09,290
Yes.

169
00:08:09,332 --> 00:08:12,234
In fact, you'll be
very impressed to find...

170
00:08:12,276 --> 00:08:14,862
that I've already organized
a picnic for tomorrow.

171
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:17,583
Oh! I do love picnics.

172
00:08:17,619 --> 00:08:20,434
So put on
your Sunday best, ladies.

173
00:08:20,468 --> 00:08:21,896
You'll see
that here in the jungle...

174
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:23,761
we can be quite civilized.

175
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:27,886
I got fruit! Mmm.

176
00:08:31,731 --> 00:08:35,528
Oh, Tarzan, this is gonna be
absolutely splendid.

177
00:08:35,571 --> 00:08:38,352
We'll have lunch
and recite sonnets...

178
00:08:38,386 --> 00:08:39,663
and play badminton...

179
00:08:39,699 --> 00:08:42,764
just like those lovely picnics
I hosted in England.

180
00:08:42,802 --> 00:08:44,657
Anyone who was anyone
in English society...

181
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:49,000
always looked forward
to a Porter picnic.

182
00:08:49,042 --> 00:08:51,408
Be a dear and wear
your father's suit, would you?

183
00:08:51,441 --> 00:08:55,053
Hello, pants.
Good-bye, vines.

184
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:56,202
Why?

185
00:08:56,241 --> 00:08:59,623
In the civilized world,
men don't wear loincloths.

186
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:01,006
It's just not done.

187
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,633
I won't wear the suit.

188
00:09:02,672 --> 00:09:04,647
Why not?

189
00:09:04,688 --> 00:09:06,118
You're embarrassed by me.

190
00:09:06,161 --> 00:09:09,324
It's not like that at all.

191
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,815
I won't pretend
to be something I'm not.

192
00:09:11,856 --> 00:09:14,726
Tarzan! Oh.

193
00:09:18,384 --> 00:09:22,759
Gorgeous day
for a picnic, isn't it?

194
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:27,403
We aren't going much further,
are we, Jane, dear?

195
00:09:27,439 --> 00:09:30,754
I'm afraid..
I hate to be a bother, but..

196
00:09:30,798 --> 00:09:32,620
Our feet are killing us!

197
00:09:32,653 --> 00:09:34,247
It won't be long now.

198
00:09:34,286 --> 00:09:35,880
Aah! What was that?

199
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:38,569
Jane, I'm sorry to be
a nervous Nellie...

200
00:09:38,605 --> 00:09:40,394
but I thought
I heard something!

201
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:43,364
Oh, now, now.
Don't be frightened.

202
00:09:43,405 --> 00:09:45,576
Just look around you!
I sort of find it...

203
00:09:45,613 --> 00:09:48,199
rather like an English
garden with..

204
00:09:48,237 --> 00:09:52,132
An English garden
with a 15-foot python.

205
00:09:52,173 --> 00:09:57,672
So, where is your big, strong,
protective Tarzan, anyway?

206
00:09:57,709 --> 00:10:00,391
He was unable to attend.

207
00:10:00,428 --> 00:10:04,006
But perhaps you'll enjoy this.

208
00:10:04,044 --> 00:10:07,272
Oh! My word.

209
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:08,868
It's incredible.

210
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,754
S- s-spectacular.

211
00:10:11,787 --> 00:10:16,162
Ladies, welcome to my paradise.

212
00:10:28,554 --> 00:10:31,238
If I could
just get up this tree...

213
00:10:31,275 --> 00:10:32,288
Oh, dear.

214
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:34,441
- Professor?
- Yes, yes.

215
00:10:34,475 --> 00:10:37,408
I'm just on my way up
to see you.. Whoa! Oof!

216
00:10:37,449 --> 00:10:39,337
Ooh! No, no, no!

217
00:10:39,369 --> 00:10:41,256
I can manage. Heh.

218
00:10:41,289 --> 00:10:43,656
Whoa!

219
00:10:43,689 --> 00:10:45,477
Ha! Oh, dear!

220
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:47,520
Ha ha ha!

221
00:10:47,561 --> 00:10:50,462
What was it that you
wanted to see me about?

222
00:10:50,503 --> 00:10:52,774
You came to see me.

223
00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:54,302
Oh, right, right, right.

224
00:10:54,343 --> 00:10:59,559
I heard about
your little spat with Jane.

225
00:10:59,591 --> 00:11:01,348
She's embarrassed by me.

226
00:11:01,384 --> 00:11:03,424
You know Jane was raised
in a society...

227
00:11:03,464 --> 00:11:05,984
that sometimes values
what others think of you...

228
00:11:06,024 --> 00:11:08,641
more than what
you think of yourself.

229
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:10,948
That doesn't make any sense.

230
00:11:10,982 --> 00:11:14,464
No, no, no, no.
Much of society doesn't.

231
00:11:14,503 --> 00:11:16,957
If I may, Tarzan...

232
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:20,543
Jane lives in
your jungle world every day.

233
00:11:20,582 --> 00:11:23,103
Would it be
so terrible to live...

234
00:11:23,142 --> 00:11:26,370
in her civilized world
for just one?

235
00:11:26,406 --> 00:11:28,707
No. It wouldn't.

236
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,399
Thank you, Professor.

237
00:11:31,526 --> 00:11:33,914
That's my boy.
Ha ha ha ha!

238
00:11:33,957 --> 00:11:37,502
Eh... you'll, uh... Tarzan?

239
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,199
Yes, I should
like to get down now...

240
00:11:39,237 --> 00:11:42,466
if you don't... Hello? Hello!

241
00:11:44,677 --> 00:11:48,221
Oh, Jane, this is all so...

242
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,299
Delightful, Jane.

243
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:54,878
Perhaps the jungle
isn't so savage after all.

244
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:58,079
We can be quite civilized
when we want to be.

245
00:12:09,987 --> 00:12:12,442
N- now, listen to me, you cat..

246
00:12:12,483 --> 00:12:14,371
you don't even consider
making us your dinner...

247
00:12:14,403 --> 00:12:16,769
because, you see,
I mean, look at us.

248
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:18,941
We're thin.
We're nearly skin and bones...

249
00:12:18,978 --> 00:12:20,985
and I have it
on good authority...

250
00:12:21,026 --> 00:12:22,487
that the English
taste quite gamy.

251
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:23,991
Indeed!

252
00:12:24,033 --> 00:12:26,422
- Oh, yes! Quite gamy!
- And gristly!

253
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,968
Run!

254
00:12:34,176 --> 00:12:36,544
Up, up, up! Hurry!

255
00:12:36,577 --> 00:12:37,503
Oh! They're coming!

256
00:12:37,536 --> 00:12:39,446
- We're done for!
- Out of my way!

257
00:12:45,152 --> 00:12:46,559
What was that?

258
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,943
Aah! Ohh!

259
00:13:56,218 --> 00:13:59,698
Oh, my.
That was refreshing, wasn't it?

260
00:14:01,018 --> 00:14:03,057
Yes. Well... ahem.

261
00:14:03,097 --> 00:14:06,197
Jane, I don't suppose
you know where we are?

262
00:14:06,234 --> 00:14:10,095
Lost! Hopelessly lost
in a savage jungle!

263
00:14:10,137 --> 00:14:14,742
Well, that's a bit of
an exaggeration-a bit.

264
00:14:14,778 --> 00:14:17,494
It's getting dark.
What do we do?

265
00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:21,206
Now, girls, I've picked up
a thing or two from Tarzan...

266
00:14:21,241 --> 00:14:23,216
and if there's anyone
who eats, breathes...

267
00:14:23,257 --> 00:14:26,289
and sleeps the jungle,
it's Tarzan.

268
00:14:27,417 --> 00:14:32,501
TERK..
Introducing Mr. Fancypants!

269
00:14:32,537 --> 00:14:36,814
Oh, you look good, Tarzan.
Very civilized.

270
00:14:36,856 --> 00:14:39,376
Jane's gonna be so proud.

271
00:14:39,415 --> 00:14:41,585
TERK.. Aw, darn,
would you look at that?

272
00:14:41,623 --> 00:14:43,379
We missed the whole picnic.

273
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:44,528
Too bad.

274
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:47,795
Well, if somebody
didn't stop for termites...

275
00:14:47,831 --> 00:14:50,830
Like they would serve
anything decent at this picnic.

276
00:15:02,773 --> 00:15:04,977
Hey, fancypants, party's over.

277
00:15:05,014 --> 00:15:06,901
Come on.
Let's go chase the flamingos.

278
00:15:06,934 --> 00:15:09,933
Nuru and Sheeta were here.

279
00:15:09,973 --> 00:15:13,715
The panthers? Oh, no!

280
00:15:13,749 --> 00:15:16,431
Jane was always so nice...

281
00:15:16,468 --> 00:15:18,639
and her friends
smelled so pretty.

282
00:15:18,676 --> 00:15:21,010
Oh, why, cruel fate!

283
00:15:21,044 --> 00:15:24,426
Why?

284
00:15:24,468 --> 00:15:28,211
Will this interfere with
my flamingo chasing plan?

285
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,777
Jane and her friends
are still alive...

286
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:48,199
and we're going to find them.

287
00:15:48,242 --> 00:15:51,722
If we can just make it
to the baboon stream...

288
00:15:51,762 --> 00:15:54,575
we should be able to get home,
right, girls?

289
00:15:54,609 --> 00:15:56,748
Jane, dear, please.

290
00:15:56,785 --> 00:15:58,248
We're trying our best
to follow you...

291
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,816
but I'm afraid that, well-

292
00:15:59,857 --> 00:16:02,279
We're getting blisters!

293
00:16:02,321 --> 00:16:03,847
It's true.

294
00:16:03,888 --> 00:16:06,256
Oh, do forgive
my thoughtlessness.

295
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,744
Here. I know what will help.

296
00:16:08,785 --> 00:16:10,673
Oh, my shoes!

297
00:16:10,706 --> 00:16:12,680
You'll be able
to go much faster...

298
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:15,143
if we just make
a few minor adjustments...

299
00:16:15,185 --> 00:16:16,427
to the wardrobe.

300
00:16:16,464 --> 00:16:18,253
Oh, good heavens!

301
00:16:25,006 --> 00:16:29,316
No! Oh! Ooh!
But, Jane, they're Italian!

302
00:16:29,358 --> 00:16:30,788
They're patent leather!

303
00:16:30,831 --> 00:16:32,904
- They're...
- Shoes.

304
00:16:35,982 --> 00:16:38,153
Now, step lively, girls.

305
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:41,932
What if someone sees us?

306
00:16:41,966 --> 00:16:44,486
The only thing
we have to worry about...

307
00:16:44,526 --> 00:16:46,412
is them seeing us.

308
00:16:48,045 --> 00:16:50,500
How do we get around them?

309
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:53,224
It's dark. Now I'm scared.

310
00:16:53,261 --> 00:16:55,465
Hello! We're with Tarzan.

311
00:16:55,502 --> 00:16:57,257
Panthers run
at the mere sight of him.

312
00:16:57,292 --> 00:16:58,438
That was yesterday.

313
00:16:58,478 --> 00:17:00,844
Today, he's wearing pants.

314
00:17:00,876 --> 00:17:03,210
Huh. You got a point.

315
00:17:10,379 --> 00:17:12,321
This way!

316
00:17:12,363 --> 00:17:15,659
It's just a little algae.
It'll wash right off.

317
00:17:15,692 --> 00:17:18,179
Here.
We'll use these to breathe.

318
00:17:18,219 --> 00:17:20,585
Jane...
I'm not sure I understand.

319
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:22,180
You expect us to go under this...

320
00:17:22,219 --> 00:17:24,008
Filth?

321
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:25,417
It's the only way
the panthers...

322
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:28,004
will completely
lose our scent.

323
00:17:39,178 --> 00:17:41,545
Ahh! I think we've lost them.

324
00:17:41,578 --> 00:17:47,044
Aah! Leech! Get it off!
Ooh! Hurry!

325
00:17:47,082 --> 00:17:48,968
I'm growing faint! Aah!
Accursed leech-

326
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,975
it's sucking
my precious lifeblood!

327
00:17:51,016 --> 00:17:53,406
It's draining my marrow!
It's-

328
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,725
A leaf.

329
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,016
So much for keeping it quiet.

330
00:17:58,057 --> 00:17:59,430
Terribly sorry.

331
00:17:59,464 --> 00:18:00,708
Don't be, Greenly.

332
00:18:00,745 --> 00:18:03,559
Jane, what sort of outing
is this, anyway?

333
00:18:03,591 --> 00:18:06,079
First you strip us
to our unmentionables...

334
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,875
and then you shove us
into the muck.

335
00:18:07,911 --> 00:18:09,668
What will you have us do next?

336
00:18:09,703 --> 00:18:11,646
Grunt like gorillas
and swing from the trees?

337
00:18:11,687 --> 00:18:13,662
If it keeps us alive.

338
00:18:13,703 --> 00:18:16,070
In case you haven't noticed,
this is the jungle.

339
00:18:16,103 --> 00:18:17,860
It's not a garden party...

340
00:18:17,895 --> 00:18:19,357
and I never should have
pretended it was!

341
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:21,341
But right now,
our survival depends...

342
00:18:21,383 --> 00:18:24,165
upon you doing what I say
without argument!

343
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:25,889
Are we understood?

344
00:18:25,927 --> 00:18:28,828
That's more like it.

345
00:18:30,118 --> 00:18:31,776
Aah!

346
00:18:37,573 --> 00:18:41,251
So, would it help
if we grunted like gorillas?

347
00:19:02,277 --> 00:19:06,532
Oh, Tarzan! Thank heaven!

348
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:20,792
Oh, my! I never realized
Tarzan was so... so...

349
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,012
Brave.

350
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,839
Mmm! And muscular.

351
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:24,953
Whoo!

352
00:19:24,993 --> 00:19:27,514
You say something, Eleanor?
Aah!

353
00:19:27,553 --> 00:19:30,488
No, I didn't say-Oh, Jane!

354
00:19:34,433 --> 00:19:35,960
Aah!

355
00:19:36,001 --> 00:19:37,245
Uhh!

356
00:20:04,767 --> 00:20:06,360
Tarzan, no!

357
00:20:22,046 --> 00:20:23,453
- Ow!
- Yee-ouch!

358
00:20:35,804 --> 00:20:37,114
Jane, no!

359
00:20:37,149 --> 00:20:40,051
Use this vine. Go!

360
00:20:43,548 --> 00:20:44,693
JANE.. Uhh!

361
00:20:47,259 --> 00:20:48,438
Heh.

362
00:20:49,629 --> 00:20:50,772
Jane!

363
00:20:53,467 --> 00:20:54,613
Oh!

364
00:20:54,652 --> 00:20:55,993
Unh!

365
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,239
Go, Jane! You can do it!

366
00:21:08,282 --> 00:21:09,809
You're almost there!

367
00:21:41,209 --> 00:21:43,379
She's so lucky.

368
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,593
Oh, Jane, thank you
for a truly memorable visit.

369
00:21:48,631 --> 00:21:50,606
You lead a remarkable life.

370
00:21:50,647 --> 00:21:53,778
I envy you, Jane.
You have everything-

371
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:56,465
and I do mean everything.

372
00:21:56,503 --> 00:21:58,063
He doesn't have a brother,
does he?

373
00:21:58,102 --> 00:21:59,857
Or a cousin? I'm not choosy.

374
00:22:01,974 --> 00:22:06,447
We're going to miss you so much.

375
00:22:08,789 --> 00:22:11,889
Oh, come, now.
Show some decorum.

376
00:22:11,926 --> 00:22:13,617
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, Jane.

377
00:22:13,654 --> 00:22:16,109
Good-bye, Tarzan.
We'll miss you.

378
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:18,767
Bye-bye.
I'll miss you.

379
00:22:18,805 --> 00:22:21,390
I hope I see you soon.

380
00:22:21,428 --> 00:22:23,054
Jane...

381
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:25,809
do you miss London?

382
00:22:25,843 --> 00:22:27,982
Oh, well,
every now and again...

383
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,059
but my friends were right.

384
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:33,547
I have changed, and I like it.

385
00:22:33,587 --> 00:22:35,922
So, Mr. Fancypants...

386
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:37,483
you think you'd be up
for another round...

387
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:39,912
of treetop tag? You're it.

388
00:22:41,748 --> 00:22:44,398
Whee! Ha ha!

389
00:22:44,435 --> 00:22:47,631
Hello? Tarzan?

390
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:48,943
Anybody?

391
00:22:48,978 --> 00:22:51,247
I'm getting rather hungry,
you know.

392
00:22:51,282 --> 00:22:53,934
And so, Tarzan, Jane...

393
00:22:53,971 --> 00:22:56,905
and their valiant
elephant friend...

394
00:22:56,946 --> 00:23:00,776
lived happily ever after.

395
00:23:00,818 --> 00:23:02,028
Didn't they, Terk?

396
00:23:03,729 --> 00:23:05,998
Terk? Oh! Oh!

397
00:23:09,074 --> 00:23:12,684
Sorry, Terk.
You should've said something.

398
00:23:12,721 --> 00:23:14,347
I did.
You must not have heard me...

399
00:23:14,385 --> 00:23:15,695
through the two tons of butt!

400
00:23:16,784 --> 00:23:20,265
Anyway, Jane, maybe
a party ain't the best idea.

401
00:23:20,305 --> 00:23:23,915
Yes. Perhaps Tarzan
would be a bit uncomfortable.

402
00:23:23,952 --> 00:23:25,861
Maybe we'll just have
a simple exchange...

403
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,465
of gifts instead.

404
00:23:27,504 --> 00:23:28,650
Ooh!

405
00:23:28,688 --> 00:23:30,956
Well, what sort of gifts
do men give women...

406
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,651
in the civilized world?

407
00:23:32,688 --> 00:23:34,475
There are many possibilities.

408
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,453
Perhaps a box of candy...

409
00:23:36,495 --> 00:23:39,495
or maybe a dozen
long-stemmed roses...

410
00:23:39,535 --> 00:23:41,837
or, ooh, some rare gem.

411
00:23:41,872 --> 00:23:43,048
Yes. Like a...

412
00:23:43,086 --> 00:23:45,126
Like a diamond?

413
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:47,850
Yes, Terk.
Sometimes it's a diamond.

414
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:49,380
And do you remember
the last time...

415
00:23:49,422 --> 00:23:51,494
Tarzan tried
to get you a diamond?

416
00:23:51,533 --> 00:23:52,778
I do remember that.

417
00:23:52,814 --> 00:23:54,669
That is definitely
ringing a bell or two.

418
00:23:54,703 --> 00:23:57,320
I wasn't asking you.
I was asking her.

419
00:23:57,358 --> 00:24:00,259
Right. Sorry.
I'll be good. Right.

420
00:24:00,301 --> 00:24:03,368
Yes, I remember, Terk-
like it was yesterday.

421
00:24:20,428 --> 00:24:23,656
Watch yourself.
These are dangerous lands.

422
00:24:23,692 --> 00:24:26,343
Control yourself, Merkus.

423
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:29,064
We don't want to give the locals
the wrong impression.

424
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,165
Don't worry. I'll set 'em
right quick enough.

425
00:24:32,203 --> 00:24:36,425
Oh, save it for
the jungle beasts, would you?

426
00:24:36,459 --> 00:24:38,367
We have business here.

427
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:41,313
And why exactly
do you want to hire a guide?

428
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:44,703
Forget the guide.
I can handle this place.

429
00:24:44,746 --> 00:24:46,818
You'll have to forgive Merkus.

430
00:24:46,857 --> 00:24:49,924
He's full of
scientific curiosity.

431
00:24:49,963 --> 00:24:51,455
Sit.

432
00:24:51,497 --> 00:24:53,253
We are volcanologists...

433
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,719
who have come
to study the volcano...

434
00:24:54,762 --> 00:24:56,616
on the far side
of your jungle.

435
00:24:56,649 --> 00:24:58,438
Mm-hmm.

436
00:24:58,474 --> 00:25:01,985
There is only one man
with the skills to help you.

437
00:25:02,025 --> 00:25:04,391
R eally?
And who would that be?

438
00:25:04,424 --> 00:25:06,312
Ahem.

439
00:25:10,152 --> 00:25:11,909
His name is Tarzan.

440
00:25:11,945 --> 00:25:14,465
He knows the jungle better
than the animals themselves...

441
00:25:14,504 --> 00:25:17,853
but he won't be easy
to convince.

442
00:25:17,896 --> 00:25:21,539
I'll just let this
do the talking for me.

443
00:25:21,575 --> 00:25:24,958
I'm afraid Tarzan
doesn't speak that language.

444
00:25:24,999 --> 00:25:27,104
Nonsense.

445
00:25:27,143 --> 00:25:29,826
What kind of a man
has no interest in money?

446
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:32,644
MAN.. Stop that!
Unhand me! Uhh!

447
00:25:32,678 --> 00:25:34,172
You can't treat me like this.

448
00:25:34,214 --> 00:25:36,549
If you ever hunt an animal
in this jungle again...

449
00:25:36,582 --> 00:25:38,404
I will do far worse.

450
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:47,390
My word.
Who is that savage?

451
00:25:47,428 --> 00:25:50,147
That would be your guide.

452
00:25:53,221 --> 00:25:55,013
Mr. Tarzan!

453
00:25:55,047 --> 00:25:57,347
Mr. Tarzan, wait.

454
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,747
Allow me to introduce myself.

455
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,471
I am Johannes Niels...

456
00:26:01,509 --> 00:26:03,811
and this is
my associate Merkus.

457
00:26:05,509 --> 00:26:07,331
Yes. Well...

458
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:09,306
we've come to study
the volcano...

459
00:26:09,349 --> 00:26:11,203
on the other side
of your jungle...

460
00:26:11,235 --> 00:26:14,531
and we need a guide
to take us there.

461
00:26:14,563 --> 00:26:17,880
You're not here
to study anything.

462
00:26:17,924 --> 00:26:19,385
Wait!

463
00:26:19,427 --> 00:26:22,656
You found us out.

464
00:26:22,691 --> 00:26:25,080
The truth is,
we're going to the volcano...

465
00:26:25,123 --> 00:26:29,313
to look for... diamonds.

466
00:26:29,347 --> 00:26:32,030
What are... diamonds?

467
00:26:34,433 --> 00:26:35,841
Why, my dear fellow...

468
00:26:35,873 --> 00:26:38,590
you must get out
of the jungle more often.

469
00:26:39,777 --> 00:26:43,519
Diamonds are precious stones
of great value.

470
00:26:46,881 --> 00:26:48,605
Why?

471
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:50,103
Ooh. Well...

472
00:26:50,146 --> 00:26:53,887
women around the world prize
them more than anything else.

473
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,001
What's that man doing?

474
00:26:55,041 --> 00:26:56,829
It's traditional for a groom...

475
00:26:56,864 --> 00:27:00,212
to give his bride
a diamond ring.

476
00:27:00,256 --> 00:27:01,685
Is this done in England?

477
00:27:01,728 --> 00:27:05,525
NIELS.. Oh, but of course...
the bigger, the better.

478
00:27:05,568 --> 00:27:08,317
Two months of your salary
won't buy much.

479
00:27:08,351 --> 00:27:11,286
Uh... so, Tarzan...

480
00:27:11,327 --> 00:27:12,636
will you be our guide?

481
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:15,224
I'll think about it.

482
00:27:16,991 --> 00:27:18,268
Oh, I don't trust that one.

483
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:21,270
We don't need
to trust him, Merkus.

484
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:23,863
We just need to use him.

485
00:27:25,471 --> 00:27:27,641
JANE.. Why so quiet, hmm?

486
00:27:27,678 --> 00:27:29,848
You're dining with
the most fascinating woman...

487
00:27:29,885 --> 00:27:31,292
in the jungle.

488
00:27:31,326 --> 00:27:33,431
The only one, admittedly,
but still...

489
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:35,706
I was thinking about...

490
00:27:35,742 --> 00:27:38,872
That is,
I was wondering whether...

491
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:40,470
Yes?

492
00:27:40,509 --> 00:27:42,712
What are weddings like
back in England?

493
00:27:42,749 --> 00:27:46,361
Oh, well, beautiful,
of course.

494
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:48,568
The bride's
in white with lace...

495
00:27:48,605 --> 00:27:49,946
and a train so long...

496
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,468
it takes four flower girls
just to carry it.

497
00:27:52,509 --> 00:27:54,297
And the men
wear morning suits...

498
00:27:54,332 --> 00:27:56,371
and there's
music and dancing...

499
00:27:56,411 --> 00:27:58,648
and beautiful flowers
and wonderful food...

500
00:27:58,683 --> 00:28:00,952
and a gorgeous cake
and...

501
00:28:00,988 --> 00:28:02,133
And men give their brides rings?

502
00:28:02,171 --> 00:28:03,895
Diamond rings!

503
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,070
You should've seen the rock
my cousin Gwendolyn got...

504
00:28:06,107 --> 00:28:07,995
big as a strawberry.

505
00:28:08,027 --> 00:28:09,815
Of course, her husband
is landed gentry, but...

506
00:28:11,451 --> 00:28:13,272
Well, then again,
one English wedding...

507
00:28:13,306 --> 00:28:15,575
is really just like
another-not like ours.

508
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:19,832
Who else can say she had
a gorilla for a maid of honor?

509
00:28:19,866 --> 00:28:21,491
What's all this about, anyway?

510
00:28:21,529 --> 00:28:25,174
Nothing.
I was just wondering.

511
00:28:32,313 --> 00:28:34,931
Tarzan! Good morning.

512
00:28:34,968 --> 00:28:36,627
Jane, uh, good morning.

513
00:28:36,665 --> 00:28:38,607
I'm going... out.

514
00:28:38,648 --> 00:28:40,437
Right. So it appears.

515
00:28:40,472 --> 00:28:43,057
But I'll be back later.
Soon.

516
00:28:43,095 --> 00:28:45,168
Tonight or tomorrow or...

517
00:28:45,209 --> 00:28:46,453
Or soon.

518
00:28:55,926 --> 00:28:58,316
All right,
I'll take you to the volcano.

519
00:28:58,359 --> 00:28:59,537
Excellent.

520
00:28:59,576 --> 00:29:01,004
On one condition.

521
00:29:01,047 --> 00:29:02,291
Here it comes.

522
00:29:02,327 --> 00:29:04,215
I want a diamond for Jane.

523
00:29:04,247 --> 00:29:07,509
Oh. You drive a hard bargain.

524
00:29:07,543 --> 00:29:09,167
Well, all right.

525
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:11,727
One diamond, it is.

526
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:15,855
You sure you want to do this?

527
00:29:15,894 --> 00:29:19,406
Ohh. Anything for romance.

528
00:29:20,982 --> 00:29:22,836
Astounding.

529
00:29:22,869 --> 00:29:26,032
He's actually able to
communicate with that beast.

530
00:29:26,069 --> 00:29:29,964
They're probably planning to
cheat us out of the diamonds.

531
00:29:30,004 --> 00:29:32,525
I see right through that savage.

532
00:29:32,564 --> 00:29:35,214
You're exceptionally paranoid,
Merkus.

533
00:29:35,252 --> 00:29:39,026
Still, you'd best keep
a close watch on him.

534
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:43,022
Make way. Coming through.
Wide load.

535
00:29:43,059 --> 00:29:45,361
One side,
my little jungle friends.

536
00:29:45,395 --> 00:29:47,500
I'm... Whoa!

537
00:29:49,235 --> 00:29:51,820
Does he know them crates
is full of explosives?

538
00:29:51,858 --> 00:29:56,015
If it explodes,
at least we'll get the ivory.

539
00:29:57,299 --> 00:29:59,820
Oh, my, my, my, my.

540
00:29:59,859 --> 00:30:01,200
Fascinating.

541
00:30:01,235 --> 00:30:04,235
Reflexive closure
followed by release.

542
00:30:04,275 --> 00:30:06,162
Oh. Ha ha!

543
00:30:06,195 --> 00:30:09,161
Daddy, why do you think Tarzan
would hide something from me?

544
00:30:09,201 --> 00:30:11,590
Slight tingling, no pain...

545
00:30:11,634 --> 00:30:14,700
Oh! Oh!
Now, that smarts. Ho ho!

546
00:30:14,737 --> 00:30:18,031
When he went out this morning,
he acted very shifty...

547
00:30:18,065 --> 00:30:21,513
as if he were hiding something,
and he isn't back yet.

548
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:23,495
Tarzan, you say?

549
00:30:23,537 --> 00:30:25,741
He was on his way
to the trading post.

550
00:30:25,777 --> 00:30:28,711
Right, right, right.
Fun's over. Let go.

551
00:30:28,752 --> 00:30:30,791
The trading post?

552
00:30:30,832 --> 00:30:32,807
I think I'd best
get to the bottom of this.

553
00:30:32,848 --> 00:30:36,557
Yes, yes.
Right behind you, Jane.

554
00:30:44,975 --> 00:30:46,536
TARZAN..
Watch your step, Tantor.

555
00:30:52,238 --> 00:30:53,351
Aah!

556
00:30:56,334 --> 00:30:58,952
Crocodile?!

557
00:31:01,133 --> 00:31:03,021
- Aah!
- Aah!

558
00:31:07,727 --> 00:31:09,962
- Easy now.
- Nice crocodiles.

559
00:31:09,998 --> 00:31:11,885
- Aah!
- Aah!

560
00:31:28,812 --> 00:31:31,811
Right! Up the tree!

561
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,586
Aah!

562
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:59,624
Whew. We're safe.

563
00:31:59,659 --> 00:32:02,341
As long as the tree holds out.

564
00:32:05,993 --> 00:32:09,789
Ah, Jane.
How lovely to see you.

565
00:32:09,832 --> 00:32:11,807
Uhh! Ahh.

566
00:32:11,848 --> 00:32:15,296
Just need a breath or so.
One moment.

567
00:32:15,336 --> 00:32:17,159
To what do I owe the honor?

568
00:32:17,193 --> 00:32:19,396
Do you know where Tarzan went?

569
00:32:19,432 --> 00:32:22,945
Ohh! Always Tarzan.

570
00:32:22,984 --> 00:32:26,332
Perhaps sometime
you'll come by just to see me?

571
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:28,896
Perhaps.
Now, about Tarzan...

572
00:32:28,935 --> 00:32:31,619
He's guiding two men to
the volcano across the jungle.

573
00:32:31,655 --> 00:32:33,149
What? Whatever for?

574
00:32:33,191 --> 00:32:34,652
None of my business...

575
00:32:34,694 --> 00:32:38,273
but they were
rather unsavory characters.

576
00:32:38,312 --> 00:32:39,871
Goodness.
Did you warn Tarzan?

577
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:44,165
No. I don't make it a practice
to offend paying customers.

578
00:32:44,197 --> 00:32:48,191
You know, if something
were to happen to Tarzan...

579
00:32:48,229 --> 00:32:51,329
I would hope this is a shoulder
you could cry on.

580
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:56,253
Daddy, we must get
to Tarzan straightaway.

581
00:33:03,205 --> 00:33:04,928
Raah!

582
00:33:06,629 --> 00:33:09,694
You can come down now.

583
00:33:09,732 --> 00:33:11,259
Thank you.

584
00:33:11,301 --> 00:33:13,210
Waah!

585
00:33:13,252 --> 00:33:14,746
We're almost at the volcano.

586
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:19,231
Ha ha ha! At last.

587
00:33:19,268 --> 00:33:23,458
NIELS.. I can practically
smell the diamonds already.

588
00:33:26,307 --> 00:33:28,096
It's time, jungle man.

589
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:33,401
I'm turning on you
before you turn on us.

590
00:33:33,442 --> 00:33:35,330
What are you doing?

591
00:33:35,363 --> 00:33:37,021
Striking first.

592
00:33:37,058 --> 00:33:39,262
I said keep an eye on him.

593
00:33:39,298 --> 00:33:40,957
There's still
a lot of digging to do.

594
00:33:40,994 --> 00:33:44,955
Unless you want to do all of it,
put that away.

595
00:33:44,994 --> 00:33:46,303
But I...

596
00:33:46,337 --> 00:33:50,298
If and when
we find the diamonds...

597
00:33:50,337 --> 00:33:55,193
then you may do as you will
with Mr. Tarzan.

598
00:33:57,729 --> 00:33:59,769
All right,
let me get this straight.

599
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:02,591
Tantor and Tarzan
are guiding some tough guys...

600
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:04,152
to the volcano
across the jungle...

601
00:34:04,193 --> 00:34:05,883
but he didn't
tell you about it?

602
00:34:05,921 --> 00:34:07,481
Precisely.

603
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,788
I understand not telling you...

604
00:34:09,823 --> 00:34:11,416
but not telling me?

605
00:34:11,456 --> 00:34:13,560
What are they thinking?

606
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:19,960
Almost ready.

607
00:34:19,999 --> 00:34:22,300
What does that thing do?

608
00:34:27,935 --> 00:34:29,561
You mean... they were...

609
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,054
and I... Ohh.

610
00:34:32,095 --> 00:34:33,655
Ow!

611
00:34:33,694 --> 00:34:36,280
It's going
to take more than that...

612
00:34:36,318 --> 00:34:38,937
to get my diamonds. Uhh!

613
00:34:38,974 --> 00:34:41,820
But why would Tarzan
be so secretive?

614
00:34:41,853 --> 00:34:44,537
We've always been entirely
open with one another.

615
00:34:44,574 --> 00:34:46,035
Hey, it's Tarzan, all right?

616
00:34:46,077 --> 00:34:48,084
I'm sure he had a good reason.

617
00:34:48,124 --> 00:34:50,612
Perhaps he couldn't tell you.

618
00:34:50,652 --> 00:34:52,179
Whatever do you mean, Daddy?

619
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,814
Sworn to silence.

620
00:34:53,853 --> 00:34:55,642
Maybe those chaps
have something on him.

621
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:58,459
Monsieur Dumont said
they'd never met Tarzan before.

622
00:34:58,492 --> 00:35:02,354
Very well, then.
Why was he being so cagey?

623
00:35:02,396 --> 00:35:03,891
Unless, of course, he was...

624
00:35:03,932 --> 00:35:06,298
Oh, no, no, no.
Preposterous. Heh heh.

625
00:35:06,332 --> 00:35:07,738
Or is it?

626
00:35:07,771 --> 00:35:09,048
What, Daddy?

627
00:35:09,084 --> 00:35:11,090
Tarzan is...

628
00:35:11,132 --> 00:35:12,441
A spy?

629
00:35:12,476 --> 00:35:15,475
It all fits. The implausible
background story.

630
00:35:15,515 --> 00:35:18,361
I mean, raised by apes?
Really.

631
00:35:18,394 --> 00:35:19,824
Hey, come on.

632
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:23,795
I was there.
I saw the apes, all right?

633
00:35:23,834 --> 00:35:26,386
But on the outside chance...

634
00:35:26,426 --> 00:35:28,433
who do you
think he's spying for?

635
00:35:28,474 --> 00:35:32,304
Oh, please. There's nobody
to spy on in the jungle.

636
00:35:32,346 --> 00:35:35,476
That's what makes it
so deviously clever.

637
00:35:35,513 --> 00:35:36,790
Aah!

638
00:35:36,825 --> 00:35:37,970
Ohh!

639
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:50,200
Mr. Niels...

640
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:52,785
might this be
what I think it is?

641
00:35:52,824 --> 00:35:55,378
Yes. We must be close.

642
00:35:55,416 --> 00:35:57,456
Keep digging.

643
00:36:14,358 --> 00:36:17,555
At the risk of sounding
shamelessly cliche...

644
00:36:17,591 --> 00:36:20,557
we are rich!

645
00:36:20,598 --> 00:36:22,452
Sparkly rocks?

646
00:36:22,486 --> 00:36:24,853
That's what
all the shouting's about?

647
00:36:24,886 --> 00:36:28,017
Mm-hmm. Women wear
these rocks on their fingers.

648
00:36:28,053 --> 00:36:30,867
And they call us uncivilized.

649
00:36:40,437 --> 00:36:41,581
Ahh.

650
00:36:44,436 --> 00:36:46,127
This way, Janey.

651
00:36:46,164 --> 00:36:47,659
TANTOR.. Terk!

652
00:36:47,701 --> 00:36:48,944
What are you doing here?

653
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,387
Jane and the professor...

654
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,841
think those guys with Tarzan
are bad news.

655
00:36:52,883 --> 00:36:54,345
I tagged along to help out.

656
00:36:54,388 --> 00:36:55,882
What kind of bad news?

657
00:36:55,924 --> 00:36:57,680
Oh, real bad-

658
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:00,715
the worst,
the ultimate pinnacle...

659
00:37:00,756 --> 00:37:02,511
Hey, are those termites?

660
00:37:05,362 --> 00:37:09,193
Now, which one of these
will Jane like?

661
00:37:09,235 --> 00:37:10,990
MERKUS..
I don't think so, mate.

662
00:37:11,027 --> 00:37:14,604
You're not
stealing my diamonds.

663
00:37:14,641 --> 00:37:15,951
I am not a thief.

664
00:37:15,986 --> 00:37:20,426
Maybe, maybe not,
but better safe than sorry.

665
00:37:20,466 --> 00:37:22,920
- No!
- Ohh!

666
00:37:24,626 --> 00:37:27,822
- Tarzan!
- Or whoever you really are.

667
00:37:38,481 --> 00:37:40,040
Unh! Uhh!

668
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:42,153
Stop him!

669
00:37:42,192 --> 00:37:44,395
Not to worry.
I planned for this.

670
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,021
Ha ha ha!
I showed him, eh? Eh?

671
00:37:58,063 --> 00:38:00,877
Showed him?
You blew the whole place up!

672
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:03,147
Now we'll never get
the rest of the diamonds.

673
00:38:04,271 --> 00:38:07,140
Perhaps we should
discuss this elsewhere.

674
00:38:07,182 --> 00:38:09,070
Like back on the boat?

675
00:38:11,118 --> 00:38:12,842
Hmm. Sounds like thunder.

676
00:38:12,879 --> 00:38:15,595
Sorry. I got to lay off
those fuzzy leaves.

677
00:38:18,509 --> 00:38:20,997
That came from the volcano!

678
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,907
Uhh! Uhh!

679
00:38:23,949 --> 00:38:26,371
We certainly won't be
getting out the way we came in.

680
00:38:29,004 --> 00:38:32,004
And there's more bad news,
I'm afraid.

681
00:38:33,004 --> 00:38:35,143
- The ground is on fire.
- Precisely.

682
00:38:35,181 --> 00:38:38,563
This volcano is becoming
more active by the minute.

683
00:38:45,548 --> 00:38:47,882
Oh! Oh! Ohh!

684
00:38:55,242 --> 00:38:57,697
We must get to higher ground.

685
00:38:58,986 --> 00:39:00,481
There's no way out.

686
00:39:00,523 --> 00:39:03,043
Hmm. I wonder if...

687
00:39:03,082 --> 00:39:05,351
Oh, no, no, no.
It's quite ridiculous.

688
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:06,695
What is it, Daddy?

689
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:10,504
Well, if the magma dome
is directly under us...

690
00:39:10,536 --> 00:39:14,246
then perhaps the volcano's
hollow core is above.

691
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,931
Of course, it's unlikely
that the top of the cave...

692
00:39:16,969 --> 00:39:18,310
is thin enough
to break through...

693
00:39:18,345 --> 00:39:21,028
even if there were a way
to get up there. Oh.

694
00:39:26,313 --> 00:39:28,898
Good show, Tarzan. Ha ha!

695
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,537
Please be careful.

696
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,540
What do you see?

697
00:39:45,575 --> 00:39:47,136
The professor was right.

698
00:39:47,175 --> 00:39:49,148
It stands to reason.

699
00:39:52,263 --> 00:39:55,109
Hold on tight, Daddy.

700
00:39:59,398 --> 00:40:00,860
Hurry!

701
00:40:02,021 --> 00:40:03,363
Fascinating.

702
00:40:03,397 --> 00:40:06,114
If only we could study
the magma properly.

703
00:40:06,149 --> 00:40:08,867
- Perhaps some other time, Daddy.
- Point well taken.

704
00:40:23,235 --> 00:40:24,894
MERKUS..
The trading post is this way.

705
00:40:24,932 --> 00:40:26,110
I think.

706
00:40:26,149 --> 00:40:29,595
That jungle man would
come in handy right about now.

707
00:40:30,757 --> 00:40:33,276
I told you. I can handle it.

708
00:40:33,315 --> 00:40:34,494
Oh!

709
00:40:36,386 --> 00:40:41,056
Is this what
you call handling it?

710
00:40:41,091 --> 00:40:42,400
Run!

711
00:40:48,514 --> 00:40:51,034
We'll just
have to wait them out.

712
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:54,935
They'll get bored... eventually.

713
00:40:54,978 --> 00:40:58,044
- Ohh!
- Daddy!

714
00:41:00,482 --> 00:41:02,718
Oh, thank you, my boy.

715
00:41:02,753 --> 00:41:05,752
Although, at this point,
I fear it's for naught.

716
00:41:11,744 --> 00:41:14,165
Tarzan?
What on earth are you doing?

717
00:41:14,207 --> 00:41:16,542
Grab hold of me. Hurry.

718
00:41:16,576 --> 00:41:18,170
But we want to go up!

719
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:20,574
Don't worry. We will.

720
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,530
Is this possible?

721
00:41:29,567 --> 00:41:32,883
Oh! Who cares?
As long as it's working.

722
00:41:32,927 --> 00:41:34,301
Ha ha ha ha!

723
00:41:36,343 --> 00:41:38,678
What now?

724
00:41:38,711 --> 00:41:39,856
Aah!

725
00:41:41,112 --> 00:41:43,795
Aah!

726
00:41:59,063 --> 00:42:00,973
- Aah!
- Aah!

727
00:42:12,149 --> 00:42:14,865
Aah!

728
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,362
Oh! Sizzling hot.

729
00:42:16,405 --> 00:42:18,063
Far too broiling
for comfort.

730
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:20,272
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Ooh! Ah! Ah! Oh!

731
00:42:20,309 --> 00:42:21,453
Ah! Ooh! Ah!

732
00:42:28,372 --> 00:42:32,649
Aah! Invigorating!
Extraordinary! Ha ha!

733
00:42:34,708 --> 00:42:36,681
NIELS.. There, you see?

734
00:42:36,724 --> 00:42:38,349
Now we can get-

735
00:42:41,779 --> 00:42:44,266
Up! Get up!

736
00:42:49,426 --> 00:42:53,135
Tarzan! You're alive.

737
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:56,586
I hope you're not angry about
that mishap in the cavern.

738
00:42:57,873 --> 00:42:59,499
The diamonds!

739
00:42:59,538 --> 00:43:01,197
No, no, no! Go back!

740
00:43:01,234 --> 00:43:03,470
You want to go back into that?

741
00:43:08,017 --> 00:43:10,602
Please, let me explain.

742
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,456
This is all just
a big misunderstanding.

743
00:43:13,489 --> 00:43:15,823
We're volcanologists.

744
00:43:15,857 --> 00:43:18,638
You should've let me shoot him
while we had the chance!

745
00:43:18,672 --> 00:43:22,218
You can explain that
to the authorities as well.

746
00:43:22,257 --> 00:43:25,900
In the end,
justice was served...

747
00:43:25,935 --> 00:43:29,645
jungle justice.

748
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:30,662
That's a very nice story...

749
00:43:30,704 --> 00:43:32,809
but I don't
see what it has to do...

750
00:43:32,847 --> 00:43:34,123
with our anniversary.

751
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:36,263
Well, Tarzan felt bad
when he thought...

752
00:43:36,302 --> 00:43:37,929
he was supposed
to give you a diamond...

753
00:43:37,967 --> 00:43:39,877
and that was just a regular day.

754
00:43:39,919 --> 00:43:43,301
So, imagine how
he's going to feel...

755
00:43:43,343 --> 00:43:45,578
When I step in with
an anniversary present...

756
00:43:45,615 --> 00:43:47,240
and he has nothing for me.

757
00:43:47,278 --> 00:43:51,053
He'll be crushed.

758
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:52,908
- Aah!
- Good heavens!

759
00:43:52,941 --> 00:43:54,534
- Wow! Incoming!
- Hit the deck!

760
00:43:54,574 --> 00:43:56,265
Uhh!

761
00:43:56,302 --> 00:43:58,985
Daddy? Is that you?

762
00:43:59,021 --> 00:44:00,712
Uhh.

763
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:04,044
What's left of me, Janey, dear.

764
00:44:04,077 --> 00:44:05,354
What happened?

765
00:44:05,389 --> 00:44:07,974
Well, I was conducting
a scientific experiment...

766
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:10,379
to determine if there is
a combustible reaction...

767
00:44:10,412 --> 00:44:11,973
between sodium dichloronate...

768
00:44:12,012 --> 00:44:13,955
and bicarbonate of nitrate.

769
00:44:13,997 --> 00:44:16,265
I take it the answer is yes.

770
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:19,463
You bet your sweet boopie
it's yes!

771
00:44:19,499 --> 00:44:22,184
Anyway,
what brings you all here?

772
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:24,805
Tarzan and I have been
married a year...

773
00:44:24,843 --> 00:44:26,916
so we were just discussing
what I should do...

774
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:28,482
to mark the occasion.

775
00:44:28,523 --> 00:44:30,377
Terk and Tantor
have already rejected...

776
00:44:30,411 --> 00:44:31,872
my previous ideas.

777
00:44:31,914 --> 00:44:34,882
Well, you know,
a party would make him feel bad.

778
00:44:34,924 --> 00:44:37,956
And a gift would make him
feel even worse.

779
00:44:37,995 --> 00:44:39,075
All right, then.

780
00:44:39,115 --> 00:44:41,154
Maybe we could,
I don't know...

781
00:44:41,193 --> 00:44:43,135
dance beneath the moonlight?

782
00:44:43,178 --> 00:44:45,479
Ah, splendid idea, Janey.

783
00:44:45,514 --> 00:44:47,040
You can do a nice waltz.

784
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,815
Or a tango.

785
00:44:53,896 --> 00:44:56,865
Maybe even a fox trot.

786
00:44:56,905 --> 00:44:58,661
# Rum bum, rum bum bum bum #

787
00:44:58,697 --> 00:45:01,567
Uh, guys?
Tarzan and dancing?

788
00:45:01,608 --> 00:45:03,812
You remember
the last time he danced?

789
00:45:03,848 --> 00:45:05,671
Oh, yes.

790
00:45:05,705 --> 00:45:08,453
That wasn't
a happy occasion at all.

791
00:45:45,412 --> 00:45:46,657
Blast!

792
00:45:58,725 --> 00:46:00,131
Aah!

793
00:46:09,155 --> 00:46:11,490
Sorry, Nigel, old boy.

794
00:46:18,084 --> 00:46:22,590
And now, Jane Porter,
I turn my attention to you.

795
00:46:23,553 --> 00:46:24,831
Connect antenna.

796
00:46:24,866 --> 00:46:26,360
Right-o. Next.

797
00:46:26,403 --> 00:46:28,474
Insert germanium diode "A"...

798
00:46:28,513 --> 00:46:30,936
into receiver base "B."

799
00:46:30,978 --> 00:46:32,089
Germanium...

800
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:33,788
Germanium diode?

801
00:46:33,826 --> 00:46:35,931
Absurd. What would I be
doing with one of those...

802
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:38,141
in the jungle?

803
00:46:38,177 --> 00:46:39,640
But, I dare say...

804
00:46:39,682 --> 00:46:42,747
I can jerry-rig
this waffle iron.

805
00:46:42,785 --> 00:46:44,640
Oh, good heavens.
Forgot breakfast again.

806
00:46:44,672 --> 00:46:46,047
What are you doing, Professor?

807
00:46:46,081 --> 00:46:48,929
Oh, yes.
I'm building a radio, dear boy...

808
00:46:48,961 --> 00:46:50,816
a two-way radio.

809
00:46:50,848 --> 00:46:52,856
Against my better judgment
I ask...

810
00:46:52,897 --> 00:46:54,522
what's a radio?

811
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:56,666
It's a device
that allows us to communicate...

812
00:46:56,704 --> 00:46:58,361
with people very far away.

813
00:46:58,399 --> 00:47:00,888
- Like people in England?
- I should hope so.

814
00:47:00,929 --> 00:47:03,830
Love to see who's winning
the test matches in cricket.

815
00:47:03,871 --> 00:47:07,449
Now, I just need
one more wire for the tuner.

816
00:47:07,488 --> 00:47:09,495
It was here somewhere before.

817
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:11,257
I don't... Oh, dear.

818
00:47:11,294 --> 00:47:13,083
I appear to be all out.

819
00:47:13,118 --> 00:47:15,125
But this might do the trick.

820
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:19,094
Ow! I thought humans were big
on "Please" and "Thank you. "

821
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:24,212
Ha ha ha ha!

822
00:47:24,253 --> 00:47:26,228
Ah, there, you see?

823
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:28,058
# Hem hem hum ha ha #

824
00:47:28,093 --> 00:47:29,588
Oh, this is a favorite.

825
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:31,540
# Hem lum bum bum bum #

826
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:33,240
# Lem pum rum pum #

827
00:47:33,277 --> 00:47:35,546
Oh, Daddy! Strauss!

828
00:47:35,582 --> 00:47:36,955
How delightful.

829
00:47:36,988 --> 00:47:38,963
# Da da da da dum #

830
00:47:39,005 --> 00:47:40,662
# Dum dum, dum dum #

831
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:42,675
# Da da da da dum,
dum dum... #

832
00:47:42,717 --> 00:47:45,400
Come, Tarzan, dance with me.

833
00:47:49,755 --> 00:47:52,144
Ohh! Ha ha!

834
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:55,705
Hmm. Looks like
I'll need another hair.

835
00:48:00,443 --> 00:48:02,832
Ha ha ha ha!

836
00:48:02,875 --> 00:48:05,331
That was very nice, Tarzan...

837
00:48:05,371 --> 00:48:07,607
but not quite a waltz.

838
00:48:07,643 --> 00:48:08,787
What is that?

839
00:48:08,827 --> 00:48:11,543
It's a three-step
ballroom dance in triple meter.

840
00:48:11,577 --> 00:48:13,171
No. What is that?

841
00:48:15,546 --> 00:48:16,691
Duck!

842
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:22,518
Big duck.

843
00:48:22,554 --> 00:48:25,237
It's an aeroplane.
I think it's in trouble.

844
00:48:25,273 --> 00:48:27,030
It's headed for the river.

845
00:48:28,664 --> 00:48:29,647
Oh, dear.

846
00:48:29,689 --> 00:48:31,990
Perhaps I can pick up
the pilot on my radio.

847
00:48:44,216 --> 00:48:45,906
Are you all right?

848
00:48:45,944 --> 00:48:48,048
Unhand me, sir.

849
00:48:48,089 --> 00:48:50,292
I'm an officer
in Her Majesty's service.

850
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:52,629
I thought you might need help.

851
00:48:52,664 --> 00:48:54,288
My good fellow...

852
00:48:54,326 --> 00:48:56,399
I have yet to meet
the trouble I cannot handle.

853
00:48:56,439 --> 00:48:58,927
Bobby? Bobby Canler.

854
00:48:58,967 --> 00:49:01,106
I can't believe it's you!

855
00:49:01,143 --> 00:49:03,761
Ha ha ha! Brainy Janey.

856
00:49:03,799 --> 00:49:05,042
Surprised to see me?

857
00:49:05,078 --> 00:49:07,248
Ha ha ha! Absolutely.

858
00:49:09,462 --> 00:49:10,706
What'd I miss?

859
00:49:10,741 --> 00:49:14,125
The beginnings of
a very juicy love triangle.

860
00:49:14,166 --> 00:49:17,198
Oh, sweet.
This could get good.

861
00:49:17,238 --> 00:49:18,351
What ever are you doing here?

862
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:21,172
Oh, you know,
on a mission for the queen.

863
00:49:21,205 --> 00:49:23,245
But she was good enough
to give me a few days off...

864
00:49:23,286 --> 00:49:25,489
so I thought I'd pop down
and look you up.

865
00:49:25,525 --> 00:49:26,933
Oh, I'm so glad you did.

866
00:49:26,965 --> 00:49:28,524
How ever did you find me?

867
00:49:28,564 --> 00:49:30,604
My dear, your friend Hazel...

868
00:49:30,644 --> 00:49:32,782
is the biggest gossip
on the British isles.

869
00:49:32,819 --> 00:49:34,762
I think all of London
knows you're here.

870
00:49:34,804 --> 00:49:36,713
I'm Tarzan, Jane's husband.

871
00:49:36,755 --> 00:49:38,992
Oh, I'm sorry, Tarzan.

872
00:49:39,027 --> 00:49:40,402
This is Robert Canler.

873
00:49:40,436 --> 00:49:42,410
We practically grew up together.

874
00:49:42,452 --> 00:49:44,340
Robert, this is Tarzan.

875
00:49:44,372 --> 00:49:47,405
Ah, yes.
The chap who came to my rescue.

876
00:49:47,443 --> 00:49:49,996
Sir,
you have deprived England...

877
00:49:50,034 --> 00:49:51,725
of the finest woman
in the Empire.

878
00:49:51,763 --> 00:49:53,704
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

879
00:49:53,746 --> 00:49:55,885
Now leave.

880
00:49:55,923 --> 00:49:58,923
Tarzan!
Where are your manners?

881
00:49:58,963 --> 00:49:59,977
I don't trust him.

882
00:50:00,018 --> 00:50:01,426
When I look in his eyes...

883
00:50:01,458 --> 00:50:03,017
it's like
Sabor is looking back.

884
00:50:03,058 --> 00:50:05,033
Who the devil is Sabor?

885
00:50:05,074 --> 00:50:07,943
Tarzan,
you're being ridiculous.

886
00:50:07,986 --> 00:50:09,775
I've known Bobby
since I was five.

887
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:11,369
He's my oldest friend.

888
00:50:11,408 --> 00:50:12,653
FATHER.. Help!

889
00:50:12,689 --> 00:50:14,217
Fire.

890
00:50:14,258 --> 00:50:15,434
Daddy!

891
00:50:17,872 --> 00:50:21,287
Oh, it was just getting good.

892
00:50:29,552 --> 00:50:31,375
Oh! Aah!

893
00:50:31,409 --> 00:50:33,033
Help!

894
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:34,217
Jane!

895
00:50:35,184 --> 00:50:40,203
Aah!

896
00:50:41,742 --> 00:50:43,598
Shall we leave the flying to me?

897
00:50:50,639 --> 00:50:52,908
Daddy! Are you in there?

898
00:50:52,943 --> 00:50:55,876
Yes, yes, yes.
My latest attempt at radio...

899
00:50:55,918 --> 00:50:58,950
has had some
rather incendiary results.

900
00:51:19,149 --> 00:51:20,872
Sorry to steal your fire,
old boy...

901
00:51:20,909 --> 00:51:23,014
but it was beginning
to look a bit nasty.

902
00:51:23,052 --> 00:51:25,419
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

903
00:51:28,555 --> 00:51:30,464
I'm afraid your radio...

904
00:51:30,508 --> 00:51:33,574
will need just a bit
of retuning, Professor.

905
00:51:33,611 --> 00:51:34,952
Yes, quite so.

906
00:51:34,987 --> 00:51:38,216
Do I know you from somewhere?

907
00:51:38,251 --> 00:51:39,593
No, no, no. Don't tell me.

908
00:51:39,626 --> 00:51:41,830
You're my cardiologist
in Khartoum.

909
00:51:41,866 --> 00:51:42,794
No.

910
00:51:42,827 --> 00:51:44,932
- The allergist in Algeria?
- No.

911
00:51:44,971 --> 00:51:47,818
The urologist in the Urals?

912
00:51:47,851 --> 00:51:51,014
He was our next-door neighbor
in Knightsbrige, Daddy.

913
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:52,675
You remember Robert Canler.

914
00:51:52,714 --> 00:51:55,015
Little Bobby Canler!

915
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:56,642
Why, of course.

916
00:51:56,682 --> 00:51:58,950
All grown up now, I see, what?

917
00:51:58,985 --> 00:52:00,807
Splendid to see you, dear boy.

918
00:52:00,841 --> 00:52:02,750
Say, you wouldn't
by chance know...

919
00:52:02,793 --> 00:52:04,768
who's winning the test matches
in cricket, would you?

920
00:52:04,809 --> 00:52:07,525
England over Australia
by eight wickets.

921
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:10,659
Oh, bully.
Spot on. Good for them.

922
00:52:10,697 --> 00:52:13,413
Bobby, I simply
don't know how to thank you.

923
00:52:13,448 --> 00:52:14,910
Well, it was a long flight...

924
00:52:14,953 --> 00:52:17,341
and a spot of tea
would do wonders.

925
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:19,685
Oh, absolutely.
Coming, Tarzan?

926
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,305
No. He's a bad man, Jane.

927
00:52:22,344 --> 00:52:24,710
My, my.
Look who's jealous.

928
00:52:24,742 --> 00:52:27,133
I'm not jealous.
I just don't trust him.

929
00:52:27,176 --> 00:52:29,248
You don't trust Robert?
Very well.

930
00:52:29,287 --> 00:52:31,042
You certainly trust me,
don't you?

931
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:32,639
Well... yes.

932
00:52:32,678 --> 00:52:33,824
Then that should be enough.

933
00:52:33,863 --> 00:52:37,178
Please join us when
you're in a more civilized mood.

934
00:52:41,669 --> 00:52:44,899
I apologize for Tarzan.
He's not usually like that.

935
00:52:44,935 --> 00:52:47,454
Oh, I suppose
he's feeling threatened.

936
00:52:47,494 --> 00:52:49,664
Where is it?

937
00:52:49,701 --> 00:52:52,254
As if there could be
anything between us.

938
00:52:52,293 --> 00:52:54,944
You're practically
a brother to me.

939
00:52:54,982 --> 00:52:58,242
Yes, yes.
Quite right, Jane.

940
00:52:58,277 --> 00:52:59,423
Where is it?

941
00:53:00,805 --> 00:53:01,733
Good heavens!

942
00:53:04,997 --> 00:53:07,647
Robert, are you snooping?

943
00:53:07,683 --> 00:53:09,374
Um, yes.

944
00:53:09,412 --> 00:53:12,129
Caught me red-handed,
I'm afraid.

945
00:53:13,156 --> 00:53:15,773
Jane, do you recall
a small music box...

946
00:53:15,812 --> 00:53:18,081
I gave you
just before you left London?

947
00:53:18,115 --> 00:53:21,279
I believe so.
Porcelain, wasn't it?

948
00:53:21,316 --> 00:53:22,657
That's the one.

949
00:53:22,691 --> 00:53:25,506
You don't happen
to still have it, do you?

950
00:53:25,539 --> 00:53:26,749
Well, I might.

951
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:29,437
To tell you the truth,
I'm not quite sure.

952
00:53:29,475 --> 00:53:31,614
It was my mother's, you see...

953
00:53:31,651 --> 00:53:34,520
and, well,
there's someone back home...

954
00:53:34,562 --> 00:53:36,318
I'd very much like
to give it to.

955
00:53:36,355 --> 00:53:39,518
I'd best have a look, then,
shouldn't I?

956
00:53:39,554 --> 00:53:40,799
Perfect.

957
00:53:40,834 --> 00:53:43,070
Thank you so much, Jane.

958
00:53:44,514 --> 00:53:45,941
Ha. Right.

959
00:53:45,984 --> 00:53:49,182
Now all I need
is that bit of wire.

960
00:53:49,217 --> 00:53:52,664
Perhaps a bit of
nice wiry elephant hair...

961
00:53:52,704 --> 00:53:53,883
would do the trick.

962
00:53:53,921 --> 00:53:58,198
Don't mind me. I just need
to borrow a strand or two.

963
00:53:58,241 --> 00:54:01,503
Stop! I have
sensitive hair follicles.

964
00:54:01,537 --> 00:54:03,675
Come, now.
In the name of science.

965
00:54:03,712 --> 00:54:05,370
No, no, no, no, no!

966
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:06,815
Tantor! Come back!

967
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:08,855
The cricket match
is about to start.

968
00:54:08,896 --> 00:54:10,751
Let's go over this
one more time.

969
00:54:10,784 --> 00:54:12,888
You didn't go with them
because...

970
00:54:12,927 --> 00:54:16,188
I don't like tea,
and I don't like Canler.

971
00:54:16,223 --> 00:54:18,907
- And you're jealous.
- I am not.

972
00:54:18,944 --> 00:54:21,812
Right.
Why would you be jealous?

973
00:54:21,854 --> 00:54:24,123
I mean,
sure, Canler's dashing...

974
00:54:24,158 --> 00:54:25,947
and cultured and well-groomed.

975
00:54:25,983 --> 00:54:28,088
In other words,
everything you're not.

976
00:54:28,127 --> 00:54:31,421
So why would you even
consider being jealous?

977
00:54:31,453 --> 00:54:33,395
Maybe you're right.

978
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:35,194
I thought
there was something else...

979
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,204
but maybe I am just jealous.

980
00:54:37,245 --> 00:54:39,482
Tarzan, Jane loves you.

981
00:54:39,518 --> 00:54:40,947
And you should know by now...

982
00:54:40,990 --> 00:54:43,989
that ain't ever going to
change... ever.

983
00:54:44,029 --> 00:54:46,362
You're right, Terk.
Thanks.

984
00:54:47,709 --> 00:54:48,986
Humans.

985
00:54:49,022 --> 00:54:51,836
They make this relationship
stuff so complicated.

986
00:54:53,341 --> 00:54:55,250
Ah. Here it is.

987
00:54:58,013 --> 00:55:00,249
Excellent. Thank you, Jane.

988
00:55:00,284 --> 00:55:01,364
Don't thank me yet.

989
00:55:01,404 --> 00:55:03,739
We'd better make sure
it still works.

990
00:55:05,307 --> 00:55:07,859
Oh, this takes me right back.

991
00:55:07,899 --> 00:55:10,004
Robert, do you remember
the dance classes...

992
00:55:10,043 --> 00:55:11,157
that we took as children?

993
00:55:11,196 --> 00:55:13,650
Ah, yes.
And as I recall...

994
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:16,340
you had two left feet.

995
00:55:16,378 --> 00:55:17,655
I'll have you know...

996
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:19,665
I've become quite
an accomplished dancer.

997
00:55:19,707 --> 00:55:24,375
I'm sure you've picked up
a few steps from the gorillas.

998
00:55:24,409 --> 00:55:28,272
Sir,
prepare to eat your words.

999
00:55:35,449 --> 00:55:37,336
- Here it comes.
- Whoo!

1000
00:55:39,289 --> 00:55:40,534
Tarzan?

1001
00:55:45,433 --> 00:55:47,799
Ohh. Oh, dear.

1002
00:55:47,833 --> 00:55:49,557
Robert, I'm afraid
Tarzan has gotten...

1003
00:55:49,593 --> 00:55:51,731
a dreadfully wrong idea
about us.

1004
00:55:51,768 --> 00:55:53,460
Terribly sorry, Jane.

1005
00:55:53,496 --> 00:55:57,205
Perhaps I should just take
my music box and ship off.

1006
00:55:57,239 --> 00:55:58,450
Under the circumstances...

1007
00:55:58,487 --> 00:56:00,692
I do think
that that would be best.

1008
00:56:00,727 --> 00:56:03,891
I'm sorry that you came
all the way here only to...

1009
00:56:08,727 --> 00:56:09,904
Well, what's all this?

1010
00:56:09,943 --> 00:56:13,968
Robert, you're not
some kind of secret agent...

1011
00:56:14,006 --> 00:56:15,501
are you?

1012
00:56:15,543 --> 00:56:19,187
Actually, Jane,
it's more like a double agent.

1013
00:56:19,222 --> 00:56:22,004
Terribly sorry you stumbled
across my code machine.

1014
00:56:22,038 --> 00:56:23,566
Code machine?

1015
00:56:23,606 --> 00:56:26,387
A British code machine?

1016
00:56:26,422 --> 00:56:29,006
Quite. And the chaps
on the other side...

1017
00:56:29,045 --> 00:56:30,933
are willing
to pay handsomely for it.

1018
00:56:30,965 --> 00:56:33,004
Then why did you give it to me?

1019
00:56:33,045 --> 00:56:34,289
Ah. Heh.

1020
00:56:34,325 --> 00:56:36,464
British intelligence
was hot on my trail...

1021
00:56:36,501 --> 00:56:38,257
so as you were
leaving the country...

1022
00:56:38,293 --> 00:56:40,366
I slipped it to you
for safekeeping.

1023
00:56:40,405 --> 00:56:43,339
Of course, I never expected you
to stay in Africa.

1024
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:47,024
You're betraying England!
How could you?

1025
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:51,337
Is it too lowbrow
to say I did it for the money?

1026
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:53,966
Perhaps.
Is it too highbrow to say...

1027
00:56:54,004 --> 00:56:55,564
"God save the Queen"?

1028
00:56:58,132 --> 00:56:59,275
Aah!

1029
00:56:59,315 --> 00:57:00,460
Oof!

1030
00:57:02,708 --> 00:57:06,002
She always was high-spirited.

1031
00:57:06,035 --> 00:57:07,311
Uhh!

1032
00:57:16,113 --> 00:57:17,324
Oh!

1033
00:57:21,809 --> 00:57:23,118
All right, Jane.

1034
00:57:23,153 --> 00:57:24,679
Time to stop being
a clumsy Clara...

1035
00:57:24,721 --> 00:57:26,663
and use what
Tarzan's taught you.

1036
00:57:26,705 --> 00:57:27,950
Uhh!

1037
00:57:27,985 --> 00:57:30,603
Ooh. So far, so good.

1038
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:38,277
Aah!

1039
00:57:43,312 --> 00:57:45,036
Aah!

1040
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:48,042
Oh, dear. Whoa!

1041
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:49,541
Ooh! Stop it! Stop!

1042
00:57:49,584 --> 00:57:52,333
Eee! Oh! Ow!

1043
00:57:53,999 --> 00:57:56,038
Well-played, Jane.

1044
00:57:57,103 --> 00:57:59,273
But I simply can't
have you running off...

1045
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:01,165
and telling others
about me.

1046
00:58:01,198 --> 00:58:05,322
The Crown takes a rather
dim view of high treason.

1047
00:58:12,718 --> 00:58:15,881
Now, I promise you,
that was the last warning shot.

1048
00:58:18,221 --> 00:58:19,748
Ohh!

1049
00:58:54,698 --> 00:58:57,698
I say, old chap, good show.

1050
00:58:58,954 --> 00:59:00,067
Who are you?

1051
00:59:00,106 --> 00:59:02,049
Oh. Y-yes.

1052
00:59:02,091 --> 00:59:04,708
I suppose
proper introductions are due.

1053
00:59:04,746 --> 00:59:07,745
Captain Nigel Taylor of
Her Majesty's Royal Air Force...

1054
00:59:07,785 --> 00:59:09,608
counterintelligence division.

1055
00:59:09,641 --> 00:59:11,812
Your friend is already here.

1056
00:59:11,848 --> 00:59:14,150
- Friend?
- Robert Canler.

1057
00:59:14,185 --> 00:59:17,283
Sir, Robert Canler
is not my friend.

1058
00:59:17,321 --> 00:59:19,907
He's a rather
dastardly scoundrel.

1059
00:59:19,945 --> 00:59:22,311
Are you sure
you're not just jealous?

1060
00:59:22,345 --> 00:59:25,573
Jealous?!
Canler stole secret codes.

1061
00:59:25,607 --> 00:59:27,364
He betrayed our country.

1062
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,571
He shot me out of the sky.

1063
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:31,364
He betrayed your family?

1064
00:59:31,399 --> 00:59:32,577
You might say that.

1065
00:59:32,616 --> 00:59:36,390
My good fellow,
Robert Canler is a bad man...

1066
00:59:36,424 --> 00:59:39,423
a very bad man, indeed.

1067
00:59:43,687 --> 00:59:46,685
My apologies for
the Spartan accommodations.

1068
00:59:46,726 --> 00:59:48,450
I hope you're comfortable.

1069
00:59:48,486 --> 00:59:50,275
Fit to be tied, actually.

1070
00:59:50,310 --> 00:59:52,252
I'm sorry
it has to be this way, Jane.

1071
00:59:52,294 --> 00:59:54,182
I truly am.

1072
00:59:57,446 --> 01:00:01,188
Who-o-oa!

1073
01:00:05,893 --> 01:00:08,259
Blast!
Canler's eluded me again.

1074
01:00:08,292 --> 01:00:10,016
Tarzan, where are you going?

1075
01:00:10,052 --> 01:00:12,223
We can't possibly stop him now.

1076
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:14,682
You can't. I can.

1077
01:00:21,892 --> 01:00:23,069
Unh!

1078
01:00:25,379 --> 01:00:27,267
My, how dramatic.

1079
01:00:29,922 --> 01:00:32,444
Oh, what a bothersome chap.

1080
01:00:32,483 --> 01:00:34,457
Tarzan!

1081
01:00:35,587 --> 01:00:37,082
Jane!

1082
01:00:42,018 --> 01:00:44,920
Ah, ah, ah. Not too close.

1083
01:00:50,402 --> 01:00:52,703
Your Tarzan's
a tenacious fellow.

1084
01:00:52,738 --> 01:00:55,552
You have no idea.

1085
01:00:55,584 --> 01:00:59,479
Blast it, man.
Fall off already.

1086
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,408
Let Jane go!

1087
01:01:01,441 --> 01:01:03,349
Sorry, old bean.
That's not an option.

1088
01:01:03,393 --> 01:01:05,498
- Aah!
- Tarzan, no!

1089
01:01:06,945 --> 01:01:09,083
JANE..
Someone has to fly the plane!

1090
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:11,989
Oh, preferably
someone who knows how.

1091
01:01:12,032 --> 01:01:15,295
I hope Daddy
got that radio working.

1092
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:18,937
As I told you before...

1093
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:21,462
I have yet to meet
the trouble I cannot handle.

1094
01:01:22,432 --> 01:01:23,806
Haah!

1095
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,748
Um, Professor?

1096
01:01:25,790 --> 01:01:28,442
Yo, Professor, you here?

1097
01:01:28,479 --> 01:01:30,366
All right,
the coast is clear, Tantor.

1098
01:01:30,399 --> 01:01:33,181
Whew! The last thing I want...

1099
01:01:33,215 --> 01:01:35,963
is him plucking
one of my precious hairs.

1100
01:01:39,390 --> 01:01:41,757
Ho ho! Got it.

1101
01:01:41,791 --> 01:01:45,106
Ow! Ow!
My scalp! My scalp!

1102
01:01:45,150 --> 01:01:47,516
Oh. Actually,
it didn't hurt a bit.

1103
01:01:47,550 --> 01:01:48,760
Of course it didn't.

1104
01:01:48,797 --> 01:01:51,218
I'd never hurt
a friend like you, Tantor.

1105
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:52,919
Perish the thought.

1106
01:01:52,957 --> 01:01:55,542
Ha ha!
Now we'll finally be able...

1107
01:01:55,581 --> 01:01:57,970
to listen
to those cricket finals.

1108
01:01:58,013 --> 01:02:01,242
JANE.. Help!
Daddy, can you hear me?

1109
01:02:01,277 --> 01:02:04,625
Janey? Whatever are you doing
at the cricket finals?

1110
01:02:04,669 --> 01:02:07,222
I'm aboard Robert's aeroplane.
Ha ha ha!

1111
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:09,529
Which brings up
an interesting topic.

1112
01:02:09,564 --> 01:02:12,912
You don't happen to know
how to fly a plane, do you?

1113
01:02:12,955 --> 01:02:16,632
Well, I have read
a thing or two on the subject.

1114
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:18,358
Now, let's see. Hmm.

1115
01:02:18,395 --> 01:02:21,525
I believe you push forward
on the yoke...

1116
01:02:21,562 --> 01:02:23,057
to tilt upwards.

1117
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:26,902
JANE.. Aah!

1118
01:02:26,939 --> 01:02:28,051
Or is it pull back?

1119
01:02:28,091 --> 01:02:30,194
Pull back, pull back!

1120
01:02:30,235 --> 01:02:33,583
I believe you're right, Jane.
It is pull back.

1121
01:02:33,626 --> 01:02:36,081
- Sounds right to me.
- Suddenly you're an expert?

1122
01:02:36,122 --> 01:02:38,991
Now, landing is quite simple.

1123
01:02:39,034 --> 01:02:42,514
Just keep the nose up.

1124
01:02:42,553 --> 01:02:45,236
Right. Nose up. Right.

1125
01:02:46,872 --> 01:02:48,847
Aah! Ohh!

1126
01:02:48,889 --> 01:02:51,376
All right, all right!

1127
01:02:51,416 --> 01:02:53,423
You win.

1128
01:02:53,464 --> 01:02:54,894
JANE.. Gentlemen?

1129
01:02:54,936 --> 01:02:58,286
Brace yourselves.
It's going to be a bumpy ride.

1130
01:03:02,328 --> 01:03:04,816
I do believe we have a problem.

1131
01:03:14,007 --> 01:03:16,821
Oh, good show, Tarzan!
Simply marvelous!

1132
01:03:16,854 --> 01:03:19,091
Yes, indeed. Ha!

1133
01:03:19,126 --> 01:03:21,460
I hope you don't think me
ungrateful, Tarzan...

1134
01:03:21,494 --> 01:03:23,566
but I have
a code machine to deliver.

1135
01:03:25,366 --> 01:03:27,025
And don't try to follow me...

1136
01:03:27,062 --> 01:03:29,005
or I shall be forced
to cut this vine.

1137
01:03:29,047 --> 01:03:33,682
Jane, it was ever so good
seeing you again. Ta-ta.

1138
01:03:34,742 --> 01:03:37,230
I wish the feeling was mutual.

1139
01:03:40,628 --> 01:03:41,774
Tarzan!

1140
01:03:43,989 --> 01:03:46,671
Uhh!

1141
01:03:46,708 --> 01:03:50,025
Aah! Help!

1142
01:03:50,069 --> 01:03:52,818
- Help!
- Jane.

1143
01:03:59,603 --> 01:04:01,643
Aah!

1144
01:04:08,370 --> 01:04:11,054
Unh!

1145
01:04:11,090 --> 01:04:12,977
- Aah!
- No!

1146
01:04:21,521 --> 01:04:25,449
Oh! Well done, Robert.
Well done.

1147
01:04:25,489 --> 01:04:26,766
Thank you, Jane.

1148
01:04:26,802 --> 01:04:30,379
So, Tarzan,
no harm, no foul, right?

1149
01:04:30,417 --> 01:04:32,906
Land the plane... now!

1150
01:04:32,946 --> 01:04:35,050
ROBERT..
Just thought I'd ask.

1151
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:42,439
That ought to hold even
a scoundrel like you, Canler.

1152
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,455
Don't worry about me, Janey.

1153
01:04:44,496 --> 01:04:46,950
With the possible exception
of Tarzan...

1154
01:04:46,992 --> 01:04:49,480
there's no trouble
I can't handle.

1155
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:50,698
Perhaps.

1156
01:04:50,737 --> 01:04:52,940
The courts may have
a different opinion.

1157
01:04:54,736 --> 01:04:55,663
Good-bye, Robert.

1158
01:04:55,695 --> 01:04:57,157
Not good-bye, Jane...

1159
01:04:57,199 --> 01:05:00,844
just "until the next time. "

1160
01:05:00,879 --> 01:05:03,846
Your instincts were right,
Tarzan.

1161
01:05:03,886 --> 01:05:05,479
Robert was up to no good.

1162
01:05:05,519 --> 01:05:07,886
Yes, but he did save you...

1163
01:05:07,919 --> 01:05:11,302
so maybe
there is some good in him.

1164
01:05:11,343 --> 01:05:14,473
All's well that ends well,
I guess.

1165
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:18,252
Jane, do you recall
how hurt Tarzan was...

1166
01:05:18,285 --> 01:05:20,141
when he saw you
dancing with Bobby?

1167
01:05:20,174 --> 01:05:21,417
Yes.

1168
01:05:21,453 --> 01:05:24,006
Well, I'm afraid
asking him to dance...

1169
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:27,340
may reopen those old wounds.

1170
01:05:27,373 --> 01:05:29,707
So now what am I left with?

1171
01:05:29,741 --> 01:05:32,196
I can't have a party.
I can't give a gift.

1172
01:05:32,236 --> 01:05:33,959
I can't even dance
with my own husband...

1173
01:05:33,996 --> 01:05:35,491
on our anniversary.

1174
01:05:35,532 --> 01:05:39,842
Jane...
anniversaries are very...

1175
01:05:39,884 --> 01:05:41,892
civilized notions...

1176
01:05:41,932 --> 01:05:45,642
and Tarzan
isn't a civilized man.

1177
01:05:47,115 --> 01:05:50,280
All right, then. So be it.

1178
01:05:58,187 --> 01:06:01,318
Happy anniversary, Jane Porter.

1179
01:06:01,355 --> 01:06:04,201
ALL.. Surprise!

1180
01:06:04,234 --> 01:06:07,050
- What is this?
- Our anniversary party.

1181
01:06:07,083 --> 01:06:08,838
Ha ha! Party?

1182
01:06:08,873 --> 01:06:10,630
It's our anniversary, Jane.

1183
01:06:10,666 --> 01:06:14,081
Tarzan, you're wearing
your father's suit.

1184
01:06:14,121 --> 01:06:19,303
Yes. I thought I should be
better dressed for a party.

1185
01:06:21,321 --> 01:06:24,737
Ah. You three knew all along.

1186
01:06:24,777 --> 01:06:27,646
Guilty as charged.
Ha ha ha.

1187
01:06:27,689 --> 01:06:29,096
Jane, there's more.

1188
01:06:29,129 --> 01:06:31,910
More?
What more could I possibly want?

1189
01:06:31,945 --> 01:06:33,734
How about this?

1190
01:06:33,768 --> 01:06:37,761
Oh, Tarzan, it's huge!

1191
01:06:37,801 --> 01:06:39,873
Did this come
from the diamond mine?

1192
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:41,887
Ha ha. Yes.
I've been waiting...

1193
01:06:41,928 --> 01:06:44,229
for the right moment
to give it to you.

1194
01:06:44,264 --> 01:06:47,459
You understand my world better
than I ever thought.

1195
01:06:47,495 --> 01:06:49,600
Just as you understand mine.

1196
01:06:53,478 --> 01:06:55,550
CHORUS.. # Singin'

1197

# Celebration #

1238
01:08:51,517 --> 01:08:55,293
#A song
that dances on the wind #

1239
01:08:55,326 --> 01:08:59,385
# Sieving through the trees #

1240
01:08:59,422 --> 01:09:03,448
# It's opened up
my world and sky #

1241
01:09:03,485 --> 01:09:07,893
#And made them new for me #
