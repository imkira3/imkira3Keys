00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,808
-Good morning.
-Morning.

3
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:44,459
-State your name for the record.
-Daniel Ocean.

4
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:48,472
Thank you. The purpose of this
hearing is to determine...

5
00:00:48,672 --> 00:00:51,641
...whether you are
likely to break the law again.

6
00:00:51,842 --> 00:00:56,536
This was your first conviction,
but you were implicated...

7
00:00:56,738 --> 00:00:59,106
...in a dozen other schemes
and frauds.

8
00:00:59,305 --> 00:01:01,793
What can you tell us about this?

9
00:01:02,636 --> 00:01:05,444
As you say, ma'am,
I was never charged.

10
00:01:06,128 --> 00:01:08,374
We're trying to find out...

11
00:01:08,575 --> 00:01:11,383
...if there was a reason
for committing this crime...

12
00:01:11,584 --> 00:01:14,433
...or just a reason
you got caught this time.

13
00:01:14,633 --> 00:01:19,247
My wife left me. I was upset.
I got into a self-destructive pattern.

14
00:01:20,533 --> 00:01:24,826
If released, is it likely you'd fall
back into a similar pattern?

15
00:01:25,026 --> 00:01:29,440
She left me once. I doubt
she'd do it again just for kicks.

16
00:01:29,641 --> 00:01:33,813
Mr. Ocean, what do you think
you would do if released?

17
00:02:55,268 --> 00:02:56,714
-Chips, please.
-Sure.

18
00:02:59,602 --> 00:03:03,214
-Change 1 50. Quarters or nickels?
-Quarters are fine.

19
00:03:06,022 --> 00:03:07,828
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

20
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:18,782
Twenty. Dealer has 1 9. Good start.

21
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:26,287
-I'm going on break now.
-Here. Thank you very much.

22
00:03:27,571 --> 00:03:30,259
-Good luck.
-You have a good one.

23
00:03:31,101 --> 00:03:33,910
-How are you, sir?
-Hello, Frank.

24
00:03:37,602 --> 00:03:42,216
I beg your pardon. You must have me
confused with someone else.

25
00:03:42,417 --> 00:03:46,068
My name is Ramon.
As you can see right here.

26
00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:52,007
-My mistake.
-No problem, sir.

27
00:03:52,368 --> 00:03:54,816
The table's cold anyway.

28
00:03:55,017 --> 00:03:59,390
You might want to try the lounge
at Caesars. Gets busy after 1 :00.

29
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,356
-1 :00?
-Yes, sir.

30
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,924
Thanks, Ramon.

31
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,532
Thank you.

32
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,372
-Checking up on current events?
-Ramon.

33
00:04:19,574 --> 00:04:24,348
Glad to meet you. Frank Catton
can't get past the gaming board.

34
00:04:24,548 --> 00:04:26,837
-You just got out?
-This afternoon.

35
00:04:27,357 --> 00:04:28,360
You seen him?

36
00:04:28,762 --> 00:04:33,496
I heard he was teaching movie stars
how to play cards. Why?

37
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:35,744
You have a plan already?

38
00:04:36,065 --> 00:04:39,075
Are you kidding?
I just became a citizen again.

39
00:04:39,274 --> 00:04:40,559
Officer Brooks...

40
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,294
...this is Danny Ocean. I was told
to contact you within 24 hours.

41
00:04:46,177 --> 00:04:48,986
No, sir, I haven't
been getting in trouble.

42
00:04:50,309 --> 00:04:52,557
No, sir, I haven't been drinking.

43
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,690
No, sir, I wouldn't even think
about leaving the state.

44
00:05:10,251 --> 00:05:13,663
Hey, Russ! Rusty. What's up, man?

45
00:05:17,034 --> 00:05:20,644
Let me ask you a question.
Are you incorporated?

46
00:05:20,845 --> 00:05:24,457
You should think about it.
I talked to my manager--

47
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:28,229
-Bernie?
-Not Bernie. My business manager.

48
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:31,118
Actually, they' re both named Bernie.

49
00:05:31,438 --> 00:05:35,251
He said what we do could
be considered research...

50
00:05:35,491 --> 00:05:39,384
...for a future gig, so I could
make it a tax write-off.

51
00:05:39,584 --> 00:05:43,315
The one thing is, and this is
his thing and it's stupid...

52
00:05:43,517 --> 00:05:46,365
...but I'd have to pay you by check.

53
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,508
Or we could just stick to cash.

54
00:05:53,829 --> 00:05:56,236
Yeah, let's just stick to cash.

55
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,512
We'll begin with five-card draw.
Everyone remember that?

56
00:06:07,752 --> 00:06:10,481
Who wants to start us out? Josh?

57
00:06:13,049 --> 00:06:15,095
Josh. To the left.

58
00:06:15,617 --> 00:06:16,820
Deal to your left.

59
00:06:17,022 --> 00:06:18,547
-Shane?
-Hit me.

60
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:21,356
-It's not blackjack.
-Dude!

61
00:06:21,555 --> 00:06:25,487
Looking at them doesn't change them.
You know what you have.

62
00:06:27,735 --> 00:06:29,621
-Left. Left.
-Left, I'll get it.

63
00:06:29,821 --> 00:06:31,868
Lady bets. Let's keep it moving.

64
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:34,476
-Blue.
-Blue, that's a 50.

65
00:06:34,677 --> 00:06:36,322
-I'll call?
-Okay.

66
00:06:36,643 --> 00:06:38,489
Shane's calling. 50.

67
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:41,498
What the hell, it's only
pocket change.

68
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:45,270
Betting's your business.
Pretend it's for a reason.

69
00:06:45,511 --> 00:06:46,795
Yeah, thanks, man.

70
00:06:47,437 --> 00:06:49,041
-Right.
-How many?

71
00:06:49,362 --> 00:06:53,135
-Four.
-You don't want four. You wanna fold.

72
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:54,940
-I wanna fold?
-Fold.

73
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:56,546
Is that good?

74
00:06:56,827 --> 00:06:59,996
You're done. Let's take that.
You're done.

75
00:07:00,436 --> 00:07:03,246
You're done. You have three pairs.

76
00:07:03,568 --> 00:07:06,938
You can't have six cards
in a five-card game.

77
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:09,264
-Maybe one was mine.
-Wasn't me.

78
00:07:09,466 --> 00:07:10,469
Fellas!

79
00:07:10,871 --> 00:07:13,679
All reds.

80
00:07:14,963 --> 00:07:16,488
What up, dog?

81
00:07:21,824 --> 00:07:26,159
I'm gonna love spending your money.
I'm gonna get my car washed.

82
00:07:38,637 --> 00:07:42,168
-How's the game going?
-Longest hour of my life.

83
00:07:43,332 --> 00:07:46,783
-What?
-I'm running away with your wife.

84
00:07:47,103 --> 00:07:48,668
Great.

85
00:07:57,616 --> 00:08:01,308
Isn't that hard, crossing over
from television to film?

86
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:03,395
Not for me, dude.

87
00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:07,126
Hey, Russ. We got another player...

88
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:09,252
...if that's cool with you.

89
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:15,232
What do you do for a living?
lf you don't mind me asking.

90
00:08:15,432 --> 00:08:17,600
Why would I mind you asking?

91
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,125
Two cards.

92
00:08:19,364 --> 00:08:21,812
I just got out of prison.

93
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:26,306
-Really?
-Why were you in prison?

94
00:08:26,868 --> 00:08:28,834
I stole things.

95
00:08:29,035 --> 00:08:32,405
You stole things? Like jewels?

96
00:08:32,766 --> 00:08:35,777
Incan matrimonial head masks.

97
00:08:36,739 --> 00:08:40,592
-Any money in lncan matrimonial--?
-Head masks. Some.

98
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:44,684
Don't let him fool you. There's
loads if you can move them.

99
00:08:44,885 --> 00:08:48,978
-I'll take one. But you can't.
-My fence seemed confident.

100
00:08:49,178 --> 00:08:52,469
-With cash you don't need a fence.
-Some lack vision.

101
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:54,997
Probably everybody in cellblock E.

102
00:08:55,196 --> 00:08:56,882
That's $500.

103
00:08:57,645 --> 00:09:01,337
-What's the first lesson in poker?
-Never bet on the--

104
00:09:01,536 --> 00:09:04,024
-No, leave emotion at the door.
-Right.

105
00:09:04,225 --> 00:09:06,914
Today's lesson:
How to draw out the bluff.

106
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:09,240
That much money early in the game....

107
00:09:09,442 --> 00:09:12,772
He has nothing better than
a pair of face cards.

108
00:09:12,933 --> 00:09:14,337
Barry?

109
00:09:17,186 --> 00:09:18,470
All right.

110
00:09:18,911 --> 00:09:20,638
I fold.

111
00:09:22,683 --> 00:09:25,090
-Josh?
-Don't worry, I'm game.

112
00:09:25,292 --> 00:09:29,826
I will see your $500
and I will raise you another...

113
00:09:30,427 --> 00:09:33,717
-...$500 of my own.
-That's a very handsome bet.

114
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:39,416
Careful, don't push him too high,
too fast. I Keep him on the leash.

115
00:09:39,617 --> 00:09:41,502
-Holly?
-Call.

116
00:09:42,304 --> 00:09:43,589
Call.

117
00:09:44,391 --> 00:09:45,995
And I'll call.

118
00:09:49,367 --> 00:09:53,059
I'll see your $500
and raise you $2000.

119
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,071
Guys, you do what you like.
That's a lot of money.

120
00:09:57,271 --> 00:10:02,247
I'm staying in. He's trying to buy
his way out of his bluff.

121
00:10:03,532 --> 00:10:06,139
-Josh?
-Two.

122
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,641
Thattagirl. Call.

123
00:10:13,161 --> 00:10:15,730
-Call.
-Call.

124
00:10:18,498 --> 00:10:20,143
Let's see them.

125
00:10:20,344 --> 00:10:25,962
I'm not sure what four nines does,
but the ace, I think, is pretty high.

126
00:10:27,045 --> 00:10:29,292
Thanks for the tip on bluffing.

127
00:10:29,853 --> 00:10:34,628
Hey, Topher! How about an autograph?
Come on, real quick.

128
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:53,448
-God, I'm bored.
-You look bored.

129
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:57,701
How was the clink?
You get the cookies I sent?

130
00:10:58,182 --> 00:11:01,032
Why do you think I
came to see you first?

131
00:11:01,834 --> 00:11:04,081
-So tell me.
-It's tricky.

132
00:11:04,402 --> 00:11:08,776
It's never been done before.
It'll need planning and a large crew.

133
00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:12,868
-Guns?
-Not quite. High security. The take--

134
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,116
-The target?
-Eight figures.

135
00:11:15,316 --> 00:11:17,122
What's the target?

136
00:11:18,566 --> 00:11:21,576
When was the last time
you were in Vegas?

137
00:11:21,776 --> 00:11:24,465
You want to knock over a casino?

138
00:11:37,225 --> 00:11:39,110
The vault at the Bellagio.

139
00:11:43,765 --> 00:11:47,617
If I'm reading this right,
and I'd like to think I am...

140
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:52,352
...this is probably the least
accessible vault ever designed.

141
00:11:53,476 --> 00:11:55,361
You said three casinos?

142
00:11:55,602 --> 00:12:01,260
These feed into the Mirage and MGM
Grand, but every dime ends up there.

143
00:12:02,183 --> 00:12:04,511
The Bellagio and the Mirage.

144
00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:08,483
-These are Terry Benedict's places.
-Yes, they are.

145
00:12:09,165 --> 00:12:11,853
-Think he'll mind?
-More than somewhat.

146
00:12:12,054 --> 00:12:16,027
You'd need at least 1 2 guys
doing a combination of cons.

147
00:12:16,226 --> 00:12:17,792
Like what, you think?

148
00:12:17,993 --> 00:12:23,049
Off the top of my head, I'd say you're
looking at a Boesky, a Jim Brown...

149
00:12:23,248 --> 00:12:25,576
...a Miss Daisy and a Leon Spinks.

150
00:12:25,818 --> 00:12:29,509
Not to mention the biggest
Ella Fitzgerald ever.

151
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:32,518
Where will you get
the money to back this?

152
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:35,648
Hit these three casinos,
we'll get our bankroll.

153
00:12:35,849 --> 00:12:38,176
Benedict's got a list of enemies.

154
00:12:38,417 --> 00:12:42,069
But enemies with loose
cash and nothing to lose?

155
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:46,723
-Reuben.
-Reuben.

156
00:12:46,963 --> 00:12:48,368
Hey.

157
00:12:49,612 --> 00:12:51,819
Oscar, lower it a bit, would you?

158
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,349
Sorry. You guys done?
Find what you want?

159
00:12:55,551 --> 00:12:58,480
We'll take these for the night
to make copies.

160
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,570
-Whatever you need.
-Appreciate it.

161
00:13:08,752 --> 00:13:09,955
What?

162
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,885
I need a reason.

163
00:13:13,687 --> 00:13:16,055
And don't say money. Why do this?

164
00:13:16,214 --> 00:13:17,259
Why not do it?

165
00:13:23,157 --> 00:13:26,888
I just left the joint after
losing four years of my life...

166
00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:30,019
...and you're cold-decking
Teen Beat cover boys.

167
00:13:31,904 --> 00:13:33,991
Because the house always wins.

168
00:13:34,191 --> 00:13:37,280
Play long enough,
the house takes you.

169
00:13:37,482 --> 00:13:42,859
Unless, when that perfect hand comes,
you bet big. Then you take the house.

170
00:13:45,748 --> 00:13:48,517
-You practiced that speech?
-Did I rush it?

171
00:13:48,717 --> 00:13:51,164
It was good.
The Teen Beat thing was harsh.

172
00:13:54,857 --> 00:13:56,902
I wonder what Reuben will say.

173
00:13:57,946 --> 00:14:00,393
You're out of your damn minds!

174
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:03,764
You're both of you nuts!

175
00:14:03,965 --> 00:14:09,221
I know more about casino security
than any man. I invented it.

176
00:14:09,422 --> 00:14:11,228
And it cannot be beaten.

177
00:14:11,428 --> 00:14:14,438
They got cameras and watchers,
they got locks.

178
00:14:14,638 --> 00:14:16,404
They got timers, vaults.

179
00:14:16,725 --> 00:14:20,256
They got enough armed
personnel to occupy Paris!

180
00:14:21,058 --> 00:14:23,185
Okay, bad example.

181
00:14:23,385 --> 00:14:25,030
It's never been tried.

182
00:14:26,034 --> 00:14:30,448
It's been tried.
A few guys even came close.

183
00:14:30,648 --> 00:14:34,219
You know the three most successful
robberies in Vegas?

184
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,346
Number three, the bronze medal.

185
00:14:36,547 --> 00:14:39,557
Pencil neck grabs a
lockbox at the Horseshoe.

186
00:14:39,756 --> 00:14:41,883
Grab the guy in the suit!

187
00:14:42,646 --> 00:14:46,298
He got two steps closer to
the door than anyone before.

188
00:14:46,498 --> 00:14:47,621
Leave the money!

189
00:14:47,823 --> 00:14:49,708
Second most successful robbery:

190
00:14:49,909 --> 00:14:54,242
The Flamingo in '7 1. This guy
actually tasted fresh oxygen...

191
00:14:54,442 --> 00:14:56,008
...before they grabbed him.

192
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:01,184
Of course, he was breathing out
ofa hose for the next three weeks.

193
00:15:01,384 --> 00:15:03,150
Goddamn hippie.

194
00:15:03,471 --> 00:15:06,481
And the closest any man
has ever come...

195
00:15:06,762 --> 00:15:08,647
...to robbing a Las Vegas casino...

196
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:11,778
... was outside of Caesars in '87.

197
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,863
He came...

198
00:15:14,826 --> 00:15:16,110
...he grabbed...

199
00:15:16,913 --> 00:15:18,679
...they conquered.

200
00:15:23,654 --> 00:15:28,108
But what am I saying? You guys
are pros. The best.

201
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:31,198
I'm sure you can make
it out of the casino.

202
00:15:31,439 --> 00:15:33,686
Of course, lest we forget...

203
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:38,863
...once you're out, you're still
in the middle of the fucking desert!

204
00:15:39,303 --> 00:15:40,989
You're right. He's right.

205
00:15:41,229 --> 00:15:43,758
Our eyes were bigger than
our stomachs.

206
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:46,887
-That's what it is. Ego.
-Yeah, blah, blah.

207
00:15:47,088 --> 00:15:49,937
-Thanks for lunch.
-The nicoise was delicious.

208
00:15:50,097 --> 00:15:53,468
-Sorry to bother you.
-Look, we go way back...

209
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:56,718
...and I owe you from the thing
with the guy.

210
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:59,526
-Our pleasure.
-I'd never been to Belize.

211
00:15:59,728 --> 00:16:04,262
Give Dominic your addresses.
I got some furniture to send you.

212
00:16:05,385 --> 00:16:11,043
Just out of curiosity, which casinos
did you geniuses pick to rob?

213
00:16:12,247 --> 00:16:15,457
The Bellagio, the Mirage and
the MGM Grand.

214
00:16:17,302 --> 00:16:19,790
Those are Terry Benedict's casinos.

215
00:16:20,754 --> 00:16:22,960
-Is that right?
-That's right.

216
00:16:23,762 --> 00:16:25,047
You guys...

217
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,300
...what do you got against
Terry Benedict?

218
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,590
What do you have against
him, is the question.

219
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:37,646
He torpedoed my casino.
Muscled me out.

220
00:16:38,168 --> 00:16:43,104
Now he's gonna blow it up next month
to make way for some monstrosity.

221
00:16:43,424 --> 00:16:46,795
-I see what you're doing.
-What are we doing?

222
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:52,532
If you're gonna steal from Terry
Benedict, you better goddamn know.

223
00:16:52,734 --> 00:16:56,666
This used to be civilized.
You'd hit a guy, he'd whack you.

224
00:16:56,867 --> 00:16:58,672
But Benedict....

225
00:16:59,636 --> 00:17:03,287
At the end of it, he'd better not
know you're involved.

226
00:17:03,567 --> 00:17:08,183
Because he'll kill you,
then he'll go to work on you.

227
00:17:09,064 --> 00:17:12,476
That's why we have to be
very careful, very precise.

228
00:17:12,756 --> 00:17:14,000
Well-funded.

229
00:17:14,963 --> 00:17:17,050
You gotta be nuts too.

230
00:17:17,372 --> 00:17:21,384
And you're gonna need a
crew as nuts as you are.

231
00:17:24,593 --> 00:17:26,279
Who do you got in mind?

232
00:17:27,001 --> 00:17:30,332
-Alright, who 's in?
-Frank C. is in.

233
00:17:30,652 --> 00:17:35,988
Frank has bronchitis and is applying
for a transfer to warmer climates.

234
00:17:41,526 --> 00:17:42,449
Drivers?

235
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:45,218
-I talked to the Malloys.
-Mormon twins?

236
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:47,787
They're in Utah, off the job.

237
00:17:48,428 --> 00:17:51,276
They're having
trouble filling the hours.

238
00:18:05,642 --> 00:18:08,330
-Waiting, sweetheart.
-Good. Go.

239
00:18:08,531 --> 00:18:09,816
-I'm waiting.
-Why?

240
00:18:10,016 --> 00:18:11,862
-You're a little girl !
-Relax.

241
00:18:12,022 --> 00:18:16,396
I'm going to get out and
drop you like third-period French.

242
00:18:16,677 --> 00:18:17,840
Relax.

243
00:18:54,074 --> 00:18:56,441
-Electronics?
-Livingston Dell.

244
00:18:56,722 --> 00:19:00,575
He 's been doing surveillance
work for the FBI mob squad.

245
00:19:00,774 --> 00:19:03,344
-How are his nerves?
-Not so bad.

246
00:19:03,544 --> 00:19:05,510
Move in a little bit.

247
00:19:07,155 --> 00:19:10,927
-Don't-- Don't touch that.
-Why not?

248
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:15,380
Do you see me grabbing your
gun and waving it around?

249
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:18,029
Hey, RadioShack. Relax.

250
00:19:27,619 --> 00:19:28,663
Munitions.

251
00:19:28,903 --> 00:19:30,830
-Phil Turrentine.
-Dead.

252
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,718
-No shit. On the job?
-Skin cancer.

253
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,888
-You send flowers?
-Dated his wife for a while.

254
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,096
Basher's in town.

255
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:42,586
There may be an issue
with availability.

256
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:50,170
All right, chaps...

257
00:19:51,454 --> 00:19:53,339
...hang on to your knickers.

258
00:20:10,754 --> 00:20:12,921
Oh, leave it out!

259
00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:18,498
You tossers! You had one job to do!

260
00:20:22,712 --> 00:20:24,838
That's all you used in the event?

261
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:28,529
-You accusing me of booby-trapping?
-Well?

262
00:20:28,771 --> 00:20:32,422
Booby traps aren't Mr. Tarr's style.
Isn't that right?

263
00:20:33,064 --> 00:20:34,307
Basher?

264
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,596
Peck. ATF.

265
00:20:37,037 --> 00:20:38,522
Let me venture a guess.

266
00:20:38,803 --> 00:20:43,938
Simple G-4 mainliner, back wound,
quick fuse with a drag under 20 feet.

267
00:20:44,581 --> 00:20:47,469
Let me ask you this.
You search this scumbag...

268
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:50,679
...for booby traps?
I mean, really searched.

269
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:52,364
Stand back.

270
00:20:52,686 --> 00:20:54,130
Here we go.

271
00:20:54,531 --> 00:20:56,819
-Find Griggs. I need him.
-Who?

272
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,865
Just find him, will you?

273
00:21:00,349 --> 00:21:03,760
Can you put something together
with what I gave you?

274
00:21:03,961 --> 00:21:05,085
Done.

275
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:09,499
-Is Danny about?
-He's around the corner.

276
00:21:09,699 --> 00:21:13,471
Terrific. It'll be nice working with
proper villains again.

277
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:15,959
Everybody down! Get down!

278
00:21:17,844 --> 00:21:20,131
They weren't expecting that shit!

279
00:21:20,532 --> 00:21:21,978
-Nice work.
-Thanks.

280
00:21:40,114 --> 00:21:44,127
-Which one's the Amazing Yen?
-The little Chinese guy.

281
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:51,310
-Who else is on the list?
-He is the list.

282
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:57,730
It doesn't seem that diff--

283
00:22:06,677 --> 00:22:09,526
-We got a grease man.
-We got a grease man.

284
00:22:14,341 --> 00:22:15,786
We need Saul.

285
00:22:16,027 --> 00:22:19,638
-He got out of the game a year ago.
-He get religion?

286
00:22:19,959 --> 00:22:21,243
Ulcers.

287
00:22:23,651 --> 00:22:26,540
-You could ask him.
-Hey, I could ask him.

288
00:22:53,223 --> 00:22:56,113
I saw you at the paddock...

289
00:22:56,433 --> 00:23:01,208
...before the second race, outside the
men's room when I placed my bet.

290
00:23:02,412 --> 00:23:05,422
I saw you before you even
got up this morning.

291
00:23:05,863 --> 00:23:08,912
-How you been, Saul?
-Never better.

292
00:23:09,153 --> 00:23:10,919
What's with the orange?

293
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,573
-My doctor says I need vitamins.
-Why don't you take vitamins?

294
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,262
You come here to give me a physical?

295
00:23:18,824 --> 00:23:20,590
Box seats. Come on.

296
00:23:32,747 --> 00:23:37,040
You gonna tell me? Or should I
say no and get it over with?

297
00:23:37,241 --> 00:23:40,893
You're the best. You're in
Cooperstown. What do you want?

298
00:23:41,094 --> 00:23:43,781
Nothing. I got a duplex now.

299
00:23:44,062 --> 00:23:46,350
I got wall-to-wall and a goldfish.

300
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:50,563
I'm seeing a lady who works the
counter at Macy's.

301
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:52,208
I've changed.

302
00:23:56,060 --> 00:24:00,032
Guys like us don't change.
We stay sharp or get sloppy.

303
00:24:00,554 --> 00:24:02,201
Quit conning me.

304
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,728
That your hound way in the rear?

305
00:24:04,928 --> 00:24:07,656
He breaks late. Everyone knows this.

306
00:24:11,108 --> 00:24:14,478
You going to treat me
like a grownup at least?

307
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:16,685
Tell me what the scam is?

308
00:24:45,415 --> 00:24:48,865
Exhibit C: His belt as
king of the heavyweight crown.

309
00:24:49,307 --> 00:24:53,080
Lennox Lewis has proved
he 's the champion.

310
00:24:54,443 --> 00:24:58,175
Saul makes 10.
Ten should do it, don't you think?

311
00:24:59,338 --> 00:25:01,225
You think we need one more?

312
00:25:02,268 --> 00:25:04,074
You think we need one more.

313
00:25:06,161 --> 00:25:08,247
Alright, we'll get one more.

314
00:26:23,161 --> 00:26:26,211
Hello, Linus. Whose is this?

315
00:26:27,495 --> 00:26:30,505
-Who are you?
-A friend of Bobby Caldwell's.

316
00:26:31,748 --> 00:26:34,999
You're either in or out. Right now.

317
00:26:37,808 --> 00:26:41,740
-What is it?
-It's a plane ticket. A job offer.

318
00:26:42,943 --> 00:26:46,514
-You're pretty trusting.
-Bobby has faith in you.

319
00:26:46,755 --> 00:26:48,922
Fathers are like that.

320
00:26:49,364 --> 00:26:53,175
He didn't tell you? He doesn't
want me trading on his name.

321
00:26:53,376 --> 00:26:55,904
Do this job, he'll be
trading on yours.

322
00:26:56,105 --> 00:26:59,556
Don't, and you can go back to
feeling up stockbrokers.

323
00:26:59,756 --> 00:27:01,963
Can you get the check, please?

324
00:27:05,173 --> 00:27:07,219
That's the best lift you've made yet.

325
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,065
Las Vegas?

326
00:27:09,426 --> 00:27:10,990
America's playground.

327
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:58,140
Did you guys get a group
rate or something?

328
00:28:04,237 --> 00:28:06,605
Saul, do you get out to Utah much?

329
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:10,378
Not as often as I'd like.

330
00:28:10,698 --> 00:28:15,313
Check it out. I think you'd dig Provo.
You could do well there.

331
00:28:15,635 --> 00:28:17,399
I'll look into it.

332
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:22,816
Welcome to Las Vegas.
Has everybody eaten? Good.

333
00:28:23,177 --> 00:28:24,943
Everybody sober?

334
00:28:25,505 --> 00:28:29,838
Close enough. Before we start,
nobody's on the line yet.

335
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:34,453
What I'm about to propose is highly
lucrative and highly dangerous.

336
00:28:34,653 --> 00:28:37,261
If that's not your brand of vodka...

337
00:28:37,462 --> 00:28:42,037
...eat as much as you like and have
a safe journey. No hard feelings.

338
00:28:42,198 --> 00:28:43,922
Otherwise, come with me.

339
00:28:52,951 --> 00:28:54,957
You're Bobby Caldwell's kid?

340
00:28:56,442 --> 00:28:59,251
-From Chicago?
-Yeah.

341
00:29:00,294 --> 00:29:02,661
-You like it there?
-Yeah.

342
00:29:02,861 --> 00:29:06,714
That's wonderful.
Get in the goddamn house.

343
00:29:15,983 --> 00:29:18,831
The 3000 block of
Las Vegas Boulevard...

344
00:29:19,193 --> 00:29:22,443
...also known as the
Bellagio, Mirage and MGM Grand.

345
00:29:22,684 --> 00:29:26,696
They' re three of the most
profitable casinos in Las Vegas.

346
00:29:29,264 --> 00:29:31,672
This is the Bellagio vault, located...

347
00:29:31,873 --> 00:29:34,520
...beneath 200 feet of solid earth.

348
00:29:34,722 --> 00:29:39,617
It safeguards every dime that passes
through each of the three casinos.

349
00:29:39,818 --> 00:29:42,787
-We're gonna rob it.
-Smash-and-grab job?

350
00:29:42,988 --> 00:29:45,356
Slightly more complicated than that.

351
00:29:46,077 --> 00:29:47,562
Well, yeah.

352
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:53,139
This is courtesy of Frank Catton,
a new dealer at the Bellagio.

353
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,785
Bad news first.

354
00:29:54,985 --> 00:29:59,158
This place houses a security system
rivaling most nuclear silos.

355
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:04,214
First, we have to get in the casino
cages, which takes more than a smile.

356
00:30:04,415 --> 00:30:06,823
Next, through these doors...

357
00:30:07,023 --> 00:30:11,277
...each one requiring a different
code changed every 1 2 hours.

358
00:30:11,516 --> 00:30:15,088
Past those, the elevator.
Here's where it gets tricky.

359
00:30:15,289 --> 00:30:19,743
-It won't move without fingerprint l.D.
-Which we can't fake.

360
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:24,718
And vocal confirmation from the system
within the Bellagio and the vault.

361
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:26,444
Which we won't get.

362
00:30:26,644 --> 00:30:29,533
The elevator shaft is rigged
with sensors.

363
00:30:29,734 --> 00:30:34,348
If we override the lift, the exit
would lock and we'd be trapped.

364
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:37,880
Once we get down the shaft,
it's a piece of cake.

365
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:41,250
Just two more guards with Uzis...

366
00:30:41,572 --> 00:30:45,102
...and the most elaborate vault
door ever conceived.

367
00:30:45,744 --> 00:30:47,349
Any questions?

368
00:30:50,077 --> 00:30:51,804
Tunneling's out. There are...

369
00:30:52,004 --> 00:30:56,699
...sensors monitoring the ground.
If a groundhog nested, they'd know.

370
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:00,350
-Anyone else?
-You mentioned good news?

371
00:31:00,551 --> 00:31:03,480
Yeah. The Nevada Gaming
Commission requires...

372
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:08,455
...a casino to keep enough cash to
cover every chip in play on the floor.

373
00:31:08,656 --> 00:31:11,987
That means on a weekday
it must carry...

374
00:31:12,187 --> 00:31:15,156
...between $60 and $70 million in
cash and coin.

375
00:31:15,317 --> 00:31:19,129
On the weekend, between 80 and 90
million. On a fight night...

376
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:22,299
...like in two weeks,
the night we're robbing it...

377
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,750
...$1 50 million,
without breaking a sweat.

378
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:29,802
There are 1 1 of us,
each with an equal share.

379
00:31:30,284 --> 00:31:31,568
You do the math.

380
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,173
Exactly.

381
00:31:33,373 --> 00:31:34,698
I have a question.

382
00:31:35,219 --> 00:31:39,151
Say we get into the cage
and through the security doors...

383
00:31:39,352 --> 00:31:41,639
...down the elevator
we can't move...

384
00:31:41,841 --> 00:31:45,813
...past the guards with the guns,
into the vault we can't open--

385
00:31:46,334 --> 00:31:50,428
-And not seen by cameras.
-Sorry, I forgot to mention that.

386
00:31:50,748 --> 00:31:53,236
Yeah, well, say we do all that...

387
00:31:53,436 --> 00:31:57,890
...we're just supposed to walk out of
there with $1 50 million...

388
00:31:58,092 --> 00:32:00,579
...without getting stopped?

389
00:32:05,353 --> 00:32:06,638
Yeah.

390
00:32:08,805 --> 00:32:11,975
Oh. Okay.

391
00:32:18,877 --> 00:32:22,528
First task: reconnaissance.
I want to know what goes on...

392
00:32:22,728 --> 00:32:25,536
...in all casinos, from
the dealers' rotation...

393
00:32:25,697 --> 00:32:31,476
...to the path of cash carts. I want
to know everything about every guard.

394
00:32:31,676 --> 00:32:33,081
This girl Charmaine...

395
00:32:33,282 --> 00:32:37,655
Find out where they're from,
nicknames, how they take their coffee.

396
00:32:37,896 --> 00:32:40,945
...dances at Crazy Horse Too.
It pays for her school.

397
00:32:41,146 --> 00:32:44,235
-I think she really likes me.
-Cool.

398
00:32:49,412 --> 00:32:52,983
Know these casinos.
They were built to keep people in.

399
00:32:53,184 --> 00:32:54,909
Know the quick routes out.

400
00:32:55,109 --> 00:32:58,560
-He went through at 10:44.
-10:46. Get a watch that works.

401
00:32:58,761 --> 00:33:02,131
-You make me sick, dude. It's 10:44.
-10:46.

402
00:33:06,787 --> 00:33:08,552
Second task: power.

403
00:33:08,993 --> 00:33:12,444
On fight night, we 'll throw
the switch on Sin City.

404
00:33:12,644 --> 00:33:16,295
-Basher, it's your show.
-You want broke, blind or bedlam?

405
00:33:16,497 --> 00:33:19,747
-How about all three?
-Right, it's done.

406
00:33:21,071 --> 00:33:22,837
Third task: surveillance.

407
00:33:23,037 --> 00:33:25,887
Security has an eye
and an ear on everything.

408
00:33:26,086 --> 00:33:28,895
We want an eye and ear on them.
Livingston?

409
00:33:29,096 --> 00:33:32,106
It's not the least accessible
system I've seen.

410
00:33:32,265 --> 00:33:35,678
-There's no closed-circuit to tap into?
-No.

411
00:33:35,877 --> 00:33:40,652
Then it's definitely a black bag job.
They employ an in-house technician?

412
00:33:41,093 --> 00:33:43,742
Two. And one of them is lonely.

413
00:33:57,585 --> 00:34:00,635
Thanks, Charmaine.
I'll return it in an hour.

414
00:34:00,836 --> 00:34:04,969
-Say hi to your mom for me.
-Say it yourself. She's on-stage soon.

415
00:34:27,439 --> 00:34:28,402
Watch it, bud !

416
00:34:28,603 --> 00:34:31,372
-You call me bud, pal?
-You call me pal, friend?

417
00:34:31,571 --> 00:34:35,385
-You call me friend, jackass?
-Don't call me jackass.

418
00:34:35,584 --> 00:34:40,680
433, we have a visual impairment
on the northwest 052 exit-door camera.

419
00:34:41,443 --> 00:34:43,651
Copy that. I see them.

420
00:35:10,774 --> 00:35:15,670
-Is that a word? You made that up?
-" Obsequious" is a word.

421
00:35:25,903 --> 00:35:29,594
-Sir, please move your balloons.
-You got in my way!

422
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:32,764
-I was trying to deliver balloons!
-Gentlemen!

423
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:37,499
-He's a balloon boy! Balloon boy!
-You're spitting in my face.

424
00:35:55,795 --> 00:35:57,320
And we're up and running.

425
00:35:57,964 --> 00:36:03,379
-Why are hallways always that color?
-They say taupe is very soothing.

426
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:08,476
-Hi.
-Fine, thanks.

427
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:21,677
-Move the balloons.
-Move them?

428
00:36:21,878 --> 00:36:26,854
An important client is waiting for
these. I don't have time...

429
00:36:27,054 --> 00:36:29,341
...for you circus animals.

430
00:37:01,482 --> 00:37:03,809
Hey! Hold up a minute!

431
00:37:04,532 --> 00:37:06,136
Excuse me!

432
00:37:06,338 --> 00:37:09,146
Hey! Excuse me!

433
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:14,643
-Hey, you dropped this.
-Oh, thank you.

434
00:37:14,844 --> 00:37:18,014
-How's the reception on those things?
-Excellent.

435
00:37:18,576 --> 00:37:21,505
-Take care.
-Thanks.

436
00:37:27,563 --> 00:37:30,051
-Well....
-Yeah.

437
00:37:32,138 --> 00:37:33,703
Fourth task: construction.

438
00:37:33,903 --> 00:37:37,836
We need to build an exact
replica of the Bellagio vault.

439
00:37:38,077 --> 00:37:40,885
-To practice?
-Something like that.

440
00:37:41,326 --> 00:37:44,858
Fifth task: intelligence.
We need those codes, Linus...

441
00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:47,025
...from the guy who has all three.

442
00:37:47,225 --> 00:37:50,435
-Who, Benedict?
-Learn to love his shadow.

443
00:37:50,637 --> 00:37:55,130
-All I get to do is watch the guy?
-Gotta walk before you crawl.

444
00:37:55,611 --> 00:37:58,862
-Reverse that.
-Sixth task: transport.

445
00:38:02,835 --> 00:38:07,810
Well, I am sorry, but $18,500 a piece
is the best offer that I can make.

446
00:38:08,733 --> 00:38:10,658
Well, I understand.

447
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:15,594
-They are some great-looking vans.
-Yes, sir, top of the line.

448
00:38:16,598 --> 00:38:21,774
-Okay. Thank you for your time, Mr...?
-Denham. Billy Tim Denham.

449
00:38:22,616 --> 00:38:26,830
-Denham like a jean.
-That's it. Just like the jean.

450
00:38:27,953 --> 00:38:31,725
Man, you got some lovely hands here.
Do you moisturize?

451
00:38:31,926 --> 00:38:34,374
-I'm sorry?
-I've tried lots of lotion.

452
00:38:34,573 --> 00:38:38,506
I even went fragrance-free
for a year. Now my sister...

453
00:38:38,706 --> 00:38:42,879
...she uses aloe vera
with a little sunscreen in it.

454
00:38:44,124 --> 00:38:47,373
Ideally, we all should
wear gloves to bed...

455
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:53,313
...but I found there was interference
with my social agenda, you know.

456
00:38:53,714 --> 00:38:58,930
Plus, I react to the camphor. So
I'm not into the traditional remedies.

457
00:38:59,131 --> 00:39:02,501
Let me tell you something.
If you could pay cash...

458
00:39:02,823 --> 00:39:04,908
...l could drop that
down to seven--

459
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,955
Sixteen each.

460
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:09,162
-No?
-Yes, sir.

461
00:39:09,362 --> 00:39:10,968
-You'd do that?
-Yes, sir.

462
00:39:11,288 --> 00:39:13,656
That'd be lovely.
They told me to see you.

463
00:39:14,098 --> 00:39:17,188
-Well, I'm glad they did.
-They told me.

464
00:39:17,387 --> 00:39:22,604
Well, let me go get the paperwork.
You just wait here at the table.

465
00:39:22,805 --> 00:39:24,330
-You do that.
-Thank you.

466
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:35,926
-Very nice material.
-It's imported silk, Saul.

467
00:39:36,728 --> 00:39:38,013
It's very nice.

468
00:39:39,698 --> 00:39:44,352
Gentlemen, would you excuse us
for a second? Thanks.

469
00:39:52,739 --> 00:39:55,868
Saul, you sure you're ready
to do this?

470
00:39:58,998 --> 00:40:02,649
If you ever ask me
that question again, Daniel...

471
00:40:02,851 --> 00:40:05,579
...you won't wake up
the following morning.

472
00:40:09,712 --> 00:40:11,437
He's ready.

473
00:40:15,771 --> 00:40:17,697
My name is Lyman...

474
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:19,462
...Zerga.

475
00:40:20,746 --> 00:40:23,274
My name is Lyman Zerga.

476
00:40:24,919 --> 00:40:28,250
My name is Lyman Zerga.

477
00:40:50,078 --> 00:40:52,406
Okay, tell me about Benedict.

478
00:40:52,606 --> 00:40:53,970
That guy's a machine.

479
00:40:54,172 --> 00:40:55,416
Good afternoon.

480
00:40:55,615 --> 00:40:59,147
He arrives at the Bellagio
every day at 2 p.m.

481
00:40:59,428 --> 00:41:00,831
How are you, Tommy?

482
00:41:01,073 --> 00:41:02,959
He remembers every valet's name.

483
00:41:03,802 --> 00:41:06,450
Not bad for a guy worth
3/4 ofa billion.

484
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:10,181
He works hard, hits the
lobby floor at 7 on the nose.

485
00:41:10,383 --> 00:41:12,428
-Good evening, sir.
-How are you?

486
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:15,678
-Talks with his casino manager.
-About what?

487
00:41:15,879 --> 00:41:16,843
All business.

488
00:41:17,203 --> 00:41:20,615
Benedict likes to know
what's going on. Be in control.

489
00:41:20,815 --> 00:41:25,711
There 's rarely an incident he doesn 't
know about or handle personally.

490
00:41:27,075 --> 00:41:30,646
Spends a few minutes
glad-handing the high rollers.

491
00:41:32,251 --> 00:41:36,985
He speaks Spanish, German and ltalian
and is getting good at Japanese.

492
00:41:38,912 --> 00:41:42,202
He 's out by 7:30
and is handed a black portfolio.

493
00:41:42,523 --> 00:41:47,458
Contents: profits and new security
codes. He heads to the restaurant.

494
00:41:53,236 --> 00:41:55,283
Like I said, a machine.

495
00:41:55,643 --> 00:41:58,934
That portfolio contains
codes to all the cage doors?

496
00:41:59,135 --> 00:42:02,666
And two minutes after they' re changed,
he's got them.

497
00:42:03,951 --> 00:42:08,725
You guys really can pick them.
This guy's as smart as he is ruthless.

498
00:42:08,925 --> 00:42:13,139
Last guy he caught cheating,
he not only sent up for 10 years...

499
00:42:13,339 --> 00:42:16,028
...he seized his house and
bankrupted his--

500
00:42:16,269 --> 00:42:17,714
In-law's dealership.

501
00:42:17,954 --> 00:42:22,328
He takes out your knees and ruins
your life and anybody you know.

502
00:42:22,528 --> 00:42:23,893
You scared?

503
00:42:24,213 --> 00:42:25,778
You suicidal?

504
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:29,069
Only in the morning.

505
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:31,636
-Now what?
-Now comes the girl.

506
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:35,689
She comes down after him
if they' re in a snit.

507
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:40,264
-Where does she come from?
-The museum, there. She's the curator.

508
00:42:42,029 --> 00:42:43,474
Here she is.

509
00:42:44,918 --> 00:42:47,606
This is the best part of my day.

510
00:43:00,608 --> 00:43:04,861
I'm not sure we can use her yet.
I haven't even caught her name.

511
00:43:05,061 --> 00:43:06,787
Tess.

512
00:43:07,068 --> 00:43:08,874
Huh?

513
00:43:09,073 --> 00:43:10,680
Her name is Tess.

514
00:43:32,748 --> 00:43:34,995
-We have to talk. Now.
-Okay.

515
00:43:39,328 --> 00:43:42,820
Tell me this is not about her
or I walk off the job.

516
00:43:43,141 --> 00:43:44,544
Who?

517
00:43:44,866 --> 00:43:47,555
Tess. Benedict.
Tell me this isn't about...

518
00:43:47,755 --> 00:43:50,684
-...the guy who's screwing your wife.
-Ex-wife.

519
00:43:50,885 --> 00:43:53,213
-Tell me.
-It's not about that.

520
00:43:55,780 --> 00:44:00,435
It's not entirely about that.
Remember when we got in this business?

521
00:44:00,636 --> 00:44:03,765
We said we'd play
like we had nothing to lose.

522
00:44:03,966 --> 00:44:05,691
Well, I lost something.

523
00:44:06,494 --> 00:44:10,346
I lost someone.
That's why I'm here.

524
00:44:15,081 --> 00:44:18,170
The problem is,
now we're stealing two things.

525
00:44:18,372 --> 00:44:22,464
And if you can't have both,
which do you choose?

526
00:44:22,664 --> 00:44:25,394
Remember, Tess does not split 1 1 ways.

527
00:44:25,714 --> 00:44:31,090
If everything goes to plan, I won't be
the one that has to make that choice.

528
00:44:35,625 --> 00:44:37,993
-How'd she look?
-She looked good.

529
00:44:38,194 --> 00:44:39,477
Thanks.

530
00:45:09,732 --> 00:45:10,976
You like it?

531
00:45:12,982 --> 00:45:15,430
I like that you like it.

532
00:45:18,439 --> 00:45:20,406
-I'll see you tonight?
-Okay.

533
00:45:27,508 --> 00:45:30,758
In my hotel, there's always
somebody watching.

534
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:33,648
I'll see you tonight.

535
00:45:47,652 --> 00:45:49,697
Weak stomach, Mr. Zerga?

536
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:54,191
I don't believe in weakness.
It costs too much.

537
00:45:54,592 --> 00:45:56,960
I don't believe in questions either.

538
00:45:57,161 --> 00:46:00,291
Oh, really? Well then,
let me give you a tip.

539
00:46:00,612 --> 00:46:04,022
Don't get into Terry Benedict
for too much money.

540
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:06,069
He doesn't fool around.

541
00:46:06,268 --> 00:46:08,156
-How are you, Eddie?
-Fine, sir.

542
00:46:08,355 --> 00:46:09,639
Anything for me?

543
00:46:09,841 --> 00:46:14,094
Mr. Lyman Zerga. Third position.
Wants to talk to you privately.

544
00:46:16,059 --> 00:46:17,344
Who is he?

545
00:46:17,545 --> 00:46:20,353
Businessman of some kind,
from Europe.

546
00:46:20,514 --> 00:46:24,727
Very vague. I asked around.
Word is, he deals primarily in arms.

547
00:46:25,089 --> 00:46:26,894
-One of the biggest.
-Zerga.

548
00:46:27,095 --> 00:46:28,699
Yes, sir.

549
00:46:29,101 --> 00:46:32,551
-Never heard of him.
-That's why I don't doubt it.

550
00:46:32,752 --> 00:46:36,444
-He's staying here?
-He's in the Mirador suite.

551
00:46:36,765 --> 00:46:40,256
-How's he doing?
-Up, almost 200.

552
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,586
Good for him.

553
00:46:57,711 --> 00:47:02,164
You're 30 seconds late.
I was about to send out a search....

554
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:05,054
Hello, Tess.

555
00:47:06,537 --> 00:47:08,062
What are you doing here?

556
00:47:09,306 --> 00:47:10,511
I'm out.

557
00:47:11,073 --> 00:47:12,356
-Out?
-Of prison.

558
00:47:12,517 --> 00:47:15,727
Remember? I went for cigarettes
and didn't come back.

559
00:47:15,927 --> 00:47:18,656
I don't smoke. Don't sit.

560
00:47:19,178 --> 00:47:24,234
-Supposedly I paid my debt to society.
-Funny, I never got a check.

561
00:47:24,796 --> 00:47:26,802
You're not wearing your ring.

562
00:47:27,644 --> 00:47:31,496
I sold it. I don't have a husband
or didn't you get the papers?

563
00:47:31,698 --> 00:47:35,188
-My last day inside.
-I told you I'd write.

564
00:47:38,197 --> 00:47:42,972
-Danny, go now before--
-What? Benedict?

565
00:47:44,136 --> 00:47:46,986
How you doing? Whiskey and whiskey.

566
00:47:48,389 --> 00:47:52,763
You're doing a great job at the museum.
The Vermeer is quite good.

567
00:47:52,964 --> 00:47:56,856
-Vibrant. But his work fell off later.
-Remind you of anyone?

568
00:47:57,056 --> 00:48:01,832
I always confuse Monet and Manet.
Which one married his mistress?

569
00:48:02,192 --> 00:48:04,320
-Monet.
-And Manet had syphilis.

570
00:48:04,841 --> 00:48:07,128
They also painted occasionally.

571
00:48:10,819 --> 00:48:13,187
All right, I'll make this quick.

572
00:48:13,388 --> 00:48:15,154
I came here for you.

573
00:48:16,839 --> 00:48:20,209
I want to get on with my life.
I want you with me.

574
00:48:20,811 --> 00:48:22,577
You're a thief and a liar.

575
00:48:23,178 --> 00:48:26,268
I lied about being a thief.
I don't do that now.

576
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:28,194
-Steal?
-Lie.

577
00:48:28,395 --> 00:48:31,323
I'm with someone who
doesn't have to make...

578
00:48:31,525 --> 00:48:34,534
-...that kind of distinction.
-He's clear on both.

579
00:48:35,016 --> 00:48:37,022
-You have a problem.
-Only one?

580
00:48:37,263 --> 00:48:42,278
You've met too many people like you.
I'm with Terry now.

581
00:48:45,086 --> 00:48:47,454
Does he make you laugh?

582
00:48:49,019 --> 00:48:51,869
He doesn't make me cry.

583
00:49:03,625 --> 00:49:08,441
-The fight is Saturday night?
-Yes, would you like tickets?

584
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:12,252
No. Hand-to-hand combat
does not interest me.

585
00:49:12,453 --> 00:49:15,783
I have a package arriving
here that evening.

586
00:49:16,345 --> 00:49:18,753
A black briefcase, standard size...

587
00:49:19,314 --> 00:49:23,326
...the contents of which
is very valuable to me.

588
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:26,336
I'll put it in the house safe.

589
00:49:26,537 --> 00:49:30,430
The house safe is for brandy
and grandmother's pearls.

590
00:49:31,472 --> 00:49:35,886
-I need something more secure.
-Mr. Zerga, I can assure you our--

591
00:49:36,087 --> 00:49:40,781
I can assure you, Mr. Benedict,
that your generosity in this matter...

592
00:49:40,942 --> 00:49:43,711
...will not go overlooked.

593
00:49:43,912 --> 00:49:49,529
Now, what can you offer me
besides the safe?

594
00:49:50,211 --> 00:49:54,666
People you steal from have insurance.
They get made whole again.

595
00:49:54,947 --> 00:49:59,561
I left New York to escape what
happened. Can I get five years back?

596
00:49:59,761 --> 00:50:03,774
-What you can do is not throw--
-You don't know anything.

597
00:50:03,974 --> 00:50:07,546
You don't love me,
you're with someone else, fine.

598
00:50:07,746 --> 00:50:10,555
I have to live with that.
But not him.

599
00:50:11,357 --> 00:50:13,003
Just like an ex-husband.

600
00:50:13,163 --> 00:50:15,490
-I'm not joking.
-I'm not laughing.

601
00:50:15,692 --> 00:50:18,500
There's a conflict of interest
when you...

602
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:23,636
-...give me advice about my love life.
-But that doesn't mean I'm wrong.

603
00:50:25,963 --> 00:50:28,811
Do you remember what I said
when we first met?

604
00:50:29,575 --> 00:50:33,988
-That I better know what I'm doing.
-Do you? Now?

605
00:50:34,831 --> 00:50:36,436
You should go if you don't.

606
00:50:36,838 --> 00:50:38,321
I know what I'm doing.

607
00:50:38,523 --> 00:50:39,806
What are you doing?

608
00:50:41,412 --> 00:50:43,017
Just catching up.

609
00:50:43,338 --> 00:50:45,584
-Meet my ex-husband.
-Danny Ocean.

610
00:50:45,785 --> 00:50:48,273
-Mr. Ocean.
-I'm in your seat.

611
00:50:48,915 --> 00:50:52,245
Forgive my lateness.
A guest required my attention.

612
00:50:52,447 --> 00:50:56,579
That's fine. Danny was walking
through and spotted me.

613
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:58,746
-Is that so?
-Imagine the odds.

614
00:50:58,946 --> 00:51:01,715
" Of all the gin joints
in all the world."

615
00:51:01,875 --> 00:51:04,404
You recently were
released from prison?

616
00:51:04,604 --> 00:51:05,568
That's right.

617
00:51:05,768 --> 00:51:08,737
-How does it feel to be out?
-About the same.

618
00:51:09,901 --> 00:51:14,354
-Danny was just about to--
-I just stopped by to say hi to Tess.

619
00:51:14,556 --> 00:51:15,719
Stay, have a drink.

620
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,565
-I can't.
-He can't.

621
00:51:21,457 --> 00:51:23,343
Well, then....

622
00:51:24,386 --> 00:51:27,436
I imagine we won't see
Mr. Ocean anytime soon.

623
00:51:27,637 --> 00:51:29,041
You never know.

624
00:51:29,201 --> 00:51:32,130
I know everything
happening in my hotels.

625
00:51:32,451 --> 00:51:34,979
So I should put
those towels back.

626
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:37,548
No, the towels you can keep.

627
00:51:42,604 --> 00:51:45,211
-Good to see you, Tess.
-Take care, Danny.

628
00:51:45,413 --> 00:51:47,500
-Terry.
-Danny.

629
00:53:09,796 --> 00:53:10,920
Stinking....

630
00:53:11,121 --> 00:53:12,566
Tomorrow the day is yours.

631
00:53:14,171 --> 00:53:17,060
Call is at 5:30, makeup and costume.

632
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:20,912
Saul's package arrives at 7:05.
Linus grabs our codes.

633
00:53:21,232 --> 00:53:26,007
All goes well, we're a go. At 7:30,
Yen is locked in and we're committed.

634
00:53:26,329 --> 00:53:31,304
From this point, we have 30 minutes
to blow the power or he suffocates.

635
00:53:44,586 --> 00:53:48,117
Once the electricity goes,
access to the vault...

636
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:52,891
...and its elevator shut down for
two minutes. That's when we go.

637
00:53:56,744 --> 00:54:00,677
You're in the middle of the
room, 10 feet from everything.

638
00:54:00,917 --> 00:54:04,568
You have to get to the door
without touching the floor.

639
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:06,333
What do you do?

640
00:54:06,816 --> 00:54:09,704
-Ten says he shorts it.
-Twenty.

641
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:18,974
Window or aisle, boys?

642
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,344
Yeah, we're in deep shit.

643
00:54:22,666 --> 00:54:26,196
That poxy demo crew
didn't back the main line.

644
00:54:26,517 --> 00:54:29,447
They naused up the mainframe.
Naused it up!

645
00:54:30,129 --> 00:54:32,656
-You understand him?
-I'll explain later.

646
00:54:33,017 --> 00:54:37,070
They' re so pony they blew the
backup grids one by one.

647
00:54:37,271 --> 00:54:38,755
Basher, what happened?

648
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:42,487
They did what I would have done
but by accident.

649
00:54:42,648 --> 00:54:46,098
Now they know their weakness,
they're fixing it.

650
00:54:46,781 --> 00:54:51,073
So unless we intend to do this job
in Reno, we're in Barney.

651
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:55,287
Barney Rubble. Trouble!

652
00:54:58,979 --> 00:55:01,466
-We could always--
-By tomorrow?

653
00:55:02,349 --> 00:55:05,881
Hang on a minute, hang on.
We could use a pinch.

654
00:55:08,127 --> 00:55:10,294
What's a pinch?

655
00:55:10,816 --> 00:55:15,149
A device which creates a cardiac
arrest for broadband circuitry.

656
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:18,761
Better yet, a pinch is a
bomb without the bomb.

657
00:55:18,962 --> 00:55:22,935
When a nuclear weapon detonates,
its electromagnetic pulse...

658
00:55:23,134 --> 00:55:26,224
...shuts down any power source
within its blast radius.

659
00:55:26,424 --> 00:55:31,159
It usually doesn't matter because a
nuclear weapon destroys everything.

660
00:55:31,482 --> 00:55:34,771
A pinch creates a similar
electromagnetic pulse...

661
00:55:34,971 --> 00:55:39,225
...without mass destruction and death.
Instead of Hiroshima you get...

662
00:55:39,385 --> 00:55:41,753
-...the 1 7th century.
-How long?

663
00:55:41,954 --> 00:55:42,997
30 seconds.

664
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:47,932
Could a pinch knock out
the power of an entire city?

665
00:55:48,133 --> 00:55:50,982
-Like, for instance--
-Las Vegas?

666
00:55:53,148 --> 00:55:54,874
Yeah, I think it might.

667
00:55:55,235 --> 00:55:58,325
There's only one pinch
big enough to do it.

668
00:55:58,525 --> 00:55:59,608
Where?

669
00:56:12,289 --> 00:56:14,495
Let's go. Yen, Basher, come on.

670
00:56:14,978 --> 00:56:16,261
Where you going?

671
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:18,146
-I'm coming with you.
-No.

672
00:56:18,348 --> 00:56:21,558
Oh, no, no, no!
Don't leave me with these guys!

673
00:56:30,626 --> 00:56:31,549
Start.

674
00:56:31,749 --> 00:56:33,876
-I got one.
-You thinking of one?

675
00:56:34,197 --> 00:56:37,408
-No, I've thought of one.
-You're thinking of one.

676
00:56:37,567 --> 00:56:39,574
No, I'm done. I have it.

677
00:56:39,775 --> 00:56:41,219
-You a man?
-Yes. 1 9.

678
00:56:41,419 --> 00:56:42,784
-You alive?
-Yes. 18.

679
00:56:42,944 --> 00:56:45,312
-Evel Knievel.
-Shit!

680
00:56:45,553 --> 00:56:47,158
-Don't touch me.
-I'm not.

681
00:56:47,358 --> 00:56:49,847
-Your hand's in my face.
-It's not.

682
00:56:50,047 --> 00:56:52,855
-Am I touching you?
-Your hand's in my face.

683
00:56:53,056 --> 00:56:54,782
-Move.
-I didn't touch you.

684
00:56:54,942 --> 00:56:57,911
-You just touched me.
-You made me touch you.

685
00:56:58,113 --> 00:57:00,680
This is your side.
This is your side.

686
00:57:01,924 --> 00:57:03,890
Get off. Get off.

687
00:57:30,775 --> 00:57:33,463
I'm gonna need a score of
car batteries--

688
00:57:33,664 --> 00:57:36,834
Where's Linus? Where's Linus?

689
00:57:44,979 --> 00:57:48,310
-There he is.
-Oh, would you look at this doughnut?

690
00:57:59,786 --> 00:58:01,390
Should someone help him?

691
00:58:01,591 --> 00:58:05,523
That's a great idea, Albert.
Let's all get nicked.

692
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:11,783
Back it up.

693
00:58:28,234 --> 00:58:29,639
Let him in.

694
00:58:36,861 --> 00:58:39,109
You stupid bastard !

695
00:58:44,485 --> 00:58:46,532
-I say stay, you stay.
-Got it.

696
00:58:46,733 --> 00:58:49,822
Lose focus for one second,
somebody gets hurt!

697
00:58:50,023 --> 00:58:51,388
I got it.

698
00:58:55,559 --> 00:58:57,205
Where are they?

699
00:58:57,927 --> 00:59:01,258
That's what I want to know.
Where the hell are they?

700
00:59:01,459 --> 00:59:05,111
-They will be here.
-"They will be here." Schmuck!

701
00:59:12,454 --> 00:59:14,339
You boys have a nice trip?

702
00:59:25,013 --> 00:59:26,457
We have a problem.

703
00:59:27,421 --> 00:59:29,266
You've been red-flagged.

704
00:59:29,466 --> 00:59:33,158
The moment you enter the casino,
they'll be watching.

705
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:37,291
Like hawks. Hawks with video cameras.

706
00:59:39,016 --> 00:59:40,782
That's a problem.

707
00:59:40,982 --> 00:59:43,631
-Saul, turn that off.
-When I'm ready--

708
00:59:43,832 --> 00:59:47,082
-Saul !
-It's off! It's off!

709
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:51,575
Any idea how this happened?

710
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:54,385
-No.
-Oh, come on.

711
00:59:54,545 --> 00:59:59,241
He's been chasing Benedict's girl.
They had an argument two nights ago.

712
01:00:00,403 --> 01:00:02,410
-I tailed you.
-Who told you to?

713
01:00:02,611 --> 01:00:05,580
I did. I worried you couldn't
leave Tess alone.

714
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:06,984
-Tess?
-My wife.

715
01:00:07,184 --> 01:00:09,552
-Ex-wife.
-Tess is here?

716
01:00:10,917 --> 01:00:15,089
I'm sorry. I didn't know if it
would sting you, but it did.

717
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:17,216
-You're out, Danny.
-He's out?

718
01:00:17,417 --> 01:00:20,907
Or we call it off.
His involvement puts us at risk.

719
01:00:21,109 --> 01:00:25,121
-It's not your call.
-You put her before us and made it mine.

720
01:00:25,322 --> 01:00:27,047
This is my job.

721
01:00:27,488 --> 01:00:28,491
Not anymore.

722
01:00:28,693 --> 01:00:31,983
He can't just be out.
Who's gonna trigger the vault?

723
01:00:32,183 --> 01:00:33,909
Kid, you up for it?

724
01:00:39,446 --> 01:00:40,770
I can do it.

725
01:00:41,090 --> 01:00:44,622
Done. Locate the others.
Tell them the change in plan.

726
01:00:44,822 --> 01:00:46,428
Curtain goes up at 7.

727
01:00:46,628 --> 01:00:51,404
Tess is with Benedict now?
She's too tall for him.

728
01:00:52,768 --> 01:00:55,015
Yes. No.

729
01:00:56,419 --> 01:00:58,064
Very much no.

730
01:01:00,231 --> 01:01:05,809
Then inform Mr. Levin he'll be better
off watching the fight at home on TV.

731
01:01:06,009 --> 01:01:09,701
Surely, he must have HBO.
That's it.

732
01:01:14,114 --> 01:01:15,238
Hi.

733
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:19,892
What were you thinking about?

734
01:01:21,056 --> 01:01:22,260
You.

735
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:27,476
Where you gonna put your hands?

736
01:01:30,045 --> 01:01:31,449
No good.

737
01:01:33,134 --> 01:01:35,501
Don't touch your tie. Look at me.

738
01:01:35,703 --> 01:01:39,033
You need to answer my question.
Where do you look?

739
01:01:39,233 --> 01:01:44,048
No. Look down, they know you're lying.
Up, and you don't know the truth.

740
01:01:44,249 --> 01:01:46,897
Don't use seven words if four will do.

741
01:01:47,098 --> 01:01:52,314
Be specific, but not memorable.
Be funny, but don't make him laugh.

742
01:01:52,515 --> 01:01:56,167
He's got to like you,
then forget you once you leave.

743
01:01:56,366 --> 01:01:59,336
And, for God's sake,
whatever you do, don't--

744
01:01:59,537 --> 01:02:01,704
Russ! Can you take a look at this?

745
01:02:01,904 --> 01:02:03,269
Sure.

746
01:02:19,159 --> 01:02:20,563
Saul?

747
01:02:25,538 --> 01:02:26,942
It's time.

748
01:02:44,639 --> 01:02:46,083
Okay.

749
01:02:46,364 --> 01:02:47,728
Let's do it.

750
01:02:50,939 --> 01:02:53,667
On a perfectly clear night
in Las Vegas...

751
01:02:53,867 --> 01:02:57,759
... with the expected crowd of
celebrities and sports fans...

752
01:02:57,961 --> 01:03:02,735
...piling into the MGM Grand, the two
best heavyweights in the world...

753
01:03:02,936 --> 01:03:08,633
...prepare to meet after an
eight-month dance toward each other.

754
01:03:11,001 --> 01:03:12,365
Mr. Zerga?

755
01:03:12,807 --> 01:03:14,451
Mr. Benedict.

756
01:03:14,652 --> 01:03:19,669
-I'm very busy. Are we on schedule?
-I have no reason to suspect otherwise.

757
01:03:20,189 --> 01:03:23,881
My courier should be here momentarily.

758
01:03:43,703 --> 01:03:47,154
Eighteen. Blackjack!

759
01:04:00,677 --> 01:04:04,248
Find Mr. Walsh. Tell him Mr. Ocean
is in the west slots.

760
01:04:05,934 --> 01:04:10,146
I can't have private security personnel
in the casino cages.

761
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:11,671
Of course not.

762
01:04:13,116 --> 01:04:15,964
Saul! Saul Bloom, is that you?

763
01:04:16,165 --> 01:04:19,334
Saul! Saul, it's me! Bucky Buchanan!

764
01:04:19,536 --> 01:04:21,783
Remember? From Saratoga!

765
01:04:25,674 --> 01:04:27,120
Mikael. Vladimir.

766
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:30,811
Hey! Hey, Saul! Saul !

767
01:04:32,777 --> 01:04:34,221
Mr. Benedict, please.

768
01:04:34,423 --> 01:04:38,555
I have never enjoyed the touch
of steel to my skin.

769
01:04:45,497 --> 01:04:47,262
Lift them up, please.

770
01:04:55,328 --> 01:04:59,942
I acknowledge your briefcase contains
nothing dangerous or illicit.

771
01:05:00,143 --> 01:05:03,875
I agree to take said briefcase
and store it in my vault...

772
01:05:04,075 --> 01:05:05,961
...for a period of 24 hours.

773
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:09,692
-I cannot allow you into the vault.
-Why not?

774
01:05:09,894 --> 01:05:15,190
Insurance, for one. Security. But,
most of all, I just don't trust you.

775
01:05:16,474 --> 01:05:17,758
Excuse me.

776
01:05:21,851 --> 01:05:26,024
I put two plainclothes on Ocean.
He's in the keno bar now.

777
01:05:26,224 --> 01:05:29,916
Mr. Zerga, this is my
casino manager, Mr. Walsh.

778
01:05:30,117 --> 01:05:34,370
He will have your briefcase stored
in our vault while you watch.

779
01:05:34,531 --> 01:05:36,899
Those are my terms. Yes or no?

780
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:40,872
You leave me no choice.

781
01:05:44,241 --> 01:05:46,890
Dude, don't do that in
front of the pinch.

782
01:06:29,745 --> 01:06:32,834
Deep breaths. You 'll do fine.

783
01:06:33,034 --> 01:06:35,523
-Thank you.
-No sweat. You 're a natural.

784
01:06:35,722 --> 01:06:37,849
But don 't screw up.

785
01:06:44,711 --> 01:06:47,519
-Who gets the penne?
-Right here.

786
01:06:53,258 --> 01:06:54,461
You ready?

787
01:06:56,587 --> 01:07:00,962
This is our security center,
where we oversee the casino and vault.

788
01:07:01,162 --> 01:07:03,811
You'll monitor your briefcase
from here.

789
01:07:03,972 --> 01:07:05,496
Don't let me keep you.

790
01:07:05,696 --> 01:07:08,345
-Mr. Zerga.
-Mr. Benedict.

791
01:07:14,163 --> 01:07:15,768
Linus, you're up.

792
01:07:17,052 --> 01:07:18,176
Got him.

793
01:07:18,537 --> 01:07:19,942
Mr. Benedict.

794
01:07:20,743 --> 01:07:23,552
Sheldon Willis,
Nevada Gaming Commission.

795
01:07:23,753 --> 01:07:26,121
I need two minutes of your time.

796
01:07:27,324 --> 01:07:29,210
-Anything for the NGC.
-Thanks.

797
01:07:29,451 --> 01:07:32,180
Will you accompany me
to pit five, please?

798
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:53,125
-You make the deposit when?
-At your signal.

799
01:07:53,326 --> 01:07:57,177
What do we look like,
a couple of peckerwood jackasses?

800
01:07:58,502 --> 01:08:00,669
How does that feel?
You all right?

801
01:08:00,869 --> 01:08:03,518
Want something to read?
A magazine?

802
01:08:03,719 --> 01:08:05,604
All right. Counting down.

803
01:08:05,965 --> 01:08:09,135
Thirty minutes of
breathing time starts now.

804
01:08:09,778 --> 01:08:12,345
This just came to our attention today.

805
01:08:12,546 --> 01:08:15,515
Apparently, he's got
a record longer than my....

806
01:08:16,438 --> 01:08:17,922
It's long.

807
01:08:21,614 --> 01:08:23,862
If he is who you say he is.

808
01:08:28,837 --> 01:08:31,004
You been at the commission long?

809
01:08:31,566 --> 01:08:35,457
-About 18 months.
-You know Hal Lindley? Worked with him?

810
01:08:37,384 --> 01:08:39,711
Not since he died last year.

811
01:08:43,563 --> 01:08:47,817
Ramon Escalante? Sheldon Willis,
Nevada Gaming Commission.

812
01:08:48,018 --> 01:08:49,622
What's going on here?

813
01:08:49,822 --> 01:08:54,197
-It's come to our attention--
-We should speak off the floor.

814
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:56,003
Charlie.

815
01:09:17,389 --> 01:09:18,753
Thank you.

816
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:23,850
-No. I want you out of here.
-Give me one moment.

817
01:09:24,131 --> 01:09:27,502
-I've had it. I want you gone.
-Tess, come here.

818
01:09:27,701 --> 01:09:29,387
You're up to something.

819
01:09:29,547 --> 01:09:33,520
Don't say you're here for me.
You're pulling a job, aren't you?

820
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:36,971
Well, no matter what it is,
you won't win me back.

821
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:39,699
Tess, I just came to say goodbye.

822
01:09:46,601 --> 01:09:47,884
Goodbye.

823
01:10:01,647 --> 01:10:03,212
You be good.

824
01:10:13,485 --> 01:10:16,373
-Mr. Ocean.
-Mr. Benedict wishes to see you.

825
01:10:16,856 --> 01:10:18,500
I thought he might.

826
01:10:20,105 --> 01:10:24,680
Good afternoon, Mr. Escalante.
Or should I call you Mr. Catton?

827
01:10:26,004 --> 01:10:29,575
You're Frank Catton, of
the Tropicana, the Desert lnn...

828
01:10:29,776 --> 01:10:33,868
...and the New York State
Penitentiary system. Are you not?

829
01:10:35,955 --> 01:10:39,486
I take it from your silence
you won't refute that.

830
01:10:39,968 --> 01:10:43,780
Mr. Benedict, you're employing
an ex-convict. As you know--

831
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:45,144
Goddamn cracker.

832
01:10:48,114 --> 01:10:50,561
-Excuse me?
-You heard me.

833
01:10:50,763 --> 01:10:53,571
Black man can't earn a decent wage?

834
01:10:53,771 --> 01:10:57,062
-You wanna throw me on the street.
-I'm doing my job.

835
01:10:57,422 --> 01:10:59,990
Want me to get on the table and dance?

836
01:11:00,191 --> 01:11:02,518
Shine your shoes? Smile at you?

837
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:08,016
You sure won't let me deal the cards.
You might as well call it whitejack!

838
01:11:10,384 --> 01:11:15,199
I don't know what to say to that.
Race has nothing to do with it.

839
01:11:15,398 --> 01:11:18,769
-Yeah, right.
-What a horrible thing to say!

840
01:11:20,214 --> 01:11:25,871
You, of all people, know the NGC has
always supported hiring colored--

841
01:11:26,394 --> 01:11:29,965
-No! I didn't mean it!
-Okay. Come on, sit down.

842
01:11:30,848 --> 01:11:32,975
-Sit down.
-You better talk to him.

843
01:11:33,616 --> 01:11:35,903
-He's got it.
-Sit down.

844
01:11:36,104 --> 01:11:38,752
Virgil. Turk. Deliver the package.

845
01:11:50,429 --> 01:11:52,355
-Where's your card?
-I lost it.

846
01:11:52,555 --> 01:11:54,281
-You serious?
-I'm so stupid.

847
01:11:54,481 --> 01:11:57,089
-You are so stupid! You know that?
-Hey!

848
01:11:57,331 --> 01:12:00,941
You think it helps to call someone
names who's upset?

849
01:12:01,143 --> 01:12:04,753
-Hey! IKeep it down.
-Sorry. Sorry.

850
01:12:04,915 --> 01:12:08,446
-Where did this come from?
-High roller's room.

851
01:12:08,645 --> 01:12:12,057
-It's Mr. Benedict's stuff.
-Joe, take this inside.

852
01:12:12,257 --> 01:12:15,828
-Count room?
-No, to the vault.

853
01:12:16,029 --> 01:12:18,397
Benedict's money goes in the vault.

854
01:12:18,597 --> 01:12:22,970
Next time, remember the card,
and we won't run into this again.

855
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:25,138
-Stupid.
-Jeez!

856
01:12:31,719 --> 01:12:33,645
Yo! Hold that, please.

857
01:12:35,289 --> 01:12:40,105
-There's your briefcase now, Mr. Zerga.
-Wonderful.

858
01:12:45,843 --> 01:12:47,408
That's my cue.

859
01:12:48,410 --> 01:12:50,296
Give Basher the go.

860
01:12:51,219 --> 01:12:52,824
Bash, what's your status?

861
01:12:53,025 --> 01:12:56,395
-Bash!
-Easy. No need to shout, guv' ner.

862
01:12:56,596 --> 01:12:59,445
-What's your status?
-I'm nearly there.

863
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:18,424
Come on, come on.

864
01:13:19,427 --> 01:13:23,280
Mr. Walsh, show this man
off the premises.

865
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:26,370
Don't ever set foot
in my casino again.

866
01:13:26,570 --> 01:13:27,814
Sir?

867
01:13:29,018 --> 01:13:31,024
-Cracker!
-Oh, dear God !

868
01:13:38,969 --> 01:13:43,343
Oh! I forgot my pager.
I left it. Sorry.

869
01:13:44,868 --> 01:13:46,351
-Know the way back?
-I do.

870
01:13:46,553 --> 01:13:47,636
Good.

871
01:13:48,157 --> 01:13:50,003
Okay. Enjoy the fight.

872
01:13:51,087 --> 01:13:52,652
Sorry!

873
01:13:57,948 --> 01:14:01,440
How much longer you figure
Mr. Benedict's gonna be?

874
01:14:10,748 --> 01:14:13,517
No cameras in this room, huh?

875
01:14:14,922 --> 01:14:16,286
Yeah.

876
01:14:17,730 --> 01:14:20,820
Don't want anybody seeing
what goes on in here.

877
01:14:23,429 --> 01:14:25,515
He's not coming, is he?

878
01:14:35,667 --> 01:14:39,399
We're gonna step outside.
Leave you two to talk things over.

879
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:46,099
I hadn't seen my wife in three weeks,
so I decided to call her.

880
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:50,072
"I love you, you love me."
"I miss you, you miss me."

881
01:14:50,232 --> 01:14:53,443
That went well, but then
I went to this party....

882
01:14:57,495 --> 01:15:00,664
I show up at 1 p.m.
She expected me at 1 1 a.m...

883
01:15:00,826 --> 01:15:04,557
...so she was going crazy.
I said, "What do you expect?

884
01:15:04,759 --> 01:15:08,289
What do you think goes on?
It's not choir practice."

885
01:15:08,610 --> 01:15:10,174
Oh, shit.

886
01:15:13,264 --> 01:15:15,472
Does that satisfy you, Mr. Zerga?

887
01:15:15,671 --> 01:15:19,123
I am very satisfied.

888
01:15:21,651 --> 01:15:26,425
-Are you all right, sir?
-I'm fine. I'm fine.

889
01:15:28,352 --> 01:15:29,716
All right.

890
01:15:34,130 --> 01:15:35,574
Jesus!

891
01:15:36,939 --> 01:15:38,342
Bruiser!

892
01:15:38,544 --> 01:15:42,797
-Not until later!
-Sorry, Danny. I forgot.

893
01:15:42,998 --> 01:15:44,483
It's all right.

894
01:15:46,128 --> 01:15:48,896
-How's your wife?
-Pregnant again.

895
01:15:49,137 --> 01:15:53,270
Well, it happens.
Let's get started. Come here.

896
01:16:21,117 --> 01:16:24,408
-You're almost there, Linus.
-Who's that guy?

897
01:16:25,009 --> 01:16:27,738
-I got a bogey in west corridor.
-Mr. Zerga!

898
01:16:31,589 --> 01:16:35,201
-Call a doctor! Mr. Zerga!
-Put this under his head.

899
01:16:35,402 --> 01:16:38,291
Going to video now.

900
01:16:38,491 --> 01:16:40,698
--to the Eye in the Sky ASAP.

901
01:16:40,899 --> 01:16:43,387
We have a man down
who's unconscious.

902
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:55,705
Oh, Jesus!

903
01:16:56,869 --> 01:17:01,163
-Did you really think I'd sit this out?
-You didn't trust me?

904
01:17:01,363 --> 01:17:02,767
I do now.

905
01:17:03,450 --> 01:17:04,854
Come on.

906
01:17:33,344 --> 01:17:35,390
Someone call for a doctor?

907
01:17:44,057 --> 01:17:47,829
-How'd you get here?
-Had to give a friend two million.

908
01:17:48,070 --> 01:17:52,643
But what about Rusty? The argument?
I mean, what was that about?

909
01:17:54,208 --> 01:17:58,462
Come on. Why not just tell me?
Why put me through all this?

910
01:17:58,663 --> 01:18:01,793
Where's the fun in that?
Let's get going.

911
01:18:02,474 --> 01:18:05,243
Come on, man! Breathe!

912
01:18:05,605 --> 01:18:07,931
Breathe, damn it! Breathe!

913
01:18:13,510 --> 01:18:17,362
I'm sorry. We've lost him.

914
01:18:18,846 --> 01:18:22,337
-Dude, I told you to hurry.
-Don't do that. Just don't.

915
01:18:22,538 --> 01:18:24,384
I didn't tell you to hurry?

916
01:18:25,186 --> 01:18:27,955
Come on, get up! Get up!

917
01:18:33,090 --> 01:18:34,856
Had enough yet?

918
01:18:59,494 --> 01:19:03,426
-These things are gonna hold us, right?
-They should.

919
01:19:18,633 --> 01:19:20,479
Livingston, we're set.

920
01:19:21,162 --> 01:19:24,010
-Livingston, we're set.
-Basher, we're set.

921
01:19:24,853 --> 01:19:26,980
Hang on a minute, chief.

922
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:29,829
We don 't have one.
Yen 's gonna suffocate.

923
01:19:29,989 --> 01:19:32,878
Then you should
leave off bothering me, okay?

924
01:20:28,452 --> 01:20:30,338
All right, crack them.

925
01:20:40,008 --> 01:20:41,413
Go.

926
01:20:47,753 --> 01:20:49,197
Shit!

927
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:51,363
Cut it.

928
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:16,563
Hey!

929
01:21:18,449 --> 01:21:21,258
Pit six, table five.
Dealers compromised.

930
01:21:21,459 --> 01:21:24,869
Trade's breached at tables three,
five, six and ten.

931
01:21:35,984 --> 01:21:38,632
Get your coat. Get your coat.

932
01:21:39,235 --> 01:21:41,401
Look, this is crazy! What...?

933
01:22:21,848 --> 01:22:23,693
Not yet. Not yet.

934
01:22:28,830 --> 01:22:30,275
Go ahead.

935
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:36,173
-You think Yen made it out okay?
-I'm sure he'll be fine.

936
01:22:37,496 --> 01:22:38,901
How we doing?

937
01:22:39,864 --> 01:22:42,552
Okay, I guess.

938
01:22:58,642 --> 01:23:03,257
There's a 95-pound Chinese man
with $1 60 million behind this door.

939
01:23:03,458 --> 01:23:05,585
-Let's get him out.
-Yeah.

940
01:23:15,777 --> 01:23:17,984
-10 says he shorts it.
-No bet.

941
01:23:18,184 --> 01:23:19,829
Try him again.

942
01:23:50,165 --> 01:23:51,609
Okay.

943
01:23:58,510 --> 01:24:00,717
Hey. Where we at, boys?

944
01:24:00,919 --> 01:24:04,811
-Pins and floor sensors, now.
-Blinding.

945
01:24:11,190 --> 01:24:12,796
Here we go.

946
01:24:20,901 --> 01:24:23,950
Counting down from 20. Now.

947
01:24:24,151 --> 01:24:25,475
Twenty...

948
01:24:28,164 --> 01:24:32,136
-Don't blow the door. Can you read me?
-Ten...

949
01:24:32,417 --> 01:24:34,263
...nine, eight...

950
01:24:34,423 --> 01:24:38,476
-Maybe the pinch blew out his earwigs.
-Do not blow the door!

951
01:24:40,522 --> 01:24:43,210
...two, one.

952
01:24:51,036 --> 01:24:52,240
What's wrong?

953
01:24:52,439 --> 01:24:53,884
Something....

954
01:25:06,043 --> 01:25:08,409
Did you check the batteries?

955
01:25:10,376 --> 01:25:13,707
You know, lose focus
in this game for one second--

956
01:25:13,906 --> 01:25:17,960
I know, somebody gets hurt.
You don't hear Yen complaining.

957
01:25:37,741 --> 01:25:39,146
Yen?

958
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:48,857
Where the fuck you been?

959
01:25:51,385 --> 01:25:53,109
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

960
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:06,994
That is the sexiest thing
I've ever seen.

961
01:26:10,164 --> 01:26:11,447
Rusty, you're up.

962
01:26:22,441 --> 01:26:25,973
-You gonna answer that?
-I don't have a cell phone.

963
01:26:29,905 --> 01:26:31,510
This isn't mine.

964
01:26:33,155 --> 01:26:34,761
See who it is.

965
01:26:36,687 --> 01:26:39,535
-Hello?
-May I have a word with Mr. Benedict?

966
01:26:39,736 --> 01:26:41,181
It's for you.

967
01:26:45,635 --> 01:26:49,085
-Who the hell is this?
-The man who 's robbing you.

968
01:26:53,860 --> 01:26:58,957
-What's going on in the vault?
-Nothing, sir. It's all normal.

969
01:26:59,156 --> 01:27:00,601
Show me.

970
01:27:02,487 --> 01:27:05,496
-You're mistaken.
-Watching your monitors?

971
01:27:05,657 --> 01:27:07,945
Okay, keep watching.

972
01:27:17,294 --> 01:27:20,222
In this town,
luck can change that quickly.

973
01:27:20,424 --> 01:27:23,714
-Find out how much money's down there.
-Yes, sir.

974
01:27:39,965 --> 01:27:41,289
Tess?

975
01:27:41,931 --> 01:27:43,416
Tess?

976
01:27:44,298 --> 01:27:45,983
Perhaps you should....

977
01:27:46,344 --> 01:27:48,150
Perhaps I should what?

978
01:27:48,993 --> 01:27:52,765
It would be better if you weren't
around here for this.

979
01:28:00,349 --> 01:28:02,957
All right, you proved your point.

980
01:28:03,157 --> 01:28:08,053
You broke into my vault.
Congratulations. You're a dead man.

981
01:28:08,253 --> 01:28:12,868
-Maybe.
-Maybe? May I ask how you will leave?

982
01:28:13,229 --> 01:28:16,881
You think I'll let you
take my money out my casino doors?

983
01:28:17,081 --> 01:28:21,014
-No. You'll carry it out for us.
-Why would I do that?

984
01:28:21,213 --> 01:28:22,819
Look at your monitor.

985
01:28:24,464 --> 01:28:28,918
As your manager's probably reporting,
you have over $ 160 million...

986
01:28:29,119 --> 01:28:33,051
...in your vault tonight.
We 're only packing up half that.

987
01:28:33,252 --> 01:28:37,304
The other half we 're leaving,
booby-trapped, as a hostage.

988
01:28:37,626 --> 01:28:41,638
You let our $80 million go,
and you get to keep yours.

989
01:28:41,839 --> 01:28:45,329
You try and stop us,
we'll blow both cashloads.

990
01:28:48,941 --> 01:28:54,679
You can lose $80 million secretly
or lose $1 60 million publicly.

991
01:28:54,879 --> 01:28:56,123
Your decision. Hi.

992
01:29:07,037 --> 01:29:08,562
Make the call.

993
01:29:13,699 --> 01:29:15,424
91 1 emergency response.

994
01:29:16,868 --> 01:29:19,636
-Where's Danny?
-He's fine. He's in good form.

995
01:29:19,838 --> 01:29:23,489
-He asks that you go up and watch TV.
-He does?

996
01:29:23,930 --> 01:29:28,505
We have three men with explosives
who have taken control of our vault.

997
01:29:31,193 --> 01:29:33,240
-Okay.
-It's alright, Tess.

998
01:29:33,481 --> 01:29:35,326
-You have a deal.
-I promise.

999
01:29:35,527 --> 01:29:37,894
Fantastic. Here's what you do:

1000
01:29:39,299 --> 01:29:42,991
The guys in the vault will put
six bags in the elevator.

1001
01:29:43,190 --> 01:29:44,996
It will rise to your cages.

1002
01:29:45,198 --> 01:29:49,210
Three of your guards will carry
the bags out into the casino.

1003
01:29:49,611 --> 01:29:54,908
If they take more than 20 seconds to
reach the floor, or there's a switch...

1004
01:29:55,108 --> 01:29:57,596
...we'll blow all the money.

1005
01:29:59,281 --> 01:30:02,491
-He's in the casino by the slots.
-Of course I am.

1006
01:30:02,692 --> 01:30:07,948
I'm staying in your hotel.
I have two words for you: mini bar.

1007
01:30:09,915 --> 01:30:12,122
Once the guards
hit the casino floor...

1008
01:30:12,323 --> 01:30:17,498
...a white van will pull up outside.
Your guards will load the rear.

1009
01:30:17,698 --> 01:30:22,755
If anyone so much as approaches the
driver's door, we 'll blow everything.

1010
01:30:24,119 --> 01:30:28,694
When I hear the van is away and
the money secure, my men will leave.

1011
01:30:28,894 --> 01:30:32,345
Once their safety is confirmed,
you 'll get your vault.

1012
01:30:32,907 --> 01:30:34,753
The S.W.A.T. team is here.

1013
01:30:36,277 --> 01:30:37,802
All right.

1014
01:30:38,002 --> 01:30:42,979
Now, I have complied with your
every request. Would you agree?

1015
01:30:43,178 --> 01:30:44,463
I would.

1016
01:30:44,905 --> 01:30:47,673
Good. Because now
I have one of my own:

1017
01:30:48,436 --> 01:30:52,087
Run and hide, asshole. Run and hide.

1018
01:30:52,287 --> 01:30:57,103
If you're picked up buying a $100,000
sports car in Newport Beach...

1019
01:30:57,304 --> 01:31:02,399
...l'll be disappointed. I want my
people to find you, and when they do...

1020
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:06,212
...rest assured, we won't
hand you over to the police.

1021
01:31:06,411 --> 01:31:11,026
So, my advice to you again
is this: run and hide.

1022
01:31:11,709 --> 01:31:13,956
That is all that I ask.

1023
01:31:35,462 --> 01:31:39,837
Mr. Benedict, our guys say that
van is headed for McCarran Airport.

1024
01:31:40,037 --> 01:31:43,487
I want my vault
back before that van hits the tarmac.

1025
01:31:53,439 --> 01:31:55,967
Night goggles on.
Prepare to cut power.

1026
01:31:59,338 --> 01:32:00,541
Ready.

1027
01:32:03,230 --> 01:32:04,996
Cutting power now.

1028
01:32:07,242 --> 01:32:08,366
Do it.

1029
01:32:10,091 --> 01:32:12,338
Breaching elevator doors now.

1030
01:32:12,941 --> 01:32:16,230
We have two guards,
bound, unconscious.

1031
01:32:16,792 --> 01:32:17,955
Wait a minute.

1032
01:32:18,157 --> 01:32:19,963
Guys! Guys!
Someone 's here!

1033
01:32:20,162 --> 01:32:22,530
-Take him down, now!
-I got him!

1034
01:32:24,216 --> 01:32:27,225
-Lights! We need power now!
-Give it to him.

1035
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:40,146
What's going on?
Talk to me.

1036
01:32:40,346 --> 01:32:44,359
It appears an explosive incendiary
device has been detonated.

1037
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:48,131
Continuing search for survivors.

1038
01:32:48,331 --> 01:32:51,060
Tell them to take the van.
I'll be there.

1039
01:32:51,260 --> 01:32:54,230
And find out how they
hooked into my system!

1040
01:32:54,430 --> 01:32:55,915
Yes, sir.

1041
01:33:13,491 --> 01:33:16,700
Get out of the van, now. Now!

1042
01:33:21,033 --> 01:33:22,719
Tires. Tires.

1043
01:33:38,890 --> 01:33:40,935
Our search yielded no suspects.

1044
01:33:41,137 --> 01:33:45,069
Nor can we determine how they
entered or exited the premises.

1045
01:33:47,637 --> 01:33:50,325
-Take your men out.
-May I suggest you--?

1046
01:33:50,527 --> 01:33:51,970
Now.

1047
01:33:52,251 --> 01:33:55,221
It's your vault.
Blue team, move it out!

1048
01:34:03,447 --> 01:34:05,654
Walsh, where are we with the van?

1049
01:34:23,188 --> 01:34:25,998
I just want to try
something for a second.

1050
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:29,489
There's nobody inside.

1051
01:34:31,053 --> 01:34:35,828
-I'm sorry. Did you want to get in?
-Enough monkey business.

1052
01:34:36,028 --> 01:34:37,594
Do it already.

1053
01:34:52,321 --> 01:34:55,410
Mr. Benedict.
We took the van, sir.

1054
01:34:55,610 --> 01:34:56,573
And?

1055
01:34:56,773 --> 01:34:59,984
They say there was no
money in the bags, sir.

1056
01:35:00,144 --> 01:35:01,669
What do you mean?

1057
01:35:01,910 --> 01:35:06,404
They say the bags were filled
with fliers, sir. For hookers.

1058
01:35:12,462 --> 01:35:13,546
Walsh?

1059
01:35:14,069 --> 01:35:16,435
Cue up the tape to the robbery.

1060
01:35:18,121 --> 01:35:20,529
Yes, sir. I'm looking at the tape now.

1061
01:35:21,331 --> 01:35:24,701
Does it say "Bellagio "
on the vault floor?

1062
01:35:24,902 --> 01:35:27,390
No, it doesn't.
I don't understand.

1063
01:35:29,677 --> 01:35:31,563
We had it installed Tuesday.

1064
01:35:31,763 --> 01:35:35,215
The images we saw of those
men robbing us was a tape.

1065
01:35:35,536 --> 01:35:36,739
What?

1066
01:35:38,705 --> 01:35:42,397
It was staged.
Somebody made a duplicate of my vault.

1067
01:35:42,597 --> 01:35:46,570
What we saw on the monitor
wasn't actually happening.

1068
01:35:47,573 --> 01:35:51,304
I don 't understand.
What happened to all that money?

1069
01:36:01,416 --> 01:36:02,701
Make the call.

1070
01:36:10,003 --> 01:36:11,929
91 1 emergency response.

1071
01:36:15,540 --> 01:36:17,587
-Night goggles on.
-Clear.

1072
01:36:17,787 --> 01:36:19,191
Prepare to cut power.

1073
01:36:24,128 --> 01:36:26,535
Breaching elevator doors now.

1074
01:36:26,937 --> 01:36:30,026
We have two guards,
bound, unconscious.

1075
01:36:30,226 --> 01:36:31,310
Wait a minute.

1076
01:36:31,511 --> 01:36:33,236
Guys! Guys!
Someone's here!

1077
01:36:33,517 --> 01:36:36,165
-Take him down, now!
-I got him!

1078
01:37:22,872 --> 01:37:23,955
Open the door.

1079
01:37:30,015 --> 01:37:33,826
Hey, Benedict.
How's the other fight going?

1080
01:37:39,283 --> 01:37:40,366
Pick him up.

1081
01:37:49,235 --> 01:37:51,080
Did you have a hand in this?

1082
01:37:52,244 --> 01:37:54,530
Did I have my hand in what?

1083
01:37:58,944 --> 01:38:00,911
I'll ask you one more time.

1084
01:38:01,111 --> 01:38:03,318
Did you have your hand in this?

1085
01:38:06,087 --> 01:38:09,938
Benedict, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1086
01:38:14,152 --> 01:38:15,557
Okay.

1087
01:38:16,761 --> 01:38:18,485
You're free to go.

1088
01:38:20,572 --> 01:38:22,217
Show him out.

1089
01:38:28,597 --> 01:38:31,126
-Hello.
-Turn to channel 88.

1090
01:38:31,326 --> 01:38:33,012
Who is this?

1091
01:38:41,679 --> 01:38:44,287
What happened, Benedict?
You get robbed?

1092
01:38:44,487 --> 01:38:45,932
Stop.

1093
01:38:56,484 --> 01:38:58,812
I'll give you one last chance.

1094
01:38:59,896 --> 01:39:01,059
Where 's my money?

1095
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:04,109
What ifl said you could
get your money back...

1096
01:39:05,152 --> 01:39:07,078
...if you 'd give up Tess?

1097
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:09,525
What would you say?

1098
01:39:12,415 --> 01:39:13,538
I would say yes.

1099
01:39:18,394 --> 01:39:19,638
All right.

1100
01:39:21,563 --> 01:39:24,413
I know a guy.
We were in the joint together.

1101
01:39:24,613 --> 01:39:28,786
Anybody pulls anyjob in the
Western U. S., he knows about it.

1102
01:39:29,309 --> 01:39:33,160
Give me 72 hours, I'll find
out who took your money.

1103
01:39:37,373 --> 01:39:39,339
You know a guy.

1104
01:39:41,948 --> 01:39:46,682
Contact the police. I'm sure he's
in violation of his parole.

1105
01:39:46,843 --> 01:39:48,288
Yes, sir.

1106
01:40:13,085 --> 01:40:14,529
Tess.

1107
01:40:16,375 --> 01:40:17,820
Tess.

1108
01:40:18,461 --> 01:40:20,869
You of all people should know, Terry.

1109
01:40:21,070 --> 01:40:24,761
In your hotel,
there's always someone watching.

1110
01:42:01,103 --> 01:42:02,589
Wait!

1111
01:42:03,391 --> 01:42:04,674
Wait!

1112
01:42:06,079 --> 01:42:08,927
Wait, that's my husband !

1113
01:42:12,219 --> 01:42:15,509
-Danny.
-Tess, I told you...

1114
01:42:16,673 --> 01:42:18,598
...l knew what I was doing.

1115
01:42:19,441 --> 01:42:20,926
I didn't.

1116
01:42:21,126 --> 01:42:22,812
All right, let's go.

1117
01:42:23,976 --> 01:42:25,701
How long will you be?

1118
01:42:25,901 --> 01:42:28,310
About three to six months, I guess.

1119
01:45:16,677 --> 01:45:18,523
I hope you were the groom.

1120
01:45:21,612 --> 01:45:25,183
Ted Nugent called,
he wants his shirt back.

1121
01:45:32,527 --> 01:45:36,739
Thirteen million and you drive
this piece of shit to pick me up?

1122
01:45:36,940 --> 01:45:38,706
I blew it all on the suit.

1123
01:45:38,906 --> 01:45:42,919
-Where are they?
-Back row, silver sedan. Ten o'clock.

1124
01:45:43,119 --> 01:45:46,730
I picked up your personal
effects. Hope you don't mind.

1125
01:45:49,138 --> 01:45:51,506
I'm not sure these belong to me.

1126
01:46:02,018 --> 01:46:03,423
-Hi.
-Hi.

1127
01:46:03,624 --> 01:46:04,907
Rusty needs a girl.

1128
01:46:05,108 --> 01:46:07,837
There's a women's
prison down the road.

1129
01:46:09,362 --> 01:46:11,287
You said that you sold this.

1130
01:46:11,489 --> 01:46:13,093
I said that.

1131
01:46:13,334 --> 01:46:14,739
Liar.

1132
01:46:16,384 --> 01:46:17,747
Thief.

1133
01:46:18,305 --> 01:47:18,350
