1
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,790
What's with this island?

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,670
Oh, no! They started shooting already!

3
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,630
Duck!

4
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,260
Oh, crap!

5
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,070
I have a plan!

6
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,740
Which will kill Straw Hat Luffy!

7
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:54,790
And which will exterminate the Straw Hats!

8
00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:01,570
I think you all remember the day
Straw Hat rampaged through the Navy HQ.

9
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:06,890
That was certainly an incident
that symbolized the Great Pirate Era.

10
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,920
Once again, make sure to engrave the faces of the enemies

11
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,030
that disturb our peace into your minds!

12
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,190
The swordsman, "Pirate Hunter" Zoro!

13
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:21,880
The navigator, "Cat Burglar" Nami!

14
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:28,210
The sniper, "King of Snipers" Sniper King!

15
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:33,020
The cook, "Black-Foot" Sanji!

16
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,360
Whoa! You surprised me!

17
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,380
I just felt somebody laughing at me!

18
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,090
The archeologist, "Demon Child" Nico Robin!

19
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,100
The shipwright, "Cyborg" Franky!

20
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:52,100
The musician, "Humming Swordsman" Brook!

21
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:56,350
The ship doctor,
"Cotton Candy Lover" Chopper!

22
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,720
Lastly, although he's a pirate,
he's Vice Admiral Garp's grandson!

23
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,180
The Revolutionary Dragon's son!

24
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:10,160
The captain, "Straw Hat" Luffy!

25
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:15,480
Those nine are our enemies!

26
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,900
I have a plan! I see a chance for victory!

27
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,130
"Straw Hat Destruction Maneuver."

28
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,240
STRAW HAT DESTRUCTION MANEUVER

29
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,240
Commence!

30
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,480
Yes, sir!

31
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:32,540
ADVENTURE OF NEBULANDIA

32
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,750
I'm hungry!

33
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,880
Sanji! Food!

34
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,710
Meat! Meat! No vegetables!

35
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:44,670
You're so damn annoying!
Wait a minute!

36
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,490
Hungry! Hungry! I'm hungry!

37
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,000
Found one! I found a coconut!

38
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,090
Let me see.

39
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,170
How did you find it?!

40
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:08,360
It's a nice distance.

41
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:10,870
All right!

42
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,150
Usopp-san won!

43
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,170
Yes!

44
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,510
Damn! I won't lose the next one!

45
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,360
Okay!

46
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,010
Oh, no...

47
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,110
Thanks!

48
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,930
Franky! You've lost three in a row!

49
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,350
Shut up!

50
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:37,350
Why are you two betting
without asking! Boy!

51
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,270
Oh, an empty bottle this time!

52
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,310
Great! I'll get it again!

53
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,920
That's my line!

54
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,070
Where is it?

55
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,860
It's in the direction of that
odd-shaped island. Oh?

56
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,120
What's wrong?

57
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,290
I see something blinking. A signal?

58
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,430
--What's the matter?
--A signal?

59
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,350
That's an SOS.

60
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,040
Huh? What?

61
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,480
Seems like there's a distress signal
from the island.

62
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,430
What's with the island?!
There are a bunch of mushrooms!

63
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,680
Can I eat them?

64
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,860
You're so quick!

65
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:17,490
Does it mean somebody's there? Who is it?

66
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:18,910
Wait a sec.

67
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,900
There's a ship. It's stranded.

68
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,220
A crowd on the beach...

69
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,920
They're all women!

70
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,590
--Oh?!
--Women!

71
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,860
Sanji! Weren't you cooking meat?

72
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,790
Here you go.

73
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,470
Anyway, what should we do?

74
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,230
What should we do? Of course, we...

75
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,210
...as decent humans, can't turn our backs!

76
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,810
Sanji! You're bleeding from your nose.

77
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,130
So we're gonna stop by the island?

78
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,570
Well, we have no choice.

79
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,700
Wait, wait!

80
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:55,210
How could you decide it without asking us!
What if it messes up the Log Pose?

81
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:59,270
I can just repair their ship quickly
before it gathers too many logs.

82
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:03,250
Alright. It's fine, then.
But make sure to charge them for the repair.

83
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,090
--You're...
--That's my Nami!

84
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,990
What do you say, Captain?

85
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:12,570
No problem! The island looks delicious.

86
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:16,780
Nami-san! Starboard helm and full speed!

87
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,850
Alright, alright.

88
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:23,520
Ladies, wait there!
Your knight is on his way!

89
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,420
I'm the one who'll repair the ship!

90
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,310
I hope I can eat some mushrooms.

91
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,060
It's a beautiful island!

92
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:42,770
It's normally deserted.
Nature remains untouched here.

93
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,780
Hey, are you all right?

94
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,530
We received your SOS signal!

95
00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:00,430
I'm a shipwright!
I'll repair your ship so hold on!

96
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:03,620
It's a big mushroom! Yum-yum!

97
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,750
Don't eat it!
Until I find out if it's edible or not.

98
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,050
I'm practically immune to poison!

99
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:15,080
I said don't! There are some poisons
that'll cause changes to your body!

100
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,020
They're really all women!

101
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,410
Is anybody hurt? I'm a doctor!

102
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,280
That ship...
I think I remember it from somewhere...

103
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,420
And the memories are bad...

104
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,820
You're in good hands now, girls!

105
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,600
My nouvelle cuisine will help you!

106
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:44,730
Boy, I'll leave them behind
if the Log Pose starts to get affected.

107
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,280
Some of those people aren't women!

108
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,930
Huh? Looks like they're all women to me!

109
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:06,230
Only the ones up front are women!
Behind them are...

110
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,610
That's what I'd expect from
Black-Foot the woman chaser!

111
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:12,840
Who are you?!

112
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:18,000
It's been a while, Straw Hats!

113
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,120
I wanted to see you guys
so I looked and looked and...

114
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,270
...looked all over for you!

115
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,790
What's with that big-headed woman?

116
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,690
Chopper?

117
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:32,960
--Oh!
--Why is he here in the New World?!

118
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,940
Yes, it's me!
The captain of the Foxy Pirates,

119
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,550
"Silver Fox" Foxy-sama!

120
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,590
Ooh!

121
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:58,530
Everyone, remove your make-up!

122
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,020
We came to avenge ourselves on you
for humiliating us!

123
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,310
Can't speak from astonishment?

124
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,310
Wait, who are you?

125
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,880
He doesn't remember me...

126
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,190
Boss!

127
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:20,720
Oh no, Boss, cheer up!
How dare you pretend that you don't remember!

128
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,680
No, I really don't know.

129
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,870
Hey, Hamburg! It's not funny!

130
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,560
Do you know him?

131
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:35,570
Ah, he's from that thing.
The Davy Back Fight. Remember?

132
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,260
Davy... Oh!

133
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:41,570
We did the pirate game
before we got to Water Seven!

134
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,660
Now you remember?! You dullard!

135
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:46,720
Yeah, I remember!
If I'm correct, your name is...

136
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,520
...Split-Head Fox-taro!

137
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,690
Okay! You got it all wrong!

138
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:55,420
It's been a long time!
I'm glad that you're doing fine... Um...

139
00:08:55,420 --> 00:09:00,400
I'm Foxy! Don't forget!
We fought so fiercely!

140
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:05,680
This time we're being treated to
a captain-versus-captain battle!

141
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:09,250
Silver Fox Foxy!

142
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,870
Straw Hat Luffy!

143
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,540
I'm... the real deal!

144
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,090
It's dragging me away!

145
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,170
Dear me! Whatever's the matter?

146
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,500
That's already settled!

147
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,840
Yeah, you're right! Damn right!

148
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:42,400
But I can't just let it go
since you stopped my undefeated streak!

149
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:48,260
We're totally different from
the Foxy Pirates we used to be!

150
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,060
Your head got split even more?

151
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,910
Uh-huh... No way!

152
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,060
Boss!

153
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:58,250
Screw you!
You fooled me with crap like that?!

154
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,820
We learned about your personality inside and out
in the last battle.

155
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,700
We thought it'd be a piece of cake
with our beautiful ladies.

156
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,960
It's called...

157
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:11,120
BEAUTIFUL LADY MANIPULATION MANEUVER

158
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,600
..."Beautiful Lady Manipulation Maneuver"!

159
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:15,420
Because you're an idiot,
it went exactly as we planned.

160
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,690
Shut up!

161
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,130
I see! It was an incredible plan!

162
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,840
Hey, Usopp, you fool!

163
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,380
Sanji!

164
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,510
All right! It's my bad!

165
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:29,330
But was it worth wrecking your ship?

166
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:35,710
I already told you.
We're different from the way we used to be.

167
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:38,110
--Dojaku!
--Okay, Boss!

168
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:44,590
The all-new Foxy Pirates!
Show them the brand-new Foxy that suits us!

169
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:45,660
Got it!

170
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:27,620
It's completely transformed!
The Sexy Foxy!

171
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,640
What exactly did you do
to change it like that?!

172
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,830
Cool! Cool!

173
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,050
Isn't it?

174
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:34,970
Listen to me!

175
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,420
So stupid!

176
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,190
It's been a long time since the last time
we saw that Jolly Roger.

177
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,230
That drawing stinks!

178
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,320
You drew it!

179
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:52,330
I've never forgotten about it
even for a day or a second!

180
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:57,330
I jumped into this New World
using the frustration from losing you as a springboard!

181
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:00,190
Scraped together some
very powerful crew members!

182
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,360
Through Davy Back Fights?

183
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:07,880
That's right!
I just got an incredible guy the other day!

184
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:12,680
Let me introduce him!
He's a shipwright who rebuilt the ship beautifully!

185
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:17,490
A true artisan! "Gimmick" Dojaku!

186
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:22,690
Hmmm, I kind of like your work.

187
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,690
What an honor to be praised by you, Franky.

188
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,900
Well, you know, I'm a genius so...

189
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,740
In addition, let me introduce our military tactician
who worked out the plan to bring you here!

190
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,750
He's a super strategist!

191
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:58,100
All you Straw Hats!
Nice to meet you!

192
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:02,660
I'm Komei from the Foxy Pirates!

193
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:11,150
People call me "White Feather" Komei!
I'm pleased to make your acquaintance!

194
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:14,100
He doesn't look like a military tactician.

195
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,230
But his humor definitely matches
Foxy's people.

196
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:23,460
Believe or not,
Komei used to be in the Navy!

197
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,960
The Navy?

198
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,310
How is that possible?!
Why did a Navy man become a pirate?!

199
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,990
Because I defeated him in a Davy Back Fight!

200
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:35,040
Well, but still...

201
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,450
Rules are meant to be followed.

202
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,790
I was in the Navy but I've always been
a man of the sea at the same time.

203
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:47,440
When you accept a challenge and lose,
you must join the other crew with good grace.

204
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:55,160
Is that something to say proudly?
So stupid!

205
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,990
We still have more and more incredible guys
so look forward to meeting them!

206
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:04,290
Now, there's only one reason I lured you here!
You know what it is, don't you?

207
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:09,250
A rematch of a Davy Back Fight!
Of course, you'll accept it, won't you?!

208
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:19,310
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

209
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,790
It's getting interesting.

210
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:26,710
You've got to be kidding!
Luffy, don't accept it!

211
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:28,430
That's impossible.

212
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:32,550
A man can't turn his back
in a situation like this.

213
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:37,010
Boy!
Why are pirates such a bunch of idiots?!

214
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,070
But it sounds like fun.

215
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:57,680
Well, we know what kind of tricks they use
so I don't think we'll lose any this time.

216
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:03,890
TAKOYAKI

217
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,600
Keep going! Keep going!

218
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:19,280
--Can I get 50 pieces of okonomiyaki?
--Okay!

219
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,780
Here! Here!
Would you like some frankfurters?

220
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,660
L-O-V-E Boss!

221
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:29,380
--Would you like to have more? Free refill!
--Oh, thanks.

222
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,730
They're totally having a good time already.

223
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:34,940
The vibe is awesome! I love it!

224
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,990
By the way, what's that Davy thing?

225
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:43,130
You don't know?
It's an old game between two pirate crews.

226
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,810
The winner can pick out a crew member
from the loser's crew.

227
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:53,820
Chopper was freaking out
because he was forced to join them once.

228
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:57,840
--But you guys won it, didn't you?
--Yeah.

229
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,090
Did you take somebody from their crew?

230
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:03,260
No, what we took was their Jolly Roger.
Their symbol.

231
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:07,500
To make up for it, Luffy drew that but...

232
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,920
There!

233
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,690
FOX

234
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,790
This sucks...!

235
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,420
I feel sorry for them.

236
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,480
Hm? What's wrong?

237
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,000
Davy Back is a pirate game, right?

238
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,370
Why would a Navy man accept such a thing?

239
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,490
You're right...

240
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:23,660
I have a bad feeling.

241
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:27,340
Want some? These are the special-edition
souvenirs from the Davy Back!

242
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,370
Oh, nice! I want some!

243
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,650
Hey! Don't buy crap like that!

244
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,880
Cool! He's really a robot!

245
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,510
Robot? No, cyborg.

246
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,880
Cool! A robot language!

247
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,430
Super!

248
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,160
You, too! What are you doing?!

249
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:45,850
Okay! As always, it's time for the pledge to follow
these three rules about losing!

250
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:50,870
First, the only way to take back
anything you lose in a Davy Back Fight,

251
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,420
is through another Davy Back Fight.

252
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:59,400
Second, anyone taken by the winner
must swear loyalty to that ship's captain.

253
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:04,470
Third, if your Jolly Roger is taken,
you can't ever display it again!

254
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:08,530
If you break these rules, you'll be considered
dishonorable pirates

255
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:11,890
and sent to Davy Jones' Locker!

256
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,230
Do you swear to uphold these rules?

257
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,940
I swear.

258
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,420
I shwear.

259
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:24,040
Okay! Then, I hereby announce this Three-Coin Game
to be played by standard rules!

260
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:28,420
All right! It finally begins!

261
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:32,750
The Foxy Pirates' revenge match!
A Davy Back Fight!

262
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:36,860
Our boss lost his first battle after 920 straight victories
to this redoubtable man,

263
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,570
Straw Hat Luffy!

264
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:42,760
However, after that,
he has been winning battle after battle!

265
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,850
I'm sure it's gonna be a good match again!
Now, the much-anticipated first round!

266
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:54,330
The eating contest!
The food is mushrooms harvested from this island!

267
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,610
Oh, couldn't be luckier! I get to eat!

268
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,300
Never seen those... Is it okay?

269
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,220
I guess. I'm practically immune to poison.

270
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,530
Maybe they'll blow up when you eat them.

271
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:09,540
Don't eat them!
I can't find that mushroom anywhere!

272
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,620
Hey! Is it really safe?

273
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,940
It is. Right?

274
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:18,980
It's a new type of mushroom which has been
discovered recently but it's not poisonous.

275
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,090
Don't worry.

276
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:23,800
Okay! Let me introduce
the members of both teams!

277
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,320
First, the Straw Hat team!

278
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,550
The captain, Luffy! The cook, Sanji!
The musician, Brook!

279
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,460
So stupid.

280
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,920
If I win, Nami-san,

281
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,810
--let me see your panties...
--I won't, you idiot!

282
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,610
The contender -
the Foxy team's members are...

283
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:42,510
..."Four-Footed Dash Freak" Hamburg!

284
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,180
Count on me!

285
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:47,010
The genius shipwright, Dojaku!

286
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:52,330
And the only girl competing in this round,
our idol, Porche-chan!

287
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,750
Ooh! Thank you for your support!

288
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:00,920
Now, I'll explain the rules
but it's quite simple.

289
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:06,380
Three members on each team.
Which one can eat more mushrooms?

290
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,180
It's a three-minute match.

291
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,220
Both teams have the same amount -
we measured properly.

292
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,450
Will you be okay, Big Sis?

293
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:16,560
Oh, no!
I'm a big eater even though I don't look like it.

294
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:19,420
Hmmm, they're grilled beautifully.

295
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,520
I can eat all of them even on my own!

296
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:29,160
You can count on me, too.
My stomach is actually like a bottomless pit.

297
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:33,700
Having said that,
I don't really have a stomach now though!

298
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,280
You got me there!

299
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,200
Objection!

300
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:39,810
Komei?

301
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:43,170
The Straw Hat team's
selection of members isn't fair.

302
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:46,450
Huh? What? You have an objection
about the decision, you ex-Navy?

303
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:47,430
That's right!

304
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:52,200
Since it's an eating contest,
the competitors must have a stomach!

305
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,830
Brook the musician,
I think I must blow my whistle on you!

306
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,480
Oh, you're right!

307
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,670
Oh, you're right!

308
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:05,490
No, do you agree to it?!
They have to do it just the two of them, then!

309
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,300
I can do it on my own!

310
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:11,720
Idiot! Anything could happen!
Do you forget what happened the last time?!

311
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,240
We almost lost Chopper to them!

312
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:20,400
Hey! It hasn't started yet! We'll accept his complaint
so allow us to change a member!

313
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,840
Don't be ridiculous!
"No change allowed in competitors" is in the rules, fool!

314
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:31,260
Well, it's okay. Let's allow it.

315
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:35,870
They'll accept the complaint
so let's make an exception.

316
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,100
Who will fill his shoes?!

317
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:43,340
Why is that newcomer going
over our boss' head?!

318
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,800
Usopp.

319
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,770
I don't know what the other games will be like

320
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:52,050
but the only one among us who eats as much as Luffy is him!

321
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,990
Zoro! Can you do it?!

322
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,870
I have no choice. Damn!

323
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,460
Let's just do it already!

324
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,900
I'm sorry.

325
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:11,450
No problem at all.
I was just getting tired of drinking.

326
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:17,620
Usopp subbed in a useless lump!
We don't need the moss ball pickled in sake.

327
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:22,130
I bet he became anxious because our pervert cook
keeps having nosebleeds.

328
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,860
Cut it out, you two!

329
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:31,190
Okay! We have all members from both teams again!
It'll finally start!

330
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,670
Oh, what is it?

331
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:38,680
Oops. Seems like we forgot to mention
one more rule.

332
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:43,590
It says "No one except for the competitors is
allowed to climb up on the stage."

333
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:48,170
"If someone does it,
that team forfeits at that moment!"

334
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:49,860
Was there such a rule?

335
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,550
Whatever! Just start already!

336
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:54,910
All right! The first round starts now!

337
00:21:55,950 --> 00:22:01,410
It began! The fateful revenge match!
Who will win this thing?!

338
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:05,480
Oh, by the way,
I, Itomimizu, am your host...

339
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:09,300
Oh, the Straw Hat team is in top gear already!

340
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,300
Seems like they're swallowing down
the mushrooms!

341
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,460
Can't believe how they eat!

342
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,720
Now, the opponent, the Foxy team is...

343
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,680
Oh? Huh?!

344
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,350
Dojaku isn't doing anything!
What is he doing?!

345
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,150
Hey, why aren't you eating?!

346
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,250
I have a plan.

347
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:30,960
I'll make it up all at once later. Just wait.

348
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,450
Hamburg?!

349
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,890
Whoa...
What's wrong with you suddenly?! Hey!

350
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:44,470
Wh-What is going on?

351
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:49,980
The Straw Hat team, too!
All of them stopped eating!

352
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:52,420
Luffy! Zoro! Sanji!

353
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,700
Is it poison?!

354
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:58,870
Hamburg! Stay with me!
What happened to you?

355
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,790
Hey... Say something...

356
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:07,250
I can't believe it!
Everybody who was eating the mushrooms collapsed!

357
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,690
Chopper! Meds!

358
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:12,760
No! If I can't figure out what kind of poison it is,
I can't neutralize it!

359
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:15,050
Damn! Let's go closer to them!

360
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,070
Uh-huh!

361
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,760
No, wait!

362
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,680
What?!

363
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,410
If you climb up on the stage, you people lose.

364
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:26,440
--Hey! This is not time to argue about it!
--It's an emergency!

365
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,400
The rule is the rule.

366
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,480
Is he nuts?!

367
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:34,840
Boss! Let's call off the Davy Back Fight!

368
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,090
Y-Yeah...

369
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:39,410
Oh? Do you want to call off the fight
that's already been started?

370
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:42,060
Shut up! Your crewmates are suffering!

371
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:45,980
In the first place, you came up with the eating contest!

372
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,520
How will you take the responsibility for it?!

373
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,050
I told you they're not poisonous.
They won't die.

374
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:56,320
Then, how do you explain what's going on
on that stage?!

375
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,180
Well, just watch what happens. Dojaku!

376
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,240
--Okay!
--What?

377
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,470
D-Dojaku?

378
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:16,440
Oh! The two from the Foxy team are
getting up!

379
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,780
All of the Straw Hat team are
already sitting up, too!

380
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,370
--Luffy!
--Are they alright?

381
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:27,750
Luffy! Zoro! Sanji! Are you conscious?!
Feeling numb somewhere in your body?!

382
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,650
Feeling nauseous?!

383
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,440
I feel sick...

384
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,370
Feeling sick?! What else?!

385
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:37,520
At least, you're up so this will do!

386
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,110
What are you trying to make someone
who got food poisoning eat?!

387
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:42,370
Eat this and perk up!

388
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:49,940
Don't wanna it.

389
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,520
--Luffy?!
--What did he just say?

390
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:59,610
Oh? What? Straw Hat doesn't look good.
It's not just my imagination, is it?

391
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,300
--I don't wanna move.
--I'll stay still.

392
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,080
Huh?! So are they?!

393
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,260
Oh, no...

394
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:11,040
So are our executives!
What's going on?!

395
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,610
--What happened?!
--It doesn't look like them.

396
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:16,980
Don't tell me it's because of that mushroom?

397
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,670
That's right!

398
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,820
Komei, you...

399
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,410
Oh? He's gone.

400
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:24,900
I'm up here.

401
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:29,770
--When did you get there?!
--Soldiers value speed above quality.

402
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:33,400
How was it?
What an amazing tactic! It's called...

403
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:36,380
A-SINGLE-BITE IMMOBILIZATION MANEUVER

404
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:36,380
"A-Single-Bite Immobilization Maneuver"!

405
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:40,110
What?! Why did you do as you like,
without my permission!

406
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,900
Because I didn't need your permission.

407
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,200
Dojaku!

408
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,100
Okay!

409
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,490
What, what? Whaaat?!

410
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,940
--What's that?!
--Is it a cage?!

411
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:02,080
--Did he cage them along with their own crewmates?!
--Luffy!

412
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,820
What?! Was there such a rule?!

413
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:09,110
You fool, what are you doing?!

414
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,610
What will you do to my subordinates as well as the others?!

415
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:14,000
I have no interest in those two!
They were just in the way!

416
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,630
What?

417
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:18,360
My target is the Straw Hats!

418
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:23,570
My biggest goal is to capture all of them!

419
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,220
Luffy!

420
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:30,410
That jerk!
I thought there was something behind this!

421
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:36,270
Enough already! You lost the Davy Back
and became my subordinate so...

422
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,290
...you can't do as you like!

423
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,630
Be quiet!

424
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:44,950
There's no way I become
a subordinate of someone like you!

425
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:50,000
I lost to you so I could
accomplish my own plan!

426
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,090
In order to put the Straw Hats off their guard,
I wanted to draw them into the game!

427
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:55,960
What, what...

428
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:01,170
It was for my tactic but still it was so humiliating
to work under you!

429
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:02,740
--Your tactic?
--Yes!

430
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,550
STRAW HAT ERADICATION MANEUVER

431
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,960
"Straw Hat Eradication Maneuver"!

432
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,740
Split-Head! What is it all about?!

433
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,540
I-I don't quite know, either...

434
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,910
I'm done talking to you!

435
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:24,010
Oh, no!
He's gonna take them along with the cage!

436
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,630
Good job.

437
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:33,560
Whoa-whoa!
Where are you taking our captain and the others?

438
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,480
So solid!

439
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,320
You bastard! What have you done?!

440
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,340
I already told you. Weren't you listening...

441
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,860
I'm asking you what you made them eat!

442
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:51,560
It was the Drowsy Mushroom that grows naturally only on this island.

443
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:56,270
Those who eat it will lose
all of their fighting spirit, they say.

444
00:27:56,270 --> 00:28:00,380
That's why you quibbled about me.
To make us switch!

445
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,540
That's right!

446
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,340
I knew Pirate Hunter would be called in
to fill your shoes!

447
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,150
--Chopper! It's a Drowsy Mushroom!
--Okay!

448
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:11,260
--How is it?! Is it there?!
--It's no use!

449
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:15,730
It was discovered recently.
There's no way it's in the book!

450
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:20,790
So far, there is only one way to free someone
from the effects of a Drowsy Mushroom.

451
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:25,740
Eat a Rebound Mushroom
which also grows naturally on this island.

452
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,780
I see. So that's it.

453
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:29,090
What?

454
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,360
I'm back!

455
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,580
--Yeah!
--Well done, Robin!

456
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:41,930
Oh, damn you! Straw Hat is...

457
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:42,920
That's okay.

458
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,920
Let's pull the cage in.

459
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,470
Roger!

460
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,100
Oh, no! Luffy!

461
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,120
Okay!

462
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:06,240
What a fool! I can't even bend them...

463
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,680
Is it for real?!

464
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,660
Hey, Zoro! Sanji! Let's get out!

465
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,910
--Hey!
--Luffy, behind you!

466
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,420
Zoro! Sanji!

467
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:37,430
Now, my subordinates!
Show yourselves!

468
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,440
Ship-bottom squad here!
We're all ready!

469
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,900
Great. We'll withdraw!

470
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,350
No! The ship is leaving!

471
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:59,500
Bastard! You can't go anywhere!

472
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:05,130
Dammit!

473
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,550
Gum-Gum Rocket...

474
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,670
--Luffy!
--He's standing on the sand so...

475
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:16,090
Damn! Give back my friends!

476
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:19,130
Right. I knew that's what you'd do.

477
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:31,240
--Luffy!
--Oh, no! He fell into the sea!

478
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,720
It deflects pursuers with a slick coating.
It's called...

479
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,270
SLIPPING OIL SLICK MANEUVER

480
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,010
"Slipping Oil Slick Maneuver"!

481
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:39,270
You just put the oil there...

482
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,620
Dammit...

483
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:47,000
Komei!

484
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:51,300
Even if you can roar,
there's nothing you can do.

485
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:55,090
Straw Hats!

486
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:59,720
I'm sure it's frustrating and
you want to save your friends.

487
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:03,790
I won't run or hide! Come see me!

488
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:04,840
Here!

489
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,650
An Eternal Pose?

490
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,370
I'll be expecting you!

491
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:16,570
Don't underestimate me!
I have an ace in the hole!

492
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,700
Slow-Slow Beam!

493
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,870
That beam, huh?!

494
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,830
What the...!

495
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:37,200
I knew you'd do that.
And I had a countermeasure.

496
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,330
We thought this would happen
so I created something.

497
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:43,560
It's an interception for the Slow-Slow beam!

498
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:46,040
"Specular Reflection Maneuver"!

499
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:46,750
SPECULAR REFLECTION MANEUVER

500
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,610
Daaammmnnn...

501
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:57,050
Now, struggle with my maneuvers!

502
00:31:57,050 --> 00:32:02,850
Straw Hat Luffy!
Your friends' lives are in my hands!

503
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,700
Pirate Hunter and Black-Foot
can't even move now.

504
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,240
But the key one, Straw Hat is...

505
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,990
I saw it coming.

506
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:20,610
I knew they'd rip off the Rebound Mushroom
and cure Straw Hat first, as well.

507
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:22,580
Oh, you did?

508
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:27,750
We'll move on to the second plan from now.
Tell everyone!

509
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,730
Yes, sir!

510
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,390
We're back!

511
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:55,400
What's that Slow-Slow crap?

512
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,630
Foxy's a Devil Fruit eater, too.

513
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:00,760
He ate the Slow-Slow Fruit
and became a slow human.

514
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:04,640
When someone or something is
exposed to his Slow-Slow Beam,

515
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,500
it will become slow for 30 seconds.

516
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:12,130
It was longer than I expected. 30 seconds.

517
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:16,280
But the eater himself became slow-slow, too.
How hopeless he is.

518
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:20,820
Zoro... Sanji...

519
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:25,870
If they wanted to capture us, they could
but why did they leave?

520
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:30,330
The fact he told us about the Rebound Mushroom
is illogical, too.

521
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:33,090
You're right.

522
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:37,090
In addition, he invited us with this.

523
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:39,170
It's a trap, isn't it?

524
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:40,540
Probably.

525
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:45,260
That vice admiral seemed like quite a tactician.

526
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,840
Let's go!

527
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,190
That's right!
Even if it's a trap, we gotta do it!

528
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:01,700
Let's save Zoro-san and Sanji-san!

529
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,280
We must bring them to their senses!

530
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,780
We gotta find the Rebound Mushroom first!

531
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,810
I'll look for it!

532
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:11,130
Is this enough of a lead for you?

533
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:16,020
Do you still smell the Rebound Mushroom?

534
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,860
Uh-huh! I'll look for it following the scent!

535
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:22,470
I'll come with you.

536
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:29,060
If I separate my body and soul,
there is no limit to my field of search!

537
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:33,830
Straw Hat, you got an awesome guy
as your crew member!

538
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,730
Brook is living a super long life!

539
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:38,230
I don't think you call it a long life...

540
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:42,340
I'm sorry.

541
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:46,430
I'm the only one who got to eat
the Rebound Mushroom.

542
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,590
Right back at you.

543
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:53,580
Because I kind of set you guys up...
I'm sorry.

544
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:02,240
Luffy! You go ahead!
I'll catch up with you after I find it.

545
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,510
Got it!

546
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:05,660
Chopper, use it.

547
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,850
Thank you.

548
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:11,120
--Then, take these.
--Yeah.

549
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:14,040
I'll hand them over to him at any cost!

550
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,900
Both of you! I'm counting on you!

551
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,340
--Okay!
--Yes!

552
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,360
Straw Hat!

553
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:33,750
You're not the only one
who got your crew members taken!

554
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:38,060
They took our ship, too!

555
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,800
I know I have no right to ask
something like this.

556
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,090
But I wanna save my friends, too!

557
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:48,340
Boss...

558
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:51,310
Let me get on board.

559
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Please!

560
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,850
Boss...!

561
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,220
Come on board!

562
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,280
Split-Head!

563
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:16,710
You called me Split-Head again...

564
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,290
Boss!

565
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:23,110
Say something back! Say something back!

566
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:25,050
Don't let it bother you!

567
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:30,660
It's no time for feeling down, guys!

568
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,600
Yeah!

569
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,770
I'm in debt to you, Straw Hat!

570
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:37,350
Cut the crap and get on board already!

571
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,110
Boss!

572
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,770
Okay! Everyone, get on board!

573
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,900
Yeah!

574
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,050
No, we can't have all of them!

575
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:49,510
It's obvious that it'll be overloaded!

576
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:51,870
Think about the size of the ship!

577
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:54,220
Wait! Wait! Wait!

578
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:58,880
I appreciate your commitment!
But I'm responsible for this!

579
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,880
Will you leave it in my hands?

580
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:06,840
I will rescue Porche and Hamburg
no matter what!

581
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,880
Excuse me, Boss!

582
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:16,250
Kansho, what is it?

583
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:19,060
I really want you to take me with you!

584
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:23,860
I've just joined your crew
so I wanna do something for you!

585
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:26,820
Also...

586
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,400
Senpai!

587
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:31,780
Me? Senpai?

588
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:35,370
Your sniping skill was as amazing as they say.
I'm impressed!

589
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:37,850
That's really consummate skill!

590
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:40,000
Well, that's too much to say...!

591
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:44,040
The Navy is our enemy!
I know he'll use projectile weapons, too!

592
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,170
Gun for gun!

593
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:48,630
I'm sure I can help you!

594
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:51,090
Okay, you get on board, too!
Kancho (goosie) !

595
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,970
My name is KanSHO!

596
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:56,540
Okay!

597
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,810
Refueling completed!

598
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,770
We're ready, Luffy!

599
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:03,690
All right!

600
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:07,070
Sunny! Sail out!

601
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:25,400
We gotta go, too!

602
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,210
Yes, let's go!

603
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:29,530
Hey, you two!

604
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,740
We'll help you!

605
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:34,390
It's better to have more people
for the search!

606
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,100
Thank you!

607
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:47,360
The Davy Back Fight...
I wish I could play some new games...

608
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,590
I can't believe I'll fight together with you.

609
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:54,160
We have the same purpose so it's good.

610
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:04,010
Since I lost to you it has been terrible.

611
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:21,790
FOX

612
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:21,790
That Jolly Roger became a symbol of losing.

613
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,250
No matter how many Davy Back Fights I won,

614
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:28,750
as long as we have that Jolly Roger,

615
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:33,550
the label "the man who got defeated by Straw Hat"
has stuck with me.

616
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:38,570
But Komei didn't laugh at me.

617
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,750
As long as you're tied to your past,

618
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,960
it's the same as time standing still.

619
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,330
That was also a part of his plan, though.

620
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:03,370
Well, this doesn't sound like me, does it?!

621
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:04,740
Nope! It doesn't!

622
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:10,460
You always say things straight out,
every single time!

623
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:12,840
Because it really doesn't sound like you!

624
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,950
You didn't need to tell me again...

625
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,910
Zoro was my first crew member.

626
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:24,040
My first crew members were
Porche and Hamburg.

627
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,280
No matter how many crew members have come and gone through Davy Back Fights,

628
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,510
they've always been with me.

629
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:45,060
When I become the King of the Pirates,
none of them can be left behind.

630
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,650
It shouldn't be without them.

631
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,600
They're my friends!

632
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:02,740
As a token of our friendship, I'll give you this!

633
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,930
Thank you!

634
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,870
While I'm at it, here's a big treat!

635
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,860
All of you Straw Hats can have it!

636
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:14,920
Don't want it.

637
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:18,420
Why don't you guys put it on, too?

638
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:22,010
It's embarrassing as a human being!

639
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,470
I'll pass on it...

640
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:26,100
What?! But it's cool...

641
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,770
It's so hot!

642
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:34,270
The two opposing groups join hands
and challenge the formidable enemy!

643
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:35,840
Senpai, have one!

644
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,570
No, I really don't want it.

645
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:39,780
Eat it! In return for the pin-badge!

646
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,390
Straw Hat!

647
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:44,740
--Let's energize ourselves and create havoc!
--Yeah!

648
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:53,000
Wait for me! Fan guy!

649
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,700
Should we leave them like this?

650
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:09,740
I have no interest in the Foxy Pirates
but since they're pirates, we can't let them free.

651
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:12,810
We'll execute them along with the Straw Hats!

652
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:21,770
All serene. They're still quiet.

653
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:29,450
They're ill-famed tough guys but
how pathetic.

654
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:33,430
I'll throw the rest of your crew in here soon!

655
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,710
Wait for it!

656
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:41,920
This isn't it...

657
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,300
Not it, either!

658
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,010
How about this?

659
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:49,370
This isn't it, either!

660
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:53,110
Well, we have to
just keep looking for it patiently!

661
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:05,680
Boy! I thought my heart was gonna explode!

662
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,430
Although I don't have a heart.

663
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:21,460
--It's because of this mushroom.
--Let's call it a Sneeze Mushroom.

664
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:24,860
Hey! What the...
Did something happen to you?

665
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:27,280
No! Stay away!

666
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:32,560
--I said...
--"Stay away."

667
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:35,770
What a huge steel trap!

668
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,020
Don't tell me you guys set it up.

669
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:41,430
No way! Look!

670
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:43,660
At this!

671
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:44,840
APPROVED BY KOMEI

672
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:48,440
What an easy-to-understand person
Komei is...

673
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,330
Brook?

674
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,080
Shh! The atmosphere changed.

675
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:58,270
I can sense it with my bones literally.

676
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,750
We're under siege.

677
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:04,070
Duck!

678
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,500
Is that the island?

679
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,940
No mistake!
The needle is pointing towards it!

680
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:28,530
I see a pirate ship in the west.

681
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:30,850
It's the Straw Hats' Jolly Roger!

682
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:32,240
Here they come.

683
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,040
Be ready to ambush!

684
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,890
Arrange in the crane-wing formation
and surround them!

685
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:37,980
Yes, sir!

686
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:43,550
They were lying in wait as I thought!

687
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:46,990
They'll attack us from both sides.
This is not good.

688
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:50,450
If they're not in front of us,
we can't even use the Gaon Cannon!

689
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:55,850
I did research.
I also know that they don't have enough gunners.

690
00:44:57,870 --> 00:44:59,670
Oh, no! They started shooting already!

691
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:01,090
What about the Coup de Burst?

692
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:03,570
No! It's too late!

693
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,450
Leave it to me!

694
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,360
Slow-Slow...

695
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:11,220
...Beam!

696
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,000
And...

697
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:18,830
Slower! Slower!

698
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:19,920
Slower!

699
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:21,520
Slower! Slower! Slower!

700
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,060
Slower! Slower! Slower!

701
00:45:28,070 --> 00:45:29,950
Wow! They stopped!

702
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:31,950
What?! It's awesome!

703
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:36,930
It's not completely stopped
but when I use Slower-Slower, this is what happens.

704
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:38,210
Cool!

705
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:41,350
--How long will it last?
--30 seconds, of course.

706
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:42,940
30 seconds, again?!

707
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,130
That's not so great.

708
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:48,300
Shut up! You don't know how tough it was
to master it!

709
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:52,430
There was a tearjerking story!
You wanna hear it?

710
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:53,950
--Not at all.
--Too quick!

711
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:55,830
Almost 30 seconds already.

712
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:58,160
Oh yeah! Franky!

713
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:03,440
It's ready thanks to that!
Hold on really tight!

714
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,230
Coup de Burst!

715
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:24,400
Oh! The Navy ships are...

716
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:28,210
--Boss, you did it!
--Six ships got wrecked!

717
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:32,180
See that?!
That's the power of the Slower-Slower!

718
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:34,160
I like it! Slower-Slower!

719
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:36,510
It's useful depending on how you use it.

720
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:39,210
Well, it's a pain if the user is our enemy.

721
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:45,250
A-All ships have been wrecked!
The Straw Hats broke through the ambush fleet!

722
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:48,950
Confirming seven from the pirate ship landed on the island!

723
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:51,090
They're climbing the outer rim of the crater!

724
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:56,510
I got a report that two Devil Fruit eaters
have remained on the Mushroom Island.

725
00:46:57,910 --> 00:46:59,370
That's good.

726
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:03,310
That's the point of giving them information
about the Rebound Mushroom.

727
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,510
Hey, Split-Head, you're behind.

728
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:11,880
Shut up!

729
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,760
Boss, you can do it!

730
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,870
I can go Slow-Slow but I don't like to hustle!

731
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:21,960
What's with this island?

732
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:33,820
What do you call it? A caldera?

733
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,510
There is something that looks like a volcanic vent in the basin.

734
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:42,460
But that looks like water vapor
instead of volcanic smoke.

735
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:47,150
But it's definitely a Navy base.

736
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:50,790
I see building-like things everywhere
on the rock towers.

737
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:55,360
They seem to say,
"We're not gonna let you get away no matter what!"

738
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:57,740
There are more warships.

739
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:02,600
I see some human figures on the outer rim.

740
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:07,560
One, two... There are seven.
I assume they're the Straw Hats.

741
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,420
Report to the vice admiral!

742
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:12,760
Okay. Put the second plan in motion.

743
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:16,260
Welcome, people of the Straw Hats!

744
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:18,170
I'm a special operation adviser

745
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:23,290
from the Strategies/Tactics
Research and Development Division of the Navy -

746
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:25,670
Vice Admiral Komei!

747
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:26,810
Too long...

748
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,920
Where are you, Fan guy?!

749
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:33,230
Do you think I'll tell you guys that honestly?

750
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:37,800
Well, I'll just say somewhere on
one of those rock towers.

751
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,180
Your friends are there, too.

752
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:44,230
He's using echoes quite effectively.
I can't tell where he's speaking from.

753
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:48,290
One of those rock towers?
There are tons of those!

754
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,980
Do you think it's true?

755
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:54,320
It's fifty-fifty.
I can't deny the chance that he's telling the truth.

756
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:58,870
Don't make it so frustrating!
I thought your target was me!

757
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:01,390
It's all of you.

758
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:04,500
I suggest you to try your best and find them.

759
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:09,830
Hmmm, let me think.
I'll give you plenty of time.

760
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:12,840
How about until the break of day tomorrow?

761
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:18,200
If you can rescue them before
the sun rises above the horizon, you win.

762
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:24,770
If you fail, you guys will
fall into my clutches on this island.

763
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:32,230
All of us are his target, he said.

764
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:36,590
It was an apparent provocation.
There are obviously some traps.

765
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:38,450
I guess.

766
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:40,910
Oh, my chronic disease of... um...

767
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:42,330
Enough with that!

768
00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:43,450
Okay.

769
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:45,830
But we're going, aren't we?

770
00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:47,520
Yes, we are!

771
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:49,120
I thought so.

772
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:52,320
It can't be helped that
the Navy will come after us.

773
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:56,170
But whatever your target is,

774
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:02,160
I'll find and save my friends at any cost!

775
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,240
Great.

776
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:08,590
He's so cool!

777
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:10,790
That's what I expect from the man that I think highly of.

778
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,380
"Try to find them"?
I don't wanna take it slow like that!

779
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:19,010
I'll destroy them all at once!

780
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:21,910
What?! But your friends are in one of the towers!

781
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:26,370
We can't stop him now.
Well, I'm sure they'll be fine.

782
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:28,020
Is it like that?

783
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:31,120
Ho-hum. We have no choice but to go along as I thought.

784
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,040
Yeah.

785
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:37,190
Gum-Gum...

786
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:44,410
...Hawk Gatling!

787
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:03,070
--What? What's the matter?
--My strength...

788
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:05,140
What?! What?!
What did they do to you?!

789
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:07,010
It feels like...

790
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:14,330
--Hey!
--You, too?! What happened?!

791
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:18,960
I don't know!
I felt something grabbed me and...

792
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,040
...now I'm losing my strength!

793
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,570
--Is it Sea Prism Stone?
--A bit different!

794
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,470
It's coiling around my hands...

795
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:31,950
Or like some plant creeping around
my hands...

796
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:34,350
--What's that?!
--Oh my!

797
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:36,870
Are you getting pulled
by your own stretching force?!

798
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:40,670
Really?! What is that plant?!

799
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:42,860
What do you think has happened?!

800
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:46,340
I don't know. Straw Hat and the other one lost it all of a sudden.

801
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:49,760
Watch out!

802
00:51:57,170 --> 00:51:58,730
Star Shield!

803
00:51:58,730 --> 00:51:59,710
That?!

804
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:14,940
Perfect!

805
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:16,520
Far from it!

806
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:20,000
Oh? Where's Robin?

807
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,070
That plant again...

808
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:33,690
Robin?! Hey, Robin?!
Where are you?! Answer me!

809
00:52:36,330 --> 00:52:37,690
Are you there?

810
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:41,670
What the hell is wrong with this plant?
It's coiling around my hands!

811
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:42,980
Boss!

812
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,880
Where's Robin?!

813
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:49,200
--I don't know! I really don't know!
--Boss!

814
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:55,210
What is this plant?!
It doesn't look like it's moving or anything...

815
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:00,060
Strong smell of the sea!
Don't tell me it's...

816
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:02,030
You have quite quick wits.

817
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:07,950
That plant is indigenous to the island
which obtains seawater to grow.

818
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:12,490
For some reason, it reacts to Devil Fruit eaters
and coils around them.

819
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:16,050
The mechanism of it is unexplained but it's proven

820
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:20,210
that it has the same effect as Sea Prism Stone.

821
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:26,050
It's a very useful plant
for a normal person like me.

822
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:31,680
Seems like you're looking for Nico Robin
but I've just been told that we caught her.

823
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:32,620
What?!

824
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:34,660
You Devil Fruit eaters,

825
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:39,000
especially the ones that are
running wild as pirates, tend to be overconfident...

826
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,730
...about your own power.
You don't pay much attention to things around you.

827
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:47,050
It's a great strategy that seizes upon that weak point.

828
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:48,220
It's called...

829
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:52,830
ANATHEMATIC SEA WHOLESALE ASSAULT MANEUVER

830
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:52,110
"Anathematic Sea Wholesale Assault Maneuver"!

831
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:59,670
There are more and more eye-popping secrets
to this island!

832
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:03,580
They're so amazing and
Devil Fruit eaters have no chance against them!

833
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:07,980
The Worst Generation?

834
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:09,940
The people who are depending on their

835
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:12,830
ability become just helpless against a calculated plan!

836
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:16,890
I'll catch all of you way before the dawn!

837
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:21,690
On the island that the god of the sea has given to us,
which kills the Devil Fruit eaters!

838
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:27,630
The island of fog - Nebulandia!

839
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,550
Hey, Straw Hat...

840
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,460
Oh, my Fear-of-unknown-islands-osis
is acting up!

841
00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:37,180
Senpai?

842
00:54:38,830 --> 00:54:40,310
The island of fog?

843
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:46,380
I can't believe it...
I found myself getting emotional talking to them.

844
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:47,550
It's not like me.

845
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:53,510
No wonder.
We finally get to execute your plan.

846
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:54,990
Yes, that's right.

847
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:59,040
There were no other islands like this
which is exactly what I've been looking for.

848
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:01,890
I've always been thinking.

849
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:04,510
How can we non Devil Fruit eaters

850
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:08,320
capture the Devil Fruit eating pirates who act as they please?

851
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:13,090
Having plans wasn't enough.
We needed a geographical advantage, too.

852
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:15,320
Yes!

853
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:18,660
The island itself exercises
"Ability Nullification Maneuver"!

854
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:20,790
ABILITY NULLIFICATION MANEUVER

855
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:24,130
I chose this place as the field of the decisive battle against them.

856
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:30,340
And they have been lured exactly as I designed.

857
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:32,630
Why the sea?

858
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:38,060
We Devil Fruit eaters have Devil Fruit powers
after eating Devil Fruits but in return,

859
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:41,120
we risk being hated by sea.

860
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:42,370
Being hated?

861
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:46,670
They say Devil Fruits are the incarnations of
the Sea Devil so...

862
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:50,400
...they can't move even a bit
under the influence of seawater.

863
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:55,260
That's why once they sink into it,
they'll never be able to come up.

864
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:58,120
The whole island is like Sea Prism Stone.

865
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,830
Sea Prism Stone?

866
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:02,960
It is said to be a stone
formed by the substance of seawater.

867
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,210
What?! Then...

868
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:07,630
For example, the handcuffs that
the Navy has are made of it.

869
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:12,090
Since they have the same effect as seawater,
they nullify Devil Fruit eaters' powers.

870
00:56:12,090 --> 00:56:15,740
What?! That means
this island is very dangerous!

871
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:19,230
He didn't kill Luffy in the Davy Back Fight because

872
00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:22,180
he wanted to take down all of us without fail.

873
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:27,830
Locking up Zoro and Sanji, and disempowering
the Devil Fruit eaters gave him the advantage.

874
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:29,790
Really, Navy?!

875
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,960
So what?

876
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:34,500
Fan guy!

877
00:56:35,110 --> 00:56:39,340
I won't leave this island
until I take back everybody!

878
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,780
--Dammit!
--Luffy!

879
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,650
--Stop!
--You stay still!

880
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:08,870
That bastard!

881
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:14,820
The more you move, the more you get hurt...
This is the worst island ever!

882
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:15,840
Damn!

883
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:21,240
Senpai! This is exactly when
sniping is needed!

884
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:22,010
Okay!

885
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:28,270
I'm gonna super show it off!

886
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:31,560
Hey! Are you ready?!

887
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:32,400
--Yes!
--Yeah!

888
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,280
Go!

889
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:36,190
Coup de Vent!

890
00:57:48,850 --> 00:57:49,670
Hey!

891
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:52,670
Damn!
There are more and more of them!

892
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:55,340
How about this?! Climate Baton!

893
00:57:57,860 --> 00:57:59,460
Black Ball!

894
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:15,020
--A lightning conductor?!
--They're not gonna let it hit the tower, huh?!

895
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:22,050
Judging from the situation here,
Chopper and Brook are probably...

896
00:58:22,050 --> 00:58:23,680
I guess.

897
00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:30,520
They got caught covering for us...

898
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:39,570
Chuchun!
Take these two and get away!

899
00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:40,300
What?!

900
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:45,540
Leave them to us and find the Rebound Mushroom whatever it takes!

901
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:47,040
Count on us!

902
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:54,090
I gotta go back to save them!

903
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,030
Look at that.

904
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:02,490
Sea Prism Stone handcuffs?

905
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:07,060
When we get tied with those,
we can't use our abilities.

906
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:11,230
That's why we have to prioritize
the Rebound Mushroom for now!

907
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:12,210
Uh-huh!

908
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:23,000
Wait for us! We'll definitely be back
to save you later!

909
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:44,070
Vice Admiral Komei. You've got a call
from Vice Admiral Tsuru from HQ.

910
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:47,140
Why it's Great Advisor-dono.

911
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,620
How is everything going?

912
00:59:49,970 --> 00:59:54,120
I know you.
You must be having a great time, I guess.

913
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:54,100
CLEAN JUSTICE

914
00:59:54,370 --> 00:59:56,360
Having a great time...

915
00:59:56,360 --> 01:00:01,010
The operation is going well
as I initially planned.

916
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:06,050
It should be.
Since I left so many troops in your hands.

917
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:10,330
The sun will set soon.
The decisive moment will be after the sunset.

918
01:00:10,330 --> 01:00:14,980
I'll bring nine heads of the Straw Hats
to you at any cost.

919
01:00:15,330 --> 01:00:16,460
Clank.

920
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:20,340
We have to respond to
Great Advisor's expectations.

921
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:22,110
Don't be a fool.

922
01:00:22,630 --> 01:00:27,620
Expectations or praise...
I have no interest in those flimsy things.

923
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:34,140
Let's hunt down the remaining six.
Without a single mistake.

924
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:49,950
I see...

925
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:52,790
You jerk!

926
01:00:55,830 --> 01:00:59,730
We can go down underground
from where we blasted through.

927
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:03,030
Underground? Can we get to the place
where Zoro and Sanji are like that?

928
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:07,480
I don't know about that.
There are a whole bunch of machines down there.

929
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:13,660
Just saying maybe we can destroy
the system of those towers using that machinery.

930
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,160
Alright! I'm going!

931
01:01:15,350 --> 01:01:17,810
It's filled with seawater.

932
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:22,710
Seems like seawater is flowing into
the ground of this island.

933
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:27,150
Oh, crap! This island is really unfavorable
for Devil Fruit eaters.

934
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:29,870
We have no choice!
The two of us should do it!

935
01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:31,080
Count me in!

936
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:33,950
Why don't you stay with your boss?

937
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:35,770
What?! Just the two of you going?!

938
01:01:36,330 --> 01:01:38,980
Somebody capable must remain.
Otherwise, there'll be too much trouble.

939
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:41,480
I got it!

940
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:44,780
--Sorry. Could you hold these?
--Okay.

941
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:48,660
So heavy!

942
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:52,240
Wait for us, Luffy!
We'll find out where they are as well.

943
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:53,610
Yeah.

944
01:01:53,970 --> 01:01:55,140
All right!

945
01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:11,450
Hm? Is it fog?

946
01:02:11,450 --> 01:02:14,060
That's because the temperature has dropped
after the sunset.

947
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:19,440
That's more like a geyser than a volcano.
That's why it's humid here.

948
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:29,680
Chunchun-san...
I mean, Chuchun-san! Wake up!

949
01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:47,900
What's that? The mountain is wriggling!

950
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:49,950
Chuchun, descend!

951
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:55,990
It'll eat us and we'll be reduced to bones!

952
01:02:55,990 --> 01:02:58,250
But I'm already just bones...

953
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:05,840
The moving mountain was actually...

954
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:07,190
...Him.

955
01:03:07,710 --> 01:03:11,510
Brook, music!
Make him relax so we can help him!

956
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:16,720
But, if I play,
it's like telling the Navy that we're here!

957
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:18,470
I can't leave him like that!

958
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:23,020
I understand.

959
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:27,330
Okay then, listen to this.
A healing melody.

960
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,740
Heavy Point!

961
01:03:40,330 --> 01:03:45,130
Don't worry! I'll save you at any cost!

962
01:03:56,010 --> 01:03:59,800
You can relax.
Chopper-san is a good doctor.

963
01:04:00,730 --> 01:04:03,810
It's gonna hurt a little but be patient!

964
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,070
What's the matter?

965
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:10,590
This smell!

966
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:17,240
The Rebound Mushroom?!

967
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:20,700
There they are!
The color and the shape match the image!

968
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:23,900
Please be careful!

969
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:28,060
I have a good idea!
I name him Mushroomconda!

970
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:31,090
Mushroomconda...

971
01:04:31,090 --> 01:04:34,840
It has both the strangeness of mushrooms
and the dangerousness of giant creatures.

972
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:36,070
It's a good name.

973
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:42,950
Oh, no!

974
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:48,960
I thought so!
My music has brought the Navy here!

975
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:04,040
Isn't it getting sort of sticky?

976
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:08,480
Am I imagining it?
The smell of the sea is getting stronger.

977
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:09,870
The smell of the sea?

978
01:05:11,090 --> 01:05:16,030
I see! This fog formed because
the seawater underground got heated up!

979
01:05:16,050 --> 01:05:18,050
Seawater fog?

980
01:05:18,050 --> 01:05:22,220
Whatever it is, it's favorable for us.
We can hide ourselves.

981
01:05:22,220 --> 01:05:23,310
Yeah.

982
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:28,980
What? But then,
is it the same as soaking in the sea?

983
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:30,690
Luffy, are you okay?

984
01:05:30,690 --> 01:05:31,980
Oh, no...

985
01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:35,210
I'm totally losing my strength...

986
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:37,950
Boss! Stay with me!

987
01:05:37,950 --> 01:05:41,970
How pathetic...
If I get attacked now, I'm finished.

988
01:05:41,970 --> 01:05:43,870
Don't say that.

989
01:05:43,870 --> 01:05:45,840
Straw Hat Luffy.

990
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:48,480
How do you feel?

991
01:05:48,790 --> 01:05:54,960
I think you're suffering
like you're in the sea now.

992
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:58,570
This is my second plan!
"Nighttime Fog Maneuver"!

993
01:05:58,590 --> 01:06:00,340
NIGHTTIME FOG MANEUVER

994
01:06:00,430 --> 01:06:02,600
Cut the maneuver crap!

995
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:10,700
Nipple Light!

996
01:06:12,190 --> 01:06:14,730
That's gross! I don't like it!

997
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:24,540
There is a reaction underground.
There are two people.

998
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:26,500
Mm-hm. I knew they'd do that.

999
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:28,080
Where are they now?

1000
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:30,210
They're close to this operation room.

1001
01:06:30,210 --> 01:06:31,920
--Clank.
--Vice Admiral.

1002
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:35,590
I just got a call from the detachment force
on the Mushroom Island.

1003
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:39,380
He said they took custody of the ship doctor
and the musician from the Straw Hats,

1004
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:43,140
and many from the Foxy Pirates
successfully.

1005
01:06:45,310 --> 01:06:49,040
It's all going as planned!
Announce to all soldiers!

1006
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:54,020
We're moving on to the third plan!
We're entering the final phase at last!

1007
01:06:54,020 --> 01:06:56,150
--Yes, sir!
--Okay!

1008
01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:05,080
Oh, crap!

1009
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:17,280
Franky!

1010
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,820
What's that?!
Why is it glowing there?

1011
01:07:27,390 --> 01:07:31,290
You've gotta to be kidding!
Hey! Franky!

1012
01:07:38,070 --> 01:07:39,880
Komei, you bastard!

1013
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:44,340
Even a cyborg can't get away from it.

1014
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:46,950
Now,

1015
01:07:47,950 --> 01:07:51,790
you can't keep hanging there forever!

1016
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:54,350
Straw Hat Luffy!

1017
01:07:55,630 --> 01:07:59,440
We got Cyborg Franky and Sniper King!

1018
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:04,450
Furthermore, we already placed the reindeer
and the skeleton under restraint, too!

1019
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:07,260
Chopper and... Brook?

1020
01:08:09,270 --> 01:08:12,310
You literally can't do anything, can you?

1021
01:08:12,310 --> 01:08:17,250
Cat Burglar there is
the only friend you have left.

1022
01:08:17,270 --> 01:08:22,820
Looks like you guys and I have
a big difference in power.

1023
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:27,260
Thus, I'll change the rules a little bit.

1024
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:31,040
Change them?
I don't like the way you talk down to us!

1025
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:39,130
It's still before sunrise
but I'll take all of your captured friends outside.

1026
01:08:39,130 --> 01:08:42,900
In exchange for that,
I want you to come get them on your own!

1027
01:08:43,130 --> 01:08:45,930
What?! Are you playing a game or something?!

1028
01:08:45,930 --> 01:08:50,170
Are you in or not?! Just state it clearly!

1029
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:53,120
Hey! What about Porche and Hamburg?!

1030
01:08:53,230 --> 01:08:56,980
If you can make it
before the sun rises above the horizon,

1031
01:08:56,980 --> 01:09:00,610
you can trade yourself for your friends.

1032
01:09:00,610 --> 01:09:02,680
I said "What about my friends?!"

1033
01:09:03,130 --> 01:09:08,580
If you can't make it, your friends will be sent to Impel Down as arranged!

1034
01:09:09,830 --> 01:09:11,400
Are you in?

1035
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:13,020
Luffy...

1036
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:17,270
I'm not gonna let you have my friends!

1037
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:18,350
Luffy...

1038
01:09:22,590 --> 01:09:26,200
Good. Then, let's begin!

1039
01:09:26,590 --> 01:09:28,060
He ignored me...

1040
01:09:31,930 --> 01:09:33,020
Hey!

1041
01:09:35,230 --> 01:09:39,080
Split-Head!
I'll bring your friends back, too!

1042
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:42,360
Luffy!

1043
01:09:44,110 --> 01:09:46,340
I'm okay! I'll go by myself!

1044
01:09:49,870 --> 01:09:51,160
Luffy!

1045
01:09:57,790 --> 01:09:59,520
Straw Hat...

1046
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:19,400
I can't believe this. The formidable Straw Hats
have been brought down this easily...

1047
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:22,890
Boss! We can't let Straw Hat go alone!

1048
01:10:23,770 --> 01:10:24,980
Hey!

1049
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:28,610
I don't think that dirty Komei
will fight him so straightforwardly!

1050
01:10:28,610 --> 01:10:29,840
Wait a sec!

1051
01:10:29,990 --> 01:10:34,060
It's our turn to help Straw Hat
who brought us here!

1052
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:35,560
You...

1053
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:38,430
--Kancho is right!
--It's KanSHO!

1054
01:10:38,430 --> 01:10:41,170
Split-Head!
Try your best and pay back your debt!

1055
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:42,560
Still calling me that?!

1056
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:18,350
Zoro!

1057
01:11:18,620 --> 01:11:19,480
Sanji!

1058
01:11:19,910 --> 01:11:20,890
Robin!

1059
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:22,270
Franky!

1060
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:23,780
Usopp!

1061
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:24,860
Luffy!

1062
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:26,050
Everybody!

1063
01:11:26,050 --> 01:11:27,860
L-Luffy! It's a trap!

1064
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:30,150
Don't come closer...

1065
01:11:30,170 --> 01:11:32,430
I'll save you now!

1066
01:11:32,430 --> 01:11:36,910
Are you on your own?
Where's Nami?! And the others?!

1067
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:38,770
No...

1068
01:11:38,770 --> 01:11:40,040
S-Stay away...

1069
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:42,190
I'm sure it's a trap!

1070
01:11:42,190 --> 01:11:43,290
I know...

1071
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:47,860
Luffy!

1072
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:52,780
L-Luffy!

1073
01:11:55,370 --> 01:11:58,620
Sorry that I'm late.

1074
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:04,420
Let's get off of this annoying island already
and go on an adventure again, all nine of us!

1075
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:06,500
Hang on!

1076
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:10,280
I'll save you right now!!

1077
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:13,510
--What an idiot...
--Luffy...

1078
01:12:14,890 --> 01:12:17,740
Yeah, that's right! Just save us already!

1079
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:22,910
Luffy!

1080
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:26,130
That was close...

1081
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,610
Luffy! Don't fall!

1082
01:12:30,610 --> 01:12:32,030
Yeah!

1083
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:38,870
Hey! Luffy!

1084
01:12:38,870 --> 01:12:42,850
I feel weaker than before...

1085
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:49,110
He's...

1086
01:12:49,590 --> 01:12:53,130
A hidden pitfall is my most favorite trap.

1087
01:12:54,050 --> 01:12:58,680
Although it's the simplest trap
that mankind has ever invented,

1088
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:01,040
it's very effective.

1089
01:13:02,810 --> 01:13:04,040
It's called...

1090
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:08,230
CREWMATE PITFALL MANEUVER

1091
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:08,250
..."Crewmate Pitfall Maneuver"!

1092
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:13,550
The fact you think a great deal of your friends
will bring about your own death!

1093
01:13:13,570 --> 01:13:15,660
There is seawater down there.

1094
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:17,490
Oh, that's why...

1095
01:13:17,490 --> 01:13:21,640
It's quite simple but there is
a thick darkness of fear.

1096
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:23,980
You jerk...

1097
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:27,750
Are you terrified?

1098
01:13:28,420 --> 01:13:32,860
When I was a child,
I experienced bigger terror.

1099
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:37,990
The ones that made me terrified were
none other than pirates!

1100
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:41,620
They rampaged through my home town.

1101
01:13:41,620 --> 01:13:44,420
It was such a hideous tragedy that I could hardly bear to look at!

1102
01:13:45,230 --> 01:13:47,520
Pirates are evil!

1103
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,270
You see?!

1104
01:13:49,270 --> 01:13:54,360
I joined the Navy to fight against evil
and eradicate it! But...

1105
01:13:55,650 --> 01:13:58,030
...I couldn't believe it!

1106
01:13:58,030 --> 01:14:03,900
Both the World Government and the Navy
tolerate pirates for the maintenance of order!

1107
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:10,330
People at higher levels can't see how ordinary people are
living under threat of...

1108
01:14:10,330 --> 01:14:12,500
...the violence of pirates!

1109
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:15,940
The era of violence will never end like this!

1110
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:20,640
Because they're trying to counter
violence with violence!

1111
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:25,340
Does it mean powerless people
can't do anything?!

1112
01:14:25,850 --> 01:14:31,150
Nay! There is a weapon to fight back!
A weapon called wisdom!

1113
01:14:31,150 --> 01:14:35,530
With my wisdom, I'll bring an end to
this era of the cycle of violence!

1114
01:14:35,530 --> 01:14:39,970
That will give hope to powerless people!

1115
01:14:40,450 --> 01:14:44,540
To accomplish that,
I'll even reform the Navy!

1116
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:48,730
You people are sacrifices
for the ray of hope!

1117
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:52,380
Luffy!

1118
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:56,080
You knew something like this would happen to you!

1119
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:58,860
Then, why would you wanna become a pirate?

1120
01:14:59,180 --> 01:15:02,320
I don't understand
what you people are thinking.

1121
01:15:03,470 --> 01:15:05,580
It's your loss!

1122
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:09,450
That you don't know the adventures
we're having!

1123
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:14,190
So what?

1124
01:15:14,190 --> 01:15:18,440
Pirates can seek adventures freely!

1125
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:20,910
Across the vast extent of the sea!

1126
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:24,780
I understand.

1127
01:15:24,780 --> 01:15:28,810
The fact that
it's impossible to understand you.

1128
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:32,900
Luffy!

1129
01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:44,530
The way you hang onto your life!

1130
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:47,290
I admire that.

1131
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:50,810
Oh... Oh, no!

1132
01:15:50,810 --> 01:15:51,710
That's...

1133
01:15:51,730 --> 01:15:53,070
Haki?!

1134
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:02,880
H-He's dancing!

1135
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:06,280
The Haki of the Color of Arms!

1136
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:08,190
With that spirit of mine,

1137
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:12,850
I apply power to my fan!

1138
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:28,760
Is that for real?!

1139
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:30,430
Now,

1140
01:16:31,850 --> 01:16:36,460
out of respect for your tenacity,
I'll finish you off myself.

1141
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:38,880
Push you with this sword and...

1142
01:16:39,860 --> 01:16:45,890
...I will watch you sink down to your end
with my own two eyes!

1143
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:48,510
Don't do it!!

1144
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:52,020
Luffy!!

1145
01:17:04,930 --> 01:17:06,360
Heat Egg!

1146
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:10,410
--Oh, Nami-san!
--Ow, ow, ow, ow...

1147
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:11,790
The fog is clearing!

1148
01:17:13,770 --> 01:17:15,080
Everybody! Oh!

1149
01:17:15,190 --> 01:17:17,020
--You came!
--Nami!

1150
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:18,080
Where's Luffy?!

1151
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:20,530
In the seawater
in the pitfall right there!

1152
01:17:20,530 --> 01:17:21,440
What?!

1153
01:17:21,650 --> 01:17:22,550
Look up!

1154
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:30,220
Luffy!!

1155
01:17:31,660 --> 01:17:33,930
I'm counting on you, Nami! Save Luffy...

1156
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:37,310
Nami!

1157
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:39,150
Nami!

1158
01:17:40,630 --> 01:17:41,710
Hey.

1159
01:17:41,710 --> 01:17:44,470
If you move even a bit,
I'll blow your head off.

1160
01:17:44,470 --> 01:17:46,900
--Good job, you!
--Yeah!

1161
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:49,680
Be careful! He uses Haki!

1162
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:52,370
When the fog is clear,
we have the upper hand.

1163
01:17:53,310 --> 01:17:58,480
Get away from the hole. Slowly.
Don't do anything foolish.

1164
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:00,400
Yeah, good boy!

1165
01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:07,110
Where are my friends?!

1166
01:18:07,110 --> 01:18:09,190
Look for them yourself.

1167
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:11,970
--Kansho, hold this.
--Okay!

1168
01:18:13,330 --> 01:18:16,520
--Hey! Help Nami!
--Okay!

1169
01:18:20,670 --> 01:18:22,710
Hold onto it tight!

1170
01:18:22,710 --> 01:18:24,170
Pull me up!

1171
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:30,600
--Nami!
--Ow, ow!

1172
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:31,950
Is Luffy okay?!

1173
01:18:32,050 --> 01:18:33,280
He isn't breathing!

1174
01:18:33,390 --> 01:18:35,040
--What?!
--Luffy!

1175
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:36,660
Oh, damn!

1176
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:39,730
Hey! Wake up!

1177
01:18:40,770 --> 01:18:43,130
Hey! Hey!

1178
01:18:46,110 --> 01:18:47,610
Wake up!

1179
01:18:47,780 --> 01:18:49,250
Straw Hat!

1180
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:51,560
Luffy!

1181
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:54,620
Wake up!!

1182
01:18:54,620 --> 01:18:56,000
Luffy...

1183
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,450
Wake up! Wake up!

1184
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:04,090
Hey! Just wake up already,
Straw Hat!

1185
01:19:04,090 --> 01:19:07,530
You said you're gonna become
the King of the Pirates!

1186
01:19:07,550 --> 01:19:09,050
Luffy...

1187
01:19:09,050 --> 01:19:10,030
Ouch!

1188
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:16,520
--Luffy!
--Oh, good...

1189
01:19:17,770 --> 01:19:20,870
--You scared me!
--Yeah...

1190
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:23,400
Everybody!

1191
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:25,960
--Let's get off of this island!
--Uh-huh!

1192
01:19:26,690 --> 01:19:27,760
Yeah!

1193
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:30,400
Together with Split-Head's friends!

1194
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:31,430
Straw Hat!

1195
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:48,870
Hey...

1196
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:56,200
No... Luffy...

1197
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:59,380
Luffy!!

1198
01:20:00,770 --> 01:20:02,170
H-He is...

1199
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:06,860
Kansho!

1200
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:10,880
Did you... Did you shoot him?!

1201
01:20:12,740 --> 01:20:13,660
It's called...

1202
01:20:13,660 --> 01:20:17,620
TWO-SIDED BACKSTAB MANEUVER

1203
01:20:14,950 --> 01:20:17,100
..."Two-sided Backstab Maneuver"!

1204
01:20:17,660 --> 01:20:21,980
When someone turns his back on his ally,
it's the best chance to attack!

1205
01:20:22,330 --> 01:20:26,110
He lowered his guard for a while
when he got out of the pitfall safely.

1206
01:20:26,130 --> 01:20:30,490
That moment was what I was looking for
to take a sure shot!

1207
01:20:30,490 --> 01:20:32,700
Boss. Senpai.

1208
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:36,240
I'm sorry! But this is my job!

1209
01:20:36,930 --> 01:20:37,810
JUSTICE

1210
01:20:47,730 --> 01:20:49,420
You bastard!

1211
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:54,720
Wake up, Luffy!
Bullets don't harm you! Right?! Hey!

1212
01:20:54,820 --> 01:20:56,700
Wake up, Luffy!

1213
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:58,690
It's unforgivable...

1214
01:20:58,830 --> 01:21:00,430
Screw you!

1215
01:21:00,580 --> 01:21:02,770
Thunder Lance Tempo!

1216
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:13,190
--Arrest them!
--Yes, sir!

1217
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:25,600
Whoa-whoa-whoa!

1218
01:21:30,940 --> 01:21:32,610
--Nami!
--Don't move!

1219
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:35,680
I-I'm losing my strength...

1220
01:21:38,030 --> 01:21:39,720
I won!

1221
01:21:40,030 --> 01:21:45,090
Look! The man with a 400 million berry bounty
who heads the list of the Worst Generation,

1222
01:21:45,090 --> 01:21:48,940
Straw Hat and all of his crew are
in our custody!

1223
01:21:48,940 --> 01:21:52,980
It's our complete victory!

1224
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:06,310
You did it, Komei-kakka.

1225
01:22:06,310 --> 01:22:08,400
The capture of the Straw Hats!

1226
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:12,480
This is no less the beginning of
the end of the Pirate Era!

1227
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:14,280
That's right!

1228
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:19,490
The formidable Komei-kakka!
His name resounds all over the great sea!

1229
01:22:19,490 --> 01:22:24,930
The formidable Komei-kakka!
His name resounds all over the great sea!

1230
01:22:24,950 --> 01:22:29,460
The formidable Komei-kakka!
His name resounds all over the great sea!

1231
01:22:29,710 --> 01:22:32,260
I will have your skills!

1232
01:22:32,260 --> 01:22:33,610
--Dojaku!
--Yes, sir!

1233
01:22:33,910 --> 01:22:37,010
We'll take all seven of them
to the Navy Headquarters!

1234
01:22:37,010 --> 01:22:39,200
--Make preparations now!
--Got it!

1235
01:22:40,050 --> 01:22:41,620
Activate!

1236
01:22:56,360 --> 01:23:00,400
Look at that, you damn pirates!
I, Dojaku the genius, made...

1237
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:03,490
...the greatest gimmick of my life!

1238
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:21,360
A mushroom?! A snake?!

1239
01:23:24,660 --> 01:23:27,040
--Luffy!
--Boss!

1240
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:28,660
You guys...

1241
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:32,630
--I thought we captured them!
--Oh, great!

1242
01:23:33,810 --> 01:23:35,000
I'm here!

1243
01:23:35,270 --> 01:23:36,590
You're okay!

1244
01:23:36,690 --> 01:23:37,810
How annoying!

1245
01:23:47,370 --> 01:23:48,980
Awesome!

1246
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:52,290
--Everybody, help me!
--Yeah!

1247
01:23:54,460 --> 01:23:56,230
Kung Fu Point!

1248
01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:02,550
Brook!

1249
01:24:02,550 --> 01:24:04,340
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1250
01:24:30,370 --> 01:24:32,690
All of you, charge!

1251
01:24:45,010 --> 01:24:47,780
Take this!
The powder of the Sneeze Mushroom!

1252
01:24:49,020 --> 01:24:50,410
Yeah, yeah!

1253
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:15,000
M-My greatest gimmick!

1254
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,480
I couldn't even unveil it!

1255
01:25:25,590 --> 01:25:27,110
I'm free!

1256
01:25:27,110 --> 01:25:28,320
--Here you go!
--Thank you!

1257
01:25:31,310 --> 01:25:35,080
--You're not hurt, are you?
--Thank you! You're kind.

1258
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:37,860
--W-Well...
--Take care of Franky, too.

1259
01:25:37,860 --> 01:25:38,880
My pleasure!

1260
01:25:39,770 --> 01:25:41,570
--Brook!
--Sanji!

1261
01:25:41,570 --> 01:25:44,150
Hey, I thought you got captured.

1262
01:25:44,150 --> 01:25:45,530
That was a lie!

1263
01:25:46,110 --> 01:25:48,630
I was the one who called them.

1264
01:25:48,990 --> 01:25:53,750
If I told him that,
he'll lower his guard, I thought!

1265
01:25:53,750 --> 01:25:56,770
And Mushroomconda is a good boy!

1266
01:25:56,790 --> 01:26:02,550
After I made medicine out of
the Rebound Mushrooms, he carried us here!

1267
01:26:02,550 --> 01:26:05,680
Drink this. It's a component of the Rebound Mushroom.

1268
01:26:05,950 --> 01:26:07,390
Here, drink it.

1269
01:26:08,050 --> 01:26:10,780
Somebody, uncuff me, too.

1270
01:26:11,010 --> 01:26:12,700
Boss!

1271
01:26:12,810 --> 01:26:13,540
Here's the key!

1272
01:26:15,980 --> 01:26:18,790
I'm back!

1273
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:25,970
These are the ampules
for Porche and Hamburg.

1274
01:26:25,970 --> 01:26:27,260
Oh, great!

1275
01:26:27,990 --> 01:26:30,470
I feel like I was having a nightmare.

1276
01:26:30,470 --> 01:26:32,310
--He's back!
--Yes!

1277
01:26:32,310 --> 01:26:33,450
Sanji!

1278
01:26:33,910 --> 01:26:36,270
Now I'm free!

1279
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:38,120
--He's back!
--Uh-huh!

1280
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:39,290
Yeah!

1281
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:47,650
All right. Let's do it!

1282
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:49,860
I gotta create some havoc.

1283
01:26:49,860 --> 01:26:52,140
Pirate Hunter, take these!

1284
01:26:54,350 --> 01:26:56,830
Thank you, Split-Head!

1285
01:26:56,830 --> 01:26:59,210
You call me that even now?

1286
01:26:59,210 --> 01:27:01,380
You need these, don't you?!

1287
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:06,990
Super big comeback!

1288
01:27:07,820 --> 01:27:08,740
Luffy!

1289
01:27:08,740 --> 01:27:12,100
--He got shot by Kansho!
--What?!

1290
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:16,110
You're made of rubber so they don't harm you, right?!
Wake up! Luffy!

1291
01:27:16,110 --> 01:27:17,140
Is this for real?

1292
01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:21,210
Oh, if we could've gotten here
a little sooner...

1293
01:27:21,210 --> 01:27:23,790
Oh, boy... It's too late.

1294
01:27:23,790 --> 01:27:26,050
You couldn't turn it around.

1295
01:27:26,050 --> 01:27:28,360
This is how it was supposed to be.

1296
01:27:28,470 --> 01:27:29,570
That bastard!

1297
01:27:32,550 --> 01:27:33,530
It's my voice?!

1298
01:27:34,350 --> 01:27:35,350
What?

1299
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:39,120
Oh, I surprised myself!

1300
01:27:39,230 --> 01:27:41,160
You surprised us!

1301
01:27:41,620 --> 01:27:43,500
What?! I knew I didn't miss!

1302
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:49,220
H-He has the devil's luck!

1303
01:27:51,860 --> 01:27:54,300
Split-Head, sorry. It's broken...

1304
01:27:54,330 --> 01:27:56,410
I really liked it...

1305
01:27:56,410 --> 01:27:57,930
You really liked it?!

1306
01:27:58,500 --> 01:27:59,500
Dammit!

1307
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:03,920
That's impressive!

1308
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:05,880
No way!

1309
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:07,460
You traitor!

1310
01:28:07,460 --> 01:28:09,920
Nine-tails Rush!

1311
01:28:12,510 --> 01:28:14,130
You're next!

1312
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:19,910
--Foxy!
--Boss!

1313
01:28:20,020 --> 01:28:21,250
Stay still!

1314
01:28:23,770 --> 01:28:25,060
Boss!

1315
01:28:25,060 --> 01:28:27,500
--You okay?!
--Don't push yourself.

1316
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:30,220
Thank you, Big Sis... I mean, lady.

1317
01:28:30,530 --> 01:28:33,410
Don't mention it.
It's just payback for what you did earlier.

1318
01:28:33,410 --> 01:28:35,030
Lady...?

1319
01:28:35,030 --> 01:28:35,890
Never mind.

1320
01:28:39,910 --> 01:28:41,080
Guys!

1321
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:42,620
Let's get off of this island!

1322
01:28:42,620 --> 01:28:43,390
Yeah!

1323
01:28:43,540 --> 01:28:45,910
Hey, Split-Head Fox-taro!

1324
01:28:45,910 --> 01:28:47,000
Who are you calling?!

1325
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,050
Your friends are in there.

1326
01:28:49,050 --> 01:28:52,180
That tower, huh?! Thanks, great cook!

1327
01:28:52,180 --> 01:28:53,970
--Let's go!
--Yeah!

1328
01:28:53,970 --> 01:28:57,220
Pickles! Big Bun!
You take care of stuff here!

1329
01:28:57,220 --> 01:28:57,990
Yeah!

1330
01:29:03,850 --> 01:29:05,380
Oni... Giri!

1331
01:29:13,060 --> 01:29:16,570
You have such amazing survival power
and the devil's luck. I'm impressed.

1332
01:29:16,570 --> 01:29:22,730
I thought I was being cautious enough
but your friends totally got the better of me.

1333
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:29,250
But this isn't over yet!
You're still in my hands!

1334
01:29:29,250 --> 01:29:32,740
I won't let you escape!
You can't get out of here alive...

1335
01:29:32,740 --> 01:29:33,700
Heat Egg!

1336
01:29:41,810 --> 01:29:43,640
How do you like it?

1337
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:46,170
It's called "Flare Maneuver"!

1338
01:29:46,190 --> 01:29:47,060
FLARE MANEUVER

1339
01:29:47,980 --> 01:29:50,290
Your taste is nowhere near mine!

1340
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:53,190
Forget it!
I'm not good at those things!

1341
01:29:53,190 --> 01:29:54,570
I won't forgive evil!

1342
01:29:54,570 --> 01:29:59,360
So that people can get serenity
and everlasting peace!

1343
01:30:10,090 --> 01:30:10,940
Oh, no!

1344
01:30:11,170 --> 01:30:12,760
The outer rim is...!

1345
01:30:15,420 --> 01:30:18,660
This basin is below sea level.

1346
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:23,120
I didn't want to use this last strategy
but I had no choice.

1347
01:30:23,350 --> 01:30:25,350
He gave up the Navy base!

1348
01:30:25,350 --> 01:30:27,210
--Nami, take everybody!
--Uh-huh!

1349
01:30:27,350 --> 01:30:30,540
Bang! Bang! Bang!

1350
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:40,280
The seawater keeps pouring in!

1351
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:43,470
Tsk! He won't stop targeting
Devil Fruit eaters!

1352
01:30:43,470 --> 01:30:44,350
It's here!

1353
01:30:44,540 --> 01:30:46,980
I'm gonna create more and more havoc!

1354
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:50,000
Haven't had enough
for the humiliation I bore!

1355
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,520
Both of you, wrap it up.
We'll leave the rest to Luffy!

1356
01:30:55,380 --> 01:30:57,720
It's so spectacular!

1357
01:30:57,720 --> 01:31:03,390
Fan guy! This is a Navy base, isn't it?
They'll get mad at you, won't they?

1358
01:31:03,390 --> 01:31:07,330
They will.
But that's none of your concern.

1359
01:31:07,690 --> 01:31:13,190
I'll take any punishment!
If I can capture the Straw Hats,

1360
01:31:13,190 --> 01:31:14,500
I can't ask for more!

1361
01:31:15,070 --> 01:31:19,430
Seems like I really can't get out of here
without taking you down.

1362
01:31:19,610 --> 01:31:21,680
Let's make a dash for the Sunny!

1363
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:31,980
Already here?!

1364
01:31:36,130 --> 01:31:38,770
You're quite off, aren't you?

1365
01:31:38,770 --> 01:31:41,530
--Not as bad as your pervy eyebrows.
--Hurry up!

1366
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:46,490
Beam! Beam!

1367
01:31:47,350 --> 01:31:49,910
Beam! Beam!

1368
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:54,090
Slow-Slow-Beam! Slower! Slower!

1369
01:31:56,190 --> 01:31:58,460
Slow-Slow Beam!

1370
01:32:01,860 --> 01:32:03,860
Porche! Hamburg!

1371
01:32:04,410 --> 01:32:05,740
Are you okay?!

1372
01:32:05,740 --> 01:32:07,500
Boss...?

1373
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:10,810
Sorry to keep you waiting!
I'm here to save you!

1374
01:32:11,070 --> 01:32:13,580
He came all the way?

1375
01:32:15,420 --> 01:32:17,550
Boss!

1376
01:32:17,550 --> 01:32:20,930
Oh, I'm sorry that
you had to go through this.

1377
01:32:20,930 --> 01:32:23,090
--We don't have time!
--You're right.

1378
01:32:23,090 --> 01:32:26,060
You guys, drink this. Here.

1379
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:30,960
Ooh! I'm back!

1380
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:33,020
--There they are!
--Catch them!

1381
01:32:33,020 --> 01:32:35,360
Slow-Slow Beam!

1382
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:36,460
Again?!

1383
01:32:37,900 --> 01:32:40,510
--Oh, he moves!
--You bastards!

1384
01:32:40,570 --> 01:32:41,720
Shut up!

1385
01:32:41,720 --> 01:32:46,080
What's going on out there?
They took the three of them somewhere...

1386
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:49,810
Straw Hat is fighting outside!
They're wreaking havoc together!

1387
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:52,170
Now, we gotta get out of here!

1388
01:32:52,170 --> 01:32:54,210
Boss, you can go ahead.

1389
01:32:55,170 --> 01:32:57,820
There's something we want to
take back at any price!

1390
01:32:57,920 --> 01:32:59,380
What is it?!

1391
01:32:59,380 --> 01:33:01,690
We'll catch up on you in a bit.

1392
01:33:03,130 --> 01:33:05,920
Hey! I took the trouble to save you...

1393
01:33:06,970 --> 01:33:09,850
You guys can go ahead and run!
I'll look after them...

1394
01:33:09,850 --> 01:33:11,520
What are you talking about?

1395
01:33:12,070 --> 01:33:16,210
We're friends! We'll stay with you
even to the nethermost hell!

1396
01:33:16,690 --> 01:33:18,880
You guys...

1397
01:33:20,740 --> 01:33:24,430
Now you can't exercise
all your power again.

1398
01:33:24,950 --> 01:33:28,030
It's better for you to get caught
without resistance.

1399
01:33:28,030 --> 01:33:32,140
I'll get out of here after I get my friends back.
Don't make me repeat myself!

1400
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:34,980
Enough with your lip!

1401
01:33:38,710 --> 01:33:40,090
Gum-Gum...

1402
01:33:40,090 --> 01:33:41,770
...Pistol!

1403
01:33:42,490 --> 01:33:43,860
Double shot!

1404
01:33:45,470 --> 01:33:47,220
Stamp!

1405
01:33:54,020 --> 01:33:55,330
That was close!

1406
01:33:55,940 --> 01:33:57,540
How tenacious.

1407
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:02,090
But you're obviously moving slow.

1408
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:07,390
I'll never come back to an island like this!

1409
01:34:25,550 --> 01:34:28,110
Your time is up, literally.

1410
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:31,850
The water has stopped rising?

1411
01:34:31,850 --> 01:34:33,850
Oh, Choppy!

1412
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:38,480
--You two made it out, too.
--Hey, let's get out of here quick!

1413
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:41,250
Hey, Straw Hats!
What in the world is going on here?

1414
01:34:41,250 --> 01:34:42,650
Oh, no!

1415
01:34:42,650 --> 01:34:47,050
Oh! Wait, I've got a good...
I mean, a bad idea!

1416
01:34:47,050 --> 01:34:50,350
Hey, Cyborg! Carry me on your shoulder!

1417
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:07,990
Yo! I found a good place to stand!

1418
01:35:09,340 --> 01:35:13,060
Quit life as a pirate and go join a circus!

1419
01:35:19,350 --> 01:35:21,730
Slow-Slow Beam!

1420
01:35:24,150 --> 01:35:25,880
--Split-Head!
--You...

1421
01:35:25,370 --> 01:35:28,570
Slow-Slow Beam!

1422
01:35:28,570 --> 01:35:31,050
How did you like it, you fool?!

1423
01:35:31,050 --> 01:35:33,390
Hey! Hit the bullet all you want!

1424
01:35:33,870 --> 01:35:38,140
Even though you got weaker by the seawater,
if you go "more-more" like I do,

1425
01:35:38,140 --> 01:35:39,830
you can be very powerful!

1426
01:35:39,830 --> 01:35:42,960
Your head is split but you're smart!

1427
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:43,920
Okay!

1428
01:35:46,550 --> 01:35:49,070
Alright, is it good now?
Let's go to the ship!

1429
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:52,720
More! More, more, more, more!

1430
01:35:52,720 --> 01:35:55,450
More, more, more, more! More, more, more!

1431
01:35:55,810 --> 01:35:57,680
Choppy!

1432
01:35:58,060 --> 01:36:00,870
More, more, more, more, more, more, more!

1433
01:36:03,150 --> 01:36:04,770
30 seconds!

1434
01:36:06,150 --> 01:36:07,400
It's hot!

1435
01:36:14,620 --> 01:36:16,240
The water's draining!

1436
01:36:16,240 --> 01:36:17,960
He did it!

1437
01:36:25,130 --> 01:36:27,440
Gum-Gum Pitfall!

1438
01:36:28,170 --> 01:36:28,860
What?!

1439
01:36:29,420 --> 01:36:31,920
You love pitfalls, don't you?

1440
01:36:32,550 --> 01:36:35,810
You've been taking Split-Head for a fool,
haven't you?

1441
01:36:35,810 --> 01:36:38,870
How does it feel like to be brought down
by such a guy?

1442
01:36:39,230 --> 01:36:42,120
The seawater's gone now! Here I go!

1443
01:36:42,140 --> 01:36:44,710
Don't underestimate me,
a Navy HQ vice admiral!

1444
01:36:47,690 --> 01:36:48,900
Drop dead!

1445
01:36:54,870 --> 01:36:58,700
You're very tough as I thought
but far from the best condition.

1446
01:36:58,700 --> 01:37:01,430
I'll bury you with my Haki!

1447
01:37:01,790 --> 01:37:05,460
I don't mind that you hate pirates.
You belong to the Navy after all.

1448
01:37:05,460 --> 01:37:08,420
But I won't let you touch my friends!

1449
01:37:08,420 --> 01:37:11,780
I'm gonna continue the adventure with them!

1450
01:37:13,050 --> 01:37:16,720
I'm tired of having a fruitless conversation.

1451
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:19,520
Let's settle this!

1452
01:37:28,610 --> 01:37:29,420
What?!

1453
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:33,930
Gum-Gum...

1454
01:37:35,450 --> 01:37:37,970
...Red Hawk!

1455
01:37:55,470 --> 01:37:56,590
He did it!

1456
01:37:56,590 --> 01:37:58,760
--Hey, let's get to the ship!
--Yeah!

1457
01:37:58,760 --> 01:38:00,770
--Hurry up!
--O-Okay!

1458
01:38:00,770 --> 01:38:03,450
Boss! Run!

1459
01:38:05,770 --> 01:38:06,920
You...

1460
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:10,040
Pirate...

1461
01:38:11,570 --> 01:38:13,400
Defeat...

1462
01:38:15,030 --> 01:38:17,450
Hey, we left Straw Hat behind.

1463
01:38:17,450 --> 01:38:19,990
Don't worry! He'll be here any minute.

1464
01:38:19,990 --> 01:38:22,500
The problem is the warships on standby.

1465
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:25,670
It's best if we can get away
by the Coup de Burst but...

1466
01:38:25,670 --> 01:38:28,330
We already used it on our way here.

1467
01:38:28,330 --> 01:38:31,070
--Oh, then, there is no problem!
--What?

1468
01:38:31,960 --> 01:38:34,050
We brought them from the base!

1469
01:38:34,050 --> 01:38:36,180
When did you get here?

1470
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:39,510
All we gotta do is wait for Luffy...

1471
01:38:39,510 --> 01:38:40,870
He's here.

1472
01:38:56,700 --> 01:38:58,740
Alright, set sail!

1473
01:39:03,450 --> 01:39:04,520
I see.

1474
01:39:04,910 --> 01:39:06,370
What about Komei and the others?

1475
01:39:06,370 --> 01:39:10,500
We brought all of them on board the warship
that was on standby. The vice admiral, too.

1476
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:13,670
--Okay. Thank you for your trouble.
--Yes, ma'am.

1477
01:39:13,670 --> 01:39:14,880
Clank.

1478
01:39:15,380 --> 01:39:19,050
He pushed them quite far. What a shame.

1479
01:39:19,050 --> 01:39:22,200
Your grandson always gets in our way.

1480
01:39:24,390 --> 01:39:29,310
Even in this era of the contest of strength,
if you have ingenuity, you can compete.

1481
01:39:29,310 --> 01:39:33,150
Komei said he wants to prove it
to all the people in the world.

1482
01:39:33,150 --> 01:39:39,380
Oh, it's him! I remember thinking
"He's so spindly. Will he be okay?"

1483
01:39:39,950 --> 01:39:44,350
I'm newly assigned! I'm Corporal Komei!

1484
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:49,920
His belief in not wanting to
depend on Devil Fruits.

1485
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:52,130
I sort of like it.

1486
01:39:52,130 --> 01:39:56,780
Don't worry! He won't break down
because he lost this time! He's not that wimpy!

1487
01:39:59,630 --> 01:40:02,390
Stop laughing without a care in the world.

1488
01:40:05,140 --> 01:40:08,520
It's all rebuilt.
What will you do about the ship?

1489
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:14,770
We'll sail it. Even though they touched it.
That guy Dojaku didn't cut corners at least.

1490
01:40:14,770 --> 01:40:18,300
Yeah? Well,
that ship is cool so that's good.

1491
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:24,640
The most important thing for me is them
and we took back the next most important thing, too.

1492
01:40:27,950 --> 01:40:30,810
Oh, the Jolly Roger that I drew!

1493
01:40:30,870 --> 01:40:38,010
FOX

1494
01:40:31,170 --> 01:40:35,040
I didn't even wanna look at
this annoying symbol but...

1495
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:38,010
...I'm starting to feel this isn't so bad.

1496
01:40:38,340 --> 01:40:42,130
Feels like we can't call ourselves
the Foxy Pirates without it.

1497
01:40:42,130 --> 01:40:45,850
I see! I feel happy
when someone appreciates what I did.

1498
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:49,890
Thank you for fighting with me.

1499
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:58,190
But the temporary cease-fire ends now!

1500
01:40:58,900 --> 01:41:02,490
From this moment on,
we're each other's enemy again!

1501
01:41:02,490 --> 01:41:04,670
Slow-Slow Beam!

1502
01:41:06,990 --> 01:41:08,350
It doesn't work.

1503
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:10,560
Because I'm made of rubber.

1504
01:41:11,410 --> 01:41:13,120
Just kidding!

1505
01:41:14,250 --> 01:41:15,960
Nice try!

1506
01:41:16,540 --> 01:41:21,440
I thought that's what you'd do.
I knew you.

1507
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:23,630
Thunderbolt...

1508
01:41:23,630 --> 01:41:25,150
...Tempo!

1509
01:41:26,010 --> 01:41:27,580
Boss!

1510
01:41:27,850 --> 01:41:28,930
Boy!

1511
01:41:29,770 --> 01:41:32,440
You're so stupid! That's funny!

1512
01:41:37,230 --> 01:41:39,570
See you, Straw Hat!

1513
01:41:39,570 --> 01:41:42,470
You were as awesome as always!

1514
01:41:42,710 --> 01:41:46,530
Let's have a Davy Back Fight
next time for sure!

1515
01:41:46,530 --> 01:41:48,990
What?! I don't want it!

1516
01:41:48,990 --> 01:41:52,480
--I'm interested.
--What?!

1517
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:55,710
I wanna have one for the first time in decades.

1518
01:41:55,710 --> 01:42:00,320
You guys can say that because
you didn't experience that nonsensicalness.

1519
01:42:02,610 --> 01:42:05,990
Mushroomconda! Bye-bye!

1520
01:42:06,010 --> 01:42:10,540
Saying goodbye to an animal
always cuts me to the bone.

1521
01:42:10,640 --> 01:42:13,450
See you! Split-Head!

1522
01:42:14,140 --> 01:42:17,480
That jerk... He called me that at the very last moment!

1523
01:42:17,480 --> 01:42:19,070
Boss...

1524
01:42:22,570 --> 01:42:26,470
I'll find and save my friends at any cost!

1525
01:42:26,470 --> 01:42:27,940
Come on board!

1526
01:42:30,120 --> 01:42:31,870
Boss?

1527
01:42:31,870 --> 01:42:33,410
It's nothing.

1528
01:42:33,410 --> 01:42:37,000
I'm so glad to have you two back, too!

1529
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:38,420
Boss...

1530
01:42:38,420 --> 01:42:43,480
We've been through a lot
but let's rebuild the Foxy Pirates!

1531
01:42:44,420 --> 01:42:45,510
Okay!

1532
01:42:47,550 --> 01:42:52,100
We're pirates. We're free to seek
whatever adventure we want.

1533
01:42:52,100 --> 01:42:54,980
I'll go my own way!

1534
01:42:54,980 --> 01:42:56,250
O-Okay...

1535
01:42:57,100 --> 01:42:59,940
He's trying to decide on something...

1536
01:42:59,940 --> 01:43:04,760
I'll tell you this and that later.
In any case...!

1537
01:43:05,010 --> 01:43:07,300
You guys!

1538
01:43:07,980 --> 01:43:10,490
We aren't gonna stop yet!

1539
01:43:10,490 --> 01:43:13,430
Let's go merrily and greedily!

1540
01:43:13,430 --> 01:43:15,260
Yeah!

1541
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:19,560
Let's have a banquet celebrating our comeback!

1542
01:43:22,040 --> 01:43:25,120
Good! Only Sanji can cook like this!

1543
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:28,630
Well, I caused you all trouble so eat a lot!

1544
01:43:28,630 --> 01:43:32,640
You did! You don't know how hard it was
to find the Rebound Mushroom!

1545
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:34,060
I'm so sorry...

1546
01:43:34,060 --> 01:43:37,730
Boy! You're a hopeless letch.

1547
01:43:37,730 --> 01:43:41,630
Oh! Robin-chan, you look wonderful
even when you're being so harsh!

1548
01:43:42,690 --> 01:43:45,300
What's so funny,
you drowsy moss ball?!

1549
01:43:45,850 --> 01:43:48,660
Don't try to pick a fight with me
just because she hit you with the truth!

1550
01:43:49,860 --> 01:43:51,640
Cut it out, you two!

1551
01:43:51,910 --> 01:43:53,490
Okay...

1552
01:43:54,160 --> 01:43:58,710
That drowsy look on you two was so funny!

1553
01:43:58,710 --> 01:44:01,450
That vice admiral...
You think he'll come back?

1554
01:44:01,450 --> 01:44:03,670
Hmmm...
I think he'll come back for revenge.

1555
01:44:03,670 --> 01:44:05,760
I'll accept his challenge
as many times as I have to!

1556
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:07,970
If it weren't for that mushroom!

1557
01:44:07,970 --> 01:44:10,890
I'm glad that it only grows on that island.

1558
01:44:10,890 --> 01:44:13,830
Zoro, there's something
in your belly-warmer...

1559
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:20,690
--Oh, that time, it...
--Don't come near! Go away!

1560
01:44:20,690 --> 01:44:22,020
--Zoro, pass!
--Stop it! Pass!

1561
01:44:22,020 --> 01:44:23,980
--No! Toss!
--Enough!

1562
01:44:23,980 --> 01:44:25,530
This is fun!
