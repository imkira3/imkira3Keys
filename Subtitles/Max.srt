1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,563
Okay, Max. Go search.

3
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,847
Careful, Max.

4
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,050
Coast clear?

5
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,210
Good to go.

6
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,120
- Sir, just move to the circle.
- All right, let's go.

7
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:32,247
- Come on. Come on.
- Outside the door. Outside the door.

8
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,647
All right. Back up. Back up.

9
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,289
Why is it just a bunch of old people?
Where are the young studs?

10
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,004
We have surveillance of this village.

11
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,568
We know you're selling weapons
to the Taliban. Where is your supply?

12
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,724
Calm down. Ma'am, calm down.

13
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,402
Well, look what we have here.

14
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,964
We hit the jackpot.

15
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,808
Attaboy, Max. Attaboy.

16
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,483
Mom, I know it's been
too long since we last talked.

17
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,200
They doubled our patrols,
but it's paying off.

18
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,483
Our battalion's never had a find
like this. We owe it all to Max.

19
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,728
We're so proud of you both.

20
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,524
Oh, you hear that, Max? Say "hi."

21
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,122
- Hi. Can he see me?
- Yeah, of course he can, Mom.

22
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,445
Come on. We're just an ocean of pixels
in a dog's eyes, Pam.

23
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,450
- Hey, Dad. How you doing?
- I'm good, Kyle.

24
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,610
- You shouldn't mess with your mother like that.
- Yes, sir. Sorry.

25
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,088
- What'd y'all dig up over there?
- The usual. Just a lot more of it.

26
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,046
You know, RPGs, AKs. A lot of Russian
junk left over from the '80s.

27
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,881
I'd trade that M-4 for one of those
Russian AKs any day of the week.

28
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,889
- I'll run that up the flagpole, sir.
- Well...

29
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,926
Anyway, I think both of you
deserve a medal or something.

30
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,886
Yeah. Kyle's so awesome,
even his fricking dog's a hero.

31
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,367
Feet off the table.
No cussing in this house.

32
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,171
- I didn't cuss.
- You can't hide the words in your mind...

33
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,687
from God by switching letters
in your mouth.

34
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,884
- You think he cares what I got in my mind?
- Hey. Cut it out.

35
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,686
They ask me how I sleep so good
in a war zone.

36
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,962
You can sleep
because I got your back, K-dog.

37
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,884
- Well, hi.
- Hey, Tyler.

38
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,282
You still wrestling
with that kitchen sink?

39
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,403
Yeah, but I think it's about to tap out.

40
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,047
- You boys keeping out of trouble?
- Still making trouble, Ms. W.

41
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,403
- Now I'm just bringing it down on the bad guys.
- Hoorah.

42
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,887
- Waste them all. Let God sort them out.
- Hey.

43
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,811
- Hoorah.
- Boys, we need you to report to command.

44
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,971
- Hey, Mom, I gotta go. Okay? I love you.
- Oh, all right.

45
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,050
- Well, okay. Bye. We love you. Love you.
- Be safe.

46
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,290
Justin, come say goodbye
to your brother.

47
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,046
- Justin.
- Hey, Mom. Just leave him be, okay?

48
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,129
I'm just dealing
with a minor insurgency.

49
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,931
He's trying to save the whole universe.

50
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:55,244
This is the weapons cache
your unit uncovered. Is that correct?

51
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,001
- Yes, sir.
- And this is the field report.

52
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,444
And there are several more weapons
in the photos than are listed in the report.

53
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,803
- Not enough to set off alarm bells.
- This is not the first time...

54
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,685
we've noted discrepancies
in your unit's field reports.

55
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,764
After a while,
a trickle turns into a stream.

56
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,169
Anything you want to tell us, Marine?

57
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,328
I just handle the dog, sir.

58
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,250
Sergeant Harne,
step inside, front and center.

59
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,482
Sergeant Harne reporting, sir.

60
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,891
Can you believe those office pogues
coming at us like that?

61
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,527
- We're putting our lives on the line for them.
- Ty, this ain't fifth grade.

62
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,516
I can't cover for you like that here.

63
00:07:42,616 --> 00:07:46,156
Until yesterday, I had no idea
what you were doing.

64
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,200
You crossed the line.
Put the brakes on it or I will.

65
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,046
- Kyle, it's me you're talking to.
- When are you gon...

66
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,604
What's he got?

67
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:09,003
- Wants us to stay put.
- No. We have our orders. Move him out.

68
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,809
Max.

69
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,049
- Everybody down!
- Take cover! Take cover!

70
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,645
Max!

71
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,963
Tyler!

72
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,208
Tyler!

73
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,728
- Smith, Rodrigues, with me!
- Henderson, March, go, go, go!

74
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,440
- I can't see it! I can't see it!
- I'm blind!

75
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,120
All right, everybody, move up! Move up!

76
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,044
Where's Wincott?

77
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,008
- Sarge!
- I got him, I got him.

78
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,929
Easy, Max.

79
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,122
Easy. I got you, Max.

80
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,527
All right. There's no security codes
or encryptions or anything like that on it.

81
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,650
- Yeah, I get it. You're proud of your work, B.
- Whoa, whoa.

82
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,844
I want an extra 200 for this one.
Okay? Tell Emilio that.

83
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,883
- You said what?
- I heard he's selling...

84
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,731
that "Assassin's Creed" I ripped
all the way in Austin.

85
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,764
You don't want beef with my cousin.
You know what I'm saying?

86
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,531
Look, man, 200 more
or this is gonna be the last one.

87
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,931
Oh, hey, Mr. Wincott. Gotta go.
Be seeing you later, Justin. Peace out.

88
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,129
Okay.

89
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,442
Come here.

90
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,122
- What are you doing?
- Hanging out.

91
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,130
I thought I was gonna see you at work
this morning, 8 a.m.

92
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,008
And waste my summer?
Sweeping floors for 8 bucks an hour?

93
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,569
You'd rather sit in your room on your butt,
playing video games? That suit you better?

94
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,141
It's better than renting
storage for junk...

95
00:10:30,241 --> 00:10:32,212
people should've thrown out
in the first place.

96
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,006
That junk puts food in your mouth,
smart guy.

97
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,964
And I don't just run it, I own it.

98
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,245
A lot of people around here, they gotta
punch a time clock. I'm my own boss.

99
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,164
- Yeah, well, you ain't mine.
- What's that?

100
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,402
Stay here, Justin.

101
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,925
Dad.

102
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,250
- Stay here.
- Dad, what are they doing here?

103
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,050
Dad.

104
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:28,762
Nearer, my God, to thee

105
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:34,763
Nearer to thee

106
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,087
E'en though it be a cross

107
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:47,367
That raiseth me

108
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,447
Still all my song shall be...

109
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,886
Nearer, my God, to thee

110
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,647
Ma'am. Sir.

111
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,770
Sorry I'm so late.
I trained your son and his dog at Maitland.

112
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,681
They sent Max back for an eval. Figured
since we were only a short drive away...

113
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,804
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

114
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:04,766
Though like the wanderer

115
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:10,330
The sun gone down

116
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,523
We gotta go, Max. Come on.

117
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,967
I'm sorry.
He was trained better than this.

118
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,083
Come on, Max.

119
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,884
I know how he feels.

120
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,531
Max.

121
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,720
Excuse me, son. Who might you be?

122
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,291
It's Justin. Kyle's brother.

123
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,207
I guess Max already figured that out.

124
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,051
You wanna help us
get him back to the van?

125
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,402
Might go a lot easier if you did.

126
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,769
Thank you.

127
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,520
Here comes the hard part.

128
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,802
A lot to learn from there.

129
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,449
- About what?
- About becoming a man.

130
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,361
Enlisting? Getting killed like Kyle?

131
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,007
Getting my leg shot up like you?
What would that prove?

132
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,568
You speak of Kyle, you speak respectfully.
Do you understand me?

133
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,609
He didn't have to prove anything
to anybody.

134
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,486
You think Kyle wasn't trying
to prove himself to you?

135
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,923
All Kyle ever did was try to prove himself
to you. And if he didn't...

136
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,726
- bet he would have never joined.
- What would you know?

137
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,241
You never sacrificed anything,
much less your life.

138
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,010
- Guys.
- You'd like me to do that?

139
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,651
Guys!

140
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,730
They're gonna kill Max.

141
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,249
Animals can come down with
post traumatic stress same as people can.

142
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,650
Max bonded so closely with Kyle, it's proven
impossible to get him to follow orders...

143
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,041
from anyone else.

144
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:40,201
He can't handle sharp noises anymore,
gunshots, explosions send him into a panic.

145
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,129
These dogs were bred to work.

146
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,041
Take away that sense of purpose
and they're lost.

147
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,802
Max can't serve here
and he's a danger everywhere else.

148
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,008
Well, this family takes care of its own.

149
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,571
How we doing, Max?

150
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,369
Go on.

151
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,131
Hey.

152
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,325
Remember me?

153
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,127
You sure you wanna do this?

154
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,524
Yeah.

155
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,287
Okay. Slowly.

156
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,329
No sudden moves.

157
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,166
That's a cool toy. Right?

158
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,124
How do I get him to sit?

159
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,251
Better focus on giving him that kong while
keeping your hand attached to your wrist.

160
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,286
I mean, like what... What do I do
with my hand to get him to...

161
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,364
Sit.

162
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,683
Sit.

163
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,089
Good. Psycho hound.

164
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,843
Good boy.

165
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,805
Just enjoy that in peace.

166
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,647
Okay, sergeant.
We'll be taking him home.

167
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,567
Do we have to tie him up?
I feel bad for him.

168
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,369
He's too unstable
to stay in the house...

169
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,927
and I can't have him
running around loose.

170
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,647
- Why don't we just build a fence?
- That's a great idea.

171
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,371
- Easy, Max. Easy, easy. Easy.
- Who's gonna pay for it? You?

172
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,050
No.

173
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,766
If you do, I'll trick the neighborhood kids
into whitewashing it.

174
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,204
- Ha, ha. You sure this one's ours?
- I got the stretch marks to prove it.

175
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,887
- Here.
- Careful, honey.

176
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,531
Okay. Well...

177
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,802
let's you and me
go get this dog some dinner.

178
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,121
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

179
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,529
I did not sign on
to babysit Kyle's crazy dog.

180
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,767
Hey.

181
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,130
Kyle's gone.
So this dog is officially your dog.

182
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,761
Do you understand?

183
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,930
Your brother loved you so much,
more than you'll ever know.

184
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,846
If he did, he wouldn't have left me here
to deal with Dad all by myself.

185
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,050
Your father loves you too.

186
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,164
Just none of you Wincott boys
are very good at showing it.

187
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,971
If you wanna buck that trend,
I sure could use a hug right about now.

188
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,410
He'll tire himself out.

189
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:50,209
That's what you said about Justin
and he hasn't quit barking yet.

190
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,007
Justin! Get that dog to shut up!

191
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:04,600
Hey. Hey. Dude, seriously,
this is how it's gonna be?

192
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,521
Yeah. Okay. Sit.

193
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,002
Easy, boy. Easy.

194
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:23,166
Okay. Good boy.

195
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,004
Right.

196
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,046
Well, see you in the morning, I guess.

197
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,243
What is wrong with you?

198
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,091
- Justin!
- Oh, my God. Look, I'm trying!

199
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,886
Shut that dog up before
I come out there with my .45!

200
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,602
Man, come on over.
You'll be doing me a favor!

201
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,447
What do you want, Max?

202
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:14,246
What? What, do you want me to stay?
I can't stay out here all night.

203
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,523
Sit. Sit.

204
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,482
All right. Fine.

205
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,565
Just till you fall asleep.

206
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,606
Good morning.

207
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,408
Sweetheart, good morning.

208
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,447
I was looking all over for you.
You been out here all night?

209
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,008
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Your friend called. What's his name? Chuy.

210
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,010
He says it's urgent.
You gotta call him back.

211
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,683
Oh. If you want me to start going
to the bathroom out here, I can do that too.

212
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,605
Sounds good to me,
as long as you pick up after yourself.

213
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,247
- Yo, Justin! What's up?
- Hey, Justin!

214
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,283
Hey, what's up, dude?

215
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,523
- Yo, half the bikes here are mountain.
- All right. Do a trick.

216
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,404
- I just do trails.
- Heh. What trails, man?

217
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,490
- I don't see you doing trails.
- Hey. Hey.

218
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,887
Hey, what's up, man?
Yo, Justin, how you ride?

219
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,687
- Like this?
- Yo, shut up, man.

220
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,362
- Yo, sorry to call your house, but...
- Emilio was breathing down your neck?

221
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,887
- Because you never gave him...
- Is this the new one?

222
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,286
That's for Emilio.

223
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,966
You took off like your pants were
on fire when my dad came out.

224
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:28,050
- I don't mess with no war heroes, B.
- War heroes?

225
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,608
I heard your pops got his leg shot up
in a crazy firefight in 'Nam.

226
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,041
It was Iraq. But whatever.

227
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,691
Yo, he was like:

228
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,409
Cool under fire, huh?

229
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:49,602
- No, we... It's like a, um...
- And that's my cousin, Carmen.

230
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,286
Why you looking at me like that?
Think I should look like the maid?

231
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,848
Should I be wearing an apron?
Or no, maybe overalls would be better, huh?

232
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,166
Ooh.

233
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,647
- You got a lot of cousins.
- Tell me about it.

234
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,810
She's staying with us, man.
I can't even sit on my own couch, B.

235
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,809
My uncle chased her out with a machete.

236
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,321
Why you always making up stories
all the time?

237
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,682
Wait, what happened?

238
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,566
- Oh, yo, check it out.
- That's cool.

239
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:21,402
We were at dinner. Pop told me
to have it removed or he'd do it for me.

240
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,366
So I slid over my knife,
said, "Go ahead."

241
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:30,407
He got up, called my aunt, told her
he didn't wanna see me anymore.

242
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,126
So she said for me to come over.

243
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,368
End of story.

244
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,006
Trust me, machetes were involved.

245
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,808
- Come on, B. Ride with us.
- No. I gotta go take care of that dog, so...

246
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,890
Yo, your brother's war dog, right?
I heard he's loco, homes.

247
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,721
My cousin Felix works up at the church,
said he tore up like 10 Marines.

248
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,969
- Put them in the hospital.
- He didn't put anybody in the hospital.

249
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,686
You got an MWD? What kind?

250
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,928
- What kind?
- Your dog. What breed is he?

251
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,207
Oh.

252
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:07,442
Yeah, um. He's like a German shepherd.
Like black in his face.

253
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,642
- Belgian Malinois.
- Mallen-what?

254
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,410
Cool dog.

255
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,162
He's crazy, actually. I'm the only one he'll
let near him. Won't even let me touch him.

256
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,681
Just gotta be patient with him.
He'll come around.

257
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,521
She's like the chick version of Cesar Millan.
Got the mustache and everything.

258
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,171
Don't touch me.

259
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,608
Hey. If you want, I can come over
and show you a few tricks.

260
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,047
Ooh.

261
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,130
Yeah, sure. Why not?

262
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,807
How about later, so I can cook up
some treats? Say, 3:00?

263
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,331
- Cool.
- Cool.

264
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,966
- What just happened?
- You're stupid. That's what just happened.

265
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,126
Hey. Easy.

266
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,483
Yo. That dog reminds me of your pops.

267
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,920
Maybe this was a bad idea.

268
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,011
Pink Floyd.
You're one of those deep ones, huh?

269
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,722
Hey, there, Max. Like some home cooking?
Smells nice, doesn't it?

270
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:31,244
Hey, I wouldn't get too close to him.

271
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,569
This is close enough for now.
Let him think about it for a minute.

272
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,207
Yo, I'm out. Carmen,
you get bit, it ain't my fault, right?

273
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,368
Hey, no, Chuy. You can stay if you want.

274
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,370
- Not if your mean old man is around.
- He's at work, dude.

275
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:47,565
That man ain't got no love for his light
brown brothers. Know what I'm saying?

276
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,924
That's messed up. The way you let Chuy
hate on your dad like that.

277
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,169
- That's cold.
- Are you serious?

278
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,006
I can say whatever
I want about my old man.

279
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,363
Someone else disrespects him,
go upside their head.

280
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,166
- It's called being loyal.
- It's called being psycho...

281
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,840
so you and Max
should get along pretty well.

282
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,530
I'm not the one
he has to get along with.

283
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:15,216
Don't give this to him
until he lets you touch him.

284
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,289
So how'd you get to be such an expert
in all this? Do you have credentials or...

285
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,609
You gonna eat that carnita
or are you gonna give it to your dog?

286
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,320
- Don't do it, man!
- Chuy.

287
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,525
- Ow. Are you trying to get my boy killed?
- Shut up, Chuy!

288
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:52,203
- Maybe I should just give it to him first.
- No, it's a reward.

289
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,291
You can't get a reward
if you didn't do anything to deserve it.

290
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,450
Okay.

291
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,608
It's a start. You got a leash?

292
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:24,570
Heel. You don't let your dog walk you,
you walk your dog.

293
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:28,970
Dogs run in packs so if he's leading you,
he's leading the pack.

294
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,569
My brother said Max
was like a specialized search dog.

295
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,684
He could go out in front of his handler
for like 300 yards.

296
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,810
Locate weapons and explosives and stuff.

297
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:44,204
Yo, we got the Air Jordan of dogs here, man.
You got him shooting layups?

298
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,166
- Sorry, Chuy. Did you wanna try walking him?
- Heck, no. Are you crazy?

299
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,809
Make sure to keep him
to your left a little bit.

300
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,130
All right, Max, you're such a superstar,
let's see you work off-leash.

301
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:13,005
I don't think it's a good idea. If something
happens, my dad will kill me, so...

302
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:18,280
No guts, no glory.
Now walk with him like you were just doing.

303
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,482
Heel, Max.

304
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,531
Well, I do not believe what I'm seeing.

305
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,361
- How'd you get him to do that?
- He already knew.

306
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,289
We were just refreshing his memory.

307
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,562
Mom, this is Carmen.
She's Chuy's cousin.

308
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,401
- She's, uh, real good with dogs.
- Well, I can see that.

309
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,041
- Nice to meet you, Carmen. Hi, Chuy.
- Ma'am.

310
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,609
I was thinking that, you know,
we could just give Max to her.

311
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,644
No such luck, Chuck. That's your dog.

312
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,401
But I'm fixing to start supper.
If y'all are hungry, you're welcome to stay.

313
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,001
Oh, thanks, ma'am. I'd be glad to.

314
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,801
Thanks. I gotta go home, make sure
the border patrol hasn't invaded my house.

315
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,681
I'll tell my moms gringos have kidnapped
my cousin. Y'all have fun.

316
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,081
Everything's outstanding, Pam.
Thank you.

317
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,521
Yeah, it's really good.

318
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,646
Now, you guys know this is overcooked.

319
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,446
I don't know what happened.
I've made it a hundred times.

320
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:22,325
I put it in and Mary called.
You know how she can get. And, um...

321
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,644
And I just forgot to take it out.

322
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,528
You having fun yet?

323
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,731
I'm so sorry.

324
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:43,450
Carmen, we lost our oldest son recently
and, um...

325
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,487
- Well...
- I'm really sorry.

326
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,727
Thank you.

327
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,084
Why don't you tell us
something about you?

328
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,487
How'd you get to be so good
working with dogs?

329
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,131
Oh, um...

330
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,084
Well, my old ma...

331
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:05,003
My father used to raise pit bulls.
And my brother trains them, so...

332
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,010
Pit bulls?
Does he train them for dog fighting?

333
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,922
My brother rescues strays.

334
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,440
Well, you should see Carmen with Max.

335
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,087
And she's showing Justin how to work
with him too. He's really coming along.

336
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,883
I got it.

337
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,803
My goodness. Wow. Look at you, kid.

338
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,766
- All grown up. How you doing?
- Good.

339
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,769
Can I come in?

340
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,281
- Well...
- I hope it's okay I came by like this.

341
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,046
- I've been home for a couple of days.
- Good to see you.

342
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,164
Good to see you. Well...

343
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:58,166
I just, uh... I wanted to tell you
how sorry I am.

344
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,682
- Glad to see you.
- Me too.

345
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:06,249
- You're back sooner than we expected.
- Yeah. Medical discharge.

346
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:10,684
Got shrapnel all up and down my back.
Got a few pieces lodged in my spine.

347
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,242
Man, makes us a couple
of beat-up old Marines, I guess.

348
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,090
I'm proud to be one alongside you.

349
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,009
You're back just in time for the 4th.

350
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,727
And I'd really like to have you alongside me
marching in the parade.

351
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,641
Doesn't it hurt?
All that metal in your back?

352
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:32,843
Yeah. Uh, well, they got me on so many
meds, I hardly notice it. I'm sorry, you are?

353
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,327
This is Carmen, Justin's friend.

354
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,000
She's... Oh, you know what?

355
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,323
I know somebody else
who'll be glad to see you. Come on.

356
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,921
I'll put these in water
in just a minute.

357
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,603
Here he is.

358
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,841
Max.

359
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,927
- Max, stay!
- Max!

360
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,010
- Stay! Stay! Stay.
- Easy, Max! Max!

361
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,200
Max! Easy. Easy, Max.

362
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,011
I can't believe Max did that, you know?

363
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:43,123
- I mean, after everything that you did with him.
- After everything we did.

364
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,322
- He's your dog.
- Whatever.

365
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,923
You know, dogs are usually
pretty good judges of character.

366
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,329
Then I guess Max likes me pretty well.

367
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,524
Yeah, well, even dogs can make mistakes.

368
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:05,406
Hey, are you gonna be
at the, uh, bike park tomorrow?

369
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,807
Wouldn't you like to know?

370
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,010
Min! No, no, no.

371
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,646
Come on, girl. No!

372
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,047
Yo, Justin!

373
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,481
Justin, got more chores
for you when you're done.

374
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,763
- Yeah, come mow my lawn!
- After that, take my trash out!

375
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,042
Woo-hoo!

376
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,731
Right.

377
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,644
Okay, sit. Max, sit.

378
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:07,129
Max, you mess up now,
you're grounded for life. You understand?

379
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:31,165
My God. Come on, Max.

380
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,960
That's it? No tricks? Flips?

381
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,049
Well, how about you do it?

382
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,366
Hey, Max.

383
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,204
What are you doing off-leash?

384
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,283
You in a better mood today or something?

385
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:02,047
Yo, Justin, I was gonna call you,
but I didn't want to be calling your house.

386
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,250
Get a cell, join the 21 st century.

387
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,487
Ooh. Look at you, girl,
making googly-eyes at that white boy.

388
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,526
- Being a traitor to your race.
- Mexican isn't a race, stupid.

389
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,162
Whoa. You shouldn't be
bringing him out like this.

390
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,842
Heard he tore up your brother's homie.
Had his teeth up at his throat like:

391
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,928
Chuy, sometimes I wish I could be you...

392
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,090
so the world would seem so awesome
all the time.

393
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,045
It is awesome, B.
Y'all just got a bad attitude.

394
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,402
Crazy awesome things
are happening all the time.

395
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,608
- Oh, yeah?
- Yo, Justin!

396
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,565
- We're hitting Cutter's Run.
- Yeah.

397
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,445
- Come on, man.
- I'll catch up in a second.

398
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:45,964
- You're gonna catch up to those guys?
- Yeah. Why not?

399
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:50,728
- What about Max?
- Try and keep up.

400
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,487
It looks like homegirl don't know
my boy Justin too good yet.

401
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,170
I know your boy has problems.

402
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,642
Chores are over, y'all!

403
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,925
Whoa. Aah!

404
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,409
- Yo, Justin, that's Cutter's Doom!
- What's Cutter's Doom?

405
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,370
Justin!

406
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,685
Whoo!

407
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,765
- Crazy white boy!
- What?

408
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,883
Even your dog has more sense than you.

409
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,048
I can't hear you.
Come down here and tell me.

410
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,767
Crazy, B! Justin...

411
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,202
Ow! Girl, that hurts.

412
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,649
Whoo!

413
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,928
Hey, Mom.

414
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,851
What, uh... What's that?

415
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:59,764
Your father put it there while you were gone.
He does not want to argue with you about it.

416
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,928
Who's arguing?

417
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,487
Didn't want Max here in the first place,
remember?

418
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,841
Go on. Max. Max, you heard me. Go on.

419
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,287
Oh, heh.

420
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,007
Max!

421
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,729
Max, it's okay. It's okay.
Easy. Easy, boy. Easy. Shh.

422
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:56,687
It's okay. Hey, hey, hey. It's okay.
It's okay. Easy. It's okay.

423
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,803
Hey. Come on. Come on. Come inside.

424
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,530
Easy.

425
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:09,165
Hey. Hey. Come on. Come on. Come on, Max.
Hey, let's go inside. Let's go inside.

426
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,371
Come on. Let's go inside.
Hey, shh, it's okay.

427
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:16,131
Max, hey. Hey, hey, Max.

428
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:22,691
Hey, Max. It's okay.
I'm coming in, Max. Okay?

429
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,565
I'm coming in. It's okay.

430
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,968
It's okay. It's okay.

431
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,162
It's okay. Easy, easy.

432
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:54,291
It's all right. It's all right.
It's okay.

433
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,850
It's okay.

434
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,691
So we got 25 8-by-10 units over here...

435
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:23,441
and we got 20 6-by-12 units
over on the other side of the lot.

436
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:27,726
Running at about half capacity
right now. Hard times.

437
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:33,360
It's not much compared
to the uniform you're used to.

438
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,961
- I'll be proud to wear it.
- Yeah.

439
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,926
Tyler, the truth is
there's not much to this job.

440
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:43,090
I mean, especially for a young man
with your skill set.

441
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,089
You're gonna be bored out of your mind.

442
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,171
Thank you, sir,
but it doesn't mix with my meds.

443
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:52,967
Excitement's about the last thing I need.
Little boredom suits me just fine.

444
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:56,164
That's why I came to you about the job
in the first place.

445
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:59,284
- No offense intended.
- None taken.

446
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:05,171
So I heard your old man's
over there in Tucson these days.

447
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:10,486
- Yeah, he just finished a stint at state.
- Sorry about that.

448
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,445
Three squares a day,
the way he likes it.

449
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:17,247
You know, if you need a place to stay,
we can fix up that old spare room.

450
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,365
Oh, no. I'm crashing with some buddies.
You've already given me more than I deserve.

451
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:25,201
I just wish there was something
I could do for you in return.

452
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,481
Well, you know, maybe there is.

453
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,841
- I need to know.
- Know what, sir?

454
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,325
How my son died.

455
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,610
Sir, Kyle was the best friend
that I ever had, okay?

456
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:51,842
- He was the bravest Marine that I ever knew.
- Tyler.

457
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:02,443
We were out on that last patrol,
looking for a hajji cache of arms...

458
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:08,130
and that's when it hit the fan.

459
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:14,168
RPGs going off, bullets flying, you name it.
It was like hell on earth.

460
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,931
- And, well, sir, the dog lost it.
- The dog?

461
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:20,488
Yes, sir. You know how Kyle was,
he was trying to keep him calm...

462
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,603
when he should have been taking cover.

463
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,963
Then it went for him,
made him lose control of his weapon.

464
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,322
The next thing I knew Kyle was hit.

465
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:33,048
The dog come at me next, some of the guys
came in and stopped me from doing...

466
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,328
what I should have did.

467
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,688
I'm so sorry.

468
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,643
Sir.

469
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:53,122
- You did the best you could.
- Thank you, sir.

470
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,687
I appreciate it.

471
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:07,920
Well, I'd just as soon be alone now.

472
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,527
Come on, Max.
Let's you and me get in the truck.

473
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,890
Come on. Come on!

474
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:12,086
Don't make me do this here, Max.

475
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:17,762
- Dad.
- Go back in the house, Justin.

476
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,281
What are you doing with that gun?

477
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,723
This dog turned on your brother
and got him killed.

478
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,720
- Says who?
- Tyler. He was there.

479
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:33,170
Dad, Max wouldn't do that.

480
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,722
Justin, you don't know anything
about this animal.

481
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,408
I knew Kyle.

482
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:44,802
Kyle would not have put
his buddies' lives on the line...

483
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,168
by taking point with a dog
he couldn't trust.

484
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,530
Ray. What is going on out here?

485
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,484
Dad.

486
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:15,002
He screws up one time, just one time...

487
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,648
he's gonna get put down.

488
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,763
Do you understand me?

489
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,881
That's the last word on it.

490
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,206
Son.

491
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,730
- Justin. Hey.
- Hey.

492
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,206
- Good to see you.
- You too.

493
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:58,647
- How are your folks doing?
- Good. Good.

494
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,649
How is Max?

495
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:04,891
Um, that's actually what
I wanted to talk to you about.

496
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:08,408
Max was as good a dog
as ever passed through this facility. Why?

497
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:13,764
You think he could have,
like, hurt Kyle in any way?

498
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,925
Dogs can bite their handlers, but I don't
think that's what you're asking me.

499
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,361
I don't know. I mean,
could he have, like, turned on him?

500
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:28,810
In the middle of a battle
or a firefight or something?

501
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,083
What would make you think
something like that?

502
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:39,170
My brother's friend Tyler.
He was with him when he died.

503
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:45,726
And he came home recently. I don't know,
I guess he told my dad some stuff about Max.

504
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,046
- Tyler Harne?
- Yeah.

505
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,846
Did he tell your dad
why he was home five months early?

506
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:55,651
I don't know, I mean,
I guess he got hurt or something.

507
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,201
- That's what he said.
- Or something.

508
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,882
Administrative separation.
It doesn't say anything about an injury.

509
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,320
Uh...

510
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,525
Are you saying he lied?

511
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,888
Well, that's all I could get here. Yeah.

512
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,242
I'll look into it. In the meantime...

513
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,001
This is classified.

514
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:19,406
- So don't get me in trouble, okay?
- Okay.

515
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,125
For your eyes only.

516
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,286
- So, what is it?
- It's top secret, okay?

517
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,847
Hey, no one else can see this.

518
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,491
All right, give it already.

519
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,521
Yo, check out these Mexican dogs, man.

520
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:34,690
Be thinking 10 small dudes
can take down one big one.

521
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,922
It's probably some
kind of military dog...

522
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,849
training instructions so...

523
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,121
That's top secret?

524
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:43,164
I'll tell al Qaeda the Army
feeds our dogs Kibbles 'n Bits.

525
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,203
Be the end of America.

526
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:46,926
You haven't watched it yet?

527
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:49,361
No. I figured I should
watch it with someone...

528
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,967
who could make head or tail of it.

529
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,925
Justin, there's no big secret to this.

530
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:58,602
Max just has to know that you want him,
and there's no faking it.

531
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,610
Or are you one of those guys
who uses his dog to pick up girls?

532
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:07,847
That's the sound of the third wheel
squeaking, yo. This is my house, remember?

533
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:10,520
I'm sorry to interrupt
your important activities...

534
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:14,088
like hiding in your room
and stalking girls on Instagram.

535
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:17,284
Y'all two are making me throw up
in my own mouth.

536
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,721
I'm gonna be out back.

537
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,287
Let's check it out.

538
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,970
Sit. Sit.

539
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:28,165
- Welcome to training school, Max.
- There we go.

540
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,249
Yeah, he's definitely
got some potential.

541
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:35,765
Come on. Yeah, good boy.
Good boy. Come on.

542
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:39,009
- Lead him on, lead him on.
- All right. Here it is.

543
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,168
Ready, go. Up!

544
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,324
- Oh, man, bad hop.
- You got to get over that.

545
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,801
- Here we go, here we go!
- Let him go!

546
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,846
- Good boy. Why don't you give it a shot?
- Yes, sir.

547
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:55,801
Sit. Good. Good boy.

548
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:59,761
- Good job.
- Down. Down. Good boy, Max.

549
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,411
- Is that your brother?
- Yeah.

550
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:05,730
Come. Sit. Good boy. Down.

551
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,048
- If you want, I can go out back.
- It's okay.

552
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,129
- Come. Hold.
- You can stay.

553
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,288
Too quick. Sit.

554
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,365
Looks like you earned his trust.

555
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:18,001
Congratulations, Wincott.

556
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:21,363
- Max is your responsibility now.
- Thank you, sir.

557
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:23,642
Come on, come on. Jump! Good boy!

558
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:26,411
Good job. There we go.

559
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,125
- All right.
- Yeah.

560
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,843
Go search, come on. Search.

561
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,569
Good boy. Search. Search.

562
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:37,331
Max. Search. Search.

563
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:41,367
Good boy. Come on. Dig it out of there!

564
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:44,291
Max, come on. Good boy. Dig. Good boy.

565
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,968
Too fast for me, buddy.

566
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:53,803
And up! Up! Up! Up! Up!

567
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:57,410
Good boy. Yeah.

568
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,085
You got to film my break?

569
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,648
You're supposed to film us
working hard. Right, Max?

570
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:10,881
Good work today, bud. Good work.

571
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:14,446
I should have picked
a shady spot, buddy.

572
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,850
Get out of that sun.

573
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:21,208
- He's a liar.
- Who's a liar?

574
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:25,485
Yo, Justin. Better come outside.

575
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:29,605
No, no, no. Listen, I don't wanna hear
any excuses. Just get my money.

576
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:32,366
Yeah, whatever. Just get my money.

577
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,525
Bye.

578
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,044
Well, well, well.

579
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:40,528
Just making the rounds
and look who turns up. Heh.

580
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:44,042
You know, would have never found
your brother around these parts.

581
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,206
I'm sorry to hear about Kyle, though.
Semper fi.

582
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:51,126
He was the only dude on the wrestling squad
that was able to take me down.

583
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,328
Tried to get him to do business with me.

584
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:57,286
He turned me down cold. I have a feeling
we would have beefed if he came back...

585
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:01,610
so I guess
it's for the best, right? Right?

586
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,406
- If you say so.
- I do say so.

587
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,728
You got some big cojones
asking for that...

588
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:12,329
- extra 200 bills for that game you ripped.
- If it ain't worth it, just don't buy it.

589
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:14,727
You hear that, Chuy?

590
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:17,446
You could pick up some attitude
from this kid.

591
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:20,010
Who's this Morticia-looking mamita?

592
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,645
That's my cousin Carmen.

593
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:24,127
- Your cousin?
- Yeah, on my mom's side.

594
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:25,731
Hey, how about you go, like...

595
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,810
fix your makeup or go put
on a dress or something?

596
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,564
Hey, what's up, Tyler?

597
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,130
Yeah, don't trip.

598
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,243
My people are gonna be there, yeah.

599
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,681
I'm on my way. Bye.

600
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,568
"Total Combat 4"
comes out next Thursday.

601
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,081
You rip that for me at regular rate
and we're good.

602
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:47,725
Otherwise, we're gonna have a problem.

603
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,765
I heard about you.

604
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:55,089
You tore up that squad of Navy SEALs
over at First Baptist.

605
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:57,450
Nice.

606
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,731
Get me that game.

607
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,523
Hey, up... Up front.

608
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,321
By Friday.

609
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,725
Ow! What's that for?

610
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:25,405
Why'd you let him disrespect me?

611
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:29,082
- I didn't hear Justin say anything.
- He happened to be making the rounds?

612
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:32,250
- You told him I was coming.
- He's been on me about that game, yo.

613
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:35,081
Thanks for everything.
I'll call you tomorrow.

614
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,089
You would if you had a phone, fool.

615
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,210
All right, Max. Let's see
what you can do. Go search.

616
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,604
What happened, boy? Did you lose him?

617
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:32,401
Hey, hey. Shh. Shh.

618
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,722
He likes it. Just wants to make sure
you have more than this one RPK-74.

619
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:47,321
Tell him this is strictly show and tell.

620
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,967
- Where are the rest?
- It's stored in a safe place.

621
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,367
We'll deliver it
when half the agreed-on sum...

622
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,050
is deposited into my account.

623
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:59,961
You can tear up a chopper with this.
But if you really wanna take down a bird...

624
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:02,242
Go get the RPG.

625
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:10,571
Hey.

626
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:12,605
Hey, hey. Shh.

627
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:22,249
What's going on?

628
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:24,727
Probably some critter.
Coyote or something.

629
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:32,441
Your boy's good, Emilio?

630
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:35,211
He'll wire the money in the morning.
Don't set him up.

631
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,807
Ain't nobody setting nobody up.

632
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,365
Send them out.

633
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:09,209
That's no coyote.

634
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,285
You all right, boy?

635
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:46,407
What's the matter?

636
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,243
Loki, you gone nuts?!

637
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,687
That's definitely no coyote.

638
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,810
Hey, Max.

639
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:19,127
You scared me, boy.

640
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,728
Come on. Come on, Max. Come on.

641
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:30,128
Sit. Sit.

642
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:39,805
- Are y'all okay?
- No, my dog's hurt and we need a ride.

643
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:43,601
- Get him in the back. We'll take him to the vet.
- Thank you.

644
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:50,805
Come on, let's go.

645
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:58,400
Ma'am, can I, uh...
Can I borrow your phone?

646
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,802
Four hundred and fifty dollars?

647
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,925
Max is okay and that's what matters.

648
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:08,841
- Four hundred and fifty dollars?
- And 47 cents.

649
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:10,804
For shots for a dog?

650
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,844
Man, what you guys charge
for a person, yo? A million dollars?

651
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:16,088
How much money did your mom give you?

652
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:20,080
Give me? She didn't give me jack.
This $100 is my life savings.

653
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:21,850
Your life savings is $100?

654
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:24,003
You don't want it?

655
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:26,487
Yeah. Yeah. Thanks.

656
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:28,967
Sorry. We can't release Max
without full payment.

657
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:30,810
I'm gonna have to call your parents.

658
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,002
Please, ma'am, I'm good for the rest.

659
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:37,000
Just give me time to think about
what I'm gonna tell my dad.

660
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,690
Thank you.

661
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:44,762
What am I gonna tell my dad?

662
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:49,124
If this has anything to do
with Emilio, nothing.

663
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:52,084
I can't do that. Dude.

664
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:55,369
Bro, this man's loco.
Family don't mean dirt to him.

665
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:58,928
If you care about me and Carmen,
then leave us out of it.

666
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:00,681
Come on, Max.

667
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:03,804
Hey, come on. Let's go.
Let's get in the cage, come on.

668
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:08,085
Max, hey, come on. Hey.

669
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:14,329
Get some rest, Max.

670
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:19,601
- There he is.
- Mom?

671
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:24,089
Hi. Justin, come on in. Come on in, now.

672
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:27,044
Look at you.

673
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,642
Justin, what have you done?

674
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:33,607
Done?

675
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:37,088
Tell the truth, Justin.
Don't you dare lie.

676
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,409
Ma'am, if I may...

677
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,682
Now, I was just having
a few off-duty beers...

678
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:43,450
with my buddy Tyler here when...

679
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:45,165
Wham!

680
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,330
My dog didn't know what hit him.

681
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:49,887
Got me pretty good too.

682
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:51,327
Now, that's assault.

683
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,522
I mean, I'm willing
to drop all charges...

684
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:56,843
if you go ahead
and put him down yourselves.

685
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:58,849
Truth is, he'll be put down regardless.

686
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:03,284
Max wasn't anywhere near you
or your dog. Mom, I mean...

687
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:06,845
Found this out near my place.

688
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:12,767
It's your bike, ain't it? Hmm?

689
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,007
Well...

690
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,164
Ms. Wincott.

691
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:26,002
How about me and you have
a few words in private, hmm? Man to man?

692
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:44,444
You know what this is?

693
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:48,089
It's a Beretta M9.
Built-in laser sight, the works.

694
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:52,285
Do you know how much it's worth?
About $600 here at the mall.

695
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:56,605
Now guess what it's worth over the border.
A shade over three grand.

696
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:02,690
You see, Kyle wouldn't give Emilio
the time of day...

697
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:06,168
but I do business with him
and so do you.

698
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,530
That's right. We found out
about your deal on our last leave.

699
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:13,611
Kyle was gonna tell your dad too,
but I talked him out of it.

700
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:16,764
Hey, that's word of honor.

701
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:19,287
We're more alike
than you and your brother were.

702
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:21,721
Why don't you just leave Max out of it?

703
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:25,003
If it were up to me, believe me, I would.
But Stack's steaming mad.

704
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:26,804
I ain't getting downwind of it.

705
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,764
And, hey, you shouldn't either.

706
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,128
That's a bad man down there.

707
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:38,762
And them cartel dudes we're
in business with are even worse.

708
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:42,487
Do you want a front row seat
at a couple more family funerals?

709
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:44,729
That's right.
Stack knows where you live.

710
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:48,845
Things go wrong, you think he'll be shy
about telling those guys who's responsible?

711
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:55,330
Your mom and dad
are family to me, Justin.

712
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:59,008
So do us all a favor
and keep your mouth shut.

713
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:05,644
Did Kyle know about your business?

714
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:10,328
My business.

715
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:23,890
I'm just a small fish in a big pond.

716
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:27,450
Okay? The big fish sell weapons
all over the world...

717
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:29,768
and then send wide-eyed hicks like me...

718
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,686
and your brother over there
so we can get shot and killed by them...

719
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:36,764
so they can cry their crocodile tears,
salute the flag...

720
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,968
and then sell some more.

721
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:54,810
Kyle always wanted to be a hero.

722
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,364
Look where it got him.

723
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:02,529
Now, you see, me, I'm a realist.

724
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:04,688
I know the way the world turns.

725
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:10,087
Which one are you gonna be?

726
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:24,370
Come on. Come on.

727
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:28,922
Max, hey. You don't deserve this, okay?

728
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:30,963
I know. I just...

729
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,328
I don't have a choice.

730
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:57,007
Thanks, Ray, I'll see you later.

731
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:12,041
Sorry I'm late.

732
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:14,686
It's all right. Pam called.

733
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:18,566
I just thought I'd hang out
a little bit longer, kind of cool down.

734
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:23,285
- Can't say as you didn't warn me.
- Yeah.

735
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,491
Hey, did you rent out 17-B?

736
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:27,761
Seventeen-B.

737
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:30,804
Yeah, there's a lock on the door
and I don't have an invoice.

738
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,321
That's mine.
I mean, it's a friend of mine's.

739
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,682
I'm letting him keep his stuff there
for a couple days.

740
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:38,929
- I should have asked.
- That's all right. We're all friends here.

741
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:40,929
He can keep his stuff in there.

742
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:44,488
Just come in, fill out the paperwork
and pay what's due.

743
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:46,850
Hey, Mr. Wincott. Ray.

744
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:52,725
Every kid gets in a spot of trouble
now and again.

745
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:35,536
Hello, you've reached the Wincotts.
Please leave a message.

746
01:11:35,706 --> 01:11:38,850
We'll call you back as soon
as we can. Thank you.

747
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:41,611
Mr. Wincott, Mrs. Wincott,
this is Sergeant Reyes.

748
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,848
Please call me at your earliest...

749
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:47,761
Harne's service record is protected
by privacy laws, but I talked to some people.

750
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:49,644
- I wanna tell your folks about...
- No.

751
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,569
I'm talking about some bad business.

752
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:54,491
No one could prove Harne's involvement,
but he got busted...

753
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:58,401
If you talk to my dad, I'm gonna tell
your higher-ups about that training disc.

754
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:00,011
Justin, are you all right?

755
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:02,441
I'll say you gave me
more classified stuff I threw away...

756
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:04,847
because I was afraid
of getting in trouble.

757
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,520
Okay? I'll swear it.
Don't ever call here again.

758
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:11,249
Come on, boy.

759
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,531
Easy, easy!

760
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:22,367
Come on, come on!

761
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:26,767
Get him in there!

762
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:28,690
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

763
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:36,407
Whoa, whoa. Watch out!

764
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:48,486
Whoa!

765
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,847
What's on your mind, Ray?

766
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:21,086
Something just isn't sitting right.

767
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:25,129
That deputy's place is way out there
in the middle of nowhere.

768
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:27,721
What would Justin and Max
be doing out there, Pam?

769
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:31,169
I don't know, Ray.
I told you, he wouldn't talk to me.

770
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,607
If you wanna know
what's going on with Justin...

771
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:37,207
I think it's time you ask him yourself.

772
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:41,726
I've been keeping the peace between you two
since the day Kyle left this house.

773
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:46,204
We already lost one son, Ray.

774
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:51,370
If it's all right with you,
I'd like to hold on to the other.

775
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:59,608
Justin.

776
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:03,930
Is there anything you wanna tell me
about what happened today?

777
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:11,047
- I'm sorry.
- That's not what I meant.

778
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:15,365
I've seen you start trouble before...

779
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:18,404
but I've never seen you do anything
other than own up to it.

780
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:23,441
I don't know, Dad,
I guess I'm just not a hero...

781
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:25,250
like you and Kyle.

782
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:28,848
Just the way the world turns.

783
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:51,361
In '91, my unit got deployed
to Saudi Arabia.

784
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:54,643
I'd just made sergeant.
It was my first command.

785
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,769
I was excited.

786
01:14:57,720 --> 01:15:00,803
That first night, we went into Kuwait.

787
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:05,210
We were about an hour in and we started
taking fire from our right flank.

788
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:08,805
The guy next to me got hit
and he went down.

789
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,686
I went to help him and I got hit. Twice.

790
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:17,442
One through the muscle
and one shattered the bone.

791
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:23,565
Turned out it was our own guys.
Friendly fire.

792
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:27,970
I got medevac'd to Germany
and the war was over so fast...

793
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:30,527
most of the guys got home before I did.

794
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:33,963
I got back,
there were some crazy stories.

795
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:39,002
At first, I tried
to straighten people out...

796
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:44,807
but they just looked so disappointed.

797
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,971
They didn't want to hear the truth.

798
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:51,484
They wanted a hero.

799
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:55,767
And so I stopped correcting them
sooner than I'd like to admit.

800
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:01,410
I wanted to tell Kyle.

801
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:06,885
I wanted him to know the truth.

802
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:10,601
The way that he looked at me.

803
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,450
The way that he looked up to me.

804
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,082
I just couldn't do it.

805
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:20,089
A hero always tells the truth...

806
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:25,002
no matter what people think about him
or what the consequences are.

807
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,404
And you've always been that way.

808
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:33,084
So if there's anything different
that happened today...

809
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:35,487
from what Tyler and that deputy
are saying...

810
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:38,770
I need you to tell me about it, son.

811
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:45,530
Dad...

812
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:50,007
I think I'm gonna go to sleep now.

813
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,130
Ray?

814
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:17,684
Now, you said this was a safe place
for us to store the merch.

815
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:20,565
It was, okay, but Wincott
started getting nosy.

816
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:22,808
Look, the ridge
is an isolated enough spot...

817
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,571
to keep us under the radar
till the pickup tomorrow night.

818
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:36,489
Tyler, I wanna talk to you.

819
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:38,966
What's going on here?

820
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:42,448
We're just moving my friend's stuff out,
like you said.

821
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:44,324
Deputy.

822
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:48,002
You two seem to be spending
a lot of time together lately.

823
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:51,928
Is this the beast that Max
supposedly chewed up today?

824
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:53,690
That was his brother.

825
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:56,008
He got bit so bad,
I had to put him down.

826
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:58,521
- You put him down?
- That's right.

827
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:00,688
Not Max.

828
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:05,050
What do you got in those crates?

829
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:08,124
You know, just odds and ends.
Nothing to concern yourself with.

830
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:11,403
Now, this is my property
so it is my concern. Which means...

831
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:14,251
Which means you should have stayed home.

832
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:21,481
You know, Ray, I'd like to know
what's going on. Yeah.

833
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:26,049
Justin! Justin! Hurry, please.

834
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:29,130
What did you and your father talk about?

835
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:31,926
- Nothing.
- After you talked about nothing, he left...

836
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:35,408
without a word and he just called
to say he was spending the night...

837
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:38,564
at our hunting cabin and not to worry.

838
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,091
We have a hunting cabin?

839
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:43,329
No, we do not have a hunting cabin.

840
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:50,804
Max.

841
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:52,731
Max.

842
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:55,561
Hey. Hey.

843
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:57,524
How'd you get home, buddy?

844
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:03,885
I'll be damned.

845
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:15,762
Come on, boy, let's go.

846
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:18,088
Oh, honey, I feel like
I should go in with you.

847
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:21,250
If you come, they won't
tell me anything. I'll be right back.

848
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:25,767
Yo, I told you she was hairy, B.

849
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:29,282
- What are you doing here waking my family up?
- Chuy, keep it down...

850
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:31,847
or I'm gonna come out there
and shut you up.

851
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:33,610
Come on, let's talk outside.

852
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:35,450
Okay, what's up?

853
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:37,920
Hey, guys, what's going on?

854
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:39,844
So my dad's MIA right now.

855
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:42,242
He left a really weird message
and disappeared.

856
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:43,885
- You call the cops?
- My mom did.

857
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:47,004
They won't do jack until he's gone
a lot longer than two hours.

858
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,931
- I told her you knew something about it.
- So you lied on us.

859
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:51,849
No, it's on me, Carmen, okay?

860
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:55,408
I just came because I need a bike
and a five minute head start.

861
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:58,405
All right. So then let's do this.

862
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:00,529
Carmen, this doesn't involve you, okay?

863
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:04,725
Are you gonna waste time on an argument
you'll lose or are you gonna get on that bike?

864
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:11,684
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold there. You can't have my bike, B.

865
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:13,564
Because I'm gonna be riding it.

866
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:16,331
Yo, Third Wheel,
you expecting Justin to walk?

867
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:22,963
This is my big brother's
prize ride, man.

868
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:25,049
You mess this sucker up, I'm toast.

869
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:26,321
Thanks, man.

870
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:29,330
All right, let's take the back way.
Just try and keep up.

871
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:57,087
All right. We ditch his ride here.

872
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:59,886
- From here on out, we go off-road.
- What about him?

873
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:01,645
Uh...

874
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:05,525
I had it handled, Emilio.

875
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,642
Now he's a hostage
until we make the exchange.

876
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:11,611
Once we do, you're gonna
take him over the border...

877
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:14,002
and see that he's never
heard from again.

878
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:16,965
- Do you got it?
- Got it.

879
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:21,886
No, I don't think so.
You ride in the doghouse.

880
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:35,562
- What's in there?
- I don't know.

881
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:41,891
Did you find something, boy?

882
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:45,283
Hey, I found this on the floor.

883
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:47,449
What is that?

884
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:49,450
It's my dad's holster. Max.

885
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,569
Go search.

886
01:21:57,920 --> 01:21:59,410
Man, that dog is fast, yo.

887
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:02,041
Then pedal faster, Third Wheel.

888
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:07,691
Oh, my God.

889
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:09,847
What's going on here?

890
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:11,451
- Ms. Wincott?
- Yes.

891
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:14,484
Your dog escaped from the pound.
Any chance he came back here?

892
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:15,806
My dog?

893
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:19,329
I reported my husband missing...

894
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:22,842
and I was told he's not
officially missing for 48 hours.

895
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:24,286
We are aware of that call.

896
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:27,848
But my dog's gone and you're gonna
tear up the town trying to find him?

897
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:30,285
That's the law.

898
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:37,082
I must have been crazy
to let you take Max from our house.

899
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:40,523
Max is with my son and his friends,
God knows where.

900
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:44,401
Why don't you go try to find them
and bring them home safely?

901
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:46,961
Max is part of our family now...

902
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:50,482
and if you so much as harm
one hair on his head...

903
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:55,242
I will see to it that you
and your entire department regret it.

904
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:57,929
That's my law.

905
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:13,689
Oh, man.

906
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:18,323
Hey, Dad?

907
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:23,882
Hey, Dad?

908
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:38,046
You having second thoughts?

909
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:41,045
My second thoughts
are having second thoughts.

910
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:00,081
What about the kid?

911
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:03,489
Sooner or later, he's gonna
put two and two together.

912
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:05,688
How far we planning on taking this?

913
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:09,089
When a Marine hits the beach,
he never stops and he never looks back.

914
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:16,807
You're not a Marine.

915
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:56,884
Oh, man, he's not gonna do
what I think he's gonna do.

916
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,731
Why you looking at me? I'm with the dog.

917
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:22,244
Whoa. This water's cold, B.

918
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:32,644
Hope you guys know how to swim
if it gets deep.

919
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:34,763
I can swim.

920
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:37,722
When'd you ever swim?

921
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:39,884
It's just something you know, man.

922
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:52,490
Careful, yo, it's getting deep here.

923
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:55,202
If Max can do it, then we can...

924
01:25:56,240 --> 01:25:57,287
Justin.

925
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:08,730
- Your brother's bike.
- Don't worry about it, I got it.

926
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:10,604
I got it.

927
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:31,644
I'm okay, Max, I'm okay.

928
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:37,330
Thank you.

929
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:41,640
Yeah. Just don't expect me to lick
your face and we're good.

930
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:45,966
Looks like you found the sweet spot.

931
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:48,642
We are not going back for Chuy's bike.

932
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:55,562
This was a bad idea.

933
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:56,887
You think?

934
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:08,291
Let's go see
what's at the top of that rise.

935
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:40,241
Emilio. Hey.

936
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:43,802
What's going on?
Yeah, hold on a second. Yeah, what's up?

937
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:47,483
Hey, hey, hey. Shh, shh, shh. Be quiet.

938
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:49,569
That sounds good. Sounds good.

939
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:51,410
We're good to go.

940
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:56,170
Hey. My dad's in the truck
with a couple of bad guys.

941
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:59,170
There's a highway over there
and Emilio's down there too.

942
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:02,648
We need to get to that highway,
get someone to call a cop or something.

943
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,370
How about a bunch of Navy SEALs?

944
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:06,642
I'm not gonna leave here
without my dad, okay?

945
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:09,486
I'm gonna stay here with Chuy,
you go get help, okay?

946
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:17,405
I am not seeing this.

947
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:29,887
Yo, we're cool,
but we don't talk about this. Never.

948
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:37,247
What?

949
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:39,568
Hello? Yeah, Mom, what?

950
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:51,044
Looks like Emilio's compadres
came out early to set an ambush.

951
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:52,287
This guy.

952
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:55,689
My compadres are coming from Mexico,
which is in that direction.

953
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:58,008
And they ain't planning
on jacking no one.

954
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:01,328
Only one way to find out.

955
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:03,371
Draco! Get them!

956
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:14,687
Whoa, whoa, man, what's that?

957
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:23,490
You gotta be kidding me.
Come on, let's finish this. On me.

958
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:25,648
I ain't leaving this guy
to watch the merch.

959
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:28,167
Fine, you stay here. I'll go.

960
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:31,682
Come on, Stack, it's just a kid
and his dog out there. Let's go.

961
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:34,605
Justin. Justin!

962
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:39,566
Ready for Round 2?

963
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:58,927
Fight smart, Max!

964
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:05,010
He's got something. Come on.

965
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:03,881
Hey, did you hear that? That's Max.

966
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:30,050
Come on, hurry up.

967
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:33,881
The dogs, through the trees, look.
There they are. Come on, come on, come on.

968
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:35,650
Yo.

969
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:51,848
I'm gonna go get a clear shot.

970
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:16,487
Tyler!

971
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:21,442
Emilio! He's coming your way!

972
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:34,207
Chuy!

973
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:39,123
What are you doing here?

974
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:42,531
Who are you here with, huh?
Who are you here with?

975
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:45,007
No one, primo.
Got lost here by myself, B.

976
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:48,130
Don't lie to me.
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

977
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:50,607
- Who are you here with?
- Whoa.

978
01:32:56,440 --> 01:32:58,249
Ugh! Aah!

979
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:06,530
Aah!

980
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:17,526
Justin! Justin!

981
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:23,681
- Emilio!
- Get down.

982
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:29,361
- Emilio!
- I broke my leg!

983
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:46,485
Max.

984
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:50,805
Max.

985
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:53,641
Max!

986
01:33:57,400 --> 01:33:58,970
Aah!

987
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:11,367
Max.

988
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:21,881
Justin.

989
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:23,650
- Oh, son.
- You okay?

990
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:25,881
Thank God.

991
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:28,164
Oh.

992
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:31,562
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

993
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:34,650
- Did you bring anybody with you?
- Besides Max, Carmen and Chuy.

994
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:37,283
- Are they okay?
- Yeah, yeah, they're fine.

995
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:40,205
Tyler's right behind me.
He's coming up fast. We need to go.

996
01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:42,807
- We gotta get to the highway.
- Let's take this truck.

997
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:47,528
No, Tyler took the keys.
But we can slow him down.

998
01:34:58,400 --> 01:34:59,606
Let's go.

999
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:08,405
- Where's Ray?
- Get in the truck.

1000
01:35:09,080 --> 01:35:10,127
What happened?

1001
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:12,163
Give me the keys and get in the truck!

1002
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:25,561
Justin. Wait.

1003
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:30,888
Justin, I'm just slowing
you and Max down.

1004
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:35,524
So much for taking that truck out.

1005
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:37,802
You and Max just go on to the highway...

1006
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:40,486
and I'll keep these guys
off you as long as I can.

1007
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:43,043
Every time I've been in trouble...

1008
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:45,447
Max has taken the fight away
to keep me safe.

1009
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:48,166
Wouldn't be right if I didn't
do the same for my dad.

1010
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:51,443
Justin! Justin!

1011
01:35:56,720 --> 01:35:59,690
Come on, come on, come on. There he is!

1012
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:23,882
Stop the truck. Stop the truck!

1013
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,161
You go after Ray.

1014
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:03,211
Come on, Max!

1015
01:37:11,640 --> 01:37:13,210
Hey.

1016
01:37:14,680 --> 01:37:16,364
Max!

1017
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:43,320
Whoa!

1018
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:46,490
Aah!

1019
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:05,405
Whoa.

1020
01:39:12,160 --> 01:39:13,650
Tyler!

1021
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:18,767
Tyler!

1022
01:39:19,640 --> 01:39:21,210
Don't you hurt my boy!

1023
01:39:22,680 --> 01:39:24,523
This never had to happen.

1024
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:26,686
None of it!

1025
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:30,764
What am I supposed
to do with you now, huh?

1026
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:32,769
What am I supposed to do with you now?!

1027
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:16,601
- Justin.
- You can't go down there, I'm sorry.

1028
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:18,643
That's my friend, though.

1029
01:40:53,480 --> 01:40:55,608
Hey, Kyle.

1030
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:02,961
I know that we didn't...

1031
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:06,522
We didn't really get along too well.

1032
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:11,203
We fought a lot.

1033
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:14,320
But I guess a lot of brothers
do that at the start.

1034
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:21,208
I'm sorry that we won't...

1035
01:41:22,200 --> 01:41:25,409
Won't get a chance
to really grow old together...

1036
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,082
become friends.

1037
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:34,885
Yep.

1038
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:45,521
I just wanted to thank you for Max.

1039
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:50,404
And tell you...

1040
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:54,803
I love you.

1041
01:41:58,200 --> 01:42:01,409
As long as I live,
I'm never gonna forget you.

1042
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,047
Okay.

1043
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:28,050
Come on.

1044
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:40,610
Yeah, Max.

1045
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:44,561
Looks like we got some carnitas
cooking in the house tonight.

1046
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:46,530
Gonna do this every time I come in?

1047
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:49,650
When you're an hour late,
you bet I will. Where have you been?

1048
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:52,207
Out cleaning up Gotham,
taking out villains, yo.

1049
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:55,404
He's gotta be a superhero
if he's gonna be my boyfriend.

1050
01:42:55,640 --> 01:42:59,167
Yeah. Gotta be a blind superhero
like Daredevil, right?

1051
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:02,131
- Dude, shut up! And stay.
- Whoa.

1052
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:07,403
Chuy, I'm glad you came.
I know your family must be upset about...

1053
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:10,285
Emilio should be in jail, bro.
It's the right thing.

1054
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:14,690
He was bad news for my family too.
That's between us.

1055
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:17,690
Hey, Max. How you doing, buddy?
Good to see you.

1056
01:43:18,160 --> 01:43:19,605
Hey, Mr. Wincott.

1057
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:21,325
I've got all my guys at home.

1058
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:23,284
- Hey, honey.
- Hey, sweetheart.

1059
01:43:23,640 --> 01:43:25,961
Dad, where's Max's cage?

1060
01:43:26,160 --> 01:43:28,766
I hauled it off to the scrapyard.

1061
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:32,203
I thought it was time for Max
to be inside with us from now on.

1062
01:43:34,280 --> 01:43:35,770
What do you say to your father?

1063
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:38,445
It's about time.

1064
01:43:38,640 --> 01:43:43,521
Yo, that's cold, B. Man, that's nastier
than Carmen's cooking, man.

1065
01:43:43,720 --> 01:43:47,805
- What?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, dog.

1066
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,924
She hit me, two times.
Why are you always taking her side?

1067
01:43:56,640 --> 01:43:59,962
Take it easy on him, Max.
He's a friendly.

1067
01:44:00,305 --> 01:45:00,816
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
