00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:33,311
Yes, this battle of the
Pokemon league finals is

3
00:00:33,353 --> 00:00:35,146
really picking up steam!

4
00:00:39,818 --> 00:00:40,985
Gengar dodges it!

5
00:00:47,784 --> 00:00:48,951
It's night shade!

6
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,955
But Blastoise withstands it!

7
00:00:53,123 --> 00:00:54,916
Wait! That was an ice beam!

8
00:00:56,585 --> 00:01:00,046
And gengar is frozen!
What will the trainer do now?

9
00:01:06,887 --> 00:01:08,972
There goes the poke ball...

10
00:01:09,973 --> 00:01:13,393
And the next Pokémon up is...
Venusaur!

11
00:01:14,144 --> 00:01:15,478
It's a razor leaf!

12
00:01:20,942 --> 00:01:23,986
But Blastoise's hydro pump
scores a direct hit!

13
00:01:32,746 --> 00:01:36,249
Wow! Venusaur's solar beam,
and Blastoise's hydro pump...

14
00:01:36,374 --> 00:01:38,000
What power!

15
00:01:38,126 --> 00:01:39,752
Man! Oh, wow! Yes!
Yeah! Get 'em!

16
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,422
This is Ash Ketchum,
from pallet town.

17
00:01:42,506 --> 00:01:44,424
Ash is almost ten years old.

18
00:01:44,466 --> 00:01:48,261
When youngsters with aspirations
to become Pokémon trainers turn ten,

19
00:01:48,303 --> 00:01:51,639
they can choose their first
Pokemon from professor oak.

20
00:01:51,765 --> 00:01:53,808
They can choose
from Bulbasaur...

21
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,353
Charmander... And Squirtle.
Then, they can begin

22
00:01:57,521 --> 00:02:00,023
their exciting journeys
as Pokemon trainers!

23
00:02:06,655 --> 00:02:09,824
Bulbasaur... charmander...

24
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:14,450
Squirtle... Here we go.

25
00:02:16,373 --> 00:02:19,376
All right, I choose you!

26
00:02:31,513 --> 00:02:33,681
Ash ketchum,
are you still asleep?

27
00:02:33,807 --> 00:02:36,434
You'll be late getting
to professor oak's lab!

28
00:02:36,518 --> 00:02:39,479
Yeah, right,
professor oak's lab...

29
00:02:43,108 --> 00:02:45,360
Mom, why didn't you wake me up?!

30
00:02:45,986 --> 00:02:48,195
You said yourself
when you turned ten,

31
00:02:48,196 --> 00:02:49,864
you could wake up on your own!

32
00:03:03,795 --> 00:03:05,296
Hey professor oak!
I made it. I'm here!

33
00:03:05,463 --> 00:03:06,797
Oh. Hello, ash.

34
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,426
So, professor oak,
where's my Pokémon?!

35
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,179
Ah, so you're the last of
the four young ones

36
00:03:13,221 --> 00:03:14,931
starting out
on their journeys today.

37
00:03:16,558 --> 00:03:19,852
I've thought about it a lot and
it took me a really long time,

38
00:03:19,895 --> 00:03:22,397
but I finally decided.
I'm gonna choose squirtle!

39
00:03:22,856 --> 00:03:26,442
I'm afraid squirtle was chosen
by a trainer who wasn't late.

40
00:03:28,612 --> 00:03:31,948
I've got no one
to blame but myself.

41
00:03:32,073 --> 00:03:34,116
Okay, then
I'll choose Bulbasaur!

42
00:03:34,326 --> 00:03:37,620
Bulbasaur went with a trainer
who also got here on time.

43
00:03:40,582 --> 00:03:43,751
All right! I mean
I really want charmander!

44
00:03:44,002 --> 00:03:46,504
Being a second late for
a train, or even a Pokemon,

45
00:03:46,588 --> 00:03:48,047
can be life changing.

46
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,640
Does that mean... I go on
my journey without a Pokémon?

47
00:03:57,849 --> 00:03:59,892
Well, there is another, but...

48
00:03:59,935 --> 00:04:01,269
Uh, I'll take it!

49
00:04:01,603 --> 00:04:04,147
I think I should warn you
that there is a problem

50
00:04:04,231 --> 00:04:05,315
with this last one...

51
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,068
So what? Since I was late, then
I've got a problem with me, too!

52
00:04:09,236 --> 00:04:10,320
All right...

53
00:04:12,447 --> 00:04:16,075
Awesome! All right then,
you're my Pokemon!

54
00:04:17,619 --> 00:04:18,745
Whoa!

55
00:04:34,052 --> 00:04:36,471
This Pokémon is called Pikachu.

56
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:39,849
It's so cute!
Looks like I got the best one!

57
00:04:39,975 --> 00:04:40,850
You'll see...

58
00:04:40,976 --> 00:04:43,895
Oh, yeah! Hi, Pikachu,
my name's Ash Ketchum!

59
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,147
You and I are gonna
be best friends!

60
00:04:51,152 --> 00:04:53,279
It's the electric mouse Pokemon.

61
00:04:53,405 --> 00:04:55,532
Pikachu can be rather shy,

62
00:04:55,615 --> 00:04:58,326
but quite electrifying
when touched by humans.

63
00:05:00,662 --> 00:05:02,372
Hey, I can take a little zap!

64
00:05:02,831 --> 00:05:03,873
All right then.

65
00:05:04,082 --> 00:05:07,293
If that's how you feel, then
this is Pikachu's poke ball.

66
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,963
Thanks a lot, professor!

67
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,381
Ash?

68
00:05:12,007 --> 00:05:14,676
Remember, you were going to
head out on your journey

69
00:05:14,718 --> 00:05:17,178
right after getting your Pokémon.
For goodness sake!

70
00:05:23,643 --> 00:05:26,228
Here. I packed shirts,
underwear, a towel,

71
00:05:26,313 --> 00:05:28,231
your toothbrush,
and a sleeping bag.

72
00:05:28,606 --> 00:05:30,274
Let's go, Pikachu!

73
00:05:31,985 --> 00:05:34,904
Don't Pokémon usually
go in their poké balls?

74
00:05:35,447 --> 00:05:38,491
They sure do!
Come on, Pikachu, get in!

75
00:05:41,369 --> 00:05:43,245
Get in your poké ball!

76
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:47,708
Oh, right.

77
00:05:47,834 --> 00:05:50,920
This Pikachu hates getting
into any sort of poké ball.

78
00:05:50,962 --> 00:05:52,713
Whoa, it does?

79
00:05:53,715 --> 00:05:55,091
Now get in!

80
00:06:04,059 --> 00:06:05,727
Wow! If you're playing catch,

81
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,728
then you're good friends already!

82
00:06:07,812 --> 00:06:12,024
Yeah, you're right!
We're best friends already, right?

83
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,583
Pikachu? Are you gonna be
like this the whole way?

84
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:34,255
Is it because you don't like me?

85
00:06:35,548 --> 00:06:37,466
Well, I like you a lot!

86
00:06:39,135 --> 00:06:41,303
And no matter what,
I want to be your friend.

87
00:06:41,388 --> 00:06:43,640
So we're all done with this.

88
00:06:46,017 --> 00:06:47,143
Now. Put 'er there

89
00:06:50,188 --> 00:06:51,981
you're a handful.

90
00:06:54,818 --> 00:06:57,821
Hey, a Pidgey!
That's awesome! Yes!

91
00:06:59,072 --> 00:07:01,115
Catching that Pidgey's gonna
be my first step

92
00:07:01,157 --> 00:07:02,992
toward becoming
a Pokémon master!

93
00:07:03,034 --> 00:07:04,493
Go, poké ball!

94
00:07:08,123 --> 00:07:08,873
I caught it!

95
00:07:16,798 --> 00:07:20,760
The way to catch 'em is
have a battle. Go, Pikachu!

96
00:07:21,469 --> 00:07:23,345
Aw, come on,
aren't you gonna help me out?

97
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,349
Fine then. I'll do it myself.

98
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:35,525
It's a Spearow!

99
00:08:03,386 --> 00:08:05,054
Let's get out of here, quick!

100
00:08:18,234 --> 00:08:19,151
Knock it off!

101
00:08:19,235 --> 00:08:22,321
I'm the one who threw the rock!
You should be attacking me!

102
00:08:53,394 --> 00:08:55,270
Are you all right, Pikachu?

103
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:09,827
Pikachu! You're gonna be just fine!
Hang in there!

104
00:09:29,347 --> 00:09:30,639
Pikachu!

105
00:09:34,602 --> 00:09:36,061
No, Pikachu.

106
00:09:37,188 --> 00:09:38,814
This can't be happening, right?

107
00:09:48,283 --> 00:09:50,660
Pikachu! You've gotta go inside!

108
00:09:52,328 --> 00:09:55,414
I know you can't stand going inside
your poké ball, but still...

109
00:09:55,665 --> 00:09:57,667
In there, you'll be protected!

110
00:09:57,792 --> 00:10:00,336
So come on...
Get inside, please?

111
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:04,006
Then leave the rest to me.
I'll take care of this!

112
00:10:09,512 --> 00:10:10,721
All right, you!

113
00:10:10,847 --> 00:10:13,057
I don't think you know who
you're dealing with!

114
00:10:13,141 --> 00:10:15,143
But I'm Ash Ketchum,
from pallet town!

115
00:10:15,393 --> 00:10:18,521
And I'm gonna be
the world's greatest Pokemon master!

116
00:10:18,646 --> 00:10:20,773
Mess with me and
you're gonna lose!

117
00:10:20,857 --> 00:10:23,317
I'm gonna catch all of
you Pokémon at once!

118
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:29,031
Pikachu, you've gotta get
inside your poké ball now!

119
00:10:29,449 --> 00:10:31,742
All right, you,
hit me with your best shot!

120
00:11:18,706 --> 00:11:19,832
Pikachu...

121
00:11:27,465 --> 00:11:28,674
You'll stay?

122
00:11:29,425 --> 00:11:30,342
Mean it?

123
00:11:56,202 --> 00:11:57,453
What's that?

124
00:12:37,285 --> 00:12:40,579
Pikachu? Someday we'll both
meet that Pokemon!

125
00:15:18,237 --> 00:15:20,489
Pikachu, use quick attack!

126
00:15:21,657 --> 00:15:23,450
Tangela, vine whip!

127
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:36,505
Tangela is unable to battle!

128
00:15:36,756 --> 00:15:39,425
Thus, the winner is
ash from pallet town!

129
00:15:39,508 --> 00:15:41,426
All right!

130
00:15:42,595 --> 00:15:44,179
Man, you were awesome, Pikachu!

131
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:49,434
Very well. As proof of your victory
at the Celadon gym,

132
00:15:49,644 --> 00:15:52,313
and by the authority of
the Pokemon league,

133
00:15:52,355 --> 00:15:54,857
I now present you with
the rainbow badge.

134
00:15:55,608 --> 00:15:57,526
I just got a rainbow badge!

135
00:15:59,195 --> 00:16:00,863
How many badges does this make?

136
00:16:00,988 --> 00:16:02,364
It's my third one!

137
00:16:02,865 --> 00:16:04,867
I look forward to you
winning all eight

138
00:16:04,951 --> 00:16:06,744
and entering the Pokemon league!

139
00:16:06,827 --> 00:16:08,537
Thanks! I'll do my best!

140
00:16:19,674 --> 00:16:20,716
Oh, hi, mom.

141
00:16:21,175 --> 00:16:24,052
Well, well!
You finally decided to call!

142
00:16:24,178 --> 00:16:25,554
Uh, yeah.

143
00:16:26,347 --> 00:16:29,391
Do you have any idea how many
Pokémon centers

144
00:16:29,475 --> 00:16:31,977
I've been leaving messages at
hoping you would be there?!

145
00:16:32,103 --> 00:16:33,813
So what's this big emergency?

146
00:16:34,313 --> 00:16:36,690
If I didn't say it
was a big emergency,

147
00:16:36,732 --> 00:16:38,734
you wouldn't have called back,
would you?!

148
00:16:38,776 --> 00:16:40,068
You're just like your father!

149
00:16:40,152 --> 00:16:42,988
It wouldn't hurt to call me
once in a while, now would it?

150
00:16:43,656 --> 00:16:45,574
Oh! Pikachu! Hi there!

151
00:16:46,867 --> 00:16:48,994
That's all? I'm hanging up.

152
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,412
Now you just hold on!

153
00:16:50,496 --> 00:16:52,498
I want to make sure
you're eating right!

154
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,582
I'm eating...

155
00:16:53,624 --> 00:16:56,251
And eat your vegetables!
It's very important!

156
00:16:56,293 --> 00:16:57,752
And what about laundry?

157
00:16:57,795 --> 00:17:00,422
You're not wearing dirty
shirts every day, are you?

158
00:17:01,048 --> 00:17:02,841
Come on, mom!
You worry too much.

159
00:17:05,511 --> 00:17:08,430
You're all set.
Your Pokemon's completely healed.

160
00:17:08,514 --> 00:17:10,349
Happy and in perfect health.

161
00:17:10,391 --> 00:17:13,435
I was so worried!
Thank you, nurse joy.

162
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,104
Wanted posters?

163
00:17:15,521 --> 00:17:17,481
Yes, that's team rocket.

164
00:17:18,733 --> 00:17:19,775
Team rocket?

165
00:17:20,234 --> 00:17:21,193
They're awful,

166
00:17:21,235 --> 00:17:23,695
and they go around stealing
other people's Pokemon.

167
00:17:23,738 --> 00:17:24,947
The worst of the worst.

168
00:17:25,072 --> 00:17:27,032
Really? I wonder what
that's all about...

169
00:17:27,241 --> 00:17:29,284
She's wondering what
we're all about.

170
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,662
Actions speak louder than words.

171
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,165
All we do is get our paws
on Primo Pokémon,

172
00:17:35,249 --> 00:17:38,293
and they'll know how
magnificently we rock!

173
00:17:40,755 --> 00:17:45,255
Excuse me! Nurse joy!
Please help my Pokemon!

174
00:17:45,676 --> 00:17:47,302
My Vaporeon's been hurt...

175
00:17:47,344 --> 00:17:50,263
Let me see.
It doesn't look good!

176
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:51,849
What happened?

177
00:17:51,974 --> 00:17:53,809
That Entei
came out of nowhere...

178
00:17:54,643 --> 00:17:56,561
En '7
tel. I'm sorry. Mom!

179
00:17:56,687 --> 00:17:57,771
Gotta go!
Ash! But...

180
00:17:58,606 --> 00:18:00,482
I thought for sure
we could catch it...

181
00:18:01,358 --> 00:18:03,902
Don't worry. It'll be just fine.

182
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:08,073
Thank you so much!

183
00:18:09,075 --> 00:18:10,326
Did you say Entei?

184
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:13,662
Yeah. One of
the legendary Pokemon.

185
00:18:14,163 --> 00:18:16,832
They're so rare,
nobody ever sees them!

186
00:18:16,957 --> 00:18:20,752
I tried to catch it, but it was
so overwhelmingly strong...

187
00:18:21,087 --> 00:18:22,755
We were beat in no time,

188
00:18:23,089 --> 00:18:25,841
and after, that it ran
into the forest.

189
00:18:26,425 --> 00:18:27,592
It's probably still close!

190
00:18:28,052 --> 00:18:29,136
I'm gonna catch it!

191
00:18:30,346 --> 00:18:32,056
Let's go, Pikachu!

192
00:18:33,891 --> 00:18:37,019
Some big deal!
And they're totally clueless.

193
00:18:40,523 --> 00:18:41,648
I know you!

194
00:18:41,649 --> 00:18:46,149
Entei's on the run!
Ain't we got fun?!

195
00:18:50,491 --> 00:18:51,700
Where are you, Entei?

196
00:19:01,836 --> 00:19:03,254
There it is!

197
00:19:11,554 --> 00:19:13,389
Let's go, Piplup!

198
00:19:17,393 --> 00:19:19,353
Hold it! I got here first!

199
00:19:19,478 --> 00:19:21,062
I got here first!

200
00:19:28,154 --> 00:19:30,072
Piplup, use bubble beam!

201
00:19:44,128 --> 00:19:45,879
Pikachu, use thunderbolt!

202
00:20:08,861 --> 00:20:10,821
Lucario, aura sphere!

203
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,209
Piplup, bubble beam!

204
00:20:41,435 --> 00:20:43,812
All right! You let it escape!

205
00:20:44,772 --> 00:20:47,399
I totally could've caught it
if you hadn't gotten in the way!

206
00:20:48,192 --> 00:20:49,693
You were in the way!

207
00:20:49,944 --> 00:20:51,152
No, you were!

208
00:20:51,153 --> 00:20:52,612
Wanna see if you can beat me?

209
00:20:52,696 --> 00:20:56,491
Good idea. I'm ash from pallet town!
Let's have a battle...

210
00:20:57,576 --> 00:21:01,121
And I accept! I'm verity
and I'm from Twinleaf town!

211
00:21:01,288 --> 00:21:05,250
Hey, dude! Once I Polish off this kid,
you're gonna be next!

212
00:21:05,626 --> 00:21:07,544
I want a battle with you, too!

213
00:21:08,462 --> 00:21:10,672
Hey! What do you mean,
Polish me off?!

214
00:21:11,298 --> 00:21:15,010
I'm sorrel from Veilstone city.
I'll take a pass on the battles.

215
00:21:15,261 --> 00:21:16,095
Running away?

216
00:21:16,136 --> 00:21:17,679
Come on! Let's have a battle!

217
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:19,598
Here's a little warning for you.

218
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:21,558
You're going to feel
the wind soon.

219
00:21:21,642 --> 00:21:23,560
I'd start looking for
shelter from the rain.

220
00:21:25,479 --> 00:21:26,688
It's gonna rain?

221
00:21:26,814 --> 00:21:30,108
Before you find shelter, I think
you'd better call your mommy!

222
00:21:30,526 --> 00:21:32,986
Hey! Quit it! Let's do this!

223
00:21:33,153 --> 00:21:34,529
Right with you!

224
00:21:35,155 --> 00:21:36,489
I'll give you the first move!

225
00:21:36,615 --> 00:21:38,366
Quit trying to be a gentleman.

226
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:40,076
You may wind up regretting it!

227
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,370
Now, Piplup, use drill peck!

228
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:45,916
All right, Pikachu,
use iron tail!

229
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,337
Now, quick attack!

230
00:21:55,551 --> 00:21:57,219
Piplup, are you okay?

231
00:21:58,387 --> 00:21:59,805
Then use hydro pump!

232
00:22:01,432 --> 00:22:02,599
Dodge it...

233
00:22:17,156 --> 00:22:18,198
My Piplup!

234
00:22:18,365 --> 00:22:19,491
Here! Let's move!

235
00:22:19,616 --> 00:22:20,408
Right...

236
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:30,293
Well, I'm here,
so where's Entei?

237
00:22:31,628 --> 00:22:32,587
What's that?

238
00:22:32,755 --> 00:22:34,423
Entei's coming to check us out!

239
00:22:40,346 --> 00:22:42,681
We're blasting off again!

240
00:23:01,617 --> 00:23:04,453
That rock!
Let's get on top of it!

241
00:23:16,715 --> 00:23:20,635
Onix! Stop it! You're only
gonna hurt yourself this way!

242
00:23:20,719 --> 00:23:23,471
Yelling at it is only
going to make it worse!

243
00:23:24,556 --> 00:23:25,306
All right!

244
00:23:32,648 --> 00:23:34,441
Ash! Be careful!

245
00:23:36,068 --> 00:23:37,110
Stop it!

246
00:23:38,278 --> 00:23:39,654
Use whirlpool!

247
00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:45,827
I'm sorry for scaring you, onix!

248
00:23:45,953 --> 00:23:48,121
I wish you'd just
calm down, please!

249
00:24:11,478 --> 00:24:13,480
Onix, I'm sorry!

250
00:24:15,441 --> 00:24:17,818
Piplup, your whirlpool
really saved the day!

251
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:21,696
Ash, thank you.
I've gotta tell you.

252
00:24:22,156 --> 00:24:24,992
You do some dumb things,
but I'm impressed.

253
00:24:25,492 --> 00:24:26,367
Forget it.

254
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:27,869
Rain!

255
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,204
Just like that kid said!

256
00:24:48,765 --> 00:24:49,807
A charmander!

257
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:51,935
It doesn't look
like it's very happy...

258
00:24:52,019 --> 00:24:54,271
Hey what are you doing out
in the rain like this?

259
00:25:06,408 --> 00:25:07,909
That must be its trainer.

260
00:25:16,043 --> 00:25:18,628
You're still here? Go away!

261
00:25:19,963 --> 00:25:21,798
Hey wait, are you its trainer?

262
00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:23,216
Who's asking?

263
00:25:24,092 --> 00:25:25,093
Answer the question!

264
00:25:25,469 --> 00:25:27,429
What're you worked up about?

265
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,806
Yeah. Originally I was.

266
00:25:29,932 --> 00:25:30,807
Originally?

267
00:25:30,891 --> 00:25:32,017
I ditched the weakling.

268
00:25:32,392 --> 00:25:34,936
There are charmander like
that one all over the place.

269
00:25:35,896 --> 00:25:40,275
But then, it just kept following me.
So I told it to wait here.

270
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:41,818
What an awful thing to say!

271
00:25:41,902 --> 00:25:42,861
Ash is right!

272
00:25:42,903 --> 00:25:45,238
When you've caught a Pokémon
and then you tell it to wait,

273
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,448
some of them will
actually wait forever!

274
00:25:48,158 --> 00:25:49,367
So what's the problem?

275
00:25:51,036 --> 00:25:52,287
Hold it!

276
00:25:58,877 --> 00:26:01,254
Only a Pokémon's
strength matters.

277
00:26:01,255 --> 00:26:03,924
If it's gonna survive,
it had better grow stronger!

278
00:26:04,341 --> 00:26:05,216
What?!

279
00:26:05,259 --> 00:26:08,637
Wait! Isn't it a trainer's job to help
their Pokemon grow strong?!

280
00:26:08,762 --> 00:26:11,514
Nah. And what do you get
for that work anyway?

281
00:26:13,267 --> 00:26:14,810
You get to become friends!

282
00:26:16,436 --> 00:26:17,478
You're too soft.

283
00:26:17,604 --> 00:26:20,481
The only thing friendship
does is make a Pokemon weak!

284
00:26:21,775 --> 00:26:23,109
My name's cross.

285
00:26:23,235 --> 00:26:25,570
I'm going to become
the greatest trainer ever.

286
00:26:26,238 --> 00:26:27,656
Hey! Hold it!

287
00:26:32,953 --> 00:26:33,995
Charmander!

288
00:26:34,121 --> 00:26:35,956
Its flame is getting weaker!

289
00:26:36,456 --> 00:26:38,499
And if Charmander's flame
goes out then...

290
00:26:41,086 --> 00:26:42,837
Ash, we've got to do something!

291
00:26:43,046 --> 00:26:43,921
Right!

292
00:27:10,907 --> 00:27:13,242
You left it out in the rain!
What were you thinking?!

293
00:27:13,327 --> 00:27:15,203
Calm down.
It isn't ash's fault!

294
00:27:15,329 --> 00:27:18,040
It was in the rain after
its trainer abandoned it!

295
00:27:18,373 --> 00:27:20,333
It would've stayed out
in the rain forever!

296
00:27:26,006 --> 00:27:27,048
Can you help?

297
00:27:27,132 --> 00:27:28,675
That's what I'm trying to do.

298
00:27:32,012 --> 00:27:33,888
No Pokémon with that
much loyalty is going

299
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,264
to go untreated!

300
00:27:43,732 --> 00:27:46,443
I know it's hard,
but please take this.

301
00:27:49,863 --> 00:27:51,406
That should stabilize you.

302
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:53,325
Now all we do is wait
for it to recover.

303
00:27:54,117 --> 00:27:55,576
Make sure it doesn't get cold.

304
00:27:56,995 --> 00:27:58,079
I'll warm it up!

305
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:03,876
Don't worry, charmander.
You'll be fine!

306
00:28:17,224 --> 00:28:19,017
How do you feel?
Are you still cold?

307
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,442
Things are looking a lot better.

308
00:28:28,235 --> 00:28:29,819
'Cuz of you. Thanks a lot!

309
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:32,780
You're like nurse joy
at the Pokemon center!

310
00:28:32,989 --> 00:28:35,074
I'm hoping to become
a Pokémon professor,

311
00:28:35,075 --> 00:28:36,701
and you need medical
training for that.

312
00:28:36,785 --> 00:28:37,702
Wow...

313
00:28:37,744 --> 00:28:40,163
Right now,
I'm traveling all over,

314
00:28:40,205 --> 00:28:42,123
gathering data
on legendary Pokemon.

315
00:28:42,833 --> 00:28:45,335
So it's good that you ran
into Entei, isn't it?

316
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:48,755
Of course. It was
a priceless experience.

317
00:28:49,381 --> 00:28:51,800
By the way, why did
you come here, verity?

318
00:28:51,925 --> 00:28:53,468
You're a long way from home.

319
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,220
Well... long story.
Hey, ash, why are you here?

320
00:28:59,808 --> 00:29:03,394
Who, me? I wanna be the world's
greatest Pokemon master!

321
00:29:03,603 --> 00:29:06,272
Master? Do you mean
the world's best trainer?

322
00:29:06,356 --> 00:29:08,524
Oh, no way!
Much more than that!

323
00:29:12,112 --> 00:29:13,321
It's so cold!

324
00:29:17,075 --> 00:29:18,076
Are you all right?

325
00:29:18,201 --> 00:29:20,077
Sure! That was nothing!

326
00:29:24,207 --> 00:29:25,416
Trying to warm me up?

327
00:29:29,421 --> 00:29:30,672
Thanks, Piplup...

328
00:29:31,339 --> 00:29:34,133
As a precaution, you're going back
in your poké ball.

329
00:29:34,134 --> 00:29:36,678
We shouldn't let the Pokemon
spend the night out in the cold.

330
00:29:37,471 --> 00:29:39,347
You're right. You, too, Piplup.

331
00:29:41,141 --> 00:29:43,268
You know...
I'd like to do that.

332
00:29:43,351 --> 00:29:46,354
But Pikachu really can't stand
getting into its poké ball.

333
00:29:46,438 --> 00:29:47,605
Right, buddy?

334
00:29:51,067 --> 00:29:52,985
No, you can't!
You'll catch a cold!

335
00:29:53,028 --> 00:29:54,446
It's for the best.

336
00:29:55,655 --> 00:29:56,447
Lucario...

337
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:57,866
Alright, Piplup...

338
00:30:36,571 --> 00:30:38,489
Seeing the fearsome
forces of nature...

339
00:30:38,615 --> 00:30:40,283
People and Pokemon are the same.

340
00:30:41,701 --> 00:30:42,660
Yeah...

341
00:30:44,037 --> 00:30:47,790
There's a legend, that proclaims
ho-oh gave life to Entei.

342
00:30:48,041 --> 00:30:49,042
You mean it?!

343
00:30:55,632 --> 00:30:57,842
You see, around
a hundred and fifty years ago,

344
00:30:57,884 --> 00:30:59,844
there was
a magnificent bell tower.

345
00:31:00,095 --> 00:31:02,639
And this bell tower
made it possible for humans

346
00:31:02,681 --> 00:31:04,933
to actually make
contact with ho-oh.

347
00:31:05,308 --> 00:31:09,020
But lightning struck the tower,
engulfing it in flames.

348
00:31:09,813 --> 00:31:12,190
Suddenly, a great rain came down,

349
00:31:12,232 --> 00:31:13,650
and the flames
were extinguished.

350
00:31:14,484 --> 00:31:17,903
But three nameless Pokemon
succumbed to the inferno.

351
00:31:17,904 --> 00:31:20,865
Amidst the destruction,
ho-oh descended and bestowed

352
00:31:20,907 --> 00:31:23,743
life upon them once again,
and they were revived.

353
00:31:24,077 --> 00:31:26,496
They represented
the lightning that struck,

354
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,290
the flame that engulfed,

355
00:31:28,415 --> 00:31:30,500
and the water that
extinguished the tower.

356
00:31:33,461 --> 00:31:36,213
Three natural forces made flesh.

357
00:31:39,342 --> 00:31:43,137
Raikou, Entei... And Suicune.

358
00:31:43,471 --> 00:31:45,097
Oh, I just love Suicune!

359
00:31:45,557 --> 00:31:48,810
And this, is the Pokémon who guards
over their existences...

360
00:31:49,603 --> 00:31:50,520
Ho-oh.

361
00:31:52,397 --> 00:31:53,147
You've seen it?

362
00:31:53,148 --> 00:31:55,150
The first day I started out
on my journey!

363
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:56,692
Are you serious?

364
00:31:56,735 --> 00:32:00,321
Yeah! And as soon as I did...
This came floating down!

365
00:32:01,031 --> 00:32:02,949
No way you got the rainbow wing!

366
00:32:04,701 --> 00:32:06,452
What's the rainbow wing?

367
00:32:07,037 --> 00:32:09,622
Few people have ever
even seen ho-oh,

368
00:32:09,664 --> 00:32:12,667
and on rare occasions,
ho-oh is said to bestow a feather

369
00:32:12,709 --> 00:32:14,669
on a human
it particularly likes.

370
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:18,339
Yeah? I guess that must
mean ho-oh likes me! Huh!

371
00:32:18,757 --> 00:32:20,884
But, why would ho-oh do that?

372
00:32:21,301 --> 00:32:23,011
There's a legend
that explains it.

373
00:32:23,386 --> 00:32:26,013
It says there is
a rainbow hero who is led

374
00:32:26,056 --> 00:32:28,391
by the rainbow wing
to seek out ho-oh.

375
00:32:30,393 --> 00:32:31,685
A rainbow hero?

376
00:32:31,853 --> 00:32:34,313
I don't know about any of this,
but it's cool...

377
00:32:34,481 --> 00:32:36,691
Oh. Impressed with yourself, huh?

378
00:32:38,026 --> 00:32:39,193
Oops!

379
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,645
Morning, Piplup. Sleep well?

380
00:33:18,233 --> 00:33:19,901
Entei and its friends are gone...

381
00:33:19,943 --> 00:33:20,860
Yeah.

382
00:33:23,738 --> 00:33:26,365
Hey! Charmander!
You feeling better?

383
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,460
Let's see.
Your tail flame looks good.

384
00:33:38,712 --> 00:33:39,379
Yup.

385
00:33:39,713 --> 00:33:42,424
That tells me
you are back to feeling fine!

386
00:33:42,507 --> 00:33:43,257
You're good to go.

387
00:33:43,341 --> 00:33:44,592
Isn't that great, charmander?

388
00:33:46,511 --> 00:33:47,428
Hey...

389
00:33:48,722 --> 00:33:49,848
You wanna come along with us?

390
00:33:51,141 --> 00:33:53,017
I'd like us to
become good friends!

391
00:34:01,568 --> 00:34:02,110
Please?

392
00:34:05,697 --> 00:34:08,199
Great! You really mean it?

393
00:34:12,412 --> 00:34:13,871
Okay, here it goes.

394
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,505
I just caught a charmander!

395
00:34:23,715 --> 00:34:26,592
Congratulations, ash.
You too, Pikachu.

396
00:34:34,768 --> 00:34:36,060
It's a rainbow!

397
00:34:36,561 --> 00:34:38,229
So beautiful!

398
00:34:38,521 --> 00:34:41,106
They say that ho-oh lives
at the end of the rainbow.

399
00:34:51,493 --> 00:34:55,330
The legend... Says the rainbow wing
will guide you.

400
00:34:58,291 --> 00:35:00,126
So, what's over that way?

401
00:35:01,961 --> 00:35:04,338
There are quite a number of
steep mountains over there.

402
00:35:04,964 --> 00:35:06,340
The Raizen mountain range.

403
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:11,554
I know!

404
00:35:11,805 --> 00:35:14,516
I'm gonna meet ho-oh
and have a Pokémon battle!

405
00:35:18,686 --> 00:35:20,688
I'd love to meet ho-oh, too!

406
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:21,730
So would I!

407
00:35:21,815 --> 00:35:23,399
Then I can determine for myself

408
00:35:23,483 --> 00:35:26,736
whether the legend of
the rainbow hero, is actually true.

409
00:35:26,945 --> 00:35:27,904
C'mon!

410
00:35:28,905 --> 00:35:31,532
We've gotta get moving
and find ho-oh!

411
00:35:32,033 --> 00:35:33,034
Right!

412
00:35:35,537 --> 00:35:36,788
That's music to my ears...

413
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,956
Entei proved too elusive, but...

414
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,541
Catching ho-oh would rule!

415
00:35:40,625 --> 00:35:42,585
We're so cool...

416
00:35:43,837 --> 00:35:44,879
Yee-haaa!

417
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,257
Hah!

418
00:35:58,601 --> 00:36:00,728
A bug type against a bug type!

419
00:36:00,812 --> 00:36:03,564
Yeah! Caterpie, I choose you!

420
00:36:08,736 --> 00:36:10,863
Caterpie, use string shot!

421
00:36:18,955 --> 00:36:20,081
All right!

422
00:36:22,041 --> 00:36:23,083
It's evolving...

423
00:36:26,546 --> 00:36:28,089
It turned into a metapod!

424
00:36:31,759 --> 00:36:33,218
Pinsir's getting away.

425
00:36:33,887 --> 00:36:36,264
That's okay!
This is what counts.

426
00:36:36,431 --> 00:36:38,433
Congratulations, metapod!

427
00:37:45,416 --> 00:37:46,792
Really? Suicune?!

428
00:37:47,085 --> 00:37:48,795
Standing right in front of me.

429
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,005
Man, I wish
I could've been there...

430
00:37:53,132 --> 00:37:54,508
Our eyes met...

431
00:37:54,634 --> 00:37:56,844
And it was like time stopped.

432
00:37:57,887 --> 00:37:59,805
Yeah. We were so connected.

433
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,016
Wow. Must've been nice!

434
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:06,687
To meet suicune so soon after
seeing entei. Incredible luck.

435
00:38:07,939 --> 00:38:09,482
I think so, too!

436
00:38:09,816 --> 00:38:12,026
I wonder how
my mom would feel about it.

437
00:38:13,486 --> 00:38:17,740
Oh. My mother... she's a famous
Pokemon trainer back home.

438
00:38:17,865 --> 00:38:20,367
Nothing I ever do
is good enough for her.

439
00:38:20,451 --> 00:38:23,662
If I'm honest, we haven't
talked since I left.

440
00:38:26,249 --> 00:38:27,375
You know what I think?

441
00:38:27,417 --> 00:38:28,793
I think she would
be proud of you.

442
00:38:28,876 --> 00:38:30,711
He's right!
'Course she would.

443
00:38:33,715 --> 00:38:35,007
Maybe...

444
00:38:35,508 --> 00:38:38,052
Jigglypuff, double slap, go!

445
00:38:40,722 --> 00:38:43,057
Charmander, use flamethrower!

446
00:38:54,944 --> 00:38:57,905
Jigglypuff is unable to battle!
Ash is the winner!

447
00:38:57,989 --> 00:38:59,865
Great work, charmander!

448
00:39:11,044 --> 00:39:14,255
You evolved into Charmeleon!
That's awesome!

449
00:39:18,718 --> 00:39:20,761
Nice to meet you! I'm verity.

450
00:39:21,387 --> 00:39:22,638
I'm sorrel.

451
00:39:23,389 --> 00:39:26,266
I hope ash hasn't been
causing you too much trouble.

452
00:39:26,309 --> 00:39:29,937
Oh, well! He's rambunctious,
but he's got a big heart.

453
00:39:30,021 --> 00:39:31,605
I hope you'll all
be good friends!

454
00:39:32,106 --> 00:39:34,066
Mom, I wish
you'd stop worrying...

455
00:39:45,495 --> 00:39:47,121
Sorrel? You find anything?

456
00:39:47,497 --> 00:39:50,917
Yes, this is an excellent book.
So well researched.

457
00:39:51,584 --> 00:39:52,501
Listen!

458
00:39:53,669 --> 00:39:54,878
From high above,

459
00:39:54,921 --> 00:39:58,049
ho-oh watched over the many works
of people and of Pokemon,

460
00:39:58,091 --> 00:40:00,384
and they experienced
the aura of happiness.

461
00:40:00,426 --> 00:40:02,177
And they received
energy from it.

462
00:40:04,055 --> 00:40:07,475
And yet, the heart of evil
stole strength from it.

463
00:40:11,062 --> 00:40:12,104
What's that?

464
00:40:12,647 --> 00:40:15,775
When the rainbow wing
touches the heart of evil,

465
00:40:15,817 --> 00:40:17,151
its color vanishes.

466
00:40:18,986 --> 00:40:20,278
The heart of evil?

467
00:40:20,405 --> 00:40:22,156
Its color vanishes?

468
00:40:24,075 --> 00:40:25,826
Looks like mine's just fine.

469
00:40:26,452 --> 00:40:29,371
Like your mom said, you may
be a little rambunctious,

470
00:40:29,455 --> 00:40:31,748
but you sure don't
have an evil heart.

471
00:40:31,791 --> 00:40:35,377
That's right! 'Cause I'm big-hearted
and rambunctious!

472
00:40:36,963 --> 00:40:37,880
Knock it off!

473
00:40:38,297 --> 00:40:40,632
That's not nice! Quit laughing!

474
00:40:47,348 --> 00:40:49,016
Pikachu, use iron tail!

475
00:40:56,774 --> 00:40:58,358
Pikachu, use thunderbolt!

476
00:41:07,493 --> 00:41:11,038
Snorlax is unable to battle!
Ash is the winner!

477
00:41:13,249 --> 00:41:14,083
All right!

478
00:41:14,167 --> 00:41:15,376
Very nice!

479
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:18,921
So, since ash was victorious,
who is his next challenger?

480
00:41:19,088 --> 00:41:20,047
What do you say, Piplup?

481
00:41:20,756 --> 00:41:21,673
Lam!

482
00:41:28,347 --> 00:41:29,556
It's cross!

483
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:31,726
So he's the trainer
you were talking about...

484
00:41:33,019 --> 00:41:34,145
I heard a rumor,

485
00:41:34,187 --> 00:41:36,814
you started working with
that useless charmander.

486
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:39,567
There's no such thing
as a useless Pokemon!

487
00:41:40,026 --> 00:41:41,694
Charmeleon, let's go!

488
00:41:45,781 --> 00:41:48,825
It actually evolved?
It doesn't matter.

489
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:51,162
A weakling is still a weakling!

490
00:41:51,787 --> 00:41:52,954
You're not even close!

491
00:41:53,456 --> 00:41:56,000
When a Pokémon works with
a trainer, it gets stronger!

492
00:41:57,627 --> 00:42:02,127
All right, my strong fire-type
Pokémon, Incineroar, to arms!

493
00:42:08,596 --> 00:42:09,597
Look at that...

494
00:42:09,889 --> 00:42:11,140
An Incineroar.

495
00:42:12,975 --> 00:42:14,101
Now come at me!

496
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,853
Charmeleon, use flamethrower!

497
00:42:22,276 --> 00:42:23,068
That's it!

498
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:27,406
Use slash!

499
00:42:34,247 --> 00:42:34,956
Yes!

500
00:42:39,043 --> 00:42:40,002
That's odd...

501
00:42:41,546 --> 00:42:44,674
Keep it up, charmeleon!
Seismic toss, now!

502
00:43:04,193 --> 00:43:05,819
Incineroar? Let's do it.

503
00:43:08,489 --> 00:43:10,532
Charmeleon, use flamethrower!

504
00:43:11,534 --> 00:43:13,160
And we'll use flamethrower, too!

505
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:24,337
Charmeleon!

506
00:43:26,924 --> 00:43:27,758
Of course.

507
00:43:29,385 --> 00:43:31,178
When Incineroar takes
enough damage,

508
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:32,846
it gains more power.

509
00:43:33,806 --> 00:43:34,890
But that means...

510
00:43:35,141 --> 00:43:36,976
It took the attacks on purpose.

511
00:43:37,977 --> 00:43:40,104
Charmeleon, use flamethrower!

512
00:43:43,482 --> 00:43:44,691
It can't keep up!

513
00:43:44,734 --> 00:43:47,027
Its newly-evolved
powers aren't ready!

514
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:49,863
Ash shouldn't be relying
on strength alone...

515
00:43:50,031 --> 00:43:51,532
Use fire fangs!

516
00:43:58,831 --> 00:43:59,998
Use throat chop!

517
00:44:16,807 --> 00:44:19,142
Let's wrap it up.
Use cross chop!

518
00:44:19,852 --> 00:44:22,396
We're not gonna lose this!
Use flamethrower!

519
00:44:23,689 --> 00:44:24,898
No, ash, you can't!

520
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,082
Charmeleon!

521
00:44:45,378 --> 00:44:49,090
Charmeleon is unable to battle!
The winner is Incineroar!

522
00:44:53,386 --> 00:44:54,720
You're too soft!

523
00:44:55,846 --> 00:44:57,722
You battled using cheap friendship,

524
00:44:57,765 --> 00:45:01,226
and called moves your Pokémon
couldn't use, so you lost.

525
00:45:01,268 --> 00:45:04,187
You're the worst trainer
I've ever seen and...

526
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:05,981
You'll never win!

527
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:15,449
Your Pokemon are
fully recovered and healthy.

528
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:16,951
Thanks very much.

529
00:45:18,369 --> 00:45:19,912
Cheer up, Charmeleon's fine!

530
00:45:29,422 --> 00:45:32,550
That guy...
His training is totally wrong!

531
00:45:32,675 --> 00:45:34,968
I know I should have
won that thing, but...

532
00:45:37,388 --> 00:45:40,307
Try as you might, you cannot
deny his convictions.

533
00:45:40,433 --> 00:45:42,393
He and Incineroar
are bonded together

534
00:45:42,435 --> 00:45:44,812
through their shared belief
in pure, raw strength.

535
00:45:46,605 --> 00:45:48,982
Even so, it's wrong for
a guy like that to win!

536
00:45:49,442 --> 00:45:52,236
Your first step needs to
be accepting that you lost.

537
00:45:52,278 --> 00:45:54,488
Can't you channel
the frustration of losing,

538
00:45:54,613 --> 00:45:57,324
into working hard,
so that you'll win next time?

539
00:45:57,616 --> 00:45:59,451
Yeah, I hear you.

540
00:46:00,661 --> 00:46:02,329
You know?

541
00:46:05,583 --> 00:46:07,459
Pikachu would've won that thing.

542
00:46:07,793 --> 00:46:09,085
Ash, you shouldn't say that!

543
00:46:09,128 --> 00:46:11,004
What if charmeleon
had heard you?!

544
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:17,302
If winning's all
you care about...

545
00:46:17,344 --> 00:46:18,845
Then you're no
different from cross.

546
00:46:23,142 --> 00:46:24,351
Ash, wait!
Hold on!

547
00:46:24,435 --> 00:46:26,019
Ash, come back!

548
00:46:35,654 --> 00:46:37,864
What's with those two
thinking they're so smart?

549
00:46:40,034 --> 00:46:42,119
Hey, I'm right,
don't you think?!

550
00:46:43,204 --> 00:46:44,788
So you're saying
it's my fault, huh?!

551
00:46:48,751 --> 00:46:50,794
Even Pikachu... man...

552
00:47:01,889 --> 00:47:05,017
If only my first Pokémon had
been a squirtle or a Bulbasaur.

553
00:47:46,225 --> 00:47:47,684
Pikachu...

554
00:47:57,152 --> 00:48:00,780
Ho-oh, I thought
I was the rainbow hero.

555
00:48:03,701 --> 00:48:05,369
Who needs Pikachu anyway?

556
00:48:05,911 --> 00:48:08,622
I'm just fine... all by myself!

557
00:48:34,148 --> 00:48:36,108
Ash ketchum,
are you still asleep?

558
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:38,527
You'll be late getting
to professor oak's class!

559
00:48:38,652 --> 00:48:40,570
Yeah, right...

560
00:48:41,822 --> 00:48:43,907
Mom, why didn't you wake me up?!

561
00:48:53,626 --> 00:48:55,044
Professor oak!

562
00:48:55,753 --> 00:48:57,421
Oh, if it isn't ash...

563
00:48:57,504 --> 00:48:58,880
Am I on time?

564
00:48:59,256 --> 00:49:01,508
There are four students
who came to school late,

565
00:49:01,592 --> 00:49:03,343
and you were
the latest of them all.

566
00:49:07,139 --> 00:49:08,473
Ash, you're late!

567
00:49:09,308 --> 00:49:10,684
I overslept a little.

568
00:49:10,768 --> 00:49:12,019
Where's your homework?

569
00:49:12,061 --> 00:49:13,187
Aw, I forgot it!

570
00:49:13,312 --> 00:49:14,646
What were you thinking?!

571
00:49:22,154 --> 00:49:23,321
Ash, what is it?

572
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:25,281
Uh... it's nothing.

573
00:49:25,699 --> 00:49:26,741
You're weird.

574
00:49:27,034 --> 00:49:29,745
The subject of today's class
is rainbows.

575
00:49:30,037 --> 00:49:34,041
Rainbows are caused by the sun's rays
moving through the atmosphere,

576
00:49:34,166 --> 00:49:36,877
and when they encounter water vapor,

577
00:49:37,002 --> 00:49:40,547
their light is bent and refracted,
causing a multicolored arc.

578
00:49:40,589 --> 00:49:42,632
Children, have you ever...

579
00:49:52,851 --> 00:49:54,352
How long are you
going to stand there?

580
00:49:55,688 --> 00:49:57,356
Aren't you sick
of that view yet?

581
00:49:57,648 --> 00:49:58,774
What's on your mind?

582
00:50:01,276 --> 00:50:03,903
I was just wondering
what's way out there.

583
00:50:04,405 --> 00:50:05,447
Let's see.

584
00:50:05,656 --> 00:50:08,909
There are forests and rivers,
and mountains...

585
00:50:09,201 --> 00:50:11,077
And there's the next town, too.

586
00:50:12,037 --> 00:50:13,204
And past that?

587
00:50:13,247 --> 00:50:16,833
More forests and rivers... And
eventually, you get to the sea.

588
00:50:17,209 --> 00:50:18,543
And past that?

589
00:50:19,294 --> 00:50:20,962
I'm sure it's more of the same.

590
00:50:21,714 --> 00:50:22,923
The thing is...

591
00:50:24,091 --> 00:50:26,093
You never know
until you go there.

592
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:30,096
For me... I wanna see what's out there
with my own eyes.

593
00:50:30,347 --> 00:50:31,389
On a journey?

594
00:50:31,432 --> 00:50:32,516
Sounds like fun.

595
00:50:32,725 --> 00:50:35,185
You don't have to worry
about school and schedules.

596
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:37,061
You can see lots of
new things in places

597
00:50:37,062 --> 00:50:38,354
you never even knew about.

598
00:50:39,481 --> 00:50:41,441
And at night,
I can look at the stars

599
00:50:41,525 --> 00:50:44,277
and talk things over
with friends I'm traveling with...

600
00:50:44,445 --> 00:50:47,406
And as long as my buddy's
with me, I can go anywhere.

601
00:50:47,531 --> 00:50:48,448
Your buddy?

602
00:50:48,449 --> 00:50:49,491
What buddy?

603
00:50:49,742 --> 00:50:51,326
You even have to ask?

604
00:50:51,535 --> 00:50:53,537
My buddy's with me all the time!

605
00:50:54,621 --> 00:50:55,955
Always...

606
00:51:03,756 --> 00:51:04,631
Oh, yeah...
Ash...

607
00:51:04,757 --> 00:51:05,716
You're crying.

608
00:51:06,008 --> 00:51:07,718
I am? So?

609
00:51:07,926 --> 00:51:09,302
So pull yourself together!

610
00:51:09,344 --> 00:51:10,470
What's the matter?

611
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:31,324
Hey, wait!

612
00:51:43,837 --> 00:51:47,006
Of course! We used to run
like this all the time!

613
00:51:49,968 --> 00:51:53,054
But... but... I can't
remember who you are!

614
00:51:53,305 --> 00:51:55,515
You were my very best friend, but...

615
00:52:02,564 --> 00:52:04,065
Do it go!

616
00:52:16,078 --> 00:52:17,329
Pikachu!

617
00:52:34,930 --> 00:52:35,847
Pikachu!

618
00:52:37,766 --> 00:52:40,894
Pikachu!
It was all my fault!

619
00:52:42,187 --> 00:52:46,065
I'm sorry!
I just... I just...

620
00:52:54,158 --> 00:52:56,076
Look, ash. Here.

621
00:52:57,286 --> 00:52:58,412
Thank you very much.

622
00:52:58,537 --> 00:53:00,789
Do you know how long
we've been looking for you?!

623
00:53:02,708 --> 00:53:04,167
Uh... Sorry.

624
00:53:04,209 --> 00:53:06,794
Do you honestly think
you're going to win every battle?

625
00:53:06,962 --> 00:53:08,922
It's the times we lose
that we truly see

626
00:53:09,006 --> 00:53:10,340
what a trainer's made of.

627
00:53:11,383 --> 00:53:12,550
But that's just my opinion.

628
00:53:18,724 --> 00:53:21,685
Charmeleon... I'm sorry.

629
00:53:23,645 --> 00:53:25,938
You forgot that
Pokemon even existed?!

630
00:53:27,024 --> 00:53:29,151
That had to have been
the worst dream ever!

631
00:53:29,526 --> 00:53:30,568
But, you know,

632
00:53:30,611 --> 00:53:32,904
it's not impossible for
Pokémon to leave us.

633
00:53:36,617 --> 00:53:38,785
When I was young,
my parents were away for work

634
00:53:38,827 --> 00:53:39,744
more than home.

635
00:53:40,078 --> 00:53:42,789
My family had a luxray
who took care of me.

636
00:53:42,956 --> 00:53:44,290
It was always with me.

637
00:53:46,084 --> 00:53:47,126
But then...

638
00:53:47,252 --> 00:53:49,629
There was one awful day
when I went out alone...

639
00:54:12,653 --> 00:54:14,154
Luxray...

640
00:54:36,802 --> 00:54:41,302
Luxray! Luxray! Luxray!

641
00:54:50,691 --> 00:54:51,817
After that...

642
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:55,194
I was afraid to make friends
with Pokémon for a very long time.

643
00:54:57,197 --> 00:54:59,574
The only thing that
snapped me out of it...

644
00:54:59,866 --> 00:55:01,325
Was when I met lucario.

645
00:55:02,995 --> 00:55:04,079
Awesome...

646
00:55:13,714 --> 00:55:14,756
What was that?!

647
00:55:14,965 --> 00:55:16,049
A Pokémon?

648
00:55:27,477 --> 00:55:28,603
They're Primeape!

649
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:31,189
Once they're angry,
there's no calming them down!

650
00:55:43,076 --> 00:55:44,535
What's going on?!

651
00:55:44,703 --> 00:55:45,912
Ash, we need metapod!

652
00:55:46,788 --> 00:55:47,872
But why?

653
00:55:47,914 --> 00:55:50,833
If we try to fight back,
they'll only get angrier!

654
00:55:51,209 --> 00:55:52,210
Got it!

655
00:56:01,845 --> 00:56:03,930
Metapod! Use string shot!

656
00:56:11,813 --> 00:56:14,065
Come on, Primeape,
don't be so mad!

657
00:56:14,608 --> 00:56:16,443
Metapod, you were awesome!

658
00:56:24,576 --> 00:56:26,327
It evolved into a butter-free!

659
00:56:28,997 --> 00:56:30,289
They're after us again!

660
00:56:30,874 --> 00:56:32,667
Butter-free, use sleep powder!

661
00:56:52,771 --> 00:56:54,314
Butterfree, you're the best!

662
00:56:55,857 --> 00:56:56,899
Now's our chance!

663
00:57:01,113 --> 00:57:03,365
Well, lookee what
we have here...

664
00:57:04,741 --> 00:57:06,576
A pack of primo Primeape!

665
00:57:06,618 --> 00:57:08,494
And they're all
blissfully asleep.

666
00:57:08,578 --> 00:57:10,580
This is a gotta
catch 'em all moment!

667
00:57:19,297 --> 00:57:22,341
We're blasting off yet again!

668
00:57:31,476 --> 00:57:32,351
A river!

669
00:57:32,436 --> 00:57:33,687
We'll take care of this!

670
00:57:34,146 --> 00:57:36,189
Now, it's your turn, Lapras!

671
00:58:20,233 --> 00:58:22,235
Look! That Butterfree's
in trouble!

672
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:25,071
Right! Butter-free, I choose you!

673
00:58:39,085 --> 00:58:41,128
Butterfree, now use gust, go!

674
00:58:51,848 --> 00:58:52,890
Awesome!

675
00:58:53,725 --> 00:58:56,269
That butter-free has
different coloring.

676
00:58:56,436 --> 00:58:57,603
It's really cute.

677
00:59:02,025 --> 00:59:03,651
I think that
Butterfree's a girl.

678
00:59:03,735 --> 00:59:04,485
That's right.

679
00:59:06,071 --> 00:59:06,905
Yeah?

680
00:59:23,547 --> 00:59:24,339
There!

681
00:59:24,548 --> 00:59:27,551
The source of the rainbow.
The Raizen mountains!

682
00:59:40,105 --> 00:59:41,981
That's the highest mountain
in the range.

683
00:59:42,065 --> 00:59:43,024
<i>Mount tense“!</i>

684
00:59:45,068 --> 00:59:46,819
You mean that's
where we're going?

685
00:59:46,861 --> 00:59:47,653
That's right.

686
00:59:48,113 --> 00:59:49,864
Then I'll meet ho-oh real soon!

687
00:59:50,865 --> 00:59:52,157
Pikachu. Let's go!

688
00:59:53,618 --> 00:59:54,368
Ash!

689
00:59:56,162 --> 00:59:57,163
You hear that?

690
00:59:57,205 --> 00:59:58,456
With stereo ears.

691
00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:00,166
We're ho-oh catchers!

692
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,168
Sneaky and snarky!
Sneaky and snarky!

693
01:00:09,467 --> 01:00:12,011
Oh wow, look at
all the butterfree!

694
01:00:15,265 --> 01:00:17,725
All right...
Time for you to come out!

695
01:00:26,359 --> 01:00:28,361
Isn't that the one
butterfree rescued?

696
01:00:28,445 --> 01:00:29,195
Sure is!

697
01:00:30,697 --> 01:00:32,990
This is the season when
butter-free gather in groups,

698
01:00:33,033 --> 01:00:34,868
and head south to
their spawning grounds.

699
01:00:35,285 --> 01:00:36,286
Whoa...

700
01:00:36,328 --> 01:00:38,288
Look! Your Butterfree's
joining in.

701
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:40,206
That's their courtship dance.

702
01:00:46,838 --> 01:00:48,214
I'd say they both agree...

703
01:00:48,256 --> 01:00:49,840
Good for you, butterfree!

704
01:00:50,175 --> 01:00:53,052
But, ash, you know if they
both fly off to the south...

705
01:00:53,261 --> 01:00:55,388
That means goodbye
to butterfree.

706
01:01:02,937 --> 01:01:05,689
But... That's...
Not what I want to happen.

707
01:01:06,399 --> 01:01:09,026
I mean, Butterfree's
one of my good friends!

708
01:01:10,862 --> 01:01:13,114
I don't want to say goodbye.
No way!

709
01:01:13,990 --> 01:01:15,908
Yeah, I hear you.

710
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:18,578
It's your decision,
what do you say?

711
01:01:28,254 --> 01:01:30,881
Hi. So what do you
think you wanna do?

712
01:01:32,342 --> 01:01:34,761
Do you really wanna go with
the rest of the butter-free...

713
01:01:34,844 --> 01:01:36,345
And say goodbye to all of us?

714
01:02:02,247 --> 01:02:03,748
You should go with your friend!

715
01:02:06,584 --> 01:02:09,461
Hurry up! If you don't go now,
you'll both get left behind!

716
01:02:09,713 --> 01:02:12,132
You're both...
Really great butter-free,

717
01:02:12,173 --> 01:02:13,549
so take care of each other!

718
01:02:29,065 --> 01:02:30,858
You take good care
of yourselves!

719
01:02:32,110 --> 01:02:34,070
Now you two be
careful out there!

720
01:02:41,745 --> 01:02:44,956
Butferfree!
Take care of yourself!

721
01:03:09,898 --> 01:03:10,940
They're gone...

722
01:03:11,107 --> 01:03:12,149
Yeah...

723
01:03:13,818 --> 01:03:16,779
But you know, I'm really
glad I met butter-free.

724
01:03:17,322 --> 01:03:21,034
True, it's not here...
But we'll always be good friends.

725
01:03:24,454 --> 01:03:25,705
One thing's for sure.

726
01:03:26,247 --> 01:03:30,084
Trainers raise Pokemon, but
Pokemon live their own lives.

727
01:03:38,676 --> 01:03:39,718
It's raikou!

728
01:04:04,828 --> 01:04:07,664
It looks like something's
made the wild Pokémon upset.

729
01:04:07,872 --> 01:04:08,581
It does.

730
01:04:08,665 --> 01:04:09,832
It's ho-oh!

731
01:04:10,208 --> 01:04:11,667
All of them gather here!

732
01:04:11,709 --> 01:04:15,713
All of these wild Pokemon want
to receive power from ho-oh.

733
01:04:20,301 --> 01:04:22,761
It's faint, but I'm
catching a whiff of ho-oh.

734
01:04:23,263 --> 01:04:24,472
Hey, could it be this?

735
01:04:25,849 --> 01:04:28,518
Wow! It's the rainbow wing!

736
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:29,602
You know of it?

737
01:04:29,894 --> 01:04:31,687
Hey! I know you!

738
01:04:31,729 --> 01:04:33,939
You wrote the book!
What was your name?

739
01:04:34,190 --> 01:04:36,442
Why don't you just
call me Bonji?

740
01:04:37,318 --> 01:04:40,321
For the past twenty years,
I've been on a quest,

741
01:04:40,405 --> 01:04:42,990
searching for ho-oh as
part of my research.

742
01:04:43,074 --> 01:04:44,283
Twenty years?

743
01:04:44,576 --> 01:04:47,161
You see, I've pulled
data from many places,

744
01:04:47,245 --> 01:04:50,373
which led me to this mountain
for ho-oh's next appearance.

745
01:04:50,498 --> 01:04:52,041
Then let's all go together!

746
01:04:52,292 --> 01:04:54,794
Yeah we're on our way
to see ho-oh as well.

747
01:04:57,171 --> 01:05:00,966
All right. That shine is
the shine of youth.

748
01:05:01,759 --> 01:05:03,135
How I missed it.

749
01:05:03,261 --> 01:05:06,889
It's almost too beautiful
for me to look upon.

750
01:05:07,682 --> 01:05:11,227
It's probably thanks in large part
to the rainbow wing...

751
01:05:11,269 --> 01:05:14,689
That you were able to come across
entei, suicune, and raikou.

752
01:05:16,441 --> 01:05:19,318
Ho-oh wants to know if there
is a young person out there

753
01:05:19,402 --> 01:05:21,153
suited to be the rainbow hero.

754
01:05:21,446 --> 01:05:22,405
You mean me?

755
01:05:22,447 --> 01:05:24,490
That means you may
have someone guiding you.

756
01:05:24,574 --> 01:05:28,077
A guide from the shadows.
Have you noticed anything?

757
01:05:28,953 --> 01:05:31,997
From the shadows?
Wait, yeah there was something...

758
01:05:32,582 --> 01:05:34,208
I wonder if it's still there...

759
01:05:34,918 --> 01:05:39,088
I suspect it's an extremely
rare Pokemon. Marshadow.

760
01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:39,839
Marshadow?

761
01:05:39,923 --> 01:05:43,134
Yes. They say it's a guide
from the shadows.

762
01:05:43,217 --> 01:05:45,260
When a color of
the rainbow fades,

763
01:05:45,303 --> 01:05:48,139
marshadow seals it back up
and makes it right.

764
01:05:50,642 --> 01:05:51,601
There's the summit...

765
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:53,144
The rainbow wing!

766
01:06:09,953 --> 01:06:13,206
When a rainbow flower
blooms upon rainbow rock,

767
01:06:13,289 --> 01:06:15,082
ho-oh shall appear.

768
01:06:15,166 --> 01:06:17,293
Well, I can't just
stand here waiting!

769
01:06:17,335 --> 01:06:18,669
Let's go, buddy!

770
01:06:19,754 --> 01:06:21,505
Hey, wait for me!

771
01:06:23,466 --> 01:06:26,719
Time flies, and rainbows
quickly vanish.

772
01:06:27,095 --> 01:06:29,138
Yes, young ones. Hurry!

773
01:06:31,808 --> 01:06:34,477
The "young ones" have to hurry!

774
01:06:35,770 --> 01:06:37,855
I'm not feeling
all that young...

775
01:06:37,897 --> 01:06:39,398
Hurrying's for the harried...

776
01:06:41,234 --> 01:06:43,319
And all on an empty stomach.
And all on an empty stomach.

777
01:06:54,330 --> 01:06:55,956
That's where you should
place the rainbow wing.

778
01:06:57,959 --> 01:06:59,085
I'll do it!

779
01:07:10,596 --> 01:07:12,806
It's cross! What's going on?!

780
01:07:13,224 --> 01:07:14,516
I'll take that!

781
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:16,852
The trainer who battles ho-oh
is the strongest,

782
01:07:16,894 --> 01:07:18,353
and that trainer is me!

783
01:07:18,396 --> 01:07:19,605
That's not how it works!

784
01:07:19,731 --> 01:07:23,276
Now look! The one who gets to
battle ho-oh is the chosen one!

785
01:07:23,443 --> 01:07:24,402
The rainbow hero!

786
01:07:24,569 --> 01:07:25,736
You're too soft.

787
01:07:25,778 --> 01:07:28,405
Remember might makes right.
And that's it.

788
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:30,158
So, what about the weak then?

789
01:07:30,241 --> 01:07:31,116
They're trash!

790
01:07:31,534 --> 01:07:32,451
And people who lose?

791
01:07:32,493 --> 01:07:33,619
Worse than trash!

792
01:07:34,412 --> 01:07:37,331
There's no way I can
afford to let you win this!

793
01:07:45,590 --> 01:07:46,674
You're marshadow!

794
01:07:48,718 --> 01:07:50,511
That's the Pokémon
we saw that night!

795
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,304
Marshadow is so cute...

796
01:07:52,346 --> 01:07:54,806
That's the guide
from the shadows? Wow.

797
01:07:59,395 --> 01:08:03,148
Marshadow... Its only purpose
is to observe the proceedings.

798
01:08:03,232 --> 01:08:04,024
<i>Bony?</i>

799
01:08:07,653 --> 01:08:09,655
Charmeleon! I choose you!

800
01:08:14,827 --> 01:08:16,245
Use flamethrower!

801
01:08:18,164 --> 01:08:19,415
Charge, charmeleon!

802
01:08:22,210 --> 01:08:23,794
Charmeleon, now use slash!

803
01:08:28,966 --> 01:08:29,841
Perfect!

804
01:08:30,927 --> 01:08:32,178
Throat chop, go!

805
01:08:40,311 --> 01:08:41,437
Use slash again!

806
01:08:47,110 --> 01:08:48,194
Use flamethrower!

807
01:08:50,113 --> 01:08:51,030
Charmeleon!

808
01:09:14,595 --> 01:09:16,096
You evolved into a Charizard!

809
01:09:17,348 --> 01:09:18,682
Go Charizard!

810
01:09:18,808 --> 01:09:19,934
Aw, who cares?

811
01:09:20,017 --> 01:09:22,728
Even when weak Pokemon evolve,
they're still weak!

812
01:09:22,895 --> 01:09:24,187
Now use throat chop!

813
01:09:24,772 --> 01:09:26,315
Charizard, use slash!

814
01:09:33,865 --> 01:09:35,199
Use flamethrower!

815
01:09:42,832 --> 01:09:44,124
Now use dragon rage!

816
01:09:55,052 --> 01:09:57,721
Charizard! We've gotta
wrap this up quick!

817
01:09:57,847 --> 01:09:59,265
Build up your power.

818
01:09:59,307 --> 01:10:01,183
Let's end this one
with a big attack!

819
01:10:02,101 --> 01:10:04,019
All right, fire fang!

820
01:10:07,231 --> 01:10:08,273
Dodge it, quick!

821
01:10:13,988 --> 01:10:15,364
Grab and drag it down!

822
01:10:18,993 --> 01:10:20,077
Use seismic toss!

823
01:10:33,216 --> 01:10:35,384
Incineroar, use flamethrower!

824
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:39,305
Charizard, use flamethrower!

825
01:10:45,770 --> 01:10:47,271
Go!

826
01:11:11,128 --> 01:11:12,963
Alright!
You did it, Charizard!

827
01:11:33,943 --> 01:11:36,153
Ho-oh...
I saw ho-oh, too!

828
01:11:38,155 --> 01:11:40,699
But it didn't gift me
with the rainbow wing!

829
01:11:40,825 --> 01:11:42,743
And here
I did everything I could

830
01:11:42,827 --> 01:11:45,037
to become
the strongest trainer of all!

831
01:11:46,706 --> 01:11:48,207
Why must it be you?!

832
01:11:48,291 --> 01:11:50,584
If ho-oh doesn't consider
me the strongest,

833
01:11:50,668 --> 01:11:52,002
I'll just crush ho-oh!

834
01:11:52,044 --> 01:11:53,128
But, cross...

835
01:11:53,713 --> 01:11:55,715
I wanna get stronger, too, you know.

836
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:59,385
But still, I only got this far
with the help of my friends!

837
01:11:59,468 --> 01:12:01,761
So I know it's not
only about strength!

838
01:12:02,096 --> 01:12:03,889
Then what do you
even battle for?!

839
01:12:04,056 --> 01:12:05,474
I do it...

840
01:12:06,350 --> 01:12:08,060
Because I wanna make friends!

841
01:12:09,770 --> 01:12:11,104
Not just with ho-oh!

842
01:12:11,188 --> 01:12:14,065
I wanna make friends with
all kinds of Pokémon!

843
01:12:14,317 --> 01:12:15,443
That's why I battle!

844
01:12:26,495 --> 01:12:27,454
Not good!

845
01:12:32,877 --> 01:12:35,004
Now come to me, ho-oh!

846
01:12:53,647 --> 01:12:55,607
You see, the rainbow wing...

847
01:12:55,733 --> 01:12:59,778
Loses its color when touched
by one with an evil heart.

848
01:13:06,369 --> 01:13:07,495
What?!

849
01:13:14,210 --> 01:13:17,296
Marshadow seals it back up,
and makes it right.

850
01:13:21,175 --> 01:13:24,303
I'll pound you down, too!
Lycanroc, use crush claw!

851
01:13:37,441 --> 01:13:38,108
Oh no!

852
01:13:38,150 --> 01:13:40,318
Marshadow's
controlling lycanroc!

853
01:13:40,486 --> 01:13:43,280
It wants to tear people
and Pokémon apart!

854
01:13:52,915 --> 01:13:54,041
You just...

855
01:13:54,375 --> 01:13:55,584
Don't you see?!

856
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:58,963
That means it never forgot
you were once its trainer!

857
01:13:59,422 --> 01:14:01,674
That's just like Charizard
to be awesome!

858
01:14:23,362 --> 01:14:24,446
Lucaflo!

859
01:14:25,990 --> 01:14:27,533
Pikachu! Use thunderbolt!

860
01:14:35,833 --> 01:14:38,961
It looks like marshadow wants
to control all of you as well!

861
01:14:39,295 --> 01:14:40,212
No way!

862
01:14:40,296 --> 01:14:42,715
Ho-oh will never appear
now that it's come to this!

863
01:14:52,224 --> 01:14:53,391
Is everyone all right?

864
01:14:53,684 --> 01:14:55,060
Yeah... I think so...

865
01:14:58,856 --> 01:15:01,775
Young man, you have got to
get the rainbow wing back.

866
01:15:02,943 --> 01:15:06,780
Marshadow is getting its
power from the rainbow wing!

867
01:15:07,072 --> 01:15:10,283
And there's only person who
can get it back.

868
01:15:10,367 --> 01:15:11,826
That is you!

869
01:15:16,999 --> 01:15:18,166
Then I've gotta do it!

870
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:21,253
We'll do whatever
we can to help out!

871
01:15:21,378 --> 01:15:22,337
All right!

872
01:15:22,463 --> 01:15:23,422
This way!

873
01:15:25,591 --> 01:15:27,259
Charizard, use flamethrower!

874
01:15:33,432 --> 01:15:34,766
Use hydro pump!

875
01:16:02,169 --> 01:16:03,128
No, don't!

876
01:16:06,632 --> 01:16:07,633
Cross!

877
01:16:09,468 --> 01:16:11,803
I've gotta do this! Go!

878
01:16:16,725 --> 01:16:19,644
You bit me the day we met too,
remember?

879
01:16:20,437 --> 01:16:21,479
Remember?

880
01:16:21,897 --> 01:16:23,815
Lycanroc, remember!

881
01:16:39,832 --> 01:16:41,250
Lycanroc.

882
01:16:42,501 --> 01:16:44,461
Marshadow!
Give me the rainbow wing.

883
01:16:50,926 --> 01:16:52,761
Hit it right back
with iron tail!

884
01:17:00,894 --> 01:17:01,895
Keep it up!

885
01:17:07,484 --> 01:17:08,568
Lucaflo!

886
01:17:19,163 --> 01:17:19,872
Cross!

887
01:17:36,513 --> 01:17:37,514
Pikachu!

888
01:17:41,435 --> 01:17:42,769
Let's go, buddy!

889
01:17:54,990 --> 01:17:56,032
Dodge it!

890
01:18:00,371 --> 01:18:01,997
Pikachu, use thunderbolt!

891
01:18:37,116 --> 01:18:38,367
Pikachu!

892
01:19:13,110 --> 01:19:14,486
Oh, ash...

893
01:19:34,798 --> 01:19:37,091
Pikachu! Get inside, please?

894
01:19:39,970 --> 01:19:44,470
I know you can't stand going
inside your poké ball, but...

895
01:19:44,975 --> 01:19:46,685
You'll be protected!

896
01:19:56,403 --> 01:19:59,114
Now you look, I don't think
you know who you're dealing with!

897
01:19:59,490 --> 01:20:01,658
I'm Ash Ketchum,
from pallet town!

898
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:04,577
And I'm gonna be the world's

899
01:20:04,661 --> 01:20:06,871
greatest Pokemon master!

900
01:20:07,372 --> 01:20:09,540
Mess with me
and you're gonna lose!

901
01:20:36,443 --> 01:20:40,071
Pikachu, why won't you
get in your poké ball?

902
01:20:42,032 --> 01:20:43,742
It's because...

903
01:20:45,536 --> 01:20:46,745
It's because...

904
01:20:46,787 --> 01:20:50,582
I always want...
To be with you...

905
01:20:53,293 --> 01:20:55,086
Pikachu, you...

906
01:23:05,175 --> 01:23:08,553
Pikachu... you guys...
Where are you?

907
01:23:34,746 --> 01:23:36,080
Pikachu!

908
01:23:48,385 --> 01:23:50,261
We used to run like
this all the time!

909
01:24:37,100 --> 01:24:38,351
Pikachu!

910
01:24:59,790 --> 01:25:00,832
Pikachu...

911
01:25:02,209 --> 01:25:03,210
Ash!

912
01:25:03,627 --> 01:25:04,836
You're alright!

913
01:25:05,462 --> 01:25:07,464
Verity! Sorrel!

914
01:25:25,315 --> 01:25:28,985
When a rainbow flower
blooms upon rainbow rock,

915
01:25:29,152 --> 01:25:30,820
ho-oh shall appear.

916
01:25:33,490 --> 01:25:35,575
Yes! Now go, young man!

917
01:26:28,211 --> 01:26:30,796
The one who is guided
by the rainbow wing...

918
01:26:30,881 --> 01:26:34,593
May meet ho-oh...
And become the rainbow hero.

919
01:26:41,099 --> 01:26:42,141
Ho?

920
01:26:42,225 --> 01:26:43,601
Oh!

921
01:26:43,643 --> 01:26:45,269
Yo, ho, ho-oh ho!

922
01:26:49,232 --> 01:26:51,192
It's all downhill from here!
It's all downhill from here!

923
01:27:26,436 --> 01:27:28,604
Looks like everybody's
healthy again!

924
01:27:28,772 --> 01:27:31,024
And that's the power of ho-oh!

925
01:27:31,107 --> 01:27:32,149
Pikachu?

926
01:27:41,701 --> 01:27:44,495
Ho-oh! Let's have a battle!

927
01:28:08,812 --> 01:28:11,272
Pikachu! I choose you!

928
01:28:12,482 --> 01:28:14,192
Alright! Use thunderbolt!

929
01:28:56,693 --> 01:28:57,652
Excuse me!

930
01:28:59,696 --> 01:29:02,240
Oh, my! You were battling,
weren't you?

931
01:29:02,532 --> 01:29:03,574
Who was it this time?

932
01:29:03,992 --> 01:29:05,118
It was ho-oh.

933
01:29:05,452 --> 01:29:06,536
That's nice...

934
01:29:08,538 --> 01:29:09,539
What?

935
01:29:13,710 --> 01:29:15,586
The atmosphere is crystal clear!

936
01:29:16,046 --> 01:29:17,422
Somewhere in the world...

937
01:29:17,547 --> 01:29:21,592
There's a new trainer,
soon to be the rainbow hero.

938
01:29:22,510 --> 01:29:24,011
Young men and women, live on!

939
01:29:24,054 --> 01:29:25,972
Just keep on living on!

940
01:29:26,056 --> 01:29:28,933
And if you do,
a path will open for you!

941
01:29:29,059 --> 01:29:32,604
The future is bathed in
a rainbow-colored light!

942
01:29:41,321 --> 01:29:44,699
I'm going to get even stronger.
And someday we'll battle again.

943
01:29:45,158 --> 01:29:47,952
Okay! And I'll give it
everything I've got!

944
01:29:49,245 --> 01:29:51,956
Just don't lose
to anyone before then.

945
01:30:02,217 --> 01:30:04,052
This is where
our paths must part.

946
01:30:04,094 --> 01:30:05,595
I'm off to learn
about the legends of

947
01:30:05,637 --> 01:30:08,222
Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres.

948
01:30:08,556 --> 01:30:10,724
I think I'm going
to head on back home.

949
01:30:10,809 --> 01:30:12,519
I'd really like to see my mom!

950
01:30:12,602 --> 01:30:13,769
What about you?

951
01:30:13,937 --> 01:30:16,731
You know me!
I'm going my own way!

952
01:30:17,023 --> 01:30:19,108
Working to become
a Pokémon master!

953
01:30:20,443 --> 01:30:22,987
I hope we get to meet again
in the future.

954
01:30:30,495 --> 01:30:32,330
Then we'll have a battle!
Then we'll have a battle!

955
01:31:10,618 --> 01:31:12,036
Let's go, Pikachu!

956
01:31:18,835 --> 01:31:21,546
The always-fascinating
world of Pokémon,

957
01:31:21,588 --> 01:31:24,591
the most diverse and
unusual creatures on the planet.

958
01:31:24,716 --> 01:31:29,137
They can be found up in the sky,
under the sea, in forests,

959
01:31:29,179 --> 01:31:30,388
and living in towns.

960
01:31:30,805 --> 01:31:34,225
One can see Pokémon in
every corner of the world!

961
01:31:34,434 --> 01:31:38,104
People and Pokémon,
forming all kinds of bonds,

962
01:31:38,146 --> 01:31:40,106
and living
harmoniously in a world

963
01:31:40,148 --> 01:31:41,649
made just for them...

964
01:31:47,238 --> 01:31:50,407
And this young man,
Ash Ketchum from pallet town,

965
01:31:50,450 --> 01:31:53,578
together with his partner Pikachu,
continues to work

966
01:31:53,620 --> 01:31:56,789
toward his goal of
becoming a Pokémon master.

967
01:31:57,707 --> 01:31:59,917
And as many
Pokémon as there are...

968
01:31:59,959 --> 01:32:03,253
Well, our hero has just
as many dreams to follow,

969
01:32:03,254 --> 01:32:06,507
and just as many
adventures to come!

970
