1
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,973
My name is Alice.

2
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,184
l worked for
the Umbrella Corporation...

3
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:32,104
...the largest and most powerful
commercial entity in the world.

4
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,733
l was head of security at a secret
high-tech facility called the Hive...

5
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:41,447
...a giant underground laboratory
developing experimental, viral weaponry.

6
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:43,741
There was an incident.

7
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,535
A virus escaped.

8
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,664
A lot of people died.

9
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:55,419
The trouble was,
they didn't stay dead.

10
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:00,800
The computer that controlled the Hive
was a state-of-the-art...

11
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,344
...artificial intelligence:
the Red Queen.

12
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:10,393
The Red Queen responded to the threat
of the viral outbreak in an extreme way.

13
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:12,603
She went homicidal.

14
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:15,106
You're all going to die down here.

15
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,274
The Red Queen
attempted to kill everyone...

16
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,027
-Down!
-...whether they were infected or not.

17
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:26,450
l managed to escape,
but this was only the beginning.

18
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:33,207
Viral outbreaks spread like wildfire...

19
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:37,420
...first across the United States,
then the world.

20
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:42,758
The T-Virus didn't just
bring the dead back to life.

21
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:45,845
lt mutated them in terrifying ways.

22
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,765
Despite the apocalypse
they had created...

23
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:54,103
...the Umbrella Corporation continued
to experiment with the deadly virus.

24
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:56,647
l was infected.

25
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:59,984
But the virus bonded with me
on a cellular level.

26
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:02,528
l developed powers.

27
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,573
Your genetic structure is the key.

28
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:07,408
l became different.

29
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,703
Powerful.

30
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,705
Unstoppable.

31
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:18,002
As l got stronger,
the human race became weaker.

32
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:22,173
I tried my best to lead
what survivors l could find to safety...

33
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,675
...but we were pursued relentlessly.

34
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:28,054
Even my friend Jill Valentine was seized
and brainwashed by Umbrella.

35
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,638
Shoot to kill.

36
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,933
Finally, l confronted
the head of the Umbrella Corporation...

37
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,186
...Albert Wesker.

38
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:39,607
He robbed me of my powers,
but l still managed to defeat him.

39
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:43,527
At last, we thought it was over.

40
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,405
We thought we had survived
the horror.

41
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,744
But we were wrong.

42
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:56,248
Once again,
we found ourselves fighting...

43
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,917
...for our lives.

44
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,510
Go, go, go!

45
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,690
Rise and shine.

46
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,318
Come on, babe. We're late.

47
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,404
The alarm didn't go off.

48
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:10,656
Becky's not up yet.

49
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,367
Miss Henderson's gonna be pissed.

50
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:17,121
You know how they get
when you drop her off late at the school.

51
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,589
Babe? You all right, babe?

52
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,258
Yeah.

53
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,179
l'll go get Becky.

54
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,267
l charged your batteries for you.

55
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:45,024
Becky, you know Miss Henderson...

56
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,652
...she wants you to speak
while you sign.

57
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,613
Thank you, Daddy.

58
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:55,784
When you come back from school,
l have a surprise for you.

59
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,036
l heard that.

60
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,707
These batteries
are lasting less and less.

61
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,209
We need to get some new ones.

62
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,585
l can pick some up...

63
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,921
-...on my way home.
-l'm gonna be late again.

64
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,466
Shit.

65
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,092
l'll get you another shirt...

66
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,594
...from the bedroom.

67
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,930
Someone picked up
your dry-cleaning yesterday.

68
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,350
You are my little angel, aren't you?

69
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,143
You're gonna be late, remember?

70
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:22,603
Oh, yeah.

71
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,024
l'll get you that shirt.

72
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:30,236
Get Becky back!

73
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:39,245
No!

74
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:47,044
Help! Help us!

75
00:09:58,515 --> 00:09:59,598
Come on. Come on!

76
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:01,600
Come on.

77
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:22,579
Go.

78
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:23,766
Go!

79
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,310
No!

80
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,992
-Back!
-Wait!

81
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,035
-Wait!
-Stay back!

82
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:47,790
What is wrong with you?

83
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:50,876
Come on, get in.

84
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,727
What's going on?

85
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,104
Your guess is as good as mine.

86
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,313
Why are these people...

87
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:14,191
-...doing this?
-Those things are not people. Not any--

88
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,675
Are you hurt?

89
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,222
Can you move? Okay.

90
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:57,359
Come on.

91
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:06,910
Oh, shit!

92
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,253
Mommy.

93
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:17,421
Mommy, come on.

94
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:18,755
Go!

95
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,510
I love you.

96
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,572
Project Alice...

97
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:51,450
...why did you turn against Umbrella?

98
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,160
Jill?

99
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:55,245
ls that you?

100
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,039
Project Alice...

101
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,417
...why did you turn against Umbrella?

102
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:03,045
What happened to Chris and Claire?

103
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,921
Where are the others from the ship?

104
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:24,191
Project Alice...

105
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:27,444
...who do you work for?

106
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:30,530
Project Alice...

107
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:34,660
...who do you work for?

108
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:39,706
Jill, why are you doing this?

109
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,357
Warning. Warning.

110
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,403
Unauthorized computer access.

111
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,905
Security system disabled.

112
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:15,867
Central computer reboot

113
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:20,539
Security system disabled.

114
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:21,998
Central...

115
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,375
...computer reboot...

116
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,502
...in one minute...

117
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,837
...50 seconds.

118
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,341
Security system disabled.

119
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:35,554
Central computer reboot
in one minute 40 seconds.

120
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,600
Security system disabled.

121
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,562
Central computer reboot...

122
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,564
...in 30 seconds.

123
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,818

Central computer reboot
in 1 0 seconds.

127
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:06,001
Central computer rebooting.

128
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,431
Scramble all security teams.

129
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:20,474
And sweep...

130
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,517
...the corridor with the laser grid.

131
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:47,811
Stand by.

132
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:53,066
Tokyo sequence initialized.

133
00:24:47,862 --> 00:24:52,949
Stand by.

134
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:02,959
Welcome to Umbrella Central Control.

135
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:28,568
Oh, yeah.

136
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:54,010
Don't.

137
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:55,970
-My name is--
-Ada Wong.

138
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:59,849
Operative for the Umbrella Corporation,
one of Albert Wesker's top agents.

139
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:03,770
l know exactly who and what you are.

140
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:05,813
Now, the real question is:

141
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,274
Why don't l just cancel
your contract right now?

142
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:11,236
l don't work for Umbrella anymore...

143
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:14,197
...and neither does Albert Wesker.

144
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:15,615
l don't care.

145
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:17,533
You can kill her if you like...

146
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:20,119
...but then you'll never get out
of this place.

147
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,330
-Wesker.
-Now, be a good girl.

148
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:23,623
Put down the knife.

149
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:27,210
And, Alice...

150
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:29,504
...how nice to see you again.

151
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:31,756
How did she get out?

152
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,716
She's obviously getting help.

153
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:36,469
We have a traitor in this facility.

154
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:38,805
Security systems were shut down
for two minutes.

155
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:41,140
-What about Control?
-We still...

156
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,517
...can't raise them.

157
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:46,688
l executed everyone...

158
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,815
...in this control room.

159
00:26:48,983 --> 00:26:51,150
l enabled Wesker
to hack the mainframe.

160
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:54,153
We shut down the security systems.

161
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:55,905
We let you out of that cell.

162
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:59,075
We have to get you out of this facility.

163
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:02,328
-So why do you want to help me?
-We need you.

164
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:04,914
The human race faces extinction.

165
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:08,626
Our only hope of survival
is for us to work together.

166
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,003
l'm not going anywhere...

167
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,923
...until l know where we are
and what the hell is going on here.

168
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:16,509
You're in the Prime Umbrella
testing facility.

169
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:18,469
Explain Tokyo.

170
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,097
What you saw was just
a detailed re-creation...

171
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:22,932
...nothing more.

172
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,393
lt goes on for a few city blocks.

173
00:27:26,437 --> 00:27:27,395
That's all.

174
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:29,063
l was outside.

175
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:30,106
Were you?

176
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:32,400
Saw the sky, did you?

177
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:35,820
-lt was night.
-Stars? The moon?

178
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:41,200
The testing floor is 300 feet high,
the ceiling black.

179
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,119
It's usually night in there.

180
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:45,538
But isn't that when
the monsters come out anyway?

181
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,499
-lt was raining.
-Climate control.

182
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,668
Wind, rain.

183
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,962
They can even make it snow
if they want to.

184
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:55,548
-Why build such a place?
-Simple.

185
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,760
The Umbrella Corporation
derived its primary income...

186
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,928
...from the sale of viral weaponry...

187
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,514
...something that's impossible
to test in the real...

188
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,767
...world. They re-created the center...

189
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,060
...of New York...

190
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:10,146
...simulated an outbreak,
showed it to the Russians...

191
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:12,440
...and sold them the virus.

192
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:16,611
They simulated an outbreak in Moscow,
sold it to the Americans.

193
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:18,112
An outbreak in Tokyo.

194
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:19,989
Sold it to the Chinese.

195
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:23,076
-An outbreak in China.
-Sold it to the Japanese.

196
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:26,704
Exactly. Everyone had to have it.

197
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:29,791
The Umbrella Corporation
built a new arms race.

198
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,417
Only, this time...

199
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:34,629
...it was biological rather than nuclear.

200
00:28:34,797 --> 00:28:36,005
Highly profitable.

201
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:39,008
And this is where it all happened.

202
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:41,094
This is Umbrella's greatest creation.

203
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,680
The belly of the beast.

204
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:47,308
So why don't we
just get the hell out of here?

205
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,310
Stop.

206
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,022
Sunup is in less than a minute.

207
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:54,732
Why don't you...

208
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,859
...just see for yourself?

209
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:59,821
This facility is located
in the straits of Kamchatka...

210
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:03,866
...northern Russia.
The old Soviet Union...

211
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:06,494
...built submarine pens here
in the '80s.

212
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,496
After the Cold War ended...

213
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:11,958
...the Umbrella Corporation
expanded them...

214
00:29:12,126 --> 00:29:14,669
...and built the testing floor.

215
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:21,551
No one has ever escaped
from this facility.

216
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,720
lce.

217
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,056
You'll need all the help you can get...

218
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:31,102
...so l've arranged for a strike team
to enter from the surface and assist you.

219
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,523
There they are.

220
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:20,276
lntake vents for the Umbrella facility.

221
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,113
Looks abandoned.

222
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,157
That's what they want you to think.

223
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,410
Let's move. We have just two hours...

224
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:30,912
...to extract Alice and Ada.

225
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:34,290
After that, we can expect
heavy Umbrella reinforcements.

226
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:47,678
Running a bypass.

227
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:53,142
These are...

228
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,352
...the codes from Ada.

229
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:55,728
Do you trust her?

230
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:57,355
Just enter the numbers.

231
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,737
The charges are set.

232
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:08,991
We're in.

233
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:27,218
Let's go do this.

234
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,845
They're in.

235
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:33,599
The strike team has secured an elevator
for your escape to the surface.

236
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:35,726
They will eliminate
Umbrella resistance...

237
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,395
...then rendezvous with us...

238
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:38,771
...and escort us out.

239
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:40,189
They have a friend...

240
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:41,524
...of yours with them.

241
00:31:41,692 --> 00:31:43,192
Luther West.

242
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,860
He's alive?

243
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,530
All right. Hold on, ladies.

244
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:58,958
Synchronize watches.
Two hours exactly in...

245
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:01,836
...three, two, one, mark.

246
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:09,635
Leon...

247
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:10,595
...why don't we...

248
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:11,679
...trigger remotely?

249
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,098
Can't risk them jamming the signal.

250
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:18,853
And whether we succeed or not,
this facility has to be destroyed.

251
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:22,189
What if we take longer than two hours?

252
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,984
Then l hope you're really good
at holding your breath.

253
00:32:26,737 --> 00:32:30,740
Security Chief Valentine
has reached the Tokyo test environment.

254
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:31,741
She's tracking...

255
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:32,783
...you.

256
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,577
They're headed this way.

257
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,121
Her orders are to recapture you...

258
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,414
...if possible...

259
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:41,250
...terminate you if necessary.

260
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:43,210
Who's giving these orders?

261
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,503
The Red Queen.

262
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,589
-The computer?
-Yes.

263
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:50,217
The same artificial intelligence
you encountered in the Hive.

264
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:53,721
She now controls what remains
of the Umbrella Corporation.

265
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:57,183
She will stop at nothing
to prevent you escaping to the surface.

266
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:58,726
l've plotted...

267
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:00,186
...an escape route for you.

268
00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:03,105
You'll cross the New York
environment to Suburbia...

269
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:05,483
...where you'll rendezvous
with the strike team.

270
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:08,527
They'll escort you
through the Moscow environment...

271
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,696
...to the submarine pens.

272
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:13,199
And take the elevator
back to the surface.

273
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,993
The Red Queen
has intercepted my signal.

274
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:19,080
She's about to regain control
of this facility.

275
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,581
You must hurry. l can't--

276
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,794
Don't listen to the traitor Wesker.

277
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,088
l am in control now.

278
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:28,255
Project Alice...

279
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:29,382
...Ada Wong...

280
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:30,966
...stay where you are.

281
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:32,927
-Let's move.
-Project Alice...

282
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:37,223
...you're all going to die down here.

283
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:40,059
l've heard that before.

284
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:03,666
Defensive formation.

285
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:05,835
Mark your targets.

286
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:07,545
Fire at will.

287
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,063
Submarine pens are up ahead.

288
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:31,360
Barry, you and l take point.

289
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:35,865
We rendezvous with Alice and Ada
in 30 minutes.

290
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,383
Clear.

291
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,184
Now, that's some hardware.

292
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,226
Typhoon class.

293
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:07,772
The biggest nuclear subs
the Soviets ever built.

294
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:12,109
Umbrella used them to secretly transport
bioweapons all over the globe.

295
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:15,070
Let's pick up the pace.
We have less than 90 minutes.

296
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:17,031
lntruders detected.

297
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:18,449
Targeted for termination.

298
00:35:23,497 --> 00:35:25,122
New York.

299
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:27,249
We need to cross two more...

300
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:29,043
...test environments to escape.

301
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:29,919
Let's move.

302
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:32,254
Why would Umbrella continue
to run these tests?

303
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:35,883
They want to study the biohazard,
learn how to control it.

304
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:38,803
lnitialize New York sequence.

305
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,347
Activate biohazard.

306
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,978
Stand by. Stand by.

307
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:51,232
New York sequence initialized.

308
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:52,233
The Red Queen.

309
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,609
She's activating...

310
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:55,820
...bioweapons to stop us. Let's go.

311
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,238
Wait.

312
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,406
You hear that?

313
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:09,625
You know what it is?

314
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:11,877
l have an idea.

315
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,314
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.

316
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:06,742
Hey, boys.

317
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:10,371
Bad idea.

318
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,517
Let's move.

319
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:34,311
We're behind schedule.

320
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,826
What's going on?

321
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:51,203
lt's the end of the sequence.

322
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:53,497
They rarely last more than an hour.

323
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:54,957
Come on.

324
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:58,877
Before the Red Queen
activates something else.

325
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:02,089
Targets survived.

326
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:05,134
Security Chief Valentine to intercept.

327
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:08,762
lntruders entering
Moscow test environment.

328
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:11,682
Activate Las Plagas Undead.

329
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:23,444
What's going on?

330
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:27,114
The Red Queen knows we're here.
Keep your eyes open.

331
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:30,868
Stand by. Stand by.

332
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:33,203
Moscow sequence initialized.

333
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,085
-What?
-Listen.

334
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:46,884
Right there.

335
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,020
What the hell are those things?

336
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:05,486
Fall back.

337
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:29,843
Clouds.

338
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:32,179
They're not real.

339
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:34,640
lt's a holographic projection.

340
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,643
When they were running
a simulation...

341
00:40:37,811 --> 00:40:41,146
...trust me,
no one was looking at the sky.

342
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,404
This is the rendezvous point.

343
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:51,740
The strike team is late.

344
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:53,367
Where are they?

345
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,871
There's movement
in the house behind you.

346
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,915
Upstairs window.

347
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:26,108
Why would they be in here?

348
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,951
They're using clones of me.

349
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:37,703
Of course.

350
00:41:37,871 --> 00:41:39,830
You were one of the 50 basic models.

351
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,334
"Basic models."

352
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:48,172
How do you think Umbrella
populates these test scenarios?

353
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,340
Hundreds of people dead each time...

354
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,717
...they run a simulation.

355
00:41:51,885 --> 00:41:54,970
Umbrella imprints them
with basic memories...

356
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:58,140
...just enough to ensure
a correct emotional response...

357
00:41:58,308 --> 00:42:00,142
...to the threat of the biohazard.

358
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:02,019
ln one life, she could be...

359
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:03,395
...a suburban housewife.

360
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:05,939
The next, a businesswoman
in New York.

361
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:09,484
The next,
a soldier working for Umbrella.

362
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:30,148
Mommy.

363
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:31,817
l hid...

364
00:43:31,985 --> 00:43:33,277
...like you told me.

365
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,116
What happened to your clothes...

366
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:40,659
...and your hair?

367
00:44:25,747 --> 00:44:27,080
RPG! Down!

368
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:33,420
We're running out of time!

369
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:36,048
You have to find us a way out now!

370
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:38,258
Almost there!

371
00:44:56,986 --> 00:44:58,487
None of this is real.

372
00:44:58,988 --> 00:45:00,822
-lt is to her.
-l know.

373
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:02,115
That's the point.

374
00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:06,119
All these feelings she has for you,
they were imprinted.

375
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:08,663
A day ago...

376
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:10,624
...she was a blank slate.

377
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:14,086
l could show you a dozen
just like her in cold storage.

378
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,048
l'm sorry, but it's true.

379
00:45:18,508 --> 00:45:19,508
Ready.

380
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:21,760
l was fast, wasn't l?

381
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:23,929
Yes, you were.

382
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,876
-Daddy?
-He's not your father.

383
00:45:55,044 --> 00:45:56,628
Capture if possible.

384
00:45:56,796 --> 00:45:58,755
Terminate if necessary.

385
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:02,259
There's a child here.

386
00:46:02,427 --> 00:46:04,678
Your problem, not ours.

387
00:46:04,846 --> 00:46:08,014
All heart. You haven't changed a bit.

388
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:10,225
l don't know you, lady.

389
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:11,560
Now...

390
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:14,438
...surrender or die.

391
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:27,993
Stay down!

392
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,039
Advance in teams!

393
00:47:14,207 --> 00:47:15,373
Yes, ma'am!

394
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:23,048
You can't...

395
00:47:23,216 --> 00:47:24,174
...stay here!

396
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,551
This will show you the way out.

397
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:28,553
Go through Moscow to the...

398
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:29,471
...submarine pens.

399
00:47:30,223 --> 00:47:30,931
Take this.

400
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,099
The less l have...

401
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:34,726
...with me, the better.

402
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,687
Alpha Team forward!

403
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:01,628
They're coming. Hurry.

404
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:03,046
Go.

405
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:53,805
l've got it!

406
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:54,723
This way!

407
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,399
Hey.

408
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:05,942
Wait.

409
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:07,569
She helped us. Remember?

410
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:09,946
You two made it!

411
00:49:12,742 --> 00:49:13,950
Thought l was the only one...

412
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:14,868
...that survived.

413
00:49:15,036 --> 00:49:17,954
What is this place,
and why is everything in Russian?

414
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:20,624
And what's with the S & M getup?

415
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:22,250
You know how...

416
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:23,752
...to use this?

417
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:25,503
l campaigned for gun control.

418
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:30,717
No, l don't think you understand.
l marched against the NRA.

419
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:32,427
Concentrate.

420
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:34,888
lt's just like a camera.

421
00:49:35,056 --> 00:49:37,807
Point and shoot.

422
00:49:41,437 --> 00:49:44,856
Congratulations.
You're officially a badass.

423
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:49,319
What the hell's going on here?

424
00:49:49,862 --> 00:49:51,363
l'll explain when l get back.

425
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:52,864
You have to keep her safe.

426
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:55,867
-You stay with her.
-You're going?

427
00:49:56,035 --> 00:49:57,702
You said you wouldn't leave.

428
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:00,372
Trust me, okay? What l say is true.

429
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:01,581
l'll come back for you.

430
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:03,041
You promise?

431
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:04,834
Trust me.

432
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,424
l love you.

433
00:50:14,178 --> 00:50:14,886
Come on.

434
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,472
She'll be back for you.

435
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,140
Gotta find a hiding place.

436
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,935
-l met your sister.
-What?

437
00:50:22,103 --> 00:50:24,437
She's not very nice.

438
00:50:25,606 --> 00:50:27,357
Let's try hiding down here.

439
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:40,036
This way.

440
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:41,538
Let's move!

441
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:44,290
We can work our way--

442
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:13,194
Waiting for a written invitation?

443
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:24,831
Sweet ride.

444
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:27,375
Well, this is Moscow.

445
00:51:27,668 --> 00:51:29,669
Heard gunfire.
Thought you might need...

446
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:31,713
-...some help.
-Where's Ada?

447
00:51:31,881 --> 00:51:33,089
l don't think she made it.

448
00:51:34,717 --> 00:51:36,634
-l'm sorry.
-You saw...

449
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:37,719
...her die?

450
00:51:38,137 --> 00:51:38,928
No.

451
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:40,305
She always...

452
00:51:40,473 --> 00:51:41,806
...has a plan.

453
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:22,847
Boys, you mind?

454
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:25,433
-Shall we?
-My pleasure.

455
00:52:56,841 --> 00:52:58,967
Let me know when you plan
on doing that again.

456
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:06,057
Heads up.

457
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:44,762
Our little friend is back!

458
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:46,222
Oh, shit.

459
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:52,395
-Almost there.
-No.

460
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:54,314
Wait. You're not going down there!

461
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:37,565
Everyone okay?

462
00:54:39,735 --> 00:54:40,485
Yeah.

463
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:41,986
All right, let's go.

464
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:45,907
Hello?

465
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:48,409
You can come out.

466
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:50,662
l'm back.

467
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,044
Where'd you find these guys?

468
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:01,005
Who's this?

469
00:55:01,465 --> 00:55:02,674
l'm Becky.

470
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,509
Hi, Becky.

471
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:06,177
This is my mom.

472
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:08,012
Your mom?

473
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:10,807
Long story.

474
00:55:12,643 --> 00:55:13,601
Twenty-two minutes left.

475
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:16,771
There's no going back
the way we came.

476
00:55:16,939 --> 00:55:18,314
We lost our map with Sergei.

477
00:55:18,607 --> 00:55:19,565
l'm on it.

478
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:34,288
We can take this tunnel.

479
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:37,500
There's a service shaft
that leads down to the submarine pens.

480
00:55:38,127 --> 00:55:39,377
Let's go.

481
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:06,904
How'd you end up
working for Wesker?

482
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:08,656
l don't work for him...

483
00:56:08,824 --> 00:56:10,742
...but things on the surface
have changed.

484
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:13,327
Wesker said you knew
of some weapon...

485
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:15,329
...something that could turn the tide...

486
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:16,581
...for us.

487
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,207
But l don't think...

488
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,626
...l would have risked
so much for one person.

489
00:56:22,296 --> 00:56:23,921
You're probably right.

490
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,381
This way.

491
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:27,341
The submarine pens...

492
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:28,634
...are up above us.

493
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:30,928
Come on. Move.

494
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:53,326
The elevator platforms are up ahead.

495
00:56:53,494 --> 00:56:54,160
Eleven minutes.

496
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:57,371
-We're gonna be okay.
-Hold on.

497
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:02,126
Eleven minutes.
We're gonna be okay.

498
00:57:02,294 --> 00:57:05,129
-Hold on.
-Accessing power grid.

499
00:57:05,297 --> 00:57:07,256
Dispatching biohazard.

500
00:57:12,888 --> 00:57:14,472
Everybody get onboard.

501
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,645
Hold on. Next stop...

502
00:57:20,813 --> 00:57:23,231
...menswear and sporting goods.

503
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:30,947
Move down!

504
00:57:32,658 --> 00:57:34,700
-Barry, what is it?
-l don't know.

505
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:36,410
Where are you going?

506
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:38,454
Somebody must've
cut the power remotely.

507
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,417
Be strong.

508
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:44,919
l'm gonna keep you safe.

509
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:56,305
Can you get it online?

510
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:57,348
Not without...

511
00:57:57,516 --> 00:57:58,432
...the access codes.

512
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:04,397
Nine minutes.
Looks like we're going with plan B.

513
00:58:05,357 --> 00:58:06,524
What?

514
00:58:06,692 --> 00:58:08,860
There's a reason
we planted those explosives.

515
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:19,495
No!

516
00:58:24,877 --> 00:58:29,839
Mommy!

517
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:37,013
l feel like shit.

518
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,102
She's dead.

519
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:54,280
-What are you doing?
-She's alive.

520
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:55,656
l'm going to get her.

521
00:58:55,824 --> 00:58:57,116
l didn't lose friends so...

522
00:58:57,284 --> 00:58:58,075
...you could...

523
00:58:58,243 --> 00:58:59,452
-...walk away.
-l plan...

524
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:00,536
...on coming back.

525
00:59:01,747 --> 00:59:03,080
Don't do this.

526
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:04,165
You're more important...

527
00:59:04,333 --> 00:59:05,166
...than she is.

528
00:59:05,334 --> 00:59:07,251
That's where you're wrong.

529
00:59:07,419 --> 00:59:08,836
This is a mistake.

530
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:11,005
Get out of my way.

531
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:22,099
Don't leave without me, okay?

532
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:24,352
Are you kidding me?
l'm going with you.

533
00:59:31,902 --> 00:59:33,569
Don't move. Don't move.

534
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:34,737
lt's okay.

535
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:36,364
Go get her back.

536
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:07,061
You like that?

537
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:45,618
Move up!

538
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:55,461
Fall back to the elevator!

539
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:57,380
You go!

540
01:01:58,673 --> 01:01:59,924
l'm gonna stay a while.

541
01:02:00,092 --> 01:02:01,509
Barry.

542
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:04,011
When the countdown
gets down to zero...

543
01:02:04,179 --> 01:02:06,097
...you have to be on that elevator!

544
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:07,431
Someone's got to stay.

545
01:02:09,017 --> 01:02:09,892
Besides...

546
01:02:13,313 --> 01:02:15,314
...l'm kind of enjoying myself!

547
01:02:19,528 --> 01:02:21,987
Go. Go!

548
01:02:22,823 --> 01:02:24,573
Come on!

549
01:03:49,618 --> 01:03:51,368
Oh, Becky. Becky.

550
01:04:07,052 --> 01:04:07,718
Go!

551
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:34,995
Bring out the prisoner!

552
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:45,548
Cease your firing.

553
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:48,008
Or l'll execute her.

554
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:50,970
Now...

555
01:04:52,097 --> 01:04:53,973
...throw down your guns...

556
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:55,224
...and step out.

557
01:04:55,976 --> 01:04:56,642
Step out...

558
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:58,394
...or she dies!

559
01:06:19,184 --> 01:06:20,225
Mommy, who are they?

560
01:06:25,774 --> 01:06:26,523
Who are they?

561
01:06:31,196 --> 01:06:32,071
Mommy, is that you?

562
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:48,295
You're my mommy, aren't you?

563
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:50,130
l am now.

564
01:07:56,656 --> 01:07:57,489
Move!

565
01:09:02,764 --> 01:09:04,223
Choppers are on their way...

566
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:07,017
...so just sit back and relax.

567
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:41,677
What's going on?

568
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:53,313
What the hell is that?

569
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:05,534
Becky, are you hurt?

570
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:07,160
No. l'm okay.

571
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:27,491
Told you she'd have a plan.

572
01:11:32,872 --> 01:11:34,498
Only the two of you?

573
01:11:34,666 --> 01:11:36,416
lt'll be enough.

574
01:11:41,255 --> 01:11:43,256
The Las Plagas parasite.

575
01:16:40,888 --> 01:16:42,639
Terminate Project Alice.

576
01:19:13,874 --> 01:19:14,374
Alice!

577
01:19:30,141 --> 01:19:32,767
You can't kill me.

578
01:19:32,935 --> 01:19:34,519
l don't need to.

579
01:20:19,482 --> 01:20:21,024
l'm coming for you!

580
01:20:21,775 --> 01:20:23,151
Good luck with that.

581
01:20:49,970 --> 01:20:50,678
Leon.

582
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:05,360
What is it?

583
01:21:05,528 --> 01:21:06,611
lt's help.

584
01:22:15,264 --> 01:22:20,935
Glad to have you back.

585
01:22:55,304 --> 01:22:56,804
l don't care.

586
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:27,627
Wesker.

587
01:23:29,171 --> 01:23:31,422
l see you've made yourself at home.

588
01:23:32,758 --> 01:23:34,342
Well, l must say...

589
01:23:35,094 --> 01:23:37,845
...it does have a certain ease to it.

590
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:56,072
What is this?
What have you done...

591
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:57,281
...to me?

592
01:23:59,576 --> 01:24:00,743
You were the only one...

593
01:24:00,911 --> 01:24:03,955
...to successfully bond
with the T-Virus...

594
01:24:04,748 --> 01:24:07,166
...to fully realize her powers.

595
01:24:07,918 --> 01:24:09,585
Well, now l have need of you.

596
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:11,587
The old you.

597
01:24:12,131 --> 01:24:14,716
So l've given you back your gift.

598
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:16,467
You are...

599
01:24:16,635 --> 01:24:18,136
...the weapon.

600
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,227
l'm gonna kill you.

601
01:24:27,146 --> 01:24:28,354
Perhaps.

602
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:32,108
But first, you have work to do.

603
01:24:35,237 --> 01:24:39,407
The Red Queen is determined
to destroy all life on earth.

604
01:24:39,575 --> 01:24:43,369
This is the last that remain of us,
of the human race.

605
01:24:45,539 --> 01:24:48,207
lt seems we're bonded
against a common foe.

606
01:24:48,375 --> 01:24:52,211
This is why we needed you back.
The ultimate weapon.

607
01:24:57,718 --> 01:25:00,678
This is humanity's last stand.

608
01:25:00,846 --> 01:25:03,431
The beginning of the end.

609
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:14,358
Close the gap! Close the gap!
Keep that perimeter closed!
