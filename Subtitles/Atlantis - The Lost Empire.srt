1
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:12,574
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:38,239
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

3
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:42,202
First off, I'd like to thank this board for
taking the time to hear my proposal.

4
00:02:42,244 --> 00:02:44,746
Now, we've all heard
of the legend of Atlantis,

5
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,915
a continent somewhere
in the mid-Atlantic

6
00:02:46,957 --> 00:02:48,792
that was home
to an advanced civilization,

7
00:02:48,876 --> 00:02:51,211
possessing technology
far beyond our own,

8
00:02:51,587 --> 00:02:53,505
that, according to our friend Plato here,

9
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:56,091
was suddenly struck
by some cataclysmic event

10
00:02:56,133 --> 00:02:57,717
that sank it beneath the sea.

11
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,512
Now, some of you may ask,
why Atlantis?

12
00:03:00,596 --> 00:03:02,430
It's just a myth, isn't it?

13
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:03,640
Pure fantasy.

14
00:03:03,724 --> 00:03:06,768
Well, that is where you'd be wrong.

15
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:10,105
10,000 years
before the Egyptians built the pyramids,

16
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:13,274
Atlantis had electricity,
advanced medicine,

17
00:03:13,317 --> 00:03:15,360
even the power of flight.
Impossible, you say?

18
00:03:15,444 --> 00:03:17,195
Well, no. No, not for them.

19
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:19,280
Numerous ancient cultures
all over the globe agree

20
00:03:19,323 --> 00:03:22,117
that Atlantis possessed
a power source of some kind

21
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:24,494
more powerful than steam, than coal.

22
00:03:24,578 --> 00:03:27,122
More powerful than our modern
internal combustion engines.

23
00:03:27,623 --> 00:03:31,042
Gentlemen, I propose
that we find Atlantis,

24
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,794
find that power source,

25
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:34,879
and bring it back to the surface.

26
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,966
Now, this is a page
from an illuminated text

27
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,136
that describes a book called
The Shepherd's Journal,

28
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:44,139
said to have been
a firsthand account of Atlantis

29
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:45,640
and its exact whereabouts.

30
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:48,893
Now, based on a centuries-old
translation of a Norse text,

31
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:51,479
historians have believed
the Journal resides in Ireland.

32
00:03:51,647 --> 00:03:54,441
But after comparing the text

33
00:03:54,483 --> 00:03:57,444
to the runes on this Viking shield,

34
00:03:57,486 --> 00:04:01,573
I found that one of the letters
had been mistranslated.

35
00:04:01,657 --> 00:04:03,908
So, by changing this letter

36
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,035
and inserting the correct one,

37
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,955
we find that The Shepherd's Journal,
the key to Atlantis,

38
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:12,375
lies not in Ireland, gentlemen,

39
00:04:13,335 --> 00:04:15,003
but in Iceland.

40
00:04:16,672 --> 00:04:18,047
Pause for effect.

41
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:21,593
Gentlemen, I'll take your questions now.

42
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:26,639
Would you gentlemen
please excuse me for a moment?

43
00:04:28,684 --> 00:04:31,478
Cartography and Linguistics,
Milo Thatch speaking.

44
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,482
Yeah. Just a second.

45
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,199
Pardon me, Mr. Hickenbottom.

46
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,080
How's that? Is that better?

47
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,500
Yeah. You're welcome.

48
00:04:53,542 --> 00:04:55,877
- And don't let it happen again.
- All right, bye.

49
00:04:56,545 --> 00:04:58,880
Now, as you can see by the...

50
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:01,216
By this map...

51
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,009
Map that...

52
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:05,261
That I've drawn, I plotted the route

53
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:06,721
that will take myself and a crew

54
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:09,005
to the southern coast of Iceland
to retrieve the Journal.

55
00:05:10,017 --> 00:05:11,726
Showtime.

56
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,604
Well, this is it.

57
00:05:14,688 --> 00:05:16,773
I am finally getting out of the dungeon.

58
00:05:52,768 --> 00:05:54,561
"Dear Mr. Thatch, this is to inform you"

59
00:05:54,603 --> 00:05:58,106
"that your meeting today has been
moved up from 4:30 p.m. To 3:30 p.m."

60
00:05:59,316 --> 00:06:00,567
What?

61
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,631
"Dear Mr. Thatch, due to your absence,"

62
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,238
"the board has voted
to reject your proposal."

63
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,574
"Have a nice weekend.
Mr. Harcourt's office."

64
00:06:07,741 --> 00:06:09,742
They can't do this to me!

65
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:13,454
I swear, that young Thatch
gets crazier every year.

66
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,957
If I ever hear the word "Atlantis" again,

67
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,959
I'll step in front of a bus.

68
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,419
I'll push you.

69
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:21,129
- Mr. Harcourt!
- Good Lord!

70
00:06:21,213 --> 00:06:23,298
- There he is!
- Members of the board... Wait.

71
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:25,967
- How did you find us?
- Mr. Harcourt, wait!

72
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,010
Head for the hills!

73
00:06:27,094 --> 00:06:28,177
Where is a guard when you need him?

74
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,972
Mr. Harcourt, you gotta listen to me, sir!

75
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,308
Sir?

76
00:06:36,353 --> 00:06:38,229
Wait! Mr. Harcourt!

77
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,983
Sir, I have new evidence that...
Please, Mr. Harcourt!

78
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:44,485
Stop! Sir, if you... Could you hold...

79
00:06:44,528 --> 00:06:46,154
Thank you very much. Look at...

80
00:06:46,196 --> 00:06:48,656
This museum funds
scientific expeditions

81
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:52,160
based on facts,
not legends and folklore.

82
00:06:52,244 --> 00:06:54,329
Besides, we need you here.

83
00:06:54,371 --> 00:06:56,623
- We depend on you.
- You do?

84
00:06:56,665 --> 00:06:58,374
Yes. What with winter coming,

85
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,168
that boiler's going to need
a lot of attention.

86
00:07:00,252 --> 00:07:01,544
- Boiler?
- Onward, Heinz!

87
00:07:03,088 --> 00:07:04,714
But there... There's a journal!

88
00:07:04,798 --> 00:07:07,508
It's in Iceland! I'm sure of it this time!

89
00:07:09,678 --> 00:07:12,305
Sir, I really hoped
it wouldn't come to this,

90
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:16,684
but this is a letter of resignation.

91
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,937
If you reject my proposal, I'll...

92
00:07:21,148 --> 00:07:23,149
I'll quit!

93
00:07:27,571 --> 00:07:28,696
I mean it, sir.

94
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,698
If you refuse to fund my proposal...

95
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:31,824
You'll what?

96
00:07:31,867 --> 00:07:33,534
Flush your career down the toilet,

97
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,827
just like your grandfather?

98
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,829
You have a lot of potential, Milo.

99
00:07:36,872 --> 00:07:39,374
Don't throw it all away
chasing fairy tales.

100
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,876
But I can prove Atlantis exists!

101
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,544
You want to go on an expedition?

102
00:07:43,587 --> 00:07:46,422
Here. Take a trolley
to the Potomac and jump in!

103
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,550
Maybe the cold water will
clear your head. Heinz!

104
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,977
I'm home.

105
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,562
Fluffy? Here, kitty.

106
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:06,776
Milo James Thatch?

107
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:10,363
Who... Who are you?
How did you get in here?

108
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:14,617
I came down the chimney.

109
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,619
My name is Helga Sinclair.

110
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,746
I'm acting on behalf of my employer,

111
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:22,041
who has a most intriguing
proposition for you.

112
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,793
Are you interested?

113
00:08:24,294 --> 00:08:26,087
Your employer?

114
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,255
Who is your employer?

115
00:08:43,939 --> 00:08:45,189
This way, please.

116
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:47,400
And don't drip on the Caravaggio.

117
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:49,110
Step lively.

118
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,779
Mr. Whitmore does not like
to be kept waiting.

119
00:08:52,948 --> 00:08:55,324
You will address him
as "Mr. Whitmore" or "sir."

120
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,118
You will stand unless
asked to be seated.

121
00:08:57,202 --> 00:08:58,882
Keep your sentences short
and to the point.

122
00:08:58,954 --> 00:09:00,455
Are we clear?

123
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,709
And relax.

124
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,336
He doesn't bite... often.

125
00:09:14,636 --> 00:09:15,803
Grandpa?

126
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,805
Finest explorer I ever met.

127
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:20,641
Preston Whitmore.
Pleasure to meet you, Milo.

128
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,478
Join me in a little yoga?

129
00:09:23,562 --> 00:09:25,396
No, no. Thank you.

130
00:09:25,647 --> 00:09:26,856
Did you really know my grandfather?

131
00:09:26,982 --> 00:09:29,984
Oh, yeah. Met old Thaddeus
back in Georgetown.

132
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:33,321
Class of '66. We stayed close friends
till the end of his days.

133
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,448
Even dragged me along

134
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,241
on some of his danged fool expeditions.

135
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,869
Thatch was crazy as a fruit bat, he was.

136
00:09:39,953 --> 00:09:40,995
He spoke of you often.

137
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,164
Funny. He never mentioned you.

138
00:09:43,248 --> 00:09:45,500
He wouldn't.
He knew how much I like my privacy.

139
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:48,878
I keep a low profile.

140
00:09:48,962 --> 00:09:50,797
Mr. Whitmore, should I be
wondering why I'm here?

141
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:51,881
Look on that table.

142
00:09:54,843 --> 00:09:55,885
It's for you.

143
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:59,097
It's from my grandfather.

144
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:01,140
He brought that package
to me years ago.

145
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,683
He said if anything
were to happen to him,

146
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,519
I should give it to you
when you were ready.

147
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,437
Whatever that means.

148
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:08,898
It...

149
00:10:09,441 --> 00:10:10,525
It can't be.

150
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,110
It's The Shepherd's Journal.

151
00:10:12,402 --> 00:10:15,196
Mr. Whitmore, this journal is the key

152
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,406
to finding the lost continent of Atlantis!

153
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,325
Atlantis.

154
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,535
I wasn't born yesterday, son.

155
00:10:20,619 --> 00:10:21,994
No, no, no. Look. Look at this.

156
00:10:22,037 --> 00:10:24,372
Coordinates. Clues. It's all right here.

157
00:10:24,414 --> 00:10:26,040
Yeah, looks like gibberish to me.

158
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,918
That's because it's been written
in a dialect that no longer exists.

159
00:10:29,002 --> 00:10:31,337
- So it's useless.
- No, no, just difficult.

160
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,381
I've spent my whole life
studying dead languages.

161
00:10:33,465 --> 00:10:34,715
It's not gibberish to me.

162
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,509
It's probably a fake.

163
00:10:37,761 --> 00:10:39,521
Mr. Whitmore,
my grandfather would have known

164
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,722
if this were a fake. I would know.

165
00:10:41,765 --> 00:10:44,809
I will stake everything I own,
everything that I believe in,

166
00:10:44,893 --> 00:10:46,978
that this is
the genuine Shepherd's Journal.

167
00:10:47,062 --> 00:10:49,063
All right, all right.
So, what do you want to do with it?

168
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,648
Well, I'll get funding.

169
00:10:50,732 --> 00:10:53,234
- I mean, I'll... The museum...
- They'll never believe you.

170
00:10:53,318 --> 00:10:56,070
I'll show them! I will make them believe.

171
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,196
Like you did today?

172
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,740
Yes! Well, no. How did you...

173
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,492
Forget about them, okay? Never mind!

174
00:11:01,618 --> 00:11:03,369
I will find Atlantis on my own.

175
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,121
I mean, if I have to rent a rowboat!

176
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,790
Congratulations, Milo.

177
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,585
This is exactly what I wanted to hear.

178
00:11:10,627 --> 00:11:12,170
But forget the rowboat, son.

179
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,382
We'll travel in style.

180
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,596
It's all been arranged,
the whole ball of wax.

181
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,805
Why?

182
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,640
For years, your granddad bent my ear

183
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,184
with stories about that old book.

184
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,476
I didn't buy it for a minute.

185
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:30,062
So, finally, I got fed up
and I made a bet with the old coot.

186
00:11:30,105 --> 00:11:33,107
I said, "Thatch, if you ever
actually find that so-called journal",

187
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,790
"not only will I finance the expedition,"

188
00:11:34,818 --> 00:11:36,527
"but I'll kiss you full on the mouth."

189
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,946
Imagine my embarrassment
when he found the darn thing.

190
00:11:39,823 --> 00:11:41,782
Now, I know
your grandfather's gone, Milo,

191
00:11:41,825 --> 00:11:43,075
God rest his soul,

192
00:11:43,118 --> 00:11:45,203
but Preston Whitmore
is a man who keeps his word.

193
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,329
You hear that, Thatch?

194
00:11:46,413 --> 00:11:49,957
I'm going to the afterlife
with a clear conscience, by thunder!

195
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,675
Your grandpa was a great man.

196
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,886
You probably don't realize how great.

197
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:05,473
Those buffoons at the museum
dragged him down,

198
00:12:05,557 --> 00:12:07,141
made a laughing stock of him.

199
00:12:08,143 --> 00:12:09,810
He died a broken man.

200
00:12:10,145 --> 00:12:13,648
If I could bring back
just one shred of proof,

201
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:14,941
that'd be enough for me.

202
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:17,818
Thatch.

203
00:12:18,987 --> 00:12:21,322
What are we standing around for?
We got work to do.

204
00:12:21,406 --> 00:12:22,907
But, Mr. Whitmore,
you know, in order to do

205
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:24,575
what you're proposing,
you're gonna need a crew.

206
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,660
Taken care of.

207
00:12:25,702 --> 00:12:27,620
You'll need engineers and geologists.

208
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:29,622
Got 'em all. The best of the best.

209
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:32,124
Gaetan Moliere,
geology and excavation.

210
00:12:32,167 --> 00:12:33,668
The man has a nose for dirt.

211
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:35,586
Vincenzo Santorini, demolitions.

212
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,546
Busted him out of a Turkish prison.

213
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:39,548
Audrey Ramirez.
Don't let her age fool you.

214
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:42,260
She's forgotten more about engines
than you and I will ever know.

215
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,053
They're the same crew that
brought the Journal back.

216
00:12:44,137 --> 00:12:46,681
- Where was it?
- Iceland.

217
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,724
I knew it! I knew it!

218
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:51,811
All we need now is
an expert in gibberish.

219
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,854
So, it's decision time.

220
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,023
You can build on
the foundation your grandfather left you

221
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,858
or you can go back to your boiler room.

222
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,197
- This is for real.
- Now you're catching on.

223
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,242
All right. Okay. I'll have to quit my job.

224
00:13:06,326 --> 00:13:07,910
It's done. You resigned this afternoon.

225
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,836
- I did?
- Yep. Don't like to leave loose ends.

226
00:13:09,871 --> 00:13:11,591
My apartment.
I'm gonna have to give notice.

227
00:13:11,623 --> 00:13:13,124
- Taken care of.
- My clothes?

228
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:14,375
- Packed.
- My books?

229
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:15,918
- In storage.
- My cat?

230
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:18,879
My gosh.

231
00:13:19,214 --> 00:13:21,007
Your granddad had a saying.

232
00:13:21,049 --> 00:13:24,385
"Our lives are remembered,
by the gifts we leave our children."

233
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,722
This journal is his gift to you, Milo.

234
00:13:29,182 --> 00:13:30,933
Atlantis is waiting.

235
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:32,810
What do you say?

236
00:13:32,894 --> 00:13:34,770
I'm your man, Mr. Whitmore.

237
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,272
You will not regret this.

238
00:13:36,523 --> 00:13:37,690
Boy, I am so excited,

239
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,900
I can't even hold it in.

240
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,577
Carrots. Why is there always carrots?

241
00:13:49,619 --> 00:13:51,329
I didn't even eat carrots.

242
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:54,248
Attention. All hands to the launch bay.

243
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,084
To whoever took the "L"
from the Motor Pool sign,

244
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,503
we are all very amused.

245
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,923
Excuse me? I need to report in?

246
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,258
Yes, Mr. Thatch?

247
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,843
It's you!

248
00:14:05,927 --> 00:14:07,762
Blondie, I got a bone to pick with you.

249
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:08,888
Hold that thought.

250
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,473
What is it this time, Cookie?

251
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:14,101
You done stuffed my wagon full to
busting with non-essentials.

252
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,603
Look at all this.

253
00:14:15,645 --> 00:14:18,606
Cinnamon, oregano, cilantro.

254
00:14:18,648 --> 00:14:21,067
What in the cockadoodle is cilantro?

255
00:14:21,109 --> 00:14:23,235
And what is this?

256
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:24,362
That would be lettuce.

257
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,530
Lettuce? Lettuce?

258
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:28,240
It's a vegetable, Cookie.

259
00:14:28,283 --> 00:14:30,284
The men need
the four basic food groups.

260
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,453
I got your four basic food groups!

261
00:14:32,537 --> 00:14:34,330
Beans, bacon, whiskey, and lard!

262
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,833
All right, cowboy.
Pack it up and move it out.

263
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:41,295
Attention. All hands to the launch bay.

264
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,672
Final loading in progress.

265
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,600
Hey, Junior.

266
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:57,520
If you're looking for the pony rides,
they're back there.

267
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,647
Excuse me. Excuse me?

268
00:14:59,689 --> 00:15:02,066
You dropped your dynamite.

269
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,653
What else have you got in there?

270
00:15:05,695 --> 00:15:10,825
Gunpowder,
nitroglycerin, notepads,

271
00:15:10,867 --> 00:15:13,994
fuses, wicks, glue, and...

272
00:15:14,037 --> 00:15:15,830
Paper clips. Big ones.

273
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:18,416
You know, just office supplies.

274
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,126
Milo! Where you been?

275
00:15:20,168 --> 00:15:21,419
I want you to meet Commander Rourke.

276
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,623
He led the Iceland team
that brought the Journal back.

277
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,131
Milo Thatch.

278
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,883
Pleasure to meet the grandson
of old Thaddeus.

279
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,885
I see you got that journal. Nice pictures,

280
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,430
but I prefer a good western myself.

281
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:33,681
Pretty impressive?

282
00:15:33,765 --> 00:15:37,143
Boy, when you settle a bet,
you settle a bet.

283
00:15:37,185 --> 00:15:38,769
Well, your granddad always believed

284
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:41,105
you couldn't put a price
on the pursuit of knowledge.

285
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:43,691
Well, believe me,
this'll be small change

286
00:15:43,775 --> 00:15:45,860
compared to the value
of what we're gonna learn on this trip.

287
00:15:45,944 --> 00:15:48,320
Yes, this should be
enriching for all of us.

288
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,239
Attention, all personnel.

289
00:15:50,365 --> 00:15:53,033
Launch will commence in 15 minutes.

290
00:15:53,076 --> 00:15:54,326
- Mr. Whitmore.
- Rourke.

291
00:15:54,369 --> 00:15:55,369
It's time.

292
00:15:55,495 --> 00:15:57,997
- Bye, Mr. Whitmore!
- Make us proud, boy!

293
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,040
Rig ship for dive!

294
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,459
Aye, sir! Rig ship for dive.

295
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,085
Lieutenant, take her down.

296
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,795
Diving officer, submerge the ship.

297
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,714
- Aye!
- Make the depth one-five-zero feet.

298
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:08,716
Make the depth one-five-zero feet.

299
00:16:08,758 --> 00:16:11,051
Dive, dive! Five degrees down bubble.

300
00:16:11,094 --> 00:16:12,928
- Take us down.
- Take us down!

301
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,305
Attention.

302
00:16:56,431 --> 00:16:58,766
Tonight's supper will be baked beans.

303
00:16:58,808 --> 00:17:00,518
Musical program to follow.

304
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:02,978
Who wrote this?

305
00:17:09,736 --> 00:17:13,030
You have disturbed the dirt.

306
00:17:13,114 --> 00:17:15,449
- Pardon me?
- You have disturbed the dirt!

307
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,743
Dirt from around the globe,
spanning the centuries!

308
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:19,119
What have you done?

309
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,539
England must never merge with France!

310
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,791
- What's it doing in my bed?
- You ask too many questions.

311
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,275
Who are you? Who sent you?
Speak up!

312
00:17:25,293 --> 00:17:27,795
- Me? I'm...
- I will know soon enough.

313
00:17:27,879 --> 00:17:29,213
Hey, hey, hey! Let go!

314
00:17:29,297 --> 00:17:31,090
Do not be such a crybaby. Hold still.

315
00:17:31,132 --> 00:17:32,967
There you are.

316
00:17:33,009 --> 00:17:36,136
Now, tell me your story, my little friend.

317
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,514
Parchment fiber from
the Nile delta circa 500 B.C.

318
00:17:38,598 --> 00:17:39,640
Lead pencil, number 2.

319
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,141
Paint flecks of a type
used in government buildings.

320
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,726
You have a cat,
shorthaired Persian, two years old,

321
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:43,978
third in a litter of seven.

322
00:17:44,479 --> 00:17:47,982
There are all the microscopic
fingerprints of the mapmaker.

323
00:17:49,317 --> 00:17:50,985
And linguist.

324
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:53,112
- Hey, how did you...
- This is an outrage!

325
00:17:53,154 --> 00:17:55,364
You must leave at once!
Out, out, out, out, out!

326
00:17:56,324 --> 00:17:57,908
Sat in the dirt, didn't you?

327
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,827
Moliere, now what have I told you

328
00:17:59,869 --> 00:18:01,245
about playing nice with the other kids?

329
00:18:01,329 --> 00:18:03,789
Get back. I've got soap,
and I'm not afraid to use it.

330
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,126
Back, foul creature!
Back to the pit from which you came!

331
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:09,545
The name's Sweet.

332
00:18:09,629 --> 00:18:11,213
Joshua Sweet. Medical officer.

333
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,506
Yeah, Milo Thatch.

334
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,466
Milo Thatch. You're my 3:00.

335
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:16,010
Well, no time like the present.

336
00:18:16,177 --> 00:18:17,469
- Oh, boy.
- Nice, isn't it?

337
00:18:17,512 --> 00:18:19,013
The catalog says that this little beauty

338
00:18:19,097 --> 00:18:20,681
can saw through a femur in 28 seconds.

339
00:18:20,765 --> 00:18:22,308
I'm betting I can cut that time in half.

340
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,851
Now, stick out your
tongue and say, "Ah."

341
00:18:23,893 --> 00:18:25,352
Oh, no, really. I have a...

342
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,520
So, where you from?

343
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:27,938
Really? I have family up that way.

344
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,983
Beautiful country up there.
Do you do any fishing?

345
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,901
Me? I hate fishing. I hate fish.

346
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:35,466
Hate the taste, hate the smell,
and hate all them little bones.

347
00:18:35,488 --> 00:18:37,448
Here, I'm gonna need you
to fill these up.

348
00:18:37,532 --> 00:18:38,866
With what?

349
00:18:38,908 --> 00:18:41,535
Will Milo Thatch
please report to the bridge?

350
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,661
Thank you.

351
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,413
I mean, nice meeting you.

352
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,374
Nice meeting you, too.

353
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,797
So I says to him,
"What's wrong with my meatloaf?"

354
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,257
And he says to me...

355
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:58,385
Hold on a second, Margie,
I got another call.

356
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:00,721
Sir, we're approaching coordinates.

357
00:19:00,805 --> 00:19:02,723
Hello, Margie?
Yeah, so anyways, he says...

358
00:19:02,807 --> 00:19:04,516
All right, let's have a look around.

359
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,079
Aye, sir. Set course to two-four-zero.

360
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:07,186
Aye, aye, sir.

361
00:19:07,228 --> 00:19:08,479
15 degrees down angle
on the bow planes.

362
00:19:08,563 --> 00:19:10,314
Come right two-four-zero.

363
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,442
Welcome to the bridge, Mr. Thatch.

364
00:19:13,526 --> 00:19:14,693
Okay, everybody,

365
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,236
I want you to give Mr. Thatch

366
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,905
your undivided attention.

367
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:21,241
Good afternoon.
Can everyone hear me okay?

368
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,414
Okay, how about some slides?

369
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,167
The first slide is
a depiction of a creature.

370
00:19:30,251 --> 00:19:31,877
A creature so frightening

371
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,381
that sailors were said
to be driven mad by the mere sight of it.

372
00:19:37,592 --> 00:19:40,052
I'm sorry. That's wrong.

373
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:43,097
Geez, I used to take lunch money
from guys like this.

374
00:19:43,181 --> 00:19:44,598
Anyway, this... Okay.

375
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:47,434
This is an illustration of the Leviathan,

376
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:50,020
the creature guarding
the entrance to Atlantis.

377
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,438
With something like that,

378
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,857
I would have white wine, I think.

379
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,609
It's a mythical sea serpent.

380
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,027
He's described in The Book of Job.

381
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,112
The Bible says,

382
00:19:58,196 --> 00:19:59,676
"Out of his mouth go burning lights,"

383
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,448
"sparks of fire shoot out."

384
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:04,743
But more likely, it's a carving or
a sculpture to frighten the superstitious.

385
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:07,246
So we find this masterpiece.
Then what?

386
00:20:07,288 --> 00:20:08,706
When do we dig?

387
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,124
Actually, we don't have to dig.

388
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,458
You see, according to the Journal,

389
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:13,419
the path to Atlantis
will take us down a tunnel

390
00:20:13,461 --> 00:20:15,796
at the bottom of the ocean,
and we'll come up a curve

391
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,464
into an air pocket right here,

392
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:18,757
where we'll find the remnants

393
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,009
of an ancient highway
that will lead us to Atlantis.

394
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,511
Kind of like the grease trap in your sink.

395
00:20:22,762 --> 00:20:25,097
Cartographer, linguist, plumber.

396
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,515
Hard to believe he's still single.

397
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:29,143
- You said there'd be digging.
- Go away, Mole.

398
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,853
Captain, you'd better
come look at this, sir.

399
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,521
Okay, class dismissed.

400
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,064
Give me exterior lights.

401
00:20:41,948 --> 00:20:43,490
Look at that.

402
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,659
There are ships here from every era.

403
00:21:09,392 --> 00:21:11,935
Commander, I think
you should hear this.

404
00:21:13,396 --> 00:21:15,773
Commander? Commander?

405
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,525
"Enter the lair of the Leviathan."

406
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:19,818
Commander?

407
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,403
"There you will find the path
to the gateway."

408
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:23,864
- Commander?
- Yes, Mrs. Packard. What is it?

409
00:21:23,948 --> 00:21:26,033
I'm picking up something
on the hydrophone.

410
00:21:26,117 --> 00:21:28,243
- I think you should hear.
- Put it on speakers.

411
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,379
What is it? A pod of whales?

412
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,923
Bigger.

413
00:21:41,007 --> 00:21:42,090
It sounds metallic.

414
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,467
Could be an echo off one of the rocks.

415
00:21:43,551 --> 00:21:46,220
Do you want to do my job? Be my guest.

416
00:21:46,262 --> 00:21:48,096
Is it just me, or is that getting louder?

417
00:21:53,394 --> 00:21:55,562
Well, whatever it was, it's gone now.

418
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,314
Helmsman! Bring us about.

419
00:21:57,398 --> 00:21:59,118
Tighten our search pattern
and slow us to...

420
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:03,904
Out of the way!

421
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,206
Tell Cookie to melt the butter
and break out the bibs.

422
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,333
I want this lobster served up
on a silver platter.

423
00:22:16,417 --> 00:22:19,044
Load the torpedo bays!
Sub pod crews, battle stations!

424
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,880
Battle stations!

425
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:24,716
Steady, boys. Don't panic.

426
00:22:30,598 --> 00:22:33,267
Jiminy Christmas! It's a machine!

427
00:22:37,313 --> 00:22:39,106
Wait, wait!

428
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:41,567
Launch subpods!

429
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,068
Subpods away!

430
00:22:48,449 --> 00:22:49,533
Fire!

431
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,163
We're free. All ahead full.

432
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,671
Fire torpedoes!

433
00:23:15,351 --> 00:23:16,518
Get me the bridge!

434
00:23:16,769 --> 00:23:18,645
Sir, it's Engineering on four.

435
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,814
Rourke! We took a big hit down here,

436
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,482
and we're taking on water fast.

437
00:23:22,525 --> 00:23:24,610
I don't want to be around
when it hits the boilers.

438
00:23:24,652 --> 00:23:25,819
How much time do we have?

439
00:23:25,945 --> 00:23:27,487
Twenty minutes, if the bulkhead holds.

440
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,823
You better make that five.

441
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,408
You heard the lady. Let's move!

442
00:23:31,492 --> 00:23:32,993
Move! Where? Move where?

443
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,202
Packard, sound the alarm!

444
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,495
He took his suitcase?

445
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,497
Marge, honey,
I don't think he's coming back.

446
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:39,333
- Packard!
- I have to call you back.

447
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:40,792
No, no, I'll call you.

448
00:23:42,795 --> 00:23:45,339
All hands, abandon ship.

449
00:23:45,506 --> 00:23:47,883
Move it, people!
Sometime today would be nice!

450
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,969
Come on! Everybody
grab a seat and buckle in.

451
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,888
Lieutenant, get us out of here!

452
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,352
- Lieutenant!
- I'm working on it!

453
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:08,403
Hang on.

454
00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:21,166
Where to, Mr. Thatch?

455
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:23,627
We're looking for
a big crevice of some kind.

456
00:24:23,711 --> 00:24:24,920
There! Up ahead.

457
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:27,255
All craft, make your mark
20 degrees down angle.

458
00:24:27,548 --> 00:24:29,424
Roger! 20 degrees down angle.

459
00:24:29,592 --> 00:24:30,717
Right behind you!

460
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:36,181
- Sacré bleu!
- We're getting killed out here!

461
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:47,651
Look out!

462
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:52,572
It's only a grease trap.
It's just like a sink.

463
00:24:52,615 --> 00:24:54,491
It's only a grease trap.
It's just like a sink!

464
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,800
Seven hours ago,
we started this expedition

465
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:57,095
with 200 of the finest men and women
I've ever known.

466
00:25:58,264 --> 00:25:59,556
We're all that's left.

467
00:26:00,099 --> 00:26:01,850
I won't sugarcoat it, gentlemen.

468
00:26:01,934 --> 00:26:03,894
We have a crisis on our hands.

469
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:06,354
But we've been up
this particular creek before,

470
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:09,107
and we've always come through,
paddle or no paddle.

471
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,651
I see no reason
to change that policy now.

472
00:26:12,361 --> 00:26:14,780
From here on in,
everyone pulls double duty.

473
00:26:15,281 --> 00:26:17,157
Everyone drives, everyone works.

474
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:21,453
Looks like all our chances for survival
rest with you, Mr. Thatch.

475
00:26:21,954 --> 00:26:23,497
You and that little book.

476
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,332
We're all gonna die.

477
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,334
Okay, people. Saddle up.

478
00:26:27,418 --> 00:26:30,212
Lieutenant, I want this convoy
moving five minutes ago.

479
00:26:30,296 --> 00:26:31,379
Moliere, you're on point.

480
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:33,381
No, Vinny, Audrey's taking the oiler.

481
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:34,841
You know the rules. I want you 50 yards

482
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,635
behind that truck at all times.

483
00:26:36,677 --> 00:26:38,720
And, Packard, put out that cigarette.

484
00:26:46,854 --> 00:26:49,231
Are you sure you're checked out
on this class of vehicle?

485
00:26:50,149 --> 00:26:51,733
Can you drive a truck?

486
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,903
Of course I can drive a truck.

487
00:26:54,987 --> 00:26:56,863
I mean, sure, you got your steering,

488
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,323
and your gas, and your brake,

489
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:03,036
and of course, this metal-looking thing.

490
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:06,206
Okay, so it was a bumper car
at Coney Island,

491
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:07,624
but it's the same basic principle!

492
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,173
Come on! Move it!

493
00:27:15,883 --> 00:27:17,175
Sorry about... Sorry about that.

494
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,593
Come on, civilian!

495
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,051
You didn't just drink that, did you?

496
00:28:18,112 --> 00:28:19,154
That's not good.

497
00:28:19,238 --> 00:28:20,405
That's nitroglycerin.

498
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:21,531
Don't move.

499
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,283
Don't breathe.

500
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:26,286
Don't do anything, except pray, maybe.

501
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:27,746
Boom!

502
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,310
Yeah.

503
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,493
Good night!
Will you look at the size of this?

504
00:29:06,535 --> 00:29:08,578
It's gotta be half a mile high, at least.

505
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:10,247
It must have taken hundred...

506
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:13,166
No, thousands of years
to carve this thing.

507
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:19,839
Hey, look, I made a bridge.

508
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,383
It only took me, like, what?

509
00:29:21,467 --> 00:29:23,510
10 seconds, 11, tops.

510
00:29:42,321 --> 00:29:44,197
Looks like we have a little roadblock.

511
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:45,699
Vinny, what do you think?

512
00:29:45,783 --> 00:29:49,244
I could un-roadblock that
if I had about 200 of these.

513
00:29:49,328 --> 00:29:52,289
Problem is, I only got about 10.

514
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:54,708
Plus, you know, five of my own,

515
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:58,628
and a couple of cherry bombs,
a road flare.

516
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:02,382
Hey, too bad we don't have
some nitroglycerin, Milo?

517
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:06,052
Looks like we're gonna have to dig.

518
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,431
It will be my pleasure.

519
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,695
Stupid...

520
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,572
Stupid!

521
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:27,365
I don't understand it.

522
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:29,284
I just tuned this thing up this morning.

523
00:30:29,368 --> 00:30:31,619
It looks like the rotor's shot!

524
00:30:32,371 --> 00:30:34,247
I'm gonna have to pull
a spare from one of the trucks.

525
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,207
- Can I...
- No toques nada!

526
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:37,417
I'll be right back.

527
00:30:45,676 --> 00:30:47,302
She lives!

528
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:49,012
Hey, what'd you do?

529
00:30:49,096 --> 00:30:51,598
Well, you know, the boiler in this baby

530
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,683
is a Humac model P-54 stroke 813.

531
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:56,936
Now, we got the 814
back at the museum.

532
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,230
The heating cores
on the whole Humac line

533
00:30:59,273 --> 00:31:01,274
have always been a little,
you know, temperamental,

534
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,443
so sometimes you gotta... Boom!

535
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:04,527
Persuade 'em a little.

536
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:06,029
Yeah, yeah. Thank you very much.

537
00:31:06,113 --> 00:31:07,197
Shut up.

538
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:10,909
Two for flinching.

539
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:20,835
This is it. It's gotta be.

540
00:31:21,295 --> 00:31:23,421
All right, we'll make camp here.

541
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:24,881
Why is it glowing?

542
00:31:24,965 --> 00:31:27,717
It is a natural phosphorescence.

543
00:31:27,968 --> 00:31:31,054
That thing is going to
keep me up all night, I know it.

544
00:31:31,138 --> 00:31:32,972
Come and get it!

545
00:31:33,557 --> 00:31:36,184
For the appetizer, Caesar salad,

546
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:40,105
escargot, and your oriental spring rolls.

547
00:31:40,147 --> 00:31:42,065
- Yuck.
- I wanted the escargot.

548
00:31:42,149 --> 00:31:43,316
Knock yourself out.

549
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:46,111
There you go, Milo.

550
00:31:46,153 --> 00:31:47,821
Put some meat on them bones.

551
00:31:47,863 --> 00:31:50,698
Thanks, Cookie.
That looks greasier than usual.

552
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,867
You like it? Well, have some more.

553
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,994
You're so skinny,
if you turned sideways

554
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,119
and stuck out your tongue,
you'd look like a zipper.

555
00:31:57,289 --> 00:31:59,049
You know,
we've been pretty tough on the kid.

556
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,563
What do you say
we cut him some slack?

557
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:01,960
Yeah, you're right.

558
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:04,212
Hey, Milo!
Why don't you come sit with us?

559
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,381
Really? You don't mind?

560
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:07,799
Nah. Park it here.

561
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:09,509
Gee, this is great.

562
00:32:09,593 --> 00:32:11,834
I mean, you know,
it's an honor to be included in your...

563
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:19,227
- Mole!
- Forgive me.

564
00:32:19,895 --> 00:32:21,688
I could not resist.

565
00:32:21,772 --> 00:32:23,731
Hey, Milo,
don't you ever close that book?

566
00:32:24,024 --> 00:32:25,692
Yeah, you must've read it
a dozen times by now.

567
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,528
I know, but this...
This doesn't make any sense.

568
00:32:28,904 --> 00:32:30,738
See, in this passage here, the shepherd

569
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,073
seems to be leading up to something.

570
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,783
He calls it the heart of Atlantis.

571
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:36,578
It could be the power source
the legends refer to.

572
00:32:36,662 --> 00:32:38,955
But then, it just... It cuts off.

573
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,640
It's almost like there's a missing page.

574
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:42,250
Kid, relax.

575
00:32:42,334 --> 00:32:43,585
We don't get paid overtime.

576
00:32:43,669 --> 00:32:45,044
I know, I know.

577
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,880
Sometimes I get a little carried away.

578
00:32:46,922 --> 00:32:49,215
But hey, you know,
that's what this is all about, right?

579
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,885
I mean, discovery,
teamwork, adventure.

580
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,929
Unless, maybe...

581
00:32:55,222 --> 00:32:57,015
You're just in it for the money.

582
00:32:58,017 --> 00:33:00,143
- Money.
- Money.

583
00:33:00,227 --> 00:33:02,061
I'm gonna say... Money.

584
00:33:02,354 --> 00:33:05,440
Well, I guess
I set myself up for that one.

585
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:07,859
What, is something
wrong with your neck?

586
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,861
Oh, yeah, I must've hurt it when...

587
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:12,197
Better?

588
00:33:12,823 --> 00:33:14,073
Yeah!

589
00:33:14,116 --> 00:33:16,034
Hey, how'd you learn how to do that?

590
00:33:16,076 --> 00:33:18,077
- An Arapaho medicine man.
- Get outta here.

591
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,413
Born and raised with 'em.
My father was an army medic.

592
00:33:20,664 --> 00:33:23,500
He settled down in the Kansas
Territory after he met my mother.

593
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:24,959
- No kidding.
- Nope.

594
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:26,794
I got a sheepskin from Howard U,

595
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,922
and a bearskin from old Iron Cloud.

596
00:33:28,964 --> 00:33:30,798
Halfway through medical school,
I was drafted.

597
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:33,384
One day I'm studying gross anatomy
in the classroom,

598
00:33:33,427 --> 00:33:35,887
the next, I'm sewing up Rough Riders
on San Juan Hill.

599
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,096
Main course.

600
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,473
I couldn't eat another bite.

601
00:33:38,557 --> 00:33:39,766
I'm watching my weight.

602
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,267
Don't you worry.

603
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,853
It'll keep and keep and keep.

604
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:47,524
Thank God I lost my sense of taste
years ago.

605
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,531
Aren't you going to pitch up your tent?

606
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:56,199
I did.

607
00:33:57,868 --> 00:33:59,508
I guess I'm still a little rusty at this.

608
00:33:59,578 --> 00:34:01,371
I haven't gone camping since...

609
00:34:01,455 --> 00:34:02,956
Well, since the last time
my grandpa took me.

610
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,874
I never got to meet your grandfather.

611
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,084
What was he like?

612
00:34:06,168 --> 00:34:07,710
Where do you start?

613
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:09,796
He was like a father to me, really.

614
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:13,633
My parents died when I was
a little kid, and he took me in.

615
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,303
What?

616
00:34:17,721 --> 00:34:19,222
Well, I was just thinking.

617
00:34:19,598 --> 00:34:20,974
One time, when I was eight,

618
00:34:21,016 --> 00:34:22,850
we were hiking along this stream,

619
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:25,979
and I saw something
shining in the water.

620
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:27,647
It was a genuine arrowhead.

621
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:30,358
Well, you'd think I'd found
a lost civilization

622
00:34:30,442 --> 00:34:32,318
the way Grandpa carried on about it.

623
00:34:32,444 --> 00:34:34,654
It wasn't until I was older
that I realized that the arrowhead

624
00:34:34,738 --> 00:34:35,938
was just some compressed shale

625
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,282
mixed with zinc pyrite that had fractured

626
00:34:37,324 --> 00:34:39,075
into an isosceletic triangulate.

627
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:41,703
That is so cute!

628
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,622
Say, Audrey, no offense,

629
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:47,000
but how does a teenager
become the chief mechanic

630
00:34:47,042 --> 00:34:48,626
of a multimillion dollar expedition?

631
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:50,795
Well, I took this job
when my dad retired.

632
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:53,756
But the funny thing was
he always wanted sons, right?

633
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,633
One to run his machine shop
and the other

634
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:57,677
to be middleweight boxing champion.

635
00:34:57,761 --> 00:34:59,762
But he got my sister and me instead.

636
00:35:01,056 --> 00:35:02,765
So, what happened to your sister?

637
00:35:02,891 --> 00:35:05,393
She's 24-0 with a shot
at the title next month.

638
00:35:06,061 --> 00:35:07,562
Anyway, I'm saving up

639
00:35:07,646 --> 00:35:09,897
so my papi and I
can open another shop.

640
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:11,608
Forget your jammies, Mrs. Packard?

641
00:35:11,775 --> 00:35:13,318
I sleep in the nude.

642
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,153
You're gonna want a pair of these.

643
00:35:15,195 --> 00:35:16,529
She sleepwalks.

644
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:18,781
Well, as far as me goes,

645
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,742
I just like to blow things up.

646
00:35:20,826 --> 00:35:22,702
Come on, Vinny, tell the kid the truth.

647
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:26,873
My family owned a flower shop.

648
00:35:26,915 --> 00:35:28,791
We would sell roses,

649
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:31,836
carnations, baby's breath, you name it.

650
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:33,671
One day, I'm making

651
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:37,383
about three dozen corsages
for this prom.

652
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:39,761
You know, the one
they put on their wrist.

653
00:35:39,845 --> 00:35:42,430
And everybody, they come.
"Where is it?"

654
00:35:42,514 --> 00:35:45,058
"When is it?"
"Does it match my dress?"

655
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:47,060
It's a nightmare.

656
00:35:47,144 --> 00:35:50,480
Anyway, I guess
there was this leak next door

657
00:35:50,564 --> 00:35:52,523
of gas or what. Boom!

658
00:35:52,566 --> 00:35:53,941
No more Chinese laundry.

659
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,361
Blew me right through the front window.

660
00:35:56,403 --> 00:35:58,863
It was like a sign from God.

661
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:01,240
I found myself that boom.

662
00:36:06,538 --> 00:36:07,664
What's Mole's story?

663
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:09,666
Trust me on this one.
You don't wanna know.

664
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:12,502
Audrey, don't tell him. You shouldn't
have told me, but you did.

665
00:36:12,586 --> 00:36:14,921
And now, I'm telling you,
you don't wanna know.

666
00:36:45,744 --> 00:36:47,745
The redhead's got a gun.

667
00:37:05,889 --> 00:37:07,014
Holy...

668
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:14,564
Fire.

669
00:37:17,651 --> 00:37:18,151
Fire!

670
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:24,824
I'm gonna kill him.

671
00:37:24,908 --> 00:37:26,659
Thatch, go back to bed.

672
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,455
Get some water on that fire!

673
00:37:30,497 --> 00:37:31,497
No time!

674
00:37:31,623 --> 00:37:32,874
Get us into those caves!

675
00:37:32,958 --> 00:37:34,125
Move it! Move it! Move it!

676
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:41,174
Gertie, pull!

677
00:37:45,387 --> 00:37:47,472
Milo, jump! Right now!

678
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:11,537
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

679
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:39,941
All right, who's not dead? Sound off.

680
00:38:42,152 --> 00:38:45,571
Danged lightning bugs
done bit me on my sit upon.

681
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:48,157
Somebody's gonna have to
suck out that poison.

682
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:49,867
Now, don't everybody jump up at once.

683
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:52,995
Audrey, give me a damage report.

684
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,331
Not as bad as it could have been.

685
00:38:55,415 --> 00:38:56,958
We totaled rigs two and seven,

686
00:38:57,042 --> 00:38:59,335
but the digger looks like it'll still run.

687
00:38:59,878 --> 00:39:02,171
Lucky for us
we landed in something soft.

688
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:04,090
Pumice ash.

689
00:39:04,132 --> 00:39:07,134
We are standing at the base
of a dormant volcano.

690
00:39:10,347 --> 00:39:11,639
It just keeps going.

691
00:39:12,015 --> 00:39:13,432
Maybe that's our ticket outta here.

692
00:39:14,351 --> 00:39:15,434
Maybe not.

693
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:19,856
The magma has solidified
in the bowels of the volcano,

694
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,691
effectively blocking the exit.

695
00:39:21,775 --> 00:39:24,485
I got the same problem with sauerkraut.

696
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,112
Hold on. Back up.

697
00:39:26,196 --> 00:39:29,115
Are you saying this whole volcano
can blow at any time?

698
00:39:29,157 --> 00:39:30,408
No, no, no, no.

699
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:34,453
That would take
an explosive force of great magnitude.

700
00:39:39,376 --> 00:39:41,127
Maybe I should do this later?

701
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:43,462
If we could blow the top off of that thing,

702
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,631
we'd have a straight shot to the surface.

703
00:39:45,799 --> 00:39:47,466
Mr. Thatch, what do you think?

704
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:48,634
Mr. Thatch?

705
00:39:49,511 --> 00:39:51,053
Thatch?

706
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:41,187
Hey, wait!

707
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:47,193
Who are you? Where are you going?

708
00:40:48,153 --> 00:40:49,278
Come back!

709
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:58,537
Hey, wait a minute!

710
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,164
Who are you?

711
00:41:27,317 --> 00:41:29,276
Sweet mother of Jefferson Davis!

712
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:30,820
It's beautiful.

713
00:41:31,488 --> 00:41:33,072
Milo, I gotta hand it to you.

714
00:41:33,156 --> 00:41:34,407
You really came through.

715
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:39,412
I take that back.

716
00:41:39,496 --> 00:41:41,664
Holy cats! Who are these guys?

717
00:41:41,748 --> 00:41:44,917
- They gotta be Atlanteans.
- What? That's impossible!

718
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:47,169
I seen this back in the Dakota.

719
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:50,006
They can smell fear
just by looking at ya.

720
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,173
So, keep quiet.

721
00:41:58,515 --> 00:42:00,266
I think it's talking to you.

722
00:42:30,797 --> 00:42:32,131
Parlez-vous français?

723
00:42:32,215 --> 00:42:33,215
Oui, monsieur!

724
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,633
They speak my language!

725
00:42:34,676 --> 00:42:35,885
Pardon, mademoiselle.

726
00:42:35,969 --> 00:42:38,262
Voulez-vous...

727
00:42:39,681 --> 00:42:40,848
I like her.

728
00:42:40,932 --> 00:42:42,767
'Bout time someone hit him.

729
00:42:42,809 --> 00:42:44,101
I'm just sorry it wasn't me.

730
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:48,814
How do they know all these languages?

731
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:51,650
Their language must be
based on a root dialect.

732
00:42:51,693 --> 00:42:53,319
It's just like the Tower of Babel.

733
00:42:53,361 --> 00:42:55,446
Well, maybe English
is in there somewhere.

734
00:42:55,947 --> 00:42:58,657
We are explorers
from the surface world.

735
00:42:59,242 --> 00:43:00,826
We come in peace.

736
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:03,871
Welcome to the city of Atlantis.

737
00:43:04,539 --> 00:43:07,166
Come. You must speak
with my father now.

738
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:10,169
Squad "B," head back
to the shaft and salvage what you can.

739
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:12,463
- Yes, sir!
- We'll rendezvous in 24 hours.

740
00:43:12,547 --> 00:43:14,256
Let's move it. You heard him.

741
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,511
I'm so excited!

742
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:31,885
Now, what's really amazing is that

743
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,400
if you deconstructed Latin,
you overlaid it

744
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:35,569
with a little Sumerian,
throw in a dash of Thessalonian,

745
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:37,655
you'd be getting close to
their basic grammatical structure.

746
00:43:37,697 --> 00:43:39,073
Or at least you'd be
in the same ballpark...

747
00:43:39,157 --> 00:43:42,493
- Someone's having a good time.
- Like a kid at Christmas.

748
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:46,914
Commander, there were
not supposed to be people down here.

749
00:43:46,998 --> 00:43:48,207
This changes everything.

750
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,042
This changes nothing.

751
00:43:50,752 --> 00:43:52,336
Take that, Mr. Harcourt!

752
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:52,271
Your Majesty?

753
00:44:52,355 --> 00:44:53,606
On behalf of my crew,

754
00:44:53,648 --> 00:44:56,525
may I say it is an honor
to be welcomed to your city.

755
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:58,152
Excuse me? Commander?

756
00:44:58,236 --> 00:45:01,655
You presume much
to think you are welcome here.

757
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:04,700
Oh, sir, we have come
a long way looking for...

758
00:45:04,784 --> 00:45:09,079
I know what you seek,
and you will not find it here.

759
00:45:09,706 --> 00:45:11,498
Your journey has been in vain.

760
00:45:11,833 --> 00:45:14,793
But we are peaceful explorers,
men of science.

761
00:45:16,838 --> 00:45:19,131
And yet you bring weapons.

762
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:23,469
Our weapons allow us to remove
obstacles we may encounter.

763
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:28,390
Some obstacles cannot be
removed with a mere show of force.

764
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:33,354
Return to your people.
You must leave Atlantis at once.

765
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:35,814
Oh, Your Majesty, be reasonable.

766
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,650
- Sir...
- Not now, son.

767
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:40,319
Trust me on this.
We better do as he says.

768
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:46,200
May I respectfully request
that we stay one night, sir?

769
00:45:46,284 --> 00:45:49,119
That would give us
time to rest, resupply,

770
00:45:49,162 --> 00:45:50,746
and be ready to travel by morning.

771
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:54,583
Very well. One night.

772
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:56,710
That is all.

773
00:45:56,878 --> 00:45:58,879
Well, thank you, Your Majesty.

774
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:08,889
Your heart has softened, Kida.

775
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:12,184
A thousand years ago,
you would have slain them on sight.

776
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:14,728
A thousand years ago,
the streets were lit,

777
00:46:14,854 --> 00:46:17,648
and our people did not
have to scavenge for food

778
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:19,108
at the edge of a crumbling city!

779
00:46:19,192 --> 00:46:20,693
The people are content.

780
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:22,695
They do not know any better!

781
00:46:22,737 --> 00:46:25,406
We were once a great people.
Now we live in ruins.

782
00:46:26,032 --> 00:46:28,200
The kings of our past would weep

783
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:30,035
if they could see how far we have fallen.

784
00:46:30,203 --> 00:46:32,663
- Kida.
- If these outsiders

785
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:35,708
can unlock the secrets of our past,

786
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:37,710
perhaps we can save our future.

787
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:42,631
What they have to teach us
we have already learned.

788
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:45,217
Our way of life is dying.

789
00:46:45,927 --> 00:46:47,886
Our way of life is preserved.

790
00:46:47,929 --> 00:46:53,559
Kida, when you take the throne,
you will understand.

791
00:46:56,813 --> 00:46:58,230
- So, how'd it go?
- Well,

792
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,983
the King and his daughter
don't exactly see eye to eye.

793
00:47:01,067 --> 00:47:03,360
She seems to like us okay,
but the King...

794
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:05,123
I don't know. I think
he's hiding something.

795
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:08,574
Well, if he's hiding something,
I want to know what it is.

796
00:47:08,658 --> 00:47:11,035
- Someone needs to talk to that girl.
- I will go!

797
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,912
- Someone with good people skills.
- I will do it!

798
00:47:13,955 --> 00:47:16,123
- Someone who won't scare her away.
- I volunteer!

799
00:47:16,207 --> 00:47:18,167
Someone who can speak the language.

800
00:47:18,251 --> 00:47:20,169
For the good of the mission, I will go!

801
00:47:20,253 --> 00:47:22,963
Good man, Thatch.
Thanks for volunteering.

802
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:27,760
Go get 'em, tiger.

803
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,268
Okay, Milo, don't take no for an answer.

804
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:37,519
"Look, I have some questions for you,

805
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:39,980
"and I'm not leaving this city
until they're answered!" Yeah, that's it.

806
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:41,482
That's good, that's good.

807
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:49,114
I have some questions for you,

808
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:52,159
and you are not leaving this city
until they are answered.

809
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:55,204
- Yeah, well, I... Okay.
- Come with me.

810
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:06,048
Oh, there is so much
to ask about your world.

811
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:08,675
You are a scholar, are you not?

812
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,470
Judging from your diminished
physique and large forehead,

813
00:48:11,554 --> 00:48:13,138
you are suited for nothing else.

814
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:14,765
What is your country of origin?

815
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:16,475
When did the flood waters recede?

816
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:17,601
- How did you...
- Wait a minute.

817
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:19,103
I got a few questions for you, too.

818
00:48:19,145 --> 00:48:21,146
So let's do this, okay?
You ask one, then I'll ask one,

819
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:23,732
then you, then me, then...
Well, you get it.

820
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:26,693
Very well. What is your first question?

821
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:29,154
Well, okay, how did you get here?

822
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:31,657
Well, I mean, not you, personally,
but your culture.

823
00:48:31,699 --> 00:48:34,326
I mean, how did all of this
end up down here?

824
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:37,579
It is said that
the gods became jealous of Atlantis.

825
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:40,749
They sent a great cataclysm
and banished us here.

826
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:43,502
All I can remember is the sky going dark

827
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:46,672
and people shouting and running.

828
00:48:47,006 --> 00:48:50,717
Then, a bright light, like a star

829
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:52,261
floating above the city.

830
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:55,472
My father said it called my mother to it.

831
00:48:56,349 --> 00:48:57,683
I never saw her again.

832
00:48:57,725 --> 00:49:00,185
I'm sorry. If it's any consolation,

833
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,229
I know how you feel, because I lost my...

834
00:49:02,313 --> 00:49:04,857
Wait a minute. Wait a minute!
Back up!

835
00:49:04,941 --> 00:49:06,483
What are you telling me?

836
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:08,402
That you remember
because you were there?

837
00:49:08,486 --> 00:49:09,847
No, that's... That's impossible...

838
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:11,780
Because, I mean,
that would make you...

839
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:15,576
You know, 8,500-8,800 years old.

840
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:16,702
Yes.

841
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:21,373
Oh, well. Hey. Looking good.

842
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:23,667
Just...

843
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:25,502
- You got another question for me?
- Yes.

844
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:28,213
How is it you found
your way to this place?

845
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:29,696
Well, I'll tell you, it wasn't easy.

846
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:31,957
If it weren't for this book,
we never would have made it.

847
00:49:33,511 --> 00:49:35,991
Okay, second question. Legend has it
that your people possessed

848
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:38,056
a power source of some kind
that enabled them...

849
00:49:38,099 --> 00:49:40,976
- You mean you can understand this?
- Yes, I'm a linguist.

850
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:42,186
That's what I do, that's my job.

851
00:49:42,228 --> 00:49:44,771
- Now, getting back to my question...
- This, right here,

852
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:45,939
you can read this?

853
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:48,567
Yes, yes.
I can read Atlantean, just like you.

854
00:49:50,403 --> 00:49:52,738
You can't, can you?

855
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:53,906
No one can.

856
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:55,365
Such knowledge has been lost to us

857
00:49:55,408 --> 00:49:56,950
since the time of the mehbehlmoak.

858
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:58,702
Oh, the Great Flood.

859
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,413
- Show me.
- Okay...

860
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:07,044
"Follow the narrow passage
for another league."

861
00:50:07,086 --> 00:50:09,588
"There, you will find the fifth marker."

862
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:12,132
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.
How was my accent?

863
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:13,842
Boorish, provincial...

864
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:17,012
- And you speak it through your nose.
- Yeah, gotta work on that.

865
00:50:17,096 --> 00:50:19,056
Here, let me show you something.

866
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:26,063
What? It looks like some sort of vehicle.

867
00:50:26,105 --> 00:50:29,942
Yes. But no matter what I try,
it will not respond.

868
00:50:30,026 --> 00:50:31,568
- Perhaps if...
- Way ahead of you.

869
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:33,487
Okay, let's see what we got here.

870
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:37,032
Okay. "Place crystal into slot."

871
00:50:37,116 --> 00:50:38,325
Yes, yes, I have done that!

872
00:50:38,409 --> 00:50:40,994
"Gently place your hand
on the inscription pad."

873
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:42,454
- Yes!
- Okay, did you turn the crystal

874
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,248
- one-quarter turn back?
- Yes. Yes!

875
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:46,583
While your hand was
on the inscription pad?

876
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:47,709
No.

877
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:50,879
Well. See, there's
your problem right there.

878
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:52,714
That's an easy thing to miss.
You know, you deserve credit

879
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,675
for even getting this far.

880
00:50:56,010 --> 00:50:57,344
Okay, give it a try.

881
00:51:06,771 --> 00:51:08,063
Yeah, you got that right.

882
00:51:08,606 --> 00:51:11,358
This is great! With this thing,

883
00:51:11,442 --> 00:51:13,652
I could see the whole city
in no time at all.

884
00:51:13,736 --> 00:51:15,028
Wonder how fast it goes.

885
00:51:23,788 --> 00:51:26,164
So, who's hungry?

886
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:30,002
By the way, we were never
properly introduced.

887
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:31,420
My name's Milo.

888
00:51:31,504 --> 00:51:33,505
My name is Kidagakash.

889
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,674
Kidamaschnaga.

890
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:37,843
Hey, you got a nickname?

891
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:39,553
Kida.

892
00:51:39,637 --> 00:51:42,848
Okay, Kida. I can remember that.

893
00:52:06,205 --> 00:52:07,331
What is wrong?

894
00:52:07,373 --> 00:52:10,834
Oh, it's nothing. I just...
Got something in my eye.

895
00:52:11,377 --> 00:52:13,097
You know, my grandpa
used to tell me stories

896
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:15,631
about this place
as far back as I can remember.

897
00:52:16,674 --> 00:52:18,717
I just wish he could be
standing here with me.

898
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:38,779
Tell me more about your companions.

899
00:52:38,863 --> 00:52:41,198
Your physician, he is called Cookie?

900
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:42,449
- No, that's Sweet.
- What is?

901
00:52:42,533 --> 00:52:43,742
The doctor. He's Sweet.

902
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:45,160
Oh, he is kindly.

903
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:47,015
No, no, no, that's... That's his name.

904
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,872
- His name is Kindly?
- No, Sweet.

905
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:50,582
Well, I mean, he's kindly, too.

906
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:54,294
So all of your doctors
are sweet and kindly?

907
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:56,922
No. Well, I'm sure some are.

908
00:52:56,964 --> 00:52:59,299
Ours is, but that's not a requirement.

909
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:01,635
- You're missing the point.
- You are confusing me.

910
00:53:01,719 --> 00:53:04,763
Look at all those tattoos.

911
00:53:04,847 --> 00:53:06,431
Shoot. That ain't nothing.

912
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:07,641
Look here what I got.

913
00:53:07,725 --> 00:53:10,310
All 38 United States.

914
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:12,354
Watch me make Rhode Island dance.

915
00:53:12,438 --> 00:53:14,272
Go on, baby, dance. Dance.

916
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:16,358
There you go.

917
00:53:29,288 --> 00:53:31,790
Cookies are sweet, but yours is not.

918
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:34,459
Sweet is kindly,
but that is not his name.

919
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:38,630
Audrey is sweet,
but she is not your doctor.

920
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:42,426
And the little digging animal
called Mole...

921
00:53:42,468 --> 00:53:43,927
He is your pet?

922
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:45,053
Close enough.

923
00:53:47,765 --> 00:53:49,599
Oh, don't forget to eat the head.

924
00:53:49,642 --> 00:53:51,042
That's where all the nutrients are.

925
00:54:11,497 --> 00:54:13,457
You know, Kida,
the most we ever hoped to find

926
00:54:13,499 --> 00:54:16,168
was some crumbling buildings,
maybe some broken pottery.

927
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:20,172
Instead, we find a living,
thriving society.

928
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,257
These guys are kinda cute

929
00:54:22,341 --> 00:54:25,343
when they're not, you know,
formed into a fiery column of death.

930
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:27,345
We are not thriving.

931
00:54:27,388 --> 00:54:30,682
True, our people live,
but our culture is dying.

932
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:34,144
We are like a stone
the ocean beats against.

933
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:37,189
With each passing year,
a little more of us is worn away.

934
00:54:37,982 --> 00:54:39,566
I wish there was something I could do.

935
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:42,986
I have brought you to this place
to ask you for your help.

936
00:54:43,529 --> 00:54:47,157
There is a mural here
with writing all around the pictures.

937
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,367
Yeah, well, you came to the right guy.

938
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:52,120
Okay, let me see.
Let's start with this column right here.

939
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:56,124
Well, this... Kida?

940
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:02,047
- What are you doing?
- You do swim, do you not?

941
00:55:02,131 --> 00:55:03,548
Oh, I swim, pretty girl.

942
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:04,883
Pretty good! Pretty good.

943
00:55:04,967 --> 00:55:07,552
Good, swim good.
Pretty good. I swim pretty good.

944
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:11,056
Good. It is a fair distance
to where we are going.

945
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:14,059
Hey, you are talking
to the belly flop champ

946
00:55:14,101 --> 00:55:15,977
at Camp Runamuck.

947
00:55:17,688 --> 00:55:19,731
Come on, we're wasting time.

948
00:55:22,568 --> 00:55:25,946
Why don't you lead the way, because

949
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:27,823
I have no idea where we're going.

950
00:55:46,968 --> 00:55:50,011
- Are you all right?
- Well, I didn't drown, so...

951
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:51,429
Good. Follow me.

952
00:56:07,154 --> 00:56:08,446
This is amazing!

953
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,115
A complete history of Atlantis!

954
00:56:10,199 --> 00:56:11,950
It's just like Plato described it.

955
00:56:12,034 --> 00:56:15,120
Well, he was off on a few details, but...

956
00:56:15,204 --> 00:56:16,496
The light I saw.

957
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:18,623
The star in the middle of the city.

958
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:20,792
What does the writing say about that?

959
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:22,168
I don't know yet.

960
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:24,129
But we're gonna find out.

961
00:56:24,213 --> 00:56:25,297
Come on.

962
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:06,254
- The heart of Atlantis!
- What?

963
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:09,466
It's the heart of Atlantis! That's
what the shepherd was talking about.

964
00:57:09,508 --> 00:57:11,551
It wasn't a star, it was...
It was some kind of crystal.

965
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:14,346
Like these! Don't you get it?

966
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:16,848
The power source I've been looking for,

967
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:18,516
the bright light you remember.

968
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:20,852
- They're the same thing!
- That cannot be.

969
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:22,938
It's what's keeping all these things...

970
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:25,023
You, all of Atlantis alive.

971
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:26,483
Then where is it now?

972
00:57:26,525 --> 00:57:27,734
I don't know, I don't know.
You'd think something

973
00:57:27,818 --> 00:57:30,028
this important
would have been in the Journal, but...

974
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:33,281
Unless... The missing page.

975
00:57:38,829 --> 00:57:40,038
You have a nice swim?

976
00:57:43,125 --> 00:57:45,043
Hey, guys, what's going on?

977
00:57:45,127 --> 00:57:47,712
What's... What's with all the guns?

978
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:50,548
Guys?

979
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,219
I am such an idiot.

980
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:56,012
This is just another
treasure hunt for you.

981
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:58,848
- You're after the crystal.
- Oh, you mean this?

982
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:01,893
The heart of Atlantis.

983
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:05,438
Yeah. About that,
I would've told you sooner,

984
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:07,565
but it was strictly
on a need-to-know basis.

985
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,567
And, well, now you know.

986
00:58:09,735 --> 00:58:11,444
I had to be sure you were one of us.

987
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:13,446
Welcome to the club, son.

988
00:58:13,572 --> 00:58:15,240
I'm no mercenary.

989
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:29,254
Mercenary?

990
00:58:29,338 --> 00:58:32,757
I prefer the term "adventure capitalist."

991
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,259
Besides, you're the one
who got us here.

992
00:58:34,343 --> 00:58:36,052
You led us right to the treasure chest.

993
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:37,762
You don't know what
you're tampering with, Rourke.

994
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:40,348
What's to know? It's big. It's shiny.

995
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:41,850
It's going to make us all rich.

996
00:58:41,934 --> 00:58:43,018
You think it's some kind of a diamond,

997
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:45,770
I thought it was some kind of a battery,
but we're both wrong.

998
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:47,480
It's their life force.

999
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:49,566
That crystal is the only thing
keeping these people alive.

1000
00:58:49,608 --> 00:58:51,317
You take that away, and they'll die.

1001
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:53,528
Well, that changes things.

1002
00:58:53,612 --> 00:58:57,449
- Helga, what do you think?
- Knowing that, I'd double the price.

1003
00:58:57,533 --> 00:58:59,034
I was thinking triple.

1004
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:01,453
Rourke, don't do this.

1005
00:59:01,495 --> 00:59:04,914
Academics. You never want
to get your hands dirty.

1006
00:59:05,374 --> 00:59:06,541
Think about it.

1007
00:59:06,625 --> 00:59:09,836
If you gave back
every stolen artifact from a museum,

1008
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,713
you'd be left with an empty building.

1009
00:59:11,797 --> 00:59:14,632
We're just providing
a necessary service

1010
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:16,926
to the archeological community.

1011
00:59:16,969 --> 00:59:18,470
Not interested.

1012
00:59:18,804 --> 00:59:21,097
I got to admit, I'm disappointed.

1013
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:23,767
You're an idealist,
just like your grandfather.

1014
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:27,020
Do yourself a favor, Milo.
Don't be like him.

1015
00:59:27,104 --> 00:59:29,439
For once, do the smart thing.

1016
00:59:31,942 --> 00:59:34,486
I really hate it
when negotiations go sour.

1017
00:59:38,657 --> 00:59:40,492
Let's try this again.

1018
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:47,499
- Knock, knock.
- Room service.

1019
00:59:48,667 --> 00:59:50,960
Tell them to drop their weapons... Now!

1020
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:56,007
Spread out! Search everywhere!

1021
00:59:57,259 --> 00:59:58,802
You're not applying yourself, son.

1022
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:00,207
There's got to be something else.

1023
01:00:00,262 --> 01:00:02,097
Well, there isn't. It just says,

1024
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:04,849
"The heart of Atlantis lies
in the eyes of her king."

1025
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:06,643
Well, then maybe Old King Cole here

1026
01:00:06,685 --> 01:00:08,603
can help us fill in the blanks.

1027
01:00:08,687 --> 01:00:11,314
How about it, chief?
Where's the crystal chamber?

1028
01:00:11,357 --> 01:00:13,233
You will destroy yourselves.

1029
01:00:13,317 --> 01:00:15,527
Maybe I'm not being clear.

1030
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:21,741
Rourke, this was not a part of the plan.

1031
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:23,576
Plan's changed, doc.

1032
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:26,101
I'd suggest you put a bandage
on that bleeding heart of yours.

1033
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:28,373
It doesn't suit a mercenary.

1034
01:00:28,457 --> 01:00:31,793
Well, as usual, diplomacy has failed us.

1035
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:33,628
Now, I'm going to count to 10.

1036
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:35,758
And you're going to tell me
where the crystal is.

1037
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:37,924
One...

1038
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:39,467
Two...

1039
01:00:39,885 --> 01:00:41,219
Nine...

1040
01:00:41,595 --> 01:00:42,887
T...

1041
01:00:49,603 --> 01:00:53,106
The heart of Atlantis
lies in the eyes of her king.

1042
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:55,275
This is it. We're in.

1043
01:00:55,359 --> 01:00:57,735
Rourke, for the last time,
you've got to listen to me.

1044
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:00,738
You don't have the slightest idea
what this power is capable of.

1045
01:01:00,781 --> 01:01:03,408
True, but I can think of a few countries

1046
01:01:03,492 --> 01:01:06,411
who'd pay anything to find out.

1047
01:01:09,498 --> 01:01:10,832
Hurry. Get on.

1048
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:32,103
Jackpot.

1049
01:01:42,823 --> 01:01:44,699
The kings of our past.

1050
01:01:48,162 --> 01:01:49,913
Thatch, tell her to wrap it up.

1051
01:01:49,955 --> 01:01:51,539
We got a schedule to meet.

1052
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:00,840
Kida...

1053
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:03,009
I'm sorry.

1054
01:02:15,522 --> 01:02:17,398
Come on, let's get this over with.

1055
01:02:17,483 --> 01:02:18,483
I don't like this place.

1056
01:02:18,692 --> 01:02:20,568
All right, Thatch, what's next?

1057
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:22,654
Okay, there's a giant crystal

1058
01:02:22,738 --> 01:02:24,447
hovering 150 feet above our heads

1059
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:25,990
over a bottomless pit of water.

1060
01:02:26,033 --> 01:02:27,659
Doesn't anything surprise you?

1061
01:02:27,701 --> 01:02:29,953
The only thing that surprises me
is you're still

1062
01:02:30,371 --> 01:02:31,996
talking and
that thing's not on the truck yet.

1063
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:34,624
- Now move it!
- I don't know how to move it.

1064
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:36,793
I don't even know
what's holding it up there.

1065
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:46,678
Talk to me, Thatch. What's happening?

1066
01:02:46,762 --> 01:02:50,139
Look, all it says here
is that the crystal is alive, somehow.

1067
01:02:50,182 --> 01:02:51,683
I don't know how to explain it.

1068
01:02:51,725 --> 01:02:54,143
It's their deity. It's their power source.

1069
01:02:54,186 --> 01:02:55,895
Speak English, professor.

1070
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,689
They're a part of it. It's a part of them.

1071
01:02:57,731 --> 01:02:59,691
I'm doing the best I can here.

1072
01:02:59,733 --> 01:03:01,401
- Well, do better.
- Oh, I know.

1073
01:03:01,485 --> 01:03:04,153
Why don't you translate,
and I'll wave the gun around?

1074
01:03:12,913 --> 01:03:14,372
What did she say?

1075
01:03:14,415 --> 01:03:16,833
I don't know. I didn't catch it.

1076
01:05:36,890 --> 01:05:38,766
Hold your horses, lover boy.

1077
01:05:40,894 --> 01:05:41,394
Kida.

1078
01:06:11,884 --> 01:06:13,885
No, don't. Don't touch her.

1079
01:06:30,235 --> 01:06:31,944
All right, step back.

1080
01:06:32,696 --> 01:06:34,572
Sergeant, keep those people back.

1081
01:06:35,073 --> 01:06:36,699
You heard him. Step back.

1082
01:06:38,285 --> 01:06:39,535
I'm warning you.

1083
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:41,037
So...

1084
01:06:41,747 --> 01:06:43,539
I guess this is how it ends?

1085
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:45,666
Fine. You win.

1086
01:06:45,876 --> 01:06:47,835
You're wiping out an entire civilization,

1087
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:50,213
but hey... You'll be rich.

1088
01:06:50,422 --> 01:06:51,923
Congratulations, Audrey.

1089
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:53,466
Guess you and your dad will be able

1090
01:06:53,550 --> 01:06:55,843
to open up that second garage after all.

1091
01:06:56,678 --> 01:06:59,055
And, Vinny, you can start
a whole chain of flower shops.

1092
01:06:59,097 --> 01:07:01,140
I'm sure your family's
going to be very proud.

1093
01:07:01,266 --> 01:07:03,518
But that's what it's all about, right?

1094
01:07:04,645 --> 01:07:07,480
- Money.
- Get off your soapbox, Thatch.

1095
01:07:07,564 --> 01:07:10,149
You've read Darwin.
It's called natural selection.

1096
01:07:10,442 --> 01:07:11,943
We're just helping it along.

1097
01:07:11,985 --> 01:07:14,570
- Commander, we're ready.
- Yeah, give me a minute.

1098
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:16,239
I know I'm forgetting something.

1099
01:07:16,281 --> 01:07:19,242
I got the cargo, the crystal, the crew...

1100
01:07:19,284 --> 01:07:21,160
Oh, yeah.

1101
01:07:23,830 --> 01:07:25,623
Look at it this way, son.

1102
01:07:25,707 --> 01:07:27,959
You were the man
who discovered Atlantis,

1103
01:07:28,043 --> 01:07:30,336
and now, you're part of the exhibit.

1104
01:07:39,263 --> 01:07:40,805
Let's move, people.

1105
01:07:41,473 --> 01:07:44,392
That was an order,
not a suggestion. Let's go!

1106
01:08:24,141 --> 01:08:26,017
We're all going to die.

1107
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:32,273
Oh, you can't be serious.

1108
01:08:32,357 --> 01:08:33,733
This is wrong, and you know it.

1109
01:08:34,109 --> 01:08:36,068
We're this close
to our biggest payday ever,

1110
01:08:36,153 --> 01:08:38,613
and you pick now of all times
to grow a conscience.

1111
01:08:39,072 --> 01:08:40,781
We've done a lot of things
we're not proud of,

1112
01:08:40,866 --> 01:08:44,035
robbing graves, plundering tombs,

1113
01:08:44,077 --> 01:08:47,413
double parking, but nobody got hurt.

1114
01:08:47,789 --> 01:08:51,375
Well, maybe somebody got hurt,
but nobody we knew.

1115
01:08:51,501 --> 01:08:53,961
Well, if that's the way you want it, fine.

1116
01:08:54,046 --> 01:08:55,463
More for me.

1117
01:08:57,049 --> 01:08:59,216
P.T. Barnum was right.

1118
01:09:18,737 --> 01:09:20,696
- We can't let him do this!
- Wait a second.

1119
01:09:36,088 --> 01:09:37,588
Okay, now you can go.

1120
01:09:37,631 --> 01:09:39,965
Milo, you better get up here.

1121
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:45,054
How's he doing?

1122
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:47,223
Not good, I'm afraid.

1123
01:09:47,265 --> 01:09:48,683
Internal bleeding.

1124
01:09:48,975 --> 01:09:50,518
There's nothing more I can do.

1125
01:09:50,602 --> 01:09:51,769
What a nightmare.

1126
01:09:52,270 --> 01:09:55,439
- And I brought it here.
- Don't go beating yourself up.

1127
01:09:55,482 --> 01:09:57,233
He's been after that crystal
since Iceland.

1128
01:09:59,069 --> 01:10:01,112
The crystal. Sweet, that's it.

1129
01:10:01,154 --> 01:10:04,573
These... These crystals,
they have some sort of healing energy.

1130
01:10:04,616 --> 01:10:06,575
I've seen it work.

1131
01:10:06,618 --> 01:10:07,702
No.

1132
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:09,787
Where is my daughter?

1133
01:10:09,996 --> 01:10:11,831
Well, she...

1134
01:10:13,291 --> 01:10:16,127
She has been chosen,
like her mother before her.

1135
01:10:16,795 --> 01:10:17,878
What?

1136
01:10:17,963 --> 01:10:19,463
In times of danger,

1137
01:10:19,506 --> 01:10:21,799
the crystal will choose a host,

1138
01:10:21,842 --> 01:10:25,010
one of royal blood, to protect itself

1139
01:10:25,095 --> 01:10:26,345
and its people.

1140
01:10:26,888 --> 01:10:28,347
It will accept no other.

1141
01:10:28,432 --> 01:10:30,599
Wait a minute. Choose?

1142
01:10:30,642 --> 01:10:32,727
So this thing is alive?

1143
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:34,145
In a way.

1144
01:10:34,813 --> 01:10:36,689
The crystal thrives

1145
01:10:36,773 --> 01:10:40,651
on the collective emotions
of all who came before us.

1146
01:10:41,236 --> 01:10:44,780
In return, it provides power,

1147
01:10:44,823 --> 01:10:47,658
longevity, protection.

1148
01:10:47,826 --> 01:10:49,368
As it grew,

1149
01:10:49,453 --> 01:10:52,496
it developed
a consciousness of its own.

1150
01:10:54,708 --> 01:10:56,417
In my arrogance,

1151
01:10:56,501 --> 01:10:59,670
I sought to use it as a weapon of war,

1152
01:10:59,713 --> 01:11:03,674
but it's power proved
too great to control.

1153
01:11:04,259 --> 01:11:08,637
It overwhelmed us
and led to our destruction.

1154
01:11:09,347 --> 01:11:11,515
That's why you hid it beneath the city.

1155
01:11:11,558 --> 01:11:13,350
To keep history from repeating itself.

1156
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:19,023
And to prevent Kida from suffering
the same fate as my beloved wife.

1157
01:11:19,107 --> 01:11:22,193
What do you mean?
What's going to happen to Kida?

1158
01:11:22,235 --> 01:11:25,863
If she remains bonded to the crystal,

1159
01:11:25,906 --> 01:11:29,241
she could be lost to it forever.

1160
01:11:30,744 --> 01:11:33,704
The love of my daughter
is all I have left.

1161
01:11:34,873 --> 01:11:37,166
My burden would have become hers

1162
01:11:37,209 --> 01:11:42,379
when the time was right,
but now, it falls to you.

1163
01:11:42,422 --> 01:11:43,631
Me?

1164
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:46,383
Return the crystal.

1165
01:11:48,178 --> 01:11:49,762
Save Atlantis.

1166
01:11:50,305 --> 01:11:51,931
Save my daughter.

1167
01:12:13,245 --> 01:12:15,287
So, what's it going to be?

1168
01:12:16,998 --> 01:12:20,918
- Excuse me?
- I followed you in, and I'll follow you out.

1169
01:12:21,002 --> 01:12:23,420
- It's your decision.
- Oh, my decision?

1170
01:12:23,463 --> 01:12:26,215
Well, I think we've seen
how effective my decisions have been.

1171
01:12:26,258 --> 01:12:27,341
Let's recap.

1172
01:12:27,425 --> 01:12:29,593
I lead a band of plundering vandals

1173
01:12:29,636 --> 01:12:32,137
to the greatest archeological find
in recorded history,

1174
01:12:32,222 --> 01:12:35,683
thus enabling the kidnap
and/or murder of the royal family.

1175
01:12:35,767 --> 01:12:37,434
Not to mention personally delivering

1176
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:40,938
the most powerful force known to man
into the hands of a mercenary nutcase

1177
01:12:40,981 --> 01:12:43,107
who's probably going
to sell it to the Kaiser!

1178
01:12:43,191 --> 01:12:44,859
Have I left anything out?

1179
01:12:45,151 --> 01:12:46,512
Well, you did set the camp on fire

1180
01:12:46,528 --> 01:12:48,696
- and drop us down that big hole.
- Thank you.

1181
01:12:49,239 --> 01:12:50,906
Thank you very much.

1182
01:12:54,786 --> 01:12:57,288
Of course, it's been my experience
when you hit bottom,

1183
01:12:57,789 --> 01:12:59,373
the only place left to go is up.

1184
01:12:59,457 --> 01:13:01,584
Who told you that?

1185
01:13:01,626 --> 01:13:04,378
A fella by the name
of Thaddeus Thatch.

1186
01:13:13,138 --> 01:13:14,388
Where are you going?

1187
01:13:14,639 --> 01:13:17,391
- I'm going after Rourke.
- Milo, that's crazy.

1188
01:13:17,475 --> 01:13:21,270
I didn't say it was the smart thing.
But it is the right thing.

1189
01:13:23,273 --> 01:13:26,859
Come on. We better make sure
he doesn't hurt himself.

1190
01:13:29,029 --> 01:13:31,196
Milo, what do you think you are doing?

1191
01:13:31,281 --> 01:13:32,406
Just follow my lead.

1192
01:13:36,828 --> 01:13:38,996
I'm impressed.

1193
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:40,497
It's simple. All you got to do...

1194
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:41,832
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Shut up. We get it, okay?

1195
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,375
No, no, wait!

1196
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:49,173
Gently. Just gently.

1197
01:13:49,341 --> 01:13:51,884
Hey, Milo, you got something sporty?

1198
01:13:51,968 --> 01:13:53,552
You know, like a tuna?

1199
01:13:53,637 --> 01:13:56,889
- How is this done?
- All you got to do is use the crystals.

1200
01:13:57,015 --> 01:13:58,182
Kida showed me.

1201
01:14:00,477 --> 01:14:03,354
Half-turn right, quarter-turn back.
Keep your hand on the pad.

1202
01:14:06,232 --> 01:14:08,525
Saddle up, partners.
Bring jerky and ammo.

1203
01:14:10,987 --> 01:14:12,821
I'm so excited.

1204
01:14:16,743 --> 01:14:17,952
All right, this is it!

1205
01:14:18,036 --> 01:14:19,536
We're going to rescue the princess.

1206
01:14:19,579 --> 01:14:21,246
We're going to save Atlantis.

1207
01:14:21,331 --> 01:14:24,541
Or we're going to die trying.
Now let's do it!

1208
01:14:47,899 --> 01:14:49,692
I love it when I win.

1209
01:15:06,292 --> 01:15:07,710
Okay, here's the plan.

1210
01:15:07,752 --> 01:15:10,671
We're going to come in low and fast
and take them by surprise.

1211
01:15:10,755 --> 01:15:12,256
Well, I've got news for you, Milo.

1212
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:15,050
Rourke is never surprised,
and he's got a lot of guns.

1213
01:15:15,093 --> 01:15:17,011
Great. Well, do you have
any suggestions?

1214
01:15:17,095 --> 01:15:19,138
Yeah. Don't get shot.

1215
01:15:26,938 --> 01:15:28,188
There they are!

1216
01:15:28,273 --> 01:15:29,565
We've got company!

1217
01:15:32,819 --> 01:15:34,278
Take off!

1218
01:15:42,245 --> 01:15:43,328
Take her up!

1219
01:15:50,795 --> 01:15:52,546
Holy smokes!

1220
01:15:52,630 --> 01:15:54,757
You told me he only had guns.

1221
01:15:54,799 --> 01:15:56,759
What I said was, he's never surprised.

1222
01:16:07,812 --> 01:16:10,064
Okay, now things are getting good.

1223
01:16:10,148 --> 01:16:11,482
Vinny! Heads up!

1224
01:16:11,524 --> 01:16:13,817
We can't let them reach
the top of that shaft!

1225
01:16:30,794 --> 01:16:33,712
Vinny, new plan.
You and me, we're going to be decoys.

1226
01:16:33,797 --> 01:16:37,091
Audrey, Sweet, fly up underneath
that thing and cut her loose.

1227
01:16:37,175 --> 01:16:38,342
We're on it.

1228
01:16:42,138 --> 01:16:43,347
Lieutenant!

1229
01:16:51,856 --> 01:16:54,483
I thought you said this thing could
cut through a femur in 28 seconds!

1230
01:16:54,526 --> 01:16:55,818
Less talk, more saw.

1231
01:17:07,330 --> 01:17:10,374
Looks like somebody's
working overtime.

1232
01:17:13,378 --> 01:17:14,920
Come on, girl. Time's up.

1233
01:17:16,381 --> 01:17:19,633
All right, Milo, this is it.
Any last words?

1234
01:17:20,677 --> 01:17:23,137
Yeah. I really wish I had
a better idea than this!

1235
01:17:28,017 --> 01:17:29,351
We're losing altitude.

1236
01:17:29,394 --> 01:17:30,519
Lighten the load.

1237
01:17:32,063 --> 01:17:34,148
That's it,
unless someone wants to jump.

1238
01:17:34,232 --> 01:17:35,816
Ladies first.

1239
01:17:40,947 --> 01:17:42,865
You said we were in this together!

1240
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:45,576
You promised me a percentage!

1241
01:17:46,536 --> 01:17:48,495
Next time, get it in writing.

1242
01:17:50,665 --> 01:17:52,082
Nothing personal.

1243
01:18:02,218 --> 01:18:05,095
Well, I have to hand it to you.
You're a bigger pain in the neck

1244
01:18:05,138 --> 01:18:07,306
than I would have
ever thought possible.

1245
01:18:09,475 --> 01:18:12,019
I consider myself
an even-tempered man.

1246
01:18:12,103 --> 01:18:14,104
It takes a lot to get under my skin.

1247
01:18:14,189 --> 01:18:18,150
But congratulations,
you just won the solid-gold kewpie doll.

1248
01:18:29,287 --> 01:18:30,746
Nothing personal.

1249
01:18:40,798 --> 01:18:42,466
Tired, Mr. Thatch?

1250
01:18:43,301 --> 01:18:46,136
That's a darn shame

1251
01:18:47,013 --> 01:18:49,973
because I'm just getting warmed up.

1252
01:19:10,828 --> 01:19:12,246
Thank heaven.

1253
01:19:28,846 --> 01:19:30,180
Oh, great!

1254
01:19:44,445 --> 01:19:47,030
The volcano... She awakes!

1255
01:19:47,073 --> 01:19:49,074
Hey, I had nothing to do with it.

1256
01:19:49,158 --> 01:19:50,951
This here would be
a good place not to be.

1257
01:19:51,035 --> 01:19:53,537
No, wait. We got to get her back
or the whole city will die.

1258
01:19:53,621 --> 01:19:55,455
And if we don't get out of here, we'll die.

1259
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:57,040
It's the only way to reverse this.

1260
01:19:57,125 --> 01:19:58,709
Just do it!

1261
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:11,054
Milo, no!

1262
01:20:17,687 --> 01:20:18,729
Go!

1263
01:20:53,806 --> 01:20:57,893
The fissure,
it is about to eject its pyroclastic fury!

1264
01:20:57,935 --> 01:21:00,103
Milo, Mole says the wall's going to blow!

1265
01:24:22,348 --> 01:24:23,557
Milo?

1266
01:25:13,149 --> 01:25:15,609
Atlantis will honor your names forever.

1267
01:25:16,027 --> 01:25:18,028
I only wish there was more
we could do for you.

1268
01:25:18,237 --> 01:25:21,990
You know, thanks anyway,
but I think we're good.

1269
01:25:23,534 --> 01:25:25,327
They'll take you as far as the surface.

1270
01:25:25,369 --> 01:25:27,203
We are really going to miss you, Milo.

1271
01:25:27,246 --> 01:25:29,706
You know, I'm going
to reopen the flower shop,

1272
01:25:29,749 --> 01:25:32,917
and I'm going to think of
you guys every single day,

1273
01:25:33,002 --> 01:25:35,879
Monday through Friday, 9:00 to 5:00,

1274
01:25:35,963 --> 01:25:37,255
Saturday until 2:00.

1275
01:25:37,715 --> 01:25:40,717
Sunday... I'm going to take Sunday off,
probably, and...

1276
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:42,552
Maybe I'll go in for
a couple of hours, you know.

1277
01:25:42,595 --> 01:25:45,096
But August... I'm going to take August.

1278
01:25:45,389 --> 01:25:48,099
I ain't so good at speechifying,

1279
01:25:48,184 --> 01:25:50,310
but I wanted you to have this.

1280
01:25:50,394 --> 01:25:52,520
It's the bacon grease
from the whole trip.

1281
01:25:52,647 --> 01:25:54,230
Cookie, I...

1282
01:25:59,070 --> 01:26:01,237
Two for flinching.

1283
01:26:02,114 --> 01:26:03,156
See you, Milo.

1284
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:05,784
Hey, Milo!

1285
01:26:05,868 --> 01:26:08,036
Mole.

1286
01:26:08,079 --> 01:26:11,247
Mole. Hey, well...

1287
01:26:11,290 --> 01:26:12,499
Good-bye, Mole.

1288
01:26:12,708 --> 01:26:14,167
Now, you sure you want to stay?

1289
01:26:14,251 --> 01:26:16,972
There's a hero's welcome waiting for
the man who discovered Atlantis.

1290
01:26:17,046 --> 01:26:19,506
I don't think
the world needs another hero.

1291
01:26:19,590 --> 01:26:23,051
Besides, I hear there's an opening
down here for an expert in gibberish.

1292
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:25,553
You take good care of
yourself, Milo Thatch.

1293
01:26:25,596 --> 01:26:28,056
Yeah. You, too, Sweet.

1294
01:26:28,099 --> 01:26:29,140
Come here.

1295
01:26:31,268 --> 01:26:33,937
Sweet, before you go, could you...

1296
01:26:33,979 --> 01:26:35,021
No problem.

1297
01:26:35,106 --> 01:26:36,523
Thanks.

1298
01:26:36,607 --> 01:26:38,775
Oh, you're getting a bill.

1299
01:26:38,943 --> 01:26:40,360
Can we go home now?

1300
01:26:40,486 --> 01:26:43,655
Come on, y'all. Let's get
one last shot in front of the fish.

1301
01:26:45,074 --> 01:26:47,450
- Say gochk!
- Gochk!

1302
01:26:53,582 --> 01:26:56,835
Now, let's go over it again,
just so we got it straight.

1303
01:26:57,378 --> 01:27:00,714
- You didn't find anything?
- Nope. Just a lot of rocks...

1304
01:27:00,965 --> 01:27:02,757
And fish, little fish.

1305
01:27:03,551 --> 01:27:04,759
Sponges.

1306
01:27:04,885 --> 01:27:06,177
What happened to Helga?

1307
01:27:06,262 --> 01:27:09,180
Well, we lost her when
a flaming zeppelin come down on her.

1308
01:27:09,557 --> 01:27:12,350
- Missing.
- That's right. And Rourke?

1309
01:27:12,435 --> 01:27:15,186
Nervous breakdown.
You could say he went all to pieces.

1310
01:27:15,271 --> 01:27:18,148
In fact, you could say
he was transamorgafied

1311
01:27:18,232 --> 01:27:19,983
and then busted into a zillion...

1312
01:27:20,025 --> 01:27:22,152
He's missing, too.

1313
01:27:22,194 --> 01:27:24,320
- What about Milo?
- Went down with the sub.

1314
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:31,828
Lord, give me strength.

1315
01:27:32,455 --> 01:27:34,205
I'm going to miss that boy.

1316
01:27:35,166 --> 01:27:37,167
At least he's in a better place now.

1317
01:27:45,593 --> 01:27:47,469
Dear Mr. Whitmore,

1318
01:27:47,511 --> 01:27:49,596
I hope this piece of proof
is enough for you.

1319
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:54,601
It sure convinced me.
Thanks from both of us.

1320
01:29:44,628 --> 01:29:47,964
They'll try to hold you back

1321
01:29:50,134 --> 01:29:54,345
And they will say
you're wrong

1322
01:29:56,098 --> 01:29:59,601
But they will
never understand

1323
01:30:00,227 --> 01:30:03,479
The journey that you're on

1324
01:30:07,067 --> 01:30:10,862
They'll try
to change your mind

1325
01:30:12,823 --> 01:30:15,658
They'll try to change
your heart

1326
01:30:15,743 --> 01:30:17,327
Oh, yeah

1327
01:30:18,412 --> 01:30:22,165
But they will
never understand

1328
01:30:22,458 --> 01:30:24,876
Who you are

1329
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:28,338
And you'll still believe

1330
01:30:28,380 --> 01:30:30,548
Still believe

1331
01:30:30,633 --> 01:30:33,468
And you know
And you know

1332
01:30:33,510 --> 01:30:36,179
You must go
You must go

1333
01:30:36,263 --> 01:30:39,974
Where the dream takes you

1334
01:30:40,017 --> 01:30:41,851
Where you can
take your heart

1335
01:30:41,894 --> 01:30:45,313
Where your heart longs to be

1336
01:30:45,356 --> 01:30:47,690
Your dream will lead you on

1337
01:30:49,276 --> 01:30:52,946
When you finally
find that place

1338
01:30:53,030 --> 01:30:56,991
You'll find all you need

1339
01:30:58,702 --> 01:31:06,584
Where the dream takes you

1340
01:31:06,669 --> 01:31:09,337
Oh, yeah

1341
01:31:11,131 --> 01:31:14,258
There's something
in your soul

1342
01:31:14,343 --> 01:31:17,053
Something in your soul

1343
01:31:17,096 --> 01:31:20,848
That won't be denied

1344
01:31:22,726 --> 01:31:26,229
It's the faith to dream
that keeps

1345
01:31:26,271 --> 01:31:29,023
The dream alive

1346
01:31:29,066 --> 01:31:32,402
So you'll still believe

1347
01:31:32,486 --> 01:31:34,779
Still believe

1348
01:31:34,863 --> 01:31:37,657
And you know

1349
01:31:37,741 --> 01:31:39,826
You must go

1350
01:31:39,910 --> 01:31:44,080
Where the dream takes you

1351
01:31:44,164 --> 01:31:46,207
Where your dream
takes your heart

1352
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:49,585
Where your heart
longs to be

1353
01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:52,005
Your dream will lead you on

1354
01:31:53,424 --> 01:31:57,260
When you finally
find that place

1355
01:31:57,302 --> 01:32:01,389
You'll find all you need

1356
01:32:02,891 --> 01:32:06,269
Where the dream takes you

1357
01:32:06,353 --> 01:32:10,523
Go where your heart
is meant to be

1358
01:32:11,275 --> 01:32:13,776
And you may find

1359
01:32:13,861 --> 01:32:16,612
Somebody there

1360
01:32:16,697 --> 01:32:21,659
Someone to share your dream

1361
01:32:27,458 --> 01:32:31,711
All right, all right
Your dream will lead you on

1362
01:32:32,463 --> 01:32:36,299
When you finally
find that place

1363
01:32:36,341 --> 01:32:40,803
You'll find all you need

1364
01:32:41,305 --> 01:32:45,683
Where the dream leads you

1365
01:32:45,768 --> 01:32:47,685
Your dream will lead you on

1366
01:32:47,770 --> 01:32:51,272
Far as your heart can see

1367
01:32:51,315 --> 01:32:53,149
Your dream will lead you on

1368
01:32:53,233 --> 01:32:54,984
Oh, yes

1369
01:32:55,027 --> 01:32:58,488
There's a world
that waits for you

1370
01:32:58,530 --> 01:33:01,240
You're not alone

1371
01:33:01,325 --> 01:33:04,494
You'll find your home

1372
01:33:04,536 --> 01:33:06,329
Where the dream takes you

1373
01:33:06,371 --> 01:33:08,414
Try to change your mind

1374
01:33:10,042 --> 01:33:11,834
Where the dream takes you

1375
01:33:11,877 --> 01:33:13,878
Try to change your heart

1376
01:33:15,672 --> 01:33:17,840
Where the dream takes you

1377
01:33:17,925 --> 01:33:20,551
But you must go

1378
01:33:21,805 --> 01:34:21,806
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
