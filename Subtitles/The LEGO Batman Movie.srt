- Sounds good to me.

44
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:42,681
- One of us should check it out.
- Okay.

45
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:43,995
Scissors, paper, rock.

46

- Paper.
- Scissors.

47
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:46,415
Ha! You always do paper.

48
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:48,924
I'm a loser at home

- You should be terrified.
- Why?

56
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:19,117
Because I will be taking over the city.

57
00:03:19,325 --> 00:03:20,365
Mmm...

58
00:03:20,577 --> 00:03:22,447
- What?
- Batman will stop you.

59
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,910
He always stops you.

No, he doesn't.

61
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:26,918
What about that time with the two boats?

62
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,793
This is better than the two boats.

63
00:03:29,002 --> 00:03:32,762
- Mmm...
- Well, tonight is gonna be different!

<i>Tonight is my greatest plan yet.</i>

65

<i>And trust me,
Batman's never gonna see it coming.</i>

66
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,310
<i>Like that time with the parade
and the Prince music?</i>

67
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:42,472
<i>Hey, quiet!</i>

68
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,280
- Good night, Steve.
- Take it easy, Jeff.

69
00:03:45,518 --> 00:03:47,098
Man, I really like that guy.

70

00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:17,469
I'm jumping out of the way!

85
00:04:19,427 --> 00:04:21,677
<i>And let's not forget, Clayface.</i>

86

<i>Poison Ivy.</i>

<i>- No!</i>

88
00:04:28,645 --> 00:04:29,645
You freeze!

89
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:30,812
<i>Mr. Freeze!</i>

00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:48,501
Okay, are you making some of those up?

96
00:04:48,665 --> 00:04:50,115
Nope, they're all real.

97
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,711
Probably worth a Google.

98
00:04:54,045 --> 00:04:55,795
- Hey, watch it!
- Commissioner Gordon!

99
00:04:55,964 --> 00:04:56,974
What is it, O'Hara?

100
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:58,131
We just got a report!

101
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,719
All the Z-grade villains have
broken into the energy plant!

102
00:05:00,885 --> 00:05:01,925
What are we gonna do, sir?

103
00:05:02,053 --> 00:05:04,453
The only thing we ever do.
Flip the switch to the Bat-Signal!

104
00:05:04,597 --> 00:05:05,597
Flip!

105
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:07,018
<i>Commissioner, are you there?</i>

106
00:05:07,183 --> 00:05:08,893
The Bat-Signal, she's been egged!

107

<i>It's Egghead, sir.</i>

108
00:05:11,062 --> 00:05:12,562
I'm well aware of his work.

109
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,900
Dear gosh.
You've destroyed the Bat-Signal.

110
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:16,606
You have thought of everything.

111
00:05:16,776 --> 00:05:18,236
Yeah, I know!

112
00:05:18,403 --> 00:05:19,823

<i>Opening reactor core doors.</i>

114

<i>...Batman will grovel at the feet</i>

115

<i>of his greatest enemy!</i>

116
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:29,575
Me! The Joker!

117
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,076
Joker, do you read me?

118
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:34,421
10-4, girl buddy.

119
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:35,875
<i>We're ready for you, sugar plum.</i>

120
00:05:36,045 --> 00:05:38,415
Well, then, let's raise the roof!

121
00:05:39,257 --> 00:05:40,717
Fire in the hole!

122
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:50,163
O'Hara, have you tried the Bat-Phone?

123
00:05:50,268 --> 00:05:52,598
Yes, but all I'm getting
is this hold music.

124
00:05:54,564 --> 00:05:55,614
I love it.

125
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:00,879
- I want snipers trained on that building!
- You bet!

126
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:03,063
- I want water and air support, yesterday!
- Ahoy, sir!

127
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:04,617
And I need SWAT here now!

128
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:05,926
Phone call
for Commissioner Gordon.

129
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:06,950
Hello? Batman?

130
00:06:07,118 --> 00:06:09,658
Hi, Jimmy! It's the Jokes. Oop!

131
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:11,209
Nobody calls you that.

132
00:06:11,414 --> 00:06:13,214
Yes, people do call me that.

133
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:14,384
Okay, listen up.

134
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:15,882
Go, go, go!

135
00:06:16,044 --> 00:06:19,634
<i>At this very moment,
an unnecessarily complicated bomb</i>

136
00:06:19,797 --> 00:06:23,887
<i>is being attached
to the inside of the main energy core.</i>

137
00:06:24,052 --> 00:06:27,722
If the mayor isn't here in five minutes
to negotiate the city's surrender,

138
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:31,599
<i>then I shall destroy Gotham City.</i>

139
00:06:31,768 --> 00:06:33,188
I did something!

140
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:35,942
<i>Doctor, that sounds frightening
and overly complicated.</i>

141
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:37,105
<i>Talk us through it.</i>

142
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:40,938
<i>Well, I don't wanna scare
any small children who may be listening,</i>

143
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,870
<i>but it's a little-known fact
that Gotham City</i>

144
00:06:42,987 --> 00:06:46,317
<i>is built on a bunch of flimsy plates
stuck together.</i>

145
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:48,741
<i>There's literally nothing beneath us,</i>

146
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:52,160
<i>except an infinite abyss
that smells like dirty underwear.</i>

147
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,250
<i>If Joker's bomb were to go off,</i>

148
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:56,325
<i>these plates would break apart,</i>

149
00:06:56,501 --> 00:06:58,131
<i>plunging every Gotham citizen</i>

150
00:06:58,294 --> 00:07:00,844
<i>into the eternal abyss forever.</i>

151
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:02,665
<i>And you wouldn't want that,
now would you?</i>

152
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,590
Now get me the mayor! Joker out!

153
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,470
Madam Mayor,
I cannot ask you to do this!

154
00:07:08,638 --> 00:07:11,178
- Jim, did you find Batman?
- No, ma'am.

155
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:12,849
Then we have no choice.

156
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:17,357
The Joker has the upper hand.
We have to surrender Gotham City.

157
00:07:17,522 --> 00:07:18,822
Oh, no.

158
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:20,731
I'm sorry!

159
00:07:21,651 --> 00:07:23,441
<i>Flying the mayor
package in right now.</i>

160
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:25,781
<i>SWAT team,
get your stun guns ready!</i>

161

Thanks for dropping by.

165

I've only got one thing
to say to you, Joker.

166
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,165
Well, you better make it fast.

Oh, I certainly do.

170

On occasion.

171
00:07:44,924 --> 00:07:46,634
Well, let me give you a word of advice.

I'm all ears.

173

Yes?

<i>Batman!</i>

231

Looks like your plan failed.

232
00:10:01,352 --> 00:10:05,312
Well, it's only a matter of time
before I take over Gotham City.

233
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:13,112
When has that ever happened?

You know why?

236

Because I'm always
one step ahead of you.

237
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,460
And I always get away!

238
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,081
Not this time.

239
00:10:27,837 --> 00:10:28,917

Oh, yeah?

<i>Who's gonna defuse the bomb?</i>

It's gotta be one or the other, Batman.

245
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:42,814
Save the city,
or catch your greatest enemy.

246
00:10:42,977 --> 00:10:43,977
You can't do both.

247
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:45,289
I'm sorry, what did you just say?

248
00:10:45,313 --> 00:10:46,353
You can't do both, I said.

249
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,570
No, I mean the other thing.

250
00:10:47,732 --> 00:10:49,612
Save the city,
or catch your greatest enemy.

251
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:51,175
You think you're my greatest enemy?

252
00:10:51,277 --> 00:10:53,397
Yes! You're obsessed with me!

253
00:10:53,571 --> 00:10:54,701
No, I'm not.

254
00:10:54,864 --> 00:10:56,024
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

255
00:10:56,115 --> 00:10:59,365
Yes, you are! Who else drives you
to one-up them the way that I do?

256
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:00,865
- Bane.
- No, he doesn't!

257
00:11:01,037 --> 00:11:03,117
- Superman.
- Superman's not a bad guy!

258
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:06,169
Then I'd say that I don't
currently have a bad guy.

259
00:11:06,334 --> 00:11:08,594
I am fighting a few different people.

260
00:11:08,753 --> 00:11:09,753
What?

261
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,920
I like to fight around.

262
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:13,628
Okay, look, I'm fine with you
fighting other people

263
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:17,639
if you wanna do that,
but what we have is special.

264
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:19,095
So, when people ask you

265
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:21,103
"Who's your number one bad guy?"
you say...

266
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:22,345
Superman.

267
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,476
Are you seriously saying
that there is nothing,

268
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:27,063
nothing special about our relationship?

269
00:11:27,605 --> 00:11:28,605
Whoa.

270
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:31,404
Let me tell you something, J-bird.

271
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:35,277
- Batman doesn't do 'ships.
- What?

272
00:11:35,446 --> 00:11:37,776
As in "relationships."

273
00:11:38,616 --> 00:11:41,286
<i>There is no "us."</i>

274
00:11:41,452 --> 00:11:44,712

275
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,420

276
00:11:48,376 --> 00:11:50,286
<i>I don't need anyone.</i>

277
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:54,974
You mean nothing to me.

278
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:00,968
No one does.

279
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,330
Hurray! Batman!

322
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:48,137
I'm home.

323
00:14:52,518 --> 00:14:53,688
<i>Welcome home, sir.</i>

324
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:56,692
<i>Initializing Batcave operating system.</i>

325
00:14:59,108 --> 00:15:00,108
Hey, 'Puter.

326
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:03,485
<i>What's up, Batman?</i>

327
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:06,243
Put this bomb in the museum.

328
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:07,407
<i>Certainly, sir.</i>

329
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:10,124
<i>- Thank you.
- No worries.</i>

330
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:12,829
Anything exciting happen
when I was gone?

331
00:15:12,997 --> 00:15:14,367
<i>You have four pieces of mail.</i>

332
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,870
Great, what'd I get?

333
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,881
<i>You have this week's Pennysaver,</i>

334
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:21,013
<i>two bills,
and a coupon for Bed Bath and Beyond.</i>

335
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:23,051
<i>It expires in two weeks.</i>

336
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:26,335
<i>But I've heard that some stores
will honor them past the expiry date.</i>

337
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,510
Copy that.

338
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:31,718
<i>Also, Alfred is on the 17th floor,
grouting tiles in the second bathroom</i>

339
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,270
<i>of the fifth master bedroom.</i>

340
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,063
<i>Do you want me to tell Alfred
you're home?</i>

341
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:38,978
No, that's cool, Computer.
Thanks for the update.

342
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:40,858
I should probably
have some dinner.

343
00:15:41,025 --> 00:15:43,355
<i>Alfred left your lobster thermidor
in the fridge.</i>

344
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:44,527
Oh, that's my favorite.

345
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:46,862
I can't wait.

346
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:08,045
Oh, not 20 minutes. Stupid.

347
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:18,118
Oh, wait.

348
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:20,668
There, which one is, uh...

349
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:22,625
Okay.

350
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,845
<i>You complete me.</i>

351
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,480
<i>Shut up. You had me at hello.</i>

352
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:41,439
Love it!

353
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:21,307
<i>Hey, Mom.</i>

354
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:23,812
<i>Hey, Dad.</i>

355
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,320
I, uh...

356
00:18:26,732 --> 00:18:28,692
I saved the city again today.

357
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:34,279
<i>I wish you could have seen me.</i>

358
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:38,333
I think you would have been
really proud.

359
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:42,158
There you are!

360
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:46,377
Oh! Alfred! I am so sorry.

361
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:47,963
I have incredible reflexes.

362
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:49,548
No, it's all my fault, sir.

363
00:18:49,713 --> 00:18:51,941
I should have known better
than to sneak up on you like that.

364
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:54,545
Sorry, I was just lost in thought,
and as you know,

365
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:56,298
when I'm in there, I'm in deep.

366
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,760
Were you looking
at the old family pictures again?

367
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:01,556
At the what? The old family...

368
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:03,725
Oh, yes! I see what you mean.

369
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:06,274
<i>Look at that! The old gang.</i>

370
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:08,398
Yeah. No, I wasn't.

371
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:10,896
I see.

372
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:14,448
Sir, if you don't mind my saying,
I'm a little concerned.

373
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:20,243
I've seen you go through similar phases
in 2016 and 2012 and 2008 and 2005

374
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:23,410
<i>and 1997 and 1995 and 1992 and 1989</i>

375
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,040
<i>and that weird one in 1966.</i>

376
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:29,999
Do you want to talk about
how you're feeling right now?

377
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,260
I don't talk about feelings, Alfred.

378
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:34,012
I don't have any, I've never seen one.

379
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:36,974
I'm a night-stalking,
crime-fighting vigilante,

380
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:38,795
and a heavy metal rapping machine.

381
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:42,021
I don't feel anything emotionally,
except for rage.

382
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:45,942
24/7, 365, at a million percent.

383
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:48,790
And if you think that there's something
behind that, then you're crazy.

384
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:49,824
Good night, Alfred.

385
00:19:49,982 --> 00:19:51,192
Sir, it's morning.

386
00:19:53,944 --> 00:19:57,954
Master Bruce, you live on an island,
figuratively and literally.

387
00:19:58,115 --> 00:19:59,365
<i>Yeah. I love it.</i>

388
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:01,253
You can't spend
the rest of your life alone,

389
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,540
dressed in black,

390
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:04,963
listening to angry music,
and staying up all night.

391
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:07,622
Yes, I can, 'cause I'm Batman.

392
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:10,841
But don't you think it's time

393
00:20:11,003 --> 00:20:14,053
you finally faced your greatest fear?

394
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:15,224
- Snakes?
- No.

395
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:16,382
- Clowns?
- No.

396
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,630
Snake clowns?

397
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:18,971
Bruce, listen.

398
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:22,183
Your greatest fear is

399
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:25,727
being a part of a family again.

400
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:38,163
Nope. Now it's snake clowns,
because you put that idea in my head.

401
00:20:38,322 --> 00:20:39,742
- Sir?
- Time for push-ups!

402
00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:41,827
One, two... We're going to 1,000.

403
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:43,452
I'm afraid that's not possible, sir.

404
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:45,409
It is possible. I'm already at 20.

405
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:48,329
You're scheduled to go to
Jim Gordon's retirement party.

406
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:51,628
What? No. I don't wanna do that.

407
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:53,753
- You're going to have a great time!
- No, no, no.

408
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:55,045
You might meet some new people!

409
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:56,383
No, no, no!

410
00:20:56,548 --> 00:20:57,775
You could even make some new friends.

411
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:01,469
No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

412
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:03,848
No!

413
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:06,774
And before you go,
we can do your favorite thing.

414
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:09,017
Tuxedo dress-up party.

415
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:20,028
Sir, aren't you forgetting something?

416
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:22,278
- Nope.
- Your cowl.

417
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:23,699
My what, now?

418
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:27,287
Your armored face disguise?

419
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:30,539
Fine.

420
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:34,287
- Happy now?
- Indubitably.

421
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:36,511
Good. Must be nice to be happy.

422
00:21:36,672 --> 00:21:38,922
<i>Tonight, on</i> Metropolis in Focus,

423
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:41,594

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,510
<i>What up, Gotham!</i>

425
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:47,022
<i>Superman, tell me.
How do you feel</i>

426
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:50,192
<i>about your recent banishment
of Zod to the Phantom Zone?</i>

427
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:53,652
<i>Yeah, look, Pippa, it's...
It's complicated. Okay?</i>

428
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:57,784
<i>Zod and I, we've had some
pretty epic battles over the years.</i>

429
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:02,566
<i>I don't believe I would be Superman
without fighting Zod.</i>

430
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:07,119
See? Superman gets it.
Why can't Batman?

431
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:10,865
Check it out, guys.
I built a CD rack. Ta-da!

432
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:14,999
And how am I supposed to get
Batman's respect

433
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:18,128
when I'm working
with these human farts?

434
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:19,916
Boo-boo, look at me.

435
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:23,512
You're too good for Batman.
He needs to open his eyes

436
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:26,097
and see what it feels like
when you're not around. Okay?

437
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:29,273
<i>Yeah, Pippa. I couldn't put Zod
in a regular prison, right?</i>

438
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:30,853
<i>He's Zod. Come on!</i>

439
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:32,636
<i>No, he needed to go someplace</i>

440
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:35,609
<i>where he could never harm
Metropolis ever again.</i>

441
00:22:36,982 --> 00:22:38,232
<i>The Phantom Zone.</i>

442
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,440
<i>Ah, yes, the notorious space jail</i>

443
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,990
<i>that houses the greatest
super-villains of all time.</i>

<i>They've got, like,
the sickest baddies up there.</i>

445
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:47,196
<i>They got, like, this guy.</i>

446
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:49,157
- And her.
<i>- I'll get you, my pretty!</i>

447
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:51,787
<i>- To say nothing about him.</i>
- Wingardium Leviosa!

<i>Exterminate!</i>

450

I'm starting to get an idea,
monkey face.

451
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:04,133
Bruce, over here!

452
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:05,778
Okay, shutterbugs.
Look alive, here we go.

453
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:07,113
I'm gonna give you three poses. You ready?

454
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:08,137
Kissy face.

455
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:09,555
Oops, I did it again.

456
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:11,813
And the Bad Boys. What you gonna do?

457
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:14,135
I'm out of here, guys. Thank you.

<i>- Senator, looking great.

<i>I'm starting with

Bruce, any advice
for the new commissioner?

462
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:26,382
Long as he knows how to push the button
for the Bat-Signal, he'll be fine.

463
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:27,906
Bruce, I don't know how you did it.

464
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:29,555
You can't prove it, you didn't do it.

465
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:31,304
Mr. Wayne, so great to see you!
Come and join us!

466
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,658
Mr. Prime Minister.

467

477
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,640
Call me Bruce, champ.

478
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:56,270
I'm just so jazzed to meet you, sir.

479
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:57,846
I'm sorry, did you say "jazzed"?

480
00:23:58,021 --> 00:23:59,651
Yes! My name's Richard Grayson,

481
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:01,501
but all the kids at the orphanage
call me Dick.

482
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:03,145
- Well, children can be cruel.
- Yeah.

483
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:04,670
- Great to see you, Bruce.
- Nice to see you, sir.

484
00:24:04,694 --> 00:24:07,054
- So, I had a question for you, sir.
- Okay, hit me with it.

485
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:08,915
Do you have any advice
on how to get adopted?

486
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,200
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, you do?

487
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:11,844
- Mr. Wayne, can I get an autograph?
- Sure.

488
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:14,149
Um, all right, for example,
is teeth whitener a good idea?

489
00:24:14,204 --> 00:24:15,564
- Yes. There you go, pal.
- Thanks!

490
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:16,622
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

491
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,470
- Looking good, Bruce.
- Thank you so much.

492
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,340
How about eyeliner
or a foreign language?

493
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:21,882
- Try both.
<i>- Bueno.</i>

494
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:23,335
Look, it's the new commissioner!

495
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:25,525
- Where? Oh, she's with the mayor!
- Okay. Let's see.

496
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:26,799
Here she is, everyone!

497
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:28,387
- Oh, my darling!
- Hi, Dad.

498
00:24:34,015 --> 00:24:35,015
Mr. Wayne?

499
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:38,147
Should I get experimental surgery
to make my eyes larger

500
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:39,691
and more vulnerable-looking?

501
00:24:40,856 --> 00:24:42,396
Uh, do that.

502
00:24:51,158 --> 00:24:52,738
Uh, Mr. Wayne?

503
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:55,159
Are you currently in the market
to adopt a child?

504
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:57,082
- Yeah.
- Really?

505
00:24:57,247 --> 00:24:58,917
- Oh, yeah.
- Wow.

506
00:24:59,082 --> 00:25:00,893
Are you looking for more
of a base model orphan

507
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:03,167
- or one that has more upgraded features?
- Yep.

508
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:04,666
Like cooking or driftwood art?

509
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:06,107
- Gymnastic abilities?
- Yep. Yep.

510
00:25:06,131 --> 00:25:07,801
Close-up street magic à la David Blaine?

511
00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:09,756
- All of it sounds great.
- Really?

512
00:25:09,926 --> 00:25:13,346
Because all of it sounds like me.

513
00:25:13,513 --> 00:25:16,353
Mr. Wayne, do you think you'd be
interested in adopting me

514
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:18,186
as your future orphan son?

515
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:19,351
Definitely.

516
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:20,809
Oh, this is great!

517
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:24,229
Because all I want is to get adopted,
so I can finally stop being

518
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:28,108
alone.

519
00:25:29,321 --> 00:25:30,590
<i>We've gathered here tonight</i>

520
00:25:30,614 --> 00:25:32,784
<i>to mark the retirement of Jim Gordon.</i>

521
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:33,949
Goodbye.

522
00:25:34,117 --> 00:25:38,827
<i>And we wish him well
on his South African jungle safari!</i>

523
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:40,037
Thank you.

524
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:41,960
<i>Now, to introduce you</i>

525
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:44,125
<i>to his exciting new replacement.</i>

526
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:46,884
<i>Everyone, meet your new commissioner!</i>

527
00:25:49,174 --> 00:25:51,434
<i>Meet Barbara Gordon!</i>

528
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:55,813
<i>- The new commissioner of Gotham City!</i>
- Whoa!

529
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:59,482
<i>She was top of her class
at Harvard for Police.</i>

530
00:25:59,643 --> 00:26:03,443
<i>She cleaned up the streets
of Gotham's nearby sister city Blüdhaven</i>

531
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:05,475
<i>using statistics</i>

532
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:07,939
<i>and compassion.</i>

533
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:10,779
<i>And now she's bringing her new ideas</i>

534
00:26:10,946 --> 00:26:14,566
<i>and her nunchucks to Gotham City.</i>

535
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:16,661
Congratulations, darling.

536
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:18,746
- Thanks, Dad.
- Here she is, everyone!

537
00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:20,252
Thank you! Thanks!

538
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:21,623
Hurray!

539
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:22,870
Ms. Gordon, over here!

540
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:24,421
- Big smile!
- Wow.

541
00:26:24,584 --> 00:26:27,254
<i>Thank you for the oversized key
to Arkham Asylum.</i>

542
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,210
<i>And, uh, what's this?</i>

543
00:26:29,381 --> 00:26:32,681
<i>Thank you for the switch
to the Bat-Signal.</i>

544
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:34,052
<i>Nice.</i>

545
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:40,432
<i>Dad, you've always done a great job
protecting Gotham City.</i>

546
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,730
Flip! That's me.

547
00:26:42,894 --> 00:26:45,564
<i>Thank you.
Along with Batman, of course.</i>

548
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,190
Whoo! Let's hear it for Batman!

549
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:48,977
<i>Who I wish was here right now.</i>

550
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,690
Oh, I'm sure he's listening.

551
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,530
<i>I'd like to ask all of you a question.</i>

552
00:26:52,696 --> 00:26:54,696
<i>Are you fed up with crime?</i>

553
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:57,260
- Uh-huh. We're all tired of crime.
- Yeah, we're sick of it.

554
00:26:57,284 --> 00:26:59,544
<i>Great. Then let's talk about
real improvements</i>

555
00:26:59,703 --> 00:27:01,543
<i>that will end the cycle of crime.</i>

556
00:27:01,871 --> 00:27:05,291
<i>I've got a four-point pilot program
that I'd love to share with you.</i>

557
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:07,038
I wanna hear all four points.

558
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:08,380
<i>- It's called...</i>
- I am ready.

559
00:27:08,545 --> 00:27:09,545
<i>It takes a village...</i>

560
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:10,923
Best opening to a title ever.

561
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:12,589
<i>Not a Batman.</i>

562
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:14,383
- Waiter.
- Sir?

563
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:15,551
- Can I?
- Of course.

564
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:16,889
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

565
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:18,053
Thanks so much.

566
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,980
- What?
<i>- Look.</i>

567
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:26,062
<i>Batman's been on the job
for a very, very, very,</i>

568
00:27:26,229 --> 00:27:29,569
<i>very, very, very, very, very long time.</i>

569
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:31,403
He has aged phenomenally.

570
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:35,568
<i>However, despite all the great work
Batman has done for us,</i>

571
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:40,409
<i>Gotham City is still the most
crime-ridden city in the world.</i>

572
00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:41,804
- She's got a great point.
- Interesting.

573
00:27:41,828 --> 00:27:43,708
Historically speaking, that is accurate.

574
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:45,766
<i>- He hasn't captured Riddler.
- You know, she's right.</i>

575
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:46,880
<i>He hasn't captured Bane.</i>

576
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:48,962
- Huh!
<i>- Or Catwoman.</i>

577
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:53,087
<i>Or Two-Face,
or any of Gotham's other villains!</i>

578
00:27:53,256 --> 00:27:54,256
He's not good at his job.

579
00:27:54,424 --> 00:27:55,884
<i>Including the Joker!</i>

580
00:27:56,051 --> 00:27:57,931
She's making a lot of sense.

581
00:27:58,178 --> 00:27:59,758
Excuse me. I'm so sorry. Excuse me.

582
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:01,389
<i>We love you, Barbara!</i>

583
00:28:01,598 --> 00:28:03,348
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Hi. Bruce Wayne.

584
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:05,936
Billionaire, bon vivant,
gallivanter, playboy,

585
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:08,772
Gotham's most eligible bachelor,
like, 90 years in a row.

586
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:10,958
<i>- That's me right there.
- I know who you are, Mr. Wayne.</i>

587
00:28:10,982 --> 00:28:15,112
You bet you do. Quick quest,
what is your problem with Batman,

588
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:17,608
and also, what the heck, dude?

589
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:19,241
<i>I'm glad you asked, Mr. Wayne.</i>

590
00:28:19,407 --> 00:28:21,447
<i>I'm not a Batman hater.</i>

591
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:24,038
<i>But we don't need
an unsupervised adult man</i>

592
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:26,834
<i>karate-chopping poor people
in a Halloween costume.</i>

593
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:29,787
<i>We need to take
what's good about Batman...</i>

594
00:28:30,001 --> 00:28:34,551
<i>...and marry it to actual laws
and proper ethics</i>

595
00:28:34,714 --> 00:28:35,884
<i>and accountability.</i>

596
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:37,579
I hate everything you just said.

597
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:42,564
<i>Because my dream is for the police force
to team up with Batman.</i>

598
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:43,722
Waiter.

599
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,640
<i>Wouldn't that be better?</i>

600
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:49,019
<i>And I know that, together,
the world's greatest detective...</i>

601
00:28:49,687 --> 00:28:51,607
<i>...and Gotham's finest</i>

602
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:53,815
<i>could clean up
these crime-ridden streets.</i>

603
00:28:56,152 --> 00:28:57,282
<i>Forever.</i>

604
00:28:57,445 --> 00:28:58,905
Everybody, get down!

605
00:29:01,324 --> 00:29:03,334
Grand entrance!

606
00:29:03,827 --> 00:29:06,287
<i>Everyone! Make your way
to the exits immediately!</i>

607
00:29:06,496 --> 00:29:07,706
Run!

608
00:29:07,872 --> 00:29:09,832
Team Bane, block the exits.

609
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:11,249
Going somewhere?

610
00:29:11,501 --> 00:29:14,211
Clayface, Freeze, bring me
the new Commissioner Gordon.

611
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:16,009
- We're on it.
- Cool.

612
00:29:16,172 --> 00:29:17,882
And, Harley, you know what to do.

613
00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:19,049
I sure do.

614
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:22,799
It's time for Operation
"Take Out the Laundry."

615
00:29:23,054 --> 00:29:25,974
Butler One, this is Bat One.
Do you copy?

616
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:28,982
- Go ahead, Bat One.
<i>- I need my armored face disguise, now!</i>

617
00:29:29,144 --> 00:29:30,384
Only if you say the magic word.

618
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,600
- Now!
<i>- No.</i>

619
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:34,521
- You're fired.
- No. Sir, we'll talk about this

620
00:29:34,691 --> 00:29:35,731
back at the Batcave.

621
00:29:38,027 --> 00:29:39,067
- Hey, 'Puter.
<i>- Yes?</i>

622
00:29:39,237 --> 00:29:40,947
Initialize masterbuild music.

623
00:29:41,114 --> 00:29:42,284
<i>Right away.</i>

624
00:29:42,949 --> 00:29:46,039
<i>Collateral damage assessment
suggests the Scuttler, sir.</i>

625
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:47,332
Good plan.

626
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:54,208
Madam Mayor, stay close to me.

627
00:29:54,377 --> 00:29:55,377
Head for the south exit.

628
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,010
Now, ma'am.

629
00:29:59,132 --> 00:30:00,132
Go! Go! Go!

630
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,720
Honey, let Batman take care of it.

631
00:30:01,885 --> 00:30:03,215
Dad, I got this.

632
00:30:15,565 --> 00:30:17,065
<i>Scuttler online.</i>

633
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:19,363
Chief O'Hara, we're coming in hot!

634
00:30:19,527 --> 00:30:21,027
I'm almost there.

635
00:30:25,575 --> 00:30:27,115
Chief, get the mayor to safety.

636
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:30,544
Computer,
I've got the Joker in my sights.

637
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:32,745
Team, I got the Joker in my sights.

638
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:38,253
Joker!

639
00:30:38,421 --> 00:30:39,421
Joker.

640
00:30:39,589 --> 00:30:41,169
Uh, excuse me? I was about to...

641
00:30:41,341 --> 00:30:44,091
Push the Bat-Signal? Good call.
I like your instincts.

642
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,220
I've got a surprise for you guys.

643
00:30:46,387 --> 00:30:48,427
And it's gonna make you smile.

644
00:30:48,598 --> 00:30:50,598
Uh-oh! His smile is our grimace.

645
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:51,767
<i>Everybody, get down.</i>

646
00:30:51,935 --> 00:30:53,685
- I...
- Joker, no!

647
00:30:54,604 --> 00:30:55,774
...surrender.

648
00:30:56,147 --> 00:30:57,607
What?

649
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:00,396
Uh, what did you just say?

650
00:31:00,568 --> 00:31:03,818
I said, "I surrender."

651
00:31:03,988 --> 00:31:05,108
Joker, what are you doing?

652
00:31:05,448 --> 00:31:07,208
I'm sorry, my Bat-ears
must be malfunctioning

653
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:08,367
because it sounds...

654
00:31:08,535 --> 00:31:09,535
I surrender!

655
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:12,122
Okay, you know what? Cool it.
You're a criminal.

656
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:14,328
You run, and I catch you.

657
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:15,789
Not anymore, Batman.

658
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:17,999
You were right. There is no "us."

659
00:31:18,169 --> 00:31:21,459
So, there's no point
in me trying to fight you anymore.

660
00:31:21,631 --> 00:31:23,971
Therefore, I will be surrendering myself

661
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:26,843
to our strong-willed and
forward-thinking new commissioner.

662
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:28,697
Blink, blink, blink.
Blinkety blink, blink, blink!

663
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:29,721
That's really suspicious.

664
00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:32,099
Yeah, it is. What are you up to, Joker?

665
00:31:32,267 --> 00:31:34,727
I just wanna go to Arkham
and pay for all of my crimes.

666
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:36,622
Blink, blink, blink.
Blinkety blink, blink, blink!

667
00:31:36,646 --> 00:31:38,686
Are you actually saying "blink"?

668
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:40,146
No! Blink, blink, blink.

669
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:41,316
<i>Joker! That's enough.</i>

670
00:31:41,484 --> 00:31:43,034
Okay, Babs. I got this.

671
00:31:43,194 --> 00:31:46,664
Not so fast, Batman.
You can't fight me anymore.

672
00:31:46,823 --> 00:31:47,823
I'm off the market.

673
00:31:47,991 --> 00:31:49,701
What are you talking about?

674
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:51,697
I'm off the menu.

675
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:54,659
You won't get to fight
any of this anymore.

676
00:31:54,998 --> 00:31:56,668
Man, am I sorry I asked.

677
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:59,673
Anyway, have fun in jail and...

678
00:31:59,836 --> 00:32:01,046
Batman, what are you doing?

679
00:32:01,296 --> 00:32:03,046
Punching Bane.

680
00:32:03,214 --> 00:32:04,844
That was unnecessary.

681
00:32:05,008 --> 00:32:07,298
Oh, no, you can't fight Bane
anymore either.

682
00:32:07,468 --> 00:32:08,548
Really?

683
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,680
Yeah. Or Riddler.

684
00:32:10,847 --> 00:32:12,347
Or Catwoman. Or Condiment King.

685
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:14,099
Why not?

686
00:32:14,267 --> 00:32:18,017
Because we're all surrendering.
Right, guys?

687
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:19,187
We are?

688
00:32:19,355 --> 00:32:20,475
Yes!

689
00:32:27,989 --> 00:32:30,529
<i>Riddle me this.
What just happened?</i>

690
00:32:30,908 --> 00:32:32,368
It's the end of crime!

691
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:33,910
All right!

692
00:32:34,037 --> 00:32:35,222
- That was amazing!
- Over here, over here!

693
00:32:35,246 --> 00:32:37,326
- You did it!
- Yeah, of course I did. I'm...

694
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:40,080
Sorry, not you.
We're talking to Commissioner Gordon.

695
00:32:40,251 --> 00:32:42,211
- Well, it was a team effort.
- I got this, Babs.

696
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:43,758
Commissioner, how do you feel?

697
00:32:43,921 --> 00:32:46,011
Amazing! This is a great first day.

698
00:32:46,174 --> 00:32:47,344
Okay.

699
00:32:47,508 --> 00:32:48,718
- Question for Batman.
- Shoot.

700
00:32:48,885 --> 00:32:50,404
What are you gonna do
with the rest of your life?

701
00:32:50,428 --> 00:32:51,968
What do you mean,
the rest of my life?

702
00:32:52,138 --> 00:32:55,018
We don't need a vigilante crime fighter
now that there's no more crime.

703
00:32:55,183 --> 00:32:56,233
Uh, yes, you do.

704
00:32:56,392 --> 00:32:58,812
You can spend some quality time
with your family.

705
00:32:59,771 --> 00:33:00,771
My...

706
00:33:05,485 --> 00:33:07,945
Okay, Batman. We'll take it from here.

707
00:33:08,112 --> 00:33:09,242
All right, listen up.

708
00:33:09,405 --> 00:33:11,695
All of you have
the right to remain silent.

709
00:33:11,866 --> 00:33:12,906
Let's roll out!

710
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:14,076
Toodle-oo, Batman!

711
00:33:14,243 --> 00:33:15,603
- Bye, Batman.
<i>- Au revoir,</i> Batman.

712
00:33:15,745 --> 00:33:16,745
<i>Bye, Batman.</i>

713
00:33:16,913 --> 00:33:18,253
<i>Bye, Batman!</i>

714
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:26,921
<i>Today is a victory</i>

715
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:30,260
<i>for the citizens of Gotham City!</i>

716
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:34,104
No more crime!
No more crime! No more crime!

717
00:33:34,263 --> 00:33:37,273
No more crime! No more crime!
No more crime!

718
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:40,733
No more crime! No more crime!
No more crime!

719
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:45,777
Is everything okay, sir?

720
00:33:45,942 --> 00:33:47,702
You've barely touched
your lobster thermidor.

721
00:33:47,777 --> 00:33:50,777
I don't have time to eat
lobster thermidor right now!

722
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:55,790
Warrior two.

723
00:33:55,952 --> 00:33:58,832
Pigeon pose. Tree pose.

724
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,130
Tree pose.

725
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:05,343
Hey, Batman!

726
00:34:05,503 --> 00:34:06,673
Barbara!

727
00:34:06,838 --> 00:34:07,838
What are you doing?

728
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:09,795
Nothing. I have a very full life.

729
00:34:09,966 --> 00:34:12,466
No, I mean, what are you doing here?

730
00:34:12,635 --> 00:34:15,805
Surveillance. On the Joker.

731
00:34:15,972 --> 00:34:18,892
Batman, we both know
the Joker's up to something.

732
00:34:19,058 --> 00:34:21,728
Well, then we can't just let him
run around loose in a prison.

733
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:23,154
He's not loose.

734
00:34:23,312 --> 00:34:25,482
He has to go someplace outside the law.

735
00:34:25,648 --> 00:34:27,318
- Outside the law?
- Yeah.

736
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:29,485
Somewhere like, uh...

737
00:34:29,652 --> 00:34:32,742
Hi, there. I'm here
from Phantom's Own Laundry.

738
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:34,865
Here to take that bad stuff
off your hands.

739
00:34:35,032 --> 00:34:37,662
Wait, that's it! The Phantom Zone.

740
00:34:37,827 --> 00:34:39,657
The Phantom Zone? No way!

741
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:43,419
That is super illegal
and way outside our jurisdiction.

742
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:47,041
So, why don't you and I work together

743
00:34:47,211 --> 00:34:49,711
inside the law,
to figure out what he's up to?

744
00:34:49,881 --> 00:34:52,681
Batman works alone.
That's my motto. Copyright Batman.

745
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:58,100
Batman, there are no more vigilantes
allowed in Gotham City.

746
00:34:58,264 --> 00:34:59,724
Okay. Totally got it.

747
00:34:59,891 --> 00:35:03,351
Then I have to go into
double-secret super vigilante mode.

748
00:35:03,895 --> 00:35:05,895
You said that out loud.

749
00:35:06,522 --> 00:35:09,402
I know that she said I said that out loud,
but there's no way I did.

750
00:35:09,567 --> 00:35:12,527
She has no idea what's going on
in my super-mind.

751
00:35:12,695 --> 00:35:14,355
Super-mind?

752
00:35:14,614 --> 00:35:15,954
Smoke bomb!

753
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:23,710
Computer, how do I put the Joker
in the Phantom Zone?

754
00:35:23,873 --> 00:35:25,963
Quickest route, no freeways.

755
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,460
'Puter, do you hear me?

756
00:35:32,965 --> 00:35:34,625
Hello, Master Bruce.

757
00:35:34,801 --> 00:35:37,361
Alfred, there's something wrong
with the Batcomputer. Watch this.

758
00:35:37,512 --> 00:35:39,222
'Puter. Nothing.

759
00:35:39,388 --> 00:35:41,138
'Puter. Do you see what I'm saying?

760
00:35:41,307 --> 00:35:42,659
There's nothing wrong with it, sir.

761
00:35:42,683 --> 00:35:45,273
I have just taken away
your computer privileges.

762
00:35:48,189 --> 00:35:49,979
The parental lock? You can't do that.

763
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:52,359
Oh, I can. I've been reading

764
00:35:52,527 --> 00:35:54,897
<i>Setting Limits
for Your Out-of-Control Child.</i>

765
00:35:55,071 --> 00:35:56,271
You know what? Doesn't matter,

766
00:35:56,322 --> 00:35:58,042
'cause I have
a double-secret super password

767
00:35:58,157 --> 00:35:59,657
that unlocks the parental lock.

768
00:35:59,826 --> 00:36:03,116
You mean, "Alfred da Butt-ler,"
with two T's?

769
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,960
Sir, it's time for you
to stop this unhealthy behavior.

770
00:36:07,124 --> 00:36:08,584
No, it's not.

771
00:36:08,751 --> 00:36:10,437
You need to take responsibility
for your life.

772
00:36:10,461 --> 00:36:11,921
Not right now, I don't.

773
00:36:12,088 --> 00:36:14,718
And it starts by raising your son.

774
00:36:17,969 --> 00:36:18,969
I'm sorry.

775
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:21,926
I literally have no idea
what you're talking about.

776
00:36:22,098 --> 00:36:25,058
The young orphan you adopted
at the gala. Remember?

777
00:36:27,353 --> 00:36:30,363
<i>Wow! Stairs. Whee!</i>

778
00:36:30,773 --> 00:36:32,983
He's been living here for the past week.

779
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,780
<i>Hello, table! Boom!</i>

780
00:36:36,028 --> 00:36:39,568
<i>And I must say,
I've grown rather fond of the young lad.</i>

781
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,660
<i>Hello, secret camera.</i>

782
00:36:41,826 --> 00:36:42,906
<i>You should get to know him.</i>

783
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:44,575
<i>We are family</i>

784
00:36:44,745 --> 00:36:47,285
<i>- You and he have a lot in common.
- En garde.</i>

785
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:50,958
Hello, family photos.

786
00:36:51,127 --> 00:36:53,547
<i>He lost his parents
at a very young age.</i>

787
00:36:55,172 --> 00:36:56,922
I've always wanted one of those.

788
00:36:59,093 --> 00:37:03,063
Doesn't he deserve a chance for someone
to take him under their wing,

789
00:37:04,098 --> 00:37:07,308
as I took you under mine?

790
00:37:10,438 --> 00:37:13,148
Alfred, you've been watching
way too many Lifetime movies

791
00:37:13,316 --> 00:37:14,316
and drinking chardonnay.

792
00:37:14,483 --> 00:37:16,163
- It's Pinot grigio, sir.
- Whatever it is.

793
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:18,275
Listen, you don't have a family.

794
00:37:18,487 --> 00:37:19,857
You're satisfied serving me.

795
00:37:20,531 --> 00:37:22,871
<i>So what do you know about
having a surrogate son?</i>

796
00:37:23,451 --> 00:37:25,081
<i>Now, I'm gonna go fight crime</i>

797
00:37:25,244 --> 00:37:28,164
while you put that kid on the next jet
to the orphanage. Got it?

798
00:37:29,999 --> 00:37:31,129
As you wish, sir.

799
00:37:32,835 --> 00:37:34,245
Whoops-a-daisy.

800
00:37:35,796 --> 00:37:36,876
<i>Wait, what are you doing?</i>

801
00:37:37,048 --> 00:37:38,048
Dusting.

802
00:37:38,215 --> 00:37:39,401
You can't let him into the Batcave!

803
00:37:39,425 --> 00:37:42,545
I'm not. I'm letting him into your life

804
00:37:42,762 --> 00:37:44,262
via the Batcave.

805
00:37:54,273 --> 00:37:55,273
What?

806
00:37:56,901 --> 00:37:58,951
It's the Batcave!

807
00:37:59,362 --> 00:38:01,862
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

808
00:38:02,031 --> 00:38:04,031
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

809
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,740
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

810
00:38:09,372 --> 00:38:11,542
Batman! Whoa!

811
00:38:11,707 --> 00:38:12,877
You're darn right, "Whoa."

812
00:38:13,042 --> 00:38:15,382
Wait, does Batman live
in Bruce Wayne's basement?

813
00:38:15,544 --> 00:38:17,714
No. Bruce Wayne lives in Batman's attic.

814
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,970
- We can have sleepovers every night!
- No, we can't.

815
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:22,332
- Wow! Look, it's the Bat-Sub!
- Wait, don't touch that!

816
00:38:22,385 --> 00:38:23,737
Over there, it's the Bat-Space shuttle.

817
00:38:23,761 --> 00:38:24,905
Please, keep your hands off that.

818
00:38:24,929 --> 00:38:26,531
- Look, it's the Bat-Zeppelin!
- Don't touch that either!

819
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:27,595
- It's the Bat-Train!
- No!

820
00:38:27,723 --> 00:38:28,893
- It's the Bat-Kayak.
<i>- No!</i>

821
00:38:29,058 --> 00:38:30,202
- It's the Bat-Dune buggy.
<i>- No!</i>

822
00:38:30,226 --> 00:38:32,056
It's the Bat shark repellent?

823
00:38:33,896 --> 00:38:36,896
Uh, actually, you can touch that.
It's completely useless.

824
00:38:37,066 --> 00:38:38,396
Whoa! Thanks, Batman!

825
00:38:38,609 --> 00:38:40,779
Please, stand over there.

826
00:38:40,945 --> 00:38:43,485
And don't touch, look at, or do anything

827
00:38:43,656 --> 00:38:45,550
for the remaining moments
you have in my presence.

828
00:38:45,574 --> 00:38:46,584
Okay, cool.

829
00:38:46,742 --> 00:38:48,202
- Computer.
<i>- Go ahead.</i>

830
00:38:48,369 --> 00:38:50,499
How do I put the Joker
in the Phantom Zone?

831
00:38:50,663 --> 00:38:52,753
<i>Joker can only be put in the Phantom Zone</i>

832
00:38:52,915 --> 00:38:54,455
<i>using the Phantom Zone Projector.</i>

833

<i>However, only a person that isn't

837
00:39:05,011 --> 00:39:06,221
<i>can enter the cauldron.</i>

838
00:39:06,429 --> 00:39:08,099
Ugh, I'm way too buff.

839
00:39:08,264 --> 00:39:10,024
<i>You also have beautiful abs, sir.</i>

840
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:11,562
That's my cross to bear.

841
00:39:11,726 --> 00:39:13,846
<i>Additionally, once inside the cauldron,</i>

842

<i>Chance of total mission failure is 110%.</i>

846
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:26,621
Those are not great odds.

847
00:39:26,782 --> 00:39:27,782
Wait a minute.

848
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,120
- Hey, kid.
- Yes, sir?

849
00:39:29,285 --> 00:39:30,945
- You're super nimble, right?
- I sure am!

850
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,200
- And small?
- Very.

851
00:39:32,371 --> 00:39:34,041
- And quiet?
- When I desire to be.

852
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:36,126
And 110% expendable?

853
00:39:36,292 --> 00:39:38,042
I don't know what that means,
but okay.

854
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,800
Great. Follow me.

855
00:39:39,962 --> 00:39:42,802
We are gonna steal
the Phantom Zone Projector from Superman.

856
00:39:42,965 --> 00:39:43,965
- Steal?
- Yeah.

857
00:39:44,133 --> 00:39:45,723
We have to right a wrong.

858
00:39:45,885 --> 00:39:48,795
And, sometimes, in order to right a wrong,
you have to do a wrong-right.

859
00:39:48,971 --> 00:39:49,971
Gandhi said that.

860
00:39:50,139 --> 00:39:51,389
Are we sure Gandhi said that?

861
00:39:51,557 --> 00:39:53,227
- I'm paraphrasing.
- Cool!

Wow! Look at all these!

864
00:39:57,063 --> 00:39:58,623
Do I get a costume for the mission, too?

865
00:39:58,647 --> 00:40:01,107
I got a feeling that you'll just look
like a kid on Halloween.

866
00:40:01,317 --> 00:40:02,317
Don't you think?

867
00:40:02,526 --> 00:40:03,566
Don't touch that.

868
00:40:03,778 --> 00:40:05,818
Whoo-hoo!

869
00:40:05,988 --> 00:40:07,132
<i>- El Mariachi.

00:40:19,835 --> 00:40:21,035
How do we feel about this one?

880
00:40:21,087 --> 00:40:23,007
Dress-up parties are for grown-ups only.

881
00:40:23,172 --> 00:40:24,342
Wait. What's that one there?

882
00:40:24,507 --> 00:40:25,901
<i>That one was for

<i>The locals called me Reggae Man.</i>

885
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:30,600
I love it!

886
00:40:30,763 --> 00:40:32,603
Ah! Feels like I was poured into this.

887
00:40:32,765 --> 00:40:33,845
My only trouble is,

888
00:40:34,433 --> 00:40:36,023
these pants are just a little tight.

889
00:40:36,185 --> 00:40:38,305
I don't know if I could throw a kick
or jump in them.

890
00:40:38,479 --> 00:40:41,149
I got an idea. Rip! That's better!

891
00:40:41,315 --> 00:40:42,685
Now I'm free, now I'm moving.

892
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:44,858
Come on, Batman. Let's get grooving!

893
00:40:45,111 --> 00:40:47,071
I can only look you
in the eyes right now.

894
00:40:47,238 --> 00:40:49,698
- Sir, what are you doing?
- What do you mean?

895
00:40:49,949 --> 00:40:52,079
Why is Master Dick dressed like that?

896
00:40:52,284 --> 00:40:55,874
How dare you tell me
how to parent my kid I just met?

897
00:40:56,038 --> 00:40:57,038
To the Batmobile!

898
00:40:57,206 --> 00:40:58,366
Hot-diggity-dog!

899
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:03,050
<i>Vehicle rotisserie engaged.</i>

<i>Retrieving the Speedwagon.</i>

<i>Turbines to speed.</i>

903
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:11,600
Hey, kid. Let's go.

904
00:41:12,221 --> 00:41:13,891
- Oh, shoot!
- What?

905
00:41:14,598 --> 00:41:16,558
I probably shouldn't leave

906
00:41:16,725 --> 00:41:20,395
until I get the thumbs up
from my new old man, Bruce Wayne.

907
00:41:21,981 --> 00:41:24,191
Uh, yeah. Here's the thing.

908
00:41:26,068 --> 00:41:28,448
Bruno and I decided

909
00:41:28,612 --> 00:41:30,532
to share custody of you.

910
00:41:30,698 --> 00:41:32,658
So I get a say

911
00:41:32,825 --> 00:41:34,945
and you're mission approved.

912
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,199
No way! Is this really happening?

913
00:41:37,371 --> 00:41:38,461
Yeah.

914
00:41:38,706 --> 00:41:39,746
Whoo-hoo!

915
00:41:39,957 --> 00:41:41,377
A month ago, I had no dads.

916
00:41:41,542 --> 00:41:43,542
Then I had one dad. Now I have two dads!

917
00:41:43,711 --> 00:41:45,841
- And one of them is Batman!
- Yeah.

918
00:41:46,005 --> 00:41:47,335
<i>It's raining dads!</i>

919
00:41:47,506 --> 00:41:48,506
So,

920
00:41:48,674 --> 00:41:50,724
are you ready to follow Batman

921
00:41:50,885 --> 00:41:53,795
and maybe learn a few
life lessons along the way?

922
00:41:53,971 --> 00:41:55,391
I sure am, Dad Two!

923
00:41:55,556 --> 00:41:57,306
But first, where's the seatbelt?

924
00:41:57,474 --> 00:41:59,024
The first lesson is,

925
00:41:59,185 --> 00:42:01,095
life doesn't give you seatbelts!

926
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:03,270
- Let's go!
- Whoo-hoo!

927
00:42:03,522 --> 00:42:04,772
<i>Yes!</i>

928
00:42:06,442 --> 00:42:08,032
<i>Faster, Dad! Faster!</i>

929
00:42:08,986 --> 00:42:09,986
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

930
00:42:10,154 --> 00:42:11,164
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

931
00:42:11,322 --> 00:42:12,362
Yes, yes, yes!

932
00:42:14,116 --> 00:42:16,616
Oh! Oh, my goodness.
I am so sorry.

933
00:42:16,785 --> 00:42:18,575
Get back up in that seat. There you go.

934
00:42:18,746 --> 00:42:20,746
Hey, listen.
As soon as I get back to the Batcave,

935
00:42:20,915 --> 00:42:23,415
I'll make sure that
Alfred puts seatbelts on there, okay?

936
00:42:23,584 --> 00:42:26,594
But for the time being,
I'm just gonna put my arm right here.

937
00:42:26,795 --> 00:42:29,875
<i>And we're just gonna
gently ease out of here.</i>

938
00:42:30,049 --> 00:42:32,009
<i>And here we go.</i>

939
00:42:44,939 --> 00:42:47,189
Okay. Like all superheroes,

940
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:49,898
Superman has zero friends,
and he spends most of his time

941
00:42:50,069 --> 00:42:53,949
basking in sweet, sweet isolation,
here at his alone palace.

942
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,620
So, I'll keep him busy

943
00:42:55,783 --> 00:42:58,583
while you sneak into that vent
and get the Projector. Got it?

944
00:42:58,744 --> 00:43:00,584
Copy that! Oh, here's an idea.
I could also...

945
00:43:00,746 --> 00:43:01,890
Whoa, whoa.
Don't even finish that thought.

946
00:43:01,914 --> 00:43:04,834
See this counter?
These are all the good ideas Batman has.

947
00:43:05,251 --> 00:43:07,881
And no one else has ever had
any good ideas. So don't even try.

948
00:43:08,045 --> 00:43:09,625
Your super power...

949
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:12,508
...is excellent listening
and execution of my ideas.

950
00:43:12,675 --> 00:43:14,425
- Let's try it out.
- Cool!

951
00:43:14,593 --> 00:43:16,433
Drop to the ground. Do a backflip.

952
00:43:16,595 --> 00:43:18,135
Do a front flip. Triple Axel.

953
00:43:18,305 --> 00:43:20,635
Plié. Relevé. Jeté.
Pythagorean theorem.

954
00:43:20,808 --> 00:43:22,160
A squared plus B squared equals C squared.

955
00:43:22,184 --> 00:43:23,194
Physicalize it!

956
00:43:23,352 --> 00:43:25,442
A squared plus B squared

957
00:43:25,604 --> 00:43:27,364
equals C squared.

958
00:43:27,606 --> 00:43:28,750
- How'd I do, Dad?
- Mediocre.

959
00:43:28,774 --> 00:43:29,784
Yes!

960
00:43:29,942 --> 00:43:31,692
And don't call me "Dad."
Now, begin mission.

961
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:32,860
Yes, Papa.

962
00:43:33,028 --> 00:43:35,278
"Papa" falls into the "Dad" category.

963
00:43:53,173 --> 00:43:54,343
'Sup, Supes?

964
00:43:54,508 --> 00:43:56,968
Wow. It's Batman.

965
00:43:57,136 --> 00:43:59,006
And he's at my house.

966
00:43:59,179 --> 00:44:00,219
Right now.

967
00:44:00,431 --> 00:44:01,771
What are you doing here?

968
00:44:01,932 --> 00:44:04,892
Don't worry about it, dawg.
I'm not here to throw down or anything.

969
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,600
Uh, no, I would crush you.

970
00:44:06,854 --> 00:44:09,364
Okay. Sure, sure, sure.

971
00:44:09,523 --> 00:44:11,323
Hey, listen. Thank me later,

972
00:44:11,483 --> 00:44:13,073
but I just happened to be in the hood.

973
00:44:13,235 --> 00:44:16,065
And I figured that you could
probably use the...

974
00:44:18,532 --> 00:44:20,582
...company.

975
00:44:22,494 --> 00:44:24,254
Wait a minute.

976
00:44:24,663 --> 00:44:26,333
Are you... Are you having

977
00:44:26,582 --> 00:44:30,422
the "57th Annual Justice
League Anniversary Party"

978
00:44:30,669 --> 00:44:32,839
- without me?
- No.

979
00:44:33,005 --> 00:44:34,625
No! No! No!

980
00:44:34,798 --> 00:44:37,548
No! There must have been
some mistake with the email.

981
00:44:37,718 --> 00:44:38,758
That's crazy, man.

982
00:44:38,927 --> 00:44:41,887
Totally! Yes, email mistakes
happen all the time.

983
00:44:42,056 --> 00:44:44,346
Sometimes I don't get
Superman's emails for

984
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,100
years.

985
00:44:46,268 --> 00:44:47,768
Great point, G.L. Great point.

986
00:44:47,936 --> 00:44:49,581
All right.
Well, that clears up everything, right?

987
00:44:49,605 --> 00:44:50,605
Enjoy the party, bro.

988
00:44:50,773 --> 00:44:52,943
Hit it, DJ Wonder Dog.

989
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:56,450
<i>I'm Superman at the super party</i>

990
00:44:56,653 --> 00:44:58,163
<i>I'm Superman at the super party</i>

991
00:44:58,322 --> 00:44:59,322
<i>Hey-hey</i>

992
00:45:00,449 --> 00:45:02,369
Hey, Batman.
Do you wanna take a quick pic?

993
00:45:02,534 --> 00:45:03,874
Sure. Where do you want me?

994
00:45:04,036 --> 00:45:05,036
Right there is perfect.

995
00:45:05,204 --> 00:45:06,294
- Here's the camera.
- Oh.

996
00:45:06,705 --> 00:45:08,665
Okay, party people, get together.

997
00:45:08,832 --> 00:45:10,132
Yeah. Everybody say...

998
00:45:10,292 --> 00:45:12,132
Super Friends!

999
00:45:12,294 --> 00:45:13,674
Let me see it! Let me see!

1000
00:45:13,837 --> 00:45:15,417
Classic! We got everyone.

1001
00:45:16,048 --> 00:45:17,508
Yeah, everyone.

1002
00:45:17,674 --> 00:45:18,804
Thanks, Batman.

1003
00:45:18,967 --> 00:45:21,597
Yeah, no problem. I did, like, a burst.

1004
00:45:21,804 --> 00:45:23,764
<i>This party is the bomb!</i>

1005
00:45:23,931 --> 00:45:27,311
Look at me! More like
Martian Dance Hunter, am I right?

1006
00:45:28,977 --> 00:45:30,267
'Puter, call kid.

1007
00:45:31,021 --> 00:45:32,021
Bat-Dad?

1008
00:45:32,439 --> 00:45:33,439
How's it going?

1009
00:45:33,607 --> 00:45:35,647
'Cause everything is
going great down here.

1010
00:45:35,818 --> 00:45:36,818
I can see the target.

1011
00:45:36,985 --> 00:45:38,380
<i>But there's some kind of
laser energy thing</i>

1012
00:45:38,404 --> 00:45:39,494
<i>that I can't get through.</i>

1013
00:45:39,655 --> 00:45:41,445
Okay. I'll see if I can shut it off.

1014
00:45:41,615 --> 00:45:43,676
But I'm gonna have to make up
an excuse to leave this party

1015
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,200
without anyone noticing.

1016
00:45:46,662 --> 00:45:47,702
Bye.

1017
00:45:49,081 --> 00:45:50,308
Kid, tell me when it's off, all right?

1018
00:45:50,332 --> 00:45:51,332
- Now?
<i>- No.</i>

1019
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:52,540
- Now?
<i>- No.</i>

1020
00:45:52,709 --> 00:45:53,749
- Now?
<i>- Not quite.</i>

1021
00:45:53,919 --> 00:45:54,919
- Now?
<i>- No.</i>

1022
00:45:55,087 --> 00:45:56,167
<i>- My son...
- No.</i>

1023
00:45:56,338 --> 00:45:58,316
<i>These irreplaceable crystals
contain all my knowledge,</i>

1024
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:00,260
<i>which I now pass on to...</i>

1025
00:46:00,426 --> 00:46:02,506
Darn it. It's gotta be one of these.
Is this the one?

1026
00:46:03,387 --> 00:46:05,257
O.M. gosh! You did it, <i>Padre!</i>
It's off!

1027
00:46:05,431 --> 00:46:06,431
<i>Okay.</i>

1028
00:46:06,598 --> 00:46:08,368
Now you gotta make your way
to the Atomic Cauldron

1029
00:46:08,392 --> 00:46:10,062
and get that Phantom Zone Projector.

1030
00:46:10,227 --> 00:46:12,187
<i>- Do exactly as I say.</i>
- 10-4!

1031
00:46:12,354 --> 00:46:13,524
Okay. Jump!

1032
00:46:15,274 --> 00:46:17,114
<i>Do a front flip. Do a backflip.</i>

1033
00:46:18,444 --> 00:46:20,574
<i>Run, run, run. Drop.</i>

1034
00:46:20,737 --> 00:46:22,107
That's excellent listening.

1035
00:46:22,281 --> 00:46:23,281
<i>Shimmy.</i>

1036
00:46:23,449 --> 00:46:25,449
<i>Strafe-left. Strafe-right.</i>

1037
00:46:25,617 --> 00:46:26,657
<i>Avoid.</i>

1038
00:46:26,827 --> 00:46:28,787
Hey, I was thinking.
If I'm gonna be a superhero,

1039
00:46:28,954 --> 00:46:32,504
and go on awesome superhero missions
like this one, can we use code names?

1040
00:46:33,792 --> 00:46:34,792
Mine can be Robin.

1041
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,630
- I'm sorry, say that again?
<i>- Robin!</i>

1042
00:46:36,795 --> 00:46:39,375
As in the small, Midwestern frail bird?

1043
00:46:39,548 --> 00:46:42,268
<i>Yeah, and I already have a catch phrase.
Tweet, tweet, on the street.</i>

1044
00:46:42,301 --> 00:46:43,681
- Hard pass.
<i>- And a song.</i>

1045
00:46:43,844 --> 00:46:45,264
<i>Fly, Robin, fly</i>

1046
00:46:45,429 --> 00:46:48,019
Harder pass. Now slide!

1047
00:46:48,182 --> 00:46:49,392
<i>Okay, kid. I'm gonna teach you</i>

1048
00:46:49,558 --> 00:46:51,728
<i>how to masterbuild your way
inside that thing.</i>

1049
00:46:51,894 --> 00:46:52,904
Yay!

1050
00:46:53,061 --> 00:46:55,191
<i>Grab those 2x6's, pull out the axle studs,</i>

1051
00:46:55,397 --> 00:46:56,567
<i>disconnect the 6x10 plates.</i>

1052
00:46:56,732 --> 00:46:57,732
Like this?

1053
00:46:57,941 --> 00:46:59,781
Whoa! Unbelievable obeying.

1054
00:46:59,943 --> 00:47:01,073
<i>Now, let's ride.</i>

1055
00:47:01,236 --> 00:47:02,396
<i>Toes to the nose.</i>

1056
00:47:02,571 --> 00:47:03,821
<i>Now you're gleaming the cube.</i>

1057
00:47:03,989 --> 00:47:05,739
- Yeah!
- Now, get creative.

1058
00:47:05,908 --> 00:47:08,158
<i>Freestyle a little bit.
Oh, that's good, kid!</i>

1059
00:47:08,327 --> 00:47:10,367
It's like looking in a Bat-mirror.

1060
00:47:10,537 --> 00:47:12,367
<i>Okay. Leap.</i>

1061
00:47:15,167 --> 00:47:17,037
- I've got the Projector, Dad.
<i>- Booyah!</i>

1062
00:47:17,211 --> 00:47:20,091
Now do everything we just did backwards.

1063
00:47:20,422 --> 00:47:21,592
Oh.

1064
00:47:22,758 --> 00:47:24,678
Oh! Here you go, Dad. We did it!

1065
00:47:24,843 --> 00:47:28,063
Yeah! Mission accomplished.
That was fun!

1066
00:47:30,307 --> 00:47:33,187
You okay, Batman?
You seem the opposite of stern.

1067
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:35,769
Yeah, I'm fine. It's just

1068
00:47:35,938 --> 00:47:38,478
watching you out there,

1069
00:47:38,649 --> 00:47:42,109
it was like the world wasn't
all darkness anymore.

1070
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:45,610
<i>For a brief moment</i>

1071
00:47:45,781 --> 00:47:48,911
I could have sworn I felt something.

1072
00:47:49,076 --> 00:47:51,496
<i>That feeling is pride, sir.</i>

1073
00:47:52,162 --> 00:47:53,502
You're right.

1074
00:47:53,664 --> 00:47:55,334
I am super proud.

1075
00:47:57,167 --> 00:47:58,997
Of myself.

1076
00:47:59,169 --> 00:48:02,459
For being such
a good teacher, obviously.

1077
00:48:02,798 --> 00:48:04,968
Yeah, you're a great teacher.

1078
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:06,133
I am?

1079
00:48:06,301 --> 00:48:09,391
Yeah! I wanna be just like you
when I grow up, <i>Padre!</i>

1080
00:48:09,555 --> 00:48:11,215
Wait, what did you call me?

1081
00:48:12,307 --> 00:48:13,847
I called you <i>Padre.</i>

1082
00:48:14,685 --> 00:48:17,435
It's Spanish for "Dad." Sorry.

1083
00:48:17,604 --> 00:48:20,984
Well, isn't it also a cool Spanish way
to say "buddy"?

1084
00:48:21,149 --> 00:48:23,029
Yeah, I could've been
saying it that way.

1085
00:48:23,193 --> 00:48:24,283
Then I'll allow it.

1086
00:48:24,444 --> 00:48:25,784
Oh, you're such a great <i>padre!</i>

1087
00:48:26,321 --> 00:48:27,321
What are you doing?

1088
00:48:27,489 --> 00:48:29,489
I'm trying to give you a big old hug.

1089
00:48:29,658 --> 00:48:30,988
Thought you were attacking me.

1090
00:48:32,035 --> 00:48:34,655
<i>Hey, you up for another
top secret superhero mission</i>

1091
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:36,080
<i>to defeat the Joker?</i>

1092
00:48:36,248 --> 00:48:38,378
<i>Oh, I am down to stop that clown.</i>

1093
00:48:38,542 --> 00:48:40,842
But I don't wanna make
my other dad, Bruce Wayne, angry.

1094
00:48:41,003 --> 00:48:42,480
Do you think we'll be done
before my bedtime?

1095
00:48:42,504 --> 00:48:43,514
Bedtime?

1096
00:48:43,672 --> 00:48:45,172
Batman's life lesson number two.

1097
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:47,180
Vigilantes don't have bedtimes.

1098
00:48:47,342 --> 00:48:48,342
Yes!

1099
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:51,560
So, what's the vigilante policy
on cookies?

1100
00:48:51,847 --> 00:48:53,677
Unlimited!

1101
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:58,020
<i>All right, kid.
We need to avoid Commissioner Gordon.</i>

1102
00:48:59,187 --> 00:49:00,897
<i>So, lesson number three.</i>

1103
00:49:01,523 --> 00:49:02,863
When going stealth,

1104
00:49:03,025 --> 00:49:06,945
you gotta hide every part of you,
physically and emotionally.

1105
00:49:07,529 --> 00:49:08,569
- Got it?
- Yeah!

1106
00:49:08,739 --> 00:49:09,739
Already failed.

1107
00:49:09,906 --> 00:49:11,576
Now, what I need you to do

1108
00:49:11,783 --> 00:49:15,543
is use the naturally dark areas
of your costume,

1109
00:49:15,704 --> 00:49:19,294
and integrate into the dark parts
of this environment.

1110
00:49:19,458 --> 00:49:20,538
Okay.

1111
00:49:20,709 --> 00:49:22,589
- Can you see me?
- Yes.

1112
00:49:22,753 --> 00:49:24,593
- How about now?
- Yes.

1113
00:49:24,755 --> 00:49:26,625
- What about now? Now?
- Yes.

1114
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:28,548
Yes. You're a goner, kid.

1115
00:49:28,717 --> 00:49:30,547
- Batman?
- Barbara!

1116
00:49:33,096 --> 00:49:34,966
Batman? Batman!

1117
00:49:35,641 --> 00:49:36,891
Hey, there. Look at you.

1118
00:49:37,059 --> 00:49:38,519
- Who's this?
- Hi, police lady.

1119
00:49:38,727 --> 00:49:40,227
- Is that your son?
- Yes, I am.

1120
00:49:40,395 --> 00:49:42,305
Is that my son...
No, that's just weird.

1121
00:49:42,481 --> 00:49:43,841
It's weirder if it's not your son.

1122
00:49:43,982 --> 00:49:46,232
Right. No, I don't...

1123
00:49:46,485 --> 00:49:48,445
I'm not in a relationship or anything.

1124
00:49:48,612 --> 00:49:50,242
I could have a kid.

1125
00:49:50,739 --> 00:49:52,989
<i>I mean, if I met the right lady,</i>

1126
00:49:53,158 --> 00:49:56,158
and if she was just standing
right in front of me,

1127
00:49:56,328 --> 00:49:59,408
and we looked at each other and thought,
"Hey, let's do this."

1128
00:49:59,581 --> 00:50:01,331
"Let's be together."

1129
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,960
- Batman?
- Yes?

1130
00:50:03,126 --> 00:50:06,086
I hope you're back because you've decided
to work together

1131
00:50:06,254 --> 00:50:07,424
on the Joker case.

1132
00:50:07,673 --> 00:50:08,723
Uh...

1133
00:50:08,924 --> 00:50:11,184
Yeah. Absolutely!

1134
00:50:11,385 --> 00:50:12,385
Great.

1135
00:50:12,928 --> 00:50:15,508
Ooh. Arkham Asylum.

1136
00:50:15,681 --> 00:50:16,949
- So, before we question the Joker...
- Uh-huh.

1137
00:50:16,973 --> 00:50:18,493
...I'm gonna need you to hand
over all your weapons.

1138
00:50:18,517 --> 00:50:20,267
I mean, I don't know if I have anything...

1139
00:50:20,435 --> 00:50:21,475
Oh!

1140
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:23,110
I just got a couple here. There.

1141
00:50:23,271 --> 00:50:24,361
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

1142
00:50:24,523 --> 00:50:25,523
Oh. Of course.

1143
00:50:25,691 --> 00:50:27,627
What about the utility belt?
Anything in your cape?

1144
00:50:27,651 --> 00:50:28,941
Under your cowl?

1145
00:50:29,111 --> 00:50:30,321
And your shoes.

1146
00:50:30,487 --> 00:50:31,487
There we go.

1147
00:50:31,655 --> 00:50:33,365
Uh... This is really uncomfortable.

1148
00:50:33,532 --> 00:50:35,452
Sorry. My shoes are part of my pants.

1149
00:50:36,868 --> 00:50:37,868
Oops.

1150
00:50:38,036 --> 00:50:39,246
- Batman?
- Yes?

1151
00:50:39,413 --> 00:50:41,123
Why is your "not son"

1152
00:50:41,289 --> 00:50:43,789
trying to smuggle
the Phantom Zone Projector into Arkham?

1153
00:50:43,959 --> 00:50:46,499
What? Hey, kid. What is this?

1154
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:48,710
Batman, give me
the Phantom Zone Projector.

1155
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:49,880
- No.
- Batman!

1156
00:50:50,048 --> 00:50:51,609
Give me the Phantom Zone Projector!
Give it to me!

1157
00:50:51,633 --> 00:50:52,933
No, no, no! Whoa! Nice.

1158
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:55,470
I studied Brazilian jiu-jitsu
at Harvard for Police.

1159
00:50:55,637 --> 00:50:58,177
Oh, yeah? Well, guess who got
a PhD in smoke bombs!

1160
00:50:58,348 --> 00:50:59,388
Dr. Batman.

1161
00:50:59,558 --> 00:51:00,678
Guards! Get them!

1162
00:51:00,976 --> 00:51:01,976
Freeze, Batman!

1163
00:51:02,144 --> 00:51:05,234
Hey, kid. This is a training exercise.
These guys are my bros.

1164
00:51:05,397 --> 00:51:07,125
- Go ahead and take a couple of them out.
- Cool!

1165
00:51:07,149 --> 00:51:08,149
Hey, Frank.

1166
00:51:08,316 --> 00:51:09,356
You want a piece of Robin?

1167
00:51:09,484 --> 00:51:11,034
Barney!
Nice compound fracture!

1168
00:51:11,194 --> 00:51:12,954
How'd you like a punch, Glen?

1169
00:51:13,905 --> 00:51:14,905
Code Red!

1170
00:51:15,073 --> 00:51:16,743
I need total security lockdown, now!

1171
00:51:19,703 --> 00:51:20,913
Om!

1172
00:51:22,456 --> 00:51:23,706
'Sup, Joker?

1173
00:51:23,874 --> 00:51:25,254
Namaste, Batman.

1174
00:51:25,417 --> 00:51:26,877
- Namaste.
- Gross.

1175
00:51:27,043 --> 00:51:28,503
Ooh. Briefs man. Me, too.

1176
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:30,800
Cut the baloney.
Kid, guard the door, will ya?

1177
00:51:30,964 --> 00:51:32,094
On it! Take that, Alan!

1178
00:51:32,382 --> 00:51:35,682
Huh. Looks like you're going to
a lot of trouble for little old me.

1179
00:51:35,844 --> 00:51:38,014
I must be your greatest enemy after all.

1180
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:39,510
Right, Batman?

1181
00:51:39,848 --> 00:51:41,928
- I see what you're trying to do.
- And what is that?

1182
00:51:42,058 --> 00:51:44,978
You're trying to entrap me
into a relationship.

1183
00:51:45,145 --> 00:51:47,305
- Really?
- Yeah, and it's not gonna work.

1184
00:51:47,481 --> 00:51:48,691
Oh, yes, it is.

1185
00:51:48,857 --> 00:51:50,857
Because I'm inside your head.

1186
00:51:51,234 --> 00:51:52,594
- No, you're not!
- No, you're not!

1187
00:51:52,694 --> 00:51:53,704
I knew you'd say that.

1188
00:51:53,862 --> 00:51:55,282
- No, you didn't!
- No, you didn't!

1189
00:51:55,447 --> 00:51:57,117
And I knew you'd say that!

1190
00:51:57,282 --> 00:51:59,412
See? We aren't so different, I and you.

1191
00:51:59,576 --> 00:52:01,176
- It's, "you and I!"
- It's, "you and I!"

1192
00:52:01,495 --> 00:52:03,905
- Argh!
- Admit it. I'm your greatest enemy.

1193
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,520
You're not my greatest enemy, Joker.

1194
00:52:05,582 --> 00:52:07,882
Okay, then send me to the Phantom Zone.

1195
00:52:08,043 --> 00:52:09,043
Fine, I will.

1196
00:52:09,211 --> 00:52:11,711
And prove I'm your greatest enemy.

1197
00:52:13,131 --> 00:52:14,551
Batman, don't do this.

1198
00:52:14,716 --> 00:52:18,176
As long as you're in the Phantom Zone,
I'll be saving Gotham City,

1199
00:52:18,345 --> 00:52:20,005
and that's all that matters to me.

1200
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:21,520
Goodbye, Joker.

1201
00:52:21,681 --> 00:52:23,601
Oh, Batman, thank you!

1202
00:52:26,019 --> 00:52:29,399
Yes! That's what I call
saving the city again!

1203
00:52:29,564 --> 00:52:31,274
Batman, what are you doing?

1204
00:52:31,441 --> 00:52:32,691
I'm Batman-ing.

1205
00:52:34,069 --> 00:52:35,989
<i>I'm Batman
I'm awesome</i>

1206
00:52:36,154 --> 00:52:37,164
<i>I got a nine-pack</i>

1207
00:52:37,322 --> 00:52:38,322
<i>Stop it!</i>

1208
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:40,240
Batman, I can't believe you did this.

1209
00:52:40,408 --> 00:52:41,408
Hi, police lady.

1210
00:52:41,576 --> 00:52:42,736
And even worse,

1211
00:52:42,911 --> 00:52:45,251
you've made this kid
into an accessory to your crime.

1212
00:52:46,414 --> 00:52:47,464
Sorry, kid.

1213
00:52:47,624 --> 00:52:48,634
That's okay, ma'am.

1214
00:52:48,792 --> 00:52:50,853
As long as I'm doing a dime
in the big house with my old man,

1215
00:52:50,877 --> 00:52:52,167
everything's gonna be A-okay.

1216
00:52:52,337 --> 00:52:54,417
Officers, take this Projector
to the evidence room.

1217
00:52:54,589 --> 00:52:56,309
- You got it.
- And get this man some pants.

1218
00:52:56,424 --> 00:52:57,474
I'm good the way I am.

1219
00:52:57,634 --> 00:53:00,354
B Go, why has nobody fist bumped me yet?

1220
00:53:00,804 --> 00:53:04,774
You know, when I was a kid,

1221
00:53:05,433 --> 00:53:07,893
I wanted to be you, Batman.

1222
00:53:08,436 --> 00:53:10,436
I wanted to be as strong

1223
00:53:10,605 --> 00:53:13,275
and as fast and as smart as Batman.

1224
00:53:14,276 --> 00:53:16,276
But you're not who I thought you were.

1225
00:53:16,778 --> 00:53:18,068
Uh... What do you mean?

1226
00:53:19,114 --> 00:53:22,454
You can't be a hero
if you only care about yourself.

1227
00:53:23,285 --> 00:53:25,285
Barbara, I...

1228
00:53:27,497 --> 00:53:28,747
I think you're underestimating

1229
00:53:28,915 --> 00:53:31,455
the importance of the Joker
being in the Phantom Zone.

1230
00:53:32,127 --> 00:53:34,457
Really, it's kind of a stroke
of genius. All the...

1231
00:53:34,629 --> 00:53:35,629
Hey, where are you going?

1232
00:53:35,797 --> 00:53:39,297
I just put Joker in the one place
he can't do anyone any harm.

1233
00:53:40,635 --> 00:53:41,635
Yeah.

1234
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:46,680
But what if you just gave Joker
exactly what he wanted?

1235
00:54:11,791 --> 00:54:12,831
Oh!

1236
00:54:15,837 --> 00:54:16,837
Whoa!

1237
00:54:17,005 --> 00:54:19,415
Look at this place!
Am I being too loud?

1238
00:54:20,842 --> 00:54:22,432
<i>- Hi!</i>
- Oh, my gosh!

1239
00:54:22,677 --> 00:54:24,347
<i>Sorry. I always do that.</i>

1240
00:54:24,512 --> 00:54:25,656
How about a warning next time?

1241
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,080
<i>You're so right, and I am so wrong.</i>

1242
00:54:27,182 --> 00:54:29,022
<i>Welcome to the Phantom Zone, bad guy.</i>

1243
00:54:29,184 --> 00:54:30,194
Yeah, bad guy.

1244
00:54:30,352 --> 00:54:32,371
<i>- My name is Phyllis.</i>
- Oh, that was my grandma's name.

1245
00:54:32,395 --> 00:54:34,975
<i>Now hold still while I scan you.</i>

1246
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:36,860
<i>Scanning for badness.</i>

1247
00:54:37,025 --> 00:54:38,565
<i>Trying to assess whether you are bad.</i>

1248
00:54:43,531 --> 00:54:45,241
<i>Ugh! Your whole thing screams "bad guy."</i>

1249
00:54:45,575 --> 00:54:47,695
Oh, yeah. I'm a really bad person.

1250
00:54:47,869 --> 00:54:49,619
<i>But with vulnerabilities.</i>

1251
00:54:49,788 --> 00:54:51,828
Who, me? No way.

1252
00:54:51,998 --> 00:54:54,788
So, where do you keep
all the other bad people in this place?

1253
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:56,750
<i>They're standing right behind you.</i>

1254
00:54:56,962 --> 00:54:58,252
Whoa!

1255
00:54:59,255 --> 00:55:00,295
Hi there, guys.

1256
00:55:00,465 --> 00:55:01,825
Lovely to meet you all. I'm the...

1257
00:55:01,967 --> 00:55:03,797
Oh, fist bump?
There we... Handshake?

1258
00:55:04,511 --> 00:55:06,051
It doesn't matter.
I'm the Joker.

1259
00:55:06,221 --> 00:55:07,601
Take a look at the new guy.

1260
00:55:07,764 --> 00:55:10,064
Guess they'll just let anybody in here.

1261
00:55:10,225 --> 00:55:11,595
Oh, no, no, no. I'm very bad, too.

1262
00:55:11,768 --> 00:55:13,978
They just showed a video montage...

1263
00:55:14,145 --> 00:55:15,555
- Boring!
- What?

1264
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:17,320
- You're boring.
- He looks delicious.

1265
00:55:17,524 --> 00:55:18,734
Let's eat this guy.

1266
00:55:20,318 --> 00:55:22,608
Stop with the violence for just a second!

1267
00:55:22,779 --> 00:55:26,069
What if I told you
I could get you outta here?

1268
00:55:27,575 --> 00:55:28,719
I'm sorry, what'd you just say?

1269
00:55:28,743 --> 00:55:30,253
That's right. I'm so bad,

1270
00:55:30,453 --> 00:55:33,583
I got myself thrown into
this heck-hole on purpose!

1271
00:55:33,748 --> 00:55:34,788
I'm listening.

1272
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:37,038
Count me interested.

1273
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:38,920
Look, everyone here knows

1274
00:55:39,087 --> 00:55:41,417
what it's like to be hurt
by a hero, don't they?

1275
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:43,549
We've all been taken for granted, right?

1276
00:55:43,717 --> 00:55:45,387
- Yeah, bro.
- I'm relating.

1277
00:55:45,552 --> 00:55:49,262
Well, that's why I came
to this space prison.

1278
00:55:49,431 --> 00:55:50,911
To recruit the universe's greatest...

1279
00:55:51,057 --> 00:55:53,137
- We'll do it!
- I'm sorry?

1280
00:55:53,309 --> 00:55:54,745
You were going to
say something about

1281
00:55:54,769 --> 00:55:56,729
recruiting the universe's
greatest villains

1282
00:55:56,896 --> 00:55:59,266
to conquer a superhero.

1283
00:55:59,441 --> 00:56:01,031
- Am I right?
- Uh, yeah.

1284
00:56:01,192 --> 00:56:03,032
- Well, we're in!
- Yay!

1285
00:56:03,278 --> 00:56:04,630
Really? Because I brought a PowerPoint...

1286
00:56:04,654 --> 00:56:05,744
Still boring!

1287
00:56:05,905 --> 00:56:07,155
Yeah. Just get on with it.

1288
00:56:07,323 --> 00:56:08,783
You want us to humiliate him?

1289
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:09,990
I certainly do. Yes.

1290
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,700
You want us to make him
grovel at your feet?

1291
00:56:12,871 --> 00:56:14,751
I would like to see that very much!

1292
00:56:14,914 --> 00:56:17,084
You want us to smite him?

1293
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:18,460
Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1294
00:56:18,626 --> 00:56:20,386
You want us to make
the rivers of Gotham City

1295
00:56:20,503 --> 00:56:22,133
run red with his blood?

1296
00:56:22,297 --> 00:56:23,417
Oh, that's...

1297
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:25,970
Oh, no blood?
How do you feel about lava?

1298
00:56:26,134 --> 00:56:27,144
Yes! Lava.

1299
00:56:27,302 --> 00:56:28,302
- Done.
- Yay!

1300
00:56:28,511 --> 00:56:29,751
I can't wait
to crush buildings.

1301
00:56:29,804 --> 00:56:30,814
Excuse me. Hello?

1302
00:56:30,972 --> 00:56:32,642
Over here.
I don't want to be a downer,

1303
00:56:32,807 --> 00:56:34,887
but how exactly are we going
to get outta this place?

1304
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:37,980
Oh, leave that to me.

1305
00:56:38,563 --> 00:56:39,813
Don't wanna jinx us,

1306
00:56:39,981 --> 00:56:42,321
but I'll be a lot happier when
this Phantom Zone Projector

1307
00:56:42,525 --> 00:56:43,985
is locked up tight.

1308
00:56:45,487 --> 00:56:46,697
Going up, ma'am?

1309
00:56:46,863 --> 00:56:49,993
No. You're going down!

1310
00:56:50,658 --> 00:56:52,408
Look out! Smash!

1311
00:56:53,495 --> 00:56:55,655
I guess you're right.
I am going up. Ding!

1312
00:56:58,166 --> 00:57:00,166
Here comes the...

1313
00:57:00,335 --> 00:57:02,835
Phantom Zone!

1314
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:06,880
Huh?

1315
00:57:08,676 --> 00:57:10,006
I'm gonna go start looting.

1316
00:57:10,178 --> 00:57:13,468
Hello, Gotham City!

1317
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:16,140
The Clown Prince of Crime

1318
00:57:16,434 --> 00:57:17,944
<i>is back!</i>

1319
00:57:18,103 --> 00:57:20,523
Commissioner Gordon,
you gotta take a look at this.

1320
00:57:20,772 --> 00:57:21,772
<i>What's that?</i>

1321
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:23,820
A monkey
and dog are friends.

1322
00:57:23,983 --> 00:57:25,323
Not that. That!

1323
00:57:25,485 --> 00:57:28,525
<i>And I've come
to finally take over the city.</i>

1324
00:57:28,696 --> 00:57:30,656
<i>But in order to do that,</i>

1325
00:57:30,824 --> 00:57:34,704
<i>I need to break my friends
out of a giant, scary prison.</i>

1326
00:57:34,869 --> 00:57:37,159
- Hey, guys, he means us!
- Yay!

1327
00:57:37,372 --> 00:57:38,542
<i>And I ain't talking about</i>

1328
00:57:38,706 --> 00:57:41,376
<i>those rogue losers dressed in cosplay!</i>

1329
00:57:41,668 --> 00:57:43,418
- Oh!
- Me-ouch.

1330
00:57:43,586 --> 00:57:45,796
I'm talking about my new peeps!

1331
00:57:45,964 --> 00:57:47,424
And they're just like me.

1332
00:57:47,715 --> 00:57:50,255
The greatest villains you'll ever see.

1333
00:57:50,426 --> 00:57:51,966
You wanna meet them?

1334
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:53,890
- No.
- Too bad.

1335
00:57:55,181 --> 00:57:56,601
<i>He's evil, he's magic,</i>

1336
00:57:56,766 --> 00:57:59,556
<i>and it's about to get tragic.</i>

1337
00:57:59,727 --> 00:58:01,397
<i>It's Voldemort.</i>

1338
00:58:01,563 --> 00:58:02,813
Magic!

1339
00:58:04,399 --> 00:58:05,779
You are a fish.

1340
00:58:05,942 --> 00:58:06,942
You are a frog.

1341
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:08,110
You are a fish frog.

1342
00:58:08,278 --> 00:58:10,858
<i>He's a 9,000-year-old
incarnation of evil,</i>

1343
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:12,660
<i>with an eye forjewelry.</i>

1344
00:58:12,824 --> 00:58:14,414
<i>Give it up for Sauron!</i>

1345
00:58:14,576 --> 00:58:16,576
Good afternoon, Gotham City.

1346
00:58:21,207 --> 00:58:24,087
<i>He likes long, violent walks
on historic buildings.</i>

1347
00:58:24,252 --> 00:58:25,672
<i>It's King Kong!</i>

1348
00:58:25,837 --> 00:58:27,047
Come at me, Gotham!

1349
00:58:29,007 --> 00:58:32,217
Commissioner Gordon, these monsters,
they're too powerful.

1350
00:58:32,927 --> 00:58:34,297
Can you contain them to downtown?

1351
00:58:34,929 --> 00:58:36,219
That's gonna be impossible.

1352
00:58:36,389 --> 00:58:38,099
Half the police force are fish!

1353
00:58:38,266 --> 00:58:40,766
Sergeant Jackson!
Stop floppin' around!

1354
00:58:40,935 --> 00:58:42,935
<i>And rounding out
the evil all-stars,</i>

1355
00:58:43,104 --> 00:58:44,314
<i>Wicked Witch!</i>

1356
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:45,770
<i>Medusa.</i>

1357
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:47,280
<i>And British robots!</i>

1358
00:58:47,442 --> 00:58:48,572
Exterminate!

1359
00:58:48,735 --> 00:58:50,065
<i>Ask your nerd friends.</i>

1360
00:58:50,612 --> 00:58:52,992
<i>Hello? Bad guys?</i>

1361
00:58:56,951 --> 00:59:00,081
What a crew, huh?
And they all work for me!

1362
00:59:00,246 --> 00:59:03,956
Who's the greatest villain
of them all now, Batman?

1363
00:59:04,125 --> 00:59:05,285
Still not you.

1364
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:07,500
Actually, this does look
pretty terrifying, Bat-Dad.

1365
00:59:07,629 --> 00:59:08,629
Whee!

1366
00:59:08,796 --> 00:59:10,296
Nice destruction all around.

1367
00:59:10,465 --> 00:59:11,465
<i>Watch your step!</i>

1368
00:59:11,633 --> 00:59:13,133
<i>Good work, guys!</i>

1369
00:59:13,301 --> 00:59:15,261
Now, all that's left for me

1370
00:59:15,428 --> 00:59:18,308
is to rub it in Batman's bat face.

1371
00:59:18,473 --> 00:59:20,933
Hey, Sauron, doesn't your flaming eye

1372
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:23,770
have a unique ability
to peer through time and space?

1373
00:59:23,978 --> 00:59:26,148
- Uh-huh.
- Well, I need to find Batman.

1374
00:59:26,314 --> 00:59:27,864
Where's homeboy's man cave?

1375
00:59:28,066 --> 00:59:29,816
Hmm. Give me a second.

1376
00:59:29,984 --> 00:59:31,114
Scary noise.

1377
00:59:31,277 --> 00:59:32,897
It's beneath Wayne Manor!

1378
00:59:33,112 --> 00:59:34,256
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1379
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:35,280
Hold on a sec.

1380
00:59:35,448 --> 00:59:37,118
Are you trying to tell me

1381
00:59:37,283 --> 00:59:39,953
that Bruce Wayne is Batman...

1382
00:59:40,787 --> 00:59:41,997
...'s roommate?

1383
00:59:42,497 --> 00:59:44,247
Uh... Yeah.

1384
00:59:44,958 --> 00:59:47,878
Evil army, this way to the Batcave!

1385
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:53,340
Good grief!

1386
01:00:06,062 --> 01:00:07,402
Hey, Batman!

1387
01:00:07,563 --> 01:00:09,403
Joker's home.

1388
01:00:10,692 --> 01:00:13,572
I'm rubbing my butt
all over your stuff.

1389
01:00:13,736 --> 01:00:15,856
We're going to have to rename this
the Butt-mobile.

1390
01:00:17,949 --> 01:00:19,079
Hey, evil army.

1391
01:00:19,242 --> 01:00:20,662
I need Batman brought here.

1392
01:00:20,827 --> 01:00:22,157
Now go get him!

1393
01:00:22,328 --> 01:00:23,498
Joker out!

1394
01:00:26,833 --> 01:00:27,833
Uh...

1395
01:00:28,001 --> 01:00:29,091
<i>Padre?</i>

1396
01:00:29,252 --> 01:00:30,252
<i>Yeah?</i>

1397
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:31,840
Do you ever get scared?

1398
01:00:32,547 --> 01:00:33,587
No.

1399
01:00:34,507 --> 01:00:37,717
Yeah, that's what I figured,
'cause you're Batman.

1400
01:00:44,142 --> 01:00:47,562
Hey, kid.
You know who does get scared?

1401
01:00:47,729 --> 01:00:48,729
<i>Who?</i>

1402
01:00:48,938 --> 01:00:50,268
Bruce Wayne.

1403
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,230
<i>- Really?</i>
- Yeah.

1404
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,070
Bruno told me once

1405
01:00:54,235 --> 01:00:57,445
that sometimes the only way
to get out of a down moment

1406
01:00:57,613 --> 01:00:59,243
is to start boxing.

1407
01:00:59,741 --> 01:01:01,701
And by "boxing," he meant

1408
01:01:01,868 --> 01:01:03,238
beatboxing.

1409
01:01:03,411 --> 01:01:04,621
Oh!

1410
01:01:04,787 --> 01:01:06,867
<i>Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na...</i>

1411
01:01:09,208 --> 01:01:10,918
<i>Feel it, uh-huh</i>

1412
01:01:11,085 --> 01:01:12,955
<i>Dick Grayson on the mic, go</i>

1413
01:01:13,129 --> 01:01:14,129
Oh. Um...

1414
01:01:19,927 --> 01:01:22,057
Oh, my gosh.
This does make me feel better.

1415
01:01:22,221 --> 01:01:23,261
Okay. Shh. Batman solo.

1416
01:01:23,431 --> 01:01:25,601
<i>Bat, bat, bat
Can I get a bat?</i>

1417
01:01:25,767 --> 01:01:27,097
<i>Can I get a bat?
Bat...</i>

1418
01:01:27,268 --> 01:01:28,268
The Bat-Fax!

1419
01:01:30,355 --> 01:01:32,185
Ha! The city needs me.
Bang, bang, bang!

1420
01:01:32,357 --> 01:01:33,397
Excuse me.

1421
01:01:33,566 --> 01:01:35,896
Can you get the commissioner
and show her this?

1422
01:01:36,069 --> 01:01:38,279
- Batman.
- Would you stop doing that?

1423
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:40,660
I sent the Bat-Fax.

1424
01:01:41,157 --> 01:01:43,327
I hate to say this,
but you're right.

1425
01:01:43,493 --> 01:01:44,493
The city needs you.

1426
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:45,790
Yes! Let me out.

1427
01:01:45,953 --> 01:01:48,793
I'm only going to let you out
on one condition.

1428
01:01:48,956 --> 01:01:51,666
- Name it.
- You can't do it by yourself.

1429
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:55,800
Fine. Who am I working with?

1430
01:01:55,963 --> 01:01:58,423
SEAL Team Six? Fox Force Five?
Suicide Squad?

1431
01:01:58,591 --> 01:02:00,681
No. Me.

1432
01:02:00,843 --> 01:02:01,843
Oh, I wanna help, too!

1433
01:02:02,011 --> 01:02:03,371
- And I shall join as well.
- Whoa!

1434
01:02:03,513 --> 01:02:05,313
Alfred Pennyworth
at your service, ma'am.

1435
01:02:05,473 --> 01:02:07,201
- How did you...
- Alfred, you gotta let me out of here.

1436
01:02:07,225 --> 01:02:10,305
Sir, those creatures out there
are unlike anything we've ever seen.

1437
01:02:10,478 --> 01:02:12,498
Speak for yourself.
You don't know everything I've seen.

1438
01:02:12,522 --> 01:02:13,722
I haven't told you everything.

1439
01:02:13,815 --> 01:02:16,315
And you'll never be able
to defeat them alone.

1440
01:02:16,484 --> 01:02:18,654
And it'll be more fun
if we all do it together!

1441
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:20,490
What's the worst thing
that could happen?

1442
01:02:20,905 --> 01:02:22,485
What are you so afraid of?

1443
01:02:22,657 --> 01:02:24,487
The thing I'm most afraid of?

1444
01:02:29,831 --> 01:02:31,791
I gotta be honest with you.
It's snake clowns.

1445
01:02:31,958 --> 01:02:33,168
Yeah, that's not a thing.

1446
01:02:33,334 --> 01:02:34,754
Well then, nothing.

1447
01:02:34,961 --> 01:02:37,171
- I'm not afraid of anything.
- Okay.

1448
01:02:37,922 --> 01:02:39,172
Prove it.

1449
01:02:39,507 --> 01:02:41,007
- Oh, I will.
- Good.

1450
01:02:41,175 --> 01:02:43,465
Do you know what the B-A-T
in Batman stands for?

1451
01:02:43,636 --> 01:02:45,806
- Not really.
- Best At Teamwork.

1452
01:02:45,972 --> 01:02:48,352
Best At Teamwork Man
is my full name.

1453
01:02:48,516 --> 01:02:50,346
Yay! We're going on a family trip.

1454
01:02:50,518 --> 01:02:52,058
This is not a family trip.

1455
01:02:52,228 --> 01:02:53,398
I can wear my costume, too.

1456
01:02:53,563 --> 01:02:55,833
Well, luckily for us,
you left your costume back at the...

1457
01:02:55,857 --> 01:02:57,067
- Rip!
- Oh!

1458
01:02:57,233 --> 01:02:59,403
Nope. Under your clothes.
That's perfect.

1459
01:02:59,569 --> 01:03:01,989
- Rip!
- Alfred, what are you doing?

1460
01:03:02,155 --> 01:03:03,155
I miss the '60s.

1461
01:03:03,322 --> 01:03:04,532
Hey, can Scarecrow help?

1462
01:03:04,699 --> 01:03:06,259
- Yeah!
- He's destroying our city, too!

1463
01:03:06,367 --> 01:03:08,577
Permit us to lend you assistance.

1464
01:03:08,744 --> 01:03:10,254
Yeah. Why don't we use these guys?

1465
01:03:10,413 --> 01:03:11,413
What am I gonna do?

1466
01:03:11,581 --> 01:03:13,517
Get a bunch of criminals together
to fight the criminals?

1467
01:03:13,541 --> 01:03:14,961
That's a stupid idea.

1468
01:03:18,754 --> 01:03:20,554
Okay, guys. Game plan.

1469
01:03:20,715 --> 01:03:21,795
Joker's taken the Projector

1470
01:03:21,883 --> 01:03:23,026
- to Wayne Manor.
- Wayne Manor.

1471
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:24,390
Right. Thanks, Batman.

1472
01:03:24,552 --> 01:03:25,696
- We need that Projector.
- Projector.

1473
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:26,720
Or there's no way

1474
01:03:26,888 --> 01:03:28,031
- to blast these monsters...
- Monsters.

1475
01:03:28,055 --> 01:03:29,533
- ...back to the Phantom Zone.
- Phantom Zone? Yep.

1476
01:03:29,557 --> 01:03:31,201
Batman, I really don't
need you to finish my...

1477
01:03:31,225 --> 01:03:32,265
- Sand castles.
- No.

1478
01:03:32,435 --> 01:03:33,555
- Sister's homework.
- No.

1479
01:03:33,728 --> 01:03:35,398
- Succulent something.
- No.

1480
01:03:35,897 --> 01:03:36,937
Um... Everybody?

1481
01:03:37,106 --> 01:03:39,896
Batman is in Arkham Asylum.

1482
01:03:40,067 --> 01:03:41,737
Get him!

1483
01:03:41,903 --> 01:03:43,103
Okay, everyone, grab on to me.

1484
01:03:43,905 --> 01:03:45,275
Whoa!

1485
01:03:49,494 --> 01:03:50,754
We've gotta take cover!

1486
01:03:50,953 --> 01:03:51,953
Whoa!

1487
01:03:52,330 --> 01:03:54,750
- Joker has eyes on us.
- Where?

1488
01:03:54,916 --> 01:03:58,376
No! I mean,
he literally has a giant eye on us.

1489
01:03:58,544 --> 01:04:00,254
<i>I think that thing
can see our every move!</i>

1490
01:04:00,421 --> 01:04:01,591
Shaka-laka-Iako.

1491
01:04:01,797 --> 01:04:05,217
We've got to destroy it,
or we'll never make it to Wayne Manor.

1492
01:04:05,384 --> 01:04:06,434
Uh... Bat-Dad?

1493
01:04:06,636 --> 01:04:08,036
I really think you should see this.

1494
01:04:08,179 --> 01:04:09,639
Building survey!

1495
01:04:10,431 --> 01:04:12,101
This building's not up to code!

1496
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:20,780
Gotcha.

1497
01:04:24,070 --> 01:04:25,240
Is that real lava?

1498
01:04:26,948 --> 01:04:27,948
I'm okay.

1499
01:04:30,076 --> 01:04:31,446
All right, yeah. It's 100% lava.

1500
01:04:33,454 --> 01:04:35,641
- Everyone, start throwing me bricks.
- Right away, sir.

1501
01:04:35,665 --> 01:04:37,309
<i>- I need a 4x6. Come on, quick.</i>
- Here you go.

1502
01:04:37,333 --> 01:04:38,383
<i>- I need an elbow.</i>
- Elbow.

1503
01:04:45,299 --> 01:04:46,299
Ow!

1504
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:52,430
<i>Whoo!</i>

1505
01:04:52,598 --> 01:04:54,848
<i>Yes! I did it. Pretty cool, huh?</i>

1506
01:04:55,017 --> 01:04:56,517
<i>- Batman?
- Yeah?</i>

1507
01:04:56,686 --> 01:04:59,106
Why did you build this thing
with only one seat?

1508
01:04:59,272 --> 01:05:02,282
'Cause last I checked,
I only had one butt. What the...

1509
01:05:03,109 --> 01:05:04,939
<i>What have you done to Wayne Manor?</i>

1510
01:05:05,778 --> 01:05:07,528
<i>Hey, Batman, guess what!</i>

1511
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:09,370
I found out one of your secrets.

1512
01:05:09,657 --> 01:05:12,157
- Uh-oh.
- What do we have here, Batman?

1513
01:05:12,326 --> 01:05:14,406
It looks like a bunch
of relationship comedies.

1514
01:05:14,579 --> 01:05:16,289
- What's that one?
<i>- Must Love Dogs.</i>

1515
01:05:16,455 --> 01:05:17,495
Must love crying.

1516
01:05:17,665 --> 01:05:19,625
<i>- Marley & Me.</i>
- I love the ending.

1517
01:05:19,792 --> 01:05:22,462
Oh! <i>Serendipity?</i>

1518
01:05:22,628 --> 01:05:24,298
We have <i>Serendipity?</i>
I love that movie!

1519
01:05:24,463 --> 01:05:26,223
<i>For a loner, Batman,</i>

1520
01:05:26,382 --> 01:05:29,682
<i>you sure like movies
about relationships!</i>

1521
01:05:29,844 --> 01:05:31,084
Oh! And look what else I found!

1522
01:05:31,512 --> 01:05:33,512
<i>All your wonderful toys.</i>

1523
01:05:35,975 --> 01:05:39,725
<i>Accio</i> lightning storm!

1524
01:05:40,688 --> 01:05:43,478
Uh... Everyone, hold on.

1525
01:05:48,613 --> 01:05:51,663
<i>Gremlins,
dismantle that plane now!</i>

1526
01:05:52,867 --> 01:05:54,287
Ugly monsters on our three.

1527
01:05:55,995 --> 01:05:57,705
- Uh<i>... Padre?</i>
- Not now, kid.

1528
01:05:59,582 --> 01:06:01,132
<i>Kind of got my hands full.</i>

1529
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,960
I've got good tone. Firing.

1530
01:06:08,924 --> 01:06:10,724
- Uh... Batman?
- What's up, buddy?

1531
01:06:11,177 --> 01:06:12,507
<i>Are we nearly at Wayne Manor?</i>

1532
01:06:12,678 --> 01:06:13,848
<i>Why?</i>

1533
01:06:14,263 --> 01:06:16,143
Uh... Your number two
needs to go number one.

1534
01:06:16,307 --> 01:06:18,477
I thought I told you
to go back at the prison.

1535
01:06:18,643 --> 01:06:20,393
- I tried, but Bane was in there.
- So?

1536
01:06:20,561 --> 01:06:22,861
He had sort of a "get out
of this bathroom now" vibe.

1537
01:06:23,022 --> 01:06:25,522
<i>I knew I shouldn't
have given you that water.</i>

1538
01:06:27,276 --> 01:06:28,986
Can you hold it in like a big boy?

1539
01:06:29,445 --> 01:06:30,655
Engine one down.

1540
01:06:30,821 --> 01:06:32,382
Not a big deal.
Don't worry about it. It's fine.

1541
01:06:32,406 --> 01:06:34,326
- Engine two down.
- It does that sometimes.

1542
01:06:34,909 --> 01:06:36,039
<i>We've lost engine three.</i>

1543
01:06:36,202 --> 01:06:37,452
Oh. Could live without it.

1544
01:06:39,246 --> 01:06:40,706
<i>Engine four!</i>

1545
01:06:42,458 --> 01:06:43,748
That I do need to fix.

1546
01:06:43,918 --> 01:06:45,998
Good news.
Our bathroom problem is solved.

1547
01:06:48,589 --> 01:06:50,389
<i>You three wait here
while I go fix the engine.</i>

1548
01:06:50,424 --> 01:06:53,184
Don't worry, Batman.
You fix the Batwing, I'll fly.

1549
01:06:53,344 --> 01:06:54,988
All good, Babs.
I've got my autopilot on it.

1550
01:06:55,012 --> 01:06:56,012
Done.

1551
01:06:56,347 --> 01:06:58,137
<i>Autopilot?
That's just a rope!</i>

1552
01:06:58,307 --> 01:07:01,597
Exactly. All right, guys.
Until I get back, rope's in charge.

1553
01:07:02,353 --> 01:07:03,403
Thanks, rope.

1554
01:07:05,981 --> 01:07:08,781
All right, let's see.
Yes, the piston brake out here.

1555
01:07:08,943 --> 01:07:11,453
Jet engine brake in here and...

1556
01:07:12,613 --> 01:07:14,703
Get out of here. No.
Give me... No! Stop it!

1557
01:07:14,865 --> 01:07:16,505
Come on, Master Dick.
We need to help him.

1558
01:07:16,575 --> 01:07:17,615
I'm with you, Grandpa!

1559
01:07:17,785 --> 01:07:18,905
Get off my <i>Padre!</i>

1560
01:07:19,078 --> 01:07:20,958
Unhand him,
you animatronic fiends.

1561
01:07:21,122 --> 01:07:24,252
What are you two doing here?
I told you to stay in the cockpit.

1562
01:07:25,126 --> 01:07:27,036
You disobeyed me.
You're on a timeout.

1563
01:07:27,211 --> 01:07:28,841
Batman, you're on a timeout.

1564
01:07:29,004 --> 01:07:31,264
What? Alfred, you better
un-timeout me right now!

1565
01:07:31,424 --> 01:07:33,684
No. Not until you un-timeout Master Dick.

1566
01:07:35,094 --> 01:07:36,764
Guys, you're all un-timeouted!

1567
01:07:36,929 --> 01:07:37,929
We have incoming!

1568
01:07:38,097 --> 01:07:40,097
- Sir! Watch out for those...
- What are you doing?

1569
01:07:46,188 --> 01:07:47,728
Okay. Everybody, timeout off.

1570
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:49,480
Whoo-hoo! I've been parented.

1571
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:51,780
- Batman, I can help you.
- No. Protect the rope.

1572
01:07:51,944 --> 01:07:53,364
The rope is fine!

1573
01:07:53,529 --> 01:07:54,609
Save Master Dick!

1574
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:57,410
I'm fine. I'll just do
one of my gymnastics moves to...

1575
01:07:59,034 --> 01:08:00,124
No!

1576
01:08:05,833 --> 01:08:06,883
Dick...

1577
01:08:10,588 --> 01:08:11,758
Gotcha!

1578
01:08:15,426 --> 01:08:17,336
Hold on, Alfred. I'm almost there!

1579
01:08:18,929 --> 01:08:20,179
No!

1580
01:08:22,767 --> 01:08:24,637
Alfred!

1581
01:08:33,527 --> 01:08:34,697
No.

1582
01:08:39,366 --> 01:08:40,866
No!

1583
01:08:42,077 --> 01:08:43,197
Move over, rope.

1584
01:08:45,372 --> 01:08:46,542
<i>Hold on!</i>

1585
01:09:00,221 --> 01:09:01,721
Gotcha!

1586
01:09:02,681 --> 01:09:03,811
Barbara, did you see that?

1587
01:09:03,974 --> 01:09:05,394
Batrope saved Alfred.

1588
01:09:05,559 --> 01:09:08,229
Sick moves, rope.
I never doubted you, bro.

1589
01:09:08,395 --> 01:09:10,395
<i>Actually, sir,
Ms. Gordon saved him.</i>

1590
01:09:10,564 --> 01:09:11,824
Rope! You lied to me!

1591
01:09:12,817 --> 01:09:15,357
Wait a minute.
You mean, without you,

1592
01:09:15,528 --> 01:09:16,738
Alfred would have been

1593
01:09:17,571 --> 01:09:18,911
<i>street meat?</i>

1594
01:09:19,073 --> 01:09:21,583
Batman, trust us.

1595
01:09:21,742 --> 01:09:23,582
We can do this.

1596
01:09:23,744 --> 01:09:26,664
- Yeah. I know Gymkata.
- Sorry, what's that?

1597
01:09:26,831 --> 01:09:28,461
It's a gymnastics-based martial art.

1598
01:09:28,749 --> 01:09:30,919
I can punch those '80s monsters
off the plane.

1599
01:09:31,085 --> 01:09:32,335
Uh... Okay.

1600
01:09:32,837 --> 01:09:34,797
<i>Multiple bogeys on our six.</i>

1601
01:09:34,964 --> 01:09:36,244
Sir, I'll get them off our back.

1602
01:09:36,382 --> 01:09:38,102
I was a tail gunner
for the Royal Air Force.

1603
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:39,425
Locked and loaded, sir!

1604
01:09:39,593 --> 01:09:40,643
Good. Love that!

1605
01:09:40,803 --> 01:09:42,603
I got an idea.
We're gonna change course.

1606
01:09:42,763 --> 01:09:44,933
<i>I want you to fly straight
into that flaming eyeball.</i>

1607
01:09:45,099 --> 01:09:47,849
- What?
- Barbara, trust me.

1608
01:09:48,602 --> 01:09:50,732
All right. Let's do this.

1609
01:09:58,070 --> 01:09:59,700
We got a giant
sea monster, 12 o'clock!

1610
01:09:59,864 --> 01:10:00,874
Got it.

1611
01:10:02,408 --> 01:10:04,368
- We've got his attention.
- He's tracking us.

1612
01:10:09,415 --> 01:10:10,995
I've got you now.

1613
01:10:15,629 --> 01:10:17,339
Eat dirt!

1614
01:10:17,506 --> 01:10:19,586
Bob's your uncle, you ruddy duff cobblers!

1615
01:10:26,056 --> 01:10:27,306
Okay, Babs, this is it.

1616
01:10:27,474 --> 01:10:29,694
Fly us straight into that eye,
and wait for my signal.

1617
01:10:29,852 --> 01:10:30,982
Can it come now?

1618
01:10:31,145 --> 01:10:32,645
Can we make the signal thing happen?

1619
01:10:32,813 --> 01:10:33,813
Almost there.

1620
01:10:33,981 --> 01:10:35,861
<i>Almost there!</i>

1621
01:10:36,025 --> 01:10:38,145
- Fire!
<i>- Almost there!</i>

1622
01:10:38,319 --> 01:10:39,449
That fire's coming in hot!

1623
01:10:39,612 --> 01:10:40,652
Hot, hot, hot!

1624
01:10:41,113 --> 01:10:42,323
Now! Barbara, dive bomb!

1625
01:10:45,659 --> 01:10:47,449
My eye!

1626
01:10:49,663 --> 01:10:51,503
Sauron!

1627
01:10:57,129 --> 01:10:58,589
Nothing to see.

1628
01:11:05,262 --> 01:11:06,312
Whoo-hoo!

1629
01:11:06,513 --> 01:11:08,723
- Yes! That was so rad!
- We did it, everyone!

1630
01:11:08,891 --> 01:11:10,021
That was so great! Go team!

1631
01:11:10,184 --> 01:11:11,384
Come on, let's hear it for us!

1632
01:11:11,477 --> 01:11:12,687
That was incredible!

1633
01:11:12,853 --> 01:11:13,853
I felt so jazzed!

1634
01:11:14,021 --> 01:11:15,191
I say "jazzed"!

1635
01:11:15,356 --> 01:11:17,436
I gotta give it to you, Batman.
That was awesome.

1636
01:11:17,608 --> 01:11:19,048
- Ha! And you were awesome.
- Thanks.

1637
01:11:19,193 --> 01:11:20,503
<i>- And you were awesome.</i>
- I love compliments!

1638
01:11:20,527 --> 01:11:22,237
And you were awesome,
and I was amazing.

1639
01:11:22,404 --> 01:11:24,341
I'm not trying to make it
about myself, obviously.

1640
01:11:24,365 --> 01:11:26,885
But I just wanna make sure
that everyone gets a pat on the back.

1641
01:11:27,034 --> 01:11:28,595
- Because it feels good.
- It does feel good.

1642
01:11:28,619 --> 01:11:30,180
<i>You had a good idea, you had a good idea,</i>

1643
01:11:30,204 --> 01:11:32,214
and you had a good idea,
and I had a great idea.

1644
01:11:32,373 --> 01:11:34,654
You know what, I think that collectively,
I'm gonna add...

1645
01:11:36,210 --> 01:11:37,540
...one.

1646
01:11:37,753 --> 01:11:38,923
- No way!
- Yes!

1647
01:11:39,088 --> 01:11:40,168
Man, that feels good.

1648
01:11:40,339 --> 01:11:41,839
Best team ever!

1649
01:11:42,007 --> 01:11:44,288
Let's take a photo!
All right, everyone, squeeze together.

1650
01:11:44,385 --> 01:11:45,425
Hang on a second.

1651
01:11:45,594 --> 01:11:47,474
- Nice and close!
- I gotta get my pump on.

1652
01:11:47,638 --> 01:11:48,823
- It's worth it.
- Okay, everybody in?

1653
01:11:48,847 --> 01:11:49,887
These abs are no fluke.

1654
01:11:50,057 --> 01:11:51,637
Everyone say, "Bat Family!"

1655
01:11:51,809 --> 01:11:52,889
Bat Family!

1656
01:11:53,727 --> 01:11:55,147
Ooh, let's take a look!

1657
01:11:56,188 --> 01:11:57,358
<i>Look at that!</i>

1658
01:11:57,523 --> 01:11:58,903
- Splendid.
- Wow.

1659
01:11:59,650 --> 01:12:01,240
Didn't it turn out great?

1660
01:12:02,069 --> 01:12:04,279
Hey, guys! It's my first family photo!

1661
01:12:34,268 --> 01:12:35,598
- Hey, Bat-Dad.
- Oh!

1662
01:12:35,978 --> 01:12:37,598
Whoa. What are you doing?

1663
01:12:37,771 --> 01:12:40,021
I'm trying to give you a big, old H-U-G.

1664
01:12:40,190 --> 01:12:41,570
Okay, just...

1665
01:12:43,068 --> 01:12:44,988
Batman, are you okay?

1666
01:12:45,404 --> 01:12:47,364
Yeah, I'm fine.

1667
01:12:47,531 --> 01:12:49,661
We are just one big happy

1668
01:12:49,825 --> 01:12:53,365
fraternity of people
who did an awesome job together.

1669
01:12:54,788 --> 01:12:56,498
I can't think of any other way
to put that.

1670
01:12:56,665 --> 01:12:58,915
- Cool.
- So, guys, listen up!

1671
01:12:59,084 --> 01:13:00,714
Taking the Projector from the Joker

1672
01:13:00,878 --> 01:13:03,048
is gonna be our most
dangerous mission yet.

1673
01:13:03,213 --> 01:13:04,673
- A family battle mission!
- Right.

1674
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:07,430
Salvage what you can out of the Scuttler,
and maybe root around,

1675
01:13:07,593 --> 01:13:09,279
see if you can find
a few Vitamin waters or something,

1676
01:13:09,303 --> 01:13:10,303
and then we'll head out.

1677
01:13:10,471 --> 01:13:12,311
- Right away, sir.
- Anything for you, <i>Padre.</i>

1678
01:13:17,394 --> 01:13:19,194
I think I'll need snowshoes.

1679
01:13:19,354 --> 01:13:22,864
Yeah, I don't think you'll need snowshoes,
but could you grab that flashlight?

1680
01:13:23,025 --> 01:13:24,105
- Batman?
<i>- Padre?</i>

1681
01:13:24,276 --> 01:13:25,316
Sir?

1682
01:13:25,486 --> 01:13:27,946
What are you doing?
Hey, Batman.

1683
01:13:28,113 --> 01:13:29,413
Please, wait!

1684
01:13:29,573 --> 01:13:30,783
'Puter.

1685
01:13:32,576 --> 01:13:33,736
<i>Yes, sir?</i>

1686
01:13:33,911 --> 01:13:35,621
I'm locking in some coordinates now.

1687
01:13:37,164 --> 01:13:38,874
Take the Scuttler to the taco stand

1688
01:13:39,041 --> 01:13:40,921
on the border of Gotham City
and Blüdhaven.

1689
01:13:41,085 --> 01:13:42,335
No!

1690
01:13:42,503 --> 01:13:44,564
I want you to get these guys
a couple of chimichangas

1691
01:13:44,588 --> 01:13:46,758
- and three Jarritos.
- Sir!

1692
01:13:46,924 --> 01:13:50,144
And then keep them there until this
whole attack on Gotham City blows over.

1693
01:13:50,302 --> 01:13:53,012
<i>Padre,</i> please. Don't do this!

1694
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:55,180
Batman, you need us!

1695
01:13:55,516 --> 01:13:57,426
How many times I gotta tell you?

1696
01:13:58,060 --> 01:14:00,270
Batman works alone.

1697
01:14:00,896 --> 01:14:02,516
No, we have to stick together.

1698
01:14:03,899 --> 01:14:05,029
Please.

1699
01:14:05,192 --> 01:14:06,822
Now go on, Scuttler. Go!

1700
01:14:07,861 --> 01:14:09,661
- Go! Just get outta here.
- Batman.

1701
01:14:09,822 --> 01:14:10,912
<i>- Padre!</i>
- Get moving!

1702
01:14:11,073 --> 01:14:12,243
Please!

1703
01:14:12,449 --> 01:14:13,449
Just go.

1704
01:14:13,617 --> 01:14:14,827
Batman! Please, wait!

1705
01:14:14,993 --> 01:14:16,453
Scuttler, move out!

1706
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:18,120
<i>You're doing the wrong thing!</i>

1707
01:14:18,288 --> 01:14:20,578
<i>- Listen to me! Don't do this!
- Sir, please. Sir!</i>

1708
01:14:20,749 --> 01:14:22,079
<i>No!</i>

1709
01:14:43,939 --> 01:14:46,069
Scanning for intruders.
Scanning for intruders.

1710
01:14:46,233 --> 01:14:47,783
Scanning for intruders.

1711
01:14:51,155 --> 01:14:52,155
Hi, Bats.

1712
01:14:52,322 --> 01:14:53,822
What have you done to my...

1713
01:14:53,991 --> 01:14:55,581
Bruce Wayne's house?

1714
01:14:55,742 --> 01:14:58,502
You'd better hope he's a cool guy
and doesn't go crazy.

1715
01:14:58,662 --> 01:15:00,332
What happened to all your friends?

1716
01:15:00,497 --> 01:15:03,707
I don't need friends.
I don't need anyone to stop you.

1717
01:15:05,752 --> 01:15:07,212
Are you sure about that?

1718
01:15:07,379 --> 01:15:09,379
Look in the mirror, Batman.

1719
01:15:10,883 --> 01:15:13,763
When I saw you working
with your friend-family,

1720
01:15:14,553 --> 01:15:16,223
I actually thought you'd changed.

1721
01:15:16,972 --> 01:15:18,022
But, no.

1722
01:15:18,182 --> 01:15:19,602
You pushed them away.

1723
01:15:23,061 --> 01:15:25,771
You've run away from every other person
in your life.

1724
01:15:25,939 --> 01:15:28,439
But I'm the one you're always chasing.

1725
01:15:28,609 --> 01:15:30,819
Is this about that stupid
"greatest enemy" thing?

1726
01:15:30,986 --> 01:15:32,446
No, it's not.

1727
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:34,950
Not anymore.

1728
01:15:35,115 --> 01:15:36,275
You tell him, Joker!

1729
01:15:36,450 --> 01:15:37,700
It's time for a fresh start.

1730
01:15:37,868 --> 01:15:38,988
<i>He's not worth it.</i>

1731
01:15:39,161 --> 01:15:42,581
I think after 78 years,
I deserve respect!

1732
01:15:42,748 --> 01:15:44,538
That is right. Respect!

1733
01:15:45,125 --> 01:15:49,295
Do you realize that you have never once

1734
01:15:49,463 --> 01:15:51,133
said the words,

1735
01:15:51,298 --> 01:15:52,668
"I hate you, Joker"?

1736
01:15:52,841 --> 01:15:53,931
Not once.

1737
01:15:54,092 --> 01:15:57,222
Well, I am starting to feel
pretty annoyed with you right now.

1738
01:15:57,387 --> 01:15:58,427
That's for darn sure.

1739
01:15:58,597 --> 01:16:00,927
Annoyed is not the same thing!

1740
01:16:01,642 --> 01:16:03,562
Listen, Batman.

1741
01:16:04,102 --> 01:16:05,812
I...

1742
01:16:05,979 --> 01:16:07,229
hate you.

1743
01:16:07,397 --> 01:16:09,107
- Aww!
- That's nice.

1744
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:10,980
Now you say it.

1745
01:16:13,153 --> 01:16:14,153
Me, too.

1746
01:16:18,033 --> 01:16:20,493
You won't. You won't change.

1747
01:16:20,661 --> 01:16:23,331
'Cause you can't.
You won't, and you can't.

1748
01:16:23,497 --> 01:16:25,077
Batman will never change.

1749
01:16:25,249 --> 01:16:27,289
You know what, boo-boo?
Just shut it down.

1750
01:16:27,459 --> 01:16:29,499
These diseased lunatics are right.

1751
01:16:29,670 --> 01:16:30,670
Yes, we are!

1752
01:16:30,837 --> 01:16:33,087
I am not gonna be part

1753
01:16:33,257 --> 01:16:35,757
of a one-sided relationship any longer!

1754
01:16:35,926 --> 01:16:37,320
<i>- Yes!</i>
- What are you talking about?

1755
01:16:37,344 --> 01:16:39,184
- You and I are done!
- What is wrong with you?

1756
01:16:39,346 --> 01:16:40,346
I'm moving on!

1757
01:16:40,514 --> 01:16:41,684
That's ridiculous.

1758
01:16:41,848 --> 01:16:43,518
And on my way out,

1759
01:16:43,684 --> 01:16:46,774
I'm gonna blow up Gotham City!

1760
01:16:46,937 --> 01:16:48,727
No. You're not serious.

1761
01:16:48,897 --> 01:16:49,977
<i>Wingardium Leviosa!</i>

1762
01:16:50,649 --> 01:16:51,779
No!

1763
01:16:51,942 --> 01:16:53,992
You know what?
For once, Batman, you're right.

1764
01:16:54,152 --> 01:16:56,362
I'm not your greatest enemy.

1765
01:16:56,530 --> 01:16:58,320
Your greatest enemy

1766
01:16:58,490 --> 01:16:59,740
is you.

1767
01:16:59,908 --> 01:17:02,288
<i>- Goodbye, Batman.</i>
- Wait a minute. Hold on a second.

1768
01:17:02,452 --> 01:17:03,872
<i>Good for you, boo-boo!</i>

1769
01:17:04,037 --> 01:17:06,367
- Yay!
- Everybody, get a bomb. Let's go.

1770
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:08,790
- Bomb, bomb, bomb. Let's bomb it out.
- Yay!

1771
01:17:13,046 --> 01:17:15,166
<i>Say goodbye, Gotham City!</i>

1772
01:17:26,351 --> 01:17:27,941
- Whoa.
<i>- Hi!</i>

1773
01:17:28,186 --> 01:17:29,186
<i>Whoa!</i>

1774
01:17:29,563 --> 01:17:31,063
Oh, I am so sorry.

1775
01:17:31,231 --> 01:17:32,709
<i>It was all my fault, I keep doing that.</i>

1776
01:17:32,733 --> 01:17:34,943
<i>Welcome to the Phantom Zone, bad guy.</i>

1777
01:17:35,110 --> 01:17:36,360
What are you talking about?

1778
01:17:36,528 --> 01:17:37,528
I'm not a bad guy.

1779
01:17:37,696 --> 01:17:39,406
<i>But you're all in black.
You have a cape.</i>

1780
01:17:39,573 --> 01:17:40,823
<i>And you wear a big, scary mask.</i>

1781
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:41,991
Well, I'm not.

1782
01:17:42,159 --> 01:17:43,449
<i>And you kicked me in the face.</i>

1783
01:17:43,618 --> 01:17:45,498
Listen, I'm Batman.

1784
01:17:45,871 --> 01:17:47,581
<i>Oof! You even sound like a bad guy.</i>

1785
01:17:47,748 --> 01:17:49,208
I swear, I am a good guy.

1786
01:17:49,374 --> 01:17:51,134
<i>Okay, Mr. Batman.</i>

1787
01:17:51,293 --> 01:17:52,963
<i>Hold still while I scan you.</i>

1788
01:17:53,253 --> 01:17:54,923
<i>Scanning for badness.</i>

1789
01:17:55,088 --> 01:17:56,088
<i>Yes, sir?</i>

1790
01:17:56,256 --> 01:17:58,086
<i>- You're super nimble, right?
- I sure am!</i>

1791
01:17:58,258 --> 01:18:00,258
<i>And 110% expendable?</i>

1792
01:18:00,427 --> 01:18:02,217
<i>I don't know what that means, but okay.</i>

1793
01:18:02,387 --> 01:18:03,531
<i>- How'd I do, Dad?
- Mediocre.</i>

1794
01:18:03,555 --> 01:18:05,305
<i>- Yes!
- And don't call me Dad.</i>

1795
01:18:05,766 --> 01:18:06,766
<i>Sorry.</i>

1796
01:18:08,727 --> 01:18:11,267
<i>Alfred, put that kid
on the next jet to the orphanage.</i>

1797
01:18:11,938 --> 01:18:16,188
<i>But doesn't he deserve a chance
for someone to take him under their wing,</i>

1798
01:18:16,568 --> 01:18:19,398
<i>as I took you under mine?</i>

1799
01:18:19,738 --> 01:18:21,618
<i>Listen, you don't have a family.</i>

1800
01:18:21,948 --> 01:18:24,448
<i>So what do you know about
having a surrogate son?</i>

1801
01:18:28,038 --> 01:18:29,038
<i>Batman!</i>

1802
01:18:29,873 --> 01:18:31,963
<i>We have to stick together.</i>

1803
01:18:32,667 --> 01:18:33,747
<i>Please.</i>

1804
01:18:36,046 --> 01:18:39,256
<i>Joker, you mean nothing to me.</i>

1805
01:18:41,843 --> 01:18:43,103
<i>No one does.</i>

1806
01:18:47,057 --> 01:18:49,937
<i>Huh. You're not a traditional bad guy.</i>

1807
01:18:50,769 --> 01:18:53,229
<i>But you're not exactly a good guy, either.</i>

1808
01:18:53,438 --> 01:18:54,558
<i>- Batman?</i>
- Padre?

1809
01:18:55,023 --> 01:18:56,653
<i>You even abandoned your friends.</i>

1810
01:18:56,817 --> 01:18:57,857
What?

1811
01:18:58,026 --> 01:18:59,436
<i>Go on, Scuttler. Go.</i>

1812
01:18:59,611 --> 01:19:01,111
<i>- Batman, no. No!
- Don't do this!</i>

1813
01:19:01,279 --> 01:19:02,659
Abandoned? No.

1814
01:19:02,823 --> 01:19:04,413
No, I was trying to protect them.

1815
01:19:04,574 --> 01:19:06,374
<i>By pushing them away?</i>

1816
01:19:06,535 --> 01:19:07,735
Well, yeah.

1817
01:19:08,912 --> 01:19:11,422
<i>Are they really
the ones you're protecting?</i>

1818
01:19:14,626 --> 01:19:16,496
<i>Computer, Batman's in danger.</i>

1819
01:19:16,670 --> 01:19:18,550
<i>Please, Computer, take us back!</i>

1820
01:19:18,713 --> 01:19:20,913
<i>Do you really want the man
who made you to come to harm?</i>

1821
01:19:21,007 --> 01:19:23,137
<i>Batman programmed me
to obey him.</i>

1822
01:19:23,301 --> 01:19:25,181
<i>But he didn't say to not not rescue him.</i>

1823
01:19:25,345 --> 01:19:26,595
What are they doing?

1824
01:19:26,763 --> 01:19:28,063
Come on, guys. Let's hustle.

1825
01:19:28,223 --> 01:19:30,433
Gotham City's not gonna blow itself up.

1826
01:19:31,435 --> 01:19:33,015
<i>Well, hello!</i>

1827
01:19:38,567 --> 01:19:40,737
'Puter, go to super-secret stealth mode.

1828
01:19:43,989 --> 01:19:45,739
- Hold on!
- No!

1829
01:19:45,907 --> 01:19:49,367
Evil buddies, those are my last three
painful reminders of Batman.

1830
01:19:49,536 --> 01:19:50,906
Run!

1831
01:19:51,079 --> 01:19:52,369
Come on, Alfred. This way.

1832
01:19:52,539 --> 01:19:53,789
Wait, where's Dick?

1833
01:19:53,957 --> 01:19:55,237
<i>The little guy? He's over there.</i>

1834
01:19:55,292 --> 01:19:56,727
<i>Initializing Batcave
operating system.</i>

1835
01:19:56,751 --> 01:19:58,041
What's he doing?

1836
01:19:58,211 --> 01:19:59,711
<i>I've gotta save my family!</i>

1837
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:00,880
Just think.

1838
01:20:01,047 --> 01:20:03,047
- What would Batman do?
- What?

1839
01:20:03,216 --> 01:20:06,136
I know. Not listen to anyone else.
Be mean to people.

1840
01:20:06,386 --> 01:20:08,046
Destroy as much property as possible.

1841
01:20:08,221 --> 01:20:10,221
Talk in a really low, gravelly voice.

1842
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:11,890
And go it alone.

1843
01:20:12,058 --> 01:20:13,188
Kid, don't do that.

1844
01:20:13,393 --> 01:20:14,773
<i>Atomic batteries to power.</i>

1845
01:20:14,936 --> 01:20:15,936
<i>Turbines to speed.</i>

1846
01:20:16,104 --> 01:20:17,114
Don't do what I would do!

1847
01:20:17,272 --> 01:20:18,752
<i>I never even taught you how to drive!</i>

1848
01:20:18,899 --> 01:20:20,649
Hold on a second, Brick Lady.

1849
01:20:20,817 --> 01:20:23,107
I'm so sorry.
I need to get down there and stop this.

1850
01:20:23,278 --> 01:20:25,818
<i>I can't let you go.
My boss will be really mad at me.</i>

1851
01:20:25,989 --> 01:20:27,549
Yeah. But I bet
your boss would be happy

1852
01:20:27,657 --> 01:20:29,857
if you were able to get
all those bad guys back in here.

1853
01:20:29,951 --> 01:20:31,241
<i>Hmm. She sure would.</i>

1854
01:20:31,411 --> 01:20:33,751
Then let me try.
Let me get down there and help them.

1855
01:20:33,914 --> 01:20:35,874
<i>But haven't you tried that before?</i>

1856
01:20:37,501 --> 01:20:38,921
<i>This way, Alfred.</i>

1857
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:43,050
<i>You do the same thing over and over.</i>

1858
01:20:47,093 --> 01:20:48,553
<i>What's gonna change?</i>

1859
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:49,760
<i>No!</i>

1860
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:53,480
I know what I need to do.

1861
01:20:53,642 --> 01:20:55,942
Just give me 24 hours,
and I'll come back.

1862
01:20:56,811 --> 01:20:58,271
Whoa!

1863
01:20:58,438 --> 01:21:00,318
You've gotta let me go
down there and save them.

1864
01:21:02,859 --> 01:21:03,899
I'll do whatever you want.

1865
01:21:05,195 --> 01:21:07,315
- Please.
<i>- Exterminate!</i>

1866
01:21:07,489 --> 01:21:08,489
Please.

1867
01:21:08,657 --> 01:21:10,697
<i>Okay, but I need all the bad guys
locked up in here.</i>

1868
01:21:10,742 --> 01:21:11,952
I promise.

1869
01:21:14,454 --> 01:21:16,624
<i>And I mean all of them.</i>

1870
01:21:18,124 --> 01:21:19,844
One of these buttons
has to save my friends.

1871
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:21,620
<i>Self-destruct mode activated.</i>

1872
01:21:21,670 --> 01:21:22,670
Self what?

1873
01:21:24,047 --> 01:21:25,757
- Master Dick!
- No!

1874
01:21:28,134 --> 01:21:29,764
Dick!

1875
01:21:29,928 --> 01:21:31,718
Look who's bat!

1876
01:21:33,348 --> 01:21:34,808
What?

1877
01:21:43,149 --> 01:21:45,649
Everyone okay? Dick, Alfred, Barbara.

1878
01:21:45,819 --> 01:21:47,819
<i>- Are you guys...</i>
- We're fine, Batman.

1879
01:21:50,574 --> 01:21:53,834
Listen, I just wanted to say

1880
01:21:56,663 --> 01:21:58,333
that I'm really,

1881
01:21:59,416 --> 01:22:01,666
really, really,

1882
01:22:03,295 --> 01:22:04,835
really, really, really,

1883
01:22:05,005 --> 01:22:06,335
really, really...

1884
01:22:07,507 --> 01:22:09,047
s-s-s...

1885
01:22:12,345 --> 01:22:15,265
Soooo...

1886
01:22:16,725 --> 01:22:17,725
Sorry?

1887
01:22:17,892 --> 01:22:19,942
Yeah. Whoo! I did it!

1888
01:22:23,064 --> 01:22:25,324
I don't even know why
you bothered coming back.

1889
01:22:28,194 --> 01:22:29,824
<i>I was</i>

1890
01:22:30,697 --> 01:22:31,697
<i>afraid.</i>

1891
01:22:32,657 --> 01:22:33,827
What?

1892
01:22:35,702 --> 01:22:37,542
The reason I came back

1893
01:22:38,204 --> 01:22:40,044
was the same reason I left you.

1894
01:22:43,043 --> 01:22:44,713
I was afraid

1895
01:22:46,171 --> 01:22:47,761
of feeling

1896
01:22:49,007 --> 01:22:51,377
the pain you feel

1897
01:22:52,886 --> 01:22:54,546
when you lose

1898
01:22:55,722 --> 01:22:58,142
someone close to you.

1899
01:23:06,024 --> 01:23:08,074
Gotham needs us.

1900
01:23:08,610 --> 01:23:11,740
So I came back to do this.

1901
01:23:12,322 --> 01:23:13,322
Flip.

1902
01:23:14,949 --> 01:23:16,789
Flip? What is that? I don't...

1903
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:18,500
You gotta turn around.

1904
01:23:20,497 --> 01:23:23,037
<i>I call it the Babs-Signal.</i>

1905
01:23:23,208 --> 01:23:25,708
<i>And I'm flipping the switch for you.</i>

1906
01:23:25,877 --> 01:23:29,917
Because saving this city
is too big a job for one person.

1907
01:23:30,090 --> 01:23:31,590
Flip, flip.

1908
01:23:36,429 --> 01:23:38,769
<i>So, what do you say, Commish?</i>

1909
01:23:38,932 --> 01:23:41,562
Will you work with me?

1910
01:23:42,102 --> 01:23:43,852
I need your help.

1911
01:23:45,271 --> 01:23:47,111
I thought you'd never ask.

1912
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:51,238
I'm very, very proud of you, sir.

1913
01:23:51,403 --> 01:23:55,573
But there's still only four of us
against Joker's entire army.

1914
01:23:55,740 --> 01:23:57,740
That's why I called in some backup.

1915
01:23:57,909 --> 01:23:59,909
Flip! Flip! Flip! Flip!

1916
01:24:01,246 --> 01:24:03,326
- Whoa!
- We saw your signal,

1917
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:04,540
and we came to help.

1918
01:24:04,958 --> 01:24:07,588
Joker may be done with us,
but we're not done with him.

1919
01:24:07,752 --> 01:24:09,962
We will be the Joker's reckoning.

1920
01:24:10,130 --> 01:24:12,090
Joker said mean stuff to us.

1921
01:24:12,465 --> 01:24:14,085
You were right, Barbara.

1922
01:24:14,259 --> 01:24:16,969
It takes a village. Not a Batman.

1923
01:24:19,556 --> 01:24:21,466
Okay. Everybody, listen up.

1924
01:24:21,641 --> 01:24:25,311
<i>These monsters want to destroy
Gotham City.</i>

1925
01:24:25,478 --> 01:24:27,648
<i>That's right.
We need sick new vehicles.</i>

1926
01:24:27,814 --> 01:24:29,774
<i>An arsenal of advanced weaponry.</i>

1927
01:24:29,941 --> 01:24:32,491
Costumes that suit
our individual personalities.

1928
01:24:32,652 --> 01:24:33,652
Rip!

1929
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:35,910
And code names
to use on our walkie-talkies.

1930
01:24:36,072 --> 01:24:37,072
Call it out!

1931
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:38,530
Your name is Lady Bat.

1932
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:39,780
- Lady Bat?
<i>- Bat Lady.</i>

1933
01:24:39,951 --> 01:24:42,831
- Veto! Nope. What?
<i>- El Batarina. Soccer Mom... Bat?</i>

1934
01:24:43,037 --> 01:24:44,657
How about a cool costume?

1935
01:24:44,831 --> 01:24:45,831
Nice!

1936
01:24:45,999 --> 01:24:47,379
That one's called Batgirl.

1937
01:24:47,542 --> 01:24:49,632
If you call me Batgirl,
can I call you Batboy?

1938
01:24:49,794 --> 01:24:52,304
And lastly, a coordinated attack strategy,

1939
01:24:52,464 --> 01:24:54,014
and a kick-butt theme song!

1940
01:24:54,174 --> 01:24:55,184
Robin?

1941
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:57,470
My superhero code name.

1942
01:24:57,635 --> 01:24:58,885
Oh, yeah. Hit it!

1943
01:24:59,053 --> 01:25:00,053
Got it!

1944
01:25:02,182 --> 01:25:04,432
No!

1945
01:25:07,771 --> 01:25:08,811
Absolutely not.

1946
01:25:11,816 --> 01:25:14,936
This music is filling me with rage.

1947
01:25:15,111 --> 01:25:16,491
Let's use it!

1948
01:25:17,947 --> 01:25:20,217
All right, team. I'm going to need to
know your special powers.

1949
01:25:20,241 --> 01:25:21,241
I'm a giant clay person!

1950
01:25:21,409 --> 01:25:23,169
- I'm irritating.
- I have a sack for a face.

1951
01:25:23,244 --> 01:25:24,472
I make unpredictable decisions.

1952
01:25:24,496 --> 01:25:25,496
I raise the stakes!

1953
01:25:25,663 --> 01:25:26,963
I can squirt ketchup!

1954
01:25:27,123 --> 01:25:28,543
Nice! Orca.

1955
01:25:28,708 --> 01:25:30,288
I'm a whale!

1956
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:31,920
Oh, we got this covered!

1957
01:25:32,086 --> 01:25:33,126
<i>Go team!</i>

1958
01:25:35,965 --> 01:25:36,965
Whale, yeah!

1959
01:25:40,178 --> 01:25:41,928
Shh. Quiet.

1960
01:25:42,096 --> 01:25:44,136
Who's laying down those funky beats?

1961
01:25:44,307 --> 01:25:46,387
<i>- We are!

1963
01:25:48,061 --> 01:25:49,811
Evil army, get rid of them!

1964
01:25:50,688 --> 01:25:52,188
Team Gotham Family,

Here we go!

1968
01:25:59,364 --> 01:26:00,704

Smash! Smash! Smash!

1971
01:26:08,331 --> 01:26:11,131
- Whoa.
- Batman, take out Joker's bomb.

1972
01:26:11,292 --> 01:26:12,922
I'll get that Projector!

1973
01:26:13,086 --> 01:26:14,246
<i>10-4, Co-Go.</i>

1974

Freeze, Clayface, take this guy out!

1975
01:26:17,924 --> 01:26:19,804
Coming through!

1976
01:26:24,264 --> 01:26:25,814
Okay, Alfred, bring the pain.

1977
01:26:27,767 --> 01:26:30,767
Bringing it, sir. For Queen and country!

1978
01:26:32,647 --> 01:26:34,107
You just got Union Jacked!

1979
01:26:36,776 --> 01:26:37,856
Robin, get ready.

1980
01:26:38,027 --> 01:26:39,947
I'm about to teach you
some father-and-son stuff.

1981
01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:42,120
First, driving.

1982
01:26:42,282 --> 01:26:44,122
- Put your hands at 10 and 2.
- Okay.

1983
01:26:44,284 --> 01:26:46,874
Now, fly! Turn left!

1984
01:26:47,704 --> 01:26:49,084
Run over these skeletons.

1985
01:26:49,247 --> 01:26:50,617
Now drive up the wall!

1986
01:26:52,083 --> 01:26:53,963
- Great driving.
- Thanks, <i>Padre.</i>

1987
01:26:55,461 --> 01:26:56,461
Yeah!

1988
01:26:57,630 --> 01:26:58,670
Okay, Robin.

1989
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:00,970
Together, we're gonna
punch these guys so hard,

1990
01:27:01,134 --> 01:27:02,644
words describing the impact

1991
01:27:02,802 --> 01:27:05,642
are gonna spontaneously materialize
out of thin air.

1992
01:27:05,805 --> 01:27:06,885
Yeah!

1993
01:27:12,186 --> 01:27:13,516
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1994
01:27:17,275 --> 01:27:18,275
High five!

1995
01:27:18,568 --> 01:27:20,698
Stop moving around, you Muggles.

1996
01:27:20,904 --> 01:27:23,034
All right, team, let's shut him down.

1997
01:27:23,740 --> 01:27:25,780
Orca! You're up, baby!

1998
01:27:26,367 --> 01:27:28,197
You wanna see a magic trick?

1999
01:27:28,369 --> 01:27:30,159
I'm gonna make you disappear.

01:29:52,638 --> 01:29:54,678
I'm gonna have to die to know it.

2057
01:29:54,849 --> 01:29:57,889
Shut up, Joker! If there's no Gotham,

2058
01:29:58,061 --> 01:30:00,191
then I'll never get to fight you again.

2059
01:30:01,314 --> 01:30:02,614
What?

2060
01:30:03,483 --> 01:30:05,903
You're the reason why I get up
at 4:00 in the afternoon

2061
01:30:06,069 --> 01:30:08,609
and pump iron
until my chest is positively sick.

2062
01:30:09,197 --> 01:30:10,487
<i>You're the reason I've given up</i>

2063
01:30:10,656 --> 01:30:13,826
<i>a life spent with Russian ballerinas
and lady activewear models.</i>

2064
01:30:14,452 --> 01:30:15,832
And if it wasn't for you,

2065
01:30:15,995 --> 01:30:19,245
I never would have learned how connected
I am with all these people.

2066
01:30:20,249 --> 01:30:21,249
And you.

2067
01:30:23,044 --> 01:30:25,554
<i>So if you help me save Gotham,</i>

2068
01:30:27,799 --> 01:30:29,589
you'll help me save us.

2069
01:30:30,593 --> 01:30:32,893
You just said "us."

2070
01:30:33,054 --> 01:30:37,144
Yeah. Batman and the Joker.

2071
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:40,646
<i>What do you say?</i>

2072
01:30:41,479 --> 01:30:43,479
You had me at shut up.

2073
01:30:45,358 --> 01:30:46,648
How are your abs, bro?

2074
01:30:46,818 --> 01:30:50,028
Too much flab, not enough ab.
Why?

2075
01:30:50,196 --> 01:30:51,946
Because I need you to crunch them.

2076
01:30:52,323 --> 01:30:53,743
<i>Citizens of Gotham,</i>

2077
01:30:53,908 --> 01:30:58,698
<i>we need all of you to join us
and help bring this city back together.</i>

2078
01:31:24,897 --> 01:31:27,067
I'm just gonna come right out and say it.

2079
01:31:27,233 --> 01:31:29,533
I hate you, Joker.

2080
01:31:29,777 --> 01:31:31,647
- I hate you, too.
- I hate you more.

2081
01:31:31,821 --> 01:31:33,571
I hate you the most.

2082
01:31:33,739 --> 01:31:35,529
I hate you forever.

2083
01:31:36,075 --> 01:31:37,115
Splendid!

2084
01:31:38,786 --> 01:31:39,946
We did it, everyone!

2085
01:31:44,750 --> 01:31:47,000
Bane is feeling warm and fuzzy.

2086
01:31:52,049 --> 01:31:53,089
Padre,

2087
01:31:53,926 --> 01:31:55,006
where are you going?

2088
01:31:56,137 --> 01:31:57,757
I made a promise.

2089
01:31:57,930 --> 01:31:59,850
I gotta go back to the Phantom Zone.

2090
01:32:00,892 --> 01:32:01,982
<i>Sorry, kid.</i>

2091
01:32:02,143 --> 01:32:04,103
<i>Padre,</i> please.

2092
01:32:04,270 --> 01:32:06,270
Don't call me <i>Padre.</i>

2093
01:32:06,772 --> 01:32:08,192
Okay.

2094
01:32:08,774 --> 01:32:09,864
Call me...

2095
01:32:13,905 --> 01:32:15,065
Dads.

2096
01:32:15,323 --> 01:32:18,993
My two dads are the same dad.

2097
01:32:20,077 --> 01:32:22,787
But they're both leaving.

2098
01:32:23,956 --> 01:32:25,576
It's gonna be okay, kid.

2099
01:32:27,168 --> 01:32:29,668
Sometimes, losing people is part of life.

2100
01:32:30,504 --> 01:32:33,474
But that doesn't mean
you stop letting them in.

2101
01:32:34,175 --> 01:32:37,135
<i>Some very wise people taught me that.</i>

2102
01:32:37,970 --> 01:32:39,470
<i>My father figure.</i>

2103
01:32:41,015 --> 01:32:43,515
<i>My platonic coworker buddy,</i>

2104
01:32:43,684 --> 01:32:46,314
<i>who's a girl, but just a friend.</i>

2105
01:32:47,939 --> 01:32:49,149
<i>And you.</i>

2106
01:32:49,941 --> 01:32:51,281
Mi hijo.

2107
01:32:51,984 --> 01:32:53,324
<i>It's Spanish</i>

2108
01:32:54,111 --> 01:32:55,491
<i>for "son."</i>

2109
01:32:57,615 --> 01:32:59,365
This is my family,

2110
01:33:00,618 --> 01:33:02,498
but it's your family, too.

2111
01:34:06,892 --> 01:34:08,142
Do you have a knife?

2112
01:34:08,311 --> 01:34:09,311
Why?

2113
01:34:09,478 --> 01:34:13,018
'Cause someone needs to cut the tension
between the two of us immediately.

2114
01:34:14,358 --> 01:34:15,858
Okay. I deserved that.

2115
01:34:16,027 --> 01:34:17,397
<i>- Hi.</i>
- Wait a minute.

2116
01:34:17,570 --> 01:34:18,610
What's going on?

2117
01:34:18,779 --> 01:34:21,119
I came back, just like I said I would.

2118
01:34:21,282 --> 01:34:22,912
<i>You know, Mr. Batman,</i>

2119
01:34:23,075 --> 01:34:25,575
<i>when you're a talking brick,
working at the Phantom Zone,</i>

2120
01:34:25,745 --> 01:34:28,245
<i>you see a lot of crazy things.</i>

2121
01:34:28,414 --> 01:34:30,584
<i>But I've finally seen a man,</i>

2122
01:34:30,750 --> 01:34:32,590
<i>in order to make the world
a better place,</i>

2123
01:34:32,752 --> 01:34:35,252
<i>take a look at himself
and make a change.</i>

2124
01:34:36,255 --> 01:34:37,255
Who?

2125
01:34:37,631 --> 01:34:39,551
<i>- Superman.</i>
- What?

2126
01:34:39,717 --> 01:34:40,967
<i>I'm kidding. It's you.</i>

2127
01:34:44,430 --> 01:34:46,770
Well, I guess I'll be seeing you
on the streets, Batman.

2128
01:34:46,932 --> 01:34:48,932
I guess so. Catch you later, Joker.

2129
01:34:49,101 --> 01:34:50,231
Let's go, gang.

2130
01:34:50,394 --> 01:34:51,444
Wait a minute,

2131
01:34:51,812 --> 01:34:53,942
we're not just gonna
let these criminals go, right?

2132
01:34:54,106 --> 01:34:55,606
Ah, come on, Commish. Let's face it.

2133
01:34:55,775 --> 01:34:57,735
Those guys are no match
for the four of us.

2134
01:34:57,902 --> 01:34:59,572
We'll give them a 30-minute head start.

2135
01:34:59,737 --> 01:35:02,277
Besides, you can't fight crime
on an empty stomach.

2136
01:35:05,284 --> 01:35:06,454
Hey, Computer?

2137
01:35:06,619 --> 01:35:07,829
We're home!

2138
01:35:11,457 --> 01:35:12,627
<i>What is the password?</i>

2139
01:35:12,792 --> 01:35:14,462
Iron Man sucks!

2140
01:35:26,597 --> 01:35:29,477
When Dad and me were fighting,
I was giving them my best one-liners.

2141
01:35:30,309 --> 01:35:31,309
<i>You</i>

2142
01:35:33,437 --> 01:35:34,767
<i>complete me.</i>

2143
01:35:48,327 --> 01:35:51,367
Holy family photo, Batman. I love it!

2144
01:35:58,337 --> 01:35:59,507
<i>White.</i>

2145
01:35:59,672 --> 01:36:03,842
<i>All important movies end
with a white screen.</i>

2146
01:36:04,343 --> 01:36:06,473
<i>And tying up loose ends.</i>

2147
01:36:06,637 --> 01:36:08,677
We're coming for you, Gotham City!

2148
01:36:08,848 --> 01:36:10,348
<i>Like this snake clowns bit.</i>

2149
01:36:10,516 --> 01:36:12,476
<i>- Snake clowns?
- Told you they were real.</i>

2150
01:36:12,643 --> 01:36:14,853
<i>Did you stick wigs onto snakes?</i>

2151
01:36:15,020 --> 01:36:16,690
<i>- Maybe.
- That is so weird.</i>

2152
01:36:16,981 --> 01:36:18,750
<i>Can I play that song
I wrote for the end credits?</i>

2153
01:36:18,774 --> 01:36:20,054
<i>- That is a hard pass.
- Come on.</i>

2154
01:36:20,109 --> 01:36:21,109
<i>No!</i>

2155
01:36:21,318 --> 01:36:22,796
<i>Let the kid play
whatever music he wants.</i>

2156
01:36:22,820 --> 01:36:23,820
<i>- No, no, no!
- Please?</i>

2157
01:36:24,029 --> 01:36:25,029
<i>- No.</i>
- Padre?

2158
01:36:25,364 --> 01:36:26,874
<i>Fine. 'Puter.</i>

2159
01:36:27,450 --> 01:36:28,450
<i>Okay, sir.</i>

2160
01:36:28,617 --> 01:36:29,947
<i>Yay!</i>

2161
01:36:30,202 --> 01:36:32,502
<i>Now playing
Robin's happy, poppy music.</i>

2162
01:36:32,663 --> 01:36:35,883
<i>The kind that makes
parents and studio executives happy.</i>

2163
01:36:59,899 --> 01:37:00,899
Come on, everyone!

2164
01:37:20,294 --> 01:37:21,634
- Come on, Batman!
- No!

2165
01:38:48,048 --> 01:38:51,388
<i>Wow, that was fun!</i>

2166
01:38:51,552 --> 01:38:53,932
<i>Really hope nobody was recording that.</i>

2167
01:38:54,096 --> 01:38:56,676
Let me see. Oh, this thing is on.
This thing is recording.

2167
