1
00:00:03,611 --> 00:00:05,087
Aah! The armenians

2
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:07,257
Know about the money train!
Diro green-Lit your family.

3
00:00:07,258 --> 00:00:10,951
- If we just work together On this thing
- We don't work together On shit anymore.

4
00:00:10,986 --> 00:00:16,166
You had me arrested. You make the case go away. As
long as I'm locked up In here, everything's at risk.

5
00:00:16,167 --> 00:00:19,435
Shane is neck-Deep In armenian
shit. We got to keep him close.

6
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:24,040
Corrine: vic's had this ex-Cop Watching us all
day long, And I don't know what's going on Between

7
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:26,409
I do. He didn't know about
The bogus armenian threat.

8
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,869
Shane was acting out On some bullshit
tip From some banger in county.

9
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,613
I guess one of us Is being lied to.

10
00:00:32,614 --> 00:00:34,884
This is cruz pezuela. This
city Needs cops like you.

11
00:00:34,885 --> 00:00:37,544
I have larger interests
I'd like to protect.

12
00:00:37,545 --> 00:00:42,416
Found out the name Of one of your former employees Who was stealing secrets
- Luis aramboles.

13
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:46,686
Pezuela doesn't know You lost
their blackmail files. No.

14
00:00:46,687 --> 00:00:52,425
What about the files? He sold them to rezian. The
armenians are making a hard Play for your barrio sandbox.

15
00:00:52,426 --> 00:00:55,328
Looks like I'm gonna need you To
get my family Clear of this thing.

16
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:58,498
Make rezian Believe the mexicans
Are the armenians' Worst problem.

17
00:00:58,499 --> 00:01:03,145
Vendrell: This is I.A., baby. It's latino land,
And I know every mexican gang From here to sinaloa,

18
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:09,284
Which means that nothing happens To vic's family Or
you lose the only guy who can Stop your mexican threat.

19
00:01:09,285 --> 00:01:14,429
I got the mexicans thinking That the armenians
are making A power play for the barrio.

20
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:22,785
So, what now? We can just
sit back, Watch the gang war.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,074
Subtitles downloaded from www.OpenSubtitles.org

22
00:01:53,585 --> 00:01:57,585
Bring back memories?

23
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:12,333
On a clear night, you can See guardo's house from
here. Don't worry. I haven't seen his ghost around.

24
00:02:22,249 --> 00:02:28,818
Come on. Who's the amigo? Luis
aramboles. Intel operative For the mexis.

25
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:31,898
He came up here To start some shit.

26
00:02:31,899 --> 00:02:39,896
I told your boss you sold his Box of sins to the
armenians, Which means you're breathing On borrowed time.

27
00:02:39,897 --> 00:02:42,675
He won't believe that. They're
already out Looking for you.

28
00:02:42,676 --> 00:02:47,904
Price on your head
- I could retire. It's time to disappear...

29
00:02:47,905 --> 00:02:53,421
Unless you want me
To just turn you over.

30
00:02:53,422 --> 00:02:59,558
Who's he? Someone who wants to help
you With your travel arrangements.

31
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:10,469
He would never want to see An...
innocent man get killed. Hey. Hey!

32
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,405
You want to give me a clue
What all this is about?

33
00:03:13,406 --> 00:03:19,911
He's the key to defusing The armenian
time bomb You laid At my family's doorstep.

34
00:03:19,912 --> 00:03:25,140
He's the keeper of the intel The mexis are
using To blackmail Their way to the top.

35
00:03:25,141 --> 00:03:26,651
Orwas, Till I helped myself.

36
00:03:26,652 --> 00:03:30,379
And you made it look like this
Prick sold out to the armos.

37
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:38,866
Which lit the fuse for The blood feud we're
stirring up Between rezian And the mexicans.

38
00:03:39,205 --> 00:03:40,264
Nicely done.

39
00:03:40,265 --> 00:03:45,348
Aramboles is the only one Who
can put my face to the grab.

40
00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:46,404
So he's got to go away.

41
00:03:46,405 --> 00:03:51,432
I need you to hook him up With the coyotes we
were using To get lem set up Down in mexico.

42
00:03:51,433 --> 00:03:54,044
Who's he working for? I want
him gone By tomorrow night.

43
00:03:54,045 --> 00:03:56,480
Getting him out of the
country's Not a problem.

44
00:03:56,481 --> 00:04:02,219
Setting him up on a goat farm With money and contacts,
It would be nice to know who And what I'm dealing with.

45
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:10,317
Working with you to protect My family
- I'm down with that.

46
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:18,436
Trusting you? Not there yet.

47
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:31,848
No, that's a mistake. You
should have Come to me first.

48
00:04:31,849 --> 00:04:35,585
This piece of shit Rezian He's
taken something That belongs tome.

49
00:04:35,586 --> 00:04:39,822
So drop a couple of low-Level
Armenian bodies on the street.

50
00:04:39,823 --> 00:04:45,394
Scare them into getting Your blackmail box back,
But trying to whack rezian now Goes too far too fast.

51
00:04:45,395 --> 00:04:51,658
It's already in motion. Be prepared
To help me control the blowback.

52
00:04:51,659 --> 00:05:00,333
When's this going down? Today. We have
some people In county jail where he's at.

53
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:04,670
Look, when all hell breaks loose
Out on the street Because of this...

54
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,850
It's gonna Hurt your business.

55
00:05:07,851 --> 00:05:11,620
And it's gonna hurt my
ability To protect you.

56
00:05:11,621 --> 00:05:19,614
I'm confident you'll be able
To handle the job adequately.

57
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:23,853
Any other questions?

58
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:28,060
Not at the moment.

59
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:30,195
Hey, tina, Have you seen shane?

60
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:32,898
No, haven't had The pleasure today.

61
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:33,641
What the hell is this?

62
00:05:33,642 --> 00:05:39,247
The mayor just released a list Of the top-10 most
wanted gangs To a press conference This morning.

63
00:05:39,248 --> 00:05:42,316
Hey, are we making celebrities
Of these douche bags now?

64
00:05:42,317 --> 00:05:45,252
It's the latest initiative
In the city's war on gangs.

65
00:05:45,253 --> 00:05:48,256
It's just gonna get sets
Competing to move up the ladder.

66
00:05:48,257 --> 00:05:51,392
Gang crime's up 14% Citywide this year.

67
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,551
While farmington's numbers Are down.

68
00:05:53,552 --> 00:05:55,096
I guess I can't be everywhere.

69
00:05:55,097 --> 00:05:57,264
I weighed in against this With phillips.

70
00:05:57,265 --> 00:06:03,103
I was told that the mayor Wants to be proactive In
identifying gang problems To reassure the public.

71
00:06:03,104 --> 00:06:06,307
Well, it made the
front page, So hang on.

72
00:06:06,308 --> 00:06:09,734
Well, fortunately, most of
these Bangers can't read.

73
00:06:09,735 --> 00:06:16,640
Still, I got the over/under On one of these crews Doing
the first whack To move up the list In three hours.

74
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:20,778
I'll take the under. Rumor has it that
you're Scheduled for a new hearing.

75
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:21,521
Four weeks from today.

76
00:06:21,522 --> 00:06:28,461
Well, if you would like to spend That time with
your lawyer, Your pba rep organizing Your case...

77
00:06:28,462 --> 00:06:35,068
As long as I got this, I'm
gonna use it. Nice try, though.

78
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:44,564
Vendrell: arrangements Have been
made. Have aramboles Ready at 10:00.

79
00:06:44,836 --> 00:06:51,089
This war we started is already
Spinning out of control.

80
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:53,553
Mexicans have overreacted.
Rezian's been green-Lit.

81
00:06:53,554 --> 00:06:55,511
They're gonna make a
move Against him tonight.

82
00:06:55,512 --> 00:06:59,316
Protecting rezian Is the only thing
That's keeping Your family alive.

83
00:06:59,317 --> 00:07:02,552
I'm not the one behind this. We need
to get rezian In protective custody.

84
00:07:02,553 --> 00:07:09,549
It's too late for that. He'll be
dead Before the request is processed.

85
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,028
Jesus.

86
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:14,061
Okay.

87
00:07:14,062 --> 00:07:17,133
Okay, maybe... Maybe my
armenian problem Goes away.

88
00:07:17,134 --> 00:07:22,281
With rezian dead, Maybe he's the only armo
Who knows enough about me To hold a grudge.

89
00:07:22,282 --> 00:07:33,549
Or maybe armenian number 2 Knows what rezian
knows And blames us For getting the boss whacked.

90
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,259
You have to warn him.

91
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,729
Yeah, so he can get himself In the
right frame of mind To take a shiv?

92
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:46,829
No, I'll figure out How to head that off. Meanwhile,
you get cred By giving him a heads-Up, And he'll owe you.

93
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,446
How you holding up?

94
00:07:48,447 --> 00:07:51,208
Oatmeal and bologna. I
haven't had a woman In weeks.

95
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:54,936
Well, oatmeal's good For the
colon. You think this is funny?

96
00:07:54,937 --> 00:07:59,640
The d. A.'S Squeezing the accountant
Who did my books at the port.

97
00:07:59,641 --> 00:08:03,982
He agreed to turn evidence. He's
being deposed This afternoon.

98
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:04,812
I'll see what I can do.

99
00:08:04,813 --> 00:08:08,082
Meantime, you got A much bigger problem.

100
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:13,653
I got word That you're hard candy.
You've been green-Lit By the mexicans.

101
00:08:13,654 --> 00:08:14,765
The mexicans? Why?

102
00:08:14,766 --> 00:08:20,628
Look, you just need To watch yourself Until
I can get you Moved into protective custody.

103
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:21,562
I am going to protect you.

104
00:08:21,563 --> 00:08:23,247
You better.

105
00:08:23,248 --> 00:08:24,532
You know why?

106
00:08:24,533 --> 00:08:31,086
Anything happens to me, I've already given
the order to Go after your friend's family.

107
00:08:31,087 --> 00:08:32,015
And yours, too.

108
00:08:32,016 --> 00:08:36,653
If I wanted you dead,
I wouldn't warn you.

109
00:08:36,654 --> 00:08:44,394
Then let's just call it Incentive.

110
00:08:44,395 --> 00:08:47,364
I guess some of these bangers Canread.

111
00:08:47,365 --> 00:08:52,759
Asher: this is john layton, Pasadena
address, No priors, no witnesses,

112
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,771
At least none Of the sharing kind.

113
00:08:54,772 --> 00:08:59,942
What's mr. Layton from pasadena With no priors
doing Walking around This stretch of misery?

114
00:08:59,943 --> 00:09:02,835
Gardocki: gang turf, Upscale victim
- Drugs?

115
00:09:02,836 --> 00:09:05,581
This is not Where
whitey scores his powder.

116
00:09:05,582 --> 00:09:09,051
Century boulevard caters more To the pale
- Face group.

117
00:09:09,052 --> 00:09:12,290
He's got over $100
in cash In his wallet.

118
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:16,916
It's no robbery. Maybe trying to pick up
a trick? The stroll's Six blocks that way.

119
00:09:16,917 --> 00:09:21,521
These tags - Los mags, one
niners - This is gang central.

120
00:09:21,522 --> 00:09:24,090
We all know what this is.
Only difference is, you're the

121
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:28,327
One who has to call the mayor And tell
him that his list Got a white guy popped.

122
00:09:28,328 --> 00:09:31,074
We don't know It's top-10 related.

123
00:09:31,075 --> 00:09:31,584
Drive-By?

124
00:09:31,585 --> 00:09:35,300
Vic: look, this list is like the
Standings in the sports section,

125
00:09:35,301 --> 00:09:38,137
And every gang Is making a playoff push.

126
00:09:38,138 --> 00:09:38,713

129
00:09:53,403 --> 00:09:55,763
How'd rezian Take the bad news?

130
00:09:55,764 --> 00:09:57,799
He's a big believer In life insurance.

131
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:03,962
He gets whacked, they come
after Your familyandmine.

132
00:10:03,963 --> 00:10:07,865
We got to figure out how many
Rungs on the armenian ladder

133
00:10:07,866 --> 00:10:11,453
Know about Our
money-Train rip-Off.

134
00:10:11,454 --> 00:10:12,613
Jesus christ!

135
00:10:12,614 --> 00:10:14,481
How'd we lose control Of this?

136
00:10:14,482 --> 00:10:17,641
Rezian's accountant's
About to give him up.

137
00:10:17,642 --> 00:10:19,944
He expects me To hose him down.

138
00:10:19,945 --> 00:10:23,557
If we don't, That screws us up, too.

139
00:10:23,558 --> 00:10:29,904
The accountant - Later.
Keeping rezian alive - Now.

140
00:10:29,905 --> 00:10:30,988
Vic: moses.

141
00:10:30,989 --> 00:10:35,158
Just crashing by To say, "what up?"

142
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,527
Vendrell: redecorating?

143
00:10:36,528 --> 00:10:39,730
Moses: This is all your boys. Pigs
blew through here Like a damn hurricane.

144

Tossed My breezie's crib, too.

00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:44,244
Shut down my weed spot Around
the way, And I ain't done no harm.

146
00:10:44,245 --> 00:10:46,313
You waking up in the morning Does harm.

147
00:10:46,314 --> 00:10:49,006
Dead bodies on your turf
- Not a good look, moses.

148
00:10:49,007 --> 00:10:51,308
Like I told po-Po, Don't
know nothing about it.

149
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:53,119
Didn't stop them From
messing up my place.

150
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,491
I guess you don't know nothing About
the top-10 list In the paper, either.

151
00:10:57,492 --> 00:10:59,993
I know we reppin' at number
5. I'm good with that.

152
00:10:59,994 --> 00:11:04,554
Blow a hole in a white man, You
get respect, Shot at number 1.

153
00:11:04,555 --> 00:11:07,801
I'm a businessman. And merking white
folk Is a no-Go for my commerce.

154
00:11:07,802 --> 00:11:11,404
What about one of your baby
Bangers trying to earn cred?

155
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:13,506
One of my g's wildin'
out, I'd have heard.

156
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:16,642
There's plenty of nigs out there
Perpetrating felonious bullshit.

157
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:19,545
Why don't you swarm on
them? Stay out of my grill.

158
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:23,890
Who else would pull
a jack move Like this?

159
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:28,078
Athens, piru, spook street. Spook
street Didn't even make the list.

160
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,290
What I'm saying. They need to
step they game up Or they out.

161
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,785
You got any soldiers In county, moses?

162
00:11:35,786 --> 00:11:41,157
Do I got soldiers in county? We straight
claiming county As one nine turf.

163
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:45,327
Got a deal for you. We have
an associate Locked up there.

164
00:11:45,328 --> 00:11:45,904
Needs protecting.

165
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:51,276
I ain't doing jack for you Till this shooter's
gaffled up. Keep the cops out of my shit.

166
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:55,981

sure Our guys back off.

167

You got till 4:00 to make The streets
smooth So I can be about my paper.

168
00:11:59,818 --> 00:12:05,514
Then I'll see about your boy In county.

169
00:12:05,515 --> 00:12:06,190
Deal.

170
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:09,384
Sofer: please get these
people Behind the yellow tape.

171
00:12:09,385 --> 00:12:10,061
Victim's lana boyle.

172
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:13,421
Looks like a cinder
block Fell and killed her.

173
00:12:13,422 --> 00:12:15,366
Wagenbach: Death from above.

174
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:17,734
This is doug obermyer.
Victim's his girlfriend.

175
00:12:17,735 --> 00:12:21,772
I'm detective wagenbach. This is
detective billings. I'm really sorry.

176
00:12:21,773 --> 00:12:23,931
Dude, one of those
assholes Murdered her!

177
00:12:23,932 --> 00:12:25,175
You think This wasn't an accident?

178
00:12:25,176 --> 00:12:28,412
Those goddamned beaners Have been hassling
us Ever since We rented this space.

179
00:12:28,413 --> 00:12:30,514
Um, this is a commercial Building?

180
00:12:30,515 --> 00:12:33,350
It's a rehearsal space.
Lana was our lead singer.

181
00:12:33,351 --> 00:12:35,586
Yeah, rent's cheap In this neighborhood.

182
00:12:35,587 --> 00:12:38,122
The tenants next door
Didn't like the music?

183
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:40,514
It was one of them,
man. They killed her.

184
00:12:40,515 --> 00:12:41,858
You're gonna Arrest somebody, right?

185
00:12:41,859 --> 00:12:44,819
We're gonna talk to people,
Try and determine what happened.

186
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,029
I was out here When it happened!

187
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:49,524
They was yelling out of the
Window, bitching at us to move!

188
00:12:49,525 --> 00:12:50,267
And
- And you didn't?

189
00:12:50,268 --> 00:12:53,670
If they don't like our smoke, They can go
back to mexico city And choke on the smog!

190
00:12:53,671 --> 00:13:01,735
Okay, doug, doug, Don't go away. I
may need To talk to you again, okay?

191
00:13:01,736 --> 00:13:05,072
I wonder if rock-Star boy Is more upset
about losing His girl or his lead singer.

192
00:13:05,073 --> 00:13:10,709
Somebody did drop That cinder block
intentionally, Probably a resident.

193
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:13,446
Maybe still in the crowd.

194
00:13:13,447 --> 00:13:18,818
Oh, right. I'll, uh, get a
read. Don't want to put you out.

195
00:13:18,819 --> 00:13:22,298
I interviewed The boys in the band.
They were all out here When it happened,

196
00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:25,067
But nobody was looking up When the
cinder block Came tumbling down.

197
00:13:25,068 --> 00:13:27,203
The band was just here
Taking a smoke break.

198
00:13:27,204 --> 00:13:29,829
I need you to track down
The building manager.

199
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:35,384
I want every tenant With a window
view of the street Brought down here.

200
00:13:35,385 --> 00:13:38,770
Policia. We need everyone Outside now.

201
00:13:38,771 --> 00:13:39,738
Policia!

202
00:13:39,739 --> 00:13:41,573
Man: QuÃ© carajo estÃ¡s pensando?

203
00:13:41,574 --> 00:13:45,086
Hey! Come on out! We
can hear you in there!

204
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:48,658
Great. We respond to a
murder. We get a domestic.

205
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:53,084
Luna puta! Labre la puerta ahora!

206
00:13:53,085 --> 00:13:56,821
What?! Hey! A little more respect!
And didn't you Hear us knocking?!

207
00:13:56,822 --> 00:13:59,600
Listen up. A girl was killed outside.
We need everyone Downstairs now.

208
00:13:59,601 --> 00:14:02,227
Nothing to do with us.
Icierra la pinche puerta!

209
00:14:02,228 --> 00:14:03,728
Step aside. And you shut up.

210
00:14:03,729 --> 00:14:07,499
Tell your woman To put some clothes on And
get downstairs For questioning right now.

211
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:20,194
Hey! Put your hands
Where I can see them now!

212
00:14:20,195 --> 00:14:26,493
He was getting a shirt To cover
her up Like you asked him to.

213
00:14:26,494 --> 00:14:30,521
Total news blackout On anything
gang-Related Until further notice.

214
00:14:30,522 --> 00:14:34,459
Wouldn't have anything to do With the
businessman Being shot this morning?

215
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,994
Whatever the reason, Something
like this happens, It's a tragedy.

216
00:14:36,995 --> 00:14:38,372
And the timing Couldn't be worse.

217
00:14:38,373 --> 00:14:41,375
And because the mayor doesn't
Want to fuel speculation

218
00:14:41,376 --> 00:14:43,911
That his gangbanger hall
of fame Is the cause.

219
00:14:43,912 --> 00:14:46,704
Who's working the case? Strike team.

220
00:14:46,705 --> 00:14:48,339
Mackey in the mix?
Front and center. Good.

221
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,974
Oh, don't tell me you're
Drinking his kool-Aid now, too.

222
00:14:50,975 --> 00:14:53,576
Am I the only one Who will rember

223
00:14:53,577 --> 00:14:56,489
The trail His tornado left behind If
and when he's finally Thrown out of here?

224
00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:05,755
I'm under no illusions, But a day
like this one? I can live with him.

225
00:15:05,756 --> 00:15:06,689
Who's that guy?

226
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:09,258
Jamal Just replaced trinitron
As the number-One shot-Caller

227
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:13,963
For spook street, Although he claims
to be just Another downtrodden black man

228
00:15:13,964 --> 00:15:19,211
In the struggle. Join the club.

229
00:15:19,212 --> 00:15:22,795
You know what the street's
Saying about your set?

230
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:26,685
Calling you the clown posse, As
in laughingatyou, Not with you.

231
00:15:26,686 --> 00:15:30,146
Hauling me out of bed without
Letting me take my calm pills.

232
00:15:30,147 --> 00:15:31,597
Spook street's a joke.

233
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:34,093
They in my pocket. Forget
to take them Yesterday, too.

234
00:15:34,094 --> 00:15:35,294
And y'all are making me On edge.

235
00:15:35,295 --> 00:15:39,489
Hey, my wife

236
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:41,657
Maybe I should Get you a tampon, too.

237
00:15:41,658 --> 00:15:44,126
You gave the order To
merk that white guy,

238
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,438
Let people know that Spook
street's still around.

239
00:15:46,439 --> 00:15:48,673
Maybe you can get spook
street On that top-10 list.

240
00:15:48,674 --> 00:15:51,042
Hell, they could put
together A top-100 list.

241
00:15:51,043 --> 00:15:53,011
Your piece-Of-Shit
crew Wouldn't be on it.

242
00:15:53,012 --> 00:15:55,280
How am I trying to beef with
Some white dude I never seen?

243
00:15:55,281 --> 00:15:57,182
Maybe you were just
trying to Lay down the law,

244
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,708
Trying to get your
soldiers To come correct,

245
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:03,378
Pasadena square biz Walks
into your line of fire...

246
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,429

Maybe one of the guys in your

00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,750
Crew has an itchy finger, We can help.

248
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:15,324
All you got to do Is tell us the truth.

249
00:16:15,325 --> 00:16:22,179
Man, I got kids to feed... Another
one on the way. My moms is dying.

250
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,141
I ain't a clown. I ain't a bitch.

251
00:16:24,142 --> 00:16:28,503
Just trying to look out
For my own, make my way.

252
00:16:28,504 --> 00:16:29,013
A man of peace.

253
00:16:29,014 --> 00:16:35,191
With the most high As my
witness, I didn't shoot no man.

254
00:16:35,192 --> 00:16:36,744
Don't know about no shooting.

255
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:45,319
Now, please, Can I have my pills?

256
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,566
Any gang presence In the building -
Young men, tattoos, Baggy t-Shirts?

257
00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:52,976
Yeah, I know what
gang members Look like.

258
00:16:52,977 --> 00:16:56,540
Nah, it's mostly families. They pay their
rents on time, And they keep to themselves.

259
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:59,332
Complaints about the noise
And the smoking next door -

260
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,011
Anybody Particularly more upset?

261
00:17:01,012 --> 00:17:02,957
Nobody's complained to
me, And I can't think

262
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,938
Of anybody here Who would
do anything Like this.

263
00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:07,307
Where were you When it happened?

264
00:17:07,308 --> 00:17:12,112
At the hardware store To get a
pipe fixture For a broken toilet.

265
00:17:12,113 --> 00:17:16,783
Um, thanks. I'm gonna need
that tenant list. Sure.

266
00:17:16,784 --> 00:17:20,571

number, No, thanks to you.

270
00:17:28,061 --> 00:17:31,416
Um... If this is the billings level

271
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:34,610
Of effort I can look forward
to, You may as well just go home.

272
00:17:34,611 --> 00:17:36,469
No, me interviewing A witness

273
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,913

274
00:17:37,914 --> 00:17:41,717
I'm the only one working
At maximum capacity.

275
00:17:41,718 --> 00:17:44,510
Really? What did you
Come up with so far?

276
00:17:44,511 --> 00:17:46,612
Sofer: hey, dutch, I
talked to every tenant

277

With an apartment On
this side of the street,

278
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:51,450
And every single one of them
Says they didn't see anything.

279
00:17:51,451 --> 00:17:53,686
Hanlon: Same here. Looks

282
00:17:58,057 --> 00:18:00,668
Young woman Got her head bashed in.

283
00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:02,594
You're not disturbed By the apathy?

284
00:18:02,595 --> 00:18:04,296
Why don't you Take a look around you?

285
00:18:04,297 --> 00:18:07,232

hot sun for how long now,

00:20:28,313 --> 00:20:29,614
Now, call up your boys In county.

338
00:20:44,341 --> 00:20:45,874
You didn't see What happened?

339
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,352

Busy day. What's going on?

348
00:21:12,344 --> 00:21:16,071
Why do you have somebody
Watching us and following us?

349
00:21:16,072 --> 00:21:18,640
You didn't get a tip From
some banger in county.

350
00:21:18,641 --> 00:21:21,652
Mara told me About the whole armenian
thing You and shane Are mixed up with.

351
00:21:21,653 --> 00:21:22,744
Now, what's the truth?

do this here, okay? Come on.

I'm handling it.

356
00:21:33,832 --> 00:21:38,641
Oh, handling it is by tying
up Mara and gagging her?

357
00:21:38,642 --> 00:21:40,595
That's a gross exaggeration.

358
00:21:40,596 --> 00:21:43,440
Look, shane got Both of
our families in a jam,

359

Believe me, you don't
want To know the details.

364
00:21:56,544 --> 00:21:58,055
Now, Shane used bad judgment.

365
00:21:58,056 --> 00:22:00,693
That's why you have
some ex-Cop Following me?

366

might be going down.

370
00:22:13,437 --> 00:22:15,638

anyone Hurt you or my children,

375
00:22:27,942 --> 00:22:30,591
You don't know me.

376
00:22:30,592 --> 00:22:31,945
Do you work here?

377
00:22:31,946 --> 00:22:34,123
Eight hours a day, Minus
half-Hour for lunch.

00:22:34,124 --> 00:22:36,559
You need some change
For the vending machine?

Wyms: got a call claiming
Responsibility for the murders.

383

We already know It's spook street.

384
00:22:47,303 --> 00:22:53,316

Street working with al-Qaeda.

385
00:22:53,317 --> 00:22:56,168
Al-Qaeda in the hood? This is serious.

386
00:22:56,169 --> 00:22:59,921
Knock yourself out. But it's bullshit.

387
00:22:59,922 --> 00:23:01,840
I've seen the fbi report.
There's internet chatter.

388
00:23:01,841 --> 00:23:05,110
Terrorist groups Are trying to get
in business With local street gangs.

389

To gang members Who deal drugs and weapons
- How is that a stretch?

393
00:23:18,467 --> 00:23:23,838
Look, we spend all day, Every day, in the

Noses in the carpet, Facing mecca,

He recants his previous Statements to us
under duress, An armenian mob boss Goes free.

443
00:26:24,272 --> 00:26:26,639
Now, you want that On
your rÃ©sumÃ©, rookie?

444
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,375
Look, you're just Trying to do your job.

445
00:26:29,376 --> 00:26:32,612
Why don't you Come in
with me? Hi, mr. Grubman.

446
00:26:32,613 --> 00:26:35,715
U're the cop Who arrested rezian.

447
00:26:35,716 --> 00:26:37,051
Vendrell: yes, I was.

448
00:26:37,052 --> 00:26:39,020
They have you down here today, too?

449
00:26:39,021 --> 00:26:40,887
I'm always working.

450
00:26:40,888 --> 00:26:44,526
I, uh... I came to
thank you for testifying.

451
00:26:44,527 --> 00:26:47,061
We're very confident in
our case against mr. Rezian.

452
00:26:47,062 --> 00:26:48,929
Just trying to do the right thing.

453
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:53,766
Is there anything else that we can
get you To make you more comfortable?

454
00:26:53,767 --> 00:26:54,769
No, I'm fine.

455
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:58,237
And we'd all like for
it to stay that way.

456
00:26:58,238 --> 00:27:00,308
Okay.

457
00:27:00,309 --> 00:27:02,918
We don't want you to have
any fears about testifying.

458
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:07,130
We're not gonna let any harm come to
you Or your daughter down in anaheim.

459
00:27:07,131 --> 00:27:08,190
My daughter?

460
00:27:08,191 --> 00:27:10,451
Well, when we heard
about the death threat,

461
00:27:10,452 --> 00:27:14,452
We took every precaution to
guarantee katrona's safety.

462
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:20,160
You have my word.

463
00:27:20,161 --> 00:27:24,161
Now, is there any part
of your testimony...

464
00:27:24,265 --> 00:27:28,265
That you would like to go
over so that we're clear?

465
00:27:28,467 --> 00:27:30,136
No.

466
00:27:30,137 --> 00:27:34,137
I'm perfectly clear
on what I need to say.

467
00:27:34,768 --> 00:27:39,477
Great.

468
00:27:45,885 --> 00:27:46,227
Vic: uh...

469
00:27:46,228 --> 00:27:53,234
I might be able to help I. C.E. Think
locally and act globally. You interested?

470
00:27:53,235 --> 00:27:55,869
I'm a big-Picture gal.
Of course I'm interested.

471
00:27:55,870 --> 00:28:00,698
Look, I got the name and address Of
an illegal alien Who's running weapons.

472
00:28:00,699 --> 00:28:06,213
He's a fired Mexican intel op Who's a
possible connection To a local power player.

473
00:28:06,214 --> 00:28:12,473
Now, this goes international,
Be better for you than me.

474
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:16,379
What's his name?

475
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,414
Aramboles?

476
00:28:17,415 --> 00:28:19,867
Don't know him.

477
00:28:19,868 --> 00:28:21,185
You're about to.

478
00:28:21,186 --> 00:28:27,233
I'd get there now
Before someone else does.

479
00:28:27,234 --> 00:28:29,969
Grubman's got a bad case Of amnesia.

480
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:30,636
What about rezian in jail?

481
00:28:30,637 --> 00:28:32,305
Well, he's still
alive, As far as I know.

482
00:28:32,306 --> 00:28:34,874
Can't really call him up And ask
And hour later, He takes a knife.

483
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:38,835
Yeah, well, just have to trust That
moses' guys Are gonna keep him breathing.

484
00:28:38,836 --> 00:28:40,970
Sofer: Claudette needs to see you.

485
00:28:40,971 --> 00:28:44,971
In a sec.

486
00:28:53,368 --> 00:28:54,784
Not you. Shane.

487
00:28:54,785 --> 00:28:55,785
Uh, you beckoned?

488
00:28:55,786 --> 00:29:01,223
I got a call from the d. A., Said you just
visited the Witness, rezian's bookkeeper?

489
00:29:01,224 --> 00:29:01,400
Yeah.

490
00:29:01,401 --> 00:29:04,647
Yeah, my jailhouse chats With
rezian, He didn't seem too worried

491
00:29:04,648 --> 00:29:07,472
About grubman as a witness, Which
didn't give me A good feeling.

492
00:29:07,473 --> 00:29:09,774
You didn't talk to grubman
About his testimony, did you?

493
00:29:09,775 --> 00:29:12,567
Just to make sure he wasn't
Being pressured in any way.

494
00:29:12,568 --> 00:29:15,270
Sheriff's deputy Was
present the whole time.

495
00:29:15,271 --> 00:29:17,382
I know. I just spoke with her.

496
00:29:17,383 --> 00:29:19,774
Grubman's changed his story.
He's recanted everything.

497
00:29:19,775 --> 00:29:21,386
Shit. Rezian got to him.

498
00:29:21,387 --> 00:29:24,255
D. A. Wants to talk to you, Make
sure You didn't have a hand in it.

499
00:29:24,256 --> 00:29:28,082
How does it benefit me to lose a
High-Profile collar like rezian?

500
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:30,419
I haven't Figured that out yet.

501
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:37,690
Well, tell the d. A. I'm
available To talk to him anytime.

502
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,329
Hanlon: dutch.

503
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:43,465
Look, I've spoken To
my people twice now.

504
00:29:43,466 --> 00:29:45,600
Is there a chance That
nobody saw anything?

505
00:29:45,601 --> 00:29:47,712
No, see, some people
Would rather stay cowards,

506
00:29:47,713 --> 00:29:50,948
Keep their mouths shut, and
not Put themselves on the line.

507
00:29:50,949 --> 00:29:55,176
You got a problem with me? Because if
you do, why don't you Just let it out now?

508
00:29:55,177 --> 00:29:59,146
You tell me. Or you gonna Keep your
mouth shut Like the rest Of these people?

509
00:29:59,147 --> 00:30:01,025
Right. Right. Unis are
saying That you blame me

510
00:30:01,026 --> 00:30:03,627
Because the guy cut out the
back At the army-Surplus bust.

511
00:30:03,628 --> 00:30:05,262
Is that what all this
Roundabout shit is?

512
00:30:05,263 --> 00:30:06,463
Where there's smoke, There's fire.

513
00:30:06,464 --> 00:30:09,766
You didn't clear a room, and
A cop could have gotten hurt.

514
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:11,802
I cleared the rooms I
was supposed to clear.

515
00:30:11,803 --> 00:30:15,095
You want to think it was me
Because you don't like me?

516
00:30:15,096 --> 00:30:15,429
Fine.

517
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,340
But it was you Who
pulled out a gun today

518
00:30:17,341 --> 00:30:24,869
Because you didn't think
That I can handle the job.

519
00:30:25,707 --> 00:30:28,533
Or were you just scared?

520
00:30:28,534 --> 00:30:37,750
Guess we should all,
uh... Get back at it.

521
00:30:37,751 --> 00:30:38,674
You lil b. K?

522
00:30:38,675 --> 00:30:39,285
Who "axing"?

523
00:30:39,286 --> 00:30:43,032
Jamal "axing" From the joint.

524
00:30:43,033 --> 00:30:46,360
Mal ain't trying to put my name
In his mouth, Talking to no police.

525
00:30:46,361 --> 00:30:49,554
You called his cell Right
before he was arrested.

526
00:30:49,555 --> 00:30:50,372
I ain't make no call.

527
00:30:50,373 --> 00:30:53,333
Gardocki: your number's On
his phone, little asshole.

528
00:30:53,334 --> 00:30:55,477
Look, a number Ain't
nothing but a number.

529
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:57,446
You want stripes With these 187s,

530
00:30:57,447 --> 00:30:58,814
You got to name them And claim them.

531
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:01,083
No one steps up, spook street
Doesn't make the top 10.

532
00:31:01,084 --> 00:31:03,485
Maybe one niners start
Whispering they're the ones

533
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:06,221
With bowling balls
swinging Between their legs.

534
00:31:06,222 --> 00:31:09,046
Or you go down in hood lore
As the punk who earned jamal

535
00:31:09,047 --> 00:31:13,962
A 20-Year stretch As an accessory
for something He knew nothing about...

536
00:31:13,963 --> 00:31:20,435
Since the phone call
ties him To the shootings.

537
00:31:20,436 --> 00:31:27,581
Yeah, it was me and my boys Who blasted
them fools! Jamal wasn't knowing.

538
00:31:27,582 --> 00:31:29,511
It was myowningenuity shit. Myshit!

539
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:36,642
So, what we gonna do now, Slow man?

540
00:31:36,643 --> 00:31:37,452
Man...

541
00:31:41,147 --> 00:31:42,246
Reppin'

542
00:31:42,247 --> 00:31:46,035
That spook street, my
nig! That's what's up!

543
00:31:46,036 --> 00:31:49,211
S- P-To the double-O-K!
Yo, take my picture!

544
00:31:49,212 --> 00:31:51,257
I merked them slobs straight up!

545
00:31:51,258 --> 00:32:04,999
Spook street!

546
00:32:06,173 --> 00:32:15,409
Spook street!

547
00:32:16,622 --> 00:32:18,038
Meet al-Qaeda's

548
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:18,973
Number two and three.

549
00:32:18,974 --> 00:32:25,478
Want me to call juvie, Or
you want to waterboard them?

550
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:27,948
Hey, vic, You got a minute?

551
00:32:27,949 --> 00:32:30,383
Not really.

552
00:32:30,384 --> 00:32:31,728
It's about your daughter.

553
00:32:31,729 --> 00:32:34,787
Cassidy wanted to file
charges Against you today.

554
00:32:34,788 --> 00:32:35,922
She made Some pretty crazy claims.

555
00:32:35,923 --> 00:32:37,066
I just thought You should know.

556
00:32:37,067 --> 00:32:40,660
Said that you assaulted Vendrell's wife?

557
00:32:40,661 --> 00:32:44,698
You don't buy your kids
A cellphone these days,

558
00:32:44,699 --> 00:32:46,632
They want you dead. Who
else did she talk to?

559
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:48,044
Just me. I didn't write it up.

560
00:32:48,045 --> 00:32:50,136
I figured it was just a kid Acting out.

561
00:32:50,137 --> 00:32:52,214
Hey, thanks For the heads-Up.

562
00:32:52,215 --> 00:32:56,609
You know, I got girls of
my own. It's a living hell.

563
00:32:56,610 --> 00:33:03,292
You should take the
time... Talk to her, though.

564
00:33:03,293 --> 00:33:06,128
Wyms: you're not really
thinking Of keeping these people

565
00:33:06,129 --> 00:33:08,020
In the barn overnight, Are you?

566
00:33:08,021 --> 00:33:11,056
I'm allowed 24 hours. As fatigue
sets in, Someone will crack.

567
00:33:11,057 --> 00:33:14,403
You sure This isn't about someone else?

568
00:33:14,404 --> 00:33:16,504
Billings may have gotten
to me A little today.

569
00:33:16,505 --> 00:33:18,840
He's selling them food
From his vending machines.

570
00:33:18,841 --> 00:33:22,317
He hasn't done anything
To help solve this,

571
00:33:22,318 --> 00:33:23,702
And he's making a profit.

572
00:33:23,703 --> 00:33:24,279
You deal with it.

573
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,681
If he sees his lawsuit
through To the bitter end,

574
00:33:26,682 --> 00:33:33,208
He's not going anywhere Any time soon.

575
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:37,525
And send these people home.

576
00:33:37,526 --> 00:33:39,884
If you made one move that
Even approached competence,

577
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:41,195
This would look A lot different.

578
00:33:41,196 --> 00:33:44,765
You think I don't know How you and
missus feel, That you want me to quit?

579
00:33:44,766 --> 00:33:46,758
Well, I'm getting my pension
- Every penny of it.

580
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:48,293
God! Is that Allyou want?

581
00:33:48,294 --> 00:33:52,330
Billings: that and The
tiniest bit of respect.

582
00:33:52,331 --> 00:33:52,997
For what, steve?

583
00:33:52,998 --> 00:33:57,044
You give that To a man - Respect -
You earn his hard work And loyalty.

584
00:33:57,045 --> 00:33:59,313
That's what management
here Doesn't understand.

585
00:33:59,314 --> 00:34:00,805
You show a little
R- E- S- P- E-C-T,

586
00:34:00,806 --> 00:34:04,375
And people will do Almost anything to...

587
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:08,429
Nacio. The building manager.

588
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:09,280
Wagenbach: nacio?

589
00:34:09,315 --> 00:34:11,892
You assume people Are indifferent, lazy.

590
00:34:11,893 --> 00:34:21,925
Maybe they just found
someone Worth protecting.

591
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:26,373
Man: Knock it off!

592
00:34:26,374 --> 00:34:28,775
I'm sorry to have kept
All of you here so long.

593
00:34:28,776 --> 00:34:32,178
It's important to find out
What happened to that girl.

594
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:37,207
I meant to ask you earlier, How long have
you been the Manager of the building, nacio?

595
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:39,376
This august, It'll be one year.

596
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:42,956
Apartment managers Aren't usually
well-Liked. Seems like you are.

597
00:34:42,957 --> 00:34:46,517
Well, I made a lot of
changes Around the building.

598
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:50,162
Get things fixed right away, Even if
it means fighting With the landlord.

599
00:34:50,163 --> 00:34:51,621
It's the little things That matter.

600
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:55,474
Why do you think Nobody's come forward?

601
00:34:55,475 --> 00:34:56,593
They don't know anything.

602
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:59,595
They're worried about The
trouble it could bring.

603
00:34:59,596 --> 00:35:02,599
A lot of them Don't have papers.

604
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,026
Any other reason?

605
00:35:05,027 --> 00:35:08,046
Well, they're mad...
About the noise, the smoke.

606
00:35:08,047 --> 00:35:10,549
They complained to the
police Over and over,

607
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:14,411
But in that neighborhood,
It's tough to get a response.

608
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:18,648
You told me today You didn't know
anything About the complaints.

609
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:21,426
Well, I-I've been Talking to, uh...

610
00:35:21,427 --> 00:35:24,920
The people down here,
Since we were waiting.

611
00:35:24,921 --> 00:35:28,901
Where were you When it happened again?

612
00:35:28,902 --> 00:35:29,924
At the hardware store.

613
00:35:29,925 --> 00:35:30,808
Right.

614
00:35:30,809 --> 00:35:31,536
Broken toilet.

615
00:35:31,537 --> 00:35:33,605
And then you came back Afterthe murder.

616
00:35:33,606 --> 00:35:36,965
And you put the bag With the
pipe down, Came out to talk to us.

617
00:35:36,966 --> 00:35:37,142
Yeah.

618
00:35:37,143 --> 00:35:39,735
So if we drove you back
To the apartment right now,

619
00:35:39,736 --> 00:35:43,438
You could show That bag to us.

620
00:35:43,439 --> 00:35:48,853
If I can rember Where I put
it. It's been a crazy day.

621
00:35:48,854 --> 00:35:51,956
There's an old saying, Nacio

622
00:35:51,957 --> 00:35:55,917
If you never lie, you never
Have to remember anything.

623
00:35:55,918 --> 00:35:59,330
I don't think You meant to kill lana.

624
00:35:59,331 --> 00:36:02,934
Look, it was your building.
You worked hard to keep it nice.

625
00:36:02,935 --> 00:36:06,136
Probably asked those rockers Politely.

626
00:36:06,137 --> 00:36:07,438
But they didn't listen, Did they?

627
00:36:07,439 --> 00:36:13,535
What were you trying to do with
The cinder block, scare them?

628
00:36:13,536 --> 00:36:15,555
You killed someone, nacio.

629
00:36:15,556 --> 00:36:17,372
You didn't intend to...

630
00:36:17,373 --> 00:36:17,782
But you did.

631
00:36:17,783 --> 00:36:22,253
And all those people out there
Aren't talking for one reason.

632
00:36:22,254 --> 00:36:28,282
Because you're the only guy that
Makes their lives any better.

633
00:36:28,283 --> 00:36:38,091
Isn't it time To send those people home?

634
00:36:38,092 --> 00:36:38,935
Where's the boy's mother?

635
00:36:38,936 --> 00:36:42,205
Suckingyourman's dick
'Cause you won't, bitch.

636
00:36:42,206 --> 00:36:44,998
Man: I've advised my client
Not to answer any questions.

637
00:36:44,999 --> 00:36:47,677
Shit, nigga, I got something to say.

638
00:36:47,678 --> 00:36:53,283
We smoked them fools All
day long, All three of them.

639
00:36:53,284 --> 00:36:53,516
Why?

640
00:36:53,517 --> 00:36:56,409
Just paying the white devil His due.

641
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:57,110
No more talk.

642
00:36:57,111 --> 00:37:00,623
You working My last nerve, nigga.

643
00:37:00,624 --> 00:37:04,493
We was bringing the ghetto
Heisman back to spook street.

644
00:37:04,494 --> 00:37:05,318
Like back in the day.

645
00:37:05,319 --> 00:37:06,920
You realize That killing innocent people

646
00:37:06,921 --> 00:37:11,123
Because of the color Of
their skin is a hate crime?

647
00:37:11,124 --> 00:37:13,360
You say it Like I give a shit, nigga.

648
00:37:13,361 --> 00:37:18,263
Haters taught hate.
That's why I bang it.

649
00:37:18,264 --> 00:37:21,067
This word You're so fond of using -

650
00:37:21,068 --> 00:37:23,669
You're one of them "n-Word"
Type of bitches, huh?

651
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:26,615
You use that word, You
turn a person into a thing.

652
00:37:26,616 --> 00:37:30,309
Makes it easier for you to
Rob them, hate them, kill them.

653
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:34,322
Do I got to listen To this church
up in here From this nigga bitch?!

654
00:37:34,323 --> 00:37:40,161
Do you realize how many Black
folks have fought and died

655
00:37:40,162 --> 00:37:44,322
To give us the opportunity
They never had?!

656
00:37:44,323 --> 00:37:45,323
Mm, four? Five?

657
00:37:45,324 --> 00:37:47,768
Not only Have you taken innocent lives,

658
00:37:47,769 --> 00:37:50,662
But you turned yourself Into athing.

659
00:37:50,663 --> 00:37:53,141
You can't Even say the word, bitch.

660
00:37:53,142 --> 00:37:57,101
White man even got you
talking By his rules now.

661
00:37:57,102 --> 00:37:57,835
Straight up.

662
00:37:57,836 --> 00:38:00,371
I wouldn't Waste the word "nigger"

663
00:38:00,372 --> 00:38:04,852
On someone As empty and godless as you.

664
00:38:04,853 --> 00:38:11,592
Too many of our people Have died
Being treated like niggers...

665
00:38:11,593 --> 00:38:18,198
For me to belittle Their suffering.

666
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:20,491
Yo, just make sure The streets know

667
00:38:20,492 --> 00:38:26,011
Spook street nigs Merkedthem devils!

668
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,718
Againstme?

669
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:33,399
They're alleging that you used A racist
epithet To intimidate And harass the suspect.

670
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:33,990
It didn't happen.

671
00:38:33,991 --> 00:38:36,235
The lawyer Said he witnessed it.

672
00:38:36,236 --> 00:38:40,513
Oh, he's taking what I said
Completely out of context.

673
00:38:40,514 --> 00:38:41,541
So, youdiduse the word.

674
00:38:41,542 --> 00:38:51,422
Some crack-Baby tweener Does a triple homicide,
And I'm the one Being held over a barrel?

675
00:38:51,423 --> 00:38:52,951
You let him get to you.

676
00:38:52,952 --> 00:38:55,621
Listen, all that's gonna Come of this

677
00:38:55,622 --> 00:39:02,785
Is a rainforest worth Of
paperwork And some chest-Thumping.

678
00:39:02,786 --> 00:39:06,467
At my expense.

679
00:39:06,468 --> 00:39:07,566
I'll look at it for you.

680
00:39:07,567 --> 00:39:11,103
You ever feel like you're being
Pulled right back into something

681
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:14,463
That you have worked so
hard for For so long -

682
00:39:14,464 --> 00:39:16,240
Don't even go there. I
got to work out a plea.

683
00:39:16,241 --> 00:39:19,344
The defendant dumped
Boiling water on her baby

684
00:39:19,345 --> 00:39:24,840
Because the father came home
With a hickey on his neck.

685
00:39:24,841 --> 00:39:33,360
Tell mackey and his guys Good collar.

686
00:39:33,361 --> 00:39:34,623
Hey.

687
00:39:34,624 --> 00:39:36,140
That had to hurt.

688
00:39:36,141 --> 00:39:37,252
Everything hurts.

689
00:39:37,253 --> 00:39:38,062
New meds doing anything?

690
00:39:38,063 --> 00:39:43,024
Beside the fact they make you
Want to jump out of your skin.

691
00:39:43,025 --> 00:39:44,358
I heard your guy confessed.

692
00:39:44,359 --> 00:39:44,769
Yeah.

693
00:39:44,804 --> 00:39:48,028
Brass have to be pleased To get
these killer kids Off the street.

694
00:39:48,029 --> 00:39:49,106
No, no, They're too busy

695
00:39:49,107 --> 00:39:52,076
Trying to plot how to hang me
Out to dry for being a racist.

696
00:39:52,077 --> 00:39:56,003
Deflect attention from their
Al-Qaeda thing not panning out.

697
00:39:56,004 --> 00:39:59,406
So, uh, You're a racist now?

698
00:39:59,407 --> 00:40:03,277
How's that Working out for you?

699
00:40:03,278 --> 00:40:04,822
Vic: Those are federal agents

700
00:40:04,823 --> 00:40:07,224
Finding your arsenal Of illegal weapons.

701
00:40:07,225 --> 00:40:10,761
With enhancements, that ought
To earn you 18 to 25 years.

702
00:40:10,762 --> 00:40:12,896
On another front, Your boss thinks

703
00:40:12,897 --> 00:40:15,699
You sold his blackmail
intel To the armenians.

704
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:18,492
That's the definition Of a bad day.

705
00:40:18,493 --> 00:40:21,295
Coyote's waiting To take you across.

706
00:40:21,296 --> 00:40:27,001
Even found you a casa With
a little mountain view.

707
00:40:27,002 --> 00:40:28,335
You like goat's milk?

708
00:40:28,336 --> 00:40:29,346
I got your boss so worked up,

709
00:40:29,347 --> 00:40:33,173
His orders were for me
To shoot you on sight.

710
00:40:33,174 --> 00:40:36,043
You ever Try to come back
here, It'll be a race between

711
00:40:36,044 --> 00:40:38,921
The feds, the cartel,
and me To catch your ass.

712
00:40:38,922 --> 00:40:53,092
The feds and the cartel catch
You first, you'll be lucky.

713
00:40:53,093 --> 00:40:58,298
Vendrell: Hasta la vista, shithead.

714
00:40:58,299 --> 00:41:04,146
Now we just need moses to come
Through on the rezian front.

715
00:41:04,147 --> 00:41:10,052
You and me
- We're on the road To being cool, right?

716
00:41:10,053 --> 00:41:12,888
Look, I handled aramboles For you.

717
00:41:12,889 --> 00:41:19,027
I saved your wife and
kid From an assassin.

718
00:41:19,028 --> 00:41:23,164
I'm not your whipping boy For life, man.

719
00:41:23,165 --> 00:41:28,103
That's what you got Ronnie for.

720
00:41:28,104 --> 00:41:30,629
Mara ran her mouth To corrine,

721
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:33,665
Got her all revved up
About this armenian crap.

722
00:41:33,666 --> 00:41:35,610
I don't need her Starting trouble

723
00:41:35,611 --> 00:41:41,072
When I'm dealing with shit
Coming out of both of my ears.

724
00:41:41,073 --> 00:41:42,407
Handle your wife.

725
00:41:42,408 --> 00:41:46,477
And as far as you Making it
sound like I oweyoufor anything -

726
00:41:46,478 --> 00:41:50,057
County jail. Yeah. Okay.

727
00:41:50,058 --> 00:41:51,859
I hold you responsible For this.

728
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:55,953
Who do you think made sure the
Mexicans didn't finish the job?

729
00:41:55,954 --> 00:41:57,698
I warned you About the threat.

730
00:41:57,699 --> 00:42:00,934
I put those bangers on
The payroll to protect you.

731
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:03,977
'Cause those brothers Sure
as hell Didn't pull that

732
00:42:03,978 --> 00:42:09,701
Shiv-Wieldingeseoff your ass To fulfill
some Community-Service requirement.

733
00:42:09,702 --> 00:42:11,702
I want the mexican Who did this to me.

734
00:42:11,703 --> 00:42:13,780
I don't even know That
the orderwasmexican.

735
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,949
The latino crime bosses
Need you out of the way

736
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:19,152
So that they can get on
With their brown revolution.

737
00:42:19,153 --> 00:42:23,757
But diro is my first choice,
As previously discussed.

738
00:42:23,758 --> 00:42:26,192
And I wouldn't rule
somebody out In yourowncircle

739
00:42:26,193 --> 00:42:28,385
Looking to spread Their wings.

740
00:42:28,386 --> 00:42:29,686
I want who did this to me.

741
00:42:29,687 --> 00:42:31,355
Well, I'll get right on that.

742
00:42:31,356 --> 00:42:34,934
But the one thing That
we did learn tonight -

743
00:42:34,935 --> 00:42:44,591
I may be the only friend
That you can trust now.

744
00:42:49,424 --> 00:42:51,240
Vic: aramboles vanished.

745
00:42:51,241 --> 00:42:51,450
Where?

746
00:42:51,451 --> 00:42:54,286
It looks like he took the
money From selling your intel

747
00:42:54,287 --> 00:43:00,149
And booked himself A sea cruise.
Been a bad 24 hours for you.

748
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:05,154
You lost aramboles. Your
hit on rezian failed.

749
00:43:05,155 --> 00:43:08,991
He's walking. He's one
pissed-Off Eastern euro peon.

750
00:43:08,992 --> 00:43:14,497
He'll be harder To get to now.

751
00:43:14,498 --> 00:43:19,768
I can help. But this
30-Day-Trial bullshit Is over.

752
00:43:19,769 --> 00:43:21,671
I want tenure.

753
00:43:21,672 --> 00:43:23,588
You owe me for your badge.

754
00:43:23,589 --> 00:43:28,810
You got my hearing delayed.
I found out who aramboles

755
00:43:28,845 --> 00:43:29,645
Was flipping your intel to. Even steven.

756
00:43:29,646 --> 00:43:37,668
Anything else Is subject to my
availability And new negotiations.

757
00:43:37,669 --> 00:43:38,563
10 grand a week.

758
00:43:38,564 --> 00:43:44,191
Any attacks on the armos
Go through me first.

759
00:43:44,192 --> 00:43:45,760
And no civilians get killed.

760
00:43:45,761 --> 00:43:46,427
Wars are messy.

761
00:43:46,428 --> 00:43:48,729
I like a buck As much as the next guy.

762
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:50,265
Can't feel good About spending it

763
00:43:50,266 --> 00:43:55,403
When some schoolgirl's
Collateral damage in a drive-By.

764
00:43:55,404 --> 00:43:58,205
Because you've got morals.

765
00:43:58,206 --> 00:43:59,555
A few.

766
00:43:59,556 --> 00:44:00,951
$10,000 is a lot...

767
00:44:00,952 --> 00:44:04,121
Especially if someone's
morals Might get in the way.

768
00:44:04,122 --> 00:44:08,325
A call girl gets a fraction of
That to leave hers at the door.

769
00:44:08,326 --> 00:44:11,529
Then get your answers From a hooker.

770
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:15,198
I don't like being told
How to conduct my business.

771
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:19,436
Only two things I know
About how you make a living -

772
00:44:19,437 --> 00:44:24,174
Employees get well paid To get their
hands dirty So you don't have to.

773
00:44:24,175 --> 00:44:31,712
And before you raise up A new building,
The old one has to get torn down.

774
00:44:31,713 --> 00:44:32,882
So?

775
00:44:32,883 --> 00:44:36,883
So, 10 grand buys you a
one-Man demolition crew.

776
00:44:40,058 --> 00:44:42,878
I'll need your answer in the morning.
