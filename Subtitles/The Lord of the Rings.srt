00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:53,716
<i>Long ago...</i>

3
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,707
<i>in the early years
of the Second Age...</i>

4
00:00:57,266 --> 00:01:01,062
<i>the great Elven-smiths
forged Rings of Power.</i>

5
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,314
<i>Nine for mortal Men.</i>

6
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:08,277
<i>Seven for the Dwarf-lords.</i>

7
00:01:08,444 --> 00:01:12,698
<i>Three for the tall Elf-kings.</i>

8
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:17,661
<i>But then, the Dark Lord
learned the craft of ring making...</i>

9
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:20,414
<i>and made the Master Ring.</i>

10
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:23,709
<i>The One Ring to rule them all.</i>

11
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:28,339
<i>With the One Ring, Middle-earth is his,
and he cannot be overcome.</i>

12
00:01:30,216 --> 00:01:34,386
<i>As the last alliance of Men and Elves
fell beneath his power...</i>

13
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:39,767
<i>he did not notice the heroic shadow
who slipped in.</i>

14
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:43,979
<i>It was Prince Isildur...</i>

15
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:47,066
<i>of the mighty kings
from across the sea...</i>

16
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:48,609
<i>who took the Ring.</i>

17
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:59,578
<i>But because he did not destroy it,
the spirit of the Dark Lord lived on...</i>

18
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:03,749
<i>and began to take shape,
and grow again.</i>

19
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:08,170
<i>But the Ring had a will of its own,
and a way of slipping from one hand...</i>

20
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:14,468
<i>to be found by another, so that it
might at last get back to its master.</i>

21
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:19,515
<i>And there the Ring lay,
at the bottom of the great river Anduin...</i>

22
00:02:19,682 --> 00:02:22,309
<i>for thousands of years.</i>

23
00:02:24,103 --> 00:02:25,729
<i>During those years...</i>

24
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:30,276
<i>the Dark Lord captured the nine rings
that were made for Men...</i>

25
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:34,280
<i>and turned their owners
into the Ringwraiths:</i>

26
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:39,076
<i>Terrible shadows
under his great shadow...</i>

27
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:43,789
<i>who roamed the world,
searching for the One Ring.</i>

28
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:48,169
<i>In time, the Ring was found.</i>

29
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:51,380
<i>Two friends were fishing
in the Great River one day.</i>

30
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:06,562
- Give us that, Déagol, my love.
- Why, Sméagol?

31
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:11,692
Because it's my birthday,
my love, and I wants it.

32
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:14,820
I have already given you
more than I could afford.

33
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:18,949
- I found this, and I'm going to keep it!
- Oh?

34
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:23,495
Are you indeed, my love?

35
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:34,173
<i>He used the Ring
for thieving, and to find out secrets.</i>

36
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,092
<i>His own people began to despise
the wretched creature...</i>

37
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,346
<i>and to call him Gollum.</i>

38
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:46,977
<i>Tortured and driven by the Ring,
he hid in dark caves...</i>

39
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:49,647
<i>under deep mountains.</i>

40
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:56,528
<i>But the Ring
slipped off Gollum's finger too.</i>

41
00:03:57,363 --> 00:04:03,702
<i>And so it was that Bilbo found it,
during his travels with the Dwarves.</i>

42
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:09,708
Thief, Baggins. Thief!

43
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:13,337
It stole our precious, our precious...

44
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:16,340
Our birthday present.

45
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:23,305
<i>Thief, Baggins. We hates it forever.
We hates it forever.</i>

46
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:26,725
<i>It was Bilbo Baggins, the Hobbit...</i>

47
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:29,561
<i>who took the Ring back to the Shire,
his home.</i>

48
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:32,815
<i>Years later...</i>

49
00:04:32,982 --> 00:04:37,903
<i>Gandalf the Wizard visited Bilbo
on his going-away birthday party.</i>

50
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:48,122
I don't know half of you
half as well as I should like...

51
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:52,084
and I like less than half of you
half as well as you deserve.

52
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:57,047
Well, heh, heh, Frodo, I can see
your Uncle Bilbo hasn't changed much.

53
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,302
And though 111 years
is far too short a time...

54
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:05,097
to live among such admirable Bagginses
and Boffinses, Grubbs...

55
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:07,474
Chubbs, Bracegirdles, Goodbodies...

56
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:11,729
- Bolgers, Hornblowers and Proudfoots...
- Proudfeet.

57
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:16,817
I regret to announce
that this is the end.

58
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,987
I'm going away. I'm leaving.

59
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:21,947
Now.

60
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:23,532
Goodbye.

61
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:27,703
Where did he go?

62
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,801
Gandalf.

63
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:45,929
Have you left the Ring for Frodo,
as we agreed?

64
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:49,975
It's mine, I tell you. It's my own.

65
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:52,102
My precious.

66
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:57,483
It's mine now, and I shall keep it.
I won't give my precious away, I tell you.

67
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:00,235
Do not say that again.

68
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:06,450
Give it to Frodo, and I will look after him.

69
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,752
All right.

70
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,380
I will.

71
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:41,193
<i>Seventeen years
passed sleepily in the Shire.</i>

72
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,592
All right, all right, just a minute.

73
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,517
Gandalf.

74
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:16,228
Greetings, Frodo.

75
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:19,440
Gandalf, it's really you.
Oh, it's been so long.

76
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:25,904
Seventeen years, since Bilbo left.
You look the same as ever, Frodo.

77
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:31,118
- You look older, Gandalf.
- Oh, I've been on a long journey.

78
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:36,248
It's the Ring, isn't it?
Bilbo's funny magic ring.

79
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:39,126
You always used to look like that
when you talked about it.

80
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:42,546
Bilbo's funny ring...

81
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:45,048
that makes you invisible?

82
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:48,302
- Give it to me, Frodo.
- Give you the Ring?

83
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:50,387
For a moment only.

84
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,145
Can you see any markings on it?

85
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:03,150
There are none.
It's quite a plain ring, really.

86
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:06,737
Well, then, look.

87
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,282
Wait.

88
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:12,659
Do you desire it so much already?

89
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:17,206
No, but why ruin it?

90
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:21,460
Because it is altogether evil.

91
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:25,589
It will corrupt and destroy
anyone who wears it...

92
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:28,800
until he passes
into the world of shadows...

93
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:35,098
under the power of Sauron,
the Dark Lord of Mordor.

94
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,267
Not Bilbo?

95
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:43,232
You are the one who has the Ring now.

96
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:55,160
It's...

97
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:58,497
- It's not even warm.
- No.

98
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:01,833
Not even a dragon's fire
could harm that Ring.

99
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:13,845
<i>One Ring to rule them all</i>

100
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:17,099
<i>One Ring to find them</i>

101
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:22,938
<i>One Ring to bring them all
And in the darkness bind them</i>

102
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:26,567
I wish it need not have happened
in my time.

103
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,360
So do I.

104
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:33,198
The enemy still lacks one thing
to give him strength of knowledge...

105
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:37,786
to break all resistance,
and cover all the lands in darkness.

106
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:41,039
He lacks the One Ring.

107
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,208
But maybe he doesn't
know that it was found.

108
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,335
He knows, Frodo.

109
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,879
Gollum left his cave
to follow the Ring himself...

110
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,882
and the Dark Lord caught him
in Mordor.

111
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:55,971
The Dark Lord knows what ring it was
Gollum found, and how he lost it again.

112
00:09:56,138 --> 00:10:01,393
And he has heard of Hobbits at last,
and of the Shire.

113
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,980
And he even has a name to think about.

114
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:07,941
The name of Baggins.

115
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:15,741
Because of Gollum.

116
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,910
Oh, Gandalf, what am I to do?

117
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:24,082
What a pity that Bilbo didn't kill
that vile creature when he had the chance.

118
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,960
Yes, it was pity.

119
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:30,088
Pity and mercy.

120
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:32,758
And now, Frodo...

121
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:36,261
the decision lies with you.

122
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:40,849
What will you do with the One Ring?

123
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,937
I'll give it to you, Gandalf.

124
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:49,191
You're wise and powerful.
What, will you not...

125
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:52,361
No. Do not tempt me.

126
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:55,947
I would wish to turn it to good,
and it cannot be used so.

127
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:59,951
Meaning to be kind, I would become
as terrible as the Dark Lord himself.

128
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,079
Do not tempt me.

129
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:07,709
I shall have such need of strength
so soon.

130
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,966
Then I suppose I must keep the Ring
and guard it.

131
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:19,137
And I ought to
go away somewhere, alone.

132
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:24,309
But they won't... They won't
bother the Shire if the Ring isn't here.

133
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,439
My dear Frodo...

134
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:33,193
I am afraid you are right.

135
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,322
You'll have to go and leave the name
of Baggins behind you.

136
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:39,908
That name is no longer safe.

137
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,579
Your new traveling name shall be...

138
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:50,877
Mr. Underhill.

139
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:58,677
What have you heard,
and why did you listen?

140
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:01,096
Mr. Frodo, sir, don't let him hurt me, sir!

141
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:03,515
Don't let him turn me
into anything unnatural.

142
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:06,768
- Well?
- Answer him, Sam.

143
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:09,730
Well, sir, I heard a deal
that I didn't rightly understand...

144
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:13,775
about an enemy and rings,
and about Elves, sir.

145
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:17,612
Why, I would dearly love to see Elves,
Mr. Frodo.

146
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:20,365
And so you shall, Sam.

147
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:26,872
So you shall. Indeed, you should go
to the Elves first, to Rivendell.

148
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:28,749
Tell everyone you are moving away...

149
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:33,295
to live in Buckleberry, with those cousins
of yours, Pippin and Merry.

150
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:38,341
However you manage it, do it soon,
by your birthday at the latest.

151
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:40,427
I should be back by then.

152
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:43,346
I must go south,
to consult with the wizard Aruman...

153
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:47,392
the head of my order.
Be careful, Frodo.

154
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:54,065
Me go, sir? Me go and see the Elves?

155
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:55,567
Oh, my.

156
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,689
I have come for your aid,
Saruman the White, in troubled times.

157
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:38,902
The Nine are abroad.
Darkness approaches, the Black Riders.

158
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:42,239
Is that all the news
you have for me, then?

159
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:46,535
Is that not enough?
Sauron is moving at last.

160
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:53,625
We can deal with Sauron ourselves,
Gandalf. You and I.

161
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:55,836
One way or another.

162
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:01,216
What talk is this?
What are you saying, Saruman?

163
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,594
It is time for us to choose.

164
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:09,599
A new age is upon us.
A new power is rising.

165
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:14,354
Nothing that Men or Elves or Wizards
can do will avail against it.

166
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:20,527
Its enemies are utterly doomed,
but its friends, ah...

167
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:27,534
You are saying that we should join
with Mordor? With him?

168
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:31,496
Does that displease you?
Where is the Ring, Gandalf?

169
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:34,708
Why do the Black Riders
search for it in the Shire?

170
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,543
Have you hidden it there?

171
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,504
Would you rather see
the Dark Lord have it...

172
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:43,383
or Saruman of many colors?

173
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:48,722
Neither of you will have it.

174
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:55,478
There is a third choice.

175
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,943
It is to remain here...

176
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:06,281
until you tell me
where the Ring may be found.

177
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:08,491
Saruman, if you do this...

178
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:12,287
if you delay me here,
Sauron will surely get it then.

179
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:19,419
Then he will know his good servants...

180
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,925
and his enemies.

181
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:30,764
Saruman!

182
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,854
Saruman!

183
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:41,232
Saruman!

184
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:47,280
I don't feel right going off
without Gandalf, Mr. Frodo.

185
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,324
I wish we could've waited, that I do.

186
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:52,619
So do I, Sam, but he said to leave
as soon as we could.

187
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:56,623
And Merry and Pippin insisted on coming
with us as far as Bree, for the fun of it.

188
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:20,647
There's someone coming up ahead,
Mr. Frodo. I can hear a horse.

189
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:24,192
Good. I'm tired of looking
at my cousins all day.

190
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:29,406
I think we should get off the road.
I don't want to be seen leaving the Shire.

191
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:34,494
- But it might be Gandalf.
- Then we'll surprise him. Hurry.

192
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:59,597
- We're going with you, Frodo.
- With me?

193
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:02,684
But how do you...? Sam.

194
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:07,438
- But you gave your word.
- They already knew so much, Mr. Frodo.

195
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:10,191
Sam didn't tell us about the Ring, Frodo.

196
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:13,111
I saw Bilbo use it once,
before he went away...

197
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:15,113
to hide from the Sackville-Bagginses.

198
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,824
And after that,
Pippin and I kept on the lookout...

199
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:20,493
and we followed you.
We asked questions everywhere.

200
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,454
And we even wormed
a few things out of Gandalf.

201
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,999
And you spied on me.
And Sam helped you.

202
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:30,628
- And we spied on you.
- But we meant no wrong to you, Mr. Frodo.

203
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:32,881
Don't you remember
what Mr. Gandalf said?

204
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:35,008
"Take someone that you can trust,"
he said.

205
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:39,095
- It doesn't seem that I can trust anyone.
- It all depends on what you want.

206
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:43,558
You can trust us to stick to you
through thick and thin, to the bitter end.

207
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:46,311
But you cannot trust us
to let you face trouble alone...

208
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:49,606
and go off without a word.
We're your friends, Frodo.

209
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:01,701
Heh. Bless you, you deceitful scoundrels.

210
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,666
Will we be stopping
at Bree tonight, Mr. Frodo?

211
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,168
I think so, Sam.

212
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:14,672
Well, we all need a fireside and a bath,
and a proper night's sleep in a real bed.

213
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,674
Oh, I do wish Gandalf were with us.

214
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:19,344
Maybe he'll be at the inn
when we get there.

215
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,845
Maybe.

216
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:17,068
I think I'll go out for a sniff of air.

217
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:22,073
Mind yourselves. Don't forget,
you're supposed to be escaping in secret.

218
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,287
- Oh, mind yourself. Don't get lost.
- Be careful, Merry.

219
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:32,500
Quiet. Quiet, all.

220
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:36,754
We have some visitors with us tonight,
all the way from the Shire.

221
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:40,300
They came all the way from the Shire.

222
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:44,846
- What was your name again, sir?
- Mr. Underhill.

223
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:47,974
Ha, Mr. Underhill and his party.

224
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:49,767
A song!

225
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:51,561
A song from the Shire!

226
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:54,939
The Shire!

227
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:59,569
Yes, Mr. Underhill, sing us a Shire song.

228
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:03,489
Well, a short one, then.

229
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:38,465
Who's there?

230
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:41,027
Who's there?

231
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:54,791
Look at him.

232
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,835
How little!

233
00:22:58,378 --> 00:22:59,629
So small.

234
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:08,304
He's a cute one.

235
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,891
Look at him go.

236
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:20,191
- Where did he go?
- Where is he?

237
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,569
What's he done?

238
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:26,406
What's going on here?

239
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,491
Take your magic tricks back to the Shire.

240
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:31,536
What's this place coming to,
I'd like to know?

241
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,204
Take them back on out of here!

242
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,460
Well, Mr. Underhill...

243
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:44,465
frightening my customers and breaking
up my crocks with your acrobatics.

244
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:49,846
Very sorry. It was quite unintentional,
a most unfortunate accident.

245
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,243
Well, you have put your foot in it
this time.

246
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:16,247
- Who are you?
- I am called Strider.

247
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:20,251
- Everyone knows me here.
- Well, we don't.

248
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:23,880
You've been very careless so far,
Mr. Frodo Baggins.

249
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:26,632
My name is Mr. Underhill.

250
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:30,761
After your performance tonight,
it won't matter what you call yourself.

251
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:33,222
The Black Riders will know
who you are by morning.

252
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:35,641
They already know what you bear.

253
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,518
Who are you really?

254
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:42,106
I am Gandalf's friend.
He asked me to watch out for you.

255
00:24:42,273 --> 00:24:44,609
Gandalf? Have you seen him?
Where is he?

256
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:46,819
I do not know.

257
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:52,241
We were supposed to meet him here,
but I've had no word, no message.

258
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:54,994
It is the first time
that I've ever feared for him.

259
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:59,832
Then we will have to go on
by ourselves tomorrow.

260
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:01,209
To Rivendell?

261
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:05,129
You'd never get there. The Black Riders
are watching the road night and day.

262
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:08,799
They'll come on you in the wild,
in some dark place, where there's no help.

263
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:11,594
I know the wild country.

264
00:25:11,761 --> 00:25:15,640
I can take you to Rivendell
by paths that are seldom trodden.

265
00:25:16,224 --> 00:25:20,102
- Will you have me?
- With your leave, Mr. Frodo, I'd say no.

266
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:23,981
This Strider, he says be more careful.
I say, let's start with him.

267
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:26,150
How do we know he's from Gandalf?

268
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:30,321
More likely, he's a play-acting spy,
working for...

269
00:25:30,488 --> 00:25:33,574
- For them.
- I don't know, Sam.

270
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:35,493
I think one of the enemy's servants...

271
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:39,664
would, well, seem fairer and feel fouler,
if you understand.

272
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:44,627
While I look foul and feel fair, is that it?

273
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:47,880
- Well, no, I meant...
- Frodo. Frodo!

274
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:52,718
Frodo, I've seen them!
I've seen them, Frodo.

275
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:55,846
I've seen them. Black Riders.

276
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:58,933
- My man found him lying in the street.
- There were two of them.

277
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:03,187
They were hissing to each other.
I seemed to be drawn towards them.

278
00:26:03,354 --> 00:26:05,648
Well, you do need looking after,
all of you.

279
00:26:06,524 --> 00:26:09,694
There's been strange folk about for days.

280
00:26:10,695 --> 00:26:12,572
That ranger...

281
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:15,533
Strider, coming and going and...

282
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,577
Strider.

283
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:20,871
- They've come from Mordor.
- Save us!

284
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:25,126
They won't trouble you once I'm gone.
Strider came to offer me his help.

285
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,880
Well, you know
your own business, maybe...

286
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:34,552
but in your place, I wouldn't take up
with a ranger out of the wild.

287
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:36,596
They have no choice.

288
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:39,390
There is no one else for them
except a fat innkeeper...

289
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:43,477
who only remembers his name
because people shout it at him all day.

290
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:49,275
I'll do what I can to help, Mr. Baggins.
Mr. Underhill.

291
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:54,739
- I'm no hero, but I'll do what I can.
- Keep watch tonight, you and your folk.

292
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,913
There is a hill called Weathertop...

293
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,417
about halfway between here
and Rivendell.

294
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:10,963
We will make for it tomorrow.
So will Gandalf, if he can.

295
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:15,009
I still don't know if we can trust him,
Mr. Frodo.

296
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:18,721
I said you have no choice, Sam.

297
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:21,766
Because, if I wanted the Ring
for myself...

298
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:25,311
I could have it now.

299
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:35,946
My name is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

300
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:43,829
If by life or death I can save you, I will.

301
00:30:46,846 --> 00:30:49,557
How long will we be
in these marshes, Aragorn?

302
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:50,873
At least two days.

303
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:54,311
I'm being eaten alive.

304
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,773
What do these things live on
when they can't get Hobbit?

305
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:02,570
Easy there, Bill. Easy, slow.

306
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:34,518
That is Weathertop.

307
00:31:35,019 --> 00:31:38,814
We shall be there by nightfall, if we set
a good pace and don't stop for lunch.

308
00:31:38,981 --> 00:31:42,860
- This goes on longer, I'll become a wraith.
- Don't speak of such things.

309
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,912
Aragorn. Aragorn.

310
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,092
And Beren was a mortal man...

311
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:11,680
but Lúthien Tinúviel
was the daughter of a king of Elves.

312
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:16,518
She was the fairest maiden that has ever
been among all the children of this world.

313
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:20,105
Yet she chose to be mortal, for him.

314
00:32:20,314 --> 00:32:23,609
And when he died, she followed him.

315
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:26,153
And so he was her doom...

316
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,114
but he was her love, as well.

317
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:32,952
- I thought I saw something.
- Hmm?

318
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:38,082
Maybe just shadows
in the moonlight, I don't know.

319
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:45,130
Stand close to the fire. Make a circle.

320
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:51,845
- What's that?
- Shh!

321
00:33:38,726 --> 00:33:40,019
No!

322
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:26,398
The Ring, Frodo! Take off the Ring.

323
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:08,857
Cold. It's so cold.

324
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:13,445
- Like a poisoned icicle.
- It is the cold of their world, Frodo.

325
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:16,740
When you put on the Ring,
you entered the world of the Black Riders.

326
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:19,660
Gandalf said not to.

327
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:23,330
Why is it so misty here?
I can't see very well.

328
00:35:23,497 --> 00:35:26,959
What's the matter with him?
It was only a little wound.

329
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:30,587
It was an evil knife that struck him, Sam.

330
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:34,883
I think that a piece broke off in the wound
and is working inward.

331
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:37,594
If it reaches his heart...

332
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:40,305
Couldn't you do anything?

333
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:44,143
We must get to Rivendell very soon.

334
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:49,565
He can't go no further.

335
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:52,234
He must. Do you want them to take him?

336
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:55,070
Wait, listen.

337
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:12,754
Ah! Legolas.

338
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:28,520
Yes, Sam, that's an elf.

339
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:37,529
So there has been
no word of Gandalf in Rivendell?

340
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:39,781
- No message at all?
- None.

341
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,660
My lord Elrond has sent every rider
he could spare to seek for you...

342
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:47,414
knowing that you bore a great burden
without guidance.

343
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:49,791
I have been on the road for nine days.

344
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:53,837
Well, Mr. Frodo has been on the road
a lot longer than that.

345
00:36:54,004 --> 00:36:56,131
And he's sick and he needs a rest.

346
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:59,635
Just for a while.

347
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:01,637
Sam...

348
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:04,890
no resting can help
your Mr. Frodo now.

349
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:08,477
Only the hands of Elrond in Rivendell
can do that.

350
00:37:08,644 --> 00:37:11,563
There are five Black Riders
close behind us...

351
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,942
and we may well find
the other four waiting at the ford.

352
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:19,321
If we lose even a little time,
we lose, Frodo, the Ring...

353
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,031
and Middle-earth.

354
00:37:22,241 --> 00:37:24,368
Do you understand me, Sam?

355
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:37,839
There is the ford of Rivendell.

356
00:37:58,527 --> 00:38:01,154
Fly, fly. The enemy is upon us.

357
00:38:56,043 --> 00:38:59,963
Come back. To Mordor we will take you.

358
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:39,336
Gandalf!

359
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:11,368
Back, come back.
To Mordor we'll take you.

360
00:40:11,535 --> 00:40:13,745
Come back, come back.

361
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:17,040
To Mordor we'll take you.

362
00:40:25,382 --> 00:40:27,342
Go back!

363
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:39,020
<i>Run, you fool, run!</i>

364
00:42:01,645 --> 00:42:06,024
The Ring, the Ring.

365
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:10,320
Go back to the land of Mordor,
and follow me no more.

366
00:42:10,487 --> 00:42:14,199
Come back. Come back.

367
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:16,910
To Mordor we will take you.

368
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:21,706
Come back. Come back.

369
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:24,668
Go back!

370
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:27,837
The Ring.

371
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:30,048
The Ring.

372
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:38,306
By all the Shire,
you shall have neither the Ring, nor me.

373
00:43:58,303 --> 00:44:02,724
No. No, never. Verily, I come.

374
00:44:02,891 --> 00:44:04,726
I give it unto you.

375
00:44:04,893 --> 00:44:08,855
- No, never. Gandalf!
- Yes.

376
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:12,942
I am here,
and you are lucky to be here, too...

377
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:16,196
after all the absurd things you've done
since you've left home.

378
00:44:16,363 --> 00:44:18,657
Where's Sam?
And are the others all right?

379
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:21,201
They've hardly left your side
for three days.

380
00:44:21,368 --> 00:44:22,535
Three days?

381
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:26,247
What happened at the ford?
It all seems so dim, somehow.

382
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:30,460
You were beginning to fade,
my remarkable friend.

383
00:44:30,627 --> 00:44:33,838
The knifepoint had almost
worked its way to your heart.

384
00:44:34,464 --> 00:44:37,467
Oh, I didn't know. Would I have...

385
00:44:37,634 --> 00:44:40,637
You would have become like them...

386
00:44:40,804 --> 00:44:43,431
one of the Ringwraiths...

387
00:44:45,225 --> 00:44:47,727
the servants of the Dark Lord...

388
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:50,355
if you had not resisted to the last.

389
00:44:50,522 --> 00:44:52,816
The river, it rose up against them.

390
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:54,401
It is Elrond's river.

391
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:58,363
This is his house,
and it was Elrond himself who healed you.

392
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:02,867
If I may say so,
I added a few touches of my own.

393
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:06,371
The white horses and so on.
If you noticed.

394
00:45:06,538 --> 00:45:12,460
- Then that is the end of the Black Riders?
- Not so long as the Ring itself exists.

395
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:16,673
They will fly back to their master in Mordor,
empty and crippled...

396
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:21,511
until they find new shapes to wear
and new beasts to ride.

397
00:45:21,678 --> 00:45:24,889
We have beaten them,
just for a while, Frodo.

398
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:29,561
- That's sort of a relief.
- I wish that were the truth, Frodo.

399
00:45:29,728 --> 00:45:33,148
I'm afraid we have a new
and closer problem at hand.

400
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:36,359
You have not asked me why
I was late getting back to the Shire.

401
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:38,945
I forgot.

402
00:45:39,112 --> 00:45:42,782
When I was certain that yours was indeed
the Master Ring...

403
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:45,827
<i>I rode at once to Isengard.</i>

404
00:45:45,994 --> 00:45:47,454
<i>And I thought...</i>

405
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:51,124
<i>that if anyone could know
what was best to do with the One Ring...</i>

406
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:55,170
<i>it would surely be Saruman the White.</i>

407
00:45:58,339 --> 00:46:00,258
<i>The great eagle, Gwaihir...</i>

408
00:46:00,425 --> 00:46:04,220
<i>came in answer to my call,
and bore me away.</i>

409
00:46:05,972 --> 00:46:10,435
<i>Saruman's never paid
enough attention to animals.</i>

410
00:46:10,602 --> 00:46:13,271
- But if he should seize the Ring...
- He will make himself...

411
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:16,107
the master of all Middle-earth.

412
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:21,529
The War of the Ring has begun, Frodo.

413
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:27,327
You will hear the rest in Council
when you are well enough. Rest now.

414
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,296
<i>The leaves were long
The grass was green</i>

415
00:46:38,922 --> 00:46:43,134
<i>With the hemlock umbels, tall and fair</i>

416
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:53,603
<i>And in the glade a light was seen
Of stars in shadow, shimmering</i>

417
00:46:54,479 --> 00:46:57,148
<i>Tinúviel was dancing there</i>

418
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:58,817
Bilbo!

419
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:06,825
Hello, Frodo, my lad.

420
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:09,828
Where have you been?
Why haven't I seen you before?

421
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:14,833
Heh. Well, I've seen a good deal of you,
sitting by your side with Sam each day.

422
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:18,503
Bilbo, have you been here all the time?
All these years?

423
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:23,633
Well, there didn't seem much reason
to be anywhere else, after all.

424
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:29,681
The food's very good.
And I listen, and I think.

425
00:47:29,848 --> 00:47:33,935
- A remarkable place altogether.
- Ha, yes.

426
00:47:36,479 --> 00:47:39,941
And now, of course, there's all this bustle
about that ring of mine.

427
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:44,696
Fancy the little thing causing
such a disturbance. Have you got it here?

428
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:47,740
Yes, I have.

429
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:51,744
I should very much like
just to peep at it again, just for a moment.

430
00:48:11,014 --> 00:48:12,724
Put it away.

431
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:17,228
I understand now.

432
00:48:18,897 --> 00:48:20,732
I'm sorry.

433
00:48:21,649 --> 00:48:24,027
Sorry about...

434
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:26,321
everything.

435
00:48:27,989 --> 00:48:29,365
Don't...

436
00:48:30,033 --> 00:48:32,076
adventures...

437
00:48:32,327 --> 00:48:35,163
ever have an end?

438
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:42,045
The Council of Elrond is beginning.

439
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:45,048
Come with me. Both of you.

440
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:55,266
<i>All that morning, the Council of
Elrond debated the history of the One Ring...</i>

441
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:57,435
<i>and its master, Sauron.</i>

442
00:48:57,602 --> 00:49:00,939
<i>Gandalf also told all present
of Saruman, the traitor...</i>

443
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:03,566
<i>and his desire
for the power of the Ring.</i>

444
00:49:03,733 --> 00:49:06,861
<i>Elves and Dwarves, in their turn,
told what they knew of Sauron's...</i>

445
00:49:07,028 --> 00:49:11,783
<i>preparations for conquest,
and so did Boromir of Gondor.</i>

446
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:15,411
In Gondor, we are already under attack
by the forces of Mordor.

447
00:49:15,954 --> 00:49:18,289
I am Boromir. In a dream...

448
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:24,462
I heard a voice crying to me, saying:
"Seek for the sword that was broken."

449
00:49:24,629 --> 00:49:26,881
Here is the sword of Elendil of Gondor...

450
00:49:27,048 --> 00:49:29,926
who fought the Dark Lord long ago
and was slain.

451
00:49:30,093 --> 00:49:31,970
<i>So Frodo learned at last...</i>

452
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:35,598
<i>the true heritage of Aragorn,
the son of Arathorn...</i>

453
00:49:35,765 --> 00:49:40,436
<i>descendent of Isildur,
who cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand.</i>

454
00:49:40,603 --> 00:49:44,899
Then it belongs to you,
and not to me at all?

455
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:48,361
Bring out the Ring, Frodo.

456
00:49:48,528 --> 00:49:50,780
The time has come.

457
00:49:52,824 --> 00:49:54,701
Isildur's Bane.

458
00:49:54,867 --> 00:49:56,494
The Halfling.

459
00:49:56,661 --> 00:50:00,248
What shall we do with it then,
this mightiest of all weapons?

460
00:50:00,415 --> 00:50:03,835
We cannot keep it, we cannot destroy it.

461
00:50:04,002 --> 00:50:07,130
Sauron, who forged it,
looks for his Ring...

462
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:10,758
and Saruman, who envies it,
searches for its power too.

463
00:50:12,969 --> 00:50:16,222
I see no other road for us
but the most fearful.

464
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:18,099
The road into Mordor.

465
00:50:18,558 --> 00:50:21,853
We must send the Ring to the fire
where it was made.

466
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:23,187
To Mount Doom.

467
00:50:24,564 --> 00:50:28,026
What foolishness is this? Why do
you speak of hiding and destroying?

468
00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:32,238
- The Ring could save all Middle-earth.
- Have you heard nothing?

469
00:50:32,405 --> 00:50:36,242
It is Sauron's Ring. To wield it...

470
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:40,997
you would have to become Sauron.
I will not touch it.

471
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:43,523
Nor I.

472
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:48,421
Our one hope lies in foolishness, Boromir.

473
00:50:48,588 --> 00:50:52,592
The Dark Lord cannot conceive
of anyone wishing to destroy his Ring.

474
00:50:52,759 --> 00:50:56,971
He will wait
until one of us tries to use it...

475
00:50:57,138 --> 00:51:00,058
follow every move we make.

476
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:04,228
And it is just possible
that he may not notice...

477
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:09,233
the small, quiet feet
walking into peril...

478
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,235
into Mordor.

479
00:51:13,613 --> 00:51:17,909
Very well. Very well. It's plain enough
what you're pointing at.

480
00:51:18,076 --> 00:51:23,247
Bilbo, the silly Hobbit, started this affair,
and Bilbo had better finish it, or himself.

481
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:25,666
When ought I to start?

482
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:28,920
It has passed beyond you, Bilbo.

483
00:51:29,087 --> 00:51:32,840
This last journey
must be for others to make.

484
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:39,430
- Ah, and who are they to be?
- That is what they're trying to decide here.

485
00:51:42,058 --> 00:51:43,434
I...

486
00:51:44,102 --> 00:51:46,062
I will take the Ring...

487
00:51:46,229 --> 00:51:48,731
though I do not know the way.

488
00:51:49,232 --> 00:51:52,276
I think that this task
is appointed for you, Frodo.

489
00:51:53,528 --> 00:51:56,572
This is the hour of the Shire-folk, at last.

490
00:51:57,281 --> 00:51:59,700
But you won't
send him off alone, surely?

491
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:05,540
You, at least, shall go with him,
Master Samwise.

492
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:07,708
It is hardly possible to separate you...

493
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:11,796
even when he is summoned
to a secret Council, and you are not.

494
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:18,678
A nice pickle we've landed ourselves in,
Mr. Frodo.

495
00:52:21,931 --> 00:52:25,685
I thought perhaps
you might care to have these.

496
00:52:25,852 --> 00:52:30,231
Bilbo, I don't think I should look right.

497
00:52:30,398 --> 00:52:33,734
You can wear the shirt
under your clothes.

498
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:36,195
It's as light as anything.

499
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:41,325
But I fancy it might turn
even the knives of the Black Riders.

500
00:52:46,831 --> 00:52:51,210
I named the sword Sting, long ago.

501
00:52:51,377 --> 00:52:54,088
It's silly, but there you are.

502
00:52:54,797 --> 00:52:57,842
It shines when there are enemies about.

503
00:52:58,843 --> 00:53:01,179
Orcs and things.

504
00:53:02,722 --> 00:53:04,265
There.

505
00:53:04,724 --> 00:53:09,020
Now, you look just a plain Hobbit
on the surface, but...

506
00:53:11,189 --> 00:53:12,523
Well...

507
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:14,775
take care.

508
00:53:15,818 --> 00:53:19,655
Bring back any old songs
and tales you hear.

509
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,465
<i>Our only hope is in speed and secrecy.</i>

510
00:53:37,632 --> 00:53:39,717
<i>The company of the Ring shall be nine.</i>

511
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:43,221
<i>Nine walkers against
the nine Riders of Mordor.</i>

512
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:49,143
<i>With Sam and Frodo, Gandalf will go.</i>

513
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:51,103
<i>For the other free peoples...</i>

514
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:57,485
<i>Legolas shall be for the Elves,
and Gimli, son of Glóin, for the Dwarves.</i>

515
00:53:58,194 --> 00:54:01,906
<i>For Men shall go
the valiant Boromir of Gondor...</i>

516
00:54:02,073 --> 00:54:05,243
<i>and Aragorn, son of Arathorn.</i>

517
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:08,412
<i>And for the last two places,
we will trust to friendship...</i>

518
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:10,456
<i>rather than to great wisdom.</i>

519
00:54:10,623 --> 00:54:15,419
<i>Peregrin Took and Meriadoc Brandybuck
may also go.</i>

520
00:54:21,259 --> 00:54:25,554
When did you ever know such a storm
so far south?

521
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:29,016
The Dark Lord's arm has grown long
if he can hurl snow at us...

522
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:31,018
all the way from Mordor.

523
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:35,606
His arm has grown long.

524
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:49,495
There is only one course for us.

525
00:54:49,662 --> 00:54:52,415
No, Gandalf, not that dark way, I beg you.

526
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:54,208
And what would you suggest?

527
00:54:54,375 --> 00:54:58,462
Returning to Rivendell to wait there
for the end? We have no choice, Aragorn.

528
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:00,631
We might go by way
of the Gap of Rohan.

529
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:05,594
That would take the Ring too close to
Isengard and Aruman. We dare not risk it.

530
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:07,763
Yet you would risk the Mines of Moria.

531
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:12,601
Where both you and I have walked before
and come out again alive.

532
00:55:12,768 --> 00:55:15,062
The memory is very evil.

533
00:55:15,563 --> 00:55:18,316
I do not wish to enter Moria
a second time.

534
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:20,651
And I don't wish to enter it even once.

535
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:22,069
Nor me.

536
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:26,657
The question is not who wishes to go,
but who will?

537
00:55:26,824 --> 00:55:30,494
There is no other way
to pass the mountains.

538
00:55:32,747 --> 00:55:34,999
I will go with you.

539
00:55:35,166 --> 00:55:39,503
My cousin Balin led a company
of Dwarves there, many years ago.

540
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:42,923
There has been no word of them
in all that time.

541
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:45,926
Elves do not walk in the dark earth.

542
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:48,971
I will go, but I fear for you, Gandalf.

543
00:55:49,138 --> 00:55:53,476
I will not go, not unless the vote
of the whole company is against me.

544
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:59,023
What does the Ring-bearer say?

545
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:00,858
I do not wish to go.

546
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:09,033
But I will go, if Gandalf advises it.

547
00:56:23,255 --> 00:56:27,676
Steady. Easy, Bill. Old Gandalf
will have that gate open in a minute.

548
00:56:27,843 --> 00:56:29,095
What if he can't?

549
00:56:29,261 --> 00:56:32,556
I have never seen anything
Mr. Gandalf couldn't do.

550
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:33,873
Sam!

551
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:37,895
Fireworks are all very nice,
but this is elf magic.

552
00:56:48,197 --> 00:56:51,325
What a people you Dwarves are
for hiding things.

553
00:56:51,492 --> 00:56:54,703
On the gates of your most wondrous,
ancient kingdom you write:

554
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:59,917
"Speak, friend, and enter," and no spell
in any language can open the door.

555
00:57:04,505 --> 00:57:07,425
Why do you keep looking
at the lake, Frodo?

556
00:57:08,843 --> 00:57:10,719
I'm afraid of it.

557
00:57:14,098 --> 00:57:16,976
And there sits our quest.
If we had to bring a wizard at all...

558
00:57:17,143 --> 00:57:19,728
- it should have been Aruman.
- Be still, Boromir.

559
00:57:19,895 --> 00:57:22,940
Why? There are other ways to turn
if our Wizard's balked.

560
00:57:23,107 --> 00:57:24,942
I said, from the beginning...

561
00:57:28,154 --> 00:57:31,866
Gandalf, you old fool.

562
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:56,640
So all you had to do
was say, "friend," and enter.

563
00:57:56,807 --> 00:58:00,227
Those were happier times.

564
00:58:01,145 --> 00:58:02,295
Let us go.

565
00:58:13,282 --> 00:58:14,432
Gandalf!

566
00:58:23,292 --> 00:58:25,753
I'm coming, Mr. Frodo, I'm coming!

567
00:58:39,725 --> 00:58:41,310
Into the gateway. All of you!

568
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:47,024
Bill!

569
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:53,364
Poor old Bill. Poor old Bill.

570
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:00,454
Gandalf...

571
00:59:00,955 --> 00:59:05,209
- what was the thing in the water?
- I do not know.

572
00:59:05,668 --> 00:59:10,005
There are older and fouler things than Orcs
in the deep places of the world.

573
00:59:10,172 --> 00:59:12,841
Whatever it was, it grabbed
Frodo first, out of all of us.

574
00:59:13,008 --> 00:59:14,635
Be quiet, Pippin!

575
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:25,104
We have gone far enough for today.

576
00:59:25,563 --> 00:59:28,148
Let us stop here for the night.

577
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:11,025
Seems to have been a guardroom.

578
01:00:11,191 --> 01:00:13,777
Yes, there's even a well.

579
01:00:14,903 --> 01:00:18,449
We had better rest here.

580
01:00:21,493 --> 01:00:23,454
It's hard to believe that even Dwarves...

581
01:00:23,621 --> 01:00:26,624
could have lived
in this half-drowned dungeon.

582
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:31,253
- It was a great realm once.
- Be still. Both of you.

583
01:00:34,506 --> 01:00:37,301
Which way do we take tomorrow, Gandalf?

584
01:00:37,468 --> 01:00:39,303
I have not decided.

585
01:00:39,470 --> 01:00:44,933
The path to the left smells foul,
and I am too weary to choose.

586
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:49,313
The way ahead feels wrong, somehow.

587
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:54,652
At least the middle way goes
up. It's time we began to climb again.

588
01:00:55,152 --> 01:00:59,907
Perhaps. I cannot remember.

589
01:01:01,909 --> 01:01:03,410
What's that?

590
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:09,249
- Pippin!
- Oh, um...

591
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:12,169
Just a stone. I, uh, dropped a stone.

592
01:01:12,336 --> 01:01:17,007
Fool of a Took.
Throw yourself in next time. Be quiet.

593
01:01:17,675 --> 01:01:19,093
Fool of a Pippin!

594
01:01:42,116 --> 01:01:43,867
Yes, this way.

595
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:46,745
We should find our way down
to the Great Gates by tonight.

596
01:01:46,912 --> 01:01:48,872
I shall be glad.

597
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:51,959
I doubt now that Dwarves
ever came back here.

598
01:01:52,126 --> 01:01:55,170
Why should they have come back?
What was left for them to mine?

599
01:01:55,587 --> 01:02:01,218
Mithril silver.
The most precious metal in the world.

600
01:02:23,198 --> 01:02:26,660
"Balin, son of Fundin...

601
01:02:26,827 --> 01:02:29,455
Lord of Moria."

602
01:02:29,621 --> 01:02:32,583
They did come back.

603
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:37,838
It seems to be a record of the colony.

604
01:02:38,589 --> 01:02:42,760
Orc swords.
There was a great battle here.

605
01:02:42,926 --> 01:02:44,470
Yes.

606
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:48,599
"Balin is now Lord of Moria."

607
01:02:49,141 --> 01:02:53,437
Here it says, "We found Mithril."

608
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:55,814
Now it says:

609
01:02:56,899 --> 01:03:01,695
"Yesterday, Balin, Lord of Moria, fell.

610
01:03:01,862 --> 01:03:05,282
An Orc shot him from behind a stone.

611
01:03:07,618 --> 01:03:10,621
We slew the Orc, but many more..."

612
01:03:10,788 --> 01:03:13,832
Then it says,
"We have barred the gates."

613
01:03:13,999 --> 01:03:19,171
And something about,
"The Watcher in the Water."

614
01:03:24,092 --> 01:03:27,387
- What do you hear?
- Nothing.

615
01:03:27,805 --> 01:03:31,016
- But I feel.
- It is grim reading.

616
01:03:31,183 --> 01:03:34,645
"They have taken the bridge.
They are coming.

617
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:41,193
We cannot get out.
Drums, drums in the deep."

618
01:03:42,611 --> 01:03:48,659
- There is nothing more.
- Gandalf? I don't wanna stay here.

619
01:03:53,121 --> 01:03:57,835
We are going now, Pippin.
There is nothing more.

620
01:04:02,881 --> 01:04:06,844
- They're coming.
- Slam the doors and wedge them.

621
01:04:11,265 --> 01:04:14,852
Keep the east door ajar.
We must not get shut in.

622
01:04:27,531 --> 01:04:31,451
Orcs and something else.
A great cave-troll, I think.

623
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:33,453
Out this way.

624
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:44,548
The Shire!

625
01:04:48,594 --> 01:04:50,470
For the Shire!

626
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:08,655
Now is the last chance. Run for it!

627
01:05:46,485 --> 01:05:48,654
I'm all right. I can walk.

628
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:51,490
I thought you were dead.

629
01:05:54,993 --> 01:05:57,454
All of you, down the stairs!

630
01:06:15,097 --> 01:06:17,391
Lead the way, Gimli.
Pippin and Merry next.

631
01:06:18,141 --> 01:06:22,229
Come no closer.
Come no closer, I warn you!

632
01:06:58,890 --> 01:07:01,351
Balrog.

633
01:07:09,192 --> 01:07:14,281
Fly, all of you.
Fly, up the stair and straight on.

634
01:07:14,448 --> 01:07:17,534
Fly. You cannot help me.

635
01:07:20,203 --> 01:07:21,371
You cannot pass.

636
01:07:29,129 --> 01:07:32,424
I am a servant of the Secret Fire.

637
01:07:32,591 --> 01:07:36,887
You cannot pass.
Go back to the shadow.

638
01:07:48,065 --> 01:07:51,026
You cannot pass!

639
01:08:15,092 --> 01:08:16,426
Fly, you fools!

640
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:36,947
Come. Follow me.

641
01:08:37,114 --> 01:08:39,032
Obey him.

642
01:08:58,802 --> 01:09:00,595
There may be a bit of a scar, Sam.

643
01:09:00,762 --> 01:09:01,930
I don't care.

644
01:09:02,097 --> 01:09:03,598
Now it is your turn, Frodo.

645
01:09:03,765 --> 01:09:06,101
I'm all right. What does it matter now?

646
01:09:06,268 --> 01:09:08,979
It matters. We still have a long road,
and much to do.

647
01:09:09,146 --> 01:09:12,107
Why? We've no hope without Gandalf.
You know that, Aragorn.

648
01:09:12,274 --> 01:09:16,778
Then we must do without hope.
There is always vengeance.

649
01:09:18,989 --> 01:09:20,490
Mithril shirt!

650
01:09:21,408 --> 01:09:23,326
That's what saved you.

651
01:09:23,493 --> 01:09:25,954
I have never seen one so beautiful.

652
01:09:26,121 --> 01:09:27,372
- There.
- What is it?

653
01:09:27,539 --> 01:09:29,749
The footsteps,
I heard them in Moria, following.

654
01:09:29,916 --> 01:09:31,835
The Orcs will not come until dark.

655
01:09:32,002 --> 01:09:33,336
It never sounds like an Orc.

656
01:09:33,503 --> 01:09:35,463
They're bare feet and they flap.

657
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:39,009
Whatever creature it is,
it won't follow us where we're going.

658
01:09:39,176 --> 01:09:41,094
Nothing evil passes through Lothlórien.

659
01:09:41,261 --> 01:09:45,015
- That is not what we say in Gondor.
- Then you know nothing in Gondor.

660
01:09:45,182 --> 01:09:49,394
Out of Moria into the Golden Wood.
Is there no way less perilous?

661
01:09:49,561 --> 01:09:53,231
I would almost rather face
the Balrog again, than... Than the Lady.

662
01:09:53,857 --> 01:09:58,069
Lothlórien is a place of healing.
There is no evil in it, unless a man...

663
01:09:58,236 --> 01:10:02,365
- brings evil there with him.
- Welcome to Lothlórien.

664
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:06,203
I am Galadriel,
and this is my lord, Celeborn.

665
01:10:07,829 --> 01:10:11,082
The forests have told us of your loss.

666
01:10:11,249 --> 01:10:14,294
We sorrow for you,
and for all of Middle-earth.

667
01:10:14,461 --> 01:10:18,340
Rest here now for a little,
until you are healed.

668
01:10:18,506 --> 01:10:21,009
Your quest is known to us.

669
01:10:21,176 --> 01:10:23,303
We will do what we can to aid you.

670
01:10:24,054 --> 01:10:27,390
Frodo Baggins of the Shire?

671
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:04,594
It's a song about Gandalf, isn't it?

672
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:08,556
Yes, Mithrandir
was the Elves' name for him.

673
01:11:08,723 --> 01:11:10,600
It means, "gray pilgrim."

674
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:15,021
We knew so little of him in the Shire,
Aragorn. He was just Gandalf, to us.

675
01:11:15,188 --> 01:11:20,485
- We never knew he had so many names.
- I think he was fondest of Gandalf.

676
01:12:00,984 --> 01:12:04,321
This is the mirror of Galadriel.

677
01:12:04,487 --> 01:12:07,991
It shows things that were,
and things that are...

678
01:12:08,158 --> 01:12:10,869
and things that yet may be.

679
01:12:11,036 --> 01:12:13,163
Do you wish to look?

680
01:12:14,497 --> 01:12:17,000
I'd not mind a glimpse
of what's going on at home.

681
01:12:17,167 --> 01:12:19,210
It seems a terrible long time
I've been away.

682
01:12:19,377 --> 01:12:22,339
Come then, you shall look...

683
01:12:22,505 --> 01:12:24,632
and see what you may.

684
01:12:27,719 --> 01:12:30,138
I gotta go home.
They've dug up Bagshot Row...

685
01:12:30,305 --> 01:12:32,640
and thrown my poor old Gaffer
out in the street.

686
01:12:32,807 --> 01:12:33,957
I've gotta go home.

687
01:12:34,059 --> 01:12:39,022
The mirror shows many things, Sam,
and not all have yet come to pass.

688
01:12:39,189 --> 01:12:43,193
Some never come to be,
unless those that behold the visions...

689
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:46,112
turn aside from their path
to prevent them.

690
01:12:49,574 --> 01:12:53,703
Do you wish to leave Frodo now,
and go home?

691
01:12:54,204 --> 01:12:56,039
No.

692
01:13:03,254 --> 01:13:04,839
Gandalf?

693
01:13:05,382 --> 01:13:06,633
No.

694
01:13:06,966 --> 01:13:09,177
No, it must be Aruman.

695
01:13:24,067 --> 01:13:26,486
Do not touch the water.

696
01:13:27,195 --> 01:13:28,655
He is looking for you.

697
01:13:29,239 --> 01:13:34,953
But he cannot find you, not here, not yet.
The door is closed.

698
01:13:37,038 --> 01:13:40,667
"Three Rings for the Elven-kings
under the sky."

699
01:13:40,834 --> 01:13:42,335
Yes.

700
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:46,589
We hid those three from him,
and he has never touched them.

701
01:13:46,756 --> 01:13:52,262
If your quest fails, then nothing can stand
against him and we are defenseless.

702
01:13:53,138 --> 01:13:57,267
Yet, if you succeed,
if the One Ring is destroyed...

703
01:13:57,434 --> 01:14:00,270
all we built with the three will fade.

704
01:14:00,437 --> 01:14:05,066
Time will come here,
and Lothlórien will fade.

705
01:14:05,233 --> 01:14:08,528
You are the footstep
of doom to us, Frodo.

706
01:14:08,695 --> 01:14:13,241
Lady Galadriel, I will give you
the One Ring, if you ask for it.

707
01:14:14,534 --> 01:14:16,035
It's too great a matter for me.

708
01:14:21,166 --> 01:14:23,877
And I came to test your heart.

709
01:14:25,462 --> 01:14:29,132
You will give me the Great Ring freely...

710
01:14:29,299 --> 01:14:33,636
and in place of the Dark Lord
you will set up a queen.

711
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:36,639
And I shall not be evil, but beautiful...

712
01:14:36,806 --> 01:14:40,351
and terrible as the morning
and the night.

713
01:14:40,518 --> 01:14:43,438
Stronger than the foundations
of the earth.

714
01:14:43,605 --> 01:14:47,901
All shall love me and despair.

715
01:14:50,987 --> 01:14:53,823
I passed the test.

716
01:14:54,199 --> 01:14:59,913
I will diminish and go into the west,
and remain Galadriel.

717
01:15:00,413 --> 01:15:03,833
And you must depart in the morning.

718
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:14,552
For Gondor and the House of Isildur.

719
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:18,515
For Gondor and the city of Minas Tirith.

720
01:15:23,978 --> 01:15:26,564
In a few days, we will have to choose.

721
01:15:26,731 --> 01:15:29,859
Shall we turn west with Boromir
and go to the wars of Gondor...

722
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:32,987
or turn east to Mordor
and its Dark Lord?

723
01:15:33,154 --> 01:15:37,408
- Or shall we break our fellowship?
- I'm going with Mr. Frodo.

724
01:15:37,575 --> 01:15:39,494
I know that, Sam.

725
01:15:42,914 --> 01:15:47,377
What a place. What an horrible place.

726
01:15:51,589 --> 01:15:56,886
Behold the Argonath,
the pillars of the kings.

727
01:15:57,053 --> 01:16:01,182
They are Isildur and Anárion,
my fathers of old.

728
01:16:02,183 --> 01:16:05,270
If Gandalf were here...

729
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:21,619
The day has come at last, the day
of choice, which we have long delayed.

730
01:16:21,953 --> 01:16:24,664
What shall now become of our company?

731
01:16:25,582 --> 01:16:28,376
I am not Gandalf.

732
01:16:28,793 --> 01:16:32,213
I have tried to guide you
as he would've done, but...

733
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:35,967
if he had any plan for this moment,
he never told me.

734
01:16:36,134 --> 01:16:37,969
Even if he had...

735
01:16:38,136 --> 01:16:41,264
If he had lived...

736
01:16:41,431 --> 01:16:44,934
I think the burden
would still have fallen on you, Frodo.

737
01:16:45,101 --> 01:16:48,104
You alone can choose your way now.

738
01:16:48,855 --> 01:16:51,274
The burden is heavy.

739
01:16:51,608 --> 01:16:53,943
Give me an hour longer, and I will speak.

740
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:56,070
Let me be alone!

741
01:16:57,030 --> 01:16:58,906
You shall have your hour.

742
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:01,451
And you shall be alone.

743
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:09,042
Who's there?

744
01:17:11,002 --> 01:17:15,006
- Boromir.
- I was afraid for you, Frodo.

745
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:18,635
The Orcs may be on this side
of the river by now.

746
01:17:18,801 --> 01:17:21,137
May I stay and talk to you,
just for a while?

747
01:17:21,304 --> 01:17:24,098
You're kind,
but there's nothing to be said.

748
01:17:24,265 --> 01:17:27,560
I know what I should do,
but I'm afraid of doing it, Boromir.

749
01:17:27,727 --> 01:17:30,480
I wish I could help you.
Will you hear my counsel?

750
01:17:30,647 --> 01:17:33,149
I know what your advice
would be, Boromir.

751
01:17:33,316 --> 01:17:36,444
To go with you to Gondor
and use the Ring to defend Minas Tirith.

752
01:17:36,611 --> 01:17:39,155
And is that such ill counsel?

753
01:17:39,322 --> 01:17:42,325
Why should we fear to use the Ring
in a just cause?

754
01:17:42,492 --> 01:17:45,995
Boromir, whatever is done with the Ring
turns to evil.

755
01:17:46,162 --> 01:17:49,165
Gandalf and Elrond refused to touch it,
and Galadriel herself...

756
01:17:49,332 --> 01:17:51,876
Yes, yes, I know all that.

757
01:17:52,043 --> 01:17:55,505
For themselves, they may be right,
these Elves and half-Elves and Wizards!

758
01:17:55,672 --> 01:18:00,593
But truehearted men will not be corrupted.
We, of Minas Tirith, do not seek power.

759
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:05,515
Only the strength to defend ourselves.
Where is the evil in that, Frodo?

760
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,310
You cannot answer, none of them can.

761
01:18:09,477 --> 01:18:12,188
It's madness not to use
the power of the enemy against him.

762
01:18:12,355 --> 01:18:14,899
Think what Aragorn could do
with the Ring in this hour.

763
01:18:15,066 --> 01:18:17,694
Or if he refuses, why not Boromir?

764
01:18:19,696 --> 01:18:21,948
How I would drive the hosts of Mordor...

765
01:18:22,115 --> 01:18:25,034
until I stood face-to-face
with Sauron himself.

766
01:18:25,201 --> 01:18:27,995
And they tell us to throw it away!

767
01:18:28,579 --> 01:18:30,707
Come with me, Frodo.

768
01:18:31,833 --> 01:18:33,418
My city is not far.

769
01:18:33,584 --> 01:18:36,129
You can go to Mordor from there,
if you must.

770
01:18:36,295 --> 01:18:39,006
Only, trust me, let me try my plan.

771
01:18:40,341 --> 01:18:44,053
- Lend me the Ring.
- No, Boromir.

772
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:45,370
No.

773
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:49,183
Fool. Obstinate fool.
It is only yours by chance.

774
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:50,977
It might have been mine.

775
01:18:51,144 --> 01:18:54,564
It should be mine. Give it to me!

776
01:18:57,442 --> 01:19:02,113
Miserable trickster.
You'll sell us all to Sauron.

777
01:19:02,864 --> 01:19:05,283
Traitor. Traitor!

778
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:09,912
Curse you to death and darkness,
all you Halflings!

779
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:15,585
What have I done?

780
01:19:17,879 --> 01:19:19,672
Frodo, come back!

781
01:19:19,964 --> 01:19:23,468
A madness took me, but it has passed.

782
01:19:23,634 --> 01:19:25,845
Come back!

783
01:19:35,938 --> 01:19:37,940
This waiting's horrible.

784
01:19:38,608 --> 01:19:41,903
Where have you been, Boromir?
Have you seen Frodo?

785
01:19:43,654 --> 01:19:47,408
I tried to convince him
to come to Minas Tirith.

786
01:19:47,909 --> 01:19:52,038
I... I grew angry and he vanished.

787
01:19:52,705 --> 01:19:55,291
Is that all you have to say?

788
01:19:55,792 --> 01:19:59,921
- He put the Ring on.
- But where did he go? Where is he?

789
01:20:00,087 --> 01:20:02,423
Mr. Frodo! Mr. Frodo!

790
01:20:03,132 --> 01:20:04,634
Gimli, Legolas, stop them.

791
01:20:07,637 --> 01:20:10,765
I don't know what part you've played
in this mischief, but help now!

792
01:20:10,932 --> 01:20:15,603
Go after Merry and Pippin and guard them,
even if you cannot find Frodo. Go on!

793
01:20:21,943 --> 01:20:24,487
Follow me, Sam. Stay close.

794
01:20:24,654 --> 01:20:26,489
Whoa, Sam Gamgee.

795
01:20:26,656 --> 01:20:28,991
Your legs are too short,
so use your head.

796
01:20:33,830 --> 01:20:35,998
The boats.

797
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:44,090
Coming, Mr. Frodo. Coming.

798
01:20:44,257 --> 01:20:46,843
It's only water, now.

799
01:20:53,891 --> 01:20:56,519
- I'm here, Sam.
- Save me, Mr. Frodo.

800
01:20:56,686 --> 01:20:59,021
- Help, I'm drowning.
- Take my hand.

801
01:20:59,188 --> 01:21:02,233
- Where's your hand?
- Here. Here it is.

802
01:21:06,362 --> 01:21:09,615
Of all the confounded nuisances
I ever knew.

803
01:21:09,782 --> 01:21:11,701
Oh, Mr. Frodo, that's hard.

804
01:21:11,868 --> 01:21:14,203
If I hadn't guessed right,
where would you be now?

805
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:16,455
Safely on my way.

806
01:21:17,164 --> 01:21:19,792
Safely? All alone
and without me to help you?

807
01:21:19,959 --> 01:21:23,004
But I am going to Mordor.

808
01:21:23,921 --> 01:21:26,924
Well, of course you are,
Mr. Frodo, and I'm coming with you.

809
01:21:32,972 --> 01:21:35,016
Oh, it's no good trying to escape you.

810
01:21:38,019 --> 01:21:39,729
I'm glad, Sam.

811
01:21:43,482 --> 01:21:45,735
May the others find a safe road.

812
01:21:45,902 --> 01:21:47,653
Aragorn will look after them.

813
01:21:50,072 --> 01:21:51,407
I don't...

814
01:21:51,908 --> 01:21:54,076
Don't suppose we shall see them again.

815
01:21:54,243 --> 01:21:58,748
Yet we may, Mr. Frodo. We may.

816
01:22:10,092 --> 01:22:12,303
- This way.
- Frodo!

817
01:22:12,470 --> 01:22:13,620
Frodo!

818
01:22:19,226 --> 01:22:20,937
Halfling.

819
01:24:04,415 --> 01:24:05,958
Boromir.

820
01:24:32,568 --> 01:24:34,111
Boromir.

821
01:24:36,072 --> 01:24:38,574
I tried to take the Ring from Frodo.

822
01:24:39,617 --> 01:24:41,327
I'm sorry.

823
01:24:41,494 --> 01:24:43,245
I have paid.

824
01:24:44,038 --> 01:24:45,456
Aragorn...

825
01:24:46,332 --> 01:24:49,585
Aragorn, go to Minas Tirith.

826
01:24:50,419 --> 01:24:52,588
Save my people.

827
01:24:54,090 --> 01:24:55,883
Aragorn...

828
01:24:57,384 --> 01:24:59,011
I will go.

829
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:00,620
I promise you.

830
01:25:02,098 --> 01:25:03,891
The Halflings.

831
01:25:04,225 --> 01:25:06,268
Orcs took them.

832
01:25:07,019 --> 01:25:10,106
I think they are not dead.

833
01:25:39,176 --> 01:25:43,639
Either we take the last boat and follow
Frodo, or we follow the Orcs on foot.

834
01:25:43,806 --> 01:25:47,268
Pippin and Merry may be dead by now.
We don't know.

835
01:25:48,811 --> 01:25:51,564
We cannot forsake them.

836
01:25:51,856 --> 01:25:55,442
The fate of the Ring-bearer
is in my hands no longer.

837
01:25:55,609 --> 01:25:57,862
The company of the Ring
has played its part.

838
01:25:58,988 --> 01:26:00,990
We follow the Orcs.

839
01:28:32,308 --> 01:28:34,977
Filth. Maggots.

840
01:28:35,144 --> 01:28:37,229
Can't run.

841
01:29:17,019 --> 01:29:18,771
Hello, Pippin.

842
01:29:18,937 --> 01:29:21,899
So you've come
on this little expedition too?

843
01:29:23,359 --> 01:29:25,027
When do we get bed and breakfast?

844
01:29:25,194 --> 01:29:30,741
Bed and breakfast in Isengard. Understand?

845
01:30:00,479 --> 01:30:03,065
- They are alive.
- One of them, anyway.

846
01:30:03,232 --> 01:30:05,818
Pippin, I think, by the footprints.

847
01:30:05,984 --> 01:30:08,737
How far ahead of us are they now,
Aragorn?

848
01:30:08,904 --> 01:30:13,909
Almost a day. Shall we rest by night,
or go on while our strength holds?

849
01:30:14,076 --> 01:30:15,911
Do you think the Orcs will rest?

850
01:30:16,078 --> 01:30:20,916
Yet, in the dark we may lose the trail,
or miss a sign, like that brooch.

851
01:30:21,083 --> 01:30:26,713
- There will be no more signs.
- I cannot run all the way to Isengard.

852
01:30:49,736 --> 01:30:52,614
Rohan. Rohan.

853
01:32:07,856 --> 01:32:10,150
Thank goodness for that rope
the Elves gave you.

854
01:32:10,317 --> 01:32:13,237
We'd never have gotten down
that last cliff without it.

855
01:32:22,496 --> 01:32:25,374
There's that Mount Doom again,
Mr. Frodo. See it?

856
01:32:36,593 --> 01:32:37,928
What a fix!

857
01:32:38,095 --> 01:32:40,764
The one place
that we don't want to see any closer...

858
01:32:40,931 --> 01:32:43,684
and that's the one place
we're trying to get to.

859
01:32:47,187 --> 01:32:49,690
We're plain lost, Mr. Frodo.

860
01:32:56,572 --> 01:32:59,324
I'm tired, Sam.
I don't know what's to be done.

861
01:32:59,491 --> 01:33:04,413
We must find a place to camp, I suppose.
Maybe there'll be a path tomorrow.

862
01:33:11,795 --> 01:33:15,382
Cautious, my precious.

863
01:33:24,141 --> 01:33:25,767
Don't turn!

864
01:33:26,602 --> 01:33:28,020
It's him.

865
01:33:34,109 --> 01:33:37,571
That Gollum?
That thing who had Mr. Bilbo's ring?

866
01:33:37,738 --> 01:33:39,364
He's been following us since Moria.

867
01:33:39,531 --> 01:33:45,287
My precious. More haste, less speed.

868
01:33:46,038 --> 01:33:48,540
Well, he'll be sorry he found us again.

869
01:33:48,707 --> 01:33:53,211
Be careful.
He's much more dangerous than he looks.

870
01:34:01,678 --> 01:34:05,891
Where is it, my precious?

871
01:34:06,058 --> 01:34:10,812
It's ours, it is, and we wants it.

872
01:34:14,316 --> 01:34:16,401
Got you, you spying...

873
01:34:21,406 --> 01:34:24,534
Let go, Gollum.
Let go, or I'll cut your throat!

874
01:34:24,701 --> 01:34:28,288
Don't hurt us.
Don't let them hurt us, precious.

875
01:34:28,455 --> 01:34:31,124
Cruel little Hobbitses.

876
01:34:32,501 --> 01:34:37,255
Jumps on us
like cats on poor mices, Gollum.

877
01:34:37,673 --> 01:34:43,178
We'll be nice to them if they'll be nice
to us, won't we, precious?

878
01:34:44,221 --> 01:34:47,516
Pity Mr. Bilbo didn't kill the creature
when he had the chance.

879
01:34:48,475 --> 01:34:50,185
I will not touch him.

880
01:34:50,352 --> 01:34:51,978
Now that I see him, I do pity him.

881
01:34:52,145 --> 01:34:56,900
Yes, Hobbits won't kill us?
Nice Hobbits, huh?

882
01:34:57,067 --> 01:34:59,861
No, we won't.
But we won't let you go, either.

883
01:35:00,028 --> 01:35:02,364
You will have to come with us
and help us, if you can.

884
01:35:02,531 --> 01:35:06,993
Ooh, yes. Yes, indeed. Nice Hobbits.

885
01:35:08,578 --> 01:35:13,125
And where are they going in these cold,
hard lands, we wonder?

886
01:35:13,291 --> 01:35:15,377
We are going to Mordor, Gollum.
You know that.

887
01:35:15,544 --> 01:35:17,045
Lead us to the gates of his land.

888
01:35:19,381 --> 01:35:23,135
No. No, precious.
Hobbits mustn't go there.

889
01:35:23,301 --> 01:35:25,679
Gollum, Gollum. Leave us alone!

890
01:35:26,430 --> 01:35:28,223
Gotcha!

891
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:32,644
I think your rope
might prove useful again, Sam.

892
01:35:32,811 --> 01:35:35,313
Tie one end to his ankle.
We want him to walk.

893
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:39,234
Don't hurt us! No, no, no.

894
01:35:44,156 --> 01:35:50,078
It burns. It bites. It freezes.
Take it off us. It hurts us.

895
01:35:50,245 --> 01:35:53,123
- Don't you do it, Mr. Frodo.
- It hurts us.

896
01:35:53,290 --> 01:35:55,417
What promise can you give me
that I can trust?

897
01:35:55,584 --> 01:35:59,129
Sméagol will be very good.

898
01:35:59,296 --> 01:36:02,674
Sméagol will swear
never to let him have it.

899
01:36:02,841 --> 01:36:05,051
Sméagol will save it.

900
01:36:05,218 --> 01:36:08,930
The precious is before you, Sméagol.
Speak your promise.

901
01:36:10,474 --> 01:36:14,603
We promises, yes, I promise...

902
01:36:14,770 --> 01:36:18,273
I will serve the master of the precious.

903
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:21,777
Good master. Good Sméagol.

904
01:36:21,943 --> 01:36:23,612
Take the rope off, Sam.

905
01:36:27,032 --> 01:36:29,618
Off we go. Follow Sméagol.

906
01:36:30,243 --> 01:36:34,831
Sméagol knows a secret way, he does,
across the marshes.

907
01:36:34,998 --> 01:36:37,793
Follow Sméagol. Follow.

908
01:36:37,959 --> 01:36:41,630
It's far. Far, nice hobbits.

909
01:37:16,581 --> 01:37:20,210
I said no shooting.

910
01:37:20,377 --> 01:37:26,049
You're wasting arrows, dunghill swine.

911
01:37:31,263 --> 01:37:36,184
Snaga, Lugdush, stand guard.

912
01:37:36,351 --> 01:37:38,061
Bind their legs.

913
01:37:38,228 --> 01:37:43,191
Whiteskins break through. Understand?

914
01:37:43,358 --> 01:37:48,905
You and your stinking wizard.
You got us into this.

915
01:37:49,072 --> 01:37:52,200
When I tell them in Mordor...

916
01:37:57,956 --> 01:37:59,749
They are far.

917
01:38:00,542 --> 01:38:01,710
Far away.

918
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:26,860
Stinking Wizard doesn't get you,
the Whiteskins will.

919
01:38:27,027 --> 01:38:31,239
You won't get it that way.
It isn't easy to find.

920
01:38:31,406 --> 01:38:34,951
Get it? Get what?

921
01:38:35,118 --> 01:38:38,330
Nothing, my precious.

922
01:38:40,707 --> 01:38:43,293
It's no good groping in the dark.

923
01:38:43,460 --> 01:38:45,045
Uglúk will be back any minute.

924
01:38:45,211 --> 01:38:47,255
Nothing for Mordor.

925
01:38:47,422 --> 01:38:52,302
Nothing for poor Grishnákh. Gollum.

926
01:38:52,469 --> 01:38:57,557
- Untie us, my precious.
- I said to be quiet.

927
01:38:58,183 --> 01:38:59,643
Wait.

928
01:38:59,809 --> 01:39:04,773
- You can't find it without our help.
- You help me?

929
01:40:07,043 --> 01:40:09,713
I don't know what to do now.
I don't even know where we are.

930
01:40:09,879 --> 01:40:13,091
You should have studied
maps more and played less in Rivendell.

931
01:40:13,258 --> 01:40:15,677
This is Fangorn Forest.

932
01:40:15,969 --> 01:40:18,638
Then we're no safer
than we were with the Orcs.

933
01:40:19,014 --> 01:40:24,060
We've no blankets and almost no food. And
it looks like nothing to eat for 100 miles.

934
01:40:24,519 --> 01:40:26,730
We don't even know
where we're trying to get to.

935
01:40:26,896 --> 01:40:28,481
Let's climb up there.

936
01:40:28,648 --> 01:40:31,359
Maybe we can find out
where we are at least.

937
01:40:41,536 --> 01:40:43,455
It's nice here.

938
01:40:43,747 --> 01:40:46,124
The forest looks so different
in the sunlight.

939
01:40:46,291 --> 01:40:47,441
I know.

940
01:40:48,168 --> 01:40:52,172
It's funny, but, well,
I almost feel I like the place.

941
01:40:52,338 --> 01:40:56,176
Almost felt you liked the forest?

942
01:40:56,718 --> 01:41:01,222
That's uncommonly kind of you.

943
01:41:02,474 --> 01:41:05,602
The Orcs made us run. When we couldn't
run anymore, they carried us.

944
01:41:05,769 --> 01:41:08,021
We cut our rope, ran to your hill...

945
01:41:08,188 --> 01:41:12,233
"Hill"? Ooh!

946
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:14,736
A hasty word...

947
01:41:14,903 --> 01:41:20,241
for something that has stood here
since the world was shaped.

948
01:41:22,577 --> 01:41:26,331
You may call me Treebeard.

949
01:41:26,498 --> 01:41:29,084
We thought you were a tree,
standing there.

950
01:41:29,250 --> 01:41:33,338
Not a tree, a tree herder.

951
01:41:33,505 --> 01:41:35,965
Please, Treebeard...

952
01:41:36,132 --> 01:41:38,051
now that you know our story...

953
01:41:39,177 --> 01:41:40,345
whose side are you on?

954
01:41:40,512 --> 01:41:44,057
I am not altogether on anybody's side...

955
01:41:44,224 --> 01:41:48,561
because nobody is altogether on my side.

956
01:41:48,728 --> 01:41:53,149
But I am no friend
of these tree-killing Orcs...

957
01:41:53,316 --> 01:41:55,944
and their masters.

958
01:42:05,829 --> 01:42:08,623
They were here, no doubt of it.

959
01:42:08,790 --> 01:42:13,461
- But where they went...
- I don't understand these other marks.

960
01:42:13,628 --> 01:42:15,046
Look!

961
01:42:17,465 --> 01:42:19,592
Your bow, Legolas. It's Aruman.

962
01:42:19,759 --> 01:42:23,096
- Shoot before he puts a spell on us, quickly.
- Elf...

963
01:42:23,263 --> 01:42:27,433
Man and Dwarf together?

964
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:31,729
- A rare sight in these times.
- Now. Stop him, Legolas.

965
01:42:42,448 --> 01:42:44,367
Gandalf.

966
01:42:44,534 --> 01:42:47,745
Beyond all hope.

967
01:42:47,912 --> 01:42:51,332
- Gandalf!
- Yes.

968
01:42:51,749 --> 01:42:53,585
Yes, that was my name.

969
01:42:54,752 --> 01:42:58,423
But where have you...? Gandalf!

970
01:42:58,590 --> 01:43:03,219
- What happened?
- A long time I fell.

971
01:43:03,428 --> 01:43:08,349
<i>Long I fell and he fell with me.
His fire was about me.</i>

972
01:43:08,516 --> 01:43:09,976
<i>I was burned.</i>

973
01:43:10,143 --> 01:43:14,189
<i>Ever he clutched me, and ever
I hewed him, far under the living earth...</i>

974
01:43:14,355 --> 01:43:18,860
<i>until at last, he fled back up
the secret ways of Moria.</i>

975
01:43:19,027 --> 01:43:22,405
<i>There we fought,
above the mists of the world...</i>

976
01:43:22,572 --> 01:43:25,200
<i>and the mountain was wreathed
with lightning.</i>

977
01:43:25,366 --> 01:43:31,456
<i>I threw down my enemy
and his fall broke the mountainside.</i>

978
01:43:32,415 --> 01:43:34,792
<i>Then darkness took me...</i>

979
01:43:34,959 --> 01:43:39,505
<i>and I wandered far,
on roads that I will not tell.</i>

980
01:43:39,672 --> 01:43:44,552
Naked, I was sent back for a brief time,
until my task was done.

981
01:43:44,719 --> 01:43:46,679
And it is time I was about it.

982
01:43:46,846 --> 01:43:52,685
You come with me to Edoras, my friends,
to the city of the Riders?

983
01:43:52,852 --> 01:43:55,021
To Edoras, now?

984
01:43:56,064 --> 01:43:58,149
But to leave Merry and Pippin?

985
01:43:58,316 --> 01:44:01,236
They are in no danger, believe me.

986
01:44:01,402 --> 01:44:03,404
The great danger is to Edoras.

987
01:44:03,571 --> 01:44:06,574
Saruman's Orcs will attack there
within two days...

988
01:44:06,741 --> 01:44:09,535
and King Théoden has need of us.

989
01:44:10,119 --> 01:44:12,247
<i>Théoden has grown old.</i>

990
01:44:12,413 --> 01:44:14,707
<i>He shivers by his fire now...</i>

991
01:44:14,874 --> 01:44:18,419
<i>and leaves everything in the hands
of his new minister...</i>

992
01:44:18,586 --> 01:44:21,381
<i>Gríma Wormtongue.</i>

993
01:44:21,547 --> 01:44:24,259
<i>Those riders you followed,
who rescued Merry and Pippin...</i>

994
01:44:24,425 --> 01:44:26,886
<i>they were led
by Théoden's nephew, Éomer.</i>

995
01:44:27,512 --> 01:44:30,348
<i>He is all but an outlaw
in Rohan these days.</i>

996
01:44:30,515 --> 01:44:33,059
<i>But he hunts the Orcs
wherever he finds them...</i>

997
01:44:33,226 --> 01:44:35,979
<i>defying Wormtongue's orders
to let them pass.</i>

998
01:44:36,145 --> 01:44:40,149
<i>So Wormtongue calls him traitor
and renegade...</i>

999
01:44:40,316 --> 01:44:41,734
<i>and Théoden believes.</i>

1000
01:44:41,901 --> 01:44:45,863
Gandalf, the Riders of Rohan
are the bravest fighters I ever knew...

1001
01:44:46,030 --> 01:44:47,782
but they were never many.

1002
01:44:47,949 --> 01:44:53,288
<i>If Saruman strikes now,
he will overrun Edoras in a single night.</i>

1003
01:44:56,916 --> 01:44:59,460
Our time is at hand.

1004
01:44:59,627 --> 01:45:03,631
Théoden's hundreds will face
your tens of thousands.

1005
01:45:07,093 --> 01:45:11,472
And when all of Rohan,
your ancient oppressor, lies vanquished...

1006
01:45:11,639 --> 01:45:14,142
then shall we fly eastward...

1007
01:45:14,309 --> 01:45:18,688
and sweep all of Middle-earth
beneath our feet.

1008
01:45:18,855 --> 01:45:21,399
We cannot be defeated!

1009
01:45:31,284 --> 01:45:35,163
Halfway between Edoras and
Isengard, there lies an old, strong fortress...

1010
01:45:35,330 --> 01:45:37,498
<i>that Men call Helm's Deep.</i>

1011
01:45:37,665 --> 01:45:40,001
<i>If we can decoy Saruman's Orcs there...</i>

1012
01:45:40,168 --> 01:45:44,172
<i>the fortress will stop them longer
than the wooden halls of Edoras.</i>

1013
01:45:44,339 --> 01:45:48,926
- We are buying time, Aragorn.
- Time? Time for what?

1014
01:45:49,093 --> 01:45:50,720
Perhaps for a miracle.

1015
01:45:51,304 --> 01:45:54,432
Perhaps only for Frodo
to get a little further on his way...

1016
01:45:54,599 --> 01:45:57,268
while the armies
that should be hunting for the Ring...

1017
01:45:57,435 --> 01:46:01,022
waste their own time destroying us.

1018
01:46:10,948 --> 01:46:12,098
I have returned.

1019
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:17,705
The storm comes swiftly, and it is time
for all friends to gather together.

1020
01:46:18,414 --> 01:46:19,749
And...

1021
01:46:19,916 --> 01:46:21,209
do you...

1022
01:46:21,376 --> 01:46:22,377
expect me...

1023
01:46:22,543 --> 01:46:25,296
to welcome you here...

1024
01:46:25,463 --> 01:46:27,840
Master Gandalf?

1025
01:46:28,216 --> 01:46:31,552
Troubles follow you like crows.

1026
01:46:31,719 --> 01:46:35,640
Why should I welcome you,
Gandalf Stormcrow?

1027
01:46:36,307 --> 01:46:41,104
Justly spoken, Lord.
In the east, the Dark Lord is stirring.

1028
01:46:41,270 --> 01:46:43,648
In Lórien, the sorceress
of the Golden Wood...

1029
01:46:43,815 --> 01:46:45,608
weaves her webs of deceit.

1030
01:46:45,775 --> 01:46:51,572
And such is the hour
in which this wanderer chooses to return.

1031
01:46:51,739 --> 01:46:53,074
It is I...

1032
01:46:53,241 --> 01:46:56,953
who counsel the King now.
He hears you no longer.

1033
01:46:57,120 --> 01:46:59,288
No, Gríma Wormtongue.

1034
01:46:59,455 --> 01:47:03,418
He hears nothing but your voice
telling him that he rules here...

1035
01:47:03,584 --> 01:47:06,254
only because Aruman is kind
to old men...

1036
01:47:06,421 --> 01:47:09,715
and that the best thing
for a sickly, feeble king...

1037
01:47:09,882 --> 01:47:13,845
is to let wizards and Orcs
do as they will in Rohan.

1038
01:47:14,011 --> 01:47:18,724
I am my own man, Gandalf...

1039
01:47:19,183 --> 01:47:20,893
as I was.

1040
01:47:22,103 --> 01:47:24,230
It is true that...

1041
01:47:24,397 --> 01:47:29,444
Gríma advises me often to leave
Aruman in peace...

1042
01:47:29,610 --> 01:47:33,489
Hear, my Lord, you tire yourself.
You are still unwell.

1043
01:47:33,656 --> 01:47:37,785
And he does remind me
that it would be safest for Rohan...

1044
01:47:37,952 --> 01:47:41,080
to seek their friendship,
no matter how I may feel!

1045
01:47:41,247 --> 01:47:45,334
Dear Lord, let me deal with
these troublesome guests.

1046
01:47:45,501 --> 01:47:48,713
How long has it been,
Gríma Wormtongue?

1047
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:51,466
How long since Aruman bought you?

1048
01:47:52,967 --> 01:47:55,845
For I saw you at Isengard.

1049
01:47:57,305 --> 01:48:01,809
Did I not counsel
your doorkeeper to forbid his staff?

1050
01:48:01,976 --> 01:48:05,146
Down, snake.

1051
01:48:05,313 --> 01:48:08,399
Down on your belly.

1052
01:48:09,984 --> 01:48:12,612
Gríma is often...

1053
01:48:12,778 --> 01:48:16,991
at Isengard.
I send him there with messages.

1054
01:48:17,158 --> 01:48:20,077
And he returns with poison.

1055
01:48:20,244 --> 01:48:23,289
Aruman's poison in your ears,
Théoden king.

1056
01:48:23,456 --> 01:48:29,128
Chilling your heart, making you old.
Take courage, Lord of Rohan!

1057
01:48:29,295 --> 01:48:31,005
Gríma...

1058
01:48:31,881 --> 01:48:33,966
is this so?

1059
01:48:34,133 --> 01:48:37,178
I will not harm you, Gríma.

1060
01:48:38,054 --> 01:48:40,389
Is it so?

1061
01:48:49,232 --> 01:48:52,276
Ah! Let him go!

1062
01:48:55,696 --> 01:48:59,325
My sister-daughter, Éowyn.

1063
01:49:00,701 --> 01:49:02,370
My only loyal kin...

1064
01:49:02,537 --> 01:49:06,249
since her brother has disobeyed
my commands.

1065
01:49:06,415 --> 01:49:09,502
Wormtongue's command, Théoden.

1066
01:49:09,669 --> 01:49:11,295
If Éomer had not defied him...

1067
01:49:11,462 --> 01:49:13,297
our cause might be already lost.

1068
01:49:13,464 --> 01:49:16,175
Tell me, Gandalf...

1069
01:49:16,342 --> 01:49:18,761
what I must do now.

1070
01:49:18,928 --> 01:49:21,472
We cannot wait here
for Saruman's attack.

1071
01:49:21,639 --> 01:49:24,225
Every man that can ride
must be sent immediately...

1072
01:49:24,392 --> 01:49:27,436
to the old fortress of Helm's Deep.

1073
01:49:28,312 --> 01:49:32,233
When Saruman learns
that we have gone there, and he will...

1074
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:34,902
we will have the Riders of Rohan.

1075
01:49:35,069 --> 01:49:37,780
I will find Éomer and his Riders.

1076
01:49:37,947 --> 01:49:39,240
My armor!

1077
01:50:02,096 --> 01:50:04,974
Look for me at Helm's Deep.

1078
01:50:14,942 --> 01:50:17,778
Ha-ha-ha. And he's gone again...

1079
01:50:17,945 --> 01:50:20,239
like a wind in the grass.

1080
01:50:20,406 --> 01:50:22,742
Stormcrow.

1081
01:50:23,701 --> 01:50:25,870
- Aragorn.
- My Lord?

1082
01:50:26,037 --> 01:50:28,164
Is there any hope for us?

1083
01:51:07,620 --> 01:51:10,998
Oh, Sam, you simpleminded...

1084
01:51:11,165 --> 01:51:13,000
Fell asleep.

1085
01:51:14,377 --> 01:51:16,921
Mr. Frodo, he's gone.

1086
01:51:17,088 --> 01:51:21,008
- Sméagol?
- He's gone. I didn't mean to sleep.

1087
01:51:21,175 --> 01:51:24,178
Well, he'll come back.
Promise will hold him a while yet.

1088
01:51:24,887 --> 01:51:27,348
He won't leave his precious, anyway.

1089
01:51:28,391 --> 01:51:29,558
Are we rested?

1090
01:51:30,017 --> 01:51:33,562
Hmm? Ready to go on...

1091
01:51:34,230 --> 01:51:36,148
nice Hobbitses?

1092
01:51:37,274 --> 01:51:39,527
Trust Sméagol now?

1093
01:52:01,090 --> 01:52:02,550
Shivery light.

1094
01:52:02,717 --> 01:52:05,469
Nasty. Nasty.

1095
01:52:05,636 --> 01:52:07,096
Look!

1096
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:14,562
Wraiths.

1097
01:52:14,729 --> 01:52:20,735
Wraiths on wings.
The precious is calling them.

1098
01:52:44,467 --> 01:52:49,180
Gollum, wait, Mr. Frodo can't keep up.
Slow down, I tell you.

1099
01:52:49,346 --> 01:52:51,807
No time, no time.

1100
01:52:51,974 --> 01:52:54,935
The precious is heavy, yes.

1101
01:52:55,436 --> 01:52:58,439
Very heavy. Sméagol knows.

1102
01:52:59,315 --> 01:53:02,902
If it's too heavy for nice Master...

1103
01:53:03,068 --> 01:53:05,488
little Sméagol will carry it.

1104
01:53:05,654 --> 01:53:10,785
Sméagol doesn't mind.
Give it to Sméagol.

1105
01:53:10,951 --> 01:53:13,954
Do not say that again. Do not think it.

1106
01:53:14,705 --> 01:53:17,208
Before you touched the precious
ever again, Sméagol...

1107
01:53:17,374 --> 01:53:20,836
I would put it on and command you
to leap off a cliff, or into a fire...

1108
01:53:21,003 --> 01:53:22,546
and you would do it, Sméagol.

1109
01:53:24,799 --> 01:53:29,178
Nice, Master. Nice, Master. Nice.

1110
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:54,662
Sméagol promised. Yes.
Yes, we promised to save our precious...

1111
01:53:54,829 --> 01:53:57,665
never to let him have it,
but it's going to him.

1112
01:53:57,832 --> 01:54:02,044
My precious is nearer every step.

1113
01:54:02,211 --> 01:54:05,965
I can't help it.
Sméagol promised to help nice Hobbit.

1114
01:54:06,131 --> 01:54:10,845
He took cruel rope off our leg.
He speaks nicely to me.

1115
01:54:11,011 --> 01:54:14,014
He's a Baggins, my precious.
A Baggins stoled it.

1116
01:54:14,181 --> 01:54:20,354
We hates Bagginses.
Must have the precious. Must have it.

1117
01:54:20,521 --> 01:54:23,774
We wants it. We wants it.

1118
01:54:23,941 --> 01:54:26,402
But there's two of them.

1119
01:54:26,944 --> 01:54:28,404
Yes.

1120
01:54:28,737 --> 01:54:33,492
We needs help, precious.
She might help, yes.

1121
01:54:33,659 --> 01:54:36,537
She might help us.

1122
01:54:36,704 --> 01:54:41,125
But Sméagol promised nice Hobbit.

1123
01:54:41,292 --> 01:54:42,543
Oh...

1124
01:54:43,210 --> 01:54:47,214
Nice. Nice Hobbit.

1125
01:54:47,381 --> 01:54:49,216
Hey, you.

1126
01:54:49,383 --> 01:54:51,468
What are you pawing at him for?

1127
01:54:51,635 --> 01:54:55,097
Where you been anyway,
sneaking off and sneaking back?

1128
01:54:57,391 --> 01:55:01,520
Sneaking? Sneaking?

1129
01:55:01,812 --> 01:55:04,815
Hobbit's always so polite, yes.

1130
01:55:04,982 --> 01:55:08,944
Tired, thirsty Sméagol. He finds
a secret way through the mountain.

1131
01:55:09,111 --> 01:55:15,910
A tunnel with no Orcses anywhere,
and they say "sneak." "Sneak"?

1132
01:55:16,368 --> 01:55:19,580
Well, you startled me. I'm sorry.

1133
01:55:22,666 --> 01:55:24,543
Hello, Sméagol.

1134
01:55:24,835 --> 01:55:27,546
- Where have you been?
- Sneaking! Hmph!

1135
01:55:42,144 --> 01:55:46,482
I like this place. There is good rock here.

1136
01:55:46,649 --> 01:55:49,610
This country has tough bones.

1137
01:56:07,878 --> 01:56:12,341
Up on the ridge. They're coming.
Here they are!

1138
02:00:39,483 --> 02:00:42,069
Fire of Isengard!

1139
02:00:46,865 --> 02:00:50,118
We're breached! Retreat to the caves!

1140
02:00:50,285 --> 02:00:52,746
The caves!

1141
02:02:25,922 --> 02:02:28,800
Théoden king.

1142
02:02:28,967 --> 02:02:31,053
I will not end here...

1143
02:02:31,219 --> 02:02:34,014
taken like an old badger in a trap.

1144
02:02:34,181 --> 02:02:36,183
When dawn comes...

1145
02:02:36,350 --> 02:02:39,269
I will bid men sound Helm's horn...

1146
02:02:39,436 --> 02:02:41,813
and I will ride forth.

1147
02:02:41,980 --> 02:02:45,817
Will you ride with me then,
son of Arathorn?

1148
02:02:45,984 --> 02:02:49,321
At least, we may make such an end...

1149
02:02:49,488 --> 02:02:52,032
as will be worth a song.

1150
02:02:53,533 --> 02:02:55,535
I will ride with you.

1151
02:03:04,878 --> 02:03:06,213
We're there, Sam.

1152
02:03:06,922 --> 02:03:08,382
Another day, maybe two.

1153
02:03:08,548 --> 02:03:11,551
When light comes tomorrow,
you'll see how near the mountains are.

1154
02:03:11,718 --> 02:03:16,556
Well, it's a good thing, Mr. Frodo,
because we're running awful low on food.

1155
02:03:16,723 --> 02:03:20,394
I reckon we've got enough left
to see us to this Mount Doom.

1156
02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:23,063
After that, I don't know.

1157
02:03:25,732 --> 02:03:27,442
Oh, Sam.

1158
02:03:27,609 --> 02:03:29,569
Samwise Gamgee.

1159
02:03:29,736 --> 02:03:33,532
My dearest Hobbit, friend of friends.

1160
02:03:33,698 --> 02:03:37,411
After that? If the Ring goes into the fire,
and we're at hand...

1161
02:03:37,577 --> 02:03:39,913
after that, dear Sam...

1162
02:03:40,080 --> 02:03:41,373
I wouldn't worry.

1163
02:03:41,540 --> 02:03:45,502
Just to get there. Just to get there.

1164
02:03:45,669 --> 02:03:48,797
The Ring is so heavy now, Sam.

1165
02:04:00,642 --> 02:04:03,145
We must go.

1166
02:04:03,770 --> 02:04:06,606
Mustn't rest here, silly Hobbits.

1167
02:04:07,065 --> 02:04:13,905
Orcs find us. Ringwraiths find us.
Must go on to safe, secret place.

1168
02:04:14,072 --> 02:04:16,116
Sméagol's secret way!

1169
02:04:16,283 --> 02:04:17,826
The straight stair...

1170
02:04:17,993 --> 02:04:20,120
and the winding stair.

1171
02:04:20,287 --> 02:04:23,457
Up, up, up...

1172
02:04:23,623 --> 02:04:27,127
through black, sharp mountains.

1173
02:04:27,586 --> 02:04:29,004
Follow good Sméagol.

1174
02:04:47,355 --> 02:04:50,192
Straight stair, winding stair...

1175
02:04:50,358 --> 02:04:52,194
what comes after that?

1176
02:04:52,360 --> 02:04:56,239
We shall see. Oh, yes...

1177
02:04:56,490 --> 02:04:58,783
we shall see.

1178
02:09:10,076 --> 02:09:13,538
Gandalf!

1179
02:09:13,705 --> 02:09:17,542
Gandalf!

1180
02:10:18,394 --> 02:10:20,730
<i>The forces of darkness were driven forever...</i>

1181
02:10:20,897 --> 02:10:22,732
<i>from the face of Middle-earth...</i>

1182
02:10:22,899 --> 02:10:25,527
<i>by the valiant friends of Frodo.</i>

1183
02:10:25,693 --> 02:10:27,987
<i>As their gallant battle ended...</i>

1184
02:10:28,154 --> 02:10:31,324
<i>so too ends the first great tale of...</i>

1185
02:10:31,491 --> 02:10:34,494
The Lord of the Rings.

1185
02:10:35,305 --> 02:11:35,874
