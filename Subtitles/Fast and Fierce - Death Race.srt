3
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,203
Welcome to Navojoa.

4
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:16,509
Little brother.

5
00:01:17,345 --> 00:01:19,746
Jack.

6
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:21,848
Weren't at your hotel,
so I figured this'd be

7
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,750
the next place to find you.

8
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:25,585
Right, well, you could
have waited for me to come

9
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:26,988
and find you when I
was ready to talk,

10
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:30,324
but that's not
your style, is it?

11
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:34,594
I know this isn't something
you wanted to do, coming here.

12
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:36,030
On the contrary,

13
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:37,564
this used to be one of
the most incredible

14
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,467
junkyards I ever saw.

15
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:42,769
Now look at it...

16
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,105
there's almost nothing left.

17
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:48,075
You know what I meant.
Ryan, I...

18
00:01:48,142 --> 00:01:50,277
- I meant...
- I know what you meant.

19
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,548
What kinda trouble you in?

20
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:30,617
I'm all in.

21
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:38,192
Whew...
how much you need?

22
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:43,696
You know, man, you don't have
to throw it back in my face.

23
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:46,367
I know you've bailed
me out before...

24
00:02:46,434 --> 00:02:48,369
I know.
I get it.

25
00:02:48,436 --> 00:02:49,403
That's not what I meant.

26
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,837
Yeah.

27
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:52,173
Listen, I just wanna
help you get right.

28
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,873
So if you need cash,
I'll get some...

29
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:55,608
No, it's not cash,
it's not cash.

30
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,011
Cash won't do this time.

31
00:02:58,546 --> 00:03:00,214
Well, then what is it?

32
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:15,262
- Four ladies.
- Oh!

33
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:28,641
Diamonds are not
a girl's best friend.

34
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:44,158
How is it that you're such
a fuck-up

35
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:46,293
when your brother Jack is out
there winning all the time?

36
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,760
What is that like?

37
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:53,666
You guys still close?

38
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:57,404
Well, you're gonna need him.

39
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:00,941
We need him.

40
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:03,177
Need him for what?

41
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:05,778
We need him to run the Outlaw.

42
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,351
Davie, listen, man...

43
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:15,089
it's out of the question.
Look, I can...

44
00:04:15,156 --> 00:04:18,559
I will pay you back every
last dollar that I owe you.

45
00:04:18,626 --> 00:04:20,060
I will.

46
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:30,104
It's not about a choice.

47
00:04:30,171 --> 00:04:33,207
Actually, it is a choice...

48
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:38,312
do I kill you now,

49
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:40,747
or do I give you a chance
to redeem yourself.

50
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,252
Jack thinks as highly
of me as you do.

51
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,390
He will never race the Outlaw.

52
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:53,027
Not even to save the life
of his little brother?

53
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:59,433
Man, there's no way.

54
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,767
He won't do it.

55
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,973
Are you willing to bet
your life on this?

56
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:12,812
There's a race,
it's called the Outlaw.

57
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,847
This year it's Mexico to L.A.

58
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,584
God, you got
some balls, man...

59
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,587
some fucking balls, coming
down here, asking me that.

60
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,222
I retired, man.

61
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:23,224
I got outta the race game,
and I've stayed there.

62
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,525
Yeah, you think
I don't know that?

63
00:05:24,592 --> 00:05:26,026
Get your stuff.

64
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:28,462
I'm driving you back
to the States myself.

65
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:30,664
I'm in a really bad
place with this guy, man,

66
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,266
a really bad place.

67
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:35,369
He has people...
people that will find me.

68
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:38,973
I can't be looking
over my shoulder

69
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,374
for the rest of my life.

70
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:46,513
Get in the car.

71
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:36,597
It looks like
I'm the oldest guy here

72
00:06:36,664 --> 00:06:40,100
by about at least
15 years, huh?

73
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:42,269
At least you got experience
on your side.

74
00:06:42,336 --> 00:06:44,438
Or I'm too stupid to know
I shouldn't be here.

75
00:06:52,313 --> 00:06:53,247
Is that the guy?

76
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:56,717
Good evening, racers.

77
00:06:56,784 --> 00:06:59,453
Welcome to this year's
running of the Outlaw 1000.

78
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,056
This year's race starts
in Navojoa,

79
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:03,991
and it's 1,000 miles
to Los Angeles.

80
00:07:04,058 --> 00:07:06,760
The winner...
$5 million.

81
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,962
I don't care how you get there,

82
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,731
but it has to be on four wheels,

83
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:12,966
and there's three checkpoints
that you must hit along the way.

84
00:07:14,368 --> 00:07:16,036
The checkpoints
have been preprogrammed

85
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:17,738
into your GPS systems.

86
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:19,573
Is that all of them?

87
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:23,210
Oh!

88
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:26,580
Ladies and gentlemen, we have
royalty in the house tonight...

89
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:28,382
Mr. Jack Tyson.

90
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:30,651
This motherfucker done
won more races

91
00:07:30,718 --> 00:07:32,419
than any redneck in NASCAR.

92
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:34,421
Did you point a gun
at my brother?

93
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,026
As a matter of fact, I did...

94
00:07:39,093 --> 00:07:40,160
and here you are.

95
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:41,962
Jack, Jack, wait, wait, wait!

96
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:43,430
Your brother owes me
a lot of money.

97
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:47,101
But if you win this race,
the debt will be paid.

98
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:48,936
Nelson, did you not explain?

99
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:50,704
Yeah, I did.
Come on.

100
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:52,172
Come on!

101
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:54,808
This is why you don't
meet your heroes.

102
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:56,477
Put a muzzle on
that fucking dog!

103
00:08:06,387 --> 00:08:07,688
What were you trying
to prove back there?

104
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:09,289
Get your hands off of me.

105
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:11,291
You can't mess around
with a guy like Davie.

106
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:13,893
Don't tell me you're
afraid of a grown-ass man

107
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:15,429
that goes by the
name of "Davie."

108
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:16,663
Shut the fuck up!

109
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,332
Fuck you, man!

110
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:21,468
Hey...

111
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:22,936
what would have happened
if I wouldn't

112
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,138
have come down here,
huh, Nelson?

113
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:26,106
How would that have looked?

114
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,775
You'd take a bullet
from this asshole?

115
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,309
Why?

116
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:32,479
What do you want me
to tell you, man?

117
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:36,316
I kept losing, all right, and
he was the only game in town.

118
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:39,520
He saw you coming, man, and
he gave you just enough rope.

119
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:41,488
Guys like that?

120
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:43,891
They can spot the real
compulsive gamblers a mile away.

121
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:45,325
Shut up, man.

122
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:46,794
When are you gonna
get it together, man?

123
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,095
Seriously.

124
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,232
What are you even
still doing in Mexico?

125
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:54,501
You had the money to get out.

126
00:08:57,337 --> 00:08:58,539
I didn't have it.

127
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,110
You didn't have it?

128
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:07,381
Is there a problem here?

129
00:09:07,448 --> 00:09:09,216
You know what?

130
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:10,851
You could tell Davie
to take it all

131
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:12,820
and shove it right up his ass.

132
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,655
Him and I, we're not done.

133
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,890
Not even close.

134
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:20,060
Ooh, charming, Jack.

135
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:24,198
Why don't you take this anger

136
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:27,534
and channel it into
winning this race?

137
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:01,668
Drivers ready!

138
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:03,337
Nina!

139
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:05,639
You about to find out about
these eight seconds.

140
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:08,408
Still not as quick as your
boyfriend in bed, though.

141
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:14,114
This ain't no
rally race, homeboy.

142
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:44,111
Three...

143
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:48,782
two...

144
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,820
Go!

145
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:35,095
Jack is still one
hell of a driver.

146
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:36,630
Shame he's such
a fucking prick.

147
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:40,434
I bet it's killing you
on the inside,

148
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,202
not putting any money
on him to win.

149
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:45,238
Go to hell, Davie.

150
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:47,075
I'll tell you what...

151
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,409
I'll float you 100k.

152
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:52,379
I mean, what kind of guy
would I be to not let you

153
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:54,314
get in on the action?

154
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:05,192
All right.

155
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:15,435
How come there's not much
riding on Jack up there?

156
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:17,537
Maybe they know something
we don't know.

157
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:20,741
Well, that's crap.

158
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:23,176
What's with this
hidden camera shit?

159
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,113
Paranoid much?

160
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:27,314
Why don't you just shut the
fuck up and watch the race?

161
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,240
Fucking Jack Tyson
needle dick.

162
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:58,278
Who the fuck is Jack Tyson?

163
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:27,240
Yeah, where the fuck
you at, Grandpa?

164
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:57,404
Fuck.

165
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:00,807
Let's go.

166
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:03,510
Shit, oh, shit!

167
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:06,513
Fucking Hot Wheel driver.

168
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:16,389
Come on.

169
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,795
I got you.
No way, not today.

170
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:26,968
Not today, come on, let's go.

171
00:15:17,118 --> 00:15:18,618
Welcome to checkpoint one.

172
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:19,853
You are?

173
00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:23,323
Jack.

174
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,825
So this is it, huh?

175
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:29,796
Well, congratulations on
first place for checkpoint one.

176
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:37,905
Mr. Davie?

177
00:15:37,972 --> 00:15:42,375
I've got a Mr. Jack in the
restaurant, first place.

178
00:15:44,045 --> 00:15:45,879
Si, senor, will do.

179
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:50,417
He'd like to congratulate you
on your first-place win.

180
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:52,053
Ah. Yeah, sure.

181
00:15:54,021 --> 00:15:55,655
So Davie owns this place?

182
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:58,758
Si, he's owned it
for many years.

183
00:16:03,597 --> 00:16:04,731
For the winner.

184
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:17,711
And once all the other
drivers are here,

185
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:21,015
lunch will be served, okay?

186
00:16:32,626 --> 00:16:34,861
Goddamn it, fuck.

187
00:17:10,264 --> 00:17:13,633
Hola, race fans,
it's your girl, Six-Speed Nina,

188
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:18,205
and I am here at
El Tesoro Escondido,

189
00:17:18,272 --> 00:17:19,974
in the town of Hermosio.

190
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,842
And it's our first stop
in the Outlaw 1000.

191
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,979
And you'd better believe
I'll be chowing down

192
00:17:25,046 --> 00:17:27,281
on some bean burritos
before our race moves

193
00:17:27,348 --> 00:17:29,716
to our next stop,
Puerto Penasco.

194
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:34,121
Can I ask you what
the hell you're doing?

195
00:17:34,188 --> 00:17:36,790
Well, I'm posting to all
my followers on Instagram.

196
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:39,193
You know, checking in
every stop of the way,

197
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,228
letting them ride shotgun
all the way to L.A.

198
00:17:41,295 --> 00:17:44,165
Or letting the cops know where
we're going all the way to L.A.

199
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:45,865
You don't wanna go
around broadcasting

200
00:17:45,933 --> 00:17:47,567
where you're going
unless you want to get

201
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:49,469
pulled over and arrested.

202
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:50,737
The Mexican police
don't follow me.

203
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:52,739
Well, they will be
before long.

204
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:55,542
Says here you retired...

205
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:56,944
like three years ago.

206
00:17:58,379 --> 00:18:01,115
And the last time you won
something was longer than that.

207
00:18:04,986 --> 00:18:07,787
So what's Davie
inviting you for?

208
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:09,556
Your guess is as good as mine.

209
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:10,724
But when I buzzed
you back there,

210
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,360
you didn't know what to do,

211
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:15,096
so you don't have any
street reflexes whatsoever.

212
00:18:15,162 --> 00:18:16,629
But I guess that's
the difference between racing

213
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:18,132
on a closed track
against a clock

214
00:18:18,199 --> 00:18:19,467
versus having another man
in the next lane?

215
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:20,734
Is that right?

216
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,470
Let me guess...

217
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:25,072
the real skill comes from
doing 90 in a pedestrian zone

218
00:18:25,139 --> 00:18:27,141
and losing control
and plowing into a family

219
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,377
who's coming home from
having ice cream?

220
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:33,414
Is that how you hone
your "street reflexes," bro?

221
00:18:33,481 --> 00:18:34,448
Watch your mouth, Grandpa.

222
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:36,150
Easy, guys... easy.

223
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:42,356
It's okay, kid.

224
00:18:42,423 --> 00:18:45,292
You know what, I was pretty
stupid when I was your age, too.

225
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:47,627
Yeah, when was that?
Before the car was invented?

226
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:50,031
Something like that.

227
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,301
I'll see you out there.

228
00:18:54,368 --> 00:18:56,870
Sure... just not for long.

229
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:09,649
Good luck, guys.

230
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,935
Who's there?

231
00:20:02,136 --> 00:20:04,505
Can you show me that
10-second car now?

232
00:20:04,572 --> 00:20:05,805
Eat a dick, Nina.

233
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:08,175
Whatever.

234
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,108
Gotcha!

235
00:20:41,175 --> 00:20:42,543
Bitch!

236
00:20:58,092 --> 00:20:59,126
Ah!

237
00:21:17,978 --> 00:21:19,280
- Drive! Drive! Drive!
- What's going on?

238
00:21:31,091 --> 00:21:33,427
Jack has really come
through so far.

239
00:21:33,494 --> 00:21:36,829
Yeah, for you, but nobody
else is betting on him.

240
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:39,899
One point eight mil?
Really?

241
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:42,536
Man, you said it yourself...

242
00:21:42,603 --> 00:21:43,904
he's retired.

243
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:46,407
Been outta the race game
for a while.

244
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:48,909
These other kids are hot
in the circuit right now.

245
00:21:48,976 --> 00:21:50,578
They're street punks.

246
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:54,881
They've got more recognition,
recent popularity...

247
00:21:54,949 --> 00:21:56,951
things your brother
does not have.

248
00:21:59,353 --> 00:22:01,854
Gillian, make the transfers
to the winners.

249
00:22:01,922 --> 00:22:05,559
Alert the losers
that stage two is starting.

250
00:22:05,626 --> 00:22:07,461
Okay.

251
00:22:11,731 --> 00:22:14,034
I'm gonna need your name,
or you're gonna need to get out.

252
00:22:14,101 --> 00:22:15,336
Is that a threat?

253
00:22:15,402 --> 00:22:16,937
You don't know anything
about me.

254
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:18,372
Maybe I don't do well
with threats.

255
00:22:18,439 --> 00:22:19,640
Maybe I'm about to
stab you in the face

256
00:22:19,707 --> 00:22:20,708
and take this goddamn thing?

257
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:23,344
Oh, yeah?
All right.

258
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:26,313
Just wanted to know who I was
in the car with, that's all.

259
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,084
Name's Bianca.

260
00:22:31,318 --> 00:22:33,020
Hello, Bianca.

261
00:22:33,087 --> 00:22:36,223
You mind telling me
what happened back there?

262
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:38,525
You wanna tell me
who you are first?

263
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:40,461
It's only polite.

264
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:42,263
Now we're being polite.

265
00:22:42,329 --> 00:22:45,466
All right, fine...
my name's Jack.

266
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:47,167
Jack Tyson.

267
00:22:47,234 --> 00:22:48,235
Jack?

268
00:22:48,302 --> 00:22:50,704
You're the guy...
oh, thank God.

269
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,606
You know who I am?

270
00:22:52,673 --> 00:22:53,941
You're Davie's golden boy.

271
00:22:54,008 --> 00:22:56,176
This whole thing hinges on you.

272
00:22:56,243 --> 00:22:57,777
Oh, you don't know how
happy I am right now

273
00:22:57,844 --> 00:22:59,779
to have found you so quickly.

274
00:22:59,846 --> 00:23:01,548
Wait, you've
been looking for me?

275
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,884
I need you to take me to L.A.

276
00:23:04,952 --> 00:23:07,820
I know I can get there
with you driving.

277
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:09,957
Davie's probably gonna try some
messed-up stuff on the way up,

278
00:23:10,024 --> 00:23:12,259
but he can't afford
to lose you.

279
00:23:13,327 --> 00:23:15,429
He won't do anything to you.

280
00:23:15,496 --> 00:23:17,164
Well, okay, hold on.

281
00:23:17,231 --> 00:23:19,099
You're gonna have to
start from the beginning.

282
00:23:20,934 --> 00:23:22,069
What is this all about?

283
00:23:23,971 --> 00:23:25,606
These...

284
00:23:25,673 --> 00:23:27,374
I took them from his safe.

285
00:23:34,615 --> 00:23:36,250
Oh!

286
00:23:46,393 --> 00:23:47,428
Oh, no...

287
00:23:47,494 --> 00:23:49,363
No, no, no, no.

288
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,031
Fuck.

289
00:23:57,971 --> 00:24:00,574
Fuck!

290
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:41,515
Yeah?

291
00:24:41,582 --> 00:24:42,916
Davie?

292
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:44,718
Davie, they took them.
They're gone.

293
00:24:44,785 --> 00:24:46,487
Are you fucking serious?

294
00:24:46,553 --> 00:24:50,124
Yeah, but I tried to stop him,
but he was too fast, and I...

295
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,992
I'm really sorry!

296
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:54,395
Look, you stupid bitch, you'd
better fucking find it, right?

297
00:24:54,461 --> 00:24:56,363
- I fucked up, I know I...
- Now!

298
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:58,198
I don't know what to do,
I'm sorry.

299
00:24:58,265 --> 00:25:00,567
Stupid fucking bitch!

300
00:25:00,634 --> 00:25:02,536
God-fucking-damn it!

301
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:06,340
Who the hell is that?

302
00:25:09,643 --> 00:25:10,778
Bianca.

303
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:12,212
Wait, you know this chick?

304
00:25:21,755 --> 00:25:22,756
So, we there yet?

305
00:25:22,823 --> 00:25:24,258
Not even close.

306
00:25:24,324 --> 00:25:25,959
We're about an hour
out of Suaqui Grande,

307
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:27,761
which, now that I think about
it, is probably a good place

308
00:25:27,828 --> 00:25:30,197
for me to drop you off at
a bus station or somewhere.

309
00:25:30,264 --> 00:25:33,634
What? No, you can't!
Please...

310
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,235
Listen to me, I'm gonna
drop you off

311
00:25:35,302 --> 00:25:37,037
at a bus or train station.

312
00:25:37,104 --> 00:25:38,639
You'll be safer and you'll
get to where you're going

313
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:40,507
a lot quicker and easier
than with me, all right?

314
00:25:40,574 --> 00:25:42,676
He's looking for me at the bus
station, and the airport.

315
00:25:42,743 --> 00:25:44,745
His men are everywhere,
he's gonna kill me!

316
00:25:44,812 --> 00:25:45,946
Don't you understand that?

317
00:25:47,347 --> 00:25:49,750
Because of what's
on those drives?

318
00:25:49,817 --> 00:25:51,018
What's on 'em?

319
00:25:51,084 --> 00:25:52,921
- Evidence.
- Evidence of what?

320
00:25:52,986 --> 00:25:56,256
Of all of Davie's past,
present, and future crimes.

321
00:25:56,323 --> 00:25:58,025
Evidence that's gonna
get that bastard

322
00:25:58,091 --> 00:26:00,427
out of our lives for good, and
put him away where he belongs.

323
00:26:00,494 --> 00:26:02,796
Listen, what exactly
are on those drives?

324
00:26:02,863 --> 00:26:04,631
All of his ledgers...

325
00:26:04,698 --> 00:26:06,300
every record he's kept,

326
00:26:06,366 --> 00:26:09,102
dating back since he started
keeping them digitally.

327
00:26:10,671 --> 00:26:11,605
Oh, boy.

328
00:26:11,672 --> 00:26:13,373
Did they get anything?

329
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,842
As a matter of fact, they did.

330
00:26:14,909 --> 00:26:16,243
Was it anything important?

331
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:19,446
Shut the fuck up, Nelson.

332
00:26:19,513 --> 00:26:20,949
They arrived
at the checkpoint,

333
00:26:21,014 --> 00:26:23,717
the safe was broken into.

334
00:26:23,784 --> 00:26:25,552
Hey...

335
00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:28,021
you know why you're a
worthless, piece of shit loser?

336
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:29,389
Because you never
win at anything.

337
00:26:31,391 --> 00:26:33,160
Sit down when
I'm talking to you!

338
00:26:40,634 --> 00:26:42,904
You can call it luck;

339
00:26:42,971 --> 00:26:45,639
I call it karma.

340
00:26:45,706 --> 00:26:48,408
You come from shit,
all you can be is shit.

341
00:26:48,475 --> 00:26:52,446
But when you give a shit,
you get shit.

342
00:26:53,881 --> 00:26:57,518
My father was nothing,

343
00:26:57,584 --> 00:26:59,853
but look at me.

344
00:26:59,921 --> 00:27:02,556
Now I'm a multimillionaire

345
00:27:02,623 --> 00:27:06,260
who can kill anybody
at any time.

346
00:27:07,361 --> 00:27:10,999
I own this town, I own the cops,

347
00:27:11,064 --> 00:27:12,466
I own everything
you fucking see.

348
00:27:12,533 --> 00:27:14,701
Man, you don't own the cops.

349
00:27:14,768 --> 00:27:16,270
If they knew you were
cutting them out of the race,

350
00:27:16,336 --> 00:27:18,071
you'd be fucked.

351
00:27:20,407 --> 00:27:23,176
Your brother,
he's a piece of shit

352
00:27:23,243 --> 00:27:26,079
because you share
the same fucking blood.

353
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:30,317
Your father was a piece
of shit.

354
00:27:31,618 --> 00:27:33,453
And well...

355
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:38,292
Your mother was a stupid bitch
for fucking a piece of shit.

356
00:27:39,326 --> 00:27:41,228
Look at you...

357
00:27:41,295 --> 00:27:44,032
the way you dress,
the way that...

358
00:27:44,097 --> 00:27:47,801
everything about you says shit.

359
00:27:49,436 --> 00:27:51,238
You'll always be
a fucking loser.

360
00:27:54,241 --> 00:27:55,809
I'm not here by choice.

361
00:27:55,876 --> 00:27:58,645
No one who does anything
for Davie is by choice.

362
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,815
Once they have their hooks in,

363
00:28:01,882 --> 00:28:03,784
you can't get out,
no matter what you do.

364
00:28:06,787 --> 00:28:09,023
Sounds like you're
talking from experience.

365
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:12,859
You know, you don't look much
like a thief or a safe-cracker.

366
00:28:12,927 --> 00:28:14,394
So tell me something...

367
00:28:14,461 --> 00:28:16,330
how'd you know where
the drives were?

368
00:28:16,396 --> 00:28:18,799
I used to work for Davie.

369
00:28:18,865 --> 00:28:20,367
I was his girlfriend.

370
00:28:20,434 --> 00:28:22,302
I knew the safe code.

371
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:25,606
Ah... girlfriend.

372
00:28:25,672 --> 00:28:28,475
Now, that's just
fan-fucking-tastic.

373
00:28:28,542 --> 00:28:30,011
Oh, boy...

374
00:28:30,078 --> 00:28:32,746
let me guess, you broke up
with him, he wanted you back,

375
00:28:32,813 --> 00:28:35,049
you stole the drives, and now
everything's up in the air.

376
00:28:35,115 --> 00:28:36,617
Davie's gonna kill me

377
00:28:36,683 --> 00:28:38,452
if I don't deliver those
drives to Los Angeles.

378
00:28:38,518 --> 00:28:41,722
He could kill anybody
without a thought.

379
00:28:43,156 --> 00:28:44,858
I could never kill anybody...

380
00:28:44,926 --> 00:28:46,928
couldn't even think about that.

381
00:28:46,995 --> 00:28:48,528
You ever kill anybody, huh?

382
00:28:51,365 --> 00:28:52,733
I didn't think so.

383
00:28:54,668 --> 00:28:56,004
He's sick.

384
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,838
This is payback.

385
00:28:57,905 --> 00:28:59,773
And look, whatever
Davie has on you,

386
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,643
whatever reason he has for
forcing you to race for him,

387
00:29:02,709 --> 00:29:05,013
it all goes away once
I get this evidence

388
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:06,480
to the U.S. attorney.

389
00:29:06,546 --> 00:29:11,151
We can put Davie away
for good, you and me.

390
00:29:11,218 --> 00:29:12,586
We can do this.

391
00:29:13,955 --> 00:29:16,156
No one else will do it, Jack.

392
00:29:24,831 --> 00:29:27,101
I underestimated
this little bitch.

393
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:29,436
She chose Jack because
she knows I need him to win.

394
00:29:30,404 --> 00:29:32,305
I don't understand.

395
00:29:32,372 --> 00:29:33,607
She's trying to get
over the border

396
00:29:33,674 --> 00:29:35,542
with the things
she stole from me.

397
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:37,310
She thinks Jack is her ticket.

398
00:29:37,377 --> 00:29:38,812
She's so fucking wrong.

399
00:29:39,981 --> 00:29:41,715
What did this chick
steal from you?

400
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:42,984
Shut the fuck up.

401
00:29:43,051 --> 00:29:45,318
Policia!

402
00:29:48,122 --> 00:29:49,823
I'll take care of this.

403
00:29:57,531 --> 00:29:58,933
The fuck do you want,

404
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,600
banging on my door like
the fucking police?

405
00:30:00,667 --> 00:30:03,137
Senor Davie...

406
00:30:10,978 --> 00:30:12,479
Vamanos!

407
00:30:15,215 --> 00:30:17,217
Vamos!

408
00:30:18,385 --> 00:30:19,519
Motherfuckers!

409
00:30:19,586 --> 00:30:21,788
- Yeah...
- You done fucked up!

410
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,891
Your whole family's gonna
die behind this shit!

411
00:30:33,101 --> 00:30:35,302
- David!
- Gillian!

412
00:30:41,441 --> 00:30:42,576
Damn it!

413
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:49,951
Did they just arrest Davie?

414
00:30:50,017 --> 00:30:52,220
Those sons-of-bitches aren't
taking him to any jail.

415
00:30:52,285 --> 00:30:54,488
Bastards!

416
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:00,494
They pick today to do this,
of all days.

417
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,830
It's their mistake, their error.

418
00:31:03,897 --> 00:31:05,499
And this stays quiet.

419
00:31:05,565 --> 00:31:08,835
As far as anybody knows,
Davie is still right here.

420
00:31:19,147 --> 00:31:20,280
Oh, it's Gillian.

421
00:31:21,149 --> 00:31:23,184
Gillian, what up?

422
00:31:23,251 --> 00:31:26,254
Garcia took Davie.
I need you to bring him back.

423
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:27,687
All right, understood.

424
00:31:27,754 --> 00:31:29,190
I'm sending the car, be ready.

425
00:31:29,257 --> 00:31:30,624
We're ready, we're ready.

426
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,459
- What's up?
- La policia took Davie.

427
00:31:32,526 --> 00:31:33,995
Let's go.

428
00:31:37,231 --> 00:31:39,066
Fuck!

429
00:31:39,133 --> 00:31:40,433
Get ready to fuck some shit up.

430
00:32:24,511 --> 00:32:26,948
Here we go.

431
00:32:27,014 --> 00:32:28,615
All right.

432
00:32:31,685 --> 00:32:33,120
Come on, come on, come on.

433
00:32:42,096 --> 00:32:43,363
Mick, you ass!

434
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:48,936
Woo!

435
00:32:49,003 --> 00:32:51,471
Just a little bumpin', dumplin'!

436
00:32:58,812 --> 00:33:00,948
Not in this lifetime, Nita!

437
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:03,717
Woo!

438
00:33:23,137 --> 00:33:24,471
Shit!

439
00:33:31,245 --> 00:33:32,479
Thank you, Jack!

440
00:33:32,545 --> 00:33:34,681
Motherfucking fuck, fuck!

441
00:33:35,917 --> 00:33:38,451
How do you like that,
you little snotty prick?

442
00:33:38,518 --> 00:33:40,620
Jesus, did you just hit
that guy on purpose?

443
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:43,523
Now we're on track.
That's how we do it.

444
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,672
Are we really going
118 miles per hour?

445
00:33:58,738 --> 00:33:59,839
Yeah, that's the point
of racing...

446
00:33:59,907 --> 00:34:01,675
to go really, really fast.

447
00:34:01,741 --> 00:34:03,077
Well, if you're trying
to scare the crap outta me,

448
00:34:03,144 --> 00:34:04,178
it's working.

449
00:34:18,025 --> 00:34:21,429
Hola.
Dos tacos, por favor.

450
00:34:21,494 --> 00:34:24,298
Très tacos y una cerveza.

451
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,600
Que?

452
00:34:27,667 --> 00:34:29,103
Those tacos aren't
coming, sweetie.

453
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:30,804
You're gonna take us to him
if you wanna

454
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,039
keep your fucking head,
do you understand me?

455
00:34:32,106 --> 00:34:33,573
Let's go.

456
00:35:00,401 --> 00:35:02,736
Why are we stopping?

457
00:35:02,802 --> 00:35:04,372
Because I need
something to eat.

458
00:35:04,438 --> 00:35:05,940
You should do the same.

459
00:35:11,711 --> 00:35:13,214
We'll take it to go.

460
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,316
We gotta make that next
checkpoint by morning.

461
00:35:15,383 --> 00:35:16,951
How many stops we have
until we get to L.A.?

462
00:35:17,018 --> 00:35:18,885
Two more checkpoints
to the finish line.

463
00:35:18,953 --> 00:35:24,624
Hola, I will have the cemita
milanesa y una Coca-Cola.

464
00:35:24,691 --> 00:35:26,793
Huevos rancheros,
salsa picante.

465
00:35:28,661 --> 00:35:30,663
Breakfast for dinner
kinda gal, huh?

466
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:32,166
Since I was a little girl.

467
00:35:32,233 --> 00:35:34,035
But when you grew up
poor like we were,

468
00:35:34,101 --> 00:35:36,404
the concept of breakfast for
dinner goes out the window.

469
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:39,206
You either eat what's in
front of you, or you go hungry.

470
00:35:40,508 --> 00:35:42,709
Fair enough.

471
00:35:42,776 --> 00:35:44,744
Plus I just really like
huevos rancheros.

472
00:35:44,811 --> 00:35:46,579
And you think that's
the best thing to take

473
00:35:46,646 --> 00:35:48,482
in a car on the go?

474
00:35:48,548 --> 00:35:50,784
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
get any yolk or salsa

475
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:52,585
on your precious little car.

476
00:35:52,652 --> 00:35:54,288
Okay, so listen...

477
00:35:54,355 --> 00:35:57,058
let's say your whole plan
works when you get to L.A.

478
00:35:57,124 --> 00:35:59,427
You said Davie has
people everywhere.

479
00:35:59,493 --> 00:36:01,262
What makes you think
he's not gonna come after you

480
00:36:01,328 --> 00:36:02,862
after he goes down?

481
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:04,898
The U.S. attorney's giving
me a new identity.

482
00:36:05,765 --> 00:36:07,201
Witness protection?

483
00:36:09,602 --> 00:36:12,473
And everything you have leads
the feds to his front door?

484
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,241
Yes.

485
00:36:14,308 --> 00:36:16,876
So you can stop trying to dump
me on the side of the road.

486
00:36:16,944 --> 00:36:18,745
So that's what you meant
when you said

487
00:36:18,812 --> 00:36:20,381
everything hinges on me.

488
00:36:20,448 --> 00:36:24,118
Oh, yeah... you're very
important to both of us.

489
00:36:24,185 --> 00:36:27,354
I need you to help me get
this information to L.A.

490
00:36:27,421 --> 00:36:30,157
He needs you to win to keep
the criminals and cartels

491
00:36:30,224 --> 00:36:33,394
he works for happy and earning
millions of commissions.

492
00:36:33,461 --> 00:36:35,029
He won't go after you.

493
00:36:41,102 --> 00:36:42,802
I gotta run to the bathroom.
I'll meet you at the car.

494
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:44,604
Yeah, hurry up.
We gotta go.

495
00:37:08,895 --> 00:37:12,433
Hola, mija.
We're gonna have some fun!

496
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,800
Ah!

497
00:37:13,867 --> 00:37:15,035
Gimme the drives!

498
00:37:18,606 --> 00:37:20,740
I know that you have them!

499
00:37:28,848 --> 00:37:31,152
How about this?

500
00:37:31,218 --> 00:37:32,752
No! No!

501
00:37:40,427 --> 00:37:41,661
Ah!

502
00:37:45,865 --> 00:37:47,268
[ shouting

503
00:37:58,312 --> 00:37:59,846
Thanks for the drive,
you son of a bitch.

504
00:37:59,914 --> 00:38:01,949
Puta bitch!

505
00:38:09,689 --> 00:38:10,857
Jack, we gotta go!

506
00:38:10,925 --> 00:38:11,992
Bianca, what the hell...

507
00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:14,295
Get in the fucking car!

508
00:38:29,143 --> 00:38:31,078
You okay?
Is anything broken?

509
00:38:31,145 --> 00:38:33,080
I don't think so.

510
00:38:33,147 --> 00:38:34,881
Oh, man.

511
00:38:34,949 --> 00:38:38,785
He was looking
for the thumb drives... these.

512
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:42,755
Here, put this on your lip,
it'll help with the swelling.

513
00:38:42,822 --> 00:38:44,325
Thanks.

514
00:38:44,391 --> 00:38:45,758
Ow!

515
00:38:47,394 --> 00:38:49,630
Son of a bitch had his
knee digging into my back,

516
00:38:49,697 --> 00:38:51,265
I thought he was gonna break it.

517
00:38:53,901 --> 00:38:55,569
I'll be fine.

518
00:38:55,636 --> 00:38:57,705
It's nothing compared to what
Davie used to do to me.

519
00:39:04,078 --> 00:39:06,113
It's not my car,
it's your boyfriend's.

520
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,482
What the hell did I say
about saying that, Jack?

521
00:39:10,883 --> 00:39:12,819
What are you doing?

522
00:39:12,885 --> 00:39:16,123
How did he know
you were here, huh?

523
00:39:21,996 --> 00:39:23,796
He can see in the car?

524
00:39:25,232 --> 00:39:26,367
Gotcha.

525
00:39:27,735 --> 00:39:29,603
Damn it!

526
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,005
I think he got you.

527
00:39:39,779 --> 00:39:43,917
We have... a complication.

528
00:39:47,721 --> 00:39:48,922
Let's go, puto.

529
00:39:52,792 --> 00:39:54,128
Get the fuck over there.

530
00:39:55,862 --> 00:39:58,865
Por favor, no!
Por favor!

531
00:39:58,932 --> 00:40:00,534
- Por favor!
- Shut up.

532
00:40:05,805 --> 00:40:08,875
Thanks for the directions, papi.

533
00:40:11,512 --> 00:40:14,715
Get down!
I said, get down, now!

534
00:40:18,185 --> 00:40:19,852
Come on, Davie...
can you walk?

535
00:40:21,155 --> 00:40:23,290
Okay, you're almost there.

536
00:40:23,357 --> 00:40:25,492
Fucking pig!

537
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:27,127
Motherfucker.

538
00:40:29,697 --> 00:40:31,165
I gotcha.

539
00:40:32,865 --> 00:40:34,134
They must have drugged him.

540
00:40:34,201 --> 00:40:35,835
Take his hood off.

541
00:40:49,249 --> 00:40:50,883
Move!

542
00:41:02,029 --> 00:41:03,797
Tanya, did you find him yet?

543
00:41:03,863 --> 00:41:04,864
Yeah, yeah, we got him,
we got him.

544
00:41:04,932 --> 00:41:06,500
How bad did they hurt him?

545
00:41:06,567 --> 00:41:08,502
No, I don't...
I don't fucking know, Gillian.

546
00:41:08,569 --> 00:41:12,872
You call me as soon as he's
able to talk to me, you hear me?

547
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,942
I want you to meet me in L.A.

548
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,543
- L.A.?
- Get to the air strip.

549
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:17,845
The jet's waiting.

550
00:41:17,911 --> 00:41:20,114
Drive as fast as you can,
you got it?

551
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:22,282
I cannot risk anything
else happening to him.

552
00:41:22,349 --> 00:41:24,884
- Faster, faster.
- I can't go any fucking faster!

553
00:41:27,521 --> 00:41:28,522
Fuck!

554
00:41:49,143 --> 00:41:51,145
You don't belong here.

555
00:42:06,827 --> 00:42:08,128
Mm.

556
00:42:11,131 --> 00:42:13,000
Morning.

557
00:42:13,066 --> 00:42:14,802
Yeah.

558
00:42:14,868 --> 00:42:16,270
Did you get some sleep?

559
00:42:17,971 --> 00:42:19,673
A bit.

560
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:23,043
I stopped for a couple hours
when my eyes got heavy.

561
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:24,445
Good.

562
00:42:24,511 --> 00:42:26,113
How far are we from
the next checkpoint?

563
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,381
I gotta pee.

564
00:42:27,448 --> 00:42:29,583
Close.

565
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:31,920
I just hope it's a place
where there's coffee.

566
00:42:42,763 --> 00:42:44,198
What is this?

567
00:42:57,878 --> 00:42:59,480
The Sinaloa.

568
00:42:59,546 --> 00:43:01,248
Cartel.

569
00:43:01,315 --> 00:43:03,884
Davie moves a lot
of money for them.

570
00:43:03,952 --> 00:43:05,385
I want the girl!

571
00:43:07,721 --> 00:43:10,257
Send her out, and you go.

572
00:43:12,693 --> 00:43:14,528
Jack, please.

573
00:43:17,231 --> 00:43:20,334
Send out that puta, esse!

574
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,403
- Bianca...
- Send out that bitch!

575
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:25,172
Get out.

576
00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:27,841
Jack, no... please.

577
00:43:27,909 --> 00:43:29,510
I said get out, now!

578
00:43:29,576 --> 00:43:31,011
They're gonna murder me,
you know that, right?

579
00:43:31,078 --> 00:43:32,713
- Now!
- Get out, now!

580
00:43:32,779 --> 00:43:35,582
My blood is gonna be on your
hands, you son of a bitch.

581
00:43:41,121 --> 00:43:43,690
Now!

582
00:43:45,058 --> 00:43:49,029
Go get her! Go!

583
00:44:19,027 --> 00:44:20,394
Get in, get in!

584
00:44:21,963 --> 00:44:23,196
Jesus!

585
00:44:25,732 --> 00:44:27,401
Motherfucker!

586
00:44:31,438 --> 00:44:32,739
Fuck!

587
00:44:35,409 --> 00:44:37,344
You couldn't warn me first?

588
00:44:50,925 --> 00:44:54,528
Woo... 2.6 miles to go!

589
00:44:54,595 --> 00:44:56,296
You better believe
I'm taking this one.

590
00:44:56,363 --> 00:44:57,664
Fuck you, Jack!

591
00:44:59,033 --> 00:45:03,503
Jack better be fixing to reach
this checkpoint, Nelson.

592
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:08,042
If he loses a stage,
there's no good news for you.

593
00:45:08,108 --> 00:45:11,111
Don't threaten me, Gillian.

594
00:45:11,178 --> 00:45:13,347
"Don't threaten me, Gillian?"

595
00:45:15,749 --> 00:45:19,720
You know, for an old military
grunt, you're a real pussy.

596
00:45:19,786 --> 00:45:22,090
"Don't threaten me, Gillian."

597
00:45:22,155 --> 00:45:24,725
Okay.

598
00:45:24,791 --> 00:45:27,327
Mick is about
to win this stage,

599
00:45:27,394 --> 00:45:29,896
and now you're going
to grow a pair with me?

600
00:45:32,934 --> 00:45:35,903
If I were Jack,
I'd have turned my back

601
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:38,305
on your pathetic ass years ago.

602
00:45:39,206 --> 00:45:41,675
Now look where you got him...

603
00:45:41,742 --> 00:45:45,178
out there on the road because
you're a low-life degenerate

604
00:45:45,245 --> 00:45:48,116
with a gambling problem.

605
00:45:48,181 --> 00:45:52,586
Got a lot of balls for somebody
who owes us seven figures.

606
00:45:53,988 --> 00:45:55,589
What are you gonna do?

607
00:45:56,991 --> 00:45:58,926
I mean, you gonna kill me?

608
00:45:58,993 --> 00:46:01,194
How's that get you paid?

609
00:46:01,261 --> 00:46:04,264
That gets us paid.

610
00:46:04,331 --> 00:46:06,533
Jack gets us paid.

611
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,803
If he loses, so do you.

612
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:13,874
If we have to pay out,
we're not the only ones

613
00:46:13,941 --> 00:46:16,176
who are going to feel it.

614
00:46:16,243 --> 00:46:20,948
Killing you is
a consolation prize,

615
00:46:21,015 --> 00:46:25,485
and we'd be doing everybody
around you a goddamn favor.

616
00:46:45,472 --> 00:46:48,275
Jack, what are you doing?

617
00:46:48,341 --> 00:46:49,743
Get back in the car!

618
00:46:50,844 --> 00:46:52,980
Why are we stopping?

619
00:46:56,084 --> 00:46:58,218
Jack!

620
00:46:58,285 --> 00:46:59,319
- Bianca, please...
- Jack!

621
00:46:59,386 --> 00:47:00,988
Please, stop.

622
00:47:01,055 --> 00:47:03,523
Gimme a fucking second,
I've gotta check for damage.

623
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:06,060
And relax, they're not
after us anymore.

624
00:47:08,996 --> 00:47:11,065
You saved my ass back there.

625
00:47:11,132 --> 00:47:14,035
No one's ever done anything
like that for me before.

626
00:47:14,102 --> 00:47:15,970
I'm sorry I didn't
warn you sooner.

627
00:47:16,037 --> 00:47:17,571
I figured the only way
they were gonna buy it

628
00:47:17,637 --> 00:47:19,740
is if you thought
I was giving you up.

629
00:47:19,806 --> 00:47:22,210
I sure as hell thought
you were gonna give me up.

630
00:47:22,275 --> 00:47:25,879
And then you mowed him down.

631
00:47:40,128 --> 00:47:41,361
Thank you.

632
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:44,498
Sure.

633
00:47:48,335 --> 00:47:50,604
You know, come to think of it,

634
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:53,774
Davie said all of
the GPS systems

635
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:56,911
were preprogrammed with the
destinations of the checkpoints.

636
00:48:00,814 --> 00:48:02,616
That's how he's
been tracking us.

637
00:48:04,018 --> 00:48:05,719
That's how he led us
into that ambush.

638
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:10,824
Now what?

639
00:48:10,891 --> 00:48:12,359
We don't know where the next
checkpoints are located.

640
00:48:12,425 --> 00:48:15,229
I have an idea.

641
00:48:15,295 --> 00:48:16,563
Do you have Instagram?

642
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:19,233
- Yeah.
- I figured.

643
00:48:19,299 --> 00:48:22,502
Uh, look up Six-Speed Nina.

644
00:48:22,569 --> 00:48:24,805
If I recall correctly,
she said something about

645
00:48:24,871 --> 00:48:27,909
Puerto Poco or Puerto Puntasca
or something like that.

646
00:48:27,975 --> 00:48:29,177
I got it...

647
00:48:29,243 --> 00:48:30,278
Puerto Penasco?

648
00:48:30,343 --> 00:48:32,746
Yeah, yeah, that sounds right.

649
00:48:32,813 --> 00:48:34,881
Got it.

650
00:48:34,949 --> 00:48:37,684
Hola, race fans, it's your
girl, Six-Speed Nina, and

651
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:41,956
I am here at
El Tesoro Escondido,

652
00:48:42,023 --> 00:48:46,928
in the town of Hermosio, our
first stop in the Outlaw 1000.

653
00:48:46,994 --> 00:48:48,829
And you'd better believe
I'll be chowing down

654
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:53,333
on some bean burritos before the
race moves to Puerto Penasco.

655
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,236
I knew she wouldn't
let us down.

656
00:48:55,303 --> 00:48:56,469
All right, come on, let's go.

657
00:49:05,412 --> 00:49:07,714
Woo!

658
00:49:07,781 --> 00:49:10,650
Where's everybody at?

659
00:49:10,717 --> 00:49:12,853
Did I win this
motherfucking round?

660
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:15,655
I think I did.

661
00:49:18,192 --> 00:49:19,693
Whew.

662
00:49:22,562 --> 00:49:25,299
Hey, yo, I'm here.

663
00:49:25,365 --> 00:49:28,401
So? And you are?

664
00:49:28,468 --> 00:49:30,071
Mick Hammett.

665
00:49:30,137 --> 00:49:32,739
And it looks like I'm the first
motherfucker to show up.

666
00:49:32,806 --> 00:49:35,009
Well,
congratu-fucking-lations.

667
00:49:37,444 --> 00:49:39,713
Are you sure it's
safe to check in?

668
00:49:39,779 --> 00:49:41,182
Davie won't risk
doing anything to us

669
00:49:41,249 --> 00:49:43,084
in front of the other drivers.

670
00:49:44,352 --> 00:49:46,187
What do you want
from me, dude?

671
00:49:46,254 --> 00:49:47,854
Don't you got somebody
you gotta call or something?

672
00:49:51,892 --> 00:49:55,263
I want you to call who
you're supposed to call.

673
00:49:55,329 --> 00:49:57,397
- Uh, perdona me...
- Yes?

674
00:49:57,464 --> 00:49:59,000
Jack Tyson, checking
in for the Outlaw?

675
00:49:59,066 --> 00:50:01,768
Welcome, Mr. Tyson.
You're the stage winner.

676
00:50:01,835 --> 00:50:02,970
I am?

677
00:50:03,037 --> 00:50:04,171
Whoa, whoa, no,
the fuck he's not.

678
00:50:04,238 --> 00:50:05,772
I was here before he was!

679
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:07,674
You were just talking to me
before he pulled up!

680
00:50:07,741 --> 00:50:09,343
Man, I don't know who you are

681
00:50:09,409 --> 00:50:11,212
or what the fuck
you want from me,

682
00:50:11,279 --> 00:50:14,115
but you just come in here
talking about "I've arrived."

683
00:50:14,181 --> 00:50:16,017
Look, man, he's right.
He won fair and square.

684
00:50:16,083 --> 00:50:17,884
I was here before he got here,
you were just...

685
00:50:17,952 --> 00:50:20,988
Man, back the fuck up, dude,
right now, all right?

686
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:22,223
You got five seconds.

687
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:23,623
That's right, man.

688
00:50:25,659 --> 00:50:28,628
Yeah... keep walking, man.

689
00:50:37,071 --> 00:50:39,140
Hello?
Yeah, this is Robert.

690
00:50:39,206 --> 00:50:40,308
Got your first winner.

691
00:50:40,374 --> 00:50:41,775
Mr. Tyson.

692
00:50:41,841 --> 00:50:43,443
That's some major bullshit.

693
00:50:45,879 --> 00:50:48,316
Well?

694
00:50:48,382 --> 00:50:50,217
He did it...
two more to go.

695
00:50:56,924 --> 00:50:59,526
Wait...

696
00:50:59,592 --> 00:51:01,895
That's why Davie
gave me the 100k?

697
00:51:04,031 --> 00:51:05,366
What?

698
00:51:05,433 --> 00:51:06,666
Yeah, you needed
some action on Jack

699
00:51:06,733 --> 00:51:08,802
so that no one
asked any questions.

700
00:51:08,868 --> 00:51:11,005
You need this to look legit.

701
00:51:12,672 --> 00:51:14,641
I don't follow.

702
00:51:14,708 --> 00:51:18,946
You know, I might look
like a brain-dead meathead,

703
00:51:19,013 --> 00:51:23,117
but even a kid
really could figure this out.

704
00:51:24,352 --> 00:51:26,786
Yeah, the bettors,
they aren't taking Jack

705
00:51:26,853 --> 00:51:29,823
because they're
losing on purpose.

706
00:51:29,889 --> 00:51:34,195
Yeah... you and Davie
retain the cash

707
00:51:34,261 --> 00:51:37,831
that they lose on the bet at
a commission, and then what?

708
00:51:39,666 --> 00:51:42,869
My guess is you're
supposed to spend it,

709
00:51:42,937 --> 00:51:45,906
or move it to where
they tell you to.

710
00:51:47,741 --> 00:51:50,677
In the end, no one loses
a dime on the wager,

711
00:51:50,744 --> 00:51:55,483
and you make, what,
18 million on stage two?

712
00:51:55,548 --> 00:51:59,086
This is money-laundering.

713
00:51:59,153 --> 00:52:01,022
Yeah.

714
00:52:01,088 --> 00:52:03,257
This whole thing
is just a front.

715
00:52:30,217 --> 00:52:32,319
You figure that out
by yourself?

716
00:52:34,321 --> 00:52:35,622
How about that?

717
00:52:40,727 --> 00:52:44,631
You know, at the end
of the day,

718
00:52:44,697 --> 00:52:47,867
you and Davie are just

719
00:52:47,935 --> 00:52:51,138
two lowlife degenerates
like me.

720
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:55,009
I am nothing like you.

721
00:52:55,076 --> 00:53:00,214
I am a businesswoman,
earning a living...

722
00:53:00,281 --> 00:53:04,584
a rather lucrative one,
I might add.

723
00:53:08,655 --> 00:53:10,224
Until Jack gets to L.A.

724
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:24,038
Well, it looks like
you're gonna have to wait

725
00:53:24,105 --> 00:53:25,940
a little longer
before that cup of coffee.

726
00:53:26,006 --> 00:53:28,375
So, you won, right?

727
00:53:30,677 --> 00:53:32,779
Well, as you can see,
there was a little controversy,

728
00:53:32,846 --> 00:53:35,015
but yeah, I guess
we took the stage.

729
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:37,884
"We?"

730
00:53:37,952 --> 00:53:40,787
You're in the car, too...

731
00:53:40,854 --> 00:53:42,056
whether I like it or not.

732
00:53:44,291 --> 00:53:45,725
So which is it?

733
00:53:48,661 --> 00:53:49,997
Still deciding.

734
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,903
Should we let the others
know what we found in the car?

735
00:53:55,970 --> 00:53:57,704
They have every right
to their privacy.

736
00:53:59,672 --> 00:54:01,741
Hey, yo, Six.

737
00:54:02,842 --> 00:54:05,246
Mr. World Champ.

738
00:54:05,312 --> 00:54:07,148
Hey, I wanna thank you
for yesterday.

739
00:54:07,214 --> 00:54:09,649
You know, helping me out
back there when Mick

740
00:54:09,716 --> 00:54:11,085
was trying to run
me off the road.

741
00:54:11,152 --> 00:54:12,153
No problem.

742
00:54:12,219 --> 00:54:14,754
Let's just say he had it coming.

743
00:54:14,821 --> 00:54:16,390
Yeah, okay.

744
00:54:16,457 --> 00:54:18,926
Well, I'll tell you,
he was super pissed.

745
00:54:18,993 --> 00:54:21,362
Then after what happened
in the station...

746
00:54:21,428 --> 00:54:23,097
I'd watch your back.

747
00:54:23,164 --> 00:54:25,466
He's stupid, but I don't
think he has it in him.

748
00:54:25,533 --> 00:54:28,068
Heh... yeah.

749
00:54:28,135 --> 00:54:29,470
Well, I just wanted
to give you a head's up

750
00:54:29,537 --> 00:54:30,737
on what's going down.

751
00:54:30,803 --> 00:54:32,072
- Well, I appreciate that.
- Mm-hmm.

752
00:54:32,139 --> 00:54:35,609
- Well, now it's my turn.
- Yeah?

753
00:54:35,675 --> 00:54:37,111
You think you can grab Mick

754
00:54:37,178 --> 00:54:38,811
and meet me back here
in about five minutes?

755
00:54:38,878 --> 00:54:41,315
I gotta tell you guys something.

756
00:54:41,382 --> 00:54:43,083
- Okay.
- See you here in five.

757
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:44,418
Yeah.

758
00:54:47,021 --> 00:54:49,689
You say a fucking word,
and I will kill you.

759
00:55:00,867 --> 00:55:01,834
Who's calling?

760
00:55:01,902 --> 00:55:03,404
Hi, Jack.

761
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:06,373
You don't know me,
so let me introduce myself.

762
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,309
I'm Gillian Bertrand.

763
00:55:08,375 --> 00:55:11,245
I guess "attaboy"
is in order first...

764
00:55:11,312 --> 00:55:12,947
two stages so far.

765
00:55:13,013 --> 00:55:14,982
Gotta hand it to you.

766
00:55:15,049 --> 00:55:17,985
Why are you calling me?
Where's my brother?

767
00:55:18,052 --> 00:55:20,720
Relax, nobody's lying
in a ditch face-down

768
00:55:20,787 --> 00:55:22,489
with the back of
their head blown off.

769
00:55:22,556 --> 00:55:26,527
All right, I'm listening.
What do you want?

770
00:55:26,594 --> 00:55:29,330
The same thing Davie wants.

771
00:55:29,396 --> 00:55:31,932
We got a good thing going,
all of us.

772
00:55:31,999 --> 00:55:34,401
Then why are you
calling me and not him?

773
00:55:34,468 --> 00:55:36,270
I need you to focus, Jack.

774
00:55:36,337 --> 00:55:39,373
Don't let that bitch
screw this up.

775
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,775
She's just another one
of Davie's crazy ex-girlfriends

776
00:55:42,842 --> 00:55:44,877
with an anger
management problem.

777
00:55:47,248 --> 00:55:49,516
If Davie likes making deals,

778
00:55:49,583 --> 00:55:51,784
well, you can tell him
I got one for him.

779
00:55:51,851 --> 00:55:55,990
Bianca for my brother...
even trade.

780
00:55:56,056 --> 00:56:00,427
We never hear from either
one of you again... debt paid.

781
00:56:00,494 --> 00:56:03,063
Are you there?

782
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:04,665
Oh, I'm here, Jack,

783
00:56:04,732 --> 00:56:07,568
and I think I could speak
for him when I say we're

784
00:56:07,635 --> 00:56:09,536
ready to agree to your terms...

785
00:56:09,603 --> 00:56:11,238
even trade.

786
00:56:19,913 --> 00:56:22,983
He's not coming.

787
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:24,218
Oh... his loss.

788
00:56:24,285 --> 00:56:28,222
Listen, we're all being watched.

789
00:56:28,289 --> 00:56:29,822
There's cameras in the car.

790
00:56:29,889 --> 00:56:31,258
Wh... what?

791
00:56:31,325 --> 00:56:32,459
- Yeah, come...
- But how?

792
00:56:32,526 --> 00:56:35,229
Come on.

793
00:56:35,296 --> 00:56:38,732
Look, check the dash and up
above, you should find...

794
00:56:38,798 --> 00:56:40,167
What?

795
00:56:45,838 --> 00:56:48,242
What in the hell?

796
00:56:48,309 --> 00:56:49,576
Yeah.

797
00:56:51,912 --> 00:56:54,415
Wait... how did you know this?

798
00:56:54,481 --> 00:56:58,419
Nina, some things are
better left unanswered.

799
00:56:58,485 --> 00:57:00,887
Do you want some advice?

800
00:57:00,954 --> 00:57:02,456
Get out of the race game,

801
00:57:02,523 --> 00:57:05,192
and you'll avoid guys
like Davie.

802
00:57:05,259 --> 00:57:06,960
One of these days you're
gonna realize it's...

803
00:57:07,027 --> 00:57:10,030
it's not worth the risk anymore.

804
00:57:11,098 --> 00:57:12,832
Jack!
Jack, behind you, watch out!

805
00:57:19,807 --> 00:57:21,775
Mick, stop, let him go!

806
00:57:21,841 --> 00:57:23,644
Yeah, two of them, right now,

807
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:25,878
they're fighting in the
middle of my gas station.

808
00:57:29,683 --> 00:57:30,818
Are we done?

809
00:57:31,884 --> 00:57:33,187
Are we done?

810
00:57:42,529 --> 00:57:44,598
You all right?

811
00:57:44,665 --> 00:57:46,967
- You're hurt.
- Yeah.

812
00:57:47,034 --> 00:57:48,335
Come on, we gotta go.

813
00:58:14,328 --> 00:58:17,231
Here, keep this on there
to stop the bleeding.

814
00:58:22,736 --> 00:58:23,937
What's wrong?

815
00:58:27,174 --> 00:58:30,043
I have a daughter.

816
00:58:30,110 --> 00:58:31,578
She's six years old.

817
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:34,114
Her name is Sophia.

818
00:58:37,751 --> 00:58:40,954
And where is she
while you're here?

819
00:58:41,021 --> 00:58:43,690
Somewhere safe.

820
00:58:43,757 --> 00:58:46,727
I'm not gonna say where,
I never know who's listening.

821
00:58:46,794 --> 00:58:49,630
Does she know how brave
her mother is for doing this?

822
00:58:49,696 --> 00:58:52,232
Every waking moment
should be spent with her,

823
00:58:52,299 --> 00:58:54,903
but she needs me to do this.

824
00:58:54,968 --> 00:58:56,637
The feds are gonna help her.

825
00:58:56,703 --> 00:58:58,105
I give them what they want,

826
00:58:58,172 --> 00:59:00,574
they help me get her
into the United States,

827
00:59:00,641 --> 00:59:02,075
give us new lives,

828
00:59:02,142 --> 00:59:04,077
and give her the medical
procedure that she needs.

829
00:59:10,551 --> 00:59:11,685
Pemex Gas.

830
00:59:11,752 --> 00:59:14,054
Roberto, is there
anybody still there?

831
00:59:14,121 --> 00:59:15,924
Yeah, one of them's
still here...

832
00:59:15,989 --> 00:59:17,791
the one that lost.

833
00:59:17,858 --> 00:59:19,760
Let me talk to him.

834
00:59:19,827 --> 00:59:21,261
All right, hold on.

835
00:59:21,328 --> 00:59:24,598
Yo, loser...
you got a phone call, man.

836
00:59:24,665 --> 00:59:25,999
Hurry the fuck up, dude.

837
00:59:27,936 --> 00:59:29,436
What's up?

838
00:59:29,503 --> 00:59:33,474
Mick?
This is Gillian Bertrand.

839
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:35,944
I heard you two got
into it earlier,

840
00:59:36,009 --> 00:59:38,545
and I see now Jack
has left you behind.

841
00:59:38,612 --> 00:59:40,113
Yeah, I'm gonna
catch up to that motherfucker

842
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:41,181
and make him pay.

843
00:59:41,248 --> 00:59:42,616
See that you do.

844
00:59:42,683 --> 00:59:46,987
And make sure you
win the next stage...

845
00:59:47,054 --> 00:59:49,022
whatever it takes.

846
00:59:49,089 --> 00:59:52,626
My brother and I are moving a
whole lot of money to your ride.

847
00:59:52,693 --> 00:59:54,261
And Mick...

848
00:59:55,662 --> 01:00:00,100
don't make us regret
putting our faith in you.

849
01:00:01,034 --> 01:00:02,870
Consider it done.

850
01:00:02,937 --> 01:00:04,238
Hurry the fuck up.

851
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:09,944
What the fuck you doing, dude?

852
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:11,678
Here's your phone, pussy.

853
01:00:24,525 --> 01:00:26,928
Jack?

854
01:00:26,995 --> 01:00:28,095
We have a problem.

855
01:00:28,161 --> 01:00:29,530
Yeah? What's that?

856
01:00:29,596 --> 01:00:31,832
I don't have a visa
or a permit.

857
01:00:31,899 --> 01:00:34,601
The U.S. attorney's office
didn't send you anything?

858
01:00:34,668 --> 01:00:36,336
I couldn't let them know
I was coming,

859
01:00:36,403 --> 01:00:38,605
I couldn't risk Davie
knowing what I was doing.

860
01:00:38,672 --> 01:00:39,773
Oh, God.

861
01:00:41,174 --> 01:00:42,977
All right, great, so how
do we cross the border?

862
01:00:43,043 --> 01:00:44,411
You got any great ideas?

863
01:00:44,478 --> 01:00:47,147
Yes, but it's very dangerous.

864
01:00:47,214 --> 01:00:48,649
Ah, because of course it is,

865
01:00:48,715 --> 01:00:51,084
and why would it
be any other way?

866
01:00:52,686 --> 01:00:55,455
We need to go back around
where we came from, 20 miles.

867
01:00:55,522 --> 01:00:56,557
Mm.

868
01:01:10,437 --> 01:01:13,106
Wait...
wait, what's happening?

869
01:01:13,173 --> 01:01:15,342
What did you do?

870
01:01:15,409 --> 01:01:16,777
What is your problem?

871
01:01:18,679 --> 01:01:22,349
First you're bitching that no
one's betting on your brother.

872
01:01:22,416 --> 01:01:24,818
Now he's won two stages

873
01:01:24,885 --> 01:01:27,387
and everybody wants a piece
of the action,

874
01:01:27,454 --> 01:01:29,256
and that's no good either?

875
01:01:29,323 --> 01:01:30,524
Make up your mind.

876
01:01:30,591 --> 01:01:31,993
No, you...

877
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:33,928
no, you don't want Jack's
bets to win, all right?

878
01:01:33,995 --> 01:01:35,395
You'd have to pay out big.

879
01:01:35,462 --> 01:01:37,497
Look at the size of these
wagers coming in.

880
01:01:37,564 --> 01:01:40,634
That's more than the commission
you made on the entire race.

881
01:01:42,269 --> 01:01:43,570
This stinks.

882
01:01:44,771 --> 01:01:46,239
What did you do?

883
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:56,350
Gillian...

884
01:01:56,416 --> 01:01:57,784
Gillian...
please, Gillian.

885
01:01:57,851 --> 01:02:00,922
Please, please.

886
01:02:00,989 --> 01:02:02,255
Get out of this office,

887
01:02:02,322 --> 01:02:05,792
before I blow your
fucking head off.

888
01:02:05,859 --> 01:02:07,194
Okay.

889
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:09,896
I'm tired of you.

890
01:02:09,964 --> 01:02:12,165
- Now!
- Okay!

891
01:02:22,043 --> 01:02:23,744
If we die, I'm blaming you.

892
01:02:30,517 --> 01:02:32,619
Is that who I think it is?

893
01:02:32,686 --> 01:02:35,155
There's another car
following us.

894
01:02:35,222 --> 01:02:37,557
Here we go.
Whew.

895
01:02:38,993 --> 01:02:40,827
It's that asshole
from the gas station again.

896
01:02:58,578 --> 01:03:01,481
Ah!

897
01:03:12,459 --> 01:03:14,327
Here's the border,
it's right there!

898
01:03:14,394 --> 01:03:16,530
Can you hit that button
and make us go faster?

899
01:03:16,596 --> 01:03:18,365
Yeah, nitrous in
desert terrain...

900
01:03:18,432 --> 01:03:20,034
recipe for disaster.

901
01:03:20,101 --> 01:03:21,702
Crack the axle, the car is dead.

902
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:28,308
Get him!
Get him, damn it!

903
01:04:01,241 --> 01:04:02,476
Ah!

904
01:04:02,542 --> 01:04:06,279
Mick, you worthless
piece of...

905
01:04:07,347 --> 01:04:10,985
Jack cannot win this stage!

906
01:04:11,052 --> 01:04:13,453
Oh! Oh!

907
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,555
That's a big payout.

908
01:04:17,424 --> 01:04:20,027
"More than you made on
commissions this far."

909
01:04:32,206 --> 01:04:34,041
They're in Arizona.

910
01:04:44,185 --> 01:04:45,953
How's your day going?

911
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:47,420
It's fucked.

912
01:04:47,487 --> 01:04:50,224
So tell me about it...
what's really going on?

913
01:04:50,290 --> 01:04:51,725
Man...

914
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:55,163
man, I've dealt with
some people in my life,

915
01:04:55,229 --> 01:04:58,498
but this bitch, she's
something else, you know?

916
01:04:58,565 --> 01:05:01,668
Ah... a real chinga
tu madre, eh?

917
01:05:01,735 --> 01:05:02,736
Ah, si.

918
01:05:02,803 --> 01:05:04,906
- Hit me.
- All right.

919
01:05:07,208 --> 01:05:09,143
In that case, drink up.

920
01:05:09,210 --> 01:05:10,443
Mm, cheers.

921
01:05:17,350 --> 01:05:18,953
You gonna get that?

922
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:20,687
No fucking way.

923
01:05:24,825 --> 01:05:27,527
I watched you ignore my call.

924
01:05:29,696 --> 01:05:32,099
Seems like a dick move,
don't you think?

925
01:05:32,166 --> 01:05:34,668
Look, Gillian, I'm just
having a drink, okay?

926
01:05:34,734 --> 01:05:37,437
- Get up.
- Come on.

927
01:05:37,504 --> 01:05:39,606
Get up and out!

928
01:05:39,673 --> 01:05:41,175
- All right, all right...
- Now!

929
01:05:41,242 --> 01:05:43,844
You don't have to do this.

930
01:05:43,911 --> 01:05:46,080
- Now, Nelson.
- It is what it is, man.

931
01:05:46,147 --> 01:05:48,216
Welcome to Navojoa.

932
01:05:48,282 --> 01:05:50,952
- Oh...
- Leave it...

933
01:05:51,018 --> 01:05:52,352
Consider it your tip.

934
01:05:52,419 --> 01:05:53,553
- Thank you, boss.
- Move it!

935
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:55,089
What are you doing, Gillian?

936
01:05:55,156 --> 01:05:57,858
It's time to meet up
with your brother.

937
01:05:57,925 --> 01:05:59,793
I hope you're not
afraid of flying.

938
01:06:39,333 --> 01:06:41,035
Jack, you okay?

939
01:06:44,906 --> 01:06:49,409
Jack, help!

940
01:06:49,476 --> 01:06:51,411
Tell me what's going on, Jack.

941
01:06:51,478 --> 01:06:53,480
I don't know.

942
01:06:53,546 --> 01:06:54,881
I'm...

943
01:06:56,883 --> 01:06:58,019
Where am I?

944
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:01,155
Hey, we're okay.

945
01:07:01,222 --> 01:07:02,189
We made it.

946
01:07:02,256 --> 01:07:03,757
We're gonna be fine.

947
01:07:07,494 --> 01:07:08,762
What can I do?

948
01:07:21,008 --> 01:07:23,044
Remember you asked me
if I ever killed anybody?

949
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:27,647
Well, the answer is yes.

950
01:07:29,516 --> 01:07:31,185
What happened?

951
01:07:32,719 --> 01:07:34,121
It was a blind corner.

952
01:07:37,224 --> 01:07:39,526
We both saw it, but I...

953
01:07:39,592 --> 01:07:41,761
I miscalculated, and...

954
01:07:43,663 --> 01:07:45,066
I drove us off the side.

955
01:07:47,534 --> 01:07:49,569
The car landed upside-down,

956
01:07:50,804 --> 01:07:53,174
the fuel tank exploded,

957
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:55,076
and the car burned up
from the outside.

958
01:07:55,142 --> 01:07:56,576
I...

959
01:07:59,479 --> 01:08:01,548
I made it out,
but my wife, she...

960
01:08:05,319 --> 01:08:06,253
she got trapped.

961
01:08:07,455 --> 01:08:08,755
It's not your fault.

962
01:08:11,325 --> 01:08:13,260
Growing up, it was
just me and my brother.

963
01:08:15,363 --> 01:08:17,999
But he got screwed up
in the war, you know, PTSD.

964
01:08:19,967 --> 01:08:22,970
All I had was my skin, my car,
and the streets.

965
01:08:24,771 --> 01:08:28,575
You know, I had this '74 Camaro,

966
01:08:28,641 --> 01:08:29,843
ran like a beast.

967
01:08:31,312 --> 01:08:33,646
It was an eight-second car.

968
01:08:33,713 --> 01:08:36,150
I lived my life a quarter
of a mile at a time.

969
01:08:38,986 --> 01:08:41,188
You know, they say you're
only as good as your last race,

970
01:08:41,255 --> 01:08:44,624
and when my wife died,
I was done.

971
01:08:45,825 --> 01:08:47,294
I'm so sorry, Jack.

972
01:08:49,596 --> 01:08:51,731
It's funny,
because growing up,

973
01:08:51,798 --> 01:08:54,801
all I wanted to do is
be the best, the fastest.

974
01:08:54,868 --> 01:08:56,270
Some people would say I was.

975
01:08:58,406 --> 01:08:59,974
But I never felt that way.

976
01:09:02,410 --> 01:09:05,312
When my foot hits that pedal
and I hit top gear...

977
01:09:06,679 --> 01:09:07,814
I feel free.

978
01:09:09,216 --> 01:09:11,185
There's no better
feeling in the world.

979
01:09:12,752 --> 01:09:14,687
See all the cars behind me,

980
01:09:16,556 --> 01:09:18,225
look in front of me...

981
01:09:18,292 --> 01:09:19,326
nobody.

982
01:09:21,262 --> 01:09:23,931
But as soon as
the race was over,

983
01:09:23,998 --> 01:09:27,334
I'd be right back
to where I started...

984
01:09:27,401 --> 01:09:29,103
waiting for the flags to wave.

985
01:09:30,703 --> 01:09:34,641
I knew I had to get out,
do something different.

986
01:09:34,707 --> 01:09:39,679
But I'll tell you, Bianca,
I feel like I'm pushing my luck.

987
01:09:40,981 --> 01:09:42,016
No.

988
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:45,086
We're gonna make it
to Los Angeles...

989
01:09:46,487 --> 01:09:49,889
for your brother,
for my daughter.

990
01:09:49,957 --> 01:09:53,260
Look at me.
Look at me.

991
01:10:03,770 --> 01:10:05,973
You saved my life.

992
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:09,776
We're gonna get through this,
I promise.

993
01:10:18,285 --> 01:10:19,686
You ready?

994
01:10:21,522 --> 01:10:22,856
All right, let's go.

995
01:10:55,322 --> 01:10:57,091
Gillian?

996
01:10:57,158 --> 01:10:59,994
I want to make
an arrangement with you.

997
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:02,596
Forget everything
that Davie wanted.

998
01:11:02,662 --> 01:11:05,533
Forget about winning this race.

999
01:11:05,599 --> 01:11:07,902
I'll make it worth your while.

1000
01:11:07,968 --> 01:11:09,370
Forget about winning the race?

1001
01:11:09,436 --> 01:11:13,773
Yes, Jack...
you give me no choice.

1002
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:16,043
You are coming
near checkpoint three,

1003
01:11:16,110 --> 01:11:20,314
and those other gearhead
idiots are nowhere near you.

1004
01:11:20,381 --> 01:11:24,518
What's it going to take for
you to lose this race, huh?

1005
01:11:24,585 --> 01:11:27,588
Five mil?

1006
01:11:27,655 --> 01:11:31,791
Ten mil?
What do you want?

1007
01:11:31,858 --> 01:11:33,260
Talk to me!

1008
01:11:33,327 --> 01:11:34,694
You know what, Gillian?

1009
01:11:34,761 --> 01:11:36,263
Right now I'm currently driving,

1010
01:11:36,330 --> 01:11:37,897
and I'm pretty sure
it's against the law

1011
01:11:37,965 --> 01:11:40,501
to drive and talk in
the state of Arizona.

1012
01:11:40,568 --> 01:11:41,602
Jack?

1013
01:11:41,669 --> 01:11:44,939
Jack? Jack!

1014
01:11:45,005 --> 01:11:47,975
Oh, you miserable bastard!

1015
01:12:01,922 --> 01:12:03,390
We're getting close
to checkpoint three,

1016
01:12:03,457 --> 01:12:04,925
and she is freaking out.

1017
01:12:04,992 --> 01:12:06,759
Good, nice to have
them on that side of things

1018
01:12:06,826 --> 01:12:07,962
for a change.

1019
01:12:26,046 --> 01:12:28,582
When does Jack get here?

1020
01:12:28,649 --> 01:12:30,117
Get him outta the car.

1021
01:12:37,057 --> 01:12:39,159
Fuck you, Nelson.

1022
01:12:40,961 --> 01:12:43,130
You motherfucker!

1023
01:12:45,733 --> 01:12:47,901
- Fucker!
- Oh, fuck you!

1024
01:12:47,968 --> 01:12:48,902
- Shut up!
- Fuck you!

1025
01:12:50,571 --> 01:12:52,772
Fuck you!

1026
01:12:52,839 --> 01:12:54,807
Shut up!

1027
01:12:54,874 --> 01:12:56,910
Get...
get down, motherfucker.

1028
01:12:58,078 --> 01:13:00,347
Ha, ha, ha, Nelson!

1029
01:13:00,414 --> 01:13:01,682
You fucking bitch.

1030
01:13:08,222 --> 01:13:10,557
I want your brother to see
you dead in the sand, esse.

1031
01:13:10,624 --> 01:13:11,891
Oh, man...

1032
01:13:11,959 --> 01:13:13,527
Just fucking do it!

1033
01:13:17,998 --> 01:13:19,967
Fuck you!

1034
01:13:25,272 --> 01:13:27,007
Oh!

1035
01:13:29,876 --> 01:13:31,878
Come in!

1036
01:13:35,882 --> 01:13:37,384
Jesus!

1037
01:13:37,451 --> 01:13:39,520
You couldn't take that
crap off of your head?

1038
01:13:39,586 --> 01:13:41,255
She's six, for chrissake!

1039
01:13:41,322 --> 01:13:44,358
Oh, you think she's pick
you up out of a lineup?

1040
01:13:44,425 --> 01:13:46,927
Ai...
now I got to deal with this.

1041
01:13:46,994 --> 01:13:48,962
Come here, come here...

1042
01:13:49,029 --> 01:13:51,565
Hey there, little one,
don't cry, okay?

1043
01:13:51,632 --> 01:13:53,701
Everything's gonna be okay.

1044
01:13:53,767 --> 01:13:56,570
You must be Sophia, huh?

1045
01:13:56,637 --> 01:13:59,073
Would you get the hell out?

1046
01:13:59,139 --> 01:14:00,974
Where's Mommy?

1047
01:14:02,242 --> 01:14:03,944
We're going to see Mommy.

1048
01:14:04,011 --> 01:14:06,914
Have you ever been
on a helicopter before?

1049
01:14:09,817 --> 01:14:12,086
What the hell is this?

1050
01:14:12,152 --> 01:14:14,421
Don't stop, Jack,
keep driving.

1051
01:14:19,059 --> 01:14:20,494
Oh, my God, it's Nelson.

1052
01:14:32,473 --> 01:14:33,907
Nelson?

1053
01:14:35,275 --> 01:14:36,477
Nelson?

1054
01:14:36,543 --> 01:14:38,045
It's okay, buddy.

1055
01:14:38,112 --> 01:14:39,546
I got you, I got you.

1056
01:14:40,681 --> 01:14:41,915
It's gonna be okay, buddy.

1057
01:14:41,982 --> 01:14:44,284
I'm gonna get you
to the hospital.

1058
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:46,019
- Don't talk.
- I'm sorry!

1059
01:14:46,086 --> 01:14:49,189
I'm sorry you had...
you were stuck with me...

1060
01:14:49,256 --> 01:14:51,759
- No.
- ...for a brother.

1061
01:14:51,825 --> 01:14:53,627
- No, man!
- I'm sorry.

1062
01:14:53,694 --> 01:14:55,062
No!

1063
01:14:56,730 --> 01:14:58,332
No, Nelson!

1064
01:15:12,913 --> 01:15:14,415
Jack...

1065
01:15:25,793 --> 01:15:27,060
Davie.

1066
01:15:32,199 --> 01:15:34,868
It's Gillian.

1067
01:15:34,935 --> 01:15:36,570
I'm coming for you.

1068
01:15:36,637 --> 01:15:38,205
No, not for me...

1069
01:15:38,272 --> 01:15:40,174
for little Sophia.

1070
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:42,543
Mommy! Mommy?

1071
01:15:42,609 --> 01:15:43,610
Where's Mommy?

1072
01:15:43,677 --> 01:15:45,946
What is it?

1073
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:51,385
Mommy, are you there?

1074
01:15:51,452 --> 01:15:52,386
Sophia!

1075
01:15:52,453 --> 01:15:53,922
Baby, it's gonna be all right.

1076
01:15:53,987 --> 01:15:55,389
Mommy!

1077
01:15:55,456 --> 01:15:56,590
We're coming for you.

1078
01:15:56,657 --> 01:15:57,926
Mommy?

1079
01:15:57,991 --> 01:15:59,593
It's okay.
It's okay!

1080
01:16:02,763 --> 01:16:03,697
You listen to me.

1081
01:16:03,764 --> 01:16:05,332
Shut up, Jack.

1082
01:16:05,399 --> 01:16:09,236
You and that bitch meet me
at the finish line downtown.

1083
01:16:09,303 --> 01:16:12,005
You give me the thumb drives,
I'll give you the kid.

1084
01:16:12,072 --> 01:16:13,841
These are my terms.

1085
01:16:18,979 --> 01:16:20,647
Help me get my brother.

1086
01:16:21,815 --> 01:16:23,584
And grab that gun.

1087
01:17:21,041 --> 01:17:22,643
Fuck, dude.

1088
01:17:29,951 --> 01:17:31,318
Fuck!

1089
01:17:46,199 --> 01:17:48,068
What the fuck, man?

1090
01:17:55,809 --> 01:17:58,412
Shit, first fucking place.

1091
01:18:05,819 --> 01:18:07,354
It's an ambush!

1092
01:18:17,464 --> 01:18:19,099
Oh!

1093
01:18:33,513 --> 01:18:35,782
You son of a bitch, come here.

1094
01:18:37,618 --> 01:18:38,552
Sophia!

1095
01:18:38,619 --> 01:18:39,886
Let her go!

1096
01:18:39,954 --> 01:18:41,622
This is for my brother,
you son of a bitch!

1097
01:18:41,688 --> 01:18:43,890
Jack, stop, goddamn it,
or she dies, too!

1098
01:18:45,392 --> 01:18:46,893
Let the girl go

1099
01:18:46,961 --> 01:18:48,862
and you and I will sort
the rest out, you hear me?

1100
01:18:48,930 --> 01:18:51,531
Give my brother the thumb
drives, and let him go.

1101
01:18:51,598 --> 01:18:53,333
Give me back my daughter!

1102
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:55,168
Gimme the drives, Bianca.

1103
01:18:57,005 --> 01:18:59,040
Let the girl go and
I'll let Davie here go...

1104
01:18:59,107 --> 01:19:00,407
even trade.

1105
01:19:00,474 --> 01:19:02,442
These are my terms, Jack!

1106
01:19:02,509 --> 01:19:05,345
Give my brother the thumb drives
and let him go.

1107
01:19:07,414 --> 01:19:09,083
Don't hurt her, please!

1108
01:19:09,149 --> 01:19:11,284
Please, don't hurt her!

1109
01:19:11,351 --> 01:19:12,920
Where are the drives, Bianca?

1110
01:19:12,987 --> 01:19:14,354
Give her back to me!

1111
01:19:14,421 --> 01:19:16,289
If I was you, I would
shut up real fast.

1112
01:19:16,356 --> 01:19:18,258
Let her go!

1113
01:19:34,108 --> 01:19:36,209
Drop the gun!

1114
01:19:39,279 --> 01:19:40,547
Let go of the girl!

1115
01:19:42,883 --> 01:19:44,085
Let go of the girl!

1116
01:19:44,152 --> 01:19:45,852
Drop your weapon!

1117
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:46,954
Put your hands on the car!

1118
01:19:50,357 --> 01:19:52,659
Sophia! Sophia!

1119
01:19:52,726 --> 01:19:55,796
- Wait!
- You'll see your daughter.

1120
01:19:55,862 --> 01:19:56,863
Take her to the vehicle.

1121
01:20:02,170 --> 01:20:03,370
Are you Six-Speed Nina?

1122
01:20:03,437 --> 01:20:06,707
Yes. What the hell?

1123
01:20:06,773 --> 01:20:08,575
I'll kill your whole
fucking family, Jack.

1124
01:20:12,679 --> 01:20:14,481
Jack, what are they gonna do?

1125
01:20:19,753 --> 01:20:22,190
- Are you Bianca?
- That's my daughter!

1126
01:20:22,255 --> 01:20:24,058
That's what she's been
telling us over and over again.

1127
01:20:24,125 --> 01:20:25,525
Come here, honey.

1128
01:20:25,592 --> 01:20:28,261
You can sit in here, up front.

1129
01:20:28,328 --> 01:20:29,663
Mommy and Daddy
can ride in back.

1130
01:20:29,730 --> 01:20:32,265
It'll all be okay,
just sit tight.

1131
01:20:33,767 --> 01:20:36,570
- Hi, Mommy.
- Hi, sweetie.

1132
01:20:36,636 --> 01:20:38,371
Mommy, I wanna get out,

1133
01:20:38,438 --> 01:20:41,142
I don't wanna be
in any more cars.

1134
01:20:41,209 --> 01:20:43,243
You and me both, kid.
