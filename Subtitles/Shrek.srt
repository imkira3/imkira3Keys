00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,730
- Really tall?
- No! I'm an ogre.

155
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:30,020
You know.
Grab your torch and pitchforks.

156
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,110
Doesn't that bother you?

157
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:34,320
Nope.

158
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,280
- Really?
- Really, really.

159
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,490
- Oh.
- Man, I like you. What's your name?

160
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,250
Uh, Shrek.

161
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:47,580
Shrek? Well, you know
what I like about you, Shrek?

162
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:51,710
You got that kind of
I-don't-care-what-nobody-
thinks-of-me thing.

163
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,590
I like that.
I respect that, Shrek. You all right.

164
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:59,680
Whoo! Look at that. Who'd want
to live in a place like that?

165
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,970
That would be my home.

166

Oh! And it is lovely!
Just beautiful.

167
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,810
You are quite a decorator.
It's amazing what you've done
with such a modest budget.

168
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:14,650
I like that boulder.
That is a nice boulder.

169

I guess you don't
entertain much, do you?

170
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,990
I like my privacy.

171
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,660
You know, I do too.
That's another thing we have in common.

172
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,000
Like, I hate it when
you got somebody in your face.

173
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,000
You're trying to give them
a hint, and they won't leave.
There's that awkward silence.

174
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,840
- Can I stay with you?
- Uh, what?

175

Can I stay with you, please?

176
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,890
- Of course!
- Really?

177
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,350
- No.
- Please! I don't wanna go back there!

178
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:49,350
You don't know what it's like to be
considered a freak. Well, maybe you do.

179
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,020
But that's why we gotta stick together.
You gotta let me stay!

180
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,230
- Please! Please!
- Okay! Okay!

181
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,900
- But one night only.
- Ah! Thank you!

We can stay up late,
swapping manly stories,

184
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:05,200
and in the morning
I'm making waffles.

- Oh!
- Where do, uh, I sleep?

Outside!

Oh, well,
I guess that's cool.

I mean, I don't know you,
and you don't know me,

00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,170
so I guess outside
is best, you know.

[Sniffles]
Here I go.

Good night.

I mean, I do like the outdoors.
I'm a donkey. I was born outside.

00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,360
I'll just be sitting by myself
outside, I guess, you know.

194
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,730
By myself, outside.

00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:41,610
I'm all alone
There's no one here beside me

Well, gents, it's a far cry from
the farm, but what choice do we have?

It's not home,
but it'll do just fine.

seven other men, she's not easy.

306
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:56,170
Just kiss her dead, frozen lips
and find out what a live wire she is.

307
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:00,010
Come on.
Give it up for Snow White!

308
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:02,720
And last,
but certainly not least,

309
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,890
bachelorette number three
is a fiery redhead...

310
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:07,520
from a dragon-guarded castle
surrounded by hot boiling lava!

311

But don't let that cool you off.

312
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:12,900
She's a loaded pistol
who likes pina coladas
and getting caught in the rain.

313
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:17,030
Yours for the rescuing,
Princess Fiona!

314
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:19,570
So will it be
bachelorette number one,

315
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:23,160
bachelorette number two
or bachelorette number three?

Pick number three, my Lord!

320

Okay, okay, uh, number three!

Lord Farquaad,
you've chosen Princess Fiona.

322

If you love pina coladas

323

325
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,230
All I have to do is
just find someone who can go--

326
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,570
But I probably should mention
the little thing that happens at night.

327
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,570
- I'll do it.
- Yes, but after sunset--

328
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:00,740
Silence! I will make
this Princess Fiona my queen,

329
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:04,990
and DuLoc will finally
have the perfect king!

330

a tournament.

But that's it. That's it
right there. That's DuLoc.

I told ya I'd find it.

pull some of that ogre stuff on him?

00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:34,150
[Sniffs]
You know, not everybody likes onions.

458
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:36,860
Cake! Everybody loves cakes!
Cakes have layers.

459
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:40,860
I don't care...
what everyone likes.

460
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:44,660
Ogres are not like cakes.

461
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,870
You know what else
everybody likes? Parfaits.

462
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,880
Have you ever met a person, you
say, Let's get some parfait,

463
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,880
they say, No,
I don't like no parfait?

464
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,710
- Parfaits are delicious.
- No!

465
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,550
You dense, irritating,
miniature beast of burden!

466
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:02,550
Ogres are like onions!
End of story.

467
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,600
Bye-bye. See ya later.

468
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:12,860
Parfaits may be the most delicious thing
on the whole damn planet.

469
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:15,150
You know, I think
I preferred your humming.

470
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,900
Do you have a tissue or something?
I'm making a mess.

471
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:20,900
Just the word parfait
make me start slobbering.

472
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:31,210
I'm on my way from misery
to happiness today

473
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:33,790
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh

474
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:39,340
I'm on my way from misery
to happiness today

475
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,880
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh

476
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:45,890
And everything
that you receive up yonder

477
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:49,890
Is what you give to me
the day I wander

478
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,940
I'm on my way

479
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,940
I'm on my way

480
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,110
I'm on my way

481
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:02,650
Ooh! Shrek!
Did you do that?

482
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:06,530
You gotta warn somebody before you
just crack one off. My mouth was open.

483
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:10,330
Believe me, Donkey, if
it was me, you'd be dead.

484
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:13,170
[Sniffs]
It's brimstone.

485
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:16,420
- We must be getting close.
- Yeah, right, brimstone.

486
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,590
Don't be talking about it's
the brimstone. I know what I
smell. It wasn't no brimstone.

487
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:22,630
It didn't come off
no stone neither.

488
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,760
[Rumbling]

489
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:43,990
Sure, it's big enough,
but look at the location.

490
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:47,030
[Laughing]

491
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,830
Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when
you said ogres have layers?

492
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,830
Oh, aye.

493
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:57,500
Well, I have a bit
of a confession to make.

494
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:00,960
Donkeys don't have layers. We wear
our fear right out there on our sleeves.

495
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:05,130
- Wait a second.
Donkeys don't have sleeves.
- You know what I mean.

496
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,890
You can't tell me
you're afraid of heights.

497
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:12,560
I'm just a little uncomfortable
about being on a rickety bridge
over a boiling lake of lava!

498
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,690
Come on, Donkey.
I'm right here beside ya, okay?

499
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:19,440
For emotional support,

500
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:24,070
we'll just tackle this thing
together one little baby step at a time.

501
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:26,070
- Really?
- Really, really.

502
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:29,370
- Okay, that makes me
feel so much better.
-Just keep moving.

503
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:34,040
- And don't look down.
- Okay, don't look down.
Don't look down.

504
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:37,500
Don't look down.
Keep on moving. Don't look down.

505
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:41,380
[Gasps]
Shrek! I'm looking down!

506
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:44,380
Oh, God, I can't do this!
Just let me off, please!

507
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:48,010
- But you're already halfway.
- But I know that half is safe!

508
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:50,890
Okay, fine. I don't
have time for this. You go back.

509
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:53,390
- Shrek, no! Wait!
-Just, Donkey--

510
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:56,560
- Let's have a dance then, shall we?
- Don't do that!

511
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,520
Oh, I'm sorry. Do what?

512
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:03,690
- Oh, this?
- Yes, that!

513
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:07,200
Yes? Yes, do it. Okay.

514
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,570
[Screams]
No, Shrek!

515
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,780
- No! Stop it!
- You said do it! I'm doing it.

516
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:17,120
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.
Shrek, I'm gonna die.

517
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:19,710
Oh!

518
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:23,800
That'll do, Donkey.
That'll do.

519
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:29,430
Cool.

520
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:32,260
[Donkey] So where is this
fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway?

521
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:36,100
Inside, waiting for us
to rescue her.

522
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:39,100
[Chuckles]
I was talking about the dragon, Shrek.

523
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,440
[Water Dripping]

524
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,030
[Wind Howling]

525
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,500
[Donkey Whispering]
You afraid?

526
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,870
No, but-- Shh.

527
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,500
Oh, good. Me neither.
[Gasps]

528
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:06,960
'Cause there's nothing
wrong with being afraid.

529
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:10,300
Fear's a sensible response
to an unfamiliar situation.

530
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,430
Unfamiliar dangerous
situation, I might add.

531
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:15,140
With a dragon that breathes fire
and eats knights and breathes fire,

532
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:18,680
it sure doesn't mean you're a coward
if you're a little scared.

533
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:22,770
I sure as heck am not a coward.
I know that. [Gasps]

534
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:26,190
Donkey, two things, okay?

535
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,820
Shut... up.

536
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,660
Now go over there and see
if you can find any stairs.

537
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,370
Stairs? I thought
we was looking for the princess.

538
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:39,330
The princess will be up the stairs in
the highest room in the tallest tower.

539
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:43,000
- What makes you think she'll be there?
- I read it in a book once.

540
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:47,000
Cool. You handle the dragon.
I'll handle the stairs.

541
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,130
I'll find those stairs.
I'll whip their butt too.

542
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,180
Those stairs won't know
which way they're going.

543
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,680
[Creaking]

544
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,640
I'm gonna take drastic steps.

545
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,520
Kick it to the kerb. Don't mess
with me. I'm the stair master.

546
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:06,190
I've mastered the stairs.
I wish I had a step right here.
I'd step all over it.

547
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:12,700
Well, at least we know
where the princess is, but where's the--

548
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:17,030
Dragon!
[Screams]

549
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,040
[Gasps]

550
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,090
[Roars]

551
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,880
Donkey, look out!
[Screams]

552
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:38,060
[Screams]

553
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,230
[Whimpering]

554
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,520
- Got ya!
- [Roars]

555
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:49,690
[Gasps]

556
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:55,030
[Shouts]
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

557
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:58,080
[Screaming]

558
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:08,920
[Gasps]

559
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,630
Oh! Aah! Aah!

560
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:17,220
[Gasping]

561
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:22,220
[Growls]

562
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,730
No. Oh, no. No!
[Screams]

563
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:29,440
- Oh, what large teeth you have.
- [Growls]

564
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,360
I mean, white, sparkling teeth.
I know you probably hear this
all the time from your food,

565
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,570
but you must bleach, 'cause that
is one dazzling smile you got there.

566
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:40,160
Do I detect a hint
of minty freshness?

567
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:45,000
And you know what else?
You're-- You're a girl dragon!

568
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:49,590
Oh, sure! I mean,
of course you're a girl dragon.

569
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:53,460
You're just reeking
of feminine beauty.

570
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,880
What's the matter with you?
You got something in your eye?

571
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:58,800
Ooh. Oh. Oh.

572
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:01,310
Man, I'd really love to stay,
but, you know, I'm, uh-- [Coughs]

573
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:05,350
I'm an asthmatic, and
I don't know if it'd work out if
you're gonna blow smoke rings.

574
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:07,350
Shrek!
[Gasps]

575
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,150
[Whimpering]
No! Shrek! Shrek!

576
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:13,150
Shrek!

577
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:17,030
[Groans, Sighs]

578
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:20,320
[Chorus Vocalising]

579
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:29,000
[Vocalising Continues]

580
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,350
[Vocalising Continues]

581
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,850
Oh! Oh!

582
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:47,850
- Wake up!
- What?

583
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,560
Are you Princess Fiona?

584
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:54,980
I am, awaiting a knight
so bold as to rescue me.

585
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,070
Oh, that's nice.
Now let's go!

586
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:59,150
But wait, Sir Knight.

587
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,530
This be-ith our first meeting.

588
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:05,330
Should it not be
a wonderful, romantic moment?

589
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:09,750
- Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time.
- Hey, wait. What are you doing?

590
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:11,920
You should sweep me
off my feet...

591
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,380
out yonder window and down a rope
on to your valiant steed.

592
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:18,260
You've had a lot of time
to plan this, haven't you?

593
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:22,590
Mm-hmm.
[Screams, Grunts]

594
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,560
But we have to
savour this moment!

595
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,390
You could recite
an epic poem for me.

596
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,940
A ballad? A sonnet!

597
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:34,270
- A Limerick? Or something!
- I don't think so.

598
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,780
Can I at least know
the name of my champion?

599
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,780
Um, Shrek.

600
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:44,580
Sir Shrek.
[Clears Throat]

601
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:49,410
I pray that you take this favour
as a token of my gratitude.

602
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,540
Thanks!

603
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:56,460
[Roaring]

604
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,380
You didn't slay the dragon?

605
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,920
- It's on my to-do list. Now come on!
- [Screams]

606
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,590
But this isn't right!

607
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,930
You were meant to charge in,
sword drawn, banner flying.

608
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:08,100
That's what all
the other knights did.

609
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,480
Yeah, right before
they burst into flame.

610
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,100
That's not the point. Oh!

611
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,650
Wait. Where are you going?
The exit's over there.

612
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:18,780
Well, I have to save my ass.

613
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:22,070
What kind of knight are you?

614
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:24,570
One of a kind.

615
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,030
[Donkey]
Slowdown. Slowdown, baby, please.

616
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:31,330
I believe it's healthy to get to
know someone over a long period of time.

617
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:34,000
Just call me old-fashioned.
[Laughs]

618
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,590
I don't want to rush into
a physical relationship.

619
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:41,130
I'm not emotionally ready
for a commitment of, uh, this--

620
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,510
Magnitude really is
the word I'm looking for.

621
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:47,100
Magnitude-- Hey, that is
unwanted physical contact.

622
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,640
Hey, what are you doing?

623
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,980
Okay, okay. Let's just backup a little
and take this one step a ta time.

624
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:57,190
We really should get to know each other
first as friends or pen pals.

625
00:37:57,270 --> 00:38:01,490
I'm on theroada lot,
but I just love receiving cards--

626
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,990
I'd really love
to stay, but--

627
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:06,660
Don't do that! That's my tail!
That's my personal tail.

628
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:10,160
You're gonna tear it off.
I don't give permission-- What
are you gonna do with that?

629
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,040
Hey, now. No way.
No! No!

630

00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:49,530
Yeah, it's getting him
to shut up that's the trick.

- You did it!

657
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:31,930
You rescued me!
You're amazing. You're--

658
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:35,760
You're wonderful. You're...

659
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,140
a little unorthodox I'll admit.

660
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:43,150
But thy deed is great,
and thine heart is pure.

661

- I am eternally in your debt.
- [Clears Throat]

And where would a brave knight be
without his noble steed?

663
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:56,200
I hope you heard that. She called me
a noble steed. She think I'm a steed.

[Fiona Laughs]
The battle is won.

665
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,040
You may remove your helmet,
good Sir Knight.

666
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,710
- Uh, no.
- Why not?

667
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:07,000
I have helmet hair.

668
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:10,300
Please. I would'st look
upon the face of my rescuer.

No, no, you wouldn't-- 'st.

670
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:15,510
But how will you kiss me?

671
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:19,350
What? That wasn't
in the job description.

672
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:21,810
Maybe it's a perk.

673
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:26,320
No, it's destiny.
Oh, you must know how it goes.

674
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,190
A princess locked in a tower
and beset by a dragon...

675
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,200
is rescued by a brave knight,

676
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,580
and then they share
true love's first kiss.

677
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,740
Hmm? With Shrek?
You think-- Wait.

678
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:42,000
Wait. You think that
Shrek is your true love?

679
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,080
Well, yes.

is your true love!

What is so funny?

683
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:55,760
Let's just say I'm
not your type, okay?

684
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:59,350
Of course, you are.
You're my rescuer.

685
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:01,890
Now-- Now remove your helmet.

686
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,190
Look. I really don't think
this is a good idea.

687
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:06,270
-Just take off the helmet.
- I'm not going to.

688
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,520
- Take it off.
- No!

689
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:09,690
- Now!
- Okay!

690
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:14,280
Easy. As you command,
Your Highness.

691
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:27,750
You-- You're a-- an ogre.

692
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:31,760
Oh, you were expecting
Prince Charming.

693
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,340
Well, yes, actually.

694
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:39,510
Oh, no. This is all wrong.

695
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,890
You're not supposed
to be an ogre.

696
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:47,230
[Sighs] Princess, I was sent
to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay?

697
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:49,230
He's the one
who wants to marry you.

698
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:51,230
Then why didn't
he come rescue me?

699
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:55,650
Good question. You should
ask him that when we get there.

700
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,780
But I have to be rescued
by my true love,

701
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:01,620
not by some ogre
and his-- his pet.

702
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,750
So much for noble steed.

703
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:06,460
You're not making
my job any easier.

704
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:09,920
I'm sorry, but your job
is not my problem.

705
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,260
You can tell Lord Farquaad
that if he wants to rescue me properly,

706
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:17,680
I'll be waiting for him
right here.

707
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:22,810
Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy,
all right? I'm a delivery boy.

708
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:25,140
You wouldn't dare.

709
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:27,230
- Put me down!
- Ya coming, Donkey?

710
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:29,270
I'm right behind ya.

711
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:32,940
Put me down, or you will
suffer the consequences!

712
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:37,530
This is not dignified!
Put me down! [Screams]

713
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:40,490
Okay, so here's
another question.

714
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:43,620
Say there's a woman
that digs you, right, but you
don't really like her that way.

715
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:46,080
How do you let her down real easy
so her feelings aren't hurt,

716
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,670
but you don't get burned
to a crisp and eaten?

717
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:51,500
You just tell her
she's not your true love.

718
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:54,300
Everyone knowest what happens
when you find your--

Hey!
[Sighs]

720
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:59,340
The sooner we get
to DuLoc the better.

721
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:02,350
You're gonna love it there,
Princess. It's beautiful!

722
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:06,180
And what of my groom-to-be?
Lord Farquaad? What's he like?

723
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:08,390
Let me put it this way,
Princess.

724
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,480
Men of Farquaad's stature
are in short supply.

725
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,480
[Laughs]

726
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:18,650
I don't know. There are those who
think little of him.

[Both Laughing]

728
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:23,660
Stop it. Stop it,
both of you.

729
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:28,710
You're just jealous you can
never measure up to a great
ruler like Lord Farquaad.

730
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:31,710
Yeah, well, maybe
you're right, Princess.

731
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:35,090
But I'll let you do the measuring
when you see him tomorrow.

732
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:39,380
Tomorrow?
It'll take that Ion?

733
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:44,180
- Shouldn't we stop to make camp?
- No, that'll take longer.

734
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:48,680
- We can keep going.
- But there's robbers in the woods.

735
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:52,100
Whoa! Time out, Shrek!
Camping is starting to sound good.

736
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:56,280
Hey, come on.
I'm scarier than anything we're
going to see in this forest.

737
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,740
I need to find
somewhere to camp now!

- Hey! Over here.
- Shrek, we can do better than that.

741
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:12,370
I don't think
this is fit for a princess.

742
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:15,250
No, no, it's perfect.
It just needs a few homey touches.

743
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:20,260
- Homey touches? Like what?
- [Crashing]

744
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:24,600
A door? Well, gentlemen,
I bid thee good night.

745
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,060
You want me to read you
a bedtime story? I will.

746
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:29,470
I said good night!

747
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:33,900
Shrek, what are you doing?

748
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:37,020
[Laughs]
I just-- You know-- Oh, come on.

749
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:39,740
I was just kidding.

And, uh, that one,
that's Throwback,

752
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:52,120
the only ogre to ever spit
over three wheat fields.

753
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:55,290
Right. Yeah.

754
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:58,300
Hey, can you tell my future
from these stars?

755
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,970
The stars don't tell the future, Donkey.
They tell stories.

756
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:05,640
Look, there's BITNET,
the Fitment.

757
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:09,350
- You can guess what he's famous for.
- I know you're making this up.

758
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:12,140
No, look.
There he is,

759
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:15,310
and there's the group of hunters
running away from his stench.

760
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,980

Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do
when we get our swamp anyway?

766
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,830
Our swamp?

767
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:37,000
You know, when we're through
rescuing the princess.

768

We? Donkey, there's no we.
There's no our.

769

There's just me and my swamp.

770
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:48,510
The first thing I'm gonna do is build
a ten-foot wall around my land.

771
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,100
You cut me deep, Shrek.

772
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:54,520
You cut me real deep just now.

773
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,520
You know what I think?

774
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,730
I think this whole wall thing
is just a way to keep somebody out.

775
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:03,990
- No, do ya think?
- Are you hiding something?

Never mind, Donkey.

00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:09,530
Oh, this is another one of
those onion things, isn't it?

778
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:13,200
No, this is one of those drop-it
and leave-it-alone things.

- I'm not blocking.

- Donkey, I'm warning you.

What you got against the whole world?

I'm not the one
with the problem, okay?

787

It's the world that seems
to have a problem with me.

My beloved monster and me

That comes between me
and the awful sting

00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:15,910
That comes from living in a world

Your future awaits you.

- That's DuLoc?
- Yeah, I know.

932
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,550
You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's
compensating for something,

933
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:08,130
which I think means
he has a really-- Ow!

Um, I, uh--

But, Shrek?

- He doesn't look so good.
- What are you talking about? I'm fine.

940
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:28,320
That's what they always say,

Oh, man, I can't feel my toes!

I don't have any toes!

Well, they're also great

don't marry Farquaad?

can break the spell.

well, I don't really like it,

Take a good look
at me, Donkey.

01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:26,110
who could ever love a beast
so hideous and ugly?

1063
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,610
Princessand ugly
don't go together.

1064
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:31,120
- That's why I can't
stay here with Shrek.
- [Gasps]

1065
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:35,620
My only chance to live happily
ever after is to marry my truelove.

1066
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:39,120
- [Deep Sigh]
- Don't you see, Donkey?

1067
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:42,500
That's just how
it has to be.

1068
01:04:42,590 --> 01:04:45,630
It's the only way
to break the spell.

1069
01:04:45,710 --> 01:04:48,470
- You at least gotta
tell Shrek the truth.
- No!

1070
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:51,470
You can't breathe a word.
No one must ever know.

1071
01:04:51,550 --> 01:04:53,680
What's the point of being able to talk
if you gotta keep secrets?

1072
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:56,890
Promise you won't tell.
Promise!

1073
01:04:56,980 --> 01:05:00,060
All right, all right.
I won't tell him. But you should.

1074
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:03,150
I just know before this is over,
I'm gonna need a whole lot
of serious therapy.

1075
01:05:03,230 --> 01:05:06,780
- Look at my eye twitching.
- [Door Opens]

1076
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:29,380
[Snoring]

1077
01:05:29,470 --> 01:05:33,220
[Fiona]
I tell him, I tell him not.

1078
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:37,680
I tell him,
I tell him not.

1079
01:05:37,770 --> 01:05:39,690
I tell him.

1080
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:41,850
Shrek!

1081
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:44,480
Shrek, there's something
I want--

1082
01:05:44,570 --> 01:05:47,570
[Snoring]

1083
01:06:05,290 --> 01:06:07,500
Shrek.

1084
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:10,970
- Are you all right?
- Perfect!

1085
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:13,010
Never been better.

1086
01:06:13,090 --> 01:06:16,390
I-- I don't--
There's something I have to tell you.

1087
01:06:16,470 --> 01:06:19,020
You don't have to tell me
anything, Princess.

1088
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:21,190
- I heard enough last night.
- You heard what I said?

1089
01:06:21,270 --> 01:06:23,190
Every word.

1090
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:25,440
I thought you'd understand.

1091
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:27,440
Oh, I understand.

1092
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:31,110
Like you said, Who could
love a hideous, ugly beast?

1093
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,860
But I thought that
wouldn't matter to you.

1094
01:06:33,950 --> 01:06:35,700
Yeah? Well, it does.

1095
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:38,200
[Gasps, Sighs]

1096
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:40,500
- Ah, right on time.
- [Horse Whinnies]

1097
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:43,460
Princess, I've brought you
a little something.

1098
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:47,790
[Fanfare]

1099
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:51,550
[Yawns]
What'd I miss? What'd I miss?

1100
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:54,260
[Muffled] Who said that?
Couldn't have been a donkey.

1101
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:58,100
Princess Fiona.

1102
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:00,890
As promised.
Now hand it over.

1103
01:07:00,970 --> 01:07:05,230
Very well, ogre. The deed
to your swamp, cleared out, as agreed.

1104
01:07:05,310 --> 01:07:09,860
Take it and go
before I change my mind.

1105
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:12,780
Forgive me, Princess,
for startling you,

1106
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:14,780
but you startled me,

1107
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:18,530
for I have never seen
such a radiant beauty before.

1108
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:21,620
I am Lord Farquaad.

1109
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:25,580
Lord Farquaad?
Oh, no, no.

1110
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:28,630
- [Snaps Fingers]
- Forgive me, my Lord,
for I was just saying...

1111
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:34,170
a short... farewell.

1112
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:38,890
That is so sweet. You don't have
to waste good manners on the ogre.

1113
01:07:38,970 --> 01:07:40,890
It's not like
it has feelings.

1114
01:07:40,970 --> 01:07:44,940
No, you're right.
It doesn't.

1115
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:49,020
Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair,
flawless Fiona.

1116
01:07:49,110 --> 01:07:52,110
- I ask your hand in marriage.
- [Gasps]

1117
01:07:52,190 --> 01:07:57,240
Will you be the perfect bride
for the perfect groom?

1118
01:08:00,530 --> 01:08:05,710
Lord Farquaad, I accept.
Nothing would make--

1119
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:08,960
Excellent! I'll start the plans,
for tomorrow we wed!

1120
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:10,960
No! I mean, uh,

1121
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:13,420
why wait?

1122
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:17,340
Let's get married today
before the sun sets.

1123
01:08:17,430 --> 01:08:20,140
Oh, anxious, are we?
You're right.

1124
01:08:20,220 --> 01:08:24,140
The sooner, the better.
There's so much to do!

1125
01:08:24,220 --> 01:08:26,560
There's the caterer,
the cake, the band, the guest list.

1126
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:29,650
Captain, round up
some guests!

1127
01:08:29,730 --> 01:08:32,440
[Fiona]
Fare-thee-well, ogre.

1128
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:35,110
Shrek, what are you doing?
You're letting her get away.

1129
01:08:35,190 --> 01:08:37,910
- Yeah? So what?
- Shrek, there's something
about her you don't know.

1130
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:40,410
Look, I talked to her
last night. She's--

1131
01:08:40,490 --> 01:08:44,540
I know you talked to her last night.
You're great pals, aren't ya?

1132
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:48,370
Now, if you two are such good friends,
why don't you follow her home?

1133
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:50,420
Shrek, I--
I wanna go with you.

1134
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:53,460
I told you, didn't I?
You're not coming home with me.

1135
01:08:53,550 --> 01:08:57,510
I live alone!
My swamp! Me! Nobody else!

1136
01:08:57,590 --> 01:08:59,680
Understand? Nobody!

1137
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:04,600
Especially useless, pathetic,
annoying, talking donkeys!

1138
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:07,850
- But I thought--
- Yeah. You know what?

1139
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:10,150
You thought wrong!

1140
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:13,820
Shrek.

1141
01:09:19,610 --> 01:09:23,620
I heard there was
a secret chord

1142
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:26,750
That David played
and it pleased the Lord

1143
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:31,670
But you don't really
care for music, do ya

1144
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:36,760
It goes like this
the fourth, the fifth

1145
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:39,380
The minor fall
the major lift

1146
01:09:39,470 --> 01:09:46,100
The baffled king
composing hallelujah

1147
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:49,430
Hallelujah

1148
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:52,940
Hallelujah

1149
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:56,940
Hallelujah

1150
01:09:57,030 --> 01:10:01,780
Hallelujah

1151
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:07,200
Baby, I've been here before

1152
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:10,410
I know this room
I've walked this floor

1153
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:15,590
I used to live alone
before I knew you

1154
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:20,380
I've seen your flag
on the marble arch

1155
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:23,800
But love is not
a victory march

1156
01:10:23,890 --> 01:10:28,310
It's a cold
and it's a broken hallelujah

1157
01:10:29,930 --> 01:10:33,060
Hallelujah

1158
01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:36,270
Hallelujah

1159
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:39,400
Hallelujah

1160
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:44,990
Hallelujah

1161
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:50,580
And all I ever
learned from love

1162
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:53,040
I show to shoot at someone

1163
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:55,710
<i>- Who outdrew you
- [Moaning]</i>

1164
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:59,510
And it's not a cry
you can hear at night

1165
01:10:59,590 --> 01:11:02,630
It's not somebody
who's seen the light

1166
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:09,770
<i>- It's a cold
and it's a broken hallelujah
- [Moaning]</i>

1167
01:11:09,850 --> 01:11:12,640
Hallelujah

1168
01:11:12,730 --> 01:11:15,980
Hallelujah

1169
01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:19,320
Hallelujah

1170
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:25,990
Hallelujah

1171
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:32,580
[Thumping Sound]

1172
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:36,290
Donkey?

1173
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:38,590
- [Grunts]
- What are you doing?

1174
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:41,630
I would think, of all people, you would
recognise a wall when you see one.

1175
01:11:41,710 --> 01:11:43,630
Well, yeah.

1176
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:47,090
But the wall's supposed
to go around my swamp, not through it.

1177
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:49,970
It is around your half. See,
that's your half, and this is my half.

1178
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:52,640
Oh! Your half. Hmm.

1179
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:55,270
Yes, my half.
I helped rescue the princess.

1180
01:11:55,350 --> 01:11:57,600
I did half the work,
I get half the booty.

1181
01:11:57,690 --> 01:12:01,020
Now hand me that big old rock,
the one that looks like your head.

1182
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:03,440
- Back off!
- No, you back off.

1183
01:12:03,530 --> 01:12:05,530
- This is my swamp!
- Our swamp.

1184
01:12:05,610 --> 01:12:07,530
- Let go, Donkey!
- You let go.

1185
01:12:07,610 --> 01:12:09,580
- Stubborn jackass!
- Smelly ogre.

1186
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:11,870
Fine!

1187
01:12:11,950 --> 01:12:15,290
- Hey, come back here.
I'm not through with you yet.
- Well, I'm through with you.

1188
01:12:15,370 --> 01:12:18,630
Uh-uh. You know,
with you it's always, Me, me, me!

1189
01:12:18,710 --> 01:12:21,300
Well, guess what!
Now it's my turn!

1190
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:23,510
So you just shut up
and pay attention!

1191
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:25,550
You are mean to me.

1192
01:12:25,630 --> 01:12:28,140
You insult me and you don't
appreciate anything that I do!

1193
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:31,310
You're always pushing me around
or pushing me away.

1194
01:12:31,390 --> 01:12:35,230
Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you
so bad, how come you came back?

1195
01:12:35,310 --> 01:12:38,520
Because that's what friends do!
They forgive each other!

1196
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:41,820
Oh, yeah.
You're right, Donkey.

1197
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:46,110
I forgive you...
for stabbing me in the back!

1198
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:51,620
Ohh! You're so wrapped up
in layers, onion boy, you're
afraid of your own feelings.

1199
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:55,160
- Go away!
- There you are, doing it again
just like you did to Fiona.

1200
01:12:55,250 --> 01:12:57,830
All she ever do was like you,
maybe even love you.

1201
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:02,040
Love me? She said I was ugly,
a hideous creature.

1202
01:13:02,130 --> 01:13:04,050
I heard the two of you
talking.

1203
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:06,050
She wasn't talking about you.

1204
01:13:06,130 --> 01:13:08,470
She was talking about, uh,
somebody else.

1205
01:13:11,010 --> 01:13:13,430
She wasn't talking
about me?

1206
01:13:13,510 --> 01:13:15,810
Well, then who was
she talking about?

1207
01:13:15,890 --> 01:13:18,600
Uh-uh, no way. I am not saying anything.
You don't wanna listen to me.

1208
01:13:18,690 --> 01:13:20,980
- Right? Right?
- Donkey!

1209
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:23,610
- No!
- Okay, look.

1210
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:25,610
I'm sorry, all right?

1211
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:29,150

Why don't you just go ask her?

- Very clean.
- What are you doing here?

1265
01:16:33,050 --> 01:16:35,970
Really, it's rude enough
being alive when no one wants you,

-but showing up uninvited to a wedding--

- Oh, now you wanna talk?

It's a little late for that,
so if you'll excuse me--

1269
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,980
- But you can't marry him.
- And why not?

1270
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:51,940
Because-- Because he's just
marrying you so he can be king.

01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:54,400
Outrageous!
Fiona, don't listen to him.
