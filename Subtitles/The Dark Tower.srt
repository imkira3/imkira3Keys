2
00:01:37,994 --> 00:01:39,787
Come and play with us.
Come and play.

3
00:01:42,582 --> 00:01:45,126
Not gonna get me!
You wish!

4
00:03:31,899 --> 00:03:34,694
Jake.
Mom, you okay?

5
00:03:36,404 --> 00:03:38,364
That was a big one.

6
00:03:40,908 --> 00:03:42,201
Bad dreams?

7
00:03:43,035 --> 00:03:44,412
No.

8
00:03:46,414 --> 00:03:48,166
Come on. Get breakfast.

9
00:04:00,344 --> 00:04:03,473
This morning's quake is
causing major problems for commuters.

10
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:07,685
The 5.7-magnitude quake hit New York
early this morning.

11
00:04:07,852 --> 00:04:11,189
Yet another in a series of quakes
that has rattled both coasts.

12
00:04:11,355 --> 00:04:15,067
Tokyo was hit again.
And with the Berlin quake last week...

13
00:04:15,234 --> 00:04:18,279
REPORTER 2: Question is: What is
causing all these earthquakes?

14
00:04:19,322 --> 00:04:21,741
Christ, even ESPN's doing
the quakes now.

15
00:04:21,908 --> 00:04:24,577
But we still don't know
what's causing them.

16
00:04:24,744 --> 00:04:26,287
Hey. My folks sent me over to see...

17
00:04:26,454 --> 00:04:28,331
- ...if you guys are still alive.
- We're fine, Timmy.

18
00:04:28,498 --> 00:04:29,957
That was pretty intense.

19
00:04:30,124 --> 00:04:32,502
- Yeah.
- You good?

20
00:04:32,668 --> 00:04:34,879
- Yeah.
- We're just running a little late.

21
00:04:35,046 --> 00:04:37,173
- See you later?
- Say hi to your mom for me.

22
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,217
Ma, Laurie says hi.

23
00:04:39,383 --> 00:04:41,469
Don't forget, you have Dr. Hotchkiss
after school.

24
00:04:49,101 --> 00:04:51,521
We're wasting money
on all those shrinks.

25
00:04:53,523 --> 00:04:54,690
He's making progress.

27
00:05:19,715 --> 00:05:21,259
Wait up!

28
00:05:25,221 --> 00:05:27,265
Hey, did you get the books
from my locker?

29
00:05:28,224 --> 00:05:29,725
So when's the apocalypse coming?

30
00:05:29,892 --> 00:05:32,103
Come on, man, just give me my book.

31
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:35,398
- What's wrong, your meds stop working?
- Hey! Hey!

32
00:05:35,565 --> 00:05:37,316
- Give me my book!
- Get off me!

33
00:05:37,483 --> 00:05:39,193
Get off of me. TEACHER: Hey!

34
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,445
Hey. That is enough, Chambers.

35
00:05:42,488 --> 00:05:44,365
I need my book.

36
00:05:45,491 --> 00:05:49,036
Hey. You need to go home and cool off.

37
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,252
You've been, uh, quite busy, Jake.

38
00:06:00,464 --> 00:06:03,676
This big tower in the clouds
you keep dreaming about...

39
00:06:05,344 --> 00:06:09,181
...you say these earthquakes we've been
having have something to do with it.

40
00:06:09,348 --> 00:06:13,519
They happen
because the Tower is under attack.

41
00:06:18,024 --> 00:06:20,484
You're a smart kid, Jake.

42
00:06:20,651 --> 00:06:22,153
You know when you can't differentiate...

43
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,822
- ...between dreams and reality-
- It's not a dream.

44
00:06:24,989 --> 00:06:26,115
Okay? I'm not crazy.

45
00:06:26,908 --> 00:06:28,743
I always see the same thing.

46
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:32,663
The Tower, the Man in Black,
the creepy guys with the fake skins.

47
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:38,419
What if the Tower were destroyed?

48
00:06:40,463 --> 00:06:42,298
Darkness and fire.

49
00:06:45,593 --> 00:06:47,386
Let's talk about your dad.

50
00:06:50,181 --> 00:06:51,682
Surprise.

51
00:06:52,767 --> 00:06:55,102
When you lost your father,
your world fell apart.

52
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,397
You have these visions
of impending hell on Earth...

53
00:06:58,564 --> 00:07:01,734
...because that's how you feel inside.

54
00:07:02,276 --> 00:07:04,487
Even words like "darkness" and "fire"...

55
00:07:04,654 --> 00:07:08,366
...Jake, you're describing
the night your father died.

56
00:07:08,908 --> 00:07:10,910
Can't just be about that.

57
00:07:11,077 --> 00:07:12,578
They're just dreams, Jake.

58
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,498
They're not real.

59
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,443
Watch out.

60
00:07:45,194 --> 00:07:46,362
They'll take you.

61
00:07:46,529 --> 00:07:47,738
They steal kids like you.

62
00:07:47,905 --> 00:07:49,240
Cross them over.

63
00:07:51,492 --> 00:07:52,535
Special ones.

64
00:07:53,744 --> 00:07:56,998
The power of your mind,
that's what they want.

65
00:08:14,015 --> 00:08:16,684
Jake. What's up?

66
00:08:17,268 --> 00:08:18,769
Bad day?

67
00:08:18,936 --> 00:08:20,396
Yeah.

68
00:08:20,563 --> 00:08:22,148
Let's go.

69
00:08:22,314 --> 00:08:23,733
Want to hang out? JAKE: Yeah.

70
00:08:23,899 --> 00:08:26,277
...control, he's unstable.
We need to take the offer.

71
00:08:26,444 --> 00:08:29,280
- It's great treatment for no money.
- It's not about the money.

72
00:08:29,447 --> 00:08:30,698
- I'll wait in your room.
- There's nothing more...

73
00:08:30,865 --> 00:08:32,116
- ...we can do for him now.
- Jesus, Lon!

74
00:08:32,283 --> 00:08:35,244
Can you at least pretend
like he's your own kid?

75
00:08:38,372 --> 00:08:42,001
I'm sorry, baby, we...
We didn't hear you come in.

76
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:44,128
What the hell happened in school today?

77
00:08:44,295 --> 00:08:46,714
You promised me
you're gonna stay out of trouble.

78
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:48,632
Sorry, Mom.

79
00:08:50,217 --> 00:08:51,927
Honey, um...

80
00:08:52,094 --> 00:08:55,556
...the school's been approached
by a clinic upstate.

81
00:08:55,723 --> 00:08:57,558
They work with kids who...

82
00:08:57,725 --> 00:09:00,352
Who are having a hard time.

83
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,229
There's an opening this weekend.

84
00:09:03,147 --> 00:09:04,774
It's supposed to be a great place.

85
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,318
It's science-based:
Brain scans, sleep patterns.

86
00:09:07,485 --> 00:09:10,279
- I think it could...
- Yeah, okay.

87
00:09:14,325 --> 00:09:16,410
Man, psycho camp.

88
00:09:16,577 --> 00:09:17,745
Sucks, dude.

89
00:09:18,287 --> 00:09:21,248
More shrinks. Waste of time.

90
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:33,133
Dude.           - What?

91
00:09:33,302 --> 00:09:34,762
Stop staring at your drawings.

92
00:09:34,929 --> 00:09:36,305
You're freaking me out.

93
00:09:38,015 --> 00:09:40,059
You think I'm crazy too, don't you?

94
00:09:40,768 --> 00:09:41,894
Batshit.

95
00:09:48,776 --> 00:09:50,027
...driving us apart.

96
00:09:53,114 --> 00:09:55,116
I'm just asking...

97
00:09:55,282 --> 00:09:57,284
We need help. We both need help.

98
00:09:57,451 --> 00:09:58,828
We are falling apart.

99
00:09:58,994 --> 00:10:00,496
I love him so much...

100
00:10:00,663 --> 00:10:04,333
...and I just can't stand
to see him like this.

101
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,169
He was such a happy kid.

102
00:10:26,105 --> 00:10:27,982
No more dreams.

103
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:30,484
Just one night of sleep.

104
00:10:49,712 --> 00:10:53,340
You have nothing to be afraid of,
my friend.

105
00:10:54,383 --> 00:10:56,969
Death is not far away.

106
00:10:57,678 --> 00:11:00,639
You want to know
what's on the other side?

107
00:11:01,223 --> 00:11:03,350
Can you see it?

108
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,313
Of course you can't.

109
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:09,648
Because nothing is there.

110
00:11:10,566 --> 00:11:13,444
- It's all a lie.
- Go to hell.

111
00:11:13,694 --> 00:11:16,238
Been there. Now burn.

112
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,710
We lost.

113
00:11:30,544 --> 00:11:32,254
Not while the Tower still stands.

114
00:11:32,421 --> 00:11:33,964
Not while you still stand.

115
00:11:40,304 --> 00:11:42,097
Don't let him get into your head.

116
00:11:42,264 --> 00:11:44,058
Gunslingers.

117
00:11:45,768 --> 00:11:48,771
I do not aim with my hand.

118
00:11:48,938 --> 00:11:51,899
- He who aims with his hand...
- Has forgotten the face of his father.

119
00:11:52,066 --> 00:11:53,275
I aim with my eye.

120
00:11:53,442 --> 00:11:55,444
Gunslinger, over here.

121
00:11:56,695 --> 00:11:58,739
I do not shoot with my hand.

122
00:11:58,906 --> 00:12:01,825
He who shoots with his hand
has forgotten the face of his father.

123
00:12:01,992 --> 00:12:03,702
- I shoot with my mind.
- Gunslingers.

124
00:12:06,205 --> 00:12:07,456
I do not kill with my gun.

125
00:12:08,874 --> 00:12:11,669
He who kills with his gun
has forgotten the face of his father.

126
00:12:12,795 --> 00:12:13,963
I kill with my heart.

127
00:12:15,214 --> 00:12:16,298
Stop breathing.

128
00:12:18,008 --> 00:12:19,593
No.

129
00:12:23,889 --> 00:12:25,349
Breathe.

130
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:27,393
Fight it. Fight it!

131
00:12:36,485 --> 00:12:39,280
It never works on you, does it, Roland?

132
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:43,409
The power you have
to resist my magics...

133
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:47,037
Not forever.

134
00:12:48,914 --> 00:12:50,666
Face me!

135
00:12:51,542 --> 00:12:53,168
Face me.

136
00:12:58,716 --> 00:13:01,302
The Tower will fall, Roland.

137
00:13:02,845 --> 00:13:05,472
Until next time, old friend.

138
00:13:09,685 --> 00:13:12,229
The Man in Black fled
across the desert...

139
00:13:12,396 --> 00:13:13,897
...and the Gunslinger followed.

140
00:13:20,487 --> 00:13:21,613
Holy shit.

141
00:13:23,073 --> 00:13:25,284
- Hey.
- This guy, he's some kind of soldier.

142
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,953
He's called a Gunslinger.

143
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,205
And this house, look,
it's got a U.S. mailbox.

144
00:13:30,372 --> 00:13:32,583
- I think it's in New York.
- Timmy, it's 7 a.m.

145
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,084
Time to say goodbye.

146
00:13:34,251 --> 00:13:37,004
Sorry, got to go. Talk to you later.

147
00:13:55,105 --> 00:13:56,774
The people from the clinic are here.

148
00:13:57,566 --> 00:13:58,984
Now?

149
00:13:59,151 --> 00:14:00,861
I can't... I can't go now.

150
00:14:01,028 --> 00:14:02,529
You got to step up, Jake.

151
00:14:02,696 --> 00:14:05,324
If you won't do it for yourself,
then do it for your mom.

152
00:14:06,992 --> 00:14:09,495
- It's in other boys?
- It's common in adolescent boys.

153
00:14:10,204 --> 00:14:11,622
There he is.

154
00:14:11,789 --> 00:14:13,791
Hi there, Jake.

155
00:14:13,957 --> 00:14:15,250
I'm Jill.

156
00:14:15,417 --> 00:14:18,253
I'm your intake administration supervisor.

157
00:14:19,004 --> 00:14:20,422
This is Toby, our driver.

158
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:22,299
How's it going, young man?

159
00:14:22,466 --> 00:14:23,759
You pack your things?

160
00:14:23,926 --> 00:14:25,803
What exactly do they do at your clinic?

161
00:14:25,969 --> 00:14:29,139
Jake, these guys have been working
with the school for a long time.

162
00:14:29,306 --> 00:14:31,475
No, that's okay, Laurie.
We encourage questions.

163
00:14:31,642 --> 00:14:34,061
It shows spirit and vitality.

164
00:14:34,228 --> 00:14:36,188
He's just a healthy growing boy.

165
00:14:36,355 --> 00:14:38,899
I can assure you that all our tests
are done in a controlled...

166
00:14:39,066 --> 00:14:41,402
...child-friendly environment.

167
00:14:41,568 --> 00:14:43,654
We have experience
with cases like yours.

168
00:14:43,821 --> 00:14:46,949
Night terrors, hallucinations,
odd obsessions.

169
00:14:47,116 --> 00:14:50,285
Our approach is actually very gentle
compared to standard treatments.

170
00:14:50,452 --> 00:14:53,330
I understand your concerns,
but you don't have to worry at all.

171
00:14:55,374 --> 00:14:57,042
Mom, help me pack?

172
00:14:57,209 --> 00:14:58,877
Yeah.

173
00:15:00,212 --> 00:15:01,255
It's two days.

174
00:15:01,422 --> 00:15:05,092
Do you want your ripped jeans
or your regular ones?

175
00:15:05,717 --> 00:15:07,928
- What's wrong?
- Mom, it's them.

176
00:15:08,637 --> 00:15:11,515
- What?
- It's the skin people from my dream.

177
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,189
- Honey, you need to stop this.
- No, you have to listen to me.

178
00:15:19,356 --> 00:15:23,307
What's going on?
He's not human.

179
00:15:23,485 --> 00:15:24,736
- That's not his real face.
- For chrissake.

180
00:15:24,903 --> 00:15:25,988
Shut up, Lon.

181
00:15:26,155 --> 00:15:30,242
You actually hope I'm crazy,
just so you can get me out of here.

182
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:36,415
Mom, you have to believe me.

183
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,794
- Lon, maybe this-—
- Can't you see he's gotten worse?

184
00:15:41,462 --> 00:15:43,130
You're gonna go with them right now.

185
00:15:43,297 --> 00:15:46,800
Or, I swear to God,
I will drag you down the stairs myself.

186
00:15:57,978 --> 00:15:59,438
It's one weekend, kiddo.

187
00:16:00,397 --> 00:16:03,484
If you don't like it,
then I'll come get you.

188
00:16:04,151 --> 00:16:05,444
I promise.

189
00:16:14,912 --> 00:16:16,872
Okay, I'll go.

190
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:22,586
- I love you, Mom.
- I love you too.

191
00:16:38,894 --> 00:16:41,647
I'm just gonna get my toothbrush.

192
00:16:49,363 --> 00:16:51,865
- He's just getting his things.
- He's trying to escape.

193
00:16:52,032 --> 00:16:53,659
Escape?

194
00:16:53,825 --> 00:16:55,327
Jake?

195
00:16:55,494 --> 00:16:56,745
Jake?

196
00:16:56,954 --> 00:16:59,831
Chrissake. Jake? Jake!

197
00:16:59,998 --> 00:17:01,083
Jake!

198
00:17:02,584 --> 00:17:04,753
- Jake!
- Get him.

199
00:17:08,674 --> 00:17:10,676
- Come back here!
- Don't worry.

200
00:17:10,842 --> 00:17:13,095
Toby will get him down safely.

201
00:17:36,702 --> 00:17:38,620
Stop running.

202
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:34,009
- Mom? You okay?
- Where are you?

203
00:18:34,176 --> 00:18:36,511
You can't just run away like that, Jake.

204
00:18:36,678 --> 00:18:38,722
- Please come home.
- Sorry, I can't.

205
00:18:38,889 --> 00:18:40,223
Right now.

206
00:18:41,183 --> 00:18:42,225
Jake ?

207
00:18:42,934 --> 00:18:44,227
I'll call you later.

208
00:18:44,394 --> 00:18:46,271
Love you, Mom.

209
00:20:11,356 --> 00:20:12,858
Greetings, traveler.

210
00:20:13,024 --> 00:20:15,318
Please enter destination.

211
00:20:23,326 --> 00:20:24,578
One, nine.

212
00:20:24,745 --> 00:20:28,248
One, nine, one, nine. Mid-World.

213
00:20:50,896 --> 00:20:54,691
Mid-World. One-way destination.

214
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,196
Let me go!

215
00:21:43,406 --> 00:21:44,491
Stop!

216
00:22:10,976 --> 00:22:12,561
What?

217
00:22:26,283 --> 00:22:27,784
Whoa.

218
00:22:40,255 --> 00:22:42,132
Okay-

219
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:44,384
This is good.

220
00:22:46,094 --> 00:22:47,345
It's all real.

221
00:23:57,207 --> 00:23:59,209
New candidate. Female, age 11.

222
00:24:01,419 --> 00:24:02,754
Looks good.

223
00:24:02,921 --> 00:24:04,631
Arriving!

224
00:24:12,472 --> 00:24:14,224
Welcome back, sir.

225
00:24:16,768 --> 00:24:18,186
Find yourself a face, Rat Boy.

226
00:24:18,353 --> 00:24:20,188
You're in my house.

227
00:24:20,814 --> 00:24:22,273
How was your trip?

228
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,109
Fine. Do we have any new leads?

229
00:24:26,236 --> 00:24:27,278
Got it.

230
00:24:27,445 --> 00:24:28,989
What have you got?

231
00:24:30,031 --> 00:24:31,741
These are all showing promise.

232
00:24:31,908 --> 00:24:34,035
Our trackers are going out to them
as we speak.

233
00:24:34,452 --> 00:24:36,037
There's been a serious breach of-

234
00:24:40,208 --> 00:24:42,002
I'm not fantastic at waiting.

235
00:24:44,504 --> 00:24:46,506
Unauthorized crossing, sir.

236
00:24:46,673 --> 00:24:48,925
One of the old portals on Keystone Earth.

237
00:24:52,387 --> 00:24:53,555
Has that ever happened?

238
00:24:56,558 --> 00:24:58,935
Find me a portal close by.

239
00:25:04,232 --> 00:25:06,151
- Love your mask.
- Sir?

240
00:25:06,317 --> 00:25:09,279
Choose a pretty face
and the world is your oyster.

241
00:25:09,446 --> 00:25:10,864
Aligning, sir.

242
00:26:01,831 --> 00:26:03,249
Who are you?

243
00:26:04,167 --> 00:26:05,794
It's you.

244
00:26:09,047 --> 00:26:10,673
I'm... I'm Jake.

245
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,134
Jake... Jake Chambers.

246
00:26:13,301 --> 00:26:15,720
I dreamt about you.

247
00:26:16,846 --> 00:26:17,889
Please.

248
00:26:20,892 --> 00:26:22,310
Here.

249
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,023
Look.

250
00:26:29,734 --> 00:26:31,653
You're a Gunslinger, right?

251
00:26:39,369 --> 00:26:42,455
There are no Gunslingers. Not anymore.

252
00:26:47,377 --> 00:26:51,089
- But I saw you.
- Your dreams deceived you, boy.

253
00:26:51,256 --> 00:26:53,716
Told you what you want to hear.

254
00:26:55,426 --> 00:26:57,554
I came a long way to find you.

255
00:26:58,221 --> 00:26:59,764
From another world!

256
00:26:59,931 --> 00:27:01,808
Have a nice trip back.

257
00:27:06,229 --> 00:27:08,690
Hey. Wait!

258
00:27:09,691 --> 00:27:11,943
Dude, come on.

259
00:27:12,694 --> 00:27:14,529
Look, I saw you.

260
00:27:14,696 --> 00:27:17,782
There was a battlefield, and you were
fighting the Man in Black. And there...

261
00:27:18,992 --> 00:27:20,451
The Man in Black?

262
00:27:20,618 --> 00:27:22,078
- No, no, no.
- You know him?

263
00:27:22,245 --> 00:27:24,289
- Stop. Please, please, please.
- He sent you.

264
00:27:24,455 --> 00:27:25,623
You're one of his tricks.

265
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:28,042
- No, no, no. I don't know!
- Where is he hiding?!

266
00:27:28,209 --> 00:27:30,420
- Where is he hiding?!
- I don't know, I swear!

267
00:27:30,587 --> 00:27:33,006
I just-— I just saw him in my dreams,
like I saw you!

268
00:27:33,423 --> 00:27:35,550
Your name is Roland, right?

269
00:27:37,886 --> 00:27:39,470
Please.

270
00:27:47,687 --> 00:27:49,105
When did you first see this?

271
00:27:50,106 --> 00:27:51,482
A year ago.

272
00:27:52,525 --> 00:27:55,195
- Who is he?
- He's a sorcerer.

273
00:27:59,949 --> 00:28:03,161
In all your visions, Walter is here?

274
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:06,372
- Uh, yeah.
- In this place?

275
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:07,832
Yeah.

276
00:28:10,084 --> 00:28:11,711
Wait, his name's Walter?

277
00:28:15,131 --> 00:28:18,134
Cool. Yeah, keep it.

278
00:28:28,603 --> 00:28:30,104
I will find you.

279
00:28:32,315 --> 00:28:35,985
There's a tribe beyond that forest.
We'll go there.

280
00:28:38,821 --> 00:28:41,199
They have seers
who will read your visions.

281
00:28:46,162 --> 00:28:47,538
Let's go. Keep Up-

282
00:28:49,332 --> 00:28:50,959
Okay-

283
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:00,468
...I went down the slide.

284
00:29:01,094 --> 00:29:03,721
Then I got water up my nose,
and I went down...

285
00:29:03,888 --> 00:29:05,431
- ...and I couldn't see anything.
- Hate.

286
00:29:05,598 --> 00:29:07,100
Yeah.

287
00:29:09,102 --> 00:29:12,313
Sweetheart? What's wrong?

288
00:29:55,773 --> 00:29:58,526
Walter Padick.
To what do we owe this great honor?

289
00:29:58,693 --> 00:30:01,654
Someone used a portal here,
in your city...

290
00:30:01,821 --> 00:30:03,990
...without your knowledge.

291
00:30:04,574 --> 00:30:07,160
Killed the house demon.

292
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:10,330
Forgive me, sire.

293
00:30:11,122 --> 00:30:13,458
We'll find out who this trespasser is
and where he went.

294
00:30:13,916 --> 00:30:15,835
Already on it.

295
00:30:16,377 --> 00:30:17,754
Now be a good dog.

296
00:30:28,848 --> 00:30:30,058
The blood is human.

297
00:30:31,142 --> 00:30:32,185
BOY-

298
00:30:34,604 --> 00:30:36,272
His Shine is pure.

299
00:30:39,108 --> 00:30:41,736
So that's how he got through.

300
00:30:42,111 --> 00:30:43,821
Sir?

301
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,032
House demons are formidable beings...

302
00:30:46,199 --> 00:30:49,911
...but a truly powerful psychic
could override it.

303
00:30:50,453 --> 00:30:53,748
A boy with the Shine strong enough
to kill a demon?

304
00:30:54,415 --> 00:30:55,708
Jackpot

305
00:30:55,875 --> 00:31:00,046
Sayre, didn't two skins have trouble
with a kid yesterday?

306
00:31:16,604 --> 00:31:17,772
Don't eat that.

307
00:31:18,356 --> 00:31:20,983
Don't want to have to carry you
for the rest of the way.

308
00:31:54,684 --> 00:31:56,269
Roland?

309
00:32:15,663 --> 00:32:16,706
What are they?

310
00:32:16,873 --> 00:32:18,249
Taheen.

311
00:32:18,958 --> 00:32:20,126
They belong to Walter.

312
00:32:20,293 --> 00:32:22,336
Don't run off in the woods. It's not safe.

313
00:32:23,379 --> 00:32:24,922
But you were the one who ran off.

314
00:32:25,506 --> 00:32:26,799
You said you were hungry.

315
00:32:31,137 --> 00:32:32,513
What?

316
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,564
You had theme parks here.

317
00:32:46,235 --> 00:32:49,489
These ancient structures are from
before the world moved on.

318
00:32:49,655 --> 00:32:51,949
No one knows what they are.

319
00:32:52,408 --> 00:32:53,910
They're theme parks.

320
00:32:58,122 --> 00:32:59,165
I saw you fight him.

321
00:33:02,502 --> 00:33:04,003
There was a field
covered with bodies.

322
00:33:11,719 --> 00:33:13,971
That was our final stand.

323
00:33:17,683 --> 00:33:19,852
I lost my father that day.

324
00:33:22,605 --> 00:33:23,689
You saw that?

325
00:33:31,656 --> 00:33:33,533
Was it about the Tower?

326
00:33:35,493 --> 00:33:37,328
The war?

327
00:33:38,746 --> 00:33:40,456
Yes.

328
00:33:42,667 --> 00:33:44,585
Now, eat your rabbit.

329
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:53,678
It's an honor to meet you in person, sir.

330
00:33:53,844 --> 00:33:54,971
What brings you here?

331
00:33:55,137 --> 00:33:56,305
How may we serve him?

332
00:33:56,472 --> 00:33:58,516
Well, I hear you lost a kid.

333
00:34:00,351 --> 00:34:02,144
It... It wasn't our fault.

334
00:34:02,311 --> 00:34:05,773
It was as if the child knew what we were.
We're doing everything we can...

335
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,985
- Name and location.
- It's all in here.

336
00:34:14,615 --> 00:34:17,159
"Jake Chambers."

337
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,956
Now kill...

338
00:34:22,123 --> 00:34:23,332
...each other.

339
00:34:26,294 --> 00:34:28,838
Calm down. Enjoy the show, folks.

340
00:34:29,422 --> 00:34:32,174
You ain't seen nothing yet.

341
00:34:42,268 --> 00:34:43,728
You draw with a good hand.

342
00:34:49,692 --> 00:34:50,943
I don't know what this is.

343
00:34:55,197 --> 00:34:56,240
It's a map.

344
00:34:58,618 --> 00:35:02,079
My father showed me a...
A map like this once.

345
00:35:06,334 --> 00:35:10,880
Inside the circle is your world
and my world...

346
00:35:11,672 --> 00:35:12,923
...many others.

347
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:14,925
No one knows how many.

348
00:35:15,509 --> 00:35:20,014
The Dark Tower stands
at the center of all things.

349
00:35:22,183 --> 00:35:25,144
And it's stood there
from the beginning of time.

350
00:35:25,811 --> 00:35:28,773
And it sends out powerful energy...

351
00:35:28,939 --> 00:35:31,275
...that protects the universe...

352
00:35:31,442 --> 00:35:33,944
...shields us from what's outside.

353
00:35:34,111 --> 00:35:35,696
What do you mean, "outside"?

354
00:35:36,822 --> 00:35:38,115
What's outside the universe?

355
00:35:42,662 --> 00:35:45,247
Outside is endless darkness...

356
00:35:45,414 --> 00:35:49,418
...full of demons trying to get to us.

357
00:35:50,002 --> 00:35:53,881
Walter wants to tear down the Tower
and let them in.

358
00:35:55,174 --> 00:35:57,343
When the Tower falls, he'll rule...

359
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:00,054
...in a world full of monsters.

360
00:36:01,097 --> 00:36:03,057
But you're trying to stop him, aren't you?

361
00:36:04,016 --> 00:36:06,143
To protect the Tower.

362
00:36:07,144 --> 00:36:08,688
I've seen them try to destroy it.

363
00:36:08,854 --> 00:36:11,899
- If we could just get there...
- There is no "we," Jake.

364
00:36:12,066 --> 00:36:14,485
All that matters to me is that I find...

365
00:36:14,652 --> 00:36:17,154
...and kill Walter.

366
00:36:17,822 --> 00:36:19,532
That's it.

367
00:37:02,074 --> 00:37:03,909
Beamquake.

368
00:37:04,368 --> 00:37:05,411
Strong.

369
00:37:06,912 --> 00:37:08,289
Sounds like screams.

370
00:37:17,798 --> 00:37:19,884
They're just like the quakes
we get back home.

371
00:37:20,634 --> 00:37:23,804
Yeah, what happens in one world...

372
00:37:23,971 --> 00:37:25,723
...echoes in others.

373
00:37:26,891 --> 00:37:29,226
Hope my mom's okay.

374
00:37:32,688 --> 00:37:34,899
Try to get some sleep.

375
00:37:37,902 --> 00:37:40,029
That's not happening.

376
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:49,205
Jake.

377
00:37:52,082 --> 00:37:54,418
Jake.

378
00:38:06,305 --> 00:38:07,473
Hey, kiddo.

379
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:12,603
Where are you?

380
00:38:26,784 --> 00:38:29,411
Everyone who walks with you dies.

381
00:38:40,089 --> 00:38:41,131
Jake.

382
00:38:56,856 --> 00:38:57,940
Hey, kiddo.

383
00:38:59,942 --> 00:39:01,735
Dad?

384
00:39:02,695 --> 00:39:04,822
Long time.

385
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:10,160
It's good to see you, man. You got tall.

386
00:39:10,786 --> 00:39:12,830
This isn't real.

387
00:39:13,956 --> 00:39:15,791
- You're...
- Dead?

388
00:39:15,958 --> 00:39:17,918
Not here.

389
00:39:19,795 --> 00:39:21,255
I missed you.

390
00:39:21,422 --> 00:39:23,299
I missed you too, kiddo.

391
00:39:24,133 --> 00:39:25,342
Come on.

392
00:39:25,509 --> 00:39:26,719
It's okay.

393
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,224
Let's go home.

394
00:39:38,188 --> 00:39:39,398
No.

395
00:39:43,861 --> 00:39:45,738
Darkness and fire.

396
00:39:50,743 --> 00:39:52,202
Jake!

397
00:39:52,578 --> 00:39:54,163
Get away from it!

398
00:40:12,514 --> 00:40:15,184
Roland. My son.

399
00:40:17,227 --> 00:40:18,270
Come with me.

400
00:40:26,445 --> 00:40:27,446
It's okay.

401
00:40:27,613 --> 00:40:29,448
It's gone.

402
00:40:31,742 --> 00:40:33,285
My dad was in there.

403
00:40:34,244 --> 00:40:36,580
No, they sense your weakness...

404
00:40:36,747 --> 00:40:39,291
...create illusions to distract you.

405
00:40:40,334 --> 00:40:42,711
That wasn't anybody you know.

406
00:40:43,921 --> 00:40:45,506
I'm sorry.

407
00:40:50,594 --> 00:40:52,888
That was just a small tear.

408
00:40:53,055 --> 00:40:56,058
They happen after every attack
on the Tower.

409
00:40:56,225 --> 00:41:00,062
Those things, they're what's coming
if the Tower falls, aren't they?

410
00:41:00,229 --> 00:41:01,271
Yes.

411
00:41:01,438 --> 00:41:04,149
But if we find that place where
they're keeping the kids, we could-

412
00:41:04,358 --> 00:41:06,276
- Shh, shh, shh.
- What?

413
00:41:06,443 --> 00:41:08,112
Something got out.

414
00:41:16,954 --> 00:41:18,789
Run! Jake, run!

415
00:42:44,333 --> 00:42:46,293
You're gonna need help.

416
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:48,003
I've hurt worse.

417
00:42:48,629 --> 00:42:50,380
But you're bleeding.

418
00:42:50,547 --> 00:42:53,008
I heal fast.

419
00:42:55,344 --> 00:42:57,554
You handled yourself well.

420
00:42:57,721 --> 00:43:00,349
That was brave, going for the gun.

421
00:43:03,811 --> 00:43:05,270
They're gonna find him, Laurie.

422
00:43:05,646 --> 00:43:08,816
We filled out every form.
They have his picture.

423
00:43:20,994 --> 00:43:23,288
I hope you don't mind me
making myself at home.

424
00:43:23,455 --> 00:43:25,499
Where I come from,
we don't have chicken.

425
00:43:25,666 --> 00:43:28,210
- Who the hell are you?
- Oh, you know me, Lon.

426
00:43:28,377 --> 00:43:30,129
You're the one that called me here.

427
00:43:30,295 --> 00:43:31,338
Not by the telephone...

428
00:43:31,505 --> 00:43:34,550
...but with your every desire
to get rid of the brat...

429
00:43:34,716 --> 00:43:37,427
...all in the hopes that Mommy there
might love you best.

430
00:43:39,221 --> 00:43:41,640
But you'll always be a seat-filler, Lon.

431
00:43:42,266 --> 00:43:44,184
- You get out of here right now.
- Lon.

432
00:43:46,019 --> 00:43:47,938
It's the man from Jake's drawings.

433
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:52,776
Drawings?

434
00:43:55,737 --> 00:43:56,947
Stop breathing.

435
00:43:58,157 --> 00:43:59,741
- Aah!
- Quiet.

436
00:44:02,911 --> 00:44:04,288
Drawings.

437
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,590
Show me.

438
00:44:44,786 --> 00:44:49,208
Well, it looks like I've
got myself a stalker.

439
00:45:05,724 --> 00:45:07,601
Gunslinger.

440
00:45:22,282 --> 00:45:25,410
This son of yours is quite special,
isn't he?

441
00:45:37,631 --> 00:45:41,134
The guilt you must feel...

442
00:45:42,636 --> 00:45:44,888
...not believing in him.

443
00:45:46,348 --> 00:45:49,810
And you sent your only child off
to the asylum.

444
00:45:53,188 --> 00:45:55,315
Shame...

445
00:45:56,316 --> 00:45:58,318
...on you.

446
00:46:58,712 --> 00:46:59,880
Stranger approaching!

447
00:47:03,925 --> 00:47:05,552
Gather round!

448
00:47:10,015 --> 00:47:12,392
Long days, pleasant nights.

449
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:14,519
May you have twice that number.

450
00:47:15,103 --> 00:47:18,607
I haven't seen one of your kind
since I was a young man.

451
00:47:19,066 --> 00:47:20,567
Seeing you here, alive-

452
00:47:20,734 --> 00:47:22,652
Who's your strongest seer?

453
00:47:23,236 --> 00:47:24,363
That would be me.

454
00:47:25,572 --> 00:47:26,907
I'm Arra.

455
00:47:27,908 --> 00:47:30,410
The boy here has visions of this place.

456
00:47:31,953 --> 00:47:34,164
I need to know where it is.

457
00:47:37,709 --> 00:47:40,128
The Man in Black.

458
00:47:40,295 --> 00:47:42,464
We managed to do
some serious damage, sir...

459
00:47:42,631 --> 00:47:44,549
- ...but it didn't fall.
- None of that matters.

460
00:47:44,716 --> 00:47:47,469
I found the one. This kid's going to
bring down the Tower...

461
00:47:47,677 --> 00:47:50,055
...all by his lonesome.

462
00:47:50,514 --> 00:47:52,682
- Where is this child?
- He's here...

463
00:47:52,849 --> 00:47:54,476
...on Mid-World...

464
00:47:54,643 --> 00:47:58,313
...looking for an old friend of mine,
Roland of Eld.

465
00:47:59,272 --> 00:48:01,566
Wait, I thought
all the Gunslingers were dead.

466
00:48:02,317 --> 00:48:04,236
Roland's always had
an annoying ability...

467
00:48:04,403 --> 00:48:06,405
...to resist my magics.

468
00:48:06,571 --> 00:48:08,657
So I killed everyone he ever cared about.

469
00:48:09,574 --> 00:48:12,285
Last I heard, he was roaming
the Mohaine aimlessly.

470
00:48:12,452 --> 00:48:14,788
- That's where the boy is going.
- Mohaine Desert? Isn't that...?

471
00:48:14,955 --> 00:48:17,374
Vast. Yes. And so is this boy's Shine.

472
00:48:17,541 --> 00:48:20,460
I'll send our trackers in the region, sir.

473
00:48:32,013 --> 00:48:33,432
This will get worse.

474
00:48:33,598 --> 00:48:36,435
I don't have anything
that can help with that.

475
00:48:36,601 --> 00:48:38,228
You need to rest, let it heal.

476
00:48:38,895 --> 00:48:40,605
I'll be fine.

477
00:48:43,275 --> 00:48:44,401
Thankee, Sai.

478
00:48:44,568 --> 00:48:46,736
You've come all the way
from Keystone Earth to find him.

479
00:48:49,406 --> 00:48:52,117
His Shine is beyond anything
I've ever seen.

480
00:48:53,827 --> 00:48:54,953
Shine?

481
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,288
Psychic powers.

482
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,249
Very few are born with this gift.

483
00:48:59,416 --> 00:49:03,462
Often, the power is so slight,
people don't even know they have it.

484
00:49:04,254 --> 00:49:07,841
Your Shine burns so brightly, Jake.

485
00:49:08,008 --> 00:49:11,928
You have potential
I can't even begin to understand.

486
00:49:12,095 --> 00:49:13,263
Whoa.

487
00:49:15,765 --> 00:49:17,601
Her voice was in my head.

488
00:49:17,767 --> 00:49:20,520
Your gift is extraordinary, Jake.

489
00:49:20,687 --> 00:49:23,899
It made you see across worlds.

490
00:49:25,484 --> 00:49:26,943
The drawing.

491
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:28,528
What about the drawing?

492
00:49:31,865 --> 00:49:34,034
Concentrate.

493
00:49:34,201 --> 00:49:36,953
Share your visions with me.

494
00:49:44,085 --> 00:49:45,712
Open up.

495
00:49:47,714 --> 00:49:49,591
Show me.

496
00:49:55,805 --> 00:49:57,265
The Man in Black...

497
00:49:57,432 --> 00:49:58,642
Jake.

498
00:49:59,434 --> 00:50:00,727
Fled across the desert.

499
00:50:04,105 --> 00:50:06,024
Tell me.

500
00:50:06,358 --> 00:50:07,859
Where is he?

501
00:50:09,402 --> 00:50:10,779
Northern Wastelands.

502
00:50:15,408 --> 00:50:17,827
That's more than six months of travel.

503
00:50:19,788 --> 00:50:21,748
But you can get me there faster than that.

504
00:50:21,915 --> 00:50:24,751
The Man in Black and his men
keep track of all portal travel.

505
00:50:24,918 --> 00:50:27,754
- I need to get there.
- Portals.

506
00:50:27,921 --> 00:50:30,173
We couldn't help you,
even if we wanted to.

507
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:34,010
The only way to access their territories
is from one of their own bases.

508
00:50:36,388 --> 00:50:38,515
Then I'll make it on foot.

509
00:50:39,182 --> 00:50:40,392
Wait.

510
00:50:42,018 --> 00:50:44,187
The fake-skins...

511
00:50:44,938 --> 00:50:47,232
...they take kids
from different worlds, right?

512
00:50:47,399 --> 00:50:48,942
They tried to take me from New York.

513
00:50:49,109 --> 00:50:52,195
- Doesn't that mean that they-?
- They have a base there.

514
00:50:52,821 --> 00:50:56,074
With a portal that can take me
right to this place.

515
00:50:58,785 --> 00:51:01,246
You're gonna send us to Keystone Earth.

516
00:51:11,506 --> 00:51:13,633
We're diverting power to the generators.

517
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,844
The portal will be ready shortly.

518
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:20,890
Do they have guns in your world?

519
00:51:22,142 --> 00:51:23,184
Yeah.

520
00:51:24,311 --> 00:51:27,147
And bullets, are they as rare
as they are here?

521
00:51:28,315 --> 00:51:30,358
You're gonna like Earth. A lot.

522
00:51:36,865 --> 00:51:40,744
We agreed we'd never use the portal
unless the village was in danger.

523
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:42,704
They will find out we have it and come.

524
00:51:42,871 --> 00:51:46,041
We can't disobey a Gunslinger.
It's the law.

525
00:51:46,207 --> 00:51:48,835
- How do you know what he is?
- Arra.

526
00:51:49,002 --> 00:51:50,211
You must have read him.

527
00:51:50,837 --> 00:51:52,881
What do you see?

528
00:51:56,217 --> 00:51:58,678
He's Roland of Gilead.

529
00:51:58,845 --> 00:52:00,347
Last of the line of Eld.

530
00:52:05,894 --> 00:52:09,272
But the Man in Black has
his soul in his pocket...

531
00:52:09,814 --> 00:52:13,526
...and his heart's consumed
by vengeance.

532
00:52:14,361 --> 00:52:15,945
He's not a Gunslinger.

533
00:52:16,988 --> 00:52:18,907
Not anymore.

534
00:52:20,617 --> 00:52:22,160
Or would you tell us differently?

535
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:26,206
Only a goat would lie to a seer.

536
00:52:26,373 --> 00:52:28,458
You dishonor your ancestors.

537
00:52:28,625 --> 00:52:30,919
The Gunslingers have sworn an oath
to defend the Tower...

538
00:52:31,086 --> 00:52:32,754
Look around you.

539
00:52:34,047 --> 00:52:35,465
The war is over, and we lost.

540
00:52:38,551 --> 00:52:42,472
If you left your little haven,
you would see that for yourself.

541
00:52:43,223 --> 00:52:45,934
The darkness is everywhere...

542
00:52:46,101 --> 00:52:48,311
...and trying to fight against it
accomplishes nothing.

543
00:52:50,313 --> 00:52:53,483
I was fighting to defend the Tower
before most of you were even born.

544
00:52:54,401 --> 00:52:55,902
There's always a battle.

545
00:52:56,069 --> 00:52:57,612
Always.

546
00:52:58,071 --> 00:52:59,280
But no more.

547
00:53:00,699 --> 00:53:02,659
Isn't that why we're losing?

548
00:53:02,826 --> 00:53:05,578
Because everyone stopped believing.

549
00:53:05,745 --> 00:53:10,709
As long as the darkness is out there,
the Tower will fall.

550
00:53:11,376 --> 00:53:14,462
And before that happens,
I will get my revenge.

551
00:53:33,022 --> 00:53:34,107
Look.

552
00:53:35,024 --> 00:53:36,234
He saved my life.

553
00:53:38,236 --> 00:53:40,321
And he doesn't even like me that much.

554
00:53:43,283 --> 00:53:44,909
He's still a Gunslinger.

555
00:53:45,952 --> 00:53:47,954
I know he is.

556
00:53:51,499 --> 00:53:53,710
Should be ready anytime now.

557
00:53:53,877 --> 00:53:55,545
As soon as it aligns, it should open...

558
00:53:55,712 --> 00:53:57,922
...in an unobstructed area in your city...

559
00:53:58,089 --> 00:54:00,049
...on your version of Earth.

560
00:54:00,216 --> 00:54:01,509
"Should"?

561
00:54:01,676 --> 00:54:03,136
Technology's very old.

562
00:54:03,303 --> 00:54:05,889
Remember that number.
It's your way back here.

563
00:54:06,347 --> 00:54:07,474
Got it.

564
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,184
Been there.

565
00:54:14,898 --> 00:54:15,940
Hey.

566
00:54:16,775 --> 00:54:18,651
You Okay?

567
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,658
What's wrong?

568
00:54:54,437 --> 00:54:56,523
We're losing power.

569
00:55:00,401 --> 00:55:02,445
Sir, they're in the village.

570
00:55:16,334 --> 00:55:18,962
Oh, no. Faras.

571
00:55:19,128 --> 00:55:21,548
- Can you fix it?
- We have spare parts in the village.

572
00:55:25,093 --> 00:55:28,346
Jake, go find somewhere
close to hide, understand?

573
00:55:28,847 --> 00:55:29,889
Yeah.

574
00:55:46,489 --> 00:55:47,574
Come on!

575
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:49,075
Get inside!

576
00:55:49,242 --> 00:55:51,828
- We need to go! Hurry!
- Are you okay?

577
00:55:54,247 --> 00:55:55,498
Go get weapons!

578
00:55:56,875 --> 00:55:58,459
Which way?

579
00:55:58,626 --> 00:56:00,461
In there.

580
00:56:01,546 --> 00:56:02,839
He's there.

581
00:56:04,465 --> 00:56:05,800
He's hurt.

582
00:56:05,967 --> 00:56:08,386
My child! Please!

583
00:56:10,179 --> 00:56:12,348
His guns are forged from the steel...

584
00:56:12,515 --> 00:56:14,893
...of the sword of Arthur Eld himself.

585
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,856
I believe Keystoners call it Excalibur.

586
00:56:27,822 --> 00:56:30,533
Please, just go!

587
00:56:33,036 --> 00:56:35,580
Just get help, please!

588
00:56:41,669 --> 00:56:43,671
- We have to get out of here.
- No, I've got to get them out!

589
00:56:43,838 --> 00:56:45,840
No, no, please, we have to go!

590
00:56:46,549 --> 00:56:48,635
- Ahh!
- Run.

591
00:56:51,137 --> 00:56:53,348
Let's go! WOMAN: Help!

592
00:56:53,514 --> 00:56:54,974
Go get the parts.

593
00:56:55,141 --> 00:56:56,267
Dad!

594
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:07,278
They were after our boy.

595
00:57:07,445 --> 00:57:08,863
Why would they want our boy?

596
00:57:44,941 --> 00:57:45,984
Right.

597
00:57:47,527 --> 00:57:49,445
- Turn on the water pumps.
- Right away, sir.

598
00:57:49,612 --> 00:57:51,239
- No!
- Let's try to get them out!

599
00:57:52,699 --> 00:57:55,410
- Okay, I'll take care of you!
- All right.

600
00:57:55,576 --> 00:57:58,204
There you are. All right?

601
00:57:58,371 --> 00:57:59,956
Come this way.

602
00:58:15,013 --> 00:58:17,724
You couldn't save him, Roland.

603
00:58:23,688 --> 00:58:24,939
Sir, Shine.

604
00:58:25,106 --> 00:58:26,816
That's the boy. Get him.

605
00:58:32,822 --> 00:58:34,240
Jake.

606
00:58:44,625 --> 00:58:45,835
Jake.

607
00:58:46,002 --> 00:58:48,671
- They're here for him.
- I know.

608
00:58:53,217 --> 00:58:54,761
Roland.

609
00:58:55,595 --> 00:58:58,222
- What are you doing?
- Quiet.

610
00:59:26,834 --> 00:59:30,379
Roland. Please. Help me, please.

611
01:00:11,003 --> 01:00:12,171
Let's go! Let's go!

612
01:00:12,338 --> 01:00:13,840
We need to leave.

613
01:00:14,006 --> 01:00:15,216
He's not safe here.

614
01:00:15,383 --> 01:00:18,052
And as long as he's here,
you aren't either.

615
01:00:18,219 --> 01:00:19,303
We have this fight.

616
01:00:20,429 --> 01:00:22,765
- Come on.
- Go.

617
01:00:23,724 --> 01:00:24,767
Jake.

618
01:00:24,934 --> 01:00:27,228
Be careful using the Shine.
They're tracking you.

619
01:00:29,897 --> 01:00:31,607
Portal alignment complete.

620
01:00:31,774 --> 01:00:33,025
Come on.

621
01:00:37,905 --> 01:00:39,740
No, it's not ready yet.

622
01:00:51,085 --> 01:00:52,712
- Knife.
- He's a chef.

623
01:00:53,296 --> 01:00:54,922
Come on.

624
01:01:05,558 --> 01:01:07,977
So many people.

625
01:01:15,526 --> 01:01:18,863
We need to get you help. Right now.

626
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:27,622
They had a portal.

627
01:01:28,915 --> 01:01:30,499
I think they're gone.

628
01:01:47,058 --> 01:01:48,935
Get me the coordinates.

629
01:01:52,813 --> 01:01:56,692
One last time around the wheel,
old friend.

630
01:02:01,197 --> 01:02:02,823
This is madness.

631
01:02:02,990 --> 01:02:05,493
You can't walk
into a hospital here carrying guns.

632
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:07,828
Trust me. Come on.

633
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:13,000
Let me do all the talking.

634
01:02:16,462 --> 01:02:18,297
Hi.
You've reached Laurie, Lon and Jake.

635
01:02:18,464 --> 01:02:19,799
Please leave a detailed message...

636
01:02:19,966 --> 01:02:22,635
...and we'll get back to you
as soon as possible.

637
01:02:22,802 --> 01:02:24,595
This is awful. Try it.

638
01:02:24,762 --> 01:02:27,306
- That looks gross. What is it?
- You got to try it. It's terrible.

639
01:02:27,473 --> 01:02:30,309
- I don't want to try it if it's terrible.
- It's like mango...

640
01:02:30,476 --> 01:02:33,187
Do the animals here still speak?

641
01:02:33,354 --> 01:02:36,399
What? No, that's a commercial.

642
01:02:40,278 --> 01:02:42,113
Wait, what do you mean by "still"?

643
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:44,031
He's in here.

644
01:02:44,198 --> 01:02:45,449
Mr. Deschain.

645
01:02:46,450 --> 01:02:48,369
I see the antibiotics are kicking in.

646
01:02:48,536 --> 01:02:51,455
On a scale of one to 10,
how bad is your pain?

647
01:02:53,374 --> 01:02:54,792
Okay-

648
01:02:54,959 --> 01:02:57,336
You were in very bad shape.

649
01:02:57,503 --> 01:02:59,297
I'm surprised you're even sitting up.

650
01:02:59,463 --> 01:03:00,923
I'm stronger than most.

651
01:03:02,925 --> 01:03:04,427
We get that sentiment a lot.

652
01:03:04,593 --> 01:03:07,513
So aside from your infection
and the wound from the...

653
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,682
...costume-party incident...

654
01:03:09,849 --> 01:03:14,186
...we also found traces
of hepatitis A, B, E, and...

655
01:03:16,272 --> 01:03:18,399
...chronic radiation sickness.

656
01:03:20,526 --> 01:03:23,070
Have you traveled overseas
in the past couple of months?

657
01:03:28,367 --> 01:03:31,871
No. I've been here on Keystone Earth.

658
01:03:35,499 --> 01:03:36,876
So am I cured or not?

659
01:03:37,043 --> 01:03:39,170
We're going to keep you here
for the night to monitor your progress.

660
01:03:39,337 --> 01:03:41,714
Maybe tomorrow afternoon-
What are you doing? No.

661
01:03:41,881 --> 01:03:43,549
- I can't stay here.
- You need to get back on that.

662
01:03:43,716 --> 01:03:45,551
- Mr. Deschain, you need-
- For your services.

663
01:03:45,718 --> 01:03:47,553
- Wait, what?
- May your days be long.

664
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:49,305
But you need to get back on that.

665
01:03:49,472 --> 01:03:51,015
- Mr. Deschain?
- Bring my guns.

666
01:03:52,808 --> 01:03:54,685
These are painkillers and vitamins.

667
01:03:56,937 --> 01:03:59,774
You only want to take one or two at a...

668
01:04:00,816 --> 01:04:03,277
...time. WOMAN: Hey, cutie.

669
01:04:03,444 --> 01:04:04,779
Can we join the party?

670
01:04:06,489 --> 01:04:09,408
You have both forgotten
the faces of your fathers.

671
01:04:11,535 --> 01:04:13,537
You probably shouldn't talk
to people here.

672
01:04:23,798 --> 01:04:25,466
What is this?

673
01:04:26,133 --> 01:04:27,176
Sugar.

674
01:04:28,969 --> 01:04:32,139
How we gonna find the portal?
New York's a pretty big place.

675
01:04:32,306 --> 01:04:33,516
I don't know.

676
01:04:33,682 --> 01:04:37,228
I just can't let Walter know
how I'm coming for him.

677
01:04:45,861 --> 01:04:47,696
I've got an idea.

678
01:04:50,699 --> 01:04:53,953
These painkillers work fast.

679
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:56,080
I haven't felt this good in years.

680
01:04:56,247 --> 01:04:57,998
Yeah, we got the good stuff.

681
01:04:58,374 --> 01:05:01,127
Got any more of that sugar?

682
01:05:02,461 --> 01:05:04,296
There's nothing to be scared of.

683
01:05:04,672 --> 01:05:07,091
I promise you, whatever happens...

684
01:05:07,258 --> 01:05:09,260
...you'll be at peace.

685
01:05:09,427 --> 01:05:12,430
- You'll be...
- A seer who lies.

686
01:05:14,598 --> 01:05:15,683
The worst kind.

687
01:05:17,852 --> 01:05:20,062
I like you already.

688
01:05:21,355 --> 01:05:22,940
Come now.

689
01:05:24,608 --> 01:05:25,776
Good bye.

690
01:05:27,862 --> 01:05:29,238
Talk.

691
01:05:31,282 --> 01:05:32,825
Shh.

692
01:05:33,451 --> 01:05:37,079
Don't fight it. Where did he take the boy?

693
01:05:38,789 --> 01:05:39,832
Jake?

694
01:05:39,999 --> 01:05:42,042
Chambers, yes. Where?

695
01:05:47,047 --> 01:05:50,718
- Key... Key...
- Keystone Earth.

696
01:05:50,885 --> 01:05:51,927
Thank you.

697
01:06:01,896 --> 01:06:04,064
Hey, remember me?

698
01:06:07,526 --> 01:06:09,487
You said they were crossing over kids.

699
01:06:11,197 --> 01:06:12,781
You were one of them, weren't you?

700
01:06:13,616 --> 01:06:16,494
I lost it. The Shine.

701
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:18,871
Which way did they take you through?

702
01:06:19,038 --> 01:06:21,916
- No, no, you have to run.
- Do you remember? A portal, a door.

703
01:06:22,082 --> 01:06:23,959
- Anything, please.
- It's almost over.

704
01:06:24,126 --> 01:06:25,336
It's almost over.

705
01:06:25,503 --> 01:06:27,296
It's almost over. It's almost over.

706
01:06:27,463 --> 01:06:29,924
Can you hear me?

707
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:31,884
Remember. Show me.

708
01:06:35,554 --> 01:06:36,597
Dixie.

709
01:06:36,764 --> 01:06:38,015
Jake!

710
01:06:39,183 --> 01:06:40,893
Jake!

711
01:06:42,061 --> 01:06:44,188
They can track the Shine.

712
01:06:44,355 --> 01:06:45,898
Okay?

713
01:06:48,943 --> 01:06:51,320
I know what you are.

714
01:06:52,655 --> 01:06:54,615
Gunslinger.

715
01:06:55,699 --> 01:06:57,368
Go.

716
01:07:02,414 --> 01:07:05,584
Should have enough to find it.
Got to get home and do some research.

717
01:07:05,751 --> 01:07:09,171
- Your home?
- Yeah, I got to let my mom know I'm okay.

718
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:11,882
We have trackers spread
throughout the city.

719
01:07:12,049 --> 01:07:13,592
There's no trace of him yet, sir.

720
01:07:13,759 --> 01:07:15,886
Couple of small spikes,
but not enough to hone in on.

721
01:07:16,053 --> 01:07:17,263
Don't you worry, Dicky-boy.

722
01:07:17,429 --> 01:07:19,139
- I've got you covered.
- Sir?

723
01:07:19,306 --> 01:07:22,476
I left a surprise for our little friend.
Just be ready.

724
01:07:22,643 --> 01:07:25,396
- You should probably wait here.
- Dude.

725
01:07:25,563 --> 01:07:27,648
- Where the hell have you been?
- Timmy. Um...

726
01:07:27,815 --> 01:07:28,941
Who's that?

727
01:07:30,442 --> 01:07:31,735
I'll tell you later.

728
01:07:31,902 --> 01:07:34,321
How's Mom and Lon?
They must be freaking out.

729
01:07:34,613 --> 01:07:36,407
They haven't been home
since yesterday.

730
01:07:39,368 --> 01:07:40,911
Mom.Mom.

731
01:07:51,589 --> 01:07:52,631
- Mom?
- Jake.

732
01:07:52,798 --> 01:07:54,091
- Mom? Mom! Mom!
- Jake!

733
01:07:57,845 --> 01:07:59,305
No.

734
01:07:59,763 --> 01:08:00,806
No, no.

735
01:08:00,973 --> 01:08:04,768
No, no. No, no, no.

736
01:08:05,811 --> 01:08:07,146
No, no, no.

737
01:08:07,813 --> 01:08:09,648
No, Mom. No, no, no.

738
01:08:11,150 --> 01:08:12,484
No, no, Mom.

739
01:08:21,118 --> 01:08:22,536
No.

740
01:08:23,579 --> 01:08:25,164
No, no, Mom.

741
01:08:25,331 --> 01:08:26,624
- Drawings.
- Mom.

742
01:08:26,790 --> 01:08:27,958
I'll make it quick.

743
01:08:28,834 --> 01:08:29,877
Jake!

744
01:08:33,213 --> 01:08:34,548
No.

745
01:08:34,715 --> 01:08:36,008
No, Jake.

746
01:08:36,383 --> 01:08:38,260
- Don't see it.
- Mom.

747
01:08:38,427 --> 01:08:40,638
It's what he wants.

748
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:44,350
- He's tracking you.
- She's dead.

749
01:08:44,516 --> 01:08:45,643
Close your mind.

750
01:08:46,477 --> 01:08:49,271
Close your mind.
Let the pain run through you, Jake.

751
01:08:50,397 --> 01:08:51,440
He killed her.

752
01:08:52,191 --> 01:08:54,276
- I know. I know.
- He killed her.

753
01:08:58,614 --> 01:09:00,115
Come here.

754
01:09:30,688 --> 01:09:32,898
I will kill him.

755
01:09:34,483 --> 01:09:35,734
For both of us.

756
01:09:43,534 --> 01:09:45,661
What about the Tower?

757
01:09:51,083 --> 01:09:54,795
My mom died
so you could have your revenge?

758
01:09:59,049 --> 01:10:01,719
Maybe your world is almost gone,
but mine isn't.

759
01:10:01,885 --> 01:10:04,680
You said it yourself, as long
as the darkness is out there...

760
01:10:04,847 --> 01:10:07,349
...the Tower's always in danger.

761
01:10:11,103 --> 01:10:13,147
You know, they were right.

762
01:10:16,108 --> 01:10:18,277
You're not a Gunslinger.

763
01:10:23,031 --> 01:10:24,074
Here.

764
01:10:24,241 --> 01:10:26,493
It's called the Dixie Pig.

765
01:10:26,785 --> 01:10:28,287
It's on Plymouth and Pearl.

766
01:10:44,219 --> 01:10:46,305
When I was younger...

767
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:50,893
...I would recite the Gunslinger's Creed.

768
01:10:53,562 --> 01:10:56,023
It calms the heart and the mind.

769
01:10:57,733 --> 01:11:00,194
I haven't spoken it for years.

770
01:11:23,509 --> 01:11:26,053
I do not aim with my hand.

771
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:30,265
He who aims with his hand
has forgotten the face of his father.

772
01:11:31,767 --> 01:11:33,268
I aim with my eye.

773
01:11:36,438 --> 01:11:39,024
I do not shoot with my hand.

774
01:11:39,191 --> 01:11:43,153
He who shoots with his hand
has forgotten the face of his father.

775
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:45,322
I shoot with my mind.

776
01:11:58,293 --> 01:12:00,254
I do not kill with my gun.

777
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:03,924
BOTH He who kills with his
gun has forgotten the face of his father.

778
01:12:04,383 --> 01:12:06,343
Not while the Tower still stands.

779
01:12:06,510 --> 01:12:07,719
Not while you still stand.

780
01:12:07,886 --> 01:12:10,013
- I kill with my heart.
- I kill with my heart.

781
01:12:20,148 --> 01:12:21,984
That's good.

782
01:12:22,818 --> 01:12:24,611
Your Shine is your weapon, Jake.

783
01:12:27,155 --> 01:12:29,157
Guns are mine.

784
01:12:45,632 --> 01:12:47,801
Can I help you fellas?

785
01:12:48,677 --> 01:12:50,804
- Hey.
- Forty-five-caliber bullets.

786
01:12:51,013 --> 01:12:52,055
Uh...

787
01:12:52,264 --> 01:12:54,516
- I only have...
- We'll take them all.

788
01:12:54,683 --> 01:12:56,560
Just do what he says. He won't hurt you.

789
01:12:56,727 --> 01:12:57,978
I don't want any trouble.

790
01:12:58,645 --> 01:13:00,314
Well, then you're smarter than most.

791
01:13:00,689 --> 01:13:01,982
Hurry Up-

792
01:13:13,410 --> 01:13:15,370
All right, let's get you somewhere safe.

793
01:13:16,246 --> 01:13:17,873
Gunslinger.

794
01:13:20,792 --> 01:13:22,419
Did you miss me?

795
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:27,758
Well, I guess you did.

796
01:13:27,925 --> 01:13:29,718
Roland! Roland, Roland.

797
01:13:29,885 --> 01:13:31,136
Jake, run.

798
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:32,763
Run!

799
01:13:42,314 --> 01:13:46,151
I see you finally found a compass,
yet you still came to me.

800
01:13:47,027 --> 01:13:49,071
Because I'm your only destination,
Roland.

801
01:13:51,239 --> 01:13:52,574
Fire away.

802
01:13:54,576 --> 01:13:56,495
It's not me. I'm not doing this.

803
01:13:59,831 --> 01:14:01,708
First, you want to save the Tower.

804
01:14:03,168 --> 01:14:04,878
Then, kill the Man in Black.

805
01:14:09,257 --> 01:14:12,427
You are like a dog
fetching a stick over and over.

806
01:14:12,594 --> 01:14:15,097
You tell the kid
what happened to the old crew?

807
01:14:15,263 --> 01:14:18,767
You tell him that everyone that
walks with you dies by my hand?

808
01:14:18,934 --> 01:14:20,185
Not this time.

809
01:14:20,352 --> 01:14:22,145
Your soft-skinned mother?

810
01:14:22,312 --> 01:14:24,231
- Your Gunslinger friends?
- Face me.

811
01:14:24,398 --> 01:14:25,983
Your whimpering excuse for a dad.

812
01:14:26,149 --> 01:14:29,611
Stop hiding behind your magic
and face me, Walter!

813
01:14:31,530 --> 01:14:34,491
We both know that no matter
who crosses the finish line first...

814
01:14:34,658 --> 01:14:37,661
...the universe will die out eventually.

815
01:14:38,161 --> 01:14:40,414
Death always wins.

816
01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:42,290
That's the deal.

817
01:14:50,674 --> 01:14:52,384
No, no.

818
01:14:54,970 --> 01:14:56,013
Roland.

819
01:14:56,847 --> 01:14:58,515
Roland.

820
01:15:20,162 --> 01:15:22,581
Yeah!

821
01:15:30,130 --> 01:15:33,050
Jake Chambers.

822
01:15:40,515 --> 01:15:45,062
You are the full package, as advertised.

823
01:15:47,397 --> 01:15:49,858
Sayre, get ready.

824
01:15:50,025 --> 01:15:53,070
Tall, dark and handsome
is about to crash the party.

825
01:16:13,799 --> 01:16:15,967
Let's go, let's go! Move, move!

826
01:16:16,134 --> 01:16:17,219
Take one and go.

827
01:16:22,682 --> 01:16:26,561
Alrighty. Let's go put everyone
out of their misery, shall we?

828
01:16:26,728 --> 01:16:28,313
Any time, champ.

829
01:16:46,289 --> 01:16:47,624
Roland.

830
01:16:55,507 --> 01:16:57,050
Roland...

831
01:16:57,217 --> 01:16:59,010
...they're taking me to that place.

832
01:16:59,177 --> 01:17:00,679
Be careful.

833
01:17:00,846 --> 01:17:02,013
Hang on.

834
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:03,598
I'm coming for you.

835
01:17:18,572 --> 01:17:20,073
We'll get him, sir.

836
01:17:20,448 --> 01:17:21,658
Bye.

837
01:17:24,077 --> 01:17:26,163
Have a great apocalypse.

838
01:17:28,707 --> 01:17:30,500
Close in on him!

839
01:17:34,171 --> 01:17:35,672
Okay-

840
01:17:50,770 --> 01:17:51,980
Let's go. MAN: Sir.

841
01:17:52,147 --> 01:17:54,024
We're online!

842
01:18:02,908 --> 01:18:06,411
- It's really gonna happen, isn't it?
- Oh, yes, it is.

843
01:19:23,029 --> 01:19:25,073
Something's wrong.

844
01:19:26,366 --> 01:19:30,036
Something's wrong here.
The levels are plateauing.

845
01:19:30,203 --> 01:19:32,205
- It's as if he's...
- Fighting back.

846
01:19:34,374 --> 01:19:36,626
Why do you resist?

847
01:19:36,793 --> 01:19:39,004
Your visions didn't bring you to him,
they brought you to me.

848
01:19:39,921 --> 01:19:41,715
He doesn't love you.
He doesn't care for you.

849
01:19:41,881 --> 01:19:45,218
In fact, he's been using you
this entire time to get to me.

850
01:19:45,385 --> 01:19:48,513
This is why you're here.
This is your destiny.

851
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:50,682
You killed my mom!

852
01:19:50,849 --> 01:19:52,809
Yes, that's it. There we go.

853
01:20:52,243 --> 01:20:53,953
Portal. Close it.

854
01:20:56,748 --> 01:20:58,666
- Close it!
- I can't!

855
01:21:00,794 --> 01:21:02,170
Wait.

856
01:21:04,297 --> 01:21:06,716
Oh, my God. It's the kid.

857
01:21:06,883 --> 01:21:09,719
It's the kid!
He's keeping the portal open!

858
01:21:11,096 --> 01:21:13,515
Ahh. Impressive.

859
01:21:20,397 --> 01:21:22,315
So you wanted me to face you,
old friend?

860
01:21:24,776 --> 01:21:26,027
Here I am.

861
01:22:16,035 --> 01:22:19,205
It's fitting that you
and the Tower should fall together.

862
01:23:10,632 --> 01:23:11,674
Roland.

863
01:23:14,636 --> 01:23:16,596
Roland, get up.

864
01:23:22,101 --> 01:23:24,437
I do not aim with my hand.

865
01:23:24,604 --> 01:23:28,191
He who aims with his hand
has forgotten the face of his father.

866
01:23:28,983 --> 01:23:30,485
I aim with my eye.

867
01:23:35,907 --> 01:23:37,951
I do not shoot with my hand.

868
01:23:38,117 --> 01:23:39,744
He who shoots with his hand...

869
01:23:39,911 --> 01:23:42,789
Has forgotten the face of his father.

870
01:23:43,957 --> 01:23:45,166
I shoot with my mind.

871
01:23:45,333 --> 01:23:47,252
I shoot with my mind.

872
01:23:48,586 --> 01:23:50,922
I do not kill with my gun.

873
01:23:52,715 --> 01:23:54,842
He who kills with his gun...

874
01:23:55,009 --> 01:23:56,636
Has forgotten the face of his father.

875
01:23:56,803 --> 01:23:59,556
Has forgotten the face of his father.

876
01:24:05,645 --> 01:24:07,063
I kill with my heart.

877
01:24:45,455 --> 01:24:56,920

878
01:25:47,038 --> 01:25:48,456
Mom, Dad.

879
01:25:48,623 --> 01:25:50,124
- There they are.
- Sweetheart.

880
01:25:50,291 --> 01:25:52,251
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.

881
01:25:59,175 --> 01:26:00,718
Multiple witnesses saw...

882
01:26:00,885 --> 01:26:01,969
...the strange phenomena in the sky.

883
01:26:02,136 --> 01:26:03,471
Looks like we've seen the worst of it...

884
01:26:03,638 --> 01:26:05,473
The weather center
has now issued a statement...

885
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:08,518
...that it may have been some kind
of very intense solar flare.

886
01:26:11,521 --> 01:26:13,523
- Here.
- What is this?

887
01:26:13,690 --> 01:26:15,942
- Thank you.
- Thanks. Hot dog.

888
01:26:16,109 --> 01:26:17,902
Savages.

889
01:26:19,821 --> 01:26:20,905
What breed?

890
01:26:21,072 --> 01:26:22,657
No, it's not a breed.

891
01:26:30,415 --> 01:26:32,041
I have to leave here, Jake.

892
01:26:33,418 --> 01:26:35,586
You understand that, don't you?

893
01:26:36,629 --> 01:26:38,089
I know.

894
01:26:45,471 --> 01:26:46,806
Why don't you come with me?

895
01:26:51,811 --> 01:26:53,312
Really?

896
01:26:54,272 --> 01:26:56,149
You have nothing here.

897
01:26:56,315 --> 01:26:59,277
Besides, I could use your help.

898
01:26:59,569 --> 01:27:01,070
Uh...

899
01:27:01,779 --> 01:27:03,656
Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

900
01:27:04,490 --> 01:27:05,867
Gunslinger.

900
01:27:06,305 --> 01:28:06,763
