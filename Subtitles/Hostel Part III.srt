00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:38,141
Here's your key.

3
00:00:58,291 --> 00:00:59,736
Hello.

4
00:01:11,057 --> 00:01:13,242
My bad. They gave me the wrong key.

5
00:01:13,362 --> 00:01:15,851
Not your bad. We stay a little long.

6
00:01:15,971 --> 00:01:17,682
We're now leaving soon.

7
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:20,435
Okay.

8
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:24,423
- What the fuck, guy?
- It's okay, Viktor.

9
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:25,926
He's here for the room.

10
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:30,296
Yeah.

11
00:01:30,554 --> 00:01:31,697
You're on vacation.

12
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:34,065
Yeah.

13
00:01:34,184 --> 00:01:37,834
I've actually never been here
before. It's a pretty cool town.

14
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:40,378
Where are you guys from?

15
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:44,304
- Ukraine.
- Cool.

16
00:01:44,424 --> 00:01:47,760
Now that he kidnapped me I don't
know where we're gonna end up.

17
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,217
You're so dirty.

18
00:01:57,016 --> 00:02:00,156
Enough. You're gonna wear me out.

19
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,208
Come.

20
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:05,246
Have a drink with us.

21
00:02:11,876 --> 00:02:13,829
It's vodka, man. Don't be shy.

22
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:17,476
Come on, man.

23
00:02:18,029 --> 00:02:19,713
Yeah. You know, it's--

24
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,847
Well, actually I've got some beer.
Do you guys drink beer?

25
00:02:23,967 --> 00:02:25,248
It's still cold.

26
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,018
Beer?

27
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:32,360
Yeah.

28
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,734
I like this guy.

29
00:02:38,854 --> 00:02:40,565
He brings party with him?

30
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:43,187
Come.

31
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,336
There you go.

32
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:57,949
- There we go. We do a cheers now? Nazdrovia.
- Sure.

33
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,017
- Nazdrovia.
- Nazdrovia.

34
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,727
Okay. I go take shower, then we go.

35
00:03:17,734 --> 00:03:18,907
Oh, shit.

36
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,609
Fuck. I'm sorry, man.

37
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,150
No. For what?

38
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,907
Never mind. It's human nature.

39
00:03:26,027 --> 00:03:28,109
- I'm looking everything that moves.
- Right.

40
00:03:28,364 --> 00:03:30,281
- Okay.
- She's hot, right?

41
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,315
- Yes, she's pretty hot.
- Yeah.

42
00:03:33,316 --> 00:03:34,981
Yeah.

43
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:39,988
Hey, we were in this club, crazy
chicks. You go there, you're gonna score.

44
00:03:40,108 --> 00:03:41,410
I have club card for you.

45
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,874
- No, no, no.  - You're gonna
go in there, man. Connection.

46
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,162
Anka, I need that club's card.

47
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:50,704
- Hold on. I lose it.
- Okay.

48
00:03:50,824 --> 00:03:52,687
Baby, I need the club card.

49
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,232
Anka!

50
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,745
Shit. Something's fucking wrong?

51
00:03:58,865 --> 00:04:01,009
What the fuck? Anka!

52
00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:03,983
Hey, get in here! We got a problem, man.

53
00:04:04,103 --> 00:04:05,382
Anka.

54
00:04:05,502 --> 00:04:07,148
Talk. Talk.

55
00:04:07,268 --> 00:04:09,589
Hey, get in here, man. Come on!

56
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,863
I think she's having a heart
attack or something. Talk to me!

57
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,795
What the fuck you
doing, man? Get in here!

58
00:04:16,915 --> 00:04:18,400
Anka, talk to me.

59
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,612
Come on, man. We gotta
get her to a doctor.

60
00:04:21,732 --> 00:04:23,999
Help me, man. Call a fucking doctor!

61
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:26,707
Hey! Come on, man!
What the fuck? Help me!

62
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,305
Call the fucking doctor! What
the fuck you standing there?

63
00:04:30,425 --> 00:04:33,508
What the fuck you
doing, man? Get in here!

64
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,488
What--?

65
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,290
What is going on?

66
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:55,823
Anka.

67
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,096
Yeah, we're good to go.

68
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:39,072
Here.

69
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,511
Keep her dry. If she gets sick,
we'll have to discount her.

70
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:08,364
Come on.

71
00:07:08,484 --> 00:07:10,701
Save that shit for
the honeymoon, please.

72
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:12,932
The best man.

73
00:07:13,052 --> 00:07:17,103
You know, since I am the
best man, which clearly I am,

74
00:07:17,223 --> 00:07:20,009
you know, why is it
that she's marrying you?

75
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:22,115
You had your chance freshman year.

76
00:07:22,235 --> 00:07:24,151
- What ever happened?
- I don't know.

77
00:07:24,271 --> 00:07:25,845
You were a man-whore?

78
00:07:25,965 --> 00:07:29,118
Not in front of her. Thanks for that.

79
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:31,755
Come on, let's go.

80
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:37,933
Again. More of this.

81
00:07:38,053 --> 00:07:41,036
You get to kiss this jackhole
for the rest of our life.

82
00:07:41,156 --> 00:07:43,071
This weekend, he's mine.

83
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:46,122
- Such a dick.
- Don't let him bang any strippers.

84
00:07:46,242 --> 00:07:47,434
What?

85
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:50,321
There are no strippers in Palm Springs.

86
00:07:50,441 --> 00:07:53,879
Well, there's no decent strippers
in Palm Springs, all right.

87
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:55,950
Once I get him out on the course,

88
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,248
the only thing he's gonna be
banging is five irons, Ames.

89
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:00,742
Okay.

90
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:04,586
- I'll call you from the hotel.
- Be safe.

91
00:08:04,706 --> 00:08:06,320
All right.

92
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:19,206
- A little breakfast?
- No. I'm good. It's a little early.

93
00:08:19,326 --> 00:08:21,606
- Even for you.
- This is nothing, man.

94
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,542
In a couple of hours, you
are gonna be doing blow

95
00:08:25,662 --> 00:08:27,343
off some hot stripper's ass.

96
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,665
You said there were no good
strippers in Palm Springs.

97
00:08:31,785 --> 00:08:33,287
There aren't.

98
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:37,188
We're not going to Palm Springs, are we?

99
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,286
Holy shit.

100
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:33,709
Holy shit.

101
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:36,149
What the fuck is this?

102
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:44,749
Anka.

103
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:46,778
Anka.

104
00:09:47,047 --> 00:09:48,224
Anka.

105
00:09:48,599 --> 00:09:49,603
Get up!

106
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:50,873
Anka!

107
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:54,160
Hey! Who the fuck are you guys?

108
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,948
What the fuck you doing?

109
00:09:56,068 --> 00:09:58,070
What the fuck you want with us?

110
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,435
Anka!

111
00:09:59,746 --> 00:10:00,647
Hey!

112
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,707
Come to me!

113
00:10:03,827 --> 00:10:05,939
You motherfuckers, don't touch her!

114
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:08,243
Don't touch her!

115
00:10:08,363 --> 00:10:09,441
Come to me!

116
00:10:09,561 --> 00:10:10,985
Come to me, motherfuckers!

117
00:10:11,105 --> 00:10:12,588
Who are you? Where--?

118
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:15,931
Where the fuck are you taking her?

119
00:10:16,051 --> 00:10:18,006
I don't wanna die!

120
00:10:18,126 --> 00:10:19,753
Anka! I'm gonna come for you!

121
00:10:19,873 --> 00:10:22,287
Let go! Let go!

122
00:10:22,407 --> 00:10:23,489
No!

123
00:10:23,609 --> 00:10:24,725
Anka!

124
00:10:24,845 --> 00:10:26,630
Anka, I'm gonna come for you!

125
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,668
All you motherfuckers are gonna die!

126
00:10:28,788 --> 00:10:29,419
No!

127
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,661
What's up? How's the leg?

128
00:11:25,781 --> 00:11:27,035
It's okay. Carter.

129
00:11:27,155 --> 00:11:29,664
How are you, Mike? I'm glad you made it.

130
00:11:29,784 --> 00:11:30,856
Good to be here.

131
00:11:30,976 --> 00:11:34,526
- How you doing? Wouldn't miss it.
- Thanks for coming.

132
00:11:34,646 --> 00:11:36,969
We're not here for you.
We're here for this.

133
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:39,438
Bounce it. Up and down, north to south.

134
00:11:39,558 --> 00:11:42,043
How great is this? Tits
and ass at your table.

135
00:11:42,163 --> 00:11:44,425
I could get all the
stripper action I want,

136
00:11:44,545 --> 00:11:47,912
look my wife in the face and say
I never went to the club. Genius.

137
00:11:48,032 --> 00:11:50,144
- Sit down. Let's do some damage.
- Okay. Cool.

138
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,158
Look at that.
Spade and neutered. What's up?

139
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:04,595
Yeah. Dude, some come for the
free booze, I come not to lose.

140
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,261
Pay me, motherfucker.

141
00:12:10,414 --> 00:12:12,735
Winner, winner,
chicken dinner, bitches.

142
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,184
This whole place is a lab experiment.

143
00:12:21,304 --> 00:12:23,683
Look. Look at it. There are no windows.

144
00:12:23,803 --> 00:12:26,516
There are no clocks on the walls.

145
00:12:26,636 --> 00:12:29,022
They pump oxygen in
here to keep you awake.

146
00:12:29,142 --> 00:12:32,252
They give you free
booze to keep you drunk.

147
00:12:32,372 --> 00:12:35,057
They parade women in front
of you on top of that.

148
00:12:35,177 --> 00:12:38,908
It's all just to take your money.
Man, this place is evil incarnate.

149
00:12:39,028 --> 00:12:41,799
Yeah, maybe so, but
not when you're winning.

150
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:45,160
Mikey, you're looking a
little light over there.

151
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,757
Me? I'm golden. It's
you I'm worried about.

152
00:12:47,877 --> 00:12:49,774
Oh, God. Don't start this shit.

153
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:51,923
Wait, what shit?

154
00:12:52,043 --> 00:12:55,065
His "don't do it" speech.
I've heard every version of it.

155
00:12:55,185 --> 00:12:58,685
You're gonna tell him not to get
married. You don't want him to get married, but-

156
00:12:58,805 --> 00:13:01,619
- You're married, you know that, right?
- Yeah. I know.

157
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:04,260
And it's a living
hell, Carter. Seriously.

158
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,895
Marriage is nothing
but a three-ring circus.

159
00:13:07,015 --> 00:13:11,159
Engagement ring, wedding
ring, suffering. You'll see.

160
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:14,167
Yeah, but it's gonna
be different for Scotty.

161
00:13:14,287 --> 00:13:17,068
Really? Interesting. How exactly?

162
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,562
Because he's not marrying a bitch.

163
00:13:19,682 --> 00:13:22,712
See, there it is.
He comes in with a--

164
00:13:22,832 --> 00:13:25,905
I am getting married in one
week, and you and your lovely wife

165
00:13:26,025 --> 00:13:29,142
- are gonna be there.
- My lovely fat wife. Yes, we will.

166
00:13:29,262 --> 00:13:32,726
- Okay, time to go.
- What are you doing? I'm hot.

167
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:36,233
That's why they sent over the
cooler. Asians are bad luck.

168
00:13:36,353 --> 00:13:38,657
You make good firecrackers, though.

169
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:40,455
That is just some racist bullshit.

170
00:13:40,575 --> 00:13:42,564
I'm sorry, man. He did not mean that.

171
00:13:42,684 --> 00:13:44,165
All right. So, what now?

172
00:13:44,285 --> 00:13:45,801
Got Cirque du Soleil tickets.

173
00:13:45,921 --> 00:13:48,494
So you're not only
disabled, you're also gay.

174
00:13:48,614 --> 00:13:49,832
Sometimes.

175
00:13:49,952 --> 00:13:51,803
But it's not gonna matter too much

176
00:13:51,923 --> 00:13:55,536
because Scotty is getting
seriously eye fucked

177
00:13:55,656 --> 00:13:58,374
by the girls at the
progressive slots. See them?

178
00:13:58,494 --> 00:14:01,745
Dude, they are hot. And I bet
you they hate their fathers.

179
00:14:01,865 --> 00:14:04,682
- Yes.
- What are you doing? Don't start.

180
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,949
I'm not doing anything.
Justin, do your thing. Limp on over.

181
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:10,023
Nothing wets a pussy
like this hardware?

182
00:14:10,143 --> 00:14:11,744
Pity fuck is still a fuck.

183
00:14:11,864 --> 00:14:13,521
That's true.

184
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,229
Hey, guys.

185
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,727
- I'm Kendra.
- I'm Nikki.

186
00:14:20,847 --> 00:14:25,137
Hi. I'm Scott. This is
Carter, Mike and Justin.

187
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:28,321
So you girls wanna join the party?

188
00:14:28,441 --> 00:14:29,773
Not much of a party.

189
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:33,883
- We're just kind of getting started.
- We have a Jacuzzi.

190
00:14:34,003 --> 00:14:36,917
It's in our room, if you
guys wanted to head up there.

191
00:14:37,037 --> 00:14:38,315
Smooth.

192
00:14:38,435 --> 00:14:40,388
You guys have any better ideas?

193
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:46,055
We know a place, but it's off the Strip.

194
00:14:46,175 --> 00:14:48,824
Yeah, it's way off the Strip.

195
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:56,737
I don't know, it might be too much
for some nice boys from the suburbs.

196
00:14:56,857 --> 00:14:58,466
It's a little freaky.

197
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,466
Do you like freaky?

198
00:15:00,586 --> 00:15:04,206
We like freaky. We've always
been into that sort of thing.

199
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:07,644
What about you?

200
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:10,915
Do you like freaky?

201
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,452
Yeah.

202
00:15:12,572 --> 00:15:13,646
Yeah, sure.

203
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:35,110
Hey, listen, on the radio here,

204
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:37,473
I love this guy. I have his records.

205
00:15:37,593 --> 00:15:41,034
But do you think you could
turn it down a couple of notches

206
00:15:41,154 --> 00:15:42,879
so we can hear ourselves?

207
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,514
Thank you.

208
00:15:49,634 --> 00:15:52,025
Yeah. Do you think that
those girls are pros?

209
00:15:52,145 --> 00:15:54,060
- What, hookers?
- No, tennis pros.

210
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,722
Who cares? I wanna poke them in
their vaginas with Justin's crutch.

211
00:15:57,842 --> 00:16:00,597
Go check their oil with my
tongue. Know what I mean?

212
00:16:00,717 --> 00:16:03,069
A little low down there?
You need a fill-up?

213
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:06,342
Hey, you know your
meter's not working, man.

214
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,878
You high rollers pay me
20 bucks, I call it even.

215
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,717
- You sure this is right?
- I think that's it back there.

216
00:16:16,837 --> 00:16:19,531
The GPS shows it should be right here.

217
00:16:19,651 --> 00:16:21,603
You see a club? I don't see a club.

218
00:16:21,723 --> 00:16:23,757
All I see is a bacon factory.

219
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:29,111
What are you afraid of? Think
I'm gonna drive you to the alley

220
00:16:29,231 --> 00:16:32,528
where my friends steal your
money and cut your heads off?

221
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:37,515
Okay, time to go.

222
00:16:37,635 --> 00:16:39,935
- All right.
- Okay.

223
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,743
That is way off the Strip, all right.

224
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:52,397
- Are you sure this is it?
- It's the address she gave us.

225
00:16:52,517 --> 00:16:55,420
Those girls were right.
This place is pretty freaky.

226
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,455
What you want?

227
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:05,179
We're here for the party.

228
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:07,442
You on the list?

229
00:17:07,562 --> 00:17:09,763
Yeah. Nikki and Kendra sent us?

230
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:13,741
So you're that deal?

231
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,777
What does that mean?

232
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:20,361
It means you're gonna have a nice time.

233
00:17:20,481 --> 00:17:22,619
Come on in. Down the hall.

234
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:48,283
Dude, this place feels fucked.

235
00:17:48,403 --> 00:17:49,715
I think we should go.

236
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:52,861
- What, go check out Cirque du Soleil?
- Sure.

237
00:17:52,981 --> 00:17:54,579
Your vagina's hanging out.

238
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:55,521
- What?
- Yeah.

239
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:57,565
- How did that get out?
- Second time today.

240
00:17:57,685 --> 00:17:59,220
My goodness.

241
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:04,145
Well, we're here. Might as
well see what it's all about.

242
00:18:04,265 --> 00:18:06,182
"Might as well see what it's all about."

243
00:18:06,302 --> 00:18:08,195
Dude, we're not going anywhere.

244
00:18:10,182 --> 00:18:11,839
Oh, fuck. That's me.

245
00:18:12,201 --> 00:18:14,280
- Fuck, dude.
- It's Amy.

246
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,181
You probably wanna take that.

247
00:18:16,301 --> 00:18:18,879
- You're practically married.
- Guess what I do.

248
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:23,151
When I'm away from my wife, I turn off
my phone. She can't call, can't text,

249
00:18:23,271 --> 00:18:26,922
can't make me send a photo of
where I'm at because she's insecure.

250
00:18:27,042 --> 00:18:30,624
- That's why your marriage sucks.
- She put on 30 pounds, so...

251
00:18:30,965 --> 00:18:32,325
Amy, hey.

252
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:35,184
You said you would call
when you got to the hotel.

253
00:18:35,304 --> 00:18:36,489
<i>I know, I'm sorry.</i>

254
00:18:36,609 --> 00:18:41,783
Look, we're just walking in
somewhere, so I'm-- I gotta go.

255
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:44,578
<i>So I'll call you when I get
back to the hotel tonight?</i>

256
00:18:44,882 --> 00:18:47,023
- Scott.
<i>- Yeah?</i>

257
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:50,233
Should I be worried about you?

258
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:51,904
No.

259
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,898
<i>Please don't do this.</i>

260
00:18:54,139 --> 00:18:57,979
<i>You have nothing to worry
about, okay? I love you.</i>

261
00:18:58,186 --> 00:18:59,162
Okay.

262
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,772
I love you.

263
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:14,550
Guys?

264
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:18,222
Very funny.

265
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,073
Hello?

266
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:28,458
Hello?

267
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:49,779
What the fuck? What are you doing?

268
00:19:49,899 --> 00:19:51,864
Stop it! I can't fucking breathe!

269
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,836
Where the fuck are you taking me?

270
00:19:58,321 --> 00:20:00,108
Let me go!

271
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:25,890
What the fuck?

272
00:20:34,439 --> 00:20:36,409
Now, that's a bachelor party.

273
00:20:39,177 --> 00:20:40,454
You fuckers!

274
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:42,546
You assholes!

275
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,005
I'm gonna shoot you. I'm gonna kill you.

276
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,628
- Are you in on it?
- I had no idea.

277
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:06,339
Scott! Scott! Scott!

278
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,939
Scott! Scott! Scott!

279
00:21:22,987 --> 00:21:26,257
They won't put their clothes on.
They just won't do it.

280
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,022
Are you mad?

281
00:21:31,398 --> 00:21:32,565
Maybe.

282
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,196
You guys set me up pretty good.

283
00:21:36,316 --> 00:21:38,568
Hey, it's what they paid us to do.

284
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:41,207
So you're a...?

285
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,672
What do they call you now?

286
00:21:43,792 --> 00:21:46,329
This week, "escorts."

287
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,542
Are you disappointed?

288
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:52,014
No.

289
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:53,988
Good.

290
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:56,825
Let's go.

291
00:21:57,582 --> 00:21:58,532
Where?

292
00:21:58,652 --> 00:22:00,797
The champagne room.

293
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:05,227
You are gonna get me in so much trouble.

294
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,979
Hey, I'm Angela.

295
00:22:09,883 --> 00:22:10,813
Hey.

296
00:22:12,743 --> 00:22:14,007
I'm Justin.

297
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:16,616
I'm sorry.

298
00:22:16,736 --> 00:22:18,870
- Gotta get back to my friend.
- Sure thing.

299
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:22,191
Just so you know, darling,
this thing stays hard all night.

300
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,881
Who lit the fuse on her tampon?

301
00:22:25,001 --> 00:22:26,647
Tampon.

302
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:29,884
What is wrong with your friend?

303
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:32,589
A lot.

304
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:34,711
You're too sweet for her.

305
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:39,842
So why don't you stay here?

306
00:22:39,962 --> 00:22:41,891
I want you to wait for me

307
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,454
because I don't know how long
your friend's gonna be, okay?

308
00:22:46,422 --> 00:22:47,915
You ready?

309
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,060
I just came in my pants.

310
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,618
That's not my wife.

311
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,246
That's not my wife.

312
00:22:55,191 --> 00:22:57,848
Don't tell anyone. Keep a secret.

313
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,305
Yeah.

314
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:40,067
No. No, no. Can we--?
Can we just--?

315
00:23:40,187 --> 00:23:42,109
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

316
00:23:42,229 --> 00:23:43,541
Slow is cool.

317
00:23:43,661 --> 00:23:45,704
We've got the room for an hour.

318
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:47,817
No, no.

319
00:23:47,937 --> 00:23:51,386
No. I'm just thinking
maybe we could just talk.

320
00:23:51,506 --> 00:23:54,007
- Talk?
- Yeah.

321
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:55,691
Yeah. Yeah.

322
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:59,346
Like, are you from Vegas?

323
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,628
Is that what you wanna talk about?

324
00:24:02,748 --> 00:24:05,411
No, no. It's just that...

325
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:09,881
No. It's just that...

326
00:24:11,778 --> 00:24:13,571
Is this your first time?

327
00:24:13,778 --> 00:24:15,226
No. I'm--

328
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,826
I'm getting married.

329
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:18,740
Not tonight.

330
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,111
Not tonight. No, not tonight.

331
00:24:21,231 --> 00:24:23,048
Please, Kendra. Kendra. Wait.

332
00:24:23,168 --> 00:24:26,241
Just relax, okay?

333
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:29,357
Nobody's gonna know anything.

334
00:24:29,477 --> 00:24:30,652
Yeah. I know, I know.

335
00:24:30,772 --> 00:24:36,494
No, but look--
Look, I was unfaithful last year.

336
00:24:36,614 --> 00:24:39,585
All right, my fiancée found
out and I almost lost her.

337
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:43,755
All right, I realize how fucking
lame this sounds, I do, but I just...

338
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:47,652
I told myself that I wasn't
gonna be that guy anymore.

339
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:50,733
Hey, I get it.

340
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:54,342
It's cool. Nothing has to happen.

341
00:24:54,462 --> 00:24:56,902
We can just hang out.

342
00:24:57,929 --> 00:24:59,875
At least, here.

343
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:01,941
Have another drink.

344
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:08,560
I just found out who
killed JFK. You wanna know?

345
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:12,395
You still have your clothes on.
You are slow, you little bitch.

346
00:25:12,515 --> 00:25:13,729
What's up?

347
00:25:13,849 --> 00:25:17,066
- Somebody threw up in our room so--
- Somebody?

348
00:25:17,186 --> 00:25:18,264
Yeah.

349
00:25:18,384 --> 00:25:20,842
- Yeah, you did.
- Hey, you can't keep a secret.

350
00:25:20,962 --> 00:25:25,004
Close your mouth, open your legs.
Close your mouth, open your legs.

351
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:26,945
- Are you okay?
- No.

352
00:25:27,065 --> 00:25:30,143
No. I need to get some air.

353
00:25:30,263 --> 00:25:31,463
Okay.

354
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:34,289
Air is good. Air is good. Get some H2O.

355
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:36,483
No, that's water. Hey.
What are you doing?

356
00:25:36,603 --> 00:25:38,992
- Great.
- You're hot, but I need you to leave.

357
00:25:39,112 --> 00:25:42,650
You're hotter. Hi, Nikki.

358
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:51,965
Indy 500.

359
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:54,992
One more, one more.

360
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:42,376
Open up!

361
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:59,060
Come on. Is anybody in there?

362
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:04,400
Please!

363
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:10,031
Open the fucking door.

364
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,031
Bachelor boy finally woke up?

365
00:29:04,151 --> 00:29:07,449
Yeah. I think the warm
piss in his pants did it.

366
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:09,565
We thought you were dead.

367
00:29:09,685 --> 00:29:11,919
Just dead drunk.

368
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:14,663
Ugh. God.

369
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:25,651
You know, I would have
carried you to bed,

370
00:29:25,771 --> 00:29:29,314
but you're fucking huge and
I've got a gimpy leg, so...

371
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:34,812
Last thing I remember, I was
throwing up and got locked out of the club.

372
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:39,215
How did you get back here?
You were here when we got in.

373
00:29:42,251 --> 00:29:45,485
The cabbie. The cabbie
with the broken meter.

374
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:50,671
- Did you at least get laid?
- No. But she was a cutie.

375
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:55,961
That pisses me off because I paid that whore
good money to rock your world. In advance.

376
00:29:57,862 --> 00:30:01,417
Where's Mike? Did he pass out in
the tub covered in his puke again?

377
00:30:01,537 --> 00:30:06,961
Yeah, probably. But not here. He
went home with that Nikki girl.

378
00:30:07,081 --> 00:30:08,256
He hasn't resurfaced.

379
00:30:08,376 --> 00:30:10,144
Did you try calling him?

380
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,162
Dude, his phone's in the sex dead zone.

381
00:30:13,282 --> 00:30:15,429
He's miles from home. Remember?

382
00:30:15,549 --> 00:30:18,199
It's not gonna be on until
we get back to Phoenix.

383
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:20,104
<i>- You've reached Mike.</i>
- Voice mail.

384
00:30:20,224 --> 00:30:23,337
<i>- I'm in Vegas. Leave me alone!</i>
- Hey, Mikey, it's Scott.

385
00:30:23,457 --> 00:30:26,227
Turn your phone on, man.
We're looking for you.

386
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:30,753
I wouldn't worry too much about Mike.
He knows what time our flight is.

387
00:30:30,873 --> 00:30:35,704
It's the spell of Vegas, man.
Like I said, it is pure evil.

388
00:30:35,824 --> 00:30:39,575
Looks like Mikey was getting the
bachelor party you were supposed to.

389
00:30:39,695 --> 00:30:40,606
Yeah.

390
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,645
What the fuck is this?

391
00:30:56,765 --> 00:30:59,338
What the fuck did you
guys put in that champagne?

392
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:02,127
It's got a nasty aftertaste.

393
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:06,881
I know I ate some fucking
pussy. What is this?

394
00:31:07,001 --> 00:31:11,204
All right, I get it. I got you,
Scott. Now you got me.

395
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:14,661
Come on, guys. What the fuck?

396
00:31:14,781 --> 00:31:17,163
- Shit.
- Yeah.

397
00:31:17,283 --> 00:31:19,786
- You are in the shit.
- Who the fuck are you?

398
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:24,364
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like I'm doing?

399
00:31:24,484 --> 00:31:27,601
- I'm not gonna die in here.
- Who said anything about dying?

400
00:31:27,721 --> 00:31:30,178
- Come to me, motherfucker!
- What is going on?

401
00:31:30,298 --> 00:31:31,837
Come on, you motherfucker.

402
00:31:31,957 --> 00:31:34,262
What is he doing to him?

403
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:36,711
Oh, my God! Oh, my fucking God!

404
00:31:36,831 --> 00:31:38,286
Get the fuck away from me!

405
00:31:38,406 --> 00:31:41,549
Scott! Justin! What
the fuck is going on?

406
00:31:41,669 --> 00:31:43,556
There's our snaky motherfucker!

407
00:31:43,676 --> 00:31:46,543
Oh, my fucking God.
Get the--

408
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,016
- I like when they fight.
- Yeah.

409
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:55,251
Fucking son of a fucking bitch!

410
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:58,665
Get the fuck off of me!

411
00:31:58,785 --> 00:32:00,309
Fucking piece of shit!

412
00:32:00,429 --> 00:32:02,502
Is this a fucking joke? What the fuck?

413
00:32:02,622 --> 00:32:04,528
Fuck you!

414
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:08,673
Please. I didn't do
anything. This is a mistake.

415
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:09,875
Guys, please!

416
00:32:09,995 --> 00:32:12,885
My name is Mike Malloy
from Arizona. Let me go.

417
00:32:13,005 --> 00:32:15,041
Shut your mouth. Take it like a man.

418
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,457
- Fucking asshole.
- Fucking Jes--

419
00:32:17,577 --> 00:32:20,459
Let me the fuck out of here.
Who the fuck are you?

420
00:32:20,579 --> 00:32:23,656
Who the fuck are you?
Get the fuck off of me!

421
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:25,853
No, no!

422
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:31,018
This is fucking bad.

423
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:38,824
Please. Fucking please.

424
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:45,077
What the fuck? What
the fuck are you doing?

425
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:47,723
- Is this a fucking joke?
- Oh, yeah.

426
00:32:47,843 --> 00:32:49,808
And the punch line is a killer.

427
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:53,658
My friends have money. We
have money. We can pay you.

428
00:32:53,778 --> 00:32:56,544
- We can pay you.
- You've already been paid for.

429
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:00,330
What the fuck is he talking about? What?

430
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:04,218
What do you mean "paid for"?
What the fuck is going on?

431
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:14,561
Who the fuck are these people?

432
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,076
No!

433
00:33:23,868 --> 00:33:27,509
What the fuck is going--?

434
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:42,654
Who the fuck are you people?

435
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:38,197
What are you doing?

436
00:34:38,317 --> 00:34:40,649
Oh, my God. What the fuck are you doing?

437
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:44,789
No, no. Get the fuck away
from me. Get the fuck--

438
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:47,718
No, stop.

439
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:50,263
Stop. What the fuck are you doing?

440
00:34:58,763 --> 00:34:59,798
Stop.

441
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,021
Oh, fuck.

442
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:24,298
No. What the fuck are you doing?

443
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:26,798
Please, don't let me--

444
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:32,097
Please.

445
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:38,603
Please, stop.

446
00:35:38,723 --> 00:35:40,609
Stop! Stop!

447
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:42,295
Stop.

448
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:44,514
What is wrong with you?

449
00:35:44,634 --> 00:35:46,244
This is a fucking mistake!

450
00:35:46,364 --> 00:35:49,965
Please, stop. Please don't. Please.

451
00:35:50,085 --> 00:35:52,990
What are you doing?

452
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,405
Please. Please.

453
00:35:59,525 --> 00:36:02,608
I have a wife. I have a
daughter, a son. They're 6 and 4.

454
00:36:02,728 --> 00:36:06,221
<i>Begging for family.
One minute, 58 seconds.</i>

455
00:36:06,341 --> 00:36:07,879
<i>The over-under was two minutes.</i>

456
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,492
<i>Congratulations to players
two, five and seven.</i>

457
00:36:10,612 --> 00:36:14,494
What the fuck is she talking
about? What the fuck is going on?

458
00:36:14,614 --> 00:36:16,945
I don't understand!

459
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:19,302
What the fuck is this?

460
00:36:19,422 --> 00:36:21,289
This has to be a fucking joke. No!

461
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,641
No, please, don't.

462
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:07,934
Help me, please.

463
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:39,837
<i>Hey, Mike,</i> we're still looking for you.

464
00:38:39,957 --> 00:38:42,996
We're starting to freak out
a little bit. Call us back.

465
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:46,172
Maybe we should call his wife.

466
00:38:46,292 --> 00:38:48,214
That sounds like a very good idea.

467
00:38:48,334 --> 00:38:51,353
"Have you seen Mike? We left
him at a party last night

468
00:38:51,473 --> 00:38:54,718
with a professional escort
and he disappeared." Good idea.

469
00:38:54,838 --> 00:38:56,222
What do you suggest?

470
00:38:56,342 --> 00:39:00,419
He was probably up all night dicking
that girl. Give him a couple of hours.

471
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:03,122
- We're just worried about him.
- Well, I'm not.

472
00:39:03,242 --> 00:39:05,494
I mean, look around?

473
00:39:05,614 --> 00:39:08,899
Everywhere you look,
there are coeds and milfs

474
00:39:09,019 --> 00:39:12,337
and cougars, you know?
What are we gonna do?

475
00:39:12,457 --> 00:39:15,875
- Look for him? Where?
- Where did you find those girls?

476
00:39:15,995 --> 00:39:17,671
It's Vegas. It's not hard.

477
00:39:17,791 --> 00:39:20,060
Was it some kind of service you called?

478
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:23,561
Yeah, it was
1-800-WHORES, man.

479
00:39:23,681 --> 00:39:25,071
I know how to find him.

480
00:39:25,762 --> 00:39:26,730
How?

481
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:30,782
I totally forgot. That girl,
Nikki, she gave me her card.

482
00:39:30,902 --> 00:39:33,758
- That's her e-mail address.
- We need a street address.

483
00:39:33,878 --> 00:39:37,508
Yeah. I know, it's called cyber stalking.

484
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:39,914
I'm pretty good at it.

485
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:42,927
<i>Hey, Nikki, it's Justin,</i>

486
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,802
<i>the guy with the crutch from last night.</i>

487
00:39:45,922 --> 00:39:49,638
<i>We're looking for our friend. We're
wondering if you know where he is.</i>

488
00:39:49,758 --> 00:39:52,457
<i>Please call me back. Thank you.</i>

489
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,171
She definitely lives in a trailer park.

490
00:40:25,291 --> 00:40:28,926
This is a classic Vegas
fucking fairy tale.

491
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:35,566
- What number is it?
- W17.

492
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:39,327
- And where is that?
- You know, I don't know, Carter.

493
00:40:39,447 --> 00:40:42,209
I don't have a white-trash
locator on my phone.

494
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,685
Where is it? Is it one of these?

495
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:55,891
I think it's further up.

496
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:03,703
Are we getting warmer?

497
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:08,505
- Is this the one?
- Yeah.

498
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,673
Look, I don't think anybody's here.

499
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:15,707
Hello?

500
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:18,915
Nikki? Mike?

501
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,752
No.

502
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:29,822
Your show, man.

503
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:34,394
This is definitely a bad idea.

504
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:38,630
Okay.

505
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:41,337
- Are you coming?
- No.

506
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:45,242
I'll stay out here and
keep watch, I guess.

507
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:01,384
God, it fucking reeks in here.

508
00:42:01,504 --> 00:42:02,533
Mike?

509
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:04,890
Hello?

510
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,386
Jesus.

511
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:34,486
Does it look like he's been here?

512
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:36,907
I don't know.

513
00:42:37,027 --> 00:42:39,843
I guess it would explain
all these strap-ons, though.

514
00:42:39,963 --> 00:42:41,813
He's obviously not here anymore.

515
00:42:41,933 --> 00:42:44,094
Let's get the fuck out of here.

516
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:52,476
What the hell was that?

517
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:56,574
Justin.

518
00:42:57,708 --> 00:42:59,568
Motherfuckers, get down!

519
00:42:59,688 --> 00:43:02,203
All of you, on your fucking knees now!

520
00:43:02,323 --> 00:43:03,702
It's me, Scott.

521
00:43:03,822 --> 00:43:05,932
I know who you are.
What are you doing here?

522
00:43:06,052 --> 00:43:09,077
- We need to talk to Nikki.
- So you broke into her house.

523
00:43:09,197 --> 00:43:11,804
I think this is actually a trailer.

524
00:43:11,924 --> 00:43:13,471
Shut up!

525
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,202
Okay, okay! Chill, chill!

526
00:43:17,294 --> 00:43:20,485
Don't fuck with us. Why
are you looking for Nikki?

527
00:43:20,605 --> 00:43:23,056
Our friend Mike never
came home last night.

528
00:43:23,176 --> 00:43:25,251
She was the last one we saw him with.

529
00:43:25,371 --> 00:43:28,260
And you think that he
just shacked up with her.

530
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:31,195
He's such an all-star lay,
she had to take him home.

531
00:43:31,315 --> 00:43:35,269
Kendra, look, he wouldn't call us back.
We don't know what's going on.

532
00:43:35,389 --> 00:43:38,339
This is obviously a scam
to get more money out of us.

533
00:43:38,459 --> 00:43:41,102
How much do you want?
What about you, meth mouth?

534
00:43:41,222 --> 00:43:42,539
Carter, shut up!

535
00:43:42,659 --> 00:43:46,477
Look, we're sorry that we broke
in. We just wanna talk to her,

536
00:43:46,597 --> 00:43:50,278
- see what she knows about Mike.
- You don't get it, do you?

537
00:43:50,398 --> 00:43:52,006
I can't ask her.

538
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:56,299
Nikki didn't come home last night either.

539
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,583
Tacky hooker.

540
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:04,751
Too on-the-nose.

541
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:19,826
Much better.

542
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:26,466
What do you think?

543
00:44:33,203 --> 00:44:35,706
Shut the fuck up.

544
00:44:39,743 --> 00:44:41,416
Get it done.

545
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:40,839
What the fuck are you doing?

546
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:43,080
What are you doing?

547
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:52,592
Nice and sweet, like you.

548
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:54,990
Wh--?

549
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:56,817
Help.

550
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:13,275
Help!

551
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:18,863
Come, mama.

552
00:46:18,983 --> 00:46:20,871
Help me!

553
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:29,125
What are you doing with that?

554
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:36,009
No!

555
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:39,001
Please. Help!

556
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:01,190
No. No.

557
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:09,137
What are you gonna do with that?

558
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:11,204
What are you doing?

559
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:18,569
What are you gonna do?

560
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:39,292
Stop it!

561
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:09,700
How do I know your
friend didn't hurt her?

562
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:13,491
Because I know Mike. He
wouldn't hurt anybody.

563
00:48:14,691 --> 00:48:17,001
You know what this town taught me?

564
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:19,736
Nobody knows anybody.

565
00:48:22,266 --> 00:48:26,237
What happens in Vegas
stays in Vegas, right?

566
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:28,461
There's always that one son of a bitch

567
00:48:28,581 --> 00:48:32,118
who doesn't realize that
this is all for show.

568
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:34,421
It's not real.

569
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:39,850
I've been saying that all along.

570
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:42,708
How are we gonna find them?

571
00:48:42,828 --> 00:48:47,008
We're gonna go back to the club. Start
at the beginning, retrace their steps.

572
00:48:47,128 --> 00:48:49,845
- No. I think we should call the cops.
- No.

573
00:48:49,965 --> 00:48:52,385
People disappear off
the Strip every night.

574
00:48:52,505 --> 00:48:56,320
Police don't consider it a missing
person till they've been gone a week.

575
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:59,274
Look, we're gonna find them.

576
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:01,149
There's no "we" here.

577
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:07,580
I just wanna find my friend.

578
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:17,325
You're still fucking hot.

579
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:23,237
You are dead fucking sexy.

580
00:49:25,495 --> 00:49:27,218
Oh, shit.

581
00:49:27,338 --> 00:49:29,568
Nasty little bitch.

582
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,858
Say "deep throat."

583
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:57,886
That's good. That's really good, babe.

584
00:49:58,006 --> 00:50:00,351
That's nice work. What do you think?

585
00:50:00,471 --> 00:50:03,406
Don't you think? Yeah, me too.

586
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:06,881
I'll see you.

587
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:36,918
Guys, guys. Hey.

588
00:50:37,038 --> 00:50:40,113
- I got a text from Mike.
- What is he saying?

589
00:50:40,937 --> 00:50:44,788
He says: "Sorry to disappear
on you. Crashed all day."

590
00:50:44,908 --> 00:50:46,491
- Where is he?
- Where's Nikki?

591
00:50:46,611 --> 00:50:48,000
Hold on, I'm asking.

592
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,918
Where are you?

593
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,406
"I'm with Nikki.

594
00:50:59,526 --> 00:51:02,499
She's sleeping. Battery dying."

595
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:06,302
Check it out.

596
00:51:09,032 --> 00:51:10,773
God, Nikki, what did you do?

597
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:13,718
Hey, wait.

598
00:51:13,838 --> 00:51:16,330
"Meet me here. Room 9, ASAP."

599
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:20,053
- Do you know where that is?
- Fremont district.

600
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:22,398
Okay, well, let's go kick his ass.

601
00:51:22,518 --> 00:51:24,625
I'm gonna fucking kill him.

602
00:51:58,048 --> 00:51:59,407
Are you coming, gimpy?

603
00:51:59,527 --> 00:52:02,442
I think I'm gonna save myself
for the Special Olympics.

604
00:52:02,562 --> 00:52:03,771
My leg's killing me.

605
00:52:03,891 --> 00:52:06,534
Go get that asshole and
let's get out of here.

606
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:44,700
Hey, Mikey.

607
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:46,772
Mike, are you in there or what?

608
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:49,155
Mikey?

609
00:52:49,275 --> 00:52:50,401
Nikki?

610
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:56,311
Well, at least we know they
were here. This is Nikki's purse.

611
00:52:57,874 --> 00:52:59,876
What the hell is he up to?

612
00:53:00,877 --> 00:53:02,652
Here's his phone.

613
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:04,786
And a note.

614
00:53:05,448 --> 00:53:07,808
"Guys, we stepped out.
Have a beer and chill."

615
00:53:07,928 --> 00:53:10,530
At least we know he
hasn't lost his manners.

616
00:53:13,123 --> 00:53:14,864
Hey, Mikey?

617
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:25,192
So should we just wait here for them?

618
00:53:25,312 --> 00:53:27,021
What if they don't come back?

619
00:53:27,141 --> 00:53:29,164
I'm sorry this all got so fucked up.

620
00:53:29,284 --> 00:53:32,545
As much as I'd love to
have a moment, I'm just--

621
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:34,420
Oh, fuck.

622
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:37,554
What the fuck? Go, go.

623
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:38,698
No!

624
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,176
Hey. Whoa. What the fuck?

625
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:19,041
I'm sorry, man.

626
00:54:19,161 --> 00:54:21,478
- You Justin?
- You scared the shit out of me.

627
00:54:21,598 --> 00:54:25,415
I know. I'm really sorry about
that, but Mike is looking for you.

628
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:28,818
- He's not in there?
- He's at a bar right down the street.

629
00:54:28,938 --> 00:54:31,875
Too drunk to walk. He
asked me to come get you.

630
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:33,304
Okay. He did?

631
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:34,857
Yeah. Yeah.

632
00:54:34,977 --> 00:54:37,726
- Okay, well, let me call him.
- Cool.

633
00:54:37,846 --> 00:54:40,511
- One more thing.
- What--? Oh, fuck!

634
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:54,895
Bet you thought that was
fucking hilarious, didn't you?

635
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:29,836
Look, you motherfuckers
are making a mistake!

636
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:34,936
You're making a fucking
mistake! You know that, don't you?

637
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:37,658
You have no fucking
idea what you're doing!

638
00:55:37,778 --> 00:55:40,380
Big fucking mistake!

639
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:43,727
- That's what they all say.
- Suck my dick, you faggot.

640
00:55:43,847 --> 00:55:45,714
Where the fuck are we?

641
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:47,879
Who's doing this to us?

642
00:55:48,278 --> 00:55:50,138
You're gonna meet them soon enough.

643
00:55:50,258 --> 00:55:52,654
When it's your turn,
they'll come for you.

644
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:57,739
Come here, you motherfuckers!

645
00:55:57,859 --> 00:55:59,175
Hey! Hey!

646
00:55:59,295 --> 00:56:00,406
Fucking tough guys!

647
00:56:00,526 --> 00:56:02,465
Come over here!

648
00:56:02,759 --> 00:56:03,863
Where is Anka?

649
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:09,240
I don't know what's going
on. I don't-- Hey, no! No!

650
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:12,052
- No.
- Shit! Justin, Justin! Justin!

651
00:56:12,172 --> 00:56:13,751
Why are they doing this to me?

652
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:15,453
What is going on here?

653
00:56:15,573 --> 00:56:17,082
Where are you taking him?

654
00:56:17,607 --> 00:56:18,745
That was your friend?

655
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:20,831
That was my friend. Who are you?

656
00:56:20,951 --> 00:56:23,284
You should've said goodbye to him, then.

657
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:26,634
Hey! Hey!

658
00:56:26,754 --> 00:56:28,605
Hey, you motherfucker, stop.

659
00:56:28,725 --> 00:56:29,800
Stop. Come here.

660
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,363
- Wait your turn, ése.
- Yeah, it's my fucking turn right now.

661
00:56:36,626 --> 00:56:37,541
What is that?

662
00:56:37,661 --> 00:56:39,584
Shit, why didn't you say something?

663
00:56:39,704 --> 00:56:41,450
Come on. Hurry up, let's go.

664
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:42,903
Back up. No.

665
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:49,221
Carter, what the fuck is going
on? What is that all about?

666
00:56:49,341 --> 00:56:51,008
It's Elite Hunting Club.

667
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:53,244
What the fuck does that mean?

668
00:56:53,643 --> 00:56:55,645
It means members only.

669
00:56:57,147 --> 00:56:59,564
What are you talking
about? Where are you going?

670
00:56:59,684 --> 00:57:01,766
Where the fuck are you going?

671
00:57:01,886 --> 00:57:03,826
You can't leave me in here!

672
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:06,000
Carter!

673
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:08,292
Carter!

674
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:42,729
Get Mr. McMullin his Jack and Coke.

675
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:48,233
You can hold the Coke.

676
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:53,857
Accept my apologies
for any inconvenience.

677
00:57:53,977 --> 00:57:56,429
Inconvenience? That's
what you call that?

678
00:57:56,549 --> 00:57:59,653
Those guys were gonna drag
me away like a piece of meat.

679
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:06,489
It must have been a
unique sensation for you.

680
00:58:09,385 --> 00:58:11,472
I'm glad to see you're enjoying this.

681
00:58:11,592 --> 00:58:13,529
We are professionals.

682
00:58:13,957 --> 00:58:17,268
There's a reason we kidnap
people who won't be missed.

683
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:22,946
Your special request has caused
more than a few inconveniences.

684
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:24,712
That was never my intention.

685
00:58:25,602 --> 00:58:27,548
You know that. I'm a good client.

686
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:29,455
Top-tier client.

687
00:58:29,575 --> 00:58:33,516
Which is why I entertained
the idea in the first place.

688
00:58:34,644 --> 00:58:38,131
Well, let's just agree that
mistakes were made on both sides.

689
00:58:38,251 --> 00:58:40,155
How do we move on?

690
00:58:44,053 --> 00:58:48,331
The females will make
up for the added expense.

691
00:58:53,496 --> 00:58:54,702
And the others?

692
00:58:55,265 --> 00:58:57,108
Your friends?

693
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:00,738
Collateral damage.

694
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:07,210
Do you have a problem with that?

695
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:10,535
If you do, I could call the home office.

696
00:59:10,655 --> 00:59:13,089
They don't like to hear about problems.

697
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:21,334
They were always more
his friends than mine.

698
00:59:23,993 --> 00:59:25,631
So are we good?

699
00:59:31,868 --> 00:59:33,472
Drink up.

700
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:07,551
It's okay.

701
01:03:09,752 --> 01:03:11,197
It's okay. It's okay.

702
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:14,692
It's okay.

703
01:03:31,841 --> 01:03:35,100
<i>That was a total of nine
arrows until termination.</i>

704
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:38,882
<i>Congratulations to players five and 11.</i>

705
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:47,891
Showtime.

706
01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:53,495
I have big surprise for that
cattle prod motherfucker.

707
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:00,545
What the fuck they doing to her?

708
01:04:03,806 --> 01:04:05,752
They took my woman.

709
01:04:08,811 --> 01:04:10,290
They took my Anka.

710
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:12,997
These fucking people.

711
01:04:13,117 --> 01:04:15,489
Who knows what they're doing to her?

712
01:04:18,287 --> 01:04:20,062
She was my life.

713
01:04:22,325 --> 01:04:24,430
She was my everything.

714
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:28,139
I'm getting married next week.

715
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:31,368
Well, at least you didn't
get married last week.

716
01:04:33,269 --> 01:04:34,714
And why is that?

717
01:04:35,638 --> 01:04:38,209
Because your woman would be a widow now.

718
01:04:58,160 --> 01:04:59,639
Let's go, pretty boy.

719
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:02,382
Fuck you.

720
01:05:02,502 --> 01:05:05,646
Oh, that wasn't a request.

721
01:05:07,536 --> 01:05:08,451
Okay!

722
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:09,653
Scott!

723
01:05:09,773 --> 01:05:12,351
Okay, okay!

724
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:15,017
Where the fuck are you taking him?

725
01:05:15,137 --> 01:05:16,365
Fuck.

726
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:23,124
Come on, pretty boy. It's
just a fucking jacket.

727
01:05:24,453 --> 01:05:27,059
All right, all right, all right.

728
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:29,626
That's a nice tux.

729
01:05:30,393 --> 01:05:32,930
Don't bother returning it.
Enjoy your honeymoon.

730
01:05:49,045 --> 01:05:50,802
<i>Welcome, members,</i>

731
01:05:50,922 --> 01:05:55,431
<i>to the Elite Hunting Club's
main event, a very special kill.</i>

732
01:05:55,551 --> 01:05:57,891
<i>Enjoy the show.</i>

733
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:25,853
- Don't get up. It's fine.
- What?

734
01:06:27,249 --> 01:06:28,956
What is this?

735
01:06:29,418 --> 01:06:31,295
What is this, Carter?

736
01:06:33,222 --> 01:06:36,202
This? This is actually a
really fucking cheap tuxedo.

737
01:06:36,322 --> 01:06:39,931
I have this very special custom
job I was gonna wear to the wedding.

738
01:06:40,051 --> 01:06:40,927
Okay.

739
01:06:42,631 --> 01:06:44,838
I guess now I'll wear
it to your funeral.

740
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:47,178
What are you saying?

741
01:06:48,604 --> 01:06:53,160
I didn't think they'd be able
to find it, but they did. Recognize these?

742
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:54,426
This is really great.

743
01:06:54,546 --> 01:06:56,467
Do you know what these are?

744
01:06:56,587 --> 01:06:59,505
Those are the very expensive
German kitchen knives

745
01:06:59,625 --> 01:07:02,023
that Amy registered for at Bloomie's.

746
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:03,775
I'm glad they're here

747
01:07:03,895 --> 01:07:08,541
because I actually used a
knife very much like this one

748
01:07:08,661 --> 01:07:10,775
to kill a girl at the club in Macau.

749
01:07:10,895 --> 01:07:14,633
I skinned her alive.
It took me six hours.

750
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:16,814
What kind of sick fuck are you?

751
01:07:16,934 --> 01:07:18,617
But the problem

752
01:07:18,737 --> 01:07:21,381
that I keep running into

753
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:24,962
is that the rush just
isn't there anymore.

754
01:07:25,082 --> 01:07:28,984
I needed to up the ante a bit. I
needed to kill someone who mattered.

755
01:07:30,112 --> 01:07:33,872
How are you gonna get away with it?
You can't just make me disappear!

756
01:07:33,992 --> 01:07:36,562
- That's what I pay these people for.
- What?

757
01:07:36,986 --> 01:07:39,005
What, to kill your fucking friends?

758
01:07:39,125 --> 01:07:40,408
Where are Mike and Justin?

759
01:07:40,528 --> 01:07:43,397
- What did you do with them?
- That was actually a mistake.

760
01:07:44,493 --> 01:07:46,011
That was a legitimate mistake.

761
01:07:46,131 --> 01:07:49,349
That Mike was in the wrong
place at exactly the right time.

762
01:07:49,469 --> 01:07:51,077
And Justin...

763
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:54,347
The poor bastard. He didn't deserve it.

764
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:58,609
What, I deserve this?

765
01:07:58,941 --> 01:08:01,114
Why do I deserve this?

766
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:06,854
Because you got what I want.

767
01:08:10,286 --> 01:08:11,205
Amy.

768
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:13,999
This is all about Amy?

769
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:17,403
I thought when she found
out that you cheated on her

770
01:08:17,693 --> 01:08:19,695
she would leave you right away.

771
01:08:20,062 --> 01:08:21,803
You told her.

772
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:24,775
You told her. You fucking...

773
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:29,786
She is going to be
devastated when she finds out.

774
01:08:29,906 --> 01:08:30,987
You sick fuck.

775
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:36,034
But that's okay, I will be right
there next to her to console her.

776
01:08:36,154 --> 01:08:37,762
You sick fuck.

777
01:08:37,882 --> 01:08:41,033
- You sick fuck!
-And how long do you think it'll be

778
01:08:41,153 --> 01:08:43,541
- before I'm fucking her?
- You sick fuck!

779
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:45,042
In your own goddamn bed.

780
01:08:45,162 --> 01:08:49,411
Don't you touch her! I'll fucking
kill you! I will fucking kill you.

781
01:08:49,531 --> 01:08:53,179
What kind of man are you? You
do this to your fucking friends?

782
01:08:53,299 --> 01:08:55,874
When it comes to pussy,

783
01:08:57,233 --> 01:08:58,644
I have no friends.

784
01:09:02,071 --> 01:09:03,692
You motherfuckers want a show?

785
01:09:03,812 --> 01:09:06,476
- I'll give you a fucking show.
- Go ahead.

786
01:09:07,243 --> 01:09:08,303
Yeah!

787
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:12,313
Let him go.

788
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:39,814
Yeah!

789
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:02,412
You motherfuckers want a show?

790
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:05,144
I'll give you a fucking show!

791
01:10:19,348 --> 01:10:21,555
The house always wins.

792
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:26,513
<i>The honeymoon isn't quite over
yet, Elite Hunting Club members.</i>

793
01:10:26,633 --> 01:10:29,429
<i>Now, who wants to bid
on killing the groom?</i>

794
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:52,003
Get me the fuck out of
here, you motherfuckers!

795
01:10:52,123 --> 01:10:54,107
You sick fucks!

796
01:10:54,227 --> 01:10:56,743
Come on! Come to me, you motherfucker.

797
01:10:56,863 --> 01:10:59,966
- Shut your mouth or I'll fuck you up!
- Come to me.

798
01:11:00,823 --> 01:11:02,808
My turn now! You motherfucker!

799
01:11:02,928 --> 01:11:04,469
Give me that!

800
01:11:07,730 --> 01:11:10,836
I'm so fucking happy.

801
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:16,641
You die, tough guy. It's your turn.

802
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:21,043
Die, motherfucker!
Die, you piece of shit!

803
01:11:23,646 --> 01:11:25,319
You motherfucker!

804
01:11:26,482 --> 01:11:28,484
You fucking die.

805
01:11:29,818 --> 01:11:31,798
Now I fuck your mother, okay?

806
01:11:41,497 --> 01:11:43,005
Fuck!

807
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:49,436
No!

808
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:53,183
Die, motherfucker!

809
01:11:53,303 --> 01:11:55,259
Take that, you fucking bitch!

810
01:11:55,379 --> 01:11:57,357
Come on, motherfuckers!

811
01:11:57,477 --> 01:11:59,888
<i>I repeat, we have two escaped
prisoners on the loose.</i>

812
01:12:00,008 --> 01:12:00,875
Okay.

813
01:12:03,052 --> 01:12:06,659
Sir, we have two on the loose.

814
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:10,869
- Have security round them up.
- Yes, sir.

815
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:12,931
Sound the alarm.

816
01:12:48,497 --> 01:12:50,050
Oh, my God.

817
01:12:50,170 --> 01:12:52,209
Jesus Christ.

818
01:12:54,603 --> 01:12:56,014
Oh, God.

819
01:12:57,873 --> 01:12:59,858
Oh, please. Please, please, please.

820
01:12:59,978 --> 01:13:02,713
Come on. Come on.

821
01:13:03,011 --> 01:13:04,615
Come on, come on, come on.

822
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:14,064
Fuck!

823
01:13:23,699 --> 01:13:26,976
- That mother--
- Fucking shit!

824
01:13:37,646 --> 01:13:39,182
Shit!

825
01:13:39,748 --> 01:13:40,851
Come on.

826
01:13:40,971 --> 01:13:42,586
Come on. Come on.

827
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:27,534
Oh, yes. Yes. Oh, God, please.

828
01:14:27,963 --> 01:14:30,239
Oh, God. Oh, God.

829
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:32,343
Please, please, please.

830
01:14:32,463 --> 01:14:34,378
Oh, God, please.

831
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:37,047
<i>911 operator,
what is your emergency?</i>

832
01:14:37,167 --> 01:14:39,344
Yes, I need help.
They're killing people.

833
01:14:39,464 --> 01:14:41,043
<i>What is your location, sir?</i>

834
01:14:41,163 --> 01:14:42,967
Look, I don't know where I am.

835
01:14:43,087 --> 01:14:45,162
<i>- That's okay, sir.</i>
- Oh, wait, wait.

836
01:14:45,282 --> 01:14:47,967
- Please wait.
<i>- Stay on the line. Stay calm.</i>

837
01:14:48,087 --> 01:14:50,974
- They've killed my friends.
<i>- Killed your friends.</i>

838
01:14:51,094 --> 01:14:52,857
Hurry. They're gonna kill me.

839
01:15:05,367 --> 01:15:08,126
<i>Remain calm, sir. Stay on the line.</i>

840
01:15:08,246 --> 01:15:10,285
I see dead people.

841
01:15:10,405 --> 01:15:12,414
<i>We've got a point of location.</i>

842
01:15:12,534 --> 01:15:15,054
<i>The police are on their way.</i>

843
01:15:17,312 --> 01:15:18,950
Fuck!

844
01:15:20,148 --> 01:15:24,977
My friends, please, keep your seats.

845
01:15:25,097 --> 01:15:29,605
We are experiencing a
temporary power interruption.

846
01:15:29,725 --> 01:15:31,115
As a safety precaution,

847
01:15:31,235 --> 01:15:33,737
you will be escorted to your vehicles.

848
01:15:39,334 --> 01:15:41,558
Yeah. Tennessee tuxedo called the cops.

849
01:15:41,678 --> 01:15:43,043
We've been compromised.

850
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:45,456
That's it, we're shutting down.

851
01:15:45,576 --> 01:15:46,913
Kill the prisoners?

852
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:53,000
Kill them all.

853
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:54,556
No witnesses.

854
01:16:12,901 --> 01:16:15,177
Help me, please. Please, help.

855
01:16:17,339 --> 01:16:18,647
Please, don't! Please!

856
01:16:22,711 --> 01:16:24,190
Oh, God.

857
01:16:26,148 --> 01:16:28,526
- Scott. Scott.
- Keys.

858
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:35,672
- Oh, God. Okay.
- Get me out.

859
01:16:35,792 --> 01:16:37,960
- Hurry.
- Fuck!

860
01:16:43,131 --> 01:16:44,490
Come on, come on, come on.

861
01:16:44,610 --> 01:16:45,972
Come on, come on.

862
01:16:57,323 --> 01:16:58,818
Fuck! Shit!

863
01:17:00,205 --> 01:17:01,764
One way out of here, motherfucker.

864
01:17:15,197 --> 01:17:17,387
Why the hurry?

865
01:17:17,507 --> 01:17:19,839
- The place is gonna blow.
- Yeah?

866
01:17:40,856 --> 01:17:42,267
Fuck.

867
01:17:47,295 --> 01:17:48,465
Fuck.

868
01:17:52,968 --> 01:17:54,571
Oh, Jesus.

869
01:17:54,691 --> 01:17:56,012
Fuck.

870
01:18:01,009 --> 01:18:02,955
Oh, fuck.

871
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:09,603
Okay.

872
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:21,270
Fuck you!

873
01:18:21,897 --> 01:18:22,846
Die!

874
01:19:47,149 --> 01:19:49,116
Fuck you.

875
01:20:27,455 --> 01:20:29,196
No! Wait!

876
01:20:31,593 --> 01:20:32,816
You motherfucker!

877
01:20:32,936 --> 01:20:36,098
You motherfucker,
come here! Come-- Wa--

878
01:20:39,267 --> 01:20:40,017
No!

879
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:46,112
Fuck!

880
01:21:13,602 --> 01:21:15,980
I can't believe he's gone.

881
01:21:20,242 --> 01:21:23,228
I just-- I feel like none
of this would have happened

882
01:21:23,348 --> 01:21:25,803
if I hadn't take him to Vegas.

883
01:21:25,923 --> 01:21:27,907
Don't talk like that.

884
01:21:28,027 --> 01:21:31,426
Hell, at least, you survived.

885
01:21:37,525 --> 01:21:39,004
It's okay.

886
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:41,435
You can cry.

887
01:21:48,336 --> 01:21:49,575
Carter?

888
01:21:50,338 --> 01:21:51,406
Yeah?

889
01:21:55,343 --> 01:21:57,653
I don't wanna be alone tonight.

890
01:21:59,714 --> 01:22:02,354
You don't have to be, Amy.

891
01:22:03,151 --> 01:22:04,994
I'm right here.

892
01:22:06,221 --> 01:22:08,258
I'm not going anywhere.

893
01:22:13,862 --> 01:22:15,739
I need a drink.

894
01:22:16,798 --> 01:22:18,609
- Would you like a drink?
- Yeah.

895
01:22:18,729 --> 01:22:20,713
I would love a drink. Yeah.

896
01:22:21,136 --> 01:22:22,410
Okay.

897
01:22:40,322 --> 01:22:42,773
- Can I help you with that?
- No.

898
01:22:42,893 --> 01:22:44,401
I got it.

899
01:22:51,066 --> 01:22:52,477
Problem is...

900
01:22:55,337 --> 01:22:56,509
he's alive.

901
01:22:58,139 --> 01:23:01,018
What do you say we finish
that bachelor party?

902
01:23:37,946 --> 01:23:40,256
Amy, please help me.

903
01:27:39,153 --> 01:27:41,282
The house always wins.
