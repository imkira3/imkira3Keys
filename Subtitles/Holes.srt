Get that straight.
Get that straight.

15
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,854
Let me tell you, boy,
we're burnin' up back here, man.

16
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,147
This global warmin'.

17
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:16,741
Hole in the ozone
is directly above my head.

18
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:18,700
The hole's in your head.

19
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:31,414
Barf Bag!

20
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:32,794
- Man, what you doin'?!
- Barf Bag!

21
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:34,379
It ain't that bad! Come on, man!

22
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,672
Come on, man!

23
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:38,714
This ain't funny, Dog.
Get back, Barf Bag, for real!

24
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,423
Come on!
What are you doin'?!

25
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:43,643
- Barf Bag, deal with it, baby!
- Barf Bag!

26
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,913
<i>All my life, I seemed to be
in the wrong place at the wrong time.</i>

27
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,540
<i>My grandpa, Stanley Yelnats Il,</i>

28
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:17,552
<i>says it's all because
of this 150-year-old curse.</i>

29
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,464
<i>Now, I don't really believe
in the family curse,</i>

30
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,303
<i>but when things go wrong,</i>

31
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,550
<i>it kind of helps if you can
blame it on something.</i>

32
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,221
<i>And for me, things went wrong a lot.</i>

33
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,315
Oh, jeez! Oh!

34
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,317
<i>Grandpa says our destiny is sealed.</i>

35
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:38,322
<i>Could a pair of shoes falling from the sky
really be part of my destiny?</i>

36
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,565
Come here, boy!

37
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,367
- Hold it right there!
- Hey, why you runnin'?

38
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,661
- Did you steal those shoes?
- Officer, I didn't do anything.

39
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,538
<i>- What's your name, boy?
- St... I'm Stanley. Stanley Yelnats IV.</i>

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,458
<i>You see, my father, Stanley Yelnats Ill,</i>

41
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:50,709
<i>is an inventor,</i>

42
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,375
<i>and for the last few years,
he's been trying to find a cure...</i>

43
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,664
<i>for foot odor.</i>

44
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,582
I'm glad you're here.

45
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,506
This whole floor smells like stinky feet.

46
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,216
What did you do to my Stanley?

47
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,306
Don't freak out. It's a bruise.

48
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,147
Can I just say right off the bat,
this is a big mistake.

49
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,399
Don't say nothing
until we talk to our lawyer!

50
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:16,269
You're gonna be sorry
you ever messed with Stanley Yelnats!

51
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,154
Let me see that.

52
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,689
Just don't grab it out of their hands.

53
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,653
- Why not?
- Because you're gonna make 'em angry.

54
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,325
Would you like a piece of cake?

55
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:24,861
Excuse me.

56
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,788
How about some coffee?
A little cup of coffee?

57
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,630
Now, that is a fine pair of shoes.

58
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,584
Could I just smell your shoe?

59
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,632
How about if you take your shoe off,
and I'll just...

60
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,345
Check the bedroom.

61
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:45,222
Just a minute!
Where you going?!

62
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:46,803
This warrant isn't warranted!

63
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,634
This will never hold up in court!

64
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,846
Uh-huh. Here it is.

65
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,271
We got him.

66
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,270
We share the room.
How do you know that's not mine?

67
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,819
- Which bed is yours?
- You don't have to answer that.

68
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,275
We have the right to remain silent.

69
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,441
- Oh, wouldn't that be nice.
- I sleep here.

70
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,822
It's all because of your
no-good, dirty-rotten,

71
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,450
pig-stealing great-great-grandfather.

72
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,747
There is no curse on this family.

73
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,248
There is on the men in this family.

74
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,957
<i>"If only, if only,"
the woodpecker sighs,</i>

75
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,537
Please don't sing that song.

76
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:19,002
<i>"the bark on the tree
was as soft as the skies."</i>

77
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,924
Please don't sing that song,
not at my table!

78
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,503
Ma, relax.
I don't believe in the curse, anyways.

79
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,630
We're gonna need a damn good lawyer.

80
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,514
We can't afford a lawyer, pop.

81
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:30,434
We don't need a lawyer, Stanley.
We'll just tell the truth.

82
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,641
Stanley Yelnats, please rise.

83
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,393
Stanley Yelnats IV.

84
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:40,774
Sit down!

85
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,282
I could send you to jail,

86
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,530
and I would not lose
one bit of sleep over it.

87
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,951
But I don't know what good that would do.

88
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:55,285
There is currently a vacancy
at Camp Green Lake.

89
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,496
They help troubled youth build character.

90
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,456
The choice is yours.

91
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:04,590
Camp Green Lake... or jail.

92
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,382
Uh, well,
I never have been to camp before.

93
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,888
Eighteen months, Camp Green Lake, son.

94
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:26,650
<i>Well, the sun is shinin',
but it don't feel good</i>

95
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,991
<i>Don't smile down on this neighborhood</i>

96
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:33,656
<i>When I go walkin' through
this stinkin' town</i>

97
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:38,457
<i>This is why I keep my eyes down</i>

98
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,331
<i>You keep your eyes down</i>

99
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,553
<i>The brotherhood of the misunderstood</i>

100
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:51,799
<i>Live and die here, in all likelihood</i>

101
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,886
<i>You're livin' in this town,
better pray for sundown</i>

102
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,851
<i>Like all the men, you go downtown</i>

103
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,765
<i>You keep your eyes down</i>

104
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,850
Hey, baby!

105
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,735
<i>You keep your eyes down</i>

106
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,526
<i>You keep your eyes down</i>

107
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,159
<i>You keep your eyes down</i>

108
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,453
Thanks for the ride.

109
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,239
<i>You keep your eyes down</i>

110
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:20,123
Yo, fresh meat!

111
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,253
So, uh, where's the lake?

112
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,294
Hey, what did I just tell you?
Don't be a wise guy.

113
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,632
Follow me.

114
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:41,974
Sit down.

115
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,195
What's with the sunflower seeds, man?

116
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,114
I give up smokin'.

117
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,242
Stanley Yelnats...

118
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,463
- ...The fourth?
- Yeah.

119
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,174
Everyone in my family
names their son Stanley 'cause it's...

120
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,218
Yelnats backwards.

121
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,967
It's like this... it's a little...

122
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,007
It's a...

123
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:15,800
It's a tradition.

124
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,938
My name is Mr. Sir.

125
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,057
Whenever you speak to me,
you will call me by my name.

126
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,477
Is that clear?

127
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,148
Yes, Mr. Sir.

128
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,783
Do you think that's funny?

129
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,242
Huh?

130
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,028
No, Mr. Sir.

131
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,822
This isn't a girl scout camp.

132
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:39,786
Understand?

133
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:43,498
Here.

134
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,424
Boy, you're a bag o' tricks.

135
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:51,468
Thanks.

136
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,800
You thirsty, Stanley?

137
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:55,965
Yes, Mr. Sir.

138
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:57,592
Well, you better get used to it.

139
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:00,352
You're gonna be thirsty
for the next 18 months.

140
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,943
Look around you, Yelnats.
What do you see?

141
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,400
Any guard towers?

142
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,149
How about an electric fence?

143
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:14,654
Hmm?

144
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,160
No, Mr. Sir.

145
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,279
You want to run away?

146
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,120
Go ahead, start running.
I won't stop you.

147
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,748
I'm warnin' you!

148
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,413
You heard the man, Spence.

149
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,343
Oh, don't worry.

150
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,384
This here's for yellow-spotted lizards.
I wouldn't waste a bullet on you.

151
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,467
I'm not gonna run away, Mr. Sir.

152
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:40,676
Good thinkin', Yelnats.

153
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,971
Doesn't nobody run away from here.
You know why?

154
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,723
We got the only water for 100 miles.

155
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,141
Our own little oasis.

156
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,981
You want to run away,
them buzzards will pick you clean

157
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,612
by the end of the third day.

158
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,701
Hi, Mr. Sir.

159
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,199
Undress.

160
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,207
You get two sets of clothes.

161
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,881
One for work, one for relaxation.

162
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,043
After three days,
your work clothes will be washed,

163
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,218
your second set
becomes your work clothes.

164
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,220
- Is that clear?
- Yes, Mr. Sir.

165
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,932
You are to dig one hole each day.

166
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,927
5-foot deep, 5-foot in diameter.

167
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,558
Your shovel is your measuring stick.

168
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,643
The longer it takes you to dig,

169
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,475
the longer you'll be out in the hot sun.

170
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,236
Sorry, Mr. Sir.

171
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,524
You need to keep alert
for lizards and...

172
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,818
rattlesnakes.

173
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:40,994
Rattlesnakes?

174
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,573
You don't bother them,
they won't bother you...

175
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:45,450
Usually.

176
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,836
Being bit by a rattler ain't
the worst thing that can happen to you.

177
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,121
You won't die, usually.

178
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,505
But you don't want to get bit
by a yellow-spotted lizard.

179
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,886
That is the worst thing
that can happen to you.

180
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,890
You will die
a slow and painful death...

181
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,260
Always.

182
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,054
Stanley Yelnats?

183
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:09,019
- Yeah?
- I just want you to know

184
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,933
that you may have done
some bad things,

185
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,694
but that does not make you a bad kid.

186
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,942
I respect you, Stanley.

187
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,486
Welcome to Camp Green Lake.

188
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,652
I'm Dr. Pendanski, your counselor.

189
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,704
Start that touchy-feely crap,
I'm outta here.

190
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:27,333
Give him some towels, tokens. Set him up.

191
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:30,627
You'll be in "D" tent.

192
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,130
"D" stands for "diligence."
that's the mess hall.

193
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,424
There's the rec room.
And there's the showers.

194
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:38,511
There's only one knob 'cause there's
only one temperature - cold.

195
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,929
And that's the Warden's cabin over there.

196
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,466
That's the number-one rule
at Camp Green Lake -

197
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,009
do not upset the Warden.

198
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,927
- Yeah, he seemed kind of...
- Who?

199
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,097
Oh, Mr. Sir?
Oh, he's not the Warden.

200
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:53,230
He's just been in a bad mood
since he quit smokin'.

201
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,019
Hey, Mom...

202
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,520
Who's the Neanderthal?

203
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:58,981
This is Stanley.

204
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:01,317
So, what's happening with Barf Bag?

205
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,653
Oh, Lewis won't be returning.

206
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,241
He's still in the hospital.

207
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:09,709
Stanley, meet Rex, Alan, and Theodore.

208
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:10,909
Hi.

209
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,453
Yo, my name is X-Ray.

210
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,455
And that's Squid, that's Armpit.

211
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,214
Him, he's Mom.

212
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,088
They all have their little nicknames,

213
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:21,595
but I prefer to use the names
their parents gave them,

214
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,757
the names society will recognize them by.

215
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,844
Theodore, why don't we
show Stanley his cot?

216
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:30,013
Go ahead, 'pit.

217
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,556
Welcome to your new home, Stanley.

218
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,188
Barf Bag slept here.

219
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,861
Keep your bed clean.

220
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,234
Hey, I'm Magnet.

221
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,573
That's Zigzag.

222
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,026
Hi.

223
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:48,865
What I told you
about leaving that thing right there, man?

224
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,785
And this... is Zero.

225
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,619
Say hello to Stanley, Zero.

226
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,921
Do you want to know
why they call him Zero?

227
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,676
'Cause there's nothing goin' on
in his stupid little head.

228
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,548
Did you tell him about the lizards?

229
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,342
Ricky, let's not scare Stanley.

230
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,097
His name's not Ricky.

231
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,724
It's Zigzag, a'ight?

232
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,807
Stanley, if you have any questions,
just ask Theodore.

233
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:12,680
Theodore will be your mentor.

234
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,478
- You got that, Theodore?
- Yeah, man. Whatever, dude.

235
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,771
I'm depending on you.

236
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,358
It should be no labor
to be nice to your neighbor.

237
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,692
Hey, Theodore, is there a place
where I can fill my canteen up with water?

238
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:29,072
- I know he smells that.
- Yo, my name is not Theodore.

239
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,166
It's Armpit.

240
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,703
There's a water spigot over there.

241
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:42,008
Man, 'pit,
what you gotta be so mean for?

242
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,885
Man, I ain't mean.
I'm his mentor.

243
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,679
Ain't that what I'm supposed to do?

244
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:48,633
Thanks, Armpit.

245
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,386
Man, whatever.

246
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,889
<i>Today's menu - chili, string beans,</i>

247
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,398
<i>refried beans,</i>

248
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:58,062
<i>garbanzo beans,</i>

249
00:12:58,569 --> 00:12:59,685
<i>green beans,</i>

250
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:00,936
<i>and banana jell-o.</i>

251
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,030
Hey, Stanley, come here, boy.

252
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,317
This is where you sit. Sit down.

253
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,534
Hey, yo, new kid. Hey, yo.

254
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,285
See, you didn't dig today.

255
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,546
So, uh, you wouldn't mind
giving up your bread

256
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,457
to somebody who did, now, would you?

257
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:23,960
No, you can have it.

258
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,799
So, what'd they get you for?

259
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,133
Stealing a pair of shoes.

260
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,345
From the store, or were
they still on someone's feet?

261
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,138
No, no, he just killed the dude first.

262
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,019
You just left out
that little detail, right?

263
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,312
They were Clyde Livingston's shoes.

264
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,855
Sweetfeet? What?

265
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,649
Man, you did not steal
no Clyde Livingston's Sweetfeet shoes.

266
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:40,893
His world series cleats.

267
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,819
Hold on, hold on. How did you get 'em?

268
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,525
He's, like, the fastest guy
in the majors, right?

269
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:46,531
The guy hit four triples in one game.

270
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:51,616
Clyde Livingston donated his shoes to
this, uh, this... this homeless shelter.

271
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,413
Did they have red X's on 'em?

272
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,040
What?

273
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:57,747
You got Zero to talk.

274
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,165
Hey, yo, what else can you do, Zero?

275
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:02,377
Yeah.

276
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,711
Yeah, they did.

277
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,719
Tell us a little something
of your background,

278
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,675
Mr. Livingston.

279
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:14,719
Besides the fact that it
was your donated shoes that were stolen.

280
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,931
What other connection
might you have with this case?

281
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,109
Well, I was an orphan.

282
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,273
I grew up in that home.

283
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,985
I don't understand what type of person
steals from homeless children.

284
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,619
You're no fan of mine.

285
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,391
It was all because of your
no-good, dirty-rotten,

286
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,721
pig-stealing
great-great-grandfather.

287
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,929
That's who sealed our destiny.

288
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:00,348
Why do you think
none of his inventions work?

289
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:01,561
Pa.

290
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,229
I learn from failure.

291
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:05,603
Doesn't matter how... how smart you are.

292
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,230
You need luck. Something we ain't got.

293
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,570
Yeah, what about your father,
the first Stanley Yelnats?

294
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,325
He wasn't so unlucky.

295
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,157
You told me he made a fortune
in the stock market.

296
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,446
Some luck.

297
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:16,784
Yeah, he lost everything.

298
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,996
He was robbed by Kissin' Kate Barlow.

299
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:22,586
Get on up outta there!

300
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,289
Gimme your loot!

301
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:29,839
Are you kidding me?

302
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,299
She kiss him?

303
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,182
Oh, no. She only kissed the men
she killed.

304
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:39,470
What you got down there, huh?

305
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:41,767
Pass it up! Come on!

306
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,614
She left him stranded in the desert.

307
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:53,150
Come on, boys! Let's ride!

308
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,948
No water, no food, for 16 days.

309
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,242
If she'd have kissed him,
she'd have killed him.

310
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:02,876
You'd have never been born.

311
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:16,306
Smiling faces! Smiling faces!

312
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,968
The early mole digs the deepest hole.

313
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,808
Shovels on the left,
tortillas on the right.

314
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,142
Let's go!

315
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,190
Okay, come and get it.

316
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:27,981
Let's go!
Come on, Magnet! Open them peepers!

317
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,565
Let's go! Let's go!

318
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,526
Head's still on the pillow!

319
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,738
This ain't no dreamland,
it's... it's reality.

320
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:40,372
Let's go, hotshots!
Step up and get your...

321
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,662
Hey, man, you picked up X-Ray's shovel.

322
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,297
It's shorter than the rest of them.

323
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,007
Smaller shovel, smaller hole.

324
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,599
<i>H-e-e-e-ey</i>

325
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:07,479
<i>Oh, sinners, let's go down</i>

326
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:08,893
<i>Let's go down</i>

327
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,356
<i>Let's go down</i>

328
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,863
<i>Oh, sinners, let's go down</i>

329
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,445
<i>Down in the valley to pray</i>

330
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:16,858
<i>Oh, sinners</i>

331
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,694
- <i>- Let's go down</i> - MR.
- This isn't a girl scout camp.

332
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,115
Nobody's gonna babysit ya.

333
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:21,364
<i>Let's go down</i>

334
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,823
- Dig here.
<i>- Oh, sinners, let's go down</i>

335
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,993
- Now, if you find anything interesting...
<i>- Down in the valley to pray</i>

336
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,334
...you are to report it to me
or Pendanski.

337
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:30,839
If the Warden like what you find,

338
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,708
you get the rest of the day off.

339
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:33,875
<i>H-e-e-e-ey</i>

340
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,677
What am I supposed to be
looking for, Mr. Sir?

341
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,550
You're not looking for anything.

342
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,884
You're building character.

343
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,392
You take a bad boy,
make him dig holes all day in the hot sun,

344
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,303
and it turns him into a good boy.

345
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:47,306
That's our philosophy
here at Camp Green Lake.

346
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,981
Start digging.

347
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,892
<i>Show me the way</i>

348
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,733
<i>Good lord, show me the way</i>

349
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,031
One down, 10 million to go.

350
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,695
<i>Show me the way</i>

351
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:05,240
<i>Good lord, show me the way</i>

352
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,919
<i>Oh, sinners, let's go down</i>

353
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,299
<i>Let's go down</i>

354
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:15,754
<i>Let's go down</i>

355
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:32,355
Excuse me, can you throw that
in another pile or something,

356
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,482
- 'cause it keeps getting in my hole.
- Shut up! Just shut up!

357
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:35,941
Watch where you're moving your dirt!

358
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,860
Watch where you're throwing
your dirt, Stanley.

359
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,662
<i>It was all because
of your no-good, dirty-rotten,</i>

360
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,782
<i>pig-stealing great-great-grandfather,</i>

361
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,575
<i>Elya Yelnats.</i>

362
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,912
<i>It started in a little village in Latvia.</i>

363
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:55,170
<i>He was shoveling in Morris Menke's barn,</i>

364
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,592
<i>When Myra, his beautiful daughter,
walked by.</i>

365
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,928
<i>And that was it.</i>

366
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,756
<i>So, what does your
great-great-grandfather do?</i>

367
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:06,973
<i>He goes to a fortune-teller,
Madame Zeroni, for advice.</i>

368
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,513
All you think about is Myra Menke.

369
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,680
I know.

370
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,020
<i>That's when our troubles began.</i>

371
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:14,776
Listen to Madame Zeroni.

372
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,653
You should go to America.

373
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:19,857
That's where my son is.

374
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,650
That's your future.

375
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,363
Not Myra Menke.

376
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:26,952
<i>Her head's as empty as a flowerpot.</i>

377
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,369
Mr. Menke...

378
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,702
I would like your permission
to marry your daughter.

379
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,667
You too?

380
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:41,678
Igor Barkov has offered
his fattest pig for her.

381
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,173
What do you got?

382
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,304
A heart full of love.

383
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,013
He's just a boy!

384
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,855
I'd rather have a fat pig.

385
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,656
Morris Menke is a schmuck.

386
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,443
Okay, here's what you do.

387
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,362
Take the little one.

388
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,115
But this solves nothing.

389
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:11,954
So, it will grow.

390
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:17,335
Every day, you carry the pig
up the mountain.

391
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:21,882
Make it drink the water from the stream
while you sing...

392
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:27,558
<i>"If only, if only,"
the woodpecker sighs...</i>

393
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:28,717
Woodpecker sighs.

394
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:32,513
...<i>"the bark on the tree
was as soft as the skies."</i>

395
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:37,776
<i>While the wolf waits below,
hungry and lonely</i>

396
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:44,067
<i>He cries to the moon, "if only, if only."</i>

397
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,696
<i>Every day, the pig will get fatter,</i>

398
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,908
<i>and you will get stronger.</i>

399
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:58,043
Now, after you give the pig to Menke,

400
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:01,083
you must carry Madame Zeroni up a mountain

401
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:05,587
and sing while I drink
so I can get strong, too.

402
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:13,474
But, if you forget to come back
for Madame Zeroni,

403
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:18,851
you and your family
will be cursed for always and eternity.

404
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,702
- Get your water, Dog. Get your water.
- Oh, my god.

405
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,158
Here comes the water truck.

406
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:36,452
- First hole's the hardest, right?
- Let's go!

407
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,537
Hey, Mr. Sir.

408
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,585
- What you doin', man?
- Get your place in line, Magnet!

409
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:42,882
Keep your hands off of me, man!

410
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:46,382
So, how'd it go your first day, Yelnats?
Got some blisters on ya?

411
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,046
- Big, fat blisters.
- Yeah.

412
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,801
Well, don't worry.

413
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:51,599
Everything turns to callus eventually.

414
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:53,101
That's life. Next.

415
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,097
Myra!

416
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,516
Who do you choose - Igor Barkov...

417
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:01,355
or Elya Yelnats?

418
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,735
You want me to decide?

419
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,193
That's right, my blossom.

420
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,704
Gee, I don't know.

421
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,342
Which pig weighs more?

422
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,462
They are the same.

423
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:33,679
Oh, I know!

424
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:38,764
I will think of a number between 1 and 10.

425
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,185
Okay, I'm ready.

426
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:45,027
Marry Igor.

427
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:48,319
You can keep my pig as wedding present.

428
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:54,908
Two pigs for one daughter!

429
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,681
You done already?

430
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:22,186
Don't you know, man?

431
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,400
He's, like,
the fastest digger in the camp.

432
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:27,608
He's a mole.
I think he eats the dirt.

433
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:29,318
He's a weird dude.

434
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,816
Moles don't eat dirt.

435
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,152
- Worms eat dirt.
- Really?

436
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,032
<i>So that was it.</i>

437
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,919
<i>He took Madame Zeroni's advice
and went to America, like her son,</i>

438
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:47,333
<i>but the dummy forgot to go back
and carry Madame Zeroni up the mountain.</i>

439
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:51,758
<i>If you forget to come back
for Madame Zeroni,</i>

440
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:56,933
<i>you and your family will be cursed
for always and eternity.</i>

441
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:11,030
Somebody help me!

442
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:12,983
Anybody up there?!

443
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:17,446
I'm done with my hole now!

444
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,332
Oh, god.

445
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,340
Oh, god.

446
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,688
Don't move.

447
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,072
Oh, f...

448
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:21,309
Get your stuff.

449
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:32,145
Get yourself a good sleep, son.

450
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,484
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.

451
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:39,861
Oh, my god!

452
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:46,868
What color was his blood?

453
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,253
I don't... I don't know. I couldn't tell.

454
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:50,959
I wish I'd have seen it.

455
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,752
Bam!

456
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,093
If Mr. Sir didn't shoot it...

457
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,754
Stanley, you'd be in a hole.

458
00:25:58,182 --> 00:26:00,720
Did you know
that each one's got exactly 11 spots?

459
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:03,681
Yeah, man, but if you ever get
close enough to count 'em...

460
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:06,012
You're dead.

461
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,688
Look, it's the lizards
we're working for, man.

462
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:09,391
We build their houses for 'em.

463
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,651
I mean, yesterday, I saw, like,
10 of them in one hole.

464
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,903
Man, we ain't diggin'
for no lizards.

465
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,397
What we diggin' for then, man?

466
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,442
Like Mr. Sir said,
we're diggin' to build some character.

467
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,882
- Come on! Wake up, buddy!
<i>- Feelin' mighty fine</i>

468
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,380
<i>Feelin' mighty fine this time</i>

469
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:41,590
<i>"Dear Mom...</i>

470
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:42,932
<i>I'm having a wonderful time at camp.</i>

471
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,054
<i>Yes, I am</i>

472
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:45,802
<i>"The food's great.</i>

473
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:47,725
<i>Not as good as yours,
of course, but I like it."</i>

474
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,017
<i>Feelin' mighty fine</i>

475
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:51,023
<i>Feelin' mighty fine this time</i>

476
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,767
<i>"We've been out on the lake all day."</i>

477
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,444
Where's a person go to
the bathroom around here?

478
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,856
- Man, pick a hole, any hole.
<i>- Feelin' mighty fine</i>

479
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:01,322
<i>"Once I pass the swimming test,
I'll get to learn how to water ski.</i>

480
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,027
<i>I've made lots of friends."</i>

481
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:05,663
Oh, you're goin' to hell for sure.

482
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,490
<i>Feelin' mighty fine</i>

483
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,416
<i>- "And the water is cool and refreshing."
- Feelin' mighty fine</i>

484
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:11,832
<i>This time</i>

485
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:14,418
<i>- "You'd like my counselor. He's a doctor."
- Yes, indeed</i>

486
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,378
Smells like puke from a mule

487
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:19,090
been ruminating on asparagus
for two weeks.

488
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:21,046
<i>"And I'm really enjoying the wildlife."</i>

489
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:24,091
<i>Don't believe a word they say about me</i>

490
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,302
<i>Because I'm feelin' mighty fine</i>

491
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,228
<i>Feelin' mighty fine</i>

492
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,601
- Rent time! Pay up!
<i>- This time</i>

493
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,141
<i>"The other boys aren't bad kids.</i>

494
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,401
<i>Like me, they were just in the wrong place
at the wrong time."</i>

495
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:36,610
Get on there, fool!

496
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,772
<i>"Well, that's it for now, ma.</i>

497
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:40,656
<i>Say hi to dad and grandpa for me.</i>

498
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:42,988
<i>Love, your son, Stanley."</i>

499
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:44,990
Who you writin' to?

500
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:47,409
Aw, you miss your mommy and daddy?

501
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:49,324
- I don't want them to worry.
- They don't care.

502
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,242
- Give me the letter.
- Believe me.

503
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,335
They're glad to be rid of you.

504
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:18,069
Found something.

505
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:21,489
- It's a fossil. You see that?
- Well, that's interesting.

506
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,282
Do I get a day off?

507
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:25,906
- What?
- That's what Mr. Sir said.

508
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:29,538
He said that, uh, if I found
something interesting, I get the day off.

509
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:33,285
Stanley, the Warden
isn't interested in fossils.

510
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,791
Let me see that.

511
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:39,131
- What is it?
- Man, see, look.

512
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:41,130
Look at the little fishies!

513
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:42,384
Aww!

514
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:45,301
I mean, you know,
it look like those cave pictures, man.

515
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:47,256
Ain't nothin', anyway.

516
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:50,142
Fossil. I tell you what,
I think Stanley belongs in a cave, man.

517
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:53,521
I told you he was a Neanderthal
the first time I saw him.

518
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:55,394
Guess there really was
a lake out here once, right?

519
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:57,434
There was a town, too.

520
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,946
The Warden's grandfather owned the lake

521
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:04,402
and half the town.

522
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,497
Whoo!

523
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:17,708
- Tie her off, there, boys.
- All right, now.

524
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:23,259
Get your sweet,
sweet magical ointments!

525
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:26,341
Get your elixirs, health potions,
onion tonics.

526
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,927
Onions, get your onions here, folks.

527
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,013
God's own chosen vegetable.

528
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,553
Nature's magic vegetables
right here, folks.

529
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:36,105
Mr. Collingwood,
let me see that head of yours.

530
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:37,891
- My head?
- Yes, sir.

531
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:40,109
Yeah, that's what I thought.

532
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:41,861
I got exactly what you need.

533
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,864
Just rub this on his head
every night, Mrs. Collingwood,

534
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,820
and before you know it,
his hair's gonna be

535
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:48,906
as long and as thick as Mary Lou's mane.

536
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:51,496
Sam, thank you.

537
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:58,415
The ancient Egyptians knew
the secrets of the onions.

538
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:02,081
How its potent juices
can cure stomachaches and toothaches

539
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:04,918
measles and mumps,
rheumatism, hemorrhoids.

540
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,755
If you don't believe me,
just ask Mary Lou.

541
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:11,891
All she eats is onions,
and she's almost 100 years old.

542
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:14,761
- How would you know, Sam?
- You're not a day over 25.

543
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:17,230
Nature's magic vegetable, Miss Katherine.

544
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,435
I don't care how much gold
there is back there,

545
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:24,278
I ain't goin' back
without some lizard juice.

546
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:25,942
I see your friend back there
wasn't so smart.

547
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:27,194
Too bad he didn't know

548
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,693
yellow-spotted lizards
don't like my onion juice.

549
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,988
Get your sweet, sweet onions, folks.

550
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:34,952
Health potions, lizard oils,

551
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:36,957
onion tonics, cure-alls.

552
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,627
And for you, Miss Katherine,

553
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:43,043
I have this special bag of onions.

554
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:44,423
Thank you.

555
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,250
- And your peaches.
- Thank you.

556
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:50,263
Sometimes I think Green Lake, Texas,
is heaven on earth.

557
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:52,765
Those peaches are the work of an angel.

558
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:56,265
I like peaches.

559
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,559
Come on, boys.

560
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,437
- Buy you a drink, Sheriff?
- Buy me two.

561
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,199
That was some lame crap you pulled.

562
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:15,203
What?

563
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,827
Look, man, you ever find anything,

564
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,118
give it to me, you understand?

565
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:24,380
I've been here for over six months
and never found anything.

566
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:25,624
No one has.

567
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:27,713
Why should you get a day off
when you just got here?

568
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:29,510
You know what I'm saying.
It's only fair.

569
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:31,216
Right?

570
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:33,548
- Right?
- Right.

571
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,263
That's what I call
an informed decision, Dog.

572
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:48,730
- What are you doing? No.
- I'm watching that.

573
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,318
Not today you ain't.

574
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:51,616
Look, you broke it!

575
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,197
Right there!

576
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:56,908
Watch it!

577
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,030
You watch it, man.

578
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,991
What you say to me?!

579
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,746
Sorry, man. I didn't mean...
I didn't mean to hit you.

580
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,421
You're a dead man!

581
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,086
Hey, hey.

582
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,009
Hey, just chill, okay, man, all right?

583
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:15,340
Look, we start a fight now,

584
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:17,842
the Warden will come down
hard on all of us.

585
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:19,844
Just keep that punk away from me!

586
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,474
- Cool.
- Just chill.

587
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,017
It's all right. It's all good.

588
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,474
Just relax.

589
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,143
Here's your tunes, man.

590
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,441
Don't look at him. He's crazy.
You understand me?

591
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:36,115
Hey, nobody messes
with the Caveman. Nobody.

592
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:39,247
- Did you see the Caveman back there?
- No, I don't want to mess with anybody.

593
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:42,917
Let's go eat.
Hey, you coming, Caveman?

594
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:44,369
Come on, Caveman.

595
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:45,540
Come on, Caveman.

596
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:46,836
What?

597
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:49,958
Caveman?

598
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:52,468
So, I'm Caveman?

599
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:54,048
It's better than Barf Bag.

600
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:00,764
Line up, fishies.

601
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:02,894
Get your lake water.

602
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:04,684
You get it?

603
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:06,978
Lake water. It's a joke.

604
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:13,818
You're here now, Caveman, all right?

605
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,699
- Let's go, fellas.
- Move up, fool.

606
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:17,861
Hey, X, when you moving me up?

607
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:19,154
Oh, man.

608
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,406
Can I start now, your highness?

609
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,496
Yes, Mr. Sir.

610
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:29,042
What about you, Jose?
What do you like?

611
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:30,423
I like animals.

612
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:32,584
That's what got Magnet
sent here in the first place.

613
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:36,842
Man, it's criminal the way
they keep them locked up in cages.

614
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,302
No, Jose.
What you did was criminal.

615
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:40,599
No, no. Tell 'em, Magnet.

616
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:43,056
They wanted 1,000 bucks
for just one puppy.

617
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,603
- What?
- Yeah.

618
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:47,686
I would've made it out
if my pocket didn't start barking.

619
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,404
You boys get one life,

620
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:58,197
and so far, you've done a pretty good job
of screwing it up.

621
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:03,368
So, you're Caveman now, big shot.

622
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,707
Got a nickname.

623
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,539
Well, let me tell you something, Caveman,

624
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,838
You are here on account of one person.

625
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:13,208
You know who that person is?

626
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:14,466
Yeah.

627
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,088
My no-good, dirty-rotten,
pig-stealing great-great-grandfather.

628
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:20,256
That's who it is.

629
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,179
No.

630
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:26,562
You screwed your life up, Stanley Yelnats,

631
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,351
and it's up to you to fix it.

632
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,266
It's not gonna be easy,

633
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:32,730
but you'd be surprised
what you can accomplish

634
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,520
once you set your mind to it.

635
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:37,732
Even Zero here isn't completely worthless.

636
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,109
What about you, Zero?

637
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,821
What do you like to do?

638
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,412
You just won't talk with me, will you?

639
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,831
Man, he only talks to Caveman, you know?

640
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,709
You think you're better than all this?

641
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,056
I like diggin' holes.

642
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:06,936
Then you're in the right place
for it, buddy boy.

643
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:09,973
<i>"My dearest Stanley,</i>

644
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,475
<i>your letters make me feel
like one of the other moms</i>

645
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,769
<i>who can afford to send
their kids to summer camp."</i>

646
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,278
Do not touch my shoes!

647
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:18,610
<i>"Your father thinks he's real close
to a breakthrough.</i>

648
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,241

'cause the landlord</i>

649
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:23,619
<i>is threatenin' to evict us
because of the odor."</i>

650
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,370
Sir, you are an insult
to the chemistry of smell!

651
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:27,039
- Eight months!
- You know what I'm gonna do with this?

652
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:28,453
I am going to boil it with cross-trainers!

653
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:29,621
Don't do that!

654
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:31,498
Aah! Aah!
Oh, yeah, "Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!"

655
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:36,670

657
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,886
She's crazy.

658
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:50,270
What are you laughing at?

659
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,976
Uh, just something my mom wrote.

660
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,150
She, uh
She said...

661
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:59,989
"I feel sorry for the little old lady
who lived in the shoe

662

'cause it must have smelled really bad."

663
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:06,161
You know, like the nursery rhyme.

664
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,205
I... I feel really awkward

665
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:18,796
with you reading over
my shoulder like that, so...

666
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:21,503
I can't read.

667
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:28,926
Can you teach me?

668
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,022
Um...

669
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:38,068
You know, I'm... I'm not really a...

670
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:39,607
a good teacher,

671
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:43,946
and, uh, I get tired from digging all day,

672
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:47,111
so, I just wanna come back
and chill, you know?

673
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:51,825
Just relax.

674
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:55,044
See you in there?

675
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,342
Look at this guy.

676
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:11,386
Whoo!

677
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,888
Armpit, put it down! Put it down!

678
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:17,191
Armpit!

679
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,537
Hey, look, a cloud.

680
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,240
Right there.

681
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,167
Maybe it'll move in front of the sun.

682
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:38,587
Come on, little cloud.

683
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:40,043
You can do it.

684
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:44,169
Please, that's all I'm asking
for is just a little shade.

685
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,262
Warden owns the shade, man.

686
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:49,507
Maybe we'll get lucky.

687
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,425
Maybe we'll get some clouds.

688
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:54,762
It will rain for 40 days and 40 nights.

689
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:58,353
Yeah, and we'll have to build an ark
and get two of each animal.

690
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,397
Yeah, two scorpions, two rattlesnakes,

691
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,436
two yellow spider lizards. All of that.

692
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:06,945
Hey.

693
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:09,235
What do you got there, Caveman?

694
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:11,157
What?

695
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:12,864
What do you got there?

696
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:14,949
I don't know.

697
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,123
Hey, X...

698
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:21,710
I think I might have found something.

699
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,091
Let me see that.

700
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:30,635
What do you think?

701
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:35,765
Looks like an old shotgun
shell or something, man.

702
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:38,560
No, man, it's too skinny
to be a shotgun shell.

703
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,267
- No. No, it's not a shotgun shell.
- Yeah. No, it's not a shotgun shell.

704
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:43,978
Look at this. You see that little heart?

705
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:46,064
You see that?
With the letters in it right there?

706
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:48,782
- Yeah. "K.B." that's what it is.
- Let me see.

707
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:50,488
- Let me see it.
- K.B.?

708
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:53,362
- Yeah. Yeah.
- That's Keith Berenger.

709
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:54,989
Man, who is that?

710
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:57,248
He was in my math class.

711
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,792
- Stupid.
- Good thinking, Zigzag.

712
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:00,328
Yeah, it must belong to him, huh?

713
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:01,996
Yeah, it must belong to him.

714
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,673
Well, I'm gonna go show it to Mom.

715
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:07,130
- Maybe I'll get the rest of the day off.
- Rest of the day off?

716
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:08,969
No. No. Your hole's already dug.

717
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,346
I'm not even close.
I'm gonna be out here all day.

718
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:12,840
Yeah? So?

719
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:19,059
So, uh... Why don't you, uh,

720
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:23,317
Why don't you just turn it in tomorrow?
You know, give it to Mom in the morning?

721
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,026
Then you get the whole day off.

722
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,487
That's good thinking, Caveman.

723
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:29,740
I like it.

724
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,111
Pretty smart, Caveman.
Pretty smart.

725
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,452
<i>No matter how you're sad and blue</i>

726

has it worse than you</i>

727

<i>Sometimes you gotta pay your dues</i>

728
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:44,797
<i>So, don't worry, just push on through</i>

729
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:45,956
<i>Keep'n it real</i>

730
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:48,547

who be working on the future</i>

732
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,888
<i>- Keep'n it real

<i>And doing right to keep themselves...</i>

734
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:56,217
- There you are, X.
<i>- Keep'n it real</i>

<i>Although sometimes I know
it seems impossible</i>

736
00:39:57,854 --> 00:39:58,844
Good morning, Theodore.

737
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:00,012
Man, it's Armpit.

738
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:02,727
Yo, I don't know no fool named
Theodore, all right?

739
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:05,268
- Well, I don't know no fool named Armpit.
- Whatever.

740
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:07,228
There's your water, whoever you are.

741
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,612
Hey, Mom!

742
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:09,905
I think I found something.

743
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:12,407
Come here for a second.
I think I found something.

744
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:18,531
Looks like a... Gold...
golden bullet or something, Doesn't it?

745
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,749
It's nice, right?

746
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:22,243
So, I get the day off now, right?

747
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:23,999
You just might.
We're gonna call the Warden.

748
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,211
Hey, Lou.

749
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:27,214
You better get down here.

750
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:28,798
I think we got something.

751
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:29,875
We got something nice.

752
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:31,419
Got something nice.

753
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:32,928
We got something nice.

This where you found it?

778
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:30,561
Yes, ma'am.

779
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:35,115
Dr. Pendanski, drive X-Ray back to camp.

780
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:38,820
Give him double shower tokens
and a snack.

781
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:42,414
But first, fill everyone's canteen.

782
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:43,790
I already filled them.

783
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:46,369
Excuse me?

784
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:48,708
I had already filled them
when you drove up in the car.

785
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,830
Excuse me?

786
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,507
Did I ask you when you last filled them?

787
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,840
- No. You didn't, but...
- Excuse me.

788
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,674
Now, these fine boys
have been working hard.

789
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:03,561
Don't you think it just might be possible
they have taken a drink

790
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:05,896
since you filled their canteens?

791
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:07,723
It's possible.

792
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,687
Oh, it's possible, is it?

793
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:12,019
Caveman!

794
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,695
You come over here, please.

795
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,401
- Get over there.
- That's right.

796
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,195
Go on. Come on over.
Come on over.

797
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:21,119
Now, did you
by any chance take a drink

798
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,280
since he filled your canteen?

799
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,082
Oh, no. I... I'm fine. I have plenty.

800
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:29,537
Excuse me?

801
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:33,792
I... I might have, uh, uh, drinken some.

802
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:35,217
Thank you.

803
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:37,881
May I have your canteen, please?

804
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,471
Oh, god.

805
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,812
Can you hear the empty spaces?

806
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,223
Yes, I can hear.

807
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:50,941
Fill it.

808
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,817
If that's too much trouble,

809
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:56,113
you can grab a shovel,
and Caveman here can fill the canteens.

810
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:57,981
Armpit! Squid!

811
00:42:58,159 --> 00:42:59,866
Get them wheelbarrows out of the truck!

812
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:01,944
Zero, you take over X-Ray's hole.

813
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,412
Caveman will assist you.

814
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:04,742
We're gonna dig this dirt twice.

815
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:07,950
Y'all be good now, you hear?

816
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:09,125
Get "C" and "F" over here.

817
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:10,748
Get "C" and "F" over here!

818
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,628
<i>I'm gonna be a wheel someday</i>

819
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:15,917
<i>I'm gonna be somebody</i>

820
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:17,460
Come on, boys, let's see it.

821
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:19,590
- Use those muscles.
<i>- I'm gonna be a real gone cat</i>

822
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:21,300
- Keep it up.
<i>- Then I won't want you</i>

823
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,098
This is a special day.
I got a good feeling about today.

824
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:27,682
There you go. I'm feeling some
double shower tokens, boys.

825
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,517
There'll be steaks
for dinner tonight.

826
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:31,557
- Keep it up.
<i>- Then I won't want you</i>

827
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:32,899
You're doing fine!

828
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:34,605
- No hurry.
<i>- You can cry</i>

829
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:36,023
We don't want to miss anything.

830
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:37,187
<i>While you were high high high</i>

831
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:39,027
- We don't want to miss nothing.
<i>- If you were wondering why</i>

832
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:40,365
<i>I don't look at you</i>

833
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:41,992
<i>When I go rolling by</i>

834
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,531
Pick every rock now.

835
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:44,949
Make sure it's a real rock.

836
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:47,782
- Caveman! Let's go!
<i>- Then I won't want you</i>

837
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:54,667
- Hey, how'd she know my name, man?
- Oh, she's got the whole place wired.

838
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:57,003
Oh, yeah, she's got these little, tiny
microphones and cameras

839
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:58,462
all over the place.

840
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:00,464
Yeah, she's got 'em in the rec room.

841
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:02,137
She's got 'em in the tent.

842
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:05,010
- She's got 'em in the showers.
- They're not in the showers.

843
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:07,392
Man, don't listen to him. I read his file.

844
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,975
It says he suffers from, um,
acute paranoia.

845
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:12,982
Hey, so that means
she watches me every day, huh?

846
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:16,485
Man, he says she got
cameras and microphones,

847
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:17,735
not microscopes.

848
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,487
Get outta here, man.

849
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:42,169
Okay, children, come back
first thing in the morning.

850
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,008
Okay? Rain or shine,
we're gonna have school.

851
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:45,259
Put your cap on.

852
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:46,969
Oh, here, take that, Louise.

853
00:44:47,143 --> 00:44:48,384
Bye, Miss Katherine.

854
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,427
See you tomorrow!

855
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:57,484
Hello, Miss Katherine.

856
00:44:58,404 --> 00:44:59,611
Hello, Sam.

857
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:02,902
I thought you might
still want some onions.

858
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:04,282
Thank you.

859
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:10,080
I can fix that.

860
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:12,206
Sam, are you gonna try to tell me now

861
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:15,039
that your onions are a cure
for a leaky roof?

862
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:16,249
Naw.

863
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,288
I'm just good with my hands.

864
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:20,590
I built my own boat, you know.

865
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:23,461
I needed to get across
the lake to my onion field.

866
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:26,881
Well, then, I guess you'd be
in real trouble if your boat leaked.

867
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:29,553
I tell you what,

868
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:31,222
I'll fix that roof

869
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:34,889
in exchange for three jars
of your spiced peaches.

870
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:40,269
It's a deal.

871
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:55,417
Well, Miss Katherine,

872
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,828
I guarantee that roof for five years.

873
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:00,289
If there's anything else...

874
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,916
The windows won't open.

875
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:05,844
And the children and I would
enjoy a breeze now and then.

876
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:07,925
I can fix that.

877
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:12,059
"And this maiden,
she lived with no other thought

878
00:46:12,228 --> 00:46:15,471
than to love and be loved by me.

879
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:19,649
She was a child, and I was a child

880
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:23,278
in this kingdom by the sea.

881
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:24,692
But we loved with..."

882
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:28,233
"With a love that was more than love,

883
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:30,944
I and my Annabel Lee."

884
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:33,159
Sam.

885
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:37,410
You know, that door
doesn't hang straight.

886
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:43,168
I can fix that.

887
00:46:43,676 --> 00:46:47,886
"The duck swims on the lake."

888
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,930
- Very good, Mr. Penn.
- Thank you, ma'am.

889
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:54,931
The d-duck may swim on the lake,

890
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:57,019
but my daddy owns the lake.

891
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:00,019
Tsk.

892
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:04,444
That will be all for tonight.

893
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:06,104
Thank you, class. You're dismissed.

894
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:07,989
Come on, boys.

895
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:10,533
Whew.

896
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:12,653
Hey, Katherine...

897
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,453
How about me and you,
uh, having a little picnic?

898
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:20,539
Take a ride on my motorboat.

899
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:22,371
No, thank you, Mr. Walker.

900
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:23,873
It's brand-new.

901
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:26,546
I mean, you don't even have to row it.

902
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:27,925
No, thank you.

903
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:29,503
Uh, come on now, girl.

904
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,716
Hey.

905
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:32,969
No one ever says no to Trout Walker.

906
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:35,592
I believe I just did.

907
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:50,823
Come on, boys.

908
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:53,076
We're digging around, all around.

909
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:55,658
Then we're digging toward the center, see?

910
00:47:56,332 --> 00:47:58,039
Got something to do with it, huh?

911
00:47:58,667 --> 00:47:59,908
Today's the day.

912
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:01,497
I can feel it.

913
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,753
You know,
the ancient Mesopotamians,

914
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,920
they didn't have shovels.

915
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:08,087
Glad to have you back, X-Ray.
We can use your sharp eyes.

916
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,296
Hello, Warden.

917
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:11,712
Ma'am, I think I found something.

918
00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:19,428
Are you trying to be funny?
Or do you just think I'm stupid?

919
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:24,186
No, ma'am, I... I wasn't
trying to be funny.

920
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:25,563
Excuse me?

921
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:29,947
Well, Armpit, your little joke
just cost you a week of shower privileges.

922
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:31,990
Aww.

923
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:34,193
All right. Everyone back to work.

924
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:36,487
- Man, you sleeping outside.
- You heard her, back to work.

925
00:48:36,664 --> 00:48:38,656
Aside from that,
everything's going real well.

926
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:40,574
I don't think so. I want results.

927
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:44,919
Sam, this is the finest schoolhouse
in all of Texas.

928
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:46,421
Thank you.

929
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:48,126
Thank you, Miss Katherine.

930
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:55,715
<i>Hello, my friend,
it's been a while</i>

931
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:02,229
<i>It's nice to see your beautiful smile</i>

932
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:06,850
<i>We went our separate ways</i>

933
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:10,771
<i>Only to return</i>

934
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:15,446
<i>To face a lesson</i>

935
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:19,036
<i>We failed to learn</i>

936
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:24,042
<i>We didn't understand the truth</i>

937
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:28,960
<i>We're blinded by the eyes of youth</i>

938
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:35,171
- Time kept on moving
- I can fix that.

939
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,848
<i>And the change has come</i>

940
00:49:39,018 --> 00:49:40,304
<i>The change has come</i>

941
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:43,937
<i>You think that I don't know</i>

942
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:47,315
<i>Where you're coming from</i>

943
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:51,645
<i>Well, I feel just like you</i>

944
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,404
<i>And I cry just like you</i>

945
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:55,236
<i>I cry</i>

946
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:57,071
<i>But I heal</i>

947
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:58,280
<i>Heal</i>

948
00:49:58,454 --> 00:50:00,320
<i>Just like you</i>

949
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:02,706
Come on. Ha!

950
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,540
<i>Under my skin</i>

951
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:05,959
<i>Under my skin</i>

952
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:09,496
<i>I'm just like you</i>

953
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:16,094
Four days.

954
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:18,050
Four long days.

955
00:50:18,224 --> 00:50:20,341
And this is all you jackasses got
to show for it.

956
00:50:20,935 --> 00:50:23,643
Probably ain't nothing down there.
We would have found it by now.

957
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:26,350
I wouldn't tell the queen bee that.

958
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:28,356
I ain't on stupid pills.

959
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:30,100
What are you jawing about?

960
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,768
If you can't get 'em to dig any faster,

961
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:34,191
you can grab a shovel and join 'em.

962
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:36,152
How about that? Huh?

963
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,690
Get to work!

964
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,951
This ain't no kindergartners
in the sandbox.

965
00:50:40,204 --> 00:50:41,866
I want to see some effort here

966
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:43,909
Or I'll put a hurt on you.

967
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:47,827
I ain't just whistling
"Bye-bye, sue" neither.

968
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:51,789
I am surrounded by cow turds.

969
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,836
Stop it! Stop it!

970
00:50:58,639 --> 00:50:59,846
Yeah!

971
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,427
Lady, where you going?

972
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:05,552
Stop it!

973
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,186
Do something!

974
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:08,514
Yeah, girl!

975
00:51:08,816 --> 00:51:10,148
How do you like me now?!

976
00:51:11,986 --> 00:51:13,022
Sheriff!

977
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:14,652
Sheriff! Come quick!

978
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:16,484
They're destroying the school!

979
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:21,777
Give me a kiss.

980
00:51:23,247 --> 00:51:24,579
You kissed the onion picker.

981
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:26,323
You're drunk.

982
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:28,955
I always get drunk before a hanging.

983
00:51:31,547 --> 00:51:32,754
If you hang him,

984
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:35,298
then you better hang me, too,

985
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,547
because I kissed him back.

986
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,921
It ain't against the law
for you to kiss him,

987
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:42,923
just for him to kiss you.

988
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,142
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

989
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:51,765
There she is!

990
00:51:52,151 --> 00:51:53,562
Come on now!

991
00:51:58,449 --> 00:51:59,565
Sam!

992
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,281
Sam!

993
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:18,967
Sam!

994
00:52:22,348 --> 00:52:23,964
Sam!

995
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,356
Listen up.

996
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:46,365
After the behavior exhibited
these past several days,

997
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,829
the Warden and I have decided

998
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:51,912
that your character-building
be best served

999
00:52:52,086 --> 00:52:55,670
by returning to the digging
of individual holes.

1000
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:58,999
Over to you.

1001
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:00,212
All right!

1002
00:53:00,386 --> 00:53:01,922
Let's go dig, boys!

1003
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,842
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

1004
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:16,315
Good morning, Sheriff.

1005
00:53:20,072 --> 00:53:21,734
Do you still want that kiss?

1006
00:53:55,858 --> 00:53:57,144
Water's the most
precious commodity

1007
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,191
on the face of the planet.

1008
00:53:59,528 --> 00:54:01,144
All life begins with water.

1009
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,442
So, think of it this way...

1010
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,657
I'm giving you life.

1011
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:08,235
Say "thank you."

1012
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:09,736
Thank you, Mr. Sir.

1013
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:11,029
Next!

1014
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:17,292
Don't get your hopes up.

1015
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,954
Them storms never make it
past the mountains.

1016
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:22,419
Maybe this time they will.

1017
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:25,794
I got a story for you girl scouts.

1018
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:30,093
Once upon a time,

1019
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:33,976
there was a magical place
where it never rained.

1020
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,021
The end.

1021
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:40,183
I don't get it.

1022
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,943
Have a nice day.

1023
00:54:47,201 --> 00:54:49,067
I never get anything he says.

1024
00:54:55,584 --> 00:54:57,917
Guys. Hey, guys.

1025
00:54:58,253 --> 00:54:59,243
What?

1026
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:01,128
Anybody want some sunflower seeds?

1027
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:03,085
Whoo!

1028
00:55:03,926 --> 00:55:05,792
I can't help it, man.
My hands are like magnets.

1029
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,255
Good old Magnet.

1030
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:08,840
Sticky fingers.

1031
00:55:09,598 --> 00:55:10,964
Pass it over here, man.

1032
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:12,556
Yeah, I'll take some of those. Whoo!

1033
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:14,842
Hey, Zig, come on, man. Hurry up.

1034
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:18,642
Mr. Sir's coming back.

1035
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:20,064
Hey, he's coming back!
He's coming back!

1036
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,106
Catch it.

1037
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,272
Oh, Stanley, you butterfingers!

1038
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:24,652
He's coming back.

1039
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,112
You better hide it.

1040
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:27,738
Hide it.

1041
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:29,365
Come on, man.

1042
00:55:56,979 --> 00:55:58,095
Well, well.

1043
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,725
How did this get here?

1044
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:01,980
What?

1045
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:03,857
How did that get there?

1046
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:07,312
Did it fall from the sky, huh?

1047
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:09,655
No.

1048
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:20,867
I stole that out of your truck.

1049
00:56:21,587 --> 00:56:24,421
I think maybe the Warden
would like to see what you found.

1050
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:26,999
Let's go.

1051
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:31,798
Y'all having a nice day?

1052
00:56:32,014 --> 00:56:33,801
- Yes, Mr. Sir.
- Good.

1053
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:35,882
Hey, what are you doing, Dog?

1054
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,051
- Caveman...
- See what turns up.

1055
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:43,436
What?

1056
00:56:43,692 --> 00:56:46,230
We found a little something
in Caveman's hole.

1057
00:56:46,987 --> 00:56:49,320
What is it? What'd you find?

1058
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:50,650
Come in. Come in.

1059
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:52,232
You're letting the cold out.

1060
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:56,820
Tell her.

1061
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:03,326
While Mr. Sir was filling our canteens...

1062
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:06,462
I snuck into his truck

1063
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:09,465
and, uh, stole his sunflower seeds.

1064
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:11,174
Yeah.

1065
00:57:12,304 --> 00:57:13,590
That's it.

1066
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:21,894
Caveman, would you,
uh, kindly bring me that little brass case

1067
00:57:22,064 --> 00:57:24,522
in the bureau over there
with my nail polish in it?

1068
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:25,772
Yeah, sure.

1069
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:35,859
Them little diddles think I
don't have eyes in the back of my head.

1070
00:57:36,495 --> 00:57:37,827
But I don't miss much,

1071
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:39,870
as you well know.

1072
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,747
You know, my philosophy is...

1073
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:46,707
See, I keep 'em in line,
punishment and reward.

1074
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:49,623
Punishment... Reward.

1075
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:51,299
Every time they see me coming,

1076
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:53,547
a little shiver goes up their spine.

1077
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:57,506
"D" tent, snaky little bunch, you know.

1078
00:57:57,683 --> 00:58:01,472
They think they're a step ahead of me,
but I'm miles ahead of them.

1079
00:58:01,645 --> 00:58:04,103
I come back at night. I look around.

1080
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:06,889
I see in their eyes. They know I know.

1081
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:08,649
Come right over here, son.

1082
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:10,651
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1083
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:13,863
See this, Caveman?

1084
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:18,659
This is my special nail polish.

1085
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:20,654
I make it myself.

1086
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:24,115
You want to know my secret ingredient?

1087
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:28,164
Rattlesnake venom.

1088
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,999
I just love what it does to the coloring.

1089
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:36,256
It's perfectly harmless.

1090
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:40,389
When it's dry.

1091
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:47,972
So, you think he stole
your sunflower seeds.

1092
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:49,724
No, I don't.

1093
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:52,815
I think he's covering
for X-Ray or somebody.

1094
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:56,572
It was a 5-pound sack,
and he claims to have eaten it all.

1095
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:58,524
But... but it
was only half full when I got it.

1096
00:58:58,702 --> 00:59:01,240
And, uh, there's a lot in my hole.
You could check that.

1097
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:03,993
I will. I will check it.

1098
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:07,704
Ah!

1099
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:09,164
Ah! Ah! Ah!

1100
00:59:09,755 --> 00:59:11,587
All I give you is respect and affection.

1101
00:59:11,757 --> 00:59:15,421
I suggest you go back to your hole now.

1102
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:16,877
Uh! Uh!

1103
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:19,967
Ohh! Why'd you do that? Ooh!

1104
00:59:20,432 --> 00:59:22,048
I liked you better when you smoked.

1105
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:24,350
Aah.

1106
00:59:26,188 --> 00:59:27,474
Hey, look who showed up.

1107
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:29,684
All right, man, we thought
you were dead for sure.

1108
00:59:29,858 --> 00:59:31,850
Hey, Caveman, what'd you say?

1109
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:33,980
Nothing.

1110
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:35,520
What'd she do to you?

1111
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:36,687
Nothing.

1112
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:39,235
Pbbtt. Nothing?

1113
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:40,866
Yeah. She didn't do nothing.

1114
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:44,991
What is this?

1115
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:47,532
Thank you, guys.

1116
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:49,791
Man.

1117
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:52,123
- Don't look at us.
- Yeah, it was Zero.

1118
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:54,163
That boy likes to dig holes.

1119
00:59:54,633 --> 00:59:57,091
- He'd dig a hole to China, man.
- Yeah, man.

1120
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,001
But where do them Chinese kids dig to?

1121
00:59:59,179 --> 01:00:00,465
Man, shut up.

1122
01:00:01,056 --> 01:00:02,137
Hey, Zero.

1123
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:03,468
Why'd you dig my hole, man?

1124
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:05,763
You didn't steal the sunflower seeds.

1125
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:07,430
Yeah, but neither did you.

1126
01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:11,723
You didn't steal the shoes.

1127
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:17,987
You still want to learn to read?

1128
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:21,611
All right, man.

1129
01:00:27,124 --> 01:00:29,912
I don't like no hocus-pocus.
$14 for onions.

1130
01:00:30,085 --> 01:00:31,496
We don't need no stinking onions.

1131
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:34,037
- You told me to get onions, I get onions.
- I want to taste it.

1132
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:36,373
- Go ahead and taste it. I don't care.
- I'll taste it then.

1133
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:38,583
Go ahead.
I'm tasting it.

1134
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:41,677
Whoa. What happened to your face?

1135
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:49,264
Something the matter with my face?
Huh?

1136
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:52,805
No. No, Mr. Sir.

1137
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:54,440
You got that right.

1138
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:01,898
Anybody see anything wrong
with my face?

1139
01:01:03,243 --> 01:01:04,233
Huh?!

1140
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:06,277
I think I'm kind of Purty, don't you?

1141
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:07,990
Yes, sir.

1142
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:15,081
Clean this up.

1143
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:21,876
I think we just learned a valuable lesson.

1144
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:27,219
We're all people, and Mr. Sir
is a very sensitive man,

1145
01:01:28,143 --> 01:01:29,179
just like all of us.

1146
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:33,266
<i>Leader, he's a mighty good leader</i>

1147
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:35,105
<i>He's a mighty good leader</i>

1148
01:01:35,317 --> 01:01:36,398
Next.

1149
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:39,143
<i>All the way</i>

1150
01:01:39,321 --> 01:01:41,278
<i>All the way, lord</i>

1151
01:01:41,448 --> 01:01:42,438
<i>From up to heaven</i>

1152
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:43,732
You thirsty, Yelnats?

1153
01:01:43,909 --> 01:01:45,866
- Yes, Mr. Sir.
<i>- He's a mighty good leader</i>

1154
01:02:00,467 --> 01:02:02,208
There. That should hold you.

1155
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:03,466
Next!

1156
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:25,155
Magnet, wipe that
smile off your face.

1157
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:26,986
Yes, you.

1158
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:29,451
You want some water?

1159
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:35,123
Remember that gold tube?

1160
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:37,243
Yeah.

1161
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:39,495
I think that that tube...

1162
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:43,549
was a tube of lipstick, you know?

1163
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:46,552
And the "K.B." stands for Kate Barlow.

1164
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:49,380
Kissin' Kate Barlow?

1165
01:02:50,934 --> 01:02:52,391
Kissin' Kate Barlow.

1166
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:56,433
<i>I've done a lot of things
that I'm not so proud of</i>

1167
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:58,848
<i>Took a lot of turns</i>

1168
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:02,189
<i>That turned out wrong</i>

1169
01:03:02,362 --> 01:03:05,321
<i>That's a worn-out song</i>

1170
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:10,284
<i>Day by day, moment by moment</i>

1171
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:12,445
<i>Takin' my chances</i>

1172
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:16,332
<i>Trustin' my heart</i>

1173
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:19,289
<i>It wasn't too smart</i>

1174
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:22,796
<i>I will survive, I will endure</i>

1175
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:26,084
<i>When the going's rough, you can be sure</i>

1176
01:03:26,261 --> 01:03:29,629
<i>I'll tough it out, I won't give in</i>

1177
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:34,267
<i>If I'm knocked down, I'll get up again</i>

1178
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:39,518
<i>As long as my dream's alive</i>

1179
01:03:39,691 --> 01:03:43,810
<i>I will survive</i>

1180
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:49,486
<i>I will survive</i>

1181
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:51,321
All right. Come on now.

1182
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:53,360
"z"... "e"...

1183
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:54,744
Okay.

1184
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:57,031
"r"...

1185
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,240
"o."

1186
01:03:58,376 --> 01:03:59,366
That's it.

1187
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:03,211
I can help you dig your hole
so you won't be so tired to teach me.

1188
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:04,667
No, I'm fine.

1189
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:06,798
Look, you're a slow digger.

1190
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:09,468
Oh ho ho.
You're trying to bag on me.

1191
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,716
Yeah, I'm trying to bag on you.
All right.

1192
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:13,426
This way, we'll be done at the same time.

1193
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:15,345
- Well, it couldn't hurt.
- Yeah.

1194
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:16,971
Go ahead.

1195
01:04:19,606 --> 01:04:20,596
"z"...

1196
01:04:20,774 --> 01:04:21,810
"z"...

1197
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:23,478
"e"...

1198
01:04:24,069 --> 01:04:25,059
No.

1199
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,357
This has to go out like this.
That's an "r."

1200
01:04:27,489 --> 01:04:28,775
- Okay.
- Okay?

1201
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:30,530
his one's easy. "o."

1202
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:33,576
That's it.

1203
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:36,320
You know, Zero's not my real name.

1204
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:39,415
It's not?

1205
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:41,412
But even Pendanski calls you "Zero."

1206
01:04:41,586 --> 01:04:44,078
My name's Hector, Hector Zeroni.

1207
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:45,875
Hector Zeroni.

1208
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:48,002
Nice to meet you, Hector.

1209
01:04:48,176 --> 01:04:50,213
Nice to meet you.

1210
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:53,255
26 letters. So, we can do
five letters a day for four days,

1211
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:54,922
and then six letters on the fifth day.

1212
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:56,131
That's good math.

1213
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:58,517
I'm not stupid.
I know everyone thinks I am.

1214
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:00,978
I just don't like answering
stupid questions.

1215
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:02,137
Right.

1216
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:04,728
Yo, Caveman, it must be kind of easy

1217
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:07,814
working with your own personal
slave and all, huh?

1218
01:05:08,655 --> 01:05:09,896
What's up, stupid?

1219
01:05:11,533 --> 01:05:12,740
Come on, Squid.

1220
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:14,782
Whatever, man.

1221
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:20,827
"m"...

1222
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:23,162
"o"...

1223
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:25,919
"m."

1224
01:05:32,303 --> 01:05:33,544
We weren't always homeless.

1225
01:05:35,974 --> 01:05:38,387
I remember we used to live
in a lot of different places.

1226
01:05:40,145 --> 01:05:41,261
And then...

1227
01:05:42,272 --> 01:05:43,558
We didn't live anywhere.

1228
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:49,394
It must have been hard.

1229
01:05:49,821 --> 01:05:50,902
Yeah.

1230
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:53,113
My ma had problems,

1231
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:55,741
but she would try so hard to
make a better life for us.

1232
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:56,991
Yeah.

1233
01:05:57,370 --> 01:06:00,158
She always used to say,
"I love you more than air."

1234
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:03,456
She couldn't take me everywhere she went.

1235
01:06:04,252 --> 01:06:07,370
I used to have to wait like
on a porch or a playground.

1236
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:11,336
Then one day, she didn't come back.

1237
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:16,966
What happened to her?

1238
01:06:19,851 --> 01:06:21,638
I don't know.

1239
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:23,890
That's what bothers me the most.

1240
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:25,975
If I could,

1241
01:06:26,316 --> 01:06:28,478
I would hire a whole team
of private investigators

1242
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:29,858
just to find her...

1243
01:06:30,904 --> 01:06:32,566
or to find out what happened to her.

1244
01:06:34,741 --> 01:06:37,233
I used to wait at Laney Park.

1245
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:39,985
Laney Park?

1246
01:06:40,163 --> 01:06:41,153
Yeah.

1247
01:06:41,289 --> 01:06:42,905
I used to go to Laney park all the time.

1248
01:06:43,041 --> 01:06:44,077
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1249
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:47,159
I used to sleep in the tunnel
next to the swinging bridge.

1250
01:06:49,923 --> 01:06:51,084
But no biggie.

1251
01:06:55,178 --> 01:06:57,010
Let's go, boys! Lunch!

1252
01:06:57,180 --> 01:06:58,387
Where's your whip, Caveman?

1253
01:06:58,556 --> 01:07:00,468
You don't want your slave
to be slacking off.

1254
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:02,091
It's not slavery.
It's an agreement.

1255
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:03,509
Yeah, man, whatever.

1256
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:06,387
Line 'em up. I don't have all
day. Let's go. Let's go.

1257
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:10,478
We have bologna and cheese,
apples, and graham crackers.

1258
01:07:10,568 --> 01:07:11,604
All right, let's move it along.

1259
01:07:11,778 --> 01:07:13,770
- Get your sandwich.
- Hello, Theodore.

1260
01:07:13,947 --> 01:07:15,438
That's not my name, fool. It's Armpit.

1261
01:07:15,615 --> 01:07:17,197
Uh-huh. Alan, a good day to you.

1262
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:18,273
Good afternoon.

1263
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:20,071
- Ricky...
- Sir.

1264
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:21,906
Sandwiches?

1265
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:23,662
You can have one sandwich.

1266
01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:25,413
This is America.
We speak English here.

1267
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:27,916
Hey, man, I got some
extra graham crackers.

1268
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:32,838
Hey, how about I give you my cookie
and you let me dig your hole?

1269
01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:37,502
Go on. Take it.

1270
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:41,343
Look, I get it, all right?
I'll dig my own hole from now on.

1271
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:42,590
Just let me eat my lunch.

1272
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:45,134
He isn't gonna take it.
Come here.

1273
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:46,514
Eat the cookie.

1274
01:07:46,688 --> 01:07:48,054
Whoa.

1275
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:49,938
Back off, man.

1276
01:07:50,108 --> 01:07:52,600
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
What's going on here?

1277
01:07:52,777 --> 01:07:55,394
Nothing, Mom.
We was just fooling, right?

1278
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:57,985
I saw what was going on.
Go on, Stanley.

1279
01:07:58,157 --> 01:07:59,773
Teach him a lesson.
Hit him back.

1280
01:07:59,951 --> 01:08:01,908
- Yeah, teach me a lesson.
- Yeah, Stanley, teach him a lesson.

1281
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:03,535
- Come on. Hit me.
- Hit him.

1282
01:08:03,705 --> 01:08:06,322
- Come on. Teach me a lesson.
- Hit him, Stanley.

1283
01:08:11,296 --> 01:08:12,457
Get him!

1284
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:13,666
All right, all right.

1285
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:15,498
Ugh!

1286
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:16,916
Go get him.

1287
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:18,167
Awww.

1288
01:08:19,053 --> 01:08:20,840
That's enough!

1289
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:24,715
I said, "That's enough!"

1290
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:27,013
That's enough!

1291
01:08:27,228 --> 01:08:29,436
Stop. Hey, stop, Zero. Hey, stop.

1292
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:31,518
Come on, man.

1293
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:37,652
Now, I said, "that's enough!"

1294
01:08:38,323 --> 01:08:40,315
When I say to end something,
I mean end it.

1295
01:08:40,491 --> 01:08:42,448
- Come on. Let's go.
- Get back to your holes!

1296
01:08:44,037 --> 01:08:46,029
- You all right?
- Zero's crazy.

1297
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:47,491
No, no, no. Leave me alone.

1298
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:51,617
Basically, Zero almost killed Ricky.

1299
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:52,830
Basically?

1300
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:55,037
Uh, uh, Ziggy was beating up
the Caveman, right?

1301
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:57,373
And then Zero started choking Zigzag.

1302
01:08:57,550 --> 01:08:59,132
I had to pull Zero off of him.

1303
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:02,302
Yeah, I mean, you know,
Zig just got a little hot.

1304
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:04,634
Out in the sun all day,
the blood starts to boil.

1305
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:06,514
Is that what happened, Zigzag?

1306
01:09:06,768 --> 01:09:08,100
Yep.

1307
01:09:08,311 --> 01:09:09,597
Like X-Ray said, you know,

1308
01:09:09,771 --> 01:09:12,309
working all day
out in the hot sun, you know,

1309
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:13,889
while Caveman sits around
and does nothing.

1310
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:15,269
Excuse me?

1311
01:09:15,443 --> 01:09:17,685
Caveman digs his hole
just like everyone else.

1312
01:09:17,862 --> 01:09:18,852
Sometimes.

1313
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:20,024
Excuse me?

1314
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:23,823
Ma'am, Zero's been digging
a part of Caveman's hole every day.

1315
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:25,776
You're not digging holes no more?

1316
01:09:26,371 --> 01:09:27,452
Huh?

1317
01:09:27,538 --> 01:09:29,074
I... I'm teaching him how to read.

1318
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:30,868
What?

1319
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:32,332
He's a smart kid.

1320
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:33,993
Smart?

1321
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:35,160
Oh, yeah?

1322
01:09:35,338 --> 01:09:40,379
Hey, Zero, what does c-a-t spell?

1323
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:41,667
Huh?

1324
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:43,385
What's it spell?

1325
01:09:44,138 --> 01:09:45,504
Yeah, he's a real genius.

1326
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:48,015
He's so stupid,
he doesn't even know he's stupid.

1327
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:49,846
Okay, from now on,

1328
01:09:49,977 --> 01:09:53,015
I don't want anyone
digging anyone else's hole.

1329
01:09:53,231 --> 01:09:54,517
Is that clear?

1330
01:09:54,691 --> 01:09:56,273
And no more reading lessons.

1331
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:58,855
Why? I mean, if the hole gets dug,
who cares who's digging it, right?

1332
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:00,894
You know why you're digging holes?!

1333
01:10:01,072 --> 01:10:03,029
'cause it's good for you.
It teaches you a lesson.

1334
01:10:03,241 --> 01:10:06,985
If Zero digs your hole for you,
you're not learning your lesson, are you?

1335
01:10:07,161 --> 01:10:08,618
Yeah. See that?

1336
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:10,863
Why can't I still just dig my hole
and teach him how to read?

1337
01:10:11,916 --> 01:10:13,157
'cause I said so.

1338
01:10:13,334 --> 01:10:15,291
We know you mean well, Stanley.

1339
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:17,123
But the mental stress

1340
01:10:17,296 --> 01:10:19,788
just causes his brain too much
of a challenge.

1341
01:10:19,966 --> 01:10:22,709
That's what made his blood boil,
not the hot sun.

1342
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:24,926
I'm not digging any more holes.

1343
01:10:25,012 --> 01:10:26,048
Good.

1344
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:30,056
I mean, you might as well
teach this shovel to read.

1345
01:10:30,393 --> 01:10:32,009
Go ahead, Zero. Take it.

1346
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:34,436
It's all you'll ever be good for.

1347
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,102
D-i-g.

1348
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:38,272
What's that spell?

1349
01:10:40,403 --> 01:10:41,393
Uhh!

1350
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:42,982
Ohh!

1351
01:10:44,741 --> 01:10:45,777
Dig.

1352
01:10:48,536 --> 01:10:51,074
Go, Zero! Go!

1353
01:10:51,706 --> 01:10:53,914
- Run, Zero!
- Don't shoot!

1354
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:55,958
He can't go anywhere.

1355
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:57,413
You think I was gonna shoot him?

1356
01:10:57,587 --> 01:11:00,500
The last thing we need
is an investigation.

1357
01:11:00,673 --> 01:11:01,663
I know that.

1358
01:11:01,841 --> 01:11:03,127
Misinterpretation.

1359
01:11:03,301 --> 01:11:05,588
Let him go, then. Let him go.

1360
01:11:05,762 --> 01:11:08,880
I want round-the-clock guards
on all water sources.

1361
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:20,023
I still expect seven holes.

1362
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:25,438
I'll have the chicken tenders, Warden.

1363
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:31,075
I'm a heel. I'm a heel.

1364
01:11:31,162 --> 01:11:33,245
I'm feeling queasy. Take it or leave it.

1365
01:11:33,414 --> 01:11:34,825
You still pouting?

1366
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:37,040
No, I'm not pouting.

1367
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:40,749
I'm just asking,
are we sure that he had no family?

1368
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:42,917
He was a ward of the state.

1369
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:45,127
He was living on the streets
when he was arrested.

1370
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:48,135
Is there some prissy caseworker
who might ask questions?

1371
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:51,092
He had nobody. He was nobody.

1372
01:11:51,265 --> 01:11:53,302
I want you to destroy his records.

1373
01:11:53,476 --> 01:11:54,808
He was never here.

1374
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:57,139
Can you get into the state files
from our computer?

1375
01:11:57,313 --> 01:12:01,603
I can do anything, but I'm telling you,
no one is going to come looking for him.

1376
01:12:01,818 --> 01:12:04,652
No one cares about Hector Zeroni.

1377
01:12:11,828 --> 01:12:12,944
I do.

1378
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:17,789
They was in this thing together.

1379
01:12:19,085 --> 01:12:20,166
Yeah.

1380
01:12:27,385 --> 01:12:29,172
His blood's on your hands, then.

1381
01:12:42,316 --> 01:12:43,648
Man, if he's not back by morning,

1382
01:12:43,901 --> 01:12:45,187
he's dead.

1383
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:46,602
He's dead either way.

1384
01:12:47,655 --> 01:12:49,692
If he stays out there or if he comes back.

1385
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:51,653
When do you think
they're gonna find his body?

1386
01:12:52,076 --> 01:12:53,237
What body?

1387
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:55,702
Man, Zero's buzzard food.

1388
01:12:55,955 --> 01:12:56,945
You know what?

1389
01:12:57,456 --> 01:12:59,197
They pick out the eyeballs first.

1390
01:12:59,834 --> 01:13:01,700
I can't believe you just said that.

1391
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:08,047
Learn how to take a joke.

1392
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:15,339
<i>She left him
stranded in the desert.</i>

1393
01:13:15,892 --> 01:13:18,930
No water, no food for 16 days.

1394
01:13:20,563 --> 01:13:22,555
Well, grandpa, how'd he survive?

1395
01:13:22,982 --> 01:13:25,599
They said he found refuge on God's Thumb.

1396
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:28,310
<i>- What's God's Thumb?
- Who knows.</i>

1397
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:31,028
<i>He was half crazy when they found him.</i>

1398
01:13:42,376 --> 01:13:43,742
Zero!

1399
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:49,672
Zero!

1400
01:14:05,566 --> 01:14:06,852
Zero!

1401
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:16,365
So, what you in here for, Twitch?

1402
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:18,030
Oh, ha, joyriding.

1403
01:14:18,788 --> 01:14:20,825
I guess you never really plan
to steal one or nothing,

1404
01:14:20,957 --> 01:14:22,698
but when I walk past
a really nice car...

1405
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:24,829
Whoo! Oh... I just start twitching,
you know?

1406
01:14:25,002 --> 01:14:27,369
Really kind of...
well, you think I'm jumpy now?

1407
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:29,622
You should have seen me behind the wheel
of that mustang convertible.

1408
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:31,085
Whoo! Vroom!

1409
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:38,839
Come on, Twitch. Let's go.

1410
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:43,890
Hey, Twitch, get some water.

1411
01:14:44,814 --> 01:14:46,396
I'm getting tired...

1412
01:14:46,565 --> 01:14:47,806
First hole's the hardest.

1413
01:14:47,942 --> 01:14:48,728
Thanks, man.

1414
01:14:48,818 --> 01:14:51,231
If you see me coming,
I want you to jump out of that hole.

1415
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:54,028
Be first in line right away.

1416
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:56,906
I'm a little scratchy today,
so you got to be sensitive with me.

1417
01:14:57,076 --> 01:14:59,489
- Yeah, I apologize, Mr. Sir.
- Yeah, yeah.

1418
01:14:59,662 --> 01:15:01,904
Hey, man, I'm sick and tired
of you cutting in line.

1419
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:03,322
Man.

1420
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:04,410
Chill out.

1421
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,457
- What's wrong with you?
- We all getting water.

1422
01:15:06,544 --> 01:15:07,375
What? What?

1423
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:09,327
Don't be squabbling up in here.
Both of us getting it.

1424
01:15:13,259 --> 01:15:15,125
Gentlemen, there's
only one law around here

1425
01:15:15,302 --> 01:15:16,463
and that's me.

1426
01:15:16,846 --> 01:15:18,553
You guys want to learn
the tough lessons? Here.

1427
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:20,596
I'll give you a tough-guy...

1428
01:15:21,142 --> 01:15:22,349
Come on. Come on. Put it in gear.

1429
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:24,305
Hey! Wait!

1430
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:25,844
Aaaah!

1431
01:15:27,982 --> 01:15:29,393
Wwaahhh!

1432
01:15:35,281 --> 01:15:37,364
You stop this truck...

1433
01:15:39,452 --> 01:15:40,863
Or I'll kill you!

1434
01:15:44,498 --> 01:15:45,579
Wuh!

1435
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:50,627
Keep going, Caveman!

1436
01:15:50,755 --> 01:15:53,372
Yelnats! Stop that truck!

1437
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:54,539
Yelnats!

1438
01:15:57,136 --> 01:15:59,378
Bye-bye, Camp Green...

1439
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:04,382
My truck.

1440
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:05,926
You okay? Caveman!

1441
01:16:08,522 --> 01:16:09,808
You all right?

1442
01:16:15,905 --> 01:16:18,192
You done it now!
You done it now!

1443
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:22,363
Get back away from that truck!

1444
01:16:22,536 --> 01:16:23,652
Get away from the truck.

1445
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:27,747
Yeah!

1446
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:30,875
Keep going! Don't stop!

1447
01:16:31,045 --> 01:16:32,832
Yeah, keep going!

1448
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:35,088
There ain't gonna be no Yelnats V!

1449
01:16:51,982 --> 01:16:53,098
Whoa.

1450
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:59,195
No, senor. Not for me.

1451
01:17:04,078 --> 01:17:06,286
I'm not gonna see
what's not there.

1452
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:08,538
All right,
fill in this section here

1453
01:17:08,707 --> 01:17:10,824
and start digging over there in between.

1454
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:12,583
What are you gonna do about Caveman?

1455
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:15,252
He ain't like Zero. He's got family.

1456
01:17:15,923 --> 01:17:18,586
In two weeks, we'll report he's run away.

1457
01:17:19,135 --> 01:17:22,299
Call in dogs, helicopters,
the whole nine yards.

1458
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:24,963
By then, there will be
nothing left to find.

1459
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:27,594
That's exactly right.

1460
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:22,444
Zero?

1461
01:18:26,202 --> 01:18:27,283
Zero?

1462
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:37,001
Huh?

1463
01:18:37,838 --> 01:18:39,045
Stanley.

1464
01:18:39,173 --> 01:18:40,334
What's up, man?

1465
01:18:41,342 --> 01:18:42,458
- How you doing?
- All right.

1466
01:18:42,635 --> 01:18:43,671
Oh!

1467
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,006
We thought you were gone.

1468
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:47,216
I was.

1469
01:18:47,389 --> 01:18:49,506
Let me see. You don't look too bad.

1470
01:18:49,683 --> 01:18:50,969
You got any water?

1471
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:53,305
- No. I'm out.
- Oh.

1472
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:55,182
But, hey, you know the water truck?

1473
01:18:55,356 --> 01:18:57,769
I tried to drive the whole thing
over here. I drove it into a hole.

1474
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:00,229
Figures.

1475
01:19:00,903 --> 01:19:02,064
What's in the bag?

1476
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:03,732
Oh, it's empty.

1477
01:19:05,115 --> 01:19:06,151
No.

1478
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:11,945
Zero, we got to get back to camp.

1479
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:15,582
I'm not going back.

1480
01:19:17,962 --> 01:19:19,123
Want some Sploosh?

1481
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:20,245
Some what?

1482
01:19:20,714 --> 01:19:21,875
Sploosh.

1483
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:23,915
Come on, follow me. I'll show you.

1484
01:19:24,301 --> 01:19:25,792
- Some w...
- Come on.

1485
01:19:28,055 --> 01:19:29,512
Can't you get a door?

1486
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:31,798
This is how I found it.

1487
01:19:37,815 --> 01:19:39,272
Here.

1488
01:19:41,735 --> 01:19:42,725
What is this?

1489
01:19:42,903 --> 01:19:44,519
Sploosh. That's what I call it.

1490
01:19:44,697 --> 01:19:46,484
Drink it. It's good.

1491
01:19:56,542 --> 01:19:57,703
That is pretty good.

1492
01:19:57,876 --> 01:19:59,583
- Yeah.
- Tastes like peaches.

1493
01:19:59,837 --> 01:20:01,123
How many of these you got left?

1494
01:20:01,297 --> 01:20:03,505
That's the last one.

1495
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:06,963
We need to go back to camp.

1496
01:20:07,303 --> 01:20:10,171
Okay? So, let's wrap it up, get your bag,
put this in there, and we'll go.

1497
01:20:10,347 --> 01:20:11,428
I'm not going back.

1498
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:15,175
You will die out here.

1499
01:20:16,395 --> 01:20:18,227
Here's what we're gonna do. Okay?

1500
01:20:18,605 --> 01:20:20,062
We're gonna go back to camp.

1501
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:24,059
And we're gonna tell the Warden exactly
where I found Kate Barlow's lipstick tube.

1502
01:20:24,236 --> 01:20:25,477
And she'll be so happy,

1503
01:20:25,612 --> 01:20:27,194
We won't get in any trouble.

1504
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:29,940
Okay?

1505
01:20:33,912 --> 01:20:35,528
What's "mare-yelo"?

1506
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:39,207
What are you talking about?

1507
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:41,501
Mare-yelo.

1508
01:20:42,629 --> 01:20:43,915
I don't know.

1509
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:45,959
Come on, dude.

1510
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:48,295
Come on.

1511
01:20:53,474 --> 01:20:54,464
See?

1512
01:20:55,225 --> 01:20:56,966
- Oh, it's "Mary Lou."
- Oh.

1513
01:20:57,561 --> 01:20:59,302
But I thought "y" made the "Yuh" sound.

1514
01:20:59,438 --> 01:21:01,100
Yeah, well, it does
at the beginning of a word,

1515
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:02,522
but not at the end of a...

1516
01:21:03,776 --> 01:21:04,812
Word.

1517
01:21:06,445 --> 01:21:07,777
See that mountain right there?

1518
01:21:08,238 --> 01:21:09,604
- That one?
- Yeah.

1519
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:11,230
Huh.

1520
01:21:11,408 --> 01:21:12,865
What does that look like to you?

1521
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,917
You know,
my great-grandpa almost died out here.

1522
01:21:27,091 --> 01:21:28,582
- Really?
- Yeah.

1523
01:21:28,759 --> 01:21:31,502
<i>But they say he survived because he
made it to the top of God's Thumb.</i>

1524
01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:38,637
- You ready?
- It's a long way.

1525
01:21:38,811 --> 01:21:40,973
- Yeah. We better get up before dark.
- Yeah.

1526
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:50,061
<i>All our dreams are gone</i>

1527
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:52,447
<i>With a loss of faith</i>

1528
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:54,657
<i>And we're still hanging on</i>

1529
01:21:54,827 --> 01:21:56,534
Hey, Stanley.
What do you think's up there?

1530
01:21:56,703 --> 01:21:57,739
<i>Through another day</i>

1531
01:21:57,913 --> 01:21:59,620
Oh, I don't know.
Probably a great, big frosty-freeze.

1532
01:21:59,790 --> 01:22:00,997
<i>It's so hard to see</i>

1533
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:02,452
Good. I could use a hot-fudge sundae.

1534
01:22:02,543 --> 01:22:04,830
- <i>That it's gonna get better</i>
- You know what I keep thinking about?

1535
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:06,752
Imagine how fine this
Mary Lou probably looked in a bikini.

1536
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:08,038
<i>But when will that be?</i>

1537
01:22:08,215 --> 01:22:10,252
- Oh!
<i>- It's hard to say</i>

1538
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:11,542
Whoa.

1539
01:22:13,262 --> 01:22:16,130
<i>Don't give up never give up</i>

1540
01:22:16,306 --> 01:22:19,265
<i>We won't stop givin' all we got</i>

1541
01:22:19,435 --> 01:22:22,178
<i>Don't give up never give up</i>

1542
01:22:22,354 --> 01:22:25,392
<i>We won't stop givin' all we got</i>

1543
01:22:25,566 --> 01:22:28,434
<i>Don't give up never give up</i>

1544
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:30,567
<i>We won't stop givin'</i>

1545
01:22:30,737 --> 01:22:31,727
<i>- All we got</i>
- Come on!

1546
01:22:31,905 --> 01:22:34,898
<i>Don't give up never give up</i>

1547
01:22:35,075 --> 01:22:37,818
<i>- We won't stop givin' all we got</i>
- Don't look down, man.

1548
01:22:38,662 --> 01:22:39,778
Oh, my god.

1549
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:42,117
You okay?
Come on, Stanley. You can do it.

1550
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:43,623
- Okay.
- Come on.

1551
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:45,203
Okay. I'm coming.

1552
01:22:46,503 --> 01:22:49,086
- You grab right there?
- Yeah, look. That's where I got.

1553
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,047
Whoa!

1554
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:52,252
Whoa! No, no, no, no! No.

1555
01:22:52,426 --> 01:22:54,668
Come on, come on, come on! Come on!

1556
01:23:11,278 --> 01:23:12,814
Oh!

1557
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:16,315
Whoo!

1558
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:19,150
Oh!

1559
01:23:19,495 --> 01:23:20,576
Look at that.

1560
01:23:21,455 --> 01:23:22,821
Look at this, man.

1561
01:23:23,665 --> 01:23:25,577
- This isn't cool.
- What happened?

1562
01:23:28,378 --> 01:23:29,994
All right, hold on.

1563
01:23:35,677 --> 01:23:37,384
- Aah!
- Is it numb or is it stinging?

1564
01:23:37,554 --> 01:23:38,761
It stings, man.

1565
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:41,305
Don't think about it now.
When we get to the top of the mountain,

1566
01:23:41,391 --> 01:23:42,882
I'm gonna get you a hot-fudge sundae,
all right?

1567
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:44,596
- I promise.
- Good.

1568
01:23:45,395 --> 01:23:47,261
All that Sploosh is getting to me.

1569
01:23:49,942 --> 01:23:51,274
Maybe he found Zero.

1570
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:53,692
Maybe they're both still alive.

1571
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:57,489
Maybe the Easter bunny
and the tooth fairy are still alive too.

1572
01:23:57,658 --> 01:23:58,648
Yeah.

1573
01:23:58,825 --> 01:24:01,784
Maybe my Mom will stop drinking
and my dad will come home.

1574
01:24:02,496 --> 01:24:05,034
Man, when Caveman stole that truck...

1575
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:07,616
That was awesome.

1576
01:24:08,126 --> 01:24:09,242
Yeah, man.

1577
01:24:09,795 --> 01:24:11,411
Caveman did have style.

1578
01:24:12,673 --> 01:24:13,663
Give me another word.

1579
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,957
R-o-c-k.

1580
01:24:16,134 --> 01:24:17,625
R-rock?

1581
01:24:18,387 --> 01:24:20,253
Yep, that's right, man.
You're doing good.

1582
01:24:22,558 --> 01:24:24,675
Keep practicing.

1583
01:24:26,228 --> 01:24:28,311
We're almost there. Come on.

1584
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:30,600
You all right?

1585
01:24:31,942 --> 01:24:32,932
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1586
01:24:33,110 --> 01:24:34,226
Zero!

1587
01:24:35,696 --> 01:24:38,109
Zero, Zero, Zero, Zero!
Got you, got you, got you!

1588
01:24:38,282 --> 01:24:40,444
Got you. You good?
You good? Hold on.

1589
01:24:40,617 --> 01:24:43,234
All right. All right.
All right, hold on.

1590
01:24:43,412 --> 01:24:46,029
Hold on. Let me get in front of you.
Stay right there.

1591
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:47,656
Stay right there.

1592
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:49,074
Okay. Here.

1593
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:53,123
Slide this down. Okay. All right.

1594
01:24:53,505 --> 01:24:54,746
There you go.

1595
01:24:56,008 --> 01:24:58,591
Nice and comfy.

1596
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:00,001
Stanley...

1597
01:25:00,178 --> 01:25:01,794
I got to tell you something, man.

1598
01:25:01,972 --> 01:25:04,510
What?

1599
01:25:07,394 --> 01:25:08,384
Huh?

1600
01:25:08,562 --> 01:25:09,928
Come on, Zero.

1601
01:25:10,063 --> 01:25:11,053
Zero, Zero.

1602
01:25:15,569 --> 01:25:17,356
All right. We can't sit here.

1603
01:25:17,487 --> 01:25:18,978
Got to keep going.

1604
01:25:19,156 --> 01:25:20,863
We're gonna go get the shovel,

1605
01:25:21,033 --> 01:25:23,320
and we're gonna fill it full of ice cream.

1606
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:27,738
<i>You must carry
Madame Zeroni up the mountain</i>

1607
01:25:27,914 --> 01:25:29,655
<i>and sing while I drink</i>

1608
01:25:30,208 --> 01:25:32,746
<i>so I can get strong, too.</i>

1609
01:25:52,856 --> 01:25:54,643
Damn bugs.

1610
01:25:57,611 --> 01:25:59,068
All right.

1611
01:26:00,864 --> 01:26:02,105
Wait a minute...

1612
01:26:03,075 --> 01:26:04,156
Wait.

1613
01:26:05,035 --> 01:26:07,322
If there's bugs, that must mean there's...

1614
01:26:11,667 --> 01:26:12,953
...water.

1615
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:19,334
Hector, wake up, man!

1616
01:26:19,508 --> 01:26:20,840
Hector, wake up!

1617
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:23,171
All right, buddy. All right.

1618
01:26:23,345 --> 01:26:24,552
There we go.

1619
01:26:24,721 --> 01:26:26,508
Wake up, Hector, huh?

1620
01:26:33,313 --> 01:26:36,306
Hector, wake up. Wake up.

1621
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:39,066
Ooh!

1622
01:26:39,236 --> 01:26:40,852
Oh! Oh!

1623
01:26:42,948 --> 01:26:44,940
Dude, this feels so good!

1624
01:26:46,118 --> 01:26:47,825
We made it!

1625
01:26:48,036 --> 01:26:49,197
Stanley!

1626
01:26:49,496 --> 01:26:50,737
Ah, ha ha!
Hector, we made it, buddy!

1627
01:26:50,914 --> 01:26:52,371
Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1628
01:26:52,541 --> 01:26:54,157
Cool, cool, cool!

1629
01:27:00,424 --> 01:27:01,414
What are you doing?

1630
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:08,797
Here, try this.

1631
01:27:09,516 --> 01:27:10,597
Try this.

1632
01:27:11,768 --> 01:27:12,758
What is it?

1633
01:27:12,936 --> 01:27:14,393
It's a hot-fudge sundae. Just eat it.

1634
01:27:17,357 --> 01:27:18,768
- It's good, huh?
- Mmm. Yeah!

1635
01:27:19,943 --> 01:27:22,026
That's the sweetest onion I ever tasted.

1636
01:27:23,029 --> 01:27:24,065
Mmm.

1637
01:27:26,533 --> 01:27:30,368
<i>"If only, if only,"
the woodpecker sighs,</i>

1638
01:27:31,079 --> 01:27:34,868
<i>"the bark on the tree
was as soft as the skies."</i>

1639
01:27:35,041 --> 01:27:39,251
<i>As the wolf waits below hungry and lonely</i>

1640
01:27:39,421 --> 01:27:42,960
<i>Cries to the moon, "if only, if only."</i>

1641
01:27:44,342 --> 01:27:48,586
<i>"If only, if only," the woodpecker...</i>

1642
01:28:21,963 --> 01:28:23,170
Honey...

1643
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:25,798
- Would you smell the shoe?
- Oh, my god, honey.

1644
01:28:25,967 --> 01:28:27,424
Can't you just wait
till I'm finished eating?

1645
01:28:27,511 --> 01:28:30,254
I know I've asked you a million times.
Just a million and one more.

1646
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:31,637
Smell the shoe.

1647
01:28:32,974 --> 01:28:35,261
- Honey, I don't smell anything.
- What?

1648
01:28:37,813 --> 01:28:38,974
I don't smell anything.

1649
01:28:39,231 --> 01:28:40,347
Uh-huh.

1650
01:28:40,607 --> 01:28:42,473
Pa... What do you smell?

1651
01:28:42,859 --> 01:28:43,849
Nothing.

1652
01:28:44,069 --> 01:28:46,186
Peaches and onions.
That's the secret.

1653
01:28:46,363 --> 01:28:47,774
I don't smell anything.

1654
01:28:47,948 --> 01:28:49,234
You don't smell anything.

1655
01:28:49,407 --> 01:28:51,740
- I don't smell anything.
- Whoo.

1656
01:28:51,952 --> 01:28:53,818
- Whoo, I don't smell anything.
- Smell anything.

1657
01:28:53,995 --> 01:28:55,577
We don't smell anything.

1658
01:28:55,664 --> 01:28:56,905
I told you I was on the brink...

1659
01:28:56,998 --> 01:28:58,205
- I don't smell anything.
- ...of no stink.

1660
01:28:58,291 --> 01:28:59,657
I don't smell anything.

1661
01:28:59,835 --> 01:29:01,167
- I don't smell...
- I don't smell anything!

1662
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:02,577
<i>Stanley doesn't smell anything!</i>

1663
01:29:02,712 --> 01:29:04,749
<i>- I don't smell anything!
- Oh, no!</i>

1664
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:09,750
Mm-mmm.

1665
01:29:09,928 --> 01:29:11,760
Rise and shine on you, man.

1666
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:14,013
Been farting all night. I can't sleep.

1667
01:29:16,101 --> 01:29:17,558
I think you overslept.

1668
01:29:20,897 --> 01:29:23,480
- How long have I been sleeping?
- A long time.

1669
01:29:26,736 --> 01:29:28,022
Stanley, I got to tell you something.

1670
01:29:28,196 --> 01:29:29,277
What?

1671
01:29:30,365 --> 01:29:32,402
It's my fault you were sent
to Camp Green Lake.

1672
01:29:32,659 --> 01:29:33,695
I stole the shoes.

1673
01:29:36,246 --> 01:29:38,329
I didn't know
they were Sweetfeet's.

1674
01:29:43,503 --> 01:29:45,460
<i>I mean, a lot of people donated, um,</i>

1675
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:48,418
<i>all their old stuff
to the homeless shelter.</i>

1676
01:29:48,925 --> 01:29:50,632
<i>And I saw the shoes and I just...</i>

1677
01:29:57,309 --> 01:29:58,390
I liked them.

1678
01:29:59,019 --> 01:30:00,351
I didn't know they were famous.

1679
01:30:03,481 --> 01:30:05,598
Next thing I know,
everyone's bugging out...

1680
01:30:05,692 --> 01:30:07,058
"The shoes are gone. The shoes are gone.

1681
01:30:07,235 --> 01:30:09,648
Where are the shoes?"

1682
01:30:10,739 --> 01:30:13,322
<i>Walking down the street,
I heard the sirens coming after me.</i>

1683
01:30:14,075 --> 01:30:15,316
I got scared.

1684
01:30:36,348 --> 01:30:38,010
I end up getting busted the next day,

1685
01:30:38,350 --> 01:30:40,387
lifting a pair of shoes from a Payless.

1686
01:30:43,313 --> 01:30:44,474
That's destiny.

1687
01:31:04,584 --> 01:31:05,665
Hey, yo, check it out.

1688
01:31:07,212 --> 01:31:09,249
Maybe they're coming for Caveman's body.

1689
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:14,166
Jaguar. That's a nice car.

1690
01:31:14,344 --> 01:31:16,006
Don't even think about it, Twitch.

1691
01:31:16,179 --> 01:31:17,636
Back up!
You can't keep him from me.

1692
01:31:17,806 --> 01:31:19,172
- Excuse me...
- I'm Stanley's attorney.

1693
01:31:19,265 --> 01:31:21,222
- I don't care if you are his attorney.
- You have no rights, okay?

1694
01:31:21,309 --> 01:31:22,845
- We have a right to protect our kids!
- That's it!

1695
01:31:22,936 --> 01:31:24,768
Come back here with a signed court order,
and then we'll talk.

1696
01:31:24,854 --> 01:31:26,686
What kind of operation is this?
What kind of malarkey is this?

1697
01:31:26,773 --> 01:31:28,981
I'm telling you, I'm not done with him.
I'll tell you that right now!

1698
01:31:29,067 --> 01:31:30,603
I'm not done with you. That's right.

1699
01:31:30,735 --> 01:31:31,771
Excuse me!

1700
01:31:43,623 --> 01:31:46,206
We ain't seen the last of her.
She'll be back.

1701
01:31:47,544 --> 01:31:49,251
And next time with a court order.

1702
01:31:50,005 --> 01:31:51,712
We'll just tell her the truth...

1703
01:31:53,049 --> 01:31:54,256
He ran away.

1704
01:31:55,301 --> 01:31:56,337
Right?

1705
01:31:56,511 --> 01:31:59,379
He ran away after he was told
he was gonna be released?

1706
01:31:59,556 --> 01:32:02,299
Been almost three days.
He's a goner for sure.

1707
01:32:02,851 --> 01:32:04,137
What are we gonna do?

1708
01:32:05,603 --> 01:32:07,139
You'll do as I say.

1709
01:32:13,069 --> 01:32:14,276
What did she say?

1710
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:16,646
Not much.

1711
01:32:19,075 --> 01:32:20,316
What'll we do?

1712
01:32:22,454 --> 01:32:23,786
You'll do as I say.

1713
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:29,791
But you didn't say anything either.

1714
01:32:36,426 --> 01:32:37,587
Hector...

1715
01:32:38,303 --> 01:32:40,636
I'm glad you stole those shoes
and threw them on my head.

1716
01:32:40,930 --> 01:32:42,046
What?

1717
01:32:43,808 --> 01:32:45,390
None of this would have happened.

1718
01:32:46,061 --> 01:32:48,144
When I first got sent
to Camp Green Lake...

1719
01:32:49,522 --> 01:32:51,058
I thought I got sent there

1720
01:32:51,232 --> 01:32:53,519
because of my... my... my family's curse.

1721
01:32:56,446 --> 01:32:58,278
But we're not even at camp anymore.

1722
01:32:58,948 --> 01:33:00,610
You know, we're... we're on God's Thumb.

1723
01:33:03,369 --> 01:33:05,076
I just have this weird feeling...

1724
01:33:07,373 --> 01:33:08,580
Everything's cool.

1725
01:33:10,668 --> 01:33:12,910
- Yeah. Same here.
- You got the same feeling?

1726
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:14,875
- Same feeling.
- It's a good one.

1727
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:18,792
You know, those stars look like
a shovel to me.

1728
01:33:22,097 --> 01:33:23,338
Exactly.

1729
01:33:27,435 --> 01:33:28,596
Hector...

1730
01:33:28,770 --> 01:33:29,851
What's up?

1731
01:33:31,356 --> 01:33:32,563
I feel lucky.

1732
01:33:36,736 --> 01:33:38,477
The onions have gone to your head.

1733
01:33:40,824 --> 01:33:42,861
What do you say we dig one more hole?

1734
01:34:09,644 --> 01:34:11,351
<i>It's so hot, Sam...</i>

1735
01:34:12,605 --> 01:34:14,221
<i>But I feel so cold.</i>

1736
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:23,230
Sam...

1737
01:34:23,408 --> 01:34:24,524
I can fix that.

1738
01:34:25,118 --> 01:34:26,108
Ah.

1739
01:34:29,164 --> 01:34:31,121
You got five seconds to tell me
where you buried your loot!

1740
01:34:36,754 --> 01:34:38,746
I've been waiting for you, Trout.

1741
01:34:41,551 --> 01:34:42,712
I ain't gonna kill you.

1742
01:34:45,805 --> 01:34:46,966
Go on.

1743
01:34:47,891 --> 01:34:48,972
Where's the loot?!

1744
01:34:49,142 --> 01:34:50,132
There ain't no loot.

1745
01:34:50,476 --> 01:34:51,683
Don't give me that.

1746
01:34:51,853 --> 01:34:53,970
You robbed every bank
from hell to Houston.

1747
01:34:54,147 --> 01:34:56,560
We saw you headin' back
with the shovel, Miss Katherine.

1748
01:34:56,733 --> 01:34:58,349
Linda Miller, is that you?

1749
01:34:58,526 --> 01:35:01,109
I've been Linda Walker
for the last 13 years.

1750
01:35:01,279 --> 01:35:02,315
- One...
- Aw, Linda...

1751
01:35:02,447 --> 01:35:04,109
You were such a good student.

1752
01:35:04,532 --> 01:35:06,114
You must have married him
for his money.

1753
01:35:06,284 --> 01:35:08,321
- Well, it's all gone now!
- Two!

1754
01:35:08,536 --> 01:35:10,027
It's dried up with the lake!

1755
01:35:10,872 --> 01:35:13,239
Hasn't rained here
since the day they killed Sam.

1756
01:35:13,416 --> 01:35:15,874
Now, you better tell him what he wants!
He's a desperate man!

1757
01:35:16,044 --> 01:35:17,910
- Three...
- Go on. Kill me.

1758
01:35:18,338 --> 01:35:20,204
The lake goes on for miles.

1759
01:35:21,090 --> 01:35:22,547
I ain't gonna kill you.

1760
01:35:22,675 --> 01:35:24,507
But by the time I'm finished with you,

1761
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:26,051
you gonna wish you was dead.

1762
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:32,133
I've been wishing I was dead
for a long time.

1763
01:35:34,687 --> 01:35:35,848
You...

1764
01:35:36,397 --> 01:35:38,559
Your children, and your
children's children...

1765
01:35:39,067 --> 01:35:41,559
will dig for the next 100 years,

1766
01:35:41,945 --> 01:35:44,187
and you will never find it.

1767
01:35:47,283 --> 01:35:48,990
Look out!

1768
01:35:50,828 --> 01:35:52,694
Come here, sweetheart.

1769
01:35:55,917 --> 01:35:57,658
Start digging, Trout.

1770
01:36:10,765 --> 01:36:11,801
Come on!

1771
01:36:23,987 --> 01:36:25,148
Ready?

1772
01:36:30,660 --> 01:36:31,867
You see right there?

1773
01:36:32,036 --> 01:36:33,026
- That's it?
- Yeah.

1774
01:36:33,204 --> 01:36:34,194
Book!

1775
01:36:44,966 --> 01:36:47,128
- Is this the hole?
- Yeah, this is it.

1776
01:36:47,302 --> 01:36:49,419
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm positive.

1777
01:36:49,637 --> 01:36:51,970
It's gonna take too long, man.
I got to go find another shovel.

1778
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:53,847
- All right. Be careful, though.
- All right.

1779
01:36:58,354 --> 01:37:00,141
Of course, she's gonna
make you pay for it...

1780
01:37:00,315 --> 01:37:01,977
It's your truck. Now you're accusing
me of doing something!

1781
01:37:02,150 --> 01:37:03,686
You think I did this to my own truck?

1782
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:06,898
You left the keys inside
of a truck in front of a...

1783
01:37:07,071 --> 01:37:10,405
This is a juvenile work camp
with juvenile delinquents.

1784
01:37:10,575 --> 01:37:12,817
Don't get me heated because I...
Don't insult me!

1785
01:37:12,994 --> 01:37:14,701
A truck with a tank full of gas?

1786
01:37:14,787 --> 01:37:17,074
I said, "get me a wrench."
Did I say, "get me a wrench"?

1787
01:37:17,165 --> 01:37:18,701
All right, fine, I'll get you a wrench.

1788
01:37:18,791 --> 01:37:21,158
Get me a wrench! You dumb...
Read my lips! Get me a wrench!

1789
01:37:21,336 --> 01:37:23,828
I'm gettin' it,
you sideburned Neanderthal!

1790
01:37:24,005 --> 01:37:25,667
I ain't here to be a mechanic!

1791
01:37:26,132 --> 01:37:28,374
Aah! Don't you throw nothing at me!

1792
01:37:36,309 --> 01:37:37,299
Whoa!

1793
01:37:37,477 --> 01:37:39,969
Man, you really been working.
Yeah.

1794
01:37:40,146 --> 01:37:41,603
- Coming down.
- Go.

1795
01:37:41,773 --> 01:37:43,435
How's it going?

1796
01:37:43,608 --> 01:37:46,476
Who knows? I could be digging up diamonds
and not see 'em.

1797
01:37:47,278 --> 01:37:50,771
I don't think Kissin' Kate Barlow
would have buried her treasure this deep.

1798
01:37:51,199 --> 01:37:53,407
Come on.
We got to make it wider.

1799
01:37:53,576 --> 01:37:54,862
How do we know one of her gang

1800
01:37:54,994 --> 01:37:56,610
didn't already come back
and dig up the treasure, man?

1801
01:37:56,704 --> 01:37:57,990
We don't.

1802
01:38:02,543 --> 01:38:03,704
Did you hear that?

1803
01:38:05,713 --> 01:38:06,874
What's this?

1804
01:38:13,262 --> 01:38:15,049
Watch out, watch out.

1805
01:38:16,015 --> 01:38:18,223
Hoo Hoo! We found it!

1806
01:38:18,351 --> 01:38:19,683
Come on, come on, come on!

1807
01:38:25,108 --> 01:38:26,269
This is it!

1808
01:38:26,442 --> 01:38:29,025
- What did I say?! What did I say?!
- Oh, man!

1809
01:38:30,613 --> 01:38:32,696
Thank you, boys.
You've been a big help.

1810
01:38:33,199 --> 01:38:34,815
MR.
- Oh, jeez!

1811
01:38:34,992 --> 01:38:36,654
Get back!

1812
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:39,077
Oh, my god.

1813
01:38:39,247 --> 01:38:41,284
O-o-oh ho. Ho ho.

1814
01:38:42,291 --> 01:38:44,533
Don't move.

1815
01:38:46,087 --> 01:38:48,079
Well, get in there, and pull it out.

1816
01:38:49,549 --> 01:38:50,790
You get in there.

1817
01:38:52,427 --> 01:38:54,259
Fine. I'll just wait.

1818
01:38:58,474 --> 01:38:59,885
Won't take long.

1819
01:39:00,601 --> 01:39:02,217
No, it won't take long.

1820
01:39:02,895 --> 01:39:04,056
Oh, my goodness!

1821
01:39:05,481 --> 01:39:07,518
Yeah, check it out.
Oh, my god.

1822
01:39:09,777 --> 01:39:10,813
Oh!

1823
01:39:11,112 --> 01:39:13,570
- Here we go.
- Hey, Stanley, guess what?

1824
01:39:13,739 --> 01:39:14,946
You're innocent.

1825
01:39:15,032 --> 01:39:17,445
Your lawyer came by yesterday to get you.

1826
01:39:17,535 --> 01:39:18,821
Too bad you weren't there.

1827
01:39:18,953 --> 01:39:20,740
Don't listen to him, Stanley.

1828
01:39:22,123 --> 01:39:23,955
Least now we'll have a body to give her.

1829
01:39:24,125 --> 01:39:25,957
What about Zero?

1830
01:39:27,545 --> 01:39:28,831
Zero was never here.

1831
01:39:29,005 --> 01:39:30,871
We got lots of holes to choose from.

1832
01:39:31,799 --> 01:39:34,166
Do you know how long
I've been waiting for this?

1833
01:39:34,427 --> 01:39:36,760
My granddaddy owned the whole lake,

1834
01:39:36,929 --> 01:39:38,170
then it dried up.

1835
01:39:38,598 --> 01:39:41,306
He drove himself crazy out here
digging holes.

1836
01:39:41,809 --> 01:39:43,345
Made me dig, too...

1837
01:39:43,519 --> 01:39:44,885
<i>Even on Christmas.</i>

1838
01:39:46,564 --> 01:39:49,307
All Righty. Today's the day.

1839
01:39:54,530 --> 01:39:56,146
I'm tired of this, grandpa.

1840
01:39:56,324 --> 01:39:57,940
That's too damn bad!

1841
01:39:58,117 --> 01:39:59,324
You keep digging!

1842
01:40:02,622 --> 01:40:04,204
Well, excuse me.

1843
01:40:04,749 --> 01:40:06,206
You'll thank me one day.

1844
01:40:19,347 --> 01:40:20,633
Maybe we should just shoot them.

1845
01:40:21,182 --> 01:40:22,673
The lizards or the kids?

1846
01:40:22,850 --> 01:40:24,386
You don't want to shoot
any of those lizards.

1847
01:40:24,477 --> 01:40:26,059
They'll start leaping all over the place.

1848
01:40:28,022 --> 01:40:30,730
I just want to know
why they haven't been bitten yet.

1849
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:32,357
Oh, crap.

1850
01:40:34,362 --> 01:40:36,649
Oh, for Pete's sake.
That can't be her already.

1851
01:40:36,822 --> 01:40:39,360
Well, it ain't the girl scouts
selling cookies.

1852
01:40:40,243 --> 01:40:42,610
All right, keep holding the boys
in the mess hall.

1853
01:40:42,703 --> 01:40:43,784
Tell them not to talk to anyone.

1854
01:40:43,955 --> 01:40:46,743
As long as they keep their mouths shut,
they won't have to dig any more holes.

1855
01:40:46,874 --> 01:40:49,742
But if they talk...
they'll be severely punished.

1856
01:40:49,961 --> 01:40:52,499
What should I tell them
we're gonna do to 'em if they do talk?

1857
01:40:53,548 --> 01:40:55,335
Use your imagination.

1858
01:40:56,509 --> 01:40:57,670
Go on!

1859
01:41:01,639 --> 01:41:02,629
Ugh!

1860
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:10,767
I just don't get it.

1861
01:41:10,940 --> 01:41:13,102
Nothing makes sense anymore around here.

1862
01:41:13,901 --> 01:41:15,392
- Stanley...
- What?

1863
01:41:15,820 --> 01:41:18,858
Is your last name your
first name spelled backwards?

1864
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:20,321
Yeah.

1865
01:41:22,702 --> 01:41:26,616
We wanted to call, but the phone lines
go down out here sometimes.

1866
01:41:26,789 --> 01:41:28,405
- Well, you could have tried harder.
- Watch your step here.

1867
01:41:28,541 --> 01:41:30,498
- You can always reach me.
- We did. We called several times.

1868
01:41:30,710 --> 01:41:32,952
Don't go no further! It's danger!

1869
01:41:33,129 --> 01:41:34,415
- Where's Stanley?
- I'll tell you.

1870
01:41:34,589 --> 01:41:36,455
He broke into my cabin about an hour ago.

1871
01:41:36,591 --> 01:41:38,548
I woke up and saw him running out
with my trunk.

1872
01:41:38,926 --> 01:41:40,042
They ran out here.

1873
01:41:40,177 --> 01:41:42,009
I don't know what the hell
they were thinking!

1874
01:41:42,179 --> 01:41:44,011
I witnessed it myself, counselor.

1875
01:41:44,181 --> 01:41:45,513
Don't go too close!

1876
01:41:45,683 --> 01:41:46,764
Oh, my god!

1877
01:41:47,435 --> 01:41:48,551
Don't move.

1878
01:41:48,728 --> 01:41:51,846
- How long have they been down there?
- Have you tried to get them out?

1879
01:41:52,064 --> 01:41:53,771
Well, just what do you suggest, counselor?

1880
01:41:53,941 --> 01:41:56,775
Well, this wouldn't have happened
if you had released him to me yesterday.

1881
01:41:56,944 --> 01:41:59,061
Excuse me. This wouldn't have
happened if he wasn't a thief.

1882
01:42:00,656 --> 01:42:01,772
What?

1883
01:42:02,366 --> 01:42:03,902
- A thief?
- That's right.

1884
01:42:04,994 --> 01:42:07,452
- Oh, back up. Those things'll bite.
- Oh!

1885
01:42:09,165 --> 01:42:10,406
That's a lie!

1886
01:42:11,167 --> 01:42:12,203
Stanley didn't steal anything!

1887
01:42:15,338 --> 01:42:16,454
Thank god.

1888
01:42:16,631 --> 01:42:18,793
- Thank god, you're okay!
- What are you doing?

1889
01:42:18,966 --> 01:42:20,173
It's Stanley's.
What are you doing? Let go!

1890
01:42:20,259 --> 01:42:21,545
Now, listen, you've been
caught red-handed.

1891
01:42:21,802 --> 01:42:24,670
I could send Stanley right back to prison
if I pressed charges.

1892
01:42:24,847 --> 01:42:27,260
However, in view of all the circumstances,
I think I'll just take...

1893
01:42:27,433 --> 01:42:28,423
It has his name on it!

1894
01:42:28,559 --> 01:42:29,549
What?

1895
01:42:29,644 --> 01:42:31,135
- No, it doesn't!
- Let go!

1896
01:42:31,937 --> 01:42:33,473
- Oh, my god.
- You see?

1897
01:42:33,648 --> 01:42:36,857
"Stanley Yelnats."

1898
01:42:37,485 --> 01:42:39,147
He... he can't read.

1899
01:42:39,737 --> 01:42:40,773
That's not possible.

1900
01:42:43,491 --> 01:42:46,108
Stanley, I'm taking you home.
Let's go.

1901
01:42:46,285 --> 01:42:48,447
Come on, Zero. We're getting out of here.

1902
01:42:48,704 --> 01:42:50,320
- What did you do?
- Come on.

1903
01:42:51,374 --> 01:42:53,081
Get your hands back.
Come on, get your hands off.

1904
01:42:53,167 --> 01:42:54,999
No, I have to look inside.
Get your hands off. Listen... don't.

1905
01:42:55,086 --> 01:42:56,577
This is mine, it was on my property,

1906
01:42:56,671 --> 01:42:58,037
- and you are a thief!
- It is not yours!

1907
01:42:58,130 --> 01:42:59,666
- My granddaddy...
- It has absolutely nothing to do...

1908
01:42:59,757 --> 01:43:01,043
- This is un-American.
- Stanley, come on.

1909
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:03,963
Put your things in the trunk.
Your parents are waiting. Let's go.

1910
01:43:07,556 --> 01:43:09,013
I can't leave without Hector.

1911
01:43:11,018 --> 01:43:12,259
I'll be okay.

1912
01:43:12,478 --> 01:43:16,188
Stanley, there is nothing that
I can do for your friend.

1913
01:43:16,357 --> 01:43:17,268
Don't worry...

1914
01:43:17,900 --> 01:43:19,687
We'll take good care of Hector.

1915
01:43:23,155 --> 01:43:24,566
I'm not leaving here without him.

1916
01:43:26,117 --> 01:43:26,857
Earl...

1917
01:43:27,034 --> 01:43:29,026
Would you please get me Hector's file?

1918
01:43:29,412 --> 01:43:31,529
Most certainly, Carla. Ms. Walker...

1919
01:43:32,748 --> 01:43:33,864
Well?

1920
01:43:35,501 --> 01:43:37,538
Get me the file of Hector Zeroni.

1921
01:43:40,965 --> 01:43:42,001
Well, just do it.

1922
01:43:46,637 --> 01:43:47,468
They're alive!

1923
01:43:47,888 --> 01:43:50,471
What are you gonna say?
Think of something.

1924
01:43:51,684 --> 01:43:53,141
- Caveman!
- Hey, Zero!

1925
01:43:53,310 --> 01:43:54,300
What's up, Zero?

1926
01:43:54,478 --> 01:43:55,468
What's up? What's up, man?

1927
01:43:55,646 --> 01:43:57,012
I can't believe you guys made it.

1928
01:43:57,189 --> 01:43:59,021
Oh, man! We thought you were buzzard food.

1929
01:43:59,191 --> 01:44:00,181
No, I'm not.
I'm going home.

1930
01:44:00,359 --> 01:44:02,521
- Going home?
- Man, you stink, dude.

1931
01:44:02,653 --> 01:44:03,643
What you been eating, man?

1932
01:44:03,863 --> 01:44:05,570
You smell like onions!

1933
01:44:07,742 --> 01:44:09,574
Whoo! Well, uh...

1934
01:44:11,537 --> 01:44:13,950
There seems to be no file of...

1935
01:44:14,248 --> 01:44:15,364
- Hector Zeroni.
- What?

1936
01:44:15,541 --> 01:44:16,577
Is that so?

1937
01:44:16,751 --> 01:44:18,743
What kind of a camp you running here?

1938
01:44:19,336 --> 01:44:20,417
A nice one.

1939
01:44:20,588 --> 01:44:22,250
If the state would give us some money,

1940
01:44:22,381 --> 01:44:24,247
then we'd have some decent filing.

1941
01:44:24,383 --> 01:44:27,171
I am ordering an investigation
of this facility.

1942
01:44:27,344 --> 01:44:29,427
Hey, lady, you got a pen
and paper I could borrow?

1943
01:44:29,597 --> 01:44:31,759
No, I don't.
But it looks like he does.

1944
01:44:31,932 --> 01:44:33,594
Yeah. You got a pen?

1945
01:44:33,768 --> 01:44:35,259
Yeah. Here.

1946
01:44:35,853 --> 01:44:36,809
Here's a pencil.

1947
01:44:37,229 --> 01:44:38,219
You got paper?

1948
01:44:39,690 --> 01:44:40,771
Um...

1949
01:44:41,275 --> 01:44:42,356
Here.

1950
01:44:43,569 --> 01:44:45,356
Here you go.

1951
01:44:45,446 --> 01:44:47,608
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1952
01:44:47,782 --> 01:44:49,023
Hey, call my Mom.

1953
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:50,190
What?

1954
01:44:50,367 --> 01:44:52,108
Tell her I said I was sorry.

1955
01:44:52,286 --> 01:44:54,949
Tell her,
"Theodore said he was sorry."

1956
01:44:56,665 --> 01:44:57,951
- I will, man.
- Thanks, man.

1957
01:44:58,125 --> 01:45:00,208
I will. I definitely will.

1958
01:45:00,377 --> 01:45:02,460
Marion Sevillo.

1959
01:45:02,630 --> 01:45:03,916
Oh, crap.

1960
01:45:04,089 --> 01:45:06,172
It's been a long time
since el Paso, Marion.

1961
01:45:08,135 --> 01:45:10,593
You're in violation of your parole,
carrying this weapon.

1962
01:45:10,763 --> 01:45:12,800
I had no knowledge of that.

1963
01:45:12,973 --> 01:45:16,387
Oh, yeah, just like you didn't know
Pendanski wasn't no doctor neither.

1964
01:45:18,479 --> 01:45:19,845
What?

1965
01:45:20,147 --> 01:45:21,854
Sit down, Marion.
You're under arrest again.

1966
01:45:22,024 --> 01:45:24,061
Marion? Tell ya, I didn't know
that was a man's name.

1967
01:45:26,445 --> 01:45:27,435
It ain't.

1968
01:45:27,613 --> 01:45:28,694
Ooh!

1969
01:45:29,573 --> 01:45:30,654
Okay...

1970
01:45:30,825 --> 01:45:32,817
This facility is now
under our jurisdiction.

1971
01:45:32,910 --> 01:45:33,946
- What?
- Boys...

1972
01:45:34,036 --> 01:45:35,527
Put these three bozos right over there,

1973
01:45:35,704 --> 01:45:38,071
let them see the other side
of the criminal justice system.

1974
01:45:38,165 --> 01:45:39,827
Excuse me?

1975
01:45:41,585 --> 01:45:43,042
Don't push me! I'm a lady!

1976
01:45:43,879 --> 01:45:46,166
Come on, Hector.
You're coming with us. Let's go.

1977
01:45:46,340 --> 01:45:47,421
Come on, boss.

1978
01:45:49,677 --> 01:45:50,667
What's that?

1979
01:45:56,725 --> 01:45:57,715
Oh!

1980
01:45:57,893 --> 01:45:58,883
Oh!

1981
01:45:59,061 --> 01:46:00,051
It's rain!

1982
01:46:00,229 --> 01:46:01,219
Ahh!

1983
01:46:17,705 --> 01:46:18,786
Whoo!

1984
01:46:44,732 --> 01:46:45,939
Hector!

1985
01:46:46,191 --> 01:46:47,181
Stanley!

1986
01:46:47,568 --> 01:46:48,684
Come on!

1987
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:51,061
You be careful out there
in the real world, a'ight?

1988
01:46:51,238 --> 01:46:53,571
- All right, boss.
- Everyone's not as friendly as us.

1989
01:46:53,741 --> 01:46:55,107
Hold on for me.

1990
01:46:55,576 --> 01:46:56,908
We'll miss you, man!

1991
01:46:57,578 --> 01:46:58,989
All right, guys. Be good!

1992
01:46:59,163 --> 01:47:01,200
- Keep your head up!
- We'll miss you!

1993
01:47:01,332 --> 01:47:02,664
All right! Stanley...

1994
01:47:03,042 --> 01:47:05,625
Stanley, won't you just open it?

1995
01:47:05,794 --> 01:47:08,081
Just let me see what's inside it, please.

1996
01:47:08,797 --> 01:47:09,878
Excuse me?

1997
01:47:16,847 --> 01:47:18,839
- Have a seat over here.
- "D" tent!

1998
01:47:19,058 --> 01:47:21,266
- See you again!
- I'll see you!

1999
01:47:21,435 --> 01:47:22,425
"D" tent!

2000
01:47:22,603 --> 01:47:23,719
You have the right to remain silent.

2001
01:47:23,896 --> 01:47:26,013
If you give up that right,
anything you say can,

2002
01:47:26,190 --> 01:47:28,102
and will, be used against you
in a court of law.

2003
01:47:28,275 --> 01:47:30,642
You have the right to be
represented by an attorney.

2004
01:47:30,736 --> 01:47:33,103
If you cannot afford one, the court...

2005
01:47:45,626 --> 01:47:47,788
Okay, one more thing,
no matter what is in this box...

2006
01:47:47,962 --> 01:47:49,828
- Mm-hmm.
- We are still family.

2007
01:47:50,005 --> 01:47:51,086
- We are the Yelnats.
- Okay.

2008
01:47:51,256 --> 01:47:52,246
We know.

2009
01:47:52,424 --> 01:47:53,881
- One...
- Cross your fingers.

2010
01:47:54,051 --> 01:47:55,041
- Two...
- Two...

2011
01:47:55,344 --> 01:47:57,131
- Three.
- Oh, my god, honey, you've still got it.

2012
01:47:57,221 --> 01:47:58,211
You are so strong.

2013
01:48:00,599 --> 01:48:01,965
Oh, my god!

2014
01:48:02,142 --> 01:48:03,883
- Yeah?
- Oh, mama.

2015
01:48:04,061 --> 01:48:05,051
Oh, boy.

2016
01:48:05,229 --> 01:48:06,811
Oh, my goodness.

2017
01:48:08,524 --> 01:48:09,731
Let me see that.

2018
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:11,482
- Sure.
- Look at this.

2019
01:48:12,403 --> 01:48:13,769
Okay, guys, hold on. Hold on.

2020
01:48:13,946 --> 01:48:16,313
Before we do anything,
I think that it's only fair

2021
01:48:16,490 --> 01:48:19,608
that half of whatever is in this box
goes to my best friend, Hector Zeroni.

2022
01:48:19,785 --> 01:48:21,617
Aw... You want to go halfsies? Well...

2023
01:48:21,870 --> 01:48:23,361
Did you say "Zeroni"?

2024
01:48:23,539 --> 01:48:24,529
Sure did.

2025
01:48:24,665 --> 01:48:26,531
Ha!

2026
01:48:28,085 --> 01:48:30,953
Oh, my god!
Is that really worth $25,000?

2027
01:48:31,130 --> 01:48:32,337
Hold on. Check the date, though.

2028
01:48:32,506 --> 01:48:33,997
AT&T.

2029
01:48:34,883 --> 01:48:36,124
1905.

2030
01:48:36,301 --> 01:48:37,837
What's it worth, honey?

2031
01:48:38,220 --> 01:48:39,756
It's worth a lot more now.

2032
01:48:39,972 --> 01:48:41,133
- Millions.
- Millions?

2033
01:48:41,932 --> 01:48:43,093
- Millions.
- Millions.

2034
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:46,263
- One for us...
- One for Mr. Zeroni.

2035
01:48:46,478 --> 01:48:47,889
One for us...

2036
01:48:48,063 --> 01:48:50,305
One for Mr. Zeroni.

2037
01:48:55,070 --> 01:48:56,186
Boys.

2038
01:49:00,409 --> 01:49:01,616
Do good, bro.

2039
01:49:08,792 --> 01:49:09,782
Right this way, ma'am.

2040
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:11,041
Thank you.

2041
01:49:23,348 --> 01:49:25,214
I love you.
I love you.

2042
01:49:26,852 --> 01:49:28,343
<i>So, Hector was able to hire</i>

2043
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:30,637
<i>his own team
of private investigators.</i>

2044
01:49:31,273 --> 01:49:33,856
<i>Turns out his Mom had been
looking for him, too.</i>

2045
01:49:36,570 --> 01:49:37,811
I love you.

2046
01:49:51,543 --> 01:49:54,160
<i>And that's how
the great-great grandson</i>

2047

<i>of Elya Yelnats</i>

2048

2049
01:49:59,301 --> 01:50:00,917
became next-door neighbors.

2050
01:50:04,765 --> 01:50:06,176
<i>Camp Green Lake was closed</i>

2051
01:50:06,308 --> 01:50:07,719

<i>They say Camp Green Lake

2054
01:50:12,439 --> 01:50:13,771
<i>as a girls' camp.</i>

2055
01:50:13,941 --> 01:50:16,354
<i>At least they won't have to worry about
lizards anymore.</i>

2056
01:50:16,527 --> 01:50:18,063
<i>Just as long as the girls eat
lots of onions.</i>

2057
01:50:18,237 --> 01:50:20,103
Come on, everybody! Out of the pool!

2058
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:22,442
It's showtime! Book it out!

2059
01:50:22,616 --> 01:50:24,073
Come on, boys! Hurry! Hurry! It's on!

2060
01:50:24,243 --> 01:50:25,450
It's on!

2061
01:50:26,036 --> 01:50:27,277
Come on!

2062
01:50:27,621 --> 01:50:29,453
Sit down, sit down. Oh, good.

2063
01:50:29,623 --> 01:50:31,831
