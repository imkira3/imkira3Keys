6
00:00:57,846 --> 00:01:00,222
Cursed pirates sail these waters.

7
00:01:00,306 --> 00:01:02,557
You don't want to bring
them down on us, do ya?

8
00:01:02,642 --> 00:01:04,435
Mr. Gibbs, that will do.

9
00:01:05,228 --> 00:01:07,105
She was singing about pirates!

10
00:01:07,147 --> 00:01:09,272
Bad luck to be singing about pirates

11
00:01:09,357 --> 00:01:12,527
with us mired in this unnatural fog,
mark my words.

12
00:01:12,611 --> 00:01:13,945
Consider them marked.

13
00:01:15,698 --> 00:01:18,115
- On your way.
- Aye, lieutenant.

14
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,284
It's bad luck to have
a woman on board too.

15
00:01:20,327 --> 00:01:22,577
Even a miniature one.

16
00:01:23,704 --> 00:01:26,164
I think it'd be rather exciting
to meet a pirate.

17
00:01:27,876 --> 00:01:29,961
Think again, Miss Swann.

18
00:01:30,045 --> 00:01:32,880
Vile and dissolute creatures,
the lot of 'em.

19
00:01:32,964 --> 00:01:36,092
I intend to see to it that any man
who sails under a pirate flag

20
00:01:36,134 --> 00:01:38,760
or wears a pirate brand
gets what he deserves.

21
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:42,140
A short drop and a sudden stop.

22
00:01:46,185 --> 00:01:48,812
Lieutenant Norrington,
I appreciate your fervor,

23
00:01:48,855 --> 00:01:53,484
but I'm concerned about the effect
this subject will have upon my daughter.

24
00:01:53,568 --> 00:01:55,360
My apologies, Governor Swann.

25
00:01:55,445 --> 00:01:57,655
Actually, I find it all fascinating.

26
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,488
Yes. That's what concerns me.

27
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:30,187
Look! A boy!
There's a boy in the water!

28
00:02:32,648 --> 00:02:34,608
Man overboard!

29
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,569
Man the ropes!
Fetch a hook!

30
00:02:38,404 --> 00:02:39,738
Haul him aboard!

31
00:02:48,288 --> 00:02:50,207
He's still breathing.

32
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,542
Mary, Mother of God!

33
00:02:59,008 --> 00:03:00,551
What happened here?

34
00:03:02,052 --> 00:03:05,763
Most likely the powder magazine.
Merchant vessels run heavily armed.

35
00:03:07,809 --> 00:03:09,390
Lot of good it did them.

36
00:03:09,475 --> 00:03:12,062
Everyone's thinking it,
I'm just saying it.

37
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,147
Pirates!

38
00:03:14,232 --> 00:03:17,067
There's no proof of that!

39
00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:18,650
It was probably an accident.

40
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,029
Rouse the captain.

41
00:03:22,072 --> 00:03:23,989
- Aye, sir.
- Heave to and take in sail.

42
00:03:24,074 --> 00:03:25,741
- Launch the boats.
- Heave to!

43
00:03:27,912 --> 00:03:30,247
Elizabeth, I want you
to accompany the boy.

44
00:03:31,414 --> 00:03:32,749
He'll be in your charge.

45
00:03:32,792 --> 00:03:34,459
Take care of him.

46
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,437
It's OK.

47
00:03:55,522 --> 00:03:58,274
My name's Elizabeth Swann.

48
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:01,027
Will Turner.

49
00:04:02,029 --> 00:04:03,947
I'm watching over you, Will.

50
00:04:16,752 --> 00:04:18,711
You're a pirate!

51
00:04:18,795 --> 00:04:20,714
Has he said anything?

52
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,382
His name's William Turner.

53
00:04:22,466 --> 00:04:23,966
That's all I found out.

54
00:04:24,968 --> 00:04:27,178
Take him below.

55
00:05:36,581 --> 00:05:38,374
Elizabeth!

56
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:41,377
Are you all right?

57
00:05:42,797 --> 00:05:43,921
Are you decent?

58
00:05:44,548 --> 00:05:45,548
Yes.

59
00:05:45,591 --> 00:05:46,590
Yes?

60
00:05:48,093 --> 00:05:49,552
Still in bed at this hour?

61
00:05:51,596 --> 00:05:53,889
It's a beautiful day.

62
00:05:55,391 --> 00:05:56,977
I have a gift for you.

63
00:05:59,938 --> 00:06:02,897
- Oh, it's beautiful!
- Isn't it?

64
00:06:04,568 --> 00:06:06,987
May I inquire as to the occasion?

65
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:10,488
Does a father need an occasion
to dote upon his daughter?

66
00:06:10,572 --> 00:06:12,616
Go on.

67
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,579
Actually, I...

68
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,875
I had hoped you might wear it
for the ceremony today.

69
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:23,210
Ceremony?

70
00:06:23,253 --> 00:06:25,671
Captain Norrington's promotion ceremony.

71
00:06:25,755 --> 00:06:26,922
I knew it!

72
00:06:27,007 --> 00:06:30,300
Commodore Norrington,
as he's about to become.

73
00:06:30,385 --> 00:06:32,302
A fine gentleman, don't you think?

74
00:06:33,096 --> 00:06:34,596
He fancies you, you know.

75
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,683
Elizabeth?

76
00:06:36,767 --> 00:06:38,434
How's it coming?

77
00:06:38,518 --> 00:06:41,103
It's difficult to say.

78
00:06:41,187 --> 00:06:43,439
I'm told it's
the latest fashion in London.

79
00:06:43,481 --> 00:06:44,856
Well, women in London

80
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,608
must've learned not to breathe!

81
00:06:48,778 --> 00:06:50,447
My Lord, you have a visitor.

82
00:07:08,757 --> 00:07:09,965
Ah, Mr. Turner.

83
00:07:10,008 --> 00:07:11,467
Good to see you again.

84
00:07:11,551 --> 00:07:13,385
Good day, sir.

85
00:07:14,303 --> 00:07:15,470
I have your order.

86
00:07:20,977 --> 00:07:22,144
Well...

87
00:07:22,228 --> 00:07:23,979
The blade is folded steel.

88
00:07:24,064 --> 00:07:27,065
That's gold filigree
laid into the handle.

89
00:07:27,776 --> 00:07:29,026
If I may?

90
00:07:31,196 --> 00:07:32,653
Perfectly balanced.

91
00:07:33,447 --> 00:07:35,741
The tang is nearly
the full width of the blade.

92
00:07:38,661 --> 00:07:40,829
Impressive. Very impressive.

93
00:07:40,872 --> 00:07:42,206
Very nice.

94
00:07:42,874 --> 00:07:45,875
Commodore Norrington's going
to be very pleased with this.

95
00:07:47,002 --> 00:07:49,505
Do pass my compliments
onto your master.

96
00:07:51,673 --> 00:07:52,673
I shall.

97
00:07:54,134 --> 00:07:57,471
A craftsman is always pleased
to hear his work is appreciated.

98
00:07:58,972 --> 00:08:02,475
Elizabeth!
You look absolutely stunning.

99
00:08:02,518 --> 00:08:04,352
Will.

100
00:08:04,686 --> 00:08:07,522
It's so good to see you.

101
00:08:07,606 --> 00:08:09,273
I had a dream about you last night.

102
00:08:09,358 --> 00:08:10,358
About me?

103
00:08:10,442 --> 00:08:12,111
Is it entirely proper for you...?

104
00:08:12,195 --> 00:08:13,986
About the day we met.
Do you remember?

105
00:08:14,029 --> 00:08:16,864
How could I forget, Miss Swann?

106
00:08:16,907 --> 00:08:19,409
How many times must I ask you
to call me Elizabeth?

107
00:08:19,494 --> 00:08:21,787
At least once more, Miss Swann.

108
00:08:21,871 --> 00:08:23,704
As always.

109
00:08:23,746 --> 00:08:25,040
Now, you see?

110
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,375
At least the boy
has a sense of propriety.

111
00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:28,710
We really must be going.

112
00:08:28,753 --> 00:08:29,753
Come on.

113
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:32,380
Good day, Mr. Turner.

114
00:08:33,965 --> 00:08:34,967
Come along!

115
00:08:38,346 --> 00:08:39,553
Good day...

116
00:08:42,391 --> 00:08:43,892
...Elizabeth.

117
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,275
Hold up there, you!

118
00:10:17,944 --> 00:10:21,279
It's a shilling to tie up
your boat to the dock.

119
00:10:23,282 --> 00:10:24,991
And I shall need to know your name.

120
00:10:27,663 --> 00:10:29,956
What do you say to three shillings,

121
00:10:29,998 --> 00:10:31,249
and we forget the name?

122
00:10:34,711 --> 00:10:36,920
Welcome to Port Royal, Mr. Smith.

123
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,208
Two paces... march!

124
00:11:17,753 --> 00:11:19,756
Right about... face!

125
00:11:22,301 --> 00:11:25,052
Present... arms!

126
00:11:49,327 --> 00:11:52,079
This dock is off-limits to civilians.

127
00:11:52,164 --> 00:11:53,913
I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know.

128
00:11:53,956 --> 00:11:56,667
If I see one,
I shall inform you immediately.

129
00:12:00,254 --> 00:12:03,881
Apparently, there's some high-toned
and fancy to-do up at the fort, eh?

130
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:07,094
How could it be two upstanding
gentlemen, such as yourselves,

131
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,138
did not merit an invitation?

132
00:12:09,222 --> 00:12:12,391
Someone has to make sure this dock
stays off-limits to civilians.

133
00:12:12,434 --> 00:12:14,811
It's a fine goal, to be sure.

134
00:12:14,894 --> 00:12:16,854
But it seems to me, a...

135
00:12:16,938 --> 00:12:18,688
A ship like that...

136
00:12:18,773 --> 00:12:21,776
...makes this one here
a bit superfluous, really.

137
00:12:21,818 --> 00:12:24,944
Oh, the Dauntless is the power
in these waters, true enough,

138
00:12:24,987 --> 00:12:28,948
but there's no ship that can match
the Interceptor for speed.

139
00:12:28,991 --> 00:12:30,075
I've heard of one.

140
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:32,786
It's supposed to be very fast,
nigh uncatchable.

141
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,622
The Black Pearl.

142
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:38,665
There's no real ship

143
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,419
that can match the Interceptor.

144
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:44,131
The Black Pearl is a real ship.

145
00:12:44,174 --> 00:12:45,799
No. No, it's not.

146
00:12:45,841 --> 00:12:47,175
Yes, it is. I've seen it!

147
00:12:47,926 --> 00:12:49,011
You've seen it?

148
00:12:49,096 --> 00:12:51,972
- Yes.
- You haven't seen it!

149
00:12:52,057 --> 00:12:54,764
- Yes, I have!
- You've seen a ship

150
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,812
with black sails,

151
00:12:56,896 --> 00:12:58,562
that's crewed by the damned,

152
00:12:58,647 --> 00:13:01,147
and captained by a man so evil

153
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,817
that hell itself spat him back out?

154
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:06,861
No.

155
00:13:07,613 --> 00:13:10,030
But I have seen a ship
with black sails.

156
00:13:10,115 --> 00:13:12,992
Oh... And no ship that's
not crewed by the damned,

157
00:13:13,077 --> 00:13:15,829
and captained by a man so evil
that hell spat him back out

158
00:13:15,871 --> 00:13:17,497
could possibly have black sails,

159
00:13:17,581 --> 00:13:19,833
therefore couldn't possibly
be any other ship

160
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:23,335
than the Black Pearl,
is that what you're saying?

161
00:13:23,378 --> 00:13:24,504
No.

162
00:13:24,547 --> 00:13:25,838
Like I said,

163
00:13:25,922 --> 00:13:29,134
there's no real ship
that can match the Interceptor...

164
00:13:31,596 --> 00:13:32,594
Hey!

165
00:13:34,058 --> 00:13:35,056
You!

166
00:13:35,558 --> 00:13:37,225
Get away from there!

167
00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:39,685
You don't have permission
to be aboard there!

168
00:13:39,727 --> 00:13:41,439
Sorry. It's such a pretty boat.

169
00:13:41,522 --> 00:13:42,521
Ship!

170
00:13:43,275 --> 00:13:44,274
What's your name?

171
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:45,357
Smith!

172
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,152
Or Smithy, if you like.

173
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:50,489
What's your purpose in Port Royal,
Mr. Smith?

174
00:13:50,532 --> 00:13:51,531
Yeah, and no lies!

175
00:13:51,615 --> 00:13:53,075
All right then.

176
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,159
I confess.

177
00:13:54,576 --> 00:13:57,871
It is my intention to commandeer
one of these ships, pick up a crew

178
00:13:57,954 --> 00:14:01,373
in Tortuga to rape, pillage, and pilfer
my weasely black guts out.

179
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,333
I said, no lies!

180
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:05,296
I think he's telling the truth.

181
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,921
If he were telling the truth,

182
00:14:07,006 --> 00:14:08,257
he wouldn't have told us.

183
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:12,760
Unless he knew you wouldn't believe
the truth, even if he told it to you.

184
00:14:23,481 --> 00:14:24,856
May I have a moment?

185
00:14:33,824 --> 00:14:35,574
You look lovely, Elizabeth.

186
00:14:35,617 --> 00:14:37,411
Yes.

187
00:14:38,496 --> 00:14:41,164
I apologize if I seem forward,

188
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:43,334
but I must speak my mind.

189
00:14:46,213 --> 00:14:49,214
This promotion throws into sharp relief

190
00:14:49,256 --> 00:14:52,215
that which I have not yet achieved.

191
00:14:54,677 --> 00:14:56,430
A marriage to a fine woman.

192
00:14:57,973 --> 00:15:00,642
You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth.

193
00:15:01,226 --> 00:15:02,602
I can't breathe.

194
00:15:02,686 --> 00:15:04,478
Yes, I...

195
00:15:04,562 --> 00:15:06,064
I'm a bit nervous myself.

196
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:10,651
And then they made me their chief.

197
00:15:13,614 --> 00:15:14,656
Elizabeth?

198
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:18,368
Elizabeth!

199
00:15:20,621 --> 00:15:23,330
The rocks!
Sir, it's a miracle she missed them!

200
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,128
- Will you be saving her, then?
- I can't swim!

201
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:32,297
Pearl of the King's Navy, you are!

202
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,050
Do not lose these!

203
00:15:48,523 --> 00:15:49,732
What was that?

204
00:16:24,392 --> 00:16:26,017
Make way!

205
00:16:32,566 --> 00:16:33,566
I got her!

206
00:16:34,945 --> 00:16:36,111
She's not breathing!

207
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:37,196
Move!

208
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,038
I never would've thought of that.

209
00:16:46,122 --> 00:16:48,372
Clearly you've never been to Singapore.

210
00:16:53,963 --> 00:16:55,590
Where did you get that?

211
00:16:57,801 --> 00:17:00,011
On your feet.

212
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:02,638
Elizabeth!

213
00:17:03,973 --> 00:17:05,973
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

214
00:17:10,938 --> 00:17:13,523
- Shoot him!
- Father! Commodore...

215
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:15,608
...do you intend to kill my rescuer?

216
00:17:22,992 --> 00:17:24,785
I believe thanks are in order.

217
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:32,250
Had a brush with the East India
Trading Company, did we?

218
00:17:32,293 --> 00:17:33,584
Pirate?

219
00:17:34,838 --> 00:17:36,129
Hang him.

220
00:17:36,214 --> 00:17:38,964
Keep your guns on him, men.
Gillette, fetch some irons.

221
00:17:40,218 --> 00:17:41,552
Well, well.

222
00:17:41,595 --> 00:17:44,096
Jack Sparrow, isn't it?

223
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,807
Captain Jack Sparrow,
if you please, sir.

224
00:17:46,891 --> 00:17:48,768
Well, I don't see your ship...

225
00:17:48,811 --> 00:17:49,976
...captain.

226
00:17:50,061 --> 00:17:52,437
I'm in the market, as it were.

227
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,481
He said he'd come to commandeer one.

228
00:17:54,564 --> 00:17:57,359
I told you he was telling the truth.
These are his, sir.

229
00:18:00,822 --> 00:18:03,949
No additional shots nor powder.

230
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:07,620
A compass that doesn't point north.

231
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,293
And I half expected it
to be made of wood.

232
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:20,716
You are, without doubt,
the worst pirate I've heard of.

233
00:18:21,718 --> 00:18:23,134
But you have heard of me.

234
00:18:26,096 --> 00:18:28,639
Commodore, I really must protest!

235
00:18:28,724 --> 00:18:30,307
Carefully, lieutenant.

236
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,643
Pirate or not, this man saved my life!

237
00:18:32,687 --> 00:18:36,190
One good deed is not enough to redeem
a man of a lifetime of wickedness!

238
00:18:36,275 --> 00:18:37,982
But it seems enough to condemn him.

239
00:18:38,066 --> 00:18:39,526
Indeed.

240
00:18:41,069 --> 00:18:42,779
Finally.

241
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:45,156
Wait, don't shoot!

242
00:18:45,198 --> 00:18:46,532
I knew you'd warm up to me.

243
00:18:46,616 --> 00:18:49,412
Commodore Norrington,
my effects, please.

244
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:51,163
And my hat.

245
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,122
Commodore.

246
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:59,004
- Elizabeth. It is Elizabeth, isn't it?
- It's Miss Swann.

247
00:18:59,046 --> 00:19:01,673
Miss Swann, if you'd be so kind.

248
00:19:01,716 --> 00:19:04,343
Come, dear, we don't have all day.

249
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:07,096
Now, if you'll be very kind.

250
00:19:24,113 --> 00:19:25,529
Easy on the goods, darling.

251
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,365
You're despicable.

252
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,494
Sticks and stones, love.

253
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,119
I saved your life, you save mine.

254
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:33,204
We're square.

255
00:19:34,207 --> 00:19:35,413
Gentlemen...

256
00:19:35,498 --> 00:19:36,958
...my lady...

257
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:40,377
...you will always remember this
as the day you almost caught...

258
00:19:40,462 --> 00:19:42,881
...Captain Jack Sparrow!

259
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,399
Whoa!

260
00:20:01,484 --> 00:20:02,942
Now, will you shoot him?

261
00:20:03,026 --> 00:20:04,694
Open fire!

262
00:20:06,446 --> 00:20:07,614
Ahh!

263
00:20:11,994 --> 00:20:13,410
Burn his heels!

264
00:20:22,336 --> 00:20:23,547
Take steady aim.

265
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:24,921
Fire!

266
00:20:28,844 --> 00:20:30,846
Take cover, men!

267
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,847
Gillette...

268
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:35,767
...Mr. Sparrow has a dawn
appointment with the gallows.

269
00:20:36,144 --> 00:20:38,143
I would hate for him to miss it.

270
00:20:42,148 --> 00:20:43,566
Search upstairs!

271
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,111
Look lively, men!

272
00:21:28,236 --> 00:21:29,612
Whoa!

273
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:21,497
Right where I left you.

274
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:29,880
Not where I left you.

275
00:22:40,474 --> 00:22:42,309
You're the one they're hunting.

276
00:22:43,311 --> 00:22:44,478
The pirate!

277
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:48,357
You seem somewhat familiar.
Have I threatened you before?

278
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,069
I make a point of avoiding
familiarity with pirates.

279
00:22:51,152 --> 00:22:52,193
Ah...

280
00:22:52,236 --> 00:22:54,904
It would be a shame to put
a black mark on your record.

281
00:22:54,989 --> 00:22:56,490
So if you'll excuse me...

282
00:22:59,995 --> 00:23:02,161
Do you think this wise, boy?

283
00:23:03,123 --> 00:23:06,290
Crossing blades with a pirate?

284
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:07,751
You threatened Miss Swann.

285
00:23:10,796 --> 00:23:12,131
Only a little.

286
00:23:25,729 --> 00:23:28,897
You know what you're doing,
I'll give you that. Excellent form.

287
00:23:29,773 --> 00:23:31,482
But how's your footwork?

288
00:23:31,567 --> 00:23:33,652
If I step here...

289
00:23:35,031 --> 00:23:36,447
Very good.

290
00:23:36,489 --> 00:23:38,574
And now I step again.

291
00:23:43,287 --> 00:23:44,621
Ta.

292
00:24:04,517 --> 00:24:06,184
That is a wonderful trick.

293
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:11,148
Except, once again,
you are between me and my way out.

294
00:24:11,232 --> 00:24:12,356
And now...

295
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:14,400
...you have no weapon.

296
00:24:36,757 --> 00:24:38,382
Who makes all these?

297
00:24:39,842 --> 00:24:41,179
I do.

298
00:24:41,222 --> 00:24:43,513
And I practice with them...

299
00:24:44,056 --> 00:24:45,182
...three hours a day.

300
00:24:47,016 --> 00:24:49,185
You need to find yourself a girl, mate.

301
00:24:55,858 --> 00:24:58,778
Or... perhaps the reason
you practice three hours a day

302
00:24:58,862 --> 00:25:00,697
is that you already found one,

303
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:04,368
and are otherwise incapable
of wooing said strumpet.

304
00:25:04,452 --> 00:25:06,870
You're not a eunuch, are you?

305
00:25:06,955 --> 00:25:09,915
I practice three hours a day
so that when I meet a pirate,

306
00:25:09,999 --> 00:25:11,374
I can kill him!

307
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:29,661
You cheated.

308
00:26:29,746 --> 00:26:30,994
Pirate.

309
00:26:34,584 --> 00:26:36,626
- Move away!
- No.

310
00:26:36,668 --> 00:26:38,044
Please move?

311
00:26:38,128 --> 00:26:39,129
No!

312
00:26:39,172 --> 00:26:41,965
I cannot just step aside
and let you escape.

313
00:26:44,509 --> 00:26:46,509
This shot is not meant for you.

314
00:26:56,856 --> 00:26:58,856
There he is! Over here!

315
00:27:00,858 --> 00:27:02,816
Excellent work, Mr. Brown.

316
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,697
You've assisted in the capture
of a dangerous fugitive.

317
00:27:06,782 --> 00:27:09,074
Just doing my civic duty, sir.

318
00:27:10,075 --> 00:27:12,662
I trust you will always remember
that this is the day

319
00:27:12,704 --> 00:27:16,165
Captain Jack Sparrow almost escaped.

320
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:17,958
Take him away.

321
00:27:22,255 --> 00:27:25,173
- Come here, boy!
- Smell it?

322
00:27:25,216 --> 00:27:28,552
- Come here, boy!
- You want a nice, juicy bone?

323
00:27:28,637 --> 00:27:30,763
- Hey!
- Come here, boy!

324
00:27:30,846 --> 00:27:33,348
- Come here, boy!
- You can keep doing that forever.

325
00:27:33,433 --> 00:27:35,642
The dog is never going to move.

326
00:27:35,685 --> 00:27:39,980
Well, excuse us if we haven't resigned
ourselves to the gallows just yet!

327
00:27:41,024 --> 00:27:42,441
Come on!

328
00:27:46,697 --> 00:27:47,988
There you go, miss.

329
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:50,825
It was a difficult day for you,
I'm sure.

330
00:27:50,867 --> 00:27:53,536
I suspected Commodore Norrington
would propose,

331
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:56,205
but I must admit,
I wasn't entirely prepared for it.

332
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:58,541
I meant you being
threatened by that pirate!

333
00:27:58,583 --> 00:27:59,833
Sounds terrifying!

334
00:28:00,584 --> 00:28:03,337
Oh... Yes, it was terrifying.

335
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:05,381
But... the Commodore proposed!

336
00:28:05,465 --> 00:28:07,048
Fancy that.

337
00:28:07,133 --> 00:28:08,717
Now that's a smart match, miss,

338
00:28:08,801 --> 00:28:10,927
if it's not too bold to say.

339
00:28:11,013 --> 00:28:12,388
It is a smart match.

340
00:28:13,556 --> 00:28:15,348
He's a fine man.

341
00:28:16,642 --> 00:28:19,146
He's what any woman
should dream of marrying.

342
00:28:20,229 --> 00:28:22,356
Well, that Will Turner,

343
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:24,566
he's a fine man too.

344
00:28:24,608 --> 00:28:26,402
That is too bold.

345
00:28:26,486 --> 00:28:28,571
Well, beggin' your pardon, miss.

346
00:28:28,613 --> 00:28:30,280
It was not my place.

347
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:22,332
Has my daughter given
you an answer yet?

348
00:29:22,416 --> 00:29:24,123
No, she hasn't.

349
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:26,503
Well, she has had a very trying day.

350
00:29:28,173 --> 00:29:30,339
Ghastly weather, don't you think?

351
00:29:30,423 --> 00:29:32,300
Bleak. Really bleak.

352
00:29:34,096 --> 00:29:35,095
What's that?

353
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,056
Cannon fire!

354
00:29:39,432 --> 00:29:41,309
Return fire!

355
00:29:41,352 --> 00:29:44,396
I know those guns!

356
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:51,361
It's the Pearl!

357
00:29:51,444 --> 00:29:53,155
Black Pearl?

358
00:29:55,657 --> 00:29:57,283
I've heard stories.

359
00:29:57,326 --> 00:30:01,328
She's been preying on ships and
settlements for near ten years.

360
00:30:01,413 --> 00:30:02,998
Never leaves any survivors.

361
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:04,499
No survivors.

362
00:30:04,542 --> 00:30:07,377
Then where do the stories
come from, I wonder?

363
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:18,432
Clear the dock!

364
00:30:31,985 --> 00:30:33,652
Mama!

365
00:30:40,244 --> 00:30:41,870
Hoist your oars!

366
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:49,127
Come on, you!

367
00:31:39,886 --> 00:31:41,721
Sight the muzzle flash.

368
00:31:41,764 --> 00:31:42,764
Aim for the flashes.

369
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:44,933
I need a full spread, fore and aft.

370
00:31:44,975 --> 00:31:46,642
Mr. Stevens, more cartridges!

371
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,647
Governor!
Barricade yourself in my office.

372
00:31:51,606 --> 00:31:52,606
Good God!

373
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:54,274
That's an order.

374
00:32:11,209 --> 00:32:13,503
Don't!

375
00:32:14,295 --> 00:32:15,462
Hello, chum.

376
00:32:19,718 --> 00:32:21,261
Up there! Go!

377
00:32:31,062 --> 00:32:33,690
Miss! They've come to kidnap you!

378
00:32:33,774 --> 00:32:36,316
- What?
- You're the governor's daughter!

379
00:32:36,401 --> 00:32:37,569
In here!

380
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:43,574
They haven't seen you. Hide, and the
first chance you get, run to the fort!

381
00:32:53,084 --> 00:32:54,710
Got ya! Haven't I?

382
00:32:58,214 --> 00:33:01,716
No! No! It's hot!

383
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,678
- I'm burning!
- Come on!

384
00:33:08,141 --> 00:33:09,474
Come on, me lads!

385
00:33:36,711 --> 00:33:38,670
Come out.

386
00:33:47,638 --> 00:33:50,473
We know you're here, poppet.

387
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:52,725
Poppet.

388
00:33:52,809 --> 00:33:53,852
Come out...

389
00:33:54,771 --> 00:33:56,981
...and we promise we won't hurt you.

390
00:33:57,066 --> 00:33:58,315
Eh?

391
00:34:00,067 --> 00:34:02,069
We will find you, poppet.

392
00:34:03,111 --> 00:34:05,530
You've got something of ours,

393
00:34:05,573 --> 00:34:07,365
and it calls to us.

394
00:34:13,081 --> 00:34:15,582
The gold calls to us.

395
00:34:16,625 --> 00:34:17,793
The gold.

396
00:34:23,925 --> 00:34:25,966
Hello, poppet.

397
00:34:26,511 --> 00:34:27,512
Parley!

398
00:34:28,221 --> 00:34:29,429
What?

399
00:34:29,471 --> 00:34:30,639
Parley.

400
00:34:30,723 --> 00:34:32,139
I invoke the right of parley.

401
00:34:32,224 --> 00:34:36,144
According to the code of Brethren, set
down by pirates Morgan and Bartholomew,

402
00:34:36,229 --> 00:34:39,314
- you have to take me to your captain.
- I know the code.

403
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:42,107
If an adversary demands parley,
you can do them no harm

404
00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:44,944
- until the parley is complete.
- To blazes with the code!

405
00:34:45,028 --> 00:34:46,987
She wants to be taken to the captain.

406
00:34:48,491 --> 00:34:50,784
And she'll go, without a fuss.

407
00:34:51,827 --> 00:34:54,869
We must honor the code.

408
00:35:05,508 --> 00:35:06,882
Say goodbye!

409
00:35:11,598 --> 00:35:12,847
Goodbye.

410
00:35:16,976 --> 00:35:18,771
- Come on!
- Elizabeth!

411
00:35:20,272 --> 00:35:21,399
Well!

412
00:35:28,197 --> 00:35:29,779
Out of my way, scum!

413
00:35:42,419 --> 00:35:45,336
My sympathies, friend.
You've no manner of luck at all.

414
00:36:07,904 --> 00:36:11,114
Come on, doggy!
It's just you and me now.

415
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:13,574
It's you and old Jack.
Come on.

416
00:36:13,658 --> 00:36:15,368
Come on. That's a boy!

417
00:36:15,411 --> 00:36:17,578
Good boy. Come get your bone!

418
00:36:17,662 --> 00:36:21,540
That's a good boy.
Come on, a bit closer, a bit closer.

419
00:36:21,625 --> 00:36:23,667
That's it! That's it, doggy!

420
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:27,130
Come on, you filthy,
slimy, mangy cur!

421
00:36:28,382 --> 00:36:30,049
Don't do that. No, no, no!

422
00:36:30,091 --> 00:36:31,759
I didn't mean it! I didn't...

423
00:36:38,642 --> 00:36:40,184
This ain't the armory!

424
00:36:41,895 --> 00:36:43,104
Well, well, well.

425
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:46,065
Look what we have here, Twigg.

426
00:36:46,149 --> 00:36:48,235
Captain Jack Sparrow.

427
00:36:49,402 --> 00:36:51,569
Last time I saw you,

428
00:36:51,612 --> 00:36:53,405
you were all alone

429
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:56,242
on a godforsaken island,

430
00:36:56,284 --> 00:36:58,495
shrinking into the distance.

431
00:36:58,579 --> 00:37:01,079
His fortunes aren't improved much.

432
00:37:01,163 --> 00:37:04,584
Worry about your own fortunes,
gentlemen.

433
00:37:04,627 --> 00:37:07,670
The deepest circle of hell
is reserved for betrayers

434
00:37:07,754 --> 00:37:09,296
and mutineers.

435
00:37:13,426 --> 00:37:14,927
So there is a curse.

436
00:37:16,637 --> 00:37:18,013
That's interesting.

437
00:37:18,099 --> 00:37:20,350
You know nothing of hell.

438
00:37:29,024 --> 00:37:31,025
That's very interesting.

439
00:38:06,479 --> 00:38:09,022
I didn't know we was takin' on captives.

440
00:38:09,107 --> 00:38:12,151
She's invoked the right of parley
with Captain Barbossa.

441
00:38:12,235 --> 00:38:16,070
- I am here to negotia...
- You will speak when spoken to!

442
00:38:17,073 --> 00:38:19,158
And ye will not lay a hand on those

443
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,618
under the protection of parley.

444
00:38:22,245 --> 00:38:23,412
Aye, sir.

445
00:38:26,124 --> 00:38:28,042
My apologies, miss.

446
00:38:29,127 --> 00:38:30,461
Captain Barbossa,

447
00:38:30,503 --> 00:38:34,924
I am here to negotiate the cessation
of hostilities against Port Royal.

448
00:38:36,009 --> 00:38:40,054
A lot of long words in there, miss.
We are naught but humble pirates.

449
00:38:41,139 --> 00:38:42,724
What is it that you want?

450
00:38:42,808 --> 00:38:45,100
I want you to leave
and never come back.

451
00:38:47,562 --> 00:38:50,189
I'm disinclined
to acquiesce to your request.

452
00:38:51,775 --> 00:38:54,108
Means "no."

453
00:38:55,528 --> 00:38:56,528
Very well.

454
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,116
I'll drop it.

455
00:39:05,163 --> 00:39:09,791
Me holds are burstin' with swag!
That bit of shine matters to us?

456
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:10,918
Why?

457
00:39:12,045 --> 00:39:14,338
It's what you've been searching for.

458
00:39:14,381 --> 00:39:16,047
I recognize the ship.

459
00:39:16,131 --> 00:39:19,008
I saw it eight years ago
on the crossing from England!

460
00:39:19,051 --> 00:39:20,220
Did you now?

461
00:39:23,222 --> 00:39:24,222
Fine.

462
00:39:25,224 --> 00:39:26,809
I suppose if it is worthless,

463
00:39:26,893 --> 00:39:28,727
then there's no point in me keeping it.

464
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:30,062
No!

465
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:43,074
You have a name, missy?

466
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,243
Elizabeth...

467
00:39:45,327 --> 00:39:46,661
...Turner.

468
00:39:47,788 --> 00:39:49,873
I'm a maid in the governor's household.

469
00:39:53,168 --> 00:39:54,586
Miss Turner!

470
00:39:55,797 --> 00:39:57,046
Turner!

471
00:39:57,089 --> 00:39:58,506
Bootstrap!

472
00:40:02,553 --> 00:40:05,221
And how does a maid come
to own a trinket such as that?

473
00:40:05,264 --> 00:40:07,849
Family heirloom, perhaps?

474
00:40:07,933 --> 00:40:10,436
I didn't steal it,
if that's what you mean.

475
00:40:12,022 --> 00:40:15,105
Very well. You hand it over,
we'll put your town to our rudder,

476
00:40:15,189 --> 00:40:16,399
and ne'er return.

477
00:40:30,122 --> 00:40:31,121
Our bargain?

478
00:40:34,126 --> 00:40:35,961
Still the guns and stow 'em.

479
00:40:36,004 --> 00:40:38,839
Signal the men, set the flags
and make good to clear port.

480
00:40:38,923 --> 00:40:40,631
Wait! You have to take me to shore.

481
00:40:40,674 --> 00:40:43,301
According to the code of
the order of the Brethren...

482
00:40:43,385 --> 00:40:47,055
Your return to shore was not part
of our negotiations nor our agreements,

483
00:40:47,139 --> 00:40:48,307
so I must do nothin'.

484
00:40:48,391 --> 00:40:51,477
Secondly, you must be a pirate
for the pirate's code to apply,

485
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:53,144
and you're not, and thirdly...

486
00:40:53,187 --> 00:40:55,939
...the code is more of what
you'd call a guideline,

487
00:40:55,982 --> 00:40:57,482
instead of actual rules.

488
00:40:57,524 --> 00:40:59,941
Welcome aboard the Black Pearl,

489
00:40:59,984 --> 00:41:01,486
Miss Turner.

490
00:41:22,173 --> 00:41:24,591
They've taken her!
They've taken Elizabeth!

491
00:41:24,675 --> 00:41:26,763
Mr. Murtogg, remove this man.

492
00:41:27,846 --> 00:41:29,931
We have to hunt them down!
We must save her!

493
00:41:30,015 --> 00:41:32,056
And where do you propose we start?

494
00:41:33,311 --> 00:41:36,978
If you have any information concerning
my daughter, please share it.

495
00:41:39,274 --> 00:41:41,025
That Jack Sparrow!

496
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:43,362
He talked about the Black Pearl.

497
00:41:43,404 --> 00:41:45,321
Mentioned it is more what he did.

498
00:41:46,906 --> 00:41:50,034
Ask him where it is! Make a deal
with him, he could lead us to it.

499
00:41:50,077 --> 00:41:51,577
No.

500
00:41:51,662 --> 00:41:54,956
The pirates who invaded this fort
left Sparrow locked in his cell,

501
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,041
ergo they are not his allies.

502
00:41:58,084 --> 00:42:01,087
Governor, we will establish
their most likely course...

503
00:42:01,171 --> 00:42:03,047
That's not good enough!

504
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:05,049
Mr. Turner...

505
00:42:05,092 --> 00:42:08,636
...you are not a military man,
you are not a sailor.

506
00:42:09,678 --> 00:42:11,056
You are a blacksmith.

507
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:13,933
And this is not the moment
for rash actions!

508
00:42:16,228 --> 00:42:19,229
Do not make the mistake of thinking
you are the only man here

509
00:42:19,313 --> 00:42:20,816
who cares for Elizabeth.

510
00:42:26,822 --> 00:42:28,572
Please...

511
00:42:32,952 --> 00:42:34,162
You! Sparrow!

512
00:42:34,246 --> 00:42:35,246
Aye?

513
00:42:35,289 --> 00:42:37,914
You are familiar with that ship,
the Black Pearl?

514
00:42:37,957 --> 00:42:39,332
I've heard of it.

515
00:42:39,417 --> 00:42:42,086
Where does it make berth?

516
00:42:43,088 --> 00:42:45,046
Have you not heard the stories?

517
00:42:46,757 --> 00:42:48,718
Captain Barbossa

518
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,511
and his crew of miscreants

519
00:42:50,596 --> 00:42:53,181
sail from the dreaded Isla de Muerte.

520
00:42:53,265 --> 00:42:56,059
It's an island that
cannot be found, except

521
00:42:56,102 --> 00:42:59,186
by those who already know where it is.

522
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:00,937
The ship's real enough,

523
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:04,441
therefore its anchorage must be
a real place. Where is it?

524
00:43:05,444 --> 00:43:06,611
Why ask me?

525
00:43:07,279 --> 00:43:08,863
Because you're a pirate.

526
00:43:08,946 --> 00:43:11,616
And you want to turn
pirate yourself. ls that it?

527
00:43:12,867 --> 00:43:13,868
Never!

528
00:43:17,621 --> 00:43:19,290
They took Miss Swann.

529
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:21,167
Oh. So it is that you found a girl!

530
00:43:21,251 --> 00:43:23,043
I see.

531
00:43:23,127 --> 00:43:25,881
If you're intending to brave all,
hasten to her rescue,

532
00:43:25,965 --> 00:43:27,924
and so win fair lady's heart...

533
00:43:27,966 --> 00:43:30,593
...you'll have to do it alone, mate.

534
00:43:30,636 --> 00:43:32,719
I see no profit in it for me.

535
00:43:33,804 --> 00:43:35,056
I can get you out of here.

536
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:36,806
How's that? The key's run off.

537
00:43:36,849 --> 00:43:38,475
I helped build these cells.

538
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:41,312
These are half-pin barrel hinges.

539
00:43:42,606 --> 00:43:45,899
With the right leverage,
and the proper application of strength,

540
00:43:47,026 --> 00:43:48,444
the door will lift free.

541
00:43:50,822 --> 00:43:52,072
What's your name?

542
00:43:52,156 --> 00:43:54,074
Will Turner.

543
00:43:55,368 --> 00:43:57,703
That would be short for William,
I imagine.

544
00:43:57,788 --> 00:43:58,954
Good, strong name.

545
00:43:59,956 --> 00:44:01,872
No doubt named for your father?

546
00:44:03,503 --> 00:44:04,584
Yes.

547
00:44:04,669 --> 00:44:06,586
Uh-huh.

548
00:44:07,463 --> 00:44:08,797
Well, Mr. Turner,

549
00:44:08,838 --> 00:44:10,048
I've changed me mind.

550
00:44:10,717 --> 00:44:13,718
If you spring me from this cell,
I swear, on pain of death,

551
00:44:13,803 --> 00:44:16,012
I shall take you to the Black Pearl,

552
00:44:16,055 --> 00:44:17,722
and your bonny lass.

553
00:44:17,808 --> 00:44:19,809
Do we have an accord?

554
00:44:23,312 --> 00:44:25,146
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

555
00:44:25,189 --> 00:44:26,356
Get me out.

556
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:33,655
- Hurry! Someone will have heard that.
- Not without my effects.

557
00:44:40,246 --> 00:44:41,746
We're going to steal the ship?

558
00:44:43,541 --> 00:44:44,541
That ship?

559
00:44:44,625 --> 00:44:46,457
Commandeer.

560
00:44:46,542 --> 00:44:48,795
We're going to commandeer that ship.

561
00:44:48,879 --> 00:44:49,964
Nautical term.

562
00:44:50,633 --> 00:44:52,716
One question about your business, boy,

563
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,217
or there's no use going.

564
00:44:54,302 --> 00:44:55,801
This girl...

565
00:44:55,885 --> 00:44:58,595
...how far are you willing to go
to save her?

566
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,016
I'd die for her.

567
00:45:00,058 --> 00:45:01,265
Oh, good.

568
00:45:01,349 --> 00:45:03,351
No worries then.

569
00:45:22,372 --> 00:45:24,914
This is either madness or brilliance.

570
00:45:25,709 --> 00:45:29,336
It's remarkable how often
those two traits coincide.

571
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:02,786
Everyone stay calm!
We're taking over the ship.

572
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:04,579
Aye! Avast!

573
00:46:07,792 --> 00:46:10,126
This ship cannot be crewed by two men.

574
00:46:11,003 --> 00:46:12,798
You'll never make it out of the bay.

575
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:14,464
Son...

576
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:18,342
...I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

577
00:46:18,426 --> 00:46:19,970
Savvy?

578
00:46:23,473 --> 00:46:24,473
Commodore!

579
00:46:24,516 --> 00:46:27,142
- Sir!
- They're taking the Dauntless!

580
00:46:28,814 --> 00:46:29,896
Commodore!

581
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:32,315
They're taking the ship!

582
00:46:33,067 --> 00:46:35,652
Sparrow and Turner!
They're taking the Dauntless!

583
00:46:35,694 --> 00:46:37,152
Rash, Turner.

584
00:46:37,237 --> 00:46:38,821
Too rash.

585
00:46:40,365 --> 00:46:44,578
That is, without doubt,
the worst pirate I have ever seen.

586
00:46:47,874 --> 00:46:49,165
Here they come.

587
00:46:54,004 --> 00:46:56,255
Bring her around!
Bring her around!

588
00:47:02,804 --> 00:47:05,974
Search every cabin, every hold,
down to the bilges.

589
00:47:19,113 --> 00:47:21,906
Check the aft!

590
00:47:21,991 --> 00:47:24,366
Sailors, back to the Interceptor!
Now!

591
00:47:24,409 --> 00:47:25,785
Quickly, men

592
00:47:27,163 --> 00:47:28,454
Whoa!

593
00:47:30,873 --> 00:47:34,795
Thank you, commodore,
for getting us ready to make way.

594
00:47:34,879 --> 00:47:37,463
We'd have had a hard time
of it by ourselves.

595
00:47:40,718 --> 00:47:42,759
Set topsails and clear up this mess.

596
00:47:42,844 --> 00:47:45,387
With the wind a quarter astern,
we won't catch them!

597
00:47:45,472 --> 00:47:48,391
I don't need to. Just get them
in range of the long nines.

598
00:47:48,476 --> 00:47:50,559
Hands, come about! Run out the guns!

599
00:47:50,602 --> 00:47:51,978
Bring out the guns!

600
00:47:52,062 --> 00:47:54,647
We are to fire on our own ship, sir?

601
00:47:54,731 --> 00:47:58,567
I'd rather see her at the bottom of the
ocean than in the hands of a pirate.

602
00:47:59,861 --> 00:48:03,197
Commodore! He's disabled
the rudder chain, sir.

603
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:08,911
Abandon ship!

604
00:48:12,749 --> 00:48:15,166
Let go the gear
and sheet home.

605
00:48:15,251 --> 00:48:17,711
That's got to be the best pirate
I've ever seen.

606
00:48:18,923 --> 00:48:21,549
So it would seem.

607
00:48:30,016 --> 00:48:32,099
When I was a lad,
living in England,

608
00:48:32,184 --> 00:48:34,061
my mother raised me by herself.

609
00:48:34,146 --> 00:48:36,104
After she died, I came out here,

610
00:48:36,189 --> 00:48:38,023
looking for my father.

611
00:48:39,483 --> 00:48:40,609
Is that so?

612
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:43,362
My father,

613
00:48:43,446 --> 00:48:44,821
Bill Turner?

614
00:48:44,906 --> 00:48:48,493
At the jail, it was only after you
learned my name that you agreed to help.

615
00:48:48,577 --> 00:48:51,286
Since that's what I wanted,
I didn't press the matter.

616
00:48:51,329 --> 00:48:52,912
I'm not a simpleton, Jack.

617
00:48:52,955 --> 00:48:54,956
You knew my father.

618
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:02,171
I knew him.

619
00:49:02,256 --> 00:49:05,175
Probably one of the few
who knew him as William Turner.

620
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:08,679
Everyone else just called him
"Bootstrap," or "Bootstrap Bill."

621
00:49:08,762 --> 00:49:09,762
Bootstrap?

622
00:49:10,766 --> 00:49:13,183
Good man.
Good pirate.

623
00:49:13,268 --> 00:49:15,353
I swear, you look just like him.

624
00:49:15,437 --> 00:49:16,478
It's not true.

625
00:49:16,521 --> 00:49:18,314
He was a merchant sailor.

626
00:49:18,399 --> 00:49:20,649
A good, respectable man
who obeyed the law.

627
00:49:20,733 --> 00:49:22,900
He was a bloody pirate, a scallywag.

628
00:49:24,278 --> 00:49:26,989
My father was not a pirate!

629
00:49:28,157 --> 00:49:30,157
Put it away, son.

630
00:49:30,242 --> 00:49:32,159
It's not worth you getting beat again.

631
00:49:32,244 --> 00:49:33,371
You didn't beat me.

632
00:49:33,455 --> 00:49:36,790
You ignored the rules of engagement.
In a fair fight, I'd kill you.

633
00:49:36,832 --> 00:49:39,667
That's not much incentive
for me to fight fair, is it?

634
00:49:47,009 --> 00:49:50,263
Now as long as you're just
hanging there, pay attention.

635
00:49:50,347 --> 00:49:52,848
The only rules
that really matter are these:

636
00:49:52,933 --> 00:49:56,810
What a man can do,
and what a man can't do.

637
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,687
For instance,

638
00:49:58,771 --> 00:50:01,897
you can accept that your father
was a pirate and a good man,

639
00:50:01,982 --> 00:50:03,025
or you can't.

640
00:50:03,067 --> 00:50:06,612
Pirate is in your blood, boy, so
you'll have to square with that someday.

641
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:09,655
Now, me, for example.
I could let you drown,

642
00:50:09,698 --> 00:50:14,201
but I can't bring this ship into Tortuga
all by me onesies. Savvy?

643
00:50:14,536 --> 00:50:15,537
So...

644
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:23,919
Can you sail under
the command of a pirate?

645
00:50:25,174 --> 00:50:26,505
Or can you not?

646
00:50:29,217 --> 00:50:30,259
Tortuga?

647
00:50:30,345 --> 00:50:32,094
Tortuga.

648
00:50:54,158 --> 00:50:56,578
More importantly, it is indeed

649
00:50:56,621 --> 00:50:58,497
a sad life that has never
breathed deep

650
00:50:58,581 --> 00:51:01,748
the sweet, proliferous bouquet
that is Tortuga. Savvy?

651
00:51:03,503 --> 00:51:04,627
What do you think?

652
00:51:08,924 --> 00:51:10,008
It'll linger.

653
00:51:10,093 --> 00:51:14,095
I'll tell you, mate, if every town
in the world were like this one,

654
00:51:14,179 --> 00:51:16,639
no man would ever feel unwanted.

655
00:51:18,601 --> 00:51:19,685
Scarlett!

656
00:51:21,604 --> 00:51:22,937
Not sure I deserved that.

657
00:51:24,731 --> 00:51:25,899
Giselle!

658
00:51:25,942 --> 00:51:26,940
Who was she?

659
00:51:27,024 --> 00:51:28,026
What?

660
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,612
I may have deserved that.

661
00:51:33,866 --> 00:51:36,992
Curse you for breathing,
you slack-jawed idiot!

662
00:51:39,328 --> 00:51:41,455
Mother's love!

663
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:42,540
Jack!

664
00:51:43,542 --> 00:51:46,670
You should know better than to
wake a man when he's sleepin'.

665
00:51:46,754 --> 00:51:50,632
- It's bad luck.
- Fortunately, I know how to counter it.

666
00:51:50,717 --> 00:51:54,009
The man who did the waking buys
the man who was sleeping a drink,

667
00:51:54,094 --> 00:51:57,513
and the man who was sleeping drinks
it while listening to a proposition

668
00:51:57,597 --> 00:51:59,306
from the man who did the waking.

669
00:52:01,475 --> 00:52:03,311
Aye, that'll about do it.

670
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:10,402
Blast! I'm already awake!

671
00:52:10,486 --> 00:52:11,861
That was for the smell.

672
00:52:15,157 --> 00:52:16,156
Eh...

673
00:52:22,331 --> 00:52:23,830
Keep a sharp eye.

674
00:52:30,963 --> 00:52:32,047
Now...

675
00:52:32,132 --> 00:52:34,593
...what's the nature
of this venture of your'n?

676
00:52:36,427 --> 00:52:40,849
I'm going after the Black Pearl.

677
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:43,851
I know where it's going to be,

678
00:52:43,895 --> 00:52:45,685
and I'm gonna take it.

679
00:52:46,729 --> 00:52:47,731
Jack,

680
00:52:47,815 --> 00:52:50,107
it's a fool's errand!

681
00:52:50,192 --> 00:52:53,528
Well, you know better than me
the tales of the Black Pearl!

682
00:52:53,571 --> 00:52:56,113
That's why I know
what Barbossa is up to.

683
00:52:56,699 --> 00:52:58,032
All I need is a crew.

684
00:52:58,742 --> 00:53:00,742
What I hear tell of Captain Barbossa,

685
00:53:00,826 --> 00:53:03,829
he's not a man to suffer fools,
nor strike a bargain with one!

686
00:53:03,872 --> 00:53:06,080
I'd say it's a good thing
I'm not a fool then.

687
00:53:06,166 --> 00:53:07,291
Prove me wrong!

688
00:53:07,957 --> 00:53:11,296
What makes you think Barbossa
will give up his ship to you?

689
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:14,715
Let's just say
it's a matter of leverage, eh?

690
00:53:18,094 --> 00:53:19,386
Hm?

691
00:53:21,556 --> 00:53:22,598
Mm.

692
00:53:22,682 --> 00:53:24,057
Huh?

693
00:53:24,099 --> 00:53:25,226
Hm...

694
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:26,310
Mm-hm-hm.

695
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:31,941
The kid?

696
00:53:33,527 --> 00:53:36,529
That is the child
of Bootstrap Bill Turner.

697
00:53:37,614 --> 00:53:40,075
His only child. Savvy?

698
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:42,076
Is he now?

699
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:47,415
Leverage, says you.

700
00:53:47,499 --> 00:53:50,084
I think I feel
a change in the wind, says I.

701
00:53:50,167 --> 00:53:51,919
- Mm.
- I'll find us a crew.

702
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:54,879
There's bound to be some sailors
on this rock, crazy as you.

703
00:53:54,923 --> 00:53:57,299
One can only hope.

704
00:53:57,384 --> 00:54:00,133
- Take what you can!
- Give nothin' back!

705
00:54:24,994 --> 00:54:26,787
You'll be dining with the captain,

706
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:29,206
and he requests you wear this.

707
00:54:30,165 --> 00:54:33,752
Tell the captain I'm "disinclined
to acquiesce to his request."

708
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:37,172
He said you'd say that.

709
00:54:37,257 --> 00:54:39,633
He also said, if that be the case...

710
00:54:39,718 --> 00:54:41,467
...you'll be dining with the crew,

711
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:43,345
and you'll be naked.

712
00:54:49,769 --> 00:54:50,894
Fine.

713
00:55:07,536 --> 00:55:11,124
There's no need to stand on ceremony
no call to impress anyone.

714
00:55:11,167 --> 00:55:13,542
You must be hungry.

715
00:55:30,976 --> 00:55:32,184
Try the wine.

716
00:55:37,024 --> 00:55:40,026
And the apples. One of those next.

717
00:55:48,327 --> 00:55:49,994
It's poisoned.

718
00:55:51,538 --> 00:55:53,873
There would be no sense
to be killing you.

719
00:55:53,916 --> 00:55:57,376
Then release me. You have your trinket.
I'm of no further value to you.

720
00:56:01,383 --> 00:56:03,424
You don't know what this is,

721
00:56:03,509 --> 00:56:04,885
do you?

722
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:07,219
It's a pirate medallion.

723
00:56:07,261 --> 00:56:09,346
This is Aztec gold.

724
00:56:10,224 --> 00:56:13,016
One of 882 identical pieces

725
00:56:13,059 --> 00:56:16,646
they delivered in a stone chest
to Cortés himself.

726
00:56:17,732 --> 00:56:21,943
Blood money paid to stem the slaughter
he wreaked upon them with his armies.

727
00:56:22,027 --> 00:56:25,863
But the greed of Cortés was insatiable.

728
00:56:25,906 --> 00:56:29,407
So the heathen gods
placed upon the gold...

729
00:56:31,287 --> 00:56:32,913
...a terrible curse.

730
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:38,792
Any mortal that removes but
a single piece from that stone chest...

731
00:56:39,795 --> 00:56:42,254
...shall be punished for eternity.

732
00:56:44,549 --> 00:56:47,927
I hardly believe in ghost stories
any more, Captain Barbossa.

733
00:56:48,012 --> 00:56:49,263
Aye.

734
00:56:50,056 --> 00:56:53,599
That's exactly what I thought
when we were first told the tale.

735
00:56:53,642 --> 00:56:56,561
Buried on an Isle of the Dead
what cannot be found,

736
00:56:56,603 --> 00:56:58,480
except for those who know where it is.

737
00:57:00,189 --> 00:57:01,523
Find it, we did.

738
00:57:03,193 --> 00:57:04,526
There be the chest.

739
00:57:04,610 --> 00:57:06,405
Inside be the gold.

740
00:57:07,363 --> 00:57:09,781
And we took 'em all!

741
00:57:09,825 --> 00:57:11,826
We spent 'em and traded 'em,

742
00:57:11,910 --> 00:57:13,578
and frittered 'em away

743
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:16,371
on drink and food
and pleasurable company.

744
00:57:16,455 --> 00:57:18,458
The more we gave 'em away,

745
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:21,169
the more we came to realize...

746
00:57:22,463 --> 00:57:24,630
...the drink would not satisfy.

747
00:57:25,883 --> 00:57:28,634
Food turned to ash in our mouths...

748
00:57:29,302 --> 00:57:31,887
...and all the pleasurable company
in the world

749
00:57:31,971 --> 00:57:33,973
could not slake our lust.

750
00:57:35,851 --> 00:57:38,644
We are cursed men, Miss Turner.

751
00:57:40,398 --> 00:57:43,067
Compelled by greed we were, but now...

752
00:57:43,151 --> 00:57:46,485
...we are consumed by it.

753
00:57:57,664 --> 00:58:00,582
There is one way we can end our curse.

754
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:07,631
All the scattered pieces
of the Aztec gold

755
00:58:07,673 --> 00:58:09,091
must be restored,

756
00:58:09,175 --> 00:58:11,594
and the blood repaid.

757
00:58:14,348 --> 00:58:15,723
Thanks to ye,

758
00:58:15,808 --> 00:58:17,935
we have the final piece.

759
00:58:19,978 --> 00:58:22,270
And the... blood to be repaid?

760
00:58:22,355 --> 00:58:24,857
That's why there's no sense
to be killing ya.

761
00:58:25,651 --> 00:58:26,650
Yet.

762
00:58:28,694 --> 00:58:30,196
Apple?

763
00:58:32,742 --> 00:58:35,201
Ha-ha. Hah!

764
00:58:35,244 --> 00:58:38,161
Arrgh!

765
00:58:38,204 --> 00:58:39,747
No!

766
00:58:47,047 --> 00:58:48,047
I'm curious.

767
00:58:48,132 --> 00:58:51,049
After killing me, what is it
you're planning on doing next?

768
00:59:54,615 --> 00:59:56,824
Look!

769
00:59:56,909 --> 00:59:59,827
The moonlight shows us
for what we really are.

770
01:00:00,619 --> 01:00:03,873
We are not among the living
and so we cannot die.

771
01:00:03,957 --> 01:00:05,623
But neither are we dead.

772
01:00:06,876 --> 01:00:10,671
For too long I've been parched of thirst
and unable to quench it.

773
01:00:10,756 --> 01:00:13,131
Too long I've been starvin' to death,

774
01:00:13,216 --> 01:00:14,841
and haven't died!

775
01:00:15,467 --> 01:00:17,261
I feel nothing.

776
01:00:18,054 --> 01:00:20,972
Not the wind on my face,
nor the spray of the sea...

777
01:00:22,391 --> 01:00:24,558
...nor the warmth of a woman's flesh.

778
01:00:25,561 --> 01:00:30,066
You best start believing
in ghost stories, Miss Turner.

779
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:31,148
You're in one!

780
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:52,170
What are you looking at?
Back to work!

781
01:01:01,389 --> 01:01:03,056
Feast your eyes, captain.

782
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:06,058
All of them,
faithful hands before the mast.

783
01:01:06,142 --> 01:01:09,353
Every man worth his salt...

784
01:01:09,396 --> 01:01:11,439
...and crazy to boot.

785
01:01:11,524 --> 01:01:14,359
So this is your able-bodied crew?

786
01:01:20,199 --> 01:01:21,199
You, sailor!

787
01:01:21,284 --> 01:01:22,659
Cotton, sir.

788
01:01:22,702 --> 01:01:24,493
Mr. Cotton.

789
01:01:24,536 --> 01:01:27,871
Do you have the courage and fortitude
to follow orders and stay true

790
01:01:27,956 --> 01:01:29,541
in the face of danger and death?

791
01:01:29,583 --> 01:01:31,292
Mr. Cotton!

792
01:01:31,375 --> 01:01:32,502
Answer, man!

793
01:01:32,545 --> 01:01:33,962
He's a mute, sir.

794
01:01:34,046 --> 01:01:35,756
Poor devil had his tongue cut out.

795
01:01:35,841 --> 01:01:37,881
So he trained the parrot
to talk for him.

796
01:01:37,966 --> 01:01:39,844
No one's yet figured how.

797
01:01:43,054 --> 01:01:44,681
Mr. Cotton's parrot.

798
01:01:45,682 --> 01:01:47,183
Same question.

799
01:01:47,226 --> 01:01:49,978
- Wind in your sails.
- Wind in your sails.

800
01:01:51,106 --> 01:01:53,188
Mostly, we figure that means "yes."

801
01:01:53,231 --> 01:01:54,735
Of course it does.

802
01:01:54,817 --> 01:01:55,817
Satisfied?

803
01:01:56,777 --> 01:01:58,778
Well, you've proved they're mad!

804
01:01:58,863 --> 01:02:00,739
And what's the benefit for us?

805
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:12,333
Anamaria!

806
01:02:14,253 --> 01:02:16,588
I suppose you didn't deserve
that one, either.

807
01:02:16,672 --> 01:02:18,589
No, that one I deserved.

808
01:02:18,631 --> 01:02:20,383
You stole my boat!

809
01:02:20,426 --> 01:02:21,508
Actually...

810
01:02:23,596 --> 01:02:25,972
Borrowed. Borrowed, without permission,

811
01:02:26,058 --> 01:02:28,640
but with every intention
of bringing it back to you.

812
01:02:28,725 --> 01:02:30,142
But you didn't!

813
01:02:30,226 --> 01:02:31,602
You'll get another one!

814
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:33,980
I will!

815
01:02:34,065 --> 01:02:35,439
A better one.

816
01:02:35,523 --> 01:02:37,440
A better one!

817
01:02:37,524 --> 01:02:39,110
- That one!
- What one?

818
01:02:41,822 --> 01:02:42,989
That one?

819
01:02:46,451 --> 01:02:48,161
Aye. That one.

820
01:02:48,245 --> 01:02:49,828
- What say you?
- Aye!

821
01:02:49,913 --> 01:02:51,288
Aye!

822
01:02:51,373 --> 01:02:53,373
Anchors away!

823
01:02:53,457 --> 01:02:55,667
No, no, no, no, no!
It's frightful bad luck

824
01:02:55,752 --> 01:02:57,253
to bring a woman aboard, sir.

825
01:02:57,296 --> 01:02:59,963
It'll be far worse not to have her.

826
01:03:33,666 --> 01:03:36,708
How can we sail to an island
that nobody can find,

827
01:03:36,793 --> 01:03:39,253
with a compass that doesn't work?

828
01:03:39,337 --> 01:03:41,297
Aye, the compass doesn't point north,

829
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:44,173
but we're not trying
to find north, are we?

830
01:03:54,853 --> 01:03:57,229
We should drop canvas, sir.

831
01:03:57,313 --> 01:03:59,355
She can hold a bit longer.

832
01:04:01,567 --> 01:04:05,113
What's in your head that's put you
in such a fine mood, captain?

833
01:04:05,197 --> 01:04:07,197
We're catching up.

834
01:04:22,214 --> 01:04:24,214
Time to go, poppet.

835
01:05:19,771 --> 01:05:24,190
Dead men tell no tales...

836
01:05:26,735 --> 01:05:29,404
Puts a chill in the bones,
how many honest sailors

837
01:05:29,447 --> 01:05:31,280
have been claimed by this passage.

838
01:05:46,755 --> 01:05:49,131
How is it that Jack
came by that compass?

839
01:05:49,174 --> 01:05:52,385
Not a lot's known about Jack Sparrow
'fore he showed up in Tortuga

840
01:05:52,469 --> 01:05:55,138
with a mind to go after
the treasure of Isla de Muerte.

841
01:05:55,223 --> 01:05:56,472
That was before I met him,

842
01:05:56,557 --> 01:05:58,723
back when he was captain
of the Black Pearl.

843
01:05:59,601 --> 01:06:00,602
What?

844
01:06:04,274 --> 01:06:05,732
He failed to mention that.

845
01:06:05,816 --> 01:06:08,067
He plays things closer to the vest now.

846
01:06:08,151 --> 01:06:10,237
And a hard-learned lesson it was.

847
01:06:10,321 --> 01:06:13,198
Three days out on the venture,
the first mate says,

848
01:06:13,282 --> 01:06:16,367
"Everything's an equal share.
That should mean the location

849
01:06:16,451 --> 01:06:19,830
of the treasure too,"
so Jack gives up the bearings.

850
01:06:19,998 --> 01:06:22,165
That night, there was a mutiny.

851
01:06:23,208 --> 01:06:25,877
They marooned Jack on an island
and left him to die.

852
01:06:25,962 --> 01:06:28,630
But not before he'd
gone mad with the heat.

853
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:32,009
Ah...

854
01:06:32,719 --> 01:06:35,138
So that's the reason for all the...

855
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:38,889
Reason's got nothing to do with it.

856
01:06:39,851 --> 01:06:42,019
Now, Will, when a pirate's marooned,

857
01:06:42,103 --> 01:06:44,855
he's given a pistol with a single shot.
One shot...

858
01:06:44,897 --> 01:06:48,232
Well, that won't do much good hunting,
nor to be rescued.

859
01:06:48,317 --> 01:06:51,528
But after three weeks
of a starving belly and thirst,

860
01:06:51,571 --> 01:06:54,948
that pistol starts to look
real friendly.

861
01:06:55,033 --> 01:06:57,034
But Jack, he escaped the island,

862
01:06:57,118 --> 01:06:58,701
and still has that single shot.

863
01:06:58,785 --> 01:07:01,370
Oh, he won't use it, though,
save on one man.

864
01:07:02,372 --> 01:07:04,415
His mutinous first mate.

865
01:07:04,499 --> 01:07:06,459
- Barbossa.
- Aye.

866
01:07:07,711 --> 01:07:10,672
- How did Jack get off the island?
- Well, I'll tell ye.

867
01:07:10,715 --> 01:07:12,842
He waded out into the shallows,

868
01:07:12,885 --> 01:07:15,468
and he waited there three days
and three nights,

869
01:07:15,553 --> 01:07:19,389
till all manner of sea creatures
came acclimated to his presence.

870
01:07:20,390 --> 01:07:21,933
And on the fourth morning,

871
01:07:22,018 --> 01:07:26,146
he roped a couple of sea turtles,
lashed them together and made a raft.

872
01:07:28,399 --> 01:07:30,815
- He roped a couple of sea turtles.
- Aye.

873
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:32,194
Sea turtles!

874
01:07:34,447 --> 01:07:36,447
What did he use for rope?

875
01:07:41,412 --> 01:07:42,995
Human hair.

876
01:07:43,997 --> 01:07:45,414
From my back.

877
01:07:46,582 --> 01:07:47,959
Let go the anchor!

878
01:07:48,044 --> 01:07:50,419
Lower the anchor line!

879
01:07:50,504 --> 01:07:52,921
Young Mr. Turner and I are to go ashore.

880
01:07:53,547 --> 01:07:54,675
Captain.

881
01:07:54,759 --> 01:07:56,467
What if the worst should happen?

882
01:07:57,345 --> 01:07:59,846
- Keep to the code.
- Aye. The code.

883
01:08:25,665 --> 01:08:26,831
Move.

884
01:08:26,915 --> 01:08:28,916
Ten years of hoarding swag!

885
01:08:28,959 --> 01:08:31,459
And now we finally get to spend it!

886
01:08:34,298 --> 01:08:35,298
Oh.

887
01:08:38,802 --> 01:08:41,596
Once we're quit of the curse,
we'll be rich men...

888
01:08:42,306 --> 01:08:46,015
...and you can buy an eye what
actually fits and is made of glass.

889
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:49,020
This one does splinter
something terrible!

890
01:08:49,105 --> 01:08:51,314
Stop rubbing it!

891
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:53,566
Oh!

892
01:09:10,959 --> 01:09:14,003
What code is Gibbs to keep to
if the worst should happen?

893
01:09:14,045 --> 01:09:16,337
The pirates' code.

894
01:09:16,423 --> 01:09:17,839
Any man who falls behind...

895
01:09:17,882 --> 01:09:20,216
...is left behind.

896
01:09:21,553 --> 01:09:23,846
No heroes amongst thieves, eh?

897
01:09:24,558 --> 01:09:27,641
You know, for having
such a bleak outlook on pirates,

898
01:09:27,684 --> 01:09:30,602
you're well on your way
to becoming one.

899
01:09:31,104 --> 01:09:32,688
Sprung a man from jail...

900
01:09:34,024 --> 01:09:36,524
...commandeered a ship of the fleet,

901
01:09:36,567 --> 01:09:39,111
sailed with a buccaneer crew
out of Tortuga...

902
01:09:41,281 --> 01:09:44,532
...and you're completely
obsessed with treasure!

903
01:09:47,287 --> 01:09:48,412
That's not true.

904
01:09:49,122 --> 01:09:50,872
I am not obsessed with treasure.

905
01:09:58,089 --> 01:10:00,840
Not all treasure
is silver and gold, mate.

906
01:10:00,883 --> 01:10:02,927
Gentlemen, the time has come!

907
01:10:03,011 --> 01:10:04,221
Hurrah!

908
01:10:04,305 --> 01:10:06,430
Salvation is nigh!

909
01:10:06,515 --> 01:10:07,931
Yeah!

910
01:10:08,015 --> 01:10:10,726
- Our torment is near an end!
- Elizabeth.

911
01:10:11,394 --> 01:10:14,271
For ten years,
we've been tested and tried,

912
01:10:14,355 --> 01:10:15,981
and each man-jack of you here

913
01:10:16,066 --> 01:10:19,068
has proved his mettle 100 times over.

914
01:10:19,110 --> 01:10:21,403
And 100 times again!

915
01:10:21,446 --> 01:10:23,530
Yeah!

916
01:10:23,572 --> 01:10:25,157
Suffered, I have!

917
01:10:25,908 --> 01:10:27,743
Punished, we were,

918
01:10:27,786 --> 01:10:29,327
the lot of us,

919
01:10:29,411 --> 01:10:32,747
disproportionate to our crime!

920
01:10:32,833 --> 01:10:34,625
Right!

921
01:10:34,709 --> 01:10:35,917
Here it is!

922
01:10:39,588 --> 01:10:43,217
The cursed treasure of Cortés himself.

923
01:10:45,218 --> 01:10:47,763
Every last piece that went astray,

924
01:10:47,806 --> 01:10:49,557
we have returned.

925
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:51,307
Save for this!

926
01:10:51,392 --> 01:10:52,810
- Yeah!
- Jack!

927
01:10:52,894 --> 01:10:55,521
Not yet!

928
01:10:55,605 --> 01:10:58,106
We'll wait for the opportune moment.

929
01:10:58,190 --> 01:11:00,941
...Despairing
of ever finding the lass.

930
01:11:00,984 --> 01:11:02,821
When's that?

931
01:11:02,905 --> 01:11:05,614
When it's of greatest profit to you?

932
01:11:05,657 --> 01:11:06,990
May I ask you something?

933
01:11:08,367 --> 01:11:10,702
Have I ever given you
reason not to trust me?

934
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,079
Do us a favor.

935
01:11:13,122 --> 01:11:15,248
I know it's difficult for you,

936
01:11:15,291 --> 01:11:17,333
but please, stay here,

937
01:11:17,418 --> 01:11:20,295
and try not to do anything stupid.

938
01:11:22,965 --> 01:11:25,467
And who among us
has paid the blood sacrifice

939
01:11:25,552 --> 01:11:27,803
- owed to the heathen gods?
- Aye!

940
01:11:27,888 --> 01:11:30,723
And whose blood must yet be paid?

941
01:11:30,807 --> 01:11:32,473
Hers!

942
01:11:34,643 --> 01:11:39,229
You know the first thing I'm going
to do after the curse is lifted?

943
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:44,986
Eat a whole bushel of apples!

944
01:11:52,745 --> 01:11:54,746
Begun by blood,

945
01:11:54,830 --> 01:11:56,832
by blood undone.

946
01:12:01,294 --> 01:12:02,338
Sorry, Jack.

947
01:12:02,422 --> 01:12:04,963
I'm not going to be your leverage.

948
01:12:14,182 --> 01:12:16,350
That's it?

949
01:12:16,392 --> 01:12:18,062
Waste not.

950
01:12:56,058 --> 01:12:57,392
Did it work?

951
01:12:57,434 --> 01:13:00,311
- I don't feel no different.
- How do we tell?

952
01:13:07,402 --> 01:13:08,903
You're not dead!

953
01:13:09,947 --> 01:13:12,448
No.

954
01:13:12,533 --> 01:13:13,865
He shot me!

955
01:13:13,908 --> 01:13:17,453
It didn't work!
The curse is still upon us!

956
01:13:22,543 --> 01:13:25,004
You! Maid! Your father,
what was his name?

957
01:13:25,088 --> 01:13:27,338
Was your father William Turner?

958
01:13:27,673 --> 01:13:28,922
No.

959
01:13:28,965 --> 01:13:32,468
Where's his child? The child that sailed
from England eight years ago?

960
01:13:32,553 --> 01:13:35,596
The child in whose veins flows
the blood of William Turner?

961
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:36,931
Where?

962
01:13:43,312 --> 01:13:44,480
You two!

963
01:13:45,605 --> 01:13:47,692
- You brought us the wrong person!
- Yeah!

964
01:13:48,651 --> 01:13:49,651
No!

965
01:13:50,405 --> 01:13:53,113
She had the medallion!
She's the proper age!

966
01:13:53,198 --> 01:13:55,825
She said her name
was Turner. You heard her!

967
01:13:57,703 --> 01:14:00,371
- I think she lied to us!
- Yeah!

968
01:14:01,622 --> 01:14:03,957
You brought us here for nothing!

969
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:08,128
I won't take questionin' or second
guesses, not from you, Mr. Twigg!

970
01:14:08,171 --> 01:14:12,468
Who's to blame him? Every decision
you made has led us from bad to worse!

971
01:14:14,678 --> 01:14:17,263
It was you who sent
Bootstrap to the depths!

972
01:14:17,306 --> 01:14:18,305
Yeah!

973
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:23,685
And it's you who brought us
here in the first place!

974
01:14:25,481 --> 01:14:28,148
If any coward here dare challenge me,
let him speak!

975
01:14:30,443 --> 01:14:32,361
I say, we cut her throat,

976
01:14:32,446 --> 01:14:34,071
and spill all her blood!

977
01:14:34,155 --> 01:14:35,156
Just in case.

978
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:36,656
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

979
01:14:36,741 --> 01:14:39,284
Yeah!

980
01:14:45,249 --> 01:14:46,500
The medallion!

981
01:14:46,542 --> 01:14:47,835
She's taken it!

982
01:14:47,877 --> 01:14:52,381
Get after her,
you feckless pack of ingrates!

983
01:14:57,970 --> 01:15:00,972
- Where's the oars?
- There's no oars!

984
01:15:01,015 --> 01:15:03,851
The oars have gone missing!
Find them!

985
01:15:12,944 --> 01:15:14,695
You!

986
01:15:16,030 --> 01:15:17,698
You're supposed to be dead!

987
01:15:17,741 --> 01:15:19,075
Am I not?

988
01:15:21,035 --> 01:15:22,035
Oh.

989
01:15:29,127 --> 01:15:30,584
Puh-la-lem.

990
01:15:31,965 --> 01:15:34,215
Puh-la-lie-lay-lool.

991
01:15:36,802 --> 01:15:38,426
Pah-lee-nee...

992
01:15:38,511 --> 01:15:41,263
...parsnip... par-sley...

993
01:15:41,348 --> 01:15:43,348
...par... partner, pardoner...

994
01:15:43,391 --> 01:15:44,390
Parley?

995
01:15:44,474 --> 01:15:46,309
That's the one! Parley!

996
01:15:47,061 --> 01:15:48,062
Parley!

997
01:15:48,105 --> 01:15:49,397
Parley?!

998
01:15:50,648 --> 01:15:54,443
Damn to the depths whatever
muttonhead thought up parley!

999
01:15:56,070 --> 01:15:58,363
That would be the French.

1000
01:16:10,168 --> 01:16:11,377
Not more pirates!

1001
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:13,461
Welcome aboard, Miss Elizabeth.

1002
01:16:14,423 --> 01:16:15,629
Mr. Gibbs?

1003
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:17,632
Hey, boy, where be Jack?

1004
01:16:18,759 --> 01:16:21,262
Jack? Jack Sparrow?

1005
01:16:22,512 --> 01:16:24,014
He fell behind.

1006
01:16:31,563 --> 01:16:33,107
Keep to the code!

1007
01:16:34,358 --> 01:16:37,151
- Weigh anchor!
- Hoist the sails!

1008
01:16:37,235 --> 01:16:38,904
Split-quick, you dibbies!

1009
01:16:45,118 --> 01:16:48,163
How the blazes
did you get off that island?

1010
01:16:49,540 --> 01:16:53,000
When you marooned me on
that godforsaken spit of land,

1011
01:16:53,084 --> 01:16:55,463
you forgot one
very important thing, mate.

1012
01:16:57,047 --> 01:16:59,465
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

1013
01:16:59,507 --> 01:17:03,136
Ah, well, I won't be
making that mistake...

1014
01:17:03,179 --> 01:17:04,388
...again.

1015
01:17:05,181 --> 01:17:08,641
Gents, you all remember
Captain Jack Sparrow?

1016
01:17:08,725 --> 01:17:09,934
Aye.

1017
01:17:10,687 --> 01:17:11,687
Kill him.

1018
01:17:12,855 --> 01:17:15,522
The girl's blood didn't work, did it?

1019
01:17:18,194 --> 01:17:19,360
Hold your fire!

1020
01:17:25,992 --> 01:17:28,536
You know whose blood we need?

1021
01:17:30,248 --> 01:17:32,122
I know whose blood you need.

1022
01:17:39,257 --> 01:17:41,839
What sort of a man
trades a man's life for a ship?

1023
01:17:41,924 --> 01:17:43,176
A pirate.

1024
01:17:44,343 --> 01:17:45,680
Here.

1025
01:17:45,764 --> 01:17:47,472
Let me.

1026
01:17:47,515 --> 01:17:49,016
Thank you.

1027
01:17:50,393 --> 01:17:52,977
You said you gave Barbossa
my name as yours.

1028
01:17:54,855 --> 01:17:55,855
Why?

1029
01:17:59,192 --> 01:18:00,483
I don't know.

1030
01:18:02,446 --> 01:18:04,656
I'm sorry. A blacksmith's hands.

1031
01:18:04,699 --> 01:18:09,286
- I know they're rough.
- No... I mean, yes, they are, but...

1032
01:18:11,746 --> 01:18:13,539
But don't stop.

1033
01:18:22,048 --> 01:18:23,465
Elizabeth!

1034
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:40,734
It's yours.

1035
01:18:45,155 --> 01:18:48,575
I thought I'd lost it
the day they rescued me.

1036
01:18:48,617 --> 01:18:50,075
It was a gift from my father.

1037
01:18:50,118 --> 01:18:52,245
He sent it to me.

1038
01:18:57,918 --> 01:18:59,460
Why did you take it?

1039
01:19:01,588 --> 01:19:04,340
Because I was afraid
that you were a pirate.

1040
01:19:05,925 --> 01:19:07,718
That would've been awful.

1041
01:19:11,181 --> 01:19:12,973
It wasn't your blood they needed.

1042
01:19:15,769 --> 01:19:18,021
It was my father's blood.

1043
01:19:20,482 --> 01:19:23,067
My blood.

1044
01:19:27,990 --> 01:19:29,365
The blood of a pirate.

1045
01:19:29,449 --> 01:19:31,575
Will, I'm so sorry.
Please forgive me.

1046
01:19:44,924 --> 01:19:48,550
So you expect to leave me standin' on
some beach, with nothing but a name

1047
01:19:48,635 --> 01:19:53,972
and your word it's the one I need,
and watch you sail away in my ship?

1048
01:19:54,057 --> 01:19:55,224
No.

1049
01:19:55,308 --> 01:19:59,436
I expect to leave you standing on some
beach with absolutely no name at all,

1050
01:19:59,479 --> 01:20:01,564
watching me sail away on my ship,

1051
01:20:01,649 --> 01:20:04,525
and then I'll shout
the name back to you.

1052
01:20:04,609 --> 01:20:05,943
Savvy?

1053
01:20:05,985 --> 01:20:09,029
That still leaves the problem
of me standing on some beach,

1054
01:20:09,114 --> 01:20:12,950
with naught but a name and your word
it's the one I need.

1055
01:20:13,992 --> 01:20:15,327
Of the two of us,

1056
01:20:15,412 --> 01:20:19,206
I am the only one who
hasn't committed mutiny.

1057
01:20:19,290 --> 01:20:23,292
Therefore, my word is
the one we'll be trusting.

1058
01:20:23,335 --> 01:20:25,088
Although...

1059
01:20:25,172 --> 01:20:27,798
I suppose I should be thanking you
because, in fact,

1060
01:20:27,841 --> 01:20:30,133
if you hadn't betrayed me
and left me to die,

1061
01:20:31,176 --> 01:20:35,473
I would have an equal share
in that curse, same as you.

1062
01:20:35,516 --> 01:20:36,890
Funny ol' world, isn't it?

1063
01:20:36,974 --> 01:20:38,307
Hm.

1064
01:20:40,895 --> 01:20:43,396
Captain! We're coming up
on the Interceptor.

1065
01:20:56,536 --> 01:20:58,578
I'm having a thought here, Barbossa.

1066
01:20:59,246 --> 01:21:01,038
What say we run up a flag of truce,

1067
01:21:01,123 --> 01:21:02,916
I scurry over to the Interceptor,

1068
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,462
and I negotiate the return of your
medallion. What say you to that?

1069
01:21:07,422 --> 01:21:10,924
You see, Jack, that's exactly
the attitude that lost you the Pearl.

1070
01:21:11,009 --> 01:21:13,927
People are easier to search
when they're dead.

1071
01:21:14,970 --> 01:21:16,305
Lock him in the brig.

1072
01:21:28,567 --> 01:21:31,026
Hands aloft to loose ta'gallants!

1073
01:21:31,068 --> 01:21:34,363
With this wind dead astern,
she'll carry every sail we've got.

1074
01:21:34,406 --> 01:21:36,866
- What's happening?
- The Black Pearl!

1075
01:21:36,909 --> 01:21:38,116
She's gaining on us!

1076
01:21:42,707 --> 01:21:45,083
This is the fastest ship
in the Caribbean!

1077
01:21:45,168 --> 01:21:47,920
You can tell them that
after they've caught us!

1078
01:21:47,962 --> 01:21:49,879
We're shallower on the draft, right?

1079
01:21:49,922 --> 01:21:50,923
Aye.

1080
01:21:51,007 --> 01:21:53,089
Can't we lose them amongst those shoals?

1081
01:21:54,552 --> 01:21:56,260
We don't have to outrun 'em long.

1082
01:21:56,303 --> 01:21:57,597
Just long enough.

1083
01:21:57,640 --> 01:21:58,930
Lighten the ship!

1084
01:21:59,014 --> 01:22:00,181
Stem to stern!

1085
01:22:00,265 --> 01:22:03,352
Anything we can afford to lose,
see that it's lost!

1086
01:22:12,778 --> 01:22:14,780
Apparently, there's a leak.

1087
01:22:29,461 --> 01:22:32,631
Haul on the main brace!
Make ready the guns!

1088
01:22:32,674 --> 01:22:34,882
And run out the sweeps.

1089
01:23:03,119 --> 01:23:04,787
We're gonna need that.

1090
01:23:13,464 --> 01:23:16,257
It was a good plan, up till now.

1091
01:23:16,342 --> 01:23:17,800
Gibbs!

1092
01:23:17,843 --> 01:23:19,260
We have to make a stand.

1093
01:23:19,344 --> 01:23:20,762
We must fight!

1094
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:23,806
- Load the guns!
- With what?

1095
01:23:23,850 --> 01:23:25,600
Anything! Everything!

1096
01:23:25,684 --> 01:23:27,393
Anything we have left!

1097
01:23:29,439 --> 01:23:31,397
Load the guns!

1098
01:23:31,481 --> 01:23:33,190
Case shot and langrage!

1099
01:23:33,275 --> 01:23:34,859
Nails and crushed glass!

1100
01:23:37,403 --> 01:23:38,572
With a will!

1101
01:23:59,884 --> 01:24:02,720
The Pearl's gonna luff up
on our port quarter!

1102
01:24:02,804 --> 01:24:05,389
She'll rake us without ever
presenting a target!

1103
01:24:05,431 --> 01:24:07,516
Lower the anchor on the right side.

1104
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:09,518
On the starboard side!

1105
01:24:10,563 --> 01:24:13,690
- It has the element of surprise.
- You're daft, lady!

1106
01:24:13,733 --> 01:24:14,732
You both are!

1107
01:24:14,815 --> 01:24:16,233
Daft like Jack!

1108
01:24:16,944 --> 01:24:18,444
Lower the starboard anchor!

1109
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:22,614
Do it, you gobs, or it's you
we'll load into the cannons!

1110
01:24:22,698 --> 01:24:24,241
Aye!

1111
01:24:41,093 --> 01:24:42,343
Let go!

1112
01:24:48,935 --> 01:24:50,601
They're club haulin'!

1113
01:24:50,686 --> 01:24:53,436
Hard a port!
Rack the starboard oars!

1114
01:24:53,521 --> 01:24:55,272
Hard a port!

1115
01:25:06,659 --> 01:25:07,910
Keep her steady, man.

1116
01:25:14,959 --> 01:25:15,959
Now!

1117
01:25:16,043 --> 01:25:18,337
Fire!

1118
01:25:28,097 --> 01:25:30,098
Stop blowing holes in my ship!

1119
01:26:16,687 --> 01:26:18,856
We could use a few more ideas, lass!

1120
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:20,523
It's your turn!

1121
01:26:20,566 --> 01:26:22,358
We need us a devil's dowry!

1122
01:26:22,401 --> 01:26:23,734
We'll give them her!

1123
01:26:24,738 --> 01:26:26,237
She's not what they're after.

1124
01:26:28,824 --> 01:26:30,158
The medallion!

1125
01:26:52,263 --> 01:26:54,849
Strike your colors,
you bloomin' cockroaches!

1126
01:26:54,892 --> 01:26:57,644
Hands, grapnels, at the ready!

1127
01:26:57,728 --> 01:26:59,563
Prepare to board!

1128
01:27:07,196 --> 01:27:08,402
Ahh!

1129
01:27:33,889 --> 01:27:36,723
Pistols and cutlasses, men!

1130
01:27:36,766 --> 01:27:39,060
Koehler and Twigg
to the powder magazine!

1131
01:27:39,103 --> 01:27:42,438
And the rest of you,
bring me the medallion!

1132
01:27:51,991 --> 01:27:54,410
Hey! Hey!

1133
01:28:10,218 --> 01:28:12,845
Hey! Below!

1134
01:28:32,656 --> 01:28:34,157
Thanks very much.

1135
01:28:37,493 --> 01:28:39,079
Ha-haa!

1136
01:28:43,459 --> 01:28:46,084
Whoa!

1137
01:28:47,547 --> 01:28:48,546
Jack!

1138
01:28:49,924 --> 01:28:51,715
Bloody empty!

1139
01:29:07,648 --> 01:29:09,526
That's not very nice.

1140
01:29:14,156 --> 01:29:15,364
Where is the medallion?

1141
01:29:15,406 --> 01:29:16,492
Wretch!

1142
01:29:18,243 --> 01:29:19,452
Ah...

1143
01:29:19,536 --> 01:29:20,869
Where is dear William?

1144
01:29:23,081 --> 01:29:24,331
Will!

1145
01:29:26,542 --> 01:29:28,752
- Will!
- Elizabeth!

1146
01:29:31,716 --> 01:29:32,840
Monkey!

1147
01:29:39,515 --> 01:29:41,349
I can't move it!

1148
01:29:42,725 --> 01:29:43,725
Will!

1149
01:29:43,768 --> 01:29:44,894
Elizabeth!

1150
01:29:44,936 --> 01:29:46,019
Will!

1151
01:29:57,116 --> 01:29:59,241
Why, thank you, Jack.

1152
01:29:59,325 --> 01:30:00,951
You're welcome.

1153
01:30:01,035 --> 01:30:03,622
Not you. We named the monkey Jack.

1154
01:30:04,831 --> 01:30:07,749
Gents! Our hope is restored!

1155
01:30:07,834 --> 01:30:09,252
Yeah!

1156
01:30:43,786 --> 01:30:47,789
Any of you so much
as thinks the word parley,

1157
01:30:47,874 --> 01:30:50,625
I'll have your guts for garters!

1158
01:30:58,509 --> 01:30:59,926
Will!

1159
01:30:59,969 --> 01:31:01,970
Stop it! Stop it!

1160
01:31:02,847 --> 01:31:04,805
Welcome back, miss.

1161
01:31:04,890 --> 01:31:07,641
You took advantage of
our hospitality last time.

1162
01:31:07,684 --> 01:31:11,022
It holds fair now
that you return the favor!

1163
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:14,316
No! No!

1164
01:31:16,986 --> 01:31:18,071
Barbossa!

1165
01:31:20,031 --> 01:31:21,032
Will.

1166
01:31:23,826 --> 01:31:24,826
She goes free!

1167
01:31:25,952 --> 01:31:27,663
What's in your head, boy?

1168
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:30,332
She goes free.

1169
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:34,045
You've only got one shot,
and we can't die.

1170
01:31:34,129 --> 01:31:36,129
Don't do anything stupid!

1171
01:31:39,093 --> 01:31:40,342
You can't.

1172
01:31:40,426 --> 01:31:41,842
I can.

1173
01:31:43,555 --> 01:31:45,179
Like that.

1174
01:31:46,226 --> 01:31:47,516
Who are you?

1175
01:31:47,558 --> 01:31:49,060
No one! He's no one!

1176
01:31:49,811 --> 01:31:52,813
A distant cousin of my aunt's
nephew, twice removed.

1177
01:31:52,855 --> 01:31:55,357
- Lovely singing voice, though.
- Eunuch!

1178
01:31:55,399 --> 01:31:57,066
My name is Will Turner!

1179
01:31:57,150 --> 01:31:59,861
My father was Bootstrap Bill Turner.

1180
01:31:59,904 --> 01:32:01,864
His blood runs in my veins.

1181
01:32:02,574 --> 01:32:04,866
It's the spitting image
of ol' Bootstrap Bill,

1182
01:32:04,951 --> 01:32:06,742
come back to haunt us!

1183
01:32:06,827 --> 01:32:08,830
On my word, do as I say,

1184
01:32:08,872 --> 01:32:10,747
or I'll pull this trigger,

1185
01:32:10,832 --> 01:32:13,040
and be lost to Davy Jones' locker!

1186
01:32:14,084 --> 01:32:16,378
Name your terms, Mr. Turner.

1187
01:32:16,420 --> 01:32:17,587
Elizabeth goes free!

1188
01:32:17,673 --> 01:32:19,297
Yes, we know that one.

1189
01:32:19,382 --> 01:32:20,382
Anything else?

1190
01:32:23,051 --> 01:32:24,345
And the crew!

1191
01:32:24,388 --> 01:32:26,346
The crew are not to be harmed!

1192
01:32:31,103 --> 01:32:32,893
Agreed.

1193
01:32:39,109 --> 01:32:42,571
Go on, poppet. Walk the plank.

1194
01:32:52,081 --> 01:32:53,749
Barbossa, you lying bastard!

1195
01:32:53,833 --> 01:32:56,418
You swore she'd go free!

1196
01:32:56,502 --> 01:32:58,754
Don't dare impugn me honor, boy!

1197
01:32:58,838 --> 01:33:00,504
I agreed she'd go free.

1198
01:33:00,589 --> 01:33:03,592
It was you who failed to specify
when or where.

1199
01:33:09,307 --> 01:33:13,268
Though it does seem a shame to lose
something so fine, don't it, lads?

1200
01:33:13,311 --> 01:33:14,311
Aye.

1201
01:33:15,313 --> 01:33:18,481
So I'll be havin' that dress
back before you go.

1202
01:33:22,819 --> 01:33:24,947
I always liked you.

1203
01:33:27,950 --> 01:33:30,285
Goes with your black heart!

1204
01:33:30,870 --> 01:33:33,037
Mm. It's still warm.

1205
01:33:36,416 --> 01:33:38,460
Off you go!

1206
01:33:38,543 --> 01:33:39,878
Come on!

1207
01:33:43,507 --> 01:33:44,673
Too long!

1208
01:33:55,811 --> 01:33:58,312
I really rather hoped
we were past all this.

1209
01:33:59,899 --> 01:34:01,315
Jack.

1210
01:34:01,358 --> 01:34:02,443
Jack!

1211
01:34:04,194 --> 01:34:05,654
Did ya not notice?

1212
01:34:05,738 --> 01:34:09,990
That be the same island we made you
governor of on our last little trip.

1213
01:34:11,284 --> 01:34:12,952
I did notice.

1214
01:34:12,994 --> 01:34:17,164
Perhaps you'll be able to conjure up
another miraculous escape,

1215
01:34:17,207 --> 01:34:18,833
but I doubt it.

1216
01:34:21,670 --> 01:34:23,212
Off you go.

1217
01:34:24,214 --> 01:34:26,840
Last time you left me
a pistol with one shot.

1218
01:34:26,925 --> 01:34:28,509
By the powers, you're right!

1219
01:34:28,592 --> 01:34:30,721
Where be Jack's pistol?

1220
01:34:30,805 --> 01:34:31,972
Bring it forward.

1221
01:34:35,142 --> 01:34:37,936
Seeing as there's two of us,
a gentleman...

1222
01:34:38,645 --> 01:34:40,438
...would give us a pair of pistols.

1223
01:34:40,523 --> 01:34:42,231
It'll be one pistol, as before,

1224
01:34:42,315 --> 01:34:45,108
and you can be the gentleman
and shoot the lady,

1225
01:34:45,192 --> 01:34:47,028
and starve to death yourself!

1226
01:35:11,386 --> 01:35:14,930
That's the second time I've had to watch
that man sail away with my ship.

1227
01:35:17,393 --> 01:35:20,060
You were marooned on this island
before, weren't you?

1228
01:35:20,144 --> 01:35:21,730
We can escape the same way!

1229
01:35:21,772 --> 01:35:23,898
To what point and purpose, young missy?

1230
01:35:24,650 --> 01:35:26,400
The Black Pearl is gone,

1231
01:35:26,443 --> 01:35:29,903
and unless you have a rudder and
a lot of sails hidden in that bodice...

1232
01:35:29,988 --> 01:35:32,406
Unlikely...

1233
01:35:32,449 --> 01:35:35,408
Young Mr. Turner will be dead
long before you can reach him.

1234
01:35:38,079 --> 01:35:40,414
But you're Captain Jack Sparrow!

1235
01:35:40,457 --> 01:35:44,877
You vanished from under the eyes of
seven agents of the East India Company!

1236
01:35:44,919 --> 01:35:47,672
You sacked Nassau Port
without even firing a shot!

1237
01:35:47,757 --> 01:35:50,007
Are you the pirate
I've read about or not?

1238
01:35:52,552 --> 01:35:54,053
How did you escape last time?

1239
01:36:00,894 --> 01:36:02,769
Last time...

1240
01:36:02,811 --> 01:36:05,605
...I was here a grand total
of three days, all right?

1241
01:36:06,608 --> 01:36:07,608
Last time...

1242
01:36:09,652 --> 01:36:12,946
...the rum runners used this island
as a cache.

1243
01:36:12,989 --> 01:36:15,448
They came by and I was able
to barter passage off.

1244
01:36:15,532 --> 01:36:17,285
From the looks of things,

1245
01:36:17,370 --> 01:36:19,578
they've long been out of business.

1246
01:36:19,621 --> 01:36:24,750
You probably have your bloody friend
Norrington to thank for that.

1247
01:36:24,793 --> 01:36:26,334
So that's it then?

1248
01:36:27,628 --> 01:36:31,465
That's the secret, grand adventure
of the infamous Jack Sparrow!

1249
01:36:32,468 --> 01:36:34,259
You spent three days,

1250
01:36:34,302 --> 01:36:36,637
lying on a beach, drinking rum.

1251
01:36:39,016 --> 01:36:42,809
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.

1252
01:36:50,860 --> 01:36:53,027
♪ We're devils
We're black sheep

1253
01:36:53,112 --> 01:36:54,279
♪ We're really bad eggs

1254
01:36:54,322 --> 01:36:56,948
♪ Drink up, me hearties
Yo ho

1255
01:36:56,991 --> 01:37:00,952
♪ Yo ho, yo ho
A pirate's life for me

1256
01:37:00,994 --> 01:37:02,830
I love this song!

1257
01:37:05,833 --> 01:37:08,000
Really bad eggs!

1258
01:37:09,421 --> 01:37:11,422
Ooh...

1259
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:14,882
When I get the Pearl back,

1260
01:37:14,966 --> 01:37:17,468
I'm gonna teach it to the whole crew,

1261
01:37:17,511 --> 01:37:19,054
and we'll sing it all the time!

1262
01:37:19,139 --> 01:37:22,932
And you will be positively the most
fearsome pirates in the Spanish Main!

1263
01:37:23,016 --> 01:37:24,851
Not just the Spanish Main, love.

1264
01:37:25,895 --> 01:37:27,603
The entire ocean!

1265
01:37:27,688 --> 01:37:29,440
The entire world!

1266
01:37:30,357 --> 01:37:32,358
Wherever we want to go, we go.

1267
01:37:32,401 --> 01:37:33,985
That's what a ship is, you know.

1268
01:37:34,027 --> 01:37:36,864
It's not just a keel and a hull
and a deck and sails.

1269
01:37:36,948 --> 01:37:38,449
That's what a ship needs.

1270
01:37:38,533 --> 01:37:40,534
But what a ship is...

1271
01:37:41,911 --> 01:37:44,871
What the Black Pearl really is...

1272
01:37:46,332 --> 01:37:49,584
...is freedom.

1273
01:37:50,585 --> 01:37:51,670
Jack...

1274
01:37:51,713 --> 01:37:56,467
It must be really terrible for you
to be trapped on this island.

1275
01:37:57,258 --> 01:37:58,469
Oh, yes.

1276
01:37:58,553 --> 01:38:01,389
But the company is...

1277
01:38:01,432 --> 01:38:04,224
...infinitely better than last time,
and the...

1278
01:38:06,018 --> 01:38:09,729
...scenery has definitely improved.
- Mr. Sparrow!

1279
01:38:09,771 --> 01:38:13,817
I'm not entirely sure I've had
enough rum to allow that kind of talk.

1280
01:38:15,444 --> 01:38:17,237
I know exactly what you mean, love.

1281
01:38:24,745 --> 01:38:26,289
To freedom!

1282
01:38:29,041 --> 01:38:30,583
To the Black Pearl.

1283
01:38:47,184 --> 01:38:50,228
Hm?

1284
01:39:00,113 --> 01:39:01,199
No!

1285
01:39:01,283 --> 01:39:04,076
Not good! Stop!

1286
01:39:04,117 --> 01:39:05,326
Not good!

1287
01:39:05,410 --> 01:39:06,410
What are you doing?

1288
01:39:06,453 --> 01:39:08,539
You've burned all the food, the shade...

1289
01:39:08,623 --> 01:39:10,874
...the rum!
- Yes, the rum is gone.

1290
01:39:10,959 --> 01:39:12,207
Why is the rum gone?

1291
01:39:12,667 --> 01:39:14,543
One, because it is a vile drink

1292
01:39:14,627 --> 01:39:17,548
that turns even the most respectable
men into scoundrels.

1293
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:20,717
Two, that signal
is over 1,000 feet high.

1294
01:39:20,802 --> 01:39:23,010
The entire Royal Navy
is out looking for me.

1295
01:39:23,095 --> 01:39:25,471
Do you think there is even
the slightest chance

1296
01:39:25,514 --> 01:39:26,681
they won't see it?

1297
01:39:26,765 --> 01:39:28,598
But why is the rum gone?

1298
01:39:29,685 --> 01:39:31,143
Just wait, Captain Sparrow.

1299
01:39:31,186 --> 01:39:32,981
You give it one hour, maybe two,

1300
01:39:33,065 --> 01:39:37,983
keep a weather eye open, and you
will see white sails on that horizon.

1301
01:39:43,490 --> 01:39:46,492
"Must've been terrible for you
to be trapped here, Jack."

1302
01:39:46,535 --> 01:39:49,620
"Must've been terrible for you..."
Well, it bloody is now!

1303
01:39:57,003 --> 01:39:59,254
There'll be no
living with her after this.

1304
01:40:00,256 --> 01:40:03,842
- We've got to save Will!
- No! You're safe now.

1305
01:40:03,926 --> 01:40:06,012
We will return to
Port Royal immediately,

1306
01:40:06,096 --> 01:40:08,056
not go gallivanting after pirates!

1307
01:40:08,141 --> 01:40:10,058
Then we condemn him to death!

1308
01:40:11,144 --> 01:40:13,852
The boy's fate is regrettable...

1309
01:40:13,936 --> 01:40:16,522
...but then, so was his decision
to engage in piracy.

1310
01:40:16,607 --> 01:40:19,859
To rescue me! To prevent anything
from happening to me!

1311
01:40:19,943 --> 01:40:23,780
If I may be so bold as to interject
my professional opinion,

1312
01:40:23,865 --> 01:40:27,033
the Pearl was listing
near to scuppers after the battle.

1313
01:40:27,075 --> 01:40:29,993
It's very unlikely she'd be able
to make good time.

1314
01:40:30,036 --> 01:40:31,370
Think about it.

1315
01:40:31,455 --> 01:40:33,664
The Black Pearl.

1316
01:40:33,707 --> 01:40:38,210
The last real pirate threat
in the Caribbean, mate.

1317
01:40:38,253 --> 01:40:40,213
How can you pass that up?

1318
01:40:42,382 --> 01:40:45,217
By remembering that I serve others,
Mr. Sparrow,

1319
01:40:45,260 --> 01:40:47,762
- not only myself.
- Commodore, I beg you!

1320
01:40:47,847 --> 01:40:48,845
Please do this!

1321
01:40:48,888 --> 01:40:50,513
For me!

1322
01:40:50,556 --> 01:40:52,725
As a wedding gift.

1323
01:40:52,808 --> 01:40:53,975
Elizabeth?

1324
01:40:55,062 --> 01:40:57,605
Are you accepting
the commodore's proposal?

1325
01:41:00,024 --> 01:41:01,067
I am.

1326
01:41:01,902 --> 01:41:03,569
A wedding! I love weddings!

1327
01:41:03,654 --> 01:41:05,404
Drinks all around!

1328
01:41:07,698 --> 01:41:10,451
I know. "Clap him in irons," right?

1329
01:41:12,997 --> 01:41:14,162
Mr. Sparrow...

1330
01:41:15,499 --> 01:41:17,833
...you will accompany
these fine men to the helm

1331
01:41:17,919 --> 01:41:20,419
and provide us with a bearing
to Isla de Muerta.

1332
01:41:20,462 --> 01:41:24,382
You'll then spend the rest of the voyage
contemplating all possible meanings

1333
01:41:24,424 --> 01:41:26,925
of the phrase "silent as the grave."

1334
01:41:26,967 --> 01:41:28,550
Do I make myself clear?

1335
01:41:28,593 --> 01:41:30,681
Inescapably clear.

1336
01:41:34,685 --> 01:41:36,936
Shiver me timbers!

1337
01:41:37,728 --> 01:41:39,355
Cotton says you missed a bit.

1338
01:41:44,359 --> 01:41:45,735
You knew William Turner?

1339
01:41:47,614 --> 01:41:49,699
Old Bootstrap Bill.

1340
01:41:49,783 --> 01:41:50,783
We knew him.

1341
01:41:51,784 --> 01:41:55,787
Never sat well with Bootstrap,
what we did to Jack Sparrow,

1342
01:41:55,830 --> 01:41:57,915
the mutiny and all.

1343
01:41:58,498 --> 01:42:00,501
He said it wasn't right with the code.

1344
01:42:01,585 --> 01:42:04,755
That's why he sent off a piece
of the treasure to you, as it were.

1345
01:42:04,798 --> 01:42:08,425
He said we deserved to be cursed...

1346
01:42:10,012 --> 01:42:12,096
...and remain cursed.

1347
01:42:12,139 --> 01:42:13,179
Stupid blighter!

1348
01:42:13,264 --> 01:42:15,097
Good man.

1349
01:42:15,141 --> 01:42:20,396
But, as you can imagine, that
didn't sit too well with the captain.

1350
01:42:20,479 --> 01:42:23,733
That didn't sit too well
with the captain at all!

1351
01:42:23,817 --> 01:42:27,444
- Tell him what Barbossa did.
- I'm telling the story!

1352
01:42:29,989 --> 01:42:34,074
So... what the captain did...

1353
01:42:34,159 --> 01:42:36,745
...he strapped a cannon
to Bootstrap's bootstraps.

1354
01:42:36,829 --> 01:42:38,330
Bootstrap's bootstraps.

1355
01:42:38,373 --> 01:42:41,375
Last we saw of ol' Bill Turner...

1356
01:42:41,460 --> 01:42:43,918
...he was sinking to
the crushin' black oblivion

1357
01:42:44,003 --> 01:42:47,131
of Davy Jones' locker!

1358
01:42:47,550 --> 01:42:50,633
'Course it was only after that
we learned we needed his blood

1359
01:42:50,676 --> 01:42:51,885
to lift the curse.

1360
01:42:51,969 --> 01:42:55,014
That's what you'd call ironic.

1361
01:42:59,185 --> 01:43:00,811
Bring him!

1362
01:43:08,026 --> 01:43:10,029
I don't care for the situation.

1363
01:43:10,572 --> 01:43:13,656
Any attempt to storm the caves
could turn into an ambush.

1364
01:43:13,699 --> 01:43:17,036
Not if you're the one
doing the ambushing.

1365
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:20,788
I go in and convince Barbossa to send
his men out in their little boats.

1366
01:43:20,872 --> 01:43:23,708
You and your men
return to the Dauntless

1367
01:43:23,751 --> 01:43:27,004
and blast the bejesus out of them
with your little cannons.

1368
01:43:27,047 --> 01:43:28,296
What do you have to lose?

1369
01:43:29,382 --> 01:43:31,885
Nothing I'd lament being rid of.

1370
01:43:33,552 --> 01:43:35,428
Now, to be quite honest with you,

1371
01:43:35,513 --> 01:43:38,474
there's still a slight risk
to those aboard the Dauntless,

1372
01:43:38,558 --> 01:43:42,352
which includes
the future Mrs. Commodore.

1373
01:43:42,394 --> 01:43:45,480
- It's for your safety!
- Don't care what the Commodore ordered!

1374
01:43:45,565 --> 01:43:46,564
I have to tell him!

1375
01:43:46,607 --> 01:43:49,609
The pirates! They're cursed!
They can't be killed!

1376
01:43:49,693 --> 01:43:52,237
Don't worry, miss.
He's already informed of that.

1377
01:43:52,279 --> 01:43:55,989
A little mermaid flopped up on deck
and told him the whole story!

1378
01:43:56,074 --> 01:43:58,158
This is Jack Sparrow's doing!

1379
01:44:09,631 --> 01:44:11,089
No reason to fret.

1380
01:44:11,173 --> 01:44:13,758
Just a prick of the finger,
a few drops of blood...

1381
01:44:13,801 --> 01:44:15,802
No mistakes this time.

1382
01:44:15,886 --> 01:44:17,595
He's only half Turner.

1383
01:44:17,680 --> 01:44:19,097
We spill it all!

1384
01:44:21,516 --> 01:44:24,435
Guess there is reason to fret.

1385
01:44:37,282 --> 01:44:39,159
Beg your pardon, mate.
Beg your pardon.

1386
01:44:39,244 --> 01:44:41,286
- Begun by blood...
- Excuse me.

1387
01:44:41,370 --> 01:44:44,080
By blood un...

1388
01:44:46,458 --> 01:44:47,457
Jack!

1389
01:44:48,502 --> 01:44:49,584
It's not possible!

1390
01:44:49,626 --> 01:44:51,796
Not probable.

1391
01:44:51,839 --> 01:44:53,632
Where's Elizabeth?

1392
01:44:55,009 --> 01:44:57,259
She's safe, just like I promised.

1393
01:44:57,302 --> 01:45:00,262
She's all set to marry Norrington,
just like she promised,

1394
01:45:00,305 --> 01:45:02,681
and you get to die for her,
just like you promised.

1395
01:45:02,765 --> 01:45:04,892
So we're all men of our word, really.

1396
01:45:04,976 --> 01:45:08,271
Except for Elizabeth,
who is, in fact, a woman.

1397
01:45:08,314 --> 01:45:09,731
Shut up! You're next!

1398
01:45:13,277 --> 01:45:16,154
You don't want to be doing that, mate.

1399
01:45:16,196 --> 01:45:18,155
No, I really think I do.

1400
01:45:19,949 --> 01:45:21,826
Your funeral.

1401
01:45:24,997 --> 01:45:26,997
And why don't I want to be doing it?

1402
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:28,708
Oh, because...

1403
01:45:29,709 --> 01:45:32,044
Because the HMS Dauntless,

1404
01:45:32,128 --> 01:45:34,546
the pride of the Royal Navy,

1405
01:45:34,631 --> 01:45:37,883
is floating just off shore,

1406
01:45:37,967 --> 01:45:39,801
waiting for you.

1407
01:45:47,853 --> 01:45:49,020
What we doing here?

1408
01:45:50,939 --> 01:45:54,358
The pirates come out,
unprepared and unawares.

1409
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:56,486
We catch 'em in a crossfire,

1410
01:45:56,528 --> 01:45:59,363
and send 'em down to see Old Hob.

1411
01:46:00,658 --> 01:46:03,034
I know why we're here. I meant...

1412
01:46:03,118 --> 01:46:04,993
...why aren't we doing what it was...

1413
01:46:05,036 --> 01:46:06,869
What Mr. Sparrow said we should do?

1414
01:46:06,912 --> 01:46:08,414
With the cannons and all?

1415
01:46:08,499 --> 01:46:11,541
Because it was Mr. Sparrow who said it.

1416
01:46:14,169 --> 01:46:16,755
You think he wasn't telling the truth?

1417
01:46:16,839 --> 01:46:18,716
Just hear me out, mate.

1418
01:46:18,801 --> 01:46:22,552
You order your men to row out to the
Dauntless, they do what they do best...

1419
01:46:23,639 --> 01:46:28,058
Robert's your uncle, Fanny's your aunt.
There you are with two ships.

1420
01:46:28,142 --> 01:46:30,560
The makings of your very own fleet.

1421
01:46:30,645 --> 01:46:34,232
'Course, you'll take the grandest
as your flagship, and who's to argue?

1422
01:46:34,316 --> 01:46:35,732
But what of the Pearl?

1423
01:46:37,359 --> 01:46:38,695
Name me captain.

1424
01:46:38,737 --> 01:46:42,196
I'll sail under your colors,
I'll give you ten percent of me plunder,

1425
01:46:42,239 --> 01:46:44,448
and you'll get to
introduce yourself as...

1426
01:46:45,033 --> 01:46:47,911
...Commodore Barbossa.

1427
01:46:47,954 --> 01:46:49,037
Savvy?

1428
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:51,289
I suppose, in exchange, you'll be

1429
01:46:51,373 --> 01:46:54,209
- wanting me not to kill the whelp.
- No. Not at all!

1430
01:46:54,252 --> 01:46:55,919
By all means, kill the whelp!

1431
01:46:55,962 --> 01:46:58,380
Just not yet.

1432
01:46:58,423 --> 01:47:00,591
Wait to lift the curse

1433
01:47:00,633 --> 01:47:03,301
until the opportune moment.

1434
01:47:06,764 --> 01:47:08,391
For instance...

1435
01:47:10,268 --> 01:47:13,520
...after you've killed Norrington's men.

1436
01:47:13,604 --> 01:47:15,188
Every...

1437
01:47:15,273 --> 01:47:16,940
...last...

1438
01:47:16,983 --> 01:47:18,443
...one.

1439
01:47:28,078 --> 01:47:30,412
You've been planning this
from the beginning!

1440
01:47:30,456 --> 01:47:32,039
Ever since you learned my name!

1441
01:47:32,874 --> 01:47:33,873
Yeah.

1442
01:47:36,208 --> 01:47:38,336
I want 50 percent of your plunder.

1443
01:47:38,422 --> 01:47:39,421
- 15!
- 40!

1444
01:47:39,464 --> 01:47:40,465
25!

1445
01:47:41,632 --> 01:47:42,966
And I'll buy you the hat.

1446
01:47:43,009 --> 01:47:45,010
A really big one.

1447
01:47:45,803 --> 01:47:46,971
Commodore.

1448
01:47:50,099 --> 01:47:51,307
We have an accord.

1449
01:47:52,978 --> 01:47:55,270
All hands to the boats!

1450
01:47:56,273 --> 01:47:57,397
Apologies.

1451
01:47:57,482 --> 01:47:59,149
You give the orders.

1452
01:48:00,486 --> 01:48:01,485
Gents...

1453
01:48:02,488 --> 01:48:03,861
...take a walk!

1454
01:48:08,700 --> 01:48:10,035
Not to the boats?

1455
01:49:09,429 --> 01:49:12,347
Hold fire!

1456
01:49:14,390 --> 01:49:17,184
This is just like what
the Greeks done at Troy!

1457
01:49:18,563 --> 01:49:20,188
'Cept they was in a horse,

1458
01:49:20,231 --> 01:49:21,690
instead of dresses.

1459
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:23,774
Wooden horse.

1460
01:49:36,746 --> 01:49:37,747
A moment, please.

1461
01:49:41,919 --> 01:49:42,917
Elizabeth?

1462
01:49:46,173 --> 01:49:47,965
I just want you to know, I...

1463
01:49:49,092 --> 01:49:51,552
I believe you made a very
good decision today.

1464
01:49:52,386 --> 01:49:54,389
Couldn't be more proud of you!

1465
01:49:54,891 --> 01:49:56,016
But, you know,

1466
01:49:56,100 --> 01:49:59,018
even a good decision,
if made for the wrong reasons,

1467
01:49:59,102 --> 01:50:00,604
can be a wrong decision.

1468
01:50:09,615 --> 01:50:10,613
Lieutenant.

1469
01:50:17,537 --> 01:50:19,955
Yoo-hoo.

1470
01:50:29,799 --> 01:50:30,967
Elizabeth?

1471
01:50:33,136 --> 01:50:34,386
Are you there?

1472
01:50:36,639 --> 01:50:39,266
Elizabeth, are you even listening to me?

1473
01:51:05,710 --> 01:51:08,463
Oh, what have you done?

1474
01:51:08,506 --> 01:51:12,091
- Yoo-hoo.
- Stop that! I already feel like a fool!

1475
01:51:13,134 --> 01:51:15,636
Look nice, though.

1476
01:51:19,015 --> 01:51:21,433
Do I look nice now?!

1477
01:51:57,387 --> 01:51:58,637
I must admit, Jack.

1478
01:51:58,722 --> 01:52:00,639
I thought I had you figured.

1479
01:52:00,724 --> 01:52:03,892
But it turns out you're
a hard man to predict.

1480
01:52:03,977 --> 01:52:05,935
Me, I'm dishonest.

1481
01:52:06,020 --> 01:52:08,857
And a dishonest man you can
always trust to be dishonest.

1482
01:52:08,899 --> 01:52:10,149
Honestly...

1483
01:52:10,233 --> 01:52:12,859
...it's the honest ones
you want to watch out for.

1484
01:52:12,901 --> 01:52:15,194
'Cause you can never predict

1485
01:52:15,237 --> 01:52:18,532
when they're going to do
something incredibly...

1486
01:52:18,575 --> 01:52:19,574
...stupid.

1487
01:52:37,217 --> 01:52:38,384
Ha-ha!

1488
01:52:38,427 --> 01:52:39,469
Ha-ha!

1489
01:52:39,553 --> 01:52:40,888
Ha!

1490
01:52:52,734 --> 01:52:54,942
You're off the edge of the map, mate.

1491
01:52:55,027 --> 01:52:57,070
Here, there be monsters!

1492
01:53:04,954 --> 01:53:07,037
What would you pick to eat first?

1493
01:53:07,121 --> 01:53:09,041
I think we should decide now,

1494
01:53:09,125 --> 01:53:11,293
just so we're ready when the time comes!

1495
01:53:36,362 --> 01:53:37,485
What was that?

1496
01:53:41,989 --> 01:53:43,033
Oh.

1497
01:53:55,713 --> 01:53:57,963
Shh!

1498
01:54:00,426 --> 01:54:01,426
It's Elizabeth!

1499
01:54:22,030 --> 01:54:23,699
Make for the ship! Move!

1500
01:54:27,871 --> 01:54:29,286
Ahh!

1501
01:54:33,125 --> 01:54:34,917
To the ship!

1502
01:54:37,714 --> 01:54:40,841
Marines, arms!

1503
01:55:17,294 --> 01:55:19,045
You can't beat me, Jack.

1504
01:55:43,319 --> 01:55:44,862
That's interesting!

1505
01:55:55,748 --> 01:55:57,624
I couldn't resist, mate.

1506
01:56:19,690 --> 01:56:21,941
Oh, no.

1507
01:57:04,025 --> 01:57:05,233
Sorry!

1508
01:57:14,328 --> 01:57:15,995
So, what now, Jack Sparrow?

1509
01:57:16,038 --> 01:57:18,706
Are we to be two immortals,
locked in an epic battle

1510
01:57:18,790 --> 01:57:21,124
until Judgment Day,
when the trumpets sound?

1511
01:57:21,208 --> 01:57:22,208
Hm?

1512
01:57:22,251 --> 01:57:23,669
Or you could surrender.

1513
01:57:32,429 --> 01:57:35,764
Ahh!

1514
01:57:35,848 --> 01:57:37,683
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha.

1515
01:57:50,988 --> 01:57:52,197
All of you with me!

1516
01:57:52,239 --> 01:57:54,324
Will is in that cave,
and we must save him!

1517
01:57:54,408 --> 01:57:56,993
Ready, and... heave!

1518
01:58:03,584 --> 01:58:05,585
Please, I need your help! Come on!

1519
01:58:05,670 --> 01:58:08,421
Any port in a storm.

1520
01:58:08,506 --> 01:58:10,591
Cotton's right. We've got the Pearl!

1521
01:58:10,675 --> 01:58:12,926
What about Jack?
Are you just gonna leave him?

1522
01:58:13,009 --> 01:58:14,803
Jack owes us a ship!

1523
01:58:14,886 --> 01:58:16,430
There's the code to consider.

1524
01:58:17,016 --> 01:58:18,139
The code?

1525
01:58:19,893 --> 01:58:22,351
You're pirates!
Hang the code

1526
01:58:22,435 --> 01:58:24,105
and hang the rules!

1527
01:58:24,147 --> 01:58:26,565
They're more like guidelines, anyway.

1528
01:58:30,361 --> 01:58:32,530
Bloody pirates!

1529
01:58:42,124 --> 01:58:43,872
- Oi!
- What?

1530
01:58:43,957 --> 01:58:46,126
Is it supposed to be doing that?

1531
01:58:46,210 --> 01:58:48,420
They're stealing our ship!

1532
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:50,546
Bloody pirates!

1533
01:58:52,634 --> 01:58:54,469
Boarders away!

1534
01:59:02,684 --> 01:59:04,685
Come on!

1535
01:59:29,879 --> 01:59:31,920
No! Me eye!

1536
01:59:33,007 --> 01:59:34,715
No!

1537
01:59:49,023 --> 01:59:50,564
Ha!

1538
01:59:51,858 --> 01:59:53,942
I'm gonna teach you the meaning of pain!

1539
01:59:54,027 --> 01:59:55,570
You like pain?

1540
01:59:57,406 --> 01:59:58,782
Try wearing a corset.

1541
02:00:09,167 --> 02:00:10,794
Whose side is Jack on?

1542
02:00:10,878 --> 02:00:13,923
At the moment?

1543
02:00:48,123 --> 02:00:49,998
No fair!

1544
02:01:14,023 --> 02:01:15,858
Ten years you carry that pistol,

1545
02:01:15,942 --> 02:01:18,277
and now you waste your shot!

1546
02:01:19,279 --> 02:01:22,239
He didn't waste it.

1547
02:01:46,890 --> 02:01:48,391
I feel...

1548
02:01:52,980 --> 02:01:54,272
...cold.

1549
02:02:24,385 --> 02:02:27,388
Oh... Ugh! Oh!

1550
02:02:56,541 --> 02:02:59,001
Parley?

1551
02:02:59,044 --> 02:03:00,922
The ship is ours, gentlemen.

1552
02:03:01,006 --> 02:03:03,383
Huzzah! Huzzah!

1553
02:03:12,183 --> 02:03:15,061
Huzzah!

1554
02:03:49,261 --> 02:03:51,596
We should return to the Dauntless.

1555
02:03:54,143 --> 02:03:57,769
Your fiancé will be wanting
to know you're safe.

1556
02:04:07,448 --> 02:04:10,741
If you were waiting for
the opportune moment...

1557
02:04:11,742 --> 02:04:13,076
...that was it.

1558
02:04:14,536 --> 02:04:16,705
Now if you'd be so kind,
I'd be much obliged

1559
02:04:16,789 --> 02:04:19,624
if you'd drop me off at my ship.

1560
02:04:24,213 --> 02:04:26,381
I'm sorry, Jack.

1561
02:04:28,301 --> 02:04:30,509
They done what's right by them.

1562
02:04:30,594 --> 02:04:32,346
Can't expect more than that.

1563
02:04:47,945 --> 02:04:49,278
Jack Sparrow!

1564
02:04:49,321 --> 02:04:53,408
- We have learned that you...
- Captain! Captain Jack Sparrow.

1565
02:04:54,118 --> 02:04:57,370
...For your willful commission
of crimes against the crown.

1566
02:04:57,454 --> 02:05:01,166
Said crimes being numerous in quantity,

1567
02:05:01,250 --> 02:05:02,792
and sinister in nature.

1568
02:05:03,461 --> 02:05:04,960
The most egregious of these

1569
02:05:05,003 --> 02:05:07,214
to be cited herewith:

1570
02:05:07,299 --> 02:05:11,050
- Piracy, smuggling...
- This is wrong.

1571
02:05:12,052 --> 02:05:15,054
Commodore Norrington
is bound by the law,

1572
02:05:15,138 --> 02:05:17,681
as are we all.

1573
02:05:17,724 --> 02:05:20,434
...Impersonating an officer
of the Spanish Royal Navy,

1574
02:05:20,519 --> 02:05:23,605
impersonating a cleric
of the Church of England...

1575
02:05:23,689 --> 02:05:24,813
Oh, yes!

1576
02:05:24,855 --> 02:05:26,857
Sailing under false colors,

1577
02:05:26,942 --> 02:05:31,153
arson, kidnapping, looting, poaching,

1578
02:05:31,197 --> 02:05:37,159
brigandage, pilfering,
depravity, depredation,

1579
02:05:37,202 --> 02:05:38,995
and general lawlessness.

1580
02:05:40,412 --> 02:05:42,082
And for these crimes,

1581
02:05:42,166 --> 02:05:44,708
you have been sentenced to be,
on this day,

1582
02:05:44,752 --> 02:05:48,505
hung by the neck, until dead.

1583
02:05:48,548 --> 02:05:50,841
May God have mercy on your soul.

1584
02:05:50,883 --> 02:05:52,424
Governor Swann.

1585
02:05:52,509 --> 02:05:54,428
Commodore.

1586
02:05:55,929 --> 02:05:56,929
Elizabeth.

1587
02:05:58,390 --> 02:06:01,226
I should've told you every day,
from the moment I met you.

1588
02:06:04,020 --> 02:06:05,563
I love you.

1589
02:06:20,120 --> 02:06:21,872
Oi, watch yourself!

1590
02:06:21,914 --> 02:06:23,039
Marines!

1591
02:06:23,082 --> 02:06:24,623
I can't breathe!

1592
02:06:26,419 --> 02:06:27,458
Elizabeth!

1593
02:06:30,547 --> 02:06:31,590
Move!

1594
02:06:32,465 --> 02:06:34,757
Goodness sake!

1595
02:06:42,475 --> 02:06:44,684
You men! With me!

1596
02:06:55,947 --> 02:06:57,114
Move!

1597
02:07:06,874 --> 02:07:08,459
Come on!

1598
02:07:18,554 --> 02:07:19,677
Come on, men!

1599
02:07:45,289 --> 02:07:49,290
I thought we might have to endure some
manner of ill-conceived escape attempt.

1600
02:07:50,126 --> 02:07:51,709
But not from you.

1601
02:07:51,794 --> 02:07:55,631
On our return to Port Royal,
I granted you clemency.

1602
02:07:55,674 --> 02:07:57,340
And this is how you thank me?

1603
02:07:57,383 --> 02:07:59,467
By throwing in your lot with him?

1604
02:07:59,510 --> 02:08:01,094
He's a pirate!

1605
02:08:01,179 --> 02:08:03,139
And a good man.

1606
02:08:03,931 --> 02:08:06,183
If all I've achieved here
is that the hangman

1607
02:08:06,226 --> 02:08:08,352
will own two pairs
of boots instead of one,

1608
02:08:08,436 --> 02:08:10,062
so be it.

1609
02:08:10,146 --> 02:08:12,022
At least my conscience will be clear.

1610
02:08:12,065 --> 02:08:15,026
You forget your place, Turner.

1611
02:08:16,568 --> 02:08:18,195
It's right here,

1612
02:08:18,238 --> 02:08:19,697
between you and Jack.

1613
02:08:23,703 --> 02:08:25,369
As is mine.

1614
02:08:25,453 --> 02:08:26,828
Elizabeth!

1615
02:08:28,290 --> 02:08:29,454
Lower your weapons.

1616
02:08:30,250 --> 02:08:32,250
For goodness sake, put them down!

1617
02:08:37,341 --> 02:08:40,260
So this is where
your heart truly lies, then.

1618
02:08:41,885 --> 02:08:43,387
It is.

1619
02:08:51,894 --> 02:08:55,524
Well! I'm actually feeling
rather good about this.

1620
02:08:55,567 --> 02:08:58,109
I think we've all arrived
at a very special place, eh?

1621
02:08:58,193 --> 02:08:59,486
- Oh.
- Spiritually.

1622
02:08:59,570 --> 02:09:01,571
Ecumenically.

1623
02:09:01,656 --> 02:09:03,740
Grammatically.

1624
02:09:04,324 --> 02:09:06,908
I want you to know that
I was rooting for you, mate.

1625
02:09:08,204 --> 02:09:09,204
Know that.

1626
02:09:13,209 --> 02:09:14,710
Elizabeth.

1627
02:09:16,670 --> 02:09:19,255
It would never have worked
between us, darling.

1628
02:09:20,716 --> 02:09:22,593
I'm sorry.

1629
02:09:24,721 --> 02:09:25,721
Will!

1630
02:09:28,016 --> 02:09:29,683
Nice hat.

1631
02:09:31,644 --> 02:09:33,227
Friends!

1632
02:09:35,147 --> 02:09:37,941
This the day that you will always

1633
02:09:37,984 --> 02:09:40,611
remember as the day that...

1634
02:09:45,575 --> 02:09:48,242
Idiot! He's nowhere to go
but back to the noose!

1635
02:09:50,663 --> 02:09:52,498
Sail ho!

1636
02:10:00,049 --> 02:10:02,675
What's your plan of action?

1637
02:10:03,425 --> 02:10:04,425
Sir?

1638
02:10:08,807 --> 02:10:11,264
Perhaps on the rare occasion

1639
02:10:11,307 --> 02:10:15,187
pursuing the right course
demands an act of piracy,

1640
02:10:15,271 --> 02:10:19,066
piracy itself can be the right course?

1641
02:10:23,320 --> 02:10:24,613
Mr. Turner!

1642
02:10:30,703 --> 02:10:33,538
I will accept the consequences
of my actions.

1643
02:10:39,503 --> 02:10:41,129
This is a beautiful sword.

1644
02:10:43,590 --> 02:10:45,341
I would expect the man who made it

1645
02:10:45,384 --> 02:10:50,180
to show the same care and devotion
in every aspect of his life.

1646
02:10:52,224 --> 02:10:53,976
Thank you.

1647
02:10:56,854 --> 02:10:57,894
Commodore!

1648
02:10:57,979 --> 02:10:59,690
What about Sparrow?

1649
02:11:01,607 --> 02:11:04,526
Oh, I think we can afford
to give him one day's head start.

1650
02:11:11,033 --> 02:11:12,703
So...

1651
02:11:13,786 --> 02:11:16,873
This is the path you've chosen, is it?

1652
02:11:18,249 --> 02:11:20,541
After all...

1653
02:11:20,584 --> 02:11:22,129
...he is a blacksmith.

1654
02:11:23,130 --> 02:11:24,381
No.

1655
02:11:29,094 --> 02:11:31,388
He's a pirate.

1656
02:11:56,412 --> 02:11:58,079
Heave!

1657
02:12:07,632 --> 02:12:10,217
Thought you were supposed
to keep to the code, eh?

1658
02:12:10,259 --> 02:12:12,928
We figured they were more actual...

1659
02:12:13,012 --> 02:12:14,972
...guidelines.

1660
02:12:19,102 --> 02:12:20,811
Thank you.

1661
02:12:21,938 --> 02:12:23,314
Captain Sparrow.

1662
02:12:27,610 --> 02:12:29,194
The Black Pearl is yours!

1663
02:12:45,002 --> 02:12:46,629
On deck, you scabrous dogs!

1664
02:12:46,713 --> 02:12:48,381
Hands to braces!

1665
02:12:48,465 --> 02:12:50,549
Let go and haul to run free.

1666
02:12:52,219 --> 02:12:54,011
Now...

1667
02:12:54,096 --> 02:12:55,930
Bring me that horizon.

1668
02:13:03,228 --> 02:13:05,314
♪ ...And really bad eggs

1669
02:13:08,652 --> 02:13:11,153
♪ Drink up, me hearties
Yo ho ♪
