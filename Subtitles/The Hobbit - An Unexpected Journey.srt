My dear Frodo:

there was to know about my adventures.

30
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:18,405

...running like rivers through stone.

32
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:27,748

Thror named it "The King's Jewel."

40
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:04,326
He took it as a sign,
a sign that his right to rule was divine.

41

All would pay homage to him.

Smaug owes allegiance to no one.

But if he should side with the enemy...

1281
01:35:51,287 --> 01:35:54,205
...a dragon could be used
to terrible effect.

1291

beyond the evil of Smaug.

Something far more powerful.

be ignoring us, that I can promise you.

1298
01:36:48,677 --> 01:36:51,513
A sickness lies over the Greenwood.

call it Mirkwood.

Well? Don't stop now.

Tell us what the woodsmen say.

1303
01:37:03,818 --> 01:37:07,111
They speak of a Necromancer
living in Dol Guldur.

1304
01:37:07,279 --> 01:37:10,740
A sorcerer who can summon the dead.

1305

No such power exists in this world.

1307

This Necromancer is nothing more
than a mortal man.

1308
01:37:19,917 --> 01:37:22,418

Well, he's odd, I grant you.
He lives a solitary life.

1314
01:37:37,935 --> 01:37:42,313
It's not that. It's his excessive
consumption of mushrooms.

and yellowed his teeth.

Haven't seen the back of us yet

1927
02:41:24,966 --> 02:41:28,260
We'll fight as long as we live

1928
02:41:28,970 --> 02:41:32,181
All eyes on the hidden door

1929
02:41:32,891 --> 02:41:36,268
To the Lonely Mountain borne

1930
02:41:37,020 --> 02:41:40,231
We'll ride in the gathering storm

1931
02:41:40,816 --> 02:41:45,903
Until we get our long-forgotten gold

1932
02:41:47,823 --> 02:41:53,661
We lay under the misty mountains cold

1933
02:41:55,539 --> 02:41:58,040
ln slumbers deep

1934
02:41:59,209 --> 02:42:01,669
And dreams of gold

1935
02:42:03,505 --> 02:42:06,716
We must awake

1936
02:42:07,592 --> 02:42:10,594
Our lives to make

1937
02:42:11,596 --> 02:42:16,642
And in the darkness a torch we hold

1938
02:42:18,687 --> 02:42:24,024
From long ago when lanterns burned

1939
02:42:25,694 --> 02:42:28,696
Until this day

1940
02:42:29,740 --> 02:42:32,032
Our hearts have yearned

1941
02:42:33,744 --> 02:42:36,537
Her fate unknown

1942
02:42:37,873 --> 02:42:41,125
The Arkenstone

1943
02:42:42,002 --> 02:42:44,462
What was stolen

1944
02:42:45,839 --> 02:42:48,090
Must be returned

1945
02:43:04,024 --> 02:43:07,735
We must awake

1946
02:43:07,986 --> 02:43:11,739
And make the day

1947
02:43:12,032 --> 02:43:17,995
To find a song for heart and soul

1948
02:43:21,708 --> 02:43:24,960
Some folk we never forget

1949
02:43:25,754 --> 02:43:29,006
Some kind we never forgive

1950
02:43:29,925 --> 02:43:33,010
Haven't seen the end of it yet

1951
02:43:34,054 --> 02:43:37,181
We'll fight as long as we live

1952
02:43:37,974 --> 02:43:41,352
All eyes on the hidden door

1953
02:43:42,020 --> 02:43:45,439
To the Lonely Mountain borne

1954
02:43:46,107 --> 02:43:49,318
We'll ride in the gathering storm

1955
02:43:50,111 --> 02:43:54,907
Till we get our long-forgotten gold

1956
02:43:56,576 --> 02:44:04,041
Far away from misty mountains cold

1957
02:49:32,287 --> 02:49:34,288
