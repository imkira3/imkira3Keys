File 82-712.

4
00:00:55,106 --> 00:00:57,273
Agent Rick Dicker
interrogating.

5
00:00:57,275 --> 00:00:58,644
State your name, please.

6
00:01:01,713 --> 00:01:04,650
Uh, Tony. Tony Rydinger.

7
00:01:07,686 --> 00:01:09,285
Tell me about the incident.

8
00:01:09,287 --> 00:01:12,522
Well, there's this girl,
um, in my class.

9
00:01:12,524 --> 00:01:14,156
<i>I saw her at the track meet.</i>

10
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:16,793
- You're, uh, Violet, right?
- That's me.

11
00:01:16,795 --> 00:01:18,828
<i>I sort of knew her,
but she'd changed.</i>

12
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,163
<i>Relaxed.
She was more sure of herself.</i>

13
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:22,431
<i>Cool, cute.</i>

14
00:01:22,433 --> 00:01:23,767
<i>I asked her out to a movie.</i>

15
00:01:23,769 --> 00:01:24,834
So, Friday?

16
00:01:24,836 --> 00:01:26,435
- Friday.
- Friday.

17
00:01:26,437 --> 00:01:27,804
<i>And I went to watch
the track meet.</i>

18
00:01:27,806 --> 00:01:31,608
<i>Not long after, this thing
happened in the parking lot.</i>

19
00:01:46,324 --> 00:01:48,525
Behold! The Underminer!

20
00:01:48,527 --> 00:01:53,362
I am always beneath you,
but nothing is beneath me!

21
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:55,197
<i>As if things aren't
weird enough,</i>

22
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:56,733
<i>I look over
and I see these boots.</i>

23
00:01:56,735 --> 00:01:58,300
You two, stay here.

24
00:01:58,302 --> 00:01:59,769
Wait.
Should we be doing this?

25
00:01:59,771 --> 00:02:01,337
It is still illegal.

26
00:02:01,339 --> 00:02:02,606
<i>They looked
like superheroes.</i>

27
00:02:02,608 --> 00:02:04,373
- We're gonna lose him.
- Oh, all right.

28
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:05,575
One of you patrol
the perimeter,

29
00:02:05,577 --> 00:02:06,843
keep the crowds
back and safe.

30
00:02:06,845 --> 00:02:08,410
The other,
watch after Jack-Jack.

31
00:02:08,412 --> 00:02:09,311
But I thought we were
gonna go with...

32
00:02:09,313 --> 00:02:10,346
You heard your mother.

33
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:12,216
Trampoline me.

34
00:02:16,955 --> 00:02:18,354
I call perimeter!

35
00:02:18,356 --> 00:02:19,455
You're not
going anywhere,

36
00:02:19,457 --> 00:02:20,890
you little
maggoty creep!

37
00:02:20,892 --> 00:02:22,726
<i>I see my chance
to get out of there.</i>

38
00:02:22,728 --> 00:02:26,261
<i>But there's something familiar
about one of the kids' voices.</i>

39
00:02:26,263 --> 00:02:27,797
<i>The girl, she's upset</i>

40
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:29,666
<i>and she throws down
her mask...</i>

41
00:02:29,668 --> 00:02:31,233
<i>and it's her!</i>

42
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:32,702
Oh. Tony!

43
00:02:32,704 --> 00:02:33,703
Hi.

44
00:02:33,705 --> 00:02:35,639
Uh, this isn't
what you think it is.

45
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:37,373
<i>It was just getting
too freaky.</i>

46
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:39,408
<i>I couldn't handle it
and ran off.</i>

47
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,810
I feel kinda bad about it.

48
00:02:40,812 --> 00:02:43,680
Maybe I should've said
"hi" or something?

49
00:02:43,682 --> 00:02:45,782
It's not her fault
superheroes are illegal.

50
00:02:45,784 --> 00:02:47,784
And it's not like
I don't like strong girls.

51
00:02:47,786 --> 00:02:50,352
I'm pretty secure
manhood-wise.

52
00:02:50,354 --> 00:02:51,688
What is that?

53
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,423
Have you told anyone else
about this? Your parents?

54
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:56,392
No, they'd only think
I was hiding something.

55
00:02:56,394 --> 00:02:58,662
- You know what I mean?
- Sure, kid.

56
00:02:58,664 --> 00:03:00,396
I like this girl, Mr. Dicker.

57
00:03:00,398 --> 00:03:02,398
I'm supposed to go out
with her Friday night.

58
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,802
Now, things are just
gonna be weird.

59
00:03:05,804 --> 00:03:08,470
I wish I could forget
I ever saw her in that suit.

60
00:03:08,472 --> 00:03:09,875
You will, kid.

61
00:03:10,676 --> 00:03:12,511
You will.

62
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,422
Come on!

63
00:03:44,408 --> 00:03:48,011
Consider yourself undermined!

64
00:03:59,991 --> 00:04:02,694
Ooh.

65
00:04:11,636 --> 00:04:14,003
- Underminer!
- We meet again... Huh?

66
00:04:18,744 --> 00:04:21,880
Oh, great!
Now, he's on the agenda.

67
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:38,962
Incredible!

68
00:04:38,964 --> 00:04:40,462
Meet Jack Hammer!

69
00:04:50,075 --> 00:04:51,843
Buh-bye!

70
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:10,093
No, no, no! No, no, no!

71
00:05:14,633 --> 00:05:17,903
Everybody, stay back!
Okay? Stay back!

72
00:05:19,704 --> 00:05:22,507
You're not sticking me
with babysitting!

73
00:05:26,144 --> 00:05:30,379
I can't steer it or stop it.
And the Underminer's escaped!

74
00:05:30,381 --> 00:05:32,483
We'll have to stop it...
Bob! The monorail!

75
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:41,560
Frozone! Yeah!

76
00:05:46,097 --> 00:05:47,462
We have to stop
this thing

77
00:05:47,464 --> 00:05:48,698
before it gets
to the overpass!

78
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,034
I'll try to keep it away
from the buildings!

79
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:02,848
Hey, lady!

80
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:06,182
Thank you so much,
young man!

81
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:13,658
What?

82
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,459
Violet!

83
00:06:18,163 --> 00:06:20,532
Ahh!

84
00:06:29,174 --> 00:06:31,174
Stop!

85
00:06:31,176 --> 00:06:33,078
Everybody, stop!

86
00:07:02,641 --> 00:07:04,643
- Heads up, Dad!
- Dash!

87
00:07:06,711 --> 00:07:09,478
Violet!
Who's watching Jack-Jack?

88
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,980
Dash is watching him!

89
00:07:10,982 --> 00:07:12,982
Violet, here, you take him!

90
00:07:22,494 --> 00:07:23,826
It's headed for City Hall!

91
00:07:23,828 --> 00:07:26,865
Mom needs help!

92
00:07:31,202 --> 00:07:33,770
They're out in public again!
This is our chance!

93
00:07:33,772 --> 00:07:35,941
Follow them,
follow Frozone!

94
00:07:49,721 --> 00:07:52,824
Bob! Help me
with the boiler!

95
00:08:09,207 --> 00:08:10,807
That should do it!

96
00:08:10,809 --> 00:08:12,809
What are you kids doing?
Get out of here!

97
00:08:12,811 --> 00:08:14,210
This thing's gonna blow!

98
00:08:14,212 --> 00:08:15,914
There's no time!

99
00:08:27,726 --> 00:08:29,726
We did it!

100
00:08:29,728 --> 00:08:31,160
Freeze, Supers!

101
00:08:31,162 --> 00:08:33,732
Oh, what did we do?

102
00:08:37,602 --> 00:08:40,138
Excuse me, Mr. Zone?

103
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,208
Sorry, but I'm not
really supposed to be here.

104
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,110
Which seems wrong...

105
00:08:47,112 --> 00:08:48,211
doesn't it?

106
00:08:48,213 --> 00:08:52,050
Perhaps you'd be interested
in changing that law?

107
00:08:53,585 --> 00:08:55,184
<i>Superheroes including Frozone,</i>

108
00:08:55,186 --> 00:08:57,053
<i>Mr. Incredible,
and Elastigirl...</i>

109
00:08:57,055 --> 00:08:59,222
<i>caused further damage
to the city.</i>

110
00:08:59,224 --> 00:09:01,724
<i>The Underminer
remains at large.</i>

111
00:09:01,726 --> 00:09:03,593
We didn't start
this fight.

112
00:09:03,595 --> 00:09:04,994
Well, you didn't
finish it either!

113
00:09:04,996 --> 00:09:07,130
Did you stop the Underminer
from inflicting more damage?

114
00:09:07,132 --> 00:09:08,064
No.

115
00:09:08,066 --> 00:09:09,699
Did you stop him
from robbing the banks?

116
00:09:09,701 --> 00:09:11,167
- No.
- Did you catch him?

117
00:09:11,169 --> 00:09:13,669
- No.
- The banks were insured.

118
00:09:13,671 --> 00:09:14,937
We have infrastructure
in place

119
00:09:14,939 --> 00:09:16,172
to deal
with these matters.

120
00:09:16,174 --> 00:09:17,974
If you had simply
done nothing...

121
00:09:17,976 --> 00:09:19,642
everything would now be

122
00:09:19,644 --> 00:09:20,943
proceeding
in an orderly fashion.

123
00:09:20,945 --> 00:09:23,379
You'd have preferred
we do nothing?

124
00:09:23,381 --> 00:09:25,083
Without a doubt.

125
00:09:29,254 --> 00:09:30,787
You weren't much help.

126
00:09:30,789 --> 00:09:32,822
Do you want
out of the hole?

127
00:09:32,824 --> 00:09:35,994
First you gotta
put down the shovel.

128
00:09:38,763 --> 00:09:40,932
Well, that went poorly.

129
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,800
Dad, this is probably

130
00:09:43,802 --> 00:09:47,070
not the best time
to tell you about this...

131
00:09:47,072 --> 00:09:50,141
but something else
happened today with a kid...

132
00:09:51,109 --> 00:09:53,044
and my mask.

133
00:10:06,357 --> 00:10:07,857
Oh, hey, Rick.

134
00:10:07,859 --> 00:10:10,226
Violet thinks a friend
of hers, a kid named Tony...

135
00:10:10,228 --> 00:10:13,196
might have seen her in the
outfit, without her mask.

136
00:10:13,198 --> 00:10:15,364
- Talkative type?
- Don't know.

137
00:10:15,366 --> 00:10:16,833
Last name is Rydinger.

138
00:10:16,835 --> 00:10:19,168
Tony Rydinger.

139
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,837
I'll check it out.

140
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:22,338
Bob, Helen...

141
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,974
a word
if you don't mind.

142
00:10:24,976 --> 00:10:27,977
Uh, the program's been
shut down.

143
00:10:27,979 --> 00:10:29,412
What?

144
00:10:29,414 --> 00:10:31,114
Politicians don't
understand people...

145
00:10:31,116 --> 00:10:34,450
who do good simply
because it's right.

146
00:10:34,452 --> 00:10:36,152
It makes 'em nervous.

147
00:10:36,154 --> 00:10:38,988
They've been gunning
for Supers for years.

148
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,390
Today was all they needed.

149
00:10:41,392 --> 00:10:43,292
Anyway...

150
00:10:43,294 --> 00:10:44,861
I'm done.

151
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,829
I'm afraid two more
weeks in the motel

152
00:10:46,831 --> 00:10:48,264
is the best
I can do for ya.

153
00:10:48,266 --> 00:10:49,398
It ain't much.

154
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,733
You've done plenty, Rick.

155
00:10:50,735 --> 00:10:52,235
We won't forget.

156
00:10:52,237 --> 00:10:54,470
Well, it has been
a great honor

157
00:10:54,472 --> 00:10:56,005
working with
you good people.

158
00:10:56,007 --> 00:10:58,474
Thanks for everything,
and good luck.

159
00:10:58,476 --> 00:11:01,012
Yeah. You, too.

160
00:11:15,226 --> 00:11:17,095
Did you wash your hands?

161
00:11:18,229 --> 00:11:20,965
With soap?

162
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:24,335
Did you dry them?

163
00:11:28,173 --> 00:11:32,875
What? Is this all vegetables?
Who ordered all vegetables?

164
00:11:32,877 --> 00:11:35,044
I did. They're good and
you're going to have some.

165
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,915
Are we going to
talk about it?

166
00:11:38,917 --> 00:11:41,150
- What?
- The elephant in the room.

167
00:11:41,152 --> 00:11:43,786
- What elephant?
- I guess not then.

168
00:11:43,788 --> 00:11:44,987
You're referring
to today.

169
00:11:44,989 --> 00:11:46,789
Yeah, what's the deal
with today?

170
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,191
We all made mistakes.

171
00:11:48,193 --> 00:11:49,158
For example,

172
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,194
you kids were supposed
to watch Jack-Jack.

173
00:11:51,196 --> 00:11:54,430
Babysitting, while you guys
did the important stuff.

174
00:11:54,432 --> 00:11:56,199
We talked about this.

175
00:11:56,201 --> 00:11:57,466
You're not old enough to
decide about these things.

176
00:11:57,468 --> 00:11:58,834
We are old enough
to help out.

177
00:11:58,836 --> 00:11:59,936
Yeah!

178
00:11:59,938 --> 00:12:01,538
Isn't that what
you tell us, Dad?

179
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,974
Yeah, well, "help out" can
mean many different things.

180
00:12:04,976 --> 00:12:06,776
But we're supposed to help,
if there's trouble.

181
00:12:06,778 --> 00:12:08,144
- Well, yeah, but...
- Aren't you

182
00:12:08,146 --> 00:12:09,845
- glad we helped today?
- Yeah, I know but...

183
00:12:09,847 --> 00:12:10,947
You said that you were
proud of us.

184
00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:12,848
Well, yeah, I was. Am!

185
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,217
We wanna fight
bad guys!

186
00:12:14,219 --> 00:12:17,253
No, you don't!

187
00:12:17,255 --> 00:12:19,288
You said things
were different now.

188
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:21,857
And they were,
on the island.

189
00:12:21,859 --> 00:12:23,459
But I didn't mean
that from now on...

190
00:12:23,461 --> 00:12:26,229
So now, we've gotta go back
to never using our powers.

191
00:12:26,231 --> 00:12:27,531
It defines who I am.

192
00:12:27,533 --> 00:12:29,198
We're not saying
you have...

193
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,367
- What?
- Someone on TV said it.

194
00:12:31,369 --> 00:12:32,969
Can we just eat?

195
00:12:32,971 --> 00:12:35,838
The dinner, while it's hot?

196
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,406
Did we do
something wrong?

197
00:12:37,408 --> 00:12:38,908
- Yes.
- No.

198
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:41,177
We didn't do
anything wrong.

199
00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:43,412
Superheroes are illegal.

200
00:12:43,414 --> 00:12:45,381
Whether it's fair or not,
that's the law.

201
00:12:45,383 --> 00:12:48,518
The law should be fair. What
are we teaching our kids?

202
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,852
To respect the law!

203
00:12:49,854 --> 00:12:51,254
Even when the law
is disrespectful?

204
00:12:51,256 --> 00:12:54,090
If laws are unjust, there
are laws to change them!

205
00:12:54,092 --> 00:12:55,258
Otherwise, it's chaos!

206
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,362
Which is exactly
what we have!

207
00:13:03,368 --> 00:13:05,368
I just thought
it was kinda cool.

208
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:09,405
- What was?
- Fighting crime as a family.

209
00:13:09,407 --> 00:13:12,542
It was cool.

210
00:13:12,544 --> 00:13:15,579
But it's over.
The world is what it is.

211
00:13:15,581 --> 00:13:17,880
We have to adapt.

212
00:13:17,882 --> 00:13:19,549
Are things bad?

213
00:13:19,551 --> 00:13:21,185
Things are fine.

214
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,489
May I be excused?

215
00:13:27,626 --> 00:13:30,627
How much longer
in the motel, Dad?

216
00:13:30,629 --> 00:13:33,464
- Uh...
- Not much longer, honey.

217
00:13:40,872 --> 00:13:41,971
What are we
gonna do?

218
00:13:41,973 --> 00:13:43,873
I don't know.

219
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,374
Maybe Dicker
will find something?

220
00:13:45,376 --> 00:13:46,510
Dicker is done, Bob.

221
00:13:46,512 --> 00:13:50,046
Any thought we had about being
Supers again is fantasy.

222
00:13:50,048 --> 00:13:51,648
One of us
has gotta get a job.

223
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,049
One of us?

224
00:13:53,051 --> 00:13:55,117
You did a long stint
at Insuricare.

225
00:13:55,119 --> 00:13:56,952
Hated every minute of it.

226
00:13:56,954 --> 00:13:58,488
I know
it was hard on you.

227
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:00,323
Maybe it's my turn
in the private sector

228
00:14:00,325 --> 00:14:01,957
and you take care
of the kids...

229
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:05,461
No, I'm doing this.
I need to do this.

230
00:14:05,463 --> 00:14:07,597
You know where my suit
and ties are?

231
00:14:07,599 --> 00:14:09,031
Burned up when...

232
00:14:09,033 --> 00:14:10,966
The jet destroyed
our house.

233
00:14:10,968 --> 00:14:12,335
Yeah.

234
00:14:12,337 --> 00:14:15,071
We can't count
on anyone else now, Bob.

235
00:14:15,073 --> 00:14:16,339
It's just us.

236
00:14:16,341 --> 00:14:17,781
We can't wait for...

237
00:14:26,284 --> 00:14:28,552
No lifeguard on duty!

238
00:14:28,554 --> 00:14:30,152
Swim at your own risk.

239
00:14:30,154 --> 00:14:31,488
Oh, where'd you go today?

240
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,657
I noticed
you missed all the fun.

241
00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:36,493
Don't be mad because
I know when to leave a party.

242
00:14:36,495 --> 00:14:38,194
I'm just as illegal
as you guys.

243
00:14:38,196 --> 00:14:40,996
Besides, I knew the cops
would let you go.

244
00:14:40,998 --> 00:14:42,599
Yeah, in spite
of Bob's best efforts.

245
00:14:42,601 --> 00:14:44,233
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

246
00:14:44,235 --> 00:14:47,103
I heard
the program shut down.

247
00:14:47,105 --> 00:14:49,004
How much longer
are you in this motel?

248
00:14:49,006 --> 00:14:50,272
Two weeks.

249
00:14:50,274 --> 00:14:52,074
Now, you know
the offer still stands.

250
00:14:52,076 --> 00:14:54,310
You're very generous,
but there are five of us.

251
00:14:54,312 --> 00:14:56,112
We wouldn't do that
to you and Honey.

252
00:14:56,114 --> 00:14:57,514
Well, door's always open.

253
00:14:57,516 --> 00:15:00,082
You know,
the news isn't all bad.

254
00:15:00,084 --> 00:15:02,619
While you guys
were being detained...

255
00:15:02,621 --> 00:15:06,455
I was approached by a dude
who represents this tycoon.

256
00:15:06,457 --> 00:15:08,525
- Winston Deavor.
- Wants to talk...

257
00:15:08,527 --> 00:15:12,261
with me, with you two,
about hero stuff.

258
00:15:12,263 --> 00:15:13,497
I checked him out.

259
00:15:13,499 --> 00:15:14,430
He's legit.

260
00:15:14,432 --> 00:15:16,298
Trained under Dicker.
He wants to meet.

261
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,434
Ah, jeez!
More superhero trouble.

262
00:15:18,436 --> 00:15:20,469
We just came from
the police station, Lucius.

263
00:15:20,471 --> 00:15:24,340
- When?
- Tonight. I'm going there now.

264
00:15:24,342 --> 00:15:26,208
You enjoy,
I'm sitting this one out.

265
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:27,644
He wants
all three of us.

266
00:15:27,646 --> 00:15:31,414
Honey, let's just at least
hear what he has to say.

267
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:34,183
You got the address,
I'll meet you guys there.

268
00:15:34,185 --> 00:15:36,452
Go in our Supersuits?

269
00:15:36,454 --> 00:15:38,087
Yeah.

270
00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:40,356
Might wanna wear
the old Supersuits.

271
00:15:40,358 --> 00:15:43,428
Got a feeling
he's nostalgic.

272
00:15:46,998 --> 00:15:48,698
Where are you going?

273
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,367
The fresh air
is especially good tonight.

274
00:15:51,369 --> 00:15:52,636
If Jack-Jack
wakes up...

275
00:15:52,638 --> 00:15:54,372
I know the drill.

276
00:16:04,148 --> 00:16:07,584
Your security badges.
Please, this way.

277
00:16:07,586 --> 00:16:09,251
Hey, listen,
you're my biggest fan.

278
00:16:09,253 --> 00:16:10,352
Good to see you.

279
00:16:10,354 --> 00:16:13,324
I'm your biggest fan.
Shoot!

280
00:16:36,414 --> 00:16:40,049
I love superheroes!

281
00:16:40,051 --> 00:16:42,218
The powers, the costumes...

282
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,053
the mythic struggles.

283
00:16:44,055 --> 00:16:46,155
Winston Deavor.
You can call me Win.

284
00:16:46,157 --> 00:16:47,423
Genuine pleasure
to meet you.

285
00:16:47,425 --> 00:16:49,225
- Frozone!
- It's good to see you.

286
00:16:49,227 --> 00:16:50,560
- Elastigirl.
- Nice to meet you.

287
00:16:50,562 --> 00:16:52,729

Can't tell you what a thrill this is.
And this...

297
00:17:16,622 --> 00:17:20,757
Oh, hello there, superheroes.
I'm so sorry I'm late.

298
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:22,659
...is my tardy sister,
Evelyn.

299
00:17:22,661 --> 00:17:26,596
And I'm scolding myself so
you don't have to, Winston!

300
00:17:26,598 --> 00:17:28,130
Spectacular.

301
00:17:28,132 --> 00:17:30,199
My father was so proud

302
00:17:30,201 --> 00:17:33,335
that I was even remotely
connected to you guys.

303
00:17:33,337 --> 00:17:35,539
He used to call you
the last line of defense.

304
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,507
He was
your top supporter.

305
00:17:37,509 --> 00:17:40,142
He donated
to superhero causes.

306
00:17:40,144 --> 00:17:41,410
<i>He raised money</i>

307
00:17:41,412 --> 00:17:43,312
<i>for the Dynaguy statue
in Avery Park.</i>

308
00:17:43,314 --> 00:17:45,314
<i>He got to know
many Supers personally.</i>

309
00:17:45,316 --> 00:17:46,816
<i>Even installed a phone</i>

310
00:17:46,818 --> 00:17:50,185
<i>with direct lines
to Gazerbeam and Fironic...</i>

311
00:17:50,187 --> 00:17:51,588
<i>in case of emergencies.</i>

312
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,323
<i>He loved that,
showed it off to everyone.</i>

313
00:17:54,325 --> 00:17:55,559
He was heartbroken

314
00:17:55,561 --> 00:17:57,293
when you were all forced
to go underground.

315
00:17:57,295 --> 00:17:58,695
Father believed
the world

316
00:17:58,697 --> 00:18:00,699
would become more dangerous
without you.

317
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,302
He didn't know
how right he was.

318
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:06,636
<i>There was a break-in.</i>

319
00:18:08,439 --> 00:18:10,807
<i>My father called Gazerbeam.</i>

320
00:18:10,809 --> 00:18:12,441
<i>The direct line.</i>

321
00:18:12,443 --> 00:18:14,176
<i>No answer.</i>

322
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:16,846
<i>He called Fironic, no answer.</i>

323
00:18:16,848 --> 00:18:20,149
<i>Superheroes had just been
made illegal...</i>

324
00:18:20,151 --> 00:18:22,351
<i>The robbers discovered him
on the phone...</i>

325
00:18:22,353 --> 00:18:23,722
<i>and shot him.</i>

326
00:18:25,524 --> 00:18:27,624
So...

327
00:18:27,626 --> 00:18:28,892
It must've been hard.

328
00:18:28,894 --> 00:18:30,493
Especially for Mother.

329
00:18:30,495 --> 00:18:33,663
She died a few months later.
Heartbreak.

330
00:18:33,665 --> 00:18:36,533
If superheroes had not been
forced underground...

331
00:18:36,535 --> 00:18:37,801
it never would've happened.

332
00:18:37,803 --> 00:18:40,402
Or Dad could've taken
Mom to the safe room

333
00:18:40,404 --> 00:18:41,738
as soon as he knew
there was trouble.

334
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,272
I disagree strongly!

335
00:18:43,274 --> 00:18:45,409
But we're not going
into it right now.

336
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,409
The point is...

337
00:18:47,411 --> 00:18:49,311
nobody expected us

338
00:18:49,313 --> 00:18:51,748
to be able to actually
run Dad's company.

339
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,485
But with Evelyn as designer,
and myself as operator...

340
00:18:55,487 --> 00:18:57,954
uh, we threw ourselves
into building DEVTECH

341
00:18:57,956 --> 00:18:59,589
into what it is today.

342
00:18:59,591 --> 00:19:02,358
A world-class
telecommunications company.

343
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,760
Bigger than ever.

344
00:19:03,762 --> 00:19:06,863
Perfectly positioned to make
some wrong things right.

345
00:19:06,865 --> 00:19:08,632
Hence, this meeting.

346
00:19:08,634 --> 00:19:10,366
Let me
ask you something.

347
00:19:10,368 --> 00:19:12,201
What is the main reason

348
00:19:12,203 --> 00:19:13,770
you were all
forced underground?

349
00:19:13,772 --> 00:19:15,839
- Ignorance.
- Perception.

350
00:19:15,841 --> 00:19:18,374
Take today for example,
with the Underminer.

351
00:19:18,376 --> 00:19:19,809
Difficult situation.

352
00:19:19,811 --> 00:19:22,211
You were faced with a
lot of hard decisions.

353
00:19:22,213 --> 00:19:23,379
Oh, tell me about it.

354
00:19:23,381 --> 00:19:24,614
I can't.

355
00:19:24,616 --> 00:19:27,282
Because I didn't see it...

356
00:19:27,284 --> 00:19:28,885
neither did anyone else.

357
00:19:28,887 --> 00:19:31,286
So, when you fight bad
guys like today...

358
00:19:31,288 --> 00:19:33,923
people don't see the fight
or what led up to it.

359
00:19:33,925 --> 00:19:36,526
They see what politicians
tell them to see.

360
00:19:36,528 --> 00:19:39,428
They see destruction
and they see you.

361
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,830
So, if we wanna change

362
00:19:40,832 --> 00:19:43,633
people's perceptions
about superheroes...

363
00:19:43,635 --> 00:19:44,601
we need you

364
00:19:44,603 --> 00:19:46,970
to share your perceptions
with the world.

365
00:19:46,972 --> 00:19:49,271
- How do we do that?
- With cameras.

366
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:53,409
<i>We need you to share your
perceptions with the world.</i>

367
00:19:53,411 --> 00:19:54,644
<i>How do we do that?</i>

368
00:19:54,646 --> 00:19:56,846
We embed
tiny cameras, like those,

369
00:19:56,848 --> 00:19:58,280
into your Supersuits.

370
00:19:58,282 --> 00:19:59,481
Wow, so small.

371
00:19:59,483 --> 00:20:00,984
And the picture
is outstanding.

372
00:20:00,986 --> 00:20:02,752
Thanks!
Designed 'em myself.

373
00:20:02,754 --> 00:20:04,353
We've got
resources, lobbyists,

374
00:20:04,355 --> 00:20:05,689
worldwide connections...

375
00:20:05,691 --> 00:20:08,257
and very important,
insurance.

376
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:09,559
Insurance is key.

377
00:20:09,561 --> 00:20:11,961
All we need now are the
super-est superheroes.

378
00:20:11,963 --> 00:20:14,430
It needs you three.
Come on!

379
00:20:14,432 --> 00:20:17,801
Help me make all Supers
legal again.

380
00:20:17,803 --> 00:20:18,902
This sounds great!

381
00:20:18,904 --> 00:20:21,370
Let's get this going.
What's my first assignment?

382
00:20:21,372 --> 00:20:23,439
That enthusiasm is golden.

383
00:20:23,441 --> 00:20:25,709
Now hold on to it.
But for our first move...

384
00:20:25,711 --> 00:20:29,478
Well, Elastigirl
is our best play.

385
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,316
Better than me?

386
00:20:32,851 --> 00:20:34,517
I mean, she's good.

387
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:36,619
Really, a credit to her...

388
00:20:36,621 --> 00:20:39,489
You know. You know.

389
00:20:39,491 --> 00:20:40,790
With great respect...

390
00:20:40,792 --> 00:20:41,791
let's not test the whole

391
00:20:41,793 --> 00:20:43,693
"insurance-will-pay-
for-everything" idea...

392
00:20:43,695 --> 00:20:45,895
on the first go 'round, okay?

393
00:20:45,897 --> 00:20:49,599
Wait a minute. You're saying what?
I'm messy?

394
00:20:49,601 --> 00:20:51,634
Well, Evelyn did
a cost-benefit analysis...

395
00:20:51,636 --> 00:20:54,003
comparing all your last
five years of crime fighting

396
00:20:54,005 --> 00:20:55,705
before going underground.

397
00:20:55,707 --> 00:20:57,707
And Elastigirl's numbers
are self-explanatory.

398
00:20:57,709 --> 00:20:59,743
Well, it's not
a fair comparison!

399
00:20:59,745 --> 00:21:02,579
Heavyweight problems
need heavyweight solutions.

400
00:21:02,581 --> 00:21:04,346
Of course!
We're gonna solve

401
00:21:04,348 --> 00:21:06,415
all kinds
of problems together.

402
00:21:06,417 --> 00:21:10,822
After the perfect launch
with Elastigirl!

403
00:21:11,556 --> 00:21:13,990
So, what do you say?

404
00:21:13,992 --> 00:21:16,561
What do I say?

405
00:21:17,361 --> 00:21:19,562
I don't know.

406
00:21:19,564 --> 00:21:21,330
What do you mean,
you don't know?

407
00:21:21,332 --> 00:21:23,666
A few hours ago, you were
saying it was over...

408
00:21:23,668 --> 00:21:25,869
and being a superhero
was a fantasy.

409
00:21:25,871 --> 00:21:27,971
Now, you get the offer
of a lifetime

410
00:21:27,973 --> 00:21:29,639
and you don't know?

411
00:21:29,641 --> 00:21:32,809
It's not that simple, Bob.
I wanna protect the kids!

412
00:21:32,811 --> 00:21:34,376
So do I.

413
00:21:34,378 --> 00:21:35,912
From jail, Bob!

414
00:21:35,914 --> 00:21:37,479
And how do you do that?

415
00:21:37,481 --> 00:21:39,649
By turning down a chance
to change the law

416
00:21:39,651 --> 00:21:41,050
that forces them to hide
what they are?

417
00:21:41,052 --> 00:21:43,686
They haven't decided what they are.
They're still kids.

418
00:21:43,688 --> 00:21:46,022
Kids with powers,
which makes them Supers...

419
00:21:46,024 --> 00:21:48,658
whether they decide to
use those powers or not.

420
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,026
This will benefit them.

421
00:21:50,028 --> 00:21:51,828
It's not a good time
to be away.

422
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,596
Dash is having trouble
with homework...

423
00:21:53,598 --> 00:21:55,498
Vi is worried
about her first date

424
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,933
with that boy she likes,
Tony...

425
00:21:56,935 --> 00:21:57,734
and Jack-Jack...

426
00:21:57,736 --> 00:22:00,703
Jack-Jack?
What's wrong with him?

427
00:22:00,705 --> 00:22:02,005
Okay, nothing's wrong
with Jack-Jack.

428
00:22:02,007 --> 00:22:04,774
But even a normal baby
needs a lot of attention.

429
00:22:04,776 --> 00:22:06,609
I'm just not sure
I can leave.

430
00:22:06,611 --> 00:22:08,044
Of course you can leave.

431
00:22:08,046 --> 00:22:10,146
You've got to.
So that I...

432
00:22:10,148 --> 00:22:12,081
we can be Supers again,

433
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:13,883
so our kids can have
that choice.

434
00:22:13,885 --> 00:22:15,952
So you can have
that choice.

435
00:22:15,954 --> 00:22:17,153
All right, yes!

436
00:22:17,155 --> 00:22:19,722
So I can have
that choice.

437
00:22:19,724 --> 00:22:22,058
And I would do a great job!

438
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:26,830
Regardless of what Deavor's
pie charts say or whatever...

439
00:22:26,832 --> 00:22:28,798
But they want you.

440
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,670
And you'll do a great...

441
00:22:32,436 --> 00:22:33,772
job...

442
00:22:34,139 --> 00:22:36,940
too.

443
00:22:36,942 --> 00:22:39,976
Well, that
was excruciating to watch.

444
00:22:39,978 --> 00:22:42,011
I can't lie to you.

445
00:22:42,013 --> 00:22:45,480
It's nice to be wanted.
Flattering, you know, but...

446
00:22:45,482 --> 00:22:46,549
But what's the choice?

447
00:22:46,551 --> 00:22:47,851
One, do this right,

448
00:22:47,853 --> 00:22:49,451
get well paid,
we're out of the motel...

449
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:51,054
and things get better
for all Supers,

450
00:22:51,056 --> 00:22:52,454
including our kids.

451
00:22:52,456 --> 00:22:53,923
Or two...

452
00:22:53,925 --> 00:22:57,459
I find a job in two weeks
or we're homeless.

453
00:22:57,461 --> 00:22:58,928
You know
it's crazy, right?

454
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:01,463
To help my family,
I gotta leave it.

455
00:23:01,465 --> 00:23:02,565
To fix the law,
I gotta break it.

456
00:23:02,567 --> 00:23:03,666
You'll be great.

457
00:23:03,668 --> 00:23:04,834
I know I will.

458
00:23:04,836 --> 00:23:05,902
But what about you?
We have kids.

459
00:23:05,904 --> 00:23:07,704
I'll watch the kids,
no problem.

460
00:23:07,706 --> 00:23:09,471
- Easy.
- Easy, huh?

461
00:23:09,473 --> 00:23:10,940
You're adorable.

462
00:23:10,942 --> 00:23:12,474
Well, if there is
a problem,

463
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:13,610
I'll drop this thing
and come right back.

464
00:23:13,612 --> 00:23:14,844
You won't need to.

465
00:23:14,846 --> 00:23:17,015
I got it,
you go do this thing.

466
00:23:17,816 --> 00:23:19,749
Do it so...

467
00:23:19,751 --> 00:23:22,451
I can do it better.

468
00:23:22,453 --> 00:23:24,621
Deavor here.

469
00:23:24,623 --> 00:23:26,055
This is Elastigirl.

470
00:23:26,057 --> 00:23:27,092
I'm in.

471
00:23:30,562 --> 00:23:33,196
Mr. Deavor,
it's wonderful...

472
00:23:33,198 --> 00:23:34,797
<i>but it's too generous.</i>

473
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,232
Nonsense! That's the
least we can do.

474
00:23:36,234 --> 00:23:37,767
We're partners now!

475
00:23:37,769 --> 00:23:39,736
Can't have my partners
living in a motel.

476
00:23:39,738 --> 00:23:42,105
But whose house?
Is it a house?

477
00:23:42,107 --> 00:23:44,007
<i>It's my house.
I have several.</i>

478
00:23:44,009 --> 00:23:46,576
<i>I'm not using that one.
Stay as long as you need.</i>

479
00:23:46,578 --> 00:23:48,144
I don't know
what to say.

480
00:23:48,146 --> 00:23:50,515
How about "thanks"?

481
00:23:51,182 --> 00:23:53,082
This is our new house?

482
00:23:53,084 --> 00:23:56,586
Okay, easy, tiger.
It's being loaned to us.

483
00:23:56,588 --> 00:23:58,655
This is homey.

484
00:23:58,657 --> 00:23:59,989
Look at this place.

485
00:23:59,991 --> 00:24:02,692
Deavor bought it from
an eccentric billionaire...

486
00:24:02,694 --> 00:24:04,193
who liked to come and go
without being seen...

487
00:24:04,195 --> 00:24:06,863
so the house has
multiple hidden exits.

488
00:24:06,865 --> 00:24:08,531
Good thing
we won't stand out.

489
00:24:08,533 --> 00:24:11,668
Wouldn't want to attract
any unnecessary attention.

490
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:13,703
It's got
a big yard!

491
00:24:13,705 --> 00:24:15,939
Isn't this a bit much?

492
00:24:15,941 --> 00:24:17,740
Near a forest!

493
00:24:17,742 --> 00:24:19,609
Would you rather be
at the motel?

494
00:24:19,611 --> 00:24:20,944
And a pool!

495
00:24:21,913 --> 00:24:24,080
What exactly
is Mom's new job?

496
00:24:24,082 --> 00:24:26,716
The important thing is
we're out of the motel.

497
00:24:26,718 --> 00:24:29,087
I like Mom's new job!

498
00:24:30,155 --> 00:24:32,090
Oh, ho, ho!

499
00:24:35,093 --> 00:24:38,027
Whoa.

500
00:24:38,029 --> 00:24:39,130
Whoa.

501
00:24:41,066 --> 00:24:43,533
Well, check out
the water features.

502
00:24:45,704 --> 00:24:47,038
- Oh!
- Wow.

503
00:24:49,107 --> 00:24:51,140
Wicked cool!

504
00:24:56,715 --> 00:24:58,181
Hey! Dash! Stop it!

505
00:24:58,183 --> 00:24:59,983
- Not the couch! Stop it!
- No! Dash!

506
00:24:59,985 --> 00:25:01,584
Stop!

507
00:25:01,586 --> 00:25:02,752
- Don't touch the buttons!
- The couch!

508
00:25:02,754 --> 00:25:03,920
- Dash!
- No!

509
00:25:03,922 --> 00:25:05,855
No, no!

510
00:25:05,857 --> 00:25:07,757
Oh, no.
Oh, boy.

511
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:10,199
This isn't me.

512
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:15,598
I'm not all dark
and angsty.

513
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,733
I'm Elastigirl.

514
00:25:16,735 --> 00:25:18,735
I'm, you know,
flexible.

515
00:25:18,737 --> 00:25:19,969
E designed this?

516
00:25:19,971 --> 00:25:22,939
No, some guy named
Alexander Galbaki.

517
00:25:22,941 --> 00:25:25,074
Glad it's you and not me,

518
00:25:25,076 --> 00:25:27,810
'cause you're gonna
hear from her.

519
00:25:27,812 --> 00:25:29,212
This note came with it.

520
00:25:29,214 --> 00:25:30,215
What?

521
00:25:37,155 --> 00:25:39,155
A new Elasticycle.

522
00:25:39,157 --> 00:25:42,091
Elasticycle? I didn't
know you had a bike.

523
00:25:42,093 --> 00:25:42,992
Hey, I had a mohawk.

524
00:25:42,994 --> 00:25:44,827
There's a lot about me
you don't know.

525
00:25:44,829 --> 00:25:46,863
Yeah, but...
A mohawk?

526
00:25:46,865 --> 00:25:49,198
Ah, you didn't miss anything.

527
00:25:51,636 --> 00:25:54,003
Oh, yeah!
This one's electric.

528
00:25:54,005 --> 00:25:57,108
- What's that mean?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

529
00:25:59,844 --> 00:26:02,812
Means it's torque-y.
I'll get the hang of it.

530
00:26:02,814 --> 00:26:04,080
You will be great.

531
00:26:04,082 --> 00:26:05,915
I will be great.
And you will, too.

532
00:26:05,917 --> 00:26:07,717
We will both be great.

533
00:26:07,719 --> 00:26:08,953
Bye, sweetie.

534
00:26:31,776 --> 00:26:33,142
Wait a minute!

535
00:26:33,144 --> 00:26:34,677
- Is that Elastigirl?
- I think that's Elastigirl.

536
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:36,848
Hey! Elastigirl!

537
00:26:42,854 --> 00:26:44,989
Marry me, Elastigirl!

No theme songs

541

or I'll turn this bus
right around!

542
00:26:56,668 --> 00:26:58,234
Look at that.

543
00:26:58,236 --> 00:26:59,235
New Urbem.

544
00:26:59,237 --> 00:27:01,370
You wanna make a big
crime fighting statement...

545
00:27:01,372 --> 00:27:03,106
you go where
the crime is big.

546
00:27:03,108 --> 00:27:05,708
Strange thing to be
excited about, Winston.

547
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:07,979
It's like
a superhero's playground!

548
00:27:11,783 --> 00:27:14,250
No Sugar Bombs
on my watch.

549
00:27:17,255 --> 00:27:18,354
Where's Mom?

550
00:27:18,356 --> 00:27:19,689
She's up and out.

551
00:27:19,691 --> 00:27:21,124
She's at her new job
doing hero work.

552
00:27:21,126 --> 00:27:23,926
But I thought superheroes
were still illegal.

553
00:27:23,928 --> 00:27:25,361
They are, for now.

554
00:27:25,363 --> 00:27:28,731
So Mom is getting paid
to break the law?

555
00:27:28,733 --> 00:27:29,966
She's not breaking...

556
00:27:29,968 --> 00:27:32,335
She's an advocate
for superheroes.

557
00:27:32,337 --> 00:27:33,469
It's a new job.

558
00:27:33,471 --> 00:27:36,272
So, Mom is going out
illegally...

559
00:27:36,274 --> 00:27:39,742
to explain why
she shouldn't be illegal.

560
00:27:39,744 --> 00:27:41,444
Hey... Hey!

561
00:27:41,446 --> 00:27:43,146
The bus is here!

562
00:27:43,148 --> 00:27:47,817
Whoa! Grab your stuff quickly!
Go on, get on the...

563

Put your homework
in your pack!

564

Bye-bye!

565
00:27:58,029 --> 00:28:00,429
We're gonna get along
just fine...

566
00:28:00,431 --> 00:28:04,033

<i>Stand by.</i>

570
00:28:10,775 --> 00:28:13,476
Seems strange
to wait for crime.

571
00:28:13,478 --> 00:28:15,311
Relax.
You're smack in the middle...

572
00:28:15,313 --> 00:28:18,948
of the worst crime area
in the city. It's perfect.

573
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:20,349
It's a superhero's

576
00:28:23,755 --> 00:28:25,788
my husband used to listen
to a police scanner...

577
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,390
waiting for something
to happen.

578
00:28:27,392 --> 00:28:29,325
And I got mad at him
for it.

579
00:28:31,029 --> 00:28:32,461
Oh, I'm such a hypocrite.

10-ish,
heading for 9:30-ish.

590
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,887

00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:08,678
- What about a fail-safe?
<i>- Not enough time.</i>

644
00:32:11,583 --> 00:32:13,550
Someone's calling!
Switching over.

645
00:32:13,552 --> 00:32:15,451
<i>Hey, Mom.
I can't find my high-tops</i>

646
00:32:15,453 --> 00:32:17,119
<i>and Dad
can't find them either.</i>

647
00:32:17,121 --> 00:32:19,321
<i>But he won't call you
and ask, so I am.</i>

648
00:32:19,323 --> 00:32:20,990
<i>Do not call your mother!</i>

649
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,391
Dash, honey.
Can't talk right now.

650
00:32:22,393 --> 00:32:24,293
Look under your bed, okay.
How much time?

651
00:32:24,295 --> 00:32:26,262
<i>Less than two minutes!</i>

652
00:32:26,264 --> 00:32:28,344
<i>There's a shortcut. Cut
through the culvert up ahead.</i>

653
00:32:36,407 --> 00:32:38,644
I don't know
if I can stay with it.

654
00:34:47,171 --> 00:34:48,838
What the heck was that?

655
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,140
Is everybody all right?
Is anybody injured?

656
00:34:51,142 --> 00:34:52,410
Are you all right?

657
00:34:55,681 --> 00:34:57,448
Your story better be good.

658
00:34:59,183 --> 00:35:01,283
Hey. Hey!

659
00:35:01,285 --> 00:35:02,786
What happened?

660
00:35:36,253 --> 00:35:37,487
Honey, why are you...

661
00:35:37,489 --> 00:35:40,324
Don't say anything.

662
00:35:44,395 --> 00:35:46,763
It's Dad.
Are you okay?

663
00:35:46,765 --> 00:35:49,966
I'm fine. I don't
wanna talk about it.

664
00:35:49,968 --> 00:35:51,635
Tony didn't even call?

665
00:35:51,637 --> 00:35:53,670
I don't wanna
talk about it.

666
00:35:53,672 --> 00:35:55,404
- Oh, honey...
- Dad!

667
00:35:55,406 --> 00:35:59,274
If you want me to feel
better, then leave me alone.

668
00:35:59,276 --> 00:36:00,376
Please?

669
00:36:00,378 --> 00:36:01,578
<i>See, there's nothing</i>

670
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,912
<i>a cop hates worse
than a missing child.</i>

671
00:36:02,914 --> 00:36:05,515
<i>My kid brother's son.
Today is his first birthday.</i>

672
00:36:05,517 --> 00:36:06,883
<i>Oh, but if anybody</i>

673
00:36:06,885 --> 00:36:09,218
<i>can find that child,
it's you, Roman.</i>

674
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,755
<i>Because you're
a wonderful policeman.</i>

675
00:36:11,757 --> 00:36:14,557
<i>This is a holdup.</i>

676
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:16,660
<i>All right, get your hands up,
turn your back.</i>

677
00:36:16,662 --> 00:36:17,927
<i>Put your hands behind</i>

678
00:36:17,929 --> 00:36:19,428
<i>your heads
and keep them there!</i>

679
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,830
<i>Don't move!</i>

680
00:36:20,832 --> 00:36:23,933
<i>Drop that.
All right, now get over there.</i>

681
00:36:23,935 --> 00:36:26,402
<i>Watch the door.</i>

682
00:36:26,404 --> 00:36:27,673
<i>You think I'm kiddin'?</i>

683
00:36:31,308 --> 00:36:32,441
<i>Now.</i>

684
00:36:35,814 --> 00:36:37,547
<i>I said now!</i>

685
00:36:37,549 --> 00:36:40,282
<i>I got it! Come on,
I tell you, come on!</i>

686
00:36:41,953 --> 00:36:43,555
<i>You wanna get killed?</i>

687
00:37:39,443 --> 00:37:40,812
Uh-oh.

688
00:38:17,649 --> 00:38:20,950
No, no, no!

689
00:38:23,655 --> 00:38:25,824
No!

690
00:38:27,125 --> 00:38:29,726
No, no, no.

691
00:38:29,728 --> 00:38:31,561
No, no, no.

692
00:38:31,563 --> 00:38:33,765
No, no, no!

693
00:38:41,573 --> 00:38:45,008
You have powers!

694
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:46,609
Yeah, baby,

695
00:38:46,611 --> 00:38:48,678
and there's not
a scratch on you!

696
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,412
Did you go through
the locked door?

697
00:38:50,414 --> 00:38:52,682
Are those your powers?

698
00:38:52,684 --> 00:38:54,784
Who can multiply
like rabbits

699
00:38:54,786 --> 00:38:57,754
and go right through
any solid...

700
00:39:01,726 --> 00:39:04,496
Oh, my God!

701
00:39:09,534 --> 00:39:10,967
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, honey.</i>

702
00:39:10,969 --> 00:39:12,836
- You weren't gonna call me?
<i>- Oh, hey!</i>

703
00:39:12,838 --> 00:39:14,971
No. I mean, yes, yeah...

704
00:39:14,973 --> 00:39:17,406
I just didn't wanna wake you.

705
00:39:17,408 --> 00:39:20,475
The strangest thing just
happened out in the yard.

706
00:39:20,477 --> 00:39:21,611
Sounds like I just
woke you up.

707
00:39:21,613 --> 00:39:23,112
<i>No, no.</i>

708
00:39:23,114 --> 00:39:24,814
- It's just, Jack-Jack...
- <i>He had an accident!</i>

709
00:39:24,816 --> 00:39:25,882
I knew it!

710
00:39:25,884 --> 00:39:27,817
I'm coming home right now!
I never should have...

711
00:39:27,819 --> 00:39:30,153
No accident. Stay there
and finish your mission.

712
00:39:30,155 --> 00:39:31,688
You never should...

713
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:33,756
What? You don't think
I can do this?

714
00:39:33,758 --> 00:39:36,458
No, no.
Sorry. I misspoke.

715
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,861
Do you need me
to come back?

716
00:39:37,863 --> 00:39:40,730
No, no. No, I've got this.
Everything's great.

717
00:39:40,732 --> 00:39:42,466
What happened
with Jack-Jack?

718
00:39:43,635 --> 00:39:45,869
Nothing.
He's in excellent health.

719
00:39:45,871 --> 00:39:47,971
<i>Well, that's good.</i>

720
00:39:47,973 --> 00:39:50,640
- <i>How was Violet's date?</i>
- Uh...

721
00:39:50,642 --> 00:39:52,441
<i>That was tonight, right?</i>

722
00:39:52,443 --> 00:39:55,011
Yes. Good.

723
00:39:55,013 --> 00:39:57,013
All fine and good.

724
00:39:57,015 --> 00:39:58,982
And Jack-Jack went down
with no trouble?

725
00:39:58,984 --> 00:40:00,750
Fine, yes, no trouble.

726
00:40:00,752 --> 00:40:02,619
And Dash got
his homework done?

727
00:40:02,621 --> 00:40:03,887
All done.

728
00:40:03,889 --> 00:40:05,154
So, things haven't
spiraled out

729
00:40:05,156 --> 00:40:06,155
of control
the moment I left?

730
00:40:06,157 --> 00:40:08,024
Amazing as it may seem,

731
00:40:08,026 --> 00:40:10,693
it has been
quite uneventful in fact.

732
00:40:10,695 --> 00:40:12,128
<i>How about you?</i>

733
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:15,033
I saved a runaway train!

734
00:40:16,601 --> 00:40:18,134
<i>It was so great!</i>

735
00:40:18,136 --> 00:40:20,904
The mayor was there to cut
the ribbon on this new train.

736
00:40:20,906 --> 00:40:22,705
<i>Elastigirl pursued the train</i>

737
00:40:22,707 --> 00:40:24,874
<i>and was able
to successfully activate...</i>

738
00:40:24,876 --> 00:40:27,176
Blah, blah, blah. He says a
few words, cuts the ribbon...

739
00:40:27,178 --> 00:40:28,511
and the train starts pulling

740
00:40:28,513 --> 00:40:30,046
out of the station
backwards...

741
00:40:30,048 --> 00:40:31,748
<i>...track of
its brand new hovertrain...</i>

742
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:33,516
<i>...malfunctioned...</i>

743
00:40:33,518 --> 00:40:34,719
<i>...thanking Elastigirl...</i>

744
00:40:35,921 --> 00:40:37,186
<i>Superhero Elastigirl...</i>

745
00:40:37,188 --> 00:40:38,521
<i>Elastigirl...</i>

746
00:40:38,523 --> 00:40:41,791
Boom! No casualties!

747
00:40:41,793 --> 00:40:43,059
<i>...specialized motorbike,</i>

748
00:40:43,061 --> 00:40:44,661
<i>saving all of
the passengers...</i>

749
00:40:44,663 --> 00:40:45,762
<i>One thing
leads to another</i>

750
00:40:45,764 --> 00:40:46,930
<i>and suddenly,
I go after it!</i>

751
00:40:46,932 --> 00:40:49,232
<i>I'm telling you, honey,
it was a saga!</i>

752
00:40:49,234 --> 00:40:51,200
That's fantastic, honey!

753
00:40:51,202 --> 00:40:53,603
And on your first night!

754
00:40:53,605 --> 00:40:56,639
I am so proud of you, really.

755
00:40:56,641 --> 00:40:58,174
<i>I'm proud of you, honey.</i>

756
00:40:58,176 --> 00:41:00,843
I know you want to get out
there and you will soon.

757
00:41:00,845 --> 00:41:02,812
And you'll be amazing.

758
00:41:02,814 --> 00:41:04,047
I couldn't have done this

759
00:41:04,049 --> 00:41:05,682
if you hadn't
taken over so well.

760
00:41:05,684 --> 00:41:07,517
<i>Thanks for handling
everything.</i>

761
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:08,918
It's nothing.

762
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,021
I love you, honey.
I'll be back soon.

763
00:41:12,023 --> 00:41:14,993
- <i>Sweet dreams.</i>
- Sweet dreams, honey.

764
00:41:31,142 --> 00:41:34,043
"Hey, Dad, it's okay.

765
00:41:34,045 --> 00:41:36,846
"I'll just wait for Mom
to get home."

766
00:41:36,848 --> 00:41:39,818
As if she could...
I know how to...

767
00:41:40,585 --> 00:41:41,987
I can do math.

768
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:54,199
Oh, brother...

769
00:41:56,835 --> 00:41:58,737
Wait for Mom!

770
00:41:59,938 --> 00:42:02,207
What am I,
a substitute parent?

771
00:42:04,976 --> 00:42:07,012
It's not my fault
they changed math.

772
00:42:15,653 --> 00:42:17,987
Come on, buddy.
Come on.

773
00:42:17,989 --> 00:42:20,790
I think I understand
your math assignment.

774
00:42:20,792 --> 00:42:24,627
We still have some time
to finish it before your test.

775
00:42:24,629 --> 00:42:26,596
So first, you wanna put
all the numbers

776
00:42:26,598 --> 00:42:28,364
by themselves on one side.

777
00:42:28,366 --> 00:42:30,199
...you change the sign.

778
00:42:30,201 --> 00:42:33,236
That means a plus becomes
a minus and a minus...

779
00:42:33,238 --> 00:42:34,737
You got it?

780
00:42:34,739 --> 00:42:36,141
Yeah, baby!

781
00:42:50,155 --> 00:42:52,722
Oh. Uh, hello.

782
00:42:52,724 --> 00:42:54,057
We're in a new house.

783
00:42:54,059 --> 00:42:57,326
I did write my address
on your locker...

784
00:42:57,328 --> 00:42:59,362
in permanent ink.

785
00:42:59,364 --> 00:43:01,664
Oh, is that what that is?

786
00:43:01,666 --> 00:43:03,166
Did you forget?

787
00:43:03,168 --> 00:43:05,203
Forget what?

788
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:08,173
That's funny.

789
00:43:11,242 --> 00:43:12,811
Points for funny.

790
00:43:13,945 --> 00:43:16,079
Oh, was it
the weird outfit?

791
00:43:16,081 --> 00:43:18,681
Because there's a reason.

792
00:43:18,683 --> 00:43:20,817
I'm in a drama class...

793
00:43:20,819 --> 00:43:23,019
and they just wanna do
Shakespeare...

794
00:43:23,021 --> 00:43:24,987
but they're like, "Try to make
it relevant for the kids."

795
00:43:24,989 --> 00:43:27,256
So, like, "Oh, superheroes!
Kids love superheroes."

796
00:43:27,258 --> 00:43:28,691
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

797
00:43:28,693 --> 00:43:29,659
You wanna wear
one kind of tights...

798
00:43:29,661 --> 00:43:30,927
and then they're like,

799
00:43:30,929 --> 00:43:32,228
"No, wear these
other kind of tights."

800
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:33,264
Do I know you?

801
00:43:42,107 --> 00:43:44,273
<i>Many say your speech
today is critical.</i>

802
00:43:44,275 --> 00:43:47,043
<i>Both sides just want the
best for their people.</i>

803
00:43:47,045 --> 00:43:50,913
<i>We are so close to finally
getting peace in the region.</i>

804
00:43:50,915 --> 00:43:52,815
I haven't done this
in a while.

805
00:43:52,817 --> 00:43:55,118
This is good. The train
gives us momentum.

806
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,353
Just go out there and
be your charming self...

807
00:43:57,355 --> 00:43:58,821
and capitalize on it.

808
00:43:58,823 --> 00:44:01,290
Ms. Elastigirl,
they're ready for you.

809
00:44:01,292 --> 00:44:03,061
Hey, stretch a leg.

810
00:44:04,996 --> 00:44:06,729
Thank you, Chad.
It was fun.

811
00:44:06,731 --> 00:44:09,000
Ambassador, your documents.
We're moving to the rooftop.

812
00:44:10,001 --> 00:44:12,001
Oh, Madame Ambassador,
hello!

813
00:44:12,003 --> 00:44:13,369
Oh, you are Elastigirl!

814
00:44:13,371 --> 00:44:15,872
This is why now
I'm shaking your hand.

815
00:44:15,874 --> 00:44:18,007
It was so sad
when you went underground.

816
00:44:18,009 --> 00:44:22,011
I am glad to see you back
in your shiny outfit.

817
00:44:22,013 --> 00:44:23,412
That means so much
coming from you.

818
00:44:23,414 --> 00:44:24,747
Good luck
with your speech.

819
00:44:24,749 --> 00:44:26,115
This way, Ambassador.

820
00:44:26,117 --> 00:44:27,450
Bring lasting peace!

821
00:44:27,452 --> 00:44:29,352
I will,
when you defeat evil.

822
00:44:29,354 --> 00:44:31,454
Okay.

823
00:44:31,456 --> 00:44:33,224
Three, two...

824
00:44:33,992 --> 00:44:35,291
For over 15 years,

825
00:44:35,293 --> 00:44:36,893
superheroes have been
in hiding.

826
00:44:36,895 --> 00:44:38,895
Forced into it
by a society

827
00:44:38,897 --> 00:44:40,429
no longer willing
to support them.

828
00:44:40,431 --> 00:44:42,064
That may soon be changing...

829
00:44:42,066 --> 00:44:44,501
due to a growing movement
to bring the Supers back.

830
00:44:44,503 --> 00:44:46,335
Here, fresh on the heels
of her own

831
00:44:46,337 --> 00:44:48,271
heroic save
of a runaway train...

832
00:44:48,273 --> 00:44:51,807
and sporting a new look,
is the superhero, Elastigirl.

833
00:44:51,809 --> 00:44:53,142
- Welcome!
- Hello, Chad.

834
00:44:53,144 --> 00:44:55,311
All the polls are going
in your direction.

835
00:44:55,313 --> 00:44:57,046
That's true.
Things are good...

836
00:44:57,048 --> 00:44:58,447
Hello.

837
00:44:58,449 --> 00:45:00,149
Uh, hello?

838
00:45:00,151 --> 00:45:02,351
Do I have your attention?

839
00:45:02,353 --> 00:45:03,786
Yes, Chad.

840
00:45:03,788 --> 00:45:05,054
Of course I do.

841
00:45:05,056 --> 00:45:06,923
I'm appearing
on your screen.

842
00:45:06,925 --> 00:45:09,992
Reading the words I'm saying
off of another screen.

843
00:45:09,994 --> 00:45:11,894
Screens are everywhere.

844
00:45:11,896 --> 00:45:13,056
We are controlled by screens.

845
00:45:14,832 --> 00:45:19,802
<i>And screens
are controlled by me...</i>

846
00:45:19,804 --> 00:45:21,370
<i>Screenslaver.</i>

847
00:45:21,372 --> 00:45:22,805
Hey!

848
00:45:22,807 --> 00:45:24,941
<i>I control this broadcast...</i>

849
00:45:24,943 --> 00:45:27,343
and this idiotic anchorman
you see before you.

850
00:45:27,345 --> 00:45:29,078
What's wrong
with him?

851
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,079
The signal's been hijacked.
I'll check it out.

852
00:45:30,081 --> 00:45:31,847
Don't look at any monitors.

853
00:45:31,849 --> 00:45:34,116
I could hijack
the ambassador's aerocade...

854
00:45:34,118 --> 00:45:36,419
while it's still airborne.

855
00:45:36,421 --> 00:45:38,223
Right, Elastigirl?

856
00:45:40,325 --> 00:45:42,927
Nearest window!
Where's the nearest window?

857
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,106
- Oh, what's going on?
- Where's Elastigirl?

858
00:45:57,108 --> 00:45:58,843
Which one?

859
00:46:07,352 --> 00:46:09,252
Elastigirl!
What are you doing here?

860
00:46:09,254 --> 00:46:11,588
The ambassador is in danger.
Which chopper is she...

861
00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:13,124
Look out!

862
00:46:14,593 --> 00:46:16,961
Follow them
and get me close!

863
00:46:19,464 --> 00:46:22,267
Get out of the sky,
and touch down safely!

864
00:46:31,209 --> 00:46:34,844
Stand down! It's Elastigirl.

865
00:46:34,846 --> 00:46:36,447
Stay in your seat, ma'am!

866
00:46:43,121 --> 00:46:45,254
We're under attack!

867
00:46:45,256 --> 00:46:48,226
Quick, go!
Protect the ambassador!

868
00:46:51,597 --> 00:46:52,895
Open the door!

869
00:46:52,897 --> 00:46:54,098
Do as she says!

870
00:46:56,134 --> 00:46:57,233
Can you all swim?

871
00:46:57,235 --> 00:46:58,903
- Yeah.
- No!

872
00:47:20,224 --> 00:47:23,192
We're gonna have
to slingshot! Hang on!

873
00:47:30,201 --> 00:47:32,536
Are you all right, ma'am?

874
00:47:32,538 --> 00:47:34,339
I'm perfectly fine...

875
00:47:36,575 --> 00:47:38,142
Ah! Ooh! Ah! Oh!

876
00:47:44,148 --> 00:47:46,949
Boys are jerks
and superheroes suck.

877
00:47:46,951 --> 00:47:48,250
Good morning!

878
00:47:48,252 --> 00:47:50,152
He takes one look
at me in that suit...

879
00:47:50,154 --> 00:47:54,056
and decides to pretend
he doesn't even know me.

880
00:47:54,058 --> 00:47:56,158
He's protecting himself.

881
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,028
If he really did see you,
it's best that he forget.

882
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:00,963
It's better for you, too.

883
00:48:00,965 --> 00:48:03,065
I can't tell you
how many memories

884
00:48:03,067 --> 00:48:05,368
Dicker's had to erase
over the years...

885
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:07,169
when someone figured out

886
00:48:07,171 --> 00:48:08,971
your mother's
or my identity.

887
00:48:08,973 --> 00:48:11,307
It was Dicker!

888
00:48:11,309 --> 00:48:13,543
- You told him about Tony!
- Honey...

889
00:48:13,545 --> 00:48:16,481
You had me erased
from Tony's mind!

890
00:48:29,994 --> 00:48:31,695
I hate superheroes!

891
00:48:31,697 --> 00:48:33,998
And I renounce them!

892
00:48:40,037 --> 00:48:41,971
I renounce them!

893
00:48:50,616 --> 00:48:52,516
Is she having adolescence?

894
00:48:53,685 --> 00:48:55,351
<i>A new report
out today shows that,</i>

895
00:48:55,353 --> 00:48:57,186
<i>when it comes
to decision-making...</i>

896
00:48:57,188 --> 00:48:59,021
<i>people have more trust
in a monkey</i>

897
00:48:59,023 --> 00:49:00,389
<i>throwing darts than Congress.</i>

898
00:49:00,391 --> 00:49:02,559
What's going on, Tommy?
A protest?

899
00:49:02,561 --> 00:49:04,661
They're here in support.

900
00:49:04,663 --> 00:49:06,996
Support? Support of what?

901
00:49:06,998 --> 00:49:09,566
Well, in support of you.

902
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:14,671
Wow. Oh, hey...

903
00:49:14,673 --> 00:49:17,306
Thanks for coming out. Hi.

904
00:49:17,308 --> 00:49:20,075
Oh, my goodness.
Thanks so much.

905
00:49:20,077 --> 00:49:21,210
Oh, hello.

906
00:49:21,212 --> 00:49:22,581
What does your sign say?

907
00:49:27,051 --> 00:49:28,618
Ka-boom! Ka-pow!

908
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:31,220
Supers should be legal now!

909
00:49:31,222 --> 00:49:33,523
Talk to ya.
Oh, what do ya know!

910
00:49:33,525 --> 00:49:34,624
Ellenwood.

911
00:49:34,626 --> 00:49:36,660
Oh, now you wanna
return my calls

912
00:49:36,662 --> 00:49:38,027
about superheroes, huh?

913
00:49:38,029 --> 00:49:39,729
Oh. I'll have to
call you back.

914
00:49:39,731 --> 00:49:41,130
Oh, that felt good.

915
00:49:41,132 --> 00:49:42,331
Felicia, hold my calls,
please.

916
00:49:42,333 --> 00:49:44,133
Hey!
It's working!

917
00:49:44,135 --> 00:49:46,268
Hey, the ambassador
made a big speech

918
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:47,470
about superheroes today.

919
00:49:47,472 --> 00:49:49,205
Turns out
saving someone's life

920
00:49:49,207 --> 00:49:50,607
makes a good impression
on them. Who knew, huh?

921
00:49:50,609 --> 00:49:53,108
I'm getting calls
from all over the world.

922
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:55,512
Media awareness
is up 72%.

923
00:49:55,514 --> 00:49:57,614
The push
for superhero legalization

924
00:49:57,616 --> 00:49:59,616
is becoming
a worldwide movement!

925
00:49:59,618 --> 00:50:01,518
I have big plans
for our next move.

926
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,352
We're gonna have
a summit at sea.

927
00:50:03,354 --> 00:50:04,453
We'll use our ship...

928
00:50:04,455 --> 00:50:06,690
we'll gather leaders
and Supers...

929
00:50:06,692 --> 00:50:09,425
- from all over the world.
- That's great.

930
00:50:09,427 --> 00:50:10,560
I'm happy.

931
00:50:10,562 --> 00:50:12,228
I'm happy
the numbers are up.

932
00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:15,331
I'm happy the ambassador
is pro-superhero...

933
00:50:15,333 --> 00:50:17,099
and I'm happy
you're happy.

934
00:50:17,101 --> 00:50:20,369
I'm hearing that you're happy,
but why am I not feeling it?

935
00:50:20,371 --> 00:50:22,104
Because I didn't get him!

936
00:50:22,106 --> 00:50:23,507
Screenslaver
is still out there.

937
00:50:23,509 --> 00:50:26,342
All I did was play his game
and win this round.

938
00:50:26,344 --> 00:50:27,511
He's gonna want more

939
00:50:27,513 --> 00:50:29,646
and as long as
he gets to play, he wins.

940
00:50:29,648 --> 00:50:31,715
One thing
I've learned in business?

941
00:50:31,717 --> 00:50:33,650
Smell the flowers.

942
00:50:33,652 --> 00:50:35,184
They don't bloom that often.

943
00:50:35,186 --> 00:50:36,653
What do you want
on your tombstone?

944
00:50:36,655 --> 00:50:37,787
"She worried a lot"?

945
00:50:37,789 --> 00:50:39,789
All right,
stop talking.

946
00:50:39,791 --> 00:50:41,192
Show her.

947
00:50:46,264 --> 00:50:49,265
This is just so exciting, isn't it?
Huh?

948
00:50:51,269 --> 00:50:53,202
Oh, wow. Uh...

949
00:50:53,204 --> 00:50:56,405
Wow! Elastigirl,
there you are.

950
00:50:56,407 --> 00:50:57,841
- Hello.
- I didn't...

951
00:50:57,843 --> 00:50:59,308
Wow!

952
00:50:59,310 --> 00:51:01,645
Come on, get yourself
together, Karen.

953
00:51:01,647 --> 00:51:04,748
Hi, my superhero name
is Voyd.

954
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:08,752
I just wanna thank you,
for, like, for being you!

955
00:51:10,689 --> 00:51:14,292
Okay, what I can do,
um, is this.

956
00:51:19,397 --> 00:51:21,463
Yeah.

957
00:51:21,465 --> 00:51:25,234
That is impressive.
Very interdimensional.

958
00:51:25,236 --> 00:51:27,436
I felt like
an outcast before.

959
00:51:27,438 --> 00:51:32,174
But now, with you being
you, I feel like...

960
00:51:33,579 --> 00:51:34,580
Yay, me.

961
00:51:35,647 --> 00:51:37,614
I flew them in
from all over.

962
00:51:37,616 --> 00:51:39,481
They've all been
in hiding.

963
00:51:39,483 --> 00:51:41,685
They have powers,
secret identities...

964
00:51:41,687 --> 00:51:44,554
and names
they've given themselves.

965
00:51:44,556 --> 00:51:46,856
I'm Screech.
It's a pleasure.

966
00:51:46,858 --> 00:51:48,257
I've always considered you

967
00:51:48,259 --> 00:51:50,326
the gold standard
for superheroes.

968
00:51:50,328 --> 00:51:52,461
Well, thanks.
You're too nice.

969
00:51:52,463 --> 00:51:54,363
I am called Brick.

970
00:51:54,365 --> 00:51:57,734
Nice to meet you, Brick.
Uh, where are you from?

971
00:51:57,736 --> 00:51:59,301
Wisconsin.

972
00:51:59,303 --> 00:52:02,438
Oh. Elastigirl.
I assume your powers are...

973
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,708
You know,
zapping things electrically...

974
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:07,242
charging things, bolts of
lightning, that kind of stuff.

975
00:52:07,244 --> 00:52:08,712
Name's Reflux.

976
00:52:08,714 --> 00:52:11,681
Medical condition or
superpower, you decide.

977
00:52:11,683 --> 00:52:13,315
That's a little line

978
00:52:13,317 --> 00:52:14,751
I say just to put
people at ease.

979
00:52:14,753 --> 00:52:15,885
Hope I don't offend.

980
00:52:15,887 --> 00:52:17,921
Oh, no, no, no.
Reflux. Love it.

981
00:52:19,357 --> 00:52:22,257
Well, I do look forward
to working with you.

982
00:52:22,259 --> 00:52:25,327
Yes, that is impressive.
Keep practicing.

983
00:52:26,698 --> 00:52:28,230
Ow!

984
00:52:31,268 --> 00:52:34,638
Well, I'm beat. Congratulations.
Big day.

985
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,206
Good night, ladies.
I will see you tomorrow.

986
00:52:37,208 --> 00:52:38,508
Good night.

987
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:40,209
Must be nice for you,

988
00:52:40,211 --> 00:52:41,778
being out front
after all this time.

989
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:43,345
Out front?

990
00:52:43,347 --> 00:52:45,915
Well, it's been a while
since your superhero days...

991
00:52:45,917 --> 00:52:47,751
and even then,
you were kind of

992
00:52:47,753 --> 00:52:49,351
in Mr. Incredible's
shadow.

993
00:52:49,353 --> 00:52:50,787
Nah, I beg to differ.

994
00:52:50,789 --> 00:52:52,789
I'm not... I'm not
saying you weren't big.

995
00:52:52,791 --> 00:52:54,791
No, you were,
and are, a superstar...

996
00:52:54,793 --> 00:52:57,727
but you have the stage
to yourself now.

997
00:52:57,729 --> 00:52:59,763
And people have
to pay attention.

998
00:52:59,765 --> 00:53:01,564
Oh, you mean, "It's a man's
world" and all that?

999
00:53:01,566 --> 00:53:03,432
Well, what world
do you live in?

1000
00:53:03,434 --> 00:53:04,768
Your brother runs DEVTECH.

1001
00:53:04,770 --> 00:53:08,905
I don't want his job.
I invent, he sells.

1002
00:53:08,907 --> 00:53:12,474
I ask you, which of us
has the greater influence?

1003
00:53:12,476 --> 00:53:13,943
Which side of me
are you asking?

1004
00:53:13,945 --> 00:53:15,411
The believer or the cynic?

1005
00:53:15,413 --> 00:53:16,680
The cynic...

1006
00:53:16,682 --> 00:53:18,414
Would say selling
is more important

1007
00:53:18,416 --> 00:53:20,449
because the best sellers
have the most buyers.

1008
00:53:20,451 --> 00:53:22,251
Doesn't matter
what you're selling.

1009
00:53:22,253 --> 00:53:23,987
It only matters
what people buy.

1010
00:53:23,989 --> 00:53:25,689
This is true.

1011
00:53:25,691 --> 00:53:27,657
If I discovered the
origin of the universe...

1012
00:53:27,659 --> 00:53:29,291
my brother
would find a way

1013
00:53:29,293 --> 00:53:32,261
to market it as a,
uh, foot massager.

1014
00:53:34,599 --> 00:53:36,499
So, what would
the believer say?

1015
00:53:36,501 --> 00:53:38,835
The believer would tell you
to make your mark.

1016
00:53:38,837 --> 00:53:41,303
Don't wait for permission,
assert yourself

1017
00:53:41,305 --> 00:53:42,806
and impose your will
on the status quo.

1018
00:53:42,808 --> 00:53:44,674
- Sounds like my brother.
- What?

1019
00:53:44,676 --> 00:53:45,975
You sound like my brother.

1020
00:53:45,977 --> 00:53:47,376
Well, he's not wrong.

1021
00:53:47,378 --> 00:53:48,712
There is an art
to getting a reaction...

1022
00:53:48,714 --> 00:53:50,446
Oh! I know
how to get him.

1023
00:53:50,448 --> 00:53:53,482
- My brother?
- No. Screenslaver!

1024
00:53:53,484 --> 00:53:56,285
You're tech-savvy. I need
to lock onto a signal...

1025
00:53:56,287 --> 00:53:57,453
and trace its origin.

1026
00:53:57,455 --> 00:53:58,588
How fast can you
slap something together

1027
00:53:58,590 --> 00:53:59,789
and meet me
at the airport?

1028
00:53:59,791 --> 00:54:00,790
Airport?

1029
00:54:00,792 --> 00:54:02,559
Need to go
out of town, pronto.

1030
00:54:02,561 --> 00:54:03,727
I can get your contraption
together by 5:00 a.m.

1031
00:54:03,729 --> 00:54:05,829
I need to get on TV.
Chad!

1032
00:54:05,831 --> 00:54:07,597
I'll get my brother to set up
an exclusive with him

1033
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:08,765
tonight on the newscast.

1034
00:54:08,767 --> 00:54:09,966
Finish our interview
by phone!

1035
00:54:09,968 --> 00:54:11,333
Promote the hell out of it.

1036
00:54:11,335 --> 00:54:12,736
Independence
from Screenslavery!

1037
00:54:12,738 --> 00:54:15,572
- Chad tonight.
- Boom!

1038
00:54:18,744 --> 00:54:20,409
- Dicker.
<i>- Yeah, hey, Rick.</i>

1039
00:54:20,411 --> 00:54:22,011
You remember that kid
I mentioned to you?

1040
00:54:22,013 --> 00:54:23,312
Tony Rydinger.

1041
00:54:23,314 --> 00:54:25,014
Mind wipe? Yeah, nice kid.

1042
00:54:25,016 --> 00:54:26,716
Well, you also wiped out

1043
00:54:26,718 --> 00:54:28,718
the Friday night date
my daughter had with him.

1044
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,353
In fact,
you wiped out my daughter.

1045
00:54:31,355 --> 00:54:33,623
Oops.
Not an exact science, Bob.

1046
00:54:33,625 --> 00:54:35,492
<i>Rick, you gotta help me here.</i>

1047
00:54:35,494 --> 00:54:38,528
Violet hates me, and you,
and superheroes.

1048
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:41,030
I gotta fix this.
What do you know about Tony?

1049
00:54:41,032 --> 00:54:42,431
Um...

1050
00:54:42,433 --> 00:54:43,900
Not much.

1051
00:54:43,902 --> 00:54:45,502
Seems like a good kid.

1052
00:54:45,504 --> 00:54:47,670
Popular,
plays sports, music.

1053
00:54:47,672 --> 00:54:51,508
Parents own The Happy Platter,
kid works there part time.

1054
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:53,678
Happy Platter?

1055
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:58,915
Why did we drive
all the way across town

1056
00:54:58,917 --> 00:55:00,717
for The Happy Platter?

1057
00:55:00,719 --> 00:55:04,353
We'd like a booth over there,
near the philodendron.

1058
00:55:04,355 --> 00:55:06,489
Good, right?
Near the philodendron.

1059
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,928
This platter doesn't look
all that happy to me.

1060
00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:13,897
It looks bored.

1061
00:55:13,899 --> 00:55:15,799
Ha-ha! The Bored Platter!

1062
00:55:15,801 --> 00:55:18,367
I thought Vi would want
a change of pace

1063
00:55:18,369 --> 00:55:19,536
from drive-in food.

1064
00:55:19,538 --> 00:55:21,436
I like drive-in food.

1065
00:55:21,438 --> 00:55:23,405
Does this mean vegetables?

1066
00:55:23,407 --> 00:55:25,407
A balanced diet
means vegetables, kiddo.

1067
00:55:25,409 --> 00:55:27,510
Get used to it.

1068
00:55:27,512 --> 00:55:29,546
Good evening, everyone.

1069
00:55:29,548 --> 00:55:31,147
Oh, no!

1070
00:55:31,149 --> 00:55:32,749
- Is she all right?
- Violet, are you okay?

1071
00:55:32,751 --> 00:55:33,950
Nothing to see here.

1072
00:55:33,952 --> 00:55:35,718
Yeah, more napkins
would be good.

1073
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:36,853
- I'm fine, I'm fine.
- It happens all the time here.

1074
00:55:36,855 --> 00:55:37,754
Mops it right up.

1075
00:55:37,756 --> 00:55:40,657
Normally, she doesn't
ever drip like this.

1076
00:55:40,659 --> 00:55:42,826
- Would you like water, sir?
- Yes.

1077
00:55:42,828 --> 00:55:45,795
Yes, I would.
This is my daughter...

1078
00:55:45,797 --> 00:55:47,497
- who you must know, right?
- God. Stop.

1079
00:55:47,499 --> 00:55:48,832
- Hello.
- Violet.

1080
00:55:48,834 --> 00:55:49,999
Hello, Violet.

1081
00:55:51,136 --> 00:55:52,602
Hey, Vi, say hi to...

1082
00:55:52,604 --> 00:55:53,970
Don't push it, Dad.

1083
00:55:53,972 --> 00:55:55,972
I'm Dash,
her little brother.

1084
00:55:55,974 --> 00:55:57,140
Hello.

1085
00:55:57,142 --> 00:55:59,609
Mmm. This is
really good water.

1086
00:55:59,611 --> 00:56:00,910
It's very refreshing.

1087
00:56:00,912 --> 00:56:01,778
Spring water, is it?

1088
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:04,681
I don't know, sir.
I think it's tap.

1089
00:56:04,683 --> 00:56:06,448
Well, it is very good.

1090
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:07,851
Excellent tap.

1091
00:56:07,853 --> 00:56:09,986
Excuse me.

1092
00:56:09,988 --> 00:56:11,821
Well, nice to meet you.

1093
00:56:11,823 --> 00:56:13,556
- Where'd she go?
- Mmm.

1094
00:56:13,558 --> 00:56:16,659
To find a good place
to be angry?

1095
00:56:16,661 --> 00:56:19,562
Tonight, we go now to
a special remote interview...

1096
00:56:19,564 --> 00:56:20,763
with Elastigirl.

1097
00:56:20,765 --> 00:56:21,798
<i>How you feeling, Chad?</i>

1098
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,066
<i>You doing all right?</i>

1099
00:56:23,068 --> 00:56:25,568
I'm fine.
The doctors checked me out.

1100
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:27,570
I have no memory
of the event.

1101
00:56:27,572 --> 00:56:29,471
I gotta tell you,
it's pretty strange

1102
00:56:29,473 --> 00:56:30,840
to see a recording...

1103
00:56:30,842 --> 00:56:33,509
<i>of yourself the night before
and have no recollection.</i>

1104
00:56:33,511 --> 00:56:35,078
<i>I don't think
anyone needs to worry.</i>

1105
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:37,547
<i>We've taken many precautions
tonight though.</i>

1106
00:56:37,549 --> 00:56:38,882
<i>Where are you right now?</i>

1107
00:56:38,884 --> 00:56:41,918
On a case, in a secure
undisclosed location.

1108
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,620
<i>I wanna talk
about you...</i>

1109
00:56:43,622 --> 00:56:46,022
<i>starting with your save
of a runaway train.</i>

1110
00:56:46,024 --> 00:56:48,591
<i>Here's an exclusive
unedited clip</i>

1111
00:56:48,593 --> 00:56:50,026
<i>from your own suit cam.</i>

1112
00:56:50,028 --> 00:56:51,127
<i>Roll the clip.</i>

1113
00:56:51,129 --> 00:56:53,897
<i>This thing's
really moving.</i>

1114
00:56:53,899 --> 00:56:56,633
<i>100 and climbing.
How much track is built?</i>

1115
00:56:56,635 --> 00:56:59,569
<i>About 25 miles.</i>

1116
00:56:59,571 --> 00:57:02,772
<i>The Screenslaver
interrupts this program...</i>

1117
00:57:02,774 --> 00:57:04,207
<i>for an important announcement.</i>

1118
00:57:04,209 --> 00:57:06,109
I'll be damned. She knew.

1119
00:57:06,111 --> 00:57:07,877
Let's see
if your gadget works.

1120
00:57:07,879 --> 00:57:10,146
<i>Don't bother
watching the rest.</i>

1121
00:57:10,148 --> 00:57:11,648
Gotcha!

1122
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:13,883
<i>Elastigirl doesn't
save the day.</i>

1123
00:57:13,885 --> 00:57:16,753
<i>She only postpones her defeat.</i>

1124
00:57:16,755 --> 00:57:18,955
<i>And while she postpones
her defeat...</i>

1125
00:57:18,957 --> 00:57:22,625
<i>you eat chips and watch
her confront problems...</i>

1126
00:57:22,627 --> 00:57:24,894
<i>that you are too lazy
to deal with.</i>

1127
00:57:24,896 --> 00:57:27,797
<i>Superheroes are part
of your brainless desire...</i>

1128
00:57:27,799 --> 00:57:31,034
<i>to replace true experience
with simulation.</i>

1129
00:57:31,036 --> 00:57:34,537
<i>You don't talk,
you watch talk shows.</i>

1130
00:57:34,539 --> 00:57:38,107
<i>You don't play games,
you watch game shows.</i>

1131
00:57:38,109 --> 00:57:41,177
<i>Travel, relationships, risk...</i>

1132
00:57:41,179 --> 00:57:44,113
<i>every meaningful experience
must be packaged...</i>

1133
00:57:44,115 --> 00:57:47,684
<i>and delivered to you
to watch at a distance.</i>

1134
00:57:47,686 --> 00:57:50,153
<i>So that you can remain
ever sheltered...</i>

1135
00:57:50,155 --> 00:57:51,854
<i>ever passive...</i>

1136
00:57:51,856 --> 00:57:54,257
<i>ever ravenous consumers...</i>

1137
00:57:54,259 --> 00:57:57,260
<i>who can't bring themselves
to rise from their couches...</i>

1138
00:57:57,262 --> 00:58:01,698
<i>break a sweat
and participate in life.</i>

1139
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:04,267
<i>You want superheroes
to protect you...</i>

1140
00:58:04,269 --> 00:58:08,571
<i>and make yourselves ever more
powerless in the process.</i>

1141
00:58:08,573 --> 00:58:12,108
<i>While you tell yourselves
you're being looked after.</i>

1142
00:58:12,110 --> 00:58:14,243
<i>That your interests
are being served.</i>

1143
00:58:14,245 --> 00:58:17,113
<i>And your rights
are being upheld.</i>

1144
00:58:17,115 --> 00:58:20,249
<i>So that the system can
keep stealing from you...</i>

1145
00:58:20,251 --> 00:58:23,119
<i>smiling at you all the while.</i>

1146
00:58:23,121 --> 00:58:26,823
<i>Go ahead,
send your Supers to stop me.</i>

1147
00:58:26,825 --> 00:58:29,158
<i>Grab your snacks,
watch your screens,</i>

1148
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,260
<i>and see what happens.</i>

1149
00:58:31,262 --> 00:58:34,297
<i>You are no longer in control.</i>

1150
00:58:34,299 --> 00:58:35,900
<i>I am.</i>

1151
01:00:17,435 --> 01:00:19,170
Find anything?

1152
01:01:09,888 --> 01:01:11,189
Sorry!

1153
01:01:43,421 --> 01:01:44,921
What happened?

1154
01:01:44,923 --> 01:01:47,990
What happened is
you destroyed my evidence.

1155
01:01:47,992 --> 01:01:49,759
What's going on?
What did I do?

1156
01:01:49,761 --> 01:01:51,227
What did you guys do to me?

1157
01:01:51,229 --> 01:01:54,997
That's right, punk.
Blame the system.

1158
01:01:54,999 --> 01:01:56,899
Your tracker worked
like a charm, Evelyn.

1159
01:01:56,901 --> 01:01:58,167
<i>You're a genius.</i>

1160
01:01:58,169 --> 01:01:59,068
Aw, shucks!

1161
01:01:59,070 --> 01:02:01,871
I'm just the genius
behind the genius.

1162
01:02:01,873 --> 01:02:04,240
Hey, Dad.

1163
01:02:04,242 --> 01:02:08,244
We're doing fractions
and denismals and percentages

1164
01:02:08,246 --> 01:02:09,312
and I don't get 'em.

1165
01:02:09,314 --> 01:02:10,446
Aren't you...

1166
01:02:10,448 --> 01:02:11,914
Didn't we get all caught up?

1167
01:02:11,916 --> 01:02:13,349
Yeah, we were caught up...

1168
01:02:13,351 --> 01:02:16,819
and now we're doing fractions
and percentages and demicels.

1169
01:02:16,821 --> 01:02:18,187
Decimals.

1170
01:02:18,189 --> 01:02:19,489
<i>...the
addition of the Incredibile,</i>

1171
01:02:19,491 --> 01:02:20,890
<i>the super car...</i>

1172
01:02:20,892 --> 01:02:23,259
<i>once driven by superhero,
Mr. Incredible.</i>

1173
01:02:23,261 --> 01:02:26,229
<i>It's the kind of thing you buy
when you have everything else.</i>

1174
01:02:26,231 --> 01:02:28,565
They said it was
beyond repair.

1175
01:02:28,567 --> 01:02:30,099
<i>Hey,
it was in perfect condition.</i>

1176
01:02:30,101 --> 01:02:31,901
You used to
drive that?

1177
01:02:31,903 --> 01:02:33,402
They said it was destroyed.

1178
01:02:33,404 --> 01:02:35,271
<i>Long thought lost
or destroyed,</i>

1179
01:02:35,273 --> 01:02:37,440
<i>the famous car
turned up at private auction.</i>

1180
01:02:37,442 --> 01:02:38,941
They said it was...

1181
01:02:38,943 --> 01:02:40,943
That's my car!

1182
01:02:48,853 --> 01:02:51,320
Stupid water feature!

1183
01:02:51,322 --> 01:02:54,090
<i>This car is just loaded
with amazing gadgets.</i>

1184
01:02:54,092 --> 01:02:55,258
<i>Care to demonstrate?</i>

1185
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:57,426
<i>I'd love to,
but we haven't figured out</i>

1186
01:02:57,428 --> 01:02:58,995
<i>how to make them work yet.</i>

1187
01:03:00,932 --> 01:03:04,068
Wow! It works?

1188
01:03:05,270 --> 01:03:06,536
Huh?

1189
01:03:06,538 --> 01:03:09,005
What are you doing?
This is not a toy!

1190
01:03:09,007 --> 01:03:10,273
That's a rocket launcher!

1191
01:03:10,275 --> 01:03:12,275
Sweet! Which one launches
the rocket?

1192
01:03:12,277 --> 01:03:14,010
Hey!
This is not your car!

1193
01:03:14,012 --> 01:03:15,344
It's not your car,
either!

1194
01:03:15,346 --> 01:03:17,146
It is so!
It's the Incredibile.

1195
01:03:17,148 --> 01:03:19,181
- Why's that guy have it?
- He shouldn't!

1196
01:03:19,183 --> 01:03:20,950
Launch the rockets!
Launch the rockets!

1197
01:03:20,952 --> 01:03:22,418
Launch the rockets!

1198
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:23,953
- I'm not launching anything!
- I wanna blow it up!

1199
01:03:23,955 --> 01:03:25,021
Do you think I want
an angry rich guy...

1200
01:03:25,023 --> 01:03:26,523
coming after me right now...

1201
01:03:26,525 --> 01:03:28,257
- when I'm trying not to...
- <i>I'm not sure</i>

1202
01:03:28,259 --> 01:03:29,325
- <i>what's happened here, Mark.</i>
- ...distract your mother.

1203
01:03:29,327 --> 01:03:31,027
<i>But everyone here
has scattered</i>

1204
01:03:31,029 --> 01:03:32,928
<i>and I'm afraid I'll need
to move at any minute.</i>

1205
01:03:32,930 --> 01:03:35,466
Rich guy got my car.

1206
01:03:37,335 --> 01:03:40,102
So, you're not gonna
steal your car

1207
01:03:40,104 --> 01:03:41,507
back from the rich guy?

1208
01:03:50,214 --> 01:03:52,281
What the heck is that?

1209
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:58,054
Jack-Jack has powers?

1210
01:03:58,056 --> 01:03:59,188
Well, yeah, but...

1211
01:03:59,190 --> 01:04:00,624
- You knew about this?
- Yeah.

1212
01:04:00,626 --> 01:04:02,458
- Why didn't you tell us?
- I don't know.

1213
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:04,994
We're your kids. We need
to know these things.

1214
01:04:04,996 --> 01:04:06,295
- Did you tell Mom?
- No.

1215
01:04:06,297 --> 01:04:08,197
- Why not?
- Your mother is not...

1216
01:04:08,199 --> 01:04:09,932
You'd want us to tell you,
wouldn't you?

1217
01:04:09,934 --> 01:04:11,267
- Why would you not tell Mom?
- Because I didn't wanna...

1218
01:04:11,269 --> 01:04:12,468
What?

1219
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:13,670
- Come on, man.
- Because it's not the time.

1220
01:04:13,672 --> 01:04:14,937
- Why?
- Because...

1221
01:04:14,939 --> 01:04:16,038
So uncool!

1222
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:18,174
Because I'm formulating, okay?

1223
01:04:18,176 --> 01:04:21,077
I'm taking in information,
I'm processing!

1224
01:04:21,079 --> 01:04:23,145
I'm doing the math,
I'm fixing the boyfriend...

1225
01:04:23,147 --> 01:04:24,380
and keeping the baby

1226
01:04:24,382 --> 01:04:25,615
from turning into
a flaming monster!

1227
01:04:25,617 --> 01:04:27,051
How do I do it?

1228
01:04:28,019 --> 01:04:30,186
By rolling with
the punches, baby!

1229
01:04:30,188 --> 01:04:32,922
I eat thunder
and crap lightning, okay?

1230
01:04:32,924 --> 01:04:34,491
'Cause I'm Mr. Incredible!

1231
01:04:34,493 --> 01:04:38,027
Not Mr. So-So
or Mr. Mediocre-Guy.

1232
01:04:38,029 --> 01:04:40,597
Mr. Incredible!

1233
01:04:42,233 --> 01:04:44,467
We should call Lucius.

1234
01:04:44,469 --> 01:04:46,135
No. I can handle it.

1235
01:04:46,137 --> 01:04:48,471
There's no way I'm gonna...

1236
01:04:57,549 --> 01:04:59,317
Dada.

1237
01:05:00,118 --> 01:05:02,251
I'm calling Lucius.

1238
01:05:05,524 --> 01:05:08,257
Looks normal to me. When
did this start happening?

1239
01:05:08,259 --> 01:05:10,292
Since Helen got the job.

1240
01:05:10,294 --> 01:05:12,228
- I assume she knows?
- Are you kidding?

1241
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:13,530
I can't tell her
about this,

1242
01:05:13,532 --> 01:05:15,064
not while she's doing
hero work!

1243
01:05:15,066 --> 01:05:16,365
Mama!

1244
01:05:16,367 --> 01:05:17,734
<i>Girls, come on.</i>

1245
01:05:17,736 --> 01:05:19,268
<i>Leave the saving the world
to the men?</i>

1246
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:20,637
- <i>I don't think so.</i>
- Mama!

1247
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:22,506
I've got to succeed!

1248
01:05:22,508 --> 01:05:24,206
So she can succeed.

1249
01:05:24,208 --> 01:05:26,676
- So we can succeed!
- I get it, Bob!

1250
01:05:26,678 --> 01:05:29,646
I get it. When was the
last time you slept?

1251
01:05:29,648 --> 01:05:31,480
Who keeps track of that?

1252
01:05:31,482 --> 01:05:33,048
Besides, he's a baby.

1253
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:35,418
I can handle it,
I got this handled.

1254
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:37,353
So, you good then?

1255
01:05:37,355 --> 01:05:39,756
You got everything
under control? Right?

1256
01:05:42,594 --> 01:05:44,026
What the...?

1257
01:05:45,129 --> 01:05:47,196
Cookie! Cha Cha want a cookie?

1258
01:05:47,198 --> 01:05:50,132
Num-num cookie?
Cha Cha wanna num-num?

1259
01:05:50,134 --> 01:05:53,002
Num-num cookie! Cookie!

1260
01:05:53,004 --> 01:05:54,170
- You're not...
- Cookie!

1261
01:05:54,172 --> 01:05:55,471
- Oh, my God!
- Cookie!

1262
01:05:55,473 --> 01:05:57,473
- Dada! Dada. Dada.
- Whoa.

1263
01:05:57,475 --> 01:05:59,275
Okay! Okay.

1264
01:05:59,277 --> 01:06:01,243
So, he can still
hear you from the...

1265
01:06:01,245 --> 01:06:03,279
From the other
dimension, yeah.

1266
01:06:03,281 --> 01:06:05,381
That is freaky.
I mean, that's not like...

1267
01:06:05,383 --> 01:06:08,417
Not like our other kids.
No, it is not.

1268
01:06:08,419 --> 01:06:11,120
Full powers, totally random.

1269
01:06:11,122 --> 01:06:13,456
So now, he's what?
Is he good?

1270
01:06:13,458 --> 01:06:15,592
Yeah, you'd think so,
right?

1271
01:06:15,594 --> 01:06:18,695
Obviously, I can't keep
giving him cookies!

1272
01:06:18,697 --> 01:06:20,664
- Uh-uh?
- But if I stop...

1273
01:06:24,235 --> 01:06:26,235
Ahhh! He is freaking!
Again, he is freaking!

1274
01:06:26,237 --> 01:06:27,737
No biting the daddy!

1275
01:06:27,739 --> 01:06:29,106
- What the...?
- No biting!

1276
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:37,114
Okay.

1277
01:06:38,517 --> 01:06:41,618
I think I just need
a little bit of me time.

1278
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:43,152
Then I'll be good to go.

1279
01:06:43,154 --> 01:06:45,321
Oh, you need
more than me time, Bob.

1280
01:06:45,323 --> 01:06:47,223
You need
major life realignment

1281
01:06:47,225 --> 01:06:48,457
on a number of levels.

1282
01:06:48,459 --> 01:06:51,227
Starting with
baby superfreak here!

1283
01:06:51,229 --> 01:06:55,099
You need some solid
outside-the-box thinking.

1284
01:07:03,642 --> 01:07:05,241
<i>Galbaki?</i>

1285
01:07:05,243 --> 01:07:09,311
<i>Elastigirl's supersuit
is by Galbaki?</i>

1286
01:07:09,313 --> 01:07:10,780
<i>Explain yourself!</i>

1287
01:07:13,819 --> 01:07:16,586
<i>Oh, my God.
You're worse than I thought.</i>

1288
01:07:16,588 --> 01:07:19,689
<i>It's the baby.
I brought the baby.</i>

1289
01:07:21,259 --> 01:07:23,529
<i>Oh, highly unusual.</i>

1290
01:07:30,869 --> 01:07:32,669
You look ghastly, Robert.

1291
01:07:32,671 --> 01:07:34,838
I haven't been sleeping.

1292
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:38,542
I broke my daughter,
they keep changing math...

1293
01:07:38,544 --> 01:07:41,611
we needed double-A batteries,
but I got triple-A's...

1294
01:07:41,613 --> 01:07:44,548
and now we still need
double-A batteries.

1295
01:07:44,550 --> 01:07:46,850
I put one red thing
in a load of whites

1296
01:07:46,852 --> 01:07:49,151
and now
everything's pink.

1297
01:07:49,153 --> 01:07:50,419
And I think
we need eggs.

1298
01:07:50,421 --> 01:07:54,189
Done properly,
parenting is a heroic act.

1299
01:07:54,191 --> 01:07:55,692
Done properly.

1300
01:07:55,694 --> 01:07:58,862
I am fortunate that it has
never afflicted me.

1301
01:07:58,864 --> 01:08:00,564
But you do not come to me

1302
01:08:00,566 --> 01:08:03,198
for eggs and batteries,
Robert.

1303
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,601
I design herowear

1304
01:08:04,603 --> 01:08:07,269
and Elastigirl
must have a new suit.

1305
01:08:07,271 --> 01:08:09,873
Actually,
it's Jack-Jack.

1306
01:08:09,875 --> 01:08:12,709
You also wish
a new suit for the baby?

1307
01:08:12,711 --> 01:08:16,746
I would hardly classify
this as an emergency.

1308
01:08:16,748 --> 01:08:19,516
Well, he's a special case.
Worth studying.

1309
01:08:19,518 --> 01:08:21,618
If I could just leave him
with you for a while...

1310
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:23,454
Leave him? Here?

1311
01:08:24,556 --> 01:08:26,690
I am not a baby person,
Robert.

1312
01:08:26,692 --> 01:08:29,659
I have no baby facilities.
I am an artist.

1313
01:08:29,661 --> 01:08:32,731
I do not involve myself in
the prosaic day-to-day to...

1314
01:08:33,699 --> 01:08:35,199
day.

1315
01:08:38,336 --> 01:08:40,304
Fascinating!

1316
01:08:42,741 --> 01:08:44,610
Are you seeing this, Robert?

1317
01:08:46,477 --> 01:08:47,613
Dada.

1318
01:08:56,555 --> 01:08:59,491
Oh, my God.

1319
01:09:00,424 --> 01:09:01,758
Yes!

1320
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:03,593
Of course you can leave
the baby overnight.

1321
01:09:03,595 --> 01:09:05,327
I'm sure filling in
for Helen is challenging,

1322
01:09:05,329 --> 01:09:06,529
and you are very tired...

1323
01:09:06,531 --> 01:09:07,631
and the other children
need you

1324
01:09:07,633 --> 01:09:09,331
and miss you,
and you must go to them.

1325
01:09:09,333 --> 01:09:10,767
Auntie Edna will take care
of everything...

1326
01:09:10,769 --> 01:09:13,572
so, drive safely and goodbye.
I enjoy our visits.

1327
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:17,907
"Auntie Edna"?

1328
01:09:22,413 --> 01:09:24,714
Attention. Attention.

1329
01:09:24,716 --> 01:09:27,383
I wanna thank everyone
that came out tonight...

1330
01:09:27,385 --> 01:09:28,785
in support of superheroes...

1331
01:09:28,787 --> 01:09:32,388
and bringing them
back into society!

1332
01:09:32,390 --> 01:09:33,990
You all made it happen.

1333
01:09:33,992 --> 01:09:35,424
The need for this
has been made

1334
01:09:35,426 --> 01:09:36,793
crystal clear
in recent days...

1335
01:09:36,795 --> 01:09:38,728
with bad actors
like the self-proclaimed

1336
01:09:38,730 --> 01:09:40,897
Screenslaver
threatening our peace.

1337
01:09:40,899 --> 01:09:42,499
His reign was short, huh?

1338
01:09:42,501 --> 01:09:44,601
And thanks to this woman...

1339
01:09:44,603 --> 01:09:47,771
a great super. You love her.
You missed her.

1340
01:09:47,773 --> 01:09:51,675
Welcome back, Elastigirl.

1341
01:09:51,677 --> 01:09:54,476
Come on up here.
Don't be bashful.

1342
01:09:54,478 --> 01:09:56,880
Come on. Get up here.

1343
01:09:56,882 --> 01:09:59,683
I want you to have this.

1344
01:09:59,685 --> 01:10:01,450
A memento.

1345
01:10:01,452 --> 01:10:04,821
Thanks, Winston, Evelyn,
and everyone at DEVTECH.

1346
01:10:04,823 --> 01:10:06,823
I am forever in your debt.

1347
01:10:06,825 --> 01:10:08,558
And thanks to all of you,

1348
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:11,661
your pressure
changed all the right minds.

1349
01:10:11,663 --> 01:10:13,963
We've made amazing headway
in a very short time...

1350
01:10:13,965 --> 01:10:17,433
which leads me to an
important announcement.

1351
01:10:17,435 --> 01:10:19,636
Just now,
at a worldwide summit...

1352
01:10:19,638 --> 01:10:21,538
leaders from
more than a hundred

1353
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:23,305
of the world's
top countries...

1354
01:10:23,307 --> 01:10:26,843
have agreed to make
superheroes legal again!

1355
01:10:28,647 --> 01:10:30,446
We'll gather superheroes
and leaders

1356
01:10:30,448 --> 01:10:31,648
from all over
the planet...

1357
01:10:31,650 --> 01:10:33,449
on our boat,
the <i>Everjust...</i>

1358
01:10:33,451 --> 01:10:36,820
for a televised
signing ceremony at sea.

1359
01:10:36,822 --> 01:10:40,724
Now if you'll excuse us,
we got a ship to catch!

1360
01:10:43,895 --> 01:10:46,295
So good to see you.
Thanks for coming out.

1361
01:10:46,297 --> 01:10:48,297
Hey.
Hi, it's me, again.

1362
01:10:48,299 --> 01:10:51,433
Um, there's, uh, something
I've always wanted to ask you.

1363
01:10:51,435 --> 01:10:54,003
Yeah, how do you balance
the superhero stuff

1364
01:10:54,005 --> 01:10:55,805
with the life stuff?

1365
01:10:55,807 --> 01:10:58,007
I know I can handle
the superhero stuff.

1366
01:11:00,912 --> 01:11:02,344
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Oh.

1367
01:11:02,346 --> 01:11:04,346
Would you please
excuse me a moment?

1368
01:11:04,348 --> 01:11:07,050
Oh. Yeah, okay, see you later!
Good talk!

1369
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:30,942
- Hey, Vi.
- Hey.

1370
01:11:32,010 --> 01:11:33,475
Where's Jack-Jack?

1371
01:11:33,477 --> 01:11:34,677
E's taking him
for a little bit.

1372
01:11:34,679 --> 01:11:37,446
- Edna is babysitting?
- Yeah.

1373
01:11:37,448 --> 01:11:39,516
And you're okay with this?

1374
01:11:39,518 --> 01:11:41,953
Yeah. I don't know why,
but yeah.

1375
01:11:43,855 --> 01:11:46,558
I wanted to say
something to you.

1376
01:11:47,592 --> 01:11:49,993
Sorry about Tony.

1377
01:11:49,995 --> 01:11:52,962
I didn't think about Dicker
erasing his memory...

1378
01:11:52,964 --> 01:11:56,633
or about you having to pay
the price for a choice...

1379
01:11:56,635 --> 01:12:00,570
you never made.
It's not fair, I know.

1380
01:12:00,572 --> 01:12:02,639
And then, I made it worse
at the restaurant

1381
01:12:02,641 --> 01:12:04,107
by trying to...

1382
01:12:04,109 --> 01:12:06,109
Anyway. Anyway...

1383
01:12:06,111 --> 01:12:07,977
I'm sorry.

1384
01:12:07,979 --> 01:12:09,546
I'm used to knowing

1385
01:12:09,548 --> 01:12:11,446
what the right thing
to do is...

1386
01:12:11,448 --> 01:12:14,617
but now,
I'm not sure anymore.

1387
01:12:14,619 --> 01:12:16,721
I just wanna be...

1388
01:12:18,957 --> 01:12:20,492
a good dad.

1389
01:12:24,129 --> 01:12:26,498
You're not good.

1390
01:12:28,432 --> 01:12:29,901
You're super.

1391
01:12:39,644 --> 01:12:42,612
Are superheroes allowed
to drink on duty?

1392
01:12:42,614 --> 01:12:45,748
I'm definitely not on duty.
Ignore the costume.

1393
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:47,884
I know
I should be up there...

1394
01:12:47,886 --> 01:12:50,086
but I had to step away from
the grip and grins, you know?

1395
01:12:50,088 --> 01:12:53,489
Gotta get away to keep it pure.
I know I do.

1396
01:12:53,491 --> 01:12:54,991
What are you getting
away from?

1397
01:12:54,993 --> 01:12:58,561
Eh, you know, company stuff.
My brother, mostly.

1398
01:12:58,563 --> 01:13:00,563
But you love him,
you two are this company.

1399
01:13:00,565 --> 01:13:01,931
Yin and yang.

1400
01:13:01,933 --> 01:13:04,067
Yeah, I invent the stuff,
he's good at people.

1401
01:13:04,069 --> 01:13:08,605
Pleasing them, engaging them,
figuring out what they want.

1402
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:10,740
I never know
what people want.

1403
01:13:10,742 --> 01:13:12,577
What do you think
they want?

1404
01:13:12,878 --> 01:13:13,943
Ease.

1405
01:13:13,945 --> 01:13:16,880
People will trade quality
for ease every time.

1406
01:13:16,882 --> 01:13:20,482
It may be crap,
but hey, it's convenient.

1407
01:13:20,484 --> 01:13:22,185
Yeah. Kind of
like this case.

1408
01:13:22,187 --> 01:13:23,519
What?
The Screenslaver?

1409
01:13:23,521 --> 01:13:25,221
Yeah, something's not
sitting right.

1410
01:13:25,223 --> 01:13:26,756
It was too easy.

1411
01:13:26,758 --> 01:13:29,527
That was too easy?
Wow.

1412
01:13:30,128 --> 01:13:32,161
- Funny.
- What?

1413
01:13:32,163 --> 01:13:33,763
Look at that.

1414
01:13:33,765 --> 01:13:37,901
One of Screenslaver's monitors
is tuned into my suit cam.

1415
01:13:37,903 --> 01:13:39,836
What?

1416
01:13:39,838 --> 01:13:41,971
Isn't the suit cam
closed circuit?

1417
01:13:41,973 --> 01:13:42,739
It is.

1418
01:13:42,741 --> 01:13:45,608
Then how come
Screenslaver has it?

1419
01:13:45,610 --> 01:13:47,076
Maybe he hacked it?

1420
01:13:47,078 --> 01:13:49,779
So, he's sophisticated enough
to do that...

1421
01:13:49,781 --> 01:13:52,548
but he has simple locks
on his doors?

1422
01:13:52,550 --> 01:13:54,584
Maybe he wanted you
to find him.

1423
01:13:54,586 --> 01:13:56,052
He wanted to get caught?

1424
01:13:56,054 --> 01:13:58,021
He wanted you to win.

1425
01:13:58,023 --> 01:14:00,523
That makes no sense.
He's a brilliant guy.

1426
01:14:00,525 --> 01:14:01,791
If he's smart enough
to conceive

1427
01:14:01,793 --> 01:14:03,259
of technology like this...

1428
01:14:03,261 --> 01:14:05,795
he's smart enough to think
of something to do with it.

1429
01:14:05,797 --> 01:14:07,931
The guy we put in jail
delivered pizzas.

1430
01:14:07,933 --> 01:14:08,898
So?

1431
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:10,700
Einstein was
a patent clerk.

1432
01:14:10,702 --> 01:14:12,835
Look, you won.
You got the guy who...

1433
01:14:12,837 --> 01:14:15,204
Wait. All Screenslaver
needs to do

1434
01:14:15,206 --> 01:14:16,606
to hypnotize someone...

1435
01:14:16,608 --> 01:14:18,708
is get a screen
in front of their eyes.

1436
01:14:18,710 --> 01:14:22,881
But what if the screen
doesn't look like a screen?

1437
01:14:25,083 --> 01:14:29,619
What if the pizza guy
is really a pizza guy...

1438
01:14:29,621 --> 01:14:30,920
but he was controlled
by the screens

1439
01:14:30,922 --> 01:14:32,090
built into his glasses...

1440
01:14:33,558 --> 01:14:35,593
You are good.

1441
01:14:39,664 --> 01:14:40,697
<i>Look, the robot!</i>

1442
01:14:40,699 --> 01:14:42,098
<i>It's taking off.</i>

1443
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:43,900
<i>I'm not getting
a reading yet.</i>

1444
01:14:43,902 --> 01:14:44,902
<i>- Press "fire"?
- Now!</i>

1445
01:14:47,939 --> 01:14:48,838
<i>More power.</i>

1446
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:51,808
<i>Oh, I hope
this works, Dad.</i>

1447
01:14:51,810 --> 01:14:54,711
I thought it was best
to just let you sleep.

1448
01:14:54,713 --> 01:14:57,647
Seventeen hours.

1449
01:14:57,649 --> 01:15:00,016
How do you feel?

1450
01:15:00,018 --> 01:15:01,117
Super.

1451
01:15:01,119 --> 01:15:04,087
<i>- You got it, Dad.
- Hurray!</i>

1452
01:15:04,089 --> 01:15:06,122
I can't tell you
how much I appreciate

1453
01:15:06,124 --> 01:15:08,191
you watching
Jack-Jack for me, E.

1454
01:15:08,193 --> 01:15:11,627
Yes, I'm sure your gratitude
is quite inexpressible.

1455
01:15:11,629 --> 01:15:13,262
Don't ask me
to do it again, darling.

1456
01:15:13,264 --> 01:15:14,864
My rates are far too high.

1457
01:15:14,866 --> 01:15:15,898
Oh, uh...

1458
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:18,334
I am joking, Robert.
I enjoyed the assignment.

1459
01:15:18,336 --> 01:15:20,269
He is bright
and I am stimulating.

1460
01:15:20,271 --> 01:15:22,305
We deserve each other.

1461
01:15:22,307 --> 01:15:24,674
Your child is a polymorph.

1462
01:15:24,676 --> 01:15:27,010
Like all babies,
he has enormous potential.

1463
01:15:27,012 --> 01:15:28,811
It is not unknown
for supers

1464
01:15:28,813 --> 01:15:30,646
to have more than one
power when young...

1465
01:15:30,648 --> 01:15:33,282
but this little one has many.

1466
01:15:33,284 --> 01:15:36,654
Yes, you have many powers.

1467
01:15:50,068 --> 01:15:52,301
I understand
your lack of sleep

1468
01:15:52,303 --> 01:15:53,770
and coherency, Robert.

1469
01:15:53,772 --> 01:15:55,238
Babies can be anything,

1470
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:56,906
and your child
is no exception.

1471
01:15:56,908 --> 01:15:59,809
He has pure,
unlimited potential, Robert.

1472
01:15:59,811 --> 01:16:02,879
He slept while I worked
in a creative fever.

1473
01:16:02,881 --> 01:16:05,281
Auntie Edna stayed up
all night...

1474
01:16:05,283 --> 01:16:08,051
making sure you look
fabulous in your many forms.

1475
01:16:08,053 --> 01:16:10,753
What are you... You're
putting him in the...

1476
01:16:10,755 --> 01:16:11,988
In the chamber, Robert.

1477
01:16:11,990 --> 01:16:13,790
He is part
of the demonstration

1478
01:16:13,792 --> 01:16:14,924
and will be fine.

1479
01:16:14,926 --> 01:16:16,926
Your challenge
is to manage a baby

1480
01:16:16,928 --> 01:16:18,694
who has
multiple powers...

1481
01:16:18,696 --> 01:16:21,831
and no control
over them, yes?

1482
01:16:21,833 --> 01:16:23,332
Huh. That sums it up.

1483
01:16:23,334 --> 01:16:24,867
I often work to music

1484
01:16:24,869 --> 01:16:27,804
and I noticed the baby
responds to it as well.

1485
01:16:27,806 --> 01:16:29,806
Specifically, Mozart.

1486
01:16:29,808 --> 01:16:31,307
I blended Kevlar

1487
01:16:31,309 --> 01:16:33,676
with carbyne for
durability under duress...

1488
01:16:33,678 --> 01:16:35,344
and cotton for comfort.

1489
01:16:35,346 --> 01:16:38,915
Interwoven with these fabrics
are a mesh of tiny sensors...

1490
01:16:38,917 --> 01:16:41,984
that monitor the baby's
physical properties.

1491
01:16:41,986 --> 01:16:45,021
Oh, Lord!
What is he doing?

1492
01:16:45,023 --> 01:16:48,091
Well, it's Mozart, Robert.
Can you blame him?

1493
01:16:48,093 --> 01:16:50,393
The important thing is that
the suit and tracker...

1494
01:16:50,395 --> 01:16:52,695
anticipated the change
and alerted you.

1495
01:16:52,697 --> 01:16:53,796
Oh, no. Cookies.

1496
01:16:53,798 --> 01:16:55,298
I gotta get cookies!

1497
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:57,266
You do not need cookies.

1498
01:16:57,268 --> 01:16:58,401
As I learned quite painfully

1499
01:16:58,403 --> 01:16:59,735
last night...

1500
01:16:59,737 --> 01:17:01,304
any solution involving cookies

1501
01:17:01,306 --> 01:17:04,373
will inevitably result
in the demon baby.

1502
01:17:06,277 --> 01:17:07,810
"Combustion imminent"?

1503
01:17:07,812 --> 01:17:09,045
What does that mean?

1504
01:17:09,948 --> 01:17:11,714
It means fire, Robert,

1505
01:17:11,716 --> 01:17:13,950
for which the suit
has countermeasures.

1506
01:17:13,952 --> 01:17:16,819
I suggest you extinguish
the baby's flames

1507
01:17:16,821 --> 01:17:18,923
before he trips
the sprinkler system.

1508
01:17:20,859 --> 01:17:22,692
The flame retardant

1509
01:17:22,694 --> 01:17:24,894
is blackberry lavender,
darling.

1510
01:17:24,896 --> 01:17:27,797
Effective, edible,
and delicious.

1511
01:17:27,799 --> 01:17:31,067
Well, what do you know?
That is useful.

1512
01:17:31,069 --> 01:17:33,970
Although, I have doubtlessly
exceeded your expectations

1513
01:17:33,972 --> 01:17:35,972
for a single night's work...

1514
01:17:35,974 --> 01:17:37,273
the suit
and device contain

1515
01:17:37,275 --> 01:17:39,475
a few more features
we need to discuss.

1516
01:17:39,477 --> 01:17:42,078
Thanks again, E,
for everything.

1517
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:43,813
How much
do I owe you for...

1518
01:17:43,815 --> 01:17:46,782
Pish-posh, darling. Your bill
will be covered by my fee...

1519
01:17:46,784 --> 01:17:48,885
for being Mr. Incredible,
Elastigirl,

1520
01:17:48,887 --> 01:17:51,287
and Frozone's
exclusive designer...

1521
01:17:51,289 --> 01:17:53,956
throughout the known universe
and until the end of time.

1522
01:17:53,958 --> 01:17:55,992
But babysitting this one...

1523
01:17:55,994 --> 01:17:59,030
I do for free, darling.

1524
01:18:16,447 --> 01:18:17,780
<i>I would resist</i>

1525
01:18:17,782 --> 01:18:19,081
<i>the temptation to stretch.</i>

1526
01:18:19,083 --> 01:18:22,185
<i>The temperature around you
is well below freezing.</i>

1527
01:18:22,187 --> 01:18:24,954
<i>Try to stretch
and you'll break.</i>

1528
01:18:24,956 --> 01:18:27,757
<i>So, you're
the Screenslaver.</i>

1529
01:18:27,759 --> 01:18:30,092
<i>Yes and no.</i>

1530
01:18:30,094 --> 01:18:32,895
Let's say,
I created the character

1531
01:18:32,897 --> 01:18:34,797
and pre-recorded
the messages.

1532
01:18:34,799 --> 01:18:36,165
<i>Does Winston know?</i>

1533
01:18:36,167 --> 01:18:39,101
That I'm the Screenslaver?
Of course not.

1534
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:41,538
Can you imagine
what Mr. Free Enterprise

1535
01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:43,339
would do
with my hypnosis technology?

1536
01:18:43,341 --> 01:18:45,007
<i>Worse than
what you're doing?</i>

1537
01:18:45,009 --> 01:18:47,143
<i>Hey, I'm using
the technology</i>

1538
01:18:47,145 --> 01:18:48,978
<i>to destroy
people's trust in it.</i>

1539
01:18:48,980 --> 01:18:51,414
Like I'm using superheroes.

1540
01:18:51,416 --> 01:18:52,982
<i>Who did I put in jail?</i>

1541
01:18:52,984 --> 01:18:54,250
<i>Pizza delivery guy.</i>

1542
01:18:54,252 --> 01:18:56,052
<i>Seemed the right height,
build.</i>

1543
01:18:56,054 --> 01:18:58,354
<i>He gave you
a pretty good fight.</i>

1544
01:18:58,356 --> 01:18:59,956
<i>I should say I gave you</i>

1545
01:18:59,958 --> 01:19:01,324
<i>a pretty good fight
through him.</i>

1546
01:19:01,326 --> 01:19:03,092
<i>But it doesn't
bother you</i>

1547
01:19:03,094 --> 01:19:04,994
<i>that an innocent man
is in jail?</i>

1548
01:19:04,996 --> 01:19:08,231
Eh, he was surly
and the pizza was cold.

1549
01:19:08,233 --> 01:19:09,966
I counted on you.

1550
01:19:09,968 --> 01:19:11,400
That's why you failed.

1551
01:19:11,402 --> 01:19:12,969
What?

1552
01:19:12,971 --> 01:19:15,505
<i>Why would you count on me?
Because I built you a bike?</i>

1553
01:19:15,507 --> 01:19:18,007
<i>Because my brother
knows the words</i>

1554
01:19:18,009 --> 01:19:19,108
<i>to your theme song?</i>

1555
01:19:19,110 --> 01:19:20,843
<i>We don't know each other.</i>

1556
01:19:20,845 --> 01:19:22,445
But you can
count on me anyway.

1557
01:19:22,447 --> 01:19:24,213
<i>I am supposed to,
aren't I?</i>

1558
01:19:24,215 --> 01:19:26,816
<i>Because you have
some strange abilities</i>

1559
01:19:26,818 --> 01:19:28,050
<i>and a shiny costume...</i>

1560
01:19:28,052 --> 01:19:30,487
<i>the rest of us are supposed
to put our lives</i>

1561
01:19:30,489 --> 01:19:32,522
<i>into your gloved hands.</i>

1562
01:19:32,524 --> 01:19:35,057
<i>That's what
my father believed.</i>

1563
01:19:35,059 --> 01:19:38,828
When our home was broken into,
my mother wanted to hide.

1564
01:19:38,830 --> 01:19:41,130
Begged my father
to use the safe room.

1565
01:19:41,132 --> 01:19:45,535
But Father insisted they call
his superhero friends.

1566
01:19:45,537 --> 01:19:50,339
He died,
pointlessly, stupidly...

1567
01:19:50,341 --> 01:19:53,009
waiting for heroes
to save the day.

1568
01:19:53,011 --> 01:19:54,410
<i>But why would you...</i>

1569
01:19:54,412 --> 01:19:56,080
- <i>Your brother...</i>
- Is a child!

1570
01:19:56,615 --> 01:19:58,281
<i>He remembers the time</i>

1571
01:19:58,283 --> 01:20:00,416
<i>when we had parents
and superheroes.</i>

1572
01:20:00,418 --> 01:20:04,353
<i>So, like a child,
Winston conflates the two.</i>

1573
01:20:04,355 --> 01:20:08,124
<i>Mommy and Daddy went away
because supers went away.</i>

1574
01:20:08,126 --> 01:20:10,893
<i>Our sweet parents
were fools</i>

1575
01:20:10,895 --> 01:20:12,995
<i>to put their lives
in anybody else's hands.</i>

1576
01:20:12,997 --> 01:20:15,166
<i>Superheroes keep us weak.</i>

1577
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:17,503
Are you gonna kill me?

1578
01:20:18,336 --> 01:20:19,337
Nah.

1579
01:20:21,372 --> 01:20:22,905
Using you is better.

1580
01:20:22,907 --> 01:20:25,908
You're gonna help me make
supers illegal...

1581
01:20:25,910 --> 01:20:27,378
forever.

1582
01:20:32,383 --> 01:20:34,052
Dada. Dada.

1583
01:20:34,919 --> 01:20:37,121
Ready?
Laser eyes.

1584
01:20:38,524 --> 01:20:39,589
Stop.

1585
01:20:39,591 --> 01:20:41,023
- Wow!
- Yeah!

1586
01:20:41,025 --> 01:20:42,291
- Yay, Jack-Jack!
- Yeah, baby!

1587
01:20:42,293 --> 01:20:43,560
And that's not all.
Watch this.

1588
01:20:43,562 --> 01:20:45,363
Jack-Jack, blaster ready?

1589
01:20:50,101 --> 01:20:52,201
- No way.
- That is crazy cool.

1590
01:20:52,203 --> 01:20:53,503
My turn.
I get to blast him first!

1591
01:20:53,505 --> 01:20:54,904
- Let me try. I want him.
- Give him to me.

1592
01:20:54,906 --> 01:20:56,339
Hey, I'm just demonstrating.

1593
01:20:56,341 --> 01:20:58,341
No firing the baby around
the house, you understand?

1594
01:20:58,343 --> 01:21:01,010
This is potentially
dangerous...

1595
01:21:01,012 --> 01:21:04,146
and we're trying to teach him
to control his powers, okay?

1596
01:21:04,148 --> 01:21:06,017
Stop. See the screen.

1597
01:21:08,019 --> 01:21:10,319
He vanished!
That's really cool!

1598
01:21:11,523 --> 01:21:13,089
Okay, good. Use the thing.

1599
01:21:13,091 --> 01:21:14,990
That's the current readout.
Click it. See the readout?

1600
01:21:14,992 --> 01:21:16,959
Dimension four.
See the shape?

1601
01:21:16,961 --> 01:21:18,928
That's the room.
See where he is in relation?

1602
01:21:18,930 --> 01:21:20,098
So, where is he?

1603
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:24,066
He's... there!

1604
01:21:24,068 --> 01:21:26,104
Okay. Come out.
Num-num cookie?

1605
01:21:27,972 --> 01:21:29,305
- Yay, Jack-Jack!
- Yeah, Jack-Jack!

1606
01:21:29,307 --> 01:21:31,242
That's really cool.

1607
01:21:37,482 --> 01:21:39,949
- Hello?
- Elastigirl's in trouble.

1608
01:21:39,951 --> 01:21:41,250
What? What happened to her?

1609
01:21:41,252 --> 01:21:42,952
Sorry to tell you
on the phone.

1610
01:21:42,954 --> 01:21:44,387
Meet me on our ship
at DEVTECH.

1611
01:21:44,389 --> 01:21:46,556
The ship at DEVTECH.
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

1612
01:21:46,558 --> 01:21:48,991
What's at the ship
at DEVTECH?

1613
01:21:48,993 --> 01:21:50,527
Lucius? Bob.
Helen's in trouble.

1614
01:21:50,529 --> 01:21:52,261
I need someone
to watch the kids.

1615
01:21:52,263 --> 01:21:53,963
<i>Suit up. It might get weird.</i>

1616
01:21:53,965 --> 01:21:55,532
I'll be there.
ASAP. Fifteen tops.

1617
01:21:55,534 --> 01:21:57,534
Where are you
going ASAP?

1618
01:21:57,536 --> 01:21:59,168
You better be back ASAP!

1619
01:21:59,170 --> 01:22:00,403
And leaving that suit.

1620
01:22:00,405 --> 01:22:02,204
I gotta go.
I'll be home soon.

1621
01:22:02,206 --> 01:22:03,540
Lucius will be here sooner.

1622
01:22:03,542 --> 01:22:05,709
No firing the baby
around the house, okay?

1623
01:22:05,711 --> 01:22:07,476
What's at the ship
at DEVTECH?

1624
01:22:07,478 --> 01:22:10,014
And why are you
in your Supersuit?

1625
01:22:22,026 --> 01:22:23,426
Is that Mom's supersuit?

1626
01:22:23,428 --> 01:22:25,461
She may need it.
You never know.

1627
01:22:25,463 --> 01:22:27,163
What's going on?

1628
01:22:27,165 --> 01:22:29,165
I don't know,
but Dad called Lucius

1629
01:22:29,167 --> 01:22:31,167
after getting a call
about Mom...

1630
01:22:31,169 --> 01:22:32,435
and then left.

1631
01:22:32,437 --> 01:22:34,203
I thought you renounced
superheroes.

1632
01:22:34,205 --> 01:22:37,440
Yeah, well,
I renounce my renunciation.

1633
01:22:37,442 --> 01:22:38,544
Put that on.

1634
01:22:49,688 --> 01:22:52,421
Hello there, little fella.

1635
01:22:52,423 --> 01:22:54,056
Hello.

1636
01:22:54,058 --> 01:22:55,291
You kids aren't safe.

1637
01:22:55,293 --> 01:22:56,526
The Deavors sent us
to take you...

1638
01:22:56,528 --> 01:22:59,395
Well,
isn't that redundant?

1639
01:22:59,397 --> 01:23:02,366
The Deavors just sent me here
to guard the house.

1640
01:23:04,670 --> 01:23:07,403
'Cause the kids aren't safe.

1641
01:23:07,405 --> 01:23:09,371
I get it,
managerial screw-up.

1642
01:23:09,373 --> 01:23:10,807
Tell Winston
I handled it.

1643
01:23:10,809 --> 01:23:12,475
You understand,
Ms...

1644
01:23:12,477 --> 01:23:13,743
Voyd.

1645
01:23:13,745 --> 01:23:15,346
Ms. Voyd.

1646
01:23:16,582 --> 01:23:17,582
Drive safely.

1647
01:23:27,358 --> 01:23:31,393
The thing is, he wants us
to bring you, too.

1648
01:23:31,395 --> 01:23:32,496
Hey.

1649
01:23:34,098 --> 01:23:35,501
That isn't gonna
hold them long.

1650
01:23:36,602 --> 01:23:38,234
Dash, grab the baby!

1651
01:23:41,072 --> 01:23:42,240
Spread out!

1652
01:23:44,375 --> 01:23:45,407
- Whoa!
- Oh!

1653
01:23:45,409 --> 01:23:47,311
Dash!

1654
01:23:48,112 --> 01:23:49,515
We gotta get to my car.

1655
01:23:58,790 --> 01:24:00,857
What? What's going on?

1656
01:24:00,859 --> 01:24:02,260
Little fella!

1657
01:24:20,712 --> 01:24:22,378
It worked!

1658
01:24:28,119 --> 01:24:29,655
Incredibile, windows down!

1659
01:24:31,523 --> 01:24:32,524
Dive in!

1660
01:24:39,230 --> 01:24:41,698
Incredibile,
set voice identification.

1661
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:43,232
Loudly, say your names.

1662
01:24:43,234 --> 01:24:46,503
- Violet Parr.
- Dashiell Robert Parr.

1663
01:24:50,474 --> 01:24:51,541
Lucius!

1664
01:24:51,543 --> 01:24:53,579
Incredibile, escape!

1665
01:25:01,820 --> 01:25:03,319
Fill me in!

1666
01:25:03,321 --> 01:25:05,220
Good news and bad news.
We found her.

1667
01:25:05,222 --> 01:25:06,590
She seems physically fine

1668
01:25:06,592 --> 01:25:08,290
but she's had an encounter
with Screenslaver...

1669
01:25:08,292 --> 01:25:10,596
and she's acting
kind of strange. In here.

1670
01:25:14,332 --> 01:25:15,599
Strange how?

1671
01:25:23,875 --> 01:25:25,209
Helen?

1672
01:25:25,844 --> 01:25:27,546
Helen, what are you...

1673
01:25:36,220 --> 01:25:37,754
Helen, it's me.

1674
01:25:54,438 --> 01:25:56,508
Incredibile, pull over.

1675
01:26:00,979 --> 01:26:03,913
We can't go to E's.

1676
01:26:03,915 --> 01:26:06,482
You saw those goggles
they put on Lucius.

1677
01:26:06,484 --> 01:26:08,450
They were
wearing them, too.

1678
01:26:08,452 --> 01:26:11,286
They're all under
someone's control.

1679
01:26:11,288 --> 01:26:13,792
They've probably done
the same to Mom.

1680
01:26:15,292 --> 01:26:17,459
Okay. Bad guys after us.

1681
01:26:17,461 --> 01:26:19,261
No Mom, no Dad.

1682
01:26:19,263 --> 01:26:20,462
No Lucius.

1683
01:26:20,464 --> 01:26:24,301
But we have our powers,
this car...

1684
01:26:24,970 --> 01:26:28,538
and... what?

1685
01:26:40,585 --> 01:26:43,488
Incredibile,
take us to DEVTECH.

1686
01:26:46,658 --> 01:26:49,025
<i>The kids have escaped
in a tricked-out car,</i>

1687
01:26:49,027 --> 01:26:50,560
<i>but we got Frozone.</i>

1688
01:26:50,562 --> 01:26:53,565
Bring him to the ship
at DEVTECH immediately.

1689
01:26:58,904 --> 01:27:01,004
Aw, we missed 'em!

1690
01:27:01,006 --> 01:27:05,610
Oh, I wish the Incredibile
could follow that boat.

1691
01:27:08,312 --> 01:27:09,846
- What did you do?
- I don't know.

1692
01:27:09,848 --> 01:27:12,816
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything!

1693
01:27:20,458 --> 01:27:23,662
Wow, this car does
anything I say.

1694
01:27:31,335 --> 01:27:33,069
We didn't plan this well.

1695
01:27:33,071 --> 01:27:34,738
What do you mean?
We're here, aren't we?

1696
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:36,338
Yes, we're here.

1697
01:27:36,340 --> 01:27:38,744
We need to be up there.

1698
01:27:39,711 --> 01:27:40,877
Hey...

1699
01:27:40,879 --> 01:27:45,347
What if the Incredibile
has ejector seats?

1700
01:27:45,349 --> 01:27:46,750
Wait, what? No.

1701
01:27:46,752 --> 01:27:48,485
- Yeah, baby!
- No, don't say any more...

1702
01:27:48,487 --> 01:27:49,953
Max power! Launch!

1703
01:27:57,428 --> 01:27:59,394
Come on.

1704
01:28:01,933 --> 01:28:03,600
Hello!
Glad you could come.

1705
01:28:03,602 --> 01:28:05,570
Welcome to the conference.

1706
01:28:15,914 --> 01:28:17,714
Our stars, where are they?

1707
01:28:17,716 --> 01:28:19,015
<i>The event's about to start.</i>

1708
01:28:19,017 --> 01:28:21,050
They didn't want to upstage
the others.

1709
01:28:21,052 --> 01:28:23,553
<i>They'll join for the signing.</i>

1710
01:28:23,555 --> 01:28:26,055
Welcome, guests!
You're in for a treat.

1711
01:28:26,057 --> 01:28:30,693
This ship is the largest
hydrofoil on the planet.

1712
01:28:30,695 --> 01:28:31,828
So, hold onto something...

1713
01:28:31,830 --> 01:28:34,633
because we're going
to open her up!

1714
01:28:52,818 --> 01:28:55,485
We need to find Mom and Dad.
Stay here.

1715
01:28:55,487 --> 01:28:56,686
I'm gonna search for them.

1716
01:28:56,688 --> 01:28:59,122
Wait! Who's gonna
watch Jack-Jack?

1717
01:28:59,124 --> 01:29:01,157
Suck it up.
I won't be long.

1718
01:29:01,159 --> 01:29:03,827
Wait. Wait, but, but wait!

1719
01:29:03,829 --> 01:29:06,629
This is important.
They are in trouble.

1720
01:29:06,631 --> 01:29:09,566
It's up to us.
To us, understand?

1721
01:29:09,568 --> 01:29:12,469
Keep him amused but quiet!

1722
01:29:13,672 --> 01:29:14,706
Ugh.

1723
01:29:24,516 --> 01:29:26,551
Shh! Quiet!

1724
01:29:27,451 --> 01:29:28,620
Huh?

1725
01:29:32,858 --> 01:29:33,859
Jack-Jack?

1726
01:29:43,702 --> 01:29:45,737
Jack-Jack?
Jack-Jack!

1727
01:30:19,004 --> 01:30:19,869
Jack-Jack!

1728
01:30:19,871 --> 01:30:21,771
The mesmerized supers
know we're here...

1729
01:30:21,773 --> 01:30:24,741
but I found Mom and Dad...
Where's Jack-Jack?

1730
01:30:24,743 --> 01:30:27,911
You lost him?
I gave you one thing to do!

1731
01:30:27,913 --> 01:30:29,681
The tracker.
Use the tracker.

1732
01:30:33,585 --> 01:30:34,784
He's going up?

1733
01:30:34,786 --> 01:30:36,955
- He's in an elevator.
- Let's go!

1734
01:30:38,890 --> 01:30:41,557
Hey, little baby.
Where are your parents?

1735
01:30:44,095 --> 01:30:46,062
And here they are, folks!

1736
01:30:46,064 --> 01:30:48,965
The supers who started
this whole thing.

1737
01:30:48,967 --> 01:30:50,967
<i>I told you
they'd be there in time.</i>

1738
01:30:50,969 --> 01:30:53,670
Hey, did you make them
new masks?

1739
01:30:53,672 --> 01:30:55,638
Yeah. Night vision,
et cetera...

1740
01:30:55,640 --> 01:30:57,006
They look good, right?

1741
01:30:57,008 --> 01:30:58,775
<i>So simple,
even he can do it.</i>

1742
01:30:58,777 --> 01:31:02,779
And we're back live in
three, two, one...

1743
01:31:02,781 --> 01:31:04,547
This is
a momentous occasion.

1744
01:31:04,549 --> 01:31:06,182
We've all managed
to accomplish

1745
01:31:06,184 --> 01:31:09,686
something extraordinarily rare
in today's world.

1746
01:31:09,688 --> 01:31:11,554
We agree on something.

1747
01:31:14,626 --> 01:31:17,727
<i>We agree to undo
a bad decision.</i>

1748
01:31:17,729 --> 01:31:19,028
<i>To make sure</i>

1749
01:31:19,030 --> 01:31:20,930
<i>a few extraordinarily
gifted members...</i>

1750
01:31:20,932 --> 01:31:23,733
<i>of the world's many countries
are treated fairly.</i>

1751
01:31:23,735 --> 01:31:27,103
<i>To invite them once again
to use their gifts...</i>

1752
01:31:27,105 --> 01:31:28,604
<i>to benefit the world.</i>

1753
01:31:28,606 --> 01:31:30,106
I thank all of you

1754
01:31:30,108 --> 01:31:32,976
for representing your nation's
commitment to superheroes.

1755
01:31:32,978 --> 01:31:35,545
With special thanks
to Ambassador Selick.

1756
01:31:35,547 --> 01:31:37,246
Yeah, it's okay.
Let her hear you.

1757
01:31:37,248 --> 01:31:38,715
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

1758
01:31:38,717 --> 01:31:40,016
Thank you,
Ambassador,

1759
01:31:40,018 --> 01:31:42,151
for your early
and very crucial support.

1760
01:31:42,153 --> 01:31:44,887
I can't think of anyone
more deserving than you...

1761
01:31:44,889 --> 01:31:46,723
to be the first signature

1762
01:31:46,725 --> 01:31:49,861
on the International
Superhero Accord.

1763
01:31:50,895 --> 01:31:52,998
There it is!

1764
01:32:06,711 --> 01:32:08,611
Holy cow!

1765
01:32:08,613 --> 01:32:10,982
I know he's on fire.
Just put him out.

1766
01:32:17,622 --> 01:32:19,624
They're coming.

1767
01:32:28,833 --> 01:32:30,299
Is it okay
to give him that?

1768
01:32:30,301 --> 01:32:33,269
I wasn't hearing
any better ideas.

1769
01:32:57,328 --> 01:32:59,062
No!

1770
01:32:59,064 --> 01:33:00,797
Come on, Jack-Jack.

1771
01:33:00,799 --> 01:33:02,065
We have to go.

1772
01:33:02,067 --> 01:33:03,201
Cookie num-num?

1773
01:33:15,814 --> 01:33:18,648
- Mama, Mama.
- I see him. He's getting away!

1774
01:33:18,650 --> 01:33:19,951
Stand back.

1775
01:33:23,855 --> 01:33:26,024
- Darn it!
- He's heading for Mom.

1776
01:33:28,393 --> 01:33:31,828
It is done.
The world is super again.

1777
01:33:37,102 --> 01:33:39,769
Group photo. Come on.
Group photo, everyone.

1778
01:33:39,771 --> 01:33:42,705
Squeeze in. That's it.
Historic occasion.

1779
01:33:42,707 --> 01:33:44,175
Everyone, smile.

1780
01:33:50,849 --> 01:33:52,815
Go on phase two.

1781
01:33:52,817 --> 01:33:55,218
<i>Years of mandated
hiding and silence</i>

1782
01:33:55,220 --> 01:33:56,853
have made us bitter.

1783
01:33:56,855 --> 01:33:58,721
You bring us out
into the light...

1784
01:33:58,723 --> 01:34:00,022
<i>only to clean up the messes</i>

1785
01:34:00,024 --> 01:34:02,091
<i>your lack
of discipline creates.</i>

1786
01:34:02,093 --> 01:34:04,727
<i>Your bodies
and your character are weak.</i>

1787
01:34:04,729 --> 01:34:08,397
<i>Your promises are empty,
and you will pay for it.</i>

1788
01:34:08,399 --> 01:34:10,266
<i>We no longer serve you.</i>

1789
01:34:10,268 --> 01:34:11,868
<i>We serve only us.</i>

1790
01:34:11,870 --> 01:34:13,905
<i>May the fittest survive.</i>

1791
01:34:16,274 --> 01:34:17,306
<i>Well, we, um...</i>

1792
01:34:17,308 --> 01:34:20,076
<i>Some very alarming
moments there...</i>

1793
01:34:20,078 --> 01:34:22,879
<i>before the, uh,
technical difficulties.</i>

1794
01:34:22,881 --> 01:34:24,282
<i>Please bear with us.</i>

1795
01:34:37,295 --> 01:34:38,961
What?

1796
01:34:38,963 --> 01:34:40,463
Mayday! Mayday!
Mayday!

1797
01:34:40,465 --> 01:34:42,031
Hold! Let him talk.

1798
01:34:42,033 --> 01:34:44,033
Superheroes have forcibly
taken the bridge. Repeat.

1799
01:34:44,035 --> 01:34:45,035
Now.

1800
01:34:56,214 --> 01:34:57,813
A little further.

1801
01:34:57,815 --> 01:34:59,851
<i>Little further. Stop.</i>

1802
01:35:05,423 --> 01:35:07,990
What the... A baby?

1803
01:35:07,992 --> 01:35:10,028
Mom and Dad.
Uncle Lucius?

1804
01:35:12,463 --> 01:35:14,197
- My mama.
- Jack-Jack, no!

1805
01:35:17,235 --> 01:35:19,070
A super baby?

1806
01:35:23,908 --> 01:35:25,341
No, no, no!

1807
01:35:25,343 --> 01:35:26,344
<i>Put him down!</i>

1808
01:35:28,146 --> 01:35:29,812
- Grab her!
- No!

1809
01:35:29,814 --> 01:35:30,982
Hold Jack-Jack.

1810
01:35:39,190 --> 01:35:41,123
No!

1811
01:35:41,125 --> 01:35:42,992
Hey, it's me!

1812
01:35:42,994 --> 01:35:44,393
Yeah, that's what
I thought last time.

1813
01:35:44,395 --> 01:35:47,298
Kids, what are you...

1814
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:51,501
You came for us?

1815
01:35:51,503 --> 01:35:52,868
Don't be mad.

1816
01:35:52,870 --> 01:35:55,340
Oh, sweetie,
how could I be mad?

1817
01:35:56,241 --> 01:35:58,542
I'm proud.

1818
01:35:58,544 --> 01:36:00,409
Not to break up
a tender moment,

1819
01:36:00,411 --> 01:36:01,911
but where are we?

1820
01:36:01,913 --> 01:36:03,379
Is this DEVTECH's ship?

1821
01:36:03,381 --> 01:36:05,381
Evelyn Deavor
controls the Screenslaver...

1822
01:36:05,383 --> 01:36:08,184
and until a second ago, us.

1823
01:36:08,186 --> 01:36:10,253
Where's the crew?

1824
01:36:10,255 --> 01:36:12,455
<i>Collision detected.
Correct course.</i>

1825
01:36:12,457 --> 01:36:13,856
Uh-oh.
Did I do that?

1826
01:36:13,858 --> 01:36:17,061
Mom, the suit?
Try this.

1827
01:36:19,264 --> 01:36:21,933
Phase Three.
Go on Phase Three!

1828
01:36:25,103 --> 01:36:27,470
Why are the kids here?
You didn't go to the house?

1829
01:36:27,472 --> 01:36:28,871
I went to the house.

1830
01:36:28,873 --> 01:36:30,239
You didn't escape?
How did you not escape?

1831
01:36:30,241 --> 01:36:32,441
Hey!
We just saved you!

1832
01:36:32,443 --> 01:36:34,511
Escape? Escape from who?

1833
01:36:37,415 --> 01:36:38,449
Those guys!

1834
01:36:41,152 --> 01:36:43,886
What the...?
Jack-Jack has powers?

1835
01:36:43,888 --> 01:36:46,022
We know.
Fight now, talk later.

1836
01:37:19,190 --> 01:37:20,923
Jack-Jack.

1837
01:37:20,925 --> 01:37:22,258
Laser eyes!

1838
01:37:32,036 --> 01:37:33,235
Ah-ha!

1839
01:37:43,948 --> 01:37:45,149
Ugh.

1840
01:37:50,088 --> 01:37:52,121
Come with me, Winston.

1841
01:37:52,123 --> 01:37:54,090
- Did I faint?
- You'll be safe here.

1842
01:37:54,092 --> 01:37:56,094
Safe? Safe from what?

1843
01:37:57,195 --> 01:37:59,462
Where are the diplomats?
The supers?

1844
01:37:59,464 --> 01:38:00,597
Still hypnotized.

1845
01:38:00,599 --> 01:38:03,101
What have you done?

1846
01:38:07,238 --> 01:38:09,438
Evelyn, she's escaping.

1847
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:10,473
Well, go after her.

1848
01:38:10,475 --> 01:38:11,273
Finish your mission.

1849
01:38:11,275 --> 01:38:13,976
I can't just go!
What about the kids?

1850
01:38:13,978 --> 01:38:16,580
- Jack-Jack, who's gonna...
- Mom!

1851
01:38:16,582 --> 01:38:18,449
Go. We've got this.

1852
01:38:20,218 --> 01:38:22,118
Voyd, come with me.

1853
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:23,520
I'll go shut down
the engine.

1854
01:38:23,522 --> 01:38:25,187
I'll try to slow the
ship from the bow.

1855
01:38:25,189 --> 01:38:28,124
Wait, someone's missing.
Where's the crusher guy?

1856
01:38:28,126 --> 01:38:29,994
Strap in now!

1857
01:38:45,343 --> 01:38:47,011
It's for your own good.

1858
01:38:47,311 --> 01:38:49,011
No!

1859
01:38:49,013 --> 01:38:50,346
This is.

1860
01:39:01,426 --> 01:39:04,061
- We're too late.
- Get me up to the jet.

1861
01:39:28,019 --> 01:39:30,754
Hey, you did this.
Can you undo it?

1862
01:39:30,756 --> 01:39:33,088
You want me to un-crush?

1863
01:39:33,090 --> 01:39:34,724
What? No one's ever
asked for that?

1864
01:39:34,726 --> 01:39:37,727
No. To un-crush is silly.
Why un-crush?

1865
01:39:37,729 --> 01:39:39,328
To get into the engine room.

1866
01:39:39,330 --> 01:39:40,564
Oh, forget it.
We don't have enough time.

1867
01:39:40,566 --> 01:39:43,132
What if I said
to un-punch someone?

1868
01:39:43,134 --> 01:39:44,302
What do you do?

1869
01:39:48,039 --> 01:39:49,573
Welcome aboard, Elastigirl.

1870
01:39:49,575 --> 01:39:51,273
<i>Although
we haven't yet reached</i>

1871
01:39:51,275 --> 01:39:52,611
<i>our cruising altitude...</i>

1872
01:39:54,145 --> 01:39:56,513
feel free to roam about
the cabin.

1873
01:39:56,515 --> 01:39:59,181
Or just relax...

1874
01:39:59,183 --> 01:40:02,153
<i>and let the cabin roam
about you.</i>

1875
01:40:11,095 --> 01:40:13,095
I can't get
to the engine room!

1876
01:40:13,097 --> 01:40:14,498
We gotta do something!

1877
01:40:14,500 --> 01:40:16,165
Because trying to
slow it down ain't working.

1878
01:40:16,167 --> 01:40:18,100
Hey! What about
turning the boat?

1879
01:40:18,102 --> 01:40:19,301
The steering's
been destroyed!

1880
01:40:19,303 --> 01:40:22,104
- Dash means from the outside!
- Yeah!

1881
01:40:22,106 --> 01:40:23,205
If we break off
one of the foils

1882
01:40:23,207 --> 01:40:24,373
and turn the rudder...

1883
01:40:24,375 --> 01:40:26,743
we can veer the ship
away from the city!

1884
01:40:26,745 --> 01:40:28,210
That might work.

1885
01:40:28,212 --> 01:40:29,345
I'll turn the front,
you turn the rear.

1886
01:40:29,347 --> 01:40:31,447
Using the rudder?
That's underwater.

1887
01:40:31,449 --> 01:40:32,716
How am I supposed to get...

1888
01:40:32,718 --> 01:40:34,618
All right.
Come on, kids.

1889
01:40:34,620 --> 01:40:37,654
Dad, I know
this is going to work.

1890
01:40:37,656 --> 01:40:40,189
But if it doesn't,
and we crash...

1891
01:40:40,191 --> 01:40:43,593
my shields are probably better
protection than the ship.

1892
01:40:43,595 --> 01:40:47,265
I should stay here.
With Jack-Jack.

1893
01:40:47,799 --> 01:40:49,298
That's my girl.

1894
01:40:49,300 --> 01:40:51,737
Remember, Bob,
we're both turning right!

1895
01:40:58,409 --> 01:41:00,411
You know what's sad?

1896
01:41:03,682 --> 01:41:05,582
If it weren't
for your core beliefs...

1897
01:41:05,584 --> 01:41:08,319
I think we could have
been good friends.

1898
01:41:09,320 --> 01:41:11,289
At least...

1899
01:41:12,223 --> 01:41:14,258
I have core beliefs.

1900
01:41:15,694 --> 01:41:17,159
<i>We have breaking news...</i>

1901
01:41:17,161 --> 01:41:19,295
<i>While there is
still no radio contact,</i>

1902
01:41:19,297 --> 01:41:20,830
<i>the ship
has changed direction...</i>

1903
01:41:20,832 --> 01:41:22,131
<i>and is heading towards land</i>

1904
01:41:22,133 --> 01:41:23,502
<i>at a high rate of speed.</i>

1905
01:41:27,773 --> 01:41:29,307
So, Dash...

1906
01:41:30,441 --> 01:41:31,908
I am going to the rudder.

1907
01:41:31,910 --> 01:41:35,210
Once I turn the ship,
you hit the pull up button.

1908
01:41:35,212 --> 01:41:37,179
- Okay, Dad.
- Now lower me down...

1909
01:41:41,319 --> 01:41:44,621
The reputations of
superheroes are ruined.

1910
01:41:44,623 --> 01:41:48,192
You will never
become legal. Ever.

1911
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:49,793
Never?

1912
01:41:49,795 --> 01:41:51,360
No.

1913
01:41:51,362 --> 01:41:53,429
- Ever?
- No.

1914
01:41:53,431 --> 01:41:56,733
Not even a little
smidgee-widgee?

1915
01:41:56,735 --> 01:41:58,200
Oh, hypoxia.

1916
01:41:58,202 --> 01:41:59,836
When you don't have
enough oxygen,

1917
01:41:59,838 --> 01:42:02,206
things seem really silly.

1918
01:42:08,446 --> 01:42:10,513
Things get sillier

1919
01:42:10,515 --> 01:42:12,616
and sillier
and then you die.

1920
01:42:12,618 --> 01:42:14,584
I don't wanna die.

1921
01:42:14,586 --> 01:42:16,521
Ah, nobody does.

1922
01:42:17,288 --> 01:42:18,521
Really.

1923
01:42:18,523 --> 01:42:20,759
Not such
a bad way to go.

1924
01:42:39,578 --> 01:42:41,678
Everyone, we need to get
to the back of the ship.

1925
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:44,415
All supers,
protect your ambassadors!

1926
01:42:45,249 --> 01:42:46,618
Follow.

1927
01:42:49,588 --> 01:42:51,788
Dad's been underwater
for too long.

1928
01:42:59,831 --> 01:43:01,463
We gotta pull him up.

1929
01:43:01,465 --> 01:43:02,868
Wait. It's too soon.

1930
01:43:16,948 --> 01:43:18,581
I'm gonna press the button!

1931
01:43:18,583 --> 01:43:19,584
Not yet!

1932
01:43:34,465 --> 01:43:36,434
It's turning. It's working.

1933
01:43:40,005 --> 01:43:42,339
- Now!
- Dash, now!

1934
01:43:45,309 --> 01:43:46,712
Save yourself. Make a chute.

1935
01:43:49,014 --> 01:43:51,047
Make a chute. Make a chute.

1936
01:43:51,049 --> 01:43:52,582
Make a chute!

1937
01:43:54,786 --> 01:43:56,822
Helen!
Brace yourselves!

1938
01:44:04,963 --> 01:44:06,698
Crash positions!

1939
01:44:25,316 --> 01:44:26,549
Whoo.

1940
01:44:26,551 --> 01:44:29,855
I missed
Jack-Jack's first power?

1941
01:44:30,756 --> 01:44:33,388
Actually, you missed
the first 17.

1942
01:44:33,390 --> 01:44:34,991
Oh!

1943
01:44:46,738 --> 01:44:51,406
The fact that you saved me
doesn't make you right.

1944
01:44:51,408 --> 01:44:53,375
But it does make you alive.

1945
01:44:53,377 --> 01:44:55,344
And I'm grateful
for that.

1946
01:44:55,346 --> 01:44:58,380
I'm sorry,
but she'll go to prison.

1947
01:44:58,382 --> 01:45:00,016
Well, I'm sorry she's rich

1948
01:45:00,018 --> 01:45:02,384
and will probably get no more
than a slap on the wrist.

1949
01:45:02,386 --> 01:45:04,988
First of all, Violet,
I like you.

1950
01:45:04,990 --> 01:45:07,857
And who knows what the
future may bring...

1951
01:45:07,859 --> 01:45:11,628
but I have a good feeling
about all of you.

1952
01:45:11,630 --> 01:45:13,096
Hmm. Good feeling.

1953
01:45:13,098 --> 01:45:14,864
Should we be worried?

1954
01:45:14,866 --> 01:45:17,634
You guys got the next shift.
I'm beat. Oh!

1955
01:45:17,636 --> 01:45:19,602
I saw what you did back there.
That was incredible!

1956
01:45:19,604 --> 01:45:20,837
No pun intended.

1957
01:45:20,839 --> 01:45:22,572
Sorry I had
to punch you.

1958
01:45:24,142 --> 01:45:27,679
Yeah, baby! My sweet ride!

1959
01:45:39,825 --> 01:45:43,458
And in recognition
of the extraordinary service

1960
01:45:43,460 --> 01:45:44,661
they have demonstrated...

1961
01:45:44,663 --> 01:45:47,130
the legal status
of superheroes

1962
01:45:47,132 --> 01:45:49,464
is hereby restored.

1963
01:45:58,442 --> 01:46:00,442
You don't know me,
do you?

1964
01:46:00,444 --> 01:46:01,811
No, I don't...

1965
01:46:01,813 --> 01:46:02,979
Wait.

1966
01:46:02,981 --> 01:46:05,081
Are you the girl
with the water?

1967
01:46:05,083 --> 01:46:07,584
I'm Violet Parr.

1968
01:46:07,586 --> 01:46:09,118
- I'm Tony.
- Okay.

1969
01:46:09,120 --> 01:46:11,823
You split up into separate
groups and stuff...

1970
01:46:20,065 --> 01:46:21,463
Tony, this is my mom.

1971
01:46:21,465 --> 01:46:22,665
Pleased to meet you.

1972
01:46:22,667 --> 01:46:24,701
- This is my dad.
- Oh, we've met.

1973
01:46:24,703 --> 01:46:26,769
And this is embarrassing.

1974
01:46:26,771 --> 01:46:28,037
Charmed, I'm sure.

1975
01:46:28,039 --> 01:46:30,206
My little brother, Dash.

1976
01:46:30,208 --> 01:46:32,441
And the baby
is Jack-Jack.

1977
01:46:32,443 --> 01:46:35,477
I tried to limit it
to one parent.

1978
01:46:35,479 --> 01:46:38,147
We're all going to a movie,
too, Tony. Don't mind us.

1979
01:46:38,149 --> 01:46:39,448
We'll be sitting

1980
01:46:39,450 --> 01:46:40,617
on the other side
of the theater.

1981
01:46:40,619 --> 01:46:42,151
Not watching you.

1982
01:46:42,153 --> 01:46:44,087
He's kidding.

1983
01:46:44,089 --> 01:46:47,190
They are only dropping
us off at the theater.

1984
01:46:47,192 --> 01:46:49,926
They have
other things to do.

1985
01:46:49,928 --> 01:46:52,662
So, you guys are close,
I guess.

1986
01:46:52,664 --> 01:46:55,031
- Yeah, I guess.
- We can get closer.

1987
01:46:55,033 --> 01:46:56,532
Bob.

1988
01:47:11,049 --> 01:47:12,215
Stop! Let us out!

1989
01:47:12,217 --> 01:47:13,883
Here, large popcorn,
small soda.

1990
01:47:13,885 --> 01:47:16,619
Save me a seat, center,
about eight rows back.

1991
01:47:16,621 --> 01:47:19,724
I'll be back before
the previews are over.

1992
