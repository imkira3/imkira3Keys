1
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,040
Everyone has a dream
that fills their heart...

2
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,920
a journey they must take...

3
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,550
a destiny to fulfill.

4
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,930
As close
as your imagination...

5
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,720
exists a magical place...

6
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,430
where wondrous creatures
with incredible powers...

7
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,270
help make dreams come true.

8
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,270
It's the world of Pokemon.

9
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,560
People can capture Pokemon
to be more than just pets.

10
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,220
Human trainers
and their Pokemon...

11
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,190
compete against others
in amazing contests...

12
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,060
of skill and strategy.

13
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,400
The best trainers one day
become Pokemon masters.

14
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,240
That's a dream that
burns brightly for many...

15
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,240
but none more so
than Ash Ketchum.

16
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,910
The pride of Pallet Town
began his Pokemon journey...

17
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,660
on his tenth birthday.

18
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:05,290
That's the day he qualified
to become a Pokemon trainer.

19
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:09,050
Professor Oak gave Ash
his very first Pokeball.

20
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,210
Inside was
an electric Pokemon...

21
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:14,930
with whom Ash would spark
a lifelong friendship--Pikachu.

22
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,180
Pikachu!

23
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,100
Together, Ash and Pikachu
are determined...

24
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,720
to fulfill his dream...

25
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,180
of becoming the world's
greatest Pokemon master.

26
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,230
Joining them on their quest
are Misty...

27
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,940
and yours truly, Brock...

28
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,980
in the incredible world
of Pokemon.

29
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,170
Bi.

30
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,250
Bi!

31
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,590
Bi!

32
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,180
Bi! Bi!

33
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,140
Bi!

34
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,680
Bi!

35
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,730
Hound!

36
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,190
-Bi! Bi!
-Scyther! Scyther!

37
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,570
Scyther! Scyther!

38
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,860
Bi!

39
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,030
Bi!

40
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,280
Bi!

41
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,710
Huh?

42
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,840
Ohh.

43
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,100
If you're going in,
be careful.

44
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,140
Huh?

45
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,480
Don't forget--if you hear
the Voice of the Forest...

46
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,560
don't move a muscle.

47
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,570
Huh?

48
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,440
Don't tell me
you haven't heard about it.

49
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,530
No, I haven't.

50
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,030
What's the Voice
of the Forest?

51
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,400
Well, it's only a legend...

52
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,820
but everyone around here
believes it.

53
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,950
They say there's a sound
you can hear...

54
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,700
when the spirit
that protects the forest...

55
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,830
is time-traveling.

56
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,330
Time-traveling?

57
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,170
That's one of
its special powers.

58
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:12,460
It can go back and forth
between the past and the future.

59
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,880
Wow.

60
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,800
So if you hear
a weird sound...

61
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,920
stop and stay
completely still.

62
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,340
If the spirit
catches you...

63
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,390
it could carry you off
to a different time.

64
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,180
Don't worry.
I'll be careful.

65
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,260
Mm.

66
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,810
Thanks. Bye.

67
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:27,980
Wait.

68
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,190
Huh?

69
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,440
T ake this. It's a loaf
of bread I made...

70
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,030
that's full of berries
from the forest.

71
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,900
It might come in handy
if you get hungry.

72
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,200
Here.

73
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,360
Thanks, Miss.
I appreciate it.

74
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,530
Bye.

75
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,340
Furret.

76
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,380
Furret.

77
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,880
Furret!

78
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,930
Bi!

79
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,260
Bi!

80
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,600
-Scyther!
-Bi!

81
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,810
Hound!

82
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,890
Bi!

83
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,270
Bi! Bi! Bi! Bi!

84
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,310
Scyther!

85
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,610
Bi!

86
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:20,570
Ho-o-o-ound.

87
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,820
Scyther!

88
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,610
So...

89
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,990
Bi...bi...

90
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:29,160
You've been givin' me
the slip for a long time...

91
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,540
but you won't today.

92
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,830
Bi!

93
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,920
Don't let it get away!
Let's go!

94
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,590
-Scyther!
-Hound!

95
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,920
Bi! Bi!

96
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,760
Bi! Bi!

97
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,930
Bi-i-i-i-i-i!

98
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:48,930
Huh?

99
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,980
Cele?

100
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,350
Cele!

101
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,810
Oddish. Oddish. Oddish.

102
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,860
Whoa!

103
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,820
Bi.

104
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,240
Huh? Uhh!

105
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,120
Hound!

106
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,160
Huh.

107
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:12,750
Uhh!

108
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,710
Huh?

109
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,800
Scyther!

110
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,010
Bi! Bi!

111
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,180
Let it go!

112
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,680
Two against one isn't fair!

113
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,060
Doom...hound!

114
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,100
Aah!

115
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,390
Bi!

116
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,310
Scyther! Scyther!

117
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,940
Hou-hou-hound!

118
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,230
Bi!

119
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,110
Bi!

120
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,150
Huh?

121
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,990
All right,
hand over that Celebi.

122
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,580
Celebi?

123
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,000
Why should I hand it over?
What do you want with it?

124
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,830
I'm a Pokemon hunter, kid.

125
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,170
I make good money
off of rare Pokemon.

126
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,170
First I catch 'em,
then I auction 'em off...

127
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,420
to the highest bidders.

128
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,840
Well, you're not gonna get
your hands on this Pokemon!

129
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,010
Give it to me!

130
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,140
No! Go away!

131
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,640
Bi.

132
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,530
Bi-i-i-i-i-i!

133
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,540
Could that be time-traveling?

134
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,540
Uhh.

135
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,830
Uhh.

136
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,710
Huh?

137
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,630
Bi-i-i-i-i-i!

138
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,720
I'll tell you why I'm here.

139
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:38,680
I'm here
because I heard a story...

140
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,310
that you almost
caught a Celebi...

141
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:43,360
somewhere in this forest
about 40 years ago--true?

142
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,520
I'm still a Pokemon hunter!

143
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,480
I'm not gonna tell you anything!

144
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,280
Heh heh.
We'll see about that.

145
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,750
OK.

146
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,330
Sneasel! Sneasel!

147
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:03,710
Sneasel!

148
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,050
What's that thing?

149
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,260
A Dark Ball.

150
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,390
What's it do?

151
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,640
Allow me to demonstrate.

152
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:27,230
The Pokemon I catch
with the Dark Ball...

153
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,820
become evil Pokemon...

154
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:32,570
and their power instantly
increases to the highest level.

155
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:35,030
Come on out, Tyranitar!

156
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,630
Hyper Beam Attack!

157
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,560
No, please!

158
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,480
It's gonna destroy everything!

159
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,610
Uhh!

160
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,610
Aah! Aah! All right!
All right!

161
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,700
I'll show you!
I'll show you the spot...

162
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,490
where I found that Celebi!

163
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,160
Heh heh heh heh heh.

164
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,580
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

165
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,410
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

166
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:25,460
I thought
you'd see it my way.

167
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,370
Today we find our friends...

168
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:02,240
waiting for a ferry
that will carry them...

169
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,000
to yet another Pokemon gym...

170
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,580
as they continue
their Johto League journey.

171
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,250
Brock and Misty are ready.

172
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,590
The passengers
are hurrying aboard...

173
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:13,380
and it's almost time
for the boat to leave.

174
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,170
But where are
Ash and Pikachu?

175
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,010
Well, if they don't come soon
they're gonna miss the boat.

176
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,390
T ogepi!

177
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,760
Crobat, go!

178
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,730
Crobat!

179
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,230
Cro!

180
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,520
My name's Dundee...

181
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,230
and I'm the best Pokemon
trainer in the whole town.

182
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,400
Well, my name's Ash...

183
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,110
and I'm a pretty good
Pokemon trainer, too.

184
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,780
Why don't you pick a Pokemon,
and we can have a battle.

185
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,780
Pika!

186
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,490
Croconaw, go!

187
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,240
Croconaw!

188
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,410
A Croconaw, huh?

189
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,500
Never battled
one of those before.

190
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,250
OK, Pikachu, let's go!

191
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,420
Pika!

192
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:57,550
Pokemon, Pokemon, Pokemon,
Pokemon, Pokemon

193
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,090
Let's do it

194
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,630
Thunder Shock Attack!

195
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,860
So, sounds like
you're all...

196
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,030
pretty interested
in Pokemon, huh?

197
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,070
Yeah.

198
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,990
I come from a place
just up the river...

199
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,490
and a lot
of real unusual ones...

200
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:25,990
Iive in the forest nearby.

201
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,660
Hey, if you could show us
where it is...

202
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,280
maybe we could stop
and check it out.

203
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,080
No problem.
We can get off...

204
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,450
at the next stop,
and I'll take you...

205
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:33,910
the rest of the way
in my boat.

206
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,540
Great. Thanks.

207
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,540
Pika!

208
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,040
ALL: Huh?

209
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,420
ASH: Ohh.

210
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,050
Hey, was that a Pokemon?

211
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,470
Looked like one to me.

212
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:47,800
You'll see the woods
around here are full of them.

213
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:53,020
There's one more possibility.

214
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,730
Did it look
anything like this?

215
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,770
Yeah, that's it, Professor.

216
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,020
It was a Suicune.

217
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,230
A Suicune?

218
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,030
What kind of Pokemon
is that, Professor?

219
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,990
It's one of the legendary
Pokemon, Brock...

220
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,530
and not very much
is known about it.

221
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,240
And according
to folk tales...

222
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,410
Suicune personifies
the north wind...

223
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,330
and it's believed
to have the power...

224
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:13,120
to purify tainted waters.

225
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,410
Wow, I hope I get
to see Suicune again.

226
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:17,830
Its sounds like
it's a pretty cool one.

227
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,630
Believe you me, kids...

228
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:22,000
those tales
are definitely true.

229
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,670
Really? How do you know that
for sure, Professor?

230
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,880
Have you ever seen
a Suicune before?

231
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,680
Yes, I sure have,
but only one time.

232
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,970
Wow! Where?

233
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,140
Hey, Ash, come on!

234
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,470
We've gotta go!

235
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,730
OK!

236
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,520
Uh, bye, Professor.

237
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,160
I wonder if I should've told him
before he hung up.

238
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,660
Hmm.

239
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,620
The quicker we get
into that forest...

240
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,750
the quicker we can look
for those Pokemon.

241
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,710
Maybe even that Suicune.

242
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,300
Those twerps won't get away now.

243
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,630
They're right beneath us.

244
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,600
Of course, they're
beneath us. They're twerps.

245
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,470
Now all we do is
swoop in and swipe Pikachu.

246
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,520
Uh-oh. Something's wrong
with my leg.

247
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,270
All this pedaling
is giving me a cramp.

248
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,310
Oh! Ow!

249
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,940
Aah! You can't cramp!
We'll crash!

250
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,120
All right.

251
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,170
What do we do now?

252
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,210
Don't worry, Misty.
You'll see.

253
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,590
-Whoa.
-Pi?

254
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,880
Toge?

255
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,720
Toge! Toge!
Toge! Toge!

256
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,230
Ha ha ha!

257
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,650
Toge-togepi!

258
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,530
Well, we're here.

259
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,820
Here? Where?

260
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,330
Look closer.

261
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,120
Tree houses?

262
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,540
Togepi!

263
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,710
That's right, Brock.
Welcome to Arborville.

264
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,560
Pika?

265
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,680
-Whoa.
-Prrri!

266
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,940
Stop right there!

267
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,400
Huh?

268
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,570
I suppose you kids
are heading into the forest...

269
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:49,940
to look for Pokemon.

270
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,490
Yes, ma'am.

271
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,570
Then you're gonna love
what you see in there.

272
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,950
I love what I see here!
My name's Brock...

273
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,780
and I'm studying to
become a Pokemon breeder...

274
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,870
but my specialty
is human relations.

275
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,830
Oh?

276
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,290
Please tell me your name!

277
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,960
My name's Diana,
and that's my grandma.

278
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,580
She's been guarding
the entrance to the forest...

279
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,880
since she was my age.

280
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,880
Listen for The Voice
of the Forest...

281
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,300
and if you hear it,
stop and be still...

282
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,300
or you will not get away.

283
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,800
The Voice of the Forest?

284
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,470
It's an old village legend.

285
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:19,560
Yes, it's a legend,
and a true one.

286
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,890
If you hear The Voice,
stop where you are.

287
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,180
Uh, we gotta hurry...

288
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,350
but thanks a lot for
the warning, ma'am.

289
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,480
Pika!

290
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,320
Diana, why don't you
come, too, and protect us?

291
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,530
Then she'd need
protection from you.

292
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,620
I wonder what
Diana's grandmother meant...

293
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,830
by 'The Voice
of the Forest. "

294
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,170
Maybe the sound of the wind
or the trees...

295
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:50,090
the water, or maybe
the voices of the Pokemon.

296
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,010
Pi?

297
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:56,840
Ohh. I wonder what that is.

298
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,300
Maybe it's The Voice
of the Forest.

299
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,510
-Come on!
-Pika!

300
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,600
Ash, no!

301
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,680
Hey, shouldn't we stand still?

302
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,680
Uh...wait up!

303
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:26,120
Bi.

304
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,170
Bi.

305
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,420
Bi.

306
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,050
Hey, it's a kid.

307
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,590
Is he OK?

308
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,670
He's still breathing.

309
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,010
Yeah.

310
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,470
Let's take him
back to Diana's house.

311
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,510
Good idea.

312
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,720
Yeah.

313
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,220
Bi...

314
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:46,020
I wonder what that light was.

315
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:50,270
Hey! Diana!

316
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:53,730
Diana! We need help!

317
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:56,110
Oh, dear. What's happened?

318
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,530
Hey, Ash, he's waking up.

319
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,200
Take it easy.
You're gonna be OK.

320
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,450
Pika.

321
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:06,750
Uhh.

322
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:08,960
Uhh!

323
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,290
What'd you do with that Celebi?

324
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,960
Hey, I'm trying to help you!

325
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,760
That's enough, you two.
Knock it off.

326
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,880
Settle down!

327
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,340
Who are you anyway?

328
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,380
Huh?

329
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,430
Where am l?

330
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,050
Howd I get here?

331
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:25,270
I carried you here
on my back, that's how!

332
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,560
What's going on?

333
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,890
MlSTY:
We found him unconscious...

334
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,890
when we were out
in the forest.

335
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:30,940
Oh!

336
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,980
Oh-oh-oh!

337
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,440
I can't believe it.
It's really you.

338
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,440
Huh?

339
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,900
You've come back.

340
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,360
Oh, thank goodness!

341
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,360
Uh, Grandma...

342
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,490
where did he
come back from?

343
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,410
Diana, I've told you
the story...

344
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,500
about what happened
when I was a young girl.

345
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,830
A little boy disappeared
from the forest.

346
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:52,130
But this boy can't be him.

347
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,790
Well, maybe it can't be...

348
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,500
-but it is.
-Huh?

349
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,380
Ah! You're the girl...

350
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,510
who gave me
the loaf of bread.

351
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,050
Yes.

352
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,220
Here.

353
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:11,560
I've kept this all these years
in case you ever came back.

354
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,900
This is my sketchbook.
How--

355
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,070
You've been away...

356
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,360
on a 40-year-long journey,
young man.

357
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,620
40 years?

358
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,780
What do you mean?

359
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,410
The legend says
The Voice of the Forest...

360
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:30,210
can catch a person and take them
on a trip through time.

361
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:32,250
-Huh?
-Through time?

362
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,880
Stantler?
Stan--

363
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,380
Stantler!

364
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,730
Uhh!

365
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:52,140
Where's Celebi?

366
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,650
What happened to Celebi?

367
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:54,690
Celebi?

368
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:57,020
Was there a Pokemon
with me in the forest?

369
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,780
We didn't see any.

370
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,240
The Pokemon you met
that day was a Celebi?

371
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,650
Yes.

372
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:05,240
We know Celebi
as The Voice of the Forest...

373
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,370
the spirit that protects it.

374
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:09,490
They say that Celebi
can travel through time.

375
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,040
You two must've been
in danger...

376
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,660
and Celebi just picked
the fastest way...

377
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,790
to get you out of it.

378
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,330
It's must've
escaped to the future...

379
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:16,710
and taken you along with it.

380
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,000
I'm afraid you're right.

381
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,840
Celebi lives
deep in the forest...

382
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,680
in a place we call
"The Lake of Life."

383
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,550
That's probably where
it's gone back to now.

384
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:29,350
I've got a feeling Celebi
still may be hurt.

385
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:32,890
I have to go back into
that forest and find Celebi.

386
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:33,940
I'll go, too!

387
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,020
Me, too!

388
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,060
So will l!

389
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,190
Togepi!

390
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,360
My name's Brock...

391
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,730
and I'm a Pokemon breeder.

392
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:40,730
I'm Sam.

393
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:41,730
And I'm Misty.

394
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:44,070
My specialty is water Pokemon.

395
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,360
My name's Ash Ketchum...

396
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,450
and I'm trying
to be a Pokemon master.

397
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:48,530
Pika!

398
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,580
Oh, yeah,
and this is Pikachu.

399
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,790
Pikachu!

400
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,910
Hi, Pikachu. I'm Sam.

401
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:57,580
Our glider
didn't glide very well.

402
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:00,420
Next time
we spring for a motor.

403
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,420
I wonder where
those twerps are.

404
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,800
We may never know.
Huh?

405
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,840
-Huh?
-Huh?

406
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,390
Well, well.

407
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:10,140
I can't believe my eyes.

408
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,600
Looks like it's a good thing...

409
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,390
we crashed after
all, eh, Meowth?

410
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,520
Come on, let's get down
and tail them twerps!

411
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,350
Pika!

412
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,900
Pikachu!

413
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:23,480
Pi--pi--pi--pi--

414
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,740
Pi--Pika!

415
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,990
Guys, look up there!

416
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,870
The Pokemon
are all together.

417
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:39,380
I'm coming, too!

418
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:45,970
Ash climbs just like a Mankey.

419
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:47,130
Togepi!

420
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,340
Pi!

421
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,350
-Aah!
-Pika!

422
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,940
Sam, maybe you should wait
down with Brock and Misty.

423
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:00,020
No. I have to find Celebi.

424
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,810
I couldn't
protect it before...

425
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:03,320
so I've gotta help it now.

426
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,660
I know how you feel, Sam,
but take it easy.

427
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,700
Pi! Pi! Pi! Pi!

428
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,840
Uh. Ah!

429
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:27,260
Bi...bi.

430
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,800
Hey.

431
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,090
Is this the Celebi?

432
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:31,090
Mm-hmm.

433
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:32,430
Come on, Celebi.

434
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,350
Bi. Bi!

435
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:38,350
Whoa! Unh!

436
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,690
Hey! What'd you do that for?

437
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,610
I think Ash just evolved
into a primate.

438
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,360
We're only trying to help you.

439
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,950
Bi!

440
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,320
Whoa!

441
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,370
What's going on?

442
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,700
Pika--

443
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,580
No, Pikachu, don't!

444
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,210
Don't be mad at it.

445
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,790
It's just afraid...

446
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,210
and it's hurt, too.

447
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,710
A hunter attacked it.

448
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,130
That's why it's scared.

449
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,210
OK. Here goes.

450
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,970
Celebi, we're your friends.

451
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,810
We don't want to hurt you.

452
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:17,310
We just want to help you.

453
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,430
Bi!

454
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,190
I tried to help you before.

455
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:23,100
Don't you remember, Celebi?

456
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,110
I got you away
from the Pokemon hunter.

457
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,570
It's OK.

458
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,480
Bi?

459
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:32,280
You just take it easy.

460
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,910
And we will, too.

461
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,370
There...

462
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:37,910
Bi.

463
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,330
Bi?

464
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:43,330
Uh...

465
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:45,080
Ha ha!

466
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,430
You're safe with me, Celebi.

467
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,430
Bi.

468
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,350
Bi.

469
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,560
Pik--Pik--Pik...

470
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,270
Brock, it seems really weak.

471
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,150
Yeah, we better hurry.

472
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,780
We'll take it
to a Pokemon center.

473
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,780
Pika-pi!

474
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,320
Who are they?

475
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,950
Prepare for trouble.
Your future looks grim.

476
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,290
And we're not afraid
to go out on a limb.

477
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:21,790
To protect the world
from devastation.

478
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:24,290
To unite all peoples
within our nation.

479
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:26,960
To denounce the evils
of truth and love.

480
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,300
To extend our reach
to the stars above.

481
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,630
Jessie.

482
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,760
James.

483
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,130
Team Rocket...

484
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,840
blast off
at the speed of light.

485
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,640
Surrender now
or prepare to fight.

486
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,350
Meowth--that's right.

487
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,480
Wobbuffet!
Wobbuffet!

488
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,140
Aah!

489
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,480
Hmm.

490
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,980
Do you think
they're gonna be OK?

491
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,480
Unfortunately, yes.

492
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,780
Hmm.

493
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,860
You twerps got lucky this time.

494
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,820
They're always lucky.

495
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,660
Wobbuffet!

496
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,530
Don't press your luck, blubbo.

497
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:01,990
Hang in there, Celebi.

498
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:05,290
Look, that's
the village up there!

499
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,000
Aah!

500
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,340
I've been looking
for that little Celebi.

501
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,590
Who are you?

502
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,220
A Pokemon lover.

503
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,430
Leave us alone!

504
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,350
What does he want?

505
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:22,180
He must be trying to steal
our Pikachu away.

506
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,850
Well, we won't let him!

507
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,770
Weezing. Weezing.

508
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:33,030
Huhh!

509
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,320
What's that?

510
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,530
A Tyranitar...

511
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:41,030
but there's something
funny about it.

512
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,330
Hyper-beam!

513
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,340
Here it comes!

514
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,050
Pika! Pika!

515
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:57,880
Weezing!

516
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,260
Two can play
the Celebi-stealing game.

517
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,400
Who are you three?

518
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,900
Look at that mask.

519
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,150
I've seen him before.

520
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,780
Yeah, wasn't he in
that Mexican wrestling movie?

521
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,780
No, Meowth,
he's from Team Rocket.

522
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,910
The lron Mask Marauder!

523
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:24,120
So you heard about me.

524
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,290
Yeah!

525
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:27,040
Oh, yes, we've heard
a lot about you.

526
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,500
As you can tell
from the uniforms...

527
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,540
we're also members
of Team Rocket.

528
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,500
Me, too, but Pokemon
get to go naked.

529
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,090
Go!

530
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,220
Scizor!

531
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,600
Sneasel!

532
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,770
Aah.

533
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:48,770
Misty!

534
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:51,480
I think Misty's hurt.

535
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,650
Brock, I twisted my knee.

536
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,440
You better stay off it.

537
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,070
Pi--Pika!

538
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,320
Something's coming!

539
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,620
Sneasel!

540
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,660
Scizor!

541
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,660
Scizor!

542
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,410
What are they doing here?

543
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,000
They must want Celebi.

544
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Scizor!

545
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,040
Snease!

546
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,250
All right, then they're
in for a battle.

547
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,920
Brock, take care of Celebi.

548
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,960
Right.

549
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,970
All right,
I'm with you, Ash. Ready?

550
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:22,300
Uh...

551
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,020
Char!

552
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,480
Go!

553
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,350
Bay!

554
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,810
Scizor!

555
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,780
B-bay!

556
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,820
Scizor!

557
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,820
Bay.

558
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,820
Quick, Bayleef,
use your razor leaf!

559
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,160
Bay...

560
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,990
Scizor! [Echoes]

561
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:48,490
Bay!

562
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:50,080
Bay.

563
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,290
Scizor!

564
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,000
Scizor! [Echoes]

565
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,040
Bay...

566
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,090
Char. Char!

567
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,710
Char. Char!

568
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:01,800
Scizor! [Echoes]

569
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,180
Bay! Bay.

570
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,510
Are you OK?

571
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,350
Ash, you gotta find
the real one.

572
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,930
It's using double team.

573
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:09,100
Mm.

574
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,390
Bayleef, listen,
you gotta concentrate!

575
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:13,350
Then you can find the real one!

576
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,270
Scizor! [Echoes]

577
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:17,190
Bay. Bay.

578
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,730
Scizor...Scizor.

579
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,070
Bay!

580
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,110
Scizor!

581
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,820
Bay!

582
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:28,200
Scizor!

583
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,040
Yeah, Bayleef, you did it!

584
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:31,660
You're a great trainer, Ash.

585
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,830
Well, it helps
when you have great Pokemon.

586
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,210
Look out. Sneasel!

587
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:38,040
Sneasel!

588
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,040
Char.

589
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,630
Charmeleon, use head butt!

590
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,380
Char! Char!

591
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,220
Snease.

592
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:47,300
Hey, you're not
a bad trainer yourself.

593
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,850
We make a good team.

594
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,820
-Scizor!
-Snease!

595
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,860
-Scizor!
-Snease!

596
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:10,530
Those kids aren't as wimpy
as I thought they'd be.

597
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,460
This makes things interesting.

598
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:24,220
We gotta find the way out.

599
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,970
Pi?

600
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,930
This is getting bad.

601
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,350
Pppi.

602
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:36,270
Bi. Bi. Bi. Bi.

603
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,270
We better keep moving forward.

604
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,190
If we stop now,
we might be too late.

605
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,480
-Pika!
-Huh?

606
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,860
It's Ursaring.

607
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,070
Huh?

608
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,660
Daddy Ursa.

609
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,700
Goom-um.

610
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,290
Oh...

611
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:55,620
What are they doing?

612
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,080
I think they're telling us
to follow them.

613
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,880
Pika!

614
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,130
Should we?

615
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:02,420
Yeah.

616
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,560
Stantler.

617
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:21,650
-Goom.
-Stantler.

618
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:22,730
Stantler.

619
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:34,490
Furret.

620
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,450
Furret.

621
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:41,710
Stantler.

622
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,340
Furret.

623
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,750
-Stantler.
-Furret.

624
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:45,960
Furret.

625
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,260
Furret.

626
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:49,880
Furret.

627
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,140
Furret.

628
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,010
Furret.

629
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,350
Furret.

630
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,970
Furret.

631
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,140
Furret. Furret.

632
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,560
Furret. Furret.

633
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,600
Furret.

634
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:13,570
Hey, do you think this
could be The Lake of Life...

635
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:16,160
that Diana's grandmother
was talking about?

636
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,040
Bi...Bi...

637
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,840
Bi...Bi...Bi...

638
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:53,610
Bi...Bi...

639
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,490
Hey, Sam, look.

640
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:58,910
Huh? Uh--

641
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,930
Look, guys, Celebi's swimming.

642
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:57,300
And it's glowing.

643
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,350
Pika!

644
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:00,350
This must be the Lake of Life.

645
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:02,310
Hey, that's it!
The lake water...

646
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:04,270
must have brought
Celebi back to life.

647
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:05,270
Oh.

648
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,610
Ha ha.

649
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,650
Pika. Pika!

650
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:15,400
Bi!

651
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,490
Bi!

652
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:17,490
Celebi!

653
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,490
All right!

654
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:19,620
Pikachu!

655
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,660
Bi!

656
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,000
Ha ha ha.

657
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:25,410
Whee! Whee!

658
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,210
Pikachu!

659
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:30,000
Whee! Bi!

660
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,130
Bi!

661
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,210
Toge! Toge!

662
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:34,210
Bi!

663
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:37,010
Whee!

664
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:41,850
-Bi!
-Whoa.

665
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:43,680
All right, then!

666
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,430
Let's do it!

667
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:46,850
Yeah!

668
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,950
Mm! Mm!

669
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:14,590
Mm! Mm!

670
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,930
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

671
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:26,430
Pika! Pika!

672
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:27,430
All right!

673
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:34,070
Bi.

674
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,070
Oh.

675
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,490
Hey!

676
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:38,450
Heh heh.

677
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,070
My knee's better.

678
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,700
Thanks, Celebi!

679
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,080
Bi!

680
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,080
Bi!

681
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:51,170
Hi! Hey, you guys!

682
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,340
Bi! Bi!

683
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,340
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

684
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,760
This is great!

685
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,890
Oh...

686
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:06,520
There's the village
over there.

687
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,310
Jaj, jaj...

688
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,020
Ja, ja, ja...

689
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,150
Ja, ja, ja...

690
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:15,360
Bi! Bi!

691
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,610
Bi!

692
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,650
Bi-bi!

693
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:23,200
Bi.

694
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,620
Bi! Bi! Bi! Bi!

695
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,580
Huh?

696
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:35,290
Awesome!
These are really good.

697
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:37,000
Yeah?

698
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,300
Pika.

699
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,920
Ah, you're right.

700
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,010
Pika, Pika!

701
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:42,010
Huh.

702
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,800
Mmm, they're tasty.

703
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,140
They're delicious.

704
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,260
Bi!

705
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,180
Bi!

706
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,980
I'm gonna keep some for later.

707
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:52,980
Pikachu!

708
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,440
Thanks for taking us here,
Celebi.

709
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,980
Yeah.

710
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,480
These are good ones.

711
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,360
Have some, Celebi.

712
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,570
Bi-bi-bi-bi!

713
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:05,620
Bi-bi-bi-bi!

714
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:17,340
Don't you worry.
We'll find Celebi.

715
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,300
I'd rather find some lunch.

716
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,470
So would l.

717
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:23,800
Or a bathroom.

718
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,800
-Huh?
-Huh?

719
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,100
Lucky us!

720
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,310
It's a peach tree!

721
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:33,270
Grab that big one there, Meowth.

722
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,310
You got it, Jessie!

723
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:36,360
Eee!

724
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,530
Ah! Ah!

725
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:44,910
-Hey!
-Hey!

726
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:52,200
Nice catch.

727
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,620
It was peachy.

728
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,080
Huh?

729
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:00,000
There goes our driver!

730
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,210
Wait! Come back!
Don't leave us!

731
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:04,260
We'll even chip in for gas!

732
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,150
Sammy, it's the middle
of the night.

733
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,070
I know, but I can't sleep.

734
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,780
Hey, that's great.

735
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,620
Thanks. When I meet
a new Pokemon...

736
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,290
I sketch him in this book.

737
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:35,620
Can I take a look?

738
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,830
Mm-hmm.

739
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:39,500
Hmm.

740
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,800
Oh, these are amazing!

741
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,050
This is like
a handmade Pokedex.

742
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:49,800
That's this machine that
has pictures of Pokemon.

743
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,430
I guess you know a lot
about the future, huh, Ash?

744
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:54,770
At least more than I do.

745
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:57,020
Yeah, I guess so...

746
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:00,060
but I'm sure glad I'm not stuck
in it like you are.

747
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,690
Oh, hey, I'm sorry.

748
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:16,250
Hey, I didn't mean
to make you feel bad, Sam.

749
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,660
Honest, I didn't.

750
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,000
That's OK.

751
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,960
I think I'll like
living in the future...

752
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,790
but it'll take
some getting used to.

753
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:24,130
Yeah. Probably.

754
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:27,220
But then I think about my mother
worrying about me...

755
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,260
and wondering where I am.

756
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,300
And I wonder
if she still wonders.

757
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:35,890
Oh. Yeah, me, too.

758
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:38,100
Hey, what about your mom, Ash?

759
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,900
I bet she worries about you...

760
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,940
when you're out on
your Pokemon journey.

761
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,650
Yeah, she worries, I guess.

762
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,240
Maybe that's just what moms do.

763
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,240
Mm.

764
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,780
Thinking about my mom...

765
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,620
gets me thinking
about her cooking.

766
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,040
Hey, I have something.

767
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,160
Huh?

768
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,170
Diana's grandmother made this...

769
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:07,420
but that was about
40 years ago.

770
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,340
Still looks
pretty fresh, though.

771
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,340
-Mm.
-Mm.

772
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,680
It's great!

773
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,680
Tastes like it was
made yesterday.

774
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,310
Pika?

775
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:19,350
Pika?

776
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,350
Bi? Bi?

777
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,400
What's the matter, Pikachu?

778
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,740
Hey, Ash, look.

779
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:29,780
Huh?

780
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,370
Oh.

781
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:36,370
Oh.

782
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,340
Oh, cool.

783
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,300
Wow.

784
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:58,470
Look at all the Butterfree.

785
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:01,560
I hope you'll be free, Sam.

786
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,560
Huh?

787
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,440
I mean, to go back in time.

788
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,440
Oh.

789
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:16,530
-Oh.
-Oh.

790
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:18,200
Free!

791
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,290
Wait for me!

792
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:21,540
Bi! Bi!

793
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,670
Pika!

794
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,390
Ah. Whoa.

795
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:36,800
Oh, cool.

796
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:47,610
Pika!

797
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,420
Bi!

798
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,710
Well, the village
is real close now.

799
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:11,800
Bi! Bi!

800
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,800
Look!

801
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,130
Pika!

802
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:16,430
Bi-i!

803
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:19,930
Bi! Bi!

804
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:22,560
Bi!

805
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,480
Thought you'd gotten rid of us...

806
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,100
didn't you, twerps?

807
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:28,360
But Team Rocket doesn't
give up so easily!

808
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,900
Not you again.

809
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:33,820
All right...

810
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,910
we ain't leaving
without that Celebi.

811
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:41,330
Pikachu!

812
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:44,580
Nice try!

813
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,040
Togepi!

814
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:53,210
Oh!

815
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:58,510
Bi!

816
00:43:58,510 --> 00:43:59,590
Celebi!

817
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,680
This ought to calm you down.

818
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,520
Bi!

819
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,140
Hey!

820
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:08,310
Pika-pi!

821
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,860
Dark Ball, go!

822
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:22,030
-Aah!
-Aah!

823
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:27,250
Celebi is mine.

824
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:29,080
Let it go!

825
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:34,630
Stupid kids.

826
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,550
Aah! Hey! Aah!

827
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:47,430
Pika!

828
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,030
-Whoa!
-Aah!

829
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:04,280
Don't worry. I got ya.

830
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,490
Aah!

831
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:09,040
I think that Dark Ball
belongs to me.

832
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,830
Aah--aah!

833
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:21,890
Ash!

834
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:22,930
-Pika-pi!
-Toge!

835
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:24,760
Huh?

836
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:36,190
Don't waste your time.

837
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:39,240
It's too late to save
your friend Celebi.

838
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,410
Stantler.

839
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:48,370
Because the sweet little
Pokemon you used to know...

840
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,410
doesn't exist anymore.

841
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:52,000
Here, see for yourself!

842
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,920
Celebi, get rid of them all!

843
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:12,270
Aah!

844
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:15,770
Pika!

845
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,460
I don't understand.

846
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:35,750
If Celebi's their friend,
I'd hate to see their enemies.

847
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:37,500
Excellent.

848
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,000
You're very strong, Celebi.

849
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,720
Now show me even
more of your power!

850
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:53,810
[Laughs]

851
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:57,360
With a Pokemon like you,
no one will ever stop me!

852
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,610
Celebi.

853
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:08,280
Celebi's building a nasty nest.

854
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,950
Oh, no!

855
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,800
Oh.

856
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,840
Oh, what is that?

857
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,880
I don't know.

858
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,130
Grandma.

859
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:27,800
We'd better go find out.

860
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,010
Right.

861
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,680
Mm...uhh.

862
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:33,810
Uhh!

863
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:35,730
Celebi! Uhh!

864
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:37,100
I've gotta--

865
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:38,400
Uhh!

866
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,730
Take it easy, Ash.

867
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:41,940
You might be hurt.

868
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:46,490
Hey!

869
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:49,320
Hi, guys! Just stay
right where you are.

870
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,490
We're coming down to get you!

871
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:53,410
Diana!

872
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,750
I can't believe
they found us!

873
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:28,400
Uhh, this is awful.

874
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,450
Forcing the Spirit
of the Forest...

875
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:32,240
to destroy the forest.

876
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,660
This is just despicable.

877
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,500
Do you think Jessie's
going to be all right?

878
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:42,790
Yeah, but I ain't so sure
about Celebi. Heh.

879
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,440
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

880
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,860
Uh, excuse me,
Mr. Masked Person...

881
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:03,480
but could you let me
out of here?

882
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:07,780
Not yet. I need a witness who
can report back to Giovanni.

883
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:09,860
I want the head
of Team Rocket to know...

884
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:12,160
just how powerful Celebi is...

885
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,490
and how powerful I am, too.

886
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:17,950
Celebi, the time has come!

887
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,020
I'm very impressed.

888
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:22,640
You and Celebi
are extremely powerful!

889
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,190
Now just get me down
from here...

890
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:26,190
and I'll recommend you
for a big promotion...

891
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:28,360
when you give Celebi
to the boss.

892
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:29,780
Ha ha ha ha ha!

893
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:33,610
I control the most powerful
Pokemon in the world!

894
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:35,950
Why would I want to give
something that valuable...

895
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:37,160
to the boss?

896
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,450
What do you mean?

897
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:41,040
Now the boss
has to be afraid of me...

898
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:44,210
because Celebi gives me
the power to destroy him!

899
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:46,960
With Celebi,
I can rule Team Rocket...

900
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,460
and the whole world,
if I want to!

901
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:53,840
Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha!

902
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,390
What is that?

903
00:50:55,390 --> 00:50:57,800
The evil Celebi
must've created it.

904
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,140
Pika?

905
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,480
Celebi!

906
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:12,820
Pika!

907
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:14,490
Oh, you again.

908
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:16,700
Celebi, get rid of 'em now!

909
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:23,580
Celebi!

910
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:24,910
Hold on! Uhh!

911
00:51:57,610 --> 00:51:59,120
Is everybody OK?

912
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,410
I think so.

913
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:01,660
I'm still alive.

914
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:02,790
SAM: Me, too.

915
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:03,790
ASH: So am l.

916
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:05,120
Pika!

917
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,620
Grandma!

918
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:09,920
I'm alive, too, but just barely.

919
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,130
Hmm.

920
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:14,510
We have to stop
that horrible thing.

921
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:20,760
We're no match for
that big twig monster.

922
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,220
I know.

923
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:23,810
Poor Jessie.

924
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:31,650
All right, Pikachu,
try a Thunder Bolt.

925
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:33,190
Pika...

926
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:35,070
chuuu!

927
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:39,570
Celebi, get rid
of these children!

928
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:48,580
Pika!

929
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:51,000
Celebi, do it now!

930
00:52:56,050 --> 00:52:57,340
Huh?

931
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:58,380
Toge?

932
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:12,730
The north wind.

933
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:14,520
The north wind saved them.

934
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:15,820
Suicune!

935
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,910
Uhh! Uhh!

936
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:22,990
Aah!

937
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:25,910
Hmm.

938
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:29,040
You must've come here
to help us out.

939
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:33,540
Then we need you to take us
to Celebi right away!

940
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:38,710
Heh heh heh heh.
Nows my chance...

941
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:40,760
to capture a Suicune, too!

942
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:51,270
Tyranitar, Hyper Beam!

943
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:53,810
We've gotta stop him!

944
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:55,270
Go, Onix! Uhh!

945
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:18,300
Hmm.

946
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:19,760
Ohh.

947
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:22,630
Celebi.

948
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:24,340
Celebi!

949
00:55:18,230 --> 00:55:20,480
Good work, Onix. Return!

950
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:23,820
Heh heh heh heh.

951
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,820
Playtime is over, children.

952
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:27,320
Get them, Celebi.

953
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:31,240
Be careful. This thing could
destroy the whole forest!

954
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,660
And the Pokemon!

955
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:34,870
Suicune!

956
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:54,730
Good job!
Now teach 'em a lesson!

957
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:05,240
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
That's what'll happen...

958
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,280
to anybody
who tries to stop me!

959
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,030
Pika!

960
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,290
Huh?

961
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:16,960
You have to be careful.

962
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,870
Celebi's just above us.

963
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:20,000
Thanks a lot.

964
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,340
Let's go, Sam.

965
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:23,050
-Right.
-Pika!

966
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:27,380
Uhh! Where are you going?

967
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:29,260
Get me out of here! Hey!

968
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:35,930
Celebi, you have to stop!

969
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:37,180
You're supposed
to protect the forest...

970
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:38,190
not destroy it!

971
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:39,350
Celebi!

972
00:56:45,190 --> 00:56:46,320
Bi!

973
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,490
Bi.

974
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:57,960
Bi! Bi-i-i-i!

975
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:00,080
What are you
waiting for, Celebi?

976
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:01,380
They're your enemies!

977
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:04,050
Bi!

978
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:10,340
-Uhh!
-Pikachu!

979
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:13,430
Celebi, we're not your enemies!

980
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:15,180
We're trying to save you!

981
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:16,930
Pika!

982
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:21,230
Bi-i-i-i-i!

983
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:22,560
Bi-i-i-i-i!

984
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:23,980
Try to remember!

985
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,150
Celebi...

986
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:27,490
you brought me with you
here to the future!

987
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:30,910
Celebi, destroy them!

988
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:37,870
Bi-i-i-i-i!

989
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:41,790
Huh?

990
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:43,380
Uh, where's it going?

991
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,810
Bi-i-i-i-i!

992
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:14,660
Celebi, it's me.

993
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:16,200
Don't you remember?

994
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:20,410
Bi. Bi.

995
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:21,660
Bi!

996
00:58:23,870 --> 00:58:25,580
Pika!

997
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:27,960
Pika!

998
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:31,340
Pika!

999
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:33,840
Pika! Pika!

1000
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,260
Pika! Pika!

1001
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:38,600
Look at me!

1002
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:40,810
Bi.

1003
00:58:44,310 --> 00:58:45,650
Remember?

1004
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:46,650
Pika!

1005
00:58:46,650 --> 00:58:48,940
Celebi, don't help that hunter.

1006
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:50,070
Fight him.

1007
00:58:50,070 --> 00:58:51,360
-Aah!
-Pika!

1008
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:53,360
Pika!

1009
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,280
I won't give up!

1010
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,300
Bi.

1011
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:18,850
Hmm?

1012
00:59:19,970 --> 00:59:21,430
Huh?

1013
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:24,270
What in the--

1014
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:25,810
What's going on?

1015
00:59:25,810 --> 00:59:26,810
Aah!

1016
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:29,690
Bi.

1017
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:30,690
Huh?

1018
00:59:30,690 --> 00:59:31,780
Bi?

1019
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:33,190
Celebi!

1020
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:34,280
Pika!

1021
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:35,650
We did it!

1022
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:38,490
Oh, no! Aah!

1023
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:44,000
Aah! Aah!

1024
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,250
Aah! Aah!

1025
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:49,840
Meowth, look!

1026
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,590
There goes Jessie!

1027
00:59:59,350 --> 01:00:00,600
Bi!

1028
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:03,770
Bi!

1029
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:16,360
Oh, no!

1030
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:17,780
Bi-i-i-i!

1031
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,300
Oh, Ash is all right!

1032
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:40,180
Yeah, and so is Sam.

1033
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:41,970
They've got Celebi, too.

1034
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:42,970
Huh?

1035
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,810
What's wrong?

1036
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:52,480
I don't know.
Something bad.

1037
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:00,740
The water.

1038
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:02,120
Get it into the water!

1039
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:09,710
ASH: It's not working.

1040
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:11,210
But why not?

1041
01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:13,040
The forest is hurt.

1042
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,800
The water's tainted.

1043
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,920
The lake is dying.

1044
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:18,970
But then-wait a second.

1045
01:01:20,430 --> 01:01:23,600
Suicune has the power to make
the water clean again.

1046
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,890
Suicune,
if you clean the water...

1047
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:27,180
we can save Celebi.

1048
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,600
The legend's true.

1049
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:07,310
The north wind
saved the lake.

1050
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:15,730
Celebi, the water's clean again.

1051
01:02:15,730 --> 01:02:17,820
Pika.

1052
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:23,660
It isn't working.

1053
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:28,990
All right, then.
We'll keep trying.

1054
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:38,920
See? These are those berries
we found in the forest.

1055
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:40,880
Here you go.

1056
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:43,680
Uhh.

1057
01:02:46,050 --> 01:02:47,260
Uh...

1058
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,770
Heh. That's OK.

1059
01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:52,430
Uhh.

1060
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:57,560
Uh, Celebi?

1061
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,240
Celebi, you can't die!

1062
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:18,040
Pika?

1063
01:03:21,210 --> 01:03:23,970
Celebi didn't do
anything wrong.

1064
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:26,340
It was a human being
who forced Celebi...

1065
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:28,140
to destroy the forest.

1066
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:31,310
Celebi never even had a choice.

1067
01:03:31,310 --> 01:03:33,310
Uhh! And now--uhh--

1068
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:35,980
it can't have a choice.

1069
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:39,110
Now it's too late to choose
'cause Celebi is gonna die!

1070
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:30,370
Toge-to?

1071
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:31,410
Huh?

1072
01:04:31,370 --> 01:04:33,040
Huh?

1073
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:34,160
Pika.

1074
01:04:46,010 --> 01:04:47,420
-Ohh.
-Grandma.

1075
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:48,930
I know that sound.

1076
01:04:48,930 --> 01:04:50,930
The Voice of the Forest.

1077
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:02,520
Ahh.

1078
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:11,630
Bi?

1079
01:06:11,630 --> 01:06:12,800
Bi?

1080
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:14,140
Bi!

1081
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:15,640
Bi.

1082
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:17,930
Bi?

1083
01:06:17,930 --> 01:06:19,020
Ohh.

1084
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:20,640
Pika!

1085
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,190
Bi.

1086
01:06:22,190 --> 01:06:23,270
Bi?

1087
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:24,650
Bi!

1088
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:26,570
Bi-i-i-i-i!

1089
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:28,980
-Ha ha.
-Togepi!

1090
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:31,150
The spirits of
the future and the past...

1091
01:06:31,150 --> 01:06:33,320
can travel through time
as well...

1092
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:35,320
and so they've all come.

1093
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:36,660
They've must've sensed...

1094
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:38,410
that their friend
was in trouble.

1095
01:06:38,410 --> 01:06:39,490
Pika.

1096
01:06:39,490 --> 01:06:42,460
And now they're here to help.

1097
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:44,000
Ha.

1098
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,420
Bi.

1099
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:48,050
Bi! Bi!

1100
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:58,850
Bi-i-i-i-i-i!

1101
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:13,900
Bi!

1102
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:15,700
Bi!

1103
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:18,200
Bi! Bi!

1104
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,240
Bi!

1105
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:21,620
Bi! Bi!

1106
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:24,580
Bi? Bi.

1107
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,670
Pika!

1108
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:32,090
Bi! Bi! Bi!

1109
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:34,550
Bi!

1110
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:35,720
Pika-pi!

1111
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:38,800
-Ha ha!
-Hey!

1112
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:39,970
Bi! Bi!

1113
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:42,520
Bi!

1114
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:45,060
Bi-i-i-i-i!

1115
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,320
Bi! Bi!

1116
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:51,530
It's the hunter!

1117
01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:56,150
And now I have everything I need
to rule the world!

1118
01:07:56,150 --> 01:07:58,410
Give Celebi back!

1119
01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:01,700
Bi-i-i-i!

1120
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:05,370
Ha ha ha ha!

1121
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,420
Celebi!

1122
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:14,010
Get off me, kid!

1123
01:08:14,010 --> 01:08:16,090
Give it back!

1124
01:08:16,090 --> 01:08:18,300
Pikachu, use your Thunder Bolt!

1125
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:19,390
Pika!

1126
01:08:19,390 --> 01:08:21,350
Uhh! No! Wait! Pikachu!

1127
01:08:21,350 --> 01:08:23,600
Aaaaah!

1128
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:31,440
Pika-pi!

1129
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,190
Pikachu! Uhh!

1130
01:08:33,190 --> 01:08:35,030
Pika-pi!

1131
01:08:35,030 --> 01:08:37,530
Aaaaah!

1132
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:38,910
Pika!

1133
01:08:38,910 --> 01:08:41,410
Uhh! Uhh!

1134
01:08:41,410 --> 01:08:42,950
Huh?

1135
01:08:42,950 --> 01:08:44,120
Pika.

1136
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,000
-Oh. Ha ha.
-Bi!

1137
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,370
Celebi.

1138
01:08:47,370 --> 01:08:51,590
Aaaaaah! [Echoes]

1139
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:55,880
Ash!

1140
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:59,260
-Hey!
-Togepi!

1141
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:16,320
Huh? Huh!

1142
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:18,610
You tried to destroy
our forest, mister...

1143
01:09:18,610 --> 01:09:21,410
and we don't take kindly
to that kind of behavior.

1144
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:27,290
Scizor, Sneasel!

1145
01:09:27,290 --> 01:09:28,620
Uhh!

1146
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,750
This is all a mistake--

1147
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:35,960
a big misunderstanding.

1148
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:37,590
Ohh!

1149
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:38,970
Weedle!

1150
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:45,060
I think the Pokemon
understand perfectly.

1151
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:47,220
Ah ha ha ha ha ha!

1152
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:51,900
Suicune!

1153
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:53,190
Thank you!

1154
01:09:53,190 --> 01:09:55,690
Maybe we'll see you
again someday.

1155
01:09:55,690 --> 01:09:57,150
Pika!

1156
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,910
Good-bye, Suicune!

1157
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:13,210
Bi.

1158
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:14,380
-Huh?
-Bi?

1159
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:15,630
Uh...

1160
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,430
Bi-i-i-i-i!

1161
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:24,050
It looks like
Celebi's getting ready...

1162
01:10:24,050 --> 01:10:25,720
to travel back in time...

1163
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:29,060
and I think it wants
to take you along, Sam.

1164
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:32,100
Can you really
bring me back, Celebi?

1165
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:34,310
Bi!

1166
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:38,190
Looks like
you're goin' home, Sam.

1167
01:10:38,190 --> 01:10:40,610
Yeah, I guess so.

1168
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:43,070
Don't worry.
It won't matter...

1169
01:10:43,070 --> 01:10:46,950
'cause wherever you are,
or whenever you are--heh--

1170
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:48,490
we'll always be friends.

1171
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:54,960
Bi.

1172
01:10:58,710 --> 01:11:01,590
Thank you, Ash.
You're a great friend.

1173
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:03,880
Thank you all
for everything.

1174
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:07,300
Maybe I'll see you
again...someday!

1175
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:09,350
I knowwe will!

1176
01:11:16,810 --> 01:11:18,860
I'll see you!

1177
01:11:20,110 --> 01:11:23,150
Good-bye!

1178
01:11:36,790 --> 01:11:39,710
Pikachu!

1179
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:01,730
You were right,
Professor.

1180
01:12:01,730 --> 01:12:04,190
That Pokemon we saw
was a Suicune.

1181
01:12:04,150 --> 01:12:06,490
Yeah, and we met
a Celebi, too.

1182
01:12:06,490 --> 01:12:08,110
It even traveled through time.

1183
01:12:08,110 --> 01:12:09,910
Well, well,
it sounds like you saw...

1184
01:12:09,910 --> 01:12:13,290
some very rare and highly
unusual Pokemon out there.

1185
01:12:13,290 --> 01:12:15,290
Huh? What's the matter, Ash?

1186
01:12:15,290 --> 01:12:16,460
Uh...

1187
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:18,170
You haven't said
a single word yet.

1188
01:12:18,170 --> 01:12:21,250
Didn't you enjoy your little
adventure in the forest, too?

1189
01:12:21,250 --> 01:12:23,210
Oh, sure, Professor.

1190
01:12:23,170 --> 01:12:24,460
But, you see...

1191
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:26,300
I met this Pokemon trainer...

1192
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:27,720
and we got to be friends.

1193
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:29,800
But l--
I just don't think...

1194
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:31,720
I'm ever gonna
see him again.

1195
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:33,100
He decided to go back...

1196
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:35,020
to where he came from,
Professor--

1197
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:36,350
to another time.

1198
01:12:36,350 --> 01:12:37,520
Pika.

1199
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,190
I wouldn't worry, Ash.

1200
01:12:39,190 --> 01:12:40,310
Oh?

1201
01:12:40,310 --> 01:12:42,900
True friendships can withstand
the test of time...

1202
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,940
and I have a feeling
this one will.

1203
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:48,490
I'm sure you and Sammy
will be friends forever.

1204
01:12:48,490 --> 01:12:50,320
Mm. Heh heh.

1205
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:52,700
Thanks, Professor.
I think so, too.

1206
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:54,160
Pikachu!

1207
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:57,870
I think we'd better
get going.

1208
01:12:57,870 --> 01:12:59,920
Yeah, I don't want
to miss the boat again.

1209
01:12:59,870 --> 01:13:01,040
We'll tell you everything...

1210
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:02,790
when we get
to Pallet Town, OK?

1211
01:13:02,790 --> 01:13:05,210
Fine. I'm looking forward to it.

1212
01:13:07,470 --> 01:13:08,550
Hey.

1213
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:10,720
What's the matter, Misty?

1214
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:13,140
Howd Professor Oak
know Sammy's name?

1215
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:14,510
We never mentioned
it to him.

1216
01:13:14,510 --> 01:13:15,640
Yeah, that's right.

1217
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:16,770
[Toot]
Pika!

1218
01:13:18,390 --> 01:13:22,940
Professor Oak's amazing!
He knows everything!

1219
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:25,030
Pika!

1220
01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:26,530
Pikachu!

1221
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:39,210
Hmm. It seems like
it happened only yesterday.

1222
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:51,180
This is amazing.

1223
01:13:51,180 --> 01:13:53,180
This wonderful water's
washed away...

1224
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:55,260
all my annoying aches
and pains.

1225
01:13:55,260 --> 01:13:58,100
I could just float along
like this forever.

1226
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:00,020
Ahoy!
-Huh?

1227
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:02,560
Jessie, thank goodness
you're safe.

1228
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:04,440
Hurry up. Climb aboard.

1229
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,570
What took you so long?

1230
01:14:05,570 --> 01:14:06,730
What have you been doing?

1231
01:14:06,730 --> 01:14:08,610
We had to wait
till it was safe.

1232
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:10,110
But now the coast is clear.

1233
01:14:10,110 --> 01:14:11,320
Oh, good.

1234
01:14:29,550 --> 01:14:31,760
Hey, guys,
I feel all tingly.

1235
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:32,970
So do l.

1236
01:14:32,970 --> 01:14:35,510
Heh. Isn't it fabulous?

1237
01:14:37,470 --> 01:14:41,100
Looks like Team Rocket's
floating away.

1238
01:17:26,770 --> 01:17:28,980
Yo, man,
we forgot to vamp out.

1239
01:17:28,980 --> 01:17:30,690
This ain't
the end of the song?

1240
01:17:30,690 --> 01:17:33,310
-No.
-Oh, man.

1241
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:47,580
