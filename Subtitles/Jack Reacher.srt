1
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:37,425
Move!

2
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,420
It's life or death now, James.

3
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,883
By that,
I mean you're doing one or the other

4
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,140
up in Rockview.

5
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,602
This here is
District Attorney Rodin.

6
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,060
Want to know what he's wondering?

7
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,487
Whether you're gonna walk
like a man or cry like a pussy

8
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,322
on your way to the death house.

9
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,825
See, the D.A. likes the needle,

10
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:47,903
whereas me,

11
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,830
I like to see a man like you
live a long life

12
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:52,829
with all your teeth knocked out.

13
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:57,004
Passed around till a brother
can't tell your fart from a yawn.

14
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,289
Now, I don't know
what kind of man you are,

15
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,166
which of these two fates you prefer,

16
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:05,842
but Rodin here is a generous fellow.
He's willing to let you take your pick.

17
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:11,180
If you save us and this city
a long and costly trial,

18
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:15,644
waive your right to counsel and confess,
right now.

19
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:28,322
Sixteen hours.

20
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,866
Has to be some kind of
record, Detective.

21
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,540
What the hell is this?

22
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,553
Who the hell is Jack Reacher?

23
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,885
Jack Reacher,

24
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:58,398
born Jack, not John, no middle name,
is a ghost.

25
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:03,024
No driver's license, current or expired.
No residence, current or former.

26
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:08,234
No credit cards, no credit history.
No P.O. box, cell phone, e-mail.

27
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:09,908
Nothing.

28
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,528
Can you at least tell me who he is?

29
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,740
Well, I can tell you who he was.
Blood military.

30
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,037
Born and raised on bases abroad.

31
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:20,078
Mother was a French national,
father in the Corps.

32
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,715
His first trip to the United States
was to attend West Point.

33
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:25,709
Four years later, he ships out for good.

34
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:29,679
Iraq. Afghanistan. The Balkans.
You name it.

35
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:32,094
Served with distinction.

36
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:35,431
Silver Star, Bronze Star,
Legion of Merit.

37
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:40,398
Defence Superior Service Medal?
Had to look that one up.

38
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,021
And a Purple Heart.
He spent the bulk of his service

39
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:47,231
in the Military Police.
By all accounts, a brilliant investigator.

40
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,778
Apparently, a troublemaker, too.

41
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,451
Demoted to Captain.

42
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,198
Worked his way back to Major.

43
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:56,619
Then two years ago, he musters out.

44
00:10:56,948 --> 00:11:01,954
After a literal lifetime in the military,
he just up and quits. And then,

45
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,122
for only the second time in his life,

46
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:08,093
he enters the United States
and simply disappears.

47
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:09,877
Dead, maybe?

48
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:11,554
Not according
to Social Security

49
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,552
and a bank account in Virginia.

50
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,929
His pension is deposited monthly

51
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:20,226
and someone is making the occasional
withdrawal. All wire transfers.

52
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,896
I can't find out where
without a federal warrant.

53
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,444
Well, he can't drive or ﬂy.

54
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:27,987
At least not under his real name.

55
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,734
- Any warrants?
- Record's clean.

56
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:35,286
Oh, come on! A guy this hard to find?
Gotta be wanted for something.

57
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,913
His record is clean.

58
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,952
So.

59
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:44,584
How do we find this Reacher'?

60
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:48,167
Obviously, you don't find this guy
unless he wants to be found.

61
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:53,588
Excuse me, sir. There's
a Jack Reacher hereto see you.

62
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,147
Can I help you?

63
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,642
James Barr.

64
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,781
So, now you've seen him.
How do you know him?

65
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,329
Why wasn't he in protective custody?

66
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,575
That was an oversight.

67
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:24,002
More like some Corrections flunky
threw him to the wolves.

68
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:25,954
Just as likely.

69
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,122
But it's done and we can't undo it.

70
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:29,378
So what happens now?

71
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:31,797
Well, now he's in a coma.

72
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:35,631
We'll try him when he wakes up.
If he wakes up.

73
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:37,386
Okay? Now it's your turn, Reacher.

74
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,801
Why did he call you as a witness?

75
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,477
I don't believe he did.

76
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,180
Well, I believe
he asked for you by name.

77
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:45,849
Any chance I could look
at the evidence?

78
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,608
No way.
Not till you answer some questions.

79
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:48,936
Nice meeting you.

80
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,361
- Hey. Hey. Hey!
- Mr Reacher.

81
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,988
- Mr Reacher!
- Hey, stop! Stop right there!

82
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:53,440
We had a deal.

83
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,776
I take you to Barr,
you tell me what you know.

84
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,611
I know you say he shot five people,
I know he's in a coma.

85
00:12:58,695 --> 00:12:59,821
I know there's a bus station
three miles away

86
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:01,740
and I can walk there in 24 minutes.

87
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,207
So you're just going to
walk out on your friend?

88
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,953
- He's not my friend.
- Why'd he ask for you, then?

89
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:09,039
Well, same reason he shot five people,
he's crazy.

90
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,210
Hey. Hold on.

91
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,545
Don't do that.

92
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,335
Well, this is a new low,
even for both of you.

93
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:14,510
Uh-oh.

94
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,304
You do not talk to my client
without me present.

95
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:17,426
You know that.

96
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:20,676
We weren't talking to your client.
He's in a coma, for Christ's sakes.

97
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,261
- You're Barr's attorney?
- Helen Rodin, Jack Reacher.

98
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,180
- Jack Reacher?
- Helen Rodin.

99
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,893
Yeah, she's the
District Attorney's daughter.

100
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,016
It's a good story, actually.

101
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,225
I'd like to hear it.

102
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,436
How'd you find him?
How'd they find you?

103
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:34,064
You can't be talking to this man.
Two strikes in one day.

104
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,906
- It's not what it looks like.
- He came to us.

105
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,777
- You went to the D.A.?
- Ls there a law against that?

106
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,286
None you're currently breaking.

107
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,451
Come on, before this gets awkward.
Now, hey.

108
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:44,870
Say, "See you in court." For me.

109
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:46,538
Goodbye, Detective.

110
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:48,541
- Weird meeting you.
- Likewise.

111
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,962
Let's go.

112
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,046
So...

113
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,554
So, you're Jack Reacher.

114
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,383
- So you're the D.A.'s daughter.
- Oh, Jesus. Please.

115
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,309
- Is that even legal?
- Fortunately.

116
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,724
- How does that happen?
- I'll tell you after deposition.

117
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:06,895
You don't want to depose me.

118
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,097
Oh, well, you're my only
defence witness.

119
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,896
- I'm not a defence witness.
- Your friend James thinks you are.

120
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,477
He's not my friend.
Why does everyone assume that?

121
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:13,603
Well, why else would he ask for you

122
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:14,729
and why would you
come here to help him?

123
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:18,237
I didn't come here to help him.
I came here to bury him.

124
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:44,850
Linsky.

125
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:48,805
Who the hell is Jack Reacher?

126
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,268
- So why are you so hard to find?
- I'm impossible to find.

127
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:54,477
Why is that?

128
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:57,985
Well, you could say it started out as an
exercise and became an addiction.

129
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,150
Are you on the run?

130
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,700
My bus is leaving.
You better hurry, counsellor.

131
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:05,868
How do you know James Barr?

132
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,615
- Why are you representing him?
- I'm a lawyer.

133
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,292
So is a public defender, with just as
much chance of clearing Barr.

134
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:11,790
I'm not trying to clear him,

135
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:14,338
I am just trying
to keep him off death row.

136
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,883
- By proving he's insane?
- Well, that's one option.

137
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:19,628
And sticking it to your father because...

138
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,179
No. Not my father.
The Office of the District Attorney.

139
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,970
Because the Office of the District
Attorney never bought you a pony.

140
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,720
D.A. Rodin's never lost a capital case.
You know why?

141
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,354
Impeccable tailoring.

142
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:33,315
- He never picks a fight he can't win.
- Worked for the Red Baron.

143
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,064
Every murder suspect in this town
is given a choice.

144
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,811
Confess or face death.

145
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:39,231
Against a D.A. who never loses.

146
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,482
My firm has reason to believe
more than one innocent man

147
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,068
has gone down without a fight.

148
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,153
Oh, I get it.

149
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,329
You're an idealist.

150
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:49,665
No. I'm a pacifist.

151
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,250
It's a noble crusade.

152
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:55,247
But this is not the fight. Trust me.
James Barr's guilty.

153
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,211
You haven't even seen the evidence.

154
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,262
Is this a privileged conversation?

155
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:07,100
Of course, it's a client conference.
Nothing you say here can be repeated.

156
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,854
There are four types of people
who join the military.

157
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,727
For some, it's a family trade.

158
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,567
Others are patriots, eager to serve.

159
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,895
Next, you have those
who just need a job.

160
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:23,404
Then there's the kind who want a legal
means of killing other people.

161
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,743
James Barr was one of those.

162
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,071
He made sniper.

163
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:31,408
Trained hard.
Two thousand rounds a week.

164
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:33,834
And with every shot,
he's taught to visualise

165
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,538
the base of a man's skull
through his reticle.

166
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:39,590
The sweet spot where
the medulla meets the spine.

167
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,253
Visualise that puff of pink mist.

168
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,930
Finally, he's deployed to Iraq.

169
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,929
He's put on overwatch.

170
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,429
All day long
he stares through a scope at civilians.

171
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,267
Women.

172
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:55,644
Children.

173
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,772
Day in, day out, for two long years

174
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:01,897
without ever once being
cleared to fire a single shot.

175
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,782
Then comes the drawdown.

176
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,402
For James Barr, the war's over.

177
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,287
Two thousand rounds a week.

178
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:14,243
A quarter million rounds in his career,
not one at a human target.

179
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,620
You've been hungry.
You've been horny.

180
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,298
You've had an itch you can't scratch.

181
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:24,795
Imagine that feeling.
Days. Weeks. Years.

182
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:29,132
Imagine that feeling times 200, 000,
plus 50, 000 more.

183
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:33,345
Imagine it's 130 degrees on the deck
and tomorrow you're going home

184
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,437
and you know if you don't
scratch that itch now,

185
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,140
you never will.

186
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,146
You need a release.

187
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:41,311
You need a target.

188
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:44,614
And the who of it
never once enters your mind.

189
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,833
He covered his tracks well,

190
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,631
just like sane people do.

191
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,886
He almost got away with it, too.
But I caught him. And he confessed.

192
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:12,725
So why didn't he go to prison?

193
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:17,180
What Barr didn't know that day was the
four civilian contractors he'd picked off

194
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:20,559
just spent the weekend
at what they call a rape-rally.

195
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:24,737
It was 28 women,
ages 54 on down to 11.

196
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,820
Those were just the ones I could find
before the case was shut down.

197
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,990
See, the deeper I dug, the uglier it got.

198
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,665
And after seven long years
of "Mission Accomplished,"

199
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:39,335
someone in the corporation just wanted
the whole thing to end quietly.

200
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:43,331
So they chalked it up to the fog of war,
made the murders go away.

201
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,758
This is classified information.

202
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:48,841
And that's why the privilege.

203
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,172
But you were ready
to tell this to the D.A.

204
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:55,226
The last time I saw Barr,
I made him a promise.

205
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:59,184
And when I saw his name on the news,
I came here to keep it.

206
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:03,067
- But now I know I don't have to.
- How can you be sure?

207
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,686
You still haven't seen the evidence.

208
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,741
Your father has.
And he doesn't pick a fight he can't win.

209
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,406
Barr's not getting away
with murder again.

210
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,369
He might.

211
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:18,241
He suffered a severe brain injury
in state custody.

212
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,125
When he wakes up, if he wakes up,

213
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,961
he may not remember the event,
he may not remember anything at all.

214
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,758
And this case won't be about
James Barr's guilt or innocence.

215
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:31,088
It'll be about his ability to stand trial.

216
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:36,392
After everything I just told you,
you still want to defend him?

217
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,561
I want to see he gets a fair trial.

218
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:43,273
You said he confessed in Baghdad.

219
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:45,435
He didn't confess this time.

220
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,816
- This time he knows better.
- This time he asked for you.

221
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,198
I want to know why.

222
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,322
You want to know why.
I can see it's eating you.

223
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,990
And you can't ask Barr,

224
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:58,456
and the D.A. won't let you
see the evidence.

225
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:04,455
My lead investigator has complete
access to the evidence. All of it.

226
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:09,338
- So where's your lead investigator?
- About to catch a bus out of town.

227
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,011
Thanks for the coffee, counsellor.

228
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:18,869
You understand you're not just
asking me to look at the evidence.

229
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:21,747
You're asking me to look
at a cold-blooded killer.

230
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:25,368
A man I know to be guilty.
A man you want to keep off death row.

231
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:28,337
And you're asking me
to look at him objectively.

232
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,381
Yes, that is what I'm asking.

233
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:38,886
I'll do it. On one condition.

234
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:40,891
Name it.

235
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:45,396
You have to look
at the victims objectively.

236
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,400
How do you suggest I do that?

237
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,735
- Yes?
- Mr Farrior?

238
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:57,900
I'm Helen Rodin.
We spoke on the phone.

239
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,244
Of course.

240
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,909
You said you're defending
the man that ki...

241
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,573
That man.

242
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:08,081
I represent James Barr, yes.

243
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:11,247
And you have questions
about my daughter?

244
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,424
I do.

245
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:16,594
What for?

246
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:20,761
I was hoping to get a better sense
of who the victims were as...

247
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:22,850
That is to say, who they were as people.

248
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:24,723
As human beings.

249
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:33,102
That's a bit unusual,
considering your position, isn't it?

250
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,436
That is true.

251
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:38,278
Normally someone in my position
would want the jury

252
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,784
to know as little as possible about the...

253
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,784
The people that your client killed.

254
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,123
In cold blood.

255
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:53,998
Have you spoken
with the other families?

256
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:57,252
Yeah, some.
The ones who would speak with me.

257
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,012
Come in.

258
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:09,480
Thank you.

259
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,767
Chrissie was a nanny.

260
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:13,058
She had a little girl with her that day.

261
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:14,434
Yes, I know.

262
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:19,769
Are you gonna go talk with that child?

263
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:21,775
No, of course not. I...

264
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:23,939
Why not?

265
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,905
- Well, I think it would be...
Insensitive'?

266
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:29,616
Inappropriate?

267
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,792
Everything that you want to know
about my daughter

268
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,121
is right here.

269
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,463
The Gazette did a nice piece on her.

270
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:47,930
Her obituary does the rest.

271
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:54,603
Thank you. I'll definitely have a look.

272
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:57,306
You a good attorney, Miss Rodin?

273
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,643
- That's not really for me to...
- Just

274
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,444
answer the question.

275
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:06,983
Yes, I suppose I am pretty good.

276
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:09,151
Good enough to keep
that man off death row'?

277
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,662
You know,

278
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,455
I think maybe I should go.

279
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,157
You stay where you are.

280
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,840
That man deserves to die, Miss Rodin.

281
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:28,133
Why would you defend him?

282
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:31,341
I can see
that I have made a terrible mistake.

283
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:36,513
And I'm very, very sorry
and I promise I won't bother you again.

284
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,278
Hello, Dad.

285
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:50,701
What the hell are you doing?

286
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,369
What am I... What?

287
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:53,529
Is it true?

288
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,697
You're talking to the victims' families?
You? Alone?

289
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:58,747
How do you know that?
How did you find me here?

290
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,120
I'm the District Attorney.
It's my business to know.

291
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:02,250
That's not an answer.

292
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:06,547
Oh. Well, you're not the only one
with crack investigators, Helen.

293
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,378
That's right. I know about Reacher.

294
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:12,055
Your lead investigator is a war veteran

295
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,721
who's been missing
for the last two years.

296
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:17,637
How can you vouch
for his state of mind?

297
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,062
How can you trust anything he tells you?

298
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,396
You don't know the man.

299
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,727
Tell me this,
does he know you can't pay him?

300
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,233
That your own firm
didn't want this case?

301
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,573
That nobody wants this case?

302
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:33,536
You never even spoke to your client
before he wound up in a coma.

303
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:36,238
Oh, now listen to me! Listen.
Listen, I'm speaking as your father.

304
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:38,449
Whatever our differences
have been in the past,

305
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:40,247
you gotta listen to me now.

306
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:44,588
You're making a terrible mistake.

307
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,424
You cannot win this case.

308
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:51,421
You're going to ruin your career.
Why? For what?

309
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:55,425
To hurt me? To change me?

310
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:57,264
- Helen...
- Don't touch me!

311
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:11,110
Thanks for letting me take a look.

312
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,275
Hey. We love it
when friends of the accused

313
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:15,069
try to tear our work to shreds.

314
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:16,620
He's not my friend.

315
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:19,782
So you keep saying. Find any holes?

316
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,288
Well, you didn't have to
put him in the hospital.

317
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:26,463
Other than that, damn fine police work.
It's open and shut.

318
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,175
What can I say?
The scene was a gold mine.

319
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:33,796
Come on. Now we both know
gold's only as good as the man digging.

320
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:36,800
Yeah, well, anytime you want to come
back, take a look at this stuff...

321
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:38,642
No, thanks. Don't need to.

322
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,469
You never took any notes.

323
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,142
Oh, I don't need to.

324
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:48,311
So you were some real hot shit
in the Army, huh?

325
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:50,279
I did all right.

326
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:53,320
So what does an Army cop do mostly?
Break up bar fights?

327
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:56,819
I did what you do pretty much,
with one minor difference.

328
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:57,986
What's that?

329
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:00,831
Every suspect was a trained killer.

330
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:03,125
Thanks again.

331
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:11,174
Why do you think he paid for parking'?

332
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:14,795
Pardon'?

333
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:18,683
He's about to fire six shots
into a crowd of strangers.

334
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,176
And he's worried about the meter maid?

335
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:23,016
"Simple loony" won't do it for you?

336
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,351
I like to have
at least one alternate theory.

337
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,687
Huh.

338
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:29,689
Habit.

339
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:31,695
Muscle memory.

340
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,356
I don't think he knew he was doing it.

341
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:38,702
Like I said, it's damn fine work.

342
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:40,033
Hey, Army.

343
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:43,699
What's the serial number on the rifle'?

344
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,128
What's the date on the quarter?

345
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:53,546
1968.

346
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,718
Forest for the trees, Detective.

347
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,724
Forest for the trees.

348
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,380
Mind if I share your table?

349
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:20,470
I'm Sandy.

350
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,632
So was I. Last week.

351
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,468
On a beach, in Florida.

352
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:31,564
What's your name?

353
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,980
Jimmie Reese.

354
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,572
You don't look like a Jimmie.

355
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:40,695
What do I look like?

356
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:45,495
I don't know. But not a Jimmie.

357
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:46,996
Hmm.

358
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:48,915
So you're new in town?

359
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:51,001
Usually.

360
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,499
It's kind of loud in here.

361
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:57,837
Do you want to maybe go
someplace quieter? I have a car.

362
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,505
You're old enough to drive?

363
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,763
I'm old enough to do a lot of things.

364
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,682
I'm on a budget, Sandy.

365
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,266
What?

366
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:08,852
I can't afford you.

367
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:10,516
I'm not a hooker.

368
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,182
Oh, then I really can't afford you.

369
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:16,022
Seriously, I work at the auto parts store.

370
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:20,697
What I mean is, the cheapest woman
tends to be the one you pay for.

371
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:24,701
I am not a hooker!

372
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,362
No. A hooker would get the joke.

373
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,535
- What's this?
- He called me a whore.

374
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:34,707
Is that true?

375
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:42,215
Well, nobody said whore.
She inferred hooker, but I meant slut.

376
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:44,213
Hey. That's our sister.

377
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,556
Is she a good kisser?

378
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:49,556
Hey. Outside.

379
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:52,392
Pay your cheque first.

380
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:53,555
I'll pay later.

381
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,228
You won't be able to.

382
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:57,733
You think?

383
00:32:57,893 --> 00:32:59,395
All the time. You should try it.

384
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,980
It's a great joke,
but I'm going to beat your ass.

385
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,815
Do you want to do that here or outside?

386
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,413
Outside.

387
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,331
Stay here, Sandy.

388
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:18,330
I don't mind the sight of blood.

389
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:22,084
When it means
you're not pregnant, anyway.

390
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,772
You still think you're funny now, creep?

391
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:45,441
Shut your mouth, Sandy!
No one is talking to you.

392
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:54,366
It's your last chance to walk away.

393
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,119
Are you kidding? It's five against one.

394
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,130
It's three against one.

395
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:04,464
How do you figure?

396
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,383
Well, once I take out the leader,
which is you,

397
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:11,304
I'll have to contend
with one or two enthusiastic wingmen.

398
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,807
The last two guys, they always run.

399
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,646
Oh, you've done this before?

400
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,223
Yeah.

401
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,643
It's getting late.

402
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,404
Remember,

403
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,569
you wanted this.

404
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:36,120
It's okay. You're okay.

405
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,076
Get up.

406
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:48,503
Okay.

407
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,260
Now we know who's who.

408
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:51,932
Let's get this done.

409
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:09,862
Really?

410
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:15,535
Shit!

411
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:24,881
On the ground!

412
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,963
That's a pretty impressive
response time, fellas.

413
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,380
Do it!

414
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,727
Hands behind your back.

415
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:42,061
Who hired you?

416
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,397
Let's go.

417
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,334
Hey, Helen.

418
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,420
Am I wearing too much perfume?

419
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:08,425
Breathing too sternly.
Detective Emerson.

420
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,253
- Somebody dead?
- And if someone is'?

421
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:16,258
Then they died of shame.
'Cause I was being gentle.

422
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:19,595
I'm starting to understand
why you move around a lot, Reacher.

423
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,684
So no one's dead.

424
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,607
One guy
likely won't ever walk right again.

425
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:27,110
- You want to charge me.
- Very much.

426
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:28,444
But no one's pressing.

427
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:30,280
Sadly, no.

428
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,368
Am I free to go?

429
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:39,118
Hey, Emerson.

430
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,792
4862681.

431
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,627
What's that?

432
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,717
It's the serial number on Barr's rifle.

433
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,467
You're working for me,
do you understand that?

434
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:03,643
So everything you do
is a reflection on my firm. On me.

435
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:04,806
I was set up.

436
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:06,065
You're talking to a lawyer.

437
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:09,065
There was this girl. She came onto me.
Picked a fight.

438
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:10,737
Which never happens in a bar.

439
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,897
She was thrown
when I told her my name.

440
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,156
She was expecting Mike Tyson?

441
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,988
She wasn't expecting Jimmie Reese.

442
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:19,741
Yankees second baseman.

443
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,244
Why did you say you were
a Yankees second baseman?

444
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,164
I always use Yankees second basemen.

445
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:28,497
I didn't say I was a Yankees
second baseman, I just said...

446
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:32,171
Look, the point is,

447
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,173
she was expecting to hear
"Jack Reacher."

448
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,427
She knew who I was.

449
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,505
And the cops were rolling
before the fight even started.

450
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:40,516
And those five guys are her brothers?
Come on.

451
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:44,183
Someone sent those boys
to put me down.

452
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,519
Who'?

453
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,646
If someone followed you
at the river today,

454
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:54,527
it was probably a cop.
And I highly doubt...

455
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,108
There are three things cops never do.

456
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,860
They don't vote Democrat,
they don't drive Cadillacs,

457
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,116
and they never use personal vehicles.

458
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,622
It's not a cop.

459
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,876
A P.l., then, or the D.A.'s office.

460
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,748
You think your father's office
would set me up?

461
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:09,121
Why would anyone set you up?

462
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:10,456
How was your day?

463
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,040
It went exactly the way I think

464
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:14,793
you hoped it would.

465
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:17,925
YOU okay?

466
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:20,094
Mmm-hmm.

467
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:22,805
What'd you learn?

468
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:28,307
Chrissie Farrior was 22.

469
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:33,320
A nanny caring for the six-year-old
daughter of family friends.

470
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:37,407
She'd finally saved enough
money for a trip to China,

471
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,610
in fact, she should have left
the week before.

472
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:44,160
But the girl she cared for wanted
Chrissie to stay for her 7th birthday.

473
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,668
They'd gone downtown that clay
to shop for a party dress.

474
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:56,339
Rita Coronado worked as a cleaning
lady at the River Cross Plaza.

475
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:59,929
She was usually late for work,
but she had a good reason.

476
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,470
Since her son Marco
was nine years old

477
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:06,561
she had to personally drop him at
school to make sure he actually went.

478
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:08,809
But her dedication had paid off.

479
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,691
Marco was now an honour student.

480
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,977
As a reward for all his hard work,

481
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:16,275
Rita was taking him
to his first baseball game.

482
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:20,321
And she was on her way to pick up
the tickets that very afternoon.

483
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:25,368
Nancy Holt's last words to her husband
were a lie.

484
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:27,290
- I love you, babe. See you!
- Bye.

485
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,208
She told him she was
taking her car to be serviced,

486
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:31,537
but in fact, she was headed downtown.

487
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:35,753
It's perfect.

488
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:38,881
She told the clerk she didn't want the
purchase showing up on her credit card.

489
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,134
She wanted to surprise her
husband for their 10th anniversary

490
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,633
- just a few clays away.
- Thank you.

491
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:51,223
Oline Archer never liked
her husband's construction business,

492
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:56,062
even after helping him become one of
the largest contractors in the county.

493
00:39:56,561 --> 00:40:00,611
So it came as a relief when
his failing health and a costly lawsuit

494
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,488
were forcing them
to sell to the competition.

495
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:03,826
Rob?

496
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,696
Help! Help!

497
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:11,327
Her husband
had given his life for the company.

498
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,245
But now that it was hers,

499
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,840
she couldn't bring herself to let it go.

500
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,094
She was on her way
to secure a loan that day

501
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:28,435
so she could keep the business
she'd always hated.

502
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,600
Darren Sawyer was
an investment broker

503
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,773
in the same building where Rita worked.

504
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:37,110
His wife said
he'd grown increasingly distant of late.

505
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:42,028
She can't remember their last words
to one another, but they weren't kind.

506
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,693
Darren's body was found beside
a fresh bouquet of roses

507
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,778
he'd bought that morning

508
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:50,290
and his wife takes comfort
in the fact that, in his last moments,

509
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,954
he was most likely thinking of her.

510
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:15,023
We're gonna be okay.
We're gonna be okay.

511
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:16,475
We're gonna be okay.

512
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,560
We're gonna be okay,
we're gonna be okay,

513
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:20,236
we're gonna be okay,
we're gonna be okay.

514
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,250
So what'd you learn?

515
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,162
You want me to say you were right.

516
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:39,122
You want me to say
that this isn't the fight.

517
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:41,837
James Barr should die.

518
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:44,465
Maybe he should.

519
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:46,421
I meant, what did you
learn about the victims.

520
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,551
What more do you want?

521
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,849
They were five innocent people
senselessly murdered.

522
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,926
I'm sorry.
Could you please put a shirt on?

523
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,515
This is my shirt.

524
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,105
You lose your luggage?

525
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:57,766
I don't have any luggage.

526
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,685
Uh, what was I saying?

527
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:03,355
- Five innocent people.
- Murdered at random, yes.

528
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:09,110
You know how many people
die in this country every year?

529
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:10,782
Two and a half million.

530
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:13,205
That means every day,

531
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:17,119
roughly 7,000 average Americans
wake up for the last time.

532
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:20,501
Last Friday, five of them converged
on a single spot and died together.

533
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:21,622
Is that random?

534
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:23,128
What else would you call it?

535
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:26,427
Well, take Darren and Nancy.
Odds are they were having an affair.

536
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:27,549
Excuse me'?

537
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:30,347
You don't buy roses
for your wife on the way to work.

538
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:32,138
You buy them on the way home.

539
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,811
And you don't worry about a charge
showing up on your credit card

540
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:37,639
when your anniversary is that weekend.

541
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:39,979
Unless it's the gift you're hiding.

542
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,021
And that's why she kept walking

543
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,400
while everyone else ran.

544
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:50,993
You can't prove that.

545
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:54,580
How hard would it be?
Cell phones, e-mails.

546
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,668
All it takes is someone willing to dig.

547
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,828
What's your point exactly?

548
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:04,416
My point is that two of the victims
weren't there strictly by chance.

549
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,260
I need a list of Barr's known associates.

550
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,513
There isn't one. He didn't have any.

551
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,761
He's a classic loner.
He didn't even talk to his neighbours.

552
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,263
He was a quiet man.
Never bothered anyone.

553
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:16,686
Yeah, exactly.

554
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:19,935
- You have his credit card statement?
- I can get it. Why?

555
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:22,312
I need the list
of all the places he hung out.

556
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,860
Bars, bowling alleys, strip clubs,

557
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:26,775
gun ranges.

558
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:28,652
Anywhere someone
would remember him.

559
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:29,903
What do we hope to find?

560
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:32,194
I need some sleep.

561
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,787
You, too.

562
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:36,873
You don't really think I'm gonna...

563
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,623
Be back to pick me up at 7:00.

564
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,387
Yep. Absolutely.

565
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:32,845
Who's with you?

566
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,509
What happened?

567
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,346
Oh, that's him, isn't it?

568
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:39,519
I ain't seeing you, man!

569
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,433
Relax. What happened?

570
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:45,312
Barr's attorney hired an investigator.

571
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,527
Name of Reacher.
Some sort of top-shelf Army cop.

572
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:50,697
He was in Baghdad
the same time as Barr.

573
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:52,527
So'?

574
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:56,369
So Barr asked for this soldier by name.

575
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:59,323
Then he shows up at the river today.
Then up on the highway.

576
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,203
Almost like he knew something.

577
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,706
And you said we don't like
people asking questions.

578
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,207
No, we sure don't.

579
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:07,797
So I took steps.

580
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:10,880
You took steps.

581
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:13,382
Local people. My guys.

582
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,304
And it blew back on you.

583
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:17,932
I figured five guys would do it.

584
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:21,056
Mmm. This franchise
was yours to manage.

585
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:24,229
That's all. Maintenance is our thing,
you understand?

586
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:25,352
Yeah, I understand. I couldn't reach you!

587
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:26,474
Well, that's how this works.

588
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:27,900
Well, I had to make a decision!

589
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,691
- These locals, I want their names.
- It's in the file.

590
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:31,987
Any of them know who you are?

591
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,156
Just one, but I took care of it.

592
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:36,658
You...

593
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:39,529
- Where's the body?
- It's distributed.

594
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:41,785
Relax! No one's gonna find it.

595
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:44,162
- Suppose we want it found, yeah?
- Why the hell would you want it found?

596
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:47,246
'Cause we got a way of doing things
so they stay done.

597
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,088
Clean!

598
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:51,211
A missing person isn't clean.

599
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,759
Christ's sakes, man. You only had to kill
one goddamn person.

600
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:55,256
You tapped five! You call that clean?

601
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:59,512
I call it done. They're looking
at the shooter, not the target.

602
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:00,766
Jesus.

603
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:04,847
We make it messy now
so it won't get messy later.

604
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:08,103
And we don't leave
questions unanswered ever.

605
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:11,276
Okay, all right. Okay. I can fix this.

606
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:14,030
- Open your eyes.
- No, I ain't seeing you!

607
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:16,115
It makes no difference now.

608
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,122
I made a mistake.

609
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:29,875
I mean, you can still use me,
just tell me how to fix...

610
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:33,800
To survive.
Don't say "fix it," because you can't.

611
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:37,129
We covered up the one mess.
You made another.

612
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:38,968
All right. You're right.

613
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:40,548
You're right.
You're absolutely right. I'm sorry.

614
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,305
Just tell me what I have to do.

615
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:47,055
I was in prison in Siberia.

616
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:51,146
I spent my first winter
wearing a dead man's coat.

617
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:53,648
A hole in one pocket.

618
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:55,988
I chewed these fingers off

619
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:59,158
before the frostbite
could turn to gangrene.

620
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:05,165
These I gave up
to avoid working in the sulphur mine.

621
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:09,994
That is how I survived
when so many others did not.

622
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:14,669
A man this rare can always be of use.

623
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,174
So show me. Show me you are rare.

624
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:22,427
Show me you'll do anything to survive.

625
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:25,476
I don't understand.

626
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:28,517
The fingers from your left hand.

627
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:57,341
Have you... Have you got a knife?

628
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:00,135
Did I have a knife in Siberia?

629
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,475
No... Come on, you've got to be kidding.

630
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:08,640
You can do it.

631
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:10,396
Show me.

632
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:43,596
Christ!

633
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,886
Can't! I can't.

634
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:49,139
Always the bullet.

635
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:50,891
- I can't!
- I don't understand.

636
00:48:58,102 --> 00:48:59,775
What do we do about the soldier?

637
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:02,065
What we always do.

638
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:10,828
Barr's credit card statement.
Eyewitness testimonies.

639
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:14,293
Coffee. You take it black, right?

640
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:22,635
Yeah. What can I say?
I take my work home.

641
00:49:36,432 --> 00:49:39,106
Afraid Barr's credit card
statement's a dead end.

642
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:44,065
No bars, no strip joints, nothing.
Pretty much just gas and groceries.

643
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:49,620
I need you to look for gun ranges
between 100 and 150 miles from here.

644
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:52,657
Limit your search to ranges
longer than 300 yards.

645
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:54,078
Sure, if you tell me why.

646
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:56,661
Barr consistently filled
his tank on Saturday,

647
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:58,002
and again on Sunday.

648
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,622
He took a long drive
almost every weekend.

649
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:02,091
- He could be going anywhere.
- Yes.

650
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,174
And if it's bars, bowling alleys
or strip clubs, we'll never find it.

651
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:09,633
But a Match-level gun range?
There might be two.

652
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:13,511
And he made his own bullets.
That means he shot a lot.

653
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:16,018
I'm guessing every Saturday.

654
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:18,603
Maybe with a friend.

655
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:21,435
Why is it so important
you talk to his friends?

656
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:22,645
Assuming he had any.

657
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,355
Drop me at the auto parts store.

658
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,323
I... Wait. Which one'?

659
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,859
I don't know.
She just said "the auto parts store."

660
00:50:28,943 --> 00:50:29,990
She? Who?

661
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,612
Reacher, can you be
a little more specific?

662
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:34,039
I didn't say "an auto parts store."

663
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:37,665
Which one stands out in your mind
as the auto parts store?

664
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:48,880
You want me to wait'?

665
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:52,884
- No, I'll meet you back at the office later.
- How will you get there?

666
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,188
I'll hitch a ride.

667
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:41,936
Can I help you?

668
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:43,313
Sandy work here?

669
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:46,691
What's this about?

670
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:49,941
So she does, thanks.
I need to speak with her.

671
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:51,442
It's a personal matter.

672
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:54,911
- She's on the clock.
- Legal personal matter.

673
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:57,243
What are you, a cop?

674
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,409
Call her out, Gary.

675
00:52:00,743 --> 00:52:03,087
- I'm gonna need to see some I.D.
- Go get Sandy.

676
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:05,623
Well, I need to see something.

677
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:08,759
How about the inside of an ambulance?

678
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:14,761
Okay, I'm calling the police.

679
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:19,470
I don't think Sandy wants
the police involved...

680
00:52:19,595 --> 00:52:20,812
- Hello?
- ...but let's ask.

681
00:52:21,055 --> 00:52:22,102
Hey! You...

682
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:25,310
Hello? I need some help.
Hello? Hey! You!

683
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:29,356
No. You are not allowed
back in here, man!

684
00:52:35,444 --> 00:52:36,616
Shit.

685
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,333
You know this guy'?

686
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:42,664
Tell him.

687
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:45,295
Give us a few, Gary.

688
00:52:57,007 --> 00:53:00,056
Listen, I wasn't... I didn't know.

689
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,726
I didn't know that was going to happen!

690
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:09,566
It was Jeb.

691
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:12,356
The big guy-

692
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:14,363
Jeb Oliver.

693
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:21,665
He told me you were a predator.
You were supposed to start groping me.

694
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,673
Just don't hurt me.

695
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,213
Sandy, sit down.

696
00:53:35,254 --> 00:53:36,346
Where can I find Jeb?

697
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,507
I don't know.
He didn't come to work today.

698
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:39,887
So he works here.

699
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:41,556
Yeah.

700
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:45,560
It's bullshit, though. He cooks crystal.

701
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:47,103
His address, write it down.

702
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:51,896
I'm really sorry, mister.

703
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,574
You were supposed to be a pervert.

704
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,236
And it was an easy 100 bucks.

705
00:53:59,528 --> 00:54:00,575
That's all?

706
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:06,706
When Jeb asks, you do what he says.

707
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:12,591
Am I in trouble?

708
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:17,429
Not if you lend me your car.

709
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:20,636
- I don't have a car.
- Well, sure you do. It's outside.

710
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:22,722
I'm guessing you're the Camaro.

711
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,725
That whimsy little pickup
has Gary written all over it. Keys?

712
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,269
I can't. It's Jeb's car!

713
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:31,648
Well, won't he be surprised
when I drive it home for him.

714
00:54:38,734 --> 00:54:40,111
Who are you, mister?

715
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:41,783
Really?

716
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:51,247
I'm just a guy
who wants to be left alone.

717
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:53,257
I get off work at six!

718
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:58,512
Maybe we could...

719
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:00,635
Sandy, listen.

720
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:04,097
Now, you seem like a sweet girl.

721
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:06,436
You're pretty.

722
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:08,939
You're obviously sharp,

723
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:10,644
doing Gary's books for him.

724
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:13,940
You don't have to
let these guys use you.

725
00:55:16,939 --> 00:55:19,488
It's just what girls like me do.

726
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:24,784
You got money?

727
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:27,161
A little.

728
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:29,997
Get out of town for a couple of days.

729
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:31,541
Why?

730
00:55:33,831 --> 00:55:35,674
Get out of town, Sandy.

731
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:21,424
Is Jeb home?

732
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:30,437
I have a warrant to search the premises.

733
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,903
I see.

734
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:41,569
Well, if you don't mind...

735
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:51,490
Get him! Get him! Get him!

736
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:01,918
I got this!

737
00:59:01,997 --> 00:59:03,044
Okay, okay.

738
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:05,668
All right.

739
01:00:05,477 --> 01:00:06,820
Don't move.

740
01:00:07,479 --> 01:00:08,822
I'll tell you what.

741
01:00:09,481 --> 01:00:12,109
When I move, you pull the trigger.

742
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:14,035
Aah!

743
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:15,408
Aah!

744
01:00:15,654 --> 01:00:17,702
- Where's Jeb?
- He's not here.

745
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:19,124
Where can I find him?

746
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:20,746
Jesus! My hand!

747
01:00:20,826 --> 01:00:23,045
Well, you shouldn't play with guns.
Where can I find him?

748
01:00:23,245 --> 01:00:26,169
- You're the one driving his car.
- You tell...

749
01:00:26,832 --> 01:00:29,130
The last I saw him,
we was all leaving jail.

750
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:30,756
He said he had to see a guy.

751
01:00:30,919 --> 01:00:32,592
- What guy? Who?
- I don't know.

752
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:34,097
I don't know, I swear.

753
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:36,683
Next I know,
his mom woke up from a bender

754
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:37,975
and his shit's all gone.

755
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:40,437
Is he the sort to light out like that?

756
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:43,098
No, no, man.
He'd never leave his moms alone.

757
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:44,433
Shit ain't right.

758
01:00:44,516 --> 01:00:46,268
- Got a car?
- It's outside.

759
01:00:46,518 --> 01:00:47,565
Keys.

760
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:49,362
My hand, man.
They're in my pock... Aah!

761
01:00:49,521 --> 01:00:50,864
Okay, okay.

762
01:00:57,779 --> 01:00:59,372
Now look at your friends.

763
01:00:59,948 --> 01:01:01,165
Now look at my face.

764
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:05,207
Do you ever want to see me again?

765
01:01:05,954 --> 01:01:07,046
No way.

766
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:10,046
Am I stealing your car?

767
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:14,346
Use it as long as you like.

768
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:17,007
You're very kind.

769
01:01:17,257 --> 01:01:18,383
Ah!

770
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:43,954
I think Jeb Oliver's dead.

771
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:47,496
- Who's Jeb Oliver?
- He was the guy from the bar.

772
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,424
Jesus, how hard did you hit him?

773
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:54,594
What? No, not me.

774
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:57,047
No, he was murdered.

775
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:59,007
And someone tried to make it
look like he left town.

776
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:00,592
Well, maybe he just left town.

777
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:02,348
You pack your shower curtain
when you travel?

778
01:02:02,594 --> 01:02:04,642
Is this what you base
your conclusions on?

779
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,519
What is that on your head?

780
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:08,854
Uh...

781
01:02:13,188 --> 01:02:14,565
You don't want to know.

782
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:19,532
You said on the phone
you wanted to submit your findings.

783
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:25,458
James Barr was a sniper.
Not the best, not the worst.

784
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,452
But he trained non-stop for two years.

785
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:28,787
What does training like that do?

786
01:02:28,954 --> 01:02:30,831
What does any training do?

787
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:33,793
Skills become reflex. Muscle memory.
You do without thinking.

788
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:37,470
It also makes people who aren't
necessarily smart seem smart

789
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:39,965
by beating some
tactical awareness into them.

790
01:02:40,215 --> 01:02:42,468
Now, 99% of the evidence
your father has against Barr

791
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:44,143
didn't exist in Baghdad,

792
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:47,189
not because Barr was smart,
but because he was trained.

793
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:51,397
See, from that garage,
the shooter had the sun in his eyes.

794
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:54,654
Targets were moving left and right.
It's difficult conditions for any sniper.

795
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:57,403
But Baghdad, you said Barr
was in a parking garage then.

796
01:02:57,482 --> 01:03:00,201
Because in Baghdad,
the sun's behind him.

797
01:03:00,402 --> 01:03:03,155
Targets coming straight ahead,
single file.

798
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:06,033
Ideal conditions
for even an average shooter

799
01:03:07,075 --> 01:03:08,827
and the exact same conditions

800
01:03:08,994 --> 01:03:11,372
he would've had
up on that highway bridge.

801
01:03:12,247 --> 01:03:15,467
Up there, he would never even
have to get out of the van.

802
01:03:17,002 --> 01:03:18,470
No parking meter.

803
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:19,717
NO camera.

804
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:24,221
No trace evidence left behind.
And his escape is assured.

805
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:26,015
Now, I'm not saying
that he couldn't have killed

806
01:03:26,094 --> 01:03:28,517
those people at the river,
but he wouldn't have.

807
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:29,643
Not that way.

808
01:03:29,723 --> 01:03:31,191
- So you're saying he's crazy.
- No.

809
01:03:31,266 --> 01:03:33,268
Well, what exactly are you saying?

810
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:37,026
Any single piece of evidence I'd buy.
But all of it?

811
01:03:37,105 --> 01:03:39,733
Fibres, fingerprints, stray brass,
I mean...

812
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:41,818
And who the hell pays for parking?

813
01:03:42,027 --> 01:03:44,701
Sane or crazy,
that just doesn't make sense.

814
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:49,455
Okay. So Barr, he wanted to get caught
and he wanted you to catch him.

815
01:03:50,285 --> 01:03:52,379
That would not explain how Barr,

816
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:57,626
an average shooter firing
in poor conditions, never missed.

817
01:03:57,792 --> 01:03:58,964
He did miss.

818
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:00,594
He did.

819
01:04:03,715 --> 01:04:04,932
A pristine bullet,

820
01:04:05,884 --> 01:04:08,353
conveniently trapped
by a liquid backstop.

821
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:12,896
The same bullet that tied
Barr's gun to the killings.

822
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:16,861
And arguably the prosecution's single
most important piece of evidence.

823
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:20,574
If Barr wanted to get caught,
he didn't miss.

824
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:22,534
Either way, it doesn't make sense.

825
01:04:22,734 --> 01:04:25,078
If he wanted to get away with it,
he likely would have

826
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:26,868
and if he wanted to get caught,

827
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:29,791
Barr was incapable of such perfection.

828
01:04:29,908 --> 01:04:31,751
Or maybe he just got lucky,
six shots out of six.

829
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:34,083
That's what I was willing to accept,

830
01:04:34,204 --> 01:04:36,127
then those guys took a run at me.

831
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:38,709
Whoever sent them made a mistake.

832
01:04:38,917 --> 01:04:41,261
It was just a bar fight.

833
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:42,716
Maybe.

834
01:04:43,755 --> 01:04:46,599
Or maybe someone got nervous,
tried to run me off.

835
01:04:47,092 --> 01:04:51,393
Or put me in a coma,
right next to their patsy.

836
01:04:54,265 --> 01:04:55,767
Patsy?

837
01:04:57,102 --> 01:04:59,730
It was such a great crime scene.

838
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:01,781
No one stopped to think
it might be too great.

839
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:03,404
Not Emerson.

840
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:05,239
Not your father.

841
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:07,954
Not even Barr's own defence attorney.

842
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:11,287
But Barr knew I would,

843
01:05:12,951 --> 01:05:15,625
no matter how much
I wanted it to be true.

844
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,332
That's why he asked for me.

845
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:21,297
Wait.

846
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:23,677
Are you suggesting...

847
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:25,926
James Barr is innocent.

848
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:37,104
You can see what this is, can't you?

849
01:05:38,143 --> 01:05:39,611
You've got a case in your hands

850
01:05:39,686 --> 01:05:41,814
that may be
the last case you'll ever have

851
01:05:42,981 --> 01:05:45,780
and you'll do anything
not to hit the bottom of it.

852
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:48,611
Helen.

853
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,455
You know,
you never should have retired.

854
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:53,158
Just, look. Listen.

855
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:54,746
For all I know, you were
standing at an intersection

856
01:05:54,826 --> 01:05:56,043
with a cardboard sign three days ago.

857
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:58,625
And I hired you.
Jesus, my father was right.

858
01:05:59,164 --> 01:06:01,792
- Helen. Helen.
- It makes total sense now.

859
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:03,710
It's the way you live,
the way you move around.

860
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:06,467
You're just not cut out
for the real world, are you?

861
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,048
Are you afraid you'll end up like Barr?

862
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:09,348
- Helen.
- Is that what this is?

863
01:06:09,466 --> 01:06:10,513
Look out the window.

864
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:11,972
No, I have work to do.

865
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:13,303
- And you need to leave.
- Just humour me. Okay.

866
01:06:13,845 --> 01:06:14,892
Let go of me.

867
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:18,482
- Would you tell me what you see?
- I see the same

868
01:06:19,851 --> 01:06:22,149
things I see every day.

869
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:24,355
Well, imagine you've never seen it.

870
01:06:25,857 --> 01:06:28,861
Imagine you've spent your whole life
in other parts of the world

871
01:06:29,194 --> 01:06:31,697
being told every day
you're defending freedom.

872
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:34,161
And finally
you decide you've had enough.

873
01:06:35,033 --> 01:06:38,253
Time to see
what you've given up your whole life for.

874
01:06:38,453 --> 01:06:40,956
Maybe get some of that freedom
for yourself.

875
01:06:42,707 --> 01:06:44,129
Look at the people.

876
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:47,712
Now tell me which ones are free.

877
01:06:49,297 --> 01:06:50,970
Free from debt.

878
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:52,634
Anxiety.

879
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:53,969
Stress.

880
01:06:54,052 --> 01:06:55,304
Feat.

881
01:06:55,386 --> 01:06:59,061
Failure. Indignity. Betrayal.

882
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:04,563
How many wish they were born
knowing what they know now?

883
01:07:04,646 --> 01:07:06,819
Ask yourself how many would do things

884
01:07:06,898 --> 01:07:08,571
the same way all over again?

885
01:07:09,651 --> 01:07:12,029
And how many would
live their lives like me?

886
01:07:15,406 --> 01:07:18,205
Now look at the silver Audi
across the street,

887
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:20,252
the one that's been following me all day.

888
01:07:20,578 --> 01:07:21,921
What does that prove?

889
01:07:21,996 --> 01:07:25,421
Here's the tag number.
How long would it take you to run it?

890
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:28,003
At this time of night?
I don't know. An hour?

891
01:07:28,086 --> 01:07:29,212
Do it.

892
01:07:29,921 --> 01:07:32,515
Do it, and then I'll leave.

893
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:42,938
When?

894
01:07:45,937 --> 01:07:50,192
No, this is my problem now.
I'll handle it.

895
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:53,319
Yeah?

896
01:07:55,446 --> 01:07:56,538
You're blown.

897
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:59,284
The lawyer's running the license plates.

898
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:02,120
Yeah. So do it?

899
01:08:03,871 --> 01:08:04,918
Done.

900
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:09,298
Go to this address.

901
01:08:11,796 --> 01:08:14,424
All right, let's just say
that Barr didn't do it.

902
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:16,392
Or did it 'cause someone
put him up to it.

903
01:08:16,467 --> 01:08:17,639
Either way, what have you got?

904
01:08:17,719 --> 01:08:18,811
Conspiracy.

905
01:08:18,886 --> 01:08:20,684
Yeah, conspiracy to kill
five random people?

906
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:22,060
There's no motive.

907
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:24,484
- It's ridiculous, right?
- It's grassy knoll ludicrous.

908
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:26,394
No point looking any further.

909
01:08:26,561 --> 01:08:27,983
Exactly.

910
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:29,613
Exactly.

911
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:34,573
What's this?

912
01:08:34,736 --> 01:08:36,830
The motive. Just hold onto it.

913
01:08:36,904 --> 01:08:38,121
What are we playing, Clue?

914
01:08:39,991 --> 01:08:41,117
Yeah?

915
01:08:42,493 --> 01:08:43,836
Give it to me.

916
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:50,213
Thank you.

917
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:09,775
You sure
that car was following you all day?

918
01:09:10,021 --> 01:09:11,864
As soon as you picked me up. Why?

919
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:21,954
It's registered to a company
called Lebendauer Enterprises.

920
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:35,888
A conspiracy to kill five random people?

921
01:09:37,215 --> 01:09:38,717
That's ridiculous.

922
01:09:41,219 --> 01:09:42,562
Four.

923
01:09:44,055 --> 01:09:45,898
Four random people.

924
01:09:47,392 --> 01:09:49,520
To hide one specific target.

925
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:17,214
Someone needed
Oline Archer's construction business.

926
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:22,305
And Oline wouldn't let it go.

927
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:34,815
It's a convincing theory.

928
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:39,493
But it's just a theory.

929
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:45,326
The first round is the least accurate.
The snipers call it a cold shot.

930
01:10:45,575 --> 01:10:47,669
Meanwhile, your eyewitness
described a pause

931
01:10:47,827 --> 01:10:50,080
between the first and second rounds.

932
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:53,086
The one shot where the killer
took his time.

933
01:10:53,332 --> 01:10:55,926
And Oline Archer
was the second victim.

934
01:10:56,169 --> 01:10:58,843
The one shot that mattered.

935
01:11:00,673 --> 01:11:02,300
But it's just a theory.

936
01:11:03,676 --> 01:11:05,428
This frame was custom made for Barr.

937
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:08,222
Whoever chose him
knew about Baghdad

938
01:11:08,306 --> 01:11:09,979
and the only one who could have
told him about Baghdad

939
01:11:10,057 --> 01:11:11,604
was Barr himself.

940
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:15,188
He has at least one friend.
A very close one.

941
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:17,865
Now, you find that friend,
you'll find the real shooter.

942
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:19,609
Find the real shooter? Reacher,

943
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:22,536
my job is to present the jury
with reasonable doubt. Period.

944
01:11:22,612 --> 01:11:24,114
What about catching the guys
who really did this?

945
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:26,291
- Catching the guys who did this?
- Bringing them to justice?

946
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:28,459
- No, I can't take this to court.
- Exposing the truth.

947
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:32,209
Even if I believed Barr is innocent,
it's not my job.

948
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:36,714
I am just a lawyer. I'm not a cop.

949
01:11:39,879 --> 01:11:41,881
And frankly, neither are you.

950
01:11:45,718 --> 01:11:47,720
I can't do this any more.

951
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,443
Thanks for the coffee, counsellor.

952
01:12:30,221 --> 01:12:31,393
Sandy?

953
01:12:34,934 --> 01:12:36,402
Wait, it is Sandy, isn't it?

954
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:39,651
Do I know you?

955
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:44,159
Charlie. Jeb's friend?

956
01:12:44,694 --> 01:12:46,412
Oh, come on, don't break my heart.

957
01:12:47,446 --> 01:12:49,039
I'm sorry, I don't remember.

958
01:12:50,116 --> 01:12:51,993
Well, we were both pretty wasted.

959
01:12:53,661 --> 01:12:54,753
Oh.

960
01:12:55,997 --> 01:12:57,840
Yeah.

961
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:01,802
- What, you live here?
- Just up there.

962
01:13:02,128 --> 01:13:03,471
No shit.

963
01:13:04,005 --> 01:13:07,179
I just moved in around the back!
How crazy is that?

964
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,017
It's wild.

965
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:10,140
Yeah.

966
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:14,974
Wow! You look great.

967
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:17,105
Thanks.

968
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:21,364
Well, look, you know,
I don't want to keep you, so...

969
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:23,032
Maybe we can grab a drink sometime.

970
01:13:23,149 --> 01:13:24,571
Yeah, maybe.

971
01:13:25,985 --> 01:13:27,407
Hey, how about tonight?

972
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:30,456
I'm meeting some people.

973
01:13:31,157 --> 01:13:34,206
Okay. Well, some other time, then.

974
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:35,836
Some other time.

975
01:13:35,912 --> 01:13:37,004
Do it here.

976
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:38,168
What?

977
01:14:20,539 --> 01:14:21,711
Reacher!

978
01:14:37,056 --> 01:14:40,731
There's a gun range in Ohio,
targets out to 700 yards.

979
01:14:41,227 --> 01:14:43,901
The only range
that matches your requirements.

980
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:49,989
You should sleep.

981
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:53,159
You have a long drive tomorrow,

982
01:14:53,239 --> 01:14:55,913
and I need to go to city hall
and pull up Oline's legal history.

983
01:14:57,743 --> 01:15:00,917
I wouldn't do that. Not till I get back.

984
01:15:01,414 --> 01:15:04,213
If I'm right,
someone killed four random people

985
01:15:04,291 --> 01:15:06,464
so no one would look directly at Oline.

986
01:15:06,836 --> 01:15:10,340
And if I'm right, just saying her name
could get you killed.

987
01:15:10,423 --> 01:15:13,176
- You saying I should be scared?
- Well, are you smart?

988
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:14,723
Obviously.

989
01:15:14,927 --> 01:15:16,179
Then don't be scared.

990
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:51,134
What exactly am I looking for?

991
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:54,804
Someone who could kill that girl
with one punch.

992
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:58,312
Oh, you want the guy in 1109.

993
01:15:59,138 --> 01:16:00,640
Ernie Johnson.

994
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:03,271
You'll see.

995
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:30,441
Out of the car!

996
01:17:37,403 --> 01:17:40,247
That's our suspect! Move, move!

997
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,183
Suspect is headed north
on State Route 65.

998
01:18:04,263 --> 01:18:05,856
I need backup and air support.

999
01:23:38,138 --> 01:23:39,481
Hold up!

1000
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:41,191
All clear!

1001
01:24:03,372 --> 01:24:06,046
Oh, God,
I just don't believe it. I don't believe it!

1002
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:07,793
I issued the warrant an hour ago.

1003
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:09,298
According to the victim's boss,

1004
01:24:09,378 --> 01:24:11,051
Reacher was seen at her
place of work this morning.

1005
01:24:11,338 --> 01:24:12,806
Where he threatened her boss.

1006
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:15,885
The car he was driving tonight
belonged to a friend of Jeb Oliver's.

1007
01:24:16,009 --> 01:24:17,135
The man he assaulted.

1008
01:24:17,344 --> 01:24:18,971
No, those guys assaulted Reacher.

1009
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:20,931
Reacher put three more men
in the hospital

1010
01:24:21,014 --> 01:24:22,482
this afternoon at Jeb Oliver's place.

1011
01:24:22,558 --> 01:24:24,731
After arriving in Jeb Oliver's car.

1012
01:24:24,851 --> 01:24:27,024
And Jeb hasn't been seen
since he left the hospital.

1013
01:24:27,229 --> 01:24:29,732
Helen, if you know where Reacher is,
you need to tell us.

1014
01:24:29,856 --> 01:24:31,358
I don't know where he is.
I have not seen him

1015
01:24:31,483 --> 01:24:33,906
since he left my office a few hours ago.

1016
01:24:36,029 --> 01:24:38,498
- I think she's telling the truth.
- Oh, you think, Dad? Fuck you!

1017
01:24:38,865 --> 01:24:40,833
Hey, I told you not to go near him.

1018
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:43,332
You come into my home
and you treat me like I'm an accessory!

1019
01:24:43,412 --> 01:24:45,506
- Please! You know...
- All right. All right. Come on. Enough.

1020
01:24:45,581 --> 01:24:46,673
- Look, let me handle it.
- I'm not done.

1021
01:24:46,873 --> 01:24:47,999
You're both done. Just get out.

1022
01:24:53,547 --> 01:24:54,764
This is Helen.

1023
01:24:54,881 --> 01:24:56,303
I'm guessing the police are there?

1024
01:24:56,383 --> 01:24:57,430
Yep.

1025
01:24:57,551 --> 01:24:59,645
By your response I'm guessing
I have about 30 seconds

1026
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:00,937
before you hand them the phone.

1027
01:25:01,054 --> 01:25:02,397
If that.

1028
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:04,316
If you believe someone
could frame Barr,

1029
01:25:04,391 --> 01:25:06,769
you have to believe
they could do the same to me.

1030
01:25:06,893 --> 01:25:08,566
I suppose that's possible.

1031
01:25:09,771 --> 01:25:11,773
She was a sweet kid, Helen.

1032
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:14,943
And they killed her because of me.

1033
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:17,951
They want me to run.

1034
01:25:19,031 --> 01:25:20,032
But I won't.

1035
01:25:20,616 --> 01:25:23,039
- I'm going to finish this.
- No, that's not a good idea.

1036
01:25:23,118 --> 01:25:24,210
Listen.

1037
01:25:24,411 --> 01:25:27,415
Two things. One, I, uh...

1038
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:29,917
I stole your car.

1039
01:25:30,917 --> 01:25:32,590
If you want to end this,

1040
01:25:32,711 --> 01:25:34,054
just hang up the phone
and report it missing.

1041
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:35,301
And I'll understand.

1042
01:25:35,464 --> 01:25:36,807
And anything else?

1043
01:25:37,466 --> 01:25:39,685
I thought I'd be pushing it
if I mentioned this earlier.

1044
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:41,637
Now I guess all bets are off.

1045
01:25:42,095 --> 01:25:44,939
You need to watch what you say
to Emerson and your father.

1046
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:46,562
I think one of them is in on it.

1047
01:25:46,642 --> 01:25:48,986
All right. Thanks for calling. I have to go.

1048
01:25:49,102 --> 01:25:51,150
Wait. I've been followed from day one.

1049
01:25:53,106 --> 01:25:54,779
Only three people knew I was here.

1050
01:25:54,941 --> 01:25:57,160
Emerson, your father and you.

1051
01:25:58,153 --> 01:26:00,030
You need to ask yourself,

1052
01:26:00,113 --> 01:26:01,956
who has the most to lose
if we clear Barr?

1053
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:06,336
Who tried to warn you off me?

1054
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:10,332
Of course, I could be wrong.
If you think I am,

1055
01:26:10,457 --> 01:26:12,084
just hand over the phone.

1056
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:13,669
There's no sense getting any deeper.

1057
01:26:14,961 --> 01:26:16,133
Who's that you're talking to?

1058
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:18,594
The office.

1059
01:26:22,344 --> 01:26:23,812
Are we done?

1060
01:26:24,012 --> 01:26:25,138
Helen, listen.

1061
01:26:25,597 --> 01:26:26,644
- We need to...
- Good night.

1062
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:45,927
You got some fine shooters here.

1063
01:27:46,595 --> 01:27:48,597
Fine as frog's hair.

1064
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:50,273
Rarer, too.

1065
01:27:50,766 --> 01:27:54,066
'Cause most of them fellas out there
can't shoot worth a damn.

1066
01:27:54,603 --> 01:27:58,278
You ask them to put
three rounds in the black, well,

1067
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:00,613
they'll suck it.

1068
01:28:03,069 --> 01:28:06,414
- I'm looking for the owner.
- That'd be me. Martin Cash.

1069
01:28:06,615 --> 01:28:08,117
Aaron Ward.

1070
01:28:08,408 --> 01:28:10,376
What can I do you for,
Mr Ward? Ward'?

1071
01:28:10,452 --> 01:28:14,002
Yeah. I'm looking for a friend of mine.
We served in Iraq.

1072
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,707
The guy just dropped
off the grid, you know?

1073
01:28:16,082 --> 01:28:17,880
- It happens. Yep.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1074
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:19,256
Anyway, he was a shooter.

1075
01:28:19,377 --> 01:28:20,970
Last I heard, he lived
around here somewhere and I...

1076
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:23,097
When did he get out of the Army?

1077
01:28:24,633 --> 01:28:26,306
Well, I didn't say the Army.

1078
01:28:26,426 --> 01:28:29,430
Well, you said you served with him.
You're no jarhead.

1079
01:28:29,638 --> 01:28:32,141
Man on a flying horse could see that.

1080
01:28:32,265 --> 01:28:34,438
Well, my father was in the Corps,
if that helps.

1081
01:28:34,643 --> 01:28:37,487
Well,
that makes you half human.

1082
01:28:39,105 --> 01:28:40,277
Your friend got a name?

1083
01:28:40,732 --> 01:28:42,575
Yeah. James Barr.

1084
01:28:43,819 --> 01:28:45,162
James Barr.

1085
01:28:45,821 --> 01:28:47,073
Never heard of him.

1086
01:28:48,448 --> 01:28:49,950
I think you have.

1087
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:53,002
I think you've been dreading the moment

1088
01:28:53,119 --> 01:28:55,167
some cop comes in here
asking after him.

1089
01:28:55,497 --> 01:28:58,171
Because it's for sure
some soccer mom around here

1090
01:28:58,291 --> 01:29:02,637
is more worried about your range than
she is about the pool in her backyard

1091
01:29:02,838 --> 01:29:05,307
or the drain cleaner under her sink.

1092
01:29:06,842 --> 01:29:10,187
Wouldn't matter to her
if Barr did his killing 100 miles away,

1093
01:29:10,262 --> 01:29:12,139
only that he came here to rehearse.

1094
01:29:12,264 --> 01:29:13,811
She'd have a case to shut you down

1095
01:29:14,683 --> 01:29:16,856
and nothing better to do.

1096
01:29:17,811 --> 01:29:18,858
What do you want?

1097
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,323
I want to know who Barr's friends were.

1098
01:29:26,486 --> 01:29:27,612
Those boys out there,

1099
01:29:28,864 --> 01:29:31,663
they're mighty touchy when it comes
to their constitutional rights.

1100
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:35,871
Suppose I tell them a cop is in here
asking after my members?

1101
01:29:36,037 --> 01:29:37,960
- I'm not a cop.
- What are you?

1102
01:29:38,039 --> 01:29:39,131
I work for Barr's attorney.

1103
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:41,050
We have reason to believe
he's innocent.

1104
01:29:41,167 --> 01:29:42,259
The hell you say.

1105
01:29:42,335 --> 01:29:47,057
Be that as it may, I'm the only one
who's bothered to track him this far.

1106
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:51,846
You help me out, I'll be in your debt.

1107
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:53,312
And if I don't?

1108
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:57,313
Maybe you can coach soccer.

1109
01:30:02,063 --> 01:30:05,067
You put three in the centre
and maybe we'll talk.

1110
01:30:07,861 --> 01:30:09,158
Can I have a few to warm up?

1111
01:31:33,238 --> 01:31:34,956
Six inches right.

1112
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:38,994
That's your mulligan, Mr Ward.
Play ball!

1113
01:31:39,953 --> 01:31:41,296
Let's go.

1114
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:28,839
You're a little rusty, Mr Reacher.

1115
01:32:31,212 --> 01:32:33,840
I saw a man by that name
shoot for the Wimbledon Cup,

1116
01:32:33,965 --> 01:32:35,558
what, ten years ago.

1117
01:32:36,051 --> 01:32:39,021
And I'm pretty sure you never
played second base for the Yankees

1118
01:32:39,554 --> 01:32:41,227
in 1925.

1119
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:43,729
Now,

1120
01:32:44,726 --> 01:32:46,228
I'll answer one question.

1121
01:32:47,353 --> 01:32:48,696
Who's your best shooter?

1122
01:32:50,190 --> 01:32:51,407
James Barr.

1123
01:32:54,903 --> 01:32:57,656
I pulled all these down
as soon as I heard about the shooting.

1124
01:33:02,744 --> 01:33:04,667
That's the best shot

1125
01:33:04,746 --> 01:33:06,919
I ever seen this side of civilian life.

1126
01:33:07,916 --> 01:33:12,342
Suppose I told you Barr wasn't this
good on his best day in the Army.

1127
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:15,515
I handed out those targets myself.
That's my scrawl on every one.

1128
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:17,592
Do you hang them downrange, too?

1129
01:33:17,926 --> 01:33:19,599
What, are you serious?

1130
01:33:20,261 --> 01:33:23,105
I'm saying
it's possible that Barr had a friend.

1131
01:33:23,556 --> 01:33:25,103
One who switched the targets
on the range.

1132
01:33:25,225 --> 01:33:26,568
Maybe Barr let him.

1133
01:33:26,768 --> 01:33:29,942
Made him feel like King Shit
having his name up on your wall.

1134
01:33:30,063 --> 01:33:34,443
I never saw one real shooter
who would do that for his own mother.

1135
01:33:35,944 --> 01:33:38,948
Unless he was framing his mother
for multiple murder

1136
01:33:40,281 --> 01:33:42,124
and using your range to do it.

1137
01:33:45,453 --> 01:33:47,581
Barr didn't come alone, did he?

1138
01:33:49,415 --> 01:33:52,760
You know, one of these nuts is likely
to kill you, they find that camera, there.

1139
01:33:52,961 --> 01:33:54,008
Hell, the camera's there

1140
01:33:54,087 --> 01:33:56,431
'cause one of these nuts
is likely to kill me.

1141
01:33:58,424 --> 01:33:59,596
There's Barr.

1142
01:34:00,635 --> 01:34:02,888
I always liked him. Always liked him.

1143
01:34:02,971 --> 01:34:04,063
There.

1144
01:34:05,098 --> 01:34:06,270
Him.

1145
01:34:09,644 --> 01:34:11,738
That son of a bitch.

1146
01:34:17,652 --> 01:34:19,154
Helen Rodin speaking.

1147
01:34:19,279 --> 01:34:20,952
Got a candidate for our shooter.

1148
01:34:21,156 --> 01:34:23,500
Picture, possible prints

1149
01:34:23,992 --> 01:34:25,994
and one pissed-off eyewitness.

1150
01:34:26,327 --> 01:34:27,749
I can't talk right now.

1151
01:34:28,830 --> 01:34:30,332
Just give me three hours to get back.

1152
01:34:30,498 --> 01:34:32,500
And don't talk to anyone until I get there.

1153
01:34:32,625 --> 01:34:34,468
I'll look into that, thanks.

1154
01:34:35,837 --> 01:34:38,181
This is just
what I could pull this morning.

1155
01:34:38,464 --> 01:34:42,435
Tax records, city and state
permit applications, contract bids.

1156
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:44,228
Shell corporation in Georgia.

1157
01:34:44,304 --> 01:34:46,682
That's the one next to Russia,
not Florida.

1158
01:34:47,473 --> 01:34:51,194
They work one city at a time,
acquiring a local construction concern

1159
01:34:51,477 --> 01:34:53,320
just ahead of major civic redevelopment.

1160
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:57,196
They build bridges no one needs.
Highways no one uses.

1161
01:34:57,525 --> 01:35:02,031
They're like a cancer.
A cell that won't stop growing.

1162
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:07,202
They moved 12 times in 15 years.
Atlanta, Albuquerque,

1163
01:35:07,327 --> 01:35:10,171
Austin, Oklahoma City, Sacramento.

1164
01:35:10,538 --> 01:35:13,382
Always amidst allegations of corruption

1165
01:35:13,499 --> 01:35:16,969
including millions of dollars
in missing public funds.

1166
01:35:17,045 --> 01:35:21,391
And yet never an investigation.
Never even an inquiry.

1167
01:35:21,883 --> 01:35:25,558
It's as if Lebendauer Enterprises
were above reproach.

1168
01:35:29,515 --> 01:35:32,143
Well, maybe that's because

1169
01:35:33,645 --> 01:35:36,023
the allegations come
from the competition.

1170
01:35:37,398 --> 01:35:39,025
Outbid. Bitter.

1171
01:35:39,567 --> 01:35:41,069
Like Oline Archer.

1172
01:35:41,569 --> 01:35:44,994
Or maybe Lebendauer
has the cooperation of key officials.

1173
01:35:45,073 --> 01:35:48,043
And maybe
when that cooperation isn't enough,

1174
01:35:48,409 --> 01:35:51,663
they kill people who won't be bought off.
Like Oline Archer.

1175
01:35:51,746 --> 01:35:53,919
Helen, how much of this
do you honestly believe?

1176
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:56,213
It doesn't matter how much I believe.

1177
01:35:56,918 --> 01:35:58,841
It doesn't even matter
how much I can prove.

1178
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:01,423
It only matters how much is true.

1179
01:36:01,714 --> 01:36:03,716
Do you know how delusional you sound?

1180
01:36:04,217 --> 01:36:05,890
What happened to you?

1181
01:36:06,261 --> 01:36:10,437
Are you really so set on putting
this man to death that you'd ignore...

1182
01:36:21,776 --> 01:36:24,950
I pulled all of this paper
under my own name.

1183
01:36:25,947 --> 01:36:27,790
If Jack Reacher's right,

1184
01:36:28,283 --> 01:36:31,628
my life, your daughter's life,

1185
01:36:32,287 --> 01:36:34,130
is in danger now.

1186
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:37,792
Whatever happens to me next
is on your head,

1187
01:36:38,251 --> 01:36:40,219
whether you're involved or not.

1188
01:36:42,964 --> 01:36:47,060
You are the District Attorney
and I've given you compelling evidence

1189
01:36:47,135 --> 01:36:49,058
to investigate Lebendauer Enterprises.

1190
01:36:49,470 --> 01:36:53,316
Your next move
will tell me which side you're on.

1191
01:36:53,933 --> 01:36:54,980
Oh.

1192
01:36:56,144 --> 01:36:57,612
I see. It's a test.

1193
01:36:58,771 --> 01:37:03,652
Well, this may be hard for you
to believe, but I do love you.

1194
01:37:05,653 --> 01:37:08,156
And obviously I'm not
going to turn a blind eye,

1195
01:37:08,281 --> 01:37:10,659
no matter how absurd I find all of this.

1196
01:37:11,993 --> 01:37:15,623
So, if you really believe
that you're in danger,

1197
01:37:15,997 --> 01:37:17,499
if you believe that,

1198
01:37:18,833 --> 01:37:20,961
then the next order of business,

1199
01:37:22,003 --> 01:37:25,177
is to put you
in protective custody right now.

1200
01:37:28,343 --> 01:37:30,266
And how safe will I be
if you're part of it?

1201
01:37:30,678 --> 01:37:32,305
Jesus, Helen.

1202
01:38:22,730 --> 01:38:24,323
Oh. Hey.

1203
01:38:33,408 --> 01:38:35,035
Business meeting or personal?

1204
01:38:35,243 --> 01:38:37,245
Hard to tell them apart.

1205
01:38:37,703 --> 01:38:39,080
I'll bet.

1206
01:39:41,267 --> 01:39:42,314
Helen?

1207
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:43,561
No.

1208
01:39:45,271 --> 01:39:46,614
Sorry, wrong number.

1209
01:39:46,939 --> 01:39:48,566
Is this Reacher?

1210
01:39:50,943 --> 01:39:52,069
Who is this?

1211
01:39:55,281 --> 01:39:57,625
Is this Reacher?

1212
01:40:02,455 --> 01:40:05,584
It's you. The guy from the car.

1213
01:40:08,085 --> 01:40:09,302
It's your boyfriend.

1214
01:40:11,130 --> 01:40:12,473
Reacher, is it you?

1215
01:40:14,091 --> 01:40:15,092
Helen, are you hurt?

1216
01:40:15,301 --> 01:40:17,269
Well, she's gonna be
if you're not here in one hour.

1217
01:40:18,095 --> 01:40:20,143
Do I have to tell you how this works?

1218
01:40:20,264 --> 01:40:22,062
You'll bounce me around
to make sure I'm not followed,

1219
01:40:22,141 --> 01:40:24,610
then walk me into
an ambush and kill me.

1220
01:40:24,810 --> 01:40:26,983
Aw, you ruined my surprise.

1221
01:40:27,271 --> 01:40:28,944
Well, I can do one better.

1222
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:31,659
I went down to the gun range
at Hinge Creek.

1223
01:40:32,276 --> 01:40:35,621
I got the picture, prints,
and I'm going to the Feds.

1224
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:37,453
The lawyer's all yours.

1225
01:40:41,953 --> 01:40:43,000
Get the Zec.

1226
01:40:52,463 --> 01:40:54,511
On second thought, I'd like to kill you.

1227
01:40:54,799 --> 01:40:56,221
Let's say winner take all.

1228
01:40:56,300 --> 01:40:57,347
Listen to me, you prick.

1229
01:40:57,468 --> 01:40:59,141
I will kill this bitch
if you're not here in one...

1230
01:41:00,846 --> 01:41:02,143
Shit!

1231
01:41:08,521 --> 01:41:10,148
You think I'm a hero?

1232
01:41:10,356 --> 01:41:14,202
I am not a hero.
I'm a drifter with nothing to lose.

1233
01:41:14,527 --> 01:41:17,371
You killed that girl to put me in a frame.

1234
01:41:17,488 --> 01:41:21,493
I mean to beat you to death
and drink your blood from a boot.

1235
01:41:22,368 --> 01:41:26,043
Now, this is how it's going to work.
You're gonna give me the address

1236
01:41:26,205 --> 01:41:28,628
and I'll be along
when I am damn good and ready.

1237
01:41:28,708 --> 01:41:30,961
If she doesn't answer the phone
when I call this number,

1238
01:41:31,043 --> 01:41:32,886
if I even think you've hurt her,

1239
01:41:33,212 --> 01:41:34,714
I disappear.

1240
01:41:34,839 --> 01:41:39,640
And if you're smart, that scares you,
because I'm in your blind spot

1241
01:41:39,719 --> 01:41:41,847
and I have nothing better to do.

1242
01:41:50,062 --> 01:41:51,109
You got a pen?

1243
01:41:53,232 --> 01:41:54,575
Don't need one.

1244
01:42:58,964 --> 01:43:03,470
If I had a dollar for every time
the Army called the Corps for help.

1245
01:43:05,805 --> 01:43:07,648
- You have something for me?
- Yeah.

1246
01:43:08,307 --> 01:43:09,775
Here.

1247
01:43:14,271 --> 01:43:15,318
You're kidding, right'?

1248
01:43:15,439 --> 01:43:16,907
Just because I saw you
shoot ten years ago

1249
01:43:16,982 --> 01:43:20,452
doesn't mean I'll let you
kill some asshole with my gun.

1250
01:43:20,653 --> 01:43:22,371
I told you how serious this was.

1251
01:43:22,655 --> 01:43:24,328
And I showed up, didn't I?

1252
01:43:25,157 --> 01:43:26,329
So let's get to it.

1253
01:43:28,285 --> 01:43:29,332
Now, your shooter will be

1254
01:43:29,829 --> 01:43:32,924
right up there
behind those lights. Okay?

1255
01:43:32,998 --> 01:43:35,968
He can cover both roads
coming and going.

1256
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:39,839
And kill you
just as soon as you stand up.

1257
01:43:39,964 --> 01:43:41,136
Well, can you take him out?

1258
01:43:41,674 --> 01:43:42,926
What, to dinner you mean?

1259
01:43:45,010 --> 01:43:49,356
Look, I don't know the type of people
you normally associate with, Reacher.

1260
01:43:49,682 --> 01:43:54,688
But I'm not in the habit of driving out
to the boonies at the drop of a hat

1261
01:43:55,146 --> 01:43:58,491
and just picking off
some total strangers, all right?

1262
01:43:59,358 --> 01:44:02,202
Anyway, I can't see anything,
not with them lights up.

1263
01:44:02,319 --> 01:44:03,866
So shoot them out.

1264
01:44:04,655 --> 01:44:07,408
Yeah, sure.
And then he knows right where I am.

1265
01:44:07,491 --> 01:44:09,493
I might as well set myself on fire.

1266
01:44:10,536 --> 01:44:13,415
No, sir. I'll start shooting when he does.

1267
01:44:16,041 --> 01:44:18,169
And how do you propose
we get him started?

1268
01:44:18,711 --> 01:44:22,511
Well, you could always start running.

1269
01:44:30,014 --> 01:44:31,561
What's wrong with your eye?

1270
01:44:31,682 --> 01:44:33,355
I'm saving my night vision.

1271
01:44:36,395 --> 01:44:40,571
Hey, Gunny, you mind if I ask you
kind of a personal question?

1272
01:44:40,691 --> 01:44:42,534
What, you don't think
I can shoot any more?

1273
01:44:43,235 --> 01:44:44,862
It is a perishable skill.

1274
01:44:45,738 --> 01:44:47,081
Yeah, well,

1275
01:44:47,656 --> 01:44:49,750
the sun will be up in an hour.

1276
01:44:51,243 --> 01:44:52,586
Let's get going-

1277
01:45:09,595 --> 01:45:11,768
I heard them call you the Zec.

1278
01:45:12,556 --> 01:45:13,899
That means "prisoner."

1279
01:45:15,768 --> 01:45:16,940
Yes'?

1280
01:45:19,855 --> 01:45:21,277
Tell me, killing all those people,

1281
01:45:22,024 --> 01:45:23,526
I have to believe the money
you're making

1282
01:45:23,609 --> 01:45:25,031
can't possibly be enough to just...

1283
01:45:25,110 --> 01:45:26,362
Enough?

1284
01:45:26,612 --> 01:45:28,455
There is no such thing.

1285
01:45:28,781 --> 01:45:30,783
We take what can be taken.

1286
01:45:31,116 --> 01:45:32,663
This is what we do.

1287
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:36,463
And you?

1288
01:45:38,123 --> 01:45:40,717
This one I think I understand, but you?

1289
01:45:41,377 --> 01:45:42,469
Why'd you do n?

1290
01:45:42,795 --> 01:45:45,139
You make it sound like I had a choice.

1291
01:45:45,297 --> 01:45:46,469
Oh, didn't you?

1292
01:45:49,969 --> 01:45:51,312
You'll see.

1293
01:45:55,140 --> 01:45:58,485
You should know I've taken steps,
that if anything happens...

1294
01:45:58,561 --> 01:46:02,282
If anything happens to you,
it will happen in front of your father

1295
01:46:02,398 --> 01:46:04,446
while he begs for your life.

1296
01:46:06,652 --> 01:46:08,996
You should never have involved him.

1297
01:46:09,321 --> 01:46:13,042
Now you will have to convince him
to forget, for your sake

1298
01:46:13,117 --> 01:46:15,370
and for his.

1299
01:46:16,245 --> 01:46:19,920
You say nothing,
but I see defiance in your eyes.

1300
01:46:20,666 --> 01:46:23,510
That is a look I have seen
many, many times.

1301
01:46:23,836 --> 01:46:26,180
When the soldier comes,

1302
01:46:26,255 --> 01:46:28,678
when you watch how he dies,
it will change you.

1303
01:46:29,174 --> 01:46:31,393
You will want to forget me then.

1304
01:46:42,187 --> 01:46:43,439
Reacher?

1305
01:46:43,522 --> 01:46:44,865
Are you okay?

1306
01:46:45,107 --> 01:46:46,324
They're ready for you.

1307
01:46:47,276 --> 01:46:48,903
They'd like to think so.

1308
01:46:49,862 --> 01:46:52,365
Don't do this.
Please don't do this. Not for me.

1309
01:46:52,448 --> 01:46:54,075
Listen, Helen, they're not gonna

1310
01:46:54,199 --> 01:46:58,170
hurt you until they have me.
And that's never going to happen.

1311
01:46:58,370 --> 01:46:59,542
You hear me?

1312
01:47:00,623 --> 01:47:01,715
You just hang in there.

1313
01:47:03,542 --> 01:47:05,385
'Cause I'm coming to get you.

1314
01:47:07,129 --> 01:47:08,472
Now say you believe me.

1315
01:47:09,965 --> 01:47:11,342
I believe you.

1316
01:47:43,165 --> 01:47:45,042
This was a bad idea.

1317
01:48:03,936 --> 01:48:05,563
Any time now, Gunny.

1318
01:48:20,619 --> 01:48:22,212
Shit.

1319
01:48:33,882 --> 01:48:35,429
Where the hell are you, Gunny?

1320
01:52:53,725 --> 01:52:55,398
Suck it!

1321
01:53:06,571 --> 01:53:08,073
You should go.

1322
01:53:51,283 --> 01:53:52,626
Toss it.

1323
01:56:51,046 --> 01:56:53,140
I know you're in there, Emerson.

1324
01:56:56,968 --> 01:56:59,642
It was staring me right in the face.

1325
01:57:01,306 --> 01:57:04,810
The one piece that just didn't fit.

1326
01:57:05,644 --> 01:57:07,112
The quarter.

1327
01:57:09,481 --> 01:57:12,451
Nobody would have thought
to dump that meter.

1328
01:57:14,152 --> 01:57:15,654
Not even me.

1329
01:57:59,155 --> 01:58:01,157
You were wrong about my father.

1330
01:58:03,159 --> 01:58:05,287
I wouldn't make a big thing of it.

1331
01:58:22,637 --> 01:58:23,854
Who is he?

1332
01:58:23,972 --> 01:58:25,519
That's John Doe Number Two.

1333
01:58:25,682 --> 01:58:28,856
The man on the grassy knoll.
The thing under the bed.

1334
01:58:30,020 --> 01:58:31,693
They call him the Zec.

1335
01:58:31,980 --> 01:58:34,199
Zec? Prisoner.

1336
01:58:35,317 --> 01:58:36,694
What's your real name?

1337
01:58:39,863 --> 01:58:41,615
I was born in October.

1338
01:58:41,698 --> 01:58:44,042
When I get to my birthday,
I'm gonna pull the trigger.

1339
01:58:44,367 --> 01:58:46,290
One. Two.

1340
01:58:46,369 --> 01:58:49,999
Chelovek. Zec Chelovek.

1341
01:58:51,708 --> 01:58:53,210
Chelovek?

1342
01:58:53,877 --> 01:58:55,379
Chelovek? Human.

1343
01:58:57,380 --> 01:58:58,927
Prisoner Human Being.

1344
01:59:00,050 --> 01:59:03,395
- That's your real name?
- That is all I remember.

1345
01:59:06,556 --> 01:59:08,024
Call the police.

1346
01:59:11,561 --> 01:59:13,359
Were you really going to shoot him?

1347
01:59:15,065 --> 01:59:16,908
I knew I wouldn't have to.

1348
01:59:18,026 --> 01:59:21,906
One look at this guy and you know
he'll do anything to survive.

1349
01:59:22,238 --> 01:59:24,411
One look at me
and you know I'm not bluffing.

1350
01:59:24,699 --> 01:59:27,202
Yes, I have an emergency at...

1351
01:59:28,078 --> 01:59:29,375
Yes, I'll hold.

1352
01:59:33,083 --> 01:59:34,426
We're in no hurry.

1353
01:59:37,045 --> 01:59:39,264
With a name like yours,
you're gonna feel right at home.

1354
01:59:39,589 --> 01:59:42,263
Prison? In America?

1355
01:59:42,759 --> 01:59:46,935
A retirement home.
If I go to prison at all.

1356
01:59:47,055 --> 01:59:48,227
You think you're gonna walk?

1357
01:59:48,431 --> 01:59:51,105
You are a homeless drifter
wanted for murder.

1358
01:59:51,434 --> 01:59:55,780
Meanwhile, I am an old man
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

1359
01:59:56,106 --> 02:00:00,202
Thanks to you,
who is left to say otherwise? Who?

1360
02:00:00,276 --> 02:00:04,122
Yes, hello? Yes, there's...
I have an emergency.

1361
02:00:04,239 --> 02:00:06,287
We'll see which one of us
goes to prison.

1362
02:00:06,449 --> 02:00:08,952
There are maybe
three, four people dead.

1363
02:00:10,495 --> 02:00:11,963
- Okay_
My bet?

1364
02:00:13,623 --> 02:00:15,000
Neither one.

1365
02:00:18,128 --> 02:00:19,675
What did you do?

1366
02:00:24,134 --> 02:00:25,681
What's it look like?

1367
02:00:27,429 --> 02:00:28,476
What about the truth?

1368
02:00:28,972 --> 02:00:31,395
What about getting the guys
who really did this?

1369
02:00:31,474 --> 02:00:33,476
What about bringing him to justice?

1370
02:00:34,644 --> 02:00:36,271
I just did.

1371
02:00:43,820 --> 02:00:46,949
What about clearing Barr?
What about clearing you?

1372
02:00:47,157 --> 02:00:48,750
I have faith you'll sort it out.

1373
02:00:48,825 --> 02:00:50,668
And I hear you have an in
with the local D.A.

1374
02:00:50,785 --> 02:00:53,004
But what happens to you
in the meantime?

1375
02:00:53,163 --> 02:00:55,006
I keep moving. Same as always.

1376
02:00:55,123 --> 02:00:57,296
Wait, is that my car?

1377
02:01:04,257 --> 02:01:05,304
This the lady?

1378
02:01:06,176 --> 02:01:08,349
Helen Rodin, Martin Cash.

1379
02:01:08,678 --> 02:01:09,804
A pleasure.

1380
02:01:11,181 --> 02:01:13,354
You look like hell there, Army.

1381
02:01:13,475 --> 02:01:17,150
You asked if I was afraid
I'd end up like Barr. I'm not.

1382
02:01:17,353 --> 02:01:19,196
I'm afraid I'll end up like this guy.

1383
02:01:19,314 --> 02:01:22,113
There's a lot of dead bodies out here.
So let's get to it.

1384
02:01:22,192 --> 02:01:25,036
- We should probably go.
- Wait. That's it?

1385
02:01:25,528 --> 02:01:26,700
It's just over?

1386
02:01:27,822 --> 02:01:29,540
You'll be all right, counsellor.

1387
02:01:29,699 --> 02:01:32,373
No. What if I need you?
How will I find you?

1388
02:01:32,660 --> 02:01:33,877
You don't need me.

1389
02:01:35,497 --> 02:01:36,794
Not any more.

1390
02:01:39,375 --> 02:01:40,718
Get her number. Let's go!

1391
02:01:57,227 --> 02:01:59,229
I'm Helen Rodin, your attorney.

1392
02:02:00,230 --> 02:02:03,985
This conversation is protected
by attorney-client privilege.

1393
02:02:04,067 --> 02:02:05,068
You understand what that means?

1394
02:02:05,193 --> 02:02:06,240
Yeah.

1395
02:02:06,319 --> 02:02:08,572
Now, the police didn't
talk to you, did they?

1396
02:02:08,738 --> 02:02:10,581
They're not allowed
to do that without me here.

1397
02:02:14,577 --> 02:02:16,250
How bad was it'?

1398
02:02:18,248 --> 02:02:19,591
How many did I...

1399
02:02:20,750 --> 02:02:22,752
You don't remember
anything about the incident?

1400
02:02:26,381 --> 02:02:27,428
No.

1401
02:02:28,925 --> 02:02:32,099
But I could hear the nurses
talking to those cops out there.

1402
02:02:36,266 --> 02:02:38,439
I don't even
remember wanting to do it!

1403
02:02:43,940 --> 02:02:45,283
Look, I'm not gonna fight this.

1404
02:02:46,776 --> 02:02:49,120
If they say I done it, then I did.

1405
02:02:49,779 --> 02:02:51,452
I done things before.

1406
02:02:54,117 --> 02:02:55,460
I did something bad.

1407
02:02:58,121 --> 02:02:59,293
Real bad.

1408
02:03:03,126 --> 02:03:04,799
A long time ago.

1409
02:03:08,298 --> 02:03:09,971
And I got away with it.

1410
02:03:17,640 --> 02:03:18,812
James,

1411
02:03:19,142 --> 02:03:20,985
how well do you know this place?

1412
02:03:32,280 --> 02:03:33,657
Pretty well.

1413
02:03:34,324 --> 02:03:35,826
And how do you think
you would have done it?

1414
02:03:39,495 --> 02:03:40,838
I guess

1415
02:03:46,836 --> 02:03:48,838
I would have parked up on the highway.

1416
02:03:49,297 --> 02:03:51,846
The sun would be at my back
that time of day.

1417
02:03:53,509 --> 02:03:54,635
I got a van.

1418
02:03:55,970 --> 02:03:57,643
Set up in back.

1419
02:03:58,348 --> 02:04:00,692
Wouldn't have to worry about my brass.

1420
02:04:02,518 --> 02:04:04,520
Get away real clean, too.

1421
02:04:08,024 --> 02:04:10,026
That sound about right?

1422
02:04:11,527 --> 02:04:13,700
Sounds as if you know your stuff.

1423
02:04:18,660 --> 02:04:20,037
I forget your name.

1424
02:04:20,703 --> 02:04:22,046
It's Helen.

1425
02:04:23,706 --> 02:04:25,049
Helen Rodin.

1426
02:04:30,672 --> 02:04:32,845
You're going to be okay, James.

1427
02:04:34,008 --> 02:04:35,726
I am gonna take care of you.

1428
02:04:35,885 --> 02:04:37,387
You can't protect me.

1429
02:04:40,682 --> 02:04:42,025
NO one can.

1430
02:04:42,225 --> 02:04:43,568
From what?

1431
02:04:45,019 --> 02:04:46,066
From who'?

1432
02:04:47,563 --> 02:04:49,236
There's this guy.

1433
02:04:52,902 --> 02:04:54,404
He's a kind of cop.

1434
02:04:56,364 --> 02:04:58,037
At least he used to be.

1435
02:04:59,242 --> 02:05:01,244
He doesn't care about the law.

1436
02:05:02,912 --> 02:05:04,914
He doesn't care about proof.

1437
02:05:06,040 --> 02:05:07,758
He only cares about what's right.

1438
02:05:08,084 --> 02:05:09,927
Look at me
when I'm talking to you!

1439
02:05:10,253 --> 02:05:11,755
He knows what I did.

1440
02:05:13,715 --> 02:05:14,762
He knows where I am.

1441
02:05:16,384 --> 02:05:19,263
And this guy, he made me a promise.

1442
02:05:19,554 --> 02:05:20,601
I said, shut your mouth!

1443
02:05:21,764 --> 02:05:23,937
If I ever got in trouble again,

1444
02:05:25,601 --> 02:05:26,944
he'd be there.
