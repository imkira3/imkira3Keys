1
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,845
(Compere) Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:54,971 --> 00:01:00,434
please welcome on stage
Mr Nice himself, Howard Marks.

3
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,312
- (Cheering and whistling)
- Thank you.

4
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:15,616
Thank you, thank you.

5
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,536
Any, erm...

6
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:22,581
Any plain-clothes policemen in tonight?

7
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:24,500
(Tittering)

8
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:27,628
No, seriously, are there any
plain-clothes policemen in tonight?

9
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,755
(Audience) No!

10
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,965
- Are you sure?
- (Laughter)

11
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:37,471
- Are there any dope smokers in tonight?
- (Audience cheer)

12
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,985
I came from Kenfig HiII
in the Welsh valleys.

13
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,279
There were more pubs than chapeIs,

14
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:56,782
more coal mines than schools.

15
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,913
16 per cent.

16
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,625
Marks, very good.

17
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,252
98 per cent.

18
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:11,421
Swot!

19
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,300
Sissy boy!

20
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,561
Are you all right, love?

21
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,827
Howard, bach, you're not well at all, man.

22
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,086
It was 104 five minutes ago.
I took it myself.

23
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:56,633
Well, it could be undulant fever.

24
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:59,595
No more rugby for you this term, boyo.

25
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:04,266
I'll make sure there's a prescription
down the chemist for him.

26
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:11,773
- Do you know what a scalar field is?
- No.

27
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,358
- No?
- No.

28
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:17,571
Do you know what a...vector is?

29
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,157
No idea.

30
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,659
- They sound like monsters, don't they?
- Yeah.

31
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:26,622
l learned a few things
and I got grade As in aII my subjects.

32
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:29,249
To my overwhelming surprise,

33
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:33,170
the headmaster took me aside one day
and said he wanted me to sit

34
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:36,757
the Oxford University
entrance schoIarship examination.

35
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:40,719
(TV) Oxford is the most traumatic
experience England has to offer its young.

36
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:44,973
I was there between 1945 and '48

37
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:48,393
and I've had to live ever since
with the conviction

38
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:53,357
that nothing in my after life
has in any way topped

39
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:56,443
the exhilaration,
the privilege that I felt then.

40
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:01,073
To my even greater surprise,
l was called up for an interview.

41
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,291
Where are you from, then?

42
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:15,337
- Garw.
- What?

43
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:21,343
Garw.

44
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:24,346
I'm sorry? I can't understand you.

45
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,060
- Garw, I said. It's in Wales.
- Mr Locke.

46
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,439
Where are you from?

47
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,650
Eton.

48
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,919
You open it.

49
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,885
Howard,

50
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:07,014
I don't know what to say.

51
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,769
- You've done it, son! You've done it!
- No, no, no!

52
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:15,605
- Yes! Well done.
- I knew it, Dad. I knew I'd do it.

53
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,150
Mum! Mum! Where's Mum?

54
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,235
Come on, we're late.

55
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,446
Ten minutes. We've got ten minutes.

56
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,283
Come on, Mum.

57
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:29,286
My success went compIeteIy to my head

58
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:33,248
and I've been Iiving off it,
to some extent, ever since.

59
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,584
(Speaks Welsh)

60
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:43,175
- Who's got the ticket?
- Don't be stupid.

61
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,177
I... You've got the ticket.

62
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,762
He's got the ticket.

63
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,011
- Oh, hello.
- All right?

64
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,013
I'm your scout, George.

65
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:35,519
I... I make the beds and do the dishes
and clean up the room.

66
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:39,523
- Oh, you don't have to do that, man...
- Oh, I do, Mr...?

67
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,858
Marks. Howard. Call me Howard.

68
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:46,279
No ladies in here after dinner.

69
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,407
Oh, no. No, no.

70
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,367
Right, OK.

71
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:55,205
I've never had anyone
do anything for me before, you know.

72
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:59,167
I've never...
had a porter carry my bags.

73
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:03,255
Never had waiter service in a restaurant.
Never stayed in a hotel.

74
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:06,800
Smart lad like you, Howard,

75
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,511
time you got used to it!

76
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,721
- Yeah.
- Bye.

77
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,314
(Tapping)

78
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,944
(Whispering) Come on. Come on.

79
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,948
- Come on.
- Hello?

80
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,575
- Come on!
- Come on, what?

81
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,785
Open!

82
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:34,870
Oh, sorry.

83
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,330
What are you doing?
I don't wanna get caught.

84
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,207
Oh, fuck.

85
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,585
- Let me, erm...help you.
- Just... OK.

86
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,670
- Careful.
- Yeah, that's it. OK.

87
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,923
- Just ssh! OK?
- Right.

88
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,718
- Put the bar back.
- Right.

89
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,183
Er...

90
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,019
Hello?

91
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,821
(Knocking on door) Come on.

92
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:37,599
- Who the fuck are you?
- (Girl) He's the new doorkeeper.

93
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:44,356
Are you in room 1-1 1?

94
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,944
Come in.

95
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,614
Close the door.

96
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,408
Dig this.

97
00:08:56,702 --> 00:09:01,831
"The soft vibrations of desire,

98
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:07,504
"given with meat hand and cock."

99
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:15,387
- "Desire taken with mouth and ass."
- (Girl giggles)

100
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:19,099
"Desire returned to the last sigh!"

101
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:24,688
"And the happy laugh of innocent babies."

102
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:42,289
- Have a toke.
- A what?

103
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,832
A drag.

104
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:47,085
I don't take drugs. I mean, I...
I've never tried it.

105
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,839
I'm not gonna get hooked now, am I?

106
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,933
Keep it deep in your lungs.

107
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,318
OK?

108
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,239
Let it go.

109
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,079
Good.

110
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,542
Don't feel anything.

111
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:06,247
Now, the thing is,
I didn't set out to be a dope deaIer.

112
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,750
It's not something I'm proud of.

113
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:14,547
But a deaIer is reaIIy just someone
who buys more dope than he can smoke,

114
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:19,386
and I have to say I'm ashamed,
I tried to smoke it aII.

115
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:23,223
There was just too fucking much of it.

116
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,393
(Record player: thunderous rock music)

117
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,517
- Hold it in. Hold it in.
- That's good.

118
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:41,843
See, I've heard
that hash makes you sex mad.

119
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:44,721
Well, that's one thing they're right about.

120
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:50,935
Hey, Howard, you barbarian!

121
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,189
- That's my girlfriend.
- Sorry, Mac.

122
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,399
Give me a kiss.

123
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:30,725
Smoking kif gets a bit pathetic.

124
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,979
Not when you've got some opium.

125
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,859
It's the great absolver.

126
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:44,447
- Is that LSD?
- The power...

127
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:49,494
The voltage of the city
running through your mind. Try it.

128
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,621
Here we go.

129
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:55,834
- Do you chew it or suck it?
- Suck it.

130
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,378
All right. I'm sucking.

131
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:07,720
- I can't feel a fucking thing.
- Give your head a rub, man.

132
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,349
Get it clean into your brain.

133
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:19,357
(Crescendo of rushing)

134
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,825
Oh, fucking hell!

135
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,453
It's fucking mental!

136
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:42,380
(Shrieking)
HeIp me! Somebody heIp me!

137
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,926
(Distorted voices wail and scream)

138
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,679
HeIp me, somebody!

139
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,686
(Soft weeping)

140
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,403
Argh!

141
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,834
Oh, fuck!

142
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,091
All right!
I fucking can't even harm my foot!

143
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:30,219
My fucking foot!
Ow, my fucking foot!

144
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,013
My fucking foot!

145
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:44,901
The Dean got the charges dropped
as aII they couId find on me was a roach.

146
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:48,821
But l was warned,
knuckIe down and study.

147
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:54,077
So I stopped smoking marijuana,
read as much as I couId,

148
00:15:55,621 --> 00:16:00,917
and graduated from Oxford University
with a second-class degree.

149
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,177
AIthough we reveIIed
in each other's company,

150
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:16,349
I have no idea why IIze and I
took the extraordinariIy impracticaI step

151
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,476
of getting married.

152
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,687
We moved to London.

153
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:27,110
We had no money, and our prospects
were as two poorly paid teachers.

154
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:30,613
We must set a good example.

155
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:36,869
Long hair and colourful clothes do not.

156
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,039
I think a three-piece suit should be worn
under the gown...

157
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:45,503
I had gone straight just when
the rest of the country had started to swing.

158
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:50,133
- I've put acid in the punch, so...
- Oh fuck, I've got to be careful.

159
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,467
You know?

160
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,137
We're not smoking weed.

161
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,513
- How long?
- Six months.

162
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:58,266
- Six fucking months?
- I'm teaching now. I can't smoke.

163
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:01,519
- Did you start freaking out, or...
- No. No, no.

164
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:04,480
- You see the world the way it is.
- Don't blame it all on the world.

165
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,775
I'm not. That's your idea,
to stop smoking. All right?

166
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:11,988
- Isn't it great?
- At times like this, I could murder a joint.

167
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:15,033
- You should have some.
- No, come on! Stop!

168
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,702
- All right, OK!
- (Howard) Oh, no, it's... Listen...

169
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:21,122
- This is not fair.
- I feel good, I feel good.

170
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,082
How do you afford a place like this,
Graham?

171
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,544
I'm shifting 50 pounds of the finest
Pakistani black every fucking month.

172
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,963
- Fucking hell.
- Fucking hell!

173
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,051
- Lot of money.
- Lot of money.

174
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:36,262
Well done. Is it... You know...
It's got to be risky, isn't it?

175
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,930
If you get stopped, you're fucked.

176
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:41,059
I've never been stopped.
I've done it hundreds of times.

177
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,852
So you put it in the panels, do you?

178
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,730
The side panels.
We take the fucking car apart

179
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,774
and we stuff it everywhere we can get it.

180
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,901
Fucking hell, man.

181
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:53,446
- But you know what, it pays for all this.
- I know, man! Jesus!

182
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,783
- Yeah, man. Fucking hell.
- Beautiful.

183
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:03,498
- Graham? Gonna have a look upstairs.
- Yeah, yeah, whatever.

184
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,918
(Howard) All right?

185
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,311
- What's that?
- Go.

186
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:29,774
- Sorry.
- No, stay.

187
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,194
Go, an ancient Japanese game.
Wanna play?

188
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,405
- Yeah.
- Here, roll me a joint.

189
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:40,493
We take it in turns placing stones
on the board. Black goes first.

190
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,746
Right. Erm... I put it anywhere, right?

191
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:46,040
- As long as it's on an intersection.
- OK.

192
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,086
There.

193
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,673
Now, I play here.

194
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:59,887
- Er... No, thanks.
- It's a great game to play stoned.

195
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:04,225
- I had to give it up.
- Why?

196
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,435
I'm a teacher.

197
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,022
And what about sex?

198
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,528
I'm married.

199
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,908
You see, in the game of Go,

200
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:23,619
when a stone has no free space next to it,

201
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:26,372
it is captured and taken off the board.

202
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,588
Bit like life, really.

203
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,219
You don't look like a teacher.

204
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,639
What do I look like, then?

205
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,351
Like a drug smuggler.

206
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,189
Hmm.

207
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,994
(Phone rings)

208
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,963
- Hello.
- IIze, it's Mandy. Is Howard there, pIease?

209
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:20,760
Uh... Mandy. Uhh...
He...He's sleeping.

210
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,846
Graham's disappeared, OK?
I think he's been busted.

211
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,641
Mandy? It's Howard.

212
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,393
- Where is he?
- In Germany. Can you go there?

213
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,937
I can't. I mean...

214
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,439
You're the only straight person
Graham knows. Please.

215
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:37,401
I've never been out of the country...
I haven't got a passport.

216
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,862
Look, I...I'll call you back, all right?

217
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:52,375
- I can't go.
- Howard...

218
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,585
(Whispers) What?

219
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:58,256
I've fallen in love with someone else.

220
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:04,303
(Speaks German)

221
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,641
Thank you.

222
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,353
Bitte.

223
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:16,148
I was just crossing the Swiss-German
border, like I'd done a hundred times before.

224
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,901
You know,
they always just waved me through.

225
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:22,363
This time, the German Nazis fucking
pulled me over and took the car apart.

226
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:25,283
Found 100 pounds of Lebanese black
in the back seat and the panels.

227
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:28,828
- Probablyjust wanted to smoke it.
- What else would they fucking do with it?

228
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:33,207
And we've got a second batch
in a warehouse in Wiesbaden.

229
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:36,085
It's in a Mercedes. Keys in the station.

230
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,045
I've never driven
on the wrong side of the road.

231
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:41,716
That's why you're perfect for it. You'll
sail through, they don't know your face.

232
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,302
Look, I've done it too many fucking times.

233
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:48,306
Now, you get it back to London
and you make a ton of money.

234
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,225
How much?

235
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,110
Every time I crossed the border,

236
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:28,906
l'd get a religious flash
and an asexuaI orgasm.

237
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,396
Passeport.

238
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:02,606
C'est bon, merci.

239
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,003
(Hushed) Judy.

240
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,300
(Hushed) Judy!

241
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:17,473
(Whispered) Oh, shit!

242
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:19,850
Sorry.

243
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,644
Sorry, sorry. Sorry.

244
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,188
Come down.

245
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:26,232
- It's the middle of the night.
- What?

246
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:29,026
- It's the middle of the night.
- I know. Bring some fags.

247
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:32,363
- I have a friend over.
- Come on, please, Judy.

248
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:34,240
I got something amazing to show you.

249
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,952
OK...

250
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:41,497
- (Gasps)
- Trouble is, I need somewhere to stash it.

251
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:43,123
Right.

252
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,834
Get the bags out.
Keep an eye out, yeah, for people?

253
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:50,005
I got it.

254
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:55,094
He's up there, is he? Don't suppose
he'd mind if I stayed the night, would he?

255
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:08,983
Am I a criminal now?

256
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:14,780
When you break a law that's wrong,
that can't be a crime.

257
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,783
Not in the moral sense.

258
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,577
Why is it against the law?

259
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:24,582
Why make something illegal that expands
your consciousness, makes you think?

260
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:27,626
Makes you wanna fuck.

261
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:38,929
What the fuck...

262
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:50,357

You must be...Mr Durrani?

271
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:32,399
Take a step forward.
Hands to the side.

272
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,450
- Howard what?
- Marks. Howard Marks.

273
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:43,661
Stay there. One second.

274
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:48,415
Chap here says, er, he's Howard Marks.

275
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:50,626
Bring him in.

276
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,796
- Come in.
- Thank you.

277
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:56,131
My Name's Malik. This is Mr Durrani.

278
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:58,759
- Mr Durrani. Hello.
- Good afternoon.

279
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:01,136
- Mohammed Durrani.
- Nice to meet you.

280
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:03,514
- Take a seat.
- Thank you.

281
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,391
Would you like a drink?

282
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,769
Yes, please. I'll have a... I'll have a whisky.
Thank you.

- Cheers.
- Cheers.

284
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,652
You saw Plinston?

285
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,779
I did. I...I...

286
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:22,533
So, I got a call from him and
I drove out to see him in Germany. Erm...

287
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,785
- Did he talk?
- No, he won't squeal.

288
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:32,584
So he very kindly asked me to run
a little errand on your behalf. And, erm...

289
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,920
I think you'll be pleased.

290
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:45,305
- Very impressive!
- (They chuckle)

291
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:48,434
Ah, well, I can see
you've been, er, very efficient.

292
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:53,647
Well, I wish I had more to sell, you know.
I got rid of it all in a day, so...yeah.

293
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:57,776
- How much do you charge per pound?
- 40 quid.

294
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,779
Forty?

295
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:05,659
- That's very good. Have you counted it?
- Yeah, it's all there, boys. It's all there.

296
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:07,453
How much is it?

297
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:11,081
In the papers
they call people who sell drugs pushers,

298
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:14,209
like you've got to try really hard
to get rid of it.

299
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:17,254
- Doesn't really work like that, does it?
- No, it doesn't.

300
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,006
- Well...
- I tell you, Howard,

301
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:24,011
I can get any amount of merchandise
up into the air from Karachi Airport.

302
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:27,055
The problem
is how to get it onto the ground.

303
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,223
(Marks) Uh-huh.

304
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:32,519
James McCann,
the people's hero from the Provisional IRA,

305
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:36,106
in their struggle
against the British government.

306
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:39,318
They've arrested him
and charged him with terrorism.

307
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,404
He wouldn't recognise court,
turned his back on the proceedings.

308
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,531
Crazy cat!

309
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:46,408
They've thrown him in jail,

310
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:48,660
he's escaped, sawed through the bars.

311
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:52,498
The nutter's got every policeman in Ireland
looking for him.

312
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,583
Then out of the blue,
he comes into the office,

313
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:56,919
gives us an interview for the magazine.

314
00:29:57,045 --> 00:30:00,214
Yeah, he's a...
He's a real revolutionary.

315
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:03,091
- Welcome to paradise.
- Paradise?

316
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,389
(Knocking) Jim?

317
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,435
Jim?

318
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,980
- Where's your man McCann?
- Hello?

319
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:21,151
Likes his porn.

320
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:24,404
Hey, your mam's in here.

321
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:27,282
- Let's have a look.
- Doesn't she look like your mum?

322
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,159
Shut up.

323
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:34,206
Hashish should be illegal.
Gives us a means of living.

324
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:37,125
A new currency to overthrow
the fascist overlords.

325
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,919
I don't think it should be illegal.

326
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:42,297
I can't condone
the punishing of people who smoke it.

327
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:45,759
- Oh. Hello.
- Hello, Jim.

328
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,264
Uh... Howard.

329
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:58,939
- You're from Kabul, are you?
- I'm Welsh, actually.

330
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:02,901
Welsh? Fucking Welsh!
What the fuck can you do?

331
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:07,030
Well, I'm here to decide
whether you can help us or not.

332
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:13,287
Help you? I'm the Kid. The Fox!
I decide if you're any fucking use to me.

333
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,080
And you'd better be some fucking use!

334
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,457
You were followed from the airport
by my boys.

335
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,918
This place is surrounded by the IRA.

336
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:22,754
Any fucking around
and you're gone, brother, gone!

337
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,965
Right?

338
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,761
Alan, why have you brought me this wimp?

339
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,848
You was gonna get me someone
who could bring me arms from Kabul.

340
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:35,559
I told you,
Kabul's not a place that sells arms.

341
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:40,397
What the fuck do you mean, sell arms?
I don't buy fucking arms.

342
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:42,733
I get given them by people
who want to ensure their future

343
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:46,320
when we finally kick you fucking Brits
out of my country!

344
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,530
Sell arms...

345
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:53,577
Smoke, Jim?

346
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:59,666
We're dope smugglers. We wanted to know
if you could help us bring it into the country.

347
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:01,460
Pay you a lot of money for doing it.

348
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,794
OK.

349
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,923
Did nobody tell you
what the boys do to drug dealers?

350
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:10,260
We're revolutionaries,
not fucking drug pushers.

351
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,305
Out!

352
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,432
- Walk! Now! You, come on.
- OK.

353
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,184
- Out!
- All right, Jim. All right.

354
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,394
Come on!

355
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:27,194
Down there. Come on!

356
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:32,616
We've done nothing wrong.

357
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:40,666
- Jim, please!
- Hey, hey! What the fuck are you doing?

358
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:44,795
- Joint? Last request?
- You're not fucking listening, are ya?

359
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,381
We don't want that filth here.

360
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,426
Stand back.
I'm gonna kneecap Soppy Bollocks.

361
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:54,554
No. No, no, man, listen. I'll go first.
He's shitting himself.

362
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:57,015
- Do me.
- Good man.

363
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:00,477
You might wanna sit down first,
so you don't crack your head when you fall.

364
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:02,729
- Take your trousers down.
- What?

365
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:04,147
It's for your own good.

366
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:07,693
If I shoot you through the trousers, a bit of
cloth could get in the wound and infect it

367
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,362
and you'd have to lose the leg.
Come on.

368
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,491
All right.

369
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:22,457
- That's very gracious of you.
- Will you be wanting that smoke now?

370
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,547
Yeah.

371
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:32,718
What's a Welsh prat like you doing
selling hash, anyway?

372
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:36,304
You should've stuck to painting road signs.

373
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:42,019
Give me that fucking joint.

374
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:55,365
He's not getting a fucking penny.
That's my first condition.

375
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:59,703
Condition number two. I want £500 cash
now for setting everything up

376
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:03,206
and £5,000 for doing it. OK?

377
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,835
All right.

378
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,466
(Howard) He was joking you.

379
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,815
The Provos can't be involved
in any of this shite.

380
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:32,444
If they find out, I'll be shot.

381
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:37,824
You'll be shot,
we'll all be fucking shot.

382
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,035
So, we don't sell the stuff in Ireland.

383
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:42,913
You'd better not be selling anything here.

384
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,542
Could you get us some filthy films?

385
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:55,300
Condoms? Priests have made them illegal.
They wanna charge us a kid a fuck.

386
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:11,525
It's a fucking emergency.
I'm picking up my boss's luggage.

387
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:14,152
That'll be grand. I'll keep my eye on it.

388
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:16,780
See, Howard, I fucking own this place.

389
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,909
Hey, watch yourself there.

390
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:24,121
You see your man there?
That's Eamonn.

391
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,039
- Right.
- He examines all the papers.

392
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:29,751
Now, if he values his Guinness,
he'll pass the fucking lot.

393
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,837
He thinks you're bringing in guns
for the cause,

394
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,714
so make sure those cases
fucking rattle, OK?

395
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:38,385
You see what I mean, Howard?
This place is wide open.

396
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,929
How's about you, big man?
Keeping busy?

397
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:43,056
- This is Howard.
- Nice to meet you.

398
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:44,766
See you later, OK?
Right, this way.

399
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:48,186
It's a brilliant plan, Jim.
When can we start?

400
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:52,274
Fucking now. We've got it all together.
Bring in as much as you want.

401
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:56,528
How soon can you send the nordle?

402
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,196
What the fuck's nordle?

403
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:03,577
Wise up. You have to use codes,
codes and false names. Nordle is hashish.

404
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:05,453
- Nordle?
- OK?

405
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:10,375
- Right.
- Listen, a word of advice, Howard.

406
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,669
When you come back, don't fly here.
Fly somewhere else.

407
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:16,047
Do the last bit by train or bus or car,
whatever.

408
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:19,885
- Gus, this is Howard.
- Y'all right, Howard?

409
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,888
- Hello, Gus.
- Howard.

410
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:30,770
That was Gus. He's a member of
the Belfast Brigade's assassination squad.

411
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:35,442
I wanted him to know your face, so no
fucking games now, you understand me?

412
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:41,823
So you really think I can pass for a native?

413
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:45,952
DH Marks, this is the perfect look for you.

414
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:49,331
Remember, many Afridi
have blonde hair and blue eyes.

415
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,709
Just look stoned and say nothing.

416
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:55,045
What if they don't buy it?

417
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:58,089
Then they'll probably rob you and kill you.

418
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:24,199
(Men shout to one another)

419
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,213
Ibrahim!

420
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:52,143
As-salaam alaikum.

421
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,404
When you're making hash, this is your loot.

422
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,198
It's in three different goatskins.
Black, white, brown.

423
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:07,117
Three different qualities.

424
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,868
- See these herbs?
- Uh-huh.

425
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:11,204
When the flower comes up first,
you cut off the top,

426
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:14,207
chop it up
and put that into the white goatskin.

427
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,376
Then when the second flower
comes through,

428
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:18,378
you chop that up,
put those in the brown bags.

429
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:21,298
This is what you call medium quality,
but we use a lot. You see?

430
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:24,092
- Oh, man!
- That's not the top quality.

431
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:28,096
The top stuff we put in the white bag,
and we only use a little bit of it.

432
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:32,726
Then this third flower that comes through,
you chop it up, put those into black bags.

433
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,978
This is the one we use the most of.

434
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:38,148
Be careful, because when we make hash
we have to mix up the three,

435
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:40,191
because if you only use the top quality,

436
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,402
you blow your head off.

437
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:03,590
ShouId I say it's fantastic
or say it's not bad,

438
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:06,718
say it's worth every penny
or say it's cameI shit

439
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,970
and they'd better come up
with something better?

440
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:11,890
I need to roll a joint.

441
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:15,310
It's what I'm used to, see?
It's the, er...

442
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:18,772
It's the only way
I can make a fair assessment.

443
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:47,926
- Mr Marks?
- That's right.

444
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,762
- Patrick Lane, Judy's brother.
- Nice to meet you.

445
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,972
I'm the square one of the family.

446
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,141
Shall we?

447
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:59,771
So, erm... I wanna open a business,
a shop, in Oxford.

448
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:03,358
And, erm...
Well, I don't know quite how to go about it.

449
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:06,861
Well, yes. I'm a chartered accountant.

450
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:09,948
Um... How much do you have
to invest in the business?

451
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,616
- A lot.
- Five thousand?

452
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:15,078
- A lot. A lot.
- You don't really need more than five...

453
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:19,207
I need someone to help me understand
how to put a lot of money in...

454
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,418
- And how to take it out.
- Yeah.

455
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:26,548
- You need to explain this big lot of money.
- Yeah.

456
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:30,218
Sounds like you need a bent accountant.

457
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:35,140
(Man) Everyone smile.

458
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,225
I declare this shop open.

459
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:40,979
Anna and BeIinda
had no idea what I was up to.

460
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:44,691
The shop became a successful
IittIe dress emporium in its own right.

461
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:46,901
- (Patrick) Cheers.
- (All) Cheers!

462
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:51,239
It was now that my story
took a bizarre twist.

463
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:56,202
Quite out of the bIue, my oId friend Mac
waIked into my shop.

464
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:57,245
Mac, man!

465
00:40:57,371 --> 00:41:01,541
Cheers.
She's had to take a clerical job in a bank,

466
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:04,544
which she finds monumentally tedious.

467
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,754
You could do with a bit of money, then?

468
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,340
Well, we're OK.

469
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:13,678
It's just that I'll probably get
a foreign posting again, so it's...

470
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:16,139
not really worth
putting down roots right now.

471
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:18,516
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

472
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,935
Are you sure?
You know, erm....

473
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,980
do a bit of work for me?

474
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:28,193
- What?
- Well, you know, a bit of driving.

475
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:34,824
- Two thousand pounds.
- Howard, don't be naughty.

476
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,576
I work for the government.

477
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:39,829
They don't really approve
of that sort of thing.

478
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:44,083
Are you selling drugs, Howard?

479
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,422
- Who? Me?
- Well, you seem to be doing very well.

480
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:52,133
- Look, it's the shop, man.
- (Laughs)

481
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:53,927
It is. It's really taken off.

482
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:56,763
I'm opening branches
in Dublin, Amsterdam.

483
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,973
Still the same old Howard.

484
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:02,894
How about the ladies?
Still having the old success?

485
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,063
Look, I'm with Judy now.
She's pregnant.

486
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:08,733
- But that wouldn't inhibit you, would it?
- What, chatting up other women?

487
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,568
Not for narcissistic pleasure.

488
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:15,532
What the fuck for, then, Mac?

489
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,118
For Queen and country.

490
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:24,832
Are you...
asking me to be a spy?

491
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:29,629
Howard, I haven't just turned up on
your doorstep without doing my research.

492
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:32,131
Will you help us?

493
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,217
How can I help you?

494
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:36,135
We need people to...

495
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,263
gather information for us.

496
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:39,681
Bloody hell, you are!

497
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,891
- You're a fucking spy!
- Howard, keep it down.

498
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:44,352
This is not a James Bond movie.

499
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:46,479
Well, it certainly feels like it.

500
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:50,942
You're recruiting me.
You're asking me to be a member of MI6.

501
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:54,112
The Government doesn't ever
officially acknowledge the existence

502
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:56,864
of what you call MI6.

503
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:59,867
However, we do need
to keep abreast of things,

504
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:04,581
and we do employ a loose network
of people who do things for us.

505
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:11,170
You travel in circles we can't penetrate,
which is why I need your help.

506
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,839
Sort of a...

507
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:15,425
patriotic thing, old chap.

508
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:22,557
And I imagine this would give me...

509
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:27,604
you know, a certain amount of...protection.

510
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:32,358
We can't possibly condone any
criminal activity or grant immunity.

511
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:35,111
However, if you're ever in trouble...

512
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:36,988
call this number.

513
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:45,204
I'm fat and ugly.

514
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:49,042
I hate it here. I want to go to Ibiza.

515
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:52,420
I love it when you're brown.

516
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:57,717
- So we'll go?
- Yeah, Judy, look, I've gotta go to Ireland.

517
00:43:57,843 --> 00:44:01,596
Bullshit. Dealing's supposed to support us,
not become your life.

518
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:04,307
Judy, I hate it, too. You know I hate it.

519
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:06,517
Come to Ibiza with me, Howie.

520
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:10,480
- (Alarm clock rings)
- Oh, shit.

521
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:15,401
OK, love, I've gotta go. OK?

522
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,863
- I love you.
- Come straight back.

523
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,074
I promise.

524
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,205
Love you.

525
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,837
Aw, fuck.

526
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,103
(Women talk animatedly)

527
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:51,729
- You gonna be long?
- Fuck off.

528
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,940
All right!

529
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:57,819
Do you mind if I jump the queue?
It's an emergency.

530
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:00,029
There's a queue!

531
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:03,324
(Woman)
I changed my plans and everythin'!

532
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:07,954
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!
Fuck! Fuck!

533
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,752
(DiaI tone)

534
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:18,715
- Operator.
- Can you connect me to Ballinskelligs 1?

535
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:20,466
Irish Republic.

536
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:22,593
PIease insert 50 pence.

538
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:26,264
- Come on.
- (Beeping)

539
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,474
Come on.

540
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:34,313

541
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,483
(Phone rings)

542
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:52,457
Hello. Ballinskelligs 1 .
Who would you be wanting?

543
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:58,129
MichaeI Murphy's, the shop, the farm,
or the strangers that arrived Iast night?

544
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:02,300
Ahh... I... I.... I...
Th-Th-The strangers.

545
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:05,219
Well, do you know,
I don't think they're at home,

546
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:07,430
so I'll put you through to the pub.

547
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,684
(Phone rings)

548
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,818
- Hello?
- Hello.

549
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:23,780
- Is Jim McCann there?
- Who wants to know?

550
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:27,450
Mr McCarthy. The nordle man.

551
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:29,577
- What?
- Nordle!

552
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,245
What the fuck is nordle?

553
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:36,167
Jim, do you know anything
about some fucker called Nordle?

554
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:42,507
Fucking eejit!

555
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:45,009
Are you trying to blow my cover, eh?

556
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:49,263
What the fuck are you doing?
And why don't you ever answer the phone?

557
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:51,349
I'm sorry, right? It was vandalised.

558
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:55,269
Why hasn't Plinston sent the nordle? I've got
things to do. I'm fighting a fucking war.

559
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:59,524
It's coming in tomorrow
on the Frankfurt flight.

560
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,651
Make sure it gets there before 5pm.

561
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:05,404
It has to be on the first
Aer Lingus flight to Shannon. OK?

562
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:09,659
- I've got problems with a shift change.
- Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, that's impossible.

563
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:11,953
Just make it happen, brother!

564
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,581
Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck it!

565
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,385
Taxi!

I'm at Bernard Murphy's.
I've had an accident.

Thanks.

Please insert £5.50.

598
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:06,252
Karachi? That's in Pakistan, isn't it?

599
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:15,886
- Malik?
- The same.

600
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:18,222
- Has the nordle left?
- No.

601
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:21,809
They don't eat spaghetti.
They'd like to use chopsticks

602
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:24,520
or they'd like to eat wurst
or smorgasbord.

603
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:26,355
Is the curry house still open?

604
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:29,108
Closed due to uninvited guests.

605
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:30,860

I just can't get them to go for spaghetti.

- Shit, he's gone!

00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,754
What Malik meant was

612
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:53,549
that the shipment wouId have to come
from KabuI in Afghanistan

613
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:57,011
as Karachi in Pakistan was blocked,
due to a war.

614
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:01,849
- Jim!
- Hey, Howard, take one of these.

615
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:04,727
We're gonna do this
with military precision,

616
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:06,896
with the grace of a Mozart concerto.

617
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:09,023
When I pick up the nordle from Shannon,

618
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:12,485
I want you to wait here alone
in the farmhouse with one of these, OK?

619
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:15,988
Now, when I'm on my way
I'm going to send you a coded message,

620
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:18,407
something like, uh,
"I've got the nordle."

621
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:20,367
What's the point of that?

622
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:24,205
So you'll know precisely what time I'm
delivering the nordle, you stupid Welsh prat.

623
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:27,124
- Why do I need to know precisely?
- Do as you're fucking told.

624
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:30,878
- I've got no time for games. You know that.
- There's a war on in Pakistan...

625
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:33,672
There's a fucking war here.

626
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:37,301
Last Sunday, youse Brits
killed 13 innocent Irishmen in cold blood.

629
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:48,646
About fucking time.

630
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,398
- Let's watch one now.
- All right.

631
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:55,027
- Got a projector?
- (Exasperated sigh)

632
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:57,238

633
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:00,282
Get your fucking arse in there.

634
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:07,790
- (Crash)
- Shh!

635
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:13,504
Try this one.

636
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:17,383

Go on!

640
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:29,311

I've got a telegram for you, sir.

648
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:16,358
Howard, you're letting in the light.
Shut the fucking door.

649
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:19,737
Go on! Oh!

650
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:22,823
There's a problem.

651
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:26,827
The nordle's not going to be in Frankfurt
on time to be loaded onto our flight.

652
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:31,540
It has to, Howard. I've told you
a dozen times, Eamonn's got shift changes.

653
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:35,252
- We're gonna have to write this one off.
- Shut the fuck up.

654
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:37,463
I'm trying to watch the wee lass. Go on.

655
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:45,721
Oh! Oh, no, stop.

656
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:47,932
OK, OK, that's it. Get a beer.

657
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:55,022
OK, I'll get the fucking nordle, but I want
50 quid a pound, given the extra hassle.

658
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:57,024
- Forget it, Jim.
- Put it this way.

659
00:53:57,150 --> 00:54:01,278
You pay me 50 quid a pound or I rip off
the whole fucking lot and become a legend.

660
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:11,538
Aer Lingus.

661
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:15,793
This is your man Jim McCann
of the Provisional IRA.

662

Pull up the aerial, ya prick!

669
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,709
- Howard!
- Hello?

670
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:58,502
What are you fucking doing?!

671
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:00,504
Come here!

672
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:04,258
- Press the button.
- Jim. Jim.

673
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:08,512
- Jim!
- I've got the nordle. I've got...

674
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:11,890
- I've got...
- Come in. Jim?

675
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:13,600
- Listen...
- What are you doing?

676
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:15,602
I can hear you the other end of the field.

677
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:17,813
You fucking idiot!

678
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:21,942
- It's on, the aerial's up.
- Piece of fucking shite!

679
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:25,154
Look. It's not even on, Jim.

680
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,951
Why the fuck is my name on the boxes?

681
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:34,872
It's not. It says...
No, it's Juma Khan.

682
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:37,416
Juma means Mister or something
in the Middle East,

683
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:41,170
and Friday means...
No, Khan means Friday.

684
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:45,090
Look, Juma Khan
might mean Man Friday in Kabul,

685
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:48,844
but here in Ireland,
Jim McCann means it's fucking me, the Kid!

686
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:01,607
- OK.
- (Jim) Come on. You wee beauty.

687
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:17,081
Right.

688
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:20,125
You see, Howard,

689
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:21,835
the Kid's done it.

690
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:25,422
I've done it. The Kid has done it!

691
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:29,718
Right.

692
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:40,687
- Well?
- Hang on.

693
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:42,272
Oh, Jesus.

694
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:54,493
Come on.

695
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:57,371
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

696
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:09,216
- What do you think?
- It's...

697
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:13,387
It's shite. (Laughs)

698
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:20,436
No, no, no, no, no.
Careful, careful, careful!

699
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:23,147
Oh, shit. It's fucking explosives.

700
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:25,607
Oh, fucking hell, Jim.

701
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:27,734
What about the peace and love thing?

702
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:29,987
You only deal in nordle. Nordle is fiction.

703
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:33,031
Arms and explosives are non-fiction.
That's reality.

704
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:35,200
I deal in non-fiction,
not this fucking hippy shite.

705
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:05,314
- Pull over here, please, sir. Thank you.
- Yes.

706
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:14,072
Thank you.
Can I see your passport, please, sir?

707
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:16,825
It's not my passport. It's your passport.

708
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:19,077
So are you Dennis Howard Marks?

709
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:21,330
I am.

710
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:23,540
Will you step out of the car, please?

711
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:28,003
- Hello, boy.
- Stand over there, please, sir.

712
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:30,380
Get Major in there, in the front.

713
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,466
Round the back there. Go on.

714
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:34,718
So, what was the purpose of your visit?

715
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:37,846
Erm... Studying beneficial herbs.

716
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:42,351
- Trying to take the piss or what?
- I've a huge respect for customs officers.

717
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:44,144
Course you have.

718
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:45,604
Boys, get on with it.

719
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:11,129
Hope you're gonna
pay for the damage, boys.

720
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:46,123
Passport, sir.

721
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:55,966
I never went through Customs any more
with anything l didn't want them to find.

722
01:00:40,094 --> 01:00:42,179
Gentlemen,

723
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:47,726
this is what banking is all about.

724
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,023
Thank you. Thank you.

725
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:56,276
(Record player -

726
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:19,383
Fuck off!
You're driving me, both, fucking crazy!

727
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,551
It's supposed to be a fucking holiday.

728
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:24,763
What's the fucking problem?
I told you about her.

729
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:28,475
I told you everything about her and you said
it was fine for her to fucking come.

730
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:31,561
Come here! Fuck!
Don't fucking walk away from me.

731
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:35,524
Take the fucking sulk off your face,
you fucking wee bitch!

732
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:38,985
Get in the pool. Have some fucking fun!
Come on!

733
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:41,655
We're on holiday. Come on!

734
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:43,240
Fuck you! Howard?

735
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,242
- Morning.
- Do you have a pen?

736
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:47,285
Judy?

737
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:48,787
- (Jim) Judy?
- Yeah.

738
01:01:48,913 --> 01:01:50,831
(Howard) Morning, Jim.

739
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:54,042
Woo hoo! Hey hey!

740
01:01:54,168 --> 01:01:57,003
I'll show you what we used to do
when we were wee kids. Look at this.

741
01:01:57,130 --> 01:02:00,132
- Oh, fucking hell.
- It's great fun. Look look, look.

742
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:03,385
Look. Hang about, look.
Just a little wee eye there.

743
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:05,429
(Howard) Oh, Jim!

744
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,764
There's the wee mouth. Judy?

745
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:10,892
- (Shrieks)
- Give the wee Kid a kiss!

746
01:02:11,018 --> 01:02:14,771
- Give the wee little Fox a kiss!
- Fuck off, man.

747
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:19,609
- Ah, you wee shite!
- Wipe that smile off your cock.

748
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:21,945
I can't fucking swim, you fucking cunt!

749
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:25,824
- Fucking wanker.
- He's all right, man. He's having a laugh.

750
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:30,912
My grandfather, Patrick Murphy,
was a Catholic policeman in Belfast.

751
01:02:31,038 --> 01:02:35,083
- He was murdered by the fucking IRA.
- Well, he shouldn't have joined the police.

752
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:38,795
- He doesn't mean any harm, Patrick.
- He's a sociopathic liar.

753
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:43,884
Look, it doesn't matter if you lie all the time.
Just take it into account.

754
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:47,262
I just wish there was another way.
Listen, I've been thinking.

755
01:02:47,388 --> 01:02:51,308
We should ditch all this small-time shit
and get into the American market.

756
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:53,977
- Why?
- The numbers.

757
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:55,312
Listen to me.

758
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:59,858
Consumption of hashish and marijuana
in the UK is about three tons a day.

759
01:02:59,984 --> 01:03:04,654
In the USA, they smoke 28 tons
every day of the year.

760
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:09,117
Now, most of it is cheap Mexican weed
that sells for 200 bucks a pound.

761
01:03:09,243 --> 01:03:14,414
But good hash, like ours,
it costs one thousand bucks a pound.

762
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:16,208
- Wow!
- No.

763
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:18,585
- No. No way.
- (Jim shrieks)

764
01:03:18,711 --> 01:03:20,879
No way. No fucking way.

765
01:03:21,005 --> 01:03:22,756
- What's the difference?
- The Yanks.

766
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:26,343
- They'll come after you, Howard.
- They're not gonna come after me.

767
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:28,553
Patrick, don't encourage him.

768
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,891
It doesn't make any difference anyway.

769
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:35,560
I can't figure out
how you'd get it across the Atlantic.

770
01:03:35,686 --> 01:03:38,188
You'd need a fucking huge crate.

771
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:43,777
You see, when a band tours America
with their gear, they're not importing it.

772
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:46,154
They get this thing called a carnet.

773
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:48,657
A sum of money
that's deposited with Customs,

774
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:52,786
which is retrieved again
when the equipment leaves the country.

775
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:55,580
Customs tear the docket off the paperwork
and wave it through.

776
01:03:55,706 --> 01:03:58,667
- Do the band know?
- Who gives a fuck?

777
01:04:06,801 --> 01:04:08,134
(Woman) Hello.
(Howard) Hi.

778
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:12,264
Hello. Welcome.
Welcome to California.

779
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:14,099
- Thank you.
- You found us.

780
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:16,768
- Ernie Combs. Good to meet you.
- Howard.

Thank you.

We will, uh...
Well, we'll keep the west coast, uh, stoned.

784
01:04:27,321 --> 01:04:30,282
I was wondering
when you were gonna introduce me.

785
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:32,158
- Here we are.
- Hello, there.

786
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:34,661
- Hey.
- Nice to meet you. I'm Howard.

787
01:04:34,787 --> 01:04:36,872
Patti. It's great to meet you.

788
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:40,417
You're a very lucky man, Ernie.

789
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:43,753
Well, you know, we're, uh...
we're all lucky here.

790
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:49,551
We don't dig any of this, like,
possession jealousy vibe.

791
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:56,850
- How are you?
- I'm well. How are you?

792
01:04:58,269 --> 01:04:59,394
Hey. ¿Cómo estàs?

793
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:00,812
I'll be right back.

794
01:05:00,938 --> 01:05:03,023
Mmm. Don't be long.

795
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:10,655
- Ernie.
- Oh. Uh, Howard,

796
01:05:10,781 --> 01:05:14,242
your load should hit Vegas
at some point this evening,

797
01:05:14,368 --> 01:05:17,203
so then you can come on by
and pick up the dough, man.

798
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:22,292
I was rather hoping
I'd get the money upfront, you know?

799
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:25,211
- Right.
- So I can get going.

800
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:28,548
Yeah. Um...

801
01:05:28,674 --> 01:05:31,551
I... Look, I'm...I'm sorry, but...

802
01:05:32,553 --> 01:05:33,929
This...

803
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:36,973
I-It has to be...

804
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:40,185
You show me...

805
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:44,230
the dope...
and I show you the money.

806
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:46,358

Hey, man, I love the Floyd.

809
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:59,621

put it on the pIane to Vegas,

810
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:02,457
they fucked up and Ieft one speaker behind.

811
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:09,381
What we got here?

812
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:33,321
- Hello, guys.
- Hello.

813
01:06:33,447 --> 01:06:38,326
- What have you got?
- No prints, no suspects, nothing. Just dope.

814
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:41,705
The load was headed to Las Vegas.

815
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:45,875
Send this puppy on to Vegas.

816
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:49,254
I'll go along for the ride
and we'll see if anyone comes to pick it up.

817
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:01,975
The speaker's that case.

818
01:07:09,817 --> 01:07:11,359

819
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:18,158
Let's go and bust it.

820
01:07:28,085 --> 01:07:30,545
Well, sir, you gonna help me?

821
01:07:30,671 --> 01:07:32,797
It's all right, pig, I'm just
a dude picking up speakers.

822
01:07:32,923 --> 01:07:35,133
All right, darling?
Can I be of assistance, gentlemen?

823
01:07:35,259 --> 01:07:37,510
- Police! Get down!
- For fuck's sake!

824
01:07:37,636 --> 01:07:40,138
Get off! Get off!

01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:31,606
(Siren)

838
01:08:46,163 --> 01:08:50,083
- Would you like red or white wine?
- Oh, I'll have red, please. Thank you.

839
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:58,341
Lovely. I just went to a party last night.
Left the keys at home.

840
01:08:58,467 --> 01:09:02,679
(TV) Here, Scotland Yard detectives say
they expect to make more arrests today

841
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:04,639
on an internationaI poIice operation

842
01:09:04,765 --> 01:09:07,767
which is said to have smashed
a major drugs ring.

843
01:09:07,893 --> 01:09:12,480
ln all, 22 people have been arrested
in the United States, Britain and Spain.

844
01:09:12,606 --> 01:09:14,524
At least four of the arrests were made here.

845
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:17,193
A report from home affairs correspondent
BiII HamiIton.

846
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:20,530
Your Honour, bail is out of the question
for the defendant.

847
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:24,742
He has money stashed in foreign
bank accounts. He is likely to abscond.

848
01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:30,331
He is facing a possible 14 years under
Section 20 of the Misuse Of Drugs Act 1971 .

849
01:09:30,457 --> 01:09:34,752
Your Honour, there's something
I can't reveal in open court.

850
01:09:57,568 --> 01:10:01,446
We know you've been meeting a member
of the Provisional IRA who supplies arms.

851
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:03,198
And we know why you've been meeting him.

852
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:05,658
We'd like you to carry on meeting with him.

853
01:10:05,784 --> 01:10:11,164
We've had a lot of difficulty infiltrating
the IRA. You've done a pretty amazing job.

854
01:10:12,499 --> 01:10:15,627
This business with the Yanks.

855
01:10:15,753 --> 01:10:18,087
It's a bit too much, though, Howard.

856
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:21,090
I'm afraid they've got their knickers in a
twist.

857
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:22,759
Well, what should I do?

858
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:25,053
Well, we can try and pull a few strings

859
01:10:25,179 --> 01:10:29,140
and perhaps let them know
quite how important you are to us.

860
01:10:29,266 --> 01:10:34,062
But you will, of course, owe the office
a substantial debt of gratitude,

861
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:36,522
if you know what I mean?

862
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:38,983
When are you next going to see McCann?

863
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:43,029
- Mac.
- Hmm?

864
01:10:44,531 --> 01:10:47,659
The IRA don't know
he's been involved with dope.

865
01:10:49,536 --> 01:10:52,956
- They'll execute him if they find out.
- C'est la guerre, Howard.

866
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:58,002
PeopIe ask me... They say, "It Iooks Iike
a glamorous life, being a drug dealer."

867
01:10:58,128 --> 01:10:59,712
"lt looks like a lot of fun."

868
01:10:59,838 --> 01:11:05,426
And l reply, "Don't do it unless
you are prepared never to be a grass."

869
01:11:05,552 --> 01:11:08,096
Quid pro quo.

870
01:11:08,222 --> 01:11:11,933
However, appearing to cooperate
is another matter.

871
01:11:12,059 --> 01:11:15,144
Bail is granted for sureties totalling £50,000.

872
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:20,149
Mam and I will do what we can
to put up the bail,

873
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:22,735
whatever you did.

874
01:11:22,861 --> 01:11:24,195
But, erm...

875
01:11:24,321 --> 01:11:29,284
did you have anything to do with
hard drugs and guns?

876
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:32,870
No, Dad. Course not.

877
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:28,092
(Car pulling up)

878
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:38,436
(Knock at door)

879
01:12:41,273 --> 01:12:43,358
(Mutters indistinctly)

880
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:48,446
- Who is it, Mam?
- I don't know. Can I help you?

881
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:54,035
(Irish accent)
I think you better come with us.

882
01:12:54,161 --> 01:12:56,996
- Tell Judy I'll be back, OK?
- Where are you going?

883
01:12:57,122 --> 01:12:58,915
- Where are you going?
- I've gotta go.

884
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:02,460
- What about your coat, love?
- Who's this bloke?

885
01:13:02,586 --> 01:13:06,005
- How long will you be, Howard?
- I've gotta go, Mam.

886
01:13:07,007 --> 01:13:11,052
l'd staged my own abduction
so my dad wouIdn't forfeit the baiI.

887
01:13:11,178 --> 01:13:14,305
You don't forfeit bail
if you've been kidnapped.

888
01:13:14,431 --> 01:13:17,934
I'm Chief Superintendent Fairweather
from CID

889
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:20,728
and I'm looking for Howard Marks.

890
01:13:21,355 --> 01:13:24,649
- This is the room.
- Ah. Thank you.

891
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:30,405
Please, no. No, don't touch that.
That is my son's private writing.

892
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:33,950
The person who came to the door,
the way you've described him,

893
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:37,161
it sounds very much to me like, erm,

894
01:13:37,287 --> 01:13:39,705
an image that we've seen on the television.

895
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:43,042
- Is it?
- Balaclava, you know. Yes. The IRA.

896
01:13:44,711 --> 01:13:50,716
So now Eddie Laxton, intrepid reporter
for the Daily Mirror, is onto the story.

897
01:13:50,843 --> 01:13:54,095
What I don't want you to do is,
I don't want you to sensationalise it.

898
01:13:54,221 --> 01:13:57,598
- No, no, no, no, no.
- We're talking about our son here.

899
01:13:57,724 --> 01:14:01,727
- We're talking about our son, you know.
- Your son's more like a Robin Hood.

900
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:04,313
Read all about it! IRA abduction!

901
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:08,151
The next morning, I woke up famous.

902
01:14:09,611 --> 01:14:11,571
Hello, mate.

903
01:14:14,324 --> 01:14:17,869
I was now being pursued
by the IRA, the DEA,

904
01:14:17,995 --> 01:14:20,538
Customs and Excise, the police

905
01:14:20,664 --> 01:14:22,790
and the press.

906
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:32,717
(McCann on TV) This is a British
bIack propaganda exercise.

907
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:37,638
I admit I've been running guns to the North,
but l've never touched dope.

908
01:14:37,764 --> 01:14:39,849
l don't approve of it.

909
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:43,936
Oi, it's you! That's you!

910
01:14:44,062 --> 01:14:46,647
Oi, oi, it's Howard Marks. He's here.

911
01:14:46,773 --> 01:14:49,025
He's here. This is him.

912
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:51,527
- It's the man!
- (Cheering)

913
01:14:51,653 --> 01:14:54,071
- The man!
- Cheers, everyone.

914
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:55,781
Yes!

915
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:58,201
- Thank you.
- Cheers, mate.

916
01:14:58,327 --> 01:15:01,120
- Cheers, mate.
- Shh, now, right?

917
01:15:01,246 --> 01:15:05,041
Don't tell anyone I'm here.
I'm on the run, see.

918
01:15:25,062 --> 01:15:27,146
(Gasps)

919
01:15:29,858 --> 01:15:34,278
Mmm, I love you so much.

920
01:15:34,404 --> 01:15:35,821
I love you.

921
01:15:36,907 --> 01:15:38,991
I love you so, so much.

922
01:15:40,911 --> 01:15:42,245
I love my girls.

923
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:48,584
Oh, baby. Oh, baby. For ever!

924
01:15:50,045 --> 01:15:52,129
For ever.

925
01:15:56,301 --> 01:16:02,139
We got a beaten-up oId camper van
and our Iife became a perpetuaI hoIiday,

926
01:16:04,017 --> 01:16:07,979
though Judy often compIained that we had
to park too near the camp site's toilets,

927
01:16:08,105 --> 01:16:11,607
because the teIephone box
was invariabIy in the vicinity.

928
01:16:15,779 --> 01:16:18,197
Howard? (Chuckles)

929
01:16:18,323 --> 01:16:23,286
Y-Yes, I am...I am relieved
to hear from you now.

930
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:27,665
And I can get the goods in from anywhere,

931
01:16:27,791 --> 01:16:30,835
provided that it's smell-proof,

932
01:16:30,961 --> 01:16:34,338
and, uh...

933
01:16:34,464 --> 01:16:37,633
on that particular Italian airline.

934
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:41,304
So can you do it?

935
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:44,682
- I need to be paid, DH Marks.
- I've only got a hundred quid, Malik.

936
01:16:45,517 --> 01:16:48,769
- That's nowhere near enough.
- A hundred quid is all I've got right now.

937
01:16:48,895 --> 01:16:50,938
But there'll be more, Malik. Much more.

938
01:16:51,064 --> 01:16:54,400
We're gonna be rich, Malik, all right?
I promise you.

939
01:16:54,526 --> 01:16:58,321
Look, we're spending now,
but the more you spend, the more you get.

940
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:01,282
You see, if you wanna keep
the rivers of money flowing,

941
01:17:01,408 --> 01:17:06,704
you've got to encourage it to, you know,
froth and bubble and ebb...

942
01:17:06,830 --> 01:17:09,582
What shit are you talking, DH Marks?
Get me the money.

943
01:17:16,923 --> 01:17:19,133
Ever had your tarot read?

944
01:17:19,259 --> 01:17:21,344
- No.
- Sit down.

945
01:17:27,434 --> 01:17:29,644
What's your date of birth?

946
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:34,732
- Fifth of September, 1947.
- And where were you born?

947
01:17:34,858 --> 01:17:37,652
- Norwich.
- I see a woman.

948
01:17:37,778 --> 01:17:42,657
- That must be Mother.
- Yes.

949
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:45,868
- Is she called Margaret?
- No. Anne.

950
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:48,746
Hmm. Well, before she was married,
was her maiden name...

951
01:17:48,872 --> 01:17:51,082
Brown. Her maiden name was Brown.

952
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:57,213
With this information, I couId appIy for
a provisionaI driving Iicence, join a Iibrary.

953
01:17:57,339 --> 01:18:00,508
Do you travel much? Ever been abroad?

954
01:18:00,634 --> 01:18:03,594
No. I don't trust foreign beer.

955
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:07,181
I couId even get a British passport
from the post office.

956
01:18:07,307 --> 01:18:10,768
I'm sorry. I can't see you.

957
01:18:10,894 --> 01:18:14,605
Will it help if I tell you my name?
I-It's Donald.

958
01:18:14,731 --> 01:18:17,024
My name's Donald Nice.

959
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:21,195
N-I-C-E, like the place in France.
On the Riviera?

960
01:18:21,321 --> 01:18:24,240
lt was up to Donald
how he pronounced his name,

961
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:27,326
but l was about to become...

962
01:18:27,452 --> 01:18:28,953
Mr Nice.

963
01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:35,418
Three days Iater, 500 kiIos of Afghan bIack,
some of the best hashish in the world,

964
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:40,923
was flown from Kabul,
via Frankfurt and Shannon, to New York.

965
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:44,802
It was being smoked in Greenwich ViIIage
the next day.

966
01:18:44,928 --> 01:18:47,263
I was very rich.

967
01:18:47,389 --> 01:18:49,473

Apart from the preoccupation
with faIse identity,

984
01:20:25,695 --> 01:20:30,074
there was IittIe to indicate I was
Britain's most wanted fugitive from justice.

985
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:33,327
I was very popuIar and had a Iot of friends.

986
01:20:33,453 --> 01:20:38,666
They knew who I was and I was aware
that any one couId turn me in at any time.

987
01:20:38,792 --> 01:20:43,212
l just bigheadedly assumed
that anyone who knew me Iiked me,

988
01:20:43,338 --> 01:20:44,839

What's it about, then, the film?

993
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:57,893
It's about a wee lad
who falls in love with a horse.

994
01:20:58,019 --> 01:21:01,939
Gets a little boner for a fucking pony, eh?

Howard. I can't talk to you.
We cannot liaise with criminals.

1040
01:25:31,668 --> 01:25:33,544
Dope smuggling is hardly a crime.

1041
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:35,754
Of course it is. Don't talk rot. It's illegal.

1042
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:39,508
I thought we agreed hashish
shouldn't be illegal. It's the law that's wrong.

1043

Goodbye.

1044
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:07,828
With your leave, my Lord,
I'd like to call the defendant.

1045
01:26:10,373 --> 01:26:13,417
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth?

1046
01:26:13,543 --> 01:26:15,544
I do.

1047
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:20,757
I'd like to ask you, if I may, to explain
to the court your involvement with MI6.

1048
01:26:20,884 --> 01:26:24,803
In 1972, I was recruited by MI6

1049
01:26:24,929 --> 01:26:28,974
to catch IRA arms smuggler
James McCann,

1050
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:32,019
by sucking him into dope deals.

1051
01:26:32,145 --> 01:26:36,273
I was doing rather well
until Her Majesty's Customs and Excise

1052
01:26:36,399 --> 01:26:39,526
messed up the secret service's plans
by arresting me.

1053
01:26:39,652 --> 01:26:44,198
Bail was arranged. I skipped, as arranged.

1054
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:47,618
The media, however,
had procured confidential information

1055
01:26:47,744 --> 01:26:51,622
that I was an MI6 agent,
and my cover was blown.

1056
01:26:52,624 --> 01:26:55,751
And knowing no other life than that of a spy,

1057
01:26:55,877 --> 01:27:00,255
I was instructed by MI6
to work for the Mexican secret services,

1058
01:27:00,381 --> 01:27:06,053
who, strangely enough, were also interested
in James McCann, due to their belief

1059
01:27:06,179 --> 01:27:10,515
that he was aiding Mexican terrorist group
September 23rd League

1060
01:27:10,642 --> 01:27:15,312
in arms acquisition,
fundraising through dope deals.

1061
01:27:17,148 --> 01:27:20,525
And in order to fulfil my dangerous mission,

1062
01:27:21,694 --> 01:27:24,154
I involved myself in dope deals.

1063
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:30,786
Mr Marks, you are using
a little bit of the truth and then glossing it.

1064
01:27:30,912 --> 01:27:36,166
It is conceded
that Marks was recruited by MI6

1065
01:27:36,292 --> 01:27:38,460
for three months in 1973,

1066
01:27:38,586 --> 01:27:42,589
by someone who was indiscreet enough
to ask for his assistance.

1067
01:27:42,715 --> 01:27:46,343
But the rest is a myth,

1068
01:27:46,469 --> 01:27:49,263
mounted by him as a smokescreen,

1069
01:27:49,389 --> 01:27:54,935
while he was indulging
in very high-level drug trafficking.

1070
01:27:55,061 --> 01:28:01,275
Let me challenge you to produce
this member of the Mexican secret services,

1071
01:28:01,401 --> 01:28:03,402
who you say recruited you.

1072
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:21,628
- Is what is written on this paper your name?
- Yes, your Honour.

1073
01:28:21,754 --> 01:28:26,633
My Lord, should the jury
not see that document?

1074
01:28:26,759 --> 01:28:28,510
He would rather they did not.

1075
01:28:28,636 --> 01:28:34,433
So what opportunity will you give me
to check on your credentials?

1076
01:28:34,559 --> 01:28:37,144
None, your Honour.
It's a matter of national security.

1077
01:28:37,270 --> 01:28:44,026
Your Lordship will recognise that matters
of quite clearly spurious national security

1078
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:47,696
cannot be permitted to intervene
on the prosecution's case.

1079
01:28:47,822 --> 01:28:52,200
My Lord, the defendant was challenged
to produce this witness and he has done so.

1080
01:28:53,536 --> 01:28:59,458
- Did you try to recruit this man here?
- Yes, I did.

1081
01:28:59,584 --> 01:29:05,088
I gave him $150,000.
I can't tell you why, your Honour.

1082
01:29:05,214 --> 01:29:07,299
It's a matter of national security.

1083
01:29:08,384 --> 01:29:12,804
What nobody knew was
that the Mexican was, in fact, a real cop

1084
01:29:12,930 --> 01:29:14,890
who was a buddy of Ernie Combs.

1085
01:29:15,016 --> 01:29:18,769
This was committing perjury
on a grand scaIe.

1086
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:22,356
Was anyone reaIIy gonna buy aII this?

1087
01:29:35,912 --> 01:29:37,496
(Sighs)

1088
01:29:37,622 --> 01:29:40,665
Has the jury reached a verdict
upon which you are all agreed?

1089
01:29:40,792 --> 01:29:42,417
Yes.

1090
01:29:49,509 --> 01:29:52,302
Will the defendant please stand?

1091
01:29:53,304 --> 01:29:58,767
Members of the jury, how do you find
the defendant? Guilty or not guilty?

1092
01:29:58,893 --> 01:30:00,727
Not guilty.

1093
01:30:00,853 --> 01:30:03,647
Mr Marks, you are free to go.

1094

- Promise me you'll never deal drugs again.
- I promise.

1099
01:30:29,465 --> 01:30:31,425
- Look me in the eye and say it.
- I promise.

1100
01:30:34,345 --> 01:30:40,142
The city of Palma is a delightful mixture of
medieval, ltalian and Moorish architecture.

1103
01:30:57,702 --> 01:31:00,287
I set up a wine import business.

1104
01:31:00,413 --> 01:31:02,664
Meticulous accounts were maintained,

1105
01:31:02,790 --> 01:31:06,793
and national insurance, income tax,
graduated pensions,

1106
01:31:06,919 --> 01:31:12,132
corporation tax and vaIue-added tax
were most conscientiousIy paid.

1107
01:31:12,258 --> 01:31:15,886
I was very busy and very straight.

1108
01:31:17,138 --> 01:31:19,222

01:35:27,888 --> 01:35:30,140
he was bitten by the dog.

1168
01:35:30,266 --> 01:35:34,686
- Your dog.
- M-my... My dog is sick?

1169
01:35:34,812 --> 01:35:38,565
- Your dog has rabies.
- OK, erm...

1170
01:35:39,650 --> 01:35:42,777
Patrick, I-I'm gonna...
I'm gonna call you back, right?

1171
01:35:42,903 --> 01:35:45,572
In a couple of hours. I'll call you back, OK?

1172
01:35:45,698 --> 01:35:48,950
- Howard, call me.
- OK.

1173
01:36:00,004 --> 01:36:02,756
(Sirens wail)

1174
01:36:20,775 --> 01:36:23,443
Are you Patrick Lane? You're under arrest.

1175
01:36:26,489 --> 01:36:31,117
- The girls don't wanna go. Nor do I.
- Listen, we'll enjoy it when we get there.

1176
01:36:31,243 --> 01:36:34,579
- I'm tired.
- You like curry. You love it.

1177
01:36:34,705 --> 01:36:37,582
Yes, you do.
We can do a poppadom smash.

1178
01:36:37,708 --> 01:36:39,375
You'll spend ten minutes eating curry.

1179
01:36:39,502 --> 01:36:42,086
Then you'll be in Taki's bar
and I'll be stuck with the kids.

1180
01:36:42,213 --> 01:36:44,172
(Camera shutter clicks repeatedly)

1181
01:36:44,298 --> 01:36:46,925
One, two, three...

1182
01:36:48,177 --> 01:36:51,012
Poppadom smash up! Cornflakes!

1183
01:36:51,138 --> 01:36:52,931
Our favourite bit!

1184
01:36:56,101 --> 01:36:59,604
War on drugs.
What the fuck is a war?

1185
01:36:59,730 --> 01:37:02,774
How can you declare war
on a fucking drug?

1186
01:37:03,943 --> 01:37:08,279
It's a plant.
Most drugs are derivatives of plants.

1187
01:37:08,405 --> 01:37:10,740
How can you declare war on fucking plants?

1188
01:37:10,866 --> 01:37:12,909
- Howard, why don't you stop?
- Stop what?

1189
01:37:13,035 --> 01:37:16,871
- Just stop.
- I'm feeding my family, right?

1190
01:37:16,997 --> 01:37:19,332
I'm scared.
Scared they're gonna bust you.

1191
01:37:19,458 --> 01:37:21,543
They're not gonna bust me here.

1192
01:37:23,337 --> 01:37:26,548
Don't be scared. Listen, listen.

1193
01:37:28,050 --> 01:37:30,260
Look at this. I don't wanna lose this.

1194
01:37:32,638 --> 01:37:35,431
I wanna be a husband and a father.

1195
01:37:37,184 --> 01:37:39,602
I don't wanna miss out on that.

1196
01:37:41,063 --> 01:37:43,314
You know, I was gonna slow up.

1197
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:47,527
Now I'm...
Already I'm a middle man now.

1198
01:37:47,653 --> 01:37:52,031
You know? In two years' time we'll be...
we'll be legit.

1199
01:37:52,783 --> 01:37:54,242
Really?

1200
01:37:56,203 --> 01:37:57,537
Really.

1201
01:37:58,581 --> 01:38:01,249
Angel, my angel.

1202
01:38:03,669 --> 01:38:05,753
I love you.

1203
01:38:06,922 --> 01:38:09,007
I love you so much.

1204
01:38:10,968 --> 01:38:13,720
- (Girls laugh)
- Hey!

1205
01:38:13,846 --> 01:38:15,930
Stop...that.

1206
01:38:20,936 --> 01:38:23,021
I've got to make a phone call.

1207
01:38:30,779 --> 01:38:32,864
(Ringing)

1208
01:38:34,283 --> 01:38:36,367
(Rings)

1209
01:38:43,959 --> 01:38:46,044
(Phone rings)

1210
01:38:52,718 --> 01:38:54,469
Hello.

1211
01:38:55,346 --> 01:38:57,096
Hello?

1212
01:38:57,222 --> 01:38:59,307
(Click, dialling tone)

1213
01:39:00,643 --> 01:39:03,603
- Amber, pour me the juice. I can't get it.
- Come on, girls.

1214
01:39:03,729 --> 01:39:06,397
Amber, pass the orange juice.

1215
01:39:11,862 --> 01:39:15,740
- (Gate intercom buzzes)
- Hey, don't touch Daddy's box, OK?

1216
01:39:19,203 --> 01:39:22,330
- (Buzzing)
- Hello?

1217
01:39:22,456 --> 01:39:25,083
Oh, Dave. Yeah, yeah, I'll buzz you in.

1218
01:39:25,209 --> 01:39:27,293
(Buzzing)

1219
01:39:31,298 --> 01:39:32,715
Oi, oi!

1220
01:39:35,386 --> 01:39:37,178
It's not exactly tennis weather, is it?

1221
01:39:37,304 --> 01:39:40,306
Well, you never know,
it might brighten up a bit.

1222
01:39:40,432 --> 01:39:42,558
Yeah. Mmm.

1223
01:39:42,685 --> 01:39:47,146
- But if not, I'll get something warmer on...
- Put something on and come in for a spliff.

1224
01:39:47,272 --> 01:39:48,731
See you in a minute.

1225
01:39:50,484 --> 01:39:53,778
- (Intercom buzzes)
- See you in a minute, girls.

1226
01:40:08,210 --> 01:40:10,294
Hello. Can I help you?

1227
01:40:16,927 --> 01:40:20,096
Tranquillo. Tranquillo.

1228
01:40:21,181 --> 01:40:24,392
- OK.
- Stop, stop, stop, stop. Stop, stop.

1229
01:40:28,022 --> 01:40:30,106
(Children scream)

1230
01:40:34,987 --> 01:40:37,071
- (Screaming)
- (Howard) Hey, hey, hey!

1231
01:40:40,701 --> 01:40:42,785
(Screaming and shouting)

1232
01:40:54,590 --> 01:40:56,382
(Loud scream)

1233
01:40:57,926 --> 01:41:00,094
Let's have him now.
Come on, bring him to the car.

1234
01:41:00,220 --> 01:41:02,221
- Vamos.
- (Baby crying)

1235
01:41:02,347 --> 01:41:04,432
- Judy.
- Vamos.

1236
01:41:05,267 --> 01:41:07,685
I wanna see my wife and children
before I go.

1237
01:41:08,312 --> 01:41:10,521
- I wanna see my wife and children.
- Later.

1238
01:41:15,986 --> 01:41:18,071
- Dave.
- What's going on here?

1239
01:41:19,948 --> 01:41:23,451
- What's going on?
- Just see the kids are OK, and Judy, OK?

1240
01:41:30,250 --> 01:41:31,209
(Baby cries)

1241
01:41:31,335 --> 01:41:33,419
(Judy sobs)

1242
01:41:35,631 --> 01:41:37,715
No!

1243
01:41:42,805 --> 01:41:47,016
ln Britain, the United States, Spain and
other countries spanning three continents,

1244
01:41:47,142 --> 01:41:49,977
the men who wage war
against the drug traffickers

1245
01:41:50,104 --> 01:41:53,106
have been ceIebrating the success
of Operation Lynx.

1246
01:41:53,232 --> 01:41:57,527
After more than two years of undercover
work, it's culminated in a series of arrests

1247
01:41:57,653 --> 01:42:02,406
and the smashing of what's being caIIed
one of the world's biggest drugs rings,

1248
01:42:02,533 --> 01:42:07,620
a ring aIIegedIy masterminded by a Briton,
Dennis Marks, who is aged 43.

1249
01:42:07,746 --> 01:42:10,206
This afternoon, he, his wife
and another British citizen

1250
01:42:10,332 --> 01:42:14,001
appeared in court in PaIma, Majorca,
where they've been Iiving.

1251
01:42:14,128 --> 01:42:16,212
They face extradition to the United States.

1252
01:42:16,338 --> 01:42:20,216
We're an innocent coupIe with a famiIy.

1253
01:42:20,342 --> 01:42:24,428
AII we want... We just wanna be with our
children. We wanna be with our children.

1254
01:42:24,555 --> 01:42:29,058
There is no reason in the world why my wife
should be locked up in this establishment.

1255
01:42:29,184 --> 01:42:33,771
She has committed no crime. The children
are with their aunt at the moment.

1256
01:42:33,897 --> 01:42:37,358
Of course,
we're both desperate to see them.

1257
01:42:37,484 --> 01:42:42,280
(TV) It Iooks as if Marks and the others
will be extradited to Miami within days.

1258
01:42:42,406 --> 01:42:45,867
Spanish police have cooperated fully
with both the investigation and the arrests.

1259
01:42:45,993 --> 01:42:48,661
Spain is unIikeIy to act as a haven.

1260
01:42:55,460 --> 01:42:59,172
- Please state your name for the record.
- Patrick Lane.

1261
01:42:59,298 --> 01:43:03,885
No way can I become a snitch, a grass,

1262
01:43:04,011 --> 01:43:08,181
a chivato, a stooI pigeon, a squeaIer,

1263
01:43:08,307 --> 01:43:12,310
a rat, a traitor, a wrong 'un,

1264
01:43:12,436 --> 01:43:16,355
a betrayer, a Judas.

1265
01:43:16,481 --> 01:43:20,193
How would you describe your function
in the Marks cartel?

1266
01:43:20,319 --> 01:43:21,819
Guilty.

1267
01:43:21,945 --> 01:43:23,696
In your witness statement, Mr Malik,

1268
01:43:23,822 --> 01:43:28,201
you suggested that you were responsible
for creating in factories in Afghanistan

1269
01:43:28,327 --> 01:43:31,579
hashish that was distributed by Mr Marks.
Is that true?

1270
01:43:32,998 --> 01:43:35,666
- Guilty.
- Mr Malik, please.

1271
01:43:35,792 --> 01:43:39,503
We expect that you will answer the question
to the best of your ability.

1272
01:43:39,630 --> 01:43:41,172
Please answer the question.

1273
01:43:41,298 --> 01:43:43,883
- Could you repeat the question, please?
- Yes.

1274
01:43:44,009 --> 01:43:47,053
- Now we're getting somewhere.
- Mr Malik,

1275
01:43:47,179 --> 01:43:50,139
what was your role in the Marks cartel?

1276
01:43:54,478 --> 01:43:57,480
- Guilty.
- Who did you take your orders from?

1277
01:43:57,606 --> 01:44:00,107
- Guilty.
- Your Honour...

1278
01:44:00,234 --> 01:44:02,902
This behaviour
will not be tolerated in my court.

1279
01:44:03,987 --> 01:44:06,197
In your opinion, Mr Lane, would you say

1280
01:44:06,323 --> 01:44:12,495
that this business constituted
a drugs organisation with a hierarchy?

1281
01:44:12,621 --> 01:44:13,955
Most definitely.

1282
01:44:14,081 --> 01:44:16,499
And was there somebody
at the top of this hierarchy?

1283
01:44:16,625 --> 01:44:19,669
- Yes.
- Who would that be, Mr Lane?

1284
01:44:19,795 --> 01:44:21,587
It would be Howard Marks.

1285
01:44:21,713 --> 01:44:25,967
Could you please point
to the head of this cartel?

1286
01:44:29,179 --> 01:44:32,890
For the record, I'd just like to point out
that he's addressing Mr Marks.

1287
01:44:33,016 --> 01:44:35,059
Yes, we have that on the record, thank you.

1288
01:44:35,185 --> 01:44:37,270
And in your understanding, Mr Combs,

1289
01:44:37,396 --> 01:44:42,525
who was it you were actually dealing with
in the Marks cartel?

1290
01:44:42,651 --> 01:44:44,485
That would be Howard Marks.

1291
01:44:44,611 --> 01:44:48,281
Would you mind pointing to Mr Marks,
Mr Howard Marks?

1292
01:44:51,493 --> 01:44:54,495
For the record, your Honour,
I'd like to point out who he's pointing to.

1293
01:44:54,621 --> 01:44:56,664
Yes, we have that on the record, thank you.

1294
01:44:56,790 --> 01:44:59,750
Would you mind pointing to Mr Marks?

1295
01:45:00,669 --> 01:45:05,006
Uhh...does the defence have any questions
for this witness?

1296
01:45:05,132 --> 01:45:06,590
No.

1297
01:45:18,061 --> 01:45:20,521
No physical contact.

1298
01:45:20,647 --> 01:45:24,567
You may hold hands. You have 20 minutes.

1299
01:45:24,693 --> 01:45:26,944
Hello, love.

1300
01:45:27,988 --> 01:45:30,489
- (Door slams)
- What's wrong with your hands?

1301
01:45:30,615 --> 01:45:33,909
It's just...
It's just an allergy or something. Stress.

1302
01:45:41,001 --> 01:45:43,586
Are you OK?

1303
01:45:48,258 --> 01:45:52,178
There's a problem. With the kids.

1304
01:45:52,304 --> 01:45:54,013
Wh...

1305
01:45:56,391 --> 01:45:58,642
Asha's boyfriend's become a junkie.

1306
01:45:59,770 --> 01:46:02,480
- He spends his time beating them.
- No.

1307
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:06,484
They've left little Patrick locked in his room.

1308
01:46:06,610 --> 01:46:10,321
No. No. No.

1309
01:46:13,116 --> 01:46:16,077
Amber said he threatened her
if she opened the door.

1310
01:46:16,203 --> 01:46:20,414
- (Sobs) No, no.
- She screamed and screamed.

1311
01:46:20,540 --> 01:46:24,627
No, no, no.

1312
01:46:26,380 --> 01:46:29,298
But it's all right now. It's all right.

1313
01:46:32,177 --> 01:46:35,429
- But I need to be with them.
- I know. I know you do.

1314
01:46:38,016 --> 01:46:39,934
Please.

1315
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:45,189
- They need me.
- I know, Judy. I know.

1316
01:46:46,983 --> 01:46:49,068
Come on, Howard.

1317
01:46:52,864 --> 01:46:54,907
Come on, plead guilty.

1318
01:46:58,745 --> 01:47:00,579
Plead guilty and we'll let Judy go home.

1319
01:47:04,751 --> 01:47:07,336
You've gotta stop using her like this.

1320
01:47:08,380 --> 01:47:10,840
Think of your children.

1321
01:47:10,966 --> 01:47:14,969
The pain....they're suffering.

1322
01:47:22,269 --> 01:47:26,355
Then again,
I couId aIways appear to cooperate.

1323
01:47:26,481 --> 01:47:28,816
Have you heard of a man
named James McCann?

1324
01:47:28,942 --> 01:47:31,193
- (Sirens)
- Fucking Christ.

1325
01:47:31,319 --> 01:47:32,778
Stop my fucking car?

1326
01:47:38,827 --> 01:47:41,579
You don't know
who you're fucking dealing with!

1327
01:47:41,705 --> 01:47:44,457
I'm the Kid! Look at the Kid go!

1328
01:47:45,041 --> 01:47:47,626
(Police officer) Got you covered.

1329
01:47:49,546 --> 01:47:52,381
- Hands in the air!
- Don't make a move.

1330
01:47:53,550 --> 01:47:56,552
I am Captain James McCann

1331
01:47:56,678 --> 01:47:59,221
of the Provisional Irish Republican Army.

1332
01:47:59,347 --> 01:48:03,809
And I am surrendering
to tools of the British Empire,

1333
01:48:03,935 --> 01:48:06,520
and I demand the status of prisoner of war.

1334
01:48:07,772 --> 01:48:11,192
This'll be a grand story
in the bars on St Paddy's Day, fellas, eh?

1335
01:48:11,318 --> 01:48:14,320
How you helped out the fucking Brits!

1336
01:48:17,365 --> 01:48:20,534
I'm the Emerald Pimpernel!

1337
01:48:31,505 --> 01:48:34,798
This is the case of the United States
versus Howard Marks,

1338
01:48:34,925 --> 01:48:36,592
I see that Mr Marks is present.

1339
01:48:36,718 --> 01:48:39,261
Would the defendant please rise?

1340
01:48:40,931 --> 01:48:46,560
Mr Marks, federal statutes
prohibit trafficking in marijuana.

1341
01:48:46,686 --> 01:48:49,897
I have taken an oath to administerjustice,

1342
01:48:50,023 --> 01:48:54,276
and to perform all duties
agreeable to the laws of the United States.

1343
01:48:56,279 --> 01:49:00,991
So, even if I were, uh, to agree

1344
01:49:01,117 --> 01:49:05,538
that the laws concerning
the use and sale of marijuana

1345
01:49:05,664 --> 01:49:08,332
were inappropriate, even foolish,

1346
01:49:09,543 --> 01:49:14,213
I would have to abide by them
until Congress has repealed them.

1347
01:49:14,339 --> 01:49:16,423
I impose the following sentence.

1348
01:49:16,550 --> 01:49:20,803
As to Count One of the indictment,
for a term of ten years.

1349
01:49:20,929 --> 01:49:23,347
As to Count Two of the indictment,

1350
01:49:24,683 --> 01:49:26,767
a term of fifteen years.

1351
01:49:26,893 --> 01:49:30,062
Sentences to run consecutively,

1352
01:49:30,188 --> 01:49:35,609
for a total of twenty-five years.

1353
01:49:38,071 --> 01:49:41,073
- Case is dismissed.
- (Bangs gavel)

1354
01:49:42,701 --> 01:49:45,119
Doing time began to get hard.

1355
01:49:45,245 --> 01:49:49,164
l'd been down for four years
and l had more than another twelve to do,

1356
01:49:49,291 --> 01:49:52,585
as seemed certain
I wouId be denied paroIe.

1357
01:49:52,711 --> 01:49:56,422
Judy couIdn't wait for me that Iong.
No one could.

1358
01:49:57,507 --> 01:50:00,050
At the age of 60,
l would re-enter the world,

1359
01:50:00,176 --> 01:50:05,389
skint, full of hate,
and compIeteIy unempIoyabIe and useIess.

1360
01:50:05,557 --> 01:50:09,184
I wouId be oId and ugIy.
No one wouId want to shag me.

1361
01:50:09,311 --> 01:50:11,270
(Yells)

1362
01:50:11,396 --> 01:50:14,982
l caught shingles
and had several bouts of flu.

1363
01:50:15,942 --> 01:50:18,152
Smoke and phIegm fiIIed my Iungs.

1364
01:50:18,278 --> 01:50:22,031
l couldn't piss properly.
I couIdn't bend my Ieft Ieg.

1365
01:50:22,157 --> 01:50:24,617
I had pains everywhere.

1366
01:50:24,743 --> 01:50:27,161
Abscesses fiIIed my gums.

1367
01:50:27,287 --> 01:50:29,079
Jesus Christ!

1368
01:50:29,205 --> 01:50:32,958
God! Make it fucking stop!

1369
01:50:38,298 --> 01:50:40,382
Please.

1370
01:50:42,302 --> 01:50:46,096
Please help me. Please help me.
Please help me.

1371
01:50:46,222 --> 01:50:48,307
Shh!

1372
01:50:54,022 --> 01:50:56,106
Oh, fucking hell.

1373
01:50:56,941 --> 01:50:59,026
I can't feel a fucking thing.

1374
01:51:05,784 --> 01:51:08,619
(Baby crying)

1375
01:51:14,709 --> 01:51:16,794
Daddy...

1376
01:51:17,504 --> 01:51:20,130
Daddy's coming...

1377
01:51:24,177 --> 01:51:36,480
Daddy...

1378
01:51:37,065 --> 01:51:39,149
(Door slams shut)

1379
01:51:43,363 --> 01:51:46,115
l was given the job
of teaching EngIish grammar

1380
01:51:46,241 --> 01:51:50,035
to prisoners studying
their General Education Diploma.

1381
01:51:50,161 --> 01:51:54,498
Most of my pupiIs were Iooking at
the rest of their life behind bars.

1382
01:51:54,624 --> 01:51:56,500
An inmates' teacher, if not cautious,

1383
01:51:56,626 --> 01:52:00,879
couId find himseIf regarded
as a semi-hack orjaiIhouse snitch.

1384
01:52:01,005 --> 01:52:05,008
I was scared,
but I appIied the usuaI ruIe.

1385
01:52:05,844 --> 01:52:06,969
Never show your fear.

1386
01:52:07,095 --> 01:52:08,262
(Whoops with laughter)

1387
01:52:08,388 --> 01:52:11,098
41526004,

1388
01:52:11,224 --> 01:52:13,851
you can call me Howard.

1389
01:52:13,977 --> 01:52:16,395
And so I became the jaiIhouse Iawyer.

1390
01:52:16,521 --> 01:52:19,440
I wrote to congressmen, judges, Iawyers,

1391
01:52:19,566 --> 01:52:23,777
had some successes,
got convictions overturned.

1392
01:52:25,029 --> 01:52:26,572
To whom it may concern...

1393
01:52:26,698 --> 01:52:30,993
US Immigration wouId not aIIow Judy
back into the country to visit me

1394
01:52:31,119 --> 01:52:33,412
because she had a conviction.

1395
01:52:34,372 --> 01:52:36,832
But that couId not stop the kids.

1396
01:52:50,513 --> 01:52:53,140
I thought Amber was Judy.

1397
01:52:58,730 --> 01:53:03,275
When I finaIIy saw Francesca,
she Iooked Iike my memory of Myfanwy.

1398
01:53:03,401 --> 01:53:08,280
Myfanwy wanted to share
her sixteenth birthday with me.

1399
01:53:08,406 --> 01:53:12,910
I had five days of heavenIy visits.
l loved them so much.

1400
01:53:17,290 --> 01:53:20,584
Since he joined the education programme,
these kids, some got out.

1401
01:53:20,710 --> 01:53:23,378
Even those that are staying
have learned to read, to write...

1402
01:53:23,505 --> 01:53:26,757
There was no reason whatsoever
to think that anything had changed

1403
01:53:26,883 --> 01:53:30,469
with respect to the big dope deaIers
never being granted parole.

1404
01:53:30,595 --> 01:53:32,346
But I went through the motions

1405
01:53:32,472 --> 01:53:35,390
and turned up in the prison
paroIe hearing rooms

1406
01:53:35,517 --> 01:53:39,394
to present my case
on the Iast day of January 1995.

1407
01:53:39,521 --> 01:53:43,065
Mr Marks, due to evidence that
the recommendation you spend

1408
01:53:43,191 --> 01:53:45,692
the majority of your sentence
in the UK was ignored,

1409
01:53:45,819 --> 01:53:49,571
because of pleadings by the DEA
for you to remain in Terre Haute

1410
01:53:49,697 --> 01:53:53,575
your sentence has turned out harsher
than the court originally intended.

1411
01:53:53,701 --> 01:53:57,538
In light of this, I am recommending to the
United States Regional Parole Commission

1412
01:53:57,664 --> 01:54:00,165
for you to be released on parole
on March 20th.

1413
01:54:11,928 --> 01:54:14,012
Thank you.

1414
01:54:16,182 --> 01:54:18,517
C-Can I call home please?

1415
01:54:19,519 --> 01:54:20,727
It's OK.

1416
01:55:15,950 --> 01:55:20,370
Like I said, are there any plain-clothes
policemen in the audience tonight?

1417
01:55:22,582 --> 01:55:24,625
Thank fuck for that.

1418
01:55:24,751 --> 01:55:26,835
