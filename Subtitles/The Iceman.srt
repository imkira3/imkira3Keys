2
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,641
Mr. Kuklinski.

3
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:51,006
Do you have any regrets
for the things you've done?

4
00:01:54,925 --> 00:01:57,677
You know,
it's not very polite.

5
00:01:57,764 --> 00:01:59,322
Ask a girl out for coffee,

6
00:01:59,404 --> 00:02:01,838
you should have
something to say.

7
00:02:01,924 --> 00:02:04,996
Like what?
I don't know.

8
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:06,756
You're the one that
asked me here.

9
00:02:12,923 --> 00:02:15,756
So, what do you do for a living?

10
00:02:15,843 --> 00:02:18,437
I dub cartoons for Disney.

11
00:02:18,523 --> 00:02:21,799
No way!
What's your favorite?

12
00:02:21,882 --> 00:02:23,395
Cinderella.

13
00:02:27,322 --> 00:02:28,641
Really?

14
00:02:28,722 --> 00:02:29,996
Yeah.

15
00:02:31,162 --> 00:02:33,118
What is that?

16
00:02:33,202 --> 00:02:35,271
He, he used to be some sort
of devil, I think.

17
00:02:35,361 --> 00:02:36,953
I don't know.

18
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:38,679
I was trying to look tough,
I guess.

19
00:02:38,761 --> 00:02:40,558
How come?

20
00:02:40,681 --> 00:02:42,433
Does it bother you?

21
00:02:42,521 --> 00:02:45,957
Not at all.

22
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:51,034
You're, uh, you're a, you're
a prettier version of...

23
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,588
What?

24
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,676
Nah. No, what were
you going to say?

25
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,318
Um, uh...

26
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,799
You were going to say something.
What?

27
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,199
No. Nothing.

28
00:03:02,359 --> 00:03:04,793
So, you got any family, or...?

29
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,350
Yeah, my sister and brother are
around somewhere, I guess.

30
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,430
What, you don't talk to them?

31
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,830
Not really. They're lousy
conversationalists.

32
00:03:15,918 --> 00:03:19,672
Well, I guess it runs
in the family.

33
00:03:19,758 --> 00:03:22,397
Most people I talk to don't
have nothing to say.

34
00:03:22,478 --> 00:03:26,153
No, I... I didn't mean
anything. I just...

35
00:03:26,238 --> 00:03:28,307
I get nervous
around new people.

36
00:03:28,397 --> 00:03:30,433
I didn't mean you.

37
00:03:30,517 --> 00:03:32,394
No? Okay.

38
00:03:36,597 --> 00:03:39,907
You're a prettier version
of Natalie Wood.

39
00:03:39,997 --> 00:03:42,669
I don't look anything like her.

40
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,553
To me, you do.

41
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:50,593
Cheers.

42
00:03:50,676 --> 00:03:52,394
I thought it was bad luck
to cheer with water.

43
00:03:52,476 --> 00:03:55,148
I don't believe in bad luck.

44
00:04:10,634 --> 00:04:12,545
Oh, you're funny.

45
00:04:12,634 --> 00:04:14,033
I hope so.

46
00:04:17,474 --> 00:04:20,909
I'm sorry.
My aunt is always late.

47
00:04:20,993 --> 00:04:22,790
You don't have
to wait.

48
00:04:22,873 --> 00:04:23,908
I don't mind.

49
00:04:25,313 --> 00:04:27,429
I had a really good time.

50
00:04:27,513 --> 00:04:29,310
I'm glad
you insisted.

51
00:04:32,073 --> 00:04:33,585
You mind if I call you again?

52
00:04:33,672 --> 00:04:35,390
Please do.
That would be great.

53
00:04:35,472 --> 00:04:37,463
Um, here she is.

54
00:04:46,111 --> 00:04:47,464
Goodnight.

55
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:17,705
It's Earl, right?

56
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:19,268
What do you do?

57
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:21,738
I do business.
I'm a businessman.

58
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:23,342
Ask Terry.
He knows.

59
00:05:23,429 --> 00:05:25,180
Yeah. He delivers,
uh, fucking diapers.

60
00:05:26,348 --> 00:05:27,861
What do you do?

61
00:05:27,948 --> 00:05:29,700
Me and Ritchie,
we make porno movies.

62
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:31,779
Yeah, we dub 'em.

63
00:05:31,868 --> 00:05:35,099
So, Terry, which one of these guys
dates that girl Deborah?

64
00:05:35,188 --> 00:05:36,940
That'll be Ritchie.

65
00:05:37,068 --> 00:05:38,864
Yeah?
Yeah, how do you know Deborah?

66
00:05:38,947 --> 00:05:40,858
My friend Danny
went out with her.

67
00:05:40,947 --> 00:05:42,778
Girl waited three weeks

68
00:05:42,867 --> 00:05:44,778
to tell him she doesn't have sex
'til she's married.

69
00:05:44,867 --> 00:05:47,939
Hey, Earl, have some fucking
respect, okay?

70
00:05:48,027 --> 00:05:49,779
It's his future wife
you're talking about.

71
00:05:49,867 --> 00:05:51,458
I guess, if he's
desperate enough.

72
00:05:51,546 --> 00:05:52,979
Ooh.

73
00:05:55,546 --> 00:05:58,618
Yeah, I'm
pretty desperate.

74
00:05:58,706 --> 00:06:01,857
But, where there's a will...

75
00:06:04,346 --> 00:06:06,301
Oh! Nice
shot, Ritchie.

76
00:06:06,385 --> 00:06:09,377
There's a way,
my friend.

77
00:06:09,465 --> 00:06:13,378
Good shot,
Ritchie. Jesus.

78
00:06:13,505 --> 00:06:14,984
Nice.
Whoa.

79
00:06:15,065 --> 00:06:17,658
Where there's a will,
there's a way.

80
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:22,340
Unbelievable, man.
Good job.

81
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:23,982
Hey, what the fuck
you think you're doing?

82
00:06:24,064 --> 00:06:25,895
No, what is this, man?
Come on. What?

83
00:06:25,984 --> 00:06:27,975
This asshole turns you down,
so I take the bait?

84
00:06:28,064 --> 00:06:30,180
Easy, Earl, you just
pay what you owe.

85
00:06:33,823 --> 00:06:35,654
No, I'm not paying
you anything.

86
00:06:35,743 --> 00:06:39,258
Put the money
on the table.

87
00:06:39,343 --> 00:06:42,096
Put that money
on the table.

88
00:06:44,662 --> 00:06:46,175
Trust me.

89
00:06:46,262 --> 00:06:48,093
Take your money.
All right, go.

90
00:06:48,182 --> 00:06:50,935
Go to your porn lab,
jerk off with your friends.

91
00:06:51,022 --> 00:06:52,740
I'm going to fuck
a real woman tonight.

92
00:06:52,822 --> 00:06:54,619
Wow.

93
00:06:54,702 --> 00:06:58,330
And good luck getting
your dick in her.

94
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:01,021
Take a walk.
It's not worth it, Rich.

95
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:02,819
Yeah, Ritchie,
don't sweat that.

96
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,728
Not worth it.

97
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,497
come on,
stack 'em up.

98
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,456
Ah!

99
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:19,492
Dr. Hunter,
to Delivery, please.

100
00:08:19,575 --> 00:08:22,248
Dr. Hunter, to Delivery, please.

101
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,405
Mr. Kuklinski?
Yeah.

102
00:08:24,495 --> 00:08:27,089
Your wife and daughter are in recovery.
They're doing fine.

103
00:08:27,175 --> 00:08:31,008
Oh, thanks. Thanks.
Uh, can I see them?

104
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,652
Come with me.
All right.

105
00:08:36,134 --> 00:08:37,328
They're in here.

106
00:08:41,414 --> 00:08:43,085
Oh, wow.
They're asleep now.

107
00:08:53,813 --> 00:08:56,280
Congratulations,
you're a father.

108
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,760
Yeah.
Ritchie.

109
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,040
What the fuck's the matter
with you? You still there?

110
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,802
We're still
seven boxes short.

111
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,721
They called me
twice already.

112
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,926
They're probably on the way
over there as we speak.

113
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:36,045
Don't we got any shoes to give,
it's the wrong date?

114
00:09:36,129 --> 00:09:37,960
Roy Demeo is with them.
This fucking guy is crazy.

115
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:39,920
Go home to your family.
Trust me on this. Okay.

116
00:09:40,009 --> 00:09:42,159
Hang up the phone and walk out.
You hear me, Ritchie?

117
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,444
All right.

118
00:09:53,408 --> 00:09:55,000
What's this guy's name?

119
00:09:55,088 --> 00:09:57,204
Dino Lapron.

120
00:09:57,288 --> 00:09:59,279
Lapron?

121
00:09:59,368 --> 00:10:01,756
He's probably going to accuse me
of fucking up the dates.

122
00:10:01,847 --> 00:10:03,246
Did you?

123
00:10:03,327 --> 00:10:04,442
What kind of question is that?

124
00:10:04,527 --> 00:10:05,516
Yes or no?
Did you?

125
00:10:05,607 --> 00:10:07,438
No.

126
00:10:07,527 --> 00:10:09,119
Are you Lapron?

127
00:10:09,207 --> 00:10:10,799
Excuse me?
You Dino Lapron?

128
00:10:10,887 --> 00:10:12,400
That's not him, Roy.

129
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:14,124
Where's Dino Lapron?
He's not here.

130
00:10:14,206 --> 00:10:16,879
Open the door.
There's nobody in here.

131
00:10:16,966 --> 00:10:18,524
Just open the door.

132
00:10:18,646 --> 00:10:21,319
Let's go.
You're coming.

133
00:10:35,685 --> 00:10:39,996
Seen any good movies lately?
I don't really watch them.

134
00:10:40,124 --> 00:10:41,637
I'm not
into porn myself,

135
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,716
but I got to look out
for my customers.

136
00:10:44,804 --> 00:10:46,635
What do you got
for us?

137
00:10:46,724 --> 00:10:48,635
Well, Dino had the date
for the 28th, you know?

138
00:10:48,724 --> 00:10:51,318
We can't take the blame if you
change it last minute.

139
00:10:51,404 --> 00:10:53,234
Hey. That's
fucking bullshit.

140
00:10:53,323 --> 00:10:55,632
That's not what
I asked you.

141
00:10:55,763 --> 00:10:58,038
We're seven boxes short.

142
00:10:58,163 --> 00:11:00,757
Seven. We gotta adjust the machines
when they run all week.

143
00:11:00,843 --> 00:11:02,720
If somebody
would of told us

144
00:11:02,803 --> 00:11:04,555
they needed the order
earlier we could have...

145
00:11:08,242 --> 00:11:10,358
You like that? Huh?

146
00:11:10,442 --> 00:11:11,875
You got something
to say to me,

147
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,634
you say it
to my fucking face.

148
00:11:13,722 --> 00:11:15,474
You fuck us and try
to act like a tough guy?

149
00:11:15,562 --> 00:11:17,041
If I work all night they'll
be finished tomorrow.

150
00:11:17,122 --> 00:11:19,271
Hey, look at me.
Stupid fuck.

151
00:11:19,361 --> 00:11:21,636
Tell me the truth.

152
00:11:21,721 --> 00:11:23,359
Let's kill the fucking guy.
Fuck Lapron.

153
00:11:23,441 --> 00:11:27,070
Put the gun down.

154
00:11:27,161 --> 00:11:29,197
I didn't fuck nothing up.
I'll fuck you up. Come on.

155
00:11:29,281 --> 00:11:31,556
I'll smack you
in the fucking mouth.

156
00:11:31,641 --> 00:11:33,437
What's your name?

157
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,397
Ritchie Kuklinski.

158
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,511
You know who I am?
Mm-hm.

159
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,797
So if I came down here,
I must have had a good reason.

160
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,791
I didn't say you didn't have
a good reason,

161
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,028
I said the date was...

162
00:11:52,719 --> 00:11:54,391
If you want to complain
about life,

163
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:57,437
you're talking to the wrong
fucking guy.

164
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:03,388
You'll have this done
by tomorrow? Yes?

165
00:12:03,478 --> 00:12:05,434
All right, good.

166
00:12:05,518 --> 00:12:08,476
Let's get the fuck
out of here.

167
00:12:45,355 --> 00:12:46,674
Hey.

168
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:51,313
We're at
the Gemini Lounge.

169
00:12:51,394 --> 00:12:53,624
It's on Flatlands
near the parkway.

170
00:12:53,714 --> 00:12:56,182
I'll drop the prints
off tomorrow.

171
00:12:56,274 --> 00:13:02,190
It's got nothing to do with that.
Roy wants to see you.

172
00:13:02,274 --> 00:13:03,547
Just be there.

173
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,823
There.
It's okay.

174
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:02,066
Well, what's Mommy
been looking at?

175
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:05,660
Four bedrooms.

176
00:14:05,749 --> 00:14:08,104
Is this a private
conversation?

177
00:14:08,189 --> 00:14:09,826
Yeah, she's doing
all the talking.

178
00:14:09,948 --> 00:14:11,859
Well, so don't mind me.
Did I wake you up?

179
00:14:11,988 --> 00:14:13,944
No, I have
to feed her.

180
00:14:14,028 --> 00:14:15,507
Huh?

181
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:17,340
Oh.

182
00:14:17,428 --> 00:14:21,387
So, what were you
two talking about?

183
00:14:21,468 --> 00:14:24,345
She says she don't
like living here.

184
00:14:24,427 --> 00:14:26,418
She wants a four-bedroom
in Dumars.

185
00:14:26,507 --> 00:14:30,944
Well, she's got good taste,
our daughter.

186
00:14:31,027 --> 00:14:35,577
Did you just get home?
Yeah, not long ago.

187
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:39,784
Hm. It's so late.

188
00:14:39,866 --> 00:14:41,697
How was your day?

189
00:14:41,786 --> 00:14:43,378
It was good.
What happened to your hand?

190
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:46,060
Eh, some jerk left
some film cans out,

191
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:47,460
I almost fell
on my face.

192
00:14:49,425 --> 00:14:54,977
So, what do
we got here?

193
00:14:55,065 --> 00:14:58,740
Oh, it's just Vice President
Nixon's house.

194
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:00,264
He just put it
on the market.

195
00:15:00,345 --> 00:15:01,663
You want
to look at it?

196
00:15:01,744 --> 00:15:03,860
Sure.

197
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,094
Why are
you laughing?

198
00:15:06,184 --> 00:15:10,621
If we could afford an apartment
in Hoboken I'd be happy, Ritchie.

199
00:15:10,704 --> 00:15:12,137
No, you wouldn't.

200
00:15:12,224 --> 00:15:14,498
You think
I'm a spoiled brat.

201
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,653
No. You like to be
taken care of.

202
00:15:16,743 --> 00:15:19,177
There's nothing
wrong with that.

203
00:15:19,263 --> 00:15:22,061
I like the way
you take care of me.

204
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,129
Thank you.

205
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,491
Hey, the guy from the porn
lab's here.

206
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,252
You want me
to bring him up?

207
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:10,011
Nah.
Let him wait.

208
00:16:10,099 --> 00:16:11,930
Come here.
Sit down, I want to talk to you.

209
00:16:15,939 --> 00:16:18,499
Yeah.
What is it?

210
00:16:21,018 --> 00:16:23,532
You're really keeping that
mustache, huh?

211
00:16:23,618 --> 00:16:25,768
Why, you
don't like it?

212
00:16:25,858 --> 00:16:27,849
Nah, it just doesn't seem like
it goes with your face.

213
00:16:30,738 --> 00:16:32,296
Listen to me.

214
00:16:32,378 --> 00:16:34,937
The word's come
to me from the city

215
00:16:35,017 --> 00:16:37,326
that you're using
my name again, Josh.

216
00:16:37,417 --> 00:16:39,806
No, I...

217
00:16:39,937 --> 00:16:42,087
No, not really.
Not really?

218
00:16:42,177 --> 00:16:44,088
No, it was just, it was
just for the Westies.

219
00:16:44,177 --> 00:16:46,008
I didn't want to walk in there
for the deal,

220
00:16:46,096 --> 00:16:47,893
and with them thinking I'm
nobody, Roy.

221
00:16:47,976 --> 00:16:50,092
I'm not going to use Rosenthal.
It's too Jewish.

222
00:16:50,216 --> 00:16:54,209
You don't respect yourself to
use your own name?

223
00:16:54,296 --> 00:16:56,651
That only makes
you look weak.

224
00:16:56,736 --> 00:17:00,250
Listen to me. You and I,
we have a history together.

225
00:17:00,335 --> 00:17:02,326
That means
something to me.

226
00:17:02,415 --> 00:17:04,007
It means something
to me, too.

227
00:17:04,095 --> 00:17:05,813
Yeah?

228
00:17:05,895 --> 00:17:07,533
It won't happen again.

229
00:17:10,575 --> 00:17:12,929
All right, let's go see what this
guy's made of. Come on.

230
00:17:13,014 --> 00:17:14,367
Let's take this guy for a ride.

231
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:25,724
Kulinski? Kolinsky?
Josh, pull over here.

232
00:17:29,053 --> 00:17:32,443
So... Kulinksi?
Kolinsky?

233
00:17:32,533 --> 00:17:34,046
How, how do you
say it? Who?

234
00:17:34,173 --> 00:17:36,209
Kuklinski.

235
00:17:36,293 --> 00:17:38,284
Kuklinski? With a... with a K?
Or is, what is that?

236
00:17:38,373 --> 00:17:40,488
A "C" or a "K"?
A "K."

237
00:17:40,572 --> 00:17:43,211
"Ski. " That's a "ski", "skis" are
Polish, right? You're a Polack?

238
00:17:43,292 --> 00:17:45,408
Yeah.
Yeah?

239
00:17:45,492 --> 00:17:47,369
Get away from the car.
Get away.

240
00:17:47,452 --> 00:17:48,601
Can you spare
some change?

241
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,205
Get away.
Take a walk!

242
00:17:50,292 --> 00:17:51,565
Would it kill you
to give me a dime?

243
00:17:51,651 --> 00:17:54,324
Hey! Scumbag!

244
00:17:54,411 --> 00:17:57,687
Scicoli, here's a quarter.
You should go give it to him.

245
00:17:57,771 --> 00:17:59,568
Go give it to him.
What?

246
00:17:59,651 --> 00:18:01,801
Guy's not going to last
an hour in this weather.

247
00:18:01,931 --> 00:18:04,081
He's a fucking' reefer addict.
Have some heart. It's the holidays.

248
00:18:04,171 --> 00:18:08,049
Come on, Roy, why do
I got to freeze for a fucking skivatz?

249
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,519
Here, give me the quarter.
I'll give him the quarter.

250
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:14,888
I'll give him the fucking quarter.
Fucking give him a holiday quarter?

251
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,403
The fucking skivatz.

252
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:22,485
Kuklinski.
Kuklinski.

253
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:23,922
There you go!

254
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:29,727
Okay, I gave him
the quarter.

255
00:18:29,849 --> 00:18:32,806
Don't you feel
better about yourself?

256
00:18:32,888 --> 00:18:35,721
Yeah. You did something
nice for somebody.

257
00:18:35,808 --> 00:18:36,923
That's the fucking spirit.

258
00:18:41,248 --> 00:18:42,806
Look at that.

259
00:18:46,407 --> 00:18:48,682
Fucking guy's
cold as ice.

260
00:18:50,647 --> 00:18:52,763
Come on, you got to feel
something for somebody.

261
00:18:55,207 --> 00:18:56,481
Got a girlfriend?

262
00:18:56,567 --> 00:18:58,602
I'm married.

263
00:18:58,686 --> 00:19:02,281
Then why do you act like
you don't give a shit?

264
00:19:02,366 --> 00:19:03,401
What do you want?

265
00:19:10,205 --> 00:19:11,923
I'm closing
the porn lab.

266
00:19:13,565 --> 00:19:16,796
Sorry, but you're
out of a job.

267
00:19:16,885 --> 00:19:21,879
If you could follow orders,
you got everything to gain.

268
00:19:26,564 --> 00:19:30,443
Go put the bum
out of his misery.

269
00:19:32,684 --> 00:19:36,233
If you don't have it in you,
now's the time to say it.

270
00:20:10,161 --> 00:20:12,914
God almighty.
You got big hands.

271
00:20:13,001 --> 00:20:14,514
Are you a lumberjack
or something?

272
00:20:14,601 --> 00:20:17,592
No, I'm Polish.

273
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,518
Mind if I sit down?

274
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,478
It's your ass.
Put it where you want it.

275
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:31,428
No.

276
00:20:44,878 --> 00:20:46,869
What the fuck is this?
What's he doing now?

277
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,677
Shut the fuck up.
Just give him a second.

278
00:20:53,918 --> 00:20:58,513
Actually, I will have a drag.
What are you smoking? Camel...

279
00:21:06,237 --> 00:21:08,227
Come on.

280
00:21:16,636 --> 00:21:18,866
You all right?
Yeah.

281
00:21:18,956 --> 00:21:22,311
Not that big of a deal, is it?

282
00:21:22,395 --> 00:21:24,465
I know nobody forced
you to do anything

283
00:21:24,595 --> 00:21:26,233
but, I'm going to need a
guarantee of your loyalty.

284
00:21:26,315 --> 00:21:27,634
Give me the gun.

285
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:35,187
This is for you.

286
00:21:39,114 --> 00:21:40,672
What you're going
to be doing is

287
00:21:40,754 --> 00:21:42,745
you'll be watching my back.

288
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:44,187
You'll be collecting debts,
sending messages,

289
00:21:44,274 --> 00:21:46,663
whatever the messages are.

290
00:21:46,754 --> 00:21:50,109
But if I need you, Scicoli or Josh here
is going to get in contact with you.

291
00:21:50,193 --> 00:21:51,626
And payphones only.

292
00:21:54,353 --> 00:21:57,789
Now, you're going to deal with
whatever we can, for whatever reason.

293
00:22:01,232 --> 00:22:03,666
You're only going to work
for me, nobody else.

294
00:22:07,112 --> 00:22:08,101
You understand?

295
00:22:09,192 --> 00:22:10,181
Sure.

296
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:36,025
Puh... please.
I got some money upstairs.

297
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:40,341
I beg of you, please?
Please?

298
00:22:40,429 --> 00:22:42,579
Anything you want.
Anything, just...

299
00:23:27,986 --> 00:23:30,341
I give thanks for my
beautiful wife, Deborah.

300
00:23:30,426 --> 00:23:32,097
She means
the world to me.

301
00:23:32,185 --> 00:23:34,096
And she's carrying
our baby.

302
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,696
Hey, honey.
Hi.

303
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:47,133
Oh, sorry.
It's okay.

304
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,131
Hi, Dad.
Take this.

305
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,698
Thank you.
Is that everything?

306
00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:52,098
Yeah.
Perfect.

307
00:24:52,179 --> 00:24:54,056
Yeah.
You got it?

308
00:24:54,139 --> 00:24:55,413
Yeah, I got it.

309
00:24:55,539 --> 00:24:57,609
How was school?
It was good.

310
00:25:02,139 --> 00:25:03,935
That's good wine,
isn't it?

311
00:25:04,018 --> 00:25:05,610
For that price,
it better be.

312
00:25:05,698 --> 00:25:07,734
So how'd you guys meet?
You two?

313
00:25:07,818 --> 00:25:10,252
Oh, we met on a boat.
Really?

314
00:25:10,338 --> 00:25:12,488
Yeah. Like, big yacht,
one of those big fancy boats?

315
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:14,808
The one you can eat and
drink anything you want on?

316
00:25:14,898 --> 00:25:16,774
So I'm in the bath
and I hear this voice

317
00:25:16,857 --> 00:25:18,893
from this other
stall, right?

318
00:25:19,057 --> 00:25:20,934
A little mousy voice.
Oh.

319
00:25:21,017 --> 00:25:23,167
And it goes, "Excuse me?"

320
00:25:23,297 --> 00:25:27,495
"Excuse me? Is there somebody in
the other stall?" I was locked in.

321
00:25:27,577 --> 00:25:30,044
Yeah, right. If you ask me, she
followed somebody in there.

322
00:25:30,136 --> 00:25:32,286
There was a huge line
for the girls room.

323
00:25:32,376 --> 00:25:34,128
How'd you meet Ritchie?

324
00:25:34,216 --> 00:25:37,094
Uh, it, it doesn't compare
to the bathroom story.

325
00:25:37,176 --> 00:25:39,770
I think it's pretty good.
Yeah?

326
00:25:39,856 --> 00:25:41,574
Yeah, tell us.
Come on.

327
00:25:41,656 --> 00:25:46,092
All right. Uh, I was working
across the street

328
00:25:46,175 --> 00:25:50,134
and, uh, Ritchie would come
over every break he had

329
00:25:50,255 --> 00:25:52,325
and he would bring me
flowers and candy.

330
00:25:52,415 --> 00:25:54,007
And then it got
really awkward,

331
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:57,206
because I didn't
know who he was.

332
00:25:57,294 --> 00:26:01,685
And I started just making
any excuse I could to say no

333
00:26:01,774 --> 00:26:05,528
and then one day,
out of the blue he walks in

334
00:26:05,614 --> 00:26:08,174
and he tells me
I'm making a big mistake.

335
00:26:10,213 --> 00:26:12,249
And I didn't know
what to say,

336
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:16,246
because he seemed
so convinced.

337
00:26:18,733 --> 00:26:20,325
So I went
out with him.

338
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:22,687
All because he wouldn't
leave you alone?

339
00:26:22,772 --> 00:26:24,524
No.

340
00:26:24,612 --> 00:26:28,207
Because, he knew what
I needed more than I did.

341
00:26:29,612 --> 00:26:31,489
And now look at him.

342
00:26:31,572 --> 00:26:34,723
He goes from dubbing cartoons
to international banking.

343
00:26:36,251 --> 00:26:38,082
It's currency exchange.

344
00:26:38,211 --> 00:26:42,329
Cartoons? Is that what you
call porn these days? Porn?

345
00:26:42,411 --> 00:26:45,926
You're going to have
to excuse Terry as an idiot.

346
00:26:46,011 --> 00:26:47,922
When me and Ritchie
weren't looking

347
00:26:48,011 --> 00:26:50,763
he was using the equipment to
make porn for Adele here.

348
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,886
I don't think there's anything
wrong with it.

349
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:54,926
I mean, a little porn is healthy
now and then.

350
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:56,602
You guys are
all perverts, okay?

351
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:58,487
Hey, look at these.
These are our girls.

352
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:00,328
Ah, look how much
they've grown.

353
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:03,367
That's, um, Anabel,
and that's Betsy.

354
00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:04,717
So beautiful.
Now, Ritchie...

355
00:27:04,809 --> 00:27:06,447
Oh, they're gorgeous.
Yeah.

356
00:27:06,529 --> 00:27:08,520
What's currency exchange?

357
00:27:08,609 --> 00:27:13,080
That's when he watches the market,
like everybody else,

358
00:27:13,209 --> 00:27:15,563
and he looks for trends.
Okay.

359
00:27:15,648 --> 00:27:18,401
Like, um, natural
disaster or typhus,

360
00:27:18,488 --> 00:27:21,002
then he takes
advantage of inflation.

361
00:27:21,088 --> 00:27:23,522
And waits.
Is that right?

362
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:25,599
That's pretty good.
Pretty good.

363
00:27:25,688 --> 00:27:28,155
You got all
the inside information?

364
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:30,442
No. Vendor makes
the decisions.

365
00:27:30,527 --> 00:27:31,755
He's the one
who pays me.

366
00:27:31,847 --> 00:27:33,724
In Valentino suits?

367
00:27:33,807 --> 00:27:35,559
Uh, it's Bloomingdale's.

368
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,359
Hey, this is actually...

369
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:39,597
This is genuine Chinese silk.
It's nice, right?

370
00:27:39,687 --> 00:27:41,005
Did you pick it out for him?

371
00:27:41,086 --> 00:27:43,998
Absolutely not.

372
00:27:44,086 --> 00:27:47,317
It's a nice shirt, Terry.
Shows off your hair.

373
00:27:47,446 --> 00:27:50,119
Thank you. I spent a lot
of money on this shit.

374
00:27:50,206 --> 00:27:51,844
That is pretty awkward.

375
00:27:55,525 --> 00:27:57,436
That was really excellent.
Thanks a lot.

376
00:27:57,565 --> 00:27:59,920
Thank you.
Keep the change.

377
00:28:00,005 --> 00:28:01,882
See us again, sir.

378
00:28:02,045 --> 00:28:05,003
You got dinner?
Yeah, no skin off my nose.

379
00:28:05,085 --> 00:28:07,075
Thank you.
You're welcome.

380
00:28:07,164 --> 00:28:08,961
So what do you think?
About what?

381
00:28:09,044 --> 00:28:10,602
Olivia?

382
00:28:10,684 --> 00:28:12,242
She's all right.

383
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:14,155
What is that supposed
to mean?

384
00:28:14,244 --> 00:28:17,156
Uh, you seem happy enough.
I'm happy for you. Okay.

385
00:28:17,244 --> 00:28:19,633
What do you want me to say?
She ain't my type.

386
00:28:19,724 --> 00:28:21,759
Well, I'm sorry you had
to be seen with us.

387
00:28:21,843 --> 00:28:24,482
What's your problem, Dino?
Forgot already?

388
00:28:24,563 --> 00:28:28,078
You couldn't even talk to a girl
unless I made the first move.

389
00:28:28,163 --> 00:28:29,994
I suppose. You're my best friend,
Ritchie.

390
00:28:30,123 --> 00:28:33,035
That's true. So I just think
about you all the time.

391
00:28:33,123 --> 00:28:35,238
I wonder how you're doing,
how your family is.

392
00:28:35,322 --> 00:28:36,835
You know, I used
to take care of you.

393
00:28:36,922 --> 00:28:38,514
Now I have to call
your wife

394
00:28:38,602 --> 00:28:40,672
every time I want to see you?
Really?

395
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:43,196
I'm doing great.

396
00:28:43,282 --> 00:28:45,318
All right, that's good.
I'm sorry.

397
00:28:45,402 --> 00:28:46,880
Look, I, really,
I'm sorry.

398
00:28:47,001 --> 00:28:48,593
It's just that
I miss you, you know?

399
00:28:48,681 --> 00:28:50,797
It's okay.
Yeah.

400
00:28:50,921 --> 00:28:52,718
Can I have a hug?
Give me a hug.

401
00:28:52,881 --> 00:28:54,792
A hug? Jesus Christ.
Why are you hugging my husband?

402
00:28:54,881 --> 00:28:57,236
My best friend?
Where did Olivia go?

403
00:28:57,321 --> 00:28:58,754
She's in the restroom.

404
00:28:58,881 --> 00:29:00,233
She's all locked in there.
Really?

405
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,308
Try it.

406
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,830
It's the purest shit
you can find.

407
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,796
It's good.
Like I told you.

408
00:29:19,879 --> 00:29:21,676
Same deal
we spoke about?

409
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:26,274
Yeah, unless you want to
give me more money. No.

410
00:29:26,358 --> 00:29:30,033
Here.
We should count it.

411
00:30:00,956 --> 00:30:03,709
Oh! Oh!

412
00:30:03,796 --> 00:30:06,070
Oh.

413
00:30:14,835 --> 00:30:16,314
Oh.

414
00:30:16,395 --> 00:30:18,589
Oh, shit.

415
00:30:18,674 --> 00:30:20,949
Mom? Betsy woke me up.
Son of a bitch.

416
00:30:21,034 --> 00:30:22,945
Uh...
Go back to bed.

417
00:30:23,034 --> 00:30:24,911
She had a bad dream.
This is not fair.

418
00:30:28,234 --> 00:30:29,223
Oh.

419
00:30:30,514 --> 00:30:33,152
Hold on.

420
00:30:37,993 --> 00:30:39,346
Hm.

421
00:30:39,433 --> 00:30:41,867
All right.

422
00:30:41,953 --> 00:30:43,830
What the hell
is going on?

423
00:30:45,472 --> 00:30:46,985
Can I come
in the bed, please?

424
00:30:57,112 --> 00:30:59,671
Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger says

425
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,747
he will ask
Congress for funds.

426
00:31:01,831 --> 00:31:04,186
They're coming
back from Vietnam?

427
00:31:04,271 --> 00:31:05,829
Yeah.

428
00:31:05,911 --> 00:31:08,630
Dad?
What?

429
00:31:08,711 --> 00:31:10,860
Sister Marjorie says
it's God's will.

430
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,702
What's God's will?

431
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:15,588
The people who died in Vietnam.

432
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:17,786
That doesn't really make
sense to me.

433
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:21,829
Well, you know, honey,
there's just too many people in the world

434
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:23,581
for God to care
about everyone.

435
00:31:23,669 --> 00:31:25,739
So that's why we look
after each other.

436
00:31:25,829 --> 00:31:30,584
Yeah, your mom's right.
God's got nothing to do with it.

437
00:31:30,669 --> 00:31:32,500
There's nothing else on?

438
00:31:32,589 --> 00:31:34,386
They got school, Ritchie.
They got school real early.

439
00:31:34,469 --> 00:31:36,187
Mom's the boss.

440
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,418
Can I stay in here with you?

441
00:31:38,508 --> 00:31:40,305
Not tonight.

442
00:31:40,388 --> 00:31:42,458
Come on.
You'll be all right.

443
00:31:42,548 --> 00:31:45,142
Come on, girls.

444
00:31:45,228 --> 00:31:47,458
No more bad dreams.
All right.

445
00:31:47,548 --> 00:31:50,061
All right, goodnight.
Love you.

446
00:31:50,147 --> 00:31:52,217
Love you. Just count sheep.
That's what I do.

447
00:31:52,307 --> 00:31:54,059
I'll try it.

448
00:31:59,347 --> 00:32:02,578
You're the one who wanted to
send them to Catholic school.

449
00:32:02,666 --> 00:32:06,136
I was an altar boy.

450
00:32:06,226 --> 00:32:09,138
Oh, yeah.
Come here.

451
00:32:44,143 --> 00:32:45,895
Hey, Jimmy.

452
00:32:45,983 --> 00:32:47,257
Hey, Josh.

453
00:32:49,223 --> 00:32:50,702
Who's up there?

454
00:32:50,783 --> 00:32:52,933
The Gambino guy,
Leo Marks.

455
00:32:53,063 --> 00:32:54,052
Leo?

456
00:32:54,143 --> 00:32:55,177
Yeah.

457
00:32:58,222 --> 00:33:00,690
You know something, Leo?

458
00:33:00,782 --> 00:33:04,331
One of these days I'm not going
to let you in here anymore.

459
00:33:04,422 --> 00:33:10,257
I'm starting to associate your
face with bad news. Salud.

460
00:33:10,341 --> 00:33:14,573
I got where I am by doing
what's right, Roy. Salud.

461
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:18,256
Oh, yeah?
Is that how it works?

462
00:33:18,341 --> 00:33:20,650
You know, I'm the one
delivering the message.

463
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,969
Not receiving it.

464
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:28,768
All right, well,
what's the message?

465
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:31,169
Rosenthal steals
half a mil in cocaine,

466
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,852
then shoots
the couriers.

467
00:33:34,939 --> 00:33:36,338
You're being
held responsible

468
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:38,330
by the Cubans
for his actions.

469
00:33:38,419 --> 00:33:40,649
How do you figure that?
How the fuck am I responsible?

470
00:33:40,739 --> 00:33:45,688
He goes around throwing your name.
Demeo this, Demeo that.

471
00:33:45,819 --> 00:33:48,127
Starts a war, so now everyone
thinks you're involved.

472
00:33:48,218 --> 00:33:50,368
He was just trying
to help me out, Leo!

473
00:33:50,458 --> 00:33:54,133
Help you out?
Ha!

474
00:33:54,218 --> 00:33:58,370
Then it's your fault you made
him feel sorry for you.

475
00:33:58,498 --> 00:34:00,295
You want to be friends
with the Gambinos,

476
00:34:00,418 --> 00:34:02,806
then be real with me.

477
00:34:02,897 --> 00:34:07,607
I understand you got this relationship
with Rosenthal.

478
00:34:07,697 --> 00:34:10,052
But the couriers he killed
and stole from,

479
00:34:10,177 --> 00:34:13,328
they were linked
to the Callies, Roy.

480
00:34:13,417 --> 00:34:15,805
Nothing gets forgotten.

481
00:34:15,896 --> 00:34:19,650
Leo, you're asking me
to kill Rosenthal?

482
00:34:19,736 --> 00:34:22,409
Why don't you stop asking questions
you know the answers to?

483
00:34:22,496 --> 00:34:24,327
I took the kid
from the streets!

484
00:34:24,416 --> 00:34:26,327
I raised him like he was
one of my own.

485
00:34:26,416 --> 00:34:28,087
Then that's
your problem.

486
00:34:28,175 --> 00:34:30,689
Kid goes around telling
everybody he's your son

487
00:34:30,775 --> 00:34:32,447
and they hold the...
the father accountable.

488
00:34:32,535 --> 00:34:34,412
They were fucking coked out
delivery boys!

489
00:34:34,575 --> 00:34:36,213
Who gives a fuck?
Who gives a shit about them?

490
00:34:36,295 --> 00:34:38,331
But that's
not the point.

491
00:34:38,415 --> 00:34:41,087
You understand? They'll come
after you and him no matter what.

492
00:34:41,214 --> 00:34:44,650
Do you fucking understand that in
your fucking thick head? Yes! Fuck me.

493
00:34:44,774 --> 00:34:48,528
You get what I'm telling you?
Yeah, I get it.

494
00:34:48,614 --> 00:34:52,289
Even people you consider friends
will come after him.

495
00:34:52,374 --> 00:34:54,250
You got
that friend, Marty.

496
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:56,528
What about Marty?

497
00:34:56,613 --> 00:34:58,365
He already started spreading
the word where to find him.

498
00:34:58,453 --> 00:35:01,445
This is one big fucking mess
we don't need, Roy.

499
00:35:03,253 --> 00:35:05,209
Clean it up.

500
00:35:08,012 --> 00:35:11,482
The property is in Vernon and he's
asking Atlantic City price.

501
00:35:11,572 --> 00:35:13,688
Dad, we got to go.

502
00:35:13,772 --> 00:35:15,205
Gambling is going
legal any day.

503
00:35:15,292 --> 00:35:17,169
They're condominiums,
not a casino.

504
00:35:17,252 --> 00:35:19,128
You got to understand,
it's a seller's market.

505
00:35:19,211 --> 00:35:21,122
With the rumors of
gambling going legal,

506
00:35:21,211 --> 00:35:23,088
property values are going
through the roof.

507
00:35:23,171 --> 00:35:25,605
Tell them I'm not going
above 150, all right?

508
00:35:25,691 --> 00:35:27,363
You're changing
your tie.

509
00:35:27,451 --> 00:35:29,089
He won't give me the time of day.

510
00:35:29,171 --> 00:35:30,684
I'll have to call you back later.

511
00:35:30,771 --> 00:35:32,761
All right.
Take care.

512
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:35,318
Hey, I'm going shopping.
Need anything?

513
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:37,162
More cologne?

514
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:39,599
What, again?
Yeah.

515
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:41,726
You got a girlfriend
I don't know about?

516
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:43,607
No, it's for you, baby.
Mom.

517
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:45,441
Have a great day
at school, sweetie.

518
00:35:45,529 --> 00:35:47,167
All right, bye.
Bye.

519
00:35:48,329 --> 00:35:50,047
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

520
00:35:50,129 --> 00:35:51,448
Look at that.

521
00:35:51,529 --> 00:35:54,168
Let's go, Bets!

522
00:35:57,929 --> 00:35:59,566
Don't take any crap
from any nuns.

523
00:35:59,648 --> 00:36:01,001
Okay, I won't.
Coming.

524
00:36:01,088 --> 00:36:02,157
Come here.
Bye.

525
00:36:02,248 --> 00:36:03,522
Love you.
Love you.

526
00:36:03,608 --> 00:36:04,677
Love you, too.
All right.

527
00:36:04,768 --> 00:36:05,803
See you after school.

528
00:36:41,325 --> 00:36:44,283
There's no sound on this,
but tell me your name.

529
00:36:44,365 --> 00:36:46,276
Alex.
Alex.

530
00:36:46,405 --> 00:36:50,114
Very nice to meet you, Alex.
I'm Marty.

531
00:36:50,205 --> 00:36:52,923
Very nice.

532
00:36:53,004 --> 00:36:55,472
Ah, look at that.
Bare your soul.

533
00:36:55,564 --> 00:36:57,953
Okay, you like that?

534
00:36:58,044 --> 00:36:59,033
I like that.

535
00:37:30,161 --> 00:37:32,117
No! No!

536
00:37:32,201 --> 00:37:34,715
Yes, he asked me
about Rosenthal,

537
00:37:34,801 --> 00:37:36,359
if I'd seen
him lately

538
00:37:36,441 --> 00:37:41,515
and I said not in a while!
That's all.

539
00:37:41,601 --> 00:37:44,717
That's... yes, that's all.

540
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,677
Of course, yes.

541
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,310
I swear to God. Yes.

542
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:00,189
As soon as possible.

543
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:02,315
Thank you, Roy.

544
00:38:02,399 --> 00:38:03,468
He wants to talk to you.

545
00:38:07,879 --> 00:38:09,948
Yeah?

546
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:13,155
Right.

547
00:38:13,238 --> 00:38:16,628
Ah. Guess everyone has
a soft spot, right?

548
00:38:16,718 --> 00:38:18,197
Guess so.

549
00:38:18,278 --> 00:38:20,633
Hey, what the fuck's going on?

550
00:38:20,718 --> 00:38:21,867
He changed his mind.

551
00:38:21,958 --> 00:38:23,788
No, no, no, no.
Look,

552
00:38:23,877 --> 00:38:26,869
Rosenthal's my best friend.
I would never say anything.

553
00:38:26,997 --> 00:38:28,476
Not my problem.

554
00:38:28,557 --> 00:38:30,388
Well, do... no! No! Not...
Please don't!

555
00:38:30,477 --> 00:38:33,389
God, please!
God, please!

556
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,308
What, are you praying?

557
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:38,194
God, please! Please!

558
00:38:38,276 --> 00:38:39,914
You really believe that?

559
00:38:39,996 --> 00:38:41,952
You think God will come
down and save you?

560
00:38:46,156 --> 00:38:51,024
All right.
I'll give you some time.

561
00:38:51,115 --> 00:38:53,345
Pray to God.

562
00:38:53,435 --> 00:38:54,948
Tell him to come
down and stop me.

563
00:39:01,035 --> 00:39:02,228
Go ahead.

564
00:39:17,353 --> 00:39:18,468
Our Father...

565
00:39:18,553 --> 00:39:22,387
Our Father...
Mm-hm.

566
00:39:22,473 --> 00:39:25,067
All right, then.

567
00:39:25,153 --> 00:39:29,589
All right, all right, all right.

568
00:39:29,672 --> 00:39:32,744
I'm not
feeling nothing.

569
00:39:35,392 --> 00:39:36,791
Nothing at all.

570
00:39:42,511 --> 00:39:44,547
Harder.

571
00:39:44,631 --> 00:39:46,622
What? I'm...

572
00:39:46,711 --> 00:39:48,542
This your last chance.

573
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:05,744
No. No. Don't.

574
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:11,867
I think God's busy.

575
00:40:48,706 --> 00:40:53,382
Please... please,
I didn't see anything.

576
00:40:53,506 --> 00:40:55,258
I'm not Shannon.
I'm Alex.

577
00:40:55,346 --> 00:40:57,018
She's his girl usually.
I don't know him. I...

578
00:40:57,106 --> 00:40:58,585
Doesn't fucking matter!

579
00:41:01,345 --> 00:41:03,017
I promise
I won't say anything.

580
00:41:03,105 --> 00:41:07,974
Shh. How old are you?

581
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:09,578
Seventeen.

582
00:41:09,665 --> 00:41:13,816
Get out. Come on.
Come on. Get dressed.

583
00:41:17,064 --> 00:41:18,577
Come on.

584
00:41:23,904 --> 00:41:24,939
Better hurry up.

585
00:41:30,503 --> 00:41:31,492
Come on.

586
00:41:33,943 --> 00:41:35,012
Just get out of here.

587
00:41:37,503 --> 00:41:39,572
Hey, Polack.
What?

588
00:41:39,662 --> 00:41:42,893
Let's take a ride.
Why?

589
00:41:42,982 --> 00:41:46,099
Suit yourself.

590
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:56,252
What the hell
are you up to?

591
00:41:56,341 --> 00:41:57,694
Guess the man didn't
want to take any chances,

592
00:41:57,781 --> 00:42:00,056
putting us both
on the same mark.

593
00:42:00,141 --> 00:42:03,133
Kuklinski, right?
Yeah.

594
00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:08,419
Robert Pronge.
Introductions are long overdue.

595
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,019
Who's the girl?
I don't know her.

596
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,533
And you let her go?

597
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:13,810
I don't kill
women or children.

598
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,128
You're going to kill
your reputation.

599
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,573
What are you doing?

600
00:42:18,659 --> 00:42:20,650
She saw my face.

601
00:42:26,939 --> 00:42:28,338
Stop the car.

602
00:42:29,899 --> 00:42:31,536
Stop the car now.

603
00:42:31,618 --> 00:42:33,210
The odds are against you.

604
00:42:33,298 --> 00:42:34,492
You shoot the captain,
the ship goes down.

605
00:42:36,138 --> 00:42:37,253
Stop the fucking car!

606
00:42:43,938 --> 00:42:46,656
Aw, what the fuck
is the matter with you?

607
00:42:48,297 --> 00:42:50,765
Christ! Are you
fucking nuts?

608
00:42:50,857 --> 00:42:52,973
Got to keep
my reputation.

609
00:42:53,057 --> 00:42:54,888
You owe me a window,
Polack.

610
00:42:54,977 --> 00:42:56,535
Yeah, I'll pay you back
someday.

611
00:42:58,896 --> 00:43:01,171
You want to get the
fuck out of the way?

612
00:43:07,856 --> 00:43:10,733
Stupid motherfucker.

613
00:43:22,575 --> 00:43:24,166
Vegetables are good
for you.

614
00:43:24,254 --> 00:43:26,927
Didn't your mom
ever tell you that?

615
00:43:27,014 --> 00:43:28,845
No.

616
00:43:28,934 --> 00:43:33,291
No? What about leaving
witnesses at a murder scene?

617
00:43:33,374 --> 00:43:36,843
She forget to tell you
that one, too?

618
00:43:36,933 --> 00:43:40,846
I guess she didn't
give me much advice.

619
00:43:40,933 --> 00:43:43,447
She was a kid, Roy.

620
00:43:43,533 --> 00:43:45,603
That's right.

621
00:43:45,693 --> 00:43:48,207
Young girls are notorious for keeping
their fucking mouths shut.

622
00:43:48,333 --> 00:43:50,243
She doesn't even know me.
They got nothing' on me.

623
00:43:50,332 --> 00:43:51,811
Can I do something?
No.

624
00:43:51,892 --> 00:43:52,881
Jimmy.

625
00:43:57,092 --> 00:44:00,721
Thing is? I told you
to zip it the fuck up.

626
00:44:00,852 --> 00:44:03,570
I did. I'm getting
paranoid, Polack.

627
00:44:03,651 --> 00:44:05,687
And it's all because he
wanted to help me out.

628
00:44:05,771 --> 00:44:07,489
The Gambinos
want to hurt me.

629
00:44:07,571 --> 00:44:10,369
The Callies want my whole
fucking family dead.

630
00:44:10,451 --> 00:44:12,840
The other day, there's a car
that I don't recognize,

631
00:44:12,931 --> 00:44:14,683
it's parked
outside of my house.

632
00:44:14,771 --> 00:44:16,328
Looked Cuban enough,
piece of shit car,

633
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:18,002
dark skin,
I think one thing.

634
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:20,081
So I panic.

635
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:21,762
Turns out it's a fucking
Puerto Rican kid

636
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:23,761
selling vacuum cleaners

637
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:28,162
to help pay his way through college.
You get it now?

638
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:31,082
I'm not going to do a thing
until this is resolved.

639
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:33,683
For now,
you're decommissioned.

640
00:44:33,769 --> 00:44:38,968
We all got to make sacrifices
to stay alive.

641
00:44:39,089 --> 00:44:41,239
I need to work, Roy.
I'm good at what I do.

642
00:44:41,329 --> 00:44:42,886
If that were true,
then I wouldn't have

643
00:44:43,008 --> 00:44:45,283
any fucking loose ends,
now, would I?

644
00:44:45,368 --> 00:44:48,724
Nothing is done in my name
until we figure this out. Nothing.

645
00:44:48,848 --> 00:44:50,042
Let me do something
on the side.

646
00:44:50,128 --> 00:44:52,722
Not a fucking thing.

647
00:44:52,808 --> 00:44:54,924
Roy...
No. Nothing.

648
00:44:57,367 --> 00:44:59,198
Tell me
that you understand.

649
00:44:59,287 --> 00:45:02,836
I brought you into this,
and now I'm letting you go.

650
00:45:02,927 --> 00:45:04,246
I don't fucking
hear you, Polack.

651
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:05,646
I understand.

652
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:17,841
Here's some money
to hold you over.

653
00:45:17,926 --> 00:45:19,962
Josh, let's get
the fuck out of here.

654
00:45:37,044 --> 00:45:38,033
What?

655
00:45:40,244 --> 00:45:42,394
Hello?

656
00:45:42,524 --> 00:45:44,719
This is a call
from Hudson County Jail.

657
00:45:44,804 --> 00:45:46,954
If you'd like to take the call,
please remain on the line.

658
00:45:53,363 --> 00:45:54,796
Who was that?

659
00:46:18,001 --> 00:46:19,320
There you go.

660
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:21,995
Thanks.

661
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,359
Ritchie.

662
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,359
What is it,
almost 11 years?

663
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:35,750
How are you doing, Joey?

664
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:39,515
You're looking
at it.

665
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:43,194
I've got bed bugs.

666
00:46:43,279 --> 00:46:45,588
You got big.

667
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:47,874
Yeah.

668
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:54,595
Probably more pissed
I killed that dog than the girl, huh?

669
00:46:57,358 --> 00:46:59,508
She was 12 years old.

670
00:46:59,598 --> 00:47:04,956
Wasn't my fault.
She started screaming.

671
00:47:05,038 --> 00:47:08,393
After all these years,
you got someplace to go?

672
00:47:08,517 --> 00:47:10,508
Yeah, I told my kids I'd
take them roller skating.

673
00:47:10,597 --> 00:47:14,351
You're a family man now?

674
00:47:14,437 --> 00:47:16,155
That makes me an uncle?

675
00:47:16,277 --> 00:47:17,630
What, girls, boys, what?

676
00:47:17,717 --> 00:47:19,116
Two daughters.

677
00:47:19,237 --> 00:47:21,955
What are their names?

678
00:47:22,036 --> 00:47:25,233
Anabel and Betsy.

679
00:47:25,316 --> 00:47:27,671
Come on.

680
00:47:27,756 --> 00:47:30,190
You and me, Ritchie, we're too fucked
in the head for family.

681
00:47:30,276 --> 00:47:31,425
You know that.

682
00:47:31,516 --> 00:47:34,632
Speak for yourself.

683
00:47:34,715 --> 00:47:36,273
Think you're different
than me, huh?

684
00:47:36,355 --> 00:47:38,823
I don't have to think about it.

685
00:47:38,915 --> 00:47:40,712
Oh, yeah?

686
00:47:40,795 --> 00:47:42,513
What about
those stray dogs?

687
00:47:42,635 --> 00:47:44,512
The ones you tied
to the express train?

688
00:47:44,635 --> 00:47:46,704
You going to tell that story
to your daughters?

689
00:47:46,794 --> 00:47:51,822
What about that boy?
What was his name, uh, Frank?

690
00:47:51,914 --> 00:47:54,951
You caved his head in with
that shower pole. Remember?

691
00:47:55,034 --> 00:47:58,821
Yeah, I saw you doing it, but I didn't
say nothing 'cause I'm your brother.

692
00:47:58,913 --> 00:48:00,949
I don't want you to call
the house anymore.

693
00:48:01,033 --> 00:48:03,388
Why?

694
00:48:03,473 --> 00:48:06,545
Because I don't want to have to
explain to people who you are.

695
00:48:12,192 --> 00:48:15,184
What if I do, huh?

696
00:48:15,272 --> 00:48:16,671
What if I want
to be an uncle?

697
00:48:16,752 --> 00:48:18,504
U ncle Joey?

698
00:48:18,592 --> 00:48:20,947
Hey! I'm sorry,
all right?

699
00:48:21,032 --> 00:48:23,102
Hey, Ritchie, please.
I need you.

700
00:48:23,192 --> 00:48:25,580
I need your help.
Come back.

701
00:48:32,831 --> 00:48:37,427
The old man used to count them
out in Polish, remember?

702
00:48:37,511 --> 00:48:43,460
Every punch he landed,
you counted, too.

703
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:45,745
He got so pissed,
he forgot about me.

704
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:47,661
What do you need, Joey?

705
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:50,105
A lawyer.

706
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:52,225
There's a guy in Trenton,
he said he'd take me on.

707
00:48:52,309 --> 00:48:53,947
He wants
ten grand to start.

708
00:48:54,029 --> 00:48:55,667
I don't have that kind of cash.

709
00:48:55,749 --> 00:48:57,740
Well, do you know
anybody that does?

710
00:48:57,869 --> 00:49:00,258
Joey, look, it don't matter.
You killed a little girl.

711
00:49:00,349 --> 00:49:02,544
Nobody's going to forgive
you, okay?

712
00:49:02,629 --> 00:49:07,224
Yeah, I know I did.
I know.

713
00:49:11,828 --> 00:49:13,102
A wife?

714
00:49:13,188 --> 00:49:14,587
Fucking kids?

715
00:49:14,668 --> 00:49:16,863
Who are you kidding?

716
00:49:16,948 --> 00:49:19,302
You're going to end up
just like me, right here.

717
00:49:19,387 --> 00:49:21,423
So go fuck you
and your fucking family.

718
00:49:21,507 --> 00:49:22,701
Take care.

719
00:49:22,787 --> 00:49:24,539
Hey! Where you going?

720
00:49:24,667 --> 00:49:26,623
I can't stand it!
Richard!

721
00:49:26,707 --> 00:49:29,346
Don't leave me again,
you motherfucker!

722
00:49:29,427 --> 00:49:31,098
Goddamn! You fuck!

723
00:49:31,186 --> 00:49:33,381
Get the fuck off me!

724
00:49:33,466 --> 00:49:36,663
Fuck you!
Son of a bitch!

725
00:49:43,425 --> 00:49:44,824
Hey, Daddy.

726
00:49:49,865 --> 00:49:52,095
Hi, Mom!
Hi! You're doing great, girls.

727
00:49:52,185 --> 00:49:53,220
Hey, girls.

728
00:49:56,025 --> 00:49:59,016
What's going
on with Ritchie?

729
00:49:59,104 --> 00:50:01,015
I see he got
the day off again.

730
00:50:01,104 --> 00:50:04,255
Yeah, off,
I don't know about off.

731
00:50:04,344 --> 00:50:07,381
He seems to be making his
own schedule these days.

732
00:50:07,464 --> 00:50:09,182
You know what I mean?

733
00:50:09,264 --> 00:50:11,902
You know, you can ask him
what's going on, Deb.

734
00:50:11,983 --> 00:50:14,895
You're his wife.
It's got to be a work issue.

735
00:50:15,023 --> 00:50:16,854
And if it is?

736
00:50:16,983 --> 00:50:19,497
If your husband's been laid off,
it's your business.

737
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:21,335
You're the one holding
down the house.

738
00:50:21,423 --> 00:50:24,095
That's all I'm saying.

739
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:33,531
So much fun.

740
00:50:36,901 --> 00:50:39,540
You looked great.
Thank you.

741
00:50:39,621 --> 00:50:41,179
You look great, too.
Thanks.

742
00:50:41,261 --> 00:50:42,660
So much fun.

743
00:50:48,421 --> 00:50:51,093
Christ!
You all right?

744
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:52,977
Yeah. You okay honey?

745
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:54,818
Yeah.

746
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:57,095
You didn't hit
your head?

747
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:59,011
Hey! You going to get on out
and take a look at it?

748
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,375
Why don't you just
get back in your car?

749
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:02,892
Hey, fuck you, lady!

750
00:51:02,979 --> 00:51:04,651
Oh, Ritchie.
Ritchie!

751
00:51:04,779 --> 00:51:07,009
All right, all right,
all right, sorry, sorry!

752
00:51:07,099 --> 00:51:08,293
Hey, you hit my car!

753
00:51:08,379 --> 00:51:09,698
Get in
your fucking car.

754
00:51:09,779 --> 00:51:10,768
Peace, man.

755
00:51:16,738 --> 00:51:18,376
Son of a bitch.

756
00:51:18,498 --> 00:51:21,092
You know what? Fuck you!
And fuck your family!

757
00:51:24,698 --> 00:51:27,007
Ritchie! Ritchie!

758
00:51:28,977 --> 00:51:31,775
Stop the car!

759
00:51:31,857 --> 00:51:33,893
What are you doing?
Stop!

760
00:51:36,057 --> 00:51:37,854
Stop the car!

761
00:51:39,777 --> 00:51:41,051
Dad!

762
00:51:44,456 --> 00:51:48,244
Daddy, stop it!
Stop!

763
00:51:48,336 --> 00:51:51,328
Dad, stop the car!

764
00:51:53,416 --> 00:51:55,167
Dad!

765
00:51:57,535 --> 00:52:00,333
Dad, stop, please!
Daddy! Please!

766
00:52:02,655 --> 00:52:04,691
Just, just stop the car!

767
00:52:04,775 --> 00:52:06,333
Daddy, stop it!
Dad, stop!

768
00:52:08,174 --> 00:52:10,813
Stop the car! Dad!

769
00:52:18,094 --> 00:52:19,846
What is wrong with you?

770
00:52:19,974 --> 00:52:21,850
I'm sorry.

771
00:52:21,973 --> 00:52:24,487
Are you okay?
She's okay.

772
00:52:24,573 --> 00:52:27,007
She's okay.

773
00:53:09,570 --> 00:53:13,039
The Golden Nugget
in Atlantic City.

774
00:53:13,129 --> 00:53:15,848
You really have
to see it to believe it.

775
00:53:20,609 --> 00:53:23,248
What are you doing up?

776
00:53:23,329 --> 00:53:25,081
Can't sleep.

777
00:53:28,448 --> 00:53:29,881
Anything on?

778
00:53:29,968 --> 00:53:32,084
Not really.

779
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:47,197
What's going on,
Ritchie?

780
00:53:47,287 --> 00:53:49,517
Please, talk to me.

781
00:53:49,607 --> 00:53:53,599
I'm all right.

782
00:53:53,726 --> 00:53:57,162
That's it?

783
00:53:57,246 --> 00:54:01,080
The condo prices
in AC skyrocketed.

784
00:54:01,166 --> 00:54:03,919
You know that's not
what I'm talking about.

785
00:54:04,006 --> 00:54:06,917
I just lost my temper.
So, what?

786
00:54:07,005 --> 00:54:11,920
Yeah. Yeah. That's been
happening a lot lately.

787
00:54:12,005 --> 00:54:13,882
The guy told you
to go fuck yourself.

788
00:54:13,965 --> 00:54:15,318
You think I'm going
to take that?

789
00:54:15,405 --> 00:54:17,396
So you put
everyone at risk?

790
00:54:17,485 --> 00:54:20,556
That's...

791
00:54:20,644 --> 00:54:22,874
that's not what
I meant to do.

792
00:54:23,004 --> 00:54:25,279
I said, "I'm sorry. "

793
00:54:25,364 --> 00:54:27,116
I don't want to talk
about it anymore.

794
00:54:27,204 --> 00:54:32,402
Ritchie, you-you-you
got to just talk to me.

795
00:54:32,483 --> 00:54:34,075
Got to tell me.

796
00:54:34,163 --> 00:54:38,759
You and me, we've been
through enough.

797
00:54:38,843 --> 00:54:40,913
We got too much
good here

798
00:54:41,003 --> 00:54:43,563
for you to be acting
this way.

799
00:54:43,683 --> 00:54:46,321
What way?
Like you don't care anymore.

800
00:54:49,842 --> 00:54:53,118
So that's what you think?
I don't care anymore?

801
00:54:53,202 --> 00:54:56,239
I see. I don't get
the benefit of the doubt?

802
00:54:56,322 --> 00:54:58,198
Really?
Of course, you do.

803
00:54:58,281 --> 00:55:00,511
I buy you all this shit,
I buy you this fucking house?

804
00:55:00,601 --> 00:55:02,159
I buy you
your fucking jewelry.

805
00:55:02,241 --> 00:55:04,232
I send the girls
to private school!

806
00:55:04,321 --> 00:55:06,152
Do not raise your voice
to me, Richard.

807
00:55:06,281 --> 00:55:09,353
"Richard?" What happened to "Ritchie?"
I don't know.

808
00:55:09,441 --> 00:55:11,396
Yeah? Well, fuck you!

809
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,436
I don't give a shit what you
fucking think about anything!

810
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,719
Fuck!

811
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,395
Oh, Richard!

812
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,947
Richard!

813
00:55:27,039 --> 00:55:28,677
I'm so sorry.

814
00:55:34,719 --> 00:55:36,834
Please. I'm so sorry.
Deb...

815
00:55:41,718 --> 00:55:44,186
This is it, okay?

816
00:55:44,278 --> 00:55:48,749
You and the girls.

817
00:55:48,838 --> 00:55:52,955
That is all I care about
in the whole fucking world.

818
00:55:53,037 --> 00:55:55,107
Do you understand me?
Yeah.

819
00:55:55,197 --> 00:55:56,755
That's it.

820
00:55:56,837 --> 00:56:01,627
I know. I know.
I do. I know. I know.

821
00:56:01,717 --> 00:56:06,836
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

822
00:56:06,916 --> 00:56:07,985
I'm so sorry.

823
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:32,182
There you go.
Thank you.

824
00:56:35,074 --> 00:56:38,191
All right, kids, that's it.
Go on home. We're closed.

825
00:56:38,274 --> 00:56:39,992
No, wait.
Please, Mr. Freezy.

826
00:56:40,074 --> 00:56:42,144
My little brother wants
a strawberry shortcake.

827
00:56:42,234 --> 00:56:43,985
My mom gave us three dollars.
Is that enough?

828
00:56:44,073 --> 00:56:45,426
Yeah, it's on the house.
Get out of here.

829
00:56:45,513 --> 00:56:46,548
Thank you.

830
00:56:52,953 --> 00:56:55,671
So, is it my lucky day,
or my last?

831
00:56:55,752 --> 00:56:56,741
You got a second?

832
00:57:01,792 --> 00:57:03,350
So who do you work for?

833
00:57:03,432 --> 00:57:05,150
I work for everyone.

834
00:57:05,232 --> 00:57:09,110
Gambinos, Luchezis,
Pananos, you name it.

835
00:57:09,191 --> 00:57:11,500
What about you?
Red with the arrow through the eye?

836
00:57:11,591 --> 00:57:13,183
That was you, wasn't it?

837
00:57:13,271 --> 00:57:14,670
That's fucking legendary.

838
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:16,628
Was that
target practice?

839
00:57:16,711 --> 00:57:18,144
Somebody wants
somebody dead,

840
00:57:18,231 --> 00:57:19,459
who am I
to question it?

841
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:26,625
Yeah. Remember her?
The cutie you let slide?

842
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:28,587
Force-fed her
a puffer fish.

843
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:31,742
Been frozen since the last
time I saw you.

844
00:57:31,830 --> 00:57:34,264
Three more months
I'll dump her up in Pittsburgh.

845
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:38,746
There's a crack out there, sold his meds,
started torching bodies.

846
00:57:38,829 --> 00:57:42,219
I'll do the same to her.
Pin it on that crazy fucker.

847
00:57:42,309 --> 00:57:44,743
Roy put you up to that?

848
00:57:44,829 --> 00:57:48,707
You know he did. Hm.
Let me show you something.

849
00:57:48,788 --> 00:57:51,586
Coroners are lazier
than cops.

850
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:53,420
If it looks like
a heart attack, it is.

851
00:57:53,508 --> 00:57:56,181
Arsenic?
Pure cyanide.

852
00:57:56,268 --> 00:58:01,136
Careful. It's rare.
Pricey. Comes as a powder.

853
00:58:01,227 --> 00:58:02,706
You can liquefy it,

854
00:58:02,787 --> 00:58:04,982
spray it, bake it
in a fucking cake.

855
00:58:05,067 --> 00:58:08,776
Pour it in a guy's shirt, he's dead
before you can say I'm sorry.

856
00:58:08,867 --> 00:58:11,381
No more stake outs.
I can do that anywhere.

857
00:58:11,507 --> 00:58:15,465
I don't have any friends,
so it makes it easy.

858
00:58:15,546 --> 00:58:18,618
I only feel alone
around other people.

859
00:58:18,706 --> 00:58:20,219
Couldn't be truer.

860
00:58:20,346 --> 00:58:22,064
You got a family?

861
00:58:22,146 --> 00:58:26,378
My son's a decent kid,
despite his cunt mother.

862
00:58:26,466 --> 00:58:30,094
Well, here's
my situation.

863
00:58:30,185 --> 00:58:33,177
I'm currently unemployable.

864
00:58:33,265 --> 00:58:36,098
Except maybe by the rat
who turned me in.

865
00:58:38,665 --> 00:58:41,417
Look, Polack,
I'm good at my job.

866
00:58:41,504 --> 00:58:42,823
Just because
you fucked up

867
00:58:42,904 --> 00:58:44,223
doesn't mean
I owe you shit.

868
00:58:44,304 --> 00:58:46,022
I'll make it
worth your while.

869
00:58:46,104 --> 00:58:48,857
You take care of the details,
I do the hit.

870
00:58:48,944 --> 00:58:53,255
No risk.
We split it 50-50.

871
00:58:53,343 --> 00:58:55,220
You trying to be
my partner?

872
00:58:55,303 --> 00:58:59,615
No. This is short term.

873
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:03,457
Roy's got to think
I'm retired.

874
00:59:03,543 --> 00:59:05,374
You're Polish, I'm Dutch Irish.

875
00:59:05,463 --> 00:59:07,214
We're not exactly
membership material.

876
00:59:07,302 --> 00:59:08,815
We might as well look
out for each other. Mm-hm.

877
00:59:27,821 --> 00:59:29,334
Going to need
more shelves.

878
00:59:31,581 --> 00:59:33,252
Mr. Kuklinski,

879
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:34,773
it's good to see
you all again.

880
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:36,339
Good to see
you, George.

881
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:38,690
My, your ladies
look radiant tonight.

882
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:39,929
Don't they always?

883
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:42,773
Indeed. Your table.

884
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:44,088
Thanks, George.

885
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:45,613
My pleasure, sir.

886
00:59:45,699 --> 00:59:47,849
June 2nd, 1979?

887
00:59:47,939 --> 00:59:49,691
Fuck, does it feel
like two years

888
00:59:49,779 --> 00:59:52,418
since we laid
this fucking steak?

889
00:59:52,499 --> 00:59:54,251
I don't remember.

890
00:59:54,339 --> 00:59:56,295
Going to take a while
to defrost.

891
00:59:56,379 --> 00:59:57,858
Nah, 24 hours
they'll be good.

892
00:59:59,978 --> 01:00:01,855
So I went
into your office

893
01:00:01,938 --> 01:00:03,929
to get your jacket
to take to the cleaners

894
01:00:04,018 --> 01:00:06,657
and there was a lot of money
in that pocket.

895
01:00:10,218 --> 01:00:14,768
I sold high
on 300,000 francs.

896
01:00:14,857 --> 01:00:17,325
That's about
thirty grand.

897
01:00:17,417 --> 01:00:18,975
Thirty grand?
Mm-hm.

898
01:00:19,057 --> 01:00:20,092
Wow.

899
01:00:22,657 --> 01:00:26,444
I'm really proud of you,
Ritchie. I really am. Hm.

900
01:00:36,136 --> 01:00:38,569
Hey.
Hey.

901
01:00:38,655 --> 01:00:41,613
Hey, Roy.
How are you doing, Leo?

902
01:00:43,855 --> 01:00:46,210
Have a seat, Josh.

903
01:00:46,295 --> 01:00:49,571
Yeah, yeah,
what's going on?

904
01:01:03,094 --> 01:01:05,766
Roy?

905
01:01:05,853 --> 01:01:08,048
You can't, Roy.
You, you can't.

906
01:01:08,133 --> 01:01:10,408
Wait, wait, Roy.
Come on, now.

907
01:01:10,493 --> 01:01:12,404
Listen, listen. I'll, I'll,
I'll disappear, okay?

908
01:01:12,493 --> 01:01:14,768
No one will ever hear
from me.

909
01:01:14,853 --> 01:01:18,049
Roy, Roy, hold- hold- hold, fuck!
Roy. No, you can't. Sorry, Josh.

910
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:19,770
Oh!

911
01:01:19,852 --> 01:01:21,683
I can't! I can't!

912
01:01:21,772 --> 01:01:24,161
What the fuck are you doing here,
for Christ's sake?

913
01:01:24,292 --> 01:01:26,852
All right, all right, all right!
Stop! Just stop! Get off!

914
01:01:26,932 --> 01:01:29,082
Get the fuck off me!

915
01:01:29,172 --> 01:01:31,605
Just get... You don't fucking touch me,
you fucking son of a bitch!

916
01:01:31,731 --> 01:01:33,767
Will you leave?
Just go! It's done.

917
01:01:37,171 --> 01:01:39,241
Just fucking go.

918
01:01:39,331 --> 01:01:41,686
You're done.
You're a dead man, Scicoli.

919
01:02:41,446 --> 01:02:43,323
It's got to look
like a natural death.

920
01:02:43,406 --> 01:02:45,078
Like he choked
on a steak,

921
01:02:45,166 --> 01:02:48,044
or had a heart attack,
something like that.

922
01:02:48,126 --> 01:02:50,639
I want to be able to go
to the funeral,

923
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:52,795
give my condolences
to Roy.

924
01:02:52,885 --> 01:02:54,443
Cry like
an old grandmother

925
01:02:54,525 --> 01:02:56,004
and not have my conscience
bother me.

926
01:02:56,085 --> 01:02:57,484
You get
what I'm saying.

927
01:02:57,565 --> 01:02:58,964
Yeah, I got it.

928
01:02:59,045 --> 01:03:00,842
I'll give you
40 grand.

929
01:03:00,925 --> 01:03:02,880
And if there's no suspicion at all,

930
01:03:02,964 --> 01:03:05,080
and I mean at all,

931
01:03:05,164 --> 01:03:07,519
I'll throw in another ten
as a holiday bonus.

932
01:03:09,964 --> 01:03:12,842
You can finish
jerking off.

933
01:03:16,803 --> 01:03:18,521
Cheer up, Polack.

934
01:03:18,603 --> 01:03:20,355
You look like you
don't want to be here.

935
01:03:20,443 --> 01:03:22,399
If I didn't have to leave the house,
I wouldn't.

936
01:03:23,803 --> 01:03:26,192
You sure Leo said 40?
Yeah.

937
01:03:26,283 --> 01:03:29,672
With an extra ten if it looks like
natural causes.

938
01:03:29,762 --> 01:03:31,275
We use cyanide?
Yeah.

939
01:03:31,362 --> 01:03:33,557
Use those new spray
bottles I got.

940
01:03:33,642 --> 01:03:37,112
Sneeze on him, one spray, tss,
he's done. Don't miss.

941
01:03:39,362 --> 01:03:41,397
Hitting Roy's man could
complicate things for us.

942
01:03:41,481 --> 01:03:44,951
Well, at the price
Leo's willing to pay,

943
01:03:45,041 --> 01:03:46,440
this will be it.

944
01:03:46,521 --> 01:03:48,671
So how's
Atlantic City looking?

945
01:03:48,761 --> 01:03:52,231
Eh, I should have bought
in before gambling went legal.

946
01:03:52,361 --> 01:03:53,714
Richard Kuklinski,
a landlord.

947
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:57,276
Shit, I give
you two months.

948
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:59,715
You're going to be bored
out of your fucking tree.

949
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:02,553
More likely they'll find a couple
tenants under the boardwalk.

950
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:10,637
Think people are looking
at you, just act gay.

951
01:04:10,719 --> 01:04:12,437
You know, swishy.

952
01:05:34,473 --> 01:05:36,828
Polack, what the fuck
are you doing here?

953
01:05:36,913 --> 01:05:38,232
Where are you going?
Where are you going?

954
01:05:44,152 --> 01:05:47,303
Baby. Baby, you okay?
What happened?

955
01:05:47,432 --> 01:05:50,708
Somebody call an ambulance!
Are you sick?

956
01:05:55,431 --> 01:05:57,581
Hey, you fuck...

957
01:05:57,671 --> 01:06:00,310
Yo, Ritchie! Ritchie!

958
01:06:02,351 --> 01:06:04,706
Yo, Ritchie!

959
01:06:04,791 --> 01:06:06,018
Ritchie!

960
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:07,708
I'll meet you
in the car.

961
01:06:07,790 --> 01:06:09,303
Hey!

962
01:06:09,390 --> 01:06:10,789
Yo, we was just
talking about you.

963
01:06:10,870 --> 01:06:12,542
Yeah?

964
01:06:12,630 --> 01:06:15,906
Motherfucker,
look at you, big guy.

965
01:06:15,990 --> 01:06:18,026
How you doing, Terry?

966
01:06:18,110 --> 01:06:19,861
What the hell
happened in there?

967
01:06:19,949 --> 01:06:21,940
I don't know, looked
like a heart attack to me.

968
01:06:22,029 --> 01:06:23,860
Ah!
How you doing, Adele?

969
01:06:23,949 --> 01:06:25,507
I'm good.
How you doing, Ritchie?

970
01:06:25,629 --> 01:06:27,187
Not bad.
Staying fit.

971
01:06:27,269 --> 01:06:29,066
Give us a second, babe?
I'm freezing here.

972
01:06:29,149 --> 01:06:31,708
Just hang,
just one minute, okay?

973
01:06:31,788 --> 01:06:33,585
Okay.

974
01:06:33,668 --> 01:06:35,818
Dino tells me you've been
working in Brooklyn.

975
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:37,899
Says you're the first Polack
that's going to be made.

976
01:06:37,988 --> 01:06:40,707
I don't know
what you're talking about.

977
01:06:40,788 --> 01:06:43,825
He said you got on
with Roy Demeo's crew.

978
01:06:43,908 --> 01:06:45,306
What can I do
for you, Terry?

979
01:06:45,387 --> 01:06:49,699
I could use some work.

980
01:06:49,787 --> 01:06:52,745
I'm married,
I got two kids now.

981
01:06:54,907 --> 01:06:57,023
Well, I'll see what I can do.
Okay?

982
01:06:57,107 --> 01:06:58,664
Good to see you.

983
01:06:58,746 --> 01:07:00,577
Take care, Adele.
Good to see you, Ritchie.

984
01:07:00,666 --> 01:07:02,065
Come on with the fucking guy.

985
01:07:04,506 --> 01:07:07,976
Roses are red, violets...

986
01:07:09,626 --> 01:07:11,502
My Anabel...

987
01:07:13,065 --> 01:07:15,215
is golden...

988
01:07:17,385 --> 01:07:18,977
as the light of the moon.

989
01:07:21,225 --> 01:07:25,263
My Anabel is golden...

990
01:07:25,344 --> 01:07:29,098
as the light of the moon.

991
01:07:29,184 --> 01:07:30,981
Nice.

992
01:07:32,784 --> 01:07:34,820
Nice.

993
01:07:34,944 --> 01:07:38,094
You just take the can,
you drain it and you just dump it.

994
01:07:38,183 --> 01:07:40,981
Yeah, I am excited.
Gosh, oh my gosh, I'm 16!

995
01:07:41,063 --> 01:07:44,135
Or what? Nobody's
even eating any of this.

996
01:07:44,223 --> 01:07:45,781
I don't like it.

997
01:07:45,863 --> 01:07:47,535
Hi.

998
01:07:47,663 --> 01:07:50,097
How you doing, baby?

999
01:07:50,182 --> 01:07:52,650
That looks nice, honey.
Excuse me, Ritchie.

1000
01:07:52,742 --> 01:07:54,812
That's what I really
want for my birthday.

1001
01:08:05,021 --> 01:08:06,249
What are you doing?

1002
01:08:06,341 --> 01:08:07,774
Got a speech. I love it.

1003
01:08:07,861 --> 01:08:11,092
Yeah. Yeah.

1004
01:08:11,181 --> 01:08:14,491
Okay.

1005
01:08:14,581 --> 01:08:17,697
Roses are red,
violets are blue.

1006
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:22,058
My Anabel is as golden
as the light of the moon.

1007
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:23,255
Salud!

1008
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:24,455
I'm not finished.

1009
01:08:27,460 --> 01:08:31,657
Today is her birthday,
a blessing for all.

1010
01:08:31,739 --> 01:08:35,288
Let's wish her a good one,
and have us a ball.

1011
01:08:37,339 --> 01:08:41,298
That's beautiful!
Happy birthday!

1012
01:08:41,419 --> 01:08:43,056
Thank you.
Oh, baby, I love you so much.

1013
01:08:43,138 --> 01:08:45,732
He wrote the same poem
for my sweet sixteen.

1014
01:08:45,818 --> 01:08:47,649
Oh, really?
Happy birthday.

1015
01:08:47,738 --> 01:08:49,330
Thank you.
You look great.

1016
01:08:49,418 --> 01:08:50,817
Hey, baby.
Thank you so much.

1017
01:08:50,898 --> 01:08:53,093
I didn't know
you had it in you.

1018
01:08:53,178 --> 01:08:54,531
Happy birthday!

1019
01:08:54,618 --> 01:08:56,209
Who wants cake?
I want some cake.

1020
01:08:56,297 --> 01:08:58,015
I got
the knife over here.

1021
01:08:58,097 --> 01:08:59,894
Happy sweet 16th...

1022
01:09:01,457 --> 01:09:02,526
Aw, thank you.

1023
01:09:07,577 --> 01:09:09,771
Hey, Ritchie.
What the fuck are you doing here?

1024
01:09:09,856 --> 01:09:12,654
Roy wants to see you.
I don't give a shit. Get lost.

1025
01:09:12,736 --> 01:09:14,727
Happy birthday.

1026
01:09:14,816 --> 01:09:18,013
Thank you. Oh my gosh.
Look at this!

1027
01:09:42,174 --> 01:09:44,529
All right, Roy, do you mind
moving down the block?

1028
01:09:44,614 --> 01:09:48,526
My daughter's birthday's
going on in there.

1029
01:09:48,613 --> 01:09:54,210
Roy, I have guests.
My whole family is there.

1030
01:09:54,293 --> 01:09:57,971
Maybe I should go in and say
happy birthday to her.

1031
01:10:00,653 --> 01:10:02,290
You're doing hits
with Freezy

1032
01:10:02,412 --> 01:10:05,210
for Leo Marks
behind my back?

1033
01:10:05,332 --> 01:10:07,721
After what I've been
through with Rosenthal?

1034
01:10:07,812 --> 01:10:11,600
Now you're going to send me
to another fucking funeral?

1035
01:10:11,692 --> 01:10:13,762
I don't know what you're
talking about.

1036
01:10:13,852 --> 01:10:17,207
Don't fucking lie to me.
Who do you think you're talking to?

1037
01:10:17,291 --> 01:10:19,122
You fucking lie to me.

1038
01:10:22,571 --> 01:10:24,402
Maybe we'll talk
to your friend Terry,

1039
01:10:24,491 --> 01:10:27,243
seems to think that
you and I are friends.

1040
01:10:29,170 --> 01:10:31,730
I can't imagine what
you've been telling them.

1041
01:10:34,050 --> 01:10:38,202
Poor sons of bitches, thinking
their dad's a decent guy.

1042
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:42,444
What are you
going to tell your wife

1043
01:10:42,529 --> 01:10:47,683
when I fucking blow your kids'
heads off?

1044
01:10:47,769 --> 01:10:51,808
You think you got
something good?

1045
01:10:51,889 --> 01:10:55,847
Man becomes so full of it,
he forgets what's true.

1046
01:10:55,928 --> 01:10:56,917
Roy.

1047
01:11:01,248 --> 01:11:03,557
Jimmy, get her the fuck
out of here, now.

1048
01:11:06,048 --> 01:11:07,765
Go back inside.

1049
01:11:07,887 --> 01:11:09,718
Don't let him touch her.
Don't let him touch her.

1050
01:11:09,847 --> 01:11:10,916
Daddy?

1051
01:11:12,607 --> 01:11:13,756
Daddy?

1052
01:11:16,167 --> 01:11:17,520
What's going on?

1053
01:11:17,647 --> 01:11:19,603
All right, Jimmy,
wait a minute.

1054
01:11:23,046 --> 01:11:26,038
You best be looking over
your shoulder

1055
01:11:26,126 --> 01:11:27,878
'cause if we cross
paths again,

1056
01:11:27,966 --> 01:11:30,799
I'm going to bury your whole
fucking family.

1057
01:11:30,886 --> 01:11:34,798
Now get out of my
fucking car, Polack.

1058
01:11:41,525 --> 01:11:45,040
Hey, baby.
It's okay.

1059
01:11:45,125 --> 01:11:46,034
Who are they?

1060
01:11:46,124 --> 01:11:47,193
Oh, nobody.

1061
01:11:48,964 --> 01:11:51,000
Nobody you
need to worry about.

1062
01:11:58,324 --> 01:12:00,837
Relax. Everything's okay.
I'll be in in a second.

1063
01:12:04,123 --> 01:12:06,159
It's fine.
You're fine.

1064
01:12:11,043 --> 01:12:12,441
Everything okay, Ritchie?

1065
01:12:12,522 --> 01:12:16,197
What the fuck
did you tell Terry?

1066
01:12:21,802 --> 01:12:24,032
What the...
I don't know.

1067
01:12:24,122 --> 01:12:25,793
You should probably
go talk to him.

1068
01:12:28,041 --> 01:12:30,077
What happened?
Eh, eh...

1069
01:12:30,161 --> 01:12:31,833
It's a misunderstanding.

1070
01:12:31,921 --> 01:12:34,389
It's Anabel's birthday,
Ritchie.

1071
01:12:34,481 --> 01:12:36,312
I got in a deal
with the wrong guys.

1072
01:12:36,401 --> 01:12:38,675
They want the interest paid
before I sell the currency.

1073
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:40,432
And they came here
to collect?

1074
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:42,272
They're not
from the bank.

1075
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:44,316
You are full
of shit, Ritchie.

1076
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:47,790
Yeah... yeah.

1077
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:50,519
All right, I'm going back down.
You should come.

1078
01:12:52,639 --> 01:12:55,392
Dad? What is going on?
It's okay, honey.

1079
01:12:55,479 --> 01:12:56,912
Are you coming back
to the party?

1080
01:12:56,999 --> 01:12:59,354
I'll be down
in a second, sweetie.

1081
01:12:59,439 --> 01:13:00,667
Fuck!

1082
01:13:19,477 --> 01:13:23,595
Yeah, I got this guy
in Connecticut, Sam Gunderson.

1083
01:13:23,677 --> 01:13:26,271
He fences
Corvettes to Kuwait.

1084
01:13:26,357 --> 01:13:29,747
For every one you bring him, he'll give
you 40 percent on the window price.

1085
01:13:29,837 --> 01:13:31,986
What's the game plan?

1086
01:13:32,076 --> 01:13:33,668
You just scout the dealership,
pretend you want to buy.

1087
01:13:33,756 --> 01:13:35,986
T ake a test drive,
and you get a key made.

1088
01:13:36,076 --> 01:13:39,307
Come back later and
take it off the lot.

1089
01:13:42,436 --> 01:13:44,232
Just like that?

1090
01:13:44,315 --> 01:13:45,873
What about you?

1091
01:13:45,955 --> 01:13:48,310
What about me?
I was just thinking.

1092
01:13:48,395 --> 01:13:50,147
I got nothing
to do with it.

1093
01:13:50,235 --> 01:13:51,907
You asked me to hook
you up with a job, I did.

1094
01:13:51,995 --> 01:13:55,431
Thank you, Ritchie.
Thank you.

1095
01:13:55,515 --> 01:13:58,108
There's a York Motel
in Jersey City.

1096
01:13:58,194 --> 01:14:00,947
Tomorrow night I'll introduce
you to Sale.

1097
01:14:01,034 --> 01:14:05,630
Okay. Uh, I forgot
to tell you.

1098
01:14:05,714 --> 01:14:10,833
I met your friend
Roy Demeo at Yawns.

1099
01:14:10,913 --> 01:14:13,473
Yeah, I heard
about that.

1100
01:14:13,553 --> 01:14:15,908
He pretended
he didn't know you.

1101
01:14:15,993 --> 01:14:19,542
That's okay.

1102
01:14:19,633 --> 01:14:21,908
I'll see you
tomorrow, Terry.

1103
01:14:21,993 --> 01:14:23,903
Thanks again.
Thanks again.

1104
01:14:43,231 --> 01:14:45,222
You want to be
my friend, Terry?

1105
01:14:48,311 --> 01:14:50,266
Then you keep
your fucking mouth shut.

1106
01:14:53,550 --> 01:14:55,984
Oh! Oh! Oh my.

1107
01:14:56,070 --> 01:14:57,788
What did Santa get me?

1108
01:14:58,870 --> 01:15:02,828
Oh.

1109
01:15:04,309 --> 01:15:07,301
Oh, oh, my...
Let me see.

1110
01:15:07,389 --> 01:15:10,142
You like it?
Oh...

1111
01:15:10,229 --> 01:15:11,742
Mm, I love you.

1112
01:15:11,829 --> 01:15:13,421
I love you.
Look at this.

1113
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:15,227
Um, Dad.

1114
01:15:15,308 --> 01:15:19,665
Can you believe this.
I can't believe I got it.

1115
01:15:19,788 --> 01:15:21,983
I have got
to try this on.

1116
01:15:22,068 --> 01:15:26,027
Mom, is it okay if I
go over to Amanda's?

1117
01:15:26,108 --> 01:15:28,416
It's Christmas Day.

1118
01:15:28,547 --> 01:15:32,062
I know, I know, but I just, I want to
give her a present before she leaves.

1119
01:15:32,147 --> 01:15:35,423
An hour, tops.
Okay, okay.

1120
01:15:35,507 --> 01:15:37,338
All right, look at how it...

1121
01:15:37,427 --> 01:15:39,099
Oh, my gosh.

1122
01:15:39,187 --> 01:15:42,223
This is, this is...
So pretty.

1123
01:15:42,306 --> 01:15:45,298
Honey,
I can't get the clasp.

1124
01:15:45,386 --> 01:15:47,775
Damn.

1125
01:15:47,866 --> 01:15:50,061
Where are you going?
I'll be right back.

1126
01:15:50,146 --> 01:15:52,740
On Christmas Day? Honey.

1127
01:15:52,826 --> 01:15:55,976
Yeah, yeah. I know, Deb.
I'll be right back.

1128
01:15:56,065 --> 01:15:57,737
Leo's fucking paranoid.

1129
01:15:57,865 --> 01:15:59,662
He thinks Roy knows
he ordered the hit.

1130
01:15:59,745 --> 01:16:01,975
So now he's only offering
ten Gs. You there?

1131
01:16:02,065 --> 01:16:03,180
Yeah.

1132
01:16:04,985 --> 01:16:07,101
Yeah, it's been three months
already. Come on.

1133
01:16:07,185 --> 01:16:09,015
Listen, we'll take
the ten grand.

1134
01:16:09,104 --> 01:16:10,457
It's generous
considering the circumstances.

1135
01:16:10,584 --> 01:16:12,654
Atlantic City can wait.
No.

1136
01:16:12,744 --> 01:16:15,497
This is it.
This money, this job.

1137
01:16:15,584 --> 01:16:18,144
No, we'll wait for this to settle,
and put the word out.

1138
01:16:18,224 --> 01:16:20,783
Two or three more jobs,
you can put a down payment on Steel Pier.

1139
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:22,296
Where is he
going to be at?

1140
01:16:22,383 --> 01:16:24,851
Dad?
It's a cemetery in Bergen.

1141
01:16:24,943 --> 01:16:26,581
Dad?
Hey! Fuck.

1142
01:16:26,663 --> 01:16:28,540
Hello?
Yes, yes, I'm here.

1143
01:16:28,623 --> 01:16:30,375
Leo Marks is not man we can fuck with.
Do you hear me?

1144
01:16:30,463 --> 01:16:32,454
Dad, it's not working.

1145
01:16:32,543 --> 01:16:35,852
I said I'm on the fucking
phone! Polack. Hello?

1146
01:17:11,580 --> 01:17:14,377
We did him
in a crowded club.

1147
01:17:14,459 --> 01:17:18,896
That's a risk
I don't normally take.

1148
01:17:18,979 --> 01:17:21,209
Forty plus ten
was the deal.

1149
01:17:21,299 --> 01:17:26,214
You've ruined my fucking Christmas.
You're lucky you get away with ten.

1150
01:17:26,298 --> 01:17:28,493
You promised fifty.

1151
01:17:28,578 --> 01:17:30,057
And Chamberlain
promised peace.

1152
01:17:31,538 --> 01:17:33,688
You know who that is?

1153
01:17:36,218 --> 01:17:40,176
I agreed to meet with you because I was
told you were going to give a discount.

1154
01:17:40,257 --> 01:17:42,851
Three months.

1155
01:17:42,937 --> 01:17:46,486
You keep me waiting
three months.

1156
01:17:46,577 --> 01:17:48,056
Fifty is a discount.

1157
01:17:48,137 --> 01:17:50,970
Fifty is a fuck you.

1158
01:17:51,057 --> 01:17:54,093
You and Freezy better
get your story straight.

1159
01:17:54,176 --> 01:17:57,486
Leo, I just
want to go home.

1160
01:17:57,576 --> 01:17:59,965
I just want my money.

1161
01:18:00,056 --> 01:18:01,648
Hm.

1162
01:18:05,256 --> 01:18:07,928
You got
some pair of balls.

1163
01:18:08,015 --> 01:18:10,768
You fuck up a job and now
you want your money.

1164
01:18:10,855 --> 01:18:13,847
No, now that Roy
knows I hired you,

1165
01:18:13,935 --> 01:18:15,573
you get nothing.

1166
01:18:15,655 --> 01:18:17,088
Give me the money, Leo.

1167
01:18:20,414 --> 01:18:22,644
Get the fuck
out of my car, Polack.

1168
01:18:22,734 --> 01:18:24,133
Yeah!

1169
01:18:24,214 --> 01:18:26,330
Hey, don't you
fucking do that.

1170
01:18:26,414 --> 01:18:29,326
You don't fucking do that.
You're a dead man.

1171
01:18:33,653 --> 01:18:36,087
Look, you're good
at what you do. Okay?

1172
01:18:36,173 --> 01:18:39,449
Don't fuck it up any more
than you already have.

1173
01:18:39,533 --> 01:18:41,489
Now just get out of here.
Go.

1174
01:18:44,972 --> 01:18:47,361
Go home to your family.

1175
01:18:47,452 --> 01:18:52,162
Life can be
very random sometimes.

1176
01:18:52,252 --> 01:18:54,891
Yeah. You're right.

1177
01:19:03,931 --> 01:19:05,046
What the fuck?

1178
01:19:14,530 --> 01:19:16,122
Goddamn it!

1179
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:19,361
You fuck! You fuck!

1180
01:20:07,766 --> 01:20:11,441
Hello?
Betsy? You paged me?

1181
01:20:11,526 --> 01:20:13,801
Yes, Daddy.

1182
01:20:13,886 --> 01:20:16,116
There was an accident.
It's Anabel. She's in the hospital.

1183
01:20:16,206 --> 01:20:17,354
What happened, honey?

1184
01:20:17,445 --> 01:20:19,083
It was a hit and run.

1185
01:20:19,165 --> 01:20:20,644
We're at
Glen Heights Hospital.

1186
01:20:20,725 --> 01:20:22,078
Come on.

1187
01:20:22,165 --> 01:20:23,678
Come now, please!

1188
01:20:33,844 --> 01:20:36,153
Honey.
Hey.

1189
01:20:36,244 --> 01:20:38,553
Hey, sweetie.
Come here.

1190
01:20:38,644 --> 01:20:44,439
Come here, sweetie.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1191
01:20:45,003 --> 01:20:50,236
Hey. That's my...

1192
01:20:50,323 --> 01:20:53,759
I'm going to go in, okay.
Okay.

1193
01:20:53,843 --> 01:20:55,515
Just sit down.
Sit down.

1194
01:21:01,202 --> 01:21:04,877
This is
the end of it.

1195
01:21:04,962 --> 01:21:08,159
There ain't going to be nothing
else to be afraid of.

1196
01:21:08,242 --> 01:21:10,118
I promise.

1197
01:21:10,201 --> 01:21:13,477
I didn't know I was
supposed to be afraid.

1198
01:21:18,081 --> 01:21:21,710
What did the cops say?
Uh, they say a hit and run, no witnesses?

1199
01:21:21,801 --> 01:21:23,438
Did they get a make
and model on the car?

1200
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:25,232
I don't know.
Well, didn't you talk to them?

1201
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:27,914
This was done
on purpose.

1202
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,638
They were just waiting
for her, Ritchie.

1203
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:31,711
Three blocks
from our house.

1204
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:36,036
No, don't you
touch her.

1205
01:21:42,039 --> 01:21:43,631
I'm going to find out
who did this.

1206
01:21:43,719 --> 01:21:45,072
Yeah, you better.

1207
01:21:51,438 --> 01:21:53,076
Oh, my God.

1208
01:22:00,158 --> 01:22:05,993
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!

1209
01:22:06,077 --> 01:22:11,754
Sorry! I'm sorry!

1210
01:22:43,634 --> 01:22:46,785
You're looking a little pale, Polack.
How are you?

1211
01:22:46,874 --> 01:22:49,468
I'm not sure.
Why are you all cleaned up?

1212
01:22:49,554 --> 01:22:51,988
Yeah, well,
let me give you a clue.

1213
01:22:52,074 --> 01:22:56,271
We both should
be scared shitless.

1214
01:22:56,353 --> 01:22:58,548
Well, they're not looking
for an ice cream truck.

1215
01:22:58,633 --> 01:23:00,305
I know, they're looking
for the Iceman.

1216
01:23:00,393 --> 01:23:02,304
Lucky son
of a bitch.

1217
01:23:02,393 --> 01:23:05,226
I ought to charge you royalties
for headlines like that.

1218
01:23:09,992 --> 01:23:13,029
That was your friend, right?
Guy outside the club?

1219
01:23:13,112 --> 01:23:15,103
Yeah, but he's
not my friend.

1220
01:23:15,192 --> 01:23:17,069
No shit.

1221
01:23:17,152 --> 01:23:19,268
Listen, it's only
a matter of time now.

1222
01:23:19,352 --> 01:23:22,309
Roy knows he's a dead man unless
you come forward on Leo Marks.

1223
01:23:22,391 --> 01:23:26,862
He's got to prove
you pulled the trigger.

1224
01:23:26,951 --> 01:23:30,421
My wife.
Our kids.

1225
01:23:30,511 --> 01:23:32,263
They're all fucking
threats now.

1226
01:23:32,351 --> 01:23:33,703
Doesn't matter
if they love you

1227
01:23:33,790 --> 01:23:35,667
if they think
you're a murderer.

1228
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:38,025
Maybe there's a way we
can do each other a favor.

1229
01:23:38,110 --> 01:23:39,099
What?

1230
01:23:44,030 --> 01:23:46,179
Kill my family.

1231
01:23:46,269 --> 01:23:49,545
You kill mine,
I'll kill yours.

1232
01:23:49,629 --> 01:23:51,904
I know where you live.
I wouldn't even wake you up.

1233
01:23:57,309 --> 01:23:59,868
Listen, the way
I see it, it's a lose lose.

1234
01:23:59,948 --> 01:24:02,223
Either we get pinched,
or Roy finds us.

1235
01:24:02,308 --> 01:24:05,505
Either way, we go away
and everybody suffers.

1236
01:24:05,588 --> 01:24:07,499
How do you know?
What?

1237
01:24:09,828 --> 01:24:12,625
How do you know
where I live?

1238
01:24:12,707 --> 01:24:14,618
Course I know where you live.
You mentioned it.

1239
01:24:16,747 --> 01:24:20,057
Nah. I never
told you that.

1240
01:24:22,467 --> 01:24:24,298
Fuck!

1241
01:24:24,387 --> 01:24:25,899
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

1242
01:24:29,066 --> 01:24:30,943
Get your hand out
of your pocket.

1243
01:24:31,026 --> 01:24:32,664
I'm getting
a fucking tissue.

1244
01:24:32,746 --> 01:24:33,895
Relax!

1245
01:24:36,546 --> 01:24:39,662
Fuck! Jesus Christ!

1246
01:24:39,745 --> 01:24:41,622
You know, considering
your nerves

1247
01:24:41,705 --> 01:24:45,095
maybe we should renegotiate
our little partnership, pal.

1248
01:24:45,225 --> 01:24:49,377
Can I blow my nose now?
Jesus Christ.

1249
01:25:23,342 --> 01:25:25,617
What's up, Ritchie?

1250
01:25:25,702 --> 01:25:29,615
Shit. Hey.
I'm fucking exhausted.

1251
01:25:33,221 --> 01:25:34,973
How do you know
this guy?

1252
01:25:35,061 --> 01:25:36,460
He used to work with me.
Yeah?

1253
01:25:36,541 --> 01:25:38,691
Chopping twenties
at the store.

1254
01:25:38,781 --> 01:25:41,534
Sister used to work for a chemist,
so he's probably your best bet.

1255
01:25:41,621 --> 01:25:42,974
You trust him?

1256
01:25:43,061 --> 01:25:46,018
Do I trust him?
Yeah, I guess.

1257
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:48,978
It's not my usual thing,
but he gets whatever I need.

1258
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:50,812
I know him
from Brooklyn.

1259
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:54,529
Dominick Provenzano?
Yeah.

1260
01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:58,214
I'll give him a shot.
I got to kill this cocksucker.

1261
01:25:58,299 --> 01:26:00,813
Ritchie, you don't hurt a guy
like Roy Demeo

1262
01:26:00,899 --> 01:26:02,730
without something happening to you,
you know?

1263
01:26:02,819 --> 01:26:04,810
Yeah, that's why I need it.
There can't be a trace.

1264
01:26:04,939 --> 01:26:07,214
He's coming after my family.
How do you know it's him?

1265
01:26:07,299 --> 01:26:10,017
Because, he said he was going
to come after my family.

1266
01:26:10,138 --> 01:26:11,696
Then get the fuck
out of town.

1267
01:26:11,778 --> 01:26:13,450
Take Deb and the kids
and get out of here.

1268
01:26:13,538 --> 01:26:15,051
Do you need money
or something? Nah.

1269
01:26:15,138 --> 01:26:17,971
Nah, I got to take
care of this first.

1270
01:26:18,098 --> 01:26:21,215
Did you hear about Terry?
Yeah. It's sad.

1271
01:26:21,298 --> 01:26:25,370
It's fucking crazy.
They're calling him the Iceman.

1272
01:26:25,457 --> 01:26:27,687
Terry tells me he's got
something with some guy.

1273
01:26:27,777 --> 01:26:29,688
Next thing you know,
he's fucking dead.

1274
01:26:29,777 --> 01:26:31,927
Found him on the side of the
highway in a garbage bag.

1275
01:26:32,017 --> 01:26:33,973
Fucking crazy killer fucking
freezes his bodies

1276
01:26:34,057 --> 01:26:38,334
so the cops won't know
the fucking time of death.

1277
01:26:38,456 --> 01:26:41,493
I mean, do you believe this shit?

1278
01:26:41,576 --> 01:26:42,565
What guy?

1279
01:26:42,656 --> 01:26:44,647
What do you mean?

1280
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:46,567
Who was Terry
going to meet?

1281
01:26:46,656 --> 01:26:48,772
I don't know.
He never told me.

1282
01:26:48,856 --> 01:26:50,288
The police
talk to you?

1283
01:26:50,375 --> 01:26:51,854
Yeah, twice.
But what do I know?

1284
01:26:54,455 --> 01:26:57,731
Dino, thanks for coming,
all right?

1285
01:26:57,815 --> 01:27:01,524
Hey.
Of course, Ritchie.

1286
01:27:01,615 --> 01:27:02,729
Let's go see the girls,
huh?

1287
01:27:02,854 --> 01:27:03,889
Yeah.

1288
01:27:19,453 --> 01:27:21,409
How you doing?
Dominick.

1289
01:27:21,493 --> 01:27:24,087
Yeah. Wow,
you're a big guy.

1290
01:27:24,173 --> 01:27:26,368
A lot bigger than you
sound on the phone.

1291
01:27:26,453 --> 01:27:27,806
Hey, you know
what they say.

1292
01:27:27,893 --> 01:27:29,211
No, I have no idea.

1293
01:27:29,292 --> 01:27:30,486
That's just what
they say.

1294
01:27:35,252 --> 01:27:38,210
So...
One sec.

1295
01:27:38,292 --> 01:27:40,248
Look, I'll be honest
with you, you know?

1296
01:27:40,332 --> 01:27:41,844
I like Dino,
but, you know,

1297
01:27:41,971 --> 01:27:43,882
sometimes he's
so full of it

1298
01:27:43,971 --> 01:27:45,962
you never really know who
his friends are. You know?

1299
01:27:46,051 --> 01:27:48,884
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
So, look, you know.

1300
01:27:48,971 --> 01:27:52,122
I, I don't really understand this
whole cyanide thing, you know?

1301
01:27:52,211 --> 01:27:56,806
I'm curious, you know,
how's this thing work?

1302
01:27:56,890 --> 01:27:58,960
You put the stuff in a mist.

1303
01:27:59,050 --> 01:28:03,089
You spray it in someone's face,
they fall asleep.

1304
01:28:03,170 --> 01:28:08,402
I tell you, you know, it could
take some time to get that shit.

1305
01:28:08,489 --> 01:28:09,922
How long
are we talking?

1306
01:28:10,009 --> 01:28:11,886
Well, it might take
a week or two.

1307
01:28:11,969 --> 01:28:13,641
That's too long.

1308
01:28:13,729 --> 01:28:17,005
Oh, I mean, I can tell you
wanna, you know.

1309
01:28:17,129 --> 01:28:18,562
I'm going to need
some cash then.

1310
01:28:18,649 --> 01:28:21,082
Not until delivery.

1311
01:28:21,168 --> 01:28:25,958
Well...
it wouldn't have to be.

1312
01:28:26,048 --> 01:28:30,485
Tell you what.
I got this trust fund kid, okay?

1313
01:28:30,568 --> 01:28:33,241
I've been supplying him with
coke for about couple years now.

1314
01:28:33,328 --> 01:28:35,318
He wants me to get him two Ks.

1315
01:28:35,407 --> 01:28:39,446
All this cyanide talk and everything,
it's got me thinking.

1316
01:28:39,567 --> 01:28:42,525
Thinking what?

1317
01:28:42,607 --> 01:28:45,917
We could kill two birds
here with one stone.

1318
01:28:46,007 --> 01:28:47,917
Well, that's always
a good idea.

1319
01:28:48,006 --> 01:28:50,122
Kill two birds
with one stone.

1320
01:28:50,206 --> 01:28:53,915
Hey, you know, I could...
I could take care of the cyanide

1321
01:28:54,006 --> 01:28:58,443
but, I'm going to need you
to take care of the kid.

1322
01:29:00,685 --> 01:29:02,994
Why?

1323
01:29:03,085 --> 01:29:04,996
He's a fucking
degenerate.

1324
01:29:05,085 --> 01:29:07,360
He's got markers all over the
fucking place, you know?

1325
01:29:07,445 --> 01:29:12,200
Besides, he holds a grudge. He's
liable to blackmail me and bail him out.

1326
01:29:12,285 --> 01:29:14,161
You do me this favor

1327
01:29:14,244 --> 01:29:16,997
and I'll split you with his
payment 50-50, okay?

1328
01:29:17,084 --> 01:29:19,803
We'll keep the coke
and the cash.

1329
01:29:19,884 --> 01:29:21,875
Deal is worth
60 grand, easy.

1330
01:29:21,964 --> 01:29:24,637
And I'll have that shit to you
by next week. No problem.

1331
01:29:24,724 --> 01:29:27,157
Who you work for?

1332
01:29:27,243 --> 01:29:29,154
I work with Luchezi family.
You know?

1333
01:29:29,243 --> 01:29:31,040
But I got to keep that
low key, you know?

1334
01:29:31,123 --> 01:29:33,557
They want a piece of every
fucking thing that I got.

1335
01:29:33,643 --> 01:29:34,996
Don't worry.

1336
01:29:35,083 --> 01:29:36,801
I'm Polish.
I work for everybody.

1337
01:29:39,003 --> 01:29:41,562
That's good to hear.

1338
01:29:41,642 --> 01:29:44,839
He likes the offer, but he's
still looking for 315.

1339
01:29:44,962 --> 01:29:49,035
And he'll get it, too,
with property that close to Atlantic City.

1340
01:29:49,122 --> 01:29:53,319
315, huh? What's the down
payment on that?

1341
01:29:53,401 --> 01:29:55,278
We could have gone
at 15 percent,

1342
01:29:55,361 --> 01:29:56,874
but because it's all cash,
it's 40 grand.

1343
01:29:56,961 --> 01:30:00,715
40. Okay.

1344
01:30:04,841 --> 01:30:06,558
Tell them I'm in.

1345
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:08,551
I'll have the balance
in the next couple days.

1346
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:09,789
You sure?

1347
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:11,791
Yeah, I'm working on it.

1348
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:14,314
It's as sound as it gets,
Mr. Kuklinski.

1349
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,231
There's no reason
the building

1350
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:18,231
won't be filled by the
end of the year.

1351
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:20,275
Can you come by tomorrow
to finish the paperwork?

1352
01:30:20,359 --> 01:30:22,270
Yeah, I'll call you
to schedule tomorrow.

1353
01:30:22,359 --> 01:30:24,589
I hope you're
as excited as I am.

1354
01:30:24,679 --> 01:30:26,397
Yeah, I am.

1355
01:30:26,479 --> 01:30:29,073
Great!
Take care, Mr. Kuklinski.

1356
01:30:29,159 --> 01:30:30,148
Thanks.

1357
01:30:39,158 --> 01:30:40,796
How are you feeling?

1358
01:30:40,878 --> 01:30:41,947
Agh.

1359
01:30:49,757 --> 01:30:51,076
You still got
a fever.

1360
01:30:51,157 --> 01:30:53,717
Mm.

1361
01:30:53,797 --> 01:30:57,426
I left Anabel...
physical therapy at 4:00.

1362
01:30:57,517 --> 01:30:59,268
Yeah, I'll take her.

1363
01:30:59,356 --> 01:31:01,233
Oh, it's just the flu, Ritchie.
I can do it.

1364
01:31:01,316 --> 01:31:05,070
Uh-uh. Let the doctor
tell me that.

1365
01:31:11,995 --> 01:31:13,872
I'll make you
an appointment, okay?

1366
01:31:13,955 --> 01:31:15,513
Okay.

1367
01:31:33,794 --> 01:31:35,466
Hey, how you doing,
big guy?

1368
01:31:35,554 --> 01:31:37,589
Show me
what you got.

1369
01:31:37,673 --> 01:31:41,985
Please, I had a half a dozen
waivers to forge for that shit.

1370
01:31:42,073 --> 01:31:44,587
It's 11:00 now.
See you back here at 1:30.

1371
01:31:44,673 --> 01:31:46,789
What time did you
tell the kid?

1372
01:31:46,873 --> 01:31:50,183
2:00. Hey, you going to put the,
uh, cyanide in the coke, right?

1373
01:31:50,273 --> 01:31:51,785
No, I'm going
to make sandwiches.

1374
01:31:51,912 --> 01:31:55,507
It's lunchtime.
We'll eat, too. Okay?

1375
01:32:31,309 --> 01:32:32,264
Here you go
come on.

1376
01:32:32,349 --> 01:32:33,577
Here, kitty.

1377
01:32:37,269 --> 01:32:39,658
Here you go.
Yeah, good, huh?

1378
01:33:01,347 --> 01:33:04,737
Okay. All right.
There you go.

1379
01:33:26,185 --> 01:33:29,063
Something's not right.

1380
01:33:29,145 --> 01:33:30,373
Honey?

1381
01:33:31,745 --> 01:33:33,019
Nothing.

1382
01:33:50,703 --> 01:33:52,022
Oh, my God!

1383
01:33:53,863 --> 01:33:55,091
Ritchie!

1384
01:33:56,183 --> 01:33:57,377
Ritchie!

1385
01:34:02,022 --> 01:34:03,580
Oh, my God!

1386
01:34:03,662 --> 01:34:06,096
Get out of the car,
Mr. Kuklinski!

1387
01:34:06,182 --> 01:34:07,376
Get out of the vehicle!

1388
01:34:07,462 --> 01:34:09,612
Ritchie?
Don't move.

1389
01:34:09,742 --> 01:34:11,937
Get the fuck out of the car now!
Keep your hands up!

1390
01:34:12,022 --> 01:34:15,900
Get out of the fucking car now!
Put your hands up!

1391
01:34:15,981 --> 01:34:17,858
Put your hands
on the wheel!

1392
01:34:17,941 --> 01:34:19,420
Open the door!

1393
01:34:19,501 --> 01:34:22,061
Get the fuck
out of the car now!

1394
01:34:22,141 --> 01:34:24,974
It's locked.
Get out of the car now!

1395
01:34:25,061 --> 01:34:26,653
Break it!

1396
01:34:26,741 --> 01:34:28,571
Put your hands somewhere
I can see them!

1397
01:34:28,660 --> 01:34:30,969
No! No! Don't!

1398
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:32,249
Don't you touch him!

1399
01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:33,773
Get out of the car!

1400
01:34:33,860 --> 01:34:36,738
Come here!
Don't you touch my...

1401
01:34:36,820 --> 01:34:38,538
Ritchie!

1402
01:34:38,620 --> 01:34:40,611
You leave her alone!

1403
01:34:40,699 --> 01:34:42,576
You fucking sons
of a bitches!

1404
01:34:42,699 --> 01:34:46,328
I'll fucking kill every last one of you!
Ritchie!

1405
01:34:46,419 --> 01:34:48,694
Throw him
down right now.

1406
01:34:48,779 --> 01:34:50,849
Come on, in.

1407
01:34:50,939 --> 01:34:54,294
Get him down!

1408
01:34:54,378 --> 01:34:56,255
Put him down!
No!

1409
01:34:56,338 --> 01:34:57,930
Get him down!
No!

1410
01:34:58,018 --> 01:35:00,054
Take him down.

1411
01:35:07,082 --> 01:35:08,052
Ritchie!

1412
01:35:08,659 --> 01:35:09,853
Ritchie!

1413
01:35:10,897 --> 01:35:12,455
Hold him down!
Hold him down!

1414
01:35:12,537 --> 01:35:14,175
You've got the right
to remain silent.

1415
01:35:14,257 --> 01:35:16,532
Anything you say or do
can and will be...

1416
01:35:16,617 --> 01:35:19,256
All these fucking guys
for one little guy!

1417
01:35:19,337 --> 01:35:22,373
Huh? You think
you're fucking tough?

1418
01:35:22,456 --> 01:35:24,606
Come on, you piece of shit.

1419
01:35:30,336 --> 01:35:34,248
Get him in!
Come on, get in!

1420
01:35:34,335 --> 01:35:35,324
Close the door!

1421
01:35:46,494 --> 01:35:49,088
Great job.

1422
01:35:49,214 --> 01:35:51,284
Hey, Dominick!

1423
01:35:51,374 --> 01:35:53,842
Good job.

1424
01:35:53,934 --> 01:35:55,526
Yeah!

1425
01:35:55,614 --> 01:35:56,649
Yeah.

1426
01:36:00,573 --> 01:36:01,642
You recognize that guy?

1427
01:36:06,213 --> 01:36:08,408
Ritchie.

1428
01:36:08,493 --> 01:36:10,245
Rich!
Rich!

1429
01:36:31,091 --> 01:36:33,764
Law enforcement authorities
have arrested

1430
01:36:33,851 --> 01:36:35,489
one of the most notorious

1431
01:36:35,571 --> 01:36:37,721
contract killers
in state history.

1432
01:36:37,811 --> 01:36:40,722
A self-employed Bergen County
man is behind bars.

1433
01:36:40,810 --> 01:36:45,247
He is such a cold-blooded killer,
they call him The Iceman.

1434
01:36:45,330 --> 01:36:47,969
Mr. Kuklinski,
please rise.

1435
01:36:55,849 --> 01:36:58,807
I never felt sorry
for anything I done...

1436
01:37:00,529 --> 01:37:02,326
other than hurting
my family.

1437
01:37:07,568 --> 01:37:10,480
The only thing
I feel sorry for.

1438
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:17,238
I'm not looking
for forgiveness.

1439
01:37:19,247 --> 01:37:20,521
I'm not repenting.

1440
01:37:25,927 --> 01:37:27,679
I know I'm wrong.

1441
01:37:31,286 --> 01:37:32,514
I'm wrong.

1442
01:37:38,006 --> 01:37:41,999
I do want my family
to forgive me.

1443
01:37:44,045 --> 01:37:47,117
Oh, boy.

1444
01:37:50,165 --> 01:37:52,599
Ain't going to make
this one.

1445
01:38:00,244 --> 01:38:01,563
Holy shit.

1446
01:38:08,604 --> 01:38:10,673
This would never be me.

1447
01:38:13,923 --> 01:38:17,552
This would not be me.

1448
01:38:22,323 --> 01:38:24,517
You see the Iceman crying?

1449
01:38:26,762 --> 01:38:28,275
Not very macho.

1450
01:38:36,681 --> 01:38:38,319
But I hurt people...

1451
01:38:41,241 --> 01:38:43,596
that mean
everything to me.

1452
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:55,152
But the only people that
mean anything to me.

1453
01:39:52,876 --> 01:39:56,948
# Walk on down the road #

1454
01:39:57,035 --> 01:40:02,746
# Two separate lives #

1455
01:40:02,835 --> 01:40:06,874
# One not more
than the other #

1456
01:40:06,995 --> 01:40:11,863
# Unbalanced my mind #

1457
01:40:13,554 --> 01:40:16,785
# Forget regret #

1458
01:40:16,874 --> 01:40:22,823
# There's no looking back #

1459
01:40:22,913 --> 01:40:26,223
# Sometimes I wish
I was another #

1460
01:40:26,313 --> 01:40:29,988
# But there's no looking back #

1461
01:40:33,433 --> 01:40:36,504
# Don't stand
never change it #

1462
01:40:36,592 --> 01:40:39,743
# Steady to middle #

1463
01:40:42,912 --> 01:40:46,791
# Black and white
Two straight lines #

1464
01:40:46,872 --> 01:40:50,386
# To the bitter end #

1465
01:40:57,871 --> 01:41:01,465
# Oooh #

1466
01:41:01,550 --> 01:41:03,298
# Ooh ooh #

1467
01:41:03,802 --> 01:41:05,687
# Ooh ooh #

1468
01:41:18,669 --> 01:41:22,378
# No one sees pain #

1469
01:41:22,469 --> 01:41:24,585
# It's not on display #

1470
01:41:28,388 --> 01:41:32,427
# Deep into my silence #

1471
01:41:32,508 --> 01:41:34,385
# You fade into gray #

1472
01:41:38,948 --> 01:41:42,144
# Where did I get off #

1473
01:41:42,227 --> 01:41:45,617
# And who's got my back #

1474
01:41:48,827 --> 01:41:51,785
# Since I'm doing shows
and other #

1475
01:41:51,867 --> 01:41:54,175
# But there's no looking back #

1476
01:41:59,026 --> 01:42:02,416
# Constant never changing #

1477
01:42:02,506 --> 01:42:08,102
# Steady to middle #

1478
01:42:08,185 --> 01:42:12,337
# Black and white
Two straight lines #

1479
01:42:12,425 --> 01:42:13,778
# To the bitter end #

1480
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:27,668
# Oooh #

1481
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:29,512
# Ooh ooh #

1482
01:42:32,120 --> 01:42:35,317
# Ooh ooh #

1483
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:42,037
# Ooh ooh #

1484
01:42:43,305 --> 01:43:43,418
