2
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,750
Broken down
and blocked up the whole street.

3
00:01:33,175 --> 00:01:35,680
- Okay, lady, two slices for you.
- Move it up, come on.

4
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:37,000
Come on.

5
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,100
Keno.

6
00:01:41,265 --> 00:01:43,435
Yo, Keno.
Come on, huh? Saddle up.

7
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,685
We got another order
for that O'Neil woman.

8
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:49,190
Are you kidding me? Again?
She should be buying it wholesale.

9
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,525
- Don't forget, do the dishes.
- Okay. Yeah.

10
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,320
- Keno, be careful.
- Okay.

11
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,115
So anyway, last Saturday night...

12
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,490
- Hey, ladies.
- It's Broadway and, like...

13
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,285
Which one of you lucky girls
gets a ride with me tonight?

14
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,620
Dream on, dweeb.

15
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,165
Yeah, okay.

16
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:09,750
But when I do, I'll dream
of something a little thinner. Ha, ha, ha.

17
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,772
April O'Neil.

18
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,042
That's nice.

19
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,253
Stack her over here.

20
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:53,380
Six boxes.

21
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,340
- Hold it.
- Huh?

22
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,009
You guys are under arrest.

23
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,096
What are you, night security?

24
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:05,434
Well, no. Actually, I'm, uh, pizza delivery.

25
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,103
Cut me a break.

26
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,608
Down we go.

27
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,366
Stay down.

28
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:25,454
Did I mention I study martial arts?

29
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,497
Okay, let's move it out.

30
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:28,790
- Hey.
- Hey, hey, hey.

31
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,168
- What do you think this guy is?
- Let's get him.

32
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,377
- Help?
- Yeah.

33
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,879
You're gonna need it, kid.

34
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,964
Come on.

35
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,981
- Let's get out of here. Let's go.
- Move it. Move it.

36
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,443
Awesome.

37
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,821
Hey.

38
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,573
Wicked.

39
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,787
- Eclectic. Heh-heh.
- Yeah, ha.

40
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,499
Eclectic? Jeez. Whoa.

41
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,084
Oops.

42
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,339
- Look out.
- Hey.

43
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,883
Let me go. What are you doing?

44
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:24,346
Sorry, kid. It's for your own good.

45
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,516
- Let me out of here.
- Go.

46
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,189
Yeah.

47
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,485
Get along there, little doggy.

48
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,196
Rawhide. RoboCop.

49
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,698
Come on.

50
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,202
Yeehaw.

51
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,871
Ninja cowboy.

52
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,838
Oh, you dudes wanna play too?

53
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,718
Heh-heh. Wait, wait, wait.

54
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,303
Check this.

55
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,805
Walk the Dog.

56
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,890
That's pretty good, huh?

57
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:12,019
And then Around the World.

58
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,896
Hey, hey. Now you see them,
now you don't.

59
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:17,983
Missed.

60
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,903
Ha.

61
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,032
Ooh. Yeah.

62
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,826
Yeah, yeah.

63
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,414
Huh?

64
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,419
Ha, ha, ha.

65
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:39,921
Hey.

66
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,840
- Yeah.
- Hey.

67
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,508
Hey, ooh, ah, ooh, ooh.

68
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,512
Rawr.

69
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:54,102
Missed me.

70
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,397
Whoa, whoa.

71
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,943
The missing link.

72
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:09,076
You want a pickle? I'll give you a pickle.

73
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:19,294
Combat cold cuts! Whoa!

74
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,266
- Yah!
- Let's get out of here!

75
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:40,982
And next time I'll use mustard. Ha.

76
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,486
Hey.

77
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:47,614
Hey, dude. Give me your hand.

78
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,741
Come on.

79
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:54,329
Who? What? Where? Huh?

80
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:57,457
Well, that leaves out why and when,
doesn't it?

81
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:02,754
Yeah. It's a good thing we saw you
coming in here from the roof...

82
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,965
- Hey, Mikey.
- I mean from across the stree...

83
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,216
Hey.

84
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,009
Jeez.

85
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:11,346
- Look, kid, find a phone and call the police.
- Are you okay?

86
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,640
- We'll start tying them up.
- Yeah, but l...

87
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,809
Yeah, yeah, but good.

88
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,436
Go.

89
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,148
Kids.

90
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:22,357
Come on.

91
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:28,613
Okay, just hurry up.
There's a ton of these guys.

92
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,699
Okay, bye.

93
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,645
- Hope we can find a cab.
- There are lots of cabs.

94
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,732
- It's impossible this time of night.
- Hey, I know you.

95
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,942
- You're, uh...
- April O'Neil.

96
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,653
April O'Neil, yeah. The newslady.

97
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,907
So how are things
in the action-news biz?

98
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:14,701
- Pretty tiring, mostly.
- Well, honey, if you cut back...

99
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,579
...on the heavy aerobics
and all that jumping and yelling...

100
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,581
- It's all right.
- I find it disturbing.

101
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,459
- Here, let me get that for you.
- Oh. Oh, right.

102
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:26,588
Right. My aerobics. I'll do that.

103
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:28,882
- Bye.
- Good night, April.

104
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,926
- Was that necessary?
- I saw her on TV.

105
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,595
- A skirt walks by, all of a sudden...
- Will you stop?

106
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,909
Oh.

107
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,286
Michaelangelo.

108
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,878
Leonardo.

109
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,423
Donatello.

110
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,218
And Raphael.

111
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,597
The rat is the cleanest one.

112
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:26,606
Oh, yeah.
Woo-hoo.

113
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,609
Whoa, primo workout, dudes.

114
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:32,070
- Yeah.
- We showed those guys, huh?

115
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,655
- Muy primo, bros.
- Yeah.

116
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,198
Turtle-riffic.

117
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:38,326
Maximondo.

118
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,120
A cappella.

119
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,496
- Huh?
- Huh?

120
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,623
Uh, perestroika?

121
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:44,833
- Oh.
- Hmm.

122
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,002
Fr

123
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,839
Donny, give it up.

124
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,424
Aw.

125
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,511
- Hi, guys.
- Yo, April.

126
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,221
- Put it in. Yeah.
- Hey.

127
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,598
We brought dinner. Mwah.

128
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,182
- Let's eat.
- [IN NORMAL VOICE] Over here.

129
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,892
- Pizza.
- Yup.

130
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,102
- Again.
- Pepperoni.

131
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:08,023
- Please, please. A moment to reflect.
- Ah.

132
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,778
- Okay, a slice.
- Enjoy.

133
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,739
Ninja pizza.

134
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:17,365
Ninja pizza?

135
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:20,869
- Pizza that vanish quickly without trace.
- Ah.

136
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:24,164
- Here you go.
- Yo, Mikey, toss me a ninja slice.

137
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,374
- Donny, Statue of Liberty.
- Yeah.

138
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,917
- Come on, throw it.
- Go for it.

139
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,502
- Over here. Here.
- Mike, no.

140
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,046
- I'm right here.
- Please don't.

141
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:33,048
- He's at the 40. He's at the 20.
- Donny.

142
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,550
He looks. He rolls back.

143
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,720
- And he goes. He goes deep.
- Donatello, stop.

144
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,848
Aha. Touchdown. Yeah.

145
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,267
Yeah.

146
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:48,355
So any luck finding
a new place to live yet?

147
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:51,608
Well, you know, in this market
it's actually very difficult...

148
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,027
...to find good subterranean housing.

149
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:57,072
Hey, we could always go back
to the old sewer den.

150
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,991
- Well...
- Oh, yeah. Right, Raph.

151
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,201
It's a little tough...

152
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,871
...when about 500 members
of the Foot Clan know where you live.

153
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,165
- He's right.
- What? We kicked their butts.

154
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,667
They're all in jail.

155
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,169
Besides, we took out the Shredder...

156
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,755
...so what's everybody
so worried about anyway?

157
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:17,092
- He's right.
- No, Splinter took out the Shredder.

158
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:19,678
- They're both right.
- Yeah, yeah.

159
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,638
I was there, Leo. Remember?

160
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:25,600
Old Shred did a swan dive
with a half gainer...

161
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,103
...right into the back of a garbage truck.

162
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,439
Raphael.

163
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,066
Come away from there.

164
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:37,529
- Jeez, I was just...
- Never forget who you are.

165
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:38,947
You are ninja.

166
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:43,034
You must always practice
the art of invisibility.

167
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,244
- Yeah.
- All of you.

168
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,454
- Yeah.
- Well, I don't get it.

169
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,039
I mean, why?

170
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,791
We saved the city.

171
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,501
Why can't we just go out and...

172
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:56,214
Stand before me, my sons.

173
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:07,475
For 15 years,
you have been confined below.

174
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:12,272
Now the outside world
beckons your teenage minds.

175
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,481
- Yeah.
- Mm-hm. Yeah.

176
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:16,484
But they could never understand.

177
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:20,155
Their world can never be ours.

178
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:21,990
Uh...

179
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,909
Not even pizza?

180
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,789
Pizza's okay.

181
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,667
Ah. Man, give a guy a heart attack.

182
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,671
Here, let me get you guys some napkins.

183
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,631
- What for?
- What for?

184
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,803
Take heart, child.

185
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,389
We will not be here much longer.

186
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:47,849
Oh, no, no.

187
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,018
You guys can stay here
as long as you want.

188
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,519
- All right.
- Oh, gee. Thanks.

189
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:54,856
No. We do not belong here, above.

190
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:58,026
- Oh, man.
- Yes, Master Splinter.

191
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,153
Yes, Master Splinter.

192
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,404
What?

193
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:04,783
- What?
- Hey. Ten flips now.

194
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,035
- Go.
- Ridiculous.

195
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,662
Kids.

196
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,042
- One.
- One.

197
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,211
Such energy is wasted.

198
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,420
Two.

199
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:22,175
Remember, the true ninja
is a master of all things.

200
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,384
Three.

201
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:28,556
A master of his environment,
a master of himself.

202
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:32,602
Focus your thoughts
on where we must go...

203
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:36,606
...and leave the Shredder buried.

204
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,441
Seven.

205
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,030
Go.

206
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,786
Come on.

207
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,085
Is this it?

208
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,880
Everyone else must've been picked up.

209
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,591
Well, maybe they didn't find us.

210
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:48,720
Hey, we all knew the junkyard
was our fallback spot.

211
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,850
Our father gone.

212
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,730
They will pay.

213
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:04,319
I, Tatsu, now lead.

214
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:08,823
Let any who challenge step forward.

215
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,160
I challenge.

216
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:18,499
His face.

217
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:23,129
Master Shredder.

218
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:30,136
Choose the best man
from those that remain...

219
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,305
...to follow the reporter.

220
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:37,477
She is the key
to finding the creatures that did this to me.

221
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,937
Yes, master.

222
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,689
Next, master, we rebuild the Foot?

223
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,858
No.

224
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:47,403
There is only one thing next.

225
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:50,198
Revenge.

226
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,867
And in this day and age
of ecological abuse...

227
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:56,037
...it's nice to find a company
that's doing something to help.

228
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,873
Joining me on the final day
of their cleanup efforts...

229
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:04,712
...is Techno-Global Research Industries
spokesman Professor Jordan Perry.

230
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,340
Excuse me, professor?

231
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,634
Good afternoon.

232
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,220
Afternoon, Miss O'Neil.

233
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:16,808
Professor, perhaps you could tell us
why TGRI has finally decided...

234
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,644
...to clean up the waste
it's been burying here for years.

235
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,938
Would you like me
to keep my answer succinct...

236
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,315
...or will you edit
in case I start to ramble...

237
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,109
...which I'm in the habit of doing.

238
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,736
Professor, we're live.

239
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,823
Oh, right, well, yes.

240
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,659
Uh, our organization
has always been concerned...

241
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,911
...with the welfare
of the community we serve.

242
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,498
- Indeed, TGRI is...
- Man, who is this spasmatic?

243
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,419
Would you give the guy a break?
He's a scientist.

244
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:48,339
Yeah, fascinating. Hey, isn't Oprah on?

245
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,009
Raph, just leave it.

246
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:54,095
We're watching April. Sheesh.

247
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:03,813
- And dispose of them
in an ecologically more suitable way.

248
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:07,150
Hey, Mike,
do you think you can crunch any louder?

249
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,527
I can still hear out of this one.

250
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,994
Eh... Eh... Ugh...

251
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,621
Come on, let's change this.

252
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:23,958
Hey, maybe somebody's got something
on our fight last night.

253
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,376
Raphael...

254
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,503
...do not change channel.

255
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,630
Reporting live
from Bayonne, New Jersey...

256
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,008
...this is April O'Neil,
Channel Three News.

257
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,260
- Back to you.
- And that's it. We're off.

258
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:37,096
- Great. Thank you.
- Move it back.

259
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:40,767
Professor, would you mind
if I asked you a few follow-up questions?

260
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:41,976
Not at all.

261
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:45,104
Oh, drat. You know,
we're gonna have to do it another time.

262
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,648
It's been a great pleasure meeting you,
Miss O'Neil.

263
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,485
All press members must now clear the area.

264
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,987
Okay, great.

265
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:56,074
Report back at 3:00, okay?

266
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:59,202
- Enjoying your first day, Freddy?
- Yeah.

267
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,120
Hey, what were you gonna ask him?

268
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:04,207
Well, I don't know.

269
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:07,627
Don't worry about it.
I'm paid to be suspicious.

270
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:11,923
- Come on, come on.
- Oh, yeah. Sorry.

271
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:19,347
All non-TGRI employees
must now vacate the area.

272
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,349
Here.

273
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,979
How could you have missed this?

274
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,940
I don't know.

275
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,651
Grab some men.
I'll go find the professor.

276
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,362
We've got to take care of this now.

277
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,531
- Go.
- Right. Right.

278
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:44,539
All members of the press must
return their visitor badges at the main gate.

279
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,514
Dandelions?

280
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,771
Move it back.

281
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,443
No, if the soil is contaminated
so far away...

282
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:17,113
...there must be more leaky
canisters than we thought.

283
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:20,575
- But how? They were buried 15 years ago.
- Fifteen, 50.

284
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:23,369
Just make sure the rest
are found and removed.

285
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,746
Maybe it wasrt a good idea
to invite the press.

286
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:29,167
Sometimes the best way to hide
is right out in public.

287
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,086
If any of it fell into the wrong hands...

288
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,338
I'm well aware of the risks.

289
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,925
Containment team to Sector 3.

290
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:45,099
This is not the reason
I sent you to follow her.

291
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:48,102
- No, master, but I thought...
- Silence.

292
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,940
This may be even better.

293
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:58,279
Whatever caused this mutation
may be useful against my enemies.

294
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:02,450
Tatsu, gather your best men.

295
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:05,411
You have a mission tonight.

296
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,927
Mwah.

297
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,771
Hey, guys. Check this.

298
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,315
Wax on, wax off.

299
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,443
- Wax on...
- Mouth off.

300
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,153
Hey, everyone's a critic.

301
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,321
Hello?

302
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,323
Oh, man.

303
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,617
Oh, April, you spoiled our surprise.

304
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,410
We were gonna clean everything up.

305
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,663
Thanks, guys.

306
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:50,498
Where's Splinter?

307
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,793
He's been up on the roof
ever since he saw your report.

308
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,129
Really? Doing what?

309
00:20:57,297 --> 00:21:00,675
Coming to a decision.

310
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,762
You've been meditating many hours,
Master Splinter.

311
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,515
Yes, and it is time.

312
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,267
Join me above.

313
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,020
Maybe you better hear
what he has to say.

314
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:20,319
These last hours have been spent
pondering many questions.

315
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:26,117
Some are the very questions
of our origin.

316
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:27,827
The sewer.

317
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,454
Our transformation.

318
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:36,711
But the answers
have always remained hidden in the past.

319
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:42,383
Veiled by a shadow
too deep to penetrate...

320
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,385
...until now.

321
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:53,561
A light from the present reaches back
to illuminate that shadow.

322
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:58,899
You have never seen this,
but know what it is.

323
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,569
That's the canister that had the ooze.

324
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:04,238
That transformed us all.

325
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:07,742
I have kept it these 15 years.

326
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:12,246
But why do you only show us now,
Master Splinter?

327
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,918
TGRI.

328
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:21,005
The interview today. I knew it.

329
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,924
I knew there was something else
going on with those guys.

330
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:27,386
Yes, and we must know what.

331
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:31,515
For if the contents of this canister
were not unique...

332
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:36,562
...the city may now face grave danger.

333
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,106
After all these years.

334
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:46,280
- After all this time wondering who we are.
- The past returns, my son.

335
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,659
It is time...

336
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:54,080
...to seek our answers.

337
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:30,282
Disposed.

338
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:38,582
Well, you're the last one, aren't you?

339
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,924
- Come on, guys.
- I love this spy stuff.

340
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,801
Oh, yeah.

341
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:56,016
- Not much to this place.
- Nah.

342
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:57,226
Donny.

343
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:01,605
It doesn't look like there's any
night security, but we better move in quiet.

344
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,858
- Yeah.
- Come on, Leo.

345
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:05,526
What do you say?

346
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,987
Let's do it, eh?

347
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:11,157
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it. Heh-heh.

348
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,869
- Whoa, Times Square City.
- I don't believe it.

349
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:18,622
Like video games in 3-D.
Totally massive.

350
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,543
Whoa. Would you get
a load of this crazy joint.

351
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,211
The past returns.

352
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,547
I knew we'd find something special.

353
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,175
I'll say, special. Look at this.

354
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:32,887
- Hey, where do you put the quarter?
- Mike, will you just stop messing around?

355
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:36,223
- Yeah, but...
- Hey, guys, over there.

356
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,225
Yeah.

357
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:46,400
- What do you make of it, Donny?
- Well, I'm not sure.

358
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,652
Looks like just a bunch of serial numbers.

359
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,237
Let's see.

360
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:55,409
"Disposed."

361
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,870
Hey, dudes, we're too late.

362
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:00,414
Like no deposit, no return.

363
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:03,417
Well, except maybe this one.

364
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:06,837
- What do you mean?
- Look.

365
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,757
- "Active."
- Yeah.

366
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,342
Can you bring up the file?

367
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:14,136
Well, I could try...

368
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:17,765
...but if the database is coded,
the whole system might go down.

369
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:20,935
- Do it.
- Okay.

370
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:22,394
Yeah.

371
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,116
- Aw. Drat.
- Drag.

372
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:39,411
Hey. No, no, no. We're so close.

373
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,540
Gosh.

374
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,208
- What?
- The Foot.

375
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,381
He's got the canister.

376
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,758
- Get it.
- I got it.

377
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,218
Uh...

378
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:59,098
Whoa, ha, ha. Yeah.

379
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,900
Donny. Donny.

380
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,236
Go, go, go.

381
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,380
Whoa, whoa. Uh-oh.

382
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:32,590
Hey, Mikey.

383
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,426
- Throw it over here.
- Go long. Go long.

384
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:38,095
Downfield. Turtle in the open.

385
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:45,144
One, two, three, punt.

386
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,689
Aha.

387
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:54,236
Hey, guys, huddle, huddle.
Come here. Come on.

388
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:57,197
Mikey, you go up the middle.
You guys take the sides. Get it?

389
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:58,657
- Got it.
- Good.

390
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:01,118
- I don't get it.
- Ready?

391
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,870
Break.

392
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,552
Get it.

393
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:19,845
Ha, ha.

394
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,853
Hey, Mikey, surf's up, dude. Ha-ha.

395
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,733
Wipe out.

396
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:38,197
Ninja, vanish.

397
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,910
Oh, you have gotta be kidding.

398
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,248
Oh, great.

399
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:52,169
Terrific.

400
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,590
Wonderful.

401
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,346
- Bummer.
- Oh, man.

402
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:08,227
And this was the only one?

403
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:15,651
Then it's time to find out
exactly what this ooze can do.

404
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,862
Isn't it, professor?

405
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:24,076
We'll find a home soon, Paulina,
and then it'll be just you and me.

406
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,203
Now, look, we've all talked about it.

407
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,789
We've decided to do it
and that's all there is to it.

408
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,290
But I don't understand.

409
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:33,001
You guys haven't even found
a new place to live yet.

410
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:37,464
Listen, April, it's too dangerous to stay here
with you when the Foot are out there.

411
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:39,174
They might be looking for us.

412
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:42,136
Well, you know, we could go
looking for them for a change.

413
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:44,012
I mean, they got the ooze, Leo.

414
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,598
Hey, first we move, then we look.

415
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:49,393
I don't know about you guys,
but I could really go for a slice of...

416
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,646
- Pizza.
- Huh? Whoa.

417
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:55,983
- Spookular.
- Miss O'Neil?

418
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:57,651
Uh...

419
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:58,902
No.

420
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:03,073
Wait. I'll be right there.

421
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:07,703
Uh...

422
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,246
What?

423
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:12,124
I didn't order any pizza.

424
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:13,917
Oh, I know.

425
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:18,172
But the guy in 313 did,
and now he doesn't seem to be there.

426
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,633
I figured since you order
so much anyway...

427
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,844
...that, you know, maybe you...

428
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,347
Where'd these come from?

429
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:28,849
Those...

430
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,809
...are mine.

431
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:32,227
Yeah.

432
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:37,524
L... I like to do a little chucking
every now and then.

433
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,365
Yeah. I'd keep practicing.

434
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:48,952
You know, on second thought,
why don't I take this pizza anyway?

435
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,537
I mean, I can always use more.

436
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:52,956
- Let me get my wallet.
- No, no, no.

437
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,375
- Yes, please.
- That's okay. Don't worry about it.

438
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:58,170
One last thing, though. I thought
you might wanna know about this.

439
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,379
Ow! Ooh, ooh.

440
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:01,048
- You guys.
- Hey.

441
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,050
- What's the big idea?
- Can I hurt him?

442
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:05,511
- Please? Tell me I can hurt him.
- That's not nice.

443
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:08,388
- Hold on. Take it easy.
- Please, please?

444
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:14,978
I think you'd better sit down.

445
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:29,910
And with an old Renaissance art book
I found in a storm drain...

446
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:32,412
...I gave them all names.

447
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,997
Yeah.

448
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,377
I'm Leonardo.

449
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,504
I'm Michaelangelo.

450
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,799
Donatello.

451
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,634
I'm Raphael.

452
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:48,762
Yeah, all the good ones end in O.

453
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,013
Hey. Hey.

454
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:53,058
- Michaelangelo.
- Yeah?

455
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:54,935
Go.

456
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:56,937
All right.

457
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,648
I can't believe every time...

458
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,777
One.

459
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:07,614
- Two.
- So basically, what you're telling me...

460
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:11,034
...is you guys were all, heh, slimed.
Three.

461
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,453
It wasrt slime.

462
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:16,456
It was ooze.
And there's more of it out there.

463
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,792
- Where?
- Well, we're not sure.

464
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,461
See, there's this sort of clan
of ninja thieves.

465
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,714
A really secret group.
They call themselves...

466
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,173
- The Foot?
- Huh?

467
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,551
- You've heard of them?
- Yeah. The word is out...

468
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:31,513
...that these guys are looking for anybody
they can find with martial arts talent.

469
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:32,973
Especially teenagers.

470
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,267
- Hey.
- Ten.

471
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:39,980
And if I let myself get recruited,
guess what that might lead us to?

472
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,857
No way, Keno.

473
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:44,318
- Forget about it.
- Hey.

474
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:47,905
And believe me, I really hate to say this,
but the kid's got a...

475
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,156
No.

476
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,449
- Why not?
- Why not?

477
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:53,076
- Too dangerous.
- Seventeen.

478
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,329
- Uh, but I thought we could...
- No.

479
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,581
- Aw.
- Nineteen.

480
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,834
- Oh, man.
- Twenty.

481
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:04,463
Twenty-one, twenty...

482
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,175
Uh, heh, heh.

483
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:10,844
One? Yeah.

484
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:22,272
And these are the two
most vicious animals you could find?

485
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,316
Good.

486
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,860
- Professor?
- Preparations are complete, however...

487
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,695
- Begin.
- However, I feel compelled...

488
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:32,366
...to reregister my formal protest
and remind you of the immense danger...

489
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,996
That's enough talk from me.

490
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,790
We'll begin.

491
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,740
Yes.

492
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:20,872
Clear.

493
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,582
Go, go. Move.

494
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:32,467
- See you, April.
- Bye.

495
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:35,929
Wish us luck.

496
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:42,936
We'll be back for Splinter.

497
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,231
The lives of two people...

498
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,525
...don't amount to
a hill of beans in this crazy world.

499
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:51,486
That's why you're getting on that plane.
Maybe not today...

500
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:53,071
Would you stop.

501
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,116
See ya.

502
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,632
Gah.

503
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:15,010
All right, hold it.

504
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,386
This is stupid.

505
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,638
We got the Foot up there
with the ooze...

506
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:21,016
...and we're down here
playing Century 21.

507
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,435
- Raph.
- Come on, Leo.

508
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,812
Even you could think
of something better to do.

509
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,064
I already have.

510
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,440
- Now, let's get going.
- Yeah.

511
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:31,568
Uh-uh. That's it. I'm going up.

512
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,987
No, you're not.

513
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:35,614
Let go of my arm, Leo.

514
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:38,033
Guys, guys, guys.

515
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,659
I just got an idea.

516
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:42,537
Two words that could solve

517
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:45,165
- Time-share.
- Oh.

518
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,501
Hmm. Not quite ripe yet.

519
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:49,503
I'm out of here.

520
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,838
But... Oh, man.

521
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,674
Oh, boy.

522
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:58,470
- Come on.
- Yeah.

523
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:02,015
You know, you'd think
finding a new place would be easy.

524
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,183
But no.

525
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,894
You'd think even an idiot
could find a place down here.

526
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,354
But no...

527
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,356
Whoa!

528
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:12,025
- Oh, no.
- Mikey, buddy.

529
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,237
- Mikey. Mikey, are you okay, huh?
- Mike? Mikey?

530
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:17,697
Check it out.

531
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:20,742
Yeah.

532
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,829
- Okay, bro? Come on, Leo.
- Yeah.

533
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,623
- You all right?
- No prob.

534
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,376
- Coolness.
- Huh?

535
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:34,256
Hmm. Uh-huh.

536
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,051
- Power.
- Yeah.

537
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,636
Yeah.

538
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:45,725
- Whoa.
- Oh, yech. Yuck.

539
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:50,981
- Look.
- I don't believe this.

540
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:53,275
Yes.

541
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:55,569
- Yes, yes.
- Yeah.

542
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,657
It's like spider city.

543
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,409
Great.

544
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:05,203
Rock-a-bye, baby.

545
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,998
It's roomy.

546
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,333
And it's well hidden, huh?

547
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,626
So, what do you think?

548
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:18,091
You know, I hear the sewers
in Connecticut are really nice.

549
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,551
Yeah. Come on.

550
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,760
This is great.

551
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:28,226
How much longer?

552
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:30,770
Look, I told you, I don't know.

553
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,856
It takes time. Days.

554
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:36,109
I want them as soon as possible.

555
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,820
- I told...
- Sit down.

556
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,865
Arert these enough for your vengeance?

557
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:45,243
The Foot
have already failed against them.

558
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:47,454
I have failed.

559
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:53,335
But the next time will be different.

560
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,712
The next fight...

561
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:00,133
...will be freak against freak.

562
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:06,932
April. April, will you listen
just for a minute?

563
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:08,808
It's a ratings week.

564
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:12,437
Phil, I told you.
I am following up on TGRI.

565
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,814
There's more going on there
than we know.

566
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:18,193
Look, that story is over.
We need something solid.

567
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,447
Something fresh.
I mean, like... Like this.

568
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,658
Um, she's busy right now.

569
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:27,827
"Looking ahead. Swimsuits in the '90s"?

570
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,162
My interest is peaked.

571
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,873
Phil, I gotta get going.

572
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,042
You are always so busy.

573
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,170
I mean,
I'm the news manager here, April.

574
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,881
April, there's a call for you.

575
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,510
Tell them I'll call them back.

576
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:46,930
He sounds pretty insistent.
Says his name's Donny.

577
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:50,809
Listen, you can tell Donny that she's busy
with her news manager right now...

578
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,644
...and that she can't...

579
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,523
- Donny?
- April.

580
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:59,985
Where are you guys?
Did you find a place to live yet?

581
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,696
Oh, yeah, but l...

582
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:06,283
It's not much right now,
but we'll bring you down.

583
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:10,120
We've only really had time to get Splinter
and pick up a few essentials.

584
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:13,039
Yeah, the bare essentials.

585
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:18,253
Look, the reason why we're calling is
have you seen Raphael by any chance?

586
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:19,462
Raphael?

587
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:24,509
- Yeah. Has he stopped by or anything?
- No. Why? Is he missing?

588
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:29,556
You know, there's still a little more stuff
to help with, Michaelangelo.

589
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:32,225
Hey, I'm helping Donny.
Give me the phone.

590
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:33,518
Hey, give me that.

591
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:36,730
- I want the... Aah.
- So you haven't seen him at all then, huh?

592
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:38,982
- No, I haven't see him.
- Yeah, if she does...

593
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:43,069
...tell him thanks for wasting our time.
Because instead of going out looking...

594
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:45,780
...for the Foot and the ooze
like we should...

595
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:48,450
...we gotta go out
and look for him instead.

596
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,578
What was that?

597
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,622
Leo says hi.

598
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:56,750
Hey, give me the phone.

599
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:58,335
If you hear something let us know.

600
00:38:58,502 --> 00:38:59,711
I wanna talk. It's important.

601
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:00,920
No. No.

602
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:03,340
- Give me, give me, give me.
- All right, here.

603
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,091
April, it's Mikey.

604
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:06,468
I'd just like to say...

605
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:07,969
...hello. Mwah, mwah, mwah.

606
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,596
Would you give me that?

607
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:12,766
No, I won't give it back.
Please, please, please.

608
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:18,355
The cells will no longer hold them.

609
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,067
Remove the bar.

610
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:24,944
It's time they learn who their master is.

611
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:30,658
Remove the bar and leave us.

612
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,585
Come forth.

613
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,597
Wolf. Snapping turtle.

614
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:54,849
Incredible.

615
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:58,144
Yes. Come forward.

616
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,897
Attack me, if you will.

617
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:04,567
When it is over,
you will call me master.

618
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,072
Ma...

619
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,659
Ma...

620
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:15,745
Mama?

621
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:19,791
- Oh, Mama.
- Mama.

622
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:22,210
Oh, Mama.

623
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:25,088
Get off me.

624
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,676
Babies.

625
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,887
They're babies.

626
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:38,059
What did you expect?
They come out quoting Macbeth?

627
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:40,728
- They are stupid.
- Well, they're not stupid.

628
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,897
They're infants.

629
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:45,150
- Bang.
- Ow.

630
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:48,027
Okay, they're stupid infants.

631
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:52,157
Put that down.

632
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:55,452
Huh? Aw.

633
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:59,789
Fortunately, they seem to have imprinted
you as their surrogate mother.

634
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:00,999
Mama.

635
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,710
They are of no use to me against a...

636
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,336
Tatsu.

637
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:11,134
See that these two things
are properly disposed of.

638
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:14,387
No, no, you can't do that.
They're living creatures.

639
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,514
Not for long.

640
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:19,017
Hey, no, no. Wait, look.

641
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:25,565
They may be intellectually inferior, but...

642
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:33,573
As you can see,
they do have other attributes.

643
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:41,164
Maybe I'll keep them around after all.

644
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,800
- Hey, man, how's it going?
- Pretty good.

645
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:54,552
- Hey, good to see you, man.
- Yeah.

646
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,429
What's up?

647
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:58,890
How'd you get here?

648
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:01,184
Okay, guys.

649
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,144
Listen up.

650
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:06,397
I'm only gonna tell you once.

651
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:10,944
All you guys is gonna have
to take a little test.

652
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:16,241
Then if you're good enough,
we let you into the organization.

653
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:17,784
- Right.
- Okay.

654
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:20,036
Any questions?

655
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:23,790
Okay, follow me.

656
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:38,179
I knew this would work.

657
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:41,891
Just remember, we get you in,
we find the Foot headquarters...

658
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,477
...we get you out
to tell the others, right?

659
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:47,230
Gee, maybe I should write this down.

660
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,940
What?

661
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,818
I'm being punished, aren't I?

662
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,489
Yeah.

663
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:58,658
- Go!
- Go!

664
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:02,954
Yeah!

665
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:18,303
Good job, man.

666
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,350
Yeah!

667
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:28,479
- Get up!
- Come on!

668
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,983
Yeah!

669
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,445
- Come on, man! Get up, man!
- Yo, man, get up.

670
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,906
- Come on!
- Get up, man! Come on!

671
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:40,992
- Keno, wasrt it?
- Yeah.

672
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,494
You seem to be the only one won'thy
of a final test.

673
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:45,038
You okay?

674
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:49,667
You'll have 15 seconds to remove
as many of the bells as you can.

675
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:52,378
- One sound and you fail.
- No way.

676
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:54,047
Oh, and another thing...

677
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:55,965
...we work in concealment.

678
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,009
Fifteen seconds.

679
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,719
Go.

680
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,943
Man, you see that?
He's gonna be one of them.

681
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:17,570
- Yeah.
- Is this enough?

682
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:20,823
Where do you think this guy from?
I never seen nothing like that.

683
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,575
Yeah.

684
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:25,495
All right.

685
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,955
Welcome to our headquarters.

686
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,210
Get yourself a training doggy
and meet me back in the yard.

687
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:34,253
Yeah, all right.

688
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:38,508
- Where is it?
- Hey.

689
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,641
Psst. Keno, come on.

690
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,897
Okay, looks like this is the place.

691
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:55,566
Yeah, looks like it.

692
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:02,782
Okay, first chance we get,
we're out of here. Huh?

693
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,951
What? What is it?

694
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:09,622
I thought I just saw a ghost.

695
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:12,208
- What?
- Come on.

696
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:16,796
- So just what are we looking for anyway?
- Quiet. You wanna get us...?

697
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,466
Caught?

698
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:22,343
Yeah, well, uh...

699
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:28,099
Hi, uh, we were looking for a muffler
for a '77 Chevy.

700
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:33,271
Jeez, whatever happened
to service with a smile?

701
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:36,983
Yeah.

702
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:39,152
Raph.

703
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:41,821
Out of my way!

704
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:45,658
Get out of here, kid.
Go and tell the others. Go, now.

705
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:47,827
Hey, nice shot.

706
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:48,995
You're good.

707
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:50,747
Come on.

708
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,668
- I'm not gonna just...
- Run or I'll kick your butt.

709
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:58,212
Just turn around again!

710
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:00,840
Move.

711
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,508
Come on, you guys.

712
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:13,978
- Excuse me. Pardon me.
- Watch him!

713
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:17,648
Come on.

714
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:19,901
Missed.

715
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:23,696
- I got him.
- I'm curious.

716
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:27,950
Any of you guys ever heard
the expression "fair fight"?

717
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:29,786
Pull him up.

718
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:33,164
You know, pal,
if I had a face like yours...

719
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:37,627
...l'd try to make up for it
with some sort of a personality.

720
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:40,880
Shredder.

721
00:46:55,771 --> 00:47:00,066
Come on. Come on. April! Leo!

722
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:02,235
If you're there, it's me, Keno!

723
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:04,570
Oh, Don. Come on.

724
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:06,739
Raph's in trouble!

725
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:09,408
- Mike, April!
- Keno?

726
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:11,577
- April, where are they?
- Wait...

727
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:14,247
- It's Raph.
- Calm down. Slow down. What happened?

728
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:16,415
I gotta tell the guys. They got him.

729
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:18,835
Who has got him?

730
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:30,179
Come on.

731
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:34,392
- Just like Keno said.
- Yeah.

732
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:39,438
- The perimeter's quiet.
- Yeah, a little too quiet.

733
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:42,066
- Come on.
- Okay.

734
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:56,706
Knock, knock.

735
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:01,627
Well, that was easy.

736
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:04,964
- Yeah, a little too easy.
- Yeah.

737
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:10,970
Look, it's Raph.

738
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,307
Yeah, a little too Raph.

739
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:16,183
- You guys, knock it off.
- Oh, brother.

740
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:18,144
Keep your eyes peeled.

741
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:20,271
- I don't like this.
- No.

742
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:21,814
- Let's go.
- Right.

743
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:28,237
Hey.

744
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:33,743
- Whoo.
- Aha.

745
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:34,994
- Oh.
- Huh?

746
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:39,999
You know, given the layout of this junkyard
and the proximity of certain structures...

747
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:45,588
...if they were gonna spring a trap,
they'd probably do it right about...

748
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:49,008
Whoa!

749
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:51,510
Let us out of here.

750
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,347
What the...?

751
00:48:58,393 --> 00:48:59,852
- The Shred dude.
- Oh, no.

752
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,270
It's him.

753
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:03,898
I've been waiting for you.

754
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:07,026
I have a little surprise.

755
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:11,364
- Oh, no.
- I don't like this.

756
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:13,282
I don't like this.

757
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,368
I wonder what those are for.

758
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:18,245
Does the word "turtle kebab"
mean anything to you?

759
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:20,081
Yeah, right.

760
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:21,999
Get your arm out of my face.

761
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:26,295
Patience.

762
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:31,550
First them, then you.

763
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:35,179
You know,
these nets are remarkably effective.

764
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:37,473
- Very well constructed.
- Yeah.

765
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:40,726
Remind me to drop a line to Ralph Nader.

766
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:44,063
Wait for my signal to drop them.

767
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,901
I never got to see Paris.

768
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:50,903
A little closer.

769
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:54,407
A little closer.

770
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:58,327
We're almost there.

771
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:00,079
Get ready.

772
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,540
This is it.

773
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:10,089
Cowabunga.

774
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:14,051
That's right, Shredder.
You forgot. We carry insurance.

775
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:15,720
Yeah, mutual of Splinter, dude.

776
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:16,929
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

777
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:19,640
Get them.

778
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:35,614
Jeez, why don't you just rip my lips off?

779
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:38,284
You'd think...?

780
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:41,037
Here, let me get this first.

781
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,134
Can we talk?

782
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:57,386
Guess not.

783
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:01,474
Pitiful.

784
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:11,817
You win.

785
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:16,739
Looks like we're on our own.

786
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:18,115
- All right.
- Yeah.

787
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:20,326
Tokka.

788
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:22,661
Rahzar.

789
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:29,168
Gross.

790
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:36,592
Didrt we see these guys
on WrestleMania?

791
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,511
Prove yourselves to me.

792
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:40,346
Attack.

793
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:46,977
The bigger they are...

794
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:52,274
The more bones they break.

795
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:56,779
- Yeah.
- Okay, these guys are mine.

796
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,697
Go get them, Donny.

797
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:03,410
All right, you overgrown,
ugly excuse for a turtle.

798
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:14,505
You know, maybe that "ugly" crack
was a little bit out of line, huh?

799
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:23,556
Oh, that hurt.

800
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:30,020
Hey, you're that TGRI guy.

801
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:31,939
Hang on.

802
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:37,570
- I've gotta get the hang of that.
- No, it's okay.

803
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,656
I'm gonna get you out of here.

804
00:52:57,924 --> 00:52:59,383
What?

805
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:03,470
Oh, am I glad to see you.

806
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:06,223
Mwah. Pfft, pfft.

807
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:08,309
Hey, guys, over here.

808
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:11,520
Yeah. We're on our way.

809
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:15,274
Come on. Come on, professor.
We don't have a lot of time.

810
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:17,985
Hey. Hey, Mikey, we got the TGRI guy.

811
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:20,487
Come on, come on, come on, yeah.

812
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:23,115
- Well, yes. Well, actually, I'd rather not.
- Come on.

813
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:25,492
- Come on.
- Yeah.

814
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:29,747
- Step up to the bar, boys.
- Limbo, limbo, limbo.

815
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:34,376
This way, Leo. Come on.

816
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:36,587
You all right, doc?

817
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:37,963
Way to go, Mikey.

818
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:39,173
- Come on.
- Come on.

819
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:41,800
- Hey, you go next.
- Come here.

820
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:45,221
- Come on, Raph.
- Yeah, yeah.

821
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:48,599
Stop them.

822
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:55,105
- Drop right in, Leo.
- Yeah.

823
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:56,315
- All right.
- Yeah.

824
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:12,665
Hey, look at this.

825
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:19,255
Coochy-coo.

826
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:23,968
Oh. Stupid.

827
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:25,552
Coochy-coochy-coo.

828
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,263
- Ow.
- Come on.

829
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:30,808
- We gotta meet back up with Splinter.
- Yeah.

830
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:38,190
Four walking, talking turtles.

831
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:43,195
Yeah, the guy's Ph.D. Material, all right.

832
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:45,531
And so intelligent, it's incredible.

833
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:49,660
Hey, don't freak, dude.
We can explain. You see...

834
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:52,037
Fifteen years ago,
you came into contact...

835
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:54,373
...with a green colloidal gel
down in a sewer...

836
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:57,543
...which transformed you
into your present state.

837
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:00,546
Fantastic.

838
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:02,381
There you go.

839
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:05,551
- Come on. Yeah.
- Amazing, guys.

840
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:09,138
And I thought all the really good dungeons
were in Europe.

841
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:11,682
There you go, dude.

842
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:16,020
This is wonderful.

843
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:17,229
Yeah, okay.

844
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:21,108
We'll give you the tour later,
but right now we've got a few questions.

845
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:25,946
- Yeah, a few inquiries.
- Yeah, yeah, a few, uh...

846
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:27,448
We'll give you a tour later.

847
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:29,658
Give him room to speak.

848
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:35,080
The professor has much to tell us.

849
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,965
Of course,
laboratories were crude back then...

850
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:47,676
...and an accident
was just waiting to happen.

851
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:50,387
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

852
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:55,601
You mean to tell us that the formation
of the ooze was all just a big mistake?

853
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:57,644
Well, let me see.

854
00:55:57,812 --> 00:55:59,938
Donatello, isn't it?

855
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:03,400
An unknown mixture
of discarded chemicals...

856
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:07,196
...was accidentally exposed
to a series of radiated waves...

857
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:10,866
...and the resulting ooze, as you put it,
was found to have remarkable...

858
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:14,453
...but dangerous mutanagenic properties.

859
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:16,121
Eh?

860
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:18,791
- Big mistake.
- Oh.

861
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:25,381
- Please continue, professor.
- Yeah.

862
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:28,300
Well, on our way to bury them,
a near-collision caused us...

863
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:32,805
...to lose one of the canisters
down a sewer 15 years ago.

864
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:36,725
Professor Perry,
what's happening at TGRI now?

865
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:39,561
They're trying to remove any evidence...

866
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:42,272
...of the disposal process
and evacuate the premises...

867
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:45,234
...which is standard procedure
when a mishap occurs.

868
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:50,906
And as we know, Leonardo, one or two
rather big mishaps have occurred.

869
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:54,493
Yeah, Tokka, Rahzar and the Shredder.

870
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:57,913
And he's obsessed with the idea
of destroying you all.

871
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:00,874
Yeah, we got that impression, all right.

872
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:02,126
- Michaelangelo.
- Yeah?

873
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:05,170
- Show the professor where he may rest.
- Righty-o.

874
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:08,173
This way, dude.

875
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:10,384
It ain't the Hilton.

876
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:15,764
Let's face it,
you'd be better off staying at the Hilton.

877
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:25,816
What troubles you, my son?

878
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,528
I don't know.

879
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:32,406
I just always thought
there'd be more to it...

880
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:33,824
...to the ooze...

881
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:37,035
...to, you know, us.

882
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:38,996
I know.

883
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:43,292
I always thought
there'd be something, that...

884
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:46,545
I thought we'd find out we were special.

885
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:53,260
Do not confuse the specter of your origin
with your present won'th, my sons.

886
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:57,723
I don't believe him.
There's just got to be more to it.

887
00:57:57,891 --> 00:58:04,730
Perhaps the search for a beginning
rarely has so easy an end.

888
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:07,900
But our search will have to wait.

889
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:11,737
Tonight's encounter has left us with...

890
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,781
...larger problems.

891
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,871
I got it.

892
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:30,047
Go. Play.

893
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:32,090
Have fun.

894
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:34,259
Fun.

895
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:41,642
Tonight, we leave a calling card
for the turtles.

896
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:43,477
Tomorrow...

897
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:46,772
...we force a final confrontation.

898
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:15,968
- Master say, "Have fun."
- Fun.

899
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:20,305
Look, Sophie.

900
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:23,267
Some animals are knocking down
the telephone poles.

901
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:25,477
What do we do if they come over here?

902
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:28,522
Let them get their own cab.

903
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,160
Well, yeah, damage is minimal.

904
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:45,789
And as always,
our official report will be released...

905
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:47,708
...after a thorough investigation.

906
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:49,042
Thank you, Miss O'Neil.

907
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:54,715
I have no further comments at this time.
We will be in touch.

908
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:56,508
More as it develops.

909
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:58,302
- Come on, keep going.
- Here you go.

910
00:59:58,469 --> 00:59:59,511
Chief.

911
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:03,599
Chief Sterns, I wonder if I might ask you
a few more questions off-the-record.

912
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:06,018
Miss O'Neil, my record, on-the-record...

913
01:00:06,185 --> 01:00:09,062
...clearly shows
that I have no off-the-record record.

914
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:11,273
- Make a record of that.
- Oh, wait.

915
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:17,029
Were there any large tooth
or claw marks found here today?

916
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:18,697
How did you know...?

917
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,366
That I don't know
what you're talking about?

918
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:26,079
Chief, I have reason to believe
that this damage was caused by two...

919
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:29,207
...really big animals.

920
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:32,294
And what type of animals
might these be, Miss O'Neil?

921
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:34,129
Well, I can't say exactly.

922
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:37,716
I see. Then what leads you
to believe they did this?

923
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:40,719
- Well, I can't say that either, but...
- Uh-huh.

924
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:43,722
Is there anything else
you'd like not to tell me, Miss O'Neil?

925
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:47,017
Sterns, there are two
very dangerous things out there.

926
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:50,646
And just what exactly
would you like me to do about it?

927
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:54,900
I don't know.

928
01:00:55,526 --> 01:00:58,403
I guess you're not the ones
that are gonna have to handle this.

929
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,240
That's what we do best, Miss O'Neil.

930
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:05,494
Have a nice day.

931
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:10,415
All right, get sanitation down here,
will you? Let's get this place cleaned up.

932
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:18,382
- Where's Freddy?
- Took off. Said he was sick.

933
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:19,841
- What do you need?
- Uh...

934
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:22,386
Nothing. I can get it.

935
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:40,070
Hello, April.

936
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:41,863
Freddy?

937
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:48,745
Our master has a message
for your friends.

938
01:01:50,998 --> 01:01:52,624
Okay.

939
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:58,004
We gotta go all the way up.

940
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:01,675
- Are you sure you werert...?
- They're not following me.

941
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:03,593
They don't need to.

942
01:02:03,761 --> 01:02:05,345
Good luck.

943
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:12,978
And they said if you don't meet them
at the construction site tonight...

944
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:15,480
What?

945
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:18,817
He'd send Tokka and Rahzar out again.

946
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:20,902
This time into Central Park.

947
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:22,195
Oh, man.

948
01:02:22,363 --> 01:02:23,780
Central Park?

949
01:02:23,948 --> 01:02:26,616
How are they going to avoid
all of those...

950
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:28,577
...people?

951
01:02:29,203 --> 01:02:32,456
Then there is no choice...

952
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:36,334
...but to meet as the Shredder wishes.

953
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:38,253
Okay.

954
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:41,757
He's just trying to force you guys
into fighting Tokka and Rahzar again.

955
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:43,300
- We know.
- But you can't...

956
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:45,802
April, there's no other way.

957
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:48,513
But you guys don't stand a chance.

958
01:02:48,681 --> 01:02:49,973
Wait.

959
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:52,642
Wait just a minute.

960
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:55,687
There might be a way.

961
01:02:59,066 --> 01:03:00,567
Temperature?

962
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:02,319
338 kelvin.

963
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:04,863
Michaelangelo,
pass me the dimethyl chlorinite, please.

964
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:07,199
- Heh?
- That.

965
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:10,660
Oh. You know,
not to criticize science or anything...

966
01:03:10,828 --> 01:03:13,872
...but wouldn't it be easier
just to call it the pink one?

967
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,416
Oh, Mikey.

968
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:20,879
Donatello, continue aeration.

969
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:22,547
Continuing aeration.

970
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:24,716
Okay.

971
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:27,886
Oh, man, this stuff is rank.

972
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:30,555
Yeah, try carrying it
on the subway sometime.

973
01:03:30,723 --> 01:03:32,724
I never got a seat so fast in my life.

974
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:34,226
Blech.

975
01:03:34,393 --> 01:03:36,561
Thanks for doing
all the shopping for us, Keno.

976
01:03:36,729 --> 01:03:40,065
No problem. I hope you guys didn't mind me
picking up a few pies.

977
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:43,485
You're forgiven. Whoa.

978
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:53,912
Are you sure this stuff will work?

979
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:57,415
When I contaminated the ooze
used to transform Tokka and Rahzar...

980
01:03:57,583 --> 01:04:00,335
...making them intellectually inferior
and less dangerous...

981
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:03,463
...I had no idea I'd be trying to formulate
an antimutagen...

982
01:04:03,631 --> 01:04:06,007
...based on that contamination.
- Oh.

983
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:08,093
Antimutagen.

984
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:09,970
- What?
- He's not sure.

985
01:04:10,137 --> 01:04:11,930
Oh.

986
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:15,600
Pepperoni heaven. Mmm.

987
01:04:15,768 --> 01:04:18,770
- Gentlemen, may I have your attention?
- Right this way.

988
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:22,023
- Leonardo, hand me a glass, please?
- Oh, yeah. Sure.

989
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:24,276
- Voil

990
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:26,444
Are you sure this stuff will do the trick?

991
01:04:26,612 --> 01:04:28,864
Well, we won't know
until we spray those guys.

992
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:30,991
- Yeah.
- Well, actually...

993
01:04:31,158 --> 01:04:32,826
Actually, what?

994
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:34,953
Actually...

995
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:38,039
...ingestion is the only course.

996
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:39,666
What?

997
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:41,251
You mean, they have to eat it?

998
01:04:42,336 --> 01:04:43,545
Affirmative.

999
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:44,754
Yes.

1000
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:47,215
Yo, right on, my man.

1001
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:50,302
Oh, great. That should be easy.

1002
01:04:50,469 --> 01:04:51,887
Well, any ideas?

1003
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:55,515
Well, we could solidify it
in ice cube trays.

1004
01:04:55,683 --> 01:04:58,977
Well, I've got an idea.

1005
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:20,373
Hey, is this gonna work?

1006
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:24,169
- Is, like, "Schwarzenegger" hard to spell?
- Come on.

1007
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:26,171
Yeah.

1008
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:38,808
- Pretty quiet.
- Yeah.

1009
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:41,853
Shredder!

1010
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:45,857
Thanks, Raph.
I may never have the hiccups again.

1011
01:05:52,823 --> 01:05:54,324
Got it.

1012
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:56,493
Welcome.

1013
01:05:56,661 --> 01:05:59,996
Whoa, all we need now
is wide world ofSports and a blimp.

1014
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:02,332
- Yeah.
- How ironic.

1015
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:06,711
The very thing that was your making
will now be your undoing.

1016
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:10,799
Tokka. Rahzar.

1017
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:13,718
Let the games begin.

1018
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:17,555
What?

1019
01:06:23,187 --> 01:06:24,729
- Aah.
- Whoa.

1020
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:34,280
What? Oh.

1021
01:06:34,448 --> 01:06:36,241
Leo, come on, come on.

1022
01:06:38,202 --> 01:06:39,995
- Go, go, go.
- Hey.

1023
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:44,708
Wait!

1024
01:06:45,626 --> 01:06:48,294
First, we should observe
the ancient ritual...

1025
01:06:48,462 --> 01:06:53,341
...of the, uh,
traditional prefight doughnut.

1026
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:55,510
- Yeah.
- Prefight doughnut?

1027
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:57,595
- What is that?
- What?

1028
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:02,267
Ooh.

1029
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:06,563
- Why did I let you talk me into this?
- Give it a chance.

1030
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:10,275
- Come on.
- Hi, guys.

1031
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:13,570
- It's not gonna work.
- Yes, it is. They'll eat anything.

1032
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:18,616
Mmm. Num-nums.

1033
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:22,078
- Oh, yes. Mmm, num-nums.
- Yeah.

1034
01:07:24,415 --> 01:07:26,374
Mmm. Nummers.

1035
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:29,461
Yeah. Good boy. A little drooly.

1036
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:31,629
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

1037
01:07:31,797 --> 01:07:32,881
- Good boy.
- Yeah, yeah.

1038
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:37,969
No, no.

1039
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:40,805
- Oh, yeah, right. Right.
- Go on.

1040
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:43,975
Here you go.

1041
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:46,603
Yeah, in your mouth.

1042
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:48,480
Wolf it down. Scarf it.

1043
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:50,231
- Have another. Yeah.
- Eat it.

1044
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:52,567
- Eat it. It'll be great. Eat it.
- Yeah.

1045
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:56,529
What...?

1046
01:07:58,532 --> 01:07:59,574
Hey.

1047
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:00,992
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.

1048
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,911
- No, they found the cubes.
- Man.

1049
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,621
I told you it wasrt gonna work.

1050
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:06,247
Get them.

1051
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:09,459
It was him. I never touched it.

1052
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:13,922
No, wait. Can't we talk this out?

1053
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:16,341
No, wait. Wait. Whoa.

1054
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:21,679
Major spin cycle.

1055
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:30,605
Mikey?

1056
01:08:33,859 --> 01:08:37,695
Maybe I should've brought bagels.

1057
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:44,702
Now I know
what a postal package feels like.

1058
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:46,704
- Hey, Mikey, you okay?
- Yeah.

1059
01:08:46,872 --> 01:08:49,124
- You take the ugly one.
- You take the ugly one.

1060
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:52,710
- I'll take the ugly one.
- Which one's the ugly one?

1061
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:55,713
Clear the way!

1062
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:05,390
Huh?

1063
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:08,643
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

1064
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:12,397
- Get back. Go on. Go on.
- Hey, come here.

1065
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,572
Hey, you want some more?
Here, come on. Come on.

1066
01:09:20,739 --> 01:09:23,324
Just look at those costumes.

1067
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:25,076
I love this place.

1068
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:28,997
Hey, you, table for one.

1069
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:30,665
Oh, yeah.

1070
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:43,052
Man, could this get any worse?

1071
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:47,515
- Oh, foul.
- Ew.

1072
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:49,434
Nasty.

1073
01:09:50,227 --> 01:09:53,021
Hey, nice tie, bro. You mind?

1074
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:05,450
Okay, big brown ugly dude, I'm over here.

1075
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:06,868
Come on, try to get me. Come on.

1076
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:21,299
So slow.

1077
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:32,227
- Professor.
- It would appear the antimutagen...

1078
01:10:32,394 --> 01:10:34,062
...has been somewhat ineffective.

1079
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:37,732
No kidding. We've gotta do something.
Come on.

1080
01:10:47,284 --> 01:10:49,619
What is this? I didn't order any extras.

1081
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:51,454
- Did you order any extras?
- Well...

1082
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:53,706
- Where did these extras come from?
- Well...

1083
01:10:53,874 --> 01:10:57,710
Get me a phone. I want the police. Now.
Phone. Police. Go.

1084
01:10:57,878 --> 01:10:59,170
Go! Hurry up!

1085
01:11:00,506 --> 01:11:03,049
- Nice swing.
- Oh, this is bad.

1086
01:11:03,217 --> 01:11:07,345
Carbon dioxide is essential
to the antimutanagenic process.

1087
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:11,182
Their burping
is probably retarding the reaction.

1088
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:13,309
Isn't there any way to speed it back up?

1089
01:11:13,477 --> 01:11:17,689
Well, the reintroduction of CO2
could act as a catalyst.

1090
01:11:17,856 --> 01:11:22,026
- The problem is finding a ready supply.
- Yeah.

1091
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:30,118
Genius. Pure genius.

1092
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:45,633
I can't take this anymore.

1093
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:48,386
We should be out there with the guys.

1094
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:51,055
No. You have youth.

1095
01:11:51,223 --> 01:11:52,807
I have experience.

1096
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:57,061
- But only those who now fight have both.
- But I can fight.

1097
01:11:57,229 --> 01:11:59,397
They fight because they must...

1098
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:03,234
...but it is the last choice
for the true ninja.

1099
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:08,156
Used unwisely,
it becomes a double-edged sword.

1100
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:13,494
Look, I know you're trying to help me,
but you can't keep me here, you know.

1101
01:12:13,662 --> 01:12:15,163
No.

1102
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:18,082
I cannot.

1103
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:30,094
- You sure about this, Donny?
- Don't worry. Just do it.

1104
01:12:30,262 --> 01:12:31,929
Right. Right.

1105
01:12:32,097 --> 01:12:34,724
Come on, guys. Come on.

1106
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:36,768
Come on, come on, come on.

1107
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:40,772
Come on. Over here, big guy.

1108
01:12:41,648 --> 01:12:42,940
- Hey, Mikey?
- Yeah.

1109
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:44,609
Raph, now.

1110
01:12:44,777 --> 01:12:46,402
Rock 'r roll!

1111
01:12:49,990 --> 01:12:51,699
- Do it, Donny.
- Open wide.

1112
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:52,909
Say it.

1113
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:59,415
I think it's working.

1114
01:13:04,254 --> 01:13:07,382
Hey, these dudes
are copping major Z's already.

1115
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:09,842
- Yeah. All right.
- Yeah.

1116
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:11,052
All right.

1117
01:13:12,846 --> 01:13:14,097
- Hey.
- What? What? What?

1118
01:13:14,264 --> 01:13:15,723
- The police.
- The police?

1119
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:19,977
What are you doing?
They like it. They like it.

1120
01:13:20,145 --> 01:13:24,107
- Go, go, go.
- It's okay, they like it.

1121
01:13:24,775 --> 01:13:26,192
The Foot.

1122
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:28,403
It's party time, boys.

1123
01:13:31,156 --> 01:13:33,241
I win, you lose.

1124
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,251
One, two, three, four.

1125
01:13:58,350 --> 01:13:59,684
Wishbone crunch on two.

1126
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:02,520
Hut, hut. Wow!

1127
01:14:13,907 --> 01:14:15,783
Yeah.

1128
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:29,839
Break it down.

1129
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:35,845
Yeah.

1130
01:14:36,013 --> 01:14:38,055
Are you ready?

1131
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:41,642
My man.

1132
01:14:42,394 --> 01:14:44,479
Oh, yeah.

1133
01:14:44,938 --> 01:14:46,063
Oh, wait.

1134
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:49,734
All right.

1135
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:52,570
Come on.

1136
01:14:53,071 --> 01:14:54,155
Now we're shaking.

1137
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:55,531
Oh, yeah.

1138
01:14:55,866 --> 01:15:00,369
You like what you saw?
Then give it up for a turtle!

1139
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:03,873
Yeah!

1140
01:15:04,041 --> 01:15:07,084
- Ninja. Ninja. Ninja.
- Come on.

1141
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:13,591
Oh, man.

1142
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:17,261
We're not through yet.

1143
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:20,765
Just save yourself the trouble, Shredder.
It's all over.

1144
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:22,975
- Yeah.
- The battle is yours...

1145
01:15:23,143 --> 01:15:25,269
...but the war is far from over.

1146
01:15:25,437 --> 01:15:28,231
Not so long as I possess this.

1147
01:15:28,482 --> 01:15:30,024
- The green stuff.
- Oh, no.

1148
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:31,484
Hand it over, Shredder.

1149
01:15:31,652 --> 01:15:32,777
- Yeah.
- Of course.

1150
01:15:33,278 --> 01:15:37,281
In small doses through future mutants.

1151
01:15:37,449 --> 01:15:39,408
You'll have to get through us first, pal.

1152
01:15:39,576 --> 01:15:40,618
Yeah.

1153
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:42,745
A pleasure.

1154
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:45,456
- Hey, guys, I'm here.
- What?

1155
01:15:45,624 --> 01:15:47,375
Get out of my way. Get out. Watch out.

1156
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,293
Keno, don't do it.
Keno, don't do it.

1157
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:51,295
Don't...

1158
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:54,966
- Get it.
- Let me go.

1159
01:15:55,133 --> 01:15:57,802
- Stay back.
- Keno, stay back.

1160
01:15:57,970 --> 01:15:59,762
- Get off my back.
- You are a fool.

1161
01:16:01,682 --> 01:16:03,266
- What are you doing?
- Back.

1162
01:16:03,433 --> 01:16:05,309
You're not going anywhere, Shredder.

1163
01:16:05,477 --> 01:16:07,979
On the contrary. We're going somewhere.

1164
01:16:08,146 --> 01:16:10,314
- Hey, Donny, come on.
- If you try to stop us...

1165
01:16:10,482 --> 01:16:12,608
...l'll cover her with this.

1166
01:16:13,277 --> 01:16:16,153
- Let me go. I can take him. Come on.
- Full volume.

1167
01:16:16,321 --> 01:16:19,490
- Keno, it's not your fight.
- Did you...?

1168
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:21,325
- Hit it, Mikey.
- Rock 'r roll.

1169
01:16:21,493 --> 01:16:23,202
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1170
01:16:30,919 --> 01:16:32,503
Yeah.

1171
01:16:32,671 --> 01:16:33,671
Is she all right?

1172
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:37,341
- Keno, I told you this is not...
- I know, I know. This is not my fight.

1173
01:16:37,509 --> 01:16:38,843
At last.

1174
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:40,553
- Come on, let's go.
- I'm coming.

1175
01:16:40,721 --> 01:16:42,638
I learned that from a rat.

1176
01:16:42,806 --> 01:16:44,181
Later, Keno, dude.

1177
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:47,852
- Aw.
- Huh?

1178
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:51,856
Tokka and Rahzar. How cute.

1179
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:55,359
Hey, we could make a fortune
in the diet racket.

1180
01:16:55,527 --> 01:16:57,653
- Oh, Mikey.
- Go.

1181
01:16:58,530 --> 01:17:01,324
Maybe you set
some kind of a distance record.

1182
01:17:01,491 --> 01:17:04,368
- Doubtful.
- Hey, where'd he go?

1183
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:10,875
- Anything?
- Nothing.

1184
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:14,420
Well, dudes,
I'd say that's pretty much a wrap.

1185
01:17:14,588 --> 01:17:15,630
Yup.

1186
01:17:15,797 --> 01:17:17,715
Cowabunga?

1187
01:17:18,383 --> 01:17:20,217
- Cowabunga.
- Yeah.

1188
01:17:20,385 --> 01:17:22,887
Cowabunga.

1189
01:17:24,973 --> 01:17:26,015
What?

1190
01:17:40,822 --> 01:17:42,490
The last vial of ooze.

1191
01:17:43,533 --> 01:17:46,410
He must've drank all of it.

1192
01:17:46,745 --> 01:17:49,330
It's a super Shredder.

1193
01:18:00,217 --> 01:18:04,053
Great. Now what are we supposed to do?

1194
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:11,102
This thing can't take much more of this,
not with all that stuff on top.

1195
01:18:13,647 --> 01:18:16,899
- Shredder, you gotta listen to reason.
- Yeah.

1196
01:18:17,067 --> 01:18:18,901
You're gonna destroy us all.

1197
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:23,239
Then so be it.

1198
01:18:24,074 --> 01:18:25,741
- You okay?
- Leo.

1199
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:29,954
Hey, it's all coming down!

1200
01:18:30,455 --> 01:18:31,622
Watch your head, guys!

1201
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:33,416
Hey, yo.

1202
01:18:33,667 --> 01:18:35,292
We're pancakes!

1203
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:42,299
A true ninja is a master of himself
and his environment.

1204
01:18:42,467 --> 01:18:44,969
So don't forget we're turtles.

1205
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:46,637
- Oh, yeah!
- Go!

1206
01:19:34,519 --> 01:19:38,189
Man, I love being a turtle.

1207
01:19:38,356 --> 01:19:40,524
Too bad the Shredder
can't say the same thing.

1208
01:19:40,692 --> 01:19:41,734
Yeah.

1209
01:19:41,902 --> 01:19:44,528
- Look.
- What?

1210
01:19:44,988 --> 01:19:47,156
It can't be.

1211
01:19:47,324 --> 01:19:50,201
- Nobody could've survived that.
- No.

1212
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:57,666
That's the end of the Shredder.

1213
01:19:57,834 --> 01:19:59,418
Yeah.

1214
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:02,922
And in a bizarre final note...

1215
01:20:03,089 --> 01:20:05,716
...to the mysterious disappearance
of TGRI...

1216
01:20:06,343 --> 01:20:10,054
...this message was delivered

1217
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:16,101
"To Leonardo, Michaelangelo,
Raphael and Donatello..."

1218
01:20:16,269 --> 01:20:17,394
Idiots.

1219
01:20:17,562 --> 01:20:21,440
"...thanks for your help, dudes."

1220
01:20:21,608 --> 01:20:23,651
Signed, Professor Jordan Perry.

1221
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:25,069
Oy.

1222
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:27,404
Of course we can only guess
at its meaning.

1223
01:20:28,156 --> 01:20:29,698
And now this.

1224
01:20:29,866 --> 01:20:30,908
Yeah.

1225
01:20:31,076 --> 01:20:33,077
Yeah.
Woo-hoo!

1226
01:20:33,245 --> 01:20:35,204
- Oh, yeah.
- Bodacious.

1227
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:36,914
Ostentatious.

1228
01:20:37,082 --> 01:20:38,499
Hey, hey, spacious.

1229
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:39,875
Hey, dudes.

1230
01:20:40,043 --> 01:20:41,877
Cowabunga says it all.

1231
01:20:42,045 --> 01:20:44,421
Cowabunga.

1232
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:46,590
- Oh, yeah.
- Go, ninja, go.

1233
01:20:46,925 --> 01:20:47,965
Go.

1234
01:20:48,130 --> 01:20:50,090
We're home.

1235
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:52,760
Were you seen?

1236
01:20:52,930 --> 01:20:54,515
Of course not, Master Splinter.

1237
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:55,930
- We practice ninja.
- Yeah.

1238
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:58,530
The art of invisibility.

1239
01:21:02,607 --> 01:21:04,580
Practice harder.

1240
01:21:06,985 --> 01:21:08,655
Ten flips now.

1241
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:12,115
Go, ninja, go, ninja, go.

1242
01:21:13,610 --> 01:21:15,000
I made another funny.

1242
01:21:16,305 --> 01:22:16,715
