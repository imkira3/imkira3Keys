00:00:05,928 --> 00:00:08,730
<i>Who said that? What does
that even mean? Doesn't matter.</i>

2
00:00:08,755 --> 00:00:09,955
<i>I said it cause he said it.</i>

3
00:00:10,155 --> 00:00:13,457
<i>So now he was famous and basically
getting said by two well known guys.</i>

4
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:16,709
<i>I don't, uh...I'm gonna
start again.</i>

5
00:00:19,036 --> 00:00:21,037
<i>Let's track this from the beginning.</i>

7
00:00:57,367 --> 00:00:58,873
Half-hour 'till the
ball drops.

8
00:01:00,234 --> 00:01:02,448
Tony Stark, great
speech man!

9
00:01:02,742 --> 00:01:04,078
I gave a speech?

10
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:06,117
How was it?
- Edifying. - Unintelligible.

11
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:08,353
Really? That's my favorite
kind, a winning combo.

12
00:01:08,354 --> 00:01:09,943
- Hey, uh, where are we going?
- Uh, to town on each other,

13
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:11,997
probably back at your house.
I want to see your research.

14
00:01:12,097 --> 00:01:13,592
Okay, you can see my
research, but that's...

15
00:01:13,994 --> 00:01:15,304
I'm not going to show
you my "town".

16
00:01:15,405 --> 00:01:19,474
- Mr. Stark, Ho Yinsen.
- Oh, I finally met a man called Ho.

17
00:01:19,865 --> 00:01:23,099
I'd like to introduce you to our
guest, Doctor Wu.

18
00:01:23,111 --> 00:01:24,462
- Oh this guy.
- Mr. Stark.

19
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,882
Hey.

20
00:01:25,907 --> 00:01:28,008
She's going to need a cardiologist
right away.

21
00:01:29,216 --> 00:01:30,645
- Bye!
- Perhaps another time?

22
00:01:31,804 --> 00:01:34,910
<i>It started in Bern,
Switzerland, 1999.</i>

23
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,430
<i>The old days.</i>

24
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,032
<i>I never thought they'd come back to bite me.</i>

25
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:46,367
Hey Tony! Aldrich Killian,
I'm a big fan of your work.

26
00:01:46,567 --> 00:01:47,966
- My work?
- Who isn't? She needs me.

27
00:01:47,967 --> 00:01:51,460
Well, of course, but Miss
Hansen my organization

28
00:01:51,461 --> 00:01:54,237
has been tracking your research since
year two of MIT.

29
00:01:55,609 --> 00:01:57,450
Oh wow, he made it.
He made the cut.

30
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:00,402
- What floor you going to, pal?
- Well now, that is an appropriate question.

31
00:02:00,488 --> 00:02:03,688
The ground floor, actually, of a proposal
I'm putting together myself.

32
00:02:03,716 --> 00:02:07,316
It's a privately-funded think tank called
"Advanced Idea Mechanics".

33
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:11,398
Uh, she'll take both. One to throw
away and one to not call.

34
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,830
"Advanced Idea Mechanics" or AIM
for short, you get it?

35
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,041
I see that 'cause it's on
your T-shirt.

36
00:02:17,066 --> 00:02:17,608
Oh!!

37
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:20,547
Ladies, follow the mullet.
Ladies first.

38
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,643
Thank you. I'll call you.

39
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:27,679
I am titillated by the notion
of working with you. - Yeah?

40
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,758
I'm going to ditch
these clowns.

41
00:02:28,783 --> 00:02:29,984
I'll see you up on the roof
in five minutes.

42
00:02:30,094 --> 00:02:32,946
I'm just going to try to get my beef wet real quick
if you know what I'm talkin' about.

43
00:02:33,328 --> 00:02:34,191
I'll see you up there!

44
00:02:34,211 --> 00:02:35,143
Damn betcha.

45
00:02:35,843 --> 00:02:38,924
- Come on, I thought that was just a theory.
- Well... it was.

46
00:02:39,124 --> 00:02:41,579
If I'm right, we can access the area
of the brain

47
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,828
that governs repair and chemically recode it.
- That's incredible.

48
00:02:44,899 --> 00:02:48,671
Essentially, you're hacking into the genetic
operating system of a

49
00:02:48,672 --> 00:02:49,775
- living organism.
- Exactly.

50
00:02:50,882 --> 00:02:54,994
Can you not touch my plant?
It's not... she doesn't like it. She perfers -

51
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:56,183
She's not like the others.

52
00:02:56,184 --> 00:02:57,676
Come on, let's go to
the bedroom.

53
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,887
Happy, leave her
ficus alone.

54
00:03:00,588 --> 00:03:01,598
No, seriously, don't

55
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,269
- And you're starting with plants?
- For now, yes.

56
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,780
I'm calling it "Extremis".

57
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:09,122
- Well, its -
- Human application.

58
00:03:09,263 --> 00:03:12,174
Exactly! Exactly!
Dentra-degree vitalization.

59
00:03:12,395 --> 00:03:14,016
Disease prevention.

60
00:03:14,184 --> 00:03:15,249
Even limb regrowth.

61
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:18,699
You're the most gifted woman
I've ever met.

62
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,789
- Wow!
- In Switzerland.

63
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,951
- That's better.
- This week.

64
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,402
You almost bought it,
didn't you?

65
00:03:36,928 --> 00:03:39,280
This is what I'm talking
about, the glitch.

66
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:40,790
Have you checked the telomerase
algorithm?

67
00:03:43,863 --> 00:03:45,434
- We're good.
- Stay down.

68
00:03:45,435 --> 00:03:47,634
You're right on me...

69
00:03:48,525 --> 00:03:49,756
What the hell was that?

70
00:03:51,558 --> 00:03:52,552
What the hell was that?

71
00:03:52,553 --> 00:03:53,236
It's a glitch in my work.

72
00:03:53,637 --> 00:03:55,629
She was just talking about it.
Glitches happen.

73
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,170
Oh, it's not Y2K...

74
00:03:57,261 --> 00:03:58,726
Hey, Happy New
Year!

75
00:03:58,727 --> 00:03:59,581
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

76
00:03:59,582 --> 00:04:01,723
Alright, I'll see you in the morning,
Okay? Good night.

77
00:04:01,724 --> 00:04:02,075
You good?

78
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:03,584
- Yep. - I'll be right outside.
- Okay, cool.

79
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:29,450
<i>So, why am I telling you this? Because I
had just created demons.</i>

80
00:04:30,568 --> 00:04:32,000
<i>And I didn't even know it.</i>

81
00:04:34,553 --> 00:04:36,753
<i>Yeah, those were good times.</i>

82
00:04:37,664 --> 00:04:38,905
<i>Then I moved on.</i>

83
00:04:39,716 --> 00:04:43,787
<i>After a brief soiree in an Afghan cave,
I said "Goodbye" to the party scene.</i>

84
00:04:43,887 --> 00:04:46,169
<i>I forgot that night in Switzerland.</i>

85
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,340
<i>These days I'm a changed man.</i>

86
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,202
<i>I'm different now.</i>

87
00:04:50,821 --> 00:04:53,624
<i>I'm... well, you know
who I am.</i>

88
00:04:54,343 --> 00:04:55,593
Sir, please may I request

89
00:04:55,594 --> 00:04:58,416
just a few hours to calibrate -
- Nope!

90
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:04,259
Micro-repeater implanting
sequence complete!

91
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,086
As you wish, sir. I've
also prepared a

92
00:05:06,087 --> 00:05:08,100
safety briefing for you
to enitrely ignore.

93
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:09,752
Which I will.

94
00:05:09,753 --> 00:05:11,173
Alright, let's do this.

95
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:16,146
Dummy. Hi Dummy.
How did you get that cap on your head?

96
00:05:16,147 --> 00:05:17,256
You earned it.

97
00:05:17,281 --> 00:05:18,582
Hey. Hey!

98
00:05:20,499 --> 00:05:22,030
What are you doing out of the corner?
You know what you did.

99
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,372
Blood on my mat, handle it.

100
00:05:25,232 --> 00:05:28,594
Sir, may I remind you that you've been
awake for nearly 72 hours.

101
00:05:29,645 --> 00:05:31,756
Focus up ladies.
Good evening

102
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,567
And welcome to the
birthing suite.

103
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:36,313
I am pleased to announce the
imminent arrival

104
00:05:36,414 --> 00:05:39,181
of your bouncing,
badass baby brother.

105
00:05:39,993 --> 00:05:42,435
Start titan and go white.
Stamp date and time.

106
00:05:43,455 --> 00:05:46,305
Mark 42 autonomous prehensile
propulsion suit test.

107
00:05:46,842 --> 00:05:47,909
Initialize sequence.

108
00:05:50,387 --> 00:05:52,207
Jarvis, drop my needle.

109
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,282
Crap.

110
00:06:35,743 --> 00:06:37,764
Alright, I think we got this.
Send them all.

111
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:50,332
Probably just a little fast, slow it down.
Slow it down just a... little bit.

112
00:06:58,056 --> 00:06:59,918
Cool it, will you Jarvis?

113
00:07:10,183 --> 00:07:11,442
Come on.

114
00:07:12,035 --> 00:07:13,336
I ain't scared of you.

115
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,110
I'm the best.

116
00:07:28,724 --> 00:07:32,306
As always sir, a great pleasure
watching you work.

117
00:07:32,337 --> 00:07:36,007
<i>I guess 72 hours is a long
time between siestas.</i>

118
00:07:36,268 --> 00:07:39,079
<i>Didn't think it could
get any worse.</i>

119
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,612
<i>Then they had to go and
turn on the TV.</i>

120
00:07:45,543 --> 00:07:47,324
<i>That's when 'He' happened.</i>

121
00:07:56,201 --> 00:07:58,461
Some people call me a terrorist.

122
00:08:01,383 --> 00:08:03,504
I consider myself a teacher.

123
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:08,027
America...

124
00:08:09,297 --> 00:08:12,539
Ready for another lesson.

125
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,391
In 1864 in Sand Creek, Colorado.

126
00:08:15,591 --> 00:08:20,443
The U.S. military waited until the friendly
Cheyenne Braves had all gone hunting.

127
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:24,696
Waited to attack and slaughter
the families left behind.

128
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:28,328
And claim their land.

129
00:08:28,329 --> 00:08:34,423
39 hours ago, the Ali Al Salem Air Base
in Kuwait was attacked.

130
00:08:35,293 --> 00:08:37,484
I did that.

131
00:08:37,485 --> 00:08:41,226
A quaint military church, filled with
wives and children of course.

132
00:08:43,707 --> 00:08:46,909
The soliders were out
on manuvers.

133
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,492
The "Braves" were away.

134
00:08:51,763 --> 00:08:57,086
President Ellis, you continue to resist
my attempts to educate you, sir.

135
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,508
And now, you've missed
me again.

136
00:09:02,598 --> 00:09:06,851
You know who I am.
You don't know where I am.

137
00:09:08,201 --> 00:09:11,134
And you'll never
see me coming.

138
00:09:14,225 --> 00:09:16,847
... and now that we seem to be back,
let's recap some of the frightening developments in this story.

139
00:09:17,067 --> 00:09:19,159
American airways
were hijacked.

140
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,680
The nation remains
on high alert.

141
00:09:20,681 --> 00:09:23,250
All attempts to find the Mandarin have
so far proved unsuccessful.

142
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:28,274
Central to my administration's response to this
terrorist event is a newly-minted resource.

143
00:09:29,155 --> 00:09:32,156
I know him as Colonel
James Rhodes.

144
00:09:32,456 --> 00:09:35,988
The American people will soon
know him as the Iron Patriot.

145
00:09:36,227 --> 00:09:39,030
And how is President
Ellis responding?

146
00:09:39,311 --> 00:09:43,483
By taking the guy they call "War Machine"
and giving him a paint job.

147
00:09:43,484 --> 00:09:47,736
The same suit but painted red,
white and blue, look at that.

148
00:09:47,737 --> 00:09:50,636
And they've also renamed
him Iron Patriot.

149
00:09:50,736 --> 00:09:54,168
You know, just in case the
paint was too subtle.

150
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,190
It tested well with focus
groups, alright?

151
00:09:56,191 --> 00:09:57,961
- I am Iron Patriot.
- Listen.

152
00:09:57,962 --> 00:09:59,949
War Machine was a little too
aggressive, alright.

153
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,092
This sends a better message.

154
00:10:03,224 --> 00:10:06,626
So what's really going on?
With Mandarin.

155
00:10:07,477 --> 00:10:10,158
Seriously, can we talk
about this guy?

156
00:10:12,819 --> 00:10:15,320
It's classified information,
Tony.

157
00:10:15,751 --> 00:10:18,503
- Okay, there've been nine bombings.
- Nine.

158
00:10:18,504 --> 00:10:20,135
The public only knows about three.

159
00:10:20,136 --> 00:10:23,275
But here's the thing...
nobody can ID a device.

160
00:10:23,546 --> 00:10:24,747
There's no bomb casings.

161
00:10:24,748 --> 00:10:25,857
You know I can help.

162
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:30,330
Just ask. I got a ton of new tech.
I got a prehensile suit. I got

163
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:30,851
Bomb disposal.

164
00:10:30,852 --> 00:10:32,292
Catches explosions mid-air.

165
00:10:32,293 --> 00:10:34,094
When's the last time you got
a good night's sleep?

166
00:10:34,095 --> 00:10:36,963
Einstein slept three hours a year.
Look what he did.

167
00:10:36,964 --> 00:10:38,109
People are concerned about
you, Tony.

168
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,155
I'm concerned about you.

169
00:10:39,345 --> 00:10:40,333
You gonna come at
me like that?

170
00:10:40,334 --> 00:10:42,197
No, look, I'm not trying
to be a dic-

171
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:45,398
-tator.
- Would you mind signing my drawing?

172
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:48,035
If Richard doesn't mind. You alright
with this, Dick?

173
00:10:48,536 --> 00:10:49,432
Fine with me.

174
00:10:51,221 --> 00:10:52,704
- What is your name?
- Erin.

175
00:10:54,305 --> 00:10:56,736
I loved you in "A Christmas Story"
by the way.

176
00:10:57,626 --> 00:10:59,697
Listen, the Pentagon
is scared.

177
00:10:59,937 --> 00:11:02,667
After New York, aliens,
come on.

178
00:11:02,668 --> 00:11:04,079
They need to look strong.

179
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,372
Stopping the Mandarin is a
priority, but it's not-

180
00:11:07,773 --> 00:11:09,182
It's not superhero business.

181
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,084
No, it's not. Quite frankly.

182
00:11:10,085 --> 00:11:11,474
It's American business.

183
00:11:11,499 --> 00:11:13,600
That's why I said.
I...got it.

184
00:11:13,736 --> 00:11:14,996
Are you okay?

185
00:11:15,956 --> 00:11:17,178
I broke the crayon.

186
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:18,808
Are you okay,
Mr. Stark?

187
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:20,948
Take it easy. Tony...

188
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,071
How did you get out
of the wormhole?

189
00:11:24,981 --> 00:11:26,803
- Tony
- What did you say?

190
00:11:28,343 --> 00:11:32,996
Sorry. Have to check on
the suit... make sure...okay.

191
00:11:36,449 --> 00:11:39,070
Check the heart, check the,
check the, is it the brain?

192
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:42,362
No sign of cardiac analomy
or unusual brain activity.

193
00:11:42,483 --> 00:11:44,384
Okay, so I was
poisoned?

194
00:11:44,673 --> 00:11:49,186
My diagnosis is that you've experienced
a severe anxiety attack.

195
00:11:52,077 --> 00:11:52,818
Me?

196
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,579
Come on man, this isn't a
good look. Open up.

197
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,730
Sorry, I gotta split.

198
00:11:59,732 --> 00:12:05,345
Badge... Badge... Badge.

199
00:12:06,145 --> 00:12:08,727
Badge, guys. I put a memo in
the toliet, come on.

200
00:12:08,977 --> 00:12:10,847
Tony has got them in his basement,
they're wearing

201
00:12:10,848 --> 00:12:12,789
party hats, this is an asset
we can put to use.

202
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,029
Uh-huh. So, you're suggesting
that I replace

203
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:17,313
the entire janitorial
staff with robots?

204
00:12:17,562 --> 00:12:20,464
What I'm saying is that the human
element of Human

205
00:12:20,465 --> 00:12:22,475
Resources is our biggest
point of vulnerability.

206
00:12:22,476 --> 00:12:24,316
We should start phasing it
out immediately.

207
00:12:24,706 --> 00:12:26,237
- What!?
- Excuse me, Bambi

208
00:12:26,528 --> 00:12:28,600
- Did you just say that?
- Security

209
00:12:28,601 --> 00:12:31,969
Happy, okay, I am thrilled that you're
now the Head of Security.

210
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,712
Okay, it is the perfect position for you.
- Thank you.

211
00:12:33,713 --> 00:12:35,282
- However,
- I do appreciate it.

212
00:12:35,283 --> 00:12:37,784
- Since you've taken the post,
- You don't have to thank me.

213
00:12:37,785 --> 00:12:40,886
We've had a rise in staff complaints
of 300 percent.

214
00:12:40,895 --> 00:12:43,547
- Thank you.
- That's not a compliment.

215
00:12:43,548 --> 00:12:45,398
"That's not a compliment"?
It is a compliment!

216
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:47,209
Clearly somebody is trying
to hide something.

217
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:48,059
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

218
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,221
Miss Potts, your four o'clock
is here.

219
00:12:50,222 --> 00:12:51,910
Did you clear this four o'clock
with me?

220
00:12:51,911 --> 00:12:53,363
Happy, we'll talk about
this later

221
00:12:53,364 --> 00:12:55,995
But right now I have to go deal with
this very annoying thing.

222
00:12:55,996 --> 00:12:57,255
How so?

223
00:12:58,216 --> 00:12:59,428
I used to work with him, and he
used to ask me

224
00:12:59,429 --> 00:13:01,238
out all the time, so it's a
little awkward.

225
00:13:01,338 --> 00:13:02,699
I don't like the
sound of that.

226
00:13:08,633 --> 00:13:11,374
- Pepper.
- Killian?

227
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,116
You look great...
you look really great.

228
00:13:14,484 --> 00:13:17,223
God, you look great.

229
00:13:17,224 --> 00:13:20,539
I... I... I can't...What on Earth have
you been doing?

230
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:23,911
Nothing fancy, just five years in the
hands of physical therapists

231
00:13:23,912 --> 00:13:26,132
And please, call me Aldrich.

232
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,796
Uh, you were supposed to be
issued a security badge?

233
00:13:28,797 --> 00:13:29,564
Happy, it's okay.

234
00:13:29,565 --> 00:13:30,965
- Yes?
- We're good.

235
00:13:30,966 --> 00:13:32,286
- You sure?
- Yes.

236
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,067
- Stand down.
- I'm going to linger.

237
00:13:34,068 --> 00:13:35,498
- Thank you.
- Right here, okay.

238
00:13:35,499 --> 00:13:37,328
It's very nice to see
you, Killian.

239
00:13:44,603 --> 00:13:46,314
Hey, guy

240
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:54,839
Merry Christmas.

241
00:13:55,424 --> 00:13:59,807
After years dodging the president's ban
on "Immoral Biotech Research",

242
00:14:00,107 --> 00:14:05,667
My think tank now has a little
something in the pipeline.

243
00:14:06,569 --> 00:14:10,864
It's an idea we like to call
"Extremis".

244
00:14:11,821 --> 00:14:13,437
I'm gonna turn your
lights down.

245
00:14:15,877 --> 00:14:17,930
Regard the human brain.

246
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,661
Uh, wait, hold on, hold on, that's, that's
the universe, my bad.

247
00:14:27,662 --> 00:14:29,342
But if I do that...

248
00:14:34,387 --> 00:14:38,367
That's the brain, strangely memetic
though, wouldn't you say?

249
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:40,686
- Wow, that's amazing!
- Thanks, it's mine.

250
00:14:41,775 --> 00:14:44,898
- What?
- This... you're inside my head.

251
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:48,546
It's a live feed. Come on up,
I'll prove it to you.

252
00:14:50,748 --> 00:14:52,257
Come on.

253
00:14:54,843 --> 00:14:58,440
Now, pinch my arm. I can take it.
Pinch me.

254
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:01,576
What is that?

255
00:15:01,577 --> 00:15:03,654
The primary somatosensory
cortex.

256
00:15:03,754 --> 00:15:08,799
It's the brain's pain center, but this...
is what I wanted to show you.

257
00:15:11,194 --> 00:15:14,840
Now, "Extremis" harnesses our
bioelectrical potential.

258
00:15:15,437 --> 00:15:17,519
And it goes... here.

259
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:21,700
This is essentially an empty slot,
and what this tells us is that

260
00:15:21,701 --> 00:15:26,492
our mind, our entire DNA in fact,
is destined to be upgraded.

261
00:15:26,918 --> 00:15:27,918
Wow.

262
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:39,773
Hello? Is this forehead
of Security?

263
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:41,699
What? You know, look, I got a real job.
What do you want?

264
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,156
I'm working. I got something
going on here.

265
00:15:43,157 --> 00:15:44,753
- What? Harassing interns?
- Let me tell you something,

266
00:15:44,754 --> 00:15:46,724
You know what happened when I told people
I was Iron Man's bodyguard?

267
00:15:46,725 --> 00:15:48,347
They would laugh
in my face.

268
00:15:48,905 --> 00:15:50,806
I had to leave while I still
had a shred of dignity.

269
00:15:51,119 --> 00:15:53,530
Now I got a real job. I'm
watching Pepper.

270
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,745
What's going on?
Fill me in.

271
00:15:55,311 --> 00:15:56,236
- For real?
- Yeah.

272
00:15:56,536 --> 00:15:59,655
Alright, so she's meeting up with this
scientist rich guy, handsome.

273
00:15:59,656 --> 00:16:01,192
I couldn't make his face
at first, right?

274
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:02,130
And you know I'm good
with faces.

275
00:16:02,131 --> 00:16:04,448
- Oh yeah, you're the best.
- Yeah, so I run his credentials

276
00:16:04,449 --> 00:16:07,364
I make him Aldrich Killian. We actually
met the guy back in -

277
00:16:07,408 --> 00:16:09,966
Where were we in '99? The
Science Conference?

278
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,148
Uh,  Switzerland.

279
00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:12,703
Right, right, exactly.

280
00:16:12,704 --> 00:16:14,907
- Killian, I don't remember that guy.
- Of course you don't remember,

281
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:15,959
he's not a blonde with a big rack.

282
00:16:15,991 --> 00:16:18,256
At first it was fine, they were
talking business, but now

283
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:20,865
it's like getting weird. He's showing
her his big brain.

284
00:16:20,965 --> 00:16:23,823
- His what?
- Big brain, and she likes it.

285
00:16:23,824 --> 00:16:26,045
Here, let me show you.
Hold on. See?

286
00:16:26,345 --> 00:16:30,018
Look at what? You watching them? Flip the
screen and then we can get started.

287
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:33,091
I'm not a tech genius like you, just
trust me, get down here.

288
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:34,641
Flip the screen, then I can see
what they're doing.

289
00:16:34,642 --> 00:16:36,006
I don't know how to flip
the screen!

290
00:16:36,007 --> 00:16:38,354
Don't talk to me like that anymore.
You're not my boss.

291
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:42,507
Alright, I don't work for you, and
I don't trust this guy.

292
00:16:42,508 --> 00:16:44,308
He's got another guy with
him, he's shifty.

293
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:46,509
Relax. I'm just asking you to
secure the perimeter.

294
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,196
Tell him to go out for a
drink or something.

295
00:16:48,197 --> 00:16:50,297
You know what? You should take more
of an interest in what's going on here.

296
00:16:50,298 --> 00:16:52,193
This woman is the best thing
that ever happened to you.

297
00:16:52,194 --> 00:16:54,116
- And you're just ignoring her.
- A giant brain?

298
00:16:54,117 --> 00:16:56,243
Yeah, there's a giant brain,
there's a shifty character...

299
00:16:56,244 --> 00:16:57,728
I'm going to follow this guy.
I'm going to run

300
00:16:57,729 --> 00:17:00,336
his plates and if it
gets rough, so be it.

301
00:17:01,137 --> 00:17:02,071
I miss you, Happy.

302
00:17:02,072 --> 00:17:04,453
Yeah, I miss you too but the
way it used to be.

303
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:05,691
Now you're off with
the 'superfriends'

304
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,246
I don't know what's going on
with you anymore.

305
00:17:07,247 --> 00:17:08,139
The world's gettin' weird.

306
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,453
Hey I hate to cut you off, do you have
your taser on you?- Why?

307
00:17:10,454 --> 00:17:11,660
I think there's a gal in HR
who is trying

308
00:17:11,661 --> 00:17:15,116
to steal some printer ink. You should probably
go over there and zap her.

309
00:17:15,141 --> 00:17:16,199
Yeah, nice.

310
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,486
Imagine if you could hack into
the hard drive of

311
00:17:19,487 --> 00:17:22,559
any living organism and
recode its DNA.

312
00:17:23,287 --> 00:17:24,611
It would be incredible.

313
00:17:25,281 --> 00:17:29,059
Unfortunately, to my ears it also
sounds highly weaponizable.

314
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,978
As in enhanced soldiers, private
armies, and Tony is not -

315
00:17:32,979 --> 00:17:34,191
Tony, Tony.

316
00:17:34,992 --> 00:17:37,446
You know, I invited Tony
to join AIM.

317
00:17:38,046 --> 00:17:41,934
13 years ago and he
turned me down.

318
00:17:41,986 --> 00:17:46,969
But something tells me now there is a new genius
on the throne, who doesn't have to

319
00:17:46,971 --> 00:17:51,429
answer to Tony anymore and who
has slightly less of an ego.

320
00:17:52,868 --> 00:17:58,141
It's going to be a no, Aldrich...
as much as I'd like to help you.

321
00:18:00,195 --> 00:18:05,460
I can't say that I'm not disappointed,
but as my father used to say,

322
00:18:05,461 --> 00:18:07,773
"Failure is the fog through which
we glimpse triumph."

323
00:18:07,774 --> 00:18:11,653
It's very deep, and I have no
idea what it means.

324
00:18:11,654 --> 00:18:13,849
Well, he was kind of an
idiot, my old man.

325
00:18:15,071 --> 00:18:17,133
I'm sure I'll see you again,
Pepper.

326
00:18:28,063 --> 00:18:29,016
Happy!

327
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:32,725
The car is ready... if you're
ready to go.

328
00:18:34,373 --> 00:18:41,266
Yes, I just um, God, I forgot my other
thing so I'm just gonna...

329
00:19:09,054 --> 00:19:12,605
I'm sorry I'm late. I was..
What is that?!

330
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,857
You're wearing this in the house now?
What is that, like Mark 15?

331
00:19:16,858 --> 00:19:20,617
Yeah, something like that. You know
everybody needs a hobby.

332
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:23,468
Oh, and you have to wear your hobby
in the living room?

333
00:19:23,569 --> 00:19:27,950
Just breaking it in, you know, it's always a little
pinchy in the GUI-bagger at first.

334
00:19:27,961 --> 00:19:30,382
Oh hey, did you see your
Christmas present?

335
00:19:30,383 --> 00:19:34,687
Yes, I did. I don't know how I could have
missed that Christmas present.

336
00:19:34,688 --> 00:19:36,304
Is it gonna fit through
the door?

337
00:19:36,305 --> 00:19:38,519
Well actually, uh, that's a good question,
I got a team of

338
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,619
guys coming tomorrow. They're gonna
blow out that wall.

339
00:19:40,626 --> 00:19:43,215
So, uh, tense?
Good day?

340
00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:45,858
Oh shoulders, a little naughty.
Naughty girl.

341
00:19:46,172 --> 00:19:49,783
I don't want to harp on this, but did you
like the custom rabbit?

342
00:19:50,729 --> 00:19:51,875
Did I like it?

343
00:19:51,876 --> 00:19:53,467
- Nailed it, right?
- Wow.

344
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:56,546
I appreciate the thought
very much.

345
00:19:57,047 --> 00:20:01,380
So why don't you lift up that facemask
and give me a kiss.

346
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:05,585
Huh, yup, damnit.
No can do.

347
00:20:06,086 --> 00:20:10,090
You want to just kiss it on
the, uh, facial slit?

348
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,483
Why don't I run down to the
garage and see if

349
00:20:12,484 --> 00:20:14,528
I can't find a crowbar to jimmy
that thing open?

350
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:18,702
A crowbar? Yeah. Oh, except there's
been a radiation leak.

351
00:20:18,703 --> 00:20:20,577
- I'll take my chances.
- That's risky.

352
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:23,615
At least let me get you
like a Hazmat suit.

353
00:20:25,114 --> 00:20:26,683
Or a Geiger counter or
something like that.

354
00:20:28,787 --> 00:20:32,514
- Busted.
- This is a new level of lame.

355
00:20:32,515 --> 00:20:35,781
- Sorry.
- You ate without me, already? On date night?

356
00:20:36,265 --> 00:20:37,838
- He was just.
- You mean you.

357
00:20:38,134 --> 00:20:40,098
Well yeah, I just mean
we were just...

358
00:20:40,099 --> 00:20:42,964
just hosting you while I
finished up a little work.

359
00:20:42,989 --> 00:20:43,300
Uh Huh..

360
00:20:43,301 --> 00:20:45,880
And yes, I had a quick bite. I didn't know
if you were coming home

361
00:20:45,927 --> 00:20:48,001
Or you were having drinks with
Aldrich Killian.

362
00:20:51,037 --> 00:20:51,896
What?

363
00:20:53,197 --> 00:20:55,837
Aldrich Killian? What are you
checking up on me?

364
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,734
- Happy was concerned.
- No, you're spying on me.

365
00:20:57,735 --> 00:21:01,465
- I'm going to bed.
- Hold on. Come on. Pep-

366
00:21:01,665 --> 00:21:05,177
Hey, I admit it! My fault.
Sorry.

367
00:21:05,685 --> 00:21:07,641
I'm a piping hot mess.

368
00:21:10,043 --> 00:21:12,685
It's been going on for a while...
I haven't said anything.

369
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:18,058
- Nothing's been the same since New York.
- Oh really?

370
00:21:18,966 --> 00:21:20,990
I didn't notice
that, at all.

371
00:21:21,104 --> 00:21:26,006
You experience things and then they're over
and you still can't explain them.

372
00:21:26,467 --> 00:21:30,069
Gods, aliens, other dimensions...
I'm just a man in a can.

373
00:21:31,163 --> 00:21:34,916
The only reason I haven't cracked up is
probably because you've moved in.

374
00:21:34,917 --> 00:21:37,422
Which is great. I love
you, I'm lucky.

375
00:21:37,828 --> 00:21:41,341
But honey... I can't sleep.

376
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:46,243
You go to bed, I come down here.
I do what I know, I tinker.

377
00:21:47,746 --> 00:21:49,861
The threat is imminent.

378
00:21:49,862 --> 00:21:52,504
And I have to protect the one thing
that I can't live without.

379
00:21:53,704 --> 00:21:57,173
That's you. And my suits,
they're uh...

380
00:21:57,445 --> 00:21:59,651
- Machines.
- They're part of me.

381
00:22:01,293 --> 00:22:04,811
- A distraction.
- Maybe.

382
00:22:22,182 --> 00:22:25,510
- I'm gonna take a shower.
- Okay.

383
00:22:28,768 --> 00:22:32,606
- And you're going to join me.
- Better.

384
00:22:51,282 --> 00:22:52,574
Tony!

385
00:23:01,187 --> 00:23:02,805
Power down!

386
00:23:10,225 --> 00:23:14,283
I must have called it in my sleep.
That's not supposed to happen.

387
00:23:17,335 --> 00:23:19,668
I'll recalibrate the sensors.

388
00:23:21,172 --> 00:23:27,498
Can we just...just let me...just let me catch my
breath, okay? Don't go, alright? Pepper?

389
00:23:27,499 --> 00:23:30,509
I'm going to sleep downstairs.
Tinker with that.

390
00:23:57,357 --> 00:23:59,965
- Can you regulate?
- Yes, I can regulate.

391
00:23:59,966 --> 00:24:01,906
- Are you sure about that?
- Yes.

392
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:13,309
It's a decent batch.

393
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:16,623
Don't say I never did
nothing for you.

394
00:24:16,624 --> 00:24:20,601
Thank you. I mean for
understanding.

395
00:24:30,048 --> 00:24:31,436
I'm sorry, buddy.

396
00:24:46,928 --> 00:24:48,101
What're ya doing, buddy?

397
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:51,020
You out by yourself? A little date night? Watching
your favorite chick flick maybe?

398
00:24:51,585 --> 00:24:53,490
Yeah, a little movie called
"The Party's Over"

399
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:56,608
Starring you and your junkie girlfriend,
and here's the ticket.

400
00:24:56,609 --> 00:24:58,892
No kidding. That doesn't
belong to you.

401
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:30,090
Savin! Help!
Help me!

402
00:26:55,612 --> 00:26:58,070
A true story about fortune cookies.

403
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:01,734
They look Chinese. They
sound Chinese.

404
00:27:02,904 --> 00:27:06,449
But they're actually an
American invention.

405
00:27:06,775 --> 00:27:14,011
Which is why they're hollow, full of lies,
and leave a bad taste in the mouth.

406
00:27:15,157 --> 00:27:20,129
My disciples just destroyed another
cheap American knock-off.

407
00:27:20,329 --> 00:27:25,252
The Chinese Theater.
Mr. President.

408
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:28,818
I know this must be
getting frustrating.

409
00:27:29,218 --> 00:27:32,813
But this season of terror is
drawing to a close.

410
00:27:33,578 --> 00:27:39,932
And don't worry, the big one is
coming, your graduation.

411
00:27:54,274 --> 00:27:55,922
- Hi.
- Oh, uh.

412
00:27:56,047 --> 00:27:58,048
- Mind leaving that on?
- Sure.

413
00:28:04,828 --> 00:28:08,060
Sunday night's PBS,
"Downtown Abbey"

414
00:28:10,303 --> 00:28:11,737
That's the show. He thinks
it's elegant.

415
00:28:15,792 --> 00:28:18,315
One more thing, make sure everyone wears
their badges. He's a stickler

416
00:28:18,316 --> 00:28:20,770
for that sort of thing, plus my guys won't
let anyone in without them.

417
00:28:21,979 --> 00:28:24,122
We're awaiting the arrival
of Tony Stark.

418
00:28:24,123 --> 00:28:26,213
We're hoping he'll give
us the reaction.

419
00:28:26,214 --> 00:28:28,236
His reaction to the
latest attack.

420
00:28:28,237 --> 00:28:29,856
Mr. Stark!

421
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:33,894
Our sources are telling us that this is
another Mandarin attack.

422
00:28:33,895 --> 00:28:35,694
Anything else you can tell us?

423
00:28:36,057 --> 00:28:41,061
Hey Mr. Stark! When is somebody going
to kill this guy? Just sayin'.

424
00:28:43,703 --> 00:28:45,431
Is that what you want?

425
00:28:47,952 --> 00:28:51,650
Here's a little Holiday greeting I've been
wanting to send to the Mandarin.

426
00:28:52,023 --> 00:28:54,591
I just didn't know how to
phrase it until now.

427
00:28:55,398 --> 00:28:57,962
My name is Tony Stark and
I'm not afraid of you.

428
00:28:58,301 --> 00:29:01,368
I know that you're a coward,
so I've decided

429
00:29:02,259 --> 00:29:04,280
That you just died, pal.

430
00:29:04,281 --> 00:29:06,106
I'm gonna come get the body.

431
00:29:06,107 --> 00:29:09,221
There's no politics here, it's just good
old-fashioned revenge.

432
00:29:09,454 --> 00:29:11,724
There's no Pentagon. It's just
you and me.

433
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:15,772
And on the off-chance you're a man,
here's my home address:

434
00:29:15,773 --> 00:29:21,216
10880, Malibu Port, 90265.

435
00:29:21,739 --> 00:29:25,376
I'll leave the door unlocked. That's what
you wanted, right?

436
00:29:28,134 --> 00:29:29,600
Bill me.

437
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,491
I've compiled a Mandarin
database for you, sir.

438
00:29:37,588 --> 00:29:41,161
Drawn from S.H.I.E.L.D., F.B.I.
and C.I.A. intercepts.

439
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:44,489
Initiating virtual crimescene
reconstruction.

440
00:29:46,635 --> 00:29:49,260
Okay, what do we got here?

441
00:29:49,698 --> 00:29:52,310
His name is an ancient
Chinese war mantle

442
00:29:52,572 --> 00:29:53,890
Meaning "Advisor to the King".

443
00:29:54,698 --> 00:29:56,704
South American insurgency tactics.

444
00:29:57,405 --> 00:29:59,098
Talks like a Bapist
preacher.

445
00:29:59,975 --> 00:30:03,319
There's lots of pagentry going
on here, lots of theatre.

446
00:30:04,251 --> 00:30:08,348
Close. - The heat from the blast was
in excess of 3000 degrees Celsius.

447
00:30:08,714 --> 00:30:12,064
Any subjects within 12.5 yards
were vaporized instantly.

448
00:30:12,486 --> 00:30:15,946
No bomb parts found in a 3-mile radius
of the Chinese theatre. - No, sir.

449
00:30:18,302 --> 00:30:19,796
Talk to me, Happy.

450
00:30:38,392 --> 00:30:40,798
When is a bomb not a bomb?

451
00:30:51,356 --> 00:30:54,815
- Any military victims?
- Not according to public records, sir.

452
00:30:55,315 --> 00:30:58,887
Bring up the thermogenic signatures
again, factor in 3000 degrees.

453
00:30:58,888 --> 00:31:01,498
The oracle cloud has
completed analysis.

454
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:06,664
Accessing satellites and plotting the last 12
months of thermogenic occurances now.

455
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:10,509
Take away everywhere that there's
been a Mandarin attack.

456
00:31:15,158 --> 00:31:16,326
Nope.

457
00:31:23,188 --> 00:31:25,012
That. You sure that's
not one of his?

458
00:31:25,013 --> 00:31:27,426
It predates any known
Mandarin attack.

459
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:30,469
The incident was the use of a
bomb to assist a suicide.

460
00:31:30,494 --> 00:31:31,495
Bring it around.

461
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:37,516
The heat signature is remarkably similar.
3000 degrees Celsius.

462
00:31:39,027 --> 00:31:40,939
That's two military guys.

463
00:31:42,132 --> 00:31:43,601
Ever been to Tennessee, Jarvis?

464
00:31:43,602 --> 00:31:45,717
Creating a flight plan for Tennessee.

465
00:31:51,556 --> 00:31:56,845
Are we still at 'Ding-Dong'? We're supposed
to be on total security lockdown.

466
00:31:56,846 --> 00:31:59,456
Come on, I threatened a terrorist.
Who is that?

467
00:31:59,457 --> 00:32:04,508
There's only so much I can do, sir, when you give
the world's press your home address.

468
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:16,322
Right there's fine.

469
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:24,593
You're not the Mandarin, are you?
Are you?

470
00:32:25,695 --> 00:32:29,555
You don't remember. Why I
am not surprised?

471
00:32:29,556 --> 00:32:31,220
Don't take it personally, I don't remember
what I had for breakfast.

472
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:33,712
- Gluten-free waffles, sir.
- That's right.

473
00:32:33,727 --> 00:32:38,524
Look, I need to be alone with you, someplace
not here... it's urgent.

474
00:32:40,433 --> 00:32:44,019
Normally, I'd go for that sort of thing, but now
I'm in a committed relationship

475
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:48,128
- It's... with her.
- Tony

476
00:32:49,111 --> 00:32:52,150
- Is somebody there?
- Yeah, it's Maya Hansen.

477
00:32:53,245 --> 00:32:57,457
Old botanist pal that I used
to know, barely.

478
00:32:57,527 --> 00:33:00,929
Please don't tell me that there is a 12-year-old
kid waiting in the car that I've never met.

479
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:05,164
- He's 13. No, I need your help.
- What for? Why now?

480
00:33:05,165 --> 00:33:08,611
Because I read the papers, and, frankly,
I don't think you'll last the week.

481
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:10,140
- I'll be fine.
- I'm sorry.

482
00:33:10,198 --> 00:33:13,419
With Happy in the hospital, I didn't
know we were expecting guests.

483
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,267
We weren't.

484
00:33:14,357 --> 00:33:16,122
- And old girlfriends!
- She's not really.

485
00:33:16,123 --> 00:33:18,952
No, not really. It was
just one night.

486
00:33:18,958 --> 00:33:22,356
- Yep.
- That's how you did it, isn't it?

487
00:33:22,357 --> 00:33:23,344
It was a great night

488
00:33:23,345 --> 00:33:24,602
- Well... you know
- Yeah.

489
00:33:24,603 --> 00:33:26,480
You have saved yourself
a world of pain.

490
00:33:26,481 --> 00:33:27,354
- What?
- Trust me.

491
00:33:27,355 --> 00:33:28,490
We're going out of town.

492
00:33:28,491 --> 00:33:30,357
- Okay, we've been through this. Nope.
- Yep!

493
00:33:30,358 --> 00:33:32,758
- The man says no.
- Immediately and indefinitely.

494
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:34,353
- Great idea. Let's go.
- I'm sorry.

495
00:33:34,354 --> 00:33:36,637
That's a terrible idea. Please don't
touch her bags.

496
00:33:36,638 --> 00:33:38,543
Tony, this is how normal
people behave.

497
00:33:38,544 --> 00:33:40,675
I can't protect you out there.
I challenged-

498
00:33:40,676 --> 00:33:42,286
- Is this normal?
- Sadly, that

499
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:43,620
Yes, this is normal!

500
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:46,470
- Is very normal
- It's a big bunny, relax about it!

501
00:33:46,471 --> 00:33:48,919
- Calm down!
- I got this for you.

502
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,249
- I'm aware of that.
- You still haven't even told me that you liked it!

503
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,779
- I don't like it!
- I asked you three- You don't like it?!

504
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:57,152
We are leaving the house, that's not
even up for discussion. - Guys... do we umm...

505
00:33:57,162 --> 00:34:00,496
- What?
- Do we need to worry about that?

506
00:34:49,005 --> 00:34:51,669
- I got you.
- I got you first.

507
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:53,639
Like I said, we can't
stay here.

508
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:04,841
Move! I'm right behind.

509
00:35:09,663 --> 00:35:10,892
Get her, I'm going to
find a way around.

510
00:35:11,684 --> 00:35:15,030
Stop stopping! Get her.
Get outside! Go!

511
00:35:38,231 --> 00:35:39,921
Oh my God.
Tony!

512
00:35:53,845 --> 00:35:55,665
Sir, Miss Potts is clear
of the structure.

513
00:36:28,822 --> 00:36:30,502
Jarvis, where's my flight power?

514
00:36:30,503 --> 00:36:32,527
Working on it, sir. This is
a prototype.

515
00:36:47,553 --> 00:36:48,630
That's one.

516
00:36:50,223 --> 00:36:53,307
Sir, the suit is not combat-ready.

517
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:09,797
That's two.

518
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,335
Tony!

519
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,766
Sir, take a deep breath.

520
00:39:16,592 --> 00:39:18,155
Flight power restored.

521
00:39:32,898 --> 00:39:35,840
Sir. Sir!

522
00:39:36,629 --> 00:39:38,930
Alright, kill the
alarm. I got it.

523
00:39:38,931 --> 00:39:43,445
That's the emergency alert triggered by
the power dropping below 5%.

524
00:40:20,182 --> 00:40:23,149
Snow? Where are we,
upstate?

525
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:25,804
We are 5 miles outside of
Rose Hills, Tennessee.

526
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:27,952
Why?

527
00:40:28,339 --> 00:40:33,014
Jarvis! Not my idea! What are we
doing here, this is

528
00:40:33,015 --> 00:40:34,893
thousands of miles away? I've gotta get
Pepper, I've got to -

529
00:40:35,794 --> 00:40:37,084
I prepared a flight plan.

530
00:40:37,085 --> 00:40:38,538
This was the location.

531
00:40:38,592 --> 00:40:40,814
Who asked you? Open
the suit.

532
00:40:40,815 --> 00:40:43,550
I think I may be malfunctioning, sir.

533
00:40:43,551 --> 00:40:44,551
Open Eject.

534
00:40:50,977 --> 00:40:52,056
That's brisk!

535
00:41:00,187 --> 00:41:02,044
Maybe I'll just cozy back
up for a bit.

536
00:41:02,045 --> 00:41:05,155
I actually think I need
to sleep now, sir.

537
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:05,983
Jarvis.

538
00:41:08,488 --> 00:41:09,758
Jarvis?

539
00:41:12,993 --> 00:41:14,263
Don't leave me, buddy.

540
00:41:35,788 --> 00:41:39,775
Stark Secure Server: Now transferring
to all known receivers.

541
00:41:39,824 --> 00:41:40,993
Pepper, it's me.

542
00:41:41,793 --> 00:41:46,088
I've got a lot of apologies to make and not
a lot of time, so first off.

543
00:41:46,988 --> 00:41:48,597
I'm so sorry I put you
in harm's way.

544
00:41:48,598 --> 00:41:50,926
That was selfish and stupid and
it won't happen again.

545
00:41:51,628 --> 00:41:55,386
Also, it's Christmas time. The
rabbit's too big. Done.

546
00:41:55,406 --> 00:41:56,916
Sorry.

547
00:41:56,926 --> 00:42:01,450
And I'm sorry in advance because...
I can't come home yet.

548
00:42:02,994 --> 00:42:06,528
I need to find this guy. You
gotta stay safe.

549
00:42:06,529 --> 00:42:07,988
That's all I know.

550
00:42:08,648 --> 00:42:11,255
I just stole a poncho from
a wooden Indian.

551
00:42:35,787 --> 00:42:37,386
Let's get you comfy.

552
00:42:39,477 --> 00:42:40,844
You happy now?

553
00:42:52,837 --> 00:42:53,993
Freeze!

554
00:42:55,061 --> 00:42:58,260
- Don't move.
- You got me.

555
00:43:00,641 --> 00:43:01,886
Nice potato gun.

556
00:43:02,786 --> 00:43:04,129
Barrel's a little long.

557
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:08,023
Between that and the wide gauge, it's
going to diminish your FPS.

558
00:43:12,065 --> 00:43:13,610
And now you're out of ammo.

559
00:43:14,211 --> 00:43:15,628
What's that thing on
your chest?

560
00:43:17,042 --> 00:43:21,077
It's a electromagnet. You should know, you've
got a box of them right here.

561
00:43:21,517 --> 00:43:22,853
What does it power?

562
00:43:31,707 --> 00:43:33,043
Oh my God!

563
00:43:38,113 --> 00:43:41,720
- Is that Iron Man?
- Technically, I am.

564
00:43:41,721 --> 00:43:44,802
Technically, you're dead.

565
00:43:46,516 --> 00:43:49,262
- A valid point.
- What happened to him?

566
00:43:49,263 --> 00:43:52,007
Life. I built him. I take
care of him.

567
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:57,010
I'll fix him.

568
00:43:57,011 --> 00:43:58,174
- Like a mechanic.
- Yeah.

569
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:03,100
If I was building Iron Man
and War Machine,

570
00:44:03,101 --> 00:44:05,572
- It's Iron Patriot now.
- That's way cooler!

571
00:44:05,573 --> 00:44:06,734
No, it's not.

572
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:10,709
Anyway, I would have
added in the retro-

573
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:13,513
- Retroreflective panels?
- To make him stealth mode.

574
00:44:13,514 --> 00:44:14,846
- You want a stealth mode?
- Cool, right?

575
00:44:14,847 --> 00:44:17,375
That's actually a good idea.
Maybe I'll build one.

576
00:44:18,253 --> 00:44:19,658
Not a good idea!

577
00:44:19,659 --> 00:44:21,731
What are you doing? You're going
to break his finger?

578
00:44:21,732 --> 00:44:23,649
He's in pain. He's been injured.
Leave him alone.

579
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:25,540
- Sorry.
- Are you?

580
00:44:27,417 --> 00:44:29,209
Don't worry about it.
I'll fix it.

581
00:44:29,783 --> 00:44:31,048
So, uh, who's home?

582
00:44:31,049 --> 00:44:36,108
Well, my mom already left for the diner and
dad went to 7-11 to get scratchers.

583
00:44:36,494 --> 00:44:39,404
I guess he won 'cause that
was six years ago.

584
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:44,586
Which happens, dads leave. No need to
be a pussy about it.

585
00:44:44,587 --> 00:44:49,115
Here's what I need: a laptop, a
digital watch, a cell phone,

586
00:44:49,116 --> 00:44:52,206
The pneumatic actuator from
your bazooka over there,

587
00:44:52,207 --> 00:44:55,072
a map of town, a big spring,
and a tunafish sandwich.

588
00:44:55,073 --> 00:44:58,984
- What's in it for me?
- Salvation. What's his name?

589
00:44:58,985 --> 00:45:02,776
- Who?
- The kid that bullies you at school, what's his name?

590
00:45:02,777 --> 00:45:05,294
How'd you know that?

591
00:45:05,374 --> 00:45:07,053
I got just the thing.

592
00:45:09,316 --> 00:45:14,183
This is a pinata for a cricket. I'm kidding.
it's a very powerful weapon.

593
00:45:14,585 --> 00:45:17,197
Point it away from your face,
press the button on top,

594
00:45:17,244 --> 00:45:18,936
It discourages bullying.

595
00:45:19,339 --> 00:45:21,990
Non-lethal, just to cover
one's ass.

596
00:45:22,061 --> 00:45:26,792
- Deal. Deal? What'd you say?
- Deal.

597
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:30,095
- What's your name?
- Harley

598
00:45:30,096 --> 00:45:31,246
Tony

599
00:45:33,457 --> 00:45:35,309
You know what keeps going
through my head?

600
00:45:35,909 --> 00:45:37,550
Where's my sandwich?

601
00:46:15,665 --> 00:46:18,906
Stark Secure Server. Retinal
scan verified.

602
00:46:19,202 --> 00:46:20,287
Pepper, it's me.

603
00:46:20,578 --> 00:46:22,363
I've got a lot of apologies
to make

604
00:46:22,364 --> 00:46:24,098
and not a lot of time,
so first off.

605
00:46:24,437 --> 00:46:26,376
I'm so sorry I put you
in harm's way.

606
00:46:26,377 --> 00:46:29,131
That was selfish and stupid and
it won't happen again.

607
00:46:31,398 --> 00:46:33,729
Why were you at the
house tonight?

608
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:37,191
What was so important that you
had to speak to Tony?

609
00:46:40,059 --> 00:46:42,766
I think that my boss is working
for the Mandarin.

610
00:46:44,603 --> 00:46:46,286
So if you still want
to talk about it,

611
00:46:46,287 --> 00:46:48,469
I suggest we get ourselves
someplace safe.

612
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:52,973
Your boss works for the
Mandarin you think,

613
00:46:52,974 --> 00:46:55,864
but Tony says you're a botanist.

614
00:46:55,865 --> 00:46:59,355
That figures. What I actually am is a biological
DNA coder running a team of

615
00:46:59,356 --> 00:47:02,892
40 out of a privately-funded think tank, but
sure you can call me a "botanist".

616
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:08,249
This boss of yours, does
he have a name?

617
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:09,837
Yeah, Aldrich Killian.

618
00:47:12,646 --> 00:47:15,691
Well we took the house down sir, but
there's no sign of a body.

619
00:47:15,891 --> 00:47:17,303
- I see.
- No Stark.

620
00:47:17,403 --> 00:47:18,577
I have to go.

621
00:47:19,412 --> 00:47:21,835
The Master is about to record
and he's a little...

622
00:47:23,035 --> 00:47:24,382
Well you know how he gets.

623
00:47:24,458 --> 00:47:27,376
Keep your appointment tonight and
call me when it's done.

624
00:47:33,265 --> 00:47:35,863
Alright everybody. No talking and
no eye contact,

625
00:47:35,864 --> 00:47:37,837
unless you wanna get
shot in the face.

626
00:47:58,591 --> 00:48:00,258
The Master is travelling.

627
00:48:14,943 --> 00:48:16,942
Well then, what are we waiting for?

628
00:48:19,797 --> 00:48:22,043
The sandwich was fair, the
spring was a little

629
00:48:22,044 --> 00:48:24,194
rusty, the rest of the materials
I'll make do.

630
00:48:25,016 --> 00:48:27,559
By the way, when you said your
sister had a watch, I

631
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,851
was kinda hoping for something
a little more than that.

632
00:48:30,326 --> 00:48:33,553
She's six! Anyway, it's limited edition.

633
00:48:34,152 --> 00:48:37,739
- When can we talk about New York?
- Maybe never, relax about it.

634
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:39,307
- What about the Avengers, can you talk about them?
- I don't know. later.

635
00:48:39,308 --> 00:48:40,538
Hey kid, give me more space.

636
00:48:45,203 --> 00:48:48,862
What's the official story here?
What happened?

637
00:48:49,087 --> 00:48:53,021
I guess this guy named Chad Davis,
used to live roundabouts.

638
00:48:54,619 --> 00:48:56,812
Won a bunch of medals in the army.

639
00:48:57,049 --> 00:49:01,103
One day, folks said he went crazy
and made, you know, a bomb.

640
00:49:01,698 --> 00:49:04,623
Then he blew himself
up right here.

641
00:49:10,293 --> 00:49:12,540
- Six people died, right?
- Yes.

642
00:49:12,541 --> 00:49:14,190
- Including Chad Davis?
- Yea.

643
00:49:22,688 --> 00:49:24,021
Doesn't make sense.

644
00:49:24,971 --> 00:49:28,214
Think about it. Six dead,
only five shadows.

645
00:49:28,297 --> 00:49:33,539
Yeah, but people said these shadows are
like the mark of souls gone to Heaven

646
00:49:34,102 --> 00:49:39,542
Except the bomb guy, he went to Hell on
account of he didn't get a shadow.

647
00:49:39,896 --> 00:49:43,045
- That's why there's only five.
- Do you buy that?

648
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:44,645
That's what everyone says.

649
00:49:47,882 --> 00:49:50,618
You know what this crater
reminds me of?

650
00:49:50,619 --> 00:49:52,654
I have no idea. I don't care.

651
00:49:54,076 --> 00:49:59,434
That giant wormhole, in
um, in New York.

652
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,781
Does it remind you?

653
00:50:01,582 --> 00:50:03,505
That's manipulative. I don't want
to talk about it.

654
00:50:03,506 --> 00:50:05,951
Are they coming back?
The aliens?

655
00:50:05,952 --> 00:50:07,513
Maybe, can you stop?

656
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:10,894
Remember when I told you that
I have an anxiety issue?

657
00:50:10,895 --> 00:50:12,963
Does this subject make
you edgy?

658
00:50:12,964 --> 00:50:13,485
Yeah, a little bit.

659
00:50:13,486 --> 00:50:15,736
Can I just catch my breath
for a second?

660
00:50:15,737 --> 00:50:19,774
Are there bad guys in Rose Hills? Do you need
a plastic bag to breathe into?

661
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:21,410
- Do you have medication?
- Nope.

662
00:50:21,695 --> 00:50:23,032
- Do you need to be on it?
- Probably.

663
00:50:23,033 --> 00:50:25,070
- Do you have PTSD?
- I don't think so.

664
00:50:25,071 --> 00:50:26,786
Are you going completely
mental?

665
00:50:26,787 --> 00:50:28,771
I can stop, do you want
me to stop?

666
00:50:28,772 --> 00:50:30,536
Remember when I said
to stop doing that?

667
00:50:30,537 --> 00:50:32,474
I swear to God, you're going
to freak me out.

668
00:50:34,516 --> 00:50:36,574
Ah man, you did it, didn't you?

669
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:38,829
- You happy now?
- What did I say?

670
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:43,143
Hey, wait up!
Wait, wait.

671
00:50:48,203 --> 00:50:49,921
What the hell was that?

672
00:50:53,814 --> 00:50:56,277
Your fault, you spazzed
me out.

673
00:50:57,842 --> 00:50:59,847
Okay, back to business.
Where were we?

674
00:51:00,373 --> 00:51:05,151
The guy who died... relatives?Mom?
Ms. Davis, where is she?

675
00:51:05,159 --> 00:51:08,160
- Where she always is.
- See, now you're being helpful.

676
00:51:13,925 --> 00:51:18,967
Sorry. Lady, this uh,

677
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:21,978
Thank you.

678
00:51:24,301 --> 00:51:25,602
Nice haircut, suits you.

679
00:51:27,371 --> 00:51:29,874
- Nice watch.
- Yeah, limited edition.

680
00:51:30,274 --> 00:51:31,762
Oh, I don't doubt it.

681
00:51:33,419 --> 00:51:35,078
Well have a good evening.

682
00:51:58,178 --> 00:52:02,015
Ms. Davis, Mind if
I join you?

683
00:52:02,072 --> 00:52:04,623
- Free country.
- It sure is.

684
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:10,749
Alright

685
00:52:12,693 --> 00:52:16,964
- Where'd you like to start?
- I just want to say I'm sorry about your loss.

686
00:52:17,517 --> 00:52:19,551
I want to know what you
think happened

687
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:27,455
I brought your damn file.
You take it and go.

688
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:30,680
Whatever was in here, he
wanted no part of it.

689
00:52:32,211 --> 00:52:36,157
Clearly, you were waiting for someone else.
Supposed to meet somebody here?

690
00:52:37,158 --> 00:52:38,168
Yeah.

691
00:52:51,519 --> 00:52:55,087
Ms. Davis, your son didn't kill
himself. I guarantee

692
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:59,078
you he didn't kill anyone.
Someone used him.

693
00:53:00,126 --> 00:53:03,393
- What?
- As a weapon.

694
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:10,649
You're not the person who called
me after all, are you?

695
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:13,604
Actually, I am.

696
00:53:16,679 --> 00:53:20,478
Hey, hey! What's all this about?
The hell's going on here?

697
00:53:20,479 --> 00:53:22,187
It's called an arrest.

698
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:26,300
- Sheriff, is it?
- Yes ma'am, it is. And you are?

699
00:53:26,301 --> 00:53:30,744
- Homeland Security. We good here?
- No, we're not good.

700
00:53:30,745 --> 00:53:34,747
- I need a little more information than that.
- Well, I think it's a little above your pay grade, Sheriff.

701
00:53:34,748 --> 00:53:39,049
Yeah, well, why don't you get on the
horn to Nashville and upgrade me?

702
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:42,111
Alright, you know what, I was hoping
to do this the smart way, but uh,

703
00:53:42,231 --> 00:53:44,392
The fun way's always good.

704
00:53:45,593 --> 00:53:46,794
Deputy, get this woman and-

705
00:54:00,882 --> 00:54:03,602
Hey hot wings, you wanna party?
You and me, let's go.

706
00:54:16,636 --> 00:54:18,739
- Crazy, huh?
- Yeah.

707
00:54:20,759 --> 00:54:21,500
Watch this.

708
00:55:27,438 --> 00:55:30,280
You walked right into this one. I've dated
hotter chicks than you.

709
00:55:32,321 --> 00:55:36,564
That's all you got? Cheap trick
and a cheesy one-liner?

710
00:55:36,565 --> 00:55:38,926
Sweetheart, that could be the name
of my autobiography.

711
00:56:40,961 --> 00:56:43,002
- Let me go!
- Help me! Help me!

712
00:56:49,207 --> 00:56:51,688
Hey kid, what would you
like for Christmas?

713
00:56:51,689 --> 00:56:53,389
Mr. Stark, I am so sorry.

714
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:56,530
No, no, I think he was trying to say
"I want my goddamn file."

715
00:56:56,852 --> 00:56:58,813
It's not your fault kid.

716
00:57:01,013 --> 00:57:02,754
Remember what I told you
about bullies?

717
00:57:08,577 --> 00:57:11,979
You like that, West World? That's
the thing about smart guys.

718
00:57:12,539 --> 00:57:14,661
We always cover our ass.

719
00:57:38,834 --> 00:57:40,715
You're welcome!

720
00:57:41,997 --> 00:57:45,459
- For what? Did I miss something?
- Me saving your life.

721
00:57:45,559 --> 00:57:48,060
A: Saved you first
B: Thanks, sort of

722
00:57:48,602 --> 00:57:51,222
And C: If you do someone a solid, don't
be a yutz alright,

723
00:57:51,223 --> 00:57:53,744
just play it cool otherwise you
come off grandiose.

724
00:57:55,445 --> 00:57:57,086
Unlike you?

725
00:57:58,207 --> 00:58:01,349
Admit it: you need me.
We're connected.

726
00:58:01,488 --> 00:58:03,750
What I need is for you to go home,
be with your mom,

727
00:58:03,751 --> 00:58:06,611
keep your trap shut, and
guard the suit.

728
00:58:06,612 --> 00:58:08,327
And stay connected to the
telephone because

729
00:58:08,328 --> 00:58:09,632
if I call you better
pick up. Okay?

730
00:58:09,633 --> 00:58:12,334
Can you feel that?
We're done here.

731
00:58:12,796 --> 00:58:15,437
Move out of the way or I'm going to
run you over. Bye kid.

732
00:58:22,546 --> 00:58:26,108
I'm sorry kid. You
did good.

733
00:58:26,109 --> 00:58:29,409
So now you're just going to leave
you here, like my dad?

734
00:58:30,425 --> 00:58:34,652
Yeah. Wait, you're guilt-tripping
me, aren't you?

735
00:58:34,653 --> 00:58:36,409
I'm cold

736
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:39,491
I can tell. You know how I can tell?

737
00:58:39,911 --> 00:58:41,252
'Cause we're connected.

738
00:58:45,555 --> 00:58:47,635
It was worth a shot.

739
00:59:05,567 --> 00:59:07,507
What happened to the picture?

740
00:59:16,972 --> 00:59:19,494
The entire East coast.. the
satellites are down.

741
00:59:21,875 --> 00:59:23,357
We have an unauthorized broadcast

742
00:59:23,887 --> 00:59:25,931
Mr. Vice President, I think
you should see this.

743
00:59:28,651 --> 00:59:30,502
Oh my God, not again.

744
00:59:31,704 --> 00:59:33,734
Is the President getting this?

745
00:59:44,254 --> 00:59:46,155
Mr. President.

746
00:59:46,456 --> 00:59:48,256
Only two lessons remain.

747
00:59:48,938 --> 00:59:51,738
I intend to finish this before
Christmas morning.

748
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:57,422
Meet Thomas Richards. Good strong
name, good strong job.

749
00:59:58,783 --> 01:00:03,386
Thomas here is an accountant for
the Roxxon Oil Corporation.

750
01:00:06,787 --> 01:00:08,710
And I'm sure he's a
really good guy.

751
01:00:11,951 --> 01:00:16,753
I'm going to shoot him in the head, live on
your television, in 30 seconds.

752
01:00:17,635 --> 01:00:22,237
The number for this telephone is in your
cell phone. Exciting, isn't it?

753
01:00:22,517 --> 01:00:24,598
Imagining how it got there.

754
01:00:24,797 --> 01:00:31,022
America, if your president calls me in
the next half-minute, Tom lives.

755
01:00:31,322 --> 01:00:32,282
Go.

756
01:00:34,565 --> 01:00:35,819
How did he hack my phone?

757
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:37,726
We can't allow terrorists
to dictate

758
01:00:37,727 --> 01:00:38,933
I have to make this call.

759
01:00:38,934 --> 01:00:40,527
I'd strongly advise
against that.

760
01:00:40,528 --> 01:00:42,128
This is the right
thing to do.

761
01:01:10,024 --> 01:01:12,497
There's just one lesson left,
President Ellis,

762
01:01:12,498 --> 01:01:14,706
so run away and kiss your
children goodbye

763
01:01:14,707 --> 01:01:16,844
Because nothing, not your army,
not your red,

764
01:01:16,845 --> 01:01:18,750
white, and blue attack dog,
can save you.

765
01:01:22,392 --> 01:01:23,592
I'll see you soon.

766
01:01:26,434 --> 01:01:29,245
Tell Rhodes, find this lunatic
right now.

767
01:01:29,246 --> 01:01:31,917
Sir, we tracked the broadcast signal.

768
01:01:31,918 --> 01:01:34,836
We have a possible point of origin in Pakistan
and the Patriot is ready to strike.

769
01:01:34,837 --> 01:01:35,680
- Right now!
- Yes, sir.

770
01:02:07,339 --> 01:02:08,298
Don't move!

771
01:02:15,503 --> 01:02:16,504
Uh, hang on a second.

772
01:02:17,544 --> 01:02:18,256
Hello.

773
01:02:18,257 --> 01:02:23,505
You ever look up and everything starts glowing from
the inside out, a kind of bright orange.

774
01:02:24,107 --> 01:02:26,550
- Yeah, I've had that. Who is this?
- It's me, pal.

775
01:02:26,551 --> 01:02:29,751
Now last time I went missing, if I remember
correctly, you went looking for me.

776
01:02:29,752 --> 01:02:32,869
- What are you doing?
- A little talking, making friends in Pakistan.

777
01:02:32,870 --> 01:02:34,175
What are you doing?

778
01:02:34,176 --> 01:02:37,556
Your re-design, your big re-brand,
that was AIM, right? - Yeah.

779
01:02:38,156 --> 01:02:41,838
I'm gonna find a heavy-duty comsat
right now, I need your login.

780
01:02:42,178 --> 01:02:44,017
Same as it's always been,
War Machine 68.

781
01:02:44,018 --> 01:02:44,980
And password please?

782
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:47,567
Well, look, I gotta change it every time
you hack in, Tony.

783
01:02:47,568 --> 01:02:50,602
It's not the eighties, nobody says "hack"
anymore, give me your login.

784
01:02:52,124 --> 01:02:55,186
"War Machine Rox" with
an X, all caps.

785
01:02:58,688 --> 01:03:02,890
- Yeah okay.
- That is so much better than Iron Patriot.

786
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:46,542
That ain't gonna cut it.

787
01:03:49,223 --> 01:03:51,385
Excuse me sir, I don't know who...

788
01:03:54,106 --> 01:03:56,788
Mom, I need to call you back. Something
magical is happening.

789
01:03:57,508 --> 01:03:59,445
- Tony Stark is in my van.
- Keep it down.

790
01:03:59,446 --> 01:04:01,430
- Tony Stark is in my van!
- No, he's not.

791
01:04:01,431 --> 01:04:02,826
I knew you were still alive!

792
01:04:02,827 --> 01:04:04,472
Come on in and close the door.

793
01:04:09,515 --> 01:04:11,077
- Wow, can I just say sir?
- Yeah.

794
01:04:12,397 --> 01:04:13,342
I am your biggest fan.

795
01:04:13,343 --> 01:04:15,880
First, is this your van or
is anyone else gonna come in?

796
01:04:15,881 --> 01:04:17,069
No, no, it's just us.

797
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:18,200
What's your name?

798
01:04:18,201 --> 01:04:19,395
- Gary.
- Gary.

799
01:04:20,621 --> 01:04:21,721
Oh wow.

800
01:04:21,722 --> 01:04:25,764
Right there's fine. I get a
lot of this, it's okay.

801
01:04:25,765 --> 01:04:27,084
Can I just say?

802
01:04:27,085 --> 01:04:30,849
- Yeah.
- I don't know if you can tell but I have like

803
01:04:31,369 --> 01:04:34,353
Patterned my whole look after you. My
hair's a little,

804
01:04:34,354 --> 01:04:37,011
it's not right because there's
some product in it.

805
01:04:37,012 --> 01:04:37,171
Right.

806
01:04:38,932 --> 01:04:41,247
I don't want to make things
awkward for you

807
01:04:41,248 --> 01:04:43,455
- No.
- But I do have to show you... boom!

808
01:04:44,697 --> 01:04:46,197
Hispanic Scott Baio?

809
01:04:47,337 --> 01:04:48,898
- Oh, I'm sorry, is that me?
- Yeah.

810
01:04:49,298 --> 01:04:52,197
It's... I mean. I had them do it
off a doll that I made,

811
01:04:52,198 --> 01:04:55,422
so it's not like it's off a picture. So
it's a little bit-

812
01:04:55,423 --> 01:04:57,943
Jerry, for a moment, listen
to me here.

813
01:04:58,664 --> 01:05:00,613
I don't want to clip your
wings here.

814
01:05:00,614 --> 01:05:02,306
We're both a little over-excited.

815
01:05:02,626 --> 01:05:05,149
I have an issue. I'm chasing bad
guys, trying to grapple

816
01:05:05,150 --> 01:05:07,229
with something from some
hard-crypt data files.

817
01:05:07,230 --> 01:05:08,850
I don't have enough juice.

818
01:05:08,910 --> 01:05:12,711
I need you to jump on the roof,
recalibrate the ISDNs

819
01:05:13,312 --> 01:05:16,448
- Pump it up by about 40%.
- Got it.

820
01:05:16,449 --> 01:05:17,235
Alright, it's a mission.

821
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:18,034
Yeah.

822
01:05:18,035 --> 01:05:19,697
Tony needs Gary.

823
01:05:20,197 --> 01:05:21,147
And Gary needs Tony.

824
01:05:21,148 --> 01:05:22,197
Be quiet about it.

825
01:05:22,398 --> 01:05:23,498
Go.

826
01:05:46,092 --> 01:05:49,014
What would you regard as the defining
moment of your life?

827
01:05:49,333 --> 01:05:52,976
Well uh, I think that would be the day I decided
not to let my injury beat me.

828
01:05:55,337 --> 01:05:58,260
- Can you please state your name for the camera?
- Ellen Brandt.

829
01:05:58,579 --> 01:06:02,942
Okay, so, the injections are
administered periodically.

830
01:06:02,943 --> 01:06:07,425
Addiction will not be tolerated and those who cannot
regulate will be cut from the program.

831
01:06:08,626 --> 01:06:15,710
Once misfits, cripples... you are the next
iteration of human evolution.

832
01:06:19,992 --> 01:06:23,923
Hi everybody. Before we start, I promise you, looking back
at your life there will be

833
01:06:23,924 --> 01:06:28,036
nothing as bitter as the memory of that glorious risk that
you prudently elected to forego.

834
01:06:29,537 --> 01:06:31,759
Today is your glory. Let's begin!

835
01:06:43,085 --> 01:06:45,967
We gotta get out of here! Gotta get out of here!
Get 'em out! Get 'em out of here!

836
01:06:52,971 --> 01:06:55,333
A bomb is not a bomb
when it's a misfire.

837
01:06:57,773 --> 01:07:00,055
This stuff doesn't always
work, right, pal?

838
01:07:00,455 --> 01:07:02,556
It's faulty, but you found a
buyer, didn't ya?

839
01:07:03,098 --> 01:07:05,118
Sold it to the Mandarin.

840
01:07:10,661 --> 01:07:13,982
What happened? Fun fact.

841
01:07:14,985 --> 01:07:17,746
Before he built rockets
for the Nazis.

842
01:07:18,105 --> 01:07:27,070
The idealistic Werner von Braun dreamed
of space travel... he stargazed.

843
01:07:28,111 --> 01:07:32,073
You know what he said when the
first V2 hit London?

844
01:07:32,794 --> 01:07:36,116
The rocket performed perfectly.

845
01:07:37,918 --> 01:07:40,199
It just landed on the wrong planet.

846
01:07:41,919 --> 01:07:46,802
See we all begin wide-eyed...
"pure science".

847
01:07:47,322 --> 01:07:51,565
Then the ego steps in,
the obsession

848
01:07:53,126 --> 01:07:59,368
And when you look up, you're
a long way from shore.

849
01:08:00,130 --> 01:08:06,534
You can't be too hard on yourself, Maya. I mean
you gave your research to a think tank.

850
01:08:06,535 --> 01:08:09,967
Yeah but Killian built that think tank
on military contracts.

851
01:08:09,968 --> 01:08:11,937
That's exactly what we used to do.

852
01:08:12,498 --> 01:08:14,059
So don't judge yourself.

853
01:08:16,019 --> 01:08:17,499
Thank you, Pepper.

854
01:08:19,421 --> 01:08:20,942
I really appreciate that.

855
01:08:28,827 --> 01:08:29,342
Hi, good evening

856
01:08:29,343 --> 01:08:30,608
- Good evening.
- Come on in.

857
01:08:32,988 --> 01:08:34,150
Maya, run!

858
01:08:36,471 --> 01:08:37,592
Hi Pepper.

859
01:08:39,833 --> 01:08:42,033
So you want to tell me why you were
at Stark's manison last night?

860
01:08:42,114 --> 01:08:45,515
I'm trying to fix this thing. I didn't know you and
the Master were gonna blow the place up.

861
01:08:46,037 --> 01:08:50,017
Oh I see, so you were trying to save Stark...
when he threatened us

862
01:08:50,018 --> 01:08:51,441
I told you, Killian, we can use him.

863
01:08:53,281 --> 01:08:54,565
Pepper, Pepper, Pepper

864
01:08:54,566 --> 01:08:58,125
Look if we want to launch product
next year, I need Stark.

865
01:08:58,485 --> 01:09:01,584
He just lacked a decent incentive.
Now he has one.

866
01:09:06,356 --> 01:09:11,589
This is Support Team Blue 0, sending coordinates for
suspected Mandarin broadcast point of origin.

867
01:09:11,590 --> 01:09:12,165
Copy.

868
01:09:20,498 --> 01:09:21,577
Nobody move!

869
01:09:26,501 --> 01:09:29,608
Support Blue 0, unless the Mandarin's
next attack on the U.S.

870
01:09:29,609 --> 01:09:32,664
involves cheaply-made sportswear, I think
you messed up again.

871
01:09:34,185 --> 01:09:39,147
Yes, you're free, if you weren't
before. Yes ma'am.

872
01:09:39,348 --> 01:09:43,110
Iron Patriot on the job, happy to help,no need
to thank me, it's my pleasure.

873
01:09:52,156 --> 01:09:54,658
Savin, I've acquired the Patriot armor.

874
01:09:54,659 --> 01:09:58,599
You want this suit? You're going ot have
to pry my cold, dead body out of it.

875
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,080
That's the plan, Colonel.

876
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:03,976
Harley, tell me what is happening,
give me a full report.

877
01:10:04,077 --> 01:10:07,684
Yeah, I'm still eating that candy, do you
want me to keep eating it?

878
01:10:08,085 --> 01:10:09,085
How much did you have?

879
01:10:09,086 --> 01:10:10,086
Two or three bowls.

880
01:10:10,087 --> 01:10:12,391
- Can you still see straight?
- Sort of.

881
01:10:12,392 --> 01:10:14,367
That means you're fine,
give me Jarvis.

882
01:10:14,809 --> 01:10:15,870
Jarvis, how are we?

883
01:10:15,871 --> 01:10:18,296
It's totally fine sir. I seem to do quite
well for a stretch and

884
01:10:18,297 --> 01:10:20,492
then at the end of the sentence I
say the wrong cranberry.

885
01:10:20,872 --> 01:10:24,219
And sir, you were right. Once I factored
in available AIM downlink

886
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:27,516
facilities I was able to pinpoint the
Mandarin's broadcast signal.

887
01:10:28,216 --> 01:10:32,319
What're we talkin'? The Far East, Europe, North
Africa, Iran, Pakistan, Syria, where is it?

888
01:10:32,619 --> 01:10:33,940
Actually, sir, it's in Miami.

889
01:10:33,941 --> 01:10:37,551
Okay, kid, I'm going to have to walk
you through rebooting Jarvis's

890
01:10:37,552 --> 01:10:39,683
speech drive, but not right now.

891
01:10:40,108 --> 01:10:41,183
Harley, where is he really?

892
01:10:41,184 --> 01:10:42,865
Just look on the screen and
tell me where it is.

893
01:10:44,626 --> 01:10:46,071
Um...it does say Miami, Florida.

894
01:10:46,072 --> 01:10:48,628
Okay, first things first,
I need the armor.

895
01:10:48,868 --> 01:10:50,142
Where are we at with it?

896
01:10:50,143 --> 01:10:51,310
Uh, it's not charging.

897
01:10:58,234 --> 01:11:02,019
Actually, sir, it is charging, but the power
source is questionable.

898
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:04,558
It may not succeed in revitalizing
the Mark 42.

899
01:11:04,559 --> 01:11:06,848
What's questionable about electricity?

900
01:11:06,849 --> 01:11:09,961
Alright, it's my suit and I can't...
I'm not gonna...

901
01:11:11,001 --> 01:11:14,363
- Oh God, not again.
- Tony

902
01:11:16,325 --> 01:11:19,546
Are you having another attack? I didn't even
mention New York.

903
01:11:19,547 --> 01:11:23,329
Right, and then you just said it, by name,
while denying having said it.

904
01:11:23,330 --> 01:11:24,509
Okay, um, uh

905
01:11:27,252 --> 01:11:28,864
Oh God, what am I gonna do?

906
01:11:28,865 --> 01:11:31,013
Just breathe, really just breathe.

907
01:11:32,214 --> 01:11:35,736
- You're a mechanic, right?
- Right.

908
01:11:36,936 --> 01:11:40,297
- You said so.
- Yes, I did.

909
01:11:41,258 --> 01:11:43,300
What don't you just build something?

910
01:11:56,108 --> 01:11:58,909
Okay, thanks kid.

911
01:13:42,930 --> 01:13:47,173
Why is it so hot in here? I told
you to put it at 68.

912
01:13:47,973 --> 01:13:51,775
My fault again...let me tell you something
sweetheart, I am not your personal-

913
01:14:54,892 --> 01:14:56,774
I wouldn't go in there for twenty minutes!

914
01:14:58,194 --> 01:15:01,416
- Now, which one of you is Vanessa?
- That's me.

915
01:15:01,429 --> 01:15:03,631
Ah, Nessie.

916
01:15:03,917 --> 01:15:08,503
Did you know that fortune cookies
aren't even Chinese?

917
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:10,921
There's some guy over here.

918
01:15:10,922 --> 01:15:14,344
They're made by Americans, based
on the Japanese recipes. - Hey!

919
01:15:16,471 --> 01:15:18,472
Bloody hell. Bloody hell.

920
01:15:18,497 --> 01:15:20,098
- Don't move.
- I am not moving.

921
01:15:20,107 --> 01:15:22,793
If you want something, take it, although
the guns are all fake

922
01:15:22,794 --> 01:15:25,310
because those wankers wouldn't trust
me with the real ones.

923
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:27,691
- What?
- Hey, do you fancy either of the birds?

924
01:15:28,252 --> 01:15:32,794
Heard enough. You're not him, the Mandarin,
the real guy, where?

925
01:15:33,795 --> 01:15:38,117
- Where's the Mandarin? Where is he?
- He's here. He's here.

926
01:15:38,337 --> 01:15:41,139
- But he's not here. He's here but he's not here.
- What do you mean?

927
01:15:41,239 --> 01:15:43,626
It's complicated, hey, it's
complicated, alright?

928
01:15:43,627 --> 01:15:44,961
- It is?
- It's complicated.

929
01:15:44,962 --> 01:15:46,506
Uncomplicate it. Ladies out, get out
of the bed

930
01:15:46,507 --> 01:15:47,842
get in the bathroom.

931
01:15:50,593 --> 01:15:51,202
Sit.

932
01:16:01,050 --> 01:16:04,234
My name is Trevor, Trevor Slattery.

933
01:16:04,235 --> 01:16:05,574
What are you?

934
01:16:06,734 --> 01:16:08,761
What're you a decoy? You're
a double, right?

935
01:16:08,762 --> 01:16:10,616
What? No. An understudy?
Absolutely not.

936
01:16:11,377 --> 01:16:13,218
Don't hurt me please!
I'm an actor.

937
01:16:14,317 --> 01:16:17,071
You got a minute to live, fill it
with words.

938
01:16:17,772 --> 01:16:21,063
It's just a role. "The Mandarin", see,
it's not real.

939
01:16:21,383 --> 01:16:22,983
Then how did you get here,
Trevor?

940
01:16:25,665 --> 01:16:31,290
Um, well, uh, I have a little problem
with, um, substances,

941
01:16:31,291 --> 01:16:36,071
and I ended up doing things...
no two ways about it

942
01:16:36,072 --> 01:16:39,353
- In the street that a man shouldn't do.
- Next!

943
01:16:39,354 --> 01:16:44,756
Then, they approached me about the role
and they knew about the drugs.

944
01:16:44,757 --> 01:16:46,373
What'd they say they'd get
you off them?

945
01:16:46,374 --> 01:16:47,398
Said they'd give me more.

946
01:16:47,758 --> 01:16:50,822
They gave me things. They gave
me this palace.

947
01:16:50,823 --> 01:16:54,082
They gave me plastic surgery. They
gave me things.

948
01:16:55,803 --> 01:16:57,203
Did you just nod off?

949
01:16:58,364 --> 01:17:02,447
No, the lovely speedboat! And the
thing was, he needed someone.

950
01:17:02,848 --> 01:17:06,450
To take credit for some
"accidental explosions".

951
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:10,851
"He"?

952
01:17:13,492 --> 01:17:15,694
- Killian?
- Killian.

953
01:17:15,695 --> 01:17:18,017
- He created you?
- He created me.

954
01:17:19,217 --> 01:17:21,418
- Custom-made terror threat
- Yes!

955
01:17:22,098 --> 01:17:27,021
Yes, his think tank thinked it up, the
pathology of the serial killer.

956
01:17:27,461 --> 01:17:30,503
The manipulation of Western
iconography.

957
01:17:30,943 --> 01:17:35,147
Ready for another lesson?
Blah blah blah.

958
01:17:36,947 --> 01:17:39,907
Of course, it was my performance that
brought the Mandarin to life.

959
01:17:40,129 --> 01:17:45,472
Your performance? Where
people die?

960
01:17:46,432 --> 01:17:48,934
No, no, look around you,
costumes, green screen.

961
01:17:49,234 --> 01:17:53,476
Honestly, I wasn't on location for half this stuff,
and when I was, movie magic, love.

962
01:17:53,716 --> 01:17:57,158
I'm sorry but I got a best friend who's in
a coma and he might not wake up.

963
01:17:57,159 --> 01:18:00,641
So you're going to have to answer for that.
You're still going down, pal.

964
01:18:07,023 --> 01:18:09,826
Okay, Trevor, what'd you tell him?

965
01:18:10,527 --> 01:18:12,607
- I didn't tell him anything.
- Nothing?

966
01:18:14,128 --> 01:18:16,850
- No.
- You should have pressed the panic button.

967
01:18:17,690 --> 01:18:19,732
Well I panicked, but then
I handled it.

968
01:18:42,154 --> 01:18:43,874
Just like old times, huh?

969
01:18:43,875 --> 01:18:46,556
Oh yeah, with zip-ties.
It's a ball.

970
01:18:46,836 --> 01:18:48,100
It wasn't my idea.

971
01:18:48,101 --> 01:18:50,559
Okay, so you took
Killian's card

972
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:51,509
I took his money.

973
01:18:51,610 --> 01:18:54,321
And here you are 13 years
later in a dungeon.

974
01:18:54,521 --> 01:18:55,402
- No.
- Yeah.

975
01:18:55,502 --> 01:18:59,524
- No, you're in a dungeon. I'm free to go.
- Yeah...

976
01:19:03,406 --> 01:19:07,759
A lot's happened Tony,
and I'm close.

977
01:19:08,049 --> 01:19:11,110
Extremis is pratically stable.

978
01:19:11,111 --> 01:19:11,450
I'm telling you it isn't.

979
01:19:11,451 --> 01:19:16,114
I saw him on the street, people are going 'bang', they're
painting the walls. Maya, you're kidding yourself.

980
01:19:16,115 --> 01:19:18,995
Then help me fix it.

981
01:19:23,019 --> 01:19:24,020
Did I do that?

982
01:19:26,181 --> 01:19:28,583
- Yes.
- I remember the night, not the morning

983
01:19:29,304 --> 01:19:30,484
Is this what you've been
chasing around?

984
01:19:30,485 --> 01:19:31,664
- You don't remember?
- I can't help you.

985
01:19:33,786 --> 01:19:38,989
You used to have a moral psychology.
You used to have ideals.

986
01:19:39,909 --> 01:19:43,752
Wanted to help people, now
look at you.

987
01:19:45,353 --> 01:19:47,574
I get to wake up every morning
with someone who...

988
01:19:50,301 --> 01:19:51,501
still has a soul.

989
01:19:57,881 --> 01:20:02,483
Get me out of here,
come on.

990
01:20:04,324 --> 01:20:09,407
You know what my old man used to say to me?
His favorite of many sayings.

991
01:20:10,367 --> 01:20:14,889
"The early bird gets the worm, the second
mouse gets the cheese".

992
01:20:14,890 --> 01:20:17,503
You're not still pissed about the Switzerland
thing, are you?

993
01:20:17,504 --> 01:20:18,852
How can I be pissed you, Tony?

994
01:20:19,572 --> 01:20:21,743
I'm here to thank you. You've
given me the

995
01:20:21,744 --> 01:20:24,015
greatest gift that anybody's
ever given me.

996
01:20:24,375 --> 01:20:27,787
Desperation. If you think
back to Switzerland,

997
01:20:27,788 --> 01:20:30,539
you said you'd meet me on
the rooftop, right?

998
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:36,653
Well for the first 20 minutes, I actually
thought you'd show up.

999
01:20:36,954 --> 01:20:39,003
For the next hour, I uhh...

1000
01:20:39,603 --> 01:20:46,268
Well I considered taking that one step shortcut
to the lobby, if you know I mean.

1001
01:20:46,269 --> 01:20:49,191
Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out
what happened to the first mouse.

1002
01:20:49,230 --> 01:20:53,006
But as I looked out over that city, nobody
knew I was there,

1003
01:20:53,107 --> 01:20:55,734
nobody could see me, no one
was even looking.

1004
01:20:55,934 --> 01:21:01,078
I had a thought that would guide
me for years to come.

1005
01:21:01,997 --> 01:21:03,318
Anonymity, Tony.

1006
01:21:04,799 --> 01:21:07,983
Thanks to you, it's been my mantra
ever since, right?

1007
01:21:07,984 --> 01:21:10,282
You simply rule from behind
the scenes.

1008
01:21:10,283 --> 01:21:12,604
Because the second you
give evil a face

1009
01:21:12,764 --> 01:21:16,426
Bin Laden, Gaddafi, The Mandarin

1010
01:21:16,607 --> 01:21:17,749
You hand the people a target.

1011
01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:18,727
You're something else.

1012
01:21:21,772 --> 01:21:23,049
You have met him, I assume?

1013
01:21:23,050 --> 01:21:24,373
Yeah, Sir Lawrence Oblivion.

1014
01:21:24,654 --> 01:21:27,816
I know he's a little over the top sometimes...
it's not entirely my fault.

1015
01:21:27,817 --> 01:21:29,978
He has a tend...he's
a stage actor.

1016
01:21:30,777 --> 01:21:33,339
They say his Lear was the toast of
Croydon, wherever that is.

1017
01:21:33,939 --> 01:21:38,341
Anyway, the point is ever since that big dude
with the hammer fell out of the sky.

1018
01:21:39,222 --> 01:21:41,024
Subtlety's kinda had its day.

1019
01:21:41,343 --> 01:21:42,904
What's next for you in your world?

1020
01:21:42,905 --> 01:21:47,748
Well, I wanted to repay you for the same gift
you so graciously imparted to me.

1021
01:21:55,231 --> 01:22:00,073
Desperation. Now, this is live. I'm not
sure if you can tell.

1022
01:22:00,595 --> 01:22:06,318
But at this moment the body is trying to decide
whether to accept Extremis or just give up.

1023
01:22:06,377 --> 01:22:11,999
And if it gives up, I have to say the denotation
is quite spectactular.

1024
01:22:13,882 --> 01:22:16,604
But until that point, it's really
just a lot of pain.

1025
01:22:17,323 --> 01:22:21,007
We haven't even talked
salary yet.

1026
01:22:21,807 --> 01:22:24,692
What kind of perk package
are you thinking of?

1027
01:22:24,793 --> 01:22:25,930
Let him go.

1028
01:22:27,689 --> 01:22:32,853
- Hold on, hold on. Maya
- I said let him go!

1029
01:22:33,534 --> 01:22:34,842
What are you doing?

1030
01:22:34,843 --> 01:22:38,016
1200ccs, a dose half of this
size and I'm dead.

1031
01:22:38,496 --> 01:22:42,140
It's times like this my temper
is tested somewhat.

1032
01:22:42,141 --> 01:22:44,220
Maya, give me the injector.

1033
01:22:44,221 --> 01:22:49,663
If I die Killian, what happens to your soldiers?
What happens to your product?

1034
01:22:49,664 --> 01:22:50,863
We're not doing this, okay?

1035
01:22:50,864 --> 01:22:53,305
What happens to you? What happens
if you go too hot?

1036
01:23:06,833 --> 01:23:11,236
The good news is, a high level position
has just been vacated.

1037
01:23:19,462 --> 01:23:22,482
-You're a maniac.
- No, I'm a visionary.

1038
01:23:24,444 --> 01:23:29,006
But I do own a maniac, and he takes
the stage tonight.

1039
01:23:32,728 --> 01:23:36,372
When we get the Iron Patriot, it'll take me
nine to ten minutes for a take down.

1040
01:23:37,611 --> 01:23:39,933
That's great. The last time I looked
there was somebody inside of it.

1041
01:23:46,416 --> 01:23:48,058
Afternoon, gentlemen.

1042
01:23:51,099 --> 01:23:53,780
Hello Colonel.

1043
01:23:53,781 --> 01:23:55,422
Step aside.

1044
01:24:03,547 --> 01:24:06,310
We'll get you out of there,
don't worry.

1045
01:24:06,511 --> 01:24:08,389
You'll damage the armor.

1046
01:24:08,869 --> 01:24:12,672
Yes, I will, but you can
fix it, right?

1047
01:24:13,552 --> 01:24:16,794
I'm going to take the suit up to base
camp, and I want Potts with me.

1048
01:24:17,395 --> 01:24:19,516
She's still in Phase 2.

1049
01:24:20,296 --> 01:24:22,818
You're not going deaf, are ya?

1050
01:24:38,287 --> 01:24:40,368
Careful there, it's a limited edition.

1051
01:24:40,889 --> 01:24:43,129
Hey, uh, ponytail express.

1052
01:24:43,570 --> 01:24:46,611
What is the mileage count between Tennessee
and Miami? - 832 miles.

1053
01:24:46,932 --> 01:24:48,973
Very nice.

1054
01:24:50,534 --> 01:24:53,055
- Are you gonna stop that?
- Break it you bought it.

1055
01:24:55,818 --> 01:24:59,012
Okay, that wasn't mine to give away, that
belongs to my friend's sister,

1056
01:24:59,013 --> 01:25:02,262
and that's why I'm gonna
kill you first.

1057
01:25:02,741 --> 01:25:03,862
- What're ya gonna do to me?
- You'll see.

1058
01:25:04,262 --> 01:25:07,784
- You're zip-tied to a bed.
- This.

1059
01:25:11,266 --> 01:25:12,707
That.

1060
01:25:17,029 --> 01:25:18,471
Are you comin' out?

1061
01:25:21,272 --> 01:25:25,434
Do not open, do not open, don't open, don't
open, don't- Alright, let's go.

1062
01:25:32,718 --> 01:25:35,441
You breathe fire? Okay.

1063
01:25:39,042 --> 01:25:42,044
It's a glorious day, Savin.

1064
01:25:42,364 --> 01:25:48,008
This time tomorrow, I'll have the West's most
powerful leader in one hand.

1065
01:25:48,009 --> 01:25:51,209
And the world's most feared
terrorist in the other.

1066
01:25:52,050 --> 01:25:54,171
I'll own the War on Terror.

1067
01:25:55,652 --> 01:26:00,536
Creates supply and demand for you
and your brothers and sisters.

1068
01:26:03,697 --> 01:26:08,900
Trust me, you're going in a puddle of blood on
the ground in 5, 4, 3, Come on!, 2

1069
01:26:11,461 --> 01:26:12,412
How did we get this shit?

1070
01:26:12,413 --> 01:26:15,264
Alright, I'm going to give you a chance to
escape, put down your weapons.

1071
01:26:16,264 --> 01:26:20,026
And tie yourselves into those chairs
and I'll let you live. In 5, 4

1072
01:26:22,307 --> 01:26:24,761
You should be gone by now, you
should have already been gone.

1073
01:26:24,762 --> 01:26:25,870
I'm just beyond terrified.

1074
01:26:25,871 --> 01:26:27,349
Here it comes.

1075
01:26:27,751 --> 01:26:29,353
3, 4

1076
01:26:29,354 --> 01:26:31,353
Shut up. - 54321

1077
01:26:32,152 --> 01:26:33,353
I told you.

1078
01:26:46,321 --> 01:26:47,363
Where's the rest?

1079
01:27:44,635 --> 01:27:48,638
Honestly, I hate working here...
they are so weird.

1080
01:27:54,322 --> 01:27:55,562
Better late than never.

1081
01:28:01,569 --> 01:28:03,329
Not this time. Not the face.

1082
01:28:05,187 --> 01:28:07,483
Phew, it's good to be back. Hello,
by the way.

1083
01:28:07,484 --> 01:28:08,279
Oh, hello sir.

1084
01:28:14,403 --> 01:28:16,716
All personnel, Stark is loose and
somewhere in the compound.

1085
01:28:16,717 --> 01:28:18,725
Repeat: Stark is loose and somewhere
in the compound.

1086
01:28:20,980 --> 01:28:22,541
Ah, crap.

1087
01:28:34,948 --> 01:28:37,509
- Tony.
- Rudy, tell me that was you in the suit.

1088
01:28:37,529 --> 01:28:38,809
No, you got yours?

1089
01:28:38,810 --> 01:28:42,072
Uh, um, kind of. Main house
as fast as you can.

1090
01:28:42,113 --> 01:28:43,393
Somebody I'd like you to meet.

1091
01:28:48,845 --> 01:28:50,866
You, you. Move!
Get out!

1092
01:28:50,867 --> 01:28:52,839
The room is secure. I have eyes
on the Mandarin.

1093
01:28:53,140 --> 01:28:55,349
What's this? I had winner's.

1094
01:29:03,748 --> 01:29:04,955
What've you come as?

1095
01:29:04,956 --> 01:29:07,191
Make a move and I'll break
your face.

1096
01:29:08,671 --> 01:29:12,153
I never thought people had been hurt.
They lied to me.

1097
01:29:12,834 --> 01:29:14,055
This is the Mandarin?

1098
01:29:14,056 --> 01:29:15,915
I know, it's, it's embarrassing.

1099
01:29:15,916 --> 01:29:17,877
Hi, I'm Trevor,
Trevor Slattery.

1100
01:29:17,878 --> 01:29:21,813
I know I'm shorter in person, I'm a bit small,
everyone says that but, uh, hey

1101
01:29:21,814 --> 01:29:25,360
if you're here to arrest me, there are
some people who I'd like to roll on.

1102
01:29:25,361 --> 01:29:26,541
Here's how it works,
Meryl Streep.

1103
01:29:26,542 --> 01:29:28,362
You tell him where Pepper
is and he'll stop doing it.

1104
01:29:29,002 --> 01:29:32,324
Doing what? Oh, I get it! Ow!
That hurt! I get it! I get it!

1105
01:29:32,325 --> 01:29:36,247
I do not know about any Pepper,
but I know the plan.

1106
01:29:36,248 --> 01:29:38,409
- Spill.
- Do you know what they did to my suit?

1107
01:29:38,768 --> 01:29:42,354
What? No. But I do know what's happening
off the coast.

1108
01:29:42,355 --> 01:29:46,132
Something to do with uh... a big boat.
I can take you there.

1109
01:29:50,296 --> 01:29:52,817
Tony, I swear to God, I'm going
to blow his face off.

1110
01:29:52,818 --> 01:29:56,338
Oh this next bit may include the
Vice President as well.

1111
01:29:57,380 --> 01:29:59,135
- Is that important?
- Somewhat.

1112
01:29:59,136 --> 01:30:00,422
Yeah, a little bit.

1113
01:30:03,607 --> 01:30:05,312
- So?
- Uh, what are we gonna do.

1114
01:30:05,913 --> 01:30:09,130
We don't have any transport.

1115
01:30:10,152 --> 01:30:13,555
Hey, Ringo, didn't you say something
about a "lovely speedboat"?

1116
01:30:15,976 --> 01:30:18,425
If he's right about the location, we're 20 minutes
from where Pepper is.

1117
01:30:18,426 --> 01:30:20,640
But we also have to figure out this
Vice President thing, right?

1118
01:30:21,121 --> 01:30:23,962
I wonder who I'm calling right now.
Oh, that's the Vice President.

1119
01:30:25,883 --> 01:30:28,403
- Hello.
- Sir, this is Tony Stark.

1120
01:30:29,085 --> 01:30:30,473
Welcome back to the land
of the living.

1121
01:30:30,474 --> 01:30:32,714
We believe you're about to be drawn
into the Mandarin campaign,

1122
01:30:32,715 --> 01:30:34,849
and we've got to get you somewhere safe
as soon as possible.

1123
01:30:34,928 --> 01:30:39,611
Mr. Stark, I'm about to eat honey roast ham
surrounded by the agency's finest.

1124
01:30:39,612 --> 01:30:42,712
And the President is safe on Air Force One
with Colonel Rhodes.

1125
01:30:42,812 --> 01:30:44,274
I think we're good here.

1126
01:30:44,275 --> 01:30:46,214
Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes!

1127
01:30:46,355 --> 01:30:48,233
They're using the Iron Patriot
as a trojan horse.

1128
01:30:48,334 --> 01:30:49,196
They're gonna take out

1129
01:30:49,197 --> 01:30:51,858
the President somehow. We have to
immediately alert that plane.

1130
01:30:52,058 --> 01:30:54,559
Okay, I'm on it. I'll have security
lock it down. If need be,

1131
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:57,742
they can have F22s in the air in 30 seconds.
Thank you, Colonel.

1132
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:58,734
Rhodes and Stark out.

1133
01:31:00,643 --> 01:31:01,960
Everything okay, sir?

1134
01:31:03,462 --> 01:31:04,985
Couldn't be better.

1135
01:31:11,670 --> 01:31:14,331
I love you, baby.

1136
01:31:33,722 --> 01:31:36,783
Colonel Rhodes. Glad to see
you could make it, son.

1137
01:31:36,885 --> 01:31:37,966
I feel safer already.

1138
01:31:43,568 --> 01:31:44,849
We gotta make a decision.
We can either save

1139
01:31:44,850 --> 01:31:46,850
the President or Pepper.
We can't do both.

1140
01:31:47,070 --> 01:31:48,751
Sir, I have an update
from Malibu.

1141
01:31:49,051 --> 01:31:50,957
The cranes have finally
arrived and the

1142
01:31:50,958 --> 01:31:53,054
cellar doors are being
cleared as we speak.

1143
01:31:53,614 --> 01:31:55,035
And what about the suit
I'm wearing?

1144
01:31:55,036 --> 01:31:56,736
The armor is now at 92%.

1145
01:31:57,795 --> 01:31:59,116
That's gonna have to do.

1146
01:32:08,783 --> 01:32:10,512
Oh, here he comes, here he comes,
get a quick picture.

1147
01:32:10,513 --> 01:32:10,944
Sure.

1148
01:32:28,874 --> 01:32:30,797
Is everything all right,
Colonel?

1149
01:33:01,613 --> 01:33:04,176
It is an honor,
Mr. President.

1150
01:33:04,655 --> 01:33:06,997
If you're gonna do it,
do it.

1151
01:33:07,197 --> 01:33:08,590
Woh. Cool your boots, Sir.

1152
01:33:08,591 --> 01:33:10,519
That's not how the
Mandarin works.

1153
01:33:10,589 --> 01:33:13,190
Sir. Air Force One's
been compromised.

1154
01:33:13,330 --> 01:33:15,104
Internal shots, temperature
spikes.

1155
01:33:15,105 --> 01:33:16,267
Get me eyes on it now.

1156
01:33:16,268 --> 01:33:17,913
Image coming through
now, Sir.

1157
01:33:20,596 --> 01:33:22,936
Is that Rhodes?

1158
01:33:51,253 --> 01:33:54,253
The President.
Now.

1159
01:33:54,735 --> 01:33:56,216
He's not here.

1160
01:33:59,739 --> 01:34:01,703
Try the jet stream.

1161
01:34:03,405 --> 01:34:05,501
Speaking of which,
go fish!

1162
01:34:27,854 --> 01:34:30,295
Walk away from that, you
son of a bitch.

1163
01:34:42,963 --> 01:34:45,605
- How many in the air?
- Thirteen, sir.

1164
01:34:47,066 --> 01:34:48,866
- How many can I carry
- Four, sir.

1165
01:34:58,873 --> 01:35:02,136
Slow down, slow down. Relax, what's
your name? Heather..

1166
01:35:10,140 --> 01:35:12,674
Listen to me, see
that guy?

1167
01:35:12,675 --> 01:35:14,093
I'm gonna swing
by him

1168
01:35:14,094 --> 01:35:15,184
and you're just gonna
grab him.

1169
01:35:15,384 --> 01:35:16,603
You got it?

1170
01:35:18,566 --> 01:35:20,557
I will electrify your arm,

1171
01:35:20,558 --> 01:35:22,326
you won't be able to open
your hand.

1172
01:35:23,752 --> 01:35:24,952
You can do this,
Heather.

1173
01:35:33,773 --> 01:35:36,514
Easy, see? Eleven
more to go.

1174
01:35:39,376 --> 01:35:41,272
Remember that game called
Barrel of Monkeys?

1175
01:35:41,273 --> 01:35:42,579
That's what we're
going to do.

1176
01:35:42,580 --> 01:35:43,451
18,000 feet.

1177
01:35:44,052 --> 01:35:46,021
Come on, people! Everybody, grab
your monkey!

1178
01:35:50,702 --> 01:35:53,985
- Nice!
- 10,000 feet.

1179
01:35:57,227 --> 01:35:59,188
- 6,000 feet.
- Come on, people.

1180
01:36:00,029 --> 01:36:01,670
Come on, come on, come on

1181
01:36:05,513 --> 01:36:08,875
- Yeah!
- 1000 feet.

1182
01:36:10,395 --> 01:36:13,140
400 feet. 200 feet,
sir.

1183
01:36:13,141 --> 01:36:15,018
It's a tricky monkey,
let's get him.

1184
01:36:15,358 --> 01:36:17,119
Hello.

1185
01:36:39,612 --> 01:36:41,341
Nice work guys.
Excellent.

1186
01:36:41,342 --> 01:36:43,734
Good team effort all around.
Go us.

1187
01:36:44,375 --> 01:36:46,896
Alright, Jarvis, but it's only half done,
we still gotta get Pepp-

1188
01:36:54,901 --> 01:36:57,423
That came out of nowhere.

1189
01:36:58,263 --> 01:36:59,180
Gimme some good
news man.

1190
01:36:59,181 --> 01:37:00,685
- I think they all made it.
- Thank God.

1191
01:37:00,904 --> 01:37:02,744
Yeah, but I missed the President.

1192
01:37:03,146 --> 01:37:04,663
You couldn't save the President
with the suit,

1193
01:37:04,664 --> 01:37:05,987
how are you gonna save Pepper
without it?

1194
01:37:06,828 --> 01:37:08,759
Uh, say Jarvis, is it
that time?

1195
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:10,870
The "house party"
protocol, sir?

1196
01:37:10,871 --> 01:37:11,971
Correct.

1197
01:37:42,866 --> 01:37:44,746
Hi.

1198
01:37:51,151 --> 01:37:55,653
You think he's gonna help you...
he won't.

1199
01:38:00,396 --> 01:38:03,213
Having you here is not just
to motivate Tony Stark,

1200
01:38:03,514 --> 01:38:06,580
it's actually more embarrassing
than that.

1201
01:38:07,279 --> 01:38:12,082
- You're here as my, um
- Trophy.

1202
01:38:24,049 --> 01:38:26,169
Good evening, sir.

1203
01:38:30,173 --> 01:38:32,094
Welcome aboard,
Mr. President.

1204
01:38:41,419 --> 01:38:44,144
You ever heard of an elephant
graveyard?

1205
01:38:44,145 --> 01:38:48,423
Well, two years ago, the elephant in
the room was this scow.

1206
01:38:51,174 --> 01:38:52,134
This is the Roxxon Norco.

1207
01:38:52,434 --> 01:38:55,837
Of course you remember when she spilled 100
million gallons of crude off Pensacola.

1208
01:38:55,896 --> 01:38:58,458
Thanks to you, not one fat
cat saw a day in court.

1209
01:38:59,038 --> 01:39:00,359
What do you want from me?

1210
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:03,302
Uh, nothing, sir.

1211
01:39:03,341 --> 01:39:06,464
I just needed a reason to kill you
that would play well on TV.

1212
01:39:07,032 --> 01:39:11,595
You see, I've moved on. I've found myself
a new political patron, and

1213
01:39:11,815 --> 01:39:14,296
At this time tomorrow, he'll
have your job.

1214
01:39:15,997 --> 01:39:17,698
String him up.

1215
01:39:36,269 --> 01:39:37,530
Come on.

1216
01:39:41,992 --> 01:39:43,754
You're not gonna freak out
on me, right?

1217
01:39:43,755 --> 01:39:44,314
I hope not.

1218
01:40:10,409 --> 01:40:11,950
Oh my God.

1219
01:40:13,432 --> 01:40:15,799
He's strung up over the oil tank, they're
gonna light him up, man.

1220
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:16,853
Viking funeral.

1221
01:40:17,313 --> 01:40:20,075
- Public execution.
- Yeah, death by oil.

1222
01:40:26,357 --> 01:40:29,439
Broadcast will commence shortly.
Take final positions.

1223
01:40:30,580 --> 01:40:31,788
Okay, that's good.

1224
01:40:31,789 --> 01:40:34,662
Now give me cameras A through E
and we'll do a full tech rehearsal.

1225
01:40:36,746 --> 01:40:37,832
Is your gun up?

1226
01:40:38,257 --> 01:40:39,751
Yup, what do I do?

1227
01:40:39,752 --> 01:40:42,481
Stay on my six, cover high, and don't
shoot me in the back.

1228
01:40:42,482 --> 01:40:43,854
Six, high, back. Alright.

1229
01:40:54,013 --> 01:40:55,116
You see that? Nailed it.

1230
01:40:55,117 --> 01:40:56,816
Yeah, you really killed
the glass.

1231
01:40:56,817 --> 01:40:57,934
I was aiming for the bulb?

1232
01:40:57,935 --> 01:40:59,397
You can't hit a bulb from
this distance.

1233
01:41:04,099 --> 01:41:06,425
I'm out. Gimme, gimme, you got
an extra magazine?

1234
01:41:06,426 --> 01:41:07,700
They're not universal, Tony.

1235
01:41:08,022 --> 01:41:09,331
I know what I'm doing, I make this stuff.
Gimme another one.

1236
01:41:10,194 --> 01:41:11,785
I don't have one that
fits that gun.

1237
01:41:11,965 --> 01:41:12,488
You've got like five of them.

1238
01:41:12,489 --> 01:41:14,646
Alright, here's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna spot. Ready?

1239
01:41:15,647 --> 01:41:16,892
What'd you see?

1240
01:41:16,893 --> 01:41:19,609
Too fast, nothing.
Here we go.

1241
01:41:23,952 --> 01:41:25,913
Three guys, one girl,
all armed.

1242
01:41:35,867 --> 01:41:37,562
God, I'd kill for some
armor right now.

1243
01:41:37,563 --> 01:41:39,469
- You're right, we need backup.
- Yeah, much.

1244
01:41:40,871 --> 01:41:42,770
You know what?

1245
01:41:46,233 --> 01:41:47,794
- Is that?
- Yep.

1246
01:41:49,276 --> 01:41:50,395
- Are those?
- Yeah.

1247
01:42:07,725 --> 01:42:09,166
Merry Christmas, buddy.

1248
01:42:14,329 --> 01:42:16,712
Jarvis, target Extremis heat
signatures.

1249
01:42:16,713 --> 01:42:18,500
Disable with extreme prejudice.

1250
01:42:18,601 --> 01:42:19,973
Yes, sir.

1251
01:42:24,535 --> 01:42:27,617
What are you waiting for?
It's Christmas.

1252
01:42:29,178 --> 01:42:29,979
Take 'em to church.

1253
01:42:51,592 --> 01:42:53,612
Jarvis, get Igor to steady
this thing.

1254
01:43:05,879 --> 01:43:08,028
This is how you've been managing
your downtime, huh?

1255
01:43:08,029 --> 01:43:09,081
Everybody needs a hobby.

1256
01:43:15,445 --> 01:43:17,486
Heartbreaker? Help Red Snapper
out, will ya?

1257
01:43:45,744 --> 01:43:46,296
Nice timing.

1258
01:43:46,297 --> 01:43:48,504
Oh yeah, that's awesome. Give me
a suit, okay?

1259
01:43:50,667 --> 01:43:52,467
Oh, I'm sorry. They're
only coded to me.

1260
01:43:52,867 --> 01:43:53,654
What's that mean?

1261
01:43:53,655 --> 01:43:54,628
I got you covered.

1262
01:43:58,350 --> 01:44:01,552
- Good evening, Colonel. Can I give you a lift?
- Very funny.

1263
01:44:19,363 --> 01:44:21,645
- Sir, I've located Miss Potts.
- About time.

1264
01:44:34,451 --> 01:44:37,374
Stop, put it down, put it
down, put it down.

1265
01:44:40,014 --> 01:44:42,016
See what happens when you hang out
with my ex-girlfriends?

1266
01:44:44,897 --> 01:44:45,766
You're such a jerk.

1267
01:44:45,767 --> 01:44:47,379
Yup, we'll talk about
it at dinner.

1268
01:44:49,219 --> 01:44:51,941
Come on, a little more,
baby.

1269
01:45:07,791 --> 01:45:09,232
Is this guy bothering you?

1270
01:45:10,792 --> 01:45:13,515
Don't get up!

1271
01:45:16,516 --> 01:45:18,477
Is it hot there?

1272
01:45:19,838 --> 01:45:21,518
Stuck? Feel a little stuck?

1273
01:45:22,519 --> 01:45:25,801
Like a little turtle, cooking in
his little turtle suit?

1274
01:45:26,401 --> 01:45:28,002
Tony

1275
01:45:28,003 --> 01:45:29,644
She's watching.

1276
01:45:30,845 --> 01:45:32,366
I think you should close
your eyes.

1277
01:45:32,367 --> 01:45:33,366
Close your eyes.

1278
01:45:33,966 --> 01:45:36,928
Close your eyes. You don't
want to see this.

1279
01:45:44,373 --> 01:45:45,893
Yeah, you take a minute.

1280
01:46:18,952 --> 01:46:20,634
Jarvis, give me a suit
right now!

1281
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:33,200
Aw, come on!

1282
01:46:34,601 --> 01:46:37,563
Mr. President! Just hold on,
alright? I'm coming.

1283
01:46:38,844 --> 01:46:41,085
Just hold on.
Hold on.

1284
01:47:02,898 --> 01:47:04,358
Buh-bye.

1285
01:47:16,065 --> 01:47:17,827
Brace yourself!

1286
01:47:28,313 --> 01:47:31,995
You look damn good, Mr. President, but
I'm gonna need that suit back.

1287
01:47:45,083 --> 01:47:47,164
The President is secure, Tony.
I'm clearing the area.

1288
01:47:47,165 --> 01:47:48,179
Nice work.

1289
01:47:48,681 --> 01:47:50,525
- Ready sir?
- What do you mean "ready"?

1290
01:47:59,492 --> 01:48:03,732
Pep, I got you. Relax, I got you.
Just look at me.

1291
01:48:05,614 --> 01:48:08,212
Honey, I can't reach any further, and
you can't stay there, alright?

1292
01:48:08,213 --> 01:48:09,237
You gotta let go.

1293
01:48:09,336 --> 01:48:12,139
You gotta let go. I'll catch
you, I promise.

1294
01:48:42,636 --> 01:48:46,519
What a shame, I would
have caught her.

1295
01:49:16,829 --> 01:49:17,930
Eject.

1296
01:50:03,604 --> 01:50:06,045
Well here we are,
on the roof.

1297
01:50:16,411 --> 01:50:18,212
- Mark 42 inbound.
- Well I'll be damned.

1298
01:50:19,012 --> 01:50:20,573
The prodigal son returns.

1299
01:50:36,743 --> 01:50:37,903
Whatever.

1300
01:50:38,904 --> 01:50:40,784
You really didn't deserve
her, Tony.

1301
01:50:42,027 --> 01:50:45,788
It's a pity. I was so close to having
her... perfect.

1302
01:50:48,650 --> 01:50:50,876
Okay, okay, wait, wait, slow down,
slow down.

1303
01:50:51,177 --> 01:50:53,112
You're right. I don't
deserve her.

1304
01:50:54,393 --> 01:50:55,914
But here's where
you're wrong.

1305
01:50:56,634 --> 01:50:58,996
She was already perfect.

1306
01:51:05,559 --> 01:51:09,981
Jarvis, do me a favor and
blow Mark 42.

1307
01:51:10,104 --> 01:51:14,018
NOOOO!!

1308
01:52:25,446 --> 01:52:27,406
No more false faces.

1309
01:52:27,988 --> 01:52:30,387
You said you wanted
the Mandarin.

1310
01:52:30,988 --> 01:52:33,091
You're looking right
at him.

1311
01:52:34,092 --> 01:52:37,530
It was always me, Tony, right
from the start.

1312
01:52:37,731 --> 01:52:39,274
I am the Mandarin!

1313
01:52:50,741 --> 01:52:52,462
I got nothing.

1314
01:52:58,305 --> 01:53:01,467
Jarvis, subject at my 12 o'clock
is not a target, disengage!

1315
01:53:10,032 --> 01:53:12,073
What? Oh what, are
you mad at me?

1316
01:53:37,448 --> 01:53:38,709
Honey.

1317
01:53:43,372 --> 01:53:44,632
Oh my God.

1318
01:53:46,033 --> 01:53:48,515
I was really violent.

1319
01:53:49,275 --> 01:53:51,810
You just scared the devil out of me.
I thought you were

1320
01:53:51,811 --> 01:53:54,218
I was dead. Why? Because I
fell two hundred feet?

1321
01:53:56,980 --> 01:54:00,923
- Who's the hot mess now?
- Still debatable.

1322
01:54:01,983 --> 01:54:03,152
Probably tipping your way
a little bit.

1323
01:54:03,153 --> 01:54:04,264
Why don't you dress like
this at home?

1324
01:54:04,825 --> 01:54:06,825
Hmm? Sports bra, the
whole deal.

1325
01:54:07,166 --> 01:54:10,367
You know I think I understand why you
don't want to give up the suits.

1326
01:54:10,949 --> 01:54:12,909
What I am gonna complain
about now?

1327
01:54:14,269 --> 01:54:17,751
Well, it's me. I'll think
of something.

1328
01:54:19,353 --> 01:54:22,394
- Don't touch me. No, I'm gonna burn you!
- No, no.

1329
01:54:23,536 --> 01:54:25,136
You're not hot.

1330
01:54:26,156 --> 01:54:27,838
Am I gonna be okay?

1331
01:54:27,839 --> 01:54:31,000
No, you're in a relationship with me,
everything will never be okay.

1332
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:33,841
But I think I can figure
this out, yeah.

1333
01:54:33,842 --> 01:54:38,325
I almost had this 20 years ago when I was
drunk. I think I can get you better.

1334
01:54:39,483 --> 01:54:41,085
That's what I do.
I fix things.

1335
01:54:42,326 --> 01:54:44,527
And all your distractions?

1336
01:54:44,928 --> 01:54:47,169
Uh, I'm gonna shave them
down a little bit.

1337
01:54:47,170 --> 01:54:50,716
- Jarvis, hey.
- All wrapped up here, sir.

1338
01:54:50,717 --> 01:54:53,172
Will there be anything else?

1339
01:54:53,173 --> 01:54:54,173
You know what to do.

1340
01:54:54,873 --> 01:54:57,655
The "clean slate" protocol,
sir?

1341
01:54:57,656 --> 01:55:00,957
Screw it, it's Christmas.
Yes, yes.

1342
01:55:37,598 --> 01:55:39,700
Okay so far?
You like it?

1343
01:55:41,200 --> 01:55:43,282
It'll do.

1344
01:55:51,246 --> 01:55:56,169
<i>And so, as Christmas morning began, my
journey had reached its end.</i>

1345
01:56:00,572 --> 01:56:04,854
<i>You start with something pure,
something exciting.</i>

1346
01:56:05,535 --> 01:56:08,296
<i>Then come the mistakes.</i>

1347
01:56:09,057 --> 01:56:10,978
<i>The compromises.</i>

1348
01:56:17,261 --> 01:56:19,623
<i>"We create our own Demons".</i>

1349
01:56:25,187 --> 01:56:27,187
It's great to see you.

1350
01:56:32,037 --> 01:56:34,740
<i>Of course, there are people who
say progress is dangerous.</i>

1351
01:56:35,239 --> 01:56:38,641
<i>But I'll bet none of those idiots ever had to live
with a chest full of shrapnel.</i>

1352
01:56:39,202 --> 01:56:42,104
<i>And now... neither will I.</i>

1353
01:56:43,123 --> 01:56:46,885
<i>Let me tell you, that was the best
sleep I'd had in years.</i>

1354
01:57:07,909 --> 01:57:11,671
- It's okay, it's okay.
- No!

1355
01:58:29,438 --> 01:58:32,960
<i>So if I were to wrap this up tight
with a bow or whatever.</i>

1356
01:58:33,118 --> 01:58:39,543
<i>I guess I'd say my armor was never
a distraction or a hobby.</i>

1357
01:58:40,064 --> 01:58:41,984
<i>It was a cocoon.</i>

1358
01:58:43,005 --> 01:58:48,007
<i>And now, I'm a
changed man.</i>

1359
01:58:57,054 --> 01:58:59,234
<i>You can take away
my house,</i>

1360
01:58:59,634 --> 01:59:01,074
<i>All my tricks and toys.</i>

1361
01:59:01,655 --> 01:59:03,858
<i>One thing you can't take away...</i>

1362
01:59:07,019 --> 01:59:09,121
<i>I am Iron Man.</i>

1363
02:08:50,314 --> 02:08:52,616
You know, and thank you, by
the way, for listening.

1364
02:08:52,617 --> 02:08:55,605
There's just something about getting
it off my chest and putting

1365
02:08:55,606 --> 02:08:58,319
it out there in the atmosphere
instead of holding this in.

1366
02:08:58,649 --> 02:09:01,551
I mean, this is what gets people
sick, you know?

1367
02:09:01,751 --> 02:09:04,653
Wow, I had no idea you were
such a good listener.

1368
02:09:04,753 --> 02:09:08,363
To be able to share all of my intimate
thoughts and my experiences

1369
02:09:08,364 --> 02:09:11,657
with someone, it just cuts the weight
of it in half, you know.

1370
02:09:11,658 --> 02:09:13,012
It's like a snake swallowing
its own tail.

1371
02:09:13,114 --> 02:09:14,058
Everything comes full circle.

1372
02:09:14,558 --> 02:09:17,460
And...and the fact that you've been
able to help me process-

1373
02:09:20,032 --> 02:09:21,432
- So, uh...?
- You with me?

1374
02:09:21,433 --> 02:09:23,634
I was, yeah. Mm-hmm. We were...
uh, we were at, uh...

1375
02:09:23,635 --> 02:09:25,034
You actively napping?

1376
02:09:25,035 --> 02:09:27,436
I...I was...I... I...
I drifted.

1377
02:09:27,736 --> 02:09:29,037
Where did I lose you?

1378
02:09:30,838 --> 02:09:33,139
Elevator in Switzerland.

1379
02:09:33,940 --> 02:09:35,240
So you heard none of it?

1380
02:09:35,741 --> 02:09:38,963
I'm sorry, I'm not that
kind of doctor.

1381
02:09:38,964 --> 02:09:41,644
I'm not a therapist, it's not
my training.

1382
02:09:41,645 --> 02:09:43,045
- So?
- I don't have the...

1383
02:09:43,145 --> 02:09:45,747
- What? The time?
- Temperament.

1384
02:09:45,847 --> 02:09:47,882
You know what? Now that I
think about it,

1385
02:09:47,883 --> 02:09:51,450
Oh God my original wound.
1983, alright?

1386
02:09:51,451 --> 02:09:52,150
Yes.

1387
02:09:52,151 --> 02:09:54,852
I'm 14 years old, I still have a nanny?
That was weird.
