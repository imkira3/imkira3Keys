00:00:17,894 --> 00:00:19,938
[HOST]
Tomorrow marks the one-year anniversary...

3
00:00:20,105 --> 00:00:23,024
since Volee Air Flight 180
exploded and crashed...

4
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:25,735
shortly after take off from JFK Airport.

5
00:00:25,902 --> 00:00:27,696
It's a disaster that's affected many.

6
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:30,407
None more so than
Mount Abraham High School...

7
00:00:30,573 --> 00:00:34,703
which lost 40 students
and four faculty members in the crash.

8
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:36,705
But it was the events after the crash...

9
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:40,291
that has turned this tragic story
into something even stranger.

10
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:44,087
The survivors who managed
to get off the plane before it crashed...

11
00:00:44,254 --> 00:00:48,925
died soon thereafter in a series
of mysterious and bizarre accidents.

12
00:00:49,092 --> 00:00:51,845
Now, to some, these deaths
are just tragic coincidences...

13
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:57,016
but to others, they're an indication that
there are more sinister events taking place.

14
00:00:57,183 --> 00:00:59,144
That's the contention of,
uh, tonight's guest.

15
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,248
- Thank you for joining us this evening.
- [GUEST] Thank you for having me.

16
00:01:02,272 --> 00:01:05,066
Ahem. And I appreciate you using
the word sinister.

17
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:06,818
Most people say supernatural.

18
00:01:06,985 --> 00:01:10,155
They think I'm talking about ghosts
and witches and stuff like that.

19
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:13,116
[HOST] Well, here's your chance
to set the record straight, so...

20
00:01:13,283 --> 00:01:15,910
[GUEST]
Great. Okay, well...

21
00:01:16,327 --> 00:01:19,497
I believe that
there's a sort of force...

22
00:01:19,664 --> 00:01:25,962
uh, an unseen malevolent presence
that's all around us every day.

23
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:29,549
And it determines when we live and die.

24
00:01:29,716 --> 00:01:33,803
And some people call this force the devil.

25
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,723
You know, but I think
that whole religious thing is...

26
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:39,976
So I prefer to call it death itself.

27
00:01:40,143 --> 00:01:42,437
[HOST]
So I'm surrounded by death?

28
00:01:42,604 --> 00:01:44,564
[GUEST]
Absolutely. Absolutely.

29
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:48,443
Every day, everywhere, all the time.

30
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,737
And that's what I want people
to understand...

31
00:01:50,904 --> 00:01:55,074
that death has this grand design
that we all fit into.

32
00:01:55,241 --> 00:02:00,121
So when Alex Browning got off that plane
and took the other survivors with him...

33
00:02:00,288 --> 00:02:02,749
he basically screwed up death's plan.

34
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:05,543
And that's what I'm trying
to warn people about.

35
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:11,174
[HOST] And the fact that all of the
survivors have died is your evidence of this?

36
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:15,470
[GUEST] Well, it's not so much
that the survivors died...

37
00:02:15,637 --> 00:02:18,181
but it's the way that they died.

38
00:02:19,057 --> 00:02:23,895
I mean, there were so many weird, seemingly
random things about the way they died.

39
00:02:24,062 --> 00:02:26,272
It just didn't make sense.

40
00:02:27,816 --> 00:02:30,652
You know, that's the proof
that there's something out there...

41
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:34,155
[HOST] Wait, that's not proof. I mean,
that is your interpretation of events...

42
00:02:34,322 --> 00:02:37,867
that can't be proven
in order to support your ideas.

43
00:02:38,034 --> 00:02:39,953
[MALE VOICE]
Kimberly.

44
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:42,119
[GUEST] Yeah, but you should be
more open-minded...

45
00:02:42,247 --> 00:02:44,374
[HOST] What happened after
that was just coincidence.

46
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:46,125
[GUEST]
May I finish?

47
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,129
A mere coincidence would have
one or two of these kids die.

48
00:02:50,296 --> 00:02:52,340
But not all of them
including their teachers.

49
00:02:52,507 --> 00:02:56,845
[HOST] Yes, but people die all the time,
so why should this be any different?

50
00:02:57,679 --> 00:03:02,851
It forced people to question
these so-called everyday coincidences.

51
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:04,686
What if they were something more?

52
00:03:04,853 --> 00:03:07,164
- What if you could do something about it?
- [HOST] Ha, ha.

53
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:09,315
Please, are you listening to yourself?
This is crazy.

54
00:03:09,482 --> 00:03:13,027
You're saying we should be on guard
every morning when we leave the house?

55
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:15,989
[GUEST]
That's exactly what I'm saying.

56
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:17,740
Exactly it.

57
00:03:18,283 --> 00:03:20,034
And in order to survive...

58
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:24,831
the only way to survive
is to look beneath the visible world.

59
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:28,918
Because in the end,
no one can escape death.

60
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:32,297
