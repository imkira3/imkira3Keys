00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,260
It's a shame you can't see the stars in Aincrad.

4
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,930
But this view isn't so bad.

5
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,810
I've never seen a shooting star.

6
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:03,100
Where I live in the real world,
the night sky's too bright.

7
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,310
Oh yeah? Didn't know you're a city girl.

8
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,190
Come on, Kirito, don't tease me!

9
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:14,450
In my hometown,
there's a pretty famous stargazing spot.

10
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:16,360
There's even a small observatory.

11
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:20,790
Then let's promise to go see a meteor shower there someday!

12
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,410
Sure, someday.

13
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,540
To do that, we have to survive and clear this game.

14
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,250
Yeah.

15
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,170
And then I'll give you a ring
in the real world, too.

16
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,470
<i>On November 6, 2022,

17
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,010
<i>10,000 players of Sword Art Online,

18
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:25,850
<i>a game produced for the NerveGear,
a full-dive virtual reality device,

19
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:31,060
<i>discovered on launch day that,
because of developer Akihiko Kayaba,

20
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,940
<i>it was impossible to log out.

21
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:38,860
<i>They were trapped in a cruel death game,
where "Game Over" meant dying in the real world.

22
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,620
<i>Amid an overwhelming sense of despair,
some took up their swords to clear the game,

23
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,250
<i>while others, succumbing to fear,
cut off all contact.

24
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,710
<i>And there were those who killed other players.

25
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,050
<i>And then, what seemed like an eternity went by.

26
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,720
<i>Until two years later, on November 7, 2024,

27
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,890
<i>thanks to the heroics of one player,

28
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:10,140
<i>the game was finally cleared and everyone was freed.

29
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:16,570
<i>In the end, 4,000 people lost their lives,

30
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,900
<i>and with the death of mastermind Akihiko Kayaba,

31
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,450
<i>the incident drew to a close.

32
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:28,950
<i>The players who returned alive
are known as SAO survivors,

33
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:33,540
<i>and now, they're returning to
their normal lives in the real world.

34
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,050
The Complete SAO Incident Records

35
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,830
Um, excuse me?

36
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:12,830
What are those devices
you have on your ears?

37
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:17,130
<i>The Rumored Gadget?
What is Augmented Reality?

38
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Oh, you mean this?

39
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,120
It's an Augma!

40
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:20,800
<i>Welcome to Augma!

41
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,140
As you can see, its popularity has exploded
immediately upon launch!

42
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:32,020
Let's discuss this next-generation wearable device,
the Augma.

43
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,230
Since the Augma lacks a full-dive function,

44
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:40,320
you might assume it's taken a step back
compared to its predecessor, the Amusphere,

45
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,990
but you'd be mistaken!

46
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:46,620
You could say it's a huge advantage
to be able to use it while conscious.

47
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,910
The Amusphere, which enables you
to full dive into the virtual world,

48
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,080
and AR, or rather, the Augma,
which augments reality,

49
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,000
should be considered to be
two totally different things.

50
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,210
You're absolutely right.

51
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:02,920
Most importantly, the Augma doesn't possess
the inherent risks of a full-dive machine.

52
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,930
In fact, there's been a surge in users
who wear it for fitness and health monitoring.

53
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,930
And one such example
is the latest game, Ordinal Scale.

54
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,770
Make Every Day an Adventure!

55
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:19,520
Ordinal Scale's defining feature is its ranking system.

56
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,190
Every player is given a number
that reflects their rank,

57
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,320
and as they play the game,
their rank increases.

58
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:31,370
When this number reaches the upper tiers,
you can receive various services

59
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,790
from participating companies
in the real world.

60
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,620
Now this is amazing.

61
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:40,880
There are discounts from a major online retailers
and access to premiere tickets.

62
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,590
There are exclusive shopping sites,

63
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:46,260
and even a coupon
for a free extra-large beef bowl.

64
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,760
Pretty tantalizing for young users!

65
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:52,470
Who knows what amazing benefit you'll get
if you reach No. 1?

66
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:58,730
The drones, launched right after the start
of the service to relieve the strain on the network,

67
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,690
now seem to be part of a new landscape.

68
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,490
And contributing to the game's growing popularity,
is its image character, Yuna.

69
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:12,490
Debuting as the world's first AR idol,
Yuna is an AI controlled by a program,

70
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,250
but as her speech and expressions
are so astonishingly natural,

71
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:18,750
there are constant rumors
that a real human is actually playing her.

72
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,090
Well, that mysterious aspect
might just be one reason for her popularity.

73
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,460
Actually, I'm Yuna's--

74
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:28,470
Uh, word is she'll be performing
her first live concert at the end of this month,

75
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:32,180
but the 30,000 tickets for the event
sold out instantly.

76
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,930
I finally managed to get some
after going through various routes--

77
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:40,480
The momentum of the Augma and Ordinal Scale
is only going to accelerate!

78
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,110
@ New National Stadium Arena
See you all there!

79
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,500
All right! We cleared it!

80
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,210
You did it, Silica! Nice assist, Liz!

81
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,380
That got us 100 points!

82
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,960
It says we get free cake! Lucky us!

83
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,760
Don't you think youâ€™re playing games
a little too much?

84
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,680
I-I never thought
you'd be the one telling us that, Kirito!

85
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,220
Well, you can get points from all kinds of shops.
So we might as well play, right?

86
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,390
Can't you just admit
you wanted to play with us?

87
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,230
Anyway, it's really convenient, isn't it?

88
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:26,190
We can watch TV anywhere we go,
it's easier to navigate than a smartphone,

89
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,650
the weather report's a total lifesaver,
and best of all, we can talk with Yui!

90
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,570
YES!

91
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,530
It seems like youâ€™re really into it, Liz.

92
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,830
Well, I wouldn't say that.

93
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:41,290
But hey, since they handed them out
to all students at the survivors' school,

94
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,290
we can at least try it out
for a bit, you know?

95
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,540
Thank you for waiting!

96
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,590
This is the clear bonus set.

97
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,970
I want this one!

98
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,220
The AI even knows what we'd like, huh?

99
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,480
What was it called, "Deep Learning"?

100
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,110
That's what you call thoughtful.
Unlike someone else we know...

101
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,190
I hear that the AI also collects data
on what you eat.

102
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,200
This may be bad.
You're consuming
too many calories!

103
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,450
Liz! What's the matter?

104
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,550
How much more until the goal point?

105
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,420
About halfway.

106
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,130
It's tough for princesses,
not being able to have a part-time job.

107
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,640
No! It's not like that!

108
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,260
It's exciting to get a present
for Kirito, isn't it?

109
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,800
Yep. I'll do my best!

110
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,180
Asuna?

111
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:47,980
Who knew they'd give the entire survivors' school
free tickets to Yuna's first live concert?

112
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,820
How is attending a concert a class?

113
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,610
I know! That school is pretty strange, isn't it?

114
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,160
Well, lucky you, since youâ€™re a huge Yuna fan!

115
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,450
H-Hey, I'm not that big of a fan!

116
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,870
But you were belting out Yuna songs
with Suguha the other day at karaoke!

117
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,500
Go on! You should let everyone else hear, too!

118
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,830
You were so good!

119
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,800
Hey, Kirito, youâ€™re going
to Yuna's concert, too, right?

120
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:59,760
I'm not sure. I'm not much of a fan.

121
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,560
We should all go together!

122
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,020
Well, if I feel up for it.

123
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:11,440
I have to admit,
this thing seems like a neat gadget.

124
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,320
But I still like full-dive better.

125
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,650
Is that so?

126
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:19,490
Well, after being totally immersed
in another world for three years, yeah.

127
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:26,080
Don't tell me you want to go back.

128
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:31,710
That reminds me! Speaking of Aincrad,
I wonder if those rumors are true?

129
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,170
You know, that boss monsters from the old SAO
are showing up in Ordinal Scale?

130
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,420
Oh, right.

131
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,590
You mean those mysterious event battles.

132
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,180
Are they some kind of promotion?

133
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:47,430
I don't know, but since they keep
the locations secret till the last minute,

134
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,850
it's hard to get there in time
without a ride.

135
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,480
I wonder what's really going on?

136
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,320
So all we need is a way to get there, right?

137
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,450
Klein:
Let's do an OS boss raid together!

138
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,280
Kirito!

139
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,970
Looks like we made it just in time.

140
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:29,810
The location was just announced a half hour ago,
but there's already a pretty big crowd here.

141
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:33,230
I guess there's that many more players now.

142
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,320
What took you so long, Kirito?

143
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,820
Oh, Asuna's here, too!

144
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,910
Since Kirito wasn't that into it,
I had to drag him along.

145
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,820
Also, I won rock-paper-scissors!

146
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,910
Okay then.

147
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,160
All right!
Let's show Asuna what we're made of!

148
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:55,090
- Kirito, it's almost time.
- O-Okay.

149
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,760
- Ordinal Scale, activate!
- Ordinal Scale, activate!

150
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,470
That's...

151
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:48,220
The boss monster from floor 10 in Aincrad,
Kagachi the Samurai Lord!

152
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,060
He looks exactly like the SAO boss!

153
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,480
We can't use our sword skills now.

154
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,230
But if his attack patterns
are the same as before...

155
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,530
Y-Yuna?

156
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,490
Are you guys ready?

157
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:12,000
All right, let the battle begin!
Music, start!

158
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,420
All right! Yuna's started singing!
It's a special stage with a bonus!

159
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,110
I'm gonna piss myself!

160
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,360
Is this a death game?

161
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:46,950
That thing is huge!

162
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,950
What do you say, Kirito?

163
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,370
Wait! Time out! Time out!

164
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,600
Crap!

165
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,230
Hey! At zero HP, there's a penalty!

166
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,690
I know that!

167
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,440
Guns didn't work after all.

168
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,150
But I'd be scared to fight in close combat.

169
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,740
All right!

170
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:35,250
The bonus is ours!

171
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,670
I got it!

172
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,210
Nice block!

173
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,670
Tank!

174
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,050
I'll deflect it!

175
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:11,450
Good. Eight of them, huh?

176
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,250
My body feels heavy.
This is definitely different from the virtual world.

177
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,920
It's targeting you!

178
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,340
Kirito!

179
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,380
Ouch!

180
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,140
No joke, it's so hard to move!

181
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,890
That's cause youâ€™re out of shape!

182
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,770
I'm just getting started!

183
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,070
What is he doing?

184
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,650
The last attack is mine!

185
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,070
Crap!

186
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,890
Wow!

187
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,390
Rank 2?

188
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:25,770
Here comes his ultimate move!
Tanks, follow me!

189
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,450
Hey, not bad! All right!

190
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,450
Okay! Me, too!

191
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,730
Retreat for now!

192
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:13,860
All right!

193
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,660
Switch.

194
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,580
Get him!

195
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:43,350
That was awesome!

196
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:46,440
Congratulations on defeating the boss monster!

197
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,940
I just boosted your points big time!

198
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,030
Now I'm going to reward the player
who did the most tonight!

199
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,320
All right!

200
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:05,790
You're today's MVP! Congratulations!

201
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,210
All right. See you later!

202
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,220
Good job, Asuna.

203
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:25,520
The No. 2 ranked player, huh?
There's some amazing people out there.

204
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:32,020
My ranking shot up
just from this one boss battle. Look!

205
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,490
- Gotta hand it to those SAO bosses!
- Man, it'll be chaotic if all the users find out!

206
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,080
Huh? Looks like you barely moved up at all.

207
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,830
Be quiet. I'll leave these raids to you.

208
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,210
- Make sure Asuna gets home okay.
- I know that!

209
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:56,170
If he takes you somewhere strange,
give me a call. I'll come rescue you.

210
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,420
Okay!

211
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,690
An item in a place like this!

212
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,610
You're that guy from the event.

213
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:24,410
What, are you hunting items?

214
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:28,500
Donâ€™t get cocky 'cause you're No. 2.
It won't go as easy as you think.

215
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,470
Friday, April 24, 2026
- Inside ALO, New Aincrad, Floor 22 -

216
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:45,220
Man, the floor boss's attack patterns in AR
may have been the same as the original,

217
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:48,930
but fighting with our real bodies
made me sore all over!

218
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,560
I'm surprised such a small party beat it.

219
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,230
Well, Asuna and I already fought it once before.

220
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,280
But the other players
were inexperienced in group battles,

221
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,820
so it was an uphill battle.

222
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,490
And you were totally wiped out, too, Kirito!

223
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,780
I wasn't used to AR battles, that's all.

224
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,960
Oh, but that Yuna girl showed up to cheer us on,
and at the very end, as a reward--

225
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,750
Big Brother, you mean
you fought a boss battle with Yuna?

226
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,130
Is that true?

227
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,420
- Big Brother!
- Kirito!

228
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,590
I'm just glad I got to see her sing live.

229
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,840
I forgot to put my name down
for one of Yuna's concert tickets.

230
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:30,640
That's right, I scored a pair of tickets
during the Ordinal Scale registration campaign.

231
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,310
I did, too.

232
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,980
- What? Lucky you!
- What? Lucky you!

233
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:40,110
All right! I'll give you one of mine!

234
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,030
- Stare.
- And I'll give one to you, Leafa.

235
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:44,990
- Yay!
- Yay!

236
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,580
Oh, but I actually have
kendo boot camp next week.

237
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,710
Still, I wonder what's going on.

238
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:01,510
The bosses from the old SAO showing up
in Ordinal Scale event battles?

239
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,630
There hasn't been a tie-in campaign, right?

240
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:11,020
No. And even if they wanted to do a tie-in,
Argus, the company that ran SAO, is gone.

241
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:15,850
Were the other players in the event
aware it was an SAO boss?

242
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,480
It didn't seem like they were.

243
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:22,610
I think only we were familiar
with that boss's attack patterns.

244
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,780
<i>Switch.

245
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,200
What do you think, Kirito?

246
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,040
Yeah. It's probably like you said.

247
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:37,880
But if the old SAO bosses keep showing up,
more players are sure to catch on.

248
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,250
After all, you get a lot of points.

249
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,680
You mean they're trying to reproduce Aincrad
in the real world?

250
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,680
But your life isn't at risk
like with the NerveGear, is it?

251
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,850
You're overthinking it.

252
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,680
Anyway, Yui, let me know
if you find out anything.

253
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,730
Okay, Daddy!

254
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:57,900
If I can fight by Yuna's side,
I want to join the events, too!

255
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,270
Hey, me too!

256
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,900
Next time I'm gonna ride double
with Kirito for sure...

257
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:06,200
I wish they'd schedule these events
when it'd be easier for us to join in.

258
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:10,870
For you ladies in such a plight,
us guys in Furinkazan will happily drive you.

259
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,620
We'll pick you up!

260
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,700
That would worry me more!

261
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,750
Hey, now.

262
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,170
Yuna...

263
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,050
What's the matter, Yuna?

264
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:24,460
What is this thing?

265
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,550
It's proof that your singing thrilled everybody.

266
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,340
Oh, is that so?

267
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:33,310
And we'll get even more soon...

268
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,060
by getting revenge on every one of them.

Okay. See you later.

272
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,240
You're still in that outfit?

273
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:56,580
Yeah, well. I've got some research to do
on my plans for after graduation.

274
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,120
It's good that youâ€™re researching colleges,

275
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,960
but why don't you swing a shinai
or exercise once in a while?

276
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,250
Yeah, yeah. If I ever feel like it, I will.

277
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,670
- Donâ€™t forget my souvenir.
- Seriously!

278
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,970
You know, you should use this more often.

279
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,630
They even offer gym coupons!

280
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,930
See ya!

Link start!

284
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:02,190
Hey, Asuna. You're here.

285
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,060
Hi, Kirito.

286
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,440
Where's Leafa?

287
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,690
Oh, Sugu just left for her boot camp.

288
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,360
It's going to be lonely.

289
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:14,530
True. It's gonna be tough
without her waking me up in the morning.

290
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,620
Really...

291
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,410
Make sure you eat something, okay?

292
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,420
Sure. I can cook for myself, you know.

293
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,210
I worry about you.

294
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:27,420
Once youâ€™re focused on something,
you forget to eat, you know?

295
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,920
Daddy's go-to meal is
plain pepperoncino pasta, after all.

296
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:33,260
No need for that much detail.

297
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,390
Kirito, about what we discussed the other day,

298
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,350
my mother says she'd like to meet you.

299
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,190
Well, one of these days.

300
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,270
Right.

301
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:55,950
The next ALO event quest has been postponed.

302
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,280
I see.

303
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:02,580
In the last two weeks,
there's been a 30% drop in logins, Mommy.

304
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,380
I guess everybody's busy with Ordinal Scale.

305
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,090
You may be right.
But I'm sure they'll come back eventually.

306
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,760
Yeah.

00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,640
Hey! Asuna!

312
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:05,730
Over here!

313
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:10,770
Sorry to drag you out here.
You weren't asleep, were you?

314
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,280
No, I was just taking a bath
and rushed right over.

315
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,990
Huh? You're not all here yet?

316
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:22,290
We can't get ahold of one of our members.

317
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,710
We'll jump in once we're all here,
so go on ahead.

318
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:26,620
All right.

319
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:30,590
If youâ€™re late, then I'm going to
earn all of your points, okay?

320
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,420
That's cold, Asuna!

321
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:04,790
Are you guys ready?

322
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,250
All right, let the battle begin!
Music, start!

323
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:20,550
Holy crap! Yuna showed up!

324
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,010
We gotta get going!

325
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:25,310
Damn, he's not answering my texts.

326
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:30,100
- We'd better go or today's prey will--
- No. Today's prey is you!

327
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,610
Why is it here?

328
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:46,040
Oh, a new song! How lucky!

329
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,920
As expected.

330
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:01,550
I can see why they were
one of the Assault Teams.

331
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:10,480
But...

332
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:15,310
I'm going to show you
the difference between AR and VR!

333
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,360
All right!

334
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,860
Score! The bonus is ours!

335
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,450
There's no pain like this in VR, right?

336
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,670
You bastard! What the hell are you doing?

337
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:43,510
Hey, now. What a buzzkill.

338
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:46,850
Damn you!

339
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:52,520
Hey, let's have some fun.

340
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,960
Here. You forgot something.

341
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:21,880
Keep your eyes open.

342
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,140
That motion...

343
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:14,020
A wide-range attack is coming!
Tanks, draw its attention!

344
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,020
R-Right!

345
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:20,360
It'll use its ultimate move soon,
so aim for its wings when it hovers!

346
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,730
Uh, right!

347
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:24,360
Let's finish it off once it's shot down!

348
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,110
Gotcha!

349
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:33,490
Fire!

350
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,960
- Now's our chance!
- Right!

351
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,510
Oh, no!

352
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,320
Hey, youâ€™re amazing.

353
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:12,910
Nice direction!

354
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:15,200
Do you have experience from other games?

355
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,500
W-Well... Th-Thanks!

356
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,790
So it's you again!

357
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,250
Congrats!

358
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,040
Oh, what a pity.

359
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:26,510
Well...

360
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,510
See you later, Asuna.

361
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,680
Lightning Flash Asuna...

362
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:40,020
Ordinal Scale is a truly realistic MMO game
where players are free from the fear of death.

363
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:44,190
And that's where I'll demonstrate my true power.

364
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:09,590
And now here's the latest on Ordinal Scale,
the AR game everyone's talking about.

365
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:15,890
We hear that bosses from Sword Art online's
Old Aincrad have appeared in its event battles.

366
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:20,310
Apparently, you can haul in a ton of points
in the boss raids.

367
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:24,610
Not only that, but the odds there'll be
a live performance by Yuna are extremely high!

368
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,820
What I wouldn't give to rank up
and earn enough to cover my internet fees!

369
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,320
Now, now.

370
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:34,530
Also, due to "The Complete SAO Incident Records"
being published last month,

371
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:40,160
it seems there's been a surge in those wanting
to relive Sword Art Online, now shut down.

372
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:44,380
So people are jumping on the bandwagon
after the fact, huh?

373
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:48,050
That's why, along with the increase
in Augma users,

374
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:53,720
there's been a downturn in logins
for mainstream VR games like ALO and GGO.

375
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:56,720
Is everyone bored of VR?

376
00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:03,440
I couldn't say for sure, but we have
some of the show's past guests live right now.

377
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,440
Here you go!

378
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:11,530
In the next ALO duel tournament,
I'd like to face players who pose to threat to me.

379
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:14,030
Salamander Race - Eugene

380
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:14,030
But they may as well declare me the winner.

381
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:16,370
"Cait Sith Leader - Alicia Rue"

382
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:16,370
You didn't win last time, did you now?

383
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:21,370
"Sleeping Knights" Guild Member - Siune

384
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:21,370
We're extremely attached to this place,
so we have no plans to uproot ourselves.

385
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:25,370
Lately, the number of players
in Sylph territory has been plunging.

386
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:33,760
Sylph Leader - Sakuya

387
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:28,700
I's a shame, 'as we're no longer able
to hold major events.

388
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,650
But I'm no worried about a thing.

389
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,760
I'm sure everyone will be back someday.

390
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:36,550
Fukajiro, where have you gone?

391
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,970
I mean, I even got my hands
on a new grenade launcher just for you!

392
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,730
- L-Leafa!
- Come back!

393
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:45,730
We apologize for the unseemly images.

394
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:50,320
<i>Uh, and last but not least,
a really big guest is unexpectedly here!

395
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,150
<i>Enjoy!

396
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,280
<i>Goad evening, everybody!

397
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:57,660
<i>Only four more days till my first live arena show!

398
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,990
<i>I hope you're all looking forward to it!

399
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,530
Good morning, Daddy!

400
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,950
Morning, Yui.

401
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:43,740
Where are we?

402
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:47,540
Oh, this is where Asuna participated
in that event battle yesterday.

403
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:50,250
It seems like Mommy's really giving it her all.

404
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,540
Looks like it.

405
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,460
Daddy, what's this mark?

406
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:01,050
Yeah, that's the day Asuna and I are going to see
a meteor shower at Mt. Doudaira.

407
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:04,470
That sounds lovely! I want to see it, too!

408
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,020
Of course youâ€™re coming with us.

409
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:09,020
Yay! I wonder what should I wear?

410
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:12,940
We promised each other in SAO.
That's where Asuna and I--

411
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,070
Hey, I know, Daddy!

412
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:17,690
Why donâ€™t you train to fight
in Ordinal Scale right now?

413
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,320
Mommy was worried about you
not getting enough exercise.

414
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:24,450
You'd better show her how cool you can be,
or your marriage will be in danger!

415
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,040
Ordinal Scale, activate.

416
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:39,510
There's just something off about this.
The lag is huge, or rather...

417
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:42,640
It's a different physical sensation
than virtual reality!

418
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,010
Your only option is to practice, Daddy!

419
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,560
Yui, you know what--

420
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:54,980
I'm sorry!

421
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:05,280
Who are you?

422
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:25,300
Yui, did you see that?

423
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,140
Yes.

424
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,390
She didn't have an NPC tag, but...

425
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,480
She didn't seem to be a player, either.

426
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,900
So that means... Is she an AR ghost?

427
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,320
No, that would be unscientific.

428
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,110
It would, right?

429
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:42,150
It looked like she was saying something.

430
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:47,330
Judging by how her lips moved,
it seems like she was saying, "Search."

431
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,960
Kirito! Thanks for waiting!

432
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:59,380
Sorry I went to the event on my own.

433
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,760
You donâ€™t have to worry about me.

434
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:07,180
By the way, you said you'd spotted some other
SAD survivors besides us in that UDX battle?

435
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,930
Yes. That No. <i>2 player.

436
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,020
Oh, that guy?

437
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:15,400
I think he was a member
of the Knights of the Blood Oath. Probably.

438
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,190
Probably?

439
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,980
The thing is,
he's totally different than he was in SAO.

440
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:24,950
Back then, he went by the name Nautilus,
and he was diligent and had potential,

441
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,950
but he couldn't overcome his fear of death,
so he didn't take part in a single boss raid.

442
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,870
So his playing style totally changed, huh?

443
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:36,380
I can't believe how he moved so nimbly
in an AR game.

444
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,750
You'd think he was a gymnast.

445
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,130
You didn't talk to him?

446
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:45,010
No. Since I wasn't sure
if he'd be glad to see me in real life.

447
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:49,050
But since he was a fellow guild member,
I am a little concerned.

448
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,890
That's our former vice commander, huh?

449
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:53,270
Come on!

450
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:57,980
Hey, Asuna.

451
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,150
You've never heard any talk about ghosts
appearing in this park, have you?

452
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,650
Come on! Cut it out, will you?

453
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,530
You know I donâ€™t like ghost stories!

454
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:09,740
Oh, yeah. That's right.

455
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:16,580
By the way, Kirito,
about that promise we made...

456
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:17,710
Y-Yeah ?

457
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:21,590
My mom started grilling me
about who I was going with.

458
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:23,460
You mean...

459
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:26,340
But it's all right.

460
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:28,220
We need to get ready, donâ€™t we?

461
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,050
Yeah. You're right.

462
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,260
Daddy, Mommy?

463
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,600
I was able to find out one thing!

464
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,020
Everybody, please look at this.

465
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:40,900
So far, the boss monsters
have appeared every night at 9:00 PM.

466
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:46,280
This is where Daddy and Mommy fought
Kagachi the Samurai Lord two days ago.

467
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:51,030
And this is where Mommy battled last night.

468
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,580
Let me plot the locations
where the other nine monsters showed up.

469
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,460
And now I'm overlaying
a map of Old Aincrad on it.

470
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:00,750
This is...

471
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:06,130
The places where the boss monsters appeared
overlap with the dungeon in Old Aincrad!

472
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,890
To be precise, these are
the closest parks and plazas

473
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:12,430
to the coordinates that overlap
with the dungeon.

474
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:14,560
Therefore, we can make certain predictions.

475
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:20,230
I can anticipate that tonight at nine,
one will appear in Yebisu Garden Place in Shibuya!

476
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:24,980
If we know in advance where it's going to be,
I can join, too!

477
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:27,240
It's at night, so will that be okay?

478
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,990
As long as I'm with you guys, I'll be fine!

479
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:33,120
Funny, our parents would complain
if this was VR.

480
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,490
Well, yeah.

481
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:39,330
I'll be at work then, so I can't go.

482
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,920
Huh? Kirito, youâ€™re not going?

483
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,750
Nah, I'm going to pass on this one.

484
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:47,670
What? Are you that bad at AR battles?

485
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,920
A bit.

486
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,930
Guess it can't be helped, then.

487
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,340
Bike...

488
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:58,520
All right, let's show Yuna our veteran party play!

489
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,100
- Right!
- Right!

490
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:02,270
By the way, where's Klein?

491
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,070
Who knows? Probably immersing himself
in Ordinal Scale somewhere?

492
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,360
Oh yeah,
I did see him before the battle yesterday,

493
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:13,120
but Klein never did join the event.

494
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,030
He said they were waiting on
one Furinkazan member.

495
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,420
With AR battles, it's a pain to have to
physically go to the actual venue, huh?

496
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:27,050
Speaking of which, we should pick a time to meet
when we go see the meteor shower, right?

497
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:33,550
Whatever. Let's discuss our plans for tonight.

498
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,810
First, let's decide where to meet up.

499
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:38,680
- Yui?
- Yes, Daddy?

500
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:42,020
About going to see the stars...
we're keeping it a secret from the others.

501
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,480
I'm so sorry!

502
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:45,810
Well, anyway,

503
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:50,900
could you send the bosses' location data
to my cell later?

504
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,860
Yes, I'll be sure to do that!

505
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:06,170
Klein

506
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:14,010
To: Agil
Subject: Do you have a second?
I can't reach Klein.
Know anything?
Kazuto

507
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,640
<i>Hello? Kirito?

508
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,270
Hey, Asuna.

509
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:23,520
Hang on a sec.

510
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,520
<i>It really is just pasta.

511
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,360
For today, yeah.

512
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:32,900
That's all my cooking app ever recommends.

513
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:36,110
<i>Seriously. Your diet's going to be so unbalanced.

514
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:42,410
Then make me a ragout rabbit stew
again sometime, okay?

515
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:45,580
<i>That's not going to be easy. Oh, I know!

516
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,170
<i>I can make something similar,
so I'll get the ingredients!

517
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:50,630
S-Sure. I can't wait.

518
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:53,380
<i>Hey, Kirito.

519
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,260
<i>About that ghost you mentioned this afternoon.

520
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:59,930
<i>You asked me if I'd heard
of any stories like that in Yoyogi Park.

521
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:01,140
O-Oh, right.

522
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,100
<i>I did some digging afterwards.

523
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,230
<i>This didn't happen in Yoyogi Park,

524
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:10,020
<i>but lately there are rumors among the players
about the ghost of a girl wearing a hoodie.

525
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,230
I..Is that right?

526
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,240
<i>Wait, did you see her, too?

527
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,400
Of course not!

528
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:19,870
And I'm sure the people who said they saw her
must've mistaken an NPC for her.

529
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:21,870
<i>You really think so?

530
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:26,080
Oh, hey!
The tent and sleeping bags I have look useable.

531
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,580
<i>Thanks!

532
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,380
<i>Thank goodness you had some outdoor gear
at your place!

533
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,420
<i>Tell your father thank you for me!

534
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,800
Yeah, sure.

535
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:36,510
<i>I can't wait to see the meteor shower!

536
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:42,810
Klein. Leader of the Furinkazan guild, huh?

537
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:48,310
We got a lot of them yesterday, huh?

538
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,520
I suppose so.

539
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:52,570
But the main dish is still yet to come.

540
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:53,820
<i>Ream?

541
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,450
Does this interest you, Yuna?

542
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:01,910
Nothing but text. Is it a difficult book?

543
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:04,620
No. It's like a journal of my memories.

544
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:10,790
"If he draws his second sword,
no one will remain standing." it says.

545
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,130
What is this? It's so cool! Read it to me, Eiji!

546
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:19,180
The Black Swordsman
"If he draws his second sword,
no one will remain standing."

547
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:51,830
YOU WIN!
YOU GET A FREE DRINK COUPON!!

548
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,900
So we meet at last, huh?

549
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,480
Have you been looking for me?

550
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,650
You donâ€™t seem to be a ghost.

551
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,530
Who are you, anyway?

552
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:27,080
Is there something you want me to search for?

553
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,000
Hey!

554
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:39,260
Hello?

555
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:41,760
<i>You finally picked up!

556
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,640
Oh, my bad. I was driving. What's up?

557
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,390
<i>It's Klein.

558
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:49,390
<i>He's been in a hospital in Yoyogi
since last night.

559
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:51,430
<i>Apparently his arm was broken.

560
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,060
What? Was he in an accident or something?

561
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:56,610
<i>I don't have all the details,

562
00:44:56,690 --> 00:45:01,070
<i>but he said he ran into some trouble
on his way to an Ordinal Scale battle.

563
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:04,410
I see. Let me know when you find out more.

564
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:07,490
<i>Right. Be careful on that bike of yours, too.

565
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:08,990
Agil

566
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:12,290
Daddy...

567
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,250
To: Seijirou Kikuoka
Subject: It's Kirigaya. I have something to ask of you.
There's something bugging me
about the recent OS event battles.
I'm calling in the favors you owe me.

568
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:25,550
Do you think Yuna will show up again today?

569
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:29,850
What do you think of Yuna, Silica?

570
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:35,350
Is she a program like they announced,
or is she actually a real human?

571
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:39,610
I don't think she's real.

572
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:42,190
But she doesnâ€™t seem like just an AI either.

573
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:47,490
I agree! That crystal-clear singing voice
isn't something a real human can produce--

574
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:50,620
Yeah, my voice isn't crystal-clear at all, is it now?

575
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:53,120
I didn't go that far!

576
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:56,040
I'm never going to karaoke with you again!

577
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:59,210
Sorry! Please forgive me!

578
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:00,630
It's almost time!

579
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,650
Are you guys ready?

580
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:24,820
All right, let the battle begin!
Music, start!

581
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:26,070
Yuna!

582
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:30,950
We lucked out!

583
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:33,870
All right, wanna go out there
and grab some points?

584
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:35,210
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

585
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:41,420
Just because there aren't any tanks!

586
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,380
Just as we planned!

587
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,680
This is a tough position to be in!

588
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,260
You three are kicking butt
even though youâ€™re all girls!

589
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:58,350
We're not gonna let you outdo us!

590
00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:01,270
All right! Bring it on!

591
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:08,780
Ordinal Scale, activate!

592
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,080
Daddy?

593
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:16,080
That girl... she looks like someone.

594
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:20,960
You were in KoB.

595
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:23,590
You're Nautilus from
the Knights of the Blood Oath, right?

596
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:27,300
Please donâ€™t call me by that name, Asuna.

597
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:30,550
Eiji?

598
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,980
You've spent a lot of time in this game, I see.

599
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:38,690
I'm not who I was before.

600
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:42,150
You seem to be a lot more mellow now yourself.

601
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,150
You really think so?

602
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,940
Yes. Back then, you were much...

603
00:47:58,910 --> 00:47:59,660
That girl...

604
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:01,210
Here goes!

605
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:05,750
It's about time.

606
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:27,280
Surround it!
We're all gonna attack at once!

607
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:30,820
What?

608
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:33,360
Something else is going to show up?

609
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:38,950
Pina!

610
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,040
Oh, is that all?

611
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:43,880
Pina, did you come to help us?

612
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:59,310
Silica! This way!

613
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:07,860
Daddy! That's the monster
called Dorcel the Chaos Drake,

614
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:10,320
who would've been the floor 91 boss!

615
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:11,820
Floor 91?

616
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,450
Dammit!

617
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,910
No!

618
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:21,580
Why are you going after me?

619
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:23,790
I'm sorry--

620
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:26,750
Silica!

621
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:29,550
Silica!

622
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:01,660
Asuna! Stay with me, Asuna!

623
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:05,960
Asuna!

624
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:08,750
Are you all right?

625
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,260
You bastard!

626
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:20,300
What the hell did you do?

627
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:28,560
How pitiful.

628
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:33,110
So that's all VR's greatest swordsman
amounts to in AR?

629
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,360
What did you say?

630
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:39,320
Hey, you!

631
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:41,490
Donâ€™t forget game etiquette!

632
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:56,220
Too bad!

633
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,850
Good job!

634
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:07,690
Hey! What about the bonus?

635
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:13,070
- Hey! I thought you were going to help Asuna!
- Bonus! Please kiss me!

636
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:21,030
Asuna! Are you okay?

637
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:28,580
That's too bad.
We'll have to wait for next time.

638
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:36,710
I-I'm sorry, Asuna.
It was all because I messed up.

639
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:41,340
You got shoved to the ground by that No. <i>2 guy!
What's his problem?

640
00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:46,970
Yeah, but as expected of you,
vice commander of the Knights of the Blood Oath.

641
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:50,730
Wh-What's wrong, Asuna?

642
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:52,980
No! It's nothing!

643
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:54,860
Come on, let's go home.

644
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:56,440
- Okay.
- Will you be okay?

645
00:51:56,730 --> 00:51:58,570
Here, grab onto me.

646
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:03,370
All right, see you. Good job tonight.

647
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,240
Kirito?

648
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:06,700
What's up?

649
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:12,130
Um... do you remember
the day that you and I first met?

650
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:17,170
Sure I do. It was at that boss raid meeting
on Aincrad's first floor.

651
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:22,550
It was, wasn't it?
You asked me to join your party, didn't you?

652
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:26,390
Looking back now, I can't believe
I was able to do something like that.

653
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:56,540
I can already see the lake from here.

654
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:58,300
I can't...

655
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:07,220
Kirito! Donâ€™t go off on your own!

656
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:09,310
Kirito?

657
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,130
Kirito!

658
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:42,010
Who are you?

659
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:44,180
I'm...

660
00:53:57,690 --> 00:53:58,520
A dream?

661
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:01,480
Kirito?

662
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,330
Kirito...

663
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,460
No way... Why?

664
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:31,180
Hello?

665
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:38,100
What's wrong? It's late.

666
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:41,770
You didn't even turn on the lights.

667
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:47,150
Sorry, Kirito, for calling you here
all of a sudden.

668
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,830
It's okay. Anyway, did something happen?

669
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:02,420
About how long have we lived here, again?

670
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:07,680
If you mean since we first bought it in SAO,
it's been two and a half years.

671
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,680
It has, hasn't it?

672
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:10,970
Asuna?

673
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,680
Just as I thought, I can't remember.

674
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,940
What can't you remember?

675
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:21,980
I can't remember anything
that happened in Aincrad.

676
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:27,070
How you and I met, how we fought together,
and when we lived together in this house...

677
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:29,740
Wh-What are you talking about, Asuna?

678
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:31,030
You're kidding, aren't you?

679
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:37,330
As more time went by,
my memories of SAO kept fading.

680
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:39,500
And now there's nothing left.

681
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:50,260
Yokohama North General Hospital

682
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:02,770
I'll have to go through the data
before I'll know any details,

683
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:08,070
but Asuna's brain shows signs of having had
its memory scanned in specific areas.

684
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:10,240
Memory scanning in specific areas?

685
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:13,570
Do you mean that
it only read her memories of SAO?

686
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:15,030
But how is that possible?

687
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,910
One possibility that comes to mind,

688
00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:20,920
is that as she's reliving memories
of her time in SAO,

689
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,420
the single neurons serving as
the key to those memories were identified,

690
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:29,970
and then the images could've been
forcibly scanned with focused electron pulses.

691
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:34,680
In the last few days, there have been
multiple reports of similar cases in the city.

692
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:38,970
It could be a coincidence,
but what the patients have in common

693
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:42,940
is the fact that they've taken part
in that AR game's event battles.

694
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:45,650
So are you saying that the Augma is the cause?

695
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:47,730
I can't be certain of that yet.

696
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:50,820
Is Asuna going to be all right?

697
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:55,620
At this time, there are no signs
of any organic anomalies in the brain itself.

698
00:56:55,700 --> 00:57:02,040
Most likely, her ability to recall was impaired
when the electron pulses degenerated her spine.

699
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:20,000
https://t.me/RickyChannel

700
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:08,380
That said, I can't say without further observation
whether her symptoms will worsen.

701
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:13,930
In other words, she might lose even more
of her memory than she already has?

702
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,770
I'm sorry, Kirito.

703
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:33,030
Don't worry about it.
You still remember recent events, after all.

704
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:39,030
You've just temporarily forgotten
what happened in SAO.

705
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:40,950
It'll come back to you in no time.

706
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:50,380
Asuna?

707
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,300
What's wrong, Asuna?

708
00:57:57,850 --> 00:57:58,720
Asuna!

709
00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:37,970
Well?

710
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:46,100
I'm sorry, Kirito.
I can't remember anything, after all.

711
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:50,480
Even though I can remember
buying this house in ALO so clearly,

712
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,650
when it comes to SAO, there's nothing.

713
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:54,280
Mommy!

714
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:59,070
I'm sorry, Yui.
I know they're our precious memories.

715
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:03,790
I'm going to see if I can find out
what's going on in Ordinal Scale.

716
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:08,040
I'm sure I'll find a clue
that will help you regain your memories.

717
00:59:09,290 --> 00:59:11,130
Thank you, Yui.

718
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:19,890
Even if I can't remember anything now,
it is true that I lived in this house with you, right?

719
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:20,890
Yes.

720
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:28,770
I'll go make us some tea.

721
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:30,270
I'll help out, too!

722
00:59:30,350 --> 00:59:34,110
No. I'll do it. It'll be a nice change of pace.

723
01:00:26,830 --> 01:00:31,250
I'm now more powerful
than Lightning Flash and the Black Swordsman.

724
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:33,080
Me, of all people!

725
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:36,920
Seriously, I owe it all to Ordinal Scale.

726
01:01:10,450 --> 01:01:13,250
Soon, I can deliver what I promised to her.

727
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:21,420
Hello?

728
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:26,720
How's your injury?

729
01:01:27,810 --> 01:01:30,100
Just the way it looks. Ouch!

730
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:32,730
Sorry to worry you.

731
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:36,360
Klein, has anything about you changed?

732
01:01:37,770 --> 01:01:39,820
Do you remember what happened in SAO?

733
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:48,120
Well, when I try to remember,
it's like my head is in a haze.

734
01:01:48,990 --> 01:01:52,830
Well, but it wasn't all fun times, right?

735
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:57,540
So I figure, if that's how it's gonna be, so be it.

736
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:11,270
<i>I can't wait to see the meteor shower!

737
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,530
<i>Welcome to Augma!

738

Subject: Warning about old SAD bosses
It's possible your memory might be impaired
if you fight the old SAO bosses in OS.
Two of my friends are suffering from it.
Everyone, don't fight the old SAD bosses, it's dangerous!

739
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:34,910
002 That's impossible
003 No way
004 You're watching too many sci-fi movies
005 You want the points for yourself that bad?

740
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,710
006 If that was true, it'd make the headlines
007 Come up with a better lie...
008 lololol
009 Boring! I wonder where it'll appear today?

741
01:02:36,790 --> 01:02:38,960
010 Yeah, point hogger
011 Maybe it'll appear at Minato Ward's warehouses...
012 No, maybe around Roppongi Hills?

742
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:39,790
Dammit!

743
01:02:44,210 --> 01:02:46,550
Search Ordinal Scale rankings!

744
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:03,360
Hey!

745
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:06,610
S-Sorry about that.

746
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:07,860
Let's go.

747
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:08,740
Yeah.

748
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:20,500
I can't tell if this was simply an accident,
or done intentionally.

749
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:25,340
But if it's the latter,
the same thing may continue to happen.

750
01:03:25,550 --> 01:03:34,350
You mean, other SAO survivors playing Ordinal Scale
could lose their memories like Asuna?

751
01:03:36,350 --> 01:03:39,690
<i>If I get taken out now,
I'll lose my memories, too.

752
01:03:40,770 --> 01:03:43,190
<i>If I lose my memories of those two years...

753
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:46,190
<i>Can I be with Asuna like I always have?

754
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:51,530
Daddy, I'm sorry!
I couldn't find the player named Eiji.

755
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:56,370
I couldn't get any information from just his name
and the visual data of his previous battle.

756
01:03:56,450 --> 01:03:57,200
I see.

757
01:03:57,290 --> 01:03:58,870
Do your best, Daddy.

758
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:02,540
I'll be gathering data throughout this battle,
and find something to go on!

759
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:05,090
Right, I know you will.
I'm counting on you, Yui!

760
01:04:05,170 --> 01:04:05,750
Right!

761
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,220
Someone's pretty pumped up, huh?

762
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:10,720
Sinon, why are you here?

763
01:04:10,970 --> 01:04:14,260
You told everyone
it's too risky to fight the bosses,

764
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:16,100
but youâ€™re doing it anyway.

765
01:04:16,390 --> 01:04:19,140
But it really is dangerous.

766
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:22,350
If you get killed by the boss,
you'll be just like Asuna--

767
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:26,360
I'll be fine. After all, I'm not an SAO survivor.

768
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:30,900
As long as I donâ€™t have any memories to scan,
nothing can happen to me. Right, Yui?

769
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:34,070
Yes, I assume so.

770
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,080
But there's no proof--

771
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:38,660
If youâ€™re that worried,
then make sure you protect me, all right?

772
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:41,830
Daddy, please look out for Sinon!

773
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:48,920
- Ordinal Scale, activate!
- Ordinal Scale, activate!

774
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:02,230
That's...

775
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:07,480
The floor 18 boss, Dire Tusk?
Wasn't today the floor 13 boss?

776
01:05:07,690 --> 01:05:12,450
Currently, ten monsters are appearing
in multiple locations across the city!

777
01:05:12,530 --> 01:05:14,280
That's what I call splurging.

778
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:18,200
In addition,
the bosses' locations are being shuffled!

779
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:23,870
- That really is the Dire Tusk.
- All right.

780
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:37,430
It's going to switch
to long-distance mode in a second.

781
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:39,720
We'll play it by the book, all right?

782
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:45,060
What does it think it's doing?

783
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:47,190
Get away!

784
01:05:58,580 --> 01:05:59,580
On, crap!

785
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:21,720
- That's it!
- Go! Go!

786
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:31,940
You're attacking too much!

787
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:03,560
You bastard!

788
01:07:16,650 --> 01:07:18,450
So he wasn't here today, huh?

789
01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:19,660
Impressive!

790
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:21,370
My bad. You saved me.

791
01:07:21,450 --> 01:07:23,580
You can pay me back with cake in Ginza, okay?

792
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:26,080
Will you let me off the hook
if I give you my beef bowl coupon?

793
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:28,120
I donâ€™t want that!

794
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:30,580
All right, then at least
give me a ride home on your bike.

795
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:33,380
Yuna?

796
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:39,340
Please wait!

797
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:40,930
Who are you?

798
01:07:46,350 --> 01:07:50,940
I'm sorry, Daddy.
I was this close, but I got blocked.

799
01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:54,780
Although I was able to confirm
that a mysterious program would activate

800
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:58,530
only when specific players
were damaged by the boss.

801
01:07:58,610 --> 01:07:59,610
Is that so?

802
01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:00,450
Dammit!

803
01:08:02,570 --> 01:08:03,910
Want something to drink?

804
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,170
<i>Search...

805
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:19,800
That's right.

806
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:24,010
Yui, do you remember which direction
the girl in the hoodie was pointing?

807
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:25,810
Yes. Why do you ask?

808
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:28,560
I want you to plot it over a map of Tokyo.

809
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:37,980
0o-okayama in Setagaya Ward?

810
01:08:38,070 --> 01:08:39,650
Yui, what's here?

811
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:43,570
Daddy, this is where
the Toto Institute of Technology is located.

812
01:08:43,910 --> 01:08:45,660
So this is where I'm supposed to go?

813
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:50,830
I'm going to cross-reference Toto Institute
and Eiji's player data and run a search!

814
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:55,420
This person...

815
01:08:56,210 --> 01:08:59,670
It's the Augma's designer,
Professor Tetsuhiro Shigemura!

816
01:09:02,260 --> 01:09:03,640
The Augma...

817
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:07,140
Toto Institute of Technology

818
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:13,940
The most glaring flaw in the full-dive VR device
would be the full-dive function itself.

819
01:09:14,270 --> 01:09:21,780
The risks of cutting off all of one's physical senses
in order to play a VB game are incalculable.

820
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:26,240
Needless to say, applications
for full-dive technology aren't limited to games.

821
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:30,080
Communication, browsing, digital production...

822
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:36,960
But in truth, these can be done with sight,
hearing, and limited tactile information.

823
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:39,550
So, rather than a dangerous full-dive device,

824
01:09:39,630 --> 01:09:44,510
one should be able to choose
a safe AR device instead.

825
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:48,760
Does anyone have any questions so far?

826
01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:53,600
All right, you there.

827
01:09:54,810 --> 01:09:59,900
I believe that AR machines come with dangers
that donâ€™t exist in full-dive machines.

828
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:01,820
What are your thoughts on that?

829
01:10:01,990 --> 01:10:06,660
Do you mean something like traffic accidents
while wearing such devices?

830
01:10:06,820 --> 01:10:09,740
No. I mean that the information
added by the machine

831
01:10:09,870 --> 01:10:13,250
could potentially invade
the user's perception of reality.

832
01:10:13,330 --> 01:10:16,750
Full-dive technology
transforms a virtual world into reality.

833
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:20,420
But doesn't AR technology
make the real world virtual?

834
01:10:24,010 --> 01:10:27,760
I'll answer that question next time.
That's it for today.

835
01:10:28,510 --> 01:10:30,220
I'll get to the point.

836
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:34,680
Do you know someone named Eiji,
who's ranked No. 2 in Ordinal Scale?

837
01:10:35,350 --> 01:10:36,270
I'm not sure.

838
01:10:36,350 --> 01:10:38,810
Wasn't he in your lab?

839
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:41,270
I have a lot of students, you know.

840
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:47,320
Then, are you aware that SAO survivors
are suffering memory loss due to the Augma?

841
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:50,370
Doesn't the Augma
have a hidden function

842
01:10:50,450 --> 01:10:53,830
that scans the user's memories
while the device is worn?

843
01:10:55,540 --> 01:11:00,540
Kikuoka of the Ministry told me
you just wanted to audit my seminar.

844
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:05,590
The Augma having an irregular function equipped
will be uncovered right away under scrutiny.

845
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:10,390
And if that fact is revealed,
the Augma will be shelved like the NerveGear.

846
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:14,720
Do you really want to follow the same path
as your student, Akihiko Kayaba?

847
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:17,890
What are you talking about?

848
01:11:18,190 --> 01:11:21,770
Even if such memory scanning
or whatever you call it were possible,

849
01:11:21,820 --> 01:11:26,320
why would it be a problem
for them to lose their memories of SAO?

850
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:30,030
There's a saying, "Blessed are the forgetful,
for they get the better even of their blunders."

851
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:35,620
Donâ€™t you think that those survivors
want to forget their terrifying past?

852
01:11:36,290 --> 01:11:39,170
Next time, get yourself an official appointment.

853
01:11:39,290 --> 01:11:43,250
Of course, that doesn't mean
my schedule will be open for you.

854
01:11:51,550 --> 01:11:54,220
Professor, you build robots, too?

855
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:56,890
Excuse me.

856
01:12:05,030 --> 01:12:08,190
<i>That's right,
Prof. Shigemura does have a daughter.

857
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:12,030
<i>Actually, he had one.
But she passed away two years ago.

858
01:12:12,450 --> 01:12:22,920
Yuuna Shigemura

859
01:12:24,130 --> 01:12:27,460
What does this mean? What is he trying to do?

860
01:12:27,550 --> 01:12:32,260
<i>Like the professor said, maybe it's meant
as counseling for the SAO survivors.

861
01:12:33,090 --> 01:12:37,810
At any rate, it's highly possible that
the Augma's equipped with a dangerous function.

862
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:41,770
Mr. Kikuoka, can't you use your authority
to shut down the service?

863
01:12:41,810 --> 01:12:44,270
Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications

864
01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:44,560
I've been continuing to analyze this issue,

865
01:12:44,650 --> 01:12:47,900
but we're up against a colossal project linked to
the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.

866
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:50,700
I can't act unless we find solid evidence.

867
01:12:50,740 --> 01:12:52,780
It's going to take some time.

868
01:12:52,950 --> 01:12:56,160
<i>There are a lot of SAO survivors
among the Ordinal Scale players.

869
01:12:56,830 --> 01:12:59,410
If they happen to fight the bosses
from Old Aincrad,

870
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,870
there's going to be more and more cases
of memory loss.

871
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:04,250
<i>I'll do the best that I can.

872
01:13:04,330 --> 01:13:09,380
<i>Klein and his friends in the hospital
all seemed to have the same symptoms.

873
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:12,680
<i>Although their external injuries
were more troubling than their memories.

874
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:16,510
<i>Kirito, if possible,
try not to fight any more bosses.

875
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:19,680
<i>If you lose your memory as well,
that will be troublesome.

876
01:13:31,820 --> 01:13:34,280
Asuna Yuuki

877
01:13:37,330 --> 01:13:38,280
What's up?

878
01:13:38,990 --> 01:13:41,790
<i>Well, I just wanted to hear your voice.

879
01:13:41,910 --> 01:13:42,910
Is that right?

880
01:13:44,870 --> 01:13:48,040
Listen, Asuna.
Do you think I could see you now?

881
01:13:48,710 --> 01:13:51,340
Oh, uh, if it's not a good time, that's okay.

882
01:13:51,550 --> 01:13:56,140
<i>No, it's fine.
I'm just a little scared to go outside.

883
01:13:56,260 --> 01:13:59,310
Gotcha. Then I'll head over to your place.

884
01:13:59,470 --> 01:14:02,810
I'm in Oo-okayama right now,
so I'm about 20 minutes away.

885
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:06,270
P-Pardon the intrusion!

886
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:10,480
You don't have to be that formal.
It's fine! Nobody's home right now.

887
01:14:10,570 --> 01:14:13,700
Y-Yeah, but... It's my first time--

888
01:14:13,820 --> 01:14:16,410
Do you think I should've brought a gift?

889
01:14:16,490 --> 01:14:18,830
That's not necessary! Sheesh.

890
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:20,240
Come on, this way.

891
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:28,170
Someone told me that all survivors
want to forget their terrifying pasts.

892
01:14:28,290 --> 01:14:31,210
In a way, that might be true.

893
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:36,010
Yes, a lot of terrifying and sad things happened.

894
01:14:36,510 --> 01:14:43,100
But those two years we spent in SAO
are precious memories that define who we are now.

895
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:51,270
So this is the "future room" I've heard about.

896
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:56,280
But its atmosphere reminds me
of your room back in Selmburg.

897
01:14:57,910 --> 01:14:59,990
I'll go get us something to drink, okay?

898
01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:01,080
Sure.

899
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:02,580
Make yourself at home.

900
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:34,110
<i>To the me of tomorrow.

901
01:15:34,820 --> 01:15:37,450
<i>I haven 't been writing in this diary lately,

902
01:15:37,530 --> 01:15:41,660
<i>but as I might forget what's happened
since I've returned t0 the real world, too,

903
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:43,950
<i>I'm going to write down
howl feel right now.

904
01:15:45,330 --> 01:15:49,040
<i>It's already been four years
since I met Kirito, hasn't it?

905
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:54,550
<i>All of my memories with Kirito
are sparkling like jewels.

906
01:15:55,510 --> 01:16:01,340
<i>Even if I end up losing more and more
of my memories because of Ordinal Scale,

907
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:06,390
<i>if I can keep accumulating new memories with him,
I think I should be fine.

908
01:16:07,060 --> 01:16:13,360
<i>According to my calendar, I'm to go with Kirito
to the mountains in Saitama to see the stars soon,

909
01:16:13,650 --> 01:16:17,530
<i>but I've completely lost the memory
of the day we made that promise.

910
01:16:18,650 --> 01:16:25,240
<i>I've re-read this diary, and it seems like
Kirito is going to give me some kind of present,

911
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:28,500
<i>but I wonder if he 'II forgive me
for forgetting our promise.

912
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:34,210
<i>I want to give him something in return,
but since I'm not allowed to work part-time,

913
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:37,840
<i>I 'd like to use the points and pocket money
I've saved up on a gift for him.

914
01:16:40,050 --> 01:16:41,720
<i>My beloved Kirito.

915
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:47,270
<i>If I ever forget even Kirito...
If I ever lose these feelings...

916
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:51,060
<i>If I end up not being able
to make new memories...

917
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:54,360
<i>Thinking about that really scares me.

918
01:16:55,770 --> 01:17:00,610
<i>I pray that the me of tomorrow
won't have lost what I'm feeling right now.

919
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:10,460
It's all right.
I donâ€™t mind you reading it, Kirito.

920
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:30,180
Asuna. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

921
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:35,900
I love you, Kirito. I love you so much!

922
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:40,610
Even if I lose all my memories of SAO,

923
01:17:41,110 --> 01:17:43,700
this feeling is the one thing
that will never, ever change.

924
01:17:46,410 --> 01:17:51,700
Me, too, Asuna. I love you.
I always have, and I always will.

925
01:18:04,510 --> 01:18:07,180
I'm going to get your memories back
no matter what.

926
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:10,350
So I want you to trust me, Asuna.

927
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:17,310
A shooting star!

928
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:20,440
Hey, Eiji, tomorrow's the day.

929
01:18:20,530 --> 01:18:24,400
The day when my dream of singing
in a gigantic venue comes true!

930
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:26,490
Right. Are you nervous?

931
01:18:26,530 --> 01:18:28,120
Nope, not at all.

932
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:31,950
After all, I get to sing before a huge crowd!
I've got to enjoy myself.

933
01:18:32,330 --> 01:18:35,540
And that's where I'm going to
become the No. 1 diva, right?

934
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:40,000
That's right. You're going to
become this world's No. 1, once and for all.

935
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:42,460
Hey, read to me from that book again, Eiji.

936
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:44,970
All right. Sure.

937
01:18:45,470 --> 01:18:48,180
So where do you show up in this book, Eiji?

938
01:18:48,340 --> 01:18:49,930
That's what I'd like to hear.

939
01:18:50,930 --> 01:18:52,100
I'm not in it.

940
01:18:52,270 --> 01:18:54,520
I donâ€™t appear in this book.

941
01:18:55,020 --> 01:18:59,020
Those of us who couldn't fight
aren't worth remembering.

942
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:01,270
YES?

943
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:03,820
Jeez!

944
01:19:04,030 --> 01:19:07,160
<i>You're certainly taking your time
getting this job done.

945
01:19:07,490 --> 01:19:10,320
<i>Someone's caught on to our plan.
You need to hurry.

946
01:19:10,450 --> 01:19:12,080
Yes, sir. I understand.

947
01:19:12,290 --> 01:19:15,870
<i>I've already set up the road map
to the final phase.

948
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:18,790
<i>You'll keep your promise, won't you?

949
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:21,460
Of course I will. How could I ever forget?

950
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:23,050
<i>I'm counting an you, sir.

951
01:19:23,130 --> 01:19:25,010
<i>By the way, about Yuna,

952
01:19:25,130 --> 01:19:29,510
from time to time, her actions indicate
she has interests other than singing.

953
01:19:29,590 --> 01:19:32,010
<i>That's probably due to
her self-preservation program.

954
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:35,140
<i>Just think of it as a sign
that the plan is proceeding.

955
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:37,350
Understood.

956
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:00,830
Treasures of Meiji Shrine

957
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:57,890
Yuuna, right?

958
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:03,400
Where is this place? Is it a dream, or...

959
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:06,860
Dreams and virtual worlds
are more or less the same thing.

960
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:10,900
Once you wake up,
everything becomes an ephemeral memory.

961
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:11,990
Memory...

962
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:14,950
It could be that it was all just a dream.

963
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:19,160
You clearing that death game,
and coming back to the real world.

964
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:23,080
When you open your eyes,
you might still be trapped inside Aincrad.

965
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:25,290
Hasn't that thought crossed your mind?

966
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:30,010
Sure it has,
but it's not something I've ever wanted.

967
01:21:30,090 --> 01:21:33,510
I see. So you were in SAO, after all.

968
01:21:34,340 --> 01:21:36,680
Are you Prof. Shigemura's daughter?

969
01:21:36,970 --> 01:21:38,310
So youâ€™re alive?

970
01:21:39,470 --> 01:21:43,060
Why did you send me to see the professor,
and what did you want me to do?

971
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:46,610
Why did the professor
steal Asuna's memories of SAO?

972
01:21:46,730 --> 01:21:48,690
What exactly is the Augma?

973
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:57,280
<i>O, stars that illuminate the sky...

974
01:21:57,410 --> 01:22:02,660
<i>Soft breeze drifting o'er the hills...

975
01:22:02,790 --> 01:22:07,380
<i>Please grant thine blessings to
those travelers who

976
01:22:07,460 --> 01:22:13,380
<i>- are passing through the ancient city.<i>song is...

977
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:19,760
All I want is to go on singing.
That's what I wish for.

978
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:23,560
What am I supposed to do?
What can I do to save Asuna?

979
01:22:24,230 --> 01:22:27,020
If you want to get Asuna's memories back,

980
01:22:27,310 --> 01:22:30,730
your current ranking number
isn't nearly high enough.

981
01:22:31,030 --> 01:22:33,780
Now, then, it's almost time. Wake up.

982
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:38,410
H-Hey, are you okay?

983
01:22:38,740 --> 01:22:40,080
Y-Yeah.

984
01:22:40,410 --> 01:22:43,000
Were you playing that Augma game?

985
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:45,960
I hear it's all the rage these days,
but you better be careful.

986
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:47,920
Try not to fall on your face, okay?

987
01:22:58,510 --> 01:23:01,010
Karaoke Palace

988
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:07,520
So anyway, it seems like Silica's feeling
a little responsible, too.

989
01:23:07,650 --> 01:23:11,570
<i>I had no idea.
If only I could've been in the battles.

990
01:23:12,690 --> 01:23:15,780
Klein got himself hurt
and ended up in the hospital,

991
01:23:15,860 --> 01:23:17,860
so it might be a good thing
you couldn't make it.

992
01:23:17,950 --> 01:23:21,580
Kirito told the other players
not to fight the bosses,

993
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:24,910
but then he fought by himself
in an Ordinal Scale battle.

994
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:27,040
Although I did kind of help him.

995
01:23:28,330 --> 01:23:34,550
<i>Th-Then, I 'll teach him some kendo moves
he can use in that game's battles!

996
01:23:35,970 --> 01:23:37,970
Such beautiful sibling love.

997
01:23:38,050 --> 01:23:40,640
Liz, we're going to sing together next!

998
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:43,470
Since the concert's tomorrow,
we've got to study up!

999
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45,180
Now, please take this mic!

1000
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:50,600
Is this their way of cheering her up?

1001
01:23:52,610 --> 01:23:55,280
<i>Well, Asuna does look like
she's enjoying herself.?

1002
01:23:55,860 --> 01:23:57,820
So I guess it's okay?

1003
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:06,750
H-Hey, what's wrong?

1004
01:24:06,870 --> 01:24:07,710
Are you okay?

1005
01:24:16,210 --> 01:24:17,300
Just like yesterday,

1006
01:24:17,420 --> 01:24:21,550
the bosses from floors 20 to 30
are appearing throughout the city!

1007
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,680
I'm taking the shortest route
to take them all out!

1008
01:24:36,150 --> 01:24:39,700
That guy's pretty much
inflicting all the damage himself.

1009
01:24:39,780 --> 01:24:41,030
Awesome.

1010
01:24:46,370 --> 01:24:47,950
Wh-What the hell?

1011
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:51,870
Donâ€™t get so worked up over a game.
It's just for fun, right?

1012
01:24:55,210 --> 01:24:56,050
Move!

1013
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:08,720
All right, time for a special stage.
Give it your all, you guys!

1014
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:10,560
Lucky us!

1015
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:50,470
Congratulations!

1016
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:56,360
I see you've finally learned how
to fight in this game, Mr. Black Swordsman.

1017
01:25:56,810 --> 01:25:58,360
YOU!

1018
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:09,030
A message from "E" has arrived.

1019
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:12,750
Come to Yuna's concert.
I'll return Lightning Flash's memories there.

1020
01:26:42,610 --> 01:26:45,360
Today is finally here!!
Yuna's Live!
@ the New National Stadium Arena

1021
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:01,500
Wow, Yuna's popularity is mind-blowing.

1022
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,050
My throat's sore from singing too much.

1023
01:27:04,130 --> 01:27:06,340
You got yourself way too fired up.

1024
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:08,680
Silica, thank you for yesterday!

1025
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:10,260
D-Donâ€™t mention it!

1026
01:27:10,390 --> 01:27:13,470
Still, it's too bad for those guys, huh?

1027
01:27:13,890 --> 01:27:15,270
Huh? Where's Kirito?

1028
01:27:15,390 --> 01:27:18,190
He said he had to go to the bathroom.

1029
01:27:27,530 --> 01:27:29,030
I'm here, as promised.

1030
01:27:31,780 --> 01:27:34,950
You're giving Asuna's memories back,
even if I have to force you.

1031
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:38,000
Please donâ€™t rush me, Mr. Black Swordsman.

1032
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:40,380
And youâ€™re Nautilus, right?

1033
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:43,670
The one who couldn't confront his fear of death
and refused to fight?

1034
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:44,960
I'm Eiji now!

1035
01:27:47,510 --> 01:27:49,550
That's ancient history.

1036
01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:53,310
I'm surprised you even knew about me.

1037
01:27:53,470 --> 01:27:56,430
I know someone who does. They told me.

1038
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:02,400
Seducing Lightning Flash wasn't enough,
so now you're going after Yuna?

1039
01:28:02,730 --> 01:28:04,320
What are you talking about?

1040
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:07,900
Oh, never mind.
You've come here so casually,

1041
01:28:07,990 --> 01:28:11,070
but do you really think you can beat me,
the No. <i>2 ranked player?

1042
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:15,290
How will I know unless I try?
It's not like youâ€™re No. 1.

1043
01:28:21,790 --> 01:28:23,790
- Ordinal Scale, activate!
- Ordinal Scale, activate!

1044
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:13,390
I admit I took advantage of my position

1045
01:29:13,470 --> 01:29:18,720
as external board director of Argus
to give Yuuna a NerveGear and SAO.

1046
01:29:19,390 --> 01:29:22,060
I just wanted to look good
in my daughter's eyes.

1047
01:29:22,850 --> 01:29:26,480
But my stupidity is what killed her.

1048
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:28,440
Yuuna!

1049
01:29:36,830 --> 01:29:40,620
Just as expected of the one
who guided players to clear SAO.

1050
01:29:40,790 --> 01:29:44,000
Is that all No. <i>2 can do?
It doesnâ€™t amount to much!

1051
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:53,260
In the end, people only remember the players
who fought on the front lines.

1052
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:56,350
Weaklings like Yuuna and me
are always overlooked!

1053
01:29:57,100 --> 01:29:59,010
You were with Yuuna in SAO?

1054
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:00,020
Yeah, I was!

1055
01:30:02,020 --> 01:30:05,020
I was with her
at the moment she disappeared, too!

1056
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:07,360
You've no idea how I cursed my weakness!

1057
01:30:07,690 --> 01:30:11,490
Even when someone precious to me was in danger,
I couldn't even move an inch!

1058
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:19,450
Yuuna's brain was so damaged by the NerveGear,
it was impossible to save or repair it.

1059
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:23,620
But if I can acquire memories of Yuuna
from the other SAO players

1060
01:30:23,710 --> 01:30:29,130
and combine those fragments,
I can use Deep Learning

1061
01:30:29,550 --> 01:30:33,170
to resurrect Yuuna as an AI.

1062
01:30:44,730 --> 01:30:50,520
The numbers in the Ordinal System are absolute.
The one given No. 1 becomes immortal.

1063
01:30:51,070 --> 01:30:54,030
It was you who designed it that way,
wasn't it, Kayaba?

1064
01:30:56,200 --> 01:31:00,660
Therefore, she's "una." Latin for "one," then?

1065
01:31:01,660 --> 01:31:05,710
In contrast to the Cardinal System,
which controlled Aincrad using cardinal numbers,

1066
01:31:05,790 --> 01:31:08,920
the Ordinal System controls
using ordinal numbers.

1067
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:14,550
You discovered the system I'd discarded
during the early development stage of SAO,

1068
01:31:14,630 --> 01:31:17,380
and resurrected it into a new game.

1069
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:22,220
True, the man I was before
might have done the same.

1070
01:31:22,890 --> 01:31:26,810
But you see, Professor,
the man I am now believes...

1071
01:31:27,690 --> 01:31:30,940
in the existence of a power
that transcends the system itself.

1072
01:31:34,650 --> 01:31:39,990
Who cares if we take away memories
of that crap game, SAD?

1073
01:31:40,990 --> 01:31:44,290
Is this the secret behind your power?

1074
01:31:46,540 --> 01:31:49,290
Dammit!

1075
01:31:58,970 --> 01:32:04,720
I can't lose to someone who denies his past self
just because he suffered once.

1076
01:32:07,230 --> 01:32:10,810
All right, tell me how
to get Asuna's memories back!

1077
01:32:34,670 --> 01:32:37,340
- What's going on?
- Come on! Is that all?

1078
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:50,020
That was fun!

1079
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:22,220
It's too late now.

1080
01:33:22,970 --> 01:33:25,890
Almost all of the SAO survivors are here.

1081
01:33:26,890 --> 01:33:32,310
We're going to scan the brains
of every SAO survivor in this venue,

1082
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:34,350
and take their memories of SAO.

1083
01:33:34,940 --> 01:33:37,150
And then we're going to bring Yuuna back to life.

1084
01:33:37,230 --> 01:33:39,480
What are you talking about?

1085
01:33:39,570 --> 01:33:41,820
All right, it's started.

1086
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:43,990
There's no stopping it now.

1087
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:55,250
<i>This is what I learned from Kamura,
the manufacturer of the Augma.

1088
01:33:55,460 --> 01:34:00,590
<i>Right now, the drones flying inside the stadium
are equipped with a wireless power feed function

1089
01:34:00,670 --> 01:34:03,680
<i>that can boost the output
of the Augmas themselves.

1090
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:05,090
What does that mean?

1091
01:34:05,180 --> 01:34:08,350
<i>If they run that scan inside the stadium,

1092
01:34:08,390 --> 01:34:12,020
<i>it might not just be partial memory loss
we 're looking at.

1093
01:34:12,770 --> 01:34:14,020
You mean that...

1094
01:34:14,060 --> 01:34:15,100
<i>That's right.

1095
01:34:15,310 --> 01:34:20,610
<i>Like the NerveGear, the scan could
damage the brain, and even lead to death.

1096
01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:31,120
<i>I'll stop the professor.

1097
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:35,120
<i>Kirito, tell the audience in that stadium
to take off their Augmas.

1098
01:34:39,460 --> 01:34:40,800
What the hell is this?

1099
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:42,300
What's going on?

1100
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:46,180
- Let us out!
- What's going on?

1101
01:34:59,820 --> 01:35:00,770
Asuna!

1102
01:35:05,990 --> 01:35:07,990
Asuna! Sorry I'm late.

1103
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:11,240
Kirito!

1104
01:35:12,490 --> 01:35:16,250
Looks like we're going to have to
leave the venue entirely to Kirito.

1105
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:17,620
Let's hurry!

1106
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:24,300
Yuuna?

1107
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:27,720
Dad, I want you to stop this now.

1108
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:30,510
No, youâ€™re not Yuuna yet.

1109
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:33,470
I donâ€™t want to come back to life.

1110
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:40,060
You're still at the level of AI where your
self-preservation program is making you say this.

1111
01:35:40,310 --> 01:35:42,610
It won't be long now, so just wait patiently.

1112
01:35:42,690 --> 01:35:43,940
Dad...

1113
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:47,610
I'm having an AI-type crawler gather the data.

1114
01:35:48,110 --> 01:35:49,950
She's just finishing up.

1115
01:35:50,410 --> 01:35:53,790
It's her final task.
She really did a fine job.

1116
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:55,450
Donâ€™t do it, Dad!

1117
01:35:55,580 --> 01:35:58,120
If you run a high-output scan inside,

1118
01:35:58,250 --> 01:36:00,790
the resonance effect might not
just take their memories, but kill them!

1119
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:02,290
You be quiet, Yuuna!

1120
01:36:16,140 --> 01:36:19,190
<i>Catastrophe in popular VR game
10,000 people trapped in the game

1121
01:36:19,310 --> 01:36:24,150
If I can bring you back to life,
I'll gladly sell my soul to the devil!

1122
01:36:25,230 --> 01:36:31,910
Even if... even if it means
following the same path as that man.

1123
01:36:31,990 --> 01:36:34,870
All I want is to get that moment back.

1124
01:36:48,630 --> 01:36:49,260
Give me that!

1125
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:00,940
So he's not making it easy for us, huh?

1126
01:37:01,020 --> 01:37:04,270
Find out where that camera's connected.

1127
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:10,110
I guess we're even now, Kikuoka.

1128
01:37:14,780 --> 01:37:18,080
I'm sorry. I lost to one of the players.

1129
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:20,910
But now all that's left to do
is the simultaneous scan.

1130
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:24,580
We can finally bring back Yuna... Yuuna...

1131
01:37:24,710 --> 01:37:27,460
<i>You still have a final task, don't you?

1132
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:28,460
What?

1133
01:37:28,550 --> 01:37:31,970
<i>I want you to supply me
with your memories of her as well.

1134
01:37:32,630 --> 01:37:37,310
<i>Eiji. You were with Yuuna the longest
in SAO, weren't you?

1135
01:37:37,390 --> 01:37:38,930
<i>What else did you expect?

1136
01:37:39,980 --> 01:37:43,980
<i>I have no use for someone
who couldn't even master the equipment I provided.!

1137
01:37:44,440 --> 01:37:45,400
No way.

1138
01:37:45,650 --> 01:37:49,900
But you said that you'd make sure
I could be with Yuuna forever!

1139
01:37:50,110 --> 01:37:51,190
<i>Farewell.

1140
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:11,720
- Yuuna?
- Kirito, give me a hand!

1141
01:38:12,170 --> 01:38:15,090
At this rate, everyone here will be in danger!

1142
01:38:15,340 --> 01:38:18,350
When the average of
all of their emotive counters goes over 10,000,

1143
01:38:18,430 --> 01:38:21,850
a high-output scan will begin,
inflicting damage on their brains!

1144
01:38:21,930 --> 01:38:23,100
R-Right!

1145
01:38:23,310 --> 01:38:23,980
Everybody!

1146
01:38:24,190 --> 01:38:26,270
Take off your Augmas right now!

1147
01:38:26,310 --> 01:38:28,190
Take them off or you'll be in danger!

1148
01:38:29,610 --> 01:38:30,610
It's no use.

1149
01:38:30,780 --> 01:38:33,780
The reason he made the boss monsters appear
in all the previous events

1150
01:38:33,820 --> 01:38:35,910
was to make sure everyone
would fight them here!

1151
01:38:35,950 --> 01:38:37,200
Then what should I do?

1152
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:39,120
The place where we met yesterday...

1153
01:38:39,450 --> 01:38:43,460
That was floor 100 in Old Aincrad.
Defeat its boss monster, Black Swordsman!

1154
01:38:44,370 --> 01:38:45,830
If you do that, I'm sure...

1155
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:50,050
I'll unlock the Augma's full-dive function now,
so sit in that chair!

1156
01:38:50,380 --> 01:38:52,050
The Augma has a full-dive function?

1157
01:38:52,340 --> 01:38:55,550
The Augma is just a version
of the NerveGear with limited functions.

1158
01:38:55,630 --> 01:38:56,800
Now hurry!

1159
01:38:59,470 --> 01:39:00,390
Got it!

1160
01:39:01,930 --> 01:39:02,930
You guys...

1161
01:39:07,190 --> 01:39:08,230
- Let's do this.
- Right!

1162
01:39:08,310 --> 01:39:09,440
Daddy, good luck!

1163
01:39:09,730 --> 01:39:11,320
Yui, take care of Asuna!

1164
01:39:12,230 --> 01:39:13,190
Kirito...

1165
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:17,240
It's all right. I'll be back in no time.
I'm going to save everyone else here, too.

1166
01:39:17,320 --> 01:39:19,410
Trust me, and wait for me, Asuna.

1167
01:39:21,990 --> 01:39:22,950
Kirito!

1168
01:39:23,450 --> 01:39:25,410
When I get back, let's keep our promise.

1169
01:39:30,090 --> 01:39:31,250
Link start!

1170
01:39:40,550 --> 01:39:43,930
So this is floor 100 of Aincrad, the Ruby Palace.

1171
01:39:44,310 --> 01:39:47,640
Who knew we'd be seeing this place
after two years.

1172
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:01,370
Agil!

1173
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:08,960
So this is SAO's true last boss?

1174
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:10,500
Let's go!

1175
01:40:33,690 --> 01:40:34,360
Switch!

1176
01:40:36,070 --> 01:40:37,150
Switch!

1177
01:40:54,630 --> 01:40:55,670
Damn!

1178
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:57,010
No way!

1179
01:40:57,090 --> 01:40:59,630
We have no chance of beating that thing!

1180
01:41:18,650 --> 01:41:20,200
I'm sorry, Asuna.

1181
01:41:20,950 --> 01:41:28,040
Your memory was scanned to extract information
about me, a player who died in Aincrad.

1182
01:41:28,870 --> 01:41:34,670
My father is inflicting the terror of being killed
by a boss monster onto every SAO survivor,

1183
01:41:34,750 --> 01:41:37,590
to run a simultaneous high-output scan
on their memories.

1184
01:41:38,050 --> 01:41:42,590
If that happens, it might leave your brains
with irreparable damage.

1185
01:41:42,630 --> 01:41:44,140
It might even kill them.

1186
01:41:44,180 --> 01:41:45,850
N-No way!

1187
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:48,220
Mommy!

1188
01:41:50,230 --> 01:41:52,980
<i>If I remove this, Kirito will be saved.

1189
01:41:53,020 --> 01:41:57,020
<i>But then Kirito won't he able
to save the people he's trying to save.

1190
01:42:06,870 --> 01:42:07,700
Yuna?

1191
01:42:08,410 --> 01:42:13,160
If you lost your life in SAO,
it was because you left the safe zone.

1192
01:42:13,210 --> 01:42:16,750
It was because you fought a monster
and tried to clear the floor!

1193
01:42:17,250 --> 01:42:18,960
I'm going to fight again.

1194
01:42:19,630 --> 01:42:22,420
Yui, I'm going to join Kirito.

1195
01:42:22,510 --> 01:42:24,630
All right, Mommy.
I'll catch up as soon as I can.

1196
01:42:29,010 --> 01:42:30,470
Link start!

1197
01:42:32,850 --> 01:42:33,430
Stop it!

1198
01:42:37,190 --> 01:42:37,940
Silica!

1199
01:42:41,110 --> 01:42:41,820
Kirito!

1200
01:42:41,860 --> 01:42:42,990
Silica!

1201
01:42:43,950 --> 01:42:45,110
No!

1202
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:46,280
Run!

1203
01:42:47,410 --> 01:42:48,160
Dammit!

1204
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:02,630
Asuna?

1205
01:43:02,710 --> 01:43:04,090
Silica!

1206
01:43:04,260 --> 01:43:07,180
I'm sorry, it's all my fault!

1207
01:43:07,220 --> 01:43:08,970
You were feeling guilty all this time.

1208
01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:11,100
I'm sorry, Silica.

1209
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:13,930
Asuna!

1210
01:43:18,810 --> 01:43:20,860
Sorry I'm late, you guys!

1211
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:22,650
Are you all right?

1212
01:43:24,240 --> 01:43:26,990
I'm going to fight, too. I can fight, Kirito.

1213
01:43:27,570 --> 01:43:28,660
Right.

1214
01:43:44,670 --> 01:43:47,180
Big Brother! Sorry to make you wait!

1215
01:43:48,510 --> 01:43:51,010
Daddy! Mommy! I brought everyone!

1216
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:56,310
- Looks like fun!
- We're not hereto have fun!

1217
01:43:56,680 --> 01:43:59,520
All right! We're invincible in VB!

1218
01:44:07,740 --> 01:44:08,990
That thing is huge!

1219
01:44:09,660 --> 01:44:10,700
Those guys...

1220
01:44:11,070 --> 01:44:12,160
Time is running out!

1221
01:44:12,330 --> 01:44:13,490
Bombard that thing!

1222
01:44:13,580 --> 01:44:16,370
It's all right! Please use this!

1223
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:25,460
This is...

1224
01:44:26,050 --> 01:44:26,880
Pina!

1225
01:44:29,050 --> 01:44:34,220
I've loaded the saved data
left on the SAO server onto you all.

1226
01:44:34,390 --> 01:44:36,180
Sinon, yours is a special bonus!

1227
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:42,520
All right, you guys, let's go!

1228
01:45:21,730 --> 01:45:22,560
Block that!

1229
01:45:26,020 --> 01:45:26,860
Let's go, Asuna!

1230
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:27,400
Right!

1231
01:45:32,740 --> 01:45:33,570
Missed!

1232
01:45:38,040 --> 01:45:39,040

<i>This is what I can do now...

1234
01:46:15,820 --> 01:46:18,160
- We did it!
- Yay!

1235
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:37,510
<i>Now youâ€™ve cleared it completely, eh, Kirito?

1236
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:38,640
Kayaba?

1237
01:46:38,930 --> 01:46:42,100
<i>But isn't there something
you still need to do?

1238
01:47:45,750 --> 01:47:46,910
It's Yuna!

1239
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:05,180
Why... Why?

1240
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:08,940
I was so close. Yuuna!

1241
01:48:16,440 --> 01:48:18,070
Thank you, Dad.

1242
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:21,160
I'm here in your memories.

1243
01:48:21,620 --> 01:48:22,700
Forever...

1244
01:49:04,780 --> 01:49:06,910
That was a great performance, Yuuna.

1245
01:49:07,370 --> 01:49:08,450
Thank you.

1246
01:49:11,500 --> 01:49:16,840
The data for my main body was partially based
on the Aincrad floor 100 boss's resource script.

1247
01:49:17,050 --> 01:49:20,340
Its language engine is what enabled me to move.

1248
01:49:20,590 --> 01:49:23,970
But the boss has been defeated,
and its saved data will be reset.

1249
01:49:24,350 --> 01:49:27,470
- So I have to say goodbye to you all.
- No way!

1250
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:29,350
I really enjoyed myself.

1251
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:32,650
My dream of singing
before a huge crowd was realized,

1252
01:49:32,770 --> 01:49:34,860
so I couldn't be happier.

1253
01:49:35,980 --> 01:49:38,190
I'm going to return something
I borrowed from you.

1254
01:49:38,860 --> 01:49:41,950
The fear of death
caused your memory impairment.

1255
01:49:42,490 --> 01:49:47,910
But you overcame that and fought.
So I'm sure it'll all come back to you.

1256
01:50:03,220 --> 01:50:06,390
<i>You remembered my dream.

An incident was reported at the live concert

1261
01:51:14,410 --> 01:51:16,040
Congratulations on being discharged!

1262
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:17,540
Are you sure youâ€™re all right?

1263
01:51:17,580 --> 01:51:20,040
Oh, man, that was an ordeal.

1264
01:51:20,090 --> 01:51:22,460
I'd rather do VR for games after all.

1265
01:51:22,550 --> 01:51:24,880
But isn't there more chance
of meeting girls through AR?

1266
01:51:25,220 --> 01:51:29,180
It's no big deal! Games aren't for meeting girls.

1267
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:34,390
Is that a crack about me and my wife?
And you wasted the ticket I gave you!

1268
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:37,520
- What? Ow! What the hell!
- You got a problem?

1269
01:51:37,560 --> 01:51:39,770
Hey, now. Here are some souvenirs!

1270
01:51:39,860 --> 01:51:41,860

at our lodgings,

1273
01:51:45,570 --> 01:51:48,280
but thank goodness
I smuggled my Amusphere along!

1274
01:51:49,820 --> 01:51:52,370
By the way, where are Kirito and Asuna?

1275
01:51:52,580 --> 01:51:55,580
They said they had somewhere to go.
Have you heard anything?

1276
01:51:55,710 --> 01:51:59,540
Well, now, it's all good.
Just forget about them.

1277
01:51:59,580 --> 01:52:00,960
What the hell?

1278
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:05,260
Not showing up to celebrate his best friend
in SAO being discharged? What a jerk!

1279
01:52:05,340 --> 01:52:09,640
I think I'm going to charge just you today.
To reimburse me for that ticket.

1280
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:13,010
What? I thought it was free!
You greedy merchant!

1281

Oh, man...

1282
01:52:15,180 --> 01:52:19,350
I wonder if I'll meet any cute girls on a quest
now that ALO's reopened?

1283
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:20,770
Not a chance!

It really gets pitch dark, huh?

1286
01:52:25,940 --> 01:52:27,860
Yeah. Can you see, Yui?

1287
01:52:27,950 --> 01:52:30,780
<i>Yes, Daddy. I can see just fine!

1288
01:52:30,870 --> 01:52:33,700
<i>Though it is a little greenish overall.

1289
01:52:34,700 --> 01:52:37,790
I never thought the three of us
would really make it here.

1290
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:40,460
In the end, I left the house
without telling my mom.

1291
01:52:41,580 --> 01:52:43,420
A-Are you sure that's okay?

1292
01:52:48,380 --> 01:52:50,380
When we get back, I'll go meet her.

1293
01:52:54,810 --> 01:52:58,890
Asuna, do you remember?
What we promised each other in Aincrad?

1294
01:52:59,140 --> 01:53:00,770
To go see the stars?

1295
01:53:00,810 --> 01:53:03,520
Yeah. Well, that's part of it, but...

1296
01:53:03,810 --> 01:53:08,860
Just kidding. I remember.
That you said you'd give me a present.

1297
01:53:11,700 --> 01:53:13,160
Here, Kirito.

1298
01:53:13,700 --> 01:53:17,160
It felt odd just getting something from you,
so here's something from me.

1299
01:53:18,120 --> 01:53:19,080
Thanks.

1300
01:53:24,340 --> 01:53:27,760
This time, actually put it on my finger,
and let's continue from where we left off.

1301
01:53:43,480 --> 01:53:44,770

the following text was added.

What's the reason
for bringing me here, Kikuoka?

1307
01:59:21,440 --> 01:59:26,910
I'm grateful that I wasn't charged with a crime,
but what are you planning to make me do?

1308
01:59:27,160 --> 01:59:32,870
I was very interested in what I saw of your AI.

1309
01:59:32,950 --> 01:59:36,620
I feel as though I've seen how far
a top-down AI can go.

1310
01:59:37,080 --> 01:59:41,000
However, I do believe
in another future, as well.

and Noboyuki Sugou,

1313
01:59:48,430 --> 01:59:51,850
there's something that
I'd very much like you to see.

1314
01:59:54,470 --> 01:59:56,980
Kikuoka, what on earth is this?

1315
01:59:58,650 --> 02:00:00,650
Welcome to Hath.
