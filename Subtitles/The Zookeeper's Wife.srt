2
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,683
- Hello, Jerzyk.
- Good morning, Miss.

3
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,211
It's a beautiful day.

4
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,960
Good morning.

5
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,327
- Hello. Welcome.
- Good morning.

6
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,370
Good morning. Enjoy yourselves today.

7
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,121
Good morning.

8
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,410
Good morning.

9
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,245
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

10
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,890
Come along, Adam. Time for morning rounds.

11
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,641
Hello, my loves.

12
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,041
Good morning, sweetheart.

13
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,321
Good morning.

14
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,640
How's our girl today?

15
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,085
No problems today, Miss.

16
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,800
Hello, old Kasia.

17
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,080
Yes. Tembo.

18
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,162
What a beautiful girl you are.

19
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,962
Good morning.

20
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,531
- Good morning, darling.
- Good morning, Punia.

21
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,841
Have you come to help me?

22
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,120
The torchlight was flaring in front of me.

23
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,840
Behind me, I could hear the breathing
of a maddened creature.

24
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,526
It was midnight, black as coal.

25
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,440
I couldn't see my hand in front of me,
but I could feel her breath on my neck.

26
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,880
Hot and thick.

27
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,691
I had interfered, and she was angry with me.

28
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,244
She took two steps.

29
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,320
I thought it was the end of me.

30
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,000
I took my rifle, raised it,

31
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,720
and that's when she charged.

32
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,810
There was nothing I could do,
I had to shoot her.

33
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,240
It was the picture of perfection.

34
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,810
An exquisite creature.

35
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,769
A great desecration for me.

36
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,567
But I have to say, her cubs did survive.

37
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,603
They thrived, and have grown to
a proud maturity in my zoo. Cheers.

38
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,244
Herr Heck has taken over
the Berlin Zoo from his father.

39
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,200
And his brother runs the Munich Zoo.

40
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,040
Would you like a canapé, Herr Heck?

41
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,960
It looks delicious, but no. Thank you.

42
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,720
This is Magda Gross, the sculptress.
Perhaps you know of her.

43
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,760
Indeed, yes.

44
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,683
- She also made this...
- Oh!

45
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,121
Excuse me.

46
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,120
And what do you do with yourself, my dear,

47
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,043
while your husband is playing
with his monkeys?

48
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,480
I help him.

49
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,440
Oh, isn't that sweet.

50
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,560
Sweetness is the least of it.

51
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,840
Antonina's a magician.

52
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,560
Thank you. I'll take it.

53
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,920
We met five or six years ago,
didn't we, Frau Zabińska?

54
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Mmm.

55
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,560
I think you've changed your hair.

56
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,721
Yes.

57
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,486
You've only grown more beautiful
in these past years, I have to say.

58
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,007
The look of a stray barn cat, if you ask me.

59
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,560
Did you know that barn cats have
the keenest sense in all of nature?

60
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,405
More astute and fine than
any human being I hope to meet.

61
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,760
Do you play the piano, Frau Zabińska?

62
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,251
A little.

63
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,725
Why don't you play something for us?

64
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,205
I think it's the perfect time to
soothe the savage beast and all that.

65
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,929
Maybe she should play a German waltz.

66
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,801
We may all be learning
the goose-step within a year.

67
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,960
- Stefan, please.
- Isn't that so, Herr Heck?

68
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,280
Not now, please, Stefan.

69
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,683
Well, Hitler wants Poland.

70
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,440
It's what everyone's saying.

71
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,440
I wouldn't know anything
about it, I assure you.

72
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm a zoologist, not a politician.

73
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,725
Mama, Jerzyk needs you! It's Kasia.

74
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,045
Excuse me, everyone.

75
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,402
Be quiet, don't startle her.

76
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,246
Here, stay here.
Hold the light steady for me.

77
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,762
She's not breathing.

78
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,920
I'm here, Kasia.

79
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,401
I'm here.

80
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,681
Hello, Tembo.

81
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,960
Hello, Tembo.

82
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,362
I can bring you overalls, Miss, please.
I can find other men.

83
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,802
There's no time. She's suffocating.

84
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,400
Let me help you, Kasia.

85
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,960
Please, let me help you, my darling.

86
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,200
Let me help you, sweetheart.

87
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,089
I have no rifle, Miss, please!

88
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,526
Hush! Enough now!

89
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,326
Please.

90
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,606
Oh, she's blocked!

91
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,129
No, please, let me do this.

92
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,445
I'm trying, Kasia. I'm trying, my darling.

93
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,320
Wait, wait, wait.

94
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,925
- You should go. You can go.
- Why isn't that man armed?

95
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,840
Whoa, Tembo.

96
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,206
- What's his name?
- Tembo.

97
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,003
Tembo! Tembo. Good. Good, good, good.

98
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,687
We're losing her! Jerzyk, help me!

99
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,440
Push, Jerzyk!

100
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,726
Push!

101
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,005
Go. Go, go, go.

102
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,121
Oh!

103
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,562
Oh, she's breathing!

104
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,563
Oh! She's breathing!

105
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,091
You beauty!

106
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,527
She's beautiful!

107
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,486
Amazing! Amazing!

108
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,082
That was hard work, wasn't it?

109
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,125
It's all right. It's all right, sweetheart.

110
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,330
You are a, um...

111
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,609
You are a wonder, Punia.
You are Eve in her garden.

112
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,686
It's late. Let's go home.

113
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,240
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

114
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,322
Let's go! We're going.

115
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,881
Mama, what are those men doing?
They look like mules.

116
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,641
We were on Nalewki Street today.

117
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,242
They're working the Jews
like pack animals now.

118
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,166
I think you should take Rys
out of Warsaw tomorrow.

119
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,729
But where will we go?

120
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,200
You could stay with my cousins in Zalesie.

121
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,040
Things are too uncertain here.

122
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,040
We should get Rys
out of the city while we can.

123
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,283
But school's about to start.

124
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,120
Oh, he's so excited, Jan,
with his new pencils, and his shoes...

125
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,330
You're not listening to me.
I'm trying to tell you something.

126
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,600
It's feeling very dangerous to me right now.

127
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,920
What about you?

128
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,761
I have to stay for the animals,
but I'll come as soon as I can.

129
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,960
Punia, Hitler and Stalin have signed a pact.

130
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,724
Only Poland sits in the middle.

131
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,360
People are leaving.

132
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,640
We could stay in Zalesie for a little while,

133
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,520
but if war comes, we have to find
a way out of the country.

134
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,320
I don't want to run away.

135
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,564
I don't want to carry Rys from place
to place, like a frightened cat.

136
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,641
This is his home.

137
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,840
I'm sorry, Punia. Come back to me, come here.

138
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,920
People always want to run when
they don't know what's coming.

139
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,160
It's their first instinct, always to run.

140
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,880
- Come.
- It's not good for a child.

141
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,560
It's not good, Jan, I'm telling you.

142
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,883
I don't want Rys to live that way.

143
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,605
Please, I want to stay here.

144
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,286
In Warsaw.

145
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,081
All right.

146
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,451
Rys? Rys!

147
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,563
Look at all the planes!

148
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,369
Let's go inside.

149
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,169
- But where's Papa?
- He's in Płońsk.

150
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,280
We'll meet him in Zalesie.

151
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,885
What about Pancho?

152
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,200
Quick, pack your things!

153
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,520
- No, Rys, leave him!
- No, I don't want to.

154
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,761
- We'll open the doors.
- He's scared.

155
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,884
He'll run somewhere safe. Let's go!

156
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,086
Mama!

157
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,240
Evacuate the zoo immediately!

158
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,728
This is the Polish Army.
Wild animals are loose.

159
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,960
Emergency! Emergency!

160
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,008
Evacuate now!

161
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,360
Take the boy, Miss, please! Go, go!

162
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,880
No! Don't shoot him, don't shoot him!

163
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,000
No!

164
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,200
No, Mama!

165
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,171
Excuse me, where is the train to Zalesie?

166
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,881
No trains running today!

167
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,166
No trains today!
Leave the station immediately.

168
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,321
Papa!

169
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,080
Antonina!

170
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,400
Rys, Rys, come, come, come.

171
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,641
Papa!

172
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,921
I thought you were lost.

173
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,400
Come, come. Come.

174
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,560
I can't believe you found us.

175
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,563
Let's go home.

176
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,249
Hey. Maybe you'd like to fly. Come.

177
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,651
Come, Punia.

178
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,201
Pancho!

179
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,720
Pancho, I'm here.

180
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,006
It's all right.

181
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,447
He's all right, Mama.

182
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,562
Oh, you poor things.
You must have been so scared.

183
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,769
The German government has taken
charge of the Polish people.

184
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,280
We rely on the population of Warsaw

185
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,200
to accept the entry of German forces

186
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,762
quietly, honorably, and calmly.

187
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,325
They're here, Mama.

188
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,805
Let's go.

189
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,086
They're using our enclosures as an armory.

190
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,482
The country's completely overrun.

191
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,761
I was raised with these people.

192
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,410
Jews, Gentiles.

193
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,644
It didn't matter to my family.
It never mattered to me.

194
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,610
Guten Tag, meine Herren.

195
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,400
Herr Heck.

196
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,280
Thank you, Jerzyk.

197
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,840
Hello.

198
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,285
It's terrible, Frau Zabińska.

199
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,806
Yes. It is.

200
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,480
You know, we weren't expecting you.

201
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,006
I'm so sorry. My husband's not here, so...

202
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,646
Can we talk?

203
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,124
Yes, of course. Please.

204
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,050
Your zoo is to be liquidated.
I'm sorry to tell you.

205
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,283
I don't understand what you mean.

206
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,800
For the war effort.

207
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,531
Meat, firewood,

208
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,409
- soap...
- No.

209
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,364
No. It can't be true.

210
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,361
The animals?

211
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,320
All of them?

212
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,368
Another tragedy, I know.

213
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:23,488
But I see a way out of this, my friend.

214
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,520
That's why I've come.

215
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,920
But you need to listen to me now.
You need to trust me.

216
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,651
Now, I could take your prize animals
to Germany as a loan.

217
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,320
We'll give them sanctuary.

218
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,160
You know you can trust my word on this.

219
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,242
And when the war is over,
I can return them to you.

220
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:44,160
But what if the war comes to Germany?

221
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,160
A terrible thought, I know,
and a personal nightmare for me,

222
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,480
but I must tell you
the Allied forces are very weak.

223
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,403
I expect this to be over very soon.

224
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,680
I want to rescue the best of your breeds.

225
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,360
And I can secure them a future
no matter what might come.

226
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,807
And we can do this together, Frau Zabińska.

227
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,323
We can save your animals together.

228
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,000
What do you think?

229
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,411
Yes.

230
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,169
Of course we must do it.

231
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,840
I'll bring trucks as soon as I can.

232
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,764
Your animals will be fine.
I give you my word.

233
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,811
I don't know how to thank you.

234
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,961
It's from one animal lover to another, hmm?

235
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,566
What do you mean?

236
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,480
Lutz Heck is taking all the animals?

237
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:42,000
No, just the prize stock, for safekeeping.

238
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,120
Ah, but that's our stock, Punia.

239
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,487
That's all that's left to keep
the zoo in operation.

240
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,523
Why didn't he wait to speak to me?

241
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,491
He said he didn't have time.

242
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,487
Jan, he wants to help.

243
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,800
So, I gave him our permission.

244
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,720
He doesn't need our permission, Punia.

245
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,771
Don't you see? He's Hitler's head zoologist.

246
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,769
Lutz Heck controls our zoo.

247
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,440
My God!

248
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,960
- Beautiful.
- Jerzyk, wait. Wait, please.

249
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,249
Stay safe, my beauty.

250
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,562
Put him in Herr Heck's truck.

251
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,881
Come.

252
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,364
Thank you, Jan.

253
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,325
Goodbye, Frau Zabińska.

254
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,160
"The rich shoemaker in the town

255
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,280
"took the measure
of the little foot into his own room

256
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:55,526
"in which stood great glass
cases full of pretty shoes.

257
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,000
"She sat down and made,
well, as well as she could,

258
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,520
"a pair of little..." Ah!

259
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,400
I think Papa's home in time
for New Year's Eve.

260
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,361
Happy New Year, gentlemen.

261
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,040
Is this absolutely necessary?

262
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,121
Yeah.

263
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,080
Stop! What are you doing?

264
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,240
These creatures won't survive the winter.

265
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,971
It's an order from high command.
There's nothing I can do.

266
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,487
No, stop!

267
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,680
Mama! Mama, who's shooting?

268
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,491
Mama, they're shooting! Who's shooting?

269
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,650
Make it stop.

270
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,851
- Tell me, where's the owner?
- He's gone.

271
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,249
Would you tell his wife
I'd like to talk to her?

272
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,925
They left on holiday.

273
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,326
I thought I saw her.
I must have been mistaken.

274
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,887
Have it stuffed and mounted.

275
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,280
Keep moving, children.

276
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,000
- Dr. Korczak.
- That's right.

277
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,650
- Dr. Korczak?
- Not too far now.

278
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,731
Not too far now.

279
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,800
They're forcing Jews out of their homes,

280
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,530
and they are taking us all to the ghetto.

281
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,685
They dragged Maurycy away
like he was a criminal.

282
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,764
That brilliant, kind man,
like he was nothing.

283
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,770
We're going to go where they
want us to go, that's all.

284
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,088
And when the war is over,

285
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,681
we'll come home again.

286
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,600
I've known you since we were boys, Jan.

287
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,923
Go on, Szymon. What do you need from me?

288
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,920
I'd like to keep my insect
collection here with you.

289
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,920
I can't take it with me.

290
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,720
I want it to be safe.
It's my life's work, you know that.

291
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:40,240
Of course, Szymon, yes.
We can put it in the basement.

292
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,802
It's dry there, like a dungeon.
And no one will find it.

293
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:50,002
Thank you, Jan. Thank you.

294
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,242
We have room.

295
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,760
We have the storeroom upstairs.

296
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,366
We could hide Magda there.

297
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,446
Antonina.

298
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,440
This is a human being.

299
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,568
This is a Jew hiding in our house.

300
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,480
We can't even give her a glass of water.

301
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,000
- Do you understand that?
- Mmm.

302
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,004
We could be shot for a glass of water.

303
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,204
So, we just close our eyes and let her go.

304
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,606
Our dearest friend in all the world.

305
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,087
We would have to be sure about this.

306
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,480
Think carefully because...

307
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,609
We'd have to be very sure.

308
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,405
Absolutely no sound during the morning.

309
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,286
No sound, do you understand me?

310
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,720
- The cook leaves at 1:00.
- She'll sleep in the day.

311
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,484
At midnight, the patrol leaves,
and then you can come out.

312
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,170
How long can I stay?

313
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,600
I have nowhere else to go.

314
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,286
You'll stay till it's over.

315
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,281
It's done.

316
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:48,925
They've moved all the Jews behind
walls in the Nalewki District.

317
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,040
And they're bringing in very little food.

318
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:55,442
- Oh, my God.
- And no wood, nothing for the cold.

319
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,200
Have you heard anything about Maurycy?

320
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,720
He's practicing law from a storefront.
That's all I know.

321
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,531
I can't get through the gates, Magda.

322
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,009
No one enters the ghetto without a pass.

323
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,600
Listen,

324
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,880
there are people I know,

325
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,400
people trying to help.

326
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,040
They have trucks, they have guns.

327
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,520
And they want to use
the zoo as a way station.

328
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,045
What do you mean?

329
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:33,562
A place to hide Jews, until safe
houses can be found for them.

330
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,804
A friend is different, one friend.

331
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,440
But more than one? That's dangerous, Jan.
You said it yourself.

332
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,320
They're starving, Antonina.

333
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,970
Two kilometers away.

334
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,564
They are trapped and starving
like rats in a cellar.

335
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,681
How many?

336
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,326
Impossible to say.

337
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,280
And for how long?

338
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,761
They'd be our guests
until we found them refuge.

339
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,205
A human zoo.

340
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:22,760
We have to keep the grounds
in operation, or we're lost.

341
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:27,964
But whatever it is, whatever we do,
we have to hide it in plain sight.

342
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,969
We understand the war office
is going to close our zoo.

343
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:19,210
An unfortunate consequence
of the occupation. I'm really sorry.

344
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,640
Well, of course we want to save it if we can.

345
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,440
We've spent many years building it.

346
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,880
I'm sure you understand.

347
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,600
I do.

348
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,569
What do you propose, Frau Zabińska?

349
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,843
A pig farm, Herr Heck.

350
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,161
A pig farm?

351
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,607
- Is this a joke?
- No.

352
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,529
Your men are hungry.

353
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:49,080
Your officers, they need meat.

354
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:52,160
Uh, we need to keep
the zoo in operation, Lutz.

355
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,720
We'll raise pigs in the pens
to feed your men,

356
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,485
and we will save our zoo.

357
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:04,685
Pigs. Well, they're cheap to farm,
of course, but how would you feed them?

358
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,840
We could collect garbage from the ghetto.

359
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,325
Of course, with your permission.

360
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,480
I certainly see your point.

361
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,006
Your zoo's been of value. That's very true.

362
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:21,326
Your bison was exquisite.
A perfect specimen, and a terrible loss.

363
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,000
I've spoken of it to Hermann Göring,

364
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,280
and I'm happy to say
that he's agreed with me.

365
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,647
I am to start a breeding program this summer.

366
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,360
You're going to breed bison?

367
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:37,651
No, that plan has no scope, no ambition.

368
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,882
No, I intend to breed
aurochsen from the bison.

369
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,045
Aurochsen. But...

370
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,760
But they have been extinct
for 300 years, Lutz.

371
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,560
They're storybook creatures now.

372
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,849
That's exactly the point.
I intend to bring them back.

373
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,166
That's not possible.

374
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,330
I didn't know that you thought
so little of me, Dr. Zabiński.

375
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,280
I devoted my life to the study of genetics,

376
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,960
and I'm well practiced
in the study of animal breeding.

377
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,720
I'm an expert in that field.

378
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,960
And I think I know more than anyone.

379
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,246
Even more than you.

380
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,244
Herr Göring must respect you very much.

381
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,887
Oh, I believe he does, yes.

382
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,890
Well... I think the pigs will work.

383
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,840
I'm sure Göring will be
pleased with the idea.

384
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:47,160
And what an irony,
a trayf farm fed by Jewish garbage.

385
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,164
And right under their noses.

386
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,241
Cheers!

387
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,483
- Hello, Lutz. What's this?
- Jan.

388
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,120
Draw them into the pen, and close the gate!

389
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,567
But be careful, he's in a temper.

390
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,760
You're breeding them here?

391
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,966
They require a natural habitat.

392
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,200
We thought of your zoo,
but we had to fight the war office.

393
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,360
And then you came knocking on my door,
as if you could read my mind.

394
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,360
You paved the way with pigs.

395
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,321
What a crack-brained idea,
and what splendid luck for us!

396
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,527
I'll work with him.

397
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,888
We can keep our eye on him
with the bison here.

398
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,324
Well, he trusts you, that's clear.

399
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,290
You have a way with him.

400
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:10,528
I don't know how I can ask you to do this.

401
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,445
Then don't ask me.

402
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,088
I'm going to do it, that's all.

403
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,170
The feed's ready for the pigs. I have to go.

404
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,726
See you later, darling.

405
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,041
Halt!

406
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,846
It's the pig farmer of Warsaw.

407
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,721
Up! Up!

408
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,480
This looks good.

409
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,441
This is fine.

410
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,761
Zabiński!

411
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,126
Excuse me.

412
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,447
It's pig meat. Put it away.

413
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,880
So, how is Magda? Is she all right?

414
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:15,400
Yes. She worries about you.

415
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,528
What could I do? I had no choice.

416
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,761
You can't hide this face.

417
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,040
Uh... It's...

418
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,407
It's worse than I realized.

419
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:37,440
There's a young girl back there.

420
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,729
It's a... a child.

421
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,724
And two soldiers are with her.

422
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,042
No one is safe.

423
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,840
I don't know what will happen now.

424
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,686
What do they intend to do with us, Jan?

425
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:58,881
Thank you.

426
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:07,886
Thank you.

427
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,680
You must stop now, children.

428
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,923
We need the peelings for our soup.

429
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,240
- Dr. Korczak.
- I'm sorry, we have nothing else to eat.

430
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:27,120
No, no, I should have realized.
Uh, may we speak privately?

431
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,607
- I might be able to help you.
- Yes, of course.

432
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,409
It's pig meat. I'll bring more when I can.

433
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:57,961
I can get you out.

434
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:03,600
People know your books.
They will take care of you.

435
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,800
You should leave with me, Dr. Korczak.

436
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:10,040
But then what of the children?

437
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:12,360
What of them, Dr. Zabiński?

438
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,647
My heart is no different than yours.

439
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,649
I should not be here,
they should not be here,

440
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,889
you should not be here.

441
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,931
Go, go, go.

442
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,165
Cover yourself.

443
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,522
I can help you.
You have to be very, very quiet.

444
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,485
Very quiet.

445
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,280
Here, go in, go, go.

446
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,920
Stay down.

447
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,570
Good girl.

448
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,769
Move over.

449
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,091
Halt!

450
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,769
Stay in, but listen.

451
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,680
We will show you into a tunnel.

452
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:53,807
And you will spend the night there.

453
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,720
The German patrol comes back
shortly after dawn.

454
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,280
But you will be woken before that
and taken outside of Warsaw.

455
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,521
Understand?

456
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,160
Go. Keep your heads down.

457
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:08,400
Hurry. Through the tunnel.

458
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,721
Through the tunnel. Go through the tunnel.

459
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,485
Hello.

460
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,401
Hey.

461
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,842
There's a cook that comes every morning.

462
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,608
Please, you can't make a sound.

463
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,685
Will you tell me your name?

464
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,362
Mine is Antonina.

465
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:18,400
A new hiding place can feel strange.

466
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:23,725
But I promise you,
you're going to be all right.

467
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,202
I'll stay with you if you like.

468
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,288
I'm right here.

469
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,921
Now.

470
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:08,646
Good work, Jan.

471
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,366
- The army's waiting for them in Łomża.
- Good luck.

472
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:41,400
If you tell me your family name,

473
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,608
we can look for them.

474
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,241
Maybe we could bring them here.

475
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:00,448
What a terrible time you must have had.

476
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,007
My father died.

477
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:17,923
He was shot in St. Petersburg.

478
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,161
I was...

479
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,571
Me, I was about your age.

480
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:39,569
We were taken in by friends sometimes,

481
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,731
or by strangers.

482
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,246
We were running for so long.

483
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:01,287
And no one knows how hard it is,

484
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,686
a life in hiding.

485
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:15,643
You can never tell who your enemies are,

486
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,451
or who to trust.

487
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:31,566
Maybe that's why I love animals so much.

488
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,606
You look in their eyes,

489
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:44,084
and you know exactly what's in their hearts.

490
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,770
They're not like people.

491
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,764
We live in a zoo.

492
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:05,646
That's where you are,

493
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:10,806
in a zoo.

494
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,922
Most of the animals are gone now
because of the bombing.

495
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,050
But this one,

496
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:27,567
she was left behind.

497
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,121
Quiet.

498
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
This way.

499
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:44,680
Women and children
will stay here in the basement,

500
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:47,684
until we can find a safe house
that can take you.

501
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,246
We shall be possums now.

502
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,802
We shall sleep in the mornings
when the cook is here.

503
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,402
I will play my piano after midnight,
and then you'll know it's safe to come out.

504
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,970
But if you hear the piano
in the day, you must hide.

505
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:01,560
It's so cold today.

506
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:05,402
Would you please make a double batch of soup?

507
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,520
We'll mate them this summer.

508
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:40,090
- Mmm-hmm.
- She'll be in estrus a short time.

509
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,129
- Yes, a day at most.
- Exactly.

510
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:59,806
Well, I'm afraid I've worn you out
with all our talk.

511
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:04,323
Oh, not at all. I've enjoyed your company.

512
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:06,161
Have you?

513
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:09,886
Still, I think it's time to go.

514
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:03,690
Goodbye, Antonina.

515
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,560
We haven't much time, Mrs. Aszer.

516
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,840
Your friends are waiting for you in Łódź.

517
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,490
Rys, please, bring her upstairs.

518
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:24,322
Goodbye, cousin! Visit us again soon!

519
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:08,769
I always wanted to draw...

520
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,689
...but I was never good at it.

521
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:16,569
I hope someday, you'll teach me?

522
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:25,324
Can we see your rabbit?

523
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:45,846
What is his name?

524
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:55,091
I call him Piotr.

525
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:00,769
It was my brother's name.

526
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:05,443
And what's your name?

527
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:15,165
They called me Urszula.

528
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,570
Urszula means "she-bear."

529
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,247
Did you know that?

530
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,051
Yes.

531
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,004
My father used to say it.

532
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:15,209
Good evening. Hello.

533
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:08,645
It's almost bearable today.

534
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:02,891
Herr Heck, Miss.

535
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:05,361
Oh.

536
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:08,680
What a surprise.
I wasn't expecting you today.

537
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:10,120
A good surprise, I hope.

538
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,720
Of course. Always a good surprise.

539
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:14,440
I have another surprise for you.

540
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:16,887
Our girl is ready. Come.

541
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:32,610
Take the rope, keep her calm.

542
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:34,161
Steady.

543
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:47,084
Now, come on, come on. Come on.

544
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:01,840
That's it.

545
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:07,121
That's it.

546
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:13,570
That's it.

547
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:54,480
Where are your shoes?

548
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:56,920
I must have left them in the pen.

549
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,002
Well, put them on, please.
You're not a child.

550
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,291
Upstairs!

551
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:16,526
Go, go, go!

552
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:33,120
Yes?

553
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,680
- Dr. Zabiński?
- Yes.

554
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:39,924
I'm Dr. Ziegler. I'm the director
of the Ghetto Labor Bureau.

555
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:44,488
I've come to see the bugs.

556
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:49,451
Szymon died, you see.

557
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:53,282
Szymon and I went hunting many times.

558
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:57,440
I'm a bit of a bug man myself.

559
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:00,888
An amateur entomologist, you might say.

560
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:06,726
Wonderful.

561
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,607
What an extraordinary collection.

562
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:14,480
Szymon died of an ulcer.

563
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:18,690
It exploded in his stomach.
He couldn't be saved.

564
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,607
It's such a tragedy for me.

565
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:27,601
I respected him very much indeed.

566
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:34,720
Uh...

567
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:38,964
Szymon told me about you.

568
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:47,366
He...

569
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:53,762
...said some, um...

570
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:57,284
...interesting things.

571
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:14,961
Uh...

572
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:17,011
Listen to me.

573
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:26,484
The ghetto walls were built against
our Labor Bureau building.

574
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:29,920
We have two doors.

575
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,760
One opens into the free side of the city,

576
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:35,320
the other, into the ghetto.

577
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:39,371
In one way, out the other, you understand me?

578
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:41,641
Yes.

579
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:48,727
I will give you papers that will
give you access either way.

580
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:52,040
Dr. Zabiński, welcome to the Labor Office.

581
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:54,200
You can take the workers out,

582
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:56,647
I will see that they are signed back in.

583
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:01,200
This is Dr. Zabiński. He works for me.

584
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,965
You will allow him through
whenever he comes or goes.

585
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:11,561
Look, this is Dr. Zabiński,
he's allowed to pass through every time.

586
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:19,840
Open the gate!

587
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,124
I look forward to working with you.

588
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:47,366
Bring them out. Bring as many as you can.

589
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:08,761
Go.

590
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:23,687
Come.

591
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:44,088
Thank you. Go.

592
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:50,967
Right, right, right, right.

593
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,323
Watch out. Watch out.

594
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:32,848
Goodbye. See you soon.

595
01:13:58,480 --> 01:13:59,481
Who is this?

596
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:03,050
What do you mean? He works for me.
I'm Dr. Jan Zabiński.

597
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:06,847
Yes, but who is he?
I've never seen him before.

598
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:13,600
He is Dr. Kleinhauser.

599
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:15,200
He is with me.

600
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:17,680
Do you want me to go to the Labor Bureau?

601
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:21,287
Do you want me to waste
Dr. Ziegler's time, his valuable time,

602
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:24,280
to have him come all the way here,
to talk to you,

603
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:26,567
to tell you that he is with me?

604
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:28,761
What do you want?

605
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:32,965
I'm sorry, Dr. Zabiński.

606
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:37,891
My apologies, Dr. Kleinhauser.

607
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:44,449
Just keep walking.

608
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:59,449
Magda!

609
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:29,483
You agree to have me here?

610
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:33,689
You will be in great danger.

611
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:07,487
Will you come to bed?

612
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:10,606
I won't sleep.

613
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:15,168
It's all right.

614
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:19,168
Let's just lie together

615
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:24,001
for a little while.

616
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:29,370
Was he here today?

617
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:32,561
Yes.

618
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:40,090
The female's strong.
She'll give birth in spring.

619
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,560
Did he...

620
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:47,725
Did he bathe you, Punia?
Did he wash your hands?

621
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:52,600
No.

622
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:54,523
Jan.

623
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:57,161
Jan.

624
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:01,884
We were nearly caught today.

625
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:32,080
Antonina? What is it?

626
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:34,409
I'm sorry.

627
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:39,924
Don't be silly. What should you be sorry for?

628
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:45,247
I want to do what's right.

629
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:52,247
My heart is filled with it,
my stomach with such loathing.

630
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:58,680
And I don't know what to do.

631
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:02,360
It's a new world, Antonina.

632
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:05,360
Our lives are turned upside down.

633
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:07,568
How can any of us know anything now?

634
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:13,530
Miss, I can't find any jars of beans, or...

635
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:21,600
You must continue to use your ointment,
Mrs. Zabińska, for your hands.

636
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:25,287
Just as I instructed.
Now, I will check your pulse.

637
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:27,161
Thank you, Doctor.

638
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:31,120
- Pietrasia, do you mind?
- No, no, no.

639
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:34,283
I'm sorry, Doctor. I didn't see you come in.

640
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:45,689
You know, we've had to let most
of the zookeepers go.

641
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:49,446
Times are very hard.

642
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:53,083
It's not your fault.

643
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:58,524
You have always been so good to me,
Miss. You and your husband.

644
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:04,010
Now, I'll be good to you.

645
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:09,450
Be careful.

646
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:26,440
Attention. Attention.

647
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:29,842
Tomorrow the evacuation
of the ghetto will begin.

648
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:33,880
Pack your belongings,
and prepare for resettlement.

649
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:21,080
And now, listen to an old story.

650
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:26,160
I wrote it for you. It's a children's tale.

651
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:27,924
- So...
- Dr. Korczak...

652
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,200
Where are they taking you?

653
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:34,400
We are going to a land called Ro,

654
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:36,760
to visit a great magician there.

655
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:41,640
His name is Zi.
He's a very good friend of mine.

656
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:43,920
Yes.

657
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,720
Dr. Korczak, my car is outside the gate.

658
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:50,640
It's just outside, just there.

659
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:53,480
It's impossible.

660
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:58,566
I need your help now,
or the fear will be unmanageable.

661
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:43,280
God bless you, Dr. Zabiński.

662
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:45,283
Goodbye for now.

663
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:53,769
Pray for us.

664
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:39,361
What's this?

665
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:46,162
Look who's joined the party.

666
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:48,051
The pig farmer of Warsaw.

667
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:53,560
What will the pig farmer do now, I wonder.

668
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:56,166
Who knows, Herr Heck?

669
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:00,410
A man might be surprised.

670
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:04,040
He comes here whenever he likes.

671
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:07,124
He touches you however he likes.

672
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:14,000
What would you have me do?
I can't send him away.

673
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:15,840
We have to work with him, we agreed.

674
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:17,760
It was the only way to do this.

675
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:21,083
I never agreed to this. Never.

676
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:23,000
- To what?
- This...

677
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:25,560
This dance you do with him.

678
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:28,960
This fun little game you play.

679
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:33,125
You don't even see it. He frightens me.

680
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:38,520
I am here with a house
full of desperate people,

681
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:42,360
and he comes here and he frightens me,

682
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:44,720
and you're not here.

683
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:47,240
And there's nothing
I can do. You're not here.

684
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:50,802
People are dying, Antonina.

685
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:55,120
Thousands of people are dying.

686
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:59,440
And you are here.
You stay hidden here, safe and sound.

687
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:02,760
You don't know. You don't know.

688
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:06,080
Grandparents, women, children.

689
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:07,605
The littlest of children.

690
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:11,010
And I'm trying to help them,
but they're dying in my hands.

691
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:14,121
And you don't know.

692
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:16,405
You don't know what it's like.

693
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:28,440
And here you are,

694
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:30,090
fooling with that man.

695
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:37,001
Jan, don't you see?

696
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:40,321
He owns us.

697
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:47,290
He owns us now.

698
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:58,524
Antonina. Antonina.

699
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,400
- Mrs. Anzelowna?
- Yes?

700
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:15,925
And your mother?

701
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:20,922
Out. Come out. Out.

702
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:31,203
Here, down on your knees. On your knees.

703
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:33,041
- Down!
- Down!

704
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:46,882
Was it her hair?

705
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:51,727
Was it her hair color?

706
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:53,686
Of course not.

707
01:25:57,160 --> 01:26:01,245
Someone at the boarding house
must have turned them in.

708
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:19,680
On this day, the 19th ofApril, 1943,

709
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:22,400
on the eve of Adolf Hitler's birthday,

710
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:24,680
Reichsführer Heinrich Himmler announced

711
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:27,366
the final extermination of the Warsaw Ghetto.

712
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,640
Rise up, citizens of Warsaw.

713
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:33,520
Join our brothers and sisters in the fight.

714
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:37,480
For on this day,
our ghetto will be liquidated.

715
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:40,245
The Warsaw Ghetto will be no more.

716
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:45,602
Today is April the 19th.
Passover begins tonight.

717
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:54,640
May we have a Seder?

718
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:57,087
Antonina?

719
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:01,531
I know it by heart.

720
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:10,771
It's snowing.

721
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:17,450
What is it?

722
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:00,641
Mama?

723
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:07,205
They're burning the ghetto.

724
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:28,720
Here's cash and papers.
We'll move Mrs. Mayzel to Bramki.

725
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:30,800
They're taking Mrs. Poznanska
to Foksal Street.

726
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:33,406
- Jan...
- Yeah, good.

727
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:44,240
How did you get here?

728
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:45,685
I followed you.

729
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:48,644
You never let me go anywhere.

730
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:50,647
Drive on.

731
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:54,364
- Let me go!
- Be quiet.

732
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:43,524
Burn it down.

733
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:15,207
Where's your mother?

734
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:18,121
She's at the doctor's.

735
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:19,241
Mmm-hmm.

736
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:24,284
And your father?

737
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:28,327
He's in Zalesie, I think.

738
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:31,967
Zalesie?

739
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:36,641
I bet it's cold out there.

740
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:39,642
How long has he been there?

741
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:42,804
A week. I mean, a month.

742
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:45,168
A month? That's a long time.

743
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:50,083
I thought I just saw him the other day.

744
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:55,927
No, I told you. He's in Zalesie.

745
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:03,728
Well, I love Zalesie.

746
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:08,130
I like to swim there, in the lake.
It's beautiful.

747
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:12,840
I bet you wanted to go swimming, too.

748
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:15,800
And that's why you yelled
at your father on Zurawia Street.

749
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:17,160
No.

750
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:18,880
Then why did you yell?

751
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:20,849
I wasn't supposed to leave the zoo.

752
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:33,440
I want to speak to your mother
and your father.

753
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:34,806
Tell them I've come by.

754
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:36,326
Yes.

755
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:38,210
But Papa's in Zalesie.

756
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:43,287
I forgot.

757
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:46,728
Your papa's in Zalesie.

758
01:33:58,160 --> 01:34:01,164
Good boy for reminding me.

759
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:09,324
Your parents must be proud of you.

760
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:12,847
Tell them they should be proud of you.

761
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:19,363
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

762
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:43,486
Hitler ist kaputt!

763
01:34:56,120 --> 01:34:57,724
Stand down.

764
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:17,280
We had a girl, Papa.

765
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:20,011
I've named her Teresa, like the saint.

766
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:25,881
Oh, that's a good name.
That's a beautiful name.

767
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:30,049
Hello, Teresa.

768
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:36,328
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

769
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:41,568
I'm wonderful.

770
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:45,360
This is Warsaw calling.
This is Warsaw calling.

771
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:49,640
August 1st, 1944.

772
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:51,688
This is Warsaw calling.

773
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:56,211
The Polish Home Army
is rising up against the Nazi Reich.

774
01:36:56,560 --> 01:37:00,120
We call on all great citizens of Warsaw

775
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:03,920
to free our city and our nation.

776
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,764
The German Army must not stand.

777
01:37:05,880 --> 01:37:06,960
Follow me.

778
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:10,200
This is Warsaw calling.
This is Warsaw calling.

779
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:14,090
Go!

780
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:38,083
Aim.

781
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:40,045
Shoot.

782
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:49,207
Go.

783
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:52,925
Go, go, go!

784
01:38:11,120 --> 01:38:13,400
I was told that he was shot in the neck.

785
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:16,051
The Germans took him to a prison camp,

786
01:38:16,160 --> 01:38:17,571
but no one knows where he is.

787
01:38:24,160 --> 01:38:25,446
I'm sorry, Miss.

788
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:35,006
This is Warsaw calling.
This is Warsaw calling.

789
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:40,488
Citizens of Warsaw,
we urge you to leave at once.

790
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:43,280
The city is no longer safe foryou.

791
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:46,760
I repeat, you are not safe.

792
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:50,080
We urge you to take only what you can carry.

793
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:52,080
Leave at once.

794
01:38:52,160 --> 01:38:54,760
This is Warsaw calling.

795
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:57,720
The Home Army is overrun.

796
01:38:57,800 --> 01:38:59,760
The Russian offensive has begun,

797
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:02,571
and the German Army is expected to fall.

798
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:07,206
You are not safe. This is Warsaw calling...

799
01:39:14,360 --> 01:39:16,249
Herr Heck's taking the bison out of Warsaw.

800
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:22,000
Miss, you're not leaving the zoo.

801
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:24,640
I have to know what happened to Jan.

802
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:26,722
- Miss...
- I have to know.

803
01:40:25,120 --> 01:40:26,326
You've packed your things.

804
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:31,401
The war's turning.
I've been ordered back to Berlin.

805
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:37,282
What bad luck for us.

806
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:41,045
We'll be sorry to see you go.

807
01:40:47,120 --> 01:40:50,880
I'm here to ask you, my friend,

808
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:52,610
I'm looking for my husband.

809
01:40:54,920 --> 01:40:56,809
He was captured by German troops.

810
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:58,691
He was taken from the zoo?

811
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:00,360
No. From Old Town.

812
01:41:00,440 --> 01:41:02,400
The underground army's
fighting in the Old Town.

813
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:03,880
What was Jan doing there?

814
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:05,450
Buying grass for the bison.

815
01:41:08,840 --> 01:41:09,841
What did you say?

816
01:41:11,160 --> 01:41:13,527
Jan was buying grass and he was captured.

817
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:25,044
Why are you really here, Antonina?

818
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,446
I hoped you might help me find him.

819
01:41:31,320 --> 01:41:33,527
As a gift to our friendship.

820
01:41:35,720 --> 01:41:37,768
He might be dead.

821
01:41:38,600 --> 01:41:40,523
He might be.

822
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:44,284
I don't know. I don't know anything.

823
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:51,763
And what gift would I receive in return?

824
01:41:52,520 --> 01:41:54,488
I'm curious to know.

825
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:46,481
Has Jan been keeping secrets from me?

826
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:48,966
No, of course not.

827
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:50,931
Are you lying to me, Antonina?

828
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:53,647
No.

829
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:59,320
I just want to find
what happened to my husband.

830
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:01,522
And if he's dead, I want to bury him.

831
01:43:01,640 --> 01:43:04,769
"Hitler ist kaputt!" I heard your son say it.

832
01:43:05,080 --> 01:43:08,000
He's a child, Lutz.

833
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:10,400
It means nothing to him, it's a game.

834
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:12,160
He hears things
and he repeats them, that's all...

835
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:13,287
Where does he hear them?

836
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:15,881
Um...

837
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:18,649
I don't know.

838
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:20,808
- People come and go all the time...
- Who comes and goes?

839
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:25,643
Soldiers and guards and...

840
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:27,840
Believe me, it means nothing to him.

841
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:29,200
Did he hear it from his father? Did he?

842
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:30,566
No.

843
01:43:32,680 --> 01:43:33,681
No.

844
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:46,040
You're lying to me, Antonina.

845
01:43:46,120 --> 01:43:47,560
I can see it in your eyes.

846
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:48,880
No.

847
01:43:56,600 --> 01:43:58,443
No!

848
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:02,931
No, Lutz! No!

849
01:44:15,240 --> 01:44:16,844
Look at me.

850
01:44:19,160 --> 01:44:20,924
Look at me.

851
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:29,127
You disgust me.

852
01:44:50,120 --> 01:44:52,521
So, that's how it is.

853
01:44:54,440 --> 01:44:57,205
You hid it well.

854
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:09,881
But I wonder

855
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:13,603
what else have you been hiding from me?

856
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:19,441
What have you been up to,
Frau Zabińska, in your little zoo?

857
01:45:44,520 --> 01:45:46,602
Excuse me, please!

858
01:45:49,560 --> 01:45:50,561
Jerzyk!

859
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:58,005
We have to get them out. Herr Heck is coming.

860
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:00,245
The bombing is coming in.

861
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:02,403
Herr Heck wants you out.

862
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:21,841
Everyone!

863
01:46:23,640 --> 01:46:26,962
Pack your things. They're coming!
Hurry, they're coming!

864
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:30,648
Go! Go!

865
01:46:51,480 --> 01:46:52,560
Go to the truck.

866
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:54,244
- Yeah, go quickly.
- Go to the truck.

867
01:46:54,680 --> 01:46:56,489
Quickly, please, go. You must hurry!

868
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:00,286
Go. Go.

869
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:10,363
Come back when the war's over, promise me.

870
01:47:11,120 --> 01:47:13,805
She's coming with us! Go quickly, boys!

871
01:47:13,960 --> 01:47:15,600
- Rys, get in the truck.
- No, I'm not going.

872
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:18,206
- Rys!
- No!

873
01:47:19,320 --> 01:47:21,288
Take Teresa, we'll catch up to you.

874
01:47:22,680 --> 01:47:23,840
Promise me you'll hurry.

875
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:25,684
Yes, please, go! I'll find you, quick!

876
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:46,730
Go downstairs, hide. Don't make a sound.

877
01:48:01,240 --> 01:48:03,480
Search the grounds.

878
01:50:57,080 --> 01:50:59,240
Hey!

879
01:51:09,120 --> 01:51:10,121
Stop!

880
01:51:21,480 --> 01:51:24,370
- Stop!
- Lutz.

881
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:26,770
Drop your weapon!

882
01:51:27,560 --> 01:51:29,164
I said, drop your weapon now.

883
01:51:29,320 --> 01:51:30,446
Please.

884
01:51:33,160 --> 01:51:36,040
Don't.

885
01:51:36,120 --> 01:51:38,566
How many?

886
01:51:38,760 --> 01:51:41,604
How many did you hide?

887
01:51:43,200 --> 01:51:44,611
I don't know the number.

888
01:51:49,680 --> 01:51:52,365
Lock her in. Lock her in!

889
01:51:55,440 --> 01:51:57,010
Do it, Rys.

890
01:51:58,720 --> 01:52:02,167
Do what he says. Do exactly what he says.

891
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:07,280
Come on!

892
01:52:07,360 --> 01:52:10,960
What kind of man shoots an innocent child?

893
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:12,360
You have no idea what kind of man I am.

894
01:52:12,440 --> 01:52:13,487
Oh, but I do.

895
01:52:14,200 --> 01:52:15,611
I do, Lutz.

896
01:52:15,800 --> 01:52:18,760
You are a serious man.

897
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:22,561
You're a man of intelligence and of breeding.

898
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:26,600
Not the kind of man that would shoot a child.

899
01:52:26,680 --> 01:52:28,160
Mama!

900
01:52:28,240 --> 01:52:31,483
No, Lutz! No!

901
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:34,850
Ah! No!

902
01:52:47,960 --> 01:52:49,689
Rys.

903
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:08,841
Mama.

904
01:53:13,200 --> 01:53:17,000
Mama. Don't cry, Mama.

905
01:53:18,680 --> 01:53:19,727
Don't cry.

906
01:53:21,560 --> 01:53:22,561
I'm here.

907
01:53:24,680 --> 01:53:26,284
I'm here.

908
01:53:28,440 --> 01:53:32,365
I don't think I can walk.
Can you help me, sweetheart?

909
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:36,241
- Hey!
- Jerzyk!

910
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:40,840
Hey.

911
01:56:40,920 --> 01:56:42,081
You're here.

912
01:56:44,920 --> 01:56:48,083
It's my home, son, hmm?
Where else would I go?

913
01:56:54,280 --> 01:56:55,770
You're home, hmm?

914
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:25,124
Rys, look.

915
01:58:26,520 --> 01:58:29,763
Look. It's a strawberry.

916
01:59:24,680 --> 01:59:26,569
Jan!

917
01:59:26,920 --> 01:59:28,888
Jan!

917
01:59:29,305 --> 02:00:29,407
