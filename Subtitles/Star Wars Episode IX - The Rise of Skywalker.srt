2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

3
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,736
At last.

4
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:11,415
Snoke trained you well.

5
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,251
I killed Snoke.

6
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,186
I'll kill you.

7
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,090
My boy.

8
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:20,827
I made Snoke.

9
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,697
I have been every voice...

10
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,497
you have ever heard...

11
00:04:27,499 --> 00:04:29,903
<i>inside your head.</i>

12
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,920
The First Order
was just the beginning.

13
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:53,490
I will give you
so much more.

14
00:04:53,492 --> 00:04:55,226
You'll die first.

15
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:57,864
I have died before.

16
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:02,499
The dark side of the Force
is a pathway...

17
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:06,773
to many abilities
some consider to be...

18
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,442
unnatural.

19
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:21,922
What could you give me?

20
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:24,658
Everything.

21
00:05:27,426 --> 00:05:30,529
A new Empire.

22
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:58,923
<i>The might of the Final Order
will soon be ready.</i>

23
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:03,163
<i>It will be yours
if you do as I ask.</i>

24
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:07,065
Kill the girl!

25
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:08,833
End the Jedi...

26
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:13,206
and become what your
grandfather Vader could not.

27
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:20,211
You will rule
all the galaxy...

28
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,016
as the new emperor.

29
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,550
But beware...

30
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,788
she is not
who you think she is.

31
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:34,359
Who is she?

32
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,185
Are you ever gonna go?

33
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,655
- He can't beat us every time.
- Apparently he does.

34
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:05,923
How does he do it?

35
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,125
This guy right here?
It's 'cause he cheats.

36
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:08,993
I'm kidding!

37
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,328
- Oh, come on. Take your turn.
- You're 250 years old.

38
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,763
You're taking forever.
That's cheating.

39
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,064
Of course
you're better than us.

40
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:14,165
That's why we think
you're cheating.

41
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,336
- Don't worry!
- We're not gonna turn it off.

42
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,307
- He's cheating.
- Definitely.

43
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:24,675
Klaud, I hope
you fixed that surge.

44
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:33,583
T-minus five.

45
00:07:33,585 --> 00:07:34,854
Artoo.

46
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,001
Boolio, good to see you.
You got something for us?

47
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:53,006
From a new ally!
A spy in the First Order!

48
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:56,140
A spy? Who?

49
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,375
I don't know!

50
00:07:57,377 --> 00:08:00,579
Transfer the message!
Get it to Leia, hurry!

51
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:04,382
This could be big, Artoo.

52
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:16,627
<i>Locked on target.</i>

53
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,362
Finn, we're about
to be cooked!

54
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:19,630
We're almost there!

55
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:22,600
Poe, we got it.

56
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:24,068
How do we thank you?

57
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,839
Win the war!

58
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:34,714
Sorry, I'm sorry! I know!

59
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:46,192
Finn, you're supposed to be
getting rid of those things!

60
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:48,228
Ooh!

61
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:51,562
- I got one!
- How many are left?

62
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:52,763
Too many.

63
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,832
What?

64
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,071
Good thinking, Chewie.

65
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:01,739
Finn, we can boulder
these TIEs!

66
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,309
I was just thinking that.

67
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,321
Ha!

68
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:19,390
<i>Get us back to base!</i>

69
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,125
How thick do you think
that ice wall is?

70
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,273
- Poe!
- I know, I know!

71
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:38,676
What are you doing?

72
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,411
Lightspeed skipping.

73
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,115
How do you know
how to do that?

74
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:49,954
Yeah, well,
Rey's not here, is she?

75
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,664
Last jump, maybe forever.

76
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,800
Hold on!

77
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,049
Be with me.

78
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:20,820
Be with me.

79
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,724
Be with me.

80
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,895
They're not with me. Ugh.

81
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,367
Rey.

82
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:37,636
Be patient.

83
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:39,370
I'm starting to
think it isn't possible...

84
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:41,939
to hear voices of the Jedi
who came before.

85
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:43,874
Nothing's impossible.

86
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:45,309
Nothing's impossible.

87
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,146
I'm gonna run
the training course.

88
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:25,009
<i>No!</i>

89
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:26,077
Join me.

90
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,878
<i>Join me.</i>

91
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,513
<i>Ben, no!</i>

92
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:30,581
<i>You killed him!</i>

93
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,085
Ben!

94
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,899
BB-8,
I'm so sorry.

95
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,671
I didn't finish
the training course.

96
00:12:52,673 --> 00:12:54,173
Got distracted.

97
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:01,847
I'm just
not feeling myself.

98
00:13:01,849 --> 00:13:04,048
I know it looks...

99
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,217
It looks like
I'm making excuses.

100
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:07,853
Don't tell me
what things look like.

101
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:09,222
Tell me what they are.

102
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:13,993
I think I'm just tired.
That's all.

103
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:16,762
General...

104
00:13:16,764 --> 00:13:18,929
the <i>Falcon</i>
still hasn't arrived.

105
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,601
Commander's asking
for guidance.

106
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,971
I will earn
your brother's saber...

107
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,341
one day.

108
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:33,477
No, you can't do it for me.

109
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,048
Never underestimate
a droid.

110
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:40,052
Yes, Master.

111
00:13:48,796 --> 00:13:50,561
Rey!

112
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:51,998
<i>Falcon's</i> back!

113
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:55,266
Come on, get over here!

114
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:56,701
I need a fire crew here!

115
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:59,069
And another one in the back!
Go, go!

116
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:00,938
Coming!

117
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,006
It's on fire!

118
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:04,910
Whole thing's on fire.
All of it.

119
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:06,177
- It's on fire.
- Hey.

120
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,545
- Hey!
- There's a spy?

121
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:09,614
Really could have used
your help out there.

122
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:10,548
How'd it go?

123
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,383
Really bad, actually.
Really bad.

124
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,385
- Han's ship...
- What'd you do to the droid?

125
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:15,821
What'd you do
to the <i>Falcon?</i>

126
00:14:15,823 --> 00:14:17,321
The <i>Falcon</i> in
a lot better shape than he is.

127
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:18,556
BB-8's not on fire.

128
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:20,191
What's left of him
isn't on fire.

129
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,492
- Tell me what happened.
- You tell me first.

130
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:22,993
- You know what you are?
- What?

131
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:24,428
You're difficult.
Really difficult.

132
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,864
- You're a difficult man.
- You, you are...

133
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:27,565
- Rey.
- Finn. Oh.

134
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:29,099
You made it back.

135
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:30,468
Yeah. Barely.

136
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,637
- So, bad mood?
- Me?

137
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,207
- Him.
- Always.

138
00:14:34,842 --> 00:14:36,106
Do we have a spy?

139
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:37,975
Well...

140
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,477
You lightspeed skipped?

141
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:40,712
Yeah, well, it got us
back here, didn't it?

142
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,146
Poe, the compressor's down.

143
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:43,547
- Oh, I know, I was there.
- Every time.

144
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,850
You can't lightspeed skip
the <i>Falcon!</i>

145
00:14:44,852 --> 00:14:46,183
Actually,
it turns out you can.

146
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:47,886
All right, guys,
we just landed, okay?

147
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,119
What happened?

148
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:50,020
Bad news,
that's what happened.

149
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:51,055
No spy?

150
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,256
No. Spy.

151
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:53,658
Did we make contact
with a spy or not?

152
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,926
There's a mole
in the First Order,

153
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:56,060
and they sent us a message.

154
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,294
You dropped a tree on him?

155
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:58,395
You blew
both sub-alternators?

156
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,664
Well,
you know what...

157
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,098
maybe you should've been
out there with us!

158
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,032
You know I wanna be
out there with you.

159
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,267
Yeah, but you're not.

160
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:04,936
You're here training.
For what?

161
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:06,539
You're the best fighter
we have.

162
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,372
We need you.

163
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:10,140
Out there, not here.

164
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:11,575
Junior...

165
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,844
get Artoo
into reconditioning.

166
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:14,046
It's true.

167
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,449
What's the message?

168
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:21,185
We've decoded the intel
from the First Order spy...

169
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:23,122
and it confirms the worst.

170
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:27,024
Somehow,
Palpatine returned.

171
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:33,798
Wait.
Do we believe this?

172
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,232
It cannot be.

173
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,367
The Emperor is dead.

174
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:39,336
Dark science.
Cloning.

175
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:40,739
Secrets only the Sith knew.

176
00:15:40,741 --> 00:15:42,774
He's been planning
his revenge.

177
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:46,510
His followers have been
building something for years.

178
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:49,215
The largest fleet
the galaxy has ever known.

179
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:52,784
He calls it
the Final Order.

180
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:56,621
In 16 hours, attacks
on all free worlds begin.

181
00:15:57,691 --> 00:15:59,156
The Emperor and his fleet
have been hiding

182
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:00,493
in the Unknown Regions.

183
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:02,729
On a world called Exegol.

184
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:09,500
Exegol does not appear
on any star chart.

185
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:14,104
But legend describes it as
the hidden world of the Sith.

186
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:15,607
There were always whispers

187
00:16:15,609 --> 00:16:18,275
of his hunger to cheat death.

188
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,679
So, Palpatine's been
out there all this time.

189
00:16:20,681 --> 00:16:22,212
Pulling the strings.

190
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:24,883
Always. In the shadows.
From the very beginning.

191
00:16:24,885 --> 00:16:28,421
If we want to stop him,
we must find him.

192
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:31,155
Must find Exegol.

193
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,558
General?

194
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,027
Can I speak with you?

195
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:37,629
I know how to get
to Exegol.

196
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,798
- Tell me.
- Luke searched for it.

197
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,366
For a long time.
He nearly found it.

198
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,703
There are ciphers here
I can't read.

199
00:16:44,705 --> 00:16:47,438
But he said to get there,
you need one of these.

200
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,406
A Sith wayfinder.

201
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:52,409
They're compasses
that lead the way to Exegol.

202
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:55,145
To stop what we both know
is coming...

203
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:57,249
I need to finish
what Luke started.

204
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,684
Find Exegol.

205
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:00,919
Find the Emperor.

206
00:17:00,921 --> 00:17:03,420
No.

207
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,759
I don't want to go without
your blessing, but I will.

208
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:09,562
I will.

209
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:12,531
It's what you would do.

210
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,332
So, you got her
up and running?

211
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:16,901
You were right before.

212
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:19,203
I'm gonna pick up
Luke's search for Exegol.

213
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,405
I'm gonna start
where his trail went cold.

214
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,340
The Forbidden Desert
of Pasaana.

215
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,677
Yeah, I know.
We're going with you.

216
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,646
Chewie, you get
that compressor fixed?

217
00:17:27,648 --> 00:17:29,580
I need to go alone.

218
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:30,915
Yeah. Alone with friends.

219
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:32,251
It's too dangerous, Finn.

220
00:17:32,953 --> 00:17:34,052
We go together.

221
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:39,926
I wholeheartedly agree.

222
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:47,297
Rose, last chance.

223
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:49,266
The General asked me to study
the specs of old Destroyers.

224
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,669
So we can stop the fleet
if you find it.

225
00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:51,535
"If"?

226
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,607
When.

227
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:55,742
When.

228
00:18:04,618 --> 00:18:06,185
Hey, we should get going.

229
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:09,555
What is it?

230
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,189
Nothing.

231
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,959
In the event
that I do not return...

232
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:16,326
I want you to know

233
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:18,699
that you have been
a real friend, Artoo.

234
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,367
My best one, in fact.

235
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:29,208
There's so much
I want to tell you.

236
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:32,746
Tell me when you get back.

237
00:18:54,034 --> 00:18:55,767
Rey...

238
00:18:55,769 --> 00:18:58,839
never be afraid
of who you are.

239
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,560
It is.

240
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,209
<i>Knights of Ren.</i>

241
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:12,411
<i>Ghouls.</i>

242
00:20:16,116 --> 00:20:18,616
<i>We have a spy
in our ranks...</i>

243
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:21,719
<i>who just sent a message
to the Resistance.</i>

244
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,891
<i>Whoever this traitor is
won't stop us.</i>

245
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,660
<i>With what I've seen
on Exegol...</i>

246
00:20:28,662 --> 00:20:31,731
<i>the First Order is about to
become a true Empire.</i>

247
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:39,538
<i>I sense unease about
my appearance, General Hux.</i>

248
00:20:42,976 --> 00:20:44,408
About the mask?

249
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,911
No, sir. Well done.

250
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,079
I like it.

251
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:52,382
Forgive me, sir,
but these allies on Exegol...

252
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:53,584
they sound like a cult.

253
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,620
Conjurers
and soothsayers.

254
00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:57,889
They've conjured
legions of Star Destroyers.

255
00:20:57,891 --> 00:21:00,225
The Sith fleet
will increase our resources

256
00:21:00,227 --> 00:21:01,926
ten-thousandfold.

257
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:04,262
Such range and power
will correct the error

258
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:05,897
of Starkiller Base.

259
00:21:05,899 --> 00:21:07,699
We'll need
to increase recruitments.

260
00:21:07,701 --> 00:21:09,701
Harvest more of
the galaxy's young.

261
00:21:09,703 --> 00:21:11,936
This fleet,
what is it, a gift?

262
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:14,373
What is he asking for
in return?

263
00:21:16,977 --> 00:21:20,612
<i>Prepare to crush
any worlds that defy us.</i>

264
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:22,347
<i>My knights and I
are going hunting</i>

265
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:23,984
<i>for the scavenger.</i>

266
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:34,959
You sure
this is it?

267
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,761
These are
the exact coordinates

268
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:38,131
that Master Luke
left behind.

269
00:21:44,738 --> 00:21:46,337
What is this?

270
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:49,173
The Acky Acky
Festival of the Ancestors.

271
00:21:49,175 --> 00:21:53,044
This celebration occurs
only once every 42 years.

272
00:21:53,046 --> 00:21:53,912
Well, that's lucky.

273
00:21:53,914 --> 00:21:55,680
Lucky indeed.

274
00:21:55,682 --> 00:21:58,283
This festival is known
for both its colorful kites...

275
00:21:58,285 --> 00:22:00,552
and its delectable sweets.

276
00:22:21,775 --> 00:22:23,942
I've never seen
anything like this.

277
00:22:23,944 --> 00:22:25,810
I've never seen
so few wayfinders.

278
00:22:25,812 --> 00:22:27,779
There's always random
First Order patrols

279
00:22:27,781 --> 00:22:29,347
in crowds like these.

280
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:30,782
So, keep your heads
down.

281
00:22:30,784 --> 00:22:31,916
Chewie.

282
00:22:37,157 --> 00:22:39,857
Let's split up.
See what the locals know.

283
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,546
She is saying,
"Welcome."

284
00:23:11,191 --> 00:23:13,725
Her name is Nambi Ghima.

285
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:16,526
That's an excellent name.
I'm Rey.

286
00:23:18,198 --> 00:23:21,101
She would be honored
to know your family name, too.

287
00:23:24,204 --> 00:23:25,703
I don't have one.

288
00:23:25,705 --> 00:23:27,107
I'm just Rey.

289
00:23:46,726 --> 00:23:49,162
<i>Palpatine wants you dead.</i>

290
00:23:50,463 --> 00:23:53,133
- Serving another master?
- <i>No.</i>

291
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:56,267
<i>I have other plans.</i>

292
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:59,203
<i>I offered you
my hand once.</i>

293
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:00,907
<i>You wanted to take it.</i>

294
00:24:02,242 --> 00:24:03,243
<i>Why didn't you?</i>

295
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:06,377
You could've killed me.

296
00:24:06,379 --> 00:24:07,881
Why didn't you?

297
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:11,215
<i>You can't hide, Rey.</i>

298
00:24:11,217 --> 00:24:12,285
<i>Not from me.</i>

299
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:16,521
I see through the cracks
in your mask.

300
00:24:16,523 --> 00:24:18,056
You're haunted.

301
00:24:18,058 --> 00:24:22,226
You can't stop seeing
what you did to your father.

302
00:24:22,228 --> 00:24:23,628
<i>Do you still
count the days</i>

303
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,165
<i>since your parents left?</i>

304
00:24:26,266 --> 00:24:30,268
<i>Such pain in you,
such anger.</i>

305
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,205
<i>I don't wanna
have to kill you.</i>

306
00:24:33,406 --> 00:24:34,705
<i>I'm going to find you</i>

307
00:24:34,707 --> 00:24:36,643
<i>and I'm going to turn you
to the dark side.</i>

308
00:24:38,011 --> 00:24:40,246
<i>When I offer you
my hand again...</i>

309
00:24:41,214 --> 00:24:42,215
<i>you'll take it.</i>

310
00:24:44,184 --> 00:24:45,185
We'll see.

311
00:24:51,357 --> 00:24:52,690
Has he seen him?

312
00:24:52,692 --> 00:24:54,826
We have to go.
Back to the <i>Falcon.</i> Now.

313
00:24:54,828 --> 00:24:56,696
- Why?
- It's Ren.

314
00:24:58,765 --> 00:25:00,398
Sir,
we've had this analyzed.

315
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,033
It comes
from the Middian System,

316
00:25:02,035 --> 00:25:03,468
Pasaana, Forbidden Valley.

317
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,836
<i>Prepare my ship.</i>

318
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:06,938
<i>Alert the local troops.
Send a division.</i>

319
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,309
Yes, Supreme Leader.

320
00:25:12,078 --> 00:25:13,478
<i>Freeze.</i>

321
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,679
<i>Hold it right there.</i>

322
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:16,447
<i>I've located
the Resistance fugitives.</i>

323
00:25:16,449 --> 00:25:17,548
<i>All units, report...</i>

324
00:25:23,323 --> 00:25:24,657
<i>Follow me.</i>

325
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:34,134
<i>Hurry.</i>

326
00:25:35,802 --> 00:25:38,236
<i>Leia sent me
a transmission.</i>

327
00:25:38,238 --> 00:25:40,905
Okay.

328
00:25:40,907 --> 00:25:42,742
How'd you find us?

329
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:46,444
Wookiees
stand out in a crowd.

330
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:52,750
It's good to see you too,
old buddy.

331
00:25:52,752 --> 00:25:54,852
This is
General Lando Calrissian.

332
00:25:54,854 --> 00:25:55,920
We know who he is,
Threepio.

333
00:25:55,922 --> 00:25:58,122
It is an honor, General.

334
00:25:58,124 --> 00:26:00,827
General Calrissian,
we're looking for Exegol.

335
00:26:03,363 --> 00:26:04,931
Of course you are.

336
00:26:07,534 --> 00:26:08,933
Only two were made.

337
00:26:08,935 --> 00:26:11,068
A Sith wayfinder.

338
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,970
Luke Skywalker came here
to find one.

339
00:26:12,972 --> 00:26:15,873
I know.
I was with him.

340
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:18,211
Luke and I were tailing
an old Jedi hunter.

341
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:21,012
Ochi of Bestoon.

342
00:26:21,014 --> 00:26:22,246
He was carrying a clue

343
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:24,849
that could lead
to a wayfinder.

344
00:26:24,851 --> 00:26:27,818
We followed his ship halfway
across the galaxy here.

345
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,054
When we got to his ship,
it was abandoned...

346
00:26:30,056 --> 00:26:33,057
No clue. No wayfinder.

347
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:34,325
Is Ochi's ship still here?

348
00:26:34,327 --> 00:26:36,227
It's out in the desert,
where he left it.

349
00:26:36,229 --> 00:26:38,529
We need to get to that ship.
Search it again.

350
00:26:47,073 --> 00:26:49,473
I got a bad feeling
about this.

351
00:26:49,475 --> 00:26:52,009
Ochi's ship
is out past Lurch Canyon.

352
00:26:52,011 --> 00:26:54,278
- Go.
- Thank you, General.

353
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,414
You too, Chewie.

354
00:26:56,416 --> 00:26:58,149
Leia needs pilots, General.

355
00:26:58,151 --> 00:27:01,285
My flying days are long gone.

356
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:02,889
But do me a favor...

357
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:06,023
give Leia my love.

358
00:27:06,025 --> 00:27:08,559
You should
give it to her yourself.

359
00:27:08,561 --> 00:27:09,829
Thank you.

360
00:27:17,737 --> 00:27:19,339
There!
Those speeders.

361
00:27:29,683 --> 00:27:31,249
How do you know
how to do that?

362
00:27:31,251 --> 00:27:32,984
No need to worry.
I made it.

363
00:27:35,755 --> 00:27:37,056
We gotta go.

364
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:44,430
<i>We've spotted the fugitives.</i>

365
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:06,450
Oh! They fly now!

366
00:28:06,452 --> 00:28:07,887
They fly now?

367
00:28:08,488 --> 00:28:09,489
They fly now.

368
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:35,079
Did we lose them?

369
00:28:35,081 --> 00:28:36,816
- Looks like it!
- Excellent job, sir!

370
00:28:39,986 --> 00:28:41,354
Terrible job, sir!

371
00:28:46,459 --> 00:28:47,960
Not now, BB-8.

372
00:29:00,708 --> 00:29:03,009
Never underestimate a droid.

373
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,030
Poe!

374
00:29:28,368 --> 00:29:29,900
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

375
00:29:29,902 --> 00:29:31,270
Right, ho!

376
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:46,486
Ochi's ship.

377
00:29:47,788 --> 00:29:49,487
I've seen that ship before.

378
00:29:49,489 --> 00:29:50,622
Rey!

379
00:29:50,624 --> 00:29:51,924
You get all
of them?

380
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,680
What the hell is this?

381
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,483
Sinking fields!
Try to grab something!

382
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:22,586
Will this agony ever end?

383
00:30:22,588 --> 00:30:23,622
Come on!

384
00:30:23,624 --> 00:30:25,657
BB-8! No!

385
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:26,725
Rey.

386
00:30:26,727 --> 00:30:28,125
Rey, I never told you...

387
00:30:28,127 --> 00:30:30,029
What? Finn!

388
00:30:42,776 --> 00:30:43,974
General.

389
00:30:43,976 --> 00:30:45,042
We're getting reports
of a raid

390
00:30:45,044 --> 00:30:46,477
at the Festival
of Ancestors.

391
00:30:46,479 --> 00:30:49,079
This mission is everything.
We cannot fail.

392
00:30:49,081 --> 00:30:50,916
Any word from Rey?

393
00:30:50,918 --> 00:30:52,884
<i>Falcon's</i> not responding.

394
00:30:52,886 --> 00:30:54,385
Do you have to say it
like that?

395
00:30:54,387 --> 00:30:55,519
Like what?

396
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:58,055
Do me a personal favor?
Be optimistic.

397
00:30:58,057 --> 00:30:59,290
Yes, ma'am.

398
00:30:59,292 --> 00:31:01,325
Uh, this is...
This is terrific.

399
00:31:01,327 --> 00:31:03,127
You're not gonna believe how
well this is gonna turn out.

400
00:31:03,129 --> 00:31:05,463
It's gonna be great.

401
00:31:13,005 --> 00:31:14,739
Rey! Finn!

402
00:31:14,741 --> 00:31:16,942
You didn't say my
name, sir, but I'm all right.

403
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:24,482
- You all right?
- Yeah.

404
00:31:24,484 --> 00:31:25,549
Where's Finn?

405
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:26,618
Where's Chewie?

406
00:31:28,622 --> 00:31:29,487
I'm good.

407
00:31:29,489 --> 00:31:31,021
Ah.
Master Finn.

408
00:31:31,023 --> 00:31:32,389
What is this place?

409
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:33,892
This isn't
the afterlife, is it?

410
00:31:33,894 --> 00:31:35,025
Are droids allowed here?

411
00:31:35,027 --> 00:31:36,093
I thought
we were goners.

412
00:31:36,095 --> 00:31:37,528
We might still be.

413
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:39,065
Which way out?

414
00:31:45,071 --> 00:31:47,104
We have to hurry.

415
00:31:47,106 --> 00:31:48,707
- So, what was it?
- What?

416
00:31:48,709 --> 00:31:50,742
- What you were gonna tell me?
- When?

417
00:31:50,744 --> 00:31:52,309
When you were sinking
in the sand, you said...

418
00:31:52,311 --> 00:31:54,013
"I never told you..."

419
00:31:54,948 --> 00:31:56,080
I'll tell you later.

420
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:58,015
You mean
when Poe's not here?

421
00:31:58,017 --> 00:31:59,250
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

422
00:31:59,252 --> 00:32:00,317
We're gonna die
in sand burrows

423
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:01,485
and we're all
keeping secrets?

424
00:32:01,487 --> 00:32:02,787
I'll tell you
when you tell us

425
00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:04,088
about all that shifty stuff
you do.

426
00:32:05,458 --> 00:32:07,358
I do not wanna know
what made these tunnels.

427
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,760
Judging by
the circumference

428
00:32:08,762 --> 00:32:09,928
of the tunnel walls...

429
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:11,562
I said
I do not wanna know.

430
00:32:11,564 --> 00:32:12,864
Not.

431
00:32:12,866 --> 00:32:14,064
What's that?

432
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:15,232
- Is that a speeder?
- What?

433
00:32:15,234 --> 00:32:16,567
An old one.

434
00:32:16,569 --> 00:32:18,469
Perhaps we will
find the driver.

435
00:32:18,471 --> 00:32:20,972
Yep, BB-8, I think dead, too.

436
00:32:20,974 --> 00:32:23,507
Oh, my.
A hex charm.

437
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:24,575
A what?

438
00:32:24,577 --> 00:32:26,912
A common emblem
of Sith loyalists.

439
00:32:26,914 --> 00:32:28,078
Sith.

440
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,380
This was Ochi's?

441
00:32:29,382 --> 00:32:32,751
Luke sensed it.
Ochi never left this place.

442
00:32:32,753 --> 00:32:34,184
And he ended up
down here.

443
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:35,586
He was headed
for his ship.

444
00:32:35,588 --> 00:32:37,221
Same thing happened to us,
happened to him.

445
00:32:37,223 --> 00:32:38,723
So, how did
Ochi get out?

446
00:32:38,725 --> 00:32:39,726
He didn't.

447
00:32:44,096 --> 00:32:45,429
No, he didn't.

448
00:32:45,431 --> 00:32:46,831
Bones.

449
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:48,265
I don't like bones.

450
00:32:48,267 --> 00:32:50,637
Bones?
Never a good sign.

451
00:32:52,706 --> 00:32:54,106
Yeah, I see it.

452
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:08,920
Horrible things...

453
00:33:08,922 --> 00:33:10,154
have happened with this.

454
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:11,923
There's writing on it.

455
00:33:11,925 --> 00:33:14,291
Perhaps I can translate.

456
00:33:14,293 --> 00:33:17,261
Oh. The location
of the wayfinder,

457
00:33:17,263 --> 00:33:19,496
has been inscribed
upon this dagger.

458
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:22,333
It's the clue that Master
Luke was looking for.

459
00:33:22,335 --> 00:33:24,368
- And?
- Where's the wayfinder?

460
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:27,304
I am afraid
I cannot tell you.

461
00:33:27,306 --> 00:33:29,373
20.3 fazillion languages,
you can't read that?

462
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:31,009
Oh, I have read it, sir.

463
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:34,178
I know exactly
where the wayfinder is.

464
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,413
Unfortunately,
it is written

465
00:33:36,415 --> 00:33:38,282
in the runic language
of the Sith.

466
00:33:38,284 --> 00:33:39,651
So what?

467
00:33:39,653 --> 00:33:41,820
My programming forbids
me from translating it.

468
00:33:41,822 --> 00:33:43,287
So, you're telling us
the one time

469
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:44,923
we need you to talk,
you can't?

470
00:33:44,925 --> 00:33:46,658
Irony, sir.

471
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,392
I am mechanically
incapable

472
00:33:48,394 --> 00:33:50,194
of speaking translations
from Sith.

473
00:33:50,196 --> 00:33:51,562
I believe the rule
was passed

474
00:33:51,564 --> 00:33:53,965
by the Senate of
the Old Republic...

475
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:58,504
Serpent! Serpent! Serpent!

476
00:34:10,951 --> 00:34:13,486
Rey.

477
00:34:21,494 --> 00:34:22,696
- Finn.
- Shh.

478
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:41,012
- I'm gonna blast it.
- Don't blast it.

479
00:35:38,939 --> 00:35:40,772
I just transferred
a bit of life.

480
00:35:40,774 --> 00:35:42,674
Force energy
from me to him.

481
00:35:42,676 --> 00:35:45,344
You would've done the same.

482
00:36:06,933 --> 00:36:09,500
We cannot possibly fly
in that old wreck.

483
00:36:09,502 --> 00:36:11,035
We gotta keep moving.

484
00:36:11,037 --> 00:36:12,637
Find someone who can
translate that dagger.

485
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:14,338
Like a helpful droid.

486
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,975
I suggest we return to
the <i>Millennium Falcon</i> at once.

487
00:36:16,977 --> 00:36:18,810
They'll be waiting for us
at the <i>Falcon.</i>

488
00:36:18,812 --> 00:36:20,310
Yeah,
they'll throw us in the Pits of Griq.

489
00:36:20,312 --> 00:36:22,847
Yeah. And use you
as a target droid.

490
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:25,919
You both make
excellent points, at times.

491
00:36:29,956 --> 00:36:31,024
What is it?

492
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:33,660
I'll be right behind you.

493
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,561
It's okay.

494
00:36:45,304 --> 00:36:46,740
Let's see what we got.

495
00:36:48,507 --> 00:36:50,644
Let's get
those converters fired up.

496
00:36:56,183 --> 00:36:59,784
What a filthy ship!

497
00:36:59,786 --> 00:37:01,688
Look at that.

498
00:37:02,923 --> 00:37:03,924
Where is she?

499
00:37:08,728 --> 00:37:10,762
Finn,
help me out over here.

500
00:37:10,764 --> 00:37:13,465
Chewie, tell Rey we gotta go.

501
00:38:01,748 --> 00:38:03,348
What's she doing?

502
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:04,751
Where the hell's Chewie?

503
00:38:07,787 --> 00:38:08,788
It's Ren.

504
00:38:24,004 --> 00:38:25,672
<i>All right, let's go.</i>

505
00:38:26,438 --> 00:38:27,639
<i>Get in the transport.</i>

506
00:38:27,641 --> 00:38:28,842
<i>Move, animal!</i>

507
00:39:44,483 --> 00:39:45,685
Rey!

508
00:39:46,186 --> 00:39:47,251
Rey!

509
00:39:48,788 --> 00:39:51,624
They got Chewie!
They got him!

510
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,491
Chewie!

511
00:41:00,493 --> 00:41:01,728
No!

512
00:41:06,598 --> 00:41:08,134
Rey!

513
00:41:10,603 --> 00:41:12,937
We gotta go!
They're coming!

514
00:41:12,939 --> 00:41:14,505
Rey, come on!

515
00:41:17,544 --> 00:41:19,911
Rey!

516
00:41:19,913 --> 00:41:22,480
- We gotta go!
- Chewie.

517
00:41:22,482 --> 00:41:24,583
Rey, come on!

518
00:41:45,638 --> 00:41:47,273
I lost control.

519
00:41:48,508 --> 00:41:50,041
It wasn't your fault.

520
00:41:50,043 --> 00:41:51,075
It was.

521
00:41:51,077 --> 00:41:53,377
No. It was Ren.
He made you do it.

522
00:41:53,379 --> 00:41:54,881
Chewie's gone.

523
00:41:55,648 --> 00:41:58,182
That power came from me.

524
00:41:58,184 --> 00:42:00,320
Finn, there are things
you don't know.

525
00:42:01,521 --> 00:42:03,389
Then tell me.

526
00:42:09,362 --> 00:42:12,098
I, uh, had a vision.

527
00:42:14,734 --> 00:42:16,703
Of the throne of the Sith.

528
00:42:18,204 --> 00:42:19,706
And who was on it.

529
00:42:20,373 --> 00:42:21,374
Ren?

530
00:42:22,876 --> 00:42:25,278
And me.

531
00:42:40,126 --> 00:42:41,926
We recovered
the scavenger's ship,

532
00:42:41,928 --> 00:42:43,427
but she got away.

533
00:42:43,429 --> 00:42:45,296
Under command
of the Knights of Ren,

534
00:42:45,298 --> 00:42:46,697
we suffered losses.

535
00:42:46,699 --> 00:42:49,400
- A transport was destroyed.
- I've seen the report.

536
00:42:49,402 --> 00:42:51,035
That all?

537
00:42:51,037 --> 00:42:52,770
No, Allegiant General.

538
00:42:52,772 --> 00:42:54,674
There was another transport
in the desert.

539
00:42:56,009 --> 00:42:58,211
It brought back
a valuable prisoner.

540
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:01,381
Prisoner?

541
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:09,187
The beast used to fly
with Han Solo.

542
00:43:11,157 --> 00:43:13,224
Take it to Interrogation Six.

543
00:43:13,226 --> 00:43:15,426
<i>Move it.</i>

544
00:43:15,428 --> 00:43:17,028
We've only got
eight hours left.

545
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:18,429
So, what are we gonna do?

546
00:43:18,431 --> 00:43:20,064
What can we do?
We gotta go back to base.

547
00:43:20,066 --> 00:43:22,033
We don't have time to go back.
We are not giving up.

548
00:43:22,035 --> 00:43:23,768
If we do that,
Chewie died for nothing.

549
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:25,102
Poe, Chewie
had the dagger!

550
00:43:25,104 --> 00:43:26,470
Well, then we gotta
find another way.

551
00:43:26,472 --> 00:43:28,005
Well, there isn't.
That was the only clue

552
00:43:28,007 --> 00:43:29,407
to the wayfinder thing,
and it's gone.

553
00:43:29,409 --> 00:43:30,708
So true.

554
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:32,979
The inscription lives
only in my memory now.

555
00:43:35,048 --> 00:43:36,648
Hold on.

556
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:39,685
The inscription that was on
the dagger is in your memory?

557
00:43:39,687 --> 00:43:41,152
Yes, Master Poe.

558
00:43:41,154 --> 00:43:43,087
But the translation
from a forbidden language

559
00:43:43,089 --> 00:43:44,522
cannot be retrieved.

560
00:43:44,524 --> 00:43:47,659
That is short of a complete
redacted memory bypass.

561
00:43:47,661 --> 00:43:48,960
A complete what?

562
00:43:48,962 --> 00:43:50,428
It's a terribly
dangerous and sinful act...

563
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:53,431
performed on unwitting droids
by dregs and criminals.

564
00:43:53,433 --> 00:43:54,732
Let's do that.

565
00:43:54,734 --> 00:43:56,500
I know
a black market droidsmith.

566
00:43:56,502 --> 00:43:57,902
Black market droidsmith?

567
00:43:57,904 --> 00:43:59,770
- But he's on Kijimi.
- What's wrong with Kijimi?

568
00:43:59,772 --> 00:44:01,374
I had a little bad luck
on Kijimi.

569
00:44:03,009 --> 00:44:06,077
But if this mission fails,
it's all been for nothing.

570
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:08,881
All we've done,
all this time.

571
00:44:10,883 --> 00:44:12,819
We're all in this.

572
00:44:13,886 --> 00:44:15,388
Until the end.

573
00:44:19,727 --> 00:44:20,927
For Chewie.

574
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:24,264
- Hands?
- Hands.

575
00:44:25,633 --> 00:44:26,833
For Chewie.

576
00:44:31,605 --> 00:44:32,805
Kijimi.

577
00:45:06,607 --> 00:45:08,341
Battery charged.

578
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:10,676
Hello.

579
00:45:15,716 --> 00:45:17,214
Hello.

580
00:45:17,216 --> 00:45:19,052
- Hello.
- No... No, thank you.

581
00:45:21,521 --> 00:45:24,188
Looks like someone
treated him badly.

582
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:27,091
It's all right.
You're with us now.

583
00:45:35,068 --> 00:45:37,068
<i>U-A-T-T walker patrol,</i>

584
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:38,670
<i>head down thoroughfare 60.</i>

585
00:45:53,787 --> 00:45:55,920
<i>Open up.
You're wanted for questioning.</i>

586
00:46:00,593 --> 00:46:02,860
<i>Check this side of the street.</i>

587
00:46:06,532 --> 00:46:07,799
<i>Door is locked.</i>

588
00:46:07,801 --> 00:46:09,367
<i>Move on to the next one.</i>

589
00:46:09,369 --> 00:46:11,235
<i>Give me
regular reports, please.</i>

590
00:46:11,237 --> 00:46:13,772
<i>You, up against the wall.</i>

591
00:46:13,774 --> 00:46:16,040
<i>Show me your identification.</i>

592
00:46:16,042 --> 00:46:17,443
<i>Where is your identification?</i>

593
00:46:18,612 --> 00:46:20,378
They're everywhere.

594
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:22,213
Please, leave her alone.
She didn't do anything.

595
00:46:22,215 --> 00:46:23,749
All right,
I know what we should do.

596
00:46:23,751 --> 00:46:25,416
So do I.
We should leave.

597
00:46:25,418 --> 00:46:27,084
Clam it, Threepio.

598
00:46:27,086 --> 00:46:28,287
Follow me.

599
00:46:35,528 --> 00:46:37,997
All right.
Let's head down this way.

600
00:46:39,633 --> 00:46:41,565
<i>Heard you were
spotted at Monk's Gate.</i>

601
00:46:41,567 --> 00:46:44,636
<i>Thought, "He's not stupid
enough to come back here."</i>

602
00:46:44,638 --> 00:46:46,137
Oh, you'd be surprised.

603
00:46:46,139 --> 00:46:47,639
- Who's this?
- What's going on?

604
00:46:47,641 --> 00:46:49,775
Guys, this is Zorii.
Zorii, this is Rey and Finn.

605
00:46:49,777 --> 00:46:51,575
<i>I could pull this
trigger right now.</i>

606
00:46:51,577 --> 00:46:53,210
- I've seen you do worse.
- <i>For a lot less.</i>

607
00:46:53,212 --> 00:46:56,280
Can we just, uh...
talk about this?

608
00:46:56,282 --> 00:46:58,617
<i>I wanna see your
brains in the snow.</i>

609
00:46:58,619 --> 00:46:59,917
So, you're still mad?

610
00:46:59,919 --> 00:47:01,318
Zorii, we could
use your help.

611
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,120
We gotta crack this droid's
head open and fast.

612
00:47:03,122 --> 00:47:04,321
Pardon me!

613
00:47:04,323 --> 00:47:05,724
We're trying to find
Babu Frik.

614
00:47:05,726 --> 00:47:06,825
<i>Babu?
Babu only works with the crew.</i>

615
00:47:06,827 --> 00:47:08,125
<i>That's not you anymore.</i>

616
00:47:08,127 --> 00:47:09,393
What crew?

617
00:47:09,395 --> 00:47:10,862
<i>Oh, funny
he never mentioned it.</i>

618
00:47:10,864 --> 00:47:13,632
<i>Your friend's old job
was running spice.</i>

619
00:47:13,634 --> 00:47:15,065
You were a spice runner?

620
00:47:15,067 --> 00:47:16,735
- You were a stormtrooper?
- Were you a spice runner?

621
00:47:16,737 --> 00:47:18,335
Were you a scavenger?
We could do this all night.

622
00:47:18,337 --> 00:47:19,871
<i>You don't have
all night.</i>

623
00:47:19,873 --> 00:47:22,239
<i>You know, I'm still digging
out of the hole you put me in</i>

624
00:47:22,241 --> 00:47:24,210
<i>when you left
to join the Resistance.</i>

625
00:47:24,912 --> 00:47:26,310
<i>You.</i>

626
00:47:26,312 --> 00:47:28,012
<i>You're the one
they're looking for.</i>

627
00:47:28,014 --> 00:47:30,147
<i>Bounty for her
just might cover us.</i>

628
00:47:30,149 --> 00:47:32,116
- <i>Djak'kankah!</i>
- Don't <i>djak'kankah.</i>

629
00:47:39,225 --> 00:47:41,358
We could really use
your help.

630
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,562
Please.

631
00:47:43,797 --> 00:47:47,198
<i>Not that you care...</i>

632
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,968
<i>but I think you're okay.</i>

633
00:47:49,502 --> 00:47:50,704
I care.

634
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:56,507
<i>T-18's online yet?</i>

635
00:47:56,509 --> 00:47:58,077
<i>Yes, sir.
Scouting the perimeter.</i>

636
00:47:59,412 --> 00:48:01,615
<i>Walkers.
Stay close by.</i>

637
00:48:03,717 --> 00:48:06,751
Poe Dameron, spice runner.
Runner of spice.

638
00:48:06,753 --> 00:48:08,519
- All right.
- Get your spice!

639
00:48:08,521 --> 00:48:10,356
- Come on, Threepio.
- Oh.

640
00:48:25,204 --> 00:48:26,605
<i>Babu's in the back.</i>

641
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:38,417
Don't mind us.

642
00:48:42,656 --> 00:48:46,023
I haven't the faintest idea
why I agreed to this.

643
00:48:46,025 --> 00:48:47,926
I must be malfunctioning.

644
00:48:47,928 --> 00:48:49,595
I must be malfunctioning.

645
00:48:50,664 --> 00:48:51,997
Babu Frik?

646
00:48:51,999 --> 00:48:53,732
Can you help us with this?

647
00:48:59,071 --> 00:49:01,438
Zorii?
Is this gonna work?

648
00:49:07,547 --> 00:49:08,947
<i>He says
he's found something</i>

649
00:49:08,949 --> 00:49:10,247
<i>in your droid's
forbidden memory bank.</i>

650
00:49:10,249 --> 00:49:11,950
<i>Words, translated
from Sith.</i>

651
00:49:11,952 --> 00:49:14,151
- That's it.
- Yeah, that's what we need.

652
00:49:14,153 --> 00:49:16,988
<i>Who are you hanging out
with that speaks Sith?</i>

653
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:18,556
Can you make him...

654
00:49:18,558 --> 00:49:20,759
Babu, can you make him
translate it?

655
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:26,063
<i>Yes. But it will
cause a complete...</i>

656
00:49:26,065 --> 00:49:27,666
A complete
memory wipe.

657
00:49:27,668 --> 00:49:29,533
Wait, wait, wait.
We make him translate it...

658
00:49:29,535 --> 00:49:32,069
he won't remember...
anything?

659
00:49:32,071 --> 00:49:34,104
Droid, memory go blank.

660
00:49:34,106 --> 00:49:35,306
- Oh!
- Blank, blank.

661
00:49:35,308 --> 00:49:36,574
There must be
some other way.

662
00:49:36,576 --> 00:49:38,009
Doesn't Artoo back up
your memory?

663
00:49:38,011 --> 00:49:39,343
Oh, please.

664
00:49:39,345 --> 00:49:42,379
Artoo's storage units
are famously unreliable.

665
00:49:42,381 --> 00:49:44,517
You know the odds
better than any of us.

666
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:47,854
Do we have a choice?

667
00:49:53,994 --> 00:49:56,895
If this mission fails...

668
00:49:56,897 --> 00:49:58,632
it was all for nothing.

669
00:49:59,866 --> 00:50:01,534
All we've done...

670
00:50:02,234 --> 00:50:04,103
all this time.

671
00:50:08,675 --> 00:50:10,343
What are you doing there,
Threepio?

672
00:50:11,243 --> 00:50:14,113
Taking one last look,
sir...

673
00:50:14,748 --> 00:50:16,617
at my friends.

674
00:50:19,653 --> 00:50:20,654
Sad.

675
00:50:23,489 --> 00:50:24,889
Uh-oh.

676
00:50:24,891 --> 00:50:26,691
<i>Night raids
are gonna start soon.</i>

677
00:50:26,693 --> 00:50:28,459
- <i>I'll keep lookout.</i>
- I'm coming with you.

678
00:50:28,461 --> 00:50:31,062
<i>You still
don't trust me, huh?</i>

679
00:50:31,064 --> 00:50:32,229
Did you
ever trust me?

680
00:50:32,231 --> 00:50:33,530
<i>Nope.</i>

681
00:50:38,739 --> 00:50:40,337
<i>Report,
General Pryde.</i>

682
00:50:40,339 --> 00:50:41,673
There's been
a development, sir.

683
00:50:41,675 --> 00:50:43,942
The Knights of Ren
have tracked the scavenger.

684
00:50:43,944 --> 00:50:45,576
To a settlement
called Kijimi.

685
00:50:45,578 --> 00:50:47,912
Shall we destroy
the city,

686
00:50:47,914 --> 00:50:49,248
Supreme...?

687
00:50:55,221 --> 00:50:56,520
I just had an idea.

688
00:50:56,522 --> 00:50:58,288
There's something else
we could try.

689
00:51:12,505 --> 00:51:14,538
How long's it been
like this?

690
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:17,709
<i>First Order took most
of the kids a long time ago.</i>

691
00:51:17,711 --> 00:51:20,111
<i>Can't stand the cries
anymore.</i>

692
00:51:20,113 --> 00:51:22,179
<i>I've saved up enough
to get out.</i>

693
00:51:22,181 --> 00:51:23,514
<i>I'm going to the Colonies.</i>

694
00:51:23,516 --> 00:51:25,518
How? All those hyperlanes
are blocked.

695
00:51:29,455 --> 00:51:33,091
That's a First Order
Captain's medallion.

696
00:51:33,093 --> 00:51:34,693
I've never seen a real one.

697
00:51:34,695 --> 00:51:36,593
<i>Free passage
through any blockade.</i>

698
00:51:36,595 --> 00:51:38,632
<i>Landing privileges,
any vessel.</i>

699
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,775
<i>Wanna come with me?</i>

700
00:51:55,314 --> 00:51:57,583
I can't walk out
on this war.

701
00:51:59,318 --> 00:52:01,385
Not till it's over.

702
00:52:01,387 --> 00:52:02,823
Maybe it is.

703
00:52:04,758 --> 00:52:07,794
We sent out a call for help
at the Battle of Crait.

704
00:52:09,395 --> 00:52:11,495
Nobody came.

705
00:52:11,497 --> 00:52:13,332
Everyone's so afraid.

706
00:52:15,902 --> 00:52:17,369
They've given up.

707
00:52:18,605 --> 00:52:21,340
<i>No, I don't believe
you believe that.</i>

708
00:52:24,111 --> 00:52:25,977
<i>Hey.</i>

709
00:52:25,979 --> 00:52:29,381
<i>They win by making you
think you're alone.</i>

710
00:52:30,416 --> 00:52:32,351
<i>Remember?</i>

711
00:52:35,055 --> 00:52:36,923
<i>There's more of us.</i>

712
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:42,994
Squeaky wheel.

713
00:52:42,996 --> 00:52:44,698
I have a squeaky wheel.

714
00:52:49,236 --> 00:52:51,836
Squeak eliminated.

715
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:53,638
Thank you.

716
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:54,875
Very kind.

717
00:53:01,748 --> 00:53:04,082
Something's not right
about all of this.

718
00:53:04,084 --> 00:53:05,382
Hmm?

719
00:53:05,384 --> 00:53:06,684
I know
where I've seen it.

720
00:53:06,686 --> 00:53:09,187
The ship he was on.
Ochi's ship.

721
00:53:09,189 --> 00:53:10,622
What?

722
00:53:10,624 --> 00:53:12,458
The day my parents left.

723
00:53:13,292 --> 00:53:14,861
They were on that ship.

724
00:53:15,896 --> 00:53:18,062
Are you sure?

725
00:53:18,064 --> 00:53:19,631
<i>There's an
incoming Destroyer.</i>

726
00:53:19,633 --> 00:53:22,133
We gotta go now.
Did we get it? Babu?

727
00:53:22,135 --> 00:53:25,236
Yep. Droid is ready!

728
00:53:29,408 --> 00:53:31,042
The Emperor's wayfinder

729
00:53:31,044 --> 00:53:32,610
is in the Imperial vault.

730
00:53:32,612 --> 00:53:36,848
At delta 3-6, transient
9-3-6, bearing 3-2...

731
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:39,284
on a moon
in the Endor system.

732
00:53:39,286 --> 00:53:40,718
From the southern shore.

733
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,588
Only this blade tells.

734
00:53:43,422 --> 00:53:45,091
Only this blade tells.

735
00:53:49,461 --> 00:53:51,129
The Endor system.

736
00:53:51,131 --> 00:53:52,297
Where the last war ended?

737
00:53:59,706 --> 00:54:00,774
Rey!

738
00:54:04,244 --> 00:54:05,442
Ren's Destroyer.

739
00:54:05,444 --> 00:54:06,713
He's here?

740
00:54:11,017 --> 00:54:12,351
Chewie?

741
00:54:13,586 --> 00:54:15,186
What about him?

742
00:54:15,188 --> 00:54:17,121
He's on Ren's ship.

743
00:54:17,123 --> 00:54:18,656
He's alive.

744
00:54:18,658 --> 00:54:20,325
What? How?

745
00:54:20,327 --> 00:54:22,492
He's alive! He must've
been on a different transport.

746
00:54:22,494 --> 00:54:23,962
We gotta go get him.

747
00:54:23,964 --> 00:54:25,129
<i>Your friend's
on that sky trash?</i>

748
00:54:25,131 --> 00:54:26,530
I guess he is.

749
00:54:26,532 --> 00:54:27,899
Might I introduce myself.

750
00:54:27,901 --> 00:54:32,402
I am C-3PO, human-cyborg
relations. And you are?

751
00:54:32,404 --> 00:54:33,570
Okay, that's gonna be
a problem.

752
00:54:33,572 --> 00:54:36,174
Hello.
I Babu Frik.

753
00:54:36,176 --> 00:54:37,644
Why, hello!

754
00:54:45,185 --> 00:54:47,785
Threepio, move your metal ass.
We're almost there.

755
00:54:47,787 --> 00:54:50,021
How dare you!
We've only just met.

756
00:54:50,023 --> 00:54:51,189
<i>Poe.</i>

757
00:54:51,191 --> 00:54:53,590
<i>Might get you
on a capital ship.</i>

758
00:54:53,592 --> 00:54:54,828
<i>Go help your friend.</i>

759
00:54:56,129 --> 00:54:57,729
Zorii, I don't think
I can take this.

760
00:54:57,731 --> 00:54:59,565
<i>I don't care
what you think.</i>

761
00:55:02,335 --> 00:55:04,434
We have to go. Now.

762
00:55:04,436 --> 00:55:06,604
- Come with us.
- <i>Poe.</i>

763
00:55:06,606 --> 00:55:07,705
Can I kiss you?

764
00:55:07,707 --> 00:55:09,009
<i>Go.</i>

765
00:55:14,546 --> 00:55:15,914
We've done nothing wrong!

766
00:55:15,916 --> 00:55:17,382
<i>No sudden moves.</i>

767
00:55:17,384 --> 00:55:19,019
<i>What is that? Stop moving.</i>

768
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:35,366
Medallion's good.

769
00:55:35,368 --> 00:55:37,335
Clear for entrance
into hangar 12.

770
00:55:37,337 --> 00:55:38,468
Hang on, Chewie.

771
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:39,971
We're coming.

772
00:55:39,973 --> 00:55:42,541
Whoever this Chewie
person is, this is madness!

773
00:55:52,551 --> 00:55:54,085
<i>Credentials and manifest.</i>

774
00:55:55,288 --> 00:55:56,890
<i>Close the blast doors.</i>

775
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:02,060
- You three, stay there.
- Happily.

776
00:56:02,062 --> 00:56:03,127
Which way?

777
00:56:03,129 --> 00:56:04,596
Uh, no idea. Follow me.

778
00:56:26,186 --> 00:56:27,685
<i>Drop your weapons.</i>

779
00:56:27,687 --> 00:56:30,688
It's okay that we're here.

780
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:32,023
<i>It's okay that you're here.</i>

781
00:56:32,025 --> 00:56:33,458
<i>It's good.</i>

782
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:34,959
You're relieved
that we're here.

783
00:56:34,961 --> 00:56:36,160
<i>Thank goodness you're here.</i>

784
00:56:36,162 --> 00:56:37,261
<i>Welcome, guys.</i>

785
00:56:37,263 --> 00:56:38,629
Does she do that to us?

786
00:56:38,631 --> 00:56:40,633
We're looking for a prisoner
and his belongings.

787
00:56:42,402 --> 00:56:43,603
The cameras.

788
00:56:47,841 --> 00:56:49,575
They said
Chewie's this way.

789
00:56:59,786 --> 00:57:01,019
Rey, come on.

790
00:57:01,021 --> 00:57:03,189
The dagger is on this ship.
We need it.

791
00:57:04,157 --> 00:57:05,158
Why?

792
00:57:06,793 --> 00:57:08,793
A feeling. I'll meet you
back at the hangar.

793
00:57:08,795 --> 00:57:10,063
Rey, you can't just...

794
00:57:11,264 --> 00:57:12,265
Chewie.

795
00:57:18,038 --> 00:57:19,973
<i>Search the city again.</i>

796
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:24,409
<i>She's close.</i>

797
00:57:27,579 --> 00:57:29,213
Of course
we came for you, Chewie.

798
00:57:30,483 --> 00:57:32,085
Yeah, Rey's here.
She's gonna get the dagger.

799
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:40,557
Whose ship is this?

800
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:42,860
The ship's this way.
Follow me.

801
00:57:42,862 --> 00:57:44,064
<i>Over here!</i>

802
00:57:45,498 --> 00:57:47,198
Wrong way!

803
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,202
There's not really
a right way, is there?

804
00:57:51,171 --> 00:57:52,571
<i>I found them.</i>

805
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:55,008
<i>Blast them!</i>

806
00:57:59,045 --> 00:58:00,311
<i>Over here!</i>

807
00:58:00,313 --> 00:58:01,314
<i>There they are.
Get them!</i>

808
00:58:17,197 --> 00:58:18,763
- We close?
- Straight ahead.

809
00:58:18,765 --> 00:58:19,966
<i>Blast them!</i>

810
00:58:22,302 --> 00:58:24,104
<i>Halt!</i>

811
00:58:26,706 --> 00:58:27,941
Poe!

812
00:58:31,311 --> 00:58:33,044
Are you okay?

813
00:58:33,046 --> 00:58:34,912
Nope.

814
00:58:34,914 --> 00:58:36,814
<i>You there, hands up!</i>

815
00:58:36,816 --> 00:58:38,716
<i>Drop your weapons now!</i>

816
00:58:38,718 --> 00:58:40,218
<i>Put your weapons down!</i>

817
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:41,886
<i>Drop them!</i>

818
00:58:41,888 --> 00:58:43,723
<i>Drop them now!</i>

819
00:58:45,325 --> 00:58:46,624
Hey, fellas.

820
00:58:46,626 --> 00:58:47,692
<i>Shut up, scum.</i>

821
00:59:28,535 --> 00:59:30,203
<i>No!</i>

822
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:32,537
<i>No!</i>

823
00:59:32,539 --> 00:59:33,804
No.

824
00:59:33,806 --> 00:59:35,175
<i>Rey.</i>

825
00:59:37,410 --> 00:59:39,076
<i>Wherever you are...</i>

826
00:59:39,078 --> 00:59:40,912
<i>you are hard to find.</i>

827
00:59:40,914 --> 00:59:42,749
You're hard to get rid of.

828
00:59:44,350 --> 00:59:45,883
<i>I pushed you in the desert,</i>

829
00:59:45,885 --> 00:59:47,787
<i>because I needed to see it.</i>

830
00:59:48,688 --> 00:59:50,988
<i>I needed you to see it.</i>

831
00:59:50,990 --> 00:59:53,659
<i>Who you are.</i>

832
00:59:53,661 --> 00:59:55,929
<i>I know
the rest of your story.</i>

833
00:59:58,031 --> 00:59:59,032
<i>Rey.</i>

834
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:02,833
You're lying.

835
01:00:02,835 --> 01:00:05,136
<i>I never lied to you.</i>

836
01:00:05,138 --> 01:00:06,739
<i>Your parents were no one.</i>

837
01:00:08,074 --> 01:00:09,475
<i>They chose to be.</i>

838
01:00:10,644 --> 01:00:11,842
<i>To keep you safe.</i>

839
01:00:11,844 --> 01:00:13,044
Don't!

840
01:00:13,046 --> 01:00:14,979
<i>You remember
more than you say.</i>

841
01:00:14,981 --> 01:00:16,414
<i>I've been in your head.</i>

842
01:00:16,416 --> 01:00:17,481
I don't want this!

843
01:00:17,483 --> 01:00:18,617
<i>Search your memories.</i>

844
01:00:18,619 --> 01:00:19,685
No!

845
01:00:23,624 --> 01:00:25,523
<i>Remember them.</i>

846
01:00:25,525 --> 01:00:26,926
<i>See them.</i>

847
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:32,131
My love.
Rey, be brave.

848
01:00:34,767 --> 01:00:36,169
You'll be safe here.

849
01:00:36,704 --> 01:00:38,137
I promise.

850
01:00:39,872 --> 01:00:41,239
Come back!

851
01:00:41,241 --> 01:00:42,242
No!

852
01:00:48,881 --> 01:00:51,249
<i>They sold you
to protect you.</i>

853
01:00:51,251 --> 01:00:52,216
Stop talking.

854
01:00:52,218 --> 01:00:54,518
<i>Rey, I know
what happened to them.</i>

855
01:01:03,196 --> 01:01:04,497
<i>Move it.</i>

856
01:01:06,032 --> 01:01:07,365
<i>Allegiant General,</i>

857
01:01:07,367 --> 01:01:08,667
<i>the scavenger is not
with them.</i>

858
01:01:08,669 --> 01:01:10,870
Take them away.
Terminate them.

859
01:01:16,309 --> 01:01:17,842
<i>Tell me where you are.</i>

860
01:01:17,844 --> 01:01:20,313
<i>You don't know
the whole story.</i>

861
01:01:23,816 --> 01:01:27,553
<i>It was Palpatine
who had your parents taken.</i>

862
01:01:28,756 --> 01:01:31,088
<i>He was looking for you.</i>

863
01:01:31,090 --> 01:01:33,893
<i>But they wouldn't say
where you were.</i>

864
01:01:34,662 --> 01:01:36,396
<i>So he gave the order.</i>

865
01:01:40,867 --> 01:01:43,267
She isn't on Jakku.
She's gone.

866
01:01:43,269 --> 01:01:44,470
No!

867
01:01:45,838 --> 01:01:47,040
No!

868
01:01:56,816 --> 01:01:58,251
<i>So that's where you are.</i>

869
01:02:03,624 --> 01:02:06,424
<i>You know why the Emperor's
always wanted you dead.</i>

870
01:02:06,426 --> 01:02:07,992
No.

871
01:02:07,994 --> 01:02:09,429
<i>I'll come tell you.</i>

872
01:02:15,703 --> 01:02:18,504
<i>She was in my quarters.
Lock down the ship.</i>

873
01:02:22,508 --> 01:02:23,610
Actually...

874
01:02:24,977 --> 01:02:26,879
I'd like to do this myself.

875
01:02:31,084 --> 01:02:32,919
What were you gonna
tell Rey before?

876
01:02:33,754 --> 01:02:35,519
You still on that?

877
01:02:35,521 --> 01:02:36,887
Oh, I'm sorry,
is this a bad time?

878
01:02:38,024 --> 01:02:39,624
Yeah.
Sort of is a bad time, Poe.

879
01:02:39,626 --> 01:02:41,158
Well, 'cause later doesn't
really look like an option.

880
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:42,326
If you're gonna let
something off your chest,

881
01:02:42,328 --> 01:02:43,628
maybe now's not
the worst time to...

882
01:02:47,867 --> 01:02:49,300
I'm the spy.

883
01:02:49,302 --> 01:02:51,001
- What?
- You?

884
01:02:51,003 --> 01:02:52,503
We don't have much time.

885
01:02:52,505 --> 01:02:53,705
I knew it.

886
01:02:53,707 --> 01:02:55,206
No, you did not.

887
01:02:55,208 --> 01:02:56,207
<i>What's your operating number?</i>

888
01:02:57,877 --> 01:02:59,245
<i>That's not even a language.</i>

889
01:03:03,049 --> 01:03:05,583
Oh, dear!
My first laser battle.

890
01:03:05,585 --> 01:03:07,987
- Where are the others?
- They haven't come back.

891
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:15,393
Find them.

892
01:03:15,395 --> 01:03:16,996
- Go.
- Yes.

893
01:03:21,033 --> 01:03:23,134
Friends ahead.

894
01:03:23,136 --> 01:03:24,568
Oh, yes,
there they are!

895
01:03:24,570 --> 01:03:25,970
BB-8, come on!

896
01:03:25,972 --> 01:03:27,238
I'll shut down the
impeders. You've got seconds.

897
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:28,939
There she is.

898
01:03:28,941 --> 01:03:30,842
She's a survivor.

899
01:03:30,844 --> 01:03:32,143
Wait. Wait.

900
01:03:32,145 --> 01:03:34,111
- Blast me in the arm. Quick.
- What?

901
01:03:34,113 --> 01:03:35,314
Or they'll know.

902
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:39,283
No! Ahh!

903
01:03:39,285 --> 01:03:41,087
Why are you helping us?

904
01:03:41,954 --> 01:03:44,288
I don't care if you win.

905
01:03:44,290 --> 01:03:46,993
I need Kylo Ren to lose.

906
01:04:12,251 --> 01:04:15,152
Why did the Emperor
come for me?

907
01:04:15,154 --> 01:04:17,691
Why did he want
to kill a child?

908
01:04:18,926 --> 01:04:20,357
Tell me.

909
01:04:20,359 --> 01:04:22,595
<i>Because he saw
what you would become.</i>

910
01:04:23,664 --> 01:04:25,531
<i>You don't just have power.</i>

911
01:04:27,099 --> 01:04:29,200
<i>You have his power.</i>

912
01:04:29,202 --> 01:04:30,503
<i>You're his granddaughter.</i>

913
01:04:32,205 --> 01:04:35,508
<i>You are a Palpatine.</i>

914
01:04:43,249 --> 01:04:45,983
<i>My mother
was the daughter of Vader.</i>

915
01:04:45,985 --> 01:04:49,153
<i>Your father
was the son of the Emperor.</i>

916
01:04:49,155 --> 01:04:51,088
<i>What Palpatine
doesn't know</i>

917
01:04:51,090 --> 01:04:53,692
<i>is we're a dyad
in the Force, Rey.</i>

918
01:04:53,694 --> 01:04:55,660
<i>Two that are one.</i>

919
01:05:03,202 --> 01:05:08,038
<i>We'll kill him together
and take the throne.</i>

920
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:19,118
You know
what you need to do.

921
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,454
You know.

922
01:05:30,429 --> 01:05:31,830
I do.

923
01:05:39,171 --> 01:05:40,573
Hold her steady.

924
01:05:45,111 --> 01:05:46,312
Finn, move fast!

925
01:05:47,681 --> 01:05:49,146
Rey!

926
01:05:49,148 --> 01:05:51,181
Come on!

927
01:05:55,154 --> 01:05:56,487
Come on!
I got you!

928
01:06:04,597 --> 01:06:08,132
It was a coordinated
incursion, Allegiant General.

929
01:06:08,134 --> 01:06:09,533
They overpowered the guards

930
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:11,270
and forced me
to take them to their ship.

931
01:06:11,772 --> 01:06:13,805
I see.

932
01:06:13,807 --> 01:06:15,172
Get me the Supreme Leader.

933
01:06:15,174 --> 01:06:16,342
Yes, sir.

934
01:06:20,379 --> 01:06:22,548
Tell him we found our spy.

935
01:06:25,418 --> 01:06:27,151
I don't know why
they're not following us,

936
01:06:27,153 --> 01:06:28,218
but I don't trust it.

937
01:06:29,488 --> 01:06:31,121
Landing gear's busted?
How busted?

938
01:06:32,859 --> 01:06:35,860
All that matters is the wayfinder.
Finding Exegol.

939
01:06:35,862 --> 01:06:37,530
That's what we're doing.

940
01:06:42,101 --> 01:06:44,236
He killed my mother.

941
01:06:45,639 --> 01:06:47,473
And my father.

942
01:06:49,508 --> 01:06:51,612
I'm going to find
Palpatine...

943
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:54,480
and destroy him.

944
01:06:56,115 --> 01:06:57,849
Rey...

945
01:06:57,851 --> 01:06:59,385
that doesn't sound
like you.

946
01:07:01,722 --> 01:07:03,354
Rey, I know you...

947
01:07:03,356 --> 01:07:05,358
People keep telling me
they know me.

948
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,629
I'm afraid no one does.

949
01:07:13,867 --> 01:07:18,435
<i>The Jedi
apprentice still lives.</i>

950
01:07:18,437 --> 01:07:22,439
<i>Perhaps you
have betrayed me.</i>

951
01:07:22,441 --> 01:07:26,611
<i>Do not make me
turn my fleet against you.</i>

952
01:07:26,613 --> 01:07:28,813
<i>I know where she's going.</i>

953
01:07:28,815 --> 01:07:30,147
<i>She'll never be a Jedi.</i>

954
01:07:30,149 --> 01:07:31,816
<i>Make sure of it.</i>

955
01:07:31,818 --> 01:07:33,219
<i>Kill her.</i>

956
01:08:15,361 --> 01:08:17,062
What...
What is that?

957
01:08:17,064 --> 01:08:18,362
It's the Death Star.

958
01:08:18,364 --> 01:08:21,766
A bad place
from an old war.

959
01:08:21,768 --> 01:08:24,368
It's gonna take us years to
find what we're looking for.

960
01:08:24,370 --> 01:08:26,470
Oh, dear.

961
01:08:26,472 --> 01:08:28,608
"Only this blade tells."

962
01:09:02,709 --> 01:09:05,242
The wayfinder's there.

963
01:09:05,244 --> 01:09:06,479
Heads up.

964
01:09:13,954 --> 01:09:15,352
Rough landing.

965
01:09:15,354 --> 01:09:17,556
- I've seen worse.
- I've seen better.

966
01:09:19,458 --> 01:09:20,992
Are you Resistance?

967
01:09:20,994 --> 01:09:22,660
That depends.

968
01:09:22,662 --> 01:09:24,996
We picked up a transmission
from someone named Babu Frik.

969
01:09:24,998 --> 01:09:28,600
Babu Frik? Oh,
he's one of my oldest friends.

970
01:09:28,602 --> 01:09:30,201
He said you'd come.

971
01:09:30,203 --> 01:09:32,005
He said
you were the last hope.

972
01:09:33,774 --> 01:09:35,439
We have to get to that wreck.

973
01:09:35,441 --> 01:09:37,242
There is something
inside there we need.

974
01:09:37,244 --> 01:09:38,710
I can take you there
by water.

975
01:09:38,712 --> 01:09:40,812
- Have you seen the water?
- Not now.

976
01:09:40,814 --> 01:09:42,379
Too dangerous.

977
01:09:42,381 --> 01:09:43,748
We can go
first light tomorrow.

978
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:46,019
We can't wait that long.
We don't have the time.

979
01:09:46,987 --> 01:09:48,753
Or the choice.

980
01:09:48,755 --> 01:09:50,554
Let's get that ship fixed.

981
01:09:50,556 --> 01:09:51,990
Do you have any spare parts?

982
01:09:51,992 --> 01:09:53,158
Some.

983
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:54,628
- I'm Jannah.
- I'm Poe.

984
01:10:04,503 --> 01:10:05,705
Hello.

985
01:10:07,974 --> 01:10:10,474
No, thank you. No, thank you.

986
01:10:10,476 --> 01:10:12,409
What a dreadful situation.

987
01:10:12,411 --> 01:10:14,879
Is every day like this
for you people?

988
01:10:14,881 --> 01:10:15,980
Madness.

989
01:10:15,982 --> 01:10:18,850
Did we ever find
his volume control?

990
01:10:18,852 --> 01:10:21,152
It's an O-6,
but should work.

991
01:10:21,154 --> 01:10:22,488
Thank you.

992
01:10:24,658 --> 01:10:26,157
This is a First Order part.

993
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:28,193
There's an old cruiser
on the west ridge.

994
01:10:28,195 --> 01:10:29,495
Stripped for parts.

995
01:10:30,496 --> 01:10:32,362
The one we were assigned to.

996
01:10:32,364 --> 01:10:34,464
The one we escaped in.

997
01:10:34,466 --> 01:10:37,936
Okay, wait.
You were First Order?

998
01:10:37,938 --> 01:10:38,972
Not by choice.

999
01:10:41,641 --> 01:10:44,510
We were conscripted
as kids. All of us.

1000
01:10:45,377 --> 01:10:48,246
I was TZ-1719.
Stormtrooper.

1001
01:10:48,248 --> 01:10:49,649
FN-2187.

1002
01:10:50,717 --> 01:10:51,683
You?

1003
01:10:51,685 --> 01:10:53,151
I never knew
there were more.

1004
01:10:53,153 --> 01:10:56,520
Deserters? All of us here
were stormtroopers.

1005
01:10:56,522 --> 01:10:59,356
We mutinied at the battle
of Ansett Island.

1006
01:10:59,358 --> 01:11:01,491
They told us
to fire on civilians.

1007
01:11:01,493 --> 01:11:02,660
We wouldn't do it.

1008
01:11:02,662 --> 01:11:04,561
We laid our weapons down.

1009
01:11:04,563 --> 01:11:06,430
- All of you?
- The whole company.

1010
01:11:07,934 --> 01:11:11,135
I don't even know
how it happened.

1011
01:11:11,137 --> 01:11:14,005
It wasn't a decision, really,
it was like...

1012
01:11:14,007 --> 01:11:15,041
An instinct.

1013
01:11:16,109 --> 01:11:17,376
Feeling.

1014
01:11:18,011 --> 01:11:19,378
A feeling.

1015
01:11:20,347 --> 01:11:22,379
The Force.

1016
01:11:22,381 --> 01:11:24,017
The Force
brought me here.

1017
01:11:25,285 --> 01:11:28,920
It brought me to Rey.
And Poe.

1018
01:11:28,922 --> 01:11:31,423
You say that
like you're sure it's real.

1019
01:11:32,192 --> 01:11:34,125
It's real.

1020
01:11:34,127 --> 01:11:35,729
I wasn't sure then...

1021
01:11:37,631 --> 01:11:39,964
but I am now.

1022
01:11:39,966 --> 01:11:41,531
What is it, buddy?

1023
01:11:43,904 --> 01:11:45,739
What do you mean
you haven't seen her?

1024
01:12:01,054 --> 01:12:02,554
She took the skimmer?

1025
01:12:37,523 --> 01:12:38,756
What the hell
was she thinking?

1026
01:12:38,758 --> 01:12:40,792
Poe, we gotta go
after her.

1027
01:12:40,794 --> 01:12:42,093
We'll get
the <i>Falcon</i> fixed,

1028
01:12:42,095 --> 01:12:43,527
and get out there
as fast as we can.

1029
01:12:43,529 --> 01:12:45,096
No,
we're gonna lose her.

1030
01:12:45,098 --> 01:12:46,197
Look, she left us!
What do you wanna do? Swim?

1031
01:12:46,199 --> 01:12:47,365
She's not herself.

1032
01:12:47,367 --> 01:12:48,565
You have no idea
what she's fighting.

1033
01:12:48,567 --> 01:12:49,769
And you do?

1034
01:12:52,005 --> 01:12:54,105
Yeah, I do.

1035
01:12:54,107 --> 01:12:55,141
And so does Leia.

1036
01:12:56,276 --> 01:12:58,309
Well, I'm not Leia.

1037
01:12:58,311 --> 01:12:59,813
That's for damn sure.

1038
01:13:23,470 --> 01:13:24,671
Finn.

1039
01:13:25,405 --> 01:13:26,806
There's another skimmer.

1040
01:16:16,776 --> 01:16:19,212
Don't be afraid
of who you are.

1041
01:16:53,313 --> 01:16:56,380
Look at yourself.

1042
01:16:56,382 --> 01:16:58,449
You wanted to prove to my
mother that you were a Jedi...

1043
01:16:58,451 --> 01:17:00,320
but you've proven
something else.

1044
01:17:03,790 --> 01:17:05,858
You can't go back to her now.

1045
01:17:07,794 --> 01:17:09,095
Like I can't.

1046
01:17:11,331 --> 01:17:12,396
Give it to me.

1047
01:17:16,035 --> 01:17:19,005
The dark side
is in our nature.

1048
01:17:22,008 --> 01:17:23,376
Surrender to it.

1049
01:17:24,344 --> 01:17:25,411
Give it...

1050
01:17:26,112 --> 01:17:27,646
to me.

1051
01:17:33,419 --> 01:17:37,123
The only way you're getting
to Exegol is with me.

1052
01:17:38,659 --> 01:17:40,024
No!

1053
01:18:12,992 --> 01:18:16,129
Leia knows
what must be done, Artoo.

1054
01:18:16,896 --> 01:18:19,130
To reach her son now...

1055
01:18:19,132 --> 01:18:22,835
will take all the strength
she has left.

1056
01:18:42,889 --> 01:18:44,290
Rey!

1057
01:18:46,459 --> 01:18:47,994
Rey!

1058
01:18:49,462 --> 01:18:50,863
No!

1059
01:19:23,697 --> 01:19:25,996
No, we can't follow them!

1060
01:19:25,998 --> 01:19:28,067
- I can't leave her!
- We can't!

1061
01:19:28,736 --> 01:19:30,203
Rey!

1062
01:21:08,067 --> 01:21:10,069
Ben.

1063
01:21:40,299 --> 01:21:41,300
Leia.

1064
01:22:59,345 --> 01:23:01,715
I did want
to take your hand.

1065
01:23:03,182 --> 01:23:04,785
Ben's hand.

1066
01:23:46,893 --> 01:23:50,262
Goodbye, dear princess.

1067
01:24:01,708 --> 01:24:03,975
Poe,
something's happened.

1068
01:24:03,977 --> 01:24:05,509
- Finn.
- This can't wait.

1069
01:24:05,511 --> 01:24:07,480
We've gotta see
the General.

1070
01:24:09,248 --> 01:24:10,449
She's gone.

1071
01:24:16,555 --> 01:24:17,856
Chewie...

1072
01:24:43,249 --> 01:24:44,685
Hey, kid.

1073
01:25:05,772 --> 01:25:07,005
I miss you, son.

1074
01:25:10,110 --> 01:25:11,375
Your son is dead.

1075
01:25:12,746 --> 01:25:13,814
No.

1076
01:25:18,785 --> 01:25:20,987
Kylo Ren is dead.

1077
01:25:23,222 --> 01:25:24,858
My son is alive.

1078
01:25:29,830 --> 01:25:31,898
You're just a memory.

1079
01:25:33,365 --> 01:25:35,301
Your memory.

1080
01:25:39,271 --> 01:25:40,807
Come home.

1081
01:25:42,008 --> 01:25:43,542
It's too late.

1082
01:25:46,378 --> 01:25:47,814
She's gone.

1083
01:25:49,950 --> 01:25:52,717
Your mother's gone.

1084
01:25:52,719 --> 01:25:55,554
But what she stood for,
what she fought for...

1085
01:25:57,023 --> 01:25:58,524
that's not gone.

1086
01:26:05,065 --> 01:26:06,831
Ben.

1087
01:26:06,833 --> 01:26:08,532
I know
what I have to do...

1088
01:26:08,534 --> 01:26:10,536
but I don't know if I have
the strength to do it.

1089
01:26:20,881 --> 01:26:22,616
You do.

1090
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:34,928
Dad...

1091
01:26:40,399 --> 01:26:42,301
I know.

1092
01:27:02,856 --> 01:27:07,125
<i>The Princess of Alderaan
has disrupted my plan...</i>

1093
01:27:07,127 --> 01:27:11,528
<i>but her foolish act
will be in vain.</i>

1094
01:27:11,530 --> 01:27:15,534
<i>Come to me on Exegol,
General Pryde.</i>

1095
01:27:17,737 --> 01:27:20,305
As I served you
in the old wars,

1096
01:27:20,307 --> 01:27:21,973
I serve you now.

1097
01:27:21,975 --> 01:27:26,410
<i>Send a ship
to a world they know.</i>

1098
01:27:26,412 --> 01:27:28,980
<i>Let it burn.</i>

1099
01:27:28,982 --> 01:27:31,582
<i>The Final Order begins.</i>

1100
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:36,221
<i>She will come,
her friends will follow.</i>

1101
01:27:36,223 --> 01:27:37,657
Yes, my lord.

1102
01:27:47,801 --> 01:27:50,837
Levels
holding steady at 85%.

1103
01:27:52,072 --> 01:27:54,105
Captain.

1104
01:27:54,107 --> 01:27:56,575
- Kijimi is in range.
- Fire.

1105
01:28:15,762 --> 01:28:19,364
<i>Kijimi? How?</i>

1106
01:28:19,366 --> 01:28:21,833
A blast
from a Star Destroyer.

1107
01:28:22,736 --> 01:28:24,534
A ship from
the new Sith fleet.

1108
01:28:24,536 --> 01:28:26,104
Out of the Unknowns.

1109
01:28:26,106 --> 01:28:28,640
The Emperor sent a ship
from Exegol.

1110
01:28:28,642 --> 01:28:30,241
Does that mean every ship
in the fleet...

1111
01:28:30,243 --> 01:28:32,879
Has planet-killing weapons.
Of course they do.

1112
01:28:33,512 --> 01:28:35,246
All of them.

1113
01:28:35,248 --> 01:28:37,048
This is how he finishes it.

1114
01:28:37,050 --> 01:28:38,482
Listen.

1115
01:28:38,484 --> 01:28:40,385
It's on every frequency.

1116
01:28:42,088 --> 01:28:44,322
"The Resistance is dead.

1117
01:28:44,324 --> 01:28:46,159
"The Sith flame will burn.

1118
01:28:47,193 --> 01:28:50,361
"All worlds,
surrender or die.

1119
01:28:50,363 --> 01:28:53,264
"The Final Order begins."

1120
01:28:53,266 --> 01:28:54,834
Leia made you acting general.

1121
01:28:56,169 --> 01:28:57,671
What now?

1122
01:29:06,179 --> 01:29:08,447
I gotta tell you,
I don't really know...

1123
01:29:09,316 --> 01:29:10,850
how to do this.

1124
01:29:12,319 --> 01:29:13,987
What you did...

1125
01:29:15,956 --> 01:29:17,556
I'm not ready.

1126
01:29:18,792 --> 01:29:20,492
Neither were we.

1127
01:29:23,730 --> 01:29:25,932
Luke, Han, Leia, me...

1128
01:29:26,666 --> 01:29:28,001
Who's ever ready?

1129
01:29:28,567 --> 01:29:29,869
How'd you do it?

1130
01:29:31,570 --> 01:29:35,073
Defeat an empire
with almost nothing.

1131
01:29:35,075 --> 01:29:36,643
We had each other.

1132
01:29:37,644 --> 01:29:39,545
That's how we won.

1133
01:29:42,816 --> 01:29:44,682
Hey, don't touch that.
That's my friend's.

1134
01:29:44,684 --> 01:29:46,820
Sorry.
She is gone?

1135
01:29:47,586 --> 01:29:48,820
Yeah, she's gone.

1136
01:29:48,822 --> 01:29:50,090
I don't know where.

1137
01:29:51,157 --> 01:29:52,522
I miss her.

1138
01:29:52,524 --> 01:29:53,793
I miss her, too.

1139
01:29:56,595 --> 01:29:58,162
So, what's your name?

1140
01:29:58,164 --> 01:29:59,664
I gotta talk to you
about something.

1141
01:29:59,666 --> 01:30:00,832
I gotta talk to you
about something.

1142
01:30:00,834 --> 01:30:02,433
I can't do this alone.

1143
01:30:02,435 --> 01:30:03,935
I need you in command
with me.

1144
01:30:03,937 --> 01:30:05,970
This droid has...
Thank you. I appreciate that.

1145
01:30:05,972 --> 01:30:07,338
- General.
- General.

1146
01:30:07,340 --> 01:30:09,307
This droid has a ton
of information about Exegol.

1147
01:30:09,309 --> 01:30:11,075
- Wait, what? Cone-face?
- I am D-O.

1148
01:30:11,077 --> 01:30:12,176
Sorry, D-O.

1149
01:30:12,178 --> 01:30:14,645
He was going to Exegol
with Ochi of Bestoon.

1150
01:30:14,647 --> 01:30:16,147
Why was Ochi going there?

1151
01:30:16,149 --> 01:30:17,482
To bring the little girl

1152
01:30:17,484 --> 01:30:20,084
he was supposed to take
from Jakku to the Emperor.

1153
01:30:20,086 --> 01:30:22,120
He wanted her alive.

1154
01:31:12,038 --> 01:31:15,775
A Jedi's weapon
deserves more respect.

1155
01:31:17,744 --> 01:31:20,178
Master Skywalker.

1156
01:31:20,180 --> 01:31:22,980
What are you doing?

1157
01:31:22,982 --> 01:31:25,716
I saw myself
on the dark throne.

1158
01:31:25,718 --> 01:31:27,318
I won't let it happen.

1159
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:30,023
I'm never leaving this place.
I'm doing what you did.

1160
01:31:30,723 --> 01:31:32,692
I was wrong.

1161
01:31:33,793 --> 01:31:36,229
It was fear
that kept me here.

1162
01:31:37,730 --> 01:31:39,632
What are you most afraid of?

1163
01:31:44,137 --> 01:31:45,138
Myself.

1164
01:31:48,074 --> 01:31:50,076
Because you're a Palpatine.

1165
01:31:52,412 --> 01:31:54,180
Leia knew it, too.

1166
01:31:55,315 --> 01:31:56,783
She didn't tell me.

1167
01:32:03,957 --> 01:32:06,624
She still trained me.

1168
01:32:06,626 --> 01:32:09,494
Because she saw
your spirit.

1169
01:32:09,496 --> 01:32:11,131
Your heart.

1170
01:32:14,033 --> 01:32:15,068
Rey.

1171
01:32:16,202 --> 01:32:19,670
Some things are stronger
than blood.

1172
01:32:19,672 --> 01:32:23,307
Confronting fear
is the destiny of a Jedi.

1173
01:32:23,309 --> 01:32:25,009
Your destiny.

1174
01:32:25,011 --> 01:32:27,145
If you don't face
Palpatine...

1175
01:32:27,147 --> 01:32:29,382
it will mean the end
of the Jedi.

1176
01:32:30,817 --> 01:32:32,852
And the war will be lost.

1177
01:32:36,322 --> 01:32:39,292
There's something my sister
would want you to have.

1178
01:32:54,741 --> 01:32:56,342
Leia's saber.

1179
01:32:58,244 --> 01:33:00,680
It was the last night
of her training.

1180
01:33:17,764 --> 01:33:20,898
<i>Leia told me that she had
sensed the death of her son</i>

1181
01:33:20,900 --> 01:33:24,569
<i>at the end of her Jedi path.</i>

1182
01:33:24,571 --> 01:33:28,573
<i>She surrendered her saber
to me and said that one day...</i>

1183
01:33:28,575 --> 01:33:30,741
it would be picked up
again...

1184
01:33:30,743 --> 01:33:33,846
by someone who would
finish her journey.

1185
01:33:35,715 --> 01:33:39,185
A thousand generations
live in you now.

1186
01:33:40,053 --> 01:33:43,154
But this is your fight.

1187
01:33:43,156 --> 01:33:46,059
You'll take both sabers
to Exegol.

1188
01:33:48,361 --> 01:33:49,760
I can't get there.

1189
01:33:49,762 --> 01:33:52,698
I don't have the wayfinder.
I destroyed Ren's ship.

1190
01:33:52,700 --> 01:33:55,235
You have everything you need.

1191
01:34:05,378 --> 01:34:06,777
Two were made.

1192
01:35:03,136 --> 01:35:08,139
Oh, hello. I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

1193
01:35:08,141 --> 01:35:10,508
And you are?

1194
01:35:10,510 --> 01:35:13,044
What?

1195
01:35:13,046 --> 01:35:15,246
Well, I am quite certain
I would remember

1196
01:35:15,248 --> 01:35:16,782
if I had a best friend.

1197
01:35:18,217 --> 01:35:20,084
You want to put what
in my head?

1198
01:35:20,086 --> 01:35:21,521
Under no circumstances...

1199
01:35:24,625 --> 01:35:27,626
Memory restoration complete.

1200
01:35:27,628 --> 01:35:29,293
Artoo, have you heard?

1201
01:35:29,295 --> 01:35:32,096
I am going with Mistress Rey
on her very first mission.

1202
01:35:33,399 --> 01:35:36,067
I already have?

1203
01:35:36,069 --> 01:35:38,271
Picking up a signal?
From whom?

1204
01:35:44,143 --> 01:35:46,678
All the information you need
for an airstrike on Exegol.

1205
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:47,945
Yeah, except
how to get there.

1206
01:35:47,947 --> 01:35:48,979
Are you seeing
these atmo readings?

1207
01:35:48,981 --> 01:35:50,047
It's a mess out there.

1208
01:35:50,049 --> 01:35:51,215
Magnetic crossfields.

1209
01:35:51,217 --> 01:35:52,950
Gravity wells,
solar winds.

1210
01:35:52,952 --> 01:35:54,185
How does a fleet
even take off from there?

1211
01:35:54,187 --> 01:35:55,386
Terribly sorry.

1212
01:35:55,388 --> 01:35:56,854
I'm afraid
Artoo's memory bank

1213
01:35:56,856 --> 01:35:59,390
must be crossed
with his logic receptors.

1214
01:35:59,392 --> 01:36:02,560
He says he is receiving
a transmission from

1215
01:36:02,562 --> 01:36:03,896
Master Luke.

1216
01:36:04,597 --> 01:36:06,199
That's an old craft ID.

1217
01:36:07,066 --> 01:36:09,033
That's Luke Skywalker's
X-wing.

1218
01:36:09,035 --> 01:36:11,135
It's transmitting
course marker signals

1219
01:36:11,137 --> 01:36:13,037
on its way
to the Unknown Regions.

1220
01:36:13,039 --> 01:36:14,372
It's Rey.

1221
01:36:18,911 --> 01:36:20,513
<i>She's going to Exegol.</i>

1222
01:36:25,151 --> 01:36:26,584
She's showing us.

1223
01:36:26,586 --> 01:36:28,454
She's showing us
how to get there.

1224
01:36:30,490 --> 01:36:32,657
Then we go together.

1225
01:36:37,964 --> 01:36:40,632
Come on, buddy,
we need you.

1226
01:36:40,634 --> 01:36:43,467
<i>As long as those
Star Destroyers are on Exegol</i>

1227
01:36:43,469 --> 01:36:44,568
we can hit them.

1228
01:36:44,570 --> 01:36:45,604
Hit them how?

1229
01:36:45,606 --> 01:36:46,937
They can't activate
their shields

1230
01:36:46,939 --> 01:36:48,339
until they leave atmosphere.

1231
01:36:48,341 --> 01:36:49,674
Which isn't easy on Exegol.

1232
01:36:49,676 --> 01:36:51,643
Ships that size
need help taking off.

1233
01:36:51,645 --> 01:36:53,477
Nav can't tell
which way's up out there.

1234
01:36:53,479 --> 01:36:55,012
So, how do the ships
take off?

1235
01:36:55,014 --> 01:36:56,815
They use a signal
from a navigation tower,

1236
01:36:56,817 --> 01:36:58,418
like this one.

1237
01:36:59,118 --> 01:37:00,351
Except they won't.

1238
01:37:00,353 --> 01:37:01,820
Air team's gonna
find the tower,

1239
01:37:01,822 --> 01:37:03,254
ground team's
gonna blast it.

1240
01:37:03,256 --> 01:37:05,022
- Ground team?
- I have an idea for that.

1241
01:37:05,024 --> 01:37:07,024
Once the tower's down,
the fleet will be stuck in atmo...

1242
01:37:07,026 --> 01:37:08,125
for just minutes,

1243
01:37:08,127 --> 01:37:09,960
with no shields,
and no way out.

1244
01:37:09,962 --> 01:37:11,195
We think hitting the cannons

1245
01:37:11,197 --> 01:37:13,164
might ignite
the main reactors.

1246
01:37:13,166 --> 01:37:14,666
That's our chance.

1247
01:37:14,668 --> 01:37:16,534
We need to pull
some Holdo maneuvers.

1248
01:37:16,536 --> 01:37:17,903
Do some real damage.

1249
01:37:17,905 --> 01:37:19,638
Come on.
That move is one in a million.

1250
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:21,038
Fighters and freighters
can take out their cannons

1251
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:22,462
if there are enough of us.

1252
01:37:22,464 --> 01:37:24,040
There aren't enough of us!

1253
01:37:24,042 --> 01:37:26,143
He's right. We'd be
no more than bugs to them.

1254
01:37:26,145 --> 01:37:28,212
That's where Lando
and Chewie come in.

1255
01:37:28,214 --> 01:37:30,514
They'll take the <i>Falcon</i>
to the Core Systems.

1256
01:37:30,516 --> 01:37:32,983
Send out a call for help
for anybody listening.

1257
01:37:32,985 --> 01:37:34,318
We've got friends
out there.

1258
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:35,953
They'll come if they
know there's hope.

1259
01:37:37,590 --> 01:37:39,557
They will.

1260
01:37:39,559 --> 01:37:42,495
First Order wins by making
us think we're alone.

1261
01:37:43,129 --> 01:37:45,095
We're not alone.

1262
01:37:45,097 --> 01:37:47,668
Good people will fight
if we lead them.

1263
01:37:50,771 --> 01:37:53,204
<i>Leia never gave up.</i>

1264
01:37:53,206 --> 01:37:55,707
<i>And neither will we.</i>

1265
01:37:55,709 --> 01:37:58,110
<i>We're gonna show them
we're not afraid.</i>

1266
01:38:02,448 --> 01:38:05,115
<i>What our mothers
and fathers fought for...</i>

1267
01:38:05,117 --> 01:38:07,153
<i>we will not let die.</i>

1268
01:38:09,623 --> 01:38:10,757
<i>Not today.</i>

1269
01:38:12,124 --> 01:38:14,761
<i>Today, we make
our last stand.</i>

1270
01:38:15,561 --> 01:38:17,196
<i>For the galaxy.</i>

1271
01:38:19,031 --> 01:38:20,399
<i>For Leia.</i>

1272
01:38:23,102 --> 01:38:24,771
For everyone we've lost.

1273
01:38:26,005 --> 01:38:27,774
They've taken enough of us.

1274
01:38:28,709 --> 01:38:30,777
Now we take the war to them.

1275
01:38:57,403 --> 01:38:58,937
<i>She's on approach.</i>

1276
01:38:58,939 --> 01:39:01,773
<i>All ships rise
to deployment altitude.</i>

1277
01:39:41,715 --> 01:39:43,514
I know
it's a rough ride...

1278
01:39:43,516 --> 01:39:45,082
but stay locked
on Rey's course.

1279
01:39:51,758 --> 01:39:53,625
<i>Clear run frequency.</i>

1280
01:39:53,627 --> 01:39:55,994
<i>Captain, we have
Resistance craft incoming.</i>

1281
01:39:55,996 --> 01:39:57,161
Allegiant General...

1282
01:39:57,163 --> 01:39:58,531
<i>Use ion cannons!</i>

1283
01:40:03,937 --> 01:40:05,338
Look at that fleet.

1284
01:40:08,609 --> 01:40:09,610
Damn it!

1285
01:40:11,310 --> 01:40:12,646
Welcome to Exegol.

1286
01:40:16,148 --> 01:40:18,449
Watch your starboard, Wexley!

1287
01:40:18,451 --> 01:40:20,685
- Whoa!
- Get to their altitude.

1288
01:40:20,687 --> 01:40:22,789
They can't fire on us
without hitting each other.

1289
01:40:23,857 --> 01:40:25,289
Don't give up.

1290
01:40:25,291 --> 01:40:26,827
Help is coming.

1291
01:40:28,127 --> 01:40:29,326
There it is.

1292
01:40:29,328 --> 01:40:31,128
Poe, I see it.

1293
01:40:31,130 --> 01:40:32,431
I've got a visual
on the tower.

1294
01:41:21,313 --> 01:41:23,148
- Incoming TIEs!
- I see 'em!

1295
01:41:23,150 --> 01:41:24,350
I got you, Finn.

1296
01:41:28,587 --> 01:41:30,589
- You ready back there?
- Never been readier.

1297
01:41:32,926 --> 01:41:34,993
They're targeting
the navigation tower...

1298
01:41:34,995 --> 01:41:36,226
so the fleet can't deploy.

1299
01:41:36,228 --> 01:41:37,629
Then we won't use
that tower.

1300
01:41:37,631 --> 01:41:39,396
Switch over the source
of navigation signal

1301
01:41:39,398 --> 01:41:40,665
to this ship.

1302
01:41:40,667 --> 01:41:42,602
We'll guide
the fleet out ourselves.

1303
01:41:48,507 --> 01:41:50,809
The navigation tower
has been deactivated.

1304
01:41:50,811 --> 01:41:52,744
- What?
- Those ships need that signal.

1305
01:41:52,746 --> 01:41:54,411
It's gotta be coming
from somewhere.

1306
01:41:54,413 --> 01:41:56,181
<i>They figured out
what we're doing.</i>

1307
01:41:56,183 --> 01:41:58,149
<i>Call off the ground invasion.</i>

1308
01:41:58,151 --> 01:42:00,451
Wait.

1309
01:42:00,453 --> 01:42:02,787
The nav signal's coming
from that command ship.

1310
01:42:02,789 --> 01:42:04,421
That's our drop zone.

1311
01:42:04,423 --> 01:42:05,759
How do you know?

1312
01:42:06,693 --> 01:42:07,625
A feeling.

1313
01:42:07,627 --> 01:42:09,426
You wanna launch
a ground invasion

1314
01:42:09,428 --> 01:42:10,762
on a Star Destroyer?

1315
01:42:10,764 --> 01:42:12,262
I don't want to,
but we can't take out

1316
01:42:12,264 --> 01:42:13,464
that ship's nav system
from the air.

1317
01:42:13,466 --> 01:42:14,899
Give us cover.

1318
01:42:14,901 --> 01:42:16,300
We gotta keep that fleet
there till help arrives.

1319
01:42:16,302 --> 01:42:17,704
- We hope.
- We hope.

1320
01:42:18,972 --> 01:42:20,304
You heard the General.

1321
01:42:20,306 --> 01:42:22,909
All Wings,
cover that lander.

1322
01:42:27,580 --> 01:42:29,748
They've landed
a troop carrier.

1323
01:42:29,750 --> 01:42:31,783
- Jam the speeders.
- I can't, sir.

1324
01:42:31,785 --> 01:42:32,786
Why not?

1325
01:42:33,620 --> 01:42:34,955
They're not using speeders.

1326
01:42:40,761 --> 01:42:42,361
Not bad
for one lesson.

1327
01:42:43,196 --> 01:42:44,798
You had a good teacher!

1328
01:42:52,239 --> 01:42:53,439
Keep going!

1329
01:42:58,979 --> 01:43:00,477
You're doing great, buddy!

1330
01:43:00,479 --> 01:43:02,281
The tower's up ahead.

1331
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:09,749
Long have I waited.

1332
01:44:19,626 --> 01:44:23,763
For my grandchild
to come home.

1333
01:44:26,032 --> 01:44:28,666
I never wanted you dead.

1334
01:44:28,668 --> 01:44:31,468
I wanted you here...

1335
01:44:31,470 --> 01:44:33,807
Empress Palpatine.

1336
01:44:36,243 --> 01:44:38,144
You will take the throne.

1337
01:44:40,814 --> 01:44:45,415
It is your birthright
to rule here.

1338
01:44:45,417 --> 01:44:49,187
It is in your blood.
Our blood.

1339
01:44:50,824 --> 01:44:53,725
I haven't come
to lead the Sith...

1340
01:44:53,727 --> 01:44:55,492
I have come
to end them.

1341
01:44:55,494 --> 01:44:57,561
As a Jedi?

1342
01:44:57,563 --> 01:45:00,198
- Yes.
- No.

1343
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:04,269
Your hatred, your anger.

1344
01:45:04,271 --> 01:45:06,740
You want to kill me.

1345
01:45:08,041 --> 01:45:10,043
That is what I want.

1346
01:45:11,443 --> 01:45:13,011
Kill me...

1347
01:45:13,013 --> 01:45:16,681
and my spirit
will pass into you.

1348
01:45:16,683 --> 01:45:20,517
As all the Sith
live in me...

1349
01:45:20,519 --> 01:45:23,487
you will be Empress...

1350
01:45:23,489 --> 01:45:25,725
we will be one.

1351
01:45:33,099 --> 01:45:35,166
Those thrusters are hot.
How are we doing?

1352
01:45:35,168 --> 01:45:37,735
We're gonna blow our way in,
and take out that nav tower.

1353
01:45:37,737 --> 01:45:39,270
All the hatches
are blast-proof!

1354
01:45:39,272 --> 01:45:40,705
All right, BB-8,
you're up!

1355
01:45:40,707 --> 01:45:42,142
I'll cover you.

1356
01:46:09,936 --> 01:46:12,070
This should do it.

1357
01:46:23,750 --> 01:46:25,185
There it goes.

1358
01:46:26,552 --> 01:46:27,986
Nice one, Finn.

1359
01:46:27,988 --> 01:46:30,188
Nav signal's down,
but not for long.

1360
01:46:30,190 --> 01:46:31,624
We're offline, sir.

1361
01:46:32,591 --> 01:46:34,158
Reset the navigation signal!

1362
01:46:34,160 --> 01:46:35,195
Minutes away, sir.

1363
01:46:36,863 --> 01:46:39,030
- Finn, let's go!
- No, no, wait, listen.

1364
01:46:39,032 --> 01:46:40,331
The crown cannons
have stopped.

1365
01:46:40,333 --> 01:46:41,466
They're resetting
their systems.

1366
01:46:41,468 --> 01:46:44,170
- So?
- I gotta go do something.

1367
01:46:44,804 --> 01:46:46,572
I'm staying with you.

1368
01:46:48,574 --> 01:46:50,174
Still no <i>Falcon</i> or backup.

1369
01:46:51,478 --> 01:46:54,779
I don't know, Artoo.
Maybe nobody else is coming.

1370
01:46:54,781 --> 01:46:55,982
What do we do, General?

1371
01:46:57,017 --> 01:46:58,816
We gotta hit them ourselves.

1372
01:46:58,818 --> 01:46:59,951
What can we do
against these things?

1373
01:46:59,953 --> 01:47:01,921
<i>Just stay alive!</i>

1374
01:47:04,157 --> 01:47:06,525
The time has come!

1375
01:47:16,069 --> 01:47:19,804
With your hatred,
you will take my life.

1376
01:47:19,806 --> 01:47:21,908
And you will ascend.

1377
01:47:23,209 --> 01:47:26,813
All you want is for me
to hate, but I won't.

1378
01:47:27,480 --> 01:47:28,948
Not even you.

1379
01:47:29,849 --> 01:47:33,153
Weak.
Like your parents.

1380
01:47:34,421 --> 01:47:36,156
My parents were strong.

1381
01:47:36,956 --> 01:47:39,157
They saved me from you.

1382
01:47:39,159 --> 01:47:43,761
Your Master, Luke Skywalker,
was saved by his father.

1383
01:47:43,763 --> 01:47:47,333
The only family
you have here...

1384
01:47:47,967 --> 01:47:49,202
is me.

1385
01:48:10,323 --> 01:48:13,724
They don't have long.

1386
01:48:13,726 --> 01:48:17,261
<i>No one is coming
to help them.</i>

1387
01:48:17,263 --> 01:48:21,234
<i>And you are the one
who led them here.</i>

1388
01:48:22,368 --> 01:48:26,037
<i>Strike me down.
Take the throne.</i>

1389
01:48:26,039 --> 01:48:28,406
<i>Reign over the new Empire...</i>

1390
01:48:28,408 --> 01:48:31,277
<i>and the fleet will be yours.</i>

1391
01:48:32,879 --> 01:48:36,950
<i>Only you have the power
to save them.</i>

1392
01:48:38,985 --> 01:48:43,756
<i>Refuse,
and your new family...</i>

1393
01:48:44,591 --> 01:48:46,626
dies.

1394
01:49:04,544 --> 01:49:06,179
Good.

1395
01:49:17,390 --> 01:49:18,858
Ow.

1396
01:49:21,761 --> 01:49:25,129
Finn, where are you?
The lander's leaving.

1397
01:49:25,131 --> 01:49:27,765
- <i>Finn!</i>
- Go without us.

1398
01:49:27,767 --> 01:49:29,702
We're taking
this entire ship down.

1399
01:49:31,371 --> 01:49:32,870
What? How?

1400
01:49:32,872 --> 01:49:34,340
<i>We're gonna hit
the command deck.</i>

1401
01:49:35,275 --> 01:49:38,044
Rose, please. Go.

1402
01:49:39,613 --> 01:49:41,712
- Rose!
- Rose!

1403
01:49:41,714 --> 01:49:43,349
I'll get the trigger!

1404
01:49:45,818 --> 01:49:48,386
The ritual begins.

1405
01:49:49,722 --> 01:49:51,956
She will strike me down...

1406
01:49:51,958 --> 01:49:55,426
and pledge herself
as a Sith.

1407
01:50:15,782 --> 01:50:18,282
<i>She will draw her weapon.</i>

1408
01:50:20,954 --> 01:50:23,487
She will come to me.

1409
01:50:36,903 --> 01:50:39,237
She will take her revenge.

1410
01:50:45,646 --> 01:50:48,579
And with a stroke
of her saber...

1411
01:50:48,581 --> 01:50:51,449
the Sith are reborn!

1412
01:50:52,620 --> 01:50:55,388
The Jedi are dead!

1413
01:51:16,677 --> 01:51:17,842
Do it!

1414
01:51:17,844 --> 01:51:20,213
Make the sacrifice!

1415
01:52:29,717 --> 01:52:33,551
Stand together,
die together.

1416
01:52:42,763 --> 01:52:45,898
The lifeforce of your bond...

1417
01:52:48,134 --> 01:52:51,770
a dyad in the Force.

1418
01:52:51,772 --> 01:52:55,074
A power like life itself.

1419
01:52:55,843 --> 01:52:59,577
Unseen for generations.

1420
01:52:59,579 --> 01:53:01,445
And now...

1421
01:53:01,447 --> 01:53:07,987
the power of two restores
the one, true Emperor.

1422
01:53:29,275 --> 01:53:30,541
<i>Snap,
they're on your tail.</i>

1423
01:53:30,543 --> 01:53:31,610
Yeah, I see 'em!

1424
01:53:31,612 --> 01:53:33,645
No, no, no, Snap, Snap!

1425
01:53:33,647 --> 01:53:35,148
No!

1426
01:53:37,383 --> 01:53:39,818
<i>Alpha Three is down.</i>

1427
01:53:39,820 --> 01:53:42,353
<i>They're on my tail!
I can't get...</i>

1428
01:53:42,355 --> 01:53:44,157
<i>They're everywhere!</i>

1429
01:53:45,591 --> 01:53:47,460
<i>Delta leader's hit!</i>

1430
01:53:48,194 --> 01:53:49,593
<i>Losing altitude!</i>

1431
01:53:49,595 --> 01:53:51,395
<i>General,
what's our next move?</i>

1432
01:53:51,397 --> 01:53:53,597
<i>Poe, what now?</i>

1433
01:53:53,599 --> 01:53:55,001
My friends...

1434
01:53:57,403 --> 01:53:58,571
I'm sorry.

1435
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:01,441
I thought we had a shot.

1436
01:54:03,142 --> 01:54:06,110
But there's just
too many of them.

1437
01:54:06,112 --> 01:54:08,747
<i>But there are
more of us, Poe.</i>

1438
01:54:08,749 --> 01:54:10,583
<i>There are more of us.</i>

1439
01:54:21,628 --> 01:54:23,662
Look at this.

1440
01:54:23,664 --> 01:54:25,298
Look at this.

1441
01:54:34,006 --> 01:54:37,009
Lando, you did it.
You did it!

1442
01:54:39,178 --> 01:54:40,578
Hit those underbelly cannons.

1443
01:54:40,580 --> 01:54:43,182
Every one we knock out
is a world saved.

1444
01:54:46,118 --> 01:54:47,487
Nice flying, Lando.

1445
01:54:57,664 --> 01:54:59,497
We have a ship down.
We lost a Destroyer.

1446
01:54:59,499 --> 01:55:01,098
Systems not responding.

1447
01:55:01,100 --> 01:55:02,233
Where did they get
all these fighter craft?

1448
01:55:02,235 --> 01:55:03,467
They have no navy.

1449
01:55:03,469 --> 01:55:06,506
It's not a navy, sir,
it's just people.

1450
01:55:17,316 --> 01:55:19,283
<i>So long, sky trash!</i>

1451
01:55:19,285 --> 01:55:20,551
Who's that flyer?

1452
01:55:20,553 --> 01:55:22,954
<i>Take a guess,
spice runner.</i>

1453
01:55:24,825 --> 01:55:27,694
Ha! Zorii! You made it!

1454
01:55:40,306 --> 01:55:43,742
Look what you have made.

1455
01:56:02,663 --> 01:56:05,931
As once I fell...

1456
01:56:05,933 --> 01:56:10,100
so falls
the last Skywalker.

1457
01:56:17,376 --> 01:56:21,012
Do not fear
that feeble attack...

1458
01:56:21,014 --> 01:56:23,314
my faithful.

1459
01:56:23,316 --> 01:56:27,286
Nothing will stop
the return of the Sith!

1460
01:56:38,999 --> 01:56:40,899
Artoo, my systems
are failing.

1461
01:56:41,969 --> 01:56:43,302
Does anyone copy?

1462
01:57:24,711 --> 01:57:26,379
Be with me.

1463
01:57:31,051 --> 01:57:32,853
Be with me.

1464
01:57:38,357 --> 01:57:40,359
Be with me.

1465
01:57:43,630 --> 01:57:46,898
<i>These are
your final steps, Rey.</i>

1466
01:57:46,900 --> 01:57:49,768
<i>Rise and take them.</i>

1467
01:57:49,770 --> 01:57:51,736
- <i>Rey.</i>
- <i>Rey.</i>

1468
01:57:51,738 --> 01:57:53,138
<i>Rey.</i>

1469
01:57:53,140 --> 01:57:54,873
<i>Bring back
the balance, Rey, as I did.</i>

1470
01:57:54,875 --> 01:57:57,474
<i>In the night,
find the light, Rey.</i>

1471
01:57:57,476 --> 01:57:59,243
<i>You're not alone, Rey.</i>

1472
01:57:59,245 --> 01:58:01,245
<i>Alone never have you been.</i>

1473
01:58:01,247 --> 01:58:04,581
<i>Every Jedi
who ever lived lives in you.</i>

1474
01:58:04,583 --> 01:58:05,850
<i>The Force surrounds you, Rey.</i>

1475
01:58:05,852 --> 01:58:07,251
<i>Let it guide you.</i>

1476
01:58:07,253 --> 01:58:08,787
<i>As it guided us.</i>

1477
01:58:08,789 --> 01:58:10,487
<i>Feel the Force
flowing through you, Rey.</i>

1478
01:58:10,489 --> 01:58:11,856
<i>Let it lift you.</i>

1479
01:58:11,858 --> 01:58:13,590
<i>Rise, Rey.</i>

1480
01:58:13,592 --> 01:58:15,292
<i>We stand behind you, Rey.</i>

1481
01:58:15,294 --> 01:58:16,593
<i>Rey.</i>

1482
01:58:16,595 --> 01:58:18,663
<i>Rise in the Force.</i>

1483
01:58:18,665 --> 01:58:22,600
<i>In the heart of a Jedi
lies her strength.</i>

1484
01:58:22,602 --> 01:58:24,969
- <i>Rise.</i>
- <i>Rise.</i>

1485
01:58:24,971 --> 01:58:30,443
<i>Rey, the Force
will be with you, always.</i>

1486
01:58:48,628 --> 01:58:52,097
Let your death
be the final word...

1487
01:58:52,099 --> 01:58:54,935
in the story of rebellion.

1488
01:59:05,879 --> 01:59:08,179
I'm back on!
This is our last chance.

1489
01:59:08,181 --> 01:59:10,316
We gotta hit
those cannons now!

1490
01:59:14,520 --> 01:59:17,321
You are nothing!

1491
01:59:17,323 --> 01:59:21,661
A scavenger girl is no
match for the power in me.

1492
01:59:24,965 --> 01:59:28,666
I am all the Sith!

1493
01:59:31,337 --> 01:59:33,305
And I...

1494
01:59:38,444 --> 01:59:40,344
I'm all the Jedi.

1495
02:00:30,730 --> 02:00:32,531
Poe, the command ship!

1496
02:00:33,834 --> 02:00:35,566
<i>Their fleet is stuck here!</i>

1497
02:00:35,568 --> 02:00:36,937
They're toast!
Come on!

1498
02:00:40,740 --> 02:00:42,339
Finn, you seeing this?

1499
02:00:42,341 --> 02:00:44,008
Finn didn't board
the lander.

1500
02:00:44,010 --> 02:00:46,343
They're still
on that command ship?

1501
02:00:56,623 --> 02:00:59,657
I see them.
I'm going to get them.

1502
02:00:59,659 --> 02:01:01,226
General,
you won't make it.

1503
02:01:01,228 --> 02:01:02,593
Trust me, I'm fast!

1504
02:01:02,595 --> 02:01:04,631
<i>Not as fast
as this ship.</i>

1505
02:01:07,167 --> 02:01:09,669
Hold on, Chewie!

1506
02:01:19,179 --> 02:01:20,912
Finn!

1507
02:01:56,049 --> 02:01:58,151
No, Rey.

1508
02:04:21,194 --> 02:04:22,729
Ben.

1509
02:05:44,744 --> 02:05:46,346
<i>There, look!</i>

1510
02:05:47,080 --> 02:05:48,614
Red Five is in the air.

1511
02:05:48,616 --> 02:05:50,049
Rey's alive.

1512
02:05:51,684 --> 02:05:53,284
I see her.

1513
02:05:53,286 --> 02:05:56,087
<i>People are rising up
all over the galaxy.</i>

1514
02:05:56,089 --> 02:05:59,357
<i>Poe. We did it.</i>

1515
02:05:59,359 --> 02:06:00,393
We did it.

1516
02:06:56,916 --> 02:06:58,851
Happy.

1517
02:07:02,789 --> 02:07:04,090
Chewie!

1518
02:07:34,722 --> 02:07:35,886
Hi!

1519
02:07:35,888 --> 02:07:37,156
Good job!

1520
02:07:41,861 --> 02:07:43,229
Chewie.

1521
02:07:45,699 --> 02:07:47,800
This is for you.

1522
02:08:06,185 --> 02:08:07,887
Did you hear that?

1523
02:08:34,213 --> 02:08:36,113
Where are you from,
General?

1524
02:08:36,115 --> 02:08:38,151
The Gold system.

1525
02:08:42,723 --> 02:08:44,157
Well, what about you, kid?

1526
02:08:44,792 --> 02:08:46,424
Oh.

1527
02:08:46,426 --> 02:08:47,827
I don't know.

1528
02:08:49,797 --> 02:08:51,531
Well, let's find out.

1529
02:11:31,491 --> 02:11:34,126
There's been no one
for so long.

1530
02:11:34,828 --> 02:11:36,429
Who are you?

1531
02:11:37,931 --> 02:11:39,465
I'm Rey.

1532
02:11:40,634 --> 02:11:41,735
Rey who?

1533
02:12:06,592 --> 02:12:08,094
Rey Skywalker.
