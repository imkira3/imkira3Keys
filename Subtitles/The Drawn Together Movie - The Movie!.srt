00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:18,017
WOMAN: Hey, ass bag! Give me another!

3
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:21,270
Listen, you've run up quite
a tab over the last few weeks.

4
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:24,690
-Why don't you say...
-Another shot, goddamnit!

5
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,443
Hmm. Oh!

6
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:35,868
"Come to the booth in the back.
Act casual, fat ass!"

7
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:38,537
Who the hell is that?

8
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:41,040
Please, don't cause any more
trouble around here, Miss...

9
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:51,341
All right, lady. l don't know
who you think you are, but l...

10
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:52,760
You've been busy.

11
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:54,553
Foxxy.

12
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:57,890
What the hell are you doing here?
We can't be seen together!

13
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:59,349
You'll get us killed!

14
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:00,893
Toot, you've got to come with me.

15
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:02,895
You're not safe here anymore, fatty.

16
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,396
What the hell do you care?

17
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:07,357
You're the reason we're in this mess, Foxxy.

18
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:09,568
lf that's even your real name.

19
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:11,737
Of course it's my real name.

20
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:14,907
You don't know that!
You don't know anything.

21
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,575
l know this.

22
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:27,377
l deserved that.

23
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,630
You deserve to die.

24
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:34,093
Toot, l can't change the past,
but l can change the future.

25
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,595
l met somebody who could
help us get our lives back!

26
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:39,389
Oh, yeah? Well, l've met someone, too.

27
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:42,267
l've met a man who loves me for me,

28
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,436
a man who's willing to cheat on his wife

29
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:48,607
because he's a closeted homosexual
who thinks l'm a man!

30
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:52,319
A man who refers to my vagina
as a manhole.

31
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,530
Toot, Clara's dead!

32
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:57,574
Clara? She... She's...

33
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,993
Dead, yes. l sorry.

34
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,956
Oh, my God! l can't believe it!

35
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,251
She was so... So...

36
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,086
Now which one was Clara again?

37
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:12,381
She wasn't that little fugly
battle monster thing, was she?

38
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:13,507
No, the princess.

39
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,676
How'd she die?

40
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,262
The same way we all gonna die!

41
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:19,513
l.S.R.A.E.L. !

42
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,932
l.S.R.A.E.L.?

43
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:24,309
That's why you need to
come with me before it's too...

44
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:29,898
Your location's been compromised!
Get out of there now!

45
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,234
-We gots to go!
-Forget it, Foxxy.

46
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,735
l'm not... Aah!

47
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,071
Goddamnit! They followed you here!

48
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,739
Head towards the back of the bar!

49
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,747
Take a right! Go up the stairs!

50
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,461
What now, Wooldoor?

51
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,672
Oh, is that Wooldoor? Tell him l said hi!

52
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:56,300
Oh, hey, Toot
how you doin'? Go straight!

53
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,260
Straight? But we on the roof!

54
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,803
Just do it!

55
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,307
Wait, what are you doing?

56
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:06,185
Stop! l can't fly without my feather!

57
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,278
The key's got to be here somewhere.

58
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:22,034
Come on, come on, come on, come on!
We're gonna die!

59
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:25,621
Got 'em! Let's go!

60
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,048
Ah, we made it.

61
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,383
Hey, Toot, baby. Where you goin'...

62
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,551
Aah! Ooh!

63
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,973
Stop, stop! That's the man l love!

64
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,934
We can't! There's no time!

65
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,811
Barney!

66
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,076
Huzzah!

67
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,455
Hey, hey, hey.

68
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,499
Great googly moogly!

69
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,959
Whee!

70
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,877
Don't make me suck your dick!

71
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,754
Guys, you suck.

72
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,589
l love racism!

73
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,258
A Jew in our backyard!

74
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,426
Ooh, l like that bitch!

75
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,345
Flavor flav!

76
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,055
Up the butt?

77
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,223
Goddamnit!

78
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,267
l cut myself!

79
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,851
Surprise!

80
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,521
My special move is the reach around!

81
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:56,044
Ahh. Good morning, people and Foxxy.
lt's a lovely day to be on a reality show.

82
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,256
And it's a great day to deny wetting the bed.

83
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,549
Which l did not do!

84
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:05,387
Ooh, it's also the perfect day to
stay in bed and snuggle all day!

85
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:11,810
Hey, we should have
another piñata party tonight!

86
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:14,354
But, uh, this time we should get a real piñata.

87
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:20,027
Guys, there really is nothing better
than being on a reality television show!

88
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,653
Nothing!

89
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,155
-Attention, housemates.
-Ooh.

90
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,990
This is the Jew Producer speaking.

91
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,743
Please report to the living room
for the next competition.

92
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:31,038
Competition? Ooh!
Wait up, guys, l'm almost ready.

93
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:37,127
Now l'm ready. Whee!

94
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,129
Good morning, housemates.

95
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:42,466
Today's competition is
pretty self-explanatory.

96
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,675
lt is?

97
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,679
Put on the heels,
step on the puppies and kittens,

98
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:52,017
and the person who crushes the most
by the time l come wins the coveted, uh,

99
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:58,690
l don't know, let's say, uh, immunity from
next week's final judgment ceremony night?

100
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:02,194
Jew Producer,
this competition is ridiculous.

101
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:04,029
lt almost sounds made up.

102
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:06,698
That's why you're going to lose. Suck it!

103
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,075
And go!

104
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,543
l thought l had a good chance to win.

105
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:21,671
l made more bloody fur than
menstruation time at Mount Holyoke.

106
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,096
And it's time!

107
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,931
Ooh! That felt good.

108
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,144
Ehh!

109
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,189
Oh, yeah. You guys did an excellent job.

110
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,399
Oh, oh!

111
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,569
Wait, Jew Producer.
You didn't even tell us who won.

112
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,572
Oh. Um, the winner is, uh,
who hasn't won in a while?

113
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,075
Let's say that guy in shorts there.

114
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:54,329
Congrats. Here's your immunity,
uh, scented candle.

115
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,249
Booya! You can all suck it, bitches.

116
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,918
That's right, number one, numero uno.

117
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,712
Something didn't sit well with the Foxxy.

118
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:07,300
l mean, lately, all the competitions was
about us doing some kind of bull crap

119
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,678
so the Jew Producer could
get his Jew-y rocks off.

120
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,722
l can't be the only one
who thinks these competitions

121
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,891
is completely random and arbitrary.

122
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:19,521
Something ain't right here.
The Foxxy smells herself a mystery.

123
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,651
-What's so funny?
-Come on, Foxxy.

124
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,903
lt's time to give up trying to redeem yourself.

125
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,947
Yeah. For weeks, you've
been trying to make up

126
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,032
for botching that mystery
at the amusement park.

127
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:36,830
Mr. Wilkinson here
denies being a super villain.

128
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:41,001
But let me ask you this,
if you ain't not a super villain,

129
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:44,087
then why would you
need a bulletproof face?

130
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,174
Oh, Henry!

131
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,009
Hang in there, Henry.

132
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:54,055
Don't give up on me, you hear?
Don't you give up on me.

133
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:58,477
lt's not your time yet.
You're a fighter, damn it!

134
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,812
Now fight, fight!

135
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:04,107
Damn! l was 40% sure
he had one of them bulletproof faces.

136
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:09,404
Foxxy Love, you're the worst
mystery-solving musician that's ever lived!

137
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:13,825
Yeah. The only case you ever
cracked was the display case at Zales.

138
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,829
Oh, oh, l got one.

139
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,832
Foxxy, the only thing you're good at
is giving head,

140
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,834
and you managed to do the opposite!

141
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,378
Oh, yeah, good one, Wooldoor!

142
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,756
You, too, Wooldoor?

143
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,299
Oh...

144
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,683
Hey, champ.
l'm sorry about what l said before.

145
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,268
l was just trying to fit in.

146
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:44,606
Nah, Wooldoor, you was right about me.
l ain't no good at mystery solving.

147
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,690
That's not true.

148
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:49,402
You're the bestest mystery-solving
musician in the whole wide world!

149
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,363
l don't...

150
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,447
Shut the hell up.

151
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:56,117
Foxxy, l brought you a special someone
that l think will really cheer you up!

152
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,702
Papa?

153
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,454
You can come in now!

154
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,165
-Mrs. Wilkins?
Aah!

155
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:07,295
Get her off! Get her off!

156
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,757
Silly Foxxy. Mrs. Wilkins is post-menopausal.

157
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,509
lt's impossible to get her off.

158
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:18,640
You'll pay for what you've done! Damn you!

159
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,935
What the hell is wrong with you, wooddork?

160
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,396
There is no good explanation
for what l've done.

161
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,065
You are clearly out your fuckin' mind!

162
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,567
l'm sorry. l really...

163
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,069
-Did you hear that?
-What?

164
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,613
You out your fuckin' mind!

165
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:37,075
l said "Fuck," and they didn't beep it!

166
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,077
Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

167
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:42,414
What about "Shit"?
What about "Cunt"?

168
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,249
What about "Shitcunt"?

169
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:48,587
No beeps!
They ain't beeping the curse words!

170
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,089
Go on, try it! Say something!

171
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:55,927
Ok. Uh, schwartza. Mud baby.
Smoked lrishmen. lnk face!

172
00:09:56,012 --> 00:10:01,600
Nah, dummy, they never censor racism.
l'm talking about words like shitcunt.

173
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:05,020
Ooh. l could never say that.
Those are bad words.

174
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:08,189
Ooh, if they ain't beeping,
maybe they ain't blurring nothing.

175
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,733
Quick, fool, whip it out!

176
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,610
-What?
-Show me your cock.

177
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,361
l thought you'd never ask.

178
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,864
Whee!

179
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:20,493
Oh, Wooldoor,
you've been holding out on me!

180
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:23,997
Whoa! l've actually never
seen my penis unblurred before.

181
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:26,374
lt's way blacker than l thought it would be.

182
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,127
You know what this means? l was right!

183
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:33,465
There is a mystery to be solved.
And l's gonna solve it.

184
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,008
Thanks, Wooldoor.

185
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:42,098
So, little fella, let's go get you a burger.

186
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,850
Whee!

187
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:47,979
All right, ante up.
Deuces and one-eyed jacks are wild.

188
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:52,317
Wait, Spanky!
We can't start guys' night without Hero.

189
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,822
Well, if l had some mystery hottie,

190
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,659
l wouldn't be hanging around
with you schmendricks, either.

191
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,286
Our special guy time is
far more important to Hero

192
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,163
than being with some cheap floozy

193
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:07,999
who probably doesn't even
secretly eat his toenail clippings,

194
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:11,002
so at least a little part of
Hero can always be inside him.

195
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,424
Never fear! Captain Hero is here!

196
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,844
To play poker with the guys.

197
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,013
Oh! l knew you'd come!

198
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:27,310
Uh, Hero? ls that a dead girl?

199
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:31,147
Oh, hey, everybody, this is Molly.
She's my girlfriend.

200
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,024
Molly, is it ok if l call you my girlfriend?

201
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,527
l know l probably
should have asked you first.

202
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,321
How did we meet, you ask?

203
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,573
Well, it's a tale as old as time.

204
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:43,702
Molly was being held against her will

205
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:47,580
by the evil legion of immediate
family mourners of doom!

206
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,626
Back, you putrid, perverse purveyors of evil!

207
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,170
Captain Hero is here!

208
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:59,551
What? No, ma'am.
You don't need to repay me.

209
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:04,639
My reward is your safety.
A hand job, you say?

210
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:07,726
Well, l guess l do deserve one.

211
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,520
You're different from the others, aren't you?

212
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:12,439
Huzzah!

213
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:20,113
Ok, busted. We met on J-Date.

214
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:25,118
Hero, l can't believe you're doing this to me.

215
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:29,247
You're turning our guys' night
into a guys' nightmare!

216
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:32,500
How dare you! How dare all of you!

217
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:36,254
lf you can't deal with me being happy,
then you're not really my friends!

218
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,423
Come on, Molly, let's get out of here!

219
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:48,600
And so the Foxxy set off to solve the mystery
of why the fuck we wasn't censored no more.

220
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:51,811
And to prove to these
assholes that l was a

221
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,146
serious

222
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,439
mystery solver.

223
00:12:54,523 --> 00:13:00,236
And then, l made the most shocking
discovery of all that explained everything.

224
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,663
Oh, Lordy!

225
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,208
Guys, l solved a mystery.

226
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:17,295
The only mystery you've ever solved
is the mystery of the empty uterus.

227
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:25,011
lf that's true, then how did l found out that
the Drawn Together had been canceled?

228
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:30,517
C-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-
c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-

229
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:36,272
c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-
c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-canceled?

230
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,399
-That's ridiculous!
-Girl, you crazy.

231
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,568
-Poppycock!
-Oh, really?

232
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,905
Then why can l say,
"You can all fuck my titties

233
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:47,492
"with your shit-covered cocks,
you come-guzzling faggots!"

234
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,327
without being beeped?

235
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:55,083
Yeah! How the fuck is...
Whoa! l just said, "fuck!"

236
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,293
Fuck! Oh, well, l'll be darned.

237
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:00,672
Dick-gobbling, blood-soaked,
ass-eating turd taster!

238
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,590
Whoo-hoo! This is fun!

239
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,348
Guys, we are not canceled.

240
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:14,477
This is Foxxy we're dealing with, remember?
The worst mystery solver of all time.

241
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:17,355
Every time she tries to solve a mystery,
someone ends up dead!

242
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:18,773
Fuck you, Clara.

243
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,733
Don't talk to me like that, Jemima-head.

244
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,277
l am a princess.

245
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:27,490
Oh, yeah? Well, if you a princess,
then why you got this chair in your face?

246
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:28,950
Ta-dow!

247
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,667
We can't be canceled. We just can't.

248
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:38,918
Can we?

249
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,478
Searching...

250
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:25,340
Tomorrow, l need you to run downtown
and pick up a new pair of horn sharpeners.

251
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,091
Yes, dear.

252
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:30,595
Hey, after that, Jew Dad,
can we play a little catch?

253
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,932
Of course, Jew Son. Gosh, l love you.

254
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,684
l don't know what l'd do
if anything would happen to you.

255
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:41,689
Oh, how emotionally invested l am
in you staying safe and remaining alive.

256
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,650
As would anyone watching us right now.

257
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,320
-Oh, no.
-Don't you dare answer that.

258
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,572
-lt's shabbat.
-But it's work!

259
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,116
lt must be important
if the boss is calling today.

260
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:56,204
l don't care if it's Moses himself.
Do not answer that.

261
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,373
Uh, l'll be right back.

262
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,546
Dude, l'm not turning
your lights on for you again.

263
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:09,300
No, my cell phone.
Just hit the green button so l can answer it.

264
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,302
l don't see why you
don't just answer it yourself.

265
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,595
lt's forbidden!

266
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,472
God's going to know you asked me to do it.

267
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,307
-No, he won't.
-Of course he will.

268
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,560
Well, then he'll appreciate my
cleverness in getting around his laws.

269
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,730
Now hit send before it goes to voicemail!

270
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,607
Fine. l'll do it.

271
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:28,194
But first, you need to say you accept
Jesus Christ as your lord and savior.

272
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,571
What? Are you insane?

273
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,949
Look, l'm not the one
trying to fool the Almighty here.

274
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:36,452
Now say you accept Jesus Christ,
and l'll answer your phone.

275
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,663
Oh, fine!

276
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:42,959
l accept Jesus Christ as my
lord and savior. Happy now?

277
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:46,379
Yep. Now you can answer
your own damn phone.

278
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:50,174
You're a fucking dick, Eddie!

279
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,430
Hey, boss.

280
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,516
You lied to me, Jew Producer.

281
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,518
What? Uh, no, l would never...

282
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:05,398
You told me after l canceled
Drawn Together, you erased them!

283
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,150
But l did! l swear!

284
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:11,696
Then how come the network
just got a call from one Foxxy Love

285
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,783
asking why no one told
them they were canceled?

286
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:16,909
Busted.

287
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:22,832
By keeping them alive,
you've put us all in great jeopardy.

288
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,043
-Let me explain...
-Too late for that!

289
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:29,255
l am sending a friend of mine
to pay them a little visit.

290
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,007
A friend?

291
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:37,764
Yes! The lntelligent Smart,
Robot Animation Eraser Lady!

292
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:42,101
Otherwise known as l.S.R.A.E.L. !

293
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:45,438
She will erase them all, forever!

294
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:51,986
Please, enjoy the rest of your Sabbath.

295
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,363
Oh, no. This is bad.

296
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,326
l need you to start my car, Eddie.

297
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:06,042
The network keeps transferring me around.

298
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,794
Nobody want to tell me nothing.

299
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:11,589
l can't believe we've been canceled.
l thought our ratings were pretty good.

300
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:15,259
No! No! Without the distraction
of the cameras,

301
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,930
l'll have nothing to keep me
from hearing the voices in my head!

302
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,266
Cut their throats and drink
the children's blood, Wooldoor.

303
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,060
Their youth will be your youth.

304
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,606
Oh, Molly, hold me!

305
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,566
Cup the balls.

306
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,443
-l'd cup.

307
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,237
lf only he'd ask.

308
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:37,573
Oh, who the hell took our goddamn timeslot?

309
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,951
The Suck My Taint Show?

310
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:42,203
Let me info this.

311
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,461
...and taint sucking,
starring the loveable,

312
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,797
poignant Suck My Taint Girl.

313
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,423
We got canceled for that?

314
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,637
Uh, attention, houseguests.
Tonight's competition is...

315
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:02,348
Get in my fucking trunk, or l will shoot you!

316
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,813
Yeah, we know we've been canceled.

317
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:12,608
Shut up, fatty. Now, everyone in my truck.
We're running out of time!

318
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,528
The Jew Producer's right! Toot is fat.

319
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:18,322
Yeah, he's got a point. l am fat.

320
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:23,035
Well, l ain't going nowhere until you tell us
why in the hell we was canceled.

321
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,539
Come on, guys.
Have you ever even seen your show?

322
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:30,668
lt's filthy, it's racist, and it has
a shocking lack of Dave Chappelle.

323
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:33,504
Yeah, he's got a point. l am fat.

324
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:36,716
Now get in my truck!
l'm trying to save you idiots!

325
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,593
Ah, save us from what?

326
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:47,018
From that! lntelligent Smart
Robot Animation Eraser Lady!

327
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:50,354
l.S.R.A.E.L.? Why the fuck is it on
our land when we already live here?

328
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,774
To destroy you all! Now hurry!

329
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,824
Prepare to be erased.

330
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,246
Run!

331
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,757
Holy shit!

332
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:20,009
l.S.R.A.E.L. must kill you all!

333
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,887
Wait, wait, l'm sure
we can work something out!

334
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:25,640
I.S.R.A.E.L. must be
aggressive to survive!

335
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,433
lt's a common sense policy.

336
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,561
Come on, y'all! To the mystery van!

337
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,114
Molly!
She's still in the living room!

338
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:48,663
There's nothing you can do for her!
She's dead!

339
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,164
l've got to try!

340
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,169
Try

341
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,838
He really is delightfully retarded.

342
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:04,178
l'm going to take that l.S.R.A.E.L. out!

343
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,429
Hold on!

344
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,432
Don't come any closer.
l.S.R.A.E.L. has boundary issues.

345
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,309
Kung fu, motherfucker!

346
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,445
l've got to try!

347
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,534
Try

348
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:30,955
Huzzah!

349
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:46,554
Try

350
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:52,435
Oh, no! The Drawn Together house, it's...

351
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:55,021
lt's gone!

352
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,569
Oh, thank God you're ok!

353
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,364
Oh, flick my balls.

354
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,624
Faster, Foxxy!

355
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,501
The l.S.R.A.E.L.'s right behind us!

356
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,670
My kingdom is only a couple miles away.

357
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:20,755
We'll be safe there!

358
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:24,925
No, you can't go home.
None of you can go home, ever again!

359
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,851
You don't understand.
None of you are who you think you are!

360
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:35,061
What?

361
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:39,774
You trying to say l ain't really Foxxy Brown?

362
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:44,236
What l'm trying to say is you're all fakes!
Cheap knock-offs.

363
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:48,449
You're all parodies of the real thing
created just to be on Drawn Together.

364
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:51,702
Now that the show's over,
the boss wants you all destroyed.

365
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,704
-But why would he want...
-Look out!

366
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:02,046
Without you, my life really has no meaning.

367
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:14,141
Where is the Drawn Together gang?
I.S.R.A.E.L. must erase them!

368
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:18,854
They got away.
Looks like you screwed up, l.S.R.A.E.L.

369
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:22,483
You're in so much trouble.

370
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,326
You explain to boss what happened.

371
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:33,744
l.S.R.A.E.L. is sick of being blamed

372
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,497
for every little fucking thing
that goes wrong in the desert.

373
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:37,873
Aah!

374
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:45,047
Oh, God. l was so scared.

375
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,759
l mean, l wanted to go,
"Whee, wee wee wee," all the way home.

376
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:58,894
Never trust a Jew producer.
l'm obviously a real Disney princess.

377
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:02,690
lf l weren't, why would l be so much better
than all of you people and Foxxy?

378
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,943
Maybe that Jew Producer
was telling the truth!

379
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:10,239
l mean, Clara,
you may look like a Disney princess,

380
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:14,869
but how many Disney princesses
have done the things you've done done?

381
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:24,670
And how many times you seen
Josie and the Pussycats do what l doed?

382
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:32,303
Now, Foxxy, let's not
jump to any conclusions here.

383
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,763
Come on, Captain Hero!

384
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:38,726
How many real superheroes
do you know that bang corpses?

385
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,144
l don't know.

386
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:44,148
Molly, how many superheroes
have you been with?

387
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:55,826
ln fact, ain't no real cartoon characters
would do any of the things we done doed!

388
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:59,205
Come to think of it, l don't behave
anything like the real Betty Boop.

389
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:02,208
Ah, please, Toot.
We're trying to have a discussion here!

390
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,960
Yeah, really, Toot.
Don't make this all about you.

391
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:10,424
This is horrible! We're canceled and fake.

392
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,550
Just like my child support checks.

393
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:12,676
-Ta!

394
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:16,096
Oh, yeah, laugh it up, Wooldoor,
but l.S.R.A.E.L.'s after us!

395
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:19,058
No one can hide from l.S.R.A.E.L.
What are we going to do?

396
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:23,729
You heard the Jew Producer.
They want us dead because we's canceled.

397
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:28,692
So if we can get Drawn Together
back on the air, we can save our asses!

398
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:31,904
Yeah, right, Foxxy.
How you plan on doing that?

399
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:33,239
l don't know yet.

400
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:36,534
But we can start with that girl
who stole our timeslot.

401
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:39,370
The Suck My Taint Girl.
She sound like she could help.

402
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:41,664
l am fat.

403
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:44,833
Well, l'm not fake.
So l'm going back to my kingdom.

404
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,544
You're all welcome to join me.

405
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:49,046
My father, the king,
will keep us safe from l.S.R.A.E.L.

406
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,464
l do like being safe.

407
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,385
Molly and l always dreamed
of going to Disneyworld.

408
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:57,304
You said you'd take me to Disneyworld!

409
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,516
Well, like a colostomy bag,
l'm on Foxxy's side.

410
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,977
l liked being a reality TV star.

411
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,895
Yeah! We need to get our show back.

412
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,440
Otherwise, l'll have to go back to
my old gig, exposing myself to children,

413
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:11,777
and that union has the worst health plan!

414
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:16,740
Fine! Then l guess we are splitting up.
How do we decide who gets the mystery van?

415
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,450
Later, ass bags!

416
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:27,459
l'm sorry, sir. l couldn't let you
erase the Drawn Togethergang.

417
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:30,921
They were my creations, and l... l...

418
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,423
l loved them.

419
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:38,220
For Christ sake, Jew Producer!
They must be destroyed!

420
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:43,434
Tell me, boss, why do you
dislike the Drawn Togethergang so?

421
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:48,397
Because, they took my family from me.

422
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:49,523
They did?

423
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:53,319
l've never spoken of this before to anyone,

424
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:59,366
but with l.S.R.A.E.L. by my side,
l guess l feel safe.

425
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:07,124
My beautiful wife was taking our little girl
Sasha to her first day of elementary school.

426
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:09,168
They were singing something.

427
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:12,963
Something pure, something innocent.

428
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:16,258
Little Sasha was young
and hadn't yet been burdened

429
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:20,137
with the complexities and ugliness of life.

430
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:22,056
But then she saw it.

431
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,808
Mommy, Mommy!

432
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:28,103
What is that chocolate-face girl
doing to the princess?

433
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:32,691
No, no, no, no.
Don't look at it, honey. Close your eyes.

434
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,860
For God sakes, close your eyes!

435
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:38,572
Mommy! The chocolate girl is
eating the princess!

436
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:43,410
She's eating her face!
Why is she eating her face?

437
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,578
Mommy!

438
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:50,542
My wife lost control of the car
and drove off a cIiff!

439
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:53,962
They landed in a deadly pit of alligators!

440
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:57,716
Swimming in a pit of sulfuric acid!

441
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:02,930
By the time l arrived,
there was nothing l could do

442
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:07,267
but get revenge!

443
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:09,645
Aah!

444
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:16,652
So, Jew Producer, it's not that l
dislike the Drawn Togethergang.

445
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:21,615
lt's that l hate those motherfuckers!

446
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,617
They took my family from me,

447
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:29,081
and l'll be damned if l let them
take my media empire!

448
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:36,296
Oh...kay. But still, l won't help you!

449
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:41,218
l had a feeling
you would say that.

450
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:42,636
l.S.R.A.E.L. !

451
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,722
Jew Dad?

452
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,348
Jew Son?

453
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:50,561
Dad, l.S.R.A.E.L. forcibly removed me
from the only home l've ever known!

454
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:54,898
You will help l.S.R.A.E.L.,
or you'll feel what it's like

455
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:59,987
when something horrible happens
to your child! You hear me?

456
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,947
Or should l speak up?

457
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,241
Ow! Ah!

458
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:15,210
Ok, ok! l'll find the Drawn Togethergang.
l'll help destroy them!

459
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,296
l.S.R.A.E.L.,

460
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,799
l think the Jew Producer
will be more helpful now.

461
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:25,846
Off you go.
Destroy the Drawn Togethergang forever.

462
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:34,271
l.S.R.A.E.L. has gone nuclear.

463
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:43,113
Oh, it's good to be home.

464
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,073
Hark! Who goes there?

465
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:48,368
Guards, tis l, your Princess Clara.

466
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,329
You may kiss my feet if you like.

467
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:53,248
Oh, and once l'm inside,
you can execute them.

468
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:55,125
Wait, what?

469
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,669
Ha, ha! Just kidding.

470
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:03,967
Do you not know that impersonating
a princess is a serious offense,

471
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,428
punishable by death?

472
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:09,056
Do you not know that sucking my dick
is a serious offense?

473
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,141
-Punishable by fuck you!
-Huh?

474
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,685
Now let us in at once,
or l'll have your children killed.

475
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,313
Yeah, it's good to be home.

476
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:31,662
Princess! Your Highness.

477
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,205
What the... Who the fuck are you?

478
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:35,874
l am the king!

479
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,835
The king? You are not the king.

480
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,296
My father is the king,
which makes me the princess.

481
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:44,424
Father, l think this peasant
has gone mad with the plague!

482
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,970
For everyone knows
l am the true princess of the land.

483
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:53,517
My loyal, filthy subjects,
surely you assholes recognize me.

484
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:56,937
lmposter!

485
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:12,035
Guys? l think the Jew Producer
was telling the truth.

486
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,789
l think l'm a fake.
l think we're all fakes!

487
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,958
Oh, my God. You know what l think?

488
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,127
Duh!

489
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:22,921
To the dungeon with them!

490
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,268
It ain't where it is and it ain't where it ain't

491
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:38,437
lt's a little stinky thing l call a taint

492
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:40,898
Why don't you suck it, why don't you suck it?

493
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,400
Why don't you suck my little taint?

494
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:46,403
It ain't where it was and it taint where it ain't

495
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:48,488
And it's something they call my stinky taint

496
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,074
Why don't you suck it, why don't you suck it?

497
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,744
Why don't you suck it?

498
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:56,788
-What the hell is this?
-This is horrible!

499
00:31:56,873 --> 00:32:00,375
She's a little girl who sings about her taint!

500
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,668
lt's genius!

501
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,671
-Why don't you suck
-Why don't you suck

502
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:09,676
Why don't you suck her stinky little taint?

503
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:12,054
Why don't you suck

504
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:18,936
-Suck my taint
-Suck my taint

505
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,104
Suck my stinky little taint

506
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,565
-Suck my taint
-Taint

507
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:27,069
-Suck my taint
-Suck my taint

508
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:33,200
Come on and suck my stinky little taint

509
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:37,955
lt's the most beautiful thing l've ever seen!

510
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,373
Don't you see?

511
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,751
lt taint corporate greed,
and it taint the politicians

512
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:47,214
who have drained our economy.
lt's the lack of personal responsibility.

513
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,760
-That is so true.
-l never thought of that before.

514
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,470
l normally don't laugh at taint humor,

515
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:55,847
but this is wrapped in
such an important message.

516
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,432
Why don't you suck

517
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:02,145
-Suck my taint
-Suck my taint

518
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,230
Suck my taint

519
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:07,651
And when did it become a crime
to be passionate about your work?

520
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:11,154
So what if l love the characters l created?
Screw him, right?

521
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:15,283
And kidnapping my son, whoo, how tacky.
Not to mention clichè!

522
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:17,494
You don't talk much, do you, l.S.R.A.E.L.?

523
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:20,330
I.S.R.A.E.L. taIks when
l.S.R.A.E.L. has something to say.

524
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,416
l'm just trying to pass the time, man.

525
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,836
Listen, l know you're a robot,
but don't you have feelings?

526
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,798
l mean, isn't it hard to destroy innocent
people that have never wronged you?

527
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:31,508
Everyone's wronged l.S.R.A.E.L.

528
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:32,968
Really? Wow.

529
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:35,929
lf that's the way you feel, maybe
we'd all be better off if you didn't exist.

530
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,807
l.S.R.A.E.L. has every right to exist!

531
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:42,853
Ok, ok, dude, relax.
Don't get so defensive.

532
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,980
I.S.R.A.E.L. need rest.

533
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:54,031
Here? This is where you want to rest?

534
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,867
This is the single most dangerous place
you could be situated!

535
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:59,578
There are so many other
places you could be, l.S.R.A.E.L.,

536
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:02,164
that would be safer and
would cause less problems!

537
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,457
Why here?

538
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:06,001
I.S.R.A.E.L. shouIdn't have to Ieave.
Everyone else should leave.

539
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:07,502
They're the ones who are stupid.

540
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:10,547
Oy! l.S.R.A.E.L., you are a handful.

541
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:18,055
l'm sorry, Drawn Togethergang.
But l have to save my Jew son.

542
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:21,266
Oh, l.S.R.A.E.L., l think
l know where they are.

543
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,275
Oh, yeah.

544
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:34,196
l haven't seen this many shit-covered
rodents since my last colonoscopy.

545
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,405
-Ta!

546
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:42,537
Oh, it's ok, Clara.
So we're not who we think we are.

547
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:45,791
-So what, right?
-So what?

548
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,501
lf l'm not a princess,

549
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:51,046
then l'm just another beautiful virgin
with real C-cups and a super tight ass

550
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:54,132
that continuously vibrates
and tastes like wild berries.

551
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,635
Who could ever love someone like that?

552
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:03,266
Dungeon master, make sure the guillotine
is not too far back on the stage.

553
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:07,813
l want the people in the
front row to have to wear rain ponchos.

554
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:12,484
Milord, perhaps you could see it in your heart
to let me live here in your kingdom

555
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:16,863
and give me the opportunity to be
the real princess l always thought l was.

556
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:21,368
For l can be just as good as the officially
sanctioned princesses in your kingdom.

557
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,911
Allow me.

558
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:37,801
Yeah, Clara! She's doing it! lt's working!

559
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:40,971
For fuck's sake, Xandir!
l'm trying to impress the goddamn king!

560
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:45,016
And l can't fucking sing if you keep
flapping those dick-sucking lips of yours!

561
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:54,317
Guards, tomorrow, off with their heads!

562
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,653
No, wait! Please!

563
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,613
Release the king, vile peasant!

564
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,949
Hero! Do something!

565
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:03,201
Oh, yes, of course.
You shouldn't see this, baby.

566
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,871
l know how you are around blood,
and this could easily go that way.

567
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:14,087
Oh, you totally would
not have been into that.

568
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:22,637
Excuse me, Suck My Taint Girl, we...

569
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:25,891
Oh, my goodness!
You guys are from Drawn Together!

570
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:28,310
Uh, l heard you were all erased.

571
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:31,980
-You know who we are?
-Well, of course l do, silly.

572
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:34,983
l'm, like, the taintest fan
of Drawn Together ever.

573
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,985
l tain't missed an episode.

574
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:39,529
Well, good, 'cause we need your help,
Suck My Taint Girl.

575
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,865
We was canceled,
and we need to get back on TV.

576
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,825
But of course you were canceled.

577
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:47,204
You guys were filthy and offensive
without ever having a point.

578
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:50,290
A p-p-p-pa... Pa... Po...

579
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:55,295
Po... Po... Poi...

580
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,924
Poi... Aah... Poi... Ohh...

581
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,134
Ohh... Ahh... Oint?

582
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,429
Yeah! You know, like social commentary.

583
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:08,058
Everybody knows that these days,
if you want to be raunchy and funny on TV,

584
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:10,894
you need to also be relentlessly preachy.

585
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:14,564
-Too bad we never had a point.
-Hey. Know what you should do?

586
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,107
You should go to Make-A-Point Land

587
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,485
and get yourself a point
from the MakeA-Point wizard.

588
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,904
You'll be back on the air in no time!

589
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:25,575
Really? Because if you're lying, l'll cut you.
l'll cut you to the fucking bone.

590
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:30,497
Ooh! Can you take us to this
Make-A-Point Land, Suck My Taint Girl?

591
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:36,378
Well, l really shouldn't be seen with
you guys, but l could be convinced

592
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:38,964
if you introduced me
to the rest of the Drawn Togethergang.

593
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:42,425
Huh? What do you say? ls it a deal?

594
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,475
No, Molly, you're the cutest.

595
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:52,227
No, you are!

596
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:56,273
Watching Hero and his whorish
know-it-all girlfriend made me sick.

597
00:37:56,357 --> 00:38:00,902
l had to get Hero to break up with Molly
so l could have my best friend back.

598
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,779
And l had just the plan.

599
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,615
Got it?

600
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,285
Now, follow my lead, and don't fuck it up.

601
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,536
Uh, Xandir?

602
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,795
Wait, wait. Best friend in Ling...

603
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,964
Oh, God!

604
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:24,426
Asians are hilarious!

605
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,011
Come on, Ling-Ling.

606
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:30,348
Ling-Ling into depression go

607
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:34,519
He blew his chance with Xandir

608
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:38,648
Xandir only have eyes for Hero

609
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:42,193
Ling-Ling die alone

610
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,615
What was that, Molly?
You have the perfect escape plan?

611
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,743
We'll be out of here in no time?

612
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:52,662
Really, Molly? Oh, that's awesome!

613
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,831
When Molly just
lies there and does nothing,

614
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,875
we'll all be executed in the morning,

615
00:38:56,959 --> 00:39:00,837
and Hero will finally realize
how lame his dead girlfriend is.

616
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:02,422
l'm so clever!

617
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,341
Oh, l can't stand it!

618
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:07,052
Well, the guards are coming, Molly.

619
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:11,598
We can't wait to see
your plan in action, can we, guys?

620
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:17,437
Molly... Come on, do something.

621
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:20,774
You're embarrassing me
in front of all my guy friends.

622
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,196
Oh, maybe they were right about you.

623
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,322
Maybe we should just break...

624
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:32,327
-Whoa! That prisoner doesn't look so hot!
-She's pale, and that rat is eating her eyeball.

625
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:34,871
We better do something!

626
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:39,626
Ooh! Clever, clever.

627
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:47,258
Psst! That guard outfit makes you look fat.

628
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:50,178
lt does?

629
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:52,972
Oh, great! Now l'll have
to deal with that all night.

630
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,224
Ryan, wait up!

631
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:58,061
Molly, your plan worked like a charm!
Oh, l'm so happy!

632
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:01,898
Later on, l'm gonna let you
fuck me in the mouth!

633
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:04,943
-God damn it!
-Now, let's get out of here.

634
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,988
Hey, the prisoners have escaped!

635
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:12,492
Come on, Clara!

636
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:17,330
No. l have nothing to live for anymore.
l'm not a princess. Now, go.

637
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:20,041
l'll slow them down for you.
lt's the only way.

638
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:23,711
Thanks, Clara. You'll always
be a princess to me. Here.

639
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:26,548
No, you keep them.
They're of no use to me now.

640
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,007
l'll treasure them always.

641
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,969
Wait, Xandir, do me one favor.

642
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:33,221
Live your gay life to the fullest.

643
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:35,223
-Will do.
-Every day's a gift.

644
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:38,435
-Gotcha.
-And find that one special person.

645
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,061
Sure thing. Bye!

646
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:43,731
And hold him close
and tell him with all your heart

647
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:47,402
that you can't marry him.
The Bible forbids it.

648
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:48,695
l really gotta go.

649
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:51,364
Ok. Bye! Don't adopt!

650
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,084
Give me those!

651
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,930
Molly hath saved the day!

652
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,608
Holy fuck, it's l.S.R.A.E.L. !

653
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,444
Uh, hey, guys, how are you?

654
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:31,571
Uh, l'd get the hell
out of here if l were you.

655
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,072
-Huzzah!

656
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:44,167
So tired. So very, very tired.

657
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,503
Don't you give up, fool horse.

658
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,421
We got to make it to the kingdom

659
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:52,800
to get the rest of our gang
so we can all get to Make-A-Point Land.

660
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:57,889
And then, we still need to find Toot.
This is a joke. We'll never find everyone.

661
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:04,771
l said, we'll never find everyone.

662
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,028
Look! There them are-uh!

663
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:14,614
And l.S.R.A.E.L. !

664
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:21,955
Whee...

665
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,249
Are all together again!

666
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,750
Wait. Where's Clara?

667
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:28,086
Oh, Clara? She's dead.

668
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:30,380
Oh, no.

669
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:34,592
-Yeah!
-Oh, good!

670
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:37,345
-Well, that takes the sting off.
-Her arms were always my favorite part of her.

671
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:44,394
Ashes to ashes, smurf to smurf.

672
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:46,896
l'm glad you're dead, you bastard!

673
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:50,900
l hope you smurf in hell for what
you did to me in front of my kids!

674
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:53,570
l hope you smurf in hell!

675
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:59,701
lt's ok, sweetie.
Our long national nightmare is over.

676
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:03,788
He can't hurt us anymore.
The important thing is that you survived.

677
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:06,332
-We all survived.

678
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:25,685
Say good-bye, Drawn Together!

679
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,353
No!

680
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,521
-I can't see!

681
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,440
-I can't see!

682
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:39,198
Ugh! Holy crap! l can't open the door.

683
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,701
lt's stuck! We gonna drown!

684
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:47,248
Don't worry, people. l'll get us out.

685
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:51,711
Yeah, there you are.

686
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,423
Uhh... That wasn't well thought-out.

687
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:09,646
No!

688
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,564
l loved you!

689
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:15,443
The Drawn Together gang is gone forever.

690
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:17,528
Ok. We're on our way.

691
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:26,913
Molly, this may be it for us.

692
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:30,708
Commentary.

693
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:32,710
-Commentary?
-Commonary.

694
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:35,505
They usually have director's
commissary on these things.

695
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:37,006
Let's listen to the commonary.

696
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:39,175
Maybe they'll tell us
how to get out of here.

697
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:41,511
lt's too late. We're all gonna die!

698
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:43,179
We have to try!

699
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:47,892
Menu.

700
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:49,519
Commentary.

701
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:50,978
Commentary on.

702
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,772
And play!

703
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:56,109
So, wow.
This movie just keeps on going.

704
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:57,235
-lt's, uh...
-l hear them!

705
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:58,695
-lt's a long thing... This movie...
-Help!

706
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:01,781
-How do we get out of here?
-Shut the fuck up and listen!

707
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:04,242
Actually might very well be a bad idea,

708
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:07,537
but, um, Dave...
Dave, he needed the money.

709
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:10,039
Well, Matt...
Matt married into money.

710
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:11,999
Who the hell would
ever want to listen to this?

711
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:14,544
lt used to be money.
Now, nobody has money...

712
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:17,380
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Get to the point!

713
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:19,132
All right. So now we got,
uh, we got the gang,

714
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:21,342
we put them all in this pumpkin.
We put them underwater,

715
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:23,886
and originally, this scene
wasn't even in the script at all.

716
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:25,722
The only reason we did this is 'cause,

717
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,598
well, we both thought
that I.S.R.A.E.L...

718
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:30,476
We had to remind the audience that
l.S.R.A.E.L. is still chasing after them.

719
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:31,936
Well, you thought they had to.

720
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,105
l remember thinking
we didn't really need this whole scene.

721
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:36,232
We were going with a new
production company, and...

722
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:39,569
But l didn't want to fight with you.
l remember being so exhausted, at this point.

723
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:41,404
My wife was, like, 9 months pregnant,

724
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:42,947
and we were, like,
in the middle of moving, right?

725
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:44,907
You're, like, the first person
that ever had a kid.

726
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,117
That's how you act.

727
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:48,536
l actually remember...

728
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:52,081
l'm the first person that ever had a kid
and had to argue with you at the same time.

729
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,292
You have got to be shitting me.

730
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:56,043
How the hell are we going
to get them out of this scene?

731
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:58,212
We don't have any ideas, and l think...

732
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,589
l'm pretty sure you're the one who's like,

733
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:01,507
"Hey, why don't they
just suck on Xandir's dick,

734
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:03,217
"and Xandir's dick's got oxygen,"

735
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:06,471
'cause you're always like... The first idea is,
"Hey, they can suck each other's dicks!"

736
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:08,514
Oh, yeah. That's a good idea.

737
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,517
l think your idea was,
"What if Xandir poos oxygen?"

738
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:14,270
Oh, no. "What if he farts oxygen,
so they have to suck his ass?"

739
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:15,563
So yours was that much better.

740
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:17,315
-That's smarter.
-Oh, for the love of God.

741
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:18,775
This is horrible!

742
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,401
I don't even remember
how we got out of this.

743
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:21,694
Oh, you know what it was?

744
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:23,154
This is how we come out
with a Iot of these scenes.

745
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:25,031
lt's, like, who haven't we used in a while?

746
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:28,451
Like, Ling-Ling? What if we pull his tail,
and he infIates Iike a raft?

747
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:31,454
-That's fine, that's fine.
-So theyjust do that.

748
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:33,122
At a certain point,
it's just like "whatever."

749
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:38,002
Ooh, l gots an idea, gang.
Let's use Ling-Ling as an inflatable raft.

750
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:40,463
So, anyway, l guess if this
scene's going to be worth it at all,

751
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:42,215
maybe we should at least see Foxxy's tits.

752
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,800
-I'm in.
-But first,

753
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:45,384
let me take off my shirt.

754
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:03,778
We made it! Whee!

755
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:05,321
Nice tits, Foxxy.

756
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:09,242
Good work, gang.
Now let's go find Toot.

757
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:11,869
Now, the only one
we needed was Toot,

758
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:17,959
so we set off on ourjourney to find her,
a journey of excitement and adventure,

759
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:21,546
mystery and mayhem, love and loss,

760
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:25,174
a journey that carried us
to far-away lands

761
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:31,848
and taught us so much about
what was right here inside us all along.

762
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:36,394
A journey which would change us all forever.

763
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:37,687
And then, we found her fat ass.

764
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:42,358
Foxxy, what the hell are you doing here?

765
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:45,236
We can't be seen together.
You'll get us killed.

766
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,863
Toot, you got to come with me.

767
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,906
You not safe here anymore, fatty.

768
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:52,034
You don't know that.
You don't know anything.

769
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,494
l know this.

770
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,585
Put on your 3-D glasses now!

771
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:01,878
3-D glasses not included.

772
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:14,390
FOXXY: Yeah, girl.
That's what the Foxxy want.

773
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:16,559
One finger?

774
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:19,645
Girl, you got to come back when
you can at least kick in a big toe.

775
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:23,232
What are you guys doing? Making out?

776
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:26,694
Hey, lady, less talky,
more threesome action.

777
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:42,835
Yes! God damn it, l miss Drawn Together.

778
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,420
Hold on. Oh, my God!

779
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:46,923
Where do you want it?
Where do you want it?

780
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:48,299
Anywhere but the face.

781
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:52,762
l mean, that is really degrading to women.
l mean, you could really...

782
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:56,515
-l deserved that.
-You deserve to die.

783
00:48:58,435 --> 00:48:59,727
Get out ofthere now!

784
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:02,104
Let's go! Go! Go! Go!

785
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:11,030
Stop! l can't fly without my feather!

786
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,793
Got it! Let's go!

787
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:37,181
Burn in hell, you fat
fucking homewrecking bitch!

788
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:38,808
lt's a living.

789
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,814
Outrageous!

790
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:47,817
How did you think you were
going to get away with this?

791
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:50,778
A foul-mouthed clone of my daughter.

792
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:54,448
What if some child actually thought
it was her using the word shitcunt?

793
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:57,827
l understand. But we are taking measures.

794
00:49:57,911 --> 00:50:00,413
We are taking measures, too. Ooh!

795
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:02,206
-What the...

796
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:07,712
Target has been eliminated.

797
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:11,007
Just to be on the safe side,
erase the whole place.

798
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:14,844
And get back here when you're done.
There's been a change of plans.

799
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:18,514
But sir, this is the happiest place on earth.

800
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:21,475
lt was the happiest place on earth.

801
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:26,480
Erase it aII.

802
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:29,108
lt's a world of laughter

803
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:32,403
It's a worId of sunshine

804
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:46,042
After we got Toot back from Bedrock,

805
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:48,711
we immediately brought
her to Suck My Taint Girl.

806
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:52,631
You're all here! Hooray!

807
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,800
Wait. Where's Clara?

808
00:50:56,303 --> 00:51:00,264
And we told Suck My Taint Girl
the terribIe news about Clara.

809
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:02,558
-What?
-She took it pretty hard.

810
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:07,897
But after a long talk and
a respectaful memoryial service,

811
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:11,317
Suck My Taint Girl agreed to
take us to Make-A-Point Land,

812
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:15,404
help us find the Make-A-Point wizard, get
our point, and get our show back on the air,

813
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:19,825
hence redeeming myself for
getting us all into this mess in the first place.

814
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:24,038
Uh, why did you say all that?

815
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:27,166
Sorry, giving confessionals
is a hard habit to break.

816
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,502
Well, it seems kind of crazy.

817
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:34,757
You know what's crazy?
You ass-bags dragging me here.

818
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:38,469
When my Barney comes for me,
you'll all get yours.

819
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:43,432
This is great and all, but can we
get going to Make-A-Point Land

820
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:44,767
before l.S.R.A.E.L. finds us?

821
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:46,477
Tain't no time like the present.

822
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:47,853
But remember,

823
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:52,316
there are lots of magical and mysterious
creatures in Make-A-Point Land,

824
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,776
and they don't take too kindly

825
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:57,530
to those who are disgusting
for the sake of being disgusting.

826
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:04,745
What? l'm sorry. l got distracted.
What were you saying?

827
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:10,584
l was saying it's time we go.
Let's taint the town brown!

828
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:25,933
Uh, question. Why is your ship
plugged into the ass of that animal?

829
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:32,398
Oh, Mr. Ham. l'm so glad you asked,
because you're going to love this.

830
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:37,153
This ship is powered by... Wait for it...

831
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:38,279
Poo!

832
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:44,535
A feces-fueled rocket ship? That's awesome!

833
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:48,080
Yep. This ship is an ear of corn
powered by bull shit

834
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:52,585
because, don't you see, ethanol is bullshit.

835
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:54,879
Oh, yeah. l get it.

836
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:58,507
l kind of liked it better when
it was just a shit-powered rocket.

837
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:02,011
T-minus 5, 4,

838
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:04,847
3, 2, 1 .

839
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:06,432
Liftoff.

840
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:14,481
Well, l gotta hit the head.

841
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:16,859
Don't go changing while l'm away.

842
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:22,823
l am sick of it
just being the 2 of us.

843
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:26,869
Playing hot potato just sucks
without my beloved Hero.

844
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:28,829
And l love hot potato!

845
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:32,875
Ling-Ling make sad realization

846
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:36,962
Xandir's heart is with another

847
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:41,884
if Ling-Ling really loves Xandir
like he says he does

848
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:45,721
He'll help Xandir get back Hero

849
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:52,895
What? Molly!

850
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:55,356
You promised me we'd go to prom together!

851
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,108
l can't believe you would do this to me!

852
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,238
Later

853
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:06,742
Guys, it's over between me and Molly.

854
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:13,540
Oh, there you go. lt's ok.
Cry on my shoulder, darling.

855
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:17,086
-Hyah!
-Look, Make-A-Point Land!

856
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:18,420
Where? l can't see it.

857
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:19,838
lt's right over there between

858
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,924
Why-You-So-Bitter-
About-Being-Canceled Land

859
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:24,551
and You-Had-3-Or-4-Seasons,
You-Should-Be-Happy-With-What-You-Got,

860
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:26,136
Most-Shows-Don't-Even-Get-That Land.

861
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:34,395
Hold onto my taint, everyone!
lt's going to be a rough landing.

862
00:54:43,571 --> 00:54:47,283
Here we are, Make-A-Point Land!

863
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:51,412
Put on your 3-D glasses now!

864
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:53,163
3-D glasses not included.

865
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:04,758
3-D! The technology
of the eighties, but it's now!

866
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:08,721
Whoa! Whoa!

867
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:25,529
lt looks fake.

868
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:28,907
Let's move quickly, and don't
taint any attention to yourselves.

869
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:37,082
-That's a fetus tornado.
-Huh? A fetus tornado?

870
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:42,171
Don't you see? People just go round and
round when it comes to stem cell research.

871
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:44,006
Well. Not as funny.

872
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:48,010
Ray-Ray 2 through 7! Mama love you!

873
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,475
-Cool!

874
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:59,021
The Pfizersaurus Rex! Don't you see?

875
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:01,857
lf we keep listening to
the pharmaceutical companies,

876
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:04,818
one day, we, too, will be extinct.

877
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:06,445
Not so cool anymore.

878
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:08,197
Come on, gang. Let's keep moving

879
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:11,033
before we get spotted by
floating Tom Brokaw made of semen.

880
00:56:11,117 --> 00:56:15,037
Floating Tom Brokaw made of semen?
What the fuck is his point?

881
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:20,626
Maybe that the media is dumb
and superficial and delicious?

882
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:23,921
Look! The wizard's palace!

883
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:33,055
Oh, no! lt's the Giant
Who Shits lnto His Own Mouth!

884
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:41,730
Fee, fi, fo, fums!
l smell pointless abominations!

885
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:44,566
l must kill you!

886
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,405
Wait, Giant Who Shits lnto His Own Mouth!

887
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:51,573
Now, l know my Drawn Togetherfriends

888
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:54,743
are stupid, pointless, crude creatures
of mediocre comedy.

889
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:59,415
That's why l brought them here.
To get a point. You can't kill them!

890
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:02,626
l can do anything l want!

891
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:05,963
Except get the taste of shit out of my mouth.

892
00:57:07,715 --> 00:57:10,801
Hold up, Giant Who
Shits lnto His Own Mouth.

893
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:13,595
You saying you don't like eating shit?

894
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:18,392
l eat shit all day, every day, 24/7.
Of course l don't like it.

895
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:21,854
But it's how l was born.

896
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:27,818
Well, what if we help you?
Then would you let us go?

897
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:29,820
Mmm-hmm.

898
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:34,283
lf only we had something
we could tie to the giant's head

899
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:37,202
to interrupt the flow of poop.

900
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:46,044
lt's working! lt's working!

901
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:52,718
Amen.

902
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:55,804
Hallelujah. Your way talking.

903
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:59,641
l... l can't taste shit,
for the first time in my whole life!

904
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:01,810
Thank you! Oh, thank you!

905
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:05,397
l'm finally free! l can eat whatever l want now!

906
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:06,565
Anything!

907
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:09,568
That's right, Giant. Anything!

908
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:14,740
Would you shit in my mouth?

909
00:58:16,784 --> 00:58:19,661
Well, guys, here we are.

910
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:23,749
lmpressive.

911
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:27,377
Thanks, Suck My Taint Girl.
The Make-A-Point wizard's got to help.

912
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:28,921
He's just gotta.

913
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:33,050
Uh, any chance there's a
Wrap-This-Thing-Up-Already wizard in there?

914
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:37,513
l can't believe the MakeA-Point wizard
finally gave me my point.

915
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:40,390
Of course! l represent the
duality of goodness and martyrdom

916
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:43,602
and the unencumbered id that is repressed
when religion meets sexuality.

917
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:45,187
And crab.

918
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:47,397
-Come on.

919
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:49,942
Let's get ourselves back on the air.

920
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:57,407
Who has come forth seeking a point, hmm?

921
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:03,956
Your Majesty, l humbly present to you
what's left of the Drawn Togethergang.

922
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:09,920
Oh, my. You kids have
caused quite a bit of trouble.

923
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:13,674
Honestly, l don't
even think a point can help.

924
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:17,553
You Honor, dis is our only shot.

925
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:22,266
lf we don't get the Drawn Together
back on TV, we ain't never gonna be safe.

926
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:25,185
Please, Mr. Wizard. Without my TV persona,

927
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:27,688
l'm just another 33-year-old
schizophrenic drug addict

928
00:59:27,772 --> 00:59:29,731
with jaundice and several deformities.

929
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:34,069
Fine, fine. Sheesh! l'll give you a point.

930
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:03,348
lmpressive.

931
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:05,767
Well, this is it, y'all.

932
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:08,604
We's about to get our point,
get back on the air,

933
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:11,356
and things can finally
get back to the way they was.

934
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:17,529
Don't you see?

935
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:22,451
Don't you see? Don't you see?

936
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:25,621
Wait! Maybe we shouldn't open it.

937
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:28,123
What the fuck are you talking about, Spanky?

938
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:29,583
Yeah! Just open it!

939
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:33,003
This doesn't seem right.
l mean, maybe we don't want a point.

940
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:36,632
Don't you see? lf l can't fart or vomit

941
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:41,053
or fill up an ice tray with the
afterbirth of Foxxy's miscarriage

942
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:45,766
and hand them out as ice pops to
terminally ill children on my hospital tours

943
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:51,104
without making some kind of point,
then maybe it's just not worth it.

944
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:03,367
And l don't want to let dead chicks
fuck me in my mouth for social commentary.

945
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:07,037
l mean, what's wrong with just
doing it 'cause it makes me feel good?

946
01:01:07,121 --> 01:01:09,623
And l sure do like
getting pregnant for no reason.

947
01:01:09,707 --> 01:01:11,875
You know what? l agree with the pig.

948
01:01:11,959 --> 01:01:13,335
Thank you.

949
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:15,504
So, Mr. Make-A-Point wizard,

950
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:18,298
l guess we don't want
to make-a-point after all.

951
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:19,925
Maybe that's the point.

952
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:24,096
Fuck you guys!

953
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:27,474
l need Drawn Together!
Otherwise, l don't exist!

954
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:30,686
-No, wait! lt's...
-What the...

955
01:01:36,609 --> 01:01:38,527
-Wooldoor!
-What the fuck, wizard?

956
01:01:38,611 --> 01:01:43,865
l'm sorry. l had no choice.
They said they'd kill me.

957
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:45,492
Who would kill you?

958
01:01:45,576 --> 01:01:48,912
Hello there, Drawn Togethergang.

959
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:53,959
lt's a pleasure to finally meet you face to face.

960
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:57,212
So you the dick that's been trying to kill us.

961
01:01:57,296 --> 01:01:59,715
How the hell did you even
know we was coming here?

962
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:02,008
-l told them.

963
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:03,468
Suck My Taint Girl?

964
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:09,599
Roved you?
Drawn Together is the lamest show ever!

965
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:12,394
Watching it was like watching taint dry.

966
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:16,064
And if l let you get a point,
you might get your timeslot back.

967
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:18,108
Why the fuck would l do that?

968
01:02:21,028 --> 01:02:22,237
Damn that girl.

969
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:25,907
Like my lawn after a visit from that klansman
with short-term memory loss,

970
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:27,367
we've been double crossed.

971
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:29,578
-Nice work, honey.
-Thanks, Scott.

972
01:02:29,662 --> 01:02:31,997
-Mmm.
-That's right. Suck my taint.

973
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:34,958
Damn you, Suck My Taint Girl.
You betrayed us.

974
01:02:35,042 --> 01:02:37,127
And then, you didn't
even give us a fair fight.

975
01:02:37,211 --> 01:02:40,672
Sometimes, l don't know if
you're an asshole or a pussy,

976
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:42,382
or something in between.

977
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:48,221
Now, l.S.R.A.E.L.,

978
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:52,517
on behalf of my dead wife and
daughter from a previous marriage,

979
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:54,436
erase them all!

980
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:58,273
Don't worry.

981
01:02:58,357 --> 01:03:01,860
Barney will be here any second to save us.
l just know it.

982
01:03:10,244 --> 01:03:14,748
At least we're going to die together,
Drawn Together.

983
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:23,715
Please, l.S.R.A.E.L., l know
they're obscene, pointless rip-offs,

984
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:27,344
but l... l... Love them.

985
01:03:27,428 --> 01:03:28,970
-Fag.
Ahem. Jew's a homo.

986
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:32,349
Move, Jew Producer,
or l will destroy you as well.

987
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:34,726
You can't do this, l.S.R.A.E.L. Don't you see?

988
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:38,688
Even though everyone hates the Drawn
Togethergang, they have a right to exist.

989
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:41,650
Surely you understand that,
don't you, l.S.R.A.E.L.?

990
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:52,327
l.S.R.A.E.L. doesn't want to destroy.
l.S.R.A.E.L. wants to peacefully coexist.

991
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:56,498
That's all l.S.R.A.E.L. ever wanted.

992
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:01,086
No wonder everyone hates you, l.S.R.A.E.L.

993
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:04,381
You're so goddamn aggravating.

994
01:04:04,465 --> 01:04:08,677
l said destroy them, you fucking idiot!

995
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:12,055
That's it! I.S.R.A.E.L. wiII not Iet
you bully her around anymore.

996
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:17,978
l.S.R.A.E.L. really is our greatest ally.

997
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:21,857
That's a bit much.

998
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:24,693
l.S.R.A.E.L.'s going
a bit overboard again.

999
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:35,453
Why in the hell are you laughing?
You're gonna die.

1000
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:38,039
Because of this.

1001
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:51,636
l have enough e-5 to destroy
all of MakeA-Point Land.

1002
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:56,808
Looks like l'll be enjoying
the Drawn Togethergang in hell!

1003
01:05:01,522 --> 01:05:03,857
You gots a real weird sense of humor.

1004
01:05:03,941 --> 01:05:06,151
Hero, do something!

1005
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:09,821
l miss Molly!

1006
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:14,117
Looks like it's up to ol' fatass again.

1007
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:26,379
That is totally not what l meant to do.

1008
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:29,174
The Drawn Togethergang must die!

1009
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:31,760
Oh, no, you don't!

1010
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:36,473
Everyone, run, run!
Don't worry about the old...

1011
01:05:36,557 --> 01:05:40,352
Um, they left, like, 5 minutes ago.

1012
01:05:40,686 --> 01:05:41,978
-Guys!

1013
01:05:42,063 --> 01:05:44,356
l haven't been laid in 6 months!

1014
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:47,734
l have an erection right now,
and l don't know how long it will last!

1015
01:05:47,818 --> 01:05:49,569
l'm just putting that out there.

1016
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:52,989
Tain't yours! Taint give it to me!

1017
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:54,950
Ok, but first, give it to me!

1018
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:59,454
Don't you see? lf people
all over the world would just...

1019
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:04,668
Next year in Jerusalem!

1020
01:06:11,759 --> 01:06:13,218
Oh, Lordy!

1021
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:16,972
Fuck yeah! l'm going to
escape the fuck out of this shit!

1022
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:19,057
Where the hell are you... Aah!

1023
01:06:20,017 --> 01:06:21,559
Oh, Barney!

1024
01:06:24,522 --> 01:06:27,607
l knew you'd come for me!
l just knew it!

1025
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:30,360
Uh, yeah. Actually, l just came to tell you

1026
01:06:30,444 --> 01:06:33,321
l worked out everything with my wife.
So we have to end our affair.

1027
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:35,073
Sorry. Here.

1028
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:37,993
lt's a living.

1029
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:42,122
Oh, damn it.

1030
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:48,086
Oh, Lordy! Oh, now what we gonna do?

1031
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:51,172
Oh, my God! Get us the fuck out of here!

1032
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:52,507
Help!

1033
01:06:54,468 --> 01:06:57,429
Hey, you guys!

1034
01:07:16,782 --> 01:07:19,242
Take off your 3-D glasses now.

1035
01:07:19,326 --> 01:07:20,910
3-D glasses not included.

1036
01:07:29,795 --> 01:07:31,921
Yeah, but at least we're alive,

1037
01:07:32,006 --> 01:07:36,051
thanks to you, Giant Who
No Longer Shits lnto His Own Mouth.

1038
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:37,719
lt's the least l could do.

1039
01:07:37,803 --> 01:07:40,889
l wish there was some way
l could help you get back on the air.

1040
01:07:40,973 --> 01:07:42,307
l think l can help.

1041
01:07:42,808 --> 01:07:46,561
Jew Son! Oh, l'm so sorry about your father.

1042
01:07:46,645 --> 01:07:49,898
lt's ok. He died saving those he loved.

1043
01:07:49,982 --> 01:07:51,274
Fag.
Ahem. Jew's a homo.

1044
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:54,569
And now that he's gone,
l'm taking over the family business.

1045
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:03,578
Uh, l don't think so,
but l do have a surprise for you.

1046
01:08:03,662 --> 01:08:06,956
Papa?
-Even better!

1047
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:09,959
l pulled some Jew strings

1048
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:12,128
and l think l can get you

1049
01:08:12,213 --> 01:08:15,131
a Direct-to-DVD movie!

1050
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:18,259
For real-real, not for play-play?

1051
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:22,305
Yes, Foxxy, for real-real, not for play-play.

1052
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:27,769
Well, no offense to you guys,

1053
01:08:27,853 --> 01:08:32,774
but l don't want to be in a Direct-to-DVD
movie if it doesn't have a happy ending.

1054
01:08:32,858 --> 01:08:35,193
-Hero, look who l found!

1055
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:36,778
Molly!

1056
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:40,824
Oh, l love it when she does that.

1057
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:45,995
Hey, there, baby. How you doin'?

1058
01:08:47,706 --> 01:08:49,040
You like shitting in people's mouths, right?

1059
01:08:50,751 --> 01:08:55,505
What, Molly? Of course, l'd love
to let you fuck me in my mouth,

1060
01:08:55,589 --> 01:09:00,510
but not tonight,
'cause tonight is guys' night.

1061
01:09:09,436 --> 01:09:10,520
Aw, shitcunt.

1062
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:17,235
Why don't you suck

1063
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:24,450
-Suck my taint
-Suck my taint

1064
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:27,787
-Suck my stinky little taint
-Suck my taint

1065
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:30,582
-Suck my taint
-Suck my taint

1066
01:09:31,208 --> 01:09:32,333
Suck my taint

1067
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:37,797
Come on, and suck my stinky little taint

1068
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:51,686
Take it up the ass, metaphorically

1069
01:09:52,313 --> 01:09:56,733
Suck on a massive dong, allegorically

1070
01:09:57,234 --> 01:10:01,613
Slather spewing dung
across a sweaty symbolic ass

1071
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:06,284
And we can make this fuckall a better world

1072
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:11,497
When you crap yourself, it's an opportunity

1073
01:10:11,832 --> 01:10:16,461
To scoop up the excrement and eat it

1074
01:10:17,129 --> 01:10:21,466
Thereby showing how
you can jizz on a rotting cow

1075
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:26,054
And make this fuckall a better world

1076
01:10:26,138 --> 01:10:28,765
Just make a point with your vomit

1077
01:10:28,849 --> 01:10:31,184
Make a point with unbridled mayhem

1078
01:10:31,268 --> 01:10:35,605
When you make a point to
teach the boys and girls

1079
01:10:35,689 --> 01:10:38,733
That you can make a point
by eating the puke chunks

1080
01:10:38,817 --> 01:10:41,194
And make a point by cannibalizing ears

1081
01:10:41,278 --> 01:10:46,157
Make a point and make
this fuckall a better world

1082
01:10:46,825 --> 01:10:48,618
Gargle a glop of snot

1083
01:10:48,702 --> 01:10:51,704
Then swallow it, metaphorically

1084
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:56,125
Fondle a donkey's cock
while felching it, allegorically

1085
01:10:56,210 --> 01:11:01,089
Beat off into
a Christmas stocking, mockingly

1086
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:05,802
And make this fuckall a better world

1087
01:11:05,886 --> 01:11:11,808
Make a point and make
this fuckall a better world

1088
01:11:12,305 --> 01:12:12,483
