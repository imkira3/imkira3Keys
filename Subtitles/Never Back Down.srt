1
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:07,725
<i>Inside of a minute left to
play. The Knights need a big stop here.</i>

2
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:09,699
Motion! Motion!

3
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:15,298
<i>There's the snap and off goes Devore.
Tries to go off-tackle. Big hit by Jake Tyler.</i>

4
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,399
Forty-four is killing us.
Get in there and stop him.

5
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,477
You want some of this, bitch?

6
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:19,977
Good one, Jake!

7
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,069
It's all good.

8
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:22,170
Call it out!

9
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:26,878
<i>That is Tyler's 13th
tackle tonight. He is totally in the zone.</i>

10
00:01:26,987 --> 00:01:30,548
Coming through! Coming through! I got it!

11
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,090
<i>Third down and 10.
Look for the quarterback on...</i>

12
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:35,184
- Blue, 32.
- Hut!

13
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:36,421
<i>There's the snap.</i>

14
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,989
<i>Pitch is wide to Moore.</i>

15
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,960
<i>And Jake Tyler makes
a big stop at the backfield.</i>

16
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,901
<i>Loss of three yards on the play.</i>

17
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:48,668
Keep it up, baby!
It ain't gonna change the score.

18
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,709
<i>Now Tyler and Moore are at
each other's faces.</i>

19
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,370
<i>They have been going at it all night long.</i>

20
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,776
<i>Lowe deep in the pocket.</i>

21
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:58,350
Outside! Outside!

22
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:02,251
<i>Now slings it out wide to Moore.
Ball's a little high.</i>

23
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:08,382
<i>Tyler hit Moore on the dead run,
and right down!</i>

24
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:11,155
<i>This could be it for the Hornets, folks.</i>

25
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:13,755
You know, it's too bad about your old man.

26
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:20,470
The sauce. That shit will kill you.

27
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:25,177
What'd you say? What'd you say?

28
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,315
<i>Tyler and Moore are going at it.</i>

29
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:52,667
Hey, don't sweat it, Jake.
Good luck down there.

30
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:56,330
- Later, man.
- Dude.

31
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:59,643
Way to go out with a bang.

32
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:02,380
- Yeah.
- How's the hand?

33
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:03,506
I'll be all right.

34
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:06,312
Hey, come on, everyone's going over
to Harland's.

35
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:11,747
No, man. I can't.
I still got some packing to do.

36
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,493
I can't believe you're moving
to Disney World.

37
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:16,084
Orlando.

38
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,188
Yeah, well, I'd come visit you,
but I'm not eight years old.

39
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:22,392
Could have fooled me.

40
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:28,072
Maybe I'll meet you out in Daytona
for spring break.

41
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:30,608
Yeah. Sure.

42
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:38,310
- Who's gonna keep you out of trouble?
- Who's gonna get you into it?

43
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:42,381
Later, bud.

44
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:07,375
- What up?
- Evening feed.

45
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:11,911
It's a contact sport, Mom.

46
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,651
Your coach called.
He told me that you'd been fighting again.

47
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:16,779
You wanna know what the other guy said?

48
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,949
I'm not doing this when we go to Florida,
all right?

49
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:21,822
Then don't do it,
'cause I'm not gonna play, okay?

50
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:24,858
I'm late. I need you to help Charlie pack.

51
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:27,159
You guys start on the garage
first thing in the morning, all right?

52
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:28,391
Damn it, where are my keys?

53
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:30,162
Everything has to be ready for the movers
the day after...

54
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,137
- Mom, I can do my own packing.
- You see? He can do his own packing.

55
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:36,936
- Damn, where are my keys?
- I think I saw them over here!

56
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:42,610
Thank you. Bye. Just do it, Jake.

57
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:56,325
Seventy-two. By flying in a V-formation

58
00:04:57,163 --> 00:05:03,068
a flock of geese adds 72% more
flying range than if each bird flew alone.

59
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:05,631
Something about uplift.

60
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,667
1,392.

61
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:12,511
The number of useless facts in your head.

62
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,739
Miles from here to Orlando.

63
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:19,845
Do you hate me?

64
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:25,383
- Because of the move?
- No.

65
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,627
Famous Stampard Tennis Academy
in Orlando?

66
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:30,829
You better make it to Wimbledon.

67
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,296
Make it? I'll win it.

68
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,159
Here, let me give you a hand with that.

69
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:36,394
- No, I got it.
- No, here.

70
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,050
Guess Mom forgot to bring
that one to Goodwill.

71
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,593
I'll get rid of it.

72
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:52,004
You know, we could just close it,
get behind the wheel.

73
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:54,204
Nothing but open road
between here and Iowa.

74
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:56,782
- What about Mom?
- She wouldn't miss us.

75
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,943
- She'd miss me.
- Yeah, that's real funny.

76
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,929
- I got him!
- Here, get him!

77
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:57,576
You got him.

78
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:02,141
- Get him.
- Hey! Hey! Stop, man!

79
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:09,178
- Hey, I got this. I got this, man. I got this.
- Shit!

80
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:18,093
- Seriously, dude, I think he's got this.
- Damn right!

81
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:24,262
- Get lost, man!
- Yeah, vacate. You don't want none.

82
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,100
- You all right, bro? Are you ready?
- Yeah!

83
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:28,801
- Fight!
- Fight!

84
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,500
Get your hands up.

85
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:43,520
You still with us,
Mr. Tyler? Yeah? Good.

86
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:48,253
<i>The argument can certainly be made
that The Iliad celebrates war, obviously,</i>

87
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:53,655
but not all the symbols in this poem
support that interpretation.

88
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:00,805
What symbol or symbols might suggest a
less vainglorious attitude toward warfare?

89
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,869
Anybody?

90
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:09,209
Anybody? Anybody? Ms. Miller?

91
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:18,856
I'm sorry. You lost me at "vainglorious".

92
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:24,290
Come on. You have read the poem, I take it.
Seen the movie, perhaps?

93
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,427
That's the Shield of Achilles.

94
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:38,135
The scenes of normal life depicted

95
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,509
on Achilles' shield suggest
an alternative to war.

96
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:45,908
Friends or family or what is at stake.

97
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:50,611
Wow! Not bad for your first day, Mr. Tyler.

98
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:55,717
We might all strive to emulate
this kind of preparation and intelligence.

99
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:08,304
Hey, Shield of Achilles, nicely done.
Thanks for the save.

100
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:12,409
- I owe you one.
- No problem.

101
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:15,911
- I'm Baja.
- Like Mexico?

102
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,012
Like my parents smoked too much weed.

103
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:22,821
- I'm Jake.
- So, why the mid-year move?

104
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:26,948
My brother's a tennis star.
He got a scholarship.

105
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:32,958
Not bad. What about you?
You got any talents?

106
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:36,557
I mean, other than sucking up
in English class.

107
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:40,563
Probably not the smoothest move
on the first day, right?

108
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:42,607
Probably not.

109
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:47,545
Hey, can you help me find the 3-wing?

110
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:51,111
- It doesn't exist. Let me see?
- No, it's right there.

111
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,910
Oh, it's the B-wing.

112
00:10:58,191 --> 00:11:00,989
<i>Your handwriting's harder to read
than The Iliad.</i>

113
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,259
Looks like you didn't have
any problem reading it.

114
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:04,795
A book that beat up has got to
be flipped through

115
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,228
at least a couple of times.

116
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,564
- Maybe I bought it used.
- Maybe, but I doubt it.

117
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:12,604
- There you are!
- Hey.

118
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,738
Nice shirt, Kurt Cobain.

119
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:19,903
You are aware it's hotter than Satan's
balls out right now, right? And they're hot.

120
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,502
Guys, give it a rest.

121
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:25,948
- Let's go, B, the lumberjack bores me.
- Not me.

122
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,328
J, guess what they clocked
my serve at today?

123
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,025
I don't know, 1,000?

124
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:45,069
- There's food right here, honey.
- I'm sick of eating takeout.

125
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:48,334
- Eighty-five miles per hour.
- That's great, Charlie!

126
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,705
- Isn't that great, Jake?
- Yeah.

127
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:54,774
How's the new school? You like it?

128
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,610
It's great.

129
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,810
Okay, brainiac. Give me the speed
ketchup leaves the bottle.

130
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,614
Not right now, Charlie.

131
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:04,013
How are the teachers?

132
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:07,820
- They're great.
- Classes? Other kids?

133
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:12,088
It's great. Everything's great.

134
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:17,261
Living out of boxes.
We're even eating out of boxes.

135
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,168
I'd just say everything's just great.

136
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:22,070
You wanna run numbers, Charlie?

137
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:25,268
Four. The number of times that
your brother has had to have stitches.

138
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:29,007
And two. The number of times that he has
been kicked out of school.

139
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:33,051
Six. The number of times I've had to
pick him up from the police station.

140
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:36,349
Tired of living out of boxes, Jake?
Why don't you try unpacking?

141
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:02,010
Dude! What's up?
You're carb loading. That's pretty smart.

142
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:04,749
Yo, I'm Max Cooperman.

143
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:08,486
Crack it.

144
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:12,616
- Jake Tyler.
- I know.

145
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:15,789
I also know that there's
a 225-pound football player in Iowa

146
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:17,795
that's happy as hell you moved.

147
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:20,525
- How'd you know about that?
- Internet, dude.

148
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,498
One guy shoots it, the whole world sees it.

149
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:26,762
Come on.
Tell me you haven't Googled yourself.

150
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,103
Look, when you hit my boy out
with that right hook, man,

151
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:31,165
we did some homework.

152
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:34,769
And your clip, it's starting to
make the rounds, bro.

153
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:38,744
Look, people... People are talking.

154
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,352
See, we got it going on here, man.
This is something you must check out.

155
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:45,583
All right, the other day,
when you saw me fighting,

156
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:48,182
that was completely organized.

157
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:52,321
- A totally sanctioned brawl.
- That looked like an ass-kicking to me, bro.

158
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:54,893
I'm getting my chi together.

159
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,762
I'm learning the moves
from one of the masters.

160
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,930
Jean Roqua. Dude trained with the Gracies
back in the day.

161
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,136
Dude was a finalist in the Vale Tudo, right?

162
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,872
Look, check this out.

163
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:13,949
<i>Wait for the right moment.
Position before submission.</i>

164
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:26,054
Look, I appreciate it and all.
I'm not interested.

165
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:31,435
What? Hey, but, dude. I mean, you're...
You could enter the pantheon of greats.

166
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,596
We're talking significant social profile here.

167
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,833
I mean, you are a natural born brawler.

168
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,607
I'm just not into it, man.

169
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:17,612
- Want a ride?
- No, I'm cool.

170
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:23,018
You sure? We can crank up the AC.
You can wear that flannel.

171
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:28,752
So, what? Is your car in the shop?

172
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:33,591
Yeah, yeah. If by shop you mean
showroom, then, yes. It's a new 335.

173
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:35,290
Feel free to go pick it up for me
any time you want.

174
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,301
It's the silver one I cannot afford.

175
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:39,963
Oh, my God. You are poor!

176
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:44,910
So, there's this party tonight
if you wanna go.

177
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:48,204
- You gonna be there?
- No, no, she's not.

178
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,248
She's inviting you to a party
she's not gonna go to.

179
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:52,075
Does that make sense?

180
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:57,053
Sorry. Here's the address if you wanna go.

181
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,092
See you there?

182
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:06,494
Yeah. Thanks.

183
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,672
The kid was nine. He beat me, 6-3.

184
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:25,443
So he's younger than you.
You're just getting settled in.

185
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,178
You just have to give it time.

186
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,476
<i>My compañero!</i>

187
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,747
- Man!
- What?

188
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:02,849
Whose house is this?

189
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:07,057
That is a good question.
Do you want a beer?

190
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:09,024
- No, I'm cool.
- No?

191
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:18,064
Drink, bitches!

192
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,071
That's disgusting!

193
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,216
Number one clip on YouTube.

194
00:17:43,321 --> 00:17:46,620
- Max!
- I can feel my hit counter rising.

195
00:17:47,091 --> 00:17:48,991
I'm gonna shove that camera up your ass.

196
00:17:49,093 --> 00:17:51,857
- I'm not here.
- Show's over.

197
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:59,693
on the dock.
I swear. It was hilarious.

198
00:17:59,937 --> 00:18:02,906
- Yo, Ryan, what up, man?
- My man, Max.

199
00:18:03,007 --> 00:18:04,440
You know I just came to party.

200
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:07,511
- How's it going? Good.
- Right on.

201
00:18:07,612 --> 00:18:09,512
Hey, this is Jake.

202
00:18:10,114 --> 00:18:12,480
- Ryan McCarthy.
- Jake Tyler.

203
00:18:13,117 --> 00:18:15,711
- It's nice to meet you, man.
- Yeah. You, too.

204
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:19,288
You're from Ohio, right?

205
00:18:19,924 --> 00:18:21,983
Due west. It's Iowa.

206
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:27,392
Iowa... Dan Gable,
greatest Olympic wrestler ever.

207
00:18:27,531 --> 00:18:31,160
Yeah. The '72 games.
He never surrendered a point.

208
00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:32,896
Exactly, man! Water.

209
00:18:33,037 --> 00:18:34,902
Nice catch. Excuse me.

210
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:37,473
So, what do you make of Orlando?

211
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:40,643
Not really sure, man.

212
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:44,539
I hear you.
You know, I've lived here my whole life,

213
00:18:44,649 --> 00:18:46,139
still don't know how I feel.

214
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:50,983
Bro, chicks wearing bikinis year round.
What's not to know?

215
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:54,489
Little man's got a point.
It can't get much better than this.

216
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:14,803
- Unbelievable!
- Yeah, but this ain't it.

217
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,807
<i>This ain't what?
- All this American Pie bullshit.</i>

218
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:22,347
No. The real action is lakeside.

219
00:19:23,687 --> 00:19:26,622
Force times mass equals acceleration.

220
00:19:26,956 --> 00:19:27,923
Fight night!

221
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:40,327
Anyone who wants to fight gets a shot.
Girl on girl.

222
00:19:47,078 --> 00:19:49,069
A little black on brown.

223
00:19:50,214 --> 00:19:53,980
And my personal favorite,
battle of the exes.

224
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:57,952
Yo, crazy bitch.

225
00:19:58,054 --> 00:19:59,715
So, what do you think?

226
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:04,156
This is insane.

227
00:20:05,195 --> 00:20:09,894
- Got anything like this back at home?
- Not even close. Who's in charge?

228
00:20:11,768 --> 00:20:13,326
We are.

229
00:20:32,555 --> 00:20:35,786
So? You ready?

230
00:20:35,892 --> 00:20:37,621
Ready for what?

231
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:41,286
The main event.

232
00:20:42,899 --> 00:20:45,561
That would be me and you.

233
00:20:48,071 --> 00:20:49,800
Get the hell out of here, man.
I'm not fighting.

234
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:55,077
I kind of think you are.

235
00:20:55,211 --> 00:20:56,838
Hey, this is it, fight fans!

236
00:20:56,946 --> 00:21:01,280
Ryan "The Terror" McCarthy
versus Jake "The Gridiron" Tyler.

237
00:21:01,384 --> 00:21:02,351
Yeah!

238
00:21:05,321 --> 00:21:09,883
- Hold on, man.
- Hey, look, if you wanna be the best,

239
00:21:10,093 --> 00:21:12,027
you gotta take out the best.

240
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,690
I don't wanna be the best.

241
00:21:19,636 --> 00:21:21,194
We all saw that video, right?

242
00:21:21,304 --> 00:21:23,067
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

243
00:21:23,173 --> 00:21:25,368
That stuff was tight, man.

244
00:21:25,475 --> 00:21:28,740
Sincerely, okay? One right hook

245
00:21:30,346 --> 00:21:32,211
and the dude was stone.

246
00:21:32,315 --> 00:21:34,909
Hey, Ry, I don't think Iowa's into it.

247
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:41,281
Well, we gotta give the people
what they want.

248
00:21:43,993 --> 00:21:46,325
You guys ready to see something?
- Yeah!

249
00:21:46,429 --> 00:21:48,021
- You?
- Yeah!

250
00:21:48,398 --> 00:21:52,630
I don't want to fight you, man.
I don't want to fight anyone.

251
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:58,101
You don't wanna fight?
Then what the hell are you doing here?

252
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,517
Oh?

253
00:22:24,734 --> 00:22:26,668
This is awkward.

254
00:22:32,108 --> 00:22:33,507
You two have a good night.

255
00:22:36,012 --> 00:22:37,240
Ryan, he's...

256
00:22:37,947 --> 00:22:39,710
Where the hell are you going?

257
00:22:39,849 --> 00:22:41,646
Hold up! Hold up, hold up.

258
00:22:44,754 --> 00:22:48,986
I saw the clip, and you can bang, dude.

259
00:22:49,192 --> 00:22:51,319
You know what they say about the Internet.

260
00:22:51,427 --> 00:22:52,621
Yes, we do.

261
00:22:53,897 --> 00:22:55,865
So none of that stuff is true, then?

262
00:22:57,267 --> 00:23:00,236
Not even that part about your dad

263
00:23:01,337 --> 00:23:04,465
wrapping his drunk ass around that tree?

264
00:23:06,042 --> 00:23:08,101
You know, I can't figure out, though,

265
00:23:09,412 --> 00:23:12,848
is what... What were you doing
in the passenger seat?

266
00:23:13,917 --> 00:23:15,680
Why didn't you just drive?

267
00:23:17,453 --> 00:23:20,286
Wow, talk about dropping the ball there.

268
00:23:28,064 --> 00:23:29,292
Get off of me!

269
00:23:29,399 --> 00:23:32,266
Guess some of that stuff
on the Web is true.

270
00:23:35,772 --> 00:23:38,502
It's okay. You want some gloves, huh?

271
00:23:38,608 --> 00:23:40,769
Yeah. Get the gloves.

272
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:42,177
Yeah!

273
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,877
Come on, baby!

274
00:23:49,152 --> 00:23:51,677
Go to war! Play to win.

275
00:23:52,755 --> 00:23:56,020
All right, calm down, calm down.
Bring it down, bring it down.

276
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:58,184
Fight ends with a knockout or a tap out.

277
00:23:58,361 --> 00:23:59,328
You ready?

278
00:24:00,363 --> 00:24:01,330
You ready?

279
00:24:01,831 --> 00:24:03,321
Get some, baby!

280
00:24:12,542 --> 00:24:13,804
Nice right.

281
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:31,052
Cheap shot, man.

282
00:24:33,896 --> 00:24:36,524
Iowa, that was a cheap one.

283
00:24:37,467 --> 00:24:39,128
But you are good, okay,

284
00:24:39,235 --> 00:24:41,294
and you have a good center of gravity.

285
00:24:41,404 --> 00:24:44,373
But that old-school boxing shit, it just...

286
00:24:44,874 --> 00:24:48,366
I don't know, it doesn't fly around here.
You gotta mix it up...

287
00:24:50,446 --> 00:24:52,744
Stings, right? Bet it does.

288
00:24:56,719 --> 00:25:00,348
Your leg's all jacked up.
Can't put any weight on it, maybe.

289
00:25:03,493 --> 00:25:05,723
Now for the bad news.

290
00:25:06,529 --> 00:25:09,794
It's gotta end with you looking like a bitch

291
00:25:09,899 --> 00:25:12,766
in front of everybody.

292
00:25:26,582 --> 00:25:28,482
My boy's rocking!

293
00:25:28,584 --> 00:25:31,610
- Get up, get up!
- Get up, farmer!

294
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:38,987
- Knockout! It's a knockout!
- Damn!

295
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:56,411
Damn, you're insane. He's getting up.
He's getting up. He's getting up!

296
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:16,425
You sent him to bed.

297
00:26:21,136 --> 00:26:25,702
Dude, stay down. Fight another day, man.

298
00:26:33,247 --> 00:26:34,805
Hey, Ryan!

299
00:26:40,755 --> 00:26:42,484
You ain't got shit.

300
00:27:08,716 --> 00:27:10,581
Don't worry, man. You're gonna be okay.

301
00:27:18,692 --> 00:27:20,057
There's some roaches here.

302
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,971
You want breakfast?

303
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:37,177
Whoa.

304
00:27:40,514 --> 00:27:43,210
- What about the other guy?
- What about him?

305
00:27:43,784 --> 00:27:47,185
- He look worse than you?
- Yeah, maybe before the fight.

306
00:27:49,657 --> 00:27:52,353
Hey, try not to say anything to Mom
about this.

307
00:27:52,626 --> 00:27:53,752
Like I need to.

308
00:27:57,097 --> 00:28:01,158
- Can you find your way to the bus?
- The big yellow thing?

309
00:28:02,336 --> 00:28:03,769
Good man.

310
00:28:07,074 --> 00:28:08,041
Good man.

311
00:28:10,544 --> 00:28:13,035
Oh, my God, that new kid
got his ass handed to him.

312
00:28:13,147 --> 00:28:17,516
The flannel kid, Ryan wrecked the dude.
He kicked his ass.

313
00:28:23,757 --> 00:28:25,725
What's wrong with her?

314
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:34,990
- What do you want, Charlie?
- It's Max Cooperman

315
00:29:36,997 --> 00:29:38,555
and Baja Miller.

316
00:29:40,768 --> 00:29:42,235
Too easy.

317
00:29:48,042 --> 00:29:51,443
- Way to commit to the move.
- What do you want, Max?

318
00:29:52,546 --> 00:29:55,344
Well, you blew off school, man.

319
00:29:55,449 --> 00:29:58,509
Trying to get an early jump
on the weekend.

320
00:29:58,686 --> 00:30:04,682
Look, there wasn't a lot you could do, man.
I mean, Ryan, he's got crazy skills.

321
00:30:04,792 --> 00:30:08,728
His dad's a psychopath.
He had him in karate before he could crawl.

322
00:30:08,829 --> 00:30:13,664
But you, dude. You had heart.
It's inspiring even.

323
00:30:16,937 --> 00:30:18,370
What's that?

324
00:30:18,472 --> 00:30:22,067
This is just some of the best
mixed martial arts you'll ever see.

325
00:30:22,176 --> 00:30:24,041
I told you I'm not into that UFC stuff.

326
00:30:24,144 --> 00:30:26,772
Yeah, I got that impression last night.

327
00:30:27,314 --> 00:30:31,546
Look, man, you gotta throw in some
Muay Thai, you know. Have a ground game.

328
00:30:31,819 --> 00:30:35,721
Which is why I'm extending
this invitation to you again.

329
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:41,493
Dudes on that disk all train with the guy
I told you about.

330
00:30:41,595 --> 00:30:43,688
My teacher, Jean Roqua.

331
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:48,825
All right, and with some technique,
bro, you can do what I can never do.

332
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:51,497
Achieve greatness.

333
00:30:53,073 --> 00:30:55,064
Achieve an exit, please.

334
00:30:55,309 --> 00:30:59,006
Dude, you're gonna tell me last night
didn't leave you twisted?

335
00:30:59,146 --> 00:31:02,377
- Nope.
- Nobody can get their ass beat like that

336
00:31:02,483 --> 00:31:05,008
- and not care.
- I can.

337
00:31:07,287 --> 00:31:10,120
- Well, then hide in here.
- Maybe I will.

338
00:31:10,457 --> 00:31:12,084
I bet under the bed's pretty safe, bro.

339
00:31:12,192 --> 00:31:14,558
- You know, I bet it is.
- Whatever, dude.

340
00:31:42,556 --> 00:31:44,888
Cool, man! How'd you find the club?

341
00:31:46,527 --> 00:31:50,588
- The address on the DVD. It was real subtle.
- Yeah, hey, check it out. That's Roqua.

342
00:31:50,697 --> 00:31:53,962
In trouble? Change your position.
Now, see, you got me.

343
00:31:54,301 --> 00:31:56,428
It's hurting me, hurting me.

344
00:32:00,474 --> 00:32:03,068
Right? And squeeze.

345
00:32:04,578 --> 00:32:07,741
Whoa, dude, dude, dude, the shoes!
Take your shoes off.

346
00:32:10,217 --> 00:32:16,417
Mr. Roqua, Mr. Roqua,
I'd like you to meet Jake Tyler.

347
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:19,058
He's interested in taking classes here.

348
00:32:21,495 --> 00:32:25,295
People who come here
for the wrong reasons, they never last.

349
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,702
- Walked into a door.
- Must have been a big door.

350
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:36,933
- So when can I start?
- Tomorrow, with Max. Beginner's class.

351
00:32:37,544 --> 00:32:40,879
- It's just labels, dude.
- What about this class?

352
00:32:42,316 --> 00:32:45,843
This is not for beginners.
This is an advanced class.

353
00:32:45,953 --> 00:32:50,049
- You can observe, if you like. Max?
- But he's got mad skills, sir.

354
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:51,416
Please.

355
00:32:54,895 --> 00:32:56,487
I'm a quick learner.

356
00:32:59,566 --> 00:33:03,434
Everyone up! Circuit one! Let's go.

357
00:33:05,772 --> 00:33:08,138
- What do I do?
- Learn quickly.

358
00:33:08,775 --> 00:33:12,871
One-minute intervals. Begin!

359
00:33:18,352 --> 00:33:19,944
Breathe!

360
00:33:23,257 --> 00:33:26,852
Section two. Time! Switch! Let's go.

361
00:33:31,064 --> 00:33:32,326
Grab the rings, bro!

362
00:33:34,401 --> 00:33:38,337
Push yourself. Pick it up, buddy. Let's go.

363
00:33:41,575 --> 00:33:43,770
Time. Rotation. Let's go!

364
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:49,606
Come on! Pick it up, people.

365
00:33:55,189 --> 00:33:56,713
Come on!

366
00:33:58,525 --> 00:34:02,291
Pick it up! Time! Switch! Let's go.

367
00:34:05,966 --> 00:34:06,933
Breathe!

368
00:34:09,937 --> 00:34:12,929
Keep going! Don't give up. Never give up.

369
00:34:13,473 --> 00:34:16,340
Never back down. Come on, pick it up.

370
00:34:17,678 --> 00:34:19,270
Push yourself!

371
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:27,318
Okay.

372
00:34:28,055 --> 00:34:29,022
Time!

373
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,526
Don't compact your muscles now,
we're just getting warmed up.

374
00:34:40,434 --> 00:34:41,901
That was a warm up?

375
00:34:42,002 --> 00:34:46,564
Pair up. Go for the submission.
Three-minute rounds.

376
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,900
Miles.

377
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:52,039
Are you kidding me?

378
00:34:52,346 --> 00:34:55,076
- I got 20 pounds on this guy.
- So take it easy on him.

379
00:35:11,865 --> 00:35:13,093
Tap out.

380
00:35:18,438 --> 00:35:20,838
Shoot the legs. Take his back!

381
00:35:25,178 --> 00:35:27,908
Good use of your chin to block his knees.

382
00:35:33,487 --> 00:35:35,114
Rear naked choke!

383
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:39,684
- Tap out, dude!
- Tap out, tap out.

384
00:35:51,471 --> 00:35:53,769
He's out. He's out, let him go.

385
00:35:54,975 --> 00:35:56,374
You all right?

386
00:35:57,044 --> 00:35:59,137
That wasn't so smart, buddy.

387
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,780
Couple of more seconds,
I would've had him.

388
00:36:01,882 --> 00:36:03,850
You don't give up, do you?

389
00:36:04,751 --> 00:36:07,117
Tomorrow at 6:00. Don't be late.

390
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:12,080
One rule, Jake.

391
00:36:12,326 --> 00:36:14,419
No fighting outside the gym.

392
00:36:14,728 --> 00:36:17,629
No matter what, no matter who,
no matter how big the door.

393
00:36:17,731 --> 00:36:20,825
No fighting or you're out.
Can you handle that?

394
00:36:21,935 --> 00:36:22,993
Yeah.

395
00:36:24,604 --> 00:36:25,571
See you tomorrow.

396
00:36:27,074 --> 00:36:28,598
That was amazing.

397
00:36:28,942 --> 00:36:30,136
Oh, my God!

398
00:36:30,243 --> 00:36:32,177
- It's no big deal.
- No big deal?

399
00:36:32,279 --> 00:36:34,179
Are you kidding me?
The man put you on the rack!

400
00:36:34,281 --> 00:36:37,648
He tested you and you passed
with flying colors, man!

401
00:36:38,652 --> 00:36:42,144
Ass-kicking, skull-crushing,
mixed martial arts madness!

402
00:36:42,255 --> 00:36:43,722
You're gonna bring it on!

403
00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:51,627
- Dude, where you going?
- Bus.

404
00:36:52,532 --> 00:36:54,056
Get in the car.

405
00:36:56,036 --> 00:36:57,663
This is your car?

406
00:36:58,405 --> 00:36:59,497
No.

407
00:37:00,674 --> 00:37:02,141
It's my baby.

408
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,512
I got it.

409
00:37:15,822 --> 00:37:16,789
Wow.

410
00:37:17,624 --> 00:37:18,682
Hey.

411
00:37:22,295 --> 00:37:23,523
Hey, Jake.

412
00:37:23,997 --> 00:37:25,362
Come on in.

413
00:37:31,938 --> 00:37:34,270
Hey, could you give us a second?

414
00:37:35,208 --> 00:37:38,974
- I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
- Whatever she did, accept.

415
00:37:40,547 --> 00:37:41,775
Go away.

416
00:37:42,883 --> 00:37:43,975
Well?

417
00:37:46,052 --> 00:37:49,818
- You set me up.
- I get that. I do, but...

418
00:37:49,923 --> 00:37:54,917
You set me up so that your boyfriend could
kick my ass in front of half the school.

419
00:37:55,695 --> 00:37:57,526
I didn't know it would be like that.

420
00:37:58,965 --> 00:38:00,660
I said I was sorry.

421
00:38:03,437 --> 00:38:04,904
It was wrong.

422
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,337
Are you so different?

423
00:38:09,309 --> 00:38:11,277
You wanted that fight.

424
00:38:12,479 --> 00:38:14,242
You just didn't want to lose it.

425
00:38:15,081 --> 00:38:16,878
You know, you better watch out,

426
00:38:16,983 --> 00:38:19,383
because you're starting
to sound real smart.

427
00:38:24,858 --> 00:38:26,325
My old school.

428
00:38:28,462 --> 00:38:32,091
I was barely there a month.
Third time we moved that year.

429
00:38:33,166 --> 00:38:36,465
My dad got transferred here,
and then Ryan happened,

430
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:39,300
and everything just got so easy.

431
00:38:45,479 --> 00:38:49,108
Does that mean I'm supposed to feel
sorry for you because you're popular?

432
00:38:58,658 --> 00:39:00,387
Sounds like my cue.

433
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:20,675
Hey. First class isn't for an hour.

434
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:23,214
I could use the extra work, remember?

435
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,812
Okay.

436
00:39:38,932 --> 00:39:41,526
This should be enough for two months.

437
00:39:42,402 --> 00:39:44,597
- That's a lot of money.
- Yeah.

438
00:39:44,704 --> 00:39:46,399
Sure it's worth it?

439
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,437
Never been more sure.

440
00:39:59,052 --> 00:40:00,815
So, do you live here?

441
00:40:01,888 --> 00:40:04,186
I thought you came to work out.

442
00:40:18,905 --> 00:40:20,532
Add a round kick.

443
00:40:21,241 --> 00:40:24,108
No, that's cool.
I'm gonna do my own thing till class starts.

444
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:28,772
Three-punch combo, then a round kick.
This is mixed martial arts. Mix it up.

445
00:40:36,623 --> 00:40:39,217
You beat yourself
if you don't control your breathing.

446
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:44,626
Your first day sparring with Miles,
you panicked, stopped breathing.

447
00:40:44,731 --> 00:40:47,564
Here you are trying so hard to kill the bag,
but you forget to breathe,

448
00:40:47,667 --> 00:40:49,692
so your kick has no power.

449
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:52,861
Breathe with each strike.

450
00:40:58,745 --> 00:40:59,973
Breathe.

451
00:41:02,015 --> 00:41:04,483
- Breathe.
- I am breathing!

452
00:41:04,584 --> 00:41:06,552
If you can't keep control
when you're kicking a bag,

453
00:41:06,653 --> 00:41:08,678
what happens against an
opponent who can fight back?

454
00:41:08,788 --> 00:41:11,086
This bag weighs a frigging ton.

455
00:41:30,977 --> 00:41:32,968
Each strike, you breathe.

456
00:41:37,584 --> 00:41:39,779
- So is that it?
- Is that what?

457
00:41:41,721 --> 00:41:45,680
Your "Grasshopper" speech.
All I get is four words about breathing?

458
00:41:48,628 --> 00:41:50,619
Still sure it's worth it?

459
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:03,967
Not just you, Jake. Everyone has their fight.

460
00:43:19,085 --> 00:43:20,575
Nice work.

461
00:43:54,487 --> 00:43:55,977
- Jake?
- Hey.

462
00:43:58,057 --> 00:44:01,117
- Charlie had a match today.
- Yeah? How'd he do?

463
00:44:01,795 --> 00:44:05,094
Level of competition here,
it's going to take some getting used to.

464
00:44:05,932 --> 00:44:07,593
You should come sometime.

465
00:44:10,837 --> 00:44:12,634
That was Dad's thing.

466
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,965
Did you take $200
out of your bank account, Jake?

467
00:44:18,812 --> 00:44:20,404
Hey, I asked you a question.

468
00:44:21,314 --> 00:44:23,714
Did you take $200
out of your bank account?

469
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:28,846
- Yeah.
- For what?

470
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:33,024
It's my money.
What difference does it make?

471
00:44:33,126 --> 00:44:34,787
What did you spend it on?

472
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:39,191
What's in the bag?

473
00:44:43,636 --> 00:44:45,399
Open the bag, please.

474
00:45:01,221 --> 00:45:03,189
- You've been fighting?
- I knew you wouldn't understand.

475
00:45:03,289 --> 00:45:04,756
You know, this is over.

476
00:45:05,258 --> 00:45:06,350
Done.

477
00:45:08,094 --> 00:45:09,561
Are we clear?

478
00:46:00,013 --> 00:46:03,210
Today we're gonna try something new.
A collective narrative.

479
00:46:05,084 --> 00:46:06,676
I'm gonna break you up
into groups of three.

480
00:46:06,819 --> 00:46:09,310
Suzanne, Elise and Corey,
you're one group.

481
00:46:09,422 --> 00:46:11,253
Lydia will be a group for me.

482
00:46:11,357 --> 00:46:13,882
Ms. Miller, Mr. Tyler will be a group.

483
00:46:14,661 --> 00:46:16,219
You three here.

484
00:46:18,164 --> 00:46:20,894
So what do you guys want to write about?

485
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,861
How about pride?

486
00:46:25,471 --> 00:46:26,699
Betrayal.

487
00:46:29,042 --> 00:46:30,441
Exoneration.

488
00:46:30,677 --> 00:46:31,974
Treachery.

489
00:46:32,845 --> 00:46:33,971
Sequaciousness.

490
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,945
That's bullshit. That's not even a word.

491
00:46:36,049 --> 00:46:40,213
Yeah, it is. It's go with the flow,
and it's used quite well, I might add.

492
00:46:40,787 --> 00:46:43,051
Why do you have to be such a jerk?

493
00:46:43,156 --> 00:46:47,718
- Yeah, this is my fault.
- It wasn't, but you're making it that way.

494
00:46:50,997 --> 00:46:52,362
Unrequited?

495
00:47:01,307 --> 00:47:02,604
What's up, Baja?

496
00:47:04,877 --> 00:47:06,367
What's up, babe?

497
00:47:11,684 --> 00:47:13,777
- We need to talk.
- So talk.

498
00:47:16,055 --> 00:47:18,455
Are you sure you want to do this here?

499
00:47:20,393 --> 00:47:21,758
Pretty sure.

500
00:47:22,695 --> 00:47:26,426
Your fight with Jake Tyler was horrible.

501
00:47:26,532 --> 00:47:27,726
Really?

502
00:47:28,501 --> 00:47:29,968
I thought it was a pretty good party.

503
00:47:30,069 --> 00:47:31,093
You said you were just
gonna spar with him.

504
00:47:31,204 --> 00:47:33,468
And then we sparred,
and then I kicked his ass.

505
00:47:33,573 --> 00:47:34,733
What is the deal?

506
00:47:35,041 --> 00:47:36,372
It's over.

507
00:47:37,076 --> 00:47:38,976
You can't be serious.

508
00:47:39,412 --> 00:47:40,742
I'm sorry.

509
00:47:42,181 --> 00:47:44,911
Because I gave
some random kid a beating?

510
00:47:46,486 --> 00:47:47,851
And loved it.

511
00:47:49,288 --> 00:47:51,756
The only time you're happy
is when you're hurting people.

512
00:47:51,891 --> 00:47:52,858
Wow.

513
00:47:55,361 --> 00:47:59,229
Are you so self-righteous
that you actually believe that?

514
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,259
You know, when you moved here,
you were nothing.

515
00:48:03,369 --> 00:48:05,769
You'd walk the halls like a ghost.

516
00:48:06,806 --> 00:48:08,706
Being with me made you.

517
00:48:09,642 --> 00:48:12,270
Thank you for making this so much easier.

518
00:48:16,082 --> 00:48:19,574
- Don't do this to me.
- Ryan. Ryan, you're hurting me!

519
00:48:19,685 --> 00:48:21,084
So do I look happy?

520
00:48:23,356 --> 00:48:24,618
Hey, hey!

521
00:48:25,458 --> 00:48:28,985
- What are you going to do about it?
- Jake, no.

522
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:33,855
You're weak like your old man

523
00:48:34,133 --> 00:48:35,566
was.

524
00:48:36,569 --> 00:48:38,332
Watch your back, man.

525
00:48:41,774 --> 00:48:44,470
Half-speed, both of you. Switch partners.

526
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:53,617
Forget half-speed.
You need to put it in neutral.

527
00:48:53,719 --> 00:48:56,483
- What? I eased off.
- Okay, let's see it.

528
00:49:03,496 --> 00:49:06,727
Clear your head. Let it go.
Easy, nice and easy.

529
00:49:07,867 --> 00:49:10,267
- Just giving it as good as I get it.
- Really?

530
00:49:10,369 --> 00:49:12,462
Should I go half-speed, too?

531
00:49:13,339 --> 00:49:14,704
Whatever.

532
00:49:25,251 --> 00:49:28,448
You're so set on hurting people,
you just hurt yourself.

533
00:49:28,554 --> 00:49:30,317
- Easy, buddy.
- So this is my fault, huh?

534
00:49:30,423 --> 00:49:33,756
Yes. It is your responsibility
to control the outcome.

535
00:49:33,993 --> 00:49:36,393
- That is such bullshit.
- Bullshit?

536
00:49:37,063 --> 00:49:38,928
Okay, show me your way.

537
00:49:49,041 --> 00:49:51,134
Tap out. Calm down, buddy.

538
00:49:53,045 --> 00:49:54,842
Go home and cool off.

539
00:49:55,982 --> 00:49:57,711
Tomorrow is another day.

540
00:50:02,321 --> 00:50:05,381
- At least I have a home.
- What did you say to me?

541
00:50:05,491 --> 00:50:09,757
- I said, "At least I have a home".
- Then go to it. I'll see you tomorrow.

542
00:50:14,901 --> 00:50:17,802
- Maybe I should check on him?
- Yeah, you do that.

543
00:50:19,705 --> 00:50:22,037
Hold up, dude! Slow down.
Where are you going?

544
00:50:22,141 --> 00:50:23,637
Let's just go.

545
00:50:38,191 --> 00:50:39,681
You okay, dude?

546
00:50:40,059 --> 00:50:41,788
My responsibility.

547
00:50:43,596 --> 00:50:44,688
Jake?

548
00:50:58,544 --> 00:50:59,943
Dude, relax.

549
00:51:08,487 --> 00:51:11,479
- You got a problem, tough guy?
- Yeah, I do got a problem.

550
00:51:13,658 --> 00:51:14,556
Jake, be cool.

551
00:51:16,027 --> 00:51:18,291
Hey, get back in the car, faggot.

552
00:51:18,292 --> 00:51:20,564
What are you gonna do about it?

553
00:51:55,733 --> 00:51:56,700
Let's go!

554
00:52:19,824 --> 00:52:21,314
That's Jake Tyler.

555
00:52:27,999 --> 00:52:30,331
Yo, Harry, check this out.
This is sick. Three dudes.

556
00:52:30,434 --> 00:52:33,028
I heard one of them almost died. Look.

557
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:34,194
Get out of here, man. Whatever.

558
00:52:34,305 --> 00:52:36,933
No, seriously, I heard Tyler hit the kid
so hard his heart stopped.

559
00:52:37,041 --> 00:52:40,169
- That's in a Bruce Lee movie, you idiot.
- You're an idiot. Shut up.

560
00:52:40,277 --> 00:52:42,973
- You guys sound like a bunch of bitches.
- He's a bitch.

561
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,274
That was a good comeback, dude.

562
00:52:44,382 --> 00:52:47,283
You know, it's funny. I just had a
conversation with your brother about that.

563
00:52:47,385 --> 00:52:48,352
Ask him.

564
00:52:48,452 --> 00:52:50,443
How well do you know Jake?

565
00:52:50,654 --> 00:52:52,121
- We're tight.
- Really?

566
00:52:52,223 --> 00:52:55,750
Yeah, but it's more of
a professional relationship, though.

567
00:52:56,193 --> 00:52:58,559
- I'm his trainer.
- Cool. Awesome.

568
00:52:59,296 --> 00:53:00,320
Tell me more.

569
00:53:00,431 --> 00:53:01,398
- More?
- Yeah.

570
00:53:04,068 --> 00:53:05,194
Happy?

571
00:53:07,371 --> 00:53:10,898
- What are you talking about?
- You're a rock star now.

572
00:53:14,845 --> 00:53:16,437
Why would you care?

573
00:53:22,586 --> 00:53:24,076
Good question.

574
00:53:26,824 --> 00:53:30,157
Well, looks like hotshot found himself
a new groupie, huh?

575
00:53:51,682 --> 00:53:53,582
How's it going, badass?

576
00:53:55,886 --> 00:53:57,854
You think I'm impressed?

577
00:54:05,629 --> 00:54:08,826
Couple of wannabes in a yellow Hummer?

578
00:54:09,567 --> 00:54:11,899
I could wreck you here and now.

579
00:54:14,071 --> 00:54:17,507
What fun would that be?
This is a spectator sport.

580
00:54:19,043 --> 00:54:22,103
You think you can make it through
the Beatdown?

581
00:54:22,813 --> 00:54:23,802
I have.

582
00:54:23,914 --> 00:54:26,348
Won the whole tournament twice.

583
00:54:27,518 --> 00:54:29,179
That's where we'll get it on.

584
00:54:30,254 --> 00:54:32,154
That's where this ends.

585
00:54:39,730 --> 00:54:41,220
Not impressed.

586
00:54:42,133 --> 00:54:43,794
Not even a little.

587
00:54:44,702 --> 00:54:46,294
Enjoy the floor.

588
00:55:09,927 --> 00:55:12,691
- Dude, where you going?
- Home.

589
00:55:13,697 --> 00:55:15,494
Did you forget I drove?

590
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:16,998
I'm walking.

591
00:55:17,535 --> 00:55:18,797
Barely.

592
00:55:20,304 --> 00:55:21,566
You okay?

593
00:55:23,174 --> 00:55:24,402
What's the Beatdown?

594
00:55:27,211 --> 00:55:28,405
Get in.

595
00:55:34,885 --> 00:55:37,445
Straight up elimination tournament, dude.

596
00:55:37,555 --> 00:55:40,046
The freaking Super Bowl
of the Florida fight clubs.

597
00:55:40,357 --> 00:55:43,121
Everybody who brawls,
they go to the Beatdown.

598
00:55:43,227 --> 00:55:45,058
It's gladiator heaven.

599
00:55:58,658 --> 00:55:59,750
When?

600
00:56:01,928 --> 00:56:03,088
Like, sometime next month, man.

601
00:56:03,196 --> 00:56:05,096
The fighters get the time and place
by text message

602
00:56:05,198 --> 00:56:06,495
at the last minute.

603
00:56:11,938 --> 00:56:15,135
Dude, do all you guys live
in houses this big?

604
00:56:15,241 --> 00:56:17,265
Bro, this is our guest house.

605
00:56:28,588 --> 00:56:29,555
Push over.

606
00:56:41,934 --> 00:56:43,401
What are you doing?

607
00:56:44,737 --> 00:56:47,035
- Training.
- Take off your gloves.

608
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:50,932
- I just...
- Take off your gloves.

609
00:56:51,744 --> 00:56:54,611
Fight outside the gym and you're done.
Go right now.

610
00:56:54,714 --> 00:56:57,706
You don't train here anymore.
Out of my sight.

611
00:57:09,028 --> 00:57:10,086
Out!

612
00:57:19,338 --> 00:57:21,169
Want to tell me
who did this to you, Charlie?

613
00:57:21,274 --> 00:57:23,708
- Not a big deal.
- It is a big deal.

614
00:57:23,843 --> 00:57:25,504
It's not like you.

615
00:57:27,447 --> 00:57:30,280
- What about the other guy?
- What about him?

616
00:57:32,852 --> 00:57:36,083
You think this is funny, Jake?
This is all your fault.

617
00:57:36,189 --> 00:57:38,123
- How is that?
- Well, all this business with fighting.

618
00:57:38,224 --> 00:57:39,919
You're the one who's supposed to be
setting the example.

619
00:57:40,026 --> 00:57:42,085
- I thought that was your job.
- Well, I am trying,

620
00:57:42,195 --> 00:57:44,425
but all he wants is to be you.

621
00:57:44,997 --> 00:57:46,897
You think you're the only one
who gets angry, Jake?

622
00:57:46,999 --> 00:57:48,660
You think you're the only one
who wants to break stuff?

623
00:57:48,768 --> 00:57:50,030
I'd like to break stuff, too!

624
00:57:55,274 --> 00:57:57,799
- Want to try that, Charlie?
- You sure?

625
00:57:58,211 --> 00:58:00,008
Yeah, go on, break it.

626
00:58:03,716 --> 00:58:05,616
- You feel better?
- Yeah.

627
00:58:06,686 --> 00:58:08,984
How about you, Mom? Feel better?

628
00:58:09,355 --> 00:58:10,481
Yeah, I do.

629
00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:12,717
But guess what, there's still a mess
that needs to be cleaned up,

630
00:58:12,825 --> 00:58:15,191
and that is my job.

631
00:58:15,294 --> 00:58:16,625
I can help.
- No, it's all right.

632
00:58:16,729 --> 00:58:18,253
Get out of here, both of you.

633
00:58:22,201 --> 00:58:23,862
It wasn't a fight.

634
00:58:25,738 --> 00:58:27,035
I got hit with a ball.

635
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:30,038
It was an overhead,
and I took my eye off of it.

636
00:58:30,643 --> 00:58:31,940
I'm sorry I lied, Mom.

637
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:36,443
I thought it sounded cooler
if I got in a fight.

638
00:58:42,288 --> 00:58:45,451
Still think you don't need to
set an example, Jake?

639
00:59:40,213 --> 00:59:41,942
Isn't this a little stalker-ish?

640
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:47,713
Yes, but he's not going to let you
in the gym,

641
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:50,482
so we gotta go outside.

642
00:59:52,258 --> 00:59:53,486
Outside?

643
00:59:55,194 --> 00:59:58,630
Dude, it's called 365 Combat for a reason.
He never leaves.

644
00:59:58,731 --> 01:00:00,596
Well, he's gotta leave sometime.

645
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:03,134
Come on, dude. I mean,
we got to get you back in there, man.

646
01:00:03,236 --> 01:00:04,533
We need to be training.

647
01:00:05,137 --> 01:00:08,129
- We?
- I don't go back until you go back.

648
01:00:12,945 --> 01:00:13,912
Cool.

649
01:00:14,814 --> 01:00:16,111
Whoa, he's leaving.

650
01:00:16,215 --> 01:00:17,682
Let's go, baby, let's go.

651
01:00:36,598 --> 01:00:38,930
I lied, the first class.

652
01:00:39,301 --> 01:00:43,237
I had every intention
of fighting outside the gym.

653
01:00:44,473 --> 01:00:45,770
Is this your apology?

654
01:00:49,745 --> 01:00:53,078
Okay, I lied because I wanted
to pound on the guy

655
01:00:53,182 --> 01:00:54,672
that was pounding on me.

656
01:00:56,285 --> 01:00:59,584
This guy, he's got the perfect life,

657
01:00:59,688 --> 01:01:02,179
the perfect car, the perfect girlfriend.

658
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:04,087
You know,

659
01:01:04,793 --> 01:01:06,556
I lied because I'm pissed off,

660
01:01:07,463 --> 01:01:09,454
because I'm angry all the time.

661
01:01:11,867 --> 01:01:12,834
I just...

662
01:01:14,636 --> 01:01:17,104
I just had to say no, and I blew it.

663
01:01:17,773 --> 01:01:20,571
That's all I needed to do, and I couldn't.

664
01:01:21,977 --> 01:01:22,944
My dad, he was...

665
01:01:24,012 --> 01:01:26,173
He was completely wasted, he was tanked.

666
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:29,212
He wanted to drive.

667
01:01:31,253 --> 01:01:32,743
And I let him.

668
01:01:33,555 --> 01:01:37,116
He went off the road,

669
01:01:38,794 --> 01:01:39,783
hit a tree.

670
01:01:42,831 --> 01:01:43,820
I made it.

671
01:01:44,566 --> 01:01:45,533
He didn't.

672
01:01:47,703 --> 01:01:51,605
I've just been letting my mom down,
my brother down,

673
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:54,104
getting into fights.

674
01:01:54,576 --> 01:01:56,305
I don't want to be angry anymore.

675
01:01:57,479 --> 01:01:59,470
The only time I'm not is...

676
01:02:01,717 --> 01:02:05,050
It's when I'm in the gym
and I'm training with you.

677
01:02:10,392 --> 01:02:12,292
Be at the gym at 7:00.

678
01:02:14,596 --> 01:02:15,756
Thank you.

679
01:02:16,465 --> 01:02:18,262
You won't be thanking me tomorrow.

680
01:03:36,044 --> 01:03:37,238
That was not cool.

681
01:04:26,428 --> 01:04:27,656
Tap out.

682
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:30,288
That's what I'm talking about.

683
01:04:40,175 --> 01:04:41,142
Yes!

684
01:04:58,894 --> 01:05:03,263
What's with the gym being open every day,
all year?

685
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:06,426
And why do you live there?

686
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:10,333
Where's your family?

687
01:05:12,274 --> 01:05:14,606
Come on, I won the race.
You owe me something.

688
01:05:15,944 --> 01:05:17,036
Okay.

689
01:05:18,513 --> 01:05:22,506
My father moved from Senegal to Brazil
when I was very little.

690
01:05:24,786 --> 01:05:28,586
My father was proud to open
a little street corner restaurant,

691
01:05:28,857 --> 01:05:32,315
but he was even more proud
of my little brother, Joseph.

692
01:05:32,527 --> 01:05:35,758
Right from the start, he was 10 times
the fighter I could ever dream of being.

693
01:05:35,864 --> 01:05:40,824
I mean, we fought professionally,
but Joseph was truly great.

694
01:05:43,238 --> 01:05:45,729
We were at a local bar, Joseph and I,

695
01:05:46,808 --> 01:05:48,332
and this guy

696
01:05:49,378 --> 01:05:51,312
started mouthing off to Joseph,

697
01:05:51,413 --> 01:05:52,903
saying ugly things to him.

698
01:05:53,415 --> 01:05:57,181
Wanted to prove his manhood, I guess,
by taking on a pro, you know?

699
01:05:57,285 --> 01:05:58,877
So I wanted to stop him.

700
01:05:58,987 --> 01:06:02,115
I wanted to put this loudmouth in his place
and end this ugly talk.

701
01:06:02,224 --> 01:06:04,124
But, of course, Joseph,

702
01:06:05,627 --> 01:06:07,026
he beat him.

703
01:06:09,931 --> 01:06:13,059
This local tough guy was
so badly humiliated

704
01:06:14,536 --> 01:06:16,504
he left with his friends.

705
01:06:17,939 --> 01:06:20,339
He then returned 10 minutes later

706
01:06:21,977 --> 01:06:24,104
and shot Joseph in the head.

707
01:06:28,383 --> 01:06:30,374
My father's favorite son.

708
01:06:33,588 --> 01:06:37,581
- I couldn't face him after that.
- So you haven't seen your father since.

709
01:06:43,064 --> 01:06:44,122
Anyways,

710
01:06:44,533 --> 01:06:46,125
you beat me once.

711
01:06:46,468 --> 01:06:48,493
Think you can do it again?

712
01:06:49,738 --> 01:06:50,705
Well,

713
01:06:51,406 --> 01:06:53,738
I don't want to hurt an old man.

714
01:06:56,344 --> 01:06:57,538
Come on, old man!

715
01:07:06,054 --> 01:07:08,921
You have no way to win here.
Stop fighting back.

716
01:07:09,024 --> 01:07:10,719
Change it up. Go for position.

717
01:07:10,826 --> 01:07:12,225
Trap my arm.

718
01:07:13,428 --> 01:07:14,395
My leg here.

719
01:07:15,297 --> 01:07:17,390
Now bridge and roll me over.

720
01:07:19,668 --> 01:07:21,898
Now you have a chance to get in position.

721
01:07:27,609 --> 01:07:29,133
A small chance.

722
01:07:39,087 --> 01:07:42,853
Okay, okay, okay, okay, you win, you win.
You win.

723
01:07:43,058 --> 01:07:44,252
I get it.

724
01:07:44,359 --> 01:07:48,819
But you can't always change position.
I mean, sometimes you just get stuck.

725
01:07:48,997 --> 01:07:51,090
In any fight, you can always
change your position.

726
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:52,825
You just have to find a way.

727
01:07:55,570 --> 01:07:57,868
- So it's on me?
- Always has been.

728
01:07:59,007 --> 01:08:00,201
Always.

729
01:08:11,219 --> 01:08:12,186
<i>Deuce.</i>

730
01:08:16,958 --> 01:08:18,482
How's he doing?

731
01:08:19,794 --> 01:08:22,092
He's down 3-2 in the first set.

732
01:08:22,998 --> 01:08:24,397
Hey, Charlie!

733
01:08:24,699 --> 01:08:26,599
I thought you wanted to go to Wimbledon!

734
01:08:26,701 --> 01:08:27,690
You got this!

735
01:08:27,802 --> 01:08:28,769
<i>Quiet, please.</i>

736
01:08:33,141 --> 01:08:34,506
That was subtle.

737
01:08:35,377 --> 01:08:36,344
Yeah.

738
01:08:36,978 --> 01:08:38,377
It's not our strong suit.

739
01:08:39,681 --> 01:08:40,648
<i>Deuce.</i>

740
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:44,878
- I want to make things better, Jake.
- Don't worry.

741
01:08:45,587 --> 01:08:47,452
- Everything's fine.
- No, it's not.

742
01:08:48,323 --> 01:08:51,315
- We're significantly screwed up.
- No, we're

743
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:54,328
tremendously screwed up.

744
01:08:55,931 --> 01:08:56,898
Yeah!

745
01:09:00,368 --> 01:09:01,335
There you go.

746
01:09:01,570 --> 01:09:03,401
I'm just grabbing a seat over there.

747
01:09:08,209 --> 01:09:09,267
Hey.

748
01:09:10,245 --> 01:09:12,736
I was thinking about what you said.

749
01:09:13,915 --> 01:09:14,973
And?

750
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:18,344
I think that was total bullshit, what you did.

751
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:19,587
Wow.

752
01:09:20,422 --> 01:09:22,617
This is going better than I ever expected.

753
01:09:25,293 --> 01:09:26,260
But

754
01:09:29,898 --> 01:09:32,628
I was the one who took the bait, okay?

755
01:09:33,835 --> 01:09:34,927
I chose to fight.

756
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:39,398
You tried to apologize,
and I acted like an asshole.

757
01:09:40,542 --> 01:09:42,237
You had nothing to do with that.

758
01:10:10,138 --> 01:10:11,264
Thank you.

759
01:10:15,176 --> 01:10:16,768
Apologies are good.

760
01:10:19,914 --> 01:10:22,678
Yeah, they are.

761
01:10:25,587 --> 01:10:27,885
Anything else you need to apologize for?

762
01:10:30,959 --> 01:10:33,154
It's a long list.

763
01:10:50,412 --> 01:10:51,902
Hello, can I help you?

764
01:10:52,047 --> 01:10:54,413
My son Jake trains here.

765
01:10:55,183 --> 01:10:56,810
- Jake Tyler.
- Yes, he does.

766
01:10:58,119 --> 01:10:59,643
Your son is a very good fighter.

767
01:10:59,754 --> 01:11:01,915
Something every mother longs to hear.

768
01:11:02,691 --> 01:11:05,216
Jake is much more than just
a very good fighter.

769
01:11:05,326 --> 01:11:08,818
Is that what you say about all
the angry young men that pay your bills?

770
01:11:10,598 --> 01:11:12,589
They're a lot less angry
when they walk out of here

771
01:11:12,701 --> 01:11:14,134
than when they walk in.

772
01:11:15,770 --> 01:11:16,737
Okay.

773
01:11:17,872 --> 01:11:18,998
That's fair.

774
01:11:20,141 --> 01:11:21,870
When I first met Jake, I thought,

775
01:11:22,744 --> 01:11:26,544
"Here's another kid who has a hard time
dealing with his own emotions".

776
01:11:27,782 --> 01:11:29,875
But now I see he's just afraid of them.

777
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:35,753
I know that Jake thinks
I somehow hold him responsible

778
01:11:35,857 --> 01:11:37,688
for the death of his father.

779
01:11:38,259 --> 01:11:39,283
Do you?

780
01:11:49,871 --> 01:11:52,237
This is for next month.

781
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:58,639
- Thank you.
- Just do me one favor.

782
01:11:59,447 --> 01:12:00,971
Make sure he keeps all his teeth.

783
01:12:01,082 --> 01:12:03,778
My dental plan doesn't kick in
for another six months.

784
01:12:06,421 --> 01:12:09,185
Here, a mouth guard.

785
01:12:09,290 --> 01:12:10,621
My dental plan.

786
01:12:12,527 --> 01:12:13,516
Thank you.

787
01:12:16,664 --> 01:12:18,154
Jake is a good kid.

788
01:12:19,067 --> 01:12:20,034
I know he is.

789
01:12:34,048 --> 01:12:37,415
It's on, dude. Beatdown is tomorrow night.

790
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:40,979
I don't think I'm gonna do that, man.

791
01:12:42,290 --> 01:12:43,985
Yeah, man. Right.

792
01:12:44,092 --> 01:12:47,493
No, really. I'm serious.

793
01:12:47,862 --> 01:12:49,989
I'm not gonna fight at the Beatdown.

794
01:12:51,099 --> 01:12:52,066
What?

795
01:12:52,801 --> 01:12:55,201
- Why not?
- Because that's what Ryan wants.

796
01:12:55,804 --> 01:12:56,771
Not me.

797
01:12:57,705 --> 01:12:58,672
Dude.

798
01:13:00,108 --> 01:13:01,837
I'm sorry, man. Come on.

799
01:13:02,443 --> 01:13:04,911
Let's just grab a seat with the girls.

800
01:13:05,413 --> 01:13:09,281
I mean, Baja's friend has been
checking you out all afternoon.

801
01:13:10,118 --> 01:13:11,085
Babes.

802
01:13:12,453 --> 01:13:14,250
The one thing better than brawling.

803
01:13:21,329 --> 01:13:24,389
So, you play Xbox a lot?

804
01:13:28,269 --> 01:13:29,395
"Useless junk".

805
01:13:29,771 --> 01:13:31,705
You sure you don't need a bigger box?

806
01:13:38,246 --> 01:13:40,146
Tools of his trade.

807
01:13:43,785 --> 01:13:45,446
Those look kind of cute on you.

808
01:13:46,988 --> 01:13:48,421
They're still sweaty.

809
01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:51,449
- Sorry.
- No, I like it.

810
01:13:57,332 --> 01:13:58,321
Get up.

811
01:13:59,167 --> 01:14:00,657
I said, "Get up".

812
01:14:01,469 --> 01:14:02,629
Okay, I'm up.

813
01:14:06,107 --> 01:14:07,574
Nice contact.

814
01:14:07,675 --> 01:14:09,472
Two older brothers, one bathroom.

815
01:14:11,546 --> 01:14:12,638
Show me.

816
01:14:13,147 --> 01:14:14,171
Show you what?

817
01:14:14,782 --> 01:14:15,749
What you got.

818
01:14:17,352 --> 01:14:18,341
Show me.

819
01:14:19,821 --> 01:14:21,880
You got good stance.

820
01:14:22,857 --> 01:14:24,085
You love my stance.

821
01:14:25,994 --> 01:14:26,961
I do.

822
01:14:29,297 --> 01:14:30,992
Can you take it to the ground?

823
01:14:36,404 --> 01:14:38,065
You see, it's about submission.

824
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:41,006
You wanna be able to make
your opponent tap out.

825
01:14:41,476 --> 01:14:42,704
Tap out?

826
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:47,247
You wanna make it so painful
that they wanna give up.

827
01:14:53,087 --> 01:14:54,486
I don't tap out.

828
01:15:01,329 --> 01:15:02,694
You wanna tap out?

829
01:15:06,234 --> 01:15:11,638
Do you want to tap out?

830
01:15:25,153 --> 01:15:26,120
Okay.

831
01:15:27,488 --> 01:15:28,648
Hey, Charlie.

832
01:15:29,190 --> 01:15:30,589
What are you guys doing?

833
01:15:32,026 --> 01:15:32,993
Wrestling.

834
01:15:33,328 --> 01:15:34,295
Yeah.

835
01:15:34,862 --> 01:15:36,090
What's up?

836
01:15:36,531 --> 01:15:37,930
Phone. Mom.

837
01:15:39,233 --> 01:15:41,064
- Okay.
- Mom.

838
01:15:42,770 --> 01:15:44,328
Big wrestling fan.

839
01:15:53,781 --> 01:15:55,146
Okay, okay.
Who needs a margarita?

840
01:15:55,249 --> 01:15:56,216
Hi.

841
01:15:57,652 --> 01:15:58,619
Yo, Aaron.

842
01:15:59,253 --> 01:16:01,084
Fresh batch, baby. You want one?

843
01:16:01,422 --> 01:16:03,083
No, thanks, Mr. McCarthy. I'm good.

844
01:16:03,191 --> 01:16:05,125
Come on, man. Don't be a punk.
Have a drink with me.

845
01:16:05,727 --> 01:16:07,126
And don't call me Mr. McCarthy.

846
01:16:07,228 --> 01:16:08,559
- I'm not that old.
- Dad!

847
01:16:10,565 --> 01:16:11,725
I think we're good.

848
01:16:13,501 --> 01:16:15,833
All right.
If we're good, guess we're good, huh?

849
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:22,007
Are you getting smart with me here
in front of your friends?

850
01:16:23,344 --> 01:16:24,675
I asked you a question.

851
01:16:24,812 --> 01:16:27,610
Are you getting smart with me here
in front of your friends?

852
01:16:28,716 --> 01:16:31,742
You wanna be the best,
you gotta take out the best.

853
01:16:36,958 --> 01:16:39,654
All right, I can take a hint. It's all good.

854
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:43,959
- I'll see all you guys later, all right?
- So long, Mr. McCarthy.

855
01:16:47,468 --> 01:16:49,959
Shit. Can you believe Tyler bailed
on the Beatdown?

856
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:53,974
What? Why?

857
01:16:54,876 --> 01:16:57,003
He's scared of getting his ass kicked, man.

858
01:16:57,111 --> 01:16:59,170
That's not the word on the street, man.

859
01:16:59,814 --> 01:17:00,781
Oh, yeah?

860
01:17:02,383 --> 01:17:03,350
What is it?

861
01:17:03,618 --> 01:17:06,917
What is the word on the street?

862
01:17:07,021 --> 01:17:09,216
My bet is that he can kick your ass.

863
01:17:12,293 --> 01:17:13,260
What?

864
01:17:20,268 --> 01:17:21,235
What's up?

865
01:17:21,436 --> 01:17:22,664
Just hitting the mats.

866
01:17:23,371 --> 01:17:26,431
You're training with Roqua.
You must be getting pretty good.

867
01:17:26,541 --> 01:17:29,305
Mad Max, master of the ground and pound.

868
01:17:30,445 --> 01:17:31,412
Yeah, dude.

869
01:17:32,246 --> 01:17:33,213
Thanks.

870
01:17:34,916 --> 01:17:38,477
So, I heard your boy doesn't want
to roll at the Beatdown.

871
01:17:38,586 --> 01:17:40,611
That's correct. He's out.

872
01:17:41,022 --> 01:17:44,321
Would have been sick, right?
You and him made it to the finals.

873
01:17:44,425 --> 01:17:45,915
Guess we'll never know.

874
01:17:48,329 --> 01:17:49,296
Take it easy.

875
01:17:55,036 --> 01:17:58,267
Hey, you wanna come hang at the house?

876
01:17:58,806 --> 01:18:01,502
Show some of the guys
the new moves you're working on?

877
01:18:03,077 --> 01:18:04,271
Sure thing, man.

878
01:18:06,314 --> 01:18:08,839
Hey, no, come on. Ride with me.

879
01:18:16,290 --> 01:18:17,621
Max! Max!

880
01:18:27,635 --> 01:18:29,899
Come on, dude. Jump kick some more.

881
01:18:30,204 --> 01:18:31,171
Nice. Lower it.

882
01:18:31,372 --> 01:18:32,339
Let's go.

883
01:18:34,942 --> 01:18:36,273
- Check it out.
- Good.

884
01:18:38,012 --> 01:18:40,003
Hey, man, you gotta...

885
01:18:40,114 --> 01:18:41,741
You wanna kind of, like,
control the breathing.

886
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:44,241
Seriously, most fights end
because one fighter gets gassed.

887
01:18:44,485 --> 01:18:45,952
And then when that happens,
dude, forget about it.

888
01:18:46,053 --> 01:18:47,850
You know, we can do without
the insight, Sensei. Thanks.

889
01:18:47,955 --> 01:18:49,081
Sit down, Max.

890
01:18:49,190 --> 01:18:51,488
Don't laugh at him, you assholes.

891
01:18:52,827 --> 01:18:53,794
He's right.

892
01:18:54,962 --> 01:18:57,328
Most guys lose because they get winded.

893
01:18:57,865 --> 01:18:58,832
Right?

894
01:18:59,233 --> 01:19:00,200
- Right.
- Yeah.

895
01:19:01,002 --> 01:19:02,765
Come on. Me and you.

896
01:19:04,005 --> 01:19:06,064
Let's teach these boys a lesson, huh?

897
01:19:06,774 --> 01:19:07,741
Yeah.

898
01:19:07,842 --> 01:19:09,036
Come on.

899
01:19:12,013 --> 01:19:15,141
Guard up. Guard up. Guard up.

900
01:19:15,449 --> 01:19:21,479
You know, you can tell everything about
a fighter from how they take the first shot.

901
01:19:23,191 --> 01:19:24,158
Shit.

902
01:19:28,029 --> 01:19:31,931
When you get tagged,
your mind only registers two thoughts,

903
01:19:32,033 --> 01:19:34,160
back the hell up or get the hell in.

904
01:19:38,206 --> 01:19:39,571
Dude, I don't have any gear on.

905
01:19:39,674 --> 01:19:41,335
That's what it comes down to.

906
01:19:42,577 --> 01:19:44,943
You're either backing out
or you're getting in.

907
01:19:49,317 --> 01:19:51,308
Ryan, don't! Stop!

908
01:19:53,854 --> 01:19:54,821
Jesus, Ryan!

909
01:19:56,891 --> 01:19:59,758
You know, I don't think
I've seen this one on ESPN.

910
01:19:59,860 --> 01:20:01,191
You just wait.

911
01:20:01,295 --> 01:20:02,557
Indian Poker's gonna be huge.

912
01:20:02,663 --> 01:20:04,392
See, Hold 'Em's all about luck.

913
01:20:04,498 --> 01:20:06,796
This, thinking man's game.

914
01:20:08,135 --> 01:20:09,659
Raise you two blues.

915
01:20:11,038 --> 01:20:15,134
I got a strange feeling I should fold,
but I'm definitely gonna call you.

916
01:20:20,915 --> 01:20:23,110
How do you win every time?

917
01:20:23,484 --> 01:20:25,315
It is a thinking man's game.

918
01:20:28,522 --> 01:20:29,955
So, you wanna wrestle?

919
01:20:33,261 --> 01:20:34,694
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

920
01:20:34,795 --> 01:20:37,286
Hurry up. Go. Hurry up, man. Go.

921
01:20:44,905 --> 01:20:45,894
Jake?

922
01:20:51,112 --> 01:20:52,511
Max! Max!

923
01:20:54,081 --> 01:20:57,016
Oh, no! Call 911!

924
01:20:58,319 --> 01:20:59,877
It's gonna be okay, man.

925
01:21:11,399 --> 01:21:16,598
Fractured ribs, six stitches
inside his lip, and a broken nose.

926
01:21:18,472 --> 01:21:20,667
That must have been one hell of a fall.

927
01:21:22,109 --> 01:21:23,076
You're gonna be fine,

928
01:21:23,177 --> 01:21:25,407
but we'll have to keep you here
overnight for observation.

929
01:21:25,513 --> 01:21:27,640
- Called your parents?
- Yeah.

930
01:21:28,482 --> 01:21:29,540
Are they coming?

931
01:21:31,686 --> 01:21:33,677
- We have to call the police.
- No way.

932
01:21:34,155 --> 01:21:35,144
Why not?

933
01:21:38,659 --> 01:21:40,092
I need to borrow your car.

934
01:21:43,564 --> 01:21:44,758
Jake!

935
01:21:44,865 --> 01:21:46,799
Jake, wait!

936
01:21:46,901 --> 01:21:49,028
He's baiting you, just like at the party.

937
01:21:49,136 --> 01:21:51,502
- This is different.
- Really?

938
01:21:51,605 --> 01:21:52,594
'Cause from right here it looks like

939
01:21:52,707 --> 01:21:53,833
you're giving him exactly what he wants.

940
01:21:53,941 --> 01:21:57,240
Who's next? You? Charlie?

941
01:21:58,379 --> 01:22:01,780
Jake, walking away and giving up
are not the same thing.

942
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:04,714
Good, 'cause I'm not doing either one.

943
01:22:24,271 --> 01:22:25,465
Hey, Jake!

944
01:22:26,974 --> 01:22:27,941
Jake!

945
01:22:28,909 --> 01:22:29,876
Where's Max?

946
01:22:33,748 --> 01:22:35,045
He's in the hospital.

947
01:22:36,484 --> 01:22:37,451
That boy

948
01:22:38,586 --> 01:22:40,747
whose truck Max got into, he hurt Max.

949
01:22:45,092 --> 01:22:46,889
- Revenge...
- No.

950
01:22:47,595 --> 01:22:49,495
Revenge has nothing to do with this.

951
01:22:49,597 --> 01:22:51,997
Listen, whatever your reasons,
right or wrong,

952
01:22:52,099 --> 01:22:53,999
the consequences will be the same.

953
01:22:56,370 --> 01:22:57,598
That's fine by me.

954
01:22:58,539 --> 01:23:00,905
Do this and you can never come back
in my gym again.

955
01:23:01,008 --> 01:23:03,476
I let you get away with it once, not twice.

956
01:23:05,513 --> 01:23:06,480
Wait. Wait!

957
01:23:06,580 --> 01:23:08,172
What? You think this is what I want?

958
01:23:08,282 --> 01:23:10,375
To never train with you again just to

959
01:23:10,484 --> 01:23:13,009
give some asshole
the show that he's looking for?

960
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:14,883
Then stop. Let it go!

961
01:23:20,795 --> 01:23:23,093
The night my dad died,

962
01:23:23,197 --> 01:23:25,097
I just let him drive.

963
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:26,962
I didn't even try to stop him.

964
01:23:27,668 --> 01:23:29,966
Doing nothing has consequences, too.

965
01:23:30,070 --> 01:23:32,163
You cannot live in the past, my friend.

966
01:23:32,273 --> 01:23:33,262
Really?

967
01:23:33,974 --> 01:23:38,001
If you could go back
and stop the guy who shot your brother...

968
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:40,478
- Don't push me.
- I know you would have fought that guy.

969
01:23:41,248 --> 01:23:43,113
- I know that you would have...
- You know nothing.

970
01:23:43,217 --> 01:23:45,811
Seven years.

971
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:49,287
Seven years, I have not seen my family,

972
01:23:49,390 --> 01:23:50,721
my friends.

973
01:23:50,825 --> 01:23:53,316
And every day, like the day before,

974
01:23:53,427 --> 01:23:56,988
I wake up, wash my face,
look myself in the mirror,

975
01:24:01,035 --> 01:24:02,002
disgusted.

976
01:24:03,938 --> 01:24:05,667
Why not go back?

977
01:24:08,676 --> 01:24:10,007
And face my father?

978
01:24:12,446 --> 01:24:14,175
The last time he spoke to me

979
01:24:15,249 --> 01:24:18,412
he said both of his sons died that night.

980
01:24:25,426 --> 01:24:27,018
If that's what you believe,

981
01:24:29,196 --> 01:24:30,288
then he was right.

982
01:24:31,065 --> 01:24:32,089
You gave up.

983
01:24:33,767 --> 01:24:35,826
Sometimes fighting the fight

984
01:24:35,936 --> 01:24:39,633
means that you have to do the one thing

985
01:24:39,740 --> 01:24:41,401
that you don't want to do.

986
01:24:42,810 --> 01:24:45,074
You have to fight for his forgiveness.

987
01:24:46,013 --> 01:24:48,243
You can't just hide here forever.

988
01:24:49,083 --> 01:24:50,345
At least I can't.

989
01:24:51,785 --> 01:24:53,753
I'm gonna stop this guy.

990
01:24:55,222 --> 01:24:57,520
Win, lose, it makes no difference.

991
01:24:59,593 --> 01:25:00,855
It ends tonight.

992
01:25:03,130 --> 01:25:04,495
This is my fight.

993
01:25:06,033 --> 01:25:07,261
Everyone's got one.

994
01:25:13,173 --> 01:25:14,140
Jake.

995
01:25:16,677 --> 01:25:18,235
No matter what happens,

996
01:25:20,014 --> 01:25:21,709
control the outcome.

997
01:25:22,650 --> 01:25:23,844
It's on you.

998
01:25:24,151 --> 01:25:25,379
Always has been.

999
01:25:51,278 --> 01:25:52,404
Come in.

1000
01:25:54,014 --> 01:25:55,276
I was wondering...

1001
01:25:59,987 --> 01:26:01,921
I don't want to lie about this.

1002
01:26:06,327 --> 01:26:07,954
I'm not gonna ask you to.

1003
01:26:44,331 --> 01:26:45,298
Hold up.

1004
01:26:45,699 --> 01:26:47,132
No, no, no, he's cool.

1005
01:26:49,403 --> 01:26:50,597
You have fun, Jake.

1006
01:27:22,536 --> 01:27:24,333
<i>Everybody do what they gotta do.</i>

1007
01:27:25,305 --> 01:27:26,272
<i>Yeah.</i>

1008
01:27:27,074 --> 01:27:28,041
<i>That's right.</i>

1009
01:27:28,242 --> 01:27:30,870
<i>It's 12:00 right about now.
You know what time it is?</i>

1010
01:27:31,078 --> 01:27:32,670
Beatdown!

1011
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:38,184
<i>Lock the doors, nobody gets out alive.
It's time for the Beatdown!</i>

1012
01:27:38,285 --> 01:27:45,157
Beatdown! Beatdown! Beatdown!
Beatdown! Beatdown! Beatdown!

1013
01:27:47,795 --> 01:27:49,990
<i>The first match is about to begin.</i>

1014
01:27:50,097 --> 01:27:52,497
<i>Let's give it up for Camin and Mintz!</i>

1015
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:02,102
This is a no holds barred match.

1016
01:28:02,209 --> 01:28:06,077
No eye gouging,
no crotch shots and no biting.

1017
01:28:06,780 --> 01:28:09,613
Bout ends with a tap out or a knockout.

1018
01:28:10,818 --> 01:28:11,807
Fight!

1019
01:28:11,919 --> 01:28:13,079
Come on, Mintz!

1020
01:28:18,959 --> 01:28:20,517
<i>Check that right.</i>

1021
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:25,053
Do it, man!

1022
01:28:25,165 --> 01:28:26,496
<i>Camin and Mintz!</i>

1023
01:28:27,735 --> 01:28:29,327
It's gonna go down!

1024
01:28:31,605 --> 01:28:33,869
<i>Whoa! It's over.</i>

1025
01:28:36,143 --> 01:28:37,735
<i>Kick to the face.</i>

1026
01:28:38,212 --> 01:28:40,680
<i>Mintz is going on to the next round!</i>

1027
01:28:40,914 --> 01:28:42,939
<i>Yeah!</i>

1028
01:28:43,383 --> 01:28:45,408
<i>Show your stuff. Show your stuff.</i>

1029
01:28:47,654 --> 01:28:49,281
Jake Tyler, checking in.

1030
01:28:49,823 --> 01:28:51,256
<i>We're still in the first round.</i>

1031
01:28:51,358 --> 01:28:55,818
<i>And we have 32 fighters
going for the title of Beatdown King.</i>

1032
01:28:55,929 --> 01:28:59,763
<i>And right about now, we got the new guy,
Jake Tyler, trying to throw up</i>

1033
01:28:59,867 --> 01:29:04,998
<i>against current Beatdown King,
Ryan McCarthy!</i>

1034
01:29:15,082 --> 01:29:16,242
Oh, my God!

1035
01:29:18,552 --> 01:29:19,519
Wow!

1036
01:29:27,628 --> 01:29:29,323
Ryan is so hot!

1037
01:29:29,429 --> 01:29:31,693
<i>Check mine out, too, yeah.</i>

1038
01:29:32,432 --> 01:29:34,457
<i>Strictly for the ladies.</i>

1039
01:29:38,572 --> 01:29:40,506
<i>New guy, he's been doing some push-ups,</i>

1040
01:29:40,607 --> 01:29:42,404
<i>but he's still a dead man walking.</i>

1041
01:29:50,651 --> 01:29:53,185
<i>McCarthy and Tyler.</i>

1042
01:29:57,057 --> 01:29:58,319
<i>Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo!</i>

1043
01:29:58,425 --> 01:30:01,019
<i>Slight mix-up, man.
It's not McCarthy versus Tyler.</i>

1044
01:30:01,128 --> 01:30:02,823
<i>It's McCarthy versus Taylor.</i>

1045
01:30:02,930 --> 01:30:05,694
<i>I'm sorry, y'all.
It's McCarthy versus Taylor,</i>

1046
01:30:05,799 --> 01:30:07,926
<i>and not McCarthy versus Tyler.</i>

1047
01:30:08,035 --> 01:30:10,629
<i>We made a mistake. We misread. I'm sorry.</i>

1048
01:30:10,737 --> 01:30:13,433
<i>I can't read sometimes.
I can't read. Damn it!</i>

1049
01:30:13,540 --> 01:30:14,905
<i>Don't boo me. I'll beat your ass.</i>

1050
01:30:15,008 --> 01:30:16,669
You dodged a bullet there, huh?

1051
01:30:16,777 --> 01:30:18,677
Stick around. This'll be quick.

1052
01:30:29,823 --> 01:30:31,984
<i>Oh, knee to the head!</i>

1053
01:30:43,303 --> 01:30:44,429
<i>Beatdown King.</i>

1054
01:30:57,150 --> 01:30:58,117
<i>Leg lock!</i>

1055
01:31:04,758 --> 01:31:06,350
<i>Jake Tyler!</i>

1056
01:31:16,370 --> 01:31:17,337
<i>Yeah!</i>

1057
01:31:52,339 --> 01:31:53,601
<i>Reversal!</i>

1058
01:32:08,255 --> 01:32:10,348
<i>He tapped out! He tapped out!</i>

1059
01:32:14,361 --> 01:32:17,421
<i>Jake Tyler returns from the dead.</i>

1060
01:32:37,017 --> 01:32:38,211
Yeah!

1061
01:32:52,599 --> 01:32:54,965
<i>Only eight guys left, people!</i>

1062
01:32:55,068 --> 01:32:58,401
<i>And we got Jake Tyler versus Dak-Ho.</i>

1063
01:33:00,674 --> 01:33:02,835
Down! Let him bring it!

1064
01:33:05,112 --> 01:33:07,080
<i>Jake Tyler is hurt!</i>

1065
01:33:07,180 --> 01:33:08,704
<i>A kick to the ribs.</i>

1066
01:33:14,086 --> 01:33:16,247
<i>Many exchanges with these two.</i>

1067
01:33:16,355 --> 01:33:17,322
<i>Watch out!</i>

1068
01:33:18,390 --> 01:33:19,789
<i>Superman!</i>

1069
01:33:19,892 --> 01:33:21,018
<i>Punch to the face!</i>

1070
01:33:21,126 --> 01:33:22,320
<i>Dak-Ho!</i>

1071
01:33:23,662 --> 01:33:26,460
<i>- Come on!
- Dak-Ho is killing him out there!</i>

1072
01:33:27,766 --> 01:33:29,791
Bust that pretty face!

1073
01:33:36,308 --> 01:33:37,866
<i>Tyler slams Dak-Ho.</i>

1074
01:33:51,523 --> 01:33:53,616
<i>Leg lock! He's got the ankle.</i>

1075
01:33:54,226 --> 01:33:57,593
<i>I think it's a wrap for Jake Tyler.
It's over. It's over.</i>

1076
01:34:02,901 --> 01:34:04,528
<i>Reversal!</i>

1077
01:34:06,538 --> 01:34:10,133
<i>Jake Tyler, back from the dead.
How does he do it?</i>

1078
01:34:12,311 --> 01:34:13,403
<i>Triangle choke!</i>

1079
01:34:17,449 --> 01:34:19,349
<i>He tapped out!</i>

1080
01:34:19,785 --> 01:34:22,447
<i>It's over! It is over!</i>

1081
01:34:24,957 --> 01:34:27,289
<i>Jake Tyler is going on to the semi-finals.</i>

1082
01:34:27,392 --> 01:34:30,259
<i>I can't believe it! Dak-Ho is out of there!</i>

1083
01:34:30,929 --> 01:34:32,794
<i>Fight fans have got to love it.</i>

1084
01:34:35,233 --> 01:34:39,499
<i>Give it up for the new guy, Jake Tyler!</i>

1085
01:34:57,456 --> 01:34:58,650
Hey!

1086
01:34:59,758 --> 01:35:01,385
Are you sure you can fight?

1087
01:35:02,227 --> 01:35:03,854
Yeah. Just give me a minute.

1088
01:35:14,606 --> 01:35:16,335
I said just give me a minute.

1089
01:35:19,211 --> 01:35:21,679
So, I show up,
and that's the welcome I get?

1090
01:35:23,782 --> 01:35:25,272
You look like shit.

1091
01:35:27,519 --> 01:35:29,282
That's an insult to shit.

1092
01:35:30,689 --> 01:35:32,554
What are you doing here?

1093
01:35:34,393 --> 01:35:36,953
I guess I couldn't walk away either.

1094
01:35:38,930 --> 01:35:39,897
Why not?

1095
01:35:41,633 --> 01:35:44,033
I went back and sat with Max after you left,

1096
01:35:44,603 --> 01:35:46,935
wondering when...

1097
01:35:47,039 --> 01:35:50,770
If someone from his family
was going to show up.

1098
01:35:54,346 --> 01:35:56,405
Then I realized they already had.

1099
01:35:57,749 --> 01:35:58,875
I get it,

1100
01:36:00,152 --> 01:36:01,346
why you're fighting.

1101
01:36:07,793 --> 01:36:09,988
It's like the Shield of Achilles.

1102
01:36:11,063 --> 01:36:13,827
You're fighting so that
you don't have to fight again.

1103
01:36:17,869 --> 01:36:19,336
Shield of Achilles.

1104
01:36:22,274 --> 01:36:23,241
Nicely done.

1105
01:36:28,413 --> 01:36:29,880
You can do this.

1106
01:36:35,353 --> 01:36:37,253
<i>This is the semi-final round!</i>

1107
01:36:38,824 --> 01:36:40,553
<i>Looks cute, but it's not enough.</i>

1108
01:36:41,993 --> 01:36:43,961
<i>Body slammed on the floor!</i>

1109
01:36:46,898 --> 01:36:49,492
<i>Come on, champ. What are you doing?
Why can't you finish?</i>

1110
01:36:50,302 --> 01:36:53,362
<i>He ain't even fighting back.
Why you taking so long, champ?</i>

1111
01:36:53,572 --> 01:36:56,370
<i>This ain't the Ryan McCarthy
we've been seeing all night!</i>

1112
01:36:56,508 --> 01:36:58,066
<i>Give us a show, baby!</i>

1113
01:37:03,949 --> 01:37:06,281
<i>He taps out. Villa taps out!</i>

1114
01:37:06,384 --> 01:37:09,251
<i>Ryan McCarthy is the winner!</i>

1115
01:37:11,089 --> 01:37:12,420
<i>Give it up again!</i>

1116
01:37:12,624 --> 01:37:13,591
Yeah!

1117
01:37:13,692 --> 01:37:15,683
<i>Let him hear it, y'all. Let him hear it!</i>

1118
01:37:15,794 --> 01:37:16,920
We love you, Ryan!

1119
01:37:17,028 --> 01:37:18,222
<i>McCarthy is going on</i>

1120
01:37:18,330 --> 01:37:19,627
<i>- to the Championship Round!
- Wait. Hold up.</i>

1121
01:37:19,731 --> 01:37:20,857
Let me see.

1122
01:37:22,834 --> 01:37:25,860
McCarthy! Illegal move. DQ. Eye gouge.

1123
01:37:25,971 --> 01:37:27,302
<i>- Eye gouge?
- You're out.</i>

1124
01:37:27,405 --> 01:37:28,997
- Get over there.
- What? Keep it moving.

1125
01:37:29,107 --> 01:37:31,075
<i>- Hold on, y'all!
- You're out!</i>

1126
01:37:33,011 --> 01:37:34,911
<i>Ryan McCarthy eye gouges Villa!</i>

1127
01:37:35,013 --> 01:37:36,981
<i>He is disqualified.</i>

1128
01:37:50,562 --> 01:37:54,157
<i>This is Jake Tyler versus Tommy Kline.</i>

1129
01:38:02,107 --> 01:38:03,699
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

1130
01:38:06,678 --> 01:38:07,645
Are you ready?

1131
01:38:08,513 --> 01:38:09,480
Ready?

1132
01:38:12,284 --> 01:38:13,376
Fight, already!

1133
01:38:14,286 --> 01:38:16,220
- What happened to McCarthy?
- DQ.

1134
01:38:17,289 --> 01:38:18,256
Fight!

1135
01:38:23,662 --> 01:38:25,129
Did he just tap out?

1136
01:38:25,530 --> 01:38:26,895
You're not serious!

1137
01:38:26,998 --> 01:38:28,727
Come on, let's go.

1138
01:38:30,502 --> 01:38:34,461
<i>Jake Tyler taps out!
He didn't even throw a punch yet.</i>

1139
01:38:36,341 --> 01:38:39,174
<i>The winner by default is Tommy Kline.</i>

1140
01:38:39,277 --> 01:38:41,507
<i>So, what the hell is going on tonight, man?</i>

1141
01:38:43,014 --> 01:38:44,038
<i>All right, y'all.</i>

1142
01:38:44,149 --> 01:38:48,916
<i>I guess the championship match
is between Villa and Kline.</i>

1143
01:38:49,020 --> 01:38:50,851
<i>Sounds like a bad law firm.</i>

1144
01:38:50,956 --> 01:38:54,019
<i>I'm pissed off.
I'm going in the back to cool off.</i>

1145
01:38:54,125 --> 01:38:55,558
You sure you're okay?

1146
01:38:56,194 --> 01:38:57,161
Yeah.

1147
01:38:59,764 --> 01:39:01,163
What the hell was that?

1148
01:39:06,738 --> 01:39:10,230
This is about me and you.
I don't care about some tournament.

1149
01:39:13,178 --> 01:39:15,476
You giving up? Is that what you're doing?

1150
01:39:15,580 --> 01:39:18,981
No. I showed up. I'm here. I'm ready.

1151
01:39:23,188 --> 01:39:24,985
There's nobody here to watch now.

1152
01:39:25,924 --> 01:39:27,789
That's all you care about, right?

1153
01:39:28,026 --> 01:39:29,323
"Spectator sport"?

1154
01:39:32,530 --> 01:39:33,861
That's all you got.

1155
01:39:34,733 --> 01:39:35,927
Now you got nothing.

1156
01:39:37,235 --> 01:39:39,203
Walk away from it, man.

1157
01:39:46,945 --> 01:39:48,242
Ryan, stop!

1158
01:40:02,827 --> 01:40:03,794
It's on.

1159
01:40:04,362 --> 01:40:07,263
The real championship is going on outside.

1160
01:40:09,901 --> 01:40:11,562
<i>Where the hell y'all going?</i>

1161
01:40:11,970 --> 01:40:14,131
<i>Y'all can't leave the Beatdown like that.</i>

1162
01:40:14,572 --> 01:40:16,039
<i>Fight? Oh, shit!</i>

1163
01:40:26,818 --> 01:40:28,012
Light them up, man!

1164
01:40:30,055 --> 01:40:31,022
Watch his feet!

1165
01:40:31,122 --> 01:40:32,555
Kill him, Ryan!

1166
01:40:37,128 --> 01:40:39,153
Come on, Ryan. You past his door, baby.

1167
01:40:42,834 --> 01:40:44,426
Don't let him tie you up!

1168
01:40:46,304 --> 01:40:48,898
Come on, grapple with him.
Get on the ground with him.

1169
01:40:50,809 --> 01:40:52,902
Yeah, baby. Come on, Ryan, get up!

1170
01:40:53,044 --> 01:40:54,443
Come on, Ryan! Get up!

1171
01:40:55,880 --> 01:40:59,316
Come on, Ryan. You did it before.
Overhand right. Overhand right.

1172
01:41:05,323 --> 01:41:08,486
Jake, you're weak, man. You're weak, Jake.
You ain't got nothing!

1173
01:41:20,905 --> 01:41:22,896
This is the Beatdown right here!

1174
01:41:23,608 --> 01:41:24,870
You got moves!

1175
01:41:24,976 --> 01:41:26,568
Nice shield! Nice shield!

1176
01:41:29,114 --> 01:41:31,844
Go for the ribs, Ryan. He's hurt.
Go for the ribs.

1177
01:41:36,121 --> 01:41:37,520
Come on, Ryan! Get him!

1178
01:41:47,365 --> 01:41:49,265
Come on, Ryan! Get out of it!

1179
01:41:52,470 --> 01:41:53,437
Come on, Ryan!

1180
01:42:02,213 --> 01:42:05,273
Crack those ribs, baby.
Break them. Tenderize them!

1181
01:42:05,784 --> 01:42:06,751
Go, Ryan!

1182
01:42:06,918 --> 01:42:08,510
Ryan, stop it!

1183
01:42:14,125 --> 01:42:15,217
Jake! Come on!

1184
01:42:26,171 --> 01:42:27,570
Don't freak out, man!

1185
01:42:45,990 --> 01:42:46,957
Jake!

1186
01:42:52,297 --> 01:42:53,525
What the hell are you doing?

1187
01:42:53,631 --> 01:42:54,655
Ryan, you're an asshole!

1188
01:42:54,766 --> 01:42:56,666
Come on, Jake! Tap out, man!

1189
01:42:56,768 --> 01:42:57,735
Jake!

1190
01:42:57,869 --> 01:42:59,598
What are you doing? Ryan!

1191
01:42:59,904 --> 01:43:01,565
Ryan, let go!

1192
01:43:01,673 --> 01:43:04,403
You're gonna kill him, Ryan!
What the hell are you doing?

1193
01:43:05,543 --> 01:43:06,510
Jake!

1194
01:44:15,146 --> 01:44:16,443
Yeah!

1195
01:44:20,885 --> 01:44:21,852
Sorry.

1196
01:45:02,660 --> 01:45:04,423
You should not be driving a stick.

1197
01:45:04,529 --> 01:45:06,690
That's big talk from a guy
who takes the bus.

1198
01:45:39,797 --> 01:45:41,924
Hey, Max. You okay?

1199
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:46,531
Improving significantly.

1200
01:45:46,838 --> 01:45:47,989
Yeah!
