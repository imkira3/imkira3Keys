00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,430
NARRATOR: The Pokémon world!

2
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,390
An astounding place that almost defies description,

3
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:25,930
with its abundance and grandeur...!

4
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,800
NARRATOR: And, of course, Pokémon!

5
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,600
Flying high above the clouds,

6
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,600
swimming deep under the sea,

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,430
and roaming the rolling

8
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:34,970

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,760
they can be found everywhere you care to look!

10
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,720
NARRATOR: Here, we find a young man named Ash Ketchum, who hails

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,050
from Pallet Town, working with his partner Pikachu to catch

12
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,720
other Pokémon and refine his Pokémon battling skills!

13
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,600
NARRATOR: As he travels with his friends, there have been twists

14
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,930
and turns on the road during Ash's journey as a

15

Pokémon Trainer...

16
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,680
NARRATOR: Indeed, his road has branched off

17
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,720
in many directions...

18
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,510
NARRATOR: Lost at times, occasionally retracing his

19
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,970
steps, or forcing him to take the long way...but through it

20
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,180
all, continuing his journey just the same...!

21
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,720
NARRATOR: ...in order to realize his ideals,

22
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,180
as of yet unseen!

166
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,970
CILAN: They say it flew through the air from that valley and

167
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,720
landed right here on this spot!

168
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,180

PIKACHU: [QUESTIONING]

172
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,680

173
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,300
really the truth. But look! You can see with your very own eyes

174
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,970
that the berries in the surrounding orchards are

175

181
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,300

246
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,930
They say it's lived in this town since long ago!

247
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,010
ASH: WOW! I wanna meet it!

248
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,890
JUANITA: Very few have ever seen Victini...

249
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:46,970
ASH: Oh. Got ya...

250
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,010
CILAN: Can you tell us more about it?

251
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,300
JUANITA: It's said to give people and Pokémon power...

252
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,640
ASH: Power?

253
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,050
JUANITA: That's right! Long ago,

254
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,640
it was said to have protected the Sword of the Vale.

255

304
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,720
PIKACHU: [EXCITED]

305
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:36,300
It's always hard,

306
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:39,680
When the journey begins.

307
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:44,050
Hard to find your way;

308
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:47,010
Hard to make amends.

309
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,720
But there's nothing you can't do,

310
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,680
Cause you've got the power inside of you.

311
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,140
It's never easy,

312
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:02,930
To make a choice:

313
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:06,890
To keep things inside,

314
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:10,220
Or raise your voice.

315
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:14,100
But for everyone there comes a time

316
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,470
When the light inside begins to shine.

317
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:20,800
It's not always right or wrong,

318
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:24,340
As long as your spirit's strong.

319
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:27,100
It's not always win or lose,

320
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,100
It's the road you choose;

321
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:32,010
The answer's within.

322
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,430
It's not always black and white,

323
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:39,390
But your heart always knows what's right.

324
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:43,970
Let the journey begin-

325
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,510
So many choices;

326
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,220
How do we know?

327
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,100
So many places;

328
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,890
Where do we go?

329
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:07,640
What should I say?

330
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,600
What should I do?

331
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,640
Still, we're together: me and you!

332
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,260
It's not always right or wrong,

333
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,890
As long as your spirit's strong.

334
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:22,600
It's not always win or lose,

335
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,800
It's the road you choose;

336
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:27,680
The answer's within.

337
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,010
It's not always black and white,

338
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:35,050
but your heart always knows what's right.

339
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:39,140

341
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,180
There's nothing you can do,

342
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:55,510
'Cause you've got the power inside of you.

343
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,760
It's not always right or wrong,

344
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,550
As long as your spirit's strong.

345
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,260

00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:35,970
AXEW, PIKACHU, VICTINI: [PLAYFUL]

645
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:40,140
MANNES: You see, both Juanita and I are descendants of the

646
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,890
tribe called the People of the Vale.

647
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:44,010
ASH: People of the Vale...?

648
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:47,050
CILAN: It's the tribe mentioned in the castle's legend!

649
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,050
CARLITA: Correct!

650
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,680
JUANITA: We'll tell you a story...of Victini

651
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,800
and the People of the Vale.

652
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,970
MANNES: Here we go...

653
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:58,800
MANNES: Have a look! Over a thousand years ago, the People

654
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:02,510
of the Vale proudly lived under the rule of a mighty king!

655
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:04,510
ASH: It's Victini...!

656
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,100
IRIS: Was it the king's Pokémon?

657
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:10,390
MANNES: Yes, that's what the legend says...

658
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,760
JUANITA: The king ruled over what was called the

659
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,930
Kingdom of the Vale...

660
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:19,100
CILAN: Kingdom of the Vale...?

661
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,140
MANNES: The Kingdom drew its energy from the Dragon Force!

662
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,550
ASH: What's Dragon Force?

663
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:27,140
DAMON: It's the power that flows invisibly throughout our planet.

664
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:34,390
MANNES: By using that power wisely, people and Pokémon alike

665
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:37,640
were able to create an environment in perfect harmony

666
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,140
- at one with nature...

667
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:45,140
MANNES: The King had two sons: twin princes!

668
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:49,550
MANNES: And both princes were filled with wisdom and courage.

669
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,600
MANNES: Each prince possessed a unique quality

670
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,470
for which they were nicknamed.

671
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,180
MANNES: The Hero of Ideals!

672
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:59,970
MANNES: ...and the Hero of Truth!

673
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,010
MANNES: They were greatly loved...

674
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,050
IRIS: Are those...

675
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,050
CILAN: Pokémon...?

676
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,140
MANNES: Both princes were accompanied by

677
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:08,100
great dragon Pokémon!

678
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,840
CARLITA: Zekrom and Reshiram.

679
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:14,140
DAMON: Both of them granted great wisdom and strength only

680
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,180
to those judged worthy. BUT...

681
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,840
DAMON: ...the country lost its way, and the two princes

682
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:20,840
became enemies...

683
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,970
RESHIRAM: [ANGRY ROAR]

684
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,890
ZEKROM: [ANGRY ROAR]

685
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,800
MANNES: ...which eventually led to a great and

686
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:29,050
destructive war...

687
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:32,180
RESHIRAM: [FUSION FLARE MOVE]

688
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:37,300
ZEKROM: [FUSION BOLT MOVE]

689
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,680
JUANITA: The two fought ferociously,

690
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,680
finally wounding each other...

691
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,140
ZEKROM: [PAINED]

692
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,140
RESHIRAM: [PAINED]

693
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,220
MANNES: ...which used up all of their life energy.

694
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:56,390
MANNES: These great dragon Pokémon were transformed into

695
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:59,220
stone...and fell into a long, deep slumber.

696
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,510
JUANITA: By the time the two princes realized the mistake

697
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,760
they had made, it was too late.

698
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:16,720
JUANITA: The Dragon Force energy became chaotic!

699
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:19,390
MANNES: Witnessing the destruction of his

700
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:22,390
people's land, the king decided to use the power of Victini.

701
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,640
IRIS: Victini's...

702
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:24,970
CILAN: ...power! Wow...

703
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,720
VICTINI: [SURPRISED]

704
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:33,100
KING: Victini, please... grant me the use of your power!

705
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,680
VICTINI: [ACCEPTING]

706
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,970
JUANITA: In order to harness Victini's power,

707
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:42,510
the king created a barrier around the castle using the

708
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,800
Pillars of Protection...

709
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:51,430
VICTINI: [FOCUSED]

710
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,720
DUOSION GROUP, SIGILYPH GROUP: [FOCUSED]

711
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,640
MANNES: So, with all the townspeople gathered on

712
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,680
top of the castle...

713
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,260
MANNES: ...it lifted up into the sky!

714
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:24,050
MANNES: ...and the castle was carried to this mountaintop!

715
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,970
VICTINI: [ANXIOUS]

716
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:36,760
VICTINI: [WORRIED]

717
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:42,800
VICTINI: [RELIEVED]

718
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:50,800
VICTINI: [QUESTIONING]

719
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,840
JUANITA: However...the king's power was spent, and the Pillars

720
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:58,720
of Protection and the barrier remained.

721
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,180
MANNES: Eventually the chaos within the

722
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,300
Dragon Force subsided.

723
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:05,720
MANNES: The two princes were filled with deep remorse,

724
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,640
and they moved the stone dragon Pokémon

725
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,180
to a safe and secret location...

726
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:22,760
DAMON: But... the People of the Vale lost their bond with the

727
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,050
land and scattered everywhere!

728
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:27,300
DAMON: Even leaving behind Victini, who had

729
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:28,470
vanished from sight.

730
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,840
ASH: Victini's been here... for more than a thousand years?!

731
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,550
IRIS: A thousand years...?

732
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,470
CILAN: And trapped inside the barrier for all that time...!

733
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:41,550
PIKACHU, AXEW, VICTINI: [PLAYFUL]

734
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,220
ASH: Victini...

735
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,550
DAMON: Look over there!

736
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,220
DAMON: That's where the Kingdom once was...!

737
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:56,640
DAMON: My goal...is to bring the Kingdom of the

738
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,800
Vale back to life.

739
00:39:58,970 --> 00:39:59,890
CARLITA: Back to life?

740
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:01,260
VICTINI: [SURPRISED]

00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,340

ASH: Victini!

747
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:18,840
PIKACHU: [EXCITED]

748
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:24,930
DAMON: You said it would be nice...if the Kingdom of the

749
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:26,430
Vale could be restored...

750
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:29,050
JUANITA: I did...

751
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:34,390
JUANITA: The energy of this land no longer flows here...

752
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:37,890
JUANITA: ...so neither people nor Pokémon can live...

753
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:40,720
YOUNG DAMON: Wouldn't it be great if they could?

754
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,890
JUANITA: That's my dream, Damon.

755
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:56,220
DAMON: And now...I can finally fulfill that dream of yours!

756
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:03,720

MANNES: Three years ago...

788
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:42,050
MANNES: Damon returned and paid me a visit at my home.

789
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:48,260
DAMON: I want to contact the People of the Vale who have

790
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,890
scattered everywhere and have them return

791
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:51,470
so we can rebuild our Kingdom!

792
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:54,390
MANNES: But that's impossible!

793
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:58,840
DAMON: I have to try. Those who say "impossible"...

794
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:00,050
accomplish nothing!

795
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:06,970
DAMON: Since that time...

796
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:10,430
DAMON: I have journeyed far and wide in search of the

797
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:11,550
People of the Vale...

798
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,100
GLACINE: It's time for you to leave.

799

800
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:42,100
DAMON: Why, thank you...I'll return!

801
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,600
DAMON: At first, no one would even listen to me...

802
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,010
DAMON: Suddenly, I heard a voice...

803
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,180
RESHIRAM: There is no shortcut to the truth...
