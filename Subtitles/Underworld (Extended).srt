2
00:00:58,951 --> 00:01:03,080
The war had all but ground
to a halt in the blink of an eye.

3
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:09,256
Lucian, the most feared
and ruthless leader ever

4
00:01:09,257 --> 00:01:12,257
to rule the Lycan clan
had finally been killed.

5
00:01:14,842 --> 00:01:16,885
The Lycan horde
scattered to the wind

6
00:01:17,052 --> 00:01:20,389
in a single evening
of flame and retribution.

7
00:01:24,769 --> 00:01:27,689
Victory, it seemed,
was in our grasp,

8
00:01:27,856 --> 00:01:30,734
the very birthright
of the Vampires.

9
00:01:35,321 --> 00:01:37,991
Nearly six centuries had
passed since that night.

10
00:01:38,658 --> 00:01:43,413
Yet the ancient feud proved unwilling
to follow Lucian to the grave.

11
00:01:44,164 --> 00:01:46,499
Though Lycans were
fewer in number,

12
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:49,002
the war itself had become
more perilous

13
00:01:49,461 --> 00:01:52,547
for the moon no longer
held her sway.

14
00:01:53,298 --> 00:01:58,261
Older, more powerful Lycans
were now able to change at will.

15
00:01:58,887 --> 00:02:02,724
The weapons had evolved,
but our orders remained the same:

16
00:02:02,891 --> 00:02:06,686
Hunt them down and kill them off,
one by one.

17
00:02:07,854 --> 00:02:10,273
A most successful campaign.

18
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,861
Perhaps too successful.

19
00:02:24,413 --> 00:02:27,291
For those like me, a Death Dealer,

20
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:30,044
this signaled the end of an era.

21
00:02:30,711 --> 00:02:32,963
Like the weapons
of the previous century,

22
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,716
we too would become obsolete.

23
00:02:35,883 --> 00:02:39,261
Pity, because I lived for it.

24
00:04:02,973 --> 00:04:04,725
Hey!

25
00:04:24,536 --> 00:04:25,829
Bloods!

26
00:05:49,123 --> 00:05:52,167
It's all right. It's all right.
You're gonna be okay.

27
00:11:22,796 --> 00:11:26,010
You're acting like a pack
of rabid dogs!

28
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:30,306
And that, gentlemen,

29
00:11:30,473 --> 00:11:32,350
simply will not do.

30
00:11:32,516 --> 00:11:36,771
Not if you expect to defeat
the Vampires on their own ground.

31
00:11:37,646 --> 00:11:41,359
Not if you expect to survive at all.

32
00:11:42,151 --> 00:11:44,362
Pierce! Taylor!

33
00:11:46,364 --> 00:11:47,990
Put some clothes on, will you?

34
00:12:29,241 --> 00:12:30,742
We have a serious problem.

35
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:47,843
I'll have to run a few tests.

36
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:50,846
It's definitely an irradiated fluid
of some sort.

37
00:12:51,012 --> 00:12:52,681
Ultraviolet ammunition.

38
00:12:53,181 --> 00:12:54,975
Daylight, harnessed as a weapon.

39
00:12:55,392 --> 00:12:57,853
You expect me to believe
that a mangy animal

40
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:01,398
came up with a bullet specifically
engineered to kill Vampires?

41
00:13:01,565 --> 00:13:03,359
No, I'm betting it's military.

42
00:13:03,776 --> 00:13:06,821
Something they stole.
Some sort of high-tech tracer round.

43
00:13:06,988 --> 00:13:09,115
I don't care where
they got these things.

44
00:13:09,282 --> 00:13:12,201
Rigel is dead, and Nathaniel
could still be out there.

45
00:13:12,368 --> 00:13:14,579
We should gather the Death Dealers
and go back down there in force.

46
00:13:14,745 --> 00:13:17,707
Absolutely not. Not now.
Not for a random incursion.

47
00:13:17,874 --> 00:13:21,878
The Awakening is a few days off,
and this house is in unrest as it is.

48
00:13:22,044 --> 00:13:25,506
Random? They opened fire on us
in full view of the public.

49
00:13:25,673 --> 00:13:27,300
And from the commotion I heard
down in that tunnel-

50
00:13:27,467 --> 00:13:29,886
You said yourself
you actually didn't see anything.

51
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,222
Look, I know what I heard,
and I know what my gut tells me,

52
00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:36,642
and I am telling you there could be
dozens of Lycans down there.

53
00:13:36,809 --> 00:13:38,728
Who knows, maybe more.
Hundreds.

54
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,564
We've hunted them
to the brink of extinction.

55
00:13:43,316 --> 00:13:45,026
Kraven's right, Selene.

56
00:13:45,193 --> 00:13:48,070
There's not been a den
of that magnitude for centuries,

57
00:13:48,237 --> 00:13:49,280
not since the days of Lucian.

58
00:13:49,447 --> 00:13:51,115
I know that, Kahn.

59
00:13:51,282 --> 00:13:54,077
But I'd rather have you prove
me wrong by checking it out.

60
00:13:55,746 --> 00:13:57,581
Very well,
have your men tighten things up.

61
00:13:57,748 --> 00:13:59,917
I'll have Soren assemble
a search team.

62
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,835
No, I want to lead the team myself.

63
00:14:02,002 --> 00:14:05,464
Absolutely not!
Soren will handle it.

64
00:14:06,256 --> 00:14:08,467
Hundreds, really?

65
00:14:09,092 --> 00:14:10,469
Viktor would believe me.

66
00:14:15,557 --> 00:14:17,100
I'd never dream
of treating you like that.

67
00:14:17,267 --> 00:14:18,310
Of course you wouldn't.

68
00:14:18,727 --> 00:14:23,774
Now run along and make sure she's dressed
and ready for the arrival of her guests.

69
00:15:33,138 --> 00:15:34,598
It's a waste of time, you know.

70
00:15:34,764 --> 00:15:36,182
What is?

71
00:15:36,349 --> 00:15:38,685
Well, I seriously doubt Viktor would
want you freezing to death in here,

72
00:15:38,852 --> 00:15:40,478
staring at his tomb for hours on end.

73
00:15:40,645 --> 00:15:45,317
No, he'd want the Death Dealers out there
right now, scouring every inch of the city.

74
00:15:45,483 --> 00:15:49,863
Kraven. I'll never understand
why Viktor left him in charge.

75
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:52,449
He's a bureaucrat,
not a warrior.

76
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,993
Come on, we need to get you ready.

77
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,161
For what?

78
00:15:56,328 --> 00:15:57,454
The party.

79
00:15:57,621 --> 00:16:00,332
Amelia's envoy will be here
any minute.

80
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:00,017
Oh, yes.

81
00:17:00,184 --> 00:17:02,436
You should definitely wear this one.
It's perfect.

82
00:17:29,172 --> 00:17:30,882
They were after you.

83
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,142
He's attractive.

84
00:17:40,308 --> 00:17:41,309
For a human.

85
00:17:41,476 --> 00:17:42,728
Who's attractive?

86
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:59,077
You know I was planning to have you
at my side this evening.

87
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,663
Take Erika.
She's dying to be at your side.

88
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,046
If you ask me, you take this warrior
business far too seriously.

89
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:14,677
You can't undo the past,
no matter how many you kill.

90
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,096
And besides...

91
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,724
what's the point
in being immortal

92
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:22,393
if you deny yourself
the simple pleasures in life?

93
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,561
Do you see this human?

94
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,105
What of him?

95
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,024
I can't be positive,
but I'm beginning to think the Lycans-

96
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:30,193
Blast.

97
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,950
Put on something elegant
and be quick about it.

98
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,537
Kraven, I'm serious.
I think they were following him.

99
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,418
Other than food,
why would Lycans stalk a human?

100
00:20:01,036 --> 00:20:02,496
Any progress?

101
00:20:02,663 --> 00:20:05,165
Let's find out.

102
00:20:12,882 --> 00:20:14,967
Negative.

103
00:20:30,482 --> 00:20:32,152
You heading home?

104
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,031
Yeah, Nicholas gave me
a couple hours off.

105
00:20:36,406 --> 00:20:38,033
By the way...

106
00:20:38,199 --> 00:20:41,494
he said you did a terrific job
tonight with the surgery.

107
00:20:41,661 --> 00:20:43,121
Yeah.

108
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,834
Take it easy.

109
00:21:43,557 --> 00:21:45,434
We were ambushed.

110
00:21:45,726 --> 00:21:47,436
Death Dealers, three of them.

111
00:21:47,603 --> 00:21:49,146
And the candidate?

112
00:21:49,313 --> 00:21:51,273
We lost him.
You lost him.

113
00:21:53,526 --> 00:21:55,111
Look at this mess.

114
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:58,072
Ag rounds. High content.

115
00:21:58,239 --> 00:22:00,324
Prevented him from
making the change.

116
00:22:05,663 --> 00:22:09,208
No use in digging out the rest.
Silver's penetrated his organs.

117
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:11,962
Regeneration's impossible
at this point.

118
00:22:14,548 --> 00:22:16,633
Let's take these out.

119
00:22:20,971 --> 00:22:22,681
Relax.

120
00:22:27,978 --> 00:22:32,607
The Vampires didn't realize
you were following a human.

121
00:22:32,774 --> 00:22:33,775
Did they, Raze?

122
00:22:33,942 --> 00:22:35,444
No.

123
00:22:36,778 --> 00:22:37,863
I mean...

124
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,740
I don't think so.

125
00:22:39,906 --> 00:22:41,658
You don't think, or you don't know?

126
00:22:42,367 --> 00:22:43,660
I'm not sure.

127
00:23:01,219 --> 00:23:02,889
Negative.

128
00:23:04,557 --> 00:23:06,726
I really must have a look
at this Michael.

129
00:23:08,311 --> 00:23:10,480
Must I do everything myself?

130
00:23:21,741 --> 00:23:27,288
Our noble houses may be
separated by a great ocean,

131
00:23:27,455 --> 00:23:32,502
but we are equally committed
to the survival of the bloodlines.

132
00:23:32,668 --> 00:23:35,671
And when Amelia arrives
to awaken Marcus

133
00:23:35,838 --> 00:23:38,925
in just two days' time,

134
00:23:39,342 --> 00:23:43,012
we shall once again
be united as a single coven!

135
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:52,315
We want to thank our hosts
for their generous hospitality.

136
00:24:54,211 --> 00:24:57,882
He comes in, he does his job,
and then he goes home.

137
00:24:58,048 --> 00:25:00,718
Other than that,
I really don't know what to tell you.

138
00:25:00,885 --> 00:25:02,678
Interns pretty much work
around the clock.

139
00:25:02,845 --> 00:25:04,013
We don't have much of a life.

140
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,473
You know where we can find him?

141
00:25:06,724 --> 00:25:07,725
No. Um...

142
00:25:07,892 --> 00:25:12,730
You can try him at home,
or you'll have to wait till he gets back.

143
00:25:14,982 --> 00:25:17,234
He's not in some kind of trouble,
is he?

144
00:26:02,656 --> 00:26:05,367
This is Michael. I'm not in right now.
Please leave a message.

145
00:26:06,785 --> 00:26:10,372
Michael, it's Adam. The police were
just in the hospital looking for you.

146
00:26:10,538 --> 00:26:13,416
They were convinced you were
involved with a shootout.

147
00:26:13,792 --> 00:26:16,753
I told them there's no way you'd be
involved with something like that,

148
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,089
but they're looking for you.
Right now.

149
00:26:23,261 --> 00:26:25,012
Why are they after you?

150
00:26:49,412 --> 00:26:50,913
Shit!

151
00:27:37,419 --> 00:27:38,795
Hello, Michael.

152
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:08,012
What the fuck is going on?

153
00:30:52,953 --> 00:30:54,788
Stop the car.

154
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,624
Stop the car!

155
00:30:58,291 --> 00:30:59,793
Back off!

156
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,461
Okay.

157
00:31:02,337 --> 00:31:03,755
Okay.

158
00:31:05,298 --> 00:31:06,633
All right.

159
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:12,138
But you've lost a lot of blood.

160
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:15,183
If you don't stop the car,
you're gonna get us both killed.

161
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,311
I'm not screwing around!

162
00:31:18,478 --> 00:31:20,146
Neither am I.

163
00:31:20,313 --> 00:31:22,066
Now shut up and hold on.
I'll be fine.

164
00:31:27,863 --> 00:31:28,948
Shit!

165
00:33:10,427 --> 00:33:13,389
A second escape. Impressive.

166
00:33:13,555 --> 00:33:15,599
Perhaps Raze wasn't
overstating matters.

167
00:33:15,766 --> 00:33:18,435
Raze didn't bring back this.

168
00:33:30,406 --> 00:33:34,118
If Michael is indeed The Carrier,
the Vampires could-

169
00:33:34,284 --> 00:33:36,912
Relax, old friend.

170
00:33:37,121 --> 00:33:38,789
I've tasted his flesh.

171
00:33:39,707 --> 00:33:41,875
Just two days till full moon.

172
00:33:43,085 --> 00:33:45,671
Soon, he will be a Lycan.

173
00:33:46,255 --> 00:33:49,383
Soon, he will come looking for us.

174
00:34:09,988 --> 00:34:13,158
It's a shame we don't have more.

175
00:34:27,464 --> 00:34:29,674
Positive.

176
00:35:15,554 --> 00:35:18,766
Lay still. Your skull's
taken a good knock.

177
00:35:19,558 --> 00:35:21,936
You've been unconscious
for a while.

178
00:35:22,603 --> 00:35:26,398
Do you have any idea
why those men were after you?

179
00:35:26,732 --> 00:35:28,484
Where am I?

180
00:35:29,401 --> 00:35:31,154
You're safe.

181
00:35:35,075 --> 00:35:36,952
I'm Selene.

182
00:35:49,339 --> 00:35:52,384
So for once,
the rumors were true.

183
00:35:55,220 --> 00:36:00,016
The whole house has been absolutely
buzzing about your new pet.

184
00:36:02,185 --> 00:36:03,687
You're going to try to turn him,
aren't you?

185
00:36:03,854 --> 00:36:06,982
Of course not.

186
00:36:07,482 --> 00:36:10,193
So why did you bring him here?

187
00:36:12,362 --> 00:36:13,738
He saved my life.

188
00:36:16,992 --> 00:36:17,993
Why are you here?

189
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:19,160
Kraven sent me.

190
00:36:19,327 --> 00:36:22,082
He wants to see you. Now.

191
00:36:24,877 --> 00:36:27,254
This is completely unacceptable!

192
00:36:28,964 --> 00:36:32,593
You go against my orders and spend
the night away from the mansion

193
00:36:32,759 --> 00:36:36,179
with a human? A human you've
since brought back to my house.

194
00:36:36,346 --> 00:36:40,559
As far as I'm concerned,
this is still Viktor's house.

195
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,979
Look, I don't want to argue.

196
00:36:44,146 --> 00:36:47,274
I just you to understand that Michael is
somehow important to the Lycans-

197
00:36:47,441 --> 00:36:48,442
Oh, so now it's "Michael"!

198
00:36:48,609 --> 00:36:50,527
Kraven, would you just hear me out?

199
00:36:50,694 --> 00:36:54,323
It's just beyond me why you're so
obsessed over this ridiculous theory.

200
00:36:54,489 --> 00:36:56,992
Lucian wouldn't be
the slightest bit interested in a human,

201
00:36:57,159 --> 00:36:59,745
Michael or otherwise.

202
00:37:01,788 --> 00:37:04,082
Wait a minute.

203
00:37:05,667 --> 00:37:07,836
You're infatuated with him,
aren't you?

204
00:37:08,003 --> 00:37:10,172
Now, that's a ridiculous theory.

205
00:37:10,798 --> 00:37:12,133
Is it?

206
00:38:36,301 --> 00:38:38,595
Leave us!

207
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:15,175
I sure hope you never get
pissed off with me.

208
00:39:15,341 --> 00:39:16,968
Hold on.

209
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,930
Check this out.

210
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:28,396
Go ahead. Squeeze off a few.

211
00:39:40,951 --> 00:39:43,079
Eject the mag.

212
00:39:46,332 --> 00:39:50,086
You've copied the Lycan rounds.
Silver nitrate.

213
00:39:50,252 --> 00:39:51,921
A lethal dose.

214
00:39:52,088 --> 00:39:54,590
They won't dig these out,
like they do with our usual rounds.

215
00:39:54,757 --> 00:39:58,177
Straight into the bloodstream.
Ain't nothing to dig out.

216
00:40:02,473 --> 00:40:03,474
Tell me, Kahn.

217
00:40:04,683 --> 00:40:07,353
Do you believe Lucian died
the way they say he did?

218
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,188
Kraven been telling
war stories again, is he?

219
00:40:09,355 --> 00:40:10,773
That's my point.

220
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:14,151
It's nothing but an ancient story.
His story.

221
00:40:14,318 --> 00:40:17,530
There's not a shred of proof
he killed Lucian, only his word.

222
00:40:17,696 --> 00:40:20,699
I've never underestimated
Kraven's lust for advancement,

223
00:40:20,866 --> 00:40:23,744
but Viktor believed him,
and that's all that matters.

224
00:40:23,911 --> 00:40:25,579
Now, where you going
with this anyway?

225
00:40:25,746 --> 00:40:26,747
Nowhere.

226
00:40:48,521 --> 00:40:51,899
Engaging Death Dealers in public
and chasing after some human

227
00:40:52,066 --> 00:40:53,484
was not what I had in mind.

228
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:56,320
You were told to set up shop
and lay low!

229
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:59,574
Calm yourself, Kraven!

230
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:05,246
The human doesn't concern you.

231
00:41:06,122 --> 00:41:11,294
And besides, I've laid low
for quite long enough.

232
00:41:21,972 --> 00:41:24,433
Just keep your men at bay, Lucian.

233
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,435
At least for the time being.

234
00:41:26,602 --> 00:41:30,856
Don't force me to regret
our arrangement.

235
00:41:31,023 --> 00:41:33,609
You just concentrate on your part.

236
00:41:33,942 --> 00:41:38,113
Remember, I've bled for you
once already.

237
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,949
Without me, you'd have nothing.

238
00:41:41,116 --> 00:41:44,453
You'd be nothing.

239
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:33,397
Of the scores of brave souls
who entered Lucian's fortress

240
00:43:33,564 --> 00:43:37,484
a single Vampire survived:
Kraven,

241
00:43:37,651 --> 00:43:41,447
who was richly rewarded
for not only setting the great blaze,

242
00:43:41,613 --> 00:43:45,576
but for returning with evidence
of the Lycan master's demise,

243
00:43:45,743 --> 00:43:49,747
the branded skin,
cut from Lucian's very arm.

244
00:44:18,026 --> 00:44:19,027
I've been looking for you everywhere.

245
00:44:19,194 --> 00:44:21,112
Not now.
He's been bitten.

246
00:44:22,906 --> 00:44:25,325
Your human,
he's been marked by a Lycan.

247
00:44:27,994 --> 00:44:29,871
Did Kraven put you up to this?
No.

248
00:44:30,038 --> 00:44:33,583
I saw the wound with my own eyes,
I swear it.

249
00:44:35,668 --> 00:44:37,796
But what about the Covenant?

250
00:44:37,962 --> 00:44:40,175
You know it's forbidden!

251
00:44:47,808 --> 00:44:50,644
And ever since he bit me,
I've been-

252
00:44:51,812 --> 00:44:56,191
I've been having these hallucinations
and... And these delusions.

253
00:44:58,276 --> 00:45:02,656
All I know is, it feels like
my skull is splitting in half.

254
00:45:02,823 --> 00:45:05,409
Okay, so a full-grown man bit you?

255
00:45:08,078 --> 00:45:10,080
Jesus.

256
00:45:10,247 --> 00:45:11,998
Are you sure this wasn't a dog?

257
00:45:12,165 --> 00:45:14,584
I said, it was a man.
It was a man. Okay. Okay.

258
00:45:14,751 --> 00:45:15,877
Okay, I got it.

259
00:45:16,044 --> 00:45:18,088
He was after me.

260
00:45:18,255 --> 00:45:21,842
And that woman from the subway-
What woman?

261
00:45:22,717 --> 00:45:26,054
Haven't you been listening to me?
She took me hostage!

262
00:45:26,221 --> 00:45:29,266
All right. Just- Please.

263
00:45:30,518 --> 00:45:34,313
I'll help you get this all sorted out,
all right? I'll be right back.

264
00:45:36,399 --> 00:45:38,359
Let go, Michael.

265
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:40,445
Let go.

266
00:45:41,028 --> 00:45:45,199
Just calm down, okay?
I'm gonna be back in a minute.

267
00:45:45,366 --> 00:45:48,327
That's a promise. All right?
All right.

268
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:23,906
Hey!

269
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:27,034
Hey!

270
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:59,066
Please forgive me...

271
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:02,194
but I desperately need
your guidance.

272
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:10,203
Kahn wants to see you.

273
00:48:49,972 --> 00:48:51,223
To my knowledge,

274
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:55,853
an Awakening has never been
attempted by one such as myself.

275
00:48:56,437 --> 00:49:00,024
The elders hold the power to organize
their memories and thoughts

276
00:49:00,191 --> 00:49:02,318
into a single, cohesive vision,

277
00:49:02,485 --> 00:49:05,404
a detailed record of their reign.

278
00:49:05,571 --> 00:49:09,492
I can only hope Viktor
will hear my plea.

279
00:50:18,562 --> 00:50:22,149
Please forgive me,
but I desperately need your guidance.

280
00:50:23,483 --> 00:50:26,611
I apologize for breaking the chain and
awakening you ahead of schedule,

281
00:50:26,778 --> 00:50:29,323
but I fear we may all be
in grave danger.

282
00:50:30,324 --> 00:50:34,036
Especially you, my lord,
if left in your weakened state.

283
00:50:34,954 --> 00:50:37,665
For I believe that Lucian
is alive and well.

284
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:41,961
Here. Now. In this very city,

285
00:50:42,128 --> 00:50:45,381
preparing to hit us
during the Awakening ceremony.

286
00:50:46,716 --> 00:50:48,843
Even more disturbing...

287
00:50:49,969 --> 00:50:51,846
is that if I'm correct...

288
00:50:53,139 --> 00:50:55,808
it would mean that Kraven
is in league with him.

289
00:52:18,393 --> 00:52:20,436
What's so pressing?

290
00:52:20,937 --> 00:52:22,814
Take a look.

291
00:52:41,916 --> 00:52:43,626
Selene!

292
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:45,795
I want to speak with Selene!

293
00:52:49,632 --> 00:52:51,342
Is that Michael?

294
00:52:51,509 --> 00:52:52,760
Is it Michael?

295
00:52:52,927 --> 00:52:54,429
What the hell is going on?

296
00:52:54,596 --> 00:52:55,889
What's happening to me?

297
00:52:57,974 --> 00:52:59,019
I'm coming out.

298
00:53:00,979 --> 00:53:04,608
If you go to him, you'll never
be welcome in this house again.

299
00:53:07,611 --> 00:53:10,989
Now that Viktor's awake, we'll see
what he has to say about that.

300
00:53:24,502 --> 00:53:25,503
Get in.

301
00:53:51,489 --> 00:53:54,533
Look, I warned her. I warned
her, but she didn't listen.

302
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:56,369
She never listens.
I should've told you sooner.

303
00:53:56,535 --> 00:53:57,995
Told me what?

304
00:54:00,498 --> 00:54:02,875
Her human, Michael...

305
00:54:04,043 --> 00:54:06,545
he's not a human at all.

306
00:54:06,712 --> 00:54:07,880
He's a Lycan.

307
00:54:11,384 --> 00:54:12,802
What?!

308
00:54:12,969 --> 00:54:16,639
What's this ruckus?

309
00:54:20,643 --> 00:54:23,229
You can never come here again.
They'll kill you. Do you understand?

310
00:54:23,396 --> 00:54:26,399
Why? Who are you people?

311
00:55:10,694 --> 00:55:11,737
Leave us.

312
00:55:20,412 --> 00:55:22,539
Whether you like it or not,
you're in the middle of a war

313
00:55:22,706 --> 00:55:25,042
that's been raging
for the better part of 1000 years.

314
00:55:25,208 --> 00:55:28,295
A blood feud between
Vampires and Lycans.

315
00:55:30,006 --> 00:55:31,132
Werewolves.

316
00:55:44,270 --> 00:55:45,521
Consider yourself lucky.

317
00:55:45,688 --> 00:55:48,941
Most humans die within an hour
of being bitten by an immortal.

318
00:55:49,108 --> 00:55:50,985
The viruses we transmit
are deadly.

319
00:55:51,152 --> 00:55:54,405
And if you bit me, what,
I'd become a Vampire instead?

320
00:55:54,572 --> 00:55:55,907
No, you'd die.

321
00:55:56,741 --> 00:56:00,119
No one's ever survived
a bite from both species.

322
00:56:00,286 --> 00:56:02,830
By rights, I'd stop the car
and kill you myself-

323
00:56:02,997 --> 00:56:04,123
Then why are you helping me?

324
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:07,502
I'm not!
I track down and kill your kind.

325
00:56:07,668 --> 00:56:11,339
My only interest is finding out
why Lucian wants you so badly.

326
00:56:14,675 --> 00:56:17,678
Do you know why I've
been awakened, servant?

327
00:56:17,845 --> 00:56:19,681
No, my lord.

328
00:56:19,848 --> 00:56:21,016
But I'll soon find out.

329
00:56:21,183 --> 00:56:23,310
You mean when you find her.

330
00:56:23,602 --> 00:56:24,978
Yes, my lord.

331
00:56:25,145 --> 00:56:27,189
You must let her come to me.

332
00:56:28,357 --> 00:56:32,861
We have much to discuss,
Selene and I.

333
00:56:33,612 --> 00:56:39,076
She has shown me
a great many disturbing things.

334
00:56:39,243 --> 00:56:42,538
Things that will be dealt with
soon enough.

335
00:56:42,704 --> 00:56:46,667
This coven has grown weak,
decadent.

336
00:56:46,834 --> 00:56:51,296
Perhaps I should have left someone
else in charge of my affairs.

337
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,679
Still...

338
00:56:59,471 --> 00:57:01,807
her memories...

339
00:57:02,182 --> 00:57:04,726
are chaotic.

340
00:57:06,145 --> 00:57:07,896
There's no sense of time.

341
00:57:08,063 --> 00:57:10,401
Please, my lord,
let me summon assistance.

342
00:57:10,568 --> 00:57:12,236
You're in need of rest.

343
00:57:12,736 --> 00:57:15,906
I've rested enough.

344
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:19,869
What you will do
is summon Marcus.

345
00:57:23,289 --> 00:57:26,750
But he still slumbers, my lord.

346
00:57:28,127 --> 00:57:31,922
Amelia and the Council members
are arriving tomorrow night

347
00:57:32,089 --> 00:57:34,091
to awaken Marcus.

348
00:57:34,758 --> 00:57:36,760
Not you, my lord.

349
00:57:36,927 --> 00:57:41,098
You've been awakened
a full century ahead of schedule.

350
00:57:49,607 --> 00:57:51,817
That bitch has betrayed me.

351
00:57:52,610 --> 00:57:56,363
Now he knows everything
she's been obsessing about.

352
00:58:00,452 --> 00:58:02,204
Wait.

353
00:58:07,125 --> 00:58:08,960
Are you to be trusted?

354
00:58:09,961 --> 00:58:11,880
Of course.

355
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:14,382
Meet me in my quarters
in 20 minutes.

356
00:58:14,549 --> 00:58:17,552
It's time I filled you in
on a few things.

357
00:58:57,593 --> 00:59:01,555
I'm seeing these
things, these hallucinations.

358
00:59:01,722 --> 00:59:04,392
They're not hallucinations,
they're memories.

359
00:59:04,558 --> 00:59:08,354
You've been bitten. His memories
have been passed to you.

360
00:59:11,357 --> 00:59:16,696
This is one of the places we use
for interrogations. It should be safe.

361
00:59:31,877 --> 00:59:33,421
Ziodex Industries.

362
00:59:33,587 --> 00:59:34,755
We own it.

363
00:59:34,922 --> 00:59:37,717
First there was synthetic plasma,
now this.

364
00:59:37,883 --> 00:59:40,721
Once it's approved,
it should be our newest cash crop.

365
00:59:40,887 --> 00:59:42,764
It's cloned blood.

366
00:59:48,645 --> 00:59:49,813
What are these for?

367
00:59:51,898 --> 00:59:53,942
Lycans are allergic to silver.

368
00:59:54,109 --> 00:59:57,738
If we don't get our bullets out quickly,
they die during questioning.

369
00:59:58,572 --> 01:00:00,240
What do you do with them after?

370
01:00:01,742 --> 01:00:03,660
We put the bullets back in.

371
01:00:19,343 --> 01:00:20,761
How are things progressing?

372
01:00:20,927 --> 01:00:22,262
We're ready.

373
01:00:28,436 --> 01:00:30,938
Why do you hate them so much?

374
01:00:31,522 --> 01:00:34,233
I've already told you,
we're at war.

375
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,110
So you're just following orders?

376
01:00:44,786 --> 01:00:47,955
Why can't you just answer
the question?

377
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:52,043
Fine.

378
01:00:53,378 --> 01:00:55,797
Something was in the stable...

379
01:00:56,005 --> 01:00:58,966
tearing our horses to pieces.

380
01:01:00,343 --> 01:01:02,887
I couldn't have saved my mother.

381
01:01:03,054 --> 01:01:05,473
Or my sister.

382
01:01:05,848 --> 01:01:08,518
Their screams woke me.

383
01:01:09,102 --> 01:01:13,314
My father died outside,
trying to fend them off.

384
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:16,484
I stood at my door...

385
01:01:17,068 --> 01:01:20,323
about to run
to my nieces' room when.

386
01:01:26,579 --> 01:01:28,873
Twin girls.

387
01:01:31,501 --> 01:01:34,045
Barely 6 years old.

388
01:01:35,338 --> 01:01:37,590
Butchered like animals.

389
01:01:38,842 --> 01:01:40,176
Jesus Christ.

390
01:01:40,343 --> 01:01:43,346
The next thing I knew,
I was in his arms.

391
01:01:43,805 --> 01:01:46,808
The war had spilled into our house.

392
01:01:46,975 --> 01:01:49,894
He'd been tracking
the Lycans for days.

393
01:01:50,061 --> 01:01:52,313
He drove them off and saved me.

394
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:53,690
Who?

395
01:01:53,857 --> 01:01:55,150
Viktor.

396
01:01:56,359 --> 01:01:59,320
The oldest and strongest of us.

397
01:01:59,779 --> 01:02:02,866
That night,
he made me a Vampire.

398
01:02:03,366 --> 01:02:06,369
He gave me the strength
to avenge my family.

399
01:02:06,536 --> 01:02:09,373
Since then,
I've never looked back.

400
01:02:15,713 --> 01:02:18,132
I saw your pictures.

401
01:02:18,883 --> 01:02:21,051
Who is the woman, your wife?

402
01:02:29,643 --> 01:02:34,398
It may be wise to keep a
closer eye on our cousins.

403
01:02:34,899 --> 01:02:38,319
I'll have Raze
see to it immediately.

404
01:02:38,486 --> 01:02:42,907
I'm afraid that I'm going to have
to place my faith in you, my friend.

405
01:02:43,324 --> 01:02:46,744
Time is running short.

406
01:02:46,911 --> 01:02:50,331
I tried to swerve,
but he hit us anyway.

407
01:02:52,583 --> 01:02:55,252
He sent us right into
the oncoming lane.

408
01:02:59,090 --> 01:03:01,259
When I came to, I...

409
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:06,181
I realized that part of the engine
was in the front seat.

410
01:03:07,015 --> 01:03:12,854
And she was pinned there,
6 inches from me...

411
01:03:14,689 --> 01:03:17,442
in this horrible position.

412
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:23,823
I think she was in shock
because she just

413
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:27,369
kept asking me over
and over again if I was all right.

414
01:03:29,955 --> 01:03:31,748
She was more worried about me.

415
01:03:35,877 --> 01:03:39,881
You know, if I knew then what
I know now, I could have saved her.

416
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:44,261
There's no doubt in my mind
about that.

417
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:48,140
But instead she died right there...

418
01:03:49,392 --> 01:03:52,562
about two minutes before
the ambulance arrived.

419
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:01,070
After that, I didn't see
any reason to stick around.

420
01:04:01,237 --> 01:04:06,242
I spent a summer here with
my grandfather when I was a kid so...

421
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:09,245
After I got my degree, I just-

422
01:04:09,996 --> 01:04:11,747
I took off.

423
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:19,422
I came over here to move on,
to forget.

424
01:04:22,174 --> 01:04:25,011
It seemed like a good idea
at the time.

425
01:04:27,346 --> 01:04:29,348
And have you?

426
01:04:30,933 --> 01:04:32,184
Moved on?

427
01:04:33,936 --> 01:04:35,688
Have you?

428
01:04:44,948 --> 01:04:49,202
I need you to keep what I'm about to
tell you under the strictest confidence.

429
01:04:49,369 --> 01:04:51,371
It can wait.

430
01:05:17,397 --> 01:05:18,899
Who started the war?

431
01:05:19,274 --> 01:05:20,734
They did.

432
01:05:20,901 --> 01:05:24,529
Or at least that's what
we've been led to believe.

433
01:05:24,863 --> 01:05:27,910
Digging into the past is forbidden.

434
01:05:29,745 --> 01:05:31,747
I should be heading back.

435
01:05:31,914 --> 01:05:33,916
What about me?

436
01:05:34,083 --> 01:05:36,460
Viktor will know what to do.
I'll come back tomorrow night.

437
01:05:36,627 --> 01:05:37,795
I'm not staying here alone.

438
01:05:37,961 --> 01:05:39,296
You will if you want to live.

439
01:05:39,463 --> 01:05:40,673
No, I want to go with you.

440
01:05:59,149 --> 01:06:01,110
What are you doing?

441
01:06:04,405 --> 01:06:06,323
When the full moon
rises tomorrow night,

442
01:06:06,490 --> 01:06:10,369
you will change, you will kill,
and you will feed.

443
01:06:10,536 --> 01:06:12,454
It's unavoidable.

444
01:06:12,621 --> 01:06:15,666
I can't leave you free
to roam around. I'm sorry.

445
01:06:21,965 --> 01:06:25,260
A single round won't kill you, but
the silver prevents transformation.

446
01:06:25,427 --> 01:06:27,470
At least for a few hours.

447
01:06:27,637 --> 01:06:30,765
If I don't return in time,
do yourself a favor.

448
01:06:31,224 --> 01:06:33,226
Use it.

449
01:07:54,809 --> 01:07:56,060
Yeah?

450
01:07:56,227 --> 01:07:59,940
My lord. She's here.

451
01:08:14,287 --> 01:08:18,124
How could you do this to me?
Embarrass me like this?

452
01:08:18,291 --> 01:08:21,086
The entire coven knows
that I had plans for us.

453
01:08:21,253 --> 01:08:23,129
There is no us!

454
01:08:23,296 --> 01:08:25,173
You'll go before Viktor...

455
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:30,971
and tell him exactly what I tell you to!
From here on out, you'll do as I say.

456
01:08:31,137 --> 01:08:33,557
Is that in any way unclear?

457
01:09:19,854 --> 01:09:22,690
Come closer, my child.

458
01:09:24,734 --> 01:09:26,360
Outside.

459
01:09:26,903 --> 01:09:28,905
Come on, move it.

460
01:09:38,416 --> 01:09:41,002
I've been lost without you, my lord.

461
01:09:41,169 --> 01:09:45,006
Constantly hounded by Kraven
and his never-ending infatuation.

462
01:09:47,634 --> 01:09:51,304
It is the oldest story in the book.

463
01:09:51,471 --> 01:09:56,476
He desires the one thing
he cannot have.

464
01:09:58,394 --> 01:10:01,606
Now, tell me...

465
01:10:02,357 --> 01:10:05,860
why have you come to believe
that Lucian still lives?

466
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:08,571
Yeah.

467
01:10:08,738 --> 01:10:10,698
But I've given you
all the proof you need.

468
01:10:10,865 --> 01:10:15,954
Incoherent thoughts and images,
nothing more.

469
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:19,540
Which is precisely why the Awakening
is performed by an elder.

470
01:10:19,707 --> 01:10:22,043
You do not possess
the necessary skills.

471
01:10:22,210 --> 01:10:25,046
But I did see Lucian. I shot him.
You must believe me.

472
01:10:25,213 --> 01:10:28,384
The chain has never been broken.
Not once.

473
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:30,803
Not in 14 centuries.

474
01:10:30,970 --> 01:10:35,057
Not since we elders first began
to leapfrog through time.

475
01:10:35,224 --> 01:10:38,310
One awake, two asleep.
That's the way of it.

476
01:10:38,477 --> 01:10:41,689
It is Marcus' turn to reign,
not mine.

477
01:10:41,981 --> 01:10:43,232
There's been a complication.

478
01:10:43,399 --> 01:10:44,817
But I had no choice.

479
01:10:44,984 --> 01:10:46,694
The coven is in danger,
and Michael is the key-

480
01:10:50,739 --> 01:10:51,782
Ah, yes.

481
01:10:53,075 --> 01:10:55,244
The Lycan.

482
01:10:57,287 --> 01:10:59,248
Please.

483
01:10:59,748 --> 01:11:02,084
Give me the chance
to get proof you require.

484
01:11:02,251 --> 01:11:03,419
Fine.

485
01:11:03,585 --> 01:11:07,589
I will leave it to
Kraven to collect the proof...

486
01:11:08,090 --> 01:11:10,759
if there is any.

487
01:11:12,094 --> 01:11:14,096
How could you trust him over me?

488
01:11:14,263 --> 01:11:19,436
Because he is not the one who
has been tainted by an animal.

489
01:11:21,646 --> 01:11:24,024
I love you...

490
01:11:26,484 --> 01:11:30,739
like a daughter,
but you leave me with no choice.

491
01:11:30,905 --> 01:11:33,950
These rules are in place
for a good reason,

492
01:11:34,117 --> 01:11:39,456
and they are the only reason
we have survived this long.

493
01:11:43,585 --> 01:11:47,547
You will not be shown
an ounce of leniency.

494
01:11:48,048 --> 01:11:53,553
When Amelia arrives, the Council
will convene and decide your fate.

495
01:11:54,137 --> 01:11:57,307
You have broken the chain
and the Covenant!

496
01:11:57,474 --> 01:11:59,893
You must be judged!

497
01:12:24,168 --> 01:12:27,338
You should've listened to me
and stayed out of this.

498
01:12:27,505 --> 01:12:32,051
Now you'll be lucky if I can convince
the Council to spare your life.

499
01:12:32,218 --> 01:12:33,969
Tell me.

500
01:12:34,136 --> 01:12:38,599
Did you have the nerve to cut the skin
from his arm, or did Lucian do it for you?

501
01:12:44,605 --> 01:12:46,857
Mark my words.

502
01:12:47,024 --> 01:12:49,944
Soon, you'll be
seeing things my way.

503
01:12:59,955 --> 01:13:03,542
No one opens this door.
Understood?

504
01:13:05,210 --> 01:13:09,297
I can't afford to have my future queen
run off with that Lycan again.

505
01:13:47,754 --> 01:13:49,423
Shit.

506
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:03,687
Change of plans. Amelia will be
picked up by Soren and his team.

507
01:14:03,854 --> 01:14:05,105
That's our job.

508
01:14:05,272 --> 01:14:07,774
Not anymore.

509
01:16:59,324 --> 01:17:00,492
Why are you helping me?

510
01:17:00,658 --> 01:17:03,411
I'm not. I'm helping me.

511
01:17:42,201 --> 01:17:43,202
What's going on?

512
01:17:43,369 --> 01:17:45,996
The perimeter sensor's been tripped.

513
01:17:46,163 --> 01:17:48,582
We're locking down the mansion.

514
01:17:49,041 --> 01:17:52,002
It's Selene. She's escaped,
to go to him, to Michael.

515
01:17:52,795 --> 01:17:57,635
I want that Lycan's head on a plate.

516
01:19:28,435 --> 01:19:30,229
We need to go.

517
01:19:59,509 --> 01:20:00,635
Get down!

518
01:20:03,471 --> 01:20:06,182
Go. Go.

519
01:20:12,230 --> 01:20:14,524
Jump.
Are you fucking kidding me?

520
01:21:37,067 --> 01:21:38,068
Any luck?

521
01:21:38,234 --> 01:21:40,070
False alarm.

522
01:21:40,236 --> 01:21:44,699
The dogs would've been all over it
if anything had gotten near that fence.

523
01:21:44,866 --> 01:21:46,242
Amelia should have arrived by now.

524
01:21:46,409 --> 01:21:48,244
Yes.

525
01:21:52,749 --> 01:21:57,045
Look, I want you to slip off the property
and find out what's keeping her.

526
01:21:57,212 --> 01:21:59,005
You've got it.

527
01:22:37,212 --> 01:22:39,840
Maybe we should pull over
and dose him.

528
01:22:40,006 --> 01:22:43,009
Fuck him. He'll be all right.
We're almost there.

529
01:23:48,368 --> 01:23:52,206
Oh, shit. He's not gonna make it.
Pull over. Pull over!

530
01:24:11,099 --> 01:24:12,726
Get the kit.

531
01:24:26,281 --> 01:24:28,408
Stick him. Stick him.

532
01:24:39,629 --> 01:24:41,381
My lord.

533
01:24:42,507 --> 01:24:45,176
Viktor wants
to speak with you.

534
01:25:10,702 --> 01:25:12,537
My lord.

535
01:25:16,916 --> 01:25:19,586
I sent for Selene...

536
01:25:19,961 --> 01:25:22,005
not you.

537
01:25:22,589 --> 01:25:25,258
She's defied your orders and...

538
01:25:27,052 --> 01:25:28,971
fled the mansion, my lord.

539
01:25:29,138 --> 01:25:34,268
Your incompetence
is becoming most taxing.

540
01:25:34,435 --> 01:25:37,396
It's not my fault.
She's become obsessed,

541
01:25:37,563 --> 01:25:40,983
thinks that I'm at the core
of some ridiculous conspiracy.

542
01:25:41,150 --> 01:25:43,152
And here's my proof.

543
01:25:57,416 --> 01:26:00,669
Now, I want you to tell them
exactly what you told me.

544
01:26:08,344 --> 01:26:11,513
All right, all right.

545
01:26:13,015 --> 01:26:18,189
We've been searching for someone
with a special trait.

546
01:26:18,356 --> 01:26:22,443
A direct descendant
of Alexander Corvinus...

547
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:24,362
Hungarian...

548
01:26:24,528 --> 01:26:26,405
a warlord...

549
01:26:26,572 --> 01:26:31,160
who came to power in the early
seasons of the fifth century.

550
01:26:31,327 --> 01:26:37,792
Just in time to watch a plague
ravage his village.

551
01:26:38,876 --> 01:26:42,046
He alone survived.

552
01:26:43,339 --> 01:26:48,177
Somehow, his body
was able to change the disease,

553
01:26:48,344 --> 01:26:52,181
mold it to his benefit.

554
01:26:52,348 --> 01:26:57,520
He became the first true immortal.

555
01:27:06,029 --> 01:27:09,866
And years later,
he fathered at least two children

556
01:27:10,033 --> 01:27:12,327
who inherited this same trait.

557
01:27:12,494 --> 01:27:15,789
The sons of the Corvinus clan.

558
01:27:15,956 --> 01:27:19,167
One bitten by bat, one by wolf,

559
01:27:19,334 --> 01:27:24,631
one to walk the lonely road
of mortality as a human.

560
01:27:24,798 --> 01:27:28,093
It's a ridiculous legend. Nothing!

561
01:27:29,845 --> 01:27:31,346
That may be...

562
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:35,475
but our species
do have a common ancestor.

563
01:27:36,351 --> 01:27:40,022
A mutation of the original virus

564
01:27:40,188 --> 01:27:42,399
is directly linked to his bloodline.

565
01:27:42,566 --> 01:27:47,404
There is a descendant
of Corvinus lying there...

566
01:27:48,613 --> 01:27:50,699
not three feet from you.

567
01:27:50,866 --> 01:27:52,617
Yes.

568
01:27:53,326 --> 01:27:58,416
But he's already a Vampire.
We needed a pure source.

569
01:27:59,292 --> 01:28:04,547
Untainted. An exact duplicate
of the original virus...

570
01:28:04,922 --> 01:28:06,883
which we learned

571
01:28:07,050 --> 01:28:11,471
was hidden away in the genetic
code of his human descendants

572
01:28:11,637 --> 01:28:16,642
and passed along
in its latent form...

573
01:28:17,894 --> 01:28:20,730
down through the ages...

574
01:28:20,897 --> 01:28:25,735
all the way to Michael Corvin.

575
01:28:26,903 --> 01:28:31,824
For years, we tried to combine
their bloodlines.

576
01:28:35,244 --> 01:28:38,414
And for years we failed.

577
01:28:38,956 --> 01:28:41,125
It was useless.

578
01:28:42,502 --> 01:28:45,171
Even at the cellular level,
our species seemed destined

579
01:28:45,338 --> 01:28:47,174
to destroy each other.

580
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:54,681
That is, until we found Michael.

581
01:28:57,851 --> 01:29:02,940
The Corvinus strain allows
for a perfect union.

582
01:29:05,109 --> 01:29:08,445
A triple-celled platelet...

583
01:29:09,613 --> 01:29:14,535
which holds unspeakable power.

584
01:29:14,952 --> 01:29:18,163
There can be no such union.

585
01:29:18,997 --> 01:29:20,874
And to speak of it is heresy.

586
01:29:21,667 --> 01:29:23,585
We'll see.

587
01:29:24,795 --> 01:29:29,216
Once Lucian has injected himself
with Michael's blood.

588
01:29:29,716 --> 01:29:31,385
Lucian is dead.

589
01:29:31,552 --> 01:29:35,055
According to whom?

590
01:29:45,483 --> 01:29:47,527
I need you to do something for me.

591
01:29:54,492 --> 01:29:57,412
I can assure you, my child

592
01:29:57,579 --> 01:29:59,914
Kraven will pay with his life.

593
01:30:20,977 --> 01:30:25,275
Soon, this house
will lie in ruins.

594
01:30:25,442 --> 01:30:26,443
Not before you.

595
01:30:26,610 --> 01:30:27,903
No, no, no, wait. Wait!

596
01:30:28,069 --> 01:30:31,072
You and you alone
will know the truth of this.

597
01:30:34,910 --> 01:30:40,498
If Lucian was able to get his hands
on the blood of a Pure-Born,

598
01:30:40,665 --> 01:30:45,754
a powerful elder like Amelia...

599
01:30:45,921 --> 01:30:49,633
or yourself...

600
01:30:49,799 --> 01:30:54,471
and inject it along
with Michael's blood.

601
01:30:54,638 --> 01:30:56,806
Abomination.

602
01:30:56,973 --> 01:30:59,142
Half-Vampire,

603
01:30:59,309 --> 01:31:03,647
half-Lycan,
but stronger than both.

604
01:31:22,750 --> 01:31:24,126
I need to speak with Kahn.

605
01:31:31,717 --> 01:31:33,427
My lord.

606
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:38,057
The Council members
have been assassinated.

607
01:31:41,435 --> 01:31:43,187
What of Amelia?

608
01:31:43,354 --> 01:31:44,730
They bled her dry.

609
01:31:47,525 --> 01:31:50,987
It has already begun, huh?

610
01:32:02,540 --> 01:32:04,959
I'm sorry I doubted you.

611
01:32:05,544 --> 01:32:10,799
Fear not, my child,
absolution will be yours...

612
01:32:12,676 --> 01:32:17,764
the moment you kill the descendant
of Corvinus, this...

613
01:32:18,390 --> 01:32:20,600
Michael.

614
01:32:56,137 --> 01:33:00,475
You've been given an enzyme
to stop the change.

615
01:33:00,641 --> 01:33:06,105
It may take a little time
for the grogginess to dissipate.

616
01:33:12,653 --> 01:33:14,447
That's enough!

617
01:33:14,614 --> 01:33:19,077
Just... go and see
what's keeping Raze, will you?

618
01:33:20,745 --> 01:33:22,455
I really must apologize.

619
01:33:23,122 --> 01:33:26,042
He's in desperate need
of a lesson in manners.

620
01:33:26,501 --> 01:33:30,004
Speaking of manners,
where are mine? Forgive me.

621
01:33:30,171 --> 01:33:32,256
I'm Lucian.

622
01:33:34,342 --> 01:33:36,636
I need to go.

623
01:33:38,012 --> 01:33:39,555
I need to get back.

624
01:33:41,182 --> 01:33:43,643
There's no going back.

625
01:33:44,310 --> 01:33:46,814
There's no going anywhere.

626
01:33:46,980 --> 01:33:51,944
The Vampires will kill you on sight.
Just for being what you are.

627
01:33:52,111 --> 01:33:53,904
One of us.

628
01:33:57,157 --> 01:34:00,160
You are one of us.

629
01:34:03,414 --> 01:34:04,706
What are you doing?

630
01:34:05,124 --> 01:34:06,166
What are you doing?

631
01:34:06,333 --> 01:34:08,919
Bringing an end to this conflict.

632
01:34:15,884 --> 01:34:18,512
Your war, it has nothing
to do with me.

633
01:34:18,679 --> 01:34:20,639
My war?

634
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:45,624
No!

635
01:34:46,041 --> 01:34:47,543
No!

636
01:34:48,377 --> 01:34:50,880
No!

637
01:35:22,244 --> 01:35:24,705
No!

638
01:35:27,250 --> 01:35:29,044
No! No!

639
01:35:38,595 --> 01:35:42,432
Sonja!

640
01:36:45,913 --> 01:36:49,000
They forced you to watch her die.

641
01:36:51,335 --> 01:36:53,212
Sonja.

642
01:36:54,839 --> 01:36:57,508
That's what started the war.

643
01:37:00,803 --> 01:37:04,015
I saw it happen as if I were there.

644
01:37:09,187 --> 01:37:11,773
We were slaves once.

645
01:37:12,941 --> 01:37:16,695
The daylight guardians
of the Vampires.

646
01:37:18,530 --> 01:37:21,241
I was born in servitude...

647
01:37:23,035 --> 01:37:25,871
yet I harbored them no ill will.

648
01:37:26,830 --> 01:37:29,750
I even took a Vampire for my bride.

649
01:37:30,709 --> 01:37:32,711
It was forbidden...

650
01:37:32,961 --> 01:37:35,213
our union.

651
01:37:35,380 --> 01:37:40,344
Viktor feared
a blending of the species.

652
01:37:42,137 --> 01:37:44,431
Feared it so much...

653
01:37:45,557 --> 01:37:47,601
he killed her.

654
01:37:48,685 --> 01:37:50,896
His own daughter...

655
01:37:52,064 --> 01:37:54,316
burnt alive...

656
01:37:56,736 --> 01:37:58,696
for loving me.

657
01:38:01,824 --> 01:38:04,535
This is his war...

658
01:38:04,702 --> 01:38:06,746
Viktor's...

659
01:38:08,122 --> 01:38:11,292
and he's spent
the last 600 years

660
01:38:12,043 --> 01:38:15,213
exterminating my species.

661
01:38:16,422 --> 01:38:19,092
What are they gonna do to Selene?

662
01:38:21,928 --> 01:38:23,429
We have company.

663
01:38:24,847 --> 01:38:26,557
I thought we had a deal.

664
01:38:26,724 --> 01:38:28,685
Patience.

665
01:38:30,812 --> 01:38:32,438
Kraven.

666
01:38:32,605 --> 01:38:35,942
These are matters
to be discussed in private.

667
01:38:36,943 --> 01:38:41,614
Please escort our guests
downstairs.

668
01:38:57,549 --> 01:39:00,635
The Council has been destroyed.

669
01:39:01,469 --> 01:39:04,305
Soon, you will have it all.

670
01:39:04,472 --> 01:39:10,478
Both great covens and an ironclad
peace treaty with the Lycans.

671
01:39:10,645 --> 01:39:15,024
Who I trust will not be forgotten
when the spoils are tabulated.

672
01:39:15,191 --> 01:39:19,279
How do you expect me to assume control
now that Viktor's been awakened?

673
01:39:19,446 --> 01:39:22,991
There's no defeating him.
He grows stronger as we speak.

674
01:39:23,158 --> 01:39:27,328
And that is precisely why
I need Michael.

675
01:39:27,495 --> 01:39:29,831
If Viktor were so easy to dispatch...

676
01:39:30,415 --> 01:39:33,501
you'd have done it yourself
centuries ago.

677
01:39:44,346 --> 01:39:46,599
Exit shaft! Move it!

678
01:39:49,643 --> 01:39:51,479
Son of a bitch!

679
01:40:05,826 --> 01:40:07,995
Oh, shit!

680
01:40:21,008 --> 01:40:22,676
It's Viktor.

681
01:40:22,843 --> 01:40:24,471
Yes.

682
01:40:24,930 --> 01:40:28,225
And if you had done your job,
he'd still be in hibernation.

683
01:40:34,231 --> 01:40:36,107
Where the hell is Raze?

684
01:40:39,277 --> 01:40:41,404
Is there another way out?

685
01:40:42,239 --> 01:40:45,202
I guess it never occurred to you
that you might actually

686
01:40:45,203 --> 01:40:47,703
have to bleed to pull off this coup.

687
01:40:51,289 --> 01:40:53,917
Don't even think about leaving.

688
01:41:15,439 --> 01:41:19,360
Silver nitrate.
Bet you weren't expecting that.

689
01:41:28,619 --> 01:41:31,622
Come on! Move! Move! Move!
Move! Move!

690
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:55,834
Lucian.

691
01:44:51,827 --> 01:44:53,579
Selene!

692
01:44:54,872 --> 01:44:56,499
Selene!

693
01:45:42,796 --> 01:45:44,631
Not yet.

694
01:50:34,678 --> 01:50:37,097
I have to get you out.
Viktor's on his way.

695
01:50:37,264 --> 01:50:40,225
And he won't be satisfied
until every Lycan's dead.

696
01:50:41,101 --> 01:50:43,687
They'll kill you too,
just for helping me.

697
01:50:44,020 --> 01:50:45,397
I know.

698
01:51:08,628 --> 01:51:10,964
I know what started the war.

699
01:53:21,098 --> 01:53:23,017
That's enough.
You're coming with me!

700
01:53:24,059 --> 01:53:26,645
I hope I live long enough to see
Viktor choke the life from you!

701
01:53:26,854 --> 01:53:28,856
I bet you do.

702
01:53:29,356 --> 01:53:33,027
But let me tell you a little something
about your beloved dark father.

703
01:53:34,194 --> 01:53:36,697
He's the one who killed your family.

704
01:53:37,031 --> 01:53:38,866
Not the Lycans.

705
01:53:39,366 --> 01:53:41,577
Never could follow his own rules.

706
01:53:41,744 --> 01:53:44,164
Said he couldn't abide the taste
of livestock.

707
01:53:44,331 --> 01:53:48,543
So every once in a while, he went out
and gorged himself on human blood.

708
01:53:49,377 --> 01:53:51,338
I kept his secrets...

709
01:53:51,504 --> 01:53:53,048
cleaned up the mess.

710
01:53:53,548 --> 01:53:55,508
But it was he...

711
01:53:55,675 --> 01:53:57,385
who crept room to room

712
01:53:57,552 --> 01:54:00,930
dispatching everyone
close to your heart.

713
01:54:01,848 --> 01:54:03,975
But when he got to you,

714
01:54:04,225 --> 01:54:08,104
he just couldn't bear the thought
of draining you dry.

715
01:54:08,271 --> 01:54:13,360
You, who reminded him so much
of his precious Sonja...

716
01:54:14,277 --> 01:54:18,365
the daughter
he condemned to death.

717
01:54:18,823 --> 01:54:19,908
Lies.

718
01:54:20,075 --> 01:54:21,951
Believe what you want.

719
01:54:22,911 --> 01:54:24,579
Now come on.

720
01:54:24,746 --> 01:54:27,040
Your place is by my side.

721
01:54:34,090 --> 01:54:36,050
So be it.

722
01:55:05,121 --> 01:55:06,414
Bite him!

723
01:55:09,959 --> 01:55:12,169
Half-Vampire...

724
01:55:12,336 --> 01:55:14,130
half-Lycan...

725
01:55:14,296 --> 01:55:17,174
but stronger than both.

726
01:55:42,785 --> 01:55:45,288
What the hell are you doing?

727
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:48,541
You may have killed me...

728
01:55:49,333 --> 01:55:50,585
cousin.

729
01:55:50,752 --> 01:55:52,754
But my will...

730
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:55,506
is done regardless.

731
01:56:35,672 --> 01:56:37,549
Where is he?

732
01:56:38,634 --> 01:56:39,885
Where's Kraven?

733
01:57:01,240 --> 01:57:03,576
Forgive me, my child.

734
01:57:04,911 --> 01:57:06,788
It wasn't the Lycans.

735
01:57:08,915 --> 01:57:10,750
It was you.

736
01:57:17,632 --> 01:57:19,592
Leave us.

737
01:57:38,570 --> 01:57:40,947
How could you bear my trust

738
01:57:41,114 --> 01:57:43,449
knowing that you'd
killed my family?

739
01:57:44,617 --> 01:57:46,327
Yes.

740
01:57:46,953 --> 01:57:48,788
I have taken from you.

741
01:57:50,415 --> 01:57:53,502
But I have given so much more.

742
01:57:54,461 --> 01:57:59,633
Is it not a fair trade, the life I have
granted you? The gift of immortality?

743
01:57:59,842 --> 01:58:02,595
And the life of your daughter?

744
01:58:02,928 --> 01:58:05,347
Your own flesh and blood?

745
01:58:26,368 --> 01:58:29,079
I loved my daughter!

746
01:58:31,373 --> 01:58:33,751
But the abomination growing
in her womb

747
01:58:33,918 --> 01:58:36,629
was a betrayal of me
and of the coven!

748
01:58:41,800 --> 01:58:45,639
I did what was necessary
to protect the species,

749
01:58:45,805 --> 01:58:49,225
as I am forced to do yet again.

750
01:58:53,271 --> 01:58:55,357
No!

751
02:01:47,699 --> 02:01:49,326
Time to die.

752
02:05:09,239 --> 02:05:11,950
Though I cannot predict the future,

753
02:05:12,117 --> 02:05:15,704
the consequences of tonight
will reverberate through the halls

754
02:05:15,871 --> 02:05:18,999
of both great covens
for many years to come.

755
02:05:20,459 --> 02:05:23,254
Two Vampire elders
have been slain,

756
02:05:23,421 --> 02:05:25,673
one by my own hand.

757
02:05:27,425 --> 02:05:31,262
Soon, Marcus will take the throne.

758
02:05:32,513 --> 02:05:37,101
And a tide of anger and retribution
will spill out into the night.

759
02:05:38,853 --> 02:05:41,522
Differences will be set aside.

760
02:05:42,106 --> 02:05:44,442
Allegiances will be made.

761
02:05:44,984 --> 02:05:46,569
And soon...

762
02:05:46,736 --> 02:05:49,405
I will become the hunted.
