<b>No, I'm not!</b>

51
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,890
<b>I won't let anything defeat me!</b>

52

<b>When will you</b>

53

<b>I want to be a Sword of Justice!</b>

<b>So what do you think?</b>

58
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,430
<b>Keldeo's gotten fairly strong...</b>

59
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,320
<b>Do you think we should allow</b>
<b>a battle with Kyurem?</b>

60
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,870
<b>No!</b>

61
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,600
<b>Keldeo is still</b>
<b>unable to use its sword.</b>

62
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,710
<b>That's true...</b>

63
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,400
<b>Once the true weight of</b>
<b>the sword is learned</b>

64
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,910
<b>and able to be used...</b>

65
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,510
<b>...then Keldeo will be able to</b>
<b>become a sword of justice!</b>

66
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,920
<b>Always the cautious one,</b>
<b>aren't you, Cobalion?</b>

67
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,150
<b>I heard everything you said!</b>

68
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,850
<b>What do you mean,</b>
<b>"weight of my sword"?</b>

69
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,990
<b>- You see...</b>
<b>- Terrakion!</b>

70
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,650
<b>You must think for yourself!</b>

71
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:45,260
<b>The truth is I don't</b>
<b>really know either!</b>

72
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,460
<b>l'm going to battle Kyurem!</b>

73
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,100
<b>No!</b>

<b>all this time!</b>

75
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,300
<b>l'm ready to battle</b>
<b>even the strongest Pokemon!</b>

76
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,640
<b>You're not ready yet.</b>

77
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,010
<b>I agree.</b>

78
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,870
<b>Let's train a little more,</b>
<b>all right?</b>

79
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,510
<b>Keldeo's not here!</b>

80
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,340

<b>Then I'll be a Sword of Justice!</b>

83

280
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,970
<b>This Dragon-type Pokemon</b>

<b>with Zekrom and Reshiram.</b>

<b>We're guessing.</b>

298
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,109
<b>...but we think it</b>
<b>might've been Kyurem.</b>

299
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,110
<b>What?</b>

300
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:13,539

<b>Kyurem lives in an abandoned</b>
<b>mine up over the mountains.</b>

<b>But it came and attacked us</b>
<b>out of nowhere!</b>

306
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:28,010
<b>Then, Kyurem</b>
<b>battled with Keldeo...</b>

307
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,060
<b>So that's Keldeo?</b>

308

<b>Keldeo's its name!</b>

<b>- Whoa, so that's it...</b>
<b>- Pikachu.</b>

<b>But what about the Swords</b>
