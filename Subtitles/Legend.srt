00:01:12,564 --> 00:01:14,892
<i>London in the 1960's. Everyone had
a story about the Krays.</i>

4
00:01:15,664 --> 00:01:18,672
<i>You could walk into any pub to
hear a lie or two about them.</i>

5
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,200
<i>But I was there
and I'm not careless with the truth.</i>

6
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:29,072
<i>They were brothers, but bound by more
than blood. They were twins as well.</i>

7
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,472
<i>Counterparts. Gangster-princes
of the city they meant to conquer.</i>

8
00:01:34,908 --> 00:01:38,132
<i>Ron Kray was a one-man London mob.</i>

9
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,032
<i>Bloodthirsty, illogical
and funny as well.</i>

10
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:44,624
<i>My Reggie was different.</i>

11
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,392
<i>Once in a lifetime do
you find a street fighting man like Reg.</i>

12
00:01:48,632 --> 00:01:53,848
<i>Believe me when I say it took a lot of
love for me to hate him the way I do.</i>

13
00:02:05,632 --> 00:02:07,964
Good morning, Albie.
Good morning, sir.

14
00:02:09,092 --> 00:02:11,300
Tea for two?
Yeah, Albie.

15
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,940
Hello, boys!

16
00:02:19,832 --> 00:02:22,672
How you doing? You all right? Put
your cup of tea in, do you fancy it?

17
00:02:23,372 --> 00:02:24,664
Yeah?
No?

18
00:02:25,924 --> 00:02:28,809
What's this? The old Dagenham Angila?
Ought to

19
00:02:28,821 --> 00:02:31,656
60 in .. what? 40 minutes
or sommit like that?

20
00:02:32,264 --> 00:02:37,100
Cor, it's a bit of you in that, innit? All
black and cramped and very sharp. Yeah.

21
00:02:37,748 --> 00:02:40,224
This one's really milky... for you.

22
00:02:40,432 --> 00:02:43,348
Why don't you fuck off, Kray?
Oh, I will, I will.

23
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:46,244
Y'know, I don't want to keep you,
you know, what with them... them,

24
00:02:46,256 --> 00:02:48,808
y'know, rapists and murderers you
got to lock away, eh Nipper?

25
00:02:48,924 --> 00:02:53,300
Where do you take a turd in there?
Probably just hold it in, don't you?

26
00:02:56,832 --> 00:03:00,180
Alright, then, have a lovely day. Cheer up.
It's nearly Christmas.

27
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,792
Forget about that.

28
00:03:02,872 --> 00:03:06,492
Where's me driver, where's Frank? He can't
get out of bed in the morning, Reg.

29
00:03:06,556 --> 00:03:10,416
He what? He ain't here, he ain't showed up.
He's heart ain't in it.

30
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,719
Alright. OK, well let's
go get him then, should

31
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:14,640
we? Where is he? On
Ormsby Street, yeah?

32
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:17,121
Yeah, come and jump in.
I'll give you a lift. Nah, you're

33
00:03:17,133 --> 00:03:19,300
alright, I'm going to walk. It's
a lovely day for it.

34
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,340
Don't forget this lot.
They're very important I won't.

35
00:03:24,664 --> 00:03:28,466
Come on!
I shall walk incredibly slowly!

36
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,092
Hi, Vera. How you doing?
You good? Yeah. Lovely.

37
00:03:38,764 --> 00:03:41,452
Rita, I was gonna knock on your door.
But me

38
00:03:41,464 --> 00:03:44,224
mum said you left that
in her kitchen. I did!

39
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:46,548
Is that yours?
It is! Oh, thanks ever so much!

40
00:03:46,716 --> 00:03:48,300
No problem, you're welcome.
Thanks, Reg.

41
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,592
Eastenders.

42
00:03:54,124 --> 00:03:59,424
They won't talk to a policeman,
but they'll kiss a gangster. Ey?

43
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,380
Filthy, cockney bastards.

44
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,100
How about we clean your car for ya?

45
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:25,708
Is Frank about?

46
00:04:27,664 --> 00:04:29,080
Frank!

47
00:04:32,032 --> 00:04:36,448
Who are you?
I'm Frances. Frank's sister.

48
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,625
Hear about, I recognize you.
See, I recognize you. You was

49
00:04:39,637 --> 00:04:42,424
a little bit younger, then.
You got grown up, didn't ya?

50
00:04:42,872 --> 00:04:44,308
It happens.

51
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,424
What have you got there?
A sweet.

52
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,108
That's not any sweet, is it? That's a Lemon
Sherbert, that is. Mind if I have a crack?

53
00:04:55,548 --> 00:04:58,856
Go on.
Thanks.

54
00:05:00,764 --> 00:05:02,300
Ah, that's nice, innit?

55
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,932
You're not supposed to chew it!
No?

56
00:05:09,764 --> 00:05:11,972
How else am I supposed to
get to the sherbie bit?

57
00:05:13,074 --> 00:05:15,380
By being patient.
Nah.

58
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:18,248
Being patient doesn't get
you what you want, does it?

59
00:05:21,264 --> 00:05:23,464
Half a minute,
Reg. Be right down.

60
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:26,516
Is he in trouble?
Yea, he is.

61
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,724
Will you go out with me?
I'll go easy on him if you do.

62
00:05:34,264 --> 00:05:37,908
Alright, but not for that reason.

63
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,900
Saturday night?

64
00:05:40,464 --> 00:05:42,565
Who are you talking to?
You're half-dressed talking

65
00:05:42,577 --> 00:05:44,772
to a man in the door. What's
wrong with you, Frances?

66
00:05:44,792 --> 00:05:48,616
Get back in the kitchen. Finish
them dishes. This is yours.

67
00:05:49,472 --> 00:05:50,640
Thank you.

68
00:06:03,048 --> 00:06:07,100
If you oversleep again, Frank,
alright? It's back to the cheese shop.

69
00:06:07,124 --> 00:06:11,116
Or the fish shop, or whatever
shop it is you come from. Print.

70
00:06:12,218 --> 00:06:13,423
Print shop.

71
00:06:14,924 --> 00:06:17,832
Oh yeah? Well you'll be back to the
fucking shit shop, you understand? Yup.

72
00:06:19,672 --> 00:06:21,200
What does your sister do?

73
00:06:21,932 --> 00:06:24,971
Oh, she goes to one
of those, uh, Pitman

74
00:06:24,983 --> 00:06:28,332
colleges. Y'know? Typing? Shorthand?
Yeah?

75
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,900
Well she's got a bit of class, mate.
She's

76
00:06:31,912 --> 00:06:34,064
very elegant. Where have
you been hiding her?

77
00:06:34,232 --> 00:06:38,900
She's been away.
She's a bit, umm, fragile, Reg.

78
00:06:39,002 --> 00:06:41,316
Oh yeah?
Yeah.

79
00:06:44,016 --> 00:06:45,516
Hmm.
Stop here, Frank.

80
00:06:52,948 --> 00:06:56,032
Four minutes. One job.

81
00:06:59,132 --> 00:07:01,324
How long do you think
it will take for him to

82
00:07:01,336 --> 00:07:03,780
figure it, Albie?
A little bit of cat and mouse.

83
00:07:09,408 --> 00:07:14,740
<i>Nipper Read was the copper on the Krays
case and he made his presence known.</i>

84
00:07:16,592 --> 00:07:19,000
<i>He was heavy-footed, as they say.</i>

85
00:07:31,024 --> 00:07:34,189
<i>So I stared at the back
of this geezer's head</i>

86
00:07:34,201 --> 00:07:37,040
<i>and the whole time I'm thinking...
umm:</i>

87
00:07:39,424 --> 00:07:43,716
Give Ron Kray your sausage.

88
00:07:47,048 --> 00:07:49,716
Give Ron...

89
00:07:51,632 --> 00:07:53,800
your fucking sausage.

90
00:07:56,348 --> 00:07:57,600
Y'know?

91
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,592
I was drilling my eyes into
the back of his head...

92
00:08:04,172 --> 00:08:09,624
Until I'm not even thinking it anymore.
I'm not even thinking.

93
00:08:11,856 --> 00:08:13,564
I'm broadcasting it.

94
00:08:14,316 --> 00:08:17,180
Until he turns around and you
know what he says? He says...

95
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:22,264
"Hey, Ron, do you fancy my sausage?
I've got no appetite for it."

96
00:08:24,148 --> 00:08:25,472
Interesting.

97
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,332
<i>When my future brother in law
said 'interesting'... Ain't it?</i>

98
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,655
<i>It meant he had no
fucking idea what he, or</i>

99
00:08:31,667 --> 00:08:33,548
<i>you or anyone else was
talking about.</i>

100
00:08:34,608 --> 00:08:36,232
Fascinating, Ron.

101
00:08:38,264 --> 00:08:39,864
Fascinating.

102
00:08:40,232 --> 00:08:44,624
<i>Ron had been sentenced to three years in
prison for grievous bodily harm.</i>

103
00:08:44,964 --> 00:08:47,356
<i>Near the end of his
sentence, he was certified</i>

104
00:08:47,368 --> 00:08:49,572
<i>insane and remanded to a
mental hospital.</i>

105
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,552
<i>What was wanting was a
friendly psychiatrist.</i>

106
00:08:52,592 --> 00:08:57,748
Roger, when you say you want
me to raspberry this man...

107
00:08:58,116 --> 00:09:00,468
I'm not sure of your vernacular.
What do you mean?

108
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:05,748
Raspberry ripple. Cripple.-
You want to cripple someone.

109
00:09:06,692 --> 00:09:08,792
Yup.
That's right- And why is that?

110
00:09:09,224 --> 00:09:13,416
Because, doctor, I'm afraid
he may not be inclined...

111
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:19,140
to provide a favorable evaluation to
my employer. And who is your employer?

112
00:09:20,716 --> 00:09:22,216
Ronnie Kray.

113
00:09:23,524 --> 00:09:25,648
Is there hope, Doctor?

114
00:09:29,064 --> 00:09:30,348
Excuse me a moment.

115
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:33,832
Take your time.

116
00:09:35,516 --> 00:09:38,799
Ronald Kray possesses
possibly the soundest mind

117
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:41,972
I've seen in 26 years in
psychiatric practice.

118
00:09:42,792 --> 00:09:47,372
In my view, to keep him here would
be a waste of public resources.

119
00:09:54,348 --> 00:09:57,264
A lifetime's integrity down the toilet.

120
00:09:57,332 --> 00:10:01,640
<i>The Queen would survive,
but God save the rest of us.</i>

121
00:10:06,516 --> 00:10:07,832
Mr. Kray?

122
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,534
I hope you know what you're doing.
Yeah, I know what I'm doing. I'm

123
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:14,848
going back to London. I'm going
to take the... take the car...

124
00:10:14,878 --> 00:10:19,802
Your brother has no real idea who or what
he is. Nor does he trust his own senses.

125
00:10:19,816 --> 00:10:23,116
I've never seen a man
so desperately in need of reassurance.

126
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,320
We all like a nice little
compliment now and again, don't we?

127
00:10:25,348 --> 00:10:27,952
Your brother is arbitrary,
violent and a psychopath.

128
00:10:27,964 --> 00:10:30,048
Alright. Probably
paranoid schizophrenic.

129
00:10:32,308 --> 00:10:35,292
What I'm trying to tell you is
that he's off his fucking rocker.

130
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:39,284
It's called Stemetil. You need
to give it to your brother

131
00:10:39,296 --> 00:10:42,064
twice a day, or there's going
to be serious trouble.

132
00:10:49,742 --> 00:10:52,925
<i>Oy Frances, the car is outside.</i>

133
00:11:02,654 --> 00:11:05,989
Oh, heh, You've got glamour, Frances.
You're like an East End starlet.

134
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,359
East End harlot's more like it.

135
00:11:08,616 --> 00:11:11,070
They're trousers, mum.
She doesn't look like a harlot.

136
00:11:11,098 --> 00:11:12,768
What she's wearing doesn't matter.

137
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:16,123
When people see her with Reggie Kray,
they'll think she's a tart.

138
00:11:16,191 --> 00:11:21,796
Why would you say that? He's a gangster,
Frances. The Krays are gangsters.

139
00:11:22,213 --> 00:11:24,130
Well, I think he's sweet.
Oh, God.

140
00:11:25,316 --> 00:11:28,278
And I'm going to kiss him, you hear me?

141
00:11:33,012 --> 00:11:34,825
Hello.
Hello.

142
00:11:40,015 --> 00:11:41,825
You look lovely.

143
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,682
And so do you.

144
00:11:59,148 --> 00:12:01,974
Hello. This is Big Pat. Hello, Bit Pat!
Reggie.

145
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:04,561
How are you doing, you all right, mate?
You all right? Nice to see you.

146
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:06,917
Big Pat's here to keep the riffraff out.

147
00:12:07,423 --> 00:12:10,591
Always. So how come you're
letting us in, then, mate?

148
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:13,921
Have a good night.Thanks.
Thanks, mate. Cheers.

149
00:12:13,985 --> 00:12:16,195
Oh hello, here's trouble. Hold the phone.

150
00:12:16,224 --> 00:12:19,091
Who are you?
How you doing, big man?- All right, boss?

151
00:12:19,767 --> 00:12:21,344
Are you well?
Yeah, I'm fame... I'm fame...

152
00:12:21,364 --> 00:12:22,812
Are you behaving yourself?
Always.

153
00:12:22,832 --> 00:12:24,549
I'm a teddy bear, me.
Go easy.

154
00:12:24,579 --> 00:12:27,422
If he gives you any trouble, come and
speak to me Come. Y'alright, mum

155
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,552
Yeah, I'm good. She's good.- Hello, Reg.

156
00:12:33,472 --> 00:12:36,431
Everybody here knows you.
Yeah, well, I own it. It's my club.

157
00:12:36,699 --> 00:12:39,594
You mean it's your local?
No, I own the place. It's mine.

158
00:12:39,627 --> 00:12:42,007
I've been by here ten times.
I never knew it was yours.

159
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:45,399
Well, you can get away with a lot in life
if you, uh... keep your mouth shut.

160
00:12:45,823 --> 00:12:47,285
That's Teddy Anderson, now.

161
00:12:47,353 --> 00:12:51,697
Hi, Teddy. You doing alright? Good to
see you. How's the family? Excellent.

162
00:12:52,546 --> 00:12:55,360
What?
Those men are frightening.

163
00:12:55,425 --> 00:12:57,450
No, no. They're just East End boxers.
They're

164
00:12:57,462 --> 00:12:59,721
lovely. I let 'em drink
in here for free, y'know.

165
00:13:00,289 --> 00:13:03,700
Reggie, that's Joan Collins.
Yeah, it might be, yeah. We had

166
00:13:03,768 --> 00:13:06,471
that... that... Barbara Windsor
in here the other night.

167
00:13:06,491 --> 00:13:09,330
Really? Yeah, she comes in here
quite a bit actually. She loves it.

168
00:13:09,438 --> 00:13:12,323
And uh... That's my... my formula.
What I like to do is I like

169
00:13:12,335 --> 00:13:15,279
to mix celebrities with a few,
just a few, East End villains.

170
00:13:15,343 --> 00:13:19,315
Y'know, punters, they love it. It's really
good for business. Would you like a seat?

171
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,776
Excuse me, Reg. Do you, uh, got a moment?
No, I don't. That's it. I'm busy. Alright?

172
00:13:24,244 --> 00:13:27,031
This is important, Reg.
And this is important as well, Reg.

173
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:31,435
Alright, alright. Frances,
would you mind if I,

174
00:13:31,447 --> 00:13:34,161
uh, take care of some
business just for a moment?

175
00:13:34,191 --> 00:13:36,800
No, of course not.
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

176
00:13:36,864 --> 00:13:38,709
Sit with her.
What is it?

177
00:13:38,773 --> 00:13:40,167
It's back here.
What?

178
00:13:41,236 --> 00:13:43,156
I'm a firm believer in
the fact if you don't

179
00:13:43,168 --> 00:13:45,271
know, you don't fucking know.
Know what I mean?

180
00:13:50,536 --> 00:13:51,973
Reggie.
How are you, Reg?

181
00:13:52,975 --> 00:13:55,475
Well, I'm alright, I can't complain.
Who'd fucking listen?

182
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:58,236
What is the palaver? Sit down, Reg.
Sit down, please.

183
00:13:59,308 --> 00:14:01,205
Alright.- You had a question
about the taking of the

184
00:14:01,217 --> 00:14:03,126
purple heart business.
Yeah. The pill game... Go on.

185
00:14:03,489 --> 00:14:06,199
Jack here would like to explain himself.
Go on.

186
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:08,618
Go on, Jack. Tell Reggie what you told me.

187
00:14:10,764 --> 00:14:14,059
Well, Reg...
Yeah?

188
00:14:15,336 --> 00:14:19,672
I, uh... thing is, under normal
circumstances... my accountants...

189
00:14:20,813 --> 00:14:23,716
Are you gonna take all fucking night, mate?
Cos I've got things to do.

190
00:14:24,633 --> 00:14:26,595
Tell him, Jack.
Go on, spit it out.

191
00:14:27,695 --> 00:14:30,674
I borrowed a few quid off the top.
Right, alright.

192
00:14:30,838 --> 00:14:32,216
I swallowed a few pills on the side.-
Yeah, there's a simple answer.

193
00:14:32,384 --> 00:14:35,154
Things have been a bit... tight at home

194
00:14:35,218 --> 00:14:37,997
And I was... was just trying to keep the
wife happy.- Trying to keep the wife happy.

195
00:14:38,065 --> 00:14:41,400
Is this what you brought me in here? For
this?- It's important.- This nonsense.

196
00:14:41,769 --> 00:14:43,895
It's important business.
It's important, is it? Yeah.

197
00:14:44,063 --> 00:14:46,789
You should know about this. Right,
alright Let's deal with this business.

198
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:48,654
Alright, tomorrow you
come back to work, yeah?

199
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,441
And you pay back every
fucking penny you owe.

200
00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:52,170
Do you understand?
I was gonna suggest that.

201
00:14:52,219 --> 00:14:55,662
Good. Right. Are we done? Everybody happy?

202
00:14:56,475 --> 00:14:59,029
Alright then. Can I get
back to my fucking evening?

203
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:01,459
Thank you. Thank you very much, Albie.
Cheers.

204
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:04,382
Sorry for wasting your time, Jack.
Thanks.

205
00:15:04,546 --> 00:15:07,834
Thanks for coming in. Here you go, mate.

206
00:15:10,712 --> 00:15:11,997
Good?

207
00:15:13,338 --> 00:15:16,618
Fucking, thieving cunt. You understand...
Get him a tissue.

208
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:21,378
With me? Yeah? Next time I'll
finish you off, you little slag.

209
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:23,816
Get him out of here. Go
on, Fuck him off. Fuck!

210
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,042
Are you fucking off. What did you say?

211
00:15:26,311 --> 00:15:29,045
Don't you swear in my club.
Get him out of here right now.

212
00:15:29,113 --> 00:15:31,740
Don't swear in my club, you wanker.

213
00:15:32,108 --> 00:15:34,264
Now listen, there's something else.
No, there isn't something else,

214
00:15:34,276 --> 00:15:36,320
alright, cos I've got a young lady
in here, and I'm entertaining.

215
00:15:36,484 --> 00:15:37,946
Yeah, but this is...
Lookit.

216
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,720
See that, there? I see
it. I'm entertaining.

217
00:15:39,732 --> 00:15:41,561
Alright? So I'm gonna have
an evening to myself.

218
00:15:41,765 --> 00:15:44,476
This is important business.
Can't be. My business, innit?

219
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:46,454
It's my business. I would know.

220
00:15:46,878 --> 00:15:48,240
G'night, Albie.

221
00:15:51,252 --> 00:15:54,329
Hello. Did I miss anything important?

222
00:15:54,593 --> 00:15:57,973
No, just me.
That? That is important.

223
00:15:58,141 --> 00:16:00,143
Is it?
Very important.

224
00:16:00,951 --> 00:16:03,370
Thank you.
Thank you.

225
00:16:03,485 --> 00:16:05,412
Fuck off!

226
00:16:06,957 --> 00:16:11,878
So uh, your brother told me that you uh...
you're going to college.

227
00:16:12,146 --> 00:16:16,066
Right? To... to study... to be a secretary.
Is that right?

228
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:20,102
Yeah, anything to get out of the East End.
Oh, what's so bad with the East End?

229
00:16:21,154 --> 00:16:25,423
I've just got bigger dreams than pushing
pram or having it with the butcher.

230
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:31,620
I just don't quite know what they are yet.
East End is not that bad.

231
00:16:32,581 --> 00:16:34,692
The center of the earth
could be anywhere you like.

232
00:16:35,456 --> 00:16:37,225
Even here?
Yeah, even here.

233
00:16:37,294 --> 00:16:39,836
In Bethnal Green?
Yeah, in Bethnal Green.

234
00:16:42,807 --> 00:16:44,865
Do you like being a gangster?

235
00:16:50,999 --> 00:16:55,811
I'm not a gangster.
I'm a club owner.

236
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:02,926
I like the money and I like the
respect of being a club owner.

237
00:17:03,466 --> 00:17:05,052
I'm not a gangster.

238
00:17:06,986 --> 00:17:11,742
I could've been a boxer,
y'know, but then ya... hello, mate.

239
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:13,955
I'd end up looking like
some sort of potato and I

240
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:16,038
wouldn't even know what
day of the week it was.

241
00:17:16,206 --> 00:17:19,041
This way at least I know who I am.

242
00:17:19,634 --> 00:17:22,677
I also know that I've made a
little bit of something of myself.

243
00:17:23,802 --> 00:17:25,723
I don't owe the world anything.

244
00:17:27,265 --> 00:17:29,435
So long as the world agrees with you.

245
00:17:30,828 --> 00:17:32,762
I think the world will be alright.

246
00:17:44,441 --> 00:17:48,985
<i>We shall fight on the beaches
. We shall fight on the landing grounds.</i>

247
00:17:49,153 --> 00:17:52,865
<i>We shall fight in the fields
and in the streets.</i>

248
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:57,369
<i>We shall fight in the hills. We shall
never surrender. And if...</i>

249
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,104
Ronnie.

250
00:18:00,836 --> 00:18:02,998
Ronnie, come on out.
You've got visitors, mate.

251
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,963
Watch your step, it's a bit wet.

252
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:10,882
Cor, you alright?
Mmm hmm.

253
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:14,641
You must be Frances.
Hi.

254
00:18:16,015 --> 00:18:17,500
Yeah?

255
00:18:17,937 --> 00:18:20,941
Hello, Frances. Hello. Welcome
to the family. Well, that

256
00:18:20,953 --> 00:18:24,234
is a bit premature, though, isn't it?
*laughs nervously*

257
00:18:26,436 --> 00:18:27,765
Hey, you don't have a
beer that I can have, do

258
00:18:27,777 --> 00:18:29,147
ya, Ron?
Yeah, of course I do, help yourself.

259
00:18:29,315 --> 00:18:31,133
Right. Don't mind if I have a beer, do ya?

260
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,619
I'll let you get to know each other.

261
00:18:35,637 --> 00:18:39,265
Want a cup of tea? I just put a kettle on.
Take a seat. Go on.

262
00:18:39,809 --> 00:18:41,603
Sit down anywhere you like.

263
00:18:45,538 --> 00:18:47,201
Ey, needs a bit of warming up. So.

264
00:18:48,209 --> 00:18:49,582
What do you think?

265
00:18:50,335 --> 00:18:54,379
Do you think that we look alike?
Me and Reggie?- Oh yes, certainly.

266
00:18:54,571 --> 00:18:58,803
No you don't. You think that he's beautiful
and I've got a face like a gorilla's ass.

267
00:19:00,885 --> 00:19:03,640
No. - It's alright, don't worry about it.
I'm used to it.

268
00:19:03,677 --> 00:19:05,767
<i>Stop doing your hair, right.
Get your stuff out</i>

269
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:07,580
<i>of the car. Do something
fucking useful.</i>

270
00:19:11,315 --> 00:19:12,688
Go on, go away.

271
00:19:17,745 --> 00:19:19,955
I'm a homosexual, Frances.

272
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,824
Well, ya know, I am uh,
y'know... I'm a giver.

273
00:19:25,836 --> 00:19:28,539
Alright? I'm not a receiver.
There is a difference.

274
00:19:28,671 --> 00:19:30,213
I'm not a faggot.

275
00:19:31,422 --> 00:19:34,601
But I do believe that, y'know, you
should not hide what you are.

276
00:19:34,669 --> 00:19:37,270
Ya shouldn't hide what you
are, because it makes

277
00:19:37,282 --> 00:19:39,842
you very... very sad, y'know?
Make you very sad.

278
00:19:40,006 --> 00:19:43,645
Make you very unwell.
I agree completely. Mmm hmm.

279
00:19:44,886 --> 00:19:48,130
You know me and my brother?
We're gonna rule London.

280
00:19:52,169 --> 00:19:55,905
<i>The Kray's main rivals were the
Richardsons of South London.</i>

281
00:19:56,073 --> 00:19:58,023
<i>They were called the Torture Gang.</i>

282
00:19:58,091 --> 00:20:01,134
For the benefit of the jury...

283
00:20:01,526 --> 00:20:05,406
On whose behalf were you operating
on this side of the river?

284
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,209
Come on, Charlie. Please, I'm
begging you... Oh, no no no no.

285
00:20:08,377 --> 00:20:10,775
You do business with the
court as an entity,

286
00:20:10,787 --> 00:20:13,036
therefore address the
court.- What?- What?

287
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:15,415
Your honor.
Fuck!

288
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:19,587
You say 'Your Honor'. By saying Your
Honor, you gain the court's attention...

289
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:22,882
and open up a channel of communication.
A conduit.

290
00:20:22,946 --> 00:20:24,656
So, we'll try again.

291
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:27,692
For the benefit of the
jury: On whose behalf

292
00:20:27,704 --> 00:20:30,361
were you working on
this side of the river?

293
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:32,307
Please, Charlie. I fucking beg you...

294
00:20:32,871 --> 00:20:37,426
Order! Order in this, my court.
Oh, fuck!

295
00:20:40,006 --> 00:20:42,172
You're in Indian Country, old son.

296
00:20:43,482 --> 00:20:46,484
That's what them Cockneys call
south of the river, innit?

297
00:20:47,662 --> 00:20:49,247
Indian Country.

298
00:20:50,532 --> 00:20:55,285
Well? What you doing on my
reservation without my say-so...

299
00:20:55,453 --> 00:20:58,624
filling up your canteen from
my fucking watering hole?

300
00:20:58,788 --> 00:21:00,790
You ain't got the balls to
do that on your own, son.

301
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,490
Who do you work for?
I don't know what you're on about,

302
00:21:02,502 --> 00:21:03,993
Charlie. I don't know what
you're on about... Charlie!

303
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:06,231
Say it. Say the name.
Say it!

304
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:08,579
Buzz him.

305
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:11,826
Objection, Your Honor.
My client is an upstanding citizen.

306
00:21:12,053 --> 00:21:14,347
Objection overruled on
the grounds it's boring.

307
00:21:14,411 --> 00:21:15,780
Oh well, fuck him.

308
00:21:17,381 --> 00:21:21,646
Say it.
Say the Krays, you daft cunt.

309
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:24,484
No, no. No leading the witnesses!

310
00:21:51,222 --> 00:21:52,639
Fuck off!

311
00:21:54,633 --> 00:21:57,259
Alexander might have been
great, but he wasn't Greek.

312
00:21:58,428 --> 00:22:01,175
No?
No, he was a Macedonian.

313
00:22:02,376 --> 00:22:05,145
But he loved them, though.
Aristotle and that lot. He

314
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,937
was deeply impressed by them
flash Hellenistic cunts.

315
00:22:08,105 --> 00:22:10,892
Kristos, get us some more
of that awful Retsina.

316
00:22:21,534 --> 00:22:24,997
Charlie, we've got to fucking sort this.

317
00:22:25,061 --> 00:22:28,981
You're absolutely right.
Kristos, where is my Retsina?

318
00:22:29,249 --> 00:22:32,629
<i>The Richardsons sent George Cornell
to call for a truce.</i>

319
00:22:32,793 --> 00:22:35,403
<i>All they were saying was:
"Give peace a chance".</i>

320
00:22:35,423 --> 00:22:36,925
Fucking Frank 'll 'ing.

321
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,601
Oh, fuck. Are you out of your bravery
jacket? We're here to parlay.

322
00:22:42,386 --> 00:22:44,724
I will fucking map you up, southie.

323
00:22:44,888 --> 00:22:47,683
Oh no, no, Gordon. Let him
in, he's only little.

324
00:22:48,435 --> 00:22:51,146
Things have got out of hand.
Charlie wants to meet.

325
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:55,774
Pig and Whistle. Neutral ground.
Just him, you two and Eddie.

326
00:22:55,942 --> 00:22:58,693
Yup? And how do we know
that we're gonna be safe?

327
00:22:58,861 --> 00:23:03,406
Well... that's a little thing
called trust, ain't it?

328
00:23:03,574 --> 00:23:08,162
Trust, eh? You always got one bloke...
harping on about trust, don't you?

329
00:23:08,326 --> 00:23:10,827
But then ya look over your shoulder, right?
And you see there's

330
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:13,431
another bloke there, right? There
with his hampton in his hand...

331
00:23:13,499 --> 00:23:16,394
and he's preparing to shove
his cock right up your ass.

332
00:23:16,918 --> 00:23:18,712
Well, you wouldn't mind, eh?

333
00:23:20,049 --> 00:23:21,707
You fag puff.

334
00:23:28,976 --> 00:23:32,197
Well, no. No no no no no. Right,
you, get him out of here.

335
00:23:32,209 --> 00:23:35,003
Go on, fuck off. One hour...
and we'll be with ya.

336
00:23:35,072 --> 00:23:38,575
I said bye bye.- Fuck off, John.
There's the door, go on.

337
00:23:38,939 --> 00:23:42,526
Bye bye.- Take that fox with ya, go on.
Get out, ya prick.

338
00:23:43,704 --> 00:23:45,105
A fucking limited.

339
00:23:45,697 --> 00:23:50,494
Hey Charlie, please can I have another egg?
I've eaten this one.

340
00:23:51,078 --> 00:23:52,496
I don't like it, Reggie.

341
00:23:53,369 --> 00:23:57,132
Nah, it's alright. I know
them and I know their pub.

342
00:23:58,125 --> 00:23:59,627
We'll be alright.

343
00:23:59,695 --> 00:24:02,698
Man, you've got to clean that
fucking toilet, mate. It stinks!

344
00:24:02,762 --> 00:24:04,624
Who am I gonna pay to do it?
Some mofo when she

345
00:24:04,636 --> 00:24:06,393
don't? What are you
having to drink?- Ummm...

346
00:24:06,757 --> 00:24:08,259
Forget it, they just walked in.

347
00:24:09,804 --> 00:24:12,044
Hello, mate. Can I get two
Guinnesses, please? Yeah,

348
00:24:12,056 --> 00:24:14,348
hang on a sec, just gotta go
down to change the barrel.

349
00:24:20,856 --> 00:24:26,528
Reg? Ron? The Richardsons were unexpectedly
engaged, so we're gonna look after you.

350
00:24:26,944 --> 00:24:30,404
Oh, it's alright .. yeah, the landlord is
gonna change the barrel for me, thanks.

351
00:24:30,656 --> 00:24:32,449
You don't mind if I pour
myself a pint, yeah?

352
00:24:32,658 --> 00:24:36,385
What is that? Yeah, what you think, puff?
It's a fuckin' tool.

353
00:24:36,453 --> 00:24:40,165
No, it's not. It's a fuckin' rolling pin.
Who are you? Fanny Cradock?

354
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:42,720
What are you doing with that? Are
you going to bake me a cake?

355
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:45,169
Gonna sing me a song and watch
me blow out me fucking candles?

356
00:24:47,003 --> 00:24:53,053
I come here for a fucking shootout, right?
A proper shootout with some proper men.

357
00:24:53,217 --> 00:24:56,640
Like Colonel Custer and Geronimo.
Have you ever heard of them? No.

358
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,352
Because you were too in your penny
baking fucking fairy cakes weren't ya?

359
00:25:01,016 --> 00:25:05,272
Reg, this lot is a bunch of fucking
nonces to a man. They're fucking nonces.

360
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:07,897
Get out of me fucking way.
Go on, get out. Go on,

361
00:25:07,909 --> 00:25:10,233
fuck off. You call yourself
a fucking gangster?

362
00:25:10,578 --> 00:25:13,536
A shootout, right? Is a fucking shootout!

363
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:19,370
Like a Western.

364
00:25:22,288 --> 00:25:28,242
Wankers! Fucking embarrassing. Waste
of my time. Fucking waste of time.

365
00:25:31,297 --> 00:25:33,912
Well, your brother has done a runner.
Nah, he's

366
00:25:33,924 --> 00:25:36,550
just genuinely disappointed
with you, that's all.

367
00:25:38,051 --> 00:25:40,898
Look at that, it's full
of iron, that is. It

368
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:43,641
takes a while, that
does, yeah, to settle.

369
00:25:44,473 --> 00:25:47,644
Well, Charlie Richardson said we're
to knock the granny out of you, Reg.

370
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:50,691
Oh yeah, he did, did he? That's
good of him. Right, listen.

371
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:56,276
When you see him next, you
tell him for me, yeah, that I say:

372
00:25:56,445 --> 00:26:00,072
Fuck Charlie, right? And
fuck his brother, yeah?

373
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,951
And fuck that fat Georgie Cornell
that hangs out with him.

374
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:06,206
Fuck your face, yeah? Yeah?

375
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:09,748
And fuck the fucking lot of you as well.
What do you think of that, ey?

376
00:26:10,082 --> 00:26:11,291
You like that?- mmm.

377
00:26:12,792 --> 00:26:15,871
You won't mind if I fight back, will ya?
If you think you can manage it.

378
00:26:16,255 --> 00:26:18,656
Nah, it's more for me pride,
really, to be honest.

379
00:26:18,668 --> 00:26:20,844
I warn you. I'm not gonna
fight fair, though.

380
00:26:21,052 --> 00:26:23,478
That's why I brought these.
Alright.

381
00:26:24,055 --> 00:26:27,558
Now before we start, I've got a little
joke for you? You're gonna love this one.

382
00:26:28,043 --> 00:26:30,793
Paranoid schizophrenic
who walks into a bar...

383
00:27:01,114 --> 00:27:02,459
You fuckers...

384
00:27:18,114 --> 00:27:21,285
<i>They never stood a chance against
my beautiful Reggie.</i>

385
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:25,990
<i>A gang war seemed certain.
Fucking hell, Ron.</i>

386
00:27:26,029 --> 00:27:30,108
<i>But on the day of the World Cup final,
Scotland Yard had its say as well.</i>

387
00:27:30,934 --> 00:27:33,476
<i>There's Ball, running himself daft.</i>

388
00:27:37,293 --> 00:27:40,251
Goooaaal! Get in there, you cunts!

389
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,903
Police, stay right where you are.
Oh, come on,

390
00:27:43,915 --> 00:27:46,300
boys... not today.
What you mean, no goal?

391
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:48,718
Wait.
Wait wait wait. Wait!

392
00:27:50,176 --> 00:27:54,264
It's a goal. It's a goal! It's
a fucking goal! It's a goal!

393
00:27:59,337 --> 00:28:02,946
<i>Charlie Richardson was
sentenced to 25 years</i>

394
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:05,635
<i>for fraud, extortion and assault.</i>

395
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:10,195
<i>London was an open city
and the Krays moved in.</i>

396
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:21,381
Glad you could come, Mr. De Faye.

397
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:23,199
Mr. Payne.

398
00:28:26,002 --> 00:28:29,381
I'm not often intrigued,
but your message...

399
00:28:30,005 --> 00:28:31,343
it intrigued.- mmmm.

400
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,633
Sit down.

401
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,765
These are the Kray twins.

402
00:28:38,622 --> 00:28:40,599
Ronald and Reginald.

403
00:28:43,979 --> 00:28:48,759
Yes, I've, uh... heard of them.
You'll find them useful friends.

404
00:28:49,107 --> 00:28:52,599
What is this about, Mr. Payne?
This is about a gambling

405
00:28:52,611 --> 00:28:55,572
casino in Knightsbridge
called Esmeralda's Barn.

406
00:28:55,782 --> 00:28:57,700
I'm not familiar with it.
Really?

407
00:28:58,032 --> 00:29:01,014
Well you'll be shocked
to learn that you earned

408
00:29:01,026 --> 00:29:04,082
24,000 pounds from it in
the last three months.

409
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:06,697
My friends and I would
like to purchase it from

410
00:29:06,709 --> 00:29:09,379
you. We have the contract
ready for your signature.

411
00:29:11,713 --> 00:29:15,672
<i>Ruling London involved intelligence
and intimidation.</i>

412
00:29:16,033 --> 00:29:17,310
It's not for sale.

413
00:29:19,096 --> 00:29:23,348
You might find that in the future
there is a less polite approach.

414
00:29:23,372 --> 00:29:26,347
<i>The trick was to cultivate
a quiet certainty that</i>

415
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:29,053
<i>should it be needed violence
was on offer...</i>

416
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:31,780
<i>Yeah...- , and would be happily applied.</i>

417
00:29:32,148 --> 00:29:35,191
<i>Leslie Payne was a fronter and a fixer.</i>

418
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:39,487
<i>Reggie found Payne useful,
but Ron was suspicious of him.</i>

419
00:29:39,655 --> 00:29:43,783
<i>Afraid his scams were the opposite
of what a gangster should be.</i>

420
00:29:43,951 --> 00:29:46,278
Consider Las Vegas.
Right.

421
00:29:46,746 --> 00:29:49,248
It is all legal and all run by the mafia.

422
00:29:49,416 --> 00:29:53,376
Soon, London will be the same. What with
Havana gone, the mafia is moving in.

423
00:29:53,544 --> 00:29:57,813
Meyer Lansky has already made inquiries.
Meyer Lansky? Yeah.

424
00:29:58,673 --> 00:30:00,551
As in the Meyer Lansky?

425
00:30:00,615 --> 00:30:02,300
Meyer Lansky.

426
00:30:03,762 --> 00:30:06,749
What, the Americans gonna try muscling us?
Nah, they don't work that way.

427
00:30:06,773 --> 00:30:10,224
They don't want a war, Ron.
They're businessmen.

428
00:30:10,436 --> 00:30:11,893
Well, maybe I want a war, anyway.

429
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:17,122
Now look, what they do want is to know
who is the up and coming local firm.

430
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:21,746
Cos they will colonize London by financing
that firm and franchising the city.

431
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:25,650
So you have to prove to the Americans
that the Krays are the only gang in town.

432
00:30:25,714 --> 00:30:27,840
Yeah, very fucking interesting.

433
00:30:28,825 --> 00:30:33,236
The world could be our oyster.
Payne. What?

434
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:36,168
You say "our" a lot, right?

435
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:41,798
You say 'our' and you also so 'we' a lot.

436
00:30:42,338 --> 00:30:43,591
Do I?

437
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:47,511
My question is... is your last name Kray?

438
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:54,149
Listen, Ron. You keep the pearls.
I'm perfectly happy with the soft bits.

439
00:30:54,642 --> 00:30:58,189
Yeah, I bet you are. I bet you are.

440
00:30:59,062 --> 00:31:03,843
Reggie, I say it's a very bad idea, this.
It's a bad idea.

441
00:31:03,911 --> 00:31:07,922
I say, right, that we meet these mafioso
scum at London in a pub, right.

442
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:10,677
We pick them up, we chop them up.
We put them in their

443
00:31:10,689 --> 00:31:12,995
fucking luggage and send
em straight home away.

444
00:31:13,996 --> 00:31:15,662
That's the plan.

445
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,184
Well, I'm glad we could have this meeting.

446
00:31:28,138 --> 00:31:31,535
Mr. Lansky has taken an interest
in the Colony Sporting Club.

447
00:31:31,703 --> 00:31:34,147
He has his casino people there right now.

448
00:31:34,415 --> 00:31:40,518
Well, Mr. Lansky might want to know that
we happen to have a casino of our own.

449
00:31:41,007 --> 00:31:43,471
Really? Your own casino?

450
00:31:44,304 --> 00:31:46,527
Well, you see, we own Las Vegas.

451
00:31:48,231 --> 00:31:50,808
But here the Atlantic Ocean is in our way.

452
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:53,600
So Mr. Lansky lacks
the ability to, uh,

453
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:56,577
ensure the physical
security of his property.

454
00:31:56,845 --> 00:32:00,015
From both outside muscle... and the cops.

455
00:32:00,283 --> 00:32:05,448
He thinks the Kray family can help. London
is going to be the Las Vegas of Europe.

456
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:09,354
We need someone to front and
someone to muscle for us.

457
00:32:10,801 --> 00:32:13,918
I mean, y'know, we can do
your security, that's not

458
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:17,059
a problem. Y'know, but we
don't wanna work for ya.

459
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:20,164
We'd much rather that we work with ya.

460
00:32:20,233 --> 00:32:22,563
What Reggie's trying to say...
I think he

461
00:32:22,575 --> 00:32:25,073
knows what he's trying to say.
He just said it.

462
00:32:25,541 --> 00:32:30,417
We're in your backyard.- Yeah.- Mr. Lansky
is open to discussions of this nature.

463
00:32:30,481 --> 00:32:36,042
He sends this as goodwill gesture. Just
a taste. For expenses. Open it, please.

464
00:32:42,653 --> 00:32:48,411
Now, the second briefcase contains business
of my own I need to take care of. Please.

465
00:32:51,484 --> 00:32:54,141
Bearer bonds. Free money.

466
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:58,857
A hundred grand in negotiable bearer
bonds jacked from a bank in Montreal.

467
00:32:59,422 --> 00:33:01,813
Too hot to move in North America.

468
00:33:02,515 --> 00:33:06,742
It's a hundred grand.
Could you guys handle that?

469
00:33:08,637 --> 00:33:10,524
Yeah, we can handle it.

470
00:33:11,241 --> 00:33:13,244
Really? Good.

471
00:33:13,853 --> 00:33:18,846
Boys who jacked it get 20%.
We split the rest 60/40.

472
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:24,038
If this works out, Reggie, I got a two
million dollar backlog of those scharols.

473
00:33:25,742 --> 00:33:28,105
Does that sound like you're
staying out of our way?

474
00:33:31,435 --> 00:33:33,607
50/50, mate.

475
00:33:38,863 --> 00:33:43,011
I like you, Reggie.
50/50 it is. Done.

476
00:33:43,912 --> 00:33:47,418
I'm glad that we could make a
deal.- Yeah.- Now this feels right.

477
00:33:47,586 --> 00:33:50,442
Listen, uh, you come to
Philadelphia anytime...

478
00:33:50,507 --> 00:33:54,512
you see what you want, any size, any
shape, right? We'll get it for ya.

479
00:33:54,581 --> 00:33:57,962
A nice Italian girl. A little
spaghetti and meatballs.

480
00:33:58,356 --> 00:34:00,207
I prefer boys.

481
00:34:02,618 --> 00:34:04,065
Excuse me? I didn't catch that.

482
00:34:04,606 --> 00:34:09,674
I said I prefer boys.
Italians, actually.

483
00:34:10,075 --> 00:34:13,280
Sometimes Greek, but I'm
not prejudiced. No.

484
00:34:13,292 --> 00:34:16,294
Because I happened to
have a Negro, once.

485
00:34:16,758 --> 00:34:21,434
And a Tahitian who I bent up like a
pretzel. I really fucking hurt him.

486
00:34:27,528 --> 00:34:30,486
You've got a lot of fucking
balls to admit that, kid. You

487
00:34:30,498 --> 00:34:33,570
know what, you've got some set
of fucking gestantes on you.

488
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:36,412
You know what I say to that?
Bravo a salute.

489
00:34:36,424 --> 00:34:38,839
C'mon. Salute. Huh?
Am I right, fellas?

490
00:34:39,103 --> 00:34:41,142
What fucking balls. Salute.
Cheers, mate. Cheers.

491
00:34:44,941 --> 00:34:47,978
Well done.
Cheers, mate.

492
00:34:52,301 --> 00:34:55,759
<i>You don't understand.
He's not what you think he is, alright?</i>

493
00:34:55,823 --> 00:34:59,373
<i>He is really sweet
and it is exciting to be with him.</i>

494
00:34:59,537 --> 00:35:02,170
<i>Just because you have a boring life
doesn't mean I have to as well.</i>

495
00:35:02,334 --> 00:35:06,261
<i>If I have a boring life, it's
because I gave up my life for you.</i>

496
00:35:17,696 --> 00:35:20,240
Oh, Frankie, you take my breath away.

497
00:35:21,326 --> 00:35:22,996
You can have mine.

498
00:35:34,015 --> 00:35:36,643
You're a joker. Go on, get in the car.

499
00:35:41,443 --> 00:35:42,777
Hurry up.

500
00:35:45,534 --> 00:35:48,698
<i>Esmeralda's Barn made
money like a dream. Two</i>

501
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:51,143
<i>thousand pounds a week pure profit.</i>

502
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:53,640
<i>There was nothing to do but enjoy it.</i>

503
00:35:54,404 --> 00:35:56,745
<i>Owning that casino meant
everything to Reggie.</i>

504
00:35:57,009 --> 00:35:59,754
<i>He'd finally crossed the
line between the old East</i>

505
00:35:59,766 --> 00:36:02,310
<i>End and the green pastures
of the Golden West.</i>

506
00:36:02,478 --> 00:36:05,066
<i>He was becoming a celebrity himself.</i>

507
00:36:05,175 --> 00:36:07,746
<i>As long as their health
didn't suffer, the high</i>

508
00:36:07,758 --> 00:36:10,183
<i>rollers loved rubbing elbows
with gangsters.</i>

509
00:36:11,693 --> 00:36:14,582
<i>Aristocrats and criminals
have a lot in common.</i>

510
00:36:14,747 --> 00:36:17,986
<i>They're both selfish, get
bored easily...</i>

511
00:36:18,088 --> 00:36:21,834
<i>and have access to wads of cash they
didn't have to work honestly to get.</i>

512
00:36:22,552 --> 00:36:27,560
<i>The topper? Neither have any interest
in bourgeois rules or morality.</i>

513
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:31,066
<i>Put it all together
with a roulette wheel .</i>

514
00:36:31,078 --> 00:36:33,077
<i>A stunning recipe for success.</i>

515
00:36:35,325 --> 00:36:37,328
<i>Ron was the odd man out.</i>

516
00:36:37,492 --> 00:36:40,790
<i>His pills stabilized him,
but they'd never cure him.</i>

517
00:36:40,958 --> 00:36:42,769
<i>Clubland held little charm...</i>

518
00:36:42,837 --> 00:36:46,559
<i>and he yearned for Reggie
and the dark side of gangland.</i>

519
00:36:46,627 --> 00:36:50,634
As soon as you turn your back...

520
00:36:51,768 --> 00:36:55,398
life plays dirty tricks on ya, y'know?

521
00:37:14,097 --> 00:37:16,810
<i>We wouldn't spend Christmas
together that year.</i>

522
00:37:17,687 --> 00:37:19,983
<i>There was an old warrant on Reggie.</i>

523
00:37:20,147 --> 00:37:24,290
<i>The last six months of his sentence was
on appeal, but it was denied.</i>

524
00:37:24,663 --> 00:37:26,866
<i>He was to surrender in the morning.</i>

525
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:31,334
<i>My real life was about to begin.</i>

526
00:38:22,086 --> 00:38:23,505
See you in a bit.

527
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:27,051
See ya later, Reg.
So long, Reg.

528
00:38:33,393 --> 00:38:34,595
Frank.

529
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:40,403
Will you look after your sister while
I'm away? I will, Reg. Yeah?- Yeah.

530
00:38:41,242 --> 00:38:42,492
Good lad.

531
00:39:08,788 --> 00:39:10,206
Move it, Kray.

532
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:12,670
Stop on the line.

533
00:39:14,505 --> 00:39:16,216
You're nothing in here.

534
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,554
Fuck him.

535
00:39:20,347 --> 00:39:21,557
Fuck him up.

536
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:28,276
<i>Leave him alone, Gibbsy.
Bury him, Reggie .</i>

537
00:39:28,653 --> 00:39:30,572
Shut up, all of ya.

538
00:39:32,304 --> 00:39:34,831
<i>Come on, Reg.
Don't let them do you like this .</i>

539
00:39:34,996 --> 00:39:37,110
You're not so tough now, are ya, eh?

540
00:39:38,794 --> 00:39:41,599
<i>Give that bastard some back.</i>

541
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,182
You're nothing in here.

542
00:39:47,601 --> 00:39:50,021
Nothing. - please, no more, governor.
No more, please.

543
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:53,663
That's more like it, Reggie.
Please?

544
00:39:55,029 --> 00:39:58,535
A little respect doesn't hurt, does it?

545
00:39:59,372 --> 00:40:00,875
No more.

546
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,543
I have shit bigger turds.

547
00:40:04,172 --> 00:40:07,193
Please, water.
You want some water?

548
00:40:07,261 --> 00:40:10,523
Look at that, gents. He's only
begging for water. Fuck off, PT

549
00:40:10,891 --> 00:40:14,572
What do you think of him now, your
famous Reggie fucking Kray? Fuck you!

550
00:40:14,862 --> 00:40:19,490
Begging for fucking water.
What has he come to.

551
00:40:19,654 --> 00:40:24,831
Here you are, Reg. Now don't spill it.
Cos you've had a little tumble, ain't ya?

552
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,335
Hey?

553
00:40:29,546 --> 00:40:31,425
Good boy.

554
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:34,468
Water?- Look.- Fucking cockhead.
Fuck off.- Look who

555
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,260
it is. Reggie Kray, begging
for fucking... water.

556
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:55,960
Reggie... Reggie... Reggie

557
00:41:04,937 --> 00:41:06,524
Hello, Frances.

558
00:41:07,193 --> 00:41:09,837
Hello, Ron.
I've saw Reg today.

559
00:41:09,905 --> 00:41:12,103
He sends his best. He
says it's probably best

560
00:41:12,115 --> 00:41:14,373
that you don't go visit
him this year, alright?

561
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:17,750
Did he say why?
No, he didn't mention it.

562
00:41:20,591 --> 00:41:23,306
Did you know that it is
possible, right, for a

563
00:41:23,318 --> 00:41:26,393
person to become a ghost
while they're still alive?

564
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:28,853
Do you think so?

565
00:41:29,398 --> 00:41:31,481
Well it's happened to you, innit?

566
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:41,050
No no no, listen.
No, what?

567
00:41:41,118 --> 00:41:43,878
No no no, please please please.
Just for a moment. Just listen.

568
00:41:43,946 --> 00:41:48,261
Gambling clubs are legally obliged
to pay winnings on the spot.

569
00:41:48,329 --> 00:41:50,369
And that is why we insist
our gamblers pay their

570
00:41:50,381 --> 00:41:52,224
debts on the spot as well.
It's very simple.

571
00:41:52,292 --> 00:41:55,223
Yes, I know. I've heard
you, but that's your

572
00:41:55,235 --> 00:41:58,570
problem, right? That's
your problem and not mine.

573
00:41:58,735 --> 00:42:01,808
Mine is that I want fifty thousand pounds.

574
00:42:01,838 --> 00:42:05,139
Oh, here you go again with your fifty
thousand pounds to go to Nigeria.

575
00:42:05,165 --> 00:42:10,422
It is not just to go to Nigeria, is it?
I want to set up a company.

576
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:15,014
Right? I want to build a city
in Nigeria for the children.

577
00:42:15,222 --> 00:42:18,945
Near Enugu.
Enugu. Yes, Enugu.

578
00:42:19,113 --> 00:42:23,544
Yes, Enugu. I told you, Enugu, right?
You don't know everything, do you, Payne?

579
00:42:23,577 --> 00:42:27,019
Did you know that "Enugu"
is the African word for 'Utopia'?

580
00:42:27,058 --> 00:42:28,344
No.
No you did not.

581
00:42:28,366 --> 00:42:31,619
Did you know that 'Utopia' is
the Greek word for 'nowhere'?

582
00:42:31,834 --> 00:42:34,839
For fifty thousand pounds I
can make that 'somewhere'.

583
00:42:34,907 --> 00:42:39,222
I can turn it into a place where people
will smile at me and children will dance.

584
00:42:39,286 --> 00:42:41,490
I will smile for you, Ron.

585
00:42:41,558 --> 00:42:45,934
I will smile for you if you tell me
where I can get fifty thousand pounds.

586
00:42:45,955 --> 00:42:49,312
I'm telling you, I'm fucking telling
you... just put it out of the casino.

587
00:42:49,363 --> 00:42:51,398
I cannot put it out of the
casino that's what I'm

588
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:53,293
saying.
Put it out of the casino, you cunt.

589
00:42:53,361 --> 00:42:55,818
Despite the temptation. Do
not meddle with a foolproof

590
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:58,254
way of making the money.
I am not a fucking banker.

591
00:42:58,418 --> 00:43:01,570
No no no!- I am not a fucking banker.
Great! Genius.

592
00:43:01,582 --> 00:43:04,689
Look at that. That has made
it all the more mendable.

593
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,697
This is a man who wants to build a city.
Don't you fucking threaten me, you cunt.

594
00:43:07,722 --> 00:43:10,859
Don't you fucking dare
talk to me like that, you cunt.

595
00:43:12,149 --> 00:43:15,991
Reggie is not here now, alright?
He's fucking gone, isn't he?

596
00:43:16,055 --> 00:43:18,980
So you work for me, Ron Kray.

597
00:43:19,144 --> 00:43:22,222
So you will trotter on
down to the fucking bank

598
00:43:22,234 --> 00:43:25,324
and you will fetch me my
fifty thousand pounds.

599
00:43:25,363 --> 00:43:27,995
Yeah, I'll go to the bank and have a
little talk to them and see what I can do.

600
00:43:28,259 --> 00:43:30,992
And I'll tell you. I
may work for you, Ron,

601
00:43:31,004 --> 00:43:33,937
but I'm certainly not
afraid of you, alright?

602
00:43:35,187 --> 00:43:38,192
Well that is fucking stupid as well,
because you fucking should be.

603
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:42,307
Because if my brother hadn't of vouched
for you, you'd be fucking dead.

604
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:12,056
What happened?

605
00:44:12,594 --> 00:44:16,224
What are you doing here? Didn't
Ronnie tell you not to come?

606
00:44:18,844 --> 00:44:20,098
I missed you.
Yeah.

607
00:44:22,041 --> 00:44:24,938
Frankie, I don't want you to come here
and see me like this. Do you understand?

608
00:44:25,314 --> 00:44:27,402
Who did it?
What?

609
00:44:27,566 --> 00:44:30,487
Your face.
Was it one of the other prisoners?

610
00:44:30,555 --> 00:44:34,313
No. No, it was one of the guards, alright?

611
00:44:34,578 --> 00:44:36,541
Have you reported them?
No.

612
00:44:36,709 --> 00:44:39,961
But y'know what? When I get out, I'm thinking,
right, I might roll down to the ol' houses

613
00:44:39,973 --> 00:44:43,092
of parliment and have a word with the prime
minister. Because he will listen. He will.

614
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:47,014
Frankie, this is prison.
OK? That's what it is, is.

615
00:44:47,227 --> 00:44:49,186
The law of the jungle in here.

616
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:51,762
But don't worry about it because
I'm a big boy and I can

617
00:44:51,774 --> 00:44:54,110
look after meself. And I'll
be out very soon, alright?

618
00:44:54,411 --> 00:44:58,409
Go on and look at that lump over there.
You see him? With the big hat.

619
00:44:58,478 --> 00:45:04,336
There's a very good reason why we
all call him handbag. Alright?

620
00:45:08,218 --> 00:45:09,844
I don't want a life like this.

621
00:45:11,768 --> 00:45:15,730
Just waiting for you while you're
in prison. I know. I know, right.

622
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:22,200
Frankie, it won't happen again.

623
00:45:22,449 --> 00:45:24,329
How can you be sure?
Because I know.

624
00:45:24,349 --> 00:45:28,295
Because I promise you that it won't happen again. Alright?

625
00:45:29,638 --> 00:45:32,618
I know how you can know be sure.
Go on.

626
00:45:32,727 --> 00:45:34,313
You could go straight.

627
00:45:35,147 --> 00:45:39,194
Be a casino owner. Club owner.
You enjoy it.

628
00:45:39,562 --> 00:45:41,148
Just forget everything else.

629
00:45:41,297 --> 00:45:45,889
It really is that simple for you, innit?
Just "go straight?"

630
00:45:48,253 --> 00:45:51,967
Babe, Life isn't always the
way we want it to be, y'know?

631
00:45:52,035 --> 00:45:55,488
Life has other plans. It's
the way it is, it's life.

632
00:45:55,522 --> 00:45:56,772
I love you.

633
00:45:59,435 --> 00:46:01,014
I love you.

634
00:46:04,612 --> 00:46:07,718
I've never loved anybody before,
but I love you, Reggie.

635
00:46:11,499 --> 00:46:12,749
And I love you too.

636
00:46:18,968 --> 00:46:22,758
Do you think it can protect people?
What?

637
00:46:23,267 --> 00:46:24,477
Love.

638
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:30,863
I like him. Yeah, he's got
something about him, doesn't he?

639
00:46:31,032 --> 00:46:32,350
You know what I reckon it is?

640
00:46:32,375 --> 00:46:34,237
- What? I think it's his hips.
- Yeah.

641
00:46:34,686 --> 00:46:37,711
I want to blow the soul out of that horn.

642
00:46:39,037 --> 00:46:40,988
You feeling a bit horny, are you, Ron?

643
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:44,723
I am. I am.

644
00:46:45,363 --> 00:46:49,310
Go on, do it. I will. Do it. I want
to blow the soul out of that horn.

645
00:46:49,678 --> 00:46:51,734
I am going to do it.
Bugger you, Tiger.

646
00:47:04,743 --> 00:47:07,332
That's it, Ron. Give it a fucking blow.

647
00:47:17,649 --> 00:47:19,128
Kill it.

648
00:47:27,149 --> 00:47:29,442
Oh, fucking hell. Right.

649
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:35,194
Hello? Hello?
Yes, Ron, Hello.

650
00:47:35,263 --> 00:47:38,392
You know when I plan
to die?

651
00:47:38,768 --> 00:47:40,086
When, Ron?

652
00:47:40,523 --> 00:47:42,242
In the very last minute.

653
00:47:44,029 --> 00:47:47,074
Don't fucking encourage
him, for fuck's sake.

654
00:47:48,685 --> 00:47:51,598
Look at you, you flash fuckers, alright?

655
00:47:53,477 --> 00:47:59,587
Now I may not be very good,
right, but a good gangster?

656
00:48:00,056 --> 00:48:05,857
Oh yeah. I'll fucking claim that title.
And how many titles could you claim? Hey?

657
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:11,195
Superficial light.
Oh yeah?

658
00:48:11,992 --> 00:48:15,081
Dripping in your synthetic opulates.

659
00:48:16,625 --> 00:48:21,592
Ha. It's disgusting, really it is.
Yeah.

660
00:48:21,924 --> 00:48:25,591
Right. A bit of magic. You love magic,
don't you? All kids love magic.

661
00:48:27,101 --> 00:48:32,642
You might all be aware that there are
three magic 'C's in the word Carpacia.

662
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:36,564
But how many C's...

663
00:48:37,999 --> 00:48:40,788
are there in the word cunt?

664
00:48:43,708 --> 00:48:45,840
Just you.

665
00:49:11,006 --> 00:49:12,307
You're free.

666
00:49:13,326 --> 00:49:15,961
What are you doing throwing
stones at the window?

667
00:49:15,973 --> 00:49:18,567
They're not stones. These
are Lemon Sherberts.

668
00:49:18,735 --> 00:49:19,961
Here you go.

669
00:49:21,022 --> 00:49:22,665
Oh, well played!

670
00:49:23,287 --> 00:49:27,740
Why don't you ring the bell?
Well, your mum. I mean.

671
00:49:28,125 --> 00:49:30,117
I'm not being funny here,
but the thought of your

672
00:49:30,129 --> 00:49:31,973
mum answering that door
is a bit shocking, so.

673
00:49:32,442 --> 00:49:34,445
I thought she'd give me grief
on account of where I've been.

674
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:38,583
You mean prison?
Yeah, prison. You look beautiful.

675
00:49:39,145 --> 00:49:40,479
You look beautiful too.

676
00:49:41,148 --> 00:49:45,532
I know it's a bit late, alright,
but I've got your Christmas present here.

677
00:49:45,796 --> 00:49:47,759
Do you want me to throw it up?
No.

678
00:49:48,376 --> 00:49:51,506
Well, do you want me to deliver it?
I ain't going through that door.

679
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:53,400
Alright.

680
00:49:56,373 --> 00:49:57,583
You cheeky bugger.

681
00:50:02,183 --> 00:50:03,425
Be careful.

682
00:50:05,204 --> 00:50:07,332
Bit late now, innit?

683
00:50:08,664 --> 00:50:12,084
Right. Your flowers.
Thank you.

684
00:50:13,158 --> 00:50:14,372
And...

685
00:50:16,147 --> 00:50:17,926
your Christmas present.

686
00:50:18,667 --> 00:50:20,070
Sorry it's late.

687
00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:24,512
Go on. Open it.

688
00:50:28,519 --> 00:50:30,687
Frances Shea, will you marry me?

689
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:36,849
We live free and above board?

690
00:50:38,884 --> 00:50:40,271
On my honor.

691
00:50:43,528 --> 00:50:46,157
Yes, Reggie Kray, I will marry you.

692
00:50:53,745 --> 00:50:55,048
That weren't mine!

693
00:50:56,849 --> 00:50:58,144
Cheeky.

694
00:51:02,613 --> 00:51:04,090
Bastard!

695
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:08,933
C'mon, show us your fucking hoochie!
Give us a fucking

696
00:51:08,945 --> 00:51:11,582
look.- You're not listening.
You're not listening.

697
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:16,134
All I'm saying... All I'm saying
is crime is still a business.

698
00:51:16,155 --> 00:51:20,119
You need a public relations department
and we've got Joseph Goebbels.

699
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:21,375
Is he the fat one?

700
00:51:21,692 --> 00:51:24,779
You read lips.
What's he saying? What's he saying, Les?

701
00:51:24,943 --> 00:51:29,948
Oh, stroke him off. I think he's saying
something about Gobbles... or nobles

702
00:51:31,493 --> 00:51:32,870
That's very strange.

703
00:51:34,288 --> 00:51:36,374
He ain't happy.
You'll see.

704
00:51:42,167 --> 00:51:43,669
Nice, innit?

705
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:50,396
Oh, he looks lovely, Ron. Yeah, he's put
on a little bit of "timboo", innit he?

706
00:51:51,176 --> 00:51:53,471
He's going to be very, very upset.

707
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:55,609
Did I miss something?

708
00:51:57,226 --> 00:52:01,270
Is this not... this is Friday night, right?
Well, I tried to tell you.

709
00:52:01,438 --> 00:52:03,037
Yeah, but it's Friday
night, right? You

710
00:52:03,049 --> 00:52:04,902
didn't tell me that it
was this bad, did you?

711
00:52:05,066 --> 00:52:07,804
It's Ron, innit? He's run the
place into the ground. He's

712
00:52:07,816 --> 00:52:10,423
turned a straight money
earner into a financial wreck

713
00:52:10,444 --> 00:52:12,714
And I'll tell you one other thing...
this place

714
00:52:12,726 --> 00:52:14,868
will crash when we get
our tax bill next week.

715
00:52:14,976 --> 00:52:17,078
What's he saying?
Go on, what's he saying?

716
00:52:17,746 --> 00:52:22,167
He's just told him that you're missing
tax payments. The silly cunt.

717
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:27,588
Let's go.

718
00:52:28,505 --> 00:52:30,583
Right, listen. It's still an
honest business, you understand?

719
00:52:31,352 --> 00:52:33,009
How very rude.

720
00:52:34,471 --> 00:52:39,808
Hey! Where are you going?
This is fucking criminal mate

721
00:52:42,086 --> 00:52:43,980
Hey! Where are you going?

722
00:52:47,651 --> 00:52:50,987
Oh, there he is. My
beautiful brother, Reggie.

723
00:52:51,155 --> 00:52:53,533
A toast to my beautiful brother.

724
00:52:53,557 --> 00:52:58,033
Home at last, like Agamemnon returned
to Ithaca.

725
00:52:58,326 --> 00:53:04,376
And beautiful Frances, where have you been?
It's as if you've returned from the dead.

726
00:53:04,668 --> 00:53:07,502
What are you doing, mate?
What are you fucking playing at? Hey?

727
00:53:07,879 --> 00:53:09,749
I'm not playing at anything, am I?
It's you. You

728
00:53:09,761 --> 00:53:11,567
come in here, You don't
even say "Hello, Ron."

729
00:53:11,631 --> 00:53:13,865
You don't even have a drink.
You just bugger off. What's

730
00:53:13,877 --> 00:53:15,887
that about?
All right. Hello, Ron. Cheers, mate.

731
00:53:16,051 --> 00:53:18,037
Fuck you!
What are you shouting at me, for?

732
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:20,283
Because you, right? You had the
world on a string, yeah...

733
00:53:20,347 --> 00:53:23,177
but you couldn't hold it
together, so you fucked it up.

734
00:53:23,350 --> 00:53:24,619
Don't... uh, listen, you was away.

735
00:53:24,687 --> 00:53:27,270
I was in prison. I was in prison!
So I had to make do with what I had.

736
00:53:27,606 --> 00:53:29,608
Are you going Ron or Reg?

737
00:53:30,902 --> 00:53:32,403
Score?
Mmm hmm.

738
00:53:33,236 --> 00:53:36,255
Reginald. He'll never go
down in front of the missus.

739
00:53:36,323 --> 00:53:38,665
You had everything, mate. You had it all.
You are... I didn't have you, right.

740
00:53:38,733 --> 00:53:42,261
Unbelievable.- Reggie.- It's all
right, honestly. I've got this. It's fine.

741
00:53:42,329 --> 00:53:44,434
Yeah, actually, he's got this.
Thank you very much. He's

742
00:53:44,446 --> 00:53:46,525
a big boy. We're talking about
earning a living. Y'know?

743
00:53:46,589 --> 00:53:48,833
We're talking about being
gangsters, right, which

744
00:53:48,845 --> 00:53:50,921
is what we are. So you
can just fuck off...

745
00:53:50,985 --> 00:53:52,230
Go on.
Don't.

746
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:56,715
Y'know, one of these days, Ron Kray, your
miserable life will swallow you whole.

747
00:53:57,383 --> 00:53:59,398
Yeah, well you should know all
about it, actually, y'know,

748
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:01,403
because I have heard all the stories.
They're not good...

749
00:54:01,431 --> 00:54:03,491
Your mum did palm us off
with the damaged goods,

750
00:54:03,503 --> 00:54:05,828
didn't she? And you're very,
very damaged, aren't you?

751
00:54:05,892 --> 00:54:08,916
Alright, just get in the car. Don't you
ever speak to Frances like that again.

752
00:54:08,947 --> 00:54:11,274
That's right, Frances. Blood
is thicker than water,

753
00:54:11,286 --> 00:54:13,491
y'know? And I've been with
Reggie since the womb.

754
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:16,838
Ron, shut up. I want you to apologize to
Frances right now.

755
00:54:16,987 --> 00:54:21,115
Right... right. All right, Frances.

756
00:54:21,783 --> 00:54:23,661
I'm sorry, alright?

757
00:54:23,825 --> 00:54:29,166
Yes. I'm truly very sorry. The club is
very, very empty. A bit like you, really.

758
00:54:29,231 --> 00:54:32,054
There is fuck all in it,
apart my brother's cock.

759
00:54:50,479 --> 00:54:54,275
You, alright, are a fucking disgrace, mate.

760
00:54:57,070 --> 00:54:58,987
You hit me.

761
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:00,487
Yeah.

762
00:55:04,372 --> 00:55:04,917
No...

763
00:55:05,912 --> 00:55:06,597
No...

764
00:55:06,702 --> 00:55:07,997
No...

765
00:55:08,097 --> 00:55:09,097
No, Ron.

766
00:55:10,097 --> 00:55:13,097
No... no.

767
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:16,569
Now you've done it, you fucking cunt.

768
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:21,465
Fucking cunt.

769
00:55:24,796 --> 00:55:26,807
For fuck's sake. Not the bottle.
Not the bottle, you...

770
00:55:31,683 --> 00:55:34,106
No! Not the balls.

771
00:55:36,795 --> 00:55:38,049
Fucking cunt! Wanker!

772
00:55:41,693 --> 00:55:43,739
Sweetheart, please leave.

773
00:55:44,572 --> 00:55:46,525
Fucking... Fucking cunt!

774
00:55:57,302 --> 00:55:58,630
Give me that.

775
00:56:02,758 --> 00:56:06,385
Never mess with a man's jewels, mate.

776
00:56:09,356 --> 00:56:10,916
Now, what are you doing?
No, Ron. No, no. No,

777
00:56:10,928 --> 00:56:12,431
no. That is a bottle, Ron.
That bottle...

778
00:56:23,778 --> 00:56:27,238
I'm gonna split 'em up. Just a minute,
you fucking sit down, you shit.

779
00:56:27,874 --> 00:56:31,370
They're family. Save it. Get
out of the fucking way.

780
00:56:33,287 --> 00:56:37,488
Put it down.
It's gone too far.

781
00:56:38,084 --> 00:56:42,088
Now, I told you.
Now, c'mon, that's enough.

782
00:56:46,092 --> 00:56:47,385
No.

783
00:56:49,402 --> 00:56:50,405
No.

784
00:56:52,098 --> 00:56:53,932
Enough, Reg, mate.

785
00:56:54,432 --> 00:56:57,642
You just don't understand.
Fuh... Fuck.

786
00:56:58,977 --> 00:57:01,835
You don't understand me.
Well, that's probably because

787
00:57:01,847 --> 00:57:04,566
I don't want to fucking
understand you right now Ron.

788
00:57:04,634 --> 00:57:10,888
I just wanted to just, y'know...
There's no point in fucking explaining.

789
00:57:12,117 --> 00:57:17,615
It's fucking hopeless. Go on. Help me up.
Help me up. That really fucking hurt.

790
00:57:18,579 --> 00:57:20,958
What are you doing? For fuck's sake, Ron.

791
00:57:21,026 --> 00:57:26,839
What I'm trying to tell you is
very simple, right? Listen.

792
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:30,259
I am very, very...

793
00:57:31,176 --> 00:57:34,723
very fragile myself, alright?

794
00:57:34,888 --> 00:57:36,405
Yup, fragile, I've got it.

795
00:57:36,974 --> 00:57:39,300
Very fragile.
I've got it!

796
00:57:48,693 --> 00:57:50,154
Alright, c'mon now, for fuck's sake.

797
00:57:50,303 --> 00:57:53,065
I'm not myself.

798
00:57:53,165 --> 00:57:55,115
This isn't me, is it?

799
00:57:55,283 --> 00:57:58,246
This isn't us. None of this is us.

800
00:58:00,497 --> 00:58:02,751
I am very sorry.
It's OK.

801
00:58:03,399 --> 00:58:04,585
Are you done?

802
00:58:05,541 --> 00:58:07,043
Is she gone?

803
00:58:07,211 --> 00:58:08,504
Yes, she's gone.

804
00:58:08,673 --> 00:58:09,922
She's a keeper.

805
00:58:10,090 --> 00:58:12,340
Gee, thanks, Ron.
Thanks.

806
00:58:24,144 --> 00:58:26,774
There she is.
Yup, I've got her.

807
00:58:26,938 --> 00:58:28,608
Alright, stop here.

808
00:58:29,941 --> 00:58:32,067
That girl's gonna be the death of me.

809
00:58:32,235 --> 00:58:33,613
Go on, there ya go.

810
00:58:34,197 --> 00:58:37,156
Frankie. Frank.
Excuse me, sorry.

811
00:58:37,324 --> 00:58:41,169
I need to have a word with you about
something. I don't care if you forget me.

812
00:58:41,189 --> 00:58:42,830
Don't say that.
It's true.

813
00:58:42,998 --> 00:58:45,984
You don't mean it. Don't tell me
what I mean. I know what I mean.

814
00:58:46,125 --> 00:58:48,335
Come on... Come on, Frances.
Can't we just start again?

815
00:58:48,503 --> 00:58:50,337
Right? From the beginning,
y'know, right? We can

816
00:58:50,349 --> 00:58:52,007
get rid of everything
that's bad, right...

817
00:58:52,171 --> 00:58:53,756
and we'll just keep everything that's good.

818
00:58:54,465 --> 00:58:57,720
What about Ron?
What about Ron?

819
00:58:58,261 --> 00:59:00,528
Well he's not exactly a good bit, is he?
Well,

820
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:02,725
eh, I mean he's not exactly
a bad bit, either.

821
00:59:02,889 --> 00:59:04,629
Y'know?- He was awful to me yesterday.
Yeah,

822
00:59:04,641 --> 00:59:06,393
yeah he was, but y'know that's...
that's Ron.

823
00:59:06,561 --> 00:59:11,318
If he don't take his tablets, he is,
he is, he's like, he is a nightmare.

824
00:59:11,982 --> 00:59:14,084
He is not always like that, y'know?
He's got a heart of gold.

825
00:59:14,152 --> 00:59:15,902
He loves you bits, he
thinks the world of you.

826
00:59:16,070 --> 00:59:17,780
Honestly, when you left, he was in pieces.

827
00:59:17,948 --> 00:59:20,158
He was like: "Where did she go?"
I said, "She's left."

828
00:59:20,326 --> 00:59:22,785
"Well you better get
after here, cos she's a keeper."

829
00:59:23,329 --> 00:59:26,833
You are a keeper. So he's right. He said
Tell her I'm very sorry.

830
00:59:27,041 --> 00:59:28,498
He is sorry, and I'm sorry.

831
00:59:28,667 --> 00:59:30,416
We're all sorry.
But you know what?

832
00:59:30,753 --> 00:59:33,503
That's what happens sometimes.
Families are stupid, aren't they?

833
00:59:33,671 --> 00:59:35,757
They fight... they make up...

834
00:59:35,922 --> 00:59:39,593
they... they... they stick together
because they love each other.

835
00:59:39,801 --> 00:59:41,303
That's what they do.

836
00:59:43,305 --> 00:59:44,712
Don't tell me about
forgetting you, alright,

837
00:59:44,724 --> 00:59:45,891
because that ain't
happening either.

838
00:59:46,059 --> 00:59:48,186
Y'know, I spent the last six months
thinking about nothing but you.

839
00:59:48,354 --> 00:59:50,604
So I get out and the club's got me a...
Alright.

840
00:59:51,645 --> 00:59:52,982
I'm sorry.

841
00:59:53,523 --> 00:59:54,708
Alright.

842
00:59:54,776 --> 00:59:59,364
<i>It was time for the Krays to enter the
secret history of the 1960's.</i>

843
01:00:03,569 --> 01:00:05,030
<i>As absurd as it seems...</i>

844
01:00:05,199 --> 01:00:09,827
<i>it grew out of Ron's nutter dream of
building a utopian city in Nigeria.</i>

845
01:00:11,368 --> 01:00:13,538
Some are born to be Ronnie Kray...

846
01:00:14,287 --> 01:00:17,919
and some have Ronnie Kray thrust upon them.

847
01:00:19,876 --> 01:00:23,172
<i>Lord Boothby was a distinguished
member of the House of Lords.</i>

848
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:25,634
Ronnie.
Yes?

849
01:00:25,798 --> 01:00:28,721
I regret that my answer is no.

850
01:00:29,261 --> 01:00:32,472
Nigeria is simply too far away...

851
01:00:32,641 --> 01:00:37,061
and I never involve myself in a
thing I can't control personally.

852
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:39,811
I'm so sorry.

853
01:00:43,191 --> 01:00:45,317
He's really lovely, isn't he?

854
01:00:47,363 --> 01:00:49,448
I take it you like ice
and a slice, my lord?

855
01:00:49,613 --> 01:00:51,783
Ice and a slice.

856
01:00:52,199 --> 01:00:53,492
Please, Teddy bear.

857
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:55,995
And don't spare the horses.

858
01:00:58,205 --> 01:01:02,084
Do you know where I hear that lemons
are particularly lovely and fresh?

859
01:01:02,877 --> 01:01:04,379
No, where?

860
01:01:04,543 --> 01:01:06,673
Enugu... Nigeria.

861
01:01:06,837 --> 01:01:09,007
You're very well informed, Teddy.

862
01:01:09,592 --> 01:01:11,593
Very well informed.

863
01:01:12,302 --> 01:01:13,764
Down the hatch.

864
01:01:14,889 --> 01:01:17,347
Do you like it down the hatch, Teddy?

865
01:01:18,392 --> 01:01:21,227
Boothby declined,
but friendship ensued.

866
01:01:21,435 --> 01:01:24,690
And the perverted Peer was soon a guest
at Ron's flat.

867
01:01:24,854 --> 01:01:27,777
The ripples would spread far and wide.

868
01:01:28,149 --> 01:01:30,235
Do call me later, Tom.

869
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:32,613
Harry, all alone?

870
01:01:32,782 --> 01:01:35,364
No need to be. There is
plenty of fruit on the tree.

871
01:01:35,532 --> 01:01:39,076
Tom, not in the House of Commons tonight?

872
01:01:39,744 --> 01:01:41,162
Yeah.

873
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:43,580
Fucking look at me, you cunt.

874
01:01:44,292 --> 01:01:45,474
Yeah?

875
01:01:46,543 --> 01:01:49,005
Go on. Fucking look at him now.

876
01:01:49,798 --> 01:01:51,463
Fucking look at me.

877
01:01:53,341 --> 01:01:55,551
Look at me.

878
01:01:59,263 --> 01:02:01,641
Good lord, that's Bob Boothby.

879
01:02:01,933 --> 01:02:03,311
Yes, Prime Minister, sir.

880
01:02:03,475 --> 01:02:04,892
At an orgy!

881
01:02:05,685 --> 01:02:08,439
The tories are going to have
trouble explaining this.

882
01:02:11,526 --> 01:02:12,775
Here, sir.

883
01:02:15,738 --> 01:02:17,156
Is that Tom Driberg?

884
01:02:17,324 --> 01:02:18,573
In fact, yes, sir.

885
01:02:18,741 --> 01:02:22,493
There is no moral advantage to my party
if my party are also involved.

886
01:02:22,661 --> 01:02:24,411
It gets a bit stickier, sir.

887
01:02:24,579 --> 01:02:26,120
Where were these photos taken?

888
01:02:26,288 --> 01:02:27,541
Cazenove Road, Hackney.

889
01:02:27,914 --> 01:02:29,452
What in god's boots
were they doing in

890
01:02:29,464 --> 01:02:31,253
Hackney?
Well that's where it gets sticky.

891
01:02:31,417 --> 01:02:34,048
I thought the orgy was the sticky bit...
it gets stickier still?

892
01:02:34,212 --> 01:02:37,215
We've had two brothers,
gangsters, under surveillance.

893
01:02:37,383 --> 01:02:38,844
The Krays.

894
01:02:39,008 --> 01:02:41,763
The photographs were taken
in Ronald Kray's flat.

895
01:02:42,348 --> 01:02:46,307
Orgies aside, we're tracking
fraud, protection rackets...

896
01:02:46,475 --> 01:02:49,270
And the American mafia
might also be involved.

897
01:02:50,395 --> 01:02:52,898
London's bottom had reached her top.

898
01:02:53,066 --> 01:02:54,359
Scandal loomed.

899
01:02:54,523 --> 01:02:56,609
The elections are in ten weeks.

900
01:02:56,777 --> 01:02:59,099
They'll vote out both sides of the house.

901
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:01,366
What exactly are you doing about it?

902
01:03:01,530 --> 01:03:03,075
Bugger all, by the looks of it.

903
01:03:06,286 --> 01:03:07,788
Is that Italian?

904
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:09,289
I don't know.

905
01:03:09,453 --> 01:03:10,955
Is it a Daimler?

906
01:03:12,832 --> 01:03:14,458
It's nice, that is.

907
01:03:14,626 --> 01:03:16,380
Oh, what do you want for Christmas?

908
01:03:18,005 --> 01:03:19,733
Umm, I don't know. You
don't have to get me

909
01:03:19,745 --> 01:03:21,801
anything.- Ey?- You don't
have to get me a present.

910
01:03:21,965 --> 01:03:24,928
Oh, that is ridiculous.
Not get you anything for Christmas?

911
01:03:25,096 --> 01:03:27,470
Alright, well you surprise me then.
I'll give you a sack of coal.

912
01:03:27,638 --> 01:03:30,017
I'll get you a sockful of coal.
Lucky thing.

913
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:31,682
Well, what about that?

914
01:03:32,143 --> 01:03:33,476
What about it?

915
01:03:33,644 --> 01:03:34,745
For Christmas.

916
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:37,187
For me?

917
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,109
That's going to be my club.

918
01:03:39,273 --> 01:03:41,111
Is it?
Yeah.

919
01:03:41,944 --> 01:03:44,655
West End, a touch of class.

920
01:03:45,948 --> 01:03:48,034
That is our ticket out of here.

921
01:03:51,285 --> 01:03:52,702
It's snowing.

922
01:03:54,018 --> 01:03:55,019
Yeah.

923
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:57,351
Gone.

924
01:03:59,292 --> 01:04:01,795
<i>What did I want for Christmas?</i>

925
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:04,465
<i>My Reggie, free and above board.</i>

926
01:04:04,842 --> 01:04:07,008
<i>But Ron wanted his Reggie back as well.</i>

927
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:09,638
<i>He longed for his gangster twin.</i>

928
01:04:09,802 --> 01:04:12,849
<i>And Reggie... he chose the
HIDE-A-WAY instead.</i>

929
01:04:17,686 --> 01:04:21,357
<i>The owner was Hugh McCowan, the
son of a baronet.</i>

930
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:24,901
<i>Though he was not usually intimidated
by the working classes...</i>

931
01:04:25,069 --> 01:04:27,195
<i>he agreed to sell half the club.</i>

932
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:29,680
<i>Reggie knew he'd get the rest in time.</i>

933
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:31,991
<i>A dirty deal for a clean life.</i>

934
01:04:32,492 --> 01:04:35,371
<i>Ron was terrified of
Reggie leaving him behind.</i>

935
01:04:35,535 --> 01:04:37,836
<i>He sent Mad Teddy round to kill the deal.
Listen, gentlemen...</i>

936
01:04:37,856 --> 01:04:39,206
I've spoken to Reggie
I'm sorry...

937
01:04:39,374 --> 01:04:41,877
I can't look at you, darling, or I'm
going to get lost in your eyes.

938
01:04:42,041 --> 01:04:44,263
I've got a deal with Reggie...
This is shit.

939
01:04:44,327 --> 01:04:46,421
I signed a contract.

940
01:04:46,673 --> 01:04:48,799
I have an arrangement with Reggie, ask him.

941
01:04:49,256 --> 01:04:50,841
Crap.
Gentlemen, please.

942
01:04:51,009 --> 01:04:52,635
Please, I have customers.

943
01:04:52,803 --> 01:04:54,597
Out of the way. That's it, come on.

944
01:04:54,761 --> 01:04:56,431
I have customers here, gentlemen, please.

945
01:04:56,599 --> 01:04:57,700
I have spoken to Reggie.

946
01:04:57,976 --> 01:05:01,267
We don't work for Reggie.
We work for Ronnie.

947
01:05:01,435 --> 01:05:03,313
<i>Ron almost got what he wanted.</i>

948
01:05:03,481 --> 01:05:06,440
<i>McCowan backed out of the deal,
but he also called the police.</i>

949
01:05:06,608 --> 01:05:09,275
<i>Reggie and Ron were both charged
with extortion.</i>

950
01:05:09,487 --> 01:05:12,069
Frannie, I'm tell you, the
police stitched me up.

951
01:05:12,238 --> 01:05:13,363
I am innocent.
I'm...

952
01:05:13,531 --> 01:05:15,280
completely innocent.
Even if you are...

953
01:05:15,449 --> 01:05:16,618
What?

954
01:05:16,994 --> 01:05:18,667
You're back in prison.

955
01:05:19,621 --> 01:05:20,722
You made a promise to me.

956
01:05:20,786 --> 01:05:23,000
And it still stands.
I'm fucking innocent!

957
01:05:26,251 --> 01:05:29,586
Sorry, I don't mean to
swear at you, alright?

958
01:05:32,297 --> 01:05:33,842
I really want you to marry me.

959
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:37,053
Please.

960
01:05:40,516 --> 01:05:43,559
If you're innocent and acquitted,
I'll marry you.

961
01:05:46,062 --> 01:05:49,313
If you're guilty, I never want to
see you again. Why do you say that?

962
01:05:49,481 --> 01:05:50,606
Frankie, don't...

963
01:05:50,774 --> 01:05:52,528
Frankie, don't.

964
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:55,947
<i>Strangely, it was Lord Boothby
who saved the day.</i>

965
01:05:56,195 --> 01:05:59,406
<i>His walk on the wild side
had not gone unnoticed.</i>

966
01:06:01,036 --> 01:06:03,246
I've finally found the photo.

967
01:06:04,411 --> 01:06:07,250
It's been forwarded to the proper places.

968
01:06:07,998 --> 01:06:09,668
Say: "Enugu".

969
01:06:09,832 --> 01:06:11,670
Enugu.

970
01:06:12,963 --> 01:06:16,050
The photograph taken in Boothby's
flat ended up with the paper.

971
01:06:16,214 --> 01:06:18,340
Along with the story of
sexual misconduct...

972
01:06:18,508 --> 01:06:21,219
between a gangster and the
member of the House of Lords.

973
01:06:22,056 --> 01:06:25,515
The problem is Arnold,
that, unfortunately...

974
01:06:25,767 --> 01:06:28,061
It's all true for once.

975
01:06:28,226 --> 01:06:30,728
I don't care about the truth, Harold.

976
01:06:30,896 --> 01:06:33,691
Except that, the greater the truth...

977
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:35,525
the greater the libel.

978
01:06:35,941 --> 01:06:37,234
An election was looming.

979
01:06:37,402 --> 01:06:40,946
But the Prime Minister brought in his
fixer, Arnold Goodman to sort things out.

980
01:06:41,114 --> 01:06:44,077
Get me Cecil King at the Sunday Mirror.

981
01:06:44,241 --> 01:06:48,205
The great and the good engineered
a cover-up. A cracking good one.

982
01:06:48,869 --> 01:06:52,501
When the Kray's defense threatened to call
Boothby as a character witness...

983
01:06:52,665 --> 01:06:54,166
the implication was clear.

984
01:06:54,458 --> 01:06:56,321
The government would have
to drop its case...

985
01:06:56,376 --> 01:06:58,090
or face the consequences.

986
01:06:58,254 --> 01:07:01,841
It was this that made the Krays
the untouchables of London crime.

987
01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:07,223
New information casts poor light on
the prosecution witness, Mr. McCowan.

988
01:07:09,517 --> 01:07:10,810
Case dismissed.

989
01:07:11,603 --> 01:07:16,023
That night the Kray's held their
celebration party at McCowan's club.

990
01:07:16,187 --> 01:07:18,609
Reggie had bought the
<font face="Mistral"> HIDE-A-WAY</font> that same afternoon.

991
01:07:18,774 --> 01:07:20,651
At a discount.

992
01:08:23,671 --> 01:08:24,772
Thank you.

993
01:09:17,971 --> 01:09:19,556
Why are you here, then?

994
01:09:21,766 --> 01:09:24,601
I've come to see the
difference between you and me.

995
01:09:25,438 --> 01:09:27,187
The difference, yeah?

996
01:09:28,148 --> 01:09:29,441
Alright.

997
01:09:30,651 --> 01:09:32,524
What do you know?
I grew up poor...

998
01:09:32,692 --> 01:09:34,110
like you.

999
01:09:34,278 --> 01:09:36,448
I boxed as a lad, like you.

1000
01:09:38,242 --> 01:09:40,116
But it didn't turn me into a thief.

1001
01:09:42,454 --> 01:09:45,248
But it did turn you into
policing, didn't it?

1002
01:09:46,289 --> 01:09:47,623
Yeah.

1003
01:09:47,831 --> 01:09:53,044
It did turn you into handing
your own over at the bar, innit?

1004
01:09:55,798 --> 01:09:58,509
You know, the difference
between us, right...

1005
01:09:58,801 --> 01:10:00,679
apart from, y'know, the obvious...

1006
01:10:00,843 --> 01:10:04,723
is that I, right, I work for me.

1007
01:10:05,223 --> 01:10:06,641
And you...

1008
01:10:07,309 --> 01:10:09,059
You work for them.

1009
01:10:24,073 --> 01:10:25,690
Sir, I can explain.

1010
01:10:25,703 --> 01:10:27,913
This is Scotland Yard.

1011
01:10:28,706 --> 01:10:30,663
And this investigation will end at once.

1012
01:10:30,832 --> 01:10:33,664
But there's so much more
that we can get them on...

1013
01:10:33,676 --> 01:10:36,629
Your investigation into
the Krays will end at once!

1014
01:11:19,125 --> 01:11:20,587
Alright, alright.- She's
wearing black, mate.

1015
01:11:20,755 --> 01:11:23,257
I know. I know. She's
read it wrong, isn't she?

1016
01:11:23,421 --> 01:11:25,180
She thought it was a fucking funeral.

1017
01:11:25,215 --> 01:11:28,847
Wearing black oh that fucking bitch.
I know. Don't drive yourself mad.

1018
01:11:29,011 --> 01:11:32,474
Wait'll you see the daughter,
she looks unbelievable in white.

1019
01:11:33,767 --> 01:11:35,933
What do you see in her?

1020
01:11:37,771 --> 01:11:41,106
I see meself, yeah.

1021
01:11:41,859 --> 01:11:43,440
I see what I could be.

1022
01:11:44,233 --> 01:11:45,402
Y'know?

1023
01:11:46,027 --> 01:11:49,614
If I wasn't so scared.
You're not afraid of anything.

1024
01:11:50,699 --> 01:11:52,090
Right.

1025
01:11:52,993 --> 01:11:55,119
Well, only meself, y'know.

1026
01:11:55,912 --> 01:11:58,374
And you.
Yeah.

1027
01:12:02,835 --> 01:12:03,980
What is she doing?

1028
01:12:04,044 --> 01:12:06,006
You know what she's going
to be saying, alright?

1029
01:12:06,170 --> 01:12:08,424
Just take it easy. Deep breaths.

1030
01:12:09,926 --> 01:12:11,341
Why are not you inside, dear?
Are you

1031
01:12:11,353 --> 01:12:13,137
absolutely sure you want
to go through with this?

1032
01:12:13,305 --> 01:12:15,723
Mom, please, don't start this again.
It's all right, Frank.

1033
01:12:17,224 --> 01:12:18,394
I love him.

1034
01:12:18,558 --> 01:12:19,727
Love.

1035
01:12:21,645 --> 01:12:23,815
Do you even know what love is, Frances?

1036
01:12:23,979 --> 01:12:26,233
Well, I know it's not
an answer to anything.

1037
01:12:27,318 --> 01:12:28,984
But love is a witness.

1038
01:12:30,153 --> 01:12:31,694
Reggie sees me.

1039
01:12:32,407 --> 01:12:33,948
And I see him.

1040
01:12:36,242 --> 01:12:38,036
And who are you to refuse that?

1041
01:12:39,037 --> 01:12:40,663
I'm your mother.

1042
01:12:44,336 --> 01:12:48,502
Ey. East End starlet, Frances.

1043
01:12:48,670 --> 01:12:49,811
That's you.

1044
01:12:49,879 --> 01:12:51,173
Thank you.

1045
01:13:14,655 --> 01:13:17,029
Oh, Ron, look at her.

1046
01:13:18,783 --> 01:13:20,701
She looks beautiful.

1047
01:13:23,996 --> 01:13:25,097
Enjoy yourself.

1048
01:13:31,463 --> 01:13:32,628
Gracious God...

1049
01:13:32,796 --> 01:13:36,047
accept our prayers for
Frances and Reginald...

1050
01:13:36,299 --> 01:13:38,970
that they may reap the
harvest of the Spirit...

1051
01:13:39,134 --> 01:13:43,054
and reflect your glory
through Christ Jesus our lord.

1052
01:13:43,222 --> 01:13:45,600
Amen.
Amen

1053
01:14:06,828 --> 01:14:08,246
Fucking... sing.

1054
01:14:20,842 --> 01:14:22,675
<i>We honeymooned in Greece.</i>

1055
01:14:23,176 --> 01:14:26,971
<i>The Parthenon had stood for two
thousand, four hundred years.</i>

1056
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:30,391
<i>Reggie's promise to go straight
lasted two weeks.</i>

1057
01:14:31,808 --> 01:14:33,309
Two Aces...

1058
01:14:34,230 --> 01:14:35,812
New Mill...

1059
01:14:36,312 --> 01:14:37,650
the Gigi Club...

1060
01:14:37,814 --> 01:14:39,527
and let's not forget Ronnie Scott.

1061
01:14:39,691 --> 01:14:42,694
And this is the bearer
bond cash in Hamburg.

1062
01:14:46,490 --> 01:14:48,408
The kettle's on the boil.

1063
01:14:48,908 --> 01:14:50,410
It is tea.

1064
01:14:51,246 --> 01:14:54,081
We started out near Marble
Arch in West London.

1065
01:14:54,249 --> 01:14:56,251
But we both missed the East End.

1066
01:14:56,415 --> 01:14:59,418
And so we took an empty flat
below Ron's at Cedra Court.

1067
01:14:59,795 --> 01:15:02,465
Like all else in life it was
supposed to be temporary.

1068
01:15:03,338 --> 01:15:05,092
Not very clever.

1069
01:15:06,593 --> 01:15:08,511
Ron's parties would keep me awake at night.

1070
01:15:08,679 --> 01:15:11,682
And clubland kept Reggie
out until all hours.

1071
01:15:12,098 --> 01:15:14,725
He enjoyed being a gangster, after all.
We heard

1072
01:15:14,737 --> 01:15:17,479
that you, uh, were down the
Regency the other night.

1073
01:15:20,354 --> 01:15:22,108
Waving a shotgun.

1074
01:15:24,942 --> 01:15:28,153
Those bastard Barry brothers
blocked me from coming in.

1075
01:15:29,282 --> 01:15:30,616
They said I was drunk.

1076
01:15:30,784 --> 01:15:33,410
You were!
You was drunk as a skunk.

1077
01:15:33,579 --> 01:15:34,952
Waving a shotgun.

1078
01:15:38,663 --> 01:15:40,086
No.

1079
01:15:41,626 --> 01:15:43,628
Now you know we look after that place.

1080
01:15:43,796 --> 01:15:44,897
Right?

1081
01:15:45,462 --> 01:15:48,048
We don't want you messing
around down there.

1082
01:15:48,757 --> 01:15:50,602
I spiced the evening up for people, y'know?

1083
01:15:52,428 --> 01:15:54,262
Spiced it up.

1084
01:15:55,099 --> 01:15:56,264
Here you go.

1085
01:16:06,566 --> 01:16:08,944
You're not going to do
that anymore, are you?

1086
01:16:09,653 --> 01:16:10,902
No, sir.

1087
01:16:11,655 --> 01:16:12,840
Good lad.

1088
01:16:15,658 --> 01:16:17,036
Oh, bollocks.

1089
01:16:17,452 --> 01:16:19,038
Go on, get up, Jack. Fuck.

1090
01:16:19,370 --> 01:16:21,372
This is so kind of you.

1091
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:23,498
Sweet, isn't it?
Lovely, yeah.

1092
01:16:24,251 --> 01:16:25,383
Oh, hello.

1093
01:16:29,017 --> 01:16:30,400
Oh, uh...

1094
01:16:31,465 --> 01:16:34,008
Is that OK??
No, no.

1095
01:16:34,176 --> 01:16:37,595
No, Frances, that wo...
that won't do. Umm...

1096
01:16:40,222 --> 01:16:42,684
Go and sit with Mr. Kray
and I'll sort it out.

1097
01:16:42,852 --> 01:16:43,977
Alright.

1098
01:16:51,609 --> 01:16:54,487
She can't even make a decent cup of tea.

1099
01:16:55,488 --> 01:16:56,821
Yeah, poor Reggie. ey?

1100
01:16:58,115 --> 01:16:59,576
It was a good effort.

1101
01:17:01,662 --> 01:17:04,453
She looks like a budgie in
that dress, doesn't she?

1102
01:17:04,913 --> 01:17:08,376
You reckon that a man wouldn't pick her
up if she was laying in the gutter.

1103
01:17:09,367 --> 01:17:11,902
Yeah.- Oh well.

1104
01:17:12,296 --> 01:17:14,714
Poor Reggie. Right, I swear...

1105
01:17:14,883 --> 01:17:15,984
I shall flush that.

1106
01:17:18,094 --> 01:17:19,887
<i>I left without saying goodbye.</i>

1107
01:17:20,552 --> 01:17:21,969
<i>A sad victory.</i>

1108
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:25,100
<i>I'd never be good enough
for their Reggie.</i>

1109
01:17:26,057 --> 01:17:27,811
<i>He was Nipper's Reggie as well.</i>

1110
01:17:28,688 --> 01:17:31,606
<i>Reed couldn't rest unless he clapped
eyes on my husband once a day.</i>

1111
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:35,110
<i>I often had to settle for the same.</i>

1112
01:17:35,402 --> 01:17:39,406
Wherever you're going,
don't stop until you get to the sea.

1113
01:17:39,614 --> 01:17:41,616
<i>But we all need something.</i>

1114
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:45,075
<i>What I shared with Ron
was needing pills to get through the day.</i>

1115
01:17:45,243 --> 01:17:49,287
<i>Sleeping pills helped sometimes,
other pills helped other times.</i>

1116
01:17:49,872 --> 01:17:52,126
<i>They were like a friend who
held no judgment...</i>

1117
01:17:52,290 --> 01:17:54,460
<i>and only wanted to be loved
in return.</i>

1118
01:17:55,129 --> 01:17:56,794
<i>Mother's little helpers.</i>

1119
01:17:56,962 --> 01:17:58,964
<i>They were very well named.</i>

1120
01:18:05,595 --> 01:18:07,012
Don't go too fast.

1121
01:18:07,180 --> 01:18:10,351
We're not going anywhere like too fast.
We're in the grass.

1122
01:18:10,852 --> 01:18:12,437
Alright, almost there.

1123
01:18:12,601 --> 01:18:13,895
Alright?
A bit more...

1124
01:18:14,591 --> 01:18:16,603
OK?- OK.

1125
01:18:16,565 --> 01:18:19,484
You ready?
Yes. Really ready? Yes.

1126
01:18:21,237 --> 01:18:22,903
Oh my God.

1127
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:24,781
Do you like it?

1128
01:18:24,949 --> 01:18:27,283
Yes, what... what kind is it?
What's it called?

1129
01:18:27,451 --> 01:18:30,494
It's uh, it's a Triumph. It's a Spitfire.
Triumph Spitfire. Can I get in?

1130
01:18:30,662 --> 01:18:34,250
Yeah, of course you can, it's yours.
Happy Birthday. Here y'are.

1131
01:18:35,123 --> 01:18:37,877
Happy Birthday, Frances.
Thank you.

1132
01:18:38,378 --> 01:18:40,256
Will you teach me how to drive?

1133
01:18:41,065 --> 01:18:43,090
Uhhh, I can.

1134
01:18:43,258 --> 01:18:46,762
Now?
Umm... not today.

1135
01:18:47,719 --> 01:18:48,888
Why not?

1136
01:18:49,845 --> 01:18:51,847
I... uh... just can't... not today.

1137
01:18:53,768 --> 01:18:57,480
But I can tomorrow.
Alright.

1138
01:18:57,644 --> 01:18:58,813
Sorry.

1139
01:19:08,049 --> 01:19:09,382
Kray.

1140
01:19:10,175 --> 01:19:11,717
Kray.

1141
01:19:12,470 --> 01:19:17,099
There's an inherent threat
in that one commanding syllable.

1142
01:19:17,267 --> 01:19:19,433
It's the only word
some need to hear.

1143
01:19:20,102 --> 01:19:22,352
What's that mean? The only word?

1144
01:19:22,728 --> 01:19:25,023
Well, you're like Ford.

1145
01:19:25,191 --> 01:19:26,400
Oh yeah. Or Shell.

1146
01:19:26,569 --> 01:19:28,318
Or Woolworth's.

1147
01:19:28,695 --> 01:19:32,907
Woolworth's. Yes, that's... uh...
that's very interesting.

1148
01:19:33,075 --> 01:19:36,579
What I'm saying is Kray is a brand...

1149
01:19:36,743 --> 01:19:40,956
and an established reputation
means less maintenance, less violence.

1150
01:19:41,124 --> 01:19:43,334
Y'know? People fall, actually, into line.

1151
01:19:43,502 --> 01:19:45,837
Clubs are asking for our protection
before we even offer it.

1152
01:19:46,005 --> 01:19:48,964
Yeah, that's true, actually.
They, uh, yes..

1153
01:19:49,216 --> 01:19:51,927
I suppose that would leave us with
less straightening out to do.

1154
01:19:52,095 --> 01:19:54,306
He's right.

1155
01:19:55,223 --> 01:19:56,472
Makes sense.

1156
01:19:57,101 --> 01:19:59,227
See, but I happen to like...

1157
01:19:59,391 --> 01:20:01,770
I like straightening out, y'know?
Once in a while...

1158
01:20:01,938 --> 01:20:04,024
obliging someone to the old cobbles, ey?

1159
01:20:04,188 --> 01:20:05,442
Whats wrong with that?

1160
01:20:05,610 --> 01:20:08,445
I just think you could
do better, Ron, y'know.

1161
01:20:09,193 --> 01:20:12,157
It will keep you out of prison. I mean,
none of us are getting any younger.

1162
01:20:12,325 --> 01:20:14,575
Y'know, you need to leave
this all behind you, I mean.

1163
01:20:14,743 --> 01:20:17,702
Y'know, you've got to look to the future,
you and that lovely young wife of yours.

1164
01:20:17,871 --> 01:20:19,665
Fairy tales!

1165
01:20:19,833 --> 01:20:21,374
That's fucking water.

1166
01:20:21,542 --> 01:20:24,001
This is a firm, right? I'm a fucking face.

1167
01:20:24,169 --> 01:20:25,587
Are you alright, mate? Can you see?

1168
01:20:25,755 --> 01:20:28,133
I'll fucking serve you
up, you fucking cunt.

1169
01:20:28,842 --> 01:20:30,592
Fucking bent out of order!

1170
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:32,435
I don't fucking like him.
I don't trust him.

1171
01:20:32,447 --> 01:20:34,096
He talks too much, ask
too many questions.

1172
01:20:34,264 --> 01:20:35,681
I want him fucking dead.

1173
01:20:35,850 --> 01:20:38,725
Leslie Payne, right, is our business, mate,
and you want him dead?

1174
01:20:38,893 --> 01:20:40,281
It's... I mean, have
you been taking your

1175
01:20:40,293 --> 01:20:41,856
tablets?- Fuck tablets, right?
Bugger tablets.

1176
01:20:42,020 --> 01:20:46,024
Bugger Payne, the fucking... pain
in the ass and fuck his briefcase.

1177
01:20:46,192 --> 01:20:49,528
I don't give a fuck what's in there. I
want to know what's going on up there.

1178
01:20:54,117 --> 01:20:56,996
He knows too much about... things.

1179
01:20:57,164 --> 01:21:00,415
Things about us, Reggie.
He knows too many things about us.

1180
01:21:00,584 --> 01:21:02,001
He knows too many things about us?

1181
01:21:02,169 --> 01:21:04,712
Right, Albie, do you know
things about us, ey?

1182
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:06,590
You know things, ey?

1183
01:21:06,882 --> 01:21:09,133
About Ron... about me,
about the firm, right?

1184
01:21:09,301 --> 01:21:11,135
You know about... about payments, right?

1185
01:21:11,303 --> 01:21:12,720
Do you know that we cash
bearer bonds, yeah?

1186
01:21:12,889 --> 01:21:16,224
Do you know we pay off juries to make them
look fucking favorably upon us, do you?

1187
01:21:16,392 --> 01:21:17,573
Yes.

1188
01:21:17,850 --> 01:21:21,522
You do. There's a fucking surprise. Jack,
mate, do you know anything about fraud?

1189
01:21:21,690 --> 01:21:22,979
Anything at all. Take a punt.

1190
01:21:23,147 --> 01:21:25,807
Do you know anything about
how we pay off policemen

1191
01:21:25,819 --> 01:21:28,029
every fucking final
Thursday of the month.

1192
01:21:28,197 --> 01:21:30,155
Do you know that?
Course I do.

1193
01:21:30,323 --> 01:21:33,034
Fucking surprise, that. So
why don't we kill Jack, now?

1194
01:21:33,202 --> 01:21:36,037
Or we do Albie as well?
We'll do the fucking lot.

1195
01:21:36,205 --> 01:21:38,916
Or you can do me and I'll do you,
then we're both fucking dead.

1196
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:40,374
That's a genius idea.

1197
01:21:40,542 --> 01:21:43,501
Listen to yourself, Ron.
You're fucking nuts.

1198
01:21:48,258 --> 01:21:53,223
People who live in glass houses
shouldn't throw stones.

1199
01:21:55,474 --> 01:21:58,501
Did you know I never drank gin
until I came here?

1200
01:21:58,685 --> 01:22:01,604
Oh, well next you'll be singing
God Save the Queen, won't ya?

1201
01:22:03,482 --> 01:22:05,860
What did you want to have a
word with me about, Mr. Bruno?

1202
01:22:06,109 --> 01:22:08,820
Well things are going well,
we're very happy on my side of the pond.

1203
01:22:09,156 --> 01:22:11,659
Well that's good. Y'know,
we're very, very happy also.

1204
01:22:12,323 --> 01:22:13,617
OK.

1205
01:22:14,033 --> 01:22:15,202
Cheers.

1206
01:22:16,328 --> 01:22:17,537
Cheers.

1207
01:22:18,165 --> 01:22:20,752
Do you realize that I asked
to speak to you alone?

1208
01:22:22,086 --> 01:22:24,504
You see, in our line of work...

1209
01:22:25,966 --> 01:22:27,800
it is not good to be famous.

1210
01:22:28,633 --> 01:22:30,635
Anonymous is the goal.

1211
01:22:32,929 --> 01:22:34,723
It's Mr. Lansky, Reg.

1212
01:22:35,139 --> 01:22:37,434
He sees a lot of potential in you.

1213
01:22:37,850 --> 01:22:40,189
But he sees limitations
in your brother Ron.

1214
01:22:40,605 --> 01:22:42,647
Well, yeah. Maybe... maybe...

1215
01:22:42,815 --> 01:22:44,808
they could just sit down and
meet each other. Couldn't they?

1216
01:22:44,858 --> 01:22:48,113
I mean, he could come across for a chat.
A chat?

1217
01:22:49,238 --> 01:22:51,240
You guys crack me up, really.

1218
01:22:52,826 --> 01:22:56,083
You ever hear of the Gallo brothers?
From Brooklyn? No.

1219
01:22:56,330 --> 01:22:58,748
Similar loose cannon situation.

1220
01:22:59,333 --> 01:23:00,794
You see, Ron is your Joey.

1221
01:23:01,419 --> 01:23:03,962
And it's not going to end
well in either case.

1222
01:23:08,511 --> 01:23:11,346
What exactly are you asking
me to do, Mr. Bruno?

1223
01:23:12,347 --> 01:23:14,765
I'm asking you to do something about Ron.

1224
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:19,354
I can't do that.

1225
01:23:20,771 --> 01:23:22,397
He's my brother.

1226
01:23:24,820 --> 01:23:26,029
OK.

1227
01:24:10,532 --> 01:24:11,677
There's nothing I can do.

1228
01:24:11,741 --> 01:24:12,950
I ain't finished with you, yet.

1229
01:24:13,119 --> 01:24:16,706
Mr. Kray takes care of this warehouse.
Now you say Kray one more time...

1230
01:24:18,164 --> 01:24:20,751
and I'm gonna hurt you, you understand?

1231
01:24:21,167 --> 01:24:22,672
I have an arrangement with Mr.
Kray. - I

1232
01:24:22,684 --> 01:24:24,423
didn't ask you whether
you had an arrangement.

1233
01:24:24,591 --> 01:24:27,133
I asked if you understood me.

1234
01:24:27,466 --> 01:24:29,636
<i>The Richardson gang were away.</i>

1235
01:24:29,804 --> 01:24:32,229
<i>But George Cornell had
crossed the river to work</i>

1236
01:24:32,241 --> 01:24:34,141
<i>the protection racket
on their behalf.</i>

1237
01:24:34,765 --> 01:24:37,352
I fucking warned you.

1238
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:40,816
<i>Ron's response would secure his place
in gangster legend.</i>

1239
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:42,907
What is that? Is that
English breakfast tea? You

1240
01:24:42,919 --> 01:24:44,820
can tell by your face,
Ted, what you think of it.

1241
01:24:44,984 --> 01:24:48,656
Lovely box, innit. It is not an
English breakfast, that's not, no.

1242
01:24:49,033 --> 01:24:51,952
That's got pheromones in it, that's got.

1243
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:54,162
That's musky.

1244
01:24:54,414 --> 01:24:56,833
That's best bit of magic, that is.

1245
01:24:57,706 --> 01:24:59,500
That's very beautiful, innit?

1246
01:24:59,668 --> 01:25:02,379
I'm glad you like it.
I do... that's... that's proper.

1247
01:25:02,755 --> 01:25:05,382
Me mum will be very,
very pleased with that.

1248
01:25:05,550 --> 01:25:07,783
Do you have that away from
the old warehouse, did

1249
01:25:07,795 --> 01:25:10,219
ya?- Yeah.- Don't say anything,
I mean, it's alright.

1250
01:25:10,387 --> 01:25:12,681
Goes to Mrs. Kray.
Thank you.

1251
01:25:12,850 --> 01:25:13,991
And the other matter.

1252
01:25:14,059 --> 01:25:16,393
Yeah, what matter?

1253
01:25:25,571 --> 01:25:27,696
What, that?
Yeah

1254
01:25:27,990 --> 01:25:29,159
Right...

1255
01:25:30,284 --> 01:25:33,455
I mean, I'm not in the mind
to hand out refunds, am I?

1256
01:25:37,123 --> 01:25:38,961
Can't you handle it yourself?

1257
01:25:40,002 --> 01:25:42,465
I pay you for protection, Ron.

1258
01:25:46,469 --> 01:25:47,634
What are you trying to say?

1259
01:25:48,259 --> 01:25:51,430
Nothing... You just said it, didn't you?
You fucking said it.

1260
01:25:51,599 --> 01:25:55,212
You come in here with
your fucking nose, right?

1261
01:25:55,559 --> 01:25:56,768
And your tea.

1262
01:25:56,936 --> 01:25:59,062
Your fucking exotic tea.

1263
01:25:59,231 --> 01:26:01,901
Right? And you say that.

1264
01:26:02,234 --> 01:26:04,360
I'm not very good at my job.

1265
01:26:04,528 --> 01:26:07,323
I didn't mean it like that.
You fucking did.

1266
01:26:08,324 --> 01:26:09,618
No, I...
Uh!

1267
01:26:10,158 --> 01:26:11,576
I'll tell you what.

1268
01:26:12,537 --> 01:26:14,539
This matter of yours...

1269
01:26:14,747 --> 01:26:18,167
I'll deal with it for you. Alright?

1270
01:26:18,335 --> 01:26:23,925
You go with Teddy, right,
and you bring me two thousand pounds, OK?

1271
01:26:24,509 --> 01:26:29,763
And in return, I promise that I
will have George Cornell killed.

1272
01:26:30,804 --> 01:26:32,057
Alright?

1273
01:26:32,305 --> 01:26:34,019
I didn't say...
Alright?

1274
01:26:34,352 --> 01:26:38,732
I didn't saying anything about
killing, Ron. You fucking did!

1275
01:26:39,233 --> 01:26:41,900
You fucking meant it.
Look at you, you meant it with your eyes.

1276
01:26:42,068 --> 01:26:43,317
Look at your eyes.

1277
01:26:43,485 --> 01:26:45,571
Ey? It's in your fucking eyes.

1278
01:26:45,740 --> 01:26:47,658
Are you threatening me?
No.

1279
01:26:47,822 --> 01:26:50,116
Cos there is death in your eyes
and you're fucking threatening me.

1280
01:26:50,284 --> 01:26:52,602
Is he threatening me?
It's hard to tell, Ron.

1281
01:26:52,622 --> 01:26:53,840
I'll pay.
You what?

1282
01:26:53,904 --> 01:26:57,292
I'll pay. You will? Yeah.
There it is. And a deal is a deal.

1283
01:26:57,460 --> 01:26:58,561
It's done.
Yeah.

1284
01:26:58,625 --> 01:27:01,756
It's done. It's over.
Teddy, take him.

1285
01:27:02,629 --> 01:27:03,923
Thank you.

1286
01:27:04,091 --> 01:27:05,801
Very kind of you...

1287
01:27:05,969 --> 01:27:08,219
Thank you -
for the tea.

1288
01:27:11,391 --> 01:27:13,140
That's a good deal.

1289
01:27:33,870 --> 01:27:35,372
How do I look?

1290
01:27:36,333 --> 01:27:37,959
Fucking deadly.

1291
01:27:39,128 --> 01:27:41,130
You want me to come in with you?

1292
01:27:42,255 --> 01:27:43,801
In there?

1293
01:27:46,051 --> 01:27:47,429
Come on.

1294
01:27:48,346 --> 01:27:50,264
You'll stay in the car.

1295
01:27:52,726 --> 01:27:54,476
Anything you need to tell me?

1296
01:28:01,776 --> 01:28:03,654
Well look what the cat dragged in.

1297
01:28:04,615 --> 01:28:05,824
Jesus.

1298
01:28:09,952 --> 01:28:12,331
Yeah, you're not laughing now, are you?

1299
01:28:13,124 --> 01:28:15,206
For fuck's sake.

1300
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,293
Boss? The fuck?

1301
01:28:21,713 --> 01:28:23,298
Get off the phone.

1302
01:28:23,843 --> 01:28:25,425
Shut up, you heard.

1303
01:28:25,593 --> 01:28:27,303
What are you fucking looking at?

1304
01:28:27,471 --> 01:28:29,057
You didn't see nothing.

1305
01:28:34,895 --> 01:28:36,857
That's Ronnie Kray, that is, innit?

1306
01:28:37,021 --> 01:28:38,482
Fucking hell.

1307
01:28:52,830 --> 01:28:54,234
Reggie.

1308
01:28:55,416 --> 01:28:57,250
Are you mad?

1309
01:28:58,628 --> 01:29:00,297
The Blind Beggar, yeah? Cornell?

1310
01:29:01,675 --> 01:29:03,008
It's on the fucking radio.

1311
01:29:03,177 --> 01:29:04,550
Reggie.

1312
01:29:05,887 --> 01:29:06,988
Hi, Mum.

1313
01:29:09,099 --> 01:29:10,893
Oh, thank you, cheers.

1314
01:29:12,935 --> 01:29:14,120
Oh, look at you!

1315
01:29:15,522 --> 01:29:17,692
Look how handsome you are.

1316
01:29:19,694 --> 01:29:22,153
I'll get you a cup of tea.
Thanks, Mum.

1317
01:29:22,321 --> 01:29:24,739
Albie? I'm all right, Violet.
Thank you.

1318
01:29:30,786 --> 01:29:32,580
You do look lovely, Reg.

1319
01:29:34,750 --> 01:29:38,085
How many witnesses?
Well, it was a quiet night.

1320
01:29:38,254 --> 01:29:40,424
Seven.
Seven?

1321
01:29:40,588 --> 01:29:42,005
Albert Woods was with Cornell.

1322
01:29:42,174 --> 01:29:44,220
Plus five regulars.
I don't know them.

1323
01:29:44,384 --> 01:29:47,723
And that barmaid, the blonde? The one
with the big fucking pair of eyes.

1324
01:29:47,888 --> 01:29:49,073
Fuck's sake.

1325
01:29:49,141 --> 01:29:51,852
And you bring this here? This is where you
bring it? You bring it straight to mums?

1326
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:55,896
Don't moan about it, right? It's done,
innit? What are we going to do? Hmm?

1327
01:29:56,941 --> 01:29:58,815
We?
Yeah.

1328
01:30:05,030 --> 01:30:06,367
Where's the weapon?

1329
01:30:06,699 --> 01:30:08,077
It's here, Reg.

1330
01:30:11,164 --> 01:30:15,877
There you go. Now, uh... would
you like a piece of cake?

1331
01:30:16,041 --> 01:30:18,796
You know what? That would be lovely.
So... yeah. Thank you, mum.

1332
01:30:18,964 --> 01:30:22,424
It is. It's lovely.
Thanks.

1333
01:30:24,634 --> 01:30:26,552
They've seen you wearing
those clothes, right?

1334
01:30:26,721 --> 01:30:30,100
Yeah. Yeah.
So where's his jacket?

1335
01:30:31,057 --> 01:30:32,242
Right, you need to burn that.

1336
01:30:32,311 --> 01:30:34,773
And that gun, we need to toss it
in the river right fucking now.

1337
01:30:35,145 --> 01:30:36,523
Alright? Go on, fuck off.

1338
01:30:41,554 --> 01:30:44,299
You're... uh... you're unbelievable.

1339
01:30:45,364 --> 01:30:49,453
Albie? Whoever was in that pub, we have
to find out who they are, alright?

1340
01:30:49,621 --> 01:30:52,748
And get hold of them and just unravel
whatever they've said to the police.

1341
01:30:53,126 --> 01:30:55,503
Right, what we want to do is get Pat and
Bender and send them down in there.

1342
01:30:55,667 --> 01:30:56,960
That bartender I know her, right?
You know her?

1343
01:30:57,129 --> 01:30:59,339
Alright, well, bring her to me.
I'll deal with her myself.

1344
01:30:59,507 --> 01:31:00,925
Alright? Go on, fuck off.

1345
01:31:01,719 --> 01:31:05,221
Oh, where is everybody going?

1346
01:31:05,970 --> 01:31:08,657
Oh, mum, it's late. It's late. I
wanted them out of your hair, y'know.

1347
01:31:08,692 --> 01:31:10,809
You should get some bedtime.

1348
01:31:10,935 --> 01:31:12,729
Why don't I give you a life home? Come on.

1349
01:31:13,438 --> 01:31:15,480
Oh, it's alright. I am home.

1350
01:31:16,525 --> 01:31:19,444
I've made the bed up for him.
He's not well.

1351
01:31:21,610 --> 01:31:23,240
He's, uh... He's got a fever.

1352
01:31:24,574 --> 01:31:26,408
He's gonna stay here tonight.

1353
01:31:27,537 --> 01:31:30,704
Teddy, you like to stay with him?

1354
01:31:33,291 --> 01:31:35,918
Thanks, that would be very nice.
Thank you, Violet.

1355
01:31:42,509 --> 01:31:44,511
Whatever he's done...

1356
01:31:46,136 --> 01:31:48,138
He's your brother.

1357
01:31:57,440 --> 01:31:58,610
Yeah.

1358
01:31:59,541 --> 01:32:03,019
Well, ummm...

1359
01:32:03,739 --> 01:32:05,701
Here's your Stemetil, mate.

1360
01:32:06,494 --> 01:32:08,496
You should take that.

1361
01:32:11,039 --> 01:32:14,042
Do you know what? I'm going
to have to go, actually.

1362
01:32:14,294 --> 01:32:16,212
I left the lads at work...

1363
01:32:16,713 --> 01:32:18,298
and I have to clean up.

1364
01:32:19,171 --> 01:32:22,258
So I'm going to say g'night.
G'night.

1365
01:32:25,846 --> 01:32:29,102
Teddy, couldn't do us a favor?
Could you be useful?

1366
01:32:29,266 --> 01:32:31,144
When you takes his pantses off tonight...

1367
01:32:31,312 --> 01:32:33,404
and his shirt... can you burn them?

1368
01:32:33,439 --> 01:32:35,024
Yeah, and check in with me?

1369
01:32:35,188 --> 01:32:36,902
- Yeah.
- Good lad.

1370
01:32:38,151 --> 01:32:39,821
Night, mum.

1371
01:32:39,985 --> 01:32:41,238
Night.

1372
01:32:46,660 --> 01:32:48,286
He's lovely, isn't he?

1373
01:32:54,709 --> 01:32:58,048
<i>Not even Scotland Yard could ignore
murder on the street.</i>

1374
01:32:58,212 --> 01:33:00,214
<i>Nipper was back on the case.</i>

1375
01:33:00,383 --> 01:33:02,677
Gentlemen, your attention please.

1376
01:33:03,718 --> 01:33:07,722
Now you've been told that we are
conducting a high-level investigation...

1377
01:33:07,891 --> 01:33:10,353
into a major corruption allegation.

1378
01:33:10,685 --> 01:33:15,983
In fact, we're going down into
the sewer after the Krays.

1379
01:33:18,402 --> 01:33:22,530
Any man with any objection...
come and see me.

1380
01:33:26,242 --> 01:33:28,620
See that lamppost up there, right?

1381
01:33:28,913 --> 01:33:31,668
That was known as the safety
point during the war, right?

1382
01:33:31,832 --> 01:33:33,377
So if you could run to that lamppost...

1383
01:33:33,542 --> 01:33:35,845
You knew that you could
make it to the air raid

1384
01:33:35,857 --> 01:33:37,882
shelter before the bombs
started dropping.

1385
01:33:39,468 --> 01:33:43,889
One night, right, me and Ron, we
just stood there and we watched.

1386
01:33:44,513 --> 01:33:48,017
And we saw the old Stanton House get
blown to bits. They were still in it.

1387
01:33:48,726 --> 01:33:50,560
It's a wonder you lived through it.

1388
01:33:50,728 --> 01:33:53,354
Yeah... yeah, especially Ron, y'know.

1389
01:33:53,523 --> 01:33:56,774
Every time trouble came on top, he was
always dragging behind, innit he?

1390
01:33:57,359 --> 01:34:00,322
Well, he's got plenty of trouble now
if the stories are true.

1391
01:34:01,823 --> 01:34:03,826
I heard it on the street, Reggie.

1392
01:34:03,994 --> 01:34:06,536
My own family
and you didn't tell me.

1393
01:34:06,705 --> 01:34:09,371
Yeah, well, y'know, I didn't
want you to worry, did I?

1394
01:34:09,540 --> 01:34:12,758
I don't worry about Ron.
What are you planning to do about it?

1395
01:34:12,793 --> 01:34:15,338
I can't let him go to prison, am I
Why not? Why not?

1396
01:34:16,923 --> 01:34:19,174
Why not? Because he's my
brother, that's why not.

1397
01:34:19,342 --> 01:34:22,177
He'll still be your brother in prison.
No.

1398
01:34:22,553 --> 01:34:25,224
No, Frances, look. He belongs
here, right, he belongs with us.

1399
01:34:25,388 --> 01:34:28,435
He belongs to you, me and his family.
This is his home, alright?

1400
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:30,423
Y'know, I've been looking
after him since we

1401
01:34:30,435 --> 01:34:32,147
were little boys. It's
just the way it is.

1402
01:34:32,312 --> 01:34:34,650
You can still look after him in prison.

1403
01:34:35,275 --> 01:34:37,277
And he doesn't belong
here, and you know it.

1404
01:34:38,278 --> 01:34:39,463
Right.

1405
01:34:41,113 --> 01:34:43,451
Right. Well, you just don't understand.

1406
01:34:43,868 --> 01:34:45,954
Yes, I do. No, you don't. You
don't understand. Yes, I do.

1407
01:34:46,118 --> 01:34:48,150
You once told me that you
don't owe the world a

1408
01:34:48,162 --> 01:34:50,206
thing. Well you don't owe
Ron a thing, either.

1409
01:34:51,416 --> 01:34:54,379
My loyalty for my brother is how I
measure myself, do you understand?

1410
01:34:54,547 --> 01:34:57,006
What about your loyalty to me?
Is that not a measure?

1411
01:34:58,675 --> 01:35:01,470
So... what is going on
with your eyes right now?

1412
01:35:01,634 --> 01:35:02,888
Are you on something?

1413
01:35:03,056 --> 01:35:04,289
Are you taking something, Frances?
Are you taking...

1414
01:35:04,314 --> 01:35:05,454
you taking pills again? Is
that what you're doing?

1415
01:35:05,599 --> 01:35:07,016
Let's have a look.

1416
01:35:07,184 --> 01:35:08,894
No, stop it.
Oh hello, look at that.

1417
01:35:09,062 --> 01:35:11,521
Jesus Christ, Frances, how many
of these things are you on, ey?

1418
01:35:11,773 --> 01:35:13,070
No wonder you're not
making any sense.

1419
01:35:13,095 --> 01:35:14,924
You're popping pills everywhere.
You're a pill-popper.

1420
01:35:15,069 --> 01:35:17,301
And who made me that?
What? A pillpopper?

1421
01:35:19,573 --> 01:35:22,770
So let me get this straight. What
you're saying is that in order

1422
01:35:22,795 --> 01:35:25,892
for us all to be free, yeah, that
we all have to be on our own?

1423
01:35:27,205 --> 01:35:29,956
That's great, Frances. That's...
I'll go with that.

1424
01:35:30,125 --> 01:35:33,168
Listen... talk to that barmaid.
Yeah?

1425
01:35:33,336 --> 01:35:35,513
Tell her when they line the
suspects up across from

1426
01:35:35,525 --> 01:35:37,757
her to point the finger at
Ron and say, "That's him."

1427
01:35:37,925 --> 01:35:39,759
"That's the man had to
ought to have done it."

1428
01:35:39,927 --> 01:35:41,096
Alright?

1429
01:35:42,886 --> 01:35:45,224
Where are you going?
Home.

1430
01:35:46,141 --> 01:35:47,475
What about me mum?

1431
01:35:47,643 --> 01:35:49,645
Fuck your mum!

1432
01:36:14,572 --> 01:36:16,406
Take your time.
No.

1433
01:36:17,283 --> 01:36:19,409
The man who shot Cornell is not here.

1434
01:36:20,162 --> 01:36:21,579
Are you sure?

1435
01:36:21,747 --> 01:36:24,334
Yes, I'm sure.

1436
01:36:24,998 --> 01:36:27,253
Please, can someone just take me home?

1437
01:36:38,472 --> 01:36:39,681
Miss.

1438
01:36:44,017 --> 01:36:48,566
I swear it, though. I smelt something...
I don't know what it was.

1439
01:36:48,730 --> 01:36:51,317
But I caught funny looks in the court.
The judge...

1440
01:36:52,402 --> 01:36:54,236
I think he stinked, it was.

1441
01:36:55,112 --> 01:36:56,866
Right? Am I right or am I wrong?

1442
01:36:57,030 --> 01:36:59,156
Am I wrong, Reg?

1443
01:36:59,277 --> 01:37:01,719
It goes to show you that you can give a dog
a bad name...

1444
01:37:01,787 --> 01:37:05,246
but when that dog's name is Kray, he
might bite you back. Well done, Ron.

1445
01:37:05,415 --> 01:37:07,625
Justice is done.

1446
01:37:09,042 --> 01:37:10,544
Welcome home.

1447
01:37:12,422 --> 01:37:13,631
To discipline.

1448
01:37:13,799 --> 01:37:15,593
Take one, Vi.
No.

1449
01:37:15,757 --> 01:37:18,095
Give her a pink wafer.

1450
01:37:20,346 --> 01:37:22,099
<i>Somebody has to eat them.</i>

1451
01:37:38,363 --> 01:37:39,865
What did you tell her?

1452
01:37:44,121 --> 01:37:47,541
Yeah, I just said that you might want
to think about your children, y'know?

1453
01:37:50,752 --> 01:37:53,086
I wish I could make you go away.

1454
01:37:54,047 --> 01:37:58,175
Well, good luck with that, Frances.
Yeah, good fucking luck with that.

1455
01:38:43,761 --> 01:38:45,723
Holy cameroon.

1456
01:38:47,056 --> 01:38:48,978
The fuck is she doing?

1457
01:38:52,854 --> 01:38:55,484
It surprises me that some
people are still uhh...

1458
01:38:56,649 --> 01:38:58,527
still survive these days.

1459
01:38:58,695 --> 01:39:00,237
See you later, Albie.

1460
01:39:02,992 --> 01:39:05,618
Are you alright?
Yeah, go on.

1461
01:39:07,576 --> 01:39:09,955
Are you alright? You look
like you're struggling there.

1462
01:39:10,247 --> 01:39:11,708
Help me.

1463
01:39:12,001 --> 01:39:14,920
Help you?
Well, what are we doing?

1464
01:39:15,084 --> 01:39:18,379
Help me put the top on.
Well, I'm not sure I can help you, y'know?

1465
01:39:18,547 --> 01:39:20,049
Reggie, please, it's going to get ruined.

1466
01:39:20,217 --> 01:39:22,591
I can't, y'know? I'm a club owner.

1467
01:39:22,759 --> 01:39:26,095
Y'know what I mean? I can pick a nice
model, right, and a nice color...

1468
01:39:26,263 --> 01:39:29,598
but I'm not very good at it. I'm
not a mechanic, am I, y'know?

1469
01:39:29,766 --> 01:39:33,270
I'm more of a gangster.
Isn't that right? Yeah?

1470
01:39:33,438 --> 01:39:36,313
Please, help me. Please, help me?
Yeah...

1471
01:39:36,898 --> 01:39:38,067
Please.

1472
01:39:38,607 --> 01:39:39,985
Please, Reggie.

1473
01:39:41,570 --> 01:39:43,572
Alright, let's help you.
Go on then.

1474
01:39:44,489 --> 01:39:45,614
How about that?

1475
01:39:45,782 --> 01:39:48,785
That looks a bit fucking
fucked to me, mate.

1476
01:39:49,618 --> 01:39:50,996
Speaking of...

1477
01:39:52,041 --> 01:39:53,999
You look like shit and all.

1478
01:40:05,145 --> 01:40:05,998
Yeah...

1479
01:40:39,212 --> 01:40:40,337
What are you doing?

1480
01:40:40,505 --> 01:40:42,299
Reggie, stop it! Stop it!

1481
01:40:48,677 --> 01:40:49,930
Reggie.

1482
01:40:53,181 --> 01:40:55,183
Alright. Stop what?

1483
01:40:55,352 --> 01:40:57,478
Reggie, please. Don't. Please don't.

1484
01:40:57,646 --> 01:40:59,440
Please... no.

1485
01:40:59,608 --> 01:41:01,734
Please. No!

1486
01:41:02,026 --> 01:41:03,302
Stop it!

1487
01:41:11,660 --> 01:41:14,579
Life goes on without me.

1488
01:41:18,627 --> 01:41:20,128
Where are you going?

1489
01:41:21,794 --> 01:41:23,420
I'm leaving Reggie.

1490
01:41:24,004 --> 01:41:26,675
Oh, that is a shame. He'll
take that very hard.

1491
01:41:27,259 --> 01:41:29,261
Please get out of my way, Ron.

1492
01:41:29,594 --> 01:41:31,640
Unless you'd prefer me to stay.

1493
01:41:33,974 --> 01:41:36,393
Go on, boys.
Go upstairs.

1494
01:41:40,729 --> 01:41:42,150
Would you like me to
help you with your bags?

1495
01:41:42,483 --> 01:41:44,360
No, thank you.
Oh, come on, don't be daft.

1496
01:41:44,525 --> 01:41:48,364
Look at the size of you. Look at
the size of me. C'mon. Come on.

1497
01:41:48,945 --> 01:41:52,240
You know, Frances, sometimes
to achieve greatness...

1498
01:41:52,408 --> 01:41:54,743
You do. You have to cut off a
little piece of yourself...

1499
01:41:54,911 --> 01:41:57,622
No matter how much it hurts in order
to grow. In order to move on.

1500
01:41:57,790 --> 01:42:00,416
It takes courage and I admire that, y'know?

1501
01:42:00,749 --> 01:42:03,628
To be honest, you're
getting out just in time.

1502
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:06,462
You think so?
Absolutely, yeah.

1503
01:42:06,631 --> 01:42:08,801
There are so many people
that know so much about us.

1504
01:42:08,965 --> 01:42:10,511
Not you, of course.

1505
01:42:12,180 --> 01:42:14,891
Most people hate us.

1506
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:19,187
Sooner or later someone's going to talk
and that will be it. It'll all be over.

1507
01:42:19,728 --> 01:42:21,690
That wouldn't be so bad, would it?

1508
01:42:24,941 --> 01:42:27,860
I think God ought to cut us some
slack, though, don't you think?

1509
01:42:29,405 --> 01:42:31,199
Yeah, I'm sure God will.

1510
01:42:34,242 --> 01:42:37,493
That is, uh... that is bang out of order.

1511
01:42:37,662 --> 01:42:40,372
That's not how we were brought up.
Not at all.

1512
01:42:41,497 --> 01:42:42,667
Ron, I've got to go.

1513
01:42:42,919 --> 01:42:44,420
Yeah, of course you do.

1514
01:42:44,584 --> 01:42:49,718
Listen here, Frances,
alright, we both love him, alright?

1515
01:42:49,882 --> 01:42:52,008
We've both made the effort.

1516
01:42:52,344 --> 01:42:55,764
So we should just have to see what happens
when we get there.

1517
01:42:57,934 --> 01:42:59,156
Where?

1518
01:43:01,770 --> 01:43:02,895
Heaven.

1519
01:43:09,986 --> 01:43:11,403
Goodbye, Ron.

1520
01:43:12,156 --> 01:43:13,613
Goodbye, Frances.

1521
01:43:15,243 --> 01:43:16,700
Listen here...

1522
01:43:18,078 --> 01:43:22,038
I always liked you, Frances.
I always did.

1523
01:43:22,498 --> 01:43:26,210
Because you have the ability
to see into the future.

1524
01:43:26,586 --> 01:43:31,299
You do. And that's the same as me.

1525
01:43:32,176 --> 01:43:33,425
Bye, now.

1526
01:44:18,386 --> 01:44:19,679
Hello, Reggie.

1527
01:44:20,432 --> 01:44:21,725
How are you?

1528
01:44:22,310 --> 01:44:23,475
Yeah, you alright, Frank?

1529
01:44:23,643 --> 01:44:26,438
Long time no see, ey?
Yeah, I'm walking straight, y'know?

1530
01:44:26,502 --> 01:44:29,465
Oh yeah?- Yeah.- That's nice, innit?

1531
01:44:30,442 --> 01:44:31,691
That's nice.

1532
01:44:32,276 --> 01:44:33,653
What can I do for you?

1533
01:44:34,738 --> 01:44:36,156
Frances here?

1534
01:44:37,905 --> 01:44:39,747
It's just that, y'know,
I've been outside

1535
01:44:39,759 --> 01:44:41,745
your parent's house the
last couple of weeks.

1536
01:44:41,909 --> 01:44:44,872
They haven't told me that
she left so I, y'know...

1537
01:44:45,497 --> 01:44:48,292
I've been standing underneath
her her window like a fool.

1538
01:44:50,754 --> 01:44:53,381
Yeah, she's here.
Yeah, I know.

1539
01:44:55,050 --> 01:44:57,385
Reggie, I...
What?

1540
01:45:00,095 --> 01:45:03,267
I haven't seen her like
this in a long time.

1541
01:45:04,268 --> 01:45:06,770
She's delicate.
Right.

1542
01:45:06,934 --> 01:45:08,757
Alright. Well you tell
Frances to come out

1543
01:45:08,769 --> 01:45:10,774
here. I want her to come out here.
Go get her.

1544
01:45:10,838 --> 01:45:13,717
Reggie, I'm not going to let you see her, alright.
Don't fuck about.

1545
01:45:14,985 --> 01:45:17,403
Frances, go back inside.
What are you doing?

1546
01:45:17,415 --> 01:45:19,575
Do not worry. It's OK.
Hello, Reggie.

1547
01:45:20,656 --> 01:45:22,126
Hello, Frances.

1548
01:45:24,412 --> 01:45:27,955
Have you got a moment?
So that we can chat?

1549
01:45:28,023 --> 01:45:29,877
It's alright.
Are you sure about this?

1550
01:45:31,879 --> 01:45:34,169
Go in, son. Go put a kettle on.

1551
01:45:37,425 --> 01:45:38,926
Frankie, come home.

1552
01:45:40,051 --> 01:45:41,553
I am home.

1553
01:45:42,761 --> 01:45:46,766
At least until I find somewhere else.
I can't go and live with my mum.

1554
01:45:48,444 --> 01:45:51,015
Well what can I do to change your mind?

1555
01:45:51,879 --> 01:45:53,316
You can't.

1556
01:45:55,651 --> 01:45:58,614
I've changed my mind about one
thing, though. What's that?

1557
01:45:59,655 --> 01:46:04,452
I do want you to remember me... always.

1558
01:46:05,453 --> 01:46:09,625
That I existed... that I once walked
beside you. What are you on about?

1559
01:46:10,417 --> 01:46:11,919
Frankie, come on.

1560
01:46:12,920 --> 01:46:16,672
I always imagined... I thought that
we might have a child or two, y'know?

1561
01:46:17,713 --> 01:46:20,760
Why?
So you could use them to threaten me?

1562
01:46:20,928 --> 01:46:22,217
No.

1563
01:46:23,218 --> 01:46:24,848
Because I still love you.

1564
01:46:25,641 --> 01:46:28,495
No. No, it's just a thing
you say out of loyalty for

1565
01:46:28,507 --> 01:46:31,102
something that didn't
exist in the first place.

1566
01:46:31,170 --> 01:46:35,067
Not true. Loving you is the only
thing that holds me together.

1567
01:46:39,947 --> 01:46:44,908
Y'know, I dreamt that we could live
beyond the place that we were meant for.

1568
01:46:46,994 --> 01:46:49,973
But you're a gangster
and you love being one.

1569
01:46:50,245 --> 01:46:53,669
No. No, Frances, listen.

1570
01:46:55,795 --> 01:47:01,340
Please let me make amends for the suffering
and the pain that I have cause you. Please.

1571
01:47:02,177 --> 01:47:03,342
Please.

1572
01:47:05,428 --> 01:47:07,222
Just let me take you somewhere.

1573
01:47:07,931 --> 01:47:12,103
Somewhere?
Yeah, anywhere. Anywhere you want.

1574
01:47:13,352 --> 01:47:16,107
Yeah, just the two of us.
So we can be together.

1575
01:47:17,733 --> 01:47:19,610
It'll be like our second honeymoon.

1576
01:47:20,443 --> 01:47:24,571
Or not. Just so that you can
know that I can change.

1577
01:47:26,241 --> 01:47:28,743
To be fair, I have... I've changed.

1578
01:47:32,331 --> 01:47:38,045
All I'm saying is that the center of the
world can be anywhere you want it to be.

1579
01:47:38,629 --> 01:47:39,879
Anywhere.

1580
01:47:41,172 --> 01:47:43,510
Ibiza.
Who?

1581
01:47:43,658 --> 01:47:47,887
Ibiza. Let's go there.
I like the way the word sounds.

1582
01:47:48,055 --> 01:47:50,805
Yeah. You know what? I like
the way the words sounds too.

1583
01:47:51,474 --> 01:47:56,811
You want to go to Ibiza?
I'll get the tickets today. I'll book them today.

1584
01:48:50,365 --> 01:48:53,244
<i>God doesn't ask if we accept this life.</i>

1585
01:48:53,536 --> 01:48:56,999
<i>There is no choice.
Life is forced upon you.</i>

1586
01:48:57,540 --> 01:49:03,089
<i>The only choice is how you live it.
Or not. That's a choice as well.</i>

1587
01:49:19,730 --> 01:49:21,933
<i>A cup of tea can solve anything.</i>

1588
01:49:22,397 --> 01:49:28,070
<i>A bit under the weather? Tea. You've left
your husband? Tea is the answer.</i>

1589
01:49:28,238 --> 01:49:31,240
Frances, no Frances. What
have you done? Frances!

1590
01:49:31,906 --> 01:49:34,665
<i>In case you thought, "at
least Frances survived</i>

1591
01:49:34,677 --> 01:49:36,995
<i>or she wouldn't be telling
us this tale."</i>

1592
01:49:37,247 --> 01:49:39,374
<i>Well, now you know.</i>

1593
01:49:40,166 --> 01:49:44,919
<i>But I was free at last.
God finally cut me some slack.</i>

1594
01:49:45,087 --> 01:49:46,505
Where is she?

1595
01:49:47,742 --> 01:49:49,075
In her bedroom.

1596
01:50:51,862 --> 01:50:55,866
<i>That afternoon Reggie would
drink himself insensible.</i>

1597
01:50:56,703 --> 01:51:00,083
<i>What do you do after
all, when the only person</i>

1598
01:51:00,095 --> 01:51:02,709
<i>who could ever get to you is gone?</i>

1599
01:51:03,125 --> 01:51:06,837
<i>A cup of tea?
I don't think so.</i>

1600
01:52:30,540 --> 01:52:32,239
One big hat.

1601
01:52:34,314 --> 01:52:38,047
Go on, sit down. Don't stand around there
looking like some kind of lamppost.

1602
01:52:42,363 --> 01:52:43,576
Squeeze in.

1603
01:52:43,845 --> 01:52:49,802
Sweat it. What don't we have. A bottle.
Go on. Go on, Gordon.

1604
01:52:56,619 --> 01:52:59,069
You wanted to see me, Ron?
Yeah, I do actually.

1605
01:52:59,138 --> 01:53:03,572
I want you to kill someone for me, alright?
I'm going to give you a thousand pounds.

1606
01:53:04,067 --> 01:53:05,364
Leslie.

1607
01:53:08,150 --> 01:53:11,666
There's 500 there, right, so that's half.

1608
01:53:11,930 --> 01:53:14,238
Yeah? You get the rest when it's done.

1609
01:53:14,576 --> 01:53:18,765
You count it all, cos it's all there.
And you can put it in your little pocket.

1610
01:53:20,278 --> 01:53:21,744
That's for you.

1611
01:53:22,330 --> 01:53:26,013
Go on, put it in your fucking pocket.
We know you ain't got any money.

1612
01:53:26,825 --> 01:53:28,238
Don't be daft.

1613
01:53:31,415 --> 01:53:32,619
Who is it?

1614
01:54:01,503 --> 01:54:03,160
Mum, wait here.

1615
01:54:14,079 --> 01:54:15,759
Stop, Mum. Leave it.
You killed her.

1616
01:54:15,893 --> 01:54:19,535
You killed my daughter, you bastard.
You killed her.

1617
01:54:21,543 --> 01:54:24,831
<i>Spending a hundred
pounds a week on flowers</i>

1618
01:54:24,843 --> 01:54:27,190
<i>won't bring her back. Murderer.</i>

1619
01:54:27,358 --> 01:54:31,916
<i>You'll fucking rot in hell, Reggie Kray.</i>

1620
01:55:15,883 --> 01:55:18,016
McVitie, what are you doing here?

1621
01:55:18,393 --> 01:55:21,823
I've got a message for you... from Ron.

1622
01:55:33,453 --> 01:55:34,626
Back.

1623
01:56:09,104 --> 01:56:11,782
Shall I send a solicitor
or have you seen to that?

1624
01:56:15,537 --> 01:56:19,421
I want my wife and children's
safety guaranteed.

1625
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:32,813
Payne.

1626
01:56:33,717 --> 01:56:35,532
He's given them everything.

1627
01:56:35,950 --> 01:56:40,174
Names, dates, times.

1628
01:56:40,636 --> 01:56:43,062
Documents, the lot.

1629
01:56:45,239 --> 01:56:47,455
They'll put two and two together...

1630
01:56:48,737 --> 01:56:51,396
and send a dozen witnesses
into protection.

1631
01:56:54,945 --> 01:56:56,451
Nipper, uh...

1632
01:56:59,712 --> 01:57:01,636
Yeah, Nipper, what?

1633
01:57:04,994 --> 01:57:09,721
The barmaid. He got the barmaid back in.

1634
01:57:11,938 --> 01:57:13,684
She ain't coming out.

1635
01:57:19,583 --> 01:57:21,089
Where's Ron?

1636
01:57:28,293 --> 01:57:29,203
Oh, yeah.

1637
01:57:34,592 --> 01:57:39,030
This is a piece of of me, this.
Oh yeah. I love this song.

1638
01:57:39,194 --> 01:57:40,498
It's your favorite.

1639
01:57:54,052 --> 01:57:56,900
Oh fuck it, everybody...

1640
01:57:57,157 --> 01:57:58,361
What?

1641
01:57:59,325 --> 01:58:02,337
He still goes through, Ian. Oy.

1642
01:58:03,434 --> 01:58:06,316
What?
Don't get him started.

1643
01:58:06,842 --> 01:58:09,978
Fuck it.
Well, thank you for asking.

1644
01:58:14,603 --> 01:58:18,881
Cheer up, twinkletoes.
It's nearly Christmas.

1645
01:58:19,498 --> 01:58:21,664
Why don't you have a little
dance or something, y'know?

1646
01:58:23,972 --> 01:58:26,450
What is the point of
coming out to a party like

1647
01:58:26,462 --> 01:58:28,952
this... if you're not
going to enjoy yourself?

1648
01:58:29,996 --> 01:58:32,097
I'm waiting for Jack the Hat.

1649
01:58:33,803 --> 01:58:36,322
Oh, right. What's he been doing?
Has he been

1650
01:58:36,334 --> 01:58:38,978
waving his shotgun around
in the clubs again?

1651
01:58:39,696 --> 01:58:43,126
What did you think going after
Leslie Payne was going to get us?

1652
01:58:43,359 --> 01:58:46,499
What do I think?
You heard.

1653
01:58:47,694 --> 01:58:52,923
Well in case you ain't realized, I don't
fucking answer to you, sweetheart.

1654
01:58:57,861 --> 01:59:01,048
There he is. Come on. C'mon, Ron, show
us that stuff. I've got the moves.

1655
01:59:03,081 --> 01:59:06,111
Hello, hello. Where the birds at?
It's Jack the Hat.

1656
01:59:06,479 --> 01:59:08,980
Mr. Bender, how are ya?
Nice to see you.

1657
01:59:10,604 --> 01:59:11,792
Esther?
Jackie.

1658
01:59:11,825 --> 01:59:14,395
I should never have let you go,
that was an absolute mistake.

1659
01:59:14,420 --> 01:59:17,416
I'm going to get myself a drink.
And then I'm going to come back

1660
01:59:17,428 --> 01:59:20,205
and I'll tell you why I shouldn't
have let you go. Promise.

1661
01:59:27,052 --> 01:59:28,221
Ron.

1662
01:59:35,566 --> 01:59:36,699
Teddy.

1663
01:59:37,783 --> 01:59:43,241
Hang on, Ron, look. Jack's here.
What's your story this morning, Dorice.

1664
01:59:51,977 --> 01:59:56,828
Here, Jack. A cigarette.
I quit on the way down the stairs.

1665
02:00:04,711 --> 02:00:06,919
You got something on your mind, Reg?

1666
02:00:07,422 --> 02:00:11,310
Yeah. Yeah, you're on my mind, mate.

1667
02:00:12,205 --> 02:00:13,878
Leslie Payne?

1668
02:00:15,595 --> 02:00:17,727
What the fuck were you thinking?

1669
02:00:19,780 --> 02:00:21,288
Ey? You've ruined this.

1670
02:00:22,152 --> 02:00:25,208
I don't know what you're on about.
Don't fucking lie to me.

1671
02:00:27,499 --> 02:00:29,063
I'm not going to fucking
let me be treated this

1672
02:00:29,075 --> 02:00:30,519
way. - How do you want
to be treated, Jack?

1673
02:00:30,584 --> 02:00:33,072
Ron?- Shut up.
He ain't going to fucking help you, is he?

1674
02:00:33,140 --> 02:00:34,995
You've got a tin of worms
in your head, mate.

1675
02:00:35,064 --> 02:00:37,783
Don't take it out on me
what happened to Frances.

1676
02:00:38,553 --> 02:00:39,775
What's that? What did you say?

1677
02:00:40,233 --> 02:00:42,215
It's not my fault
that Frances killed

1678
02:00:42,227 --> 02:00:44,640
herself. I never sold
her the fucking pills.

1679
02:00:44,709 --> 02:00:47,314
Oh, you've got to be joking.
Are you fucking joking? Reggie.

1680
02:00:47,683 --> 02:00:49,269
Go on.
Fucking shoot him.

1681
02:00:49,406 --> 02:00:52,458
Say that again, go on.
Reggie.

1682
02:00:52,727 --> 02:00:55,872
Say her fucking name.
I dare you.

1683
02:01:01,510 --> 02:01:03,446
Frances.

1684
02:01:41,405 --> 02:01:43,662
Why would you do that?

1685
02:01:48,111 --> 02:01:53,077
Because I can't kill you, no matter
how much I fucking want to.

1686
02:02:24,184 --> 02:02:25,481
<i>Reggie?</i>

1687
02:02:28,208 --> 02:02:31,065
Reggie?

1688
02:02:31,769 --> 02:02:35,168
Reg, look at me.
What the fuck's wrong with you?

1689
02:02:35,670 --> 02:02:40,539
You kill a geezer in a room full of people.
Are you fucking mad?

1690
02:02:42,340 --> 02:02:43,553
Ey?
Ey, what?

1691
02:04:01,146 --> 02:04:04,616
<i>Reggie once said that the center of the
world could be anywhere you like.</i>

1692
02:04:05,018 --> 02:04:07,862
<i>Even here, in the East End of London.</i>

1693
02:04:08,430 --> 02:04:14,147
<i>The world is quite like London. It's not
good. It's not bad. It just is.</i>

1694
02:04:14,616 --> 02:04:18,756
<i>There's no morality or dishonor.
Just your own lonely code...</i>

1695
02:04:18,825 --> 02:04:22,130
<i>until your race is run.
Until the end.</i>

1696
02:04:22,395 --> 02:04:26,327
<i>Until we're all just ghosts of the
people we once thought we were.</i>

1697
02:04:48,074 --> 02:04:51,713
<i>Reggie spent 33 years in prison
for killing Jack McVitie.</i>

1698
02:04:52,315 --> 02:04:57,610
<i>Through all of those years, until the end,
he carried a pair of tickets with him.</i>

1699
02:04:57,728 --> 02:05:03,394
<i>Reggie, my prince. We were supposed
to go to Ibiza, after all.</i>
