1
00:00:26,411 --> 00:00:28,276
Sharon!

2
00:00:28,913 --> 00:00:30,676
She's not here.

3
00:00:30,882 --> 00:00:34,750
Oh, God.
Christopher, can you see anything?

4
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:36,450
Sharon!

5
00:00:36,654 --> 00:00:39,384
- Sharon!
- She's there.

6
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,755
Sharon!

7
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,225
Honey!

8
00:00:50,468 --> 00:00:52,095
Sharon!

9
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:55,496
Wait for Mommy!

10
00:01:15,326 --> 00:01:16,520
Sharon!

11
00:01:22,934 --> 00:01:24,333
Wait.

12
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,180
Sharon! Honey!

13
00:01:50,795 --> 00:01:53,787
Oh, my God. Sharon!

14
00:01:53,998 --> 00:01:55,465
Home.

15
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,808
Home.

16
00:02:11,015 --> 00:02:12,573
No!

17
00:02:20,158 --> 00:02:22,319
- Home! Home!
- We're going home.

18
00:02:22,527 --> 00:02:24,358
Silent Hill!

19
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:27,224
- Silent Hill!
- Rose!

20
00:02:27,431 --> 00:02:29,365
- Wake up.
- Hey.

21
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:32,229
- It's okay, sweetie. We're here now.
- It's okay. It's okay.

22
00:02:32,436 --> 00:02:33,926
It's okay.

23
00:02:35,373 --> 00:02:37,864
It's okay, baby.
We're going right home.

24
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:40,703
- What are we gonna do?
- We'll get there.

25
00:02:40,912 --> 00:02:43,779
We'll find a way through this.
We'll find a way.

26
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:45,573
No.

27
00:02:46,184 --> 00:02:49,381
- She said it again.
- I know.

28
00:02:51,055 --> 00:02:55,185
- Come on, baby. It's okay.
- Calm down, baby. It's okay.

29
00:02:55,393 --> 00:02:56,917
- It's okay, baby.
- We're right here.

30
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:02,531
It's okay.

31
00:03:03,901 --> 00:03:05,459
It's okay.

32
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:09,670
It's okay, baby.

33
00:03:12,688 --> 00:03:21,388
SILENT HILL

34
00:03:36,834 --> 00:03:39,826
- Wanna see?
- Sure.

35
00:03:40,037 --> 00:03:42,471
What are you doing there, pumpkin?

36
00:03:46,077 --> 00:03:49,740
This is an amazing lion.
Did you do that all by yourself?

37
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:52,646
I'm so impressed with you, honey.

38
00:03:59,523 --> 00:04:04,119
Hey, you know we're going
on a special trip, don't you?

39
00:04:04,929 --> 00:04:07,056
Do you know where we're going?

40
00:04:08,566 --> 00:04:10,033
No?

41
00:04:10,234 --> 00:04:13,795
Honey, sometimes when you go
to sleep, you go on a little walk.

42
00:04:14,005 --> 00:04:17,236
And sometimes
you talk about a place...

43
00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:20,304
...called Silent Hill.

44
00:04:21,913 --> 00:04:24,245
I don't remember.

45
00:04:24,749 --> 00:04:26,580
Oh, that's okay, sweetie.

46
00:04:26,784 --> 00:04:30,618
That's why we're gonna go there,
so you can remember.

47
00:04:39,563 --> 00:04:41,758
Daddy's not coming?

48
00:04:43,801 --> 00:04:45,860
No, sweetie.
It's gonna be just you and me.

49
00:05:30,514 --> 00:05:32,448
Break's over, sweetie.

50
00:05:33,384 --> 00:05:34,908
You awake?

51
00:05:36,153 --> 00:05:37,848
You wanna go?

52
00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:49,849
Do you not know that we will judge angels?
Do you not know that the saints will judge the world?

53
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,850
Corinthians 6:2-3

54
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,065
Damn it, Rose. What's going on?

55
00:06:02,513 --> 00:06:04,413
<i>Hi, this is Rose Da Silva.</i>

56
00:06:04,882 --> 00:06:08,340
<i>Please leave a message,
and I'll call you back.</i>

57

GHOST TOWN OF AMERICA

58
00:06:25,988 --> 00:06:27,003
SILENT HILL
WEST VIRGINIA

59
00:06:27,088 --> 00:06:28,198
Oh, no, Rose.

60
00:06:34,888 --> 00:06:38,089
Silent Hill: The Tainted Town

61
00:07:50,054 --> 00:07:52,113
Honey, you're awake?

62
00:07:52,323 --> 00:07:53,517
Long drive.

63
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:56,056
Can I ask you something, sweetie?

64
00:07:58,462 --> 00:08:00,896
Why did you change your pictures?

65
00:08:03,467 --> 00:08:05,094
I didn't.

66
00:08:05,302 --> 00:08:07,327
- Mommy?
- You can't remember?

67
00:08:07,538 --> 00:08:10,735
No. I don't like that, Mommy.

68
00:08:10,941 --> 00:08:14,502
- Baby, you can't remember doing this?
- Who did that?

69
00:08:14,712 --> 00:08:17,738
- Hey, hey, baby, it's okay.
- Mommy, who did that?

70
00:08:17,948 --> 00:08:20,109
It's okay, honey. Mommy's here.

71
00:08:21,619 --> 00:08:23,746
Can you wait in the car for me?

72
00:08:23,954 --> 00:08:26,388
Can I sit in front?

73
00:08:27,024 --> 00:08:30,323
- Of course you can sit in the front.
- Okay.

74
00:08:42,873 --> 00:08:45,171
Jimmy, we need
a ham and cheese on white.

75
00:08:45,376 --> 00:08:46,809
Hi.

76
00:08:47,878 --> 00:08:50,540
I just wanna pay for the gas.

77
00:08:50,748 --> 00:08:53,808
And can you tell me the best way
to get to Silent Hill?

78
00:08:54,018 --> 00:08:56,987
I can't seem to find it on the map.

79
00:08:57,188 --> 00:09:00,646
- Why do you wanna go there?
- I...I read about it.

80
00:09:01,292 --> 00:09:03,624
Road don't go through no more.

81
00:09:04,328 --> 00:09:06,523
Your card was declined.

82
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,458
Hey there.

83
00:09:11,735 --> 00:09:16,229
- Is everything all right?
- Don't talk to strangers.

84
00:09:17,908 --> 00:09:19,307
Good girl.

85
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,536
All right. Well, thanks for your help.

86
00:09:27,218 --> 00:09:28,913
Why did you cut off the cards?

87
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:31,144
<i>That's not gonna stop me
from taking her there.</i>

88
00:09:31,355 --> 00:09:34,290
Listen, honey,
we gotta put Sharon in a hospital.

89
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,786
<i>She needs constant care,
and she needs medication.</i>

90
00:09:37,294 --> 00:09:39,694
The medication doesn't work.

91
00:09:39,897 --> 00:09:42,491
She's getting worse every day.

92
00:09:43,267 --> 00:09:46,361
Honey, the adoption people said
Sharon came from West Virginia...

93
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:49,105
<i>...and Silent Hill is in West Virginia.</i>

94
00:09:49,306 --> 00:09:51,137
<i>I'm not giving up on her, Chris.
I'm not.</i>

95
00:09:51,342 --> 00:09:53,276
Have you actually read
the websites, Rose?

96
00:09:53,477 --> 00:09:56,207
<i>Yes, Chris, I read them.</i>

97
00:09:56,413 --> 00:09:59,974
Just trust me on this, please?
Just trust me on this.

98
00:10:00,818 --> 00:10:01,785
<i>Listen, honey...</i>

99
00:10:01,986 --> 00:10:05,478
<i>- I love Sharon every bit as much as I...
- Chris, I gotta go.</i>

100
00:10:07,658 --> 00:10:09,353
...I love you.

101
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,189
- Need any help, ma'am?
- No, we're...We're fine, thanks.

102
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,527
We're fine.

103
00:11:33,377 --> 00:11:35,368
Are we there?

104
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:37,938
Not yet, honey.

105
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,260
Keep your seatbelt fastened.

106
00:11:53,464 --> 00:11:54,795
Hey!

107
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,513
Mommy!

108
00:12:47,918 --> 00:12:50,443
It's okay. It's just the radio.

109
00:12:50,654 --> 00:12:52,849
- I'm turning it off.
- Mommy!

110
00:13:44,374 --> 00:13:45,568
Sharon?

111
00:13:52,282 --> 00:13:53,909
Sharon!

112
00:13:55,385 --> 00:13:57,615
Somebody! Help!

113
00:13:58,088 --> 00:13:59,783
Please!

114
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:04,823
We've had an accident!

115
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,534
Anybody!

116
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:22,506
Sharon. Honey.

117
00:14:35,225 --> 00:14:36,749
Ashes.

118
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,188
WELCOME TO SILENT HILL

119
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,459
Sharon!

120
00:15:57,674 --> 00:15:58,663
Sharon!

121
00:15:59,476 --> 00:16:01,103
Wait!

122
00:16:01,612 --> 00:16:03,011
Sharon!

123
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:04,703
Wait!

124
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:29,535
Sharon!

125
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:35,439
Sharon?

126
00:16:42,552 --> 00:16:44,110
Honey?

127
00:17:31,868 --> 00:17:33,062
What's happening?

128
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:41,838
<i>Mommy.</i>

129
00:17:43,346 --> 00:17:45,007
Sharon.

130
00:18:19,983 --> 00:18:21,780
Sharon?

131
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:36,495
Sharon?

132
00:19:03,927 --> 00:19:05,326
Hello?

133
00:19:27,284 --> 00:19:28,478
Wait!

134
00:19:31,454 --> 00:19:32,785
Sharon.

135
00:19:32,989 --> 00:19:34,616
Sharon.

136
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,018
Sharon.

137
00:20:14,698 --> 00:20:16,495
Help me!

138
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:21,603
Help.

139
00:20:22,005 --> 00:20:24,473
Help me. Help.

140
00:20:24,674 --> 00:20:27,370
Someone! Shit!

141
00:20:31,381 --> 00:20:34,077
Get off me! Get off!

142
00:21:07,484 --> 00:21:08,849
Get off! Get off!

143
00:21:09,052 --> 00:21:10,349
Get off me!

144
00:21:10,553 --> 00:21:13,249
No! Get off me!

145
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:17,823
No! Get off me! Get off me!

146
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,541
Get off...!

147
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:30,589
Only the dark one opens
and closes the door to Silent Hill.

148
00:23:30,794 --> 00:23:32,352
Please.

149
00:23:33,763 --> 00:23:37,164
I don't know what's happening.
Do you know what's going on here?

150
00:23:39,235 --> 00:23:40,896
My daughter.

151
00:23:41,438 --> 00:23:44,100
I'm looking for my daughter.
I'm afraid that she's been hurt.

152
00:23:44,307 --> 00:23:46,673
We've all lost our children.

153
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,741
Our light.

154
00:23:49,746 --> 00:23:51,714
They deceived me.

155
00:23:51,915 --> 00:23:53,314
Their evil.

156
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:56,045
Their hate.

157
00:23:58,455 --> 00:24:00,548
They hurt my child.

158
00:24:00,757 --> 00:24:02,725
They did terrible things to her.

159
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,721
Alessa.

160
00:24:07,764 --> 00:24:09,959
This is my daughter, Sharon.

161
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:12,066
She sleepwalks,
so you have to be careful...

162
00:24:12,268 --> 00:24:17,399
...but if you see her,
please, tell her to wait for me.

163
00:24:17,841 --> 00:24:20,537
Yes, she's mine.

164
00:24:20,743 --> 00:24:21,903
- It was mine.
- It's mine.

165
00:24:22,112 --> 00:24:23,943
- It's mine.
- It's mine!

166
00:24:24,147 --> 00:24:25,944
- It's mine!
- Get off me!

167
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:37,285
lnto the fire
she swallowed their hate.

168
00:25:05,522 --> 00:25:08,013
- Hi there.
- Yeah.

169
00:25:09,893 --> 00:25:13,420
Listen, my wife,
she came through here last night.

170
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:16,326
- Maybe you saw her?
- Daughter worked night shift.

171
00:25:18,501 --> 00:25:23,598
Actually, she was heading
for this place, Silent Hill.

172
00:25:23,806 --> 00:25:25,967
- How do I get there?
- You don't.

173
00:25:26,176 --> 00:25:28,144
Town's closed down
because of the coal fire...

174
00:25:28,344 --> 00:25:30,835
...still burning underground,
you know?

175
00:25:31,047 --> 00:25:33,572
Breathe enough of them fumes,
oh, bound to kill you.

176
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:38,109
Okay...

177
00:25:39,656 --> 00:25:41,647
...where's the turnoff?

178
00:25:54,737 --> 00:25:56,432
Sharon?

179
00:26:28,471 --> 00:26:29,938
Come on.

180
00:26:37,113 --> 00:26:40,674
<i>Hi, this is Chris.
Please leave a message.</i>

181
00:26:40,883 --> 00:26:42,851
Christopher, it's me.

182
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:47,011
I'm in Silent Hill.
I'm sorry, I made a mistake.

183
00:26:47,223 --> 00:26:49,487
Sharon's lost,
but I think I know where she is...

184
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:52,957
...so I'm going to the school
to look for her.

185
00:26:53,997 --> 00:26:56,659
I'm not okay, all right?
I need your help.

186
00:26:56,866 --> 00:27:00,529
Please, please, hurry.

187
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:04,397
Fuck. Come on!

188
00:27:04,607 --> 00:27:07,041
Ma'am, I want you to put
both hands on the wheel.

189
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:12,213
Put both hands on the wheel.

190
00:27:14,417 --> 00:27:16,214
Where's the little girl, ma'am?

191
00:27:16,819 --> 00:27:20,016
Please, my daughter, she's gone.
I need your help.

192
00:27:20,223 --> 00:27:22,191
- Get out of the car.
- What?

193
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:23,916
Move it.

194
00:27:25,161 --> 00:27:26,788
Jesus, what are you doing?

195
00:27:26,996 --> 00:27:29,089
- You're under arrest.
- What?

196
00:27:29,299 --> 00:27:32,291
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

197
00:27:32,502 --> 00:27:35,266
I don't think you understand.
There's something weird going on.

198
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:36,995
My daughter, she's in danger.

199
00:27:37,206 --> 00:27:39,299
If you really cared,
you wouldn't have sped off.

200
00:27:39,509 --> 00:27:41,739
Listen to me, she 's ill.
She sleepwalks.

201
00:27:41,944 --> 00:27:44,310
Just calm right down.
I'm gonna find the little girl.

202
00:27:46,683 --> 00:27:49,015
Officer Bennett to base, over.

203
00:27:50,987 --> 00:27:53,217
Base, do you copy, over?

204
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:56,318
- Shit.
- You're bleeding.

205
00:28:00,997 --> 00:28:02,794
Cracked my head on the road
pretty good...

206
00:28:02,999 --> 00:28:06,457
...when my bike went down.
I must have been out for a while.

207
00:28:06,903 --> 00:28:10,168
- You all right to walk?
- Sure.

208
00:28:10,406 --> 00:28:13,000
Then it looks like we'll be
hiking back to Brahams.

209
00:28:13,209 --> 00:28:14,506
What?

210
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:17,507
You're going back to the station.

211
00:28:17,714 --> 00:28:19,841
- Are you kidding?
- Nope.

212
00:28:20,683 --> 00:28:22,378
Have you heard
a single word I've said?

213
00:28:22,585 --> 00:28:24,143
- Yeah, I hear you.
- Have you heard...

214
00:28:24,354 --> 00:28:25,844
...a single word I've said?

215
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:29,451
I'm sure she's at the school,
we just need to turn around...

216
00:28:29,659 --> 00:28:32,457
<i>...Silent Hill...
...sorry...</i>

217
00:28:32,662 --> 00:28:34,220
<i>...Sharon...
...lost...</i>

218
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:40,027
<i>...think I know where...
...going to the school to look for her...</i>

219
00:28:40,236 --> 00:28:41,703
<i>I'm not okay...</i>

220
00:28:41,904 --> 00:28:46,102
<i>I need your...Your help.
Please, hurry!</i>

221
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,624
Sorry, sir, this road is closed.
You'll have to turn around.

222
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:09,662
I'm looking for my wife.
She may have come through here.

223
00:29:10,533 --> 00:29:14,902
She drives a Jeep Liberty.
Silver, Ohio plates.

224
00:29:15,805 --> 00:29:19,468
Sir, this man's wife
was driving the Jeep.

225
00:29:20,443 --> 00:29:21,410
<i>Bring him down.</i>

226
00:29:21,611 --> 00:29:23,238
- Come on.
- You've seen her?

227
00:29:29,786 --> 00:29:30,844
Where is she?

228
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:33,921
lnspector Thomas Gucci.
Enjoying the weather, are you?

229
00:29:34,123 --> 00:29:36,353
For God's sake,
I'm trying to find my wife.

230
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:37,787
I know. Hang on a second.

231
00:29:37,994 --> 00:29:40,360
Now, that vehicle you were
talking about, we found it.

232
00:29:40,563 --> 00:29:42,793
It's at the end of the bridge here,
but it's empty.

233
00:29:42,999 --> 00:29:45,490
We've got no indication
anyone's come under any harm.

234
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:47,498
- Good Christ.
- Now, you mind telling me...

235
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:49,671
...what your wife's doing
up here, Mr...?

236
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:51,965
- Da Silva, Chris Da Silva.
- My pleasure, Chris...

237
00:29:52,175 --> 00:29:54,837
The faster we start looking,
the faster we're gonna find her.

238
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:57,512
All right, hold your horses,
hold your horses, Chris.

239
00:29:57,713 --> 00:29:59,772
I've also got a missing deputy.

240
00:29:59,982 --> 00:30:02,075
And knowing Officer Cybil Bennett
the way I do...

241
00:30:02,285 --> 00:30:05,049
...she's probably out there looking
for your wife and daughter.

242
00:30:05,254 --> 00:30:07,552
Bobby, make sure no one
comes through that barricade.

243
00:30:07,757 --> 00:30:09,657
We're gonna get our asses up
to Silent Hill.

244
00:30:09,859 --> 00:30:11,417
- Let's take a look around.
- Yes, sir.

245
00:30:11,627 --> 00:30:13,492
While Chris here tells me
what's going on.

246
00:30:15,565 --> 00:30:18,193
She disappeared yesterday.
I spoke to her...

247
00:30:18,401 --> 00:30:20,062
...when she stopped for gas
in Brahams.

248
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:23,170
Why were you coming up here
in the middle of the night?

249
00:30:23,372 --> 00:30:26,808
- I thought it would help her.
- You people. You get off the highway...

250
00:30:27,009 --> 00:30:30,638
...from whatever big city, bringing
all your sick problems with you.

251
00:30:32,482 --> 00:30:34,746
Why aren't you listening to me?

252
00:30:35,051 --> 00:30:37,349
We had a guy come up here
two years ago...

253
00:30:37,553 --> 00:30:40,818
...snatched a little boy from a rest stop,
dropped him into a mine vent.

254
00:30:41,023 --> 00:30:42,854
I never wanna see
anything like that again.

255
00:30:43,059 --> 00:30:45,857
Look, I don't know what
you're thinking, but you're not helping.

256
00:30:46,062 --> 00:30:48,223
There is no way I would ever
harm my own daughter.

257
00:30:48,431 --> 00:30:50,763
How do I even know
she is your daughter?

258
00:30:50,967 --> 00:30:52,366
Come on.

259
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,069
What the hell?

260
00:31:35,144 --> 00:31:36,839
Okay.

261
00:31:37,046 --> 00:31:39,276
Now do you see
what I'm talking about?

262
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:41,074
Will you take these handcuffs
off me?

263
00:31:41,284 --> 00:31:43,684
No. Get walking.

264
00:31:43,886 --> 00:31:46,514
There's a fire-Iookout tower
on the far side of Toluca Lake.

265
00:31:46,722 --> 00:31:49,452
- It should have a radio.
- Fuck you, you stupid cop.

266
00:31:50,092 --> 00:31:52,959
This place is completely cut off.

267
00:31:53,763 --> 00:31:56,231
- You have no idea what's going on.
- Hey!

268
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,527
Hey, you up there!

269
00:32:00,736 --> 00:32:02,829
I'm a police officer!

270
00:32:06,943 --> 00:32:08,604
What's going on?

271
00:32:16,285 --> 00:32:18,116
What is that?

272
00:32:22,592 --> 00:32:23,957
Stand back.

273
00:32:27,463 --> 00:32:29,897
Jesus Christ, shoot it.

274
00:32:42,912 --> 00:32:44,402
Stay where you are!

275
00:32:46,115 --> 00:32:47,605
Stop!

276
00:34:25,788 --> 00:34:28,788
MIDWICH ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

277

...when a wife takes a run...

291

...she takes the daughter

293

You like hauling skeletons
out of your family closet?

294

No, not all the time, but we're
driving on top of them right now.

295
00:36:58,868 --> 00:37:01,302
Coal fire's still burning
underneath.

296
00:37:01,503 --> 00:37:03,368
You see the barbershop over there?

297
00:37:03,873 --> 00:37:06,433
- Used to be my father's.
- Your father?

November '74,
when the fire caught.

300
00:37:12,648 --> 00:37:15,981
They tried to evacuate this place
as quick as they could...

301
00:37:16,185 --> 00:37:19,254
...but it was hellish, people were
dying and disappearing.

302
00:37:19,355 --> 00:37:22,017
Hell, they couldn't even find
half the bodies.

303
00:37:22,224 --> 00:37:23,816
That was the end of Silent Hill.

304
00:37:24,026 --> 00:37:27,223
These were good people,
most of them.

305

Help me! Please! Please!

326
00:46:59,568 --> 00:47:02,093
Come on! Come on!

327
00:47:16,251 --> 00:47:17,980
Rose!

328
00:47:19,588 --> 00:47:21,317
Sharon!

329
00:47:25,093 --> 00:47:27,152
Rose!

330
00:48:30,859 --> 00:48:32,451
Rose!

331
00:48:43,371 --> 00:48:45,066
Rose.

332
00:49:00,522 --> 00:49:02,752
- Rose!
- Put your mask on.

333
00:49:02,958 --> 00:49:05,586
Rose, where are you?

334
00:49:11,833 --> 00:49:14,358
- I felt her.
- You what?

335
00:49:14,569 --> 00:49:15,900
Her perfume.

336
00:49:17,272 --> 00:49:18,671
- She was here.
- Who was?

337
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:20,898
- My wife.
- She wasn't here. Put this mask on.

338
00:49:21,109 --> 00:49:23,873
- Perfume.
- Breathe. Through that mask.

339
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,974
Come on, let's go.
We're gonna go this way.

340
00:49:28,183 --> 00:49:29,980
Chris, come on.

341
00:49:31,987 --> 00:49:33,852
- She was here.
- No, no, she wasn't here.

342
00:49:34,055 --> 00:49:35,022
I know it.

343
00:49:50,805 --> 00:49:52,067
Come on.

344
00:49:52,273 --> 00:49:54,707
Come on. Let's keep looking.

345
00:50:21,636 --> 00:50:23,797
Get off! Get off! Get off!

346
00:50:37,752 --> 00:50:39,617
Get me that pipe.

347
00:50:40,522 --> 00:50:42,752
Rose, the pipe!

348
00:50:43,792 --> 00:50:45,919
Okay. Okay.

349
00:50:47,562 --> 00:50:50,258
- I got it. I got it.
- Quick, come on!

350
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,443
Can we get out of here?

351
00:51:08,016 --> 00:51:09,608
We're trapped.

352
00:51:10,218 --> 00:51:11,685
Last mag.

353
00:51:11,886 --> 00:51:14,548
- That's all the bullets you got?
- Yeah.

354
00:51:17,292 --> 00:51:18,850
Thanks.

355
00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:32,199
You hear that?

356
00:51:40,248 --> 00:51:42,113
That's him.

357
00:51:47,455 --> 00:51:49,446
Stay down! Stay down!

358
00:51:49,657 --> 00:51:51,716
Jesus Christ.

359
00:51:53,361 --> 00:51:55,226
Get down!

360
00:52:02,337 --> 00:52:03,929
Shit!

361
00:53:10,839 --> 00:53:11,828
What?

362
00:53:51,479 --> 00:53:52,810
What the fuck?

363
00:53:54,549 --> 00:53:55,516
What the fuck?

364
00:53:57,852 --> 00:54:00,548
You saw that, right?
That was real?

365
00:54:03,024 --> 00:54:04,457
What the fuck is going on?

366
00:54:04,659 --> 00:54:07,355
All right, I know this is crazy. I know.

367
00:54:07,562 --> 00:54:09,962
We gotta calm right down,
because my kid is not here...

368
00:54:10,164 --> 00:54:13,065
...and I've gotta find her
before this happens again.

369
00:54:13,868 --> 00:54:15,961
I don't even know where to start.

370
00:54:16,371 --> 00:54:18,032
I found this.

371
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:20,207
It's from a hotel.

372
00:54:20,408 --> 00:54:23,343
I don't know where it is,
but she is in this hotel.

373
00:54:24,112 --> 00:54:25,773
Hotel?

374
00:54:32,553 --> 00:54:34,612
It's gonna be okay.

375
00:54:36,357 --> 00:54:38,348
We're gonna be okay.

376
00:54:51,339 --> 00:54:53,204
Now, don't be trying
anything, all right?

377
00:54:53,408 --> 00:54:55,399
We got men up here
all night long.

378
00:54:55,610 --> 00:54:58,340
We're gonna find your wife,
we're gonna find your daughter.

379
00:54:58,546 --> 00:55:01,447
Can't have civilians
wandering around on their own.

380
00:55:02,116 --> 00:55:04,243
You're not telling me everything.

381
00:55:05,553 --> 00:55:06,850
What really happened up here?

382
00:55:07,055 --> 00:55:09,353
Just let it rest in peace.

It's here.

Faith has brought us doom.

- Hey, stop.

405
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:34,506
Think you of thee
who cast the first stone.

406
00:56:34,709 --> 00:56:37,041
Lambs without a shepherd,
shepherd without a flock.

407
00:56:37,745 --> 00:56:39,804
It's your sins which hold you here.

408
00:56:40,014 --> 00:56:41,572
- Stop your lies!
- Calm down.

409
00:56:41,783 --> 00:56:42,750
Calm down, it's okay.

410
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:45,043
- We're not gonna hurt you.
- She's gone.

411
00:56:46,054 --> 00:56:47,612
What's your name?

412
00:56:47,989 --> 00:56:51,550
Anna. My name is Anna.

413
00:56:51,759 --> 00:56:53,784
What's going on here, Anna?
Who was that?

414
00:56:53,995 --> 00:56:57,055
- I've seen her before.
- Dahlia was cast out.

415
00:56:57,265 --> 00:56:59,324
Not even the darkness wants her.

416
00:56:59,534 --> 00:57:02,128
- She's lost her daughter too.
- What?

417
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:07,672
- Sinners deserve to lose their spawn.
- What are you doing here, Anna?

418
00:57:09,477 --> 00:57:12,002
Mother needs more food.

419
00:57:12,647 --> 00:57:14,205
You mean there are
other people here?

420
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:19,319
Christabella keeps us safe.

421
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,920
- Anna.
- We take refuge in the church.

422
00:57:22,490 --> 00:57:25,357
Anna, listen to me.

423
00:57:25,927 --> 00:57:28,327
I've lost my daughter.
She's all alone.

424
00:57:28,663 --> 00:57:31,325
Can you imagine how frightened
she must feel?

425
00:57:31,532 --> 00:57:33,500
Tell me, have you seen her?

426
00:57:33,701 --> 00:57:35,066
Do you know where she is?

427
00:57:38,873 --> 00:57:41,808
If she has faith, she might survive.

428
00:57:42,009 --> 00:57:42,976
If not...

429
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:47,038
I'm taking this.

430
00:57:49,383 --> 00:57:51,078
Have you seen this?

431
00:57:51,686 --> 00:57:53,916
I've seen it at the school.

432
00:57:54,522 --> 00:57:58,288
It's on all the buildings
the elders of my elders built.

433
00:57:58,493 --> 00:58:02,953
It's a symbol of our unity,
a symbol of our faith.

434
00:58:14,408 --> 00:58:16,069
Rose, look at this.

435
00:58:18,179 --> 00:58:21,307
- What is it?
- Just like yours.

436
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:26,186
- Where did you find it?
- They're all over the floor.

437
00:58:40,468 --> 00:58:41,662
Rose.

438
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:43,994
Check this out.

439
00:58:45,873 --> 00:58:49,969
- What number did you take this from?
- 111.

440
00:58:51,979 --> 00:58:54,277

She's all we got.

- The first burning.

Burning the witch

It stopped the apocalypse.

458

I don't know.
We're in the next building.

Some factory, maybe?

466
01:03:36,497 --> 01:03:38,624

01:06:36,377 --> 01:06:38,174
Look at me.

483
01:06:39,647 --> 01:06:41,615
I'm burning.

Rose? My God.

486
01:06:50,891 --> 01:06:53,382

- Where is she?

487
01:06:57,765 --> 01:06:59,130
Grab onto it.

488
01:07:00,567 --> 01:07:04,128

- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

490
01:07:10,711 --> 01:07:12,406
What the hell
were you doing over there?

491
01:07:12,613 --> 01:07:14,103
You're gonna get yourself killed.

492
01:07:14,882 --> 01:07:16,975
I think I just saw Dahlia's daughter.

493
01:07:18,686 --> 01:07:20,381
She was the one
that brought us here.

494
01:07:20,587 --> 01:07:21,849
What are you talking about?

495
01:07:22,056 --> 01:07:24,456
She was the one
that made me crash my car.

496
01:07:25,159 --> 01:07:26,353
Alessa.

497
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:28,755
We don't say her name.

498
01:07:32,533 --> 01:07:35,058
That's the seal, isn't it, Anna?

499
01:07:36,070 --> 01:07:38,436
The symbol of your faith?

500
01:07:41,175 --> 01:07:43,370
Something terrible happened here.

501
01:07:47,614 --> 01:07:50,777
We have to leave.
We have to leave!

502
01:07:52,086 --> 01:07:54,281
- The darkness is coming!
- Let's go.

503
01:07:54,722 --> 01:07:56,314
Let's go!

504
01:08:08,135 --> 01:08:10,365
The church isn't far.

505
01:08:10,571 --> 01:08:12,471
- Run. Run!
- Rose, come on!

506
01:08:12,673 --> 01:08:14,368
Rose!

507
01:08:24,284 --> 01:08:25,911
Hurry!

508
01:08:33,093 --> 01:08:34,287
Rose.

509
01:08:34,495 --> 01:08:36,986
- Come!
- We gotta go.

510
01:08:54,648 --> 01:08:56,582
- Rose, come on.
- I've seen this.

511
01:09:08,228 --> 01:09:09,923
Rose, let's go!

512
01:09:12,032 --> 01:09:14,626
- Cybil!
- Rose, come on.

513
01:09:22,609 --> 01:09:23,576
Cybil!

514
01:09:23,777 --> 01:09:26,644
You run not towards sanctuary
but from your fears.

515
01:09:26,847 --> 01:09:29,577
Do not join the others.
They are deceivers. They are damned.

516
01:09:29,783 --> 01:09:31,341
- We gotta get inside.
- No!

517
01:09:31,552 --> 01:09:33,110
They are wolves
in the skin of sheep.

518
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:36,153
They brought about their own hell.
They'll take you with them.

519
01:09:36,356 --> 01:09:38,586
- Filth and lies!
- Hey!

520
01:09:38,792 --> 01:09:40,191
Stop it!

521
01:09:41,528 --> 01:09:44,656
Please. I've seen your daughter.
I've seen Alessa.

522
01:09:47,668 --> 01:09:50,262
- It's coming!
- She's dead, isn't she?

523
01:09:50,470 --> 01:09:52,131
Fire doesn't cleanse, it blackens.

524
01:09:52,639 --> 01:09:54,630
- Listen to me.
- Rose, hurry!

525
01:09:55,008 --> 01:09:57,067
She looks exactly like Sharon.

526
01:09:57,277 --> 01:09:59,711
She brought us here, didn't she?

527
01:10:03,450 --> 01:10:05,645
Why? What does she want?

528
01:10:05,853 --> 01:10:07,514
Evil wakes in vengeance.

529
01:10:07,721 --> 01:10:10,349
Be careful what you choose.

530
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:31,800
Rose!

531
01:11:05,913 --> 01:11:07,312
Oh, God, no.

532
01:11:29,336 --> 01:11:30,667
- Witches!
- She's evil.

533
01:11:30,871 --> 01:11:32,065
Keep away the witches!

534
01:11:35,676 --> 01:11:37,610
- No.
- Send them back!

535
01:11:38,245 --> 01:11:39,644
No.

536
01:11:40,213 --> 01:11:41,680
We're lost.

537
01:11:51,959 --> 01:11:53,426
This is a sanctuary.

538
01:12:03,503 --> 01:12:06,961
Please, Christabella,
they lured my Anna.

539
01:12:07,174 --> 01:12:09,608
They gave her to the fiend.

540
01:12:09,943 --> 01:12:13,538
Eleanor, you must remember
that Anna went against our laws.

541
01:12:13,747 --> 01:12:16,443
She went alone outside
into the devil's playground.

542
01:12:18,652 --> 01:12:21,951
She was not the responsibility
of these two strangers.

543
01:12:23,924 --> 01:12:26,051
We'll deal with them later.

544
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:33,990
Now we must pray.

545
01:12:48,955 --> 01:12:53,955
REVELATION 20:11-15

546
01:12:54,955 --> 01:12:56,355
And then I saw them...

547
01:12:56,356 --> 01:12:59,757
...from whose presence
earth and heaven fled away.

548
01:13:00,193 --> 01:13:02,787
And no home was left to them.

549
01:13:02,996 --> 01:13:05,089
And then I saw them...

550
01:13:05,298 --> 01:13:08,563
...from whose presence
earth and heaven fled away.

551
01:13:08,769 --> 01:13:11,465
And no home was left to them.

552
01:13:11,938 --> 01:13:14,668
And I saw the dead,
the great and the small...

553
01:13:14,875 --> 01:13:18,038
...and they were judged
according to their deeds.

554
01:13:18,245 --> 01:13:23,273
And I saw the dead,
the great and the small...

555
01:13:23,483 --> 01:13:26,680
...and they were judged
according to their deeds.

556
01:13:29,222 --> 01:13:33,591
And anyone's name not found
written in the book of life...

557
01:13:33,794 --> 01:13:36,957
...they will be thrown
into the lake of fire.

558
01:13:45,788 --> 01:13:47,388
Toluca County Orphanage

559
01:13:47,441 --> 01:13:50,308
And now I lay me down to sleep...

560
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:53,411
...I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

561
01:13:53,613 --> 01:13:56,081
If I should die before I wake...

562
01:13:56,616 --> 01:13:59,847
...I pray the Lord my soul to take.

563
01:14:00,053 --> 01:14:01,884
Amen.

564
01:14:02,289 --> 01:14:05,019
All right, girls, into bed.
Quickly, now.

565
01:14:05,225 --> 01:14:07,819
No better place to be
on a rainy night.

566
01:14:08,028 --> 01:14:11,395
In you go, Lindsey, thattagirl.
You've got your bear, that's a girl.

567
01:14:11,598 --> 01:14:13,998
No. No talking
after lights are out.

568
01:14:17,771 --> 01:14:19,705
Good night, children.

569
01:14:19,906 --> 01:14:21,897
And God bless.

570
01:14:25,912 --> 01:14:28,403
I'm sorry, Sister Margaret,
this really can't wait.

571
01:14:29,316 --> 01:14:31,113
I can't imagine why.

572
01:14:33,053 --> 01:14:34,850
Nine years ago...

573
01:14:35,055 --> 01:14:37,046
...a baby was left
outside this orphanage.

574
01:14:37,257 --> 01:14:39,350
My wife and I were the ones
who adopted her.

575
01:14:39,559 --> 01:14:42,357
I'm very happy for you,
Mr. Da Silva...

576
01:14:42,562 --> 01:14:46,362
...but I can't give out
information on our children.

577
01:14:47,968 --> 01:14:49,265
Look.

578
01:14:50,637 --> 01:14:53,629
That girl, she looks
exactly like my daughter.

579
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,831
I can't help you, I'm sorry.

580
01:14:56,042 --> 01:14:58,670
- It's late.
- She must be 40 now.

581
01:14:58,879 --> 01:15:00,073
Where can I find her?

582
01:15:00,947 --> 01:15:02,847
This story isn't hers alone...

583
01:15:03,049 --> 01:15:04,744
- ...but all of ours!
- You people.

584
01:15:04,951 --> 01:15:06,111
You got yourself something.

585
01:15:06,319 --> 01:15:09,288
You know what you got now, Chris?
How about breaking and entering?

586
01:15:09,489 --> 01:15:11,582
By the looks of this,
a little assault as well.

587
01:15:12,292 --> 01:15:13,987
Thank you, Thomas.

588
01:15:14,194 --> 01:15:16,822
- This can't go any farther.
- It won't, Sister.

589
01:15:18,331 --> 01:15:20,492
You know,
I have some 12-year-olds...

590
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:23,066
...who cover their tracks
better than you do.

591
01:15:23,470 --> 01:15:24,767
What's this?

592
01:15:24,971 --> 01:15:26,529
Look, Gucci, do you know her?

593
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:29,174
Is that my daughter's birth mother?

594
01:15:34,414 --> 01:15:37,850
- Look, turn around.
- What are you doing?

595
01:15:39,953 --> 01:15:42,979
I knew that girl. I did.

596
01:15:44,157 --> 01:15:46,682
I was told she didn't make it
through the night.

597
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:49,094
The night of the fire.

598
01:15:49,362 --> 01:15:51,353
The night of the big fire
in Silent Hill.

599
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:56,100
There were these people...

600
01:15:58,071 --> 01:15:59,265
...these fanatics.

601
01:15:59,472 --> 01:16:02,703
What they did
to that child was terrible.

602
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:05,639
That was 30 years ago,
and it's over now.

603
01:16:06,112 --> 01:16:07,704
Not as far as I'm concerned.

604
01:16:08,381 --> 01:16:10,406
What's it gonna be, city boy?

605
01:16:10,617 --> 01:16:13,108
I can put you in jail...

606
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:14,981
...or you can go home.

607
01:16:15,622 --> 01:16:18,318
And that's your definition of justice?

608
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:23,223
Many different forms
of justice, Chris.

609
01:16:23,964 --> 01:16:26,990
See, you've got man's, God's...

610
01:16:28,001 --> 01:16:29,901
...and even the devil's.

611
01:16:31,338 --> 01:16:34,068
Certain forms you just can't control.

612
01:16:35,041 --> 01:16:37,236
So I want you to go home now...

613
01:16:37,644 --> 01:16:39,874
...to your nice warm bed...

614
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,514
...and let me deal with this town...

615
01:16:42,716 --> 01:16:45,446
...and what has happened
over the last 30 years.

616
01:16:45,652 --> 01:16:48,416
Okay? End of story.

617
01:16:55,688 --> 01:16:59,617
DOMINE DEUS OMNIPOTENS IN CUIUS MANU

618
01:17:00,834 --> 01:17:03,234
Tell me first how you got here.

619
01:17:05,372 --> 01:17:07,840
Honestly, I don't know
how I got here.

620
01:17:08,041 --> 01:17:10,908
Right now, I've lost my little girl...

621
01:17:11,111 --> 01:17:13,739
...and all I know is that
I'm supposed to be in this church.

622
01:17:13,947 --> 01:17:15,972
Are you a person of faith?

623
01:17:16,182 --> 01:17:18,446
- I love my daughter.
- That's not what I asked.

624
01:17:18,852 --> 01:17:19,978
Who are you to judge?

625
01:17:20,186 --> 01:17:23,383
We judge because the souls of history
hang in the balance.

626
01:17:23,590 --> 01:17:25,217
Because our faith
has never failed us.

627
01:17:25,425 --> 01:17:27,859
Our faith keeps the darkness
of hell at bay.

628
01:17:28,061 --> 01:17:31,656
Then use your faith
to help me find my little girl.

629
01:17:32,299 --> 01:17:34,324
Only the demon knows where she is.

630
01:17:34,534 --> 01:17:36,764
Then tell me,
where do I find this demon?

631
01:17:38,638 --> 01:17:41,129
No one has ever returned
from the core of the darkness...

632
01:17:41,341 --> 01:17:42,740
...where the demon lies in wait.

633
01:17:42,942 --> 01:17:44,375
She's not gonna help us.
Let's go.

634
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:47,102
If you wish to face the demon
to find your daughter...

635
01:17:47,314 --> 01:17:48,508
...I won't stop you.

636
01:17:48,715 --> 01:17:51,377
- Christabella, they can't go down...
- Silence, Adam.

637
01:17:55,121 --> 01:17:57,783
Perhaps your faith will protect you.

638
01:17:58,258 --> 01:18:00,317
Perhaps not.

639
01:18:14,174 --> 01:18:16,404
If you don't wanna do this...

640
01:18:17,410 --> 01:18:19,401
...I'll understand.

641
01:18:20,613 --> 01:18:22,581
Sharon's adopted...

642
01:18:23,483 --> 01:18:24,711
...but I'm her mother.

643
01:18:24,918 --> 01:18:27,978
I knew that from the moment
I first laid eyes on her.

644
01:18:30,323 --> 01:18:32,223
She's lucky to have you.

645
01:18:33,660 --> 01:18:36,356
Mother is God in the eyes of a child.

646
01:19:47,267 --> 01:19:48,700
Quiet.

647
01:19:49,002 --> 01:19:51,527
We're in his domain now.

648
01:19:57,010 --> 01:19:59,274
Look at this map. Memorize it.

649
01:20:00,313 --> 01:20:02,440
Your memory may save your life.

650
01:20:03,850 --> 01:20:06,785
- Do you see this room?
- Yeah.

651
01:20:06,986 --> 01:20:09,682
That is where the darkness lies.

652
01:20:09,889 --> 01:20:12,289
The demon is in the bowels
of this building.

653
01:20:12,492 --> 01:20:14,858
It hides behind the face
of an innocent.

654
01:20:15,061 --> 01:20:16,358
You mean a child?

655
01:20:16,563 --> 01:20:18,827
Don't believe your eyes.
Your eyes will lie to you.

656
01:20:19,032 --> 01:20:22,092
Faith is the only truth.

657
01:20:23,169 --> 01:20:24,363
I will pray for you, Rose...

658
01:20:24,571 --> 01:20:27,836
...but I won't expect you
and your friend to return.

659
01:20:28,708 --> 01:20:30,232
Goodbye.

660
01:20:32,679 --> 01:20:34,044
Adam.

661
01:20:35,248 --> 01:20:37,739
Left. Right.

662
01:20:38,451 --> 01:20:40,783
Left. Left.

663
01:20:42,021 --> 01:20:45,923
- Right. Right. Left.
- Take them to the lower level.

664
01:20:46,125 --> 01:20:47,922
- In the basement?
- Do it, then return.

665
01:20:48,127 --> 01:20:50,493
- Left. 3A.
- But...

666
01:20:50,697 --> 01:20:52,255
- Right. 4A.
- I said, do it.

667
01:20:53,099 --> 01:20:56,591
- Left. Left. Right.
- Rose. Rose.

668
01:20:57,170 --> 01:21:01,664
- Left. Right. Left. Left.
- Rose, she's killing you.

669
01:21:01,875 --> 01:21:04,173
- Rose!
- Let me do this.

670
01:21:05,178 --> 01:21:07,339
I need to do this.

671
01:21:25,365 --> 01:21:26,923
Take this.

672
01:21:27,133 --> 01:21:30,967
They'll be drawn to the light,
but you won't be able to see without it.

673
01:21:33,806 --> 01:21:35,501
Thank you.

674
01:21:41,915 --> 01:21:44,679
- So this thing actually works?
- It will.

675
01:21:44,884 --> 01:21:46,875
If the demon wants you, it will.

676
01:21:49,088 --> 01:21:50,282
Forgive me.

677
01:21:51,691 --> 01:21:54,353
We've lived too long as scavengers.
I believe this is yours.

678
01:22:02,001 --> 01:22:04,697
Witch! Her child's
the likeness of Alessa.

679
01:22:04,904 --> 01:22:06,235
Her child's the next vessel.

680
01:22:06,439 --> 01:22:09,237
Stop her!
Don't let the witches go down!

681
01:22:14,113 --> 01:22:15,637
Come on!

682
01:22:25,224 --> 01:22:26,521
Get off her!

683
01:22:28,728 --> 01:22:30,025
Find her.

684
01:22:30,763 --> 01:22:33,425
No! Wait! Cybil!

685
01:22:33,633 --> 01:22:35,760
Cybil! Open the door!

686
01:22:58,625 --> 01:23:01,253
No!

687
01:24:29,949 --> 01:24:31,507
8A.

688
01:24:32,051 --> 01:24:36,351
7 A. Right.

689
01:24:46,466 --> 01:24:49,663
Right. 6A.

690
01:24:51,137 --> 01:24:53,037
4A.

691
01:24:54,073 --> 01:24:55,904
3A.

692
01:24:58,544 --> 01:25:01,274
Left, left. Right, right.

693
01:25:01,481 --> 01:25:04,143
Left, left.

694
01:26:18,191 --> 01:26:22,127
Okay. I can do this.

695
01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:36,100
<i>Congratulations, Rose.</i>

696
01:27:36,302 --> 01:27:37,894
<i>You're here.</i>

697
01:27:39,538 --> 01:27:41,062
<i>You did it.</i>

698
01:27:42,842 --> 01:27:47,211
<i>Your reward is the truth.</i>

699
01:27:49,949 --> 01:27:54,045
<i>Did you see that Alessa
was a good little girl?</i>

700
01:27:56,756 --> 01:28:00,248
<i>Even though nobody
looked at her that way.</i>

701
01:28:01,027 --> 01:28:06,465
<i>- Burn the witch! Burn the witch!
- Their parents told them she was bad.</i>

702
01:28:07,533 --> 01:28:10,866
<i>She didn't have a father
like they did.</i>

703
01:28:17,176 --> 01:28:20,111
<i>Alessa was alone in the world.</i>

704
01:28:24,483 --> 01:28:28,920
<i>You know what can happen
to little girls when they're left alone.</i>

705
01:28:29,089 --> 01:28:30,888
COLIN

706
01:28:32,959 --> 01:28:34,984
It's okay, it's me, come on.

707
01:28:35,194 --> 01:28:37,560
<i>Even her mother couldn't help.</i>

708
01:28:39,966 --> 01:28:42,935
<i>Even though she loved her baby.</i>

709
01:28:43,836 --> 01:28:46,737
<i>But the rest of the family
didn't love Alessa.</i>

710
01:28:46,939 --> 01:28:50,204
<i>They were just like the others
and made her scared.</i>

711
01:28:50,409 --> 01:28:52,274
We know.
Even the children know it.

712
01:28:52,478 --> 01:28:53,968
Your daughter...

713
01:28:55,314 --> 01:28:57,612
Why you won't
just name the father...

714
01:29:01,087 --> 01:29:03,749
You've brought sin amongst us.

715
01:29:03,956 --> 01:29:05,890
The faithful must gather
in judgment...

716
01:29:06,092 --> 01:29:09,152
...for we are called to purify this filth.

717
01:29:09,428 --> 01:29:11,259
What does she mean, Mommy?

718
01:29:11,831 --> 01:29:15,130
You're weak, my dear sister.
You always were.

719
01:29:15,334 --> 01:29:18,826
Trust us, Dahlia.
Have faith in our virtue.

720
01:29:19,038 --> 01:29:21,529
We will restore innocence.

721
01:29:22,208 --> 01:29:26,406
<i>They had met many times
since the town was built...</i>

722
01:29:26,612 --> 01:29:29,809
<i>...to restore innocence and purity.</i>

723
01:29:30,816 --> 01:29:33,011
<i>They had a special place for that.</i>

724
01:29:45,531 --> 01:29:47,965
<i>Do you remember the hotel?</i>

725
01:29:48,534 --> 01:29:51,298
<i>I led you to all these places...</i>

726
01:29:51,504 --> 01:29:54,940
<i>...and you were very good
at following my clues.</i>

727
01:29:55,741 --> 01:29:57,936
You may leave, Dahlia.

728
01:29:58,711 --> 01:30:00,542
We fight the sin, not the sinner.

729
01:30:01,147 --> 01:30:03,342
Mommy! Mommy!

730
01:30:04,083 --> 01:30:05,607
Mommy!

731
01:30:05,818 --> 01:30:09,117
<i>You know how that feels,
don't you, Rose?</i>

732
01:30:09,688 --> 01:30:12,020
<i>To lose your little girl?</i>

733
01:30:12,792 --> 01:30:14,885
What have I done?

734
01:30:17,463 --> 01:30:21,695
- Oh, God.
- Weep not for the demon.

735
01:30:22,268 --> 01:30:23,496
No!

736
01:30:23,702 --> 01:30:27,468
Once again
we are locked in mortal battle.

737
01:30:28,107 --> 01:30:31,668
<i>They thought they knew
how to cast out evil.</i>

738
01:30:32,845 --> 01:30:36,611
- Praise God for our clarity.
- Amen.

739
01:30:36,816 --> 01:30:41,014
Praise the innocent
for their sacrifice.

740
01:30:41,220 --> 01:30:43,188
<i>But you should be careful
how you fight evil.</i>

741
01:30:43,389 --> 01:30:46,483
- They give us back our purity.
- Purity.

742
01:30:49,662 --> 01:30:51,562
- And our unity.
- Unity.

743
01:30:51,764 --> 01:30:55,393
<i>Your weapons
can turn back on you.</i>

744
01:31:20,893 --> 01:31:22,224
No.

745
01:31:23,996 --> 01:31:25,327
No.

746
01:31:25,531 --> 01:31:28,591
<i>Now you know
why Dahlia is broken.</i>

747
01:31:30,236 --> 01:31:32,602
<i>She tried to get help...</i>

748
01:31:32,805 --> 01:31:34,932
<i>...but she went too late.</i>

749
01:31:36,342 --> 01:31:38,537
Get her up, boys.
Get her up now!

750
01:31:38,911 --> 01:31:41,175
<i>There were good people
in the town...</i>

751
01:31:41,380 --> 01:31:43,610
<i>...people like you, Rose.</i>

752
01:31:43,816 --> 01:31:46,250
<i>People who like to help.</i>

753
01:31:48,988 --> 01:31:53,322
<i>Alessa was so lonely
and hurt and scared.</i>

754
01:31:53,893 --> 01:31:56,589
<i>They should have known better
than to hurt her so badly.</i>

755
01:31:59,999 --> 01:32:02,593
<i>When you're hurt
and scared for so long...</i>

756
01:32:03,569 --> 01:32:06,003
<i>...your fear and pain turn to hate...</i>

757
01:32:06,205 --> 01:32:10,266
<i>...and the hate
starts to change the world.</i>

758
01:32:13,112 --> 01:32:18,015
<i>Alessa's hate grew and grew,
burning inside her.</i>

759
01:32:22,321 --> 01:32:24,983
<i>Her hate got so strong...</i>

760
01:32:25,591 --> 01:32:29,322
<i>...she even hurt someone
who was only curious.</i>

761
01:32:43,676 --> 01:32:45,837
<i>That's when I came.</i>

762
01:32:52,952 --> 01:32:54,886
<i>I told her it was their turn.</i>

763
01:32:56,822 --> 01:33:02,522
<i>I promised they would all
fall into her darkest dream.</i>

764
01:33:32,224 --> 01:33:36,888
<i>Now, Rose, we must talk.</i>

765
01:34:29,615 --> 01:34:31,981
Don't be afraid.

766
01:34:38,257 --> 01:34:40,157
She won't hurt you.

767
01:34:40,793 --> 01:34:42,988
She needs your help.

768
01:34:43,195 --> 01:34:44,389
Who is she?

769
01:34:45,464 --> 01:34:48,558
- She is Alessa.
- Then who are you?

770
01:34:49,001 --> 01:34:52,937
I have many names.

771
01:34:53,505 --> 01:34:57,305
Right now,
I'm the dark part of Alessa.

772
01:34:58,744 --> 01:35:00,143
Where's my child?

773
01:35:00,646 --> 01:35:03,638
She's not your child.

774
01:35:05,718 --> 01:35:07,015
She's hers.

775
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:11,817
The little girl is
what's left of her goodness.

776
01:35:12,157 --> 01:35:13,749
We hid her in safety...

777
01:35:14,827 --> 01:35:17,091
...in the world outside this hell.

778
01:35:17,192 --> 01:35:18,692
Toluca County Orphanage

779
01:35:30,008 --> 01:35:34,308
Now the dream
of this life must end...

780
01:35:34,513 --> 01:35:38,381
...and so, too,
must the dreamers within it.

781
01:35:38,584 --> 01:35:40,916
For over 30 years...

782
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:44,214
...they've lied to their own souls.

783
01:35:44,423 --> 01:35:48,655
For 30 years they've denied
their own fate.

784
01:35:48,861 --> 01:35:51,989
But now is the end of days...

785
01:35:52,197 --> 01:35:55,030
...and I am the reaper.

786
01:35:55,534 --> 01:35:57,195
What do you want?

787
01:35:57,536 --> 01:35:59,902
All we ask for is satisfaction.

788
01:36:00,539 --> 01:36:01,904
Satisfaction?

789
01:36:02,808 --> 01:36:04,708
Revenge.

790
01:36:06,545 --> 01:36:08,240
Why me?

791
01:36:08,714 --> 01:36:10,648
You chose.

792
01:36:11,116 --> 01:36:13,414
You chose Sharon.

793
01:36:13,619 --> 01:36:16,884
Christabella will find Sharon.

794
01:36:17,089 --> 01:36:19,956
She plans to purify her.

795
01:36:22,227 --> 01:36:24,218
Oh, God, no.

796
01:36:24,863 --> 01:36:28,230
Their blind conviction
repels me from their church.

797
01:36:29,034 --> 01:36:32,094
I cannot enter
while they deny their fate...

798
01:36:32,304 --> 01:36:33,771
...but you can.

799
01:36:34,673 --> 01:36:39,440
- Just tell me what I need to do.
- Tell them the truth.

800
01:37:52,317 --> 01:37:54,217
The child is mine!

801
01:37:54,419 --> 01:37:56,387
Mine!

802
01:38:01,927 --> 01:38:03,792
She's mine.

803
01:38:05,597 --> 01:38:07,462
She's mine!

804
01:38:13,472 --> 01:38:16,703
The truth is clear to those who see.

805
01:38:17,809 --> 01:38:21,404
Just as I could see
you had this child.

806
01:38:40,232 --> 01:38:41,756
Let's go.

807
01:38:44,469 --> 01:38:47,529
Out of the car. Turn around.

808
01:39:02,588 --> 01:39:04,556
Just a friendly warning...

809
01:39:05,157 --> 01:39:07,591
...I'll be back with people
who know what they're doing.

810
01:39:10,429 --> 01:39:14,160
Before you do that, Chris,
I wanna tell you about Officer Bennett.

811
01:39:15,801 --> 01:39:18,793
Few years back, some wacko,
he abducted a kid...

812
01:39:19,004 --> 01:39:22,132
...threw him down a mine vent
up there in Silent Hill.

813
01:39:22,541 --> 01:39:24,805
Cybil Bennett, she found that boy.

814
01:39:25,010 --> 01:39:26,705
She spent three days
holding onto him...

815
01:39:26,912 --> 01:39:29,107
...keeping him alive
until they were rescued.

816
01:39:29,314 --> 01:39:30,747
We know what we're doing.

817
01:39:30,949 --> 01:39:32,917
I need to do everything I can.

818
01:39:39,891 --> 01:39:41,688
Let's go.

819
01:40:05,384 --> 01:40:07,579
Please.
Christabella, let her live.

820
01:40:07,786 --> 01:40:10,016
Your weakness
led these souls to judgment.

821
01:40:10,222 --> 01:40:12,486
- This time you will bear witness.
- She is innocent.

822
01:40:12,691 --> 01:40:15,683
Look at her.
She's the whelp of your daughter.

823
01:40:15,894 --> 01:40:17,088
The demon!

824
01:40:17,663 --> 01:40:22,896
The demon fathered this disgusting
abomination from her child!

825
01:40:23,101 --> 01:40:24,125
No, she's mine!

826
01:40:27,305 --> 01:40:29,364
Sharon. Sharon, look at me.

827
01:40:29,574 --> 01:40:32,134
Look at me. Don't be afraid.

828
01:40:32,344 --> 01:40:35,836
It's okay, it's okay.
Your mama's coming.

829
01:40:36,615 --> 01:40:40,278
Once again we are called upon
to restore innocence.

830
01:40:40,485 --> 01:40:44,353
We burn this witch.
We vanquish evil.

831
01:40:45,290 --> 01:40:47,451
No. You can't. You can't.

832
01:40:47,659 --> 01:40:50,287
- Don't let her say this! No!
- We burn the child!

833
01:40:50,495 --> 01:40:52,690
We fight the demon!

834
01:40:55,701 --> 01:40:56,963
She's just a child!

835
01:40:57,169 --> 01:41:00,104
What the fuck is wrong
with you people?

836
01:41:00,572 --> 01:41:02,506
Let her go!

837
01:41:02,974 --> 01:41:05,169
Leave her alone!

838
01:41:05,377 --> 01:41:07,004
Leave her alone!

839
01:41:07,713 --> 01:41:09,578
Those who aid the demon...

840
01:41:09,781 --> 01:41:13,581
...they must be cleansed
by the fire from whence they came.

841
01:41:13,785 --> 01:41:16,345
That's crazy. You're crazy.

842
01:41:17,122 --> 01:41:19,283
No!

843
01:41:19,491 --> 01:41:21,118
Why are you listening to this?

844
01:41:21,326 --> 01:41:23,624
Why?

845
01:41:25,464 --> 01:41:28,399
<i>Burn the witch! Burn her!</i>

846
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:33,697
<i>Burn the witch! Burn her!
Burn the witch!</i>

847
01:41:40,746 --> 01:41:42,543
Sharon.

848
01:41:49,788 --> 01:41:51,813
Evil witch!

849
01:41:52,758 --> 01:41:54,749
Suffer.

850
01:41:59,197 --> 01:42:01,825
<i>Burn the witch! Burn her!</i>

851
01:42:02,033 --> 01:42:05,799
<i>Burn the witch! Burn her!</i>

852
01:42:11,209 --> 01:42:13,575
Oh, my God.

853
01:42:20,852 --> 01:42:25,949
<i>Burn the witch! Burn her!
Burn the witch! Burn her!</i>

854
01:42:26,158 --> 01:42:31,255
<i>Burn the witch! Burn her!
Burn the witch! Burn her!</i>

855
01:42:31,463 --> 01:42:33,021
Burn her!

856
01:42:35,433 --> 01:42:37,765
You're in your own hell.

857
01:42:45,944 --> 01:42:49,675
Mama, be with me.

858
01:43:13,071 --> 01:43:14,936
Here is where the apocalypse began.

859
01:43:15,140 --> 01:43:17,973
This is where we stopped
the annihilation of the world.

860
01:43:18,176 --> 01:43:20,667
We drew a line in the sand
and said:

861
01:43:20,879 --> 01:43:23,313
''Demon, you will not cross!''

862
01:43:23,515 --> 01:43:27,178
But the demon is wicked,
full of treachery.

863
01:43:27,385 --> 01:43:31,549
Yet again he comes to tempt us
in the guise of an innocent.

864
01:43:31,756 --> 01:43:33,747
To rid the world of this demon...

865
01:43:33,959 --> 01:43:36,587
...we must burn this child!

866
01:43:38,430 --> 01:43:40,421
That's not gonna happen!

867
01:43:43,468 --> 01:43:44,435
Mommy!

868
01:43:45,537 --> 01:43:48,938
It's okay, baby.
Everything's gonna be okay.

869
01:43:49,140 --> 01:43:50,869
Oh, my God.

870
01:43:51,076 --> 01:43:53,135
Oh, my God.

871
01:43:53,345 --> 01:43:55,472
What have you people done?

872
01:43:55,680 --> 01:43:58,945
- You have returned.
- Yes, I have.

873
01:43:59,584 --> 01:44:01,575
The witch has returned.

874
01:44:04,556 --> 01:44:08,185
Do not believe her lies.

875
01:44:08,627 --> 01:44:10,595
I come from a world
outside this place.

876
01:44:11,062 --> 01:44:12,825
I come from a world full of life!

877
01:44:16,334 --> 01:44:17,824
Why don't you tell them the truth.

878
01:44:18,036 --> 01:44:21,472
Tell them the truth that you deny,
even to yourself.

879
01:44:21,673 --> 01:44:23,834
There was no apocalypse!

880
01:44:24,042 --> 01:44:26,067
You burned in the fire
that you started...

881
01:44:26,278 --> 01:44:29,577
...and nothing can save you
because you're already damned!

882
01:44:31,449 --> 01:44:32,746
- Mommy!
- Take her.

883
01:44:33,151 --> 01:44:35,517
Burn her. Burn her as a witch.

884
01:44:36,154 --> 01:44:38,748
Burn her! Burn her!

885
01:44:39,157 --> 01:44:40,454
Demon witch!

886
01:44:40,659 --> 01:44:42,217
- Burn me?
- Demon witch.

887
01:44:42,427 --> 01:44:44,361
That's your answer.

888
01:44:44,930 --> 01:44:46,898
Burn anything you're afraid of.

889
01:44:47,098 --> 01:44:49,623
Burn anything you can't control.

890
01:44:51,536 --> 01:44:54,972
This woman uses your fear
to control you.

891
01:44:55,173 --> 01:44:57,698
She led you to burn
Alessa Gillespie.

892
01:44:57,909 --> 01:45:00,742
She led you to burn
an innocent child.

893
01:45:00,946 --> 01:45:04,143
But you will not deny your guilt...

894
01:45:04,349 --> 01:45:06,874
...and you cannot deny her pain!

895
01:45:07,085 --> 01:45:10,248
That child was sin incarnate.

896
01:45:10,755 --> 01:45:14,282
No, it's you who have sinned.

897
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:18,586
You darkened the heart
of an innocent...

898
01:45:18,797 --> 01:45:22,665
...and now you cower in the face
of Alessa's revenge.

899
01:45:22,867 --> 01:45:24,835
- Sinner.
- Heresy.

900
01:45:25,036 --> 01:45:27,061
Burn her. Burn her!

901
01:45:28,406 --> 01:45:32,433
Your faith brings death!

902
01:45:33,812 --> 01:45:35,746
You are alone in this limbo...

903
01:45:35,947 --> 01:45:38,711
...and God is not here.

904
01:45:40,118 --> 01:45:41,176
Mommy!

905
01:45:54,566 --> 01:45:58,593
She was a blasphemer.

906
01:45:59,437 --> 01:46:01,871
Blasphemer!

907
01:46:04,843 --> 01:46:06,674
Blasphemer!

908
01:47:22,253 --> 01:47:24,016
What have you done?

909
01:47:24,923 --> 01:47:26,857
You've brought the darkness in
with you.

910
01:47:27,926 --> 01:47:29,985
Do you know what you've done?

911
01:47:39,137 --> 01:47:41,037
For Sharon.

912
01:47:45,743 --> 01:47:47,438
Mommy.

913
01:47:47,645 --> 01:47:50,512
Mommy. Mommy.

914
01:49:04,022 --> 01:49:05,614
Mommy!

915
01:49:34,552 --> 01:49:38,488
Oh, Lord, give me the strength
to stay pure.

916
01:50:12,757 --> 01:50:15,282
No! No!

917
01:50:47,292 --> 01:50:51,422
Alessa, what have you become?

918
01:51:05,510 --> 01:51:07,410
Mommy!

919
01:51:08,646 --> 01:51:12,082
Sharon! Sharon, honey, it's me.
It's Mommy.

920
01:51:33,338 --> 01:51:34,669
Down! We're getting down.

921
01:51:34,872 --> 01:51:37,306
Shut your eyes.
Shut your eyes, baby.

922
01:51:38,376 --> 01:51:40,071
Shut your eyes. Shut your eyes.

923
01:51:48,886 --> 01:51:51,081
Shut your eyes. Shut your eyes.

924
01:51:51,289 --> 01:51:54,781
It's just a bad dream.
It's just a bad dream.

925
01:52:43,474 --> 01:52:46,932
Why did she not take me
with the others?

926
01:52:48,813 --> 01:52:50,940
Because you're her mother.

927
01:52:55,853 --> 01:52:58,845
Mother is God in the eyes of a child.

928
01:53:26,951 --> 01:53:28,782
I love you.

929
01:54:37,922 --> 01:54:40,186
<i>- Hi, this is Chris.

Christopher, it's me.

01:54:49,934 --> 01:54:51,196
I'm with Sharon.

Yeah. We're coming home.
