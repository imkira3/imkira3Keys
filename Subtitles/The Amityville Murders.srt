00:01:28,449 --> 00:01:30,715
<i>Testing.</i>

4
00:01:30,717 --> 00:01:33,318
<i>Okay, so here we are.</i>

5
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,054
<i>My name's Dawn, Dawn DeFeo,</i>

6
00:01:36,056 --> 00:01:38,456
<i>and this is where I live.</i>

7
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:41,759
<i>It's finally here,
my big day.</i>

8
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:45,196
<i>Eighteen and ready
to conquer the world.</i>

9
00:01:45,198 --> 00:01:47,464
<i>Back here, my family's
throwing a party.</i>

10
00:01:47,466 --> 00:01:50,634
<i>As if Italians need another
excuse to celebrate.</i>

11
00:01:50,636 --> 00:01:53,071
<i>Say hello to my new camera,
Allison.</i>

12
00:01:53,073 --> 00:01:55,306
<i>Hello to my new camera,
Allison.</i>

13
00:01:55,308 --> 00:01:57,144
<i>Smartass.</i>

14
00:01:59,179 --> 00:02:00,743
<i>Just my luck, right?</i>

15
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:02,712
<i>Born on the same day
as my big, dumb brother.</i>

16
00:02:04,316 --> 00:02:08,584
<i>Bring it back!
Shaggy took my Weeble.</i>

17
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,720
Fanabla, <i>Jody!
You ruined my shot!</i>

18
00:02:10,722 --> 00:02:12,692
<i>I'm telling!</i>

19
00:02:14,258 --> 00:02:15,826
<i>Hey, cut it out, you pigs!</i>

20
00:02:15,828 --> 00:02:19,128
<i>Marc, don't make me break
your other arm.</i>

21
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:22,231
<i>You rotten little shits!
Stop it! Mom!</i>

22
00:02:22,233 --> 00:02:25,233
<i>And this is my mommy,
who makes the best cakes</i>

23
00:02:25,235 --> 00:02:27,636
<i>and the best cannoli
in the whole entire world.</i>

24
00:02:27,638 --> 00:02:31,474
<i>I spent all day long making
this cake. What're doing?</i>

25
00:02:31,476 --> 00:02:34,342
<i>Ronnie!
What are you doing?</i>

26
00:02:34,344 --> 00:02:38,112
<i>You're turning my $1.19 a pound
ground round into charred ash!</i>

27
00:02:38,114 --> 00:02:41,381
<i>Where's Butch? Better not be
smoking that shit again.</i>

28
00:02:41,383 --> 00:02:44,218
- <i>Get out here!</i>
- <i>All right, I'm here.</i>

29
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,724
<i>Quit busting my chops.
Get out of my face.</i>

30
00:02:52,461 --> 00:02:54,728
Now look what
I've gone and done.

31
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,396
Ma, I'm not six years old
anymore, all right. Cut it out.

32
00:02:57,398 --> 00:03:01,335
Hey, watch your mouth. Don't
get smark with your mother.

33
00:03:01,337 --> 00:03:02,735
Been looking for you
for 20 minutes. Where you been?

34
00:03:02,737 --> 00:03:04,603
I was with Donna Benedettio,

35
00:03:04,605 --> 00:03:06,605
helping her fix the antennae
on her television.

36
00:03:06,607 --> 00:03:09,709
I bet that wasn't all you were
doing. Donna Benedettio.

37
00:03:09,711 --> 00:03:11,210
I don't want you hanging out
with that <i>puttana.</i>

38
00:03:11,212 --> 00:03:12,611
She's from the gutter.

39
00:03:12,613 --> 00:03:14,379
What plays in the gutter
stays in the gutter.

40
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:16,482
Don't forget that.
Right, we're from Brooklyn.

41
00:03:16,484 --> 00:03:17,716
Makes us practically royalty.

42
00:03:17,718 --> 00:03:19,519
I'm sorry, what'd you say?

43
00:03:19,521 --> 00:03:22,387
Ronnie, please,
stop it, it's his day.

44
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:24,555
His day, every day's his day.

45
00:03:24,557 --> 00:03:26,892
Hanging around my house
like a bum.

46
00:03:26,894 --> 00:03:29,360
Huh, smoking pot
with his hippy friends,

47
00:03:29,362 --> 00:03:31,429
not out in the real world
making something of himself,

48
00:03:31,431 --> 00:03:33,565
fighting for his country
like a real man, huh?

49
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:36,803
Send him to that hell so he
can come back in a bodybag?

50
00:03:38,537 --> 00:03:42,506
Besides, he's applied
to Syracuse for next semester,

51
00:03:42,508 --> 00:03:43,840
didn't you, Butch?

52
00:03:43,842 --> 00:03:45,409
He's gonna get in,
I know he will.

53
00:03:45,411 --> 00:03:46,876
Come on, who you kidding?

54
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:48,447
He ain't got the brains
for college.

55
00:03:49,281 --> 00:03:50,648
Whoo!

56
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,782
Now everyone be nice. Okay.

57
00:03:52,784 --> 00:03:54,951
- Hello sweetheart.
- Hi Papa.

58
00:03:54,953 --> 00:03:58,654
- Hi honey.
- Thank you for coming.

59
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:02,357
Oh, we wouldn't miss this
blessed occasion, Louise.

60
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:05,528
They grow up and they don't want
to visit Grandpa...

61
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,664
- Silenzio, Michael.
- ...in the city.

62
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,199
- Good to see you.
- You too.

63
00:04:10,201 --> 00:04:12,634
- Sweetheart.
- Hey, Pappa.

64
00:04:12,636 --> 00:04:17,439
Look. You're going off
to college, I understand.

65
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:18,773
Yeah.

66
00:04:18,775 --> 00:04:20,576
How you gonna get there?

67
00:04:20,578 --> 00:04:23,579
You're not gonna walk.
There, buddy.

68
00:04:23,581 --> 00:04:24,979
Don't be jealous.

69
00:04:24,981 --> 00:04:27,414
- Doll, here.
- No way.

70
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,517
Pappa, no, it's all too much.

71
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,618
Family is everything,
you know that.

72
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,787
I own the dealership,
don't worry about it.

73
00:04:33,789 --> 00:04:35,522
Thank you, Nona. Guys, look!

74
00:04:35,524 --> 00:04:38,226
You're kidding me.

75
00:04:38,228 --> 00:04:40,293
Oh my gosh.

76
00:04:40,295 --> 00:04:42,629
These are some foxy wheels.

77
00:04:42,631 --> 00:04:44,331
This is groovy.

78
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,932
Oh my god.

79
00:04:45,934 --> 00:04:47,901
- How do I look.
- You look so good.

80
00:04:47,903 --> 00:04:51,437
Give me those keys. If he wants
a car, he should earn it.

81
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:52,872
Like I did.

82
00:04:52,874 --> 00:04:55,541
The last time I checked,
you were on my payroll.

83
00:04:55,543 --> 00:04:58,376
Give those back to the kid.
He's my grandson.

84
00:04:58,378 --> 00:05:00,379
I want him
to have those keys.

85
00:05:00,381 --> 00:05:03,782
Now stop this shit. Go inside
that fancy house of yours.

86
00:05:03,784 --> 00:05:06,888
Go get me a glass
of vino, please.

87
00:05:15,961 --> 00:05:19,563
<i>Maddon'.</i>
You call this marinara?

88
00:05:19,565 --> 00:05:21,699
That's how Ronnie likes it.

89
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:25,806
Well, it tastes like your
father's old socks.

90
00:05:26,805 --> 00:05:28,605
- Ma, don't!
- What?

91
00:05:28,607 --> 00:05:31,742
Ronnie don't like
his gravy so strong.

92
00:05:31,744 --> 00:05:33,710
Is that man putting his hands
to you again?

93
00:05:33,712 --> 00:05:36,646
No, Ma, everything's good.

94
00:05:36,648 --> 00:05:39,882
In fact, we've been talking
about the future.

95
00:05:39,884 --> 00:05:42,254
The future?

96
00:05:43,455 --> 00:05:45,688
Yeah.

97
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:48,424
I didn't want to say anything
until we made our decision,

98
00:05:48,426 --> 00:05:50,693
but...

99
00:05:50,695 --> 00:05:54,597
Ronnie got a job offer
in California.

100
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:58,667
It's good money, and chance
for him to forge his own path.

101
00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:00,334
You know, and with Butch

102
00:06:00,336 --> 00:06:03,404
and then Dawn going
to college next year,

103
00:06:03,406 --> 00:06:05,342
we really don't need
all this room.

104
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,711
Are you selling my house?

105
00:06:09,713 --> 00:06:11,478
I don't know, Ma, we...

106
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,651
Like I said,
we haven't made any decisions.

107
00:06:16,051 --> 00:06:17,518
Hey Nona.

108
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,986
Hi sweetheart.

109
00:06:18,988 --> 00:06:20,857
Mmm.

110
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,657
Love you, Mom.

111
00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:26,962
I don't want you kids down the
cellar all day. We got company.

112
00:06:33,802 --> 00:06:36,601
You know, they say if you play
this song backwards

113
00:06:36,603 --> 00:06:38,603
you can hear the voice
of Satan.

114
00:06:38,605 --> 00:06:41,841
It's the sound your mother made
when she gave birth to you.

115
00:06:41,843 --> 00:06:43,608
Ha ha ha, real funny.

116
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:46,012
All right,
name your first crush.

117
00:06:46,014 --> 00:06:48,612
Loretta Lynn.

118
00:06:48,614 --> 00:06:49,948
Shut the fuck up, Beak.
I've got it.

119
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:53,352
Angie fucking Dickinson,
<i>Police Woman.</i>

120
00:06:53,354 --> 00:06:56,021
What I wouldn't do with those
two magnificent melons.

121
00:06:56,023 --> 00:06:58,025
You're so gross.

122
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,596
Butch DeFeo.

123
00:07:03,628 --> 00:07:05,331
Okay.

124
00:07:07,933 --> 00:07:09,599
Next one. A verb.

125
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:11,501
Great, now I'm busy
smoking it.

126
00:07:11,503 --> 00:07:13,906
She said verb,
not herb, you putz.

127
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,707
One more time, Pelskie,
and I'll...

128
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:18,008
And you'll what, huh, Beak?

129
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:20,709
Hey, guys, mellow the fuck out,
okay?

130
00:07:20,711 --> 00:07:22,682
I'll choose.

131
00:07:24,682 --> 00:07:26,382
Murder.

132
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:30,687
Okay.

133
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:32,891
Next one...

134
00:07:34,126 --> 00:07:35,492
Current state of mind.

135
00:07:35,494 --> 00:07:37,426
Insane.

136
00:07:38,762 --> 00:07:40,532
Okay.

137
00:07:41,431 --> 00:07:44,400
And last one...

138
00:07:44,402 --> 00:07:45,801
favorite room in the house.

139
00:07:45,803 --> 00:07:47,503
Any room
where I can do this.

140
00:07:48,873 --> 00:07:51,140
You are disgusting,
you know that?

141
00:07:51,142 --> 00:07:53,574
You're a pig, Pelskie.
Oh, get off me.

142
00:07:53,576 --> 00:07:55,909
- Get her.
- Mess up my hair.

143
00:07:55,911 --> 00:07:58,882
Well, mine would be
the red room.

144
00:08:01,184 --> 00:08:02,916
What the hell is a red room?

145
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:05,685
Well, read it,
and I'll show you.

146
00:08:05,687 --> 00:08:07,556
Okay.

147
00:08:09,624 --> 00:08:13,727
Butch DeFeo is going
to murder you

148
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:17,099
after going insane
in the red room.

149
00:08:31,012 --> 00:08:34,013
This used to be
our secret hiding place.

150
00:08:34,015 --> 00:08:35,951
Come on, follow me.

151
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:45,925
Whoa.

152
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:49,429
Get off me.

153
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:52,029
Hey, did you see that?

154
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,998
Watch your fuckin' hands,
you jerk!

155
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,101
That wasn't me.
That was a ghost.

156
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,176
Come on in, gather around.

157
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:07,679
Nope.

158
00:09:08,713 --> 00:09:10,080
Butch, aren't you coming?

159
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:13,652
All right.

160
00:09:16,855 --> 00:09:18,423
Right here.

161
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:22,927
Now that everyone's here,
we can begin.

162
00:09:26,563 --> 00:09:28,230
Okay.

163
00:09:28,232 --> 00:09:31,500
Now, growing up on Long Island,
we've all heard the stories

164
00:09:31,502 --> 00:09:34,803
about how this area was believed
to be a portal

165
00:09:34,805 --> 00:09:36,837
of spirit energy,

166
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:39,777
a place where the living
could commune with the dead.

167
00:09:41,811 --> 00:09:44,547
This book belonged
to our grandmother.

168
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,716
In order for a summoning
to take place,

169
00:09:49,718 --> 00:09:51,921
there must always
be an offering.

170
00:09:58,994 --> 00:10:02,228
She taught us that if we focused
our thoughts hard enough

171
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:05,532
we could harness that energy
and invite it in.

172
00:10:05,534 --> 00:10:07,569
Hmm.

173
00:10:20,914 --> 00:10:22,580
Your mother sucks cocks
in hell.

174
00:10:22,582 --> 00:10:23,952
Shhh.

175
00:10:37,563 --> 00:10:42,702
Now that is seriously
some heavy shit.

176
00:11:13,698 --> 00:11:15,731
What in God's name
is going on down here?

177
00:11:15,733 --> 00:11:18,299
Daddy, we were just
playing around, okay?

178
00:11:18,301 --> 00:11:21,702
Get your ass upstairs if you
know what's good for you.

179
00:11:21,704 --> 00:11:23,837
Hmm? Goes for the rest
of you.

180
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,606
Get the hell out of my house,
you goddamn losers.

181
00:11:25,608 --> 00:11:28,843
All of you, get out!
Get out! Get out!

182
00:11:28,845 --> 00:11:30,278
Daddy, listen to me.

183
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,346
Okay, it wasn't his fault.

184
00:11:32,348 --> 00:11:34,681
I'm the one that told them
they could go in there.

185
00:11:34,683 --> 00:11:36,749
Haven't I told you I don't allow
dopers and whores

186
00:11:36,751 --> 00:11:40,020
or <i>mulignans</i> in my house,
didn't I tell you that?

187
00:11:40,022 --> 00:11:41,821
- Huh?
- That's funny.

188
00:11:41,823 --> 00:11:44,291
'Cause all I see is a sad,
pathetic old pig.

189
00:11:44,293 --> 00:11:47,960
No! Butch! Are you okay?

190
00:11:47,962 --> 00:11:50,196
- What'd you call me?
- Daddy, no!

191
00:11:50,198 --> 00:11:52,263
No, not that, please!

192
00:11:52,265 --> 00:11:55,200
No! No,
you're not doing that, Daddy!

193
00:11:55,202 --> 00:11:58,103
Huh? Huh?

194
00:11:58,105 --> 00:12:00,271
Who do you think you are?

195
00:12:00,273 --> 00:12:01,777
Don't you ever...

196
00:12:02,677 --> 00:12:04,075
ever...

197
00:12:04,077 --> 00:12:06,646
ever talk to me
that way again.

198
00:12:06,648 --> 00:12:08,148
That's enough!

199
00:12:09,081 --> 00:12:10,914
Daddy, please.

200
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:13,717
Get upstairs, you little pansy.
Change your clothes.

201
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:15,889
Your mother wants to cut
the goddamn cake.

202
00:12:18,825 --> 00:12:22,159
Butch, let me see.
Are you okay?

203
00:12:22,161 --> 00:12:24,030
Oh my god.

204
00:12:25,296 --> 00:12:27,199
It's okay.

205
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,336
It's looking better.

206
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,973
Gotta get out
of this house, Butch.

207
00:12:35,373 --> 00:12:37,307
Just gotta drive somewhere,

208
00:12:37,309 --> 00:12:39,208
far away,
as far as we can go.

209
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,444
I've tried.

210
00:12:41,446 --> 00:12:44,814
- Right? He always finds me.
- Please.

211
00:12:44,816 --> 00:12:48,988
It's never gonna end, until that
son of a bitch is gone for good.

212
00:12:51,088 --> 00:12:53,992
It's either gonna be us or him,
you know that.

Why not? Are you afraid big bad
Ronnie'll catch you in the act?

235

Hey, shut your trap!

237
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,593
Hey, did you bring
that acid tab for me?

238
00:17:44,595 --> 00:17:47,331

Yes, Bella, witches,
real witches.

283
00:26:59,216 --> 00:27:02,616
See, in ancient times,
it was the night

284
00:27:02,618 --> 00:27:05,620
the dead
returned to their homes,

285
00:27:05,622 --> 00:27:09,591
when dark spirits ran amok
across the countryside,

286
00:27:09,593 --> 00:27:11,625
and when offerings were made

287

for the coming
of the winter solstice.

288

No, not your voices.

318
00:28:34,205 --> 00:28:36,873
All right. Will you drop me off

319
00:28:36,875 --> 00:28:39,007
- Bring me my pocketbook.
- Oh, my gloves.

00:28:43,613 --> 00:28:46,615
Now Butch, I want you
to go upstairs

322
00:28:46,617 --> 00:28:48,584
and get in bed, <i>subito.</i>

323
00:28:48,586 --> 00:28:52,123
And if you get hungry, there's
minestrone in the ice box.

324
00:29:16,845 --> 00:29:18,612
Ronnie!

325
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,185
If I see you, you're dead.

326
00:29:35,096 --> 00:29:37,863
Come on, where are ya?

327
00:29:37,865 --> 00:29:40,101
Show your face, I kill ya.

328
00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:43,401
It'll be okay, Jody.

329
00:29:47,106 --> 00:29:49,108
It's gonna be okay.

330
00:29:55,214 --> 00:29:58,018
Broke into
the wrong house, guys.

331
00:30:01,687 --> 00:30:04,121
Why would they do this?
They didn't even steal anything.

332
00:30:04,123 --> 00:30:06,659
I don't know.
It'll be okay.

333
00:30:10,261 --> 00:30:13,964
Where are ya?!
You're a dead man!

334
00:30:13,966 --> 00:30:15,296
Stay.

335
00:30:15,298 --> 00:30:17,201
Ronnie!

336
00:30:34,183 --> 00:30:36,319
Son of a bitch!

337
00:30:37,987 --> 00:30:39,923
Goddamn it.

338
00:30:43,025 --> 00:30:44,359
Where is he?

339
00:30:44,361 --> 00:30:48,195
No! No! No, Ronnie! Please!

340
00:30:48,197 --> 00:30:51,368
Get off me.
Where the fuck is he?

341
00:30:58,807 --> 00:31:01,041
Fucker. Where is it?
Where is it?

342
00:31:01,043 --> 00:31:03,475
I'm asking where it is!
Tell me, you son of a bitch.

343
00:31:03,477 --> 00:31:06,979
- Don't! Stop it!
- Where is it?

344
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:12,484
Did you steal from me?!
Did you fucking steal from me?!

345
00:31:12,486 --> 00:31:16,856
Did you fucking steal from me?!
Did you fucking steal from me?!

346
00:31:16,858 --> 00:31:18,423
Stop, Daddy!

347
00:31:18,425 --> 00:31:20,759
If you fucking did
I'll kill you.

348
00:31:20,761 --> 00:31:22,394
You son a bitch!

349
00:31:22,396 --> 00:31:25,030
Let go of him!
Let go of him! Let go...

350
00:31:27,201 --> 00:31:31,406
That would be the cops.
I called them.

351
00:31:36,175 --> 00:31:37,942
Don't do it.

352
00:31:37,944 --> 00:31:41,010
Don't do it, Daddy.

353
00:31:41,012 --> 00:31:45,782
No broken windows,
no signs of forced entry,

354
00:31:45,784 --> 00:31:48,486
and you're not away
of anything that was stolen?

355
00:31:48,488 --> 00:31:50,519
Well, my husband's
personal safe...

356
00:31:50,521 --> 00:31:52,087
Nothing was taken, officer.

357
00:31:52,089 --> 00:31:54,324
- I put the kids down.
- Where's Butch?

358
00:31:54,326 --> 00:31:56,226
Who's Butch, ma'am?

359
00:31:56,228 --> 00:31:57,826
Oh, he's my eldest son.

360
00:31:57,828 --> 00:31:59,362
He's the only one
who's been home tonight.

361
00:31:59,364 --> 00:32:01,131
And is Butch
in the house now?

362
00:32:01,133 --> 00:32:03,833
Well yes,
but he's been quite ill.

363
00:32:03,835 --> 00:32:06,300
Doctors say he's got the bug
that's been going around.

364
00:32:06,302 --> 00:32:09,470
I'd still like to speak with
him, if it's all the same.

365
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:11,239
You know, it's Halloween.

366
00:32:11,241 --> 00:32:13,208
It's probably some neighborhood
bums playing pranks.

367
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:16,245
But they didn't take nothing
so let's just call it a night.

368
00:32:16,247 --> 00:32:18,846
- What do you say?
- Your son, Mr. DeFeo?

369
00:32:18,848 --> 00:32:20,114
Yeah.

370
00:32:20,116 --> 00:32:22,083
- Are you Butch DeFeo?
- Yes sir.

371
00:32:22,085 --> 00:32:24,951
Mind telling us what happened
while your family was out?

372
00:32:24,953 --> 00:32:29,422
I don't know. I was asleep
upstairs, like my mother said.

373
00:32:29,424 --> 00:32:31,292
I didn't hear nothing.

374
00:32:31,294 --> 00:32:34,027
Butch, sweetheart, you don't
look so good. Go upstairs.

375
00:32:34,029 --> 00:32:35,962
Hold on, hold on.

376
00:32:35,964 --> 00:32:39,099
You expect us to believe that
someone ransacked this house,

377
00:32:39,101 --> 00:32:41,368
except for the one you were in,
and you didn't hear a thing?

378
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:44,004
If my boy says he didn't see
nothing or hear nothing,

379
00:32:44,006 --> 00:32:47,274
he didn't hear nothing,
that's all.

380
00:32:47,276 --> 00:32:49,876
All right, Mr. DeFeo,
thank you for your time.

381
00:32:49,878 --> 00:32:51,578
If you or your wife think
of anything else,

382
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,947
or you find out
that something was stolen,

383
00:32:53,949 --> 00:32:55,947
please, give us a call.

384
00:32:55,949 --> 00:32:59,552
Oh, thank you very much,
appreciate it, guys.

385
00:32:59,554 --> 00:33:03,488
Incidently, sir, shouldn't have
your firearm out like that.

386
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:06,257
Yeah, you're right.
Have a good night, guys.

387
00:33:06,259 --> 00:33:08,362
Keep your family safe.

388
00:33:10,095 --> 00:33:11,765
Let's get out of here.

389
00:33:18,604 --> 00:33:20,405
Did you do it, Butch?

390
00:33:20,407 --> 00:33:22,439
Did you take the money
from the safe?

391
00:33:22,441 --> 00:33:24,908
You'd be the first
to know if I did.

392
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:29,111
You've been acting weird
ever since...

393
00:33:29,113 --> 00:33:31,281
Since the moment you decided we
should play the game

394
00:33:31,283 --> 00:33:33,019
with them again.

395
00:33:37,289 --> 00:33:41,390
Remember when we used
to talk to them?

396
00:33:41,392 --> 00:33:43,559
And they would
keep us safe

397
00:33:43,561 --> 00:33:49,298
whenever Daddy was drinking
or in one of his moods?

398
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:53,235
Well, something different
happened there the other day.

399
00:33:53,237 --> 00:33:58,639
Okay, I don't know what it was
or how to explain it, but...

400
00:33:58,641 --> 00:34:02,946
it was almost
like we made them angry.

401
00:34:03,614 --> 00:34:05,249
How?

402
00:34:09,319 --> 00:34:12,253
What did they used
to tell us?

403
00:34:12,255 --> 00:34:14,191
How we would always live here.

404
00:34:16,292 --> 00:34:18,625
We've been talking
about moving out.

405
00:34:18,627 --> 00:34:20,995
Mom and Dad have been talking
about moving out.

406
00:34:20,997 --> 00:34:22,997
Come on, Butch.

407
00:34:22,999 --> 00:34:25,131
We were kids, playing a game.

408
00:34:25,133 --> 00:34:27,369
It was all
in our imagination.

409
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:33,907
Well...

410
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:35,945
if we did wake them up...

411
00:34:37,378 --> 00:34:40,215
then maybe there's a way
we can put them back to sleep.

412
00:36:07,997 --> 00:36:11,634
- Talk to me.
- Where is it?!

413
00:36:12,533 --> 00:36:15,102
What?

414
00:36:15,104 --> 00:36:17,069
- Where is it?!
- I don't understand!

415
00:36:17,071 --> 00:36:19,238
Where is it? Where is it?

416
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,173
What's happening?

417
00:36:21,175 --> 00:36:23,608
- Where is it? Fucking money!
- What?! What?!

418
00:36:33,253 --> 00:36:36,154
I'm gonna die, Louise.

419
00:36:36,156 --> 00:36:38,992
- Ronnie!
- I'm gonna die!

420
00:37:25,203 --> 00:37:28,836
<i>And here's the star
of</i> Name That Song,

421
00:37:28,838 --> 00:37:31,476
<i>Jack Atwater.</i>

422
00:39:18,407 --> 00:39:20,407
Quick, shut the door

423
00:39:20,409 --> 00:39:22,245
What's going on?

424
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,181
There's someone parked
across the street.

425
00:39:26,183 --> 00:39:28,583
Butch, they've been watching
the house.

426
00:39:28,585 --> 00:39:30,885
Yeah, they're still there.

427
00:39:30,887 --> 00:39:32,523
Butch, go look.

428
00:39:33,489 --> 00:39:35,522
They're right there.

429
00:39:35,524 --> 00:39:37,827
Butch, don't let 'em
see you.

430
00:39:39,861 --> 00:39:43,296
I wonder if it's the people
who broke into the house.

431
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:44,964
Do you think they're casing
the neighborhood?

432
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:46,399
Should I call the cops again?

433
00:39:46,401 --> 00:39:48,570
Looks like they're gone now.

434
00:39:53,574 --> 00:39:55,441
Butch, I don't know.

435
00:39:55,443 --> 00:39:58,244
I have a strange feeling
that something really bad's

436
00:39:58,246 --> 00:40:00,182
about to happen.

437
00:40:01,548 --> 00:40:03,349
Butch, why ain't you
talking to me?

438
00:40:05,353 --> 00:40:07,288
You okay?

439
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:18,332
Stop playing around, okay?
You're really scaring me.

440
00:40:23,903 --> 00:40:25,735
Butch, stop,
what are you doing?

441
00:40:25,737 --> 00:40:27,740
Yes.

442
00:40:28,874 --> 00:40:30,544
Yes.

443
00:40:32,244 --> 00:40:35,248
Don't blame her.
It's not her fault.

444
00:40:36,816 --> 00:40:39,014
Yes.

445
00:40:39,016 --> 00:40:41,219
Let go.

446
00:40:42,419 --> 00:40:43,688
Yes.

447
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:48,660
I can't do that.

448
00:40:54,264 --> 00:40:55,699
Not now.

449
00:40:59,336 --> 00:41:00,872
I promise.

450
00:42:25,351 --> 00:42:27,353
What are you doing
in here?

451
00:42:28,353 --> 00:42:31,756
Butch?

452
00:42:57,114 --> 00:42:58,613
Daddy, what is going on?

453
00:42:58,615 --> 00:43:00,581
- Stay right here, don't move.
- No.

454
00:43:03,852 --> 00:43:06,522
Knock it off, Shaggy!

455
00:43:11,026 --> 00:43:12,859
It's just me.

456
00:43:12,861 --> 00:43:14,763
Shh.

457
00:43:31,044 --> 00:43:34,478
Good boy.

458
00:43:42,156 --> 00:43:44,422
Daddy!

459
00:43:44,424 --> 00:43:46,393
Son of a bitch.

460
00:43:48,661 --> 00:43:52,566
Come to my house
in the middle of the night!

461
00:43:57,769 --> 00:44:00,039
Show your face, you coward!

462
00:44:05,211 --> 00:44:07,509
Come on, I'm waiting!

463
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:08,980
Come on!

464
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:13,085
It's okay.

465
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,225
Yes.

466
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:25,493
<i>For the last time,
I wanna know what's going on.</i>

467
00:44:25,495 --> 00:44:27,129
I know.

468
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:29,701
<i>There's nothing
going on. go back to bed.</i>

469
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,468
But I can't.

470
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:35,636
<i>I'm scared. I saw a man
in a car outside my window.</i>

471
00:44:35,638 --> 00:44:37,641
I don't want to.

472
00:44:39,242 --> 00:44:40,907
<i>Would you
listen to her?</i>

473
00:44:40,909 --> 00:44:42,909
<i>Your family's lives
are in danger.</i>

474
00:44:42,911 --> 00:44:44,878
You can't make me...

475
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,682
<i>You're insane? This
goddamn family's gone insane!</i>

476
00:44:48,684 --> 00:44:50,520
...kill them.

477
00:45:07,602 --> 00:45:11,070
I can't talk about it right now,
Ma, I've got too much going on.

478
00:45:11,072 --> 00:45:13,505
Yes, I'm gonna make the lasagne.
I'm making your favorite recipe.

479
00:45:13,507 --> 00:45:16,075
I'm gonna kill both of you
if you don't knock it off.

480
00:45:16,077 --> 00:45:18,077
I've got finals
to study for.

481
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:19,778
These kids are driving me
up the wall.

482
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:21,713
No, Ma, not this weekend.

483
00:45:21,715 --> 00:45:23,949
I've got too much going on.

484
00:45:23,951 --> 00:45:25,850
Tell Dad thank you
for the card.

485
00:45:25,852 --> 00:45:28,118
Of course we're coming
for Thanksgiving.

486
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:31,623
Oh shoot! I don't remember, is
it two cups of polenta or three?

487
00:45:31,625 --> 00:45:33,991
I've gotta go, Ma. Ronnie's
almost home. Talk to you later.

488
00:45:33,993 --> 00:45:36,227
Love you, bye.

489
00:45:36,229 --> 00:45:38,165
That's not fair.
I want some.

490
00:45:39,866 --> 00:45:43,233
Marc, what did I tell you?
No fluffernutter before supper.

491
00:45:43,235 --> 00:45:46,003
Goddamnit, Ma, these are
the best things going!

492
00:45:46,005 --> 00:45:48,805
You watch that filthy mouth
or I will wash it out with soap!

493
00:45:48,807 --> 00:45:50,740
Oh, Ma.

494
00:45:50,742 --> 00:45:54,278
Allison, do not even think about
drinking out of that bottle.

495
00:45:57,016 --> 00:45:58,947
Oh, damn it, Allison!

496
00:45:58,949 --> 00:46:00,315
Sorry. It was an accident.

497
00:46:00,317 --> 00:46:02,585
- Clean it up.
- I'm cleaning it.

498
00:46:02,587 --> 00:46:05,186
- Hey, Mrs. D.
- Is Butch around?

499
00:46:05,188 --> 00:46:07,056
- Hi boys. He's up in his room.
- Scram.

500
00:46:07,058 --> 00:46:09,625
He's still feeling
under the weather.

501
00:46:09,627 --> 00:46:12,661
What's wrong with him? Haven't
seen his ugly mug for weeks.

502
00:46:12,663 --> 00:46:15,062
- I wish I knew.
- Give me that!

503
00:46:15,064 --> 00:46:18,033
- It's almost time to eat.
- Is there pasta?

504
00:46:18,035 --> 00:46:20,234
- Do you mind?
- I don't mind at all.

505
00:46:20,236 --> 00:46:22,803
- Doesn't your mother feed you?
- Sure.

506
00:46:22,805 --> 00:46:26,841
There's no comparison between
her rump roast and yours.

507
00:46:26,843 --> 00:46:30,009
Stop. Cut it out. Stop.

508
00:46:30,011 --> 00:46:32,913
Come on, guys. Last one upstairs
is a rotten egg.

509
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:34,985
Stop. It's my dad.

510
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:39,018
Well, I guess I'm late
to the party, huh?

511
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:41,956
Ronnie, they were
just horsing around.

512
00:46:41,958 --> 00:46:43,726
Yeah, I can see that.

513
00:46:44,726 --> 00:46:46,593
Having a big party?

514
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:50,129
Butch should be down soon,
if you wanna stay for supper.

515
00:46:50,131 --> 00:46:52,999
Yeah, sure. Why not?

516
00:46:53,001 --> 00:46:55,068
Therefore...

517
00:46:55,070 --> 00:46:58,638
<i>I shall resign the presidency
effective at noon tomorrow.</i>

518
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,339
It's been three months,

519
00:47:00,341 --> 00:47:02,373
they're still playing
this bullshit.

520
00:47:02,375 --> 00:47:04,809
Leave it to the bleeding heart
liberal media to stick it

521
00:47:04,811 --> 00:47:06,280
to the last great leader.

522
00:47:08,148 --> 00:47:10,285
What do you say, fellas?
Can I offer you a cold one?

523
00:47:11,317 --> 00:47:14,052
Uh... Sure, Mr. DeFeo.

524
00:47:14,054 --> 00:47:16,355
There you go.

525
00:47:16,357 --> 00:47:18,158
Yeah.

526
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:23,730
Daddy, I'm just trying
to study here.

527
00:47:30,069 --> 00:47:32,268
Ahh.

528
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:35,771
You know, back in my day, when
we paid our neighbors a visit

529
00:47:35,773 --> 00:47:38,877
we showed our elders
the proper respect.

530
00:47:40,811 --> 00:47:43,213
We didn't put our lazy
unshowered, good-for-nothing

531
00:47:43,215 --> 00:47:45,151
keisters on
their fine furniture.

532
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,951
We didn't sit inappropriately
next to their teenage daughters.

533
00:47:49,953 --> 00:47:51,754
Daddy, please stop.

534
00:47:51,756 --> 00:47:55,424
And we especially
didn't make lewd sexual remarks

535
00:47:55,426 --> 00:47:57,025
in front
of our own mothers.

536
00:47:57,027 --> 00:47:59,094
Hey, Mom, I'll help you.

537
00:47:59,096 --> 00:48:01,897
Back in my day...

538
00:48:01,899 --> 00:48:03,832
- we showed 'em who was boss.
- Daddy...

539
00:48:03,834 --> 00:48:05,999
- In my day, that's what we did!
- Daddy!

540
00:48:06,001 --> 00:48:07,769
We showed 'em who was boss!

541
00:48:07,771 --> 00:48:09,736
We showed 'em who was boss!

542
00:48:09,738 --> 00:48:11,939
- We showed 'em who was boss!
- No!

543
00:48:11,941 --> 00:48:13,807
You see that?!
Is that what you want?!

544
00:48:13,809 --> 00:48:15,108
You fuckin' mutt!

545
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:16,713
Leave her alone!

546
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:20,881
Let's show the boys a little
party. Is that what you want?

547
00:48:20,883 --> 00:48:23,083
You little whore!
Is that what you are?!

548
00:48:23,085 --> 00:48:25,451
You want these fucking mutts
all over you?!

549
00:48:27,422 --> 00:48:30,891
Is that what you like? You want
these animals all over you?!

550
00:48:30,893 --> 00:48:33,793
You want these fucking mutts
all over you?!

551
00:48:33,795 --> 00:48:36,929
You want these fucking animals'
hands all over you?!

552
00:48:36,931 --> 00:48:39,200
I'll fucking kill you!

553
00:48:44,939 --> 00:48:46,738
<i>I hope</i>

554
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:50,175
<i>that I will have hastened
the start</i>

555
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:52,378
<i>of that process of healing</i>

556
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:54,445
<i>which is so
desperately needed.</i>

557
00:48:54,447 --> 00:48:58,049
<i>I regred deeply any injuries
that may have been done</i>

558
00:48:58,051 --> 00:49:01,087
<i>in the course of the events
that led to this decision.</i>

559
00:49:04,056 --> 00:49:08,728
<i>...rediscover
those shared ideas...</i>

560
00:49:20,305 --> 00:49:22,008
Let me see, Mom.

561
00:49:26,177 --> 00:49:28,914
This has been going on
for years.

562
00:49:30,215 --> 00:49:34,386
It has to stop now
before it's too late.

563
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:38,887
Did I ever tell you
I used to have

564
00:49:38,889 --> 00:49:43,193
the most vivid dreams when I was
a girl growing up in this house.

565
00:49:44,894 --> 00:49:48,763
I dreamed of having
my own family,

566
00:49:48,765 --> 00:49:51,301
the children I would bring
into this world.

567
00:49:54,338 --> 00:49:56,874
Your grandmother told me
they were premonitions.

568
00:49:57,974 --> 00:49:59,876
And she was right.

569
00:50:03,246 --> 00:50:05,148
But lately...

570
00:50:06,849 --> 00:50:09,052
my dreams
have been different.

571
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,956
I see the end coming.

572
00:50:16,424 --> 00:50:18,961
A terrible...

573
00:50:19,861 --> 00:50:21,263
beautiful...

574
00:50:22,163 --> 00:50:23,432
end.

575
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,336
I see rain...

576
00:50:28,569 --> 00:50:30,871
and blood.

577
00:50:31,838 --> 00:50:34,108
And when it's all over...

578
00:50:36,376 --> 00:50:38,045
...I feel...

579
00:50:38,845 --> 00:50:40,748
at peace.

580
00:50:43,883 --> 00:50:46,516
Because...

581
00:50:46,518 --> 00:50:49,189
we're all together
when it happens...

582
00:50:50,556 --> 00:50:52,825
in our safe place.

583
00:50:54,893 --> 00:50:56,395
In our home.

584
00:50:59,065 --> 00:51:01,768
<i>High Hopes.</i>

585
00:51:23,621 --> 00:51:28,891
Yeah, it don't take
much to point a gun at somebody.

586
00:51:28,893 --> 00:51:33,126
But it does take some serious
balls to pull that trigger.

587
00:51:33,128 --> 00:51:36,231
You made me proud
today, son.

588
00:51:36,233 --> 00:51:38,031
But remember this,

589
00:51:38,033 --> 00:51:40,200
next time it might be you
looking down the barrel

590
00:51:40,202 --> 00:51:42,238
of that rifle.

591
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:15,236
What the hell?

592
00:52:49,702 --> 00:52:52,201
I'm fed up, Ronnie!
I don't wanna hear it no more!

593
00:52:52,203 --> 00:52:54,202
Louise, I've had that rifle
20 years.

594
00:52:54,204 --> 00:52:56,405
Never once did it misfire,
not once, okay?

595
00:52:56,407 --> 00:52:58,206
I checked the chamber.
There were two rounds in there.

596
00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:00,510
Should've blown my fucking head
off but it didn't.

597
00:53:00,512 --> 00:53:02,278
I know why now.

598
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,546
I was spared, Louise.

599
00:53:03,548 --> 00:53:05,949
That's just great,
Ronnie!

600
00:53:05,951 --> 00:53:07,617
Now it's a sign from God

601
00:53:07,619 --> 00:53:09,283
of your redemption?

602
00:53:09,285 --> 00:53:11,719
You think locking us up
in these bars

603
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:14,188
and putting statues all over
the house of the virgin Mary

604
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:16,158
is gonna make up
for all your sins?

605
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,326
You said yourself there's
something wrong with this house.

606
00:53:18,328 --> 00:53:21,330
You've always said that.
Maybe you're right.

607
00:53:21,332 --> 00:53:23,130
You really don't get it,
do you?

608
00:53:23,132 --> 00:53:26,099
It's not about
the goddamn house.

609
00:53:26,101 --> 00:53:28,436
It's about you.

610
00:53:28,438 --> 00:53:29,503
No.

611
00:53:29,505 --> 00:53:33,173
Open your eyes.

612
00:53:33,175 --> 00:53:34,474
Butch is in trouble,

613
00:53:34,476 --> 00:53:37,410
serious trouble.

614
00:53:37,412 --> 00:53:39,347
What are you gonna do about it?

615
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:41,246
I've told you
a hundred times, Louise,

616
00:53:41,248 --> 00:53:43,482
I've got the goddamn devil on
my back with that fucking kid!

617
00:53:43,484 --> 00:53:45,652
Butch is not the devil.

618
00:53:45,654 --> 00:53:50,456
He's our son. And he needs us,
now more than ever.

619
00:53:50,458 --> 00:53:52,525
Six months in basic training
with the corp,

620
00:53:52,527 --> 00:53:55,261
that's what that kid needs,
they'll make a man out of him.

621
00:53:55,263 --> 00:53:56,995
He's hooked on drugs.

622
00:53:56,997 --> 00:54:00,365
He needs professional help,

623
00:54:00,367 --> 00:54:02,167
not a goddamn drill sargeant.

624
00:54:02,169 --> 00:54:05,137
No son of mine is going
to some methadone clinic.

625
00:54:05,139 --> 00:54:08,209
I'll commit him to Bellevue
before a place like that.

626
00:54:09,744 --> 00:54:12,111
I am done
with this conversation.

627
00:54:12,113 --> 00:54:14,445
Louise, I'm talking to you.

628
00:54:14,447 --> 00:54:17,014
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

629
00:54:17,016 --> 00:54:19,384
I am going to my mother and
fathers' and bringing the kids.

630
00:54:19,386 --> 00:54:21,251
No you're not.

631
00:54:21,253 --> 00:54:24,454
I need time away from this
house, and time away from you.

632
00:54:24,456 --> 00:54:27,324
You're not gonna leave me now.
I'm under so much pressure.

633
00:54:27,326 --> 00:54:30,260
Okay, listen to me, I'm begging
you. Just listen to me, Louise.

634
00:54:30,262 --> 00:54:34,330
If I don't come up with that
money I don't know what I'll do.

635
00:54:34,332 --> 00:54:37,200
I'm sorry, okay?
Just stay and talk to me.

636
00:54:37,202 --> 00:54:39,602
Be with me now, okay?
Please, I'm begging you.

637
00:54:39,604 --> 00:54:41,138
I'm begging you,
don't go over there.

638
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:43,439
Don't go away now.

639
00:54:45,476 --> 00:54:47,610
Stay with me.

640
00:54:47,612 --> 00:54:49,478
Just...

641
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:50,780
stay with me now.

642
00:54:50,782 --> 00:54:53,385
Jesus.

643
00:54:55,753 --> 00:54:57,389
Come with me.

644
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:30,487
Butch?

645
00:55:43,363 --> 00:55:44,532
Look at this.

646
00:55:45,799 --> 00:55:48,567
Holy shit.

647
00:55:48,569 --> 00:55:50,869
Found it this morning.

648
00:55:50,871 --> 00:55:52,838
How much is there?

649
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:56,144
$50 thousand, maybe more.

650
00:55:57,311 --> 00:56:00,345
Butch, you said
you didn't take it.

651
00:56:00,347 --> 00:56:02,650
I... I didn't.

652
00:56:04,617 --> 00:56:08,384
I mean, my mind
is all twisted up.

653
00:56:08,386 --> 00:56:10,821
I can't eat,
I can't sleep.

654
00:56:10,823 --> 00:56:13,623
I just spend night

655
00:56:13,625 --> 00:56:15,659
after night

656
00:56:15,661 --> 00:56:17,564
after night...

657
00:56:18,598 --> 00:56:19,833
watching.

658
00:56:21,365 --> 00:56:23,068
Watching what?

659
00:56:26,137 --> 00:56:28,338
Watching you.

660
00:56:33,677 --> 00:56:36,546
Did you know that the natives
on this part of Long Island

661
00:56:36,548 --> 00:56:38,750
have a ritual
for burying their dead?

662
00:56:41,451 --> 00:56:43,585
Every winter...

663
00:56:43,587 --> 00:56:48,460
they would banish
all the most savage criminals,

664
00:56:49,893 --> 00:56:51,692
all the outcasts,

665
00:56:51,694 --> 00:56:55,196
all the enemies
of the tribe.

666
00:56:55,198 --> 00:56:56,731
They would tie them to trees,

667
00:56:56,733 --> 00:57:00,736
leaving them to die slowly

668
00:57:02,338 --> 00:57:04,805
from the exposure,

669
00:57:04,807 --> 00:57:06,542
starvation...

670
00:57:09,244 --> 00:57:11,146
disease...

671
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:14,183
madness.

672
00:57:15,317 --> 00:57:17,353
And then,
when they were dead...

673
00:57:18,219 --> 00:57:20,219
they would bury them,

674
00:57:20,221 --> 00:57:21,623
face down.

675
00:57:23,491 --> 00:57:27,825
Butch, look, I don't know
what's going on with you,

676
00:57:27,827 --> 00:57:29,528
but you have
to get out of here.

677
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:32,598
Did you know that everyone
in this house

678
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,836
sleeps face down?

679
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:38,906
Every single night.

680
00:57:39,906 --> 00:57:41,842
No one stirs.

681
00:57:43,976 --> 00:57:45,445
Not even a sound.

682
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:49,280
It's as if everyone

683
00:57:49,282 --> 00:57:51,719
goes to the same place...

684
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,322
shares the same dream...

685
00:57:56,754 --> 00:58:00,526
All tucked warmly
in their beds.

686
00:58:02,493 --> 00:58:04,363
So quiet...

687
00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:07,399
a calm...

688
00:58:08,634 --> 00:58:10,503
so at peace.

689
00:59:13,694 --> 00:59:16,331
Butch... Butch, look.

690
00:59:24,671 --> 00:59:26,638
Butch, we have to get
out of here.

691
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,609
Come on, let's go.

692
00:59:31,644 --> 00:59:33,009
What the fuck?!

693
00:59:33,011 --> 00:59:34,847
What have we done?

694
00:59:35,815 --> 00:59:37,581
We awakened them.

695
00:59:37,583 --> 00:59:42,920
Hey, Butch,
I overheard Daddy earlier.

696
00:59:42,922 --> 00:59:47,525
He was saying he wants to have
you locked up, committed.

697
00:59:47,527 --> 00:59:49,758
All right, we have to get you
someplace where he...

698
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:54,363
I'll be okay.
But I think you should go.

699
00:59:54,365 --> 00:59:55,765
- What?
- Tonight.

700
00:59:55,767 --> 00:59:59,401
Okay, what are you
talking about?

701
00:59:59,403 --> 01:00:01,404
I'm not going anywhere
without you.

702
01:00:01,406 --> 01:00:04,107
What do you think is gonna
happen to the kids if I'm gone?

703
01:00:04,109 --> 01:00:07,512
Don't you think he's gonna
go after them next?

704
01:00:09,447 --> 01:00:11,479
There is no way out.

705
01:00:11,481 --> 01:00:13,382
No.

706
01:00:13,384 --> 01:00:15,353
Not for any of us.

707
01:00:17,021 --> 01:00:18,789
Except you.

708
01:05:13,231 --> 01:05:15,234
He's dangerous.

709
01:06:19,794 --> 01:06:22,129
Go away!

710
01:06:37,776 --> 01:06:40,813
Go away!

711
01:06:41,814 --> 01:06:43,950
Leave me alone!

712
01:06:50,188 --> 01:06:52,188
Leave me alone!

713
01:07:01,798 --> 01:07:04,035
Go away!

714
01:09:13,021 --> 01:09:14,855
What if he refuses
to go?

715
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:20,493
- He's not gonna cooperate.
- He's lost his mind.

716
01:09:20,495 --> 01:09:23,331
We'll have
to restrain him.

717
01:09:23,333 --> 01:09:26,566
I'm telling you,
it's either us or him.

718
01:09:26,568 --> 01:09:29,268
I already mixed in
a sedative.

719
01:09:31,006 --> 01:09:33,042
I'm getting him
out of this house.

720
01:09:35,343 --> 01:09:37,309
What if
he refuses to go?

721
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:45,049
I've got
the devil on my back.

722
01:09:45,051 --> 01:09:48,353
We might have
to restrain him.

723
01:09:48,355 --> 01:09:50,858
Does everybody
know what to do?

724
01:09:55,429 --> 01:09:58,162
Do not let him know
what we're planning.

725
01:09:58,164 --> 01:10:01,068
I think
I hear him coming.

726
01:10:07,173 --> 01:10:09,073
We were getting worried
about you, son.

727
01:10:09,075 --> 01:10:10,941
You've been sleeping
all day.

728
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:12,609
Huh? You must
be hungry, son.

729
01:10:12,611 --> 01:10:15,945
Come on, join us for some
supper, what do you say?

730
01:10:15,947 --> 01:10:17,381
Got my cast off today.

731
01:10:17,383 --> 01:10:20,050
Looks like I can
beat you up, again.

732
01:10:20,052 --> 01:10:21,618
Says someone
who fell down the stairs.

733
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:22,953
You pushed me.

734
01:10:22,955 --> 01:10:24,921
- I did not.
- Yes you did.

735
01:10:24,923 --> 01:10:28,157
Go ahead, take your coat off,
son, have some dinner, come on.

736
01:10:28,159 --> 01:10:30,358
Butch, come sit down, baby.

737
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:32,497
I made you
your favorite dish.

738
01:10:34,665 --> 01:10:37,332
Hey Butch, any idea where
your sister might have gone?

739
01:10:37,334 --> 01:10:41,136
- No sir.
- I'm sure she'll be back soon.

740
01:10:41,138 --> 01:10:43,938
Why don't we just enjoy
our last meal together?

741
01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:49,279
Jody, would you like to lead
the family in grace?

742
01:10:54,184 --> 01:10:56,284
Thank you for our home so sweet;

743
01:10:56,286 --> 01:10:58,219
Thank you for the food we eat;

744
01:10:58,221 --> 01:11:00,454
Thank you for the birds
that sing;

745
01:11:00,456 --> 01:11:01,989
Thank you God for everything.

746
01:11:01,991 --> 01:11:05,359
Amen.

747
01:11:05,361 --> 01:11:06,595
That was lovely.

748
01:11:07,429 --> 01:11:09,164
Shall we eat?

749
01:11:19,074 --> 01:11:22,044
Some storm
we have tonight, huh?

750
01:11:24,745 --> 01:11:26,614
Want some?

751
01:11:31,052 --> 01:11:32,453
No. No!

752
01:11:35,188 --> 01:11:36,321
God...!

753
01:11:36,323 --> 01:11:37,723
It's just a storm.

754
01:11:39,726 --> 01:11:41,492
- Go away.
- Butch.

755
01:11:41,494 --> 01:11:43,060
Go away!

756
01:11:43,062 --> 01:11:45,499
Butch, calm down.
What's wrong with you?

757
01:11:46,499 --> 01:11:47,666
Leave us alone!

758
01:11:47,668 --> 01:11:49,636
Come on.

759
01:11:51,337 --> 01:11:53,403
Whoa. Put down the knife.
You're gonna...

760
01:11:53,405 --> 01:11:54,505
Everybody stay back!

761
01:11:54,507 --> 01:11:55,706
Whoa whoa whoa.

762
01:11:55,708 --> 01:11:57,477
You're gonna hurt yourself.

763
01:12:04,716 --> 01:12:06,552
Crazy son of a...

764
01:12:13,190 --> 01:12:14,993
Leave me alone!

765
01:12:17,229 --> 01:12:18,364
Go away!

766
01:12:19,464 --> 01:12:21,030
Butch, don't be afraid.

767
01:12:21,032 --> 01:12:22,467
Where do you think
you're going?

768
01:13:32,232 --> 01:13:34,699
Sorry to show up
so late, Nona.

769
01:13:34,701 --> 01:13:38,503
Oh, the storm's
getting closer.

770
01:13:38,505 --> 01:13:40,673
I had to get out
of there, Nona.

771
01:13:42,474 --> 01:13:45,178
There's something really wrong
with that house.

772
01:13:46,245 --> 01:13:48,611
You've always known

773
01:13:48,613 --> 01:13:50,482
that the house is...

774
01:13:51,517 --> 01:13:52,615
special.

775
01:13:52,617 --> 01:13:55,487
But what is it
about the house?

776
01:13:56,553 --> 01:13:58,421
When I met your grandfather

777
01:13:58,423 --> 01:14:02,757
he had big ideas
and big dreams

778
01:14:02,759 --> 01:14:04,659
and he worked hard.

779
01:14:04,661 --> 01:14:08,363
When your mother was born
he took me out to Long Island.

780
01:14:08,365 --> 01:14:11,702
He was already working
two jobs.

781
01:14:12,836 --> 01:14:14,835
But...

782
01:14:14,837 --> 01:14:18,372
he scrapped together
enough money

783
01:14:18,374 --> 01:14:20,541
to buy a small parcel

784
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:23,210
in Amityville.

785
01:14:23,212 --> 01:14:27,249
He felt a strong
connection there, we both did.

786
01:14:27,251 --> 01:14:30,718
He bought the land
from a wealthy man

787
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:32,453
named Moynahan.

788
01:14:32,455 --> 01:14:36,690
My Michael spent the next year
building our house,

789
01:14:36,692 --> 01:14:38,459
your house.

790
01:14:38,461 --> 01:14:43,796
It was everything
he ever wanted for his family.

791
01:14:43,798 --> 01:14:48,434
And that's why we named it
High Hopes.

792
01:14:48,436 --> 01:14:52,704
Over time, we attained a life
of certain means.

793
01:14:52,706 --> 01:14:54,774
The house took care of us,

794
01:14:54,776 --> 01:14:59,279
and we took care of it,
you see?

795
01:14:59,281 --> 01:15:03,916
But Nona, the house,
whatever lives there,

796
01:15:03,918 --> 01:15:06,318
it makes things happen,

797
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:07,755
bad things.

798
01:15:09,255 --> 01:15:10,521
Were you reading
from the book?

799
01:15:10,523 --> 01:15:13,725
Nona, we were just playing.

800
01:15:13,727 --> 01:15:15,492
Just like you taught us
when we were small.

801
01:15:15,494 --> 01:15:18,929
Conjoration isn't a game,
<i>bambolina.</i>

802
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:20,533
You know this.

803
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:23,267
Now come on,

804
01:15:23,269 --> 01:15:24,669
tell Nona everything.

805
01:15:34,779 --> 01:15:36,548
I'm afraid, Nona.

806
01:15:37,548 --> 01:15:39,918
It feels like we're being...

807
01:15:40,652 --> 01:15:43,285
haunted.

808
01:15:43,287 --> 01:15:46,556
We're all haunted
by something,

809
01:15:46,558 --> 01:15:48,490
by our past,

810
01:15:48,492 --> 01:15:50,595
by our mistakes...

811
01:15:51,295 --> 01:15:52,293
by our sins.

812
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,299
Shhh.

813
01:15:58,301 --> 01:16:00,839
You'll be safe here
with Nona tonight.

814
01:20:59,584 --> 01:21:01,921
Bogeyman?

815
01:22:53,757 --> 01:22:55,693
Where are you going, child?

816
01:22:56,728 --> 01:22:57,759
Home.

817
01:22:57,761 --> 01:22:59,863
I'm going home.

818
01:23:01,063 --> 01:23:03,263
It's not safe for you
out there,

819
01:23:03,265 --> 01:23:07,735
not tonight,
not with this storm outside.

820
01:23:07,737 --> 01:23:09,773
What have you done to us, Nona?

821
01:23:10,974 --> 01:23:12,339
They are angry.

822
01:23:12,341 --> 01:23:16,846
Dawn, please don't go back
to that house!

823
01:25:42,281 --> 01:25:43,881
Mom?

824
01:25:43,883 --> 01:25:45,251
Dad?

825
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:57,029
No!

826
01:26:07,373 --> 01:26:09,273
Oh my God!

827
01:26:09,275 --> 01:26:12,111
No! Allison!

828
01:26:13,444 --> 01:26:15,380
Allison!

829
01:26:20,284 --> 01:26:22,354
Oh my God.

830
01:26:23,988 --> 01:26:25,257
No.

831
01:26:35,232 --> 01:26:37,231
Oh my God! Butch.

832
01:26:37,233 --> 01:26:40,502
What are you...?
What are you doing?

833
01:26:40,504 --> 01:26:44,238
Please. Butch, don't.
You have to help me.

834
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:46,309
Butch, what are you doing?

835
01:26:48,443 --> 01:26:52,182
Please, Butch, you have to.
Please.

836
01:26:53,049 --> 01:26:55,048
Please stop!

837
01:26:55,050 --> 01:26:57,019
No!

838
01:26:59,387 --> 01:27:00,619
Butch, don't.

839
01:27:00,621 --> 01:27:02,322
Please, don't!

840
01:27:02,324 --> 01:27:04,556
You don't have
to do it to me.

841
01:27:04,558 --> 01:27:07,359
Butch! No!

842
01:27:07,361 --> 01:27:11,064
Please, Butch,
you don't have to do this!

843
01:27:11,066 --> 01:27:13,969
Stop! Butch, no!

844
01:27:27,081 --> 01:27:28,283
No!

845
01:27:37,090 --> 01:27:40,624
<i>There's no way out,
Dawn...</i>

846
01:27:40,626 --> 01:27:43,460
- <i>I see rain...</i>
- <i>...not for any of us.</i>

847
01:27:43,462 --> 01:27:45,062

<i>There's no way out.</i>

849
01:27:46,532 --> 01:27:48,464
<i>And when
it's all over...</i>

850
01:27:48,466 --> 01:27:50,102
<i>There's no way out.</i>

851
01:27:51,335 --> 01:27:54,137
<i>...I feel at peace.</i>

852
01:27:54,139 --> 01:27:56,038
<i>What did they used
to tell us?</i>

853
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:58,173
<i>How we would always
live here.</i>

854
01:27:58,175 --> 01:28:01,378
<i>There's no way out, Dawn.</i>

855
01:28:01,380 --> 01:28:04,646
<i>We're all together
when it happens...</i>

856
01:28:04,648 --> 01:28:06,381
<i>in our safe place.</i>

857
01:28:06,383 --> 01:28:08,283
<i>What did they used
to tell us?</i>

858
01:28:08,285 --> 01:28:10,286
<i>That we would
always live here.</i>

859
01:28:10,288 --> 01:28:12,057
<i>...in our home.</i>

860
01:28:13,924 --> 01:28:16,460
<i>High Hopes.</i>

Now I lay me down to sleep;

862
01:28:42,016 --> 01:28:45,087
I pray the Lord
my soul to keep;

863
01:28:46,354 --> 01:28:50,425
And if I die before I wake;

864
01:28:51,658 --> 01:28:53,993
I pray the Lord

865
01:28:53,995 --> 01:28:56,131
my soul to take

866
01:29:09,576 --> 01:29:11,212
Dawn?

867
01:29:16,049 --> 01:29:17,551
Dawn?

868
