2
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,659
13 meters. You should see it.

3
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,715
Okay, take her up and over the bow rail.

4
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:19,513
Mir 2, we're going over the bow.
Stay with us.

5
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,716
Okay, quiet. We're rolling.

6
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,511
Seeing her coming out of the
darkness like a ghost ship...

7
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:01,430
still gets me every time.

8
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:07,019
To see the sad ruin of the
great ship sitting here...

9
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,688
where she landed at
2:30 in the morning

10
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,899
of April 15, 1912...

11
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,526
after her long fall...

12
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,321
from the world above.

13
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,406
You are so full of shit, boss.

14
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:53,607
Dive 6. Here we are again
on the deck of Titanic.

15
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,903
21/2 miles down. 3,821 meters.

16
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:03,242
The pressure outside is
31/2 tons per square inch.

17
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,744
These windows are
9 inches thick.

18
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:09,665
If they go, it's sayonara
in two microseconds.

19
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,626
All right, enough of that bullshit.

20
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:29,977
Just put her down on the roof of
the officers' quarters like yesterday.

21
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:35,941
Mir 2, we're landing right over the
Grand Staircase. You guys set to launch?

22
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,695
Yeah, Brock. Launching Dunkin now.
Go, Charlie.

23
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,621
- All right, tether out.
- Tether out.

24
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:53,500
Okay, Brock, we're dropping
down along the hull.

25
00:04:56,129 --> 00:05:00,132
Yeah, roger that. Okay, drop down and go
into the first class gangway door.

26
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,050
I want you guys working the D deck...

27
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,678
reception area and the dining saloon.

28
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,471
Copy that.

29
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,856
Tether out. Okay, now left. Left, left.
Okay, coming left.

30
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:28,702
Snoop Dog is on the move.
We're headed down the stairwell.

31
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,290
Okay Lewis, drop down to B deck.

32
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,126
- Okay, A deck.
- Give me some rope, Captain.

33
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,961
B deck. Get in there. Get in there.

34
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,585
Watch the door frame.

35
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,420
- Watch it, watch it.
- I see it. I got it.

36
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,844
- We good? Bring her down.
- We're good. Just chill, boss.

37
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,444
Okay, make your turn.

38
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,197
- Cable out, Captain.
- Make your turn. Watch the wall.

39
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,825
Yeah Brock, we're at the piano.
You copy?

40
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,952
Okay, copy that.

41
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,545
Okay, right there. Right there.

42
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,338
Okay, that's it, that's it.
That's the bedroom door.

43
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,923
I see it. I see it.

44
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,100
We're in!

45
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,519
We're in, baby. We're there.

46
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,564
That's Hockley's bed.

47
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,816
That's where the
son of a bitch slept.

48
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:31,324
Oops. Somebody left the water running.

49
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,077
Hold it. Hold it just a second.
Go back to the right.

50
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,003
That wardrobe door. Get closer.

51
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,754
You smelling something, boss?

52
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:48,175
- I want to see what's under it.
- Give me my hands, man.

53
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,182
All right.

54
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,768
- Take it easy. It might come apart.
- Okay.

55
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:03,440
Go, go, go. Flip it over.
Flip it over. Go.

56
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,317
Turn her over. Keep going.

57
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,776
Go, go, go.

58
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,195
Okay, drop it.

59
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:20,540
Oh, baby, baby.
Are you seeing this, boss?

60
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,462
It's payday, boys.

61
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,938
Cha-ching!

62
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,649
- We did it, Bobby.
- We brought it back, Baby.

63
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:48,985
Oh, yeah! Who's the best?
Who's the best, baby?

64
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,321
Say it. Say it. Say it.

65
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,323
You are, Lewis.

66
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,910
- Bobby, my cigar.
- Right here.

67
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:06,836
Okay, crack her open.

68
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:37,951
Shit.

69
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:41,705
No diamond.

70
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:47,460
You know boss, this same thing happened
to Geraldo and his career never recovered.

71
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:52,882
Turn the camera off.

72
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,719
Brock, the partners would like
to know how it's going.

73
00:09:57,221 --> 00:10:01,224
Hey, Dave, Barry, hi. Look, I it wasn't
in the safe. But hey, hey...

74
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:05,061
Don't worry about it. There's still
plenty of places it could be. Hell, yes.

75
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,689
The floor debris in the suite,
the mother's room...

76
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:08,940
the purser's safe on C deck.

77
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,317
Jimmy Hoffa's briefcase.

78
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:15,405
A dozen other places. Guys, look, you're just going
to have to trust my instincts. I know we're close.

79
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:17,991
We've just got to go through a little
process of elimination.

80
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,077
Hang on a second.

81
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,999
- Let me see that.
- We may have something here, guys.

82
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,504
Where's the photograph
of the necklace?

83
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,589
We'll call you right back.

84
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,436
I'll be goddamned.

85
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,859
Treasure hunter Brock Lovett
is best known for finding Spanish gold...

86
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,778
It's okay. I'll feed you in a minute.

87
00:10:55,112 --> 00:11:00,116
Now he has chartered Russian subs to reach the
most famous shipwreck of all, the Titanic.

88
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:04,287
He is with us live via satellite
from the research ship Keldysh...

89
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,706
in the North Atlantic. Hello. Brock.

90
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:10,960
Hello, Tracy. Of course, everyone knows
the familiar stories of Titanic.

91
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:14,214
You know, the nobility of the
band playing to the very end and all that.

92
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:18,968
But what I'm interested in are the untold stories.
The secrets locked deep inside the hull of Titanic.

93
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,223
And we're out here using robot
technology to go further into the wreck...

94
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,141
than anybody has ever done before.

95
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:28,645
Your expedition is at the center
of a storm of controversy...

96
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:32,899
over salvage rights and even ethics.
Many are calling you a graverobber.

97
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,984
Well, nobody ever called the
recovery of the artifacts...

98
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,236
What is it?

99
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,154
Turn that up, dear.

100
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:41,157
I have museum-trained experts
sent out here making sure...

101
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:44,077
that these relics are preserved
and catalogued properly.

102
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:47,080
Take a look at this drawing
that we found just today.

103
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:50,834
A piece of paper that's been underwater
for 84 years.

104
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,670
And my team are able to
preserve it intact.

105
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:57,340
Should this have remained unseen
at the bottom of the ocean for eternity...

106
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,592
when we can see and enjoy it now?

107
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,678
I'll be goddamned.

108
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,099
Brock!

109
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,351
There's a satellite call for you.

110
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:11,938
Bobby, we're launching. You see
these submersibles going in the water?

111
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,607
Trust me, buddy.
You want to take this call.

112
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,777
This better be good.

113
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,780
Now, you gotta speak up.
She's kind of old.

114
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,198
Great.

115
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,453
This is Brock Lovett.
How can I help you, Mrs...?

116
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,705
Calvert. Rose Calvert.

117
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:29,831
Mrs. Calvert.

118
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,793
I was just wondering if you had found...

119
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:36,045
the "Heart of the
Ocean" yet, Mr. Lovett.

120
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,133
Told you you wanted to take the call.

121
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:45,388
All right, you have my
attention, Rose.

122
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,974
Can you tell us who the woman
in the picture is?

123
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:51,728
Oh, yes. The woman in the picture is me.

124
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:12,332
She's a goddamn liar!
Some nutcase seeking money or publicity.

125
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,419
God only knows why.
Like that Russian babe, Anesthesia.

126
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,588
They're inbound!

127
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:27,514
Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the
Titanic when she was 17, right?

128
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:31,267
- That's right.
- If she had lived, she'd be over 100 by now.

129
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,770
101 next month.

130
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:36,940
Okay, so she's a very old goddamn liar.

131
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,359
Look, I've already done the
background on this woman...

132
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,446
all the way back to the 20s,
when she was working as an actress.

133
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,616
An actress.
There's your first clue, Sherlock.

134
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:51,246
Her name was Rose Dawson back then.
Then she marries this guy named Calvert.

135
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:54,791
They move to Cedar Rapids
and she punches out a couple of kids.

136
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,294
Now Calvert's dead and, from what
I hear, Cedar Rapids is dead.

137
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,880
And everybody who knows about the
diamond is supposed to be dead...

138
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,091
or on this boat, but she knows.

139
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,065
Doesn't exactly travel light, does she?

140
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:20,483
Hurry up, give him a hand.

141
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:24,904
Mrs. Calvert, I'm Brock Lovett.
Welcome to the Keldysh.

142
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,992
Okay, let's get her inside there.

143
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:30,493
Hi, Miss Calvert.

144
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,745
- Hi.
- Welcome to the Keldysh.

145
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:34,831
Thanks.

146
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,500
Hey!

147
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,093
Are your staterooms all right?

148
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,177
Oh, yes.

149
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,345
Very nice.

150
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,598
Have you met my
granddaughter, Lizzy?

151
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,308
She takes care of me.

152
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,311
We met just a few minutes ago.

153
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,645
Remember, Nana? Up on deck?

154
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,022
Oh, yes.

155
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,608
There. That's nice.

156
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,527
Have to have my
pictures when I travel.

157
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:05,695
Can I get you anything?

158
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,030
Is there anything you'd like?

159
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:09,782
Yes.

160
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,619
I would like to see my drawing.

161
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:29,385
Louis XVI wore a fabulous
stone that was...

162
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,179
called the Blue Diamond
of the Crown...

163
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:34,140
which disappeared in 1792...

164
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:38,061
about the same time old Louis lost
everything from the neck up.

165
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:42,148
The theory goes that the
crown diamond was chopped, too.

166
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,651
Recut into a heart-like shape that
became known as...

167
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,861
the Heart of the Ocean.

168
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,739
Today it would be worth
more than the Hope diamond.

169
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,158
It was a dreadful, heavy thing.

170
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,494
I only wore it this once.

171
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,080
You actually think
this is you, Nana?

172
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,207
It is me, dear.

173
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,209
Wasn't I a dish?

174
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:05,922
I tracked it down
through insurance records.

175
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:09,926
An old claim that was settled
under terms of absolute secrecy.

176
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:13,680
Can you tell me who the
claimant was, Rose?

177
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,599
I should imagine someone
named Hockley.

178
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:18,643
Nathan Hockley, that's right.

179
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,104
Pittsburgh steel tycoon.

180
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,731
The claim was for a
diamond necklace his son...

181
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,274
Caledon, bought his fiancée.

182
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:26,693
You.

183
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,362
A week before he
sailed on Titanic.

184
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,699
And it was filed right
after the sinking.

185
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,619
So the diamond had to have
gone down with the ship.

186
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:39,205
You see the date?

187
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,709
April 14, 1912.

188
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,878
Which means if your grandmother
is who she says she is...

189
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,798
she was wearing the diamond
the day the Titanic sank.

190
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:52,176
And that makes you
my new best friend.

191
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,179
These are some of the things
we recovered from your stateroom.

192
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,560
This was mine.

193
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,896
How extraordinary.

194
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:07,984
And it looks the same as it
did the last time I saw it.

195
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,242
The reflection has
changed a bit.

196
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,428
Are you ready to go
back to Titanic?

197
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,183
Okay, here we go.

198
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:43,478
She hits the berg on
the starboard side, right?

199
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,562
She kind of bumps along...

200
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:45,897
punching holes like
morse code...

201
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,440
ditdit-dit... along the side...

202
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:48,524
below the water line.

203
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:52,278
Then the forward compartments
start to flood.

204
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:53,654
Now, as the water
level rises...

205
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,656
it spills over the
watertight bulkheads...

206
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,534
which, unfortunately, don't go
any higher than E deck.

207
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,369
So now as the bow goes down...

208
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,122
the stern rises up,
slow at first...

209
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,791
then faster and faster...

210
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,293
until finally, she's got her whole
ass sticking up in the air.

211
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,337
And that's a big ass.

212
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,298
We're talking
20, 30,000 tons. Okay?

213
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,634
And the hull's not designed
to deal with that pressure.

214
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,427
So, what happens?

215
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,596
She splits, right
down to the keel.

216
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,680
And the stern...

217
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,140
falls back level.

218
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,225
Then...

219
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,309
as the bow sinks...

220
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,311
it pulls the stern vertical...

221
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,563
and then finally detaches.

222
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:31,651
Now the stern section just kind of bobs there
like a cork for a couple of minutes...

223
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:35,071
floods, and finally goes
under about 2:20 AM...

224
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:37,490
2 hours and 40 minutes
after the collision.

225
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,326
The bow section planes away...

226
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,287
landing about a
half a mile away...

227
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,373
going 20, 30 knots when
it hits the ocean floor.

228
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,254
Pretty cool?

229
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:55,842
Thank you for that fine
forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.

230
00:18:56,677 --> 00:19:00,012
Of course, the
experience of it was...

231
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,515
somewhat different.

232
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:05,017
Will you share it with us?

233
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:00,990
I'm taking her to rest.

234
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,074
No.

235
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,409
Come on, Nana.

236
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,827
No!

237
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,583
Give me the tape recorder.

238
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:14,754
Tell us, Rose.

239
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,925
It's been 84 years...

240
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,052
It's okay. Just try
to remember anything...

241
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,637
anything at all.

242
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,599
Do you want to hear this
or not, Mr. Lovett?

243
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:33,606
It's been 84 years...

244
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:38,444
and I can still smell
the fresh paint.

245
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,074
The china had never been used.

246
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:46,452
The sheets had
never been slept in.

247
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:52,041
Titanic was called
the ship of dreams.

248
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:54,710
And it was.

249
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,672
It really was.

250
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,412
All third-class passengers...

251
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,622
with a forward berth...

252
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:34,041
this way please! This queue!

253
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,085
It's a big boat?

254
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,296
Daddy, it's a ship.

255
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,422
You're right.

256
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,412
I don't see what all
the fuss is about.

257
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,040
It doesn't look any bigger
than the Mauretania.

258
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,958
You can be blasé
about some things, Rose...

259
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,877
but not about Titanic.

260
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,837
It's over 100 feet longer
than Mauretania...

261
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:21,464
and far more luxurious.

262
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,759
Your daughter is far too
difficult to impress, Ruth.

263
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,012
So this is the ship they
say is unsinkable.

264
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,138
It is unsinkable.

265
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,639
God Himself
could not sink this ship...

266
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:31,766
What?!

267
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,351
You have to check your baggage
through the main terminal.

268
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,643
It's round that way, sir.

269
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,479
I put my faith in you good sir.

270
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:37,688
Now kindly see my man.

271
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,023
Yes sir. It's my pleasure, sir.

272
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,149
If I can do anything at all...

273
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,567
Yes, right.

274
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,819
All the trunks from
that car there.

275
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,946
12 from here.

276
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:49,075
And the safe,
to the parlor suite...

277
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,910
rooms B-52, 54, 56.

278
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:54,246
Ladies...

279
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,082
we better hurry.

280
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,375
Come along.

281
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,130
- My coat?
- I have it, miss.

282
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:10,554
All third-class passengers
queue here for health inspection.

283
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,230
- Welcome aboard, ma'am.
- Welcome to Titanic.

284
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,525
It was the ship of dreams...

285
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:23,984
to everyone else.

286
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:27,279
To me. It was a slave ship...

287
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:30,783
taking me back to
America in chains.

288
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:35,788
Outwardly, I was everything
a well brought up girl should be.

289
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,624
Inside, I was screaming.

290
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,392
Jack, you are pazzo.

291
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:58,310
You bet everything we have.

292
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,647
When you got nothing,
you got nothing to lose.

293
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:10,114
Sven?

294
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:34,180
All right, moment of truth.

295
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:36,682
Someone's life is
about to change.

296
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,058
Fabrizio?

297
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:42,521
Niente.

298
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:44,690
Olaf?

299
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:46,859
Nothing.

300
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,360
Sven?

301
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,866
2 pair.

302
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:56,118
I'm sorry, Fabrizio.

303
00:24:58,288 --> 00:24:59,330
I'm sorry...

304
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,664
you're not gonna see
your mom again for a...

305
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,708
Long time...

306
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,460
'cause we're going to America.

307
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:05,836
Full house, boys!

308
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,227
Come on.

309
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:23,729
I'm going home!

310
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,150
I'm going home.

311
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:29,610
I go to America!

312
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,237
No, mate.

313
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:33,489
Titanic go to America,

314
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:35,074
in 5 minutes.

315
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:36,617
Shit. Fabri. Come on.

316
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:37,743
Come on, here. Here.

317
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:41,956
We're riding in high style now!

318
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,500
We're a couple of
regular swells.

319
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,293
We're practically
goddamn royalty...

320
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,378
ragazzo mio.

321
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,588
You see? Is my destino.

322
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,131
Like I told you...

323
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,967
I go to America to
be millionaire.

324
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,346
You are pazzo.

325
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,181
Maybe, but I've
got the tickets.

326
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:02,518
Come on, I thought
you were fast.

327
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:03,602
Aspetta!

328
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:05,604
Wait! Wait!

329
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:06,689
Hey, wait!

330
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,232
We're passengers!

331
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,403
Have you been through
the inspection queue?

332
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:13,487
Of course.

333
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,030
Anyway, we don't have any lice.

334
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,032
We're Americans. Both of us.

335
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,117
Right.

336
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,201
Come aboard.

337
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:25,124
We're the luckiest sons
of bitches in the world.

338
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:26,166
You know that?

339
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,385
Good-bye!

340
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,473
You know somebody?

341
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,058
Of course not.
That's not the point.

342
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,643
Good-bye! I'll miss you!

343
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,103
Good-bye!

344
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,272
I will never forget you!

345
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:38,489
Come with me,
darling. Let's go.

346
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,368
G-60.

347
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,037
G-60. G-60.

348
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:46,455
Excuse me, ma'am.

349
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,707
G-60.

350
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,710
Oh, right here.

351
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,295
Hey, how you doing?

352
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,422
Jack. Nice to meet you.

353
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,216
Jack Dawson. Nice to meet you.

354
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:58,676
How you doing?

355
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,720
Who says you get top bunk?

356
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,478
This is your private
promenade deck, sir.

357
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:11,855
Will you be requiring anything?

358
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,399
Excuse me.

359
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,484
- This one?
- No.

360
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,986
It had a lot of faces on it.

361
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,905
This is the one.

362
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:23,409
Would you like all of
them out, miss?

363
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:26,912
Yes. We need a little
color in this room.

364
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,959
Put in there. In the wardrobe.

365
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:35,170
God, not those finger
paintings again.

366
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:36,839
They certainly were a
waste of money.

367
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,924
The difference between
Cal's taste in art...

368
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,592
and mine is that I have some.

369
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:41,677
They're fascinating.

370
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:45,180
Like being inside a dream
or something.

371
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:46,765
There's truth but no logic.

372
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:49,852
- What's the artist's name?
- Something Picasso.

373
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,311
Something Picasso.

374
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,147
He won't amount to a thing.

375
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,481
He won't, trust me.

376
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:57,025
- Let's put the Degas in the bedroom.
- At least they were cheap.

377
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,611
Put it in the wardrobe.

378
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:09,455
At Cherbourg, a woman came aboard
named Margaret Brown.

379
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,457
We all called her Molly.

380
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:14,960
History would call her
the Unsinkable Molly Brown.

381
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,421
Well, I wasn't about to
wait all day for you, sonny.

382
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:19,673
Here, if you think
you can manage.

383
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,302
Her husband had struck gold
someplace out west.

384
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:26,430
And she was what Mother
called "new money."

385
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,932
By the next afternoon...

386
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,727
we were steaming west
from the coast of Ireland...

387
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:36,106
with nothing out ahead
of us but ocean.

388
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:44,490
Take her to sea, Mr. Murdoch.

389
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:46,617
Let's stretch her legs.

390
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:48,076
Yes sir.

391
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,371
All ahead full, Mr. Moody.

392
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,165
Very good, sir.

393
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,755
All ahead full.

394
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,882
All ahead full!

395
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:03,926
Come on lads, step lively!

396
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:24,571
All right! Let's stoke
her right up!

397
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:25,989
We go full ahead!

398
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,325
Come on, put your
backs into it!

399
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,923
21 knots, sir.

400
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:34,850
Hey, look, look, look!

401
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:39,438
See it?

402
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,776
There's another one! See him?

403
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,955
Look at that one!
Look at him jump!

404
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:25,817
I can see the Statue
of Liberty already.

405
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:27,569
Very small, of course.

406
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:33,992
I'm the king of the world!

407
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:23,041
She is the largest moving object
ever made by the hand of man...

408
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:25,293
in all history.

409
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:27,754
And our master shipbuilder,
Mr. Andrews here...

410
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,715
designed her from the
keel plates up.

411
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,925
I may have knocked
her together, but...

412
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,177
the idea was Mr. Ismay's.

413
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:37,014
He envisioned a steamer
so grand in scale...

414
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,140
and so luxurious in...

415
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:39,266
its appointments...

416
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,476
that its supremacy
would never be challenged.

417
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:43,145
And here she is.

418
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:46,690
- Willed into solid reality.
- Hear, hear.

419
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,401
I'll have the salmon.

420
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,906
You know I don't
like that, Rose.

421
00:33:58,411 --> 00:33:59,745
She knows.

422
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:04,082
We'll both have the lamb.

423
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:06,334
Rare, with very
little mint sauce.

424
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,004
You like lamb, right sweet pea?

425
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:13,842
You gonna cut her meat
for her too there, Cal?

426
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:19,264
Hey, who thought of
the name Titanic?

427
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,099
Was it you, Bruce?

428
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:22,601
Yes, actually.

429
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:27,606
I wanted to convey sheer size.
And size means stability...

430
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:31,109
luxury, and above
all, strength.

431
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:34,446
Do you know of
Dr. Freud, Mr. Ismay?

432
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:39,034
His ideas about the male preoccupation with
size might be of particular interest to you.

433
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,787
What's gotten into you?

434
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,371
Excuse me.

435
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,294
I do apologize.

436
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:51,588
She's a pistol, Cal.
Hope you can handle her.

437
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:56,218
Well, I may have to start minding what she
reads from now on, won't I, Mrs. Brown?

438
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:59,387
Freud? Who is he?
Is he a passenger?

439
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:13,527
The ship is nice?

440
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:15,529
Yeah. It's an Irish ship.

441
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:16,655
Is English, no?

442
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:17,781
No, it was built in Ireland.

443
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:19,699
15,000 Irishmen
built this ship.

444
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:22,536
Solid as a rock.
Big Irish hands.

445
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,204
That's typical.

446
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:27,374
First-class dogs
come down here to take a shite.

447
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,168
Lets us know where we rank
in the scheme of things.

448
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,045
Like we could forget?

449
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:34,881
I'm Tommy Ryan.

450
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:37,217
- Jack Dawson.
- Fabrizio.

451
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,846
Do you make any money
with your drawings?

452
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:53,567
Forget it, boyo.

453
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,902
You'd as like have angels fly out of
your arse as get next to...

454
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,571
the likes of her.

455
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:24,931
I saw my whole life
as if I'd already lived it.

456
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:28,768
An endless parade
of parties and cotillions...

457
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:31,104
yachts and polo matches.

458
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:36,443
Always the same narrow people,
the same mindless chatter.

459
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:40,780
I felt like I was standing
at a great precipice...

460
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:45,619
with no one to pull me back.
No one who cared...

461
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:48,121
or even noticed.

462
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:39,691
Don't do it.

463
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,068
Stay back.

464
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,070
Don't come any closer.

465
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:46,865
Come on.

466
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,325
Just give me your hand.
I'll pull you back over.

467
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:49,743
No! Stay where you are.

468
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:52,078
I mean it.

469
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,414
I'll let go.

470
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:06,926
No, you won't.

471
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,263
What do you mean, no I won't?

472
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:13,224
Don't presume to tell me
what I will and will not do.

473
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,434
You don't know me.

474
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,770
Well, you would have done it already.

475
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,606
You're distracting me. Go away.

476
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,107
I can't.

477
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:22,525
I'm involved now.

478
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:26,780
You let go, and I'm going to have
to jump in there after you.

479
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,116
Don't be absurd.

480
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,619
- You'll be killed.
- I'm a good swimmer.

481
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:34,788
The fall alone will kill you.

482
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:38,291
It would hurt. I'm not
saying it wouldn't.

483
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,085
Tell you the truth...

484
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:43,213
I'm a lot more concerned
about that water being so cold.

485
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:51,596
How cold?

486
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:55,141
Freezing.
Maybe a couple degrees over.

487
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:00,647
You ever...

488
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,732
ever been to Wisconsin?

489
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:07,153
What?

490
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:09,656
Well, they have some of
the coldest winters around.

491
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:12,826
I grew up there,
near Chippewa Falls.

492
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,830
I remember when I was a kid,
me and my father, we went ice fishing...

493
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,998
out on Lake Wissota.

494
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:20,834
Ice fishing is, you know, where you...

495
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:22,752
I know what ice fishing is!

496
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:25,171
Sorry.

497
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:30,009
You just seem like, you know,
kind of an indoor girl.

498
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:33,346
Anyway, I...

499
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,349
fell through some thin ice.

500
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,184
And I'm telling you...

501
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,187
water that cold,

502
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:43,189
like right down there...

503
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:47,318
it hits you like 1000 knives
stabbing you all over your body.

504
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,155
You can't breathe.

505
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:55,660
You can't think. Least not about
anything but the pain.

506
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,958
Which is why I'm not looking
forward to jumping in there after you.

507
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:04,043
Like I said...

508
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,547
I don't have a choice.

509
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,554
I guess I'm kind of hoping you'll
come back over the rail and...

510
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,055
and get me off the hook here.

511
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,224
You're crazy.

512
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,728
That's what everybody says but...

513
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,898
with all due respect, miss...

514
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,734
I'm not the one hanging off
the back of a ship here.

515
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:29,903
Come on.

516
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,238
Come on, give me your hand.

517
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,407
You don't want to do this.

518
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:51,925
I'm Jack Dawson.

519
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:55,094
Rose DeWitt Bukater.

520
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:57,096
I'll have to get you to
write that one down.

521
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,767
Come on.

522
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,065
I got you.

523
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:10,276
Come on.

524
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,074
Help, please!

525
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,951
Help!

526
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:20,453
- Please, help me!
- Listen. Listen to me.

527
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,121
Listen. Listen to me.

528
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:23,957
I've got you. I won't let go.

529
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,251
Now pull yourself up. Come on!

530
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:30,296
Come on.

531
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,589
That's right.

532
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:33,216
You can do it.

533
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:39,472
I got you.

534
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:46,646
What's all this?

535
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:53,653
You stand back and...

536
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,405
don't move an inch!

537
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:58,866
Fetch the Master at Arms.

538
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:03,079
This is completely unacceptable!

539
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:05,999
What made you think that you could
put your hands on my fiancée?!

540
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:08,835
Look at me, you filth!

541
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:10,169
Cal.

542
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:11,462
What do you think
you were doing?

543
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:14,173
Cal, stop. It was an accident.

544
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,509
An accident?

545
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,177
It was.

546
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:20,346
Stupid, really.

547
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:23,683
I was leaning over and I slipped.

548
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:29,689
I was leaning far over
to see the...

549
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:32,358
The...

550
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:35,528
- Propellers?
- Propellers, and I slipped.

551
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:38,531
And I would have gone
overboard but Mr. Dawson here...

552
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:42,035
saved me. And almost
went over himself.

553
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:44,037
You wanted to see the...
She wanted to see the propellers.

554
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:47,540
Like I said, women and
machinery do not mix.

555
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:50,376
Was that the way of it?

556
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,881
Yeah. Yeah, that
was pretty much it.

557
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:56,716
Well, the boy's a hero then.

558
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:58,635
Good for you, son. Well done.

559
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,887
So, it's all's well and back
to our brandy, eh?

560
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:06,893
Look at you. You must be freezing.
Let's get you inside.

561
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:09,896
Perhaps a little something
for the boy?

562
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,399
Of course.

563
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:17,236
Mr. Lovejoy,
I think a 20 should do it.

564
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:20,573
Is that the going rate
for saving the woman you love?

565
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:24,077
Rose is displeased.

566
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:26,245
What to do?

567
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:27,705
I know.

568
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:33,586
Perhaps you could join us for
dinner tomorrow evening...

569
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,421
to regale our group...

570
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:37,924
with your heroic tale.

571
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,428
Sure. Count me in.

572
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:45,098
Good. It's settled then.

573
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,433
This should be interesting.

574
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:59,445
Can I bum a smoke?

575
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:09,455
You'll want to tie those.

576
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,209
It's interesting...

577
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,545
the young lady slipped
so suddenly...

578
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:19,132
and you still had time to remove
your jacket and your shoes.

579
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:37,316
I know you've been melancholy.

580
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:40,319
I don't pretend to know why.

581
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,158
I intended to save this...

582
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:50,329
until the engagement
gala next week...

583
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:54,000
but, I thought...

584
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:55,668
tonight.

585
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:58,337
Good gracious.

586
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:02,008
Perhaps as a reminder
of my feelings for you.

587
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:04,135
- Is it a...
- Diamond. Yes.

588
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,849
56 carats to be exact.

589
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:14,187
It was worn by Louis XVI.

590
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:17,356
And they called
it Le Coeur de la Mer.

591
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,692
- The Heart of the Ocean.
- The Heart of the Ocean. Yes.

592
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,867
It's overwhelming.

593
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:29,994
Well, it's for royalty.

594
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:33,372
We are royalty, Rose.

595
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:39,712
You know, there's
nothing I couldn't give you.

596
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:42,548
There's nothing I'd deny you...

597
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:45,384
if you would not deny me.

598
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:51,891
Open your heart to me, Rose.

599
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:11,285
Well, I've been on my own since
I was 15, since my folks died.

600
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:16,415
And I had no brothers or sisters or
close kin in that part of the country...

601
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:20,211
so I lit on out of there and I
haven't been back since.

602
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,588
You could just call me a
tumbleweed blowing in the wind.

603
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:29,262
Well, Rose, we've walked about a mile
around this boat deck and...

604
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:32,557
chewed over how great the weather's
been and how I grew up...

605
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:36,435
but I reckon that's not why
you came to talk to me, is it?

606
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:40,439
- Mr. Dawson, I...
- Jack.

607
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:42,859
Jack.

608
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:46,529
I want to thank you
for what you did.

609
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:51,284
Not just for pulling me back,
but for your discretion.

610
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:52,952
You're welcome.

611
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:54,453
Look.

612
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:58,207
I know what you
must be thinking.

613
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:00,084
Poor little rich girl.

614
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:02,378
What does she know about misery?

615
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:03,629
No.

616
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:06,799
No, that's not what I was thinking.

617
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,384
What I was thinking was...

618
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:11,971
what could have happened to this girl
to make her think she had no way out?

619
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:15,641
Well I...

620
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:20,438
It was everything.
It was my whole world and...

621
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:21,731
all the people in it.

622
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:25,568
And the inertia of my life,
plunging ahead and me...

623
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:27,612
powerless to stop it.

624
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:29,822
God, look at that thing.

625
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:32,283
You would have gone
straight to the bottom.

626
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,495
500 invitations have gone out.

627
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:39,498
All of Philadelphia society will be there.

628
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:41,792
And all the while I feel I'm...

629
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:44,086
standing in the middle
of a crowded room...

630
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:45,838
screaming at the
top of my lungs...

631
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:47,173
and no one even looks up.

632
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,009
Do you love him?

633
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:52,345
Pardon me?

634
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:54,138
Do you love him?

635
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:57,683
You're being very rude. You
shouldn't be asking me this.

636
00:48:58,143 --> 00:49:00,686
Well, it's a simple question.
Do you love the guy or not?

637
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:05,191
This is not a suitable conversation.

638
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:06,692
Why can't you just
answer the question?

639
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,322
This is absurd.

640
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,032
You don't know me
and I don't know you...

641
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:16,327
and we are not having this
conversation at all. You are rude...

642
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:19,872
and uncouth and presumptuous
and I am leaving now...

643
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:23,042
Jack. Mr. Dawson.
It's been a pleasure.

644
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,961
I sought you out to thank you
and now I have thanked you.

645
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:27,171
And you've insulted me.

646
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:29,006
Well, you deserved it.

647
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:30,383
- Right.
- Right.

648
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,012
I thought you were leaving.

649
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:36,555
I am.

650
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:40,059
You are so annoying.

651
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:42,561
Wait.

652
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:47,066
I don't have to leave. This is
my part of the ship. You leave.

653
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:50,403
Well, well, well.
Now who's being rude?

654
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:57,076
What is this stupid thing
you're carrying around?

655
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:00,579
So, what are you,
an artist or something?

656
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:06,585
These are rather good.

657
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:13,092
They're very good, actually.

658
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:22,101
Jack, this is exquisite work.

659
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:25,104
They didn't think too
much of them in old Paree.

660
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,605
Paris?

661
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:30,568
You do get around for a p...

662
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:36,073
Well, a... a
person of limited means.

663
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:38,284
Go on. A poor guy. You can say it.

664
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:43,289
Well, well, well.

665
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:49,253
And these were drawn from life?

666
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,800
Well, that's one of the
good things about Paris.

667
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:56,719
Lots of girls are willing
to take their clothes off.

668
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:04,643
You liked this woman.

669
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,646
You used her several times.

670
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:09,815
Well.

671
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:12,485
She had beautiful
hands, you see?

672
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:17,323
I think you must have
had a love affair with her.

673
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:19,825
No, no, no.
Just with her hands.

674
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,828
She was a
one-legged prostitute.

675
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:24,955
See?

676
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:33,506
She had a good
sense of humor though.

677
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,009
Oh, and this lady...

678
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:41,847
She used to sit at this bar every night...

679
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:43,682
wearing every piece
of jewelry she owned...

680
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,268
just waiting for
her long, lost love.

681
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:49,355
We called her Madame Bijoux.

682
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:51,690
See, her clothes are all moth-eaten.

683
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,195
Well, you have a gift, Jack.

684
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:57,863
You do.

685
00:51:58,198 --> 00:51:59,698
You see people.

686
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:01,534
I see you.

687
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,287
And?

688
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:08,374
You wouldn't have jumped.

689
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:16,340
But the purpose of university
is to find a suitable husband.

690
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,217
Rose has already done that.

691
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:21,387
Look, here comes that
vulgar Brown woman.

692
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:24,390
Quickly, get up before
she sits with us.

693
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:28,018
Hello, girls. I was hoping
I'd catch you at tea.

694
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:29,728
We're awfully sorry,
you missed it.

695
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:33,315
The Countess and I were just
off to take the air on the boat deck.

696
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:36,569
What a lovely idea.
I need to catch up on my gossip.

697
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:41,240
Countess.

698
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:45,578
So, you've not yet lit the
last four boilers?

699
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:47,538
No, I don't see the need.

700
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:49,415
We are making excellent time.

701
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:55,254
The press knows the size of Titanic.
Now, I want them to marvel at her speed.

702
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:57,756
We must give them
something new to print.

703
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:01,760
This maiden voyage
of Titanic must...

704
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:03,846
make headlines.

705
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:08,100
Mr. Ismay, I would prefer
not to push the engines...

706
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,936
until they've been properly run in.

707
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:13,564
Of course I'm just a passenger.

708
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:16,025
I leave it to your good offices
to decide what's best.

709
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:19,278
But what a glorious end
to your final crossing...

710
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,030
if we were to get into New York
on Tuesday night...

711
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:23,782
and surprise them all.
Make the morning papers.

712
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:26,577
Retire with a bang, eh, E. J?

713
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:31,624
Good man.

714
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,544
After that, I worked
on a squid boat in Monterey...

715
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:38,464
then I went to Los Angeles to the...

716
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:41,884
Santa Monica pier
and did portraits for 10 cents each.

717
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:44,470
Why can't I be like you?

718
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:48,307
Just head out for the horizon
whenever I feel like it.

719
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:53,062
Say we'll go there
sometime, to that pier...

720
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:55,481
only if we just talk about it.

721
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:58,651
No, we'll do it. We'll drink cheap beer.

722
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:01,654
Ride on the roller coaster
till we throw up.

723
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:05,157
We'll ride horses on the
beach, in the surf.

724
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:09,495
But you have to do it like a real cowboy.
No sidesaddle stuff.

725
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:12,665
You mean with one leg on each side?

726
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Can you show me?

727
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:17,086
Sure, if you like.

728
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:20,339
Teach me to ride like a man.

729
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:21,924
Chew tobacco like a man.

730
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,678
And spit like a man.

731
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:27,763
You didn't learn in finishing school?

732
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:29,181
No.

733
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:31,350
Come on, I'll show you.

734
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:33,352
I'll show you how.

735
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:36,522
Jack! No, Jack, no. Wait.

736
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:39,858
I couldn't possibly, Jack.

737
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:41,860
Watch closely.

738
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,364
That's disgusting.

739
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:46,532
Your turn.

740
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:51,870
That was pitiful.
You really have to hawk it back.

741
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:55,207
Get some leverage.
Use your arms. Arc your neck.

742
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,544
You see the range on that thing?

743
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:00,546
Okay, go.

744
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:09,054
That was better. You have to work on it.
Really try to hawk it up.

745
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,314
Mother.

746
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:26,071
May I introduce Jack Dawson?

747
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,074
Charmed, I'm sure.

748
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:38,417
The others were gracious and curious
about the man who'd saved my life.

749
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:42,588
But my mother looked at him like an insect.

750
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:47,092
A dangerous insect
which must be squashed quickly.

751
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:51,263
Sounds like you're a good man
to have around in a sticky spot.

752
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:58,937
Why do they always insist on announcing
dinner like a damn cavalry charge?

753
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:00,939
Shall we go dress, Mother?

754
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:03,776
See you at dinner, Jack.

755
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:06,779
Son?

756
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,447
Son!

757
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:11,283
Do you have any idea what you're doing?

758
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:13,285
Not really.

759
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:16,121
You're about to go into the snake pit.

760
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,209
What are you going to wear?

761
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:25,297
I figured. Come on.

762
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:32,304
I was right. You and my son
are just about the same size.

763
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,306
Pretty close.

764
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:40,312
You shine up like a new penny.

765
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:53,826
Good evening, sir.

766
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:00,893
Thousands of tons of Hockley steel
are in this ship.

767
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:03,228
- Which part?
- All the right ones.

768
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,648
Then you're accountable
if there's a problem. Where's Rose?

769
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,233
She'll be along.

770
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:10,569
There is the Countess.

771
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:42,935
I saw that in a nickelodeon
and always wanted to do it.

772
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,534
Darling...

773
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:01,286
surely you remember Mr. Dawson.

774
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:07,709
It's amazing.
You could almost pass for a gentleman.

775
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:10,128
Almost.

776
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:11,880
This is extraordinary.

777
00:59:26,479 --> 00:59:28,146
This is a remarkable voyage.

778
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:29,815
- Mad.
- Completely lunatic.

779
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,569
There's the Countess of Rothes.

780
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:38,657
That's John Jacob Astor...

781
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:40,993
the richest man on board.

782
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:45,163
His little wifey, Madeleine,
is my age and in a delicate condition.

783
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:48,000
See how she tries to hide it.

784
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:49,668
Quite the scandal.

785
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:54,673
Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress,
Madame Aubert. Mrs. Guggenheim...

786
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:58,594
is at home with the children, of course.
And over here...

787
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:00,512
Sir Cosmo and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon.

788
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:04,099
She designs naughty lingerie,
among her many talents.

789
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:06,685
Very popular with the royals.

790
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:09,521
Congratulations. She's splendid.

791
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:11,356
Why, thank you.

792
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:13,609
Escort a lady to dinner?

793
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:15,360
Certainly.

794
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:18,697
Sweet pea, sweet pea.

795
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:20,949
Ain't nothing to it.

796
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:26,204
They love money. Pretend like you own
a gold mine and you're in the club.

797
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:30,042
Hey, Astor.

798
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:33,545
Hello, Molly. Nice to see you.

799
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:36,715
J.J., Madeleine,
I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson.

800
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:39,468
Well, Jack...

801
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:41,553
are you of the Boston Dawsons?

802
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:45,140
No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually.

803
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:46,725
Oh, yes.

804
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:52,731
He must have been nervous.
But he never faltered.

805
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:55,734
They assumed he was one of them.

806
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:59,237
Heir to a rail road fortune, perhaps.

807
01:00:59,572 --> 01:01:03,742
New money, obviously,
but still a member of the club.

808
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:07,829
Mother. Of course.
Could always be counted upon.

809
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:13,335
Tell us of the accommodations in steerage,
Mr. Dawson. I hear they're quite good.

810
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:18,006
The best I've seen, ma'am. Hardly any rats.

811
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:23,929
Mr. Dawson is joining us from third class.

812
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:26,515
He was of help to my fiancée last night.

813
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:29,601
It happens Mr. Dawson
is quite a fine artist.

814
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,437
He showed me some of his work today.

815
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:37,776
Rose and I differ in our definition of fine art.
Not to impugn your work, sir.

816
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:49,621
Are all these mine?

817
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:51,957
Start from the outside and work in.

818
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:54,209
He knows every rivet in her.

819
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:56,795
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews.

820
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:58,380
Thank you, Rose.

821
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:03,135
How do you take your caviar, sir?

822
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:06,638
No caviar for me, thanks.
Never did like it much.

823
01:02:08,474 --> 01:02:11,143
Where exactly do you live, Mr. Dawson?

824
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:14,563
Right now, my address is the RMS Titanic.

825
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:16,815
After that, I'm on God's good humor.

826
01:02:17,316 --> 01:02:19,234
How do you have means to travel?

827
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:24,322
I work my way from place to place.
Tramp steamers and such.

828
01:02:24,657 --> 01:02:28,326
I won my ticket on Titanic
at a lucky hand at poker.

829
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,078
A very lucky hand.

830
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:32,998
All life is a game of luck.

831
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:37,085
A real man makes his own luck.
Right, Dawson?

832
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:42,591
And you find
that sort of rootless existence appealing?

833
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:47,262
Yes, ma'am, I do.

834
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:51,016
I've got everything I need
right here with me.

835
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:54,102
I have air in my lungs
and blank sheets of paper.

836
01:02:55,521 --> 01:02:59,941
I love waking up, not knowing
what will happen or who I'll meet.

837
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,277
Where I'll wind up.

838
01:03:02,695 --> 01:03:04,946
One night I'm sleeping under a bridge...

839
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:09,451
now I'm on the grandest ship
in the world, with you fine people.

840
01:03:09,702 --> 01:03:10,702
I'll take more of that.

841
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:15,040
Life's a gift. I don't
intend on wasting it.

842
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:18,877
You never know what hand you'll get dealt.

843
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:21,880
You take life as it comes at you.
Here, Cal.

844
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,134
Make each day count.

845
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:27,969
Well said, Jack.

846
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:29,304
Hear, hear.

847
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:35,227
To making it count.

848
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:36,728
Bravo.

849
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:47,405
But Mr. Brown didn't know
I'd hidden the money in the stove.

850
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:52,744
He comes home drunk as a pig celebrating
and lights a fire.

851
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:58,416
Next is brandy in the smoking room.

852
01:04:00,586 --> 01:04:02,671
Join me in a brandy, gentlemen?

853
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:09,010
Now they retreat to congratulate each
other on being masters of the universe.

854
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:11,263
Ladies, thank you for your company.

855
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:14,015
May I escort you to the cabin?

856
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:15,267
No, I'll stay here.

857
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:17,102
Here, Molly.

858
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:20,105
Joining us, Dawson?

859
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:22,774
You don't want to stay with the women.

860
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:25,610
No, thanks. I have to head back.

861
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:30,615
That's best. It'll be all business and politics.
Wouldn't interest you.

862
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:34,369
But Dawson, good of you to come.

863
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:41,293
Must you go?

864
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:43,879
Time for me to row with the other slaves.

865
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:48,800
Good night, Rose.

866
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:31,343
Want to go to a real party?

867
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:43,939
Is okay I put my hand here?

868
01:06:03,542 --> 01:06:05,543
I can't understand you.

869
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:40,161
I'm going to dance with her now.

870
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:41,329
Come on.

871
01:06:41,914 --> 01:06:43,915
Come on. Come with me.

872
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:46,084
Jack. Jack, wait.

873
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:49,421
I can't do this.

874
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:51,506
We'll have to get a bit closer.

875
01:06:51,757 --> 01:06:52,924
Like this.

876
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:57,929
You're still my best girl, Cora.

877
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:04,352
- I don't know the steps.
- Me, either. Just go with it.

878
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:06,187
Don't think.

879
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:27,959
Wait! Jack! Wait! Stop, Jack!

880
01:07:37,803 --> 01:07:39,304
What? Wait!

881
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:22,180
Jack, no.

882
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:31,689
Beyond the jurisdiction
of the Sherman Act.

883
01:08:32,024 --> 01:08:35,777
That's what Rockefeller said...
Supreme Court didn't swallow it.

884
01:08:56,048 --> 01:08:59,717
What? You think
a first-class girl can't drink?

885
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:02,971
Get out of here.

886
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:04,889
Are you all right?

887
01:09:06,892 --> 01:09:07,892
I'm fine.

888
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:10,145
Two out of three.

889
01:09:11,063 --> 01:09:12,397
So...

890
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:15,567
you think you're tough?

891
01:09:16,902 --> 01:09:18,403
Let's see you do this.

892
01:09:20,739 --> 01:09:23,408
Hold this for me, Jack. Hold it up.

893
01:09:41,093 --> 01:09:42,177
Jesus!

894
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:43,595
You okay?

895
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:45,430
I haven't done that in years.

896
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:56,274
Come on, lads. Give it all you got.
Let's go.

897
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:23,635
Coffee, sir?

898
01:10:33,562 --> 01:10:35,230
You didn't come to me last night.

899
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:38,983
I was tired.

900
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:44,155
Your exertions below deck
were no doubt exhausting.

901
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:50,828
I see you had
that undertaker of a manservant follow me.

902
01:10:51,163 --> 01:10:54,082
You will never behave like that again.

903
01:10:57,670 --> 01:11:00,672
I'm not one of your mill foremen
who you can command.

904
01:11:02,174 --> 01:11:03,841
I'm your fiancée.

905
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:07,512
My fiancée. My fiancée!

906
01:11:07,846 --> 01:11:09,847
Yes, you are! And my wife!

907
01:11:11,183 --> 01:11:15,687
My wife in practice,
if not yet by law, so you will honor me!

908
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:18,773
You will honor me the way
a wife honors her husband.

909
01:11:19,024 --> 01:11:21,276
Because I will not be made a fool of.

910
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:23,945
Is this in any way unclear?

911
01:11:24,863 --> 01:11:26,030
No.

912
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:28,700
Good. Excuse me.

913
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:36,040
Oh, Miss Rose.

914
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:39,294
We had a little accident.

915
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:41,713
- That's all right.
- I'm sorry.

916
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:43,131
Let me help you.

917
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:45,982
It's all right, miss.

918
01:11:58,564 --> 01:11:59,897
Tea, Trudy.

919
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:20,585
You're not to see that boy again.
You understand?

920
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,255
Rose, I forbid it.

921
01:12:25,257 --> 01:12:28,259
Stop it, Mother.
You'll give yourself a nosebleed.

922
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:30,261
This is not a game.

923
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:34,432
Our situation is precarious.
You know the money's gone.

924
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:39,103
Of course I know.
You remind me every day.

925
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:45,026
Your father left us nothing but a legacy
of bad debts hidden by a good name.

926
01:12:45,277 --> 01:12:47,945
That name is the only card we have to play.

927
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:50,281
I don't understand you.

928
01:12:50,949 --> 01:12:54,952
It is a fine match with Hockley.
It will ensure our survival.

929
01:12:56,288 --> 01:12:57,955
How can you put this on me?

930
01:12:58,207 --> 01:12:59,707
Why are you being so selfish?

931
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:02,043
I'm being selfish?

932
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:08,466
Do you want to see me
working as a seamstress?

933
01:13:10,302 --> 01:13:12,136
Is that what you want?

934
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:17,642
To see our fine things sold at auction?

935
01:13:19,311 --> 01:13:21,145
Our memories scattered?

936
01:13:32,324 --> 01:13:33,991
It's so unfair.

937
01:13:35,327 --> 01:13:37,161
Of course it's unfair.

938
01:13:38,497 --> 01:13:39,831
We're women.

939
01:13:42,334 --> 01:13:44,502
Our choices are never easy.

940
01:14:06,358 --> 01:14:10,194
Protect them by Thy guiding hand

941
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:15,366
From every peril on the land

942
01:14:17,369 --> 01:14:21,372
O, spirit whom the Father sent

943
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:26,210
To spread abroad the firmament

944
01:14:26,545 --> 01:14:30,882
O, wind of heaven, by Thy might

945
01:14:31,216 --> 01:14:36,053
Save all who dare the eagle's flight

946
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:40,224
And keep them by Thy watchful care...

947
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:44,562
Hello, Mr. Andrews.

948
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:56,240
I need to talk to someone.

949
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:58,743
You're not supposed to be in here.

950
01:15:03,415 --> 01:15:04,999
I was here last night, remember?

951
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:06,918
No. Now please turn around.

952
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:10,004
He'll tell you. I just need to talk...

953
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:13,424
Mr. Hockley and Mrs. DeWitt Bukater...

954
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:16,594
are still appreciative
of your assistance.

955
01:15:16,929 --> 01:15:20,431
They asked me
to give you this in gratitude...

956
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:22,266
I don't want your money.

957
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:26,437
And remind you you are
in third class and your presence here...

958
01:15:26,688 --> 01:15:28,439
is no longer appropriate.

959
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:30,024
Let me speak to Rose.

960
01:15:30,275 --> 01:15:34,278
Gentlemen, please see Mr. Dawson
returns to where he belongs...

961
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:36,280
and that he stays there?

962
01:15:37,115 --> 01:15:38,115
Yes, sir.

963
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:39,534
Come along, you.

964
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:44,789
Hear us when we cry to Thee

965
01:15:45,123 --> 01:15:49,627
For those in peril on the sea

966
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:52,463
Why are there two steering wheels?

967
01:15:52,714 --> 01:15:54,215
We use this one near shore.

968
01:15:54,466 --> 01:15:58,135
Excuse me, sir.
Another ice warning, from the Noordam.

969
01:15:58,387 --> 01:15:59,720
Thank you, Sparks.

970
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:05,309
Not to worry.
Quite normal for this time of year.

971
01:16:06,311 --> 01:16:10,314
In fact, we're speeding up.
I've ordered the last boilers lit.

972
01:16:14,361 --> 01:16:17,321
Okay, son, wind it up tight
like I showed you. That's right.

973
01:16:17,531 --> 01:16:19,156
Okay, now let it go.

974
01:16:22,202 --> 01:16:24,203
- It was good, wasn't it?
- Quite nice. That's excellent.

975
01:16:31,211 --> 01:16:34,213
Mr. Andrews... Forgive me.

976
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,257
I did the sum in my head...

977
01:16:36,883 --> 01:16:40,386
and with the number of lifeboats
times the capacity you mentioned...

978
01:16:40,721 --> 01:16:44,223
Forgive me, but it seems that there are
not enough for everyone aboard.

979
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:46,726
About half, actually.

980
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:49,061
Rose, you miss nothing, do you?

981
01:16:49,896 --> 01:16:52,064
In fact, I put in these new
type davits...

982
01:16:52,399 --> 01:16:55,026
which can take an extra row
of boats inside this one.

983
01:16:55,736 --> 01:16:57,695
But it was thought, by some...

984
01:16:57,863 --> 01:16:59,447
the deck would look
too cluttered.

985
01:16:59,906 --> 01:17:02,241
So, I was overruled.

986
01:17:02,743 --> 01:17:05,745
It's a waste of deck space
as it is on an unsinkable ship.

987
01:17:06,079 --> 01:17:07,747
Sleep soundly, young Rose.

988
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:10,458
I have built you a good ship,
strong and true.

989
01:17:10,751 --> 01:17:12,418
She's all the lifeboat
you need.

990
01:17:12,753 --> 01:17:15,755
Just keep heading aft. The next
stop will be the engine room.

991
01:17:21,094 --> 01:17:25,431
Jack, this is impossible.
I can't see you.

992
01:17:25,724 --> 01:17:28,601
- I need to talk to you.
- No, Jack. No.

993
01:17:30,103 --> 01:17:32,438
Jack. I'm engaged.

994
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,274
I'm marrying Cal.

995
01:17:36,109 --> 01:17:37,234
I love Cal.

996
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:41,113
Rose...

997
01:17:41,615 --> 01:17:46,118
you're no picnic. All right?
You're a spoiled little brat even.

998
01:17:46,453 --> 01:17:50,956
But under that, you're the
most amazingly, astounding...

999
01:17:51,291 --> 01:17:52,958
wonderful girl...

1000
01:17:53,585 --> 01:17:55,419
woman, that I've ever known.

1001
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:56,587
Jack, I...

1002
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:59,340
No, let me try and get
this out. You're ama...

1003
01:18:01,802 --> 01:18:04,804
I'm not an idiot.
I know how the world works.

1004
01:18:05,138 --> 01:18:07,014
I've got ten bucks
in my pocket.

1005
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:09,934
I have nothing to offer
you and I know that.

1006
01:18:10,143 --> 01:18:11,811
I understand.

1007
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:14,438
But I'm too involved now.

1008
01:18:14,815 --> 01:18:16,816
You jump, I jump. Remember?

1009
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:19,652
I can't turn away without
knowing you'll be all right.

1010
01:18:21,446 --> 01:18:22,446
That's all that I want.

1011
01:18:23,824 --> 01:18:25,324
Well, I'm fine.

1012
01:18:26,493 --> 01:18:28,994
I'll be fine. Really.

1013
01:18:29,996 --> 01:18:31,163
Really?

1014
01:18:33,333 --> 01:18:34,834
I don't think so.

1015
01:18:35,836 --> 01:18:37,962
They've got you trapped, Rose.

1016
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:39,505
And you're gonna die if you
don't break free.

1017
01:18:39,631 --> 01:18:40,673
Maybe not right away...

1018
01:18:40,799 --> 01:18:42,466
because you're strong...

1019
01:18:43,844 --> 01:18:47,179
but sooner or later that
fire that I love about you, Rose...

1020
01:18:47,514 --> 01:18:50,015
that fire is gonna burn out.

1021
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:56,647
It's not up to you
to save me, Jack.

1022
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:00,359
You're right.

1023
01:19:01,695 --> 01:19:03,362
Only you can do that.

1024
01:19:09,369 --> 01:19:10,870
I'm going back.

1025
01:19:11,204 --> 01:19:12,705
Leave me alone.

1026
01:19:24,217 --> 01:19:27,386
Tell Lucile about the disaster
you had with the stationers.

1027
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:30,347
Well, of course the invitations
had to be sent back, twice.

1028
01:19:30,557 --> 01:19:31,724
Oh, my dear.

1029
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:33,559
And the dreadful
bridesmaids' gowns.

1030
01:19:33,685 --> 01:19:36,020
Let me tell you what an
odyssey that has been.

1031
01:19:36,229 --> 01:19:38,522
Rose decided she
wanted lavender.

1032
01:19:39,274 --> 01:19:40,441
She knows I detest the color.

1033
01:19:40,901 --> 01:19:42,193
So, she did it only to spite me.

1034
01:19:42,402 --> 01:19:44,403
If only you'd come to
me sooner.

1035
01:19:44,696 --> 01:19:47,531
Ruth saw some of my designs in
La Mode Illustrée.

1036
01:19:47,741 --> 01:19:51,076
They were for the trousseau of the Duchess
of Marlborough's youngest daughter.

1037
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:52,203
They were quite charming.

1038
01:19:52,287 --> 01:19:54,288
But, I think you'll agree,
my dear, that together...

1039
01:19:54,581 --> 01:19:57,750
we've created something
of a phoenix from the ashes.

1040
01:20:12,557 --> 01:20:13,557
Hello, Jack.

1041
01:20:19,272 --> 01:20:21,106
I changed my mind.

1042
01:20:27,072 --> 01:20:28,280
They said you might be up here.

1043
01:20:31,284 --> 01:20:32,618
Give me your hand.

1044
01:20:40,126 --> 01:20:41,460
Now close your eyes.

1045
01:20:42,796 --> 01:20:44,129
Go on.

1046
01:20:47,467 --> 01:20:48,968
Now, step up.

1047
01:20:52,806 --> 01:20:54,098
Now, hold onto the railing.

1048
01:20:54,182 --> 01:20:56,183
Keep your eyes closed.
Don't peek.

1049
01:20:56,434 --> 01:20:57,434
I'm not.

1050
01:20:58,812 --> 01:21:00,813
Now, step up onto the rail.

1051
01:21:04,818 --> 01:21:06,819
Hold on. Hold on.

1052
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:09,154
Keep your eyes closed.

1053
01:21:09,656 --> 01:21:10,990
Do you trust me?

1054
01:21:11,491 --> 01:21:12,825
I trust you.

1055
01:21:22,669 --> 01:21:23,669
All right...

1056
01:21:24,045 --> 01:21:25,546
open your eyes.

1057
01:21:32,637 --> 01:21:33,637
I'm flying.

1058
01:21:34,139 --> 01:21:35,139
Jack.

1059
01:22:00,248 --> 01:22:04,376
Come, Josephine, in my
flying machine. Going up...

1060
01:22:05,211 --> 01:22:08,547
she goes. Up she goes.

1061
01:22:56,262 --> 01:22:59,264
That was the last time
Titanic ever saw daylight.

1062
01:23:00,725 --> 01:23:02,810
We're up to dusk the
night of the sinking.

1063
01:23:03,645 --> 01:23:04,895
6 hours to go.

1064
01:23:05,105 --> 01:23:08,065
Incredible. There's Smith and
he's standing there and...

1065
01:23:08,149 --> 01:23:09,817
he's got the iceberg warning
in his fucking hand...

1066
01:23:10,068 --> 01:23:13,070
excuse me... his hand,
and he's ordering more speed.

1067
01:23:13,279 --> 01:23:16,448
26 years of experience
working against him.

1068
01:23:16,741 --> 01:23:18,742
He figures anything big
enough to sink, the ship...

1069
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:20,661
they're gonna see in time to turn.

1070
01:23:20,954 --> 01:23:23,414
But the ship's too big
with too small a rudder.

1071
01:23:23,581 --> 01:23:25,624
Doesn't corner worth a damn.

1072
01:23:26,793 --> 01:23:29,128
Everything he knows is wrong.

1073
01:23:41,808 --> 01:23:45,644
It's quite proper, I assure you.
This is the sitting room.

1074
01:23:47,647 --> 01:23:49,148
- Will this light do?
- What?

1075
01:23:50,483 --> 01:23:51,817
Don't artists need good light?

1076
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:54,319
That is true, but I'm not
used to working in...

1077
01:23:55,113 --> 01:23:56,697
such horrible conditions.

1078
01:23:57,490 --> 01:23:58,824
Monet!

1079
01:23:59,659 --> 01:24:02,327
- Do you know his work?
- Of course.

1080
01:24:02,829 --> 01:24:04,663
Look at his use of color here.
Isn't he great?

1081
01:24:04,956 --> 01:24:06,957
I know. It's extraordinary.

1082
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:12,796
Cal insists on carting
this hideous thing everywhere.

1083
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:16,133
Should we be expecting him
any time soon?

1084
01:24:16,634 --> 01:24:19,970
Not as long as the cigars
and brandy hold out.

1085
01:24:23,349 --> 01:24:24,349
That's nice.

1086
01:24:24,559 --> 01:24:26,393
What is it, a sapphire?

1087
01:24:27,187 --> 01:24:28,312
A diamond.

1088
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:30,397
A very rare diamond.

1089
01:24:34,194 --> 01:24:36,820
Jack, I want you to draw me
like one of your French girls.

1090
01:24:38,198 --> 01:24:39,531
Wearing this.

1091
01:24:39,866 --> 01:24:41,033
All right.

1092
01:24:42,869 --> 01:24:44,870
Wearing only this.

1093
01:25:20,281 --> 01:25:24,076
The last thing I need is another picture
of me looking like a porcelain doll.

1094
01:25:28,039 --> 01:25:29,039
As a paying customer...

1095
01:25:32,043 --> 01:25:33,919
I expect to get what I want.

1096
01:25:51,771 --> 01:25:54,565
Over on the bed... the couch.

1097
01:26:03,741 --> 01:26:04,741
Come. Lie down.

1098
01:26:08,246 --> 01:26:09,746
- Tell me when it looks right.
- Keep that.

1099
01:26:09,956 --> 01:26:11,790
Put your arm back
the way it was.

1100
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:17,629
Put that other arm up,
that hand right by your face there.

1101
01:26:19,132 --> 01:26:20,132
Right.

1102
01:26:21,134 --> 01:26:23,302
Now, head down.

1103
01:26:25,930 --> 01:26:27,806
Eyes to me. Keep them on me.

1104
01:26:29,809 --> 01:26:31,977
And try to stay still.

1105
01:26:50,496 --> 01:26:52,497
So serious.

1106
01:27:33,873 --> 01:27:36,875
I believe you are blushing,
Mr. Big Artiste.

1107
01:27:41,381 --> 01:27:44,216
I can't imagine
Monsieur Monet blushing.

1108
01:27:45,551 --> 01:27:47,219
He does landscapes.

1109
01:27:47,887 --> 01:27:50,055
- Just relax your face.
- Sorry.

1110
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:51,723
No laughing.

1111
01:28:22,755 --> 01:28:25,757
My heart was pounding
the whole time.

1112
01:28:26,092 --> 01:28:30,095
It was the most erotic
moment of my life...

1113
01:28:33,766 --> 01:28:36,101
up until then, at least.

1114
01:28:36,602 --> 01:28:38,395
So what happened next?

1115
01:28:39,272 --> 01:28:41,940
You mean, did we do it?

1116
01:28:44,444 --> 01:28:46,778
Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Bodine.

1117
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,781
Jack was very professional.

1118
01:28:57,790 --> 01:28:58,957
Thank you.

1119
01:29:07,091 --> 01:29:08,425
What are you doing?

1120
01:29:09,302 --> 01:29:11,595
Will you put this
back in the safe for me?

1121
01:29:23,649 --> 01:29:25,484
Gentlemen, would you excuse me.

1122
01:29:27,820 --> 01:29:29,821
None of the stewards
have seen her.

1123
01:29:30,823 --> 01:29:33,617
This is absurd. It's a ship.

1124
01:29:33,701 --> 01:29:35,869
There's only so many
places she could be.

1125
01:29:36,162 --> 01:29:37,829
Lovejoy, find her.

1126
01:29:55,139 --> 01:29:56,473
- Clear.
- Yes.

1127
01:29:58,184 --> 01:30:01,686
I don't think I've ever
seen such a flat calm.

1128
01:30:02,188 --> 01:30:03,188
Like a mill pond.

1129
01:30:04,357 --> 01:30:05,899
Not a breath of wind.

1130
01:30:07,026 --> 01:30:10,028
It will make the bergs
harder to see...

1131
01:30:10,363 --> 01:30:12,322
with no breaking
water at the base.

1132
01:30:23,835 --> 01:30:24,835
Well, I'm off.

1133
01:30:24,919 --> 01:30:28,088
Maintain speed and
heading, Mr. Lightoller.

1134
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:30,090
Yes, sir.

1135
01:30:41,394 --> 01:30:43,728
It's getting cold.
You look nice.

1136
01:30:44,063 --> 01:30:45,397
Miss Rose?

1137
01:30:45,898 --> 01:30:47,566
My drawings!

1138
01:31:13,593 --> 01:31:14,885
Come on!

1139
01:31:17,930 --> 01:31:20,932
Wait, wait, wait!

1140
01:31:21,893 --> 01:31:23,435
- Go. Go. Down, down.
- Take us down, quickly. Quickly!

1141
01:31:31,068 --> 01:31:32,068
Bye.

1142
01:31:39,952 --> 01:31:41,286
Sorry.

1143
01:31:46,626 --> 01:31:48,293
- Keep going.
- Thank you, I've got it.

1144
01:31:58,596 --> 01:32:00,430
Pretty tough for
a valet, this fella.

1145
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:02,265
Seems more like a cop.

1146
01:32:02,475 --> 01:32:03,600
I think he was.

1147
01:32:04,310 --> 01:32:05,936
- Oh, shit.
- Go!

1148
01:32:10,816 --> 01:32:12,317
No, over here!

1149
01:32:12,652 --> 01:32:13,818
Quick!

1150
01:32:20,326 --> 01:32:21,993
Now what?

1151
01:32:22,286 --> 01:32:23,620
What?

1152
01:32:28,834 --> 01:32:30,502
More coal for number one, mate.

1153
01:32:30,795 --> 01:32:33,296
Hold up? What are you two
doing down here?

1154
01:32:33,839 --> 01:32:34,839
You shouldn't be down here.

1155
01:32:35,174 --> 01:32:36,216
It could be dangerous!

1156
01:32:40,638 --> 01:32:41,638
Carry on!

1157
01:32:42,014 --> 01:32:43,890
Don't mind us. You're
doing a great job!

1158
01:32:44,058 --> 01:32:45,559
Keep up the good work!

1159
01:33:01,867 --> 01:33:03,868
Look at what we have here?

1160
01:33:22,054 --> 01:33:23,388
Thank you.

1161
01:33:35,067 --> 01:33:36,901
Where to, miss?

1162
01:33:38,070 --> 01:33:39,738
To the stars.

1163
01:33:58,758 --> 01:34:00,258
You nervous?

1164
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:03,887
No.

1165
01:34:20,780 --> 01:34:22,781
Put your hands on me, Jack.

1166
01:34:46,806 --> 01:34:48,306
It's bloody cold.

1167
01:34:48,808 --> 01:34:52,310
You know, I can smell ice, you know.
When it's near.

1168
01:34:53,646 --> 01:34:54,979
Bollocks!

1169
01:34:55,314 --> 01:34:56,981
Well, I can, all right?

1170
01:34:57,316 --> 01:34:59,442
Did you ever find those
binoculars for the lookouts?

1171
01:34:59,652 --> 01:35:01,486
Haven't seen them
since Southampton.

1172
01:35:02,154 --> 01:35:03,488
Well, I'll be on my rounds.

1173
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:05,448
Cheerio.

1174
01:35:36,689 --> 01:35:38,022
You're trembling.

1175
01:35:40,484 --> 01:35:41,526
Don't worry.

1176
01:35:41,652 --> 01:35:43,403
I'll be all right.

1177
01:36:04,717 --> 01:36:06,551
- They ran down there.
- Right.

1178
01:36:16,312 --> 01:36:17,979
Anything missing?

1179
01:36:43,005 --> 01:36:44,839
I have a better idea.

1180
01:36:57,686 --> 01:36:58,853
Got you!

1181
01:37:08,113 --> 01:37:10,949
Did you see those guys' faces?

1182
01:37:11,534 --> 01:37:13,368
Did you see them?

1183
01:37:19,708 --> 01:37:21,543
When the ship docks...

1184
01:37:22,878 --> 01:37:24,629
I'm getting off with you.

1185
01:37:25,714 --> 01:37:27,048
This is crazy.

1186
01:37:27,216 --> 01:37:30,051
I know. It doesn't make any sense.

1187
01:37:31,554 --> 01:37:33,054
That's why I trust it.

1188
01:37:42,064 --> 01:37:44,732
Here, look at this.

1189
01:37:45,568 --> 01:37:47,569
Look at that, would you?

1190
01:37:47,903 --> 01:37:49,404
They're warmer than we are.

1191
01:37:49,822 --> 01:37:54,158
If that's what it takes for us to get warm,
I'd rather not.

1192
01:38:06,422 --> 01:38:07,922
Bugger me!

1193
01:38:13,262 --> 01:38:14,762
Pick up, you bastards!

1194
01:38:18,434 --> 01:38:19,434
Is anyone there?!

1195
01:38:19,685 --> 01:38:20,852
What do you see?

1196
01:38:21,103 --> 01:38:22,520
Iceberg, right ahead!

1197
01:38:22,771 --> 01:38:23,855
Thank you.

1198
01:38:26,191 --> 01:38:27,191
Iceberg ahead!

1199
01:38:27,359 --> 01:38:29,360
Hard a' starboard!

1200
01:38:36,285 --> 01:38:38,536
Turn! Turn! Smartly!

1201
01:38:43,792 --> 01:38:44,792
Full astern!

1202
01:38:47,129 --> 01:38:48,129
Hard over.

1203
01:38:48,297 --> 01:38:49,964
Helm's hard over, sir.

1204
01:38:53,636 --> 01:38:55,136
Go, lads, go!

1205
01:38:57,556 --> 01:39:00,308
Bring that steam down! Bring it down!

1206
01:39:02,144 --> 01:39:04,979
Shut all the dampers! Shut them!

1207
01:39:09,818 --> 01:39:10,818
Hold it.

1208
01:39:12,655 --> 01:39:13,655
Hold it!

1209
01:39:15,074 --> 01:39:16,824
Now! Engage reversing engine!

1210
01:39:45,854 --> 01:39:47,355
Why ain't they turning?

1211
01:39:47,606 --> 01:39:48,773
Is it hard over?!

1212
01:39:49,024 --> 01:39:51,025
It is, sir. Hard over.

1213
01:39:55,030 --> 01:39:59,200
Come on, come on, come on. Turn.

1214
01:40:10,379 --> 01:40:11,713
Yes.

1215
01:40:16,885 --> 01:40:18,553
It's going to hit!

1216
01:40:29,982 --> 01:40:31,482
Jesus Christ!

1217
01:40:52,254 --> 01:40:53,421
Jesus!

1218
01:40:53,672 --> 01:40:56,257
Hard to port!

1219
01:41:06,101 --> 01:41:07,602
Get back!

1220
01:41:37,049 --> 01:41:38,382
Let's go!

1221
01:41:38,634 --> 01:41:41,969
They're closing the doors! Get out!

1222
01:41:48,477 --> 01:41:50,812
Get out the door! Go!

1223
01:41:51,146 --> 01:41:54,148
Go! Come on, lads! Go, lads, go!

1224
01:42:03,826 --> 01:42:05,493
Go! Go!

1225
01:42:05,994 --> 01:42:07,995
Out! Out!

1226
01:42:22,678 --> 01:42:24,345
Oh, my God.

1227
01:42:25,180 --> 01:42:26,514
That was a close shave.

1228
01:42:26,849 --> 01:42:29,767
Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!

1229
01:42:33,856 --> 01:42:36,691
Note the time. Enter it in the log.

1230
01:42:42,447 --> 01:42:44,115
What was that, Mr. Murdoch?

1231
01:42:45,033 --> 01:42:46,450
An iceberg, sir.

1232
01:42:47,536 --> 01:42:51,038
I put her hard to starboard,
but it was too close.

1233
01:42:51,373 --> 01:42:53,541
I tried to port round it, but...

1234
01:42:53,876 --> 01:42:57,044
- Close the watertight doors.
- They're closed, sir.

1235
01:43:00,215 --> 01:43:01,382
All stop.

1236
01:43:10,726 --> 01:43:12,894
Have the carpenter sound the ship.

1237
01:43:24,573 --> 01:43:27,909
Come on, let's get the hell out of here!

1238
01:43:32,748 --> 01:43:35,583
Why have the engines stopped?
I felt a shudder.

1239
01:43:35,834 --> 01:43:38,502
Not to worry. We threw a propeller blade.

1240
01:43:38,754 --> 01:43:41,589
That's the shudder you felt.
Do you need anything?

1241
01:43:42,424 --> 01:43:43,507
No, thank you.

1242
01:43:48,430 --> 01:43:50,932
There's talk of an iceberg.

1243
01:43:51,183 --> 01:43:52,934
I don't see anything. Do you?

1244
01:43:55,103 --> 01:43:58,272
If this is where the rats
are going, I am, too.

1245
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:06,948
- You.
- There is no emergency.

1246
01:44:07,199 --> 01:44:10,034
- There is. I've been robbed.
- Get the Master at Arms.

1247
01:44:10,619 --> 01:44:12,286
Now, you moron!

1248
01:44:16,959 --> 01:44:18,292
Did I miss the fun?

1249
01:44:19,461 --> 01:44:23,130
- Did you see what happened?
- No. I guess it hit over there.

1250
01:44:24,299 --> 01:44:28,552
Boiler room six is flooded eight feet
and the mail hold is worse.

1251
01:44:28,804 --> 01:44:31,222
- Can you shore up?
- Not unless the pumps get ahead.

1252
01:44:31,473 --> 01:44:34,642
- Have you seen the mail hold?
- It's already underwater.

1253
01:44:35,227 --> 01:44:36,894
This is bad.

1254
01:44:39,231 --> 01:44:40,815
We should tell Mother and Cal.

1255
01:44:41,900 --> 01:44:43,985
I think they're very good, sir.

1256
01:44:46,822 --> 01:44:49,824
Don't touch anything.
I want the room photographed.

1257
01:44:54,830 --> 01:44:56,998
We've been looking for you, miss.

1258
01:45:01,837 --> 01:45:02,920
Here we go.

1259
01:45:08,844 --> 01:45:10,261
Something serious has happened.

1260
01:45:11,847 --> 01:45:13,347
Yes, it has.

1261
01:45:14,850 --> 01:45:18,269
Indeed.
Two things dear to me have disappeared.

1262
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:22,690
Now that one is back,
I know where to find the other. Search him.

1263
01:45:22,941 --> 01:45:24,775
- Take your coat off.
- Now what?

1264
01:45:25,944 --> 01:45:29,947
What are you doing?
We're in the middle of an emergency.

1265
01:45:30,198 --> 01:45:32,283
- Is this it?
- That's it.

1266
01:45:32,868 --> 01:45:34,702
This is horseshit!

1267
01:45:36,038 --> 01:45:37,371
Don't you believe it.

1268
01:45:37,706 --> 01:45:41,042
- He couldn't have.
- Easy enough for a professional.

1269
01:45:41,293 --> 01:45:43,794
I was with him the entire time.

1270
01:45:44,046 --> 01:45:47,048
Perhaps he did it while you were putting
your clothes back on, dear.

1271
01:45:48,717 --> 01:45:50,968
Real slick. They put it in my pocket.

1272
01:45:51,219 --> 01:45:54,055
- Shut up.
- It isn't even your pocket.

1273
01:45:54,306 --> 01:45:55,806
"Property of A.L. Ryerson."

1274
01:46:00,145 --> 01:46:01,645
That was reported stolen.

1275
01:46:01,897 --> 01:46:03,481
I just borrowed it.

1276
01:46:03,732 --> 01:46:06,067
Oh, we have an honest thief.

1277
01:46:06,401 --> 01:46:08,569
You know I didn't do this, Rose.

1278
01:46:09,404 --> 01:46:11,405
Don't believe them. You know it.

1279
01:46:11,656 --> 01:46:12,656
Let's go, son.

1280
01:46:12,908 --> 01:46:14,742
You know I didn't do it!

1281
01:46:15,077 --> 01:46:18,079
There's a good lad. Come on.

1282
01:46:18,413 --> 01:46:20,748
You know I didn't do it! You know me!

1283
01:46:22,667 --> 01:46:24,919
This is most unfortunate, Captain.

1284
01:46:28,423 --> 01:46:31,842
Water fourteen feet above the keel
in ten minutes...

1285
01:46:32,094 --> 01:46:35,429
in the forepeak,
all three holds and boiler room six.

1286
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:36,680
That's right.

1287
01:46:36,932 --> 01:46:38,265
When can we get underway?

1288
01:46:38,517 --> 01:46:40,518
That's five compartments.

1289
01:46:42,437 --> 01:46:46,440
She can float with four compartments
breached, but not five.

1290
01:46:47,109 --> 01:46:50,778
Not five. As she goes down,
the water will spill...

1291
01:46:51,029 --> 01:46:55,199
over the tops of the bulkheads
at E deck, one to the next...

1292
01:46:55,450 --> 01:46:58,119
back and back. There's no stopping it.

1293
01:46:58,453 --> 01:46:59,703
The pumps.

1294
01:46:59,955 --> 01:47:03,124
The pumps buy you time, but minutes only.

1295
01:47:03,792 --> 01:47:06,043
As of now, no matter what we do...

1296
01:47:06,962 --> 01:47:09,130
Titanic will founder.

1297
01:47:11,466 --> 01:47:12,800
But this ship can't sink.

1298
01:47:13,051 --> 01:47:15,886
She's made of iron. I assure you, she can.

1299
01:47:16,471 --> 01:47:17,471
And she will.

1300
01:47:18,306 --> 01:47:20,391
It's a mathematical certainty.

1301
01:47:24,813 --> 01:47:26,313
How much time?

1302
01:47:33,822 --> 01:47:36,323
An hour. Two, at most.

1303
01:47:42,330 --> 01:47:44,415
How many aboard, Mr. Murdoch?

1304
01:47:44,833 --> 01:47:47,668
Two thousand, two hundred souls, sir.

1305
01:47:54,342 --> 01:47:57,845
Well, I believe you may get your headlines,
Mr. Ismay.

1306
01:48:15,363 --> 01:48:17,531
Oh, it is a little slut, isn't it?

1307
01:48:18,366 --> 01:48:20,534
Look at me when I'm talking to you!

1308
01:48:20,785 --> 01:48:22,953
- Mr. Hockley?
- Not now. We're busy.

1309
01:48:23,205 --> 01:48:26,624
You've been asked to put on lifebelts
and go to the boat deck.

1310
01:48:26,875 --> 01:48:27,875
I said, not now.

1311
01:48:28,126 --> 01:48:33,130
I'm sorry, Mr. Hockley, but it's
Captain's orders. Dress warmly.

1312
01:48:33,381 --> 01:48:35,549
It's quite cold out.

1313
01:48:35,884 --> 01:48:38,719
May I suggest topcoats and hats?

1314
01:48:39,054 --> 01:48:40,888
This is ridiculous.

1315
01:48:41,556 --> 01:48:45,226
Not to worry, miss.
I'm sure it's just a precaution.

1316
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:47,561
Everybody up! Lifebelts on!

1317
01:48:49,231 --> 01:48:50,814
What's he on about?

1318
01:48:51,733 --> 01:48:53,567
- Put your lifebelts on!
- What is it?

1319
01:48:53,818 --> 01:48:55,152
Just put them on.

1320
01:48:56,404 --> 01:48:57,571
C.Q. D?

1321
01:48:58,240 --> 01:48:59,406
Sir?

1322
01:49:01,076 --> 01:49:04,912
That's right, C.Q.D. The distress call.
That's our position.

1323
01:49:10,502 --> 01:49:14,755
Tell whoever responds we're going down
and need immediate assistance.

1324
01:49:24,266 --> 01:49:25,599
Blimey.

1325
01:49:35,777 --> 01:49:39,947
Keep lowering!

1326
01:49:43,785 --> 01:49:47,621
Steady! Make it taut! And winch out!

1327
01:49:51,459 --> 01:49:55,462
Uncover this boat! Uncover
all the boats aft!

1328
01:49:55,797 --> 01:49:57,464
Release those ties!

1329
01:49:57,799 --> 01:50:00,551
Roll back that cover! Smartly now!

1330
01:50:01,136 --> 01:50:02,636
Where are the passengers?

1331
01:50:02,887 --> 01:50:06,223
They went inside. Too
cold and noisy for them.

1332
01:50:06,474 --> 01:50:10,811
You there! Get down here
and help with these lines!

1333
01:50:24,993 --> 01:50:26,827
Care for a drink, sir?

1334
01:50:29,331 --> 01:50:34,251
Sonny, what's doing? You get us all trussed
up and now we're cooling our heels.

1335
01:50:34,502 --> 01:50:37,004
Sorry, ma'am. Let me go find out.

1336
01:50:37,672 --> 01:50:40,007
Nobody knows what's going on.

1337
01:50:40,258 --> 01:50:43,177
Just like the damn English...
everything by the book.

1338
01:50:43,428 --> 01:50:46,180
No need for language, Mr. Hockley.

1339
01:50:46,348 --> 01:50:51,185
Go back and turn on the heaters in our rooms.
I want a cup of tea when I return.

1340
01:51:02,030 --> 01:51:03,030
Mr. Andrews.

1341
01:51:05,033 --> 01:51:08,369
I saw the iceberg. And
I see it in your eyes.

1342
01:51:08,703 --> 01:51:10,371
Please tell me the truth.

1343
01:51:18,546 --> 01:51:20,381
The ship will sink.

1344
01:51:22,133 --> 01:51:23,133
You're certain?

1345
01:51:24,219 --> 01:51:29,056
In an hour or so, all this
will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.

1346
01:51:31,726 --> 01:51:36,063
Please, tell only who you must.
I don't want to cause a panic.

1347
01:51:36,398 --> 01:51:39,233
And get to a boat. Quickly. Don't wait.

1348
01:51:39,901 --> 01:51:43,070
You remember what I told
you about the boats?

1349
01:51:45,407 --> 01:51:46,740
Yes.

1350
01:51:48,576 --> 01:51:50,077
I understand.

1351
01:51:58,086 --> 01:51:59,420
Over here, son.

1352
01:52:00,422 --> 01:52:03,590
Sir, there's a big mob
at the Second Class Purser's office.

1353
01:52:03,925 --> 01:52:05,676
Go on. I'll watch him.

1354
01:52:06,428 --> 01:52:08,429
Aye. Right.

1355
01:52:22,110 --> 01:52:27,114
Sir, Carpathia says they're making 17 knots.
Full steam for them, sir.

1356
01:52:28,950 --> 01:52:30,367
She's the only one responding?

1357
01:52:30,618 --> 01:52:34,204
The only one close. They'll
be here in four hours.

1358
01:52:34,956 --> 01:52:36,623
Four hours?!

1359
01:52:41,629 --> 01:52:43,130
Thank you, Bride.

1360
01:52:47,469 --> 01:52:49,136
My God.

1361
01:52:58,646 --> 01:53:00,647
We are swung out and ready, sir.

1362
01:53:02,150 --> 01:53:06,069
Hadn't we better get the women and children
into the boats?

1363
01:53:07,989 --> 01:53:08,989
Yes.

1364
01:53:13,161 --> 01:53:16,330
Women and children first, yes.

1365
01:53:17,832 --> 01:53:19,166
Yes, sir.

1366
01:53:22,003 --> 01:53:24,671
Ladies and gentlemen, attention, please!

1367
01:53:25,173 --> 01:53:27,674
Step this way, please. That's right.

1368
01:53:28,009 --> 01:53:30,844
Come towards me. Thank you.

1369
01:53:31,846 --> 01:53:32,846
Good.

1370
01:53:33,097 --> 01:53:37,351
For the time being,
I require only women and children.

1371
01:53:37,852 --> 01:53:39,019
Right here.

1372
01:53:39,687 --> 01:53:43,690
Like the Captain said,
nice and cheery, so there's no panic.

1373
01:53:44,692 --> 01:53:46,026
"Wedding Dance."

1374
01:53:54,410 --> 01:53:57,037
Lifebelts on. Put your lifebelts on.

1375
01:53:57,372 --> 01:54:00,040
Put your lifebelts on. Lifebelt on.

1376
01:54:00,375 --> 01:54:03,377
Here, put that lifebelt on. Turn it around.

1377
01:54:08,716 --> 01:54:11,051
It isn't time to go to the boats yet!

1378
01:54:11,386 --> 01:54:13,053
Please, stay calm.

1379
01:54:13,388 --> 01:54:16,557
Make sure you have your lifebelts on.

1380
01:54:16,891 --> 01:54:19,309
Let women and children
through to the front.

1381
01:54:19,561 --> 01:54:20,894
What are we doing?

1382
01:54:21,145 --> 01:54:24,231
Waiting. Once first-class people
are in the boats...

1383
01:54:24,482 --> 01:54:27,818
they'll start with us
and we want to be ready.

1384
01:54:28,987 --> 01:54:31,238
Pushing won't get you out any faster.

1385
01:54:31,573 --> 01:54:32,906
Go get help.

1386
01:54:33,241 --> 01:54:37,244
Lower it away, left and
right together! Steady.

1387
01:54:37,912 --> 01:54:40,914
Both sides together! Steady!

1388
01:54:41,249 --> 01:54:44,084
Steady!

1389
01:54:45,587 --> 01:54:47,588
Stop, stop, stop!

1390
01:54:48,423 --> 01:54:49,590
Hold the left!

1391
01:54:49,924 --> 01:54:52,426
Right side only! Right side only!

1392
01:54:52,760 --> 01:54:53,927
Right side!

1393
01:54:54,262 --> 01:54:58,098
Hold the left! Right side down!
Lower away together!

1394
01:55:00,268 --> 01:55:01,935
Steady, lads!

1395
01:55:49,317 --> 01:55:52,819
You know, I do believe this ship may sink.

1396
01:55:54,822 --> 01:55:59,493
I've been asked to give you
this small token of our appreciation.

1397
01:56:01,996 --> 01:56:04,665
Compliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley.

1398
01:56:11,422 --> 01:56:14,091
Come on, sister, you heard
the man. Into the boat.

1399
01:56:14,425 --> 01:56:16,551
Any room for a gentleman,
gentlemen?

1400
01:56:16,761 --> 01:56:18,095
Only women at this time, sir.

1401
01:56:21,432 --> 01:56:23,809
Will the lifeboats be
seated according to class?

1402
01:56:25,728 --> 01:56:28,438
I hope they're not too crowded.

1403
01:56:29,232 --> 01:56:31,066
Oh, Mother, shut up!

1404
01:56:31,943 --> 01:56:33,110
Don't you understand?

1405
01:56:33,611 --> 01:56:35,320
The water is freezing and
there aren't enough boats.

1406
01:56:35,613 --> 01:56:37,239
Not enough by half.

1407
01:56:38,116 --> 01:56:40,617
Half the people on this
ship are going to die.

1408
01:56:40,952 --> 01:56:42,577
Not the better half.

1409
01:56:44,455 --> 01:56:45,497
Come on, Ruth, get in the boat.

1410
01:56:46,082 --> 01:56:47,958
First class seats
are right up here.

1411
01:56:49,127 --> 01:56:50,961
You know, it's a pity I didn't
keep that drawing.

1412
01:56:51,087 --> 01:56:52,671
It'll be worth a lot
more by morning.

1413
01:56:56,634 --> 01:56:59,302
You unimaginable bastard.

1414
01:57:00,096 --> 01:57:02,097
Come on, Rose darling.
There's plenty of room for you.

1415
01:57:03,975 --> 01:57:05,017
Come on, Rose.

1416
01:57:05,518 --> 01:57:07,144
You're next, darling.

1417
01:57:07,478 --> 01:57:08,645
Come into the boat, Rose.

1418
01:57:11,107 --> 01:57:12,107
Come.

1419
01:57:12,442 --> 01:57:13,483
Rose.

1420
01:57:14,318 --> 01:57:15,610
Get into the boat!

1421
01:57:17,113 --> 01:57:18,113
Rose.

1422
01:57:19,282 --> 01:57:20,449
Good-bye, Mother.

1423
01:57:24,620 --> 01:57:26,121
Where are you going?

1424
01:57:26,831 --> 01:57:27,831
To him?!

1425
01:57:28,791 --> 01:57:30,292
To be a whore to a gutter rat?

1426
01:57:31,502 --> 01:57:33,837
I'd rather be his whore
than your wife.

1427
01:57:36,215 --> 01:57:38,341
No!

1428
01:57:39,052 --> 01:57:41,053
I said, no!

1429
01:57:42,346 --> 01:57:44,681
Rose! Please, stop!

1430
01:57:45,975 --> 01:57:47,309
And, lower away!

1431
01:57:48,644 --> 01:57:49,644
No, Wait!

1432
01:57:49,729 --> 01:57:50,729
Lower away!

1433
01:57:50,813 --> 01:57:52,689
- Rose!
- Lower together!

1434
01:57:53,357 --> 01:57:54,733
Hold the left side!

1435
01:57:58,654 --> 01:57:59,654
Help!

1436
01:58:00,531 --> 01:58:02,657
Can anybody hear me?!

1437
01:58:04,035 --> 01:58:05,702
Hello! Help me!

1438
01:58:06,537 --> 01:58:07,537
Help me!

1439
01:58:08,372 --> 01:58:10,373
Can you hear me?!

1440
01:58:10,708 --> 01:58:14,711
Can anybody hear me?!
Somebody help me!

1441
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:17,380
Mr. Andrews?!

1442
01:58:21,052 --> 01:58:23,220
Steward, check the
starboard corridor.

1443
01:58:23,513 --> 01:58:26,014
Madame, please put on a lifebelt.
Get to the boat deck immediately.

1444
01:58:26,557 --> 01:58:29,184
Lucy, for God's sake put on your
lifebelt and set a good example.

1445
01:58:29,268 --> 01:58:30,268
Yes sir.

1446
01:58:30,895 --> 01:58:32,229
- Anyone in here?
- Mr. Andrews!

1447
01:58:32,563 --> 01:58:34,397
Mr. Andrews! Thank God!

1448
01:58:34,690 --> 01:58:37,025
Where would the Master at Arms
take someone under arrest?

1449
01:58:37,610 --> 01:58:38,902
What? You have to get
to a boat right away.

1450
01:58:39,028 --> 01:58:40,028
No!

1451
01:58:40,071 --> 01:58:42,364
I'm doing this with or
without your help, sir.

1452
01:58:42,907 --> 01:58:43,907
But without will take longer.

1453
01:58:46,869 --> 01:58:49,037
Take the elevator to the
very bottom. Go to the left...

1454
01:58:49,205 --> 01:58:50,372
down the crewmen's passage.

1455
01:58:50,414 --> 01:58:53,125
Then go right and left
again at the stairs.

1456
01:58:53,292 --> 01:58:54,543
You'll come to a long corridor.

1457
01:58:59,423 --> 01:59:01,091
This could be bad.

1458
01:59:04,929 --> 01:59:07,597
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

1459
01:59:12,937 --> 01:59:14,938
Excuse me. Thank you.

1460
01:59:18,442 --> 01:59:21,444
I'm sorry, miss,
but the lifts are closed.

1461
01:59:22,280 --> 01:59:25,115
I'm through being polite,
goddamnit!

1462
01:59:25,241 --> 01:59:26,324
Now take me down!

1463
01:59:27,618 --> 01:59:28,952
E deck.

1464
01:59:32,290 --> 01:59:33,623
Come on.

1465
01:59:34,083 --> 01:59:35,417
Come on, come on.

1466
01:59:53,269 --> 01:59:54,603
I'm going back up.

1467
01:59:54,645 --> 01:59:56,813
No! No! No!

1468
02:00:00,985 --> 02:00:02,819
Come back! I'm going back up!

1469
02:00:03,154 --> 02:00:04,154
I'm going back up!

1470
02:00:13,164 --> 02:00:14,164
Crew passage.

1471
02:00:37,521 --> 02:00:38,521
Jack!

1472
02:00:51,327 --> 02:00:52,327
Rose!

1473
02:00:54,747 --> 02:00:56,164
Rose, I'm in here!

1474
02:00:56,749 --> 02:00:59,709
I'm in here!

1475
02:01:01,921 --> 02:01:03,922
Jack! I'm sorry.

1476
02:01:04,257 --> 02:01:06,591
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1477
02:01:07,593 --> 02:01:08,969
That guy Lovejoy put
it in my pocket.

1478
02:01:09,011 --> 02:01:10,929
I know, I know, I know.

1479
02:01:11,013 --> 02:01:12,055
Listen Rose...

1480
02:01:12,181 --> 02:01:14,641
you're gonna have to find
the spare key, all right?

1481
02:01:14,684 --> 02:01:16,017
Look in that
cabinet right there.

1482
02:01:17,561 --> 02:01:19,479
It's a little silver one, Rose.

1483
02:01:22,066 --> 02:01:23,566
These are all brass ones!

1484
02:01:24,443 --> 02:01:25,944
Check right here, Rose.

1485
02:01:30,533 --> 02:01:31,533
Rose.

1486
02:01:32,868 --> 02:01:34,452
How did you find out I didn't do it?

1487
02:01:34,912 --> 02:01:35,912
I didn't.

1488
02:01:36,038 --> 02:01:38,039
I just realized I already knew.

1489
02:01:40,626 --> 02:01:41,626
Keep looking.

1490
02:01:50,970 --> 02:01:52,012
No key.

1491
02:01:52,555 --> 02:01:53,555
There's no key!

1492
02:01:53,639 --> 02:01:54,639
All right, Rose, listen.

1493
02:01:54,974 --> 02:01:56,349
You're gonna have
to go find some help.

1494
02:01:57,226 --> 02:01:58,226
It'll be all right.

1495
02:02:03,649 --> 02:02:05,066
I'll be right back.

1496
02:02:12,658 --> 02:02:14,492
I'll just wait here!

1497
02:02:27,798 --> 02:02:29,007
Hello? Is there anyone here?

1498
02:02:30,217 --> 02:02:31,217
Hello?

1499
02:02:31,844 --> 02:02:33,470
Is there anybody down here?

1500
02:02:34,680 --> 02:02:36,473
We need help! Hello?

1501
02:02:38,184 --> 02:02:39,184
Damnit!

1502
02:02:45,691 --> 02:02:49,527
Can anybody hear me, please?!
Hello?! Hello?!

1503
02:02:51,530 --> 02:02:52,864
Oh, thank God.

1504
02:02:53,199 --> 02:02:54,324
Wait, please, I need your help.

1505
02:02:54,617 --> 02:02:55,617
There's a man back
here and he's...

1506
02:02:56,494 --> 02:02:57,494
Wait!

1507
02:03:01,707 --> 02:03:03,041
Hello?!

1508
02:03:28,818 --> 02:03:29,859
Hello?

1509
02:03:31,320 --> 02:03:32,821
Miss, you shouldn't
be here now.

1510
02:03:33,114 --> 02:03:34,322
I need your help.

1511
02:03:34,698 --> 02:03:36,449
There is a man down
here and he is trapped.

1512
02:03:36,659 --> 02:03:37,659
- This way, yes. All right.
- Please!

1513
02:03:37,993 --> 02:03:39,828
- There's no need to panic.
- No, I'm not panicking!

1514
02:03:40,079 --> 02:03:41,913
You're going the wrong way!

1515
02:03:42,248 --> 02:03:43,998
Let go of me! Listen!!!

1516
02:03:49,672 --> 02:03:50,672
To hell with you.

1517
02:04:28,627 --> 02:04:30,128
Oh, my God.

1518
02:05:22,181 --> 02:05:23,765
Will this work?

1519
02:05:24,683 --> 02:05:25,767
I guess we'll find out.

1520
02:05:26,435 --> 02:05:27,435
Come on.

1521
02:05:30,523 --> 02:05:31,523
Wait, wait, wait.

1522
02:05:32,191 --> 02:05:33,691
Try a couple practice
swings over there.

1523
02:05:39,907 --> 02:05:40,907
Good.

1524
02:05:41,200 --> 02:05:42,992
Now try and hit the same mark
again, Rose. You can do it.

1525
02:05:49,708 --> 02:05:52,168
Okay, that's enough practice.
Come on, Rose.

1526
02:05:52,336 --> 02:05:53,920
You can do it.

1527
02:05:54,213 --> 02:05:57,882
Listen, just hit it really hard
and really fast.

1528
02:05:59,260 --> 02:06:00,552
Come on. Wait.

1529
02:06:00,636 --> 02:06:02,887
Open your
hands up a little more.

1530
02:06:03,222 --> 02:06:04,556
- Like that?
- Right.

1531
02:06:05,558 --> 02:06:07,600
Listen, Rose, I trust you.

1532
02:06:12,565 --> 02:06:13,565
Go.

1533
02:06:19,905 --> 02:06:20,947
You did it!

1534
02:06:21,574 --> 02:06:22,907
Come on. Let's go.

1535
02:06:23,576 --> 02:06:25,577
Oh shit, this is cold!
Oh, shit!

1536
02:06:25,911 --> 02:06:27,495
Shit! Shit!

1537
02:06:33,085 --> 02:06:34,168
This is the way out.

1538
02:06:35,254 --> 02:06:37,755
We have to find
another way. Come on.

1539
02:06:40,801 --> 02:06:41,801
Pull.

1540
02:06:42,845 --> 02:06:43,845
Put your backs into it.

1541
02:06:49,810 --> 02:06:50,810
Pull!

1542
02:06:51,770 --> 02:06:54,606
Now, there's something
you don't see every day.

1543
02:07:16,462 --> 02:07:19,297
What's this luggage doing here?
Get rid of it. Get rid of it.

1544
02:07:19,423 --> 02:07:20,506
We need the room.
Get rid of that. Out.

1545
02:07:22,384 --> 02:07:25,386
This way.
Let go, sir. Get back.

1546
02:07:25,638 --> 02:07:26,971
Keep calm!

1547
02:07:34,313 --> 02:07:35,313
Lovejoy!

1548
02:07:35,689 --> 02:07:37,690
She's not on the starboard side either.

1549
02:07:37,983 --> 02:07:41,986
We're running out of time. This strutting
martinet isn't letting any men on at all.

1550
02:07:42,655 --> 02:07:44,656
There's one on the other
side letting men on.

1551
02:07:45,324 --> 02:07:46,616
Well then, that's our play.

1552
02:07:46,784 --> 02:07:49,452
We'll need some
insurance first. Come on.

1553
02:07:50,329 --> 02:07:52,413
This way, please.
All the way down here.

1554
02:07:55,501 --> 02:07:56,501
Here!

1555
02:07:57,711 --> 02:07:59,003
What do you think you're doing?

1556
02:07:59,505 --> 02:08:01,506
You'll have to pay for
that, you know.

1557
02:08:01,757 --> 02:08:03,508
That's White Star
Line property.

1558
02:08:03,842 --> 02:08:05,343
Shut up!

1559
02:08:06,178 --> 02:08:09,347
Will you hold the boat a moment?
I just have to run back to my room...

1560
02:08:10,182 --> 02:08:11,224
Sit down!

1561
02:08:11,850 --> 02:08:12,892
She's the last.

1562
02:08:13,060 --> 02:08:14,811
- Prepare to lower.
- Mr. Lightoller.

1563
02:08:14,978 --> 02:08:16,896
Why are the boats being
launched half full?

1564
02:08:17,189 --> 02:08:18,189
Not now, Mr. Andrews.

1565
02:08:18,440 --> 02:08:21,609
There, look. 20 or so
in a boat built for 65?

1566
02:08:21,860 --> 02:08:23,861
And I saw one boat
with only 12. 12!

1567
02:08:24,196 --> 02:08:27,240
Well, we weren't sure of
the weight, Mr. Andrews.

1568
02:08:27,449 --> 02:08:28,574
These boats may buckle.

1569
02:08:28,784 --> 02:08:29,784
Rubbish!

1570
02:08:30,035 --> 02:08:32,704
They were tested in Belfast
with the weight of 70 men.

1571
02:08:33,122 --> 02:08:35,581
Now, fill these boats, Mr. Lightoller.
For God's sake man!

1572
02:08:42,881 --> 02:08:45,717
Please, I need more women
and children, please!

1573
02:08:51,056 --> 02:08:52,223
Get back in there!

1574
02:08:52,558 --> 02:08:55,059
This is not an exit.
This is not an exit.

1575
02:08:57,646 --> 02:09:00,314
You can't keep us locked in here.
Like animals. The ship's bloody sinking.

1576
02:09:01,567 --> 02:09:03,568
Bring forward the women!

1577
02:09:03,902 --> 02:09:05,403
Unlock the gates.

1578
02:09:06,238 --> 02:09:08,239
Women only!

1579
02:09:08,907 --> 02:09:12,410
No men!

1580
02:09:16,915 --> 02:09:21,169
Get back!

1581
02:09:21,253 --> 02:09:22,628
Lock the gates!

1582
02:09:23,422 --> 02:09:24,797
Get them back from those gates!

1583
02:09:26,175 --> 02:09:27,467
Don't touch the gates!

1584
02:09:31,096 --> 02:09:32,472
For God's sake, man...

1585
02:09:32,598 --> 02:09:34,140
there are women and
children down here!

1586
02:09:34,433 --> 02:09:36,768
Let us up so we can have a chance!

1587
02:09:37,811 --> 02:09:38,811
Get back!

1588
02:09:42,566 --> 02:09:43,691
Tommy!

1589
02:09:43,776 --> 02:09:45,276
- Can we get out?
- It's hopeless that way.

1590
02:09:45,611 --> 02:09:47,028
Whatever we do,
we've got to do it fast.

1591
02:09:50,783 --> 02:09:52,200
The boats are all going.

1592
02:09:52,534 --> 02:09:54,285
This whole place is flooding.
We've gotta get out of here.

1593
02:09:54,453 --> 02:09:55,495
There is niente this way.

1594
02:09:56,622 --> 02:09:57,872
Let's go this way, all right?
Come on!

1595
02:10:03,962 --> 02:10:05,129
I make my own luck.

1596
02:10:05,464 --> 02:10:06,964
So do I.

1597
02:10:14,807 --> 02:10:16,140
Come on!

1598
02:10:16,642 --> 02:10:17,683
No, come on, let's go this way.

1599
02:10:27,236 --> 02:10:28,402
This way!

1600
02:10:29,279 --> 02:10:30,655
Just go back to
the main stairwell.

1601
02:10:31,824 --> 02:10:33,115
And everything will be
sorted out there.

1602
02:10:34,576 --> 02:10:36,410
It will all get sorted out back there.

1603
02:10:36,787 --> 02:10:37,912
Go back to the main stairwell.

1604
02:10:38,038 --> 02:10:39,997
- Open the gate!
- Go back down the main stairwell.

1605
02:10:40,249 --> 02:10:41,582
Open the gate right now!

1606
02:10:41,834 --> 02:10:43,918
Go back down the main
stairwell, like I told you.

1607
02:10:46,171 --> 02:10:48,673
Goddamn it! Son of a bitch!

1608
02:10:49,007 --> 02:10:50,675
Stop that!

1609
02:10:54,596 --> 02:10:55,638
Fabri, Tommy,
give me a hand here.

1610
02:10:55,722 --> 02:10:56,722
Move aside.

1611
02:10:56,807 --> 02:10:58,975
Come on, pull!

1612
02:10:59,852 --> 02:11:00,852
Pull!

1613
02:11:01,854 --> 02:11:03,145
Move aside.
Quickly, move aside!

1614
02:11:03,272 --> 02:11:04,272
Put that down!

1615
02:11:04,356 --> 02:11:05,606
- Move aside!
- Put that down!

1616
02:11:05,691 --> 02:11:07,024
One! Two!

1617
02:11:07,943 --> 02:11:09,110
Three!

1618
02:11:11,363 --> 02:11:12,530
Again!

1619
02:11:14,533 --> 02:11:15,575
Now, let's go!

1620
02:11:17,911 --> 02:11:18,953
Let's go, Rose.

1621
02:11:19,037 --> 02:11:21,205
You can't go up there!
You can't do this!

1622
02:11:27,546 --> 02:11:29,380
Keep order! Keep order here!

1623
02:11:29,715 --> 02:11:32,550
Back! Back! Back!

1624
02:11:37,139 --> 02:11:38,139
Hold on to her!

1625
02:11:39,725 --> 02:11:40,766
Pull her in!

1626
02:11:41,727 --> 02:11:44,228
Get back, I say, or I'll...

1627
02:11:44,563 --> 02:11:46,731
shoot you all like dogs!

1628
02:11:47,065 --> 02:11:48,566
Keep order here!

1629
02:11:49,568 --> 02:11:51,736
Keep order, I say.

1630
02:11:52,571 --> 02:11:54,739
Mr. Lowe, man this boat.

1631
02:11:59,244 --> 02:12:03,414
Right. Is everybody all right?
Nobody panic.

1632
02:12:09,588 --> 02:12:11,255
Stay back.

1633
02:12:11,757 --> 02:12:12,924
We're too late.

1634
02:12:13,175 --> 02:12:16,260
There are more boats down the front.
Stay with this one. Murdoch.

1635
02:12:16,511 --> 02:12:18,054
He seems to be quite practical.

1636
02:12:22,768 --> 02:12:24,268
Don't lower it!

1637
02:12:24,770 --> 02:12:26,771
Cut the falls!

1638
02:12:32,277 --> 02:12:34,111
Sit down!

1639
02:12:35,447 --> 02:12:36,864
Stay back, you lot!

1640
02:12:37,115 --> 02:12:40,284
Just stay back, the
lot of you! Stay back!

1641
02:12:42,955 --> 02:12:45,623
It's starting to fall apart.
We don't have much time.

1642
02:12:47,292 --> 02:12:48,626
Mr. Murdoch?

1643
02:12:48,961 --> 02:12:51,462
Mr. Hockley.
You two, with me, now!

1644
02:12:51,713 --> 02:12:53,297
I'm a businessman, as you know...

1645
02:12:53,465 --> 02:12:55,049
and I have a business
proposition for you.

1646
02:13:02,808 --> 02:13:03,975
Come on, Rose.

1647
02:13:07,479 --> 02:13:08,479
The boats are gone!

1648
02:13:14,152 --> 02:13:15,820
Colonel, are there
any boats on that side?

1649
02:13:16,071 --> 02:13:18,447
No, miss, but there are a couple
of boats all the way forward.

1650
02:13:18,615 --> 02:13:20,199
This way, I'll lead you.

1651
02:13:26,415 --> 02:13:29,750
What's the use?
Nobody's listening to us anyway.

1652
02:13:30,002 --> 02:13:31,544
Well, they don't listen to
us at dinner, either.

1653
02:13:31,670 --> 02:13:32,753
Come on, let's play.

1654
02:13:32,879 --> 02:13:34,213
Keep us warm.

1655
02:13:35,007 --> 02:13:36,340
"Orpheus."

1656
02:13:41,179 --> 02:13:43,973
Music to drown by.
Now I know I'm in first class.

1657
02:13:49,855 --> 02:13:53,190
- Where is everyone?
- They're all still aft, sir.

1658
02:13:55,193 --> 02:13:57,361
We have an understanding
then, Mr. Murdoch.

1659
02:14:08,707 --> 02:14:12,710
Will the men please hold
back! Hold back, I say!

1660
02:14:15,047 --> 02:14:17,840
Women and children only!

1661
02:14:18,008 --> 02:14:19,925
Get back!

1662
02:14:20,218 --> 02:14:22,887
Come through, madame.
This way. Step back, sir!

1663
02:14:24,389 --> 02:14:27,224
You better check the
other side. Go!

1664
02:14:34,566 --> 02:14:36,400
I found her, on the other side.

1665
02:14:37,069 --> 02:14:38,486
Waiting for a boat.

1666
02:14:38,987 --> 02:14:39,987
With him.

1667
02:14:41,656 --> 02:14:43,741
- Any more women and children?
- They're all aboard, Mr. Murdoch.

1668
02:14:44,076 --> 02:14:45,910
Anyone else then?

1669
02:14:47,496 --> 02:14:48,913
- Anyone else?
- Do hurry. Hurry along.

1670
02:14:55,087 --> 02:14:57,088
Goddamn it all to hell.

1671
02:14:59,758 --> 02:15:01,092
Shit.

1672
02:15:01,384 --> 02:15:02,384
Fire!

1673
02:15:03,804 --> 02:15:05,721
Sir, sir, you can't
go through here.

1674
02:15:09,351 --> 02:15:11,685
That's it. Splendid. Right.

1675
02:15:15,607 --> 02:15:17,274
Prepare to lower.

1676
02:15:19,444 --> 02:15:21,278
Ready on the left.

1677
02:15:27,202 --> 02:15:28,869
Take them down.

1678
02:15:33,708 --> 02:15:35,042
Keep it steady.

1679
02:15:37,712 --> 02:15:41,632
Both sides together.
Steady. Keep it steady.

1680
02:15:42,676 --> 02:15:44,009
- Give her to me.
- Daddy.

1681
02:15:44,845 --> 02:15:47,179
It'll be fine, darling.
Don't you worry.

1682
02:15:47,514 --> 02:15:49,181
Daddy, get in the boat.

1683
02:15:49,516 --> 02:15:52,351
It's good-bye for a little
while. Only for a little while.

1684
02:15:52,602 --> 02:15:54,645
There'll be another
boat for the daddies.

1685
02:15:55,230 --> 02:15:56,397
This boat is for the
mummies and the children.

1686
02:15:56,523 --> 02:15:58,607
You hold Mummy's hand
and be a good little girl.

1687
02:16:00,110 --> 02:16:01,443
I'm not going without you.

1688
02:16:01,695 --> 02:16:03,237
No, you have to go, now.

1689
02:16:03,363 --> 02:16:04,363
No, Jack.

1690
02:16:04,489 --> 02:16:05,781
Get in the boat, Rose.

1691
02:16:05,866 --> 02:16:07,032
No, Jack.

1692
02:16:07,117 --> 02:16:08,117
Yes.

1693
02:16:08,201 --> 02:16:09,201
Get on the boat!

1694
02:16:09,286 --> 02:16:11,620
Yes, get on the boat, Rose.

1695
02:16:14,457 --> 02:16:15,624
Oh my God, look at you.

1696
02:16:15,876 --> 02:16:17,710
You look a fright.

1697
02:16:17,794 --> 02:16:18,794
Here.

1698
02:16:20,547 --> 02:16:22,715
Put this on. Come.

1699
02:16:27,721 --> 02:16:29,555
Go on. I'll get the next one.

1700
02:16:29,806 --> 02:16:31,640
No, not without you.

1701
02:16:31,892 --> 02:16:33,726
I'll be all right.
Listen, I'll be fine.

1702
02:16:34,060 --> 02:16:35,895
I'm a survivor, all right?
Don't worry about me.

1703
02:16:36,229 --> 02:16:37,521
Now, go on. Get on.

1704
02:16:38,064 --> 02:16:39,690
I have an arrangement with an
officer on the other side of the ship.

1705
02:16:40,150 --> 02:16:41,692
Jack and I can get off safely.

1706
02:16:42,235 --> 02:16:43,235
Both of us.

1707
02:16:44,404 --> 02:16:45,487
See?

1708
02:16:45,572 --> 02:16:46,614
I got my own boat to catch.

1709
02:16:47,407 --> 02:16:48,407
Go on, hurry.

1710
02:16:48,491 --> 02:16:49,909
They're almost full.

1711
02:16:51,411 --> 02:16:52,536
- Step aboard, miss.
- Go. Go.

1712
02:16:54,414 --> 02:16:55,581
Step aboard, please.

1713
02:16:55,874 --> 02:16:57,291
You're daddy's
good girl, all right?

1714
02:16:57,375 --> 02:16:58,500
You're my little sailor.

1715
02:17:02,756 --> 02:17:03,756
Clear the rail, please.

1716
02:17:05,425 --> 02:17:06,675
And, lower away!

1717
02:17:20,523 --> 02:17:21,857
You're a good liar.

1718
02:17:22,609 --> 02:17:24,443
Almost as good as you.

1719
02:17:29,115 --> 02:17:32,785
There's no... there's no
arrangement, is there?

1720
02:17:34,120 --> 02:17:35,621
No, there is.

1721
02:17:35,956 --> 02:17:38,123
Not that you'll benefit much from it.

1722
02:17:40,043 --> 02:17:41,710
I always win, Jack.

1723
02:17:42,796 --> 02:17:44,463
One way or another.

1724
02:18:42,605 --> 02:18:43,647
Rose!

1725
02:18:46,026 --> 02:18:47,026
Stop her!

1726
02:18:47,777 --> 02:18:48,777
Rose, what are you doing?!

1727
02:18:50,864 --> 02:18:51,864
No!

1728
02:19:14,888 --> 02:19:17,556
Rose! You're so stupid!
Why did you do that?

1729
02:19:17,891 --> 02:19:19,892
You're so stupid, Rose.

1730
02:19:21,227 --> 02:19:22,895
Why did you do that? Why?!

1731
02:19:24,230 --> 02:19:26,231
You jump, I jump, right?

1732
02:19:28,068 --> 02:19:29,109
Right.

1733
02:19:31,780 --> 02:19:33,364
Oh God. I couldn't go.

1734
02:19:34,324 --> 02:19:35,824
I couldn't go, Jack.

1735
02:19:35,909 --> 02:19:37,576
It's all right. We'll
think of something.

1736
02:19:39,245 --> 02:19:40,746
- At least I'm with you.
- We'll think of something.

1737
02:19:55,220 --> 02:19:56,261
Come on! Move!

1738
02:19:59,599 --> 02:20:00,599
Come on! Move.

1739
02:20:07,399 --> 02:20:08,399
Come on!

1740
02:20:16,533 --> 02:20:17,533
Move!

1741
02:20:23,790 --> 02:20:25,290
Come on! Come on Rose.

1742
02:20:27,877 --> 02:20:28,877
Rose, come on!

1743
02:20:31,881 --> 02:20:32,923
Move Rose!

1744
02:20:36,010 --> 02:20:37,010
Go!

1745
02:20:47,605 --> 02:20:50,315
I hope you enjoy your time together!

1746
02:21:04,330 --> 02:21:06,665
What could possibly be funny?

1747
02:21:08,084 --> 02:21:09,835
I put the diamond in the coat.

1748
02:21:12,589 --> 02:21:14,506
And I put the coat on her!

1749
02:21:16,259 --> 02:21:17,342
Come on!

1750
02:21:37,614 --> 02:21:39,031
Dada!

1751
02:21:41,367 --> 02:21:42,493
We can't leave him.

1752
02:21:47,040 --> 02:21:48,373
All right, come on!

1753
02:21:50,043 --> 02:21:52,211
Dada!

1754
02:22:05,308 --> 02:22:06,642
Go back!

1755
02:22:17,362 --> 02:22:18,529
It's the wrong way! Come back!

1756
02:22:18,613 --> 02:22:21,198
No, not that way!
Come back! Stop!

1757
02:22:26,246 --> 02:22:27,412
Go!

1758
02:22:29,749 --> 02:22:33,418
Go! Run!

1759
02:22:59,112 --> 02:23:00,112
This way!

1760
02:23:12,292 --> 02:23:13,458
Give me your hand!

1761
02:23:22,468 --> 02:23:23,802
Oh, God!

1762
02:23:28,141 --> 02:23:29,741
Help!

1763
02:23:37,942 --> 02:23:39,026
Wait, sir!

1764
02:23:39,110 --> 02:23:40,652
Sir, open the gate, please!

1765
02:23:40,903 --> 02:23:42,070
Help us, please!

1766
02:23:42,322 --> 02:23:43,488
Help us!

1767
02:23:43,656 --> 02:23:44,823
- Please!
- Please!

1768
02:23:46,492 --> 02:23:47,826
Bloody hell!

1769
02:23:53,499 --> 02:23:55,500
- Come on, come on!
- Come on!

1770
02:23:55,835 --> 02:23:57,169
Go, go!

1771
02:23:57,420 --> 02:23:58,420
Jesus.

1772
02:23:59,505 --> 02:24:00,505
- Please!
- Come on!

1773
02:24:00,757 --> 02:24:02,007
Hurry!

1774
02:24:02,884 --> 02:24:03,925
Come on!

1775
02:24:08,514 --> 02:24:10,265
I'm sorry, I dropped the keys.

1776
02:24:11,517 --> 02:24:13,685
- Wait, please!
- Wait!

1777
02:24:14,020 --> 02:24:16,521
Don't leave! Please,
send for help!

1778
02:24:35,208 --> 02:24:37,209
I got it! Which
one is it, Rose?

1779
02:24:37,543 --> 02:24:39,544
The short one.
Try the short one.

1780
02:24:40,546 --> 02:24:41,546
Hurry, Jack.

1781
02:24:45,218 --> 02:24:46,885
Oh no! It won't go in.

1782
02:24:47,804 --> 02:24:48,804
Hurry, Jack.

1783
02:24:51,391 --> 02:24:53,308
It's stuck! It's stuck!

1784
02:24:54,560 --> 02:24:56,228
- Come on!
- Hurry, Jack!

1785
02:24:57,897 --> 02:24:59,564
- Hurry, Jack!
- Come on!

1786
02:25:02,235 --> 02:25:04,236
I got it! I got it!
Go! Go, Rose!

1787
02:25:05,238 --> 02:25:06,571
Go! Go!

1788
02:25:18,918 --> 02:25:21,253
Jack! Come on!

1789
02:25:23,256 --> 02:25:24,756
Move, move.

1790
02:25:34,600 --> 02:25:36,435
- Get those oars in place.
- Get an oar under it.

1791
02:25:41,607 --> 02:25:43,275
Hold it! Hold it!

1792
02:25:43,609 --> 02:25:44,943
Hold it!

1793
02:25:54,871 --> 02:25:59,124
Get these davits cranked in!
Let's get the falls hooked up!

1794
02:26:11,304 --> 02:26:13,138
Mommy!

1795
02:26:19,812 --> 02:26:20,896
Keep going up!

1796
02:26:24,150 --> 02:26:25,650
Stop pushing!

1797
02:26:27,820 --> 02:26:29,154
Stay back!

1798
02:26:29,405 --> 02:26:31,907
Will you give us a chance
to live, you limey bastard!

1799
02:26:32,158 --> 02:26:34,659
I'll shoot any man who tries
to get past me! Get back!

1800
02:26:34,827 --> 02:26:35,911
Bastard!

1801
02:26:36,162 --> 02:26:37,662
Get back!

1802
02:26:37,830 --> 02:26:38,914
We had a deal, damn you!

1803
02:26:42,335 --> 02:26:45,337
Your money can't save you
any more than it could save me.

1804
02:26:45,463 --> 02:26:46,463
Get back!

1805
02:26:47,673 --> 02:26:49,591
Women and children only!

1806
02:26:58,518 --> 02:26:59,851
No, Tommy!

1807
02:27:18,579 --> 02:27:19,579
No, Will!

1808
02:27:26,462 --> 02:27:27,963
Now stand back, damn you!

1809
02:27:31,300 --> 02:27:34,803
Gently, gently. Hold it. Hold it.

1810
02:27:44,480 --> 02:27:46,147
I have a child!

1811
02:27:46,482 --> 02:27:48,608
- I have a child!
- Clear a path here!

1812
02:27:48,985 --> 02:27:50,986
Please, I have a child!

1813
02:27:51,821 --> 02:27:54,489
Please. I'm all she has in the world.

1814
02:27:55,449 --> 02:27:56,491
Go on.

1815
02:27:56,826 --> 02:27:57,826
Step back!

1816
02:27:58,327 --> 02:27:59,661
- Please?
- Here, give her to me.

1817
02:28:00,371 --> 02:28:01,788
You're all right, dearie.

1818
02:28:04,876 --> 02:28:05,959
Give her here.

1819
02:28:07,879 --> 02:28:08,879
There, there.

1820
02:28:13,175 --> 02:28:16,011
Wait, wait, wait! Mr. Andrews!

1821
02:28:18,514 --> 02:28:19,514
Oh, Rose.

1822
02:28:22,518 --> 02:28:23,852
Won't you even
make a try for it?

1823
02:28:25,855 --> 02:28:30,358
I'm sorry that I didn't build you
a stronger ship, young Rose.

1824
02:28:32,194 --> 02:28:34,529
It's going fast.
We have to move.

1825
02:28:34,822 --> 02:28:35,822
Wait.

1826
02:28:38,868 --> 02:28:40,327
Good luck to you, Rose.

1827
02:28:42,371 --> 02:28:43,371
And to you.

1828
02:28:56,344 --> 02:28:57,385
Mr. Guggenheim?

1829
02:28:57,845 --> 02:28:59,012
These are for you, Mr. Guggenheim.

1830
02:28:59,221 --> 02:29:00,221
No, thank you.

1831
02:29:00,389 --> 02:29:04,267
We are dressed in our best and are
prepared to go down as gentlemen.

1832
02:29:05,061 --> 02:29:07,020
But we would like a brandy.

1833
02:29:07,730 --> 02:29:10,231
Get the falls over here now!

1834
02:29:10,900 --> 02:29:13,360
Let them drop. Then we'll right it.

1835
02:29:18,616 --> 02:29:19,741
Capitán?

1836
02:29:20,242 --> 02:29:22,577
Capitán, where should I go? Please.

1837
02:29:29,919 --> 02:29:31,920
Captain. Captain. Sir.

1838
02:30:02,410 --> 02:30:04,619
Right. That's it, then.

1839
02:30:05,454 --> 02:30:07,080
Good-bye, Wally. Good luck.

1840
02:30:08,124 --> 02:30:09,290
- Good-bye, Wallace.
- So long, old chap.

1841
02:31:24,533 --> 02:31:29,037
And so they lived happily
together for 300 years...

1842
02:31:29,371 --> 02:31:31,539
in the land of Tir na nog...

1843
02:31:32,541 --> 02:31:35,210
Land of eternal
youth and beauty.

1844
02:32:10,579 --> 02:32:11,913
There's no time!

1845
02:32:12,081 --> 02:32:13,456
Cut those falls!

1846
02:32:13,707 --> 02:32:15,875
Cut them!
Cut them if you have to!

1847
02:32:16,585 --> 02:32:19,254
I need a knife!

1848
02:32:20,923 --> 02:32:22,590
Cut the falls now!

1849
02:32:23,217 --> 02:32:24,592
Cut them loose!

1850
02:32:35,104 --> 02:32:36,938
Cut those bloody falls!

1851
02:33:24,612 --> 02:33:25,945
Gentlemen...

1852
02:33:26,447 --> 02:33:29,115
it has been a privilege
playing with you tonight.

1853
02:34:29,927 --> 02:34:31,803
We have to stay on the
ship as long as possible.

1854
02:34:31,971 --> 02:34:32,971
Come on!

1855
02:34:45,025 --> 02:34:46,693
This way. Through the rail.

1856
02:34:48,946 --> 02:34:50,280
Come on, Rose.

1857
02:34:50,614 --> 02:34:51,614
Jump.

1858
02:34:53,951 --> 02:34:55,034
Come on.

1859
02:35:28,319 --> 02:35:29,902
I got you. Jump.

1860
02:35:32,573 --> 02:35:34,407
I've got you, miss.

1861
02:35:38,245 --> 02:35:39,412
Back!

1862
02:36:09,610 --> 02:36:11,277
No! You'll swamp us!

1863
02:36:24,041 --> 02:36:27,126
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death...

1864
02:36:27,461 --> 02:36:30,213
You wanna walk a little faster
through that valley there?

1865
02:37:20,514 --> 02:37:22,014
Holy Mary, mother of God...

1866
02:37:22,182 --> 02:37:25,143
pray for us sinners now and
at the hour of our death. Amen.

1867
02:37:25,853 --> 02:37:26,936
Hail Mary, full of grace...

1868
02:37:27,020 --> 02:37:28,104
This way.

1869
02:37:38,449 --> 02:37:40,533
Come on!

1870
02:37:50,210 --> 02:37:52,628
And I saw a new heaven
and a new earth...

1871
02:37:52,880 --> 02:37:56,382
for the first heaven and the first earth
had passed away...

1872
02:37:57,468 --> 02:37:59,051
and there was no more sea.

1873
02:38:05,559 --> 02:38:08,644
It'll be over soon.
It'll all be over soon.

1874
02:38:14,234 --> 02:38:15,735
And He shall dwell with them.

1875
02:38:15,903 --> 02:38:20,323
And they shall be His people
and God Himself shall be with them...

1876
02:38:20,657 --> 02:38:22,074
and be their God.

1877
02:38:22,826 --> 02:38:23,910
Jack...

1878
02:38:24,912 --> 02:38:26,913
this is where we first met.

1879
02:38:33,962 --> 02:38:37,173
And God shall wipe away
all the tears from their eyes...

1880
02:38:37,508 --> 02:38:39,592
and there shall be
no more death.

1881
02:38:40,093 --> 02:38:42,595
Neither shall there be
sorrow or crying.

1882
02:38:43,096 --> 02:38:45,598
Neither shall there
be any more pain...

1883
02:38:46,433 --> 02:38:49,185
for the former world
has passed away.

1884
02:39:03,617 --> 02:39:05,952
Bloody pull faster! And pull!

1885
02:39:29,226 --> 02:39:30,560
Hang on, miss Trudy!

1886
02:40:06,513 --> 02:40:08,014
Hold on real tight.

1887
02:40:25,532 --> 02:40:27,366
God Almighty.

1888
02:40:34,833 --> 02:40:37,376
Keep those breakers in!
Keep them in!

1889
02:41:56,373 --> 02:41:57,790
We have to move!

1890
02:42:03,714 --> 02:42:05,089
Give me your hand.
I'll pull you over.

1891
02:42:05,132 --> 02:42:06,132
I can't.

1892
02:42:06,258 --> 02:42:07,258
Come on!

1893
02:42:07,342 --> 02:42:08,384
Give me your hand.

1894
02:42:10,137 --> 02:42:12,138
I've got you. I won't let go.

1895
02:42:12,723 --> 02:42:13,764
Come on, I've got you.

1896
02:42:24,985 --> 02:42:28,154
- What's happening, Jack?
- I don't know. I don't know.

1897
02:42:37,330 --> 02:42:38,330
Hold on.

1898
02:43:20,707 --> 02:43:21,874
This is it!

1899
02:43:33,887 --> 02:43:37,556
Oh, my God, Jack!
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1900
02:43:38,225 --> 02:43:39,558
Hold on!

1901
02:43:54,574 --> 02:43:56,534
The ship is gonna suck us down.

1902
02:43:56,576 --> 02:43:58,786
Take a deep breath when I say.

1903
02:44:04,417 --> 02:44:06,585
Kick for the surface
and keep kicking.

1904
02:44:06,628 --> 02:44:07,962
Do not let go of my hand.

1905
02:44:15,679 --> 02:44:16,929
We're going to make it, Rose.

1906
02:44:16,972 --> 02:44:17,972
Trust me.

1907
02:44:18,098 --> 02:44:19,348
I trust you.

1908
02:44:24,437 --> 02:44:26,438
Ready! Ready!

1909
02:44:26,940 --> 02:44:27,940
Now!

1910
02:45:04,311 --> 02:45:06,145
Jack! Jack!

1911
02:45:49,189 --> 02:45:50,189
Rose!

1912
02:45:50,690 --> 02:45:53,025
Get off her! Get off her!

1913
02:45:57,238 --> 02:45:58,906
Swim, Rose! I need you to swim!

1914
02:46:03,703 --> 02:46:05,371
Keep swimming.

1915
02:46:09,042 --> 02:46:10,376
It's so cold.

1916
02:46:10,627 --> 02:46:11,961
Swim, Rose!

1917
02:46:16,549 --> 02:46:17,883
Come on.

1918
02:46:19,886 --> 02:46:20,970
Keep swimming.

1919
02:46:21,221 --> 02:46:22,554
Come on.

1920
02:46:24,516 --> 02:46:25,557
Here...

1921
02:46:25,684 --> 02:46:26,850
get on it.

1922
02:46:27,560 --> 02:46:29,061
Get on top.

1923
02:46:36,444 --> 02:46:37,903
Come on, Rose.

1924
02:46:47,455 --> 02:46:49,123
Stay on it. Stay on, Rose.

1925
02:47:10,979 --> 02:47:16,483
It'll be all right now.

1926
02:47:23,825 --> 02:47:24,992
Return...

1927
02:47:25,201 --> 02:47:26,869
the boats!

1928
02:47:30,999 --> 02:47:33,125
The boats are coming
back for us Rose.

1929
02:47:33,668 --> 02:47:35,127
Hold on just a
little bit longer.

1930
02:47:36,004 --> 02:47:38,672
They had to row
away for the suction...

1931
02:47:38,882 --> 02:47:40,966
but now they'll be coming back.

1932
02:47:44,012 --> 02:47:45,345
For God's sake!

1933
02:47:45,638 --> 02:47:46,847
Please...

1934
02:47:47,182 --> 02:47:48,474
help us!

1935
02:47:53,855 --> 02:47:55,564
You don't understand.

1936
02:47:56,399 --> 02:47:58,567
If we go back, they'll
swamp the boat.

1937
02:47:58,818 --> 02:48:00,152
They'll pull us right down,
I'm telling you.

1938
02:48:00,695 --> 02:48:03,197
Oh, knock it off.
You're scaring me.

1939
02:48:03,531 --> 02:48:06,033
Come on, girls, grab
an oar. Let's go.

1940
02:48:06,326 --> 02:48:09,495
Are you out of your mind?
We're in the middle of the North Atlantic.

1941
02:48:09,704 --> 02:48:13,040
Now, do you people want to live
or do you want to die?!

1942
02:48:20,006 --> 02:48:22,216
I don't understand a one of you.

1943
02:48:24,052 --> 02:48:25,177
What's the matter with you?

1944
02:48:26,179 --> 02:48:27,596
It's your men out there!

1945
02:48:30,058 --> 02:48:31,725
There's plenty of room for more.

1946
02:48:32,018 --> 02:48:33,685
And there'll be one less
on this boat...

1947
02:48:34,020 --> 02:48:37,397
if you don't shut that
hole in your face!

1948
02:48:53,248 --> 02:48:57,376
Now, bring in your oars over there.
And tie these boats together as well.

1949
02:49:01,756 --> 02:49:04,091
Now, make sure that's
tied up nice and tight.

1950
02:49:07,595 --> 02:49:10,264
Right, listen to me, men.
We have to go back.

1951
02:49:10,598 --> 02:49:14,101
I want to transfer all the women
from this boat into that boat right now...

1952
02:49:14,227 --> 02:49:15,394
as quick as you can, please.

1953
02:49:15,436 --> 02:49:17,938
Let's create some space over there.
Move forward and aft.

1954
02:49:27,949 --> 02:49:29,783
It's getting quiet.

1955
02:49:31,953 --> 02:49:35,289
It's just going to take a
couple of minutes...

1956
02:49:35,790 --> 02:49:37,791
to get the boats organized.

1957
02:49:40,628 --> 02:49:42,296
I don't know about you but...

1958
02:49:42,630 --> 02:49:46,133
I intend to write
a strongly worded letter...

1959
02:49:46,467 --> 02:49:48,093
to the White Star Line
about all this.

1960
02:49:56,477 --> 02:49:58,145
I love you, Jack.

1961
02:50:04,819 --> 02:50:06,320
Don't you do that.

1962
02:50:07,822 --> 02:50:10,991
Don't you say your
good-byes. Not yet.

1963
02:50:11,326 --> 02:50:12,826
Do you understand me?

1964
02:50:13,161 --> 02:50:14,995
I'm so cold.

1965
02:50:15,496 --> 02:50:16,997
Listen, Rose...

1966
02:50:18,166 --> 02:50:19,833
you're gonna get out of here.

1967
02:50:21,002 --> 02:50:22,502
You're gonna go on...

1968
02:50:23,838 --> 02:50:25,631
and you're gonna
make lots of babies.

1969
02:50:26,341 --> 02:50:28,342
And you're gonna
watch them grow.

1970
02:50:30,011 --> 02:50:31,136
You're gonna die an old...

1971
02:50:31,304 --> 02:50:32,554
an old lady.

1972
02:50:32,847 --> 02:50:34,514
Warm in her bed.

1973
02:50:36,184 --> 02:50:37,309
Not here.

1974
02:50:38,186 --> 02:50:40,687
Not this night. Not like this.

1975
02:50:41,022 --> 02:50:42,689
Do you understand me?

1976
02:50:45,693 --> 02:50:47,861
I can't feel my body.

1977
02:50:49,530 --> 02:50:50,989
Winning that ticket, Rose...

1978
02:50:51,157 --> 02:50:53,742
was the best thing that
ever happened to me.

1979
02:50:55,370 --> 02:50:57,204
It brought me to you.

1980
02:50:58,831 --> 02:51:01,291
And I'm thankful
for that, Rose.

1981
02:51:01,834 --> 02:51:03,168
I'm thankful.

1982
02:51:06,631 --> 02:51:07,714
You must...

1983
02:51:08,841 --> 02:51:10,842
you must do me this honor.

1984
02:51:13,846 --> 02:51:17,349
You must promise me
that you'll survive.

1985
02:51:19,352 --> 02:51:21,019
That you won't give up...

1986
02:51:22,188 --> 02:51:24,189
no matter what happens.

1987
02:51:26,859 --> 02:51:29,194
No matter how hopeless.

1988
02:51:32,365 --> 02:51:34,533
Promise me now, Rose.

1989
02:51:36,703 --> 02:51:39,037
And never let go
of that promise.

1990
02:51:40,707 --> 02:51:42,040
I promise.

1991
02:51:44,168 --> 02:51:45,836
Never let go.

1992
02:51:48,715 --> 02:51:50,841
I'll never let go, Jack.

1993
02:51:53,553 --> 02:51:55,220
I'll never let go.

1994
02:52:19,329 --> 02:52:20,829
Right ahead, sir.

1995
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:25,500
Oars!

1996
02:52:26,002 --> 02:52:27,669
Do you see any moving?

1997
02:52:28,671 --> 02:52:30,589
No, sir. None moving, sir.

1998
02:52:31,174 --> 02:52:32,507
Check them.

1999
02:52:32,842 --> 02:52:34,343
Bring that oar up here.

2000
02:52:41,017 --> 02:52:42,017
Check them. Make sure.

2001
02:52:43,436 --> 02:52:45,062
These are dead, sir.

2002
02:52:45,563 --> 02:52:46,730
Now, give way.

2003
02:52:47,190 --> 02:52:48,231
Ahead easy.

2004
02:52:55,031 --> 02:52:56,531
Careful with your oars.

2005
02:52:57,116 --> 02:52:58,158
Don't hit them.

2006
02:53:00,703 --> 02:53:03,038
Is there anyone
alive out there?

2007
02:53:04,540 --> 02:53:06,375
Can anyone hear me?

2008
02:53:08,544 --> 02:53:10,879
Is there anyone
alive out there?

2009
02:53:17,720 --> 02:53:18,929
We waited too long.

2010
02:53:22,850 --> 02:53:24,601
Well, keep checking them!

2011
02:53:24,727 --> 02:53:26,395
Keep looking!

2012
02:53:27,230 --> 02:53:29,731
Is there anyone
alive out there?

2013
02:53:33,236 --> 02:53:35,237
Can anyone hear me?

2014
02:53:46,416 --> 02:53:49,251
Come, Josephine...

2015
02:53:49,752 --> 02:53:54,256
in my flying machine

2016
02:53:55,758 --> 02:53:58,969
And it's up she goes

2017
02:54:00,930 --> 02:54:02,931
Up she goes

2018
02:54:08,438 --> 02:54:10,605
Come, Josephine...

2019
02:54:12,942 --> 02:54:15,277
in my flying...

2020
02:54:39,135 --> 02:54:40,735
Jack.

2021
02:55:00,156 --> 02:55:01,490
There's a boat.

2022
02:55:14,670 --> 02:55:16,004
Jack.

2023
02:55:28,518 --> 02:55:30,519
There's a boat, Jack.

2024
02:56:14,230 --> 02:56:16,230
Come back.

2025
02:56:27,577 --> 02:56:29,911
Come back. Come back!

2026
02:56:31,414 --> 02:56:32,914
Hello!

2027
02:56:35,042 --> 02:56:36,918
Can anyone hear me?

2028
02:56:37,420 --> 02:56:39,087
There's nothing here, sir.

2029
02:56:41,591 --> 02:56:45,760
Come back.

2030
02:56:53,603 --> 02:56:55,103
I'll never let go.

2031
02:56:55,354 --> 02:56:56,688
I promise.

2032
02:57:39,774 --> 02:57:41,608
Come about!

2033
02:58:02,963 --> 02:58:06,800
Fifteen hundred people
went into the sea...

2034
02:58:07,134 --> 02:58:10,136
when Titanic
sank from under us.

2035
02:58:11,972 --> 02:58:15,141
There were twenty
boats floating nearby...

2036
02:58:16,310 --> 02:58:18,645
and only one came back.

2037
02:58:20,481 --> 02:58:21,606
One.

2038
02:58:23,317 --> 02:58:25,985
Six were saved
from the water...

2039
02:58:26,487 --> 02:58:28,154
myself included.

2040
02:58:29,323 --> 02:58:30,615
Six...

2041
02:58:31,826 --> 02:58:33,702
out of fifteen hundred.

2042
02:58:36,997 --> 02:58:38,331
Afterward...

2043
02:58:39,500 --> 02:58:41,501
the seven hundred
people in the boats...

2044
02:58:42,294 --> 02:58:44,379
had nothing to do but wait.

2045
02:58:46,006 --> 02:58:47,674
Wait to die.

2046
02:58:48,175 --> 02:58:49,676
Wait to live.

2047
02:58:50,845 --> 02:58:53,012
Wait for an absolution...

2048
02:58:53,514 --> 02:58:55,348
that would never come.

2049
02:59:59,580 --> 03:00:02,040
Sir, I don't think you'll find any
of your people down here.

2050
03:00:02,208 --> 03:00:03,625
It's all steerage.

2051
03:00:06,587 --> 03:00:10,131
His hair is reddish brown,
reddish brown, reddish brown.

2052
03:00:10,257 --> 03:00:11,633
White beard.

2053
03:00:12,092 --> 03:00:13,718
Isn't there another
passenger list?

2054
03:00:13,761 --> 03:00:14,886
There is no other list.

2055
03:00:15,054 --> 03:00:16,471
Perhaps he's on another ship.

2056
03:00:16,764 --> 03:00:18,598
We're doing all we can,
ma'am. I'm so sorry.

2057
03:00:41,956 --> 03:00:44,624
That's the last time
I ever saw him.

2058
03:00:45,125 --> 03:00:48,628
He married. Of course.
And inherited his millions.

2059
03:00:49,296 --> 03:00:52,799
But the Crash of '29 hit
his interests hard...

2060
03:00:53,133 --> 03:00:55,426
and he put a pistol in
his mouth that year.

2061
03:00:55,970 --> 03:00:57,804
Or so I read.

2062
03:01:10,651 --> 03:01:12,110
Can I take your name
please, love?

2063
03:01:15,155 --> 03:01:16,489
Dawson.

2064
03:01:18,659 --> 03:01:20,159
Rose Dawson.

2065
03:01:21,495 --> 03:01:22,662
Thank you.

2066
03:01:29,670 --> 03:01:31,796
We never found
anything on Jack.

2067
03:01:31,964 --> 03:01:33,882
There's no record
of him at all.

2068
03:01:34,508 --> 03:01:36,843
No, there wouldn't
be, would there?

2069
03:01:37,177 --> 03:01:39,888
And I've never spoken
of him until now.

2070
03:01:40,639 --> 03:01:41,681
Not to anyone.

2071
03:01:42,850 --> 03:01:44,851
Not even your grandfather.

2072
03:01:45,185 --> 03:01:49,188
A woman's heart is a
deep ocean of secrets.

2073
03:01:50,024 --> 03:01:53,693
But now you know there was
a man named Jack Dawson...

2074
03:01:54,028 --> 03:01:56,029
and that he saved me...

2075
03:01:56,363 --> 03:01:59,699
in every way that
a person can be saved.

2076
03:02:01,702 --> 03:02:04,370
I don't even have
a picture of him.

2077
03:02:06,874 --> 03:02:10,710
He exists now only
in my memory.

2078
03:02:15,549 --> 03:02:19,052
Keldysh, Mir 2 on our
way to the surface.

2079
03:02:35,569 --> 03:02:38,363
I was saving this for when
I found the diamond.

2080
03:02:47,748 --> 03:02:49,248
I'm sorry.

2081
03:02:51,919 --> 03:02:53,419
Three years...

2082
03:02:54,088 --> 03:02:56,756
I've thought of
nothing except Titanic.

2083
03:02:57,591 --> 03:02:59,425
But I never got it.

2084
03:03:02,554 --> 03:03:04,430
I never let it in.

2084
03:03:05,305 --> 03:04:05,414
