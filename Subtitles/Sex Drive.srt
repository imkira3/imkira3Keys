Hello, my name is Sean Anders.
Screenwriter and director of <i>Sex Drive.</i>

2
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,270
Hi, John. I didn't see you there.

3
00:00:14,346 --> 00:00:19,181
- This is John Morris.
- Screenwriter and producer of <i>Sex Drive.</i>

4
00:00:19,251 --> 00:00:22,084
- Welcome to the unrated...
- Uncircumcised...

5
00:00:22,154 --> 00:00:23,451
...edition of...

6
00:00:23,522 --> 00:00:25,422
<i>...Sex Drive.</i>
<i>- Sex Drive.</i>

7
00:00:25,491 --> 00:00:28,007
How many times has
this happened to you?

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,394
You purchase an unrated DVD to view
with your friends. Only with your friends...

9
00:00:32,464 --> 00:00:36,594
Only to find that you got the same
old movie with a few extra curse words,

10
00:00:36,668 --> 00:00:38,966
and maybe an additional tit or two.

11
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:41,097
- What a jip.
- And how...

12
00:00:41,173 --> 00:00:42,504
Not this time.

13
00:00:42,574 --> 00:00:46,738
That's right, John.
On this unrated DVD we promise you,

14
00:00:46,812 --> 00:00:48,143
the viewer,

15
00:00:49,214 --> 00:00:53,173
a genuinely wacky, zany
and unrated viewing experience.

16
00:00:53,252 --> 00:00:56,153
- We promise...
- Plus, we promise more tits.

17
00:00:56,221 --> 00:00:58,485
Bare tits like these.

18
00:01:00,225 --> 00:01:02,056
These tits are good.

19
00:01:03,062 --> 00:01:06,031
Plus, more cock, like this.

20
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:09,066
That's good cock, John.

21
00:01:09,501 --> 00:01:13,801
That's right, John, and that's not all,
we promise lots of additional scenes,

22
00:01:13,872 --> 00:01:18,206
takes and other bullshit
that will make the movie way too long.

23
00:01:18,277 --> 00:01:21,041
And this means a lower standard
of filmmaking for you,

24
00:01:21,113 --> 00:01:22,102
- the viewer.
- The viewer.

25
00:01:22,347 --> 00:01:26,875
So, if you've never seen <i>Sex Drive</i> before,
please, for real,

26
00:01:26,952 --> 00:01:29,420
do not watch this version first.

27
00:01:29,488 --> 00:01:33,219
Watch the real theatrical version
and then come back and watch this one.

28
00:01:33,292 --> 00:01:34,384
Why?

29
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:39,022
Yes, because this version
of the movie is going to suck.

30
00:01:46,138 --> 00:01:50,097
Sorry, but I couldn't help but notice you.
I have this exact same tribal tattoo.

31
00:01:50,175 --> 00:01:52,143
Mine's one my... It's on my back.

32
00:01:52,211 --> 00:01:56,011
But actually I have a town car outside
if you wanna go see...

33
00:02:03,122 --> 00:02:05,317
All right.
Why don't you do one more?

35
00:02:26,078 --> 00:02:29,070
We open up against Michigan
in two weeks.

36
00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:32,949
Coach's got me hitting the bench
pretty hard.

37
00:02:38,123 --> 00:02:41,251
Shit. How much is a lot?

38
00:02:42,995 --> 00:02:45,088
One... No, two.

39
00:02:50,068 --> 00:02:52,935
I'm putting up three hundy.

40
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,873
Well, let's see, Tasty.

41
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:10,313
Wow!

42
00:03:11,823 --> 00:03:12,812
Um...

43
00:03:14,793 --> 00:03:17,762
Wow, you're really pretty. I've never seen...

44
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,324
No, stop it, stop it.

45
00:03:19,398 --> 00:03:23,164
Don't be so fucking desperate.
Come on, be a dick. Be cool.

46
00:03:25,137 --> 00:03:27,867
<i>Don't be a pussy.</i>
<i>Tell her she's an ugly skank.</i>

47
00:03:30,943 --> 00:03:32,501
Yeah.

48
00:03:32,578 --> 00:03:33,806
Not bad.

49
00:03:35,247 --> 00:03:36,407
I've seen better.

50
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,378
Yeah, whatever.

51
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:49,051
Coach's got us running two-a-days,
so I gotta bounce.

52
00:04:12,317 --> 00:04:15,980
Miss Tasty? How did you get here?

53
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:18,178
Shh!

54
00:05:37,936 --> 00:05:40,370
Ian, wake up, faggot. Judge rolls in 20,

55
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:42,498
so if you want a ride to work
you better get your poop in a group.

56
00:05:42,574 --> 00:05:44,701
- Okay, I'll be right down.
- No. Now, Clay Aiken.

57
00:05:44,776 --> 00:05:46,767
- All right.
- No, now, homo.

58
00:05:46,845 --> 00:05:48,870
- Just give me a minute.
- No, no, no, no. Now, sissy.

59
00:05:48,947 --> 00:05:51,711
- Just...
- No, now, chode-stroker.

60
00:05:52,884 --> 00:05:54,374
Now, ball bag.

61
00:06:01,093 --> 00:06:02,287
Hey...

62
00:06:02,494 --> 00:06:04,792
- Ow! Cut it out.
- Hurts, doesn't it?

63
00:06:04,863 --> 00:06:06,990
Shut up! I'm trying to sleep.

64
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:11,233
Hey, Big D, sorry. Go back to sleep.
You're golden.

65
00:06:11,303 --> 00:06:14,033
- You, get your ass up.
- Give me a minute.

66
00:06:14,272 --> 00:06:15,796
What're you doing under there, huh?

67
00:06:15,874 --> 00:06:19,310
What're you doing?
You're firing off your skin pistol?

68
00:06:19,711 --> 00:06:21,372
Come on, get up. What are you hiding?

69
00:06:21,446 --> 00:06:23,437
You got a big fattie under there, don't you?

70
00:06:23,515 --> 00:06:27,747
Yeah, you do. You're stroking it, too.
What the F?

71
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,456
Your little brother's sleeping
not ten feet away. Jesus Christ!

72
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,224
Good. My boys are all here.

73
00:06:34,292 --> 00:06:36,260
- Dad, Ian's free...
- Can it, Rex.

74
00:06:36,328 --> 00:06:39,764
Your pop's got a bombshell to drop,
so ears open.

75
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:42,800
Last night,
your old man popped the question.

76
00:06:44,002 --> 00:06:45,663
Show them, Karen.

77
00:06:48,373 --> 00:06:50,034
I'm so happy.

78
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:54,879
Hey, way to go!

79
00:06:54,946 --> 00:06:58,404
Ian, you wanna get off your duff
and come over here and give Karen a hug?

80
00:06:58,483 --> 00:06:59,472
Um...

81
00:07:00,018 --> 00:07:04,751
- Yeah, Ian, come on. You're being rude.
- Can we do that later?

82
00:07:04,823 --> 00:07:08,281
- Damn it, Ian, get up...
- No, no, honey. It's okay.

83
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,260
We have to give him time
to get used to the idea.

84
00:07:15,634 --> 00:07:16,623
Karen?
- Are you okay?

85
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:18,760
Karen? Karen, honey?
- You okay?

86
00:07:18,837 --> 00:07:19,826
Sweetheart?

87
00:07:20,405 --> 00:07:22,270
What smells like jizz?

88
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:30,241
Let's go! Kick it in the ass, dildo!

89
00:07:40,258 --> 00:07:43,557
Come on, get in. Get in!

90
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,167
You suck!

91
00:07:55,173 --> 00:07:58,336
Okay, seriously.
Quit being such a fag and get in.

92
00:08:03,348 --> 00:08:05,839
<i> Never go down</i>
<i>So let's get it up</i>

93
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:13,580
Ian, I'm gonna ask you a question,
and I want a straight answer.

94
00:08:13,992 --> 00:08:15,857
- You queer?
- What?

95
00:08:15,927 --> 00:08:18,395
- God damn it! I knew it!
- I didn't say anything.

96
00:08:18,463 --> 00:08:20,761
Exactly. If someone asks you
if you're a pole smoker,

97
00:08:20,832 --> 00:08:24,268
you just deny it, straight off.
No pause, no farting around.

98
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:25,735
Rex, I'm not gay.

99
00:08:25,804 --> 00:08:27,795
- Dad thinks you're gay.
- What?

100
00:08:27,873 --> 00:08:31,001
- You're breaking the old man's heart.
- No, I'm not. I told him I'm not.

101
00:08:31,076 --> 00:08:34,204
Ian, you're 18,
and you've never had a girlfriend.

102
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:36,975
That's how people wind up getting gay,
you know.

103
00:08:37,048 --> 00:08:39,016
I don't think that's really how it happens.

104
00:08:39,084 --> 00:08:41,484
Is that not how it happens?
So tell me how it happens, expert.

105
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:43,987
Fucking cock expert. Cockspert.

106
00:08:44,055 --> 00:08:46,046
Hey, what do you like better,
the shaft or the balls?

107
00:08:46,157 --> 00:08:49,217
- That's gross.
- You like them both, don't you?

108
00:08:49,394 --> 00:08:53,831
It's like, sometimes like, Tuesdays you want
the big, old fucking shiny-ass cock,

109
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:57,300
and Wednesdays and Thursdays
you're on to the balls.

110
00:08:57,369 --> 00:08:59,564
- I don't know why you're talking about it.
- You can't choose, can you?

111
00:08:59,638 --> 00:09:02,539
That's a tough one.
You love it and you're obsessed with it.

112
00:09:02,607 --> 00:09:05,041
No, you are. You keep talking about it.

113
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,873
Why're you smiling at me? I'm serious.

114
00:09:06,945 --> 00:09:09,880
Don't fucking smile at me. You know
I'll knock you out of this goddamn earth.

115
00:09:09,948 --> 00:09:11,813
What does it taste like?

116
00:09:11,883 --> 00:09:14,249
Like, right when you take your mouth off
and it's like kind of

117
00:09:14,319 --> 00:09:17,550
like you can almost see your reflection
in that fucking cock.

118
00:09:17,622 --> 00:09:19,783
Smack you in the face with it a little bit.

119
00:09:19,858 --> 00:09:21,985
- You don't like that?
- I don't eat...

120
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:28,966
Just cut. Just like, shiny fucking stiff,
hot vascular mushroom head.

121
00:09:29,034 --> 00:09:30,228
Yeah, yeah.

122
00:09:30,302 --> 00:09:32,566
Look, every guy's got a fantasy
about another guy,

123
00:09:32,637 --> 00:09:36,368
but you got to bury that shit way down.
This is America, God damn it.

124
00:09:36,441 --> 00:09:40,434
There is...
There is a girl that I've been kind of...

125
00:09:40,512 --> 00:09:43,413
All right, I'm listening.
Where'd you meet her?

126
00:09:43,481 --> 00:09:45,039
On the... Online.

127
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:50,209
What? For fuck's sake, Ian,
don't you watch <i>Dateline?</i>

128
00:09:50,322 --> 00:09:54,691
She's probably a guy. Some fat old dude
who wants to ram you in the tailpipe.

129
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:58,320
But you'd love that, wouldn't you?
'Cause you're a homo.

130
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:16,575
Hey, Ian. Try not to come home any gayer
than you are now.

131
00:10:18,984 --> 00:10:21,885
Seriously, though. You're a fag.

132
00:10:21,953 --> 00:10:24,979
Hey, don't look at me like that.
I'll punch you in the goddamn throat.

133
00:10:34,032 --> 00:10:38,128
<i> Hey</i>

134
00:10:38,737 --> 00:10:42,195
<i>What's your favorite song?</i>

135
00:10:42,273 --> 00:10:45,106
<i>Maybe we could hum along</i>

136
00:10:46,311 --> 00:10:52,682
<i>Well, I think you're smart,</i>
<i>you sweet thing</i>

137
00:10:53,818 --> 00:10:58,585
<i>Tell me your name,</i>
<i>I'm dying here</i>

138
00:11:04,195 --> 00:11:07,653
<i>Got you where I want you</i>

139
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,323
<i>Yeah</i>

140
00:11:18,243 --> 00:11:24,648
- Hey, Becca. How are you?
- I'm good. I'm fine. Whatever.

141
00:11:24,749 --> 00:11:28,879
Hey, Becca.
Looks like you had a long, nasty night.

142
00:11:28,953 --> 00:11:32,787
- Ron and Ian want the <i>four-one-uno.</i>
- Whatever. You guys are gross.

143
00:11:32,857 --> 00:11:37,419
- I'm not gross. I didn't say anything.
- Okay, who's going on coupon rounds?

144
00:11:39,998 --> 00:11:43,297
- No, Becca, I did it yesterday.
- Please, Ian.

145
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,299
I love you so much.

146
00:11:48,506 --> 00:11:53,068
Hello. This is a coupon for six free...
No? Okay. Sorry. Donuts? No.

147
00:11:54,145 --> 00:11:55,772
- Six free donuts with the Bandito's Dozen.
- Thanks.

148
00:11:55,847 --> 00:11:57,439
You're welcome. Sorry.

149
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,341
Excuse me. Do you know where the Gap is?

150
00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:05,480
- It's just past the movie theater.
- Thanks, man.

151
00:12:09,928 --> 00:12:11,395
Yeah, real funny.

152
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,325
Free donuts, free coupons.

153
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:19,901
Felicia. How's it fitting, hon?

154
00:12:31,983 --> 00:12:35,441
Well, you look nice.

155
00:12:36,187 --> 00:12:38,348
You know, sweetie,
there's still time to have your boobs done

156
00:12:38,423 --> 00:12:39,583
before my wedding.

157
00:12:39,657 --> 00:12:42,125
Darren and I already discussed them,
and he said he'd pay for it.

158
00:12:42,193 --> 00:12:45,356
I mean, he's a dentist,
so it's totally not a big deal.

159
00:12:46,731 --> 00:12:48,824
Excuse me, do you have a pair of scissors?

160
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,959
Oh! Sure, sweetie. Do you have a stringie?

161
00:12:51,035 --> 00:12:54,527
Oh, no. I was just hoping
you could slit my wrists for me quickly.

162
00:12:54,606 --> 00:12:57,404
My husband killed himself last Christmas.

163
00:12:59,144 --> 00:13:02,739
I am so sorry. I was just...

164
00:13:03,014 --> 00:13:07,610
Hello. This is a coupon
for six free donuts. Donuts?

165
00:13:13,858 --> 00:13:19,262
Oh, my God! You look so hot in that.

166
00:13:19,731 --> 00:13:22,666
Hey, sweetheart, listen.
Please don't take this the wrong way,

167
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:24,668
but your whole trying too hard thing,

168
00:13:24,736 --> 00:13:27,398
it's just coming across as needy,
you know?

169
00:13:27,472 --> 00:13:29,804
And I think you're better than that,
Kimberly.

170
00:13:29,874 --> 00:13:34,777
- But all I was saying was that...
- Shh! Let's see it in a large. Okay?

171
00:13:34,946 --> 00:13:36,937
I mean, Christ,
I'm out buying him clothes right now.

172
00:13:37,015 --> 00:13:40,883
He's 18 years old.
I don't have to do that shit anymore.

173
00:13:40,952 --> 00:13:45,480
Look, Judy, listen, I'm sorry,
I'm losing you. I'm going into a tunnel.

174
00:13:47,091 --> 00:13:50,822
Well, it's official, Lance,
your mom's still bat-shit crazy.

175
00:13:50,895 --> 00:13:53,193
What? You're telling me
she doesn't shit-talk me?

176
00:13:53,264 --> 00:13:56,165
No, actually, she doesn't. She doesn't, ever.

177
00:13:56,234 --> 00:13:59,067
All right. Let me give you some advice,
Lance, all right?

178
00:13:59,137 --> 00:14:02,129
Don't ever get married.
Just an endless parade of horseshit.

179
00:14:02,207 --> 00:14:05,904
And whatever you do, man,
always wear a rubber. Christ.

180
00:14:05,977 --> 00:14:08,810
Nice. Always classy.

181
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,646
Hey, come on, Lance, I didn't mean it like...
Come on, dawg.

182
00:14:16,321 --> 00:14:20,189
Hey, sir. I've got something yummy
for your little girl.

183
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,696
Oh, my God. Excuse me! Sorry!

184
00:14:32,103 --> 00:14:36,096
- Ian? Oh, my God, dude, what happened?
- I don't know.

185
00:14:36,174 --> 00:14:38,574
Is there a cock and balls
on the front of me again?

186
00:14:38,643 --> 00:14:41,134
- Like a little tree trunk.
- Thank you.

187
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,145
Oh, my God.

188
00:14:47,118 --> 00:14:51,077
- Whoa. You look pretty.
- God, shut up, Ian!

189
00:14:51,155 --> 00:14:55,057
What? I'm just saying,
you usually dress so... You look nice.

190
00:14:55,126 --> 00:14:57,458
Ian, why do you got to work the mouth
when you talk to us?

191
00:14:57,528 --> 00:15:01,020
- Yeah, Ian.
- Sorry, it's a... It's a habit.

192
00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:04,125
Hey, that girl you work with, Becca,
you gonna bring her to my party tonight?

193
00:15:04,202 --> 00:15:08,901
- Yeah, I asked her. She said no.
- Good. Dude, she's totally wrong for you.

194
00:15:08,973 --> 00:15:11,441
That's what you say about everyone.

195
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:13,500
She made you wear
the fucking costume again, right?

196
00:15:13,578 --> 00:15:16,012
- You know, I don't mind...
- Dude, if you told her to fuck off,

197
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,413
she'd be two knuckles deep right now
daydreaming about your big black cock.

198
00:15:19,484 --> 00:15:20,678
Ian, do not listen to him.

199
00:15:20,752 --> 00:15:23,448
Okay, girls want a nice guy
who's gonna treat them well.

200
00:15:23,521 --> 00:15:25,148
- Really?
- Yes. Really.

201
00:15:25,223 --> 00:15:27,453
Look, all I'm saying is
everybody wants a challenge.

202
00:15:27,525 --> 00:15:29,925
- Everybody wants...
- What they can't get. I know, I got it.

203
00:15:29,994 --> 00:15:33,327
Do you get it? 'Cause I mean, it feels like
I'm teaching you to walk sometimes.

204
00:15:33,398 --> 00:15:37,391
- That shit does not work.
- It works on you.

205
00:15:37,468 --> 00:15:39,231
No, it doesn't.

206
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:45,308
Felicia!

207
00:15:45,576 --> 00:15:49,342
Balls! I got to go.
Evil cousin's spending the weekend.

208
00:15:49,414 --> 00:15:52,281
- Pretty cousin?
- Ian, she's the anti-Christ.

209
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:55,478
- She's still super hot.
- Fuck you, too. See you.

210
00:15:56,521 --> 00:15:57,613
So what happened with Becca?

211
00:15:57,689 --> 00:15:59,281
You been doing like I told you,
being a dick?

212
00:15:59,357 --> 00:16:03,817
Yeah, kind of. Being kind of a dick.
I'd say... No, not really.

213
00:16:04,762 --> 00:16:06,730
I mean, you know,
I've sort of been practicing

214
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:09,995
your whole being-a-dick thing
with this girl I met online.

215
00:16:10,068 --> 00:16:12,036
- And I get it, but I just...
- Thanks.

216
00:16:12,103 --> 00:16:13,934
I don't think I could do that for real.

217
00:16:14,005 --> 00:16:16,098
Dude, sure you can.
I believe in you, you know.

218
00:16:16,174 --> 00:16:19,940
You just got to stop worrying
about being the good guy all the time.

219
00:16:20,011 --> 00:16:22,104
I mean, okay,
look at Andy and Randy over there.

220
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,045
You think they care
what women think about them?

221
00:16:24,148 --> 00:16:26,048
They could give a fuck.

222
00:16:26,651 --> 00:16:29,381
- What's up? What's up?
- What's up, what's up?

223
00:16:29,454 --> 00:16:32,821
Hi. I'm collecting for
the underprivileged children of Ecuador.

224
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,289
- Would you like to help?
- Not really.

225
00:16:34,392 --> 00:16:36,826
- We don't have any money.
- No jobs.

226
00:16:37,662 --> 00:16:39,129
You wanna party?

227
00:16:39,197 --> 00:16:41,358
Um... I'm kind of working right now.

228
00:16:41,432 --> 00:16:43,764
- When are you done?
- Yeah, what are you doing after?

229
00:16:43,835 --> 00:16:45,393
I have a church thing tonight.

230
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,404
- Kick ass, we'll come.
- Yeah, where is it?

231
00:16:47,472 --> 00:16:49,497
Is there gonna be
more hot snatch like you there?

232
00:16:49,574 --> 00:16:52,566
Those guys are total nards.
They never get anywhere.

233
00:16:52,643 --> 00:16:54,577
That's just 'cause they don't know
how to close.

234
00:16:54,645 --> 00:16:56,272
But they're ability to open
is fucking heroic.

235
00:16:56,614 --> 00:16:59,048
- Do you wear thong underpants?
- Do you want us to take our shirts off?

236
00:16:59,117 --> 00:17:01,449
- What color bra are you wearing?
- Is your mom hot, too?

237
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,111
Are you into me?

238
00:17:03,187 --> 00:17:04,916
- Where do you live?
- What color car do you have?

239
00:17:04,989 --> 00:17:06,650
- Where do you live?
- What's your address?

240
00:17:06,758 --> 00:17:08,419
- Do you want us to come over?
- Do you like pizza?

241
00:17:08,493 --> 00:17:10,393
We've been to a motel.

242
00:17:14,265 --> 00:17:18,133
- Fuck off, donut.
- Rex, it's me.

243
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:21,304
What the fuck is this all about?

244
00:17:21,372 --> 00:17:25,274
I broke the key off of our locker.
I couldn't get my clothes out.

245
00:17:25,343 --> 00:17:29,245
Stow that shit in the trunk.
Christ, you look like a Mexican butt-hole.

246
00:17:33,885 --> 00:17:35,750
You suck.

247
00:17:39,323 --> 00:17:41,188
Becca? Hey.

248
00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:44,628
Wow, I didn't know
that you were coming over.

249
00:17:45,496 --> 00:17:50,661
Cool. I didn't even know
that you knew where I lived. I mean...

250
00:17:50,735 --> 00:17:53,397
- Yeah, I do.
- Yeah.

251
00:17:53,471 --> 00:17:56,907
- So...
- Oh! It's a funny story. I broke...

252
00:17:56,974 --> 00:18:00,774
I broke my key off
and Ron let me borrow the...

253
00:18:00,845 --> 00:18:04,576
Anyway, so this is great.
You changed your mind.

254
00:18:04,649 --> 00:18:05,877
Now, the party, it doesn't start

255
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:09,784
- for a few hours.
- Actually, I was wondering if Dylan's here.

256
00:18:12,123 --> 00:18:14,591
- Dylan?
- Yeah. Is he here?

257
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:17,059
- My 14-year-old brother Dylan?
- Yeah.

258
00:18:17,128 --> 00:18:22,088
Nice underpants, Ian.
- Snap! Dang, that was funny.

259
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,157
You know he's 14, right?

260
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,315
Laura, Cindy, this shit is totally gratuitous.
I love it.

261
00:18:56,767 --> 00:18:59,463
- Hey, congrats. Good to see you.
- Hey.

262
00:19:03,474 --> 00:19:05,237
Is this the plan?

263
00:19:14,685 --> 00:19:18,951
Ian, dude, there's like 80 wet chicks here.
Get off your wallflower ass.

264
00:19:19,023 --> 00:19:21,992
- Are you smoking cigars now?
- Yes.

265
00:19:22,059 --> 00:19:25,324
- Hey, Lance. Tight party.
- Okay, rude.

266
00:19:25,396 --> 00:19:27,227
You can see
I'm having a conversation here.

267
00:19:27,298 --> 00:19:30,233
Now, I'll be with you
in a few minutes, okay?

268
00:19:30,301 --> 00:19:31,632
- Thank you.
- We're sorry.

269
00:19:31,702 --> 00:19:33,670
- Don't apologize to her.
- I'm sorry.

270
00:19:33,738 --> 00:19:35,433
Don't apologize to me.

271
00:19:40,244 --> 00:19:41,768
Hey, I'm gonna go see
who Felicia's talking to.

272
00:19:41,846 --> 00:19:44,076
No, dude, forget Felicia, okay?

273
00:19:44,148 --> 00:19:46,173
I know you guys are BFF and all that shit,

274
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,616
but tonight's about getting that dick
a little daylight.

275
00:19:48,686 --> 00:19:50,711
Hey, Lindsay, sweetheart,
where you going?

276
00:19:50,788 --> 00:19:53,256
Come here, we're not done. Get in here.

277
00:19:53,324 --> 00:19:57,158
- You know my boy Ian?
- Yeah. No. I don't know.

278
00:19:57,228 --> 00:20:01,130
- You used to be on my paper route.
- Okay, sure. My mom likes you.

279
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:07,627
Fucking A your mom likes Ian. Look at him.
He's a big, bright crimson king. Right?

280
00:20:07,705 --> 00:20:09,900
You know what else?

281
00:20:09,974 --> 00:20:12,101
Ian is a bust-ass virgin.

282
00:20:14,745 --> 00:20:16,110
I'm so sorry.

283
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:19,411
Don't let that deter you from fucking him.

284
00:20:25,122 --> 00:20:28,353
Yeah. No, I'm pretty stoked.
I got into the University of Wisconsin,

285
00:20:28,426 --> 00:20:30,656
and I'm gonna go for veterinary medicine,
'cause that's where...

286
00:20:30,728 --> 00:20:33,162
- Are you gonna go to college?
- University of Boulder.

287
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:34,926
It's a great party school.

288
00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:40,369
You know, I read that they have
a really great astronomy program.

289
00:20:40,438 --> 00:20:42,372
I don't know if that's
what you're going there for or...

290
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:48,106
Because it's really high elevation,
and you can see the stars really well...

291
00:20:50,982 --> 00:20:52,244
Planets.

292
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:56,342
Wow! A little tip action there.
That's really suggestive.

293
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,651
I'm not saying that
you're gonna do that on my, well...

294
00:20:59,757 --> 00:21:02,988
You can just stick with my finger
if you want 'cause this feels great, so...

295
00:21:04,362 --> 00:21:09,425
You're really good at that.
That's really wet. Two...

296
00:21:12,436 --> 00:21:14,904
Ian! Dude!
- I'm... Could you excuse me for a second?

297
00:21:14,972 --> 00:21:16,963
Hello. Hello?

298
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:20,408
- Hey!
- Hey! What up?

299
00:21:20,478 --> 00:21:24,244
- What are you doing in there, man?
- What're you doing out here, man?

300
00:21:24,315 --> 00:21:27,148
- I asked you first.
- Nothing.

301
00:21:27,218 --> 00:21:30,984
No, I just... I spilled beer on my shirt,
so then I had to...

302
00:21:31,055 --> 00:21:35,992
- I thought you had, like, a girl in there.
- Yeah, right. I wish.

303
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:39,587
So, okay.
So, are your parents, like, still going

304
00:21:39,664 --> 00:21:41,723
to Dylan's motor-cross thing this weekend?

305
00:21:41,832 --> 00:21:43,459
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
They all take off in the morning.

306
00:21:43,534 --> 00:21:44,796
Okay. Awesome.

307
00:21:44,869 --> 00:21:49,897
'Cause my evil cousin is driving me nuts,
so, I don't know,

308
00:21:49,974 --> 00:21:53,137
you think, like, maybe I could hang
at your place this weekend?

309
00:21:53,244 --> 00:21:55,906
Yeah. Yeah, like a sleepover or something.
It'll be fun.

310
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:02,283
Oh, my God! Thank you so much.
Hey, I have a secret.

311
00:22:03,688 --> 00:22:06,555
- Okay.
- But it's like a girl secret, so...

312
00:22:06,624 --> 00:22:11,357
- Can you handle it? Are you sure? Okay.
- Yeah.

313
00:22:11,462 --> 00:22:14,226
Hey, Dibits, fuck off.

314
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,901
Okay, so I... Oh my God, this is so lame.

315
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:24,430
- Look at you acting like such a girl.
- I know, I know. Okay, okay. Here it is.

316
00:22:26,277 --> 00:22:30,714
I have a crush on someone, a boy, a guy.

317
00:22:31,315 --> 00:22:33,909
Yeah? Well, who is it?

318
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,782
Come on, you know me better than anyone.
I bet you know who it is.

319
00:22:36,854 --> 00:22:38,412
Come on, guess.

320
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:41,447
Um...

321
00:22:42,259 --> 00:22:43,817
I think I know.

322
00:22:52,103 --> 00:22:57,905
I'm kidding. Oh, God! I got you.
You're so easy. You're so easy!

323
00:23:01,912 --> 00:23:05,006
- You're my best friend.
- I know, and you're my best friend.

324
00:23:05,082 --> 00:23:09,041
That's why it's funny that we would kiss,
because we wouldn't.

325
00:23:11,222 --> 00:23:15,283
So who is it? Who's the lucky <i>caballero?</i>

326
00:23:15,826 --> 00:23:18,056
Um... Nobody.

327
00:23:18,129 --> 00:23:21,963
- Nobody?
- I... I was kidding, too.

328
00:23:22,933 --> 00:23:25,026
- That is funny.
- It's hilarious.

329
00:23:25,102 --> 00:23:27,468
- That is so funny.
- That is so funny.

330
00:23:28,239 --> 00:23:30,002
Oh! I...

331
00:23:30,074 --> 00:23:31,063
- You got...
- Yeah.

332
00:23:31,142 --> 00:23:33,667
- All right. So...
- Hey!

333
00:23:33,744 --> 00:23:35,109
Okay.

334
00:23:41,018 --> 00:23:42,178
Harsh.

335
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,357
Well, come on, Ian.

336
00:23:56,567 --> 00:23:58,762
You know what? I'm good. I'm just gonna...

337
00:23:58,836 --> 00:24:01,669
Ian, come on, baby. Don't be shy.

338
00:24:01,739 --> 00:24:05,766
No, thanks. It looks like
you got your hands full there, so...

339
00:24:05,843 --> 00:24:08,038
Sure you don't want to
get in on this, bro?

340
00:24:08,112 --> 00:24:10,171
No, thanks, man.

341
00:24:10,247 --> 00:24:13,648
It looks like you fellows
got it all under control.

342
00:24:13,717 --> 00:24:17,710
So I'm just gonna skedaddle.
You all take care now.

343
00:24:17,788 --> 00:24:19,346
Lindsay, say hi to your mom.

344
00:24:20,524 --> 00:24:22,014
All right. See you later, buddy.

345
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:31,961
Ian. Dude, where you going?

346
00:24:34,205 --> 00:24:35,297
Shit.

347
00:24:43,714 --> 00:24:45,705
Hey, Goldie, scoot over.

348
00:24:52,456 --> 00:24:55,653
- Hey, babe, you wanna party?
- I'm at a party.

349
00:24:55,726 --> 00:24:57,853
You should pee on us.

350
00:24:57,928 --> 00:24:58,986
Why don't you take a picture, Ian?

351
00:24:59,063 --> 00:25:01,793
Yeah, and post it on
Totalfuckingawesomeness. com.

352
00:25:01,866 --> 00:25:03,891
Backslash-we-rule!

353
00:25:03,968 --> 00:25:05,128
Where'd you come up with that?

354
00:25:05,202 --> 00:25:10,299
- Hey, can I ask you guys a question?
- You just did.

355
00:25:11,141 --> 00:25:13,166
- Can I ask you another question?
- You just did again.

356
00:25:13,244 --> 00:25:15,439
- What's up? What's up?
- What's up, what's up?

357
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:18,778
Nice hair. It'll look even better in my crotch.

358
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,752
- Dude, where you going?
- Come on.

359
00:25:24,855 --> 00:25:27,824
What's going on?
Something troubling you? Be a buddy.

360
00:25:27,892 --> 00:25:32,989
- I'm... All right, all right.
- You got to get over the monkey.

361
00:25:33,063 --> 00:25:37,227
Where do you guys get the confidence to,
like, hit on every girl you see?

362
00:25:37,301 --> 00:25:41,135
- 'Cause we're the shit.
- Yeah, you oughts to know that, bitch.

363
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:47,609
- So where's Felicia?
- Fel-ate-cha. Yeah.

364
00:25:48,579 --> 00:25:51,946
- She's in...
- Fe-lay-cha! You banging her?

365
00:25:52,783 --> 00:25:54,375
We're just friends.

366
00:25:54,451 --> 00:25:56,214
- I'm uncircumcised.
- Yeah.

367
00:25:56,387 --> 00:25:58,582
- I'm into you and I'm hard.
- Yeah.

368
00:25:58,656 --> 00:26:01,056
- Hey, I was born to fertilize.
- Yeah.

369
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:03,286
- I'm a firefighter.
- Fuck off!

370
00:26:04,728 --> 00:26:06,525
Wait, I thought you took her to prom.

371
00:26:06,597 --> 00:26:09,566
Yeah,
but it was a just-friends kind of thing.

372
00:26:13,904 --> 00:26:16,065
You should bang her. We would.

373
00:26:16,206 --> 00:26:17,798
Dude, we would bang her so hard.

374
00:26:17,975 --> 00:26:20,341
We would take that ass and just...

375
00:26:23,213 --> 00:26:25,374
Yeah, tell her we'll bang her for you
if you're not into it.

376
00:26:25,449 --> 00:26:26,814
Yeah. Hard.

377
00:26:26,884 --> 00:26:29,114
- With our dicks!
- Yeah, our dicks are huge.

378
00:26:29,186 --> 00:26:32,314
You could see them from space!
What's up?

379
00:26:32,389 --> 00:26:35,358
- What's up?
- Hey, do you have a phone number?

380
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,052
You don't. Okay.

381
00:26:44,268 --> 00:26:46,065
I'll call you from nationals.

382
00:26:49,406 --> 00:26:51,931
Say it.
- You're my little donut girl.

383
00:26:56,113 --> 00:26:59,776
- Bye, sexy.
- Yo, Ian.

384
00:27:00,918 --> 00:27:04,752
- You want to smell my finger?
- Yeah, okay.

385
00:27:09,259 --> 00:27:11,750
Are you sure you got the right hole?

386
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:20,796
Kids.

387
00:27:27,845 --> 00:27:29,107
Awesome.

388
00:27:34,852 --> 00:27:37,150
Hmm... '69.

389
00:27:44,628 --> 00:27:45,720
Whoa.

390
00:27:54,505 --> 00:27:56,473
Don't puss out. Be cool.

391
00:27:59,243 --> 00:28:01,677
I don't know.

392
00:28:02,012 --> 00:28:07,917
That is a long drive, my sugar biscuit!

393
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,089
Sugar biscuit? God, I suck at this.

394
00:28:25,135 --> 00:28:26,602
Holy buckets.

395
00:28:28,806 --> 00:28:31,104
She wants me to give her the D.

396
00:28:32,242 --> 00:28:33,266
<i> Well, honey</i>

397
00:28:33,343 --> 00:28:34,332
<i>What ya got, Mr. Mans?</i>

398
00:28:34,411 --> 00:28:35,844
<i>I got a lot of money</i>

399
00:28:35,913 --> 00:28:37,847
<i>I don't see no keys in my hands</i>

400
00:28:37,915 --> 00:28:40,782
<i>I just wanna nasty girl</i>

401
00:28:42,186 --> 00:28:44,552
<i>Now tell me, is that nasty girl you?</i>

402
00:28:44,621 --> 00:28:45,815
<i>Do you like what you see?</i>

403
00:28:45,889 --> 00:28:52,453
<i>Could you be my nasty girl</i>
<i>and let me do that dirty dance with you?</i>

404
00:28:52,529 --> 00:28:54,622
<i>I can love you long time</i>

405
00:29:08,412 --> 00:29:11,711
<i> I like 'em all in shapes and sizes</i>

406
00:29:12,349 --> 00:29:14,977
<i>And it don't make no difference to me</i>

407
00:29:15,886 --> 00:29:20,346
<i>If you're short, tall, big or small</i>
<i>Long if there ain't no big surprises</i>

408
00:29:20,424 --> 00:29:22,654
<i>Chances are you'll suit me to a T

409
00:29:31,401 --> 00:29:32,732
Love beef.

410
00:29:36,573 --> 00:29:38,234
Terry, phone call.

411
00:29:42,246 --> 00:29:45,545
Dude, weren't you in my gym class?
What is it? Egan?

412
00:29:45,616 --> 00:29:47,607
Yeah, yeah. Hey, Jordan.

413
00:29:52,656 --> 00:29:56,752
Right. Whatever, scrotch.
You can't get your fist pregnant.

414
00:29:56,827 --> 00:30:00,490
Russ, man, check it out.
Yo, look who's buying jimmys.

415
00:30:01,431 --> 00:30:03,922
You want these gift-wrapped, Egan?

416
00:30:08,572 --> 00:30:10,164
Just ring it up, man.

417
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,606
Karen, let me have that for you.

418
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:15,970
Dad, what did you do with my helmet?

419
00:30:35,332 --> 00:30:42,261
Ian, honey,
I made you some tollhouse cookies.

420
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,574
I'll just leave these here for you.

421
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:48,175
I'll get them later.

422
00:30:48,846 --> 00:30:51,815
There's $40 in the cow for fun money,

423
00:30:52,482 --> 00:30:55,883
so be safe and sorry I didn't knock.

424
00:30:57,354 --> 00:31:01,154
Anytime. It's your home now.

425
00:31:02,326 --> 00:31:03,850
Oh, dear.

426
00:31:07,631 --> 00:31:09,258
- Dude.
- Hey.

427
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:12,359
What is going on with you?
You bought rubbers?

428
00:31:13,103 --> 00:31:15,571
- How did you know that?
- It's on Russ Miller's blog.

429
00:31:19,676 --> 00:31:21,803
Jesus! That was, like, 11 minutes ago.

430
00:31:21,879 --> 00:31:23,312
What's the deal? Dude.

431
00:31:24,815 --> 00:31:27,784
She wants me to meet her tonight
at the Big Boy in Knoxville.

432
00:31:27,918 --> 00:31:31,820
This is a fucking written invitation
to your dick from the Internet.

433
00:31:31,889 --> 00:31:33,151
Oh, Jesus.

434
00:31:33,223 --> 00:31:35,521
Seriously, dude, pack your shit.
We're going to Knoxville.

435
00:31:35,592 --> 00:31:37,651
No. Stop it. Put these back.

436
00:31:37,761 --> 00:31:39,524
This is the type of girl who has...

437
00:31:39,596 --> 00:31:42,224
She has it shaved into a landing strip.

438
00:31:42,633 --> 00:31:44,032
I can't deal with a landing strip.

439
00:31:44,101 --> 00:31:46,763
Okay, dude, you don't know that. I mean,
she could have anything under there.

440
00:31:46,837 --> 00:31:51,399
There could be a little Hitler
or just a full, nasty Chewbacca.

441
00:31:52,943 --> 00:31:56,106
But I'm guessing this chick is baby fresh.

442
00:31:56,179 --> 00:32:00,047
You know, she doesn't even want me.
She wants him.

443
00:32:01,218 --> 00:32:04,984
I'm sorry. This is good. This is fine.

444
00:32:05,055 --> 00:32:07,148
I mean, that looks like you. Like the eyes.

445
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:09,949
Tasty's probably a guy, anyway.

446
00:32:10,027 --> 00:32:12,723
Maybe. But what if she's not?

447
00:32:13,196 --> 00:32:16,688
You know, I mean, look, you've already
opened, and I could help you close.

448
00:32:17,234 --> 00:32:18,633
We just need one thing.

449
00:32:24,141 --> 00:32:28,771
Ian, just look at this.
I mean, you roll up in a '69 GTO,

450
00:32:28,845 --> 00:32:31,473
she's gonna drop an egg right there
in the Big Boy parking lot.

451
00:32:31,548 --> 00:32:33,516
Hey, Ian, come give me a hand with this.

452
00:32:34,584 --> 00:32:37,678
Here. Strap that end down. Tight.

453
00:32:38,288 --> 00:32:41,485
- The cord's too short.
- Put a little sack into it, powder puff.

454
00:32:45,395 --> 00:32:47,795
- All right. Thanks, little brother.
- Yeah.

455
00:32:48,198 --> 00:32:49,859
- Hey, Ian.
- Yeah.

456
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,427
Did I hear something
about you wanting to borrow my car?

457
00:32:52,502 --> 00:32:55,164
No, no, it's fine. Thanks. Thank you.

458
00:32:56,206 --> 00:32:57,468
You sure?

459
00:32:58,842 --> 00:33:02,300
You're my little brother, Ian.
All you gotta do is ask.

460
00:33:04,348 --> 00:33:05,440
Okay.

461
00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:09,074
Could I use The Judge this weekend?

462
00:33:14,024 --> 00:33:18,688
Fuck-stick, I wouldn't let you drive
The Judge if it was parked on my shnuts.

463
00:33:22,299 --> 00:33:24,529
Let's go, Dad.
- What a dick.

464
00:33:24,601 --> 00:33:26,432
You should take his car just on principle.

465
00:33:26,837 --> 00:33:28,771
What do you want me to do, you know?

466
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:31,399
I mean, I doubt I can hot-wire it,
since I don't even know what that means.

467
00:33:31,475 --> 00:33:32,942
What are you doing?

468
00:33:36,847 --> 00:33:39,873
No. Lance, no! Put it back.
Did you just hear him? Please.

469
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:42,111
Come here, we're gonna have a talk.

470
00:33:42,452 --> 00:33:44,647
She's only nine short hours away, okay?

471
00:33:44,721 --> 00:33:47,588
We're gonna head down there tonight
and you're gonna put a dent in that shit.

472
00:33:47,657 --> 00:33:50,626
Ian's gonna treat it like it's meat
that needs tenderizing.

473
00:33:50,694 --> 00:33:52,389
With his dick instead of a hammer.

474
00:33:52,462 --> 00:33:54,589
You can pound it till it bleeds.

475
00:33:54,664 --> 00:33:58,293
Yeah, it's just a fucking girl's mess,
and then we're gonna be...

476
00:33:59,469 --> 00:34:02,131
- What're you doing?
- Still rolling.

477
00:34:02,205 --> 00:34:04,969
Who's gonna pound on it? Say it.
Ian's gonna pound on it.

478
00:34:05,042 --> 00:34:07,738
We're back tomorrow
before Rex even knows the car is gone.

479
00:34:07,811 --> 00:34:09,870
Now, listen, these girls at Madison are
gonna be fucking at a college level.

480
00:34:11,048 --> 00:34:13,073
I need you ready for that.

481
00:34:13,417 --> 00:34:15,408
Wait! Put it... Put it back.

482
00:34:16,186 --> 00:34:17,278
Back here.

483
00:34:33,904 --> 00:34:37,431
For God's sake. You two rump rangers
couldn't wait five minutes?

484
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,316
Shit.

485
00:35:10,874 --> 00:35:12,432
- Shit!
- Fuck!

486
00:35:12,509 --> 00:35:15,034
I told her she could stay here this weekend.

487
00:35:15,545 --> 00:35:19,072
Dude, what the hell?
Why are you driving Rex's car?

488
00:35:19,149 --> 00:35:20,946
I thought me and...

489
00:35:22,686 --> 00:35:25,348
- Are you bitching out on me?
- No.

490
00:35:25,422 --> 00:35:26,616
- No.
- No.

491
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:29,420
Good. Well, then where are we going?

492
00:35:30,427 --> 00:35:32,987
Um... Knoxville, Tennessee.

493
00:35:34,131 --> 00:35:35,564
Okay. I'm gonna go tell my mom.

494
00:35:35,632 --> 00:35:39,466
Okay. Are you gonna... Awesome.

495
00:35:39,669 --> 00:35:41,159
Dude, what the fuck?

496
00:35:41,238 --> 00:35:43,069
- I don't want her along.
- Really?

497
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,301
You don't want to bring Yoko
on your sex trip?

498
00:35:45,375 --> 00:35:47,707
Yeah, no shit.
She's always cock-blocking you.

499
00:35:47,777 --> 00:35:50,337
No, she isn't. She doesn't even have a...

500
00:35:50,413 --> 00:35:52,608
Okay, twat blocking.

501
00:35:52,682 --> 00:35:53,774
Professor.

502
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:54,874
When will you
be coming back?

503
00:35:54,951 --> 00:35:56,282
No, tomorrow.

504
00:35:56,353 --> 00:35:59,413
When?
- No. Bye! God.

505
00:35:59,489 --> 00:36:01,821
You guys
drive safe now. Bye!

506
00:36:02,392 --> 00:36:04,087
So, what's in Tennessee?

507
00:36:04,761 --> 00:36:07,525
My grandma has got some cancer.

508
00:36:08,331 --> 00:36:10,162
- Grammy K?
- She's fine.

509
00:36:10,467 --> 00:36:13,527
She's gonna live forever. Well, a long time.

510
00:36:14,804 --> 00:36:16,635
It's, you know... I mean, what is it called?

511
00:36:16,706 --> 00:36:18,765
- It's foot cancer.
- She's got a little foot cancer.

512
00:36:18,842 --> 00:36:21,037
She'll be hopping around in no time.

513
00:36:21,878 --> 00:36:24,278
So what's she doing in Tennessee?

514
00:36:24,548 --> 00:36:28,644
Oh! Um... Well, there's this kick-ass
cancer center there.

515
00:36:28,718 --> 00:36:32,518
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's like... It's famous.

516
00:36:32,756 --> 00:36:35,384
- Yeah.
- So if you ever get any cancer,

517
00:36:35,458 --> 00:36:39,690
you should totally check it out.

518
00:36:41,097 --> 00:36:42,223
I would.

519
00:36:45,235 --> 00:36:49,535
So you want I-80 East and then
65 goes all the way through Indiana.

520
00:36:50,607 --> 00:36:52,507
- So how's it feel?
- What?

521
00:36:53,076 --> 00:36:56,978
I don't know, breaking the rules,
talking some shit, driving The Judge?

522
00:36:58,215 --> 00:36:59,739
It feels pretty good.

523
00:36:59,816 --> 00:37:02,114
<i> I'm feeling rough, I'm feeling raw</i>

524
00:37:02,185 --> 00:37:04,278
<i>I'm in the prime of my life</i>

525
00:37:08,625 --> 00:37:14,257
<i>Let's make some music, make some money</i>
<i>Find some models for wives</i>

526
00:37:18,101 --> 00:37:22,401
<i>This is our decision</i>
<i>To live fast and die young</i>

527
00:37:22,939 --> 00:37:28,070
<i>We've got the vision</i>
<i>Now let's have some fun</i>

528
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:33,008
<i>I said, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

529
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,581
This dude wants to race.

530
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:41,621
Let's go, ladies.

531
00:37:41,691 --> 00:37:44,387
Lance! Cut it out!
Come on, you don't know who's in there.

532
00:37:44,461 --> 00:37:48,591
Dude, I don't care if fucking Steve
McQueen's zombie corpse is in that car.

533
00:37:48,665 --> 00:37:51,657
I refuse to be embarrassed by a car
that looks like a Trapper Keeper.

534
00:37:51,735 --> 00:37:53,862
I am not racing in my brother's car.

535
00:37:54,871 --> 00:37:56,930
Holy shit.

536
00:37:57,974 --> 00:37:59,635
What the hell is that?

537
00:38:01,878 --> 00:38:03,937
Looks like a Nachos BellGrande.

538
00:38:04,014 --> 00:38:05,481
And a chalupa!

539
00:38:05,782 --> 00:38:07,147
Medium Coke!

540
00:38:08,518 --> 00:38:09,542
Go right!

541
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:11,812
Turn the wipers on!
- They are on.

542
00:38:12,022 --> 00:38:13,512
They're not working!

543
00:38:13,723 --> 00:38:16,556
Please, don't yell at me.
I'm doing the best I can.

544
00:38:17,527 --> 00:38:18,960
- Winnebago!
- Where?

545
00:38:19,029 --> 00:38:20,860
Winnebago! Winnebago!

546
00:38:28,405 --> 00:38:30,498
Oh, my God, are you all right?

547
00:38:35,445 --> 00:38:38,846
Yeah, nobody offer to help.
I got this under control.

548
00:38:46,222 --> 00:38:50,386
- Are you all right?
- Do I look like I'm all right? Fuck!

549
00:38:52,696 --> 00:38:57,565
You know what might make you feel better?
Putting 40 on pump two.

550
00:39:12,782 --> 00:39:16,616
Hey. You okay in there?

551
00:39:18,822 --> 00:39:22,781
God damn! My back teeth are snorkeling.

552
00:39:28,598 --> 00:39:30,088
Sweet relief.

553
00:39:33,069 --> 00:39:35,128
You got the shy bladder?

554
00:39:36,106 --> 00:39:37,437
- Yeah.
- Damn.

555
00:39:39,909 --> 00:39:43,140
Paruresis. That's what they call it.

556
00:39:43,213 --> 00:39:46,011
Let me tell you something.
I didn't catch your name.

557
00:39:46,082 --> 00:39:47,344
It's Ian.

558
00:39:47,417 --> 00:39:51,911
Let me tell you something, Ian.
I had it something fierce.

559
00:39:55,492 --> 00:39:58,893
You can do it, Ian. You can do it.

560
00:40:05,201 --> 00:40:07,692
Go running down by your sister.

561
00:40:07,771 --> 00:40:10,865
Excuse me, ma'am, that was my pump.

562
00:40:11,274 --> 00:40:14,937
Yeah? You move your meat,
you lose your seat. Hmm.

563
00:40:16,279 --> 00:40:19,737
Logan, do not eat that.
You will fuck up your appetite!

564
00:40:21,117 --> 00:40:22,209
Damn.

565
00:40:23,319 --> 00:40:25,480
Listen, Reba.

566
00:40:25,555 --> 00:40:30,083
If you value the rest of your teeth,
you will shut off that pump.

567
00:40:35,498 --> 00:40:38,899
So I tells my daddy, "You know what?
You're not the boss of me.

568
00:40:38,968 --> 00:40:42,563
"Not you, not Angie,"
that's that girl I was telling you about.

569
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:44,698
"And sure as hell not this bladder of mine."

570
00:40:44,774 --> 00:40:46,867
Well, he looked at me,
and you should have...

571
00:40:46,943 --> 00:40:50,709
Ian. Where you going? Don't give up.

572
00:40:53,616 --> 00:40:56,551
Jesus. I've been pissing for an hour.

573
00:41:01,057 --> 00:41:05,050
- Another one for the collection.
- Cool. Thanks.

574
00:41:07,797 --> 00:41:08,889
What?

575
00:41:14,404 --> 00:41:17,601
It's okay, Brandy. It's okay, baby, don't cry.

576
00:41:17,674 --> 00:41:19,369
Lance, what are you doing?

577
00:41:19,442 --> 00:41:21,376
Dude, you should be ashamed of yourself,

578
00:41:21,444 --> 00:41:25,380
because I'm just trying to show
another human being a little compassion.

579
00:41:25,982 --> 00:41:27,381
And my dick.

580
00:41:29,886 --> 00:41:32,946
It's okay, baby. Just let those tears fall.

581
00:41:33,022 --> 00:41:35,422
You know why?
'Cause our love will dry them up.

582
00:41:35,492 --> 00:41:39,189
Love will keep us alive. Just like that song.
You know that song?

583
00:41:39,262 --> 00:41:43,392
That's our song now.
That song represents our bond.

584
00:41:45,168 --> 00:41:47,830
Don Henley's words represent our love.

585
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:55,834
What have you got?

586
00:41:56,212 --> 00:41:58,646
Hey, kid, where you from?

587
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:04,850
- I'm from Chicago, I mean, outside Chicago.
- Are you two married. No?

588
00:42:06,289 --> 00:42:12,125
- No, we're just friends. We're <i>amigos.</i>
- You make a good couple.

589
00:42:12,695 --> 00:42:15,391
She's pretty. Marry that girl.

590
00:42:15,498 --> 00:42:19,059
See my lady and I here,
we've been married forever.

591
00:42:19,135 --> 00:42:21,535
And I tell you she was gorgeous.

592
00:42:21,604 --> 00:42:25,040
The first day I saw her,
I said, "This is gonna be my wife."

593
00:42:25,108 --> 00:42:27,668
And you know what? It happened.

594
00:42:27,744 --> 00:42:31,407
I tell you,
that was a very good year for corn.

595
00:42:31,481 --> 00:42:33,847
Made lots of money.

596
00:42:33,917 --> 00:42:39,685
I fixed my 4X4 and bought my lady
a sexy French lingerie.

597
00:42:39,756 --> 00:42:42,884
Boy, those were the best six bucks
I ever spent.

598
00:42:45,161 --> 00:42:48,358
You kids want to help yourself
to a can of Purple?

599
00:42:48,765 --> 00:42:52,724
- Purple sounds great, Ian. Purple?
- Yeah, I can go...

600
00:42:55,371 --> 00:42:57,532
Say, the boys still hanging?

601
00:42:58,508 --> 00:43:02,000
- You ever had a peppermint fatty?
- No. Let's have that.

602
00:43:02,145 --> 00:43:04,045
See how that shoe fits.

603
00:43:07,483 --> 00:43:10,213
Oh my God. Do you have a degree in this?

604
00:43:12,522 --> 00:43:15,787
You know that thing,
when runners say they break the wall?

605
00:43:15,858 --> 00:43:18,520
You know, and it's all good after that?

606
00:43:18,962 --> 00:43:20,827
I feel like that
when my dick's in your mouth.

607
00:43:21,864 --> 00:43:24,298
It actually says Purple Soda.

608
00:43:29,138 --> 00:43:31,106
Bad boy.

609
00:43:35,845 --> 00:43:37,870
You like him, don't you?

610
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:45,319
- What? Who?
- Lance. I mean, he's the crush, right?

611
00:43:45,455 --> 00:43:50,256
Oh, yeah! I like Lance, 'cause he's so hot.

612
00:43:50,326 --> 00:43:54,194
I wanna have his baby, he's... Whatever.

613
00:43:57,967 --> 00:44:01,027
Brandy!
- Uh-oh!

614
00:44:01,104 --> 00:44:04,130
Brandy! Shit.

615
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:08,944
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

616
00:44:09,012 --> 00:44:13,881
Mr. McBroom. Ma'am.
Where the fuck's Brandy at?

617
00:44:22,959 --> 00:44:28,556
- You ever hear of a rolling brown-out?
- No. Let's try it.

618
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:31,860
You bleach that.

619
00:44:32,402 --> 00:44:36,600
Wait. No, no, no, no! Nothing brown!
Nothing brown! Nothing brown!

620
00:44:36,673 --> 00:44:39,073
What're you gonna do? Hit a girl?

621
00:44:39,342 --> 00:44:43,506
No, but I'm gonna
pummel his ass real good.

622
00:44:43,579 --> 00:44:45,945
There you go. There you go.

623
00:44:47,016 --> 00:44:48,005
Hey!

624
00:44:48,151 --> 00:44:49,482
I have to go to church.

625
00:44:50,353 --> 00:44:53,288
Come on, baby! Open the goddamn door!

626
00:44:59,195 --> 00:45:03,256
All right, this is not what it looks like.
It was a project for school.

627
00:45:03,332 --> 00:45:04,492
Purple Soda!

628
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:14,904
Wiener!

629
00:45:18,848 --> 00:45:19,837
Ow!

630
00:45:42,171 --> 00:45:43,661
There you are.

631
00:45:45,908 --> 00:45:48,843
Come on, come on.
I do not want to die naked.

632
00:45:55,218 --> 00:45:59,484
Fuck you! Motherfucking son of a bitch!

633
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:11,025
Get on your feet, you motherfucking pussy!

634
00:46:11,234 --> 00:46:15,295
I'm gonna ask you this just one time.
Did she give you the nugget?

635
00:46:15,705 --> 00:46:17,172
Hey, hold on!

636
00:46:18,841 --> 00:46:20,069
Come on, man, she's not worth it.

637
00:46:20,143 --> 00:46:22,839
She's just gonna shit all over you.
Trust me.

638
00:46:23,246 --> 00:46:26,272
- She touch your butthole?
- No, no. Jesus, no!

639
00:46:26,349 --> 00:46:28,977
- Let's see!
- I thought she was a man. I'm gay.

640
00:46:29,051 --> 00:46:30,643
I'm gay as hell.

641
00:46:33,122 --> 00:46:35,590
Eat bat, dickhead!

642
00:46:37,193 --> 00:46:38,626
Holy shit!

643
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:41,890
Ian just killed that guy.

644
00:46:41,964 --> 00:46:44,091
Sir? Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
Are you all right?

645
00:46:44,167 --> 00:46:47,500
Look, I have my insurance card.
I'm sorry. We're from out of town.

646
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:51,062
I couldn't see you through the corn.
I'm sorry.

647
00:46:54,644 --> 00:46:56,874
Where the hell's the road?
- It feels like left.

648
00:46:56,946 --> 00:46:58,106
I told you we didn't have time for this,

649
00:46:58,181 --> 00:47:00,445
- but all you care about is your stupid dick.
- Ian.

650
00:47:00,516 --> 00:47:02,177
And you leave us out there
with her mom's weird soda.

651
00:47:02,251 --> 00:47:04,651
- Ian.
- And her dad's balls in plain view...

652
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:05,846
Ian, Ian, whip a shitty!

653
00:47:05,922 --> 00:47:07,219
Motherfucker!

654
00:47:18,034 --> 00:47:21,231
Holy fucking shit! That's how you do that!

655
00:47:21,404 --> 00:47:25,204
Oh, my God, Ian, amazing driving.
Lance, you suck!

656
00:47:25,474 --> 00:47:27,772
Where the hell are we?
- Where are the Google maps?

657
00:47:27,844 --> 00:47:30,278
- They're in my pants.
- Which are?

658
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:32,777
In the trailer.

659
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:36,611
Mmm-hmm. Great.

660
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:41,586
Shit. I got gum in my bush.

661
00:47:45,428 --> 00:47:47,794
Hey, pick this guy up. Maybe he can
show us back to the highway.

662
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:51,425
- Ian, do not pick up a hitchhiker.
- Don't worry, I won't.

663
00:47:53,069 --> 00:47:54,866
No, no, no.

664
00:47:56,138 --> 00:47:58,038
Oh, my God.

665
00:48:00,276 --> 00:48:04,269
Hey! Thanks for the lift, man.
I've been out there for hours.

666
00:48:04,714 --> 00:48:06,409
Not one car. Can you believe it?

667
00:48:06,482 --> 00:48:09,110
- Listen, sir, we didn't...
- You're good people.

668
00:48:09,185 --> 00:48:12,643
- Guy, you're not wearing any pants.
- Yeah, I know.

669
00:48:13,089 --> 00:48:14,113
Right on.

670
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:16,090
Let's go. We better go.

671
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:19,525
Hey, you got my stuff.

672
00:48:21,998 --> 00:48:25,900
Hey, real quick, guys,
what's the story of the girl?

673
00:48:25,968 --> 00:48:29,961
- I'm 25 years old.
- I don't know what he's talking about.

674
00:48:39,615 --> 00:48:44,177
I got nothing. There's no bars.
You know, it probably just needs water.

675
00:48:44,487 --> 00:48:46,011
Got any in the trunk?

676
00:48:46,222 --> 00:48:48,816
Hey, sweetheart, men are talking.
We got this one.

677
00:48:48,891 --> 00:48:51,860
Yeah, thanks,
but this happened to my brother's car once

678
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:54,726
- and you just piss in the radiator.
- Really?

679
00:48:54,964 --> 00:48:56,556
Yeah.

680
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,827
Oh, God! Damn it!

681
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:03,238
- Are you okay?
- Fuck. Yeah.

682
00:49:03,306 --> 00:49:05,001
That's a lesson learned.

683
00:49:07,643 --> 00:49:09,508
You can watch,
if you're into that kind of thing.

684
00:49:09,578 --> 00:49:13,014
Wow, thanks, but I think we've all seen
your dick enough for one day.

685
00:49:13,082 --> 00:49:17,917
Do you hear that? There's a ringing.
- Your loss. It's like razor blades.

686
00:49:17,987 --> 00:49:22,788
What? There's ants down here. FYI.

687
00:49:22,858 --> 00:49:27,625
All right, you're up. Grip it and rip it.

688
00:49:28,364 --> 00:49:31,629
Okay. Go away.

689
00:49:32,034 --> 00:49:36,164
Dude, seriously? Still?
I thought you got over this shit.

690
00:49:37,707 --> 00:49:39,174
You're a grown man.

691
00:49:46,549 --> 00:49:50,041
Flowing river, gentle stream.
Flowing river, gentle stream.

692
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:54,579
- Yo, stage fright, how're we doing?
- Damn it, Lance, just give me a minute.

693
00:49:55,992 --> 00:50:00,486
Excuse me.
We kind of need you to pee in the radiator.

694
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:04,158
- Why?
- We just do.

695
00:50:05,501 --> 00:50:09,028
I'm sorry. I just took a squirt
a couple of minutes ago.

696
00:50:10,106 --> 00:50:12,097
You want me to shit in it?

697
00:50:13,209 --> 00:50:15,541
- We'll get back to you on that one.
- All right.

698
00:50:17,713 --> 00:50:20,307
- I'm telling you, I could shit right now.
- Awesome.

699
00:50:22,251 --> 00:50:25,243
Our new friend's got nothing left
in the tank.

700
00:50:29,792 --> 00:50:30,952
What?

701
00:50:34,563 --> 00:50:39,227
No. Guys, come on.
I don't have the aim that you do.

702
00:50:39,301 --> 00:50:43,032
Every drop helps so much.

703
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:48,240
Hey, look what I found in my bag.

704
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:49,641
Thank God.

705
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:53,344
- No!
- What the fuck are you doing?

706
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:01,078
You all just wait 20 minutes
and I'll top it off for you.

707
00:51:03,726 --> 00:51:05,284
Could be ten.

708
00:51:05,361 --> 00:51:09,127
Fine, fine. Okay.
But if any of you pervs peek,

709
00:51:09,198 --> 00:51:12,429
I swear to God it will be
your last conscious act.

710
00:51:20,376 --> 00:51:21,502
Shit.

711
00:51:36,158 --> 00:51:38,126
You kids need some help?

712
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,024
Hi.

713
00:51:52,241 --> 00:51:53,435
Are you okay?

714
00:51:53,509 --> 00:51:56,637
Yeah, I'm great.
I just beaved a family of four.

715
00:51:57,813 --> 00:51:59,007
Try it.

716
00:52:04,487 --> 00:52:05,647
All set?

717
00:52:05,721 --> 00:52:08,554
Look, I'm sorry, sir,
but we can't give you a ride.

718
00:52:10,659 --> 00:52:12,752
I'm gonna say this once.

719
00:52:12,828 --> 00:52:16,821
You unlock this fucking car,
or God is my witness,

720
00:52:17,366 --> 00:52:19,527
I'll stake you all to the ground,

721
00:52:19,602 --> 00:52:22,867
cut you open and let the dogs get at you.

722
00:52:24,373 --> 00:52:25,362
Oh, yeah?

723
00:52:28,177 --> 00:52:30,372
Bye-bye.

724
00:52:35,518 --> 00:52:37,816
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

725
00:52:37,887 --> 00:52:39,718
What happened?
- It's stuck.

726
00:52:43,459 --> 00:52:44,824
Uh-oh.

727
00:52:44,894 --> 00:52:47,829
That didn't work out like you planned,
did it?

728
00:52:47,897 --> 00:52:52,266
You know what? Mostly I'm disappointed.
It shows zero character.

729
00:52:52,334 --> 00:52:53,892
I know, I'm sorry.

730
00:52:53,969 --> 00:52:55,630
And you're a dick.

731
00:52:56,205 --> 00:53:00,403
You're a dick. You know what, ma'am?
You're a dick, too.

732
00:53:05,147 --> 00:53:07,877
- Here's that pee you ordered.
- Roll them up.

733
00:53:09,818 --> 00:53:13,754
- There you go, Tex.
- You're soaked with pee.

734
00:53:13,822 --> 00:53:15,380
Quick car wash?

735
00:53:15,457 --> 00:53:17,891
- God!
- Gross.

736
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:21,555
It smells like beef jerky. You know?

737
00:53:22,231 --> 00:53:25,291
It's just got like that sour sweetness.

738
00:53:27,436 --> 00:53:29,996
How can nobody go down a road
for an hour and a half?

739
00:53:30,072 --> 00:53:31,903
Why did they even make this stupid road?

740
00:53:31,974 --> 00:53:34,306
It's so hot out here.

741
00:53:34,376 --> 00:53:35,365
Ow!

742
00:53:38,814 --> 00:53:43,478
Oh, my God, your head.
Wait... Does it hurt? Let me see.

743
00:53:43,619 --> 00:53:45,678
Yes. It hurts.

744
00:53:47,957 --> 00:53:51,393
- What is that?
- Oh, my God.

745
00:53:54,964 --> 00:53:55,953
Wow.

746
00:54:08,644 --> 00:54:11,169
That is so beautiful.

747
00:54:20,389 --> 00:54:21,481
Need some help?

748
00:54:22,658 --> 00:54:27,686
- Yeah, but no offense...
- Right, 'cause I'm Amish,

749
00:54:27,763 --> 00:54:30,732
so I wouldn't know anything
about your '69 GTO Judge.

750
00:54:31,033 --> 00:54:34,799
455 Big Block, Ram Air. 4-11 posi,
something like that.

751
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:37,896
Weird, that thing must have fallen
straight from space.

752
00:54:37,973 --> 00:54:40,669
Well, good luck with the future ride,
spaceman.

753
00:54:43,379 --> 00:54:45,506
Hey, dude, wait up. Hold on.

754
00:54:45,881 --> 00:54:47,041
Wow!

755
00:54:47,116 --> 00:54:48,140
Okay.

756
00:54:48,217 --> 00:54:52,517
What are you doing? Whoa, whoa.
No, no, no. Leesh, that's a bad idea.

757
00:54:52,688 --> 00:54:53,848
- What?
- Come on.

758
00:54:53,922 --> 00:54:56,447
You don't know how far we have to walk.
Those are your only pair of shoes.

759
00:54:56,525 --> 00:54:59,790
You know what? You're probably right.
God, you're so sensible.

760
00:54:59,962 --> 00:55:02,624
But maybe I should? Or maybe I shouldn't?

761
00:55:02,698 --> 00:55:03,995
I should.

762
00:55:06,502 --> 00:55:08,197
I can't believe you just did that.

763
00:55:08,270 --> 00:55:11,364
So he met this chick on the Internet,
which is sketchy.

764
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,930
The Internet?

765
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:17,871
Yeah, it's like a series of computers
that are connected through...

766
00:55:17,946 --> 00:55:19,277
Computers?

767
00:55:20,916 --> 00:55:24,511
A computer is like a big calculator,
you know, with the screen.

768
00:55:24,586 --> 00:55:26,918
I'm just busting your balls, man.
I know what the Internet is.

769
00:55:29,758 --> 00:55:31,817
- Okay.
- You ever heard of Rumspringa?

770
00:55:31,894 --> 00:55:34,328
Yeah, that ska band from Delaware.

771
00:55:34,396 --> 00:55:38,594
No, it means "run wild." It's an Amish
tradition where when we turn 16,

772
00:55:38,667 --> 00:55:41,227
we can go live like you heathens
for a while.

773
00:55:41,303 --> 00:55:46,536
You go nuts, party for months or years
till your folks start hassling you,

774
00:55:46,608 --> 00:55:48,974
and then it's back to the Stone Age.

775
00:55:49,044 --> 00:55:51,035
But if you're on Rumspringa,
what's with the buggy?

776
00:55:51,113 --> 00:55:54,310
Oh, no. I'm not. Not anymore.

777
00:55:54,383 --> 00:55:56,783
I probably shouldn't even be
talking to you but...

778
00:55:56,852 --> 00:55:59,685
I'm a little bit of an Amish floutlaw.

779
00:55:59,755 --> 00:56:03,213
- Sometimes I just miss the world.
- What do you miss the most?

780
00:56:03,292 --> 00:56:06,489
You know, I miss sarcasm.
It's mostly lost on my people.

781
00:56:06,562 --> 00:56:07,586
Oh.

782
00:56:07,663 --> 00:56:13,363
And gambling. Went to Vegas once.
And buttfucking.

783
00:56:15,003 --> 00:56:17,198
Have a lot of nice memories there.

784
00:56:17,272 --> 00:56:19,103
I hear that.
- Oh, yeah.

785
00:56:19,942 --> 00:56:21,273
Buttfucking.

786
00:56:22,344 --> 00:56:24,812
Wait, are we talking about dudes?

787
00:56:25,547 --> 00:56:27,913
- No.
- Okay. Then yeah.

788
00:56:28,951 --> 00:56:32,785
I mean, unless that's what you're into,
and then, whatever.

789
00:56:32,855 --> 00:56:34,584
- It's not.
- No?

790
00:56:34,656 --> 00:56:35,645
No.

791
00:56:36,191 --> 00:56:38,853
- Not into dudes.
- No, no, no, no, no.

792
00:56:39,294 --> 00:56:41,819
- How old are you?
- Old enough.

793
00:56:43,432 --> 00:56:45,059
How old are you?

794
00:56:50,806 --> 00:56:52,637
This is gonna happen.

795
00:56:54,810 --> 00:56:57,142
It's gonna happen
whether you fight it or not.

796
00:56:57,212 --> 00:56:59,646
So I kind of want you to fight it.

797
00:57:01,283 --> 00:57:02,307
Cut.

798
00:57:02,384 --> 00:57:05,444
- All right. Now you.
- No way. Forget it.

799
00:57:05,521 --> 00:57:08,046
Dude, you never do anything crazy. Ever.

800
00:57:08,123 --> 00:57:11,251
Hey! I'm driving halfway across the country
to go to...

801
00:57:11,326 --> 00:57:14,887
To visit your grandma? Whoa!

802
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:17,828
So anyway, we're there and she's like...

803
00:57:19,768 --> 00:57:20,757
Oh, yeah.

804
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:22,764
Like, she won't stop crying.

805
00:57:22,838 --> 00:57:24,328
- That's the funniest thing, too.
- I know.

806
00:57:24,406 --> 00:57:28,240
I know, I was with this stripper in Vegas,
and I was like, "you want this?"

807
00:57:28,310 --> 00:57:31,905
So she's like, "Yeah, I want it, I want it."

808
00:57:33,148 --> 00:57:35,480
And I was like,
yeah, this gets hotter by the second.

809
00:57:35,551 --> 00:57:39,282
"What're you crying about?" She's like,
"...wanted to be a doctor."

810
00:57:39,354 --> 00:57:44,291
And I'm like,
"Yeah, you're a fucking Ph.D. of cock."

811
00:57:44,359 --> 00:57:46,259
- Yeah.
- Yeah, exactly.

812
00:57:46,328 --> 00:57:50,492
And then coercing my load
out on to the crying face.

813
00:57:50,566 --> 00:57:54,366
Vegas in general is just... Good times.

814
00:57:55,504 --> 00:57:57,665
You can get a blowjob for $10.

815
00:57:57,773 --> 00:58:01,971
Or for free if you meet the right girl
and tell her "I'm on Rumspringa."

816
00:58:02,044 --> 00:58:04,842
"What is this blowjob that you speak of?"

817
00:58:05,547 --> 00:58:07,913
"Your techno music beguiles me."

818
00:58:09,251 --> 00:58:11,310
Let me put it in your butt.

819
00:58:11,386 --> 00:58:13,081
You know, when you cut your foot on
a piece of glass,

820
00:58:13,155 --> 00:58:15,589
- don't think I'm gonna carry you.
- You know what? I will be fine. Okay?

821
00:58:15,657 --> 00:58:20,560
- I was born barefoot.
- Hey! Wait!

822
00:58:20,629 --> 00:58:23,689
Hey! Stop!

823
00:58:27,402 --> 00:58:29,393
Have a nice walk, shit-birds.

824
00:58:32,674 --> 00:58:34,005
Oh!

825
00:58:37,513 --> 00:58:40,141
Hey, Ian, Felicia, this is my boy, Ezekiel.

826
00:58:40,215 --> 00:58:41,910
What up, English?

827
00:58:50,859 --> 00:58:52,690
There's no service out here.

828
00:58:53,028 --> 00:58:56,054
- I can't even tell her I'll be late.
- Good. That's perfect. Keep her waiting.

829
00:58:56,131 --> 00:58:58,292
You don't want to come off as desperate.

830
00:58:58,367 --> 00:59:01,097
I'm driving nine hours.
How am I not coming off desperate?

831
00:59:01,169 --> 00:59:05,196
- We had shit to do.
- Uh-oh! See that creamy stuff?

832
00:59:06,108 --> 00:59:08,872
You blew your head gasket.
That's not good.

833
00:59:08,944 --> 00:59:11,469
- Shit.
- Don't cry. We can fix it.

834
00:59:11,547 --> 00:59:13,674
- Really?
- Yeah, really. We're good at it.

835
00:59:13,749 --> 00:59:15,273
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I didn't mean to undersell it,

836
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:16,476
but it's an impressive thing.

837
00:59:16,552 --> 00:59:18,383
- Yeah. We'll fix it.
- Wow, that'd be cool.

838
00:59:18,453 --> 00:59:22,685
Yeah, would be cool, wouldn't it?
I might be the coolest guy you ever met.

839
00:59:22,758 --> 00:59:23,986
- Wow.
- Wow.

840
00:59:24,993 --> 00:59:26,585
- Thank you.
- Yeah. You're welcome.

841
00:59:26,662 --> 00:59:29,256
That's what you say
when people do nice things for you.

842
00:59:29,331 --> 00:59:31,390
You know, there's a pretty big shindig
shaping up next door

843
00:59:31,466 --> 00:59:34,492
if you guys want to hang there
while we work on it.

844
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:37,403
Take it easy while we do all this for you.

845
00:59:40,042 --> 00:59:43,534
- Does he have an attitude?
- No, he's fucking with you.

846
00:59:44,413 --> 00:59:45,573
Okay.

847
00:59:46,949 --> 00:59:50,783
Just relax, man.
I got a good feeling about this, you know.

848
00:59:50,852 --> 00:59:52,285
You're gonna party with the Amish.

849
00:59:52,354 --> 00:59:55,414
Yeah, I'm sure it's gonna be
one kick-ass quilting bee.

850
00:59:58,393 --> 00:59:59,883
What's up, man?

851
00:59:59,962 --> 01:00:05,025
- Hey.
- No f-ing way!

852
01:00:07,102 --> 01:00:12,039
<i>When I'm home alone</i>
<i>I just can't stop myself</i>

853
01:00:12,708 --> 01:00:15,302
- This is insane!
- I know.

854
01:00:17,846 --> 01:00:24,809
<i>Signing off, " I'm all right in bed,</i>
<i>but I'm better with a pen"</i>

855
01:00:24,886 --> 01:00:29,880
<i>I'm all right in bed, but I'm better with a pen</i>

856
01:00:30,425 --> 01:00:35,488
<i>I'm all right in bed, but I'm better with a pen</i>

857
01:00:36,064 --> 01:00:41,559
<i>The kid was all right, but it went to his head</i>

858
01:00:49,277 --> 01:00:54,681
<i>Thank you, guys, very, very, very much.</i>
<i>You guys fucking rule, man.</i>

859
01:01:10,499 --> 01:01:14,230
Dude. Don't even bother.
Your game is not gonna work on that girl.

860
01:01:14,536 --> 01:01:18,666
What do you know about girls?
I've never even seen you with a girl.

861
01:01:19,408 --> 01:01:21,638
I'm gonna go check on the car.

862
01:01:27,616 --> 01:01:29,550
Yeah, fuck it. Let's dance.

863
01:01:29,985 --> 01:01:34,422
- Bite me. I'm not your consolation prize.
- Come on. Don't be hating.

864
01:01:39,094 --> 01:01:40,584
Fine.

865
01:01:52,610 --> 01:01:54,134
So at this point,
her panties are off,

866
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:56,475
but I'm still apprehensive
about her husband being there,

867
01:01:56,547 --> 01:01:58,105
'cause he is just staring at me.

868
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:03,880
Whoa! Hey, what is this?
Why are the seats out?

869
01:02:03,953 --> 01:02:06,285
Ian, do you know anything
about fixing these old Pontiacs?

870
01:02:06,355 --> 01:02:10,451
I don't care, okay?
Ezekiel, take all the pieces and just

871
01:02:10,526 --> 01:02:13,586
- put them back in there. I don't want...
- Ian, you've gotta calm down.

872
01:02:13,662 --> 01:02:14,993
Do you know any breathing exercises?

873
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:17,225
Because you are right on the verge
of a freak-out.

874
01:02:17,299 --> 01:02:22,100
You don't know my brother, okay?
He's gonna fuck my ass with a roll of quarters.

875
01:02:22,171 --> 01:02:25,800
What? He's gonna what? With what?

876
01:02:25,874 --> 01:02:30,641
Oh, yeah! He's gonna go get off work early,
and he's gonna walk into the bank,

877
01:02:30,713 --> 01:02:32,806
stand in line, change a 10,

878
01:02:32,948 --> 01:02:36,782
find my ass and just fuck it
with a roll of fucking quarters.

879
01:02:51,867 --> 01:02:53,664
Yeah, witness sucks!

880
01:02:55,237 --> 01:02:57,899
We've got to get that guy laid tonight.

881
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:00,467
Is your sister still a slut?

882
01:03:25,734 --> 01:03:30,068
Check it out. It's totally working.

883
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:32,369
You're the best wing-man ever.

884
01:03:32,441 --> 01:03:34,966
She's in, she's in. Watch this.

885
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:48,385
Rumspringa! Whoo!

886
01:03:50,259 --> 01:03:52,591
- I took a wicked digger.
- Yes, you did.

887
01:03:52,661 --> 01:03:55,152
I think you may have had a little too much
to drink. Maybe you should...

888
01:03:55,230 --> 01:04:00,429
Maybe you should shut your face hole
'cause I've only had one beer ever.

889
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:06,839
- First day of Rumspringa?
- Rumspringa!

890
01:04:09,978 --> 01:04:11,570
- Uh-oh!
- Oh!

891
01:04:14,149 --> 01:04:15,241
Hey.

892
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:23,050
- All right. Okay. You good? All right.
- Aw! You guys are so nice.

893
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:25,116
Don't let her step in it.

894
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:30,560
I love you guys 'cause you're awesome.

895
01:04:30,632 --> 01:04:32,463
'Cause you're awesome.

896
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:36,228
Let's just find a safe place to sleep it off.

897
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:40,300
What? What's wrong with you?

898
01:04:40,542 --> 01:04:44,308
- Yeah, what's your problem, bitch?
- Nothing. I'm fine.

899
01:04:44,446 --> 01:04:47,472
Nothing. She's fine. God, lay off.

900
01:04:47,783 --> 01:04:49,216
- It's Lance, right?
- No.

901
01:04:49,284 --> 01:04:51,650
I'll bet he's in there with that Amish girl
and you're out here.

902
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:52,744
Wrong.

903
01:04:52,821 --> 01:04:55,688
Come on, Leesh, just drop
the hard-ass thing for two minutes.

904
01:04:55,757 --> 01:04:59,386
You know. It's okay. You're into Lance.

905
01:05:01,897 --> 01:05:05,264
- God, I'm such an idiot.
- Look, there's something about Lance.

906
01:05:06,401 --> 01:05:10,633
Everybody likes Lance. I like Lance.

907
01:05:12,141 --> 01:05:15,076
Just promise me
you won't ever be like Lance.

908
01:05:17,012 --> 01:05:21,813
What is wrong with us?
Let's go have some fun. Come on.

909
01:05:22,351 --> 01:05:24,376
- No. No.
- No?

910
01:05:24,887 --> 01:05:29,824
Come on, we're young, and we're Amish,
and it's Rumspringa.

911
01:05:29,892 --> 01:05:31,382
Rumspringa!

912
01:05:58,687 --> 01:06:01,485
Ian, you little cock-sucker!

913
01:06:39,428 --> 01:06:40,452
Ah!

914
01:06:40,529 --> 01:06:43,191
Leesh, you're so stubborn.
Look at your feet.

915
01:06:43,265 --> 01:06:45,563
They are fine. All right?

916
01:06:47,069 --> 01:06:49,333
Hey. What's the plan?

917
01:06:50,672 --> 01:06:53,573
I might as well find a phone and call Rex

918
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:58,370
- so he can get on with killing me.
- What about visiting your grandma?

919
01:06:58,614 --> 01:07:02,072
Yeah, dude. You been putting off
visiting your grandma for too long.

920
01:07:02,150 --> 01:07:05,415
- It's about time you visited Grandma.
- Yeah.

921
01:07:05,487 --> 01:07:10,720
Lance, you know,
I really do want to visit my grandma, but...

922
01:07:10,792 --> 01:07:15,661
Dude, I really can't stress enough how
much you're gonna enjoy visiting Grandma.

923
01:07:16,031 --> 01:07:19,592
You know, I visit my grandma sometimes
two or three times a week,

924
01:07:19,668 --> 01:07:22,865
and it is always a pleasure.
She's just a delight.

925
01:07:23,005 --> 01:07:24,029
What am I supposed to do?

926
01:07:24,139 --> 01:07:26,437
Our transportation is all over the floor
of that barn.

927
01:07:26,508 --> 01:07:27,839
Hey, Mary!

928
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:31,201
Hi.

929
01:07:34,983 --> 01:07:38,282
Wow, you look beautiful.

930
01:07:38,754 --> 01:07:39,982
Oh, please.

931
01:07:40,055 --> 01:07:45,288
I mean, seriously, you wearing that,
churning some butter. Sexy.

932
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:48,090
So I had the best time with you last night.

933
01:07:48,163 --> 01:07:49,596
Yeah, me, too.

934
01:07:49,665 --> 01:07:52,532
So you got my number.
You're gonna call me, right?

935
01:07:53,702 --> 01:07:54,896
No.

936
01:07:56,071 --> 01:07:58,801
"No." You're funny.

937
01:07:59,541 --> 01:08:05,241
I mean, Lance, I really like you,
but Rumspringa's over for me.

938
01:08:06,081 --> 01:08:08,174
- So...
- Rumspringa!

939
01:08:14,456 --> 01:08:15,821
Sorry.

940
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:42,944
You fixed it?

941
01:08:43,018 --> 01:08:46,510
Yeah, we hit a few snags,
but she's banging like a champ now.

942
01:08:46,588 --> 01:08:49,455
Man, I don't even...
I don't even know what to say here.

943
01:08:49,524 --> 01:08:51,924
You know, I don't really have much...

944
01:08:51,993 --> 01:08:53,790
Oh, no, we're good. We're good.

945
01:08:53,862 --> 01:08:57,559
I mean, the opportunity to help a neighbor,
that's a gift.

946
01:08:57,933 --> 01:09:01,198
Man, you're too... Here, thanks.
Thank you so much.

947
01:09:01,269 --> 01:09:02,930
- You're welcome.
- Thank you, it's really cool.

948
01:09:03,004 --> 01:09:04,972
It is. You know, I mean,

949
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:08,373
if you felt the need to reciprocate
in some way,

950
01:09:08,443 --> 01:09:10,843
I mean, there's a lot of chores
that need to be done around here.

951
01:09:10,912 --> 01:09:15,008
Yeah, no, the only thing about that is
we're kind of behind schedule right now.

952
01:09:15,083 --> 01:09:17,108
Yeah, but, I mean,
we could totally come back.

953
01:09:17,185 --> 01:09:19,483
- We could hit you on our way back through.
- Okay.

954
01:09:19,554 --> 01:09:22,182
Yeah, you should.
You should really get on the road.

955
01:09:22,257 --> 01:09:27,092
I mean, you got a smooth-running
vehicle now, you know, 'cause we fixed it.

956
01:09:27,162 --> 01:09:31,997
- Yeah. No, but it's... So we're good?
- We're good. Yeah, technically.

957
01:09:32,267 --> 01:09:34,462
I mean, we fixed your car for free,
and you're leaving.

958
01:09:34,536 --> 01:09:37,164
So I'd say that makes us dead square.

959
01:09:38,573 --> 01:09:39,904
We'll come back. I promise.

960
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:43,274
- I'm looking forward to that.
- Hey, no, seriously, we will.

961
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:45,779
Okay. We'll all hold our breath
till you get back.

962
01:09:45,847 --> 01:09:48,941
On three, guys. Three, two...

963
01:09:58,627 --> 01:10:02,154
My stomach's killing me.
Tell me if you see a rest stop.

964
01:10:03,031 --> 01:10:04,464
You know, I really feel sorry for Mary

965
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:08,401
because her lifestyle is keeping her
from being happy.

966
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:10,700
And that's no way to live.

967
01:10:10,772 --> 01:10:14,572
Lance, don't you know your little theory of
"People want what they can't get."

968
01:10:14,643 --> 01:10:17,077
That's all she is. Ian, gas station.

969
01:10:17,145 --> 01:10:22,082
No. Felicia, this is different okay,
because she changed me.

970
01:10:22,150 --> 01:10:24,812
You know, I'm a butterfly now
because of her.

971
01:10:24,886 --> 01:10:29,482
Because when I'm with her,
I was like a spiritually whole human being.

972
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:33,688
And if you don't believe that,
you can suck my dick.

973
01:10:53,715 --> 01:10:56,707
Fuck. I know you didn't take my car, Ian.

974
01:10:56,952 --> 01:10:58,749
'Cause you're a big, giant pussy.
That's right.

975
01:10:58,820 --> 01:11:02,551
I'm gonna lift up this door
and my big fucking glorious bitchy Judge

976
01:11:02,624 --> 01:11:05,286
is gonna be sitting right there
gleaming at me,

977
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:08,420
or I'm gonna have the fucking
neighborhood squirrels eat your asshole.

978
01:11:26,014 --> 01:11:27,174
Want some of this?

979
01:11:32,721 --> 01:11:34,416
He took my fucking baby.

980
01:11:36,424 --> 01:11:37,755
Cocksucker!

981
01:11:41,930 --> 01:11:42,988
Shit!

982
01:11:43,064 --> 01:11:46,727
Hey, Knievel, what say you get
your bike out of the fricking road?

983
01:11:46,868 --> 01:11:49,359
<i> Hey! Hey!</i>

984
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:10,387
All <i>ocupado,</i> sport?

985
01:12:15,664 --> 01:12:18,462
Sounds like
someone's got one in sideways.

986
01:12:24,339 --> 01:12:25,533
Gents.

987
01:12:26,141 --> 01:12:30,339
Well, looks like we're up.
Go on, get in there.

988
01:12:38,887 --> 01:12:39,876
Oh!

989
01:12:40,822 --> 01:12:42,653
Am I getting a signal?

990
01:12:44,225 --> 01:12:47,456
Tasty, I got sidetracked last night.

991
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:51,556
I had to party with some new homies.

992
01:12:54,302 --> 01:12:58,500
Tonight, 8:00 p.m. at Big Boy.

993
01:13:00,208 --> 01:13:01,971
I'm worth the wait.

994
01:13:06,881 --> 01:13:07,870
Yes!

995
01:13:15,991 --> 01:13:20,018
No! Oh, God! No, thank you! No, thank you!

996
01:13:23,098 --> 01:13:26,625
Hello? Little buddy? Hello.

997
01:13:28,436 --> 01:13:30,370
Spooner. Spooner. Spooner.

998
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:36,704
Was that you screaming in there?
- I don't want to talk about it. Ever.

999
01:13:36,778 --> 01:13:39,804
- Where's Felicia?
- She went to get corn dogs.

1000
01:14:05,006 --> 01:14:07,304
Can you believe
the girls around here, man?

1001
01:14:07,375 --> 01:14:11,368
But, man, where am I ever gonna find
another girl as cool as Mary?

1002
01:14:14,582 --> 01:14:15,981
You like it?

1003
01:14:20,755 --> 01:14:23,315
- What about Felicia?
- What about her?

1004
01:14:26,761 --> 01:14:30,492
- She's into you.
- Yeah, no shit. Get in line.

1005
01:14:30,565 --> 01:14:33,295
What is that?
She's not good enough for you?

1006
01:14:33,368 --> 01:14:35,302
Felicia's awesome,

1007
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:38,498
but the obvious statement to make here
is that you like her.

1008
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:43,834
- What? No, I...
- You're shocked. You can't believe it.

1009
01:14:43,912 --> 01:14:48,315
- This bombshell. Come on.
- You know, she's not into me anyways.

1010
01:14:48,383 --> 01:14:52,444
Yeah, I know. But it doesn't matter.
I still... I could never do that to you.

1011
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:57,656
Okay, but you do know
that she's not into you, right?

1012
01:14:57,726 --> 01:15:02,186
- Yeah. Well, maybe you don't know.
- No. No, no, I'm gonna stop you.

1013
01:15:02,263 --> 01:15:06,723
There's no maybe. Okay?
And I'm saying this as your best friend,

1014
01:15:06,801 --> 01:15:12,398
but never. Never fucking ever. You know?

1015
01:15:12,474 --> 01:15:13,736
Because you guys are friends.

1016
01:15:13,808 --> 01:15:17,539
You know what every girl
I've ever banged had in common?

1017
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:20,910
I wasn't friends with any of them.

1018
01:15:20,982 --> 01:15:24,440
And usually they have awesome tits,
but not always.

1019
01:15:25,286 --> 01:15:28,187
Sometimes you get that bronze medal,
you know?

1020
01:15:28,256 --> 01:15:31,714
Real simple.
Climb the rope, hit the bell, win a prize.

1021
01:15:31,793 --> 01:15:35,320
Hey, there, Bilbo Baggins,
there's no height requirement.

1022
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:39,161
Why don't you step up
and win your girlfriend a prize?

1023
01:15:39,234 --> 01:15:41,498
We're not... She's not my girlfriend.

1024
01:15:41,569 --> 01:15:44,663
- What about your other girlfriend there?
- Nice.

1025
01:16:02,323 --> 01:16:04,120
All right, come on, Ian. You can do it.

1026
01:16:04,192 --> 01:16:07,355
Come on, you're almost there!
You're almost there! Go, go, go!

1027
01:16:07,562 --> 01:16:09,359
<i>Winner! Winner! Winner!</i>

1028
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:13,132
- That was awesome.
- How the hell did you do that?

1029
01:16:13,201 --> 01:16:15,396
We had one of these at Cub Scout camp.
I kind of mastered it.

1030
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:17,495
Yeah, you think you're hot shit?

1031
01:16:19,541 --> 01:16:22,476
- Lolly?
- Thank you.

1032
01:16:26,214 --> 01:16:27,943
Hey, hey, hey, ass.

1033
01:16:31,486 --> 01:16:33,477
Hey. What's your secret?

1034
01:16:33,555 --> 01:16:36,388
You just...
If you keep your shoulders down...

1035
01:16:36,457 --> 01:16:39,119
- No coaching.
- What?

1036
01:16:39,527 --> 01:16:41,893
No coaching there, Lombardi.
Read the sign.

1037
01:16:43,164 --> 01:16:44,563
No coaching.

1038
01:16:46,901 --> 01:16:48,528
Cheese and rice!

1039
01:16:49,070 --> 01:16:50,059
Oh!

1040
01:16:51,506 --> 01:16:54,873
- Thanks. I'm Sandy.
- I'm Ian.

1041
01:16:55,443 --> 01:16:56,705
- Hi.
- Hey.

1042
01:17:00,682 --> 01:17:04,880
- Consolation prize?
- Wow! Thank you so much.

1043
01:17:04,953 --> 01:17:07,649
You know, my dance team's performing
over at the tent in a couple of minutes.

1044
01:17:07,722 --> 01:17:09,087
You guys should come watch.

1045
01:17:09,157 --> 01:17:11,990
- Actually, we were just about to go.
- That sounds super fun. He'll be there.

1046
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:13,721
Great. See you.

1047
01:17:14,963 --> 01:17:17,193
Dude, that girl reeks of sex.

1048
01:17:18,032 --> 01:17:19,522
- Really?
- Yeah.

1049
01:17:19,767 --> 01:17:22,930
Hey, Harry Potter,
take you and your girlfriends out of here.

1050
01:17:24,706 --> 01:17:28,437
What are you looking at, Ellen DeGeneres?
I will crush you.

1051
01:17:29,043 --> 01:17:31,637
That's right. I'm not afraid to hit a lady.

1052
01:17:33,514 --> 01:17:36,608
<i>Everybody's talking all this stuff about me</i>

1053
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:40,177
<i>Why don't they just let me live?</i>

1054
01:17:41,489 --> 01:17:42,922
<i>I don't need permission</i>

1055
01:17:42,991 --> 01:17:44,891
- Do we really have time for...
- Hey, hey.

1056
01:17:44,959 --> 01:17:46,620
You have to stop doing that to him.

1057
01:17:46,694 --> 01:17:48,628
- Doing what?
- Twat blocking.

1058
01:17:48,696 --> 01:17:51,859
I'm not twat... Doing that.

1059
01:18:00,742 --> 01:18:05,042
<i>Yeah! Let's give it up for the AX Dancers!</i>

1060
01:18:06,147 --> 01:18:09,480
<i>Come on, girls,</i>
<i>let's help me get some fellas up in here.</i>

1061
01:18:11,352 --> 01:18:12,614
- Ian.
- Oh, no. Please.

1062
01:18:12,687 --> 01:18:14,746
Get up there. Come on.

1063
01:18:14,822 --> 01:18:16,084
Come on!

1064
01:18:16,958 --> 01:18:18,687
<i>In the back! In the back!</i>

1065
01:18:18,993 --> 01:18:21,086
<i>Yeah!</i>

1066
01:18:24,365 --> 01:18:26,356
<i>Come on, two more, two more!</i>

1067
01:18:28,469 --> 01:18:29,458
<i>Yeah!</i>

1068
01:18:32,473 --> 01:18:33,997
Dude, turn around.

1069
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:47,754
<i>Look at this fine crop</i>
<i>of handsome fellas I got here.</i>

1070
01:18:49,457 --> 01:18:52,153
<i>But before we get down to business,</i>

1071
01:18:52,226 --> 01:18:53,750
<i>there's a young woman here</i>

1072
01:18:53,828 --> 01:18:56,820
<i>who would like to share her story</i>
<i>with these young men.</i>

1073
01:18:56,898 --> 01:19:00,891
<i>- Kristy, you ready, baby?</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

1074
01:19:03,738 --> 01:19:08,004
<i>So, last year I was at a dance</i>
<i>with my boyfriend.</i>

1075
01:19:08,076 --> 01:19:10,169
<i>He wanted to go to his car.</i>

1076
01:19:10,845 --> 01:19:12,107
<i>So I did.</i>

1077
01:19:12,647 --> 01:19:18,142
<i>So we were both naked in the back seat</i>
<i>and we started having oral...</i>

1078
01:19:42,477 --> 01:19:44,069
<i>Yeah!</i>

1079
01:19:57,158 --> 01:19:59,092
<i>Daddy likes that!</i>

1080
01:20:01,529 --> 01:20:02,621
Excuse me!

1081
01:20:03,031 --> 01:20:08,401
<i>Excuse me!</i>
<i>Is this tragic story turning you on?</i>

1082
01:20:18,346 --> 01:20:23,613
<i>This courageous young lady pours</i>
<i>her heart out and this is getting you hot?</i>

1083
01:20:24,285 --> 01:20:26,651
<i>It's time for you to pledge. Right now!</i>

1084
01:20:27,155 --> 01:20:30,022
<i>Boy, you need this more than anybody.</i>

1085
01:20:31,392 --> 01:20:33,553
Hey, keep a wrinkle in it, captain.

1086
01:20:35,029 --> 01:20:39,489
I can't believe you took
a fucking abstinence pledge with a hard-on.

1087
01:20:39,667 --> 01:20:40,725
It's classic.

1088
01:20:40,802 --> 01:20:43,999
Look, I didn't even know what she was
talking about. That doesn't count! Okay?

1089
01:20:44,072 --> 01:20:45,937
- Ian! Hey!
- It gets better.

1090
01:20:46,007 --> 01:20:47,907
I am so proud of you!

1091
01:20:48,409 --> 01:20:50,001
Get away from me. Is that what you do?

1092
01:20:50,078 --> 01:20:53,411
You go out and you lure little dorks like me
into your little no-having-sex club?

1093
01:20:53,481 --> 01:20:55,472
Ian, it's not like that at all.

1094
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:58,212
Just go away. Now.

1095
01:21:02,056 --> 01:21:04,991
- I would've eaten your asshole, you know.
- Really?

1096
01:21:05,059 --> 01:21:06,151
- Oh, man.
- Wow.

1097
01:21:06,227 --> 01:21:09,287
You can keep your stupid
flipping lollipop, anyway!

1098
01:21:12,033 --> 01:21:14,297
- You are dead, psycho-virgin!
- No, no!

1099
01:21:14,368 --> 01:21:16,302
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1100
01:21:19,373 --> 01:21:23,810
Hey, are you sure you want to get
dental work done in Floater, Kentucky?

1101
01:21:24,912 --> 01:21:27,278
Dr. Teddescoe will be with you present-like.

1102
01:21:27,348 --> 01:21:28,838
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

1103
01:21:41,796 --> 01:21:45,095
Fine, okay, you were right.
My feet are killing me,

1104
01:21:45,166 --> 01:21:47,794
and I never should've tossed my shoes.

1105
01:21:48,102 --> 01:21:52,004
No, come on.
I love that your shoes are in that tree.

1106
01:21:54,709 --> 01:21:57,644
I do. That's premium Felicia.

1107
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,370
Felicia Alpine.

1108
01:22:01,415 --> 01:22:02,404
Oh.

1109
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:07,449
- So what'd you do to her?
- Hmm?

1110
01:22:07,522 --> 01:22:08,614
Smack her around a little bit?

1111
01:22:08,956 --> 01:22:10,856
She gets out of line, you pop her one?

1112
01:22:10,925 --> 01:22:14,588
- No. No, sir, I...
- I got you. I'm just teasing you, man.

1113
01:22:14,662 --> 01:22:16,254
We have fun.

1114
01:22:17,231 --> 01:22:19,290
- He didn't, though, did he?
- Hmm? Mmm-mmm.

1115
01:22:19,367 --> 01:22:21,858
Blink twice if you feel you're in danger.

1116
01:22:23,204 --> 01:22:25,297
Be back in a couple minutes.
I'm gonna wait for that to numb up.

1117
01:22:25,373 --> 01:22:26,397
Mmm-hmm.

1118
01:22:26,474 --> 01:22:28,499
Hands to yourself, O.J.

1119
01:22:30,511 --> 01:22:34,572
Ian, you know the other night
at Lance's party?

1120
01:22:37,285 --> 01:22:40,311
- Was I there?
- No, come on.

1121
01:22:41,889 --> 01:22:43,754
Here.

1122
01:22:47,328 --> 01:22:53,289
I mean, you know the only reason is
because I don't want to ruin our friendship.

1123
01:22:54,502 --> 01:22:58,734
Totally, I mean friendship is awesome.
Good call.

1124
01:22:59,941 --> 01:23:04,037
I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost you.

1125
01:23:11,619 --> 01:23:16,215
- You won't.
- What are you thinking about?

1126
01:23:18,593 --> 01:23:21,653
- What are you thinking about?
- I asked you first.

1127
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:27,394
You got a little loogie.

1128
01:23:30,471 --> 01:23:32,496
I'm gonna go see if Lance...

1129
01:23:32,573 --> 01:23:33,597
Mmm-hmm.

1130
01:23:33,674 --> 01:23:35,232
Go. Go.

1131
01:23:47,455 --> 01:23:50,982
Um, I'll take these as well.

1132
01:23:55,196 --> 01:23:59,758
They're not for me. They're not.

1133
01:24:08,442 --> 01:24:11,206
- Heads up.
- What's with you?

1134
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:15,139
I'm thinking maybe we head back home.

1135
01:24:15,216 --> 01:24:16,979
What? Why?

1136
01:24:17,218 --> 01:24:20,813
Well, Felicia and I were talking in there,

1137
01:24:20,888 --> 01:24:24,619
- and we kind of had a moment.
- Oh! Oh, did you guys have a little moment?

1138
01:24:24,692 --> 01:24:26,284
- Yeah.
- You're a moron.

1139
01:24:26,927 --> 01:24:29,452
Fuck you. We've talked about this.

1140
01:24:29,764 --> 01:24:32,927
Look, we're almost there,
and I'm not letting her do this.

1141
01:24:33,034 --> 01:24:36,060
We're going to Knoxville,
and you're getting your nut.

1142
01:24:36,771 --> 01:24:38,864
No, I'm not. I'm not.

1143
01:24:38,939 --> 01:24:41,737
No, I'm gonna text Tasty,
and I'm gonna tell her I'm not coming.

1144
01:24:41,809 --> 01:24:45,074
- Ian, get in this car.
- I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it.

1145
01:24:45,546 --> 01:24:50,074
Shit, where's my phone?
Hey, you got a new smile.

1146
01:24:50,151 --> 01:24:53,450
You have my phone. I didn't know...
This is for you.

1147
01:24:55,089 --> 01:24:56,386
Mmm! A message came in.

1148
01:24:56,590 --> 01:24:59,491
Your grandma says she's really excited
to see you.

1149
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:01,892
And something about her hot,
shaved pussy.

1150
01:25:01,962 --> 01:25:03,293
Must be the cancer talking.

1151
01:25:04,465 --> 01:25:07,434
All right. Good deal.
We're going to Knoxville.

1152
01:25:11,272 --> 01:25:12,261
<i>All I've got is frustration, frustration</i>

1153
01:25:15,609 --> 01:25:18,806
<i>I hate this vacation</i>

1154
01:25:19,447 --> 01:25:21,915
<i>So, give up, give up</i>
<i>Give up, give up</i>

1155
01:25:23,117 --> 01:25:26,780
<i>I've got to get away from here</i>
<i>It's killing me just thinking 'bout</i>

1156
01:25:26,854 --> 01:25:31,791
<i>Frustration, frustration</i>
<i>I hate this vacation...</i>

1157
01:25:31,859 --> 01:25:34,327
Ian, you're going the wrong way.

1158
01:25:34,595 --> 01:25:36,563
- We're going home.
- What?

1159
01:25:37,131 --> 01:25:40,123
Please, do not turn around
because of me. Okay.

1160
01:25:40,201 --> 01:25:42,533
- Yeah, no shit.
- I'm dying to see Ms. Tasty.

1161
01:25:42,603 --> 01:25:43,968
This is going to be hilarious.

1162
01:25:44,038 --> 01:25:46,506
A hundred bucks says she has a wiener.

1163
01:25:46,574 --> 01:25:49,475
Look, I said we're going home.
I don't want to talk about it.

1164
01:25:49,543 --> 01:25:51,135
I knew you'd find some way
to fuck this up for him.

1165
01:25:51,212 --> 01:25:54,613
Me? You two are fucking scheming
behind my back.

1166
01:25:54,682 --> 01:25:57,048
- No, we're not.
- Okay. You stole Rex's car.

1167
01:25:57,118 --> 01:25:58,813
You drove halfway across the country.

1168
01:25:58,886 --> 01:26:01,878
This must be what you want to do.
So do it, chicken shit!

1169
01:26:01,956 --> 01:26:04,356
- Fucking A, chicken shit.
- Fine! You know what?

1170
01:26:04,425 --> 01:26:07,417
I'll turn the car around, I'll flip a bitch,
and I'll go pork somebody. Right now.

1171
01:26:07,495 --> 01:26:08,962
I'll be that guy. Is that what you want?

1172
01:26:09,029 --> 01:26:10,826
- Be that guy! That guy rules.
- Sounds awesome.

1173
01:26:10,898 --> 01:26:14,493
- That would make me so happy.
- All right. All right. Fantastic! I'm doing it.

1174
01:26:14,668 --> 01:26:17,603
Watch out, Ian! Fuck!
- Watch it, Ian!

1175
01:26:19,807 --> 01:26:20,933
Whoo!

1176
01:26:22,109 --> 01:26:24,634
You like that?
- Did your fucking balls just drop?

1177
01:26:24,712 --> 01:26:26,202
Holy shit, Ian.

1178
01:26:27,148 --> 01:26:33,849
- Oh, man, it's this douche again.
- You want it? You got it.

1179
01:26:34,922 --> 01:26:36,890
- Hold on to your pantyhose.
- Okay, we gotta work on your banter,

1180
01:26:36,957 --> 01:26:39,187
but otherwise, this is awesome.

1181
01:26:42,129 --> 01:26:44,927
- You're losing him.
- No, I got him. I got him.

1182
01:26:47,334 --> 01:26:51,065
- Jesus, Ian! Not so close.
- God damn it!

1183
01:26:55,643 --> 01:26:57,611
No way, man! You're dead.

1184
01:26:59,613 --> 01:27:01,513
Sorry. He's all right.

1185
01:27:02,116 --> 01:27:04,710
This guy's fucking dangerous!

1186
01:27:10,257 --> 01:27:11,952
Where is he? Talk to me, dudes.

1187
01:27:12,059 --> 01:27:14,653
Right up our ass. He's in our ass.

1188
01:27:19,333 --> 01:27:22,530
He's tagging out.
- Ladies!

1189
01:27:22,603 --> 01:27:23,627
Ian, look out!

1190
01:27:29,877 --> 01:27:31,174
Oh! Oh!

1191
01:27:31,245 --> 01:27:32,405
God damn it.

1192
01:27:34,181 --> 01:27:37,912
What were you doing, man? Shit.

1193
01:27:39,453 --> 01:27:42,047
Dude, take it easy. This wasn't your fault.
He jumped right in front of you.

1194
01:27:42,122 --> 01:27:45,057
Just shut up, Lance. Of course it's my fault.

1195
01:27:45,392 --> 01:27:46,859
Now, come on, man,
this possum's not gonna fuck you.

1196
01:27:46,927 --> 01:27:48,485
We gotta go find Ms. Tasty.

1197
01:27:48,562 --> 01:27:52,931
He's suffering, Lance. I'm not gonna
leave him here by himself. Okay?

1198
01:27:54,201 --> 01:27:56,931
Okay. You're right.

1199
01:27:58,873 --> 01:28:02,172
We gotta help him.
We gotta call a vet or something.

1200
01:28:02,710 --> 01:28:07,773
Ian, look at him.
There's not a lot that we can do.

1201
01:28:09,483 --> 01:28:12,179
You may want to cover your eyes,
sweetheart, there could be some splatter.

1202
01:28:12,253 --> 01:28:15,416
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I'm gonna take him out of his misery.

1203
01:28:15,489 --> 01:28:19,016
They don't make little wheelchairs for him.
He's done, man.

1204
01:28:19,093 --> 01:28:22,859
Fuck you, Lance.
God, you don't even give a shit about him.

1205
01:28:24,131 --> 01:28:25,496
I'll do it.

1206
01:28:34,708 --> 01:28:36,039
I'm sorry.

1207
01:28:40,281 --> 01:28:42,078
All possums go to heaven.

1208
01:28:43,317 --> 01:28:49,119
Uh... Ian. It... I think it's still...

1209
01:28:50,257 --> 01:28:51,656
Shit.

1210
01:28:58,832 --> 01:29:00,766
Oh, no.

1211
01:29:01,502 --> 01:29:04,733
Ian, I'm so sorry, it's...

1212
01:29:04,805 --> 01:29:10,766
Oh, God! Jesus fucking... God damn it!
I'm trying to do the right thing here.

1213
01:29:11,445 --> 01:29:16,144
- He's really hanging in there.
- God! Fuck!

1214
01:29:17,084 --> 01:29:21,043
You know, Jamie Lynn Spears' baby
has got to be about a year old now.

1215
01:29:21,121 --> 01:29:22,679
I can't believe she had a fucking baby.

1216
01:29:30,331 --> 01:29:32,356
How was I supposed to know
it was an endangered possum?

1217
01:29:32,433 --> 01:29:35,095
You know, the vet said there's actually
a good chance he might pull through.

1218
01:29:35,169 --> 01:29:37,660
You better hope so, mister. Get in.

1219
01:29:39,773 --> 01:29:41,263
Lock up cell B.

1220
01:29:47,181 --> 01:29:48,705
We are in jail.

1221
01:29:58,025 --> 01:30:00,960
Okay, listen, you have got to be cool,
'cause if they see you shitting yourself

1222
01:30:01,028 --> 01:30:02,086
they're gonna fuck with us.

1223
01:30:02,162 --> 01:30:04,153
Hey! Hey, ladies.

1224
01:30:04,398 --> 01:30:07,959
Hey, how about you sit the fuck back down
before me and you have a problem?

1225
01:30:08,035 --> 01:30:11,766
How about you just chill out, man?
Be cool.

1226
01:30:11,839 --> 01:30:14,364
- All right. We good?
- Yeah, we're good.

1227
01:30:25,986 --> 01:30:30,855
- Excuse me.
- Listen, old man, I'm only gonna tell you...

1228
01:30:32,660 --> 01:30:35,026
You should've seen the look in his eyes.

1229
01:30:35,596 --> 01:30:38,429
His heart was breaking
for this poor little thing.

1230
01:30:38,666 --> 01:30:43,365
Shit, that boy Ian don't seem
like he got no balls at all.

1231
01:30:43,437 --> 01:30:47,237
Why? 'Cause he got to fussing some
over a suffering critter?

1232
01:30:47,708 --> 01:30:49,733
I think that's real sweet.

1233
01:30:49,810 --> 01:30:53,075
Well, I say this Lance,
he sounds like a real hunk of man.

1234
01:30:53,580 --> 01:30:57,175
The only way you can keep his kind around
is to get his babies up in you pronto.

1235
01:30:57,251 --> 01:30:59,685
But he got no respect for bitches.

1236
01:31:00,521 --> 01:31:05,220
Shathayd's right. No respect for bitches.
None whatsoever.

1237
01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:08,894
You love Ian, don't you, baby?

1238
01:31:11,965 --> 01:31:16,527
Well, it's just we've been best friends
since we were really little,

1239
01:31:17,004 --> 01:31:20,496
and I don't know, he's the only person
I can really talk to, you know?

1240
01:31:20,808 --> 01:31:23,368
You give your heart to that boy,

1241
01:31:23,444 --> 01:31:28,814
and you can toss that "friendship" right out
the motherfucking window.

1242
01:31:28,882 --> 01:31:34,479
When I was a girl, my best friend was
a fella named Creighton McDaniel.

1243
01:31:35,456 --> 01:31:41,019
We used to stay up all night just talking
and laughing and carrying on.

1244
01:31:42,229 --> 01:31:46,928
Then one day I got it into my head
that we ought to be more than friends.

1245
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,332
So I tell him I love him.

1246
01:31:49,870 --> 01:31:51,360
What happened?

1247
01:31:54,508 --> 01:31:56,203
We dated for a few weeks.

1248
01:31:57,377 --> 01:31:59,777
Then he met a gal over in Wofford.

1249
01:32:01,148 --> 01:32:03,480
We still talk from time to time.

1250
01:32:04,651 --> 01:32:07,176
But it was never the same between us.

1251
01:32:14,495 --> 01:32:20,798
Baby. Come here.
Come on, now. Come on, now.

1252
01:32:22,736 --> 01:32:26,103
You know you need a hug.
Come on, honey.

1253
01:32:27,541 --> 01:32:29,065
Cuddle up.

1254
01:32:33,147 --> 01:32:34,136
Dude.

1255
01:32:35,516 --> 01:32:39,145
- What?
- Look, you're pissing in front of everybody.

1256
01:32:41,922 --> 01:32:43,514
Yeah, I am.

1257
01:32:43,590 --> 01:32:46,889
- And that guy's looking right at your dick.
- Atta-boy.

1258
01:32:49,163 --> 01:32:52,724
- Look at you. You're a new man.
- No, I'm not.

1259
01:32:52,933 --> 01:32:57,597
Dude. You stole a car, ran over a hillbilly,

1260
01:32:57,671 --> 01:33:00,697
you got arrested, you got in a prison fight.

1261
01:33:01,475 --> 01:33:03,375
See Duane, he was there.

1262
01:33:03,443 --> 01:33:06,071
And I mean, you really beat
an endangered species to death today.

1263
01:33:06,146 --> 01:33:07,807
That's got to count for something.

1264
01:33:07,881 --> 01:33:12,113
And now you're in here in jail pissing
like a big dog in front of all the perverts.

1265
01:33:12,186 --> 01:33:13,813
I mean, there's only one thing left.

1266
01:33:13,887 --> 01:33:17,152
Yeah, well, that's out.
I was supposed to meet her two hours ago.

1267
01:33:18,392 --> 01:33:20,257
Dude, when we get out of here,
just tell her you got pinched.

1268
01:33:20,327 --> 01:33:23,626
She'll think that's bad-ass,
because it totally is.

1269
01:33:24,631 --> 01:33:27,657
Lafferty, Nesbitt, your bail has been posted.

1270
01:33:27,868 --> 01:33:28,892
Really?

1271
01:33:29,069 --> 01:33:33,096
- Time to go.
- Shit!

1272
01:33:33,173 --> 01:33:35,607
- What?
- Rex.

1273
01:33:35,909 --> 01:33:36,898
Oh.

1274
01:33:39,046 --> 01:33:41,173
All right, this is it for us, Duane,

1275
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:43,079
but, you know, back to what we were
talking about earlier,

1276
01:33:43,150 --> 01:33:45,243
I don't give a shit what Denise says,

1277
01:33:45,319 --> 01:33:47,913
I think there's still room for somebody
to write the great American novel.

1278
01:33:47,988 --> 01:33:51,014
So take that for whatever it's worth, buddy.

1279
01:33:59,366 --> 01:34:00,458
Hey.

1280
01:34:02,236 --> 01:34:03,726
Mary!

1281
01:34:08,575 --> 01:34:10,509
Wait. Wait. How did you find me?

1282
01:34:10,577 --> 01:34:13,603
Well, I called your cell phone,
and then someone answered here.

1283
01:34:13,680 --> 01:34:19,050
- That's awesome. Okay.
- Are you okay? Why are you in jail?

1284
01:34:21,421 --> 01:34:22,410
I mean, there's a number of charges,

1285
01:34:22,489 --> 01:34:24,684
but the most prominent ones
were animal cruelty

1286
01:34:24,758 --> 01:34:26,817
and the assaulting the officer.

1287
01:34:26,894 --> 01:34:29,454
But it's not nearly as bad
as it sounds on paper, okay? I promise.

1288
01:34:29,529 --> 01:34:32,589
- Okay.
- Okay. Wait right here. Okay.

1289
01:34:34,434 --> 01:34:35,924
- Teddy.
- Lance, my man.

1290
01:34:36,003 --> 01:34:38,267
- You guys got my stuff?
- It's gonna be a few minutes.

1291
01:34:38,338 --> 01:34:39,396
All right.

1292
01:34:39,473 --> 01:34:41,270
- Your daughter still selling those cookies?
- Yes.

1293
01:34:41,341 --> 01:34:43,969
You find me that wallet, I'll buy one.

1294
01:34:44,044 --> 01:34:46,069
- That'd be nice of you.
- How is she now?

1295
01:34:46,146 --> 01:34:50,173
I'm just fucking with you.
I don't need one more charge brought.

1296
01:35:16,877 --> 01:35:20,142
<i> You can't know, oh, no</i>
<i>You can't know</i>

1297
01:35:20,213 --> 01:35:25,845
<i>How much I think about you, no</i>

1298
01:35:26,954 --> 01:35:30,014
<i>It's making my head spin</i>

1299
01:35:33,193 --> 01:35:36,651
<i>Looking at you</i>
<i>And you are looking at me</i>

1300
01:35:36,730 --> 01:35:40,291
<i>And we both know what we want</i>

1301
01:35:43,303 --> 01:35:45,271
<i>So close to giving in</i>

1302
01:35:47,074 --> 01:35:53,980
Ian, don't do this. No,
don't turn into Lance. You're a good guy.

1303
01:35:54,648 --> 01:35:56,912
Yeah, well, that's why I'm still a virgin.

1304
01:35:56,984 --> 01:36:01,785
So what if you're a virgin?
God, Ian, it's just sex. It's not...

1305
01:36:01,855 --> 01:36:07,020
No, Felicia, it's not about the sex.
It's not. I'm weird.

1306
01:36:07,094 --> 01:36:10,791
I'm the only virgin I know.
I need to get this done

1307
01:36:11,498 --> 01:36:14,399
so everyone can just stop
freaking out about it.

1308
01:36:14,801 --> 01:36:17,668
Look, I know you don't approve,
but I'm sorry, I just...

1309
01:36:17,738 --> 01:36:19,330
I'm not going home a virgin.

1310
01:36:19,406 --> 01:36:21,271
Then, sport, fuck me.

1311
01:36:23,677 --> 01:36:24,837
What?

1312
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:29,342
Sport, fuck me and not some stranger.

1313
01:36:30,517 --> 01:36:33,975
We're friends so you know
you're not gonna get some, like,

1314
01:36:34,054 --> 01:36:38,320
crabs or genital warts
or some pussing thing that's coming...

1315
01:36:38,392 --> 01:36:40,917
Wow, Leesh. That's hot!

1316
01:36:43,296 --> 01:36:44,854
You know what?

1317
01:36:45,866 --> 01:36:49,962
I think I'd rather stay a virgin forever
than lose it on pity-sex.

1318
01:36:50,604 --> 01:36:53,539
- I'm not talking about pity-sex.
- Then what are you talking about?

1319
01:36:53,607 --> 01:36:56,735
I don't know. Sex.

1320
01:36:57,444 --> 01:37:03,440
It doesn't have to mean anything.
It doesn't have to jeopardize our friendship.

1321
01:37:03,850 --> 01:37:04,874
Ah!

1322
01:37:04,951 --> 01:37:07,681
Leesh, you know what?
Fuck the friendship!

1323
01:37:08,522 --> 01:37:10,285
I'm sorry, I just can't do it.

1324
01:37:10,357 --> 01:37:14,487
I can't be the guy that you're gonna talk to
about your boyfriends anymore. I can't...

1325
01:37:14,861 --> 01:37:17,261
I can't be the guy who's gonna pick you up
in the middle of the night,

1326
01:37:17,330 --> 01:37:21,699
and you're gonna cry to because
Derrick Dicottes found some other girl.

1327
01:37:22,903 --> 01:37:26,930
And maybe I'm just being selfish here,
but it is not enough.

1328
01:37:27,007 --> 01:37:30,408
Okay, so I'm gonna go out that door,
and I'm gonna go have meaningless sex

1329
01:37:30,477 --> 01:37:35,574
with some random, hopefully hot, hopefully
female person that I met on the Internet.

1330
01:37:37,651 --> 01:37:40,381
Unless you've got something better
to say to me.

1331
01:37:57,704 --> 01:37:59,569
That's what I thought.

1332
01:38:28,668 --> 01:38:30,158
Cyclops.

1333
01:38:33,573 --> 01:38:37,407
- How'd you find me?
- You ever heard of LoJack, cheese-dick?

1334
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:43,908
Come here.

1335
01:38:44,017 --> 01:38:46,850
<i> Burn that mother down, y'all</i>

1336
01:38:47,087 --> 01:38:48,486
<i>Burn, baby, burn</i>

1337
01:38:48,722 --> 01:38:50,553
<i>Disco inferno</i>

1338
01:38:50,657 --> 01:38:52,147
<i>Burn, baby, burn</i>

1339
01:38:52,225 --> 01:38:53,249
<i>Burn that mother down</i>

1340
01:38:53,326 --> 01:38:56,159
Come on, Rex, wait. The girl...
The one I told you about from the Internet.

1341
01:38:56,229 --> 01:38:59,630
She's right across the street, Rex.
She wants to do it with me and everything.

1342
01:38:59,699 --> 01:39:01,428
Like I give a shit!

1343
01:39:14,281 --> 01:39:16,181
Get your shit, queer-bait!
We're going home.

1344
01:39:16,249 --> 01:39:17,910
Okay. Okay, fine.

1345
01:39:18,185 --> 01:39:20,176
Now!

1346
01:39:20,253 --> 01:39:22,153
It probably wouldn't have changed

1347
01:39:22,222 --> 01:39:25,680
all these feelings
that I've been having lately anyway.

1348
01:39:27,294 --> 01:39:29,785
What are you talking about?

1349
01:39:29,863 --> 01:39:33,731
I don't know, Rex. You know, just feelings,

1350
01:39:35,335 --> 01:39:40,329
curiosity about men.

1351
01:39:42,842 --> 01:39:44,469
Oh, shit, Ian!

1352
01:39:45,845 --> 01:39:50,873
I think you might be right.
I think I might be getting gay.

1353
01:39:51,084 --> 01:39:55,578
God damn it. Fuck!

1354
01:39:56,890 --> 01:40:00,189
But I just haven't had
any luck with girls, Rex.

1355
01:40:00,260 --> 01:40:04,219
No way! No way my little brother's
taking it in the chili ring.

1356
01:40:10,937 --> 01:40:14,134
All right, you take the car,

1357
01:40:15,041 --> 01:40:17,839
and you go bang the female woman
like the good Lord intended.

1358
01:40:17,911 --> 01:40:19,401
You've got one hour!

1359
01:40:20,313 --> 01:40:22,213
- Ian.
- Yeah?

1360
01:40:24,551 --> 01:40:26,416
Fill up the tank, would you, buddy?

1361
01:40:26,486 --> 01:40:29,046
- Tank is at a little low. Yeah, thanks.
- Right.

1362
01:40:51,111 --> 01:40:55,377
Hey, man. You looking for somebody?

1363
01:40:59,319 --> 01:41:00,581
Ms. Tasty.

1364
01:41:01,888 --> 01:41:03,082
Ian?

1365
01:41:09,462 --> 01:41:12,693
Oh, my gosh! Hey.

1366
01:41:12,766 --> 01:41:15,098
I was sure you were standing me up.

1367
01:41:16,536 --> 01:41:21,132
- But here you are. Look at you.
- See you.

1368
01:41:21,207 --> 01:41:24,233
You look a little different than your picture.

1369
01:41:24,311 --> 01:41:27,906
Yeah, I know. I lost a lot of weight
'cause I had the runs... The flu.

1370
01:41:29,549 --> 01:41:34,077
Well, you're mighty cute,
and your car is really pretty.

1371
01:41:34,954 --> 01:41:36,819
Why don't you take me for a ride?

1372
01:41:42,595 --> 01:41:46,361
So, Ms. Tasty, what's your real name?

1373
01:41:47,767 --> 01:41:53,899
- How about I tell you after?
- Yeah, sure.

1374
01:41:55,909 --> 01:41:57,536
Works for me.

1375
01:42:04,784 --> 01:42:11,587
<i>... below the ocean</i>
<i>Where I wanna be</i>

1376
01:42:12,258 --> 01:42:14,283
<i>She may be</i>

1377
01:42:14,361 --> 01:42:17,728
<i>Way down below the ocean...</i>

1378
01:42:17,797 --> 01:42:20,960
- No, Mary, wait.
- What?

1379
01:42:21,034 --> 01:42:24,435
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. I mean...

1380
01:42:25,004 --> 01:42:29,134
Nothing, I just... I really like you,

1381
01:42:31,845 --> 01:42:36,248
and I don't want to ruin this. You know?

1382
01:42:37,117 --> 01:42:42,111
But, hey, maybe you could come
to Chicago and we could hang out

1383
01:42:42,188 --> 01:42:44,019
- and take it a little...
- No.

1384
01:42:44,124 --> 01:42:47,958
Lance, it doesn't work like that.

1385
01:42:51,398 --> 01:42:54,834
And, I mean, if I don't go back,
I'm gonna be shunned.

1386
01:42:56,302 --> 01:42:58,600
I could never see my family again.

1387
01:43:00,173 --> 01:43:04,576
- This Amish thing is a real motherfucker.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

1388
01:43:13,653 --> 01:43:15,382
- Ian.
- Yeah.

1389
01:43:15,455 --> 01:43:17,685
I think we should take our clothes off.

1390
01:43:19,559 --> 01:43:21,356
Wow. Really? Right here?

1391
01:43:21,428 --> 01:43:22,417
Mmm-hmm.

1392
01:43:22,862 --> 01:43:26,025
No one's around for miles. Come on.

1393
01:43:26,933 --> 01:43:28,059
Okay.

1394
01:43:36,476 --> 01:43:39,912
- What do you think?
- Thank you.

1395
01:43:41,614 --> 01:43:47,075
That is one of the better sets
that I've seen today.

1396
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:49,715
I appreciate your honesty.

1397
01:43:50,723 --> 01:43:51,951
They're nice.

1398
01:43:52,692 --> 01:43:54,319
Really?

1399
01:43:54,394 --> 01:43:56,988
You're fit.

1400
01:43:57,063 --> 01:44:01,022
- You're so sweet.
- Yeah.

1401
01:44:02,869 --> 01:44:06,361
I think we should
take your clothes off now.

1402
01:44:06,439 --> 01:44:09,670
Yeah, maybe we should.

1403
01:44:09,742 --> 01:44:14,805
- I don't play football!
- Okay.

1404
01:44:14,881 --> 01:44:17,145
I... I really don't.
I mean, I don't really even watch football.

1405
01:44:17,217 --> 01:44:19,344
I mean, I got all that stuff
from <i>Friday Night Lights,</i>

1406
01:44:19,419 --> 01:44:22,388
which is a show. It's also a movie
starring Billy Bob Thornton.

1407
01:44:22,455 --> 01:44:24,446
- I don't know if you saw it, but...
- Ian.

1408
01:44:24,524 --> 01:44:30,588
What? You think everything in my profile's
the God's honest truth? No.

1409
01:44:30,663 --> 01:44:33,564
Now, come on, take your clothes off.

1410
01:44:35,969 --> 01:44:40,599
Look, there's this girl...

1411
01:44:41,674 --> 01:44:45,906
Ian, this can be our little secret.
No one has to know.

1412
01:44:47,447 --> 01:44:48,937
Now come here.

1413
01:45:02,395 --> 01:45:07,423
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I can't do this with you.

1414
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:12,199
I'm kissing you,
and I'm thinking about somebody else.

1415
01:45:13,106 --> 01:45:17,008
No, and I know that's a stupid thing to say.
I mean, she's not even...

1416
01:45:18,845 --> 01:45:22,906
Oh, no, no, no.
Ms. Tasty, please don't cry.

1417
01:45:22,982 --> 01:45:26,748
It's not a reflection of...
You're so pretty, like...

1418
01:45:27,453 --> 01:45:29,148
You're laughing.

1419
01:45:29,222 --> 01:45:32,191
Just take your fucking clothes off, asshole!

1420
01:45:33,293 --> 01:45:36,694
Look, I'm sorry, okay.
I don't mean to lead you on here,

1421
01:45:36,763 --> 01:45:41,223
and I'll give you a ride home,
but I don't think that... What the fuck?

1422
01:45:41,301 --> 01:45:43,735
What's up with the bandana, dude? Huh?

1423
01:45:44,103 --> 01:45:45,502
What're you, a Gap model?

1424
01:45:48,141 --> 01:45:51,235
- Do you have any jacks?
- Yup.

1425
01:45:52,645 --> 01:45:56,172
- I win.
- Again.

1426
01:45:56,249 --> 01:45:57,477
Yup.

1427
01:46:01,854 --> 01:46:04,379
- All right, just take your shirt off.
- Okay, good.

1428
01:46:07,460 --> 01:46:11,726
You were right, Ian. '69 Judge.
You were worth the wait.

1429
01:46:14,634 --> 01:46:19,697
- Please, no! Come on, it's not even my car!
- And good luck with the lady friend.

1430
01:46:22,342 --> 01:46:23,639
Fuckface!

1431
01:46:26,980 --> 01:46:30,416
Felicia. Oh, shit! Oh, shit.

1432
01:46:30,516 --> 01:46:34,111
Oh, Bobby,
you were so awesome back there.

1433
01:46:34,187 --> 01:46:35,950
- Love you so much.
- Cool.

1434
01:46:37,223 --> 01:46:41,683
Hey, you know, I was thinking, do you
always have to flash them the twins?

1435
01:46:41,761 --> 01:46:43,922
You know, I mean, I do got a gun.

1436
01:46:43,997 --> 01:46:48,957
- Oh, baby, you know they're only for you.
- Okay, cool.

1437
01:46:49,035 --> 01:46:52,061
Now, listen. I got another car coming
any minute now, okay?

1438
01:46:52,138 --> 01:46:53,833
- Got it.
- So take me back to the Big Boy

1439
01:46:53,906 --> 01:46:56,306
- and get this goat over to Luis.
- Right.

1440
01:46:57,677 --> 01:47:03,877
And where is Luis? 5th and Crescent!

1441
01:47:04,450 --> 01:47:06,680
- I fucking told you.
- I know where it is.

1442
01:47:11,324 --> 01:47:16,557
And if you do good,
momma's gonna take real good care of you.

1443
01:47:16,929 --> 01:47:18,157
Really?

1444
01:47:20,566 --> 01:47:23,228
You mean the thing I like well?

1445
01:47:28,441 --> 01:47:32,309
Yeah, just want to make sure we're talking
about the same thing here.

1446
01:47:32,378 --> 01:47:34,346
The pepper grinder.

1447
01:47:38,384 --> 01:47:40,477
Pepper grinder!

1448
01:47:41,487 --> 01:47:44,285
Pepper grinder! Yeah.

1449
01:47:52,565 --> 01:47:53,623
Hi.

1450
01:47:59,605 --> 01:48:03,166
- Hey, boys. You finally made it.
- What's up, Ms. Tasty?

1451
01:48:03,242 --> 01:48:05,767
What's up? What's up?

1452
01:48:05,845 --> 01:48:08,473
- Damn, you're hot as fuck.
- Yeah.

1453
01:48:08,548 --> 01:48:11,847
- We brought beers and rubbers.
- And some lotion for your tits.

1454
01:48:13,119 --> 01:48:14,780
- It's not a marathon.
- It's a sprint.

1455
01:48:14,854 --> 01:48:17,288
- Bang. Yeah.
- In chicks.

1456
01:48:31,337 --> 01:48:32,895
You Felicia?

1457
01:48:35,675 --> 01:48:37,074
I'm Bobby Jo.

1458
01:48:38,578 --> 01:48:39,602
Hi.

1459
01:48:49,789 --> 01:48:54,419
I can't believe I'm banging an Amish chick.
I mean, seriously, what are the odds?

1460
01:48:55,528 --> 01:48:57,792
Oh, yeah! More of that.

1461
01:48:59,832 --> 01:49:04,929
So, wait, you do want to party?

1462
01:49:05,638 --> 01:49:06,764
With us?

1463
01:49:06,839 --> 01:49:10,070
Yeah. I want us all to get naked and party.

1464
01:49:22,555 --> 01:49:25,547
Fuck! I can't fucking believe this.

1465
01:49:29,996 --> 01:49:32,829
Get your ass out of the car, motherfucker!

1466
01:49:34,667 --> 01:49:39,331
- Who the fuck are you?
- Holy fucking fuck-balls!

1467
01:49:39,572 --> 01:49:43,736
Okay, my bad.

1468
01:49:43,810 --> 01:49:45,505
Now, I thought you were someone else,
all right?

1469
01:49:45,578 --> 01:49:50,948
You done fouled up my ride,
so I'm gonna have to take yours.

1470
01:49:51,818 --> 01:49:52,807
Fuck that shit.

1471
01:49:53,986 --> 01:49:56,079
Here you go. Pulls to the left.

1472
01:49:57,857 --> 01:49:59,848
What the fuck, dumb-ass?

1473
01:50:03,796 --> 01:50:06,230
Oh, shit!

1474
01:50:06,999 --> 01:50:13,268
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! Oh, shit!

1475
01:50:13,339 --> 01:50:15,034
Hey, highlights, back it up.

1476
01:50:16,475 --> 01:50:18,340
Bite my dick, asshole!

1477
01:50:23,216 --> 01:50:26,049
Ow! What the fuck you do that for?

1478
01:50:27,186 --> 01:50:31,384
- Lance? What the fuck is going on?
- That's the son of a bitch I was looking for!

1479
01:50:31,457 --> 01:50:34,517
Hey, guy. How'd you...

1480
01:50:34,594 --> 01:50:37,995
- Found your computer maps, douche-bag!
- Okay.

1481
01:50:38,064 --> 01:50:39,224
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1482
01:50:39,298 --> 01:50:42,165
Boat show,
you and your boyfriend bring it in here.

1483
01:50:42,235 --> 01:50:43,497
I don't need no trouble right now.

1484
01:50:43,569 --> 01:50:45,434
Let's go. Bring it in.

1485
01:50:46,873 --> 01:50:50,570
- Bobby Jo, who the fuck is that?
- Who?

1486
01:50:50,643 --> 01:50:53,908
- That!
- That's Felicia.

1487
01:50:53,980 --> 01:50:56,210
She was hiding in the back seat,
no biggie.

1488
01:50:56,282 --> 01:50:58,773
Fuck! She heard everything then.

1489
01:50:58,851 --> 01:51:01,479
- Hello!
- Damn, you're right.

1490
01:51:03,956 --> 01:51:05,480
Come on, darling.

1491
01:51:05,558 --> 01:51:07,856
- Shut up!
- Now, take it easy on the hair.

1492
01:51:07,927 --> 01:51:10,657
- Get down!
- Hey, hey, come on.

1493
01:51:10,730 --> 01:51:13,597
- All right, all right.
- Take your hands off her!

1494
01:51:25,311 --> 01:51:28,303
Stop shooting our car.
- Inconsiderate.

1495
01:51:33,819 --> 01:51:35,810
Please! No!

1496
01:51:41,627 --> 01:51:44,687
- All right. Get back, man.
- Ian?

1497
01:51:44,764 --> 01:51:47,460
Everybody just be cool.

1498
01:51:47,533 --> 01:51:50,093
- Felicia, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1499
01:51:50,169 --> 01:51:53,229
Ian, give me the goddamn gun
before you shoot your dick off.

1500
01:51:53,306 --> 01:51:54,500
- Rex, I got this.
- Ian!

1501
01:51:54,573 --> 01:51:58,304
God damn it, Rex, I got this!
Do not fuck with me! Not now!

1502
01:51:59,211 --> 01:52:02,339
Ease it back, man.
That donut ain't fucking around.

1503
01:52:04,083 --> 01:52:05,812
Hands where I can see them.

1504
01:52:07,153 --> 01:52:11,283
- Ian, dude, you're working the mouth.
- I don't give a shit!

1505
01:52:11,357 --> 01:52:15,487
Okay. All right, sorry.
You're doing so good. Proud of you.

1506
01:52:15,561 --> 01:52:17,153
I mean that. I don't say it enough.

1507
01:52:17,229 --> 01:52:20,323
- Tasty and you...
- Bobby Jo.

1508
01:52:21,500 --> 01:52:25,163
Ian... Over there. Slowly.

1509
01:52:25,905 --> 01:52:30,103
All right, you, corn-fed, you can
punch my friend Lance, but just once.

1510
01:52:30,209 --> 01:52:33,406
- Dude! What the fuck?
- You nailed his girlfriend.

1511
01:52:33,479 --> 01:52:36,607
- Not exactly. I mean, it was...
- And he came all this way.

1512
01:52:36,682 --> 01:52:40,209
All right. All right, fair enough.
Just not in the nuts.

1513
01:52:43,823 --> 01:52:49,056
- Oh, shit!
- Okay. Okay, all right.

1514
01:52:50,730 --> 01:52:55,531
What a punch.
I think my kids are gonna be retarded.

1515
01:52:55,601 --> 01:52:57,569
You got a fucking cannon for an arm, dude.

1516
01:52:57,636 --> 01:53:03,006
- Yeah, you got a little...
- Thanks. My ears are ringing.

1517
01:53:03,609 --> 01:53:05,474
Stop it! I'm warning you!

1518
01:53:05,544 --> 01:53:08,138
Come on, bro. You ain't gonna kill no one.

1519
01:53:10,716 --> 01:53:11,808
Whoa!

1520
01:53:13,753 --> 01:53:16,881
- Anybody can shoot a gun in the air, dude.
- I'll shoot you in the leg.

1521
01:53:16,956 --> 01:53:18,548
Suck his cock, Ian.

1522
01:53:18,624 --> 01:53:21,422
- You serious?
- Do I look serious?

1523
01:53:23,462 --> 01:53:25,430
I don't think you got the plums, boy.

1524
01:53:29,001 --> 01:53:30,730
God!

1525
01:53:35,274 --> 01:53:36,434
Oh, fuck.

1526
01:53:37,276 --> 01:53:39,744
Okay. Okay.

1527
01:53:41,480 --> 01:53:44,347
Anybody can shoot someone
in the leg, dude.

1528
01:53:45,551 --> 01:53:48,850
- Give me the gun!
- Jesus, man, what do I got to do?

1529
01:53:51,957 --> 01:53:54,858
Don't move, asshole,
or you're a fucking stain.

1530
01:53:54,927 --> 01:53:56,053
Okay.

1531
01:53:57,329 --> 01:53:59,320
Holy shit, Ian. Right on!

1532
01:54:00,766 --> 01:54:03,030
Where do you think you're going, cunt?

1533
01:54:03,102 --> 01:54:04,501
Cat fight!

1534
01:54:07,206 --> 01:54:10,471
<i>'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore</i>

1535
01:54:10,543 --> 01:54:12,101
Damn you, whore!

1536
01:54:12,178 --> 01:54:13,907
<i>I've forgotten what I started fighting for</i>

1537
01:54:13,979 --> 01:54:15,606
Fuck you!

1538
01:54:17,783 --> 01:54:21,844
<i>And if I have to crawl upon the floor</i>

1539
01:54:22,221 --> 01:54:25,713
<i>Come crashing through your door</i>

1540
01:54:26,625 --> 01:54:31,426
<i>Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore</i>

1541
01:54:32,498 --> 01:54:34,591
Drop the weapon, donut man!

1542
01:54:36,035 --> 01:54:38,367
Okay, put your hands on your head!

1543
01:54:38,437 --> 01:54:41,998
- Both hands, asshole!
- I can't move the other arm.

1544
01:54:42,074 --> 01:54:45,771
- Who said that? Who said that?
- I can't move the other arm.

1545
01:54:48,180 --> 01:54:52,173
Sir, I'm not resisting. It's foam, sir.

1546
01:54:55,521 --> 01:54:59,321
The big Mexican won't go down!
Take the shot!

1547
01:55:00,092 --> 01:55:01,753
- Holy shit.
- Jesus!

1548
01:55:01,827 --> 01:55:04,660
Hold your fire! Hold your fire, okay?

1549
01:55:04,763 --> 01:55:08,859
He is not the bad guy! She is the car thief.

1550
01:55:09,602 --> 01:55:13,163
Right there. The blond, in a belt for a skirt.

1551
01:55:21,247 --> 01:55:22,737
Anything else?

1552
01:55:24,683 --> 01:55:27,618
Oh, yeah,
apparently there's a guy named Luis,

1553
01:55:27,686 --> 01:55:31,452
and he has a chop shop
at 5th and Crescent!

1554
01:55:31,524 --> 01:55:34,015
- Thanks.
- We were just banging that chick in our car.

1555
01:55:34,093 --> 01:55:37,221
- Yeah, you mentioned that.
- Yeah, super hard.

1556
01:55:37,296 --> 01:55:43,326
The boy did have some plums.
He had some plums.

1557
01:55:43,402 --> 01:55:46,565
Hey, this is Rick.
He's played arena football.

1558
01:55:46,639 --> 01:55:48,971
- Hi. I'm Mary.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

1559
01:55:49,041 --> 01:55:50,702
That's a weird little dude you got there.

1560
01:55:50,776 --> 01:55:53,677
Are you guys hungry?
Is this place open 24 hours?

1561
01:55:56,415 --> 01:55:58,975
Thank you for coming for me.

1562
01:56:00,085 --> 01:56:03,077
What were you doing in the back seat?

1563
01:56:03,155 --> 01:56:06,352
Nothing. I was...

1564
01:56:06,425 --> 01:56:10,384
- You were stalking me.
- No, I wasn't. I...

1565
01:56:12,231 --> 01:56:15,667
Okay. Yeah, I was stalking you just a little.

1566
01:56:17,169 --> 01:56:20,696
I just... I knew you were gonna do
something you were gonna regret, and I...

1567
01:56:20,773 --> 01:56:24,937
Felicia. Why can't you just say it?

1568
01:56:29,982 --> 01:56:34,078
- Why can't you?
- Well, I asked you first.

1569
01:56:41,894 --> 01:56:43,589
Fine. I'll say it.

1570
01:56:50,236 --> 01:56:53,865
- You love me.
- Fine.

1571
01:56:56,008 --> 01:56:57,873
You love me, too, then.

1572
01:57:03,148 --> 01:57:08,484
<i> Life is beautiful</i>

1573
01:57:11,523 --> 01:57:15,220
<i>But it's complicated</i>

1574
01:57:15,294 --> 01:57:16,659

1577
01:57:49,561 --> 01:57:51,119
- You fixed it!
- Yeah.

1578
01:57:51,196 --> 01:57:52,823
Don't lean on it.

1579
01:57:55,267 --> 01:57:57,565
I guess you get to live.

1580
01:57:57,636 --> 01:58:00,662
You guys are amazing.
- Thanks.

1581
01:58:00,739 --> 01:58:02,263
Let's talk seriously for a second.

1582
01:58:02,341 --> 01:58:08,041
I figure with the parts and labor,
you know, out the door... 4,200.

1583
01:58:10,049 --> 01:58:11,073
Oh. Um...

1584
01:58:11,150 --> 01:58:14,813
- It's just a round number.
- Yeah. No, I didn't really...

1585
01:58:19,024 --> 01:58:20,321
I don't know what to...

1586
01:58:20,392 --> 01:58:23,418
I'm fucking with you, Ian. We're good, man.

1587
01:58:23,495 --> 01:58:27,625
- Wait, I mean, you're serious?
- Yeah. I'm serious. We're good. No worries.

1588
01:58:27,700 --> 01:58:29,031
- You sure?
- Yeah, of course.

1589
01:58:29,101 --> 01:58:30,090
- Thank you, man.
- It's what I live for,

1590
01:58:30,169 --> 01:58:32,069
fixing other people's shit for free.

1591
01:58:35,774 --> 01:58:36,866
Yeah.

1592
01:58:42,548 --> 01:58:44,880
- Hey.
- Straight home, pussy!

1593
01:58:44,950 --> 01:58:49,216
- Dude, we got to go.
- Fucking piece of shit!

1594
01:58:49,321 --> 01:58:52,984
You go on ahead.
I think I'm gonna stay here, kick it Amish.

1595
01:58:53,058 --> 01:58:54,923
Dude, what are you talking about?

1596
01:58:55,027 --> 01:58:58,554
I don't know, a little hard work,
fresh air, missionary position.

1597
01:58:59,398 --> 01:59:01,127
It's a man's life.

1598
01:59:01,200 --> 01:59:02,895
- Sounds pretty good, you know.
- Yeah, it sounds...

1599
01:59:02,968 --> 01:59:05,596
Come on, Lance. Get serious.

1600
01:59:10,042 --> 01:59:11,441
Come here.

1601
01:59:12,411 --> 01:59:15,278
I gotta tell you, I'm impressed.
I'm proud of you, you know.

1602
01:59:15,347 --> 01:59:18,441
You held out for a good one,
the one you wanted.

1603
01:59:19,284 --> 01:59:21,809
And you fucking made it happen.

1604
01:59:22,921 --> 01:59:27,722
But, please, I'm begging you,
go take that girl to visit Grandma.

1605

- All right.
- And when you do, don't...

1606
01:59:30,129 --> 01:59:33,326
- Lance, I got it.
- Yeah?

1607
01:59:34,867 --> 01:59:35,959
Yeah.

1608
01:59:37,970 --> 01:59:40,530
Okay. I think you might.

1609
01:59:40,606 --> 01:59:42,369

02:03:37,242 --> 02:03:38,436
if you couldn't have gotten to your shows,

1654
02:03:38,510 --> 02:03:43,379
I imagine all those weeping teenage girls
outside, "I need to dance."

1655
02:03:43,448 --> 02:03:46,417
Could we send you some pictures?
We don't really have cash or anything.

1656
02:03:46,485 --> 02:03:49,454
- Some autographed photos?
- Or we could give you CDs.

1657
02:03:49,521 --> 02:03:51,751
Yeah, we've got a lot of use
for that around here.

1658
02:03:51,823 --> 02:03:53,916
There is a lot of work
that needs to be done around here.

1659
02:03:53,992 --> 02:03:58,258
- You guys are some strapping young lads.
- I don't know if we're really built for that.

1660
02:03:59,698 --> 02:04:02,223
- Yeah.
- I can hear you.

1661
02:04:02,300 --> 02:04:04,700
I'm just saying,
you guys put in a 20-minute show,

1662
02:04:04,770 --> 02:04:06,397
- we spent all night on the bus...
- Yeah.

1663
02:04:06,471 --> 02:04:07,665
I mean, that was a lot of work.

1664
02:04:07,739 --> 02:04:09,934
We could maybe try
to write a check later on,

1665
02:04:10,008 --> 02:04:12,476
or like I said,
we could send you guys some CDs.

1666
02:04:12,544 --> 02:04:14,774
City folk are always trying to solve things
with money.

1667
02:04:14,846 --> 02:04:16,871
It's the spirit of the community
around here.

1668
02:04:16,948 --> 02:04:19,473
Lord, please bless this Fall Out Boy.

1669
02:04:19,551 --> 02:04:22,315
Keep him safe on the road.

1670
02:04:22,387 --> 02:04:25,481
Help him to aspire
to the heights of Jon Bon Jovi.

1671
02:04:25,557 --> 02:04:26,785
- Help him to...
- Thanks.

1672
02:04:26,858 --> 02:04:28,758
- Okay, thanks, man.
- Thanks, man. We gotta roll.

1673
02:04:28,827 --> 02:04:30,761
- Amen.
- We gotta roll, man. Thank you very much.

1674
02:04:30,829 --> 02:04:32,387
All right, boys.
It was a pleasure meeting you.

1675
02:04:32,464 --> 02:04:35,433
I loved your penis on the Internet,
by the way.

1676
02:04:35,500 --> 02:04:37,559
- Fucking asshole!
- You're a dick!

1677
02:04:53,985 --> 02:04:57,921
<i>Say my name and his in the same breath</i>

1678
02:04:57,989 --> 02:05:01,447
<i>I dare you to say they taste the same</i>

1679
02:05:01,526 --> 02:05:05,053
<i>Let the leaves fall off in the summer</i>

1680
02:05:05,130 --> 02:05:08,190
<i>And let December glow feel flames</i>

1681
02:05:08,767 --> 02:05:11,861
<i>Brace myself and let go</i>

1682
02:05:11,937 --> 02:05:15,498
<i>Start it over again in Mexico</i>

1683
02:05:15,574 --> 02:05:19,374
<i>These friends, they don't love you</i>

1684
02:05:19,444 --> 02:05:23,107
<i>They just love the hotel suites, now</i>

1685
02:05:23,181 --> 02:05:26,241
<i>I don't care what you think</i>

1686
02:05:26,318 --> 02:05:29,981
<i>As long as it's about me</i>

1687
02:05:30,122 --> 02:05:33,285
<i>The best of us can find happiness</i>

1688
02:05:33,391 --> 02:05:36,554
<i>In misery</i>

1689
02:05:36,928 --> 02:05:40,523
<i>Said, I don't care what you think</i>

1690

1691
02:05:44,469 --> 02:05:47,734
<i>The best of us can find happiness</i>

1692
02:05:47,806 --> 02:05:49,603
<i>In misery</i>

1693
02:05:55,580 --> 02:05:59,175
<i>Oh, take a chance,</i>
<i>let your body get a tolerance</i>

1694
02:05:59,251 --> 02:06:02,152
<i>I'm not a chance,</i>
<i>but a heat wave in your pants</i>

1695
02:06:02,220 --> 02:06:04,780
<i>Pull a breath like another cigarette</i>

1696
02:06:04,856 --> 02:06:07,347
<i>Palms up, I'm trading 'em</i>

1697
02:06:08,160 --> 02:06:09,991
<i>Trading 'em</i>

1698
02:06:10,061 --> 02:06:13,189
<i>I'm the oracle in my chest</i>

1699
02:06:13,565 --> 02:06:16,466
<i>Let the guitar scream like a fascist</i>

1700
02:06:16,535 --> 02:06:18,230
<i>Sweat it out, shut your mouth</i>

1701
02:06:18,303 --> 02:06:20,100
<i>Free love on the streets</i>

1702
02:06:20,172 --> 02:06:24,199
<i>But in the alley and I ain't that cheap, now</i>

1703
02:06:24,276 --> 02:06:27,268
<i>I don't care what you think</i>

Hi. I'm Amanda Crew, professional actor.

1730
02:09:06,504 --> 02:09:08,836
You know in all the teen unrated DVDs,

1731
02:09:08,907 --> 02:09:12,468
you never really get to see
the star's naughty parts.

1732
02:09:12,944 --> 02:09:16,380
Well, that is gonna change today.

1733
02:09:16,448 --> 02:09:18,348
That's right. Take a seat,

1734
02:09:18,416 --> 02:09:21,249
maybe close the door
so mom doesn't come in.

1735
02:09:21,319 --> 02:09:24,220
Get all ready. Looks good.

1736
02:09:25,623 --> 02:09:26,954
Here we go.

1737
02:09:30,695 --> 02:09:32,185
Suckers!

1738
02:09:33,832 --> 02:09:35,129
This is serious matter.

1739
02:09:36,234 --> 02:09:37,394
Run for your life.

1740
02:09:37,469 --> 02:09:40,063
Oh, shit! You know what?
We see the fake balls on the table there.

1741
02:09:41,239 --> 02:09:43,969
All right. We'll shoot another. Cut.
- Cut.
