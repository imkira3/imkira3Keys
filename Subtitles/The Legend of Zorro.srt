2
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:18,380
Brother Ignacio?
What are you doing?

3
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:21,756
Five rings, padre.

4
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,763
To summon Zorro
in case there's trouble.

5
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,553
If I know Zorro, he's already here.

6
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,994
Aren't you supposed to be
in school?

7
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,078
Padre, what if Zorro comes?

8
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,457
I'll make sure he carves a Z on
your backside. How's that sound?

9
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,454
Really?

10
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:43,505
A landslide in favour of statehood.

11
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,344
Let's hope the rest of California
voted the same, huh?

12
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,302
Take this to the governor.

13
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,639
Hermano, be careful.
Our future's in your hands.

14
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,688
I pray that the other provinces
have been as peaceful as ours.

15
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:25,796
The latest model in heavy artillery,
the Henry repeater.

16
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:30,049
If God didn't hurl lightning,
he'd surely carry one of these.

17
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:31,680
State your business, McGivens.

18
00:04:33,355 --> 00:04:34,470
I haven't voted yet.

19
00:04:35,816 --> 00:04:38,733
I'm sorry, you're too late.
The polls have already closed.

20
00:04:38,944 --> 00:04:42,811
Now, that doesn't seem equitable.
I have rights too.

21
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:47,066
Now, if you'd be kind enough,
hand me that box, I'll be on my way.

22
00:04:47,661 --> 00:04:50,697
You'd only force the people
to vote again.

23
00:04:50,914 --> 00:04:54,746
Well, you remember that Babylon
was condemned to ashes...

24
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,245
...for extending its empire
to inferior races!

25
00:04:58,797 --> 00:05:02,296
I come to deliver the Lord's work
against this vote.

26
00:05:23,655 --> 00:05:25,778
Time to do the Lord's work.

27
00:05:33,999 --> 00:05:35,908
Zorro! Zorro! Zorro!

28
00:05:44,342 --> 00:05:47,129
Move it. Move it. Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

29
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,965
Get him!

30
00:10:40,134 --> 00:10:42,423
Over the hill
to the governor's mansion.

31
00:10:43,638 --> 00:10:47,256
I said, over the hill
to the governor's mansion!

32
00:10:51,688 --> 00:10:53,810
We really have to work
on your English.

33
00:11:09,497 --> 00:11:12,533
Zorro! Zorro! Zorro!

34
00:11:23,803 --> 00:11:26,210
What happened?
Where are my men?

35
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:29,135
They were held up, governor.
I offered my help.

36
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,898
Citizens of San Mateo!

37
00:11:47,117 --> 00:11:50,321
Today we have voted
to join the Union as a free state!

38
00:11:54,124 --> 00:11:57,244
But this is only the beginning.
In three months...

39
00:11:57,461 --> 00:12:01,328
...every vote of every pueblo
around California will be counted!

40
00:12:01,757 --> 00:12:05,624
And it is my hope that we will
finally call ourselves...

41
00:12:05,844 --> 00:12:07,671
...Americans!

42
00:12:58,354 --> 00:12:59,635
Good boy.

43
00:13:13,411 --> 00:13:16,697
Your saddle is getting
a little too tight, amigo.

44
00:13:46,819 --> 00:13:48,479
Tell me we won.

45
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,737
Tell me we are free.

46
00:13:51,782 --> 00:13:53,442
We're free.

47
00:13:56,871 --> 00:13:59,444
- To statehood.
- To us.

48
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,786
I wish I was there today.

49
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:06,957
You were.

50
00:14:09,466 --> 00:14:11,755
I cannot believe it.

51
00:14:12,344 --> 00:14:14,253
We have our lives back.

52
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:17,344
Now we can take Joaquin
to a trip to Spain.

53
00:14:17,558 --> 00:14:19,301
I cannot imagine
how it has changed.

54
00:14:19,518 --> 00:14:21,178
- Elena...
- And New York.

55
00:14:21,395 --> 00:14:23,802
You should see
New York, Alejandro.

56
00:14:24,022 --> 00:14:28,601
It's as if the whole world
has moved onto one tiny island.

57
00:14:28,819 --> 00:14:30,479
Elena, I've been thinking and...

58
00:14:30,696 --> 00:14:32,653
Never a good sign.

59
00:14:33,782 --> 00:14:37,862
Listen, California won't really be
a state for another three months.

60
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:39,109
Yes?

61
00:14:39,329 --> 00:14:43,493
The federal marshals may need help
keeping things under control until then.

62
00:14:45,043 --> 00:14:48,957
Look, I know what you're thinking...
Elena. Elena, listen, listen.

63
00:14:49,172 --> 00:14:53,668
No, here is me, here is quitting.
We're this far apart. Elena.

64
00:14:56,221 --> 00:15:00,266
I cannot believe it.
I cannot believe I fell for it.

65
00:15:01,351 --> 00:15:04,802
Husband promises to quit,
gullible wife believes him.

66
00:15:05,021 --> 00:15:07,061
How could I be so stupid?

67
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:08,981
Oh, Elena, you're overreacting.

68
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:11,936
I'm overreacting?

69
00:15:12,153 --> 00:15:13,529
You made a promise.

70
00:15:13,738 --> 00:15:15,980
- We made a promise.
- I know.

71
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:17,990
You are missing
your son's entire life.

72
00:15:18,201 --> 00:15:20,953
No, no, no. No, no, no.
I am not missing anything.

73
00:15:21,162 --> 00:15:22,538
- Oh, really?
- Really.

74
00:15:22,872 --> 00:15:24,580
What is his teacher's name?

75
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,578
That's an easy one.
Mister... Brother...

76
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:30,960
Father Kin... Jin... Hoofer?

77
00:15:32,173 --> 00:15:34,249
So I have a bad memory.
What does that prove?

78
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:36,875
That you do not know your own son.

79
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:40,553
And even worse,
he does not know you.

80
00:15:40,932 --> 00:15:42,556
What would you rather have me do?

81
00:15:42,767 --> 00:15:45,637
Live my life as a wealthy don?
Order servants around all day?

82
00:15:45,853 --> 00:15:49,803
Is that what you think I do, huh?
Order servants around all day?

83
00:15:50,024 --> 00:15:52,729
No, no, don't twist my words.
People still need Zorro.

84
00:15:52,944 --> 00:15:56,277
No, no, no. You need Zorro.

85
00:15:57,031 --> 00:15:59,652
Look me in the eyes
and tell me that is not true.

86
00:16:06,707 --> 00:16:09,744
You remember what you said
the day Joaquin was born?

87
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:14,837
"My family is my life."

88
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:20,334
Do you know how lucky you are
to have made it this far? Alive?

89
00:16:20,805 --> 00:16:23,426
That your enemies have not
discovered who we are?

90
00:16:25,476 --> 00:16:30,636
For 10 years, you have fought
to give California its freedom.

91
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,098
Why can't you give us ours?

92
00:16:47,414 --> 00:16:49,122
They are calling you.

93
00:16:51,835 --> 00:16:55,204
It's who I am, Elena. It's who I am.

94
00:16:59,927 --> 00:17:01,884
What happened to the man
I married?

95
00:17:02,095 --> 00:17:04,717
What happened to the woman
who used to fight by my side?

96
00:17:04,931 --> 00:17:06,342
She had a son.

97
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,470
So he'll grow up to be
a nice little aristocrat...

98
00:17:09,686 --> 00:17:11,560
...who has no idea
where he came from...

99
00:17:11,772 --> 00:17:15,141
...and doesn't care about anyone
but himself. Beautiful.

100
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,939
If you walk out that door,
you are not sleeping here tonight.

101
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:25,900
Maybe I'll just take my suitcase.

102
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,199
I hope you and Tornado
are very happy together.

103
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:32,994
We will be.

104
00:17:34,878 --> 00:17:36,158
I love you.

105
00:18:48,117 --> 00:18:50,489
I spy with my little eye...

106
00:18:50,703 --> 00:18:53,988
...something beginning with H.

107
00:18:54,206 --> 00:18:56,080
Why wasn't Papi at breakfast?

108
00:18:56,292 --> 00:18:58,498
I told you. He left early on business.

109
00:18:58,711 --> 00:19:01,202
He always goes on business.

110
00:19:01,714 --> 00:19:03,089
Yes, he does.

111
00:19:03,841 --> 00:19:05,121
What exactly does he do?

112
00:19:05,926 --> 00:19:09,924
Well, he is a don.
And he meets with other dons...

113
00:19:10,139 --> 00:19:12,843
...and they discuss land
and investments...

114
00:19:13,058 --> 00:19:15,514
...and it's all very important work.

115
00:19:15,727 --> 00:19:17,886
So he sits around with friends
counting money.

116
00:19:18,105 --> 00:19:21,972
Oh, Joaquin. You should not be
so hard on your father.

117
00:19:22,192 --> 00:19:24,730
You are more like him
than you think.

118
00:19:25,153 --> 00:19:27,644
We can talk more about this later,
all right?

119
00:19:30,158 --> 00:19:31,190
I love you.

120
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:11,253
Who are you?

121
00:21:11,467 --> 00:21:14,883
The real question, Señora de la Vega,
is who are you?

122
00:21:15,095 --> 00:21:17,384
The devoted wife of a wealthy don?

123
00:21:17,598 --> 00:21:22,390
Or an independent woman held
captive by her husband's secrets?

124
00:21:24,521 --> 00:21:26,229
What do you want?

125
00:21:27,316 --> 00:21:28,395
Your help.

126
00:21:40,162 --> 00:21:41,573
One?

127
00:21:41,788 --> 00:21:44,825
I tell you, de la Vega,
women say they want one thing...

128
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,492
...but what they really want
is everything else.

129
00:21:48,962 --> 00:21:53,256
Think of this as a vacation
from the shackles of matrimony.

130
00:21:53,467 --> 00:21:55,258
Isn't it possible
our wives marry us...

131
00:21:55,469 --> 00:21:58,256
...because they want to spend
some time with their husbands?

132
00:22:02,392 --> 00:22:04,100
So let me understand this.

133
00:22:04,311 --> 00:22:05,722
If I take your advice...

134
00:22:05,937 --> 00:22:09,982
...I can look forward to spending my
days pruning in a tub of naked men?

135
00:22:12,611 --> 00:22:14,520
Thanks for the advice. But no.

136
00:22:16,072 --> 00:22:17,650
Where are you going?

137
00:22:18,033 --> 00:22:20,156
To beg Elena's forgiveness.

138
00:22:20,744 --> 00:22:22,286
Goodness me.

139
00:22:22,579 --> 00:22:25,615
Might one of you be
Don Alejandro de la Vega?

140
00:22:26,499 --> 00:22:27,495
Yes.

141
00:22:28,334 --> 00:22:33,127
Phineas Gendler, attorney at law.
I'm here on behalf of your wife.

142
00:22:33,339 --> 00:22:36,922
If you should have any questions,
my address is on the letterhead.

143
00:22:37,135 --> 00:22:38,463
Good day, sir.

144
00:22:38,678 --> 00:22:40,089
Gentlemen.

145
00:23:10,877 --> 00:23:11,956
I'm sorry, señor.

146
00:23:12,169 --> 00:23:15,621
But you told me to make sure
you didn't sleep past 2 today.

147
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:20,672
- What's today?
- Wednesday.

148
00:23:21,929 --> 00:23:24,503
Of course.
I have to pick up Joaquin.

149
00:23:26,642 --> 00:23:27,923
What happened to my clothes?

150
00:23:28,144 --> 00:23:31,678
I removed them last night
so you wouldn't catch pneumonia.

151
00:23:32,231 --> 00:23:33,642
You removed them?

152
00:23:33,858 --> 00:23:37,689
After you came back from the cantina,
you went for a swim.

153
00:23:38,863 --> 00:23:39,942
In my clothes?

154
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:45,109
- This hotel doesn't have a pool.
- We have a fountain.

155
00:23:46,912 --> 00:23:49,699
I see. Well, thank you, Lupe.

156
00:23:49,915 --> 00:23:52,121
Perhaps you just can
turn around, eh?

157
00:23:59,383 --> 00:24:01,126
I'll see you at confession, my child.

158
00:24:04,805 --> 00:24:07,557
Don't look at me like that.
I know what you're gonna say.

159
00:24:07,766 --> 00:24:11,016
No. No, I came here to lift
your spirits, not to dampen them.

160
00:24:11,228 --> 00:24:12,852
Who said my spirit needed lifting?

161
00:24:14,147 --> 00:24:16,473
Alejandro, you are being
a pig-headed fool.

162
00:24:16,692 --> 00:24:18,768
Why don't you just tell Elena
you were wrong.

163
00:24:18,986 --> 00:24:21,062
She's the one who wanted me
to live a lie.

164
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,904
To stop being myself.

165
00:24:23,115 --> 00:24:25,403
As if California could
live without me.

166
00:24:25,617 --> 00:24:28,286
Wake up. I haven't had to
ring that bell in three months.

167
00:24:28,495 --> 00:24:30,903
- You should be rejoicing.
- I am rejoicing!

168
00:24:31,123 --> 00:24:34,040
All right. You cannot
rot in this room forever.

169
00:24:34,251 --> 00:24:37,370
A vineyard is opening tonight.
You're coming to the party with me.

170
00:24:37,587 --> 00:24:39,959
My whole life is a party.
Thank you, no.

171
00:24:40,173 --> 00:24:41,502
Be at the lobby at 8.

172
00:24:41,716 --> 00:24:45,168
And don't bother coming to confession,
because I'll never forgive you.

173
00:24:46,262 --> 00:24:47,887
You'd blackmail my soul, eh?

174
00:24:49,307 --> 00:24:51,264
Hell, yes.

175
00:24:56,314 --> 00:25:00,063
Now, would anyone else
like to interrupt my lecture...

176
00:25:00,276 --> 00:25:03,028
...by asking to go to the bathroom?

177
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,489
No.

178
00:25:08,826 --> 00:25:10,784
Who can tell me
what this word means?

179
00:25:13,164 --> 00:25:14,789
Joaquin?

180
00:25:17,126 --> 00:25:19,249
Joaquin de la Vega!

181
00:25:22,006 --> 00:25:25,707
Perhaps you can tell the class
what statehood means to you.

182
00:25:28,471 --> 00:25:31,804
No more exploitation
of the peasants by the rich...

183
00:25:32,016 --> 00:25:35,966
...who oppress us
with a flaming poker of injustice.

184
00:25:36,187 --> 00:25:40,137
And how exactly does a flaming poker
fit into your little theory?

185
00:25:40,691 --> 00:25:42,269
It fits...

186
00:25:43,194 --> 00:25:44,818
...in your butt.

187
00:25:53,954 --> 00:25:56,492
Now I will give you something
to laugh about.

188
00:26:02,338 --> 00:26:03,666
Come here.

189
00:26:06,467 --> 00:26:08,091
No?

190
00:26:26,904 --> 00:26:29,359
Joaquin! Joaquin! Joaquin!

191
00:26:45,505 --> 00:26:47,545
Get back inside!

192
00:26:57,017 --> 00:26:58,511
Joaquin.

193
00:27:02,189 --> 00:27:03,599
So, what's with you, huh?

194
00:27:03,815 --> 00:27:06,602
You're lucky Father Quintero
didn't throw you out for good.

195
00:27:07,444 --> 00:27:10,895
Stop making excuses.
Why do you keep picking fights?

196
00:27:11,114 --> 00:27:14,150
You don't understand.
Sometimes you have to fight.

197
00:27:14,367 --> 00:27:16,360
Oh, really? Says who?

198
00:27:16,578 --> 00:27:17,776
Says him.

199
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:26,284
Listen, if Zorro were here, he'll tell you
fighting isn't always the answer.

200
00:27:26,796 --> 00:27:28,374
How do you know what he'd say?

201
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,915
Trust me, I know him a lot better
than you think.

202
00:27:31,134 --> 00:27:33,885
No, you don't.
You never been in a fight in your life.

203
00:27:34,095 --> 00:27:35,720
You didn't even fight to keep Mom.

204
00:27:36,556 --> 00:27:39,592
I am your father, little man.
Don't talk to me like that.

205
00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:43,593
There's nothing on earth I wouldn't do
for you or your mother. Understand?

206
00:27:44,105 --> 00:27:45,896
Don Alejandro.

207
00:27:46,482 --> 00:27:47,727
Don Alejandro.

208
00:27:48,484 --> 00:27:49,943
Guillermo.

209
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,316
- Blanca.
- Hello.

210
00:27:57,326 --> 00:27:59,449
Look at little José. Poor thing.

211
00:27:59,662 --> 00:28:01,619
He's as ugly as his mother.

212
00:28:02,164 --> 00:28:06,032
Look at Joaquin.
You're growing up so fast.

213
00:28:06,252 --> 00:28:10,036
If business keeps up, we'll be able to
pay you back sooner than we thought.

214
00:28:10,256 --> 00:28:12,961
I told you, it was a gift.
To celebrate your son's birth.

215
00:28:13,926 --> 00:28:17,295
Hey, señor.
That knife is only 2 dollars.

216
00:28:20,808 --> 00:28:23,381
Well, I'll give you 500 for it.

217
00:28:23,602 --> 00:28:27,137
And for that, I'll take the deed to your
rancho, with the Lord's gratitude.

218
00:28:27,356 --> 00:28:30,310
We've already told you,
we'll never sell.

219
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:36,608
Family man like you might wanna
keep his woman on a shorter leash.

220
00:28:37,199 --> 00:28:38,990
They said they are not selling, sir.

221
00:28:43,205 --> 00:28:45,494
Have we met before, sir?

222
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:49,082
I would remember a man
with wooden teeth.

223
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:53,129
And I'd remember a Mex-breed
dressed like a white man.

224
00:28:54,091 --> 00:28:57,294
You think your pappy's gonna crow,
little man? Or is he gonna cluck?

225
00:28:57,511 --> 00:28:58,507
Leave him out of...

226
00:29:04,268 --> 00:29:08,680
Señor, as a gentleman, I am obliged
to teach my son to turn the o...

227
00:29:09,606 --> 00:29:11,184
You mean that cheek?

228
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,858
Is everything all right, boys?

229
00:29:15,237 --> 00:29:17,063
Respects to you, officer.

230
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:19,187
Respects, respects.

231
00:29:22,786 --> 00:29:28,076
Think about my offer, or I'll
be obliged to do the Lord's work.

232
00:30:11,793 --> 00:30:14,165
Ten minutes, then I'm going.

233
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:18,004
Effervescent, yet tenacious.

234
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:20,541
I thought you were forbidden to drink.
What the...?

235
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,333
I need at least one vice
to keep in touch with sinners.

236
00:30:23,554 --> 00:30:25,761
Whatever.
Who owns this vineyard anyway?

237
00:30:25,973 --> 00:30:28,760
A count recently in from France.

238
00:30:28,976 --> 00:30:31,514
I'm told he purchased it
from Don Gallo's widow.

239
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:33,009
French count, you say?

240
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:35,852
He's probably still in his parlour
putting on makeup.

241
00:30:36,108 --> 00:30:38,017
Or his perfume, perhaps.

242
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,109
Rumour has it they invented it
to avoid bathing.

243
00:30:45,367 --> 00:30:46,363
And you are...?

244
00:30:47,828 --> 00:30:49,951
De la Vega. Alejandro de la Vega.

245
00:30:50,414 --> 00:30:52,323
You're de la Vega.

246
00:30:52,541 --> 00:30:55,376
What an honour.
I've heard so much about you.

247
00:30:55,586 --> 00:30:57,578
Really? From whom?

248
00:30:58,631 --> 00:31:01,168
You know, I'd love to
continue this conversation...

249
00:31:01,383 --> 00:31:04,218
...but I'm wanted elsewhere.
Please excuse me.

250
00:31:25,198 --> 00:31:27,321
I just met the most charming fellow.

251
00:31:27,534 --> 00:31:28,779
And who might that be?

252
00:31:29,161 --> 00:31:32,779
Ladies and gentlemen! Welcome.

253
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:35,615
I still don't know why
they call it a winetasting.

254
00:31:35,834 --> 00:31:37,827
After two glasses
you can't taste anything.

255
00:31:38,712 --> 00:31:41,832
Friends, Californians.

256
00:31:42,048 --> 00:31:46,924
This vineyard represents what I hope
will become an industry...

257
00:31:47,137 --> 00:31:50,173
...that depends on the people
for its success.

258
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:53,344
Involving them
instead of exploiting them.

259
00:31:57,731 --> 00:32:01,230
That's what America means to me.

260
00:32:01,443 --> 00:32:05,939
The promise of a country
by the people, for the people!

261
00:32:11,161 --> 00:32:14,695
A country blessed
with limitless beauty.

262
00:32:15,623 --> 00:32:19,206
But none more stunning
than my escort for the evening.

263
00:32:19,711 --> 00:32:21,371
Ladies and gentlemen...

264
00:32:21,588 --> 00:32:23,414
...Señora Elena de la Vega!

265
00:33:06,298 --> 00:33:08,754
Well, I'm pooped.
Come on, let's go.

266
00:33:08,968 --> 00:33:10,426
Go?

267
00:33:10,636 --> 00:33:14,586
I don't wanna go.
I'm having so much fun.

268
00:33:15,391 --> 00:33:18,095
Monsieur and Madame Lupon.

269
00:33:19,228 --> 00:33:20,556
- Pleasure, madame.
- Thank you.

270
00:33:21,105 --> 00:33:22,729
Very nice to meet you.

271
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:26,441
- Alejandro.
- Elena.

272
00:33:26,944 --> 00:33:29,435
- Armand.
- De la Vega.

273
00:33:30,489 --> 00:33:32,695
- Count.
- You know each other?

274
00:33:33,367 --> 00:33:36,119
We shared a giggle
at the buffet table.

275
00:33:36,328 --> 00:33:38,119
It seems that's not all
we have shared.

276
00:33:38,497 --> 00:33:41,664
Allow me to defuse
an awkward situation.

277
00:33:41,875 --> 00:33:44,662
Elena has portrayed you as a man
of impeccable character.

278
00:33:44,878 --> 00:33:46,752
I am honoured
to be mentioned at all.

279
00:33:46,964 --> 00:33:50,249
Why, I nearly forgot we were still
married only three months ago.

280
00:33:50,467 --> 00:33:52,460
A blessing on your vineyard, count.

281
00:33:52,678 --> 00:33:54,836
Thank you for inviting us,
but we have a Mass...

282
00:33:55,055 --> 00:33:58,720
Don't be rude, Felipe. I'm just dying
to know how the lovebirds met.

283
00:34:04,022 --> 00:34:07,687
Another time.
We have many guests to greet.

284
00:34:09,402 --> 00:34:10,778
Armand, good evening.

285
00:34:10,987 --> 00:34:13,941
Governor Riley.
You honour us with your presence.

286
00:34:14,157 --> 00:34:15,651
May I present my wife, Mary.

287
00:34:15,867 --> 00:34:18,275
Your speech was
incredibly moving, count.

288
00:34:18,495 --> 00:34:21,780
I'm glad you're not running for office
against my husband.

289
00:34:22,624 --> 00:34:25,957
I wouldn't challenge the man who's
going to lead California into the Union.

290
00:34:26,169 --> 00:34:29,585
I fear there may not be
much of a Union left to join, governor.

291
00:34:29,798 --> 00:34:31,755
Everyone, may I introduce...

292
00:34:31,966 --> 00:34:35,133
...Colonel R.S. Beauregard,
of the First Alabama Infantry.

293
00:34:35,345 --> 00:34:36,756
What brings you here, colonel?

294
00:34:36,971 --> 00:34:38,763
The threat of civil war, my dear.

295
00:34:38,973 --> 00:34:42,841
Once California joins the Union, the
Confederate states'll be outnumbered.

296
00:34:43,353 --> 00:34:45,760
My countrymen find that troubling.

297
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:49,598
All this talk of politics, you know how
it bores me, Armand. Shall we dance?

298
00:34:49,817 --> 00:34:52,059
Of course. Excuse us, gentlemen.

299
00:34:52,695 --> 00:34:55,732
Ladies and gentlemen,
the imperial quadrille.

300
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:07,866
Perhaps you shouldn't drink
on an empty stomach.

301
00:35:08,085 --> 00:35:11,086
Perhaps you should wear lipstick
if you're gonna act like my mother.

302
00:35:22,141 --> 00:35:24,050
Say the word
and I'll escort you home.

303
00:35:24,268 --> 00:35:26,308
- And leave your guests?
- In a heartbeat.

304
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:30,933
I care for you too much to subject you
to an evening of forced smiles, Elena.

305
00:35:33,694 --> 00:35:36,150
You. You are the one
not acting like yourself.

306
00:35:36,363 --> 00:35:37,858
Since when do politics bore you?

307
00:35:38,073 --> 00:35:40,611
Since when did you start caring
what I think?

308
00:35:41,744 --> 00:35:42,942
You.

309
00:35:46,415 --> 00:35:48,906
If you wish,
I'll have him escorted out.

310
00:35:49,126 --> 00:35:50,751
I can handle him.

311
00:35:52,046 --> 00:35:54,334
For the love of God,
let's get out of this place.

312
00:35:54,548 --> 00:35:56,042
I can handle her!

313
00:35:59,136 --> 00:36:01,045
You must tell me how you met.

314
00:36:01,263 --> 00:36:04,798
Years ago, in Spain. We were
at finishing school together.

315
00:36:05,017 --> 00:36:07,638
Oh, how nice.
You were reunited so he could finish.

316
00:36:07,853 --> 00:36:09,347
Don't force me to embarrass you.

317
00:36:09,563 --> 00:36:11,057
Sorry, too late!

318
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:21,065
So tell me, count, what does
your title rank among noblemen?

319
00:36:21,283 --> 00:36:23,074
It is higher than, say, a duke?

320
00:36:23,744 --> 00:36:26,910
Oh, it's rather common, actually.
Much like a don.

321
00:36:31,251 --> 00:36:35,379
Oh, he's a delight.
Rich, good-looking and royalty.

322
00:36:35,589 --> 00:36:37,249
What can I say
that'd make you leave?

323
00:36:37,465 --> 00:36:39,921
You can fall to your knees,
beg me to take you back.

324
00:36:40,135 --> 00:36:41,677
I wouldn't want to ruin my dress.

325
00:36:41,887 --> 00:36:45,053
- Good. I'm enjoying single life.
- That supposed to make me jealous?

326
00:36:45,265 --> 00:36:46,261
- Does it?
- Never!

327
00:36:46,474 --> 00:36:49,428
Who's looking after Joaquin while
his mother spends nights out?

328
00:36:49,644 --> 00:36:52,052
I have not spent nights out.
I haven't even told Joaquin!

329
00:36:52,272 --> 00:36:53,647
Now, I think you should go!

330
00:36:53,857 --> 00:36:55,019
- You know...
- Let me go!

331
00:36:55,233 --> 00:36:56,976
I finally understand
why you left me.

332
00:36:57,193 --> 00:36:59,565
It was beneath you to marry
a peasant like me.

333
00:36:59,779 --> 00:37:02,068
- You're drunk.
- Your stepfather would be proud...

334
00:37:02,282 --> 00:37:04,986
...to see you take your rightful place
on the arms of royalty!

335
00:37:05,201 --> 00:37:07,775
- Keep your voice down!
- Congratulations, Your Highness!

336
00:37:18,256 --> 00:37:23,214
If you didn't know me better than that,
then you never knew me at all.

337
00:37:39,485 --> 00:37:40,860
No.

338
00:37:43,698 --> 00:37:45,156
Thank you...

339
00:37:45,616 --> 00:37:48,866
...for your hospitality, count.

340
00:38:24,613 --> 00:38:27,186
Could you...? Could you...?
Could you...?

341
00:38:27,407 --> 00:38:29,234
Could you give me that back?

342
00:38:31,203 --> 00:38:34,654
Hey, hey! Cut it out!
You had enough.

343
00:38:38,627 --> 00:38:39,658
Stinky...

344
00:38:49,054 --> 00:38:52,257
Aren't you forgetting something,
estúpido?!

345
00:38:57,312 --> 00:38:59,352
Count Armand...

346
00:38:59,689 --> 00:39:04,019
...with his fancy wine
and the froufrou accent.

347
00:39:04,236 --> 00:39:06,857
How could Elena choose
a man like that?

348
00:39:07,197 --> 00:39:12,155
I'll make her want me back so badly,
she will be weeping with desire.

349
00:39:12,369 --> 00:39:16,449
Nobody leaves my tequila worm
dangling in the wind!

350
00:39:38,853 --> 00:39:40,561
Oh, my God.

351
00:40:12,011 --> 00:40:13,007
Thank you.

352
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:20,519
God bless you, señor.

353
00:40:21,395 --> 00:40:22,889
How kind of you.

354
00:40:23,564 --> 00:40:25,687
I was trying to impress you.

355
00:40:27,485 --> 00:40:32,443
If you truly want to impress me,
invite me over for dinner tonight.

356
00:40:32,948 --> 00:40:35,190
Cook me something sinful.

357
00:40:35,659 --> 00:40:39,194
Why not dine at your hacienda?
I'd really like to meet your son.

358
00:40:39,747 --> 00:40:41,620
Please try and understand, Armand.

359
00:40:41,832 --> 00:40:44,537
He's not ready for another man
in my life just yet.

360
00:40:44,835 --> 00:40:46,958
Of course. I understand.

361
00:40:48,255 --> 00:40:49,714
What is it?

362
00:40:51,216 --> 00:40:54,301
Oh, this hat. It's breathtaking.

363
00:40:57,264 --> 00:41:00,134
Shall I purchase it for you?

364
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:03,394
On second thought,
who needs another hat?

365
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:05,348
What I need is...

366
00:41:07,774 --> 00:41:08,889
...a pipe!

367
00:41:09,109 --> 00:41:10,389
- A pipe?
- A pipe.

368
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:12,235
Like my father used to smoke.

369
00:41:12,446 --> 00:41:15,233
I hope I do not repulse you
with my unladylike habit.

370
00:41:15,449 --> 00:41:18,153
No, no. On the contrary,
you fascinate me.

371
00:41:19,536 --> 00:41:21,196
Oh, there's a vendor.

372
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,694
Wait here, won't you?

373
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:30,415
What are you doing here?

374
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:32,208
When did you start
smoking a pipe?

375
00:41:32,424 --> 00:41:35,590
I don't smoke. I said it to
get rid of him so I can get rid of you.

376
00:41:35,802 --> 00:41:38,719
- I have to talk to you about last night.
- I forgive you. Bye.

377
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,887
No, no, no, not that. After.

378
00:41:41,224 --> 00:41:44,011
- I saw something in the forest.
- What are you talking about?

379
00:41:44,227 --> 00:41:46,765
Yes, what are you talking about?

380
00:41:48,481 --> 00:41:51,897
An explosion.
Close to your chateau, in fact.

381
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,770
Like nothing I have ever seen.

382
00:41:54,654 --> 00:41:57,940
I simply wanted to make sure
you were both safe.

383
00:41:58,324 --> 00:42:02,702
As much as you had to drink last night,
I'm sure your vision was impaired.

384
00:42:03,871 --> 00:42:05,864
Yet somehow
it's all becoming clear.

385
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:09,579
A word of advice, de la Vega:

386
00:42:10,128 --> 00:42:13,627
If you have any respect for the
relationship you shared with Elena...

387
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,631
...let it die with dignity.

388
00:42:16,217 --> 00:42:18,969
I have to know I am losing her
to a better man.

389
00:42:19,178 --> 00:42:20,293
I can assure you of that.

390
00:42:20,847 --> 00:42:22,804
All right, that is enough.

391
00:42:23,015 --> 00:42:25,471
- Alejandro, time to go.
- Elena, please.

392
00:42:26,811 --> 00:42:30,310
Alejandro has come for peace of mind.
I am obliged to give it to him.

393
00:42:30,856 --> 00:42:33,976
Perhaps we can settle this
like gentlemen.

394
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:36,980
You do play polo, I take it?

395
00:42:37,863 --> 00:42:39,192
Doesn't everyone?

396
00:42:39,448 --> 00:42:42,782
I suggest we play as they do
in Slovenia.

397
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:45,158
- A fine city.
- Country.

398
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,158
Naturally.

399
00:42:52,753 --> 00:42:56,122
- May I offer you something to drink?
- Double tequila, no salt.

400
00:43:13,857 --> 00:43:18,187
Perhaps a game of croquet would be
less hazardous to your health.

401
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:48,845
Did you drop something?
Or you just resting?

402
00:43:51,478 --> 00:43:53,102
You know, I think I like this game.

403
00:43:53,313 --> 00:43:55,638
Promise me when you lose
you will leave us alone.

404
00:43:55,857 --> 00:43:57,399
What makes you think I will lose?

405
00:43:57,859 --> 00:43:59,318
Woman's intuition.

406
00:44:43,237 --> 00:44:46,357
To the victor go the spoils.

407
00:44:50,536 --> 00:44:52,445
Now keep your promise and go.

408
00:44:52,663 --> 00:44:54,288
You cheated, so I take it back.

409
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:56,119
Goodbye, Alejandro.

410
00:44:56,334 --> 00:44:58,622
What do you really know
about this man?

411
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:04,628
We were never meant
to be together.

412
00:45:12,183 --> 00:45:13,974
You don't love him.

413
00:45:14,185 --> 00:45:18,134
After 10 years of marriage,
you cannot hide the truth from me.

414
00:45:31,535 --> 00:45:34,986
De la Cruz is the bartender who works
at the saloon across the street.

415
00:45:35,205 --> 00:45:39,333
He says he overheard McGivens
gathering his men to go see Cortez.

416
00:46:34,013 --> 00:46:35,887
Your father asked me to pick...

417
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:08,790
Cortez!

418
00:47:14,136 --> 00:47:16,924
The deed, if you please.

419
00:47:40,996 --> 00:47:43,072
- Bring it here.
- No, Guillermo, don't!

420
00:47:43,874 --> 00:47:46,958
Please, señor.
This land is all we have.

421
00:47:47,169 --> 00:47:51,297
And the Lord shall expel them
before you...

422
00:47:51,507 --> 00:47:54,211
...and ye shall possess their land!

423
00:47:59,848 --> 00:48:01,011
Salvation...

424
00:48:01,642 --> 00:48:02,887
...damnation.

425
00:48:03,102 --> 00:48:07,479
Got one thing in common.
You gotta die to find either one.

426
00:48:07,689 --> 00:48:09,065
How true.

427
00:48:12,361 --> 00:48:13,938
Drop your guns.

428
00:48:16,281 --> 00:48:17,989
All of you!

429
00:48:24,039 --> 00:48:25,830
Guillermo, Blanca, get in the house.

430
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:37,839
You are one blind Mexican. You don't
know what you're getting yourself into.

431
00:48:38,887 --> 00:48:40,132
Neither do you.

432
00:48:46,728 --> 00:48:48,103
Shoot him!

433
00:48:48,313 --> 00:48:50,187
Let him be!

434
00:49:01,743 --> 00:49:04,032
- Come on!
- Let's move!

435
00:49:38,738 --> 00:49:40,232
Don't let them hurt you.

436
00:49:40,448 --> 00:49:42,357
I won't. I promise.

437
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:07,931
Go on! Break it down!

438
00:52:04,966 --> 00:52:06,376
Blanca.

439
00:52:06,717 --> 00:52:08,046
Blanca.

440
00:52:38,958 --> 00:52:41,365
No! Guillermo!

441
00:52:42,961 --> 00:52:47,090
Guillermo! Guillermo.

442
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,342
Guillermo.

443
00:52:49,551 --> 00:52:51,959
Guillermo, please talk to me.

444
00:52:54,556 --> 00:52:56,300
Talk to me!

445
00:52:56,517 --> 00:52:57,762
Please!

446
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:21,119
What are you trying to tell me, huh?

447
00:53:21,333 --> 00:53:23,954
No matter what choice I make,
it's always the wrong one!

448
00:53:24,169 --> 00:53:25,960
I have failed everyone I ever loved.

449
00:53:26,171 --> 00:53:28,377
My wife, my son
and now the people too!

450
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:30,214
What do you want from me?!

451
00:53:43,313 --> 00:53:44,807
Help me.

452
00:53:45,356 --> 00:53:48,026
I have always listened to my heart.

453
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:51,565
And it speaks to me now
of a great darkness.

454
00:53:52,864 --> 00:53:55,236
I fear Guillermo Cortez
was only the beginning...

455
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:57,489
...and that Elena
is in great danger too.

456
00:53:58,494 --> 00:54:00,202
So I beg you...

457
00:54:01,164 --> 00:54:04,580
...give me the courage,
the strength...

458
00:54:05,209 --> 00:54:07,831
...to wear the mask a little longer.

459
00:54:09,422 --> 00:54:11,995
Allow Zorro one last ride.

460
00:54:51,881 --> 00:54:52,876
Come here.

461
00:55:02,474 --> 00:55:04,384
She's going to the vineyard.

462
00:55:05,102 --> 00:55:07,558
We can post men at the gate
in case we have to pull her out.

463
00:55:07,938 --> 00:55:11,354
If she's compromised,
she's of no further use.

464
00:55:11,942 --> 00:55:14,860
Consider her an acceptable loss.

465
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:42,795
Master, a word?

466
00:55:43,849 --> 00:55:46,470
Please, excuse me a moment.

467
00:55:50,856 --> 00:55:54,022
The shipment arrives
at Maderas Cove.

468
00:56:06,454 --> 00:56:08,826
The carving is beautiful.

469
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:11,289
And what is through that door?

470
00:56:12,043 --> 00:56:13,621
Private chapel.

471
00:56:14,003 --> 00:56:17,455
Piety is a long-standing tradition
in my family.

472
00:56:17,674 --> 00:56:20,628
I'd show it to you,
but dinner's waiting.

473
00:56:40,405 --> 00:56:42,777
That was absolutely delicious.

474
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,029
And now...

475
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:49,204
Oh, no, I'm sorry, Marie,
I do not smoke.

476
00:56:50,915 --> 00:56:53,999
Unless it is my pipe, of course.

477
00:56:56,712 --> 00:57:00,164
Oh, you remembered.
How thoughtful.

478
00:57:01,133 --> 00:57:04,087
But I think I should let
my stomach settle first.

479
00:57:07,056 --> 00:57:08,467
Elena.

480
00:57:09,725 --> 00:57:12,014
I want to ask you something.

481
00:57:12,895 --> 00:57:15,516
Something I should've asked you
many years ago.

482
00:57:16,398 --> 00:57:21,191
Before you do, my love,
answer me one question.

483
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:23,479
Whatever your heart desires.

484
00:57:25,241 --> 00:57:29,285
Where is the bathroom?
I would like to powder my cheeks.

485
00:57:31,121 --> 00:57:34,075
Of course. Down the hall.

486
00:57:34,583 --> 00:57:36,077
Excuse me.

487
00:58:10,911 --> 00:58:14,529
Excuse me, sir.
A gentleman is here to see you.

488
00:58:15,832 --> 00:58:17,624
He says it's important.

489
00:59:11,179 --> 00:59:13,634
He's building a track
to the vineyard.

490
00:59:20,855 --> 00:59:23,180
I presume you have the deed...

491
00:59:23,399 --> 00:59:26,151
...since you deemed it necessary
to interrupt my dinner.

492
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:27,641
Right here.

493
00:59:27,862 --> 00:59:30,187
But it seems we have
a fly in the ointment.

494
00:59:30,406 --> 00:59:32,612
Or should I say a fox. Zorro.

495
00:59:33,159 --> 00:59:35,198
I've heard the name
among the locals.

496
00:59:35,411 --> 00:59:38,827
He's a peasant masquerading
as a folk hero.

497
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:42,375
Men like that usually find their way
to the guillotine.

498
00:59:51,302 --> 00:59:54,884
I've been informed one of my
shipping vessels is arriving tomorrow.

499
00:59:55,097 --> 00:59:57,220
They'll anchor off Maderas Cove.

500
00:59:57,433 --> 01:00:00,683
The cargo must be
brought here safely.

501
01:00:01,562 --> 01:00:03,519
I want no mistakes.

502
01:00:21,373 --> 01:00:26,201
Now that we have the deed,
will the track be completed on time?

503
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:29,374
Lt'll take my boys two days
to cover the quarter mile.

504
01:00:29,923 --> 01:00:34,466
I'll hold you to that, Mr. McGivens.
Otherwise you get nothing.

505
01:00:36,930 --> 01:00:39,219
Listen to me,
you backwards-ass frog...

506
01:00:39,432 --> 01:00:41,888
...you hedge on my money,
you won't ever see me co...

507
01:00:46,314 --> 01:00:49,066
This dagger, Mr. McGivens...

508
01:00:49,734 --> 01:00:50,897
...Jake...

509
01:00:51,111 --> 01:00:53,150
...has been in my family
for generations.

510
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:56,900
If you ever talk to me
like that again...

511
01:00:57,117 --> 01:01:01,410
...I will cut out your tongue
and I'll feed it to my dogs.

512
01:01:02,622 --> 01:01:04,033
Understood?

513
01:01:14,968 --> 01:01:17,968
Your men have two days,
Mr. McGivens...

514
01:01:18,179 --> 01:01:20,337
...then the future begins.

515
01:01:21,474 --> 01:01:23,716
I trust you can find
your own way out.

516
01:01:42,161 --> 01:01:44,782
"Orbis unum."

517
01:03:06,953 --> 01:03:09,575
Alejandro! For God's sake,
why can't you leave me alone?

518
01:03:09,789 --> 01:03:12,993
Elena, I was right.
Armand is not who you think he is.

519
01:03:13,209 --> 01:03:15,665
- You have no idea who I think he is.
- I think I know.

520
01:03:15,879 --> 01:03:18,833
No, because you do not think.
Get out before somebody sees you.

521
01:03:19,049 --> 01:03:20,377
Elena, listen to me.

522
01:03:20,592 --> 01:03:23,261
- Guillermo Cortez is dead.
- What?

523
01:03:23,470 --> 01:03:25,462
Armand needed his land
to build a railroad.

524
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,222
He's planning something.

525
01:03:27,432 --> 01:03:28,974
How do you know this?

526
01:03:29,184 --> 01:03:32,469
Oh, no. I won't tell you what I know
until you tell me what you know.

527
01:03:32,687 --> 01:03:36,436
If you wanna know, I need to know why
you are living in sin with an evil count!

528
01:03:36,649 --> 01:03:37,645
Elena?

529
01:03:40,612 --> 01:03:42,189
Elena?

530
01:03:49,787 --> 01:03:51,198
There you are.

531
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:59,043
Forgive me, Armand. I just had the
sudden urge to step out for a puff.

532
01:04:01,966 --> 01:04:03,425
Are you all right?

533
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:05,172
Fine.

534
01:04:05,386 --> 01:04:07,046
My God, you're turning green.

535
01:04:08,723 --> 01:04:13,764
It's just your presence
takes my breath away.

536
01:04:15,604 --> 01:04:21,191
Good, because I have
a little something for you.

537
01:04:21,819 --> 01:04:24,939
A customary Spanish offering...

538
01:04:25,990 --> 01:04:30,070
...for when a man asks a woman
for her hand in marriage.

539
01:04:35,291 --> 01:04:38,126
Let me do this on one knee
so I can look up into your eyes.

540
01:04:38,335 --> 01:04:39,450
Oh, no, don't look up.

541
01:04:53,809 --> 01:04:55,303
Is that a yes?

542
01:04:55,519 --> 01:04:57,262
It's a definite maybe.

543
01:04:57,479 --> 01:05:01,180
I know it's sudden, given what
you've just been through...

544
01:05:02,067 --> 01:05:07,025
...but I want to give you everything
your former husband couldn't.

545
01:05:07,906 --> 01:05:09,946
You don't have to answer now...

546
01:05:11,451 --> 01:05:15,319
...but whatever you decide,
the necklace is yours.

547
01:05:16,248 --> 01:05:17,659
Thank you.

548
01:05:18,959 --> 01:05:22,956
But I have to go.
I must put Joaquin to bed.

549
01:05:23,964 --> 01:05:28,341
Of course.
Your children require attention.

550
01:05:44,484 --> 01:05:45,647
Pearls.

551
01:06:14,639 --> 01:06:18,423
Welcome, children, to Bear Point.

552
01:06:18,726 --> 01:06:20,933
It was on this desolate spot...

553
01:06:21,145 --> 01:06:24,728
...that our state flag
was raised for the first time.

554
01:06:24,941 --> 01:06:28,689
Tomorrow our governor will be
hosting a celebration here...

555
01:06:28,903 --> 01:06:31,394
...to honour California's statehood.

556
01:06:31,614 --> 01:06:33,939
Joaquin de la Vega!

557
01:06:34,158 --> 01:06:35,901
Are you paying attention?

558
01:06:38,287 --> 01:06:40,244
Take out your notebooks...

559
01:06:54,762 --> 01:06:56,090
Hold up.

560
01:07:14,448 --> 01:07:16,571
Scorcher of a day, ain't it, kids?

561
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:26,708
Is there something
I can help you with, señor?

562
01:07:27,294 --> 01:07:29,832
Don't let me interrupt
the lesson, Father.

563
01:07:30,047 --> 01:07:32,834
I'm just on my way
to do the Lord's work.

564
01:07:34,968 --> 01:07:36,462
Mount up, boys.

565
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:42,433
Come on.

566
01:08:17,385 --> 01:08:19,176
Grab that there, will you?

567
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:49,081
Let's get to work, boys.

568
01:09:33,919 --> 01:09:35,082
What are you doing here?

569
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:39,086
Looking at two of the ugliest guys
I've ever seen.

570
01:09:55,065 --> 01:09:56,773
Come on.
Do you want a piece of me?

571
01:10:44,364 --> 01:10:45,822
Stay there!

572
01:10:53,623 --> 01:10:55,829
Orbis unum.

573
01:11:17,271 --> 01:11:20,687
I can't believe it's you.
You're really Zorro.

574
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:22,394
And that's Tornado, right?

575
01:11:22,610 --> 01:11:26,145
I mean, whoa.
Look at him. He's huge.

576
01:11:31,077 --> 01:11:32,487
It's just a scratch.

577
01:11:34,955 --> 01:11:37,197
So you gonna say something
or what?

578
01:11:37,958 --> 01:11:40,414
Let's speak in Spanish,
the language of our fathers.

579
01:11:40,628 --> 01:11:42,454
My mother won't believe this!

580
01:11:42,922 --> 01:11:46,041
No, it would be better if you didn't
tell your mother about this.

581
01:11:46,258 --> 01:11:47,456
Why not?

582
01:11:48,427 --> 01:11:49,969
I'm the one asking the questions.

583
01:11:50,179 --> 01:11:51,590
Now, why aren't you in school?

584
01:11:51,805 --> 01:11:53,715
The man with the scar on his face.

585
01:11:53,933 --> 01:11:55,427
I knew he was up to something.

586
01:11:55,643 --> 01:11:57,552
You really showed that son of a bitch.

587
01:11:57,978 --> 01:12:00,018
Watch your mouth.

588
01:12:01,065 --> 01:12:02,607
Those men are killers.

589
01:12:02,816 --> 01:12:05,058
Whatever they had in those crates
was very dangerous...

590
01:12:05,277 --> 01:12:08,064
...and now I don't know what it was, as I
was too busy getting you out of trouble.

591
01:12:11,283 --> 01:12:12,861
You mean this?

592
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:17,908
Soap?!

593
01:12:18,790 --> 01:12:19,822
That's all there was?

594
01:12:20,042 --> 01:12:21,121
Lots and lots of it.

595
01:12:21,335 --> 01:12:22,414
Are you sure?

596
01:12:22,628 --> 01:12:24,252
Would I lie to you?

597
01:12:27,507 --> 01:12:30,378
Spanish, niño, Spanish,
and this isn't a game.

598
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:33,720
Your father would have a heart attack
if he knew what you did.

599
01:12:34,306 --> 01:12:36,263
No, he wouldn't, he doesn't care.

600
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:39,841
Yesterday he forgot about me.

601
01:12:43,481 --> 01:12:45,557
No, I don't think he forgot.

602
01:12:46,568 --> 01:12:49,355
What you have to understand is...

603
01:12:52,282 --> 01:12:53,657
No.

604
01:12:54,451 --> 01:12:56,443
Your father should have been there.

605
01:12:57,412 --> 01:12:58,990
Next time he will be.

606
01:12:59,205 --> 01:13:00,949
How do you know?

607
01:13:03,126 --> 01:13:04,585
I know.

608
01:13:05,336 --> 01:13:06,332
I promise.

609
01:13:18,182 --> 01:13:20,673
A serpent circling the globe.

610
01:13:21,269 --> 01:13:23,974
Are you sure that this is the symbol
you saw on the crate?

611
01:13:26,441 --> 01:13:27,686
"Orbis unum." Yeah.

612
01:13:28,067 --> 01:13:30,819
It's Latin. It means "one world."

613
01:13:31,362 --> 01:13:33,485
It represents
the Knights of Aragon...

614
01:13:33,698 --> 01:13:37,197
...an ancient brotherhood that ruled
Europe in secrecy after the Crusades.

615
01:13:37,410 --> 01:13:40,115
Wait, wait, wait.
Armand is a knight?

616
01:13:42,039 --> 01:13:44,993
Some believe they are the masters
behind the kings in Europe...

617
01:13:45,209 --> 01:13:46,751
...even today.

618
01:13:47,712 --> 01:13:51,330
Here is a prophecy they wrote
nearly 1000 years ago.

619
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:55,716
"There shall be a land in the west
of great power...

620
01:13:55,928 --> 01:13:59,214
...that shall rise to threaten
the serpent.

621
01:13:59,432 --> 01:14:03,928
Only by turning the power onto itself
shall the serpent survive."

622
01:14:06,897 --> 01:14:08,605
A land in the west.

623
01:14:09,233 --> 01:14:10,644
America.

624
01:14:12,027 --> 01:14:13,854
They want to destroy it.

625
01:14:15,406 --> 01:14:16,948
- With the soap?
- With the soap?

626
01:14:31,255 --> 01:14:32,535
Thank you.

627
01:14:33,715 --> 01:14:35,625
I had a wonderful time.

628
01:14:35,843 --> 01:14:38,049
Unfortunate that it has to end.

629
01:14:38,262 --> 01:14:39,637
It does?

630
01:14:39,846 --> 01:14:43,298
Some colleagues of mine are arriving
from Europe this evening.

631
01:14:43,517 --> 01:14:45,059
The meeting may run late.

632
01:14:46,687 --> 01:14:49,723
Perhaps we could meet
for breakfast?

633
01:14:51,274 --> 01:14:52,473
I cannot wait that long.

634
01:14:54,111 --> 01:14:56,399
I want to be your wife, Armand.

635
01:15:11,044 --> 01:15:13,500
If I am going to be
the lady of the house...

636
01:15:13,713 --> 01:15:16,418
...I want to start making myself
at home.

637
01:15:19,302 --> 01:15:23,929
I suppose we could have
a late supper.

638
01:15:26,476 --> 01:15:28,931
I will wait for you after your meeting.

639
01:15:30,146 --> 01:15:33,266
Then perhaps I can stay.

640
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:35,788
Excuse me.

641
01:16:44,053 --> 01:16:47,303
Sir! Sir! Hotel Vista Grande.

642
01:16:51,810 --> 01:16:53,304
What the...?

643
01:17:13,623 --> 01:17:14,703
Who are you?

644
01:17:15,083 --> 01:17:17,455
I'm Agent Pike.
This is Agent Harrigan.

645
01:17:17,919 --> 01:17:21,371
We're the Pinkertons. Operatives
of the United States government.

646
01:17:22,591 --> 01:17:24,215
So you are the good guys?

647
01:17:24,426 --> 01:17:27,047
We live in perilous times,
Mr. De la Vega.

648
01:17:27,262 --> 01:17:29,670
America's gates have been
thrown wide open...

649
01:17:29,890 --> 01:17:31,514
...to people from foreign lands.

650
01:17:31,725 --> 01:17:34,512
Which is why, on occasion,
we require certain individuals...

651
01:17:34,728 --> 01:17:37,301
...to aid in our country's defence.

652
01:17:37,522 --> 01:17:38,897
People like your ex-wife.

653
01:17:42,277 --> 01:17:43,736
Elena?

654
01:17:47,532 --> 01:17:49,026
Works for you?

655
01:17:50,493 --> 01:17:51,738
As a spy?

656
01:17:52,412 --> 01:17:54,737
Until California's statehood
becomes official...

657
01:17:54,956 --> 01:17:57,743
...we don't have jurisdiction to serve
Armand with a search warrant.

658
01:17:57,959 --> 01:18:00,082
So we needed someone
who could gain his trust.

659
01:18:00,295 --> 01:18:03,414
And who more suited to the task
than the woman he never forgot?

660
01:18:03,631 --> 01:18:05,624
Before he arrived,
we intercepted a telegram...

661
01:18:05,842 --> 01:18:08,415
...he'd dispatched to his associates
throughout Europe.

662
01:18:08,636 --> 01:18:12,764
In that telegram, he claimed to be on
the verge of producing a new weapon...

663
01:18:12,974 --> 01:18:15,216
...with a single target in mind.

664
01:18:15,518 --> 01:18:17,760
The United States of America.

665
01:18:20,022 --> 01:18:22,395
What kind of weapon could do that?

666
01:18:22,608 --> 01:18:25,278
Your ex-wife may be on the verge
to answer that question.

667
01:18:25,486 --> 01:18:29,104
And every time you interfere, you
jeopardize her cover. Understand?

668
01:18:31,993 --> 01:18:34,199
The divorce was your idea,
wasn't it?

669
01:18:34,412 --> 01:18:37,366
You blackmailed Elena
to lure in the count...

670
01:18:37,581 --> 01:18:41,116
We prefer to think of it
as a mutual understanding.

671
01:18:41,502 --> 01:18:43,245
She agrees to help us...

672
01:18:43,462 --> 01:18:47,542
...and we promise to keep the name
of Zorro secret from his enemies.

673
01:18:47,758 --> 01:18:50,795
A name you share
with your wife and son.

674
01:18:58,894 --> 01:19:01,101
I know something
that might help you.

675
01:19:20,082 --> 01:19:22,834
I will send you both to hell for this!

676
01:19:24,461 --> 01:19:28,506
Our country must be protected,
de la Vega, without apology.

677
01:19:29,550 --> 01:19:31,589
Zorro is a relic of the past.

678
01:19:32,803 --> 01:19:34,795
This belongs in a museum.

679
01:19:35,514 --> 01:19:37,138
So do you.

680
01:19:43,647 --> 01:19:45,889
Soon we will both be free.

681
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:42,031
Bonsoir, Marie.
Armand is expecting me.

682
01:20:42,246 --> 01:20:45,532
You are early, madame.
The count is still indisposed.

683
01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:48,585
Well, perhaps I can wait
in the parlour.

684
01:21:00,348 --> 01:21:02,091
Thank you so much, Marie.

685
01:21:39,678 --> 01:21:42,299
Joaquin? Joaquin!

686
01:21:42,806 --> 01:21:44,633
Hey! Hey! Come here.

687
01:21:45,350 --> 01:21:46,346
Dad?

688
01:21:50,814 --> 01:21:52,143
What are you doing in a bar?

689
01:21:52,357 --> 01:21:54,480
- What are you doing in jail?
- I asked you first.

690
01:21:54,693 --> 01:21:57,065
I went looking everywhere for you.
It's about mom.

691
01:21:57,279 --> 01:22:00,196
- Is she okay?
- No. I mean, yes, but no.

692
01:22:00,407 --> 01:22:01,735
A man came to the house.

693
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:04,157
He asked her to marry him.
She said yes.

694
01:22:04,369 --> 01:22:07,489
I know you still love her.
You said you'd do anything for her.

695
01:22:07,706 --> 01:22:11,406
You can't be in jail! How can you be
in jail?! You gotta stop her.

696
01:22:11,626 --> 01:22:13,370
Joaquin. Joaquin, listen to me.

697
01:22:13,587 --> 01:22:17,834
Help me out of here,
and I'll get your mother back.

698
01:22:19,092 --> 01:22:20,966
We'll be a family again.

699
01:22:22,596 --> 01:22:24,304
I promise.

700
01:22:27,058 --> 01:22:30,178
I promise. Now...

701
01:23:21,946 --> 01:23:25,362
Joaquin. Joaquin.
You are a genius, a genius.

702
01:23:25,574 --> 01:23:28,575
But I don't want to catch you
breaking anyone out of jail again.

703
01:23:28,786 --> 01:23:30,660
Without my permission, I mean.

704
01:23:52,309 --> 01:23:55,014
Stay back! Or I break the kid's neck!

705
01:23:55,229 --> 01:24:00,104
Help me! I'm too young to die!
I got my whole life ahead of me!

706
01:24:03,070 --> 01:24:04,529
Kill him.

707
01:24:21,338 --> 01:24:23,129
Where did you learn to do that?

708
01:24:24,633 --> 01:24:27,385
Prison changes a man, son.
Let's go.

709
01:24:47,822 --> 01:24:49,482
Listen, Joaquin.

710
01:24:50,533 --> 01:24:52,407
- I have to go alone.
- What?

711
01:24:52,744 --> 01:24:54,618
I just got you out of jail!

712
01:24:54,829 --> 01:24:56,110
What if he puts up a fight?

713
01:24:56,331 --> 01:24:59,118
I'm not going there to fight.
I am going to reason with him.

714
01:24:59,334 --> 01:25:00,532
You can't reason with him.

715
01:25:00,752 --> 01:25:03,788
Joaquin, the world is a little more
complicated than you think.

716
01:25:04,005 --> 01:25:05,832
No, it isn't.
There's right and wrong.

717
01:25:06,049 --> 01:25:09,003
I don't have the time
to argue with you.

718
01:25:11,054 --> 01:25:12,714
I'm sorry.

719
01:25:13,515 --> 01:25:15,139
Come, Joaquincito.

720
01:25:19,103 --> 01:25:21,511
You don't deserve Mom.

721
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:46,126
Yeah. We're to stay put.

722
01:27:08,753 --> 01:27:10,793
Armand went through there.
We have to hurry.

723
01:27:11,006 --> 01:27:12,998
- I know about the Pinkertons.
- How?

724
01:27:13,216 --> 01:27:15,043
Doesn't matter.
They told me everything.

725
01:27:15,260 --> 01:27:16,719
It's all right, I forgive you.

726
01:27:16,928 --> 01:27:18,921
You forgive me? No, no.
I forgive you. You!

727
01:27:19,139 --> 01:27:20,799
- For what?
- Everything you put me through.

728
01:27:21,016 --> 01:27:24,301
You? I would not be in this mess
if you had kept your mask on.

729
01:27:24,519 --> 01:27:26,761
Really? Why are you
still wearing his necklace?

730
01:27:26,980 --> 01:27:28,474
I'm undercover.

731
01:27:28,690 --> 01:27:32,059
Besides, these are pearls.
You never gave me pearls.

732
01:27:32,277 --> 01:27:35,443
- You said you didn't care.
- I lied. Every woman loves pearls.

733
01:27:35,655 --> 01:27:37,564
Well, now you have them, princess.

734
01:27:38,074 --> 01:27:41,443
When I said that we were never
meant to be together, I meant it.

735
01:27:41,869 --> 01:27:43,827
Finally we agree on something.

736
01:27:54,549 --> 01:27:57,715
- This changes nothing.
- Absolutely not.

737
01:27:58,886 --> 01:28:01,638
- Follow me.
- Always.

738
01:28:09,230 --> 01:28:10,428
Orbis unum.

739
01:28:11,023 --> 01:28:12,767
Orbis unum.

740
01:28:13,067 --> 01:28:15,523
Fellow Knights of Aragon...

741
01:28:16,070 --> 01:28:21,491
...soon the power of the United States
will be so great...

742
01:28:22,076 --> 01:28:24,863
...it will overshadow us.

743
01:28:26,247 --> 01:28:30,327
But America has one weakness:

744
01:28:32,211 --> 01:28:33,491
Lts people.

745
01:28:34,505 --> 01:28:37,210
They are divided,
by north and south.

746
01:28:37,424 --> 01:28:40,212
A civil war is inevitable.

747
01:28:40,427 --> 01:28:43,547
The only question is,
who will claim victory?

748
01:28:44,390 --> 01:28:47,556
We will determine the outcome...

749
01:28:50,270 --> 01:28:51,350
...with this:

750
01:28:52,481 --> 01:28:54,059
An average bar of soap.

751
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:58,067
Quite harmless in its current form.

752
01:28:58,612 --> 01:29:03,737
But science has shown us
how to extract the glycerine...

753
01:29:04,368 --> 01:29:06,693
...and transform it
into a compound...

754
01:29:06,912 --> 01:29:10,577
...13 times more powerful
than gunpowder.

755
01:29:13,752 --> 01:29:15,330
Nitroglycerine.

756
01:29:18,048 --> 01:29:22,259
For months, this vineyard has been
a cover for its manufacture.

757
01:29:23,095 --> 01:29:26,546
Tomorrow, a shipment of nitro
will depart by train.

758
01:29:26,765 --> 01:29:29,719
It will be met at the state line
by Colonel Beauregard...

759
01:29:30,018 --> 01:29:32,141
...who will take possession
of the shipment...

760
01:29:32,354 --> 01:29:35,770
...and distribute it throughout
the Confederate Army.

761
01:29:36,316 --> 01:29:37,775
As we speak...

762
01:29:38,068 --> 01:29:39,610
...they're preparing to launch...

763
01:29:39,819 --> 01:29:42,441
...a pre-emptive strike
against Washington...

764
01:29:42,989 --> 01:29:46,773
...forever tearing this country apart.

765
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:53,248
Gentlemen, the Knights of Aragon...

766
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:56,619
...will soon be restored
to our former glory...

767
01:29:56,836 --> 01:30:01,130
...as we stand in shadow and watch
America destroy itself!

768
01:30:01,674 --> 01:30:02,754
I've heard enough.

769
01:30:04,302 --> 01:30:06,627
Brothers, you know
my spirit is with you.

770
01:30:06,846 --> 01:30:09,930
But we risk antagonizing
a sleeping giant if we fail.

771
01:30:11,726 --> 01:30:12,805
I'll see myself out.

772
01:30:22,779 --> 01:30:24,486
Lord Dillingham.

773
01:30:27,241 --> 01:30:30,776
Would a demonstration
put your mind at ease?

774
01:31:00,524 --> 01:31:02,813
Unless you come to confess...

775
01:31:03,027 --> 01:31:05,518
...you have no business here,
McGivens.

776
01:31:05,738 --> 01:31:08,359
Funny you should mention
confession, padre...

777
01:31:08,574 --> 01:31:11,694
...seeing that you're obliged to keep
the secrets of your flock.

778
01:31:13,912 --> 01:31:15,822
Joaquincito, go back inside!

779
01:31:21,336 --> 01:31:22,712
Who's Zorro?

780
01:31:23,797 --> 01:31:26,549
You know, Zorro could be
anyone at all.

781
01:31:27,843 --> 01:31:29,551
Come on, now.

782
01:31:30,262 --> 01:31:32,551
We're both men of God.

783
01:31:36,184 --> 01:31:37,844
You can tell me.

784
01:31:38,395 --> 01:31:39,391
Hey, boss.

785
01:31:51,116 --> 01:31:52,907
Lord hates a liar.

786
01:31:54,411 --> 01:31:56,736
All right, I'll tell you.

787
01:31:58,957 --> 01:32:00,368
Run!

788
01:32:14,472 --> 01:32:17,094
Felipe! You killed Felipe!

789
01:32:42,583 --> 01:32:44,078
Gentlemen...

790
01:32:44,711 --> 01:32:45,706
...the future.

791
01:33:18,619 --> 01:33:22,617
This facility will provide
a continuous supply of nitro...

792
01:33:23,082 --> 01:33:25,039
...to the Southern battlefront.

793
01:33:25,251 --> 01:33:27,208
I'll be returning to Europe shortly...

794
01:33:27,419 --> 01:33:30,954
...but Ferroq will remain
to oversee the operation.

795
01:33:32,341 --> 01:33:35,258
The nitro has been concealed
in these bottles...

796
01:33:35,469 --> 01:33:38,672
...to circumvent any prying
Northern patrol.

797
01:33:46,939 --> 01:33:50,936
An urgent matter requires
your attention at the hacienda.

798
01:33:56,949 --> 01:33:58,988
He's going back to the hacienda.

799
01:33:59,201 --> 01:34:02,784
- I have to get back before he does.
- I'll keep the train from leaving. Go.

800
01:34:02,996 --> 01:34:05,618
Elena. Be careful.

801
01:35:55,566 --> 01:35:56,562
Armand.

802
01:35:57,526 --> 01:36:02,402
My goodness, I must have dozed off
and your dogs startled me.

803
01:36:03,741 --> 01:36:06,314
Perhaps they thought
you were someone you're not.

804
01:36:08,412 --> 01:36:10,369
I'm told you arrived early.

805
01:36:10,706 --> 01:36:12,283
I could not wait.

806
01:36:12,499 --> 01:36:14,824
I'm having a special meal prepared.

807
01:36:15,419 --> 01:36:16,747
I hope you're hungry.

808
01:36:17,212 --> 01:36:19,169
I'm famished.

809
01:36:27,306 --> 01:36:28,930
Thank you, Marie.

810
01:36:32,728 --> 01:36:34,435
You are not hungry?

811
01:36:52,122 --> 01:36:53,746
Tasty, is it?

812
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,375
It's unusual.

813
01:36:57,419 --> 01:36:58,699
Is it quail?

814
01:37:00,588 --> 01:37:01,668
Pigeon.

815
01:37:31,285 --> 01:37:33,408
As you said, Elena...

816
01:37:34,247 --> 01:37:37,366
...we see the people we love
as we wish them to be...

817
01:37:37,583 --> 01:37:39,706
...not as who they really are.

818
01:37:46,092 --> 01:37:47,752
Did you actually think...

819
01:37:47,969 --> 01:37:51,551
...that I would be swept off my feet
by a sadistic coward like you?

820
01:37:52,932 --> 01:37:55,257
I thought you were
a woman of vision.

821
01:37:55,810 --> 01:37:59,807
"Vision." I could barely stomach
the sight of you, Armand.

822
01:38:00,022 --> 01:38:03,356
The only way I could bear your touch
was to imagine you were Alejandro.

823
01:38:06,403 --> 01:38:08,776
Your stepfather would be ashamed.

824
01:38:09,698 --> 01:38:12,699
You've become nothing more
than a common woman...

825
01:38:12,993 --> 01:38:15,401
...devoted to a common man.

826
01:38:16,121 --> 01:38:18,659
I take that as a compliment.

827
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:21,077
Mama!

828
01:38:22,086 --> 01:38:23,794
Oh, Joaquin!

829
01:38:25,839 --> 01:38:28,793
Padre's dead
and the kid's a witness.

830
01:38:58,955 --> 01:39:00,663
No, no, no.

831
01:39:02,167 --> 01:39:04,325
We'll need the next batch of it.

832
01:39:05,128 --> 01:39:06,872
Put some more here now.

833
01:39:08,006 --> 01:39:09,631
We'll rendezvous at Clanton's Pass.

834
01:39:09,841 --> 01:39:12,415
You and your men can
assume control of the train there.

835
01:39:38,703 --> 01:39:41,194
Zorro! Zorro!

836
01:39:44,250 --> 01:39:45,329
No!

837
01:40:06,731 --> 01:40:07,845
If you please.

838
01:40:44,143 --> 01:40:45,222
Remove his mask.

839
01:40:56,739 --> 01:40:57,937
You.

840
01:41:27,477 --> 01:41:29,386
You've lost it all.

841
01:41:30,689 --> 01:41:32,313
Your wife.

842
01:41:33,358 --> 01:41:34,852
Your son.

843
01:41:36,194 --> 01:41:37,854
And for what?

844
01:41:41,866 --> 01:41:43,444
For this?

845
01:41:45,120 --> 01:41:47,361
No matter where you go, Armand...

846
01:41:48,373 --> 01:41:49,997
...whatever you do...

847
01:41:50,792 --> 01:41:53,828
...the world isn't big enough
to hide from me.

848
01:42:10,395 --> 01:42:11,805
Goodbye, de la Vega.

849
01:42:13,481 --> 01:42:15,806
No! Armand, no!

850
01:42:19,987 --> 01:42:22,775
Please. Not in front of Joaquin.

851
01:42:28,955 --> 01:42:30,200
Please.

852
01:42:43,970 --> 01:42:45,962
As soon as we're gone.

853
01:42:46,180 --> 01:42:47,555
Elena.

854
01:42:51,227 --> 01:42:53,765
My family is my life.

855
01:43:42,986 --> 01:43:45,275
Shame about your friend the padre.

856
01:43:45,489 --> 01:43:47,730
But he died with God's name
on his lips...

857
01:43:47,949 --> 01:43:49,776
...and a bullet in his heart.

858
01:43:49,993 --> 01:43:53,742
And now I send you out,
a sheep amongst wolves.

859
01:45:35,180 --> 01:45:36,556
Thank God...

860
01:45:37,224 --> 01:45:38,552
...you're alive.

861
01:45:38,934 --> 01:45:40,345
I already did.

862
01:45:45,941 --> 01:45:49,144
Listen, go to the marshal's office...

863
01:45:49,361 --> 01:45:51,934
...and tell them what Armand
is doing here.

864
01:45:52,364 --> 01:45:53,395
Where are you going?

865
01:45:54,491 --> 01:45:56,069
To catch a train.

866
01:46:16,721 --> 01:46:18,928
Can I get you something to drink?

867
01:46:19,349 --> 01:46:21,176
Understand something:

868
01:46:21,685 --> 01:46:24,176
You can lock me
in a tower forever...

869
01:46:24,604 --> 01:46:26,763
...and I will never stop hating you.

870
01:46:27,649 --> 01:46:30,436
You may feel differently when you see
how Joaquin enjoys...

871
01:46:30,652 --> 01:46:32,609
...the life of an aristocrat.

872
01:46:32,821 --> 01:46:35,359
- I can't wait till my papi kicks your...
- Joaquin!

873
01:46:46,167 --> 01:46:48,789
Zorro! Zorro, Zorro!

874
01:46:52,882 --> 01:46:53,878
Don't touch him!

875
01:48:13,420 --> 01:48:14,535
Guards!

876
01:48:40,614 --> 01:48:42,072
Come on!

877
01:48:55,420 --> 01:48:56,416
Yes!

878
01:49:34,959 --> 01:49:37,165
Good boy. Well done.

879
01:50:02,653 --> 01:50:05,405
Let's see how much
your father truly loves you.

880
01:50:17,543 --> 01:50:18,788
Get the boy!

881
01:50:34,226 --> 01:50:36,135
Joaquin, quick.

882
01:50:40,941 --> 01:50:42,815
- Keep going.
- What are you doing?

883
01:50:43,026 --> 01:50:45,980
When the car stops, get off
and follow the tracks back to town.

884
01:50:46,238 --> 01:50:48,195
You are the son of Zorro.
You can do it.

885
01:50:48,407 --> 01:50:49,817
Now, go.

886
01:50:57,082 --> 01:50:58,457
How did you get in here?

887
01:52:37,473 --> 01:52:39,300
So the devil will know who sent you.

888
01:53:59,262 --> 01:54:00,887
The drinks are on me.

889
01:54:30,460 --> 01:54:32,832
My fellow Californians...

890
01:54:33,296 --> 01:54:36,961
...we have gathered here
at historic Bear Point...

891
01:54:37,174 --> 01:54:42,465
...to make official our entrance into
the United States of America!

892
01:54:43,472 --> 01:54:45,050
Bravo!

893
01:59:07,650 --> 01:59:09,726
Welcome to the Union, governor.

894
02:00:01,328 --> 02:00:04,329
Look at you.
A real heartbreaker, huh?

895
02:00:06,166 --> 02:00:07,661
- Dad?
- Yeah?

896
02:00:07,876 --> 02:00:10,546
Why didn't you tell me
who you are?

897
02:00:12,631 --> 02:00:14,090
Come here.

898
02:00:17,761 --> 02:00:19,006
Joaquin...

899
02:00:21,056 --> 02:00:25,765
...when you were born, I vowed
I would give my life to keep you safe.

900
02:00:27,229 --> 02:00:30,230
I thought I could protect you
by hiding the truth.

901
02:00:33,902 --> 02:00:35,562
But your mother was right.

902
02:00:35,779 --> 02:00:40,026
It wasn't my secret to keep.
It belongs to all of us.

903
02:00:41,743 --> 02:00:45,242
So I promise I will never
lie to you again. Never.

904
02:01:03,181 --> 02:01:08,341
I bless these rings in the name of
the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

905
02:01:15,401 --> 02:01:16,682
Elena...

906
02:01:17,445 --> 02:01:21,657
...receive this ring as a sign
of my love and fidelity.

907
02:01:25,870 --> 02:01:27,151
Alejandro...

908
02:01:28,122 --> 02:01:33,330
...receive this ring as a sign
of my love and fidelity.

909
02:01:40,802 --> 02:01:45,262
Today you join in the fullness of time
for all eternity.

910
02:01:45,473 --> 02:01:49,091
Yea, seeketh tolerance
when easily provoked.

911
02:01:49,310 --> 02:01:53,355
Love endureth,
for it keeps no score of wrongs.

912
02:01:53,773 --> 02:01:57,687
Love bears all things
and believes all things.

913
02:01:58,069 --> 02:02:00,690
Love endures day by day...

914
02:02:01,113 --> 02:02:02,607
...hour by hour...

915
02:02:02,823 --> 02:02:04,448
...minute by minute.
- Padre.

916
02:02:04,950 --> 02:02:06,658
Love is patient...

917
02:02:06,869 --> 02:02:08,114
Padre.

918
02:02:08,662 --> 02:02:11,367
Can you hurry it up a little?
The people are calling.

919
02:02:16,337 --> 02:02:18,045
It's who we are.

920
02:02:19,632 --> 02:02:21,541
- Do you want her back?
- Of course I do.

921
02:02:21,759 --> 02:02:24,428
- And you take him?
- If I must.

922
02:02:28,724 --> 02:02:31,844
You may now kiss the bride. Again.

923
02:02:38,525 --> 02:02:40,067
Don't wait up.

924
02:02:40,277 --> 02:02:41,557
Never.
