00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,339
Hey!

3
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:38,847
All the birds of a feather

4
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:42,184
Do what we love most of all

5
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,604
We are the best at rhythm and laughter

6
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,689
That's why we love Carnaval!

7
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:52,319
Call so clear we can sing to

8
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:55,697
Sun and nature's big moon

9
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:59,159
Dance to the music
Passion and love

10
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:02,538
Show us the best you can do!

11
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:05,874
Everyone here is on fire

12
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:09,211
Get up and join in the fun

13
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:12,714
Dance with a stranger
Romance and danger

14
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:17,719
Magic can happen
For real in Rio

15
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:20,639
All by itself!

16
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,891
You can't see

17
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,393
it coming

18
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,729
You can't find it anywhere else!

19
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:31,233
It's real in Rio

20
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,528
And know something else

21
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,155
You can't feel

22
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:37,948
it happening

23
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,576
You can't feel it all by yourself!

24
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:33,772
It's okay. It's okay.

25
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,197
I'll take care of you.

26
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,192
Stupid clock.

27
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:34,374
Good morning, Blu.

28
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,433
Come here!

29
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,976
Tyler Blu Gunderson!

30
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,270
You know these vitamins are good for you.

31
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,440
What's this?

32
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,776
Gotcha!

33
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:38,980
Enjoy the new book!

34
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,315
Thanks, Linda!

35
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,775
Bye, now.

36
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:46,196
Yes, Mom, I'd love to visit,
but who would take care of Blu?

37
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,825
Mom! They don't have kennels for parrots.

38
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:51,493
Here's your hot chocolate, Blu!

39
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,037
Just how you like it.

40
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:57,416
Plus, I don't trust
leaving Blu with just anyone.

41
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,501
No, I don't have a bird-sitter.

42
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,712
This is the life.

43
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,632
The perfect marshmallow-to-cocoa ratio.

44
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,968
One, two, three, four, five, six.

45
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:19,187
Well, well, if it isn't my favorite nerd bird.

46
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,231
Very funny. Real mature.

47
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:24,276
Hey, pet!
Where you migrating to this year?

48
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,861
The breakfast nook?

49
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,364
Throw all the snowballs you want.

50
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:33,285
I'm protected by this magical force-field
called glass.

51
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,454
It's what keeps us so toasty and warm
in here

52
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,706
while you guys are out there
freezing your...

53
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:41,460
Classy.

54
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,102
Are you all right?

55
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,772
I'm not really built for this weather.

56
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,066
Are you looking for some books?

57
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,736
Books? No. No.

58
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,490
I have come 6,000 miles looking for him.

59
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,036
Doctor of Ornithology?

60
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,872
He's magnificent.

61
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,794
Linda? Little help here. Linda!

62
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:28,924
Wow!

63
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,717
You're actually communicating.

64
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:34,679
Yes! I introduced myself and shook
my tail feathers counter-clockwise

65
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,431
thus deferring to his dominance.

66
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,558
I did not get that at all.

67
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,018
So, Dr. Monteiro...

68
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:43,063
No "Doctor," please, just call me Tulio.

69
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,941
You know,
your macaw is a very special bird.

70
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:50,946
In fact, as far as we know,
Blu is the last male of his kind!

71
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,113
Really?

72
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:52,948
Yes,

73
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,616
and recently, we found a female

74
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:58,453
and our hope is to bring the two of them
together to save their species.

75
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:03,166
Well, yeah, sure, when can she come over?

76
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,293
No, no. She is in Brazil.

77
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,963
Blu must come to Rio de Janeiro.

78
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,967
Rio? Brazil?

79
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,136
No. No, no, no.

80
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:18,682
I never let Blu out of my sight.
He needs me.

81
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,892
No. You misunderstand.

82
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,185
It's all arranged.

83
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,854
You will be with him
every step of the way.

84
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,481
And I will be with you.

85
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:31,069
Look, I know you're doing yourjob,
but I can't...

86
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:33,572
Well, Blu is very particular.

87
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:38,201
And we have our little routine here
and we're not big on travel.

88
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,829
Heck, he doesn't even fly!

89
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,497
But of course he can fly!

90
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,499
He's a perfect specimen.

91
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,001
What are you doing?

92
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,086
Don't worry, their natural instincts
always take over.

93
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,671
Wait, wait, wait! No, no!

94
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,091
Well, almost always.

95
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,342
Blu!

96
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,761
What kind of doctor are you?

97
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,346
Are you okay?

98
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,015
Perhaps, he's too domesticated.

99
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:04,603
It was very nice of you to stop in
and squawk around

100
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,146
and throw my bird.

101
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,647
But now it's time for you to go.

102
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,941
I'm very sorry. I'm very sorry, but...

103
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,901
Wait, wait, Linda. Linda!

104
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,070
This could be our last chance.

105
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:17,365
Have a safe flight.

106
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,244
Linda, please, listen to me.

107
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:25,915
If we don't do this,
his whole species will be gone!

108
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,797
Just think about it.

109
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,138
Natural instincts!

110
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:43,308
There is nothing natural about being
thrown halfway across the room.

111
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,768
Well, I'll show him.

112
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:46,936
I can do this.

113
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,563
I just have to work out the physics.

114
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,815
I have quadrated my vector angles.

115
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,817
I've adjusted for wind shear.

116
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,569
Positive reinforcement.

117
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:55,820
Good.

118
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,782
Okay, let's see.

119
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,700
Flaps open. Perfect.

120
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,410
Landing gear. Check.

121
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,746
Tail flaps. Operational.

122
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,916
And, actually, not bad.

123
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:09,918
This is it.

124
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,461
Let's fly.

125
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,632
Just keep it simple.

126
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,635
Thrust, lift, drag and weight.

127
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:22,180
Thrust, lift, drag, weight.

128
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:24,015
Thrust, lift, drag... Wait!

129
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,105
Blu?

130
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:43,660
I promised I would always look out for you,
didn't I?

131
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:50,041
And have I ever broken a promise?

132
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,796
I'm scared, too

133
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:59,634
but I wouldn't make you do this
if it wasn't the right thing to do.

134
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,762
What do you say, Blu?

135
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,063
That's my big, brave boy.

136
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:15,650
And we'll be back home
before we even know it.

137
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:47,766
Your turn, Blu!

138
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,018
You don't want to get beak-burn.

139
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,700
Whoa! What is going on here?

140
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,703
- You arrived in time for Carnaval!
- Carnaval?

141
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:11,289
Yes, it's the biggest party in the world.

142
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:14,417
You know,
a time to have fun and dance!

143
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,045
Oh, my!

144
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,215
Is she a performer?

145
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:23,134
No, in fact, she's my dentist.

146
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,511
Dr. Barbosa!

147
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:28,223
Don't forget to floss, Tulio!

148
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,225
You got it!

149
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:33,394
Come tomorrow night,
everyone will be dressed like that.

150
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:35,522
Not me.

151
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,074
Oh, right yeah.

152
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:51,246
I am not from here.

153
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,081
Hey, Nico, he's a tourist!

154
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,582
Funny, you don't look like one.

155
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,334
Really? I don't?

156
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,962
Except you got pigeon doo-doo
on your nose.

157
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,548
Oh, no, this is just SPF 3000.

158
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,258
So, are you here for Carnaval?

159
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:06,261
Actually, I'm just here to meet a girl.

160
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,096
- A girl!
- Yes!

161
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,765
Little word of advice,
you make the first move.

162
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,851
Brazilian ladies respond to confidence.

163
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:13,935
Right.

164
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:17,605
Yeah, it's all about swagger.
You got to puff out that chest!

165
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,107
Swing that tail!

166
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,944
Eyes narrow,
like some kind of crazy love-hawk!

167
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,530
- But first we got to bust you out.
- What?

168
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:28,992
Yeah! I'm gonna pop that cage open
like a soda can!

169
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,618
No, no. Wait!

170
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,287
No, no, no, that's okay.

171
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,956
You call that popping?

172
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,791
This thing is robust.

173
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,877
No, no, guys, really, I'm fine.
The cage is great.

174
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,253
Love the cage!

175
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:41,671
Suit yourself!

176
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,631
Don't forget, love-hawk!

177
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,302
Yes, yes, Bem...

178
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:49,387
And to you, as well.

179
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,820
This is the heart and soul of our aviary.

180
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,155
Our treatment room.

181
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,992
They really like you.

182
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,494
A lot.

183
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:16,039
Yes. I'm their great, big mama bird.

184
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,338
Wow!

185
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:24,672
Want some?

186
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,341
I'm good.

187
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,345
Many of the birds here
were rescued from smugglers.

188
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:31,763
Smugglers?

189
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:35,683
Yes! And unfortunately,
the poor birds are often hurt

190
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,477
or even killed in the process.

191
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:40,688
But with proper care, they can be saved.

192
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,316
Look here.
This poor guy was found last night.

193
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,737
Hey, buddy! You're looking great today.

194
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:50,490
Much better, much better!

195
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,159
Get well soon!

196
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:57,747
So, where is Jewel?

197
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,999
We have a special place for Jewel.

198
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,876
She's a very spirited bird.

199
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,878
I'll say.

200
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,546
She did that?

201
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:08,091
Charming. Okay, I want to go home now.

202
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,009
No, no. Don't worry.

203
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:12,804
I'm going to make you look irresistible.

204
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,104
Help! Help! Let me out of here!

205
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,068
Linda!

206
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:30,697
- Maybe I should...
- No, no. Give it a chance.

207
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:46,004
Hello?

208
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,591
I come in peace.

209
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,765
Whoa. She's beautiful.

210
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:04,939
What were they talking about?
She's like an angel.

211
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:10,486
An angel who's getting really close...

212
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,785
You're standing on my throat.

213
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,537
You're an American.

214
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:23,624
Thanks. I need my throat for talking.
So, thank you.

215
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,293
You look like me.

216
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:27,336
Hi.

217
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,130
Hi, my name is Blu.

218
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:32,967
Like the cheese with the mold on it.
You know, that smells really bad.

219
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,303
That's stupid. Stupid, stupid, stupid.

220
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,805
Come on. We don't have much time.

221
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,683
Wait, wait, wait.

222
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,072
- Are you ready?
- For what?

223
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,157
Wow. Okay.

224
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:59,786
Confidence. Crazy love-hawk.

225
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,163
All right.

226
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,873
Whoa, what are you doing?

227
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,666
What? What you wanted me to.

228
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,753
But just for argument's sake,
what are you doing?

229
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:11,339
I am trying to escape.

230
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:15,510
Yeah, escape, that's where I was going
with that thing I just did.

231
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:19,013
Wait, wait. Did you actually think
we were going to kiss?

232
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,515
- No! It's not what you think.
- We just met.

233
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:21,682
Oh, my.

234
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,851
I think they need a little help.

235
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:27,355
I know how my feathers look,
but I am not that kind of bird.

236
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,943
Okay, I had nothing to do with that.

237
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:35,113
But, you have to admit
it's actually a pretty good song.

238
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,366
Naturally

239
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,867
Yeah, sing it, Lionel.

240
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,750
Wow. That was fast.

241
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:51,212
Lionel Richie works every time.

242
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,923
We should probably give them
some privacy.

243
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:03,266
I'm not so sure
I should leave Blu here alone.

244
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,851
No, don't worry.

245
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,228
Sylvio will keep an eye on them all night.

246
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,985
Besides, he's got Jewel.

247
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:21,909
Help me!

248
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,292
This is the final countdown to Carnaval!

249
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,877
Let's samba!

250
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:03,117
Come here, poor little birdie.

251
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,913
It's okay, I got you.

252
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,456
I got you.

253
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:32,980
Excuse me.

254
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:36,067
Please, I am trying to sleep.

255
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:40,655
I'm sorry, sleepy-head,
I'm trying to escape.

256
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:44,492
Escape? Why?
This cage is awesome.

257
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,826
This...

258
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,995
What was I thinking?

259
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:51,374
I wouldn't expect a pet to understand.

260
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,834
Pet? Did you just call me a pet?

261
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,962
For the record, I am not a pet.

262
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,463
I am a companion.

263
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:58,965
And you know what?
Do whatever you want

264
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,050
'cause tomorrow morning,
Linda will come for me

265
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,885
and this whole nightmare
will be over.

266
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,220
Incredible!

267
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,723
You would rather be with a human
than with your own kind.

268
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:11,811
Well, that human has given me love
and affection for the past 15 years

269
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:15,147
whereas my own kind try to strangle me
after 15 seconds.

270
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:18,025
Yeah, well, because of them,
I've lost everything.

271
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,694
You can't trust them.

272
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:20,861
Of course...

273
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:22,363
you can trust humans.

274
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:25,992
Jewel? Jewel?

275
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,035
Hi, there.

276
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,548
It was nice of you to join me for dinner.

277
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,800
I often eat alone.

278
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:45,094
Because, of course, my work.

279
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:48,472
I thought I was the bird nut until I met you.

280
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:49,724
Yes, right.

281
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,517
Do you have a favorite bird?

282
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:55,563
Well, obviously,
I'm a blue macaw kind of gal.

283
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,274
That makes sense.
They are very handsome birds.

284
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,901
Actually, it's the brains
I'm more attracted to.

285
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:03,738
I'm not so impressed
by fancy feathers.

286
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,531
I know exactly what you mean.

287
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,616
My favorite bird is the spotted owl.

288
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,493
I've always been mesmerized

289
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,078
by those big...

290
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:14,248
round, intelligent eyes.

291
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,586
Chicken hearts?

292
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,799
Chicken hearts! Oh, gosh.

293
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,312
Hello?

294
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,665
Oh, Blu.

295
00:22:56,833 --> 00:23:00,169
We should have never left Moose Lake.

296
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,296
This is all my fault.

297
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:06,717
No, no, Linda, Linda, please.
This is not your fault.

298
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:09,804
You're right.

299
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,972
It's not my fault.

300
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:13,724
- It's your fault!
- What?

301
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,476
With your little bird talk.

302
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:18,229
And that whole "save the species. "

303
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,397
Well, you know what?

304
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,899
Squawk, squawkity, squawk, squawk!

305
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:24,902
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to curse.

306
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,237
I don't understand.

307
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,406
Sylvio is the best guard in the business.

308
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:29,740
So, let me get this straight.

309
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,034
You were attacked by a little white bird?

310
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:34,328
Yes, with this rag.

311
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,747
He held it to my mouth like this.

312
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,631
We're doomed.

313
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:56,892
Okay. There's no place like home,
there's no place like home.

314
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:58,602
How I wish I was back in my own cage

315
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,772
with my mirror and my swing,
and my little bell.

316
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,441
How I miss my little bell.

317
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:04,942
Play dead.

318
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:08,779
What? I don't need to play dead,
I'm about to have a heart attack.

319
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,281
Just do it!

320
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:11,907
Fine.

321
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:18,581
Stop twitching.

322
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,958
Come on, it's the twitching that sells it.

323
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,089
Come on in, kid.

324
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,307
Well, what do you know?

325
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,975
Good work, Fernando.

326
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:40,478
You see, boys?

327
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:42,771
What did I tell you about this one?

328
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,858
That you were going to pay him
half as much as you said?

329
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,359
No, you idiot.

330
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:50,488
That he reminds me of myself
when I was that age.

331
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,823
Smart, resourceful.

332
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:53,991
Here you go, kid.

333
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,912
Hey. This is only half
of what you promised me.

334
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,580
Shut up, kid.

335
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:00,915
What the...

336
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,253
I thought I told you
I needed these birds alive.

337
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:07,630
Tell me, Fernando...

338
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,757
does this look alive to you?

339
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:13,427
Get her!

340
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:14,678
Come over here!

341
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:16,222
Jewel!

342
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:18,974
Come here!

343
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,107
Hello...

344
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,026
pretty bird.

345
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:30,736
What's the matter?

346
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,071
Cockatoo got your throat?

347
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:33,155
Nigel!

348
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,658
Alive.

349
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,785
To be continued.

350
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:46,752
That was your plan?
To take off and leave me? Gee, thanks.

351
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:48,796
Well, why didn't you follow me?

352
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,550
Nice work, Nigel.

353
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,552
Yeah, nice work, Nigel.

354
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,680
The last blue macaws on earth.

355
00:25:58,014 --> 00:25:59,682
These are worth a fortune.

356
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:03,185
Hey, Fernando,
hang these up in the other room.

357
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:17,908
Hey, birdie!

358
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,786
Let me out! Let me out! Let me out of here!

359
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:21,996
Who's a pretty bird? I'm a pretty bird.

360
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,665
Pretty bird, I'm a pretty bird.
I'm a pretty bird.

361
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:27,167
I was framed. They got the wrong guy.

362
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:29,336
Sorry, guys. Nothing personal.

363
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:42,266
So, what's going to happen to them?

364
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:45,853
Don't worry, we're going to find
good homes for them.

365
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:47,855
Now go home to your mama.

366
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,189
But I don't have a mama.

367
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,316
Father?

368
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,109
- Brother?
- Goldfish?

369
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:55,195
Can we keep him, boss?

370
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,072
No.

371
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,368
So, Marcel, what's really going to happen
to those birds?

372
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,871
Plucked, stuffed, eaten, who cares?

373
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,707
All I know is we're going to be rich.

374
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,335
We're gonna be rich!

375
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,426
Come on, come on! The game is starting!

376
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:03,013
Yes, you were very clear.
Tomorrow or the deal is off.

377
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,265
Of course I have both the macaws.

378
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:08,018
Yes, I will deliver them myself.

379
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,022
All right, you two...

380
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,273
you load the truck tonight.

381
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:16,193
And first thing in the morning,
we bring those birds to the airport.

382
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:17,486
You got it?

383
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,488
- Yeah, sure.
- All right. Heard you.

384
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,990
And one of you, feed Nigel.

385
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,666
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

386
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:31,667
Yes!

387
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:34,128
Nuh-uh, scissors cuts rock.

388
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:36,630
Oh, man. How come you always win?

389
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,052
Nice birdie.

390
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:46,974
Here you go.

391
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:56,817
Cannibal.

392
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:01,655
Okay, pull it together.
The key is not to panic.

393
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,823
I'm not panicking.

394
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:04,825
I wasn't talking to you,
I was talking to me.

395
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:07,911
But it's okay, because any minute now,
Linda will find us.

396
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:11,206
Great. And then she'll stick us behind
another set of bars, right?

397
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:12,624
Yeah. I mean, no.

398
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:17,254
Look, pet, cages might work for you,
but I don't want to belong to anyone.

399
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:28,348
Something seems to be lodged in my beak.

400
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,392
Would you mind?

401
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,075
I know I'm not a pretty birdie...

402
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,536
but I used to be quite a looker.

403
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,538
A star.

404
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,251
Lights, camera, action.

405
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:59,630
I was striking,
suave, ambitious.

406
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:00,756
Feet to beak...

407
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,257
so birdie-licious

408
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:05,052
Now I'm vile, I am villainous,
and vicious

409
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,929
Oh, and malicious

410
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:09,556
I had it all
A TV show, women, too

411
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,351
I was tall
Over one-foot-two

412
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:15,062
Then they got a
pretty parakeet to fill my shoes

413
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,439
That's why I am so evil,
why I do what I do.

414
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:18,607
He was a super star

415
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:19,983
So young and vital

416
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,151
He's nasty

417
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,653
A South American Idol

418
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:23,946
He's a suspicious bird

419
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,197
Who said that about me?

420
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:27,783
- A very vicious bird
- I'll have you rotisseried

421
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,576
I'm a feathery freak
With a beak

422
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:30,828
A bird murderer

423
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,455
You think you're badder than me?
I never heard of ya

424
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:36,083
I'm eviI,
I'll fill your cheese balls with weevils

425
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:38,627
I poop on people
and I blame it on seagulls

426
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:40,796
It was him.

427
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,423
- He's a nasty bird
- I'm invincible

428
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:45,926
- He's ghastly
- I'm un-mince-able

429
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:48,428
I'm unwashable, unrinseable

430
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:51,056
Like an abandoned school
I have no principle

431
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,475
All of you Brazilian birds

432
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,894
All 80 million birds

433
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,355
I'll tell you what I'm going to do

434
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,691
I'm going to make you

435
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,943
Shut up, now. Shut up!

436
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,279
It's just me.

437
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:09,366
I will make you ugly...

438
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,326
...too.

439
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:12,411
Hey!

440
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:13,579
Sweet nightmares.

441
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:17,666
Not cool, man!

442
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:19,626
Scary, but not cool!

443
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:21,503
Hey, are you okay?

444
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:24,298
No, I am definitely not okay!

445
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,632
Wait. What are you doing?

446
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,342
Getting out of here.

447
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:28,886
Are you going to help me or what?

448
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:32,723
Actually, all the survival guides say
to sit and wait, and help will come.

449
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:34,224
No one is coming!

450
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:37,811
We are on our own and if we just sit here,
we're going to die!

451
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,481
Yes! Yes!

452
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:42,608
Yes!

453
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,234
No!

454
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,737
Nigel! Get out of the way!

455
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:48,488
Hold on!

456
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:52,159
Stop! Stop!
Why don't you just open the door?

457
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:53,785
Are you kidding me?

458
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,621
What? It's just a standard flip slide bolt.

459
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:56,747
Come on! Let's fly!

460
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,624
What are you doing?

461
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,667
- I can't.
- What? You can't what?

462
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:08,008
I can't fly!

463
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:11,178
You couldn't tell me this before now?

464
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,055
It didn't matter before now!

465
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,018
I hate you.

466
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,481
Is there anything else I need to know?

467
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:25,484
Yes, I can't fly, I pick my beak,
and once in a while I pee in the bird-bath.

468
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:26,568
Happy?

469
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:27,694
There they are!

470
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:28,820
We got to get out of here!

471
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,280
Just move! Move!

472
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,076
Wait, wait. Listen to me.

473
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:36,286
Flying may not be my thing,
but walking is.

474
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,205
Follow my lead. Inside leg, outside leg.

475
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,289
Yeah, okay, I got it.

476
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,917
Inside, outside, inside, outside!

477
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:45,420
Yes! Yes! Yes!

478
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:47,714
- Yes. Yes!
- Come on!

479
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,308
See? I'm bilingual, too!

480
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:04,106
This is great!

481
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,316
I'm chained to the only bird in the world
who can't fly!

482
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,819
Actually, there are about 40 species
of flightless birds.

483
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:10,278
- Duck!
- No, ducks can fly.

484
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:11,738
No! Duck!

485
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:45,439
Yes!

486
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,773
Hold on!

487
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:53,321
No!

488
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,459
Get out of here, you putrid poultry!

489
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:24,478
What was that?

490
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:25,604
A stick.

491
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:26,688
And that?

492
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:27,939
It's just a rock.

493
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,483
Right. Yeah.

494
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:33,070
Is that a spider on my back?

495
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,696
Will you quit it?

496
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:37,032
It's just a leaf. Turn around.

497
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:43,497
Leaf. Told you.

498
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:47,250
Now, come on, we need to find
a safe place to spend the night.

499
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,502
Safe? Safe?

500
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:49,920
We are in the jungle.

501
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,963
You know when people say,
"It's a jungle out there"?

502
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,882
Well, I'm pretty sure
they don't mean it as a good thing.

503
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:57,969
Look, I hate to break it to you,
but this is where our kind naturally lives.

504
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:01,473
Hey, don't talk to me about nature.
I watch Animal Planet.

505
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:03,725
I know all about the food chain.

506
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:09,397
You see?
Out here, I'm just an hors d'oeuvre.

507
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,525
Nothing more than a feathery spring roll.

508
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:14,861
That is why we stay in the trees
and not on the ground.

509
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,238
After you.

510
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:19,032
No, I don't think so.

511
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:23,537
No. I would feel much more comfortable
in something man-made.

512
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,957
Hey, how about up there?

513
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:33,130
I can't believe
I have to drag your clumsy butt up there.

514
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:34,673
Drag me?

515
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:36,258
Watch and learn.

516
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,138
Blu! Just wait one...

517
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,430
Blu?

518
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,392
Who's dragging whose butt now?

519
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,352
Very funny.

520
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,611
You see? Who needs flying?

521
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:59,239
Birds. Birds need flying.

522
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,657
Flying is...

523
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:05,078
It's freedom
and not having to rely on anyone.

524
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,373
Don't you want that?

525
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:11,585
I don't know.
It sounds a little lonely.

526
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:13,920
Let's get some sleep.

527
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:18,049
I'm probably going to be up
for a little while.

528
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:20,468
Because I'm still on Minnesota time.

529
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:22,137
Good night.

530
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,472
Good night, Jewel.

531
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,895
Good night, Linda.

532
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,486
Excuse me, sir?

533
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:43,116
Have you seen my bird?

534
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:49,206
Excuse me?
Have you seen my bird?

535
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:28,161
Have you seen my bird? Blue feather.

536
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,996
Lady! American lady!

537
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,666
- Blu?
- Where?

538
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:38,421
Wow. I know where your birds are.

539
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,715
You found Blu? Are you sure?

540
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:42,592
It's his!

541
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:43,885
Let me see that.

542
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,017
You're right.

543
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:52,769
Okay. Where is he?

544
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:55,230
Come on, let's go! I'll take you to him.

545
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,190
No, no. Linda, wait.

546
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:00,694
We don't know this boy.
We can't trust him.

547
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:06,032
I have to trust him.

548
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,618
I don't have a choice.

549
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,717
Do you think I'm an idiot?

550
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:29,222
They were two birds
chained together in a cage.

551
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,640
How could you lose them?

552
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:34,519
They outsmarted us, boss.
But don't worry, we'll get them back.

553
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,354
I have a plan.

554
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:38,315
Great. What are you going to do?

555
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:42,152
Wander the city calling
"Here birdie, birdie. Here birdie"?

556
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,697
Well, anything sounds dumb
when you say it like that.

557
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,367
Okay. We have to get the birds
to the airport tonight.

558
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:52,412
But it's Carnaval.
All the roads will be blocked by the parade.

559
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:55,790
And that's why
I wanted to go this morning.

560
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,167
Nigel.

561
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:01,004
This bird is 10 times smarter
than the two of you combined.

562
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:04,716
Yeah, well, if he's so smart,
then why don't you put him in charge?

563
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,760
I am putting him in charge.

564
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,555
Stop suggesting things.

565
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,724
Go find them, Nigel.

566
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:26,613
If we can't get through the parade,
we'll have to be in the parade.

567
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:33,161
Are you sure
this is going to work?

568
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,622
Positive. Check out my math.

569
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:39,542
Yeah, that's comforting. Thank you.

570
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:42,045
Look, let's just get this chain broken.

571
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:44,297
Right. Then we can go and find Linda.

572
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,674
No, you can go find Linda.

573
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:50,553
Once this chain is off, I'm going to go
back to being free in the jungle. Deal?

574
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:51,679
Fine. Deal.

575
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:01,356
Nice try, brainiac.

576
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,361
I think something is watching us.

577
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:15,203
Be careful, Blu.
They might snuggle you to death.

578
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:19,040
Come here.

579
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,004
Intruders!

580
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,048
Cut it out!

581
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,760
Now stop...

582
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:35,223
No! Don't!

583
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:38,601
Attack!

584
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,063
Help!

585
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,690
What's going on down there?

586
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,068
Go, go. Off with you.

587
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:48,194
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

588
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:49,904
I've told you a thousand times.

589
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,698
Manoela, Sofia, come on now, listen to me.

590
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:52,949
Oh, yeah, right in the eye.

591
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:55,160
Precious, aren't they?

592
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:57,996
Kids? Seventeen of them
and one on the way.

593
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:01,124
Hey! He's not a maraca, stop shaking him!

594
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,920
They're giving me gray feathers.

595
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:08,339
This papa needs a break.

596
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:10,842
So, you two lovebirds headed for Carnaval?

597
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,636
- Lovebirds?
- We're more like acquaintance-birds.

598
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,306
Not even that, we're more like
chained-to-each-other birds.

599
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,974
Yeah. I mean, if...

600
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:20,894
What is it with this kid and the feathers?

601
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:23,646
We have no idea. We're having him tested.

602
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:27,901
So, do you think you could help us
get this thing off?

603
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:34,157
Lucky for you, you know Rafael,
and Rafael knows everyone.

604
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,910
Again with the eye.
Okay, want me to call your mother?

605
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,328
No!

606
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:40,497
Works every time.
They're scared to death of her.

607
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,540
Call me for what?

608
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:43,833
Eva, my love...

609
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,503
I must take this young couple to see Luiz.

610
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:47,795
Luiz!

611
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,089
You don't fool me for a second.

612
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:53,259
You and your amigo
just want to sneak off to Carnaval.

613
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:55,762
Carnaval.

614
00:41:55,930 --> 00:42:00,433
That magical time when I met
the most beautiful bird in the world.

615
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:07,106
I still remember the song that was playing
when I first laid eyes on you.

616
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:10,860
Tall and tan and
young and lovely

617
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:14,781
The girl from Ipanema
goes walking

618
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:15,949
Come on, baby, sing it!

619
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:19,994
And when she passes,
each one she passes goes, ah!

620
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:25,250
Like a river of the sweetest honey.

621
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:27,961
I guess love is deaf, too.

622
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:29,546
Come here.

623
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:37,136
Okay. Take them to Luiz, but hurry back.

624
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,763
You are an angel.

625
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,890
I'll miss you my juicy little mango.

626
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:44,227
I'll miss you my pudgy papaya.

627
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:47,772
Hey! Marco! Carlos!
Put your brother down, now!

628
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,816
I can't believe she actually let me go.

629
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,985
So, how far is this Luiz?

630
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:55,488
Not far. Thirty minutes as the crow flies.

631
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,740
And how long as the macaw walks?

632
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:00,410
- Bobo here can't fly.
- But he's a bird.

633
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:01,327
Not all birds fly.

634
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:02,161
There are ostriches...

635
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:03,496
You're not an ostrich.

636
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:05,164
- Not technically, but...
- Wait.

637
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,667
My friends, I want to help,
but to walk the whole way...

638
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:08,793
It can't be done!

639
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:09,919
Where's Daddy?

640
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,921
- Daddy? Daddy?
- Come over here. Go back to your room.

641
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,006
But, hey.

642
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:15,091
We might as well give it a shot.
Let's go quickly.

643
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:17,468
No, don't look back. They sense fear.

644
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:45,121
What an adorable monkey.

645
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:03,681
Hey! My watch!

646
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:31,250
Hello, boys.

647
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,836
Seems like you've had a busy day.

648
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,088
What? This?

649
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:39,092
This is just some stuff we found.
Right, boys?

650
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,468
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

651
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:42,970
I'm not interested
in your nicked knick-knacks.

652
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:45,932
Your burgled baubles bore me.

653
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,518
There are two blue macaws out there

654
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:52,438
and I need your multitude of eyes
to help me find them.

655
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:55,274
Yeah? What's in it for us?

656
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:57,402
Well, that's a fair question.

657
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:04,200
Let's discuss it.

658
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:11,791
I certainly see your point, but what
could I possibly do for you in return?

659
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,793
Save me! Save me!

660
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:16,129
Well, that's a thought. Yeah.

661
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:18,798
But is it enough? I don't want
to feel like I'm cheating you.

662
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:20,383
Help me! Help me! No, no!

663
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:22,635
We'll do it, we'll do it. Save me, please.

664
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:25,263
Save me!

665
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:28,975
All right, you've twisted my wing.

666
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:30,518
Deal.

667
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:33,146
Now then? Any more questions?

668
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:35,273
No? Good.

669
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:39,402
You will spread out and you will find
these macaws by the end of the day

670
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:41,654
or it's flying lessons for everyone!

671
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:43,030
Go!

672
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:48,035
Go do your monkey business.

673
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:05,511
I've changed my mind, yeah.

674
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:08,181
Maybe we can find a bus schedule
or something.

675
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,183
Come on, you're not going to back out now.

676
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:12,518
Not in front of the lady.

677
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:16,189
Okay, yeah. Yeah, sure.

678
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:17,857
All right, that's the spirit.

679
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:19,484
You're sure you're up for this?

680
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:20,943
Yeah, yeah. I mean,

681
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:24,614
it's not like we're just hurling
ourselves off a mountain or something.

682
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:25,698
Right?

683
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,784
Actually that was
pretty much my entire plan.

684
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:28,868
What?

685
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:31,537
Don't worry, Blu, it's in your DNA.

686
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,998
And if our featherless friends can do it,
how hard can it be?

687
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:35,333
Wait, wait!

688
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:39,295
Mommy!

689
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:40,588
Fun, right?

690
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:42,298
Yeah. Fun.

691
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:45,468
Okay. I need you two to get closer.

692
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:51,224
Closer.

693
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,185
Nice.

694
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:55,895
Now put your wings around each other.

695
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:57,897
- What?
- Come on, amigo!

696
00:46:58,023 --> 00:46:59,816
It's not like she's going to bite!

697
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:00,900
Will you?

698
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:02,235
We'll see.

699
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:03,110
Now,

700
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:04,320
you flap your right wing,

701
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:08,366
you flap your left wing,
and together you fly.

702
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:11,661
But this doesn't seem
aerodynamically possible.

703
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,247
You think too much.

704
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:18,751
Flying is not what you think up here,
it's what you feel in here.

705
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:22,338
And when you feel the rhythm
of your heart, it's like samba.

706
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:23,923
You fly!

707
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:30,513
See? It's easy!

708
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:31,681
Easy?

709
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:33,516
Easy for you to say, because from here

710
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,935
it looks really, really hard.

711
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:40,064
Hey, if you want to see Linda again,
this is the only way.

712
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:41,858
Okay. You're right.

713
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:43,276
- Yes, I am.
- This is for Linda.

714
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:44,527
- Right.
- Keep it simple.

715
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:46,946
- Easy breezy.
- Thrust, lift, drag...

716
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:48,197
- Come on! Let's go!
- Wait!

717
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:50,533
- Inside, outside, inside, outside.
- Inside, outside, inside, outside.

718
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:51,701
Come on, Blu! You can do it!

719
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:52,869
I can do it. I can do it.

720
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:53,536
I can do it.

721
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,162
I can't do it!

722
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:56,956
Not again!

723
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:09,385
- Am I dead?
- No!

724
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:11,178
We're still alive!

725
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:25,443
Wow! This is incredible.

726
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,247
Wow.

727
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:41,208
This is the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

728
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:43,252
See what you've been missing?

729
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:45,004
Yeah.

730
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:53,012
All right, Blu, you're flying!

731
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:56,015
Sort of. Not really, but do you feel it?

732
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:57,266
Yes!

733
00:48:58,185 --> 00:48:59,810
I do feel it.

734
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:14,742
No, no, Blu! Wait!

735
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:28,005
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

736
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:30,758
We're gonna die!

737
00:49:57,911 --> 00:50:00,496
You did not feel it in here.

738
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:01,914
You think?

739
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,085
Let's catch a ride to Luiz.

740
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:09,588
Hurry, you two!

741
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:12,258
Okay.

742
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:14,385
Last of the species here.

743
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:16,012
Move it!

744
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:17,596
Hey. Wait up.

745
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:18,806
Come on, lovebirds!

746
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:22,935
You made it.

747
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,730
I would love to go five minutes
without almost getting killed.

748
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:26,939
Is that too much to ask?

749
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:29,859
For a bird who can't fly, yeah.

750
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:37,450
They're starting to close off the streets
for Carnaval.

751
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:41,370
You better be right, kid.
Because we're running out of time.

752
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:55,384
I'll never be able to get my car
through this crowd.

753
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,094
Don't worry, I'm on it.

754
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,099
Watch it!

755
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:04,560
Hey, kid, how did you get this bike?

756
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:06,854
- I traded it for your Jeep.
- What?

757
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:09,273
Yeah, it's in great condition.

758
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,401
Well, good condition!

759
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:14,487
Hey! Out of the way!

760
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:16,113
Look out!

761
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:19,658
Hold on!

762
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:36,759
I'm going to chew through my own leg
if this doesn't come off soon.

763
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:39,595
Relax. If I know Luiz,
we're right where we want to be.

764
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:40,971
Hey! Rafi!

765
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:43,682
If it isn't the king of Carnaval!

766
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:45,976
Nico! Pedro! What up, family?

767
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:47,812
Where you been hiding yourself, bird?

768
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:49,188
Man, I thought you were dead.

769
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:51,148
Hold up! Rewind.

770
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,526
Ain't that the bird from the cage?

771
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:56,028
I think our love lessons went down smooth.

772
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:57,321
You work fast.

773
00:51:57,405 --> 00:51:58,531
Baby got beak.

774
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:01,367
You was locked up
and now you're rolling with a hot-wing.

775
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:02,785
I want to be like you.

776
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:05,329
No, it's not what you think.
We're just chained together.

777
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:06,789
Hey, I'm not judging you.

778
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:08,541
- Keep it spicy.
- Oh, yeah.

779
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:10,709
Hey, guys, we're looking for Luiz.
Have you seen him?

780
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:13,462
Yeah, I seen him, but you didn't,
because you just missed him.

781
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:15,631
He took the trolley back to the garage.

782
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:16,715
Great.

783
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:19,051
Relax, baby bird.
You could catch the next one.

784
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:21,220
Yeah, it's time to take it to the next level.

785
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:22,888
What's wrong with this level?

786
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:25,516
Come on! This ain't the level.
The next level's the level.

787
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:27,143
You got to shake your tail feathers.

788
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:28,978
We got to get this chain off first.

789
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:32,398
Come on, lovebirds! You're in Rio!
You should enjoy it!

790
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:34,692
Yeah! Live a little.

791
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:57,423
We got them.

792
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,426
Hey!

793
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:08,184
Welcome to paradise!

794
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:10,269
Some party, huh?

795
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:12,188
This is the coolest place I've ever seen.

796
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:15,024
Despite all the obvious
health code violations.

797
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:18,777
I like you!
Nothing you say makes any sense.

798
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:21,405
All right, everyone, listen up!

799
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:24,116
Rafi has some special guests
from out of town

800
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:28,037
and let's show them some love,
because I don't think they get out much.

801
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:32,625
Everybody put their wings together
and clap them as loud as you can.

802
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:35,628
Flap them. Clap them.
I don't care, slap them.

803
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:39,048
Party in the Ipanema, baby.

804
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:48,974
I wanna party
I wanna samba

805
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:51,185
I wanna party

806
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:53,145
- And live my life
- My life

807
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,231
- I wanna party
- Party

808
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:57,441
And fly

809
00:53:57,609 --> 00:54:00,527
High! I'm gonna fly
Fly just like a bird

810
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:01,654
But you are a bird

811
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:04,698
Oh, yeah, you're right
So let me fly just like a rocket then

812
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:06,283
- Okay
- Fly so high

813
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:08,452
Where I need to come down for oxygen

814
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:12,164
'Cause once we start it
Baby, ain't no, ain't no stopping then

815
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:16,085
'Cause I just want to live my life
and party

816
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:19,255
All I want is to be free
And rock my body

817
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:20,339
Okay

818
00:54:20,548 --> 00:54:21,840
I've been around the world

819
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:24,093
And I want to live my life in Rio

820
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:26,553
'Cause I Rio, 'cause I Rio realize

821
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:27,972
What are you doing?

822
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:29,598
I don't know.

823
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:31,976
All right, Blu!

824
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:33,519
And fly!

825
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:38,107
I'm that samba, samba master
Master, master, master, master

826
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:42,027
Push out sound from a ghetto blaster
Blaster, blaster, blaster, blaster

827
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:44,071
Hey. She likes you.

828
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:46,031
What are you talking about?
Haven't you been listening?

829
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:47,700
No, but I've been watching.

830
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:49,952
Just be yourself. Go on.

831
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,288
- I wanna samba
- Party

832
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:53,998
- I wanna party
- Party

833
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:55,833
- I wanna samba
- Party

834
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:57,876
- I wanna party
- Party

835
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,920
- And live my life
- My life

836
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:01,839
- I want to party
- Party

837
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:04,008
And fly

838
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:49,428
You two are coming with me.

839
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:51,680
In your little monkey dreams.

840
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,475
Yeah.

841
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:57,061
That was meant for you.

842
00:55:57,854 --> 00:56:00,606
Come on. Can we all just get along?

843
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:03,776
This isn't your fight, big-nose.

844
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:06,862
You mess with my friends,
you mess with me!

845
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:08,238
And us!

846
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:10,866
Yeah, little King Kong.

847
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,709
I don't know what's going on here.

848
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:22,753
Birds versus monkeys!

849
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:23,879
Get them!

850
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:31,678
Yippee-kai-yay, monkey man!

851
00:56:41,606 --> 00:56:43,107
Yee-haw! Giddy-up!

852
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,196
Missed!

853
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:54,743
We got to go!

854
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,080
Need a lift?

855
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:13,303
Take that, you funky monkey!

856
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:20,769
- Thank you!
- Anytime!

857
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:22,062
That's what I'm talking about!

858
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:23,647
Man, we threw down!

859
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:24,731
Yeah, we threw down.

860
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:26,775
You guys were like fire and ice.

861
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,485
- Thunder and lightning!
- Hip and hop!

862
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:30,696
Cheese and sprinkles!

863
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:33,198
It's a Minnesota thing.

864
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:36,785
You see?
Nothing you say makes any sense.

865
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,416
Come on, follow me.

866
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,299
What?

867
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:54,261
But the birds were here.

868
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:55,679
Yeah, sure they were, kid.

869
00:57:55,763 --> 00:57:57,848
I swear, the birds were right here.

870
00:57:58,016 --> 00:58:00,350
- Well, how do you know?
- Because

871
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:03,145
I'm... I'm the one who took them.

872
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,354
You!

873
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:08,025
I didn't want to hurt anybody,
I needed the money.

874
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:10,277
But Fernando, I trusted you!

875
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:11,612
I know, but...

876
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,282
Man, that's good.

877
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:17,409
Hey, guys.

878
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:18,911
What are you doing here?

879
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:22,372
I just wanted to see
if you had any work for me.

880
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:26,001
Well, if you were here two hours ago,
you could've helped us load the...

881
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:28,337
- What?
- Shut up.

882
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:31,798
So, why are you guys dressed for Carnaval?

883
00:58:31,966 --> 00:58:34,843
So no one will notice us
when we smuggle these...

884
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:36,595
Shut up!

885
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:40,057
We made a float.

886
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,184
A float!

887
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,603
So you guys are going to the parade.
Can I come?

888
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:46,438
I'm a great dancer.

889
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:49,816
Can he come? Come on, please.
Three is better than two.

890
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:52,903
Fine. We got to hurry though.

891
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,113
I almost forgot.

892
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:58,408
Where did I put it?
I thought it was right here.

893
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:01,453
There it is.

894
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:02,955
Got it.

895
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:04,748
Let's go.

896
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:06,542
Hurry up, kid.

897
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,418
Can he ride on the plane with us, too?

898
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:09,836
Shut up!

899
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:12,798
No. We can't let them get on that plane.

900
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:18,303
You can drive a motorcycle, right?

901
00:59:19,013 --> 00:59:20,597
You insult me.

902
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:32,401
No, I can't drive a motorcycle.

903
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:47,040
It's just like riding a snowmobile.

904
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:06,977
What happened?

905
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:08,103
Papa?

906
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:10,022
What happened?

907
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:15,652
Oh, no! Let me go.

908
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:17,446
Stop your chirping and talk to me!

909
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:19,740
No, no. I don't know anything. Help!

910
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:24,661
When I bite down on your head,
will it go "pop," or will it go "crack"?

911
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:28,373
Where are the cerulean birds?

912
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:30,167
That means blue, by the way.

913
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:32,628
They escaped. Went to Luiz.

914
01:00:32,837 --> 01:00:34,129
Anything else?

915
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:36,173
They said you were very nice.

916
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:37,758
Did they?

917
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:39,718
Liar.

918
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:41,762
And handsome, too.

919
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:47,142
Never send a monkey to do a bird's job.

920
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:11,750
Don't worry. I got it.

921
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:20,133
There he goes. That's my boy.

922
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:25,847
Is it hot? I think I'm sweating.

923
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:28,975
I didn't even think that
was biologically possible, and yet, look.

924
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,060
Wow.

925
01:01:30,269 --> 01:01:31,937
Yeah, that's your boy, all right.

926
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,855
Okay, so he needs a little help.

927
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,357
Come on, let's give him some.

928
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:37,025
Set the mood.

929
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:42,322
All right, look, I'm on it.
I know how to set the mood. Check it out.

930
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:43,907
Get a, Get a, Get a
Get a girl

931
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:45,409
Get, Get, Get
Get a girl

932
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:48,662
Take her, take her to the floor
Show her, show her how you roll

933
01:01:48,746 --> 01:01:51,832
Drop it, drop it, drop it low
Drop it low, drop-drop it low

934
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:53,417
What kind of mood is that?

935
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:55,085
Pedro, Pedro, a little too aggressive.

936
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:58,213
I'm not hating on your creativity,
but I think I got this one.

937
01:01:58,297 --> 01:01:59,506
Follow my lead.

938
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:09,141
Now, that's more like it.

939
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:19,025
Wasn't really thinking
Wasn't looking

940
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:22,738
Wasn't searching for an answer

941
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:27,242
In the moonlight

942
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:31,913
When I saw your face

943
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:36,126
Wow! What a beautiful sunset.

944
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:37,836
Yeah.

945
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:40,297
Blu.

946
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:44,050
Down here. Just tell her,
"You have beautiful eyes. "

947
01:02:44,218 --> 01:02:45,844
That's good. Great idea.

948
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:49,055
I have beautiful eyes.

949
01:02:50,391 --> 01:02:52,976
Yeah, okay. Sure, they're nice.

950
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:56,146
No, her eyes. Her eyes.

951
01:02:56,397 --> 01:02:59,399
Right, yeah. Your eyes,
your eyes are great, not mine.

952
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:00,650
I mean, mine are okay.

953
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:03,820
But yours, I bet
you can see right through them.

954
01:03:04,822 --> 01:03:06,031
Blu!

955
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:09,201
Just tell her how you feel.

956
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:12,287
- Jewel.
- Yeah.

957
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:15,624
I've been wanting to tell you that I...

958
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:16,917
That I...

959
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:20,796
How sweet. You're getting choked up.

960
01:03:21,005 --> 01:03:23,590
You're choking! Okay! All right!

961
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:29,638
Come on, Blu, move with me.
Stay with me, Blu.

962
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:32,390
One more, come on. One more time!

963
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:35,811
Yep, that's my boy.

964
01:03:49,617 --> 01:03:53,703
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Luiz's garage.

965
01:03:58,167 --> 01:03:59,793
- After you.
- No, no, you first.

966
01:03:59,877 --> 01:04:01,002
Please, I insist.

967
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:02,587
Okay.

968
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:07,717
Guess this is it.

969
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:10,220
Yeah. Quite an adventure.

970
01:04:10,304 --> 01:04:11,680
End of the line.

971
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:12,764
Yes.

972
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:15,267
Guess things like this
don't happen in Tiny-soda.

973
01:04:15,434 --> 01:04:16,726
Tiny-soda?

974
01:04:16,894 --> 01:04:19,229
- Wait, Minnesota.
- Yeah.

975
01:04:19,605 --> 01:04:21,773
That's very good.
That's very funny actually.

976
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:25,068
Luiz! Are you here, Luiz? Hey, buddy!

977
01:04:25,444 --> 01:04:27,904
I got some friends I want you to meet.

978
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:32,117
Go!

979
01:04:32,493 --> 01:04:35,036
Inside, outside, inside, outside!

980
01:04:42,628 --> 01:04:45,171
I got you's good.

981
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:46,840
What?

982
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:50,343
I could've ripped your throats out,
but I didn't.

983
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:53,430
But I could've.

984
01:04:53,514 --> 01:04:56,766
Hey, Luiz! Stop scaring my friends.

985
01:04:56,851 --> 01:04:59,311
Hey, Rafi, come here!

986
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:01,187
Where you've been?

987
01:05:01,355 --> 01:05:02,731
You look good.

988
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:05,942
Wait. Luiz is a bulldog?

989
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:07,944
You got something against dogs?

990
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:09,863
I do when they're drooling on me.

991
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:13,241
It's a medical condition.

992
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:15,076
No, hey, amigo, we really need you.

993
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:17,621
- She's mean, bro.
- Luiz, come on, please, please.

994
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:20,206
We need your help.

995
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:25,045
I think I know what to do.

996
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:34,971
Are you sure this is safe?

997
01:05:35,139 --> 01:05:37,390
Sure. There's nothing to it.

998
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:40,852
Now, if something goes wrong,
scream really loud!

999
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:43,688
Because I can't hear too good
with this thing on.

1000
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:46,191
Hey, Rafi! Get the switch, please.

1001
01:05:46,692 --> 01:05:49,194
Don't worry. He's a professional.

1002
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:56,534
Now, try not to move!

1003
01:05:56,702 --> 01:06:00,246
I can't really see out of this thing, either!

1004
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:24,354
Hey! Where did you go?

1005
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:43,581
Gross.

1006
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:45,875
But I'm free.

1007
01:06:46,043 --> 01:06:47,877
Jewel! Jewel! We're free!

1008
01:06:48,045 --> 01:06:49,462
Slimy, but free.

1009
01:06:49,630 --> 01:06:51,715
Contaminated probably, but free.

1010
01:06:51,882 --> 01:06:53,633
Can you believe it's finally...

1011
01:06:55,928 --> 01:06:57,220
...over.

1012
01:06:58,472 --> 01:06:59,639
Yeah!

1013
01:07:01,225 --> 01:07:03,268
Come on, guys, let's go!

1014
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:06,646
What are we standing around for?
It's Carnaval!

1015
01:07:15,906 --> 01:07:17,407
Oh, yeah!

1016
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:20,869
Yep.

1017
01:07:20,953 --> 01:07:23,079
I know just how you feel.

1018
01:07:23,748 --> 01:07:24,873
Watching them up there

1019
01:07:24,957 --> 01:07:28,251
makes you want to chase them
and grab them in your mouth

1020
01:07:28,419 --> 01:07:30,628
and bite their heads off, huh?

1021
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:35,633
I'm just kidding, bro.

1022
01:07:35,801 --> 01:07:38,011
Yeah, chasing them is plenty.

1023
01:07:48,773 --> 01:07:52,192
I'm flying, flying just like a bird!

1024
01:07:52,359 --> 01:07:54,569
Jewel, but you are a bird!

1025
01:07:58,699 --> 01:08:01,117
Hey! Where you going?

1026
01:08:02,995 --> 01:08:03,995
Blu?

1027
01:08:06,957 --> 01:08:08,208
Blu, what's wrong?

1028
01:08:08,876 --> 01:08:11,086
Nothing. Everything is perfect.

1029
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:14,631
You'll be off to the rainforest, I'll be
back with Linda, just like we planned.

1030
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:18,218
Hey, birds!
Stop yapping and start flapping!

1031
01:08:18,385 --> 01:08:19,469
Let's go!

1032
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:22,263
I guess, I thought, maybe...

1033
01:08:22,348 --> 01:08:24,224
What? That you'd come to Minnesota?

1034
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:26,226
Great, I guess I'll knit you a scarf.

1035
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:28,645
No, that's not what I meant.

1036
01:08:28,729 --> 01:08:30,814
Look, Jewel,
I can't spend my life

1037
01:08:30,898 --> 01:08:33,233
walking around following you
wherever you're going.

1038
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:35,944
Hey, it's not my
fault you can't fly.

1039
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:39,572
Awkward.

1040
01:08:39,657 --> 01:08:40,824
Okay, okay.

1041
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:44,077
You know what? This is good.
Just clear the air.

1042
01:08:44,161 --> 01:08:46,037
Just be completely honest
with each other.

1043
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:48,873
You want honesty?
Fine, I can be honest.

1044
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:50,083
I don't belong here.

1045
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:52,919
In fact, I never wanted to come here
in the first place.

1046
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:55,046
And... And...

1047
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:56,923
And you know what?

1048
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:58,424
I hate samba.

1049
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:03,471
Hey! That's a little too far.

1050
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:05,390
Make the mean bird take it back.

1051
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:07,016
Yeah, I said it.

1052
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:09,352
Every song sounds exactly the same.

1053
01:09:09,436 --> 01:09:12,480
Tico, taco, ya, ya, ya
Tico, taco, ya, ya, ya

1054
01:09:13,774 --> 01:09:15,316
I'm tico, taco out of here.

1055
01:09:15,901 --> 01:09:18,153
Fine! See you around, pet!

1056
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:19,696
No, wait, wait. Come back!

1057
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:23,867
You belong together!
You are Juliet to his Romeo!

1058
01:09:24,201 --> 01:09:27,871
Sure, they both die in the end,
but you get my point!

1059
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:31,374
Young love. Always so melodramatic.

1060
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:34,878
All right, boys, go after her.

1061
01:09:35,921 --> 01:09:39,048
Blu! Come back here. Come on!

1062
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:41,509
Yeah! I'm ready for Carnaval!

1063
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:43,678
Who wants to ride in my

1064
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:45,471
fruit.

1065
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:47,891
You left without me.

1066
01:09:47,975 --> 01:09:49,726
That's messed up.

1067
01:09:55,774 --> 01:09:57,483
Jewels! Jewels!

1068
01:09:57,568 --> 01:09:59,444
Wait up!

1069
01:10:04,408 --> 01:10:06,743
Going somewhere, pretty bird?

1070
01:10:06,827 --> 01:10:10,163
Yeah. I was just on my way
to claw your eyes out!

1071
01:10:10,247 --> 01:10:11,456
Jewel!

1072
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:14,918
Temper, temper.

1073
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:16,419
Now come along, my dear.

1074
01:10:16,503 --> 01:10:18,504
We're going to a parade.

1075
01:10:18,589 --> 01:10:21,925
Everybody loves a parade.

1076
01:10:23,177 --> 01:10:24,552
Let go of me!

1077
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:26,888
Hey! Get back here!

1078
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:30,975
Ain't nobody messing with a friend
of Pedro, I ain't having it!

1079
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,185
It's on!

1080
01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:34,979
Did you see the talons on that guy?

1081
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:36,064
Talons?

1082
01:10:36,148 --> 01:10:38,399
Maybe it's on next time.

1083
01:10:39,693 --> 01:10:41,361
- Help!
- Help! Little help!

1084
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:49,035
Rafael, quit following me.

1085
01:10:49,203 --> 01:10:52,538
You're going in the wrong direction.
Isn't Carnaval that way?

1086
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:54,207
I'm not going to Carnaval.

1087
01:10:54,291 --> 01:10:55,750
No, I'm going home.

1088
01:10:55,834 --> 01:10:57,168
But I thought you loved Carnaval.

1089
01:10:57,544 --> 01:11:00,630
I do. But I love my family much more.

1090
01:11:00,714 --> 01:11:03,591
And that's a choice I made with this.

1091
01:11:03,968 --> 01:11:05,635
Not with this.

1092
01:11:05,719 --> 01:11:07,220
- Blu!
- Hey, Blu! Blu!

1093
01:11:07,471 --> 01:11:09,514
I was flying
and then I saw this big cockatoo!

1094
01:11:09,598 --> 01:11:10,848
With big ninja talons!

1095
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:12,976
This cockatoo was ugly!
Anyway, that's not the point.

1096
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:15,395
And then Jewel was there,
and he snatched Jewel up.

1097
01:11:15,479 --> 01:11:16,896
Like, he snatched her up.
And then he was like,

1098
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:18,648
"You're coming with me,
you little princess. "

1099
01:11:18,732 --> 01:11:20,358
And Jewel was like,

1100
01:11:20,442 --> 01:11:21,818
"I ain't your princess, leave me alone. "

1101
01:11:21,902 --> 01:11:23,486
- And I was like, "What?"
- Then he was like, "What?"

1102
01:11:23,570 --> 01:11:25,071
Stop! Just tell me what happened.

1103
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:26,447
He got Jewel, man!

1104
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:27,991
And he's taking her to the parade.

1105
01:11:28,993 --> 01:11:31,202
This is all my fault.

1106
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:33,579
Let's fly.

1107
01:11:35,874 --> 01:11:38,626
Carnaval, here we come!

1108
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:41,796
Hey, dog, I'm drowning back here!

1109
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:44,716
You will get wet on this ride!

1110
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:50,722
Come on, come on, come on.

1111
01:11:50,889 --> 01:11:53,057
Where are these guys?

1112
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,858
Yes. Nice.

1113
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:03,985
Very nice.

1114
01:12:04,862 --> 01:12:08,031
Marcel!

1115
01:12:09,908 --> 01:12:11,326
Oh, boy.

1116
01:12:12,036 --> 01:12:13,870
We're a chicken!

1117
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:17,290
Come on, Fernando! Dance!

1118
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:21,252
Idiots.

1119
01:12:23,964 --> 01:12:25,089
Excuse me.

1120
01:12:26,467 --> 01:12:27,842
Coming through!

1121
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:29,135
Watch your feet.

1122
01:12:29,219 --> 01:12:30,678
Whoops! Sorry.

1123
01:12:31,513 --> 01:12:33,514
Go ahead. Come in.

1124
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:35,350
Wait. Stop, please.

1125
01:12:35,809 --> 01:12:37,894
Performers only.

1126
01:12:52,451 --> 01:12:53,576
Wow.

1127
01:12:54,119 --> 01:12:56,287
Cyanopsitta spixii.

1128
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:07,256
Tulio?

1129
01:13:08,592 --> 01:13:10,343
Linda. I was just...

1130
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:22,688
I look ridiculous, don't I?

1131
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:39,288
Sorry.

1132
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:42,125
The parade. It's about to start.

1133
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:43,251
Okay.

1134
01:13:43,877 --> 01:13:45,128
Go ahead.

1135
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:47,338
Okay, just follow my lead.

1136
01:13:47,756 --> 01:13:49,590
Act naturally.

1137
01:14:04,898 --> 01:14:05,982
Are you okay?

1138
01:14:06,066 --> 01:14:07,066
- Yeah.
- Come on.

1139
01:14:07,234 --> 01:14:08,776
- Blu?
- Blu!

1140
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:11,779
Blu! Blu!

1141
01:14:13,532 --> 01:14:15,616
What? Wait, wait! No, no.

1142
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:18,953
I am looking for a bluebird. Birdo?

1143
01:14:19,538 --> 01:14:20,705
Birdo! Yes!

1144
01:14:21,331 --> 01:14:22,665
Okay.

1145
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:24,292
Wait! What are you doing?

1146
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:25,585
Tulio!

1147
01:14:25,669 --> 01:14:27,837
Hey! Let me out!

1148
01:14:39,183 --> 01:14:41,017
Tulio!

1149
01:14:42,269 --> 01:14:45,271
This is not good. This is not good. This is...

1150
01:14:48,859 --> 01:14:50,526
Cheese and sprinkles.

1151
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:57,617
Okay, you can bring me down now!

1152
01:14:57,701 --> 01:14:59,577
I think we're done here!

1153
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:10,296
I think they like my moves.

1154
01:15:10,464 --> 01:15:12,924
Hey. Keep dancing, egg-boy.

1155
01:15:17,804 --> 01:15:20,389
One down and one to go.

1156
01:15:20,474 --> 01:15:22,058
You'll never find him.

1157
01:15:22,434 --> 01:15:24,101
He's already gone.

1158
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:25,853
I don't need to find him.

1159
01:15:26,021 --> 01:15:28,147
He'll find you.

1160
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:35,196
This is the spit!

1161
01:15:36,823 --> 01:15:38,032
Yeah, baby!

1162
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,284
Now, I could get my freak on!

1163
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:41,869
Luiz, please!

1164
01:15:41,954 --> 01:15:43,746
Rescue first. Freak later.

1165
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,542
- Come on!
- Out of my way, people!

1166
01:15:51,255 --> 01:15:52,255
All right, guys!

1167
01:15:52,422 --> 01:15:54,215
I'll fly ahead and look for Jewel.

1168
01:15:56,301 --> 01:15:57,593
Hello, ladies.

1169
01:15:59,304 --> 01:16:01,556
Mr. Big-nose! Hold up!

1170
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:07,228
What?

1171
01:16:08,772 --> 01:16:10,439
Linda? Excuse me. Excuse me.

1172
01:16:10,607 --> 01:16:14,777
Linda!

1173
01:16:19,116 --> 01:16:20,199
In English!

1174
01:16:20,534 --> 01:16:23,536
Linda! Linda!
You've got to shake your tushy!

1175
01:16:23,787 --> 01:16:26,831
No! We don't shake our tushies
in Minnesota!

1176
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,836
Hot dog! Coming through!

1177
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:35,673
Blu!

1178
01:16:37,342 --> 01:16:40,261
Tulio! Tulio! I saw Blu!

1179
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:42,013
What?

1180
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:46,309
Hold on, Blu! I'm coming for you!

1181
01:16:57,821 --> 01:17:00,406
Blu!

1182
01:17:00,782 --> 01:17:01,824
Linda!

1183
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:03,200
Linda?

1184
01:17:03,368 --> 01:17:04,368
Wait!

1185
01:17:10,167 --> 01:17:11,584
Blu, we found them!

1186
01:17:11,668 --> 01:17:13,586
She's on some weird chicken float!

1187
01:17:13,754 --> 01:17:14,920
Come on!

1188
01:17:17,507 --> 01:17:18,549
Let's go get Jewel.

1189
01:17:18,759 --> 01:17:21,135
Wait, Blu! Where are you going?

1190
01:17:26,391 --> 01:17:27,391
Okay.

1191
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:39,445
I saw Blu! He's riding on a bulldog!

1192
01:17:39,529 --> 01:17:40,529
What?

1193
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:44,492
There they are! That's the float!

1194
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:48,788
That float is a crime in itself!

1195
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:04,178
There he is!

1196
01:18:18,485 --> 01:18:20,194
- Hey, Jewel.
- Blu!

1197
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:21,654
- I'm gonna get you out of here.
- No.

1198
01:18:21,738 --> 01:18:24,615
No, Blu, you can't be here.
You have to go. Nigel...

1199
01:18:26,451 --> 01:18:27,952
Hello, pretty bird.

1200
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:31,622
So kind of you to join our little soirée.

1201
01:18:31,748 --> 01:18:33,332
Come on. You really think I came alone?

1202
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:35,501
I got three of the roughest, meanest

1203
01:18:35,627 --> 01:18:38,129
craziest birds in all of Rio
right behind me.

1204
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:41,424
You heard that, guys? We're saved!

1205
01:18:41,633 --> 01:18:44,427
- That's right. That's right.
- I think he means us.

1206
01:18:45,804 --> 01:18:50,725
Love. It's such a powerful and stupid thing.

1207
01:18:58,358 --> 01:19:01,152
Yes. Well done, Nigel.

1208
01:19:04,906 --> 01:19:07,199
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1209
01:19:07,367 --> 01:19:08,367
Out of the way.

1210
01:19:09,202 --> 01:19:11,537
Sorry. Wait! Wait!

1211
01:19:12,831 --> 01:19:15,207
We actually made it! Hey, Marcel!

1212
01:19:15,375 --> 01:19:17,668
Can we do this again next year?
Please? Please?

1213
01:19:17,794 --> 01:19:19,462
Could I drive next year, too?

1214
01:19:21,006 --> 01:19:22,506
Wait! Come back!

1215
01:19:28,805 --> 01:19:29,889
Get in!

1216
01:19:32,851 --> 01:19:37,563
I don't know how I got up here,
but I ain't never coming down!

1217
01:19:47,324 --> 01:19:48,741
Come on, kid.

1218
01:19:58,585 --> 01:20:00,961
I'm gonna get you guys out of here.

1219
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:02,713
- What do you think you're doing?
- Nothing.

1220
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:05,257
You shouldn't have done that.
Come on.

1221
01:20:14,643 --> 01:20:15,726
Just forget him!

1222
01:20:15,894 --> 01:20:17,144
Get the birds!

1223
01:20:21,358 --> 01:20:22,358
They're getting away.

1224
01:20:24,110 --> 01:20:26,111
We'll see about that.

1225
01:20:29,991 --> 01:20:31,325
Watch out!

1226
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:38,040
We did it, boys.

1227
01:20:38,124 --> 01:20:40,334
- Yes! We did it.
- We're the best!

1228
01:20:40,418 --> 01:20:42,503
Is that a float?

1229
01:20:43,213 --> 01:20:45,631
Wow! Look at the detail on that thing.

1230
01:20:45,799 --> 01:20:47,424
Pull up you, idiot! Pull up!

1231
01:21:00,772 --> 01:21:03,566
Blu! Blu!

1232
01:21:05,068 --> 01:21:06,360
Oh, Blu.

1233
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:27,631
Sorry, Eva,
I'm not gonna be home for dinner.

1234
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:36,390
What are you doing?

1235
01:21:36,474 --> 01:21:39,393
I'm gonna pop this cage open
like a soda can.

1236
01:21:47,694 --> 01:21:49,320
Now, that's popping!

1237
01:21:50,071 --> 01:21:51,697
Hurry. We got to help the others.

1238
01:21:52,157 --> 01:21:54,992
I'm a pretty bird, I'm a pretty bird.
Who's a pretty bird? I'm a pretty bird.

1239
01:21:55,076 --> 01:21:56,911
Pretty bird, I'm a pretty bird.

1240
01:21:57,913 --> 01:21:59,038
Come on!

1241
01:22:02,792 --> 01:22:03,792
I'm out!

1242
01:22:19,225 --> 01:22:20,225
The light!

1243
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:28,901
Go! Go! Go!

1244
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:30,444
Freedom!

1245
01:22:30,862 --> 01:22:32,279
Geronimo!

1246
01:22:37,118 --> 01:22:38,535
Come on! Come on!
We need to get out!

1247
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:40,371
Wait, wait, wait!

1248
01:22:44,793 --> 01:22:47,753
It's okay. Hey, it's okay.

1249
01:22:47,921 --> 01:22:51,006
We'll figure this out together. Right?

1250
01:22:54,594 --> 01:22:55,636
Let him go!

1251
01:22:59,349 --> 01:23:00,015
Jewel!

1252
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:01,600
My wing.

1253
01:23:02,519 --> 01:23:03,519
Pity.

1254
01:23:03,603 --> 01:23:06,772
Now we have two useless,
flightless birds.

1255
01:23:13,863 --> 01:23:15,781
Not cool, man. Not cool!

1256
01:23:27,168 --> 01:23:29,336
We're going down!

1257
01:23:30,714 --> 01:23:32,464
- Okay, okay.
- Rock, paper, scissors...

1258
01:23:32,632 --> 01:23:33,757
Chute!

1259
01:23:34,467 --> 01:23:36,593
Hasta la vista, losers!

1260
01:23:37,595 --> 01:23:38,595
Hey! Wait for us!

1261
01:23:39,764 --> 01:23:41,223
Cannonball!

1262
01:23:44,936 --> 01:23:46,145
Blu!

1263
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:47,438
No!

1264
01:24:02,996 --> 01:24:06,123
Blu, you're crazy! What are you doing?

1265
01:24:06,207 --> 01:24:07,750
I'm not gonna let you go!

1266
01:24:07,917 --> 01:24:10,794
We're chained-to-each-other birds,
remember?

1267
01:24:30,774 --> 01:24:31,940
Wow.

1268
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:34,943
Blu! You're flying!

1269
01:24:35,028 --> 01:24:36,153
Yeah!

1270
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:39,156
I'm flying! I'm really flying.

1271
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:43,118
You're right, I'm not an ostrich.
I'm not an ostrich!

1272
01:24:48,124 --> 01:24:49,249
What?

1273
01:24:58,051 --> 01:24:59,134
Dad! Look!

1274
01:25:04,599 --> 01:25:06,100
Idiots.

1275
01:25:12,315 --> 01:25:13,565
Linda!

1276
01:25:16,319 --> 01:25:17,778
Blu?

1277
01:25:18,029 --> 01:25:20,572
It's Blu! Look, Tulio, it's Blu!

1278
01:25:20,657 --> 01:25:22,116
And he's flying.

1279
01:25:22,367 --> 01:25:24,076
My Blu is flying!

1280
01:25:24,202 --> 01:25:24,993
He's flying.

1281
01:25:41,886 --> 01:25:43,887
Here, let me see.

1282
01:25:47,934 --> 01:25:48,934
Don't worry.

1283
01:25:49,144 --> 01:25:50,894
I'll take care of you.

1284
01:26:21,926 --> 01:26:34,187
That's my big, brave boy.

1285
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:41,361
All the birds of a feather

1286
01:26:42,488 --> 01:26:44,948
Do what we love most of all

1287
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:49,161
Moon and the stars
Strumming guitars

1288
01:26:49,329 --> 01:26:53,582
That's why we love Carnaval

1289
01:26:57,962 --> 01:27:01,506
Loving our life in the jungle

1290
01:27:01,591 --> 01:27:04,843
Everything's wild and free

1291
01:27:05,011 --> 01:27:08,430
Never alone
'Cause this is our home

1292
01:27:08,514 --> 01:27:11,600
Magic can happen for real

1293
01:27:11,768 --> 01:27:13,435
In Rio

1294
01:27:13,686 --> 01:27:15,646
All by itself

1295
01:27:15,772 --> 01:27:16,855
By itself

1296
01:27:16,981 --> 01:27:20,275
You can't see it coming

1297
01:27:20,485 --> 01:27:22,277
You can't find it anywhere else

1298
01:27:22,695 --> 01:27:24,112
I'm the capoeira king-a

1299
01:27:24,197 --> 01:27:25,197
King-a, king-a, king-a

1300
01:27:25,281 --> 01:27:25,822
King-a!

1301
01:27:25,907 --> 01:27:27,574
Birds like me 'cause I'm a hot wing-a

1302
01:27:27,659 --> 01:27:29,326
Pedro, hot-a-wing-a

1303
01:27:29,452 --> 01:27:31,745
Here everybody loves samba

1304
01:27:31,829 --> 01:27:32,871
I like the samba

1305
01:27:32,956 --> 01:27:34,915
Rhythm you feel in your heart

1306
01:27:34,999 --> 01:27:36,333
I'm the samba master

1307
01:27:36,417 --> 01:27:39,503
Beauty and love
What more could you want?

1308
01:27:39,879 --> 01:27:42,965
Fantasy can be for real

1309
01:27:43,132 --> 01:27:44,841
In Rio

1310
01:27:45,009 --> 01:27:46,885
Here's something else

1311
01:27:47,053 --> 01:27:48,178
Something else

1312
01:27:48,304 --> 01:27:51,640
You just feel it happening

1313
01:27:51,766 --> 01:27:55,102
You won't find it anywhere else

1314
01:27:55,353 --> 01:27:57,938
I love you, Rio!

1315
01:27:58,305 --> 01:28:58,715
