2
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,726
Boys, let's do this!

3
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,723
Gray?

4
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,888
Honey, what are you doing?

5
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,565
What is this? Here. Let's go.

6
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,643
Come on, honey.
Your flight's in two hours.

7
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,083
Dane County Airport is 36 minutes away,
60 with traffic.

8
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,851
How many minutes to get
your little butt in the van?

9
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,961
Hmm?

10
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,086
How many of those?

11
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,088
- Feed the monster under your bed?
- Yes.

12
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,845
Call me every day, and text me pics,
so I don't forget what you look like.

13
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,100
I'm only gonna be gone a week.

14
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,247
Zach.

15
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,766
You're not going off
to war here. Please.

16
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,140
Come on.

17
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,084
- I will see you later.
- I love you.

18
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,241
Vámonos.

19
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,283
- Bye, okay?
- Bye.

20
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,528
Are you in, buddy?

21
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,611
I know it hurts, sweetheart.

22
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,085
Are you gonna be okay?

23
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,121
Everything right on there?

24
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,420
I'm so jealous.

25
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,220
You're gonna have so much fun.
I love you.

26
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,924
I love you, too.

27
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,540
Okay, great.

28
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,564
All right, um, let's give these
to your brother, okay?

29
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,420
- You hold these, please. Can you hold these?
- Zach.

30
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,170
Honey, I need you to take care of these.

31
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,060
Yeah.

32
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,161
- Hey.
- All right.

33
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,481
Listen to your mother.

34
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,080
Take care of your brother.
Answer your phone.

35
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,860
I'm serious. It's the green button.

36
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,940
When you see my name, push it, okay?

37
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,045
And remember, something chases you, run.

38
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,201
Come on.

39
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,060
- All right.
- You're funny. Okay, let's go. Come on.

40
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,700
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

41
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,564
- I miss you already.
- Yeah.

42
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,371
So much for our last family breakfast.

43
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,681
Why do you have to say things like that?

44
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,060
Did you call your sister?

45
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,162
Straight to voicemail.

46
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,489
It'll be fine. She handles
20,000 people a day, right?

47
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,489
She can handle two more.

48
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,940
How big is the island?

49
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,740
Big.

50
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,340
But how many pounds?

51
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,805
That doesn't make sense.

52
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,965
When they first opened,
they had eight species.

53
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,940
Now they have 14 herbivores
and six carnivores.

54
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,804
That's 50 tons of food a week.

55
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,007
Welcome to Isla Nublar,
home of Jurassic World.

56
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,010
We hope you have a safe
and enjoyable stay with us.

57
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,889
Where's Aunt Claire?

58
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,300
Okay. Those of you
in the front of the train

59
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,607
should be able to see our main gates.

60
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,820
Please obey all park rules.

61
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,700
Proper attire, including shoes
and shirts, must be worn at all times.

62
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,580
Your aunt arranged to greet you
at 1:00. Can he slow down?

63
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,700
Nope.

64
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,450
Come on!

65
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,482
Your aunt's got you VIP access,

66
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,961
so you can get in all the rides
without waiting in line.

67
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,140
Let's go.

68
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,220
Dude, she said we had to wait.

69
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,243
I don't wanna wait anymore.

70
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,688
Hal Osterly, vice president.
Jim Drucker, bad hair.

71
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,208
Erica Brand, deserves better.

72
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,980
Hal, Jim, Erica. Hal, Jim, Erica.

73
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,560
And I am Claire.

74
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,250
Three minutes late.

75
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,167
Welcome to Jurassic World.

76
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,980
While year over year,
revenue continues to climb,

77
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,300
operating costs are higher than ever.

78
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,100
Our shareholders have been patient,
but let's be honest,

79
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,260
no one is impressed
by a dinosaur anymore.

80
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,460
Twenty years ago, de-extinction
was right up there with magic.

81
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,727
These days, kids look at a Stegosaurus
like an elephant from the city zoo.

82
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,167
That doesn't mean asset development
is falling behind.

83
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,611
Our DNA excavators discover
new species every year.

84
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,248
But consumers want them bigger,
louder, more teeth.

85
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,365
The good news?

86
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,529
Our advances in gene splicing
have opened up a whole new frontier.

87
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,540
We've learned more from genetics
in the past decade

88
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,642
than a century of digging up bones.

89
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,601
So,

90
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,881
when you say you want to sponsor
an attraction, what do you have in mind?

91
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,140
We want to be thrilled.

92
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,730
Don't we all?

93
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,300
The Indominus rex.

94
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,140
Our first genetically modified hybrid.

95
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,642
How did you get two different kinds
of dinosaurs to, you know...

96
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,167
Oh, Indominus wasn't bred.
She was designed.

97
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,487
She will be 50 feet
long when fully grown.

98
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,250
Bigger than the T. rex.

99
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,060
Every time we've unveiled a new asset,
attendance has spiked.

100
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,940
Global news coverage,
celebrity visitors.

101
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,451
Eyes of the world.

102
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,164
When will she be ready?

103
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,208
She already is.

104
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,366
Come on!

105
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,561
Relax.

106
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,167
Come on.

107
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,203
Dude, chill.

108
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,849
Welcome to the Innovation Center,

109
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,406
where technology meets prehistory.

110
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,086
The Triceratops can go horn-to-tooth
with the apex predators.

111
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,443
Literally meaning
"three-horned face" in Greek,

112
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,644
Triceratops is half as tall as T. rex

113
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,651
...as one-hundred trillion tons of TNT.

114
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,900
...turn its head back
to look over its shoulder

115
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,322
to better aim the swing
of its dangerous tail.

116
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,660
Cytosine, guanine, adenine, and thymine.

117
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,364
The same four things in
everything that ever lived.

118
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,020
Hey, don't wander off, all right?

119
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,202
Mom's not paying me for babysitting.

120
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,780
Gray, is that you?

121
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,860
Aunt Claire!

122
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,008
Okay, yeah. No, I'm gonna have to go.
My nephews are here.

123
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,620
Hi.

124
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,926
Oh.

125
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,487
Oh, my gosh, you're so sweet.

126
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,727
Whoa, Zach.

127
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,060
Last time I saw you, you were like...

128
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,340
That must've been what?

129
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,580
- Three, four years ago?
- Uh, Seven.

130
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,569
Seven years, but, you know, close.

131
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,327
So, I see you already
got your wristbands.

132
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,860
And this is for food.

133
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,406
And Zara here is going
to take great care of you

134
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,180
until I'm done working tonight, okay?

135
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,691
You're not coming with us?

136
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,601
Oh...

137
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,860
I really wish that I could,

138
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,940
but tomorrow I can take you
into the control room,

139
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,088
show you behind the
scenes and all of that.

140
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,851
That's gonna be cool, right?

141
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,860
Okay, so I will see you tonight at 6:00.

142
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,180
No, don't forget you have the...

143
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,380
Right, of course.
I will see you tonight at 8:00.

144
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,180
What time do you go to sleep?
Or do you go to sleep at different times?

145
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,731
Okay, so, have fun,

146
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,411
and take very good care of them, okay?

147
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,528
Yeah. No, I'm here.

148
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,449
It's those two juvenile Triceratops.
They're going at it again.

149
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,290
Should I tranq them, or are you
coming over to take care of this?

150
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,180
- Go ahead and tranq them.
- They're running.

151
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,900
What's the live count?

152
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,740
22,216.

153
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,980
- Any incidents?
- Yes.

154
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,020
Six kids in the Lost and Found,
28 down with heatstroke...

155
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,340
Where did you get that?

156
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,860
Oh, this? I got it on eBay.
Yeah, it's pretty amazing.

157
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,260
I got it for $150, but the mint
condition one goes for $300...

158
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,500
Didn't occur to you maybe
that's in poor taste?

159
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,220
The shirt? Yeah, no, it did.

160
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,008
I understand people died. It was terrible,
but that first park was legit.

161
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,980
I have a lot of respect for it.

162
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,740
They didn't need these genetic hybrids.

163
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,729
They just needed dinosaurs,
real dinosaurs.

164
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,900
- Okay, please don't wear it again.
- That's kind of enough.

165
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,100
Yeah, I wasn't gonna.

166
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,940
- Did you close the deal?
- Looks like it.

167
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,940
Verizon Wireless
presents the Indominus rex.

168
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,485
Ugh, that is so terrible.

169
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,700
Why not just go the distance, Claire,

170
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,531
and just let these corporations
name the dinosaurs?

171
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,846
They've got all the ballparks.

172
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,300
- Why stop there?
- Why are the West Plains closed?

173
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,740
Another Pachy roaming outside his zone.

174
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,922
But he's fully sedated
and ready for relocation.

175
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,780
Pepsi-saurus or Tostito-don.

176
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,940
Security said the invisible fences
were a no-fail.

177
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,620
That is the second time this month.

178
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,042
Well, the Pachys short out
their implants when they butt heads.

179
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,180
How much longer until
they get it out of there?

180
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,540
He just got five
milligrams of carfentanil.

181
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:27,043
Yes, he's very stoned.
So why don't we show a little sympathy?

182
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,403
I mean, you do understand
these are actual animals, right?

183
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,220
Clean up your workspace. It's chaotic.

184
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,460
I like to think of
it as a living system.

185
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,009
Just enough stability to keep it
from collapsing into anarchy.

186
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,366
Inbound chopper, Jurassic 1.
ETA, 5 minutes.

187
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,881
Claire.

188
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,780
Mr. Masrani. You are flying.

189
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,405
I got my license.

190
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,700
- Two more.
- Well, two more days.

191
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,926
- Okay.
- So,

192
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,042
- how's my park doing?
- Great.

193
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,128
We're up 2.5% over last year.

194
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,288
A bit lower than our initial projection.

195
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,780
No, no, no, how's it doing?

196
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,020
Are the guests having fun?
Are the animals enjoying life?

197
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,660
Well, guest satisfaction
is steady in the low 90s.

198
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,300
We don't have a way to measure
the animals' emotional experience.

199
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,980
Sure you do. You can see in their eyes.

200
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,300
Right?

201
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,811
Of course.

202
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,925
Okay. Now show me my new dinosaur.

203
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,244
Oh...

204
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,404
Got it.

205
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,410
Got it.

206
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,568
Oh, my!

207
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,046
You look tense, Claire.

208
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,608
Maybe you should just
focus on the controls.

209
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,940
The key to a happy life is to accept

210
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,725
you are never actually in control.

211
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,887
Bird!

212
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,442
You should spend a day
at the beach. Get some sun.

213
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,020
Uh, right, so...

214
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,806
Marketing thought we could offset
some of the costs by...

215
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,940
Enough about cost.

216
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,168
John Hammond entrusted me
with his dying wish,

217
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,380
and not once did he mention profits.

218
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,580
"Spare no expense," he used to say.

219
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,207
I appreciate that, but the reality
of operating a theme park requires...

220
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,300
Don't forget why we
built this place, Claire.

221
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,722
Jurassic World exists to remind us
how very small we are.

222
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,844
How new. You can't put a price on that.

223
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,328
Now, please, we're flying.

224
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,203
Breathe.

225
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,460
Is he okay? Are you okay?

226
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,900
He's just being dramatic.

227
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,809
Are you still building?

228
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,340
We planned to open in May,

229
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,180
but Asset Containment insisted
we build the walls up higher.

230
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,362
It's bigger than expected.

231
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,925
It's a good sign.

232
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,660
We hit a few speed bumps early on.

233
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,889
It began to anticipate
where the food would come from.

234
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,860
One of the handlers nearly lost an arm.

235
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,885
The others threatened to quit
if I couldn't guarantee their safety.

236
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,209
She's intelligent then?

237
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,409
For a dinosaur.

238
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,568
And that?

239
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,804
It tried to break the glass.

240
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,928
I like her spirit.

241
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,841
It's white. You never
told me it was white.

242
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,442
Think it will scare the kids?

243
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,204
The kids?

244
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,368
This will give the parents nightmares.

245
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,484
Is that good?

246
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,607
It's fantastic.

247
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,404
Can she see us?

248
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,180
They say it can sense thermal radiation.

249
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,611
Like snakes.

250
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,688
I thought there were two of them.

251
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,220
There was a sibling in case
this one didn't survive infancy.

252
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,322
Where's the sibling?

253
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,487
She ate it.

254
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,326
So, the paddock is quite safe, then?

255
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,980
We have the best structural
engineers in the world.

256
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,161
Yeah, so did Hammond.

257
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,300
There's an American Navy man here.

258
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,370
Part of a research program
one of my companies is running.

259
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,130
Owen Grady.

260
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,401
I know who he is.

261
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,420
His animals often try to escape.

262
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,420
They are smart. He has to be smarter.

263
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,249
He only thinks he's smarter.

264
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,689
I want you to bring him in.

265
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,765
Let him inspect the paddock.

266
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,326
Maybe he sees something we can't.

267
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,210
Hold!

268
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,121
Hey!

269
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,881
Okay!

270
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,860
Eyes on me.

271
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,500
Blue?

272
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,284
Blue!

273
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,166
Watch it.

274
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,521
Charlie. Hey!

275
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,340
Don't give me that shit!

276
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,540
Delta!

277
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,085
Lock it up!

278
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,683
Good!

279
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,928
And we're moving!

280
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,971
Hold!

281
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,082
That's good. That is damn good.

282
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,967
Very good!

283
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,447
See, Charlie, that's what you get!

284
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,242
Echo, there you go! Delta!

285
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,081
Blue?

286
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,602
This one's for you.

287
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,606
Hold!

288
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,567
Eyes up!

289
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,881
Go.

290
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,521
You finally did it, man.

291
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,641
Owen.

292
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,700
I was starting to think
I hired the wrong guys,

293
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,780
but, damn, you got them
eating out of your palm.

294
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,020
You came on a good day.
It's not usually a happy ending.

295
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,860
Is that why you're not
sending in your reports?

296
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,340
We've been busy.

297
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,046
Not too busy to cash your paychecks.

298
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,165
What do you need, buddy?

299
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,921
A field test.

300
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,380
Hey. I've just seen they
can respond to commands.

301
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,900
We need to take the research
and get it on its feet.

302
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,340
These are wild animals, Hoskins.

303
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,260
Trust me, you don't
want them in the field.

304
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,540
I just saw a bond. A real bond.

305
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,740
Between man and beast.

306
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,820
You're in my way.

307
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,260
Come on. We're the same.

308
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,850
We're dogs of war.

309
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,980
We know that the military
needs to reduce casualties.

310
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,060
Some people think that
robots are the future.

311
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,700
Look, nature gave us the most effective

312
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,371
killing machines 75 million years ago.

313
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,900
And now we know they can take orders.

314
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,660
We finally make progress
and that's the first thing he says?

315
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,364
Make a weapon?

316
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,780
Shit.

317
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,245
Come on, gents.

318
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,340
It's grown-up time.

319
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,140
Drones can't search tunnels and caves.
And they're hackable.

320
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,940
The minute a real war breaks out,
all that fancy tech is gonna go dark.

321
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,044
But that tech's not gonna eat them
if they forget to feed it.

322
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,500
Look at these creatures.

323
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,420
They've got millions of years
of instinct in their cells,

324
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,601
instinct that we can program.

325
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,167
Their loyalty cannot be bought.

326
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,408
These guys are gonna run straight
into the enemy's teeth and eat them,

327
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,460
belt buckle and all.

328
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,961
What if they decide
they wanna be in control?

329
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,211
Well, then we remind them who is.
We terminate the rogues.

330
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,567
Promote only loyal bloodlines.

331
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,087
What? What's so funny?

332
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,420
I don't know. You come here

333
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,844
and you don't learn anything about these
animals except what you want to know.

334
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,686
You made them,
and now you think you own them.

335
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,490
We do own them.

336
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,402
Extinct animals have no rights.

337
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,300
They're not extinct anymore, Hoskins.

338
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,660
Exactly. We're sitting on a goldmine.

339
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,128
And Masrani is using it
to stock a petting zoo.

340
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,020
He just wants to teach people
some humility. He doesn't make weapons.

341
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,820
You think that the eighth
richest man in the world

342
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:23,420
is only into oil, telecom,
and family fun parks?

343
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,340
He's so diversified,
he doesn't even know what he owns.

344
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,647
How long has InGen
been practicing this pitch?

345
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,765
Since the day we hired you
out of the Navy. You knew the end game.

346
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,660
These animals can replace thousands
of boots on the ground.

347
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,762
How many lives would that save?

348
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,566
War is part of nature.

349
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,244
Look around, Owen.
Every living thing in this jungle

350
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,850
is trying to murder the other.

351
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,020
Mother Nature's way of
testing her creations.

352
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,540
Refining the pecking order.

353
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,769
War is a struggle.
Struggle breeds greatness.

354
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,050
Without that, we end up with places
like this, charge seven bucks a soda.

355
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,209
Do you hear yourself when you talk?

356
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,885
This is gonna happen.
With or without you boys.

357
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,451
Progress always wins, man.

358
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,380
Maybe progress should lose for once.

359
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,845
Pig loose!

360
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,163
Pig loose!

361
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,721
Owen, no!

362
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,324
No, hold your fire!

363
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,207
Hold your fire. Do not fire.

364
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,285
Put 12 amps in these animals,
they're never gonna trust me again.

365
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,126
Blue, stand down.

366
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,087
Stand down.

367
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,686
Hey! What did I just say?

368
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,161
Delta, I see you. Back up!

369
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,700
Okay.

370
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,926
Good.

371
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,121
Good.

372
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,721
Charlie?

373
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,521
Stay right there.

374
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,490
Good.

375
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,321
Close the gate.

376
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,530
Are you crazy?

377
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,540
Just trust me.

378
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,721
Close the gate!

379
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,566
I'm okay.

380
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,806
Yeah.

381
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,726
You're the new guy, right?

382
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,401
Yeah.

383
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,921
You ever wonder why
there was a job opening?

384
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,060
Hey.

385
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,766
Don't ever turn your back to the cage.

386
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,848
Lift me up. I can't see!

387
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,168
I'm not Dad. And you're not five.

388
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,526
I can still ride the Triceratops.
I'm 47-and-a-half inches.

389
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,846
This place is for little kids.

390
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,700
Yeah, I know.

391
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,087
- Wanna go on the spinning dinosaur eggs?
- Nope.

392
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,288
Cover up your dork pouch.

393
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,005
Because it's my wedding.

394
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,361
No, Alec's not having a bachelor party.

395
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,130
Because all his friends are animals.

396
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,361
Scatter.

397
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,687
- What?
- Go. Run. Go!

398
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,961
Yuck!

399
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,162
The next T. rex feeding
will begin in 10 minutes.

400
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,169
- T. rex! Come on, man! Come on!
- Okay.

401
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,566
Let's go!

402
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,648
Parents be aware, this show
may be disturbing for smaller children.

403
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,780
Hey, Mom.

404
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,940
You were supposed
to call me when you landed.

405
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,166
Are you having fun?

406
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,124
Yeah, I guess.

407
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,605
Aunt Claire gave us passes,
so we don't have to wait in line.

408
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,165
Wait, she's not with you?

409
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,401
Hey, Karen!

410
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,523
Hi, Claire. How's it going?

411
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,140
Yeah, everything's great.
The boys are having fun.

412
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,860
Everyone's... Yeah, everyone's good.

413
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,420
Really? Because I
just hung up with Zach,

414
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,329
and he said that you
weren't even with them.

415
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,930
Yeah, look. Today turned out
to be a really bad day for me.

416
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,521
They're in great hands.
They're with my assistant.

417
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,690
She's British, so they invented nannies.

418
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,600
Wait, are you crying?

419
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,884
This was supposed to be
a family weekend, Claire.

420
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,491
You haven't seen the boys in forever.

421
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,762
And I know how Zach will treat Gray
if they're by themselves.

422
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,928
And he can just be so mean.

423
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,929
Okay, I'm sorry.

424
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,647
Tomorrow, I'm gonna spend
the entire day with them.

425
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,220
I'm going to take off work,
and I will not leave their side.

426
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,460
I promise.

427
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,042
Well, a promise tomorrow
is worth a lot less than trying today.

428
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,970
Ew! You're using Mom's lines now?

429
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,460
Oh, my God. I am using Mom's lines.

430
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,449
I'm sorry, but you know,
I have to tell you, they work.

431
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,260
You'll see when you have kids.

432
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,441
Yeah, "if."

433
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:31,008
"When." It's worth it.

434
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,810
Bye, Mom.

435
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,721
Bye.

436
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,770
What do they want now?

437
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,967
Mr. Grady?

438
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,807
I need you to come
take a look at something.

439
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,283
Why are you calling me Mr. Grady?

440
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,811
Owen.

441
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,740
If you're not too busy.

442
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,940
I'm pretty busy.

443
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,580
We have an attraction.

444
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,580
That's not what you said
the last time I saw you.

445
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,921
I'm talking about
the dinosaurs, Mr. Grady.

446
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,525
Owen.

447
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,722
A new species we've made.

448
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,820
You just went and made a new dinosaur?

449
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,003
Yeah, it's kind of what we do here.

450
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,884
The exhibit opens to the public
in three weeks.

451
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:36,100
Mr. Masrani wanted me
to consult with you.

452
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,444
You wanna consult
here or in my bungalow?

453
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,970
That's not funny.

454
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,045
A little funny.

455
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,980
We'd like you to evaluate
the paddock for vulnerabilities.

456
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,730
Why me?

457
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:56,521
I guess Mr. Masrani thinks,
since you're able to control the Raptors...

458
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,940
It's all about control with you.

459
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:01,249
I don't control the Raptors.
It's a relationship.

460
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,567
It's based on mutual respect.

461
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,762
That's why you and I never
had a second date.

462
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,660
Excuse me? I never wanted a second date.

463
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,728
Who prints out an itinerary
for a night out?

464
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,410
I'm an organized person.

465
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,020
What kind of a diet
doesn't allow tequila?

466
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,804
All of them, actually.

467
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:22,289
And what kind of a man shows up
to a date in board shorts?

468
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,442
- It's Central America. It's hot.
- Okay. Okay.

469
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,450
Can we just focus on the asset, please?

470
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,965
The asset?

471
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,820
Look, I get it.
You're in charge out here.

472
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,140
You gotta make a lot of tough decisions.

473
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,060
It's probably easier to pretend these
animals are just numbers on a spreadsheet.

474
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,845
But they're not. They're alive.

475
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,602
I'm fully aware they're alive.

476
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,405
You might have made them in a test tube,
but they don't know that.

477
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,722
They're thinking, "I gotta eat.

478
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,284
"I gotta hunt. I gotta..."

479
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,847
You can relate to at
least one of those things.

480
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,126
Right?

481
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,921
I'll be in the car.

482
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,180
You might want to change your shirt.

483
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,489
They're very sensitive to smell.

484
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,966
The Mosasaurus was thought to have hunted
near the surface of the water

485
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,323
where it preyed on anything
it could sink its teeth into,

486
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:35,970
including turtles, large fish,
even smaller Mosasaurs.

487
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:40,848
Okay, folks, let's see if she's still hungry
after already eating today.

488
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:45,565
She's a little shy, so be nice
and give her a hand when she comes out.

489
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,290
Zach, Zach!

490
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,168
The Mosasaurus!

491
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,046
Oh, my God! That was awesome!

492
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,420
Hold on tight.

493
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,809
We're gonna give you an even
closer look at our Mosasaurus.

494
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,690
It had 88 teeth!

495
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,801
- Wanna see something else cool?
- Yeah!

496
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,209
We've been pre-booking tickets
for months.

497
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,100
The park needs a new attraction
every few years

498
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,460
in order to reinvigorate
the public's interest.

499
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,460
Kind of like the space program.

500
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:53,121
Corporate felt genetic modification
would up the wow factor.

501
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,288
They're dinosaurs. Wow enough.

502
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,740
Not according to our focus groups.

503
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,081
The Indominus rex
makes us relevant again.

504
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,180
The Indominus rex?

505
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,329
We needed something scary
and easy to pronounce.

506
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,962
You should hear a four-year-old
try to say "Archaeornithomimus."

507
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,321
You should hear you try to say it.

508
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,484
So what's this thing made of?

509
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,940
The base genome is a T. rex.
The rest is classified.

510
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,740
You made a new dinosaur,
but you don't even know what it is?

511
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:30,245
The lab delivers us finished assets,
and we show them to the public.

512
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,323
Can we drop a steer, please?

513
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,329
How long has the animal been in here?

514
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,380
All its life.

515
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,767
Never seen anything
outside of these walls?

516
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,166
We can't exactly walk it.

517
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,805
And you feed it with that?

518
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,804
Is there a problem?

519
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,283
Animals raised in isolation
aren't always the most functional.

520
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,860
Your Raptors are born in captivity.

521
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,420
With siblings. They learn social skills.

522
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,170
And I imprint on them when they're born.

523
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,580
There's trust.

524
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:06,810
The only positive relationship
this animal has is with that crane.

525
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,285
At least she knows that means food.

526
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,330
So, she needs a friend.

527
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,808
We should schedule play-dates?
That sort of thing?

528
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,724
Probably not a good idea.

529
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,220
Where is it?

530
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,481
Is it in the basement?

531
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:28,008
Is there a downstairs?
Maybe it's in the rec room.

532
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,322
It was just here. We were just here.

533
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,003
Oh, shit.

534
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,882
That doesn't make any sense.

535
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,808
These doors haven't
been opened in weeks.

536
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,448
Were those claw marks always there?

537
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,841
Do you think it...

538
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,569
Oh, God.

539
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,340
She has an implant in her back.

540
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,125
I can track it from the control room.

541
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,564
We have an asset out of containment.

542
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,326
Put ACU on alert. This is not a drill.

543
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,131
Even though I didn't
meet him until I was 13,

544
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,460
I definitely consider Carl to be more
of a dad than my real dad.

545
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,329
- Yeah, hello?
- Lowery.

546
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,164
Get me coordinates on the Indominus.

547
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,607
Okay, yeah.

548
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,246
I'm doing it right now.

549
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,368
That wall is 40 feet high.

550
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,325
Do you really think
she could have climbed out?

551
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,340
It depends.

552
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,726
On what?

553
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:20,244
What kind of dinosaur
they cooked up in that lab.

554
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,082
Wait, what the hell?

555
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,930
It's in the cage.

556
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,260
No, that's impossible. I was just there.

557
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,249
Claire, I'm telling you,
she's in the cage.

558
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,403
Wait a sec.

559
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,860
There are people in there.

560
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,780
Get them out of there now.

561
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,860
Now!

562
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,089
Paddock 11, this is Control.
You need to evacuate the containment area.

563
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,491
Paddock 11.

564
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,169
Paddock 11, do you copy?

565
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,681
Yeah, what's the problem?

566
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,444
It's in the cage!
It's in there with you!

567
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,482
Go!

568
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,171
Close the door.

569
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,380
- We can't lock him in there with that thing.
- Close it now!

570
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,561
Somebody talk to me!

571
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,761
What is happening?

572
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,168
Shit!

573
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,482
Everyone remain calm.

574
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,407
The implant will shock it if it gets
too close to a perimeter fence.

575
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,060
Okay. It's moving really fast.

576
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,980
This is Control.
Put out a park-wide alert.

577
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,100
Hang up that damn phone, please.

578
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,420
Sorry, I'm getting new information.
Everything's fine.

579
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,000
Let Asset Containment
capture it quietly.

580
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:10,420
The very existence of this park
is predicated on our ability

581
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,329
to handle incidents like this.

582
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,220
It was an eventuality, okay?

583
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,060
You should put that in the brochure.

584
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,580
"Eventually, one of these things
will eat somebody."

585
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,048
That paddock is four miles
from the closest attraction.

586
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,641
ACU can handle this.
No one else is gonna get...

587
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,205
Eaten?

588
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:36,331
To all units. This is
a non-lethal operation. Understood?

589
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,850
How fast can they run?

590
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,681
Forty.

591
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,540
Fifty when they're hungry.

592
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,641
Ooh!

593
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,080
You ever open them up,
see what they can do?

594
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,170
No.

595
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,860
Oh, shit!

596
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,440
That got me. It got me.

597
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:02,086
What do you think?
Want to take one home?

598
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,486
Hey, don't joke.

599
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,485
When I was your age,

600
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,882
I rescued a wolf pup.

601
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,880
It was, like, two months old.
It could barely walk.

602
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,723
It used to sleep by my bed.

603
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,086
Watch over me.

604
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,962
My wife, she came at me with a steak knife.

605
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,525
It took a chunk out of her arm.

606
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,127
Did you put him down?

607
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,965
Hell, no.

608
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,811
We had an unshakeable bond, you know?

609
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,843
Just like you and...

610
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,606
What's his name?

611
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,960
Delta. And she's a girl.

612
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,041
Can I...

613
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,323
Oh, wow.

614
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,921
Code 19!

615
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,340
That's the new one!

616
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,566
They said we lost two guys!

617
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,900
What's a Code 19?

618
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,860
- That's Indominus!
- Asset out of containment.

619
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,088
These people, they never learn.

620
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,966
They're gonna learn all kinds of things
about their new asset now.

621
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:25,242
Hey. Yeah, it's me.
We might have an opportunity here.

622
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,404
You guys been here before?

623
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,162
If Mom and Dad get divorced, will one
of us be with Mom and the other with Dad?

624
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,687
What? Why would you say that?

625
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,860
Because they are.

626
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,930
No, they're not getting...
They're not getting divorced.

627
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,651
Look. You haven't been around long enough.
They've always been that way.

628
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,164
They get mail from
two different lawyers.

629
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,980
That doesn't mean anything.

630
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,923
I googled. They're divorce lawyers.

631
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,881
All right, whatever.

632
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,420
You know what? It doesn't matter, okay?

633
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,851
I'm gonna be gone in two years anyway.

634
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,884
I mean, all my friends'
parents are divorced.

635
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,770
Hey, knock it off.

636
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,086
You're gonna cry?

637
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,882
Look. You're gonna get
two of everything, right?

638
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,860
You're gonna get two birthdays,
two Thanksgivings, two...

639
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,883
I don't want two of everything.

640
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,449
Yeah, well, it's not up to you.

641
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,368
All right? There's a point
you have to grow up.

642
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,244
I need to see a badge.
Sir, I need to see a badge.

643
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,930
- What the hell happened out there?
- Sir.

644
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,486
There are thermal cameras
all over that paddock.

645
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,568
She did not just disappear!

646
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,566
It must have been some kind
of a technical malfunction.

647
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,140
Were you not watching?

648
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,980
She marked up that
wall as a distraction.

649
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,620
She wanted us to think she escaped!

650
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,609
Hold on. We are talking
about an animal here.

651
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,820
A highly intelligent animal.

652
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,570
400 meters to the beacon.

653
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,100
You're going after her with non-lethals.

654
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,886
We have $26 million invested
in that asset. We can't just kill it.

655
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,724
Those men are gonna die.

656
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:06,966
300 meters to the beacon.

657
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,281
You need to call
this mission off right now.

658
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,220
They're right on top of it.

659
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,446
Call it off right now.

660
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,563
You are not in control here!

661
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,130
Blood's not clotted yet.

662
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,850
It's close.

663
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,205
What is that?

664
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,331
That's her tracking implant.
She clawed it out.

665
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,323
How would it know to do that?

666
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,848
She remembered where they put it in.

667
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,645
It can camouflage!

668
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:32,885
Evacuate the island.

669
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,020
We'd never reopen.

670
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:40,580
You made a genetic hybrid,
raised it in captivity.

671
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,380
She is seeing all of
this for the first time.

672
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:46,051
She does not even know what she is.

673
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,820
She will kill everything that moves.

674
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:51,780
Do you think the animal
is contemplating its own existence?

675
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,484
She is learning where she fits
in the food chain,

676
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,728
and I'm not sure you want her
to figure that out.

677
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:59,940
Now, Asset Containment can use live
ammunition in an emergency situation.

678
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,900
You have an M134 in your armory.

679
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,900
Put it on a chopper
and smoke this thing!

680
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,180
We have families here.

681
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,567
I'm not gonna turn this place
into some kind of a war zone.

682
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:08,860
You already have.

683
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,123
Mr. Grady, if you're not gonna help,
there's no reason for you to be in here.

684
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:22,380
I would have a word
with your people in the lab.

685
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:26,201
That thing out there,
that's no dinosaur.

686
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,527
Okay.

687
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,523
I'm going to close everything
north of the resort.

688
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,042
This is a Phase One, real world.
Bring everyone in.

689
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,003
This is a Phase One, real world.

690
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,500
I repeat, this is a Phase One.

691
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,125
Bring everyone back in.

692
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,700
Did you know the soft tissue is preserved
because the iron in the dinosaur's blood

693
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,690
generates free radicals,
and those are highly reactive.

694
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,531
So, the proteins and the cell membranes
get all mixed up,

695
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,251
and act as a natural preservative.

696
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,528
DNA can survive for millennia that way.

697
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:17,365
See, now, even if the amber mines dry up,
they'll still have bones...

698
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,084
Shut up.

699
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,260
What do you think's gonna happen
from you just staring at them?

700
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,340
Thanks, man.

701
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,566
You're welcome.

702
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,046
Enjoy the ride.

703
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,500
Pregnant women and those
who suffer from motion sickness

704
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,887
should consult with a doctor
before riding this ride.

705
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,050
Enjoy the ride.

706
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,047
Hello?

707
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,729
Seriously?

708
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,765
Sorry, folks. The ride is closed.

709
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:13,209
Everyone needs to proceed
to the monorail and exit towards the...

710
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,844
Come on, guys, I just work here.

711
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:23,409
Due to technical difficulties,
all our exhibits are now closed.

712
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:35,140
You know that I'm not at liberty
to reveal the asset's genetic makeup.

713
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,811
Modified animals are
known to be unpredictable.

714
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,284
It's killed people, Henry.

715
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:42,926
That's unfortunate.

716
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,650
What purpose could we have
for a dinosaur that can camouflage?

717
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:52,242
Cuttlefish genes were added to help her
withstand an accelerated growth rate.

718
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:57,420
Cuttlefish have chromatophores
that allow the skin to change color.

719
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,170
It hid from thermal technology.

720
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,540
Really?

721
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,324
How is that possible?

722
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:10,660
Tree frogs can modulate
their infrared output.

723
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:14,242
We used strands from their DNA
to adapt her to a tropical climate.

724
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,260
But I never imagined...

725
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:17,521
Who authorized you to do this?

726
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:19,881
You did.

727
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,291
"Bigger."

728
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,283
"Scarier." Um...

729
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,610
"Cooler" I believe is the word
that you used in your memo.

730
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,728
You cannot have an animal
with exaggerated predator features

731
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,127
without the corresponding
behavioral traits.

732
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,402
What you're doing here...

733
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,208
What you have done...

734
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:42,580
The Board will shut down this park,

735
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:45,251
seize your work,
everything you've built.

736
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,681
And Hammond won't be there
to protect you this time.

737
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,088
All of this exists because of me.

738
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:56,408
If I don't innovate, somebody else will.

739
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:00,847
You are to cease
all activities here immediately.

740
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:05,082
You are acting like we are engaged
in some kind of mad science.

741
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:09,860
But we are doing what we have done
from the beginning.

742
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,566
Nothing in Jurassic World is natural.

743
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,645
We have always filled gaps in the genome
with the DNA of other animals.

744
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:20,964
And, if their genetic code was pure,
many of them would look quite different.

745
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:23,885
But you didn't ask for reality.
You asked for more teeth.

746
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,001
I never asked for a monster!

747
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,540
"Monster" is a relative term.

748
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,768
To a canary, a cat is a monster.

749
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,561
We're just used to being the cat.

750
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:38,580
Hey, there. I'm Jimmy Fallon.

751
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,300
Welcome aboard the Gyrosphere,

752
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,971
an amazing machine
made possible by science.

753
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,570
Your safety is our main concern.

754
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,660
Which is why you're behind
our invisible barrier system,

755
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:49,604
which protects you from things
like Dilophosaurus venom.

756
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:54,289
One drop of this can paralyze you,
so watch out.

757
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,971
Is this real? It is?

758
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:02,164
And for added protection, each vehicle is
surrounded by aluminum oxynitride glass.

759
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:05,244
So tough, it can stop
a .50-caliber bullet.

760
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:11,809
The Gyroscopic technology
will keep you upright at all times...

761
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,287
- Where are they?
- ...so you've got nothing to worry about.

762
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,686
Oh, man.

763
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:55,326
Due to technical difficulties
all our exhibits are now closed.

764
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:58,245
Please disembark all rides
and return to the resort.

765
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:04,251
Come on, we can stay out
a couple more minutes.

766
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,660
But they said it was closed.

767
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:08,888
Aunt Claire gave us
special wristbands, right?

768
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,128
We're VIP, dude.

769
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:14,120
Come on. It'll be fun.

770
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,648
- Hello?
- Zara.

771
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,087
I need you to bring the boys back
to the hotel right away.

772
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,123
I don't know... I've been looking
everywhere for them.

773
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,140
- It's just been quite a while.
- Slow down. I can't hear you.

774
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:54,730
Zach and Gray, they've run off.

775
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,046
They what?

776
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,565
Hey, Claire.

777
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,580
Zach, thank God. Is Gray with you?

778
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:08,968
I can't really hear you.
We're in the hamster ball.

779
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,889
Okay. Zach, listen to me.

780
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,849
I need you to...

781
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:15,201
Hello?

782
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,606
Zach?

783
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:19,801
Hmm.

784
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:23,129
Are there any Gyrospheres
left in the Valley?

785
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,685
No, they're all accounted for.
It's my job.

786
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:28,420
What? There's one in the field.

787
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,180
Send a team of rangers, bring them in.

788
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:32,180
Security, we need a search
and rescue in the Valley.

789
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:35,220
It's gonna be a while.
We've got our hands full out here.

790
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,300
No, there are two guests missing!

791
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,368
You need to make this your top priority!

792
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,641
Just do it, man.

793
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,620
There's a lot of guests missing.
We're doing the best we can.

794
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,370
Okay. Fine. I'll do it myself.

795
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,324
Do you think I'm the one you need
to be worried about right now?

796
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,771
Back off!

797
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,606
What happened here?

798
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,329
Dude.

799
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,885
Off-road.

800
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,809
But they told us to go back.

801
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:11,486
I'm just worried you're not getting
the full Jurassic World experience.

802
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,326
Claire!

803
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,007
- I need you. I need your help.
- Okay.

804
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,980
My nephews, they're out in the Valley.

805
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,366
Please, if anything happens to them...

806
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:39,131
How old?

807
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:44,380
The older one, he's high school age.
The younger one, he's...

808
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:45,900
He's a few years...

809
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,240
You don't know how old your nephews are?

810
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,380
No, no. Bad idea, bad idea.

811
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:52,460
Great idea.

812
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,369
No! We're gonna get arrested.

813
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,404
They'll shave our heads, and we're gonna
have to make root beer in the toilet.

814
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,885
What are you talking about?

815
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,407
There.

816
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,700
You see? I told you.

817
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:11,460
You're welcome. Up close
and personal with four dinosauruses.

818
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,210
Ankylosaurus.

819
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:16,722
We shouldn't be here.
And there's five dinosaurs.

820
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,420
Aren't you supposed to be
a genius or something?

821
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,601
Look.

822
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:24,020
One, two, three, four.

823
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:25,485
Five.

824
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:38,820
- Go, go, go!
- Shit!

825
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,006
Hold it together, man!

826
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:59,005
Drive! Drive! Go!

827
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,127
We're safe in here, right?

828
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,924
Yeah. They're totally safe.

829
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,860
Come on.

830
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,645
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

831
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:50,761
Zach.

832
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,380
I almost got it.

833
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,561
- Zach?
- Yeah?

834
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:56,160
- Look.
- What?

835
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:52,321
Go! Go!

836
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,170
Gray, go!

837
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:05,841
Oh, crap!

838
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:15,766
- We're gonna have to jump.
- I can't.

839
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:18,460
Are you ready? One, two... Come on!

840
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,250
You jumped.

841
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:32,930
Stay in the car.

842
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:04,721
Hi.

843
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:06,806
Hi.

844
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,241
I know, I know.

845
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,730
It's all right.

846
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:35,845
All right, girl.

847
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:53,121
Okay.

848
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:54,730
Okay, okay.

849
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,406
You're okay.

850
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:52,969
It didn't eat them.

851
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:55,930
It's killing for sport.

852
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,249
Units on standby, ready for go.

853
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,260
Good. Hold off on that live feed.

854
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:09,169
We've got an evolving situation here.

855
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,248
Did they give you the green light yet?

856
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:12,646
They will.

857
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:21,686
Owen, we have a situation here.

858
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:30,160
Hey, there. I'm Jimmy Fallon.

859
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:32,010
Welcome aboard the Gyrosphere,

860
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:34,487
an amazing machine
made possible by science.

861
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:37,340
Hey, there. Your safety
is our main concern.

862
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,602
Now just relax and enjoy the ride.

863
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:02,807
No, no, no.

864
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,764
Hey.

865
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:09,723
They made it out.

866
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:24,049
Oh, my God, they jumped.

867
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:25,481
Brave kids.

868
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:28,126
Zach! Gray!

869
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:31,164
Hey, I am not one of your damn animals.

870
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:33,900
Listen, those kids are still alive,

871
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,403
but you and I will not be
if you continue to scream like that.

872
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:40,127
So...

873
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:44,740
You can pick up their scent, can't you?
Track their footprints?

874
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,540
I was with the Navy, not the Navajo.

875
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:48,620
So then what should we do?
What do you suggest we do?

876
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,688
You get back. I'll find them.

877
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:53,081
No, we'll find them.

878
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,460
You'll last two minutes in there.

879
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:56,164
Less, in those ridiculous shoes.

880
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:12,764
What is that supposed to mean?

881
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:15,851
It means I'm ready to go.

882
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,047
Okay.

883
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,060
Let's get one thing straight.
I'm in charge out here.

884
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:22,969
You do everything I say,
exactly as I say it.

885
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:24,844
- Excuse me?
- Just relax.

886
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:29,680
It's just like taking a stroll
through the woods.

887
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:33,525
65 million years ago.

888
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,211
Stay here.

889
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:02,051
Wow.

890
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:38,970
You still have those matches?

891
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:43,084
Here you go.

892
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:08,446
Gray!

893
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:42,367
1992 Jeep Wrangler Sahara, Sand Beige.

894
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:47,840
You remember when we fixed up
Grandpa's old Malibu, right?

895
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:50,444
Yeah.

896
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:01,300
Every time this thing kills,
it moves further south.

897
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:02,970
It's headed right for the park.

898
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:04,180
Why would she come here?

899
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:06,020
She can sense thermal radiation.

900
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:09,641
Our emergency measures just put
all the warm bodies in one place.

901
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:12,526
- Sir...
- InGen.

902
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:15,486
Hoskins.

903
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:17,966
I know who you are.

904
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:20,168
Then you know why I'm here.

905
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:24,166
I've been working for two years
on an application for those Raptors.

906
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:28,848
They can hunt and kill that creature.

907
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:31,247
But your program was to test
their intelligence.

908
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:32,970
Yeah, it was. And we did.

909
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:36,409
And in the process,
we learned something.

910
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:39,006
They follow orders.

911
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:42,844
You see, the solution to your crisis
is standing right in front of you.

912
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:46,321
Let me be as clear as I can.

913
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:50,841
No Velociraptors are going to be
set loose on this island.

914
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:52,087
Oh, shit.

915
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:54,340
You're out of your mind!

916
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:55,580
What are you going to do
with all these people?

917
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:57,523
You got 20,000 people here.
What are you going to do?

918
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:59,842
They have no place to go.

919
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:02,042
That thing is a killing machine!

920
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,848
And it will not stop.

921
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,686
Okay.

922
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,620
I intend to personally
look into your project

923
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:16,601
to determine its viability within
the moral principles of this company.

924
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:20,890
Okay, boss.

925
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,410
What's your next move?

926
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:35,448
Sir, I can't get a hold
of your instructor.

927
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:38,729
Never mind. He's likely
caught up in the evacuation.

928
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:41,207
You're sure there's nobody else
who can fly a helicopter?

929
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,327
We don't need anyone else.

930
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,964
You think it's out there?

931
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:19,608
I mean, I know for a fact
it is definitely not out there, all right?

932
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:21,171
We're totally safe.

933
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:24,246
Here, go take this.

934
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,603
You're stronger than me.

935
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:40,206
All right. Turn it over.

936
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:44,965
- Whoo!
- It works!

937
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,968
I thought you failed your driver's test.

938
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:55,889
No, only the driving part.

939
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:15,700
This one of theirs?

940
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:16,847
Yeah.

941
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:20,647
That road goes
straight back to the park.

942
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:25,001
How did they even get
one of these things started?

943
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:10,980
Lowery, we found her.

944
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:14,444
South of the Gyrosphere Valley,
between the old park and the Aviary.

945
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:17,251
- Wait, are you following the dinosaur?
- Yes.

946
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:20,051
Get ACU out here. Real guns this time.

947
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:21,650
ACU is airborne.

948
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:23,780
They took the helicopter.

949
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:25,405
Who's flying it?

950
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:30,121
Did you boys serve in the Armed Forces?

951
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:32,163
Afghanistan, sir.

952
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:35,768
Did your general ever fly
into battle with you?

953
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:37,801
Oh...

954
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:41,284
Got it! Got it.

955
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:45,366
We have eyes on the target,
south of the Aviary.

956
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:46,686
Proceed and engage.

957
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:48,968
Come on! Look alive, boys!

958
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:51,165
Look alive!

959
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,685
10 o'clock! By the birdcage!

960
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:24,420
No, no, no!

961
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:26,966
Looks like the fox got in the henhouse.

962
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:46,409
Pull up! Pull up! Up, up, up!

963
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:23,040
We have a breach in the Aviary.

964
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:45,766
Trees, the trees! Go! Go!

965
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:12,300
Okay, that's it.

966
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:13,925
We're safe now.

967
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:24,526
Go, go!

968
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,210
- Go!
- Oh, shit!

969
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:28,801
Hurry up!

970
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:32,740
Hey!

971
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:33,820
Help!

972
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,251
Open the gate! Let us in!

973
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,020
Open it up!

974
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:38,660
- Come on!
- Come on!

975
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,444
That's a first.

976
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:42,420
- Open the gate!
- Open the gate!

977
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:43,760
Let us in!

978
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:56,420
Attention Aviary employees,
there has been a containment breach.

979
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:57,521
Hello?

980
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:00,020
Claire, we spotted
the boys on surveillance.

981
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:01,121
They're approaching the west gate.

982
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:02,220
I'm headed there now.

983
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:07,167
Okay. Stay right there.
I'm on my way. Stay right with them.

984
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:08,845
Hey!

985
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,291
Get on!

986
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:27,243
Ladies and gentlemen,
due to a containment anomaly

987
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:29,528
all guests must take
shelter immediately.

988
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:34,406
Ladies and gentlemen,
due to a containment anomaly

989
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:36,921
all guests must take
shelter immediately.

990
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:42,371
Ladies and gentlemen,
due to a containment anomaly

991
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:45,370
all guests must take
shelter immediately.

992
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:41,243
All units, take position on boardwalk.

993
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:44,609
Use liquid tranquilizers.
Do not fire live ammunition.

994
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:45,847
Claire, come on!

995
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:07,685
Stop running!

996
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,047
- Wait.
- Ah!

997
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:22,686
Don't just stand there!

998
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:04,844
Go! Get inside now!

999
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,001
Zach!

1000
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:25,046
Gray!

1001
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:31,340
- Aunt Claire!
- Go, go!

1002
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:32,805
Claire!

1003
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:35,845
No! Hold your...

1004
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:03,204
Is that Aunt Claire?

1005
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:25,683
It's them! Zach!

1006
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,120
Gray!

1007
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:30,811
Oh, my God! Thank God! Thank God!
What happened? What is this?

1008
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:32,140
Are you okay?

1009
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:35,961
Where did you go?
Why didn't you come back?

1010
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:38,487
- I was so worried about you.
- Who's that?

1011
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:45,761
We work together.

1012
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:48,081
Hey.

1013
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:50,340
- We gotta go.
- Okay.

1014
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:51,771
Come on, come on.

1015
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:56,369
Hey! You guys can't
just be walking up in...

1016
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:59,805
Simon Masrani's death was a tragedy.

1017
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:04,780
The new mission is to prevent
further loss of life.

1018
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:06,245
Who are these guys?

1019
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:07,811
I'm glad you asked.

1020
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:10,051
You're all relieved of duty.

1021
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:13,082
There's a new team on the ground.

1022
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:33,700
Lowery, I'm on my way back to you.

1023
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:34,926
That's a bad idea.

1024
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:38,889
The board assigned emergency ops to
iNGen's private security division.

1025
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,020
This guy Hoskins is in charge.

1026
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:44,620
And he has this insane plan to use
the Raptors to hunt the Indominus.

1027
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:46,688
What do you mean "use the Raptors"?

1028
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:48,848
Son of a bitch!

1029
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:51,540
You shouldn't say "bitch."

1030
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:54,928
Take the kids. Get them someplace safe.

1031
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:13,020
- You got this!
- Go faster!

1032
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:13,928
Damn it, drive!

1033
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:22,060
This does not feel safe.

1034
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:23,420
Can we stay with you?

1035
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:25,522
I am never leaving you
as long as you live.

1036
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:26,801
No, him.

1037
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:30,645
Yeah, definitely him.

1038
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:00,250
Hey! Right here.

1039
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:02,860
Right here.

1040
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:04,883
She looks at what she wants.

1041
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:08,523
Usually what she wants to eat.

1042
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:29,683
The mother hen has finally arrived.

1043
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:31,441
Oh!

1044
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:36,401
Get the hell out of here
and stay away from my animals.

1045
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:40,243
Hoskins, you wanted this to happen,
you son of a bitch!

1046
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:41,890
Oh, Jesus!

1047
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:46,168
How many more people have to die before
this mission starts to make sense to you?

1048
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:49,124
It's not a mission. It's a field test.

1049
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:52,660
This is an iNGen situation now.

1050
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:56,660
Okay, there are gonna be cruise ships
that show up here at first light.

1051
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:58,171
Everybody's gonna get off this island.

1052
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:02,300
You're gonna watch a news story tomorrow
about how you all saved lives.

1053
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:06,246
No, better yet,
how your animals saved lives.

1054
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:11,689
They've never been
out of containment. It's crazy.

1055
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:13,484
Let's move it out!

1056
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:15,923
This is happening!

1057
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:18,924
With or without you.

1058
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:24,927
We know that she is in sector five.

1059
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:27,726
This is a game we call hide-and-seek.
It's a scent drill.

1060
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:30,620
We've done it about
a thousand times with these animals.

1061
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:34,167
When they get on target,
and they will get on target,

1062
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:36,300
wait to engage.

1063
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,900
Velociraptors are pack hunters.

1064
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,620
They like to herd
the animal into a kill zone.

1065
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:42,960
That's when we take our shot.

1066
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:46,570
Get a clear shot, wait on my command,
and give her everything you got.

1067
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:50,810
We got one good target, gentlemen.
Do not shoot my Raptors.

1068
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:53,201
Please.

1069
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:55,563
Easy, Blue.

1070
01:27:56,680 --> 01:27:58,125
Easy.

1071
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:00,720
Attagirl.

1072
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:05,329
You don't scare me.

1073
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:06,686
Owen.

1074
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:11,967
Are they safe?

1075
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:14,921
No, they're not.

1076
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:17,740
What are their names?

1077
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:19,251
Well, you got Charlie.

1078
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:22,048
There's Echo. Here is Delta.

1079
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:25,730
This one's called Blue. She's the beta.

1080
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:27,721
Who's the alpha?

1081
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:29,450
You're looking at him, kid.

1082
01:28:35,080 --> 01:28:36,340
See?

1083
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:37,885
Totally safe.

1084
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:40,882
All right, get in. Come on.

1085
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:42,320
Get in there.

1086
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:47,540
If you need me, I'll be right up front.

1087
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:48,971
Just open that window.

1088
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,001
Okay?

1089
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:52,806
Put your seatbelts on.

1090
01:28:57,080 --> 01:28:59,048
Okay, so just...

1091
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:01,531
Hold hands.

1092
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:20,281
Um...

1093
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:23,127
Nothing's getting in here, right?

1094
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:27,367
Hey.

1095
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:31,540
Do you remember that
ghost at the old house?

1096
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:33,449
Remember, the one in the garage?

1097
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:37,329
I protected you, right?

1098
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:42,644
You made a battle axe
out of a ruler and a paper plate.

1099
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:44,940
Yeah.

1100
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:47,884
See, nothing is gonna get you
while I'm around, okay?

1101
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:51,201
But you're not always gonna be around.

1102
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:53,885
Yeah, well...

1103
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:55,971
Hey...

1104
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:59,167
We're brothers, okay?

1105
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:03,001
We'll always be brothers, and we'll
always come back to one another.

1106
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:06,521
No matter what.

1107
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:08,881
No matter what?

1108
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:11,011
No matter what.

1109
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:34,850
Awesome.

1110
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:48,980
Here we go.

1111
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:02,403
Your boyfriend's a badass.

1112
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:18,490
Imagine if we had these puppies
in Tora Bora.

1113
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,001
Are you recording this thing?

1114
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:36,131
They're slowing down.

1115
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:38,811
They got something.

1116
01:32:57,560 --> 01:32:58,580
You know what? No, no, no.

1117
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:00,140
You guys are not gonna watch this.

1118
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:01,480
Keep the window closed.

1119
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:39,371
Something's wrong.

1120
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:41,605
They're communicating.

1121
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:52,260
I know why they wouldn't tell us
what it's made of.

1122
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:53,361
Why?

1123
01:33:58,200 --> 01:34:00,328
That thing's part Raptor.

1124
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:09,860
What's taking them so long? Light it up!

1125
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:11,325
Engage!

1126
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:27,405
Oh, my God.

1127
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:40,051
Watch your six.

1128
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:42,570
Raptors got a new alpha.

1129
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:06,401
To the vehicles now!

1130
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:08,602
Fall back!

1131
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:28,210
No!

1132
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:32,088
No! Blue!

1133
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:47,560
Oh, my God.

1134
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:50,248
Is everybody dead?

1135
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:52,140
No, no, no. Everyone is fine.

1136
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:53,500
Don't lie to him.

1137
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:56,001
He's scared. It's okay to lie
when people are scared.

1138
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:58,122
I wanna go home.

1139
01:36:58,240 --> 01:37:00,607
Sweetheart, you will, okay? I promise.

1140
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:02,609
Tomorrow you will be home,

1141
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:05,485
and your mother will
never let me see you again.

1142
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:07,409
Get out of here! Go!

1143
01:37:12,120 --> 01:37:14,020
They're coming!

1144
01:37:24,120 --> 01:37:26,248
Just hold on back there.

1145
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:16,651
- Turn it on.
- I don't know how.

1146
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:25,006
Now!

1147
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:31,820
Are you boys okay?

1148
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:33,540
Did you see that?

1149
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:35,420
I can't wait to tell Mom.

1150
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:38,683
Please, no. Do not tell your mother
about that, ever.

1151
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:43,171
- Owen!
- Owen!

1152
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,970
We gotta get indoors. Follow me.

1153
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:59,409
Lowery, we're headed your way.
Call in a chopper.

1154
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:15,020
Everything must be accounted for.

1155
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:17,282
I want all backup generators online.

1156
01:39:23,480 --> 01:39:24,527
Where have you been?

1157
01:39:24,680 --> 01:39:27,889
Change of plans.
Mission took a jog to the left.

1158
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:29,206
I'm taking everything off-site.

1159
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:30,731
The embryos are safe here.

1160
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:33,140
They can live up to eight weeks
on the generators.

1161
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:36,847
No, no. You listen. The park's
gonna be Chapter 11 by morning.

1162
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:39,681
Okay? Our little side project's
about to get a shot in the arm.

1163
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:40,780
I don't want a bunch of lawyers

1164
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:43,460
messing around with something
that they don't understand.

1165
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:44,721
You get it?

1166
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:46,481
Hey?

1167
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:48,563
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

1168
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:53,722
Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like
to thank you for your patience.

1169
01:39:53,960 --> 01:39:57,442
The next ferry will be leaving
in 45 minutes.

1170
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:00,460
If you require
immediate medical attention,

1171
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:02,900
please report to the nearest
health service station.

1172
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,220
Is this what you had in mind?

1173
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:07,563
Okay, people. We have an extraction
point at the east dock.

1174
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:11,700
Hey.

1175
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:14,121
They said we had to evacuate.
There's a boat.

1176
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:16,209
You coming?

1177
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:25,842
Someone has to stay behind.

1178
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:32,563
Oh, no. I have a boyfriend.

1179
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:36,500
I didn't know that you guys were,
like, together-together.

1180
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:37,681
We are.

1181
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:40,280
That's good.
You don't mention him, ever.

1182
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:41,521
No, I'm at work.

1183
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:43,091
No, no, no. Yeah.

1184
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:46,180
- Well...
- Yeah, okay.

1185
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:47,260
- Great.
- Great.

1186
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:48,340
- Okay.
- Okay.

1187
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:49,680
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

1188
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:52,005
Okay, bye.

1189
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:02,220
Where's Hoskins?

1190
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:04,620
He's sending you and the assets
to a secure location.

1191
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:07,007
But our deal is still intact?

1192
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:10,044
Don't worry.
You'll be well taken care of. Let's go!

1193
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:19,282
Thank you for visiting Jurassic World.

1194
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:21,540
We hope you enjoyed your adventure.

1195
01:41:21,640 --> 01:41:24,291
Don't forget to visit the gift shop,
and remember...

1196
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:27,848
It's always happy
hour at Margaritaville.

1197
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:33,806
Come on, come on. Go inside.

1198
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:42,964
Control room. That way.

1199
01:41:53,200 --> 01:41:55,601
They evacuated the lab.

1200
01:42:36,040 --> 01:42:37,565
What are you doing?

1201
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:41,003
I'm afraid that's above
your pay grade, honey.

1202
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:43,126
Where's Henry?

1203
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:45,923
Dr. Wu, he works for us.

1204
01:42:47,080 --> 01:42:48,730
That's not a real dinosaur.

1205
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:52,280
No, it ain't, kid.

1206
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:56,730
But somebody's gotta make sure
that this company has a future.

1207
01:42:57,440 --> 01:42:58,521
Imagine,

1208
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:02,820
that one, a fraction of the size,

1209
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:05,340
deadly, intelligent,

1210
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:09,286
able to hide from the most
advanced military technology.

1211
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:12,820
A living weapon unlike anything
we've ever seen.

1212
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:13,887
You see...

1213
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:18,050
Millions of years of evolution,
what did we learn?

1214
01:43:20,160 --> 01:43:22,561
Nature is the gift that just...

1215
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:24,131
Oh, shit!

1216
01:43:27,320 --> 01:43:28,606
Easy.

1217
01:43:29,640 --> 01:43:31,529
Easy, boy.

1218
01:43:31,640 --> 01:43:33,881
Easy. Hey, hey.

1219
01:43:36,120 --> 01:43:39,966
We're on the same side, right? Right?

1220
01:43:41,640 --> 01:43:44,484
Easy.

1221
01:43:46,120 --> 01:43:47,770
I'm on your side.

1222
01:43:56,840 --> 01:43:58,220
No, boys. Boys, this way. Come on.

1223
01:43:58,320 --> 01:43:59,651
Come on. Come on.

1224
01:44:35,640 --> 01:44:37,051
That's how it is?

1225
01:44:53,200 --> 01:44:55,362
Easy. Easy.

1226
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:00,721
Easy.

1227
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:12,405
That's it.

1228
01:46:22,200 --> 01:46:23,964
24, 50.

1229
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:26,007
We need more.

1230
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:28,940
More what?

1231
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:30,087
Teeth.

1232
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:31,725
We need more teeth.

1233
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:44,171
Okay, so you just wait here.

1234
01:46:45,560 --> 01:46:46,607
It's gonna be fine.

1235
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:36,770
Lowery, are you still there?

1236
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:38,527
Hey, where are you?

1237
01:47:38,720 --> 01:47:40,563
I need you to open Paddock 9.

1238
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:42,566
Paddock 9?

1239
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:45,248
You kidding?

1240
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:53,580
Damn it, Lowery, be a man
and do something for once in your life.

1241
01:47:53,680 --> 01:47:55,808
Why do you have to make it personal?

1242
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:11,811
Run!

1243
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:14,125
Go! Go, go!

1244
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:45,210
Oh, my God, it's your parents.
It's your parents.

1245
01:53:47,080 --> 01:53:48,286
Come on, come on.

1246
01:53:52,240 --> 01:53:54,720
Are you okay? Oh, baby.

1247
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:05,603
I'm so sorry.

1248
01:54:07,560 --> 01:54:09,085
Are you okay?

1249
01:54:13,440 --> 01:54:14,680
Come here.

1250
01:54:16,360 --> 01:54:17,885
Sweetie.

1251
01:54:35,160 --> 01:54:36,685
So, what do we do now?

1252
01:54:38,280 --> 01:54:40,169
Probably stick together.

1253
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:43,525
For survival.

1254
01:54:44,305 --> 01:55:44,418
