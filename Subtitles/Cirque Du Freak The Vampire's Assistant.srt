00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:55,930
You know, sometimes it seems
like life is all planned out.

3
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,057
There's no choice
in the matter.

4
00:00:58,142 --> 00:01:01,811
We're all gonna end up in the same
place, whether we like it or not.

5
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,480
But sometimes things
aren't so simple.

6
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:07,900
You can end up hurting the
people you love the most,

7
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,903
betraying the people you
want to come through for.

8
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:16,117
That's not me.
That's my best friend, Steve.

9
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,744
We've been best friends
since third grade,

10
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:22,331
when he punched this kid, Billy Utsch,
for slamming a locker door on my head.

11
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,295
That's me. I"m Darren
Shan, and this is my story.

12
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:31,257
Oh, and, trust me, spending
this much time in a coffin

13
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,593
was never part of my plan.

14
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:35,011
Guess l'm just lucky.

15
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:27,183
Up until recently,
my life was pretty good.

16
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,520
l was popular enough.

17
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:35,149
l got good grades, 'cause
my allowance was tied to it.

18
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,235
A's! l love you.
l love you.

19
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,988
Yeah, that's the boy.
That's the boy.

20
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:42,657
Hey, you.
What's up, D?

21
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,659
And l had
some cool friends.

22
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,410
Hey, what's up?

23
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,663
Uh,
not including that dude.

24
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:53,167
I mean, we were friends in fifth
grade, but he'd become kind of a freak.

25
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,503
See, that used to
matter to me.

26
00:04:56,171 --> 00:05:00,800
There was one thing in my life
that was a bit insane, one friend.

27
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,551
Hey.
My best friend.

28
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,553
Let's cut, all right?
What?

29
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,597
No, we're here.
Class is starting, man.

30
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:08,265
All right, folks.

31
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,644
What you got for me?

32
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,438
Okay, listen, l cannot
deal with that jerk today.

33
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:19,777
All right, Mr. Perfect, come on,
take a risk. Take a risk. Come on!

34
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,454
So, hey, l'm thinking about
moving to Mexico. You want to go?

35
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:31,872
Yeah, sure. Why not?

36
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:34,083
Yeah, you're not going
anywhere, Mr. Perfect.

37
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,919
Oh, shit.

38
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:41,424
Hey, man, l bet you can't hit that
light from all the way back here.

39
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,635
What? No, we're
gonna get busted.

40
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,554
"Steve, we're gonna
get busted."

41
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,101
Hey!
Rock. Come on.

42
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:58,107
And so the Mutually Assured
Destruction policy of the Cold War

43
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:01,444
was just that. Mad.

44
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:06,449
What the heck is that?

45
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:11,454
l'm so sorry.

46
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:14,582
lt's that Steve.
lt's that damn Steve.

47
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:15,833
Uh...

48
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,586
Did Darren tell you he got
an A on his math test?

49
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,213
Yes, he did, honey.
Go to your room.

50
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:24,133
You are not going to be
friends with that Steve anymore!

51
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,885
Mom, l'm not
five years old.

52
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:28,179
You can't tell me who l can
and can't be friends with.

53
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:30,181
You are on
a good path, Darren,

54
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:32,725
and that Steve is knocking
you right off that path.

55
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:33,976
What path?

56
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:37,438
The path to a happy,
productive life.

57
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:42,443
To a good college, a great
job and a family of your own.

58
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:47,364
A happy, productive life.
College, job, family!

59
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,241
College, job,
family!

60
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,577
And one day, if you're really lucky,

61
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,413
you'll be standing here yelling
at a teenager of your own!

62
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:56,749
College, job,
family!

63
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:00,002
College, job, family!

64
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:04,673
College, job, family!
lt's not that hard!

65
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,592
Darren,
are you listening?

66
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:08,761
So, wait. You...

67
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:12,431
What, you told your parents you're
not gonna be friends with me anymore?

68
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:15,392
Yeah, but, l mean,
it doesn't mean anything.

69
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,812
We're still like
best friends.

70
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:20,523
Okay, like what,
secret best friends?

71
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,318
Yeah, kind of.

72
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:26,946
l mean, no, it's like...

73
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,781
Look, l don't care
what they say.

74
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,199
Bullshit.

75
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:33,119
You do care what they say.
You do whatever they say.

76
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,620
That's just who you are.

77
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,623
You never stand up for
yourself or anybody else.

78
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,209
Maybe your parents
are right.

79
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:43,129
Maybe you shouldn't be friends
with me. l'm nothing. l'm garbage.

80
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,089
You're not garbage.

81
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:48,259
You're my friend.
You're my best friend.

82
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:19,915
Whoa!

83
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,836
"Cirque du Freak. One night only.
The world's greatest freak show.

84
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,588
"Five hundred years."
What the heck?

85
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,047
Dude, that
looks awesome.

86
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:30,551
l can't go, though.
l'm grounded for two months.

87
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,721
Right. And we're also
not friends anymore.

88
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:38,893
What's this?

89
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,771
A freak show?
This is illegal.

90
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,941
l hope you weren't thinking
of attending this.

91
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:51,363
Because the idea of taking
a group of disgusting,

92
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:57,161
weird, deformed people and exploiting
them for money... Not in our town.

93
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:02,374
l'm assuming no one in this
class would actually go to this.

94
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:35,157
Hey. You know that means something
when the moon looks like that.

95
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:36,909
l read about it...

96
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,786
ln one of your
vampire books?

97
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,746
l should explain.

98
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,791
Steve was obsessed
with vampires,

99
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:47,336
and I, on the other hand,
was obsessed with spiders.

100
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:51,715
l don't know why. lt was just like
it was in our blood or something.

101
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,720
"Back in three seconds"?

102
00:09:57,681 --> 00:10:00,849
One, two, three.
lt's been three seconds.

103
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:06,272
Uh...

104
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:08,565
Okay.

105
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,985
l guess they want money.

106
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:17,074
Hey, l need two
tickets, please.

107
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,079
Hey! Hey!

108
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,749
Hey, come on. l gave you the
money, give me the ticket.

109
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,293
Ow! Whoa!

110
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:30,587
Holy crap!
God, what was that?

111
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,134
Hey, come on!

112
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:37,970
And it's gone.

113
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,556
You okay?
Yeah.

114
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:46,562
Hello?

115
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:55,738
Are you boys 21?

116
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,450
Are you 21?

117
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,910
Say yes.

118
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:05,831
Yeah.
Yeah.

119
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:09,918
Good. You don't have
a tendency towards panic,

120
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:15,591
sudden cardiac arrest or
crippling anxiety, do you?

121
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,385
Say no.

122
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:21,805
No.
No.

123
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,726
All right, then.

124
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:33,067
Go ahead in.
Show is about to start.

125
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:55,839
Welcome.

126
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:58,384
Welcome to the
Cirque du Freak,

127
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:03,347
the oldest continuously operating
freak show in the Western hemisphere.

128
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,265
We have toured
for 500 years,

129
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:09,311
bringing the bizarre to
generation after generation.

130
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:13,148
May l present the Wolfman!

131
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:25,828
No sudden noises.

132
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:35,629
Dude, he totally just
scratched his balls.

133
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,186
No!

134
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:55,607
Call an ambulance!

135
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,359
lt's okay.
That's not necessary.

136
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:02,865
Good boy.

137
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,492
And stay.

138
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,048
Ladies
and gentlemen,

139
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:24,386
the enchanting recycling
queen, Corma Limbs.

140
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:30,392
And now our resident hunger
artist, Alexander Ribs!

141
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:37,274
Freaky-freak,
freak for freak freak.

142
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:41,153
Oh, look, a candy corn.

143
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:44,907
And next, Gertha Teeth!

144
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,663
And Rhamus Twobellies!

145
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:54,791
l have arrived!

146
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,941
Hey, nice bike!

147
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:23,570
Come on.
That is so rude.

148
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:27,699
And next,
Evra the Snake Boy!

149
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:49,972
Stay, Bippo.

150
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:55,310
So, l'm Evra Von Britow,
and we are Serpentine.

151
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,604
Who's "we"?

152
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:01,650
There'll be some CDs for sale in the
lobby immediately following the show.

153
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,909
Bippo! No!

154
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,161
Bippo, drop it,
spit that out!

155
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,872
Yes, l'm glad you're all enjoying
this so much. lt's awesome.

156
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:18,542
Evra, please
be professional.

157
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,753
lt's not my fault.
l just want to play music.

158
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,255
We'll discuss it later.

159
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,590
But...

160
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,466
And now,

161
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:30,345
the voluptuous,
the exotic,

162
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:35,309
the insightful
Madame Truska!

163
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:47,529
Do we have someone brave
enough to be my assistant?

164
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,197
Over here.
Oh, yeah.

165
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,116
Come on. Come on.

166
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:53,035
You.

167
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:22,022
Who are you?

168
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:28,570
My name is Fred Smith.
l'm from out of town.

169
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:50,926
Larten, finish your act quickly,
and let's leave this town early.

170
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,803
What? l have someone
here tonight.

171
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,180
Ready for more?

172
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,308
Larten Crepsley
and Madam Octa!

173
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:03,063
Don't go on.
l have a foreboding.

174
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:05,190
You always have
a foreboding, beautiful.

175
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,942
Larten!

176
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:14,700
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

177
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:17,160
l am so excited to be here
in anonymous small town

178
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:19,454
which used to have character
but is now just a bland suburb

179
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:22,040
filled with chain stores
and surrounded by slums.

180
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,000
lt really is a pleasure
to be here.

181
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:25,377
And l am so honored that

182
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:29,381
blah, blah, blah and so on and
so forth, et cetera, ad nauseum.

183
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:33,343
l'm afraid l have some
unfortunate news, however.

184
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:37,597
l had hoped to present my usual
act, but my spider, Madam Octa,

185
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:41,184
seems to have escaped from her
cage and is currently missing.

186
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:45,230
Use caution when retrieving your
belongings from beneath your seats.

187
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:48,066
She is very poisonous.

188
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:49,526
But not to worry.

189
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:54,656
Tonight l will perform for you
some startling illusions.

190
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:59,411
First, a rabbit from a hat.

191
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:06,084
This is Madam Octa.

192
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:11,798
lnteresting fact, one bite from
this spider means certain death.

193
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:15,802
But don't worry.
As long as l stay calm...

194
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:17,512
She's beautiful.

195
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:20,849
lf l could just get
my flute, that usually...

196
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:04,267
Darren. His name's
not Larten Crepsley.

197
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:06,394
lt's Vur Horsten.
He's a vampire.

198
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,315
l saw his painting
in one of my vampire books.

199
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,821
lt's him. He's got
the same scars,

200
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,073
the same hair,
the same everything.

201
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:21,618
You seriously think
he's a vampire?

202
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:22,911
Yeah.

203
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,931
May l have my spider
back, please?

204
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:49,604
Now, boys,
vampires don't exist,

205
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:53,316
but if one did and he
thought someone knew,

206
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:55,777
he might smother them
in their sleep.

207
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:00,198
That's it! Show's over!

208
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,826
lt's Mr. Kersey.
Come on, let's go.

209
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,621
By order of the Health lnspector,
this theater is shut down!

210
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,498
Good Lord, not again.

211
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:12,627
Welcome to the Cirque.
What seems to be the problem?

212
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:15,171
We don't want you
filthy people here.

213
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:16,506
That's not the problem.

214
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:21,595
The problem is you are exploiting
these poor people for profit.

215
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,099
Thank you. Thank you so
much for looking out for us.

216
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:29,895
So you gonna let us move
in with you? Give us jobs?

217
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:32,188
Freak!

218
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:37,110
So clumsy. l felt like a
manatee. lt felt terrible.

219
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,278
No.

220
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:45,243
Octa.

221
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:53,752
Anyone here?

222
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:57,672
Whoa.

223
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,912
Hey, Octa. l'm Darren.
l'm a big fan.

224
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,138
We can speak in private.
lt's the only...

225
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:53,520
We can talk in private.
The police have left now.

226
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:56,106
So, this is what you've
been doing with your life.

227
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,148
You didn't
like the act.

228
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,274
l'm insane.
l'm insane. l'm insane.

229
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:01,111
Well, l saw the
spider bit coming.

230
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:03,530
Everybody's a critic.

231
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:07,200
lt's not easy to hold an
audience's attention these days.

232
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:11,454
To us and Charna's Guts.
To us and Charna's Guts.

233
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,167
Did you see that
fingernail moon tonight?

234
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:18,420
The first one
in 50 years.

235
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,840
Yes. l noticed it.

236
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:26,261
Look, Vincent's dead.

237
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,639
Murdered. Sucked dry
by one of them.

238
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,353
They're after us, man. They're
after us. They're after us!

239
00:22:35,438 --> 00:22:37,355
Those damn Vampaneze!
They're gonna pick us off.

240
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,524
First Vincent,
then you, then me.

241
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,359
Why me before you?

242
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:44,696
Well, because l'm the toughest,
and they'll save me for last.

243
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,781
Oh. Of course,
l forgot.

244
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:48,825
Well, what about
the Vampire Council?

245
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,618
They must have something
to say about Vincent.

246
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:54,831
Yes. They say good riddance.
They're a bunch of wimps now, Larten.

247
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:57,834
They'll do anything to avoid
a war with the Vampaneze.

248
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:02,630
There are no real generals left, hombre.
You and l were the last of the Mo-Freakins!

249
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:05,300
And to top it off,
Tiny's back.

250
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:09,596
Mr. Tiny?
Back from the other side?

251
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,767
Yes! Just last week he
was at the Council Library,

252
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:16,061
messing with
the Book of Souls.

253
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:17,812
He's trying
to destroy us all!

254
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:20,982
Megalomaniac!
That man's a megalomaniac!

255
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:37,165
And those murderous,
scumbag Vampaneze,

256
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,585
they're up to something, too,
and it's all connected.

257
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,879
lt's all connected.
l can feel it!

258
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:46,341
Come with me.
We can avenge old Vincent.

259
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,592
Kill us some Vampaneze!

260
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,302
No. l'm sorry.

261
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,304
No? Why?

262
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:54,516
l'm done fighting.

263
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,186
l left that life for a reason.
l'm just a vaudevillian.

264
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,480
lt's a simple life,
and l like it.

265
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:03,233
Steve.

266
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:07,487
l know who you are. l know
what you are, Vur Horsten.

267
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:13,451
Who sent you? The Apocalypse
Monger? The Blood Barons?

268
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:15,662
No... No one. l... No
one sent me. l just...

269
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:18,123
l have these vampire books,
and l saw a painting of him

270
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:20,083
with some girl in,
like, 1819.

271
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:23,753
lt said that she broke up with him
when she found he was a vampire.

272
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,297
Did you hear
that, Gavner?

273
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:29,425
Missy broke up with me
because l was a vampire.

274
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,762
Funny, l always thought it was
the only thing she liked about me.

275
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:34,931
Let the kid go.
Let him go.

276
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:39,227
Now, are you
mentally unfit?

277
00:24:39,854 --> 00:24:42,814
Didn't you hear me
threaten you at the show?

278
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,233
l did.
lt was awesome.

279
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:51,573
You see, l want this. l want
you to make me into a vampire.

280
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,827
l mean, vampires, they
don't take crap from anybody.

281
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,662
They live by their
own set of rules.

282
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:00,832
lt's true they do have their
own rules. We wrote some of them.

283
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:05,044
Yes, and one of them is
children can't become vampires.

284
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:06,337
Look, look, blood.

285
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,756
Blood.

286
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:12,343
You see, Gavner,
blood.

287
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,849
Look, if you
become a vampire,

288
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,894
you have to leave your
friends and your family.

289
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:23,771
lt's deeply depressing.
Trust me.

290
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,858
Now get out of here.

291
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,948
l haven't seen
my dad in years.

292
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:38,328
My mom is drunk
all the time.

293
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,789
l absolutely hate my life.

294
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:47,128
l never actually said it
before, but it's the truth.

295
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:52,133
This is what
l was meant for.

296
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,428
What you're
meant for?

297
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,016
Well, if that's the case,
let's test your blood.

298
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:01,309
No. No.

299
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:10,944
Who sent you here?
Your blood tastes of evil.

300
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:16,157
You can never
be a vampire.

301
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,160
What?

302
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:21,329
l have what, bad blood?

303
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:25,041
l'm never gonna
forget this.

304
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:28,920
One day, l promise you,
l will hunt you down.

305
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,296
And what?

306
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:33,675
Kill me?

307
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:38,846
Do you know how easily l could
kill you? l could do it tonight.

308
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:42,767
l could knock you out and
lay you in front of a bus,

309
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,102
and no one
would ever know!

310
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:48,773
Calm down. Save that stuff for
the enemy. He's just an idiot kid,

311
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,567
who should be
leaving right now

312
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,195
while he still can.

313
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,744
You're out there, man.

314
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:05,039
All right.
One for the road.

315
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:09,669
l'm headed back
to the Mountain

316
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:14,257
to try to convince those old cowards
to stand up against the Vampaneze.

317
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:19,095
Gavner, if we kill one
of them, it means war.

318
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,890
Wouldn't that
be a shame?

319
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:28,938
Poor old Vincent.

320
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:33,234
You've been awfully
quiet under there.

321
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:57,800
Get in.

322
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:24,285
Thanks. Thanks,
l really needed a ride.

323
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:27,622
Oh, absolutely,
absolutely delighted.

324
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,503
Are you the one
known as Steve?

325
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:39,425
No, l'm the one
known as Darren.

326
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,844
l actually had a bike.

327
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:45,348
But l'll just get it
tomorrow in the daylight.

328
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:48,976
No need.
lt's in the trunk.

329
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:53,398
Now, if l
may ask, Darren,

330
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:59,654
do you believe in the
immutability of the human soul?

331
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:02,865
The what?

332
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:06,077
So, he knows nothing
of souls, does he?

333
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,622
Knows only
of blood, huh?

334
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:13,876
The pulsing, the
delicious, the ruby red.

335
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:24,971
Wow, wow, you know what? You
can just let me off right here.

336
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:27,098
What's the rush?

337
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:31,894
After all, didn't we save you
from the scary, scary vampire?

338
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:38,776
Doesn't act like
leadership material.

339
00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:42,363
Acts more like a bag
of blood. Are you? Huh?

340
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:43,656
Bag of blood?

341
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,033
Shows how much
you know, Murlaugh.

342
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:48,744
l think he reeks
of potential.

343
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:51,289
Ow!
Sorry.

344
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,041
Souvenir.

345
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:03,301
We all have
a destiny, Darren.

346
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:07,096
And with a few simple tests,
we can find out what yours is.

347
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:11,601
Wonderful to
meet you, Darren.

348
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:15,354
lt's like looking
in a mirror.

349
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:27,492
Darren!

350
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,203
We'll be in touch.

351
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:53,100
Freaky dream.
Freaky. Freaky.

352
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:02,568
Hey. Hey, l'm gonna try
to get you some food, okay?

353
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:06,489
Just hold on one sec. l'm gonna go get
some flies from the window sill, okay?

354
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:09,242
Hey. Why have you
been acting so weird?

355
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:12,703
l'm not acting weird.

356
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:13,746
You were just talking
to your backpack.

357
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,872
What?

358
00:31:14,957 --> 00:31:16,707
No, l wasn't.
Darren, yes, you were.

359
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:18,459
l wasn't. Let me... Just
let me see it a second.

360
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:20,294
You see? lt's just my
backpack. Seriously, stop it.

361
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,672
Hey, give me my backpack,
man. Hey, just let me see it.

362
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:27,218
Holy shit! That's...
That's the...

363
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:30,680
Yeah, l went back to the theater after
the show and l kind of borrowed it.

364
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:33,599
You stole from a vampire? Do
you realize you're a dead man?

365
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:34,934
Shh!
You're a dead man!

366
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,394
He's never gonna find me.

367
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:37,937
Okay, just...

368
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:42,567
Wait a second. When did you
go to Vur Horsten's room,

369
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,485
and what did you see?

370
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:49,574
All right,
l saw everything.

371
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:52,326
Steve, are you crazy? Why would
you want to become a vampire?

372
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:56,289
Listen, you can't understand.
You have everything.

373
00:31:57,165 --> 00:32:00,167
What do l have?
A secret best friend?

374
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:05,965
Hey, leave it
in there, okay?

375
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,425
lt's fine.
l want to see it.

376
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:13,097
Be careful. Hey, be careful,
okay? Be really careful.

377
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:19,604
This thing's even
more hideous close up.

378
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:20,730
Can you just put it
back now, please?

379
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,538
Okay,
l need the pipe.

380
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:41,208
GlRL: l got a B-minus
in history.

381
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,210
No!

382
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,132
Oh, my gosh,
what is that?

383
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:03,022
Move!

384
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:04,231
Steve! Wait!

385
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,400
What's going on?

386
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,540
Move! Get out of
the way, idiots!

387
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:26,837
Watch out! Move!

388
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,632
Hey! Steve, don't!

389
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,512
Now l got you!
Hold still!

390
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:38,933
What's the matter with you?
Whose side are you on?

391
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:47,858
Hey! No! Hey!

392
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:01,080
GlRL: Guys, look,
it's in his shirt!

393
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:06,419
Get it off me!

394
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:07,962
GlRL: Oh, my God!

395
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:51,338
So what have you come to
steal from me this time? Thief!

396
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:53,924
Nothing. Nothing.

397
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:59,013
Look, Octa bit my best friend,
Steve, and he's in the hospital,

398
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:01,223
in a coma,
because of me.

399
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:04,435
And l was wondering
if you had an antidote.

400
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:05,853
l do.

401
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,062
Thank you.

402
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:09,690
But l only have
a couple doses left.

403
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:13,277
Why should l waste any
on some little psychopath?

404
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,488
Please, l'm begging
you, okay?

405
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:18,032
Look, l'm really sorry
l stole Octa.

406
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,660
l don't know what came over
me. l never steal things.

407
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,245
Why not?

408
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:25,247
Because it's wrong.

409
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:27,625
So then you've learned
a valuable moral lesson.

410
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:28,751
Yes, l have.

411
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:32,379
And you'll never do anything
wrong again, as long as you live.

412
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:33,589
No, l won't.

413
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:36,884
You see? Now you're
a thief and a liar.

414
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,595
What did
Mr. Tiny want?

415
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:41,222
Mr. Tiny?

416
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,015
The fat man
in the limousine!

417
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:48,395
l don't know, something about
souls and... And destiny.

418
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,147
And he knew
where l lived.

419
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:53,984
Looks like you're in deep
shit, my larcenous friend.

420
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:57,530
Mr. Tiny doesn't just take
a random interest in people.

421
00:35:57,614 --> 00:36:01,742
And the people he does take an
interest in wind up dead or worse.

422
00:36:05,956 --> 00:36:07,873
What's worse than dead?

423
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,417
Oh.

424
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:12,920
Lots of things.

425
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:21,971
All right. l'll do it.
l'll make you a bargain.

426
00:36:23,265 --> 00:36:26,851
You'll become my assistant. l'll
turn you into a half vampire.

427
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:30,187
You'll be able to go out in the
daylight, very useful for me.

428
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:33,691
You'll do chores for me and
guard my coffin on the road.

429
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:37,486
And in return, l'll try and
keep Mr. Tiny away from you.

430
00:36:37,571 --> 00:36:40,489
Oh, and l'll save
your stupid friend Steve,

431
00:36:40,574 --> 00:36:43,659
despite the fact that
he threatened to kill me.

432
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,748
You'll save Steve?

433
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:50,875
Why not?

434
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:59,133
lf l became a half vampire,
would l have to kill people?

435
00:37:00,302 --> 00:37:01,927
lnterested, huh?

436
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:06,724
Vampires don't kill the people
they feed on. Vampaneze do.

437
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:10,811
Big source of controversy, war
for about 80 years, then a truce,

438
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:14,148
getting ugly again,
apparently. But time's wasting.

439
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,653
Want to become a vampire?

440
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:24,325
lt's a lonely life,
but there's lots of it.

441
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,745
l can't make that
decision right now.

442
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:33,584
Do you wanna go home and
ask your mommy and daddy?

443
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:37,463
Do they make all the decisions
for good little boys like you?

444
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,340
No, they don't.

445
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,678
Poor Steve doesn't
have much time left.

446
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:56,523
Fine, l'll do it. To save my
friend, not for any other reason.

447
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:59,151
So get the antidote.

448
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:00,486
Right here.

449
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,698
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

450
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:05,991
First things first.

451
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:09,078
Let's test your blood.

452
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:13,874
What are you doing? l'm not gonna bite you
in the jugular. l could kill you that way.

453
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:15,709
Show me your hands.

454
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:20,547
Ow!

455
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:22,508
Mmm.

456
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:27,388
You have good blood. This will
work. All right, hold up your hands.

457
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:29,556
We're going
to exchange blood.

458
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:30,808
That's creepy.

459
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:33,310
l know. But that's
how it's done.

460
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:46,657
This may hurt when
it gets to your heart.

461
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,547
l feel cold.

462
00:39:03,425 --> 00:39:05,092
Lick your fingers.

463
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:18,480
Whoa, is that like vampire
power? Do l have super-spit now?

464
00:39:18,565 --> 00:39:22,151
Yes, you have super-spit.
The rest will take a while.

465
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,113
The rest of what?
What will l be able to do?

466
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,865
Can l, like, turn into a bat and stuff?

467
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:29,950
No, that's bullshit.

468
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,620
Now hop on my back.
We're going to flit.

469
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,080
We're gonna what?

470
00:39:35,165 --> 00:39:37,458
Just shut up
and hop on my back.

471
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:51,388
You held your
breath, right?

472
00:39:51,473 --> 00:39:53,682
Did l not tell you
to hold your breath?

473
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,059
Oh...

474
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:56,310
Sorry.

475
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,275
Hold on.

476
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,527
Why didn't we just
take the elevator?

477
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:07,613
l get claustrophobic.

478
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:10,491
Strange, huh, given
where l sleep every night.

479
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:14,328
But somehow when it's my own
confined space, it's different.

480
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:18,957
He looks horrible. Can you
give him the antidote, please?

481
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,714
She really
didn't like him.

482
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,843
Be careful.

483
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,397
Hey, what are you doing?

484
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:47,194
Shh.

485
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,999
That's it, right?
He's gonna be better now?

486
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:02,084
That's it.

487
00:41:10,844 --> 00:41:12,052
You are insufferable.

488
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:13,470
Back! Stay back!

489
00:41:13,555 --> 00:41:14,596
Code blue...

490
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:17,599
You have no idea how
ridiculous you look right now.

491
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:18,809
Code blue...

492
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:22,020
All right. lf you want to pretend
this isn't happening, fine.

493
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:25,399
But being a vampire takes
skill. What is a code blue?

494
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,025
Code bIue, code bIue...

495
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,778
Try not to do something
stupid like kill your family.

496
00:41:29,863 --> 00:41:33,031
Code bIue, code bIue,
room 519, stat.

497
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:35,159
You are not supposed
to be in here!

498
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:38,245
Code blue. All available
staff please report to room...

499
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,670
lt must have hurt.

500
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:47,921
Yeah, it hurt.

501
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,757
lt wasn't...
lt wasn't fun.

502
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:52,009
lt's great
you're back.

503
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:53,177
Yeah.
We missed you.

504
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:56,305
Well, well, well,
Steve is back, huh?

505
00:41:56,389 --> 00:42:00,559
So, Steve, what
you got for me?

506
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:14,364
Stay away from those
brownies. They're for dessert.

507
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,491
Okay.
No brownies.

508
00:42:16,576 --> 00:42:17,618
Next...

509
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:33,550
Hey, Darren, do you think that this
outfit looks better on her, or this?

510
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:38,430
What's going on?

511
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,604
You look weird.
Darren.

512
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:47,898
Darren!

513
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:52,986
Sorry.

514
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:57,115
Sorry, l... l was just
pretending to be a vampire.

515
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:06,667
Nice room.

516
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:10,504
Some excellent reading
material you have here.

517
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,340
Thought this was all
on the lnternet now.

518
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,050
Mine's blocked.

519
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:16,134
Hmm.

520
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:21,348
Don't... No, don't
do that. Don't cry.

521
00:43:22,392 --> 00:43:24,518
Honestly. Stop, stop.
No.

522
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,186
l'm not crying.

523
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:28,105
Of course not.
That's what...

524
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:32,943
Look, l don't want to hurt
people, okay? l'm not like you.

525
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:35,279
l was this close away
from killing my sister.

526
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:39,533
Perhaps you should have thought
of that before you stole my spider!

527
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:44,955
Look, l'm sorry,
but you can't stay here.

528
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,581
You're going to
have to leave them.

529
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:49,918
Like forever?

530
00:43:50,003 --> 00:43:51,378
Like forever.

531
00:43:53,006 --> 00:43:55,924
lt's time to admit that
to yourself, Darren.

532
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,351
But you can't
just leave.

533
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:09,187
You're going to
have to die first.

534
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,282
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

535
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:21,408
Hmm?

536
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:25,996
Hi. Hi.

537
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:32,336
Hey, l just wanted to say that you
guys are really, really good parents.

538
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:36,840
You're doing a great job, and l'm
sorry for not doing all my chores

539
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:39,092
and for complaining
so much.

540
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:43,305
And l love you
guys a lot.

541
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:45,098
We love you,
too, sweetie.

542
00:44:57,362 --> 00:44:58,779
Bye, Annie.

543
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:06,787
How old were you when
you became a vampire?

544
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:11,792
Twenty. lt was 1803,
the third of May.

545
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,171
l'd just been left by my
fiancÃ©e, Hesther Collins.

546
00:45:16,798 --> 00:45:19,925
l thought she was the most
beautiful girl in Baltimore.

547
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:23,553
l saw her again 60 years
later. She was an old crone,

548
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:27,808
but my heart still
beat like a jackrabbit.

549
00:45:30,395 --> 00:45:33,146
Wow, dumped, huh?

550
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:36,608
So big, bad, old Crepsley became
a vampire 'cause he got dumped?

551
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:40,695
Have you ever
been dumped?

552
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:44,366
Yeah.

553
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:47,661
Then perhaps you should
be more sympathetic.

554
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:50,914
Here it is.
Drink up.

555
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:06,430
My lips are numb.

556
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:07,556
Good.

557
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:12,936
l've got pins and
needles in my hands.

558
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,439
Excellent. That means it's working.

559
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,279
Nice night,
actually.

560
00:46:23,865 --> 00:46:26,658
ls that the Little Dipper or the
Big one? l can never remember.

561
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,536
Sorry about that.

562
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:33,039
l had to do that or they would never
believe you were dead. Don't worry.

563
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:35,208
There's no damage
to your spinal cord,

564
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:37,961
and l'll sneak into the funeral
home and fix your broken neck.

565
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:41,715
Oh, and sorry about
this next part.

566
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,317
Darren,

567
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:05,739
l hate you so much for leaving
me here with these idiots.

568
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:21,630
Darren.
Hey, Shan!

569
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,966
Asswipe, are you in
there? Darren! Steve.

570
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:29,095
Okay, time out, time out. Not
about you. We're all feeling grief.

571
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:23,149
Wake-y, wake-y.

572
00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:26,361
Here.
Fill that hole.

573
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:30,282
l can't do that. l'm all cramped
up. My legs are still numb.

574
00:48:30,658 --> 00:48:31,825
Can you feel this?

575
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,660
Ow! What the heck?

576
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:40,709
Do you smell
a rotting corpse?

577
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:42,168
Ha, ha, very funny.

578
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:44,588
Get back in the grave.

579
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:45,964
l'm not getting
back in the grave.

580
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:47,757
Don't argue
with me. Get in.

581
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:48,883
No.

582
00:48:58,019 --> 00:49:02,939
Hello, old friend. Old
Crepsley. How's the scar?

583
00:49:03,566 --> 00:49:06,234
Shall l give
you another?

584
00:49:58,287 --> 00:50:00,580
Hello,
bag of blood.

585
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:03,917
You're coming with me.

586
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:12,467
Run!

587
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:31,695
You come with Murlaugh now.
You're one of us.

588
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:34,864
Not one of those
filthy vampires.

589
00:50:36,117 --> 00:50:37,617
Let me go!

590
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:40,954
Where are we going?

591
00:50:49,422 --> 00:50:50,463
Hold your breath.

592
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:52,215
What? No, no,
no, no, no, no.

593
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:05,270
Let's go!

594
00:51:05,354 --> 00:51:06,730
Not yet!

595
00:51:12,361 --> 00:51:14,237
Don't look behind you.

596
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:23,538
Oh, my God. Oh, my
God! Are you all right?

597
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:26,332
Come here!

598
00:51:31,881 --> 00:51:34,132
Breathe.

599
00:51:34,759 --> 00:51:37,177
GlRL 1: Right over
the plate!

600
00:51:37,261 --> 00:51:39,512
GlRL 2: Oh, my God.

601
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:41,014
Do you know
those guys?

602
00:51:43,142 --> 00:51:44,601
Are we there yet?

603
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:45,769
Almost.

604
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,650
Where are we?

605
00:51:52,985 --> 00:51:54,861
The Cirque's
winter campgrounds.

606
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:57,030
You'll be safe here
if they let you stay.

607
00:51:57,698 --> 00:51:59,324
Try to fit in.

608
00:52:02,036 --> 00:52:03,203
Come on.

609
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:04,579
So all the freaks
live here?

610
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:06,456
Yes.

611
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:15,089
Don't stare.

612
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:23,389
lt's really...

613
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:37,070
You want to go to my tent? You
know, we can rehearse in my tent.

614
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:39,239
l'm not gonna
rehearse in your tent.

615
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:42,784
lt'll be great, you know. You
always have fun in my tent.

616
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:50,416
Wait here for me.

617
00:52:51,544 --> 00:52:53,211
Well, l was
thinking about it.

618
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:55,004
l mean, you're not gonna be
able to do this forever, right?

619
00:52:55,089 --> 00:52:57,173
lf you set everything up,
so l can just fill it out.

620
00:52:57,258 --> 00:53:00,927
Neutral. The Cirque has
always remained neutral.

621
00:53:01,262 --> 00:53:03,221
That's how it has
survived all these years.

622
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:05,723
You'll still
be neutral.

623
00:53:05,808 --> 00:53:09,519
l'm not trying to drag you into anything.
l'm trying to keep myself out of it.

624
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:12,522
And why exactly do you
think Tiny wants this boy?

625
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:14,232
l'm not sure yet.

626
00:53:14,775 --> 00:53:16,526
But whenever Mr. Tiny
wants something,

627
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:19,362
l make it my policy to try
and keep him from it.

628
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,656
That's a
dangerous policy.

629
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:30,665
Hey, what are you doing?
That's Mr. Tall's tent.

630
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,960
Hi, l'm Darren.

631
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,461
What are you
doing here?

632
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:38,298
That's what l'm trying
to figure out.

633
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:41,217
You can listen
if you want.

634
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:45,930
How much does
the boy know?

635
00:53:46,015 --> 00:53:47,557
Nothing.

636
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:51,060
He's waiting by my tent if
you want to speak with him.

637
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:55,398
You know, Larten, the thing you
might not realize about children is,

638
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:59,819
they don't always do
what they're told!

639
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:04,157
Rebecca. Don't you have
work you should be doing?

640
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:07,744
Yes. Sorry, Mr. Tall. lt won't happen
again. l mean, l don't eavesdrop on people.

641
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:08,953
lt was his idea.

642
00:54:09,038 --> 00:54:10,455
l didn't make you
do anything.

643
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:12,332
Well, you couldn't make me
do anything if you tried.

644
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:13,499
Oh, really, huh?

645
00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:14,876
Enough. Rebecca,

646
00:54:15,753 --> 00:54:18,713
l would like you to take
Darren to Evra's tent.

647
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:21,841
Evra will be his roommate
while he stays with us.

648
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:26,346
You'll have to work, Darren.
Everybody here pitches in.

649
00:54:26,889 --> 00:54:28,097
That's fine.

650
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:32,894
l actually worked for my dad's
office a couple of weeks this summer.

651
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:35,021
l did photocopies, so...

652
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:43,780
This is on a temporary basis, Larten. l
can't endanger everybody for your sake.

653
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:45,698
Of course.
Thank you.

654
00:54:46,951 --> 00:54:49,827
So, what are you doing here
anyway, with all these freaks?

655
00:54:49,912 --> 00:54:53,331
Why? Do you have
a problem with freaks?

656
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:57,585
No, l mean, they kind
of freak me out, but...

657
00:54:57,670 --> 00:55:00,380
They freak you out.
Clever, really clever.

658
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:04,842
Well, l really have to get back to
work. Harkat can show you the way.

659
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:08,221
Harkat, take Darren
to Evra's tent, please.

660
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:17,021
Well, you better
follow him.

661
00:55:21,777 --> 00:55:23,778
Okay, see you sometime.

662
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:31,577
No, l saw what you did to my friend
Steve's hand at the theater, buddy.

663
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:40,461
Dude, l'm not giving
you my hand, okay?

664
00:55:45,718 --> 00:55:47,343
l'm sorry. Here.

665
00:55:50,264 --> 00:55:51,514
Harkat!

666
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:55,852
You have to stop biting people, or
no one will want to be around you.

667
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:02,442
You.

668
00:56:06,739 --> 00:56:07,905
Death.

669
00:56:09,408 --> 00:56:12,785
Redemption. Despair.

670
00:56:15,414 --> 00:56:18,458
Triumph. Disaster.

671
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,795
What did l say?

672
00:56:23,464 --> 00:56:26,799
"Death, redemption,
despair, triumph, disaster."

673
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:33,389
Well, don't worry about it. Go
ahead, Harkat. Take him to Evra's.

674
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:35,641
And no more teeth.

675
00:56:46,278 --> 00:56:48,488
You mean, this is it?

676
00:56:49,198 --> 00:56:53,951
Chill in the laundry for a
sec. There you go. Good girl.

677
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:59,332
Good snake. Love you.

678
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:06,714
So, l guess we're gonna be
roommates. So how are you f'd up?

679
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:09,509
F'd up?
Freaked up.

680
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:11,302
How... What kind
of freak are you?

681
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:14,347
Oh, l'm not a freak.
l'm normal.

682
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:16,724
You're normal?

683
00:57:16,809 --> 00:57:17,892
No. l mean,
l'm half vampire,

684
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:19,685
but l'm completely
normal.

685
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:22,647
You're a half vampire,
but you're normal.

686
00:57:24,316 --> 00:57:25,691
l like that.

687
00:57:26,735 --> 00:57:30,530
And don't worry about, like, if l'm
gonna drink your blood or anything.

688
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:33,866
l'm not gonna drink
anyone's blood.

689
00:57:36,537 --> 00:57:38,704
What a relief. Okay,
this isn't awkward at all.

690
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:41,165
This is your corner
of the tent. All right?

691
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:43,417
You do not cross over to
any other part of the tent,

692
00:57:43,502 --> 00:57:46,170
except to enter and
exit the tent. All right?

693
00:57:46,255 --> 00:57:50,466
And you are never, ever to touch my
stuff, especially this stuff over here.

694
00:57:50,551 --> 00:57:52,718
This is my
recording studio.

695
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:56,347
Oh, cool. Yeah, l... l actually
used to have a drum set,

696
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:59,934
but, you know, my parents
made me give it away, so...

697
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:01,853
Mmm.
Yeah.

698
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:04,272
Well, there are
no parents here.

699
00:58:07,151 --> 00:58:08,151
Oh...

700
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:14,198
Yeah. Shedding,
itches like crazy.

701
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:16,868
You should actually go wash your
hand off before you get pink eye.

702
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:22,707
Did you forget to tell me you were going
to go away for a couple of days? Huh?

703
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:26,127
l can't believe you're treating me
like this. l've been worried sick.

704
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:27,837
Why can't you just
get a cell phone?

705
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:29,589
Because vampires
don't need cell phones.

706
00:58:29,715 --> 00:58:33,926
"Vampires don't need this,
vampires don't need that."

707
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:36,179
l'll tell you what
vampires need.

708
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:39,473
They need to listen. Didn't l
tell you that l had a foreboding?

709
00:58:39,558 --> 00:58:42,852
And what do you do? You
show up here with that kid.

710
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:45,771
lt's been a long night. l
just flitted across two states.

711
00:58:45,856 --> 00:58:47,940
l think l'll just hit
the pine early.

712
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:49,358
No, wait.

713
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:54,947
You don't love me
anymore. lt's my beard.

714
00:58:56,283 --> 00:58:59,827
You know how l feel about you. l
just don't want to outlive anyone.

715
00:58:59,912 --> 00:59:04,624
lt's depressing watching people you
care about grow old while you stay young.

716
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:07,710
Have you looked at yourself
in the mirror lately?

717
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:10,463
You're no kid.

718
00:59:11,924 --> 00:59:15,051
Oh, no, no. l'm still
angry at you. Mmm-mmm.

719
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:17,303
Mmm-mmm.

720
00:59:17,596 --> 00:59:21,891
Your mouth says no,
but your beard says yes.

721
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:24,060
l can't believe
he's gone, man.

722
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:25,728
l know. He was
like my best friend.

723
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:27,230
No, he was
my best friend.

724
00:59:27,314 --> 00:59:28,940
l knew him first.
So what?

725
00:59:29,024 --> 00:59:30,983
l thought he
was a dick.

726
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:32,735
What?
What?

727
00:59:33,028 --> 00:59:34,528
Dude.
Oh, my...

728
00:59:34,613 --> 00:59:37,448
Here, get up before one of the
teachers see you. That kid's psycho.

729
00:59:42,496 --> 00:59:47,458
Mr. Leonard, what you got for
me here? Finish the quiz already?

730
00:59:59,888 --> 01:00:01,347
MR. TlNY: Careful.
Whoa!

731
01:00:02,683 --> 01:00:04,809
The first step
is a big one.

732
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:09,772
Oh, l know. You miss
the one known as Darren.

733
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:15,361
You feel betrayed, abandoned.
You're a loyal friend,

734
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:17,738
unlike him.

735
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:21,784
Darren was
a loyal friend.

736
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,536
Oh, really?

737
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:28,624
What if l told you he's still
alive? He's taken your place,

738
01:00:28,709 --> 01:00:32,461
stealing your dreams. Oh, l know.

739
01:00:32,546 --> 01:00:36,132
You dream of killing people,
drinking their blood.

740
01:00:36,216 --> 01:00:41,012
You dream of leading a
great, bloodthirsty army.

741
01:00:41,096 --> 01:00:42,888
Who the hell are you?

742
01:00:43,515 --> 01:00:45,266
l'm Mr. Tiny.

743
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:46,726
Are you a vampire?

744
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:50,438
No, l'm not a vampire.
l'm not a Vampaneze.

745
01:00:50,522 --> 01:00:53,232
l'm an aficionado.

746
01:00:54,401 --> 01:00:58,070
l want to see
a marvelous war.

747
01:00:58,155 --> 01:01:00,698
What do you want
from me, you freak?

748
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:05,786
l'm not a freak.
l despise freaks.

749
01:01:05,871 --> 01:01:09,165
Can a freak travel back and
forth between life and death?

750
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:10,666
l think not.

751
01:01:10,751 --> 01:01:14,670
Can a freak create new life from
rotting flesh and dead souls?

752
01:01:14,755 --> 01:01:15,921
Please.

753
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:21,510
Can a freak bring about the
apocalypse and rule the world?

754
01:01:22,262 --> 01:01:23,596
No.

755
01:01:24,973 --> 01:01:30,853
Sadly, neither can l, not
without help. l need a champion.

756
01:01:31,772 --> 01:01:36,400
One of two boys,
two dear friends.

757
01:01:38,028 --> 01:01:41,864
And by the way,
l love your DNA.

758
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:50,790
You care
for a pancake?

759
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:53,042
No, l can't. l'm...

760
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:54,752
We know
what you are.

761
01:01:55,587 --> 01:01:57,380
You're bad news.
That's what.

762
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:02,927
But nothing l couldn't deal
with in just about two bites.

763
01:02:04,346 --> 01:02:07,348
Don't mind him. He
just needs some Ex-Lax.

764
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:08,891
Welcome to
the Cirque.

765
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:10,309
Thank you.

766
01:02:10,811 --> 01:02:13,396
Would you like to eat one of
my hands? l can grow them back.

767
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:14,605
Yeah, they
are delicious.

768
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:16,732
Hey, Vampelina.

769
01:02:16,817 --> 01:02:18,526
Come on, we gotta go
clean out Wolfie's cage,

770
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:22,696
and then Crepsley left, like, a
list of stuff for you to do for him.

771
01:02:22,781 --> 01:02:24,156
lt looks like you're
Crepsley's bitch now.

772
01:02:24,241 --> 01:02:25,574
Evra.
What?

773
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:34,625
Okay, so you guys are
gonna do it. And go.

774
01:02:43,677 --> 01:02:46,429
l can't believe the tiny
people eat these rats.

775
01:02:46,513 --> 01:02:48,180
They'll eat you
if you don't watch out.

776
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:49,849
Don't!

777
01:03:06,867 --> 01:03:09,326
So where do you
come from anyways?

778
01:03:21,715 --> 01:03:23,716
l guess l could probably,
like, open this up,

779
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:27,136
and you'd probably turn
into dust or something, huh?

780
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:30,514
You wouldn't like that
now, would you, Dracula?

781
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:32,141
Who's the boss
now, baby?

782
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:37,396
Okay. Concentrate now.
How hard can it be to flit?

783
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:54,455
Ow. Perfect.

784
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:16,018
What's the point?

785
01:04:23,735 --> 01:04:26,820
l'm just not that
much of a freak.

786
01:04:26,905 --> 01:04:28,614
Gertha, you're
a major freak.

787
01:04:34,746 --> 01:04:37,456
Sorry, you're
not my type.

788
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:40,960
Do you ever
miss your family?

789
01:04:43,755 --> 01:04:44,964
Not really.

790
01:04:45,048 --> 01:04:48,008
l joined the Cirque when l
was two. Two days old, that is.

791
01:04:48,093 --> 01:04:51,929
Mr. Tall found me in a dumpster.
So l guess this is my family.

792
01:04:54,224 --> 01:04:57,977
Dumpster baby,
oh, dumpster baby

793
01:04:58,061 --> 01:05:01,564
l wanna be your
dumpster baby

794
01:05:04,234 --> 01:05:05,276
No.

795
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:27,423
Hey, this is Steve.
You know what to do.

796
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:32,094
What are you doing?

797
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:33,304
Oh, nothing.

798
01:05:34,556 --> 01:05:36,015
May l see it?

799
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:38,934
Yeah, l guess.

800
01:05:39,019 --> 01:05:40,853
l've always wanted
one of these.

801
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:44,398
Hey! What are
you doing?

802
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:47,109
We must be very careful
who we talk to, Darren.

803
01:06:04,044 --> 01:06:06,879
Go to your tent
and stay there with Evra.

804
01:06:22,729 --> 01:06:26,023
Yes. l have returned.

805
01:06:30,195 --> 01:06:33,030
l have returned!

806
01:06:34,074 --> 01:06:38,869
Unacceptable. Unforgivable.
To blood a child?

807
01:06:41,331 --> 01:06:43,999
By the way, is he drinking
enough blood?

808
01:06:44,084 --> 01:06:46,168
He's not drinking
any blood.

809
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:47,586
Not drinking blood?

810
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:51,256
Crepsley, don't you know
he has to? He must.

811
01:06:52,759 --> 01:06:55,928
Or perhaps you're worried
he'll love it too much.

812
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:00,391
He might be
Vampaneze at heart.

813
01:07:00,475 --> 01:07:02,142
You'd like that.

814
01:07:02,227 --> 01:07:04,520
You've been favoring them
for the last 100 years.

815
01:07:04,604 --> 01:07:09,692
On the contrary, l'm strictly
neutral, like the Cirque.

816
01:07:09,776 --> 01:07:11,944
Correct, Mr. Tall?

817
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:15,030
Correct.

818
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:18,409
Then tell us
why you want him.

819
01:07:18,493 --> 01:07:21,870
lt's one of your self-fulfilling
prophecies, isn't it?

820
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:24,790
Well, one does dream
of the cataclysm.

821
01:07:27,419 --> 01:07:31,046
This truce may
not last forever.

822
01:07:31,131 --> 01:07:34,299
There might be new leaders.
New blood, as it were.

823
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:39,138
Perhaps a boy,
a bloodthirsty boy.

824
01:07:40,515 --> 01:07:42,808
lt's all been written.

825
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:46,145
Then why do you care? You're
up to something, Desmond.

826
01:07:46,229 --> 01:07:50,399
Me? l may
write the script,

827
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:54,528
but the characters have a
tendency to do as they please.

828
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:58,824
You, for example, have an
unseemly amount of free will.

829
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:04,496
Now, Mr. Tall, will you be
reasonable and give me the child?

830
01:08:04,998 --> 01:08:09,084
l've always done what you ask.
l'm not one to cause trouble.

831
01:08:12,422 --> 01:08:17,092
But l need to think about all this.
l won't make a decision hastily.

832
01:08:17,177 --> 01:08:20,846
You know, l always get
what l want, in the end.

833
01:08:31,065 --> 01:08:34,526
MR. TlNY: Keep an eye
on him, my pets.

834
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:49,541
Hey, dude. Sorry,
we're on our own today.

835
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:52,961
Rebecca's back in
the costume shop.

836
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:16,902
Hey.

837
01:09:18,071 --> 01:09:20,322
l'm here for
Crepsley's cape.

838
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:21,657
lt's that red one
with, like, the...

839
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:23,992
l know what Crepsley's
cape looks like.

840
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:26,078
What do your
friends want?

841
01:09:28,331 --> 01:09:29,790
Hey! Beat it!

842
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:34,711
Does this trailer have, like,
a back entrance or something?

843
01:09:34,796 --> 01:09:38,340
Yeah, it's right back there.
Wait, your pants are ripped.

844
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:42,594
Take them off.
Try this pair on.

845
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:46,056
They fit.

846
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:47,307
Yeah.

847
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:55,941
So, you know,
Rebecca, you...

848
01:09:56,943 --> 01:10:00,529
You never really told me what
you're doing here with the Cirque.

849
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:03,448
Well, Darren,
since you ask,

850
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:06,577
l'm a monkey girl.

851
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:08,912
You're a what?

852
01:10:08,997 --> 01:10:10,080
What?

853
01:10:10,164 --> 01:10:13,458
Nothing, l thought you just
said you were a monkey girl.

854
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:15,085
Well, oh, yeah.

855
01:10:17,088 --> 01:10:18,171
Yeah.

856
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:24,303
What does that mean?

857
01:10:24,387 --> 01:10:28,640
lt means l have a tail. Do
you have a problem with that?

858
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:33,937
No, because... 'Cause
you're joking, right?

859
01:10:34,022 --> 01:10:38,650
No, l'm not joking. l keep it wrapped
up because people kept stepping on it.

860
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:41,486
Oh.

861
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:42,863
Yeah.

862
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:46,617
Anyway, your pants
look really good.

863
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:51,496
Yeah, l know. You picked
it out. That's really good.

864
01:10:59,339 --> 01:11:00,339
Shush!

865
01:11:01,132 --> 01:11:03,967
Thanks. They've been
spying on me all day.

866
01:11:06,471 --> 01:11:10,599
So if you were interested in a
girl, okay, and she had like...

867
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:15,437
Like a tail, let's say,
would that be a problem or...

868
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:17,564
Well, l'll put it
to you this way.

869
01:11:17,649 --> 01:11:19,441
lf you had told me a
couple hundred years ago

870
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:22,444
that l would someday be dating a
woman with bristles on her chin,

871
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:26,239
l would have told you you
were insane. But here we are.

872
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:32,621
By the way, there's a new rule.
You're not to leave camp anymore.

873
01:11:33,164 --> 01:11:34,164
Why not?

874
01:11:34,248 --> 01:11:35,582
Because l said so.

875
01:11:37,877 --> 01:11:41,380
You're not my dad. You can't
just tell me what to do...

876
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:47,010
When was the last time
you were in a fight?

877
01:11:47,095 --> 01:11:48,345
Uh...
Second grade.

878
01:11:49,389 --> 01:11:51,306
Steve's usually the one
that gets in all the fights.

879
01:11:51,391 --> 01:11:53,976
Well, Steve's not
here to fight for you.

880
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:56,228
And what if
l wasn't, either?

881
01:11:57,188 --> 01:12:00,315
What if you were alone in the dark
and someone wanted to kill you?

882
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:03,276
Rip out your heart
and drink its blood?

883
01:12:03,361 --> 01:12:04,695
What then?

884
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:10,033
Crepsley?

885
01:12:12,662 --> 01:12:14,329
Crepsley,
come on.

886
01:12:18,209 --> 01:12:19,459
Crepsley?

887
01:12:25,633 --> 01:12:26,717
You're hurting me.

888
01:12:26,801 --> 01:12:30,053
What are you going
to do about it? Well?

889
01:12:35,226 --> 01:12:38,603
You're soft. You're a soft little boy.

890
01:12:38,688 --> 01:12:42,024
They're looking for you, Darren.
This is not the schoolyard.

891
01:12:42,108 --> 01:12:46,528
You either have to learn to fight or
to run. So which is it going to be?

892
01:12:57,457 --> 01:13:01,752
Good. But don't use your fist.
You have something better.

893
01:13:01,836 --> 01:13:05,255
Use your fingernails
like a dagger. Watch.

894
01:13:09,969 --> 01:13:13,889
Try it. Extend your fingers
and follow all the way through.

895
01:13:13,973 --> 01:13:15,849
Use all your strength.

896
01:13:21,731 --> 01:13:22,981
Ow!

897
01:13:23,775 --> 01:13:26,234
God, l think
l broke a nail.

898
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:27,652
You broke a nail?

899
01:13:29,947 --> 01:13:32,866
You need blood. We have
a lot of work to do.

900
01:13:38,498 --> 01:13:39,915
Blood will have blood.

901
01:13:39,999 --> 01:13:41,374
Blood will have blood.

902
01:13:41,459 --> 01:13:44,920
Are you ready, you filthy
little pig, to be stuck?

903
01:13:45,004 --> 01:13:47,380
Do you renounce living
with the living?

904
01:13:48,049 --> 01:13:50,675
Are you prepared
to die with the dead?

905
01:14:17,912 --> 01:14:20,247
Steve, what the hell
are you doing?

906
01:14:20,331 --> 01:14:21,915
Well, hi,
Mr. Kersey.

907
01:14:22,542 --> 01:14:24,376
l just wanted to
stop by real quick

908
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:27,129
and actually apologize
for the way, you know,

909
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:28,296
l've been acting
in school lately.

910
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:30,590
lt's 3:00 a.m.

911
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:33,718
My teachers troubled
me when l was a lad.

912
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:42,227
They caned me and caned
me till l was bloody.

913
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:49,860
Then one day, l took up
a broken switch,

914
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:53,655
and l rammed it in
my teacher's eyeball.

915
01:14:56,742 --> 01:14:58,285
Who are you?

916
01:14:58,369 --> 01:14:59,786
l'm his mentor.

917
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:07,919
You see, Steve?

918
01:15:09,046 --> 01:15:10,046
Ow!

919
01:15:12,008 --> 01:15:14,926
This is what Crepsley
wants us to live with.

920
01:15:23,144 --> 01:15:27,439
So, Mr. Kersey,
what you got for me?

921
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:30,859
So you really
don't kill people?

922
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:31,985
No, Darren.

923
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:36,865
You just sedate them and feed
a little bit, and then leave.

924
01:15:36,949 --> 01:15:39,034
l actually developed
the method.

925
01:15:39,118 --> 01:15:42,829
Well, two other vampires
and l, Gavner and Vincent.

926
01:15:43,748 --> 01:15:46,708
We were the freaks of the vampire
world. No one understood us.

927
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:48,919
And then they
started to realize

928
01:15:49,003 --> 01:15:51,922
that if you don't kill your prey
every time like a little piggy,

929
01:15:52,006 --> 01:15:56,843
then you don't get hunted down by irate
townspeople with pitchforks and torches.

930
01:15:57,428 --> 01:16:02,140
And now half the vampires feed this
way, and the other half hate us.

931
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:06,311
Quiet now.

932
01:16:15,488 --> 01:16:17,489
Whoa! How'd
you do that?

933
01:16:18,157 --> 01:16:21,451
Vampires can exhale a gas
that knocks out humans.

934
01:16:21,535 --> 01:16:22,577
Really?

935
01:16:22,662 --> 01:16:25,997
Drink some blood, you'll be
able to do all kinds of things.

936
01:16:26,082 --> 01:16:31,169
Now, we just make a small incision
in his shoulder. Right here.

937
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:35,799
And then you
take a sip.

938
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:40,762
Don't worry. He won't become a vampire
unless you exchange blood with him.

939
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:45,350
Go ahead. l had some a couple of
days ago. lt's very refreshing.

940
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:47,686
No, l'm not gonna
drink human blood.

941
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:51,481
Hurry up, before someone sees
us. We haven't got all night.

942
01:16:52,525 --> 01:16:54,150
l'm not going to.

943
01:16:57,780 --> 01:17:02,117
You have to drink blood, Darren, or
you'll die. lt's as simple as that.

944
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:09,040
Damn kid is gonna
get himself killed.

945
01:17:11,294 --> 01:17:14,129
Larten, what made
you blood him?

946
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:18,091
l needed someone
to run errands for me.

947
01:17:18,175 --> 01:17:21,344
Oh, come on, you didn't
need to blood him for that.

948
01:17:21,429 --> 01:17:24,556
l had a feeling if l didn't,
something terrible would happen to him.

949
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:29,436
Something terrible? As
opposed to becoming a vampire?

950
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:34,482
l think you're
getting lonely.

951
01:17:34,567 --> 01:17:39,529
After 200 years of living alone, why
on earth would l suddenly become lonely?

952
01:17:39,613 --> 01:17:43,742
l don't know. Midlife
crisis? What is it?

953
01:17:45,036 --> 01:17:46,161
They're here.

954
01:18:44,595 --> 01:18:45,929
Watch out!

955
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:03,321
That's not fair.
Back!

956
01:19:03,406 --> 01:19:05,490
Darren,
get out of here!

957
01:19:06,117 --> 01:19:07,200
Duck!

958
01:19:12,873 --> 01:19:13,998
Move.

959
01:19:18,712 --> 01:19:19,921
Get in.

960
01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:23,133
Psst.

961
01:19:59,253 --> 01:20:01,921
Hey! Hey!

962
01:20:03,174 --> 01:20:05,967
Look, l don't even
like the Wolfman,

963
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:09,679
but that don't mean you can come
in here and beat up on a freak!

964
01:20:09,763 --> 01:20:11,723
You're messing with the
wrong sideshow, baby!

965
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:13,433
l'll bite your
damn noses off!

966
01:20:13,517 --> 01:20:15,935
l'm gonna ram
my head up your ass.

967
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:17,103
Stop!

968
01:20:18,772 --> 01:20:19,898
Stop!

969
01:20:21,567 --> 01:20:23,735
There'll be
no fighting here.

970
01:20:25,404 --> 01:20:30,408
How dare you enter this campground?
The Vampire Council will hear of this.

971
01:20:34,497 --> 01:20:37,624
Tell the little vampire
it's time to come home.

972
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:42,837
lt's almost dawn. l have a spare coffin
here. l suggest you get some rest as well.

973
01:20:42,922 --> 01:20:45,298
Aren't we gonna, like, double
back and attack them or something?

974
01:20:45,382 --> 01:20:46,674
Do you want
to stay alive?

975
01:20:46,759 --> 01:20:51,012
You're not even drinking blood yet.
l doubt you'd be much good in a fight.

976
01:20:51,096 --> 01:20:52,889
Well, what if they
hurt someone?

977
01:20:52,973 --> 01:20:55,391
People can look
out for themselves.

978
01:20:55,935 --> 01:20:58,269
You've been
looking out for me.

979
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:00,396
Why?

980
01:21:00,481 --> 01:21:03,525
Why? Because l'm
an idiot, that's why.

981
01:21:04,401 --> 01:21:07,153
Only an idiot would spit
in the eye of Mr. Tiny.

982
01:21:07,238 --> 01:21:10,698
Because he doesn't just kill
people, he brings them back, as well.

983
01:21:10,783 --> 01:21:14,410
And when l finally die,
l plan on staying dead.

984
01:21:15,788 --> 01:21:20,291
Life may be meaningless, but
death l still have hope for.

985
01:21:21,418 --> 01:21:23,753
Life isn't
meaningless.

986
01:21:23,837 --> 01:21:28,007
Tell me that after 200 years
of it, kid. Good day.

987
01:21:38,352 --> 01:21:39,519
You know
l never liked him.

988
01:21:39,603 --> 01:21:40,728
l never did,
either.

989
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:42,564
l told you
when l first saw him.

990
01:21:42,648 --> 01:21:44,357
Should never
have let him in.

991
01:21:44,441 --> 01:21:45,733
We all know
it's his fault.

992
01:21:45,818 --> 01:21:49,153
l just can't believe he has the
nerve to walk around in here.

993
01:21:49,238 --> 01:21:50,905
That poor Rebecca.

994
01:21:55,286 --> 01:21:58,871
They took her?
Where?

995
01:21:59,999 --> 01:22:05,044
l don't know, but they said
to tell you to come home.

996
01:22:07,047 --> 01:22:11,843
Which, of course, you're not gonna
do. Wait, Darren, Darren. No, buddy.

997
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:13,177
Those guys are huge, man.

998
01:22:20,102 --> 01:22:22,437
Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Shan.
Hey, Annie.

999
01:22:22,521 --> 01:22:24,564
Steve. What are
you doing here?

1000
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:30,069
Well, you know, l've been thinking.
You guys probably really miss your son.

1001
01:22:30,154 --> 01:22:34,657
And my mom is drunk half the time, so
she doesn't really notice l'm there.

1002
01:22:35,534 --> 01:22:38,161
How about you
guys adopt me?

1003
01:22:41,498 --> 01:22:42,874
No interest?

1004
01:22:44,251 --> 01:22:46,669
Told you they
wouldn't go for it.

1005
01:22:47,546 --> 01:22:48,546
Hmm.

1006
01:22:49,089 --> 01:22:50,757
How disappointing.

1007
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:56,179
So few "people" have the
parenting instinct the way l do.

1008
01:23:01,935 --> 01:23:03,686
Ready for the prom?

1009
01:23:15,741 --> 01:23:19,494
Make new friends,
but keep the old

1010
01:23:19,578 --> 01:23:22,955
One is silver
and the other's gold

1011
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:27,293
Make new friends,
but keep the old

1012
01:23:27,378 --> 01:23:30,713
One is silver
and the other's gold

1013
01:24:22,975 --> 01:24:27,353
Hey, Octa. Say goodbye
to Crepsley for me, okay?

1014
01:24:27,438 --> 01:24:29,731
Tell him l'm sorry
but l have to go home.

1015
01:24:34,653 --> 01:24:36,988
lt's time, isn't it?

1016
01:24:59,553 --> 01:25:03,347
Twenty-six.
Twenty-seven, 27.

1017
01:25:03,432 --> 01:25:04,640
Twenty-seven.

1018
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:07,435
All right, no, no.
Twenty-eight.

1019
01:25:07,519 --> 01:25:09,353
May l borrow
a couple of these?

1020
01:25:11,732 --> 01:25:14,692
Don't forget to bring them
back, though. Both of them.

1021
01:25:15,444 --> 01:25:18,404
You're in danger,
terrible danger.

1022
01:25:18,489 --> 01:25:20,865
Your life and soul
are in jeopardy.

1023
01:25:22,868 --> 01:25:23,868
What did l say?

1024
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:25,203
Nothing. Something
about the weather.

1025
01:25:25,287 --> 01:25:28,831
Chance of thunderstorms tomorrow.
Don't worry. l'll stay indoors.

1026
01:26:00,948 --> 01:26:03,616
Applause! Applause!

1027
01:26:06,286 --> 01:26:09,413
Look. Little vampire.

1028
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:12,625
Take a bow.

1029
01:26:12,876 --> 01:26:14,710
Where are my family
and my friends?

1030
01:26:14,795 --> 01:26:15,837
Please.

1031
01:26:15,921 --> 01:26:19,590
Must have patience.
Will spoil the show.

1032
01:26:24,930 --> 01:26:27,932
Do you like? Does Murlaugh have talent?

1033
01:26:29,017 --> 01:26:31,894
No? What do you
know about talent?

1034
01:26:34,064 --> 01:26:39,861
Where is Crepsley?

1035
01:26:42,322 --> 01:26:44,866
Too bad for Crapsley.

1036
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:48,536
Because he will
miss the show!

1037
01:26:50,122 --> 01:26:54,959
Here is freak all
wrapped up tight.

1038
01:26:57,421 --> 01:27:03,092
And here are beloved family
members. Applause. Applause.

1039
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:09,307
Hello, beloved son.
Hello, loving parents.

1040
01:27:09,391 --> 01:27:14,103
Hello, cute little sister.
Four bags of blood.

1041
01:27:15,606 --> 01:27:17,106
Don't worry.
You're all gonna be okay.

1042
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:19,567
Will be better than okay.

1043
01:27:20,319 --> 01:27:23,821
Will be delicious!

1044
01:27:25,365 --> 01:27:27,825
But now, may l present

1045
01:27:27,951 --> 01:27:31,370
reunion with oldest friend
and blood brother,

1046
01:27:31,455 --> 01:27:34,749
with he that shall
one day rule us all,

1047
01:27:34,833 --> 01:27:39,462
the one known as Steve.

1048
01:27:40,714 --> 01:27:42,840
Thank you!
Thank you!

1049
01:27:44,509 --> 01:27:45,843
Steve.

1050
01:27:46,428 --> 01:27:47,637
You're alive?

1051
01:27:49,681 --> 01:27:52,683
You know, that was really an
asshole thing for you to do.

1052
01:27:52,768 --> 01:27:56,062
Make your whole family and your
secret best friend go through all that?

1053
01:27:56,229 --> 01:27:58,773
Look, l didn't mean
to hurt anybody, okay?

1054
01:27:58,857 --> 01:28:00,650
Who cares what
you meant to do?

1055
01:28:00,734 --> 01:28:03,861
What you did was take my
place. That was my dream.

1056
01:28:05,614 --> 01:28:08,032
Steve, what are
you doing with him?

1057
01:28:08,116 --> 01:28:10,117
Who? Murlaugh?

1058
01:28:10,535 --> 01:28:12,870
Come on, man, he's
not as bad as he looks.

1059
01:28:12,955 --> 01:28:15,998
You know, for one thing, he didn't
say l had bad blood like Crepsley.

1060
01:28:16,083 --> 01:28:18,417
And for another thing,
he didn't lie to me.

1061
01:28:18,502 --> 01:28:21,170
And you know what?
They think l'm awesome.

1062
01:28:21,254 --> 01:28:25,549
They say l have a destiny,
or whatever. Look at you.

1063
01:28:26,551 --> 01:28:30,096
Who wants to be a vampire
anyways? Vampires suck.

1064
01:28:30,347 --> 01:28:31,931
Vampaneze rule!

1065
01:28:32,057 --> 01:28:33,724
Juicy!

1066
01:28:33,809 --> 01:28:36,560
First guy l killed,
Mr. Kersey.

1067
01:28:36,645 --> 01:28:39,730
Blood just gets me going,
you know what l mean?

1068
01:28:41,608 --> 01:28:43,776
l wouldn't know. l
haven't been drinking any.

1069
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:49,865
l know you. Always trying to look
like Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes all the time.

1070
01:28:50,617 --> 01:28:52,660
l bet you'll, like,
resist drinking blood

1071
01:28:52,744 --> 01:28:54,495
and resist drinking
and resist drinking it,

1072
01:28:54,579 --> 01:28:57,415
at the last second become
this total bloodhound!

1073
01:28:59,626 --> 01:29:01,085
All right, man,
here's the deal.

1074
01:29:01,169 --> 01:29:04,422
See, the fat guy, he still wants you on
the team, and despite everything else,

1075
01:29:04,506 --> 01:29:07,425
you are still my best friend.
So l'll tell you what,

1076
01:29:07,509 --> 01:29:10,636
l'll make you a deal that
might just save your ass.

1077
01:29:10,721 --> 01:29:13,139
lf you kill your family,
l'll let the freak go.

1078
01:29:15,058 --> 01:29:17,435
Wait. My bad,
that's backwards.

1079
01:29:17,519 --> 01:29:20,021
lf you kill the freak,
l'll let your family live.

1080
01:29:20,105 --> 01:29:22,606
What? Let the
juicy one go?

1081
01:29:22,899 --> 01:29:26,402
Hey, look, man, it's part of
the plan. Talk to Mr. Tiny.

1082
01:29:28,155 --> 01:29:29,905
So what do you say?

1083
01:29:30,115 --> 01:29:33,367
Just kill her. Oh, yeah, you
got to drink her blood, too.

1084
01:29:33,827 --> 01:29:35,953
You can do her in
with this.

1085
01:30:02,981 --> 01:30:04,815
MR. TlNY: Wait!

1086
01:30:06,985 --> 01:30:09,236
Allow him in,
gentlemen.

1087
01:30:10,489 --> 01:30:12,490
l want to see
this play out.

1088
01:30:13,658 --> 01:30:18,120
Man, that was pathetic. You're
totally weak. You need some blood.

1089
01:30:21,208 --> 01:30:22,583
Murlaugh.

1090
01:30:22,667 --> 01:30:23,793
Finally.

1091
01:30:27,672 --> 01:30:29,757
And we thought you
weren't gonna show.

1092
01:31:25,814 --> 01:31:27,857
l hate spiders!

1093
01:31:47,252 --> 01:31:48,586
Darren. Come here.

1094
01:31:50,714 --> 01:31:51,881
Okay.

1095
01:31:55,802 --> 01:31:57,428
ls that your tail?

1096
01:31:57,512 --> 01:31:58,804
Well, yeah.

1097
01:31:59,055 --> 01:32:01,432
l'm really sorry l got you
involved in this, okay? l...

1098
01:32:01,516 --> 01:32:04,935
Please stop staring.
So you really need blood?

1099
01:32:05,896 --> 01:32:07,396
Yeah.
All right.

1100
01:32:08,732 --> 01:32:11,901
Can you just take
a little? Go ahead.

1101
01:32:12,736 --> 01:32:14,278
l'm offering it to you.

1102
01:32:15,947 --> 01:32:19,700
Thanks. But l just
can't lose it.

1103
01:32:19,784 --> 01:32:20,784
What?

1104
01:32:21,203 --> 01:32:23,621
Whatever's still
making me human.

1105
01:32:24,289 --> 01:32:29,501
Darren, being human's not about
what you are. lt's about who you are.

1106
01:33:13,046 --> 01:33:14,129
No.

1107
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:03,762
He's all yours, lad.

1108
01:34:24,242 --> 01:34:27,077
Good.
Right in the heart.

1109
01:34:28,913 --> 01:34:31,915
So fair and foul a day
l have not seen.

1110
01:34:35,587 --> 01:34:38,213
My people aren't
weak like yours.

1111
01:34:39,257 --> 01:34:41,508
They will avenge me,
Crepsley.

1112
01:34:47,140 --> 01:34:52,102
The truce, 100 years,
is over.

1113
01:34:54,397 --> 01:34:56,398
The war begins.

1114
01:35:05,617 --> 01:35:08,702
Marvelous. Magnificent.

1115
01:35:08,787 --> 01:35:13,374
Really. Bravo. Bravo.

1116
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:18,045
lt's just like you said.
We started the war.

1117
01:35:22,884 --> 01:35:27,012
lt won't start a war if
nobody hears about it.

1118
01:35:32,644 --> 01:35:36,480
Young people today are
so difficult to control.

1119
01:35:48,535 --> 01:35:49,535
l hate you.

1120
01:35:49,619 --> 01:35:50,661
l hate you!

1121
01:35:50,745 --> 01:35:52,663
l became a vampire
to save you, Steve.

1122
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:54,123
Thanks.

1123
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:10,973
Go ahead. Just do it!

1124
01:36:25,029 --> 01:36:26,780
That's enough, boys.

1125
01:36:31,703 --> 01:36:33,871
Steve, come with me.

1126
01:36:34,622 --> 01:36:35,789
Not before
l kick his...

1127
01:36:35,874 --> 01:36:37,875
You will behave!

1128
01:36:39,377 --> 01:36:42,713
lt's not time for you to fight. Not yet.

1129
01:36:44,215 --> 01:36:46,341
What does that mean?

1130
01:36:46,426 --> 01:36:48,719
Oh, it's all written
down in a book.

1131
01:36:49,637 --> 01:36:52,055
You do read books,
don't you?

1132
01:36:59,105 --> 01:37:00,397
Steve.

1133
01:37:03,902 --> 01:37:05,819
Look, don't...
Don't go.

1134
01:37:07,530 --> 01:37:10,199
What else am
l supposed to do, man?

1135
01:37:10,283 --> 01:37:11,950
Live with you
and a bunch of freaks?

1136
01:37:13,661 --> 01:37:15,370
lt's too late now.

1137
01:37:16,414 --> 01:37:18,582
l have my destiny,
and you have yours.

1138
01:37:19,584 --> 01:37:23,921
How poignant. The parting
of two dear friends.

1139
01:37:24,422 --> 01:37:26,507
Such sweet sorrow.

1140
01:37:27,759 --> 01:37:31,887
Then again, you will
come home to us one day.

1141
01:37:32,555 --> 01:37:35,057
My prodigal son.

1142
01:37:35,141 --> 01:37:39,478
After all, you are
the bloodthirsty one.

1143
01:37:40,438 --> 01:37:45,609
No. Just because l'm a vampire
doesn't mean l'm bloodthirsty.

1144
01:37:47,403 --> 01:37:50,113
lt's not about what you are.
lt's about who you are.

1145
01:37:58,957 --> 01:37:59,957
Oh.

1146
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:01,833
l almost forgot.

1147
01:38:53,511 --> 01:38:55,220
Cover yourself.

1148
01:38:57,515 --> 01:38:59,850
You have to teach me
how to do that someday.

1149
01:38:59,934 --> 01:39:03,103
Oh, l'll teach you
everything, son.

1150
01:39:03,187 --> 01:39:09,359
All my gibes and gambols. Now,
ready to go meet your people?

1151
01:39:29,422 --> 01:39:30,797
Bye, Annie.

1152
01:39:39,057 --> 01:39:41,224
Will it work?
Hypnotizing them?

1153
01:39:42,393 --> 01:39:46,063
lt works on the memories, but
not on the emotions, not really.

1154
01:39:47,231 --> 01:39:50,567
They'll always feel that
you're still alive, somehow.

1155
01:39:50,943 --> 01:39:52,736
Well, that's good,
right?

1156
01:39:52,820 --> 01:39:54,071
ls it?

1157
01:40:05,416 --> 01:40:07,626
Hey, can l ask
you something?

1158
01:40:11,089 --> 01:40:12,756
Can l kiss you?

1159
01:40:13,925 --> 01:40:19,262
Darren, l let you drink my
blood. Sure, you can kiss me.

1160
01:40:42,954 --> 01:40:46,289
Come on. We don't have all night.
l have an injured spider here.

1161
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:52,838
All right, how are we going to do
this? l can't carry the both of you.

1162
01:40:54,006 --> 01:40:57,634
You carry Rebecca.
l can flit now.

1163
01:40:57,719 --> 01:40:59,386
Just like a real vampire.

1164
01:41:01,431 --> 01:41:04,307
Oh, Larten, you did it.

1165
01:41:04,809 --> 01:41:07,060
You stuck your
neck out for him.

1166
01:41:07,145 --> 01:41:10,439
You'd think a vampire would know
better than to stick his neck out.

1167
01:41:11,983 --> 01:41:13,692
l am proud of you.

1168
01:41:17,447 --> 01:41:19,656
All those who vote
for making Darren

1169
01:41:19,741 --> 01:41:23,785
a member of the Cirque
raise your hands.

1170
01:41:30,460 --> 01:41:31,918
One hand, Evra.

1171
01:41:32,003 --> 01:41:33,211
Damn it.

1172
01:41:35,757 --> 01:41:38,800
lt's done.
He will stay.

1173
01:41:45,224 --> 01:41:46,850
So we get to stay.

1174
01:41:48,603 --> 01:41:50,604
Not for long,
l'm afraid.

1175
01:41:50,980 --> 01:41:52,731
You know, Crepsley,
it's okay.

1176
01:41:55,651 --> 01:41:59,613
lt's weird. l spent so much time wishing
that none of this would have happened

1177
01:41:59,697 --> 01:42:03,867
and that we never would have been
to the Cirque in the first place.

1178
01:42:05,912 --> 01:42:09,873
But now l really can't imagine
my life happening any other way.

1179
01:42:13,544 --> 01:42:15,045
Dawn's coming.

1180
01:42:16,422 --> 01:42:20,091
l had something made for
you. lt's in your tent.

1181
01:42:20,176 --> 01:42:21,885
A little gift.

1182
01:42:23,554 --> 01:42:25,847
And it's Mr. Crepsley.

1183
01:42:31,229 --> 01:42:34,731
Because you told me to
throw you. Well, l'm sorry.

1184
01:42:36,275 --> 01:42:40,654
You did it, man. Once a
general, always a general.

1185
01:42:41,072 --> 01:42:43,740
l couldn't have
done it better myself.

1186
01:42:43,991 --> 01:42:45,700
At nightfall,
we leave with the boy.

1187
01:42:48,496 --> 01:42:50,247
l suppose we
should tell him.

1188
01:42:51,541 --> 01:42:54,793
No, let's give him one day
to rest. He's earned it.

1189
01:42:57,755 --> 01:43:00,715
Sometimes life does
seem all planned out,

1190
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:02,551
like there's no choice
in the matter,

1191
01:43:03,553 --> 01:43:04,678
but that's an illusion.

1192
01:43:04,762 --> 01:43:06,513
Speakers. Tasty.

1193
01:43:08,349 --> 01:43:10,016
My name's Darren Shan,

1194
01:43:10,101 --> 01:48:59,824
and l don't just live with a
bunch of freaks. I am one, too.

1195
01:49:00,305 --> 01:50:00,288
