2
00:01:24,261 --> 00:01:25,653
What do you see?

3
00:01:26,915 --> 00:01:28,003
Bag.

4
00:01:35,098 --> 00:01:37,578
Geophone.

5
00:01:58,077 --> 00:01:59,992
I don't hear anything.

6
00:02:00,035 --> 00:02:03,169
It's seven days, Berton.
They're dead.

7
00:02:03,213 --> 00:02:04,886
Get the water and the lights
ready. We're going in.

8
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,478
One noise, and the Germans
will blow the secondary charges.

9
00:02:07,521 --> 00:02:09,262
It's a trap.

10
00:02:09,306 --> 00:02:11,090
If there's a chance, we go.

11
00:02:11,134 --> 00:02:13,397
You know that.

12
00:02:15,225 --> 00:02:17,705
Let's get this over with.
Come on.

13
00:02:23,842 --> 00:02:27,150
Go back to the auxiliary tunnel.
Wait for me there.

14
00:02:27,193 --> 00:02:28,194
Get out of here.

15
00:03:29,429 --> 00:03:31,170
Oh, fuck.

16
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,231
Aaah!

17
00:03:48,274 --> 00:03:50,798
Shh.
The Germans are right above us.

18
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:53,932
Shh.

19
00:03:57,109 --> 00:03:59,807
If they hear us,
they'll blow the charges.

20
00:05:09,094 --> 00:05:11,401
Oh. Where in God's name is he?

21
00:05:12,402 --> 00:05:15,187
Bloody war will be over
by the time he gets here.

22
00:05:19,017 --> 00:05:21,062
As you were.

23
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,719
Give General Mackenzie
my apologies.

24
00:05:25,763 --> 00:05:28,287
When I'm done with our friends
from intelligence here,

25
00:05:28,331 --> 00:05:30,071
I'll be along immediately.

26
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:32,596
Gentlemen.

27
00:05:38,428 --> 00:05:41,518
This is the front
as it stood two days ago.

28
00:05:41,561 --> 00:05:43,128
In May of last year,

29
00:05:43,171 --> 00:05:46,653
the Germans began constructing
an underground bunker here,

30
00:05:46,697 --> 00:05:48,481
deep within the Argonne Forest,

31
00:05:48,525 --> 00:05:51,223
almost 11 miles
behind their lines.

32
00:05:51,266 --> 00:05:53,747
These spoil heaps indicate

33
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,576
that they've dug
three to four levels.

34
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,839
They've gone as deep
as a hundred feet, sir.

35
00:05:58,883 --> 00:06:00,319
That doesn't make any sense.

36
00:06:00,363 --> 00:06:03,061
The Germans go underground
to hide from our shells

37
00:06:03,104 --> 00:06:06,238
or to drive tunnels beneath
our lines to plant explosives.

38
00:06:06,281 --> 00:06:08,303
And they wouldn't need to do
either so far from the front,

39
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:09,502
would they, sir?

40
00:06:09,546 --> 00:06:11,504
So, what the devil
are they doing there?

41
00:06:11,548 --> 00:06:13,376
We don't know, but...

42
00:06:14,725 --> 00:06:18,119
our sources
place Reiner at the compound

43
00:06:18,163 --> 00:06:20,644
within the last 48 hours.

44
00:06:20,687 --> 00:06:23,386
Reiner, that little bastard.

45
00:06:23,429 --> 00:06:26,563
What do they call him,
the Prophet?

46
00:06:26,606 --> 00:06:29,130
What do you make of this,
Doctor?

47
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:32,438
Reiner is a menace, sir.

48
00:06:32,482 --> 00:06:35,049
The man has been instrumental
in weaponizing chemicals...

49
00:06:35,093 --> 00:06:37,312
Phosgene, mustard gas.

50
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:39,445
We believe he's also attempted
to weaponize anthrax,

51
00:06:39,489 --> 00:06:42,666
cholera, and the bubonic plague.

52
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:46,452
Beneath Trench 11 could be
the Wotan complex,

53
00:06:46,496 --> 00:06:49,281
rumored to be
Reiner's base of operations.

54
00:06:49,324 --> 00:06:52,284
If he has been
developing something in there,

55
00:06:52,327 --> 00:06:54,199
we must go in and find out what.

56
00:06:54,242 --> 00:06:57,028
Surely any evidence would have
been removed during the retreat.

57
00:06:57,071 --> 00:06:58,203
No, sir.

58
00:06:58,246 --> 00:07:00,640
When the German line fell
two days ago,

59
00:07:00,684 --> 00:07:03,295
they did try to destroy
the base, but they failed.

60
00:07:03,338 --> 00:07:05,210
They left with just
the clothes on their backs.

61
00:07:05,253 --> 00:07:08,518
Whatever they were working on
is still there.

62
00:07:10,215 --> 00:07:12,043
What will you need?

63
00:07:12,086 --> 00:07:13,499
An escort
to get us through the Argonne.

64
00:07:13,523 --> 00:07:15,525
It will have to be American,
I'm afraid.

65
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:19,442
Well, Colonel, surely something
can be arranged.

66
00:07:19,485 --> 00:07:22,314
I mean, the Americans?

67
00:07:22,357 --> 00:07:25,360
The Argonne belongs to them now,
and they paid dearly for it.

68
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:26,536
Colonel...

69
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:29,364
We are about to end this war,
Jennings.

70
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:31,366
Every other soldier
within 200 miles

71
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:34,979
is now gathering near Cambrai
for the final offensive.

72
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:37,198
Anything else, gentlemen?

73
00:07:37,242 --> 00:07:39,331
A tunneler to get us down below.

74
00:07:39,374 --> 00:07:40,593
Given our timeline,

75
00:07:40,637 --> 00:07:42,377
I took the liberty
of checking with brigade.

76
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:43,770
Name's Berton.

77
00:07:44,728 --> 00:07:46,164
Canadian.

78
00:07:46,207 --> 00:07:48,253
What's the medal for?

79
00:07:48,296 --> 00:07:51,909
He tried to save some tunnelers
in the salient in July.

80
00:07:51,952 --> 00:07:53,476
Miracle he survived.

81
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:57,044
12 days underground?

82
00:07:57,088 --> 00:07:58,785
My God.

83
00:08:00,395 --> 00:08:02,373
It says here he's on furlough.
How will you find him?

84
00:08:02,397 --> 00:08:06,401
Well, he's a tunneler on his
first leave in over a year.

85
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:09,317
We've a fairly good idea
where to look.

86
00:08:34,168 --> 00:08:35,779
Veronique.

87
00:08:39,783 --> 00:08:40,827
Oui.

88
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,099
Oui, oui. J'arrive.

89
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:01,108
Everything okay?

90
00:09:06,418 --> 00:09:08,725
I wish you didn't drink as much.

91
00:09:10,335 --> 00:09:12,642
Is that you
or your father talking?

92
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:16,559
Well, your drinking is
the one thing he can relate to.

93
00:09:16,602 --> 00:09:19,779
Well, I guess he would.
He owns a tavern, after all.

94
00:09:19,823 --> 00:09:22,565
He's been drinking a lot more
since I've met you.

95
00:09:22,608 --> 00:09:23,653
Why is that?

96
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:30,050
Maybe because he doesn't like
that a foreigner from far away

97
00:09:30,094 --> 00:09:32,139
has seduced his daughter.

98
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:37,971
I-I didn't seduce you.
You seduced me.

99
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:40,844
Uh-huh. I was drunk.

100
00:09:40,887 --> 00:09:44,630
And... And I put
my arms around you, and...

101
00:09:44,674 --> 00:09:47,807
Yes.
You put your arms around me.

102
00:09:47,851 --> 00:09:50,854
Yeah, I put my arms around you,
and then you kissed me.

103
00:09:57,077 --> 00:09:58,688
Just like that.

104
00:10:06,217 --> 00:10:08,611
Oh, I can't wait for you
to meet my parents.

105
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,657
Your parents?

106
00:10:11,701 --> 00:10:13,659
And you're gonna love Winnipeg.

107
00:10:13,703 --> 00:10:15,269
Why?

108
00:10:15,313 --> 00:10:16,967
Ohh.

109
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,883
It's even more romantic
than Paris.

110
00:10:21,232 --> 00:10:23,756
I can't wait for this war
to be over.

111
00:11:51,104 --> 00:11:55,369
That's the Argonne.
You ever been?

112
00:11:55,413 --> 00:11:57,589
Hell of a place for a picnic.

113
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,374
I suggest we wait here.

114
00:12:00,418 --> 00:12:01,961
Wait till this blows over,
then head in.

115
00:12:01,985 --> 00:12:04,901
Negative. We need to push on.

116
00:12:04,944 --> 00:12:06,772
With all due respect, sir,
we're six men.

117
00:12:06,816 --> 00:12:08,339
We drove
most of them bastards out,

118
00:12:08,382 --> 00:12:10,341
but God knows how many
are still hiding in there,

119
00:12:10,384 --> 00:12:11,821
waiting to cut us down.

120
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:14,519
In this weather, we don't know
what we're walking into.

121
00:12:17,478 --> 00:12:20,264
We wait here and observe.

122
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:23,397
In one hour, we move.

123
00:12:23,441 --> 00:12:24,834
Understood?

124
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,449
Fucking limeys.

125
00:12:31,492 --> 00:12:33,799
Just my luck, I get
the one war in a hundred years

126
00:12:33,843 --> 00:12:35,342
where those pricks
are on our fucking side.

127
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:37,170
- Yeah.
- What's the word on them?

128
00:12:37,194 --> 00:12:39,239
Nothing good.

129
00:12:39,283 --> 00:12:41,546
I heard the major
is real ambitious.

130
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:42,808
Oh, fuck. That's just perfect.

131
00:12:42,852 --> 00:12:44,462
Spent most of the war
riding a desk.

132
00:12:44,505 --> 00:12:45,961
Now he'll do anything
to get a promotion

133
00:12:45,985 --> 00:12:47,770
before the show's over.

134
00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:58,389
Well, what's your professional
opinion of our American escort?

135
00:12:58,432 --> 00:13:02,001
They've been in constant
combat for months on end.

136
00:13:02,045 --> 00:13:05,048
That starts to take its toll.

137
00:13:05,091 --> 00:13:09,879
My advice, sir, would be
not to push them too hard.

138
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:13,839
Hit me, Pronger.

139
00:13:13,883 --> 00:13:16,842
Fuck off, Private. Get your own.

140
00:13:16,886 --> 00:13:19,540
No wonder they've been fighting
over the same fields

141
00:13:19,584 --> 00:13:20,933
for four years.

142
00:13:20,977 --> 00:13:23,544
They're all drunk.
This guy has been at it all day.

143
00:13:23,588 --> 00:13:25,808
He's killed more Germans
than any of us.

144
00:13:25,851 --> 00:13:27,374
More than Pronger?

145
00:13:27,418 --> 00:13:29,222
Okay, nobody's killed more
fucking Germans than Pronger.

146
00:13:29,246 --> 00:13:31,509
Okay, so then who the fuck
is this guy?

147
00:13:31,552 --> 00:13:32,684
A tunneler.

148
00:13:32,727 --> 00:13:34,183
Fuck, I wouldn't mind
being underground

149
00:13:34,207 --> 00:13:35,402
when the war is going on above.

150
00:13:35,426 --> 00:13:36,906
No fucking way.

151
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:38,255
When the lines formed,

152
00:13:38,298 --> 00:13:40,170
Germans started digging
beneath no-man's-land.

153
00:13:40,213 --> 00:13:43,260
Guys like him
are sent underground

154
00:13:43,303 --> 00:13:44,739
to stop the German tunnelers

155
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:47,177
and to plant bombs of their own
under Fritz's line.

156
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,398
Three months ago,
he gets trapped 80 feet down.

157
00:13:51,442 --> 00:13:55,489
Nobody comes for him.
So, what does he do?

158
00:13:55,533 --> 00:13:58,405
That crazy bastard
digs himself out.

159
00:13:58,449 --> 00:13:59,842
By the time he finally gets out,

160
00:13:59,885 --> 00:14:02,018
his family has already
thrown his funeral.

161
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:07,910
Yes, that's it, all right.

162
00:15:07,953 --> 00:15:09,563
Any movement?

163
00:15:09,607 --> 00:15:11,304
Nothing but the rats.

164
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,917
You ever eat rat, Major?

165
00:15:16,005 --> 00:15:17,876
Move in and take a look.

166
00:15:19,008 --> 00:15:23,186
You heard the major.
Pronger, we're up.

167
00:15:32,108 --> 00:15:34,371
What is it they keep chewing?

168
00:15:34,414 --> 00:15:35,763
Seems they live on it.

169
00:15:36,721 --> 00:15:38,810
Forced March, sir.

170
00:15:38,853 --> 00:15:41,291
Cocaine. A stimulant.

171
00:15:41,334 --> 00:15:44,990
Seems they hand it out
with rations these days.

172
00:15:45,034 --> 00:15:47,601
Apparently rather effective.

173
00:15:47,645 --> 00:15:50,300
Let's go. Let's go.

174
00:20:07,209 --> 00:20:08,993
I don't think
we pushed this far.

175
00:20:09,036 --> 00:20:13,040
We didn't.
These are German shells.

176
00:20:13,084 --> 00:20:15,565
Why are they killing
their own guys?

177
00:20:16,392 --> 00:20:19,133
There's something you need
to see, Major.

178
00:20:36,063 --> 00:20:39,284
Two main entrances
were blown in,

179
00:20:39,328 --> 00:20:42,069
but for some reason
this one was spared.

180
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:50,513
And, uh, here...

181
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:55,213
as you can see,
there used to be a ladder.

182
00:20:56,127 --> 00:21:01,001
Whoever got rid of it
did it in a hurry.

183
00:21:01,045 --> 00:21:03,526
You care to tell us
what we're here for?

184
00:21:05,049 --> 00:21:07,138
This is
a reconnaissance mission.

185
00:21:07,181 --> 00:21:10,097
Observe and report.

186
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:29,334
This base is abandoned, so we
don't expect any resistance.

187
00:21:29,378 --> 00:21:32,163
What a shame.

188
00:21:32,206 --> 00:21:33,599
Once we're in, the doctor and I

189
00:21:33,643 --> 00:21:35,645
will collect
any relevant evidence,

190
00:21:35,688 --> 00:21:37,081
and we'll be on our way.

191
00:21:37,124 --> 00:21:39,257
- Simple enough.
- How do we know it's abandoned?

192
00:21:39,301 --> 00:21:41,825
I heard entire divisions got
left behind when the line fell.

193
00:21:41,868 --> 00:21:43,087
Shut it, Kelly.

194
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,456
We don't got the numbers
for a raiding party.

195
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,066
If we run into more than
a couple of these guys,

196
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,265
we're in some serious trou...

197
00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:50,094
This mission was approved
by my superiors.

198
00:21:50,137 --> 00:21:53,053
Risks were assessed
and appropriate measures taken.

199
00:21:53,097 --> 00:21:54,272
We are wasting valuable time.

200
00:21:54,316 --> 00:21:55,795
Captain Cooper.

201
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:57,188
Yes, sir?

202
00:21:57,231 --> 00:21:59,059
Control your men.

203
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,236
Or I will.

204
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,632
- All right, the tunneler...
- Berton, sir.

205
00:22:07,764 --> 00:22:09,940
Will take the lead.

206
00:22:09,983 --> 00:22:12,421
Sausage eater
is a tricky bastard, all right?

207
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:14,423
When he pulls out of
places like this,

208
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:15,815
he likes to leave
little presents

209
00:22:15,859 --> 00:22:18,427
for stupid farm boys
looking for trophies.

210
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,038
So for all our sakes,
don't touch anything

211
00:22:21,081 --> 00:22:23,954
unless I fucking say so.

212
00:22:23,997 --> 00:22:26,739
All right, Berton. Let's go.

213
00:24:16,066 --> 00:24:19,417
Let's move. Cooper, you're up.

214
00:25:34,318 --> 00:25:36,755
I smell the bastard
from six feet...

215
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,148
Quiet!

216
00:25:38,191 --> 00:25:40,454
Sneak up on me.
Smelled like sauerkraut.

217
00:25:42,326 --> 00:25:44,197
Berton, check the door.

218
00:26:03,086 --> 00:26:04,914
- Oh!
- Watch your step, Doc.

219
00:26:04,957 --> 00:26:06,568
Hey, shut up!

220
00:26:12,225 --> 00:26:13,662
He's fucking dead.

221
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:16,447
Shh! Quiet, for God sakes.

222
00:26:34,857 --> 00:26:36,554
It's all quiet.
We're good to go.

223
00:26:36,598 --> 00:26:38,121
Sir.

224
00:26:39,818 --> 00:26:41,907
I think he tried to climb out.

225
00:27:03,189 --> 00:27:04,582
Do you guys speak German?

226
00:27:04,626 --> 00:27:06,453
He's saying,
"Don't open the door."

227
00:27:10,849 --> 00:27:12,459
Okay, what the fuck
is he saying now?

228
00:27:12,503 --> 00:27:13,852
Spit it out, Doc.

229
00:27:13,896 --> 00:27:15,985
He says if we open the door,
we're all gonna die.

230
00:27:18,161 --> 00:27:20,380
Did I tell you to stop?

231
00:27:21,294 --> 00:27:22,774
Come on!

232
00:27:23,949 --> 00:27:25,995
- Nein, nein, nein!
- Shut that idiot up, Captain.

233
00:27:26,038 --> 00:27:28,258
What do you want me to do,
shoot him? He's fucking C3.

234
00:27:28,301 --> 00:27:30,782
Find out if he's got
friends down here.

235
00:27:35,744 --> 00:27:37,069
Maybe we should
listen to him, sir.

236
00:27:37,093 --> 00:27:38,287
We don't know
what's behind that.

237
00:27:38,311 --> 00:27:39,878
Shut up! Come on!

238
00:27:42,141 --> 00:27:43,621
Hey!

239
00:27:43,665 --> 00:27:45,928
Doc, you tell this asshole
if he takes another step,

240
00:27:45,971 --> 00:27:46,842
I will shoot.

241
00:27:46,885 --> 00:27:48,670
Shoot? Shoot, ja. Ja!

242
00:27:48,713 --> 00:27:50,672
- Hey, hey!
- Shoot, ja! Ja! Bitte!

243
00:27:50,715 --> 00:27:51,803
- Shoot, shoot.
- Hey!

244
00:27:51,847 --> 00:27:52,867
Come on. On three.

245
00:27:52,891 --> 00:27:54,066
One, two, three!

246
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,981
You understand what I'm saying?

247
00:27:56,025 --> 00:27:57,200
- Bitte! Bitte!
- Doc?

248
00:27:57,243 --> 00:27:58,505
- Shooting me.
- I swear to God.

249
00:27:58,549 --> 00:28:00,116
He keeps moving, I will shoot.

250
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:01,479
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

251
00:28:01,508 --> 00:28:02,703
- I'm ordering you to get back!
- Bitte.

252
00:28:02,727 --> 00:28:03,728
Hey, Captain...

253
00:28:58,478 --> 00:29:01,743
All right, Berton.
You take the lead.

254
00:30:11,116 --> 00:30:12,814
There's someone in here.

255
00:30:22,171 --> 00:30:24,738
Hold your fire!

256
00:30:24,782 --> 00:30:26,479
Hold your fire.

257
00:30:26,523 --> 00:30:28,525
I can't fucking see anything!

258
00:30:28,568 --> 00:30:30,309
Where is he? Where did he go?

259
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,668
Aah!

260
00:30:42,321 --> 00:30:45,107
Aaagh!

261
00:30:49,938 --> 00:30:51,853
Grenade!

262
00:30:51,896 --> 00:30:53,419
Grenade!

263
00:30:53,463 --> 00:30:54,943
Take cover!

264
00:31:02,646 --> 00:31:03,821
Everybody okay?

265
00:31:03,865 --> 00:31:06,519
- Yeah.
- You okay, Kelly?

266
00:31:06,563 --> 00:31:07,999
Yeah, I'm fine, Captain.

267
00:31:13,657 --> 00:31:17,313
Abandoned, my ass.
Who the fuck was that?

268
00:31:25,538 --> 00:31:26,713
Can it be cleared?

269
00:31:26,757 --> 00:31:28,541
My guess is
the entire tunnel collapsed.

270
00:31:28,585 --> 00:31:29,629
Can it be cleared?

271
00:31:29,673 --> 00:31:30,955
Best we search
for another way out.

272
00:31:30,979 --> 00:31:32,347
Are you saying
we're stuck down here?

273
00:31:32,371 --> 00:31:33,871
This room's
not gonna hold much longer.

274
00:31:33,895 --> 00:31:35,481
- We need to move.
- How are we gonna breathe?

275
00:31:35,505 --> 00:31:36,830
- We're 50 feet deep.
- Shut up, Kelly.

276
00:31:36,854 --> 00:31:37,918
We're gonna fucking suffocate.

277
00:31:37,942 --> 00:31:40,771
Shut up! Save your breath.

278
00:31:40,814 --> 00:31:42,686
Let's go.

279
00:32:01,009 --> 00:32:03,533
We ain't alone down here.

280
00:32:03,576 --> 00:32:05,970
Look sharp.

281
00:32:06,014 --> 00:32:08,407
Watch the corners.

282
00:32:32,736 --> 00:32:35,304
The air is moving.

283
00:32:35,347 --> 00:32:38,481
Fritz left
a door open somewhere.

284
00:32:38,524 --> 00:32:40,352
Yes? And?

285
00:32:41,701 --> 00:32:43,399
We go down.

286
00:33:08,424 --> 00:33:10,992
Sit tight while I scout ahead.

287
00:33:17,259 --> 00:33:19,957
That German back there,
was that shell shock?

288
00:33:20,001 --> 00:33:21,611
Shell shock?

289
00:33:21,654 --> 00:33:24,048
You've really never been on
a battlefield, have you, Major?

290
00:33:24,092 --> 00:33:26,964
That Hun was sick.
He ain't the first one, either.

291
00:33:27,008 --> 00:33:28,724
We've been finding them
all through the Argonne.

292
00:33:28,748 --> 00:33:32,143
There have been reports that the
German line was recently struck

293
00:33:32,187 --> 00:33:34,972
by a particularly lethal form
of influenza.

294
00:33:35,016 --> 00:33:36,191
Is that why we're here?

295
00:33:36,234 --> 00:33:38,367
Maybe that's why
they sealed the base.

296
00:33:39,324 --> 00:33:41,109
That guy just
hacked all over me.

297
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:43,763
This place is a maze.
Best you just come with me.

298
00:33:43,807 --> 00:33:45,287
No.

299
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:47,134
Captain Cooper will escort you.
Help him find an exit.

300
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:49,682
The rest of us will continue
our sweep and meet back here.

301
00:33:49,726 --> 00:33:51,399
Sweep? We've got no idea
how big this place is.

302
00:33:51,423 --> 00:33:53,686
You go sightseeing,
you'll get lost.

303
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:55,360
No, he's right. How are we gonna
get back without him?

304
00:33:55,384 --> 00:33:56,994
We'll lay markers.

305
00:33:57,038 --> 00:34:01,085
Okay, sir, with all respect,
six men are stronger than four.

306
00:34:01,129 --> 00:34:02,434
You are under my direct command.

307
00:34:02,478 --> 00:34:03,878
I'm not asking you.
I'm telling you.

308
00:34:03,914 --> 00:34:06,177
Captain, this is bullshit.

309
00:34:06,221 --> 00:34:07,613
Not my call.

310
00:34:07,657 --> 00:34:09,026
Without that tunneler, sir,
we're dead.

311
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:10,486
Like the major said,

312
00:34:10,529 --> 00:34:11,878
lay markers,
trace your way back.

313
00:34:11,922 --> 00:34:13,141
Yeah, this is crazy, though.

314
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:15,012
Hey! I'll come back for you.

315
00:34:15,056 --> 00:34:16,337
Yeah, and I'm not
dying down here, sir.

316
00:34:16,361 --> 00:34:18,407
Gentlemen!

317
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:20,452
I understand your concerns,

318
00:34:20,496 --> 00:34:23,107
but we have prepared
for this contingency.

319
00:34:23,151 --> 00:34:26,371
As we speak, a team of
Royal Engineers is en route

320
00:34:26,415 --> 00:34:27,981
and will check in on us.

321
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:30,462
If our tunneler
can't find an exit,

322
00:34:30,506 --> 00:34:33,726
and if we fail to check in
by 0900 tomorrow,

323
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:36,120
efforts to extract us
will begin.

324
00:34:36,164 --> 00:34:37,730
Now, in the meantime...

325
00:34:38,688 --> 00:34:41,604
we are here to complete
a vitally important mission,

326
00:34:41,647 --> 00:34:43,475
and, by God, I intend
to see that it's done.

327
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:45,216
Lieutenant Berton,
find that exit

328
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,305
and be back here in three hours.

329
00:34:47,349 --> 00:34:49,133
Yeah. You got three hours.

330
00:34:49,177 --> 00:34:51,483
Three hours to find whatever
it is you came down here for,

331
00:34:51,527 --> 00:34:53,746
but don't expect me to find you
if you're not back.

332
00:34:54,834 --> 00:34:57,098
I expect that you
and every other man in this unit

333
00:34:57,141 --> 00:34:58,229
will do his duty.

334
00:34:58,273 --> 00:34:59,883
Do I make myself clear?

335
00:35:04,975 --> 00:35:06,281
Good luck.

336
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,937
It's a bad idea, Captain.

337
00:35:24,473 --> 00:35:26,170
What kind of place is this?

338
00:35:26,214 --> 00:35:28,216
Some kind of command center?

339
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:30,522
12 miles behind enemy lines?

340
00:35:30,566 --> 00:35:33,003
What about that metal door
we found?

341
00:35:33,046 --> 00:35:36,746
- What about it?
- It locked from the outside.

342
00:35:36,789 --> 00:35:38,487
Place wasn't built
to keep people out.

343
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:41,533
It was built to keep people in.

344
00:35:41,577 --> 00:35:44,145
You think you can
get us out of here?

345
00:35:45,189 --> 00:35:48,975
I mean, you've gotten
out of worse, haven't you?

346
00:35:49,019 --> 00:35:52,153
A place this size should have
two or three emergency shafts.

347
00:35:52,196 --> 00:35:56,026
We find the outside wall,
we'll find a way out.

348
00:36:13,652 --> 00:36:15,219
Pronger, Kelly.

349
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:48,426
What's a hospital
doing down here?

350
00:37:04,834 --> 00:37:07,010
Major, you should see this.

351
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:11,014
- Over there.
- Pronger, stand down.

352
00:37:11,057 --> 00:37:13,234
Doctor, with me.

353
00:38:25,915 --> 00:38:27,482
My fucking light.

354
00:38:33,139 --> 00:38:34,358
Shh.

355
00:38:35,403 --> 00:38:37,709
Damn.

356
00:38:37,753 --> 00:38:39,320
Quiet!

357
00:38:50,896 --> 00:38:52,985
Oh, shit!

358
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:04,780
Let's go. Come on.

359
00:39:14,877 --> 00:39:16,400
Out of the way.

360
00:39:16,444 --> 00:39:17,967
Behind you!

361
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,813
Berton!

362
00:39:43,862 --> 00:39:44,862
Let's go.

363
00:39:52,218 --> 00:39:53,698
Oh, bloody hell.

364
00:39:53,742 --> 00:39:56,222
Reiner's built
an entire city down here.

365
00:39:56,266 --> 00:39:58,573
The Wotan rumors were true.

366
00:40:01,489 --> 00:40:03,708
"Laboratorium." Labs.

367
00:40:03,752 --> 00:40:07,233
You were right.
We have to go down there.

368
00:40:07,277 --> 00:40:08,950
What about the tunneler?
How long has it been?

369
00:40:08,974 --> 00:40:11,673
- Well, he'll have to wait.
- What if he doesn't?

370
00:40:12,848 --> 00:40:15,416
Cooper said
he'd come back for you, yes?

371
00:40:15,459 --> 00:40:16,634
He wouldn't leave us behind.

372
00:40:16,678 --> 00:40:17,872
Then he'll bring Berton
with him.

373
00:40:17,896 --> 00:40:19,463
Focus on the task at hand.

374
00:40:19,507 --> 00:40:22,292
We'll be done before you know it
now that we have the map.

375
00:40:22,335 --> 00:40:24,076
For all we know,
thatcould be a shaft.

376
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,295
Or that.

377
00:40:25,338 --> 00:40:26,707
And what if these exits
are blocked in?

378
00:40:26,731 --> 00:40:28,254
We'll deal with it then!

379
00:41:19,218 --> 00:41:24,267
Scheisse! Scheisse!
Scheisse! Scheisse!

380
00:42:00,912 --> 00:42:03,959
Wait, Doc, Doc, Doc.
Doc, look. His stomach.

381
00:42:33,031 --> 00:42:35,599
I spring a leak, you can start
to worry about me, okay?

382
00:42:39,168 --> 00:42:42,650
This place
is crawling with Germans.

383
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:44,565
You ever see anything like that?

384
00:42:44,608 --> 00:42:48,264
I've seen
some ugly fucking Huns before.

385
00:42:48,307 --> 00:42:49,570
Never quite that ugly.

386
00:42:51,006 --> 00:42:54,487
And I've never seen them
kill each other.

387
00:42:54,531 --> 00:42:57,316
You know something about this
place you're not telling me?

388
00:42:59,014 --> 00:43:02,278
Huh? Jennings tell you anything?

389
00:43:02,321 --> 00:43:03,496
Nothing.

390
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,107
My CO gave me my orders...

391
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:07,283
Get Jennings in and out
without so much of a scratch.

392
00:43:07,326 --> 00:43:10,242
And your CO
didn't tell you anything?

393
00:43:11,156 --> 00:43:13,985
- Didn't know.
- Didn't tell you.

394
00:43:14,029 --> 00:43:15,987
Didn't know.

395
00:43:16,031 --> 00:43:19,861
But whatever
Jennings is doing down here

396
00:43:19,904 --> 00:43:24,387
is important enough
to secure the full cooperation

397
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:26,389
of the American army.

398
00:43:26,432 --> 00:43:27,956
How else could he get

399
00:43:27,999 --> 00:43:29,827
a whole division down here
to help us out?

400
00:43:29,871 --> 00:43:32,438
Let me tell you something else
you don't know.

401
00:43:32,482 --> 00:43:34,702
Nobody is fucking coming for us.

402
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:37,052
Jennings is a fucking liar.

403
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:41,186
What is a scheisse, anyway?

404
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:43,885
You be quiet, please.
Give me some light.

405
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,497
- What are you looking for?
- Answers.

406
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:50,848
If I could see anything.
Light, please.

407
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:05,907
Ugh.

408
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:20,965
Major, open up
this side, please.

409
00:44:26,884 --> 00:44:28,843
Hold the table, you two.

410
00:44:52,693 --> 00:44:53,868
- Oh!
- Oh!

411
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:58,263
Light, please.

412
00:45:23,027 --> 00:45:24,507
What is it?

413
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:27,902
I think it's a type
of Dirofilaria.

414
00:45:27,945 --> 00:45:29,686
American, Doc.

415
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:31,732
Parasitic worm.

416
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,559
Like you would see
in cats or dogs.

417
00:45:33,603 --> 00:45:36,214
A heartworm.

418
00:45:36,258 --> 00:45:40,479
But humans can't contract
these worms.

419
00:45:40,523 --> 00:45:44,701
Not in this quantity or size.

420
00:45:44,745 --> 00:45:46,747
Well, this is truly...

421
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:50,751
extraordinary.

422
00:46:10,118 --> 00:46:11,815
Oh!

423
00:46:26,003 --> 00:46:27,483
They've, uh...

424
00:46:28,614 --> 00:46:31,487
They've occupied
his orbital cavities,

425
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:35,012
the sinuses,
the prefrontal cortex.

426
00:46:35,056 --> 00:46:36,405
What?

427
00:46:36,448 --> 00:46:39,190
Well, the frontal lobe
governs our personalities.

428
00:46:39,234 --> 00:46:42,411
It's how we tell
right from wrong.

429
00:46:42,454 --> 00:46:45,893
The tiniest lesions there
can cause dementia.

430
00:46:47,372 --> 00:46:50,071
This is not
a natural phenomenon.

431
00:46:51,289 --> 00:46:53,509
This disease was engineered.

432
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:15,313
Achtung.

433
00:47:38,206 --> 00:47:41,644
You ever get scared
down here, places like this?

434
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:45,822
They say you're only scared
when you got something to lose.

435
00:47:45,866 --> 00:47:48,694
You got something to lose?

436
00:47:48,738 --> 00:47:50,827
I'm scared all the time.

437
00:47:50,871 --> 00:47:52,960
Yeah. What's her name?

438
00:47:55,876 --> 00:47:57,442
Veronique.

439
00:47:59,314 --> 00:48:01,620
Veronique. That's a nice name.

440
00:48:04,623 --> 00:48:06,321
We're close.

441
00:48:22,163 --> 00:48:24,078
Right. Let's go.

442
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:39,571
I said, "Let's go."

443
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:47,840
I don't think so.

444
00:48:47,884 --> 00:48:51,279
We're gonna find that tunneler,
and then we leave.

445
00:48:55,370 --> 00:48:58,068
All right.
This has gone far enough.

446
00:48:58,112 --> 00:49:00,636
I gave you a direct order!

447
00:49:04,553 --> 00:49:07,991
You're heading down a very
hazardous path, Sergeant.

448
00:49:08,035 --> 00:49:11,821
More hazardous than following
your sorry ass around?

449
00:49:13,518 --> 00:49:15,520
Not one more step.

450
00:49:19,829 --> 00:49:22,136
Drop it.

451
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:34,539
This is mutiny.

452
00:49:37,368 --> 00:49:38,761
You'll hang.

453
00:49:38,804 --> 00:49:41,024
We live long enough
to get out of here,

454
00:49:41,068 --> 00:49:43,113
and we'll worry about that.

455
00:49:47,248 --> 00:49:49,511
Drop your weapon.

456
00:49:49,554 --> 00:49:50,903
I'm warning you!

457
00:49:50,947 --> 00:49:52,122
Gentlemen.

458
00:49:52,166 --> 00:49:54,864
We're on the same side.
Everybody...

459
00:49:54,907 --> 00:49:56,822
Everybody lower
your weapons now.

460
00:49:56,866 --> 00:50:00,391
I ain't dying down here
so this prick can make colonel.

461
00:50:00,435 --> 00:50:03,003
Listen to me.
Listen to me, gentlemen.

462
00:50:04,265 --> 00:50:09,400
Men of the 49th Infantry are
mustering above us right now.

463
00:50:09,444 --> 00:50:11,924
If you drop your weapons,
I will see to it...

464
00:50:11,968 --> 00:50:13,491
Oh, cut the shit, Jennings.

465
00:50:20,063 --> 00:50:21,934
Drop it or I fire!

466
00:50:21,978 --> 00:50:24,372
I'm warning you!

467
00:50:26,504 --> 00:50:28,680
This is your last chance!

468
00:50:53,009 --> 00:50:56,230
Ohh.

469
00:50:58,014 --> 00:50:59,624
Okay.

470
00:51:01,191 --> 00:51:02,801
Let's go back for the others.

471
00:51:02,845 --> 00:51:05,761
Hey, you're in no shape
to go hunting for your men.

472
00:51:05,804 --> 00:51:08,155
I say we send a team to come
back looking for them, okay?

473
00:51:08,198 --> 00:51:09,330
Come on, let's go.

474
00:51:09,373 --> 00:51:11,027
Look, I promised
I would go back for them.

475
00:51:11,071 --> 00:51:14,074
This place is a maze.
We're outnumbered.

476
00:51:14,117 --> 00:51:16,467
We're lucky to be alive.

477
00:51:16,511 --> 00:51:18,228
Even if we make it back
to the meeting point,

478
00:51:18,252 --> 00:51:20,167
there's no guarantee
they'll be there.

479
00:51:22,343 --> 00:51:24,127
Listen, I tested fate
once before.

480
00:51:24,171 --> 00:51:25,607
Yeah, you lived.

481
00:51:28,392 --> 00:51:30,046
I was lucky.

482
00:51:31,917 --> 00:51:34,659
Look, I'm sorry
nobody came back for you.

483
00:51:36,052 --> 00:51:37,575
But if there's a chance...

484
00:51:39,186 --> 00:51:40,839
we go.

485
00:54:25,787 --> 00:54:28,093
You are men of action,
so I will be brief.

486
00:54:28,137 --> 00:54:29,834
We have come to
destroy the compound,

487
00:54:29,878 --> 00:54:31,358
and we need your tunneler.

488
00:54:31,401 --> 00:54:34,143
Cooperate, and your lives
will be spared.

489
00:54:34,186 --> 00:54:35,362
No.

490
00:54:35,405 --> 00:54:36,972
Until we know what
spreads this disease,

491
00:54:37,015 --> 00:54:38,775
no attempt should be made
to leave this base.

492
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:42,020
If you wish to be in
this place when it is destroyed,

493
00:54:42,064 --> 00:54:43,283
you may be my guest.

494
00:54:43,326 --> 00:54:45,110
Does he speak for all of you?

495
00:54:47,069 --> 00:54:48,070
Good.

496
00:54:48,113 --> 00:54:50,986
Then who among you
is the tunneler?

497
00:55:04,391 --> 00:55:06,349
I'm the tunneler.

498
00:55:06,393 --> 00:55:08,220
You?

499
00:55:14,401 --> 00:55:17,055
You're very tall for a tunneler.

500
00:55:18,187 --> 00:55:19,884
That's what my mother said.

501
00:55:19,928 --> 00:55:23,758
Oh, yeah. Yes.

502
00:55:23,801 --> 00:55:26,108
All right, the rest of you
will assist him.

503
00:55:26,151 --> 00:55:27,346
Berton, nobody should leave here

504
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:29,067
until we get some
bloody answers.

505
00:55:29,111 --> 00:55:32,375
Fine.
You may remain here under guard.

506
00:55:32,419 --> 00:55:36,640
Gentlemen, this base
has been sealed for a reason.

507
00:55:36,684 --> 00:55:38,575
There has been an outbreak here
the likes of which

508
00:55:38,599 --> 00:55:41,602
I've never seen
in my years of medicine.

509
00:55:41,645 --> 00:55:44,648
And you can't stop it, can you?

510
00:55:44,692 --> 00:55:46,389
Can you?

511
00:56:01,883 --> 00:56:04,842
- Come.
- Danke schoen.

512
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,584
Follow me.

513
00:56:28,257 --> 00:56:29,824
We're going to descend
two levels

514
00:56:29,867 --> 00:56:32,783
to where the main charge
failed to detonate.

515
00:56:32,827 --> 00:56:35,612
The tunneler will fix them.

516
00:56:35,656 --> 00:56:38,702
Any explosives that need to be
carried, you will help him.

517
00:56:38,746 --> 00:56:40,071
How are we supposed
to defend ourselves

518
00:56:40,095 --> 00:56:42,402
if we run into
any more of your pals?

519
00:56:42,445 --> 00:56:46,014
You do your job,
and I will see to your safety.

520
00:56:46,057 --> 00:56:47,450
Come.

521
00:57:27,447 --> 00:57:28,796
Mmm.

522
00:57:28,839 --> 00:57:32,060
There's so much joy
in the food the French make.

523
00:57:32,103 --> 00:57:36,368
They are a disgrace
on the battlefield,

524
00:57:36,412 --> 00:57:38,153
but they certainly
have their talents.

525
00:57:45,116 --> 00:57:46,509
Ahh.

526
00:57:48,206 --> 00:57:50,948
Do you know how much joy
is in German food?

527
00:58:01,568 --> 00:58:04,832
It has been quite the week
for the democracies, no?

528
00:58:04,875 --> 00:58:09,010
The Hindenburg Line smashed.
The Fritz on the run.

529
00:58:09,053 --> 00:58:10,968
How exciting.

530
00:58:11,012 --> 00:58:13,580
But I'm wondering
what you will do next.

531
00:58:13,623 --> 00:58:17,018
Consolidate your gains
in the Argonne,

532
00:58:17,061 --> 00:58:20,412
or exploit your breakthrough
at Cambrai?

533
00:58:21,413 --> 00:58:23,067
I vote for Cambrai.

534
00:58:26,418 --> 00:58:29,770
The mustering point
of the next Allied attack.

535
00:58:29,813 --> 00:58:32,163
What about it?

536
00:58:33,774 --> 00:58:35,210
Where is it?

537
00:58:35,253 --> 00:58:37,691
Well, I'm a doctor.

538
00:58:37,734 --> 00:58:40,563
You're asking the wrong man.

539
00:58:40,607 --> 00:58:42,652
You...

540
00:58:42,696 --> 00:58:44,654
You are obviously
a medical officer

541
00:58:44,698 --> 00:58:46,961
attached to
British intelligence.

542
00:58:48,179 --> 00:58:49,964
Where is it?

543
00:58:50,007 --> 00:58:52,967
I couldn't tell you,
Herr Reiner.

544
00:58:57,406 --> 00:58:58,538
Johann.

545
00:59:06,807 --> 00:59:09,026
Let's forget...

546
00:59:10,114 --> 00:59:13,770
for a moment
that we are enemies.

547
00:59:16,991 --> 00:59:22,344
After all, we are friends
in science, aren't we?

548
00:59:25,477 --> 00:59:29,743
So, what did you find

549
00:59:29,786 --> 00:59:32,354
on your little expedition?

550
00:59:32,615 --> 00:59:35,618
That you and I don't practice
the same science.

551
00:59:35,662 --> 00:59:38,621
Of course we do.

552
00:59:38,665 --> 00:59:43,495
When a person falls ill,
do you heal them with words,

553
00:59:43,539 --> 00:59:45,672
or do you cut them open
and rearrange their insides?

554
00:59:45,715 --> 00:59:48,109
- I do what I have to do.
- Exactly.

555
00:59:48,152 --> 00:59:50,198
This is the only criterion

556
00:59:50,241 --> 00:59:52,156
under which
science should be judged...

557
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,855
Its effectiveness.

558
00:59:54,898 --> 00:59:56,334
You think...

559
00:59:56,378 --> 00:59:59,337
You think cutting a man open
with a scalpel

560
00:59:59,381 --> 01:00:01,688
is not an act of aggression?

561
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:06,910
Because to fix him, you have
to inflict a violence upon him.

562
01:00:06,954 --> 01:00:09,609
An educated violence.

563
01:00:09,652 --> 01:00:11,915
A violence
you went to school for.

564
01:00:14,657 --> 01:00:19,357
And what you're doing here
has nothing to do with science.

565
01:00:19,401 --> 01:00:21,403
It's a perversion...

566
01:00:23,361 --> 01:00:24,798
Now, we know that
you've engineered

567
01:00:24,841 --> 01:00:26,582
some sort of parasite,

568
01:00:26,626 --> 01:00:30,020
presumably designed to devastate
Allied livestock.

569
01:00:30,064 --> 01:00:32,544
So I think that you've had
a little accident,

570
01:00:32,588 --> 01:00:35,069
and your strain
has jumped species,

571
01:00:35,112 --> 01:00:38,028
and you've tried to seal
this base to stop it spreading.

572
01:00:41,379 --> 01:00:45,079
No one was more surprised
than myself once it jumped.

573
01:00:45,732 --> 01:00:50,867
But I started breeding a more
virulent strain of the parasite,

574
01:00:50,911 --> 01:00:54,088
and within months
I had created one

575
01:00:54,131 --> 01:00:57,700
that could overwhelm its host
in a matter of hours.

576
01:00:57,744 --> 01:00:59,571
Even before it migrates
to the brain,

577
01:00:59,615 --> 01:01:01,573
the fever caused
by the infestation

578
01:01:01,617 --> 01:01:04,359
can radically alter
the personality.

579
01:01:04,402 --> 01:01:07,971
But once it reaches
the cerebral tissue,

580
01:01:08,015 --> 01:01:13,934
the results are,
well, spectacular.

581
01:01:16,458 --> 01:01:20,418
Some like to fornicate.

582
01:01:20,462 --> 01:01:23,073
Others drink.

583
01:01:23,117 --> 01:01:24,814
But most...

584
01:01:25,772 --> 01:01:27,730
they just want to kill.

585
01:01:35,042 --> 01:01:37,697
Quite liberating,
I should think, no?

586
01:01:50,405 --> 01:01:53,669
Let's go.
It's time to get moving.

587
01:01:53,713 --> 01:01:55,279
Let's go.
We don't have time for this!

588
01:01:55,323 --> 01:01:56,716
Hey, easy, Fritz.

589
01:01:56,759 --> 01:01:58,892
You know, I'm pretty good
with those maps.

590
01:01:58,935 --> 01:02:00,502
Kelly, hey.

591
01:02:00,545 --> 01:02:03,244
I can help you find your way.
You got to show me the map.

592
01:02:03,287 --> 01:02:04,767
Got to move, okay?

593
01:02:04,811 --> 01:02:07,552
Come on. Kelly? Kelly?

594
01:02:08,466 --> 01:02:09,466
Aah!

595
01:02:11,382 --> 01:02:14,951
Aah! No! No! Oh!

596
01:02:14,995 --> 01:02:16,213
No! My nose!

597
01:02:16,257 --> 01:02:18,738
Aah!

598
01:02:42,849 --> 01:02:44,676
- Give me the map.
- No.

599
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:47,592
Don't make me shoot you.
Give me the map.

600
01:02:47,636 --> 01:02:51,335
You're the only who knows
how the wire the explosives.

601
01:02:51,379 --> 01:02:54,338
This is an outbreak,
and we can't control it.

602
01:02:54,382 --> 01:02:56,645
Look at your friends.

603
01:02:56,688 --> 01:02:57,951
Look at them.

604
01:03:00,214 --> 01:03:01,432
Germany has lost the war,

605
01:03:01,476 --> 01:03:04,958
but there will be no peace
if this gets out.

606
01:03:05,001 --> 01:03:07,961
Don't do this for me.

607
01:03:08,004 --> 01:03:10,964
Think of the lives you can save.

608
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:34,770
Thank you.

609
01:03:34,814 --> 01:03:38,078
Like you said,
I'm not doing this for you.

610
01:03:38,121 --> 01:03:39,862
Which way?

611
01:03:41,124 --> 01:03:43,431
Down and to the left.

612
01:03:50,481 --> 01:03:52,396
You think
an outbreak in our lines

613
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:54,050
would allow you
to counterattack?

614
01:03:54,094 --> 01:03:57,184
This awful war is finished.
It's over.

615
01:03:57,227 --> 01:04:00,056
Think about
the civilian casualties.

616
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:02,189
And what about your blockade?

617
01:04:02,232 --> 01:04:06,280
This euphemism for
the premeditated starvation

618
01:04:06,323 --> 01:04:07,890
of thousands of innocent lives?

619
01:04:07,934 --> 01:04:11,676
You, sir, are in no position
to lecture me about morality.

620
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:14,418
Agreed. Then think about
your own people.

621
01:04:14,462 --> 01:04:16,420
This monstrosity
won't recognize any flag.

622
01:04:16,464 --> 01:04:17,813
So be it.

623
01:04:17,857 --> 01:04:22,078
Consider it a radical surgery
to save the host.

624
01:04:22,122 --> 01:04:23,819
If Germany loses this war,

625
01:04:23,863 --> 01:04:26,996
it will fall to the democrats
or the communists...

626
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:28,780
The herd or the Jews...

627
01:04:28,824 --> 01:04:32,306
And I will not allow
either to happen.

628
01:04:32,349 --> 01:04:34,264
So you're gonna drag it
all down with you,

629
01:04:34,308 --> 01:04:37,441
hmm, like some petulant demigod

630
01:04:37,485 --> 01:04:39,617
in one of your
fucking Wagner operas?

631
01:04:40,575 --> 01:04:44,535
Perhaps I will drag it down.
And why not?!

632
01:04:44,579 --> 01:04:49,714
Europe is a perfumed corpse
waiting to be set ablaze.

633
01:04:50,759 --> 01:04:53,762
And if Germany is strong enough,
brave enough,

634
01:04:53,805 --> 01:04:56,373
then it will emerge purified

635
01:04:56,417 --> 01:04:59,115
while the rest of
this dung heap burns!

636
01:04:59,159 --> 01:05:02,031
And if it perish, so be it.

637
01:05:02,075 --> 01:05:04,164
It wasn't up to the task.

638
01:05:11,171 --> 01:05:12,694
The mustering point.

639
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:02,396
- Gramophone?
- Of course.

640
01:06:02,439 --> 01:06:03,832
Huh!

641
01:06:03,875 --> 01:06:05,877
My God.

642
01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:10,795
What did you think
I was going to do?

643
01:06:13,755 --> 01:06:16,279
I rather thought you were
going to torture me.

644
01:06:16,323 --> 01:06:18,673
But I am.

645
01:06:22,372 --> 01:06:23,634
When the line broke,

646
01:06:23,678 --> 01:06:25,593
the order was given
to destroy this compound.

647
01:06:25,636 --> 01:06:27,377
They were able to
contain the infected,

648
01:06:27,421 --> 01:06:30,554
but this main charge never went.

649
01:06:30,598 --> 01:06:32,208
How do I know I'm not infected?

650
01:06:32,252 --> 01:06:35,037
We were told it only transmits
through bodily fluids,

651
01:06:35,081 --> 01:06:36,517
through blood, through saliva.

652
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:39,041
- Well, what are the symptoms?
- Begins with a fever.

653
01:06:39,085 --> 01:06:42,610
You become increasingly violent.
How do youfeel?

654
01:06:42,653 --> 01:06:45,787
I feel like
blowing something up.

655
01:06:45,830 --> 01:06:48,050
That is a symptom.

656
01:06:53,621 --> 01:06:55,405
Can you salvage the explosives?

657
01:06:55,449 --> 01:06:59,627
Oh, the explosives are fine.
Detonators are fine.

658
01:06:59,670 --> 01:07:01,237
Then what's the problem?

659
01:07:01,281 --> 01:07:03,631
They weren't connected.

660
01:07:03,674 --> 01:07:06,721
Somebody wasn't ready
to say goodbye.

661
01:07:58,642 --> 01:08:01,210
I found more det cord.

662
01:08:01,254 --> 01:08:03,299
How much longer?

663
01:08:03,343 --> 01:08:04,692
Finish wiring the explosives,

664
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:06,607
bring it up to the charges
on the second floor,

665
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:08,043
then up to the surface.

666
01:08:08,087 --> 01:08:09,827
Good.

667
01:08:16,573 --> 01:08:19,228
I found these in the guard room.

668
01:08:22,710 --> 01:08:25,016
Thank you.

669
01:08:29,456 --> 01:08:30,587
Prost.

670
01:08:32,111 --> 01:08:33,808
- Prost.
- Prost.

671
01:08:33,851 --> 01:08:36,854
Prost.Cheers.

672
01:08:36,898 --> 01:08:38,204
Cheers.

673
01:08:43,034 --> 01:08:45,211
German beer. You like?

674
01:08:46,690 --> 01:08:48,562
I like.

675
01:08:48,605 --> 01:08:51,782
To the end of the war.

676
01:08:51,826 --> 01:08:53,132
I'll drink to that.

677
01:09:03,881 --> 01:09:08,190
You know, they say that
this disease drives men insane.

678
01:09:08,234 --> 01:09:11,889
But I believe
after the last four years,

679
01:09:11,933 --> 01:09:14,327
both sides
have already been infected.

680
01:09:17,199 --> 01:09:19,201
I was on the Somme,

681
01:09:19,245 --> 01:09:23,553
and we were shelled
for seven days straight.

682
01:09:23,597 --> 01:09:27,905
Even deep down in the dugout,
the sound was deafening.

683
01:09:28,863 --> 01:09:33,868
After 72 hours, some of the men
began to kill themselves.

684
01:09:33,911 --> 01:09:36,392
One of my men...

685
01:09:38,089 --> 01:09:41,397
put a grenade in his mouth,

686
01:09:41,441 --> 01:09:45,967
and I spent the next day
picking his teeth out of my arm,

687
01:09:47,969 --> 01:09:52,408
And after five days,
I crawled up to the top,

688
01:09:52,452 --> 01:09:54,149
out of the dugout...

689
01:09:55,237 --> 01:09:57,631
and I think I wanted to die.

690
01:09:59,807 --> 01:10:04,333
And there I watched
the fields rise and fall,

691
01:10:04,377 --> 01:10:10,121
remade and destroyed again
with each new salvo.

692
01:10:11,297 --> 01:10:12,602
And for what?

693
01:10:15,301 --> 01:10:20,654
To kill a handful of Germans
cowering in a little hole?

694
01:10:20,697 --> 01:10:22,699
Yeah, well, maybe...

695
01:10:24,266 --> 01:10:27,791
Maybe after what
both sides have done,

696
01:10:27,835 --> 01:10:30,272
we all deserve to be wiped out.

697
01:10:35,625 --> 01:10:37,453
Just not today.

698
01:10:42,066 --> 01:10:44,504
Not today.

699
01:11:06,482 --> 01:11:08,484
Gas! Gas!

700
01:11:22,324 --> 01:11:24,283
Come! Down this way!

701
01:11:27,373 --> 01:11:28,548
Up!

702
01:12:09,937 --> 01:12:11,591
Okay.
Let's go through this again.

703
01:12:11,634 --> 01:12:12,896
Which way did you enter?

704
01:12:12,940 --> 01:12:14,985
We came down here
through the emergency exit.

705
01:12:15,029 --> 01:12:16,659
That's going to
be filled with gas

706
01:12:16,683 --> 01:12:20,382
just like the other exits,
so that's not gonna work either.

707
01:12:22,341 --> 01:12:24,212
There.

708
01:12:24,255 --> 01:12:25,822
Thank God
for German engineering.

709
01:12:25,866 --> 01:12:28,259
- What is that?
- It's an auxiliary shaft.

710
01:12:28,303 --> 01:12:31,262
They use it to bring mining cars
up they've filled with spoils,

711
01:12:31,306 --> 01:12:33,656
keep the main tunnels clear
when they're digging.

712
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:35,354
That will take us up
to the next level.

713
01:12:35,397 --> 01:12:37,356
Yeah, but what about
the explosives?

714
01:12:37,399 --> 01:12:40,054
How do we detonate?

715
01:12:40,097 --> 01:12:42,056
- What's that? Sleeping quarters?
- Yeah.

716
01:12:42,099 --> 01:12:45,755
Personal belongings.
Let me go through them.

717
01:12:53,459 --> 01:12:55,199
In case they stop us,

718
01:12:55,243 --> 01:12:57,288
I'm setting the detonation
from here.

719
01:12:57,332 --> 01:12:58,507
How much time will we have?

720
01:12:58,551 --> 01:13:01,771
I'm giving us 45 minutes.

721
01:13:01,815 --> 01:13:03,991
But this is not gonna be enough
to finish the job.

722
01:13:04,034 --> 01:13:06,733
We got to run the det cord
up to the next level.

723
01:13:06,776 --> 01:13:09,997
Whatever survives the blast
will be engulfed in flames.

724
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:12,260
At least the labs
will be destroyed.

725
01:13:12,303 --> 01:13:14,305
Let this be the last.

726
01:13:14,349 --> 01:13:15,872
- Your back!
- Aah!

727
01:13:24,751 --> 01:13:27,101
Oh!

728
01:14:01,918 --> 01:14:03,746
Can you fix this?

729
01:14:05,922 --> 01:14:07,968
I'll rig something else up.

730
01:14:09,709 --> 01:14:11,798
Yeah?

731
01:14:11,841 --> 01:14:14,148
And how about my leg?

732
01:14:17,673 --> 01:14:20,328
Well, you're not gonna waltz
for a while, but you'll live.

733
01:14:22,548 --> 01:14:25,420
Just show me how to do it.

734
01:14:26,987 --> 01:14:28,597
Show you how to do what?

735
01:14:32,253 --> 01:14:34,734
You and I both know
what needs to happen.

736
01:14:38,433 --> 01:14:40,914
Just show me.

737
01:14:48,574 --> 01:14:52,186
You bring the two together.
Electricity will do the rest.

738
01:14:53,056 --> 01:14:54,493
Just touch them?

739
01:14:56,582 --> 01:14:58,671
And how much time do you need?

740
01:15:00,803 --> 01:15:03,327
I need 20 minutes
to make it to the next level,

741
01:15:03,371 --> 01:15:06,461
five minutes
to rig the explosives.

742
01:15:06,505 --> 01:15:08,724
30 minutes to be sure.

743
01:15:15,949 --> 01:15:17,864
I give you till 7:00.

744
01:19:12,228 --> 01:19:13,664
Aah!

745
01:19:23,413 --> 01:19:27,113
Good God.
One of those colonials.

746
01:19:27,156 --> 01:19:31,204
What are you even doing here?
This is not your war.

747
01:19:35,338 --> 01:19:38,254
Aaah!

748
01:19:42,911 --> 01:19:43,956
On your knees.

749
01:19:45,435 --> 01:19:46,523
On your knees!

750
01:19:52,921 --> 01:19:56,533
And now raise your hands.

751
01:19:57,665 --> 01:19:59,710
Put your hands up!

752
01:20:00,799 --> 01:20:01,974
Yeah.

753
01:20:08,371 --> 01:20:11,244
Aaah!

754
01:20:46,105 --> 01:20:48,411
You stupid Canadian.

755
01:20:49,935 --> 01:20:53,547
You are going to die
underneath a French field

756
01:20:53,590 --> 01:20:57,943
thousands of miles from home,

757
01:20:57,986 --> 01:20:59,205
and you're smiling.

758
01:21:00,554 --> 01:21:03,252
Why are you smiling?

759
01:21:03,296 --> 01:21:06,125
I know they call you
the Prophet, but...

760
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:08,954
I know something you don't.

761
01:21:10,390 --> 01:21:12,131
What might that be?

762
01:21:14,176 --> 01:21:16,048
I know how this ends.

762
01:21:17,305 --> 01:22:17,299
