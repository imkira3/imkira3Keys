moment of the trip was the 4 sharks.

NEMO: Wait, I thought there were 3 sharks.

127

there were definitely four.

128
00:08:03,568 --> 00:08:04,988
But last time you told it,
there were three.

129
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,572
Son, which one of us travelled
across the entire ocean?

130
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:09,278
- Nemo did.
- (YELPS)

131
00:08:09,365 --> 00:08:11,075
Obviously we had to cross the ocean...

00:08:11,242 --> 00:08:13,162
to find him, so you know... He went first.

133

I guess that's true. Isn't it?

134
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:23,964
Well, you made it!
You almost missed the field trip.

00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,590
A field trip? Ooh, I love field trips.
Where are we going?

- I did tell her!

- Uh... Dory.
- Yeah.

to keep an eye on today.

Uh-huh.

you weren't exactly with the class.

Oh. Why not?

Well, you know, you have problems
remembering things sometimes.

143
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:49,196
That's the one thing I can remember. Yes.

144
00:08:49,322 --> 00:08:53,332
Okay. And sometimes it's not your fault,
but it can cause you to wander.

145
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:57,499
And Mr Ray doesn't really have time
to worry about fish who wander.

In other words,
he doesn't have enough help.

00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:59,689
Oh, no. I'm sorry. I...
I suffer from short-term memory loss.

458
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:02,113
You don't remember
what we were talking about?

459
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:04,903
Mm-mm. Not a clue.
What were we talking about?

460
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:07,858
Um, you were about to give me your tag.

461
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:10,161
Well, I kind of like my tag.
Why do you want it?

462
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:11,203
So I can go to...

463
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:14,329
So I can go to Cleveland.

464
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:16,834
Cleveland? Mmm. I hear good things
about Cleveland. Why do you want to go?

465
00:24:16,957 --> 00:24:19,167
Because if I stay here I'm gonna get
released back to the ocean.

466
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:21,504
And I have extremely
unpleasant memories of that place.

I just want to live in a glass box alone.

469
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:28,053
That's all I want. So give me your tag!

00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:42,896
I don't work here.
It's not like I have a map of this place.

475
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:44,276
(GASPS) A map! Good idea.

476
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:47,492
You take me to the map, I figure out
where my parents are. Oh, boy.

477
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:52,116
All right. If I get you to your family
will you give me...

478
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:55,872
I don't have much. Um, I...
How about if I give you this tag?

479
00:24:56,955 --> 00:24:58,365
Great idea.

sure that's what I said?

That's what you do best."

00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:10,759
- Yeah, Dad.
- I said that?

484
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:12,717
You said that, Dory swam to the surface,

485
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:14,104
and she got taken by some...

All right, I don't want to hear
the whole story again.

487
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:18,767
I was just asking about the one part
because, look, if I said that...

488
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:22,765
I'm not positive I did.
It's actually a compliment because...

489
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:25,939
I asked her to wait and I said,
"It's what you do best."

00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:29,109
So I... Oh, it's my fault!

00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:33,119
It's all my fault she got kidnapped
and taken into whatever this place is.

- It's a fish hospital.

have purple shells in them.

has been here a very long time.

609

She's a whale shark. Her name is Destiny.

610
00:30:50,892 --> 00:30:52,142
Destiny? Really?

611
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:55,308
You'll notice she's extremely
near-sighted and has trouble...

612
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,730
navigating her environment.
Oh! And here she comes now.

613
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:03,359
Ooh! Destiny. (GASPS) You're a fish?

Wait. What?

616
00:31:06,824 --> 00:31:09,834
- Hi! Hello there.
- Whoa! Oh. Whoa.

617
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:12,957
All right, I'll go with you.

618
00:31:13,831 --> 00:31:17,291
- Excuse me.
- Is that blue blob talking?

619
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:19,798
- Can you help me? I lost my family.
- You lost your family?

620
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:21,212
Well, it's a long story,

621
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:23,007
and truth be told,
I don't remember most of it.

622
00:31:23,132 --> 00:31:24,722
Aw, that is so sad.
You poor thi... (SCREAMS)

(DESTINY PANTING)

624
00:31:28,137 --> 00:31:31,467
Sorry. Not a great swimmer.
I can't see very well.

625
00:31:31,641 --> 00:31:33,061
Oh, I think you swim beautifully.

626
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:35,142
In fact, I've never seen a fish
swim like that before.

627
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:37,021
(VOCALISING) Thank you.

628
00:31:37,146 --> 00:31:39,646
(VOCALISING) You're welcome.

629
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:40,936
Wait. Say that again.

630
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:43,987
Um, you're (VOCALISING) welcome.

631
00:31:44,153 --> 00:31:45,663
- Dory?
- Yes.

632
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:46,822
- Dory?
- Yes.

633
00:31:46,948 --> 00:31:47,908
- Dory?
- Yes.

634
00:31:48,032 --> 00:31:49,622
- (GASPS) Dory!
- Yes.

635
00:31:49,742 --> 00:31:51,912
- You and I were friends!
- No!

636
00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:53,996
- Dory, it's me! Destiny!
- You know me?

637
00:31:54,163 --> 00:31:56,833
Of course! We talked through the pipes
when we were little.

638
00:31:56,999 --> 00:31:58,629
- We were pipe pals!
- We were?

639
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:02,050
- (GASPS) Aw, you're so pretty.
- So you know where I'm from?

640
00:32:02,213 --> 00:32:04,093
Yep, you are from the Open Ocean exhibit.

641
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,010
I'm from the Open Ocean exhibit?

642
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:07,755
(GASPS) Then that's where my parents are.

643
00:32:07,844 --> 00:32:09,104
We got to go. Can you take me there?

644
00:32:09,262 --> 00:32:11,932
Uh... Kind of tough for a whale
to travel around here.

645
00:32:12,098 --> 00:32:15,388
Can you please keep it down
over there? My head hurts.

646
00:32:15,476 --> 00:32:16,476
- (DESTINY GROANS)
- Who's that?

647
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:17,601
(WHISPERING) That's my neighbour, Bailey.

648
00:32:17,687 --> 00:32:19,017
He was brought in with a head injury.

649
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:20,268
I know you're talking about me, Destiny.

650
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:22,569
He thinks he can't use his echolocation,
but I've overheard...

651
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:24,783
the doctors talking.
There's not a thing wrong with him.

652
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:26,864
Hear every word you're saying about me.

653
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:28,028
What's echolocation?

654
00:32:28,197 --> 00:32:31,117
Bailey's head is supposed to put out
a call and the echo helps him...

655
00:32:31,284 --> 00:32:36,334
find objects far away.
Oh, but apparently he's still "healing."

656
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,285
Now I know you're talking about me.

657
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:40,214
- I really can't echolocate.
- Oh.

658
00:32:40,376 --> 00:32:42,086
I cannot have this conversation again.
I just can't.

659
00:32:42,253 --> 00:32:45,303
I hit my head very hard out there.
See how swollen it is!

660
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,764
Your head is supposed to be big!
You're a beluga!

661
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:49,675
Echolocation.

662
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,310
Oh, like the world's
most powerful pair of glasses?

663
00:32:52,388 --> 00:32:53,558
- What?
- What are glasses?

664
00:32:53,681 --> 00:32:55,471
It's sort of like you go, "hoo"

665
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:58,348
and then you see things.
Why do I know that?

666
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,897
Oh. That's interesting.

667
00:33:03,566 --> 00:33:06,276
There you are!
Listen up, you and I are square.

668
00:33:06,444 --> 00:33:08,954
I took you to the map,
now give me that tag!

669
00:33:09,113 --> 00:33:11,163
Wait, no. I know where my parents are.
They're in the...

670
00:33:11,324 --> 00:33:14,164
What's it called? The place...
The soap and lotion?

671
00:33:14,327 --> 00:33:15,997
- BOTH: Open Ocean.
- Open Ocean!

672
00:33:16,162 --> 00:33:18,622
(GASPS) Open Ocean! I know where that is.

673
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:21,919
That's the exhibit located right next to...
I don't care.

674
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:22,924
- Easy!
- (DESTINY GASPS)

675
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:25,922
If you're trying to get to the Open Ocean
exhibit go through the pipes.

676
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:28,298
- HANK: Through the pipes. Great.
- Through the pipes?

677
00:33:28,466 --> 00:33:30,466
Yep. Take two lefts, swim straight
and you'll hit it.

678
00:33:30,635 --> 00:33:34,715
Oh, that's a lot of directions. That's...
Did you get that, Hank? All that?

679
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:36,767
- Uh, yeah.
- Great! Let's go.

680
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:40,346
I'm not going with you. I won't fit.
You have to go by yourself.

681
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,020
Um...

682
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:49,146
That's... I'm... I... See, I can't because
I'm not so good with directions.

683
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,370
Well, that's too bad. A deal's a deal.
You wanted to find your parents?

684
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,491
That's how you get to them.
Now give me your tag.

685
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:57,499
But, Hank, I can't go in the pipes alone.
I'll forget where I'm going.

686
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,540
- Not my problem. Tag!
- But I can't get in that way.

687
00:34:00,665 --> 00:34:03,665
- I'm sorry, but there's no other way.

690
00:34:09,131 --> 00:34:13,181
It's okay. Not everything in life is
easy to do. Isn't that right, Charlie?

691
00:34:13,344 --> 00:34:17,474
She's right. When something's
too hard, you should just give up.

- Charlie!
- A joke. I'm kidding!

693

Just a joke. A joke.
Caution, joker at work.

(GASPS) Nope. My father said
there's always another way.

- What? There is no other way.
- Open Ocean. Open Ocean. Hmm...

700
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:44,083
Open Ocean. I'm pretty sure
it's the building over there.

701
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:47,416
That's ill-defined and roundish.
Like Bailey's head.

00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:49,546
- Wait, what?
- Always another way. There's...

There! Guys, follow me.

Yep. The blue tangs are getting
their own exhibit in Cleveland.

Do you think my parents
will want to see me?

Because... I lost them?

1204

Dory, your parents are going to be
overjoyed to see you.

They're going to have missed...
everything about you.

1206
00:59:13,801 --> 00:59:16,141
- Really?
- Do you know how we found you?

1207
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:18,143
- Something about a clam? Or...
- No.

- No, an oyster.
- No.

- No clam.

We were having a very hard time
until Nemo thought...

you've shown me how to do...

stuff I never dreamed of doing.

And finding my son.
You made all that happen.

Unless I forgot.

No, you didn't forget. I never told you.

And I'm sorry about that.

But, Dory, because of who you are,
you are about to find your parents.

01:09:36,965 --> 01:09:39,925
But I thought you were gone.
How did you...

1367
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:43,060
We went into quarantine
to look for you, but you weren't there.

1368
01:09:43,221 --> 01:09:46,221
And we knew you must have
gotten out through the pipes.

1369
01:09:46,391 --> 01:09:48,601
Through the pipes. That's right, sweetie.
And so we did too.

1370
01:09:48,769 --> 01:09:52,609
And we've stayed in this spot for you
ever since.

1371
01:09:52,773 --> 01:09:55,113
- We thought you might come back.
- We stayed and waited for you.

1372
01:09:55,275 --> 01:09:58,275
So every day, we go out and lay out...

1373
01:09:59,237 --> 01:10:00,317
Shells.

1374
01:10:05,786 --> 01:10:10,616
And you found us. Oh, honey, you found us.

1375
01:10:10,791 --> 01:10:13,291
And you know why you found us?
Because you remembered.

1376
01:10:14,836 --> 01:10:19,756
You remembered
in your own, amazing, Dory way.

I did. All by myself.

Oh, honey. Really? Have you been
by yourself all these years?

01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:32,647
Oh, my poor little girl.

- ALL: No. Sorry. I didn't see anything.

Seriously? That's a lot
of eyeballs doing nothing.

1384

Oh! Oh, excuse me. Can you help us?

Oh, thank goodness. See, Nemo,
I knew she'd find a way... What?

1389
01:10:56,712 --> 01:10:58,132
Hey, where's Dory? Is she with you?

1390

(GASPS) I'm sorry.

1391
01:11:00,382 --> 01:11:03,342
I tried to hold on,
but I couldn't and I lost her.

No!

even though I speak whale.

CHARLIE: Good thing I wasn't
there to see that.

1397

DORY: Actually Marlin never believes
I even know how to speak whale...

1398
01:11:13,812 --> 01:11:15,692
but you know what, he always kind of
trusts me anyway.

1399
01:11:15,856 --> 01:11:17,356
You know, I like this Marlin already.

1400
01:11:17,524 --> 01:11:19,994
Yeah. And then somehow
we found Nemo. Or did he find me?

1401
01:11:20,152 --> 01:11:22,572
I don't know. But, you know what,
Nemo is the sweetest.

1402
01:11:22,738 --> 01:11:24,448
He just never gives up on me
no matter what.

1403

Um, what would Dory do?

1404

Well, we'll certainly have to thank
Marlin and Nemo when we meet them.

That means I could...
Never see them again!

No! No, no, no. What would Dory do?

1416
01:11:55,061 --> 01:11:59,231
Uh, I know they're good friends of yours,
but a truck is kind of a tall order.

than good friends, they're family.

And I have to get them back.
See, when they found me it felt like fate.

Okay. That's okay. I can figure this out.
What was I just doing then?

1663
01:23:27,253 --> 01:23:31,263
I was, um, covering my face,
so I was trying to hide.

1664
01:23:31,424 --> 01:23:33,594
Okay, so why was I trying to hide? Wait!

Bring it in. Time for another...

When is Mr Ray coming back
from his migration?

If he's smart he'll stay away from here
as long as he can.

I'm your substitute teacher.

Nice day for a swim, huh?

01:24:05,958 --> 01:24:07,788
All right. Bye Mom. Bye Dad.

1683
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:11,510
Well, I guess we'll go back home
and brush up on the anemone.

You coming, Dory?

Me? Oh, I'm just going to the dropoff.

1686
01:24:15,635 --> 01:24:18,755
Oh, okay. What? The dropoff? No!

1687
01:24:18,846 --> 01:24:21,016
That's... That's a good idea?

1688
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:24,230
Yeah. I just thought
I'd go enjoy the view. Bye.

1689
01:24:24,935 --> 01:24:27,805
The view. Well, you have a good time!

You all right? You look worried.

No, no, no. I'm fine.
It's how I always look.

Sweetie, you just followed the shells
all the way back home.

Oh, my gosh! I did? All by myself?

1708
01:25:42,847 --> 01:25:45,177
- Yeah.
- Do you know what this means?

1709
01:25:45,891 --> 01:25:50,351
It means you can do
whatever you put your mind to, Dory.
