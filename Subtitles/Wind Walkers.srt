00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,415
Are you there?

164
00:15:51,018 --> 00:15:52,519
Yeah, I'm here.

165
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,588
You just disappeared.

166
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,228
- Hey. It's me.
- Careful.

167
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,663
- Careful of what?
- Nothing. I just...

168
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,465
What is that
supposed to mean?

169
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,701
I'm not ready to do this.

170
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:38,365
[Chattering]

171
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:39,899
Kelly! Kelly!

172
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:43,603
Come on, Kelly!
Come on!

173
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:53,380
Say "cheese."
[All]
Cheese!

174
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:31,951
You don't know
about the ritual?

175
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:34,387
- What ritual?
- "What ritual?"

176
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:36,556
Ah, goodness.
[Mutters]

177
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:38,091
Whoa. What ritual?

178
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:40,127
Give Doc your beer.
Beverage, sir.

179
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:42,028
Serious...
Take it seriously.
Okay.

180
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:43,530
Put your hands down.

181
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:45,165
- All right.
- Close your eyes.

182
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:46,733
Are they closed?
Yes.

183
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,536
Relax, please.
It's like a Zen meditation.

184
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:51,971
Now...

185
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:54,141
What do we
call this?

186
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:56,042
Uh, I don't know.

187
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:58,311
Full nelson.
Right.

188
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:00,680
Now, what do we
call this?

189
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:03,550
Oh, my God!

190
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:06,085
- Father nelson!
Father nelson!
- Get the hell off!

191
00:18:06,153 --> 00:18:07,687
Get the hell off of me!

192
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:10,123
Why does everything
gotta be sexual
between us?

193
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,758
Aw, you know
you liked it.

194
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:13,393
Get your ass over here.

195
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,396
Good to see you, bro.
Good to see you too, Sonny.

196
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:18,398
You still playing cowboy?

197
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,568
Better than
playing soldier.

198
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,004
Kotzy.
How you doing, buddy boy?

199
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:26,906
Hey, Doc.
Welcome home.

200
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:29,041
Heather.
How you doing, honey?

201
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,643
I'm okay.

202
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:35,448
Nah!
Hey! Whoo!

203
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:39,219
Good to see you, buddy.
Welcome home.

204
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:40,820
Thanks.
All right.

205
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:43,223
What do you say we get
a drink? Come on.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

206
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,858
[Chattering]

207
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:50,763
Wonderful.
It's just...

208
00:18:57,604 --> 00:19:00,740
[Whispering]
He's a Wind Walker.

209
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,219
What do you say, old man?

210
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:14,921
Old man?

211
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,557
I'll still kick
your ass.

212
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:18,625
[Chuckles]

213
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,695
Damn, Kotz.

214
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:24,197
You look a mess.

215
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:26,098
You ain't
so pretty yourself.

216
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,967
Getting old.

217
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:29,769
Where's Matty?

218
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:33,640
He hasn't called you?

219
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:36,643
No.
Come on.

220
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:48,888
He's AWOL.

221
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:50,757
AWOL?
Yep.

222
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:52,759
Left about a week ago.

223
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:56,763
Kept saying, uh,
he was needing
to get the hell out of here.

224
00:19:58,097 --> 00:20:00,867
[Sighs]
Woke up one morning and...
Now he's gone.

225
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:04,036
He just packed up
his duffel bag
and disappeared.

226
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:07,274
Haven't heard
from him since.

227
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:09,909
I was hoping you had.

228
00:20:11,278 --> 00:20:14,247
Not since
we were in country.

229
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,416
What is it?

230
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:19,419
People don't just
vanish like that.

231
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:23,456
Any feds come around?

232
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:25,191
No.

233
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:27,294
What the hell would feds
want with Matty?

234
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,469
[Chattering]

235
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:43,443
Aren't you gonna eat?
Gonna piss my mom off.

236
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,111
I'm just not
that hungry.

237
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:47,146
[Neelis]
Guys, listen up. Hey.

238
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:50,883
Sue and I...
Well, we just want to...
we want to thank all of you...

239
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:54,186
For coming year in and year out
to our annual gathering here.

240
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:58,491
We eat, we drink...
and we hunt.

241
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:00,026
Yeah!

242
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:04,764
It means...

243
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:06,333
So much...

244
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,537
[Exhales]
to us.

245
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,572
[Neelis]
Yes. Yes, it does.

246
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:15,207
To this thing
we call family.

247
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,809
Hear!
Hear!

248
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:18,110
Cheers!

249
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:20,046
Hear!
Cheers!

250

[Chattering Continues]

251
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:27,387
All right.
Where's dessert?

252
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:30,557
Yeah!

253
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:34,627
[Sue's Voice]
He's a Wind Walker.

254
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:37,497
[Chattering]

255
00:21:37,564 --> 00:21:40,066
[Sue's Voice]
A curse.

256
00:21:41,568 --> 00:21:44,904
- [Panting]
- [Voices Echoing]

257
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:50,643
Wind Walkers...
are coming.

258
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:54,914
- What's coming?
- A curse...

259
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:56,516
That rides on the wind.

260
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,585
[Neelis]
I'm sorry, folks.
She's just...

261
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,319
She's just
a little bit emotional.

262
00:22:00,387 --> 00:22:02,321
I'm not.

263
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:05,392
I'm not.
No, no, I'm not!

264
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,059
Come on, honey.
Come on, come on.
Come on.

265
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:08,895
No, no.
[Sobbing]

266
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:12,365
I'm not. I'm not.
No. No. I'm not.
[Whimpering]

267
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:14,801
[Neelis]
Come on. Come on.

268
00:22:16,903 --> 00:22:18,971
I'm sorry.
You just
need some rest.

269
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:21,007
Don't make me.
Okay.

270
00:22:29,482 --> 00:22:31,718
[Boy]
Dad?
Hmm.

271
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:33,553
Is Mom okay?

272
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:36,689
Yeah.
Yeah, she's fine.

273
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:41,561
She's just...
worn out with worry
about your brother.

274
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:46,933
[Boy]
What are, uh...

275
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:49,135
What are Wind Walkers?

276
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:51,538
A myth.

277
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:58,711
Okay. When our people
lost the land...

278
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:01,548
One of the things
they missed most...

279
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:05,351
Was the, uh,
sound in the wind moving.

280
00:23:05,418 --> 00:23:08,020
You know,
through the palms.

281
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:10,356
Wind Walkers.

282
00:23:10,423 --> 00:23:12,759
And when
the white armies came,

283
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:14,961
Fucking around
where they didn't belong,

284
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,598
They feared them.
Why?

285
00:23:20,467 --> 00:23:22,001
Because the Wind Walkers
would...

286
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:27,674
Stay behind
to grab the white man
in the night.

287
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,076
Ooooooh!

288
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:31,611
Quit it.
[Chuckles]

289
00:23:31,678 --> 00:23:33,145
You're
freaking me out.

290
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,182
It's blowback, Son.

291
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,017
The virus of war.

[Voices Whispering]

293
00:23:46,325 --> 00:23:49,195
- You doing okay?
- Yeah.

[Clears Throat]

295
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,899
I'm just having
a little trouble sleeping.

296
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:56,335
It's like I got a...
A choir in my head.

297
00:23:56,402 --> 00:23:57,870
[Scoffs]
Yeah, I bet.

298
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:01,440
That's like Byzantine shit
you went through, man.

300
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:06,245
Mad crazy.

301
00:24:06,312 --> 00:24:09,782
So they send you to, like, a...
Like a shrink or something?

302
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:14,821
They tried to.

303
00:24:16,422 --> 00:24:17,924
I didn't belong.

304
00:24:19,058 --> 00:24:20,960
Some people
don't belong anywhere.

305
00:24:23,362 --> 00:24:26,799
[Kotz]
You still pissed you didn't
have the nuts to join us?

306
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,703
Or you just knew
you couldn't shoot
for shit?

307
00:24:36,676 --> 00:24:38,811
You know,
I saw Lexi this morning.

308
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:41,581
The girl
is looking good.

309
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:44,183
Yeah.

310
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:47,854
Still feeling it?

311
00:24:51,758 --> 00:24:53,826
I'm feeling nothing.

Hut.

314
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:19,652
Time to go.

00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:22,722

Take care.

Bring me some meat.

Okay, sweetie.
Bye, Daddy.

Good-bye, sweetie.

Okay. You take care
of your mama, okay?
Okay. I love you.
