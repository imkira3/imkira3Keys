Hey, Rod, do they have
nude beaches in Florida?

3
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:10,320
Where are my magazines?
I'm sure I left them here somewhere.

4
00:02:10,405 --> 00:02:12,072
Leslie!

5
00:02:12,157 --> 00:02:15,451
Leslie, what'd you do
with my gol-darn golf balls?

6
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:17,202
Fifteen and a half sun block.

7
00:02:17,787 --> 00:02:18,829
Father, could I get
a string bikini in Florida?

8
00:02:18,913 --> 00:02:20,706
Make sure you pack your beach towel.

9
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,084
- Nobody can order pizza in this house.
- Where are my golf balls?

10
00:02:24,169 --> 00:02:27,546
- You know why? 'Cause I'm the only guy...
- Check in your pockets.

11
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,840
All right, has anybody seen my sun block?

12
00:02:29,924 --> 00:02:33,218
What's the point of going to Florida
if you're gonna put on sun block?

13
00:02:33,303 --> 00:02:36,263
I don't care if I age like an old suitcase.
I'm getting toasted.

14
00:02:36,347 --> 00:02:40,184
Great. Now you can be a skag
with a slightly darker shade of skin.

15
00:02:40,268 --> 00:02:44,354
He's just jealous 'cause he can't tan.
His freckles just connect.

16
00:02:44,856 --> 00:02:48,692
Hey, hey, easy on the fluids, pal.
The rubber sheets are packed.

17
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:52,946
Vicky says she wants to go with "Ding."
Behind "Ding" is 200 points.

18
00:02:53,031 --> 00:02:55,115
All right. Good for you.

19
00:02:57,452 --> 00:02:59,912
Two hundred points. All right.

20
00:03:02,832 --> 00:03:05,084
- Honey, are you packed yet?
- Yes.

21
00:03:06,503 --> 00:03:07,961
Yes.

22
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:12,925
- Everything I put out for you?
- Yes.

23
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:15,511
Yes.

24
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:18,639
Did you see what Grandma Penelope
sent you for the trip?

25
00:03:18,723 --> 00:03:21,308
Let me guess. Donald Duck slippers?

26
00:03:22,352 --> 00:03:25,854
Close. An inflatable clown
to play with in the pool.

27
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:28,315
How exciting.

28
00:03:29,234 --> 00:03:32,778
Why do we have to go to Florida?
There's no Christmas trees in Florida.

29
00:03:32,862 --> 00:03:34,947
Kevin, what is it with you
and Christmas trees?

30
00:03:35,031 --> 00:03:37,950
How could you have Christmas
without a Christmas tree, Mom?

31
00:03:38,034 --> 00:03:41,995
We'll find a nice, fake silver one
or decorate a palm tree.

32
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,873
Goodbye, everybody.

33
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,584
Guests of the new
Celebrity Ding Dang Dong

34
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:50,462
stay at the world-renowned Plaza Hotel,

35
00:03:50,547 --> 00:03:53,132
New York's most exciting
hotel experience.

36
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:57,719
For reservations, call toll-free 1-800-759...

37
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:00,389
Honey, do you know where the batteries
for this camcorder are?

38
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:02,808
Yeah, I put it in the charger.

39
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:16,822
- How's this?
- Much better.

40
00:04:18,032 --> 00:04:19,992
Hey, Kevin, you better go put your tie on.

41
00:04:20,076 --> 00:04:21,952
We don't want to be late
for the Christmas pageant.

42
00:04:22,036 --> 00:04:24,204
My tie's in the bathroom.
I can't go in there,

43
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:26,248
'cause Uncle Frank's taking a shower.

44
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:28,834
He says if I walked in there
and saw him naked,

45
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:31,837
I'd grow up never feeling like a real man.

46
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:34,339
Whatever that means.

47
00:04:36,092 --> 00:04:37,384
I'm sure he was kidding.

48
00:04:37,468 --> 00:04:42,347
Just run in there and get your tie,
get out, and don't look at anything.

49
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:48,353
Well, this cat they're talking about

50
00:04:48,438 --> 00:04:51,190
I wonder who could it be

51
00:04:51,274 --> 00:04:54,193
'Cause they know I'm the heaviest cat

52
00:04:54,277 --> 00:04:57,613
The heaviest cat you ever did see

53
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:00,532
When they see me
walking down the street

54
00:05:00,617 --> 00:05:03,327
When the fellas want to speak
Hey, hey

55
00:05:03,411 --> 00:05:05,454
On their faces they wear a silly smirk

56
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:11,043
'Cause they know I'm the king
of the cool jerk

57
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:17,799
Get out of here, you nosy little pervert,
or I'm gonna slap you silly!

58
00:05:19,761 --> 00:05:22,304
You're cooking, Frankie!

59
00:05:30,271 --> 00:05:33,732
Christmas tree, my Christmas tree

60
00:05:33,816 --> 00:05:37,569
Lit up like a star

61
00:05:37,654 --> 00:05:40,989
When I see my Christmas tree

62
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:44,868
Can loved ones be far?

63
00:05:44,953 --> 00:05:48,288
Christmas tree, I'm certain

64
00:05:48,373 --> 00:05:51,833
Wherever I roam...

65
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,670
Kevin's solo's coming up. Tell Leslie.

66
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:57,339
Kevin's solo's coming up. Tell Frank.

67
00:05:57,423 --> 00:06:00,425
Okay. Frank... Frank!

68
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:09,309
Christmastime means laughter

69
00:06:09,394 --> 00:06:13,105
Toboggans in the snow

70
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:16,108
Caroling to children

71
00:06:16,192 --> 00:06:18,193
With faces aglow

72
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:23,573
Stockings on the mantel

73
00:06:23,658 --> 00:06:27,077
A wreath on the door

74
00:06:27,161 --> 00:06:30,622
And my merriest Christmas

75
00:06:30,707 --> 00:06:31,748
Stop it!

76
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,584
Needs just one thing more

77
00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:37,963
Christmas tree, my Christmas tree

78
00:06:38,047 --> 00:06:40,090
Lit up like...

79
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,731
Kevin!

80
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,949
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

81
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:13,999
I'd like to apologize to my family

82
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,293
for whatever displeasure
I might have caused you.

83
00:07:16,377 --> 00:07:17,502
What?

84
00:07:17,587 --> 00:07:20,255
My prank was immature and ill-timed.

85
00:07:20,757 --> 00:07:24,593
Immature or not,
it was pretty gol-darn hilarious.

86
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:29,264
I'd also like to apologize to my brother.

87
00:07:30,058 --> 00:07:32,517
Kevin, I'm sorry.

88
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,397
Buzz, that was very nice.

89
00:07:42,612 --> 00:07:45,906
Kevin, do you have something to say?

90
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,842
Beat that, you little trout sniffer.

91
00:08:10,431 --> 00:08:13,683
I'm not sorry!
I did what I did 'cause Buzz humiliated me.

92
00:08:13,768 --> 00:08:16,395
And since he gets away with everything,
I let him have it.

93
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,897
And since you're all so stupid
to believe his lies,

94
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:21,942
I don't care if your idiotic Florida trip
gets wrecked or not.

95
00:08:22,026 --> 00:08:25,904
Who wants to spend Christmas
in a tropical climate anyway?

96
00:08:25,988 --> 00:08:27,072
Kevin!

97
00:08:27,156 --> 00:08:29,699
Kevin, you walk out of here,
you sleep on the third floor.

98
00:08:29,784 --> 00:08:33,245
- Yeah, with me.
- So what else is new?

99
00:08:33,329 --> 00:08:35,831
You'd better not wreck my trip,
you little sourpuss.

100
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:37,916
Your dad's paying good money for it.

101
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,336
I wouldn't want to spoil your fun,
Mr. Cheapskate.

102
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:48,343
What a troubled young man.

103
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:55,142
They're all a bunch ofjerks.

104
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,644
Hi.

105
00:08:59,814 --> 00:09:01,773
You know, Kevin,
last time we all tried to take a trip

106
00:09:01,858 --> 00:09:04,651
we had a problem
that started just like this.

107
00:09:04,735 --> 00:09:06,903
Yeah, with me getting crapped on.

108
00:09:06,988 --> 00:09:08,613
I don't care for your choice of words.

109
00:09:08,698 --> 00:09:11,408
That's not what happened last time,
that's not what's happening this time.

110
00:09:11,492 --> 00:09:13,618
Buzz apologized to you.

111
00:09:13,703 --> 00:09:16,329
Yeah, then he called me a trout sniffer.

112
00:09:16,414 --> 00:09:19,541
He didn't mean what he said.
He was just sucking up to you.

113
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:23,587
Okay. Why don't you just sit up here
for a while and think things over?

114
00:09:23,671 --> 00:09:26,381
When you're ready to apologize
to Buzz and to the rest of the family,

115
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:27,507
you can come down.

116
00:09:27,592 --> 00:09:31,803
I'm not apologizing to Buzz.
I'd rather kiss a toilet seat.

117
00:09:31,888 --> 00:09:34,014
Then you can stay up here
the rest of the night.

118
00:09:34,098 --> 00:09:38,310
Fine. I don't wanna be down there anyway.
I can't trust anybody in this family.

119
00:09:38,394 --> 00:09:40,604
And d'you know what?
If I had my own money,

120
00:09:40,688 --> 00:09:44,649
I'd go on my own vacation,
alone, without any of you guys.

121
00:09:44,734 --> 00:09:47,527
And I'd have the most fun in my whole life.

122
00:09:47,612 --> 00:09:50,655
Well, you got your wish last year.
Maybe you'll get it again this year.

123
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,324
I hope so.

124
00:10:41,123 --> 00:10:43,625
- We did it again!
- We did it again!

125
00:10:53,761 --> 00:10:56,721
Okay, our McCallisters in the first van,
the other McCallisters in the second van.

126
00:10:56,806 --> 00:10:58,223
I know I shouldn't complain
about a free trip,

127
00:10:58,307 --> 00:11:00,725
but, jeez, you guys give
the worst gol-darn wake-up calls.

128
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,519
- Frank, do you have the tickets?
- I've got them.

129
00:11:02,603 --> 00:11:06,147
- Here's your family's. I've got my family's.
- How many do you have?

130
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:07,399
- Seven.
- Seven.

131
00:11:07,483 --> 00:11:09,317
- Fourteen.
- Fourteen.

132
00:11:12,446 --> 00:11:17,075
Seven, eight, nine, ten...

133
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,326
How come none of us are sitting together?

134
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,412
At this time of the year,
we're lucky to get on the same plane.

135
00:11:20,496 --> 00:11:23,498
Eleven, twelve, thirteen...

136
00:11:25,793 --> 00:11:27,377
Where's Kevin?

137
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:29,629
Fourteen.

138
00:11:29,714 --> 00:11:34,593
It's a good thing I have my own ticket,
just in case you guys try to ditch me.

139
00:11:44,562 --> 00:11:46,479
- Come on, Kevin.
- Dad, I need batteries.

140
00:11:46,564 --> 00:11:49,107
I got some batteries in my bag.
I'll give them to you on the plane.

141
00:11:49,191 --> 00:11:51,318
- Here's two more.
- Why can't I get them now? I can get them.

142
00:11:51,402 --> 00:11:55,822
- Not now, Kevin. What's the gate number?
- H17, sir.

143
00:11:55,906 --> 00:11:57,032
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

144
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,200
Hey, you better hurry up. It's the last gate.

145
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:00,452
- All the way down.
- Wow.

146
00:12:00,536 --> 00:12:03,371
- Dad, what gate is it?
- H17, Buzz. Come on, Kevin.

147
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:07,500
Kevin, you gonna take my bag?
You take my bag? Come on. Come on.

148
00:12:31,525 --> 00:12:33,860
Watch it, watch it, watch it.

149
00:12:34,528 --> 00:12:39,574
American Airlines flight 226 to New York
is now in the final boarding process.

150
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,246
Come on, come on.

151
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:55,674
Dad, wait up!

152
00:12:56,634 --> 00:12:58,009
Wait up!

153
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:00,261
Wait!

154
00:13:00,554 --> 00:13:03,765
- Look out! Look out!
- Come on, come on, come on!

155
00:13:09,063 --> 00:13:10,730
Dad, wait!

156
00:13:15,986 --> 00:13:17,821
Here we are. Here.

157
00:13:21,575 --> 00:13:25,203
- We made it all.
- Everybody here? We made it? All right.

158
00:13:25,287 --> 00:13:27,497
Please, ma'am, you have to board.
The plane is ready to leave.

159
00:13:27,581 --> 00:13:29,165
- Let me just make sure everyone gets on.
- Come on.

160
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,751
Don't worry, ma'am,
we'll get everybody on the flight.

161
00:13:31,836 --> 00:13:34,045
- Merry Christmas. Have a nice flight.
- Merry Christmas.

162
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:35,797
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

163
00:13:38,676 --> 00:13:41,845
Hey, wait up! Hey, guys, wait for me!

164
00:13:43,806 --> 00:13:45,515
- Cutting it kind of close.
- Yeah, sorry.

165
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,767
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you.

166
00:13:47,852 --> 00:13:49,352
Dad, wait up!

167
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:51,563
Wait!

168
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:54,190
I'm sorry.

169
00:13:54,275 --> 00:13:57,694
- That's all right. Are you on this flight?
- Yeah, so is my family.

170
00:13:57,778 --> 00:14:00,238
They're already on the plane,
and I don't want to be left behind.

171
00:14:00,322 --> 00:14:02,907
- Do you have a boarding pass?
- It's somewhere.

172
00:14:02,992 --> 00:14:04,451
We have to close up here.
They're ready to go.

173
00:14:04,535 --> 00:14:07,078
- He dropped his boarding pass.
- This plane can't leave.

174
00:14:07,163 --> 00:14:09,831
This happened to me last year
and almost wrecked my Christmas.

175
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:11,583
Are you sure your family's on this flight?

176
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:15,211
Yeah. My dad ran in here
right before I bumped into this lady.

177
00:14:15,296 --> 00:14:19,382
Okay, board him, but make sure he locates
his family before you leave him.

178
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:21,092
Okay. Come on.

179
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,806
Do you see your family?

180
00:14:26,891 --> 00:14:30,602
- There's my dad over there.
- Okay. Well, go find an empty seat.

181
00:14:30,686 --> 00:14:31,811
- Have a merry Christmas.
- You, too.

182
00:14:31,896 --> 00:14:34,481
Ladies and gentlemen, in order
for the captain to push back from the gate,

183
00:14:34,565 --> 00:14:37,525
we need all passengers to be seated
with their seat belts securely fastened.

184
00:15:06,096 --> 00:15:08,723
So, have you ever been to Florida?

185
00:15:33,249 --> 00:15:38,086
Welcome aboard American Airlines
flight 176 nonstop to New York...

186
00:15:48,764 --> 00:15:51,808
Boy, I didn't think
we were going to make it.

187
00:15:53,978 --> 00:15:56,312
Something wrong? Honey?

188
00:15:57,147 --> 00:15:59,065
I have that feeling.

189
00:15:59,817 --> 00:16:01,693
We forgot something?

190
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:06,656
No, I don't think we did, but I...
I just have that feeling.

191
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,366
Bad memories, that's all.

192
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:12,453
We did everything, we brought everything,
we have everybody.

193
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,498
There's nothing to worry about.

194
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:21,170
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
You're right. We're fine.

195
00:16:21,797 --> 00:16:24,048
Nothing to worry about.

196
00:16:43,527 --> 00:16:44,903
Mom?

197
00:16:46,322 --> 00:16:47,739
Dad?

198
00:16:48,824 --> 00:16:50,325
Uncle Frank?

199
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:53,286
Buzz?

200
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,756
- We're the last ones off the plane.
- Okay, thanks.

201
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:10,303
Where are those guys?

202
00:17:16,477 --> 00:17:17,644
- Whose is this?
- That's Brooke's.

203
00:17:17,728 --> 00:17:20,229
This is Megan's. Brooke.
Give this to Brooke.

204
00:17:20,314 --> 00:17:24,192
- This to Kevin. Give this to Kevin.
- Give this... Give this to Kevin.

205
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:26,277
- Give this to Kevin.
- Give this to Kevin.

206
00:17:26,362 --> 00:17:27,779
- Kevin.
- Give this to Kevin.

207
00:17:27,863 --> 00:17:32,408
- Give this to Kevin.
- Give this to Kevin.

208
00:17:32,493 --> 00:17:35,453
- Give this to Kevin.
- Here you go, Kevin.

209
00:17:42,211 --> 00:17:56,557
- Kevin's not here.
- Kevin's not here.

210
00:17:57,559 --> 00:17:58,893
What?

211
00:18:02,606 --> 00:18:03,940
Kevin!

212
00:18:32,302 --> 00:18:34,929
Excuse me, but this is an emergency.

213
00:18:36,098 --> 00:18:38,975
- Yes, sir?
- What city is that over there?

214
00:18:41,103 --> 00:18:45,189
- That's New York, sir.
- Yikes, I did it again.

215
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:52,280
Something wrong, sir?

216
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,451
I'll be fine.

217
00:19:05,794 --> 00:19:09,964
Oh, no.
My family's in Florida and I'm in New York.

218
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:14,135
My family's in Florida.

219
00:19:15,137 --> 00:19:18,097
I'm in New York.

220
00:19:53,217 --> 00:19:54,967
Thanks! Bye!

221
00:20:28,544 --> 00:20:29,961
Wow.

222
00:21:04,746 --> 00:21:06,455
What's the child's name?

223
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:09,333
- Kevin. K-E-V-l-N.
- Kevin.

224
00:21:09,418 --> 00:21:12,753
- When did you see him last?
- Curbside check-in?

225
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:16,632
No, I saw him at the door.
He was with us in the terminal.

226
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:20,553
Most people get separated
at security checkpoints.

227
00:21:20,637 --> 00:21:23,681
- Did everyone get through security?
- I don't know. Peter?

228
00:21:23,765 --> 00:21:27,602
We were in a hurry. We were in a hurry.
We had to run all the way to the gate.

229
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:30,313
When did you notice he was missing?

230
00:21:31,273 --> 00:21:33,983
When we picked up our baggage here.

231
00:21:34,943 --> 00:21:36,527
Has the boy ever run away from home?

232
00:21:36,612 --> 00:21:38,029
- No.
- No.

233
00:21:38,113 --> 00:21:41,991
Has he ever been in a situation
where he's been on his own?

234
00:21:45,954 --> 00:21:49,332
As a matter of fact,
this has happened before.

235
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:53,544
It's becoming sort of
a McCallister family travel tradition.

236
00:21:53,629 --> 00:21:56,797
Funnily enough, we never lose our luggage.

237
00:22:08,685 --> 00:22:11,812
He was left at home by accident last year.

238
00:22:12,648 --> 00:22:14,148
Yeah, that's what my wife meant

239
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:18,319
when she said it's becoming
a McCallister family travel tradition.

240
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:24,200
We'll call Chicago
and notify them of the situation.

241
00:22:24,284 --> 00:22:28,246
- The odds are that's where he is.
- Thanks.

242
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:31,290
It's very unlikely he'd be anywhere else.

243
00:22:46,723 --> 00:22:48,683
Watch out, kid!

244
00:23:01,071 --> 00:23:03,197
Yo, where's your manifest?

245
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:12,206
Here we are, Marv.
New York City, the land of opportunity.

246
00:23:13,709 --> 00:23:16,711
- Smell that?
- Yeah.

247
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:18,421
- You know what that is?
- Fish.

248
00:23:19,756 --> 00:23:22,633
- It's freedom.
- No, it's fish.

249
00:23:23,302 --> 00:23:27,638
- It's freedom, and it's money.
- Okay, okay. It's freedom.

250
00:23:27,723 --> 00:23:30,474
Come on, let's get out of here
before somebody sees us.

251
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,226
And it's fish.

252
00:23:38,191 --> 00:23:43,321
Yup, one quick score. We get ourselves
a couple of phony passports

253
00:23:43,405 --> 00:23:46,824
and we hightail it to some foreign country.

254
00:23:46,908 --> 00:23:48,409
Arizona?

255
00:23:53,582 --> 00:23:59,170
That's very smart, Marv. You bust out of
jail to rob 14 cents from a Santa Claus?

256
00:23:59,254 --> 00:24:03,341
Every little bit helps.
Besides, now we got our new nickname.

257
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:06,093
We're the Sticky Bandits.

258
00:24:06,762 --> 00:24:09,764
Real cute. Very cute.

259
00:24:26,823 --> 00:24:30,743
"The Plaza Hotel, New York's
most exciting hotel experience."

260
00:24:43,965 --> 00:24:45,299
Sick.

261
00:25:42,732 --> 00:25:46,193
- What's the matter?
- Thought I saw something.

262
00:26:02,085 --> 00:26:04,795
Serves you right. Come on, let's go!

263
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,964
I think she likes me.

264
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,753
Excuse me. Where's the lobby?

265
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:48,797
- Down the hall and to the left.
- Thanks.

266
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:03,812
Wow!

267
00:27:12,531 --> 00:27:14,907
Guests of the new
Celebrity Ding Dang Dong

268
00:27:14,991 --> 00:27:17,743
stay at the world-renowned Plaza Hotel,

269
00:27:17,827 --> 00:27:20,412
New York's most exciting
hotel experience.

270
00:27:20,497 --> 00:27:26,502
For reservations,
call toll-free 1-800-759-3000.

271
00:27:28,004 --> 00:27:29,755
I'll do just that.

272
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:33,717
Howdy-do.
This is Peter McCallister, the father.

273
00:27:33,802 --> 00:27:38,389
I'd like a hotel room, please,
with an extra-large bed, a TV,

274
00:27:38,473 --> 00:27:42,017
and one of those little refrigerators
you have to open with a key.

275
00:27:42,102 --> 00:27:43,852
Credit card? You got it.

276
00:27:47,941 --> 00:27:50,150
Plaza Hotel reservations. May I help you?

277
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:51,402
Howdy-do.

278
00:27:51,486 --> 00:27:54,822
- This is Peter McCallister, the father.
- Yes, sir.

279
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:57,116
- I'd like a hotel room, please...
- Yes.

280
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:02,329
...with an extra-large bed, a TV,
and one of those little refrigerators

281
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:04,665
you have to open with a key.

282
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:06,709
Yes, sir, you'll need
a major credit card upon check-in.

283
00:28:07,335 --> 00:28:09,670
Credit card? You got it.

284
00:28:10,505 --> 00:28:12,840
Thank you. Enjoy your stay.

285
00:28:16,177 --> 00:28:19,346
Yes, two at 8:00, Henri, Mr. Yamamoto.

286
00:28:20,223 --> 00:28:22,099
Hold on a second.

287
00:28:26,062 --> 00:28:28,188
I'll call you back, Henri.

288
00:28:30,734 --> 00:28:31,900
Hi.

289
00:28:36,364 --> 00:28:39,742
- Can I help you?
- Reservation for McCallister?

290
00:28:41,745 --> 00:28:43,954
A reservation for yourself?

291
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:46,540
Ma'am, my feet are
hardly touching the ground.

292
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:48,792
I'm barely able to look over this counter.

293
00:28:48,877 --> 00:28:51,462
How could I make a reservation
for a hotel room?

294
00:28:51,546 --> 00:28:57,384
Think about it, a kid going into a hotel,
making a reservation? I don't think so.

295
00:28:59,012 --> 00:29:00,846
I'm confused.

296
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:04,850
I'm traveling with my dad.
He's on business. He's at a meeting.

297
00:29:04,934 --> 00:29:07,811
I hate meetings,
plus I'm not allowed to go in.

298
00:29:07,896 --> 00:29:12,566
I can only sit in the lobby. That's boring.
So my dad dropped me off here.

299
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:16,945
He gave me his credit card
and said whoever was checking people in

300
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:20,491
to let me in the hotel room
so I won't get into mischief,

301
00:29:20,575 --> 00:29:23,577
and, ma'am,
sometimes I do get into mischief.

302
00:29:24,871 --> 00:29:26,330
We all do.

303
00:29:28,917 --> 00:29:30,668
Merry Christmas.

304
00:29:32,045 --> 00:29:33,754
No sign of him.

305
00:29:34,381 --> 00:29:36,256
We're gonna have to be able
to get a hold of you.

306
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:38,467
- You have hotel arrangements?
- Yeah.

307
00:29:38,551 --> 00:29:41,345
Do you have a recent photo of the boy?

308
00:29:42,931 --> 00:29:45,015
I have one in my wallet.

309
00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:48,102
I don't have my wallet.

310
00:29:48,812 --> 00:29:50,729
My wallet's in my bag.

311
00:29:51,314 --> 00:29:52,898
Kevin was looking in my bag at the airport.

312
00:29:52,982 --> 00:29:55,192
He was looking for batteries.
Kevin has my wallet.

313
00:29:55,276 --> 00:29:58,362
- Did you have credit cards in the wallet?
- Credit cards, money.

314
00:29:58,446 --> 00:30:02,116
We'll notify the credit card companies
immediately. If your son has the cards,

315
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,744
we can get a location on him
when and if he uses them.

316
00:30:05,829 --> 00:30:08,706
No, I don't think Kevin even knows
how to use a credit card.

317
00:30:11,584 --> 00:30:13,252
Wow! It worked.

318
00:30:17,132 --> 00:30:18,716
- Cedric.
- Yes?

319
00:30:19,134 --> 00:30:22,302
- Don't count your tips in public.
- I'm sorry.

320
00:30:22,846 --> 00:30:26,974
And find out everything you can
about that young fellow.

321
00:30:28,184 --> 00:30:29,810
Front, please.

322
00:30:34,524 --> 00:30:36,400
Enjoy your stay with us.

323
00:30:36,484 --> 00:30:40,028
And don't forget to remind your dad
when he arrives

324
00:30:40,113 --> 00:30:42,489
that he has to come down
and sign a couple of things.

325
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:44,783
Thank you. You've been most helpful.

326
00:30:44,868 --> 00:30:46,910
May I take your bag, sir?

327
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:52,958
Up here to your left.

328
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,253
You know, Herbert Hoover
once stayed here on this floor.

329
00:30:56,337 --> 00:30:59,673
- The vacuum guy?
- No, the president.

330
00:31:05,054 --> 00:31:07,806
This is one of our finest suites, sir.

331
00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:17,608
This is great!

332
00:31:23,031 --> 00:31:25,949
Wow! A huge bed just for me!

333
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:35,709
Luxurious and spacious.

334
00:31:42,383 --> 00:31:44,051
How convenient!

335
00:31:47,388 --> 00:31:48,555
Hey!

336
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:54,812
Did you want me to put the key in the bag
or did you just want to hang on to it?

337
00:31:54,896 --> 00:31:56,730
I'll hang on to it.

338
00:31:59,818 --> 00:32:01,485
Is everything all right, sir?

339
00:32:01,569 --> 00:32:04,071
- Is the temperature in the room okay?
- It's okay.

340
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:08,200
- Do you know how the TV works?
- I'm 10 years old. TV's my life.

341
00:32:09,118 --> 00:32:10,410
Well...

342
00:32:14,415 --> 00:32:15,916
I'm sorry.

343
00:32:20,755 --> 00:32:23,841
And there's plenty more
where that came from.

344
00:32:25,802 --> 00:32:27,261
Thank you.

345
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:57,875
Would it bother anyone
if I worked on my cannonballs?

346
00:32:57,959 --> 00:32:59,126
No.

347
00:33:00,003 --> 00:33:01,378
Thanks.

348
00:33:14,267 --> 00:33:15,475
Yikes!

349
00:33:37,373 --> 00:33:39,416
This is a vacation.

350
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:42,878
Hold it right there.

351
00:33:42,962 --> 00:33:44,755
It's me, Johnny.

352
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:49,134
I knew it was you.
I could smell you getting off the elevator.

353
00:33:50,637 --> 00:33:54,431
- Two scoops, sir?
- Two? Make it three. I'm not driving.

354
00:33:54,515 --> 00:33:56,975
It's gardenias, Johnny, your favorite.

355
00:33:57,852 --> 00:33:58,894
Thank you.

356
00:33:58,978 --> 00:34:02,105
You was here last night, too, wasn't you?

357
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:04,608
I was singin' at the Blue Monkey last night.

358
00:34:04,692 --> 00:34:07,444
She was not!
She was smooching with your brother.

359
00:34:07,528 --> 00:34:11,114
You was here,
and you was smooching with my brother!

360
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,075
- That's a dirty, rotten lie, Johnny.
- See?

361
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:16,286
Don't give me that.
You been smooching with everybody!

362
00:34:16,371 --> 00:34:20,999
Snuffy, Al, Leo,
Little Mo with the gimpy leg,

363
00:34:21,084 --> 00:34:25,671
Cheeks, Bony Bob, Cliff,
I could go on forever, baby.

364
00:34:25,755 --> 00:34:30,258
- You got me all wrong.
- All right. I believe you,

365
00:34:30,343 --> 00:34:32,260
but my Tommy gun don't!

366
00:34:33,096 --> 00:34:34,388
Johnny!

367
00:34:35,014 --> 00:34:36,932
You're the only duck in my pond!

368
00:34:37,016 --> 00:34:39,768
Get down on your knees
and tell me you love me.

369
00:34:39,852 --> 00:34:42,813
Baby! I'm over the moon for you!

370
00:34:42,897 --> 00:34:45,524
You got to do better than that!

371
00:34:45,608 --> 00:34:47,317
If my love was an ocean,

372
00:34:47,402 --> 00:34:50,779
Lindy'd have to take
two airplanes to get across it!

373
00:34:51,948 --> 00:34:55,117
Maybe I'm off my hinges, but I believe you.

374
00:34:55,868 --> 00:34:58,120
That's why I'm gonna let you go.

375
00:34:58,204 --> 00:35:00,872
I'm going to give you to the count of three

376
00:35:00,957 --> 00:35:07,587
to get your lousy, lying, lowdown,
four-flushing carcass out my door!

377
00:35:08,214 --> 00:35:10,048
She's rat bait.

378
00:35:10,133 --> 00:35:11,299
One,

379
00:35:12,385 --> 00:35:13,719
two,

380
00:35:22,645 --> 00:35:23,812
three!

381
00:35:23,896 --> 00:35:26,440
Merry Christmas, you filthy animal.

382
00:35:28,776 --> 00:35:30,736
And a happy New Year.

383
00:36:03,811 --> 00:36:05,270
Housekeeping.

384
00:36:45,686 --> 00:36:55,487
We know a cat
who can really do the cool jerk

385
00:36:55,571 --> 00:36:59,533
Well, this cat they talkin' about

386
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:02,285
I wonder who could it be

387
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:05,413
'Cause I know I'm the heaviest cat

388
00:37:05,498 --> 00:37:08,083
The heaviest cat you ever did see

389
00:37:08,876 --> 00:37:11,670
When they see me walkin' down the street

390
00:37:11,754 --> 00:37:14,548
When the fellas want to speak
Hey, hey

391
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:16,758
On their faces, they wear a silly smirk

392
00:37:16,843 --> 00:37:22,222
'Cause they know I'm the king
of the cool jerk

393
00:37:26,018 --> 00:37:30,397
Get out of here, you nosy little pervert,
or I'm gonna slap you silly!

394
00:37:33,401 --> 00:37:36,153
You're cooking, Frankie!

395
00:38:12,607 --> 00:38:15,400
Didn't look this bad on our honeymoon.

396
00:38:31,959 --> 00:38:34,211
Hey! Uncle Rob lives here.

397
00:38:34,295 --> 00:38:37,547
If they're back from Paris,
I'll drop in on them.

398
00:38:37,632 --> 00:38:40,550
They usually give pretty good presents.

399
00:39:39,694 --> 00:39:41,361
Good night, Mom.

400
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:48,576
Good night, Kevin.

401
00:40:15,521 --> 00:40:17,314
Your drawers, sir.

402
00:40:17,398 --> 00:40:20,358
Jeez! Don't flash these babies
around here!

403
00:40:20,443 --> 00:40:24,404
- There could be girls on this floor!
- I was very careful, sir.

404
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:27,157
You can't be too careful
when it involves underwear.

405
00:40:27,241 --> 00:40:31,036
- I understand.
- I'm sorry. You wanted a tip.

406
00:40:32,121 --> 00:40:36,124
That won't be necessary, sir.
I still have some tip left over.

407
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:40,045
No tip? Okay.

408
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:43,590
No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait!

409
00:40:45,051 --> 00:40:47,010
Excuse me, how do I get
to Columbus Circle?

410
00:40:47,094 --> 00:40:50,221
The doorman will be happy
to find you a taxi, sir.

411
00:40:50,306 --> 00:40:52,057
Mr. McCallister!

412
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:57,354
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

413
00:41:00,733 --> 00:41:02,817
And how are we this morning?

414
00:41:02,902 --> 00:41:06,196
- Fine. Is my transportation here?
- Out in front, sir.

415
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:11,159
A limousine and a pizza,
compliments of the Plaza Hotel.

416
00:41:11,243 --> 00:41:16,039
I do hope your father understands that
last night I was simply checking the room

417
00:41:16,123 --> 00:41:18,208
to make sure everything was in order.

418
00:41:18,292 --> 00:41:20,752
- He was pretty mad.
- He was?

419
00:41:20,836 --> 00:41:22,545
He said he didn't come
all the way to New York

420
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:27,175
- to get his naked rear end spied on.
- Of course not.

421
00:41:27,259 --> 00:41:30,470
- Will he be down soon?
- He already left.

422
00:41:33,474 --> 00:41:36,893
I would have liked
to have offered my personal apology.

423
00:41:36,977 --> 00:41:40,939
If some guy looked at you in the shower,
would you ever want to see him again?

424
00:41:41,023 --> 00:41:42,565
I suppose not.

425
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:45,693
I don't think you'll see him
for the rest of our trip.

426
00:41:45,778 --> 00:41:47,320
I understand.

427
00:41:48,322 --> 00:41:49,489
Bye.

428
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:53,868
Have a lovely day.

429
00:42:03,337 --> 00:42:05,296
McCallister.

430
00:42:18,227 --> 00:42:21,146
- Morning, Mr. McCallister.
- Good morning.

431
00:42:28,195 --> 00:42:32,574
Mr. McCallister,
here's your very own cheese pizza.

432
00:42:55,222 --> 00:42:57,474
- Hello?
- Hello.

433
00:42:57,558 --> 00:43:00,435
- Know any good toy stores?
- Yes, sir!

434
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:20,705
Bingo!

435
00:43:35,638 --> 00:43:38,973
Get out of here! Go on, get out!
Get out of here! Go on. Get out of here!

436
00:43:39,058 --> 00:43:41,434
Beat it, beat it, beat it! Get out of here!

437
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:44,854
Hey, Marv! Get over here!
I got to talk to you!

438
00:43:55,324 --> 00:43:56,950
Whoa! Whoa!

439
00:43:59,453 --> 00:44:02,080
- Would you like a scarf?
- You wanna forget about the scarf, Marv?

440
00:44:02,164 --> 00:44:03,790
We got to talk.

441
00:44:04,333 --> 00:44:06,834
We don't have the equipment
to pull off anything big,

442
00:44:06,919 --> 00:44:09,087
you know, your banks,
your jewelry stores.

443
00:44:09,171 --> 00:44:12,632
We don't want goods.
We need cash, and we need it now.

444
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:18,054
How about hotels?
Tourists carry lots of cash.

445
00:44:18,138 --> 00:44:20,765
There's no guarantees. I got a better idea.

446
00:44:20,849 --> 00:44:23,476
Stores ain't gonna deposit cash
on Christmas Eve.

447
00:44:23,561 --> 00:44:25,895
The only stores that are
gonna have cash on hand

448
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:28,690
are the ones that deal
in moderate-priced goods.

449
00:44:28,774 --> 00:44:30,191
Right, right.

450
00:44:30,276 --> 00:44:34,070
Ergo, what store's gonna make
the most cash on Christmas Eve

451
00:44:34,154 --> 00:44:36,864
that nobody's going to think to rob?

452
00:44:36,949 --> 00:44:38,491
Candy stores.

453
00:44:39,326 --> 00:44:44,581
Nine-year-olds rob candy stores, Marv.
This is what I had in mind.

454
00:44:46,375 --> 00:44:49,002
That's brilliant, Harry. Brilliant!

455
00:44:50,671 --> 00:44:55,300
Yep. There's nobody dumb enough
to knock off a toy store on Christmas Eve.

456
00:44:55,384 --> 00:44:57,051
Yes, there is.

457
00:45:15,362 --> 00:45:18,197
Here we are, sir, Duncan's Toy Chest.

458
00:45:19,867 --> 00:45:21,951
Merry Christmas, Kevin.

459
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:07,497
This is the greatest accident of my life.

460
00:46:25,808 --> 00:46:27,475
Marv. Marv!

461
00:46:28,102 --> 00:46:30,603
Hey, nice house,
but there's no bathroom in it.

462
00:46:33,899 --> 00:46:37,860
- All right, so what's the plan?
- Everybody leaves for a nice holiday off.

463
00:46:37,945 --> 00:46:40,488
We come out of our little houses...

464
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:45,743
- Yeah, then what?
- We empty the registers

465
00:46:45,828 --> 00:46:49,455
- and walk out like we own the joint.
- Great plan, Harry!

466
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:51,332
Shake his hand.

467
00:46:51,417 --> 00:46:53,793
Well, now, thank you
and merry Christmas.

468
00:46:53,877 --> 00:46:56,045
Say hello to the family.

469
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,757
Yes. Let me see.

470
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:03,886
You shopping alone?

471
00:47:03,971 --> 00:47:07,432
In New York?
Sir, I'm afraid of my own shadow.

472
00:47:07,516 --> 00:47:10,727
- Now, I was just checking.
- That's very responsible of you.

473
00:47:10,811 --> 00:47:13,479
- Well, thank you.
- My pleasure.

474
00:47:14,273 --> 00:47:17,942
That'll be $23.75.

475
00:47:20,279 --> 00:47:23,322
My, my, my!
Where did you get all that money?

476
00:47:25,159 --> 00:47:27,452
I have a lot of grandmothers.

477
00:47:28,036 --> 00:47:30,079
Well, that explains it.

478
00:47:31,874 --> 00:47:36,252
This is a really nice store, one of the finer
toy dealerships I've ever visited in my life.

479
00:47:36,336 --> 00:47:39,756
- Well, thank you.
- This Mr. Duncan must be a pretty nice guy

480
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:43,092
letting all the kids come into his store
and play with all his toys.

481
00:47:43,177 --> 00:47:45,178
Most toy stores prohibit that, you know.

482
00:47:45,262 --> 00:47:46,596
- Is that so?
- Yep.

483
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:53,019
Well, he loves kids. As a matter of fact,
all the money the store takes in today,

484
00:47:53,562 --> 00:47:57,023
Mr. Duncan is donating it
to the children's hospital.

485
00:47:57,107 --> 00:48:02,570
And the day after Christmas, we empty
out all the money in the cash register

486
00:48:02,654 --> 00:48:06,115
and Mr. Duncan just takes it
right down to the hospital.

487
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:10,536
- That's very generous of him.
- Well, children bring him a lot ofjoy.

488
00:48:11,371 --> 00:48:14,290
As they do to everyone
who appreciates them.

489
00:48:20,255 --> 00:48:23,966
I'm not supposed to spend this money,
but I have $20 from shoveling snow

490
00:48:24,051 --> 00:48:27,470
in a jar in our garage
where my older brother can't find it.

491
00:48:27,554 --> 00:48:29,639
So I can pay my mother back with that.

492
00:48:29,723 --> 00:48:33,893
So you can give this to Mr. Duncan.
The hospital needs it more than I do.

493
00:48:33,977 --> 00:48:38,898
Besides, I'm probably gonna spend it
on stuff that'll rot my teeth and my mind.

494
00:48:41,401 --> 00:48:44,070
That's very sweet of you.

495
00:48:45,572 --> 00:48:47,782
You see that tree there?

496
00:48:47,866 --> 00:48:51,494
Well, to show our appreciation
for your generosity,

497
00:48:51,578 --> 00:48:56,165
I'm going to let you select an object from
that tree that you can take home with you.

498
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:58,751
- For free?
- Yeah.

499
00:48:58,836 --> 00:49:01,921
- May I make a suggestion?
- Okay.

500
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:04,257
Take the turtledoves.

501
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,135
- I could have two?
- Well, two turtledoves.

502
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:12,890
And I'll tell you what you do.
You keep one,

503
00:49:12,975 --> 00:49:16,769
and you give the other one
to a very special person.

504
00:49:17,271 --> 00:49:21,983
You see, turtledoves are a symbol
of friendship and love.

505
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:26,779
Now, as long as each of you
have your turtledove,

506
00:49:26,864 --> 00:49:29,657
you'll be friends forever.

507
00:49:29,741 --> 00:49:33,911
Wow! I never knew that.
I thought they were just part of a song.

508
00:49:33,996 --> 00:49:38,332
They are, and for that very special reason.

509
00:49:38,417 --> 00:49:41,294
Wow! Thanks.

510
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:45,047
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you, too.

511
00:49:45,132 --> 00:49:48,968
Be sure to bundle up if you go outside.
It's a little nippy.

512
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:51,178
Thank you, I'll do that.

513
00:50:28,216 --> 00:50:29,842
Well, where to?

514
00:50:30,385 --> 00:50:34,180
Well, you promised you'd take me
to the Central Park Zoo.

515
00:50:41,688 --> 00:50:44,357
Hey! Look who it is, Marv.

516
00:50:47,986 --> 00:50:50,071
Come on. Let's get him.

517
00:50:52,366 --> 00:50:53,491
Hey!

518
00:50:55,452 --> 00:50:56,953
Hiya, pal.

519
00:51:16,098 --> 00:51:17,473
Come on!

520
00:51:32,739 --> 00:51:33,990
Hey!

521
00:51:39,246 --> 00:51:41,080
Hey! Watch it, man!

522
00:51:43,125 --> 00:51:45,167
Buy now and avoid the Christmas rush.

523
00:51:45,252 --> 00:51:48,879
Two for $5, two for $5. Four for 10.

524
00:51:48,964 --> 00:51:51,674
- All right, kiddo.
- There he is!

525
00:51:51,758 --> 00:51:53,592
All right, kiddo!

526
00:51:53,677 --> 00:51:55,219
- Thanks.
- Merry Christmas.

527
00:51:55,303 --> 00:51:56,971
- Hey, hey!
- Whoa!

528
00:51:57,889 --> 00:51:59,223
Excuse me!

529
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:33,549
Yes!

530
00:52:34,176 --> 00:52:36,635
- Thank you for your suggestion.
- My duty, my pleasure.

531
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,054
Bye now.

532
00:52:49,357 --> 00:52:52,068
You got to help me!
There's two guys after me!

533
00:52:52,152 --> 00:52:53,486
What's the matter?

534
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:58,407
Store wouldn't take
your stolen credit card?

535
00:52:59,242 --> 00:53:02,495
Let's see what the police
have to say about this.

536
00:53:07,918 --> 00:53:09,710
Get up! Get up!

537
00:53:11,046 --> 00:53:13,130
Come on! Let's go get him!

538
00:53:14,674 --> 00:53:17,510
Get back here, you little thief!

539
00:53:20,222 --> 00:53:22,014
Stop that child!

540
00:53:25,185 --> 00:53:26,519
Grab him!

541
00:53:41,034 --> 00:53:42,701
You little...

542
00:53:45,163 --> 00:53:47,540
I've committed credit card fraud.

543
00:53:47,624 --> 00:53:49,333
Get me security!

544
00:53:49,918 --> 00:53:52,711
We've got to stop that delinquent!

545
00:53:53,046 --> 00:53:55,339
Come along, Cedric.

546
00:54:14,526 --> 00:54:17,570
I've had enough of this vacation.
I'm going home.

547
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,916
Hold it right there.

548
00:54:32,294 --> 00:54:34,503
This is the concierge, sir.

549
00:54:35,297 --> 00:54:39,675
I knew it was you.
I could smell you getting off the elevator.

550
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:44,930
You was here last night, too, wasn't you?

551
00:54:46,391 --> 00:54:49,393
Yes, sir, I was.

552
00:54:50,145 --> 00:54:53,731
You was here,
and you was smooching with my brother!

553
00:54:55,817 --> 00:54:59,528
I'm... I'm afraid you're mistaken, sir.

554
00:54:59,613 --> 00:55:02,865
Don't give me that.
You been smooching with everybody!

555
00:55:02,949 --> 00:55:07,536
Snuffy, Al, Leo,
Little Mo with the gimpy leg,

556
00:55:07,621 --> 00:55:09,872
Cheeks, Bony Bob, Cliff...

557
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:15,169
No!

558
00:55:16,296 --> 00:55:17,880
It's a lie!

559
00:55:17,964 --> 00:55:20,674
I could go on forever, baby.

560
00:55:20,759 --> 00:55:25,679
I'm terribly sorry, sir,
but I'm afraid you're mistaken.

561
00:55:25,764 --> 00:55:27,723
We're looking for a young man.

562
00:55:27,807 --> 00:55:30,517
All right. I believe you,

563
00:55:30,602 --> 00:55:32,519
but my Tommy gun don't!

564
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:36,649
Get down on your knees
and tell me you love me.

565
00:55:39,361 --> 00:55:41,153
On your knees.

566
00:55:49,663 --> 00:55:51,664
I love you.

567
00:55:55,293 --> 00:55:57,711
You got to do better than that!

568
00:55:58,755 --> 00:56:00,839
- I love you!
- I love you!

569
00:56:02,509 --> 00:56:05,886
Maybe I'm off my hinges, but I believe you.

570
00:56:05,971 --> 00:56:08,389
That's why I'm gonna let you go.

571
00:56:09,182 --> 00:56:11,892
I'm going to give you to the count of three

572
00:56:11,977 --> 00:56:18,649
to get your lousy, lying, lowdown,
four-flushing carcass out my door!

573
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,986
- One...
- Open up the door!

574
00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:23,487
Two,

575
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:38,752
three!

576
00:56:39,254 --> 00:56:41,964
Merry Christmas, you filthy animal.

577
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:46,885
And a happy New Year.

578
00:56:49,389 --> 00:56:52,808
Stay in your rooms! This is an emergency!

579
00:56:52,892 --> 00:56:55,853
There's an insane guest with a gun!

580
00:57:06,698 --> 00:57:09,241
No!

581
00:57:11,411 --> 00:57:13,203
Come to Papa!

582
00:57:15,415 --> 00:57:19,168
Round trip to Miami. What's the matter,
get on the wrong plane, squirt?

583
00:57:19,252 --> 00:57:20,794
Looks like you won't be needing this, kid.

584
00:57:21,296 --> 00:57:24,131
American don't fly
to the promised land, little buddy.

585
00:57:24,215 --> 00:57:25,507
Come on!

586
00:57:27,469 --> 00:57:31,805
We spent nine months in jail thinking
we had the worst luck in the universe.

587
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:33,390
We were wrong, little buddy.

588
00:57:33,475 --> 00:57:35,851
We're busted out of the clink,
and we're doing fine.

589
00:57:35,935 --> 00:57:39,229
We're gonna be doing even better because
we're not robbing houses anymore.

590
00:57:39,314 --> 00:57:40,898
Now we're robbing toy stores.

591
00:57:40,982 --> 00:57:44,068
At midnight tonight,
we're hitting Duncan's Toy Chest.

592
00:57:44,152 --> 00:57:46,070
Five floors of cash.

593
00:57:46,154 --> 00:57:48,322
Then after that, we grab
a couple of phony passports...

594
00:57:48,406 --> 00:57:51,950
- Marv! Marv, you want to shut up?
- What's the difference?

595
00:57:52,035 --> 00:57:57,456
He's not going to talk to anybody
except maybe a fish. Or the undertaker.

596
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:02,836
Let's just get him to the subway tunnel.
I'll feel a lot better once we get him on ice.

597
00:58:04,506 --> 00:58:06,048
I've got a gun in my pocket.

598
00:58:06,132 --> 00:58:10,677
You open your mouth, and you'll be
spitting gum out through your forehead.

599
00:58:30,698 --> 00:58:32,324
Well, hello.

600
00:58:35,453 --> 00:58:38,247
- He did it!
- Did what?

601
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:42,584
Thanks!

602
00:58:45,672 --> 00:58:48,090
- Get him, will you!
- He went in the park.

603
00:58:48,174 --> 00:58:50,968
What are you doing flirting? Get him.

604
00:59:25,044 --> 00:59:26,587
Over there!

605
00:59:31,092 --> 00:59:33,093
- Quit it! Hey!
- Creep!

606
00:59:34,179 --> 00:59:36,555
- Give me that!
- What are you doing?

607
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:38,140
- Hey, Harry.
- What?

608
00:59:38,224 --> 00:59:39,600
- I got him.
- Wait, let me see.

609
00:59:39,684 --> 00:59:43,187
That ain't him. Get down. Put him down.
Put him down. That ain't him.

610
00:59:43,271 --> 00:59:45,314
We should've shot him
when we had the chance.

611
00:59:45,398 --> 00:59:47,733
I hate pulling a job,
knowing that little creep is on the loose.

612
00:59:47,817 --> 00:59:50,486
What can he do? He's a kid.
Kids are helpless.

613
00:59:50,570 --> 00:59:52,946
- Not this kid.
- Yeah, but this time he doesn't have

614
00:59:53,031 --> 00:59:56,116
a house full of dangerous goodies
to get us with.

615
00:59:56,201 --> 01:00:00,245
He's in the Park. He's alone.
Kids are scared of the Park.

616
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:03,499
Yeah. Grown men come in the Park
and don't leave alive.

617
01:00:03,583 --> 01:00:04,750
Yeah.

618
01:00:05,418 --> 01:00:07,586
Good luck, little fella.

619
01:00:18,264 --> 01:00:22,226
I want to go home. Mom, where are you?

620
01:00:52,507 --> 01:00:54,132
Turn that down!

621
01:00:55,969 --> 01:00:57,219
- Hello?
- Kate McCallister, please.

622
01:00:57,303 --> 01:00:59,054
- This is she.
- Ma'am, we found your son.

623
01:00:59,138 --> 01:01:00,722
- Oh, my God!
- What?

624
01:01:00,807 --> 01:01:02,432
- It's the police. They know where Kevin is.
- What?

625
01:01:02,517 --> 01:01:04,393
- Where?
- He's in New York City.

626
01:01:04,477 --> 01:01:06,603
- He's in New York!
- New York?

627
01:01:08,022 --> 01:01:09,815
...your husband's credit cards...
- What?

628
01:01:09,899 --> 01:01:11,316
Well, I'm sure he was scared.
He's not a troublemaker.

629
01:01:12,026 --> 01:01:13,443
- What? What?
- Ma'am, the New York police...

630
01:01:13,528 --> 01:01:15,571
- Just a second. Please hold.
- Yes, I'll hold...

631
01:01:15,655 --> 01:01:18,282
He used your credit card
to check into the Plaza Hotel.

632
01:01:18,366 --> 01:01:20,242
- Do they still have him?
- Do they have him?

633
01:01:20,326 --> 01:01:22,703
- No, the police are still looking for him.
- Damn it!

634
01:01:22,787 --> 01:01:24,162
Get to New York
as soon as possible, ma'am.

635
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:26,331
Yeah, okay, we're on the next flight out.
Thank you.

636
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:27,874
We're going to New York, move it!

637
01:01:27,959 --> 01:01:30,377
- Yes!
- Party time!

638
01:01:30,461 --> 01:01:33,088
He ran away from the hotel
when they questioned him about the card.

639
01:01:33,172 --> 01:01:34,923
He must be so scared, Peter!

640
01:01:35,008 --> 01:01:37,009
I wonder if he'd know enough
to go to my brother's place?

641
01:01:37,093 --> 01:01:39,803
- Aren't they in Paris?
- Maybe they have a house sitter.

642
01:01:39,887 --> 01:01:41,680
I thought you said they were renovating?

643
01:02:21,721 --> 01:02:28,560
Hello? Uncle Rob! Aunt Georgette!
Anybody home?

644
01:02:29,896 --> 01:02:32,814
Hello! Anybody home?

645
01:02:33,274 --> 01:02:35,901
It's me, your favorite nephew, Kevin!

646
01:02:36,819 --> 01:02:40,238
Uncle Rob! Aunt Georgette!

647
01:03:23,866 --> 01:03:25,701
Watch it, kid!

648
01:03:31,666 --> 01:03:35,961
Hey, you looking for somebody
to read you a bedtime story?

649
01:03:41,759 --> 01:03:43,176
Taxi!

650
01:03:56,107 --> 01:03:58,650
Boy, it's scary out there.

651
01:03:59,986 --> 01:04:02,320
Ain't much better in here, kid.

652
01:04:29,015 --> 01:04:32,392
I don't want to ever take a vacation
like this again.

653
01:05:02,548 --> 01:05:04,424
Where did all you guys come from?

654
01:05:04,509 --> 01:05:06,468
I don't know if I have
enough for everybody.

655
01:05:06,552 --> 01:05:08,678
How hungry are you guys?

656
01:05:10,389 --> 01:05:12,599
You guys ate all my food.

657
01:06:11,659 --> 01:06:16,913
Look, I'm sorry I screamed in your face.
You were just trying to help me, right?

658
01:06:20,293 --> 01:06:22,294
I'm Kevin McCallister.

659
01:06:23,045 --> 01:06:25,130
Your birds are real nice.

660
01:06:25,798 --> 01:06:29,676
I've seen you before.
You had pigeons all over you.

661
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:34,222
At first, you look kind of scary,
but when I think about it, it's not so bad.

662
01:06:34,307 --> 01:06:37,851
They must be all over you
'cause they like you.

663
01:06:38,686 --> 01:06:42,314
If I'm bothering you, I can leave.
Am I bothering you?

664
01:06:44,191 --> 01:06:45,358
No.

665
01:06:46,402 --> 01:06:48,987
Good. I'm not a pain in the butt?

666
01:06:51,032 --> 01:06:52,198
No.

667
01:06:56,829 --> 01:07:01,291
Will those pigeons come back
on their own or do you have to call them?

668
01:07:11,344 --> 01:07:13,261
Give me your hand.

669
01:07:16,724 --> 01:07:18,558
They can hear it.

670
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:37,535
This is great!

671
01:07:41,207 --> 01:07:42,749
It's pretty cold out.

672
01:07:42,833 --> 01:07:47,963
I could sure go for a cup of hot chocolate.
How about you? My treat.

673
01:07:52,635 --> 01:07:55,387
I'd hate to spend Christmas Eve
in such a park.

674
01:07:55,471 --> 01:07:57,639
Can we go someplace warm?

675
01:07:57,723 --> 01:08:00,058
Yes. I know a place.

676
01:08:47,481 --> 01:08:49,399
Nice music.

677
01:08:50,901 --> 01:08:53,236
This place is great.

678
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:56,531
I've heard the world's
great music from here.

679
01:08:57,908 --> 01:09:03,621
Ella Fitzgerald. Count Basie.
Frank Sinatra. Luciano Pavarotti.

680
01:09:09,795 --> 01:09:12,630
So, do you bring your friends up here?

681
01:09:13,758 --> 01:09:16,760
- I haven't got many friends.
- Sorry.

682
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:20,722
I'm like the birds I care for.

683
01:09:21,599 --> 01:09:25,727
People pass me in the street.
They see me but they try to ignore me.

684
01:09:25,811 --> 01:09:28,438
They prefer I wasn't part of their city.

685
01:09:28,522 --> 01:09:33,651
Yeah. It's sort of like that with my family.
I'm kind of the pigeon of the house

686
01:09:33,736 --> 01:09:36,029
just because I'm the youngest.

687
01:09:36,113 --> 01:09:38,490
Everyone fights for position.

688
01:09:38,574 --> 01:09:41,326
Everybody wants to be seen and heard.

689
01:09:41,952 --> 01:09:45,288
I guess so.
I'm seen and heard pretty much.

690
01:09:45,372 --> 01:09:48,333
But then I get sent to my room a lot, too.

691
01:09:50,711 --> 01:09:52,962
I wasn't always like this, you know.

692
01:09:53,047 --> 01:09:55,215
What were you like before?

693
01:09:56,175 --> 01:10:00,178
I had a job. I had a home. I had a family.

694
01:10:00,846 --> 01:10:06,309
- Did you have any kids?
- No. Oh, I wanted them.

695
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:10,772
But the man I loved
fell out of love with me.

696
01:10:11,857 --> 01:10:13,650
That broke my heart.

697
01:10:14,151 --> 01:10:18,947
And whenever the chance to be loved
came along again, I ran away from it.

698
01:10:20,324 --> 01:10:22,408
I stopped trusting people.

699
01:10:22,493 --> 01:10:26,788
No offense, but that seems like
sort of a dumb thing to do.

700
01:10:26,872 --> 01:10:30,125
I was afraid of getting
my heart broken again.

701
01:10:30,209 --> 01:10:32,836
You see, sometimes
you can trust a person,

702
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:36,464
and then, when things are down,
they forget about you.

703
01:10:37,675 --> 01:10:39,467
Maybe they're just too busy.

704
01:10:39,552 --> 01:10:43,471
Maybe they don't forget about you,
but they forget to remember you.

705
01:10:43,556 --> 01:10:47,559
I don't think people mean to forget.
I think it just happens.

706
01:10:47,643 --> 01:10:52,438
My grandfather says if my head wasn't
screwed on, I'd leave it on the school bus.

707
01:10:52,523 --> 01:10:56,526
I'm just afraid if I do trust someone,
I'll get my heart broken again.

708
01:10:56,610 --> 01:10:58,111
I understand that.

709
01:10:58,195 --> 01:11:00,655
I used to have this
really nice pair of rollerblades.

710
01:11:00,739 --> 01:11:04,993
I was afraid if I wore them, I'd wreck them.
So I kept them in a box.

711
01:11:05,077 --> 01:11:06,786
- Do you know what happened?
- No.

712
01:11:06,871 --> 01:11:10,081
I outgrew them.
I never wore them once outside.

713
01:11:10,166 --> 01:11:13,334
I just wore them in my room
a couple times.

714
01:11:13,419 --> 01:11:18,089
A person's heart and a person's feelings
are very different than skates.

715
01:11:18,174 --> 01:11:20,300
Well, they're kind of the same thing.

716
01:11:20,384 --> 01:11:24,012
If you aren't going to use your heart, then
what's the difference if it gets broken?

717
01:11:24,096 --> 01:11:27,765
If you just keep it to yourself,
maybe it'll be like my rollerblades.

718
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:31,352
When you do decide to try it,
it won't be any good.

719
01:11:31,437 --> 01:11:34,772
You should take a chance.
Got nothing to lose.

720
01:11:35,774 --> 01:11:37,942
A bit of truth in there somewhere.

721
01:11:38,027 --> 01:11:42,697
I think so. Your heart might
still be broken, but it isn't gone.

722
01:11:42,781 --> 01:11:45,700
If it was gone, you wouldn't be this nice.

723
01:11:46,285 --> 01:11:48,328
Thank you.

724
01:11:49,914 --> 01:11:55,251
Do you know that it's been a couple
of years since I've talked to anybody?

725
01:11:56,128 --> 01:11:58,087
That's okay. You're really good at it.

726
01:11:58,172 --> 01:12:01,132
You're not boring.
You don't mumble or spit when you talk.

727
01:12:01,217 --> 01:12:03,176
You should do it more often.

728
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:07,889
I think you just have to wear an outfit
that doesn't have pigeon poop on it.

729
01:12:09,808 --> 01:12:13,353
I have been working very hard
at keeping people away, haven't I?

730
01:12:13,437 --> 01:12:16,147
I always think I'll have
a lot of fun if I'm alone,

731
01:12:16,232 --> 01:12:19,067
but when I'm alone,
it isn't that much fun at all.

732
01:12:19,151 --> 01:12:21,861
I don't care how much
people bug me sometimes,

733
01:12:21,946 --> 01:12:25,365
I'd rather be with somebody
than by myself.

734
01:12:25,449 --> 01:12:28,910
So what are you doing running around the
streets on Christmas Eve on your own?

735
01:12:28,994 --> 01:12:31,120
Did you get into trouble?

736
01:12:31,455 --> 01:12:34,040
- Yeah.
- You've done something wrong?

737
01:12:34,124 --> 01:12:37,043
A lot of things.

738
01:12:38,128 --> 01:12:41,965
Did you know that a good deed
erases a bad deed?

739
01:12:42,049 --> 01:12:44,968
It's getting pretty late.
I don't know if I'll have enough time

740
01:12:45,052 --> 01:12:48,221
to do all the good deeds I need
to erase all the bad ones I did.

741
01:12:48,305 --> 01:12:51,766
Well, it's Christmas Eve.
Good deeds count for extra tonight.

742
01:12:51,850 --> 01:12:54,602
- They do?
- Of course they do.

743
01:12:54,687 --> 01:12:57,438
So what you must do now is you must
think of the most important thing

744
01:12:57,523 --> 01:13:00,775
that you can do for others
and go and do it.

745
01:13:00,859 --> 01:13:03,945
Just follow the star in your own heart.

746
01:13:05,489 --> 01:13:06,739
Okay.

747
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:11,369
It's getting pretty late. I'd better get going.

748
01:13:17,668 --> 01:13:21,212
If I don't see you again,
I hope everything turns out okay.

749
01:13:21,297 --> 01:13:23,339
Thank you.

750
01:13:23,424 --> 01:13:26,509
- Say goodbye to your birds for me.
- I will.

751
01:13:34,935 --> 01:13:37,895
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

752
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:41,316
If you need somebody to trust,
it can be me.

753
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:44,319
I won't forget to remember you.

754
01:13:44,403 --> 01:13:47,030
Don't make promises you can't keep.

755
01:14:45,756 --> 01:14:47,840
All the money in the cash registers,

756
01:14:47,925 --> 01:14:52,053
Mr. Duncan is going to donate
to the Children's Hospital.

757
01:14:52,137 --> 01:14:55,765
At midnight tonight,
we're hitting Duncan's Toy Chest.

758
01:14:55,849 --> 01:15:00,520
You can mess with a lot of things, but
you can't mess with kids on Christmas.

759
01:17:21,578 --> 01:17:25,373
We'd like to offer you
a complimentary suite while you're here.

760
01:17:25,457 --> 01:17:29,043
It's a penthouse with a view of the Park.
I think you'll find it satisfactory.

761
01:17:29,127 --> 01:17:33,047
It was recently vacated
by the Countess of Worcestershire.

762
01:17:33,131 --> 01:17:36,175
What kind of hotel allows
a child to check in alone?

763
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:38,719
The boy had a very convincing story.

764
01:17:38,804 --> 01:17:41,681
What kind of idiots
do you have working here?

765
01:17:41,765 --> 01:17:43,724
The finest in New York.

766
01:17:44,643 --> 01:17:47,270
Well, I mean, when you discovered
that the credit card was stolen...

767
01:17:47,354 --> 01:17:49,230
I made the discovery.

768
01:17:49,314 --> 01:17:51,732
Why did you let him leave?

769
01:17:51,817 --> 01:17:55,278
- We attempted to confront him, he ran.
- You scared him away.

770
01:17:55,362 --> 01:17:58,281
It's Christmas Eve, and because of you,
our child is lost

771
01:17:58,365 --> 01:18:01,242
in one of the biggest cities in the world.

772
01:18:03,161 --> 01:18:06,122
Now could you take our family
and our luggage up to the room, please.

773
01:18:06,206 --> 01:18:09,250
- Yes, sir!
- Run along, Cedric.

774
01:18:09,334 --> 01:18:10,960
I'm going to go down to
the police station and make sure

775
01:18:11,044 --> 01:18:12,753
that they're doing everything
in their power to find Kevin.

776
01:18:12,838 --> 01:18:14,589
I want you to stay here
with Frank, Leslie and the kids.

777
01:18:14,673 --> 01:18:17,133
- No, I'm going out to look for him.
- What?

778
01:18:17,217 --> 01:18:19,844
With all due respect, madam,
your son is lost

779
01:18:19,928 --> 01:18:22,763
in one of the biggest cities in the world.

780
01:18:22,848 --> 01:18:25,182
Could you stay out of this please?

781
01:18:25,267 --> 01:18:27,351
- As you wish.
- Thank you.

782
01:18:27,436 --> 01:18:29,687
I don't think it's a good idea
for you to start running around

783
01:18:29,771 --> 01:18:33,524
- all over New York City all by yourself.
- I think if our son can do it, I can do it.

784
01:18:33,609 --> 01:18:34,775
- Kate...
- Peter, I'll be fine.

785
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:39,363
The way I'm feeling right now, no mugger
or murderer would dare mess with me.

786
01:18:39,448 --> 01:18:43,659
Madam, there are hundreds of parasites
out there armed to the teeth!

787
01:18:45,495 --> 01:18:48,539
Do bundle up. It's awfully cold outside.

788
01:19:23,116 --> 01:19:25,493
Marv. Marv. Come on, let's go.

789
01:19:46,807 --> 01:19:49,308
Marv. Crowbars up!

790
01:19:55,816 --> 01:19:57,942
Merry Christmas, Harry!

791
01:20:01,947 --> 01:20:04,323
Happy Hanukkah, Marv!

792
01:20:13,959 --> 01:20:16,877
Oh, this is more money
than I can even count!

793
01:20:16,962 --> 01:20:21,173
It makes you wonder why we spent
so much time robbing private homes.

794
01:20:34,813 --> 01:20:37,898
The amazing thing is,
we're fugitives from the law,

795
01:20:37,983 --> 01:20:42,653
we're up to our elbows in cash and
there's nobody that even knows about it.

796
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:48,200
He's back!

797
01:20:49,494 --> 01:20:52,621
- He took our picture!
- How did my hair look?

798
01:20:59,045 --> 01:21:01,505
This is it. No turning back.

799
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:05,009
Another Christmas in the trenches.

800
01:21:06,219 --> 01:21:08,220
No!

801
01:21:13,685 --> 01:21:14,894
Wow.

802
01:21:14,978 --> 01:21:19,356
That's it! Get the money! Get the money!
I'll kill him! That little...

803
01:21:27,157 --> 01:21:30,743
- I'm coming, Harry!
- Marv!

804
01:21:38,376 --> 01:21:39,794
Harry?

805
01:21:42,380 --> 01:21:45,424
Harry! That was incredible.

806
01:21:49,304 --> 01:21:51,931
- I twisted my ankle on that board there.
- Where is he?

807
01:21:52,015 --> 01:21:54,225
Hey, guys! Smile!

808
01:21:57,020 --> 01:21:58,687
Come on! Come on!

809
01:21:58,772 --> 01:22:01,607
- Help me.
- I got you. I got you.

810
01:22:29,511 --> 01:22:30,803
Taxi!

811
01:22:36,601 --> 01:22:38,269
Times Square.

812
01:22:59,833 --> 01:23:01,792
Where'd he go?

813
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:04,628
I'm up here! Come and get me!

814
01:23:06,673 --> 01:23:09,758
- Let's kill!
- Hold on, pea-brain.

815
01:23:09,843 --> 01:23:12,177
We got busted last time
because we underestimated

816
01:23:12,262 --> 01:23:13,846
that little bundle of misery.

817
01:23:13,930 --> 01:23:16,473
This ain't like the last time.
This ain't his house.

818
01:23:16,558 --> 01:23:19,602
The kid's running scared.
He ain't got a plan.

819
01:23:20,353 --> 01:23:22,605
May I do the thinking, please?

820
01:23:24,190 --> 01:23:25,816
Thank you.

821
01:23:27,777 --> 01:23:30,404
- Sonny!
- Yes?

822
01:23:30,488 --> 01:23:34,617
Nothing would thrill me
more greatly than to shoot you.

823
01:23:34,701 --> 01:23:39,788
Knocking off a youngster ain't going
to mean all that much to me. Understand?

824
01:23:39,873 --> 01:23:43,584
But since we're in a hurry,
I'll make a deal with you.

825
01:23:43,668 --> 01:23:48,297
You throw down your camera
and we won't hurt you.

826
01:23:48,381 --> 01:23:52,301
You'll never hear from us again. Okay?

827
01:23:52,677 --> 01:23:57,848
- You promise?
- I cross my heart and hope to die.

828
01:23:58,683 --> 01:24:00,476
Okay!

829
01:24:05,774 --> 01:24:08,359
Okay, kid, give it to me.

830
01:24:17,369 --> 01:24:18,869
Direct hit!

831
01:24:24,417 --> 01:24:27,211
How many fingers am I holding up, Marv?

832
01:24:29,172 --> 01:24:30,547
Eight?

833
01:24:33,802 --> 01:24:37,471
Okay, kid. You want to throw bricks?
Go ahead, throw another one.

834
01:24:37,555 --> 01:24:39,139
Don't do that!

835
01:24:43,395 --> 01:24:47,439
If you can't do any better than that, kid,
you're going to lose.

836
01:24:48,608 --> 01:24:51,068
Harry, no.

837
01:24:57,742 --> 01:24:59,827
You got any more?

838
01:25:02,414 --> 01:25:05,082
Come on, Marv. Get up. He don't have
any more bricks. He's out of them.

839
01:25:11,965 --> 01:25:19,596
What?

840
01:25:22,475 --> 01:25:25,269
That did it! Nobody throws bricks
at me and gets away with it.

841
01:25:25,353 --> 01:25:29,356
Come on, Marv. Get up.
You go this way. I'm going round the back.

842
01:25:33,445 --> 01:25:40,909
Harry?

843
01:28:06,764 --> 01:28:09,766
Harry! I've reached the top!

844
01:29:03,029 --> 01:29:05,697
You gotta do better than this, kid.

845
01:29:30,056 --> 01:29:32,683
Wow! What a hole.

846
01:29:55,039 --> 01:29:56,373
Whoa!

847
01:33:41,224 --> 01:33:42,766
Harry.

848
01:34:03,663 --> 01:34:05,372
I'm coming up!

849
01:34:20,221 --> 01:34:22,514
I'm going to murder that kid!

850
01:34:40,616 --> 01:34:41,825
Yes!

851
01:34:48,708 --> 01:34:50,000
Whoa.

852
01:34:58,718 --> 01:35:00,969
Whoa, whoa!

853
01:35:11,522 --> 01:35:12,772
Hey!

854
01:35:13,149 --> 01:35:16,192
Don't you know a kid always wins
against two idiots?

855
01:35:16,277 --> 01:35:18,903
Harry! He's in the living room!

856
01:35:20,072 --> 01:35:21,990
He went up the ladder!

857
01:35:39,383 --> 01:35:42,469
I'm coming, Harry. I'm coming.

858
01:35:47,892 --> 01:35:49,684
Harry! Harry!

859
01:35:51,145 --> 01:35:55,231
You didn't lose any teeth!
Come on, he went to the second floor.

860
01:35:55,691 --> 01:35:58,401
Hey! Why don't you guys try the stairs?

861
01:35:58,903 --> 01:36:00,362
Right.

862
01:36:02,907 --> 01:36:05,116
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

863
01:36:05,201 --> 01:36:08,161
Don't you remember
what happened last year?

864
01:36:08,245 --> 01:36:10,372
- No.
- Watch this.

865
01:36:11,749 --> 01:36:13,750
Let's get him!

866
01:36:18,714 --> 01:36:21,466
He busted me right in my mouth, Marv!

867
01:36:22,510 --> 01:36:24,010
That's one.

868
01:36:24,095 --> 01:36:28,014
Don't worry, Harry. I'll get him.

869
01:36:35,356 --> 01:36:37,440
Right in the schnoz.

870
01:36:38,526 --> 01:36:41,111
That's two. Come on, let's get him.

871
01:36:53,290 --> 01:36:55,625
That's three.

872
01:37:01,924 --> 01:37:03,007
No.

873
01:37:05,302 --> 01:37:06,886
That's four.

874
01:37:12,101 --> 01:37:14,686
- Come on, Harry.
- Marv, are you sure this is safe?

875
01:37:14,770 --> 01:37:20,108
Oh yeah. Yep, I've worked all the kinks out.
It's solid as a rock.

876
01:37:37,585 --> 01:37:41,087
- Like a rock, huh, Marv?
- Hey? Do you guys give up?

877
01:37:41,172 --> 01:37:43,923
- Have you had enough pain?
- Never!

878
01:37:55,770 --> 01:37:58,521
You better say every prayer
you ever heard before, kid!

879
01:37:58,606 --> 01:38:02,192
I hope your parents got you
a tombstone for Christmas.

880
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:07,947
- Where'd he go?
- I'm up here and I'm really scared.

881
01:38:18,083 --> 01:38:20,043
What's that sound?

882
01:38:39,980 --> 01:38:44,526
That was the sound of a tool chest
falling down the stairs.

883
01:38:51,367 --> 01:38:52,742
Yes!

884
01:39:27,611 --> 01:39:29,404
Over there!

885
01:39:29,488 --> 01:39:32,949
I don't care if I get the chair,
I'm killing that kid!

886
01:39:34,910 --> 01:39:36,870
Surrender, kid!

887
01:39:37,371 --> 01:39:40,665
- He vanished.
- I'm down here, you big horse's ass!

888
01:39:44,420 --> 01:39:47,046
- Whoa.
- Nice night for a neck injury!

889
01:39:48,549 --> 01:39:50,884
Suck brick, kid!

890
01:39:56,849 --> 01:39:59,684
- Come on, Marv.
- Oh, I don't know.

891
01:40:00,185 --> 01:40:02,145
I said, come on.

892
01:40:03,939 --> 01:40:06,316
Come on, you big sissy.

893
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:22,916
Harry? You wearing aftershave?

894
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:27,128
That's not aftershave. That's kerosene.
The rope is soaked in it.

895
01:40:28,088 --> 01:40:31,174
Now, why would anybody
soak a rope in kerosene?

896
01:40:35,512 --> 01:40:37,263
Merry Christmas.

897
01:40:37,973 --> 01:40:39,307
Go up!

898
01:41:14,259 --> 01:41:15,885
Get off me!

899
01:41:39,159 --> 01:41:40,702
Get the bag!

900
01:41:41,453 --> 01:41:44,580
Hello, the two guys who robbed
Duncan's Toy Chest are in the park.

901
01:41:44,665 --> 01:41:49,210
Central Park West, 95th Street.
Look for fireworks. Hurry, they got a gun.

902
01:41:56,010 --> 01:42:00,221
Hey, I'm down here. Better come
and get me before I call the cops.

903
01:42:15,362 --> 01:42:18,406
My, how the tables have turned.

904
01:42:18,490 --> 01:42:20,825
How do you like the ice, kid?

905
01:42:25,622 --> 01:42:28,416
Let's go for a little stroll in the park.

906
01:42:45,893 --> 01:42:48,227
Give me that bag. Give me it!

907
01:42:52,858 --> 01:42:55,818
Hey, these'll look great in the photo album.

908
01:42:56,570 --> 01:43:00,615
You may've won the battle, little dude,
but you lost the war.

909
01:43:01,158 --> 01:43:04,911
You ought not have messed with us, pal.
We're dangerous.

910
01:43:10,918 --> 01:43:12,960
- Harry?
- Shut up!

911
01:43:17,466 --> 01:43:21,135
- Harry.
- Shut up! I want to enjoy this.

912
01:43:21,762 --> 01:43:26,182
- Something's wrong. Let's get out of here!
- Shut up, I said!

913
01:43:28,435 --> 01:43:31,270
I never made it to the 6th grade, kid,

914
01:43:31,355 --> 01:43:34,857
and it doesn't look like
you're going to, either.

915
01:43:35,400 --> 01:43:37,151
Let him go!

916
01:43:37,236 --> 01:43:38,986
Kevin, run!

917
01:43:40,531 --> 01:43:44,659
Shoot her! Shoot her! Shoot her!

918
01:43:44,743 --> 01:43:47,036
I'm trying to shoot her!

919
01:44:02,636 --> 01:44:03,970
Run, Marv!

920
01:44:26,243 --> 01:44:28,161
Bye! Thanks.

921
01:44:53,896 --> 01:44:56,439
Jesus, looks like the 4th of July!

922
01:44:56,523 --> 01:44:58,107
- Okay, let's go.
- We'll take the bridge.

923
01:44:58,192 --> 01:45:01,277
You guys get the tunnel.
Let's go. Come on!

924
01:45:08,785 --> 01:45:10,620
Oh, my God!

925
01:45:20,964 --> 01:45:22,298
All right, guys, let's go, huh?

926
01:45:22,382 --> 01:45:25,635
- Come on, on your feet.
- Take it easy.

927
01:45:26,511 --> 01:45:27,553
What is this stuff?

928
01:45:28,972 --> 01:45:31,390
You guys should've started earlier.

929
01:45:31,475 --> 01:45:33,893
The prisoners have
already exchanged gifts.

930
01:45:33,977 --> 01:45:35,811
We missed the presents?

931
01:45:35,896 --> 01:45:39,649
He made us hide out in the store so we
could steal all the kiddies' charity money.

932
01:45:39,733 --> 01:45:42,068
Shut up, Marv.

933
01:45:42,986 --> 01:45:45,947
Got the right to remain silent, you know.

934
01:45:46,031 --> 01:45:48,950
He's a little cranky. We just broke out
of prison a few days ago.

935
01:45:49,034 --> 01:45:51,661
Shut up, Marv! Jeez.

936
01:45:52,079 --> 01:45:53,996
- Get them out of here!
- All right, let's go.

937
01:45:54,081 --> 01:45:55,665
Remember, if this makes the papers,

938
01:45:55,749 --> 01:45:58,501
we're no longer the Wet Bandits,
we're the Sticky Bandits.

939
01:45:58,585 --> 01:46:00,253
We're not Sticky Bandits, shut up!

940
01:46:00,337 --> 01:46:02,672
- That's Sticky. That's S...
- Shut it.

941
01:46:02,756 --> 01:46:04,215
...T...

942
01:46:04,675 --> 01:46:06,175
- I.
...I...

943
01:46:18,522 --> 01:46:19,939
Well, Mr. Duncan, it's all over with.

944
01:46:20,023 --> 01:46:22,066
We apprehended the thieves
and we recovered your money.

945
01:46:22,150 --> 01:46:25,736
Good, I want to get that money over to the
Children's Hospital as soon as possible.

946
01:46:25,821 --> 01:46:29,282
- I'll handle it personally. My pleasure.
- Thank you very much.

947
01:46:29,366 --> 01:46:30,908
- Excuse me, Mr. Duncan.
- Yes.

948
01:46:30,993 --> 01:46:34,453
I found this note.
Looks like a kid broke your window.

949
01:46:51,388 --> 01:46:53,180
Turtledoves.

950
01:47:02,566 --> 01:47:06,360
Excuse me. I'm looking for my son.
He's this boy right here.

951
01:47:08,322 --> 01:47:10,489
Excuse me. Please help me.
This boy right here. Have you seen him?

952
01:47:10,574 --> 01:47:12,867
This one, he's... Please.

953
01:47:21,293 --> 01:47:23,169
I'm looking for my son.
Have you seen my son? He's...

954
01:47:23,253 --> 01:47:25,004
There. He's been missing for two days.

955
01:47:25,088 --> 01:47:29,008
- Well, have you filed a report, ma'am?
- Yes, of course we have.

956
01:47:29,968 --> 01:47:32,511
Then trust us. We'll handle it.

957
01:47:37,601 --> 01:47:39,435
But I'm his mother.

958
01:47:40,312 --> 01:47:44,440
I realize that, ma'am, but you're looking
for a needle in a haystack.

959
01:47:44,524 --> 01:47:47,943
- Do you have kids?
- Yes, ma'am.

960
01:47:48,028 --> 01:47:51,280
And what would you do
if one of them was missing?

961
01:47:52,282 --> 01:47:55,618
I'd probably be doing the same thing
you're doing.

962
01:47:56,161 --> 01:47:57,661
Thank you.

963
01:48:00,123 --> 01:48:04,293
Look, put yourself in your kid's shoes.
Where would you go? What would you do?

964
01:48:04,378 --> 01:48:07,963
Me? I'd probably be lying dead
in a gutter somewhere.

965
01:48:09,341 --> 01:48:14,053
Oh, but not Kevin. No. Kevin is
so much stronger and braver than I am.

966
01:48:15,555 --> 01:48:18,432
I know Kevin's fine. I'm sure he is. Fine.

967
01:48:19,726 --> 01:48:24,647
But he's still all by himself in a big city.
And he doesn't deserve that.

968
01:48:25,315 --> 01:48:29,819
He deserves to be at home with
his own family around his Christmas tree.

969
01:48:33,323 --> 01:48:36,659
Oh, dear God, I know where he is.

970
01:48:38,120 --> 01:48:40,663
I need to get to Rockefeller Center.

971
01:48:40,747 --> 01:48:42,915
- Hop in.
- Thank you.

972
01:48:47,337 --> 01:48:51,590
I know I don't deserve a Christmas
even if I did do a good deed.

973
01:48:52,509 --> 01:48:54,260
I don't want any presents.

974
01:48:54,344 --> 01:48:58,597
Instead, I want to take back
every mean thing I ever said to my family,

975
01:48:58,682 --> 01:49:01,434
even if they don't take back
the things that they said.

976
01:49:01,518 --> 01:49:05,354
I don't care. I love all of them.
Including Buzz.

977
01:49:06,481 --> 01:49:10,526
If it isn't possible I can see all of them,
could I just see my mother?

978
01:49:10,610 --> 01:49:15,281
I'll never want another thing
as long as I live. I just want my mother.

979
01:49:15,365 --> 01:49:19,326
I know I won't see her tonight,
but promise me I can see her again.

980
01:49:19,411 --> 01:49:21,370
Sometime. Anytime.

981
01:49:22,164 --> 01:49:25,749
Even if it's just once
and only for a couple of minutes.

982
01:49:25,834 --> 01:49:28,752
I just need to tell her I'm sorry.

983
01:49:36,470 --> 01:49:38,262
Kevin?

984
01:49:43,977 --> 01:49:45,394
Mom?

985
01:49:47,564 --> 01:49:49,899
Wow! That worked fast!

986
01:50:00,243 --> 01:50:01,911
Oh, Kevin.

987
01:50:03,330 --> 01:50:05,080
Mom, I'm sorry.

988
01:50:06,833 --> 01:50:08,918
I'm sorry, too.

989
01:50:21,056 --> 01:50:23,140
Merry Christmas, Mom.

990
01:50:25,060 --> 01:50:27,228
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

991
01:50:28,605 --> 01:50:31,273
Thank you. Let's go.

992
01:50:32,776 --> 01:50:34,193
How'd you know I was here?

993
01:50:34,277 --> 01:50:37,154
Well, I know you and Christmas trees,
and this is the biggest one around.

994
01:50:37,239 --> 01:50:39,532
- Where's everybody else?
- They're at the hotel.

995
01:50:39,616 --> 01:50:42,117
They didn't like palm trees either.

996
01:51:25,912 --> 01:51:28,372
Holy smokes, it's morning!

997
01:51:29,666 --> 01:51:31,875
It's Christmas morning, man.

998
01:51:33,253 --> 01:51:35,713
Fuller, don't get your hopes up.

999
01:51:36,715 --> 01:51:38,924
I don't think Santa Claus visits hotels.

1000
01:51:39,009 --> 01:51:42,595
Are you nuts? He's omnipresent.
He goes everywhere.

1001
01:51:44,723 --> 01:51:47,391
Hey, guys, wake up, it's Christmas!

1002
01:51:51,062 --> 01:51:53,230
- Mom! Dad! It's Christmas!
- What?

1003
01:52:05,869 --> 01:52:07,369
- Wow.
- Wow.

1004
01:52:07,829 --> 01:52:11,832
- Where'd it all come from?
- Mom! Dad! You got to see this!

1005
01:52:15,795 --> 01:52:17,796
- My gosh!
- Peter!

1006
01:52:17,881 --> 01:52:20,549
Are you sure we're in the right room?

1007
01:52:25,430 --> 01:52:27,348
Don't open any of mine. I mean it.

1008
01:52:27,432 --> 01:52:30,726
- Who's Mr. Duncan?
- Duncan? I don't know.

1009
01:52:30,810 --> 01:52:34,480
All right, everyone, just calm down.
Calm down! Hey! Hey!

1010
01:52:35,273 --> 01:52:40,527
All right. Now, if Kevin hadn't screwed up
in the first place, again,

1011
01:52:41,738 --> 01:52:45,574
then we wouldn't be in this
most perfect and huge hotel room

1012
01:52:45,659 --> 01:52:48,077
with a truckload of all this free stuff.

1013
01:52:48,161 --> 01:52:52,623
So, I think it only fair that Kevin
get to open up the first present.

1014
01:52:54,084 --> 01:52:57,252
Then I'll go and the rest of you and so on.

1015
01:53:01,383 --> 01:53:05,094
- Merry Christmas, Kev.
- Merry Christmas, Buzz.

1016
01:53:07,889 --> 01:53:13,560
- Merry Christmas, Kevin.
- Okay, Kevin! All right! Merry Christmas!

1017
01:53:15,271 --> 01:53:20,067
Enough of this gooey... Show of emotion.
Everyone, let's dig in!

1018
01:53:20,151 --> 01:53:22,027
All right!

1019
01:53:22,112 --> 01:53:25,364
Everybody, now, wait, save the paper.
We can use it next year. And the bows.

1020
01:53:25,448 --> 01:53:27,282
Give me the bows...

1021
01:54:02,819 --> 01:54:04,528
Merry Christmas.

1022
01:54:06,740 --> 01:54:09,324
Kevin! Merry Christmas!

1023
01:54:10,660 --> 01:54:12,911
I got something for you.

1024
01:54:20,378 --> 01:54:24,757
- What's this?
- It's a turtledove. I have one. You have one.

1025
01:54:24,841 --> 01:54:28,886
As long as we each have a turtledove,
we'll be friends forever.

1026
01:54:32,849 --> 01:54:34,892
Oh, Kevin.

1027
01:54:38,062 --> 01:54:39,813
Thank you.

1028
01:54:41,149 --> 01:54:43,525
I won't forget you. Trust me.

1029
01:55:11,721 --> 01:55:14,723
Mr. McCallister's room service bill, sir.

1030
01:55:16,059 --> 01:55:18,060
Merry Christmas, sir.

1031
01:55:24,150 --> 01:55:26,193
Nice family. Really.

1032
01:55:36,204 --> 01:55:38,247
Merry Christmas indeed.

1033
01:55:39,207 --> 01:55:40,874
Oh, Dad!

1034
01:55:41,459 --> 01:55:46,004
Kevin! You spent $967 on room service?
