11
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:19,287

3
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:22,168
- Ian, please!
Could you just calm down?

4
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,499
- He did not know
I took the car.

5
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:25,164
He will be
absolutely fucking furious.

6
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,627
- Your dad
doesn't have to find out.

7
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,087
We can come back
and get it tomorrow

8
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,502

9
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,966

10
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,656
Don't even think
for half a second

11
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,443
you're going to break open
that car, mate.

12
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,704
So get out of my face.

13
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:09,132
What are you fucking looking at?

14
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:12,090
Stop looking at
my girlfriend, midget!

15
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,720
- Ian, please!

16
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:14,926
- You want to fucky-fucky her?

17
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,590
No way in hell,
'cause let me tell you,

18
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,054
there's only one guy
who fucks her,

19
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,388

20
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,553
so go home and fuck mom now
you demented dwarf!

21
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:50,086

00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,086
Please, no!

23

26

Ian!

27
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:37,081
- Hey, I hope you're not
time wasting, you.

28
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,792
I've got a dozen people
waiting to look at this place,

29
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,752
most of them paying cash
as well.

30
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,963
You got cash?

31
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:48,301
Right, the light switch is
somewhere here I think.

32
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,912
- Hey, come on, let's get
this fucking lease signed, hey?

33

I've called Dr. Sebring,

Get up!

49
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,611
Hello, Martin.

50
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:16,248
Mmm.

51
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:29,386
Martin...

52
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:30,971
come and join us.

53
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:04,588
Well..

54
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,345
Martin, I have your Ventolin.

55
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,103
Martin, I'm here today

56
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:23,145
because your mother is
very worried about you.

57
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:25,609
- He keeps on talking
about a centipede

58
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,648
with 12 people.

59
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:31,285
What does that mean?

60
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,243
- Now, let's see.

61
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:44,666
A centipede can be considered
a phallic symbol.

62
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,255
Centipedes are
very aggressive creatures.

63
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:50,137
Their bite can be very painful.

64
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:55,427
Maybe he is connecting the pain
that a centipede inflicts

65
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:57,186
with the pain inflicted on him

66
00:18:57,345 --> 00:19:02,067
through years of psychological
and sexual abuse by his father.

67
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,897
- I miss my husband.

68
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:17,703
And it's your fault
that he's in prison!

69
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:22,041
- Sometimes people
that are mentally challenged

70
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:29,587
and have a history
of sexual abuse...

71
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:33,427
mutilate
their own sexual organs.

72
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:47,069
I'm sorry.
I going to have to go.

73
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:49,481
There's nothing to worry about.

74
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,991
I'm sure it's just
a passing phase.

75
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,947
Hmm?

76
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:00,575
Martin.

77
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:04,837
Ah.
You're a good boy.

78
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,963
Mrs. Lomax.

79
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,906
- I've decided to kill us both.

80
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:42,496
This music is driving me crazy!

81
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:48,335
I can't stand this any more!

82
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:23,457
He can't stand it any more!

83
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,874
Come on, tell him.

84
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:32,759
Be a man like your father.

85
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:35,761
- Stop fucking bothering me,
you retard.

86
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,595
I play my fucking music
as loud as I fucking want, okay?

87
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:42,135
- Kill us both.
I'm begging you.

88
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,305
- Shut your fucking mouth,
you old cunt.

89
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:48,941
What the fuck?

90
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,109
- I will play my music
so fucking loud,

91
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,818
it's going to make
your fucking ears bleed,

92
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,028
you cock-sucking dwarf.

93

Next time,
you batter that fucking ceiling,

94
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:03,205
I'm gonna come down
and break your fucking neck,

95
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:04,456
Fuck!

96
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:06,458
Fucking little cocksucker.

97
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:08,961
Don't fucking bang
that fucking ceiling

98
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,372
any-fucking-more, okay?

99
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:14,509

165
00:40:58,081 --> 00:40:59,583
Fuck!

166
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:01,717
Oh, fuck!

167
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:16,329
<i>- Swallow it, bitch.</i>

168
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:20,087
<i>Swallow up.</i>

169
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:24,755
- <i>Feed her.</i>

170
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:27,340
<i>Feed her!</i>

171
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:28,595
<i>Ahhh!</i>

172
00:42:55,156 --> 00:43:00,037
- That was fucking sensational.

173
00:43:00,203 --> 00:43:02,080
And you know what?

174
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:06,467
Your pussy smells gorgeous.

175
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:07,923
Yeah.

176
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:09,133
How you doing, doc?

177
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,764
Oh, I rather fuck
that retarded boy,

178
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:18,305
but... this'll do.

179
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:19,563
- I know a place in Thailand

180
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:22,646
where they specialize
in that sort of thing.

181
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:24,561
Oh, yeah.

182
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:27,071
Oh, yeah, she's a good one.

183
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:29,483
- How much to fuck you
up the arse, darling?

184
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:34,371
- For you, darling, 50.

185
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:45,922
- Jesus.

186
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:47,800
Who the fuck are you?

187
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:51,634
What the fuck have you done
to yourself?

188
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:57,431
That's right.
Have a good stare.

189
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:01,063
Have a good fucking stare,
you little fucking pervert!

190
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:02,849
Fuck off now

191
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:05,894
before I get out of this car
and smash your fucking face in!

192
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:06,936
Don't!

193
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:21,367
- No, please.
Please!

194
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:41,771
- Martin?

195
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:51,777
Martin, it's me,
Dr. Sebring.

196
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:57,028
So...

197
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:58,412
this is where you work.

198
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:04,414
This isn't right, Martin.

199
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:06,705
What you're doing,

200
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:11,126
it's wrong.

201
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:14,671
Martin, I can help you,

202
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:20,014
but you have to put
the gun down.

203
00:45:20,176 --> 00:45:22,679
Imagine what your father
would say if..

204
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:32,939
Martin, Martin, no, Martin!

205
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,974
Please.

206
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:46,979
I'll do anything you want.

207
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:49,311
Please!

208
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:52,818
I won't tell...
I won't tell no one nothing.

209
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:54,024
You fucking...

210
00:46:58,149 --> 00:47:01,449
Someone help me!

211
00:47:52,328 --> 00:47:54,922
<i>- Hi, Martin, this is Arianne,
Miss Yennie's manager.</i>

212
00:47:55,081 --> 00:47:57,083
<i>I wanted to confirm
that Miss Yennie is not delayed</i>

213
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:58,717
<i>and will be landing
this morning</i>

214
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:01,550
<i>on London's Heathrow Airport
at 6:00 a.m. your time.</i>

215
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,714
<i>I understand your driver
will be picking her up.</i>

216
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,178
<i>I hope she does
a great audition.</i>

217
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:07,844
<i>Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Bye-bye!</i>

218
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:37,001
- God, I cannot believe
I am here

219
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:40,509
auditioning for
a Quentin Tarantino film.

220
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:43,512
My agents are so excited
about this.

221
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:48,429
I should probably call them,

222
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:52,096
tell them I landed
and, you know, I'm on my way.

223
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,897
- Have you seen
<i>The Human Centipede?</i>

224
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,782
- I was really drawn
to the film

225
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,442
because of
the medical aspect of it.

226
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:05,905
If you were a surgeon,

227
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:08,446
you could actually perform
that surgery.

228
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:11,035
It's just so scary.

229
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:16,128
It was so grueling
being on all fours,

230
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:18,836
so I demanded in my contract
that I had to have

231
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:20,625
an hour... long massage
every night.

232
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,510
I mean, why would I not
demand that in my contract?

233
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,467
Oh, and the rest of the cast,

234
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:28,007
we all took showers before we
shot the centipede stuff,

235
00:49:28,174 --> 00:49:30,768
because I mean, you're close
to someone's butt,

236
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:33,054
and you don't want to smell
anything and...

237
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,847
or, you know, whatever.

238
00:49:35,014 --> 00:49:36,391
I'm kind of a germaphobe.

239
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:38,480
Um...

240
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:56,123
Oh, that must be Quentin's car.

241
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,216
Do you have an umbrella?

242
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:10,974
Because this rain
will ruin my hair.

243
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:14,850
Okay.

244
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,982
Oh!

245
01:07:58,283 --> 01:08:02,288
- Please, please.

246
01:08:02,453 --> 01:08:05,923
Please don't hurt me.

247
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:07,925
Please.

248
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:10,303
I'll do everything.

249
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:38,975
<i>- Hello, this Marc from
USA Actors Management again.</i>

256

257
01:09:49,894 --> 01:09:51,362

<i>so please call me back

259
01:09:53,147 --> 01:09:54,319
<i>at this number to confirm.</i>

260
01:09:54,482 --> 01:09:55,574
<i>Thanks very, very much.</i>

261
01:09:55,733 --> 01:09:57,360
<i>Talk to you soon.
Good-bye.</i>

262
01:20:16,103 --> 01:20:17,229
- Ah!

262
01:20:18,305 --> 01:21:18,243
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
