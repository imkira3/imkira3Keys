00:02:45,595 --> 00:02:48,223
Watch out!

3
00:02:50,733 --> 00:02:51,495
Sorry.

4
00:03:14,523 --> 00:03:16,582
Yo, what's up with that?

5
00:03:16,692 --> 00:03:20,150
Tommy quit.
Looks like he went out in style.

6
00:03:20,263 --> 00:03:23,596
You know Tommy.
You better steer clear of Bostick today.

7
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:27,396
Come on, man. I invented the low profile.
I ain't goin' near that.

8
00:03:27,503 --> 00:03:31,166
Hey! Bostick wants to see everybody. Now!

9
00:03:31,274 --> 00:03:35,210
Check it out. Openin' up two miles from here.

10
00:03:35,311 --> 00:03:38,610
Hello, Castle World.
I heard that.

11
00:03:38,714 --> 00:03:43,413
We've survived a recession,
two earthquakes and a health inspector...

12
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,353
Who, despite my many advances,
turned out to be gay.

13
00:03:47,423 --> 00:03:52,122
We're not goin' anywhere. We're gonna stay
right here and compete with Castle World.

14
00:03:52,194 --> 00:03:57,359
I've been providing quality jobs
for this community for over 27 years.

15
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,893
I got an idea.

16
00:04:01,037 --> 00:04:04,336
Why don't you cash out?
Yeah, yeah. Go to Miami,

17
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,570
Get you a Cadillac and
one of them bald-Headed pool boys.

18
00:04:12,348 --> 00:04:15,044
Everybody get to work.

19
00:04:15,117 --> 00:04:17,347
Jamal, you can clean the moat.

20
00:04:18,087 --> 00:04:19,952
Oh, come on...

21
00:04:20,056 --> 00:04:22,149
But first I wanna talk to you.

22
00:04:22,258 --> 00:04:25,716
Damn it, Jamal. Can't you look
outside yourself for two seconds...

23
00:04:25,795 --> 00:04:30,129
And just buckle down and help me?
Why can't you help yourself?

24
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:35,061
Forget about the community and
"providing' quality jobs" for people.

25
00:04:35,338 --> 00:04:38,068
Take what money you got, and jet.

26
00:04:38,941 --> 00:04:41,341
Book it. You feel me?

27
00:04:41,877 --> 00:04:44,903
Get out. Bye-Bye.

28
00:04:45,348 --> 00:04:47,612
You don't get it, do you?

29
00:04:49,185 --> 00:04:51,312
I had high hopes for you.

30
00:04:52,221 --> 00:04:54,917
Maybe you shouldn't have.

31
00:04:56,225 --> 00:04:58,216
Jamal.

32
00:04:58,327 --> 00:05:01,819
Clean up them battin' helmets
while you're at it.

33
00:05:10,272 --> 00:05:12,672
Urgh! Dang, man!

34
00:05:15,244 --> 00:05:19,442
Man, this is like some
Three Mile lsland, Exxon Valdez shit.

35
00:05:19,515 --> 00:05:21,847
What other choice do we have, man?

36
00:05:21,917 --> 00:05:25,318
In two weeks Castle World's gonna
blow this place out the water.

37
00:05:25,388 --> 00:05:27,948
We apply now,

38
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:30,784
Avoid the rush.

39
00:05:30,893 --> 00:05:33,487
Oh!
You feel me?

40
00:05:33,562 --> 00:05:36,156
Yes!
Cos I can't keep doin' this, not here.

41
00:05:36,265 --> 00:05:39,359
Oh. All right. OK.

42
00:05:39,668 --> 00:05:42,899
To Castle World!
To Castle World!

43
00:05:47,143 --> 00:05:49,771
And then I go in...
Aah!

44
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:51,938
You dead.

45
00:05:55,351 --> 00:05:57,478
Hey!

46
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:05,126
That's gotta be worth a lot of money.
What?

47
00:06:06,362 --> 00:06:09,627
Oh, hold on.
Let me get something to get that out.

48
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,101
Agh!

49
00:06:55,478 --> 00:06:58,072
What the hell...? Hey, Steve!

50
00:06:58,914 --> 00:07:01,280
Mrs. Bostick!

51
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,818
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

52
00:07:04,687 --> 00:07:06,814
The water's cold!

53
00:07:24,907 --> 00:07:27,171
You disturb my peace.

54
00:07:27,309 --> 00:07:29,834
What is your business here?

55
00:07:29,912 --> 00:07:31,971
What the hell?

56
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,449
Oh, all right. I get it.

57
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:51,530
You had too much to drink, huh?
Opening' party for Castle World?

58
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,559
Oh, you're upset.
I ain't got no beef with you, dog.

59
00:07:55,905 --> 00:07:59,568
Kindly address me with the proper respect.

60
00:07:59,675 --> 00:08:01,836
I am Knolte of Marlboro.

61
00:08:04,947 --> 00:08:08,280
And I am not a dog.

62
00:08:15,524 --> 00:08:19,654
You may not be a dog,
but you may wanna roll over.

63
00:08:20,262 --> 00:08:23,254
Got my suit all soaked up.

64
00:08:24,466 --> 00:08:27,902
Wait a minute. You ain't breathin', man!

65
00:08:31,674 --> 00:08:33,335
Ohh!

66
00:08:33,442 --> 00:08:36,434
He ain't breathin'! Um... 911!

67
00:08:36,745 --> 00:08:39,737
911! White man down!

68
00:08:39,848 --> 00:08:41,679
White man down!

69
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,945
I'm gonna get a little close to your mouth...

70
00:08:44,053 --> 00:08:48,149
So if you wake up and you see
a brother on you, I ain't like that.

71
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,656
It's about gettin' you to breathe.

72
00:08:50,726 --> 00:08:53,718
So bear with me. Ahh!

73
00:08:55,364 --> 00:08:57,958
Here we go. Here.

74
00:08:59,001 --> 00:09:01,094
Oh, damn!

75
00:09:01,804 --> 00:09:04,671
What you been eatin', spoiled nachos?

76
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,435
Wait. Wait, wait!

77
00:09:06,508 --> 00:09:08,738
Uh, where...

78
00:09:08,844 --> 00:09:11,108
Uh... Spray paint.

79
00:09:11,213 --> 00:09:13,647
I ain't gonna spray-Paint you. No!

80
00:09:13,716 --> 00:09:17,015
Ah, hold on.

81
00:09:17,086 --> 00:09:19,145
Here we go.

82
00:09:20,656 --> 00:09:22,715
Bahh!
Agh!

83
00:09:29,932 --> 00:09:31,900
You've saved my life.

84
00:09:32,534 --> 00:09:36,937
Don't mention it.
I owe you... thanks.

85
00:09:37,072 --> 00:09:39,700
Don't even worry about it.
Where do you live, man?

86
00:09:39,775 --> 00:09:41,970
Come on. Here you go. Come on.

87
00:09:43,112 --> 00:09:45,740
This is it?
It is.

88
00:09:45,881 --> 00:09:47,872
What the...?

89
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:52,478
Whoa, whoa. You got a license
to have animals, man?

90
00:09:52,554 --> 00:09:55,887
This is a big-Ass donkey.
Do you have a license for this?

91
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,722
Homie, may I make a suggestion?

92
00:09:58,794 --> 00:10:04,323
IKEA. Yeah, get you some end tables
and some of them $5 lamps, man.

93
00:10:04,466 --> 00:10:08,402
You know, and a futon. Then you'll be stylin'.

94
00:10:08,504 --> 00:10:12,907
And try to wear somethin' on your feet
that has a little give other than metal.

95
00:10:13,108 --> 00:10:15,702
You know, get you the proper sneaker.

96
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:19,172
Are you hungry?

97
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:22,384
What is that, man?

98
00:10:22,484 --> 00:10:25,942
'Tis food.
'Tis road kill, man!

99
00:10:26,021 --> 00:10:28,990
Ugh. You know what?
Get you some food stamps.

100
00:10:29,091 --> 00:10:31,889
Just tell them you doin' bad.
You know what I mean?

101
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:36,363
You know, if they don't believe you, ask
a social worker to come through your spot,

102
00:10:36,432 --> 00:10:39,595
Check out where are you livin', cos this is...

103
00:10:40,636 --> 00:10:42,695
It's like that, seriously.

104
00:10:42,771 --> 00:10:46,798
And you oughta get yourself
into a shelter, you know?

105
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:49,104
Try that. So, um...

106
00:10:49,178 --> 00:10:51,646
Thank you for inviting me to your place.

107
00:10:52,214 --> 00:10:53,977
Thank you

108
00:10:54,049 --> 00:10:56,916
For your... conversation.

109
00:10:57,186 --> 00:11:01,646
You thankin' me for talkin' to you?
I am a man reviled for my failings,

110
00:11:01,724 --> 00:11:08,129
For... for I have not served well my queen.

111
00:11:09,498 --> 00:11:11,989
I must be crazy, man.

112
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,702
Here's two bucks. All right?

113
00:11:21,777 --> 00:11:25,110
Get yourself some soap
and, uh, some Tic Tacs.

114
00:11:26,515 --> 00:11:28,608
I'm gonna get up outta here.

115
00:11:28,717 --> 00:11:30,912
Freeway should be that way?

116
00:11:31,954 --> 00:11:34,013
I'll find it.

117
00:11:49,505 --> 00:11:52,702
Brother lost in the woods: not good.

118
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:20,698
Oh, hell, no! You know you did wrong!

119
00:12:24,673 --> 00:12:28,541
Oh, shit! Castle World?

120
00:12:33,882 --> 00:12:36,350
Mrs Bostick, you're in trouble.

121
00:12:41,457 --> 00:12:45,359
You all seen that?
They tried to run me...

122
00:12:46,061 --> 00:12:48,154
Hold up! Hold up!

123
00:12:49,364 --> 00:12:51,457
Hold up!

124
00:12:52,868 --> 00:12:55,234
Hey, let me see your manager, OK?

125
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:59,170
I damn near got trampled
by some of them dumb-Ass actors

126
00:12:59,274 --> 00:13:01,265
Takin' their job way too seriously!

127
00:13:01,343 --> 00:13:05,177
Who be ye?
Who be l?

128
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,738
I be stompin' your ass,
you put your hand on me one more again!

129
00:13:08,817 --> 00:13:11,513
OK? I'm from South Central.

130
00:13:11,887 --> 00:13:13,946
Florence and Normandie.

131
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,424
Normandy? A thousand pardons.

132
00:13:17,526 --> 00:13:20,518
We've been awaiting word from Normandy.
Please, enter.

133
00:13:20,596 --> 00:13:23,326
We'll inform the king of your arrival.

134
00:13:25,801 --> 00:13:30,170
That's more like it. That's how brothers
need to be treated, you know?

135
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:34,005
And talk to your boy,
cos punks jump up to get beat down.

136
00:13:35,744 --> 00:13:37,803
I'll holler!

137
00:13:38,514 --> 00:13:41,506
Whoa. Castle World's got it goin' on:

138
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:45,383
Horses, costumes, smells...

139
00:13:48,757 --> 00:13:51,453
Hello. Lose the hat, homie.

140
00:13:51,793 --> 00:13:54,921
Thank you for saving our little village.

141
00:13:54,997 --> 00:13:59,195
And such is the legend of the Black Knight.

142
00:14:10,812 --> 00:14:13,679
The princess will look so beautiful!

143
00:14:13,749 --> 00:14:16,343
It will be a wedding for the ages.
Don't you agree?

144
00:14:16,418 --> 00:14:18,579
Yes, but she doesn't love him.

145
00:14:18,687 --> 00:14:20,678
So? She's but a woman.

146
00:14:20,756 --> 00:14:23,725
What if a woman were not
considered just a man's property...

147
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:26,556
And were free to choose her own husband?

148
00:14:26,628 --> 00:14:29,756
Are you feeling ill?
Let us pray it's not plague.

149
00:14:29,831 --> 00:14:32,322
Should she be bled?
No.

150
00:14:32,401 --> 00:14:35,734
No, I'm quite well. It was just foolish talk.

151
00:14:38,907 --> 00:14:40,372
Oh, damn.

152
00:14:44,877 --> 00:14:47,141
That's what I'm talkin' about.

153
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:51,574
Uh...

154
00:14:55,554 --> 00:14:57,954
Allow me to introduce myself.

155
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:00,321
Jamal.

156
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:03,620
Victoria.

157
00:15:07,066 --> 00:15:11,765
Oh, wait! Uh, look, darlin'.
Don't cheat yourself, treat yourself.

158
00:15:11,904 --> 00:15:13,963
Uh, look, uh...

159
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,775
I, uh, I don't... work here.

160
00:15:17,877 --> 00:15:19,868
Yeah, I'm a talent agent.

161
00:15:19,945 --> 00:15:25,850
I represent, uh, people like...
Mariah... Denzel...

162
00:15:26,452 --> 00:15:29,944
You can call him Zel.
I'll let him know just you gonna call him Zel.

163
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:34,048
But I gotta tell you... I'm just gonna be
upfront and say it. You are gorgeous.

164
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,590
You glow, girl.

165
00:15:36,695 --> 00:15:38,993
You speak with an unusual tongue.

166
00:15:39,098 --> 00:15:41,896
Oh, no, that's just how
we talk in my neighborhood.

167
00:15:41,967 --> 00:15:45,494
Now, look, first thing we gotta do
is get some pictures taken.

168
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:48,131
You own a thong?
A what?

169
00:15:48,374 --> 00:15:53,175
OK, never mind. Why don't you just bring
an old pair of drawers and cut the ass out?

170
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,713
You know? So just give me your number.

171
00:15:55,781 --> 00:15:57,578
Seven.

172
00:15:57,683 --> 00:15:59,878
Excuse me?
You asked my number.

173
00:15:59,952 --> 00:16:03,683
I am one of the king's
chambermaids, number seven.

174
00:16:03,756 --> 00:16:06,452
Oh. Well, that must be
your employee number.

175
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:11,758
No, I was talkin' about your phone number.
Don't worry. I'll write my number down.

176
00:16:11,864 --> 00:16:14,128
Anybody got a pen?

177
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:21,464
You can read and write?
Yeah.

178
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,668
Who you been datin'? You gotta raise the bar.

179
00:16:25,978 --> 00:16:30,779
Good day, ladies. How are you
feeling today? Wait. I shall tell thee.

180
00:16:32,084 --> 00:16:34,177
Yes.

181
00:16:34,286 --> 00:16:36,345
Very nice.

182
00:16:41,794 --> 00:16:44,092
You especially, my Nubian queen.

183
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:53,900
Hey, what the hell is wrong with you, man?
Don't you know that's sexual harassment?

184
00:16:53,973 --> 00:16:58,137
Ah! You the idiot that damn near
ran me over, aren't you?

185
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:01,737
Wait till I find your boss.
He's gonna fire your metallic ass.

186
00:17:01,847 --> 00:17:04,941
You would do well
to mind your tongue, Moor.

187
00:17:05,551 --> 00:17:09,317
Or I will cut it out and feed it to the dogs.

188
00:17:16,228 --> 00:17:18,958
Come here.
Nah, I'm just messin' with you, man.

189
00:17:19,064 --> 00:17:21,931
I ain't no talent agent, so cut the act.

190
00:17:22,034 --> 00:17:26,437
I'm just tryin' to get at her.
Ain't she fine? Watch me work.

191
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:29,736
Moor! Do you mock me?

192
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:32,902
The king awaits thee, messenger.

193
00:17:32,978 --> 00:17:35,538
You might want to take a chill pill, all right?

194
00:17:35,648 --> 00:17:37,843
"Do you mock me, Moor?"

195
00:17:37,917 --> 00:17:40,681
Hey, look, your boss
makes you call him "king"?

196
00:17:40,753 --> 00:17:43,051
We gotta talk union.

197
00:17:43,122 --> 00:17:47,525
Yeah, man, that's not right.
We gotta get you a dental plan.

198
00:17:49,094 --> 00:17:53,463
We do apologize, sire. We did not
expect your arrival for several weeks.

199
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:55,898
How shall I introduce thee?
What do you mean?

200
00:17:55,968 --> 00:17:59,131
Your formal introduction
for your audience with the king.

201
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:00,398
Formal introduction?

202
00:18:05,744 --> 00:18:08,736
Your Majesty, if I may have your attention?

203
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:13,044
Starting at small forward,

204
00:18:13,118 --> 00:18:15,678
From lnglewood High,

205
00:18:15,754 --> 00:18:21,090
Two-Time All-County Conference Player
of the Year, the messenger from Normandy,

206
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:25,494
Jamal "Sky" Walker!

207
00:18:26,632 --> 00:18:30,659
That be l! What's up? What's happenin', y'all?

208
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:34,035
Thank you! Appreciate it,
big homie! Thank you!

209
00:18:34,106 --> 00:18:36,233
It's the...

210
00:18:36,308 --> 00:18:38,299
Hey, what's up, now?

211
00:18:38,644 --> 00:18:42,102
Oh, man! Now, that brings back memories.

212
00:18:44,116 --> 00:18:49,281
You arrive early. My daughter and I
welcome you. What news from Normandy?

213
00:18:49,355 --> 00:18:51,949
Uh... what news?

214
00:18:52,057 --> 00:18:54,150
Well, a couple of drive-Bys.

215
00:18:55,127 --> 00:18:58,062
Other than that, same ol', same ol'.

216
00:18:59,465 --> 00:19:02,127
When will the duke arrive
to take my daughter's hand?

217
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:07,034
This is a hell of a setup you got here.
I mean, I'm not lyin'. I mean, whoo!

218
00:19:07,139 --> 00:19:11,007
You got to have major coins behind this.
Who's backin' you - Puffy?

219
00:19:11,076 --> 00:19:15,877
Silence, Moor! Tell me,
when will the duke arrive?

220
00:19:16,715 --> 00:19:20,344
Oh, I get it. You wanna see if I can improve.

221
00:19:20,686 --> 00:19:22,210
OK, well, let's see...

222
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:24,619
The duke will arriveth...

223
00:19:24,723 --> 00:19:30,286
In all his royal pomposity
and splendor on Tuesday.

224
00:19:30,562 --> 00:19:33,827
Tuesday! Ha. That is excellent news.

225
00:19:34,099 --> 00:19:39,059
Ah. Phillip, have the servants ply this
messenger with much food and drink.

226
00:19:39,138 --> 00:19:42,733
And let him lay with any damsel he desires.

227
00:19:42,841 --> 00:19:45,639
Except my daughter, of course.

228
00:20:04,463 --> 00:20:07,489
Can I get a ride back to town?
Oh, an excellent idea.

229
00:20:07,566 --> 00:20:10,057
Phillip, show our guest the grounds.

230
00:20:10,135 --> 00:20:14,902
Allow him rest, and then
we shall ride, and ride we shall.

231
00:20:15,407 --> 00:20:18,171
Oh, ho, ho! This is funky!

232
00:20:18,277 --> 00:20:20,302
Hey, oh!

233
00:20:20,412 --> 00:20:24,576
Y'all got the little cutout
thing like the castles for real.

234
00:20:25,717 --> 00:20:27,981
Hey, how you doin', Miss Darlin'?

235
00:20:28,487 --> 00:20:32,150
Hey, look here.
I'm in the presidential suite. Uh-Huh.

236
00:20:33,392 --> 00:20:35,485
Yeah! Oh, so, I get it.

237
00:20:35,561 --> 00:20:38,394
This is like a theme park and a hotel, right?

238
00:20:38,497 --> 00:20:41,193
Sire?
Y'all got the real brick.

239
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,427
None of that fake stuff, huh?

240
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:46,902
Oh, man! Oh, man!
Hey, I need to use your bathroom.

241
00:20:46,972 --> 00:20:49,907
Bathroom? What is that, I pray thee?

242
00:20:49,975 --> 00:20:53,342
I gotta drain the...
you know, drain the anaconda.

243
00:20:53,412 --> 00:20:56,575
Ah, the privy.
Yeah. Appreciate it.

244
00:20:57,182 --> 00:21:00,640
Oh, got to go! Got to... Whoo!

245
00:21:03,088 --> 00:21:04,487
Oh!

246
00:21:10,963 --> 00:21:13,090
Oh, damn!

247
00:21:13,866 --> 00:21:17,358
Seriously, you think you're gonna
charge people money to stay here

248
00:21:17,469 --> 00:21:20,267
And wipe their ass with straw?

249
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:22,534
Ain't gonna happen.

250
00:21:23,175 --> 00:21:26,076
There's doo-Doo on top of the...

251
00:21:26,612 --> 00:21:29,012
Tell me you don't see that shit!

252
00:21:29,114 --> 00:21:31,412
And I mean that literally!

253
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:34,780
Where's the Texaco?
Texaco?

254
00:21:37,523 --> 00:21:41,425
What's happenin'? Where y'all goin'?
To the beheading.

255
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:47,831
They're executing the leader of the rebellion.
Y'all went all-Out. Y'all got the...

256
00:21:48,967 --> 00:21:52,801
You said, say what?
They're executing the leader of the rebellion.

257
00:21:52,905 --> 00:21:55,339
Oh, that should be live. Let's check it out.

258
00:21:55,407 --> 00:21:58,001
Remember that little honey I was hollerin' at?

259
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,578
Out the window?
Yeah, yes, yeah!

260
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:07,043
Hey, that's tight!

261
00:22:14,993 --> 00:22:17,587
Long live our deposed queen!

262
00:22:18,664 --> 00:22:21,155
Power to the people!

263
00:22:26,705 --> 00:22:29,401
Sorry, I didn't mean
to interrupt your rehearsal.

264
00:22:29,508 --> 00:22:32,568
Please, proceed, proceed.

265
00:22:40,118 --> 00:22:44,885
Y'all got a head that comes off?
A neck that spurts blood?

266
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:47,551
Look at the head.

267
00:22:47,626 --> 00:22:50,356
How do they make it look so real?

268
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:54,826
Oh, because it is real.

269
00:23:20,058 --> 00:23:22,288
You have to calm yourself.

270
00:23:22,361 --> 00:23:26,730
Calm myself?
I was just holdin' a human head!

271
00:23:26,865 --> 00:23:30,858
You'd think you've never seen an execution.
Not lately!

272
00:23:30,936 --> 00:23:33,370
Wait, uh...

273
00:23:33,472 --> 00:23:36,566
OK, all right. What day is it?

274
00:23:36,675 --> 00:23:41,510
Is it Sunday the 5th?
Yes, messenger, I believe it is.

275
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,878
2001?
Two?

276
00:23:43,949 --> 00:23:46,543
It is the Year of our Lord, 1328.

277
00:23:48,186 --> 00:23:51,121
Argh!
The date frightens you?

278
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:55,017
You think it don't when it does! Oh!

279
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,923
I didn't mean...

280
00:23:56,995 --> 00:23:59,327
OK, let me calm... Let me just relax.

281
00:23:59,398 --> 00:24:02,367
That's what... a seat. It's a...

282
00:24:02,701 --> 00:24:05,932
All right, is this how you use the chair?

283
00:24:06,038 --> 00:24:09,064
OK, cos I don't really know if you should go...

284
00:24:12,944 --> 00:24:15,913
I gotta go!
But leave you cannot!

285
00:24:15,981 --> 00:24:19,246
There's work to be done.
You wear the medallion.

286
00:24:19,318 --> 00:24:21,878
Well, lots of brothers wear medallions.

287
00:24:21,953 --> 00:24:25,684
I got a cousin. He'll wear a manhole cover
if you get a big enough chain.

288
00:24:25,757 --> 00:24:29,318
You gotta put some bling-Bling on it, though.

289
00:24:31,563 --> 00:24:34,396
You're nervous.
Yeah, a little.

290
00:24:34,499 --> 00:24:37,332
Cos this is not...
I don't even know where I'm from.

291
00:24:37,402 --> 00:24:39,563
When I walked in I saw, like, um...

292
00:24:39,671 --> 00:24:42,105
Let me calm your spirits.

293
00:24:42,808 --> 00:24:47,871
Oh, my damn. Y'all really know
how to make a brother feel welcome.

294
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:50,574
Yeah. Let's make it happen! Huh?

295
00:24:50,682 --> 00:24:53,742
Grab that leg for me right there.
Why do you disrobe?

296
00:24:57,422 --> 00:25:00,152
Um... Well, uh....

297
00:25:01,693 --> 00:25:03,752
I saw you were gettin' out your drawers.

298
00:25:03,862 --> 00:25:07,628
I wanted to show you that
l, too, wear the medallion.

299
00:25:11,937 --> 00:25:15,270
Yeah. You know what? That was my thinkin'.

300
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:18,867
Cos it looks just like mine right here. See?
Of course.

301
00:25:18,944 --> 00:25:23,244
I'm here to help you kill the king and
return the kingdom to our deposed queen.

302
00:25:23,315 --> 00:25:25,749
Say what?
That's why we wear the medallion.

303
00:25:25,884 --> 00:25:31,948
I was wearing my medallion cos I thought
it looked good with my gear. You know?

304
00:25:32,057 --> 00:25:33,991
So, how will you do it?
Huh?

305
00:25:34,092 --> 00:25:37,960
Poisonous snakes in his chamber,
or drop him off the edge of the earth?

306
00:25:38,063 --> 00:25:42,864
God knows he deserves it, after killing King
John and stealing the throne from our queen.

307
00:25:42,934 --> 00:25:46,392
He left a warning to all those
who might dare oppose him.

308
00:25:46,505 --> 00:25:48,803
What kind of warning?

309
00:25:57,015 --> 00:25:59,677
Oh!

310
00:26:01,753 --> 00:26:03,516
I'll be goin' now. Yeah, I'm just gonna step...

311
00:26:04,456 --> 00:26:07,550
We have a horse ready for you, sire.
The king awaits thee.

312
00:26:07,659 --> 00:26:10,059
Horse?
You said you wanted to ride.

313
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:12,287
Yeah.

314
00:26:12,364 --> 00:26:15,925
Oh, shit!

315
00:26:16,168 --> 00:26:18,659
He's yours to ride.
Me?

316
00:26:23,308 --> 00:26:28,473
I haven't been, uh...
totally honest to you about who I am.

317
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,680
Oh?

318
00:26:30,749 --> 00:26:32,046
Uh...

319
00:26:32,117 --> 00:26:36,577
I'm not only the duke's official messenger,

320
00:26:38,156 --> 00:26:40,716
But I'm also the court jester.

321
00:26:42,394 --> 00:26:45,056
Messenger and jester.

322
00:26:46,097 --> 00:26:48,258
An odd combination of talents.

323
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:50,392
Bring him on.

324
00:27:06,451 --> 00:27:08,919
That is funny.

325
00:27:10,522 --> 00:27:11,511
Damn!

326
00:28:27,632 --> 00:28:29,896
King Leo. Bastard.

327
00:28:29,968 --> 00:28:33,028
I've a mind to slice him open
and feed him to the masses.

328
00:28:33,104 --> 00:28:35,868
Soon, brother. Very soon.

329
00:28:46,284 --> 00:28:48,946
Come on, man. Help a brother out.

330
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:02,905
I admire his commitment.

331
00:29:03,009 --> 00:29:07,446
He's no longer funny,
but he refuses to give up on the joke.

332
00:29:09,483 --> 00:29:12,077
Messenger and jester.

333
00:29:12,185 --> 00:29:14,676
I have great respect for this man.

334
00:29:23,597 --> 00:29:26,589
Does that feel better?
Yeah.

335
00:29:28,935 --> 00:29:32,462
Good. The bloodletting
appears to be working.

336
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:38,841
What's that?
It's to burn off the leeches.

337
00:29:38,912 --> 00:29:41,005
The what?

338
00:29:48,855 --> 00:29:51,722
Oh! Ah! Agh!

339
00:29:57,297 --> 00:29:59,857
Now I gotta get home. Where's the lake?

340
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:06,265
Which lake? Where?
The one with the... drunk-Ass homeless guy.

341
00:30:06,339 --> 00:30:08,637
Uh... Knolte.

342
00:30:09,543 --> 00:30:11,511
Knolte?

343
00:30:11,578 --> 00:30:14,445
He's dead.
No, he just smells dead.

344
00:30:14,514 --> 00:30:17,039
Am I interrupting?
Yes.

345
00:30:17,484 --> 00:30:22,080
My apologies. There is a banquet tonight,
and the king requests your presence.

346
00:30:22,155 --> 00:30:24,953
Oh, I don't think I can make that.

347
00:30:26,593 --> 00:30:29,255
My schedule just opened up.

348
00:30:31,097 --> 00:30:32,257
Mmm. Hmm?

349
00:30:53,353 --> 00:30:58,586
Let us celebrate the upcoming union
between my daughter and the Norman duke.

350
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:01,559
He is coming, isn't he?

351
00:31:04,297 --> 00:31:06,561
Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, the duke?

352
00:31:06,666 --> 00:31:08,566
Oh, no doubt. He'll be here.

353
00:31:08,668 --> 00:31:14,334
Yeah, the duke, he just likes to stop off,
you know, see the sights and, uh...

354
00:31:15,175 --> 00:31:20,169
Stuckey's. He likes to stop at Stuckey's
because they got a banana pie that he likes.

355
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,840
But he'll be here.

356
00:31:23,884 --> 00:31:25,943
Allow me to carve.

357
00:31:47,007 --> 00:31:49,498
Peas?
Uh, uh...

358
00:31:51,745 --> 00:31:53,804
Uh, please.

359
00:31:54,881 --> 00:31:57,281
I'd like to learn more about your culture.

360
00:31:57,384 --> 00:32:01,286
It is my understanding that
the Normans are excellent dancers.

361
00:32:01,354 --> 00:32:06,223
If you wanna know more about my culture,
remove the dog from the table.

362
00:32:06,293 --> 00:32:11,822
No offense, King, but the thing about dancing
was a very stereotypical thing you said.

363
00:32:11,932 --> 00:32:14,492
So, you cannot dance?
Ahh!

364
00:32:16,236 --> 00:32:20,366
Can I dance? Come on, man.
That's how I get down.

365
00:32:21,474 --> 00:32:23,965
Please, pleasure us with your skills.

366
00:32:25,145 --> 00:32:27,443
Now?
Mmm. Silence!

367
00:32:27,547 --> 00:32:33,452
Servants, clear the floor, so Sky Walker
may demonstrate some fine Norman dancing.

368
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:39,755
Um...

369
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:49,461
Time to get the boogie on. Oh, yeah.

370
00:32:52,138 --> 00:32:54,197
Dance well, Moor.

371
00:32:56,209 --> 00:33:00,168
I'm startin' to like
this word "Moor" Iess and less.

372
00:33:40,653 --> 00:33:43,053
Your Kingliness, special request?

373
00:33:49,929 --> 00:33:52,090
OK.

374
00:33:52,165 --> 00:33:55,657
Now, this is a pretty white crowd, OK?
So nothin' too crazy.

375
00:33:55,735 --> 00:33:58,727
OK? My life's dependin' on it.

376
00:33:58,972 --> 00:34:01,099
OK, guys, I'm gonna need a bass line.

377
00:34:01,174 --> 00:34:05,304
So I'm gonna need y'all to help me out here,
cos I got a lot ridin' on this, man.

378
00:34:05,412 --> 00:34:08,677
Cos y'all got the trumpets,
so I'm gonna need y'all...

379
00:34:08,748 --> 00:34:11,444
Sky Walker.
Yeah?

380
00:34:11,818 --> 00:34:15,015
I'm getting impatient.
I got it together.

381
00:34:15,088 --> 00:34:19,422
I just want the music to be crisp.
Cos if it's crisp, you're gonna jam.

382
00:34:19,492 --> 00:34:25,055
All right. Kick the beat, man. I need you to
kick it like a white boy ain't never kicked it!

383
00:34:25,131 --> 00:34:27,258
Kick it. Uh, follow me, OK?

384
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:29,426
Just, uh, one...

385
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,729
Two.

386
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,766
Three.

387
00:34:59,766 --> 00:35:03,224
Excuse me. Um... y'all gonna get me killed!

388
00:35:03,303 --> 00:35:05,863
Sky Walker!
Uh, yeah?

389
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,699
OK.

390
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:12,804
We're ready, King. One...

391
00:35:14,347 --> 00:35:16,281
Two.

392
00:35:16,416 --> 00:35:17,508
Three.

393
00:38:13,493 --> 00:38:19,090
I think our jester-Messenger knows not his
place in society. Perhaps he should learn it.

394
00:38:23,403 --> 00:38:26,839
Your tongue was in my mouth,
swimming around like an eel.

395
00:38:26,906 --> 00:38:30,137
Yeah, it's called a French kiss.
From Normandy?

396
00:38:30,243 --> 00:38:33,144
Florence and Normandie.
Show me more of this.

397
00:38:33,246 --> 00:38:36,340
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

398
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:42,288
Excuse me. You have
no business with this woman.

399
00:38:42,422 --> 00:38:43,855
She was comin' on to me.

400
00:38:43,923 --> 00:38:47,916
Are you accusing our fair princess
of having an interest in thee?

401
00:38:48,027 --> 00:38:50,723
No, I'm accusing her
of having an interest in me.

402
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:57,326
Prepare to taste cold steel.

403
00:38:57,437 --> 00:38:59,029
Behold!

404
00:39:01,841 --> 00:39:03,900
Halt, coward!

405
00:39:06,279 --> 00:39:09,009
Dance to the music

406
00:39:10,116 --> 00:39:12,846
Dance to the music

407
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,867
Agh!

408
00:39:31,437 --> 00:39:33,997
Assassins! Seize them!

409
00:39:48,121 --> 00:39:52,353
This is an outrage!
Lord Percival, how could this happen?

410
00:39:52,458 --> 00:39:57,327
I would be dead right now
were it not for the heroics of Sky Walker.

411
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:01,764
That's very nice of you, King,
but we do what we can do.

412
00:40:03,136 --> 00:40:05,832
Hey, look. Please, allow me.

413
00:40:05,905 --> 00:40:08,271
Lighten up on Percy, OK?

414
00:40:08,341 --> 00:40:11,708
Let's show a little mercy for Percy.

415
00:40:11,778 --> 00:40:15,179
Everyone is entitled to one enormous,

416
00:40:15,281 --> 00:40:19,047
Near-Fatal, catastrophic disaster.

417
00:40:19,552 --> 00:40:22,316
Ain't that right, Percy?
Sky Walker,

418
00:40:22,388 --> 00:40:27,485
Allow me to honor you by appointing you
a lord of my court, in charge of security.

419
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,552
What?! My Liege...
The king is talkin'.

420
00:40:30,663 --> 00:40:33,291
Now, that's rude, Percy.

421
00:40:33,366 --> 00:40:38,269
But I guess that's how you were brought up.
Now, you were saying, Your Magnitude?

422
00:40:38,337 --> 00:40:41,670
Yes, as I was saying, is there
some way I could prevail upon you

423
00:40:41,741 --> 00:40:44,904
To stay awhile and
become a lord of my court?

424
00:40:44,977 --> 00:40:47,969
Lord of the court? What comes with that?

425
00:40:49,182 --> 00:40:51,878
Well, I would give you 60 hectares of land...

426
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,621
With 20 men to till it.
Farming?

427
00:40:58,891 --> 00:41:04,124
No, I gotta think about that awhile.
I would also give you women for your bed.

428
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:08,223
As many as you need.
I've reached my decision.

429
00:41:08,501 --> 00:41:11,436
His Lordship, Sir Sky Walker!

430
00:41:13,773 --> 00:41:16,298
What's up, homie? You straight? Cool.

431
00:41:16,375 --> 00:41:19,037
Um... I decided to stay.

432
00:41:19,111 --> 00:41:22,342
Now, I got an idea how
to make some serious coin.

433
00:41:22,882 --> 00:41:26,943
Have you ever had a Frappuccino?
No? Check this out.

434
00:41:32,959 --> 00:41:35,951
What is it?
Jamal-In-The-Box, man.

435
00:41:36,062 --> 00:41:41,159
Yeah, the first of many. And the good
thing is, it's gonna have a ride-Through.

436
00:41:41,267 --> 00:41:43,997
Yeah, you just gallop up, place your order,

437
00:41:44,103 --> 00:41:46,594
And in seconds, you're outta there,

438
00:41:46,939 --> 00:41:50,272
Killin' and plundering.
Excellent work.

439
00:41:50,343 --> 00:41:53,141
Now, I had my royal tailor whip this up.

440
00:42:04,457 --> 00:42:05,481
Yeah!

441
00:42:06,826 --> 00:42:09,420
Hey, hey, pay attention. See this?

442
00:42:12,565 --> 00:42:17,161
This is my official Sky Walker logo. Yeah.

443
00:42:17,904 --> 00:42:19,963
Whoo! Yes!

444
00:42:21,474 --> 00:42:23,533
Damn, y'all catch on quick.

445
00:42:24,877 --> 00:42:26,970
What do we have here?

446
00:42:29,916 --> 00:42:32,851
Look like you can use some help.

447
00:42:32,919 --> 00:42:37,515
If you think I need help,
you do not understand the game, Moor.

448
00:42:37,657 --> 00:42:40,751
Moor? Well, I prefer "Lordship."

449
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,560
Do you mind?

450
00:42:45,531 --> 00:42:47,590
All right. Excuse me.

451
00:42:48,568 --> 00:42:50,559
All right.

452
00:42:51,003 --> 00:42:52,664
Oh.

453
00:42:52,738 --> 00:42:55,730
To win this game,
you're gonna need your knights.

454
00:42:55,808 --> 00:42:59,471
And you might wanna
leave your rim pawns at home.

455
00:42:59,545 --> 00:43:03,003
Yeah. That's your ass.

456
00:43:03,215 --> 00:43:06,742
Sometimes the queen has to be sacrificed
for the good of the kingdom.

457
00:43:06,886 --> 00:43:09,946
Yeah, but every pawn is a potential queen.

458
00:43:10,056 --> 00:43:13,048
You turn your back,
she'll bite you in your ass.

459
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:16,453
I don't intend to let the game last that long.

460
00:43:18,464 --> 00:43:20,557
Checkmate.

461
00:43:25,338 --> 00:43:27,932
We should get together
and play again sometime.

462
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,338
I'm sure we will.

463
00:43:34,981 --> 00:43:37,074
Mind your back, Moor.

464
00:43:38,351 --> 00:43:41,514
Lord Sky Walker,
the king demands your presence!

465
00:43:41,787 --> 00:43:43,880
Excuse me there, cuz.

466
00:43:43,956 --> 00:43:47,790
Hey, Your Kingliness.
What's up, big homie? What's happenin'?

467
00:43:47,927 --> 00:43:50,932
Were you not to consult
on issues of security?

468
00:43:51,566 --> 00:43:54,262
Uh... yeah.

469
00:43:54,336 --> 00:43:57,430
Why, what happened?
I was out for a ride with my men.

470
00:43:57,506 --> 00:44:03,069
One of my soldiers caught this peasant
stealing a turnip from the castle garden.

471
00:44:05,714 --> 00:44:08,581
Sire, I beg your forgiveness.

472
00:44:09,318 --> 00:44:12,879
I only did it to feed my starvin' family,
for we are...

473
00:44:12,988 --> 00:44:18,255
Silence. Round up his starving family,
take them all away for execution.

474
00:44:19,728 --> 00:44:21,195
You...

475
00:44:21,463 --> 00:44:23,727
Man just said...

476
00:44:27,669 --> 00:44:30,467
How much did you take?
Only a turnip.

477
00:44:33,642 --> 00:44:35,405
Come on!

478
00:44:43,752 --> 00:44:46,050
And Sky Walker?
Yeah?

479
00:44:46,121 --> 00:44:50,080
We are still waiting on your duke.
My patience is wearing thin.

480
00:44:50,759 --> 00:44:53,284
Yes, Y-Your Fabulousness.

481
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:58,222
I'm gonna handle a little somethin'.
Get your ass up!

482
00:44:58,533 --> 00:45:00,967
That's the king. Take a good look at him.

483
00:45:01,103 --> 00:45:03,162
Say "King, I'm sorry"!
King, I'm sorry!

484
00:45:03,238 --> 00:45:05,297
King, I apologize!
King, I apologize!

485
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:08,865
King, that's my ass!
King, that's my ass!

486
00:45:09,678 --> 00:45:13,444
That's your ass. Watch out!
Dead man walkin'! Dead man walkin'!

487
00:45:14,883 --> 00:45:17,044
Dead man walkin'! Dead man walkin'!

488
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:20,247
Why you bring the mean out in me?!

489
00:45:20,322 --> 00:45:24,053
That's the king, and you're gonna
be punished! Punished severely!

490
00:45:24,126 --> 00:45:26,458
With these coins.
Huh?

491
00:45:27,596 --> 00:45:30,064
OK, go. Get outta here. Go.

492
00:45:30,132 --> 00:45:32,464
Here, take the bag too. Go!

493
00:45:33,335 --> 00:45:35,530
You're free. Go!

494
00:45:35,637 --> 00:45:37,696
Get out. Go.

495
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:42,806
With the compliments of the king, it is
his pleasure to share with Lord Sky Walker

496
00:45:42,878 --> 00:45:46,746
His booty.
Booty, as in "spoils of war"?

497
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:50,718
Oh, that booty.

498
00:45:51,686 --> 00:45:53,813
Good night.

499
00:45:58,093 --> 00:45:59,822
Whoo!

500
00:46:00,128 --> 00:46:02,460
Let's get it over with.

501
00:46:02,597 --> 00:46:05,657
You asked to have me delivered to you?
Yeah, so we can talk.

502
00:46:05,767 --> 00:46:07,894
Mm-Hm!
No, seriously.

503
00:46:09,504 --> 00:46:13,270
Um... if you're not naked, they may hear us.

504
00:46:16,445 --> 00:46:19,903
Uh... Iet me break it down for you.

505
00:46:20,282 --> 00:46:24,480
I asked him to bring you here for this
so they wouldn't get suspicious.

506
00:46:24,586 --> 00:46:29,387
Now, we gotta act like we're doin' the do, OK?
Cos the guard's right out front. Uh...

507
00:46:29,891 --> 00:46:32,052
Oh! Oh, yeah!

508
00:46:32,127 --> 00:46:35,062
Oh! Oh, girl! Yeah, there it is.

509
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:39,863
Oh! Ooh! Oh, remind me
to thank the king! Whoo!

510
00:46:42,471 --> 00:46:44,405
Uh...

511
00:46:44,473 --> 00:46:47,704
Sire, you're hung like a horse!

512
00:46:52,714 --> 00:46:55,080
Oh! Oh!

513
00:46:55,317 --> 00:46:56,409
Oh!

514
00:46:56,885 --> 00:47:00,116
Work with me. The king is crazy.

515
00:47:00,255 --> 00:47:03,053
He's killing people over vegetables.

516
00:47:03,158 --> 00:47:06,753
So you'll help with the rebellion?
Oh, no, I got to get outta here.

517
00:47:06,828 --> 00:47:10,389
If the real messenger shows up
they'll slice me up like Wonder Bread.

518
00:47:10,465 --> 00:47:13,366
But you wear the medallion.
You're a man with honor.

519
00:47:13,435 --> 00:47:16,495
And as lord, you now have
even greater access to the king.

520
00:47:16,605 --> 00:47:18,300
Ohh!

521
00:47:19,441 --> 00:47:20,635
Good.

522
00:47:20,709 --> 00:47:23,610
Ohh!

523
00:47:24,412 --> 00:47:26,880
Whoo! Put that up right there.

524
00:47:26,982 --> 00:47:29,780
Now hold that right there. Whoo!

525
00:47:31,086 --> 00:47:34,886
Look, I'm not the guy you're lookin' for.

526
00:47:37,492 --> 00:47:40,325
Then I have nothing more to say to you.

527
00:47:40,428 --> 00:47:42,692
And that is how I break it down.

528
00:47:48,036 --> 00:47:50,869
She's quite a spirited one, eh, sire?

529
00:47:51,006 --> 00:47:54,305
Whoo! Where did y'all get her?

530
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:57,408
Oh! One in a million.

531
00:48:32,814 --> 00:48:36,181
I was hopin' you'd come back
to say good night.

532
00:48:49,831 --> 00:48:51,992
Halt!

533
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:56,999
I am Jobert of Normandy,
with a message from the Duke DuBois.

534
00:49:12,954 --> 00:49:15,354
Sky Walker.
Hm?

535
00:49:15,423 --> 00:49:17,084
Oh!

536
00:49:19,294 --> 00:49:21,353
Regina?
Regina?!

537
00:49:21,463 --> 00:49:25,331
What are you doin' here?
You dare to deflower the king's daughter?

538
00:49:25,433 --> 00:49:28,834
Somebody got to that flower
long before I did.

539
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:30,799
You need to know...

540
00:49:30,872 --> 00:49:34,000
Your daughter's a freak.
Ohh!

541
00:49:35,744 --> 00:49:40,738
The girl has been soiled.
The duke will no longer be interested in...

542
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:47,752
The duke will no longer be interested in
your daughter's hand in marriage. Good day.

543
00:49:47,856 --> 00:49:50,416
You have not only tarnished my daughter,

544
00:49:50,492 --> 00:49:53,052
But any chance of an alliance with Normandy!

545
00:49:53,128 --> 00:49:57,428
He'll pay for this.
Well, what if I was to say,

546
00:49:57,499 --> 00:49:59,660
In all seriousness,

547
00:49:59,734 --> 00:50:02,760
That I'm really, really sorry?

548
00:50:06,675 --> 00:50:08,734
Oh, we misjudged you, Sky Walker.

549
00:50:08,843 --> 00:50:12,779
When you foiled our assassination attempt
and doomed us to execution...

550
00:50:12,881 --> 00:50:15,179
We were a little peeved.
To say the least.

551
00:50:15,283 --> 00:50:17,911
But now, seeing your plan unfold...

552
00:50:18,953 --> 00:50:21,649
Genius.
My plan?

553
00:50:23,091 --> 00:50:26,356
Oh. Well, yeah. Well...

554
00:50:27,262 --> 00:50:28,889
Uh...

555
00:50:28,963 --> 00:50:31,761
Well, I don't like to be obvious, you know?

556
00:50:31,866 --> 00:50:35,461
My plan, it just creeps up on ya.

557
00:50:35,537 --> 00:50:38,370
Yes. Had the king united with Normandy,

558
00:50:38,473 --> 00:50:40,907
Our rebels could never have defeated them.

559
00:50:40,975 --> 00:50:44,877
Because you deflowered the princess,
Leo cannot form his alliance.

560
00:50:44,946 --> 00:50:47,346
Your action has given us hope.

561
00:50:47,415 --> 00:50:50,748
With luck, we can restore
our queen in hiding to the throne.

562
00:50:50,819 --> 00:50:54,346
Sounds like that's a good plan.
It's a perfect plan.

563
00:50:54,422 --> 00:50:57,550
Our deaths will not be in vain.
Well, good, good.

564
00:50:58,026 --> 00:51:01,291
Death?! Ain't nobody dyin' here!

565
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:04,824
Ah, that white girl came on to me!

566
00:51:04,899 --> 00:51:07,732
We're all going to be put to death tomorrow.

567
00:51:07,836 --> 00:51:11,328
You can bloody well bet those
bastards are sharpening the ax.

568
00:51:11,439 --> 00:51:13,669
At least, I hope they're sharpening it.

569
00:51:13,742 --> 00:51:18,179
I saw it done with a blunt ax once.
Took all day.

570
00:51:18,379 --> 00:51:21,542
Just hacking... and hacking

571
00:51:22,183 --> 00:51:24,743
And hacking... and hacking...

572
00:51:24,853 --> 00:51:26,878
We get it, man!

573
00:51:28,123 --> 00:51:30,489
If only the Black Knight were here.
Who?

574
00:51:30,792 --> 00:51:34,455
You never heard of the Black Knight?
You ever heard of Shaq?

575
00:51:36,598 --> 00:51:39,123
We're even.

576
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,600
The legend of the Black Knight...
Legend?

577
00:51:41,703 --> 00:51:44,399
The Black Knight was a great warrior.

578
00:51:44,506 --> 00:51:47,532
Kings tried to buy his might,

579
00:51:47,609 --> 00:51:51,067
But he swore allegiance only to justice.

580
00:51:51,179 --> 00:51:55,343
It is said he was once
swallowed whole by a fierce dragon.

581
00:51:55,416 --> 00:51:59,147
Swallowed whole.
But lo, with a sword of gold,

582
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:01,950
Did he cut his way from the belly of the beast.

583
00:52:02,056 --> 00:52:06,550
And when he emerged, he himself
could breathe the fire of the dragon.

584
00:52:12,901 --> 00:52:16,895
See, this is why you shouldn't
drink your own urine.

585
00:52:20,265 --> 00:52:21,459
Shit!

586
00:52:23,769 --> 00:52:26,101
Let the execution commence!

587
00:52:27,873 --> 00:52:30,103
Maybe we need a-A...

588
00:52:30,208 --> 00:52:33,700
Should wait for a bigger crowd, OK?
I'm only gonna do this once!

589
00:52:33,812 --> 00:52:35,973
Go forth!
OK. Uh...

590
00:52:36,047 --> 00:52:40,245
They want us to line up
in order of color, light to dark!

591
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:44,787
You a priest! I pay my tithe. I go to church.

592
00:52:44,856 --> 00:52:48,019
I give up the moola! Ohh!

593
00:52:48,093 --> 00:52:51,324
Wait! Primitives! They're backwards! Um...

594
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:54,292
Your Kingliness, um, one last word?

595
00:52:57,936 --> 00:52:59,995
Uh...

596
00:53:00,071 --> 00:53:02,062
Well, uh...

597
00:53:03,842 --> 00:53:05,070
Behold!

598
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,472
I am a great sorcerer!

599
00:53:14,786 --> 00:53:17,346
Ooh!

600
00:53:17,422 --> 00:53:19,652
Uh, uh...

601
00:53:19,758 --> 00:53:21,658
Do not anger me!

602
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,786
For with these hands,

603
00:53:24,896 --> 00:53:28,161
I make... fire!

604
00:53:30,502 --> 00:53:33,494
Wait. Uh... fire!

605
00:53:36,174 --> 00:53:38,438
We have fire.

606
00:53:39,311 --> 00:53:40,039
Oh.

607
00:53:40,111 --> 00:53:42,841
Execute him! Now!

608
00:53:44,516 --> 00:53:46,507
No, no!

609
00:53:50,856 --> 00:53:53,051
No!

610
00:54:05,770 --> 00:54:09,729
The sorcerer has cast
a spell of death upon him!

611
00:54:09,841 --> 00:54:11,934
Who?

612
00:54:13,211 --> 00:54:15,441
Yeah! That's right!

613
00:54:15,514 --> 00:54:18,449
I cast a spell of death on him!

614
00:54:18,583 --> 00:54:21,950
But I can bring him back
cos I'm a great sorcerer.

615
00:54:23,922 --> 00:54:26,550
Boogedy-Boogedy-Boogedy!
Agh! Not me!

616
00:54:41,439 --> 00:54:43,669
Behold!

617
00:54:43,775 --> 00:54:46,539
I have somethin' to tell you.

618
00:54:46,611 --> 00:54:51,480
I can make the sun fall from the sky

619
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:55,417
And burn you medieval motherf...

620
00:54:56,454 --> 00:54:58,217
Fire!

621
00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:00,815
The sun is falling! He'll kill us all!

622
00:55:00,892 --> 00:55:03,622
Fear him not! He is no sorcerer!

623
00:55:03,728 --> 00:55:07,095
He is a charlatan and a jester! Seize him!

624
00:55:07,399 --> 00:55:10,129
This way! Down!

625
00:55:16,741 --> 00:55:18,504
Aagh!

626
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:27,409
Get in!

627
00:55:31,356 --> 00:55:32,914
Get him!

628
00:55:37,228 --> 00:55:39,355
Come on!
Go!

629
00:55:39,431 --> 00:55:41,194
Yah!

630
00:55:50,041 --> 00:55:52,566
Close the portcullis!

631
00:56:05,624 --> 00:56:10,548
Open it! Open the portcullis!
It's stuck, sire! It won't open!

632
00:56:18,757 --> 00:56:20,987
Sky Walker!
Knolte!

633
00:56:25,797 --> 00:56:27,731
Up we go.

634
00:56:29,567 --> 00:56:31,660
Fifth time's the charm.

635
00:56:43,281 --> 00:56:47,183
You find them... you kill them.

636
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:04,225
You done this shit before,
haven't you, Knolte?

637
00:57:04,302 --> 00:57:07,738
You saved my life. I simply repaid the debt.

638
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:11,036
Payin' debt? You were
kickin' ass back there, man.

639
00:57:11,109 --> 00:57:15,239
How'd you get in on this?
Your fair Victoria told me of your plight.

640
00:57:15,313 --> 00:57:20,273
Victoria did this for me?
Well, you and the rebellion.

641
00:57:20,352 --> 00:57:24,083
But, uh... a lot of it was for you.

642
00:57:25,490 --> 00:57:27,151
Yeah, that's all right.

643
00:57:45,076 --> 00:57:47,135
Agh!

644
00:57:51,116 --> 00:57:53,277
I wish you well.

645
00:57:53,351 --> 00:57:57,185
Look, I owe you one.
I got your back, all right?

646
00:57:57,288 --> 00:58:01,281
But if you fall into trouble again,
he will not be there. Will you, Sir Knolte?

647
00:58:01,559 --> 00:58:04,687
Sir Knolte?
I paid my debt and now I must leave.

648
00:58:04,763 --> 00:58:07,926
Knolte was once
one of the greatest knights in England,

649
00:58:08,033 --> 00:58:11,264
Until he fell for Percival's trick
and the queen lost her throne.

650
00:58:11,336 --> 00:58:13,827
That was a long time ago.

651
00:58:13,905 --> 00:58:17,170
I've laid down my sword
and I will not fight again.

652
00:58:17,275 --> 00:58:19,334
Wait. Knolte!

653
00:58:20,078 --> 00:58:21,943
Uh, uh...

654
00:58:22,047 --> 00:58:25,073
But... check this out. Knolte!

655
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:27,243
Sir Knolte!

656
00:58:37,962 --> 00:58:43,127
I still say we should move camp. It's just luck
Percival's patrols have yet to discover us.

657
00:58:43,201 --> 00:58:48,264
An interesting suggestion. Now here's
another suggestion: serve more gruel.

658
00:58:49,908 --> 00:58:54,470
You know, y'all dead wrong.
You dead wrong. This is a lady here.

659
00:58:55,013 --> 00:58:58,005
Uh, Vicky? I wanna thank you

660
00:58:58,116 --> 00:59:02,610
For helping Sir Knolte save my life.
Actually, the plan was mine.

661
00:59:02,687 --> 00:59:04,746
No shit?
I shit you not.

662
00:59:05,090 --> 00:59:07,888
I had to tell everyone
I'd heard it from a great warrior,

663
00:59:07,959 --> 00:59:10,928
Otherwise no one would have
listened to me, a woman.

664
00:59:11,029 --> 00:59:17,229
So you like me a little more than you...
Did you have a nice time with the princess?

665
00:59:17,302 --> 00:59:20,465
Wait! Look, the only reason
I slept with the princess,

666
00:59:20,538 --> 00:59:24,736
Cos I thought she was you. That's true.
That's the real true bill. True bill. OK?

667
00:59:24,843 --> 00:59:27,277
It was dark, and I had no night-Light.

668
00:59:27,345 --> 00:59:31,645
I'm tellin' you...
Whatever you think I want to hear.

669
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:35,313
I think all our words have been said.
Hey, Vicky...

670
00:59:35,386 --> 00:59:38,321
I can help you get outta here, way outta here.

671
00:59:38,923 --> 00:59:43,860
Take you to a place where a smart woman
like you can do more than just ladle gruel.

672
00:59:43,928 --> 00:59:48,592
Look, if you show me how to get to the lake,
tomorrow you'll be at Fox Hills Mall

673
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:52,796
Gettin' your legs waxed.
Huh? Drinkin' mai tais, chillin'.

674
00:59:52,904 --> 00:59:58,206
So what's it gonna be?
Gruel, leprosy, mean-Ass king?

675
00:59:59,077 --> 01:00:02,513
Mai tais, chillin', bikini, thong?

676
01:00:03,581 --> 01:00:07,574
I realize that our backward rebel society
is far from perfect,

677
01:00:07,685 --> 01:00:10,176
But it's a step in the right direction.

678
01:00:10,288 --> 01:00:12,483
Now is the eve of our great offensive.

679
01:00:12,557 --> 01:00:17,221
I can live with losing the good fight,
but I cannot live with not fighting it.

680
01:00:22,367 --> 01:00:24,961
The lake you seek is that way.

681
01:00:26,404 --> 01:00:28,269
Safe journey.

682
01:00:46,624 --> 01:00:48,819
Hey, old sot!

683
01:00:50,962 --> 01:00:53,055
I have no quarrel with you, sir.

684
01:00:53,831 --> 01:00:55,958
Finally, the lake.

685
01:00:57,035 --> 01:01:01,199
Better not come out on the other end
fightin' dinosaurs.

686
01:01:14,519 --> 01:01:16,578
All right, think, think, think.

687
01:01:23,061 --> 01:01:27,191
It's not my fight.
Yeah, that's it. It's not my battle.

688
01:01:27,265 --> 01:01:30,826
That's right, it's...
it is not my battle at all. Yeah.

689
01:01:30,935 --> 01:01:34,462
So, uh... Iet's do this.

690
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:37,333
Home sweet home.

691
01:01:42,046 --> 01:01:44,344
Perhaps I'll stand you to a drink.

692
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:47,150
Oh!

693
01:01:47,952 --> 01:01:49,681
Thank you.

694
01:01:50,688 --> 01:01:52,781
Bless you.

695
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:19,911
Man, I think it's time to admit
you have a drinking problem.

696
01:02:21,552 --> 01:02:25,249
I want my grog back. Pick it up.

697
01:02:26,658 --> 01:02:31,027
You don't wanna be messin' with me
cos I'm liable to stuff a mud hole in your ass.

698
01:02:31,129 --> 01:02:33,359
You know?

699
01:02:33,931 --> 01:02:36,195
It's an insult, dumb-Ass.

700
01:02:40,805 --> 01:02:43,330
I have killed six men with these.

701
01:02:46,611 --> 01:02:49,944
What do you move for?
It's called boxing.

702
01:03:03,528 --> 01:03:05,792
That's called a Rope-A-Dope.

703
01:03:20,578 --> 01:03:24,014
Look at the footwork! Look at the footwork!

704
01:03:26,117 --> 01:03:27,550
You know it

705
01:03:27,618 --> 01:03:32,146
Now let me introduce you to my little friend.

706
01:03:42,433 --> 01:03:46,335
Knolte! Come on, man.
I know you got my back.

707
01:03:46,404 --> 01:03:48,804
Knolte is not a fighter.

708
01:03:48,873 --> 01:03:52,036
He is not even a man!
All right, wait.

709
01:04:07,492 --> 01:04:09,551
Aaagh!

710
01:04:19,504 --> 01:04:22,803
Get your ass outta here. That's right.

711
01:04:23,141 --> 01:04:26,941
That's what I'm talkin' about.
Perhaps there's life in the old dog yet.

712
01:04:27,011 --> 01:04:31,380
Oh, man! High five.
This is a high five moment.

713
01:04:31,449 --> 01:04:35,146
Yeah, put your arm up. Right here, like that.

714
01:04:35,219 --> 01:04:37,915
Well, we'll work on that.

715
01:04:38,990 --> 01:04:43,586
Hey, you bad man.
You put his face in the shit!

716
01:04:46,130 --> 01:04:48,223
Yes, I did.

717
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,859
Oh, man.

718
01:04:51,636 --> 01:04:56,039
Hey, Knolte, we was a great team
back there, right? Like Shaq and Kobe.

719
01:04:56,140 --> 01:04:58,199
Shaq and Kobe?

720
01:04:59,010 --> 01:05:03,674
Well, I'll explain it to you when we
get back to the camp. I loved it, man.

721
01:05:03,781 --> 01:05:06,341
This... "Rope-A-Dope."

722
01:05:06,417 --> 01:05:09,909
Could you teach me its mysterious ways?

723
01:05:12,824 --> 01:05:16,089
You just let your man tire himself out, right?

724
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:19,926
He just get the punchin' on you.
Then you like that, while he like this...

725
01:05:19,997 --> 01:05:23,330
Then he tired, and you ready to really...

726
01:05:32,944 --> 01:05:36,107
What happened?
Percival's patrols. They found us.

727
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:39,741
The only men standing are
those of us who were away from camp.

728
01:05:39,817 --> 01:05:43,378
Damn! Victoria told us this would happen.

729
01:05:44,121 --> 01:05:46,646
Victoria!
They took her.

730
01:05:46,791 --> 01:05:49,521
Now she's lost, like our cause.

731
01:05:49,594 --> 01:05:52,586
Just another bauble in the king's crown.

732
01:05:55,166 --> 01:06:00,399
Look here, we just gotta rescue her. You
know what I'm saying? Take out the king.

733
01:06:00,471 --> 01:06:01,938
Uh, uh...

734
01:06:02,006 --> 01:06:04,099
Who here will fight?

735
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:10,570
Who's ready to rumble?

736
01:06:12,717 --> 01:06:14,776
Nobody?!

737
01:06:17,822 --> 01:06:19,551
I will.

738
01:06:24,695 --> 01:06:27,129
That's what I'm talkin' about, Knolte.

739
01:06:27,198 --> 01:06:31,191
But we are greatly depleted,
both in number and in spirit.

740
01:06:31,302 --> 01:06:33,793
Nothing could inspire them
to ever fight again.

741
01:06:33,905 --> 01:06:37,705
These men might
fight for their queen.

742
01:06:40,311 --> 01:06:42,404
The queen.

743
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:59,324
What's happenin' now? How you doin'?

744
01:07:00,932 --> 01:07:02,923
He's French.

745
01:07:03,534 --> 01:07:05,593
Sir Knolte.

746
01:07:06,571 --> 01:07:08,766
I am pleased to see you.

747
01:07:08,873 --> 01:07:11,671
For all this time, I thought you were dead.

748
01:07:11,742 --> 01:07:14,677
Well, l... was.

749
01:07:14,745 --> 01:07:16,940
Your Majesty, I was.

750
01:07:17,782 --> 01:07:20,751
I beg your forgiveness.
I should not have left you alone.

751
01:07:20,818 --> 01:07:24,310
If you had not, you surely would
have been killed with the others.

752
01:07:24,388 --> 01:07:27,118
I'm therefore grateful that you did.

753
01:07:27,224 --> 01:07:33,493
But now that you've returned from the dead,
it is time to return me to my throne.

754
01:07:33,564 --> 01:07:36,032
Will the men fight again on my behalf?

755
01:07:36,133 --> 01:07:39,364
Oh! I can answer that. Ain't nothin' happenin'.

756
01:07:40,237 --> 01:07:43,729
You know? They draggin' ass.
I asked them that same thing.

757
01:07:43,841 --> 01:07:47,641
They go and act like they ain't hear me,
didn't they, Knolte?

758
01:07:47,778 --> 01:07:54,206
This is my friend Sky Walker, a man
of unconventional wisdom and courage.

759
01:07:55,219 --> 01:07:57,346
What do you think, Sky Walker?

760
01:07:57,421 --> 01:08:01,858
I think they're gonna need a pep talk. You
know what I'm sayin', Your Highnessness?

761
01:08:01,926 --> 01:08:04,986
They gonna be needin' a major pep talk.
Gotta get up in here.

762
01:08:05,096 --> 01:08:08,930
My queen could inspire the stars
to fall from the heavens.

763
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:15,769
Gather the men, that I might give some words
to stir the soul and burn the blood.

764
01:08:26,951 --> 01:08:32,981
England!

765
01:08:33,891 --> 01:08:38,419
Sceptered isle of lute and chattel,

766
01:08:39,196 --> 01:08:42,688
Void your rheum upon my bosom!

767
01:08:43,734 --> 01:08:48,330
Oh, England!

768
01:08:48,639 --> 01:08:53,372
I've heard enough.
Oh, England!

769
01:08:54,211 --> 01:08:56,975
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

770
01:08:57,114 --> 01:09:01,141
Why don't you let me give it a try?
See if I can give 'em the ol' Al Sharpton.

771
01:09:05,690 --> 01:09:08,124
Well, uh...

772
01:09:08,993 --> 01:09:12,656
There once was a great king!

773
01:09:14,699 --> 01:09:16,963
Rodney King,

774
01:09:17,068 --> 01:09:20,094
Who said "Ow, ow, ow!"

775
01:09:20,171 --> 01:09:22,969
"Officer Allen, ow!"

776
01:09:23,074 --> 01:09:26,339
"Get 'em off... Ow! Bzz! Agh!"

777
01:09:27,178 --> 01:09:31,979
And who also said
"Can't we all just get along?"

778
01:09:32,349 --> 01:09:34,544
We need a knight, not a jester.

779
01:09:34,618 --> 01:09:38,349
I'm gonna go and start diggin' our graves.

780
01:09:39,223 --> 01:09:43,387
Well, I say sometimes we can't just get along!

781
01:09:43,494 --> 01:09:46,156
Sometimes we gotta take up arms!

782
01:09:50,334 --> 01:09:52,199
Look.

783
01:09:53,003 --> 01:09:55,096
Hear what I'm sayin'.

784
01:09:56,207 --> 01:09:58,300
Your lives are shitty.

785
01:09:59,443 --> 01:10:02,435
I know because I've been there.

786
01:10:02,546 --> 01:10:05,606
I know the feeling of
waitin' for your ship to come in

787
01:10:05,716 --> 01:10:09,152
And you're standing
in the middle of the desert.

788
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:12,383
Oh, England, you lost your kingdom.

789
01:10:13,023 --> 01:10:16,550
You live in huts. You look like hell.

790
01:10:17,795 --> 01:10:20,320
Well, you do! Check your feet out.

791
01:10:20,397 --> 01:10:23,127
Look at your feet. Mm-Hm, see?

792
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:27,159
Restore this lovely queen to her throne.

793
01:10:27,571 --> 01:10:33,441
Cos when you can do that, she promises
that there will be a horse in every stable,

794
01:10:33,544 --> 01:10:36,741
A chicken in every pot.
That's right. Mm!

795
01:10:37,982 --> 01:10:40,280
Can I get an "amen"?

796
01:10:41,952 --> 01:10:45,285
I said, can I get an "amen"?!

797
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:47,221
Amen.

798
01:10:47,291 --> 01:10:50,021
Can I get an "amen"?!

799
01:10:50,094 --> 01:10:53,063
Amen! Amen!

800
01:10:53,297 --> 01:10:55,390
King Leo.

801
01:10:56,667 --> 01:10:58,862
He thinks he's King Arthur.

802
01:10:58,969 --> 01:11:01,369
Well, I know King Arthur.

803
01:11:01,438 --> 01:11:06,432
And you, King Leo, are no King Arthur!

804
01:11:06,544 --> 01:11:09,104
No King Arthur, indeed!

805
01:11:09,713 --> 01:11:13,945
No King Arthur! No King Arthur!

806
01:11:15,386 --> 01:11:20,756
Ask not what your fiefdom could do for you,

807
01:11:20,825 --> 01:11:24,056
But what you could do for your fiefdom!

808
01:11:34,633 --> 01:11:37,830
Now, Sir Knolte, bring me back my crown.

809
01:11:37,936 --> 01:11:39,961
Your Majesty, it will be an honor.

810
01:11:41,740 --> 01:11:43,207
King Leo got a great big castle..

811
01:11:43,275 --> 01:11:45,539
King Leo got a great big castle...

812
01:11:45,611 --> 01:11:47,579
And we're gonna shove it
right up his asshole...

813
01:11:47,646 --> 01:11:50,012
We're gonna shove it right up his asshole...

814
01:11:50,082 --> 01:11:52,209
Sound off
One, two...

815
01:11:52,284 --> 01:11:55,344
Bring it on down.
Huh, huh, huh-Huh

816
01:12:01,827 --> 01:12:04,489
Yeah, that's tight! Right to the chest.

817
01:12:05,163 --> 01:12:07,222
I'm lovin' it!
Tight.

818
01:12:09,368 --> 01:12:10,995
That's tight.

819
01:12:12,304 --> 01:12:13,965
Yeah, yeah! Get it! Get it!

820
01:12:17,976 --> 01:12:20,410
Try not to mount his ass next time.

821
01:12:24,049 --> 01:12:25,175
Ooh! Oh!

822
01:12:25,250 --> 01:12:27,047
One, two, three. Yes!

823
01:12:30,222 --> 01:12:31,189
Set!

824
01:12:31,256 --> 01:12:33,850
Eight! Shift! 27 blue!

825
01:12:37,996 --> 01:12:41,523
Oh! Lovin' it, yeah! See what I'm sayin'?

826
01:12:42,534 --> 01:12:45,025
Splendid.
Yeah, that's tight.

827
01:13:00,485 --> 01:13:03,079
Here you go, man.
What are these?

828
01:13:03,155 --> 01:13:07,353
Some new jumps, for when
you lead your troops tomorrow.

829
01:13:07,426 --> 01:13:12,386
Thought it might be easier for you to get
around if your feet didn't weigh 500 pounds.

830
01:13:13,765 --> 01:13:15,926
I thank you.
It's all good.

831
01:13:16,802 --> 01:13:19,032
I, too, have something for you. John!

832
01:13:20,305 --> 01:13:23,900
What's this?
A knight must be properly attired.

833
01:13:24,309 --> 01:13:26,300
You and I both know I'm no knight.

834
01:13:26,378 --> 01:13:31,213
You're as much a knight as any man I know,
should you so choose.

835
01:13:33,919 --> 01:13:35,978
Sleep well.

836
01:14:45,857 --> 01:14:49,349
The portcullis is open, unguarded!

837
01:14:55,634 --> 01:14:59,126
Where is Percival?
Where are the guards?

838
01:15:15,554 --> 01:15:17,613
Knolte!

839
01:15:32,571 --> 01:15:34,766
Be brave, lads!

840
01:15:36,942 --> 01:15:39,240
Hold the line!

841
01:16:02,968 --> 01:16:04,458
Slaughter them!

842
01:16:58,156 --> 01:17:00,989
It's the Black Knight! The Black Knight!

843
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:03,521
He lives!

844
01:17:08,733 --> 01:17:11,099
It's the Black Knight!

845
01:17:33,992 --> 01:17:36,085
The Black Knight!
I can't believe it!

846
01:17:36,161 --> 01:17:38,026
It's him! He lives!

847
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:50,701
It's the Moor!

848
01:17:50,775 --> 01:17:53,005
Yah!

849
01:18:20,972 --> 01:18:22,405
Blue 27!

850
01:18:22,507 --> 01:18:24,475
Set! Hut, hut, hut!

851
01:18:27,312 --> 01:18:29,872
Yeah, yeah!
Whoo!

852
01:18:36,988 --> 01:18:39,354
Aagh!

853
01:19:08,586 --> 01:19:11,180
I'll take him.
Good idea.

854
01:19:19,531 --> 01:19:20,589
Is that all you got?

855
01:19:23,068 --> 01:19:25,536
I pray you, is that all you possess?

856
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:26,898
Huh?

857
01:19:32,177 --> 01:19:33,576
Phillip!

858
01:19:36,815 --> 01:19:40,808
The kingdom is falling!
Be not afeard. I have everything in hand.

859
01:19:40,919 --> 01:19:44,616
Are you mad? You must help me flee.
You must get me to safety.

860
01:19:44,723 --> 01:19:46,816
Shut up!

861
01:19:46,925 --> 01:19:48,722
Aaah!

862
01:19:58,503 --> 01:20:00,937
Ha-Ha-Ha! Boo-Yeah!

863
01:20:03,608 --> 01:20:05,007
Watch your step!

864
01:20:08,213 --> 01:20:10,613
Ha-Ha-Ha! Good, eh?

865
01:20:14,386 --> 01:20:16,946
And that, my friend, is the Rope-A-Dope.

866
01:20:23,328 --> 01:20:28,459
Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about!
Hey, Knolte, you the man! Yeah!

867
01:20:38,276 --> 01:20:40,176
Knolte!

868
01:20:44,015 --> 01:20:46,279
Knolte!

869
01:20:46,818 --> 01:20:48,979
You're a brave knight.

870
01:20:49,053 --> 01:20:51,385
It's been an honor fighting beside you.

871
01:20:52,056 --> 01:20:54,354
Take this.

872
01:20:55,427 --> 01:20:57,418
You know what to do.

873
01:21:11,810 --> 01:21:14,142
The Black Knight.

874
01:21:14,212 --> 01:21:17,375
Drop the sword, or I kill the girl.

875
01:21:17,449 --> 01:21:20,418
Let her go.
Do it!

876
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:24,781
Don't do it, Jamal!

877
01:21:32,230 --> 01:21:33,822
So...

878
01:21:35,633 --> 01:21:38,124
Now the Moor's a swordsman.

879
01:22:06,764 --> 01:22:09,790
Now you shall die at my hands, as Knolte did.

880
01:22:29,787 --> 01:22:30,981
Ohh!

881
01:22:33,124 --> 01:22:35,058
Let me ask you somethin'.

882
01:22:35,159 --> 01:22:37,389
You like baseball?

883
01:22:40,565 --> 01:22:42,430
Or maybe you like basketball?

884
01:22:48,373 --> 01:22:50,204
Maybe golf?

885
01:22:55,647 --> 01:22:58,582
You can thank Tiger for that.

886
01:23:02,887 --> 01:23:05,151
You OK?
I'm sure I'll be fine.

887
01:23:05,990 --> 01:23:09,118
How's your neck?
You were very brave.

888
01:23:17,569 --> 01:23:19,628
Let me help you up.

889
01:23:21,439 --> 01:23:23,339
Jamal!

890
01:24:03,348 --> 01:24:05,316
Knolte!

891
01:24:12,890 --> 01:24:15,984
Long live the queen!

892
01:24:17,595 --> 01:24:20,792
Yes! Yes!

893
01:24:22,967 --> 01:24:26,733
Yes! Knolte!

894
01:24:31,142 --> 01:24:34,134
We'll have an amazing
life together. You'll love LA.

895
01:24:34,212 --> 01:24:37,306
But I was thinking...
I'm not goin' back without you.

896
01:24:37,382 --> 01:24:39,816
You know, I'd go to
the end of the earth for you.

897
01:24:39,917 --> 01:24:42,351
That's only six miles from here.

898
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:44,445
You've got a lot to learn.

899
01:24:44,555 --> 01:24:47,456
Teach me.
You want me to teach you?

900
01:24:58,936 --> 01:25:01,996
'Tis a strange way to...
It's French.

901
01:25:02,106 --> 01:25:04,165
Oh!

902
01:25:07,558 --> 01:25:10,527
Sky Walker, are you both
still determined to leave us?

903
01:25:10,628 --> 01:25:13,256
We hate to lose such a brave warrior.

904
01:25:14,899 --> 01:25:17,493
Nothin' personal, uh, Miss Queen.

905
01:25:19,036 --> 01:25:21,504
But, uh, Knolte's right.

906
01:25:21,572 --> 01:25:23,870
I got my own battles to fight, you know?

907
01:25:29,446 --> 01:25:32,347
That's my bun. You hooked me up with her.

908
01:25:34,585 --> 01:25:40,251
She knew I was down with somebody cool,
so she started likin' me.

909
01:26:00,077 --> 01:26:02,875
In acknowledgment for
your service to the Crown,

910
01:26:02,947 --> 01:26:08,146
I dub thee Sir Sky Walker, the Black Knight.

911
01:26:15,626 --> 01:26:17,617
Clear.

912
01:26:24,168 --> 01:26:25,931
Clear!

913
01:26:27,171 --> 01:26:30,140
What...?
His vital signs appear normal.

914
01:26:31,275 --> 01:26:33,766
Jamal! Jamal!

915
01:26:33,878 --> 01:26:35,743
Yo, you OK, man?

916
01:26:35,846 --> 01:26:41,079
You scared the hell outta me! You was
under that water for, like, ten minutes!

917
01:26:41,385 --> 01:26:45,321
Hey. Yo, where's Victoria? Vicky?

918
01:26:45,890 --> 01:26:48,586
Who?
Stop playin', man!

919
01:26:48,692 --> 01:26:51,183
Vicky. Victoria, my bun!

920
01:26:52,196 --> 01:26:55,131
Jamal, what you talkin' about, man?

921
01:26:56,367 --> 01:26:58,460
What...? Vicky?

922
01:27:18,956 --> 01:27:22,722
Dude, you know, a workplace
accident like this, we can sue.

923
01:27:24,161 --> 01:27:27,096
There ain't no honor in that, man.

924
01:27:29,433 --> 01:27:31,526
Don't think I don't know what you doin'.

925
01:27:31,635 --> 01:27:35,867
You fake you some accident, get you
a lawyer and walk away with my money.

926
01:27:35,940 --> 01:27:40,240
Well, it won't work! And I already
went ahead and took your advice.

927
01:27:40,311 --> 01:27:42,279
What advice?
I quit.

928
01:27:42,346 --> 01:27:45,747
Oh, Mrs Bostick, you can't quit.

929
01:27:45,849 --> 01:27:50,047
OK? We can work it out.
We just gotta fight, that's all.

930
01:27:50,688 --> 01:27:52,713
You on the pipe?

931
01:27:52,790 --> 01:27:54,883
Mrs Bostick, look, um...

932
01:27:56,694 --> 01:28:02,496
I know things can get a little scary,
but courage isn't the absence of fear.

933
01:28:03,534 --> 01:28:08,130
It is the presence of fear, yet the will to go on.

934
01:28:12,109 --> 01:28:14,703
Good, good! I'm lovin' it!

935
01:28:14,812 --> 01:28:17,645
How's the babies? Everybody's good? Good.

936
01:28:17,715 --> 01:28:19,808
Oh, this is lovely.

937
01:28:20,351 --> 01:28:22,683
How you doin', my queen?

938
01:28:22,753 --> 01:28:25,119
I always knew you had it in you, Jamal.

939
01:28:25,222 --> 01:28:27,281
Well, I'm just glad you like it.

940
01:28:27,424 --> 01:28:29,483
I love it.
Good, good.

941
01:28:33,564 --> 01:28:36,897
No, no, you can't be scared of it. Try it again.

942
01:28:41,305 --> 01:28:44,240
Oh, lovin' it!
Way to go, Bobby!

943
01:28:49,513 --> 01:28:53,916
Thanks. I think that's
the first time he actually hit the ball.

944
01:28:58,355 --> 01:29:00,687
You look familiar.

945
01:29:01,592 --> 01:29:04,083
So do you. Uh...

946
01:29:06,196 --> 01:29:10,530
Name's Jamal.
Nicole. My friends call me Nicky.

947
01:29:11,335 --> 01:29:15,203
I work in admissions up at the college.
Is that where we met?

948
01:29:15,873 --> 01:29:18,706
Maybe. I registered for some night classes.

949
01:29:21,478 --> 01:29:23,537
Can I ask you where you got that scar?

950
01:29:23,647 --> 01:29:26,275
This? Oh, it's from a long, long time ago.

951
01:29:26,350 --> 01:29:31,811
Well, maybe I could take you out to lunch.
You could tell me all about it.

952
01:29:31,889 --> 01:29:34,858
I'd like that... very much.

953
01:29:34,925 --> 01:29:37,485
All right. Good.

954
01:29:39,496 --> 01:29:42,226
Hey, Aunt Nicky?
I gotta go.

955
01:29:43,133 --> 01:29:46,261
Yeah, well, uh, it's nice meetin' you.

956
01:29:51,442 --> 01:29:53,706
I... I didn't get your number!

957
01:29:54,978 --> 01:29:57,071
Excuse me. Yeah.

958
01:30:19,736 --> 01:30:21,897
Release the lions!

959
01:30:22,305 --> 01:31:22,392
