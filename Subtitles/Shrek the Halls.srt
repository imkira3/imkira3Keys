2
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,872
There. That's better.

3
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,554
All clean.

4
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,520
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're awake

5
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,880
What are you doing here?

6
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,440
–And what are you talking about?
–I'm talkin' about Santa Claus!

7
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,720
Only 159 days left till
Christmas, so you better be good.

8
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,480
I'd better be good? How 'bout this? You
better be scarce. Now go on.

9
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,434
I don't care about Christmas.

10
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,240
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way

11
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,240
–Donkey!
–51 days till Christmas.

12
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,680
Get your butt in gear
and get marshmallows,

13
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,840
because without marshmallows,
sweet potatoes are nothin'!

14
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,998
Enough! I don't care
about any of this nonsense.

15
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,115
Now shoo!

16
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,170
OK. But don't say
I didn't say I told you so.

17
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,240
Smashing through the snow
And laughin' all the way

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,184
It's finally here.
Tomorrow's Christmas Eve!

19
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,520
–Everything ready?
–No.

20
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,240
You haven't trimmed stockings,
hung your chestnuts, roasted the tree?

21
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,720
–Orfiggified your puddin'?
–Donkey! Get it through your head.

22
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,991
No one here gives
a hoot about Christmas!

23
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,878
A white Christmas!
How perfect.

24
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,480
And it's our first one together
as a family. Isn't this exciting?

25
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,988
Oh, yeah!
How 'bout that?

26
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,040
There's somethin' Shrek needs to…

27
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,280
Don't ruin the surprise
for her, Donkey.

28
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,153
Surprise?
Oh, I love surprises!

29
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,738
You're the best. Come on,
let's go make some cookies.

30
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,044
OK, you a dead man.
You know that?

31
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,588
Hold that thought.
I'll be right back.

32
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,310
Good. You're still open.

33
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,358
No, no. We're closing now.
Merry Christmas.

34
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,440
Wait! I need your help.
I have to make a Christmas,

35
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,040
and I have no idea
what it is or how to do it!

36
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,080
Why didn't you say so?
That's super.

37
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,800
I know all about Christmas,
and I've just the book.

38
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,800
Christmas for Village Idiots.
It's all spelled out. See?

39
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,360
One, decorate house.
Two, stockings by the fireplace.

40
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,630
Step three, the Christmas feast.

41
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,200
–What's that?
–Step four? The Christmas tree!

42
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,286
The tree goes inside the house?

43
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,359
Anyway, step five, the telling
of the Christmas story.

44
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,040
It's the step that says
I created the perfect Christmas

45
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,800
for my perfect family perfectly.
Family by the fire,

46
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,200
everyone cosy and warm.
Happy, happy. Voilà!

47
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,549
–Sure.
–Long story short,

48
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,560
it's all right here.
It's no problem.

49
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,114
–Perfect.
–I mean, how hard can it be?

50
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,280
–I didn't get the eggnog!
–Closed⁈ What do you mean?

51
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,550
Dwight the Knight action figure?

52
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,280
Sweet potatoes are nothing
without marshmallows!

53
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,432
Bye-bye. Have a super Christmas.

54
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,075
Honey, is that you?

55
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,350
Fiona! What are
you doing up so early?

56
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,959
–Are you OK?
–I'm all right.

57
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,192
What are you…? Are you decorating?

58
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,798
–Yeah, that. Surprised?
–Yes.

59
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,120
Well, this is our first
Christmas together as a family,

60
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,320
and, you know, I just want to
make sure that it's perfect.

61
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,352
Shrek, I think… it's beautiful.

62
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,320
–It's passable.
–It's horrible!

63
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,720
–Donkey!
–They usually toilet paper and run.

64
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,400
Whoever did this means business!
Get rid of all this

65
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,440
and get tinsel and doilies and ribbons

66
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,960
and some plastic reindeer.

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,848
What is it you wanted today?

68
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,960
It's Christmas Eve!
I've brought you a little somethin'.

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,440
Go ahead, take a couple.
I bought plenty for everybody!

70
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,471
Isn't that… nice.

71
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,880
Well, thanks for stopping by for that
brief visit, but as you can see,

72
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,600
there's a lot of work to do.

73
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,680
Just like him to wait till last minute.

74
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,320
Don't worry, the one thing
I know is Christmas.

75
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,320
He's gonna want help, advice,
and he's definitely…

76
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,115
Actually, I think what he really wants
is a nice family Christmas.

77
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,476
Oh, a family Christmas.

78
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,560
Yeah. It's the
first one with the kids.

79
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,960
Don't say a word.
I know exactly what you mean.

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,400
I got a lot to do now,
so I better get movin'.

81
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,760
Thank you, Donkey!
And Merry Christmas!

82
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,360
All right. Merry Christmas!

83
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,949
Love and joy come to you
and to me some waffles too

84
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,120
Donkey's right. It's Christmas Eve.

85
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,800
How am I ever gonna
get this done in time?

86
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,120
This is gonna be
the best Christmas ever.

87
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,196
And we're going to do it together,
so come on.

88
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,638
Everything looks so good!

89
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,233
Nice job, honey.

90
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,515
Well, we all did it together.

91
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,956
Now what would the perfect Christmas
be without a Christmas story?

92
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,678
'Twas the night before Christmas
and all through the house

93
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,991
Not a creature was stirring…
What?

94
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,588
–Merry Christmas, Shrek!
–Oh, not you!

95
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,640
We're here to smother you with love!

96
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,319
Absolutely not!
Bad Donkey! Go home!

97
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,680
How are you gonna have
Christmas without family?

98
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,640
–Seasons greeting!
–Happy Holidays!

99
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,600
–Merry Christmas!
–A nice surprise!

100
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,959
Oh, yeah.

101
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,356
OK, I will assume the position.

102
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:30,556
–I am the joy-filled swine!
–Yay, for the season of love!

103
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,996
This is for stockings.
You can't hang laundry up!

104
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,071
Donkey! Don't touch anything.

105
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,680
How we gonna roast chestnuts
on this little bitty fire?

106
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,040
Hey, baby, you mind?

107
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,394
–Oh, boy!
–This way, gents.

108
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,360
That was our supper!

109
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,034
Hey!

110
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,160
Did you hurt yourself
when you fell out of heaven?

111
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,560
–Where are we going to put it?
–I don't know.

112
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,600
Let's put it over here.
No, that is not with the feng shui.

113
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,752
Come on, everybody, let's dance!

114
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,036
–Occupied!
–It's me. Shrek?

115
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,749
–Yes?
–Come back to the party. Please?

116
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,880
I don't think
that'd be such a good idea.

117
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,435
Come on. It's not that bad.

118
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,292
OK, I know you're
not a party person, but…

119
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,640
But what? This is not the
kind of Christmas I had in mind.

120
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,956
They're our friends, Shrek.
They all mean well.

121
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,960
–How many babies did Fiona have?
–She has babies?

122
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,360
–I don't know.
–I better get back to the house.

123
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,440
Surprised we have
a house to go back to.

124
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,711
–Are you coming?
–I can hardly wait.

125
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,552
Finally!

126
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,754
Look at him go!

127
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,592
Excuse me! Excuse me!

128
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,318
Excuse you for what?

129
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,278
I don't feel very good.

130
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,558
–I feel better now.
–A chocolate chip!

131
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,709
Sweetheart?

132
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,839
Mind if I cut in?

133
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,515
Don't stop believing

134
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,673
Up and down the boulevard

135
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,550
I am a little Christmas angel!

136
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,517
Hey there, my sweeties.

137
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,070
Would you like Daddy
to finish the story for you?

138
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,309
Yeah?

139
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,120
The children were nestled
all snug in their beds,

140
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,400
while visions of sugarplums…
–Were you tellin' 'em

141
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,320
The Night Before Christmas?
Best Christmas story ever!

142
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,360
–I'm the best teller ever!
–Donkey…

143
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,280
I got it committed
to memorisation!

144
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,000
–Gather round!
–Donkey! Wait!

145
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,280
I'm supposed to tell
the Christmas story.

146
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,200
'Twas the night before Christmas
and I spent all the day

147
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,993
Finishin' up on my Christmas display

148
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,600
Now, missin' all this
would be nothin' but tragic

149
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,320
So just follow me
and I'll show you the magic

150
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,480
Now, out in the yard
in a glorious clutter

151
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,240
Is a spectacle there that'll
make your heart flutter

152
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,440
With 20-foot cheese balls
and a big eggnog fountain

153
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,760
And yodelin' elves
on an ambrosia mountain

154
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,240
A stage where acrobats
jump, leap and prance

155
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,272
And honour the day
through interpretive dance

156
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,480
Just when you think
the display is complete

157
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,040
The Christmas parade
comes right down the street

158
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,360
With holiday floats
all in silver and blue

159
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,312
With sugarplum fairies
and a reindeer or two

160
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,160
There's a baton-twirlin'
snowman all happy and perky

161
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,038
Magical peacocks
and a dancin' roast turkey

162
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,440
And right when you think
that you've just seen it all

163
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,155
Comes a huge waffle Santa
that's 50 feet tall

164
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,629
Ho, ho, ho!

165
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,440
With syrup and butter
the sight just amazes

166
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,780
As it's flanked by a choir
all singin' his praises

167
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,434
–Donkey.
–Santa?

168
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,714
–Donkey!
–Santa!

169
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,631
Donkey!

170
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,792
Very inappropriate, amigo.
Please, allow me.

171
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,280
–Oh, Puss, not you too.
–In my homeland,

172
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,160
we tell a very different tale
of the Santa Nicholas.

173
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,430
He's not made of waffles.

174
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,592
This Santa was suave
He was nothing like that

175
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,719
The Santa I know
was a hot Latin cat

176
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,634
He was dressed all in fur
from his head to his paws

177
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,953
And he stood there heroic
A real Santa… Claws

178
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,474
Red are his boots

179
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,279
–And so is his cape.
–Οii!

180
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,194
His sword is a cane
that tastes like crab cake

181
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,720
He wears a fine belt
and a leather cravat

182
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,072
And there's a cute fuzzy thing
which hangs down from his hat

183
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,828
I have shamed myself.

184
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,036
–Oii!
–All right, everybody,

185
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,880
if you leave now,
you can beat the holiday traffic.

186
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,760
Phooey with all your
sunshine and lollipops!

187
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,110
Where I come from,
Christmas is a nightmare.

188
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,680
'Twas the night before Christmas
and the prettiest sights

189
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,679
Were my sweetheart beside me
in the bright Christmas lights

190
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,352
until they got home.

191
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,752
When they looked at the car door
handle, and they found a hook!

192
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,320
Gingy, cut it out! You're
really givin' me the creeps!

193
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,113
Oh, come on,
I was just teasin'.

194
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,953
Come here, you.

195
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,080
Gingy, I couldn't stay mad at you.

196
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,678
What was that?

197
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,400
Oh, no, you don't. I'm not
fallin' for that again.

198
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,410
No, I'm really, really
seriously not kidding.

199
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,069
Gingy!

200
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,793
Suzie!

201
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,148
No! No! No!

202
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,840
That's the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard.

203
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,160
–That's not how it goes.
–You weren't there!

204
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,368
All right, everyone,
I've had just about enough!

205
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,473
All I wanted was a nice
Christmas with my family.

206
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,640
That's exactly why we're all here!
Come on, let's finish tellin' my story.

207
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,037
No, Donkey, that's not what I meant.
And get out of my chair.

208
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,877
–Hey, what's this?
–Donkey, let go of the book.

209
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,920
–Why are you whisperin'?
–I'm not kiddin'. Give me the book!

210
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,635
–Heimlich!
–Ja?

211
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,438
–No, Heimlich!
–Oh, ja!

212
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,075
My eye!

213
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,000
Stop, drop and roll, Shrek!

214
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,120
–Somebody get some water!
–I got it!

215
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,840
Don't worry, Shrek,
everything is under control!

216
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,438
Oh, boy.

217
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,629
–The tea is ready.
–Out!

218
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,633
I want everybody out
of my house right now!

219
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,680
Well, that's a real nice way
to treat your guests on Christmas!

220
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,604
And if you think I'm gonna give you
a present now, you are sadly mistaken!

221
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,120
You want to give me a present?
Then go away!

222
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,993
–That's all I wanted!
–Fine! I'm going!

223
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,354
Good, then go!

224
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,035
You go and have yourself
a merry Christmas.

225
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,590
–Ebenezer Shrek!
–And a “Bah, humbug” to you too!

226
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,960
–We could come to our house.
–We have plenty of schnitzel.

227
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,116
Now maybe we can…

228
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,829
Fiona? Where you going?

229
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,356
Shrek, you just kicked
everybody out on Christmas.

230
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,840
Well, that wasn't Christmas.
That was chaos!

231
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,678
Look, I know it didn't
go like you wanted.

232
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,520
What I wanted was a perfect
Christmas for me and my family.

233
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,120
–That was our family.
–You call that a family?

234
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,230
That was a natural disaster!

235
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,160
On Christmas, that's how it
works. Yes, it was crowded.

236
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,240
Yes, it got
a little out of hand.

237
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,431
–Fiona, they lit me on fire!
–Shrek…

238
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:32,040
I had everything under control until
they showed up and ruined my Christmas!

239
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,231
–Your Christmas?
–I mean our Christmas.

240
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,788
For you, and the babies.

241
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,715
Christmas is not just about
you or me. Or even the babies.

242
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,832
You just don't get it.

243
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,994
I have to go. I need to
apologise to our friends.

244
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,036
Fiona, wait.

245
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,160
I don't understand why
Shrek had to be so mean and cranky.

246
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,080
We were tryin' to do what you wanted!

247
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,080
–What're you talking about?
–What you said this morning.

248
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,760
You and Shrek wanted to
have a big family Christmas.

249
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,600
I said it was our first
Christmas together as a family.

250
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,720
Right. That's me and everybody else.

251
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,560
Then he lost his temper like that.

252
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,800
You know, Donkey, none of us
really asked Shrek what he wanted.

253
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,760
I must agree with the Princess.
And you, were no Christmas angel.

254
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,640
–I don't remember askin' you anything!
–Donkey.

255
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,433
I'm sorry, Princess. You're right.

256
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,292
–Still, Shrek didn't have to be so…
–What?

257
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,599
Pigheaded? Stubborn? Mean?

258
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,470
Well, maybe I am all those
things, but I'm an ogre, OK?

259
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,199
So here's the thing.

260
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,920
I'm sorry you took getting kicked out
of my house the wrong way.

261
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,589
No, wait. What I meant to say is

262
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,600
I know you're just trying to be
helpful in your irritating fashion…

263
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,713
–Ay, caramba!
–Some people can't help being annoying.

264
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,792
–Shrek!
–Look,

265
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,992
I shouldn't have lost my temper.

266
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,680
–Apology accepted. Let's eat.
–Wait a minute.

267
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,760
There's somethin' more to this.
Come on, what's goin' on?

268
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,271
Look, all I wanted was to make
this perfect for my family,

269
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,353
but I don't even know
what Christmas means.

270
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,591
The thing is,
this is my first Christmas too.

271
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,960
Hold up, Shrek! You mean
that you never had…

272
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,080
–No.
–Not even one?

273
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,640
–No!
–You mean no chestnuts,

274
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,600
no Santa, no presents,
no stockings?

275
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,790
–No nut cakes⁈
–Donkey!

276
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,077
No, none of that.

277
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,436
Ogres don't celebrate Christmas.

278
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,557
Ogres don't celebrate anything.

279
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,879
Oh, man, now I'm all emotional.

280
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,960
–Come here, gimme a hug!
–All right, that's close enough.

281
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,600
OK, all right, I just…
guess I got… a little

282
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,760
excited about Christmas and
all the presents and mistletoe

283
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,792
and everything,
and I forgot that it's…

284
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,480
It's about us all bein' together,
and I'm… I'm sorry, Shrek.

285
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,480
I know, Donkey, and… and I'm sorry
it ended up in a great big fight.

286
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,160
Christmas is all about fights.

287
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,800
My mama used to say, “Christmas ain't
Christmas till somebody cries”.

288
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,440
Usually that someone's me.

289
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,200
There is no right way to
do Christmas. You just do it.

290
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,673
Ja, with schnitzel!

291
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,591
–And eggnog!
–And cheese!

292
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,798
–And family.
–Yeah. And family.

293
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,919
So despite the fact that you
drive me crazy at times…

294
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,514
Yes, Donkey, I'm lookin' at you.

295
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,071
it would mean a lot to me if
you'd all come back and join us.

296
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,598
OK, I guess I deserved that.

297
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,079
Don't push your luck.

298
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,355
They got you good, Shrek!

299
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,908
That wasn't even funny!
Who did that?

300
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,104
Well, that's the last
of the spare blankets.

301
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,844
Sorry, but this is my spot. I never get
the good spots, so I specifically…

302
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,757
So we are pigs,
pigs in the blanket, ja?

303
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,159
–Ja.
–Ja.

304
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,470
–This is funny then, ja?
–Ja, ja.

305
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,760
–This is funny.
–Ja.

306
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,440
–Yep, that's a good one.
–Good night, everyone.

307
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,320
–It's time for lights out.
–We can't go to sleep yet.

308
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,640
We haven't heard a bedtime story. Right?

309
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,669
Shrek, yeah!

310
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,157
All right. All right.

311
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,199
Don't need this.

312
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,949
OK.

313
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,592
'Twas the night before Christmas

314
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,830
Not a swamp rat did creep

315
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,956
As mother and babe
played kazoo in their sleep

316
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,080
Now, the sight of the house
would make any ogre droop

317
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,476
For 'twas sickeningly sweet
as unicorn poop

318
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,950
Yet who was arriving
to help this lost cause?

319
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:32,591
The foul, the vile
and handsome Ogre Claus

320
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,079
Hey. How's it goin'?

321
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,840
He looked all around
and scratched at his beard

322
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,677
And said…

323
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,990
And said…

324
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,436
This place is worse
than I thought… feared.

325
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,640
So he grabbed up his belly
and screwed up his face

326
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,736
And let loose a…

327
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,951
That transformed the place

328
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,112
With a gleam in his eye
his work here was done

329
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,317
And then to the babies
he gave one by one

330
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,198
A festering bottle
of stinky swamp juice

331
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,716
And for mommy a kiss
and a good Christmas goose

332
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,760
Four hundred twenty five degrees,
20 minutes per pound.

333
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,951
Then digging a finger
inside of his nose

334
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,113
And giving a nod
up the chimney he rose

335
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,909
And I heard him exclaim
as he drove out of sight

336
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,233
“Smelly Christmas to all,
and to all a gross night!”

337
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,515
Ho, ho, ho!

338
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,511
Ho, ho, ho!

339
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,512
–Ho, ho, ho!
–Santa⁈

340
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,398
Ho, ho, ho!

341
00:20:39,305 --> 00:21:39,669
