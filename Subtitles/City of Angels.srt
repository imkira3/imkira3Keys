2
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,023
I don't...

3
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:25,775
I don't really pray...

4
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:28,986
...but if you could just
help me out here...

5
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:30,530
...I promise...

6
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:35,284
105.

7
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:37,286
105?

8
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,330
Oh, my God! Okay.

9
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:41,416
Okay, run a bath, call the doctor.

10
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:44,043
Just run a bath, get her into the bath.

11
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,379
Dr. Carter, 655...

12
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,089
Oh, he won't be there.

13
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:49,799
What is a thermometer?
Mercury.

14
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:53,594
How does it even work?
Maybe I can page him.

15
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:55,805
Susan. Susie.

16
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,725
Mommy needs you to get up now.

17
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,561
- Cold.
- I know, I know.

18
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:03,229
Okay, hang on.

19
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:04,814
Hang on.

20
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:06,232
Cold!

21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,026
It just feels cold because you're so hot.

22
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:12,488
Susan. Susan, stay with me. Susan.

23
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:13,740
Susan!

24
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:19,036
Has she been disoriented? Confused?

25
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:22,665
She said that she saw
a man in her bedroom.

26
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,962
Are you cold?

27
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:32,175
Okay, swing it.

28
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:34,385
- Move it, people.
- Is Room 2 clear?

29
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:35,803
Yes, it's clear.

30
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:37,680
Get her pressure.

31
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,433
- Let's give her O2. Ten liters.
- Yes, doctor.

32
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,143
Tap her right away.

33
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,069
How's her breathing?

34
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:16,093
No pulse or rhythm.

35
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,096
Are you God?

36
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,308
No.

37
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:23,684
My name is Seth.

38
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:25,478
Where are we going?

39
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,230
Home.

40
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,816
Can Mommy come?

41
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:31,776
No.

42
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:42,286
She won't understand.

43
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,330
She will...

44
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,123
...someday.

45
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,716
Can I ask you something?

46
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,385
Yes.

47
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,179
What did you like best?

48
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,182
Pajamas.

49
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:32,003
She definitely knew what she liked.

50
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:35,715
- Pajamas?
- Flannel, with feet.

51
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:37,884
Pajamas.

52
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,553
Excellent choice. What else?

53
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,723
In the elevator of
the Bradbury Building...

54
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:47,685
...a man touched a woman's
bare skin by accident...

55
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:50,855
...but it made her turn and look at him
in such a way...

56
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:54,275
And they?

57
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,861
- Yes.
- Ah.

58
00:03:57,029 --> 00:03:58,946
It was a good day.

59
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:01,741
Do you ever wonder
what that would be like?

60
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,492
Touch?

61
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:05,411
No.

62
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,538
Yes, you do.

63
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,626
Occasionally. Yes.

64
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,378
Touch.

65
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:35,524
I'm not asking for it every night.
Just twice a week.

66
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:38,486
Blue eyes. He's never going to leave her.

67
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:42,490
Twenty minutes.
Everything in this damn city is 20 minutes.

68
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,408
It's never 20 minutes.

69
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:09,892
My ass on a stool all day.
She gets the good chair.

70
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:16,524
Six pounds, four ounces.
My daughter has a daughter.

71
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,788
$20,000 at 21 percent.

72
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,000
Pay it off with another card
at 14 percent.

73
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:35,418
Oh, shit!

74
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:40,089
Federal 595 heavy, slow immediately
to match preceding aircraft. Over.

75
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,299
Jesus, wake up! Wake up!

76
00:05:57,441 --> 00:06:00,776
The little girl asked me
if she could be an angel.

77
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,903
They all want wings.

78
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,197
I never know what to say.

79
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,324
Tell them the truth.

80
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,368
Angels aren't human.

81
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,662
We were never human.

82
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,583
What if I just make her
a little pair of wings out of paper?

83
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:17,710
Tell her the truth.

84
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,879
I told her.

85
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,464
And?

86
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,466
How did she take it?

87
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:28,554
She said, "What good would wings be
if you couldn't feel wind on your face?"

88
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:57,500
On the 101
through downtown L.A., no delays...

89
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,544
Shit! Jesus!

90
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:04,757
Get to work!

91
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:10,906
What do we got?

92
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:15,286
50-year-old male had a huge anterior wall MI
this morning. Collapsed while jogging.

93
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,664
Paramedics resuscitated him,
but his EKG's pretty ugly.

94
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,416
He's hypertensive.

95
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,959
This diagonal looks tight.

96
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:24,712
Who cathed him?

97
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,755
Rosenberg.

98
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:30,050
- Be right in.
- The patient wants to meet you.

99
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,773
He's pretty out of it.

100
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:48,569
The doctor's here.

101
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:15,304
- We're just going to cool to 32 today.
- Okay.

102
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,723
Sucker.

103
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:21,852
Jimi.

104
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,370
Vein.

105
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:55,886
Kid started walking.

106
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:58,389
Three unassisted steps.

107
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:02,226
- Get it on video?
- I wasn't even there.

108
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:05,604
You failed as a father already.
How does that feel?

109
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,776
Retrograde on.

110
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,573
Come down to half flow,
give me a little volume.

111
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,450
Down to half flow, here's your volume.

112
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,244
- Ready to come off?
- Ready.

113
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:21,495
Let's come off.

114
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:22,955
We're coming down.

115
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:26,375
We're clamped and off bypass.

116
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,650
Oh, shit.

117
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,361
What are you missing?

118
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,238
Sponge.

119
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,198
Bummer.

120
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,205
Got it!

121
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:12,713
Thank you, everybody.

122
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,965
Presbyterian's on Line 2.

123
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,426
Watch his rhythm.
It's gonna be irritable.

124
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:24,058
- She's getting good, huh?
- She's getting that attitude too.

125
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,893
Getting an attitude?

126
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:29,688
Aw, shit! V-tac!

127
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,398
Christ! Paddles!

128
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,442
Kill the music. Get her back in here.

129
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,944
- Charge to 2.
- Charging 200.

130
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:38,447
- Go, go, go.
- Dr. Rice.

131
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:39,656
Two hundred.

132
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,910
- Ready.
- Clear.

133
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,330
- Ready.
- Clear!

134
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:47,831
V-fib, no pressure.

135
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,917
- You give him lidocaine?
- 100's gone in.

136
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,543
Buzz him again at 300.

137
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,712
- Three hundred.
- Clear.

138
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,547
- Nothing.
- Start compression.

139
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,383
Kill the alarm!

140
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,180
Hold up. It's not working.

141
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,974
Gotta open him.
How long to go back on?

142
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:07,601
It'll take me 10 minutes.

143
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:09,603
Come on. Nothing.

144
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,188
Knife.

145
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,281
Internal paddles. Charge to 20.

146
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,409
- Ready.
- Twenty.

147
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,119
Hit it.

148
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:28,122
- Nada.
- Go to 30.

149
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,998
- Thirty.
- Hit it.

150
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,875
No response.

151
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,836
Tom, I gotta get back on bypass here.

152
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,963
Almost there. Give me 7 more minutes.

153
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,048
Come on. Come on.

154
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,760
Don't do this. Come on.

155
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:44,138
He's going.

156
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,557
He's not going anywhere.

157
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,735
Come on, don't do this! Come on.

158
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,531
Damn it, come on!

159
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,242
Tom.

160
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:10,122
Come on! Come on.

161
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,587
Tom. Come on.

162
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:32,811
Mrs. Balford?

163
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,314
Where's the doctor?

164
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,026
- I'm the doctor.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

165
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,362
I operated on your husband.

166
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,281
How is he?

167
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:47,868
He didn't survive.

168
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:52,414
What?

169
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,294
We were able to restore
blood flow to the heart...

170
00:13:57,462 --> 00:14:00,923
...but he developed a lethal arrhythmia.
We were unable to resuscitate him.

171
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,927
Wait. I'm sorry, I don't understand.
A what?

172
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:09,598
I'm sorry.

173
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,852
But... But...

174
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,854
Do you...?

175
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,940
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm...

176
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,359
- What did you say?
- He's...?

177
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,446
What?

178
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,616
Oh, my God.

179
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,418
- Oh, God.
- Oh, my God.

180
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:59,314
On the table, on my table. I'm sorry.

181
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,108
I'm sorry.

182
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,946
I'm sorry. What happened?
What happened?

183
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:09,074
A graft occlusion? What?

184
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:13,036
It was textbook. It was textbook.

185
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,670
I'm so sorry.

186
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:25,716
The room got so big.
I was so small.

187
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,051
How did I get so small?

188
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,596
I should've gone back on.

189
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,973
I should've massaged longer.

190
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:36,226
I should've gone back on.
I massaged longer. I lost it.

191
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,564
I lost it.

192
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,835
Have you ever been seen, Cassiel?

193
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,503
You're looking at me.

194
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:08,216
No, not by me,
and not by the dying or the delirious.

195
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,178
Have you ever been seen...

196
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,889
...like you were a man?

197
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:19,061
In a diner once, a blind woman
turned to me all of a sudden...

198
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,730
...and asked me to pass her the mustard.

199
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:26,026
- But she was blind.
- But she knew I was there.

200
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,529
That doctor, in the operating room...

201
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:33,492
...she looked right at me.

202
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,328
She didn't see you, Seth.
She can't see you.

203
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,498
No one can see you
unless you want them to.

204
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,124
And if I want her to?

205
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:43,752
Why do you want her to?

206
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,339
To help her.

207
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:49,007
Open it!

208
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,592
Open it now!

209
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,469
Everybody down!

210
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:53,720
Get down!

211
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,348
Do it! Do it!

212
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,392
Shit! Just give him the money.

213
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,269
Did I leave the lights on?
I left the lights on.

214
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:03,438
I should have gone to Ralphs.

215
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,483
- Do it!
- Relax. I'm doing it, okay?

216
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:09,736
I never saw the Grand Canyon.

217
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11,530
I'll never see my grandkids again.

218
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,200
What am I doing?

219
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,994
Just be cool. Be cool.

220
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,333
Be cool, man.

221
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,544
Be cool.

222
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,008
Holy shit.

223
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:35,804
They don't need to see us.

224
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:56,867
Hey, you're early.

225
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,859
What's going on?

226
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:33,403
Ferris was looking for you.

227
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,197
Maggie.

228
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:48,293
- What's going on? I have a mitral valve to do.
- They canceled it.

229
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,087
- Who canceled it?
- Sheffield.

230
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:52,714
Why are you telling me?

231
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:53,924
He was busy.

232
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,467
He was chickenshit.

233
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,719
- Maggie, you're sick.
- I'm not sick.

234
00:18:57,929 --> 00:18:59,554
You're sick and you can't operate.

235
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:02,516
They've rescheduled for Monday.
It's elective. No big deal.

236
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:07,020
It is unprofessional and it embarrasses me
in front of my staff.

237
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:13,068
I saw the chart on Balford.

238
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:15,654
- What?
- I'm on the committee. It's on review.

239
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:18,281
- It wasn't your fault.
- I know.

240
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,950
Then what's the problem?

241
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:25,455
I don't know.

242
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:29,417
Maggie, you put up a terrific fight.

243
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:31,711
Yeah.

244
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,755
We fight for people's lives, right?

245
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:35,674
Uh-huh.

246
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,135
Don't you ever wonder
who it is we're fighting with?

247
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:47,143
- So I'm crazy and I'm chemically imbalanced.
- You're tired.

248
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:49,938
You have moments.

249
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:52,899
Why didn't you call me?

250
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,654
Because I never sleep
when you stay over.

251
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,906
You never sleep whether
I stay over or not.

252
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,410
You're good.

253
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:04,870
You know it.

254
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:07,497
Come back Monday
and get back on the horse.

255
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,166
Doctor?

256
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,425
I'll see you.

257
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:46,161
"...shore of the pond in my shirtsleeves..."

258
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:48,747
"...Amazon basin in the north,
once an island sea..."

259
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,666
"The highest truth on the
subject remains unsaid...

260
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,628
...probably cannot be said."

261
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,090
"Not knowing how to react to
this confinement...

262
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,510
...she begins to pull away from
the awareness she had once exposed...

263
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:05,597
...through her recognition
of external realities."

264
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,142
"Commencing search."
Searching my soul.

265
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,354
What happened to the cards?
You could touch the cards.

266
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,731
She's been looking at me
for the last half-hour.

267
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:16,316
Maybe if I just hang here...

268
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:20,862
"This is a delicious evening,
when the whole body's one sense..."

269
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:25,158
What if I screamed?
What if I just screamed right now?

270
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:28,495
"When a woman decides to sleep
with a man..."

271
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:30,580
"I had three chairs in my house..."

272
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:33,708
"You knew there would always
be a spring...

273
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:38,421
...as you knew the river would flow again
after it was frozen.

274
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:42,425
When the cold rains kept on
and killed the spring...

275
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:48,098
...it was as though a young person
had died for no reason."

276
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:26,052
All right, they have rescheduled
the operation for Monday.

277
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:27,595
What happened yesterday?

278
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,431
They had a golf tournament.

279
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,224
Who knows with these people?

280
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:32,767
Good morning, Mr. Messinger.

281
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:36,104
The "G" is soft, like "messenger."

282
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:39,149
What is on your lip?

283
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:41,985
What? Am I slobbering here?

284
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,784
- Where did you get that?
- What am I, a prisoner?

285
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:52,996
You wanna get well
or you want Ben & Jerry's?

286
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,539
This operation is a big deal.

287
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,500
Continue to eat in this manner...

288
00:22:57,668 --> 00:23:00,045
...you might as well skip it.
Save the 30 grand.

289
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:04,466
If you'd have performed the operation
yesterday like you were supposed to...

290
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:08,011
...I'd be sucking carrots through
a straw in my arm. What happened?

291
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:11,389
Circumstances were not optimal
for the procedure.

292
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:15,810
Hey, I ain't "the procedure." My name is
Nathan Messinger and I'm right here.

293
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:25,528
Miss, can you tell me
where the bathroom is?

294
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,156
Okay, to the left? Yeah, okay.

295
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:43,064
Hello, hello, hello...

296
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:48,570
Floating, floating. Don't pop it.
Don't pop it!

297
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,865
Do you know the Muffin Man

298
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:54,200
The Muffin Man, the Muffin Man?

299
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:39,537
Maggie.

300
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:42,498
- Hi, Anne.
- What are you doing here?

301
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:44,792
I was on my way up to X-Ray...

302
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,754
...and I thought I'd stop in and just...

303
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:49,505
...hide.

304
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,466
From what?

305
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,261
I should've gone into pediatrics.

306
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:56,888
Oh, no.

307
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:59,724
Every guy you meet
is either married or a gyno.

308
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:03,770
Never date a man who knows more
about your vagina than you do.

309
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:08,149
Poor little guy.

310
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,736
Yeah, okay.

311
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:13,821
He never stops crying.

312
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,824
- What's wrong with him?
- No insurance.

313
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,828
Found him in a dumpster
behind the House of Pies.

314
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,289
We worked him up the wazoo
for everything...

315
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:26,292
...from drug exposure to diabetes.
We got nothing.

316
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:28,628
May I?

317
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:31,714
Yeah.

318
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:42,934
Did you do an ultrasound?

319
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,852
- You hear a murmur?
- Worth a shot.

320
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,062
Yeah.

321
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:49,274
Okay, baby. Yes.

322
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:54,028
So, what are you hiding from?

323
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:57,865
My patient's wife.

324
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,869
She wants me to tell her
that her husband is gonna be okay...

325
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:04,831
...that I have every confidence...

326
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:06,874
...and I don't.

327
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:10,253
And after all this time,
and after all this work...

328
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,839
...I suddenly have this feeling that...

329
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:17,427
...none of this is in my hands.
Nothing.

330
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:22,181
And if it isn't...
If it isn't, what do I do with that?

331
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:22,283
Excuse me.

332
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:31,501
Are you a visitor?

333
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,253
Yes.

334
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:38,007
Well, visiting hours have been over
since 8:00.

335
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,593
Why do they have that?

336
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:43,805
- What?
- Hours.

337
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:47,016
Doesn't it help the patient
to be visited?

338
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,270
Who are you visiting? Mr. Messinger?

339
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:53,064
Right now?

340
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:54,899
Yeah.

341
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,403
You.

342
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:03,574
I don't need a visitor.

343
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:04,992
You're not ill?

344
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:06,244
No.

345
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:10,248
I'm one of the doctors here.

346
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,627
Are you in despair?

347
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:21,509
I lost a patient.

348
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:23,886
You did everything you could?

349
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:27,890
I was holding his heart in my hand
when he died.

350
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:30,810
Then he wasn't alone.

351
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,395
Yes, he was.

352
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33,813
People die.

353
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,022
Not on my table.

354
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:37,859
People die when their bodies give out.

355
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:41,612
It's my job to keep their bodies from
giving out. Or what am I doing here?

356
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:43,739
It wasn't your fault, Maggie.

357
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:45,575
I wanted him to live.

358
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,910
He is living.

359
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:49,829
Just not the way you think.

360
00:29:57,838 --> 00:29:59,505
I don't believe in that.

361
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,925
Some things are true
whether you believe in them or not.

362
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,179
How did you know my name?

363
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:11,726
What's yours?

364
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:18,900
Seth.

365
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:25,698
You better get out of here, Seth...

366
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:28,951
...or Security's gonna think
you're a psych patient.

367
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,359
- Where are we?
- Down a liter.

368
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:45,403
Suction.

369
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:49,031
I am stuck on Band-Aid brand

370
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:51,284
'Cause Band-Aid's stuck on me

371
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:56,372
I am stuck on Band-Aid brand
'Cause Band-Aid's stuck on me

372
00:31:57,207 --> 00:32:01,752
No dying now, Mr. Messinger.
Not until you give me Seth's phone number.

373
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,881
I am stuck on Band-Aid brand

374
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,925
'Cause Band-Aid's stuck on me

375
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:38,039
Those eyes.

376
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,041
The way he looked...

377
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:42,752
...right down into me.

378
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,505
Seth.

379
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:50,343
What kind of name is "Seth"?

380
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,463
Hey.

381
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,632
I thought you'd be here.

382
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,010
Salty.

383
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:58,929
My transplant tanked at 2 a.m.

384
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,390
You okay?

385
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:02,600
Yeah.

386
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:10,566
You might wanna return this.

387
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:18,574
That part about the spring?
"You knew there'd always be a spring."

388
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:20,576
How did you know that?

389
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:23,662
What are you talking about?
I didn't give you this book.

390
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,083
You didn't?

391
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:29,919
Where'd you get it?

392
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:45,017
Hi. I'm a physician and I think
a patient left that in my office.

393
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:48,270
- Can you tell me who checked it out?
- I can't tell you who.

394
00:35:48,522 --> 00:35:50,481
I can tell you when.

395
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:54,235
- Okay.
- All right, give me 5 minutes.

396
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:27,685
Hello, Maggie.

397
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:31,355
It's nice to see you again.

398
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:33,524
It's weird to see you again.

399
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,569
Weird is nice.

400
00:36:39,573 --> 00:36:41,198
You like Hemingway?

401
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:44,326
Yeah. Yeah, I'm starting to.

402
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,458
- May I?
- Yeah.

403
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:56,589
"As I ate the oysters with their
strong taste of the sea...

404
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:58,924
...and their faint metallic taste...

405
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,802
...as I drank their cold liquid
from each shell...

406
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:05,097
...and washed it down
with the crisp taste of the wine...

407
00:37:05,307 --> 00:37:07,266
...I lost the empty feeling...

408
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,435
...and began to be happy."

409
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:12,771
He never forgets to describe
how things taste.

410
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:16,108
I like that.

411
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:20,237
Do you come here a lot?

412
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:22,197
I live here.

413
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,242
What do you do?

414
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:26,535
Read.

415
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:29,038
No, I mean, ha, ha, your work.

416
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,749
I'm a messenger.

417
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:36,003
What kind of messenger?
A bike messenger?

418
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:38,881
No, I'm a messenger of God.

419
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:42,217
Got a message for me?

420
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:44,803
I already gave it to you.

421
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:49,099
Did you use my pager? I usually don't
get my messages unless you beep me.

422
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:53,479
You've definitely been beeped.

423
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:57,900
- How is Messinger?
- He's good.

424
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,027
The operation went really well.

425
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,780
- It was a good day.
- It was.

426
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:05,324
Yeah, I didn't kill anybody today.

427
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:09,411
- You're an excellent doctor.
- How do you know?

428
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:10,704
I have a feeling.

429
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:13,248
That's pretty flimsy evidence.

430
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:15,250
Close your eyes.

431
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:19,630
It's just for a moment.

432
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,944
What am I doing?

433
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,906
You're touching me.

434
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,492
Touch.

435
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:51,620
How do you know?

436
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:54,373
Because I feel it.

437
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:05,342
You should trust that.

438
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,761
You don't trust it enough.

439
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:22,568
- Let's go somewhere.
- Where?

440
00:39:22,736 --> 00:39:23,736
I don't care.

441
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,196
What do you want to do?

442
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,532
Anything.

443
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:15,662
What's that like?

444
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:20,417
What's it taste like?

445
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:22,252
Describe it. Like Hemingway.

446
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:26,965
Well, it tastes like, um...

447
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:28,884
...a pear.

448
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:32,179
You don't know what a pear tastes like?

449
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,973
I don't know what a pear
tastes like to you.

450
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:42,815
Sweet...

451
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:44,775
...juicy.

452
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:48,946
Soft on your tongue.
Grainy...

453
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:52,407
...like sugary sand
that dissolves in your mouth.

454
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,704
How's that?

455
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,459
It's perfect.

456
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:21,270
The first time I looked in a microscope...

457
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:24,064
...that's when I knew I wanted to be a doctor.

458
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:29,111
Okay, let me have your hand.

459
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:30,988
What for?

460
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:32,948
We'll take a look at your blood.

461
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:35,742
Not a possibility.

462
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:40,289
Oh. Ha, ha. Men.

463
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,875
I suppose you know a woman's
threshold of pain...

464
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:45,335
...is nine times higher than a man's.

465
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:55,637
Okay, take a...

466
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:58,140
Take a look at that.

467
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:03,395
That's bright.

468
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:10,360
That's me.

469
00:42:11,154 --> 00:42:12,154
All those cells.

470
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:15,365
That's all you are.

471
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:19,912
That and all the space in between.

472
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:23,248
If this is all you are...

473
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:25,250
...these cells...

474
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:28,420
...then when they die, that's the end.

475
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:31,965
I don't know. I think so.

476
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,469
How do you explain it?

477
00:42:35,637 --> 00:42:37,054
What?

478
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:40,390
The enduring myth of heaven.

479
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,856
I used to think that I had it
all figured out.

480
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,233
But you didn't?

481
00:42:49,651 --> 00:42:54,238
No.

482
00:42:56,157 --> 00:43:00,118
Because something happened.
Something happened in my OR and I got...

483
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:04,122
...this jolt. I got this feeling
that there's something...

484
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:08,126
...bigger out there. Something bigger
than me, bigger than you, and it...

485
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:12,047
Does that sound crazy?

486
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:13,507
No.

487
00:43:14,676 --> 00:43:17,386
Because I couldn't fix him.
I did everything right...

488
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:19,888
...and I couldn't fix him.

489
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,849
That's not supposed to happen.

490
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:26,478
And I...

491
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:28,605
And you cried.

492
00:43:31,693 --> 00:43:33,110
Yeah.

493
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:37,990
- Why do people cry?
- What do you mean?

494
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:41,201
I mean, what happens physically?

495
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:44,830
Well, um...

496
00:43:44,998 --> 00:43:48,583
Tear ducts operate on a normal basis
to lubricate and protect the eye.

497
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:52,129
When you have an emotion,
they overact and create tears.

498
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:55,090
Why? Why do they overact?

499
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:58,552
I don't know.

500
00:43:59,429 --> 00:44:00,846
Maybe...

501
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:03,307
Maybe emotion becomes so intense...

502
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:05,434
...your body just can't contain it.

503
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:09,354
Your mind and your feelings
become too powerful.

504
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:11,481
Your body weeps.

505
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:18,655
I have to go.

506
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:21,325
I gotta go. Stay right here.

507
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,076
Don't go anywhere.

508
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:25,370
Stay right there.

509
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,351
- Get the tube out.
- He can't breathe.

510
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:49,436
It's because the tube is blocked.

511
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:03,367
How you feeling?

512
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,369
Ready to hit the waves.

513
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:08,538
Well, I'm afraid your bodysurfing days are over.

514
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:13,377
You got a mean tattoo going there.

515
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:15,796
What does your wife think of that?

516
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,756
That is my wife.

517
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:25,430
Okay.

518
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:29,601
Check his vitals every 15.

519
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:49,204
I can't see you,
but I know you're there.

520
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:58,088
Go back and tell them
that I'm not going.

521
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,842
Not yet.

522
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:31,705
Where have you been?

523
00:46:32,415 --> 00:46:34,791
Oh, shit. I totally forgot dinner.

524
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:36,293
Dinner?

525
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:39,588
- With who?
- Well, he's a...

526
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:41,673
Uh...

527
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:44,718
A guy I met. I bumped into him
and we got something to eat.

528
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:47,053
Did you pack my backpack?

529
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:48,763
What else?

530
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:51,641
Well, we talked...

531
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,810
...and then I got beeped
and he disappeared.

532
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:55,353
Why did you pack my backpack?

533
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:57,481
Earl, what are you doing?

534
00:46:57,732 --> 00:47:00,484
I thought we'd fly up to Tahoe,
use your uncle's cabin...

535
00:47:00,693 --> 00:47:01,985
...maybe do a little hiking.

536
00:47:03,613 --> 00:47:04,696
What?

537
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:09,534
God. Is it?

538
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:10,994
Maggie, it's just a tick.

539
00:47:11,454 --> 00:47:14,331
- Get a match.
- We're not going to burn him, Jordan.

540
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:16,541
It'll have to back out.
Can't leave the head in.

541
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:19,836
- We can't just be burning tick heads.
- Then get some alcohol.

542
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:21,087
I don't have any.

543
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:23,590
- You don't have any alcohol?
- I don't operate here.

544
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:25,467
Well, how about some olive oil?

545
00:47:25,635 --> 00:47:27,802
Okay. All right.

546
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:29,679
Which kind? JalapeÃ±o or rosemary?

547
00:47:30,473 --> 00:47:31,890
Rosemary.

548
00:47:33,142 --> 00:47:36,895
So, what did you and your friend...?
What did you say his name was?

549
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:39,564
Seth.

550
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:42,400
What did you two talk about?

551
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:44,694
Dying.

552
00:47:47,073 --> 00:47:50,867
Come on, we deal with life and death
every day. Why can't we talk about it?

553
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:54,871
I hope you're not gonna become
one of those surgeons who prays in the OR.

554
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,172
Can we talk for a minute?

555
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:05,674
We'll talk while camping.

556
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:08,301
No, Jordan, I can't go camping now.

557
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:10,262
We need to spend some time together.

558
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:14,015
Okay. All right, let's see if we can
just spend five minutes.

559
00:48:14,267 --> 00:48:17,477
Let's see if we can just stand still
for five minutes and be together.

560
00:48:18,354 --> 00:48:19,354
Doing what?

561
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,856
Just being here.

562
00:48:22,942 --> 00:48:25,026
- I'll get the trail map.
- No. No, no.

563
00:48:25,194 --> 00:48:26,319
No, I mean it.

564
00:48:26,779 --> 00:48:28,154
Nothing but us.

565
00:48:31,534 --> 00:48:32,826
What am I supposed to do?

566
00:48:34,287 --> 00:48:35,704
Just look at me.

567
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:52,512
You can't do it.

568
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:55,390
- You flinched. You lose!
- You cheat.

569
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:12,991
That old black magic called

570
00:49:13,242 --> 00:49:15,076
Love

571
00:49:15,578 --> 00:49:17,203
Thank you very much.

572
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:21,207
Welcome back. We've been talking
to mothers who are members of the KKK.

573
00:49:23,419 --> 00:49:25,086
You want to watch anything?

574
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,175
Me neither.

575
00:49:38,643 --> 00:49:40,560
How do you know when I'm here?

576
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:47,567
I know.

577
00:49:49,779 --> 00:49:51,404
Jeez, you look good.

578
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:56,284
I forgot how good everybody looked.

579
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:00,622
Thirty years of silence.

580
00:50:00,873 --> 00:50:04,626
You got guts, kid, showing yourself like that.
I appreciate that. I do.

581
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:06,294
It's gonna make it easier.

582
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:09,923
I gotta tell you, I feel fine.

583
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:14,135
You might want to check your orders
because I sure don't feel like I'm dying.

584
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:15,637
You're not dying.

585
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:19,265
Oh, right. Then how come you're
hanging around my room all the time?

586
00:50:19,517 --> 00:50:22,018
I'm the only one with his ass
hanging out of his dress.

587
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:24,813
Unless...

588
00:50:28,317 --> 00:50:29,984
Could it be...

589
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,362
...the doctor?

590
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:35,281
Sure.

591
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:37,075
The doctor.

592
00:50:37,827 --> 00:50:39,661
Oh, she's pretty.

593
00:50:39,912 --> 00:50:41,496
A little flat-chested...

594
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:43,581
...but all you need's a handful.

595
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:45,959
- Who are you?
- This is good.

596
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:48,461
This is what they call...

597
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:50,880
..."serendipitous."

598
00:50:51,132 --> 00:50:54,592
Look that up in the dictionary,
you'll see a picture of you and me.

599
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:57,762
Thank you. Thank you, okay?

600
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:01,933
Okay.

601
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,769
You ready to deal?

602
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:08,106
Because I can answer
all your questions, friend.

603
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,701
How's the French toast this evening?

604
00:51:19,869 --> 00:51:20,869
Fabulous.

605
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:22,245
Well, set me up.

606
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:32,881
Guess I should introduce myself.

607
00:51:33,549 --> 00:51:35,049
Come on, give me your hand.

608
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:39,220
Put it in mine. There you go.

609
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:41,431
A little tighter. Tighter.
There you go.

610
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:43,224
No, that's too much.

611
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:45,643
There you go. Good grip.

612
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:48,104
Nathaniel Messinger.

613
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:50,148
Glutton, hedonist...

614
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:54,736
...former celestial body,
recent addition to the human race.

615
00:51:58,616 --> 00:52:00,283
I don't believe you.

616
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:01,826
You want proof?

617
00:52:02,328 --> 00:52:04,162
You hang out at a library.

618
00:52:04,413 --> 00:52:06,206
You can speak every language.

619
00:52:06,415 --> 00:52:08,374
You travel with the speed of thought.

620
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:10,627
And you're reading
my mind right now.

621
00:52:11,045 --> 00:52:12,045
Stop that.

622
00:52:12,338 --> 00:52:13,463
You're doing it.

623
00:52:15,216 --> 00:52:16,382
It's impossible.

624
00:52:16,801 --> 00:52:19,844
"Some things are true
whether you believe them or not."

625
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:24,098
How?

626
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:25,558
- You choose.
- Choose?

627
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:27,435
To fall to Earth.

628
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:30,647
You take the plunge,
the tumble, the dive.

629
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:32,941
You jump off a bridge.
Leap out a window.

630
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:36,110
You just make up your mind to do it
and you do it.

631
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:42,367
You wake up all smelly
and aching from head to toe...

632
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:44,410
...and hungrier than you've
ever been...

633
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:48,122
...only you have no idea what hunger is
or any of that stuff...

634
00:52:48,374 --> 00:52:52,377
...so it's all real confusing and painful,
but very, very good.

635
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:56,756
Human.

636
00:52:58,259 --> 00:52:59,509
Listen, kid:

637
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:04,055
He gave these bozos
the greatest gift in the universe.

638
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:06,558
You think he didn't give it to us too?

639
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:07,767
Which gift?

640
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:09,978
Free will, brother.

641
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:12,814
Free will.

642
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:41,926
Couldn't get a job.

643
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,345
No past, no training.

644
00:53:44,597 --> 00:53:46,097
No ID.

645
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:50,268
Then one day,
I was walking past a building site.

646
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:51,936
A skyscraper.

647
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:54,814
And I thought, "I could do that."

648
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,983
You see, these people down here...

649
00:53:57,234 --> 00:54:00,278
...a lot of them are afraid of heights,
you know what I'm saying?

650
00:54:00,529 --> 00:54:03,740
That makes me uniquely qualified.

651
00:54:04,325 --> 00:54:08,077
And besides, it feels like
a little bit of home up here.

652
00:54:08,329 --> 00:54:09,704
And I like what I do.

653
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:11,122
I'm good at it.

654
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,877
These things'll kill you.

655
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:19,005
Are there others?

656
00:54:19,715 --> 00:54:21,299
Others like you?

657
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,176
Yeah, they're out there.

658
00:54:23,636 --> 00:54:27,555
You see them, but most of the time
you just walk on by.

659
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:31,768
Nobody likes to think of the old life.
You know, what they gave up.

660
00:54:32,353 --> 00:54:34,020
Then why'd you do it?

661
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:45,031
My daughter, Ruth...

662
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:47,158
...her stupid husband, Frank...

663
00:54:47,743 --> 00:54:49,202
...and my grandkids.

664
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:51,955
Petie's 4, Hannah's 6.

665
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:58,503
And this is my wife, Teresa.

666
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:02,548
Did you...

667
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:05,176
...tell her who you were?

668
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:08,763
I started to try once or twice.

669
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:11,099
Then I thought, "Why do that to her?"

670
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:12,642
Do what?

671
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:15,019
It's too much for them.

672
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:18,731
People don't believe in us anymore.

673
00:55:28,242 --> 00:55:30,535
Do they still gather together
at sunrise?

674
00:55:31,078 --> 00:55:32,996
And sunset, yes.

675
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:36,249
Take me there?

676
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:49,137
Can you hear it?

677
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:00,690
No.

678
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,294
I can't hear that!

679
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,921
But you can't feel this!

680
00:56:24,423 --> 00:56:25,757
Nathan!

681
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:34,223
You have to go back.

682
00:56:34,475 --> 00:56:36,601
Not until I catch the big wave.

683
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:43,900
Wait.

684
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:45,610
Wait for what?

685
00:56:46,779 --> 00:56:47,904
Swim!

686
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:25,691
And then you just...

687
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:27,276
...fall.

688
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:29,403
- Fall?
- Dive.

689
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:32,490
You make up your mind to do it...

690
00:57:33,492 --> 00:57:34,951
...and you do it.

691
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:37,787
And when you wake up, you're?

692
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:39,831
Yes.

693
00:57:42,126 --> 00:57:44,001
To smell the air.

694
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:45,962
Taste water.

695
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:47,421
Read a newspaper.

696
00:57:47,631 --> 00:57:50,049
- To lie.
- Through your teeth.

697
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:51,717
To feed the dog.

698
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:55,972
Touch her hair.

699
00:57:58,517 --> 00:58:00,476
What are you waiting for?

700
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:08,317
There is so much beauty up here.

701
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:11,529
Yes.

702
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:37,638
Here you are again.

703
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:41,100
We're releasing your friend tomorrow.

704
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:42,518
That's good.

705
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:46,147
His family's having
a kind of a welcome-home party.

706
00:58:46,607 --> 00:58:48,024
Are you?

707
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:52,737
Will you be going?

708
00:58:55,574 --> 00:58:56,574
This is Earl.

709
00:58:56,742 --> 00:58:58,117
He told me.

710
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:00,494
What else does he tell you?

711
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:04,665
He worries that you never sleep.
And he loves to see you smile.

712
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:08,461
Sometimes I think Earl's
the only one who understands me.

713
00:59:08,712 --> 00:59:09,921
What about your boyfriend?

714
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,714
Do you love him?

715
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:16,052
Love? I don't know.

716
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:17,637
What does that mean?

717
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:20,640
I was hoping you could tell me.

718
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,726
Well, it's a word...

719
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:26,646
...that describes a chemical react...

720
00:59:28,232 --> 00:59:30,900
It's just crap. I'm full of crap.

721
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:36,197
I wait all day, just hoping
for one more minute with you...

722
00:59:36,448 --> 00:59:38,115
...and I don't even know you.

723
00:59:38,617 --> 00:59:40,368
What do you want to know?

724
00:59:42,371 --> 00:59:44,330
Why you wear the same
clothes all the time?

725
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:46,540
Why won't you give me
your phone number?

726
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:48,793
Are you married?

727
00:59:49,503 --> 00:59:50,544
No.

728
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:52,421
Are you homeless?

729
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:55,174
No.

730
00:59:56,218 --> 00:59:57,385
Are you a drummer?

731
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:04,308
Why don't you ever touch me?

732
01:00:08,272 --> 01:00:10,398
I don't want to hurt you.

733
01:00:12,484 --> 01:00:14,402
You won't hurt me.

734
01:00:39,011 --> 01:00:40,386
Did you feel that?

735
01:00:53,859 --> 01:00:56,193
If I could make you understand...

736
01:00:59,406 --> 01:01:00,906
I understand.

737
01:01:05,704 --> 01:01:07,204
I'll see you around.

738
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:13,687
Hey, doc!

739
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:19,693
No, give me the whole package.
Come here.

740
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,404
- Hi.
- Thanks for coming.

741
01:02:21,655 --> 01:02:22,988
You look great.

742
01:02:24,825 --> 01:02:25,825
Is this heaven?

743
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:27,743
Look at this.

744
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:33,791
Come on, let's meet some people.

745
01:02:34,209 --> 01:02:35,668
You got an appetite?

746
01:02:40,257 --> 01:02:41,674
Have a beer, Seth.

747
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:43,509
Where you from?

748
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:45,761
Up.

749
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:48,597
- North. Uh, ahem, Canada.
- Oh, yeah?

750
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:56,856
Listen. Can you hear?

751
01:02:57,816 --> 01:02:59,275
I'm growing.

752
01:02:59,985 --> 01:03:00,985
Smile, Hannah.

753
01:03:04,239 --> 01:03:06,490
Oh, how cute.

754
01:03:10,662 --> 01:03:12,037
How long have you known Seth?

755
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,332
Not very long.

756
01:03:16,835 --> 01:03:19,128
But I feel like I've known him forever.

757
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:22,214
Honey, that hurts.

758
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:26,051
You're just like Grandpa.

759
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:29,305
Come on.

760
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:31,557
Let's see if the cookies are done.

761
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:32,850
Come on, Seth.

762
01:03:33,101 --> 01:03:35,311
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, great.

763
01:03:40,692 --> 01:03:41,984
How did you two meet?

764
01:03:43,695 --> 01:03:46,489
He works with me over at the site.
Construction work.

765
01:03:47,449 --> 01:03:48,782
I thought he was a messenger.

766
01:03:49,868 --> 01:03:51,911
Yeah, he's one of those...

767
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:53,162
..."hyphenates."

768
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:55,748
I'll be right back.

769
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:14,391
Seth, Seth.

770
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:16,727
Hey.

771
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:37,289
Here, can you cut this up?

772
01:04:44,589 --> 01:04:47,049
So in what province is it in Canada
were you born?

773
01:04:48,093 --> 01:04:49,885
I wasn't born in Canada.

774
01:04:54,516 --> 01:04:55,849
What are your parents' names?

775
01:05:04,359 --> 01:05:06,026
No parents.

776
01:05:13,076 --> 01:05:15,953
You have very delicate hands
for a construction worker.

777
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:17,705
I'm not a construction worker.

778
01:05:17,998 --> 01:05:20,207
Very pale hands. Let me see.

779
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:26,547
- Why did you do that?
- Let me see your hand.

780
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:27,756
No.

781
01:05:29,843 --> 01:05:30,843
What's your last name?

782
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:32,261
You know my last name.

783
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:33,721
No, I don't.

784
01:05:36,016 --> 01:05:37,057
Plate.

785
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:38,934
Seth Plate?

786
01:05:45,692 --> 01:05:51,071
I cut you.

787
01:05:52,824 --> 01:05:56,785
I cut you with that knife.
I felt it go in. You felt it.

788
01:05:57,787 --> 01:05:59,121
Not the way you do.

789
01:06:00,707 --> 01:06:02,249
The way I do?
What does that mean?

790
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:06,128
You mean the way a doctor does?
The way a woman does? What?

791
01:06:06,338 --> 01:06:07,755
The way...

792
01:06:09,049 --> 01:06:10,049
...a human does.

793
01:06:12,552 --> 01:06:13,969
I have no sense of touch.

794
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:16,221
You feel that?

795
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:18,182
You don't have to be frightened.

796
01:06:18,350 --> 01:06:19,725
You freak!

797
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:21,143
You liar!

798
01:06:21,728 --> 01:06:23,604
Who... What are you?

799
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:25,397
I came to take Mr. Balford...

800
01:06:26,775 --> 01:06:28,692
...and I saw you.

801
01:06:30,362 --> 01:06:32,613
I couldn't take my eyes off you.

802
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:35,282
How you fought for him.

803
01:06:37,369 --> 01:06:39,286
And you looked right at me...

804
01:06:39,913 --> 01:06:41,622
...like I was a man.

805
01:06:42,207 --> 01:06:45,084
- "To take Mr. Balford"?
- I was there.

806
01:06:45,377 --> 01:06:49,296
- We're always there in every room.
- What are you talking about?

807
01:06:49,798 --> 01:06:51,757
I was there in the stairwell...

808
01:06:52,217 --> 01:06:54,426
...when you cried for your patient.

809
01:06:54,594 --> 01:06:57,596
And I touched you. Remember?

810
01:06:59,099 --> 01:07:00,641
Why are you doing this?

811
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:04,353
Because I'm in love with you.

812
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:13,904
I don't believe you.

813
01:07:14,322 --> 01:07:15,906
Do you feel that?

814
01:07:18,618 --> 01:07:20,077
You don't want to believe me.

815
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:22,705
I cannot conceive of it!

816
01:07:24,124 --> 01:07:26,125
- Maggie.
- Just get out!

817
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:29,378
Get out!

818
01:08:18,887 --> 01:08:20,429
Doctor?

819
01:08:22,974 --> 01:08:24,767
Doctor?

820
01:09:11,105 --> 01:09:12,523
Hello?

821
01:09:19,197 --> 01:09:20,614
Seth?

822
01:09:23,952 --> 01:09:25,577
Are you here?

823
01:10:22,093 --> 01:10:24,094
I wanna see you.

824
01:10:26,514 --> 01:10:28,640
Let me see you.

825
01:10:57,921 --> 01:10:59,755
Just stay.

826
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:04,635
Just stay until I fall asleep.

827
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:43,882
Oh, yes!

828
01:11:46,386 --> 01:11:48,136
Thank you.

829
01:12:07,407 --> 01:12:09,116
- Maggie.
- Hey.

830
01:12:09,283 --> 01:12:11,201
- The baby can't sleep.
- What?

831
01:12:11,911 --> 01:12:13,745
Has anyone ever seen the baby sleep?

832
01:12:13,913 --> 01:12:16,707
I don't know. Let's check him out.

833
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:22,004
- Okay.
- Hey.

834
01:12:25,883 --> 01:12:27,050
Choanal atresia.

835
01:12:27,301 --> 01:12:29,761
There's hardly any air getting through.

836
01:12:30,388 --> 01:12:31,388
How did you know?

837
01:12:33,391 --> 01:12:35,225
I just...

838
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:38,186
...knew!

839
01:13:03,588 --> 01:13:05,130
Maggie?

840
01:13:05,298 --> 01:13:06,423
Yeah.

841
01:13:06,591 --> 01:13:08,216
Are you alone?

842
01:13:08,593 --> 01:13:10,010
Yeah.

843
01:13:13,681 --> 01:13:16,308
Pretty intuitive call on the baby.

844
01:13:16,476 --> 01:13:18,018
Think so?

845
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:21,021
I couldn't have done it better.

846
01:13:21,731 --> 01:13:24,024
Well, that's a compliment.

847
01:13:38,289 --> 01:13:39,831
What are you doing?

848
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:41,625
I'm spending time with you.

849
01:13:44,504 --> 01:13:46,797
Will you marry me?

850
01:13:46,964 --> 01:13:48,882
We can finally get up to Tahoe.

851
01:13:49,092 --> 01:13:50,634
Get married on the Nevada side...

852
01:13:50,968 --> 01:13:53,136
...honeymoon and be back
before we miss a case.

853
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:58,266
What do you want me to do?
Get down on my knees?

854
01:13:58,434 --> 01:13:59,726
What do you want me to say?

855
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:02,771
We belong together.

856
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:04,606
We're the same species.

857
01:14:06,317 --> 01:14:08,235
- Jordan...
- I'm not...

858
01:14:11,197 --> 01:14:15,117
I'm not very good at matters
of the heart. I mean...

859
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:17,702
...the proverbial heart.

860
01:14:20,331 --> 01:14:21,873
Please be my wife.

861
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,584
Just...

862
01:14:26,379 --> 01:14:27,587
Just think about it.

863
01:14:43,521 --> 01:14:45,147
Breathe in.

864
01:14:48,401 --> 01:14:50,193
Breathe in.

865
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,791
I'm good.

866
01:15:12,049 --> 01:15:17,095
I don't understand a God who would let
us meet, if we could never be together.

867
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:21,433
He didn't tell you.

868
01:15:25,646 --> 01:15:26,646
Tell me what?

869
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:28,565
Maybe you should ask him.

870
01:15:29,317 --> 01:15:31,484
No, I'm asking you.

871
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:44,456
Seth knows no fear...

872
01:15:44,624 --> 01:15:45,999
...no pain...

873
01:15:46,167 --> 01:15:47,709
...no hunger.

874
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:51,755
He hears music in the sunrise.

875
01:15:53,591 --> 01:15:55,508
But he'd give it all up.

876
01:15:55,676 --> 01:15:57,177
He loves you that much.

877
01:15:59,931 --> 01:16:01,932
I don't understand.

878
01:16:04,727 --> 01:16:06,728
He can fall.

879
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:09,689
He can give up his existence
as he knows it.

880
01:16:09,857 --> 01:16:13,026
He can give up eternity and become...

881
01:16:13,194 --> 01:16:14,361
...one of us.

882
01:16:15,196 --> 01:16:17,322
It's up to you.

883
01:16:18,491 --> 01:16:20,450
How do you know this?

884
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:28,041
Because I did it.

885
01:16:48,604 --> 01:17:00,907
Seth?

886
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:07,580
Seth, I need to talk to you.

887
01:17:11,502 --> 01:17:13,628
Seth, please.

888
01:17:16,507 --> 01:17:18,425
Please be here.

889
01:17:19,927 --> 01:17:22,262
Oh, God, help me through this.

890
01:17:33,232 --> 01:17:35,650
You are so beautiful.

891
01:17:37,611 --> 01:17:39,988
You'll always be that way.

892
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:44,826
Jordan asked me to go away with him...

893
01:17:45,036 --> 01:17:47,037
...and get married.

894
01:17:49,332 --> 01:17:51,291
He knows me.

895
01:17:52,126 --> 01:17:54,169
He knows the demands of my work.

896
01:17:54,712 --> 01:17:56,796
You don't love him.

897
01:17:57,673 --> 01:17:59,424
He and I are the same.

898
01:18:01,886 --> 01:18:03,887
And I want that.

899
01:18:07,058 --> 01:18:10,894
And I want somebody who can
feel my hand when I touch him.

900
01:18:12,646 --> 01:18:14,272
But you can feel me.

901
01:18:14,565 --> 01:18:16,274
You felt me.

902
01:18:17,985 --> 01:18:20,195
I want to say goodbye.

903
01:18:21,989 --> 01:18:23,948
I don't want to see you again.

904
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:09,382
Yoo-hoo!

905
01:22:25,149 --> 01:22:27,358
Hey. Hey, buddy.

906
01:22:27,651 --> 01:22:29,110
You can't be in here.

907
01:22:29,987 --> 01:22:34,741
Do you see me?

908
01:22:34,908 --> 01:22:36,326
Can you see me?

909
01:22:36,535 --> 01:22:37,744
Oh, yeah. We can see you.

910
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:39,537
Your invisible drug wore off.

911
01:22:39,705 --> 01:22:41,247
Is this blood?

912
01:22:41,415 --> 01:22:42,415
This is blood!

913
01:22:42,708 --> 01:22:43,833
Is it red?

914
01:22:44,418 --> 01:22:45,627
Red?

915
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:47,545
Is it red?

916
01:22:48,422 --> 01:22:49,964
Color.

917
01:22:50,174 --> 01:22:52,550
What color were the drugs you took?

918
01:22:53,594 --> 01:22:55,136
Better get your butt out of here.

919
01:22:55,846 --> 01:22:56,971
You got somewhere to go?

920
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:08,191
Maggie.

921
01:23:14,365 --> 01:23:17,200
Down and down and down I go

922
01:23:17,493 --> 01:23:19,702
Round and round and round I go

923
01:23:20,454 --> 01:23:22,080
Round and spin

924
01:23:22,373 --> 01:23:24,499
Loving the spin I'm in

925
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:27,335
Loving that old black magic

926
01:23:27,628 --> 01:23:29,587
Called love

927
01:23:31,090 --> 01:23:32,965
Love!

928
01:23:34,301 --> 01:23:35,468
Hi!

929
01:23:38,764 --> 01:23:40,181
Hello.

930
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:48,231
I was wondering if you could tell me
how to get to the county hospital?

931
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:34,068
Can I help you, sir?

932
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:37,113
I'll just take a moment
to catch my breath.

933
01:24:38,157 --> 01:24:39,699
Breath!

934
01:24:42,494 --> 01:24:43,536
Maggie Rice.

935
01:24:45,289 --> 01:24:46,497
Are you a patient?

936
01:24:46,874 --> 01:24:48,541
No. I just need to find her, please.

937
01:24:48,876 --> 01:24:51,586
You'll have to call her office.
Someone there can help you.

938
01:24:51,879 --> 01:24:53,087
Do you know where she is?

939
01:24:53,881 --> 01:24:55,840
No, sir, I do not know where she is.

940
01:24:59,178 --> 01:25:00,803
You have this computer...

941
01:25:02,055 --> 01:25:04,348
...and all this technology.
Can't you look her up?

942
01:25:05,225 --> 01:25:06,267
Anne!

943
01:25:08,103 --> 01:25:09,604
Where's Maggie?

944
01:25:14,693 --> 01:25:16,986
So you're a friend of Maggie's?

945
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:19,781
What happened to you?

946
01:25:20,115 --> 01:25:21,115
Sorry.

947
01:25:21,533 --> 01:25:22,658
It's okay.

948
01:25:25,788 --> 01:25:26,996
I fell.

949
01:25:27,498 --> 01:25:30,166
Evidently. Off a train?

950
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:32,710
I fell in love.

951
01:25:36,757 --> 01:25:38,466
Anne?

952
01:25:40,093 --> 01:25:41,677
Please help me find her.

953
01:25:46,892 --> 01:25:50,269
She went to Lake Tahoe. Her uncle
has a cabin on the Nevada side.

954
01:25:50,479 --> 01:25:51,562
Wait!

955
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:24,846
Cassiel.

956
01:26:25,347 --> 01:26:27,056
Are you there?

957
01:26:35,566 --> 01:26:36,816
Hello.

958
01:27:31,705 --> 01:27:33,456
Where you headed?

959
01:27:34,666 --> 01:27:35,666
Tahoe!

960
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,169
Reno!

961
01:27:38,503 --> 01:27:39,587
Tahoe!

962
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:41,631
I'm going to Reno.

963
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,382
I'm going to Tahoe.

964
01:27:43,926 --> 01:27:46,302
Hop in. We'll figure it out
when we get there.

965
01:29:04,673 --> 01:29:06,132
Earl?

966
01:30:03,607 --> 01:30:05,649
Am I too late?

967
01:30:06,902 --> 01:30:07,902
Too late?

968
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:09,945
Jordan?

969
01:30:14,367 --> 01:30:16,827
I couldn't marry Jordan.

970
01:30:19,456 --> 01:30:21,665
I'm in love with you.

971
01:30:29,299 --> 01:30:31,133
What happened?

972
01:30:34,096 --> 01:30:35,930
Free will.

973
01:30:50,654 --> 01:30:52,655
I feel you.

974
01:32:11,234 --> 01:32:12,902
Do you feel that?

975
01:32:13,069 --> 01:32:14,570
Yes.

976
01:32:16,156 --> 01:32:17,907
And that?

977
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:24,914
How's it feel?
Tell me what it feels like.

978
01:32:25,373 --> 01:32:27,082
I can't.

979
01:32:28,752 --> 01:32:30,211
Try.

980
01:32:31,588 --> 01:32:33,130
Warm.

981
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:40,095
Aching.

982
01:32:57,656 --> 01:32:59,323
It's okay.

983
01:33:01,743 --> 01:33:03,035
We fit together.

984
01:33:03,203 --> 01:33:04,828
I know.

985
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:07,623
We were made to fit together.

986
01:33:28,687 --> 01:33:31,689
I always asked the dying
what they liked best about living.

987
01:33:34,401 --> 01:33:36,485
Wrote it down in my book.

988
01:33:38,697 --> 01:33:40,281
This is it.

989
01:33:41,491 --> 01:33:43,617
This is what I like best.

990
01:33:44,202 --> 01:33:46,704
You haven't even started yet.

991
01:33:47,122 --> 01:33:49,707
We have our whole lives together.

992
01:33:49,874 --> 01:33:51,166
You and me.

993
01:33:51,334 --> 01:33:53,585
Mr. And Mrs. Plate.

994
01:35:31,393 --> 01:35:33,102
Hey.

995
01:39:26,210 --> 01:39:27,628
Maggie.

996
01:39:28,588 --> 01:39:29,671
Seth.

997
01:39:29,839 --> 01:39:31,798
- I'll get help.
- You're here.

998
01:39:32,508 --> 01:39:34,009
- Stay.
- I should get help.

999
01:39:34,260 --> 01:39:36,303
Don't go. The driver went.

1000
01:39:36,512 --> 01:39:37,846
Please stay.

1001
01:39:38,181 --> 01:39:40,682
Please stay with me.

1002
01:39:40,850 --> 01:39:42,309
I'm scared.

1003
01:39:47,023 --> 01:39:49,524
- I screwed up.
- No.

1004
01:39:49,942 --> 01:39:51,818
I wanted to show you everything.

1005
01:39:52,278 --> 01:39:53,487
You will.

1006
01:39:57,158 --> 01:40:00,661
You came all this way.

1007
01:40:01,245 --> 01:40:03,038
I'm sorry.

1008
01:40:03,831 --> 01:40:05,791
Oh, God, no, Maggie.

1009
01:40:06,876 --> 01:40:08,293
To touch you...

1010
01:40:08,461 --> 01:40:09,628
...and to feel you.

1011
01:40:10,588 --> 01:40:13,840
To be able to hold your hand right now.

1012
01:40:14,008 --> 01:40:15,217
You know what that means?

1013
01:40:15,426 --> 01:40:18,679
Do you know how much I love you?

1014
01:40:22,642 --> 01:40:24,976
Keep looking at me, okay?

1015
01:40:26,354 --> 01:40:28,105
Look right in my eyes.

1016
01:40:30,066 --> 01:40:32,901
- Someone's out there.
- Maggie.

1017
01:40:33,778 --> 01:40:37,280
Don't look at them.
Please, Maggie, no, don't you look at them.

1018
01:40:37,448 --> 01:40:39,825
Is this what happens?

1019
01:40:46,124 --> 01:40:47,457
Yes.

1020
01:40:53,631 --> 01:40:56,133
This is what happens.

1021
01:40:59,804 --> 01:41:01,847
I'm not afraid.

1022
01:41:05,685 --> 01:41:07,811
When they ask me...

1023
01:41:09,522 --> 01:41:11,356
...what I liked the best...

1024
01:41:13,151 --> 01:41:14,484
...I'll tell them...

1025
01:41:14,652 --> 01:41:16,653
...it was you.

1026
01:41:46,267 --> 01:41:47,934
God!

1027
01:43:50,933 --> 01:43:53,894
I can't see you,
but I know you're there.

1028
01:43:55,980 --> 01:43:57,898
I'm sorry.

1029
01:44:00,943 --> 01:44:02,485
Get out.

1030
01:44:03,070 --> 01:44:04,613
Seth.

1031
01:44:04,780 --> 01:44:07,407
Was it you? Were you the one?
Were you there?

1032
01:44:07,950 --> 01:44:09,367
No.

1033
01:44:10,119 --> 01:44:11,369
Why did he do this?

1034
01:44:11,579 --> 01:44:12,662
I don't know.

1035
01:44:12,872 --> 01:44:14,080
Because her number was up?

1036
01:44:15,249 --> 01:44:17,000
What do you want me to say?

1037
01:44:24,634 --> 01:44:28,136
- Am I being punished?
- You know better than that.

1038
01:44:29,472 --> 01:44:31,181
That's life.

1039
01:44:32,892 --> 01:44:34,684
You're living now.

1040
01:44:35,978 --> 01:44:37,479
And one day...

1041
01:44:37,647 --> 01:44:39,272
...you'll be dying.

1042
01:44:45,780 --> 01:44:46,821
What's it like?

1043
01:44:48,157 --> 01:44:49,366
What?

1044
01:44:50,201 --> 01:44:51,201
Warmth.

1045
01:44:53,496 --> 01:44:55,330
It's wonderful.

1046
01:44:56,999 --> 01:44:59,709
If you'd known this
was going to happen...

1047
01:45:00,878 --> 01:45:02,212
...would you have done it?

1048
01:45:08,302 --> 01:45:10,845
I would rather have had...

1049
01:45:11,847 --> 01:45:14,391
...one breath of her hair...

1050
01:45:16,227 --> 01:45:19,854
...one kiss of her mouth...

1051
01:45:22,566 --> 01:45:25,026
...one touch of her hand...

1052
01:45:26,696 --> 01:45:29,406
...than an eternity without it.

1053
01:45:31,867 --> 01:45:33,410
One.

1054
01:45:34,305 --> 01:46:34,859
