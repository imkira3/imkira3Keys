2
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:31,864
Read the charges.

3
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:34,491
Dr. Jumba Jookiba,

4
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:37,870
lead scientist of
Galaxy Defense Industries,

5
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:40,372
you stand before this council

6
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:45,461
accused of illegal
genetic experimentation.

7
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,510
How do you plead?

8
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,054
Not guilty!

9
00:00:55,096 --> 00:01:00,684
My experiments are only theoretical,
completely within legal boundaries.

10
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:05,064
We believe you actually
created something.

11
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,399
Created something?

12
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:11,195
But that would be
irresponsible and unethical.

13
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,405
I would never, ever,

14
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,742
make more than one.

15
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,668
What is that monstrosity?

16
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,462
Monstrosity?

17
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:33,467
What you see before you is
the first of a new species.

18
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:37,471
I call it Experiment 626.

19
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,350
He is bulletproof, fireproof

20
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:44,103
and can think faster
than supercomputer.

21
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:49,233
He can see in the dark
and move objects 3,000 times his size.

22
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:54,279
His only instinct,
to destroy everything he touches!

23
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,033
So it is a monster.

24
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,368
Hey, just a little one.

25
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,663
It is an affront to nature.
It must be destroyed!

26
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:07,459
Calm yourself, Captain Gantu.
Perhaps it can be reasoned with.

27
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:13,799
Experiment 626, give us some sign
you understand any of this.

28
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:18,470
Show us that there is something
inside you that is good.

29
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,648
So naughty!

30
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,819
I didn't teach it that.

31
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:36,655
Place that idiot scientist under arrest!

32
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:41,535
I prefer to be called "evil genius"!

33
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:44,163
And as for that abomination,

34
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:48,000
it is the flawed product
of a deranged mind.

35
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,210
It has no place among us.

36
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:53,463
Captain Gantu, take him away.

37
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,382
With pleasure.

38
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,863
Uncomfortable?

39
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,199
Good!

40
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:24,453
The council has banished you
to exile on a desert asteroid.

41
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:27,623
So relax, enjoy the trip,

42
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,042
and don't get any ideas.

43
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:33,503
These guns are locked
onto your genetic signature.

44
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:36,381
They won't shoot anyone but you.

45
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,800
Why, you...

46
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,554
May I remind the Captain
that he is on duty?

47
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,724
Secure the cell!

48
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,309
Aye, Captain.

49
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,481
Captain on deck.

50
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,651
All ahead full.

51
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:02,866
Does this look infected to you?

52
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,980
Quiet, you.

53
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,902
- Gunfire in the cell bay!
- Open a channel.

54
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,747
He's loose on Deck C!

55
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,040
Red alert. Seal off the deck!

56
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,426
Security, converge on Door 7!

57
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:07,097
Deadly force authorized. Fire on sight!
Fire on sight!

58
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,598
There he is!

59
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,313
Security to Bridge.

60
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:16,648
It's in the ventilation system.

61
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,487
He's headed for the power grid.

62
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,326
What was that?

63
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,828
I don't think he's on the ship anymore.

64
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:32,205
Confirmed. He's taken a police cruiser.

65
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,543
Yeah, he took the red one.

66
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,360
That's it! We've got it. We've got it!

67
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,532
Hyperdrive activated.
System charging.

68
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,659
He's engaged his H-drive!

69
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,037
Warning, guidance is not functional.

70
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:15,040
Pursuit Commander, that crazy trog
is about to make a jump!

71
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,626
Break formation! Get clear of that ship!

72
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,671
Navigation failure. Do not engage...

73
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,392
Get me Galactic Control.

74
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,561
Where is he?

75
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,063
He's still in hyperspace.

76
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,398
Where will he exit?

77
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,732
Calculating now.

78
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:44,903
Quadrant 17, section 005, area 51.

79
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,572
A planet called Ee-arth.

80
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:50,534
I want an expert on this planet
in here now!

81
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,412
What is that?

82
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,330
Water. Most of the planet is
covered in it.

83
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:59,251
He won't survive in water.
His molecular density is too great.

84
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,173
No.

85
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,721
Of course.

86
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,266
How much time do we have?

87
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:17,936
We have projected his landing
at three hours, 42 minutes.

88
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,688
We have to gas the planet.

89
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,983
Hold it! Hold everything!

90
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,777
Earth is a protected wildlife reserve.

91
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,989
Yeah. We've been using it
to rebuild the mosquito population,

92
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:32,367
which, need I remind you,
is an endangered species!

93
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,245
Am I to assume you are the expert?

94
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,622
I don't know about "expert."

95
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,710
Agent Pleakley at your service.

96
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,545
Can we not simply destroy the island?

97
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,338
No! Crazy head!

98
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:48,633
The mosquito's food of choice,
primitive humanoid life forms,

99
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:51,303
have colonies all over that planet.

100
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,637
Are they intelligent?

101
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,140
No, but they're very delicate.

102
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,267
In fact, every time an asteroid strikes
their planet,

103
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,145
they have to begin life all over.

104
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,898
It's fascinating, isn't it?
With this, I've been able to study...

105
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,984
What if our military forces
just landed there?

106
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,694
Well, that'd be a bad idea!

107
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:10,906
These are extremely
simple creatures, miss.

108
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,992
Landing there would create
mass mayhem and planet-wide panic!

109
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:17,037
A quiet capture would require
an understanding of 626

110
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,622
that we do not possess.

111
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:23,084
Who, then, Mr. Pleakley,
would you send for his extraction?

112
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,546
Does he have a brother?

113
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:28,882
Close grandmother, perhaps?

114
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,763
Friendly cousin?

115
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,723
Neighbor with a beard?

116
00:08:58,663 --> 00:08:59,871
He got away?

117
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,374
I'm sure this comes
as no surprise to you.

118
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,877
I designed this creature
for to be unstoppable.

119
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,672
Which is precisely why
you must now bring him back.

120
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,048
What, me?

121
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,050
And to reward you,

122
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:16,888
we are willing to trade
your freedom for his capture.

123
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:22,227
626 will not come easily.

124
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:26,481
Maybe direct hit from plasma cannon
might stun him long enough to...

125
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:30,277
Plasma cannon granted.
Do we have a bargain, Dr. Jumba?

126
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:35,991
But it's a delicate planet!
Who's going to control him?

127
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,951
You will.

128
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:41,454
Very good, Your Highness.
I didn't quite...

129
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,581
You're not joking!

130
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:46,793
So, tell me, my little one-eyed one,

131
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:51,548
on what poor, pitiful,
defenseless planet

132
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:57,095
has my monstrosity been unleashed?

133
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,412
Stop. Stop.

134
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:30,957
Lilo, why are you all wet?

135
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,751
It's sandwich day.

136
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:39,257
Every Thursday, I take Pudge the fish
a peanut-butter sandwich.

137
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,759
Pudge is a fish?

138
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,428
And today
we were out of peanut butter.

139
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:47,891
So I asked my sister what to give him,
and she said a tuna sandwich.

140
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,268
I can't give Pudge tuna!

141
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:53,354
Do you know what tuna is?

142
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,857
- Fish?
- It's fish!

143
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:59,944
If I gave Pudge tuna,
I'd be an abomination!

144
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,113
I'm late because I had to go to the store

145
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:06,242
and get peanut butter,
'cause all we have is stinking tuna!

146
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,496
Lilo, Lilo, why is this so important?

147
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,664
Pudge controls the weather.

148
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,585
You're crazy.

149
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,256
Please! Please!

150
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,301
Everybody calm down!

151
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,469
Girls.

152
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,682
- Lilo...
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

153
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,226
I won't do it again!

154
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,478
Maybe we should call your sister.

155
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,981
No! I'll be good! I want to dance.

156
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,067
I practiced.

157
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,444
I just want to dance.

158
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,196
I practiced.

159
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,491
She bit me.

160
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,501
I called your sister.

161
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:59,420
She said to wait for her
here on the porch.

162
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:02,507
We'll try again on Sunday.

163
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,432
Does this look infected to you?

164
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,600
Yeah.

165
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,229
You better not have rabies.

166
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:19,858
If you have rabies,
the dogcatcher is going to have to cut...

167
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,652
Are you going to play dolls?

168
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,196
You don't have a doll.

169
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,198
This is Scrump.

170
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,868
I made her, but her head is too big.

171
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:33,371
So I pretend a bug laid eggs
in her ears, and she's upset,

172
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:36,332
because she only has
a few more days to...

173
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,228
Lilo!

174
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:04,444
Lilo?

175
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,322
Oh, no.

176
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,743
You better be home.

177
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,290
Hey! Watch where you're going!

178
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,334
Stupid head!

179
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,844
Lilo!

180
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,430
Lilo! Open the door, Lilo!

181
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:33,723
Go away.

182
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,645
Lilo? We don't have time for this.

183
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,689
Leave me alone to die.

184
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:45,693
Come on, Lilo, that social worker's
going to be here any minute!

185
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:08,174
You are so finished when I get in there!

186
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:17,850
I'm going to stuff you in the blender,
push "purée," then bake you into a pie

187
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,143
and feed it to the social worker!

188
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:23,731
And when he says, "This is great.
What's your secret?" I'm going to say,

189
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:27,402
"Love and nurturing."

190
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,153
Hi.

191
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,865
You must be the...

192
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,283
The stupid head.

193
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,080
You know, I'm really sorry about that,

194
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:42,834
and if I'd known who you were,
of course I never would've...

195
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:43,960
I can pay for that.

196
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,503
It's a rental.

197
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,338
Are you the guardian in question?

198
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,841
Yes. I'm Nani.

199
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:52,343
Nice to meet you, Mister...

200
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,469
Bubbles.

201
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,680
Mr. Bubbles. That's a strange...

202
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:56,931
Yes, I know.

203
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,559
Are you going to invite me in, Nani?

204
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:03,312
I thought we could sit out here and talk.

205
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,356
I don't think so.

206
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,566
Right.

207
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,486
This way.

208
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:22,540
Wait here.

209
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,590
Hey!

210
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,303
So, lemonade?

211
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:38,347
Do you often leave
your sister home alone?

212
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,682
No. Never.

213
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,603
Well, except for just now.

214
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:47,231
I had to run to the store to get some...

215
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,445
You left the stove on
while you were out?

216
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,530
Low heat! Just a simmer.

217
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,992
It's coming along great.

218
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,786
I found that this morning.

219
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,996
Lilo! There you are.

220
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:06,667
Honey face, this is Mr. Bubbles.

221
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,419
Nice to meet you.

222
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,588
Your knuckles say "Cobra."

223
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,885
Cobra Bubbles.

224
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:19,180
You don't look like a social worker.

225
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,432
I'm a special classification.

226
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,935
Did you ever kill anyone?

227
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,605
We're getting off the subject.

228
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,441
Let's talk about you. Are you happy?

229
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:36,280
I'm adjusted. I eat four food groups

230
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,866
and look both ways
before crossing the street

231
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:42,787
and take long naps and get disciplined.

232
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,955
Disciplined?

233
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:48,417
Yeah. She disciplines me real good.
Sometimes five times a day.

234
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,002
- No.
- With bricks.

235
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,629
Bricks?

236
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,755
In a pillowcase.

237
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,550
Okay! That's enough sugar for you.

238
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,928
Why don't you run along,
you little cutie?

239
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,973
The other social workers
just thought she was a scream.

240
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,307
Thirsty?

241
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,979
Let me illuminate to you
the precarious situation

242
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,356
in which you have found yourself.

243
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:16,320
I am the one they call
when things go wrong,

244
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:20,199
and things have indeed gone wrong.

245
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,011
My friends need to be punished.

246
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:47,143
Call me next time
you're left here alone.

247
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,394
Yep.

248
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,690
In case you're wondering,
this did not go well.

249
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,861
You have three days
to change my mind.

250
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,706
Lilo!

251
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,819
Why didn't you wait at the school?

252
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,738
You were supposed to wait there!

253
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,198
Lilo!

254
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,618
Do you not understand?
Do you want to be taken away?

255
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,703
Answer me!

256
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,830
- No!
- No, you don't understand?

257
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,916
- No!
- No, what?

258
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,751
No!

259
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,928
You're such a pain!

260
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:07,139
So why don't you sell me
and buy a rabbit instead?

261
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,892
At least a rabbit would behave
better than you!

262
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:14,021
Go ahead! Then you'll be happy,
because it'll be smarter than me, too!

263
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,940
And quieter!

264
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:19,568
You'll like it, 'cause it's stinky, like you!

265
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,946
Go to your room!

266
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,282
I'm already in my room!

267
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:40,881
Hey.

268
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,553
I brought you some pizza,
in case you were hungry.

269
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,140
We're a broken family, aren't we?

270
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:51,642
No.

271
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:55,062
Maybe a little.

272
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,191
Maybe a lot.

273
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,319
I shouldn't have yelled at you.

274
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:04,155
We're sisters. It's our job.

275
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,157
Yeah, well, from now on...

276
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,993
I like you better as a sister than a mom.

277
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,662
Yeah?

278
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:16,125
And you like me better as a sister
than a rabbit, right?

279
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,630
Yes.

280
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,591
Yes, I do.

281
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,678
I hit Mertle Edmonds today.

282
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,013
You hit her?

283
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,681
Before I bit her.

284
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,684
You bit her. Lilo, you shouldn't...

285
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,728
People treat me different.

286
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,899
They just don't know what to say.

287
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:41,067
I'll tell you what.

288
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:43,819
If you promise not to fight anymore,

289
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:48,657
I promise not to yell at you,
except on special occasions.

290
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,911
Tuesdays and bank holidays
would be good.

291
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:53,996
Yeah? Would that be good?

292
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,041
My camera's full again.

293
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,919
Aren't they beautiful?

294
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,390
A falling star!

295
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:21,023
I call it! Get out! Get out!
I have to make a wish!

296
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,983
Can't you go any faster?

297
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,569
Oh, no! Gravity is increasing on me.

298
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:26,987
No, it's not!

299
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,949
It is, too, Lilo.
The same thing happened yesterday.

300
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:33,786
You rotten sister!
Your butt is crushing me!

301
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,871
Why do you act so weird?

302
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,669
It's me again.

303
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:47,925
I need someone to be my friend,
someone who won't run away.

304
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:53,389
Maybe send me an angel,
the nicest angel you have.

305
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,147
What we when hit?

306
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,569
There it is.
It stayed jammed under the fender.

307
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,740
We better call somebody.

308
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,676
We're looking for something
that can defend itself,

309
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:16,305
something that won't die,
something sturdy, you know?

310
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,556
Like a lobster.

311
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:20,392
Lilo, you lolo.
Do we have a lobster door?

312
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:23,145
No. We have a dog door.
We are getting a dog.

313
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:32,446
So nice to see your pretty face again!

314
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,572
Jumba?

315
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:37,076
We need your name and address
at the bottom of the form...

316
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,288
The kennel's back this way.

317
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,123
Go. Pick someone out.

318
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:51,131
Hello?

319
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:55,469
Are there any "aminals" in here?

320
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,144
Hello!

321
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:19,243
Hi.

322
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,079
Wow!

323
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:25,916
Yes. All of our dogs are adoptable.

324
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:28,085
Except that one!

325
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,420
What is that thing?

326
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:32,131
A dog, I think,
but it was dead this morning.

327
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,757
It was dead this morning?

328
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,427
Well, we thought it was dead.
It was hit by a truck.

329
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:39,096
I like him! Come here, boy.

330
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,145
Wouldn't you like a different dog?

331
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:48,439
We have better dogs, dear.

332
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:52,192
Not better than him.
He can talk! Say hello.

333
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,613
Dogs can't talk, dear.

334
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:56,739
He did.

335
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:59,199
Does it have to be this dog?

336
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,831
Yes, he's good. I can tell.

337
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,000
You'll have to think of a name for him.

338
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:11,086
His name is Stitch.

339
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,672
Now, that's not a real name

340
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:17,384
in Iceland, but here it's a good name.

341
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,927
Stitch it is.

342
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,554
And there's a $2 license fee.

343
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,306
I want to buy him!

344
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,516
Can I borrow $2?

345
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,982
He's all yours.

346
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,652
You're all mine.

347
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:35,903
Well, what's he doing?

348
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:39,198
Keep quiet. He's listening for us.

349
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,704
How good is his hearing?
I mean, can he...

350
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,879
Why don't you run?

351
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:57,966
Coming! I'm coming!

352
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,259
Stop!

353
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:03,097
I have just determined this situation
to be far too hazardous!

354
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,682
Don't worry, I won't hit her.

355
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:08,936
No! That girl is a part
of the mosquito food chain.

356
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,188
Here! Educate yourself.

357
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:16,652
Using a little girl for a shield.
This is low even for you!

358
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,074
Tear him apart
with all both my bare hands!

359
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:23,909
Have you lost your mind?

360
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,703
What is it, Stitch?

361
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,996
We cannot be seen!

362
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:31,041
Bad dog, barking at nothing!

363
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:36,380
You can't shoot, and you can't be seen.

364
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:40,759
Look at you! You look like a monster.
We have to blend in.

365
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,846
Okay, I got to get to work.

366
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:46,515
Stick around town
and stay out of the roads, okay?

367
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,392
I'll meet you at 1:00.

368
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:59,903
Okay, I guess we should be going.

369
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,906
What about Stitch?

370
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,165
My friends!

371
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,045
What do you want?

372
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:22,050
I'm sorry I bit you and pulled your hair
and punched you in the face.

373
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:24,219
Apology not accepted.

374
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:27,181
Now get out of my way
before I run you over.

375
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,559
I got a new dog. His name is Stitch.

376
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:34,772
That is the ugliest thing
I have ever saw.

377
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,440
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

378
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:40,360
Get it away from me!
I'm gonna get a disease!

379
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,116
Somebody do something!

380
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,910
Oh, great! He's loose.

381
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,537
His destructive programming
is taking effect.

382
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,457
He will be irresistibly drawn
to large cities

383
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:55,083
where he will back up sewers,

384
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,920
reverse street signs
and steal everyone's left shoe.

385
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:20,150
It's nice to live on an island
with no large cities.

386
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,489
Are you okay?

387
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,149
Hey, over here, little buddy.

388
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:40,731
When you're ready to give up,
just let us know.

389
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:48,113
Yeah!

390
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:21,939
This is you.

391
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,651
This is your badness level.

392
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:29,154
It's unusually high
for someone your size.

393
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,697
We have to fix that.

394
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:32,574
Lilo!

395
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,618
Your dog cannot sit at the table.

396
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:37,704
Stitch is troubled. He needs desserts.

397
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,873
You didn't even eat your sweet potato.

398
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,416
I thought you liked them.

399
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:42,793
Desserts!

400
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,007
David!

401
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,801
I got a new dog.

402
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,595
You sure it's a dog?

403
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:57,391
He used to be a collie
before he got ran over.

404
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,521
Hey.

405
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,489
How's it, Nani?

406
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,617
Did you catch fire again?

407
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,494
Nah, just the stage.

408
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:21,373
Listen, I was wondering
if you're not doing anything this...

409
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:24,543
David, I told you, I can't. I...

410
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,005
I got a lot to deal with right now.

411
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:30,424
I know. I just figured
you might need some time...

412
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,634
You smell like a lawn mower.

413
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,595
Look, I got to go.

414
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,848
The kid at Table 3's
throwing poi again.

415
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,058
Maybe some other time, okay?

416
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,144
Don't worry.

417
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:44,521
She likes your butt and fancy hair.

418
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:46,940
I know. I read her diary.

419
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,859
She thinks it's fancy?

420
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,209
Look what I find! Get restraints!

421
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,962
- Right.
- Take that! Hurry!

422
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,339
Hold still just a...

423
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:28,648
Hey, Nani!

424
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,069
Is that your dog?

425
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,071
All is well.

426
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,448
Please, go about your business.
I'm okay.

427
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:39,076
Your head looks swollen.

428
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:41,244
Actually, she's just ugly.

429
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:44,664
Darling. He's joking.

430
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,875
Ugly, look at me.

431
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,002
This is not working out.

432
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,378
But...

433
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:52,923
Yeah?

434
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:57,677
Well, who wants to work
at this stupid fakey luau anyway?

435
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,638
Come on, Lilo.

436
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:07,938
Did you lose your job
because of Stitch and me?

437
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:10,607
Nah. The manager's a vampire,

438
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:14,236
and he wanted me to join
his legion of the undead.

439
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,779
I knew it.

440
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,200
This is a great home. You'll like it a lot.

441
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:22,994
See?

442
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,454
Lilo...

443
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:25,789
Comfy.

444
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,250
- Hey!
- Hey!

445
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,626
What is the matter with you?

446
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:32,462
Be careful of the little angel!

447
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:35,215
It's not an angel, Lilo.
I don't even think it's a dog.

448
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,550
We just have to take him back.

449
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,219
He's just cranky
because it's his bedtime.

450
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,595
He's creepy, Lilo.

451
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:43,557
I won't sleep
knowing he's loose in the house.

452
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:47,310
You're loose in the house all the time,
and I sleep just fine!

453
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:49,146
Hey, what are you doing?

454
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:50,814
Stop that, Stitch!

455
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,107
Hey!

456
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:55,610
Look at him, Lilo.

457
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:58,029
He's obviously mutated
from something else.

458
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,948
We have to take him back.

459
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,617
He was an orphan,
and we adopted him!

460
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,327
What about 'ohana?

461
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,204
He hasn't been here that long.

462
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:09,958
Neither have I.
Dad said 'ohana means "family."

463
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:16,298
'Ohana means "family."

464
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,426
- "Family" means...
- Nobody gets left behind.

465
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,928
- Or?
- Or forgotten.

466
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:26,349
I know. I know. I hate it
when you use 'ohana against me.

467
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:33,773
Don't worry,
you can sleep right next to me.

468
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,907
Look how curious the puppy is.

469
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:45,202
This is my room, and this is your bed.

470
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:48,788
This is your dolly and bottle.

471
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,999
See? Doesn't spill.

472
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,293
I filled it with coffee.

473
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,879
Good puppy. Now get into bed.

474
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,674
Hey! That's mine!

475
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,887
Down!

476
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:11,394
Be careful of that! You don't touch this!
Don't ever touch it!

477
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:21,613
No! Don't pull on her head!
She's recovering from surgery.

478
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,660
No! That's from my blue period.

479
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,459
There.

480
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:37,254
You know, you wreck
everything you touch.

481
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:40,257
Why not try and make something
for a change?

482
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,775
Wow. San Francisco.

483
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:11,162
Save me!

484
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,711
No more caffeine for you.

485
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:23,008
This little girl is wasting her time.

486
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:26,886
626 cannot be taught to ignore
its destructive programming.

487
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,350
Push that over.

488
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:36,313
- What are you doing?
- Nothing!

489
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:39,274
- Say, I want to try it on.
- No!

490
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,525
- Share!
- Hey!

491
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:43,653
You're just jealous 'cause I'm pretty!

492
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,113
Don't move.

493
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,866
A mosquito has chosen me
as her perch.

494
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,243
She's so beautiful.

495
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,954
Look, another one.

496
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:56,916
And another one!
Why, it's a whole flock.

497
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,168
And they like me!

498
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,879
They're nuzzling my flesh
with their noses.

499
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:03,173
Now, they're, they're...

500
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,889
I think it might be a koala, an evil koala.

501
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:12,682
I can't even pet it.

502
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:15,560
It keeps staring at me,
like it's going to eat me.

503
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:20,398
Hello?

504
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:22,859
Nani?

505
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,029
Hello?

506
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,531
Are you there?

507
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,372
- Now, this is interesting.
- What?

508
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:38,249
626 was designed to be a monster,

509
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:41,127
but now he has nothing to destroy.

510
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:46,383
You see, I never gave him
a greater purpose.

511
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:50,428
What must it be like to have nothing,

512
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:54,849
not even memories to visit
in the middle of the night?

513
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:05,902
Nah!

514
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,968
That's the Ugly Duckling.

515
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:32,679
See? He's sad because he's all alone

516
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,389
and nobody wants him.

517
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:37,434
But on this page,
his family hears him crying

518
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:39,018
and they find him.

519
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,187
Then the Ugly Duckling is happy,

520
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,690
because he knows where he belongs.

521
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,285
Want to listen to the King?

522
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:58,705
You look like an Elvis fan.

523
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:04,210
Nani.

524
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,795
Nani!

525
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,089
Yeah?

526
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,299
Look.

527
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:34,824
Heard you lost your job.

528
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:39,412
Well, actually, I just quit that job,

529
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,956
because, you know,
the hours are just not conducive

530
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,791
to the challenges of raising a child...

531
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,001
Hey!

532
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,878
I am so sorry about that.

533
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:48,755
What is that thing?

534
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,465
That's my puppy.

535
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,674
Really?

536
00:41:55,513 --> 00:42:00,266
Thus far, you have been adrift
in the sheltered harbor of my patience,

537
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:03,228
but I cannot ignore you being jobless.

538
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:05,939
Do I make myself clear?

539
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,565
Perfectly.

540
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:12,403
And next time I see this dog, I expect it
to be a model citizen, capisce?

541
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,198
Yes?

542
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:16,533
New job.

543
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,660
Model citizen.

544
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,663
Good day.

545
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:28,545
Mrs. Hasagawa?

546
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:30,630
I'm here to answer your newspaper ad.

547
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:33,049
Elvis Presley was a model citizen.

548
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:36,386
I've compiled a list of his traits
for you to practice.

549
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:39,055
Number one is dancing.

550
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:40,682
I can't talk now, dear.

551
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:43,017
I'm waiting for someone
to answer my ad.

552
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,561
That's why I'm here.

553
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,062
Hands on your hips.

554
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,855
Now follow my lead.

555
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:55,822
That's my want ad.

556
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,156
I know!

557
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,667
Why is everything so dark?

558
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,919
I am all about coffee.

559
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:12,297
Let's move on to step two.

560
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:15,383
Elvis played guitar. Here.

561
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:18,678
Hold it like this,
and put your fingers here.

562
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:21,931
See? Now you try.

563
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,561
And I make great cappuccinos
and lattes with...

564
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,022
I wish I could, Nani,
but I just hired Teddy,

565
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,357
and with tourist season ending...

566
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:46,289
Concierge-er-ing is my life.

567
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:48,041
I just love to answer phones...

568
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,918
This is the face of romance.

569
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:54,255
She looks like
she could use some loving.

570
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,886
We might have something.

571
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,638
Good. Now kiss her.

572
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:07,852
I'm sure Elvis had his bad days, too.

573
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:09,896
I'm all about saving people.

574
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,357
Actually, I do think
we have an opening.

575
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,734
- Really?
- Okay, this is it.

576
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,653
Time to bring it all together.

577
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:18,071
That'd be so great!

578
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:20,990
You have no idea
how badly I need this job.

579
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,663
It's all you! Knock them dead!

580
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:50,728
Don't crowd him!

581
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,277
Hey, knock it off!

582
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,192
Hey, Lilo!

583
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:40,570
How's it, Nani?

584
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:43,448
We've been having a bad day.

585
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,206
Hey, I might not be a doctor,

586
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:55,626
but I know that there's no better cure
for a sour face

587
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:59,213
than a couple of boards
and some choice waves.

588
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:00,798
What you think?

589
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:04,093
I think that's a great idea.

590
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:07,907
Yeah!

591
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,465
Can't complain, Mom.

592
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,301
I'm camping out
with a convicted criminal,

593
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:11,220
and I had my head chewed on
by a monster!

594
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:14,223
Wait, something is not right.

595
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:17,476
626 is returning willingly to water.

596
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,854
Hold on, Mom, another call.

597
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:24,483
Mr. Pleakley, you are overdue.
I want a status report.

598
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:26,152
Things are going well.

599
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:27,445
He cannot swim!

600
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:29,447
Things are going well.
Jumba, aren't they going well?

601
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:31,449
Why will he risk drowning?

602
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:34,493
Jumba? Jumba, help me out here.

603
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:38,080
I would have expected you back
by now with 626 in hand.

604
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:42,335
Just a few things left to pack,
and we'll be...

605
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:45,171
Hang up. We are going swimming.

606
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:25,211
Yeah!

607
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:36,472
Lilo!

608
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:39,100
What happened?

609
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:43,062
Some lolo must have
stuffed us in the barrel.

610
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:44,647
Where's Stitch?

611
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,150
Get off of her!

612
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,528
What happened?

613
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:52,571
Stitch dragged her down.

614
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:02,415
We lost Stitch!

615
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:33,362
Lilo? Lilo, look at me.
Look at me, baby. Are you hurt?

616
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:34,613
No.

617
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:41,495
He's unconscious,
but I think he's alive.

618
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:57,136
David, take Lilo.

619
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:03,184
This isn't what it looks like.
We were... It's just that...

620
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:09,398
I know you're trying, Nani,

621
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:13,277
but you need to think about
what's best for Lilo,

622
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:16,489
even if it removes you from the picture.

623
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:23,537
I'll be back tomorrow morning for Lilo.

624
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,248
I'm sorry.

625
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:35,883
Nani? Is there something I can do?

626
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:38,052
No, David.

627
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:42,431
I need to take Lilo home now.

628
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:46,519
We have a lot to talk about, you know.

629
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:47,812
Thanks.

630
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:55,528
You know, I really believed
they had a chance.

631
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:59,365
Then you came along.

632
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:28,185
Lilo, honey,

633
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:32,314
we have to...

634
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:37,987
Don't worry. You're nice,
and someone will give you a job.

635
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:40,823
I would.

636
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:45,494
Come here.

637
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:15,983
One fond embrace

638
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:28,204
Until we meet again

639
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:50,976
That's us before.

640
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:55,439
It was rainy, and they went for a drive.

641
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,318
What happened to yours?

642
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:04,365
I hear you cry at night.
Do you dream about them?

643
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:11,538
I know that's why you wreck things
and push me.

644
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:22,633
Our family's little now,
and we don't have many toys,

645
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:25,761
but if you want,
you could be a part of it.

646
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:30,432
You could be our baby,
and we'd raise you to be good.

647
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:36,981
'Ohana means "family."

648
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:41,610
"Family" means
nobody gets left behind,

649
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:46,573
but if you want to leave, you can.

650
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,623
I'll remember you, though.

651
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:59,586
I remember everyone that leaves.

652
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:31,160
I...

653
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:32,953
Lost.

654
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:42,838
I'm lost.

655
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:50,888
Help!

656
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:53,766
I don't like the ocean!

657
00:55:55,852 --> 00:56:00,439
Look, a friendly little dolphin.
They helped sailors in the war...

658
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:03,650
It's a shark!
It's a shark, and it ain't friendly!

659
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:06,487
It looks like a dolphin.
Tricky fish! Tricky fish!

660
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:09,698
Octopus, come and help me?
The octopus is worse than the shark!

661
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:11,575
I hate this planet!

662
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:23,087
Little monster!

663
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,553
Agent Pleakley here.

664
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,889
I have lost patience with you both.

665
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:37,684
Have you captured 626 or not?

666
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:42,398
Consider yourselves fired
and prison-bound.

667
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:45,734
Your incompetence is
nothing short of unspeakable!

668
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:48,070
But...

669
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,825
We're fired!

670
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:55,661
Now we do it my way!

671
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:56,954
Your way?

672
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:58,789
Wait!

673
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:02,376
It seems I have overestimated
Jumber and Blinkley.

674
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:04,294
Jumba and Pleakley.

675
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:06,964
Whatever. The mission is in jeopardy.

676
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:12,052
This could be your chance
to redeem yourself, Captain Gantu.

677
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:15,097
How soon will you be prepared
to leave?

678
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:17,391
Immediately.

679
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:36,618
Don't run. Don't make me shoot you.
You were expensive.

680
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:41,331
Yes. Yes, that's it. Come quietly.

681
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:44,877
Waiting.

682
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,211
For what?

683
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:50,799
Family.

684
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:55,137
You don't have one.

685
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:57,639
I made you.

686
00:57:58,391 --> 00:58:01,185
Maybe I could.

687
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:03,228
You're built to destroy.

688
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:06,148
You can never belong.

689
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:11,236
Now come quietly,
and we will take you apart.

690
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:14,490
No, no, no, no, don't, don't run!
Don't run!

691
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:30,589
Lilo.

692
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:33,967
I didn't hear you get up.

693
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:37,471
Baby, what's wrong?

694
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:39,348
Stitch left.

695
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:40,974
Really?

696
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:42,809
It's good he's gone.

697
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:45,771
He didn't want to be here, anyway.

698
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:47,940
We don't need him.

699
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:53,111
Lilo,

700
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,698
sometimes you try your hardest,

701
00:58:56,741 --> 00:59:00,369
but things don't work out
the way you want them to.

702
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:05,207
Sometimes things have to change,

703
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:08,585
and maybe sometimes
they're for the better,

704
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:10,587
even if...

705
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:13,382
Nani!

706
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,886
- David!
- I think I found you a job.

707
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:19,054
You what?

708
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:21,723
Old man Kuakini's store,
but we got to hurry.

709
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:26,895
Okay. Lilo?
Baby, this is really important.

710
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,814
I need you to stay here
for a few minutes.

711
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:30,274
I'm going to be right back.

712
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:33,610
Lock the door
and don't answer it for anyone, okay?

713
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:37,030
Things are finally turning around.

714
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:40,242
David, I owe you one.

715
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:41,410
That's okay.

716
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:44,413
You can just date me,
and we'll call it even.

717
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:52,004
Come back here, you little...

718
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:56,758
Stitch?

719
00:59:57,468 --> 00:59:58,760
What is it?

720
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:05,851
Hiding behind your little friend
won't work anymore.

721
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:08,895
Didn't I tell you?
We got fired this morning.

722
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:11,440
New rules.

723
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:21,742
What are we going to do?

724
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:25,120
I love this song!

725
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:26,371
Pliers.

726
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:28,457
- Screwdriver.
- Check.

727
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:32,919
Come out, my friend,
from whomever you're hiding behind.

728
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:36,548
What the...

729
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:42,679
Come on! What's the big deal?

730
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:46,141
I'll put you back together again.

731
01:00:46,225 --> 01:00:49,144
I'll make you taller and not so fluffy!

732
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:51,229
I like fluffy!

733
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:54,149
No. No. No!

734
01:00:56,277 --> 01:00:58,612
Leave my mother out of this!

735
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:02,824
You could do with a makeover.

736
01:01:02,867 --> 01:01:07,829
I tried to give you my good looks,
but let's face it, something went wrong.

737
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:09,247
No!

738
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:15,128
Quick! Follow me! If we make it to...

739
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:18,048
- You're alive!
- They're all over the place!

740
01:01:19,092 --> 01:01:22,678
Running away? Here, let me stop you.

741
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:26,682
You always get in the way!

742
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:28,558
Where's the girl?
What have you done to the girl?

743
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:32,604
Hello? Cobra Bubbles?
Aliens are attacking my house.

744
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:35,065
No, no, no! No aliens!

745
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:40,070
Blue punch buggy!

746
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:43,407
No punch back.

747
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:45,117
They want my dog!

748
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:47,119
There's no need to alert the authorities.

749
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:48,745
Everything's under control.

750
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:49,996
Lilo, who was that?

751
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:52,207
Good, my dog found the chainsaw.

752
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,417
Lilo! Don't hang...

753
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:04,636
You shouldn't play with guns.

754
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:05,721
Okay.

755
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:06,888
Thank you.

756
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:08,932
I just remembered. It's your birthday!

757
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:10,559
Happy birthday!

758
01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:12,352
- Merry Christmas!
- It's not Christmas.

759
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:13,437
Happy Hanukkah!

760
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:14,688
We're leaving Stitch?

761
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,898
Trust me. This is not going to end well.

762
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:18,233
- One potato.
- Two potato.

763
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:19,735
- Three potato.
- Four.

764
01:02:19,777 --> 01:02:21,236
- Five potato.
- Six potato.

765
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,404
Seven potato, more.

766
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:23,530
- My...
- Mother...

767
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:24,614
- Told...
- Me...

768
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:25,741
- You...
- Are...

769
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:27,242
- It.
- I win!

770
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:37,169
Thanks. Mahalo plenty.
You won't be disappointed.

771
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:40,130
I'll show up early to help
with the morning...

772
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:45,260
Don't turn left.

773
01:02:47,805 --> 01:02:49,097
No.

774
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:57,564
One of them had a giant eye
in the middle of his face.

775
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:58,940
Lilo!

776
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:03,695
Please don't do this.

777
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,238
You know I have no choice.

778
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:07,282
No! You're not taking her!

779
01:03:07,366 --> 01:03:08,867
I'm the only one who understands her!

780
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:10,869
You take that away,
she won't stand a chance!

781
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:12,954
You're making this harder
than it needs to be.

782
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:15,957
But you don't know what you're doing!
She needs me!

783
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:18,293
Is this what she needs?

784
01:03:18,377 --> 01:03:23,215
It seems clear to me that you need her
a lot more than she needs you.

785
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:30,430
Lilo! Lilo!

786
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:45,111
Lilo!

787
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:56,456
You ruined everything.

788
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:06,633
You're one of them?

789
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:10,887
Get out of here, Stitch.

790
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:15,183
Surprise!

791
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:20,438
And here I thought
you'd be difficult to catch.

792
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:22,732
Silly me.

793
01:04:23,484 --> 01:04:24,693
Lilo?

794
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:26,528
Lilo!

795
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:42,043
There you go,
all buckled up for the trip.

796
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:47,257
And, look,
I even caught you a little snack.

797
01:04:52,638 --> 01:04:54,097
No! Stop!

798
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:06,651
Lilo.

799
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:11,615
Okay, talk.

800
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:12,908
I know you had something
to do with this.

801
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:14,951
Now where is Lilo?

802
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:17,329
Talk! I know you can.

803
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:21,583
Okay, okay.

804
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,671
Where's Lilo?

805
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:29,633
Lilo...

806
01:05:32,845 --> 01:05:34,804
Now all your washing is up!

807
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:37,015
You're under arrest!
Read him his rights.

808
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:38,725
Listen carefully.

809
01:05:41,395 --> 01:05:45,774
Hello? Galactic Command?
Experiment 626 is in custody.

810
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:47,776
We'll wait right here.

811
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:58,745
Don't interact with her.

812
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:04,960
Where's Lilo?

813
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:06,670
Who? What?

814
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:11,800
Lilo, my sister.

815
01:06:14,553 --> 01:06:19,557
Sorry, we do not know anyone by this...

816
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:21,810
Lilo! She's a little girl, this big!

817
01:06:21,852 --> 01:06:26,189
She has black hair and brown eyes,
and she hangs around with that thing!

818
01:06:29,026 --> 01:06:30,443
We know her.

819
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:32,821
Bring her back.

820
01:06:32,905 --> 01:06:34,864
We can't do that.

821
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:37,325
That would be a misuse
of Galactic resources.

822
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:41,621
See, problem is we're just here for him.

823
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:43,790
So she's gone?

824
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,375
Look at the bright side.

825
01:06:45,459 --> 01:06:48,169
You won't have to yell
at anyone anymore.

826
01:06:56,554 --> 01:06:57,679
Come.

827
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:10,150
'Ohana.

828
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:12,610
Hey! Get away from her.

829
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:15,196
No! What did you say?

830
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:17,866
'Ohana means "family."

831
01:07:18,784 --> 01:07:23,747
- "Family" means nobody...
- Nobody gets left behind.

832
01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:25,832
Or forgotten.

833
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,125
Yeah.

834
01:07:28,961 --> 01:07:30,336
Hey.

835
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:31,838
What?

836
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:36,468
After all you put me through, you
expect me to help you just like that?

837
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:39,054
Just like that?

838
01:07:40,514 --> 01:07:41,598
Fine.

839
01:07:41,682 --> 01:07:44,225
Fine? You're doing what he says?

840
01:07:44,268 --> 01:07:46,102
He's very persuasive.

841
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:49,439
Persuasive?
What exactly are we doing?

842
01:07:49,523 --> 01:07:51,900
- Rescue.
- We're going to get Lilo?

843
01:07:55,654 --> 01:07:58,740
Good! I was hoping to add theft,
endangerment

844
01:07:58,824 --> 01:08:01,743
and insanity to my list of things
I did today.

845
01:08:01,827 --> 01:08:03,078
You, too?

846
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:10,502
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

847
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:13,296
What? Did you think we walked here?

848
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:17,258
This is Gantu,
requesting hyperspace clearance.

849
01:08:17,301 --> 01:08:19,177
Stand by for clearance.

850
01:09:04,056 --> 01:09:06,307
Clearance is granted on vector C-12.

851
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:08,476
Connect me
to the Grand Councilwoman.

852
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:10,562
Gantu, what's going on?

853
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:15,483
I thought you'd like to know
that the little abomination is...

854
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:20,613
Yes, Captain?

855
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:25,368
I'll call you back.

856
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:32,542
How did you get out of there?

857
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:37,797
So what exactly are we doing?

858
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,216
Don't worry, is all part of plan.

859
01:09:40,301 --> 01:09:42,051
We are professionals.

860
01:09:42,136 --> 01:09:44,179
Hey! Get that out of your mouth!

861
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:53,646
Hold on!

862
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:05,575
Okay, is show time!

863
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:21,341
This is it!

864
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:29,390
Go! Go! Go!

865
01:10:40,736 --> 01:10:43,196
Little savage! Get off my ship!

866
01:10:47,993 --> 01:10:49,244
Stitch!

867
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:06,135
Computer, locate Experiment 626.

868
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:08,429
626 located.

869
01:11:08,472 --> 01:11:10,556
We finish this now.

870
01:11:13,727 --> 01:11:15,061
Stitch is unconscious.

871
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:18,731
- What do we do now?
- We stay close. Hope for a miracle.

872
01:11:18,774 --> 01:11:20,066
That's all we can do.

873
01:11:31,453 --> 01:11:32,662
No!

874
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:36,416
Don't leave me, okay?

875
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:47,969
Okay.

876
01:11:55,894 --> 01:11:59,564
Target 626 is in motion. Speed is 84.

877
01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:01,107
Impossible!

878
01:12:26,633 --> 01:12:27,967
Stitch!

879
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:31,763
Abomination.

880
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:33,181
Stupid head.

881
01:12:43,984 --> 01:12:47,362
You're vile! You're foul! You're flawed!

882
01:12:47,446 --> 01:12:49,822
Also cute and fluffy!

883
01:13:03,295 --> 01:13:04,545
You came back.

884
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:06,714
Nobody gets left behind.

885
01:13:15,265 --> 01:13:16,557
Lilo!

886
01:13:22,606 --> 01:13:23,898
Good dog.

887
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:43,126
David!

888
01:13:43,919 --> 01:13:44,961
Hey, Lilo.

889
01:13:45,045 --> 01:13:47,255
Can you give us a ride to shore?

890
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:51,008
Sure,

891
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:53,302
but I have to make two trips.

892
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:58,224
So you're from outer space?
I heard the surfing's choice.

893
01:13:59,184 --> 01:14:01,018
We have 626.

894
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:02,437
Take him to my ship.

895
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:04,647
- Leave him alone.
- Hold on.

896
01:14:04,731 --> 01:14:06,941
Grand Councilwoman, let me explain.

897
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:08,192
Silence!

898
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:11,237
I am retiring you, Captain Gantu.

899
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:15,032
Actually, credit for the capture
goes to...

900
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:16,701
Goes to me.

901
01:14:16,785 --> 01:14:18,911
You'll be lucky if you end up
on a Fluff Trog farm

902
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:21,205
after we sort this thing out.

903
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:23,708
I think I should...

904
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:26,169
You! You're the cause of all this!

905
01:14:26,253 --> 01:14:29,130
If it wasn't for your Experiment 626,
none of this...

906
01:14:29,214 --> 01:14:31,507
- Stitch.
- What?

907
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:33,801
My name Stitch.

908
01:14:33,844 --> 01:14:35,052
Stitch, then.

909
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:37,305
If it wasn't for Stitch...

910
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:42,268
Does Stitch have to go in the ship?

911
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:44,770
Yes.

912
01:14:44,813 --> 01:14:46,814
Can Stitch say goodbye?

913
01:14:48,233 --> 01:14:49,650
Yes.

914
01:14:49,693 --> 01:14:51,110
Thank you.

915
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:58,201
Who are you?

916
01:15:00,078 --> 01:15:02,622
This is my family.

917
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:05,583
I found it all on my own.

918
01:15:06,585 --> 01:15:11,088
It's little and broken, but still good.

919
01:15:12,216 --> 01:15:14,133
Yeah. Still good.

920
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:26,270
Does he really have to go?

921
01:15:27,105 --> 01:15:30,608
You know as well as I
that our laws are absolute.

922
01:15:30,692 --> 01:15:34,403
I cannot change
what the council has decided.

923
01:15:35,072 --> 01:15:38,491
Lilo, didn't you buy that thing
at the shelter?

924
01:15:43,247 --> 01:15:44,413
Hey!

925
01:15:45,916 --> 01:15:48,668
Three days ago,
I bought Stitch at the shelter.

926
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:52,380
I paid $2 for him. See this stamp?
I own him.

927
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:56,217
If you take him, you're stealing.

928
01:15:58,303 --> 01:16:01,430
Aliens are all about rules.

929
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:03,891
You look familiar.

930
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:07,603
CIA. Roswell. 1973.

931
01:16:08,647 --> 01:16:10,856
Yes. You had hair then.

932
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:13,818
Take note of this.

933
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:18,823
This creature has been sentenced
to life in exile,

934
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:23,119
a sentence that shall be
henceforth served out here

935
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:25,955
on Earth.

936
01:16:27,082 --> 01:16:32,920
And as caretaker
of the alien life form, Stitch,

937
01:16:32,963 --> 01:16:35,673
this family is now
under the official protection

938
01:16:35,757 --> 01:16:38,426
of the United Galactic Federation.

939
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:41,971
We'll be checking in now and then.

940
01:16:42,055 --> 01:16:45,266
I was afraid you were going to say that.

941
01:16:45,309 --> 01:16:48,769
This won't be easy to explain
back at headquarters.

942
01:16:48,812 --> 01:16:50,896
I know what you mean.

943
01:16:54,818 --> 01:16:57,320
Don't let those two get on my ship.

944
01:17:07,581 --> 01:17:08,998
CIA?

945
01:17:09,082 --> 01:17:10,166
Former.

946
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:12,126
Saved the planet once.

947
01:17:12,169 --> 01:17:13,461
Convinced an alien race

948
01:17:13,503 --> 01:17:16,589
that mosquitoes were
an endangered species.

949
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:18,299
Now, about your house...

950
01:17:22,012 --> 01:17:23,304
Wait.

951
01:17:24,305 --> 01:18:24,496
