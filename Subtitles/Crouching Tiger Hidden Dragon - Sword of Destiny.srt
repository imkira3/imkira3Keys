1
00:00:-12,000 --> 00:00:-5,-926
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:04,565 --> 00:00:09,486
我所爱的李慕白已经死去18年了
It has been 18 years since the death of my beloved Li Mu Bai.

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,367
那段时间里     侠义之士
In that time,the followers of the Iron Way

4
00:00:15,451 --> 00:00:18,495
变得越来越少
have become few and far between.

5
00:00:22,082 --> 00:00:26,044
武林中人不断争权夺利
Warring clans now vie for power over the Martial World.

6
00:00:29,256 --> 00:00:33,719
我却希望能被武林所遗忘
It is into this world that I hope to slip unnoticed...

7
00:00:36,054 --> 00:00:38,348
就像一个被遗忘的鬼魂一样
like a forgotten ghost

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,307
Name：Personnel are rubbish

9
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,307
据说一位学者的声名
It is said that a scholar's name will last

10
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:23,310
在他死后会持续5年
for five years beyond his passing...

11
00:01:24,812 --> 00:01:28,315
一位剑客的名字会被铭记20年
and a swordsman will be remembered for 20 years.

12
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:34,404
这似乎意味着赞美...
This is meant as praise...

13
00:01:38,075 --> 00:01:40,118
但我相信这是一种祸害
but I believe it to be a curse.

14
00:04:26,785 --> 00:04:29,163
这是谁?
Well, what have we here?

15
00:04:29,246 --> 00:04:32,124
这个女人说她想加入本派
This girl claims she wants to join our ranks.

16
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:35,085
守卫在山门前发现了她
The guards found her at the temple gate.

17
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:48,265
你为何而来？
What brings you here?

18
00:04:48,348 --> 00:04:51,143
我找西莲派的戴阎王
I seek Hades Dai of the West Lotus.

19
00:04:51,227 --> 00:04:54,021
一个可以一统武林的高人
A man great enough to rule the Martial World.

20
00:04:54,104 --> 00:04:57,607
现在你已经看到他了     你有什么要说的？
And now you have found him. What would you ask of me?

21
00:05:35,645 --> 00:05:36,730
让她走
Let her go!

22
00:05:36,813 --> 00:05:39,858
直到值得被我杀死
Let her grow into someone worth killing.

23
00:05:59,502 --> 00:06:01,546
魏方
Wei-Fang.

24
00:06:16,312 --> 00:06:17,395
现身！
Show yourself!

25
00:06:21,775 --> 00:06:22,901
你是谁
Who are you?

26
00:06:22,985 --> 00:06:24,402
问她
Ask her.

27
00:06:24,486 --> 00:06:26,529
魏方
Wei-Fang

28
00:06:39,126 --> 00:06:40,543
你是谁？
Who are you?

29
00:06:40,627 --> 00:06:45,507
带我去见戴阎王     我会给他一个预料之外的惊喜
Bring me to Lord Dai and I will give him a prize greater than the one he sought.

30
00:08:20,018 --> 00:08:21,644
主子     俞师傅已经到了
Master Yu has arrived, sir.

31
00:08:21,728 --> 00:08:23,230
秀莲
Xiu Lien.

32
00:08:24,314 --> 00:08:25,648
你算是悲痛日子里的一点安慰
You brighten a sad day.

33
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:29,819
你以前住的客房我特意留了下来
I've ensured your old quarters were kept for you.

34
00:08:29,903 --> 00:08:31,196
我知道你一定会来
I knew you would come.

35
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,391
你不是唯一知道的人
You were not the only one.

36
00:08:33,491 --> 00:08:35,240
我在路上被袭击了
I was attacked along the way.

37
00:08:35,242 --> 00:08:37,744
先父辞世后       武林中已有数十个剑客被杀
Two dozen swordsmen slain since my father passed.

38
00:08:37,827 --> 00:08:42,958
即便是像你这样的高手    戴阎王也毫无所忌
Hades Dai knows no fear to attack a warrior as great as you.

39
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,251
你于危险之中我也很难过
I'm sorry you were put at risk.

40
00:08:44,334 --> 00:08:48,671
分担贝勒府的悲痛      我也是理所应当
It is my duty to be here,to share your family's loss.

41
00:08:48,755 --> 00:08:50,299
共承悲痛
Our loss.

42
00:08:50,382 --> 00:08:53,302
我父亲总是待你像家人一样
My father always regarded you as family.

43
00:08:56,179 --> 00:08:57,722
它没有被藏起来
It is not kept hidden.

44
00:08:57,806 --> 00:09:01,143
在家父最后的一年里    想把它放到一个看得到的地方
In his last year,my father wanted it where he could see it.

45
00:09:01,226 --> 00:09:04,938
会让他想起了更多难忘的日子
It reminded him of more noble days.

46
00:09:33,342 --> 00:09:35,927
它有着这么多不幸的事
It bears so many sorrows.

47
00:09:39,264 --> 00:09:41,099
最难忘的是
One above all.

48
00:09:42,058 --> 00:09:43,977
李慕白
Li Mu Bai.

49
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,771
我曾是他的学生    那时你们都在这儿
I was his student when you were both here.

50
00:09:48,524 --> 00:09:51,067
他的死触动了我们所有人
His death touched us all.

51
00:09:52,652 --> 00:09:56,323
我父亲    他以为你们会共结连理
My father, he thought you would wed.

52
00:09:58,575 --> 00:10:00,536
我们不会
We could not.

53
00:10:00,618 --> 00:10:02,120
我和另一个人已有婚约
I was promised to another.

54
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,835
它应该被藏起来
It should be locked away.

55
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,256
铁贝勒已经死了
A great lord has died,

56
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,758
你想利用这段混乱的时间
and you seek to use this time of chaos

57
00:10:15,842 --> 00:10:19,262
成为武林至尊
to emerge as the one true leader of the Martial World.

58
00:10:19,346 --> 00:10:20,265
你能看透我的心思？
Do you read my mind?

59
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,265
我能看到你的野心
No. Your ambition.

60
00:10:23,058 --> 00:10:25,602
那把刀很好
This sword is great,

61
00:10:25,685 --> 00:10:28,646
但还有一把更好的
but there is one greater.

62
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,315
青冥宝剑
The Green Destiny.

63
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,282
青冥宝剑已经消失了很多年了
The Green Destiny was lost long years ago.

64
00:10:39,366 --> 00:10:42,536
并没有消失     是被藏了起来
Not lost. Hidden.

65
00:10:42,619 --> 00:10:45,121
就在铁贝勒府
Kept by the House of Te.

66
00:10:45,205 --> 00:10:48,166
我该在贝勒府掀起一场血雨腥风吗？
Am I to storm the home of the Emperor's brother?

67
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:54,797
只需要让一个人去即可
Send instead a single drop of rain.

68
00:10:56,508 --> 00:10:57,926
他
The boy...

69
00:10:58,801 --> 00:11:01,054
他失败了一次     刚刚爬回家
who crawled home from failure?

70
00:11:01,137 --> 00:11:04,057
那不是魏方一个人的错
The fault is not Wei-Fang's alone.

71
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,476
他武艺尚浅
His training is not complete.

72
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,313
让他去做这件事无异于自杀
To send him on this mission alone would be suicide.

73
00:11:10,397 --> 00:11:11,222
也许我可以
Perhaps I can-

74
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,732
是他带我来见你
He brought me to you.

75
00:11:12,815 --> 00:11:14,568
让他去
Send the boy.

76
00:11:14,651 --> 00:11:16,945
他和剑的命运是束缚在一起的
He and the sword are bound by fate.

77
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:20,115
我已经看到了
I have seen it.

78
00:12:15,753 --> 00:12:17,755
那位年轻的小姐是谁
Who is that young lady?

79
00:12:19,215 --> 00:12:22,051
我想是位官员的女儿
I believe the daughter of an official.

80
00:12:22,135 --> 00:12:25,221
有很多人前来吊丧
Many have come to pay their respects.

81
00:15:15,975 --> 00:15:17,602
贼！  家里进贼了！
Thief! Thief in the house!

82
00:15:31,616 --> 00:15:32,659
这人是谁？
Who is this man?

83
00:15:33,451 --> 00:15:34,786
我听到些动静
I heard a disturbance.

84
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,872
他试图偷剑
He was trying to steal the sword.

85
00:15:36,996 --> 00:15:38,623
我试图偷...?
I was trying to steal--?

86
00:15:40,792 --> 00:15:42,585
抓住他了
We caught the thief.

87
00:15:42,669 --> 00:15:44,295
他不止是贼
He is more than a thief.

88
00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:47,549
它是西莲派的      是他袭击了我的马车
He is West Lotus.He attacked my carriage.

89
00:15:51,135 --> 00:15:52,639
把他带到衙门
Take him to the Marshal.

90
00:15:52,739 --> 00:15:54,639
不     把他关在这里
No. Keep him here.

91
00:15:54,723 --> 00:15:58,560
戴阎王不会随便指派个人来
Hades Dai would not assign this mission lightly.

92
00:15:58,643 --> 00:16:02,480
如果这个人对他有价值      对我们也一样
If the boy has value to him,he may yet have value to us.

93
00:16:03,606 --> 00:16:05,483
好吧
Very well.

94
00:16:05,567 --> 00:16:07,777
把他关在院子里
Confine him and secure the compound.

95
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:31,342
会对这个男的做什么？
What will happen to him? The boy?

96
00:16:31,426 --> 00:16:32,802
你是谁？
Who are you?

97
00:16:32,886 --> 00:16:34,679
我叫雪瓶
I am called Snow Vase.

98
00:16:35,471 --> 00:16:38,099
我来祭奠铁贝勒
I came to pay my respects to Sir Te.

99
00:16:38,182 --> 00:16:40,268
你很关心这个贼？
And your concern for the thief?

100
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:44,272
只是对奇怪的事有些好奇
You mistake curiosity for concern.

101
00:16:52,655 --> 00:16:54,866
这把剑像他们说的那般厉害吗？
Is it as powerful as they say?

102
00:16:58,745 --> 00:17:00,329
在正确的人手里是
In the right hand.

103
00:17:34,322 --> 00:17:35,406
教教我
Teach me.

104
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:37,366
你学的够好了
You have been well taught already.

105
00:17:40,202 --> 00:17:41,663
我想学更多武艺
I want to learn more.

106
00:17:42,914 --> 00:17:45,792
像你这般
I want to walk the path you followed.

107
00:17:52,465 --> 00:17:55,760
我会照顾你一辈子
I will serve you for life.

108
00:17:58,805 --> 00:18:01,223
我不需要丫环      雪瓶
I don't need a servant, Snow Vase.

109
00:18:01,307 --> 00:18:05,061
我一向独来独往      并且很快会回到这种生活
My life is solitude,and I return to it shortly.

110
00:18:05,144 --> 00:18:08,105
如果你想寻求一位师父的话      请到别处
If you seek a teacher,you must look elsewhere.

111
00:18:28,334 --> 00:18:30,753
这么冷的一夜      都不能让你松口？
Did a night in the cold loosen your tongue?

112
00:18:30,837 --> 00:18:32,797
把笼子打开      我会把你的牙打掉
Open this cage and I'll loosen your teeth.

113
00:18:36,467 --> 00:18:37,635
够了
That's enough!

114
00:18:43,391 --> 00:18:44,518
你叫什么名字
What is your name?

115
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,518
魏方
Wei-Fang.

116
00:18:47,144 --> 00:18:51,190
戴阎王想要那把剑？
So, Hades Dai wants the sword？

117
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:57,030
现在让我带这把剑走      你们还有一条活路
Let me leave with the sword now and you'll be spared.

118
00:18:57,113 --> 00:18:59,532
否则    血染贝勒府
Otherwise, this house will swim with blood.

119
00:19:02,077 --> 00:19:03,828
必须给皇上送个口信
Word must be sent to the Emperor.

120
00:19:03,912 --> 00:19:06,288
京城以南恐有争斗
There is war in the south.

121
00:19:06,372 --> 00:19:10,167
我不能以江湖纷争打扰他
I cannot trouble him with these underworld affairs.

122
00:19:10,251 --> 00:19:12,670
皇上也从不听信我们父子的只言片语
The Emperor doesn't heed my words as he did my father's.

123
00:19:12,754 --> 00:19:15,548
剑必须马上转移走
The sword must be removed from here at once.

124
00:19:15,631 --> 00:19:17,133
它在这里很安全    秀莲
It is safest here, Xiu Lien.

125
00:19:17,216 --> 00:19:20,261
如果西莲派要夺走它      放在哪里都不安全
Nothing is safe if West Lotus claims that sword.

126
00:19:20,344 --> 00:19:23,472
剑必须被带到武当派藏于山中
It must be taken to Wudang Temple,high up in the mountains.

127
00:19:23,556 --> 00:19:26,142
不   我曾对先父起誓
No. I made an oath to my father

128
00:19:26,225 --> 00:19:29,687
将青冥宝剑守护在贝勒府
that I would guard and protect the Green Destiny within these walls.

129
00:19:29,771 --> 00:19:32,065
铁贝勒在天之灵会明白的
Sir Te would understand.

130
00:19:32,148 --> 00:19:36,318
你作为一家之主      众人尊敬
You've earned your place in this house and much respect beyond.

131
00:19:36,402 --> 00:19:38,613
只有你这么说    秀莲
Only from you, Xiu Lien.

132
00:19:38,696 --> 00:19:40,448
一直没变
It was always that way.

133
00:19:40,531 --> 00:19:42,283
你先听我说
Then listen to me now.

134
00:19:42,366 --> 00:19:46,788
假如戴阎王真的来了      他只会鸡犬不留
If Hades Dai comes here,he'll leave nothing standing.

135
00:19:46,871 --> 00:19:50,249
没有人会活下去      我们没有别的选择
No one alive.We have no choice.

136
00:19:51,042 --> 00:19:56,338
我对我父亲的誓言      是我受人尊敬的根本
The promise that I made my father is all I have to earn honor in this house.

137
00:19:57,339 --> 00:19:59,926
这才是我余生最重要的     秀莲
It is worth my life, Xiu Lien.

138
00:20:02,303 --> 00:20:04,097
我们必须让客人离开
We must ask the guests to leave.

139
00:20:06,432 --> 00:20:10,436
你会留在这里吗？     你与我父亲总是互帮互助
Will you stay? You always came to my father's aid and he to yours.

140
00:20:11,646 --> 00:20:13,355
你会帮我吗？
Will you help?

141
00:20:16,275 --> 00:20:18,360
只要需要      我会一直留在这里
I will stay as long as I am needed.

142
00:20:19,361 --> 00:20:21,405
我会恳请客人离开
I will bid the guests to leave.

143
00:20:21,489 --> 00:20:23,866
留下那个喊贼的女人
Keep the girl who caught the thief.

144
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:26,285
她让我教他武艺
She has asked me to teach her...

145
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,872
但是我怀疑她另有所想
but I suspect she can teach us.

146
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,001
我们也需要更多的兵器
We will need more arms.

147
00:20:33,084 --> 00:20:35,294
我会补充护卫
I will hire extra guards.

148
00:20:35,377 --> 00:20:38,923
我们需要的不是简单的护卫
We need those who will do more than guard.

149
00:20:39,007 --> 00:20:43,469
而是一些侠义之士
There are warriors who once stood against this type of injustice.

150
00:20:45,596 --> 00:20:49,266
肝胆相照
True followers will still answer the call.

151
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:52,478
侠义不只是道听途说...
The Iron Way is not legend...

152
00:20:52,561 --> 00:20:54,355
远远不是
not yet.

153
00:21:37,481 --> 00:21:38,900
我告诉你      我很讲信用
I'm telling you, I'm good for it.

154
00:21:38,983 --> 00:21:41,027
你根本就是言而无信
You are good for nothing.

155
00:22:28,241 --> 00:22:30,201
我们就是告示上要找的人
We're good for your warrant.

156
00:22:30,285 --> 00:22:35,123
我有29个弟兄      每个人头20两纹银
I have 30 swords at 20 ounces of silver a head.

157
00:22:35,206 --> 00:22:36,707
那是...
That's...

158
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:41,045
600两纹银...     可惜了
six hundred ounces of silver... wasted.

159
00:22:42,213 --> 00:22:45,633
铁贝勒文武双全      受人敬仰
Sir Te was honored by masters of pen and sword alike.

160
00:22:45,716 --> 00:22:50,471
如果他的家人需要      侠肝义胆之士都会相应其号召
If his house has need, men of the Iron Way should heed for the honor of his cause,

161
00:22:50,554 --> 00:22:52,723
不取分毫
not promise of riches.

162
00:22:52,807 --> 00:22:54,725
这位朋友说得好
My friend is right.

163
00:22:55,643 --> 00:22:58,104
这告示不是给你看的
This warrant is not for you.

164
00:23:00,564 --> 00:23:02,524
如果我说是哪？
And if I say it is?

165
00:23:28,092 --> 00:23:29,927
想想再说
Think about it.

166
00:23:31,595 --> 00:23:33,348
别急于说出口
They're not that fast.

167
00:23:34,307 --> 00:23:38,435
大言不惭...     就凭你
Big words for a little man...all alone.

168
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:39,520
他可不是一个人
He's not alone.

169
00:23:40,938 --> 00:23:43,024
我和他一起的
I stand with him.

170
00:23:43,107 --> 00:23:47,028
山东飞刀    愿听差遣
Flying Blade of Shantung,at your service.

171
00:23:48,112 --> 00:23:49,697
我也一样
As am I.

172
00:23:51,573 --> 00:23:54,327
浙江 - 陈一雷
Thunder Fist Chan, famed in Zhejiang.

173
00:23:55,077 --> 00:23:56,996
还有我
And I,

174
00:23:57,079 --> 00:24:01,125
福州 - 史银镖
Silver Dart Shi.Famed in Fuzhou.

175
00:24:02,126 --> 00:24:08,924
还有我    马贵      四海为家
And I, Turtle Ma.Famed in... this tavern.

176
00:27:07,769 --> 00:27:09,980
你是谁
Who are you?

177
00:27:11,357 --> 00:27:13,568
我被叫作独狼
I'm known as Silent Wolf.

178
00:27:15,736 --> 00:27:18,364
看来桌子都要重做了
We'll have to rebuild all the tables!

179
00:27:19,574 --> 00:27:21,200
是谁威胁着铁贝勒府
Who threatens the House of Te?

180
00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:23,369
西莲派
West Lotus.

181
00:27:23,452 --> 00:27:25,746
我需要一些侠客守护贝勒府
I need swords to protect its walls.

182
00:27:25,829 --> 00:27:27,456
现在至少四个人了
Now you have four more.

183
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,918
算上我一个
To add to your army.

184
00:27:28,918 --> 00:27:30,918
你需要多少个人
How many, in your army?

185
00:27:31,201 --> 00:27:32,001
五个人
Five.

186
00:27:32,261 --> 00:27:33,040
五百人
Hundred?

187
00:27:33,445 --> 00:27:34,463
五个人
Five.

188
00:27:38,593 --> 00:27:41,596
不断跑动可以一敌百
Well, better five that can fight than 500 that can run.

189
00:27:41,678 --> 00:27:44,014
我想喝一杯
I need a drink.

190
00:27:49,228 --> 00:27:53,190
不要钱    也别再回来了
On the house. Never come back.

191
00:28:42,906 --> 00:28:45,075
我现在开始教你
Let the training begin.

192
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:56,420
不要只用眼看      也要用心听
Do not just watch with your eyes,listen with your mind.

193
00:28:59,923 --> 00:29:01,216
再试一次
Again.

194
00:29:06,221 --> 00:29:08,015
再试一次
Again.

195
00:29:10,809 --> 00:29:12,478
你对那个人很好奇
Your curiosity with the boy...

196
00:29:12,561 --> 00:29:14,480
我不是好奇
I'm not curious.

197
00:29:14,563 --> 00:29:16,732
难道是我看错了？
Then what do I now mistake for curiosity?

198
00:29:18,066 --> 00:29:19,151
无可救药！
Hopeless!

199
00:29:19,234 --> 00:29:20,402
多管闲事
Irritation.

200
00:29:21,529 --> 00:29:22,822
必须在这练武吗？
Must we train here?

201
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,822
是
Yes.

202
00:29:23,905 --> 00:29:26,575
一股脑儿可学不到真本事
True skill is not a blazing flame.

203
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,930
再试一次
Again.

204
00:29:49,515 --> 00:29:50,849
过于努力了！
Too much blazing flame!

205
00:29:50,932 --> 00:29:52,809
与你无关
This does not concern you!

206
00:30:00,484 --> 00:30:02,570
即便你毁上千根木棍  上千把剑
A thousand broken sticks and swords

207
00:30:02,653 --> 00:30:05,989
只要你不平心静气      什么也学不会
won't teach as much as the one that bends to your will.

208
00:30:11,036 --> 00:30:13,498
无论怎样做都可以       只要碰得到我
Touch me, however you can.

209
00:30:13,666 --> 00:30:14,798
对我也行
Or me!

210
00:30:14,982 --> 00:30:17,125
别理他       来吧。
Ignore him. Strike me.

211
00:30:22,757 --> 00:30:25,175
招式路数太明显了
The predictable attack has a predictable outcome.

212
00:30:27,344 --> 00:30:28,512
再来
Again.

213
00:30:38,021 --> 00:30:39,523
一直练习
Keep practicing.

214
00:30:41,316 --> 00:30:42,401
要变幻莫测
Be unpredictable.

215
00:30:47,448 --> 00:30:49,533
轻功
Light Body Skill.

216
00:30:49,617 --> 00:30:51,118
你从哪学的
Where did you learn that?

217
00:30:51,201 --> 00:30:54,246
我师傅教我的
My teacher. She taught me.

218
00:30:54,329 --> 00:30:57,874
看起来你师傅是一个女人
So, your teacher was a woman.

219
00:31:01,086 --> 00:31:02,421
她叫什么名字
What is her name?

220
00:31:04,339 --> 00:31:05,800
你不会知道她的
You would not know it.

221
00:31:07,843 --> 00:31:09,886
为什么你不跟她学的时间长一点
And why do you no longer study with her?

222
00:31:24,901 --> 00:31:26,278
她死了
She died.

223
00:31:27,028 --> 00:31:28,196
很多年了
Years ago.

224
00:31:30,699 --> 00:31:31,700
我明白了
I see.

225
00:31:36,913 --> 00:31:38,874
我会勤加练习
I will practice.

226
00:31:38,957 --> 00:31:41,001
你不会白教的
Your patience will be rewarded.

227
00:31:59,478 --> 00:32:00,896
也许你应该换一个大点的孔
Perhaps you need a bigger hole.

228
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:05,693
比如你那张一直张开的嘴
Like your mouth, which is always open.

229
00:32:05,776 --> 00:32:07,194
倒是值得一试
I could try that.

230
00:32:07,277 --> 00:32:08,529
也可以
You could try...

231
00:32:08,612 --> 00:32:10,698
你也可以放我走
Or you could let me go.

232
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:16,161
放你走？   让你可以偷一次？
Let you go? So you can thieve again?

233
00:32:16,244 --> 00:32:19,956
带着剑给那个大恶人戴阎王
Bring your spoils to that monster Hades Dai?

234
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,376
戴掌门是个十分厉害的人
Lord Dai is a great warrior.

235
00:32:22,459 --> 00:32:25,838
在他的统领下      武林将会风平浪静
Under his hand,the Martial World will be peaceful.

236
00:32:26,505 --> 00:32:29,090
你师傅是个杀人犯
Your master is a murderer.

237
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:51,488
啊，陈一雷
Ah, Thunder Fist Chan.

238
00:32:51,572 --> 00:32:57,327
五两银子典当你的兵器对你来说       一定是件悲惨的事
Things must be quite dire for you to pledge your sword for five measly taels of silver.

239
00:32:57,411 --> 00:32:59,705
这年头没镖压了吗？
No gold convoys going out this season?

240
00:32:59,788 --> 00:33:02,583
我那是在保护我的兵器不被抢走
I was protecting that convoy from raiders,

241
00:33:02,666 --> 00:33:04,668
尤其是你这种受雇的人
raiders that you hired out to.

242
00:33:07,462 --> 00:33:11,174
那些来自浙江的拳手       总是找合适他们的理由
How these southern boxers from Zhejiang retell history when it suits them.

243
00:33:11,258 --> 00:33:13,093
你在嘲笑浙江人吗？
You mock Zhejiang, do you?

244
00:33:13,176 --> 00:33:16,221
别介意     我们都是为一件事聚才一起
Easy, boys.We have all been hired for the same cause.

245
00:33:17,222 --> 00:33:19,433
但是有人确切的知道是什么吗？
But does anyone know what that is exactly?

246
00:33:20,434 --> 00:33:22,519
因为我们都能喝吗？
All the wine we can drink?

247
00:33:22,603 --> 00:33:24,479
我不敢苟同
I didn't hear that part, Ma.

248
00:33:24,563 --> 00:33:27,315
算是原因之一
It was implied.

249
00:33:37,367 --> 00:33:40,579
我听到些风言风语
I heard whispers that it's kept there.

250
00:33:40,662 --> 00:33:42,497
铁贝勒府
In the House of Te.

251
00:33:43,916 --> 00:33:45,417
青冥宝剑一直在那
The Green Destiny.

252
00:33:47,962 --> 00:33:49,797
剑的铸造
The blade was forged

253
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,133
可以追溯到先秦
Forged with a technique that dates back to the Qin era.

254
00:33:53,216 --> 00:33:55,302
锻造的方法没有传下来   (指吴国的揉剑法)
A technique lost to history.

255
00:33:55,385 --> 00:34:00,790
由一种特殊材料锻造   (先秦的时候，有大马士革钢这种说法？)
A blade that could carve through Damascus steel.

256
00:34:01,182 --> 00:34:05,729
最后手持这把剑的人在一场决斗中被击败了
Nobody who was wielding the blade was ever defeated in a duel or battle.

257
00:34:07,856 --> 00:34:10,901
独狼       这是真的吗？
Silent Wolf, is this true?

258
00:34:10,985 --> 00:34:12,694
我们是去守剑的吗？
Are we being hired to guard a sword?

259
00:34:15,614 --> 00:34:17,950
我很好奇他怎么起了这么一个名字
I wonder how he got his name.

260
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,028
恭迎各位到来
I bid you welcome.

261
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:28,186
失陪了
Excuse me.

262
00:35:55,338 --> 00:35:58,800
解释一下    一个人是怎样起死回生的
Explain how a man returns from the dead.

263
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:02,596
我们订婚了
We were to wed.

264
00:36:03,889 --> 00:36:05,891
我也为你感到哀痛
I mourned for you.

265
00:36:11,438 --> 00:36:13,189
秀莲
Xiu Lian

266
00:36:13,273 --> 00:36:16,234
你不要说那个名字
That name is not yours to speak.

267
00:36:22,198 --> 00:36:25,785
我在那场决斗之前心已经死了    很早以前
I was dead before that duel，Long before

268
00:36:28,872 --> 00:36:32,167
我这么做是为了你和李慕白
I did it for you and Li Mu Bai.

269
00:36:36,004 --> 00:36:39,549
我知道你爱的是他    不是我
I knew you loved him, not me.

270
00:36:48,183 --> 00:36:51,645
我和戴阎王在灵鹫峰的决斗
When Hades Dai and I fought on Vulture's Peak...

271
00:36:56,191 --> 00:36:58,234
是我唯一能看到的出路
...I took the only path I could see.

272
00:37:14,835 --> 00:37:18,088
戴阎王以为我死了
Hades Dai left me for dead.

273
00:37:26,888 --> 00:37:29,516
而我留在山上
I made my way to the mountains,

274
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,060
选择独自隐居
and chose a life of solitude.

275
00:37:33,979 --> 00:37:39,109
在哪之前...     我发现慕白和我追求的...
Up there... I found what Mu Bai and I had strived for...

276
00:37:40,443 --> 00:37:42,112
我无法面对...
detachment...

277
00:37:43,404 --> 00:37:45,740
后来我想开了
enlightenment.

278
00:37:53,665 --> 00:37:59,087
我离开     是因为我知道只要我还活着
I stayed away because I knew that as long as I was alive,

279
00:37:59,171 --> 00:38:01,215
慕白是不会向你求婚的
Mu Bai would not ask you to marry him.

280
00:38:01,297 --> 00:38:03,675
即便你死了
Nor in your death.

281
00:38:04,425 --> 00:38:07,095
他也没有这么做
Such was his honor.

282
00:38:07,179 --> 00:38:08,972
你装死什么意义也没有
You feigned your death for nothing.

283
00:38:11,016 --> 00:38:12,809
不是装死
It wasn't feigned.

284
00:38:16,271 --> 00:38:18,106
我切身感受到了
It was deeply felt.

285
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:22,485
那只是你一厢情愿      你让我们所有人都相信了
That was your choice,and you made it for all of us.

286
00:38:26,698 --> 00:38:31,036
在你死后我已经心境平和了     以后也是
I have made peace with your passing, and so it will remain.

287
00:38:33,872 --> 00:38:37,125
你留在这里       是因为需要你
You are needed and you're here.

288
00:38:37,209 --> 00:38:40,378
你的本领和胆识还没有被忘记
Your skill and courage are not forgotten.

289
00:38:42,463 --> 00:38:44,299
再无其他
All else is.

290
00:39:04,194 --> 00:39:05,528
你是谁
And you are?

291
00:39:06,196 --> 00:39:07,572
雪瓶
Snow Vase.

292
00:39:07,655 --> 00:39:10,284
俞秀莲的徒弟
Student of Master Yu Shu Lien.

293
00:39:13,411 --> 00:39:16,081
我还不知道她还有一个徒弟
I have not known her to take a student.

294
00:39:16,164 --> 00:39:17,291
现在你知道了
So you know her well.

295
00:39:17,373 --> 00:39:18,833
嗯
Well enough.

296
00:39:18,917 --> 00:39:20,210
怎么了？
How?

297
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:25,966
这儿不是多说的地方
This is not the place for story.

298
00:39:31,596 --> 00:39:33,598
那以后再说
Another time, then.

299
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:38,145
你师傅...
Your teacher...

300
00:39:40,521 --> 00:39:41,606
她怎么样？
is she content?

301
00:39:41,689 --> 00:39:43,150
她很伤心
She's in mourning.

302
00:39:44,192 --> 00:39:45,693
我知道
Of course.

303
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,488
不只是因为铁贝勒
I do not speak just of Sir Te.

304
00:40:32,032 --> 00:40:34,117
你动作真轻
You move as quietly as ever.

305
00:40:35,451 --> 00:40:38,372
再轻你也听到了
Not so quiet that you will not hear.

306
00:40:40,498 --> 00:40:41,791
你收了一个徒弟
You have taken a student.

307
00:40:42,458 --> 00:40:43,793
是
Yes.

308
00:40:45,337 --> 00:40:49,590
她和笼子里那个人       有些莫名的联系
They are connected somehow,she and that boy.

309
00:40:52,135 --> 00:40:56,514
那个人走入歧途       但我能感到一颗单纯的心
He roars, but I feel a gentle soul may sleep within.

310
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,577
你的徒弟那？
And your student?

311
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,019
我不太确定
I am not certain.

312
00:41:01,102 --> 00:41:02,937
我从她眼神里看到了一丝阴暗
I see darkness in her eyes.

313
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:06,691
对她可能是一个凶兆
She could be an even greater threat.

314
00:41:06,774 --> 00:41:08,484
对我也是
To us...

315
00:41:09,777 --> 00:41:11,654
这些守卫顶得住吗？
or those we guard against?

316
00:41:11,738 --> 00:41:13,240
事后才能知道
Time will tell.

317
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,831
雪瓶的师傅可能是寒梅  (玉娇龙)
Her teacher may have been Han Mei,

318
00:41:21,915 --> 00:41:25,001
背离武当的那个女侠
the renegade swordswoman from Willow Valley.

319
00:41:26,336 --> 00:41:28,088
她已经死去很多年了
She's gone many years.

320
00:41:28,755 --> 00:41:31,674
那她教雪瓶的时候一定很年轻
So she taught Snow Vase quite young.

321
00:41:32,717 --> 00:41:33,760
太桀骜不驯
Too young.

322
00:42:27,981 --> 00:42:29,565
雪瓶小姐？
Miss Snow Vase?

323
00:42:29,649 --> 00:42:30,827
来和我们喝一杯
Raise a cup with us.

324
00:42:31,249 --> 00:42:32,527
来吧
Yes, come in.

325
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:35,863
来吧,雪瓶？
Come on, Snow？

326
00:42:43,163 --> 00:42:47,583
敬铁贝勒
Mm-hm. To Sir Te and to his House.

327
00:42:50,878 --> 00:42:56,468
他们说一个能够拿起酒杯的女人     才是男人想要的女人
They say a woman who can hold her wine is a woman a man will want to hold.

328
00:42:56,551 --> 00:42:57,712
谁说的？
Who says that?

329
00:42:57,851 --> 00:42:59,012
我说的
I do.

330
00:43:06,811 --> 00:43:09,063
我们喝酒是为了记起一些事
We drink to remember,

331
00:43:09,147 --> 00:43:12,526
但是你们喝酒是为了忘记一些事
but it seems you drink to forget.

332
00:43:17,822 --> 00:43:19,866
何从谈起？
How do you take the measure of a man?

333
00:43:19,949 --> 00:43:21,451
你是从哪看出来的？
Which part of a man？

334
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:24,329
举手投足间
Ma, behave.

335
00:43:24,412 --> 00:43:26,581
当我没问
I said nothing.

336
00:43:26,664 --> 00:43:28,416
酒后胡言
The wine was asking.

337
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,377
那就别问
Ask your heart.

338
00:43:31,127 --> 00:43:34,130
你说得对
I do. My head answers.

339
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:38,009
这会有惨烈的一仗
The greatest battle of them all.

340
00:43:38,092 --> 00:43:40,345
你也不是独自一个人
And you are hardly the only who fights it here.

341
00:43:41,388 --> 00:43:42,638
独狼在哪？
Where is Silent Wolf?

342
00:43:42,722 --> 00:43:45,016
他和陈一雷在一起
He guards with Thunder Fist.

343
00:43:46,642 --> 00:43:49,604
我想打听下     俞师傅     她有什么嗜好
So Master Yu, what is she like?

344
00:43:52,607 --> 00:43:54,442
静下心来
Pierce its heart.

345
00:43:54,526 --> 00:43:58,405
武艺的要诀是
True skill is a key in the moon.

346
00:43:58,488 --> 00:44:01,699
耳听八方
Listen... with your nose.

347
00:44:03,326 --> 00:44:06,287
眼观六路
A predictable attack has a predictable

348
00:44:28,184 --> 00:44:30,562
你让我教你
You asked to be taught.

349
00:44:30,645 --> 00:44:32,855
你就必须要明白        你要学的还有很多
And clearly,there is much you need to learn.

350
00:44:32,939 --> 00:44:34,482
师傅        要做多久
How long, teacher?

351
00:44:44,576 --> 00:44:48,079
这根木棍的影子从这到那
Until the shadow moves from here to there.

352
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:51,958
两次
Twice.

353
00:45:17,024 --> 00:45:18,776
你学的很快
You learn quickly.

354
00:45:20,153 --> 00:45:21,946
很好
That's good.

355
00:45:37,712 --> 00:45:40,298
雪瓶        你对她了解多少
Snow Vase. How do you know her?

356
00:45:40,381 --> 00:45:41,675
一点也不了解
I do not.

357
00:45:41,757 --> 00:45:43,843
那她对你感兴趣
Then her interest in you?

358
00:45:58,358 --> 00:46:01,569
你师傅说你对我有些兴趣        真的吗？
Your master believes you have interest in me. True?

359
00:46:03,738 --> 00:46:07,367
说句话      我很无聊
Talk to me. I am bored.

360
00:46:08,493 --> 00:46:09,200
孤独
Lonely.

361
00:46:09,493 --> 00:46:10,495
与我无关
Neither is my problem.

362
00:46:10,578 --> 00:46:12,289
如果有关那？
But what if you are their solution?

363
00:46:12,578 --> 00:46:13,289
别说了
Stop talking.

364
00:46:14,666 --> 00:46:17,835
如果你笑一个        我保证不再多说一句
A single smile and you have my word. I will fall silent.

365
00:46:18,753 --> 00:46:20,796
你已经多说了一句        你怎么闭嘴？
How can you fall silent and yet give a word?

366
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,675
你为什么总是这么冰冷        没有一点笑容？
How can you hold so much wine and not smile?

367
00:47:05,508 --> 00:47:09,429
这是红沙帮的地盘
This is territory allied to the Red Desert clan.

368
00:47:09,512 --> 00:47:11,431
我们已经断了他们的后路
We have cut off their supply.

369
00:47:12,098 --> 00:47:14,058
明晚
Come the New Moon,

370
00:47:14,141 --> 00:47:17,645
西莲派会占据整个地盘
West Lotus will own this entire territory.

371
00:47:18,605 --> 00:47:21,065
但也只不过是在灵宝
But this is merely Lingbao.

372
00:47:22,108 --> 00:47:23,735
不是北京的贝勒府
Not Peking.

373
00:47:25,528 --> 00:47:28,197
我会派一部分人去北京
Mantis will go where an army cannot.

374
00:47:29,407 --> 00:47:34,078
而你们聚集在黄河边准备迎战
While you soldiers will gather at the Twin Rivers and prepare for war

375
00:47:34,161 --> 00:47:36,914
面对武林中的所有对手
against all rival clans in the Martial World.

376
00:47:38,207 --> 00:47:40,585
魏方没有做到的我会做到
I will succeed where Wei-Fang did not.

377
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:51,846
现在你看到了什么        先知？
What do you see now, prophet?

378
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:56,142
什么也没有
I see nothing,

379
00:47:56,225 --> 00:47:58,519
但是我听到了一些
but I hear word.

380
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:03,274
就像你听到的        魏方会偷剑成功？
Just as you heard word that Wei-Fang would succeed in his raid?

381
00:48:03,357 --> 00:48:05,276
再说错一次
Give another false prophecy,

382
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:08,904
你不仅会没有眼睛        舌头也会没有
you'll not only have no eyes, you'll have no tongue.

383
00:48:08,988 --> 00:48:14,910
但那时你就不会知道贝勒府的贵客是谁了
But then you wouldn't know of the honored guest who now resides at the House of Te

384
00:48:16,412 --> 00:48:20,750
一个死里逃生的人
One thought long dead has returned.

385
00:48:23,628 --> 00:48:26,380
一雷守住南院
Thunder Fist will guard the south gate.

386
00:48:26,464 --> 00:48:29,133
马贵        我们这很容易受到攻击
Turtle Ma,we are vulnerable here.

387
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:46,794
有人来了
Guard!

388
00:50:56,322 --> 00:50:58,282
他们来救我了
They've come for me.

389
00:50:58,365 --> 00:51:00,034
我才能救你
I've come for you.

390
00:51:00,743 --> 00:51:04,288
他们只会鸡犬不留
They leave destruction,death in their wake.

391
00:51:04,371 --> 00:51:06,666
你还和他们一起吗？
Do you still stand with them?

392
00:51:09,502 --> 00:51:13,380
你还和他们一起吗？
Do you still stand with them?

393
00:51:41,492 --> 00:51:42,660
小心背后
Look out.

394
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:50,793
剑在哪？
Where's the sword?

395
00:51:50,877 --> 00:51:52,545
他不知道
He does not know.

396
00:52:00,970 --> 00:52:02,596
剑在东院
The sword is in the east courtyard.

397
00:52:03,138 --> 00:52:05,474
一旦我拿到了剑       第一个要死的就是你
Once I hold the blade, you will be the first to fall.

398
00:52:20,698 --> 00:52:22,783
你找不到的
You will not find it there,

399
00:52:22,867 --> 00:52:25,160
剑在我这
nor take it from here.

400
00:52:30,332 --> 00:52:31,542
俞师傅
Master Yu!

401
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:36,213
放他走
Let him go.

402
00:52:44,304 --> 00:52:45,472
放开他
Release him.

403
00:52:45,556 --> 00:52:48,935
把剑给我        否则就是他死
Give it to me now or he dies!

404
00:52:49,018 --> 00:52:51,311
贝勒府也会没落
The House of Te will fall.

405
00:52:51,395 --> 00:52:54,732
侠义之道也会随之没落
As will the followers of the Iron Way.

406
00:52:54,815 --> 00:52:55,983
你是谁？
Who are you?

407
00:52:57,777 --> 00:53:00,613
我父母被你手里的这把剑所杀
My parents were slain by the sword you hold.

408
00:53:01,321 --> 00:53:05,993
每一个夜晚        我都能听到他们在地府叮嘱我
On clear nights, I still hear them calling to me from the other world.

409
00:53:07,369 --> 00:53:09,122
只有一句话
One word...

410
00:53:09,663 --> 00:53:11,331
报仇
vengeance.

411
00:53:31,936 --> 00:53:34,772
为了那么一点小钱送死        多可怜啊！
Such a pity to die for a fee！

412
00:53:40,069 --> 00:53:42,404
不是为了钱       是侠义
Not for gold, it's for the Iron Way.

413
00:53:47,994 --> 00:53:52,999
我弟弟就是因此而死        一点也不值得
My brother died for the Iron Way.It was worthless.

414
00:53:53,082 --> 00:53:55,960
你应该找个好点的理由
You should have found yourself a better cause,

415
00:53:56,043 --> 00:53:57,419
或者像我一样
as I did.

416
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:02,299
史银镖！     滚开！
Shi! No! Get away from her!

417
00:54:53,684 --> 00:54:55,144
马贵...
Turtle Ma...

418
00:55:06,613 --> 00:55:09,533
史银镖
Silver Dart Shi.Famed in Fuzhou.

419
00:55:12,494 --> 00:55:16,290
还有铁贝子    (贝勒的儿子叫贝子)
And now I mourn the death of Sir Te Zhao,

420
00:55:16,373 --> 00:55:19,919
你我情同手足
the son of the man who was like a father to me.

421
00:55:37,436 --> 00:55:39,521
所有这些都是因为一把剑
All this for a sword.

422
00:55:39,605 --> 00:55:42,482
侠义、胆识、名望
Code, duty, honor.

423
00:55:43,317 --> 00:55:47,529
他们都是因此而死
Excuses for bloodshed,all of them.

424
00:55:51,242 --> 00:55:53,493
这就是我为什么看淡名利
That is why I left it behind.

425
00:55:55,121 --> 00:55:57,539
心如止水
I was content.

426
00:55:57,623 --> 00:55:59,041
置身其外了
Above it all.

427
00:56:00,751 --> 00:56:03,796
现在我要做我该做的
And now a kite laments its return.

428
00:56:11,887 --> 00:56:13,931
带着这把剑离开
I will take the sword and leave.

429
00:56:16,016 --> 00:56:19,812
不       他们耳目众多
No. They watch the roads.

430
00:56:19,895 --> 00:56:21,188
在这够安全了
It is safer here.

431
00:56:21,272 --> 00:56:23,649
我不这么想
But I do not feel it.

432
00:56:24,733 --> 00:56:27,320
到处都弥漫着仇恨
Not when vengeance chokes the air.

433
00:56:40,499 --> 00:56:42,042
你救了我一命
You saved my life.

434
00:56:42,126 --> 00:56:44,003
我知道
I spoke before I thought.

435
00:56:44,795 --> 00:56:46,713
你很善良
Your words came from the heart.

436
00:57:09,528 --> 00:57:11,364
你母亲
Your mother...

437
00:57:12,281 --> 00:57:13,991
告诉我你知道的
tell me of her.

438
00:57:15,993 --> 00:57:17,000
为什么？
Why?

439
00:57:17,111 --> 00:57:18,704
她是什么样的人
What was she like?

440
00:57:21,165 --> 00:57:22,916
我没有母亲
I have no mother.

441
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:26,795
我被西莲派的铁乌鸦抚养长大
I was raised by Iron Crow of West Lotus.

442
00:57:27,921 --> 00:57:30,132
他竭尽所能的教我
He taught me everything I know,

443
00:57:30,216 --> 00:57:32,301
就像你师傅教你一样
as your teacher taught you.

444
00:57:38,682 --> 00:57:40,767
你学的很快
You learn fast.

445
00:57:41,601 --> 00:57:43,478
很有天分
Knowledge is in your blood.

446
00:57:44,355 --> 00:57:45,647
继续练
Again.

447
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:48,984
他让我感到亲情
He gave me a sense of purpose.

448
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:12,841
你母亲是凉州方知府的小妾
Your mother was a concubine.

449
00:58:13,926 --> 00:58:16,095
这你一定知道
Or so you've been told.

450
00:58:18,138 --> 00:58:18,888
你怎么知道
How do you

451
00:58:19,038 --> 00:58:20,140
我知道你的过去
I know your past.

452
00:58:21,808 --> 00:58:22,809
谁告诉你这些的
Who told you this?

453
00:58:27,856 --> 00:58:30,359
一位赫赫有名的女侠
A swordswoman of great renown.

454
00:58:31,444 --> 00:58:33,946
你真正的母亲叫做寒梅    (玉娇龙)
Your real mother was known as Han Mei.

455
00:58:49,253 --> 00:58:53,299
一个受过难以估量痛苦的女人。
A woman who had felt and brought immeasurable pain.

456
00:58:54,508 --> 00:58:57,428
她怀着的你
In her womb, she carried you,

457
00:58:57,511 --> 00:59:01,307
是她所爱的男人的最后一晚留下来的
the legacy from her last night with the man she loved.

458
00:59:07,438 --> 00:59:10,483
她怀的是一个男孩
Great is the joy of a child,

459
00:59:10,565 --> 00:59:13,986
并且有一个胎记
greater still, the value of a boy.

460
00:59:21,868 --> 00:59:23,370
当她睡下的时候
While she slept,

461
00:59:23,454 --> 00:59:27,624
前几天客栈里一个生了一个女儿的小妾
a concubine who had given birth to a daughter there days before...

462
00:59:29,168 --> 00:59:32,379
把你换成了那个女孩...
switched her worthless girl for you...

463
00:59:35,090 --> 00:59:39,761
如果她生出一个男孩的话       就能取悦他的丈夫
hoping it would please her master if she presented him with a son.

464
00:59:45,309 --> 00:59:48,103
当寒梅发现的时候已经晚了
When Han Mei realized what had been done...

465
00:59:49,355 --> 00:59:51,731
她本来打算抛弃这个女孩
she meant to abandon the girl.

466
00:59:54,443 --> 00:59:56,695
但是于心不忍
But her heart refused.

467
01:00:15,088 --> 01:00:18,800
她尝试着忘记你
She tried to wash from her skin he blood she had shed.

468
01:00:20,177 --> 01:00:24,723
但是你母亲无法摆脱这份骨肉之痛
But your mother could not be rid of the pain she had caused in her life.

469
01:00:32,898 --> 01:00:35,150
她视我如己出
She raised me as her own.

470
01:00:36,026 --> 01:00:38,653
授我侠义之道
Trained me in the Iron Way.

471
01:00:47,496 --> 01:00:50,707
那女人...     我母亲
The woman... My mother...

472
01:00:52,876 --> 01:00:54,711
有找过我吗？
Did she look for me?

473
01:00:56,796 --> 01:00:59,592
她每时每刻都在找你
Every minute of every day she searched.

474
01:01:12,271 --> 01:01:16,983
她打听到那个小妾为了保命       把你给了西莲派
She learned the concubine had given you to West Lotus to save her own life.

475
01:01:19,612 --> 01:01:22,322
为了找回你她挑战戴阎王
She challenged Hades Dai for your freedom.

476
01:02:10,870 --> 01:02:15,917
她画下了你的胎记叮嘱我找到你
She showed me your birth markand said, "You must find him.

477
01:02:16,001 --> 01:02:20,130
如果你是一个好人       就共扶侠义
If he is a good man, stand beside him.

478
01:02:21,632 --> 01:02:24,635
如果你是个坏人
If he has become a poison dragon...

479
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,346
就杀了你
kill him."

480
01:02:31,850 --> 01:02:33,935
你母亲
Your mother,

481
01:02:34,019 --> 01:02:35,688
我师傅
my teacher...

482
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:40,025
因找你而死
died trying to find you.

483
01:02:47,157 --> 01:02:50,536
这就是你我的故事
That is our story, yours and mine.

484
01:02:57,626 --> 01:02:58,793
等等
Wait.

485
01:03:00,003 --> 01:03:01,421
回来
Come back!

486
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,097
这是为了史银镖
This is for Shi!

487
01:03:11,181 --> 01:03:12,807
这是为了马贵
And this is for Ma!

488
01:03:12,891 --> 01:03:14,100
停手
Stop!

489
01:03:15,227 --> 01:03:16,688
他是西莲派的人
He is one of them!

490
01:03:16,827 --> 01:03:17,688
她说得对
She's right!

491
01:03:19,398 --> 01:03:21,024
这不是我们做事的方式
This is not our way.

492
01:03:31,744 --> 01:03:34,954
如果你要争斗       就应该公平一些
If you're going to fight, fight like men.

493
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:34,765
够了
Enough!

494
01:04:39,936 --> 01:04:41,563
有人把你教的很好
Someone taught you well.

495
01:04:41,647 --> 01:04:43,607
还不够好
Not well enough.

496
01:04:57,746 --> 01:04:59,205
师傅？
Teacher?

497
01:04:59,289 --> 01:05:00,332
进来
Come in.

498
01:05:09,508 --> 01:05:11,009
你要走了
You're leaving.

499
01:05:11,510 --> 01:05:13,679
剑不能留在这儿
The sword cannot be kept here.

500
01:05:15,221 --> 01:05:17,223
你要把它带到哪？
Where are you taking it?

501
01:05:17,307 --> 01:05:21,269
我不会告诉你的       太多人想得到它了
I would not burden you with that knowledge. Too many will hunt it.

502
01:05:22,187 --> 01:05:23,515
我能和你一起走吗？
Can I go with you?

503
01:05:23,887 --> 01:05:24,815
不行
No.

504
01:05:25,482 --> 01:05:27,901
我必须孤身一人
I must make this journey alone.

505
01:05:28,485 --> 01:05:30,320
独狼那？
What about Silent Wolf?

506
01:05:31,905 --> 01:05:32,906
跟你一起走吗？
Will he go?

507
01:05:32,989 --> 01:05:34,032
他为什么要跟我一起走
Why should he?

508
01:05:34,115 --> 01:05:35,826
我以为你们要一起走
I see the way you are together.

509
01:05:36,827 --> 01:05:38,787
你不再信任他了吗？
Is it that you don't trust him anymore?

510
01:05:41,164 --> 01:05:42,582
你说信任？
You speak of trust?

511
01:05:43,166 --> 01:05:45,669
你的师傅是寒梅
You, whose teacher who was Han Mei.

512
01:05:48,505 --> 01:05:50,298
你一直都知道？
You always knew?

513
01:05:51,383 --> 01:05:53,844
她在武当学的轻功
She learned her skills at Wudang.

514
01:05:55,053 --> 01:06:00,308
然后用它偷学武术背离武当
Then chose to use them for her own gain as an outlaw on the run.

515
01:06:01,643 --> 01:06:04,354
你以为我看不到你在步她的后尘吗？
You think I wouldn't see her shadow on your sword?

516
01:06:04,437 --> 01:06:07,524
我想把你从她的命运中拉出来
I wanted to save you from her fate.

517
01:06:07,607 --> 01:06:10,193
你对她一无所知
You know nothing of her fate.

518
01:06:11,069 --> 01:06:13,947
她死于那个屠夫戴阎王之手
Her life was lost to that butcher, Hades Dai.

519
01:06:15,073 --> 01:06:17,992
我想学艺用着把剑为她报仇
I sought the sword and your teachings to avenge her.

520
01:06:18,076 --> 01:06:20,537
雪瓶     你心中太多的仇恨
Do not carry vengeance in your heart, Snow

521
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:23,248
你让我忘掉过去
You tell me to let go of my past.

522
01:06:24,791 --> 01:06:28,879
独狼一直在你身边       你也同样什么都没做
Silent Wolf waits for you and yet you do nothing.

523
01:06:31,172 --> 01:06:33,800
你也没什么勇气面对
So much for your legendary courage.

524
01:06:33,884 --> 01:06:35,468
我的人生不会再变了
My path is set.

525
01:06:35,552 --> 01:06:37,178
你还年轻
You are still young.

526
01:06:37,262 --> 01:06:38,889
你可以
Yours is not.

527
01:06:40,807 --> 01:06:42,893
我知道我该做什么
I know what I must do.

528
01:07:09,711 --> 01:07:12,213
史银镖
Silver Dart Shi.

529
01:07:12,297 --> 01:07:14,841
她比我们更有勇气
She had more courage than any one of us.

530
01:07:21,473 --> 01:07:23,475
马贵
Turtle Ma.

531
01:07:23,558 --> 01:07:27,729
我从没想到我会这么说       我会想你的
I never thought I'd be saying this, but I'm going to miss him.

532
01:07:31,107 --> 01:07:33,026
多倒一点
Pour him a double.

533
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:47,415
你知道吗       在四川截镖的时候
You know, at the Battle of Sichuan,

534
01:07:47,499 --> 01:07:50,251
我也袭击过
I did hire out to those raiders.

535
01:07:50,335 --> 01:07:53,129
但是我做的是劫富济贫
But only because I thought that they were doing the right thing.

536
01:07:54,589 --> 01:07:55,507
我明白
I know that.

537
01:07:58,593 --> 01:07:59,928
我心里清楚
Always did.

538
01:08:00,012 --> 01:08:03,389
而你是押镖的
And you hired out to that gold convoy for the same reason.

539
01:08:04,808 --> 01:08:06,559
侠义之道
The Iron Way...

540
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:09,896
我们一直因它而活
some of us never stop living by it.

541
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:12,816
甚至也会因它而死
Even if it meant dying by it.

542
01:08:14,943 --> 01:08:18,321
我来这是为了祭奠铁贝勒
I came here to pay my respects to Sir Te.

543
01:08:25,495 --> 01:08:27,205
而现在...
And now...

544
01:08:28,581 --> 01:08:30,000
也为他儿子感到哀痛
I mourn for his son.

545
01:08:32,669 --> 01:08:36,965
今夜...       我要带剑离开
Tonight... I leave with the sword.

546
01:08:41,302 --> 01:08:42,345
独狼那？
And Silent Wolf?

547
01:08:44,014 --> 01:08:45,390
你会告诉他吗？
Will you speak with him?

548
01:08:49,227 --> 01:08:50,812
我会守住这把剑的
I'll guard the sword.

549
01:09:05,869 --> 01:09:08,204
你背叛了戴阎王
You betrayed Hades Dai, boy.

550
01:09:08,955 --> 01:09:11,083
她值得你这么做吗？
Is she worth your life?

551
01:09:11,833 --> 01:09:13,710
你的师傅吗
And that of your teacher?

552
01:09:14,627 --> 01:09:18,924
把剑带给戴阎王，否则你师傅铁乌鸦死路一条
Bring Hades Dai the sword or your Master, Iron Crow, dies.

553
01:09:20,258 --> 01:09:23,970
现在他已经去找你了，把剑带回来
Even now, he rides to meet you and secure the sword.

554
01:09:51,414 --> 01:09:53,249
我一定要带着剑走       你知道的
I cannot leave without the sword.You know this.

555
01:09:53,332 --> 01:09:54,694
如果带剑走的话       你会被杀死的
You will be killed if you take it.

556
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:55,794
如果我不带剑走的话也会被杀死
- I will be killed if I don't.

557
01:09:55,877 --> 01:09:57,921
那就走的远远的
Then go!

558
01:09:58,004 --> 01:10:01,299
离西莲派越远越好
Far from here,far from West Lotus Temple.

559
01:10:03,217 --> 01:10:04,970
我遵守了对你母亲承诺

好

562
01:10:58,272 --> 01:10:59,565
我看丢他了
I never saw him.

563
01:11:02,986 --> 01:11:07,157
一个人打了我       然后我就没知觉了
Felt a hand on my arm,then I could not move.

564
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:08,083

565

那人偷走了它

568
01:11:57,916 --> 01:12:00,793
不止我一个人的命

走     活着把剑带走

撑住

You made your choice all those years ago.Now I will make my choice.

来匡扶侠义之道       尽管会因其而死
To live the Iron Way,may be to die for it.

580
01:16:52,293 --> 01:16:55,171
我会与你奋战到底
I would rather face an army by your side...

581
01:16:56,881 --> 01:16:59,258
共赴黄泉

582
01:18:28,973 --> 01:18:31,434
你的预言是对的

583
01:18:34,270 --> 01:18:36,730
你师傅会为你感到骄傲

584
01:18:41,277 --> 01:18:43,488
我母亲也是
And my mother as well.

585
01:20:19,667 --> 01:20:24,088
一个曾经被我杀死的人竟然回来挑战我？
How does a man I once killed return to challenge me?

586
01:22:01,602 --> 01:22:04,730
和我一起在黑暗里吧       秀莲
Come with me into the dark,Xiu Lien.

587

我们会送你归西

589

我们尚未握着这把剑

590
01:26:34,959 --> 01:26:38,087
这把剑却已握着我们

591

我不能失去你

614
