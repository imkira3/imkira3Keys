2
00:01:12,542 --> 00:01:14,710
I'm real sorry about Dorothy, Walt.

3
00:01:15,378 --> 00:01:17,463
She was a real peach.

4
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:18,881
Thanks for coming, Al.

5
00:01:27,348 --> 00:01:29,224
Father, Son, Holy Spirit.

6
00:01:32,103 --> 00:01:35,064
Father. Spirit.

7
00:01:39,986 --> 00:01:41,403
Uh.

8
00:01:41,571 --> 00:01:43,155
Holy Spirit.

9
00:01:43,323 --> 00:01:45,115
It's okay, I can move down.

10
00:01:48,536 --> 00:01:50,871
Spectacles, testicles, wallet, and watch.

11
00:01:58,922 --> 00:02:02,091
Look at the way the old man
glared at Ashley.

12
00:02:02,258 --> 00:02:05,177
Can't even tone it down
for Mom's funeral.

13
00:02:05,887 --> 00:02:08,972
What do you expect?
Dad's still living in the '50s.

14
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,934
He expects his granddaughter
to dress a little more modestly.

15
00:02:12,102 --> 00:02:15,437
Well, your kid's wearing a Lions jersey.
I'm sure Dad appreciates that.

16
00:02:15,605 --> 00:02:19,650
The point is that there's nothing anyone
can do that won't disappoint the old man.

17
00:02:19,818 --> 00:02:22,027
It's inevitable.

18
00:02:24,823 --> 00:02:27,199
You know, that's why we stopped
doing Thanksgivings.

19
00:02:27,367 --> 00:02:32,579
You know, that deal with the boat motor,
the broken birdbath. It's always something.

20
00:02:32,747 --> 00:02:34,164
What are we gonna do with him?

21
00:02:34,332 --> 00:02:38,627
Don't you think he's gonna get in trouble,
all by himself in the old neighborhood?

22
00:02:40,713 --> 00:02:43,507
Well, why don't you have him
move in with you?

23
00:02:44,968 --> 00:02:46,343
Ha, ha, ha.

24
00:02:46,511 --> 00:02:48,428
Hey. Shh.

25
00:03:05,905 --> 00:03:10,868
Death is often a bittersweet occasion
to us Catholics.

26
00:03:11,244 --> 00:03:16,415
Bitter in the pain, sweet in the salvation.

27
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:22,713
Bitter in the pain it causes the deceased
and their families.

28
00:03:23,256 --> 00:03:28,760
Sweet to those of us
who know the salvation that awaits.

29
00:03:29,262 --> 00:03:32,681
And some may ask, "What is death?

30
00:03:33,266 --> 00:03:35,350
Is it the end?

31
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:37,769
Or is it the beginning?

32
00:03:38,771 --> 00:03:43,525
And what is life?
What is this thing we call life?"

33
00:03:45,153 --> 00:03:47,738
-All these questions can frustrate you.
Ashley, stop it.

34
00:03:48,531 --> 00:03:50,449
That's why you have to turn to the Lord.

35
00:03:50,617 --> 00:03:51,700
Jesus.

36
00:03:51,868 --> 00:03:54,369
Because the Lord is the sweetness....

37
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:01,960
- This is so good.
- Did you have a chance to call Martha?

38
00:04:10,678 --> 00:04:13,430
- Is that Dad?
- No. That's Grandpa Walt.

39
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:18,977
"Third platoon, E company,
March 2nd, 1 952, Korea"?

40
00:04:19,145 --> 00:04:20,938
Where's Korea?

41
00:04:24,651 --> 00:04:26,652
A lot of people showed up
after the service.

42
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:29,655
Well, I suppose they heard
there's gonna be a lot of ham.

43
00:04:29,822 --> 00:04:32,115
I'll go down in the basement
and get some chairs.

44
00:04:32,283 --> 00:04:35,327
-Oh, I can do that, Dad.
-No, I need them now, not next week.

45
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,751
Cool, I found a medal. Look at this.

46
00:05:05,108 --> 00:05:07,192
How much longer do we have to stay?

47
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,280
This ghetto is a dead zone for my cell,
and I'm bored.

48
00:05:11,447 --> 00:05:14,157
Ashley, why don't you go
help Grandpa Walt with the chairs?

49
00:05:14,325 --> 00:05:17,077
-Me?
-Yes, you. Go. Go help him.

50
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,873
Grandpa Walt,
would you like some help with this?

51
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,166
With your chairs?

52
00:05:23,334 --> 00:05:26,545
No. You probably just painted your nails.

53
00:05:29,173 --> 00:05:34,011
Honey, come here.
Okay, well, your dad is driving me crazy.

54
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,974
-Why did you make me do that?
It's okay. We're leaving soon.

55
00:05:39,142 --> 00:05:41,810
Hey, girl. Come on.

56
00:05:41,978 --> 00:05:45,397
Come on. Come on.

57
00:05:45,815 --> 00:05:47,774
Come with me.

58
00:06:12,258 --> 00:06:15,886
How many swamp rats can you get
in one room?

59
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:37,199
Wow. Grandpa, when did you
get the vintage car?

60
00:06:39,911 --> 00:06:42,454
1 972.

61
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,334
I never knew you had a cool old car.

62
00:06:47,502 --> 00:06:51,963
Yeah. Well, it's been here
since before you were born.

63
00:06:52,924 --> 00:06:54,633
So...

64
00:06:54,884 --> 00:07:00,389
...what are you gonna do with it
when you, like, die?

65
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,190
What about that super-cool
retro couch you have in the den?

66
00:07:10,358 --> 00:07:12,192
Because I'm going to state next year...

67
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,613
...and it would look really good in my room,
and I don't have any furniture at all.

68
00:07:23,287 --> 00:07:25,497
Oh, God.

69
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,461
-Who are you? What do you want?
-Hi.

70
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:33,505
-I live--
-Get the shit out of your mouth.

71
00:07:33,673 --> 00:07:36,007
-Tell me what you want.
-Do you have jumper cables?

72
00:07:36,175 --> 00:07:38,718
-My uncle's car is old and--
-We don't have any cables.

73
00:07:38,886 --> 00:07:42,013
And have some respect, zipperhead.
We're in mourning here.

74
00:07:44,517 --> 00:07:48,186
-How you holding up, Walt?
-Mr. Kowalski.

75
00:07:48,354 --> 00:07:49,813
Huh?

76
00:07:49,981 --> 00:07:52,023
Mr. Kowalski, that's my name.

77
00:07:53,025 --> 00:07:55,485
Right. Mr. Kowalski.

78
00:07:55,653 --> 00:07:58,321
Your wife and I became quite close
these last few months.

79
00:07:58,489 --> 00:08:01,324
She asked that I watch over you
when she passed on.

80
00:08:01,492 --> 00:08:03,160
I told her I watch over my flock.

81
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:06,037
But she made me promise I'd keep
an extra-sharp eye on you.

82
00:08:06,205 --> 00:08:08,832
Look, I appreciate the kindness
you've shown to my wife.

83
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,667
Now that you've spoken your piece...

84
00:08:10,835 --> 00:08:13,545
...why don't you go tend
to some of your other sheep?

85
00:08:14,213 --> 00:08:15,213
Okay?

86
00:08:15,381 --> 00:08:19,968
Dorothy mentioned specifically that it was
her desire for you to go to confession.

87
00:08:20,136 --> 00:08:22,637
She said she couldn't remember
the last time you went.

88
00:08:22,805 --> 00:08:25,223
-Is that so?
-It is.

89
00:08:26,225 --> 00:08:29,519
Well, I confess that I never really
cared for church very much.

90
00:08:29,687 --> 00:08:31,730
The only reason I went
was because of her.

91
00:08:31,898 --> 00:08:33,732
And I confess that I have no desire...

92
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:37,068
...to confess to a boy
that's just out of the seminary.

93
00:08:56,589 --> 00:08:58,048
Great to see you.

94
00:09:02,428 --> 00:09:03,637
-Bye, dear.
-So long, Walt.

95
00:09:03,804 --> 00:09:07,265
- Walt, can you get it started?
- Yeah, it'll be fine.

96
00:09:10,561 --> 00:09:14,064
I wish I could help, Dad,
but I gotta get the kids home.

97
00:09:14,607 --> 00:09:17,734
-Kids are getting restless.
-Yeah, fine. Just go.

98
00:09:17,902 --> 00:09:19,611
I'll call you,
see how you're doing.

99
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:20,862
All right.

100
00:09:25,284 --> 00:09:29,621
Kill you to buy American? Jesus.

101
00:09:30,248 --> 00:09:32,499
Did you see the way
he looked at the truck?

102
00:09:32,667 --> 00:09:35,252
It's always rice-burner this,
Jap-burner that, you know?

103
00:09:35,419 --> 00:09:38,547
-Even at Mom's funeral, he can't let it go.
-He didn't say anything.

104
00:09:38,714 --> 00:09:40,549
-He didn't need to.
-What do you expect?

105
00:09:40,716 --> 00:09:42,592
The man worked at Ford
all those years.

106
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,221
-I suppose that's my goddamn fault.
-Just give it a rest, just drive, okay?

107
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:50,642
Kids, want the radio on?
Anyone wanna listen to some music? Good.

108
00:10:05,992 --> 00:10:08,577
Damn barbarians.

109
00:10:11,497 --> 00:10:13,582
I'm just so brokenhearted.

110
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,544
I want my daughter
to find another husband.

111
00:10:18,254 --> 00:10:21,047
If she married again
there would be a man in the house.

112
00:10:22,091 --> 00:10:24,718
What about Thao?
The man of the house is right there.

113
00:10:25,595 --> 00:10:29,180
Look at him washing dishes.

114
00:10:29,807 --> 00:10:33,435
He does whatever his sister
orders him to do.

115
00:10:33,894 --> 00:10:36,354
How could he ever become the man
of the house?

116
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,026
Be patient, once he's older,
he will be the man of the house.

117
00:10:41,193 --> 00:10:42,485
No way.

118
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:53,955
Today is a blessed day, for a child is born.

119
00:10:56,792 --> 00:10:59,753
I offer food to nurture this child's body.

120
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:03,048
I offer clothing
to protect this child's flesh.

121
00:11:05,051 --> 00:11:08,261
The child is blessed with a mother
and father.

122
00:11:09,388 --> 00:11:11,306
Oh, spirit of this child...

123
00:11:11,557 --> 00:11:14,893
...return home
and do not wander anymore.

124
00:11:24,612 --> 00:11:27,572
Come home, spirit and soul, come home.

125
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,039
Live a good life and grow old.

126
00:11:48,427 --> 00:11:53,390
Jesus. Polarski would roll over in his grave
if he could see his lawn now.

127
00:11:54,934 --> 00:11:59,270
What the hell did Chinks have to
move into this neighborhood for?

128
00:12:01,565 --> 00:12:04,275
Why does that old white man stay here?

129
00:12:06,028 --> 00:12:08,988
All the Americans have moved out
of this neighborhood.

130
00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:11,282
Why haven't you gone?

131
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:15,203
Why don't you strut away,
you dumb rooster?

132
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,259
Are you gone completely deaf
or something?

133
00:12:31,011 --> 00:12:32,804
Hi there, Walt.

134
00:12:33,764 --> 00:12:36,933
I'm not a friend of yours,
so why do you insist on calling me Walt?

135
00:12:37,435 --> 00:12:39,644
Sorry. Mr. Kowalski.

136
00:12:39,812 --> 00:12:44,816
-What are you peddling today, Padre?
-Nothing. I thought I'd drop by and see you.

137
00:12:44,984 --> 00:12:46,359
I haven't seen you in church.

138
00:12:46,527 --> 00:12:49,988
Now that you've done your good deed,
why don't you take off down the road?

139
00:12:50,156 --> 00:12:53,992
-I'd really like to talk, Mr. Kowalski.
-Not in this lifetime, sonny.

140
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,619
Why? Do you have a problem with me,
Mr. Kowalski?

141
00:12:56,787 --> 00:12:58,997
-You don't wanna know.
-No, I do.

142
00:12:59,957 --> 00:13:03,501
Well, I think you're an over-educated
27-year-old virgin...

143
00:13:03,669 --> 00:13:09,174
...who likes to hold hands of ladies who are
superstitious and promises them eternity.

144
00:13:23,522 --> 00:13:26,024
Yo! Hey!

145
00:13:26,192 --> 00:13:30,737
Is you--? Is you a boy or is you a girl, man?
I can't tell.

146
00:13:30,905 --> 00:13:33,114
Hey, chinito, hey,
if you was in the pen...

147
00:13:33,282 --> 00:13:35,700
...I'd be fucking you in the ass.
You'd be my bitch.

148
00:13:35,868 --> 00:13:38,119
What are you reading,
Jackass and the Rice Stalk?

149
00:13:38,287 --> 00:13:41,372
Yeah, that's right, keep walking!
Keep walking!

150
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,291
Look at me when I talk to you, homes!

151
00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:45,877
Fucking slopes, man,
everywhere you look, man.

152
00:13:46,045 --> 00:13:48,838
- Slopes everywhere we go, man.
- Go back to your rice paddy.

153
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,966
What you looking at, man?

154
00:13:58,307 --> 00:14:01,559
-That's my little cousin over there.
-You sure that's your cousin, man?

155
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:04,604
-Fuck, yeah, that's my little cousin.
-He tight with anybody?

156
00:14:04,772 --> 00:14:07,065
No, he flies solo, man.
You wanna do something?

157
00:14:07,233 --> 00:14:10,443
Man, let's go down there and see
what the fuck they doing over there.

158
00:14:16,909 --> 00:14:18,868
I like your sandals too.

159
00:14:19,495 --> 00:14:23,039
-Hey. Yo, what's up? What's up?
-Yo, what's up, motherfuckers?

160
00:14:23,207 --> 00:14:26,000
They fucking with you?
Man, fuck you, homeboy!

161
00:14:26,168 --> 00:14:29,337
-What you got?
Hey, we can do this right now.

162
00:14:29,505 --> 00:14:32,173
-You go fucking back to your country.
-Fuck you, man.

163
00:14:32,341 --> 00:14:34,717
Oh, good, more fucking rice niggers.

164
00:14:34,885 --> 00:14:37,262
Aren't you supposed to cook me
some Chinese food, huh?

165
00:14:40,641 --> 00:14:44,853
-How many bullets you got?
-We'll catch you on the rebound, homey.

166
00:14:50,818 --> 00:14:53,278
- Thao!
- Come on, man. Get in the car, man.

167
00:14:53,445 --> 00:14:55,154
Thao.

168
00:14:55,322 --> 00:14:56,948
-Get with us, man.
-Get in the car.

169
00:14:57,116 --> 00:14:59,784
- Fuck, man, get in the car, man.
- Thao!

170
00:14:59,952 --> 00:15:01,160
Those punk-ass Mexicans
messing with you?

171
00:15:01,328 --> 00:15:05,331
Dog, we just bailed your ass out, dog.
Come on, dog, get the fuck in here.

172
00:15:05,499 --> 00:15:08,793
- What you doing, man?
- Get in the car, man, come on.

173
00:15:08,961 --> 00:15:11,045
Chill with us, man.

174
00:15:11,338 --> 00:15:14,340
Come on, man.
We just bailed your ass out, dog!

175
00:15:14,633 --> 00:15:16,259
Come on.

176
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:23,016
Come on, Thao, man. You need a big coz
to take care of you, man.

177
00:15:23,183 --> 00:15:24,517
Man, fuck it. Hey.

178
00:15:24,685 --> 00:15:27,020
Forget it, man. Let's go, dude.
Fuck his ass.

179
00:15:27,187 --> 00:15:30,064
-Tomorrow, I'll see your ass.
Why you gotta be a little girl?

180
00:15:30,232 --> 00:15:31,274
Tomorrow.

181
00:15:31,442 --> 00:15:33,526
Come on, man, let's go.
We got the gun, man.

182
00:15:33,694 --> 00:15:35,737
- Fuck you.
- Let's get the fuck out of here.

183
00:15:35,905 --> 00:15:38,531
-We've got the strap.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

184
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:40,825
-Fuck that pussy.
Pussy.

185
00:15:51,003 --> 00:15:52,837
Hey, Thao.

186
00:15:57,259 --> 00:15:58,760
Hey, what's up?

187
00:16:00,012 --> 00:16:02,180
What's up, Thao?

188
00:16:04,183 --> 00:16:06,309
What are you doing, little man?

189
00:16:06,477 --> 00:16:09,979
-Why you doing women's work?
-What do you want?

190
00:16:11,148 --> 00:16:13,608
What? I can't just come
and talk to my little cousin?

191
00:16:15,486 --> 00:16:18,905
-He doesn't wanna talk to you.
-Well, I'm here, right?

192
00:16:19,073 --> 00:16:21,157
- Hey, Spider, who that?
- What's up?

193
00:16:21,325 --> 00:16:24,535
Spider? Is that what
he just called you, Fong?

194
00:16:25,204 --> 00:16:26,871
Spider.

195
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:30,833
-Is there something wrong with Spider?
-What are you doing here?

196
00:16:31,377 --> 00:16:33,211
Hey, so how old is you anyways?

197
00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:36,464
-Mentally, I'm way too old for you.
-What?

198
00:16:37,049 --> 00:16:39,133
You guys are stupid. I'm going inside.

199
00:16:39,301 --> 00:16:41,010
-What?
-Sue.

200
00:16:42,721 --> 00:16:45,223
Help your little bro do this gardening.

201
00:16:45,391 --> 00:16:47,475
Bite it, stupid.

202
00:16:48,894 --> 00:16:51,229
Hey. You wanna roll with us, man?
Come on.

203
00:16:51,397 --> 00:16:53,773
-Dude.
-Come on, ride with us. Come on.

204
00:16:53,941 --> 00:16:55,358
Come on, chill with us.

205
00:16:55,526 --> 00:16:58,611
You need somebody to protect you.
That's what your big coz is for.

206
00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:01,239
Look, dog, I been there, done it,
and I seen it, man.

207
00:17:01,407 --> 00:17:03,783
Back in the day, everybody used to
wanna beat me up.

208
00:17:03,951 --> 00:17:05,576
But now, nobody wanna fuck with me.

209
00:17:05,744 --> 00:17:08,204
-Come on, man, let's go.
-We're coz, right?

210
00:17:08,372 --> 00:17:12,125
Come on.
-We're coz, right? We're family.

211
00:17:12,292 --> 00:17:16,421
Look, a brother to Spider
is a brother to me. Come on.

212
00:17:16,588 --> 00:17:18,464
Dude, man, take this shit off.
Come on.

213
00:17:18,632 --> 00:17:21,551
- Come on, roll with us. Come on.
- That's woman's work, man.

214
00:17:21,719 --> 00:17:23,261
Don't get your hands dirty, man.

215
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:28,433
So, what do I have to do?

216
00:17:30,102 --> 00:17:33,187
Spider told me that our boy next door
got a bad-ass whip.

217
00:17:37,609 --> 00:17:38,776
Come on.

218
00:17:40,154 --> 00:17:41,195
Nice.

219
00:17:41,363 --> 00:17:44,657
Yeah, my little cousin being a little man.

220
00:17:48,871 --> 00:17:50,830
Whoa.

221
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,251
Yo, now, that's a nice car.

222
00:17:55,419 --> 00:17:59,297
Hell, yeah. 1972 Gran Torino, fastback.

223
00:17:59,465 --> 00:18:01,340
-Yo.
-Cobra jet engine.

224
00:18:01,508 --> 00:18:03,509
Yo, man, it's still in mint condition.

225
00:18:03,677 --> 00:18:08,222
Yo, man. It's in mint condition, man.

226
00:18:10,392 --> 00:18:11,726
Oh, I've got one.

227
00:18:11,894 --> 00:18:15,271
There's a Mexican, a Jew,
and a colored guy go into a bar.

228
00:18:15,439 --> 00:18:19,525
The bartender looks up and says,
"Get the fuck out of here."

229
00:18:20,569 --> 00:18:23,863
So here's where my flock congregates
when they're not in church.

230
00:18:24,031 --> 00:18:25,073
Hey, Father J.

231
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,699
Hi, Mel. Hey there, Darrell.

232
00:18:26,867 --> 00:18:29,077
-Hello, Father.
-Hi, Walt.

233
00:18:30,245 --> 00:18:32,747
What brings you in here, Father?
The meat raffle?

234
00:18:34,374 --> 00:18:37,835
No, I just came down to talk to Walt,
if that's okay.

235
00:18:39,505 --> 00:18:43,591
Damn, Padre, you are persistent,
aren't you?

236
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:45,676
I promised your wife.

237
00:18:46,386 --> 00:18:49,263
All right. Let's get a booth.

238
00:18:52,643 --> 00:18:56,813
I'll have a Pabst and a shot of Jack
and whatever he's having.

239
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:00,483
-I'll have a Diet Coke.
-Bullshit, this is a bar. You have a drink.

240
00:19:00,651 --> 00:19:04,779
-Um, I'll have a gin and tonic.
Attaboy.

241
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:07,698
So...

242
00:19:08,325 --> 00:19:09,867
...what do you want?

243
00:19:10,035 --> 00:19:12,870
I promised your wife I'd get you
to go to confession.

244
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:14,664
Now, why would you do that?

245
00:19:14,832 --> 00:19:18,167
She was very insistent. She made me.

246
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:22,255
You're kind of fond of promising things
you can't deliver on. Right, Father?

247
00:19:22,422 --> 00:19:24,757
-Let's talk about something else.
-What?

248
00:19:24,925 --> 00:19:26,467
Life and death.

249
00:19:27,302 --> 00:19:31,681
Life and death. What the hell do you know
about life and death?

250
00:19:32,266 --> 00:19:35,518
I'd like to think I know a lot. I'm a priest.

251
00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:38,688
Yeah. You get up and preach about life
and death...

252
00:19:38,856 --> 00:19:41,649
...but all you know is what you learned
in priest school.

253
00:19:41,817 --> 00:19:44,944
Right out of the rookie
preacher's handbook.

254
00:19:45,112 --> 00:19:47,071
I don't know about that. I think--

255
00:19:47,239 --> 00:19:49,115
Death is bittersweet.

256
00:19:49,283 --> 00:19:52,869
Sort of bitter in its pain,
but sweet in its salvation.

257
00:19:53,787 --> 00:19:57,540
That's what you know about life and death,
and it's pathetic.

258
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,167
What do you know, Mr. Kowalski?

259
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:04,172
I know a lot. I lived for almost three years
in Korea with it.

260
00:20:04,339 --> 00:20:06,048
Thanks.

261
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:08,384
We shot men...

262
00:20:08,552 --> 00:20:14,932
...stabbed them with bayonets,
hacked 1 7-year-olds to death with shovels.

263
00:20:15,851 --> 00:20:18,769
Stuff I'll remember till the day I die.

264
00:20:18,937 --> 00:20:23,691
Horrible things, but things I'll live with.

265
00:20:23,859 --> 00:20:25,735
And what about life?

266
00:20:30,449 --> 00:20:35,119
Well, I survived the war.

267
00:20:37,748 --> 00:20:39,373
Got married, had a family.

268
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,712
Sounds like you know a lot more
about death than you do living.

269
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:53,304
Maybe so, Father.

270
00:20:53,805 --> 00:20:55,556
Maybe so.

271
00:21:05,192 --> 00:21:07,693
Son of a bitch.

272
00:22:01,873 --> 00:22:04,375
Come on, get in the car!
Thao, what the fuck? Get in!

273
00:22:04,543 --> 00:22:06,460
-Get in, Thao.
-Come on, let's go. Get in.

274
00:22:06,628 --> 00:22:08,004
Fuck, man? Get in!

275
00:22:29,693 --> 00:22:31,444
-Hello?
-Hey. Morning, Dad.

276
00:22:31,611 --> 00:22:33,321
It's your number one son, Mitch.

277
00:22:33,488 --> 00:22:37,241
Morning? It's after 1 in the afternoon,
it's not morning.

278
00:22:37,409 --> 00:22:40,995
Oh, right. Afternoon, then.

279
00:22:41,872 --> 00:22:43,873
So, what do you want?

280
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:48,753
What? No. Nothing.
I mean, what would I want?

281
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,962
Well, I don't know.

282
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:53,049
Your wife's already gone through
all your mother's jewelry.

283
00:22:54,926 --> 00:22:58,346
No, Dad, I'm just calling
to see how you're doing. Just....

284
00:22:58,513 --> 00:23:01,098
Anything new
with the old neighborhood?

285
00:23:01,266 --> 00:23:03,225
Yeah. No.

286
00:23:03,393 --> 00:23:05,353
Great. Smooth sailing.

287
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,562
Yeah.

288
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:11,734
-Okay, good. Good, then. Oh, hey, Dad.
-Yeah.

289
00:23:11,902 --> 00:23:17,406
You wouldn't happen to still know that guy
that has the Lions season tickets?

290
00:23:18,075 --> 00:23:21,285
Oh, you fuck.

291
00:23:21,453 --> 00:23:23,120
Dad--

292
00:23:54,444 --> 00:23:56,987
Ain't she sweet.

293
00:24:13,296 --> 00:24:15,089
Come on, girl.

294
00:24:30,063 --> 00:24:33,315
Yo, what's up? What are you guys
doing out here, man?

295
00:24:33,483 --> 00:24:36,360
- Nothing.
- Minding our own business.

296
00:24:36,528 --> 00:24:38,112
Just hanging out.

297
00:24:38,947 --> 00:24:40,698
What are you guys doing here?

298
00:24:41,908 --> 00:24:43,534
-What?
I told you guys already--

299
00:24:43,702 --> 00:24:46,537
Can't I just come hang out
with my little cousin?

300
00:24:46,705 --> 00:24:47,997
Huh?

301
00:24:51,251 --> 00:24:52,710
We have good news for you, man.

302
00:24:52,878 --> 00:24:55,045
Oh, really? And what's that?

303
00:24:55,213 --> 00:24:56,464
Only for guy talk.

304
00:24:56,631 --> 00:24:58,924
-I don't think so.
-Why not?

305
00:24:59,092 --> 00:25:01,385
Come on, man.
We gonna give you another shot, man.

306
00:25:01,761 --> 00:25:04,054
-Don't go, Thao.
Mind your own business, girl.

307
00:25:04,222 --> 00:25:06,891
-Come on, let's go.
Come.

308
00:25:07,851 --> 00:25:10,227
-Yeah, what are you gonna do, huh?
Come on, dog.

309
00:25:34,169 --> 00:25:35,920
Look. You've broken Daddy's gnome.

310
00:25:38,381 --> 00:25:41,175
What the hell is this?

311
00:25:42,886 --> 00:25:46,430
Get up.
-Get off my lawn.

312
00:25:48,934 --> 00:25:51,060
Listen, old man,
you don't wanna fuck with me.

313
00:25:51,228 --> 00:25:54,063
Did you hear me?
I said, get off my lawn now.

314
00:25:54,231 --> 00:25:56,232
Are you fucking crazy?
Go back in the house.

315
00:25:56,399 --> 00:25:59,902
Yeah. I blow a hole in your face,
and then I go in the house.

316
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:03,113
And I sleep like a baby.
You can count on that.

317
00:26:03,281 --> 00:26:06,283
We used to stack fucks like you
five feet high in Korea...

318
00:26:06,451 --> 00:26:08,536
...use you for sandbags.

319
00:26:12,999 --> 00:26:14,083
Okay.

320
00:26:15,752 --> 00:26:19,129
-But you better watch your back.
-Fuck it, man, he's crazy.

321
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,263
We'll get this cracker next time.

322
00:26:31,726 --> 00:26:33,143
Thank you.

323
00:26:34,646 --> 00:26:37,064
Get off my lawn.

324
00:27:10,849 --> 00:27:12,683
What the hell is this?

325
00:27:21,943 --> 00:27:23,193
Christ.

326
00:27:23,903 --> 00:27:27,615
No, no. No, no, no.
Come on, no more. No more.

327
00:27:27,782 --> 00:27:29,658
No more. What--?

328
00:27:31,953 --> 00:27:34,872
Stay right there. Stay right there.

329
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,624
Why can't you just leave me alone?

330
00:27:36,791 --> 00:27:38,542
We brought you some shallots
to plant.

331
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,544
-I don't want them.
-They're perennials.

332
00:27:40,712 --> 00:27:43,964
-They come back every year.
-Why are you bringing me all this garbage?

333
00:27:44,132 --> 00:27:45,799
Because....

334
00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:49,637
-Because you saved Thao.
-I didn't save anybody.

335
00:27:49,804 --> 00:27:53,307
I just-- I kept a bunch of jabbering gooks
off of my lawn, that's all.

336
00:27:53,475 --> 00:27:55,517
-You're a hero to the neighborhood.
-I'm not a hero.

337
00:27:55,685 --> 00:27:58,395
They think you are.
That's why they keep bringing you gifts.

338
00:27:58,563 --> 00:28:00,064
-Please, take them.
-They're wrong.

339
00:28:00,231 --> 00:28:02,024
Now, I just want to be left alone.
Thank you.

340
00:28:03,401 --> 00:28:04,443
Wait.

341
00:28:06,446 --> 00:28:09,740
This is my mom, Vu, I'm Sue,
and that's my brother, Thao.

342
00:28:09,908 --> 00:28:12,409
-We live next door.
-So?

343
00:28:12,577 --> 00:28:14,912
Thao wants to say something.

344
00:28:17,415 --> 00:28:18,874
I'm sorry.

345
00:28:19,042 --> 00:28:23,545
-Sorry for what?
-For trying to steal your car.

346
00:28:25,256 --> 00:28:27,424
Let me tell you something, boy.

347
00:28:27,592 --> 00:28:31,887
You step on this property again,
you're done.

348
00:28:54,536 --> 00:28:56,495
Good afternoon, Walt.

349
00:28:57,247 --> 00:28:59,790
I told you I'm not going to confession.

350
00:28:59,958 --> 00:29:03,460
-Why didn't you just call the police?
-What?

351
00:29:03,628 --> 00:29:05,462
I do work
with some of the Hmong gangs...

352
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:08,090
...and I heard there was trouble
in the neighborhood.

353
00:29:08,258 --> 00:29:10,300
Why didn't you call the police?

354
00:29:11,302 --> 00:29:12,928
Well....

355
00:29:14,305 --> 00:29:17,975
You know, I prayed
that they would show up...

356
00:29:18,143 --> 00:29:20,936
...but nobody answered.

357
00:29:21,104 --> 00:29:22,688
What were you thinking?

358
00:29:22,856 --> 00:29:26,233
Someone could have been killed.
We're talking life and death here.

359
00:29:26,776 --> 00:29:29,987
When things go wrong,
you gotta act quickly.

360
00:29:30,155 --> 00:29:34,116
When we were in Korea and a thousand
screaming gooks came across our line...

361
00:29:34,284 --> 00:29:36,160
...we didn't call the police, we reacted.

362
00:29:36,327 --> 00:29:38,996
We're not in Korea, Mr. Kowalski.

363
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:43,709
I've been thinking about our conversation
on life and death.

364
00:29:43,877 --> 00:29:45,669
About what you said.

365
00:29:45,837 --> 00:29:49,465
About how you carry around all the horrible
things you were forced to do...

366
00:29:49,632 --> 00:29:51,800
...horrible things that won't leave you.

367
00:29:52,802 --> 00:29:57,431
It seems it would do you good
to unload some of that burden.

368
00:29:57,807 --> 00:30:00,517
Things done during war are terrible.

369
00:30:00,977 --> 00:30:02,644
Being ordered to kill.

370
00:30:02,812 --> 00:30:05,689
Killing to save yourself,
killing to save others.

371
00:30:05,857 --> 00:30:10,235
You're right. Those are things
I know nothing about...

372
00:30:10,403 --> 00:30:12,946
...but I do know about forgiveness...

373
00:30:13,114 --> 00:30:16,450
...and I've seen a lot of men
who have confessed their sins...

374
00:30:16,618 --> 00:30:20,871
...admitted their guilt,
and left their burdens behind them.

375
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:23,373
Stronger men than you.

376
00:30:23,541 --> 00:30:26,418
Men at war who were ordered
to do appalling things...

377
00:30:26,586 --> 00:30:29,046
...and are now at peace.

378
00:30:29,589 --> 00:30:31,757
Well, I gotta hand it to you, Padre.

379
00:30:31,925 --> 00:30:34,051
You came here
with your guns loaded this time.

380
00:30:34,886 --> 00:30:36,220
Thank you.

381
00:30:36,387 --> 00:30:38,472
And you're right about one thing.

382
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,309
About stronger men than me
reaching their salvation.

383
00:30:42,477 --> 00:30:45,562
Well, halle-fucking-lujah.

384
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:48,565
But you're wrong about something else.

385
00:30:48,733 --> 00:30:51,109
What's that, Mr. Kowalski?

386
00:30:51,444 --> 00:30:56,907
The thing that haunts a man the most
is what he isn't ordered to do.

387
00:31:01,746 --> 00:31:04,957
There. You finally look
like a human being again.

388
00:31:05,124 --> 00:31:08,418
You shouldn't wait so long between
haircuts, you cheap son of a bitch.

389
00:31:08,586 --> 00:31:11,672
Yeah. Well, I'm surprised
you're still around.

390
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,298
I was always hoping you'd die...

391
00:31:13,466 --> 00:31:16,093
...and they'd get somebody
who knew what they were doing.

392
00:31:16,261 --> 00:31:19,596
Instead you just keep hanging around
like the doo-wop dago you are.

393
00:31:19,764 --> 00:31:23,892
-That'll be 10 bucks, Walt.
-Ten bucks? Jesus Christ, Martin.

394
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:27,104
What are you, half Jew or something?
You keep raising the prices.

395
00:31:27,272 --> 00:31:31,441
It's been 10 bucks for the last five years,
you hard-nosed, Polack son of a bitch.

396
00:31:31,609 --> 00:31:35,612
-Yeah, well, keep the change.
-See you in three weeks, prick.

397
00:31:36,281 --> 00:31:38,115
Not if I see you first, dipshit.

398
00:31:41,911 --> 00:31:44,538
Since everything could go downhill
after that.

399
00:31:44,706 --> 00:31:46,456
-Yeah, that's true.
-That would suck.

400
00:31:48,126 --> 00:31:51,628
-That's cool, you know? Yeah.
Ain't shit going on, man.

401
00:31:53,673 --> 00:31:55,257
Ain't shit going on.

402
00:31:56,175 --> 00:31:58,552
Man, look at this. Look at this, Monk.
Check this out.

403
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,804
- Oooh. Boy.
- Oh, yeah.

404
00:32:01,472 --> 00:32:04,933
Bring that little tight ass over here.
Come here, girl. Don't be shy.

405
00:32:05,101 --> 00:32:09,313
What, you can't say hi?
Why you acting all stuck-up and shit?

406
00:32:10,815 --> 00:32:14,484
-What you supposed to be, man?
-Yo, it's cool, dog.

407
00:32:15,445 --> 00:32:17,654
What the fuck you doing
in my neighborhood, boy?

408
00:32:17,822 --> 00:32:21,366
Nothing. Just going down to Corner Spot,
you know? Get some CDs.

409
00:32:21,534 --> 00:32:22,576
It's all good, bro.

410
00:32:23,453 --> 00:32:24,786
See, he called you bro, Duke.

411
00:32:24,954 --> 00:32:27,122
-He called you bro, man.
-It's all good, bro.

412
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:29,041
- It's all good, huh?
- Shut the fuck up.

413
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:32,085
Call me bro again, man,
I'll bite your motherfucking face off.

414
00:32:32,253 --> 00:32:33,503
Yeah, motherfucker.

415
00:32:33,671 --> 00:32:35,839
Now, what the fuck
y'all come down here for?

416
00:32:36,007 --> 00:32:39,635
You here to bring me this little present?
Monk? She bringing it to us?

417
00:32:39,802 --> 00:32:41,470
This little Oriental yummy.

418
00:32:41,638 --> 00:32:43,972
Don't worry.
I'm gonna take real good care of her.

419
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:46,516
-Fuck out of here, man.
-Fuck out of here, man.

420
00:32:52,523 --> 00:32:54,816
-I told you we're finished here.
Oh, yeah.

421
00:32:54,984 --> 00:32:56,276
Keep your ass right here.

422
00:32:56,861 --> 00:33:00,280
Oh, great. Another asshole
who has a fetish for Asian girls?

423
00:33:00,448 --> 00:33:02,824
God, that gets so old.

424
00:33:02,992 --> 00:33:04,660
Oh, shit.
-What's your name, girl?

425
00:33:04,827 --> 00:33:06,662
My name?

426
00:33:06,829 --> 00:33:08,664
Get your ass out of here, okay?

427
00:33:08,831 --> 00:33:11,833
It's "Take your crude come-on
to every woman who walks past...

428
00:33:12,001 --> 00:33:14,127
...and cram it." That's my name.

429
00:33:14,754 --> 00:33:16,713
Mouthy little bitch.

430
00:33:16,881 --> 00:33:20,175
-Who you think you talking to?
-Who does it look like?

431
00:33:20,343 --> 00:33:23,762
-You think you real funny, don't you?
-Oh, shit. Ain't she tough?

432
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:27,724
What? You gonna hit me now? That would
pretty much complete the picture.

433
00:33:27,892 --> 00:33:29,726
You need to keep your bitch on a leash.

434
00:33:29,894 --> 00:33:32,562
Put a chain on that whore
and yank that motherfucker.

435
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:34,856
Of course. Right to the
stereotype thesaurus.

436
00:33:35,024 --> 00:33:37,401
Call me a whore and a bitch
in the same sentence.

437
00:33:37,568 --> 00:33:39,611
-This bitch is crazy.
I like them like that.

438
00:33:39,779 --> 00:33:40,904
Man, take this bitch.

439
00:33:41,072 --> 00:33:44,324
Hey. Get off me.

440
00:33:46,995 --> 00:33:50,205
-You don't know when to quit, do you?
I'm gonna teach her a lesson.

441
00:33:50,373 --> 00:33:52,416
Stop. Let go.

442
00:33:55,837 --> 00:33:57,921
Get your ass over there.

443
00:34:02,218 --> 00:34:04,094
What the fuck you looking at, old man?

444
00:34:05,304 --> 00:34:08,515
-What the hell are you spooks up to?
-Spooks?

445
00:34:09,142 --> 00:34:12,060
You better get your ass on, honky,
while I still let you.

446
00:34:12,228 --> 00:34:14,479
-That's what you better do.
-That's right, bitch.

447
00:34:14,981 --> 00:34:17,274
Fuck you think you at?

448
00:34:27,285 --> 00:34:30,287
Ever notice how you come across somebody
once in a while...

449
00:34:30,455 --> 00:34:32,289
...that you shouldn't have fucked with?

450
00:34:36,544 --> 00:34:37,961
That's me.

451
00:34:39,505 --> 00:34:41,798
Man, you fucking crazy, man.
Get out of here, man.

452
00:34:41,966 --> 00:34:45,886
Why don't you get your ass up out of here
before I kick your old, wrinkly, white ass?

453
00:34:47,013 --> 00:34:49,806
Crazy motherfucker, man.
What's wrong with him, man?

454
00:34:52,643 --> 00:34:54,936
What the fuck?

455
00:34:55,438 --> 00:34:58,482
-This motherfucker crazy, man.
-What's wrong with this nigga, man?

456
00:34:58,691 --> 00:35:00,192
What the hell?

457
00:35:01,235 --> 00:35:02,486
Get in the truck.

458
00:35:04,906 --> 00:35:07,532
This crazy motherfucker, man.
What's wrong with him, man?

459
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,493
He put his finger at us.

460
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,496
-Oh, shit.
-Come on, now. Hey, pops. Come on, now.

461
00:35:12,663 --> 00:35:15,082
Shut your fucking face.

462
00:35:16,375 --> 00:35:18,668
You fucking don't listen, do you?

463
00:35:19,212 --> 00:35:21,129
Now, get in the truck.

464
00:35:21,297 --> 00:35:24,382
-Go on, get in the truck now. Shit.
Way to go, old man.

465
00:35:25,009 --> 00:35:26,968
Shut up, pussy.

466
00:35:27,637 --> 00:35:30,806
What is all this "bro" shit, anyway?

467
00:35:30,973 --> 00:35:34,476
Want to be Super Spade or something?
These guys don't want to be your bro...

468
00:35:34,644 --> 00:35:38,355
...and I don't blame them. Now, get
your ofay, Paddy ass on down the road.

469
00:35:44,862 --> 00:35:46,863
Take care, now.

470
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,867
Yeah, you too.

471
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:57,124
Oh, yeah.

472
00:36:06,843 --> 00:36:09,094
Fuck, man, why y'all
didn't fucking do nothing?

473
00:36:09,262 --> 00:36:11,555
-Man, kick that nigga's ass.
-Man, you fucking--

474
00:36:11,722 --> 00:36:13,014
Shit, man.

475
00:36:13,182 --> 00:36:15,600
This fucker.
He had that cannon in your fucking face.

476
00:36:15,768 --> 00:36:17,894
-You didn't do nothing.
-Trying to stay out.

477
00:36:18,146 --> 00:36:20,647
What's the matter with you,
for chrissake?

478
00:36:21,566 --> 00:36:23,942
Trying to get yourself killed?

479
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:26,862
I thought you Asian girls
were supposed to be smart.

480
00:36:27,029 --> 00:36:30,866
Hanging around a neighborhood like that's
a fast way to get you in the obituaries.

481
00:36:31,033 --> 00:36:33,285
I know. I know. Take it easy.

482
00:36:33,452 --> 00:36:36,163
And what about that goofball guy
you were with?

483
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:38,748
Is that a date or something?

484
00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:42,085
Yeah. Kind of. His name is Trey.

485
00:36:42,253 --> 00:36:44,337
Well, you shouldn't be hanging out
with him.

486
00:36:44,505 --> 00:36:47,591
You should be hanging out with your
own people, with other Humongs.

487
00:36:47,758 --> 00:36:51,595
You mean Hmong?
We're Hmong, not "Humong."

488
00:36:51,762 --> 00:36:53,555
Whatever.

489
00:36:54,056 --> 00:36:57,642
Where the hell is Humong,
I mean Hmong, anyway?

490
00:36:59,604 --> 00:37:00,687
Wow.

491
00:37:00,855 --> 00:37:05,483
You're so enlightened, you know that?
No, Hmong isn't a place. It's a people.

492
00:37:05,651 --> 00:37:08,778
Hmong people come from different parts
of Laos, Thailand, and China.

493
00:37:08,946 --> 00:37:11,823
Yeah. Well, how did you end up
in my neighborhood, then?

494
00:37:11,991 --> 00:37:13,909
Why didn't you stay there?

495
00:37:14,619 --> 00:37:17,579
It's a Vietnam thing.
We fought on your side.

496
00:37:17,747 --> 00:37:21,499
And when the Americans quit, the
Communists started killing all the Hmong.

497
00:37:21,667 --> 00:37:23,460
So we came over here.

498
00:37:23,628 --> 00:37:27,380
Yeah. Well, I don't know
how you ended up in the Midwest.

499
00:37:27,548 --> 00:37:30,300
There's snow on the ground
six months out of the year.

500
00:37:30,468 --> 00:37:33,929
Why does a jungle people want to
be in the great frozen tundra?

501
00:37:34,096 --> 00:37:39,267
Hill people. We were hill people.
Not jungle people. Booga-booga-booga.

502
00:37:39,435 --> 00:37:41,853
Yeah. Whatever.

503
00:37:42,021 --> 00:37:44,564
Blame the Lutherans.
They brought us over here.

504
00:37:44,732 --> 00:37:46,858
Everybody blames the Lutherans.

505
00:37:48,319 --> 00:37:52,781
Well, you'd think the cold
would keep all the idiots out.

506
00:37:54,533 --> 00:37:56,826
Thanks for the ride.

507
00:37:57,078 --> 00:37:59,621
You know something, kid?
You're all right.

508
00:38:00,581 --> 00:38:02,582
But what about that dimwit brother
of yours?

509
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:06,711
-He a little slow or something?
-Thao is actually really smart.

510
00:38:06,879 --> 00:38:09,339
He just doesn't know
which direction to go in.

511
00:38:10,299 --> 00:38:14,052
-Yeah. Poor Toad.
-It's really common.

512
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,012
Hmong girls over here fit in better.

513
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:19,349
The girls go to college,
and the boys go to jail.

514
00:38:22,645 --> 00:38:24,187
Yeah.

515
00:38:33,698 --> 00:38:36,950
That old hag hates my ass.

516
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:40,412
Well....

517
00:38:45,751 --> 00:38:49,004
"Your birthday today." Daisy.

518
00:38:49,672 --> 00:38:53,883
"This year, you have to make a choice
between two life paths.

519
00:38:54,051 --> 00:38:55,969
Second chances come your way.

520
00:38:56,137 --> 00:39:01,224
Extraordinary events culminate
in what might seem to be an anticlimax.

521
00:39:01,392 --> 00:39:05,228
Your lucky numbers are 84, 23...

522
00:39:05,396 --> 00:39:10,066
... 11 , 78, and 99."

523
00:39:10,818 --> 00:39:13,194
What a load of shit.

524
00:39:15,072 --> 00:39:16,364
Yeah.

525
00:39:31,005 --> 00:39:34,090
What the hell is it with kids nowadays?

526
00:39:36,052 --> 00:39:37,427
All right.

527
00:39:37,595 --> 00:39:40,347
Hey, Mrs. V.
Here, let me help you with those.

528
00:39:40,514 --> 00:39:44,434
Oh, thank you. I just--
I got it.

529
00:39:45,936 --> 00:39:47,437
How about that?

530
00:39:48,022 --> 00:39:50,899
Here you go.
-How about that, Daisy?

531
00:39:58,574 --> 00:40:00,283
Yeah, I got it.

532
00:40:01,285 --> 00:40:03,078
MRS. V.
That was too heavy for the bag.

533
00:40:03,245 --> 00:40:04,788
No problem.
-Thank you.

534
00:40:14,131 --> 00:40:18,510
-Go ahead, Karen, give it to him.
-Here you go.

535
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:22,889
-Well, what is it?
-It's a Gopher.

536
00:40:23,516 --> 00:40:26,976
So you can reach stuff.
You know, it makes things a lot easier.

537
00:40:27,937 --> 00:40:29,979
This is from me.

538
00:40:30,564 --> 00:40:32,607
It's a phone.

539
00:40:33,818 --> 00:40:36,820
-Oh, I can see that.
-I just thought--

540
00:40:36,987 --> 00:40:39,239
Well, we thought
that it would make things easier.

541
00:40:39,824 --> 00:40:41,408
Well, thank you, Karen.

542
00:40:41,575 --> 00:40:44,494
There's nothing wrong with making things
less hard on yourself.

543
00:40:44,662 --> 00:40:47,163
Karen's right, Dad. You've worked hard
your whole life.

544
00:40:47,331 --> 00:40:51,084
Maybe it's time you started thinking about,
you know, taking it easier.

545
00:40:52,169 --> 00:40:56,005
Jeez. That's another thing, Dad.
You really should get rid of the coffin nails.

546
00:40:57,258 --> 00:40:59,884
But, I don't know, we were thinking
about the house.

547
00:41:00,052 --> 00:41:03,096
You know, what with Mom gone,
it's gotta be a lot to maintain around here.

548
00:41:03,264 --> 00:41:04,848
-Mm-hm.
-Let alone clean.

549
00:41:05,516 --> 00:41:08,184
And, I don't know, you're here all alone.

550
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:12,230
Yeah, and there are these great places now,
you know, these communities...

551
00:41:12,398 --> 00:41:16,484
...where you don't have to worry
about mowing the lawn or shoveling snow...

552
00:41:16,652 --> 00:41:20,655
...where the people are like you,
active and alert, but are alone...

553
00:41:20,823 --> 00:41:24,534
...and would benefit from being
around folks their own age.

554
00:41:24,702 --> 00:41:28,163
Yeah, Dad, look. You gotta check it out.
We've brought some brochures.

555
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:30,957
These places are nothing like
what you'd think they'd be.

556
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:32,917
-They're great.
-No, no, beautiful.

557
00:41:33,085 --> 00:41:38,548
They're really nice. They really are.
These are top-notch, like, resorts.

558
00:41:38,716 --> 00:41:41,676
-It's like staying in a hotel practically.
-They're beautiful.

559
00:41:41,844 --> 00:41:43,011
They really are.
-Yeah.

560
00:41:43,179 --> 00:41:47,015
They take care of everything.
They'll clean up. They're really nice.

561
00:41:47,183 --> 00:41:49,434
They have wonderful stores.
You can buy new shoes.

562
00:41:49,602 --> 00:41:52,479
- They're amazing. They really are.
- You'd have a good time.

563
00:41:52,646 --> 00:41:56,524
-Play some golf, maybe.
Meet other people.

564
00:41:58,652 --> 00:42:00,778
Son of a bitch.
Kicking us out on his birthday.

565
00:42:00,946 --> 00:42:03,573
-I told you this was a bad idea.
-I know. You were right.

566
00:42:03,741 --> 00:42:06,951
-He won't let anybody help him.
-Well, we tried. Can we just drop it?

567
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:08,870
No one can say we didn't try.

568
00:42:09,038 --> 00:42:11,372
The hell with him.
You know what we should've done?

569
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,625
We should've stayed home
with Josh and Ashley.

570
00:42:13,792 --> 00:42:15,919
At least they were smart enough
to not come.

571
00:42:16,086 --> 00:42:18,588
Goddamn kids have more sense
than we do.

572
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:24,052
We miss Mama, don't we, Daisy? Yeah.

573
00:42:27,014 --> 00:42:29,390
Yeah.

574
00:42:42,363 --> 00:42:43,696
Hey, Walt.

575
00:42:43,864 --> 00:42:45,782
What are you up to?

576
00:42:47,451 --> 00:42:49,786
We're having a barbecue.
You wanna come over?

577
00:42:49,954 --> 00:42:52,956
-What do you think?
-There's tons of food.

578
00:42:53,791 --> 00:42:56,751
Yeah. Just keep your hands off my dog.

579
00:42:56,919 --> 00:43:00,463
-No worries. We only eat cats.
-Really?

580
00:43:00,631 --> 00:43:04,300
No, I'm kidding, you moron.
Come on, you can be my special guest.

581
00:43:04,468 --> 00:43:07,095
No, I'm fine right here.

582
00:43:08,013 --> 00:43:09,472
Yeah.

583
00:43:11,308 --> 00:43:15,311
-Son of a bitch.
-Okay, so, what have you had to eat today?

584
00:43:17,398 --> 00:43:21,484
Oh, I had a piece of cake
and a little beef jerky.

585
00:43:21,986 --> 00:43:25,321
Come on over and get something to eat.
We've got beer too.

586
00:43:27,825 --> 00:43:34,122
Well, I might as well drink with strangers
rather than drink alone.

587
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:36,541
After all, it is my birthday.

588
00:43:36,709 --> 00:43:41,671
-Really? Happy birthday, Wally.
-Don't call me Wally.

589
00:43:48,178 --> 00:43:51,514
Well, no Pabst, but plenty of beer.

590
00:43:51,682 --> 00:43:56,436
-As they say, when in Humong.
-Ha, ha. Hey, what am I doing wrong?

591
00:43:56,604 --> 00:43:59,188
Every time I look at somebody,
they look at the ground.

592
00:43:59,356 --> 00:44:01,190
You're fine.

593
00:44:06,488 --> 00:44:08,865
What's she saying?
-She said welcome to her home.

594
00:44:09,033 --> 00:44:11,451
-Oh, no, she's not.
-Yeah, no, she didn't.

595
00:44:12,161 --> 00:44:15,371
-She hates me. Come on.
-Yeah, she hates you.

596
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,416
Okay. Hey.

597
00:44:24,256 --> 00:44:27,508
Hey, what are all you fish heads
looking at anyway?

598
00:44:28,469 --> 00:44:32,513
I think we should go
into the other room. Sorry.

599
00:44:37,144 --> 00:44:39,562
A lot of people in this house
are very traditional.

600
00:44:39,730 --> 00:44:43,650
Number one, never touch a Hmong person
on their head, not even a child.

601
00:44:43,817 --> 00:44:48,237
Hmong people believe that the soul
resides on the head, so don't do that.

602
00:44:48,405 --> 00:44:50,406
Well, sounds dumb, but fine.

603
00:44:50,574 --> 00:44:55,161
Yeah, and a lot of Hmong people consider
looking someone in the eye to be very rude.

604
00:44:55,329 --> 00:44:58,039
That's why they look away
when you look at them.

605
00:44:58,207 --> 00:44:59,749
-Anything else?
-Yeah.

606
00:44:59,917 --> 00:45:04,462
Some Hmong people tend to smile or grin
when they're yelled at.

607
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:09,175
It's a cultural thing.
It expresses embarrassment or insecurity.

608
00:45:09,343 --> 00:45:11,594
It's not that they're laughing
at you or anything.

609
00:45:11,762 --> 00:45:14,514
Yeah. God, you people are nuts.

610
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:20,770
But the food does look good.
Smells good too.

611
00:45:20,938 --> 00:45:23,106
Well, of course. It's Hmong food.

612
00:45:23,273 --> 00:45:27,735
Yeah. Okay.
Can I come back for seconds?

613
00:45:36,745 --> 00:45:37,787
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

614
00:45:37,955 --> 00:45:40,206
You know, you mentioned
about looking at people.

615
00:45:40,374 --> 00:45:43,584
-He's been staring at me the whole evening.
-That's Kor Khue.

616
00:45:43,752 --> 00:45:45,128
He's the Lor family shaman.

617
00:45:45,295 --> 00:45:48,089
And what's that, some sort
of a witch doctor or something?

618
00:45:48,257 --> 00:45:50,299
-Something like that.
-Yeah. Booga-booga.

619
00:45:50,467 --> 00:45:53,469
Ha, ha. Very funny, Wally.

620
00:46:08,569 --> 00:46:10,987
Kor Khue's interested in you.
He heard what you did.

621
00:46:11,155 --> 00:46:14,031
He would like to read you.
It'd be rude not to allow him this.

622
00:46:14,199 --> 00:46:15,908
It's a great honor.

623
00:46:16,577 --> 00:46:21,205
-Yeah, sure, fine by me. Sure.
-All right. Take a seat.

624
00:46:22,166 --> 00:46:23,666
Here?

625
00:46:38,307 --> 00:46:42,185
He says that people do not respect you.
They don't even wanna look at you.

626
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:50,985
He says the way you live,
your food has no flavor.

627
00:46:51,153 --> 00:46:53,404
You're worried about your life.

628
00:47:01,705 --> 00:47:04,874
You made a mistake in your past life,
like a mistake that you did...

629
00:47:05,042 --> 00:47:07,210
...you're not satisfied with.

630
00:47:12,716 --> 00:47:17,220
He says you have no happiness in your life.
It's like you're not at peace.

631
00:47:43,539 --> 00:47:44,580
Are you all right?

632
00:47:46,542 --> 00:47:49,877
Yeah, I'm.... Yeah, I'm fine.

633
00:47:50,045 --> 00:47:53,422
Fine. I'm fine.

634
00:48:13,277 --> 00:48:15,862
God, I've got more in common
with these gooks...

635
00:48:16,029 --> 00:48:19,031
...than I do my own spoilt rotten family.

636
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:21,617
Jesus Christ.

637
00:48:24,121 --> 00:48:26,455
Happy birthday.

638
00:48:28,125 --> 00:48:31,794
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

639
00:48:32,963 --> 00:48:34,130
You were bleeding.

640
00:48:34,298 --> 00:48:38,342
No, I bit my tongue. It's nothing.

641
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:40,970
Why don't we go
and get some of that good gook food?

642
00:48:41,138 --> 00:48:44,223
-You know, I'm starving.
-Okay.

643
00:48:49,646 --> 00:48:53,149
Fantastic. Well, you ladies are wonderful.

644
00:48:53,317 --> 00:48:55,985
This stuff is really good.

645
00:49:03,827 --> 00:49:05,411
Come on, you glutton.

646
00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:07,288
-What's up?
-Let's go.

647
00:49:08,165 --> 00:49:10,666
-What for?
To mingle.

648
00:49:10,834 --> 00:49:12,960
Mingle? We're mingling right here.

649
00:49:13,128 --> 00:49:16,339
Come on. You told me
not to leave you alone.

650
00:49:19,843 --> 00:49:23,846
Thank you very much, but I have
to go now. I have to go now.

651
00:49:24,806 --> 00:49:28,809
I'll be back.
Now, don't let anything go away.

652
00:49:37,694 --> 00:49:38,736
Oh, great.

653
00:49:38,904 --> 00:49:41,614
Well, well, well. Look who's over there.

654
00:49:41,782 --> 00:49:44,867
-Yeah, the kid who stole my Gran Torino.
-My brother, Thao.

655
00:49:45,035 --> 00:49:49,121
Tried to, anyway. Yeah. Yeah, Toad.

656
00:50:19,152 --> 00:50:22,405
It was a little wobbly,
but that should fix it.

657
00:50:33,625 --> 00:50:35,209
So where are you guys from?

658
00:50:35,377 --> 00:50:37,586
-I'm not far from here.
-I'm from Texas.

659
00:50:53,603 --> 00:50:57,231
-What's this?
-A little rice liquor. Here, try it.

660
00:50:57,399 --> 00:50:58,691
All right.

661
00:51:22,799 --> 00:51:25,801
My friends and I were just wondering
what you're doing here.

662
00:51:25,969 --> 00:51:29,055
Well, that's a good question.
What am I doing here?

663
00:51:29,598 --> 00:51:32,391
-Name's Walt.
-Hi, Walt. I'm Youa.

664
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:36,270
-Yuam. A pleasure.
-No. Youa.

665
00:51:36,938 --> 00:51:38,439
Youa, okay.

666
00:51:38,607 --> 00:51:41,817
So, what do you do?

667
00:51:41,985 --> 00:51:45,071
-Oh, I fix things, stuff like that.
-Like what?

668
00:51:45,238 --> 00:51:50,743
Well, I just fixed that dryer there,
I fixed my wife's friend's sink...

669
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:55,998
...and I took old Aunt Mary to the doctor's
to get her prescription fixed up.

670
00:51:56,166 --> 00:52:00,503
And then I even fixed a door
that hadn't even broken yet.

671
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:02,505
You're funny.

672
00:52:02,672 --> 00:52:05,174
I've been called a lot of things,
but never funny.

673
00:52:05,717 --> 00:52:11,305
-Well, I'm gonna take off. Enjoy yourself.
-Okay. Yum Yum. Pleasure.

674
00:52:14,851 --> 00:52:17,728
Look, she's going, man. Come on.

675
00:52:19,022 --> 00:52:21,565
Youa, wait up.

676
00:52:21,733 --> 00:52:25,945
Relax, zipperhead.
I'm not gonna shoot you.

677
00:52:26,655 --> 00:52:29,615
I'd look down too, if I was you.

678
00:52:29,783 --> 00:52:32,618
I knew you were a dipshit
the first time I ever saw you...

679
00:52:32,786 --> 00:52:35,121
...but I never thought you were worse
with women...

680
00:52:35,288 --> 00:52:38,624
...than you are at stealing cars, Toad.

681
00:52:39,459 --> 00:52:41,961
-It's Thao.
-What?

682
00:52:42,546 --> 00:52:45,464
It's not Toad, it's Thao.
My name is Thao.

683
00:52:45,632 --> 00:52:48,342
Yeah, well, you're blowing it with that girl
who was there.

684
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:51,387
Not that I give two shits
about a toad like you.

685
00:52:51,555 --> 00:52:54,306
-You don't know what you're talking about.
-You're wrong.

686
00:52:54,474 --> 00:52:56,267
I know exactly what I'm talking about.

687
00:52:56,434 --> 00:52:58,894
I may not be the most pleasant person
to be around...

688
00:52:59,062 --> 00:53:02,565
...but I got the best woman
that was ever on this planet to marry me.

689
00:53:02,732 --> 00:53:05,693
I worked at it. It was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

690
00:53:05,861 --> 00:53:09,655
But you, you know, you're letting
Click Clack, Ding Dong, and Charlie Chan...

691
00:53:09,823 --> 00:53:11,866
...just walk out
with Miss What's-Her-Face.

692
00:53:12,242 --> 00:53:15,911
She likes you, you know?
Though I don't know why.

693
00:53:16,496 --> 00:53:18,038
Who?

694
00:53:18,915 --> 00:53:23,002
Yum Yum. You know, the girl
in the purple sweater.

695
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:26,380
She's been looking at you all day, stupid.

696
00:53:27,424 --> 00:53:29,091
You mean Youa.

697
00:53:29,259 --> 00:53:32,595
Yeah, Yum Yum, yeah. Nice girl. Nice girl.
A very charming girl.

698
00:53:32,762 --> 00:53:35,097
I talked with her. Yeah.

699
00:53:35,265 --> 00:53:38,434
But you, you let her just walk right out
with the Three Stooges.

700
00:53:38,602 --> 00:53:41,228
And you know why?
Because you're a big, fat pussy.

701
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:45,524
Well...

702
00:53:46,401 --> 00:53:47,818
...I gotta go.

703
00:53:47,986 --> 00:53:51,113
Good day, puss-cake.

704
00:54:04,252 --> 00:54:06,212
No. No more.

705
00:54:09,299 --> 00:54:11,842
Well, okay, put them over there.

706
00:54:19,809 --> 00:54:21,352
Bye-bye.

707
00:54:26,107 --> 00:54:29,652
No, no. No, no more. No more.
Come on. No more, now.

708
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:34,323
No more, please. I--

709
00:54:35,492 --> 00:54:38,410
Is this that chicken-dumpling thing
you brought the other--?

710
00:54:38,578 --> 00:54:40,287
Oh, all right.

711
00:54:42,749 --> 00:54:44,083
Come on, ladies.

712
00:54:45,669 --> 00:54:49,338
Certainly better than beef jerky,
I'll tell you.

713
00:55:01,977 --> 00:55:06,438
What's going on?

714
00:55:06,606 --> 00:55:08,732
Thao is here to make amends.
He's here to work for you.

715
00:55:10,193 --> 00:55:13,362
No, he isn't.
He's not gonna work for me.

716
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:16,907
My mom said he dishonored the family
and now he has to work off his debt.

717
00:55:17,075 --> 00:55:19,785
-He'll start tomorrow morning.
-Not tomorrow, not any time.

718
00:55:19,953 --> 00:55:23,497
I don't even want him on my property.
I thought we went over all that.

719
00:55:25,208 --> 00:55:29,336
It's very important that you accept,
and it would be an insult if you refuse.

720
00:55:29,504 --> 00:55:31,213
Why is this being put back on me?

721
00:55:31,381 --> 00:55:33,382
He's the one who tried to steal my car.

722
00:55:33,550 --> 00:55:35,634
All of a sudden, I'm the bad guy in this.

723
00:55:35,802 --> 00:55:38,345
Look, my family is very traditional...

724
00:55:38,513 --> 00:55:41,473
...and would be very much upset
if you don't let Thao repay.

725
00:55:41,641 --> 00:55:44,018
If he doesn't wanna do it,
then let's just go.

726
00:55:44,185 --> 00:55:46,228
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

727
00:55:48,398 --> 00:55:50,691
Yeah. Shut up.

728
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:54,028
All right. Tomorrow, come on.

729
00:55:54,195 --> 00:55:57,239
Tomorrow. Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

730
00:55:57,407 --> 00:55:58,907
Thank you.

731
00:56:00,994 --> 00:56:05,456
Jesus, Joseph, and Mary,
these Hmong broads are like badgers.

732
00:56:10,211 --> 00:56:13,672
Son of a bitch,
I never thought he'd show.

733
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:22,014
All right. What are you good at?

734
00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:25,017
Like what?

735
00:56:26,102 --> 00:56:28,270
Well, that's what I'm asking.

736
00:56:28,646 --> 00:56:31,523
If you're gonna work for me,
I gotta know what you're good at.

737
00:56:31,691 --> 00:56:33,942
I gotta know what you can do.

738
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:35,444
I don't know.

739
00:56:36,237 --> 00:56:39,948
Well, that's kind of halfway
what I expected you to say.

740
00:56:40,116 --> 00:56:41,784
You see that tree right there?

741
00:56:41,951 --> 00:56:44,578
You just go over there
and count the birds.

742
00:56:45,789 --> 00:56:47,414
You want me to count the birds?

743
00:56:47,582 --> 00:56:52,795
Yeah, you can count. All you slopes
are supposed to be good at math, right?

744
00:56:52,962 --> 00:56:55,881
-Yeah, I can count.
-Good.

745
00:57:02,389 --> 00:57:04,264
One, two....

746
00:57:09,312 --> 00:57:13,065
So, what do you have for me today?
You want me to watch paint dry?

747
00:57:13,233 --> 00:57:17,986
-Maybe even count the clouds that pass by?
-Don't get flip with me, boy.

748
00:57:18,154 --> 00:57:21,615
I'm not the one who tried to steal.
Don't you forget that.

749
00:57:23,493 --> 00:57:27,371
Go ahead. I don't care if you insult me
or say racist things.

750
00:57:27,539 --> 00:57:30,165
Because you know what? I'll take it.

751
00:57:30,333 --> 00:57:34,086
Yeah, course you'll take it, because you
have no teeth, you have no balls, kid.

752
00:57:36,172 --> 00:57:39,007
Look, I'm stuck here...

753
00:57:39,175 --> 00:57:42,594
...so why don't you just find something
useful for me to do?

754
00:57:42,762 --> 00:57:47,766
Because unlike you, I'm not useless,
and I maintain my own property.

755
00:57:48,184 --> 00:57:51,812
You swamp rats, on the other hand,
you just can't help but....

756
00:57:53,857 --> 00:57:56,275
How long do I have you for?

757
00:57:58,736 --> 00:58:03,323
-Toad? How long?
-Till next Friday.

758
00:58:05,493 --> 00:58:06,910
Yeah.

759
00:58:08,371 --> 00:58:12,207
All right. Go get the ladder
out of the garage.

760
00:58:14,669 --> 00:58:19,840
When you get finished with that roof there,
you can take that gutter and nail it back up.

761
00:58:20,008 --> 00:58:23,135
I'm tired of looking at it
the last three years.

762
00:58:28,725 --> 00:58:30,434
Yeah.

763
00:58:30,894 --> 00:58:33,479
Yeah, you said it, brother.

764
00:59:38,253 --> 00:59:39,545
Hello.

765
00:59:39,712 --> 00:59:41,421
Grandpa says he wants to know...

766
00:59:41,589 --> 00:59:47,761
...if you can have Thao clear out
the big wasp nest under our porch.

767
00:59:48,304 --> 00:59:49,972
Wasp nest?

768
00:59:50,139 --> 00:59:51,723
Well, that's terrible.

769
00:59:51,891 --> 00:59:55,936
Yeah, well, I think we can handle that
after lunch.

770
01:00:32,473 --> 01:00:35,183
Jesus, Lord Almighty, knock it off.

771
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:39,605
Hey, it's my last day.
So, what else do you have for me to do?

772
01:00:41,649 --> 01:00:44,276
Take the day off. You've done enough.

773
01:00:50,491 --> 01:00:51,533
Toad.

774
01:00:55,872 --> 01:00:58,373
Nothing, never mind.

775
01:01:05,757 --> 01:01:08,133
The doctor will see you now. Thank you.

776
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:32,240
Koski?

777
01:01:38,998 --> 01:01:43,502
Mr. Kowalski? Good morning.
I looked over your paperwork...

778
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:47,005
...and I think we should immediately
start a full battery of tests.

779
01:01:47,173 --> 01:01:50,759
I feel that this would be the best
way to go about...

780
01:01:50,927 --> 01:01:53,762
-...checking out the issues that you've had--
-Excuse me.

781
01:01:53,930 --> 01:01:56,723
What happened to Dr. Feldman,
my regular doctor?

782
01:01:57,433 --> 01:02:02,104
Dr. Feldman retired three years ago.
I'm his replacement, Dr. Chu.

783
01:02:10,238 --> 01:02:12,072
-It's Grandpa Walt.
-Pick it up.

784
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,116
-You talk to him.
-Mitch.

785
01:02:15,368 --> 01:02:19,746
-I'm doing bills here.
You talk to him. He's your father.

786
01:02:24,252 --> 01:02:25,544
Hey, Dad.

787
01:02:25,712 --> 01:02:29,965
Hi, Mitch, it's-- It's me, your dad.

788
01:02:30,133 --> 01:02:32,175
Yeah, I know. What's up?

789
01:02:32,343 --> 01:02:34,469
Oh, nothing. Nothing much, really.

790
01:02:35,722 --> 01:02:40,100
-How's everything going?
-I'm fine. Fine. Doing fine.

791
01:02:40,268 --> 01:02:45,856
Fine. Good.
How about Karen and the kids?

792
01:02:46,065 --> 01:02:49,818
Fine, everybody's great. Doing fine.

793
01:02:49,986 --> 01:02:54,990
-Good. How about work?
-Busy.

794
01:02:55,825 --> 01:02:59,161
- Yeah.
-Yeah, I suppose.

795
01:02:59,328 --> 01:03:03,415
In fact, speaking of busy,
I got a lot on my plate right now...

796
01:03:03,583 --> 01:03:05,584
...so if there's not something pressing....

797
01:03:07,128 --> 01:03:10,422
No. No, not at all.

798
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:13,091
So why don't you call me this weekend?

799
01:03:13,551 --> 01:03:14,634
Sure.

800
01:03:14,802 --> 01:03:17,637
Okay. It was nice talking to you, Dad.
Thanks for calling.

801
01:03:17,805 --> 01:03:20,849
Thanks. Yeah.

802
01:04:05,603 --> 01:04:07,729
This kid doesn't have a chance.

803
01:04:22,995 --> 01:04:27,666
-What do you know about faucets?
-I know a lot about them, boy.

804
01:04:28,334 --> 01:04:30,252
Stand aside.

805
01:04:30,795 --> 01:04:34,339
-Jesus. For the love of Pete.
-What?

806
01:04:34,507 --> 01:04:38,969
It must be a hundred degrees in here.
Why don't you turn on the fan?

807
01:04:48,437 --> 01:04:50,438
The place is falling apart.

808
01:04:54,610 --> 01:04:57,362
Man, where'd you get all this stuff?

809
01:04:57,530 --> 01:05:01,116
-What are you talking about?
-All the tools and stuff.

810
01:05:02,618 --> 01:05:05,912
Well, it may come as a surprise
to a thief...

811
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:09,291
...but I bought this stuff, everything in here,
with my own money.

812
01:05:09,458 --> 01:05:11,459
Yeah, yeah. That's not what I meant.

813
01:05:11,627 --> 01:05:13,920
I mean, there's just so much shit
packed in here.

814
01:05:14,088 --> 01:05:18,049
Yeah. Well, every tool in here
has a purpose.

815
01:05:18,217 --> 01:05:20,135
Everything has a job to do.

816
01:05:20,303 --> 01:05:22,679
They're all to use if necessary.

817
01:05:22,847 --> 01:05:25,098
Okay, so, what's that?

818
01:05:25,266 --> 01:05:27,100
-That's a post-hole digger.
-That?

819
01:05:27,268 --> 01:05:28,351
Vise grips.

820
01:05:28,519 --> 01:05:30,103
-That?
-Wire cutters.

821
01:05:30,271 --> 01:05:32,439
You know it's a trowel, come on.

822
01:05:32,607 --> 01:05:34,774
Those are shears there,
and that's a saw.

823
01:05:34,942 --> 01:05:37,485
That's a tack hammer.
You can't fool me, kid.

824
01:05:40,364 --> 01:05:42,407
All right, what's on your mind?

825
01:05:43,451 --> 01:05:46,995
It's just, I can't afford
to buy all this stuff.

826
01:05:47,538 --> 01:05:51,583
Well, I guess even a bonehead
like you could understand...

827
01:05:51,751 --> 01:05:54,836
...that a man acquires this
over a period of 50 years.

828
01:05:55,004 --> 01:05:59,132
-Yeah, but....
-All right, look, here.

829
01:05:59,842 --> 01:06:03,261
Take these three items, right here.
You can have this.

830
01:06:03,429 --> 01:06:08,975
WD-40, vise grips and some duct tape.

831
01:06:09,143 --> 01:06:12,854
Any man worth his salt
can do half of the household chores...

832
01:06:13,022 --> 01:06:14,522
...with just those three things.

833
01:06:14,690 --> 01:06:17,192
Anything else you need,
you just borrow it, that's all.

834
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:19,694
Okay. Cool.

835
01:06:28,704 --> 01:06:31,414
-Fuck me.
-What's with that?

836
01:06:31,582 --> 01:06:33,708
Nothing. What?

837
01:06:33,876 --> 01:06:36,378
Nothing, huh?
I just saw you coughed up blood.

838
01:06:36,545 --> 01:06:39,547
That's not good.
You should really see a doctor.

839
01:06:41,676 --> 01:06:43,259
Yeah.

840
01:06:43,594 --> 01:06:45,261
Look...

841
01:06:45,888 --> 01:06:50,433
...those guys who were here
the other night, on my lawn.

842
01:06:50,601 --> 01:06:51,685
What about them?

843
01:06:51,852 --> 01:06:53,937
Just a gang, a bunch
of Hmong gangbangers.

844
01:06:54,105 --> 01:06:57,023
Yeah, I assumed that,
but what were they doing here?

845
01:06:57,191 --> 01:06:58,942
They were gonna take me away.

846
01:06:59,110 --> 01:07:03,196
They were kind of pissed
that I blew my first initiation.

847
01:07:03,364 --> 01:07:09,452
Yeah. Well, you are a pussy, you know,
you wanna hang out with guys like that.

848
01:07:09,620 --> 01:07:11,496
What was your initiation supposed to be?

849
01:07:21,716 --> 01:07:23,425
My Gran Torino?

850
01:07:26,554 --> 01:07:29,014
Christ all Friday.

851
01:07:47,116 --> 01:07:48,658
Shit.

852
01:07:52,580 --> 01:07:54,164
Toad, you got a minute?

853
01:07:55,291 --> 01:07:57,834
All right. Okay.

854
01:07:58,002 --> 01:07:59,419
Here it is.

855
01:07:59,587 --> 01:08:02,881
Here's the deal. I take the top
because that's the heaviest.

856
01:08:03,049 --> 01:08:05,258
I pull on that,
and you stand right back here...

857
01:08:05,426 --> 01:08:08,053
...and you push
and help me push it up each step.

858
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:10,180
-Just like that.
-Then let me take the top.

859
01:08:10,347 --> 01:08:11,639
No, no, I've got the top.

860
01:08:11,807 --> 01:08:13,725
Really, I'll take the top.
It looks heavy.

861
01:08:13,893 --> 01:08:16,478
Look, I'm not crippled. I've got the top.

862
01:08:16,645 --> 01:08:19,230
If you don't let me take the top,
I ain't helping.

863
01:08:19,398 --> 01:08:22,067
-Now, listen to me, zipperhead--
-No, you listen, old man.

864
01:08:22,234 --> 01:08:26,071
I'm here because you needed help.
So it's either top or I'm out of here.

865
01:08:29,825 --> 01:08:34,913
All right. You take the top, and I'll push.

866
01:08:35,081 --> 01:08:40,085
Just don't let it slip out of your
little-girl hands and crush me.

867
01:08:41,170 --> 01:08:42,504
Don't give me any ideas, now.

868
01:08:52,723 --> 01:08:55,100
-That thing weighs a ton.
-Yeah.

869
01:08:55,768 --> 01:08:59,854
It runs like a clock, though. They just
don't make them like this anymore.

870
01:09:00,022 --> 01:09:02,607
So, what are you gonna do with it?

871
01:09:03,234 --> 01:09:05,026
Sell it, I guess.

872
01:09:06,362 --> 01:09:07,570
How much?

873
01:09:08,405 --> 01:09:11,199
60 bucks. They....

874
01:09:11,367 --> 01:09:14,744
I'm tired of having it sit around
down in the basement there.

875
01:09:14,912 --> 01:09:18,248
Why? You looking for a freezer?

876
01:09:18,415 --> 01:09:20,542
The downstairs one kind of died.

877
01:09:20,709 --> 01:09:23,586
Okay. 25 bucks and it's yours.

878
01:09:23,754 --> 01:09:26,089
Twenty-five? But you just said 60.

879
01:09:26,257 --> 01:09:29,217
I know, but this'll save me money
putting an ad in the paper.

880
01:09:29,385 --> 01:09:32,679
-Come on, let's wheel it over to your place.
-All right. Okay.

881
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:40,854
-Kind of ironic, huh?
What?

882
01:09:41,021 --> 01:09:43,982
Toad washing the car
that he tried to steal from you.

883
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:48,361
Yeah. He misses one spot,
he's doing it all over again too.

884
01:09:48,529 --> 01:09:50,572
It's nice of you to
look after him like this.

885
01:09:50,739 --> 01:09:53,032
He doesn't have any real role models
in his life.

886
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:54,701
Well, I'm not any role model.

887
01:09:54,869 --> 01:09:56,578
But you're a good man, Wally.

888
01:09:56,745 --> 01:09:58,872
I wish our father
would've been more like you.

889
01:09:59,039 --> 01:10:01,708
-Don't go calling me Wally.
-No, I'm serious.

890
01:10:01,876 --> 01:10:05,795
He was really hard on us, really traditional,
and really old-school.

891
01:10:05,963 --> 01:10:10,592
-Yeah, well, I'm old-school.
-Yeah, but you're an American.

892
01:10:11,719 --> 01:10:13,553
What's that supposed to mean?

893
01:10:17,391 --> 01:10:18,725
You like him, don't you?

894
01:10:18,893 --> 01:10:21,519
Are you kidding? He tried to steal my car.

895
01:10:21,687 --> 01:10:23,688
Uh-huh. And you spend time with him...

896
01:10:23,856 --> 01:10:27,317
...teach him how to fix things,
saved him from that fucked cousin of ours.

897
01:10:27,484 --> 01:10:31,112
-Hey. Watch your language, lady.
-And you're a good man.

898
01:10:31,947 --> 01:10:34,073
I'm not a good man.

899
01:10:34,241 --> 01:10:37,577
Get me another beer, dragon lady.
This one's empty.

900
01:10:44,335 --> 01:10:48,546
You know, the Hmong consider gardening
to be women's work.

901
01:10:48,923 --> 01:10:53,051
Yeah. That's probably why I see you
in the garden over there all the time.

902
01:10:53,219 --> 01:10:55,720
Besides, we ain't in Humong.

903
01:10:55,888 --> 01:10:57,639
Funny.

904
01:10:59,808 --> 01:11:03,603
You know, you should quit.
That's bad for you.

905
01:11:03,771 --> 01:11:07,815
Yeah? So is being in a gang, dipshit.

906
01:11:07,983 --> 01:11:11,152
Didn't you hear what I just said?
I saw you cough up blood.

907
01:11:12,738 --> 01:11:14,656
You should quit.

908
01:11:15,658 --> 01:11:17,992
So, what's that emblem supposed
to mean anyway?

909
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:20,954
Is it your ancient Cub Scout emblem?

910
01:11:21,830 --> 01:11:24,916
First Cavalry. I've had it since '51 .

911
01:11:27,670 --> 01:11:29,921
So, what do you want to do
with your life, kid?

912
01:11:30,256 --> 01:11:34,008
Well, I was thinking about maybe sales.

913
01:11:34,176 --> 01:11:35,843
Sales, huh?

914
01:11:36,971 --> 01:11:39,347
My oldest son is in sales.

915
01:11:39,515 --> 01:11:44,060
-Does he do well?
-Oh, yeah. License to steal.

916
01:11:44,228 --> 01:11:49,107
I work in the Ford factory for 50 years,
and he's out selling Japanese cars.

917
01:11:49,275 --> 01:11:51,734
-You made cars?
-Yeah.

918
01:11:52,611 --> 01:11:55,655
I put the steering column
in this Gran Torino...

919
01:11:55,823 --> 01:11:59,617
...in 1 972, right on the line.

920
01:11:59,994 --> 01:12:03,121
Oh, you are old. So cool.

921
01:12:03,289 --> 01:12:08,835
Yeah. So you wanna be in sales.
You thinking about going to school maybe?

922
01:12:09,003 --> 01:12:13,756
-Kind of, but school costs money.
-Well, maybe you should get a job.

923
01:12:13,924 --> 01:12:18,094
You can't just sit there and spread mulch
in my garden the rest of your life.

924
01:12:18,262 --> 01:12:22,890
-Well, maybe you could just pay me.
-Yeah. Very funny.

925
01:12:24,143 --> 01:12:26,060
Well, what kind of job could I ever get?

926
01:12:26,228 --> 01:12:29,564
Yeah. You're right.
Nobody would ever hire you.

927
01:12:30,774 --> 01:12:31,983
Yeah, I know.

928
01:12:32,151 --> 01:12:35,778
Look, I'm just kidding, zip.
I mean, you could get a job.

929
01:12:35,946 --> 01:12:38,698
-You could get a job anywhere.
-Like what?

930
01:12:38,866 --> 01:12:41,492
-Well, how about construction?
-Me?

931
01:12:41,660 --> 01:12:43,036
-Yeah.
-Construction?

932
01:12:43,203 --> 01:12:47,248
-You have Alzheimer's or something?
-No. You could get a job in construction.

933
01:12:47,416 --> 01:12:49,751
I know people in the trades.

934
01:12:49,918 --> 01:12:53,212
Course, I have to make a little adjustment
and man you up a little bit.

935
01:12:53,672 --> 01:12:56,341
-Man me up?
-Yeah.

936
01:12:56,508 --> 01:12:59,927
And I think you ought to
date Miss Yum Yum too.

937
01:13:00,554 --> 01:13:03,097
Do you a little good.

938
01:13:03,891 --> 01:13:07,101
You know, get a little carbon
off the valves.

939
01:13:11,774 --> 01:13:14,275
Now you're just gonna learn
how guys talk.

940
01:13:14,443 --> 01:13:18,279
You just listen to the way Martin
and I batter it back and forth.

941
01:13:18,447 --> 01:13:20,531
-You okay? You ready?
-Sure.

942
01:13:20,699 --> 01:13:22,909
All right. Let's go in.

943
01:13:25,037 --> 01:13:26,204
Perfect.

944
01:13:26,955 --> 01:13:28,748
A Polack and a chink.

945
01:13:29,666 --> 01:13:32,168
How you doing, Martin,
you crazy Italian prick?

946
01:13:32,336 --> 01:13:36,297
You cheap bastard, I should've known you'd
come in. I was having such a pleasant day.

947
01:13:36,465 --> 01:13:39,300
What'd you do, Jew some poor blind guy
out of his money?

948
01:13:39,468 --> 01:13:42,220
-Gave him the wrong change?
-Who's the Nip?

949
01:13:42,388 --> 01:13:47,058
Oh, he's a pussy kid from next door.
I'm just trying to man him up a little bit.

950
01:13:47,226 --> 01:13:48,851
Mm.

951
01:13:49,019 --> 01:13:52,522
You see, kid? Now, that's how guys
talk to one another.

952
01:13:52,689 --> 01:13:55,024
-They do?
-What, you got shit in your ears?

953
01:13:55,192 --> 01:13:59,237
Now go on out and come back in,
and talk to him like a man.

954
01:13:59,405 --> 01:14:00,571
Like a real man.

955
01:14:00,739 --> 01:14:04,158
-Come on, Walt.
-Come on. Get your ass out of here.

956
01:14:04,326 --> 01:14:06,244
And come on back now.

957
01:14:06,412 --> 01:14:09,205
-Sorry about this.
-It's okay.

958
01:14:14,211 --> 01:14:16,087
What's up, you old Italian prick?

959
01:14:16,755 --> 01:14:19,006
Get out of my shop before
I blow your head off...

960
01:14:19,174 --> 01:14:23,469
-...you goddamn dick-smoking gook!
-Jesus Christ. Oh, shit.

961
01:14:23,971 --> 01:14:25,346
Take it easy. Take it easy.

962
01:14:25,514 --> 01:14:28,433
What the hell are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?

963
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:31,519
But that's what you said.
That what you said men say.

964
01:14:31,687 --> 01:14:34,188
You don't just come in
and insult the man in his shop.

965
01:14:34,356 --> 01:14:38,151
You don't do that. What happens if you
meet some stranger and get the wrong one?

966
01:14:38,318 --> 01:14:41,904
-He's gonna blow your gook head right off.
-What should I have said, then?

967
01:14:42,072 --> 01:14:45,783
Yeah, kid, why don't you start
with "Hi" or "Hello"?

968
01:14:47,369 --> 01:14:49,370
"Sir, I'd like a haircut,
if you have time."

969
01:14:49,538 --> 01:14:51,539
Yeah, be polite, but don't kiss ass.

970
01:14:51,707 --> 01:14:54,667
You could talk about
a construction job you just came from...

971
01:14:54,835 --> 01:14:57,795
...and bitch about your girlfriend
and your car.

972
01:14:57,963 --> 01:15:02,049
Son of a bitch, I just got my brakes fixed,
and those sons of bitches really nailed me.

973
01:15:02,217 --> 01:15:05,303
-I mean, they screwed me right in the ass.
Don't swear at the guy.

974
01:15:05,471 --> 01:15:08,181
Just talk about people
who are not in the room.

975
01:15:08,348 --> 01:15:12,101
You could bitch about your boss making you
work overtime when it's bowling night.

976
01:15:12,269 --> 01:15:15,605
Right. Or my old lady bitches
for two goddamn hours...

977
01:15:15,772 --> 01:15:19,233
...about how they don't take
expired coupons at the grocery store...

978
01:15:19,401 --> 01:15:23,779
...and the minute I turn on the game,
she starts crying how we never talk.

979
01:15:23,947 --> 01:15:26,532
You see? Now go out, come back
and talk to him.

980
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:29,202
And it ain't rocket science, for chrissake.

981
01:15:29,703 --> 01:15:34,540
Yeah, but I don't have a job, a car
or a girlfriend.

982
01:15:34,708 --> 01:15:37,460
Jesus. I should've blown his head off
when I had the chance.

983
01:15:37,628 --> 01:15:38,753
Yeah. Maybe so.

984
01:15:38,921 --> 01:15:42,298
Now, okay, I want you to turn around
and go outside...

985
01:15:42,466 --> 01:15:45,760
...and come back, and don't talk
about having no job...

986
01:15:45,928 --> 01:15:50,139
...no car, no girlfriend,
no future, no dick.

987
01:15:50,307 --> 01:15:53,184
Okay? Just turn around and go.

988
01:16:07,616 --> 01:16:10,868
Excuse me, sir. I need a haircut,
if you ain't too busy.

989
01:16:11,036 --> 01:16:13,955
You old Italian son-of-a-bitch
prick barber.

990
01:16:15,749 --> 01:16:18,960
Boy, does my ass hurt from all the guys
at my construction job.

991
01:16:24,258 --> 01:16:25,299
Fuck me.

992
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:27,969
Jesus Christ.

993
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:41,315
-All set to go through with it, right?
-Yeah, yeah.

994
01:16:41,483 --> 01:16:46,153
Don't "Yeah, yeah" me. Just say, "Yes, sir,"
and, "I'll do my best."

995
01:16:46,321 --> 01:16:47,697
Yes. I'll do my best.

996
01:16:47,864 --> 01:16:50,992
Because when I vouch for somebody,
that means I've given my word.

997
01:16:51,159 --> 01:16:55,413
-And I don't want you making me look bad.
-No, I'm good. Totally into this.

998
01:16:55,581 --> 01:16:59,292
Don't lay down, either.
Just look them straight in the eye.

999
01:16:59,459 --> 01:17:01,961
And a man can tell a lot
by your handshake.

1000
01:17:02,129 --> 01:17:06,007
-Here. Put those in your back pocket.
-Cool.

1001
01:17:06,174 --> 01:17:07,675
Don't blow this.

1002
01:17:09,261 --> 01:17:12,763
Hey, Kennedy, you drunken Irish goon.
How the hell are you?

1003
01:17:12,931 --> 01:17:16,767
-I'm shitty, but who's gonna listen?
Not me, that's for sure.

1004
01:17:16,935 --> 01:17:21,188
Help yourself, there, Walt.
You dumb Polack.

1005
01:17:21,732 --> 01:17:23,941
Okay, this is the kid
I was telling you about.

1006
01:17:24,109 --> 01:17:28,446
Thao, this is Tim Kennedy.
He's the super on this job.

1007
01:17:29,031 --> 01:17:31,866
So, what do we got here, Walt?

1008
01:17:32,117 --> 01:17:36,621
Well, he knows construction,
and he's a smart kid.

1009
01:17:36,788 --> 01:17:38,414
He'll do anything you need him for.

1010
01:17:38,582 --> 01:17:40,416
-You sure?
-Yeah.

1011
01:17:40,584 --> 01:17:43,836
-You speak English?
-Yes, sir.

1012
01:17:44,004 --> 01:17:46,339
-Were you born here?
-You bet.

1013
01:17:46,506 --> 01:17:49,675
I see that Walt drove you here.
You got a vehicle?

1014
01:17:49,843 --> 01:17:51,927
Not at the moment.
Taking the bus for now.

1015
01:17:52,095 --> 01:17:54,722
The bus. Jesus Christ,
you don't have a car?

1016
01:17:54,890 --> 01:17:56,140
My head gasket cracked.

1017
01:17:56,308 --> 01:17:59,393
And the goddamn prick at the shop
wants to bend me over for 2 100.

1018
01:17:59,561 --> 01:18:00,561
Oh, please.

1019
01:18:00,729 --> 01:18:04,398
I replaced the tranny in my Tahoe,
and the sons of bitches fucked me hard.

1020
01:18:04,566 --> 01:18:08,235
-Just under 3200.
-Goddamn thieves. It ain't right.

1021
01:18:09,112 --> 01:18:10,696
You got that right.

1022
01:18:10,864 --> 01:18:15,534
Okay, come on in on Monday,
and we'll find something for you to do.

1023
01:18:16,286 --> 01:18:20,456
-Thanks, Mr. Kennedy.
-It's Tim. And what's your name again?

1024
01:18:20,624 --> 01:18:23,084
-Thao.
-"Tuh," okay.

1025
01:18:23,251 --> 01:18:25,127
You owe me one, Walt.

1026
01:18:25,295 --> 01:18:28,589
Yeah. Well, I'll buy you a fruitcake
for Christmas.

1027
01:18:28,757 --> 01:18:33,552
Fuck the fruitcake. How about you just
hand over them keys to that Gran Torino?

1028
01:18:34,638 --> 01:18:38,182
-Why the hell does everybody want my car?
-Well, I'm not surprised.

1029
01:18:38,350 --> 01:18:42,728
Yeah, you don't know the half of it.
All right, come on, zipperhead.

1030
01:18:42,896 --> 01:18:47,233
We'll let the mick stay here
and play with himself.

1031
01:19:07,546 --> 01:19:08,963
What are we doing?

1032
01:19:09,131 --> 01:19:13,467
What do you wanna do?
Carry your tools in a rice bag?

1033
01:19:21,977 --> 01:19:24,979
Here we are. You can use one of these.

1034
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:28,149
And you'll need one of these. Here.

1035
01:19:29,401 --> 01:19:31,694
- I can't afford any of this.
- I'll cover it.

1036
01:19:31,862 --> 01:19:33,988
You can pay me back
on your first paycheck.

1037
01:19:34,156 --> 01:19:37,867
Cool.
-Here. You'll need something like that.

1038
01:19:38,034 --> 01:19:41,245
Now, this is what I'm looking for.
Here, tool belt.

1039
01:19:41,997 --> 01:19:43,414
-There you go.
-Not to bitch...

1040
01:19:43,582 --> 01:19:45,332
...but won't I be needing some tools?

1041
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:50,004
Tools I've got, but I'm not gonna lend my
tool belt. You can pick up tools as you go.

1042
01:19:50,172 --> 01:19:52,715
-I really appreciate all this.
-Forget it.

1043
01:19:52,883 --> 01:19:56,177
No. I really do. Thank you.

1044
01:20:31,922 --> 01:20:34,131
What's up, homeboy? What you doing?

1045
01:20:34,299 --> 01:20:36,842
- What up, man?
- What you got, punk?

1046
01:20:37,010 --> 01:20:40,679
-Just checking up on my little cousin.
Yeah, man.

1047
01:20:41,389 --> 01:20:45,434
-Our little cousin. What's this?
Where you coming from, man?

1048
01:20:45,602 --> 01:20:47,895
I'm coming home from work.

1049
01:20:48,063 --> 01:20:50,231
Not that you guys would know
much about that.

1050
01:20:50,398 --> 01:20:51,857
So it's true. You got a job.

1051
01:20:52,025 --> 01:20:54,151
You can't just leave me alone?
-What?

1052
01:20:54,903 --> 01:20:55,986
Hey, dog, check this out.

1053
01:20:57,364 --> 01:20:58,405
You scared, huh?

1054
01:20:58,573 --> 01:20:59,949
Who bought this shit for you? Your dad?

1055
01:21:00,116 --> 01:21:01,742
-What do you want?
-Your dad bought this?

1056
01:21:01,910 --> 01:21:04,578
- Keep your hands off my stuff.
- Give me the fucking hat.

1057
01:21:04,746 --> 01:21:08,707
-Why the fuck you gotta make me look bad?
Keep your hands off my stuff!

1058
01:21:08,875 --> 01:21:10,334
Smashing's my job, man.

1059
01:21:12,379 --> 01:21:14,839
-Yo, give me that.
Hey, come on. That's my stuff.

1060
01:21:15,006 --> 01:21:16,841
Throw it over the fence, man, fuck it.

1061
01:21:17,592 --> 01:21:20,177
- Let me go. Let me go.
- Hey, you little bitch.

1062
01:21:20,345 --> 01:21:22,096
Give me that, man. Give me that.

1063
01:21:25,100 --> 01:21:27,935
-What's the phrase I'm looking for?
Fuck him up.

1064
01:21:28,103 --> 01:21:30,521
Oh, yeah. Saving face.

1065
01:21:38,363 --> 01:21:43,033
-Hey there.
-Hey. I gotta run.

1066
01:21:43,285 --> 01:21:45,744
Haven't seen you in a few days.
Where you been?

1067
01:21:45,912 --> 01:21:47,788
-Been busy.
-Yeah.

1068
01:21:48,957 --> 01:21:50,666
Busy, huh?

1069
01:21:52,294 --> 01:21:53,961
Hey.

1070
01:21:54,129 --> 01:21:57,131
-What the hell happened to you?
-Don't worry about it.

1071
01:21:57,299 --> 01:21:59,967
What do you mean, don't worry about it?
Look at your face.

1072
01:22:00,135 --> 01:22:02,803
I said, don't worry about it.
Okay? It's not your problem.

1073
01:22:02,971 --> 01:22:04,471
When?

1074
01:22:04,931 --> 01:22:08,434
Grabbed me a couple days ago,
right after I got off work.

1075
01:22:08,602 --> 01:22:10,227
Cowards.

1076
01:22:10,645 --> 01:22:14,940
I did everything I could possibly do,
but they broke some of your tools.

1077
01:22:15,483 --> 01:22:18,986
-I'll replace them.
-Don't worry about the tools.

1078
01:22:22,824 --> 01:22:25,367
Where does your cousin live?

1079
01:22:27,746 --> 01:22:30,998
No, Walt. I'll be okay.

1080
01:22:31,166 --> 01:22:35,169
-I don't want you to do anything.
-All right.

1081
01:22:35,962 --> 01:22:40,674
If you need any extra tools,
you just let me know.

1082
01:22:41,343 --> 01:22:43,636
Well, I could use a roofing hammer.

1083
01:22:44,137 --> 01:22:47,306
Good. Go in my garage and get it.

1084
01:23:23,385 --> 01:23:25,719
That should be the last of them.

1085
01:23:32,394 --> 01:23:33,560
Hey.

1086
01:23:51,079 --> 01:23:55,249
All right. Here's the deal.
You stay away from Thao, understand?

1087
01:23:55,417 --> 01:23:58,210
You tell your friends
to stay away from Thao.

1088
01:23:58,378 --> 01:24:01,380
If they don't listen, tell them
you don't wanna see them anymore.

1089
01:24:01,548 --> 01:24:03,257
That's it. Got it?

1090
01:24:03,425 --> 01:24:05,968
I'll take that as a yes.
If I have to come back here...

1091
01:24:06,136 --> 01:24:08,971
...it's gonna get fucking ugly.

1092
01:24:32,954 --> 01:24:35,289
Get out of my way.

1093
01:24:53,266 --> 01:24:57,770
How do you want your dog?
I mean, steak?

1094
01:24:57,937 --> 01:25:01,315
Funny.
-I told you, we only eat cats.

1095
01:25:01,483 --> 01:25:04,193
Yeah. Well.

1096
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:06,695
Whoa. I've never
seen you like this before.

1097
01:25:06,863 --> 01:25:09,740
I'm feeling good. You know,
I got beautiful women, great food.

1098
01:25:09,908 --> 01:25:12,993
And Thao.
-And even Thao isn't bugging me.

1099
01:25:13,328 --> 01:25:15,370
-Having a good time, I see.
-Yeah.

1100
01:25:15,538 --> 01:25:19,416
And it never ends.
-What happened to your knuckles anyways?

1101
01:25:21,002 --> 01:25:23,712
I slipped in the shower. No big problem.

1102
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:26,507
Look, now, Yum Yum,
if he doesn't ask you out...

1103
01:25:26,674 --> 01:25:28,175
...I'm gonna ask you out.

1104
01:25:28,343 --> 01:25:32,596
Youa, don't listen to him, Youa.
He's a white devil.

1105
01:25:32,764 --> 01:25:34,681
Yeah, I am. I'm the white devil.

1106
01:25:34,849 --> 01:25:37,518
I'd love to, Walt, but he beat you to it.

1107
01:25:37,685 --> 01:25:41,772
Really? No kidding.
Dinner and a movie or what?

1108
01:25:45,693 --> 01:25:48,195
Yeah. They're taking the bus.

1109
01:25:48,696 --> 01:25:50,572
No, you can't take the bus.

1110
01:25:50,740 --> 01:25:53,534
We gotta get you something
more stylish than that.

1111
01:25:53,701 --> 01:25:55,994
Like what? Take a limo?

1112
01:25:57,330 --> 01:25:58,372
How about that?

1113
01:26:02,001 --> 01:26:04,461
-The Gran Torino?
-Yeah.

1114
01:26:04,629 --> 01:26:09,133
-You'd let me take the Gran Torino?
-Yeah, I'd let you take the Gran Torino.

1115
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:10,384
Really?

1116
01:26:11,636 --> 01:26:14,054
Yeah, really.

1117
01:26:17,559 --> 01:26:19,184
Yeah. Yeah.

1118
01:26:20,854 --> 01:26:23,147
Here's the pitch. And a strike.

1119
01:27:00,852 --> 01:27:02,019
Is everybody all right?

1120
01:27:06,691 --> 01:27:09,902
You're all right. You're okay.
You've got a cut.

1121
01:27:10,069 --> 01:27:13,697
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.
Where's grandma?

1122
01:27:15,742 --> 01:27:18,535
Where is Sue? Where is Sue?

1123
01:27:18,703 --> 01:27:21,163
-She went to our aunt's.
-Your aunt's? You sure?

1124
01:27:21,331 --> 01:27:24,625
-Yeah.
-Get on the phone and call right now.

1125
01:27:56,908 --> 01:27:59,660
I knew this was gonna happen.

1126
01:28:00,161 --> 01:28:03,580
Tried to-- What the hell am I doing here?

1127
01:28:03,748 --> 01:28:07,459
Well, maybe some of her friends called
and they changed plans.

1128
01:28:08,002 --> 01:28:09,711
Yeah.

1129
01:28:11,881 --> 01:28:17,844
In the war, we just lost a lot of friends,
but you're kind of set for it.

1130
01:28:18,012 --> 01:28:20,138
You're geared to it.

1131
01:29:17,238 --> 01:29:22,284
No, no, no.

1132
01:29:29,542 --> 01:29:32,544
You fuck! You rotten fuck!

1133
01:30:24,055 --> 01:30:26,139
Mr. Kowalski?

1134
01:30:35,775 --> 01:30:41,113
-You okay?
-Yeah. I'm okay.

1135
01:30:41,406 --> 01:30:42,739
The police finally left.

1136
01:30:43,699 --> 01:30:45,409
No one's talking.

1137
01:30:45,952 --> 01:30:48,912
One thing about the Hmong,
they keep their mouths shut.

1138
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:50,664
Yeah, I've noticed that.

1139
01:30:58,256 --> 01:31:02,509
You know, Thao and Sue are never
gonna find peace in this world...

1140
01:31:03,511 --> 01:31:05,011
...as long as that gang's around.

1141
01:31:06,931 --> 01:31:09,850
Until they go away, you know, forever.

1142
01:31:13,312 --> 01:31:14,980
What are you saying?

1143
01:31:15,648 --> 01:31:18,024
You know what I'm saying.

1144
01:31:19,235 --> 01:31:21,361
I took Sue to the hospital.

1145
01:31:22,196 --> 01:31:26,116
She's scared. They're all scared.

1146
01:31:26,492 --> 01:31:27,993
Yeah.

1147
01:31:29,579 --> 01:31:31,037
Thao, especially.

1148
01:31:31,205 --> 01:31:34,207
He's sitting out there right now,
staring at your front door.

1149
01:31:35,668 --> 01:31:38,295
You know what he expects,
Mr. Kowalski.

1150
01:31:39,714 --> 01:31:41,339
What would you do?

1151
01:31:42,383 --> 01:31:46,720
-What should Thao do?
-I know what I would do if I was you.

1152
01:31:47,722 --> 01:31:51,892
-Or at least what you think you should do.
-Really?

1153
01:31:52,351 --> 01:31:55,562
If I was Thao,
I guess I'd want vengeance.

1154
01:31:55,730 --> 01:31:59,316
I'd wanna stand shoulder to shoulder
with you and kill those guys.

1155
01:32:00,359 --> 01:32:01,735
And you?

1156
01:32:02,570 --> 01:32:04,029
What would I do?

1157
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:09,326
I'd come over here and talk to you,
I guess.

1158
01:32:11,162 --> 01:32:14,915
I know you're close with these people,
but this pisses me off too, Mr. Kowalski.

1159
01:32:17,919 --> 01:32:19,377
Want a beer?

1160
01:32:19,921 --> 01:32:21,254
I'd love one.

1161
01:32:21,422 --> 01:32:24,883
There's some in the chest
right over there behind you.

1162
01:32:50,284 --> 01:32:51,910
Damn all this.

1163
01:32:53,371 --> 01:32:57,290
-Just isn't fair.
-Nothing's fair, Father.

1164
01:33:00,628 --> 01:33:02,963
So, what are you gonna do,
Mr. Kowalski?

1165
01:33:05,049 --> 01:33:06,716
Call me Walt.

1166
01:33:07,885 --> 01:33:09,469
All right.

1167
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:12,722
What are you gonna do, Walt?

1168
01:33:13,474 --> 01:33:15,225
I don't know...

1169
01:33:15,977 --> 01:33:17,978
...but I'll think of something.

1170
01:33:19,313 --> 01:33:22,857
Whatever it is,
they won't have a chance.

1171
01:33:34,620 --> 01:33:35,662
What are you doing?

1172
01:33:36,956 --> 01:33:41,084
-Thinking.
-Thinking? Thinking time is over.

1173
01:33:41,252 --> 01:33:44,421
Now it's time to knock the shit
out of those pricks.

1174
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:48,842
I know you don't wanna hear this,
but now's the time to stay calm.

1175
01:33:49,010 --> 01:33:51,052
Calm? You want me to be calm?

1176
01:33:51,220 --> 01:33:56,016
We stay calm or else mistakes get made.
We have to step back from this thing.

1177
01:33:56,934 --> 01:34:00,103
No. Don't let me down, Walt. Not you.

1178
01:34:00,271 --> 01:34:02,355
This is gonna end today.

1179
01:34:03,149 --> 01:34:04,274
Sit down.

1180
01:34:04,442 --> 01:34:07,902
-I don't wanna sit.
-I said, sit down.

1181
01:34:11,532 --> 01:34:15,869
Now, listen to me. We gotta plan this,
and plan it very carefully.

1182
01:34:16,454 --> 01:34:18,413
We can't make any mistakes.

1183
01:34:18,581 --> 01:34:21,458
Now, you know I'm the right man
for this job.

1184
01:34:21,626 --> 01:34:23,877
So I want you to go home
and stay calm...

1185
01:34:24,045 --> 01:34:26,713
...and come back here
at 4 this afternoon.

1186
01:34:26,881 --> 01:34:31,885
-And what needs to be done will be done.
-I say we go now. Right now.

1187
01:34:32,053 --> 01:34:35,055
And what? Kill that cousin of yours
and the rest of those zips?

1188
01:34:35,222 --> 01:34:38,308
Mr. Tough Guy out for blood
all of a sudden?

1189
01:34:38,476 --> 01:34:40,935
You know nothing about it.

1190
01:34:43,898 --> 01:34:47,901
Now go home and you stay calm.

1191
01:34:48,069 --> 01:34:51,154
Come back here at 4. All right?

1192
01:34:53,074 --> 01:34:54,866
Okay?

1193
01:34:57,203 --> 01:34:58,745
Okay.

1194
01:35:27,733 --> 01:35:31,569
Yeah. I know, I know.
Give me a break, will you?

1195
01:35:31,737 --> 01:35:34,948
It's the first time I've ever smoked
in the house.

1196
01:35:36,867 --> 01:35:40,870
Let a man enjoy himself, would you, girl?

1197
01:35:44,083 --> 01:35:46,334
All finished. Ten dollars American.

1198
01:35:46,502 --> 01:35:50,046
I don't suppose your Guinea hands
are steady enough to do a straight shave?

1199
01:35:50,214 --> 01:35:52,882
Straight shave? You've never asked
for a straight shave.

1200
01:35:53,050 --> 01:35:57,095
I know, but I've always wondered about it.
That's unless you're too busy.

1201
01:35:57,263 --> 01:36:01,725
-No, just let me heat up a towel.
-Yeah. And here, here's a 20.

1202
01:36:01,892 --> 01:36:06,396
Keep the change. That's just in case
you hit my jugular.

1203
01:36:14,447 --> 01:36:16,990
It's gonna take about one hour.

1204
01:36:17,158 --> 01:36:19,826
We gonna shorten the sleeves a little bit.

1205
01:36:20,578 --> 01:36:22,829
Gonna fix the shoulder.

1206
01:36:22,997 --> 01:36:27,417
-Yeah. I never had a fitted suit before.
-Yes, sir.

1207
01:36:27,585 --> 01:36:31,004
-Mm-hm.
-You look very good.

1208
01:36:38,804 --> 01:36:42,265
-What can I do for you, Mr. Kowalski?
-I'm here for a confession.

1209
01:36:43,017 --> 01:36:45,018
Oh, Lord Jesus. What have you done?

1210
01:36:45,186 --> 01:36:47,937
-Nothing. You just take it easy, now.
-What are you up to?

1211
01:36:48,105 --> 01:36:50,482
Are you gonna give me a confession
or not?

1212
01:36:54,111 --> 01:36:56,321
How long has it been
since your last confession?

1213
01:36:56,489 --> 01:36:58,865
Oh, forever.

1214
01:37:00,493 --> 01:37:03,703
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

1215
01:37:03,871 --> 01:37:06,206
What are your sins, my son?

1216
01:37:07,541 --> 01:37:11,795
Well, in 1 968, I kissed Betty Jablonski...

1217
01:37:11,962 --> 01:37:14,631
...at the factory Christmas party.

1218
01:37:14,799 --> 01:37:18,051
Dorothy was in the other room
with the other wives.

1219
01:37:18,719 --> 01:37:20,845
It just happened.

1220
01:37:21,222 --> 01:37:23,306
Yes, go on.

1221
01:37:23,474 --> 01:37:27,227
Well, I made a 900-dollar profit
selling a boat and a motor.

1222
01:37:27,895 --> 01:37:31,314
I didn't pay the taxes.
It's the same as stealing.

1223
01:37:32,066 --> 01:37:33,900
Yes, fine.

1224
01:37:34,735 --> 01:37:36,236
Oh, lastly...

1225
01:37:37,905 --> 01:37:41,366
...I was never very close
with my two sons.

1226
01:37:42,076 --> 01:37:45,203
I don't know them. I didn't know how.

1227
01:37:47,915 --> 01:37:49,499
That's it?

1228
01:37:49,708 --> 01:37:54,921
That's it? It's bothered me
most of my life.

1229
01:37:56,340 --> 01:37:59,384
Say 10 "Hail Marys"
and five "Our Fathers."

1230
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:04,055
God loves you and forgives you,
and I absolve you of all your sins.

1231
01:38:04,223 --> 01:38:08,601
In the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit.

1232
01:38:09,770 --> 01:38:12,105
Thank you, Padre.

1233
01:38:15,150 --> 01:38:18,194
Are you going to retaliate
for what happened to Sue?

1234
01:38:19,154 --> 01:38:21,531
I'm going over to that house today,
Mr. Kowalski.

1235
01:38:21,699 --> 01:38:22,740
Is that so?

1236
01:38:22,908 --> 01:38:27,120
It is. And every other day until you see
the folly in what you're planning.

1237
01:38:27,288 --> 01:38:31,624
-Busy day. Gotta go.
-Go in peace.

1238
01:38:32,710 --> 01:38:35,128
Oh, I am at peace.

1239
01:38:37,631 --> 01:38:39,966
Jesus Christ.

1240
01:38:53,814 --> 01:38:55,982
So which one's mine?

1241
01:38:57,151 --> 01:39:00,320
You ever fired a weapon before?

1242
01:39:00,487 --> 01:39:02,238
No.

1243
01:39:04,491 --> 01:39:06,784
Well, why don't you put that one down?

1244
01:39:06,952 --> 01:39:09,245
And I got something I wanna show you.
Come on.

1245
01:39:09,413 --> 01:39:11,331
What?

1246
01:39:14,877 --> 01:39:20,006
1 952, we were sent up to take out
a chink machine-gun nest.

1247
01:39:20,174 --> 01:39:22,258
Been shredding us up pretty good.

1248
01:39:22,426 --> 01:39:24,802
I was the only one
that came back that day.

1249
01:39:24,970 --> 01:39:28,848
For that, they gave me a Silver Star.
Here it is.

1250
01:39:30,559 --> 01:39:33,519
Here. I want you to have it.

1251
01:39:34,188 --> 01:39:35,855
Why?

1252
01:39:36,023 --> 01:39:40,109
Why? Because we all knew the dangers
that night, but we went anyway.

1253
01:39:40,277 --> 01:39:42,695
That's the way it might be tonight.

1254
01:39:42,863 --> 01:39:45,031
There's always a chance
you don't come back.

1255
01:39:45,199 --> 01:39:48,534
The hell we won't. We're gonna roll up
in there and tear some ass.

1256
01:39:48,702 --> 01:39:52,372
That's foolish. That's the exact reaction
they're waiting for.

1257
01:39:52,539 --> 01:39:54,207
Go ahead and close this up.

1258
01:39:54,708 --> 01:39:57,877
-How many?
-How many what?

1259
01:39:58,253 --> 01:40:01,214
How many men did you kill in Korea?

1260
01:40:01,632 --> 01:40:06,552
-Thirteen. Maybe more.
-What was it like to kill a man?

1261
01:40:07,429 --> 01:40:09,764
You don't wanna know.

1262
01:40:10,432 --> 01:40:12,642
Now close it up.

1263
01:40:27,574 --> 01:40:31,077
Walt. Walt. What are you doing?

1264
01:40:31,912 --> 01:40:35,832
-What are you doing?
-Relax. You can't get out of there.

1265
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,584
You let me out right now.
Let me out.

1266
01:40:38,752 --> 01:40:42,088
-Fucking let me out or I'll fucking kill you.
-Shut the fuck up.

1267
01:40:42,756 --> 01:40:44,799
You wanna know what it's like
to kill a man?

1268
01:40:44,967 --> 01:40:46,968
Well, it's goddamn awful,
that's what it is.

1269
01:40:47,136 --> 01:40:49,053
The only thing worse
is getting a medal...

1270
01:40:49,221 --> 01:40:53,182
...for killing some poor kid
that wanted to just give up, that's all.

1271
01:40:53,350 --> 01:40:56,352
Yeah, some scared little gook
just like you.

1272
01:40:56,520 --> 01:41:00,440
I shot him in the face with that rifle
you were holding in there a while ago.

1273
01:41:00,607 --> 01:41:04,944
Not a day goes by that I don't think about it,
and you don't want that on your soul.

1274
01:41:05,112 --> 01:41:07,739
Now, I got blood on my hands.
I'm soiled.

1275
01:41:07,906 --> 01:41:11,034
That's why I'm going it alone tonight.

1276
01:41:11,201 --> 01:41:15,413
Walt. You take me with you right now.
Let me out!

1277
01:41:15,581 --> 01:41:20,293
Look, you've come a long way.
I'm proud to say that you're my friend...

1278
01:41:20,461 --> 01:41:24,297
...but you got your whole life ahead of you.
But me, I finish things.

1279
01:41:24,465 --> 01:41:28,134
That's what I do. And I'm going it alone.

1280
01:41:28,302 --> 01:41:32,346
No. Wait! Walt! Walt!

1281
01:41:32,514 --> 01:41:36,225
Walt! Walt! Walt!

1282
01:41:50,491 --> 01:41:53,701
Look, I need you to watch my dog.

1283
01:41:55,496 --> 01:41:57,830
Yeah, I love you too.

1284
01:42:03,212 --> 01:42:05,755
Yeah, she's old too.

1285
01:42:06,507 --> 01:42:11,677
Bye-bye, sweetheart. Take it easy.
Her name is Daisy.

1286
01:42:28,070 --> 01:42:30,321
-Hello?
It's Walt.

1287
01:42:30,489 --> 01:42:33,658
The keys to my house are under
the ceramic turtle on the porch.

1288
01:42:33,826 --> 01:42:37,620
Let yourself in. Your brother's
in the basement. I gotta go.

1289
01:42:53,887 --> 01:42:56,848
Sorry, Father, we have to go.

1290
01:42:57,015 --> 01:43:00,518
I'm telling you, if we're not here,
there will be bloodshed.

1291
01:43:00,686 --> 01:43:02,520
We've been here for hours.

1292
01:43:02,688 --> 01:43:04,939
We can't afford to anchor a unit
to one location.

1293
01:43:05,107 --> 01:43:06,566
I'm begging you to stay.

1294
01:43:07,192 --> 01:43:09,735
Just got word from my sergeant.
We're pulling the plug.

1295
01:43:10,737 --> 01:43:13,573
-I'm staying.
-No, you aren't.

1296
01:43:14,825 --> 01:43:18,744
We have specific orders. You came with us,
you're leaving with us.

1297
01:43:18,912 --> 01:43:20,746
Watch your head.

1298
01:43:30,257 --> 01:43:32,842
Sue. Over here. Over here.

1299
01:43:33,010 --> 01:43:34,635
-Come unlock this.
What's going on?

1300
01:43:34,803 --> 01:43:38,764
He left without me.
He went to Smokie's without me.

1301
01:43:39,933 --> 01:43:41,767
Thao!

1302
01:44:06,210 --> 01:44:08,044
What the fuck, man?

1303
01:44:11,798 --> 01:44:14,300
Any swamp rats in there?

1304
01:44:15,219 --> 01:44:17,929
-I didn't think your ass would've came.
-Shut up, gook.

1305
01:44:19,097 --> 01:44:22,808
I got nothing to say to you,
shrimp-dick midget like you.

1306
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:30,775
Yeah, yeah. You go ahead,
watch out for your boyfriend.

1307
01:44:30,943 --> 01:44:35,571
Because it was either he or you or someone
who raped one of their own family.

1308
01:44:35,739 --> 01:44:37,990
Your own blood, for chrissake.

1309
01:44:38,992 --> 01:44:42,870
Now, go ahead and pull those pistols
like miniature cowboys.

1310
01:44:43,038 --> 01:44:45,164
-Go ahead.
-So where's Thao at?

1311
01:44:45,332 --> 01:44:49,210
-That pussy motherfucker couldn't come?
-Don't worry about Thao.

1312
01:44:49,378 --> 01:44:52,463
Thao's got not one second for you.

1313
01:44:53,215 --> 01:44:56,425
Says who? You?

1314
01:44:57,094 --> 01:44:59,136
What the fuck you gonna do, old man?

1315
01:45:02,307 --> 01:45:03,349
What you gonna do...

1316
01:45:03,517 --> 01:45:05,017
-...punk ass old man?
Bitch.

1317
01:45:05,894 --> 01:45:09,021
-Kind of jumpy, aren't we?
-Shut the fuck up.

1318
01:45:09,189 --> 01:45:11,148
You shut the fuck up.

1319
01:45:22,619 --> 01:45:25,371
-Got a light?
What the fuck?

1320
01:45:29,376 --> 01:45:31,168
No.

1321
01:45:32,045 --> 01:45:35,715
Me. I've got a light.

1322
01:45:39,511 --> 01:45:41,679
Hail Mary, full of grace.

1323
01:46:47,704 --> 01:46:50,122
-Yes, Sergeant.
What happened?

1324
01:46:50,290 --> 01:46:52,458
-You need to step back.
-He's a friend of mine.

1325
01:46:52,626 --> 01:46:54,502
I said, step back.

1326
01:46:55,712 --> 01:46:57,963
Hey, did you hear him? Step back.

1327
01:46:58,131 --> 01:47:00,466
-What happened?
-Hey, step back.

1328
01:47:01,635 --> 01:47:02,802
He's my friend.

1329
01:47:03,095 --> 01:47:04,470
Please, it's important.

1330
01:47:05,430 --> 01:47:08,057
He went for his lighter and they shot him.

1331
01:47:08,225 --> 01:47:10,810
He didn't even have a gun on him.

1332
01:47:13,688 --> 01:47:15,314
This time we have witnesses.

1333
01:47:15,607 --> 01:47:17,358
These guys will be locked up
for a long time.

1334
01:47:17,526 --> 01:47:19,318
Officer Chang! Get those people back.

1335
01:47:19,486 --> 01:47:22,530
You have to step back now, okay?

1336
01:47:41,383 --> 01:47:43,968
Get them the fuck out of here.
Get them out of here.

1337
01:49:22,651 --> 01:49:27,279
Walt Kowalski once said to me that I
didn't know anything about life or death...

1338
01:49:27,447 --> 01:49:31,909
...because I was an over-educated,
27-year-old virgin...

1339
01:49:32,077 --> 01:49:35,955
...who held the hands of superstitious old
women and promised them eternity.

1340
01:49:37,874 --> 01:49:40,751
Walt definitely had no problem
calling it like he saw it...

1341
01:49:41,503 --> 01:49:43,629
...but he was right.

1342
01:49:43,797 --> 01:49:48,968
I knew really nothing about life or death
until I got to know Walt.

1343
01:49:50,011 --> 01:49:52,054
And, boy, did I learn.

1344
01:49:58,687 --> 01:50:02,648
"And I wanna leave my house to the church
because Dorothy would've liked it."

1345
01:50:06,027 --> 01:50:08,612
Now, which brings us to our last item,
and again...

1346
01:50:08,780 --> 01:50:11,615
...please excuse the language
in Mr. Kowalski's will.

1347
01:50:11,783 --> 01:50:14,577
I'm simply reading it
the way it was written.

1348
01:50:15,996 --> 01:50:21,625
"And I'd like to leave
my 1 972 Gran Torino...

1349
01:50:26,172 --> 01:50:28,299
...to my friend...

1350
01:50:29,509 --> 01:50:32,845
...Thao Vang Lor...

1351
01:50:33,013 --> 01:50:37,182
...on the condition that you don't chop-top
the roof like one of those beaners...

1352
01:50:37,350 --> 01:50:42,438
...don't paint any idiotic flames on it
like some white-trash hillbilly...

1353
01:50:42,606 --> 01:50:45,065
...and don't put a big, gay spoiler
