00:03:27,728 --> 00:03:30,231
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome the man

3
00:03:30,314 --> 00:03:32,650
who knows what you're going
to do before you do it.

4
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:35,403
The amazing Frank Cadillac!

5
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:42,076
Here's to world peace.

6
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,920
Good evening. Welcome to
beautiful downtown Las Vegas.

7
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:56,841
How many people are here from
the Orient? Raise your hands.

8
00:03:57,425 --> 00:03:59,260
You, sir. Where are you from?

9
00:03:59,427 --> 00:04:01,178
No, wait! Wait. Don't tell me.

10
00:04:01,262 --> 00:04:04,265
I'm sensing you must have soul.

11
00:04:05,266 --> 00:04:06,934
You're a Seoul man.

12
00:04:07,268 --> 00:04:09,687
Why don't you share with
everyone where you're from?

13
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:11,772
- Korea.
- How about that, folks?

14
00:04:12,106 --> 00:04:15,943
And may I assume that this charming
young lady is your daughter?

15
00:04:16,527 --> 00:04:19,196
- She's my wife!
- Well, of course she is!

16
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,283
And what happens in
Vegas stays in Vegas.

17
00:04:22,533 --> 00:04:24,368
- What's your name?
- Yong Kyunge.

18
00:04:24,452 --> 00:04:25,786
Yong Kyunge.

19
00:04:25,953 --> 00:04:28,706
Would you be kind enough to
join me up on stage, please?

20
00:04:28,789 --> 00:04:31,625
Are you serious about
this guy? This a joke?

21
00:04:32,877 --> 00:04:35,296
Want me to round up some mimes
and clowns while we're at it?

22
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:37,465
Yong Kyunge, what if I told you

23
00:04:37,631 --> 00:04:40,051
that that pretty necklace you're
wearing has a broken catch,

24
00:04:40,134 --> 00:04:42,803
and on my count of three,
will fall into your drink?

25
00:04:42,928 --> 00:04:45,389
Wouldrt that be something?
Wouldrt that just blow your mind?

26
00:04:45,556 --> 00:04:46,557
- Yeah.
- Yes!

27
00:04:46,724 --> 00:04:48,726
Wouldrt it blow all your minds?

28
00:04:48,976 --> 00:04:51,604
Three, two, one, now.

29
00:04:53,981 --> 00:04:55,733
Did somebody say "spooky"?

30
00:04:56,484 --> 00:04:59,236
Wait a minute. Look at
your glass. Where'd it go?

31
00:05:00,154 --> 00:05:02,823
Yong Kyunge, why don't
you look inside my pocket?

32
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,700
Reach in. Dig deep.

33
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,496
Let's have a big hand for Yong Kyunge.

34
00:05:09,663 --> 00:05:12,583
That's magic, folks,
and that's why I'm here.

35
00:05:16,003 --> 00:05:18,339
You've probably seen
a lot of those shows.

36
00:05:18,422 --> 00:05:21,425
Mentalists. Magicians. Illusionists.

37
00:05:21,842 --> 00:05:24,595
You'd be shocked to know that sometimes,

38
00:05:24,762 --> 00:05:27,181
not often, but sometimes,

39
00:05:27,473 --> 00:05:29,141
it's the real deal.

40
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,268
Masquerading as an act.

41
00:05:31,602 --> 00:05:34,188
Hiding behind a few $50 tricks.

42
00:05:34,355 --> 00:05:35,981
Hiding in plain sight.

43
00:05:36,524 --> 00:05:39,235
Because if the magician doesn't do that,

44
00:05:39,402 --> 00:05:42,863
the alternative is impossible
for others to live with.

45
00:05:43,614 --> 00:05:47,368
Anyway, Wednesday night at the
Back Page doesn't pay very well,

46
00:05:47,451 --> 00:05:48,619
so I gamble.

47
00:05:48,786 --> 00:05:52,623
But I don't play against other
people. Only against the house.

48
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:00,131
So, no mega-jackpots, no long shots.

49
00:06:00,798 --> 00:06:02,883
The idea is to go unnoticed.

50
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,386
That way, I can keep coming back.

51
00:06:07,805 --> 00:06:09,306
I'm not a god.

52
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,642
I can't see everyone's future.

53
00:06:11,726 --> 00:06:13,144
Only my own.

54
00:06:13,227 --> 00:06:15,312
And only within two minutes.

55
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,648
Except for when I saw her.

56
00:06:17,732 --> 00:06:19,483
But we'll come back to that.

57
00:06:19,984 --> 00:06:21,819
There's no pattern to this
guy. He's all over the map.

58
00:06:21,902 --> 00:06:25,156
Well, he's not counting. Not
off the top of a five-deck shoe.

59
00:06:25,322 --> 00:06:26,824
Wait a minute.

60
00:06:27,074 --> 00:06:29,827
Isn't that that two-bit magic
act over at the Back Page?

61
00:06:29,994 --> 00:06:31,996
- What's his name?
- Cadillac.

62
00:06:33,164 --> 00:06:35,082
Yeah, that's Frank Cadillac.

63
00:06:35,249 --> 00:06:37,585
Is he pulling tricks
on us? Is that legal?

64
00:06:37,752 --> 00:06:39,670
You can't trick the deck.

65
00:06:40,421 --> 00:06:42,590
I'm telling you, that little
prick knows what's coming.

66
00:06:42,673 --> 00:06:44,842
If he's running that good a
system, why is he not betting more?

67
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:47,261
That's going to be my second question.

68
00:06:48,929 --> 00:06:50,848
Look at that. He's looking right at us.

69
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:52,933
It's like he can hear us.

70
00:06:53,017 --> 00:06:55,102
- What table was that?
- 27.

71
00:06:55,603 --> 00:06:58,272
This is Roybal. Give me two men
on table 27. I'm coming right down.

72
00:06:58,356 --> 00:07:00,274
Place your bets, please.

73
00:07:00,775 --> 00:07:03,194
Here's the thing about the future.

74
00:07:03,277 --> 00:07:04,862
Every time you look at it,

75
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:07,615
it changes because you looked at it.

76
00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:11,369
- Hi.
- And that changes everything else.

77
00:07:11,535 --> 00:07:14,538
$9,070.

78
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,542
Empty the drawer. Move!

79
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,379
Drop the gun! Now!

80
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:32,390
$9,070.

81
00:07:37,812 --> 00:07:39,814
Drop the gun! Step back!

82
00:07:40,231 --> 00:07:42,733
It's his gun. He was
going to shoot two people!

83
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,236
Step back. We'll settle this right now.

84
00:07:45,486 --> 00:07:47,071
What's he doing?

85
00:07:47,905 --> 00:07:52,076
Secure the doors, elevators, escalators,
every way out of this damn place! Now!

86
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:56,414
Freeman, seal off the blackjack
tables. Sullivan, link up with Roybal.

87
00:08:07,174 --> 00:08:09,593
We're on the floor.
On the floor right now.

88
00:08:09,677 --> 00:08:11,512
Bring up the other cameras.

89
00:08:15,516 --> 00:08:17,268
That way. This way.

90
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:35,453
He's right next to you.
$10 slots, aisle 14.

91
00:08:50,718 --> 00:08:54,305
There he is! Behind you!
Your left! Turn around!

92
00:08:54,472 --> 00:08:56,057
He's right between you!

93
00:09:01,896 --> 00:09:05,316
He's in the mens room near the
gift shop. Gift shop! Gift shop!

94
00:09:33,803 --> 00:09:35,888
Davis, where the hell is he?

95
00:09:37,765 --> 00:09:40,267
Black T-shirt, straw hat!
Heading towards the entrance!

96
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,936
Come on, let's go.

97
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:02,456
Call Vegas P.D.

98
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,209
Just stole a silver Charger, tag 585G4S.

99
00:11:50,147 --> 00:11:51,732
Drop the gun! Step back.

100
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:55,152
He rose to the top of our gambling
fraud wish list about two months ago.

101
00:11:55,236 --> 00:11:58,406
What he does has nothing to do
with luck. It's definable ability.

102
00:11:58,572 --> 00:12:00,908
Look at him. He knows exactly
what to do and not be caught.

103
00:12:00,991 --> 00:12:03,077
Can you explain that to me?

104
00:12:03,244 --> 00:12:06,247
No, I can't explain it,
Callie, nor do I have the time.

105
00:12:06,414 --> 00:12:09,667
The Russian Federation has
a 10-kiloton nuclear munition

106
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,669
- unaccounted for.
- I understand that.

107
00:12:11,752 --> 00:12:15,840
I'm not sure you do. We need every
agent available beating the street.

108
00:12:16,006 --> 00:12:19,927
That bomb was stolen five weeks ago.
We've just been informed of it now.

109
00:12:20,094 --> 00:12:22,930
Which means it could be parked
under this truck for all we know.

110
00:12:23,013 --> 00:12:25,099
I need actionable intelligence,

111
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:27,935
not paranormals and bullshit magicians.

112
00:12:28,102 --> 00:12:29,353
With all due respect, sir,

113
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,856
this bullshit magiciars shown
a pattern of advanced awareness

114
00:12:31,939 --> 00:12:33,441
that is statistically impossible.

115
00:12:33,524 --> 00:12:36,861
You let me bring him in and
you'll get what you want.

116
00:12:38,696 --> 00:12:40,865
Five days, Callie. That's it.

117
00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:47,204
Get me the head of casino security.

118
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,378
- You Roybal?
- It's Roybal.

119
00:12:54,462 --> 00:12:55,629
Whatever.

120
00:12:55,713 --> 00:12:58,382
- Who are you?
- Cavanaugh. Take a walk.

121
00:13:01,052 --> 00:13:04,305
Hey, Roybal, this isn't a
pissing contest. Come on.

122
00:13:16,067 --> 00:13:18,652
- What'd you do? You got a new car?
- Stole it.

123
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,405
Look at this.

124
00:13:21,906 --> 00:13:24,408
Twenty minutes to walk 20 steps.

125
00:13:24,492 --> 00:13:27,995
Well, that's what you
get from two packs a day.

126
00:13:28,162 --> 00:13:29,413
Oh, hey.

127
00:13:31,499 --> 00:13:34,085
- I got you two sandwiches.
- Two sandwiches?

128
00:13:34,835 --> 00:13:37,254
- That's 20 grand.
- Take it. I love you.

129
00:13:37,338 --> 00:13:38,756
Oh, jeez.

130
00:13:39,006 --> 00:13:40,758
How can I repay you?

131
00:13:43,844 --> 00:13:46,263
Must be a bitch to park this thing.

132
00:13:49,684 --> 00:13:52,269
Chief Roybal. Special Agent Ferris.

133
00:13:52,353 --> 00:13:53,938
I'm sure Agent Cavanaugh
has explained to you

134
00:13:54,021 --> 00:13:55,439
that everything you say
is admissible in court

135
00:13:55,523 --> 00:13:58,025
and anything you knowingly
admit can be used against you.

136
00:13:58,109 --> 00:14:00,194
Do we understand each other?

137
00:14:00,361 --> 00:14:01,362
Sure.

138
00:14:01,445 --> 00:14:03,864
- Tell me about Cris Johnson.
- I don't know who that is.

139
00:14:03,948 --> 00:14:05,116
How about Frank Cadillac?

140
00:14:05,282 --> 00:14:06,701
You chased him out of
your casino tonight.

141
00:14:06,784 --> 00:14:09,537
- He stole a car from valet parking.
- Yeah, I know Cadillac.

142
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,955
I thought he was cheating us at cards.

143
00:14:11,038 --> 00:14:12,790
Next thing I know, he's tackling
some guy and waving a gun.

144
00:14:12,957 --> 00:14:14,041
The gun wasn't his.

145
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,877
The man he tackled is wanted
for two casino killings in Reno.

146
00:14:17,044 --> 00:14:18,629
He's in custody now.

147
00:14:18,713 --> 00:14:20,965
Come on, I want to show you something.

148
00:14:22,049 --> 00:14:23,634
You remember this?

149
00:14:25,386 --> 00:14:28,139
Oh, yeah, of course I do. We were
saying he's looking right at us.

150
00:14:28,222 --> 00:14:30,808
- How'd you get this?
- Think carefully.

151
00:14:31,058 --> 00:14:33,144
What were you talking about
right when he looked up?

152
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,312
We were saying, if he has a
system, why isn't he betting more?

153
00:14:35,479 --> 00:14:37,648
You sure you weren't doing
or saying anything else?

154
00:14:37,815 --> 00:14:39,817
I was going down to pick him up,
I was reaching for my radio...

155
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,319
And right then? That's when
he looked up? Be very specific.

156
00:14:42,403 --> 00:14:43,821
That's what I said.

157
00:14:44,155 --> 00:14:45,656
He looked up, really.

158
00:14:47,825 --> 00:14:49,326
So he doesn't have to be there to do it.

159
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:52,079
Once you enter his
consciousness, he can pick it up.

160
00:14:52,246 --> 00:14:53,998
Is that to work his system?

161
00:14:54,081 --> 00:14:55,750
Thank you. We're finished.

162
00:15:00,421 --> 00:15:03,924
Done some good here, Mr. Roybal,
but none of it is up for discussion.

163
00:15:04,008 --> 00:15:07,011
Now, as far as you're concerned,
Cris Johnson never existed.

164
00:15:07,178 --> 00:15:10,848
That's going to be difficult considering
100 cameras saw him at the casino.

165
00:15:10,931 --> 00:15:13,517
Not to worry. Those
tapes have been destroyed.

166
00:15:14,268 --> 00:15:15,936
Hey. Is she single?

167
00:15:17,021 --> 00:15:20,858
Cris, you can't keep stealing
cars and having people chase you.

168
00:15:20,941 --> 00:15:22,693
That's not a life.

169
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,447
But you got to forget this girl
that you keep seeing in your head.

170
00:15:26,781 --> 00:15:28,783
I'm not going anywhere until I meet her.

171
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:31,202
Well, suppose she don't show up?

172
00:15:31,285 --> 00:15:34,789
She already did, at the diner. 8:09.

173
00:15:34,955 --> 00:15:38,042
Well, you got a couple hours.
How about a game of pool?

174
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,377
All right, Irv.

175
00:15:39,627 --> 00:15:41,462
We'll shoot some pool.

176
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:43,047
We timed every hand of blackjack.

177
00:15:43,214 --> 00:15:46,717
The longest was 89 seconds, when
Johnson pulled a six-card 21.

178
00:15:46,801 --> 00:15:49,720
So we know he can see at least
a minute and a half ahead.

179
00:15:49,804 --> 00:15:52,807
I had our techs run a radio
frequency spectrum analysis.

180
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:56,811
Came up dry, so he's not receiving
any form of electronic help.

181
00:15:57,228 --> 00:16:00,648
At one point, there was a
two-minute, 16-second delay.

182
00:16:00,981 --> 00:16:03,067
He never bet, just
got up and walked away.

183
00:16:03,234 --> 00:16:05,903
Well, maybe 2:16's too
long. He can't see that far.

184
00:16:05,986 --> 00:16:08,406
Narrows our window a little bit, anyway.

185
00:16:09,323 --> 00:16:12,827
Got him. Vegas P.D. Got a
LoJack hit on the stolen vehicle.

186
00:16:18,499 --> 00:16:19,750
Okay.

187
00:16:19,917 --> 00:16:21,752
Listen, about that girl.

188
00:16:22,169 --> 00:16:25,423
When you looked at the clock,
did you happen to see a calendar?

189
00:16:25,506 --> 00:16:29,593
Because it could be 10 years
from now she gets hungry.

190
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,512
It's got to be soon.

191
00:16:31,595 --> 00:16:34,265
I've never seen further
ahead than two minutes.

192
00:16:34,682 --> 00:16:36,017
Except for her.

193
00:16:36,183 --> 00:16:39,103
Now, what do you think
the reason is for that?

194
00:16:39,353 --> 00:16:42,106
I don't know. Maybe
she doesn't scare easy.

195
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,942
Maybe she's the one.

196
00:16:46,694 --> 00:16:50,781
Well, when you get like this
there's no talking to you.

197
00:16:52,366 --> 00:16:53,951
She's almost here.

198
00:16:54,618 --> 00:16:56,037
What happened to the diner?

199
00:16:56,203 --> 00:17:00,124
- Somebody else, a cop.
- A cop? Well, then, you got to go.

200
00:17:00,207 --> 00:17:03,794
Hold on. I want to see how much
she knows. What she wants from me.

201
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:07,798
Cris Johnson. Still here, huh?

202
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:08,966
Cris Johnson. Still here, huh?

203
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,968
Where else would I be?

204
00:17:11,302 --> 00:17:12,636
Special Agent Ferris.

205
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,972
Next time, steal a car without LoJack.

206
00:17:16,807 --> 00:17:18,726
Can we speak privately?

207
00:17:20,644 --> 00:17:22,146
It's okay, Irv.

208
00:17:22,313 --> 00:17:23,647
Go ahead. Thanks.

209
00:17:29,737 --> 00:17:31,655
I'm sure you know why I'm here.

210
00:17:32,073 --> 00:17:36,160
Because you're the man who knows what
I'm going to do before I do it, right?

211
00:17:37,828 --> 00:17:40,915
Oh, the show, right. Right!

212
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,084
I saw you there.

213
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,669
Wonderful. You like magic tricks.

214
00:17:45,753 --> 00:17:49,757
Yeah, yeah, I do like your
magic tricks, clairvoyance...

215
00:17:50,007 --> 00:17:51,759
Whatever you're calling it.

216
00:17:52,343 --> 00:17:54,428
Let's talk about something hard.

217
00:17:54,512 --> 00:17:57,515
A stolen nuclear munition is being
smuggled into the United States,

218
00:17:57,598 --> 00:18:00,059
or may, in fact, already be here.

219
00:18:01,727 --> 00:18:05,439
I want you to look ahead and tell
me where it's going to be deployed.

220
00:18:08,693 --> 00:18:13,030
I think you've got the
wrong guy. It's a magic act.

221
00:18:13,364 --> 00:18:15,282
You going to stick with that story?

222
00:18:15,366 --> 00:18:17,284
Because millions of lives are at risk

223
00:18:17,451 --> 00:18:20,538
and you could, maybe,
prevent a major catastrophe.

224
00:18:25,126 --> 00:18:27,962
On a practical note, we're standing
in front of a stolen vehicle

225
00:18:28,129 --> 00:18:31,090
and you are wanted for assault
involving a weapon at the casino.

226
00:18:31,132 --> 00:18:33,175
All right, that was an
accident. He had a gun.

227
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,970
- He was going to shoot two people.
- Yeah?

228
00:18:37,972 --> 00:18:39,724
How'd you know that?

229
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:48,065
No good deed goes unpunished, does it?

230
00:18:48,983 --> 00:18:51,652
I can fix your legal problems,
buddy, but you've got to step up.

231
00:18:51,777 --> 00:18:56,115
Otherwise, your next magic show is
going to be at Folsom State Prison.

232
00:18:57,992 --> 00:19:02,413
It's ironic, but people
like you who try to help

233
00:19:02,997 --> 00:19:07,418
have been torturing me, in the full sense
of the word, since I was three years old.

234
00:19:08,836 --> 00:19:10,588
What did they call it?

235
00:19:10,921 --> 00:19:12,173
Oh, yeah.

236
00:19:12,256 --> 00:19:14,884
Observed play therapy.

237
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:18,345
Featuring the marathon, 36-hour,

238
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:21,140
can-you-guess-the-next-flash-card
game.

239
00:19:22,683 --> 00:19:25,436
So, please, leave me alone

240
00:19:26,062 --> 00:19:29,023
and let me live some
semblance of a normal life.

241
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,817
I'd love to indulge your feelings,

242
00:19:31,942 --> 00:19:34,612
but I am dealing with a slightly
larger picture right now.

243
00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:37,656
Now, you can exercise your
responsibility to help your fellow man

244
00:19:37,782 --> 00:19:40,451
or I will exercise that
responsibility for you.

245
00:19:49,001 --> 00:19:51,045
You're right. I got to go.

246
00:20:07,228 --> 00:20:08,813
He's gone, right?

247
00:20:11,315 --> 00:20:13,734
I missed him by seconds, didn't I?

248
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,327
Excuse me, honey, can
you get off my car?

249
00:20:23,494 --> 00:20:25,579
Yeah, thank you. Jeez.

250
00:20:25,913 --> 00:20:28,916
- Mr. Roybal?
- It's Roybal. Can I help you, man?

251
00:20:28,999 --> 00:20:31,919
I have a few questions
if this is a good time.

252
00:20:33,254 --> 00:20:34,672
Gaming Commission? It's after hours.

253
00:20:34,755 --> 00:20:37,007
You guys should be at a
strip club, right? Come on.

254
00:20:37,174 --> 00:20:39,844
What can you tell us about Cris Johnson?

255
00:20:42,763 --> 00:20:45,349
I don't know who you're talking about.

256
00:20:58,029 --> 00:21:00,197
Let me rephrase the question.

257
00:21:09,123 --> 00:21:10,374
It's destiny.

258
00:22:27,618 --> 00:22:29,620
- Here you go, hon.
- Thanks.

259
00:22:41,132 --> 00:22:42,466
Excuse me.

260
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,718
Hello.

261
00:22:45,636 --> 00:22:48,723
I noticed you were alone,
too. Do you mind if I join you?

262
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,891
Actually, I do.

263
00:23:08,743 --> 00:23:12,163
Sorry to bother you, but I have
a question about the coffee.

264
00:23:12,413 --> 00:23:13,914
The bean they use...

265
00:23:14,081 --> 00:23:17,251
Isn't that something you should
probably ask your waitress?

266
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:19,587
Yes, it is.

267
00:23:27,178 --> 00:23:29,180
Excuse me, do you have a light?

268
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:31,432
I don't smoke.

269
00:23:32,767 --> 00:23:34,769
- Here you go, hon.
- Thanks.

270
00:23:37,271 --> 00:23:38,356
Please.

271
00:23:38,856 --> 00:23:39,857
Don't.

272
00:23:57,291 --> 00:23:58,542
Hey, Liz.

273
00:23:58,876 --> 00:24:00,211
Did you follow me here, Kendall?

274
00:24:00,294 --> 00:24:02,880
No! No, I just thought we could talk.

275
00:24:04,048 --> 00:24:06,217
You know, we got really
nothing to talk about.

276
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,302
And I told you that three weeks ago.

277
00:24:08,386 --> 00:24:12,640
Liz, come on, all right? I had an
off day. Just give me another shot.

278
00:24:13,724 --> 00:24:16,727
It's not gonna happen. Okay?
So maybe you should just go.

279
00:24:16,811 --> 00:24:19,313
Do you know how hard it was to find you?

280
00:24:19,647 --> 00:24:22,233
I was at your apartment. I
tried the Starbucks on Lexington.

281
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,485
I was at the dry cleaner.
All I am asking for

282
00:24:24,652 --> 00:24:28,406
is a few minutes of your time
so that we can work things out.

283
00:24:29,323 --> 00:24:32,326
- Okay, Jesus, you are stalking me now.
- Don't!

284
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:36,247
Don't say that, please. That's a
terrible thing to say to somebody.

285
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:37,832
Let go of me, Kendall.

286
00:24:37,998 --> 00:24:40,668
Look, I just... I thought we could
talk, maybe we could take a drive.

287
00:24:40,751 --> 00:24:41,919
And now you are ruining it.

288
00:24:42,002 --> 00:24:43,087
You're hurting me.

289
00:24:43,254 --> 00:24:45,840
Kendall, I think you're
having another off day.

290
00:24:46,006 --> 00:24:48,592
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm her future.

291
00:24:49,427 --> 00:24:50,344
Really?

292
00:24:53,848 --> 00:24:55,850
Hi, my name's Cris.

293
00:24:59,353 --> 00:25:00,688
You okay, Kendall?

294
00:25:04,108 --> 00:25:08,029
See, the thing is, I feel connected
to you. I don't know the reason why.

295
00:25:08,863 --> 00:25:11,449
- See, now, listen.
- All right.

296
00:25:11,699 --> 00:25:14,952
I think it's only fair that you
pay for the lady's breakfast.

297
00:25:16,037 --> 00:25:18,789
What are you having?
Pecan pie is amazing.

298
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:23,210
Excuse me, I can pay
for my own breakfast.

299
00:25:23,294 --> 00:25:24,545
And you know what?

300
00:25:24,712 --> 00:25:26,630
You two work things out.

301
00:25:27,465 --> 00:25:28,549
Okay.

302
00:25:30,468 --> 00:25:31,469
You're hurting me.

303
00:25:31,635 --> 00:25:34,138
Kendall, I think you're
having another off day.

304
00:25:34,221 --> 00:25:36,474
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm her future.

305
00:25:37,391 --> 00:25:38,309
Really?

306
00:25:38,726 --> 00:25:39,894
Incoming.

307
00:25:41,562 --> 00:25:42,897
Did you see that?

308
00:25:43,397 --> 00:25:44,648
Goddamn it! Kendall!

309
00:25:44,732 --> 00:25:46,984
What? Don't blame me.
This is your fault.

310
00:25:47,151 --> 00:25:50,404
Get out of here! Will
somebody please call the cops?

311
00:25:51,072 --> 00:25:51,739
I am so sorry.

312
00:25:51,739 --> 00:25:52,490
I am so sorry.

313
00:25:52,823 --> 00:25:55,076
Are you okay? Let me help you.

314
00:25:55,493 --> 00:25:57,995
Come on, let's get you cleaned up.

315
00:25:58,913 --> 00:26:00,164
Come on.

316
00:26:03,584 --> 00:26:04,668
Okay.

317
00:26:07,088 --> 00:26:09,340
Oh, yeah, I'm seeing some stars.

318
00:26:09,924 --> 00:26:10,925
Yeah.

319
00:26:12,176 --> 00:26:13,344
I'm Liz.

320
00:26:13,928 --> 00:26:15,012
Cris.

321
00:26:16,263 --> 00:26:19,517
You must have a death wish
getting involved in that.

322
00:26:19,767 --> 00:26:21,185
Here. Just...

323
00:26:21,769 --> 00:26:23,187
- Okay.
- Just...

324
00:26:23,938 --> 00:26:26,023
Okay, hold it there for a little bit.

325
00:26:26,107 --> 00:26:27,525
- Okay.
- Yeah.

326
00:26:34,198 --> 00:26:35,533
It will.

327
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:39,453
- What will?
- Your luck. It's going to change.

328
00:26:40,871 --> 00:26:42,873
What are you? A leprechaun?

329
00:26:49,296 --> 00:26:53,050
Do leprechauns get punched in
the face or have their car stolen?

330
00:26:53,134 --> 00:26:54,885
Your car was stolen?

331
00:26:55,052 --> 00:26:57,638
Yeah. I'm hoping they find it today.

332
00:26:59,223 --> 00:27:01,559
I'm supposed to be in Flagstaff.

333
00:27:03,978 --> 00:27:06,230
Hey, is this tooth loose here?

334
00:27:08,065 --> 00:27:10,317
I don't know. I don't think so.

335
00:27:11,569 --> 00:27:12,653
Hurts.

336
00:27:15,489 --> 00:27:17,241
Well, listen, maybe I
could give you a ride,

337
00:27:17,324 --> 00:27:18,909
and I'm kind of going that way.

338
00:27:19,076 --> 00:27:22,329
That would really be
helpful, Liz. Thank you.

339
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:24,832
Well, I do have to make a stop, though.

340
00:27:24,999 --> 00:27:26,167
It's okay.

341
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:29,587
And it might take a few hours,
so if you're cool with that.

342
00:27:29,754 --> 00:27:33,257
Hey, look, if you're
uncomfortable with this,

343
00:27:34,175 --> 00:27:36,093
- I'll take the bus.
- No, no, no.

344
00:27:36,177 --> 00:27:38,929
It's fine, it's fine.
You're not a psycho.

345
00:27:41,182 --> 00:27:42,266
Right?

346
00:27:43,017 --> 00:27:45,770
Because the first psycho vibe
I get, you're out of the car.

347
00:27:45,853 --> 00:27:47,938
- Okay. Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.

348
00:27:49,023 --> 00:27:50,107
Deal.

349
00:27:51,776 --> 00:27:52,860
Deal.

350
00:28:02,787 --> 00:28:04,622
It's amazing, isn't it?

351
00:28:04,705 --> 00:28:06,791
I end up in a diner where you are,

352
00:28:07,541 --> 00:28:10,044
and we're both headed
in the same direction.

353
00:28:11,712 --> 00:28:13,631
I don't know if I would
call it amazing, but...

354
00:28:13,714 --> 00:28:14,965
Destiny.

355
00:28:15,466 --> 00:28:17,134
That's what it really is.

356
00:28:18,052 --> 00:28:20,554
Okay, I'm starting to
get that psycho vibe.

357
00:28:20,721 --> 00:28:23,557
Oh no. You don't believe in destiny?

358
00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:27,311
Well, even if it does exist,

359
00:28:27,645 --> 00:28:29,313
I don't think I want to know.

360
00:28:29,397 --> 00:28:32,733
I mean, if every move
we make is preordained,

361
00:28:33,067 --> 00:28:34,151
then what is the point of that?

362
00:28:34,235 --> 00:28:37,071
I mean, life is supposed
to be a surprise.

363
00:28:38,072 --> 00:28:39,323
Isn't it?

364
00:28:40,908 --> 00:28:42,493
It would be nice.

365
00:28:45,413 --> 00:28:46,497
Yeah.

366
00:28:47,581 --> 00:28:48,666
Yeah.

367
00:28:56,257 --> 00:28:59,844
So he came in twice a day
for a week at exactly 8:09?

368
00:28:59,927 --> 00:29:03,431
Yeah, he'd stay a few minutes,
have a martini, and then he'd go.

369
00:29:03,514 --> 00:29:05,099
Till today, when he met that lady.

370
00:29:05,182 --> 00:29:07,685
You didn't find anything
strange about that?

371
00:29:07,935 --> 00:29:09,437
Not strange enough to call the police.

372
00:29:09,603 --> 00:29:11,355
We got a regular that counts
the corn flakes in his bowl

373
00:29:11,522 --> 00:29:12,690
because it has to be an even number.

374
00:29:12,857 --> 00:29:14,108
Got any cameras?

375
00:29:14,191 --> 00:29:15,860
Inside? No.

376
00:29:16,027 --> 00:29:17,194
Outside?

377
00:29:18,529 --> 00:29:19,530
No.

378
00:29:19,613 --> 00:29:21,532
Did you notice what kind
of car he was driving?

379
00:29:21,615 --> 00:29:23,200
Maybe overhear where they were going?

380
00:29:23,367 --> 00:29:25,453
I don't know what car, but they
were headed up to Flagstaff.

381
00:29:25,536 --> 00:29:27,455
- Flagstaff.
- That's what they said.

382
00:29:27,621 --> 00:29:29,373
Got another regular,
she's always on a diet.

383
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,709
Brings in a scale and
her own salad dressing.

384
00:29:31,792 --> 00:29:33,961
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

385
00:29:35,963 --> 00:29:38,966
Guy knows we're after him,
but he still risks coming here.

386
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:41,385
- 8:09, twice a day.
- Doesrt even know if it's day or night.

387
00:29:41,552 --> 00:29:43,804
Just the time. He was waiting for her.

388
00:29:43,971 --> 00:29:45,556
All right, there's a
traffic cam over there,

389
00:29:45,723 --> 00:29:47,141
a bank, a 7-Eleven across the street.

390
00:29:47,308 --> 00:29:49,977
Just run all the tapes. Maybe we'll
get lucky and catch him in wide.

391
00:29:50,144 --> 00:29:52,063
Your buddy Roybal, the casino chief?

392
00:29:52,229 --> 00:29:54,565
Had his throat cut last night
after getting a kneecap shot off.

393
00:29:54,648 --> 00:29:57,234
You're telling me this now? We
just talked to him about Johnson.

394
00:29:57,401 --> 00:29:59,487
- Hey, I just found out.
- All right.

395
00:30:00,488 --> 00:30:02,323
- Local weapon?
- Dead end.

396
00:30:02,406 --> 00:30:04,992
And forensics came up empty.
Not a hair, not a fiber.

397
00:30:05,076 --> 00:30:06,243
Somebody wants information.

398
00:30:06,327 --> 00:30:08,412
Now, the next time anything
happens relative to Johnson,

399
00:30:08,496 --> 00:30:09,747
I want to know right away.

400
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:11,499
I don't care if it's a paper cut.

401
00:30:11,665 --> 00:30:13,000
Okay, boss.

402
00:30:35,106 --> 00:30:37,024
That's good! Good. Right there!

403
00:31:37,918 --> 00:31:41,005
The head of casino security,
what did you learn from him?

404
00:31:41,589 --> 00:31:44,091
For a macho guy, he screams like a girl.

405
00:31:44,258 --> 00:31:47,261
But he was questioned by federal
agents looking for Cris Johnson,

406
00:31:47,428 --> 00:31:48,429
yes?

407
00:31:48,512 --> 00:31:51,015
He said they haven't found him yet.

408
00:31:51,766 --> 00:31:53,434
Do you believe this shit?

409
00:31:54,268 --> 00:31:56,771
He can see things before they happen?

410
00:31:57,605 --> 00:32:00,191
It makes no difference what I believe.

411
00:32:00,608 --> 00:32:03,277
Look, we spent two years setting this up

412
00:32:03,444 --> 00:32:05,279
and that man out there is
worried all this will be

413
00:32:05,446 --> 00:32:07,281
compromised by Johnson.

414
00:32:07,948 --> 00:32:11,118
We're wasting our time
looking for some magician.

415
00:32:11,786 --> 00:32:14,205
We're being paid to secure
the operation, Jones,

416
00:32:14,288 --> 00:32:16,374
not to hunt down some carnival barker.

417
00:32:16,457 --> 00:32:19,043
Really? Then why are
the same authorities

418
00:32:19,126 --> 00:32:22,046
that are looking for
us so interested in him?

419
00:32:24,715 --> 00:32:26,217
Get rid of him.

420
00:32:27,385 --> 00:32:28,719
Do it now.

421
00:32:54,662 --> 00:32:55,663
Hey.

422
00:32:56,997 --> 00:32:59,750
Havasupai Reservation.
I teach here once a week.

423
00:33:00,251 --> 00:33:02,253
The conditions are pretty lousy.

424
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:05,589
But it's in the Canyon, one of
the Eight Wonders of the World.

425
00:33:05,673 --> 00:33:07,091
- Hey, Sam.
- Hey, Liz.

426
00:33:07,174 --> 00:33:09,760
Well, a couple hundred years
ago, this tribe was booming.

427
00:33:09,844 --> 00:33:13,431
Plenty of food and a thriving
culture. They should be better off.

428
00:33:13,514 --> 00:33:16,183
But I guess this was just their destiny.

429
00:33:16,851 --> 00:33:18,936
I'd like to meet their shaman.

430
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,856
I read once that in many
North American tribes

431
00:33:21,939 --> 00:33:24,275
their shamars purpose wasrt only healing

432
00:33:24,442 --> 00:33:27,278
but they also claimed to have
power over the atmosphere.

433
00:33:27,361 --> 00:33:29,864
To bring on or stop rain.

434
00:33:31,699 --> 00:33:33,701
Even know future events.

435
00:33:34,368 --> 00:33:35,119
Do you think that's possible?

436
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:35,870
Do you think that's possible?

437
00:33:36,037 --> 00:33:38,205
Well, I believe anything is possible.

438
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,791
Me, too.

439
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:51,385
- Whose birthday?
- One of my students'.

440
00:33:53,137 --> 00:33:54,889
Hey! Hi!

441
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:57,391
How's it going?

442
00:33:57,725 --> 00:34:00,227
Hello! How is everybody? Good?

443
00:34:10,154 --> 00:34:12,740
- That's good.
- Oh, I was close.

444
00:34:12,823 --> 00:34:14,825
That was a lot. You
messed up on the last part.

445
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:16,827
On the last part. Yeah.

446
00:34:17,078 --> 00:34:19,330
I thought you werert coming
back until next Monday.

447
00:34:19,413 --> 00:34:22,833
Well, I'm not, but it's Jake's
birthday. How could I miss that?

448
00:34:22,917 --> 00:34:24,668
Who's that man you're with?

449
00:34:25,169 --> 00:34:26,921
Is he your boyfriend?

450
00:34:27,088 --> 00:34:29,924
No, no, he's not my
boyfriend. He's just my friend.

451
00:34:30,424 --> 00:34:31,926
I think he likes you.

452
00:34:33,761 --> 00:34:35,346
Well, why would you say that?

453
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:38,933
Because he looked at you like my
brother looks at his girlfriend.

454
00:34:55,866 --> 00:34:58,285
Hey, Jake, you want to see some magic?

455
00:34:58,452 --> 00:35:00,287
I'll show you something. Come here.

456
00:35:00,454 --> 00:35:02,289
I found this rock out in the Canyon

457
00:35:02,373 --> 00:35:04,709
and I want you to hold it
because it's a magic rock.

458
00:35:04,792 --> 00:35:08,045
That's right. Hold it
really tight. Keep squeezing.

459
00:35:09,296 --> 00:35:10,631
It's magic.

460
00:35:16,053 --> 00:35:17,555
He won't bite.

461
00:35:17,638 --> 00:35:19,140
Happy birthday.

462
00:35:23,144 --> 00:35:24,729
So, you're a magician?

463
00:35:25,479 --> 00:35:26,480
Well...

464
00:35:27,148 --> 00:35:29,817
I have a small magic act back in Vegas.

465
00:35:30,151 --> 00:35:31,819
The Frank Cadillac Show.

466
00:35:32,653 --> 00:35:34,739
- I thought your name was Cris.
- It is.

467
00:35:34,822 --> 00:35:36,907
Frank Cadillac is my stage name.

468
00:35:37,491 --> 00:35:39,410
How did you come up with that?

469
00:35:40,286 --> 00:35:43,581
I picked two things I really
liked and I put them together.

470
00:35:43,831 --> 00:35:45,916
Frankenstein and Cadillacs.

471
00:35:47,918 --> 00:35:49,253
You are odd.

472
00:35:50,004 --> 00:35:51,255
Charming,

473
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,090
but odd.

474
00:36:02,183 --> 00:36:04,518
Cease fire! Visitor on the range!

475
00:36:06,187 --> 00:36:07,188
Nice.

476
00:36:07,772 --> 00:36:09,482
A little close, though.

477
00:36:12,693 --> 00:36:13,861
Okay.

478
00:36:14,862 --> 00:36:18,032
You were right about the traffic
cam. We got a positive ID.

479
00:36:40,638 --> 00:36:41,889
I'm sorry.

480
00:36:42,723 --> 00:36:43,808
Don't be.

481
00:36:44,642 --> 00:36:45,810
It's okay.

482
00:36:48,229 --> 00:36:49,480
Did I drool?

483
00:36:49,897 --> 00:36:51,065
- Drool?
- Yeah.

484
00:36:51,315 --> 00:36:52,566
Drool? No.

485
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:59,073
Oh, my God, it's coming down so hard.

486
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,324
Yeah.

487
00:37:01,742 --> 00:37:03,202
I like rain.

488
00:37:06,497 --> 00:37:08,124
I like rain, too.

489
00:37:10,167 --> 00:37:13,254
You know, once, I
think it was in Denmark,

490
00:37:13,671 --> 00:37:15,256
it rained fish.

491
00:37:15,339 --> 00:37:18,009
Because the sun dehydrated the water

492
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:20,177
and took it up into the atmosphere,

493
00:37:20,636 --> 00:37:24,098
rehydrated the fish
eggs and they hatched

494
00:37:24,557 --> 00:37:26,350
and it rained fish.

495
00:37:26,684 --> 00:37:27,852
Is that true?

496
00:37:27,935 --> 00:37:31,522
Yeah, in the clouds. True
story. It happened 50 years ago.

497
00:37:33,107 --> 00:37:35,526
I just felt like sharing that with you.

498
00:37:45,286 --> 00:37:47,496
Road's washed out ahead.
You can't cross till morning.

499
00:37:47,621 --> 00:37:49,081
Not even then if this keeps up.

500
00:37:49,123 --> 00:37:50,958
You want to spin around
and go back about two miles,

501
00:37:51,042 --> 00:37:53,294
take your second left. There'll
be a motel there called...

502
00:37:53,461 --> 00:37:55,129
"The Cliffhanger." Thanks.

503
00:37:56,464 --> 00:37:57,548
Right.

504
00:38:06,307 --> 00:38:07,475
Him, right?

505
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,686
That's it?

506
00:38:11,645 --> 00:38:14,357
There's no front plate.
Where's the other side?

507
00:38:15,399 --> 00:38:16,734
I don't have it.

508
00:38:17,485 --> 00:38:19,570
What was that on the
front window? Go back.

509
00:38:19,653 --> 00:38:20,988
Back, back.

510
00:38:21,489 --> 00:38:23,491
Back. There! Zoom in.

511
00:38:28,245 --> 00:38:29,830
That's a permit.

512
00:38:29,997 --> 00:38:31,916
Track it and find her.

513
00:38:40,508 --> 00:38:42,176
I'll light a fire.

514
00:38:52,853 --> 00:38:54,772
Cris, one little problem.

515
00:38:56,107 --> 00:38:58,943
Oh, no, no, I'm going
to sleep in the car.

516
00:39:04,115 --> 00:39:05,116
Okay.

517
00:39:06,617 --> 00:39:07,618
Here.

518
00:39:08,577 --> 00:39:10,121
- Thanks.
- Sure.

519
00:39:11,038 --> 00:39:14,875
Hey, did you hear the joke about the
Zen master who ordered the hot dog?

520
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:16,711
No.

521
00:39:17,378 --> 00:39:19,964
He said he'd have one with everything.

522
00:39:23,551 --> 00:39:24,969
Good night.

523
00:39:25,553 --> 00:39:26,887
Good night.

524
00:40:23,527 --> 00:40:24,945
What do we have?

525
00:40:25,029 --> 00:40:27,698
They're at the Cliffhanger
Motel outside Flagstaff.

526
00:40:27,823 --> 00:40:30,618
We found an Arizona DOT foreman
who remembered the Land Cruiser.

527
00:40:30,701 --> 00:40:31,869
Why would he do that?

528
00:40:31,952 --> 00:40:35,706
The road was flooded. He was
about to suggest a place to stay.

529
00:40:36,123 --> 00:40:38,042
But Johnson already knew. Right?

530
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:39,377
Exactly.

531
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,712
Callie. It just got worse.

532
00:40:45,549 --> 00:40:48,052
All right, people, we've
got a nuclear alert.

533
00:40:48,219 --> 00:40:52,056
Code Red, in the Southern
California region. L.A. To San Diego.

534
00:40:52,139 --> 00:40:53,891
95% certainty.

535
00:40:54,058 --> 00:40:57,561
Nuclear emergency search teams are
on the way, but until they get here,

536
00:40:57,728 --> 00:41:01,565
can somebody please tell me what my
agency, the FBI, is doing about it?

537
00:41:01,691 --> 00:41:04,652
Sir, tier-one suspects
have been interrogated.

538
00:41:04,819 --> 00:41:07,071
Cars and premises have been
checked, friends and acquaintances.

539
00:41:07,196 --> 00:41:09,573
We've opened up surveillance
on tier-two and three suspects,

540
00:41:09,657 --> 00:41:10,825
but nothing actionable yet.

541
00:41:10,991 --> 00:41:13,452
Oh, is that what we're doing,
waiting for something actionable?

542
00:41:13,577 --> 00:41:15,913
There are eight million lives
that are precarious at best.

543
00:41:16,038 --> 00:41:17,998
I say we widen the net
to "slightly suspicious"

544
00:41:18,124 --> 00:41:22,044
and get some decent intel before
this nuke blows up Los Angeles.

545
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,921
All right, Callie.

546
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:26,340
What do you propose we do next?

547
00:41:26,674 --> 00:41:28,426
I believe that the
urgency of this situation

548
00:41:28,509 --> 00:41:31,512
compels the use of any and all
resources to obtain Cris Johnson.

549
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:34,557
We know where he is.
Let my team pick him up.

550
00:41:47,445 --> 00:41:49,155
He said they're mobilizing.

551
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,283
Standard procedure when
security is escalated.

552
00:41:53,034 --> 00:41:54,618
Tell him to wrap it up.

553
00:41:54,785 --> 00:41:56,954
They'll lead us straight to Johnson.

554
00:42:15,973 --> 00:42:18,601
You hungry? There's a
coffee shop down the road.

555
00:42:18,726 --> 00:42:20,936
I'd rather eat here, if that's okay.

556
00:42:21,228 --> 00:42:22,271
Sure.

557
00:42:32,948 --> 00:42:33,991
What?

558
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:42,750
There's an Italian
painter named Carlotti,

559
00:42:46,504 --> 00:42:48,047
and he defined beauty.

560
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:51,759
He said it was the
summation of the parts

561
00:42:52,677 --> 00:42:54,845
working together in such a way

562
00:42:55,346 --> 00:42:59,350
that nothing needed to be
added, taken away or altered.

563
00:43:00,768 --> 00:43:02,103
That's you.

564
00:43:05,022 --> 00:43:06,691
You're beautiful.

565
00:43:11,112 --> 00:43:12,113
Wow.

566
00:43:23,124 --> 00:43:24,625
That was incredible.

567
00:43:26,127 --> 00:43:27,378
What was?

568
00:43:29,005 --> 00:43:30,047
This.

569
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:54,488
Right here gives us a
good standoff position

570
00:43:54,572 --> 00:43:56,073
and open view of the front of the motel.

571
00:43:56,157 --> 00:43:58,075
We can run multiple point
and area surveillances

572
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:00,077
from this road here, that turn out.

573
00:44:00,161 --> 00:44:01,829
Get a team with a
parabolic set right here.

574
00:44:01,912 --> 00:44:04,248
That's fine, but I also
want mobile surveillance.

575
00:44:04,415 --> 00:44:05,499
And give me two or three roamers.

576
00:44:05,666 --> 00:44:07,835
If he rabbits on us,
I want to be flexible.

577
00:44:08,002 --> 00:44:09,128
Ferris.

578
00:44:11,672 --> 00:44:13,424
Call the local police in Flagstaff.

579
00:44:13,549 --> 00:44:15,009
Tell them to hold the outside perimeter.

580
00:44:15,134 --> 00:44:17,261
I want that area locked down.

581
00:44:18,095 --> 00:44:19,555
A body turned up in an apartment

582
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,390
with a line of sight to my office.

583
00:44:21,515 --> 00:44:23,434
Slit throat, like Roybal.

584
00:44:23,476 --> 00:44:26,270
Somebody's trying to
follow us to Johnson.

585
00:44:40,785 --> 00:44:41,869
Cris.

586
00:44:43,954 --> 00:44:44,955
Yeah.

587
00:44:47,708 --> 00:44:50,461
Maybe there is such a thing as destiny.

588
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:26,831
Give it 40 seconds.

589
00:45:33,504 --> 00:45:35,756
So, after two minutes, he just
stops seeing what's going to happen?

590
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,758
I sure as hell hope so.

591
00:45:56,444 --> 00:45:58,029
Elizabeth Cooper?

592
00:45:58,529 --> 00:46:00,531
- Yeah.
- Federal Agent Ferris.

593
00:46:03,701 --> 00:46:04,952
What is this about?

594
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:07,621
I'm going to need a few
minutes of your time.

595
00:46:13,794 --> 00:46:15,212
Yeah, okay.

596
00:46:26,223 --> 00:46:28,142
They're putting her in the car.

597
00:46:33,647 --> 00:46:35,483
Drop the gun! Step back.

598
00:46:36,484 --> 00:46:39,487
It's his gun. He was
going to shoot two people!

599
00:46:46,243 --> 00:46:47,411
This was three days ago?

600
00:46:47,495 --> 00:46:49,914
He used you to get
away from us in Vegas.

601
00:46:50,081 --> 00:46:52,583
You can be pretty sure that
everything he told you is a lie.

602
00:46:52,666 --> 00:46:54,919
He's delusional. A sociopath.

603
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,092
Oh, my God.

604
00:47:02,343 --> 00:47:03,761
Oh, my God.

605
00:47:04,595 --> 00:47:05,763
Oh, shit.

606
00:47:06,847 --> 00:47:08,099
Oh, shit.

607
00:47:10,017 --> 00:47:11,769
Go back to the motel.

608
00:47:12,019 --> 00:47:14,939
Have a drink. Put one
of these in his glass.

609
00:47:15,106 --> 00:47:16,691
It'll take five minutes
to put him to sleep.

610
00:47:16,774 --> 00:47:18,109
Then we'll come in and get him.

611
00:47:18,275 --> 00:47:19,276
Nobody's been hurt.

612
00:47:19,443 --> 00:47:20,611
But this is important.

613
00:47:20,695 --> 00:47:22,697
You need to do it at least two minutes

614
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:25,116
after you get him out of the room.

615
00:47:28,703 --> 00:47:31,789
Why do you need me? Why
can't you just get him?

616
00:47:32,123 --> 00:47:35,626
Liz, as I understand it, you work
for a federally funded program

617
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:38,546
teaching on various
reservations. Is that true?

618
00:47:40,214 --> 00:47:41,799
Yes, that's true.

619
00:47:41,966 --> 00:47:44,468
Well, I'd think you'd
be eager to help us.

620
00:47:44,635 --> 00:47:46,554
We're on the same team.

621
00:48:01,902 --> 00:48:03,988
Now they're letting her go.

622
00:48:23,591 --> 00:48:24,675
Hey.

623
00:48:24,759 --> 00:48:25,843
Hey.

624
00:48:26,177 --> 00:48:27,845
Thanks for the note.

625
00:48:27,928 --> 00:48:29,096
Sure.

626
00:48:29,263 --> 00:48:31,349
- Did you have a nice walk?
- I did.

627
00:48:31,515 --> 00:48:34,018
You know, it's really beautiful here.

628
00:48:36,771 --> 00:48:39,023
I have a present for you.

629
00:48:41,108 --> 00:48:42,693
Oh, thanks.

630
00:48:43,527 --> 00:48:45,279
- I need that.
- Yeah.

631
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:04,382
Is something wrong?

632
00:49:05,383 --> 00:49:07,134
Oh, no, no, I'm fine.

633
00:49:07,551 --> 00:49:10,554
Why don't you go wash up and
I'm gonna make us breakfast?

634
00:49:10,721 --> 00:49:12,056
- Okay.
- Okay.

635
00:50:03,441 --> 00:50:04,942
45 seconds.

636
00:50:30,051 --> 00:50:31,802
One minute, thirty.

637
00:50:59,997 --> 00:51:01,916
And that's two.

638
00:51:17,515 --> 00:51:19,517
- Looks good.
- You think so?

639
00:51:20,434 --> 00:51:21,602
Thank you.

640
00:51:33,864 --> 00:51:35,449
Don't drink that!

641
00:51:36,117 --> 00:51:37,535
It's drugged.

642
00:51:37,952 --> 00:51:39,787
Oh, God, I don't know what I'm doing.

643
00:51:39,954 --> 00:51:41,872
I have no idea what I'm doing.

644
00:51:41,956 --> 00:51:44,542
Some federal agent
came up to me and said

645
00:51:44,709 --> 00:51:47,628
that you were a delusional
sociopath and showed me this tape.

646
00:51:47,795 --> 00:51:49,380
So maybe you are.

647
00:51:49,547 --> 00:51:50,715
But I don't want to believe that.

648
00:51:50,798 --> 00:51:52,550
I don't think I can believe that.

649
00:51:52,633 --> 00:51:54,802
And she also said that if you ran,

650
00:51:54,969 --> 00:51:56,721
they would shoot you.

651
00:51:57,304 --> 00:51:59,473
So I should drug you instead.

652
00:52:00,224 --> 00:52:03,310
Even if what they said is
true, I don't want you to die.

653
00:52:03,894 --> 00:52:05,896
I don't want you to die.

654
00:52:10,401 --> 00:52:12,069
Cris, is it true?

655
00:52:17,575 --> 00:52:18,826
Oh, shit.

656
00:52:46,937 --> 00:52:50,191
Get me broadband noise reduction.
I don't like hearing this!

657
00:52:50,358 --> 00:52:52,610
Speak quietly and act normally.

658
00:52:53,194 --> 00:52:56,030
How long did they say
the drugs would take?

659
00:52:57,948 --> 00:52:59,617
About five minutes.

660
00:53:11,045 --> 00:53:12,630
What is he doing?

661
00:53:12,797 --> 00:53:15,132
He's drinking. Give it a minute.

662
00:53:16,467 --> 00:53:18,052
Got a clean shot?

663
00:53:20,971 --> 00:53:22,139
Not yet.

664
00:53:30,398 --> 00:53:33,484
The man in that casino
would have killed two people.

665
00:53:35,152 --> 00:53:36,487
It happened.

666
00:53:36,987 --> 00:53:39,073
It just hadrt happened yet.

667
00:53:41,409 --> 00:53:43,661
Oh, my God, you are delusional.

668
00:53:51,502 --> 00:53:54,505
Fluffy cranberry or a stack of
chocolate chip pancakes for the kids.

669
00:53:54,588 --> 00:53:57,591
Fluffy cranberry or a stack
of chocolate chip pancakes

670
00:53:57,758 --> 00:53:58,843
for the kids in an instant.

671
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:00,428
Safe? Who knows what's safe?

672
00:54:00,511 --> 00:54:03,431
I knew a man who dropped
dead from looking at his wife.

673
00:54:03,597 --> 00:54:06,350
Safe? Who knows what's safe?

674
00:54:06,767 --> 00:54:08,769
I knew a man dropped dead
from looking at his wife.

675
00:54:08,853 --> 00:54:12,273
You can't get lost in the woods
if you never go into the woods.

676
00:54:12,857 --> 00:54:14,191
You can't get lost in the woods

677
00:54:14,275 --> 00:54:16,277
if you never go into the woods.

678
00:54:18,195 --> 00:54:21,615
That's right, sir. You're the
only person authorized to do so.

679
00:54:22,616 --> 00:54:26,203
That's right, sir. You are the
only person authorized to do so.

680
00:54:26,370 --> 00:54:27,955
How are you doing this?

681
00:54:28,122 --> 00:54:30,624
I have no idea how, but I can.

682
00:54:31,292 --> 00:54:33,377
I was born with it.

683
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:37,882
Is this some kind of a trick?

684
00:54:37,965 --> 00:54:40,551
You know we don't have time for that.

685
00:54:40,634 --> 00:54:42,970
You said anything was possible.

686
00:54:47,808 --> 00:54:50,227
So, you see things before they happen?

687
00:54:52,313 --> 00:54:53,397
You see the future?

688
00:54:53,481 --> 00:54:57,068
My future. What'll affect me,
and only two minutes ahead.

689
00:54:58,152 --> 00:54:59,487
Except you.

690
00:55:00,071 --> 00:55:02,156
For some reason, I saw you.

691
00:55:03,908 --> 00:55:05,326
For some reason, I saw you

692
00:55:05,409 --> 00:55:08,746
far beyond anything I'd ever
seen before and I don't know why.

693
00:55:12,166 --> 00:55:14,335
What do you mean, you saw me?

694
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:17,004
You've been...

695
00:55:17,088 --> 00:55:19,256
You've been doing that to me?

696
00:55:20,257 --> 00:55:22,593
You know what I'm going to
do and what I'm going to say?

697
00:55:22,677 --> 00:55:24,178
That you've just been setting me up?

698
00:55:24,261 --> 00:55:25,763
No, I haven't.

699
00:55:26,514 --> 00:55:30,434
I wanted to find you because I
needed to know why I was seeing you.

700
00:55:30,518 --> 00:55:31,936
And because I...

701
00:55:37,608 --> 00:55:39,276
It wasrt a setup.

702
00:55:56,544 --> 00:55:58,629
What do they want from you?

703
00:56:06,971 --> 00:56:10,057
They think I can help them in
matters of national security.

704
00:56:11,726 --> 00:56:13,227
...call code is received.

705
00:56:13,978 --> 00:56:17,148
The normal SSB radios in the aircraft...

706
00:56:17,732 --> 00:56:21,318
I don't understand. If you
can help, then why don't you?

707
00:56:22,236 --> 00:56:23,821
Because I can't.

708
00:56:25,489 --> 00:56:27,992
I can only give them a
two-minute head start.

709
00:56:28,075 --> 00:56:30,995
And that's if my life
is personally involved.

710
00:56:32,913 --> 00:56:34,999
But with me, you can see further.

711
00:56:35,082 --> 00:56:36,250
Yeah.

712
00:56:36,584 --> 00:56:38,586
But they don't know that.

713
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:52,600
There's almost $10,000 in this envelope.

714
00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:56,103
They know about you. You
need to get away from here.

715
00:56:57,104 --> 00:56:58,939
What time do you have?

716
00:57:00,441 --> 00:57:01,359
9:10.

717
00:57:01,525 --> 00:57:03,361
Set your watch to 9:17.

718
00:57:08,783 --> 00:57:10,034
Read this when I leave

719
00:57:10,117 --> 00:57:13,621
and wait exactly 45 seconds
before you do what it says.

720
00:57:13,788 --> 00:57:15,790
I'll take Ferris with me.

721
00:57:16,457 --> 00:57:18,542
It might be a week or a month,

722
00:57:18,626 --> 00:57:21,128
but if you can wait, I'll find you.

723
00:57:38,396 --> 00:57:42,733
...and yes, gentlemen, they are on
their way and no one can bring them back.

724
00:57:42,817 --> 00:57:44,485
Something's wrong.

725
00:58:14,849 --> 00:58:16,267
Don't do it.

726
00:58:16,934 --> 00:58:18,436
I already have.

727
00:58:24,108 --> 00:58:26,110
Go get him! Alive!

728
00:58:26,277 --> 00:58:27,194
Let's go!

729
00:59:00,978 --> 00:59:02,480
Bitch! Come on!

730
00:59:13,824 --> 00:59:15,326
Are you crazy?

731
00:59:28,589 --> 00:59:29,757
Oh, shit!

732
00:59:50,611 --> 00:59:52,863
Watch out! Get down!

733
01:00:25,396 --> 01:00:26,564
Johnson.

734
01:00:30,317 --> 01:00:32,486
You know you're not going to shoot.

735
01:00:42,747 --> 01:00:44,665
You going to let me die?

736
01:01:14,445 --> 01:01:17,615
Hey, I need some help!
Let's get him out of here!

737
01:01:21,452 --> 01:01:24,038
- Let's get him out of here.
- I got him.

738
01:01:28,459 --> 01:01:30,378
You all right? You okay?

739
01:01:30,795 --> 01:01:32,880
Open your eyes. Look at me.

740
01:01:33,631 --> 01:01:36,217
No good deed goes unpunished, does it?

741
01:01:41,472 --> 01:01:42,807
She got him.

742
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:44,392
Now what?

743
01:01:47,728 --> 01:01:48,896
You see her?

744
01:02:18,676 --> 01:02:19,844
Smoke?

745
01:02:31,605 --> 01:02:32,940
Thanks for today.

746
01:02:33,941 --> 01:02:36,527
Could've let me die. I appreciate it.

747
01:02:37,528 --> 01:02:39,697
That was a real show of character.

748
01:02:43,784 --> 01:02:46,370
I know I seem like the
bad guy in all this,

749
01:02:46,454 --> 01:02:48,956
but in the interests of
preserving our freedom

750
01:02:49,123 --> 01:02:51,375
there are larger issues at play.

751
01:02:56,047 --> 01:02:57,882
What about my freedom?

752
01:02:58,382 --> 01:03:00,885
With freedom comes responsibility.

753
01:03:01,469 --> 01:03:04,388
I have rights.

754
01:03:05,056 --> 01:03:06,474
This isn't about you.

755
01:03:06,557 --> 01:03:09,310
This is about eight
million other people.

756
01:03:11,062 --> 01:03:14,732
If I do what you want, you'll
keep me in this chair forever.

757
01:03:16,901 --> 01:03:20,071
There is a nuclear bomb
somewhere in Los Angeles.

758
01:03:20,821 --> 01:03:23,074
And every television
station in the world

759
01:03:23,157 --> 01:03:26,077
will broadcast the precise
details of its detonation.

760
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:30,081
So, go on, push that two
minutes as far as you can

761
01:03:30,915 --> 01:03:32,249
and find it.

762
01:03:33,334 --> 01:03:35,503
The system, which is still
just a tropical storm,

763
01:03:35,586 --> 01:03:37,838
is picking up steam
and heading for the U.S.

764
01:03:37,922 --> 01:03:39,507
Experts fear this storm

765
01:03:39,590 --> 01:03:43,260
has a good chance of growing to an
F3 status before making landfall.

766
01:03:43,761 --> 01:03:45,930
More worrisome, though,
is the strong possibility

767
01:03:46,097 --> 01:03:48,933
that it could travel through
what is known as Hurricane Alley

768
01:03:49,016 --> 01:03:50,518
into the Gulf of Mexico.

769
01:03:50,601 --> 01:03:54,188
The warm Gulf waters would cause
the storm to intensify quickly.

770
01:03:54,271 --> 01:03:56,857
Evacuation plans are already in place...

771
01:04:18,129 --> 01:04:19,630
...broadcast this afternoon for

772
01:04:19,714 --> 01:04:22,133
breaking news out of
downtown Los Angeles.

773
01:04:22,550 --> 01:04:25,386
...largest technology
corporations oppose this idea,

774
01:04:25,636 --> 01:04:28,806
and tech lobbying is blamed
for stalling the proposal...

775
01:04:28,973 --> 01:04:30,975
...members of the LAPD bomb squad

776
01:04:31,058 --> 01:04:32,810
are staging in that area.

777
01:04:32,893 --> 01:04:36,731
We go live now to reporter Lisa Joyner
at the scene for the very latest. Lisa.

778
01:04:36,814 --> 01:04:40,234
Jeff, the standoff began when police
received an anonymous phone call

779
01:04:40,317 --> 01:04:43,821
stating that explosives would be
detonated at this parking garage

780
01:04:44,155 --> 01:04:46,657
at 2nd and Broadway at 6:00 tonight.

781
01:04:46,907 --> 01:04:49,744
There's no... They have
no idea on a motive.

782
01:04:49,827 --> 01:04:51,162
The victim, however...

783
01:04:51,245 --> 01:04:52,830
Liz, I'm sorry.

784
01:04:53,164 --> 01:04:54,165
What?

785
01:04:54,832 --> 01:04:56,167
What did you say?

786
01:04:56,250 --> 01:04:58,836
The LAPD has surrounded the
area. They've secured a perimeter.

787
01:04:58,919 --> 01:05:01,339
But now the bomb squad
is making their way

788
01:05:01,505 --> 01:05:04,008
onto the deck of this building.

789
01:05:04,175 --> 01:05:07,845
And they're the men that are walking
up with black suits on and such.

790
01:05:13,351 --> 01:05:14,518
Oh, my God.

791
01:05:16,854 --> 01:05:19,357
There's been... There's
been an explosion.

792
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,275
There's been an explosion...

793
01:05:22,193 --> 01:05:23,778
Oh, my God.

794
01:05:24,695 --> 01:05:26,864
The victim has been identified

795
01:05:27,031 --> 01:05:29,033
as Elizabeth Cooper of Las Vegas.

796
01:05:29,533 --> 01:05:33,037
She was strapped to a wheelchair.

797
01:05:43,714 --> 01:05:44,882
Sorry.

798
01:05:49,970 --> 01:05:53,724
Approximately 10% of U.S.
Workers receive stock options.

799
01:05:53,808 --> 01:05:56,227
Many technology companies
give the options away...

800
01:05:56,310 --> 01:05:59,230
- Tell me what just happened.
- Yeah, I can't.

801
01:05:59,563 --> 01:06:01,565
It won't work like this.

802
01:06:01,649 --> 01:06:03,984
Get me out of this room
and I'll do what you want.

803
01:06:04,068 --> 01:06:06,487
I beg you, please get
me out of this room.

804
01:06:16,247 --> 01:06:17,665
Let him out!

805
01:06:29,093 --> 01:06:31,262
- Callie! Callie, wait up.
- What?

806
01:06:32,513 --> 01:06:34,098
Forensics report on Betty Peterson.

807
01:06:34,181 --> 01:06:37,018
The dead girl in the apartment?
Her throat was cut, bled out.

808
01:06:37,101 --> 01:06:40,104
Otherwise, nothing to DNA.
The place was immaculate again.

809
01:06:40,271 --> 01:06:41,272
How'd it go with Johnson?

810
01:06:41,439 --> 01:06:43,107
Well, something happened,
but he's not sharing.

811
01:06:43,190 --> 01:06:45,026
You know, there are
traces of potassium iodide.

812
01:06:45,109 --> 01:06:46,610
Some medication Peterson was taking?

813
01:06:46,777 --> 01:06:48,446
- They found an empty pillbox.
- No.

814
01:06:48,529 --> 01:06:52,366
The only reason to take it is
to prevent radiation poisoning.

815
01:07:01,042 --> 01:07:04,712
Hey, wait, can I get a smoke
or something? I need to relax.

816
01:07:09,383 --> 01:07:10,551
Thanks.

817
01:07:11,552 --> 01:07:13,471
Hey, can I get a light?

818
01:07:15,806 --> 01:07:17,308
Look at this. Look.

819
01:07:17,725 --> 01:07:18,976
Ta-da!

820
01:08:22,873 --> 01:08:24,542
Get it up here! Let's go!

821
01:08:25,376 --> 01:08:28,629
Base, Air 1. Base,
Air 1. I've got visual.

822
01:08:28,713 --> 01:08:31,799
Subject is spotted heading
south on 5th Street.

823
01:08:38,389 --> 01:08:41,559
Be advised, subject is
turning east onto Broadway.

824
01:09:03,748 --> 01:09:06,167
Stay here. Let me deal with this.

825
01:09:54,632 --> 01:09:56,217
Why are you here?

826
01:09:58,052 --> 01:09:59,637
They killed her.

827
01:10:01,222 --> 01:10:02,973
Two hours from now.

828
01:10:05,226 --> 01:10:06,811
They killed Liz.

829
01:10:07,311 --> 01:10:09,146
Tell me what you saw.

830
01:10:10,481 --> 01:10:12,400
I saw them execute her.

831
01:10:14,985 --> 01:10:16,404
Right there.

832
01:10:17,488 --> 01:10:18,823
On the roof.

833
01:10:24,495 --> 01:10:27,498
It hasn't happened yet
and I know who has her.

834
01:10:28,416 --> 01:10:29,834
It's the same people we're after.

835
01:10:29,917 --> 01:10:32,837
There's a reason that they brought
you here. They're using Liz as bait.

836
01:10:33,004 --> 01:10:34,422
10-1 you go out on that roof,

837
01:10:34,505 --> 01:10:36,007
they're going to put
a bullet in your brain.

838
01:10:36,090 --> 01:10:37,258
I know.

839
01:10:37,842 --> 01:10:40,261
Right now, she's still alive.

840
01:10:40,428 --> 01:10:42,263
She is, you are, we all are.

841
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:44,265
Let's try to keep it that way.

842
01:10:44,348 --> 01:10:46,851
I help you, you help me, all right?

843
01:10:49,687 --> 01:10:51,605
I want a two-mile radius.

844
01:10:51,856 --> 01:10:55,192
Every telephone grid,
shortwave, cell tower.

845
01:10:55,276 --> 01:10:56,694
Shut it down.

846
01:10:57,278 --> 01:10:58,946
What do you want me to do?

847
01:11:00,281 --> 01:11:01,949
Let him shoot you.

848
01:11:42,490 --> 01:11:44,325
Your call cannot be completed as dialed.

849
01:11:44,408 --> 01:11:46,410
Check the number and dial again.

850
01:11:50,414 --> 01:11:52,750
Your call cannot be completed as dialed.

851
01:11:52,917 --> 01:11:54,669
FBI! Down on your knees!

852
01:12:04,178 --> 01:12:06,681
You okay? That looked pretty close.

853
01:12:07,181 --> 01:12:08,766
Sleight of hand.

854
01:12:10,851 --> 01:12:13,521
- You didn't get him.
- Not alive. He fired on the chopper.

855
01:12:13,688 --> 01:12:15,690
But it doesn't matter. He
couldn't call in the hit.

856
01:12:15,815 --> 01:12:17,608
So as far as they're
concerned, you're not here yet.

857
01:12:17,692 --> 01:12:19,276
It buys us time.

858
01:12:23,114 --> 01:12:26,033
Every way I try this,
she still ends up dead.

859
01:12:27,827 --> 01:12:28,953
What if you do it earlier?

860
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:30,204
They have to bring her
here in a vehicle, right?

861
01:12:30,287 --> 01:12:32,790
- Looking for a license plate.
- Right.

862
01:12:41,799 --> 01:12:43,300
Can you see it?

863
01:12:44,802 --> 01:12:47,388
It helps if you don't speak right now.

864
01:13:42,860 --> 01:13:44,612
California plate number

865
01:13:45,488 --> 01:13:48,866
50KF272 50KF272.

866
01:13:49,283 --> 01:13:53,329
California tag. 5, 0,
kilo, foxtrot, 2, 7, 2.

867
01:14:11,889 --> 01:14:13,891
Please, where are you taking me?

868
01:14:15,893 --> 01:14:17,895
What do you want with me?

869
01:14:24,318 --> 01:14:26,404
Who the hell are you people?

870
01:14:29,490 --> 01:14:31,158
SITREP, Cavanaugh.

871
01:14:31,325 --> 01:14:32,451
Local SWAT has been deployed and the

872
01:14:32,576 --> 01:14:34,036
regional team just showed to back us up.

873
01:14:34,161 --> 01:14:35,246
All right, listen up.

874
01:14:35,329 --> 01:14:37,832
A van carrying Elizabeth
Cooper will exit the warehouse

875
01:14:37,915 --> 01:14:40,751
across from Pier 18 compound
in approximately five minutes.

876
01:14:40,835 --> 01:14:42,753
Four minutes and 27 seconds.

877
01:14:42,878 --> 01:14:44,755
- Do you mind?
- Not anymore. Go ahead.

878
01:14:44,922 --> 01:14:48,342
They've got her wrapped in
explosives, wired to a cell phone.

879
01:14:48,426 --> 01:14:50,761
Remote trigger. Another
cell phone sets it off.

880
01:14:50,928 --> 01:14:52,221
Usually a one-button speed dial.

881
01:14:52,263 --> 01:14:55,266
They'll take this route
to the entrance gate.

882
01:14:55,391 --> 01:14:57,935
At that point, Alpha and Bravo
will swarm the entrance...

883
01:14:58,019 --> 01:15:01,272
If you could just be quiet
and do exactly what I say,

884
01:15:01,439 --> 01:15:03,190
I'll save your life.

885
01:15:04,442 --> 01:15:05,860
We need to stop the vehicle here

886
01:15:06,027 --> 01:15:07,194
before they get through the gates.

887
01:15:07,319 --> 01:15:09,780
Alpha and Bravo will
hold and contain here.

888
01:15:09,864 --> 01:15:12,116
Sniper teams will
initiate on Johnsors call.

889
01:15:12,283 --> 01:15:14,160
On his call. Are we clear?

890
01:15:14,869 --> 01:15:17,038
All elements shoot to kill any hostiles.

891
01:15:17,121 --> 01:15:18,372
What about intel?

892
01:15:18,456 --> 01:15:20,458
We don't need them. We have him.

893
01:15:21,292 --> 01:15:23,544
All right, everybody! Let's go!

894
01:15:23,794 --> 01:15:25,463
Move out! Let's go!

895
01:16:08,172 --> 01:16:10,257
Go! Let's go! Move!

896
01:16:12,009 --> 01:16:14,011
Back up! Back up! Back up!

897
01:16:29,193 --> 01:16:30,361
Go, go, go!

898
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:34,115
- Stop the van.
- Not yet. You'll kill her.

899
01:16:39,161 --> 01:16:39,537
Now.

900
01:16:39,537 --> 01:16:40,204
Now.

901
01:16:52,383 --> 01:16:54,301
You're good to go! Now, now!

902
01:16:57,471 --> 01:17:00,391
This is Charlie 1 on approach,
east side of building.

903
01:17:21,746 --> 01:17:23,247
Move back! Move back!

904
01:17:23,914 --> 01:17:26,542
This is Alpha Unit,
Alpha-U! We're taking fire!

905
01:17:27,084 --> 01:17:29,712
Take out the guy on the
crane, northeast corner.

906
01:17:30,087 --> 01:17:32,590
- Negative on a visual.
- Give me that.

907
01:17:33,424 --> 01:17:36,927
Aim for the doorway, eight
inches above the guardrail.

908
01:17:41,015 --> 01:17:42,600
On me, let's go!

909
01:18:21,138 --> 01:18:23,641
Zed David, Charlie 1 at entry point.

910
01:18:39,323 --> 01:18:40,741
Turn right.

911
01:18:41,325 --> 01:18:42,743
You're clear.

912
01:18:56,215 --> 01:18:57,800
You're good! Go! Go!

913
01:18:58,509 --> 01:18:59,927
Come on! Let's go!

914
01:19:07,018 --> 01:19:08,102
Number 2 loading dock.

915
01:19:08,185 --> 01:19:09,812
Repeat. Number 2 loading dock.

916
01:19:10,312 --> 01:19:11,439
Stop.

917
01:19:14,275 --> 01:19:15,276
No!

918
01:19:17,028 --> 01:19:18,112
Go.

919
01:20:08,204 --> 01:20:11,582
This is Charlie 1 element,
moving and clearing, over.

920
01:21:19,233 --> 01:21:20,401
Thanks.

921
01:21:46,344 --> 01:21:51,098
There are explosives
there, there and there.

922
01:21:51,599 --> 01:21:52,975
Stay close.

923
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:23,798
- Sniper.
- Where?

924
01:22:23,881 --> 01:22:25,466
- Behind us.
- Sniper, six o'clock.

925
01:22:25,549 --> 01:22:27,635
- Got a visual?
- Nobody move!

926
01:22:27,718 --> 01:22:29,220
I'll find him.

927
01:22:35,059 --> 01:22:36,894
Catwalk, second level.

928
01:22:37,561 --> 01:22:39,647
Catwalk, six o'clock. Second level.

929
01:22:40,815 --> 01:22:42,024
Got him.

930
01:23:02,753 --> 01:23:04,338
We'll have to clear this deck by deck.

931
01:23:04,422 --> 01:23:06,966
You take this one. I'll do the rest.

932
01:23:07,258 --> 01:23:09,093
Let's sweep and clear.

933
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:52,905
She's near the engine room.

934
01:25:02,456 --> 01:25:03,874
Come on, man.

935
01:25:04,375 --> 01:25:07,128
Release the hostage. You
can still get out of this.

936
01:25:07,294 --> 01:25:08,713
Don't patronize me.

937
01:25:12,633 --> 01:25:14,468
How good are you with that gun?

938
01:25:14,552 --> 01:25:15,636
Very.

939
01:25:17,805 --> 01:25:19,306
You're going to be okay, Liz.

940
01:25:19,432 --> 01:25:20,516
Back off!

941
01:25:23,394 --> 01:25:25,896
I've seen every possible ending here.

942
01:25:26,772 --> 01:25:28,357
None of them are good for you.

943
01:25:28,482 --> 01:25:30,317
I'll take my chances.

944
01:25:32,403 --> 01:25:34,071
One more step, fortune teller,

945
01:25:34,238 --> 01:25:36,574
and it definitely won't be good for you.

946
01:25:46,417 --> 01:25:48,336
You have one way out of this.

947
01:25:50,671 --> 01:25:52,256
That wasrt it.

948
01:25:55,009 --> 01:25:56,344
Liz, look at me.

949
01:25:56,927 --> 01:25:57,970
It's okay.

950
01:25:58,054 --> 01:25:59,930
Look at me. It's over.

951
01:26:02,433 --> 01:26:03,851
It's over.

952
01:26:04,185 --> 01:26:05,353
No, it's not.

953
01:26:11,442 --> 01:26:15,237
The nuclear device was moved. We
need to find its exact location.

954
01:26:15,446 --> 01:26:18,616
Now, this registers any significant
detonation in the earth's crust.

955
01:26:18,783 --> 01:26:20,868
Take a look. Tell me what you see.

956
01:26:27,708 --> 01:26:29,335
Something's wrong.

957
01:26:33,130 --> 01:26:34,799
I made a mistake.

958
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:37,385
What?

959
01:26:37,802 --> 01:26:39,387
I made a mistake.

960
01:26:40,388 --> 01:26:41,639
- It's happening.
- When?

961
01:26:41,764 --> 01:26:42,807
Now!

962
01:27:24,557 --> 01:27:25,933
All right, I got four teams in place.

963
01:27:26,017 --> 01:27:27,184
We're just waiting on the road crew.

964
01:27:27,351 --> 01:27:28,602
All right.

965
01:27:28,686 --> 01:27:30,312
- Ferris.
- It's me.

966
01:27:33,357 --> 01:27:35,443
I'll do it, but I have conditions.

967
01:27:38,946 --> 01:27:40,740
I want her left out of it.

968
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:45,036
I'm sure we can work something out.

969
01:28:11,729 --> 01:28:12,730
Liz?

970
01:28:17,151 --> 01:28:18,152
Liz?

971
01:28:21,322 --> 01:28:22,490
Hey.

972
01:28:26,077 --> 01:28:27,662
Come back to bed.

973
01:28:28,204 --> 01:28:29,580
I got to go.

974
01:28:32,333 --> 01:28:33,417
Go where?

975
01:28:37,546 --> 01:28:41,509
There's something I have to do.
I can't put it off any longer.

976
01:28:56,023 --> 01:28:57,525
Are you coming back?

977
01:28:57,608 --> 01:28:58,693
Yeah.

978
01:29:02,947 --> 01:29:04,865
It may be a week

979
01:29:05,366 --> 01:29:06,742
or a month.

980
01:29:08,786 --> 01:29:11,122
But if you can wait, I'll find you.

981
01:29:48,659 --> 01:29:51,037
Here's the thing about the future.

982
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:52,747
Every time you look at it,

983
01:29:52,830 --> 01:29:56,083
it changes because you looked at it.

984
01:29:56,167 --> 01:29:58,753
And that changes everything else.

985
01:30:12,975 --> 01:30:14,268
You ready?

986
01:30:15,269 --> 01:30:16,354
Yeah.
