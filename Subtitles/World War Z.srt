<i>This is J.T.L. Morning News.</i>

3
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,448
<i>This is Holly Chadwick.</i>

4
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,646
Thanks for joining us.

5
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,405
<i>We have a great show
in store for you this morning.</i>

6
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,131
<i>Well, it's
a great morning to be in the studio.</i>

7
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,407
<i>Authorities have
confirmed an avian flu outbreak.</i>

8
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,845
<i>Forecast, cloudy skies...</i>

9
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,922
<i>Good morning.
Reporting from Brighton.</i>

10
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,049
<i>This
will be a different scenario</i>

11
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,488
<i>if the virus changes in a way that allows
transmission between humans.</i>

12
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,085
- So, let's get started.

13
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,926
<i>Yet again today,</i>

14
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,049
<i>another group of dolphins
became stranded.</i>

15
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,050
CO2 emissions have
dramatically increased in...

16
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,129
<i>Are there any
real threats that you know of?</i>

17
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,446
Not at all.

18
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,210
<i>Environmentalists are trying</i>

19
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,691
<i>to determine the cause of death.</i>

20
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,484
<i>At alert level six,</i>

21
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,642
<i>W.H.O. guidelines for governments...</i>

22
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,041
Your socks are so cute! I like them.

23
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,921
Police say they've seen
similar cases recently

24
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,690
<i>of people behaving strangely.</i>

25
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,161
<i>The U.N.
health agency is not likely</i>

26
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,641
<i>to recommend official travel restrictions.</i>

27
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,444
<i>It's a little bit unsettling.</i>

28
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,000
<i>They're not physicists.
They're not engineers.</i>

29
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,366
They think it's just gonna go away.

30
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,080
They live in a fantasy parallel universe.

31
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,601
<i>Right on top
of the man, beating him.</i>

32
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,841
<i>The man is bleeding.</i>

33
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,251
<i>Twenty-one
confirmed cases.</i>

34
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,642
All the talk
about a doomsday is a big hoax.

35
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,131
<i>The subject growled at him</i>

36
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,248
<i>and continued to maul the victim.</i>

37
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,642
<i>The best estimate
is about 15,000 in the U.K.</i>

38
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,000
<i>We don't
know if this is spreading.</i>

39
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,451
<i>Rhythms of change...</i>

40
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,522
<i>So far
there's no manifestation.</i>

41
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,524
<i>Monitors have arrived,
even carrying them...</i>

42
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,886
<i>With that much
public at risk, we cannot...</i>

43
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,081
<i>They're trying to move us on,
trying to tell the journalists to get out.</i>

44
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,281
Wake up!

45
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,407
- Oh, creatures in our bed...

46
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,767
- No sleeping!

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,570
Oh, you're getting very big.

48
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,564
- What do you want to eat?
- Pancakes!

49
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,011
<i>We got a lot more sunshine today.</i>

50
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,481
You have to only say one word.

51
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,320
Hey, by the way,
what do you want for your birthday?

52
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,407
Say a puppy.

53
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,567
A puppy.

54
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,404
You mean
a stuffed animal puppy?

55
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,005
Because that we can do.

56
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,931
<i>Scusi.</i>

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,162
Good morning.
That looks yummy.

58
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,724
She gets the bigger one?

59
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,410
- Yeah, sorry.
- She's tiny.

60
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,363
Did you pack your, um, inhaler?

61
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,686
Bathroom sink.

62
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,081
- In a minute?
- Scootch! Go.

63
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,768
<i>The government
has declared martial law.</i>

64
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,604
Daddy, what's martial law?

65
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,649
Uh...

66
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,202
Martial law is like house rules,
but for everybody.

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,561
Were you ever
in places like that with your old job?

68
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,881
Mmm-hmm.

69
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,641
But I quit my old job
so I could be with you.

70
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,967
Do you miss it?

71
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,406
No, I like my new job.

72
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,205
All you do is make pancakes
in the morning!

73
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,600
Yeah, but I'm really good at it.

74
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,405
Look who I found!
- Oh!

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,331
<i>Here comes the number 12 train!</i>

76
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,765
It's not Subway Sam, is it?

77
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,561
You want more pancakes?

78
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,525
Good.

79
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,967
Go, go, go. Come on, scootch!

80
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,804
- At least...
- Move it on out.

81
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,769
Hey! Plates in the sink!

82
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,681
- Later!
- Do that when we get back!

83
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,165
Uh... Does it live in the jungle?

84
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,241
Oooh.

85
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,441
No.

86
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,806
Do you eat it on Sundays?

87
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,967
No.

88
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,924
Does it live
on the Great Plains of Africa?

89
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,528
- Yeah.
- Oh, well, I guess, yeah.

90
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,922
Do people keep it in pens all its
life and harvest it for meat?

91
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,604
- That's really gross!
- Gross!

92
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,727
Dad!

93
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,962
Is it an animal you'd have for a pet?

94
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,605
- Yes.
- Is it a cat?

95
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,041
- Yes.
Ha ha ha.

96
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,200
- Okay, now we have another one.
- Do another one.

97
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,083
- You totally got one!

98
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,361
Why are there so many?

99
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,120
It's like, three in the last five minutes.

100
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,040
- What is going on?

101
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,285
<i>The World
Health Organization has been</i>

102
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,169
<i>tracking the recent outbreak of rabies</i>

103
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,006
<i>that began in Taiwan and has now been
reported in over 12 countries.</i>

<i>Responding to allegations he hasn't
done enough to prevent the spread...</i>

105
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,611
Can we try BBC?

106
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,323
You're not British anymore, baby.

107
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,970
You lost your accent a long time ago.

108
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,408
Except after two bottles of wine.

109
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,726
Am I British?

110
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,006
Yeah, your grandma is.

111
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,961
- Hey!
- Yo!

112
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,450
He's just gonna keep going, Daddy?

113
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,521
Hold on, guys.

114
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,687
Daddy, be careful on the road.

115
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,450
It's okay, baby.

<i>Can be

120
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,286
Yeah, I'm okay. Thanks.

121
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,601
- You need anything?
- No. You know what's going on?

122
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,170
No, man, I don't know anything.

123
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,645
It's crazy.

124
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,961
Gerry?

125
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,161
Get back in your car right now!

126
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,170
Remain with your ve...

127
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,161
What are we doing?

128
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,601
That's our way out of here.

129
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,724
I want my blanket!

130
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,921
Baby, it's packed right now.

131
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,325
Snuggle with Subway Sam, okay?

132
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,445
My blanket!

133
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,921
Rach?

134
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,082
Rachel, baby, you've got
to get back in your seat.

135
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,609
- Baby, we need you in your seat.
- Put your belt on!

136
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,920
Rachel, right now!

137
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,809
- Gerry?
- Rach, get your belt back on!

138
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,091
- You okay?
- You okay?

139
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,009
- Rachel, sweetheart?
- Rachel, you hurt?

140
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,008
- Connie?
- Are you okay? It's okay.

141
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,561
We should get out.

142
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,971
Everybody out of the car.

143
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,322
We've got to get out of the city.

144
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,568
Her door won't open!
Rachel, go out that side.

145
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,206
Okay, you have to climb over, honey.

146
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,725
Out of the way!

147
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,800
Move it!

148
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,125
Come on, honey. Come on.

149
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,283
Sweetheart, are you okay?

150
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,762
Let's go. Let's get off the street.

151
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,245
What is that, Gerry? What is that?

152
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,526
I don't know!

153
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,445
Get to the RV.

00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,567
Subway Sam!

<i>Train's in the station!</i>

168
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,120
Gerry!

169
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,210
- Watch out!

170
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,451
<i>We're pulling
back on Fifth Street!</i>

171
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,170
<i>Containment is a fail.</i>

172
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,929
- Try to relax.

173
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,805
Give yourself air.

174
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,651
In and out.

175
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,806
- Come on, baby, try to relax.

176
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,886
Gerry? We left my purse in the car.

177
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,166
Where's her spare?

178
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,810
I'm gonna go check
your backpack, all right?

179
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,208
Do you want to be with her?

180
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,640
Rach, you'll be all right.
You're gonna be all right.

181
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,081
Hey, hey, you breathe
through your nose.

182
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,847
Rach, Rach, look at me. Look at me.

183
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,170
You're gonna be all right.

184
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,081
You've done this a hundred times.
Look at me. Look at me.

185
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,125
Breathe in through your nose,
out through your mouth.

186
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,281
Okay, we're gonna go to a pharmacy.

187
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,010
We gotta move.

188
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,126
Okay.

189
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,801
Good. Good. Look.

190
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,480
Look at me, look at me.
Rach, breathe through your nose.

191
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,925
No, no, no, no...

192
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,570
You're gonna be all right.

193
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,400
- Look at me.
- Daddy, what are those things?

194
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,562
Honey, find us some water.
Okay? Something to drink.

195
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,167
It's Thierry.

196
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,401
Where are you?

197
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,367
<i>Airborne.
Lower East Side to Turtle Bay.</i>

198
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,162
It's all gone. We barely made it out.

199
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,680
- Tell him to go south.
- No, no, we need visual confirmation.

200
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,760
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

201
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,441
What is this?

202
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,050
We don't know. How close were you?

203
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,567
Face to face.

204
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,045
Good, honey, good.

205
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,121
Daddy.

206
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,489
Connie, give me that.

207
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,050
Give me that. Oh, thank you, honey.

208
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,441

209
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,806
95, heading north.

210
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,889
- Okay. Okay.

211
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,203
<i>All right.
We'll try to get a helicopter to you.</i>

212
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,282
I'll call you back with
an extraction point.

213
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,488
<i>Can you hold out for another hour?</i>

214
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,085
Do we have a choice?

215
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,844
<i>This is not
for old time's sake, my friend.</i>

216

<i>I need you back.</i>

218
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,447
Don't forget about us.

219
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,010
What do you mean, we've lost Boston?

220
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,570
All right. Good luck, Gerry.

221
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,727
Okay.

222
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,804
Good, honey. Keep it going.
It's gonna be all right.

223
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,967
- Come here. Stay close.
- Super close.

224
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,610
Take my hand.

225
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,568
Get her medicine,
I'll get us something to eat.

226
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,563
I'll meet you back here.

227
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,044
Stay close, honey.

228
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,370
What do you need?

229
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,007
Albuterol.

230
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,521
They outgrow the asthma supposedly.

231
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,282
And this shit, too. It's magic for my kid.

232
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,524
Thank you.

233

Get off of me! That's all I have.

00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,924
Okay, come on.

329
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,845
I'm scared.

330
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,209
Connie, there's a helicopter
waiting for us on the roof.

331
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,926
Keep your eyes
on Mommy and Daddy, okay?

332
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,360
Be ninja quiet.

333
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,843
Just a walk in the park.

334
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,523
How do we know they're coming?

335
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,450
They're coming.

336
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,521
Ready?

337
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,722
- Okay, come on, guys.

338
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,645
Come on! Come on!

339
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,721
Up, up, up.

340
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,326
Come on, baby.

341
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,965
Go, go, go!

342
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,282
- Come on, baby!
- Go, go!

343
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,562
Go, girls! Gerry!

344
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,120
Come on. Gerry!

345
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,611
Girls, get back!

346
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,804
Watch out!

347
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,329
- Go!
- Go, go, go!

348
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,170
Come on, faster, girls!

349
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,282
<i>Lieutenant, I've got no contact.</i>

350
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,124
<i>I say again, no contact.</i>

351
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,800
Let's go, let's go!

352
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,601
Karin!

353
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,045
- Karin!
- Yeah.

354
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,606
Go through the door!

355
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,601
Gerry?

356
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,043
<i>There they are!
Ace, we have positive contact.</i>

357
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,810
That's our target! Get us down!

358
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,961
Daddy!

359
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,929
- Daddy!
- Baby, get back.

360
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,491
Daddy!

361
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,561
Gerry?

362
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,244
- Gerry, what?
- Stay back!

363
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,731
Baby! No!

364
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,165
One thousand seven.

365
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,730
One thousand eight.

366
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,490
Daddy, get off the edge!

367
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,006
- Gerry, please?
- One thousand ten.

368
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,684
One thousand eleven.

369
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,124
I got it in my mouth.

370
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,641
You're okay. You're okay.

371
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,170
- Go! Go!

372
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,731
Come on. Come on.

373
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,361
Let's go! Let's go!

374
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,483
Come on, let's go! We got to go!

375
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,081
You got her?

376
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,689
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

377
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,324
<i>Traffic en route,
altitude 5-7 thousand.</i>

378
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,007
<i>Heading 250. Turn right,
heading 075, once clear.</i>

379
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,684
<i>Remain below 4,000.</i>

380
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:00,484
<i>Clear to land,
heading 040, wind 060 at five.</i>

381
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,123
<i>Follow L.S.O. directions.
Prep for immediate dust off.</i>

382
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,406
Gerry.

383
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,965
Thank you.

384
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,042
Good to see you, my friend.

385
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,921
<i>Tango five,
this is Argus command.</i>

386
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,121
<i>Cleared for take-off.</i>

387
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,323
<i>Tango five. Wilco.</i>

388
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,520
Karin, to the right.

389
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,330
This is good, right?

390
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,084
Bunk beds!

391
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,130
Your bunk beds
are number two, three and six.

392
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,680
Please make yourself at home.

393
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,171
You want to get up here?

394
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,764
- There you go, sweetheart.
- That's good.

395
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,649
<i>We're not dropping anchor again.</i>

396
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,246
You're safe.

397
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,446
It's not me I'm worried about.

398
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,965
They're safe.

399
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,005
Baby.

400
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,886
It's bigger than
our old apartment on 72nd.

401
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,326
Need anything, Karin?

402
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,887
Water.

403
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,607
I'll organize.

404
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,601
Is this worldwide?
Is anyone doing better than we are?

405
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,041
Baby. Go talk somewhere else.

406
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,806
Okay.

407
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,206
The President is dead.

408
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,205
Four of six Joint Chiefs. V.P. missing.

409
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,644
Reports of gun battles
in the streets of the capital.

410
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,881
Your parties are panicking.

411
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,365
The bigger cities are the worst off.

412
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,410
The airlines
were the perfect delivery system.

413
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,928
Carnival cruise vessel Dream
has been given permission to join.

414
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,726
<i>Twenty seven knots south and closing.</i>

415
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,088
How soon are they showing
symptoms after contact?

416
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,041
The provisional
government currently considers

417
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,525
northern Minnesota
to be a potential safe zone.

418
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,360
Have you recorded
any instance where a person

419
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,925
was bitten but not infected?

420
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,443
How the hell do I know
if Russia's fallen?

421
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,048
Sir, I cannot action that order.

422
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,849
Colonel, I'm sorry,
but we cannot facilitate

423
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,763
an evacuation for you or your men.

424
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:41,044
Sir, there is nowhere to evacuate you to.

425
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,882
Malnutrition. Dirty water.

426
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,443
No gas for the winter or transportation.

427
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,684
No bullets to fight.

428
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,561
And it has spread
to all corners of the globe.

429
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,965
The question
that we have got to address

430
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,360
is what the hell is it?

431
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,681
About 5% of the population
aren't affected immediately.

432
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,606
It is viral. it has to be viral.
There is no plausible alternative.

433
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,885
And like any virus, once we find its
origin, we can develop a vaccine.

434
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,611
- We find it, contain it...
- That's Dr. Fassbach.

435
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,526
Virologist from Harvard.

436
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,080
The analogy I keep coming back to

437
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,651
is Spanish Flu.

438
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,847
Spanish Flu?

439
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,008
It didn't exist in 1918, but by 1920,

440
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,048
it killed 3% Of the world.

441
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,528
He's our best bet
at figuring out what this thing is.

442
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,485
You all read the same email I did,

443
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,531
- and it said "zombies."

444
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,887
Are you completely out of your mind?

445
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,531
So, the earliest mention
of the word "zombie"

446
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,410
was in a memo
from Camp Humphreys in South Korea.

447
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,244
We haven't had contact with them since.

448
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,685
But this could lead us to the origin.

449
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,524
If we knew where this thing started,

450
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,683
then we'd have a chance
of developing a vaccine to stop it.

451
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,604
So we send in Dr. Fassbach
there to look for the source.

452
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,205
He's just a kid.

453
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,241
You're right.

454
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,685
Attention on deck!

455
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,326
At ease!

456
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,163
Mr. Under-Secretary.

457
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,685
The Under-Secretary
here says you were

458
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,445
his best investigator
when you were at the U.N.

459
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,921
I want to send you in. With a team.

460
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,004
Help Dr. Fassbach
find whatever it is he needs.

461
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,761
You brought...

462
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,842
I wanted for the circumstances
to speak for themselves.

463
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,046
No.

464
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,682
Captain, I'm not your guy.

465
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,849
You were on the ground
during the Liberian Civil War.

466
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,601
Investigated Chechen war crimes.
Sri Lanka in '07.

467
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,690
Places you and I both know
Dr. Fassbach wouldn't last a night in.

468
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,206
Gerry, a handful of SEALs
will go with you as security force.

469
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,327
No.

470
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,482
My guys will get you in,
you assist the doctor,

471
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,648
pursue any leads,
my guys will get you out.

472
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,570
We do the heavy lifting.

473
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,728
I can't help you. I can't leave my family.

474
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,888
Take a look around here, Mr. Lane.

475
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:56,644
Each and every one of these people are
here because they serve a purpose.

476
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,403
There's no room here
for non-essential personnel.

477
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,125
There's a long line of people

478
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,004
waiting for one of those bunks.

479
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,449
You want to help your family,

480
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,211
let's figure out how we stop this.

481
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,922
It's your choice, Mr. Lane.

482
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,401
Simple.

483
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,371
<i>You don't work for them anymore.</i>

484
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,885
- Karin...
- You might not remember

485
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,042
What this job did to you, but I do.

486
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,088
So do not ask me to say yes to this.

487
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,207
I have to go.

488
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,044
They're going to kick us off the ship.

489
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,927
What?

490
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,603
If I go, you, the girls, Tommy,
have a place to stay.

491
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,524
If I don't, we're back in Philly tonight.

492
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,046
What about Thierry?
Can't he do anything?

493
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,603
Men like Thierry
aren't in charge of anything anymore.

494
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,203
You keep this with you.

495
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,281
I'll call in once a day.

496
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,727
As long as I make that call,
everything's gonna be okay.

497
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,090
I'm coming back.

498
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,568
Okay?
We're going to make the best of it.

499
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,451
As we do.

500
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,131
Like we do.

501
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,804
Okay, baby doll,
Daddy's got to go to work.

502
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,010
I'm not a baby.

503
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,166
Okay.

504
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,642
Tall, beautiful, tiny adult.

505
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,082
I'll be back soon.

506
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,366
Yeah?

507
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,689
All right, tough guy...

508
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,361
Take care of the ladies for me?

509
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,487
Yeah.

510
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,761
Deal.

511
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,010
You're awesome.

512
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,008
Daddy's coming back.

513
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,045
This way, sir.

514
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,321
Look.

515
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,606
We don't know what we're walking into.

516
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,728
So we do what they say. Okay.

517
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,360
If they move, we move.
If they stop, we stop.

518
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,124
If things were to get crazy,

519
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,731
just focus on their boots,

520
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,325
focus on their voices,
and we'll be all right.

521
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,841
- Mmm-hmm.
- These guys are hammers.

522
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,684
And to hammers,
everything looks like nails.

523
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,841
I heard that.

524
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,445
You were meant to.

525
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,568
So, you see something that's important,

526
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,847
you call it out and we'll make it happen.

527
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,526
Okay.

528
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,402
You think we're gonna find anything?

529
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,161
Yeah.

530
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,404
Yeah, we're gonna find something.

531
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,764
Mother Nature is a serial killer.

532
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,410
No one's better.

533
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,250
More creative.

534
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,726
But like all serial killers,

535
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,610
she can't help the urge
to want to get caught.

536
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,844
What good are all those brilliant crimes

537
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,002
if no one takes the credit?

538
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,088
So she leaves crumbs.

539
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,200
Now, the hard part,
why you spend a decade in school,

540
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,204
is seeing the crumbs
for the clues they are.

541
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,922
Sometimes the thing you thought

542
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,488
was the most brutal aspect of the virus,

543
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,641
turns out to be the chink in its armor.

544
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,641
And she loves disguising
her weaknesses as strengths.

545
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,685
She's a bitch.

546
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,281
<i>Attention
D.C. has gone dark. I repeat,</i>

547
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,725
D.C. has gone dark.

548
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,808
The Capitol evacuation
has been suspended.

549
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,410
<i>All available resources should be
directed to Naval Station Norfolk.</i>

550
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,808
<i>All
non-essential personnel</i>

551
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,611
<i>given F-6 status
and in groups A through E</i>

552
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,524
<i>need to report
to the flight deck for relocation.</i>

553
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,969
<i>Groups A and B relocating to Orlando</i>

554
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,441
<i>should be on the stern
clear of the landing zone.</i>

555
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,650
<i>I say again, all non-essential
personnel given F-6 status</i>

556
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,762
<i>need to report to the flight deck.</i>

557
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,810
<i>Choppers are inbound
for immediate relocation.</i>

558
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,723
Mommy, is this dinner?

559
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,166
Yes, sweetheart.

560
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,208
Water here tastes funny.

561
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,370
It's jet fuel, young lady.

562
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,131
He's joking.

563
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,086
I wish. Desal has trouble filtering it out.

564
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,282
Probably because
there's too many people on this ship.

565
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,562
Everybody wake up.

566
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,726
<i>We're on approach
to Camp Humphreys.</i>

567
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,168
<i>Most of the base is dark,
and no one is manning the tower.</i>

568
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,280
<i>We're running on fumes,
so there's really no choice,</i>

569
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,731
<i>I've got to put us down.</i>

570
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,131
<i>So buckle up.</i>

571
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,801
Hold up.

572
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,562
Keep your finger off the trigger.

573
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,646
Okay.

574
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,411
Fassbach! Wait!!

575
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,286
Damn it.

576
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,200
Move back!

577
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,130
Friendly! Friendly!
Keep it down. Keep it down.

578
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,009
What is this? What happened to him?

579
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,566
He slipped. He's dead.

580
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,608
Come on! Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

581
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,681
Okay, I'm good!

582
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,048
- Who was it? Who fell?
- Skilken.

583
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,202
- Hold! Clear.
- Hold.

584
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,684
I want an ammo count,
then you reload your mags!

585
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,807
Yes, sir!

586
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,803
My boy who just died out there was 23.

587
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,931
He was 23.

588
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,249
You want to tell me why?

589
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:07,086
Because the guy who just shot
himself, he's a doctor, a virologist.

590
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,886
What are you talking about?

591
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,769
He was supposed
to be our best hope.

592
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,490
Well, he's not our best hope anymore.

593
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,688
Hey.
That guy volunteered to come here.

594
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,205
He didn't have to, you know.

595
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,520
None of them did.

596
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,120
We're still trying to figure out
what the hell this thing is.

597
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,681
Well, shit happens.

598
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,402
The doctor would have
strongly agreed with you.

599
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,970
How do we go about refueling?

600
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,203
When I say so. And very carefully.

601
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,481
The noise, are they drawn to it?

602
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,286
Yeah. Sound draws them.

603
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,041
Body shots only seem
to slow them down.

604
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,600
Head shots do the trick,
but just to be safe

605
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,762
we tend to burn them when we can.

606
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,048
- You fought any Zeke yet?
- Yeah.

607
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,607
- Where?
- Philly. Newark.

608
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,007
Bad?

609
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,361
- What about Houston?
- St. Louis?

610
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,487
- Baltimore?
- Atlanta?

611
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,721
Detroit?

612
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,080
Guys, I'll be honest with you,

613
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:02,124
I don't know of any place back
home that's doing very well.

614
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,611
All right...

615
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,204
If the other guy was a virologist,
what do you do?

616
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:11,762
There was a memo
sent from this installation 11 days ago.

617
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,320
It had the word "zombie" in it.

618
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,368
Do you know anything about it?

619
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,521
Yeah.

620
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,321
It was an email, not a memo.

621
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,286
Pretty obvious
nobody back home bothered to read it.

622
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,449
Now, there's 15, 16 guys in this room.

623
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,764
Most of them guards.
But all of them were bitten

624
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,047
trying to get this man
handcuffed to the cot.

625
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,489
Now, our colonel
said he was the first one.

626
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,564
This colonel, is he around?

627
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,846
Oh, yeah. He's right here.

628
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,085
The guy who's shackled, do you know

629
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,004
who bit him, what bit him?

630
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,129
He was the base doctor.

631
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,122
<i>He'd just returned from the field.</i>

632
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,364
<i>He'd been sent out
to verify the death of a soldier</i>

633
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,727
<i>who had just gone AWOL
the week before.</i>

634
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,168
<i>Some villagers had found this guy</i>

635
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,891
<i>foaming at the mouth,
oozing some kind of black tar.</i>

636
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,802
<i>Then he tried to bite one of them.</i>

637
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,167
<i>They shot him, tied him up,
threw him in a barn.</i>

638
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,970
That's all we know, except the doctor

639
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,123
comes back here
and begins attacking his patients.

640
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,806
This soldier,
do you know where he came from?

641
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,041
No.

642
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:43,124
Anyone he might
have come in contact with?

643
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,201
No.

644
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,805
There's got to be records.

645
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,640
You are welcome
to take a look if you want.

646
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,566
Then the origin could
have come from anywhere.

647
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:56,961
It's a shame you had to fly

648
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,042
all the way out here to figure that out.

649
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,724
How did you all escape this?

650
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,327
The expenditure of ammunition.

651
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,643
Is that how you tweaked your leg?

652
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,369
No, shit's been bugging me a while.

653
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,210
This prick stands right in the mix,

654
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,645
while seven or eight of them

655
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,569
turn Zeke all at the same time.

656
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,722
But they got no time
for OI' Dirty Bastard here.

657
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,167
Biting everything like fat kids love Twix.

658
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,330
Got no time for his lucky ass.

659
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,084
Ain't it obvious I'm charmed?

660
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,449
The ones I saw bitten
turned in 12 seconds. Same here?

661
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,931
Five or 10 minutes.

662
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:39,368
Yeah, Davidson went
and he turned in 10 minutes.

663
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:40,841
"Stevie?"

664
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:44,288
"Captain Spekes! Oh, my God!
My God! My God! Are they eating me?"

665
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,921
Who's that?

666
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,724
Waste no time on that freak.

667
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,201
He's C.I.A.

668
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,203
Got caught selling guns to North Korea.

669
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,611
Davidson,

670
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:55,282
he turned in 10 minutes.

671
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,968
That doesn't sound viral
to me at all, sports fans!

672
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,729
You're with the C.I.A.?

673
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,725
But they're not with me.

674
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,530
And who are you?

675
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,764
Oh, my God!

676
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,448
Captain, put on the World Music!

677
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,444
The day

678
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,890
is saved!

679
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:28,801
Why'd you sell guns to the North?

680
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:29,961
Why not?

681
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,400
Are they surviving this?

682
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,686
Indeed they are.

683
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,250
Using your guns.

684
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:37,324
Guns are half-measures.

685
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,647
How then?

686
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,206
All right.

687
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,285
They took away

688
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:15,281
the Zekes' exponential power.

689
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:20,442
They pulled the teeth of all 23 million

690
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,123
in less than 24 hours.

691
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:31,603
The greatest feat
of social engineering in history.

692
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,565
It's brilliant.

693
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,206
No teeth,

694
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,571
no bite.

695
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,764
No great spread.

696
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,881
Bullshit.

697
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:48,527
More books,
fewer receptions, Boutros Boutros.

698
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,888
Now, why do you have to burn them

699
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,724
to ashes to get them to finally stop?

700
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,404
Why do they move like a plague?

701
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,209
Why is Israel winning?

702
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,850
How is Israel winning?

703
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,927
They sealed off their entire country

704
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,570
days before the undead attacked man.

705
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,371
First to know,

706
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,365
first to act.

707
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,881
People have been
building walls there for two millennia.

708
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,605
Mmm. Right. Yeah, but,

709
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,364
finish all those

710
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:19,091
thousands of years of work a week ago?

711
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,490
Impeccable timing is all.

712
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,764
You want answers?

713
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,449
Jurgen Warmbrunn.

714
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:35,485
That's the man
in Jerusalem you want to see.

715
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,006
You ever seen anything like that?

716
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,281
Hell, no.

717
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:42,682
We're going to Jerusalem.
I'm your co-pilot.

718
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,446
Oh, hang on.

719
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,284
Hang on. Hang on a minute.

720
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,606
- Hello?

721
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,366
Gerry?

722
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,203
- Honey?
<i>- Gerry, can you hear me?</i>

723
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,327
Karin?

724
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,320
Hello?

725
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,130
- God damn it!

726
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,524
Give me your hand.

727
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:23,567
No way. No.

728
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:24,926
My mother. Dallas.

729
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,571
Probably pacing a hole in the floor
right now if she's still there.

730
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:30,211
Better chance of you seeing
her before me, that's all.

731
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,760
It's a big plane. We got a lot of room.

732
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:35,844
Better the devil you know
than the one you don't.

733
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,965
You'll be all right.
Just pedal your ass off.

734
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,242
Make sure Maverick here keeps
the nose of that plane

735
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,446
pointed towards the sun.

736
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,763
Just remember, don't lock
the bowser's fuel line to the inlet.

737
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,365
Tell me 10 more times.

738
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,885
- You good?
- Right here.

739
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,008
All right. Don't rush.

740
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,405
We've got one chance
to fuel their plane, so let's do it right.

741
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,642
If you ain't a crack shot,
don't aim for the head,

742
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:57,767
just get Zeke on the ground.

743
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:01,003
Remember, "Spine's divine,
those knees they work just fine!"

744
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,844
Let's go, lights out!

745
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,527
<i>Alpha in position.</i>

746
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,648
<i>Bravo moving out.</i>

747
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:30,121
<i>Remember, these things
are drawn to sound.</i>

748
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:33,329
<i>So I need you close to target
before I bring you the truck.</i>

749
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,085
<i>Now there's only one way
we're getting you on that plane,</i>

750
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,248
<i>and that's quietly.</i>

751
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:08,887
- Shit!

752
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,769
God damn it!
Shut that thing off!

753
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,725
<i>Looks like we just woke the dead.</i>

754
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,001
<i>Out of respect for others,</i>

755
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,804
<i>please turn off all pagers
and cell phones.</i>

756
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,490
We got to move.

757
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,123
We've got to get out of here, let's move!

758
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:35,880
Go, go, go!

759
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,006
Whoo!

760
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,080
I'm gonna clear a path through Zeke!

761
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,650
You pedal like hell!

762
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,640
<i>Come on, boys,
I need head shots! Tap 'em out!</i>

763
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,449
<i>I want to see some Zeke on the ground!</i>

764
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,051
You're kidding me.
I'm a God damn Zeke.

765
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,846
<i>I got you, Captain. Just say the word.</i>

766
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:43,370
<i>It's all right, boys.
I got this one.</i>

767
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,370
- God damn it.
- We got enough!

768
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,843
We need to detach the fuel line!

769
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,562
Israel better pay off.

770
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,329
All right, I have instrument,
but only on single prop.

771
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,761
You'll have to talk me through it.

772
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:10,960
Okay, we're clear.

773
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,485
Okay. Give me all the lights.

774
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,850
Switch on the anti-icing.

775
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:17,921
- Where?
- The red knob.

776
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,441
- Got it, got it.
- Set up our heading 020 for departure.

777
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,241
- We got to move!
- Set flaps 15 degrees.

778
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,731
Flaps 15.

779
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,247
All right, we are all set.
Let's get out of here!

780
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,125
Make it steep.

781
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:52,605
- Gerry?
<i>- Hi, baby.</i>

782
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:53,761
Hi. Hi.

783
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,483
<i>I tried to call you.</i>

784
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,129
I know, I was...

785
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,887
It was bad timing, I was running around.

786
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,930
Are you okay?

787
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,880
<i>Yeah, every/thing's okay. I'm okay.</i>

788
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,085
That's the spirit.

789
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:16,726
Yeah.

790
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,646
Listen,

791
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,650
Korea didn't work out.

792
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,326
<i>Now it looks like
we're gonna have to go to Israel.</i>

793
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,528
Try to get some rest on the flight.

794
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:30,964
How are the kids?

795
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:32,601
Um...

796
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:35,811
I think...

797
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,960
<i>They're really... They're good.</i>

798
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,963
<i>I got Connie right here.</i>

799
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,161
Baby?

800
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,766
<i>Attention,
unidentified aircraft.</i>

801
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:18,083
<i>You are in a restricted airspace
and not clear for landing.</i>

802
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,682
Jerusalem tower, Reach 394.

803
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:22,888
<i>Pan, pan, pan.
Request immediate landing.</i>

804
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,486
<i>Contact Mossad,
office of Jurgen Warmbrunn.</i>

805
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,210
<i>Special Envoy, United Nations.</i>

806
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:41,081
Stay with the plane. Be ready to bug out.
I'll be back before dark.

807
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,051
<i>The problem
with most people is that</i>

808
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,804
<i>they don't believe
something can happen</i>

809
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,923
until it already has.

810
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,083
It's not stupidity or weakness.

811
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:47,004
It's just human nature.

812
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,365
How did you know?

813
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,125
Gerald Lane.

814
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,160
Wrote a self-defeating Jeremiad

815
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,403
about his employer,
the U.N., back in 2010.

816
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:03,250
Caused a few ripples.
Sidelined your career.

817
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:07,050
Thought you'd have parlayed
those ripples into a self-righteous book.

818
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,804
No nose for profit.

819
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,043
How did Israel know?

820
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:14,969
We intercepted a communique
from an Indian general

821
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:17,886
saying they were
fighting the <i>Rakshasha.</i>

822
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:20,566
Translation, zombies.

823
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,201
Technically undead.

824
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:27,405
Jurgen Warmbrunn.

825
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,881
High-ranking official in the Mossad.

826
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:34,962
Described as sober, efficient,
not terribly imaginative.

827
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:38,609
And yet you build a wall
because you read a communique

828
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:40,842
that mentions the word "zombie"?

829
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:45,681
Well, when put like that,
I'd be skeptical as well.

830
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:48,568
In the '30s, Jews refused to believe

831
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:51,166
they could be sent
to concentration camps.

832
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:55,684
In '72, we refused to fathom
we'd be massacred in the Olympics.

833
00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:00,290
In the month before October 1973,
we saw Arab troop movements,

834
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:03,125
and we unanimously agreed
they didn't pose a threat.

835
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:08,323
Well, a month later, the Arab attack
almost drove us into the sea.

836
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,361
So we decided to make a change.

837
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,640
A change?

838
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:15,485
The Tenth Man.

839
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,808
If nine of us
look at the same information

840
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,451
and arrive at the exact same conclusion,

841
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,205
it's the duty of the tenth man
to disagree.

842
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,086
No matter how improbable it may seem,

843
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,208
the tenth man has to start digging

844
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,567
on the assumption
that the other nine are wrong.

845
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:35,210
And you were that tenth man.

846
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,167
Precisely.

847
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:47,929
Since everyone assumed that this talk of
zombies was cover for something else,

848
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,083
I began my investigation
on the assumption

849
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:55,404
that when they said "zombies,"
they meant zombies.

850
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,130
Was patient zero from India?

851
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,686
That's the problem.

852
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,361
There's so many
potential sources in play

853
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,209
that no one knows where it began.

854
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,083
The organ trade in Germany.

855
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:10,281
Strange examples of violent behavior
across the Asian peninsulas.

856
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:14,926
Meanwhile, the zombie plague keeps
spreading, and we do what we can.

857
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:19,081
These are
the Jerusalem Salvation Gates.

858
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,685
Two of 10 portals

859
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,570
through the security perimeter
into fortified Israel.

860
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:30,929
You're letting people in.

861
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:34,443
Every human being we save
is one less zombie to fight.

862
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:17,971
It's okay.

863
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:48,526
If I could get into India, where
would I start? Who would I speak with?

864
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,523
India's a black hole.

865
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,602
Forget about patient zero.

866
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:55,206
I can't do that.
It's too late for me to build a wall.

867
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,928
I'm running out of time. I need specifics.

868
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,162
- I need answers...
- I don't have answers.

869
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,368
All you can do is find a way to hide.

870
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,210
Get troops down there.

871
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:28,765
It's too loud! It's too loud!

872
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,690
They're coming over the top!

873
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:47,888
- Shit!

874
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,003
<i>Command, we have a breach
at Salvation Gate.</i>

875
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:51,650
<i>They're coming over the wall!</i>

876
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:36,285
Get him to Jaffa Gate.

877
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:56,961
She'll get you out of here,
she'll get you to your plane!

878
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:23,610
Stay low!

879
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,250
Wrong way! Wrong way!

880
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:29,683
Go to landing point B.

881
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:32,886
Roger, we are inbound
to landing point B.

882
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:40,722
Hawk 5, almost there.
E.T.A. one minute.

883
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:44,646
<i>Hawk 5. Hawk 5,
you're patched in. Over.</i>

884
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,802
<i>This is Hawk 5. Listen carefully.</i>

885
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:50,608
<i>The city is breached,
and they're heading towards the airport.</i>

886
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:05,160
- One thousand one.

887
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:06,571
One thousand two.

888
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:08,927
One thousand three. One thousand four.

889
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,011
- One thousand five.

890
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,166
One thousand six.

891
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,245
One thousand seven.

892
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:18,931
One thousand eight.

893
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:24,166
We got to move.

894
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:36,446
You'll be all right.

895
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:39,407
You're not gonna turn.
You're not gonna turn!

896
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,291
We got to move.

897
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,204
- We got to move!

898
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,285
<i>5 going down.</i>

899
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:20,760
<i>Chopper 5 is down.</i>

900
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,370
<i>I say again, chopper 5 is down.</i>

901
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:24,249
<i>L.Z. is overrun.</i>

902
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:28,851
Tower, Reach 394.
Requesting immediate departure.

903
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,240
<i>Tower to 394.
Proceed to runway four.</i>

904
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:32,566
<i>Good luck out there.</i>

905
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:50,926
No!

906
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:56,169
There! That one!

907
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:04,765
Stop. Stop.

908
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:25,561
Go! Go!

909
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:40,045
Get them out of here!

910
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:47,764
Stay calm, please.
Stay calm.

911
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,808
Come on. Go, go, go.

912
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:07,801
What's your destination?

913
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:09,928
I don't know. We were headed here,
but I don't know.

914
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:19,209
I'm Gerry, by the way.

915
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:21,561
Segen.

916
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:23,686
Segen.

917
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:25,920
First or last?

918
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:28,411
Just Segen.

919
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:29,801
So, what we're doing,

920
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:31,644
we've got to change this bandage
and we're gonna clean it.

921
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:32,846
Okay?

922
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:38,963
You okay? Okay?

923
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:44,361
Okay.

924
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,329
Come on, gut up. Gut up.

925
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,131
Here we go.

926
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:55,241
We're almost there.

927
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:58,402
Okay. Big breaths.

928
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:01,486
Let's get this over fast. Big breaths.

929
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:03,561
Here we go.

930
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:10,088
Come on. Good.

931
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:13,083
Last step. Last step.

932
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:14,807
Big breath.

933
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:19,809
Good job. There it is. Okay.
Mmm-hmm.

934
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,731
Okay. Okay, I think you've earned this.

935
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:30,850
Very good. Okay.

936
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,365
You a doctor?

937
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:34,921
No.

938
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:36,964
I've had some training in the field.

939
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:40,042
How did you know?

940
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,281
Cutting it off...
How did you know it would work?

941
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:45,005
I didn't.

942
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:51,446
Now I'm just a liability.

943
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:55,645
<i>This prick</i>

944
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:58,087
stands right in the mix,

945
01:12:58,160 --> 01:12:59,366
while seven or eight of them

946
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,647
<i>turn Zeke all at the same time.</i>

947
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:03,609
<i>Is that how
you tweaked your leg?</i>

948
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:06,682
No, shit's been bugging me a while.

949
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:09,682
<i>Got no time for his lucky ass.</i>

950
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:13,531
<i>Now, the hard part
is seeing the crumbs</i>

951
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:15,250
<i>for the clues they are.</i>

952
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:19,363
And sometimes the thing you thought

953
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:22,848
was the most brutal aspect of the virus

954
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:26,600
<i>turns out to be the chink in its armor.</i>

955
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:28,206
<i>I don't have answers.</i>

956
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:34,004
<i>All you can do is find a way to hide.</i>

957
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:52,521
Gerry?

958
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:53,965
<i>Are you okay? Where are you, baby?
What's happening?</i>

959
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:55,121
I love you. I'm sorry.

960
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:56,401
<i>But you've got to get Thierry now.</i>

961
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:57,527
I'll find him.

962
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,608
- Thierry! Thierry.
- Excuse me. Karin.

963
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:04,080
Gerry needs you. I love you.

964
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:06,691
Gerry? Where are you?

965
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:08,281
On the last flight out.

966
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:10,408
Listen, my phone is dying
and I need some quick intel.

967
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:12,562
You gotta locate the closest
medical research facility.

968
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:15,450
A C.D.C., a W.H.O.,
something that makes vaccines.

969
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:17,640
<i>- And the closest airport to it.</i>
- I don't understand.

970
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:19,446
No time to explain.

971
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:20,601
<i>Just make it happen, man.</i>

972
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:21,841
Okay, okay.

973
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:24,890
But, Gerry,
I still don't know where you are.

974
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:32,480
Well, go and find out what he needs.

975
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:35,645
You're gonna want to take this.

976
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:38,566
Take it.

977
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:51,931
Your battery is dead.

978
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:56,125
We made contact
with Cardiff Airport, Wales.

979
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:58,362
Your people directed us.

980
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:01,171
There is W.H.O.
research facility nearby,

981
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:03,846
but they are not sure
it's still operational.

982
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:05,126
This is location.

983
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:06,931
Can we make it?

984
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:18,088
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your Captain.</i>

985
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:20,601
<i>I'm glad to report that
we are on our final approach</i>

986
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:22,330
<i>to Cardiff Airport in Wales.</i>

987
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:25,131
<i>All European airports
are under lockdown.</i>

988
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:29,285
<i>But we have been given
priority status and cleared for landing.</i>

989
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:32,045
<i>We will be allowed to disembark.</i>

990
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:35,327
<i>We are very, very lucky.</i>

991
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:02,242
Hey. Who do you belong to?

992
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:07,401
What's there?

993
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:08,561
- What is it?

994
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,807
You... Bags.

995
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:17,889
We need trolley and bags.

996
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:25,121
Mayday, mayday, mayday!
Bravo 160 heavy.

997
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:26,725
Emergency descent!

998
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:19,726
Prepare for impact.

999
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:37,211
Got to move.

1000
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:45,611
Come on, come on.

1001
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:08,251
Give me something good.

1002
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:10,721
Sir, Cardiff Airport
lost contact with the plane.

1003
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,087
Lane is M.I.A. I'm sorry, sir.

1004
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:30,600
<i>Chopper inbound
for immediate relocation.</i>

1005
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:31,920
<i>I say again.</i>

1006
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,571
<i>All non-essential personnel
given F-6 status</i>

1007
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:37,211
<i>need to report for immediate relocation.</i>

1008
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:40,560
Ma'am?

1009
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:42,849
Thierry would like a word with you.

1010
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:51,243
Captain, it's only been 48 hours.

1011
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:54,847
He's a resourceful man. There's every
chance he could have survived.

1012
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:58,003
Sir, I gave him my word
we would look after his family.

1013
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,050
Yes, sir. I understand.

1014
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:07,568
Okay. Let's go. We're good.

1015
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:55,440
<i>Daddy!</i>

1016
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:08,250
<i>Daddy!</i>

1017
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:09,681
Daddy!

1018
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,082
You're a tough bastard.

1019
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:19,491
And a lucky one.

1020
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:21,650
Who are you?

1021
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:26,603
I came here with a... With a woman.

1022
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:29,007
Is she still...

1023
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:33,168
Who are you?
Why have you come here?

1024
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:39,285
Why do you keep looking at him?

1025
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:42,762
'Cause he's the one in charge.

1026
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,445
You know what this place is?

1027
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:50,769
Of course I do. That's why I'm here.

1028
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:53,366
Then you understand
how this must look to us.

1029
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:56,046
This

1030
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:58,443
is important to you?

1031
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:01,721
- How long have I been out?
- Three days.

1032
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,206
Give me the phone.

1033
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:04,731
Just give me the phone.

1034
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,128
Give me the God damn phone!
Give me the phone!

1035
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:09,043
As soon as you answer my question.

1036
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:12,041
Call it.

1037
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:15,361
Call the number,
they'll tell you who I am. Call it.

1038
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:27,607
<i>Gerry?</i>

1039
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:30,247
- Yeah, I'm here. I'm here.
<i>- My God.</i>

1040
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:32,365
We thought you were dead.

1041
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:33,851
<i>Gerry, where are you?</i>

1042
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:36,248
Thierry, I'm with
a couple of nervous gentlemen.

1043
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:37,890
<i>They need some bona fides
before I can speak with you.</i>

1044
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,047
Of course.

1045
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:41,290
<i>This is Thierry Umutoni.</i>

1046
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:44,202
Deputy Secretary-General.
United Nations.

1047
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:46,244
<i>To whom am I speaking?</i>

1048
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:47,641
Where's Karin?

1049
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:50,842
Thierry, why didn't Karin answer?

1050
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:57,241
I'm sorry, Gerry.

1051
01:28:57,680 --> 01:28:59,011
<i>I did what I could.</i>

1052
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:02,766
What does that mean?

1053
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:04,569
You've got to calm down.
No, stop! Stop.

1054
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:06,290
You're going to hurt yourself.

1055
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:26,121
You're okay.

1056
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:31,564
His family has been sent
to a refugee camp in Nova Scotia.

1057
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:34,284
I'm sure they'll be safe.

1058
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:38,485
Are you? Thierry told you
who I am and what I used to do, right?

1059
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:39,641
Yeah.

1060
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:41,961
Then trust me when
I tell you they're not safe.

1061
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:46,091
I understand how you feel.

1062
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:47,885
- Do you? Yes?
- Yes.

1063
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:49,810
Do you have a family?

1064
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:52,245
- No.
- No.

1065
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:55,331
Then you couldn't possibly understand,
could you?

1066
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:58,447
I lost my son and wife in Rome.

1067
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:02,920
Rather, I lost my son to

1068
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:07,484
something that had once been my wife.

1069
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:13,161
We have all lost someone, Mr. Lane.

1070
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:16,408
In your case, there is hope at least.

1071
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:17,811
I'm sorry.

1072
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:20,806
I'm sorry.

1073
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:22,211
Now,

1074
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:25,009
why did you come here?

1075
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,082
What do you need from us?

1076
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:30,484
Your worst disease.

1077
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:36,091
He wants a what?

1078
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:37,690
Deadly pathogen.

1079
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:39,964
With a high mortality rate.

1080
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:43,126
- But curable.
- Okay, well...

1081
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:45,567
You'd want a bacteria
rather than a virus,

1082
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:46,926
I would think. Typhus?

1083
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:49,205
Meningitis. Scarlet Fever.

1084
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:50,560
Rocky Mountain Fever.

1085
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:53,361
Anyway, excuse me, what's this for?

1086
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:57,486
Mr. Lane believes we can use
such a disease against the undead.

1087
01:30:57,720 --> 01:31:01,202
I would give you points
for originality, Mr. Lane,

1088
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:03,203
if we hadn't already
tried that, first thing.

1089
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:09,043
One of the many things a virus or
bacteria needs to thrive is a live host.

1090
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:10,605
A functioning circulatory system.

1091
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:12,848
I'm afraid it boils down
to one simple fact...

1092
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:14,604
You can't make a dead person sick.

1093
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:17,605
It's not for them.

1094
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:19,850
It's for us.

1095
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:23,961
I believe these things have a weakness.

1096
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:26,603
And that weakness is weakness.

1097
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:28,770
- Our weakness.

1098
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:31,241
I have witnessed them
literally bypass people.

1099
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:34,085
Walk right around them like
a river around a rock. Why?

1100
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:37,207
I think, because those people were sick.

1101
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:39,091
I think they were terminal.

1102
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:40,571
And these things could sense it.

1103
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:43,002
I think they're spreading a pathogen,

1104
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:44,809
and they need a healthy host.

1105
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:47,168
But even if you're right, I mean,
infecting the populace

1106
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:49,447
with a lethal illness
is not exactly a cure.

1107
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:52,400
It's not a cure. It's camouflage.

1108
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,365
It's camouflage.

1109
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:03,769
There's a natural precedent.

1110
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:07,487
Hungry predators
will avoid diseased bodies.

1111
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:10,526
Equipped with the right pathogen,
our troops

1112
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:12,887
would be essentially
invisible to the enemy.

1113
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:16,964
You understand the only way
to prove this theory of yours is

1114
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:18,891
for some idiot to infect themselves

1115
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:20,849
with a lethal pathogen and then...

1116
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:24,970
...meet with her, face to face.

1117
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:29,406
Yes.

1118
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:32,162
Do we have what we need to try it?

1119
01:32:32,240 --> 01:32:33,720
We have all he could want.

1120
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:36,806
Typhus, H1N1, SARS.

1121
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:39,090
The problem is,

1122
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:41,208
they're all stored in B-Wing.

1123
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:43,889
What's the matter with B-Wing?

1124
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:48,483
Dr. Spellman.
Our chief vaccinologist.

1125
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:52,605
Within hours of the outbreak,
he'd been sent blood samples

1126
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:54,887
to try and isolate the pathogenic cause.

1127
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:00,250
Unfortunately...

1128
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:06,131
This is B-Wing now.

1129
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:14,889
God damn it.

1130
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:20,406
How many?

1131
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,441
How many are there?

1132
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:24,363
There were 80 people working there.

1133
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:30,849
I've never seen them move like that.

1134
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:32,206
They're dormant.

1135
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:34,682
They're awaiting stimulus.

1136
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:36,881
Now, this

1137
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:39,365
is vault 139.

1138
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:41,729
That's where your samples would be.

1139
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:45,327
This is the skybridge.

1140
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:48,927
That connects B-Wing
to the main building here.

1141
01:33:49,880 --> 01:33:54,169
And this, is the only thing
standing between us and the skybridge.

1142
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:55,401
So,

1143
01:33:57,200 --> 01:33:59,043
what do you propose, Mr. Lane?

1144
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,650
You are not serious.

1145
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:19,088
B-Wing's a maze.
They'll never make it back alone.

1146
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:21,443
We don't even know
if his theory is correct.

1147
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:24,444
Well, I know I'm not asking
one of you to take him there.

1148
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:28,604
Each has its merits.

1149
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:35,886
- Last resort.
- It's too loud.

1150
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:39,241
Let's go.

1151
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:42,965
Try not to kill one.

1152
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:48,082
It only makes
the rest of them more aggressive.

1153
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:50,281
Yeah.

1154
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:08,885
You sure you want to do this?

1155
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:11,768
Of course I'm not. Let's go.

1156
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:13,641
Good luck.

1157
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,650
See you all shortly.

1158
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:22,966
Good luck.

1159
01:35:26,440 --> 01:35:30,331
If anything comes down this hall before
we do, you seal these doors for good.

1160
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:32,528
Understood?
- Okay.

1161
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:00,565
There they are.

1162
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:41,481
Go, go.

1163
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:58,406
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.

1164
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:00,001
Come on!

1165
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:24,883
They're fine. They're fine.

1166
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:00,491
Shit.

1167
01:40:23,880 --> 01:40:26,087
The vault we need is in 139.

1168
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:03,921
Go!

1169
01:41:08,440 --> 01:41:09,771
Oh, my God.

1170
01:41:16,120 --> 01:41:17,610
Left, left, left!

1171
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:20,651
What are you doing?

1172
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:22,490
She'll get you to the vault.

1173
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:40,886
That's the vault.

1174
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:42,291
- We can make it.
- No, we can't.

1175
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:46,210
We can't make it. Let's go!

1176
01:43:11,800 --> 01:43:12,847
They're not gonna make it.

1177
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:14,524
You heard what Javi said,
we cannot open it.

1178
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:15,965
They're not alone, we can't open it!

1179
01:43:16,040 --> 01:43:17,405
They are coming back!

1180
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:21,283
We can't leave them there.

1181
01:43:21,720 --> 01:43:22,846
Come on!

1182
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:27,090
Open the door!

1183
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:30,971
- Run!
- Run!

1184
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:33,646
Run! Faster, come on!

1185
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:34,921
Run!

1186
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:37,610
In, in, in!

1187
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:45,325
Come on!

1188
01:43:46,120 --> 01:43:47,963
Now where is Gerry?

1189
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:52,447
Where is he, where is he, where is he?

1190
01:43:53,880 --> 01:43:56,087
Come on, come on, where are you?

1191
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:11,484
<i>5-6-9-6-4.</i>

1192
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:15,127
5-6-9-6-4.

1193
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:45,605
What happened to Gerry?

1194
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:02,080
Not that one. Not that one.

1195
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:32,566
Oh, shit!

1196
01:46:32,640 --> 01:46:33,721
Shit!

1197
01:46:56,200 --> 01:46:57,361
Jesus.

1198
01:46:58,120 --> 01:46:59,804
He's going to inject himself.

1199
01:47:06,040 --> 01:47:08,042
We have no idea
which one's going to work.

1200
01:47:08,120 --> 01:47:10,487
We don't know if any of them will work.

1201
01:47:11,080 --> 01:47:13,526
If he uses anything
he took from that left case,

1202
01:47:14,360 --> 01:47:15,850
he's dead anyway.

1203
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:43,045
What's he doing?

1204
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:35,883
How long does he have to wait?

1205
01:48:36,360 --> 01:48:38,886
Before he's infected? Not long, but,

1206
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:41,611
that's not the question
we're really asking, is it?

1207
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:33,931
Look at them.

1208
01:50:55,080 --> 01:50:56,684
He just walked right past him!

1209
01:51:02,600 --> 01:51:03,931
He walked right past him!

1210
01:51:04,720 --> 01:51:06,085
- Like it was nobody!

1211
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:17,801
Okay.

1212
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:07,570
<i>This isn't the end.</i>

1213
01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:18,646
<i>Not even close.</i>

1214
01:53:18,720 --> 01:53:20,927
<i>Hi, there. This is...</i>

1215
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:22,604
<i>This is Amy. Is anyone out there?</i>

1216
01:53:22,680 --> 01:53:24,560
<i>Hello. I'm trying
to get in contact with anyone.</i>

1217
01:53:24,600 --> 01:53:26,682
<i>We've had some luck
finding people with this transmission.</i>

1218
01:53:26,760 --> 01:53:28,364
<i>We've lost entire cities.</i>

1219
01:53:28,440 --> 01:53:30,761
<i>When there's
no more people left to infect,</i>

1220
01:53:30,840 --> 01:53:33,002
<i>they go dormant. Whole cities are lost.</i>

1221
01:53:33,080 --> 01:53:34,600
<i>The World Health Organization</i>

1222
01:53:34,640 --> 01:53:36,529
<i>reports today that help may soon...</i>

1223
01:53:36,600 --> 01:53:38,602
<i>...a hybridized
meningitis strain</i>

1224
01:53:38,680 --> 01:53:41,001
<i>with components of smallpox and H1N1.</i>

1225
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:42,764
<i>We still don't
know how it started.</i>

1226
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:44,490
<i>The World Health
Organization has created</i>

1227
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:47,450
<i>a vaccine that works
as a kind of camouflage,</i>

1228
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:51,002
<i>making people who receive it
invisible to the infected.</i>

1229
01:53:51,320 --> 01:53:52,526
<i>We bought ourselves some time.</i>

1230
01:53:52,600 --> 01:53:55,046
<i>Volunteer forces
are delivering the vaccine</i>

1231
01:53:55,120 --> 01:53:57,122
<i>to areas that have been cordoned off.</i>

1232
01:53:57,200 --> 01:53:59,965
<i>Distribution efforts
began in earnest on April 10th...</i>

1233
01:54:00,040 --> 01:54:01,405
<i>The importance
of getting the information</i>

1234
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:03,648
<i>out to those still alive
within the quarantine...</i>

1235
01:54:04,600 --> 01:54:06,284
<i>But it's given us a chance.</i>

1236
01:54:22,720 --> 01:54:24,563
<i>If you
can get to a colder area,</i>

1237
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:26,608
<i>to higher ground,
they move slower on the ground.</i>

1238
01:54:26,760 --> 01:54:29,650
<i>The Battle
of Moscow is still raging.</i>

1239
01:54:29,960 --> 01:54:32,804
<i>Initial tests
on the so-called camouflage</i>

1240
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:34,609
<i>have been largely successful.</i>

1241
01:54:39,480 --> 01:54:41,801
<i>Others have found
a way to push back.</i>

1242
01:54:42,640 --> 01:54:46,087
Move, move!
All right, juice 'em up!

1243
01:54:54,760 --> 01:54:57,081
<i>Approaching target.
Permission to engage.</i>

1244
01:54:57,440 --> 01:54:58,771
<i>Permission granted.</i>

1245
01:54:58,840 --> 01:55:01,366
<i>All clear.
Light 'em up. Light 'em up.</i>

1246
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:04,326
<i>It's permanent!</i>

1247
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:07,609
<i>It's settled, it's settled! It's over with!</i>

<i>There's no forgiveness in hell!</i>

<i>Whatever goes to hell, stays in hell!</i>

<i>Head north if you can.</i>

1254
