1
00:00:37,089 --> 00:00:41,958
"Disturb not the harmony of
Fire, Ice or Lightning."

2
00:00:42,161 --> 00:00:47,394
"Lest these Titans wreak destruction
upon the world in which they clash."

3
00:00:48,801 --> 00:00:53,397
"Though the water's great guardian
shall arise to quell the fighting."

4
00:00:53,639 --> 00:00:58,804
"Alone its song will fail.
Thus the earth shall turn to ash."

5
00:01:00,112 --> 00:01:06,517
"Oh Chosen One. Into thine hands,
bring together all three."

6
00:01:07,686 --> 00:01:13,318
"Their treasures combined
tame the beast of the sea."

7
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,922
Now it...begins.

8
00:01:19,498 --> 00:01:24,902
Analysis indicates that the 'Titan of Fire'
referred to in the ancient inscription...

9
00:01:25,003 --> 00:01:27,130
is the legendary Pokémon Moltres,

10
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:31,801
believed to have originated
in a remote region of the Orange Islands.

11
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:37,644
The 'Titan of Lightning ' is the Pokémon
Zapdos...and Articuno is the 'Titan of Ice. '

12
00:01:38,417 --> 00:01:42,478
Historical documents confirm
that the three legendary Pokémon...

13
00:01:42,588 --> 00:01:47,582
are unique species found only
in the vicinity of Shamouti Island.

14
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:53,164
Moltres, Zapdos and Articuno...

15
00:01:53,866 --> 00:01:57,927
Any one of them would be
a priceless addition to my collection...

16
00:01:58,103 --> 00:02:04,133
but together, they are the three keys
that unlock the ultimate treasure.

17
00:02:04,243 --> 00:02:06,803
Pokémon matching subject parameters...

18
00:02:06,912 --> 00:02:10,279
Moltres, Articuno, Zapdos...detected.

19
00:02:10,749 --> 00:02:12,239
Then let's get started.

20
00:02:17,389 --> 00:02:18,720
Which one is nearest?.

21
00:02:18,824 --> 00:02:21,054
The Fire Pokémon, Moltres.

22
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,252
Good.

23
00:03:49,681 --> 00:03:51,740
Now the chase is on!

24
00:04:24,816 --> 00:04:28,411
Well I've taken the first piece
without much difficulty.

25
00:04:28,687 --> 00:04:31,121
It's like a simple game of chess.

26
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:38,120
Next I'll capture Zapdos, and Articuno soon
after and that will flush out the 'king.'

27
00:04:38,864 --> 00:04:43,392
And then... That's when the game
is going to get interesting.

28
00:04:44,036 --> 00:04:48,939
"Bring together all three.
Their treasures combined tame..."

29
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:52,875
"the beast of the sea."...Lugia!

30
00:05:37,489 --> 00:05:39,650
Another perfect day in paradise.

31
00:05:39,758 --> 00:05:45,856
The weather:. warm. The breezes:. balmy.
The water:. calm and crystal clear.

32
00:05:45,964 --> 00:05:49,331
Even Pokémon trainers deserve
a break on a day like today...

33
00:05:49,434 --> 00:05:52,028
and as our heroes sail
through the Orange Islands,

34
00:05:52,137 --> 00:05:54,935
Ash Ketchum dreams of
his next big adventure.

35
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,566
Little does he know
it will be his greatest!

36
00:06:00,645 --> 00:06:01,509
Nice day.

37
00:06:01,613 --> 00:06:04,480
It's beautiful...right Togepi?!.

38
00:06:05,817 --> 00:06:09,378
Hey Ash you think we have time
to give the Pokémon a little fresh air?.

39
00:06:09,554 --> 00:06:10,748
Sure Tracey.

40
00:06:10,856 --> 00:06:15,020
It'll take us about an hour to get to
the next island. There's plenty of time!.

41
00:06:15,761 --> 00:06:18,025
Well, what are we waiting for!?.

42
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,758
We're way off course.

43
00:09:37,963 --> 00:09:39,430
That's Shamouti?.

44
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:42,122
We're right in the middle of
the end of the Orange lslands.

45
00:10:03,555 --> 00:10:04,351
An island!

46
00:10:04,456 --> 00:10:05,388
In a storm!

47
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,481
I've seen this movie!.

48
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,992
Do we have carp insurance?.

49
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,922
We're about to be...

50
00:10:14,099 --> 00:10:15,066
Fillet of fish!??!.

51
00:10:40,592 --> 00:10:44,221
Good morning, Delia!
Well you certainly do have a green thumb!.

52
00:10:44,329 --> 00:10:45,853
Oh thanks, Professor!

53
00:10:45,964 --> 00:10:48,956
But the truth is I've been getting
a lot of help with my garden lately...

54
00:10:49,067 --> 00:10:50,830
the weather's been just beautiful!

55
00:10:50,969 --> 00:10:54,598
Well this is the time of year
when the sun shines every day!

56
00:11:15,093 --> 00:11:17,288
Say that was awfully strange.

57
00:11:17,395 --> 00:11:19,659
And it passed by so quickly...

58
00:11:20,465 --> 00:11:22,831
Oh my...it looks like snow!.

59
00:11:24,402 --> 00:11:26,267
It is snow!.

60
00:11:27,372 --> 00:11:30,830
But this is summer. How can it snow?.

61
00:11:31,342 --> 00:11:33,242
I... I don't know.

62
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,474
What is it Mimey?!.

63
00:12:14,753 --> 00:12:16,584
Mr.Mime is very upset.

64
00:12:16,688 --> 00:12:19,623
Yes...and so are the other Pokémon.

65
00:12:20,191 --> 00:12:23,183
Pokémon are more in tune
with nature than we are.

66
00:12:23,294 --> 00:12:25,660
When something goes wrong...
they can sense it.

67
00:12:25,764 --> 00:12:29,723
And I'm afraid something somewhere
is going terribly wrong.

68
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,044
We sure are lucky.

69
00:12:43,148 --> 00:12:46,345
If we hadn't found this place
we'd be in real trouble.

70
00:12:48,453 --> 00:12:50,751
I think we still might be!

71
00:13:04,102 --> 00:13:06,195
How are you?.

72
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,872
It's been a while.

73
00:13:10,175 --> 00:13:13,235
Carol I can't believe it!
It's great to see you!

74
00:13:13,611 --> 00:13:15,806
What're you doing
back on Shamouti lsland?.

75
00:13:15,914 --> 00:13:18,007
We got caught up in that storm
and floated in!

76
00:13:18,116 --> 00:13:20,550
And it looks like we got here
at the perfect time!

77
00:13:20,652 --> 00:13:23,678
You're right! The annual
Legend Festival starts today!

78
00:13:23,788 --> 00:13:26,188
This is my favorite island holiday!

79
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:27,883
Are you gonna be
the star of the show again?.

80
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:31,256
No I'm too old to be
the Festival Maiden anymore...

81
00:13:31,362 --> 00:13:34,763
So this year my little sister's gonna
take over for me...wonder where she...

82
00:13:34,866 --> 00:13:35,924
I'm right here.

83
00:13:37,068 --> 00:13:39,593
The only one not wearing
some stupid costume!.

84
00:13:39,704 --> 00:13:43,003
You'd think after a few centuries
you'd alI've outgrown this dorky ritual!

85
00:13:43,308 --> 00:13:46,869
It's our tradition...
you should be honored to take part!

86
00:13:46,978 --> 00:13:49,947
Don't worry... I'll play
my role in the big 'legend.'

87
00:13:50,048 --> 00:13:52,278
I've only seen
you do it like a zillion times!

88
00:13:52,383 --> 00:13:53,372
Just be there!

89
00:13:53,484 --> 00:13:57,511
Well unfortunately that's my little sister
...her name's Melody...

90
00:13:57,622 --> 00:14:01,149
but don't get fooled...
she's not always this adorable.

91
00:14:01,492 --> 00:14:02,083
Who's this?.

92
00:14:02,193 --> 00:14:05,890
Oh sorry...this is Ash Ketchum,
he's a Pokémon Trainer.

93
00:14:05,997 --> 00:14:08,124
POKÉMON TRAlNER?!.

94
00:14:11,169 --> 00:14:13,933
The ancient legend foretells your arrival,

95
00:14:14,038 --> 00:14:17,064
and only with you
can the Guardian of the Waters...

96
00:14:17,175 --> 00:14:20,804
vanquish the great titans of
Fire, lce and Lightning.

97
00:14:21,813 --> 00:14:24,941
"ln your hands...oh Chosen One..."

98
00:14:25,316 --> 00:14:27,409
"...in your hands
rests the world and its fate!."

99
00:14:27,518 --> 00:14:29,042
It does?.!

100
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:33,151
Don't let it worry you kid...
it's just for the tourists!

101
00:14:34,359 --> 00:14:36,520
You're a Pokémon Trainer huh?.

102
00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:41,997
I guess he'll do...
Here's your traditional...welcome kiss.

103
00:14:47,038 --> 00:14:48,505
Are you his little sister?.

104
00:14:48,606 --> 00:14:49,903
I am not!

105
00:14:50,008 --> 00:14:52,533
Then I guess you must be...his girlfriend?.

106
00:14:52,644 --> 00:14:53,576
That's gross!

107
00:14:53,678 --> 00:14:58,411
Oh I don't think so. I'll be glad
to play for him at the legend banquet.

108
00:14:58,616 --> 00:14:59,514
Starts around 8.

109
00:15:00,385 --> 00:15:03,821
Oh and Misty try not to get jealous.

110
00:15:05,356 --> 00:15:08,416
We have found our Chosen One!

111
00:15:51,502 --> 00:15:54,835
Hurry Hurry! Deep fried Festival Cakes,
get them while they're hot!

112
00:16:02,513 --> 00:16:05,744
And she says, "No, but I have Krabbys!"

113
00:16:10,154 --> 00:16:13,487
It's ridiculous...me Ash's girlfriend!

114
00:16:15,293 --> 00:16:17,193
It's totally ridiculous!.

115
00:16:17,729 --> 00:16:21,722
I can't wait to see what my part
in the Legend ceremony is gonna be!

116
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:42,013
Ash that's her?.
The girl we met on the beach!

117
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,178
Melody.

118
00:16:43,287 --> 00:16:44,515
Melody!.?.

119
00:16:58,903 --> 00:17:00,803
Hm she's a big show off!

120
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:16,352
Hear Ye All! From the trio of islands,
ancient spheres shall you take...

121
00:17:16,454 --> 00:17:19,946
For between life and death
all the difference you'll make.

122
00:17:20,658 --> 00:17:24,992
Oh Chosen One! You must climb
to the shrine to right what is wrong.

123
00:17:25,096 --> 00:17:27,690
And the world will be healed
by the guardian's song.

124
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:28,989
What do I do?.

125
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,567
I just told you, Ash!

126
00:17:30,668 --> 00:17:34,365
Yeah I heard all that stuff but...
what do I have to do?!.

127
00:17:34,472 --> 00:17:37,441
Oh it won't be very hard Ash...
not for you...

128
00:17:37,542 --> 00:17:40,909
and besides almost all
the Chosen Ones come back alive!

129
00:17:41,112 --> 00:17:42,545
Melody!.

130
00:17:44,115 --> 00:17:47,516
All you have to do is get
these glass balls from three islands...

131
00:17:47,652 --> 00:17:51,645
One from Fire lsland, one from lce lsland
and one from Lightning lsland,

132
00:17:51,756 --> 00:17:54,190
And you bring them
to the shrine back here.

133
00:17:54,525 --> 00:17:58,461
And then...
I celebrate by playing this song.

134
00:18:02,633 --> 00:18:04,828
Then it's over... Oh Chosen One!

135
00:18:04,936 --> 00:18:07,131
Do I get to wear a cool costume?.

136
00:18:08,072 --> 00:18:10,131
Sorry but it's just come as you are...

137
00:18:13,111 --> 00:18:18,139
Besides...you look perfect to me...
the handsomest Chosen One in years!

138
00:18:18,483 --> 00:18:21,077
OK...get me a boat and I'm ready!

139
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:23,949
Oh there's no hurry...
you have all day tomorrow.

140
00:18:24,055 --> 00:18:28,014
Tonight's just for the party!
Stay...have some fun!

141
00:18:28,126 --> 00:18:30,117
Well some things're
more important than fun!

142
00:18:30,228 --> 00:18:34,858
I'm Ash the Chosen One!
This is serious. I gotta be responsible.

143
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,062
That's a switch.

144
00:18:38,436 --> 00:18:42,805
You know what?. I like your attitude!.
We can take my boat Ash!

145
00:18:42,907 --> 00:18:45,068
Then let's go! You coming Misty?.

146
00:18:45,243 --> 00:18:49,077
No thanks...if you want somebody to do
whatever you want whenever you want...

147
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,410
you should find yourself a girlfriend!

148
00:18:54,018 --> 00:18:55,178
Pikachu?.!

149
00:18:56,287 --> 00:18:57,447
Pikachu?.!

150
00:19:00,758 --> 00:19:02,658
Hey give me back my hat!

151
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:15,868
Our ship is ruined!

152
00:19:15,973 --> 00:19:17,372
I'm sick over it!

153
00:19:17,475 --> 00:19:19,705
I'm seasick over it!

154
00:19:37,695 --> 00:19:38,389
Wasn't that...

155
00:19:38,496 --> 00:19:39,258
...the twerp!

156
00:19:39,363 --> 00:19:40,728
And Pikachu too.

157
00:19:54,412 --> 00:19:59,975
"Disturb not the harmony of
Fire, lce or Lightening."

158
00:20:04,255 --> 00:20:06,018
What a mess.

159
00:20:21,706 --> 00:20:26,473
I hope the Legend Ceremony
doesn't include...a funeral!

160
00:20:30,514 --> 00:20:34,450
This storm's bad...what if those two
can't make it to the island...

161
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:36,711
Carol I have to take your boat!

162
00:20:36,821 --> 00:20:38,755
But Melody what can you do?.

163
00:20:38,923 --> 00:20:42,188
They're caught in this storm
because of our stupid ritual...

164
00:20:42,293 --> 00:20:44,454
and I'm the one who picked Ash for it.

165
00:20:45,129 --> 00:20:47,154
I just hope they're alright.

166
00:21:02,046 --> 00:21:03,604
What are you coming for?!.

167
00:21:03,714 --> 00:21:05,909
To find Ash...and before you start saying.

168
00:21:06,017 --> 00:21:09,214
It's because I secretly like him DON'T...
'cause I don't!

169
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,279
Hey chill out...you sure are sensitive
about somebody who's not your boyfriend!

170
00:21:13,391 --> 00:21:17,885
He's NOT my boyfriend! He's a boy and
he's a friend but he's not a boyfriend!

171
00:21:17,995 --> 00:21:19,587
You talking about me?.

172
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,238
What we won't do...

173
00:21:37,348 --> 00:21:38,747
for Pikachu!

174
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:54,154
"Disturb not the harmony of
Fire, lce or Lightning."

175
00:21:55,733 --> 00:22:00,102
It seems there's been a shift...
in the balance of power.

176
00:22:01,205 --> 00:22:04,174
Pokémon Zapdos detected.

177
00:22:08,479 --> 00:22:10,504
Experts now believe
that the weather disasters...

178
00:22:10,614 --> 00:22:12,343
occurring in all parts of the globe...

179
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:15,510
are due to a powerful
and previously unknown phenomenon...

180
00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:18,019
from deep beneath
the surface of the ocean.

181
00:22:19,056 --> 00:22:21,718
This is a simulation of
the 'underwater river'...

182
00:22:21,826 --> 00:22:23,817
that has snaked its way
around the planet,

183
00:22:23,928 --> 00:22:28,126
disrupting ocean currents, weather
patterns, and the entire global climate.

184
00:22:28,265 --> 00:22:32,133
I wonder if this is what's
been upsetting all the Pokémon.

185
00:22:33,003 --> 00:22:35,062
The source of the disturbance
appears to be centered...

186
00:22:35,172 --> 00:22:37,367
at the north central region
of the Orange Islands...

187
00:22:37,475 --> 00:22:38,942
The Orange lslands?!.

188
00:22:39,043 --> 00:22:42,444
But that's where Ash and
his friends are right now!

189
00:22:43,981 --> 00:22:45,175
Someone's calling.

190
00:22:47,017 --> 00:22:48,917
Professor we're having problems.

191
00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:50,384
What is it, Professor lvy!?.

192
00:22:50,488 --> 00:22:53,753
The Pokémon here are
behaving very strangely.

193
00:22:59,964 --> 00:23:01,295
It looks like the storm's over.

194
00:23:01,399 --> 00:23:03,264
But the sea keeps getting rougher!

195
00:23:38,202 --> 00:23:39,533
The rudder!

196
00:24:05,729 --> 00:24:07,526
At least we made it, but...

197
00:24:08,132 --> 00:24:09,929
Pikachu, where're you going?!.

198
00:24:10,034 --> 00:24:12,502
Ash we shouldn't split up,
the storm might kick up again!

199
00:24:14,238 --> 00:24:17,901
Pikachu's been acting really weird!
I gotta find out why!

200
00:24:28,752 --> 00:24:30,049
OK hold on guys!

201
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:39,987
Cool move.

202
00:24:40,097 --> 00:24:43,089
I've been around boats all my life.
You don't have to be scared.

203
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,069
I never get scared out in the ocean.
I come from a Water Pokémon gym.

204
00:25:40,858 --> 00:25:43,418
Hey! Are you guys OK?.!

205
00:25:43,527 --> 00:25:47,361
Yeah we're fine...but I think
the boat's in pretty bad shape!

206
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:48,590
Where's Ash?.

207
00:25:48,699 --> 00:25:50,098
Up there!

208
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,402
We're slipping!

209
00:26:17,528 --> 00:26:18,688
It flies?!.

210
00:26:22,032 --> 00:26:23,294
If you know how!

211
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:23,889
Awesome!

212
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:24,990
Hang on!

213
00:26:29,573 --> 00:26:30,767
Let's find Ash!

214
00:26:30,874 --> 00:26:34,435
Yeah, and if he needs any help...
his girlfriend's here.

215
00:26:34,545 --> 00:26:35,375
But I'm not!

216
00:26:35,479 --> 00:26:38,471
Well like you said you are a girl
and you are his friend...

217
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:40,382
Isn't that right?!.

218
00:26:51,462 --> 00:26:54,488
Poor Moltres, you seem so miserable.

219
00:26:55,499 --> 00:26:58,935
But they say misery loves company.

220
00:27:02,339 --> 00:27:04,807
Zapdos approaching Fire Island.

221
00:27:09,246 --> 00:27:10,372
Pikachu!

222
00:27:21,091 --> 00:27:22,023
Hey look!

223
00:27:22,126 --> 00:27:23,115
There they are.

224
00:27:23,227 --> 00:27:25,252
I can't believe our luck.

225
00:27:25,763 --> 00:27:26,525
Pikachu...

226
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:28,222
We'll get you!

227
00:28:02,499 --> 00:28:04,330
The ancient sphere!.

228
00:28:35,365 --> 00:28:37,663
Guess who...Pikachu!

229
00:28:38,769 --> 00:28:39,497
Was that...?.

230
00:28:40,437 --> 00:28:43,167
Prepare for more trouble
than you've ever seen...

231
00:28:43,273 --> 00:28:45,673
And make it double,
we're on the big screen!

232
00:28:45,776 --> 00:28:47,641
I'll get this on video!

233
00:28:48,612 --> 00:28:51,376
I'm in a hurry, here...
and the weather's looking bad.

234
00:28:51,482 --> 00:28:54,417
It has been bad.
Isn't that always our luck?.

235
00:28:54,718 --> 00:28:57,812
But our luck changed.
And our ship has finally come in!

236
00:29:11,535 --> 00:29:13,469
Well I hope you're happy Mr.Hero!

237
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:15,504
If you just listened to me
in the first place and...

238
00:29:15,606 --> 00:29:17,267
stayed at the party like I told you to,

239
00:29:17,374 --> 00:29:19,638
we wouldn't be stranded out
here on this island.

240
00:29:19,743 --> 00:29:21,267
Welcome to my world.

241
00:29:21,378 --> 00:29:24,677
I have to deal with
his stubborn attitude every single day.

242
00:29:24,915 --> 00:29:26,041
Oh you'll get used to it...

243
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:27,811
it's just something
you're gonna need to work on...

244
00:29:27,918 --> 00:29:29,579
when the two of you get married.

245
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,652
Take that back!

246
00:29:30,754 --> 00:29:33,018
Listen to me kid,
when you get involved...

247
00:29:33,123 --> 00:29:35,990
with the opposite sex
you're only asking for trouble.

248
00:29:36,093 --> 00:29:39,290
Yes and that's the kind of trouble...
I stay out of.

249
00:29:39,396 --> 00:29:42,524
You don't need the opposite sex...
'cause you got each other!

250
00:29:42,633 --> 00:29:44,328
What does that mean?.

251
00:29:51,675 --> 00:29:54,041
Pikachu...it's Zapdos!

252
00:30:22,639 --> 00:30:24,197
Pikachu no!

253
00:30:29,913 --> 00:30:31,278
Are you OK?!.

254
00:31:02,846 --> 00:31:07,112
Pikachu's pretty tough...but Zapdos
isn't even feeling its attacks.

255
00:31:07,217 --> 00:31:11,881
Those aren't attacks Jessie.
Pikachu's trying to talk to Zapdos!

256
00:31:12,256 --> 00:31:16,022
It's saying, "What're you doing
over here on Fire lsland, Zapdos?"

257
00:31:16,126 --> 00:31:17,320
"And where's Moltres?"

258
00:31:17,427 --> 00:31:18,826
Good question.

259
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:35,640
Translation!

260
00:31:35,746 --> 00:31:36,610
What's it saying?.!

261
00:31:36,713 --> 00:31:39,079
It's saying "Moltres used to rule here."

262
00:31:39,182 --> 00:31:43,118
"But now that Moltres is gone,
Lightning shall rule over fire..."

263
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:46,815
"and I claim this island
as my own from this day forward."

264
00:31:47,124 --> 00:31:49,217
I guess Moltres flew the coop!

265
00:32:36,139 --> 00:32:39,336
Absorbing Zapdos's electrical energy.

266
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:45,409
Drained of it's power...Zapdos will be
too weak to resist capture...

267
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,168
Once I've captured Articuno...

268
00:33:41,071 --> 00:33:43,733
the real prize would appear.

269
00:34:07,431 --> 00:34:13,063
Codo Blue Three. When capturing Zapdos,
we collected...something more.

270
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:14,159
More?.

271
00:34:22,012 --> 00:34:23,377
Zapdos...

272
00:34:23,847 --> 00:34:25,314
and Moltres!

273
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:35,358
Hey what's this?!. "Disturb not
the harmony of Fire, lce or Lightning."

274
00:34:35,459 --> 00:34:38,826
"Lest these Titans wreak destruction
upon the world in which they clash."

275
00:34:49,906 --> 00:34:54,434
Well this certainly is a pleasure...
though an unexpected one.

276
00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:56,311
What do you think?.

277
00:34:56,413 --> 00:35:00,611
Moltres, the Bird of Fire...
and Zapdos, the Bird of Lightning.

278
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:03,947
Of course without Articuno
it's not a complete set, but...

279
00:35:04,054 --> 00:35:05,214
That's disgusting!

280
00:35:05,322 --> 00:35:06,880
The way you talk it's like Pokémon...

281
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:09,652
are just things
to collect like dolls or stamps!

282
00:35:09,759 --> 00:35:11,158
What kind of trainer are you?!.

283
00:35:11,394 --> 00:35:17,333
I'm afraid I'm not a trainer young lady...
I am merely...a collector.

284
00:35:18,101 --> 00:35:22,731
I began my collection with a Mew card
and now I have all this.

285
00:35:23,373 --> 00:35:26,365
Legendary Pokémon have
always been my passion.

286
00:35:26,943 --> 00:35:30,208
And soon my collection itself
will be legendary!

287
00:35:30,914 --> 00:35:34,042
Sensors indicate
Articuno is changing course.

288
00:35:34,151 --> 00:35:36,551
And now you'll have to excuse me.

289
00:35:47,964 --> 00:35:50,432
The legend...could it be...

290
00:36:17,627 --> 00:36:20,187
Here's a map of the area
around Shamouti Island.

291
00:36:20,297 --> 00:36:24,233
The epicenter of the unprecedented
worldwide weather disasters,

292
00:36:24,334 --> 00:36:26,325
though their purpose is not yet clear...

293
00:36:26,436 --> 00:36:30,372
tens of thousands of Pokémon are now
making their way toward the island.

294
00:36:30,774 --> 00:36:35,643
Water Pokémon are coming by sea,
flying Pokémon are coming by air,

295
00:36:35,879 --> 00:36:40,213
and those unable to make the crossing are
massing on the land nearest the islands.

296
00:36:43,186 --> 00:36:46,212
With me now are Professor Samuel Oak
and Professor Philena Ivy...

297
00:36:46,323 --> 00:36:48,791
to help shed some light
on this phenomenon.

298
00:36:48,992 --> 00:36:51,893
Near Shamouti lie the islands
of Fire, lce and Lightning,

299
00:36:51,995 --> 00:36:55,761
home to the legendary birds Moltres,
Articuno and Zapdos.

300
00:36:55,966 --> 00:36:58,594
I fear that they are somehow involved.

301
00:36:58,768 --> 00:37:00,861
Ancient writings
from many different cultures...

302
00:37:00,971 --> 00:37:04,202
name this area, specifically
the islands of Fire and lce...

303
00:37:04,307 --> 00:37:08,641
as the cradle of the ocean...the source
if you will of all the waters of the world.

304
00:37:08,745 --> 00:37:11,578
This has been disputed
by scientists for centuries,

305
00:37:11,681 --> 00:37:13,706
but it does make some poetic sense...

306
00:37:13,817 --> 00:37:16,752
when you consider what forms
what combining Fire and lce.

307
00:37:16,987 --> 00:37:19,956
And...what about the island
of Lightning, Professor?.

308
00:37:20,056 --> 00:37:24,925
Well imagine if an imbalance of power
occurred between Lightning, lce and Fire.

309
00:37:25,028 --> 00:37:28,225
Here's potentially
how the underwater current has formed.

310
00:37:28,865 --> 00:37:30,492
If the balance between the powers of...

311
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,797
Zapdos, Articuno and Moltres
were somehow disrupted,

312
00:37:33,903 --> 00:37:36,929
it's conceivable that
a powerful underwater current,

313
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,974
this churning beast of the sea,

314
00:37:39,075 --> 00:37:43,136
could in fact emerge from this region
and ultimately flood the entire planet.

315
00:37:43,246 --> 00:38:00,562
<THIS PART WAS NOT DUBBED>
<NO SOUND ON ENGLlSH VERSlON>

316
00:38:00,897 --> 00:38:04,924
The Pokémon seem to be gathering because
they feel a sense of impending doom.

317
00:38:05,335 --> 00:38:08,964
Pokémon are acutely in tune
with the balance of nature.

318
00:38:09,072 --> 00:38:12,735
The urge to correct this imbalance
is causing them to gather,

319
00:38:12,842 --> 00:38:14,901
possibly to try to save the planet...

320
00:38:15,011 --> 00:38:17,775
though they may be unable
to do anything about it.

321
00:38:19,649 --> 00:38:21,139
And...who are you?.

322
00:38:21,818 --> 00:38:24,616
My son and his friends are travelling
in the Orange lslands...

323
00:38:24,721 --> 00:38:26,916
and if things get as bad as
Professor Oak says...

324
00:38:27,023 --> 00:38:29,082
I may never see my boy again.

325
00:38:29,192 --> 00:38:31,660
And Ash is the whole world...to me.

326
00:38:43,807 --> 00:38:45,638
I could use pants!

327
00:38:59,289 --> 00:39:00,688
Melody...

328
00:39:30,153 --> 00:39:33,020
Well this sure beats an inflight movie.

329
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:37,558
"Disturb not the harmony of
Fire, lce or Lightning."

330
00:39:37,894 --> 00:39:42,160
"Lest these Titans wreak destruction
upon the world in which they clash."

331
00:39:42,265 --> 00:39:44,460
What if the ancient legend's coming true!

332
00:39:44,567 --> 00:39:47,593
If it is true
all intelligent life will be destroyed.

333
00:39:47,704 --> 00:39:48,602
That's right!

334
00:39:48,705 --> 00:39:49,763
And I'll be...

335
00:39:49,873 --> 00:39:51,568
You will be thumbed.

336
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,934
We gotta do something.

337
00:39:53,042 --> 00:39:55,567
We have to set Moltres and Zapdos free!

338
00:39:55,678 --> 00:39:56,838
Yeah...But how?.

339
00:40:12,228 --> 00:40:14,492
Time to turn up the heat.

340
00:40:52,735 --> 00:40:55,329
I choose you...Charizard!

341
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,941
Fire and electricity aren't enough!

342
00:41:06,049 --> 00:41:08,574
We can't just give up.
We've gotta keep trying!

343
00:41:08,985 --> 00:41:13,149
Well if things are gonna start to
get ugly! We might as well try Weezing!

344
00:41:13,256 --> 00:41:14,484
Right! Go!

345
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,498
Come on ya big palooka,
get up and fight!

346
00:41:26,603 --> 00:41:28,036
Let's try Arbok!

347
00:41:31,174 --> 00:41:33,699
Now Arbok! Use your Poison Sting!

348
00:41:37,447 --> 00:41:40,439
Squirtle...Bulbasaur...I choose you!

349
00:41:52,896 --> 00:42:07,209
<THIS PART WAS NOT DUBBED>
<NO SOUND ON ENGLlSH VERSlON>

350
00:43:15,178 --> 00:43:19,638
Mayday...Mayday!. Prepare for
clash landing on Lightning Island.

351
00:44:43,232 --> 00:44:44,290
Look out!

352
00:44:58,448 --> 00:45:00,279
I'd hate to get burned by their fire.

353
00:45:00,383 --> 00:45:02,374
I'd hate to get zapped
by their lightning.

354
00:45:02,485 --> 00:45:04,715
I'd hate to get hit by their droppings!

355
00:45:56,105 --> 00:45:57,197
What's that sound!?.

356
00:45:57,907 --> 00:45:59,807
Quick, we may need this!

357
00:46:13,589 --> 00:46:15,079
Come on hurry!

358
00:46:28,571 --> 00:46:31,802
Take the treasure...and put it there.

359
00:46:32,208 --> 00:46:33,698
You can talk??!.

360
00:46:36,145 --> 00:46:37,339
Oh right.

361
00:46:59,702 --> 00:47:01,192
Fire lsland...

362
00:47:06,275 --> 00:47:08,209
Lightning lsland.

363
00:47:13,516 --> 00:47:14,676
So you're Ash...

364
00:47:16,118 --> 00:47:18,177
You're one treasure short.

365
00:47:18,287 --> 00:47:21,313
Yeah I know but...
how'd you know my name?.

366
00:47:48,551 --> 00:47:50,109
Guardian help!

367
00:48:09,472 --> 00:48:12,703
The great guardian...Lugia!

368
00:48:13,209 --> 00:48:15,006
I can't believe it!

369
00:48:17,113 --> 00:48:18,171
Lugia!?!.

370
00:48:30,593 --> 00:48:31,753
That sound!

371
00:48:40,503 --> 00:48:42,596
Finally...my prize!

372
00:48:43,572 --> 00:48:50,535
It's magnificent. The 'Beast of
the Sea' will soon belong to me.

373
00:49:43,766 --> 00:49:46,929
"Though the Guardian of the Sea
shall arise to quell the fighting."

374
00:49:47,036 --> 00:49:51,473
"Alone its song will fail.
Thus the earth shall turn to ash!"

375
00:49:52,341 --> 00:49:54,332
This looks bad.

376
00:50:44,693 --> 00:50:48,129
What're Ash and his friends doing out
in this terrible weather?!.

377
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:49,197
I'm worried about them!

378
00:50:49,298 --> 00:50:51,698
Save a little worry for us!

379
00:50:51,801 --> 00:50:55,532
The fate of our planet is what we
should really be worried about...

380
00:50:55,738 --> 00:50:58,263
and the Pokémon know that
better than any of us.

381
00:51:26,168 --> 00:51:27,863
There's only one hope...

382
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:31,337
Only the Chosen One can
bring together the treasures...

383
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,670
to help the water's great guardian.

384
00:51:33,776 --> 00:51:35,903
But the legend says its song will fail!

385
00:51:36,011 --> 00:51:38,775
"...And thus the earth
shall turn to ash."

386
00:51:38,881 --> 00:51:40,940
But how are we ever
gonna find the Chosen One...

387
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:42,745
if we don't even know where to look?.

388
00:51:42,852 --> 00:51:46,083
It's right in the legend!...
"the earth shall turn to Ash!"

389
00:51:46,188 --> 00:51:48,019
Ash...it's talking about you!

390
00:51:48,524 --> 00:51:50,856
I'm the...Chosen One!?.

391
00:51:53,929 --> 00:51:57,956
Whoa wait a minute...
training Pokémon is tough enough,

392
00:51:58,067 --> 00:52:00,797
but saving the world is way too hard!

393
00:52:01,137 --> 00:52:03,332
I know it doesn't sound easy, Ash...

394
00:52:03,439 --> 00:52:08,308
but you're the only one who matches
the legend perfectly. What do you say?.

395
00:52:08,611 --> 00:52:12,479
Well right now I wish my mom
had named me Bob instead of Ash.

396
00:52:12,581 --> 00:52:18,144
Ash this whole thing is my fault... I...
I never should've dragged you into this.

397
00:52:18,454 --> 00:52:21,014
Well I guess
I gotta go along with that.

398
00:52:21,123 --> 00:52:23,956
Don't blame yourself.
Ash always gets us into trouble.

399
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:26,152
Yeah, but nothing like this!

400
00:52:26,762 --> 00:52:30,562
Lugia...the sound it makes is
just like the song from the legend!

401
00:53:07,269 --> 00:53:12,104
This song...the song has
restored my strength.

402
00:53:12,975 --> 00:53:18,106
But it alone cannot bring harmony
to the three warring ones.

403
00:53:18,214 --> 00:53:19,238
What do you mean?!.

404
00:53:19,481 --> 00:53:23,440
When the treasures of Fire, Ice
and Lightning are aligned,

405
00:53:23,552 --> 00:53:26,112
my song shall harmonize
with their powers

406
00:53:26,322 --> 00:53:30,088
and tame the beasts both above,
and below the sea.

407
00:53:30,192 --> 00:53:34,993
But this can come to pass
only with the help of the Chosen One...

408
00:53:35,097 --> 00:53:37,327
But what can I do
that somebody else can't?.

409
00:53:37,433 --> 00:53:40,368
Only in the hands of
the true Chosen One...

410
00:53:40,469 --> 00:53:45,065
will the Ice sphere glow
like the others, its power awakened.

411
00:53:47,142 --> 00:53:49,576
I have to go...there?.

412
00:53:49,745 --> 00:53:55,411
The choice is yours.
You must go only where your heart leads.

413
00:53:55,851 --> 00:53:57,318
Maybe l...

414
00:54:08,464 --> 00:54:09,795
I can?.

415
00:54:15,037 --> 00:54:17,369
You think so too?.

416
00:54:18,774 --> 00:54:20,241
Okay...

417
00:54:25,648 --> 00:54:29,482
I'll do whatever it takes
to get that third treasure...

418
00:54:30,052 --> 00:54:34,819
but what if I mess up...what if l?.

419
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:36,350
You can do it.

420
00:54:36,458 --> 00:54:37,686
We know you can.

421
00:54:38,794 --> 00:54:42,286
Yeah you're right I CAN do it!
I'm the Chosen One!

422
00:54:45,401 --> 00:54:49,428
Right now I feel more
like the Frozen One!

423
00:54:55,077 --> 00:54:57,238
Maybe they got the wrong Ash.

424
00:55:13,696 --> 00:55:18,065
This is a lot better than walking
Pikachu. We'll be there is no time now!

425
00:55:19,868 --> 00:55:21,267
Good luck Ash.

426
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:29,334
He's always the hero.

427
00:55:29,445 --> 00:55:31,072
We're always a zero.

428
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:34,513
We could be heroes too
if we ever caught a break.

429
00:56:07,583 --> 00:56:09,073
I've got an idea!

430
00:57:13,315 --> 00:57:15,476
We'll never get there now.

431
00:57:25,194 --> 00:57:26,752
Who could that be?.

432
00:57:27,196 --> 00:57:29,460
If that kid thinks
we're here for trouble...

433
00:57:29,565 --> 00:57:32,090
we're certainly going
to burst his bubble!

434
00:57:32,201 --> 00:57:34,897
Instead of causing tribulation...

435
00:57:35,003 --> 00:57:37,403
we're undergoing a transformation!

436
00:57:37,506 --> 00:57:40,236
Though it's way
outside our usual range...

437
00:57:40,342 --> 00:57:43,106
we're going to do
something nice for a change!

438
00:57:43,378 --> 00:57:44,140
Jessie!

439
00:57:44,246 --> 00:57:45,110
James!

440
00:57:45,214 --> 00:57:48,672
Up till now, Team Rocket's
been quite unscrupulous!

441
00:57:48,784 --> 00:57:51,912
Being good guys for once
would be super-dupulous!

442
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:53,681
That's ri-ight.

443
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:56,753
What're they doing here?.

444
00:58:06,969 --> 00:58:07,936
You wanna help?!.

445
00:58:08,036 --> 00:58:08,900
Of course!

446
00:58:09,004 --> 00:58:10,631
We don't want the world destroyed!

447
00:58:10,739 --> 00:58:12,172
Even if we survived....

448
00:58:12,274 --> 00:58:14,333
There would be nobody left
to steal from!

449
00:58:14,443 --> 00:58:15,808
We'd be out of work!!

450
00:58:15,911 --> 00:58:20,007
Come to think of this...when was
the last time we had a vacation?.

451
00:58:20,115 --> 00:58:24,848
We'll be on a permanent vacation, if we
don't get to that island. Let's do it!

452
00:58:31,994 --> 00:58:33,154
Evasive maneuvers!

453
00:58:33,262 --> 00:58:34,593
On the double!

454
00:58:59,821 --> 00:59:00,810
Up there!

455
00:59:59,381 --> 01:00:01,440
Okay...you got the third treasure.

456
01:00:01,550 --> 01:00:03,780
Now come on,
let's get back to the island!

457
01:00:03,885 --> 01:00:04,510
Right!

458
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:06,212
I almost forgot!

459
01:00:45,427 --> 01:00:46,951
Come on let's go!

460
01:01:02,744 --> 01:01:03,540
The treasure...?.

461
01:01:03,645 --> 01:01:05,044
I got it!

462
01:01:07,015 --> 01:01:08,175
Get on.

463
01:01:08,784 --> 01:01:09,842
Pikachu!

464
01:01:13,021 --> 01:01:14,648
DON'T LEAVE WlTHOUT US!

465
01:01:32,207 --> 01:01:33,970
Hold on tight!.

466
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:47,511
We're slowing Lugia down,
the three of us are too heavy!

467
01:01:47,622 --> 01:01:48,850
Let's try Weight Watchers!

468
01:01:48,957 --> 01:01:50,185
It's too late for that now!

469
01:01:50,292 --> 01:01:53,819
I heard it's never too late
if you really stick to the program!

470
01:01:58,033 --> 01:02:00,558
If we don't let go
they may not make it back!

471
01:02:00,669 --> 01:02:03,103
Let's protect the world
from devastation!

472
01:02:03,205 --> 01:02:04,968
Guess we gotta let go!

473
01:02:05,073 --> 01:02:06,267
Are you guys ready?.

474
01:02:06,374 --> 01:02:07,705
Let's do it!

475
01:02:09,244 --> 01:02:10,006
What're you doing?!.

476
01:02:10,178 --> 01:02:13,306
Team Rocket's blasting off
for goooooood!

477
01:02:13,615 --> 01:02:15,480
Team Rocket!

478
01:02:16,918 --> 01:02:18,545
Think we did the right thing?.

479
01:02:18,653 --> 01:02:22,555
I know we did the right thing Jessie.
and it feels great.

480
01:02:22,657 --> 01:02:24,522
Well this is it, then.

481
01:02:24,626 --> 01:02:26,025
Let's not say "goodbye!"

482
01:02:26,128 --> 01:02:27,322
Let's just say...

483
01:02:27,429 --> 01:02:28,623
"we're gonna die!"

484
01:02:45,614 --> 01:02:49,141
Lugia, why're all
those Pokémon down there?.

485
01:02:49,317 --> 01:02:53,617
Because they feel they must be here
in case they are needed.

486
01:02:58,794 --> 01:03:00,921
But what could they do to help?.

487
01:03:01,096 --> 01:03:04,327
They are not sure,
and that is why they are here.

488
01:03:04,432 --> 01:03:05,330
What do you mean?.

489
01:03:05,433 --> 01:03:07,901
That just one Pokémon
could help the world...

490
01:03:08,003 --> 01:03:11,268
would be worth the journey
for thousands of them any day.

491
01:03:11,373 --> 01:03:15,434
But this day, the one that can
make all the difference...is you.

492
01:03:25,353 --> 01:03:26,513
Please hurry.

493
01:03:26,755 --> 01:03:30,521
Let's hope the... Iegend is...true.

494
01:03:45,774 --> 01:03:50,837
Soon, Lugia you will be mine
and my destiny will be fulfilled at last.

495
01:04:46,701 --> 01:04:49,568
I have failed.

496
01:05:05,253 --> 01:05:06,481
Here...take this.

497
01:05:07,889 --> 01:05:10,949
Legend or not...
Ash can't do this alone.

498
01:05:17,065 --> 01:05:20,831
You'll have to play Lugia's song.
I'll go look for him.

499
01:05:21,736 --> 01:05:24,330
And Ash is never really alone
'cause he's got...

500
01:05:25,106 --> 01:05:26,038
me.

501
01:05:40,121 --> 01:05:41,452
Ash!

502
01:05:46,161 --> 01:05:48,721
Pikachu...just hang on!

503
01:06:02,143 --> 01:06:03,303
Ash!

504
01:06:16,758 --> 01:06:18,589
Come on Ash...breathe!

505
01:06:18,693 --> 01:06:20,183
You've got to.

506
01:06:22,130 --> 01:06:24,826
Please Ash, please, you can't...

507
01:06:28,436 --> 01:06:29,767
The sphere...?!.

508
01:06:35,877 --> 01:06:36,969
Ash...!

509
01:06:39,347 --> 01:06:42,145
Let me go! I've gotta do this!

510
01:07:14,849 --> 01:07:16,180
He made it!

511
01:07:17,419 --> 01:07:19,979
Have you brought
the final treasure, Ash?.

512
01:07:20,121 --> 01:07:21,748
Here it is Slowking!

513
01:07:22,090 --> 01:07:24,422
You must be the one to place it!

514
01:08:26,488 --> 01:08:27,750
The song.

515
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,898
And as you can see
from these live pictures,

516
01:13:08,002 --> 01:13:12,336
the severe weather that's caused havoc
around the globe has finally ended.

517
01:13:26,521 --> 01:13:29,319
The beast of the sea has been tamed.

518
01:13:29,424 --> 01:13:33,485
The fate of the world could not
have been in better hands.

519
01:13:56,884 --> 01:13:59,352
Ash! Ash!

520
01:14:03,925 --> 01:14:05,051
Oh...my lamega!

521
01:14:05,393 --> 01:14:06,826
It's my mom!

522
01:14:10,731 --> 01:14:14,724
All right...start talking!
You are in big trouble Mister!

523
01:14:14,836 --> 01:14:18,397
But...Mrs.Ketchum Ash just
helped save the whole world!

524
01:14:18,506 --> 01:14:22,772
Oh he did, did he!?....
Well I could've lost my whole world!

525
01:14:23,878 --> 01:14:27,279
Every day I worry about you
and wonder if you're all right.

526
01:14:27,548 --> 01:14:31,746
I know I can't stop you...from doing
the things you need to do.

527
01:14:31,853 --> 01:14:34,845
I just can't help missing you
all the time.

528
01:14:36,057 --> 01:14:39,618
You're a Pokémon trainer,
and that's just how it is...

529
01:14:40,528 --> 01:14:45,556
But next time, could you try to save
the world just a little closer to home?.

530
01:14:46,634 --> 01:14:48,568
I guess l...could give it a try.

531
01:14:48,936 --> 01:14:54,203
And remember, every day,
you're my hero.

532
01:14:56,544 --> 01:14:57,875
Thanks Mom!

533
01:15:10,558 --> 01:15:12,025
We've got to get back to Pallet Town...

534
01:15:12,126 --> 01:15:14,924
and tell the other Pokémon
researchers about this.

535
01:15:15,196 --> 01:15:16,254
Come on!

536
01:15:26,207 --> 01:15:31,770
How it all began...
and how I'll begin again.

537
01:15:44,625 --> 01:15:46,286
Who'd believe it?.

538
01:15:46,394 --> 01:15:48,419
For once we were heroes!

539
01:15:48,529 --> 01:15:50,292
Too bad nobody saw us.

540
01:15:50,398 --> 01:15:52,059
Guess again.

541
01:15:54,669 --> 01:15:57,604
What...did you...say?.

542
01:15:57,772 --> 01:16:00,935
Lots of people saw
what you did out there...

543
01:16:01,042 --> 01:16:03,909
and all of them are
watching you right now.

544
01:16:04,011 --> 01:16:07,071
Oh...then I guess the bad guys...

545
01:16:07,181 --> 01:16:08,079
are finally...

546
01:16:08,182 --> 01:16:09,342
good guys!

547
01:16:09,650 --> 01:16:11,117
So then we're not bad!

548
01:16:11,218 --> 01:16:12,116
That's good!

549
01:16:12,219 --> 01:16:13,686
What if the Boss finds out?.

550
01:16:13,788 --> 01:16:14,550
That's bad!

551
01:16:14,655 --> 01:16:15,917
We'll start our own Team.

552
01:16:16,023 --> 01:16:16,819
That's good!

553
01:16:16,924 --> 01:16:18,186
But we got no money.

554
01:16:18,292 --> 01:16:18,986
That's bad!

555
01:16:19,093 --> 01:16:20,492
Then we'll just steal some!

556
01:16:20,595 --> 01:16:23,462
That's good! Or is that bad?.
