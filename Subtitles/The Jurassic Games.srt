3
00:00:40,815 --> 00:00:43,230
A startling verdict
in what many are calling

4
00:00:43,232 --> 00:00:46,273
the most controversial
murder trial in years.

5
00:00:46,275 --> 00:00:49,525
Anthony Tucker found guilty
of first degree murder.

6
00:00:58,275 --> 00:01:00,023
My client maintains
his innocence.

7
00:01:00,025 --> 00:01:01,563
We have no comment at this time.

8
00:01:01,565 --> 00:01:02,565
How could you
do that to your wife?

9
00:01:13,357 --> 00:01:15,980
Anthony Tucker, I am
honored to formally invite you

10
00:01:15,982 --> 00:01:18,480
to participate as a
contestant on this year's

11
00:01:18,482 --> 00:01:20,313
Jurassic Games.

12
00:01:20,315 --> 00:01:21,482
Do you accept?

13
00:01:26,315 --> 00:01:27,150
Yes.

14
00:01:34,857 --> 00:01:37,355
In entertainment news,
this year's contestants

15
00:01:37,357 --> 00:01:39,480
for the Jurassic Games
have been chosen.

16
00:01:39,482 --> 00:01:41,023
I don't even care
about the contestants,

17
00:01:41,025 --> 00:01:43,771
I wanna see the hot host and
what he's gonna be wearing

18
00:01:43,773 --> 00:01:46,313
and saying, that's
what I wanna watch.

19
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:47,648
Ooh, I can't wait!

20
00:02:25,482 --> 00:02:27,980
It feels real, doesn't it?

21
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:29,815
The sand on your skin.

22
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:34,648
The sun on your face,
the taste in your mouth.

23
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,023
Well to all of you this
world is absolutely real.

24
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:41,688
The danger is real
and the pain is real.

25
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,400
But so is the reward.

26
00:02:44,315 --> 00:02:46,398
Oh, oh, be careful with that.

27
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,150
I'll need you to do
as I say or boom.

28
00:02:53,065 --> 00:02:57,063
You all know that
when you die in here,

29
00:02:57,065 --> 00:02:58,482
you die for real.

30
00:02:59,732 --> 00:03:02,273
All of you are in
here for one reason.

31
00:03:02,275 --> 00:03:03,940
To win your freedom.

32
00:03:04,857 --> 00:03:05,775
To go home.

33
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,355
You can avoid the death you
justly deserve by surviving,

34
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,438
by fighting, by
confronting your fears

35
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,775
and proving your worthiness.

36
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,605
Your goal is to be
the sole survivor.

37
00:03:19,607 --> 00:03:21,730
Find yourself the last
man or woman standing

38
00:03:21,732 --> 00:03:23,938
and you will win a full
pardon, you will go home,

39
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,940
free, alive, exonerated.

40
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,105
Now it will be tempting
to kill each other,

41
00:03:31,107 --> 00:03:32,398
there's no rules against that,

42
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,605
but please if you
would be so kind,

43
00:03:34,607 --> 00:03:36,605
try to leave at least
some of you alive

44
00:03:36,607 --> 00:03:38,188
for the main attraction.

45
00:03:39,275 --> 00:03:41,107
Oh, did you feel that?

46
00:03:42,732 --> 00:03:44,023
A few miles beyond the tree-line

47
00:03:44,025 --> 00:03:46,105
your first objective awaits.

48
00:03:46,107 --> 00:03:48,813
A temporary safe zone.

49
00:03:48,815 --> 00:03:51,231
Now your collars will
alert you when you arrive.

50
00:03:51,233 --> 00:03:53,647
Red, you're too far
away, yellow means

51
00:03:53,649 --> 00:03:56,147
you're getting closer, and
green means you have reached

52
00:03:56,149 --> 00:04:00,150
the safe zone and completed
your first challenge.

53
00:04:01,483 --> 00:04:04,813
Reach the safe zone in
one hour or you die.

54
00:04:04,815 --> 00:04:06,563
Die here in the
game and as you know

55
00:04:06,565 --> 00:04:08,731
you will die in real
life by lethal injection

56
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:11,898
as been assigned by the state.

57
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,606
The pain you feel in this
world will be real pain.

58
00:04:15,608 --> 00:04:17,188
Like the real pain you inflicted

59
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,563
on those that you have killed.

60
00:04:19,565 --> 00:04:21,188
Everyone understand?

61
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,606
Good.

62
00:04:22,608 --> 00:04:25,481
Congratulations to you all.

63
00:04:25,483 --> 00:04:28,688
As of right now, you are no
longer death row inmates.

64
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:33,148
You are contestants on the
greatest game show in the world,

65
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,023
the Jurassic Games!

66
00:05:02,858 --> 00:05:04,063
Oh shit.

67
00:05:04,065 --> 00:05:05,731
Did I mess up my hair?

68
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:06,731
No, it's good?

69
00:05:06,733 --> 00:05:07,563
Okay.

70
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,273
Alright guys, you ready?

71
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:10,106
How long until we're live?

72
00:05:10,108 --> 00:05:11,023
Live in 10.

73
00:05:11,025 --> 00:05:12,525
Okay.

74
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:20,188
Alright everyone,
we're going live in three, two...

75
00:05:21,565 --> 00:05:24,523
They have less than 59
minutes to reach the safe zone.

76
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:27,523
So sit back, try to relax and
enjoy, ladies and gentlemen.

77
00:05:27,525 --> 00:05:30,231
Because today is going
to be a hell of a day

78
00:05:30,233 --> 00:05:33,106
for our brave contestants.

79
00:05:48,233 --> 00:05:49,688
So far so good.

80
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:53,356
I mean that lineup
is gorgeous on camera.

81
00:05:53,358 --> 00:05:54,731
I'm telling you right
now we are hitting

82
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:56,438
all the key demographics.

83
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,898
It's a great cast.

84
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,650
It's the best one yet.

85
00:06:01,315 --> 00:06:03,106
Stay on the cannibal.

86
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,688
Stay outta my way,
you piece of shit!

87
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:26,688
I'm sorry!

88
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,150
Please don't hurt me, please!

89
00:06:45,108 --> 00:06:46,150
This is real!

90
00:06:47,025 --> 00:06:49,148
I can taste you!

91
00:06:53,565 --> 00:06:55,188
Our contestants
are frantically

92
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,063
trying to find the safe zone.

93
00:06:57,065 --> 00:06:58,981
Don't worry, I'm sure
most of them will.

94
00:06:58,983 --> 00:07:03,023
But in the end, nine will
die and one will win.

95
00:07:03,025 --> 00:07:07,063
And this year's four stages
are by far the best ever.

96
00:07:07,065 --> 00:07:08,563
Stage one.

97
00:07:08,565 --> 00:07:10,938
The contestants must survive
being hunted by hungry dinosaurs

98
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,023
long enough to find the
temporary safe zone.

99
00:07:14,025 --> 00:07:15,606
Stage two.

100
00:07:15,608 --> 00:07:17,063
The maze.

101
00:07:17,065 --> 00:07:19,648
A deadly labyrinth filled with
some of our fan favorites.

102
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,856
That's right, the raptors
are back this year.

103
00:07:22,858 --> 00:07:25,731
Stage three, the minefield.

104
00:07:25,733 --> 00:07:27,563
Tread lightly and you
might walk out of this game

105
00:07:27,565 --> 00:07:29,938
with all your limbs.

106
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,440
And our final stage this year?

107
00:07:34,315 --> 00:07:38,106
You don't actually think I'm
gonna give that away, do you?

108
00:07:38,108 --> 00:07:41,231
Let's just say you
won't be disappointed.

109
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:42,648
So stay tuned, fans!

110
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:46,233
Because the Jurassic
Games start right now!

111
00:07:49,315 --> 00:07:51,106
In the
ultimate reality game show,

112
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,938
10 death row inmates must
survive a virtual world

113
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:59,356
filled with the deadliest
predators to ever roam the earth.

114
00:07:59,358 --> 00:08:04,313
William Davis, guilty on 23
counts of drug-related homicide.

115
00:08:04,315 --> 00:08:06,814
Ren Saizo, contract killer.

116
00:08:06,816 --> 00:08:10,064
Guilty of the murder of
a United States senator.

117
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:11,939
Victor Gonzalez, The Wasp.

118
00:08:11,941 --> 00:08:13,397
Leader of the Hive drug cartel.

119
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:15,730
Guilty of 35 counts of murder.

120
00:08:15,732 --> 00:08:16,730
Stephanie Rogers...

121
00:08:16,732 --> 00:08:17,897
Brian, status report.

122
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:20,023
Games on alpha online,
raptor AI online,

123
00:08:20,025 --> 00:08:22,939
prepping game zone beta,
prepping to disengage rex one.

124
00:08:22,941 --> 00:08:24,314
Security holding up?

125
00:08:24,316 --> 00:08:25,480
Airtight.

126
00:08:25,482 --> 00:08:26,480
46 attempts to
breach our firewall

127
00:08:26,482 --> 00:08:28,189
but so far none successful.

128
00:08:28,191 --> 00:08:29,398
And none will be.

129
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,148
Stay vigilant.

130
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,689
Back live in the studio in 10.

131
00:08:33,691 --> 00:08:34,525
Okay.

132
00:08:37,941 --> 00:08:40,564
We never know who,
we never know when.

133
00:08:40,566 --> 00:08:44,439
But sadly we had to say
goodbye to Dr. Eli Franklin.

134
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,105
The first contestant
to be eliminated

135
00:08:46,107 --> 00:08:49,105
in this year's Jurassic Games.

136
00:08:56,941 --> 00:08:59,939
Of course, we can't
feel too sorry for him.

137
00:08:59,941 --> 00:09:02,480
That guy liked to
blow people up.

138
00:09:02,482 --> 00:09:04,315
A lot.

139
00:09:11,275 --> 00:09:14,689
What's going
on with Dr. Franklin?

140
00:09:14,691 --> 00:09:15,816
Dr. Franklin?

141
00:09:16,775 --> 00:09:17,607
You okay?

142
00:09:20,107 --> 00:09:22,355
God, he's so weird.

143
00:09:22,357 --> 00:09:25,482
Hey wait, doc,
you forgot your bag!

144
00:09:28,982 --> 00:09:30,980
I don't know about
you, but honestly

145
00:09:30,982 --> 00:09:33,648
he wasn't one of my
favorites anyway.

146
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:36,066
Only nine contestants remain.

147
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:21,064
Do you know where
the safe zone is?

148
00:10:21,066 --> 00:10:21,900
I'm lost.

149
00:11:06,775 --> 00:11:08,566
You're next, bitch!

150
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,732
What?

151
00:11:58,816 --> 00:12:01,650
You're kind of a
pussy, aren't you?

152
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,730
I'm not here to kill anybody.

153
00:12:08,732 --> 00:12:10,814
I'm here to kill everybody.

154
00:12:10,816 --> 00:12:11,983
Well, not you.

155
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:14,107
Not yet.

156
00:12:15,857 --> 00:12:16,732
Lighten up.

157
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:25,691
Come on, I think the safe
zone's this way and I'm scared.

158
00:12:37,816 --> 00:12:38,648
No more games!

159
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:39,689
No more games!

160
00:12:39,691 --> 00:12:40,525
No more...

161
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,900
Live in three, two.

162
00:12:56,816 --> 00:12:58,064
Thank you.

163
00:12:58,066 --> 00:12:59,648
I'm here with Bailey
and Andrew Tucker.

164
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:02,064
Thank you for taking the
time to meet with me.

165
00:13:02,066 --> 00:13:04,189
Bailey, let's start
with you, sweetheart.

166
00:13:04,191 --> 00:13:05,439
How do you feel
about your father

167
00:13:05,441 --> 00:13:08,898
being a contestant on
the Jurassic Games?

168
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,732
Um, this was his only
chance to get out, so.

169
00:13:14,025 --> 00:13:15,398
That's right.

170
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,898
If he wins, he will be
pardoned of all of his crimes.

171
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,564
He didn't commit any crimes.

172
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:21,064
And he didn't kill my mom!

173
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:23,439
Andrew stop, we're not
supposed to talk about it.

174
00:13:23,441 --> 00:13:25,023
It's alright.

175
00:13:25,025 --> 00:13:28,148
Your mother's death was tragic.

176
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,439
I'm very sorry she can't
be with you here today.

177
00:13:30,441 --> 00:13:32,105
Thank you.

178
00:13:32,107 --> 00:13:34,439
Is there anything you'd
like to say to your father?

179
00:13:34,441 --> 00:13:35,480
Look into this camera.

180
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,732
You can send him a message.

181
00:13:38,982 --> 00:13:40,940
Survive, Dad, please.

182
00:13:42,275 --> 00:13:43,523
We know you're innocent.

183
00:13:43,525 --> 00:13:44,605
Get him out of the games!

184
00:13:44,607 --> 00:13:46,440
- Stop the games!
- Andy.

185
00:13:47,441 --> 00:13:48,439
No more games!

186
00:13:48,441 --> 00:13:49,605
No more games!

187
00:13:49,607 --> 00:13:50,814
No more games!

188
00:13:50,816 --> 00:13:52,230
No more games!

189
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:53,689
No more games!

190
00:13:53,691 --> 00:13:55,148
No more games!

191
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,564
No more games!

192
00:13:56,566 --> 00:13:58,023
No more games!

193
00:13:58,025 --> 00:13:59,480
No more games!

194
00:13:59,482 --> 00:14:00,939
I can't believe they
made me talk to his kids.

195
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:02,773
They think he's innocent.

196
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:05,023
What difference does it make?

197
00:14:05,025 --> 00:14:07,230
Well, what if
they found proof?

198
00:14:07,232 --> 00:14:08,730
You think they'd let him go?

199
00:14:08,732 --> 00:14:10,605
If they find proof,
we'll never hear about it.

200
00:14:10,607 --> 00:14:11,605
Trust me.

201
00:14:11,607 --> 00:14:12,605
Let's go!

202
00:14:12,607 --> 00:14:13,982
Move, move, move!

203
00:14:22,107 --> 00:14:23,314
So how close are they?

204
00:14:23,316 --> 00:14:24,398
The audience is
getting restless.

205
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,980
A few minutes most,
but they're good hunters.

206
00:14:25,982 --> 00:14:27,230
I thought we could
build tension.

207
00:14:27,232 --> 00:14:28,480
Build tension?

208
00:14:28,482 --> 00:14:30,898
Our viewers don't care
about tension, Brian.

209
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,773
They just wanna see the
contestants die horribly.

210
00:14:33,775 --> 00:14:36,107
Spawn them closer next time.

211
00:14:39,607 --> 00:14:41,314
And stay on Tucker.

212
00:14:41,316 --> 00:14:43,480
The audience already is
sympathetic with him.

213
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,773
Let's watch him die live.

214
00:14:45,775 --> 00:14:46,857
You got it.

215
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,480
So your wife.

216
00:15:01,482 --> 00:15:03,523
She was tortured.

217
00:15:03,525 --> 00:15:05,355
Leave it alone.

218
00:15:05,357 --> 00:15:08,980
I wonder what she was
thinking when she died.

219
00:15:08,982 --> 00:15:11,523
Some people can
just turn it off.

220
00:15:11,525 --> 00:15:12,357
The pain.

221
00:15:13,482 --> 00:15:15,525
I've always admired that.

222
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,939
I read your cast bio.

223
00:15:19,941 --> 00:15:21,858
Loving daddy, good man.

224
00:15:23,066 --> 00:15:26,648
It's clear why the world
thinks you're innocent.

225
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:30,566
If it makes you feel any
better, I believe you.

226
00:15:31,816 --> 00:15:32,650
Goodie.

227
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:41,814
Get up!

228
00:16:27,107 --> 00:16:29,690
I'll see you in the next round.

229
00:16:38,525 --> 00:16:40,647
Go you little bitch.

230
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:41,938
Hey, you know what?

231
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,563
Can we get some wind,
just to make him sway

232
00:16:43,565 --> 00:16:45,438
a little bit?

233
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,065
Roll her package.

234
00:16:49,024 --> 00:16:50,272
Bloodthirsty.

235
00:16:50,274 --> 00:16:51,647
Merciless.

236
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:53,147
Psychopath.

237
00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:56,647
Words used to describe
Sarah Laforte.

238
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:57,981
The youngest death row inmate

239
00:16:57,983 --> 00:17:00,231
to ever enter the
Jurassic Games.

240
00:17:00,233 --> 00:17:02,356
I had the opportunity
to sit down with her

241
00:17:02,358 --> 00:17:07,275
and try to get inside the head
of this cold-blooded killer.

242
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,775
Sarah?

243
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,690
I just want to ask
you a few questions.

244
00:17:32,065 --> 00:17:32,900
Joy.

245
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,858
My friends call me Joy.

246
00:17:38,025 --> 00:17:40,688
Why do you prefer
to be called Joy?

247
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:43,525
Because I'm such
a happy person.

248
00:17:44,525 --> 00:17:45,400
Okay Joy.

249
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,688
What happened in your
life that brought you here

250
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:51,357
at such a young age?

251
00:17:53,108 --> 00:17:54,441
It's a secret.

252
00:18:12,315 --> 00:18:13,900
Any more questions?

253
00:18:21,065 --> 00:18:22,815
Ah, well well well.

254
00:18:24,315 --> 00:18:27,398
You are still hanging
in there, aren't ya?

255
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,400
Oh come on man, come on!

256
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,731
What do you got inside ya, huh?

257
00:18:32,733 --> 00:18:33,898
Are you gonna let
this little girl

258
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,648
take you out of the
game this early?

259
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,231
What about your kids?

260
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:38,688
You can't die now.

261
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:39,525
Jesus.

262
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:13,608
We must work together
as long as we can.

263
00:19:18,733 --> 00:19:23,148
There are things more
terrible than us in this game.

264
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:27,150
As individuals, we
don't stand a chance!

265
00:19:29,275 --> 00:19:31,813
There may still
be a way to escape

266
00:19:31,815 --> 00:19:33,482
if we work together.

267
00:19:34,565 --> 00:19:36,273
We must get to the safe zone.

268
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:37,940
We are being hunted.

269
00:19:43,525 --> 00:19:44,856
There are three of them.

270
00:19:44,858 --> 00:19:46,191
We must go, now!

271
00:20:18,358 --> 00:20:20,981
You're not
planning on using that, are you?

272
00:20:20,983 --> 00:20:22,231
No.

273
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:24,691
We wouldn't want an uprising.

274
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,023
It almost sounds like you do.

275
00:20:29,025 --> 00:20:30,731
His children, Savannah?

276
00:20:30,733 --> 00:20:33,023
You made me interview
Tucker's children?

277
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:34,273
Well he's trending high.

278
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:35,813
People want him to win.

279
00:20:35,815 --> 00:20:37,898
It's been a while since we had
one that might be innocent.

280
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,856
His children
believe that he is,

281
00:20:39,858 --> 00:20:40,856
and they're about to see him

282
00:20:40,858 --> 00:20:43,688
get ripped to shreds on live TV.

283
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:46,231
Nobody's forcing
you to be here.

284
00:20:46,233 --> 00:20:49,148
There are a number of
people behind you that would

285
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,813
love your job.

286
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:53,815
Younger, smarter, prettier.

287
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,398
They would put their
first born in the game

288
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,563
to get a shot at your position.

289
00:20:57,565 --> 00:20:58,400
I know.

290
00:20:59,275 --> 00:21:00,731
I want to be here.

291
00:21:00,733 --> 00:21:01,566
Good.

292
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:06,856
Oh.

293
00:21:06,858 --> 00:21:09,563
If you ever question
an assignment again,

294
00:21:09,565 --> 00:21:13,025
you can go ahead and
clean out your desk.

295
00:21:44,775 --> 00:21:47,023
Oh he should be easy.

296
00:21:47,025 --> 00:21:48,481
You want him?

297
00:21:48,483 --> 00:21:49,316
Wait.

298
00:21:52,608 --> 00:21:53,900
Don't be stupid.

299
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,233
Hi friend.

300
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:01,313
Do you happen to know which
way it is to the safe zone?

301
00:22:01,315 --> 00:22:04,563
We don't have much
time to find it.

302
00:22:04,565 --> 00:22:06,650
No, I have no idea.

303
00:22:07,983 --> 00:22:09,108
We're lost.

304
00:22:10,233 --> 00:22:13,563
We could die on the
first challenge.

305
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:15,606
Wrong answer, pal!

306
00:22:15,608 --> 00:22:16,650
Wait, stop!

307
00:22:19,315 --> 00:22:21,188
The raptors have
entered the canyon area.

308
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,188
What?

309
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,188
No, no no no.

310
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:25,023
How long until they get to them?

311
00:22:25,025 --> 00:22:26,483
Any second now.

312
00:22:27,483 --> 00:22:30,188
Do you know who I am?

313
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:34,275
I am El Avispa, The Wasp!

314
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,856
You know who I am?

315
00:22:41,858 --> 00:22:43,273
I'm The Wasp!

316
00:22:43,275 --> 00:22:44,856
I got a big stinger on my butt

317
00:22:44,858 --> 00:22:48,606
and when I sting
you I'm gonna die.

318
00:22:48,608 --> 00:22:49,688
I think that's a bee, man.

319
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:50,525
Shut up!

320
00:22:53,525 --> 00:22:55,398
I have very powerful friends.

321
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,063
Friends who can help us.

322
00:22:58,065 --> 00:22:59,188
Help me.

323
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:02,107
Help me get to the
end, help me win.

324
00:23:03,108 --> 00:23:05,563
Why would we do that?

325
00:23:05,565 --> 00:23:08,356
Because I can
save your mother.

326
00:23:08,358 --> 00:23:10,563
What do you know
about my mama, huh?

327
00:23:10,565 --> 00:23:12,773
I know all about you.

328
00:23:12,775 --> 00:23:13,608
Trust me.

329
00:23:14,608 --> 00:23:16,688
I can get us all out of here.

330
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:19,688
You will be able to
see your mother again.

331
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:20,900
Alive and well.

332
00:23:22,358 --> 00:23:23,438
You sack of shit!

333
00:23:26,025 --> 00:23:28,233
Wait wait wait wait wait!

334
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,733
Well?

335
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:41,233
What are you waiting for?

336
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,065
Wait wait wait.

337
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,775
Not yet.

338
00:23:48,233 --> 00:23:49,066
Come on!

339
00:24:00,608 --> 00:24:01,525
What the?

340
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,398
What is happening in here?

341
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,023
Our ratings have dipped 4%.

342
00:24:06,025 --> 00:24:07,563
Why did you stop the raptors?

343
00:24:07,565 --> 00:24:09,773
Listen, it's called
foreplay, Savannah.

344
00:24:09,775 --> 00:24:11,731
You might wanna try it sometime.

345
00:24:11,733 --> 00:24:16,275
Alright we're back
in five, four, three, two.

346
00:24:18,108 --> 00:24:20,438
That just happened.

347
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,481
Could this be an unholy alliance

348
00:24:22,483 --> 00:24:25,523
between the Mason
brothers and The Wasp?

349
00:24:26,733 --> 00:24:29,063
That would be a
match made in hell.

350
00:24:29,065 --> 00:24:31,313
And ladies and gentlemen,
I would hate to see

351
00:24:31,315 --> 00:24:35,148
what that means for
our other contestants.

352
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:38,231
Let's head back to the canyon.

353
00:24:39,483 --> 00:24:41,938
What just happened?

354
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,857
Let's go.

355
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:46,066
Wait!

356
00:24:47,315 --> 00:24:48,150
Join me.

357
00:24:49,315 --> 00:24:50,563
Help me get to the end.

358
00:24:50,565 --> 00:24:53,523
I can save your
mother, I promise.

359
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:54,358
Come on.

360
00:24:56,108 --> 00:24:59,813
You really think he's gonna
save anybody else but himself?

361
00:24:59,815 --> 00:25:02,148
How stupid could you be?

362
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:04,481
She's dying of cancer, no?

363
00:25:04,483 --> 00:25:06,983
No one dies of cancer anymore.

364
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:10,438
Poor people do,
you piece of shit!

365
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,273
I can pay for the treatment!

366
00:25:13,275 --> 00:25:14,858
Okay, okay, okay!

367
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,565
We'll help you.

368
00:25:19,858 --> 00:25:21,481
Have you lost your mind?

369
00:25:21,483 --> 00:25:24,063
Haven't you seen
this show before?

370
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:26,438
If he wins, we die, you idiot!

371
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,023
No he said he could
get us out too, huh?

372
00:25:30,025 --> 00:25:32,273
He knows people, right?

373
00:25:32,275 --> 00:25:33,108
Si.

374
00:25:34,525 --> 00:25:37,523
If there's even a chance
that we can save Mom.

375
00:25:37,525 --> 00:25:40,273
This is all bullshit!

376
00:25:40,275 --> 00:25:43,606
If he knows anyone outside,
then what's he doing

377
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:45,858
in here in the first place?

378
00:25:47,025 --> 00:25:49,148
I want you to use your
tiny little brain.

379
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:51,358
Think about that, ya moron.

380
00:25:52,483 --> 00:25:53,481
God damnit!

381
00:25:53,483 --> 00:25:54,900
God damnit, what?

382
00:25:56,733 --> 00:26:00,191
You touch him, and
I'll kill you myself.

383
00:26:03,315 --> 00:26:04,400
Okay, fine!

384
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,733
Fine!

385
00:26:09,608 --> 00:26:10,441
For now.

386
00:26:11,608 --> 00:26:12,525
We'll help.

387
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,688
None of them know.

388
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:35,023
Unfortunately, their mother,
Rosetta Mason, passed yesterday.

389
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,106
Such tragedy.

390
00:26:38,108 --> 00:26:42,483
But I promise that you are
gonna see the raptors soon

391
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,938
because stage two,
the maze, is up next

392
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:49,273
right here on the
Jurassic Games.

393
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:50,563
And we're clear.

394
00:26:50,565 --> 00:26:53,481
That was a good
transition, right?

395
00:26:53,483 --> 00:26:54,688
That was good.

396
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,398
Nice work.

397
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,731
I at first felt that the brothers
angle was a little forced

398
00:27:00,733 --> 00:27:03,231
but it was good drama.

399
00:27:03,233 --> 00:27:04,731
Well, alright.

400
00:27:04,733 --> 00:27:06,063
Hey, by the way, we gotta
make sure we keep them alive

401
00:27:06,065 --> 00:27:08,188
as long as possible.

402
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:11,773
Okay, can you imagine a
Cane and Abel type of ending

403
00:27:11,775 --> 00:27:13,148
for the finale?

404
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,563
I'm sorry to interrupt,
the contestants

405
00:27:14,565 --> 00:27:17,900
are approaching the
safe zone right now.

406
00:27:25,065 --> 00:27:26,063
We are close!

407
00:27:26,065 --> 00:27:26,982
Keep going!

408
00:27:49,565 --> 00:27:51,148
Objective complete.

409
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,815
Safe zone activated.

410
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:23,525
Go ahead.

411
00:28:24,983 --> 00:28:25,858
Taste some.

412
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,148
I don't think they'd let
you die of poison berry.

413
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:33,233
That's not very exciting.

414
00:28:38,233 --> 00:28:43,106
Seems like everything in here
tastes a little bit better.

415
00:28:43,108 --> 00:28:45,898
I don't know how they do it.

416
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,733
Do you?

417
00:28:49,275 --> 00:28:51,688
How would you taste?

418
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:53,313
Objective complete.

419
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:55,025
Safe zone activated.

420
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,106
Objective complete.

421
00:29:16,108 --> 00:29:17,775
Safe zone activated.

422
00:29:40,565 --> 00:29:42,773
What a surprise.

423
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:52,438
I'm Tucker, I'm innocent.

424
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,773
I'm Albert and
I'm gonna eat you.

425
00:29:54,775 --> 00:29:56,648
Jurassic
Games action figures.

426
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:59,106
Available wherever
fine toys are sold.

427
00:29:59,108 --> 00:30:00,188
Tucker.

428
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,148
Joy.

429
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,273
Dr. Franklin.

430
00:30:02,275 --> 00:30:03,231
Billy.

431
00:30:03,233 --> 00:30:04,398
Big Brother.

432
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,398
Little Brother.

433
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,398
Stephanie.

434
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,688
Ren.

435
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:10,438
Collect all 10
contestants today.

436
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,563
And if you collect
all 10 action figures

437
00:30:12,565 --> 00:30:14,313
of this year's contestants,
we will throw in

438
00:30:14,315 --> 00:30:17,231
the brand new version
of yours truly.

439
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:20,273
Complete with 10
new catchphrases.

440
00:30:20,275 --> 00:30:23,563
That's right, the
raptors are back this year.

441
00:30:23,565 --> 00:30:26,023
Get yours now
while supplies last.

442
00:30:26,025 --> 00:30:28,481
Every single network
is covering the games.

443
00:30:28,483 --> 00:30:30,188
This is even bigger
than last year.

444
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,731
Looks like a riot in Midtown.

445
00:30:31,733 --> 00:30:33,023
Eh, nothing new.

446
00:30:33,025 --> 00:30:34,523
They've been
protesting for years.

447
00:30:34,525 --> 00:30:35,648
Yeah.

448
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:36,856
We should put some of
those Cavemen in the games.

449
00:30:36,858 --> 00:30:38,106
Yeah no shit.

450
00:30:38,108 --> 00:30:39,273
Come on.

451
00:30:39,275 --> 00:30:40,813
We're starting the maze.

452
00:30:40,815 --> 00:30:44,523
No more games, no
more games, no more games!

453
00:30:55,983 --> 00:30:57,938
Only eight remain.

454
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,023
What a cast though, huh?

455
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:01,608
The Mason brothers.

456
00:31:02,815 --> 00:31:04,938
Would you take out
one of your own

457
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,400
if it really came down to it?

458
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:09,731
We'll see.

459
00:31:09,733 --> 00:31:10,650
We got Joy.

460
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,440
Ah, Joy, Joy, Joy.

461
00:31:14,608 --> 00:31:16,231
I'm telling you, there
is something special

462
00:31:16,233 --> 00:31:18,813
about sweet little Joy.

463
00:31:18,815 --> 00:31:21,356
Then we got Albert,
the cannibal.

464
00:31:21,358 --> 00:31:24,441
Albert, you make me sick.

465
00:31:25,233 --> 00:31:27,563
In a good way, of course,
because people tune in

466
00:31:27,565 --> 00:31:29,481
just to see you die.

467
00:31:31,483 --> 00:31:32,400
I like you.

468
00:31:33,565 --> 00:31:37,063
Keep you around for our
international viewers.

469
00:31:37,065 --> 00:31:40,563
And then we have
poor Anthony Tucker.

470
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:43,438
Doesn't really seem like
he's cut out for this,

471
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,313
but you know what, America
loves a tragic hero so I do too.

472
00:31:47,315 --> 00:31:49,606
Hang in there, buddy.

473
00:31:49,608 --> 00:31:50,441
Stephanie.

474
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:52,775
Oh Stephanie.

475
00:31:54,108 --> 00:31:57,813
I'd really hate for
someone or something

476
00:31:57,815 --> 00:32:00,481
to ruin that pretty face.

477
00:32:00,483 --> 00:32:02,773
Guess we'll have
to wait for that.

478
00:32:02,775 --> 00:32:04,775
And El Avispa, The Wasp.

479
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,188
I like you.

480
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,440
You're naughty.

481
00:32:10,065 --> 00:32:12,940
Alright, wake 'em
up, I wanna play.

482
00:32:30,483 --> 00:32:32,148
Welcome, contestants.

483
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,398
I hope you are ready for
your first challenge.

484
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,773
We like to call it the maze.

485
00:32:36,775 --> 00:32:38,063
A favorite segment of the games

486
00:32:38,065 --> 00:32:40,313
and our longest-running
challenge.

487
00:32:40,315 --> 00:32:41,856
The rules are simple.

488
00:32:41,858 --> 00:32:43,188
Be the first to
escape your chains

489
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:45,650
and you will be awarded this.

490
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:50,525
Right?

491
00:32:51,483 --> 00:32:52,981
Use it to protect yourself,

492
00:32:52,983 --> 00:32:54,981
use it to obliterate
your enemies.

493
00:32:54,983 --> 00:32:57,023
The choice is yours.

494
00:32:57,025 --> 00:32:58,938
I think in the right hands,
the hands of a fighter,

495
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,398
the hands of a winner,
this fine piece of hardware

496
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,313
could wind up ending
the game early.

497
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,856
Anything can happen
in the Jurassic Games.

498
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:08,106
That's what makes
it so much fun!

499
00:33:08,108 --> 00:33:09,313
So here we go!

500
00:33:09,315 --> 00:33:12,231
Ready in three two one go!

501
00:33:49,691 --> 00:33:51,146
I got it!

502
00:33:51,148 --> 00:33:52,481
You're all dead!

503
00:33:52,483 --> 00:33:53,771
I win!

504
00:33:53,773 --> 00:33:54,607
Game over!

505
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:56,983
Albert, Albert!

506
00:33:59,316 --> 00:34:02,731
You have no honor if you
use that now against us.

507
00:34:02,733 --> 00:34:05,983
Shut up!

508
00:34:07,441 --> 00:34:09,858
Anybody else, any last words?

509
00:34:16,108 --> 00:34:19,064
Please, please don't
shoot, I was kidding.

510
00:34:19,066 --> 00:34:21,271
- I won't kill anybody.
- Stay still!

511
00:34:21,273 --> 00:34:22,521
Please!

512
00:34:22,523 --> 00:34:23,481
Shoot him, what
are you waiting for?

513
00:34:23,483 --> 00:34:26,106
He's not gonna shoot him.

514
00:34:26,108 --> 00:34:28,606
He's the perfect
person for the gun.

515
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,774
The one that won't use it.

516
00:35:04,733 --> 00:35:05,733
Move away.

517
00:35:40,025 --> 00:35:40,858
Ren.

518
00:39:35,441 --> 00:39:36,275
Go, go!

519
00:39:42,691 --> 00:39:43,525
Go!

520
00:40:05,691 --> 00:40:07,398
- There's not an exit.
- What?

521
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,439
There's not a way out,
they're all dead ends.

522
00:40:09,441 --> 00:40:10,689
That way!

523
00:40:10,691 --> 00:40:11,689
Where's Ren?

524
00:40:11,691 --> 00:40:13,356
- Who?
- The grate.

525
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:14,316
Get back!

526
00:40:17,858 --> 00:40:19,025
Go, hurry, go!

527
00:40:38,691 --> 00:40:39,525
Go!

528
00:40:40,816 --> 00:40:42,273
Move!

529
00:40:42,275 --> 00:40:43,108
Move!

530
00:41:00,816 --> 00:41:01,731
Watch out!

531
00:41:07,025 --> 00:41:10,064
We're right back
where we started.

532
00:41:15,858 --> 00:41:18,064
Congratulations, contestants.

533
00:41:18,066 --> 00:41:19,356
Well done.

534
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:20,191
Stephanie.

535
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:23,648
Because you were the
first to exit the maze

536
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:26,898
I am gonna reward you with this.

537
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,731
And not far from here
you will find a crate

538
00:41:29,733 --> 00:41:33,064
containing a few potentially
game-changing supplies.

539
00:41:33,066 --> 00:41:35,189
This map will help
you get there safely.

540
00:41:35,191 --> 00:41:36,856
Stephanie, you may
choose to share it

541
00:41:36,858 --> 00:41:38,733
or keep it to yourself.

542
00:41:43,566 --> 00:41:46,358
The clock is
ticking, contestants.

543
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:49,356
Give it to me!

544
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:50,566
Hey back off!

545
00:41:51,733 --> 00:41:53,314
I want that.

546
00:41:58,025 --> 00:41:59,314
Hey, let her go!

547
00:41:59,316 --> 00:42:01,273
Get off me, boy.

548
00:42:05,191 --> 00:42:06,108
I got it.

549
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:08,108
Come on.

550
00:42:09,108 --> 00:42:09,941
I got it.

551
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,108
Let's go.

552
00:42:37,191 --> 00:42:38,356
Like that?

553
00:42:38,358 --> 00:42:39,941
How does that feel?

554
00:42:42,358 --> 00:42:44,273
First thought to
have been a hoax,

555
00:42:44,275 --> 00:42:46,648
Stephanie Rogers
brutally murdered 16 men

556
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:49,439
and broadcast her kills
live on the internet.

557
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:50,939
She spent the last three years

558
00:42:50,941 --> 00:42:52,606
at the Starkweather
Federal Penitentiary

559
00:42:52,608 --> 00:42:55,981
prior to her acceptance in
this year's Jurassic Games.

560
00:42:55,983 --> 00:42:59,314
She'll use her charms to
seduce the men in the game,

561
00:42:59,316 --> 00:43:02,481
just like a black widow
luring them into her trap,

562
00:43:02,483 --> 00:43:05,189
killing them in cold blood.

563
00:43:06,191 --> 00:43:07,358
Gimme a break.

564
00:43:09,816 --> 00:43:10,981
Come with me.

565
00:43:10,983 --> 00:43:14,191
I have to do some
fluff piece interview.

566
00:43:16,441 --> 00:43:18,648
I'm joined now
by Savannah Black.

567
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:20,689
She is the director of the
controversial sensation

568
00:43:20,691 --> 00:43:23,023
known around the globe
as the Jurassic Games.

569
00:43:23,025 --> 00:43:25,314
Savannah, thank you for
joining us this afternoon.

570
00:43:25,316 --> 00:43:26,898
Oh, my pleasure Jack,
thank you for having me.

571
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:27,898
Let's begin right off the bat

572
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,689
with the morality issue here.

573
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:31,481
Uh, excuse me?

574
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:32,856
Well you know
as well as anybody

575
00:43:32,858 --> 00:43:34,856
the show is
controversial, even still.

576
00:43:34,858 --> 00:43:36,523
Are we still discussing this?

577
00:43:36,525 --> 00:43:39,523
The contestants on our show
are going to die anyway.

578
00:43:39,525 --> 00:43:42,689
Now what we're doing, with
the support of the government,

579
00:43:42,691 --> 00:43:46,481
I might add, is giving
them a chance at freedom.

580
00:43:46,483 --> 00:43:47,939
But some say this is too much.

581
00:43:47,941 --> 00:43:49,606
Isn't this really nothing
more than exploitation

582
00:43:49,608 --> 00:43:53,523
of these contestants
for money, for ratings?

583
00:43:53,525 --> 00:43:57,148
And you are essentially torturing
them on live television.

584
00:43:57,150 --> 00:44:00,731
Well I'm not concerned
with a vocal minority.

585
00:44:00,733 --> 00:44:02,189
A lot more people
love the games.

586
00:44:02,191 --> 00:44:04,523
300 million the
last time I looked.

587
00:44:04,525 --> 00:44:06,148
It's what the people want.

588
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:07,606
You didn't answer my question.

589
00:44:07,608 --> 00:44:09,564
Well they are still
dying by lethal injection.

590
00:44:09,566 --> 00:44:11,314
- Yes, but...
- Listen.

591
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:13,106
We didn't invent this.

592
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,606
As much as I'd like
to take credit for it,

593
00:44:14,608 --> 00:44:16,898
public execution is nothing new.

594
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:19,314
Think back to the days
of the Roman Empire.

595
00:44:19,316 --> 00:44:20,939
The gladiators fought
tigers and there was

596
00:44:20,941 --> 00:44:23,856
a Coliseum filled with people
wanting the tiger to win

597
00:44:23,858 --> 00:44:26,148
and most often it did.

598
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:28,273
Now at least on our show
one of our contestants

599
00:44:28,275 --> 00:44:29,731
is guaranteed to live.

600
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:30,981
What about Anthony Tucker?

601
00:44:30,983 --> 00:44:32,564
There are a lot of folks
out there who believe

602
00:44:32,566 --> 00:44:34,564
he was wrongly convicted
of killing his wife.

603
00:44:34,566 --> 00:44:35,898
Well he was convicted
in a court of law

604
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,523
and sentenced to death.

605
00:44:37,525 --> 00:44:39,481
And that is the only
qualification required

606
00:44:39,483 --> 00:44:41,023
to enter the games.

607
00:44:41,025 --> 00:44:43,398
Oh, that and they
look good on camera.

608
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,314
But wouldn't you agree
having an innocent contestant

609
00:44:45,316 --> 00:44:47,148
killed on your show does
nothing more than fuel the fire

610
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:48,939
for groups like The Cavemen?

611
00:44:48,941 --> 00:44:50,273
I'm not familiar with them.

612
00:44:50,275 --> 00:44:51,481
You're trying to tell
me you've never heard

613
00:44:51,483 --> 00:44:52,981
of The Cavemen?

614
00:44:52,983 --> 00:44:56,439
I am aware of a very few
and extremely disorganized...

615
00:44:56,441 --> 00:44:59,106
Come on, it's well-known
they have promised

616
00:44:59,108 --> 00:45:01,606
to disrupt the ending
of this year's games.

617
00:45:01,608 --> 00:45:02,981
Surely you're aware.

618
00:45:02,983 --> 00:45:04,689
Well groups like
that have tried before.

619
00:45:04,691 --> 00:45:06,731
But our security is
tight, and I am confident

620
00:45:06,733 --> 00:45:09,314
that the games will go
on as they always do.

621
00:45:09,316 --> 00:45:10,898
Now we are approaching
our next challenge

622
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,106
and your audience
won't wanna miss that.

623
00:45:13,108 --> 00:45:16,023
Savannah Black, thank
you for joining us.

624
00:45:16,025 --> 00:45:17,898
Oh, thank you Jack.

625
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,733
Asshole!

626
00:45:19,858 --> 00:45:22,064
Volunteering for the games
is an admission of guilt!

627
00:45:22,066 --> 00:45:23,731
These aren't people,
they're murderers.

628
00:45:23,733 --> 00:45:26,023
God, I've had it up to
here with The Cavemen.

629
00:45:26,025 --> 00:45:27,398
People have a
right to protest.

630
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,814
Okay, protesting is one thing

631
00:45:28,816 --> 00:45:30,731
but threatening to
disrupt the show's ending,

632
00:45:30,733 --> 00:45:33,814
whatever the hell that's supposed
to mean, is unacceptable.

633
00:45:33,816 --> 00:45:35,648
You don't like the show?

634
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:37,314
Well neither do I,
and do you know why?

635
00:45:37,316 --> 00:45:38,773
Because there's a winner.

636
00:45:38,775 --> 00:45:41,148
One of these lunatics
gets to walk away free.

637
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:43,148
And it makes me sick.

638
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:45,066
If it were up to me they'd
all be dead already.

639
00:46:13,275 --> 00:46:15,025
That thing is huge.

640
00:46:31,608 --> 00:46:34,273
So why did you
enter the lottery?

641
00:46:34,275 --> 00:46:36,523
Same reason as everybody.

642
00:46:36,525 --> 00:46:37,358
Freedom.

643
00:46:40,108 --> 00:46:43,066
You really didn't
do it, did you?

644
00:46:44,108 --> 00:46:45,775
That's what I heard.

645
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:51,066
Doesn't matter
much now, does it?

646
00:46:56,983 --> 00:46:58,398
Why do you think
they picked dinosaurs

647
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,398
to be the things we're
running away from?

648
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,398
It tested better than robots.

649
00:47:05,025 --> 00:47:06,314
Look I dunno
man, gimme the map.

650
00:47:06,316 --> 00:47:07,731
You don't even know
how to operate it.

651
00:47:07,733 --> 00:47:09,648
I don't give a
damn, gimme the map!

652
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:10,856
Kiss my ass!

653
00:47:31,941 --> 00:47:32,775
Help me!

654
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,356
He's gonna die
anyway, leave his ass.

655
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:43,941
No, he's gonna finish,
he's gonna make it.

656
00:47:49,275 --> 00:47:50,941
This is it for me.

657
00:47:54,066 --> 00:47:58,483
I was never gonna help you
anyway, you piece of shit.

658
00:48:01,025 --> 00:48:05,983
Your mom's gonna
follow me to hell.

659
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:19,481
It's nothing.

660
00:48:19,483 --> 00:48:20,689
Calm down!

661
00:48:20,691 --> 00:48:21,523
I'm not playing
this game anymore.

662
00:48:21,525 --> 00:48:22,358
I'm done!

663
00:48:25,066 --> 00:48:26,066
You hear me?

664
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:27,983
I quit!

665
00:48:28,983 --> 00:48:31,523
- Put me back in my cell...
- Hey!

666
00:48:31,525 --> 00:48:32,358
I quit!

667
00:48:33,733 --> 00:48:35,689
I'm not playing
this game anymore!

668
00:48:35,691 --> 00:48:38,398
Hey!

669
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,733
It's you and me!

670
00:48:40,608 --> 00:48:41,814
It's you and me!

671
00:48:41,816 --> 00:48:44,606
We gotta stay together, focus!

672
00:48:44,608 --> 00:48:45,441
You focus.

673
00:48:46,525 --> 00:48:47,358
Focus.

674
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:59,023
Well you didn't see
that coming, did ya?

675
00:48:59,025 --> 00:49:01,689
Our contestants are
tired, they're hungry.

676
00:49:01,691 --> 00:49:04,023
The Wasp is gone, but I have
a feeling it's about to get

677
00:49:04,025 --> 00:49:07,689
a whole lot tougher
for our remaining six.

678
00:49:07,691 --> 00:49:09,858
And we're clear.

679
00:49:10,983 --> 00:49:12,439
How close are they
to the supplies?

680
00:49:12,441 --> 00:49:15,108
They're approaching right now.

681
00:49:16,025 --> 00:49:18,191
The buzzards are circling.

682
00:49:34,025 --> 00:49:36,773
Welcome, contestants, and
congratulations on your success

683
00:49:36,775 --> 00:49:38,273
and survival.

684
00:49:38,275 --> 00:49:41,439
We're down to the final six
but we seem to be missing one.

685
00:49:41,441 --> 00:49:43,441
Ah, there she is.

686
00:49:44,358 --> 00:49:46,691
The odds-on favorite to win.

687
00:49:47,733 --> 00:49:48,731
I'm gonna kill you.

688
00:49:49,941 --> 00:49:51,858
I sincerely doubt it.

689
00:49:53,066 --> 00:49:55,689
Beyond the red barrier
you will find two items

690
00:49:55,691 --> 00:49:58,356
that may be of some use to you.

691
00:49:58,358 --> 00:50:01,773
A knife, and, more importantly,
some more ammunition

692
00:50:01,775 --> 00:50:04,106
for your laser gun there.

693
00:50:04,108 --> 00:50:08,358
All you have to do is just
walk from here to there.

694
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:30,941
There are 17 mines...

695
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:36,273
Uh, well, maybe 20,
I can't remember.

696
00:50:36,275 --> 00:50:37,814
Between you and your reward.

697
00:50:37,816 --> 00:50:39,064
Don't worry.

698
00:50:39,066 --> 00:50:40,814
Stephanie's map will
guide you through.

699
00:50:40,816 --> 00:50:42,316
Use it to survive.

700
00:50:54,608 --> 00:50:56,606
Stop the game, I'm
not going through!

701
00:50:56,608 --> 00:50:57,731
Stop it!

702
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:01,983
Come on!

703
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,983
What are you doing?

704
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:09,064
Come on brother, come
on through, come on.

705
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:13,400
No, no, come on!

706
00:51:13,941 --> 00:51:15,275
Come on, no, no!

707
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,650
No, god damnit!

708
00:51:19,858 --> 00:51:20,691
No!

709
00:51:21,733 --> 00:51:22,566
Shit!

710
00:51:25,066 --> 00:51:25,900
No!

711
00:51:35,025 --> 00:51:36,525
My brother's dead!

712
00:52:06,233 --> 00:52:08,523
Back off, bitch.

713
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:11,066
Who's the odds-on favorite now?

714
00:52:20,733 --> 00:52:22,439
Well there goes Cain and Abel.

715
00:52:22,441 --> 00:52:23,564
I'm not gonna do another
interview like that,

716
00:52:23,566 --> 00:52:24,564
not during the games.

717
00:52:24,566 --> 00:52:25,731
That was an ambush.

718
00:52:25,733 --> 00:52:26,606
Hey, look at these
ratings though.

719
00:52:26,608 --> 00:52:28,106
Look at 'em.

720
00:52:28,108 --> 00:52:32,273
And nice work, by the way,
Brian, with the pterodactyl.

721
00:52:32,275 --> 00:52:37,231
I gotta say, I am really
happy with our final four.

722
00:52:37,233 --> 00:52:39,606
You know Jack mentioned a
direct threat from The Cavemen.

723
00:52:40,775 --> 00:52:41,814
He said they're
threatening to disrupt

724
00:52:41,816 --> 00:52:42,898
the ending of the show.

725
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,523
Oh, The Cavemen.

726
00:52:44,525 --> 00:52:46,314
What are they going to
do Savannah, huh?

727
00:52:46,316 --> 00:52:47,564
What are they gonna do?

728
00:52:47,566 --> 00:52:48,773
Every year they
say the same shit.

729
00:52:48,775 --> 00:52:51,023
Every year nothing
happens except for what?

730
00:52:51,025 --> 00:52:52,439
More controversy.

731
00:52:52,441 --> 00:52:55,939
Controversy leads to excitement,
more excitement leads to

732
00:52:55,941 --> 00:52:57,106
more viewers.

733
00:52:57,108 --> 00:52:59,398
Hell, I love The Cavemen.

734
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,773
Status report.

735
00:53:00,775 --> 00:53:01,606
Four remaining contestants
are relatively close

736
00:53:01,608 --> 00:53:03,314
to each other.

737
00:53:03,316 --> 00:53:04,939
Shut down most
of the main systems

738
00:53:04,941 --> 00:53:08,439
while I load the traps
and weather simulation.

739
00:53:09,441 --> 00:53:10,689
You what, hey, hey.

740
00:53:10,691 --> 00:53:13,731
Why don't you let 'em
breathe for a minute?

741
00:53:13,733 --> 00:53:14,606
Never know.

742
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:15,608
Maybe one of the
girls'll get naked.

743
00:53:35,316 --> 00:53:37,816
She's watching us, you know.

744
00:53:44,233 --> 00:53:46,564
Maybe you oughta
give me that clip.

745
00:53:46,566 --> 00:53:48,066
Come and get it.

746
00:53:50,025 --> 00:53:52,689
I'd go look for her but I
don't wanna leave you alone.

747
00:53:52,691 --> 00:53:53,525
With him.

748
00:53:54,733 --> 00:53:55,733
Smart man.

749
00:53:57,525 --> 00:54:01,566
You move one inch closer
to me and I'll gut you.

750
00:54:03,066 --> 00:54:03,900
Alright.

751
00:54:05,316 --> 00:54:06,150
Alright.

752
00:54:11,025 --> 00:54:12,025
It's fine.

753
00:54:56,900 --> 00:55:00,233
You're not much
older than my daughter.

754
00:55:03,816 --> 00:55:04,900
I was asleep.

755
00:55:07,608 --> 00:55:11,108
And I heard a noise
and I went downstairs.

756
00:55:15,775 --> 00:55:18,566
And the door had
been pried open.

757
00:55:22,233 --> 00:55:25,731
And I went to the kids'
rooms and I made sure

758
00:55:25,733 --> 00:55:28,650
they were okay,
they were sleeping.

759
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:34,566
And then I went back to my room.

760
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:40,566
And I found my wife
with her throat slit.

761
00:55:45,525 --> 00:55:49,941
She was covered in blood
and her eyes were wide open.

762
00:55:55,816 --> 00:55:59,566
The murder weapon was
a knife from my kitchen

763
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:03,731
and they said that I had
pried the door open myself

764
00:56:03,733 --> 00:56:06,816
to make it seem like
a home invasion.

765
00:56:10,566 --> 00:56:13,900
And I was convicted
and I was sentenced.

766
00:56:18,983 --> 00:56:20,483
You're just a kid.

767
00:56:25,941 --> 00:56:29,439
I'm gonna take
you to the final two

768
00:56:29,441 --> 00:56:31,358
and I'm gonna kill you.

769
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,233
Tucker!

770
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,398
I know you're close!

771
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,233
Tucker!

772
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,233
Tucker!

773
01:00:25,316 --> 01:00:26,814
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's come to my attention

774
01:00:26,816 --> 01:00:29,314
that one of our witnesses
would like to share something

775
01:00:29,316 --> 01:00:30,606
with us.

776
01:00:34,483 --> 01:00:39,439
He killed someone close
to you, didn't he?

777
01:00:39,441 --> 01:00:40,441
My husband.

778
01:00:43,108 --> 01:00:47,608
And now you feel like you
finally have some closure.

779
01:00:48,691 --> 01:00:51,358
Yes, yes I do.

780
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:55,483
Hey, hey, it's okay.

781
01:00:56,983 --> 01:00:59,898
That is a natural feeling.

782
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:01,733
And we all understand.

783
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:06,481
We're very close to finding out

784
01:01:06,483 --> 01:01:08,148
who will win this year's games.

785
01:01:08,150 --> 01:01:09,316
Don't go away.

786
01:01:10,941 --> 01:01:12,814
Holy shit, who is this?

787
01:01:13,983 --> 01:01:16,648
Whoa, the best
actress award goes to,

788
01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:17,648
what was your name, sweetie?

789
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:19,356
- Alison.
- Alison.

790
01:01:19,358 --> 01:01:20,439
Give it up for Alison.

791
01:01:20,441 --> 01:01:21,606
She almost had me crying.

792
01:01:23,025 --> 01:01:24,023
Can you believe that?

793
01:01:24,025 --> 01:01:25,273
We need more of her, seriously.

794
01:01:25,275 --> 01:01:26,814
Find out whoever her
acting class was.

795
01:01:26,816 --> 01:01:30,941
I'm gonna go get a drink,
I'm a little emotional.

796
01:04:00,566 --> 01:04:01,400
My kids.

797
01:04:03,566 --> 01:04:05,689
If you can hear me.

798
01:04:05,691 --> 01:04:07,398
I love you.

799
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:09,148
I'm coming home.

800
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:10,356
Dad!

801
01:04:10,358 --> 01:04:12,231
Do you hear that?

802
01:04:12,233 --> 01:04:13,566
I'm coming home!

803
01:04:59,733 --> 01:05:02,608
You're not
looking so good.

804
01:05:14,191 --> 01:05:16,939
You're the one
that's gonna kill me?

805
01:05:16,941 --> 01:05:20,189
Oh honey, you're already dead.

806
01:05:30,275 --> 01:05:31,439
We're getting immense
pressure from the press

807
01:05:31,441 --> 01:05:33,481
to comment on
Tucker's innocence.

808
01:05:34,775 --> 01:05:35,939
Okay, well here's my
comment to the press.

809
01:05:35,941 --> 01:05:38,398
He was sentenced to death.

810
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,814
Okay we have run the numbers

811
01:05:39,816 --> 01:05:42,398
and it could be a ratings
disaster if he dies in the game.

812
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,856
Are you out of your mind?

813
01:05:43,858 --> 01:05:44,856
What do you want?

814
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:46,106
You know what?

815
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:50,025
Come to me live as soon
as the tiger's finished.

816
01:05:56,941 --> 01:05:58,606
Only two remain.

817
01:05:58,608 --> 01:06:03,356
Joy, the heartless teenage
killer, ruthless and crazy.

818
01:06:03,358 --> 01:06:06,023
Who knows why, who cares?

819
01:06:06,025 --> 01:06:10,189
And Tucker, a family man who
callously murdered his wife

820
01:06:10,191 --> 01:06:12,191
in cold blood.

821
01:06:12,566 --> 01:06:15,316
Presumed innocent
by some of you.

822
01:06:17,025 --> 01:06:18,150
Listen to me.

823
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:20,983
I am not the judge.

824
01:06:22,108 --> 01:06:23,775
We are not the jury.

825
01:06:25,525 --> 01:06:26,650
But the game.

826
01:06:28,941 --> 01:06:31,275
The game is the executioner.

827
01:06:32,483 --> 01:06:36,150
And the game decides
who lives and who dies.

828
01:06:38,941 --> 01:06:40,814
Uh oh, we've got a problem.

829
01:06:40,816 --> 01:06:42,523
We just received an
encrypted message.

830
01:06:42,525 --> 01:06:43,773
From The Cavemen?

831
01:06:43,775 --> 01:06:46,398
No, from here,
inside the premises.

832
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:47,856
Open the final doorway.

833
01:06:47,858 --> 01:06:50,148
The last challenge begins now.

834
01:07:13,233 --> 01:07:14,316
I told you!

835
01:07:15,733 --> 01:07:19,650
I told you I'd bring you
to the final two with me!

836
01:07:35,441 --> 01:07:37,856
Excuse me, I need to
get to master control.

837
01:07:37,858 --> 01:07:38,775
Sit down.

838
01:07:42,566 --> 01:07:45,064
We've intercepted an encoded
transmission coming from

839
01:07:45,066 --> 01:07:46,900
- the premises.
- Really?

840
01:07:48,066 --> 01:07:49,064
What did it say?

841
01:07:49,066 --> 01:07:50,064
We don't know.

842
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:52,648
I was hoping you could tell me.

843
01:07:54,648 --> 01:07:58,564
We traced the transmission
back to your edit bay, Laura.

844
01:07:58,566 --> 01:08:01,733
Have you been sending
encoded messages?

845
01:08:03,523 --> 01:08:05,314
I'm going to kill The Host.

846
01:08:05,316 --> 01:08:06,273
On live TV.

847
01:08:07,607 --> 01:08:08,440
Tonight.

848
01:08:14,566 --> 01:08:18,064
No matter what you do,
the show will continue.

849
01:08:18,066 --> 01:08:20,314
It's bigger than me,
than you, than anyone!

850
01:08:20,316 --> 01:08:23,816
You'll never...

851
01:09:03,982 --> 01:09:05,980
Let's do this.

852
01:09:05,982 --> 01:09:07,480
Patience, Tucker.

853
01:09:07,482 --> 01:09:09,980
Joy, you are the favorite
to win this thing, you know.

854
01:09:09,982 --> 01:09:11,146
Eat shit!

855
01:09:11,148 --> 01:09:12,646
That's the spirit.

856
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:16,189
Tucker, I'm not sure anyone
expected you to get this far

857
01:09:16,191 --> 01:09:19,105
but there are millions of people
rooting for you out there.

858
01:09:19,107 --> 01:09:23,690
In fact, we have a very
special message from your kids.

859
01:09:24,982 --> 01:09:26,898
Survive, Dad, please.

860
01:09:28,523 --> 01:09:29,689
We know you're innocent.

861
01:09:29,691 --> 01:09:30,773
Get him out of the games.

862
01:09:30,775 --> 01:09:32,607
- Stop the games!
- Andy.

863
01:09:35,857 --> 01:09:37,275
Bring 'em back.

864
01:09:39,107 --> 01:09:41,814
Bring 'em back, bring 'em back!

865
01:09:41,816 --> 01:09:43,566
Bring 'em back to me!

866
01:09:44,566 --> 01:09:45,398
Ow!

867
01:09:52,857 --> 01:09:54,107
Why so upset?

868
01:09:55,525 --> 01:09:57,730
We are giving you a
chance to see them again.

869
01:09:57,732 --> 01:09:59,564
I mean really if it wasn't
for our little show here,

870
01:09:59,566 --> 01:10:01,400
you'd already be dead.

871
01:10:02,732 --> 01:10:05,565
And let the final
challenge begin.

872
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,898
Well, this is an easy game.

873
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:22,564
Now you will notice that
you are each chained

874
01:10:22,566 --> 01:10:24,314
to those locks.

875
01:10:24,316 --> 01:10:25,939
There are padlocks at
the end of your chains

876
01:10:25,941 --> 01:10:28,189
that need to be unlocked
for you to cross the outer

877
01:10:28,191 --> 01:10:29,191
finish line.

878
01:10:30,566 --> 01:10:34,064
Be the first to do so, and your
opponent will be eliminated.

879
01:10:34,066 --> 01:10:34,900
You win!

880
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:37,273
The keys.

881
01:10:37,275 --> 01:10:38,980
Excuse me?

882
01:10:38,982 --> 01:10:41,105
I don't think I
quite caught that.

883
01:10:41,107 --> 01:10:43,730
Where are the keys
to unlock the padlocks?

884
01:10:43,732 --> 01:10:44,855
There are two.

885
01:10:44,857 --> 01:10:46,773
One for each of you.

886
01:10:46,775 --> 01:10:48,480
Buried in the sand
somewhere between

887
01:10:48,482 --> 01:10:51,023
where you stand and the locks.

888
01:10:51,025 --> 01:10:54,107
Are you ready in
three, two, one, go!

889
01:11:07,941 --> 01:11:08,775
Tucker.

890
01:11:10,691 --> 01:11:14,773
Do you know why I threw
in my name for the games?

891
01:11:14,775 --> 01:11:17,148
I don't care about my freedom.

892
01:11:17,150 --> 01:11:20,189
Hell, being in here is as
close as I could ever hope

893
01:11:20,191 --> 01:11:21,358
to being free.

894
01:11:25,107 --> 01:11:27,773
A girl that does things that
I do won't last very long

895
01:11:27,775 --> 01:11:30,439
in the real world
anyway, you know?

896
01:11:32,816 --> 01:11:34,523
I wanted to meet you!

897
01:11:35,816 --> 01:11:38,855
Convicted killer that
the whole world loves.

898
01:11:38,857 --> 01:11:40,814
The man that wanted
to join the games

899
01:11:40,816 --> 01:11:44,564
so he could see his
precious kids again.

900
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:46,064
The man that everyone cried over

901
01:11:46,066 --> 01:11:47,898
when his sentence was given.

902
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:48,980
I mean what the hell?

903
01:11:48,982 --> 01:11:50,650
You talk too much.

904
01:11:54,107 --> 01:11:56,355
She cried for you.

905
01:11:56,357 --> 01:11:57,525
She missed you.

906
01:11:58,732 --> 01:12:00,355
She said that you were
gonna come save her

907
01:12:00,357 --> 01:12:02,689
and I really wish you
would have because I was

908
01:12:02,691 --> 01:12:04,605
so tired of waiting.

909
01:12:07,066 --> 01:12:09,900
I'm here to finish
what I started!

910
01:12:11,691 --> 01:12:15,773
I can't let the whole
world see you go free!

911
01:12:15,775 --> 01:12:20,939
I'm gonna cause one more
moment of chaos and heartbreak

912
01:12:20,941 --> 01:12:24,191
before I leave this
disgusting world!

913
01:12:28,066 --> 01:12:31,314
I killed your bitch of a
wife and I would do it again

914
01:12:31,316 --> 01:12:34,480
and again and again

915
01:12:34,482 --> 01:12:37,400
if I could!

916
01:12:38,357 --> 01:12:39,523
Yes.

917
01:12:39,525 --> 01:12:41,273
Yes, this is perfect,
this is perfect.

918
01:12:41,275 --> 01:12:43,148
This is awesome!

919
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:44,355
You knew?

920
01:12:44,357 --> 01:12:47,065
Well, I mean,
you know, we hoped.

921
01:12:51,066 --> 01:12:54,066
See you in hell,
you piece of shit!

922
01:12:56,941 --> 01:12:58,105
What did you say to me?

923
01:12:58,107 --> 01:13:00,357
I said I killed your wife.

924
01:13:01,816 --> 01:13:04,023
What did you say to me?

925
01:13:04,025 --> 01:13:05,355
Uh, give me a rex.

926
01:13:05,357 --> 01:13:06,564
Bring in a rex.

927
01:13:06,566 --> 01:13:09,064
I said I killed her, ah!

928
01:13:09,066 --> 01:13:10,648
I'm gonna kill you.

929
01:13:10,650 --> 01:13:11,939
Where, Savannah!

930
01:13:11,941 --> 01:13:13,108
We need a rex.

931
01:13:14,107 --> 01:13:15,355
Will you just, where is she?

932
01:13:15,357 --> 01:13:16,730
Do I have to do
everything myself?

933
01:13:16,732 --> 01:13:18,023
Just bring it out.

934
01:13:18,025 --> 01:13:19,023
Savannah!

935
01:14:11,816 --> 01:14:13,189
Come on.

936
01:14:13,191 --> 01:14:14,814
Oh God, get out of the way!

937
01:14:14,816 --> 01:14:17,316
Let's have some fun, shall we?

938
01:15:01,316 --> 01:15:03,064
What are they doing, why
aren't they attacking them?

939
01:15:03,066 --> 01:15:04,523
We programmed them
to behave the same way

940
01:15:04,525 --> 01:15:06,480
that they would in nature
and they're very territorial.

941
01:15:06,482 --> 01:15:07,689
We've never had
this many at once

942
01:15:07,691 --> 01:15:08,564
so I don't know what
they're gonna do.

943
01:15:08,566 --> 01:15:09,898
Well then fix it!

944
01:15:45,732 --> 01:15:48,565
Oh shit!

945
01:17:20,982 --> 01:17:21,815
Yes!

946
01:17:56,066 --> 01:17:57,939
- Pull him out now.
- What?

947
01:17:59,191 --> 01:18:02,230
Whoa, whoa, Laura,
what are you doing?

948
01:18:02,232 --> 01:18:03,898
Wake him up, slowly.

949
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:05,439
Brian, go to
commercial, right now.

950
01:18:05,441 --> 01:18:07,564
No Brian, bring it here, now.

951
01:18:07,566 --> 01:18:08,814
Laura, look at me, look at me.

952
01:18:08,816 --> 01:18:11,355
This has to be some kind
of a misunderstanding.

953
01:18:11,357 --> 01:18:13,773
The game is over for good.

954
01:18:13,775 --> 01:18:14,773
Okay.

955
01:18:14,775 --> 01:18:15,773
Where's Savannah?

956
01:18:15,775 --> 01:18:16,730
Savannah!

957
01:18:16,732 --> 01:18:17,939
This has gone on long enough!

958
01:18:17,941 --> 01:18:19,230
Tonight this is over.

959
01:18:19,232 --> 01:18:21,230
There will be no
more Jurassic Games.

960
01:18:21,232 --> 01:18:23,023
Okay, Laura, what are you,
stop, what are you doing?

961
01:18:23,025 --> 01:18:23,939
This is crazy.

962
01:18:23,941 --> 01:18:24,855
Jeff.

963
01:18:24,857 --> 01:18:25,773
Are you serious?

964
01:18:25,775 --> 01:18:26,814
I've known you 10 years.

965
01:18:26,816 --> 01:18:27,689
Are you kidding me?

966
01:18:27,691 --> 01:18:28,648
What is happening right
now, are you crazy?

967
01:18:28,650 --> 01:18:29,648
You're going in.

968
01:18:29,650 --> 01:18:30,480
What?

969
01:18:30,482 --> 01:18:31,314
No!

970
01:18:31,316 --> 01:18:32,148
Stop!

971
01:18:32,150 --> 01:18:32,980
Stop it right now!

972
01:18:32,982 --> 01:18:33,815
Stop it!

973
01:18:46,566 --> 01:18:47,605
Brian.

974
01:18:47,607 --> 01:18:49,900
If I don't call off that
T-Rex, it will kill him.

975
01:18:51,650 --> 01:18:52,730
You're not gonna shoot me.

976
01:18:56,275 --> 01:18:58,898
Bring it to me live, now.

977
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:00,023
It's over, everyone.

978
01:19:00,025 --> 01:19:01,564
It's over.

979
01:19:01,566 --> 01:19:04,855
Now watch this evil piece
of shit learn his lesson.

980
01:19:04,857 --> 01:19:05,855
Back to the desert.

981
01:19:05,857 --> 01:19:06,690
Do it!

982
01:19:19,150 --> 01:19:20,314
Okay.

983
01:19:20,316 --> 01:19:21,689
Alright.

984
01:19:21,691 --> 01:19:23,189
Come on baby, make it good.

985
01:19:23,191 --> 01:19:24,650
Let's fucking go!

986
01:21:37,482 --> 01:21:38,689
We all know by now

987
01:21:38,691 --> 01:21:40,230
the terrible events
that occurred

988
01:21:40,232 --> 01:21:42,939
during the finale of this past
season of the Jurassic Games.

989
