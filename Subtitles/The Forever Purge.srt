00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

00:02:26,606 --> 00:02:27,815
<i>Rápido.</i>

3
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:51,255
Hey!

4
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:22,286
Okay.

5
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:30,920
<i>- Gracias.</i>
- Hey.

6
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,778
<i>I pledge allegiance

<i>Illegal immigration on the rise.</i>

<i>A surge of migrants into the U.S.</i>

9
00:04:00,575 --> 00:04:02,702
<i>Cartels driving people
off their land.</i>

10
00:04:02,785 --> 00:04:06,122
<i>Mexicans flee cartel
violence, seeking the American dream.</i>

11
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:09,125
<i>One must ask,
is the dream still alive?</i>

12
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:12,020
<i>America is divided
by hate, economics, race, religion...</i>

13
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:14,839
<i>Racial tensions
are flaring up all over, one must...</i>

14
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:17,633
<i>White supremacy rising
as disinformation spreads.</i>

15

<i>The NFFA
voted back into power again.</i>

16
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:23,556
<i>The New Founding
Fathers immediately reinstate the Purge.</i>

17
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,850
<i>Is the Purge the answer?</i>

18
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:30,229
<i>The rich get richer,
and the poor are left behind.</i>

19
00:04:30,313 --> 00:04:33,900
<i>Is a biased media
stoking the flames of discord?</i>

20
00:04:33,983 --> 00:04:35,961
<i>This country
feels like it's at a boiling point.</i>

21
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:37,945
<i>The United States of hate.</i>

22
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:41,073
<i>Can the Purge
help this divided nation?</i>

23
00:04:41,157 --> 00:04:43,409
<i>These questions
will be answered soon,</i>

24
00:04:43,493 --> 00:04:47,079
<i>as the annual blood holiday
is once again right upon us.</i>

Whoa! There you go.

28
00:05:14,941 --> 00:05:16,317
You stay right there.

29
00:05:19,654 --> 00:05:21,864
Whoa, whoa. Hey, squirrelly, huh, sis?

30
00:05:21,948 --> 00:05:23,407
- Hyah!
- Yeah, just a little bit.

31
00:05:24,075 --> 00:05:25,076
Come on.

32
00:05:26,452 --> 00:05:28,496
Whoa! Hey, down.

33
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:29,956
Ho. Ho, ho, ho. Ho.

34
00:05:30,623 --> 00:05:33,251
Why does your brother
have to prove himself all the time?

35
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:36,087
Keep calm.
I gotcha, I gotcha, I gotcha.

36
00:05:37,088 --> 00:05:38,673
Whoa!

37
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:47,515
Little more horse than you expected, huh?

38
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:51,602
I know someone who can calm that beast.

39
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:34,937
Hey.

40
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:12,558
Shh, shh, shh.

41
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:16,896
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

42
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,689
Hey-hey-hey.

43
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,154
That's a cowboy.

44
00:07:41,921 --> 00:07:44,090
Let's get back to work. Come on.

45
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:45,174
Come on!

46
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,551
Come on.

47
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:51,013
Get back to work.

48
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:06,487
Hey.

49
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:16,496
Okay?

50
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:19,667
- Right?
- Right.

51
00:08:21,794 --> 00:08:23,963
- Darius.
- How's she doing?

52
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:27,258
You know, second week in the country.
The girl is terrified.

53
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,219
She's lucky she's got you
to walk her through this.

54
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:33,431
She is. And you're lucky
you have me to run this place.

55
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:34,974
I know I am.

56
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:37,893
<i>The Purge doesn't release anger.</i>

57
00:08:37,977 --> 00:08:40,438
<i>It increases anger.
It's a virus.</i>

58
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:43,024
<i>It's an American-born virus
of hate and rage,</i>

59
00:08:43,107 --> 00:08:45,234
<i>and it's injected with a bullet.</i>

60
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:48,404
<i>It's spreading.
It's growing. It's mutating.</i>

61
00:08:49,155 --> 00:08:51,949
<i>Open your eyes.
The Purge is coming.</i>

62
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:00,833
Mmm!

63
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:02,877
Mm-hmm.

64
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:10,009
This...

65
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:13,095
Reminds me of your mother's house.

66
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:23,105
Juan, please. Where are we?

67
00:09:23,189 --> 00:09:25,524
You need to practice your English.

68
00:09:25,608 --> 00:09:27,568
When in Rome.

69
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:29,070
When in America.

70
00:09:29,737 --> 00:09:31,697
Just do it for me.

71
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,574
Please.

72
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:37,328
The Tucker family
would really appreciate that.

73
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:38,621
Believe me.

74
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:42,601
Now that your wife is pregnant,

75
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:45,252
if you want any extra help,
you're welcome to come by.

76
00:09:45,336 --> 00:09:47,630
We can all lock down together.

77
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:49,715
I hate the damn Purge.

78
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:52,134
It's hard to be social on that night.

79
00:09:52,218 --> 00:09:53,636
But thank you for the invite.

80
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:54,720
Anytime.

81
00:09:54,804 --> 00:09:56,639
Baby, that smells so good.

82
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:59,225
I'm going to the kitchen.
Y'all need anything?

83
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:00,518
You want another beer?

84
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:02,520
Yeah, I'll take another beer. Thank you.

85
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:03,771
Thank you, honey.

86
00:10:06,774 --> 00:10:09,568
I don't know. I just feel like
a goddamn Hoover these days.

87
00:10:09,652 --> 00:10:13,114
Everything in my line of sight
just gets consumed.

88
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:15,908
Even things I hate, you know.

89
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:20,955
You know, Anna's been cooking for us
the most amazing Mexican food.

90
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:24,333
Am I right?
The food is so good, but so fattening.

91
00:10:27,086 --> 00:10:29,630
- I've put on five pounds.
- No, you have not.

92
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,968
You know, Anna has a sister.

93
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:36,595
Also a nanny. You should meet her.

94
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,097
Nah, we're all right.

95
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:40,057
What, baby?

96
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,770
We don't need
to meet her sister. We're fine.

97
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:46,564
Thank you, though.

98
00:10:47,148 --> 00:10:49,483
Baby, Emily's just trying to be nice
and help out, right?

99
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:51,235
So you're being a little bit rude.

100
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:56,031
Was I? Oh, my God.

101
00:10:56,115 --> 00:10:57,658
Well, my apologies, Emily.

102
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:59,785
Oh. It's fine.

103
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:02,163
It's just, it's really hard
to find good help,

104
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:04,832
and Anna's sister is a sweetheart.

105
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:07,042
We don't need to meet Anna's sister,
Emily.

106
00:11:08,878 --> 00:11:12,548
I don't even know if I want our kids
speaking Spanish in this house.

107
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:17,803
Now, thank you for the offer,
but no, thank you.

108
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:21,056
Okay, then.

109
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:29,607
<i>This is your learn English app.</i>

<i>Who would have thought

Hey, Juan.

120
00:12:30,668 --> 00:12:32,753
Kirk tells me that you were late
this morning.

121
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,546
I'm never late, sir.

122
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:37,341
You're never late?

123
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:41,345
Hey, Kirk, Juan here says you're lying.

124
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,931
Juan's a free man.
He can say whatever he wants.

125
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:48,435
Juan, you show up late again,
I'm gonna have to fire you.

126
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:49,519
That's the rules.

127
00:12:50,396 --> 00:12:51,438
Yes, sir.

128
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:55,734
Hey, you know what somebody else told me?

129
00:12:55,818 --> 00:12:58,880
That he found your lariat just laying
in the front of the stable, on the ground.

130
00:12:58,904 --> 00:12:59,905
Is that true?

131
00:13:00,698 --> 00:13:01,699
No, sir.

132
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:16,463
T.T., your Purge protection bonus.

133
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:18,590
- Thank you, Mr. Tucker.
- Stay safe.

134
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:21,176
- Thank you, sir.
- Kirk.

135
00:13:34,273 --> 00:13:36,608
You're doing a good job, Juan.

136
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:39,528
My son's a hair rattled
'cause of yesterday.

137
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:41,989
Don't take offense.

138
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:45,617
Thank you, sir. I really appreciate that.

139
00:13:49,455 --> 00:13:51,332
Can I be honest, Mr. Tucker?

140
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:54,626
Please do.

141
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:58,505
Your son doesn't like me because...

142
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,091
I'm Mexican.

143
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:05,220
And I think Dylan believes

144
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:10,309
that cowboys shouldn't be
from Mexico or Argentina,

145
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:12,811
or from somewhere else.

146
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:16,607
I know a lot of people feel that way, but
I'm not sure that's the case with Dylan.

147
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,276
He's a very proud man.
You one-upped him yesterday.

148
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,320
You're a damn fine cowboy, Juan.

149
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:24,531
I don't know, sir.

150
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:33,248
Well, I don't know either.

151
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:34,541
I'm just...

152
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:38,670
I always taught my son
to be a proud American.

153
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:41,173
But maybe I didn't really teach him
what that meant.

154
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:44,510
I don't even know
if I know what that means anymore.

155
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:46,095
"Proud American."

156
00:14:47,096 --> 00:14:48,972
The world's changing all around us.

157
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:50,808
At each other's throats.

158
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,646
Confusing times.

159
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,151
I want to give you...

160
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:07,282
the goddamn Purge protection bonus.

161
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:09,993

Thank you.

That money's nothing but a way
for these people to keep us alive

164
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:32,015
so they can continue using
our slave labor.

165
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:33,851
We're nothing more than that.

166
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,396
I know what I'ma use my money for, though.

167
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,481
And it's not for protection.

168

one hour away from the annual Purge.</i>

183

<i>and you squandered it by spreading
nothing but fear and hate.</i>

184
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:36,390
<i>See, my people have been watching
from the sidelines,</i>

185
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:39,059
<i>and we see that America's
reached a boiling point.</i>

186
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:42,020
<i>Hatred like that can't be contained.</i>

187

Almost there.

192

...much more expensive this year.

193

198
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:34,049

- Look at this.

204
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:27,102
- Good.
- Wait, what?

205
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:28,270
Dang.

206
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:31,356
Wait, how did you know how

No, that's not what I meant.

What did you mean then?

224

That America is everything.

America is <i>México.</i>

America is Africa.
America is <i>Italia.</i>

00:35:03,144 --> 00:35:05,271
But the Purge is over.

321
00:35:06,606 --> 00:35:08,190
Help! Please!

322
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:12,528
Boss!

323
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:18,326
Watch out!

324
00:35:20,202 --> 00:35:22,483
You're gonna fucking die.
You're all gonna die.

325
00:35:24,248 --> 00:35:25,875
Help! Boss!

326
00:35:28,586 --> 00:35:29,670
Be careful!

327
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:32,381
Boss?

328
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:35,009
Are you okay?

329
00:35:35,092 --> 00:35:36,510
Boss.

330
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:41,265
- You okay?
- Yes.

331
00:35:42,308 --> 00:35:45,269
- Come here. You all right?
- Yes.

332
00:35:50,358 --> 00:35:51,442
Fuck you.

333
00:35:52,693 --> 00:35:53,903
Fuck you!

334
00:36:00,868 --> 00:36:02,912
Go, Darius. Go!

335
00:36:08,668 --> 00:36:09,877
Drop your weapon!

336
00:36:10,961 --> 00:36:12,773
- On your knees.
- We didn't do anything.

337
00:36:12,797 --> 00:36:14,799
- Drop 'em. Get on your knees.
- Get on your knees!

338
00:36:14,882 --> 00:36:16,967
- They attacked us!
- We didn't do anything!

339
00:36:17,051 --> 00:36:19,131
The Purge is over, lady.
What the hell are you doing?

340
00:36:19,512 --> 00:36:22,306
Sir, this is a mistake. Wait, please.

341
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:24,892
- We didn't do anything wrong!
- Listen to me.

342
00:36:24,975 --> 00:36:26,519
Listen to us, sir!

343
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:31,649
It's so quiet.

344
00:36:32,942 --> 00:36:34,110
Where is everyone?

345
00:36:40,241 --> 00:36:41,450
Come on.

346
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:43,244
Stop the car.

347
00:36:55,423 --> 00:36:57,216
Well, well, well...

348
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:04,306
Look at this.

349
00:37:14,567 --> 00:37:16,652
This feels like fucking Christmas.

350
00:37:17,862 --> 00:37:19,739
Any of y'all get me a present?

351
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:22,366
Caleb, I know you did.

352
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:23,826
And let me tell you, sir...

353
00:37:24,785 --> 00:37:26,996
I spent your money well.

354
00:37:30,082 --> 00:37:31,876
Today's your day of reckoning, cowboy.

355
00:37:33,878 --> 00:37:36,589
You become me.

356
00:37:37,173 --> 00:37:39,633
And I become you.

357
00:37:40,217 --> 00:37:43,262
The old switcheroo is happening
on every ranch around here.

358
00:37:43,846 --> 00:37:46,015
You and all your rich-ass neighbors

359
00:37:46,098 --> 00:37:49,518
will find out what it's like
to be penniless and powerless.

360
00:37:49,602 --> 00:37:50,770
To be like us.

361
00:37:52,271 --> 00:37:55,649
These rich motherfuckers can't hide
behind their steel walls no more.

362
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,819
This is the way things are now, boys!

363
00:37:58,903 --> 00:38:00,529
This Purge is forever!

364
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:05,701
This is the real Purge. The eternal Purge.

365
00:38:05,785 --> 00:38:07,536
Ever after! Come on!

366
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,330
Ever after!

367
00:38:17,254 --> 00:38:20,758
I'm gonna give you a chance
to save your family, Dylan Tucker.

368
00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:24,178
One by one, but you'll have to pay.

369
00:38:24,762 --> 00:38:30,601
Let's start with eeny, meeny, miny, ho!

370
00:38:30,684 --> 00:38:32,269
How much would you give for her, Dylan?

371
00:38:32,353 --> 00:38:33,354
How much would you give

372
00:38:33,437 --> 00:38:36,524
to stop me from putting
a bullet in your baby sister's head?

373
00:38:37,066 --> 00:38:39,735
Let's say ten bucks, and she lives.

374
00:38:39,819 --> 00:38:43,989
That seems like a fair market price
for this broke-down, useless woman.

375
00:38:44,073 --> 00:38:45,616
Let's see how much money you got.

376
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:50,287
Aw, shit, Dylan. I forgot.
You're me now, which means you're broke.

377
00:38:51,747 --> 00:38:53,749
You have no money. That sucks, doesn't it?

378
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:58,462
See, Dylan, without money,

379
00:38:58,546 --> 00:39:00,256
you have no power.

380
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:03,843
Without money,
you can't save your own little sister,

381
00:39:03,926 --> 00:39:06,428
and she will die because of it.

382
00:39:07,137 --> 00:39:08,556
Now how's that feel?

383
00:39:10,933 --> 00:39:12,560
How's that feel, Dylan?

384
00:39:14,603 --> 00:39:16,564
Feels like shit, doesn't it?

385
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:19,483
That's my life.

386
00:39:19,567 --> 00:39:20,568
It's our life.

387
00:39:21,402 --> 00:39:22,486
That's how we feel.

388
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:26,991
That's how we have felt every day
since the day we were born!

389
00:39:27,074 --> 00:39:29,493
And I want you to fucking
feel that fucking pain

390
00:39:29,577 --> 00:39:31,096
- in your fucking stomach, Dylan.
- Hey!

391
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,831
Goddamn it. It looks like the old man's
got something to say. What?

392
00:39:33,914 --> 00:39:35,708
Damn it. You're right, Kirk. You're right.

393
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:37,471
I don't give a fuck
if you think I'm right.

394
00:39:37,543 --> 00:39:39,879
You're talking about life in America.

395
00:39:39,962 --> 00:39:42,923
The way the rich get rich
off the backs of the poor.

396
00:39:43,507 --> 00:39:48,762
The way it's been ever since we robbed
this land from the Native Americans.

397
00:39:50,139 --> 00:39:56,604
But you got no right to complain
about the very system you're supporting

398
00:39:56,687 --> 00:39:59,815
by picking up that gun
and sanctioning the goddamn Purge...

399
00:39:59,899 --> 00:40:01,442
We need more guns.

400
00:40:01,525 --> 00:40:03,319
...which is all about money.

401
00:40:05,946 --> 00:40:08,574
You know who created the Purge, don't ya?

402
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:14,455
A bunch of fat, rich businessmen
in Washington, D.C.

403
00:40:14,538 --> 00:40:17,166
So what would that make you, Kirk?

404
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,460
What would it make you?

405
00:40:20,169 --> 00:40:23,422
Huh? That would make you their lackey

406
00:40:23,505 --> 00:40:25,591
and a goddamn hypocrite.

407
00:40:26,258 --> 00:40:28,969
They expect you to go out there
and do their violence

408
00:40:29,053 --> 00:40:31,388
so they can play more golf.

409
00:40:31,472 --> 00:40:33,032
They've never even been in a fistfight.

410
00:40:36,602 --> 00:40:37,602
So...

411
00:40:38,938 --> 00:40:41,857
from my family to you,

412
00:40:41,941 --> 00:40:43,901
go fuck yourself.

413
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:55,788
Take cover!

414
00:40:59,083 --> 00:41:00,167
We need backup.

415
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,050
<i>Copy that. We're on our way.</i>

416
00:41:13,347 --> 00:41:15,724
Harper.

417
00:41:15,808 --> 00:41:17,893
What the fuck? What the fuck, Kirk?

418
00:41:17,977 --> 00:41:19,621
- The Purge is over, <i>cabrón.</i>
- Dad?

419
00:41:19,645 --> 00:41:21,313
Ever after.

420
00:41:25,067 --> 00:41:26,110
Fuck!

421
00:41:29,488 --> 00:41:30,572
The Purge is over, man.

422
00:41:34,743 --> 00:41:35,743
They're coming.

423
00:41:38,539 --> 00:41:39,915
Dylan!

424
00:41:39,999 --> 00:41:44,253
You need to get up here.
Let's go! You need to get your family!

425
00:41:44,336 --> 00:41:47,715
Harper! Come on!
Harper. Let's go.

426
00:41:47,798 --> 00:41:50,759
Come on. Let's go, let's go.
Come on!

427
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:56,515
Come on. Jump in.

428
00:42:05,399 --> 00:42:09,111
<i>10-13, we have three
more incidences reported.</i>

429
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:10,714
<i>Return to precinct.</i>

430
00:42:10,738 --> 00:42:12,114
Copy that.

431
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:14,658
This is insane.
People not hear the sirens?

432
00:42:15,451 --> 00:42:17,262
- A little busier than last year, huh?
- Yeah.

433
00:42:17,286 --> 00:42:20,456
I shouldn't even be here.
I did nothing wrong.

434
00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:22,708
...male in custody for transpo.

435
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:25,044
There's no such thing as crime anymore.

436
00:42:27,463 --> 00:42:29,256
Let me fucking go!

437
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:31,383
Would you shut the fuck up?

438
00:42:31,467 --> 00:42:34,428
Make me.

439
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:36,055
What's going on, Darius?

440
00:42:36,138 --> 00:42:37,514
I don't know.

441
00:42:42,061 --> 00:42:43,437
Adela...

442
00:42:49,526 --> 00:42:51,379
Let me check the radio.
Maybe there's some news.

443
00:42:51,403 --> 00:42:54,031
<i>People are still purging
all across the country.</i>

444
00:42:54,114 --> 00:42:57,367
<i>"Ever After Purge"
is popping up all over social media.</i>

445
00:42:57,451 --> 00:42:58,827
<i>Continuous purging dubbed...</i>

446
00:42:58,911 --> 00:43:00,245
Where the hell are we gonna go?

447
00:43:00,329 --> 00:43:02,372
We'll find somewhere safe.

448
00:43:02,456 --> 00:43:05,459
First, we help Juan find his wife.
Then we find somewhere safe.

449
00:43:05,542 --> 00:43:07,461
<i>Stay inside your homes.</i>

450
00:43:17,012 --> 00:43:18,347
<i>...take action to stop it.</i>

451
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:19,973
<i>Still, no one knows...</i>

452
00:43:20,057 --> 00:43:21,517
I know where she is.

453
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:28,190
Ever after.

454
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:29,399
Ever after.

455
00:43:30,692 --> 00:43:35,864
This is the first real Purge.

456
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,953
It's never gonna stop.

457
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:45,207
Let me fucking go!

458
00:44:07,521 --> 00:44:08,730
Shit.

459
00:44:09,773 --> 00:44:10,941
It's blocked.

460
00:44:15,654 --> 00:44:16,655
Hold on.

461
00:44:17,197 --> 00:44:19,449
The station is just a few blocks away.

462
00:44:20,117 --> 00:44:21,785
I hope she'll be there.

463
00:44:22,953 --> 00:44:24,496
We can walk from here.

464
00:44:34,298 --> 00:44:36,658
You go get your wife.
We'll stay here and protect the truck.

465
00:44:37,301 --> 00:44:39,219
But you move fast. It's not safe here.

466
00:44:39,303 --> 00:44:40,554
You don't need to wait for us.

467
00:44:40,637 --> 00:44:41,763
Yes, we do.

468
00:44:43,765 --> 00:44:45,392
I'm coming with you.

469
00:44:46,727 --> 00:44:48,395
You don't have to do that.

470
00:44:48,478 --> 00:44:51,773
No, you don't have to do that.

471
00:44:52,649 --> 00:44:53,692
Yeah, I do.

472
00:44:55,235 --> 00:44:56,695
They saved our lives.

473
00:44:58,363 --> 00:45:00,782
We'll be right here. Now go.

474
00:45:00,866 --> 00:45:01,992
Come on.

475
00:45:14,546 --> 00:45:15,964
I'll take the back.

476
00:45:16,048 --> 00:45:17,382
Good. Come on, guys.

477
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:19,384
This side.

478
00:45:35,776 --> 00:45:39,196
That is a.30-06.

479
00:45:41,657 --> 00:45:44,159
.30-30.

480
00:45:44,243 --> 00:45:46,370
Yeah, yeah.

481
00:45:46,453 --> 00:45:49,790
AR-15!

482
00:45:49,873 --> 00:45:52,459
Listen to that rhythm.

483
00:45:52,542 --> 00:45:54,419
That is a Glock.

484
00:45:54,503 --> 00:45:56,797
Boom! Boom!

485
00:45:58,131 --> 00:46:00,592
Listen to that bass!

486
00:46:00,676 --> 00:46:03,178
Double-barrel shotgun.

487
00:46:03,762 --> 00:46:05,764
AK-47.

488
00:46:05,847 --> 00:46:08,850
Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat, tat-tat-tat.

489
00:46:10,602 --> 00:46:14,064
Homegrown music
from the heartland right there.

490
00:46:17,109 --> 00:46:19,945
That is American music, motherfucker.

491
00:46:20,028 --> 00:46:22,990
Tat-tat-tat-tat.

492
00:46:26,827 --> 00:46:29,705
Strike up the band!

493
00:46:29,788 --> 00:46:32,249
The symphony sings!

494
00:46:32,332 --> 00:46:34,126
Hold on! We're under attack.

495
00:46:36,336 --> 00:46:38,380
Dispatch, we're outside the precinct!

496
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:40,215
- Request backup.
- Boom! Boom! Boom!

497
00:47:13,707 --> 00:47:14,791
What?

498
00:47:14,875 --> 00:47:15,959
Okay.

499
00:47:17,002 --> 00:47:18,003
Honey...

500
00:47:19,046 --> 00:47:20,672
I need you to take this.

501
00:47:20,756 --> 00:47:22,316
Don't ask any questions, not right now.

502
00:47:22,382 --> 00:47:24,527
I'm gonna get out of the car.
I need you to lock the door.

503
00:47:24,551 --> 00:47:26,303
- Okay.
- I'll be right back.

504
00:48:23,527 --> 00:48:24,569
Open up, bitch!

505
00:49:03,817 --> 00:49:04,860
Baby!

506
00:49:05,861 --> 00:49:06,945
No!

507
00:49:26,548 --> 00:49:27,799
Yeah!

508
00:49:27,883 --> 00:49:28,884
Cover me!

509
00:49:28,967 --> 00:49:30,218
Go, go, go!

510
00:49:30,886 --> 00:49:32,053
Forever Purge!

511
00:49:37,142 --> 00:49:38,852
You're fucking dead, <i>puta.</i>

512
00:49:44,983 --> 00:49:46,151
Get off me!

513
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:50,155
You're a pig!

514
00:49:50,238 --> 00:49:52,657
Get the fuck off of me!

515
00:49:53,492 --> 00:49:54,701
Stop fighting it.

516
00:49:55,827 --> 00:49:57,913
Get the fuck off of me.

517
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:04,419
Come on. Come here.

518
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,888
Motherfucker!

519
00:50:14,971 --> 00:50:16,181
Help me!

520
00:50:16,723 --> 00:50:18,141
Fucking pig!

521
00:50:20,435 --> 00:50:21,436
Kill him!

522
00:50:34,115 --> 00:50:35,617
Think there's some inside.

523
00:50:37,827 --> 00:50:39,829
Pry those doors open!

524
00:50:39,913 --> 00:50:41,623
Let's see what's inside!

525
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:43,500
Forever Purge!

526
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,478
- Open it up!
- Get out of the way!

527
00:50:45,502 --> 00:50:46,836
Ever after!

528
00:50:52,592 --> 00:50:54,032
What was that?

529
00:50:58,390 --> 00:50:59,516
- Juan?
- Adela.

530
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:00,559
Juan!

531
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,894
Juan! Juan.

532
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:10,026
Purge forever!

533
00:51:17,492 --> 00:51:18,493
Over here!

534
00:51:24,791 --> 00:51:25,792
Hold on.

535
00:51:27,168 --> 00:51:29,879
The truck is coming! It's Dylan!

536
00:51:29,963 --> 00:51:31,590
Get in the truck!

537
00:51:32,424 --> 00:51:33,758
Get in!

538
00:51:33,842 --> 00:51:35,528
- The truck! Come in!
- Come on, boss.

539
00:51:35,552 --> 00:51:38,430
No, find safety now.
I need to get to my family.

540
00:51:39,598 --> 00:51:42,142
- We'll help you.
- I'll move faster on my own. I'll be fine.

541
00:51:42,225 --> 00:51:44,019
- Just go!
- Come on!

542
00:51:46,187 --> 00:51:47,731
Here. You saved my life.

543
00:51:47,814 --> 00:51:48,940
- Thank you, Darius.
- Okay.

544
00:51:49,024 --> 00:51:51,443
Adela!

545
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,240
Okay, let's grab everything we can.

546
00:53:01,805 --> 00:53:02,805
Peanut butter?

547
00:53:07,977 --> 00:53:09,562
You found the jelly.

548
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:12,482
This could work.

549
00:53:36,965 --> 00:53:39,610
<i>As the violence
escalates across the country,</i>

550

more information.</i>

551
00:53:42,345 --> 00:53:44,865
<i>That's right, Ruth.
And we are still trying to figure out</i>

552
00:53:44,889 --> 00:53:48,560
<i>if this Forever Purge
was coordinated or spontaneous.</i>

553
00:53:48,643 --> 00:53:51,938
<i>Various hashtags, "Too much hate,"
"One day not enough"</i>

<i>...the ashes of a dead country.</i>

563
00:54:15,879 --> 00:54:17,297

<i>We've just gotten word that the NFFA has

<i>¿Bueno?</i>

571
00:54:44,199 --> 00:54:47,243
Juan, I can't understand
what you're saying.

572
00:54:47,869 --> 00:54:49,829
Come on.
The cell things. The...

573
00:54:51,748 --> 00:54:53,249
- Towers?
- Yeah, the towers!

574
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:55,543
The cell towers.
They are cutting them.

575
00:54:55,627 --> 00:54:59,297
Hey. We just watched
that a lot of cities have gone dark.

576
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:01,591
Miami is gone.
Austin is under siege.

577
00:55:01,674 --> 00:55:04,969
First responders are overwhelmed.
We're in a state of emergency.

578
00:55:05,053 --> 00:55:06,095
It's all over the country.

579
00:55:06,179 --> 00:55:08,306
The violence is spreading
and not stopping.

580
00:55:08,389 --> 00:55:10,725
So there's nowhere safe to go.

581
00:55:11,476 --> 00:55:13,186
There's no way to get help.

582
00:55:17,398 --> 00:55:19,275
There's that symbol again.

583
00:55:20,318 --> 00:55:21,736
This was planned.

584
00:55:26,115 --> 00:55:28,201
- I got a map.
- I got ammo.

585
00:55:30,161 --> 00:55:31,412
- What?
- Turn it up!

586
00:55:31,496 --> 00:55:33,289
Give it to me.

587
00:55:38,336 --> 00:55:40,505
All right. Well, we need to make a move.

588
00:55:40,588 --> 00:55:42,674
They're gonna be coming here for gas.

589
00:55:45,218 --> 00:55:47,178
Hey! We got news, guys.

590
00:55:47,262 --> 00:55:48,263
What is it?

591
00:55:48,346 --> 00:55:50,746
<i>I repeat, your safety
cannot be guaranteed.</i>

592

<i>Both countries will then close down

We don't have a choice.

<i>Authorities are urging everyone to get

You don't like me, do you, Dylan?

613
00:57:38,373 --> 00:57:39,999
You don't like Mexicans.

614
00:57:41,751 --> 00:57:43,670
What are you talking about, Juan?

615
00:57:44,379 --> 00:57:45,630
Come on. Be honest.

616
00:57:47,048 --> 00:57:49,968
Let's... how do you say this?

617
00:57:51,469 --> 00:57:52,929
Slice the shit?

618
00:57:53,012 --> 00:57:55,223
- Cut the shit?
- Cut the shit. Yeah.

619
00:57:55,306 --> 00:57:57,868
- You wanna cut the shit?
- I wanna cut the shit with you.

620
00:57:57,892 --> 00:57:59,936
All right, I'll cut the shit
with you, Juan.

621
00:58:00,645 --> 00:58:02,522
I got no problem with Mexicans.

622
00:58:03,398 --> 00:58:05,198
But I will say
I don't understand your culture

623
00:58:05,274 --> 00:58:07,235
just like you don't understand mine.

624
00:58:09,028 --> 00:58:11,155
God's honest truth,

625
00:58:11,239 --> 00:58:14,659
I don't think white people
are any better or worse than anybody else.

626
00:58:14,742 --> 00:58:16,494
But this I do believe:

627
00:58:18,579 --> 00:58:20,623
We should all just stick with our own.

628
00:58:21,624 --> 00:58:23,710
Just leave each other alone.

629
00:58:25,753 --> 00:58:27,088
You might be right.

630
00:58:28,464 --> 00:58:30,174
But we are together now.

631
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:40,768

00:58:42,437 --> 00:58:43,956
Okay, everybody, wake up.

Wake up! Be alert!

Oh, shit.

635
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:53,406
Jesus Christ. "Ever After"?

636
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:05,752
Holy shit.

637
00:59:13,634 --> 00:59:15,154
Okay. They're coming up on us.

Holy shit! They're shooting at us!

639

Shit. They're slowing us down.

640
00:59:30,777 --> 00:59:32,504
- Pull over!
- How many are there?

641
00:59:33,654 --> 00:59:35,299
- There are two on this side.
- Stay down.

642
00:59:35,323 --> 00:59:36,407
Just keep driving.

643
00:59:38,701 --> 00:59:40,870
Stop this truck! Now!

644
00:59:42,497 --> 00:59:45,416
- Stay down. Everyone stay down.
- Stop this truck!

645
00:59:46,375 --> 00:59:48,854
- I'm just gonna run him over!
- No, baby. No, baby, wait.

646
00:59:48,878 --> 00:59:50,606
- Wait! I got an idea.
- What?

647
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:52,316
Don't do it.
There's too many of them.

648
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:54,092
Juan,
get away from the window.

649
00:59:55,301 --> 00:59:56,661
Stay away from the window.

650
00:59:56,719 --> 00:59:59,931
- Ever After, motherfuckers!
- Pull that fucking truck over!

651
01:00:03,226 --> 01:00:05,645
Ever After!

652
01:00:08,147 --> 01:00:11,400
She's one of us!
Purge Ever After!

653
01:00:15,363 --> 01:00:17,198
They're going away.

654
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:25,957
Way to go, Harper.

655
01:00:49,605 --> 01:00:52,285
<i>The border will close in three hours.</i>

656

Oh, my God.

663
01:01:34,901 --> 01:01:36,319
Holy shit.

664
01:01:36,903 --> 01:01:38,755
The crossing point is only one mile away.

665
01:01:38,779 --> 01:01:40,507
There's no way through.

666
01:01:40,531 --> 01:01:41,771
It's blocked. What should I do?

667
01:01:43,868 --> 01:01:45,554
How are we supposed to get through?

668
01:01:45,578 --> 01:01:46,913
We'll find a way, Cassidy.

669
01:01:52,001 --> 01:01:54,795
Just keep driving.
We got less than three hours.

670
01:01:56,797 --> 01:01:59,800
Please don't break down.
Come on, baby. We're nearly there.

671
01:01:59,884 --> 01:02:01,719
Baby, be careful.

672
01:02:06,307 --> 01:02:07,808
- It's blocked!
- What?

673
01:02:07,892 --> 01:02:09,932
She's broke down.
Come on, we gotta get out.

674
01:02:09,977 --> 01:02:12,104
Border's just a few blocks from here.
We can make it.

675
01:02:12,188 --> 01:02:13,356
Everybody follow Juan.

676
01:02:13,439 --> 01:02:14,982
Get ready. Stay low! Stay together!

677
01:02:15,066 --> 01:02:17,610
I cover you in three, two, one.

678
01:02:17,693 --> 01:02:19,487

Stay close, guys.

682
01:02:29,038 --> 01:02:30,623
Dylan, cover the back!

683
01:02:31,832 --> 01:02:32,959
Stay close!

684
01:02:40,841 --> 01:02:44,262
T.T., cover the right.

685
01:02:47,598 --> 01:02:50,601
Juan! Go, go!

686
01:02:53,437 --> 01:02:54,480
Move, move!

687
01:02:55,481 --> 01:02:56,482
I'm behind you.

688
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:00,069
Stay close.

689
01:03:01,737 --> 01:03:03,406
Revolution!

690
01:03:09,245 --> 01:03:11,080
Get to the wall. Get to the wall!

691
01:03:11,163 --> 01:03:12,999
- Come on.
- There's the wall, guys!

692
01:03:22,466 --> 01:03:24,569
- Dylan, get back!
- They have a.50 caliber.

693
01:03:24,593 --> 01:03:26,137
Stay with me.

694
01:03:27,263 --> 01:03:28,347
Oh, shit!

695
01:03:28,889 --> 01:03:30,075
Let's use it as cover.

696
01:03:30,099 --> 01:03:32,452
- <i>Surrender your weapons.</i>
- You guys go to the wall!

697
01:03:32,476 --> 01:03:34,562
Get cover! Get cover! Move, move!

698

Guys, go ahead! Go ahead!

700
01:03:45,448 --> 01:03:47,033
Come on. We're gonna go across.

701
01:03:52,663 --> 01:03:55,666
Come on, guys. Let's go! Let's go!

702
01:03:58,753 --> 01:04:00,671
Get your head down when you come in!

703
01:04:02,006 --> 01:04:03,215
We can go. Stay back.

704
01:04:03,299 --> 01:04:05,801
- Keep your head down. Keep your body down!
- Yeah. Yeah.

705
01:04:05,885 --> 01:04:06,886
Go!

706
01:04:06,969 --> 01:04:09,013
We need to keep up. Follow me, okay?

707
01:04:10,348 --> 01:04:13,225
Stay down! Stay down.

708
01:04:15,978 --> 01:04:18,981
What is that?

709
01:04:19,065 --> 01:04:20,191
It's a tank.

710
01:04:20,274 --> 01:04:22,193
We're gonna go across to the theater!

711
01:04:23,110 --> 01:04:24,710
- Across to the theater.
- Okay.

712
01:04:24,737 --> 01:04:26,655
When the truck passes, let's make a run.

713
01:04:29,909 --> 01:04:31,702
We have to cross right now!

714
01:04:31,786 --> 01:04:34,121
There's a fucking tank down there.

715
01:04:34,622 --> 01:04:36,082
Come on! Come on!

716
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:39,668
Oh, my gosh!

717
01:04:43,172 --> 01:04:44,632

- Juan! Juan?

723
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:21,180
- It's blocked.
- Are you guys okay?

724
01:05:21,252 --> 01:05:24,505
Adela, we'll go around!
Find another way out!

725
01:05:25,423 --> 01:05:28,259
- Baby? Baby, open the door.
- I can't get it open!

726
01:05:28,342 --> 01:05:29,969

How come you know how to fight like that?

773
01:08:34,028 --> 01:08:36,155
I was part of the <i>autodefensas.</i>

774

What?

775
01:08:37,781 --> 01:08:40,492
A group of women fighting the cartels.

776
01:08:40,576 --> 01:08:42,119
We did damage to them.

777

They forced me and Juan off of our land.

778

783

You too, <i>amigo</i>.
Come on now.

790

You're surrounded.
You will be shot.

791
01:09:28,832 --> 01:09:30,000
That a boy.

792
01:09:32,044 --> 01:09:33,712
It's all right, pretty thing.

793
01:09:33,796 --> 01:09:36,340
Come on now. Do it.

794
01:09:37,591 --> 01:09:39,031
Nice and easy.
Good.

795
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:41,553
You fucking deaf, son?

796
01:09:43,639 --> 01:09:45,224
Good boy.

797
01:09:47,476 --> 01:09:48,996
Look what we got here.

798
01:09:49,687 --> 01:09:51,397
A couple of bad <i>hombres.</i>

799
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:54,441
Well, I'll be.
There's two of us and two of them.

800
01:09:54,525 --> 01:09:56,378
That right there
is what's wrong with this country.

801
01:09:56,402 --> 01:09:58,153
What do you want to do about 'em, Daddy?

802
01:09:58,237 --> 01:10:00,072
Why don't we give
our fellow Americans here

803
01:10:00,155 --> 01:10:02,491
an opportunity to redeem themselves?

804
01:10:02,574 --> 01:10:04,535
Yeah, I like the sound of that.

805
01:10:04,618 --> 01:10:08,080
Let me explain. You kill the brownies,

806
01:10:09,289 --> 01:10:11,250
and the two of you can live

807
01:10:11,959 --> 01:10:16,213
and stay here
in this great God-loving country.

808
01:10:16,964 --> 01:10:19,466
Help us purify this nation
once and for all.

809
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:22,010
That's what the Ever After Purge
is all about.

810
01:10:23,887 --> 01:10:25,973
Fuck you, redneck.

811
01:10:27,433 --> 01:10:28,976
Yeah, fuck you, pig.

812
01:10:29,059 --> 01:10:30,686
No, fuck you, bitch!

813
01:10:30,769 --> 01:10:33,981
This country's gone haywire.
It don't know itself no more.

814
01:10:34,064 --> 01:10:36,543
- You don't fucking know yourself.
- Mother, Mother, it's okay.

815
01:10:36,567 --> 01:10:39,611
- Look in the fucking mirror!
- Mother! Hey, it's okay.

816
01:10:41,447 --> 01:10:43,031
Maybe this will help y'all.

817
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:48,287
You happy now?

818
01:10:48,871 --> 01:10:49,955
Mother.

819
01:10:51,707 --> 01:10:52,916
Gladly.

820
01:11:10,851 --> 01:11:12,603
Let the purification begin!

821
01:11:13,687 --> 01:11:17,483
Fucking dying?
Oh, you fucking little beaner.

822
01:11:17,566 --> 01:11:19,735
You fucking ain't worth shit.

823
01:11:19,818 --> 01:11:21,820
Get the fuck back.

824
01:11:24,865 --> 01:11:26,408
Don't even think about it, brownie.

825
01:11:28,368 --> 01:11:30,388
<i>This is the NFFA.
Lay down your weapons</i>

826
01:11:30,412 --> 01:11:32,790
<i>- or you will be shot.</i>
- Shoot the pigs!

827
01:11:36,418 --> 01:11:37,586
Call for backup!

828
01:11:38,378 --> 01:11:39,588
Shit!

829
01:11:40,214 --> 01:11:43,217
Backup! Backup!
We need backup, goddamn it!

830
01:11:44,802 --> 01:11:46,386
Backup's coming, baby.

831
01:11:51,183 --> 01:11:52,183
Fuck!

832
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:06,406
Mother, no! No!

833
01:12:06,490 --> 01:12:08,116
- Mother!
- Harper! Let's go!

834
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:09,910
Mother!

835
01:12:17,167 --> 01:12:18,961
- Take cover!
- RPG!

836
01:12:24,091 --> 01:12:25,425
Mother!

837
01:12:27,302 --> 01:12:28,846
Oh, no. Mother.

838
01:12:42,985 --> 01:12:46,655
This is Alpha Leader.
Request recon, all units.

839
01:12:49,992 --> 01:12:51,201
It's here.

840
01:12:52,703 --> 01:12:55,038
If our men are alive, they will be here.

841
01:13:06,049 --> 01:13:07,259
Help me with the door.

842
01:13:14,141 --> 01:13:16,018
Are you sure that this is safe?

843
01:13:29,239 --> 01:13:31,867
- Stay over there.
- Are you sure that they're here?

844
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:33,160
They have to be.

845
01:13:55,974 --> 01:13:57,184
<i>Está bien.</i>

846
01:14:13,450 --> 01:14:14,660
Sit down.

847
01:14:16,995 --> 01:14:18,121
I don't see them.

848
01:14:18,705 --> 01:14:19,831
Where are they?

849
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:23,085
<i>The border will close in two hours.</i>

850
01:14:38,058 --> 01:14:40,018
Adela. Adela!

851
01:14:40,102 --> 01:14:41,228
Oh!

852
01:14:54,408 --> 01:14:56,159
Cassie. Oh, my God.

853
01:14:56,910 --> 01:14:57,910
You okay?

854
01:14:59,997 --> 01:15:01,206
T.T.?

855
01:15:08,338 --> 01:15:11,067
<i>We have
breaking news now. This is just coming in.</i>

856
01:15:11,091 --> 01:15:13,719
<i>We have been notified
that there has been an attack in El Paso</i>

857
01:15:13,802 --> 01:15:15,470
<i>at a US Army military base.</i>

858
01:15:15,554 --> 01:15:19,391
<i>As a result, the NFFA is pulling
all military troops out of El Paso.</i>

859
01:15:19,474 --> 01:15:22,269
<i>Again, the military is retreating
out of El Paso</i>

860
01:15:22,352 --> 01:15:26,565
<i>after suffering massive losses
in their battle against purgers,</i>

861
01:15:26,648 --> 01:15:29,026
<i>including an attack on a US Army base.</i>

862
01:15:30,193 --> 01:15:33,089
<i>And now I'm hearing
that in response to the army's withdrawal,</i>

863
01:15:33,113 --> 01:15:37,325
<i>Mexico will now be closing their
El Paso border crossing point immediately.</i>

864
01:15:37,409 --> 01:15:40,078
<i>Again, the El Paso border point
will no longer be open</i>

865
01:15:40,162 --> 01:15:42,789
<i>to United States citizens
fleeing the Forever Purge.</i>

866
01:15:42,873 --> 01:15:46,001
<i>Americans left behind
at the now-closed border wall</i>

867
01:15:46,084 --> 01:15:48,295
<i>are being slaughtered by purgers.
It is a war.</i>

868
01:15:48,378 --> 01:15:51,131
<i>El Paso has fallen to Ever After purgers</i>

869
01:15:51,214 --> 01:15:53,425
<i>who are going door to door
hunting down anyone</i>

870
01:15:53,508 --> 01:15:55,177
<i>who is not a part of their hate group.</i>

871
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:57,387
<i>The border is now closed.</i>

872
01:16:05,479 --> 01:16:07,606
This city's gonna get even worse.

873
01:16:08,315 --> 01:16:10,108
Come.

874
01:16:12,277 --> 01:16:16,198
Get out the back. Find Chiago. Move fast.

875
01:16:16,281 --> 01:16:20,327
Tell him to meet us
in the corner of Amboy and Hylan.

876
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:23,413
Tell him if he doesn't do this,
many good people will die.

877
01:16:23,497 --> 01:16:24,998
Including me. Okay?

878
01:16:29,503 --> 01:16:31,546
Okay, let's go! Follow me.

879
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:32,672
I know a way to safety.

880
01:16:32,756 --> 01:16:34,966
I need you to stand up
and walk with us, okay?

881
01:16:35,050 --> 01:16:36,843
- Can you do that?
- I can do it. I got it.

882
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:45,119
<i>The purification will not stop.</i>

883
01:16:45,143 --> 01:16:49,564
<i>This city is now occupied
by the real patriots of America.</i>

884
01:16:49,648 --> 01:16:53,235
<i>Our duty is to uphold
American beliefs and values</i>

885
01:16:53,318 --> 01:16:57,989
<i>while keeping America pure
and free from refugees and terrorists.</i>

886
01:16:58,073 --> 01:17:00,617
<i>We have taken back what is lawfully ours,</i>

887
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:05,747
<i>and we will now embark on purification
of our nation city by city.</i>

888
01:17:05,831 --> 01:17:09,126
<i>Only full-blooded Americans
are welcome here.</i>

889
01:17:09,209 --> 01:17:11,253
<i>All invaders will be purged.</i>

890
01:17:11,336 --> 01:17:15,340
<i>We control El Paso and all of Texas.</i>

891
01:17:15,423 --> 01:17:18,009
<i>The purification will not stop.</i>

892
01:17:18,093 --> 01:17:21,221
<i>This city is now occupied
by the real patriots...</i>

893
01:17:21,304 --> 01:17:22,472
They're clear.

894
01:17:23,765 --> 01:17:25,165
Just keep your voices down.

895
01:17:27,978 --> 01:17:29,521
Listen. Don't move.

896
01:17:30,063 --> 01:17:31,398
Head down.

897
01:17:32,315 --> 01:17:33,525
Who's that?

898
01:17:35,652 --> 01:17:37,070
It's okay. It's okay.

899
01:17:43,243 --> 01:17:44,369
Is it here?

900
01:17:45,370 --> 01:17:47,455
- Guys?
- It's them.

901
01:17:47,539 --> 01:17:48,999
- Hey.
- It's them.

902
01:17:52,043 --> 01:17:54,171
Chiago, take us to Mexico, please.

903
01:17:57,799 --> 01:17:59,634
Get 'em on board. We're leaving.

904
01:17:59,718 --> 01:18:00,886
<i>Gracias,</i> Chiago.

905
01:18:00,969 --> 01:18:02,637
- Okay. Come on. Come on.
- Let's go.

906
01:18:05,056 --> 01:18:06,558
Go, get in the truck.

907
01:18:07,225 --> 01:18:08,435
Let's go. Let's go.

908
01:18:23,158 --> 01:18:24,878
<i>Alpha Leader, come in.</i>

909
01:18:26,244 --> 01:18:27,913
<i>Alpha Leader, do you copy?</i>

910
01:18:30,749 --> 01:18:32,500
<i>- We've found him.</i>
- Where?

911
01:18:32,584 --> 01:18:35,378
<i>They're headed for the border
through the reservation.</i>

912
01:18:35,462 --> 01:18:38,465
Follow 'em. Don't lose 'em. I'll catch up.

913
01:19:11,331 --> 01:19:12,999
How are you getting us across?

914
01:19:13,667 --> 01:19:17,754
My tribe has lived right on the border
of the US and Mexico for centuries.

915
01:19:17,837 --> 01:19:20,382
We were the only people
who could legally cross.

916
01:19:21,466 --> 01:19:22,759
Then the wall split us.

917
01:19:24,427 --> 01:19:29,557
But there are parts of the terrain
those <i>pendejos</i> can't build the wall on.

918
01:19:29,641 --> 01:19:31,184
Too dangerous.

919
01:19:32,686 --> 01:19:34,479
And we use it to make passage.

920
01:19:34,562 --> 01:19:38,900
We'll take you through.
Some of you deserve another chance.

921
01:19:53,790 --> 01:19:55,166
Are you in labor?

922
01:19:58,420 --> 01:20:01,298
- Cassie, we gotta get you to Mexico.
- I know it's bad timing, baby.

923
01:20:01,381 --> 01:20:04,342
You'll be okay.
There'll be help when we get across.

924
01:20:05,135 --> 01:20:07,554
- Camps have been set up, okay?
- Thank you.

925
01:20:16,313 --> 01:20:17,397
Dylan.

926
01:20:19,024 --> 01:20:20,025
Look.

927
01:20:27,741 --> 01:20:29,492
Damn it.

928
01:20:29,576 --> 01:20:30,994
Juan?

929
01:20:31,077 --> 01:20:32,245
Yeah?

930
01:20:32,329 --> 01:20:34,205
Looks like we got trouble coming.

931
01:21:12,077 --> 01:21:13,495
- Let's go. Come on.
- Go, go!

932
01:21:13,578 --> 01:21:16,998
This is the crossing point.
We're on foot from here. Let's go.

933
01:21:17,082 --> 01:21:19,125
- Let's move! Fast.
- Come on. Let's go!

934
01:21:19,209 --> 01:21:21,127
Follow me. I will guide you.

935
01:21:28,301 --> 01:21:29,594
Let's move it! Fast!

936
01:21:31,596 --> 01:21:33,515
They're getting close. We need to move!

937
01:21:33,598 --> 01:21:35,100
- Hey, honey?
- Yeah?

938
01:21:35,183 --> 01:21:37,602
You go let these people
get you across the border, okay?

939
01:21:37,685 --> 01:21:39,646
- Baby, where are you going?
- Yeah, you go ahead.

940
01:21:39,729 --> 01:21:41,231
I love you. I'll be right behind you.

941
01:21:41,314 --> 01:21:44,192
- You have to go with me. Don't leave.
- Go on. I have to stop them.

942
01:21:44,275 --> 01:21:46,778
- Just focus on the baby, okay?
- Cassie, I'll protect you.

943
01:21:46,861 --> 01:21:48,863
- Thank you, sister. You got her?
- Yeah.

944
01:21:48,947 --> 01:21:50,865
We'll see you over there, all right?

945
01:21:50,949 --> 01:21:52,700
Get her to the medics in Mexico.

946
01:21:53,284 --> 01:21:55,662
Get 'em across the border safely!

947
01:21:59,666 --> 01:22:00,875
That's it. On here.

948
01:22:02,210 --> 01:22:03,294
Sit on it.

949
01:22:03,378 --> 01:22:04,712
Put your knees underneath it.

950
01:22:11,511 --> 01:22:13,388
I'm low on ammo. You guys got ammo?

951
01:22:13,471 --> 01:22:14,848
We have a few guns,

952
01:22:14,931 --> 01:22:19,686
but when the bullets run dry,
draw them in close, use blades.

953
01:22:19,769 --> 01:22:21,146
Give me a magazine.

954
01:22:22,313 --> 01:22:25,233
It's the last round of ammo.
Make it count.

955
01:22:25,316 --> 01:22:26,526
We'll help you.

956
01:22:26,609 --> 01:22:28,069
But it's not your fight.

957
01:22:28,153 --> 01:22:30,405
We've been fighting this fight
for 500 years.

958
01:22:31,865 --> 01:22:32,991
Take what you need.

959
01:22:47,881 --> 01:22:50,467
This is our last stand.

960
01:22:54,179 --> 01:22:55,597
On my ready!

961
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:57,307
Let 'em get close!

962
01:23:04,564 --> 01:23:05,982
Wait for 'em!

963
01:23:09,569 --> 01:23:11,029
Wait for it!

964
01:23:35,970 --> 01:23:37,764
Are you okay?

965
01:23:37,847 --> 01:23:40,350
Help her.

966
01:23:44,687 --> 01:23:45,730
Now!

967
01:23:54,656 --> 01:23:56,157
Go! Go, go, go!

968
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,293
Take cover! Now!

969
01:24:11,506 --> 01:24:12,632
I'm out!

970
01:24:16,135 --> 01:24:17,655
- Let's go!
- Come on.

971
01:24:26,604 --> 01:24:27,605
I'm out!

972
01:24:27,689 --> 01:24:30,024
- Yeah, I'm out too.
- I have one left.

973
01:24:38,116 --> 01:24:39,409
Come on, motherfucker!

974
01:25:00,888 --> 01:25:02,015
Fuck!

975
01:25:07,562 --> 01:25:09,731
Hunt 'em down and kill 'em all.

976
01:25:10,773 --> 01:25:14,193
Save that Mexican son of a bitch for me.

977
01:25:14,777 --> 01:25:18,489
- Purge and purify. Ever After!
- Ever After!

978
01:25:46,851 --> 01:25:47,852
They're coming.

979
01:25:47,935 --> 01:25:49,062
Good.

980
01:25:50,438 --> 01:25:52,273
We slow them down.

981
01:25:52,357 --> 01:25:54,484
Give our people more time
to get across safely.

982
01:26:00,490 --> 01:26:02,659
You guys stay in here.
We'll cover the back room.

983
01:27:34,041 --> 01:27:36,043
We got this handled here.

984
01:27:36,127 --> 01:27:38,880
Rest of you go stop 'em
from crossing the border.

985
01:27:38,963 --> 01:27:40,023
- On it.
- Got it.

986
01:27:40,047 --> 01:27:41,047
Let's go.

987
01:27:50,975 --> 01:27:53,015
We're gaining on them. They can't be far.

988
01:28:10,161 --> 01:28:11,161
Adela!

989
01:28:26,594 --> 01:28:27,762
Adela. Adela.

990
01:28:29,472 --> 01:28:31,192
- Adela.
- There he is. Grab him!

991
01:29:27,655 --> 01:29:28,655
Adela!

992
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:31,826
Fucking whore!

993
01:30:23,544 --> 01:30:26,255
Call your people
and tell 'em you need help.

994
01:30:43,439 --> 01:30:45,358
Call out! Now!

995
01:30:49,070 --> 01:30:50,446
Fucking English!

996
01:30:58,204 --> 01:31:00,122
Translate! What are you saying?

997
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:03,626
- Juan!

998
01:31:04,669 --> 01:31:06,671
Translate!

999

Speak fucking English!

1000
01:31:09,966 --> 01:31:12,093
I'll do it! Speak English.

1001
01:31:12,176 --> 01:31:13,719
I will cut your throat!

1002
01:31:14,303 --> 01:31:15,429
Speak E...

1003
01:31:26,691 --> 01:31:27,817
I got him.

1004
01:31:31,696 --> 01:31:33,781
Does this translate?

1005
01:31:33,864 --> 01:31:35,116
<i>Pendejo.</i>

1006
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:30,963
You made it.

1007
01:32:32,131 --> 01:32:33,549
You just crossed into <i>México.</i>

1008
01:32:38,804 --> 01:32:40,056
She'll be there.

1009
01:32:54,612 --> 01:32:55,988
<i>- Gracias.

1010

Thank you. We owe you our lives.

1011
01:33:05,206 --> 01:33:06,207
Hospital?

1012
01:33:07,374 --> 01:33:08,918
Hospital? <i>Médico.</i>

1013

- It's a girl.
- It's a girl?

1020
01:33:37,446 --> 01:33:39,365
You wanna hold your daughter?

1021
01:33:39,448 --> 01:33:41,158

Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
