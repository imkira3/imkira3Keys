1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:01:09,682 --> 00:01:12,048
<i>At first, I didn't believe it either.</i>

3
00:01:12,251 --> 00:01:14,742
<i>But the gods of Olympus are real.</i>

4
00:01:14,954 --> 00:01:18,253
<i>And sometimes, these gods have children with humans...</i>

5
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:20,255
<i>called half-bloods.</i>

6
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,825
<i>I'm one of them.</i>

7
00:01:22,028 --> 00:01:26,055
<i>I'm Percy Jackson.
Son of Poseidon, god of the sea.</i>

8
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:39,876
<i>Seven years ago, four of these children
were headed to Camp Half-Blood...</i>

9
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,606
<i>the only place on Earth that is safe for our kind.</i>

10
00:01:44,584 --> 00:01:46,381
<i>Only three of them made it.</i>

11
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,250
We're almost at camp!

12
00:01:59,332 --> 00:02:00,526
Look out!

13
00:02:02,935 --> 00:02:04,630
Grover! Luke, help him!

14
00:02:04,837 --> 00:02:05,895
Grover, are you okay?

15
00:02:06,005 --> 00:02:08,064
My leg. It's stuck.

16
00:02:12,612 --> 00:02:14,011
Come on. I got you.

17
00:02:14,113 --> 00:02:15,671
Keep going. I'll hold them off.

18
00:02:15,782 --> 00:02:18,876
No, Thalia. They'll kill you.

19
00:02:25,658 --> 00:02:27,888
Go, Luke. I'll be right behind you.

20
00:02:29,262 --> 00:02:30,889
Over here!

21
00:02:31,998 --> 00:02:33,465
Annabeth, come on!

22
00:02:36,102 --> 00:02:37,160
Stay back.

23
00:02:46,145 --> 00:02:47,442
Thalia, come on!

24
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,483
No! Thalia!

25
00:02:57,723 --> 00:03:02,888
<i>Her name was Thalia, and she gave her life to save three.</i>

26
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:11,225
<i>And so, as Thalia lay dying...</i>

27
00:03:11,437 --> 00:03:15,669
<i>her father Zeus found another way for her to live.</i>

28
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:31,083
<i>A way for all half-bloods to live.</i>

29
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:37,126
<i>A gift to ensure no one in Camp Half-Blood
would die the same way.</i>

30
00:03:38,898 --> 00:03:43,961
<i>The barrier, to protect them from those
who lived for their death.</i>

31
00:03:45,705 --> 00:03:47,104
Let's go!

32
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:55,176
<i>Every day, the story of Thalia's bravery inspires me.</i>

33
00:03:57,049 --> 00:04:00,678
<i>And her tree protects my home.</i>

34
00:04:02,488 --> 00:04:05,355
<i>But not always my head.</i>

35
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:16,927
How nice of you to show up just to watch me win.

36
00:04:17,136 --> 00:04:19,900
Everything they say about you is wrong, Clarisse.

37
00:04:20,106 --> 00:04:22,370
You actually do have a sense of humor.

38
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,646
- There goes another one.
- Go, Percy!

39
00:04:34,453 --> 00:04:37,616
Come on, Percy!
I got 50 drachma on you!

40
00:04:38,658 --> 00:04:39,989
You bet on this?

41
00:04:40,192 --> 00:04:41,819
What, is that wrong?

42
00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:49,829
'97 Xinomavro. Would you like a taste?

43
00:04:50,036 --> 00:04:53,597
Why do you torture yourself, Dionysus?

44
00:04:56,542 --> 00:04:58,476
It was one transgression, one.

45
00:04:58,678 --> 00:05:01,146
And with a naiad, for the sake of Olympus.

46
00:05:01,347 --> 00:05:03,338
How was I to know that Zeus had a thing for her?

47
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:06,748
Or that he could hold a grudge for so long?

48
00:05:11,991 --> 00:05:13,686
I think the fact that Zeus is immortal...

49
00:05:13,793 --> 00:05:16,921
means there's no limit to how long he can hold a grudge.

50
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:20,030
The Christians have a guy
who can do this trick in reverse.

51
00:05:20,132 --> 00:05:21,759
Now, that's a god.

52
00:05:24,804 --> 00:05:27,238
Aren't you tired of getting beat, Jackson?

53
00:05:44,557 --> 00:05:46,821
Clarisse!

54
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,227
Help! Help me!

55
00:06:08,914 --> 00:06:10,575
Tereus, grab my hand!

56
00:06:11,317 --> 00:06:13,217
Good luck with that.

57
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,778
I got you.

58
00:06:23,429 --> 00:06:24,589
Thank you!

59
00:06:25,965 --> 00:06:26,932
Percy!

60
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:40,574
Clarisse! Clarisse! Clarisse!

61
00:06:47,787 --> 00:06:50,915
So, what I'm wondering is, Percy...

62
00:06:51,123 --> 00:06:55,059
that first quest you went on, beginner's luck, wasn't it?

63
00:06:55,828 --> 00:06:59,764
Clarisse, he saved Olympus.
That's more than you've ever done.

64
00:07:01,934 --> 00:07:02,992
Whatever.

65
00:07:03,202 --> 00:07:05,403
Even for the daughter of the god of war,
that girl's a mythic bi...

66
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,665
Don't listen to her, Percy.

67
00:07:06,772 --> 00:07:08,467
You know, it's too late.

68
00:07:08,674 --> 00:07:10,835
Besides, she has a point.

69
00:07:11,043 --> 00:07:12,601
Dude, what are you talking about?

70
00:07:12,712 --> 00:07:14,771
You're more than a one-quest wonder.

71
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,939
You recovered Ares' stolen chariot.

72
00:07:17,049 --> 00:07:19,313
No, actually, that was Clarisse.

73
00:07:19,518 --> 00:07:22,783
Okay, what about the Fall Tournament?
You owned that sucker.

74
00:07:22,955 --> 00:07:23,944
Clarisse?

75
00:07:25,124 --> 00:07:27,991
Okay, the Solstice Games?
The Bronze Dragon's Quest?

76
00:07:32,531 --> 00:07:34,931
Thank you for trying to cheer me up.

77
00:07:35,468 --> 00:07:36,867
I would lick a pair of cloven hooves...

78
00:07:36,969 --> 00:07:38,903
before I let you listen to Clarisse instead of us.

79
00:07:39,004 --> 00:07:39,993
No offense, Grover.

80
00:07:40,106 --> 00:07:41,903
None taken. Is that an offer?

81
00:07:42,007 --> 00:07:44,305
Listen, it doesn't matter what Clarisse has done.

82
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,776
To Chiron and Mr. D,
you're still the rock star.

83
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,608
Perry Johnson!

84
00:07:49,081 --> 00:07:51,174
Actually, it's Percy Jackson, sir.

85
00:07:51,383 --> 00:07:52,350
Whatever.

86
00:07:52,551 --> 00:07:55,179
I have a very important task to entrust you with.

87
00:07:55,287 --> 00:07:56,311
You do?

88
00:07:56,422 --> 00:07:59,391
Yes, it's a critical assignment.
And it's very taxing.

89
00:07:59,492 --> 00:08:00,720
Can I trust you?

90
00:08:00,826 --> 00:08:01,815
Of course.

91
00:08:01,927 --> 00:08:03,952
Good. You'll need this.

92
00:08:06,232 --> 00:08:10,464
Sometimes these events get a little messy.

93
00:08:19,311 --> 00:08:21,006
<i>Maybe Clarisse was right.</i>

94
00:08:23,549 --> 00:08:25,881
Maybe I only stopped Luke from destroying Olympus...

95
00:08:25,985 --> 00:08:29,011
because I had Annabeth and Grover helping me, right?

96
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,122
Dad?

97
00:08:34,326 --> 00:08:36,055
Poseidon?

98
00:08:43,636 --> 00:08:48,471
Have you ever felt like everything you've ever done...

99
00:08:48,674 --> 00:08:50,642
maybe you didn't really do it?

100
00:08:51,811 --> 00:08:53,938
It was all just luck or something?

101
00:08:56,749 --> 00:08:58,740
No, of course not.

102
00:08:58,951 --> 00:09:00,441
You're a god.

103
00:09:02,087 --> 00:09:06,717
Speaking as someone who's not, it sucks.

104
00:09:09,328 --> 00:09:12,957
It makes you question whether
you were all that good to begin with.

105
00:09:18,137 --> 00:09:22,130
Okay. Good not talking to you.

106
00:09:22,775 --> 00:09:23,799
Again.

107
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,453
So, he just walked right in?

108
00:09:36,555 --> 00:09:38,455
He just walked straight into camp?

109
00:09:38,557 --> 00:09:40,525
It seems he lumbered, actually.

110
00:09:40,726 --> 00:09:42,694
I don't care if he sashayed!

111
00:09:42,895 --> 00:09:46,422
What's the point of having this mystical
protective barrier if any thing can just...

112
00:09:46,532 --> 00:09:49,330
Could you not touch that, please?
That's a very precious Grenache.

113
00:09:49,435 --> 00:09:50,424
I think the point is...

114
00:09:50,536 --> 00:09:53,630
since he did pass right through
the barrier from Thalia's tree...

115
00:09:53,739 --> 00:09:57,266
- Don't say it.
... it means he's most likely a god-spawn.

116
00:09:59,745 --> 00:10:02,043
Yeah, but the spawn of which god?

117
00:10:02,248 --> 00:10:03,943
I know.

118
00:10:07,987 --> 00:10:09,511
Poseidon.

119
00:10:22,201 --> 00:10:24,897
So, why did Mr. D summon you?
It's not good to get summoned.

120
00:10:25,004 --> 00:10:26,062
I'm sure it's fine.

121
00:10:26,171 --> 00:10:27,205
I'm sure you don't get summoned

122
00:10:27,306 --> 00:10:29,171
to the Big House
without a major-league screw-up.

123
00:10:29,275 --> 00:10:30,435
I didn't screw up.

124
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:32,942
I cleaned the entire coliseum.
And vacuumed.

125
00:10:33,045 --> 00:10:35,013
Don't let him get into your head, okay?

126
00:10:35,114 --> 00:10:37,981
We have a dead camper walking.
Dead camper walking, here.

127
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,880
Thanks. This is friendship.

128
00:10:40,085 --> 00:10:41,916
I'm just playing, just trying to have a little fun.

129
00:10:42,021 --> 00:10:43,249
It's all right.

130
00:10:43,455 --> 00:10:45,480
So, it's okay if I get your cabin
when you get kicked out?

131
00:10:45,591 --> 00:10:47,957
Seriously, don't worry. It's just Mr. D.

132
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,223
I mean, if Chiron had summoned you, then...

133
00:10:55,768 --> 00:10:58,032
You are so massively screwed.

134
00:10:59,805 --> 00:11:02,774
Whatever it is you think I did, I didn't do it.

135
00:11:02,975 --> 00:11:04,465
You've done nothing, Percy.

136
00:11:04,576 --> 00:11:05,736
Exactly.

137
00:11:05,945 --> 00:11:10,348
As you know, you are believed to be Poseidon's only heir.

138
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,244
Yeah, so?

139
00:11:12,451 --> 00:11:16,547
So, it would seem that belief has been held in error.

140
00:11:16,822 --> 00:11:18,813
Hold on.
You're saying Percy has a brother?

141
00:11:18,924 --> 00:11:20,414
Or a sister.

142
00:11:23,162 --> 00:11:26,222
Holy Styx. Another Poseidon half-blood.

143
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:29,032
Not exactly.

144
00:11:30,235 --> 00:11:32,726
Technically, Tyson is not a half-blood.

145
00:11:32,938 --> 00:11:35,168
Half-bloods are half-human,
hence the name.

146
00:11:35,274 --> 00:11:36,468
I don't get it.

147
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:39,874
If this new kid is not half-human,
then what other half is he?

148
00:11:39,979 --> 00:11:42,140
Nymph. Sea nymph.

149
00:11:42,348 --> 00:11:44,509
And when you cross a deity with a nymph, you get...

150
00:11:44,616 --> 00:11:47,210
Don't touch. It's a GewÃ¼rztraminer.

151
00:11:47,419 --> 00:11:48,647
Hi.

152
00:11:50,255 --> 00:11:51,745
Hi, Brother.

153
00:12:13,178 --> 00:12:16,409
So, you're the big shot here, right?
You saved the world and stuff.

154
00:12:16,515 --> 00:12:18,608
Yeah. Yeah.

155
00:12:20,452 --> 00:12:22,613
Hey, they put peppers in yours.

156
00:12:23,122 --> 00:12:24,749
Are you gonna eat that?

157
00:12:25,758 --> 00:12:27,157
Go ahead.

158
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,893
Is he messing with me?

159
00:12:33,098 --> 00:12:34,360
I think he's hungry.

160
00:12:34,466 --> 00:12:36,491
No, not him. I meant Poseidon.

161
00:12:36,702 --> 00:12:38,567
Is this supposed to be some kind of joke?

162
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,935
A half-brother? A Cyclops? Come on.

163
00:12:43,842 --> 00:12:47,073
I think the politically correct term
is "ocularly impaired. "

164
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,746
And a half-brother
is better than nothing.

165
00:12:48,847 --> 00:12:50,246
I like having a brother.

166
00:12:50,349 --> 00:12:51,941
Dad was cool to bring me here.

167
00:12:52,051 --> 00:12:53,746
Dad? Dad brought you here?

168
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,417
I was upstate, in the woods.

169
00:12:56,522 --> 00:13:00,686
One day, this trident shows up over
my head, and then it started moving south.

170
00:13:00,793 --> 00:13:04,320
And you followed it.
You followed it here.

171
00:13:04,897 --> 00:13:06,296
It glowed.

172
00:13:06,498 --> 00:13:09,524
Well, somebody has got a new brother.

173
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:12,933
And I can see he's got his daddy's eyes.

174
00:13:13,138 --> 00:13:14,105
Well...

175
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,807
"Eye. "

176
00:13:17,142 --> 00:13:19,736
You should really get him some sprayable mist.

177
00:13:19,912 --> 00:13:23,541
Anyway, it is kind of interesting timing,
don't you think?

178
00:13:23,749 --> 00:13:28,652
Maybe Poseidon decided he needed
another son to, you know...

179
00:13:28,854 --> 00:13:29,946
represent.

180
00:13:30,155 --> 00:13:31,486
Bull.

181
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,118
Excuse me?

182
00:13:33,325 --> 00:13:34,656
Smells like bull.

183
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,828
We got barrier action.

184
00:13:48,574 --> 00:13:50,166
Hey, Chris, you coming?

185
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,536
No, I'm good.

186
00:14:03,388 --> 00:14:05,015
That is so awesome.

187
00:14:07,025 --> 00:14:09,755
It's chill. The barrier is holding.

188
00:14:18,804 --> 00:14:19,930
A Colchis bull.

189
00:14:20,038 --> 00:14:21,232
Run!

190
00:14:34,319 --> 00:14:35,286
Percy!

191
00:14:36,455 --> 00:14:37,444
Come on!

192
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,150
- We have to find its weak spot.
- Does it have one?

193
00:15:07,252 --> 00:15:09,243
Percy, distract it for me.

194
00:15:50,862 --> 00:15:52,454
I got this.

195
00:16:35,774 --> 00:16:36,763
Bad bull.

196
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,041
Hey, rust bucket!

197
00:17:59,324 --> 00:18:01,349
Damn it, Jackson.

198
00:18:03,862 --> 00:18:08,356
Do you have any idea
how hard Colchis bulls are to come by?

199
00:18:09,501 --> 00:18:11,992
Maybe next time you try to drown someone...

200
00:18:13,138 --> 00:18:17,973
you'll first make sure he's not a demigod who can swim.

201
00:18:23,348 --> 00:18:24,406
Luke?

202
00:18:24,516 --> 00:18:28,008
Turns out, you're not the only
half-blood who's hard to kill.

203
00:18:30,722 --> 00:18:32,781
You know, prophecy.

204
00:18:34,426 --> 00:18:37,054
What prophecy?
What are you talking about?

205
00:18:37,262 --> 00:18:38,729
You don't know?

206
00:18:39,531 --> 00:18:40,520
Huh.

207
00:18:41,199 --> 00:18:45,568
Add that to the long list of things
your buddy Chiron hasn't shared with you.

208
00:18:46,571 --> 00:18:49,699
Chiron, Mr. D, all the rest...

209
00:18:50,709 --> 00:18:52,836
they don't care about us.

210
00:18:53,378 --> 00:18:56,142
To them, we're just kids.

211
00:18:56,348 --> 00:18:59,613
A bunch of pawns meant to be
pushed around, told what to do.

212
00:19:00,018 --> 00:19:02,452
I'm not the only half-blood
who thinks so.

213
00:19:05,424 --> 00:19:06,652
Think about it.

214
00:19:20,205 --> 00:19:21,433
What did I miss?

215
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,734
Where's Percy?

216
00:19:22,841 --> 00:19:25,935
Last time I saw him,
he was getting dragged by a Colchis bull.

217
00:19:26,044 --> 00:19:27,909
Hey, you.

218
00:19:28,346 --> 00:19:29,677
How come you aren't barbecued?

219
00:19:29,781 --> 00:19:31,339
Cyclopes are fireproof.

220
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:33,884
How did the bull get through the barrier?

221
00:19:35,387 --> 00:19:37,184
Oh, my gods.

222
00:20:00,045 --> 00:20:01,342
Poisoned.

223
00:20:01,546 --> 00:20:03,446
Is she... Is the tree dead?

224
00:20:03,648 --> 00:20:05,206
No, but dying.

225
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,614
A condition we're about to become all too familiar with.

226
00:20:12,157 --> 00:20:16,116
Everybody, we're going to need
a guard detail to patrol the perimeter.

227
00:20:16,328 --> 00:20:19,195
It feels like she's dying all over again.

228
00:20:20,332 --> 00:20:22,357
Who would do this?

229
00:20:23,401 --> 00:20:25,096
Luke poisoned the tree.

230
00:20:25,971 --> 00:20:27,199
Percy!

231
00:20:27,572 --> 00:20:29,335
Yay, you're alive.

232
00:20:30,075 --> 00:20:32,270
Yeah, I'm not the only one.

233
00:20:32,911 --> 00:20:34,378
Luke let the bull in.

234
00:20:34,579 --> 00:20:35,978
Without the tree's barrier...

235
00:20:36,081 --> 00:20:37,878
he probably figures there's enough

236
00:20:37,983 --> 00:20:39,644
demi-Titans out there
to get him what he wants.

237
00:20:39,751 --> 00:20:41,946
And that would be what, exactly?

238
00:20:42,654 --> 00:20:45,350
Our annihilation, Ms. La Rue.

239
00:20:45,857 --> 00:20:47,984
Our annihilation.

240
00:20:56,234 --> 00:20:57,599
How's the antidote coming?

241
00:20:57,702 --> 00:20:58,964
Slowly.

242
00:21:00,338 --> 00:21:02,806
I know this probably isn't the best time...

243
00:21:05,176 --> 00:21:06,609
but there's something I have to ask you.

244
00:21:06,711 --> 00:21:08,042
What is it?

245
00:21:10,048 --> 00:21:12,642
It was something Luke said about a prophecy...

246
00:21:12,851 --> 00:21:14,819
how I'm mentioned in it.

247
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,679
Do you know anything about this?

248
00:21:19,558 --> 00:21:22,220
Knowledge isn't always power, Percy.

249
00:21:23,028 --> 00:21:25,019
Sometimes, it's a burden.

250
00:21:25,697 --> 00:21:27,221
I know that.

251
00:21:28,233 --> 00:21:31,267
But like you said, I've been pretty unexceptional lately.

252
00:21:31,369 --> 00:21:35,465
It's got me wondering
if I'm prophecy-worthy.

253
00:21:35,674 --> 00:21:37,972
They say that when the gods wish to torture us...

254
00:21:38,076 --> 00:21:39,839
they answer our prayers.

255
00:21:40,045 --> 00:21:43,640
Necklace of Harmonia, Hercules' bow,
Golden Apple of Discord.

256
00:21:44,082 --> 00:21:45,640
Three millennia of gods and demigods...

257
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,810
you'd think that someone would have
come up with a cure for Thalia's tree.

258
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,583
Persephone did come up with Miracle-Gro.
Maybe we can try that.

259
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,053
That's it.

260
00:21:55,293 --> 00:21:56,590
Right here.

261
00:21:57,929 --> 00:22:01,126
That is not gonna cure Thalia's tree
so much as get us all killed.

262
00:22:01,232 --> 00:22:02,426
Me, in particular.

263
00:22:02,534 --> 00:22:05,367
It's perfect. It's exactly what we need.

264
00:22:06,871 --> 00:22:08,338
I'm taking this to Mr. D.

265
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,498
No.

266
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:19,146
I was hoping to spare you this onus
a little while longer, but go inside.

267
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,717
Upstairs, to the attic.

268
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:23,310
And when you come back down, we'll talk some more.

269
00:22:23,421 --> 00:22:26,117
Assuming you're still sane, that is.

270
00:22:59,157 --> 00:23:01,557
I am the spirit of Delphi...

271
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,593
speaker of the prophecies of Phoebus Apollo...

272
00:23:04,796 --> 00:23:07,060
slayer of the mighty Python.

273
00:23:07,265 --> 00:23:10,894
Approach, seeker, and ask.

274
00:23:13,304 --> 00:23:15,704
I heard there was a prophecy about me.

275
00:23:15,907 --> 00:23:17,272
Aye.

276
00:23:17,475 --> 00:23:22,242
But before you learn the future, know first the past.

277
00:23:24,182 --> 00:23:27,583
<i>Long ago, before our time...</i>

278
00:23:27,786 --> 00:23:29,811
<i>before Olympus and the gods...</i>

279
00:23:30,021 --> 00:23:33,286
<i>Titans ruled the world.</i>

280
00:23:33,858 --> 00:23:35,553
<i>Led by Kronos...</i>

281
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,163
<i>a force so evil, he devoured his own children.</i>

282
00:23:40,365 --> 00:23:42,833
<i>But three of his sons escaped.</i>

283
00:23:43,034 --> 00:23:46,299
<i>Zeus, Hades and Poseidon.</i>

284
00:23:51,309 --> 00:23:52,901
<i>They destroyed Kronos...</i>

285
00:23:53,011 --> 00:23:57,573
<i>and banished his remains to the depths of Tartarus.</i>

286
00:23:58,349 --> 00:24:02,479
<i>But Kronos is fated to rise again...</i>

287
00:24:02,687 --> 00:24:07,386
<i>to exact his vengeance on Olympus, and the world.</i>

288
00:24:09,227 --> 00:24:14,494
<i>Only one half-blood child of the
three eldest gods can defeat him.</i>

289
00:24:14,699 --> 00:24:17,896
<i>This child shall be our salvation...</i>

290
00:24:18,103 --> 00:24:21,231
<i>or the cause of our destruction.</i>

291
00:24:24,008 --> 00:24:28,468
<i>It all begins when two cousins grapple for a fleece...</i>

292
00:24:28,913 --> 00:24:31,882
<i>the son of the sea and the lightning thief.</i>

293
00:24:32,751 --> 00:24:33,809
Luke.

294
00:24:34,018 --> 00:24:36,509
And that half-blood
of the eldest gods...

295
00:24:36,721 --> 00:24:39,656
shall reach 20 against all odds.

296
00:24:39,858 --> 00:24:43,089
"And see the world in endless sleep...

297
00:24:43,294 --> 00:24:47,060
"the evil soul, cursed blade shall reap.

298
00:24:47,265 --> 00:24:49,096
"A single choice shall end his days...

299
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,567
"Olympus to preserve or raze. "

300
00:24:52,771 --> 00:24:56,207
And that is "raze" with a "Z",
as in "destroy. "

301
00:24:56,741 --> 00:24:58,208
I asked.

302
00:25:00,712 --> 00:25:04,580
Is there any chance, any chance at all...

303
00:25:04,783 --> 00:25:08,014
that I might not be the guy in the prophecy?

304
00:25:08,219 --> 00:25:11,052
The Oracle references
a half-blood of the eldest gods.

305
00:25:11,156 --> 00:25:16,253
You are the only living half-blood heir
of Zeus, Hades or Poseidon.

306
00:25:16,461 --> 00:25:18,759
The prophecy could refer only to you.

307
00:25:18,963 --> 00:25:22,524
What if I destroy Olympus...

308
00:25:22,734 --> 00:25:25,862
by not being good enough to save it?

309
00:25:26,971 --> 00:25:29,405
That seems to be the question, doesn't it?

310
00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:32,137
It's absolutely out of the question.

311
00:25:32,243 --> 00:25:34,211
If you could just listen to me for one moment...

312
00:25:34,312 --> 00:25:36,246
I am listening.
You want to go on a quest.

313
00:25:36,347 --> 00:25:37,644
It must be Thursday.

314
00:25:37,749 --> 00:25:40,877
I'm serious.
I'm absolutely sure that this is gonna work.

315
00:25:42,987 --> 00:25:44,648
It was such a good year.

316
00:25:44,856 --> 00:25:47,450
The Golden Fleece can heal any living person or thing...

317
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:49,857
including Thalia's tree.

318
00:25:50,061 --> 00:25:53,189
We heal the tree, we restore the barrier around camp.

319
00:25:54,165 --> 00:25:56,565
I'm surprised you want to go along
with her on this, Mr. Undershirt.

320
00:25:56,668 --> 00:25:57,635
Underwood.

321
00:25:57,735 --> 00:25:58,861
Whatever.

322
00:25:59,304 --> 00:26:02,705
Every satyr who has ever gone after the Fleece has died.

323
00:26:02,907 --> 00:26:05,375
Right? I mentioned that to her.

324
00:26:06,211 --> 00:26:10,011
But it's a risk I'm willing to take
for the good of the camp.

325
00:26:10,715 --> 00:26:13,013
Look, the last I heard...

326
00:26:13,218 --> 00:26:15,880
the Golden Fleece was in the Sea of Monsters...

327
00:26:15,987 --> 00:26:18,046
what the humans call the Bermuda Triangle.

328
00:26:18,156 --> 00:26:20,556
A place not only a satyr should be afraid of.

329
00:26:20,658 --> 00:26:24,389
So, the answer is no. No.
I'm sorry, Annabelle.

330
00:26:24,529 --> 00:26:25,496
Annabeth.

331
00:26:25,597 --> 00:26:28,657
Whatever. It's a terrible idea.

332
00:26:28,867 --> 00:26:31,301
I've had a grand idea.

333
00:26:33,171 --> 00:26:35,571
Unless Thalia's tree can be cured...

334
00:26:35,773 --> 00:26:39,903
and the protective barrier around our camp restored...

335
00:26:40,111 --> 00:26:43,740
then every demigod, centaur, satyr and nymph...

336
00:26:44,282 --> 00:26:46,648
will be killed within days, if not sooner.

337
00:26:46,751 --> 00:26:48,412
Hey, you okay?

338
00:26:49,087 --> 00:26:51,555
Don't worry, camp will be okay.

339
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:54,021
You have to have faith, right?

340
00:26:54,125 --> 00:26:56,719
But fortunately, I have considered the matter.

341
00:26:57,528 --> 00:26:58,495
And after great study...

342
00:26:58,596 --> 00:27:01,929
I have determined that the only thing
that has the power to save Thalia's tree...

343
00:27:02,033 --> 00:27:03,728
and therefore our home...

344
00:27:03,868 --> 00:27:05,859
is the Golden Fleece of myth...

345
00:27:08,273 --> 00:27:09,399
What?

346
00:27:10,108 --> 00:27:11,370
...whose touch...

347
00:27:14,445 --> 00:27:17,414
...can heal every person
and every thing.

348
00:27:18,983 --> 00:27:23,010
So, a quest, a mission of mercy, if you will...

349
00:27:23,221 --> 00:27:25,621
into uncharted and deadly waters...

350
00:27:26,024 --> 00:27:29,050
with nothing less at stake than our own survival.

351
00:27:29,694 --> 00:27:35,326
Now, a satyr is naturally drawn,
as you know, to the power of the Fleece.

352
00:27:35,533 --> 00:27:39,594
And therefore, it must be a satyr
who will guide a half-blood on this quest.

353
00:27:39,971 --> 00:27:41,438
Thanks a lot.

354
00:27:42,106 --> 00:27:43,164
Ichneutae!

355
00:27:43,775 --> 00:27:45,766
Will you guide the champion?

356
00:27:45,977 --> 00:27:47,638
Oh, yeah.

357
00:27:47,845 --> 00:27:50,643
Good. Great! That's great!

358
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:53,017
Yeah!

359
00:27:56,020 --> 00:28:01,014
As to who that champion might be,
our plight calls for only our finest hero.

360
00:28:01,693 --> 00:28:05,925
The best of us, the strongest and the bravest.

361
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:09,588
The scion of the god of war...

362
00:28:09,801 --> 00:28:10,790
Clarisse!

363
00:28:11,436 --> 00:28:12,403
Yes!

364
00:28:16,174 --> 00:28:17,232
Thank you.

365
00:28:18,876 --> 00:28:20,537
Her name, he gets right.

366
00:28:25,183 --> 00:28:27,276
Hey, Clarisse. Clarisse!

367
00:28:27,485 --> 00:28:28,452
What?

368
00:28:29,287 --> 00:28:31,687
Don't worry about always coming in second, Jackson.

369
00:28:31,789 --> 00:28:33,347
You do get used to it.

370
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:35,449
I think, right?
Obviously, I wouldn't know.

371
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,754
Listen, Luke is still out there.

372
00:28:36,861 --> 00:28:39,227
He's involved with the Fleece somehow...

373
00:28:39,564 --> 00:28:42,089
and I've got a feeling that he's not done yet.

374
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,167
Really?

375
00:28:43,334 --> 00:28:46,030
Because I've got a feeling that I don't really care.

376
00:28:46,137 --> 00:28:47,934
Gosh, don't look so wounded.

377
00:28:49,173 --> 00:28:51,437
Listen, there are generals, and there are foot soldiers.

378
00:28:51,542 --> 00:28:54,705
And you should feel lucky that you even
made it into the army at all.

379
00:28:54,812 --> 00:28:58,339
Just try not to screw up anything
too badly while I'm gone. Okay?

380
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:00,451
Let's go.

381
00:29:10,361 --> 00:29:13,023
"Cursed blade shall reap. "

382
00:29:14,665 --> 00:29:16,724
"Cursed blade shall reap. "

383
00:29:18,069 --> 00:29:21,835
What good is a prophecy if you can't even understand it?

384
00:29:25,176 --> 00:29:28,009
I guess you don't have any answers either, Dad.

385
00:29:29,514 --> 00:29:31,141
This was your sword.

386
00:29:43,528 --> 00:29:44,495
This is a bad idea.

387
00:29:44,595 --> 00:29:45,962
You don't even know what I was gonna say.

388
00:29:45,963 --> 00:29:48,454
You were going to say that you're
going after the Fleece to save the camp.

389
00:29:48,566 --> 00:29:51,034
Actually, he was gonna say "we" were.

390
00:29:52,236 --> 00:29:54,397
Look, I get what you're doing here.

391
00:29:54,605 --> 00:29:56,239
You're worried about
the one-quest wonder thing...

392
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,935
and you want to make your bones.

393
00:29:58,042 --> 00:30:00,169
But Ichneutae and Clarisse
are already going after the Fleece...

394
00:30:00,278 --> 00:30:02,644
and it's not cool to bogart on someone else's quest.

395
00:30:02,747 --> 00:30:04,510
I think this is my quest, too.

396
00:30:04,615 --> 00:30:06,378
The Oracle says he wrestles Luke for the Fleece.

397
00:30:06,484 --> 00:30:09,749
"Grapples. " But she also said...

398
00:30:10,822 --> 00:30:13,916
that I'm destined to destroy Olympus, or save it.

399
00:30:17,128 --> 00:30:19,392
Saving is better, obviously.

400
00:30:19,597 --> 00:30:20,996
Yeah.

401
00:30:21,933 --> 00:30:25,369
Let me pack a bag and make sure
my health insurance is paid up.

402
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:43,120
How are we gonna get past them?

403
00:30:43,321 --> 00:30:45,221
I think they're looking for threats trying to come in...

404
00:30:45,323 --> 00:30:47,689
not people trying to sneak out...

405
00:30:47,892 --> 00:30:50,588
so, I think we're cool as long as we stay quiet.

406
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:53,897
Sorry!

407
00:30:58,269 --> 00:30:59,395
We're...

408
00:31:00,671 --> 00:31:02,263
We're guarding, too.

409
00:31:03,674 --> 00:31:04,732
You left without me.

410
00:31:04,842 --> 00:31:07,572
Tyson, where we're going, it's very dangerous.

411
00:31:07,778 --> 00:31:09,143
I know. I'm not stupid.

412
00:31:09,247 --> 00:31:10,544
No, just dumb.

413
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,145
I want to help.

414
00:31:13,651 --> 00:31:15,084
You'd do it for me.

415
00:31:15,286 --> 00:31:16,776
I appreciate that...

416
00:31:16,988 --> 00:31:20,822
but I don't think you understand
exactly how dangerous this is going to be.

417
00:31:20,925 --> 00:31:22,051
I do.

418
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,421
The Fleece is guarded by Polyphemus.

419
00:31:24,729 --> 00:31:25,696
Who?

420
00:31:25,796 --> 00:31:26,922
Polyphemus.

421
00:31:27,131 --> 00:31:29,759
Closest thing Cyclopes have got to someone famous.

422
00:31:29,867 --> 00:31:33,132
Captured Odysseus. Lives in Circeland.

423
00:31:33,337 --> 00:31:34,804
Wait, Circeland?

424
00:31:35,006 --> 00:31:36,405
Built on his island.

425
00:31:36,507 --> 00:31:37,906
Long story.

426
00:31:38,109 --> 00:31:40,270
Point is, maybe I can talk to him.

427
00:31:40,478 --> 00:31:42,446
You know, Cyclops to Cyclops.

428
00:31:42,647 --> 00:31:45,514
No, you can't, because I'm not going with a Cyclops.

429
00:31:47,051 --> 00:31:50,179
Then we got a problem, because I'm not going without one.

430
00:31:50,521 --> 00:31:54,719
This Polyphemus is probably what killed
every satyr that's gone near the Fleece.

431
00:31:54,825 --> 00:31:56,759
You want me to lead you to a Cyclops?
Fine.

432
00:31:56,861 --> 00:32:00,126
But I'm bringing along one of my own, for protection.

433
00:32:00,831 --> 00:32:02,025
No way.

434
00:32:02,733 --> 00:32:03,700
No.

435
00:32:11,475 --> 00:32:13,409
What do you think's gonna attract more attention...

436
00:32:13,511 --> 00:32:15,035
all the noise or the one eye?

437
00:32:15,146 --> 00:32:17,114
Just give the guy a break, okay?

438
00:32:18,749 --> 00:32:19,807
Okay, fine.

439
00:32:19,917 --> 00:32:20,906
Keep it down.

440
00:32:21,018 --> 00:32:23,213
This is crazy hard to come by...

441
00:32:23,421 --> 00:32:25,389
and I only brought it along in case of an emergency...

442
00:32:25,489 --> 00:32:29,721
which I guess this is an emergency,
so... here.

443
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:33,354
Mist?

444
00:32:33,564 --> 00:32:35,589
It makes the mystical look normal.

445
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,327
"Side effects may include handsomeness,

446
00:32:37,435 --> 00:32:39,801
headache, self-esteem
and low self-esteem. "

447
00:32:39,904 --> 00:32:41,804
And just know that if the camp wasn't in danger...

448
00:32:41,906 --> 00:32:43,237
I wouldn't be wasting this on you.

449
00:32:43,341 --> 00:32:44,706
Wasting what?

450
00:32:46,844 --> 00:32:50,177
It's not gonna last forever.
You're gonna have to reapply it.

451
00:32:59,023 --> 00:33:00,615
Extreme makeover alert.

452
00:33:04,161 --> 00:33:05,458
How do I look?

453
00:33:06,664 --> 00:33:09,189
A bit like Dad, actually.

454
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,368
He's still a Cyclops.

455
00:33:12,803 --> 00:33:16,261
Grover, where are we going?
What does your nose say?

456
00:33:17,174 --> 00:33:19,870
Somewhere off the coast of Florida.
South.

457
00:33:21,979 --> 00:33:23,105
Over here.

458
00:33:23,314 --> 00:33:24,747
Annie! Hey!

459
00:33:38,729 --> 00:33:40,788
It's the Chariot of Damnation.

460
00:33:40,998 --> 00:33:43,091
Looks like a New York City cab.

461
00:33:43,301 --> 00:33:44,632
Same difference.

462
00:33:46,771 --> 00:33:49,638
No dollars, no credit cards.
Drachmas only.

463
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,603
Exact... Change... Please.

464
00:33:51,809 --> 00:33:53,436
Chop, chop! Get in the cab.

465
00:33:53,544 --> 00:33:56,411
We just had this cab sanitized for your protection.

466
00:33:56,614 --> 00:33:57,911
It wasn't this year, though.

467
00:33:58,015 --> 00:34:00,449
Excuse me, we're trying to get to Florida.

468
00:34:00,818 --> 00:34:03,252
Our kind of fare. Pricey.

469
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,923
<i>Hey, there.
This is Ganymede, cupbearer to Zeus.</i>

470
00:34:11,128 --> 00:34:13,460
<i>And when I'm out buying wine for the lord of the skies...</i>

471
00:34:13,564 --> 00:34:15,429
<i>I always remember to buckle up.</i>

472
00:34:15,533 --> 00:34:17,797
Maybe we should have flown commercial.

473
00:34:20,237 --> 00:34:21,295
Look out!

474
00:34:24,408 --> 00:34:26,569
Calm down.
If we didn't know what we were doing...

475
00:34:26,677 --> 00:34:28,304
We wouldn't be licensed.

476
00:34:31,248 --> 00:34:32,738
They don't have eyes.

477
00:34:33,751 --> 00:34:34,979
Yeah.

478
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,679
- I know, awful picture.
- Bad hair day.

479
00:34:38,789 --> 00:34:40,120
We do so have an eye.

480
00:34:40,224 --> 00:34:41,885
It's around here somewhere.

481
00:34:41,992 --> 00:34:44,620
The last time I saw it, you put it
in the glove compartment, Anger.

482
00:34:44,762 --> 00:34:46,161
Don't use that tone with my name.

483
00:34:46,263 --> 00:34:48,026
It's not there this time.

484
00:34:50,434 --> 00:34:52,732
Wasp always puts it with the keys.

485
00:34:53,404 --> 00:34:56,100
- And it's 20/20.
- So is mine!

486
00:34:56,307 --> 00:34:58,366
Shouldn't the driver get the eye?

487
00:34:59,377 --> 00:35:01,106
She'll be fine.

488
00:35:05,383 --> 00:35:06,748
Tempest, split!

489
00:35:12,723 --> 00:35:13,690
Percy!

490
00:35:16,594 --> 00:35:18,494
We paid extra for that option.

491
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,694
The kid is right.
The driver should have the eyeball.

492
00:35:25,803 --> 00:35:26,997
He's a freaking genius!

493
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:28,537
You're the one that put it in the visor.

494
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:32,166
While it's on the table,
I haven't had a turn in quite some time.

495
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:35,039
Oh, no, you didn't!

496
00:35:35,246 --> 00:35:36,372
Yes, I did.

497
00:35:39,483 --> 00:35:41,041
Hands on the wheel at least, okay?

498
00:35:45,122 --> 00:35:46,555
- We're all gonna die!
- Pipe down.

499
00:35:46,657 --> 00:35:49,990
Didn't that prophecy say
you're gonna make it till at least 20?

500
00:35:50,094 --> 00:35:51,152
You know about the prophecy?

501
00:35:51,262 --> 00:35:52,991
- Sure.
- The Oracle is a friend.

502
00:35:53,097 --> 00:35:54,928
- We're besties.
- B-F-F!

503
00:35:56,567 --> 00:35:57,761
Eye! Eye! Eye!

504
00:35:57,968 --> 00:35:59,833
Gross! Get it off me!

505
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,001
What do you know about the prophecy?

506
00:36:07,011 --> 00:36:07,978
No!

507
00:36:11,315 --> 00:36:12,407
Okay, okay.

508
00:36:13,717 --> 00:36:19,451
30, 31, 75, 12.

509
00:36:19,657 --> 00:36:20,624
What?

510
00:36:21,926 --> 00:36:23,450
Percy, you got your answer!

511
00:36:23,561 --> 00:36:25,119
All I got were numbers.

512
00:36:25,229 --> 00:36:26,662
- Yes.
- You'll know...

513
00:36:26,864 --> 00:36:28,491
When it matters.

514
00:36:31,702 --> 00:36:33,499
I think we're a little short on drachmas.

515
00:36:33,604 --> 00:36:34,571
What?

516
00:36:47,117 --> 00:36:48,518
What do you... think we're...
running here?

517
00:36:48,619 --> 00:36:49,517
A charity?

518
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:52,755
- Get your cheap butts...
- Out!

519
00:37:01,632 --> 00:37:02,690
That was...

520
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,094
I know.

521
00:37:04,802 --> 00:37:07,566
Awesome! Can we go again?

522
00:37:07,771 --> 00:37:09,864
We're definitely not in Florida.

523
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:13,400
I think we're in Olympus.

524
00:37:14,078 --> 00:37:17,343
Hail to you, great Zeus!
Forgive our trespass on Olympus.

525
00:37:17,548 --> 00:37:20,176
We're seeking transport to Florida.

526
00:37:20,985 --> 00:37:21,952
Zeus?

527
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,587
Zeus?

528
00:37:24,154 --> 00:37:25,121
Zeus?

529
00:37:25,322 --> 00:37:28,314
Whoa, stop it, stop it, stop it!
This isn't Olympus, okay?

530
00:37:28,425 --> 00:37:30,052
This is the Capitol building.

531
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,958
We're in Washington, D.C. Okay?

532
00:37:35,232 --> 00:37:36,358
It looks like Olympus.

533
00:37:36,467 --> 00:37:39,368
Right down to the dudes with power
who only care about themselves.

534
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:41,335
We need to find a bus station.

535
00:37:41,438 --> 00:37:43,429
First we need to get some money.

536
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:51,079
<i>Hey, there,
valued half-blood account holder!</i>

537
00:37:51,181 --> 00:37:54,173
<i>Sign up for our new Aphrodite Express
credit card, and you can...</i>

538
00:37:54,285 --> 00:37:58,312
Can I get four
venti half-caf no-whip lattes?

539
00:37:58,522 --> 00:38:01,252
And an extra shot of nectar.

540
00:38:07,565 --> 00:38:08,532
Nectar?

541
00:38:08,632 --> 00:38:11,430
If you haven't had, then you haven't lived, buddy.

542
00:38:17,841 --> 00:38:19,468
Hecatonshire.

543
00:38:19,677 --> 00:38:20,644
Hey.

544
00:38:21,779 --> 00:38:23,906
I see you got your hands full.

545
00:38:26,717 --> 00:38:27,979
Room for cream?

546
00:38:28,118 --> 00:38:31,178
Nectar. Double shot.

547
00:38:39,697 --> 00:38:41,289
I've lived.

548
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:44,566
This might be the most fun I've ever had.

549
00:38:44,768 --> 00:38:45,894
Ever.

550
00:38:46,103 --> 00:38:49,630
Yeah, anything's gotta be better
than living in the woods, right?

551
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,308
Living in the woods would have been fine
if you were there.

552
00:38:52,409 --> 00:38:54,536
Everything's better with a brother.

553
00:38:55,479 --> 00:38:58,141
You know, technically, we don't have the same mom.

554
00:38:58,248 --> 00:39:01,809
So we're still brothers!
I know! How cool is that?

555
00:39:02,019 --> 00:39:03,384
Arctic.

556
00:39:05,155 --> 00:39:06,486
It's too sweet, don't you think?

557
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,888
No, nectar's never too sweet.

558
00:39:13,497 --> 00:39:14,964
Get off me!

559
00:39:15,432 --> 00:39:17,229
- Get off me!
- Grover!

560
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,501
Percy!

561
00:39:32,449 --> 00:39:34,542
- Damn!
- Was that Chris Rodriguez?

562
00:39:34,752 --> 00:39:36,481
How did they do that?

563
00:39:37,888 --> 00:39:41,551
Back at camp, Luke said that
there were other half-bloods who turned.

564
00:39:41,659 --> 00:39:43,422
What do you mean, "turned"?

565
00:39:44,028 --> 00:39:45,620
To his side.

566
00:39:47,531 --> 00:39:48,828
Luke has Grover.

567
00:39:50,067 --> 00:39:51,728
The Oracle was right.

568
00:39:51,935 --> 00:39:55,200
Luke is going after the Fleece.
That's why he needs a satyr.

569
00:39:55,706 --> 00:39:57,333
But what does Luke want with the Fleece anyway?

570
00:39:57,441 --> 00:39:58,499
I don't know.

571
00:39:58,609 --> 00:40:00,770
But if we're gonna get Grover back, we need to find Luke.

572
00:40:00,878 --> 00:40:02,778
But we don't know where he is.

573
00:40:07,184 --> 00:40:09,880
I know someone who does. Come on.

574
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:20,318
What, are we shipping ourselves
overnight express to the Sea of Monsters?

575
00:40:20,431 --> 00:40:23,559
You want to find Luke?
His dad will know where he is.

576
00:40:30,607 --> 00:40:33,235
Olympic Parcel Service. Come on.

577
00:40:33,444 --> 00:40:34,775
Like it? He'll love it.

578
00:40:34,878 --> 00:40:38,541
Yes, Hephaestus does do quality work.
Everyone else these days, hacks.

579
00:40:38,649 --> 00:40:40,344
Excuse me, we're looking for Hermes.

580
00:40:40,451 --> 00:40:43,386
I'm sorry to be the god of obviousness,
but I'm with a customer.

581
00:40:43,487 --> 00:40:47,116
You want an overnight shipment to Hades,
that will be 250 drachmas.

582
00:40:47,758 --> 00:40:49,783
Perfect. Thank you, sweetness.

583
00:40:49,993 --> 00:40:53,326
I will take care of that for you,
and I'll see you next week.

584
00:40:53,731 --> 00:40:55,426
Now, you.

585
00:40:55,632 --> 00:40:57,190
You are here about Hermes?

586
00:40:57,301 --> 00:40:59,166
His son, actually.
It's kind of important.

587
00:40:59,269 --> 00:41:02,067
Yeah, I could tell the way you burst in here,
all rude-like.

588
00:41:02,172 --> 00:41:04,231
His son's name is Luke Castellan.

589
00:41:07,277 --> 00:41:10,804
What has that wayward boy of mine
gotten himself into now?

590
00:41:11,348 --> 00:41:13,145
Wait, you're...

591
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:14,239
Hermes.

592
00:41:14,451 --> 00:41:16,646
Little insulted you didn't recognize me.

593
00:41:16,754 --> 00:41:20,053
My feelings might have even been hurt
if I wasn't such a self-confident individual.

594
00:41:20,157 --> 00:41:22,182
I don't know if you noticed,
but I'm killing these shorts.

595
00:41:22,292 --> 00:41:23,350
Sir, we're looking for Luke...

596
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,587
because he attacked Camp Half-Blood
and kidnapped our friend.

597
00:41:25,696 --> 00:41:28,426
And we really need your help,
and we don't have a lot of time.

598
00:41:28,532 --> 00:41:31,729
That's really cute,
how you finish each other's sentences.

599
00:41:33,003 --> 00:41:34,061
Follow.

600
00:41:35,806 --> 00:41:38,969
You like this tie? I just bought it.
HermÃ¨s, of course.

601
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:40,568
Check it out.

602
00:41:40,677 --> 00:41:43,237
State-of-the-art sorting,
processing and packaging facility.

603
00:41:43,347 --> 00:41:46,077
If you can box it, we can ship it at the speed of...

604
00:41:46,183 --> 00:41:47,741
Well, me.

605
00:41:47,951 --> 00:41:51,011
We have plans to expand next year.
We're finding we have some space issues.

606
00:41:51,121 --> 00:41:52,884
So picture this, only bigger.

607
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:54,082
Don't touch that.

608
00:41:54,191 --> 00:41:56,250
We're the fastest-growing
Olympian industry.

609
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,954
It took a while to get up and running,
but Rome wasn't built in a day.

610
00:41:59,062 --> 00:42:00,359
Trust me, I was there.

611
00:42:00,464 --> 00:42:02,762
Excuse me, sir, we're in a bit of a hurry.

612
00:42:02,866 --> 00:42:04,595
Relax, my friend. Take it slow.

613
00:42:04,701 --> 00:42:06,965
Come on! Give me a break!

614
00:42:07,171 --> 00:42:09,833
Easy for you to say, Your Eminence.

615
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:13,874
Actually, Martha, it's not easy for him.
He's the god of freaking speed.

616
00:42:13,977 --> 00:42:18,539
Except he's not the one whose butt
is stuck to a big silver stick forever!

617
00:42:18,749 --> 00:42:21,217
Hey, guys, what did I say?

618
00:42:21,418 --> 00:42:24,581
When we meet new people,
protract your S's. It's more dramatic.

619
00:42:24,688 --> 00:42:26,121
Makes an impression.

620
00:42:26,757 --> 00:42:29,317
I'm personally insulted.
Snakes don't talk like that.

621
00:42:29,426 --> 00:42:31,690
It is a stereotype and it's offensive.

622
00:42:31,829 --> 00:42:34,127
Bad enough some of our relatives
are hanging out with Medusa...

623
00:42:34,231 --> 00:42:35,391
turning people to stone.

624
00:42:35,499 --> 00:42:36,466
All right.

625
00:42:36,567 --> 00:42:38,762
I love your hair.
I wish my hair would do that.

626
00:42:38,869 --> 00:42:40,063
Yeah, that will happen.

627
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:42,570
Why don't you guys make yourselves useful?

628
00:42:42,673 --> 00:42:44,937
Demi-Google Luke for me.
These kids are looking for him.

629
00:42:45,042 --> 00:42:46,771
- Why?
- Do they have a death wish?

630
00:42:46,877 --> 00:42:48,572
It doesn't matter. Just...

631
00:42:48,712 --> 00:42:49,804
Didn't even say "please. "

632
00:42:49,913 --> 00:42:52,211
Told you! We should have taken
that job with Hercules.

633
00:42:52,316 --> 00:42:54,045
They're an acquired taste.

634
00:42:54,685 --> 00:42:56,448
Luke. I don't know what to do about him.

635
00:42:56,553 --> 00:42:59,647
I've tried reaching out, but the kid's angry.
He's resentful.

636
00:42:59,756 --> 00:43:01,451
And he holds a grudge like nobody's business.

637
00:43:01,558 --> 00:43:03,048
Just like his mother, come to think of it.

638
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,991
Yeah, he's not my biggest fan either.

639
00:43:05,095 --> 00:43:08,963
If you're gonna cross paths or,
Zeus forbid, swords with him...

640
00:43:09,166 --> 00:43:13,068
it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world
to have a thing or two to help you out.

641
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:15,161
Collector's item, mint condition.

642
00:43:15,272 --> 00:43:17,740
<i>From Hercules Busts Heads, Season One.</i>

643
00:43:17,941 --> 00:43:19,408
<i>Hercules Busts Heads?</i>

644
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:20,975
Best TV show ever.

645
00:43:21,111 --> 00:43:24,046
So, of course, cancelled.

646
00:43:24,681 --> 00:43:26,546
Got this off Deity-Bay.

647
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:29,810
You twist the cap off this, you release the
winds from the four corners of the Earth.

648
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,047
Now, you tell me that isn't cool.

649
00:43:32,256 --> 00:43:33,814
Whoa! No, not in here!

650
00:43:34,524 --> 00:43:35,548
Not in here.

651
00:43:35,659 --> 00:43:39,026
By the gods, George was right.
You do have a death wish.

652
00:43:39,897 --> 00:43:41,330
Now, you're also...

653
00:43:42,799 --> 00:43:44,960
You're also gonna want one of these.

654
00:43:50,807 --> 00:43:52,104
Thanks.

655
00:43:52,309 --> 00:43:54,209
Mythical box sealer?

656
00:43:54,411 --> 00:43:57,107
You wound me. Truly, I am wounded.

657
00:43:57,314 --> 00:44:00,545
I hold in my hands a Matter Eliminator.
Trademark pending.

658
00:44:00,751 --> 00:44:02,378
Anything you outline with this...

659
00:44:02,486 --> 00:44:03,612
Not in here.

660
00:44:04,087 --> 00:44:05,418
...will disappear.

661
00:44:06,123 --> 00:44:07,488
Gone. Instant hole.

662
00:44:07,591 --> 00:44:08,853
"Demi-Google Luke," he said.

663
00:44:08,959 --> 00:44:11,018
Except, how am I supposed to type without fingers?

664
00:44:11,128 --> 00:44:12,652
You were supposed to use the mouse!

665
00:44:12,763 --> 00:44:14,162
I'm a snake. I eat mice.

666
00:44:14,264 --> 00:44:16,061
All right, thank you.
Have you found Luke?

667
00:44:16,166 --> 00:44:17,360
Did he just say "thank you"?

668
00:44:17,467 --> 00:44:19,025
I'm sure it was just a lapse.

669
00:44:19,136 --> 00:44:20,728
<i>Luke's on a yacht called the Andromeda.</i>

670
00:44:20,837 --> 00:44:23,237
It's passing by Chesapeake Beach as we speak.

671
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:24,329
Thank you.

672
00:44:24,441 --> 00:44:26,170
You're so welcome.

673
00:44:26,276 --> 00:44:27,607
There, you happy?

674
00:44:28,278 --> 00:44:29,245
Hush.

675
00:44:30,447 --> 00:44:31,846
Thank you very much.

676
00:44:31,949 --> 00:44:33,416
Hey, listen...

677
00:44:36,253 --> 00:44:37,811
If you see Luke...

678
00:44:38,021 --> 00:44:41,252
please explain to him for me...

679
00:44:42,326 --> 00:44:45,591
that parents, we make mistakes sometimes.

680
00:44:45,996 --> 00:44:48,829
He has every right to be angry at me.

681
00:44:49,032 --> 00:44:51,500
Just, please tell him not to be angry with the world.

682
00:44:51,601 --> 00:44:55,628
I'm not sure if there's anything
that I can say that will change him.

683
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:57,067
Try.

684
00:44:57,708 --> 00:44:59,676
If it's one thing I've learned in 3000 years...

685
00:44:59,776 --> 00:45:02,108
it's you can't give up on family.

686
00:45:09,386 --> 00:45:10,910
Thanks again.

687
00:45:12,789 --> 00:45:14,313
He'll never make it.

688
00:45:15,225 --> 00:45:16,317
That's lunch!

689
00:45:25,502 --> 00:45:27,697
That's it. That's Luke's yacht.

690
00:45:27,904 --> 00:45:29,462
What do we do? Swim?

691
00:45:29,673 --> 00:45:31,140
But it's water.

692
00:45:32,342 --> 00:45:33,809
Dad will help.

693
00:45:37,848 --> 00:45:38,815
Hey, Dad.

694
00:45:39,016 --> 00:45:42,144
We're trying to save Camp Half-Blood
and rescue a satyr named Grover.

695
00:45:42,252 --> 00:45:45,779
And we could really use your help
getting to that ship out there.

696
00:45:47,324 --> 00:45:48,518
Poseidon?

697
00:45:49,226 --> 00:45:50,193
Dad?

698
00:45:50,527 --> 00:45:51,892
It was a nice try, big guy...

699
00:45:51,995 --> 00:45:54,793
but don't be upset when he doesn't...

700
00:46:01,405 --> 00:46:02,895
...answer.

701
00:46:09,579 --> 00:46:11,444
It's a hippocampus.

702
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:24,954
Hi, girl.

703
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:28,056
Boy.

704
00:46:31,334 --> 00:46:32,596
Come here.

705
00:46:37,007 --> 00:46:39,635
Sometimes, you just gotta ask.

706
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:42,744
All I've been doing is asking.

707
00:46:58,295 --> 00:46:59,557
Are you coming?

708
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:01,497
Yeah.

709
00:47:05,202 --> 00:47:06,464
Are you ready?

710
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:07,796
Yeah.

711
00:47:08,004 --> 00:47:09,232
Giddy up!

712
00:48:15,906 --> 00:48:17,032
Back up!

713
00:48:17,674 --> 00:48:18,800
Back up.

714
00:48:29,286 --> 00:48:30,719
Thank you, friend.

715
00:48:31,054 --> 00:48:32,282
Tyson.

716
00:48:32,722 --> 00:48:34,519
Come on, buddy. We gotta go.

717
00:48:39,262 --> 00:48:40,695
You want some sugar?

718
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:52,173
- Have you seen it?
- No, man.

719
00:48:52,275 --> 00:48:53,242
Did he show it to you?

720
00:48:53,343 --> 00:48:54,537
Wait until you see it.

721
00:48:54,644 --> 00:48:56,771
It took him long enough to find it.

722
00:48:59,282 --> 00:49:02,183
That's Chris Rodriguez, Ethan Nakamura,
and Silena Beauregard.

723
00:49:02,285 --> 00:49:03,877
Luke's been recruiting.

724
00:49:06,823 --> 00:49:08,654
This is a nice boat.

725
00:49:08,858 --> 00:49:10,723
How are we gonna find Grover?

726
00:49:11,494 --> 00:49:14,657
Luke is probably keeping him below deck somewhere.

727
00:49:14,864 --> 00:49:16,195
Like, in a brig.

728
00:49:16,333 --> 00:49:18,665
I don't think yachts have brigs, Percy.

729
00:49:20,203 --> 00:49:21,602
Follow me.

730
00:49:26,309 --> 00:49:29,176
Be careful, you guys.
He said keep your distance.

731
00:49:29,713 --> 00:49:32,341
How much longer are we gonna be on this boat, anyway?

732
00:49:32,449 --> 00:49:34,349
Doesn't matter, just watch it.

733
00:49:45,028 --> 00:49:47,019
It's so time to go.

734
00:49:47,397 --> 00:49:49,490
Hey, Percy. Percy!

735
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:55,765
Tyson, do you have to make so much noise?

736
00:49:55,872 --> 00:49:57,169
Sorry!

737
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:14,757
Chris?

738
00:50:14,858 --> 00:50:15,984
Hey.

739
00:50:16,359 --> 00:50:18,293
What have you done with Grover?

740
00:50:18,928 --> 00:50:20,225
Grover?

741
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:22,857
Grover's the least of your worries.

742
00:50:24,668 --> 00:50:25,999
<i>Guess who's here.</i>

743
00:50:35,045 --> 00:50:38,640
What a surprise.
If it isn't my two favorite cousins.

744
00:50:38,848 --> 00:50:40,008
Three.

745
00:50:40,216 --> 00:50:41,979
I'm a son of Poseidon, too.

746
00:50:42,686 --> 00:50:46,452
That's funny, because Poseidon
doesn't have any other half-blood sons.

747
00:50:46,589 --> 00:50:48,318
I'm a Cyclops.

748
00:50:50,927 --> 00:50:51,985
Mist.

749
00:50:52,195 --> 00:50:53,822
You don't say.

750
00:50:57,767 --> 00:50:59,530
It's been a long time.

751
00:51:01,204 --> 00:51:03,069
You look good.

752
00:51:04,607 --> 00:51:05,938
Where's Grover?

753
00:51:06,142 --> 00:51:07,905
Grover, Grover.

754
00:51:08,111 --> 00:51:10,341
Grover, yes.
Right, the satyr.

755
00:51:10,547 --> 00:51:13,038
He should be in the Sea of Monsters right about now.

756
00:51:13,149 --> 00:51:16,710
I sent him on ahead with some friends.
We're kind of on the clock.

757
00:51:17,387 --> 00:51:18,786
Wait, you're not...

758
00:51:19,289 --> 00:51:22,156
You're not just trying to stop us
from getting the Fleece.

759
00:51:22,258 --> 00:51:23,691
I need it, too.

760
00:51:25,261 --> 00:51:28,059
I got something only the Fleece can revive.

761
00:51:28,264 --> 00:51:30,129
And it's not a tree.

762
00:51:32,268 --> 00:51:33,565
Wanna see it?

763
00:51:37,941 --> 00:51:40,205
It wasn't easy to find.

764
00:51:40,577 --> 00:51:43,705
I had to crawl through the depths of Tartarus itself.

765
00:51:44,614 --> 00:51:46,639
And then Cleveland.

766
00:51:47,484 --> 00:51:49,748
The remains of Kronos.

767
00:51:49,953 --> 00:51:52,945
The original Titan, father to the Olympians.

768
00:51:53,156 --> 00:51:56,717
And with the Fleece's help, destroyer of Olympus.

769
00:51:56,926 --> 00:51:58,393
And the world.

770
00:51:59,028 --> 00:52:02,725
You'd destroy the whole world
just to get back at your dad?

771
00:52:03,233 --> 00:52:05,758
The Olympians overthrew their parents.

772
00:52:06,302 --> 00:52:07,894
It's just our turn.

773
00:52:08,238 --> 00:52:09,671
We met your father.

774
00:52:10,039 --> 00:52:12,940
He said that he knows that he made mistakes.

775
00:52:13,143 --> 00:52:15,771
He told us to tell you to not be so angry.

776
00:52:16,179 --> 00:52:17,146
Really?

777
00:52:19,115 --> 00:52:21,345
And he couldn't even tell me himself.

778
00:52:22,018 --> 00:52:23,713
Does that sound familiar?

779
00:52:25,321 --> 00:52:26,879
Take them to the brig.

780
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:28,287
Let's go. Come on.

781
00:52:28,391 --> 00:52:31,519
Thalia was your friend!
She sacrificed herself for you.

782
00:52:32,328 --> 00:52:36,628
You're gonna lecture me about Thalia
when you're hanging around with him?

783
00:52:38,201 --> 00:52:40,499
You disappoint me the most.

784
00:53:15,238 --> 00:53:18,366
I told you he had a brig.

785
00:53:23,947 --> 00:53:25,278
How can you trust him?

786
00:53:25,381 --> 00:53:27,015
He was probably making all that noise on purpose.

787
00:53:27,116 --> 00:53:28,879
He wanted Luke to catch us.

788
00:53:29,085 --> 00:53:31,349
What do you have against Tyson anyway?

789
00:53:31,454 --> 00:53:33,046
He's a Cyclops.

790
00:53:33,256 --> 00:53:36,123
I think the politically correct term
is "ocularly impaired. "

791
00:53:36,226 --> 00:53:38,990
Who cares?
They're vicious and they're dangerous.

792
00:53:44,868 --> 00:53:47,200
Yeah, vicious.

793
00:54:07,223 --> 00:54:09,191
We have to get out of here.

794
00:54:09,392 --> 00:54:10,791
How?

795
00:54:16,833 --> 00:54:18,801
Just hang on to something.

796
00:54:49,832 --> 00:54:51,595
All right, here we go.

797
00:54:55,572 --> 00:54:57,267
Come on, come on, come on!

798
00:55:07,317 --> 00:55:08,648
What's going on?

799
00:55:14,023 --> 00:55:15,888
Percy's trying to kill us.

800
00:55:18,094 --> 00:55:19,584
I think it's working.

801
00:55:31,674 --> 00:55:32,766
You got it?

802
00:55:32,976 --> 00:55:34,967
Piece of cake.

803
00:55:35,178 --> 00:55:37,169
I think I'm gonna vomit.

804
00:55:37,814 --> 00:55:38,781
Yep.

805
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:42,418
So, how does this work?

806
00:55:42,619 --> 00:55:46,248
I don't know.
It's my first mythical tape gun.

807
00:56:05,441 --> 00:56:07,500
Just like Hermes said...

808
00:56:08,311 --> 00:56:09,573
"Instant hole. "

809
00:56:39,642 --> 00:56:41,132
Go to the lifeboat.

810
00:56:51,387 --> 00:56:53,082
Kill the engines.

811
00:56:58,628 --> 00:57:00,596
That was for Grover.

812
00:57:11,174 --> 00:57:12,641
Grab him!

813
00:57:36,332 --> 00:57:37,663
We got him!

814
00:57:46,242 --> 00:57:47,675
What are you doing?

815
00:57:48,277 --> 00:57:49,835
Don't walk on my roof.

816
00:57:55,685 --> 00:57:57,312
Join me, Percy.

817
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:01,183
It's what you were meant to do.
You can't escape that prophecy.

818
00:58:02,125 --> 00:58:04,093
Let's show both of our fathers.

819
00:58:04,694 --> 00:58:06,093
It's tempting.

820
00:58:10,633 --> 00:58:13,067
That's genius. Really.

821
00:58:13,803 --> 00:58:15,361
But I think I'll pass.

822
00:58:32,121 --> 00:58:33,713
Not this again.

823
00:58:36,192 --> 00:58:37,159
Go!

824
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:39,751
- Are you staying?
- I'll be right behind you.

825
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,297
May as well.

826
00:59:20,036 --> 00:59:21,435
Jackson, enough.

827
00:59:26,042 --> 00:59:28,237
You're on the losing side.

828
00:59:28,945 --> 00:59:30,640
Not from where I stand.

829
00:59:48,698 --> 00:59:50,188
Smart.

830
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:53,129
Goddess of wisdom's daughter, remember?

831
00:59:54,003 --> 00:59:55,595
I remember.

832
01:00:03,846 --> 01:00:07,714
Our allies and the satyr still have
a head start on the Fleece.

833
01:00:09,352 --> 01:00:11,718
We will resurrect you, Lord Kronos.

834
01:00:12,488 --> 01:00:14,513
You will know vengeance.

835
01:00:15,825 --> 01:00:19,283
And the Olympians who scorned us will know death.

836
01:00:38,447 --> 01:00:40,847
Maybe you should reapply.

837
01:00:43,252 --> 01:00:44,549
It wore off?

838
01:00:46,122 --> 01:00:47,089
Yeah.

839
01:01:00,369 --> 01:01:01,563
Come on.

840
01:01:03,406 --> 01:01:04,668
Oh, no.

841
01:01:10,413 --> 01:01:11,402
Hey.

842
01:01:12,281 --> 01:01:14,340
Do you want to steer for a while?

843
01:01:16,585 --> 01:01:17,882
Thank you.

844
01:01:19,355 --> 01:01:21,846
Nobody's ever trusted me with anything before.

845
01:01:21,958 --> 01:01:24,927
Is that because of your lack of depth perception?

846
01:01:26,329 --> 01:01:28,490
Is it because they're scared of you?

847
01:01:32,501 --> 01:01:34,594
I was in the mountains one day...

848
01:01:35,338 --> 01:01:40,332
and some campers, Boy Scouts, showed up.

849
01:01:43,112 --> 01:01:46,741
And when they saw me, they screamed.

850
01:01:48,317 --> 01:01:49,784
They ran.

851
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,818
And I'm pretty sure I smiled.

852
01:01:56,625 --> 01:01:59,492
People look at me, and they see a monster.

853
01:02:00,229 --> 01:02:02,561
Sometimes, I think maybe they're right.

854
01:02:05,201 --> 01:02:08,830
You're not a monster.
Don't be so hard on yourself.

855
01:02:11,307 --> 01:02:12,774
Easy for you to say.

856
01:02:12,975 --> 01:02:14,272
What do you mean?

857
01:02:14,377 --> 01:02:17,710
You never doubt yourself
or think you're less than you are.

858
01:02:21,717 --> 01:02:23,810
Thank you, brother.

859
01:02:24,353 --> 01:02:27,049
Come here. Open it slowly.

860
01:02:27,256 --> 01:02:28,450
Slowly.

861
01:02:30,326 --> 01:02:34,285
Hey, just take it slow. Slow, okay?

862
01:02:40,536 --> 01:02:43,403
I wouldn't have trusted him with a normal thermos.

863
01:02:43,873 --> 01:02:45,807
He seems okay.

864
01:02:46,008 --> 01:02:48,772
I really don't get what your problem with him is.

865
01:02:51,547 --> 01:02:54,141
Because you don't know what I know about them.

866
01:02:54,717 --> 01:02:55,809
Thalia!

867
01:03:03,426 --> 01:03:05,690
A Cyclops killed her.

868
01:03:07,029 --> 01:03:09,327
His kind killed Thalia.

869
01:03:10,866 --> 01:03:12,333
I'm sorry.

870
01:03:13,769 --> 01:03:15,236
I never knew.

871
01:03:15,438 --> 01:03:17,998
Well, it's not something I like talking about.

872
01:03:19,141 --> 01:03:21,735
And anyway, it was a long time ago.

873
01:03:31,587 --> 01:03:32,918
What is that?

874
01:03:34,123 --> 01:03:35,852
It's the Sea of Monsters.

875
01:03:42,298 --> 01:03:43,856
Why are we stopping?

876
01:03:47,503 --> 01:03:49,368
I should have used two hands.

877
01:03:49,472 --> 01:03:50,803
You think?

878
01:03:51,841 --> 01:03:53,138
Are you mad at me?

879
01:03:53,242 --> 01:03:55,142
No, not at you.

880
01:04:12,361 --> 01:04:14,158
Tell me those aren't sharks.

881
01:04:17,333 --> 01:04:18,994
Those aren't sharks.

882
01:04:19,935 --> 01:04:22,062
Paddle! Paddle!

883
01:04:27,176 --> 01:04:29,041
Yeah, sharks would be better.

884
01:04:43,626 --> 01:04:45,423
It's Charybdis.

885
01:04:45,628 --> 01:04:46,890
Charyb... What?

886
01:04:46,996 --> 01:04:48,964
She guards the Sea of Monsters.

887
01:04:54,870 --> 01:04:55,996
Percy!

888
01:05:03,479 --> 01:05:05,003
It's not working!

889
01:05:05,981 --> 01:05:08,973
The Sea of Monsters might not be in Poseidon's domain.

890
01:05:12,555 --> 01:05:13,522
Hold on!

891
01:05:52,795 --> 01:05:54,319
Where are we?

892
01:05:56,632 --> 01:05:58,293
Smells like the stomach.

893
01:06:08,744 --> 01:06:10,609
Watch your step.

894
01:06:16,785 --> 01:06:18,412
What is this stuff?

895
01:06:19,221 --> 01:06:21,189
I don't think you want to know.

896
01:06:22,124 --> 01:06:24,592
This has to be the worst way to die, ever.

897
01:06:24,793 --> 01:06:28,524
Yeah, everything that disappears
in the Bermuda Triangle...

898
01:06:28,731 --> 01:06:30,790
this is where they end up.

899
01:06:31,667 --> 01:06:33,134
Come on!

900
01:06:34,136 --> 01:06:35,569
That sounded like Clarisse.

901
01:06:35,671 --> 01:06:37,434
No, it couldn't be her.

902
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:40,404
You ridiculously stupid morons.

903
01:06:40,609 --> 01:06:42,474
- No, it's her.
- It's her.

904
01:06:47,082 --> 01:06:48,049
You idiot!

905
01:06:48,150 --> 01:06:51,415
Better keep my electric grid up
and running, or I'll plug your head into it!

906
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:53,420
Clarisse! Hey!

907
01:06:56,258 --> 01:06:59,284
Jackson? What are you doing here?

908
01:06:59,495 --> 01:07:01,588
We got swallowed up, just like you.

909
01:07:01,797 --> 01:07:02,855
Nice ship.

910
01:07:02,965 --> 01:07:06,059
My dad's got tons of this stuff
left over from wars throughout history.

911
01:07:06,168 --> 01:07:10,628
It was either this or a Huey from Vietnam.
I figured a boat would be more practical.

912
01:07:13,208 --> 01:07:14,505
What's going on?

913
01:07:14,610 --> 01:07:18,046
Pretty much exactly what you think
goes on inside of a stomach.

914
01:07:31,293 --> 01:07:32,624
You're right.

915
01:07:32,828 --> 01:07:34,728
That really is the worst way to die.

916
01:07:34,830 --> 01:07:35,819
Reardon!

917
01:07:35,931 --> 01:07:38,399
What in Hades is going on with my engine?
Is it ready yet?

918
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:41,367
Almost, ma'am. They're working on it.

919
01:07:41,570 --> 01:07:44,164
Wait, your crew is zombies?

920
01:07:46,709 --> 01:07:48,404
They prefer "dead Confederate sailors

921
01:07:48,510 --> 01:07:50,444
whose lives have been given
in tribute to Ares. "

922
01:07:50,546 --> 01:07:52,980
But "zombies" is fine.

923
01:08:07,830 --> 01:08:10,355
Reardon! Gun! Faster! Now!

924
01:08:10,566 --> 01:08:12,500
Gun is hot, Cap'n. Locked and loaded.

925
01:08:12,601 --> 01:08:14,569
Aim it at that meat grinder.

926
01:08:14,770 --> 01:08:17,000
Wait, wait.
You want to shoot that thing with this?

927
01:08:17,106 --> 01:08:20,234
Do you have a better idea?
Because now would be the time.

928
01:08:23,746 --> 01:08:25,008
Hey, Clarisse.

929
01:08:25,781 --> 01:08:26,805
What?

930
01:08:27,015 --> 01:08:28,243
Can you steer the ship?

931
01:08:28,350 --> 01:08:31,148
No. I just finished driver's ed.
Yes, of course, I can steer a ship.

932
01:08:31,253 --> 01:08:32,652
Well...

933
01:08:33,122 --> 01:08:34,612
why don't we give her a stomach ache?

934
01:08:34,723 --> 01:08:36,588
We'll escape through the gut.

935
01:08:37,192 --> 01:08:39,126
It just might work if it doesn't kill us first.

936
01:08:39,228 --> 01:08:41,526
You steer, I'll shoot.

937
01:08:42,631 --> 01:08:44,258
All hands below deck!

938
01:08:46,702 --> 01:08:48,397
Good luck, Percy.

939
01:08:53,308 --> 01:08:55,742
All hands below deck.
This is not a drill!

940
01:08:55,878 --> 01:08:57,846
Come on, boys. Get in there.

941
01:09:02,151 --> 01:09:03,743
This is still my quest.

942
01:09:03,952 --> 01:09:06,182
Do not screw this up for me, Jackson.

943
01:09:25,841 --> 01:09:27,741
You should watch what you eat.

944
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:44,726
Go!

945
01:09:44,927 --> 01:09:46,485
No kidding, genius.

946
01:09:58,674 --> 01:10:00,471
I hope this works.

947
01:10:02,711 --> 01:10:05,077
- Just don't forget.
- Forget what?

948
01:10:07,616 --> 01:10:09,607
This is all your idea.

949
01:10:24,777 --> 01:10:26,142
Come on, come on.

950
01:10:38,958 --> 01:10:41,119
- We did it!
- I did it!

951
01:10:42,695 --> 01:10:44,822
Listen up. Full power to the screws.

952
01:10:45,031 --> 01:10:46,362
Hey, are you guys all right?

953
01:10:46,465 --> 01:10:47,796
That was amazing.

954
01:10:51,904 --> 01:10:53,462
You have to have faith, right?

955
01:10:53,573 --> 01:10:56,041
And a cannon. We'll find Grover.

956
01:10:57,977 --> 01:10:59,376
Where is Ichneutae?

957
01:10:59,478 --> 01:11:01,036
Now you miss Ichneutae?

958
01:11:01,147 --> 01:11:04,173
We ran into Scylla,
that multi-headed Hydra thing.

959
01:11:04,383 --> 01:11:05,975
He said, "I got this. "

960
01:11:06,185 --> 01:11:07,618
Famous last words.

961
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:09,845
We've restored full power, Cap'n.

962
01:11:10,256 --> 01:11:11,951
- Heading?
- Northwest.

963
01:11:19,832 --> 01:11:21,459
Are you sure about that?

964
01:11:21,567 --> 01:11:24,866
Yes, I'm sure about that.
Why, do you have a problem?

965
01:11:25,071 --> 01:11:26,732
Yeah, you got a problem?

966
01:11:28,174 --> 01:11:33,840
I think your Confederate warship
is heading to West Palm Beach, Florida.

967
01:11:35,114 --> 01:11:36,081
What is it?

968
01:11:36,182 --> 01:11:39,674
I know this sounds insane,
but it's kind of like my dyslexia.

969
01:11:39,885 --> 01:11:44,049
But instead of being able to read Greek,
I can see map lines.

970
01:11:44,423 --> 01:11:47,324
30, 31, 75, 12.

971
01:11:48,761 --> 01:11:51,059
Wait, that's the numbers from the...

972
01:11:51,264 --> 01:11:54,893
From the crazy, eyeless taxi drivers.

973
01:11:55,101 --> 01:11:56,568
They're coordinates.

974
01:11:57,036 --> 01:11:58,469
Waterboy figured it out.

975
01:11:58,571 --> 01:11:59,697
And he called you crazy.

976
01:11:59,805 --> 01:12:00,965
Actually, he called you crazy.

977
01:12:01,073 --> 01:12:02,870
Hey, eye on the road.

978
01:12:03,442 --> 01:12:05,501
30, 31 degrees north...

979
01:12:06,078 --> 01:12:08,171
75, 12 degrees west.

980
01:12:08,381 --> 01:12:10,815
That's where Polyphemus and the Fleece are.

981
01:12:10,916 --> 01:12:13,248
Change course. Southwest.

982
01:12:13,452 --> 01:12:14,783
Aye, aye.

983
01:12:15,154 --> 01:12:16,382
Sorry.

984
01:12:39,245 --> 01:12:40,712
Land ho!

985
01:12:44,483 --> 01:12:47,111
Polyphemus lives in an amusement park?

986
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:49,083
No, he lives on an island.

987
01:12:49,288 --> 01:12:50,755
But the goddess Circe thought building

988
01:12:50,856 --> 01:12:53,347
an amusement park on top of it was a good idea.

989
01:12:53,459 --> 01:12:54,687
It really wasn't.

990
01:12:54,794 --> 01:12:56,022
What happened?

991
01:12:56,629 --> 01:12:57,857
Opening day...

992
01:12:57,963 --> 01:13:02,127
long lines of savory half-bloods
and one hungry Cyclops.

993
01:13:02,968 --> 01:13:04,333
Bad for business.

994
01:13:05,104 --> 01:13:06,901
I'll just turn us right around then.

995
01:13:07,006 --> 01:13:08,906
Find us a place to dock.

996
01:13:10,176 --> 01:13:12,337
I was afraid she was gonna say that.

997
01:13:31,130 --> 01:13:34,099
I guess the Cyclops was bad for business.

998
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:35,494
Who knew?

999
01:13:37,636 --> 01:13:40,503
We don't have time to search this whole place.

1000
01:13:42,875 --> 01:13:44,536
I don't think we have to.

1001
01:13:46,979 --> 01:13:49,174
"Plummet of Death"?

1002
01:13:49,982 --> 01:13:51,449
That's subtle.

1003
01:13:52,251 --> 01:13:55,243
It looks like something really big went through there.

1004
01:13:56,489 --> 01:13:59,515
I don't know.
It doesn't really scream "Cyclops" to me.

1005
01:14:03,763 --> 01:14:05,594
At least there's no line.

1006
01:14:11,504 --> 01:14:13,062
Sweet ride.

1007
01:14:16,175 --> 01:14:17,540
Might need a push.

1008
01:14:24,450 --> 01:14:25,940
Here we go.

1009
01:14:28,087 --> 01:14:30,180
Tyson? Let go of my hand.

1010
01:14:30,389 --> 01:14:31,515
Sorry.

1011
01:14:33,993 --> 01:14:37,724
<i>It's a small world after all</i>

1012
01:14:37,930 --> 01:14:41,366
<i>It's a small world after all</i>

1013
01:14:41,567 --> 01:14:43,899
Could you two just shut up?

1014
01:14:48,007 --> 01:14:48,974
Hold on!

1015
01:14:51,510 --> 01:14:52,841
Is everybody okay?

1016
01:14:52,945 --> 01:14:55,004
I thought that would be more fun.

1017
01:15:00,586 --> 01:15:03,282
I think I get what Grover was so worried about.

1018
01:15:04,957 --> 01:15:07,255
This must be the boulder
Polyphemus used to trap Odysseus...

1019
01:15:07,359 --> 01:15:09,884
when he was returning from the Trojan War.

1020
01:15:10,496 --> 01:15:12,657
Yeah, that's right. I know stuff.

1021
01:15:28,647 --> 01:15:29,841
Grover!

1022
01:15:32,117 --> 01:15:33,641
Enough!

1023
01:15:35,354 --> 01:15:37,447
I can't take this anymore.

1024
01:15:45,798 --> 01:15:47,197
It's been two days!

1025
01:15:47,299 --> 01:15:49,631
Calm your temper!
Calm your temper!

1026
01:15:50,503 --> 01:15:54,098
I haven't had a decent meal
since those half-bloods you brought!

1027
01:15:54,306 --> 01:15:57,036
And this stupid fleece is supposed to lure satyrs!

1028
01:15:57,142 --> 01:15:59,235
Do you see any satyrs around here?

1029
01:16:00,646 --> 01:16:03,581
This hunger is making my eyesight worse.

1030
01:16:03,782 --> 01:16:05,477
I could just eat you.

1031
01:16:07,853 --> 01:16:10,583
If you weren't a Cyclops.

1032
01:16:12,825 --> 01:16:13,792
Grover!

1033
01:16:15,127 --> 01:16:16,094
Grover!

1034
01:16:16,629 --> 01:16:17,687
- Hey!
- Come here!

1035
01:16:17,796 --> 01:16:18,763
Percy?

1036
01:16:21,333 --> 01:16:22,300
Hey!

1037
01:16:24,203 --> 01:16:25,932
Why are you wearing a dress?

1038
01:16:26,038 --> 01:16:28,302
I'm having a really bad day!

1039
01:16:28,507 --> 01:16:30,839
Hey, hey, hey!
Do not let that go viral!

1040
01:16:31,043 --> 01:16:33,443
Sorry, there's no way the other kids
would believe me otherwise.

1041
01:16:33,546 --> 01:16:34,945
This is a disguise.

1042
01:16:35,047 --> 01:16:37,607
The guy's half-blind.
He thinks I'm a Cyclops chambermaid.

1043
01:16:37,716 --> 01:16:39,240
I'm showing mad survival skills, here.

1044
01:16:39,351 --> 01:16:40,750
And not a small amount of leg.

1045
01:16:40,853 --> 01:16:41,820
Funny.

1046
01:16:41,921 --> 01:16:45,379
I was trying to stay uneaten long enough to
figure out how to get the Fleece off of him.

1047
01:16:45,491 --> 01:16:46,856
So, did you?

1048
01:16:47,593 --> 01:16:49,959
Do you think I'd still be dressed like this if I did?

1049
01:16:50,062 --> 01:16:51,689
It's a good look.

1050
01:16:51,897 --> 01:16:52,886
Thanks, Tyson.

1051
01:16:54,767 --> 01:17:00,103
Clopsies, how about I cook you something to drink...

1052
01:17:00,306 --> 01:17:02,171
to calm your nerves?

1053
01:17:04,243 --> 01:17:06,302
I don't know what to do anymore.

1054
01:17:07,146 --> 01:17:08,443
Go! Go!

1055
01:17:08,647 --> 01:17:11,377
This fleece used to lure satyrs every day.

1056
01:17:14,253 --> 01:17:17,984
Now things are so bad, I even had to eat my own sheep.

1057
01:17:18,757 --> 01:17:20,190
The whole flock!

1058
01:17:21,393 --> 01:17:23,088
They were tender, though.

1059
01:17:24,597 --> 01:17:27,623
Drop me, and I promise you'll never hear the end of it.

1060
01:17:30,703 --> 01:17:32,295
Do you smell something?

1061
01:17:32,671 --> 01:17:34,901
Smells like half-bloods!

1062
01:17:40,112 --> 01:17:41,101
Half-bloods!

1063
01:17:41,213 --> 01:17:42,976
- Get up, quick!
- I was right!

1064
01:17:43,082 --> 01:17:44,572
You stay right there!

1065
01:17:44,683 --> 01:17:46,344
Woman, get a fire going!

1066
01:17:46,552 --> 01:17:47,814
That's not good!

1067
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:49,353
On second thought...

1068
01:17:50,089 --> 01:17:52,023
I'll just eat you raw!

1069
01:17:52,224 --> 01:17:53,191
Hey!

1070
01:17:55,427 --> 01:17:56,894
Hiya!

1071
01:17:57,096 --> 01:17:58,961
My name's Tyson. How are you?

1072
01:17:59,365 --> 01:18:01,162
These guys are my friends...

1073
01:18:01,467 --> 01:18:03,298
so I was hoping, maybe, we could talk.

1074
01:18:03,402 --> 01:18:05,768
You know, Cyclops to Cyclops.

1075
01:18:05,971 --> 01:18:07,871
You pissant with one eye!

1076
01:18:08,073 --> 01:18:09,563
Hey! Not nice!

1077
01:18:09,775 --> 01:18:11,538
You're no Cyclops!

1078
01:18:11,744 --> 01:18:14,042
You're a traitor to your kind!

1079
01:18:14,246 --> 01:18:15,508
To be honest...

1080
01:18:16,715 --> 01:18:17,841
Huh? What?

1081
01:18:18,784 --> 01:18:19,978
He's my kind.

1082
01:18:20,085 --> 01:18:22,019
You disgust me.

1083
01:18:27,459 --> 01:18:28,790
Going somewhere?

1084
01:18:33,265 --> 01:18:35,927
I think you've got something of mine.

1085
01:18:36,935 --> 01:18:38,095
Annabeth!

1086
01:18:43,509 --> 01:18:44,703
Clarisse!

1087
01:18:56,522 --> 01:18:58,285
Get back here, you punk!

1088
01:18:58,490 --> 01:18:59,889
Yo, Clopsies!

1089
01:19:01,994 --> 01:19:03,655
I quit!

1090
01:19:04,663 --> 01:19:06,824
Wait, you're a dude?

1091
01:19:07,032 --> 01:19:08,727
Well, that explains a lot.

1092
01:19:09,134 --> 01:19:11,568
- Say goodbye.
- Okay. Goodbye!

1093
01:19:11,770 --> 01:19:14,967
You deceitful little brats!
I'll tear off your flesh!

1094
01:19:15,474 --> 01:19:17,567
Come on! Go, go!

1095
01:19:18,277 --> 01:19:19,767
Give me that fleece!

1096
01:19:29,288 --> 01:19:30,414
You're dead!

1097
01:19:30,556 --> 01:19:32,251
I'm gonna kill all of you!

1098
01:19:32,624 --> 01:19:34,455
Do you hear me?

1099
01:19:37,896 --> 01:19:39,523
Get back here!

1100
01:19:45,804 --> 01:19:47,237
We rocked that quest.

1101
01:19:47,339 --> 01:19:48,966
Yeah, we totally did.

1102
01:19:49,174 --> 01:19:51,404
I didn't know you guys had it in you!

1103
01:19:51,744 --> 01:19:52,802
Yes.

1104
01:19:53,245 --> 01:19:54,507
Well done.

1105
01:19:58,350 --> 01:20:00,682
It's nice work. I really appreciate it.

1106
01:20:02,454 --> 01:20:03,716
I'll take that.

1107
01:20:07,559 --> 01:20:08,890
I don't think so.

1108
01:20:10,596 --> 01:20:11,824
Suit yourself.

1109
01:20:28,981 --> 01:20:30,676
You'd do it for me.

1110
01:20:32,251 --> 01:20:33,445
No!

1111
01:20:57,609 --> 01:20:59,577
Just remember...

1112
01:20:59,778 --> 01:21:01,769
it didn't have to end this way.

1113
01:21:03,148 --> 01:21:04,979
This one's on you.

1114
01:21:11,423 --> 01:21:12,720
Down, boy!

1115
01:21:20,165 --> 01:21:22,395
You should consider yourselves lucky.

1116
01:21:23,001 --> 01:21:25,299
This has been millennia in the making.

1117
01:21:26,138 --> 01:21:27,901
And you all get to see it.

1118
01:21:28,540 --> 01:21:30,508
You used to be one of us!

1119
01:21:32,344 --> 01:21:33,971
And then I woke up.

1120
01:21:38,650 --> 01:21:42,313
Percy, if Kronos comes back, that's it.
Game over.

1121
01:21:44,489 --> 01:21:45,751
Percy.

1122
01:21:47,326 --> 01:21:49,191
I never called him "brother. "

1123
01:21:51,230 --> 01:21:53,630
All he ever wanted was a brother...

1124
01:21:54,967 --> 01:21:57,527
but I was too wrapped up in myself.

1125
01:21:59,471 --> 01:22:02,099
And now Luke has the Fleece...

1126
01:22:02,307 --> 01:22:04,434
because I gave it to him.

1127
01:22:06,144 --> 01:22:10,342
I destroy Olympus, just like the Oracle said.

1128
01:22:12,384 --> 01:22:13,749
Forget the Oracle.

1129
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:18,514
You're worried about your destiny?
Then write a new one.

1130
01:22:19,591 --> 01:22:23,584
You're angry at Poseidon for ignoring you?
Then show him why he shouldn't.

1131
01:22:24,129 --> 01:22:26,097
You're upset about Tyson?

1132
01:22:27,733 --> 01:22:29,701
Then make sure he didn't die for nothing.

1133
01:22:29,801 --> 01:22:31,496
She's right.

1134
01:22:34,039 --> 01:22:35,165
What?

1135
01:22:35,374 --> 01:22:38,070
There's no way you're getting me to repeat that.

1136
01:22:39,611 --> 01:22:41,636
What Annabeth is saying, Perce...

1137
01:22:41,747 --> 01:22:44,011
is that we're with you.

1138
01:22:44,216 --> 01:22:45,911
Just give the word.

1139
01:22:46,318 --> 01:22:47,717
Why me?

1140
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:50,117
I mean, who voted me leader?

1141
01:23:03,902 --> 01:23:07,804
Lord Kronos, he who was betrayed by his sons...

1142
01:23:08,006 --> 01:23:10,907
hear now the words of one betrayed by his father.

1143
01:23:11,109 --> 01:23:13,703
I bid you... rise.

1144
01:23:52,451 --> 01:23:53,418
Grover!

1145
01:23:55,220 --> 01:23:56,187
Hands.

1146
01:23:56,688 --> 01:23:59,919
Try not to cut them off.
I'm pretty attached to them.

1147
01:24:19,344 --> 01:24:21,244
I have to get to the Fleece.

1148
01:24:21,446 --> 01:24:23,414
So, what are we supposed to do?

1149
01:24:25,384 --> 01:24:26,749
Right.

1150
01:24:55,347 --> 01:24:57,838
I know you can breathe under water, Jackson.

1151
01:24:57,983 --> 01:24:59,883
But can you breathe like this?

1152
01:25:10,395 --> 01:25:11,521
Hi, Brother!

1153
01:25:25,110 --> 01:25:26,134
What the...?

1154
01:25:26,244 --> 01:25:27,404
The water.

1155
01:25:28,947 --> 01:25:30,380
It healed me.

1156
01:25:32,517 --> 01:25:34,348
Son of Poseidon.

1157
01:25:39,257 --> 01:25:40,519
Thank you...

1158
01:25:42,227 --> 01:25:43,592
Brother.

1159
01:26:07,619 --> 01:26:08,916
He rises.

1160
01:26:26,271 --> 01:26:27,533
Master!

1161
01:26:27,739 --> 01:26:29,331
I brought you back!

1162
01:26:38,483 --> 01:26:40,246
My Lord!

1163
01:26:40,452 --> 01:26:41,510
It's Luke!

1164
01:26:42,087 --> 01:26:43,577
Luke Castellan!

1165
01:26:44,322 --> 01:26:46,415
Your great-grandson!

1166
01:26:47,659 --> 01:26:49,251
My favorite.

1167
01:27:36,107 --> 01:27:37,267
Grover!

1168
01:28:12,711 --> 01:28:14,576
It's the cursed blade!

1169
01:28:16,281 --> 01:28:18,146
"... cursed blade shall reap. "

1170
01:28:45,377 --> 01:28:47,811
You want to know who gave me this sword?

1171
01:28:48,913 --> 01:28:51,905
The god that killed you with it in the first place!

1172
01:28:55,220 --> 01:28:56,551
My father.

1173
01:28:57,722 --> 01:28:59,246
Percy Jackson...

1174
01:28:59,457 --> 01:29:02,051
your destiny was written long ago.

1175
01:29:04,429 --> 01:29:05,487
No!

1176
01:29:08,733 --> 01:29:10,860
I make my own destiny.

1177
01:29:47,472 --> 01:29:48,632
Half-blood!

1178
01:29:49,607 --> 01:29:51,973
Just in time for dinner.

1179
01:30:16,768 --> 01:30:17,962
Thanks, Dad.

1180
01:30:20,605 --> 01:30:21,902
Percy.

1181
01:30:29,681 --> 01:30:31,012
Annabeth!

1182
01:30:34,552 --> 01:30:35,519
Grover!

1183
01:30:58,910 --> 01:31:00,036
Annabeth!

1184
01:31:02,881 --> 01:31:04,109
No, no!

1185
01:31:04,482 --> 01:31:07,110
At least I'll be with Thalia in Elysium.

1186
01:31:07,585 --> 01:31:09,485
Come here. Give me the Fleece!

1187
01:31:09,754 --> 01:31:11,085
Come on! Come on.

1188
01:31:11,256 --> 01:31:12,223
Come on.

1189
01:31:14,426 --> 01:31:18,328
We make our own destinies, right?
So show me.

1190
01:31:18,530 --> 01:31:19,997
I have faith in you.

1191
01:31:23,568 --> 01:31:26,401
No, no. Come on, show me.

1192
01:31:27,338 --> 01:31:28,566
Show me.

1193
01:31:30,241 --> 01:31:31,538
Come on.

1194
01:32:07,245 --> 01:32:08,269
Annie.

1195
01:32:13,818 --> 01:32:15,115
What happened?

1196
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:17,012
Don't worry about it.

1197
01:32:17,121 --> 01:32:19,521
If anyone else wants to die tonight...

1198
01:32:19,724 --> 01:32:21,749
at least we have this.

1199
01:32:23,394 --> 01:32:25,760
Hey. You're alive.

1200
01:32:26,631 --> 01:32:28,030
Yeah.

1201
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:31,098
What you did for Percy...

1202
01:32:32,670 --> 01:32:34,934
that was not so vicious and dangerous.

1203
01:32:37,275 --> 01:32:38,742
Thanks.

1204
01:32:39,511 --> 01:32:40,478
No.

1205
01:32:41,145 --> 01:32:42,407
Thank you.

1206
01:32:53,658 --> 01:32:54,625
You know what, Tyson?

1207
01:32:54,726 --> 01:32:57,388
I know a lot of campers with two eyes
who couldn't do what you did.

1208
01:32:57,495 --> 01:32:59,520
- Hey, Clarisse.
- What?

1209
01:32:59,731 --> 01:33:02,131
Come on, big guy.
We get back to camp, the nectar's on me.

1210
01:33:02,233 --> 01:33:03,894
Have you met the nymphs?

1211
01:33:04,636 --> 01:33:06,103
This was your quest.

1212
01:33:07,171 --> 01:33:10,766
I couldn't have done it without you.

1213
01:33:10,975 --> 01:33:13,170
I think you should be the one who gets to...

1214
01:33:13,278 --> 01:33:14,939
...do the honors.

1215
01:33:31,296 --> 01:33:33,389
Here you go, Thalia.

1216
01:34:46,304 --> 01:34:49,865
Clarisse! Clarisse! Clarisse!

1217
01:34:55,513 --> 01:34:56,775
Nectar?

1218
01:34:58,783 --> 01:34:59,807
If you haven't had...

1219
01:34:59,917 --> 01:35:01,407
...you haven't lived.

1220
01:35:06,624 --> 01:35:07,852
You know what?

1221
01:35:09,260 --> 01:35:11,285
You don't need these anymore.

1222
01:35:12,930 --> 01:35:14,420
There, that's better.

1223
01:35:28,980 --> 01:35:30,242
<i>You seem happy.</i>

1224
01:35:30,782 --> 01:35:34,479
I'm just relieved to have that whole
prophecy thing off my shoulders.

1225
01:35:34,686 --> 01:35:37,280
I'm not altogether sure it is, Percy.

1226
01:35:37,488 --> 01:35:41,549
You've done wonderfully, but you are
still the only living human child...

1227
01:35:41,759 --> 01:35:44,023
of Poseidon, Hades, or Zeus.

1228
01:35:44,228 --> 01:35:45,627
Besides...

1229
01:35:45,830 --> 01:35:48,094
it's quite possible the Oracle wasn't referring

1230
01:35:48,199 --> 01:35:50,861
to what would unfold on Polyphemus' island.

1231
01:35:51,069 --> 01:35:53,970
I'm just saying, a lot can happen
between now and your 20th birthday.

1232
01:35:54,072 --> 01:35:56,040
That's not really what I meant.

1233
01:35:56,174 --> 01:35:59,803
What I meant was finding out you have a destiny...

1234
01:36:00,011 --> 01:36:03,572
is a lot like finding out you have
a half-brother who's a Cyclops.

1235
01:36:03,981 --> 01:36:06,211
It might not be as bad as you think.

1236
01:36:19,163 --> 01:36:21,757
Percy! Percy!

1237
01:36:22,900 --> 01:36:24,197
Percy!

1238
01:36:24,569 --> 01:36:27,333
Annabeth was guarding the tree last night...

1239
01:36:27,538 --> 01:36:29,130
and something happened.

1240
01:36:31,309 --> 01:36:32,367
Percy.

1241
01:36:33,010 --> 01:36:34,637
- The Fleece!
- What happened?

1242
01:36:34,746 --> 01:36:37,306
It was even more powerful than we thought.

1243
01:36:57,034 --> 01:36:58,399
Come on, help her.

1244
01:37:00,238 --> 01:37:01,398
Who are you?

1245
01:37:02,406 --> 01:37:04,738
Percy.
Everything's all right, it's okay.

1246
01:37:05,176 --> 01:37:06,609
I had the strangest dream.

1247
01:37:06,711 --> 01:37:07,678
Yeah?

1248
01:37:07,779 --> 01:37:09,644
Like I was dying.

1249
01:37:10,047 --> 01:37:11,378
What's your name?

1250
01:37:12,517 --> 01:37:15,645
I'm Thalia, daughter of Zeus.

1251
01:37:18,389 --> 01:37:21,358
<i>Another living child of the eldest gods.</i>

1252
01:37:24,228 --> 01:37:26,423
<i>Maybe it wasn't me.</i>

1253
01:37:26,631 --> 01:37:29,429
<i>Maybe the Oracle meant Thalia all along.</i>

1254
01:37:30,902 --> 01:37:33,234
<i>Could she be our salvation?</i>

1255
01:37:33,638 --> 01:37:36,038
<i>Or the cause of our destruction?</i>

1256
01:37:37,305 --> 01:38:37,588
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
