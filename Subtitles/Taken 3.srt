00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,410
Honey?
Hmm?

3
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,806
Have you seen my checkbook?

4
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,689
Downstairs
in the living room.

5
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,162
Shh.

6
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,210
Darling, are you okay?

7
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,761
Fine!

8
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,604
Are you sure?

9
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,526
I'm just gonna take
the dog for a walk.

10
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,410
Okay.

11
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,290
Nice office.

12
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,441
Nice family.

13
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,601
Sorry to disturb you
at this time of night...

14
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,444
but we have a little problem.

15
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,242
Your boss owes me money.

16
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,209
A lot of money.

17
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,124
And I'm here to collect it.

18
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,521
I'm just the accountant.
I don't know anything.

19
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,449
You don't need to
know anything...

20
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,489
except the combination
to the safe.

21
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,210
You do know
the combination, yes?

22
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,121
Yes.

23
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,089
Perfect. Please.

24
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,920
Get in.
Ah.

25
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,763
<i>This is 310-555-0199.
Leave a message.</i>

26
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,605
Hello, my friend.
It's Malankov.

27
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,607
I came to your office
to collect my money.

28
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,764
What a disappointment
to see it's not here.

29
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,483
But I am leaving you
something here in return.

30
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,481
As a reminder.

31
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,881
I cannot wait any longer.

32
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,331
My best to the family.

33
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,967
Sweet.

34
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,246
Yeah.

35
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,890
How old?

36
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,369
No matter how old
they are, my friend...

37
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,640
they will always
be our baby.

38
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,610
Ain't that true?
Come on, big guy.

39
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,687
Thank you.

40
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,404
- Whoa!
- Happy birthday!

41
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,366
Dad!

42
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,890
My birthday's
not even for three days.

43
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,690
You're always saying
I'm so predictable.

44
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,569
I wanted to shake
things up a bit,

45
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,483
make it a little
less predictable.

46
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,520
Sorry.

47
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,721
Come in.

48
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,242
- Champagne glasses?
- You know me.

49
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,211
Why would I have
champagne glasses?

50
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,121
Or a giant stuffed panda?

51
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,327
I heard that.

52
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,242
Inappropriate, huh?
Well, I mean...

53
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,887
not if I was 7.
I can return it...

54
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,121
or you can hang on to it

55
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,760
until you have
a 7-year-old of your own.

56
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,085
Not funny.

57
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,771
Hey, baby. Babe?
Hey!

58
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,002
Hey, look who's here.
Mr. Mills.

59
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,561
Hello, Jimy.

60
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,724
How are you?
Good. You?

61
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,721
You know. Hey.

62
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,961
Hi.

63
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,325
Hey, if you guys are having

64
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,765
a father-daughter moment,
I can really...

65
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,809
No, no, no.
I just dropped by.

66
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,004
I thought I'd do
something unpredictable.

67
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,003
Kim's always pointing out
how predictable I am.

68
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,321
That's funny
coming from her.

69
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,680
You wanna talk
about predictable?

70
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,485
I'm not predictable!
Oh, come on.

71
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,880
Every single day...

72
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,166
she goes to
the same exact store,

73
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,685
right off campus,
every morning
before class...

74
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,841
and gets the same
peach yogurt drink.

75
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,921
Stop.

76
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,241
The fourth one
from the back.

77
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,924
Not the fifth one,
not the third one.

78
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,287
The fourth one
will stay cold,
but not too cold.

79
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,845
That way,
when she's drinking it, uh,

80
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,160
as a snack
in between classes...

81
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,362
It's still cold.

82
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,568
I know. I would do
exactly the same thing.

83
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,165
Yeah, the OCD gene.

84
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,281
Uh...

85
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,401
What's with the bubbly?

86
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,969
Uh, pre-birthday
celebration.

87
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,605
If you don't mind,
I just think

88
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,251
it's a little early
to pop open a bottle.

89
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,440
Yeah, no problem.

90
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,005
I'll put it in the fridge.

91
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,800
What's that?

92
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,286
Whoa. A panda.

93
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,601
That was awesome.

94
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,961
I'll leave you two.

95
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,565
Dad, don't...

96
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,922
You don't have to take it.
Now I feel bad.

97
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,923
Yeah, you should
feel bad.

98
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,606
I'll exchange it for
something more predictable.

99
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,525
Love you.
Take it easy, Jimy.

100
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,840
Bye.

101
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,962
Hey, babe.

102
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,804
Is something wrong?
Nothing.

103
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,530
Are you sure, babe?
Mmm-hmm.

104
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,883
Stop. Stop.

105
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,167
I just need
a second, okay?

106
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,047
You might want
to buckle up, Phillip.

107
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,561
Bryan.

108
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,491
How did it go?

109
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,043
Great. Fantastic.

110
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,485
Couldn't have gone better.

111
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,324
The panda was not a hit,
I take it.

112
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,481
Careful what you say.

113
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,760
He's sitting
right next to me.

114
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,684
When did she grow up, Lenore?

115
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,164
I know. It goes so fast.
All of it.

116
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,641
<i>Where are you?</i>

117
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,966
Just going home.
Make a little dinner.

118
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,288
If you'd like to join us.
"Us"?

119
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,601
Me and the panda.

120
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,891
I'll, uh, take
a rain check on that.

121
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,405
<i>If that's okay with you?</i>

122
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,806
And the panda?

123
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,841
That's fine by us.

124
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,570
<i>I'll see you.</i>

125
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,721
See you.

126
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,727
I know what you're thinking.

127
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,165
Keep it to yourself.

128
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,927
Oh, God.

129
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,051
Hey.
Lennie.

130
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,560
You changed your mind!

131
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,324
Yeah. Uh, you left
the door open.

132
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,727
Come on in.

133
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,605
Okay.

134
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,603
I'm not intruding?
No, of course you're not.

135
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,127
I was just preparing
dinner. Drink?

136
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,090
Yes, please.

137
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,847
Thanks for coming over.

138
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,280
Cheers.

139
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,525
You look stressed.
Yeah.

140
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,681
What?

141
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,046
Stuart and I...

142
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,205
We've tried everything.

143
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,840
Therapy. Counseling.
Together, separately.

144
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,962
He wants it to work.
He really does.

145
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,167
And you?

146
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,482
I know I'm hurting him.

147
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,370
I just don't feel
anything anymore.

148
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,971
I hate that.
I hate not feeling.

149
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,849
I hate going through
the motions.

150
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,045
The only thing
I feel is trapped.

151
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,810
I have
the worst taste in men!

152
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,047
Thanks.

153
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,888
Oh, no.

154
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,727
No, not you.

155
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,927
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

156
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,121
It's okay.

157
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,041
Do you know what
I fantasize about?

158
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,486
I'm afraid to ask.

159
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,047
Us.

160
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,842
Yeah?
Mmm-hmm.

161
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,360
And right after...

162
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,091
the guilt comes roaring in
and I feel like such a shit.

163
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,171
Does it make me
a bad person...

164
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,563
being married to one man,
fantasizing about another?

165
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,767
Confused maybe. Bad? No.

166
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,691
You must think I'm crazy.

167
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,003
If you are, Lennie,
you're not the only one.

168
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,005
Oh, Lennie.

169
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,125
I'm sorry.
No.

170
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,884
It's me that should be
apologizing.

171
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,850
It's not that
I don't want to.
Believe me.

172
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,045
But until you and Stuart
clear up your situation...

173
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,362
I think it would do
more harm than good.

174
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,321
For all of us.

175
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,443
Why do you have
to be so damn honorable?

176
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,480
Believe me, right now,
I wish I weren't.

177
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,529
Uh, I'm gonna go.
Wait.

178
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,127
Here.

179
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,731
I'm going out of town
in a couple of days
for a month on a job.

180
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,770
If you ever feel
you need to go someplace...

181
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,769
just to be by yourself...

182
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,327
use it.

183
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,447
Thank you.

184
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,926
I put on
six pounds of muscle.

185
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,520
Oh, you guys are
giving me a hard time.

186
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,280
Well, it's not
helping your stroke.

187
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,403
You were
plus two on the last one.

188
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,324
You?
Me?

189
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,920
Did the rest of you
get on the green?

190
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,969
I'm not even
on the green.

191
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,482
But seriously, it's money.
It would be fun.

192
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,484
I know.
I can't go, Sam.

193
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,563
It's a four-man job.
We can't do it without you.

194
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,768
I know. But a couple
of things have come up...

195
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,242
and I'm not comfortable being
away for a month right now.

196
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,330
Kim?
It's not Kim.

197
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,365
Man, you gotta let this go.
You do.

198
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,966
Lenore's a grown woman.
She can take care of herself.

199
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,690
You're not her
husband any longer.

200
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,205
But she is my friend.

201
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,647
I think you better talk
to somebody about this.

202
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,086
A shrink, maybe.

203
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,083
Why would I go to a shrink
when I got you guys?

204
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,686
There's a good point.

205
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,688
Can somebody
drop the flag stick?

206
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,721
Hey, Kim.
What's up?

207
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,166
You want me to take it out?
If you wouldn't mind.

208
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,401
Sure. When?

209
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,165
Okay, baby.

210
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,240
Okay.
The big moment.

211
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,402
That's a good shot.

212
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,610
This is an
unexpected treat.

213
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,565
Yeah, I, um,
need some advice.

214
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,322
Okay, shoot.

215
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,761
Um...

216
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,766
I guess it's not something
I was really planning on...

217
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,571
or even thought about, ever.

218
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,724
Anyway, I just
wanted your advice.

219
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,240
I'm flattered.

220
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,440
Whoa.

221
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,651
Poor lady.

222
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,647
That is going to be serious
trouble in a few years.

223
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,128
You mark my words.

224
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,931
What was it
you wanted to ask?

225
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,281
Um...

226
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,170
A puppy.

227
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,881
A puppy?
Yeah.

228
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,247
I was thinking
about getting a puppy.

229
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,925
From where?
Um...

230
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,091
My friend found one
behind her building...

231
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,524
and we were trying
to find it a home...

232
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,170
we put it on Facebook,

233
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,844
but nobody
claimed it yet, so...

234
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,161
You wanna know
what I think?

235
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,251
Yeah.

236
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,886
I mean, it's a lot of work.

237
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,564
It's a lot of
responsibility.

238
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,721
With your lifestyle

239
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,723
the way it is at the
moment, with college.

240
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,325
With a puppy
you have to be there

241
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,767
all the time
and feed it, walk it.

242
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,570
It's no different
than having a kid.

243
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,851
Have you had a chance
to look at the menus?

244
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,201
Uh, not yet, Annie.

245
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,770
What will I have?

246
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,730
Stuart.
Hey, Bryan.

247
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,041
What are you
doing here?

248
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,361
Um...

249
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,891
Everything all right?

250
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,724
Yeah. It's fine.

251
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,086
Can I talk to you inside?

252
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,481
Yeah, yeah, sure.
I was just making some coffee.

253
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,880
Milk?
Sugar?

254
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,561
Um, both, please.

255
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,646
Okay.
Milk, cold or hot?

256
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,841
Uh...

257
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,321
Hot, please.

258
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,927
So, how's business?
Oh, you know.

259
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,805
Some days good,
some days great.

260
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,321
Yeah.

261
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,763
One sugar or two?

262
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,881
Um...

263
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,567
Two, please.

264
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,082
Here we go.
Thanks.

265
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,601
Um...

266
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,444
I'm sorry to
bother you this late...

267
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,490
but I thought it was more,
um, respectful...

268
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,130
to say what
I have to say to you

269
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,765
face-to-face,
man-to-man.

270
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,729
So to speak.

271
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,201
I know that Lenore has...

272
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,091
She's spoken to you about the
problems that we've been having.

273
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,521
Um...

274
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,170
You're a good guy, Bryan.
I like you.

275
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,731
You're a respectful guy.

276
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,003
And, listen, I'm not
accusing you of anything.

277
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,288
But Lenore and I...

278
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,091
if our marriage
is gonna work...

279
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,481
that can't happen
with you in between us.

280
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,769
But, Stuart...

281
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,843
there's nothing
between Lenore and I,

282
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,763
other than we share Kim.

283
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,649
I didn't say there was.

284
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,245
Obviously...

285
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,805
you share a daughter...

286
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,691
and, uh, you've tried to be
the best father that you can,

287
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,046
under the circumstances.

288
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,530
And, uh, part of that

289
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,444
means the two of you
talking and staying in touch.

290
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,331
But I still want you
to stop seeing my wife.

291
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,641
Until we sort things out.

292
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,405
Does she know you're here?

293
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,130
It doesn't matter
if she does,
or if she doesn't.

294
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,281
That's not the point.

295
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,641
I'm asking you
to stop seeing my wife.
Can you do that?

296
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,244
I can do that.

297
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,642
Wow.
That's great.

298
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,801
Thank you.

299
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,251
I gotta go to Vegas tonight.

300
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,651
Some business
meeting tomorrow.

301
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,846
I really don't want to be
worrying about...

302
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,126
you know.
Yeah.

303
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,361
Thank you.

304
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,764
I really appreciate it.

305
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,365
"Need to see you.
Urgent. Bagels."

306
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,444
Uh, four bagels and some
cream cheese, please.

307
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,601
Okay.

308
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,727
Be careful.
They're really hot.
Thanks.

309
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,285
Have a good day. Thanks.
Take care.

310
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,281
<i>Hello?</i>

311
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,921
Lennie?

312
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,521
Lennie?

313
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,921
Lennie?

314
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,966
Lennie.

315
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,081
Jesus, God.

316
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,924
Lennie? Wake up!

317
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,925
Come on, come on!

318
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,447
Lennie!
Freeze! Don't move!

319
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,286
Step away
from the knife.

320
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,403
Get your hands up!
Sir, back away, now.

321
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,561
I didn't do this.

322
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,800
Get your
hands up, now!

323
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,281
Slowly.

324
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,327
Get your hands up.

325
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,765
You gotta listen to me.
On the floor, now!

326
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,880
Listen to me.

327
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,922
Down on the floor!
Listen to me.

328
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,041
Step away
from the knife!

329
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,485
On your knees. Now!

330
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,601
Down!

331
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,126
Get your hands up!

332
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,009
Hands up!

333
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,848
Hands up! Higher!

334
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,171
<i>I didn't do this.</i>

335
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,801
Shit! Moving in!

336
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,487
He's there!

337
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,811
Hey! Hey!

338
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,166
Drop your weapon!

339
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,160
Oh, he's heading west!

340
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,840
He's heading north.
22nd street. Back alley.

341
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,681
Stop!

342
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,481
Suspect in sight.

343
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,920
Go inside.
I'm heading back.

344
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,807
Hey!

345
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,881
Hey! Police!

346
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,121
Door's sealed!

347
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,770
- I just saw him inside.
- Shit!

348
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,686
Clear! Moving in!

349
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,440
You see him anywhere?

350
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,444
He disappeared.

351
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,521
God damn it.
He's gone.

352
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,610
This is 103.
Suspect is gone.

353
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,681
Yeah.

354
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,924
<i>Kim, it's Dad.</i>

355
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,005
Where are you?

356
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,207
I'm at Mom's.

357
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,725
Looking for my
yellow sweater.

358
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,524
<i>Are you alone?</i>

359
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,570
Stuart is in Vegas. Why?

360
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,765
I have something
to tell you.

361
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,601
Dad?

362
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,884
Dad, what's wrong?

363
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,042
<i>Something terrible
has happened.</i>

364
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,770
And I want you
to hear it from me first.

365
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,682
<i>Your mom...</i>

366
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,880
She's dead.

367
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,407
<i>Someone murdered her...</i>

368
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,801
<i>in my apartment.</i>

369
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,961
It looks like I did it.

370
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,568
<i>I don't know why.
I don't know who.</i>

371
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,526
But I'm going
to find out.

372
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,050
<i>Listen carefully, Kim.</i>

373
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,248
No matter what anyone says,
don't trust them.

374
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,806
<i>No.
You hear?</i>

375
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,240
I'll find a way
to contact you.

376
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,526
But Dad...

377
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,681
Try to be strong.

378
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,405
Dad?
I love you.

379
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,925
<i>Wait.</i>

380
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,888
Sergeant Dotzler,
suspect's name is Bryan Mills.

381
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,929
His?
His.

382
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,641
Not his.

383
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,480
The officers arrived
on the scene because...?

384
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,045
Anonymous call came in,

385
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,326
reported a woman
screaming...

386
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,880
"He's killing me.
He's killing me."

387
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,603
Her name is
Lenore St. John.

388
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,080
We sent a car to her address.
It was listed on her license.

389
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,527
Her daughter was there,
but her husband was in
Las Vegas on business.

390
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,808
He's, uh, taking
the first flight home.

391
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,122
Any witnesses?
We're canvassing now.

392
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,123
Call came from
an unlisted number.

393
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,289
We're checking out
the cells as well.

394
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,011
Download both of the phones,
correlate the data.

395
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,243
I want to know
when these two people...

396
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,807
spoke, texted, emailed.

397
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,009
Every form of communication.

398
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,366
Dates, times...

399
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,926
duration of calls.

400
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,404
Let's bag this.

401
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,846
Detective, bag that.

402
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,361
What's wrong?

403
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,125
Good.

404
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,889
<i>Right now, this is still
a very active crime scene.</i>

405
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,610
Investigators have been here
on the scene

406
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,444
<i>all morning, but so far...</i>

407
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,763
<i>police have not told us what
happened inside the apartment...</i>

408
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,160
<i>where earlier this morning...</i>

409
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,163
<i>a woman's body was discovered.</i>

410
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,842
<i>Bryan Mills is the owner
of the apartment...</i>

411
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,287
<i>and the ex-husband
of the deceased.</i>

412
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,244
- Who's this?
- It's me.

413
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,521
You're on the news.

414
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,841
<i>I didn't do it, Sam.</i>

415
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,128
Obviously, you didn't do it.
Are you all right?

416
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,085
I'm going down
the rabbit hole.
The code still the same?

417
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,520
Yeah. It's still the same.

418
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,444
I'll be in touch.
<i>Be careful.</i>

419
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,611
So, this is the area
we lost him, sir.

420
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,091
The guy vanished.

421
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,208
Uh, that's the gun
that he took, uh, off

422
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,169
one of our officers, sir.

423
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,207
He had a gun,
and he didn't fire at you?

424
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,407
No, sir.

425
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,325
And the helicopters...

426
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,851
saw nothing?

427
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,809
Choppers didn't see
anything, sir. No.

428
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,242
I know he's good...

429
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,401
but...

430
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,287
vanishing into thin air?

431
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,486
Let's move the truck.

432
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,730
Do you know why your wife
went to visit Mr. Mills?

433
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,370
No, I don't know.

434
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,046
Their relationship

435
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,760
was mostly centered
around their daughter.

436
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,491
Um, but I think...

437
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,483
he wanted more
than friendship.

438
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,961
I asked her
to speak to him...

439
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,726
and tell him that he should
stop bothering her about it.

440
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,368
So you think that's what
she was doing over there?

441
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,761
I don't know.

442
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,001
What are you doing?

443
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,601
Stuart, why are they going
through all of Mom's stuff?

444
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,121
Hey, Kim.

445
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,128
Miss St. John,
Frank Dotzler.

446
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,851
Mills.
My name is Mills.

447
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,441
Sorry for all the chaos.

448
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,131
We're just
looking around

449
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,406
to see if we can find
something to help us.

450
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,925
I know what
you're looking for.

451
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,770
I would just really like

452
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,366
them out of her bedroom
for a few minutes.

453
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,930
Garcia, let's vacate
the bedroom.

454
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,729
Everybody
out of the bedroom.

455
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,725
Thank you.

456
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,041
If I could just have
a few minutes

457
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,600
of your time.
Ask you a few questions.

458
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,725
Why aren't you out there trying
to find out who did this...

459
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,723
instead of just
standing around,
going through our home?

460
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,321
We have people
out there looking.

461
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,687
But in order for me
to get a full picture...

462
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,841
I have to ask
questions of him.

463
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,120
I have to ask
questions of you.

464
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,328
My mom went to see my dad.
I don't know why.

465
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,048
Probably to talk about me.

466
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,930
Look, there's just...

467
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,486
He didn't do it.

468
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,803
He just didn't.
He didn't do it.

469
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,724
There's no way on earth
he would lay a hand on her.

470
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,801
Just, don't.

471
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,608
He loved her.

472
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,210
That's all I know.

473
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,487
Please.

474
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,529
That's mine.
That's not even hers.

475
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,326
Excuse me.

476
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,641
I'm sorry.

477
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,407
Oh, God.

478
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,244
Come on,
let's get you home.

479
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:23,370
If something comes to mind,
anything at all...

480
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,251
it might not be
anything.

481
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,570
Um, you know what
happened in Paris

482
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,801
and Istanbul
a couple years ago...

483
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,849
where Bryan
saved his family.

484
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,571
Sure. You think
that's connected to this?

485
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,530
I never really wanted
to know all the details...

486
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,047
but a lot of people ended
up dead and now this.

487
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,720
So what you're
telling me is...

488
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,922
I'm dealing with
a very dangerous man.

489
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,001
No.

490
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,442
No. Bryan's not dangerous.

491
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,524
The world
he lives in is.

492
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,848
He loves his family...

493
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,004
but he has
a lot of enemies.

494
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,650
I see.

495
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,450
Bring him into Room Three.

496
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,681
Garcia will, uh,
get you back home.

497
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,965
Thank you.

498
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,130
<i>This guy's a ghost.</i>

499
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,487
At 21, he's in the army.

500
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,007
At 23, he joins
Special Forces.

501
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,281
Then he's gone.

502
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,130
No service record.

503
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,401
No discharge.

504
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,641
Nothing. Nothing.

505
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,245
Sounds like spy shit to me.

506
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,368
Until we have another suspect,
he's our man.

507
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,400
So here's our best way
of finding him.

508
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,010
His daughter
with the deceased.

509
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,851
Her husband says that
he's really close to her.

510
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,960
Devoted to her.

511
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,202
So let's keep
a close watch on her.

512
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,407
Where she goes,

513
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,811
who she calls,
who she talks to.

514
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,490
Let's not screw
this up, okay?

515
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,483
So, this is gonna be
our best shot...

516
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,167
at finding him.

517
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,651
Do we have
the deceased's car?

518
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,685
Yeah, that just came in.
They have his, too.

519
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,571
All right. Garcia, Smith.

520
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,449
<i>Let's do a full
sweep of the car.</i>

521
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,483
<i>GPS downloaded,
see where he went and when.</i>

522
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,721
<i>See if they correlate.</i>

523
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,124
<i>See if we can find out
what's going on.</i>

524
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,845
Just came in, his and hers.

525
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,201
Let's go, then.

526
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,326
Follow me.

527
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,800
So, what's this about?

528
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,291
Some guy
offed his ex.

529
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,164
Allegedly.

530
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,727
Right. Allegedly.

531
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,120
He didn't do her
in the car, did he?

532
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,321
No, in his house.

533
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,403
Good.
I hate going in those after.

534
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,528
Blood. Pieces of flesh
and shit.

535
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,681
It's disgusting.

536
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,765
Which GPS
you want done first?

537
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,083
His, then hers.

538
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,640
Right over here.

539
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,442
What the hell
were you doing

540
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,010
all the way
out there, Lenore?

541
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,764
Excuse me.

542
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,922
Inspector Mallory, LAPD.

543
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,005
We're following up on a missing
persons investigation.

544
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,686
I was wondering
if you'd seen this woman.

545
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,001
Nope.

546
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,849
She was here
about 10 p.m. last night.

547
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,001
I was here then.

548
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,046
I didn't see her.
I didn't see hardly nobody.

549
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,170
Not exactly
a bustling destination,
if you know what I mean.

550
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,407
Hey, Sally.

551
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,767
Excuse me.

552
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,967
Duty calls.

553
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,204
Amanda?

554
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,127
Excuse me.

555
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,882
Inspector Mallory, LAPD.

556
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,088
Are these security
cameras operative...

557
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,287
or are they
just there for show?

558
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,930
Yeah, they work.

559
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,131
Follow me.

560
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,170
You have the tape
from yesterday?

561
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,890
I wasn't here.
The other guy was.

562
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,407
But if someone was here,
it will be on there.

563
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,964
Just push that button
for the playback.

564
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,886
I'm just gonna stay here
while you look at that.

565
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,284
You have problems
with this system?

566
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,601
Breaks down sometimes.

567
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,360
They keep saying
they're gonna replace it.

568
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,525
Excuse me.

569
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,727
Have you seen
this woman?

570
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,244
You fellas should get
more coordinated.

571
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,602
Coordinated?
What do you mean?
Like, color-coordinated?

572
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,091
No, like, one of your guys

573
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,680
was just in here
asking the same thing.

574
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,285
One of our guys?
Yeah.

575
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,209
Him?
Yeah. Him.

576
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,403
Took off
to the gas station.

577
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,241
Shh.

578
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,401
Freeze!

579
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,681
Mr. Mills?

580
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,681
Freeze!

581
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,530
- Step out, buddy.
- Get out of the room.

582
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,721
Freeze!

583
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,765
Stop what you're doing,
Mr. Mills!

584
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,921
Step away from the desk!

585
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,560
Back away
from the desk, sir.

586
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,369
Step away from that desk,
or I'll shoot you!

587
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,441
Back away
from the goddamn desk!

588
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,647
Now!

589
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,046
Step away one step
from the desk.

590
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,642
Just keep your hands
where we can see them.

591
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,086
Stay perfectly still.

592
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,767
You know the drill.

593
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,041
Anything you say
can and will be

594
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,770
used against you
in a court of law.

595
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,485
You have the right
to an attorney...

596
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,291
to have one present
during questioning.

597
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,123
Brooks. All right.

598
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,966
Garcia and Smith.

599
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,121
They got him.

600
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,324
Garcia.
<i>Yeah, just picked him up.</i>

601
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,606
Easy-peasy.

602
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,330
If he's a pro
like you said...

603
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,925
<i>he wasn't on his game today.</i>

604
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,840
<i>He's playing you!
What are you talking about?</i>

605
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,121
Where is he?
Where is he?

606
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,442
He's back
in Phillips' car. Why?

607
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,681
Stop the cars!
<i>What?</i>

608
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:27,841
Stop the cars!

609
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,001
Now!

610
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,281
Oh, come on!

611
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,209
Phillips.
Yeah?

612
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,486
<i>Our boss has got a hair</i>

613
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,846
<i>up his ass about something.</i>

614
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,684
Just keep an eye
on this guy, all right?

615
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,841
Yeah, okay.

616
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,560
- They think we're idiots.
- It's unbelievable.

617
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,440
He acts like I've never
done this before.

618
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,130
He's just being Dotzler.

619
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,920
You know what it is?
He's a control freak.

620
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,720
If he's not doing it himself,
he's not happy.

621
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,441
Keep driving!

622
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:36,561
Phillips!

623
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:40,681
Come on.

624
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:11,800
What the hell is he doing?

625
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,641
Pull it over!

626
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:00,921
Back it up!

627
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:08,801
Get out of the car!

628
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,367
Drive!

629
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,681
Stop the car.

630
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,001
Come on, move.

631
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,601
Radio.

632
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,246
Cell phone.

633
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,725
This is gonna
end bad for you.

634
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,760
Don't be such a pessimist.

635
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,721
<i>Connecting to LAPD

Here, here!

00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,241
Send some backup, now!

642
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:29,647
Dotzler.

643
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,643
By now, I'm sure
you know who I am.

644
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,325
You know
what I'm capable of.

645
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:35,846
I am beginning to.

646
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,322
Let me ask you something,
just so I'm clear.

647
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,401
CIA operative?

648
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,721
Division 6?
Division 7? What?

649
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,320
All you have to know
is I'm innocent.

650
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,090
<i>Give me two days,
I can prove it.</i>

651
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,401
I can find out who did it.

652
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,925
You may very well
be innocent, Mr. Mills.

653
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,889
But that's the court's job
to decide, it's not mine.

654
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,167
<i>My job...</i>

655
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,760
is to bring you in and let the
law take its course, that's it.

656
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,370
Good luck.

657
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,683
I got a GPS on the phone.
He's heading north.

658
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,604
You want me
to send units?

659
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,683
Don't bother.
He's gone.

660
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:25,684
It's a dead end.
Wait, wait.

661
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,361
Why does he want us
to have this?

662
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,205
He fucked up.
This guy doesn't fuck up.

663
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,281
He wants us to watch it.

664
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,081
Why?

665
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,765
I don't know yet.

666
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,447
Who is she waiting for?

667
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:47,847
Who are these guys?

668
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,244
Holy shit!
Who are these guys?

669
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,126
Give me our tech guy.

670
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,129
I need some magic done
on a security tape.

671
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,651
Now. Right now.

672
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,650
Hey, let me guess.

673
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,928
Pileup on the 710 North.

674
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,243
Massive clusterfuck
of police vehicles...

675
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,970
15 miles headed south.

676
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,167
Sounds about right.

677
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,084
Hey, thanks, Sam.

678
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,000
You want to tell me
what's going on?

679
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,804
Lenore sent me a text.

680
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,883
Asked to come over
to my place for bagels.

681
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,121
I got the bagels.

682
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,329
When I came back,
I found her car out front.

683
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:38,687
Um...

684
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:41,320
She was in my bed
with her throat slashed.

685
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,001
Oh, Jesus.

686
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,326
What else?

687
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,562
I found a location
on her car's GPS

688
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:50,846
from the night before.

689
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,486
She was out at this gas station
in the middle of nowhere.

690
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,321
I saw it
on a security camera.

691
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,411
She was snatched.

692
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,925
What do you
want us to do?

693
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,082
I downloaded
all her phone records

694
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,844
from the police files.
And mine.

695
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,329
Maybe there's
something there.

696
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,685
I need analysis of this.

697
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:10,841
Her hair.

698
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,331
Might turn up something,
might turn up nothing.

699
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,205
Anything else?

700
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,610
I want to go
to the funeral.

701
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,522
<i>The Bible
constantly tells us...</i>

702
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,603
that there will be
difficult times in life...

703
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,524
when we feel like
we are walking...

704
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,682
through a dark,
dangerous valley.

705
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,727
Valley of the shadow
of death.

706
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,201
But what the word of God
does make very clear...

707
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,522
is that, as we move
through such times...

708
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,205
"the Lord is my shepherd.

709
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,761
"He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

710
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:44,131
<i>"He leadeth me
beside still waters. "</i>

711
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,405
In the name
of the Father...

712
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:47,886
and of the Son...

713
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,811
<i>and of the Holy Spirit.</i>

714
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,926
<i>Are you holding up?</i>

715
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,570
- Right there.
Mmm-hmm.

716
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:03,722
Get me sound on that.
Right there.

717
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,766
Kim, I'm so sorry.

718
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,884
<i>If there's
anything we can do...</i>

719
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:12,890
Hey.

720
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,806
We're there for you.

721
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:16,280
<i>- You know that, right?
Mmm-hmm.</i>

722
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,969
Hey, baby.
Hey.

723
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:23,770
<i>I just want to go home.</i>

724
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:28,845
You hear that?

725
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,081
You hear that click?

726
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,120
Yeah. We're getting some
interference somewhere.

727
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,970
There it goes again.

728
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,170
Hey.
Hi.

729
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:42,761
Oh, sweetie.

730
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,286
They're jamming our signal.

731
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,808
I know.
I know.

732
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:50,647
I'm so, so sorry.

733
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:51,926
Listen.

734
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:53,930
He'll be in touch.

735
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,804
Just stick
to your schedule.

736
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,446
Your very
predictable schedule.

737
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:34,571
You want me to
put a tail on them?

738
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,246
No, it's a waste of time.
It'd be a waste of our money.

739
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,686
These guys could lose a tail

740
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:40,250
if it was attached to a dog.

741
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:41,686
We're done.

742
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:42,927
Cut the feed.

743
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,286
Stuart,
why are there still...

744
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,362
Why are there still
cops camped outside?

745
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:22,207
Uh, I think it's standard
operating procedure.

746
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:25,284
They think my dad's
going to show up here?
Are they stupid or something?

747
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,602
I don't know
what they think.

748
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,565
Inspector Dotzler asked
if we minded and I said no.

749
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:33,286
You should have asked me.
I mind.

750
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,401
I'm sorry.

751
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:36,647
And who's he?

752
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,401
Well, um...

753
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,725
We need protection.

754
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:43,641
Kim, honey,

755
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:45,680
I know it's hard on you,
but it's hard on me, too.

756
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,123
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
it was a competition.

757
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,404
It's not a competition.

758
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,801
Please, don't hate me.

759
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,883
I'm not responsible
for what happened.

760
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,768
I don't hate you, Stuart.

761
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,242
But for the last two years...

762
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,641
every time I looked
into my mom's eyes...

763
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:07,650
the only thing I saw
was hurt and sadness.

764
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,640
And for that...

765
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:12,810
I do hold you responsible.

766
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,525
Where are you going?
School

767
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,763
If I'm allowed.

768
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,923
I got you, baby.
I got you.

769
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,280
Hmm.

770
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:20,811
Why are you following me?

771
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,320
It's for your
own protection, miss.

772
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,368
Protection?
From who?

773
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:26,488
My father?

774
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,847
You really think
my father would hurt me?

775
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,162
Your mother probably
didn't think so either.

776
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,001
Asshole.

777
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:40,921
- Hey.
- Hey.

778
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,247
Anything?

779
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,084
<i>She's on campus.
You want me to follow?</i>

780
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,571
Is the bug active?

781
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:24,724
Yes.
<i>Okay. Stay there. Listen.</i>

782
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,211
If he shows up,
we'll hear it.

783
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,681
<i>What else?</i>
She went into this
convenience store,

784
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:30,205
chugged down
a drink of some kind...

785
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,687
<i>right from the fridge.</i>
All right.

786
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:34,046
<i>Keep me informed.</i>

787
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:09,170
<i>As you might
remember, last week...</i>

788
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,527
we discussed
disassociations...

789
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:15,685
and interactions between
dorsal and ventral streams...

790
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,330
<i>in object recognition.</i>

791
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,369
<i>Now, a dominant hypothesis...</i>

792
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,649
is that the dorsal stream
is supporting

793
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,961
motor interactions
with objects.

794
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,527
While ventral stream
structures extract

795
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:27,931
visual information...

796
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:30,361
about the object
that is independent.

797
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:32,160
I'm feeling
a little nauseous.

798
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:34,125
Would you mind
taking notes for me?

799
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:35,645
Yeah, sure.
Thanks.

800
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,968
Now,
in other words,
object knowledge

801
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:40,122
is represented
in the ventral stream...

802
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,166
Excuse me.
I wonder if you could, um,
help me out with something?

803
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,401
Sure.

804
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:54,964
There was a young woman
in here...

805
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:56,804
about an hour ago?
Oh, yeah.

806
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:57,961
Poor kid.

807
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,645
Does she come here often?
Every day.

808
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:00,721
She bought what?

809
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,643
Same thing,
a peach yogurt drink.

810
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,565
But today, she drank it all
right there from the fridge.

811
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:07,688
Must have been thirsty.

812
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:27,321
You got anything?

813
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:29,641
<i>Yeah, she went to school.
Got nauseous in class.</i>

814
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,205
Now she's on her way
to the bathroom.

815
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:32,361
Call for back-up.

816
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:33,846
<i>I'm coming right now.</i>

817
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:54,121
Shh!

818
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:09,566
Shh.

819
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:15,486
Here, Kim. Drink this.

820
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:17,722
I put something in the yogurt
to make you nauseous.

821
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:19,609
This will take it away.

822
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:27,441
Hi, baby.

823
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:28,881
Hi.

824
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,968
Oh, Kim. Kim.

825
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,605
Oh, Kim.

826
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:42,287
Daddy. I don't know
what to do.

827
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:44,646
I'm pregnant.

828
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,081
What?

829
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,089
I'm pregnant.

830
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:58,601
Dad?

831
01:01:58,720 --> 01:01:59,721
I'm okay.

832
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:03,851
I have low blood sugar.

833
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,843
I haven't eaten
since yesterday.

834
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,401
Um...

835
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:11,681
Eat this.

836
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:26,602
Don't you worry.

837
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,882
Let's get through
this first and then...

838
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:31,805
we'll figure out
what's best for...

839
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:34,282
What you have to do
is act natural.

840
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:35,965
This cop is really smart.

841
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:37,645
Anything out of the usual...

842
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:40,280
he'll become suspicious.
Okay?

843
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,130
I love you.

844
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:45,970
I love you, too.

845
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,809
Yes.
Where are you?

846
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,365
I'm in the science building.
East wing.

847
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:01,521
<i>She's in the bathroom.</i>

848
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:03,244
Don't move.
Wait for me.

849
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,525
Where are you staying?

850
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,484
I'm still at Mom's.

851
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:15,201
I started packing her stuff.

852
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:18,685
It doesn't feel real.

853
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:20,205
Oh, I know.

854
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:22,444
I know.

855
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,684
Dad, there's...

856
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,725
Stuart's been acting
really weird.

857
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,644
He must be scared
about something.

858
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,370
He hired bodyguards.

859
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:39,841
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

860
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:41,530
It was so much fun.
But you know what?

861
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,523
- He was such a jerk.
- Really?

862
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,680
He made me pay for
my own drink at the bar.

863
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,200
I was wearing something
more skimpy than this.

864
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,400
More skimpy than that?
I don't know
what was happening.

865
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:53,885
Maybe he's blind.
I don't know.

866
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,166
I don't know.

867
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:02,566
He is such a jerk.

868
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:03,721
I'm not gonna do
it again, though.

869
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:04,926
No, it's cool,
I've seen him.

870
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:06,206
I completely understand.

871
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,482
He's hot, right?

872
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,360
- Go, go, go!
- I'm going!

873
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:17,401
Go, go, go.

874
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:28,970
What the...?

875
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:30,081
Excuse me?

876
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:32,921
Perv!

877
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:35,761
He just left.

878
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:39,925
She's in the can.

879
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,445
I can't let you leave.

880
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:48,121
Seal all the areas.

881
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:54,367
Hey!

882
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:07,281
There he is.

883
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:08,801
Down the south corridor!

884
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,007
Freeze!

885
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,485
Go, go, go!

886
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:34,361
Move!

887
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:39,164
Just move! Come on!

888
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:40,846
This way!
Move, move!

889
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:15,761
I know you think
you're helping him...

890
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:16,921
but you're not.

891
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:18,681
You're not.

892
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:20,365
Unless we get him
to come in...

893
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:22,841
I can't start trying to make
sense of what happened.

894
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,362
Someone killed my mom.

895
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,205
That's what happened.

896
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,880
It was not my father.

897
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:31,440
Without hearing
his side of the story,

898
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:32,720
they can't know that,
can they?

899
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,046
I do.

900
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:38,520
Is there anything else?

901
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:39,881
You know we can arrest you

902
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:42,042
for obstructing
an ongoing investigation?

903
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:44,721
Arrest me.

904
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:47,927
Rather not.

905
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:50,683
Well, then,
if you're not going to,

906
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:51,966
can I go home?

907
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,448
Of course. Of course.

908
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:01,041
Thank you.

909
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,649
Interesting family.

910
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,330
Don't worry,

911
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,971
<i>we will take care of this.
Do as we planned.</i>

912
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:21,966
Call the car.

913
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:23,690
Where are we going, boss?

914
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:24,921
The Malibu house.

915
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:47,969
Okay, let's go get drunk.

916
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:10,161
I'm not gonna hurt you.

917
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:12,761
I need a ride.
Mind if I drive?

918
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:14,206
Okay.

919
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,647
What's your name?

920
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:28,767
Mike.

921
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:32,370
I'm Bryan.
You have kids, Mike?

922
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:33,646
Yeah, two.
Uh-huh.

923
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:37,529
How old?
Owen is three,
and Tori is seven.

924
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:38,600
Great age.

925
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:41,405
A piece of advice.
Don't miss a day of it.

926
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:45,562
Before you know it,
they'll be having
kids of their own.

927
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:46,721
Know what I mean?

928
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:00,681
Thanks, Mike.

929
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:10,448
Uh-huh.
You know,
if you stand in a field

930
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:12,443
with a book of matches...

931
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:15,809
you can have hundreds
of rabbits in seconds...

932
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,206
like this.

933
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:18,521
You know how?
No.

934
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:25,525
Come in, all rabbits.

935
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,651
Come in, all rabbits.
You like this?

936
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:53,600
Who hired you?

937
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:56,761
Huh?

938
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:00,011
Who are you working for?

939
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:02,520
Your accent is shit!

940
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,450
Who are you working for?

941
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,603
I'd rather die than tell you.

942
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:09,926
Scumbag!

943
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,889
Boss?
They're at the gate.

944
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:35,327
Let them in.

945
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:37,561
Oh, and take a stroll.

946
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:39,245
I need a little privacy.

947
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:00,765
Many?

948
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:02,886
Many?

949
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:32,760
Oh!

950
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:40,161
Bryan?

951
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:01,528
None of this is making
sense to me, Stuart.

952
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:05,409
I was hoping
you could help me out.

953
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:07,721
How did you...

954
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:09,803
Survive the crash?

955
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:16,651
<i>The Russians
who were following me
when I was following you...</i>

956
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:18,001
do they work
for you, Stuart?

957
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:20,240
No.
I don't know what you're talking about.

958
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:21,481
What do you know?

959
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:23,840
The only thing I know is that
you were fucking my wife.

960
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:26,242
And I know
that she's dead!

961
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:27,447
No, no, no!

962
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:40,727
What do you know?

963
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:42,370
I don't know anything.

964
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:44,363
I swear.
I don't know anything.

965
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,086
If I believed that,
we wouldn't be here.

966
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:47,685
No! No! No!

967
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:52,604
Malankov,
Malankov, Malankov!

968
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:54,560
What?

969
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:55,721
Malankov.

970
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:58,241
Oleg Malankov.

971
01:16:58,600 --> 01:16:59,647
Who is Oleg Malankov?

972
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:01,251
I owe him money.

973
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:02,481
You don't know him.

974
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:06,407
He'll never give up.
It's only a game for him.

975
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:09,251
I lost everything.
He said he'd kill my family.

976
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:10,970
Why didn't you tell
this to the police?

977
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:12,160
You let them
think it was me.

978
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:13,321
I was angry with you.

979
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:14,760
God damn it, you promised!

980
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:16,080
You promised
to stop seeing her!

981
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:17,280
So what do you
think happened?

982
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:18,566
She came over to my place.

983
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:20,369
This Malankov
followed her there?

984
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:22,000
If you weren't seeing her
behind my back...

985
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:23,969
she wouldn't have been there
in the first place, would she?

986
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:25,770
They would have killed her
someplace else.

987
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:27,445
So why are they
coming after me?

988
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:30,482
Because I told them
who you were.

989
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:33,450
That you would find them
and kill them.

990
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,762
How convenient
would that be for you?

991
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:37,962
I kill them,
your debt is cancelled.

992
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,609
I'm sorry, Bryan.

993
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:42,962
But I loved her.
You gotta believe me.

994
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:45,282
I loved her!
I loved her!

995
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:47,124
Here's what you're gonna do.

996
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:49,965
You're gonna go to the police
and tell them everything.

997
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:52,046
I can't.

998
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:54,487
I can't. He's crazy.
You don't know him.

999
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:57,723
You can do whatever
the hell you want.
Either way...

1000
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,650
I'm a dead man.

1001
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:00,961
I'm dead.

1002
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:02,884
They kill you,
they don't get paid.

1003
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:06,165
You're not the one they're
gonna come after next.

1004
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:09,966
Kim.

1005
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:32,161
Hey.

1006
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:34,321
Can I get
your keys, please?

1007
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:37,884
Do you know what you're
getting yourself into, man?

1008
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:39,280
Yeah. As a matter
of fact, I do.

1009
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:41,200
Could I get your keys
and your phone, please?

1010
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,281
You mind putting your
hands on the steering wheel?

1011
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:50,368
Or what?
What are you gonna do?
Shoot me?

1012
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:52,841
Left or right?

1013
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:56,046
Go ahead, put the cuffs on.

1014
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:06,762
Thank you very much.

1015
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:43,129
Dad!

1016
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:45,805
Let's go, Kim.

1017
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,205
What's going on?

1018
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:52,407
We're keeping you safe.

1019
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:55,287
Sam?

1020
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:56,885
Hey, Kim. We're gonna
get in the truck.

1021
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:58,247
Hi, Kim.

1022
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:02,481
Let's go.

1023
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:09,890
<i>Bernard Harris.</i>

1024
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:12,448
He's a trained sniper.

1025
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,367
Left the army at 24.

1026
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:16,851
Nothing, nothing after that.

1027
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:21,324
Nothing until he registers
as one of three founders

1028
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:23,971
of something called Private
Securities International.

1029
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:28,403
The other two being,
Casey Mark,

1030
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:32,121
Navy SEAL,
eight years' service.

1031
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:33,770
"Explosives expert."
It's right there.

1032
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:37,842
Next time we hear
from him, he's 45

1033
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:40,764
and Senior Vice President

1034
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:43,241
of Private Securities
International.

1035
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:46,847
Sam Grossman,
communications expert,

1036
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:49,002
a wizard,

1037
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:54,723
And he's the COO of Private
Securities International.

1038
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:59,689
Now, our primary person
of interest...

1039
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,769
Bryan Mills.

1040
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:11,569
Is listed as an "employee"
of Private...

1041
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:12,801
You get the picture.

1042
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:18,363
These are very
serious people.

1043
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,886
If you don't
bring your A-game,

1044
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:23,440
they're gonna run around you,
through you, under you.

1045
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:26,285
I need it to stop
right now.

1046
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:29,521
There's one more thing.
This.

1047
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:38,481
The Russian,
he killed himself.

1048
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:41,043
Probably because he didn't
wanna give up the information

1049
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,804
that Mills was
asking him for.

1050
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:46,566
Because obviously,
he's not trying to kill you.

1051
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:50,201
Obviously, he's not
trying to kill anybody.

1052
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:53,204
He's only trying
to get information.

1053
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:55,487
He's only trying to figure
this out, just like we are.

1054
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:58,848
Except for the fact that
he is a step ahead of us.

1055
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:02,402
I'd like to know the relationship
between the Russians

1056
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:05,205
and the wife's murder.

1057
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:08,444
One of these four people,
they know something about it.

1058
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:10,363
They know the answer.

1059
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:12,726
I need you guys
to find them.

1060
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:15,724
I need you
to bring them in.

1061
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:26,245
- Anything yet?
- No.

1062
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,721
Nothing came up from the
samples you gave me.

1063
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:30,331
But this is gonna take
a while to sort through.

1064
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:32,448
Bryan, there's a shitload
of data here.

1065
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:34,011
What is that?

1066
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:36,402
I downloaded
the police computers.

1067
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:38,800
For what?
The first thing
they're gonna look at...

1068
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:41,082
are the phone records to see
if there are any clues.

1069
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:42,321
Mine and Lenore's.

1070
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:43,606
What's it gonna tell you,

1071
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:45,240
that you and Lenore
spoke to each other?

1072
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:46,651
You know what?
Don't worry about it.

1073
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:48,131
We're almost
done here anyway.

1074
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:49,691
So, what's the plan?

1075
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,763
The plan is to make sure
my daughter is safe.

1076
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:53,922
And the only way
to do that, so it seems...

1077
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:56,321
is to eliminate the thing
that will make her unsafe.

1078
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:57,926
Malankov.

1079
01:22:58,080 --> 01:22:59,809
Good one, Stuart.

1080
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,925
I'd like to help.

1081
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:03,531
Oh, you're
gonna help, all right.

1082
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:05,170
Like bait helps
to catch a shark.

1083
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:06,526
Excuse me?

1084
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:08,284
Start talking
about Malankov.

1085
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:09,885
I want to know every detail.

1086
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:12,008
Who he is, what he does,
where he lives...

1087
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:13,446
where he works.

1088
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:16,167
Oleg Malankov.

1089
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:18,965
He's as tough
as they come.

1090
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,290
<i>He served in the Russian Army</i>

1091
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:23,930
<i>when they invaded
Afghanistan.</i>

1092
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:29,046
<i>He was Spetsnaz.</i>

1093
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:31,011
<i>It's like our Navy SEALS.</i>

1094
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:33,763
<i>After the collapse
of the Soviet Union,</i>

1095
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:35,444
<i>when everyone was
grabbing what they could...</i>

1096
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:37,045
<i>there was a real demand</i>

1097
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:38,451
<i>for men with
his kind of skills.</i>

1098
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:40,364
<i>He became
one of the grabbers.</i>

1099
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:48,851
<i>I met him
when I was doing a deal</i>

1100
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:50,724
<i>involving heavy machinery.</i>

1101
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:52,206
<i>Since then,
we did business</i>

1102
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:53,725
<i>on a number
of different occasions.</i>

1103
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:56,126
<i>Some deals worked out.</i>

1104
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:00,365
I don't have the money.

1105
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,131
Last one didn't.

1106
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:08,481
What?

1107
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:13,284
My mom is dead because of one
of your shitty business deals?

1108
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:14,401
No.

1109
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:15,891
Kim, that's not
what happened.

1110
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:17,606
Fuck you!

1111
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:21,327
I'll fucking kill you!
Kim.

1112
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:22,527
We need him.

1113
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:25,286
We need him.

1114
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:32,440
Call him.

1115
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:33,881
Why?

1116
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:35,560
Because you're gonna
set him up for me.

1117
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:38,211
Make the call. Now.

1118
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:42,407
On speaker.

1119
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:51,565
Pow.

1120
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:06,445
Stuart. I've missed you.

1121
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:07,601
I have your money.

1122
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:08,761
<i>You have it?</i>

1123
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:10,445
<i>That was fast.</i>

1124
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:11,761
How can I trust you?

1125
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:13,291
<i>You can trust me.</i>

1126
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:15,285
Where do you want me
to bring it?

1127
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:17,727
Meet me at the building
downtown.

1128
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:19,001
<i>In one hour.</i>

1129
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:22,401
Sure, one hour.

1130
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:23,481
Scumbag!

1131
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:25,924
Tell me how
his security works.

1132
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:29,923
<i>Malankov works out
of his penthouse apartment.</i>

1133
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:34,082
<i>He has a private elevator
with two bodyguards.</i>

1134
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:36,124
Malankov is coming.
Send the elevator.

1135
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:37,850
<i>The elevator is controlled</i>

1136
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:39,524
<i>by security upstairs.</i>

1137
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:42,440
<i>Once they see who's inside the
elevator and give the okay...</i>

1138
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:43,811
<i>they will send
the elevator up.</i>

1139
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:47,442
<i>Outside the elevator,
upstairs...</i>

1140
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:50,922
<i>is a security station
and three more bodyguards.</i>

1141
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:52,841
<i>Two sets of doors.</i>

1142
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:55,010
<i>Through the second set
of doors</i>

1143
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:56,889
<i>is Malankov's
private apartment.</i>

1144
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:12,520
Can you
help me out, here?

1145
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:14,483
I got an address
but I don't have a name.

1146
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:16,005
I got a back
full of perishables.

1147
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:17,650
Go to the first floor
and ask for the desk.

1148
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:19,000
First floor.
Thank you so much.

1149
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:20,121
You're welcome.

1150
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:35,287
Hello, sir.

1151
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:36,850
I'm here to see
Oleg Malankov.

1152
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:38,371
Okay, sir,
have a good day.

1153
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:39,521
Thanks.

1154
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:52,691
Get out.

1155
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:15,601
It's Dotzler.

1156
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:16,886
Answer it. Act normal.

1157
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:18,969
Don't try
anything smart.

1158
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:20,685
- Hello?
- Mr. St. John?

1159
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:22,041
Frank Dotzler.

1160
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:23,281
Where are you?

1161
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:24,726
Um, I'm in
a business meeting.

1162
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:25,966
Is there anything wrong?

1163
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:28,282
Bryan Mills removed your
stepdaughter from your home.

1164
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:29,487
<i>I'm there right now.</i>

1165
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:31,245
Oh, my God.
That's, um...

1166
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:32,401
<i>When are you coming home?</i>

1167
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:33,561
I'm leaving immediately.

1168
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:35,927
<i>It should take me
about an hour to
get there from where I am.</i>

1169
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:38,367
Where exactly is that?
Malibu.

1170
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:41,928
Listen, Inspector,
I don't think he
means her any harm.

1171
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:44,242
Mr. St. John, this man
is the prime suspect

1172
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:45,771
in the murder of your wife.

1173
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:48,161
His associates
held guns on my men

1174
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:50,248
in the front of your home.

1175
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:51,731
As far as I'm concerned,
he is dangerous

1176
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:53,080
<i>and has to be
taken into custody.</i>

1177
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:54,480
So, if you'd like,
I can send a car for you,

1178
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:55,800
but I need you
somewhere safe.

1179
01:27:55,960 --> 01:27:58,281
No, no, no.
It's fine.

1180
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:00,090
I'm leaving right now.

1181
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,004
I'll be waiting for you.

1182
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:10,286
Get me a location
on St. John's phone.

1183
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:12,010
As soon as he finds
out you're not in Malibu,

1184
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:13,161
he'll be headed right here.

1185
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:14,810
I'd say we have

1186
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:16,928
less than 30 minutes to do
this before he shows up.

1187
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:18,161
It's enough time for me.

1188
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:19,401
Can you handle this, Kim?

1189
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:20,761
What do I have to do?

1190
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:22,520
Just keep me up to
date on what comes up.

1191
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:23,687
Thanks, Sam.

1192
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:27,686
Inspector, the tape you gave
us from that gas station...

1193
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:29,604
here are the stills,
frame by frame.

1194
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:35,121
Hey.

1195
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:36,691
He lied to you
about where he was.

1196
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:38,763
What a surprise.
He's downtown.

1197
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:40,046
Let's call out
the cavalry.

1198
01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:41,121
All right.

1199
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:42,527
We're out
of this location!

1200
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:44,967
We're on the move!
Let's go!

1201
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:51,606
They're gone.

1202
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:53,450
Okay. Cops on the move.

1203
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:55,126
Okay. Let's go.

1204
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:58,363
You do exactly
as you were told.

1205
01:28:58,440 --> 01:28:59,521
Don't improvise.

1206
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:01,682
Try anything funny,
and they'll kill you.

1207
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:03,808
And if they don't, I will.

1208
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:22,808
I don't know how many times
I can say sorry.

1209
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:30,801
Come here, Kim.

1210
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:35,081
There.

1211
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:45,321
Dotzler.

1212
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:46,891
I found out something
you might wanna know.

1213
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:50,329
<i>Matching insurance policies
on St. John and his wife.</i>

1214
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:52,403
$12 million. Each.

1215
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:54,722
<i>How about that?</i>

1216
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:06,204
Stuart St. John.
Mr. Malankov's expecting me.

1217
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:07,727
What's in the bag?

1218
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:14,121
We're in.

1219
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:18,642
Okay.

1220
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:22,691
Stuart St. John is clear.
Unlock the elevator.

1221
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:29,800
Okay.

1222
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:31,811
Got him.

1223
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:34,451
Go! All right.

1224
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:35,885
What's going on?

1225
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:37,561
Everything okay?

1226
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:45,767
Mmm-hmm.

1227
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:48,486
Call the elevator.

1228
01:30:55,640 --> 01:30:56,641
Get back to the truck.

1229
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:07,761
Bingo.

1230
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:09,886
Right on.

1231
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:23,325
Mmm.

1232
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:33,250
He's coming up.

1233
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:36,442
Go, go, go.

1234
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:38,125
Showtime. Bingo.

1235
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:40,524
What the hell's going on?

1236
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:47,600
Guys?

1237
01:31:57,160 --> 01:31:58,400
Go check it out.

1238
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:12,761
Get up.

1239
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:15,921
Get up!

1240
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:49,008
Who are you, old man?

1241
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:51,242
You killed my ex-wife.

1242
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:55,842
But you're not gonna
kill my daughter.

1243
01:35:58,560 --> 01:35:59,561
Your daughter?

1244
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:02,440
Shit!

1245
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:06,042
We are fucked
by the same man.

1246
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:08,805
What are you talking about?

1247
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:10,769
Stuart St. John.

1248
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:14,442
First, he gets me
to kill your wife...

1249
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:15,647
then you.

1250
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:18,567
And when that
doesn't work...

1251
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:21,371
he pushes you
to kill me, no?

1252
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:24,524
Either way, he wins.

1253
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:28,082
Your wife was just
part of a business deal...

1254
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:32,528
like many before her.

1255
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:37,643
It is my turn
to lose the game.

1256
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:38,767
Finish me!

1257
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:41,209
Finish me.

1258
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:43,689
I deserve it.

1259
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:49,325
Yes.

1260
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,286
You do.

1261
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:30,361
Dad?

1262
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:31,686
<i>Listen.</i>

1263
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:35,251
- Dad?
- What is it, Kim?

1264
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:36,400
No!
Ahhh!

1265
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:37,880
Sam! Sam!

1266
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:39,241
Kim.

1267
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:40,606
Come on. Let's go.

1268
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:42,811
Come on. Move.
Kim!

1269
01:37:46,120 --> 01:37:47,406
Get in the car!

1270
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:48,561
Let's go, come on!

1271
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,081
Where are we going?

1272
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:52,321
Get in the car.

1273
01:38:24,160 --> 01:38:25,764
He's still alive.
Let's get a medic in here...

1274
01:38:25,960 --> 01:38:27,962
<i>ASAP! Medic!</i>

1275
01:38:28,680 --> 01:38:29,681
Inspector!

1276
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:31,330
Yeah?
The elevator!

1277
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:32,481
Dotzler, it's Smith.

1278
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:33,720
<i>We're in Malankov's building.</i>

1279
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:35,444
<i>I think, uh, Mills is here.</i>
Really?

1280
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:37,240
Yeah. We're gonna check
the apartment now.

1281
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:41,801
Shit!

1282
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:44,331
Hey! Can you move?

1283
01:38:55,080 --> 01:38:56,605
Back it up.
Back it up.

1284
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:07,731
All right, let's go.
Everybody in.

1285
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:09,131
Come on!
Let's go!

1286
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:28,880
This guy's still warm.

1287
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:30,331
We got a good chance
he's still in the building.

1288
01:39:30,440 --> 01:39:31,805
Call downstairs,
lock it up.

1289
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:33,564
Nobody in, nobody out.

1290
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:43,563
Lock it up.
Nobody in, nobody out.

1291
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:18,485
<i>"Text from your phone
asking Mom to meet you...</i>

Santa Monica Aviation.

1296
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:49,367
This is Mr. St. John.

1297
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:51,801
I'll be there in 15 minutes.
Get the plane ready.

1298
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:52,961
<i>It'll be ready.</i>

1299
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:56,966
Why are you doing this?

1300
01:40:58,520 --> 01:41:00,124
Because your father
and his friends

1301
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:01,480
are homicidal maniacs.

1302
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:03,369
You're a lying piece of shit.
Shut up.

1303
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:04,567
You killed her! I know...

1304
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:06,006
You shut up!

1305
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:07,326
Shut up!

1306
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:13,006
Brooks.

1307
01:41:13,160 --> 01:41:14,571
I want the full work-up
on a black Porsche,

1308
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:17,610
license plate number
6-8-9-M-J-C-6.

1309
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:18,681
Okay.

1310
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:20,211
<i>Connect me to the Porsche
phone and trace it.</i>

1311
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:21,281
All right.

1312
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:25,564
I need a run on
a California plate

1313
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:27,648
6-8-9-Mary-Jane-Charlie-6.

1314
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:28,801
I need a phone, too.

1315
01:41:38,840 --> 01:41:40,171
Pick up the phone.

1316
01:41:42,360 --> 01:41:43,691
<i>Black Porsche's
phone position received.</i>

1317
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:44,841
<i>Heading west.</i>

1318
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:48,004
Yes?

1319
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:49,406
Listen, Mr. Mills.

1320
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:50,607
<i>It's Dotzler.</i>

1321
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:52,330
I've started to piece
this thing together.

1322
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:54,847
<i>There's two
life insurance policies.</i>

1323
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:56,690
One for St. John,
one for your ex-wife.

1324
01:41:56,880 --> 01:41:58,530
<i>You understand?</i>

1325
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:01,090
Stuart owed money
to these Russians.

1326
01:42:01,240 --> 01:42:02,287
<i>A lot of it.</i>

1327
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:03,400
The ones who abducted her.

1328
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:04,851
Then they took her
to my place

1329
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:06,520
and killed her to
keep me out of the way.

1330
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:09,091
I need you to step back...

1331
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:10,480
and allow me to handle this.

1332
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:11,681
<i>I got it.</i>

1333
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:13,604
What's your first
priority here, Inspector?

1334
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:16,246
To arrest St. John

1335
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:17,960
and charge him
with your ex-wife's murder.

1336
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:21,691
My first priority
is my daughter.

1337
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:41,561
Get out of the car.

1338
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:43,567
Come on, let's go.

1339
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:46,807
Go!

1340
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:56,248
Okay, we're leaving now.
Come on, let's go.

1341
01:42:56,440 --> 01:42:57,441
Yes, sir!

1342
01:43:03,080 --> 01:43:04,570
Approaching
Runway Two.

1343
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:05,926
Ready for takeoff.

1344
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:07,491
Come on, guys.
Let's go.

1345
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:09,240
Requesting
permission for takeoff.

1346
01:43:10,760 --> 01:43:12,683
<i>We got a visual
on the Porsche.</i>

1347
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:14,762
<i>He's heading to
Santa Monica airport.</i>

1348
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:24,766
I want all units in the area
of the Santa Monica airport...

1349
01:43:24,920 --> 01:43:26,968
to be on the lookout
for a black Porsche.

1350
01:43:47,480 --> 01:43:48,481
No.

1351
01:43:56,040 --> 01:43:57,041
Let's go!

1352
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:07,360
- Come on!
- We don't have enough speed!

1353
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:09,801
Let's go!

1354
01:44:26,680 --> 01:44:27,920
Give me
the goddamn gun!

1355
01:44:30,040 --> 01:44:31,405
Give me the goddamn gun!

1356
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:36,522
I'll shoot you
in the head!

1357
01:44:36,680 --> 01:44:37,727
Shut up!

1358
01:44:55,160 --> 01:44:56,207
Very smart...

1359
01:44:57,040 --> 01:44:58,565
Playing me off
against the Russian.

1360
01:45:00,680 --> 01:45:01,886
Coming over for coffee.

1361
01:45:02,040 --> 01:45:04,611
Taking my phone,
sending texts
and then erasing them.

1362
01:45:11,080 --> 01:45:12,411
So that your pals...

1363
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:13,686
could plant Lenore's body...

1364
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:15,240
and make it look
as if I killed her.

1365
01:45:22,040 --> 01:45:23,246
All your problems solved.

1366
01:45:23,720 --> 01:45:25,290
All your worries over.

1367
01:45:25,680 --> 01:45:27,728
But it didn't quite
work out that way.

1368
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:31,603
Oh, listen, Bryan.

1369
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:33,526
They're coming.

1370
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:37,283
You can't kill me now.

1371
01:45:41,400 --> 01:45:43,084
Oh. yeah?

1372
01:45:44,240 --> 01:45:45,241
Dad...

1373
01:45:51,080 --> 01:45:53,321
I know you know
a lot of people...

1374
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:55,280
and with a good lawyer,
you'll get out of jail

1375
01:45:55,320 --> 01:45:56,446
in a few years.

1376
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:58,921
And then I'll come for you.

1377
01:45:59,120 --> 01:46:01,088
I'll find you.

1378
01:46:01,240 --> 01:46:02,765
And we both know
what's gonna happen.

1379
01:46:51,320 --> 01:46:53,891
<i>I knew
from the beginning.</i>

1380
01:46:55,320 --> 01:46:57,163
It was the bagels.

1381
01:46:57,880 --> 01:46:59,689
They were warm.

1382
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:00,887
I had to ask myself...

1383
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:04,681
what kind of guy
goes out for warm bagels...

1384
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:07,161
and comes back
and commits murder?

1385
01:47:07,320 --> 01:47:11,166
So, I compared the timestamps
to the deleted texts...

1386
01:47:12,040 --> 01:47:14,327
that you downloaded
from our computers.

1387
01:47:15,480 --> 01:47:17,881
Which, by the way,
is illegal, and I could
arrest you for it.

1388
01:47:18,160 --> 01:47:20,686
I could.
But it's got me.

1389
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:23,807
And I was able
to figure it out.

1390
01:47:24,840 --> 01:47:25,841
She was leaving him.

1391
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:29,525
He needed the insurance money
to pay Malankov.

1392
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:32,280
You didn't help us out
by escaping, you know.

1393
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:35,284
He figured,
what better way

1394
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:37,480
to get rid of Malankov and
keep the insurance money...

1395
01:47:38,760 --> 01:47:40,091
than by getting me

1396
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:42,049
to kill the guy
who would kill him...

1397
01:47:42,680 --> 01:47:45,843
because it was the only way
to keep my daughter safe.

1398
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:48,371
Almost worked.

1399
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:50,684
Almost.

1400
01:47:53,440 --> 01:47:56,205
So, are we done, Inspector?

1401
01:47:57,040 --> 01:47:58,041
Of course.

1402
01:47:59,200 --> 01:48:00,247
Of course we're done.

1403
01:48:04,120 --> 01:48:05,121
We're done.

1404
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:09,081
Could you, um,

1405
01:48:09,160 --> 01:48:10,730
just stay in town
for the next month or so...

1406
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:12,800
just in case I have any
other questions for you?

1407
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:14,921
Sure.

1408
01:48:48,920 --> 01:48:50,285
Now, you two.

1409
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:52,482
I've thought
about this all night.

1410
01:48:54,120 --> 01:48:55,963
It's a very
important choice.

1411
01:48:56,600 --> 01:48:57,965
Whatever you decide...

1412
01:48:58,120 --> 01:49:00,851
the two of you, together...

1413
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:05,282
I'll support you 100%.

1414
01:49:06,240 --> 01:49:09,642
And I know your mom would have
said the same thing, too.

1415
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:14,164
Tell him.
Dad...

1416
01:49:14,600 --> 01:49:16,125
we've been talking.

1417
01:49:16,480 --> 01:49:18,369
We thought that...

1418
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:19,921
if it's a girl...

1419
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:24,286
we'd like to
name her after mom.

1420
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:33,362
She'd like that
very much, Kim.

1421
01:49:46,600 --> 01:49:50,047
<i>Hot nights coming</i>

1422
01:49:54,280 --> 01:49:57,727
<i>Keep the car running</i>

1423
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:05,520
<i>Lavender fingers</i>

1424
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:13,331
<i>Swallow my pollen</i>

1425

<i>Gold, I swam into your spell</i>

1426
01:50:21,200 --> 01:50:24,966
<i>On the rite of God we fell</i>

1427
01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:28,681
<i>You were plush and I laid bare</i>

1428
01:50:28,760 --> 01:50:31,445
<i>You had me howling</i>

1429
01:50:31,560 --> 01:50:36,487
<i>Cold, I fell into your skin</i>

1430
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:41,168
<i>On the night
you led me under your sin</i>

<i>You had me howling</i>

1432
01:50:45,240 --> 01:50:48,164
<i>You had me howling</i>

1433
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:24,651
<i>Golden siren</i>

<i>Under-exposing</i>

1435
01:51:35,640 --> 01:51:40,726
<i>Come lay your weakness down</i>

1436
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:47,607
<i>On the floor in the backseat</i>

1437
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:55,208
<i>Gold, I swam into your spell</i>
