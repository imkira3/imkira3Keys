<i>This is berk,</i>

3
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:17,676
<i>the best kept secret
this side of, well...</i>

4
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:19,578
<i>Anywhere.</i>

5
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,313
<i>Granted, it may
not look like much,</i>

6
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:22,581
<i>but this wet heap of rock</i>

7
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,817
<i>packs more than a few surprises.</i>

8
00:01:30,124 --> 00:01:32,558
<i>Life here is amazing,</i>

9
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,427
<i>just not for the faint of heart.</i>

10
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:38,430
<i>You see, where most folks
enjoy hobbies like whittling</i>

11
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:41,600
<i>or needlepoint,
we berkians prefer...</i>

12
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,405
<i>...a little something
we like to call...</i>

13
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:51,243
<i>...dragon racing!</i>

14
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:04,590
Whoa-ho-ho!
Ho-ho!

15
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:07,893
I'm sorry, fishlegs,
did you want that?

16
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:11,630
Oh, snotlout, that was mine!

17
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,232
Here you go, babe.

18
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:15,134
Did I tell you that
you look amazing today?

19
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:16,268
'Cause you do.
Ugh!

20
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,536
Come on, barf.

21
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:19,271
It's starting
to stink around here.

22
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:20,539
Nope, still hates you.

23
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,274
Let's blow this place, belch!

24
00:02:22,276 --> 00:02:23,542
Aah!

25
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:25,477
All right!

26
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,212
Come on!

27
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:32,384
Oh, yeah!

28
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:33,752
Ah, ha-ha!

29
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:35,821
That's nine for the twins!

30
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:38,157
Astrid lags with three!

31
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,827
Fishlegs and snotlout
trail with none!

32
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,695
And hiccup is...

33
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:45,664
Nowhere to be found.

34
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,499
Hmm.

35
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:51,203
Scared him off with the big
talk, didn't you, stoick?

36
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,939
What are you doing, snotlout?

37
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:55,641
They're gonna win now.

38
00:02:55,643 --> 00:02:58,310
She's my princess... whatever
she wants, she gets.

39
00:02:58,312 --> 00:03:01,213
Ruffnut? Didn't she try
to bury you alive?

40
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:03,582
Only for a few hours.

41
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:05,184
Look at 'em go!

42
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:06,552
<i>Now, dragons used to be</i>

43
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:08,187
<i>a bit of a problem here,</i>

44
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:10,189
<i>but that was five years ago.</i>

45
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:12,324
<i>Now they've all moved in.</i>

46
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:14,693
<i>And, really, why wouldn't they?</i>

47
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,795
<i>We have custom stables,</i>

48
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:18,797
<i>all-you-can-eat
feeding stations,</i>

49
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:21,934
<i>a full-service
dragon wash...</i>

50
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:23,969
<i>Even top-of-the-line
fire prevention,</i>

51
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:26,405
<i>if I do say so myself.</i>

52
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:29,441
Ah, it's time, gobber.

53
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:31,243
Righty-ho.
Last lap!

54
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:37,849
The black sheep!
Come on, stormfly!

55
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:40,786
We can still win this thing!

56
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,522
Come on, barf!
Let's go!

57
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:46,525
Go, meatlug!

58
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:49,394
Let's go, let's go!
Ha-ha!

59
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,763
This is your big moment.

60
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,932
Have a nice flight.

61
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:58,971
Up! Up, up, up, up, up!

62
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,544
Good job, meatlug!

63
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:07,946
Here you go, darling.
Mine's worth ten.

64
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:09,948
Yeah! The black sheep!

65
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:13,819
You guys are fighting
for ruffnut?

66
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:16,255
I'm totally winning!
We're winning together.

67
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,324
Oh, no!

68
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:23,795
Whoo! No one can stop me now!
Except for me.

69
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:25,464
We're attached, genius.

70
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:26,999
Quit trying to steal hey!

71
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:29,568
All my glory!

72
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,503
Get them, Astrid!
It's my glory!

73
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:34,006
Always ruining everything!
No, sheep, no glory!

74
00:04:34,008 --> 00:04:36,642
Gotcha! Ha-ha!

75
00:04:36,644 --> 00:04:38,043
Whoa!
Astrid!

76
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:39,511
Well played!

77
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:43,482
That's my future
daughter-in-law!

78
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:45,751
Whoo-hoo!

79
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,487
Uh, excuse me.

80
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:49,721
Stormfly!

81
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:55,360
Whoa!

82
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:58,497
Aah!

83
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:03,035
That's 13!

84
00:05:03,037 --> 00:05:05,070
Astrid takes the game!

85
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:09,508
<i>Yep, berk is pretty
much perfect.</i>

86
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,910
<i>All of my hard work
has paid off.</i>

87
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:13,745
<i>And it's a good thing, too,</i>

88
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:15,587
<i>because with vikings
on the backs of dragons...</i>

89
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:20,585
<i>...the world
just got a whole lot bigger.</i>

90
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:37,769
Yeah!

91
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:21,646
So, what do you think, bud?

92
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:23,682
You want to give this
another shot?

93
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:26,818
Toothless!
It'll be fine.

94
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:33,058
Ready?

95
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,395
Aah...!

96
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,499
Yeah...!

97
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:42,701
Whoo-hoo!

98
00:06:44,171 --> 00:06:45,837
Yeah!

99
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:54,880
Whoa!

100
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:11,163
Oh...

101
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:16,635
Whoo-hoo!

102
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,537
Whoa!

103
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,773
Yeah!

104
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,708
Whoo!

105
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:27,045
This is amazing!

106
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:29,047
No longer amazing.

107
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:30,081
Toothless!

108
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,085
Oh, no!

109
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:36,755
Oh! Aah!

110
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:42,027
Aah! Whoa!

111
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:53,138
Whoo!

112
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,607
That really came out of nowhere.

113
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:05,517
We-we got to work on
your solo gliding there, bud.

114
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,552
That, uh, locked-up tail

115
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:10,755
makes for some pretty sloppy
rescue maneuvers, hey?

116
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:28,773
Ah!

117
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:31,142
Looks like we found
another one, bud.

118
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:34,613
Oh...!

119
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:37,182
Oh, what, do you
want an apology?

120
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:39,885
Is that why you're pouting,

121
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:41,086
big baby boo?

122
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:43,922
Well, try this on!

123
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:47,626
Oh, you feeling it yet? Huh?

124
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:50,061
Picking up on all
my heartfelt remorse?

125
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:54,599
Ah. Yeah. Oh, come on, come on,

126
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,968
you-you wouldn't hurt
a one-legged...

127
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,270
Uh...

128
00:08:58,272 --> 00:08:59,804
Y-you're right,
you're right.

129
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:01,306
You win. You win.

130
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:03,108
Whoa-whoa-whoa...

131
00:09:03,132 --> 00:09:04,142
He's down!

132
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:06,144
And it's ugly!

133
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:07,746
Dragons and vikings...

134
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:09,147
Enemies again...

135
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:11,583
Locked in combat
to the bitter...

136
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:13,552
Oh...!

137
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:21,026
You know that doesn't wash out.

138
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,186
So, what should we name it?

139
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:50,822
"Itchy armpit" it is.

140
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,325
What do you reckon, bud?

141
00:09:53,327 --> 00:09:56,194
Think we might find a few
timberjacks in those woods?

142
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:59,297
The odd whispering death
or two in the rocks?

143
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,935
Who knows, maybe
we'll finally track down

144
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,704
another night fury.

145
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,873
Wouldn't that be something.

146
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,909
So, what do you say?

147
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:12,344
Just keep going?

148
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,089
Afternoon, milady.

149
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:28,093
- Where have you been?
- Hi.

150
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:31,363
Oh, winning races.
What else?

151
00:10:31,365 --> 00:10:33,698
The real question is,

152
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,000
where have you been?

153
00:10:35,002 --> 00:10:38,036
Avoiding my dad.
Oh, no.
What happened now?

154
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:40,372
Oh, you're gonna...
You're gonna love this.

155
00:10:40,374 --> 00:10:42,407
I wake up, the sun's shining,

156
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:44,042
terrible terrors are

157
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:45,210
singing on the rooftop,

158
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:46,878
I saunter down to breakfast

159
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,280
thinking all is right
with the world, and I get:

160
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:51,850
"Son, we need to talk."

161
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:54,719
"Not, now, dad.
I got a whole day of goofing off

162
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:55,887
to get started."

163
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:57,656
Okay, first of all,

164
00:10:57,658 --> 00:11:00,258
I-I don't sound like that.
What is this character?

165
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,260
And-and second...

166
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:04,696
What is that thing you're
doing with my shoulders?

167
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:08,033
Yeah, that's-that's a really
flattering impersonation.

168
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:10,001
Anyway, he goes...

169
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,170
"You're the pride of berk, son,

170
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:15,440
and I couldn't be prouder."
Aw, thanks, dad.

171
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:18,276
I'm pretty impressed
with myself, too.

172
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:21,246
When have I ever
done that with my hands?

173
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:22,881
You just did!

174
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:24,816
Okay, just...

175
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:26,217
Hold... still.

176
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:29,854
Very serious.
Mm-hmm.

177
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:33,425
"You're all grown up,

178
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:36,261
"and since no chief could ask
for a better successor,

179
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:38,930
I've decided..."
To make you chief!
Oh, my gods!

180
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:41,099
Hiccup, that's amazing!

181
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:42,701
Oh...!

182
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:45,003
Y-you're gonna wear
out the spring coil.

183
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:47,305
The calibration
is very sensitive.

184
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:54,913
Yeah, so... this is

185
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:56,781
what I'm dealing with.

186
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:58,049
What did you tell him?

187
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,417
I-I didn't.

188
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:01,019
By the time he turned
around, I was gone.

189
00:12:01,043 --> 00:12:02,187
Huh.

190
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:05,990
Well... it's a lot
of responsibility.

191
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:08,293
The map will have
to wait, for sure,

192
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:09,928
and... and I'll need

193
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,831
to fly toothless, since
you'll be too busy, but...

194
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:18,336
I-it's not me, Astrid.

195
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:21,506
All those speeches and planning
and running the village,

196
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:23,141
that's his thing.

197
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:25,343
I think you're
missing the point.

198
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:26,945
I mean... chief.

199
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:28,379
What an honor!

200
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:29,948
I'd be pretty excited.

201
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,851
I-I... I'm not like you.

202
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:35,120
You... know exactly
who you are,

203
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:37,455
you always have, but...

204
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:39,491
I'm still looking.

205
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:42,260
I know that I'm not my father,

206
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:45,296
and I never met my mother, so...

207
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:47,432
What does that make me?

208
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:57,375
What you're searching for
isn't out there, hiccup...

209
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:59,944
It's in here.

210
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:03,081
Maybe you just don't see it yet.

211
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,116
Ugh. Ugh!
Maybe.

212
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,918
But, you know...

213
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,788
There is something out there.

214
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,489
Hiccup...

215
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,453
Wow...

216
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,593
Stay close.

217
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:02,574
What happened here?

218
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:10,081
All right, e-easy, bud.

219
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,449
Hiccup!

220
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:14,118
Fire!
Astrid, look out!

221
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:19,090
Aah! Hiccup!

222
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,396
Watch the tail!

223
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:29,033
Tie those legs up!

224
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,370
Huh?

225
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:35,440
- Is that what I think it is?
- Stop!

226
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:37,175
Stormfly!

227
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:38,610
What are you doing?!

228
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:40,278
Ooh!

229
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,447
Back again!

230
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:46,384
Soil my britches.

231
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,187
That is a night fury.

232
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:51,289
Thought they were
all gone for good.

233
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,024
Looks like our luck's had a turn

234
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,392
for the better, lads!

235
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,361
Don't think drago
has one of those...

236
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:58,196
In his dragon army.

237
00:14:58,198 --> 00:14:59,497
Dragon army?

238
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:01,499
Look, we don't want any trouble.

239
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:03,935
Hah! You should
have thought of that

240
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:06,404
before you stole
all of our dragons

241
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:07,972
and blasted our fort to bits!

242
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:09,674
- That's right!
- Yeah, look it at!

243
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:11,109
Wait.

244
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:12,343
What are you talking about?

245
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:13,978
You think we did this?

246
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,582
Hah! Dragon trapping is
hard enough work as it is

247
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:20,018
without do-gooder dragon riders

248
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,988
sneaking in to rescue them.
What do-gooder...?

249
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,658
There are other dragon riders?
You mean

250
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,560
other than your thieving friend
from last night? You tell me.

251
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:31,029
You may have

252
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:32,664
an ice-spitting dragon
on your side,

253
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:35,233
but we still have
a quota to fill.

254
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:37,468
How do you suppose
we explain this mess

255
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,003
to drago bludvist?

256
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:40,505
Drago what-fist?

257
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:42,507
Does anything you
say make sense?

258
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:44,342
He's expecting
a new shipment of dragons

259
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:46,544
for his army by tomorrow.

260
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:50,248
And drago don't
take well to excuses!

261
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,083
This is what he gave me

262
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:54,452
last time I showed up
empty-handed.

263
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:58,556
He promised to be far less
understanding in the future.

264
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:01,426
All right, look, we don't know
anything about a dragon thief

265
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:02,694
or an ice-spitting dragon

266
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:04,696
or your lunatic boss

267
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:07,131
and his dragon army, okay?

268
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:10,234
Just give us back our dragon,
and we'll go...

269
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:13,037
Strange, hostile person
whom we've never met.

270
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:15,039
Oh, where are my manners?

271
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,441
I'm eret...

272
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:19,243
Son of eret.

273
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:21,512
Finest dragon trapper alive.

274
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,314
Yeah.
After all...

275
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:27,285
It's not just anyone
who can capture a night fury.

276
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:29,320
And this is toothless.

277
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,589
He says we're going. Now.

278
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:32,724
Hah!

279
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:34,325
They all say that.

280
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,593
Rush 'em, lads!

281
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,068
Stormfly, come on!

282
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,336
Go! Go!

283
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,341
You will

284
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,210
never hold on to those dragons!

285
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:53,511
You hear me?!

286
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:56,280
Drago is coming for them all!

287
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:02,553
Come on, meatlug!
Whoo-hoo!
Yahoo!

288
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,597
Hey there, stoick!
Hey, how are you?

289
00:17:12,621 --> 00:17:13,765
Beautiful day.

290
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:16,067
Hello, spitelout. Great race.
Yeah...

291
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,635
Oh! Sorry, Mrs. ack.

292
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:20,338
Any sign of him?
Eh! He's probably flown

293
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,640
off the edge
of the world by now.

294
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:25,109
You sure you want that kid
running the village?

295
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:27,211
You can still delay
your retirement.

296
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,781
Oh, he's ready.
You'll see.

297
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:32,383
There he is!

298
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:35,053
Huh?
The pride of berk!

299
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:39,657
Who finally decided
to show up for work. Yay.

300
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:41,426
Sorry, got held up.
Hey, uh, dad,

301
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:42,760
could I have a word?

302
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:44,429
Something you're
itching to tell me?

303
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:47,465
Uh, not quite the itch
you're thinking of, but, yes.

304
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:48,666
Oh, good man!

305
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:50,701
Now, lesson one:
A chief's first duty

306
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:52,070
is to his people,

307
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:53,404
so... 41!

308
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,273
Well, can we just
talk in private for...

309
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:56,307
- Forty...
- That's me!

310
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:57,542
That's me! I'm next!

311
00:17:57,544 --> 00:17:58,744
Hey, I was ahead of you!

312
00:17:58,768 --> 00:18:00,111
If we could just talk...

313
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:02,180
Excuse me.
I've been here all day.

314
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:04,549
Okay, okay, I want one
of those high seaters

315
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:07,819
with lots of spikes and a
big storage compartment!

316
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:11,322
Absolutely! You got it, sir.
Dad, this is actually

317
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:13,125
a little more important
than building saddles.

318
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:15,293
Ah, lesson two:
No task is too small

319
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:17,195
when it comes
to serving your people.

320
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:19,297
But, dad...
Oh, excuse us, grump.

321
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:21,599
Can we just talk...
Yah! Grump!

322
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,835
You let the forge
die down again!

323
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,674
Ah...

324
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:31,836
That's it, grump!
You're going up for adoption.

325
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,311
Okay, uh...
There you go.

326
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:35,580
Dad... yeah, but seriously,
go on. Have away.

327
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:40,118
I really need to tell you about
this new land we came across.

328
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,786
Another one?
Any new dragons?

329
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,654
We didn't stick
around to find out.

330
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:46,424
These folks weren't
particularly friendly.

331
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:47,592
Oh, really?

332
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:49,360
Your night fury
and deadly nadder

333
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:51,829
didn't bring them
cheering to the rooftops?

334
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:53,364
No, this was different.

335
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:55,333
Not the standard
run-for-the-hills hoo-ha

336
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:56,667
I've come to enjoy.

337
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:59,604
These guys were trappers.

338
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:01,372
Dragon trappers.

339
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:02,807
You should have seen their fort.

340
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:05,810
All blown apart and stuck
in giant spikes of ice.

341
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,278
It was weird.

342
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,880
I've never seen
anything like it.

343
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:11,549
A-and worst of all,
they thought we did it!

344
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:14,385
You know, you two are gonna get
yourselves in serious trouble

345
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:15,720
one of these days.

346
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:18,890
Not everyone appreciates
this way of life.

347
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:20,191
Aye, gobber's right, son.

348
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:21,859
Best we keep to our own.

349
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:24,929
Besides, you'll have more
important uses for your time.

350
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:26,764
Huh-huh?

351
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:29,667
Once we make
the big announcement!

352
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,670
They are building a dragon army.

353
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:37,708
Or-or at least the guy
they work for is. Uh...

354
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,545
"Dargo... bloody fist"
or something.

355
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:44,549
I'll bloody his
fist with my face

356
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:46,617
if he tries to take my dragon!

357
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:47,652
Or mine!

358
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:49,387
Ugh! You're such a moron.

359
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:50,655
A beautiful moron.

360
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:52,190
Yeah.

361
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:55,359
Bludvist? Drago bludvist?

362
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,195
Uh, yeah. Wait...

363
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:58,729
You know him?

364
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,801
- Ground all dragons!
- What? Why?

365
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:05,670
Seal the gates!

366
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:07,805
Lower the storm doors!
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait, wait.

367
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,373
- What is happening?
- Come on!

368
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,741
You heard the man!
Lock it down!

369
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:14,445
No dragon or viking

370
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:17,648
sets foot off this island
until I give the word!

371
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,770
Wait, because some guy you knew
is stirring up trouble

372
00:20:19,794 --> 00:20:20,985
in some faraway land?

373
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:23,921
Because drago bludvist
is a madman

374
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:26,357
without conscience or mercy.

375
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,259
And if he's built a dragon army,

376
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:29,827
gods help us all.

377
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:30,995
Get them into their pens!

378
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:32,730
Quickly!
Aye, stoick.

379
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,665
Then let's ride back out there.

380
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,667
We'll follow those
trappers to drago

381
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:38,469
and talk some sense into him.

382
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:39,937
No. We fortify the island.

383
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:41,973
It's our duty to keep the peace.

384
00:20:41,975 --> 00:20:43,708
Peace is over, hiccup.

385
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,711
I must prepare you for war.
War?

386
00:20:46,713 --> 00:20:48,980
Dad, if drago's
coming for our dragons,

387
00:20:48,982 --> 00:20:51,849
we can't wait around
for him to get here.

388
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:55,319
Let's go find him
and change his mind.

389
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:57,321
No, some minds
won't be changed, hiccup.

390
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:59,724
Berk is what you need
to worry about.

391
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:02,293
A chief protects his own.

392
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,264
Secure the stables!
Latch every stall!

393
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:08,266
Hiccup, don't.
I have to.

394
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:09,600
This way!

395
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:10,801
Quickly!

396
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:14,005
Hiccup!

397
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:16,841
Come on!

398
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,311
Hiccup!
Aah!

399
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:32,356
Keep your eyes peeled, lads!

400
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:35,393
With this wind,
we'll reach drago by daybreak.

401
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:38,763
So best we fill this ship up
with dragons, and quick!

402
00:21:38,765 --> 00:21:40,364
It's no time to be picky!

403
00:21:40,366 --> 00:21:41,632
Uh, eret?

404
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,868
Not if we want to keep our...

405
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:46,637
...heads!

406
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,572
Off the port quarter!

407
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:50,775
Net them, lads!
Take them down!

408
00:21:50,777 --> 00:21:53,311
There's two of them!
Up on the left!

409
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:56,414
You're not
getting away this time.

410
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:57,581
Fire!

411
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,583
Reload!
Reload!

412
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:02,753
Come on, reload!
Incoming!

413
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:03,988
Steady yourselves, mates.

414
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,357
And here I was,

415
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:08,659
worried we might turn up
empty-handed.

416
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,695
Nope.
It's your lucky day.

417
00:22:10,697 --> 00:22:12,029
We give up.

418
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:15,099
That's one night fury,

419
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:17,802
uh, one deadly nadder, and...

420
00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:20,838
Two of the finest dragon
riders west of luk tuk.

421
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,640
That ought to make the boss
happy, right?

422
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,409
Excuse us.

423
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:26,644
What are you doing?

424
00:22:26,646 --> 00:22:28,346
Toothless, stay.

425
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:31,682
Uh, the dragons
don't really care

426
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:34,085
for cramped spaces, so they'll
just hang out with you.

427
00:22:34,087 --> 00:22:35,686
They won't be any trouble.

428
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:39,023
Unless you do that.

429
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:41,492
You know, wooden boats,
big ocean...

430
00:22:41,494 --> 00:22:43,361
H-how is your swimming?

431
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:44,795
Not good.

432
00:22:45,832 --> 00:22:47,798
Oops. Almost forget.

433
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,101
Can't have armed prisoners.
Give me that.

434
00:22:50,103 --> 00:22:51,836
How is this a plan?

435
00:22:51,838 --> 00:22:54,772
Just what every
dragon trapper needs.

436
00:22:54,774 --> 00:22:58,109
One end coats the blade
in monstrous nightmare saliva.

437
00:22:58,111 --> 00:23:00,878
The other sprays
hideous zippleback gas.

438
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,748
All it takes is a spark, and...

439
00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:06,417
Oh, yeah, there you go.

440
00:23:07,854 --> 00:23:09,854
Once they see you
as one of their own,

441
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:11,456
even the testiest dragons
can be trained.

442
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,423
Right, bud?

443
00:23:12,425 --> 00:23:15,459
Give me that!

444
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:17,461
What game are you playing?

445
00:23:17,463 --> 00:23:19,730
Uh, no game.
We just want to meet drago.

446
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,465
Why?

447
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:23,934
Because I'm going to change
his mind about dragons.

448
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:29,807
He can be really persuasive.

449
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:31,475
Once you've earned his loyalty,

450
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:34,011
there is nothing a dragon
won't do for you.

451
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:37,481
You won't be changing
any minds around here.

452
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:40,885
I can change yours,
right here, right now.

453
00:23:43,055 --> 00:23:44,722
Uh, may I?

454
00:23:44,724 --> 00:23:45,856
Waah!

455
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:50,728
- Watch it!
- Dragon riders!

456
00:23:58,137 --> 00:23:59,537
Put me down!

457
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:01,605
Snotlout,
what-what are you doing?

458
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,541
See how well I protect
and provide?

459
00:24:04,744 --> 00:24:06,104
What is with all the nets?

460
00:24:06,128 --> 00:24:07,711
Hey, watch it! That was...

461
00:24:07,713 --> 00:24:10,014
Close.

462
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:15,119
Oh, my.

463
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:20,090
Me likey.

464
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:25,996
Take me.

465
00:24:29,035 --> 00:24:30,234
Hold your fire!

466
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:37,007
Um, what are you guys
doing here?

467
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:39,176
We're here to rescue you!

468
00:24:39,178 --> 00:24:40,945
I don't need to be rescued.

469
00:24:40,947 --> 00:24:42,780
Enough!

470
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:46,183
Well, didn't you just pick

471
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:47,985
the wrong ship, eh?

472
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,820
I am eret, son of...

473
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:50,822
Eret...

474
00:24:52,258 --> 00:24:53,624
I...

475
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:57,161
Get this thing off me.

476
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:58,829
Anyone else?

477
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,698
Hmm, that's what I figured.

478
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,800
You, saddle up.

479
00:25:02,802 --> 00:25:04,001
We're going home.

480
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:06,036
No.

481
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:07,938
Of all the irresponsible...

482
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,908
I'm trying to protect
our dragons and stop a war.

483
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,142
How is that irresponsible?

484
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:14,778
Because war
is what he wants, son!

485
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:23,721
Years ago, there was
a great gathering of chieftains

486
00:25:23,723 --> 00:25:26,257
<i>to discuss the dragon scourge
we all faced.</i>

487
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:30,794
<i>Into our midst came a stranger
from a strange land,</i>

488
00:25:30,796 --> 00:25:34,565
<i>covered in scars and draped
in a cloak of dragon skin.</i>

489
00:25:35,635 --> 00:25:37,234
<i>He carried no weapon</i>

490
00:25:37,236 --> 00:25:38,936
<i>and spoke softly,</i>

491
00:25:38,938 --> 00:25:40,271
<i>saying that he,</i>

492
00:25:40,273 --> 00:25:42,640
<i>drago bludvist,</i>

493
00:25:42,642 --> 00:25:44,708
<i>was a man of the people,</i>

494
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:49,280
<i>devoted to freeing mankind
from the tyranny of dragons.</i>

495
00:25:49,282 --> 00:25:51,749
<i>He claimed that he alone
could control the dragons,</i>

496
00:25:51,751 --> 00:25:54,118
<i>and that he alone
could keep us safe,</i>

497
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,254
<i>if we chose to bow down</i>

498
00:25:57,256 --> 00:26:00,791
<i>and follow him.</i>

499
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,628
Stupid.
Ah, good one.

500
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:06,830
Aye, we laughed, too...

501
00:26:06,832 --> 00:26:08,272
<i>Until he wrapped himself
in his cloak</i>

502
00:26:08,296 --> 00:26:09,767
<i>and cried out,</i>

503
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:11,635
<i>"then see how well you do
without me!"</i>

504
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:13,237
...See how well
you do without me!

505
00:26:13,261 --> 00:26:16,206
<i>The rooftop suddenly burst
into flames,</i>

506
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:20,010
<i>and from it,
armored dragons descended,</i>

507
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:23,147
<i>burning the hall to the ground.</i>

508
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:25,983
I...

509
00:26:25,985 --> 00:26:28,619
Was the only one to escape.

510
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:37,194
Men who kill without reason
cannot be reasoned with.

511
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:39,063
Maybe.
Hiccup!

512
00:26:39,065 --> 00:26:41,131
I'm still going to try.

513
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,802
This is what I'm good at,

514
00:26:44,804 --> 00:26:46,804
and-and if I could change
your mind,

515
00:26:46,806 --> 00:26:49,273
I can change his, too.

516
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:52,309
Come on.

517
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:54,678
Let's go.
No!

518
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,614
Lead the others back to berk.

519
00:26:56,616 --> 00:26:59,049
I've had enough mutiny
for one day.

520
00:27:01,354 --> 00:27:03,120
Ooh, I like that.

521
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:04,888
Ruffnut!

522
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,724
Okay!

523
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:09,727
Ah.

524
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:28,979
Don't worry, bud.

525
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:31,949
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

526
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:34,652
I promise.

527
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:43,961
Aw, come on, dad.

528
00:27:43,963 --> 00:27:45,663
Really?

529
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,406
Okay.

530
00:27:55,408 --> 00:27:57,408
No sudden moves.

531
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:23,133
Hold on, hold on.

532
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:37,414
Toothless...!

533
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:27,097
Hey!

534
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,866
You left my dragon back there!

535
00:29:28,868 --> 00:29:31,301
He can't fly on his own!
He'll drown!

536
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,793
Hey! Uh...

537
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:57,828
We have to head back
for my dragon!

538
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:46,009
Who are you?

539
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:48,879
The dragon thief?

540
00:30:48,881 --> 00:30:50,314
Uh...

541
00:30:50,316 --> 00:30:52,583
Drago bludvist?

542
00:30:52,585 --> 00:30:54,484
Do you even understand

543
00:30:54,486 --> 00:30:56,486
what I'm saying?

544
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:03,227
Toothless!

545
00:31:03,229 --> 00:31:06,029
Oh, it's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

546
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:08,131
I'm glad to see you, too, bud.

547
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:09,413
You really had me worried there.

548
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,538
Uh, uh...

549
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:56,179
Oh...

550
00:31:56,181 --> 00:31:57,481
Hiccup?

551
00:31:57,483 --> 00:31:59,383
Uh...

552
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:03,654
C-could it be?

553
00:32:03,656 --> 00:32:06,990
After all these years?

554
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:09,493
How is this possible?

555
00:32:09,495 --> 00:32:12,129
Uh, should I...

556
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:13,463
Should I know you?

557
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:15,632
No.

558
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:17,334
You were only a babe.

559
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:25,442
But a mother never forgets.

560
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:31,148
Shh, shh.

561
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:35,352
Come.

562
00:32:35,354 --> 00:32:37,187
Boar-headed!

563
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:38,522
Just like his mother!

564
00:32:38,524 --> 00:32:40,524
Aye, she could never
stay put, either.

565
00:32:40,526 --> 00:32:41,591
Eh, he's just 20,

566
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:43,160
and a viking.

567
00:32:43,162 --> 00:32:44,842
I mean, could there be
a worse combination?

568
00:32:44,866 --> 00:32:48,131
Heh! When I think
of how stubborn and senseless

569
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:50,567
you were back in the day.

570
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:52,269
Oh.

571
00:32:52,271 --> 00:32:55,005
Well, not much
has changed, actually.

572
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:58,241
Ah, you know what he's like.

573
00:32:58,243 --> 00:33:00,110
He won't give up, gobber.

574
00:33:00,112 --> 00:33:02,713
And if hiccup finds drago

575
00:33:02,715 --> 00:33:05,048
before we find him...

576
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,583
Ah!
Nothing can hurt hiccup,

577
00:33:06,585 --> 00:33:08,719
so long as that
night fury's around.

578
00:33:08,721 --> 00:33:10,187
It's a night fury!

579
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:16,259
Huh?

580
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:31,441
Find them, skullcrusher.

581
00:33:33,145 --> 00:33:34,478
Find them.

582
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:43,687
Uh, h-hold on.
Wait just a minute.

583
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:45,088
This way.
Come back here.

584
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,723
Come.
You can't just say

585
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:49,026
something like that and run off.

586
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:50,494
You're my mother?!

587
00:33:50,496 --> 00:33:52,095
I mean, what the...?

588
00:33:52,097 --> 00:33:54,131
Do you... do you grasp how
insane it sounds?

589
00:33:54,133 --> 00:33:55,365
Come quickly.

590
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:56,533
I have questions!

591
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:58,402
Where have you...

592
00:33:58,404 --> 00:34:00,404
Been all this time?

593
00:34:01,573 --> 00:34:03,407
What-what have you been doing?

594
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:06,343
But they-they said
you were dead!

595
00:34:06,345 --> 00:34:08,678
Everyone thinks
you were eaten by...

596
00:34:49,154 --> 00:34:52,789
This is where you've been
for 20 years?

597
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,794
You-you've been rescuing them.

598
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,632
Unbelievable.

599
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:04,367
You're not upset?
What?

600
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:06,169
No. I-I don't know. I...

601
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:08,839
It's a bit much to get
my head around, to be Frank.

602
00:35:08,841 --> 00:35:11,708
It's not every day you find out
your mother

603
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:15,879
is some kind of crazy, feral,
vigilante dragon lady.

604
00:35:15,881 --> 00:35:18,281
Oh...

605
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:19,883
Well...

606
00:35:19,885 --> 00:35:23,453
At least I'm not boring, right?

607
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,222
Well, I suppose there is that...

608
00:35:25,224 --> 00:35:28,325
One specific thing.

609
00:35:28,327 --> 00:35:30,160
Do-do you like it?

610
00:35:30,162 --> 00:35:31,228
I...

611
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,496
I... I...

612
00:35:32,498 --> 00:35:34,464
I-I don't have the words.

613
00:35:42,407 --> 00:35:44,608
C-can I...

614
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:46,877
Oh, he's beautiful.

615
00:35:46,879 --> 00:35:48,478
Oh.

616
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:51,314
Oh, incredible.

617
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:55,886
He might very well be
the last of his kind.

618
00:35:55,888 --> 00:35:58,355
Oh... and look,

619
00:35:58,357 --> 00:35:59,890
he's your age.

620
00:35:59,892 --> 00:36:01,291
Wow.

621
00:36:01,293 --> 00:36:03,160
No wonder you get along so well.

622
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:04,494
Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah?

623
00:36:06,365 --> 00:36:08,899
And retractable teeth.

624
00:36:08,901 --> 00:36:11,201
How did you manage...

625
00:36:11,203 --> 00:36:12,736
I found him in the woods.

626
00:36:12,738 --> 00:36:16,306
He was shot down and wounded.

627
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:22,679
This snafflefang lost his leg

628
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:25,382
to one of drago bludvist's
iron traps.

629
00:36:25,384 --> 00:36:26,850
This raincutter

630
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:29,219
had her wing sliced
by razor netting.

631
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:31,588
And this, oh, poor hobblegrunt

632
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:34,491
was blinded by a tree snare

633
00:36:34,493 --> 00:36:37,727
and then left to die alone
and scared.

634
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:39,796
And what of this?

635
00:36:39,798 --> 00:36:42,799
Did drago or his trappers
do this, too?

636
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:44,334
Oh.

637
00:36:44,336 --> 00:36:45,835
Yeah.

638
00:36:45,837 --> 00:36:49,573
Well, crazy thing is...

639
00:36:49,575 --> 00:36:53,510
I'm actually the one
who shot him down.

640
00:36:53,512 --> 00:36:56,279
Hey, it's-it's okay, though.

641
00:36:56,281 --> 00:36:57,347
He got me back.

642
00:36:57,349 --> 00:36:58,748
Right, bud?

643
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,717
You couldn't save
all of me, could you?

644
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,485
You just had to make it even.

645
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:05,355
So peg leg.

646
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:10,460
Uh...

647
00:37:10,462 --> 00:37:12,963
What did your father think
of your night fury friend?

648
00:37:12,965 --> 00:37:15,999
Oh, he-he didn't take
it all that well.

649
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:19,869
But then, he changed.

650
00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:21,004
They all did.

651
00:37:21,006 --> 00:37:22,606
Pretty soon,

652
00:37:22,608 --> 00:37:25,442
everyone back home had
dragons of their own.

653
00:37:25,444 --> 00:37:27,644
If only it were possible.

654
00:37:27,646 --> 00:37:28,745
No, really.

655
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:30,814
Believe me, I tried, as well,

656
00:37:30,816 --> 00:37:33,850
but people are not capable
of change, hiccup.

657
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:35,385
Some of us...

658
00:37:35,387 --> 00:37:37,654
Were just born different.

659
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:46,863
<i>Berk was a land of kill</i>

660
00:37:46,865 --> 00:37:48,431
<i>or be killed,</i>

661
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:51,401
<i>but I believed peace
was possible.</i>

662
00:37:52,671 --> 00:37:55,672
Stop!
You'll only make it worse!

663
00:37:55,674 --> 00:37:59,342
<i>It was a very unpopular opinion.</i>

664
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,512
Hiccup!

665
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:04,314
<i>Then one night,</i>

666
00:38:04,316 --> 00:38:07,417
<i>a dragon broke into our
house, finding you</i>

667
00:38:07,419 --> 00:38:08,985
<i>in the cradle.</i>

668
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:12,355
<i>I rushed to protect you.</i>

669
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:21,331
<i>But what I saw was proof
of everything I believed.</i>

670
00:38:34,046 --> 00:38:36,746
<i>This wasn't a vicious beast,</i>

671
00:38:36,748 --> 00:38:39,683
<i>but an intelligent,
gentle creature,</i>

672
00:38:39,685 --> 00:38:43,386
<i>whose soul reflected my own.</i>

673
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:48,391
Valka, run!
No, don't.

674
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:52,896
Oh...

675
00:38:52,898 --> 00:38:54,064
Hold on!

676
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:58,101
No! Aah! Stoick!

677
00:38:58,103 --> 00:39:00,470
Valka!

678
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:04,074
Stoick!

679
00:39:04,076 --> 00:39:06,810
Valka.

680
00:39:06,812 --> 00:39:10,080
<i>You and your father nearly died</i>

681
00:39:10,082 --> 00:39:11,681
that night.

682
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:14,684
All because
I couldn't kill a dragon.

683
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:17,887
Eh, runs in the family.

684
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:19,956
It broke my heart to stay away,

685
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:23,426
but I believed
you'd be safer if I did.

686
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:26,563
How did you survive?

687
00:39:26,565 --> 00:39:28,832
Oh, cloudjumper never meant
to harm me.

688
00:39:28,834 --> 00:39:32,969
He must have thought
I belonged here

689
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:36,906
in the home of the
great bewilderbeast.

690
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,110
The Alpha species.

691
00:39:40,112 --> 00:39:41,978
One of the very few

692
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,947
that still exist.

693
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:47,684
Every nest has its queen,

694
00:39:47,686 --> 00:39:51,121
but this is the king
of all dragons.

695
00:39:51,123 --> 00:39:53,523
With his icy breath,

696
00:39:53,525 --> 00:39:56,126
this graceful giant
built our nest,

697
00:39:56,128 --> 00:39:59,562
a safe haven for
dragons everywhere.

698
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:01,865
Wait, that's the ice-spitter?

699
00:40:01,867 --> 00:40:03,733
He's responsible

700
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:04,901
for all that destruction?

701
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:06,770
He protects us.

702
00:40:06,772 --> 00:40:09,105
We all live under his care

703
00:40:09,107 --> 00:40:10,940
and his command.

704
00:40:13,879 --> 00:40:16,012
All but the babies, of course...

705
00:40:18,884 --> 00:40:20,617
...who listen to no one.

706
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,555
Aw...

707
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:36,533
I've lived among them
for 20 years, hiccup,

708
00:40:36,535 --> 00:40:39,135
discovering their secrets.

709
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:44,674
He likes you.

710
00:40:44,676 --> 00:40:46,176
Wow.

711
00:40:46,178 --> 00:40:47,710
You must be hungry.

712
00:40:47,712 --> 00:40:49,479
Uh, yeah, I could eat.

713
00:40:49,481 --> 00:40:50,481
Good.

714
00:40:50,482 --> 00:40:51,881
It's feeding time.

715
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:02,625
I don't like it.

716
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:04,761
They should've been back
with hiccup by now.

717
00:41:04,763 --> 00:41:05,929
I don't like it, either.

718
00:41:05,931 --> 00:41:07,131
Eret, son of eret,

719
00:41:07,155 --> 00:41:08,798
was the man of my dreams.

720
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,200
My everything!

721
00:41:10,202 --> 00:41:12,669
But, baby,
I grew facial hair for you.

722
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:14,604
Me, too.

723
00:41:14,606 --> 00:41:16,105
What if drago shot them down?

724
00:41:16,107 --> 00:41:18,808
What if they need our help?

725
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,577
We have to find them.

726
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:21,611
Wait, wait, what?

727
00:41:21,613 --> 00:41:22,779
No, but stoick said...

728
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:24,013
It doesn't matter what he said

729
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:25,215
if they've all been captured.

730
00:41:25,217 --> 00:41:26,583
Come on!

731
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:31,688
Do we go back?

732
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:32,956
We've nowhere to go,

733
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:34,958
nothing to sell, and no heads

734
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,226
to call our own.

735
00:41:36,228 --> 00:41:37,861
Uh, eret...?
If we don't turn up

736
00:41:37,863 --> 00:41:40,230
with dragons and fast...

737
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:43,766
Careful what you wish for!

738
00:41:43,768 --> 00:41:45,535
Do something!
Eret, son of eret!

739
00:41:45,537 --> 00:41:46,537
We'll miss you, eret!

740
00:41:46,538 --> 00:41:47,538
What is this?

741
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:48,705
A kidnapping.

742
00:41:48,707 --> 00:41:50,240
Yay, can he ride with me?
Can he?

743
00:41:50,242 --> 00:41:51,541
Can he...?

744
00:41:52,911 --> 00:41:54,911
You're gonna show us
the way to drago.

745
00:41:54,913 --> 00:41:56,579
And help dragon riders

746
00:41:56,581 --> 00:41:58,081
sneak into drago's camp?

747
00:41:58,083 --> 00:41:59,148
Just kill me now.

748
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,250
That could be arranged.

749
00:42:00,252 --> 00:42:01,918
Stormfly, drop it.

750
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,586
Huh?

751
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:05,855
Good girl!

752
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:08,892
Stormfly, fetch.

753
00:42:09,895 --> 00:42:10,994
All right!

754
00:42:10,996 --> 00:42:13,963
Okay! I'll take you to drago!

755
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,600
Works every time.

756
00:42:25,777 --> 00:42:28,278
Hey, I-I thought
we were going to eat.

757
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,046
Oh, we are.

758
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:04,113
And then, from dragon island,
I found this archipelago...

759
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:12,922
There.

760
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:15,658
Whoa.

761
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,110
Oh, when I'm up here,

762
00:44:07,112 --> 00:44:08,978
I don't even feel the cold.

763
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,346
I just feel...

764
00:44:10,348 --> 00:44:12,682
Free.

765
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,387
This is what it is

766
00:44:17,389 --> 00:44:20,657
to be a dragon, hiccup.

767
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:22,725
It's all well and good

768
00:44:22,727 --> 00:44:23,960
to call yourself a dragon,

769
00:44:23,962 --> 00:44:25,194
but can you fly?

770
00:44:46,785 --> 00:44:48,251
Oh, no! Aah!

771
00:44:58,763 --> 00:45:00,430
Man, almost!

772
00:45:00,432 --> 00:45:02,765
We just about had it that time.

773
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:09,305
Incredible.

774
00:45:09,307 --> 00:45:11,741
Well, not bad yourself.

775
00:45:22,252 --> 00:45:25,822
All this time,
you took after me.

776
00:45:25,824 --> 00:45:27,724
And...

777
00:45:27,726 --> 00:45:29,492
Where was I?

778
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,995
I'm so sorry, hiccup.

779
00:45:32,997 --> 00:45:35,965
Can we start over?

780
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:41,904
Will you give me another chance?

781
00:45:44,374 --> 00:45:46,909
I-I can teach you
all that I've learned

782
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:49,912
these past 20 years.

783
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:51,414
Like...

784
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:57,053
Wow.

785
00:45:57,055 --> 00:45:59,322
Now you can make
those tight turns.

786
00:46:01,226 --> 00:46:03,493
Did you know about this?

787
00:46:03,495 --> 00:46:06,095
Every dragon

788
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:08,331
has its secrets. And...

789
00:46:08,333 --> 00:46:10,366
I'll show them all to you.

790
00:46:10,368 --> 00:46:12,902
We'll unlock every mystery,

791
00:46:12,904 --> 00:46:15,972
find every last species...
together, as mother and son.

792
00:46:22,547 --> 00:46:24,981
This gift we share, hiccup,

793
00:46:24,983 --> 00:46:26,983
it bonds us.

794
00:46:26,985 --> 00:46:31,087
This is who you are, son.

795
00:46:31,089 --> 00:46:32,855
Who we are.

796
00:46:32,857 --> 00:46:36,492
We will change the world
for all dragons.

797
00:46:36,494 --> 00:46:39,295
We will make it a better,
safer place.

798
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:40,897
Yeah, I mean,

799
00:46:40,899 --> 00:46:43,332
that sounds amazing.

800
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:57,380
Oh, this is so great!

801
00:46:57,382 --> 00:47:00,583
Now you and I can go talk
to drago together.

802
00:47:00,585 --> 00:47:02,051
What?

803
00:47:02,053 --> 00:47:04,387
There's no talking to drago.

804
00:47:04,389 --> 00:47:05,888
But we have to...
No.

805
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:08,157
We must protect our own.

806
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:09,258
Come on.

807
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:10,593
We should be getting back.

808
00:47:10,595 --> 00:47:12,562
Hmm?

809
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:27,877
Okay, I got you here!

810
00:47:27,879 --> 00:47:29,212
Now get this thing off me.

811
00:47:29,214 --> 00:47:31,013
Never take a toy from a dragon.

812
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:32,515
Don't you know anything?

813
00:47:33,985 --> 00:47:36,419
Why does this
keep happening to me?

814
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:52,368
What's down there?

815
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:55,504
Large diameter bubbles,

816
00:47:55,506 --> 00:47:57,273
massive lungs,

817
00:47:57,275 --> 00:47:59,508
cold water deep dweller,
I'm thinking

818
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:01,510
class five leviathan,

819
00:48:01,512 --> 00:48:03,145
maybe six.

820
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:08,484
Yah!

821
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:19,795
Meatlug, what's wrong, girl?
Hookfang!
Come on!

822
00:48:19,819 --> 00:48:21,097
Don't move!

823
00:48:21,099 --> 00:48:22,565
Uh...

824
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:38,481
Drago!

825
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:45,021
Get off me!

826
00:48:46,291 --> 00:48:48,491
Always great
to see you, my friend.

827
00:48:48,493 --> 00:48:50,626
Keeping warm up here?

828
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:56,699
Well, as you can see,
I am right on time

829
00:48:56,701 --> 00:48:58,634
with a new batch of dragons,

830
00:48:58,636 --> 00:49:00,036
just like I promised.

831
00:49:00,038 --> 00:49:01,637
He's waking up!
Drop the ropes!

832
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:03,205
Give me some backup here!

833
00:49:03,207 --> 00:49:04,707
Watch out!

834
00:49:04,709 --> 00:49:06,309
Drop the ropes.

835
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:41,077
- Hookfang!
- Hey!

836
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:42,411
What are you doing?!

837
00:49:42,413 --> 00:49:44,180
You belong

838
00:49:44,182 --> 00:49:46,082
to me now.

839
00:49:47,352 --> 00:49:49,518
And as an added bonus,

840
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,121
I also caught you their riders.

841
00:49:52,123 --> 00:49:54,123
No extra charge.
What?

842
00:49:54,125 --> 00:49:55,558
Are you kidding me?
Aw!

843
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,660
But you were so perfect!

844
00:49:57,662 --> 00:50:00,196
Turns out there's a whole bunch
of them out there.

845
00:50:00,198 --> 00:50:02,031
They attacked...

846
00:50:02,033 --> 00:50:03,699
How many?

847
00:50:03,701 --> 00:50:06,402
Drago doesn't have them
after all.

848
00:50:06,404 --> 00:50:07,737
- How many?
- Hundreds.

849
00:50:07,739 --> 00:50:09,338
A whole island full.

850
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,374
I wouldn't worry about it.

851
00:50:11,376 --> 00:50:14,643
My men are
hunting them down as we speak.

852
00:50:14,645 --> 00:50:16,345
They won't know
where you're hiding.

853
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:17,780
I promise you that.

854
00:50:17,782 --> 00:50:20,049
Oh, yes, they will!
They know we're missing,

855
00:50:20,051 --> 00:50:22,118
and they have tracking dragons.

856
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,620
If you so much as touch us,
hiccup is gonna kick...

857
00:50:24,622 --> 00:50:26,589
Hiccup?
He's not a problem.

858
00:50:26,591 --> 00:50:28,657
Really, trust me.

859
00:50:28,659 --> 00:50:31,060
He's only the son
of stoick the vast,

860
00:50:31,062 --> 00:50:33,062
his heir to the throne of berk,

861
00:50:33,064 --> 00:50:36,565
and the greatest dragon master
this world has ever seen.

862
00:50:36,567 --> 00:50:38,601
"Dragon master"?

863
00:50:38,603 --> 00:50:40,669
I alone control

864
00:50:40,671 --> 00:50:42,271
the dragons.

865
00:50:42,273 --> 00:50:44,173
Nope, mm-mm.
Sorry!

866
00:50:44,175 --> 00:50:47,510
And unless you let us go
right now,

867
00:50:47,512 --> 00:50:50,046
he will blast through here
on his night fury

868
00:50:50,048 --> 00:50:52,114
and blow your entire
fleet of ships

869
00:50:52,116 --> 00:50:54,216
to splinters.

870
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:55,684
Then they'll be crying
like babies.

871
00:50:55,686 --> 00:50:57,253
Funny and beautiful.

872
00:50:57,255 --> 00:50:58,587
Good one, babe.
Yeah.

873
00:50:58,589 --> 00:51:01,290
Like babies, they always cry.

874
00:51:01,292 --> 00:51:02,491
Real tiny ones.

875
00:51:02,493 --> 00:51:04,827
First there was one rider,

876
00:51:04,829 --> 00:51:07,496
And now all of berk?

877
00:51:07,498 --> 00:51:10,399
And you led them to me!

878
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:13,169
Drago...!

879
00:51:13,171 --> 00:51:16,172
Stop all preparations!

880
00:51:16,174 --> 00:51:20,209
We must attack
the dragon riders' nest at once!

881
00:51:20,211 --> 00:51:23,579
We will take down their Alpha.

882
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:27,483
Then we will take berk!

883
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:30,319
Drago!

884
00:51:30,321 --> 00:51:31,520
And get rid of him.

885
00:51:31,522 --> 00:51:34,590
Drago, please, I...

886
00:51:40,131 --> 00:51:42,098
Stormfly!

887
00:51:45,403 --> 00:51:47,269
No!

888
00:51:58,181 --> 00:52:00,316
Well, bud...

889
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:03,419
We can't wait around for drago
to attack this place.

890
00:52:03,421 --> 00:52:05,354
We've got to find him first.

891
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:13,596
Let's go.

892
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,500
Easy now.

893
00:52:17,502 --> 00:52:19,568
Are you kidding me?
How did you get in here?

894
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:21,137
The same way we're
getting you out.

895
00:52:21,139 --> 00:52:22,838
"We"?
All clear.

896
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,320
Toothless, come.
Uh, wait, uh, wait...

897
00:52:24,344 --> 00:52:26,475
Okay, uh, dad,
there-there's something

898
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:28,544
you need to know.
Yeah, yeah,
tell me on the way.

899
00:52:28,546 --> 00:52:31,547
Well, this isn't an "on the way"
kind of update, actually.

900
00:52:31,549 --> 00:52:32,748
I've heard enough, hiccup.

901
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:34,416
More-more of
the earth-shattering

902
00:52:34,418 --> 00:52:35,584
development variety.

903
00:52:35,586 --> 00:52:37,219
Yeah, just add it to pile.

904
00:52:37,221 --> 00:52:38,821
Yeah, I, uh, uh,

905
00:52:38,823 --> 00:52:42,191
dad, unlike most surprises
I spring on you,

906
00:52:42,193 --> 00:52:44,493
this is one you'll like,
I promise.

907
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:46,529
You just have to
handle it delicately.

908
00:52:46,531 --> 00:52:48,497
So...

909
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:50,366
Uh...

910
00:52:50,368 --> 00:52:53,536
You might want to take this one.

911
00:52:53,538 --> 00:52:55,337
Huh?

912
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:56,939
Oh, boy.

913
00:52:56,941 --> 00:52:59,708
Oh, uh, dad,

914
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:02,311
could you put
the sword away, please?

915
00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:06,448
Oh.

916
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:17,660
I know what
you're gonna say, stoick.

917
00:53:17,662 --> 00:53:19,929
How could I have done this?

918
00:53:21,399 --> 00:53:23,432
Stayed away all of these years,

919
00:53:23,434 --> 00:53:25,501
and why didn't
I come back to you?

920
00:53:25,503 --> 00:53:27,469
To our son?

921
00:53:27,471 --> 00:53:28,737
Well...

922
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:30,673
What sign did I have

923
00:53:30,675 --> 00:53:32,408
that you could change, stoick?

924
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:34,577
That anyone on berk could?

925
00:53:34,579 --> 00:53:37,713
I pleaded so many times

926
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:39,715
to stop the fighting,
to find another answer,

927
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:41,517
but did any of you listen?

928
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:42,985
This is why I never married.

929
00:53:42,987 --> 00:53:46,255
This, and one other reason.

930
00:53:46,257 --> 00:53:48,457
I know that I left you

931
00:53:48,459 --> 00:53:50,593
to raise hiccup alone,

932
00:53:50,595 --> 00:53:53,629
but I thought he'd be
better off without me,

933
00:53:53,631 --> 00:53:55,231
and I was wrong.

934
00:53:55,233 --> 00:53:56,799
I see that now, but...

935
00:53:56,801 --> 00:53:58,400
Oh!

936
00:53:58,402 --> 00:54:01,270
Stop being so stoic, stoick.

937
00:54:01,272 --> 00:54:03,639
Go on, shout, scream,

938
00:54:03,641 --> 00:54:05,608
say something!

939
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:13,582
You're as beautiful
as the day I lost you.

940
00:54:46,349 --> 00:54:47,683
Move it.

941
00:54:47,685 --> 00:54:48,845
Could this day get any worse?

942
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:50,019
Uh, let me see.

943
00:54:50,021 --> 00:54:51,621
We're gonna jump
into freezing cold water

944
00:54:51,645 --> 00:54:53,055
and then die from drowning.

945
00:54:53,057 --> 00:54:54,757
Looks refreshing.

946
00:54:54,759 --> 00:54:56,959
Please, ladies first.

947
00:54:56,961 --> 00:55:00,462
You are a steaming heap

948
00:55:00,464 --> 00:55:01,730
of dragon...
Duck.

949
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:08,737
Warn the others!
Get them, you son of an eret.

950
00:55:10,374 --> 00:55:11,840
Take that!

951
00:55:18,849 --> 00:55:20,382
Okay, I love you again.

952
00:55:20,384 --> 00:55:22,418
Oh, pathetic.

953
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:23,652
You can still jump.

954
00:55:23,654 --> 00:55:25,421
So, are we going to save
your dragons

955
00:55:25,423 --> 00:55:27,456
and get out of here
or not?
Mm.

956
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:28,957
Check every trap.

957
00:55:28,959 --> 00:55:30,926
They're here somewhere.

958
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:41,437
Meatlug?

959
00:55:42,707 --> 00:55:44,640
Anyone coming?

960
00:55:44,642 --> 00:55:46,682
I don't know, you just keep
doing what you're doing.

961
00:55:46,706 --> 00:55:49,574
Keep cranking.

962
00:56:05,729 --> 00:56:08,964
Thank you for saving my life.

963
00:56:13,137 --> 00:56:15,871
Now let me return the favor.

964
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:17,840
Mom, you'd never
even recognize it.

965
00:56:17,842 --> 00:56:19,042
Where we used to make weapons,

966
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:21,143
we now build saddles,

967
00:56:21,145 --> 00:56:22,678
wing slings...

968
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:24,646
We-we even fix dragon teeth.

969
00:56:24,648 --> 00:56:27,082
You-you wouldn't believe
how much everything's changed.

970
00:56:27,084 --> 00:56:29,385
Aye, your son's changed berk
for the better.

971
00:56:29,387 --> 00:56:31,453
I think we did well
with this one, val.

972
00:56:31,455 --> 00:56:32,621
Thanks, dad.

973
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:35,457
I got it.

974
00:56:35,459 --> 00:56:36,592
I got it.

975
00:56:47,805 --> 00:56:49,438
I'm, uh...

976
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,806
A little out of practice.

977
00:56:50,808 --> 00:56:52,674
Well, you know,

978
00:56:52,676 --> 00:56:54,410
I didn't marry you
for your cooking.

979
00:56:54,412 --> 00:56:55,677
I hope not.

980
00:56:55,679 --> 00:56:57,913
Her meatballs
could kill more beasts

981
00:56:57,915 --> 00:56:59,681
than a battle ax.

982
00:56:59,683 --> 00:57:02,184
I've still got a few knocking
around in here.

983
00:57:02,186 --> 00:57:04,987
And once you move back in
with all your dragons,

984
00:57:04,989 --> 00:57:07,456
old drago won't even
stand a chance.

985
00:57:07,458 --> 00:57:08,891
Everything will be okay.

986
00:57:08,893 --> 00:57:10,592
Slow down, son.

987
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:12,961
It's a lot to take in.

988
00:57:12,963 --> 00:57:15,097
Oh, gotcha.

989
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:25,207
Oh, I love this one.

990
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:42,791

1032
00:59:50,287 --> 00:59:53,288
I thought I'd have to die before
we'd have that dance again.

1033
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:55,090
No need for drastic measures.

1034
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,094
For you, my dear...

1035
00:59:59,096 --> 01:00:00,929
Anything.

1036
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:03,899
Will you come home, val?

1037
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:09,171
Will you be my wife once again?

1038
01:00:13,978 --> 01:00:15,711
We can be a family!

1039
01:00:15,713 --> 01:00:17,112
What do you say?

1040
01:00:17,114 --> 01:00:18,680
Well...

1041
01:00:20,851 --> 01:00:22,718
Yes...

1042
01:00:24,254 --> 01:00:26,388
Great!
I'll do the cooking.

1043
01:00:28,258 --> 01:00:30,726
Thank odin you didn't
listen to me, son.

1044
01:00:30,728 --> 01:00:33,061
We never
would've found each other.

1045
01:00:34,932 --> 01:00:38,100
Toothless?

1046
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:41,870
What's happening?

1047
01:00:58,022 --> 01:00:59,655
Oh...

1048
01:01:00,891 --> 01:01:04,059
Oh, no...

1049
01:01:04,061 --> 01:01:05,661
Val...

1050
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:07,663
Val, it's all right,
it's all right.

1051
01:01:07,665 --> 01:01:09,064
We're a team now.

1052
01:01:09,066 --> 01:01:10,332
Now, what do you want to do?

1053
01:01:10,334 --> 01:01:12,968
We have to save the dragons.

1054
01:01:12,970 --> 01:01:15,303
Aye, you got it.
Come on, son!

1055
01:01:22,713 --> 01:01:24,346
Reload!

1056
01:01:24,348 --> 01:01:25,914
Fire!

1057
01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:32,921
Fire! Fire!

1058
01:01:38,228 --> 01:01:41,196
Whatever comes,
keep hitting the Mountain.

1059
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:44,199
We need to draw the Alpha out.

1060
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:55,711
Ready the traps!

1061
01:02:10,494 --> 01:02:12,761
Surprise!

1062
01:02:12,763 --> 01:02:14,262
Yeah!

1063
01:02:14,264 --> 01:02:15,264
What?!

1064
01:02:15,265 --> 01:02:17,499
Waah! Waah! Oh!

1065
01:02:20,037 --> 01:02:22,337
You really are
full of surprises.

1066
01:02:22,339 --> 01:02:23,939
Let's go.

1067
01:02:23,941 --> 01:02:26,908
Dragon riders coming through!

1068
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:29,277
Fire!

1069
01:02:33,984 --> 01:02:35,817
Oh, yeah!

1070
01:02:35,819 --> 01:02:38,220
Look out!

1071
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:43,225
Cut them down!

1072
01:02:46,263 --> 01:02:47,929
Eret, son of eret!

1073
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:49,798
Aah...!

1074
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:00,776
Up, girl!

1075
01:03:00,778 --> 01:03:02,010
Lean left, eret!

1076
01:03:02,012 --> 01:03:03,145
That's it!

1077
01:03:03,147 --> 01:03:04,913
Look out!

1078
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:15,190
Yeah, baby!

1079
01:03:18,361 --> 01:03:20,529
Take them down!

1080
01:03:20,531 --> 01:03:22,364
Heads up!

1081
01:03:29,372 --> 01:03:31,473
Dragon master.

1082
01:03:31,475 --> 01:03:34,209
Welcome aboard, dragon rider.

1083
01:03:34,211 --> 01:03:35,844
Thanks. I think.

1084
01:03:35,846 --> 01:03:37,445
Where have you been?

1085
01:03:37,447 --> 01:03:40,448
Oh, you know,
catching up with mom.

1086
01:03:52,196 --> 01:03:53,929
That's your mother?!

1087
01:03:53,931 --> 01:03:57,866
Well, now you know
where I get my dramatic flair.

1088
01:04:01,237 --> 01:04:02,871
The Alpha!

1089
01:04:02,873 --> 01:04:05,240
Now we have a fight!

1090
01:04:18,221 --> 01:04:20,488
Come on, toothless.

1091
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:22,858
Show them what you got, bud.

1092
01:04:27,231 --> 01:04:28,630
Attaboy!

1093
01:04:41,612 --> 01:04:44,145
I've waited
a long time for this.

1094
01:04:44,147 --> 01:04:46,514
You cannot take our dragons!

1095
01:04:46,516 --> 01:04:48,250
They are controlled
by the Alpha!

1096
01:04:48,252 --> 01:04:51,186
Then it's a good thing
I brought a challenger.

1097
01:05:14,211 --> 01:05:15,510
Another one?

1098
01:05:15,512 --> 01:05:19,014
That is a class ten! Class ten!

1099
01:05:19,016 --> 01:05:20,215
Look out!

1100
01:05:22,686 --> 01:05:25,654
No... no...
Come on!
Take down the Alpha!

1101
01:05:44,206 --> 01:05:45,974
Thank you.

1102
01:05:45,976 --> 01:05:47,676
For you, my dear...

1103
01:05:47,678 --> 01:05:49,644
Anything.

1104
01:05:57,053 --> 01:05:59,187
Val, do you think
you can stop them?

1105
01:05:59,189 --> 01:06:01,623
I'll do my best.
Come on, cloudjumper!

1106
01:06:01,625 --> 01:06:03,625
You!

1107
01:06:03,627 --> 01:06:05,994
I watched you burn!

1108
01:06:05,996 --> 01:06:08,330
It takes more than
a little fire to kill me!

1109
01:06:31,087 --> 01:06:32,387
Stoick!

1110
01:06:52,775 --> 01:06:54,175
No!

1111
01:06:56,246 --> 01:06:58,079
No!

1112
01:07:19,068 --> 01:07:20,468
We've won.

1113
01:07:20,470 --> 01:07:21,803
Now...

1114
01:07:21,805 --> 01:07:23,538
Finish her!

1115
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:25,073
No!

1116
01:07:33,115 --> 01:07:34,282
Hold on!

1117
01:07:34,284 --> 01:07:35,583
Skullcrusher, go!

1118
01:07:35,585 --> 01:07:37,719
Come on, gobber!

1119
01:07:37,721 --> 01:07:40,155
Right behind you, stoick!

1120
01:07:59,208 --> 01:08:00,442
Stop!

1121
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:03,845
Stop!

1122
01:08:09,686 --> 01:08:13,721
This...
Is the great dragon master?

1123
01:08:13,723 --> 01:08:16,257
The son of stoick the vast?

1124
01:08:17,727 --> 01:08:21,563
What shame he must feel.

1125
01:08:21,565 --> 01:08:24,299
All of this loss...

1126
01:08:24,301 --> 01:08:25,834
And for what?

1127
01:08:25,836 --> 01:08:27,802
To become unstoppable?

1128
01:08:27,804 --> 01:08:30,238
To rule the world?

1129
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:33,608
Dragons, they-they are kind,
amazing creatures

1130
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:35,810
that can bring people together.

1131
01:08:37,747 --> 01:08:40,815
Or tear them apart.

1132
01:08:42,552 --> 01:08:45,253
You see, I know what it is

1133
01:08:45,255 --> 01:08:47,755
to live in fear,

1134
01:08:47,757 --> 01:08:50,592
to see my village burned,

1135
01:08:50,594 --> 01:08:53,628
my family taken.

1136
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:56,364
But even as a boy...

1137
01:08:56,366 --> 01:08:58,566
Left with nothing,

1138
01:08:58,568 --> 01:09:00,735
I vowed to rise above

1139
01:09:00,737 --> 01:09:03,371
the fear of dragons...

1140
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:08,143
...and liberate the
people of this world.

1141
01:09:08,145 --> 01:09:10,445
Then why a dragon army?

1142
01:09:10,447 --> 01:09:14,849
Well, you need dragons
to conquer other dragons.

1143
01:09:14,851 --> 01:09:18,253
Or maybe you need dragons
to conquer people...

1144
01:09:18,255 --> 01:09:21,156
To control those
who follow you...

1145
01:09:21,158 --> 01:09:23,625
And to get rid
of those who won't.

1146
01:09:26,229 --> 01:09:28,496
Clever boy.

1147
01:09:28,498 --> 01:09:30,932
The world wants peace,

1148
01:09:30,934 --> 01:09:34,269
and we have the answer
back on berk.

1149
01:09:34,271 --> 01:09:36,404
Just... let me show you...

1150
01:09:36,406 --> 01:09:38,473
no!

1151
01:09:38,475 --> 01:09:40,241
Let me...

1152
01:09:40,243 --> 01:09:42,277
Show you!

1153
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:50,920
What in...

1154
01:09:55,725 --> 01:09:57,892
Hiccup!

1155
01:09:57,894 --> 01:10:00,361
Come on, gobber!

1156
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:02,830
Okay, change of plan.

1157
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:08,636
No dragon can resist
the Alpha's command.

1158
01:10:08,638 --> 01:10:12,674
So he who controls the Alpha...

1159
01:10:12,676 --> 01:10:15,977
Controls them all.

1160
01:10:18,448 --> 01:10:20,815
Toothless?

1161
01:10:26,223 --> 01:10:28,590
T-toothless, you okay,
bud? What's going on?

1162
01:10:28,592 --> 01:10:30,458
Witness true strength.

1163
01:10:32,596 --> 01:10:35,663
The strength
of will over others.

1164
01:10:40,502 --> 01:10:42,237
In the face of it,

1165
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:45,607
you are nothing.

1166
01:10:49,712 --> 01:10:52,447
Uh... what did
he just tell you?

1167
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:57,752
Toothless, come on.

1168
01:10:57,754 --> 01:10:59,554
What's the matter with you?

1169
01:10:59,556 --> 01:11:01,356
No, no, no, no, come on,
what are you doing?

1170
01:11:01,358 --> 01:11:02,757
Knock it off.

1171
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:05,260
Stop! Snap out of it!

1172
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:13,534
Toothless, no!

1173
01:11:13,536 --> 01:11:15,503
Toothless!

1174
01:11:19,409 --> 01:11:20,875
Don't!
Hiccup!

1175
01:11:22,379 --> 01:11:24,512
Stop...!
Son!

1176
01:11:24,514 --> 01:11:25,514
Dad!

1177
01:11:25,515 --> 01:11:26,781
No!

1178
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:34,589
Hmm.

1179
01:11:45,769 --> 01:11:47,669
No...

1180
01:11:54,978 --> 01:11:56,644
Dad!

1181
01:11:56,646 --> 01:11:58,646
Stoick...

1182
01:12:01,817 --> 01:12:03,384
Dad?

1183
01:12:03,386 --> 01:12:05,620
No. You...

1184
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,467
No.

1185
01:12:28,711 --> 01:12:30,511
No, no, no. No.

1186
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:54,135
No! Get away from him!

1187
01:12:56,005 --> 01:12:57,638
Go on! Get out of here!

1188
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:00,475
Get away!

1189
01:13:00,477 --> 01:13:03,444
It's not his fault.

1190
01:13:03,446 --> 01:13:05,747
You know that.

1191
01:13:10,652 --> 01:13:12,720
<i>Good dragons</i>

1192
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:14,589
<i>under the control
of bad people...</i>

1193
01:13:14,591 --> 01:13:18,025
No, wait. Don't go.
<i>...Do bad things.</i>

1194
01:13:37,913 --> 01:13:40,581
Come on!

1195
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:42,917
Gather the men
and meet me at berk!

1196
01:13:42,919 --> 01:13:46,487
Toothless!
No, don't.

1197
01:14:11,814 --> 01:14:14,549
May the valkyries welcome you

1198
01:14:14,551 --> 01:14:17,585
and lead you through
odin's great battlefield.

1199
01:14:17,587 --> 01:14:20,855
May they sing your name
with love and fury,

1200
01:14:20,857 --> 01:14:24,826
so that we might hear it rise
from the depths of Valhalla,

1201
01:14:24,828 --> 01:14:27,695
and know that you've taken
your rightful place

1202
01:14:27,697 --> 01:14:31,599
at the table of kings.

1203
01:14:31,601 --> 01:14:33,868
For a great man has fallen.

1204
01:14:33,870 --> 01:14:35,503
A warrior.

1205
01:14:36,605 --> 01:14:38,606
A chieftain.

1206
01:14:38,608 --> 01:14:40,541
A father.

1207
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:43,845
A friend.

1208
01:15:17,246 --> 01:15:20,748
I'm sorry, dad.

1209
01:15:31,793 --> 01:15:34,061
I'm not the chief that...

1210
01:15:34,063 --> 01:15:36,230
You wanted me to be.

1211
01:15:36,232 --> 01:15:39,800
And I'm not the peacekeeper
I thought I was.

1212
01:15:41,904 --> 01:15:45,039
I... don't know...

1213
01:15:57,185 --> 01:16:00,187
You came early into this world.

1214
01:16:00,189 --> 01:16:02,823
You were such a wee thing.

1215
01:16:02,825 --> 01:16:06,327
Oh, so frail, so fragile.

1216
01:16:06,329 --> 01:16:08,896
I feared you wouldn't make it.

1217
01:16:10,699 --> 01:16:13,267
But your father...

1218
01:16:13,269 --> 01:16:16,070
He never doubted.

1219
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:20,341
He always said you'd become
the strongest of them all.

1220
01:16:20,343 --> 01:16:22,643
And he was right.

1221
01:16:23,879 --> 01:16:26,814
You have the heart of a chief,

1222
01:16:26,816 --> 01:16:29,250
and the soul of a dragon.

1223
01:16:29,252 --> 01:16:33,988
Only you can bring
our worlds together.

1224
01:16:33,990 --> 01:16:38,059
That... is who
you are, son.

1225
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:53,975
I, uh...

1226
01:16:53,977 --> 01:16:57,111
I was so afraid
of becoming my dad.

1227
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:02,049
Mostly because
I thought I never could.

1228
01:17:02,051 --> 01:17:05,119
How-how do you become someone...

1229
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:07,722
That great, that... brave,

1230
01:17:07,724 --> 01:17:10,224
that... selfless?

1231
01:17:13,328 --> 01:17:16,297
I guess you can only try.

1232
01:17:23,705 --> 01:17:26,807
A chief protects his own.

1233
01:17:29,678 --> 01:17:31,345
We're going back.

1234
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:36,984
Uh... with what?
Uh, he took
all the dragons.

1235
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:39,353
Not all of them.

1236
01:17:43,092 --> 01:17:44,425
Whoa!

1237
01:17:44,427 --> 01:17:47,762
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1238
01:17:50,099 --> 01:17:51,399
I don't want to die!

1239
01:17:51,401 --> 01:17:53,668
We can't fly things!

1240
01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:54,835
Yeah, no kidding!

1241
01:17:54,837 --> 01:17:56,837
Whoa...!

1242
01:17:58,307 --> 01:18:00,041
But won't that bewilderbeast

1243
01:18:00,043 --> 01:18:02,810
just take control
of these guys, too?

1244
01:18:02,812 --> 01:18:05,713
They're babies!
They don't listen to anyone.

1245
01:18:05,715 --> 01:18:07,848
Yeah. Just like us.

1246
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:10,418
This is... whoa!...
Very dangerous!

1247
01:18:14,057 --> 01:18:16,424
Some might suggest

1248
01:18:16,426 --> 01:18:19,026
this is poorly conceived!

1249
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:21,062
Well, it's a good thing
that I never listen.

1250
01:18:21,064 --> 01:18:22,463
Whoa!

1251
01:18:22,465 --> 01:18:23,898
So...

1252
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:24,900
What is your...

1253
01:18:24,901 --> 01:18:26,267
Plan?

1254
01:18:26,269 --> 01:18:29,236
Get toothless back
and kick drago's...

1255
01:18:29,238 --> 01:18:31,072
Heads up!

1256
01:18:31,074 --> 01:18:32,940
And that thing.

1257
01:18:32,942 --> 01:18:34,909
Whoa... ow!

1258
01:18:54,963 --> 01:18:56,430
Oh! Oh...

1259
01:18:56,432 --> 01:18:58,432
Ah, that's a good boy.

1260
01:19:02,872 --> 01:19:04,171
Uh...

1261
01:19:04,173 --> 01:19:06,107
W-w-watch the
furniture!

1262
01:19:06,109 --> 01:19:08,242
Where are you going?

1263
01:19:25,795 --> 01:19:28,829
Your chief... is dead!

1264
01:19:28,831 --> 01:19:31,198
Stoick?
No!
Not possible!

1265
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,801
No one can protect you now!

1266
01:19:48,084 --> 01:19:50,484
No.

1267
01:19:50,486 --> 01:19:54,288
He took all the dragons.

1268
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:55,923
Distract the Alpha.

1269
01:19:55,925 --> 01:19:58,392
Try to keep his focus
off of toothless.

1270
01:19:58,394 --> 01:19:59,894
Uh, how?

1271
01:19:59,896 --> 01:20:02,062
Have you forgotten
who you're riding with?

1272
01:20:02,064 --> 01:20:05,499
There isn't a dragon alive
that I can't wrangle! Aah!

1273
01:20:05,501 --> 01:20:08,569
- Except for this one...!
- Amateur.

1274
01:20:08,571 --> 01:20:11,038
Hey, look! It's hiccup!

1275
01:20:16,579 --> 01:20:19,513
What?

1276
01:20:32,962 --> 01:20:34,595
Keep 'em coming!

1277
01:20:34,597 --> 01:20:36,297
Black sheep, baby!

1278
01:20:46,609 --> 01:20:48,475
Ten points!

1279
01:20:50,246 --> 01:20:52,012
Uh-oh.

1280
01:21:02,625 --> 01:21:04,592
I'm okay!

1281
01:21:12,101 --> 01:21:15,502
You certainly are hard
to get rid of, I'll say that.

1282
01:21:15,504 --> 01:21:17,504
Toothless...

1283
01:21:17,506 --> 01:21:19,506
Hey.

1284
01:21:19,508 --> 01:21:21,609
It's me, bud.

1285
01:21:21,611 --> 01:21:23,110
It's me.

1286
01:21:23,112 --> 01:21:25,179
It's me.
I'm right here, bud.

1287
01:21:25,181 --> 01:21:27,081
Come back to me.

1288
01:21:29,018 --> 01:21:31,652
He's not yours anymore.

1289
01:21:31,654 --> 01:21:34,054
He belongs to the Alpha.

1290
01:21:34,056 --> 01:21:37,524
But, please,
o great dragon master,

1291
01:21:37,526 --> 01:21:40,160
try... to take him.

1292
01:21:40,162 --> 01:21:43,597
He will not miss a second time.

1293
01:21:43,599 --> 01:21:45,933
It wasn't your fault, bud.

1294
01:21:47,303 --> 01:21:49,670
They... made you do it.

1295
01:21:59,181 --> 01:22:01,515
You'd never hurt him.

1296
01:22:05,254 --> 01:22:08,489
You'd never hurt me.

1297
01:22:11,694 --> 01:22:13,661
How are you doing that?

1298
01:22:13,663 --> 01:22:17,164
Please.
You are my best friend, bud.

1299
01:22:21,303 --> 01:22:23,203
My best friend.

1300
01:22:28,043 --> 01:22:30,444
Attaboy! That's it!

1301
01:22:30,446 --> 01:22:31,478
I'm here.

1302
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:33,180
Enough!

1303
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:39,019
Yeah!

1304
01:22:39,021 --> 01:22:41,121
Hang on!

1305
01:22:45,594 --> 01:22:47,428
Almost there, buddy,
almost there.

1306
01:22:56,571 --> 01:22:59,073
Do something!

1307
01:22:59,075 --> 01:23:01,041
We need to get those two apart.

1308
01:23:11,287 --> 01:23:13,754
We gotta block him out,
toothless.

1309
01:23:13,756 --> 01:23:15,589
Do you trust me, bud?

1310
01:23:17,693 --> 01:23:19,493
We can do this.

1311
01:23:19,495 --> 01:23:22,262
You... and me...

1312
01:23:22,264 --> 01:23:23,998
As one.

1313
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:27,768
That's it.

1314
01:23:27,770 --> 01:23:31,105
Now let's try this
one more time!

1315
01:23:31,107 --> 01:23:34,208
Take him down, babe!

1316
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:38,746
Go get him.

1317
01:23:41,216 --> 01:23:42,583
Take control of it!

1318
01:23:45,253 --> 01:23:46,520
Shut it out, toothless.

1319
01:23:46,522 --> 01:23:48,155
Stop them!
Now!

1320
01:23:52,795 --> 01:23:54,628
Huh...?

1321
01:24:11,479 --> 01:24:12,513
Not again.

1322
01:24:14,682 --> 01:24:17,751
Toothless, it's now or never!

1323
01:24:19,687 --> 01:24:21,155
Come on, bud!

1324
01:24:23,359 --> 01:24:24,391
Hold on!

1325
01:24:27,562 --> 01:24:29,830
Ya-ha! We did it!

1326
01:24:38,107 --> 01:24:40,641
Hold him there, toothless.

1327
01:24:40,643 --> 01:24:42,776
It's all over now.

1328
01:24:44,447 --> 01:24:46,080
Or is it?

1329
01:24:46,848 --> 01:24:48,715
Uh...

1330
01:24:48,717 --> 01:24:50,150
Oh, no!

1331
01:24:58,861 --> 01:25:00,594
No!

1332
01:25:00,596 --> 01:25:03,564
No!

1333
01:25:11,406 --> 01:25:12,539
Hiccup...

1334
01:25:43,672 --> 01:25:45,239
He's challenging the Alpha!

1335
01:25:45,241 --> 01:25:46,773
To protect you!

1336
01:26:12,568 --> 01:26:15,669
No, no, no, no, no! No!

1337
01:26:15,671 --> 01:26:17,671
Fight back! Fight!

1338
01:26:17,673 --> 01:26:18,872
Fight!

1339
01:26:21,442 --> 01:26:23,777
What's the matter with you!

1340
01:26:26,948 --> 01:26:30,784
Hold your ground!
Hold the line now!

1341
01:26:33,221 --> 01:26:35,289
Now do you get it?

1342
01:26:35,291 --> 01:26:38,825
This is what it is
to earn a dragon's loyalty.

1343
01:26:40,796 --> 01:26:42,629
Let this end now.

1344
01:26:42,631 --> 01:26:43,864
Never!

1345
01:26:43,866 --> 01:26:45,232
Come on!

1346
01:26:53,241 --> 01:26:54,775
Huh?

1347
01:27:08,324 --> 01:27:09,756
Fight!

1348
01:27:43,359 --> 01:27:45,826
The Alpha... protects them all.

1349
01:28:45,354 --> 01:28:48,488
You never cease
to amaze me, bud.

1350
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:51,658
Thank you.

1351
01:28:53,329 --> 01:28:56,363
Toothless, you know
that doesn't wash out!

1352
01:28:57,865 --> 01:29:00,701
I knew you'd come back!
You're back, my beauty!

1353
01:29:00,703 --> 01:29:02,035
Oh! Oh!

1354
01:29:02,037 --> 01:29:04,471
Stormfly!

1355
01:29:07,509 --> 01:29:10,043
Oh, give me a cuddle, grumpy!

1356
01:29:10,045 --> 01:29:11,678
Oh!

1357
01:29:13,615 --> 01:29:15,115
Who's my little princess!

1358
01:29:15,117 --> 01:29:16,817
Don't you ever leave
again, hookfang.

1359
01:29:16,819 --> 01:29:19,753
Oh, you are. Yes, you are.
I missed you...

1360
01:29:19,755 --> 01:29:20,987
Oh, barf...

1361
01:29:20,989 --> 01:29:22,789
Not you!

1362
01:29:24,425 --> 01:29:26,526
That was some

1363
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:28,662
pretty fine dragon-
wrangling back there.

1364
01:29:28,664 --> 01:29:30,397
You'd make a good trapper.

1365
01:29:30,399 --> 01:29:31,865
Whoa.

1366
01:29:31,867 --> 01:29:34,501
You know... skullcrusher
is gonna need somebody

1367
01:29:34,503 --> 01:29:36,370
to look after him now.

1368
01:29:36,372 --> 01:29:37,904
Me?

1369
01:29:41,509 --> 01:29:43,477
I'd be honored.

1370
01:29:44,512 --> 01:29:46,613
Oh, your father,

1371
01:29:46,615 --> 01:29:48,982
he'd be every bit
as proud as I am.

1372
01:29:48,984 --> 01:29:50,851
Thank you.

1373
01:29:50,853 --> 01:29:52,953
I'm really glad
you're here, mom.

1374
01:29:52,955 --> 01:29:55,021
And here I'll stay.

1375
01:29:56,557 --> 01:29:58,558
See?

1376
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,026
I told you it was in here.

1377
01:30:00,028 --> 01:30:02,028
Ah, ha, ha.

1378
01:30:02,030 --> 01:30:03,764
You're still doing that one.

1379
01:30:03,766 --> 01:30:05,532
That's hilarious.

1380
01:30:05,534 --> 01:30:08,034
Come here, you.
Mm!

1381
01:30:08,036 --> 01:30:10,137
Ooh!

1382
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:41,835
The chief has come home!

1383
01:30:45,606 --> 01:30:46,940
Yeah!

1384
01:30:48,543 --> 01:30:50,710
Long live the chief!

1385
01:30:50,712 --> 01:30:54,981
Long live the chief!
Long live the chief!

1386
01:30:54,983 --> 01:30:57,150
Long live the chief!

1387
01:31:07,763 --> 01:31:09,529
Yeah! Ha-ha!

1388
01:31:11,166 --> 01:31:12,666
Ah...

1389
01:31:12,668 --> 01:31:15,936
Yah-ha-ha-ha!

1390
01:31:19,842 --> 01:31:21,975
<i>This... is berk.</i>

1391
01:31:21,977 --> 01:31:24,578
<i>A bit trampled and busted</i>

1392
01:31:24,580 --> 01:31:27,113
<i>and covered in ice,
but it's home.</i>

1393
01:31:27,115 --> 01:31:29,516
<i>It's our home.</i>

1394
01:31:31,953 --> 01:31:33,720
<i>Those who attacked us</i>

1395
01:31:33,722 --> 01:31:35,822
<i>are relentless and crazy.</i>

1396
01:31:35,824 --> 01:31:38,692
<i>But those who stopped them?</i>

1397
01:31:38,694 --> 01:31:41,261
<i>Oh... even more so!</i>

1398
01:31:43,632 --> 01:31:47,133
<i>We may be small in numbers,
but we stand for something</i>

1399
01:31:47,135 --> 01:31:51,538
<i>bigger than anything
the world can pit against us.</i>

1400
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:53,974
<i>We are the voice of peace.</i>

1401
01:31:53,976 --> 01:31:58,044
<i>And bit by bit,
we will change this world.</i>

1402
01:32:02,284 --> 01:32:03,583
Wow!

1403
01:32:05,553 --> 01:32:08,822
<i>You see,
we have something they don't.</i>

1404
01:32:08,824 --> 01:32:10,290
<i>Oh, sure, they have armies,</i>

1405
01:32:10,292 --> 01:32:13,994
<i>and they have armadas, but we...</i>

1406
01:32:13,996 --> 01:32:16,997
<i>We have...</i>

1407
01:32:16,999 --> 01:32:18,999
<i>Our dragons!</i>

1408
01:32:19,305 --> 01:33:19,875
