1
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:24,510
ZOROARK
MASTER OF ILLUSIONS

2
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,120
As Ash's quest to become
a Pokemon Master continues,

3
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,400
our heroes have decided
to take a shortcut

4
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:44,040
to the Pokemon Backer
Championship in Crown City.

5
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,470
However, ...

6
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,560
Hey Brock...
You sure this is the right way?

7
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,550
Of course I am, Ash.
-And that means we're lost, right?

8
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,300
Not to worry, Dawn.

9
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,360
Check out the Beautifly!

10
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,140
There gorgeous.

11
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,540
You know what,
if we haven't gotten lost,

12
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,660
we would never seen them.
-Yeah!

13
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,260
So that means, we are
lost, after all, right?

14
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,520
You shouldn't tell a lie.

15
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,540
Point taken.

16
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,950
The twerps are more lost,
then they normally are.

17
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:39,910
The result of which is, that
we'll get to Crown City before they do.

18
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,080
Three legendary Pokemon
caught, before they say "boo"!

19
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,390
It's a Skiploom.

20
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,130
Something funny?

21
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,370
Pikachu, what's up?

22
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,860
Look at that.

23
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,090
Hey, knock it off!

24
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,090
Yeah, you!
There's nothing brave

25
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,730
about ganging up
like that!

26
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,660
Infernape,
I choose you!

27
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,390
Mamoswine,
help out!

28
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,600
Bullying is wrong!

29
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,580
Infernape, return!

30
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,190
Thanks, Mamoswine.

31
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,620
I'm glad we avoided a fight.
-Yeah.

32
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,080
I wouldn't have
needed your help, anyway.

33
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,630
Excuse me, but you
were just about to get pushed

34
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:10,830
off of a cliff, right there.
-His right. -That's one tough Pokemon.

35
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,260
You talked!?

36
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,470
Yeah.
So, I did.

37
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,930
That's telepathy.
-Mima told me, I should never

38
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,260
talk to strangers.
Too late.

39
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,570
I've never seen
this kinda Pokemon.

40
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,210
Have you Brock?
-No, never.

41
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,160
I'm going to that city,
down there.

42
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,630
Hey, that's Crown City!

43
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,760
So, that's it.

44
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,370
I'm going to save Mima.

45
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,650
But who's Mima?
-Mima's Mima.

46
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,240
So, this Mima, you're
trying to save, is in Crown City?

47
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,700
Mima was trying to protect me
and wound up getting caught.

48
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:05,470
Some really bad people
brought us here from across the sea.

49
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,230
You mean, they did it
against your will?

50
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,850
Then what?
-The put us on a flying boat.

51
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:15,510
You mean an airplane?
-Then, I fell of the boat.

52
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,550
So you escaped.

53
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,310
Yeah, let's do this!
-Yeah!

54
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:35,880
All right, so I'll help you out.
-Me too. -Count me in.

55
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:41,250
Ok, I guess,
I can let you be my friends.

56
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,060
No way!

57
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,540
Well, obviously,
it can change it's appearance.

58
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,950
Come on.

59
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,330
Look, a tail.

60
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,270
I like this better.

61
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:48,150
Zoroark,
your mission begins.

62
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,790
Go and show your illusions
to the people of the city.

63
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,170
Mr. Kodai.
Dispatching remote cameras.

64
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,140
Good.
Now, it's show time.

65
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,230
See, mommy, you see?
-Tammy, morning!

66
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,140
Oh, morning.
-So, the Coronet Fighters

67
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,740
are gonna win, for sure!

68
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,660
Watch this.

69
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:56,540
Coronet Fighters rock, roll,
because they've got the winning heart and soul!

70
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:00,040
Coronet Fighters in control!
-Oh, my, she's perky.

71
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:21,130
Good morning, Tammy.
You know, tomorrow is...

72
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,360
There's no time for that now!

73
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,330
What's wrong?

74
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,840
Wrong? Celebi has finally
come back to the city!

75
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,070
It that true?

76
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,230
Really.

77
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,230
It's been years, since
all the all the cities trees and flowers

78
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,620
were layed to waste.

79
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,610
Yes, more then 20 years.

80
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,900
Thau should be
illegal before noon.

81
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:09,880
Some short night.
-I vote to in pitch the sun.

82
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,410
Who's that Pokemon?
-I'm clueless.

83
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:35,200
Take the form of
Entei, Raikou and Suicune!

84
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,470
Strike fear into
the hearts of the citizens!

85
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,350
Check that out!

86
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:55,420
We've cited a Suicune.
-It practically landed in my lap.

87
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:56,950
My kinda sap.

88
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,950
Suicune?

89
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:18,330
Help!
What's going on here?!

90
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,290
Camera 1,
zoom in on Suicune.

91
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:26,540
Yes, sir.

92
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,680
And camera 2
on the fleeing people.

93
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,200
Understood.

94
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:34,100
Now, give me
a composite shot.

95
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,330
I'm sure, you don't
want me to hurt Zoroark.

96
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:00,730
Suicune, don't
fly the coop like that.

97
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,150
Entei!

98
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,120
All right,
time for my apology.

99
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,630
Everyone,
inside!

100
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,180
Attention,
all Crown City citizens!

101
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,400
The following is an
urgent communication

102
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,060
from the
Kodai Network Group.

103
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,540
And now,
her's president Grings Kodai.

104
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:12,740
I'd like to take this opportunity,
to sincerely apologize to you all.

105
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,200
The three legendary Pokemon,
I've brought here for you,

106
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:21,150
Entei, Raikou and Suicune,
are now controlled by the evil Pokemon

107
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,560
Zoroark.
The legendary Pokemon

108
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,290
are terrorizing your city!

109
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,590
Your citizens are now
in extreme danger!

110
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,510
Again, my most
sincere apologize.

111
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,380
We will recapture them!
That you can be sure of.

112
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:00,510
But for now, I order
all to leave the city.

113
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,790
All right,
move along, please.

114
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,830
This announcement is
for all people on route

115
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,670
to the Pokemon Baker Match!

116
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:12,270
The old town in Crown City
is officially of limits

117
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,830
and access will
not be permitted!

118
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,180
Officer Jenny.

119
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:25,160
You can't deny my
access to you heart!

120
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,230
Officer,
what's happened?

121
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:30,060
It's Zoroark.
A bad Pokemon,

122
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,480
controlling
Entei, Raikou and Suicune

123
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,200
as they wreak havoc
in the city.

124
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,940
Legendary Pokemon
are doing that?

125
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:39,580
It's true, I saw
it with my own eyes!

126
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,940
It's just horrible!
-But what's gonna happen

127
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,840
with the Pokemon
Baker Match?

128
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:47,410
It won't be canceled will it?
-We're working hard to solve th problem,

129
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:50,760
so, please, don't worry.
-Thank goodness for that!

130
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,380
Zoroark is a Pokemon,
raging with evil.

131
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:56,730
We're in great danger here.
Because of this,

132
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,830
no one will be
allowed to enter the city,

133
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,860
until recapture is complete.

134
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,060
Zoroark.

135
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,800
Mima!
That's my Mima!

136
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,170
Hold on!
Your Mima's the Pokemon,

137
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,150
Zoroark, who's
terrorizing the city?

138
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,880
Mima escaped from the bad people
and is looking for me!

139
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,220
I'm sure of it!
-Hey! Hang on!

140
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,720
Look, Kodai's the bad guy!
-So, the bad person,

141
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,020
you've been talking about,
is the Kodai?

142
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:45,690
That's him!
-Hey, keep it down.

143
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,100
I wanna hear about it.

144
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,240
All of it.

145
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:53,530
I really love my twin brother,
but sometimes he'll just come out

146
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:56,630
and say the craziest things.
-Twin brother, huh?

147
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,860
And one with the tail,
no less.

148
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,670
A Zorua!
-Zorua?

149
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,400
An able to talk.

150
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:09,670
What a surprise.
-You've seen a Zorua before?

151
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,170
Zorua is the pre-evolved
form of Zoroark.

152
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,040
Celebi presence
confirmed.

153
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,030
It's just as
I saw in my vision.

154
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,990
The Time Ripple
must be in Crown City.

155
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,310
Mr. Kodai!

156
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,810
The Time Ripple!

157
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:05,820
And the countdown clock!

158
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:09,440
My vision...
My vision has become clouded!

159
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,050
I must be reaching
my limit!

160
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,180
Who are these people?

161
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,670
What?
That's...

162
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,880
I knew it!
The Time Ripple will be mine!

163
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,990
It's a vision
of the future?

164
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,910
That's right, Rowena.
-What are you seeing?

165
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:39,410
Faces of people,
trying to...

166
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,570
...stop me.

167
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:47,820
So, Kodai was involved
in the whole thing.

168
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,620
Only thing we wanna do,
is bring Zorua back to Zoroark and fast.

169
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,660
I'm gonna go
find my Mima.

170
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:59,210
Right, I'll help anyway I can.
-Awesome, thanks!

171
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,850
Hey, I'm Ash
and this is my partner, Pikachu.

172
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,650
My name is Dawn
and this is Piplop.

173
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:08,450
I'm Brock.

174
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:11,640
The name's Karl.
I'm a journalist.

175
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,910
I had a hunch, Kodai has been
keeping some kinda secret

176
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,690
and I've been
investigating it.

177
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,600
What's that? -It connects
to the old part of the city.

178
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,820
The truth is,
Crown City is my home town.

179
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,630
Bronzor,
use Flash!

180
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:54,960
Grings Kodai has been called
"The man who can see into the future".

181
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,230
Future?

182
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,030
And it sure seems that way.
Kodai has had an incredible

183
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:04,870
series of business successes.
Like he knows what's going to happen.

184
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,970
He now has control
over the main stream media.

185
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:17,230
The word on the street is,
in order to get, what he wants,

186
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,530
there's absolutely nothing
he won't do.

187
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,680
But, what's Kodai
doing this time?

188
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,330
By controlling Zoroark?

189
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:28,740
Beats me.
-But he's a bad man!

190
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,750
Let's hurry!

191
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,800
Hey, don't you dare
change into me!

192
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,880
Good.

193
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,740
It appears, that the old town
is completely deserted.

194
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,010
Good,
I'm heading there now.

195
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,170
Sir!

196
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,940
Zoroark's mission is complete.
Recapture it.

197
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,160
Understood.

198
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,670
Zoroak's recapture,
complete.

199
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:55,310
Now, transferring
to air ship.

200
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:19,240
No fair,
getting Zoroark was our game!

201
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,330
Who were,
those greedy rascals?

202
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:24,240
Strange ones.
-But the legendary Pokemon

203
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,940
trio's still prime
for pluckin'.

204
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:29,810
That's three for me,
so shall we make history?

205
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,380
Rowena, continue
transferring the footage.

206
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:41,630
As you wish.

207
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:59,000
I was afraid he'd
never leave.

208
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:02,820
Ok, maybe now, I can
get some real work done.

209
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,320
Yes, it won't be long now.

210
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,810
Thank you, Bronzor.

211
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,640
Wow, what a pretty place.
-Sure is.

212
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,860
Hey, Karl,
isn't that Celebi?

213
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:38,810
Right.

214
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,070
They say, that Celebi sometimes
comes here to visit.

215
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,840
Take a look.
It's like the city in forest

216
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,700
coexist in perfect harmony.

217
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,260
Yeah, but it wasn't
always this way.

218
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:54,950
Twenty years ago, almost all of
the trees and flower here

219
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:56,920
died off.
-How did that happen?

220
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,500
No, one knows.
Anyway...

221
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:01,610
It was a terrible time.

222
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:18,060
But working together,
people and Pokemon,

223
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:21,450
finally brought Crown City
back to it's beautiful life.

224
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:29,300
You could never tell,
that things were once so bad.

225
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,820
I can smell Mima.
-Really?

226
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,440
Are you sure?

227
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,490
Mima was here,
for sure.

228
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:49,650
I told you before,
not me!

229
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,300
Thank you.

230
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:58,430
Mima!
I'm over here!

231
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:00,480
Mima!

232
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:08,210
Hey, don't worry.
Mima's looking for you too,

233
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:11,390
I'm sure. It's not gonna
be very much longer.

234
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,900
Right.
Yeah, I can feel it.

235
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,340
That's weird.

236
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,130
It's not destroyed.

237
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:36,460
You're right.
But, I saw Entei on the news.

238
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,040
What does it mean?

239
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:41,700
Kodai did this.

240
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:44,560
He manipulated
the TV news images.

241
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,130
Fake video?

242
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,890
Zoroark has the power
to take the shape of the

243
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:51,210
legendary Pokemon.
-So, you mean,

244
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,390
legendary Pokemon
aren't really here?

245
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:55,380
Then Kodai
tricked us.

246
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,930
Mima's scent is this way.

247
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:00,640
Ok, let's go!

248
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:08,450
Zoroark is an evil Pokemon.
Until it is captured,

249
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:11,210
no one will be allowed
to enter the city.

250
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,580
Thanks you
for your cooperation.

251
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,000
My vision of the future
has been proven correct.

252
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,310
This is Rowena, sir.
Beginning today,

253
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,050
she'll be your
executive secretary.

254
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,510
It's an honor, sir.

255
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,620
Very good!

256
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,330
Mr. Kodai!

257
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,900
Don't worry.

258
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:48,940
What is this?
I need more clarity.

259
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,250
The Time Ripple!

260
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:11,990
No, don't stop!

261
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,100
I still can't see the precise
location of the Time Ripple!

262
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:27,840
It's been quite a long time,
since Kodai last had a future vision.

263
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:30,260
A future vision?

264
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,490
I'm losing my power!

265
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,900
The Time Ripple appears.

266
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:45,200
It's the day before the
Pokemon Baker Championship begins.

267
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:49,450
Zoroark and the legendary
Pokemon are running wild.

268
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,510
And I'm there too.

269
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,590
I must find it.

270
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,350
Before the
Time Ripple disappears.

271
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:09,890
The countdown clocks.
There all around the city.

272
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,990
And the Time Ripple
must be near one of them.

273
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,910
Shuppet,
use Foresight!

274
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,260
Not here.

275
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:57,540
Twenty more spots.

276
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,220
So they showed up after all!

277
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,620
Goone, do you copy?

278
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,290
Sir!

279
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,210
There's a little problem,
I want you to take care of.

280
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:21,490
Sir!

281
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,550
Mima's scent is here too.

282
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:30,100
Hey, Karl,
what's that a statue of?

283
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,130
The city's guardian
protectors.

284
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:33,830
Guardian protectors?

285
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,890
When Crown City
was in danger in ancient times,

286
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:39,940
it is said, that
Entei, Raikou and Suicune,

287
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:42,200
came here to rescue it
and its people.

288
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,100
There statues
are all over the city.

289
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:46,860
And to think
Celebi comes here, as well.

290
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,680
Sad to know, it's being hurt.

291
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,230
That's still
in one piece too.

292
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:01,980
Mima's this way!

293
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,810
Zorua!

294
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,130
...controlled by the
dark Pokemon, Zoroark,

295
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,940
and are now running amok.

296
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,100
It's all lies!

297
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:44,970
No one will be allowed
to enter the city,

298
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:47,080
until we capture it...

299
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,880
Who do you think you are?
I'm strong, you know?

300
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,670
I'm... strong...
stay...

301
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:22,500
You ok?

302
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,510
Come on!
Cut it out!

303
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:27,340
Yeah, all right!

304
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,140
Been a long time,
Mightyena.

305
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,840
Ok, ok...
-Oh, my, Karl!

306
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,330
It really is you.

307
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:37,320
Hey there, grandpa.
Great to see you.

308
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:42,820
My dear Karl,
such a long time.

309
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:43,910
Tammy!

310
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:51,090
Zorua!
-This little one is your friend?

311
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,500
Tangrowth's sleep powder
worked a little to well.

312
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,320
I'm sorry.

313
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,710
Got to find Mima.

314
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,550
Entei, Raikou and Suicune
are now controlled

315
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:09,070
by the evil Pokemon Zoroark.
Those three are terrorizing your city.

316
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,740
Citiz...

317
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,490
Zoroark must have changed
into the shape of those

318
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:16,530
legendary Pokemon.
The city hasn't been destroyed.

319
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,980
So, this whole event
was nothing but a trick?

320
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:23,690
I knew all along, that our guardian
protectors wouldn't do any of this.

321
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:27,170
Yeah, Kodai's the only bad guy.
-And of course, that means,

322
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:30,420
Zoroark is innocent too.
-You're right.

323
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,860
But, why didn't the two
of you evacuate?

324
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,700
The truth is, neither one of us,
could bear the thought of leaving

325
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,580
our beautiful home.
-And after all,

326
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:42,250
Celebi finally just returned,
after so long.

327
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,420
Celebi's here?
-Are you sure?

328
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,030
Tangrowth and I, both saw
it with our very own eyes.

329
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,150
Right, see it's been twenty
long years, since the day,

330
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:57,310
when all our lush greenery died
and that's when Celebi stopped

331
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,930
coming back to visit.

332
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:04,730
Mima.

333
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:32,790
Mima!
Mima's calling me!

334
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:33,820
Zorua.

335
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:37,760
Zorua, calm down!

336
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:41,570
Mima!
Where's my Mima?

337
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:54,980
Pikachu!
-Piplop!

338
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,270
Follow me!

339
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,380
What do you want?

340
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,900
I've got no
reason to fight you.

341
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:07,610
Out of my way!
I'm gonna go find my Mima!

342
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,790
Look at that!
-The berries.

343
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:17,500
That's for me?

344
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,390
I surprised you.

345
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,120
No, I can't fly.

346
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:39,840
I think, I'll let you
be my friend too.

347
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:44,880
Come on, you can
help me look for Mima.

348
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:47,190
Let's go!

349
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,640
You see that?
That Pokemon with Zorua?

350
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,000
It looked like Celebi.

351
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:08,610
Of course! So, Celebi
made the berries grow.

352
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,540
What do you think...

353
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,750
Ash, no.
-Are you ok?

354
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:28,320
Not one of you,
has the power to resist me.

355
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,870
It's you.
-Kodai.

356
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,760
So, why did you
lock us up?

357
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,640
I don't know, who you are,
and I couldn't care less.

358
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,710
But, I'm certain, I won't allow you
to get in my way

359
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,240
and that you can depend on.
-What do you mean?

360
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,900
I have the power
to see the future.

361
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:45,170
Future?

362
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:49,720
And all obstacles in my path.
And so, I must remove all of them.

363
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,810
No use.
-But, Karl...

364
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:03,130
Check out the wide load.
-A legendary load, per chance.

365
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:06,060
I'll wager it's Entei,
Raikou or Suicune.

366
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:09,010
Well, this time we have
the element of surprise.

367
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:10,610
Words to the wise!

368
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:16,730
No!

369
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:51,620
Mima, where are you?

370
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:31,030
Mima.

371
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:48,770
Mima,
I miss you so much.

372
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,620
You're amazing.

373
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:14,260
It's kinda of like
being curled up in Mima's fur.

374
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:57,490
So, his most important files
are locked.

375
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:01,110
Now, what password,
would he come up with?

376
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,280
V-I-S-I-O-N.

377
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,860
On one try, that was
almost to easy.

378
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:17,680
Books of ancient prophecies.

379
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:23,350
So that's it.

380
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:25,270
That explains everything.

381
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,510
Rowena!

382
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:30,740
I'm heading back to Kodai's location,
I'll be a bit longer.

383
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:33,450
Stay put, until
our mission is complete.

384
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:35,130
Understood, sir.

385
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,770
My heart!
That scared me.

386
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:49,240
What's that?

387
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,540
Who are you?
-My name's Rowena.

388
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:03,990
Mr. Kodai's
executive secretary.

389
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:06,090
Right, and I'm his mom.

390
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:09,300
I'm actually a news
paper reporter, just like Karl.

391
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,380
I'm working undercover,
right now.

392
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:16,600
Investigating Kodai.

393
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,990
Your on our side!
-Excellent!

394
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:21,950
I had a feeling
you'd show up.

395
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:23,840
My investigation's complete.

396
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,830
It's all here.

397
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:39,350
So, this is it.
-You see, Kodai is trying

398
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:40,770
to locate the Time Ripple.

399
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:43,000
Time...
-...Ripple?

400
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:44,540
Grandpa told me about it.

401
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,460
It appears, when Celebi comes
to visit is, from the future.

402
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,090
Right.
The Time Ripple is a temporary

403
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,900
focal point that
actually collects time energy.

404
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:57,430
The Time Ripple last
for only about a day

405
00:43:57,630 --> 00:43:59,260
and in provides all the
necessary energy

406
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,250
for Celebi to
be able to time travel.

407
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:07,030
Kodai wants that energy
for himself, before it disappears.

408
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:10,240
Which he'll accomplish by
absorbing it into his body.

409
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,200
Why would he wanna do that?
-So, he'll have the power

410
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:15,970
to see into the future.
-The future?

411
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,170
Of course, remember,
he said, he could do that.

412
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:22,840
It was twenty years ago,
when Kodai gain the power

413
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:26,910
to see into the future.
By deciphering the ancient texts,

414
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:29,940
Kodai was able to unlock
the secrets of the prophets

415
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:32,370
and he learned, that the
Time Ripple actually

416
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:35,760
contains the power
to show people the future.

417
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:39,360
And so Kodai came here.
To the city, where Celebi

418
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,030
is known to appear.

419
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:49,310
Shuppet,
Foresight.

420
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,820
Finally, there it is!
The Time Ripple!

421
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:13,590
Don't let Celebi
touch the Time Ripple.

422
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:24,850
I've learned, the Time Ripple
disappears, when you touch it.

423
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:35,150
But, now it belongs to me.

424
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:15,620
I did it.
The future truly is all mine!

425
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:19,460
So, the flow of energy was reversed
and the trees and the flowers

426
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:23,490
in the city withered and died
and Kodai gained the power

427
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:25,500
to see into the future.

428
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:33,270
Since that time,
Kodai's plan has become reality.

429
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:35,930
So then, Kodai was the one
responsible for killing

430
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:37,340
all the cities greenery.

431
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,540
Not here!
-Is this the last

432
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:49,520
of the countdown clocks,
Mr. Kodai?

433
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:52,240
Yes.
We've checked all the others.

434
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:56,030
Where is it?
My visions never failed me before.

435
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:10,330
Mr. Kodai!

436
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:16,150
It's Celebi.

437
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,920
But now, Kodai's
power to see the future

438
00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:22,310
is fading.

439
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:25,630
And that's why,
he so desperate

440
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,050
to absorb the energy of
the Time Ripple again.

441
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,560
I get it now.
-Now, according to one

442
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,470
of Kodai's visions,
the Time Ripple is near

443
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:33,930
a countdown clock.

444
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,090
So, needless to say,
he's frantic to find it.

445
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:41,690
But, if Kodai finds
the Time Ripple again,...

446
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:44,990
Then the city will wither
and die, like before.

447
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:46,900
You've got it.

448
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,820
We won't let that happen!

449
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:55,840
Kodai's on the move again.

450
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:36,430
Zorua! So, this is where
you've been hiding.

451
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:39,110
Be careful.
He's a very bad man.

452
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:42,740
So, you can talk!
-Yeah.

453
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:45,000
But, I never wanted
to talk to you.

454
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:46,540
Then, stay out of the way.

455
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,130
My business is with Celebi.
-What do you want?

456
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,990
Now, Shuppet,
Psychic, let's go!

457
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,100
Celebi!

458
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:01,320
Stay out of this!

459
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,750
I won't let you
hurt Celebi!

460
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:11,440
Impudent app start.

461
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:22,680
Your powers of
deceptions have grown.

462
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:25,480
But, they have no
effect on me.

463
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,100
All right, Shuppet,
Shadow Ball!

464
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,270
Mima...

465
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:21,940
Was that...

466
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,730
All four on mess.
-Yeah.

467
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:17,620
Except, there not lookin'
quite the same as before.

468
00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:20,430
Stop living in the past.
We've got us a one stop swipe.

469
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:22,700
Isn't that neat?
-Sweet!

470
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:51,230
Perfect!
My vision's unfolding

471
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:52,620
just as I thought!

472
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:58,490
Yes, the Time Ripple.

473
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:04,350
More!
Show me more, now!

474
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:21,490
Celebi!

475
00:53:22,110 --> 00:53:23,370
Cut it out!

476
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:55,430
Suicune!
-Somethin' strange is up.

477
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:32,120
Those are the real
three legendary Pokemon.

478
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:34,560
Guardian protectors.
-That's right.

479
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:45,800
But, they must think,
that Zoroark is the enemy.

480
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:48,090
Right.
We're in danger!

481
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:04,220
Mr. Kodai.

482
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:11,910
I still want to see more.

483
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:17,510
Get them!

484
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:47,750
Rowena!

485
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:49,330
I knew it.

486
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:52,490
Sorry, I lied to you, Kodai.
The last paycheck...

487
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:53,910
Forget about it.

488
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:56,570
Pikachu!
-Piplop!

489
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:01,610
Celebi!

490
00:56:01,810 --> 00:56:03,290
Zorua!

491
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,370
Those punks.

492
00:56:24,810 --> 00:56:26,930
Mr. Kodai,
what do we do now?

493
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:29,350
I foresaw,
that Rowena would betray me.

494
00:56:30,070 --> 00:56:32,660
And I know, precisely,
what will happen.

495
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:40,950
What's this?
-It's grandpa's workshop.

496
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:44,520
Your back!

497
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:47,290
And you're all right.
-Hey, Joe.

498
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:48,480
Hi, Tammy.

499
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:51,270
Celebi!

500
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:58,730
So, Kodai was behind
Crown City's disaster

501
00:57:58,870 --> 00:58:00,650
from twenty years ago too.

502
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:05,770
You'll be just fine.

503
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,760
I couldn't protect Celebi.

504
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:13,540
Not long,
before you came back,

505
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:18,390
we actually got a glimpse
of the real Entei, Raikou and Suicune.

506
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:21,370
They must have sensed,
that the city is in grave danger.

507
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:25,040
Yes, but there all convinced,
that the enemy is Zoroark.

508
00:58:25,370 --> 00:58:28,720
So, how can we get them
to understand, that there wrong?

509
00:58:30,170 --> 00:58:31,750
Mima!

510
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:33,960
Celebi!

511
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,140
Take it easy, Celebi.

512
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,620
If we can somehow
reach the Time Ripple,

513
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:42,140
then Celebi
should be just fine.

514
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,160
Yeah, but where
is the Time Ripple?

515
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:47,780
Kodai was searching around
the vicinity of the countdown clocks.

516
00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:50,640
But he had already
checked them all.

517
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:54,110
So, you mean, Kodai's
already gotten his hands

518
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:55,530
on the Time Ripple?

519
00:58:55,730 --> 00:58:58,770
No, not yet.
The city's still lush and green.

520
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:02,730
The thing is,
there's one other countdown clock.

521
00:59:03,450 --> 00:59:04,170
Up there.

522
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:06,700
See, I'm the one,
who designed them all.

523
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:16,290
It's in the Stadium.

524
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:20,730
Located among the trees,
that were moved there from the city.

525
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:25,190
I placed the prototype there,
to commemorate the Stadiums completion.

526
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:27,020
So, the Time Ripple
must be there too.

527
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:29,320
And I'll be the one
to reach it first!

528
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:40,870
What's that?
-One of Kodai's robots.

529
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:43,800
But, what we just said...
-He heard all of it.

530
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:46,710
We've got to get
to the Time Ripple.

531
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:49,510
Or what happened twenty years ago,
will happen again.

532
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:51,890
It just can't!
-Tammy's right!

533
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:54,990
So, we've got to get Celebi
to the Time Ripple first.

534
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:59,950
Don't worry, Celebi.
I'll take you there myself.

535
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:02,050
I'm going.
-Me too.

536
01:00:04,910 --> 01:00:07,440
There's now way,
I'd ever give up.

537
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:09,650
So, you can count
me in too.

538
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:12,280
All right, let's go.

539
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:14,560
Wait a minute.

540
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:17,510
Kodai can see the future, right?

541
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:24,220
That's why, we'll work together
to change the future.

542
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:31,710
Taking this shortcut,
should take us all to the Stadium

543
01:00:31,870 --> 01:00:34,900
before Kodai!
-You sure, your right this time, Brock?

544
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:38,580
Trust me, no need to worry!
-I always trust you, Brock!

545
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:17,000
What's this?

546
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:25,260
There trapped
in Zoroark's illusion.

547
01:01:25,570 --> 01:01:30,230
Stop all this, at once, Zoroark!
-They made a mistake, that's all!

548
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:30,440
The Stadium!
-It's right over there.

549
01:02:37,470 --> 01:02:38,410
It's them!

550
01:02:38,590 --> 01:02:40,470
Ash and Pikachu,
go on ahead!

551
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:55,470
Good luck, you two!

552
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,760
You go and deal with them, now!

553
01:02:58,800 --> 01:02:59,850
Right.

554
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:38,890
Pikachu, use Thunderbolt!

555
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:42,120
Mismagius,
Psywave, quick!

556
01:03:45,850 --> 01:03:48,700
Celebi, hurry
and fly to the Time Ripple!

557
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:53,650
Stop Celebi!

558
01:03:58,330 --> 01:04:01,150
Don't let Celebi
touch the Time Ripple!

559
01:04:06,830 --> 01:04:09,150
Now, Piplop!
Whirlpool!

560
01:04:22,010 --> 01:04:24,590
Mamoswine!
-Hang tough, everyone!

561
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:27,120
It's about time
to finish you punks off!

562
01:04:32,470 --> 01:04:34,540
It's Zoroark!
But how?

563
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:48,160
Everyone, get back!

564
01:05:08,990 --> 01:05:10,770
Zorua, it's you!

565
01:05:22,050 --> 01:05:25,010
Use Psywave
and Shadow Ball!

566
01:05:30,830 --> 01:05:33,080
You are a bad man!

567
01:05:38,580 --> 01:05:40,090
That's enough!

568
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:56,650
Celebi.
Sorry, but Zorua

569
01:05:56,850 --> 01:05:58,570
managed to lead them away.

570
01:05:59,050 --> 01:06:02,120
Come on, just a little
further to the Time Ripple.

571
01:06:02,590 --> 01:06:04,400
Guess, you still can't fly.

572
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:31,990
That's it!

573
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:38,680
Mismagius, Psychic!

574
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:48,980
Of course.

575
01:06:49,510 --> 01:06:50,900
Celebi is hurt,

576
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:53,800
that's why it has revealed itself.

577
01:07:04,210 --> 01:07:06,330
Stop right there, Zoroark!

578
01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:08,770
Zorua!

579
01:07:09,690 --> 01:07:12,950
One step closer
and this little one is no more.

580
01:07:20,650 --> 01:07:23,710
I guess, there isn't
much time left for me.

581
01:07:25,590 --> 01:07:27,840
Shuppet, clean this up.

582
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:38,560
Zoroark!

583
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:42,990
I've thoroughly enjoyed
playing our little game of tag.

584
01:07:46,290 --> 01:07:49,840
However, I already knew
it would end this way!

585
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:03,460
Stop, Kodai!
All the trees and flowers will die!

586
01:08:04,170 --> 01:08:08,200
What do I care!
So long, as my visionary powers grow,

587
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:09,830
it's all worth it!

588
01:08:11,150 --> 01:08:13,910
So, you don't care
what happens to Crown City?

589
01:08:25,150 --> 01:08:29,100
It's true, that twenty years ago,
when I touched the Time Ripple,

590
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:31,390
Crown City withered.

591
01:08:31,590 --> 01:08:34,410
But, no one knows
a thing about that.

592
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:37,500
Just as no one will
know what I've done today.

593
01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:41,940
All anyone knows is, that I'm
doing my level best

594
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:44,500
to capture the evil
Pokemon, Zoroark.

595
01:08:55,170 --> 01:08:57,040
Victory is mine!

596
01:09:29,190 --> 01:09:33,340
This can't be an illusion?
But, my illusion canceler!

597
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:39,420
When it bite me!

598
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:46,520
Your finished, Kodai!
Give it up!

599
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:47,960
It's Karl!

600
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:49,500
Not you!

601
01:10:09,790 --> 01:10:11,200
Mima.

602
01:10:11,570 --> 01:10:12,970
I missed you.

603
01:10:13,170 --> 01:10:15,920
Shuppet, quick.
Use Shadow Ball!

604
01:10:22,730 --> 01:10:24,070
Zoroark!

605
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:36,610
Mima!

606
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:39,790
How dare you trick me!
For what you've done,

607
01:10:39,870 --> 01:10:41,530
you're going to pay!

608
01:10:58,630 --> 01:11:00,310
Yes, Zoroark!

609
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:06,220
You ok?
-We're here!

610
01:11:06,410 --> 01:11:08,170
Dawn and Brock!

611
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:14,760
Thanks, Bronzor!
Pikachu, Thunderbolt, let's go!

612
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:19,580
Pikachu, Volt Tackle!

613
01:11:24,910 --> 01:11:26,240
All right!

614
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:46,870
The Time Ripple...

615
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:49,550
The Time Ripple
will be mine!

616
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:11,120
Entei, Raikou, Suicune!
-Guardian protectors of the city!

617
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:12,410
Awesome!

618
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:16,590
Mima!

619
01:12:17,290 --> 01:12:19,400
Zoroark!
-Mima!

620
01:13:03,010 --> 01:13:05,920
Mima?
Mima?

621
01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:10,320
Wake up!
Mima!

622
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:21,560
Please, Zoroark,
hang in there!

623
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:26,190
You have to.
You finally found Zorua!

624
01:13:28,210 --> 01:13:31,620
Mima!
I promise, I'll get stronger.

625
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:34,510
I'll get strong,
like you, Mima.

626
01:13:44,590 --> 01:13:45,870
What's going on?

627
01:13:46,870 --> 01:13:49,000
This is Zorua's illusion!

628
01:13:49,570 --> 01:13:52,350
You're right.
This is Zorua's home.

629
01:13:52,630 --> 01:13:53,900
Zorua's home?

630
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:58,530
Mima!
Mima, let's go home together.

631
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:01,590
Mima!

632
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:30,350
Go on, Celebi!

633
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:39,350
Mima!

634
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:52,740
I knew you were stong, Mima.

635
01:15:53,430 --> 01:15:54,970
I knew it!

636
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,780
I'm so happy for Zorua.

637
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:05,950
It's all thanks to you.
-You were great, too.

638
01:16:09,030 --> 01:16:11,620
I'm so glad, you're
feeling better, Celebi.

639
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:44,420
Celebi, thanks for everything!

640
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:54,690
Celebi is about to Time Travel.

641
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:03,130
I'll be your friend forever.
-Yeah, so will we.

642
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:04,320
Yeah.

643
01:17:34,660 --> 01:17:37,580
Stop Kodai, all the
trees and flower will die!

644
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:42,530
What do I care!
So long, as my visionary powers grow,

645
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:45,600
it's all worth it!
-So, you don't care

646
01:17:45,780 --> 01:17:49,820
what happens to Crown City?
-It's true, that twenty years ago,

647
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,910
when I touched the Time Ripple,
Crown City withered,

648
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:57,140
But, no one knows
a thing about that.

649
01:17:57,410 --> 01:18:00,400
Just as no one will know,
what I've done today.

650
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:02,540
Such a terrible man!

651
01:18:02,690 --> 01:18:05,210
All anyone knows is
I'm doing my level best

652
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:08,370
to capture the evil
Pokemon, Zoroark.

653
01:18:11,630 --> 01:18:15,320
You can tell me all about it,
back at the precinct!

654
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:34,730
Have a great trip!

655
01:18:36,310 --> 01:18:39,690
You take good care!
-Come back again, anytime!

656
01:18:39,810 --> 01:18:41,740
Don't be strangers!

657
01:18:52,110 --> 01:18:54,440
Hey, Zorua!
Will you please,

658
01:18:54,530 --> 01:18:56,840
stop lookin'
like me, already?!

659
01:19:14,670 --> 01:19:15,950
Zorua!

660
01:19:22,610 --> 01:19:24,450
We promise, will
come and visit you

661
01:19:24,590 --> 01:19:26,880
in your region next,
Zorua!

662
01:19:28,050 --> 01:19:29,070
Ash...

663
01:19:29,260 --> 01:19:31,650
Count on it!
We can't wait!

664
01:20:04,210 --> 01:20:07,140
What would you two do,
if you could peer into the future?

665
01:20:07,420 --> 01:20:09,880
I'd be bored out
of my creative mind.

666
01:20:10,070 --> 01:20:12,220
Why, pretell?
-Not knowing, what will happen

667
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:14,810
is the spice of life.
The uncertainty of the future

668
01:20:14,950 --> 01:20:16,520
makes the here and now
a party.

669
01:20:16,710 --> 01:20:18,700
Hey, stop simplifying my stitch.

670
01:20:22,830 --> 01:20:26,110
Lovely breeze.
-A day of ease.

671
01:20:26,290 --> 01:20:29,990
Life's but a dream.
-Float down stream.

672
01:20:30,170 --> 01:20:33,420
And this time
in a boat!
