00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:32,689
Nice, easy mile now, warm it up!

3
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:35,452
- Take your time.
- Hurry up!

4
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:37,588
Aww.

5
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:41,797
It'd be so much cuter
if you were wearing little shoes.

6
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:43,700
It'd be cuter if he exploded at the end.

7
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,374
- Excuse me.
- Bless you.

8
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:49,432
- You know...
- Black lung.

9
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:51,238
Did you know that
pilgrims used to think sneezing

10
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:52,870
meant you were expelling demons?

11
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:55,648
- What?
- That's why I never sneeze.

12
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:57,239
I want to keep them all

13
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:58,785
- in my soul.
- Your soul.

14
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:01,115
If I had one.

15
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:02,245
<i>Twitter poll.</i>

16
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,416
If you could stay one age forever,
what would it be?

17
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:07,586
- Easy. 21.
- No way. I'd be 10.

18
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:09,322
Oh, no, 10 was the worst, man.

19
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,921
I say, 30. It's like
the height of sophistication.

20
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:13,990
- You?
- What about the age we are right now?

21
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,226
I'd like to stay like this forever.

22
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,464
Seriously? I mean,
what's wrong with you?

23
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:19,835
Okay, fine. The age we are right now,

24
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,738
but we could all live
in a house together.

25
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,242
Okay, fine. But without Wren, though?

26
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,005
Yeah, obviously,
that goes without saying.

27
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:26,839
Super funny. Like, whoa.

28
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,110
Guys,
the dudebros in their natural habitat.

29
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,743
Let's observe, shall we?

30
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,982
Hey, Tom! So, what's the plan tonight?

31
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,621
- Big plans...
- Hey.

32
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:41,627
- It's top secret.
- Oh, I see. A circle jerk?

33
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:44,931
- Hey, Chloe.
- Hey, Kyle.

34
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:47,157
So, what's the big secret?

35
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,029
I mean, I could tell you,

36
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:51,434
but then, I'd have to kill you.

37
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:52,666
- Okay, buddy.
- Yeah.

38
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,502
Yeah. It's very intriguing.

39
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,970
You guys, I got to go get my sister,
but I love you. Bye.

40
00:02:58,045 --> 00:02:59,479
See you later.
I'll pick you up tonight.

41
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:02,174
- I'm sorry.
- Bye. It's okay.

42
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,360
Bumped into Coach Sanders today.

43
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:22,300
Said your 1,600-meter time
is really improving.

44
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:27,969
All that training's paying off.

45
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,234
Nice work, sweetheart.

46
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:33,745
Did you tell them Delores Constantino
quit the team'?

47
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,870
<i>Why?</i>

48
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,850
She's pregnant.

49
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:42,151
What is she planning to do, now?

50
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,317
She's gonna drop out, and keep the baby.

51
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:52,089
I assume Wren is gonna be
at Katie's tonight?

52
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,328
Yeah. So?

53
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:55,831
So, what are you guys gonna do?

54
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:01,668
You know, drink a lot of vodka,
and meet guys online.

55
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:03,103
Funny. Very funny.

56
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:05,941
- Can I come?
- Not a chance.

57
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,446
- You said I could come next time.
- I lied.

58
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:17,084
- Hey.
- Hey.

59
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:19,090
Do you think
I could hang out with you guys?

60
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:23,093
Uh, yeah, not tonight, grasshopper.

61
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,925
Sorry. Maybe next time.

62
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,897
Oh, I wore the shirt
you gave me to school.

63
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,429
Got sent to the principal's office.

64
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,760
- Well done, man. Yes.
- Hey.

65
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:32,197
- Hey.
- Goodbye.

66
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,569
Bye.

67
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,301
Love me.

68
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:36,766
Bye, Lizzie.

69
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:02,963
- Hey.
- Hey.

70
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,902
Don't make any noise.
It's dormant.

71
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:08,998
Just another exciting Friday
night at the Jensen's.

72
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,443
No? On?

73
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:19,508
Yeah, it's girl gaze porn.

74
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:20,950
You know how they have POV porn?

75
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:22,785
- Yeah.
- This one's from our perspective.

76
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:24,119
- I don't want to see that.
- For sure.

77
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:26,915
Oh, my God.

78
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,318
Do you think she likes that?

79
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,126
- Oh, my God
- No!

80
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:32,325
Oh, God! Once you see it,
you just can't unsee it.

81
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:39,263
What the hell is he doing?

82
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:42,098
He's probably just
looking for another bottle.

83
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:44,634
- Sometimes, I wish I could just leave.
- I know.

84
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:48,341
Why don't we just all leave?
Get out of this stupid town together.

85
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:51,043
Where would we go?

86
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:54,849
I have friends in Paris.
We could totally stay with them.

87
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:56,946
What friends?
You've never been to Paris.

88
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,485
- My mom has friends there, idiot.
- Don't I wish.

89
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:04,396
I'll just be stuck here forever,
in this shithole.

90
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:13,202
Seriously! No, I think you
and Carl would make an adorable couple.

91
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,166
It's "Kyle," and I don't like him.

92
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:19,574
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever, you know.

93
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,670
But we all know that you wish you were

94
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:24,410
at their little secret sausage fest
right now.

95
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:25,678
No.

96
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,084
But I do know what their secret is.

97
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:31,149
Oh, yeah? Do tell.

98
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:33,486
So, they're getting together
tonight at Tom's house

99
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,552
in his garage, to summon Slender Man.

100
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:39,924
- Creepy.
- Who's Slender Man?

101
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:42,866
Yeah, he's the guy
who makes all those kids disappear.

102
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,370
Why have I not heard of this?

103
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,371
That's a much longer conversation.

104
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:49,274
- Listen.
- Troll...

105
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:52,402
"Slender Man can manifest
in a variety of forms.

106
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,882
"Certain accounts speak
of a hypnotic power

107
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:58,850
"that renders his victims helpless
to stop themselves

108
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:02,245
"from walking into waiting arms.

109
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,591
"While his origins and motives
are completely unknown,

110
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,594
"he preys upon innocent youth.

111
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:12,722
"Once you see him, you're his.

112
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:15,867
"Some he takes, some he doesn't.

113
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:21,474
"Nobody knows why he takes who he takes,
or why he leaves who he leaves.

114
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:26,943
"But the ones he leaves behind
are messed up forever."

115
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:32,249
All right, here it is.
"How to summon Slender Man."

116
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:39,723
- Guys, we so have to do this.
- We actually don't.

117
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:41,717
Actually.

118
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,627
If they're doing it, we're doing it.

119
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:45,626
This feels wrong. This feels like

120
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,430
Russian malware-y virus-type shit.

121
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,162
Come on, don't be such a wuss.

122
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:59,004
"Those who hear the three bells toll

123
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:00,978
"accept his invitation.

124
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,147
"When you hear the first,
you must close your eyes,

125
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:06,082
"keeping words unspoken.

126
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:09,415
"If one wants to hear,
you must listen closely,

127
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,316
"for they are soft and distant.

128
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:14,488
"With eyes still closed
and mind wide open,

129
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:17,625
"clear your thoughts
and await the second,

130
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:21,960
"opening your eyes
only once you've heard the third."

131
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:24,829
Hmm.

132
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:07,074
Are you serious? This is...

133
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,306
Shh!

134
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,259
What a stupid video. Honestly.

135
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,246
Can we do something else?

136
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:24,416
- Let's watch a movie.
- Yeah.

137
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,596
This burial ground dates back

138
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,431
all the way to the Revolutionary War,

139
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,939
which was 1775 to 1783.

140
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:26,770
In 2004, it was put on the
National Registry of Historical Sites,

141
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,177
which was very exciting.

142
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:32,610
Initially, all of this land
belonged to Thomas Clifton,

143
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:37,015
who left it to the town of Winsford
in his will in 1674.

144
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:43,590
You guys, I threw up twice
this morning, before I got on the bus.

145
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,523
Is it Carl's?

146
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:49,630
Ha. That's hilarious,
and also, scientifically impossible.

147
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,595
Have you been having nightmares?

148
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:53,763
Mmm-mmm.

149
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:55,136
Have you?

150
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:56,231
Uh...

151
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:58,133
About what?

152
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:02,812
It's nothing, really.
It's just that video.

153
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,550
Stronger and more
durable, which is also...

154
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:12,615
Hey, Katie?

155
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:16,225
Katie, are you okay?

156
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:18,424
Yes.

157
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:17,389
Katie? Cut this shit out, man.

158
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,959
All right, we're all prisoners
because of you.

159
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,820
So, none of you saw where she went?

160
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:23,658
- No.
- Really?

161
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:26,664
- Damn it.
- I mean, where is she?

162
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,861
Yeah, she still hasn't answered
any of my texts.

163
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,365
Why are the police here?

164
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,077
Oh, shit.

165
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,148
You see her'?

166
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:49,746
Mmm-mmm.

167
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:24,056
<i>Teenager
Katie Jensen was last seen on Wednesday,</i>

168
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,216
<i>during a school field trip
to the historic Clifton Cemetery.</i>

169
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,792
<i>As of now, local police have no leads,</i>

170
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,193
<i>but are questioning friends
and family members</i>

171
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:35,701
<i>in hopes of gaining insight
into the reason for her disappearance.</i>

172
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:40,035
<i>Citizens with any information are being
urged to contact local authorities.</i>

173
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:47,068
You should tell me
what really happened to Katie.

174
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:50,374
We never keep secrets from each other.

175
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,613
How would you know'?
You don't know that. Do your homework.

176
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:54,948
Come on, I don't want to talk about it.

177
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:59,222
It was a boy, right'?
You think I'll tell? I'd never tell.

178
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:01,454
You'd totally tell.

179
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:02,951
Not Mom and Dad.

180
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:04,560
Totally Mom and Dad.

181
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,223
Maybe.

182
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:09,228
Definitely,
but you get points for honesty.

183
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,301
So, tell me.

184
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:17,771
You don't know. Do you?

185
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,243
Just do your work, Lizzie.

186
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,304
- Hallie.
- Lizzie.

187
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,145
Fine.

188
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,424
I could stay home alone, you know.
I'm old enough.

189
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,460
Physical age, maybe.

190
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:56,204
Did you hear that?

191
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,317
Hey, Morn? Dad!

192
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,950
Hey, Mom?

193
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:09,786
Hallie, someone's in here.

194
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,456
Stay here. Okay? Don't move.

195
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:37,276
Hallie? Hallie, what is it? Hallie...

196
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,757
We called the police!

197
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:56,834
Katie? Katie?

198
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,334
<i>Police emergency.
Can I help you?</i>

199
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:00,631
Katie.

200
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,403
Katie, you here?

201
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:27,663
Mr. Jensen?

202
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:31,429
Where's my daughter?

203
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:33,768
I don't know.

204
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:40,140
- Is Katie here? Are you hiding her?
- No.

205
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:41,373
I don't know where she is.

206
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,688
It's all your fault.

207
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,717
She was never into this stuff.

208
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:54,191
- All this occult stuff.
- Hallie?

209
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:55,519
Lizzie, stay back.

210
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,187
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

211
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,800
- Where is she?
- No! Don't! Hallie!

212
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,131
- Where is my daughter?
- Hallie!

213
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,568
- Lizzie!
- Where is she?

214
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,898
Let's go.

215
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:13,301
- Stay the hell away from my family!
- Hey, hey, hey!

216
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,473
You hear me, Jensen?

217
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:51,775
Did you guys really try
and summon Slender Man?

218
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,275
<i>Why?</i>

219
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,610
We chickened out.

220
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:57,779
You chickened out.

221
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,119
- I chickened out?
- You chickened out.

222
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:00,381
- I remember you being the one...
- He chickened out.

223
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,549
That chickened out.

224
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,624
Katie's father
broke into my house last night.

225
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:07,731
- What?
- What?

226
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,531
He said something about Katie
being into the occult,

227
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,071
and then he blamed us
for getting her into it.

228
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:13,765
Wait, what did he mean about
Katie being into the occult?

229
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:15,398
I don't know. He was so wasted.

230
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:20,810
This could be
the next wrinkle in the story.

231
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:22,210
I don't want to play this game.

232
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:26,776
It's not a game. Katie's missing.

233
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:29,983
Yeah, and we know things
that nobody else knows.

234
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:31,579
What do we know?

235
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,281
We know that she watched that video.

236
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:37,222
Look, we all watched that video.
It didn't do anything.

237
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:39,959
When are we gonna admit
that Katie was kidnapped?

238
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:45,132
Somebody has her.

239
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:49,498
Yeah, but when we watched that video,
it affected all of us.

240
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:51,167
Something happened. I felt it.

241
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,344
- I didn't see anything.
- I didn't see anything, either.

242
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:58,111
Didn't say I saw it. I said I felt it.

243
00:21:58,851 --> 00:21:59,943
And I think you did, too.

244
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:03,848
And I'm damn sure that Katie felt it,

245
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,754
and that's why she disappeared!

246
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,337
This is a bad idea.

247
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:27,879
It's just a quick look around, okay?

248
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:31,712
Plus, you know what,
he's probably totally passed out by now.

249
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:34,783
I don't know, I just feel like
there's got to be something.

250
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,515
- You know, like a clue, maybe, or...
- You're crazy.

251
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:38,989
You don't realize how he was last night.

252
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,723
The back door is always unlocked
for when Katie gets home late.

253
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:47,464
Just saying.

254
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:53,397
Great. Then let's go.

255
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:23,362
Told ya.

256
00:23:39,018 --> 00:23:40,008
Wren?

257
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:42,914
Hi. Hi, Mr. Jensen.

258
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:59,102
What are you doing here?

259
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,763
Well, I just wanted to come down

260
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:05,708
and see if there was anything
that I could do, if I could help

261
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:07,979
in any way?

262
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:14,211
Anything I could do.

263
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:17,281
I miss her.

264
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:21,422
People just don't disappear.

265
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:27,062
You want to come in?

266
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:29,333
<i>Thaw be great.</i>

267
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,484
She's really gone.

268
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,327
The police must have taken her laptop.

269
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,004
What is all this?

270
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:35,529
She used to keep
cigarettes and stuff in here.

271
00:26:01,827 --> 00:26:02,885
Let's just take it.

272
00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:23,046
Okay.
Here's the last site she visited.

273
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,875
What am I looking at?

274
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:28,609
Here, click it.

275
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,411
Okay.

276
00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:54,973
Oh, shit.

277
00:26:56,415 --> 00:27:00,249
All these, like, town names,
and dates and stuff.

278
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:01,375
Click another one.

279
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,258
<i>Okay, guys. Let's go.</i>

280
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,790
<i>I am Slender Man.</i>

281
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:11,897
- Dude.
<i>- Guys,</i> guys.

282
00:27:12,164 --> 00:27:14,292
<i>Whoa, whoa.
What is that? What is that?</i>

283
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:16,324
<i>I'm so scared. I'm so...</i>

284
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:21,763
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

285
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:24,776
- Oh, God!
<i>- Dude, he's there!</i>

286
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:25,935
I can't...

287
00:27:27,913 --> 00:27:30,746
- It's him.
- I don't like this.

288
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:34,179
- Wait, look.
- What?

289
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:38,417
AleeyKat93.

290
00:27:39,925 --> 00:27:40,949
Jeez.

291
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:44,026
They went back and forth,
like, a gazillion times.

292
00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:48,764
"I knew he was there
before I saw him."

293
00:27:50,302 --> 00:27:52,600
It's like they're comparing experiences.

294
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:57,802
Wait, look. Katie posted a video.

295
00:27:57,943 --> 00:28:00,605
Look, it's from the night
before she disappeared.

296
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,733
- What was that?
- What did you see?

297
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:36,673
What did you see?

298
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:40,807
- I don't know, I...
- I don't know, either.

299
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:28,988
- I talked to her.
- Who?

300
00:30:29,094 --> 00:30:30,528
AleeyKat93.

301
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,927
It was that girl that Katie was
talking to on that website.

302
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:36,661
I messaged her, and she replied.

303
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:38,031
You went back on that website?

304
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:42,471
She told me everything.
He gets in your head like a virus.

305
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:43,531
What kind of virus?

306
00:30:43,642 --> 00:30:45,804
Like a computer virus
that infects your hard drive,

307
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:47,367
but instead of your hard drive,
it's your brain.

308
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:49,446
- Wren, you're gonna need to slow down...
- No, listen to me.

309
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:53,451
Once the virus takes hold,
he's got you. It's done.

310
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:56,044
Some he haunts, some he drives mad.

311
00:30:57,055 --> 00:31:00,548
- And others, he takes, like".
- Like what?

312
00:31:01,393 --> 00:31:03,157
Katie.

313
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,324
Listen, I know that this...

314
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,496
This is gonna sound crazy,

315
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:14,731
but AleeyKat said we can

316
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,707
"unveil ourselves."

317
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,504
Okay, if we just surrender
something to him

318
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:22,707
that has personal meaning,
something that we truly love.

319
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:23,872
What the hell does that mean?

320
00:31:25,851 --> 00:31:27,012
We can contact Slender Man.

321
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:29,352
Why would we do that?

322
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,917
To get Katie back. Hello?

323
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:35,259
Katie did it, and the next day,
she was just gone.

324
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,522
Okay, Katie asked Slender Man

325
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:39,325
- to take her?
- Yes.

326
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:41,428
Why would she do that?

327
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:45,567
I don't know. You know,
maybe she had an alcoholic father,

328
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:48,537
and maybe she hated her life,
and maybe she talked about

329
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,504
running away all the time, you know?

330
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:55,746
Guys, the police have no leads.

331
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:58,680
Right? Right?

332
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:03,711
So, even if the odds
are a million-to-one

333
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:06,715
that any of this is real, or that...

334
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:09,859
That he has anything to do
with Katie's disappearance,

335
00:32:10,729 --> 00:32:13,357
we owe it to her to try.

336
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,099
This should work.

337
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:30,274
I guess that I'll...

338
00:33:31,977 --> 00:33:34,275
Go first, then.

339
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:40,881
I...

340
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,948
I made <i>this in pottery class,
when</i> I <i>was five.</i>

341
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:47,318
This is a picture of me and my dad.

342
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,222
It's the only one I have
where we're together.

343
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:53,161
It was taken a few months
before he died.

344
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:56,232
My grandma made this
when Lizzie was born.

345
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:58,328
She died eight years ago.

346
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,649
Surprised you didn't bring
one of your trophies, or medals.

347
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:16,918
You said it had to be something
I cared about, so...

348
00:34:22,594 --> 00:34:24,358
I brought this.

349
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:36,768
Lights out.

350
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:51,517
Okay, so...

351
00:34:51,957 --> 00:34:54,790
Listen, once we ask for Katie's return,

352
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:58,089
we have to keep
these blindfolds on, all right?

353
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:01,229
AleeyKat said not to look in his face.

354
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:02,357
If you do,

355
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:04,393
you're messed up forever.

356
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:10,469
It's different for everyone,
but it only ends in insanity, or death.

357
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:16,872
Okay.

358
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:39,229
Okay, hold my hand, hold my hand.
You hold her hand, too, okay"?

359
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:41,329
We all have to hold hands.

360
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:46,667
How long do you think
we're gonna give this?

361
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:50,009
As long as it takes.

362
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:04,354
Keep your blindfolds on.

363
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:16,104
Do you hear that?

364
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,384
Guys, we shouldn't be doing this.

365
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:29,677
- She's right.
- It's too late.

366
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:01,046
- Chloe! Chloe!
- Chloe, come back!

367
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:02,745
- Come on! Chloe!
- Come back, Chloe!

368
00:37:30,782 --> 00:37:32,045
Chloe?

369
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:39,584
Hallie!

370
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:03,615
Oh, my God! Hallie.

371
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:04,978
- Where's Chloe?
- I don't know!

372
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:07,313
I told her to keep
her freaking blindfold on.

373
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:09,553
- She...
- Chloe!

374
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:36,346
- Oh, my God, Chloe!
- Chloe!

375
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:39,507
Jesus, Chloe, you scared us to death!
Where did you go?

376
00:38:42,187 --> 00:38:43,677
I lost my shoe.

377
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:45,445
It's okay.

378
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:48,415
What happened?

379
00:38:49,194 --> 00:38:51,288
- You saw him.
- Wren.

380
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,660
Chloe, I told you
not to take your blindfold off.

381
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:57,997
- Did you see him?
- Nothing happened.

382
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:01,434
I just got scared. Okay?

383
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:05,007
Something happened, and she knows it.
Something happened back there!

384
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:09,671
You're right. We didn't get Katie back.
That's what happened.

385
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:11,839
Come on.

386
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:18,155
Wait, guys. Wait for me.

387
00:39:58,596 --> 00:39:59,586
Hal?

388
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:01,521
Go away.

389
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:06,437
Are you okay?

390
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:09,268
I'm fine!

391
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:14,005
I'm fine! Just...
I'll see you later, okay?

392
00:40:15,947 --> 00:40:18,882
Just go to sleep.
We'll hang tomorrow, okay?

393
00:43:58,603 --> 00:43:59,900
Hey.

394
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:02,736
What's up with Chloe?
It's been a few days.

395
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:11,075
She's fine. Just a cold.

396
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:33,696
Hey, Hallie! Wait up.

397
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:38,007
- Hey.
- Hey.

398
00:44:38,209 --> 00:44:41,645
How you holding up?
I mean, with Katie and everything.

399
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:44,212
Um...

400
00:44:44,315 --> 00:44:47,512
Well, I'm okay. I...

401
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:50,450
Hey, tomorrows Friday.

402
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:53,013
We got the weekend coming up.

403
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:56,991
I was thinking,
maybe we should do something.

404
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:01,323
Yeah, sure.

405
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:06,837
You want to come over tomorrow night?
To my place?

406
00:45:15,413 --> 00:45:16,539
Hallie.

407
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:21,208
Hallie?

408
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:25,481
- What?
- Are you okay?

409
00:45:30,695 --> 00:45:33,187
Yeah, that's cool. Your place?

410
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:34,754
Sure.

411
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:38,696
I'll see you later?

412
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:40,731
Okay.

413
00:49:07,378 --> 00:49:11,144
Hallie. Hallie, can you...
Can you hear me? I...

414
00:49:34,405 --> 00:49:35,600
Hello?

415
00:50:27,725 --> 00:50:29,454
Oh, God.

416
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:13,495
Please! Please help!

417
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:25,113
No! No, no!

418
00:51:26,617 --> 00:51:28,449
No!

419
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:31,211
Please!

420
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:35,248
No, no!

421
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,724
<i>Miss,</i> are you all right?

422
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:20,332
- Are you okay?
- Oh, God.

423
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:34,643
I'm sorry.

424
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:37,849
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

425
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,131
Hey. Are you not
getting my texts, or something?

426
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:49,359
- Look, Wren, I don't...
- No, no, no.

427
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:52,595
Look at me. I found proof.
I found the proof. Right?

428
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:53,762
Look, look, look, I understand.

429
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:55,635
I understand now,
what AleeyKat was trying to tell me.

430
00:52:55,973 --> 00:52:58,101
It's proof. Read this.
Read this with me.

431
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:00,542
Okay, it says, "paranormal contact
with bioelectric systems

432
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:03,978
"often results
in a symbiotic relationship.

433
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:07,209
"The effects on host organisms
have been well documented and manifest

434
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:11,645
"in various forms, such as..."

435
00:53:11,722 --> 00:53:13,690
- Wren. Wren. Calm down.
- No, no, no.

436
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:17,122
Shh. Listen to me. "Personality
change, bizarre behavior,

437
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:20,994
"mental illness, psychosis,
<i>loss</i> of contact with reality,

438
00:53:21,065 --> 00:53:24,558
"self-mutilation, and suicide.

439
00:53:24,668 --> 00:53:28,798
"And nonspecific dissolution."

440
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:31,034
They just disappear.

441
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:34,504
Has...

442
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:41,007
Has anything weird happened
to you lately, or strange, or...

443
00:53:41,752 --> 00:53:43,550
Do not hold out on me.

444
00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:48,724
- Okay, so, I was talking with Tom...
- Tom?

445
00:53:48,826 --> 00:53:52,387
- What's wrong with Tom?
- What? Who gives a shit about Tom, Hal?

446
00:53:52,496 --> 00:53:53,725
- Just tell me what happened.
- Okay.

447
00:53:53,864 --> 00:53:56,925
I thought I saw something in the trees.

448
00:53:59,103 --> 00:54:00,730
It was him.

449
00:54:00,871 --> 00:54:03,363
And, what about Chloe?
Have you talked to her'?

450
00:54:03,674 --> 00:54:06,700
I don't know. I've called her house,
and her mom keeps telling me she's sick.

451
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:10,938
Last time I called, she pretty much
flat out told me to stay away.

452
00:54:13,217 --> 00:54:15,413
We need to go there right now.

453
00:54:15,552 --> 00:54:17,179
Wren, there's nothing we can do,
and I have track.

454
00:54:17,287 --> 00:54:19,722
- I can't just leave.
- Track?

455
00:54:22,126 --> 00:54:24,754
I thought you didn't care
about track anymore.

456
00:54:26,063 --> 00:54:27,588
I thought you cared about Chloe.

457
00:55:18,582 --> 00:55:19,606
Chloe.

458
00:55:30,627 --> 00:55:32,994
Chloe. Wake up.

459
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:37,100
What the hell was that'?

460
00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:40,126
I don't know, but I told...

461
00:55:40,204 --> 00:55:42,468
I knew that she saw his face
in the woods, you know?

462
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:44,803
I knew that she was lying, too.
I knew that.

463
00:55:44,875 --> 00:55:46,809
I don't want to do this anymore.

464
00:55:48,378 --> 00:55:51,006
Yeah, I don't, either.

465
00:55:51,481 --> 00:55:53,313
But I'm stuck in it.

466
00:55:53,984 --> 00:55:56,612
And you are, too.
You just don't realize it yet.

467
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:02,120
Don't look at me like that.
I'm not doing a "thing."

468
00:56:02,392 --> 00:56:03,553
All right.

469
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:09,063
"All right"?
Yeah, don't say "All right."

470
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:13,735
We only watched the website video.

471
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:18,133
But Chloe, she saw him in the woods.

472
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:22,643
- Wren, I can't keep...
- Read the book that I showed you.

473
00:56:22,813 --> 00:56:27,341
You will see the body count, okay?
Thousands of disappearances.

474
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:31,512
Search parties, faces on milk cartons.
I'm not making this shit up.

475
00:56:32,356 --> 00:56:36,054
And it all happened
exactly like AleeyKat said.

476
00:56:36,193 --> 00:56:38,525
It's probably some 50-year-old dude
living in his parents' basement,

477
00:56:38,595 --> 00:56:40,996
getting off on e-mailing
teenage girls every day.

478
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:43,189
Did you ever think of that? Did you?

479
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,333
So, you think that you can
just go back to real life?

480
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:49,337
Yeah, I do.
In fact, I have a real-life date

481
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:53,775
with real-life Tom tonight.
In real life.

482
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:56,005
He's not gonna stop!

483
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,605
And going on a date
with fucking Abercrombie Tom

484
00:56:58,715 --> 00:57:00,376
is not gonna change anything!

485
00:57:00,517 --> 00:57:03,179
You know I'm right!

486
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:09,415
You know I'm right.

487
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:24,363
- Hey.
- Hey.

488
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:26,492
Sorry I'm late.

489
00:58:26,603 --> 00:58:28,867
- No worries. Come on in.
- Thanks.

490
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,330
I thought I had the wrong house

491
00:58:31,441 --> 00:58:34,206
because there weren't any cars
in the driveway.

492
00:58:34,378 --> 00:58:38,611
Yeah, my dad's at this business thing,
and Mom's at her book club, so...

493
00:58:41,284 --> 00:58:42,877
<i>So, nobody' s home'?</i>

494
00:58:43,053 --> 00:58:46,045
No, it's just us. Is that okay?

495
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:49,553
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

496
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:01,899
I didn't know you were
such a music geek.

497
00:59:02,472 --> 00:59:03,633
Hmm.

498
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:14,343
So, this is my dad's, but I like it.

499
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:16,477
Cool.

500
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:24,660
Do you want me to put
something else on, or...

501
00:59:25,028 --> 00:59:29,226
- No. This is great.
- Okay. Cool.

502
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,634
- What?
- Do you hear that?

503
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:07,063
Yeah. It's good, right?

504
01:00:12,742 --> 01:00:13,732
Hey.

505
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:18,378
Hey, come here.

506
01:00:31,761 --> 01:00:32,785
What the hell?

507
01:00:34,764 --> 01:00:36,289
Hallie, I didn't do anything.

508
01:00:36,433 --> 01:00:39,459
I know. Oh, God.

509
01:00:40,737 --> 01:00:42,466
Are you okay?

510
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:47,641
Here.

511
01:00:52,082 --> 01:00:54,278
Have you told anyone else about this?

512
01:01:06,296 --> 01:01:08,924
If Katie was on some weird
Slender Man website, then

513
01:01:11,034 --> 01:01:13,366
who knows who she met? I mean...

514
01:01:15,205 --> 01:01:17,606
Probably some weird guy
in a van, you know?

515
01:01:19,142 --> 01:01:21,042
I hate to say it.

516
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:44,289
Is this it?

517
01:01:44,668 --> 01:01:46,727
- No, don't.
- Come on.

518
01:01:46,836 --> 01:01:49,669
Tom, please. You can't go on that site.

519
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:52,642
- It's just a video.
- It's not just a video.

520
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:54,473
Promise me
you won't ever watch that video.

521
01:01:55,345 --> 01:01:59,077
Tom, I'm serious. Please promise.

522
01:01:59,216 --> 01:02:02,652
Okay. Okay, I promise.

523
01:02:06,523 --> 01:02:08,423
Really.

524
01:02:17,867 --> 01:02:19,733
I need to go.

525
01:03:06,416 --> 01:03:08,783
All right, first,
let's all take a moment to observe...

526
01:03:08,885 --> 01:03:12,788
- Tom. Hey.
- The exterior anatomy here.

527
01:03:12,889 --> 01:03:15,881
Tom? Tom.

528
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:21,958
Hey. Are you okay?

529
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:34,134
Now, you'll notice that the cornea
looks a little cloudy and bluish.

530
01:03:34,577 --> 01:03:37,842
That happens naturally because
of the preservation process.

531
01:03:38,915 --> 01:03:40,815
So, very carefully, with your scalpels,

532
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:44,251
I want you to make a slice right through
the sclera as evenly as you can.

533
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:48,622
That's gonna separate
the anterior features of the eye.

534
01:04:59,162 --> 01:05:01,028
Hallie.

535
01:05:07,337 --> 01:05:10,170
- Katie?
- Hallie.

536
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,017
Hallie.

537
01:05:28,291 --> 01:05:29,918
Katie?

538
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:36,588
Hallie!

539
01:05:47,377 --> 01:05:50,972
- Help me, Hallie.
- Katie'?

540
01:06:09,499 --> 01:06:10,728
Katie?

541
01:06:14,437 --> 01:06:15,427
Hallie.

542
01:06:16,473 --> 01:06:17,463
Katie!

543
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:19,738
Katie, come back!

544
01:06:20,143 --> 01:06:21,736
Katie!

545
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:23,142
Katie!

546
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:24,945
Katie!

547
01:06:25,748 --> 01:06:27,238
Katie!

548
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:30,646
Katie!

549
01:06:34,023 --> 01:06:35,320
Katie!

550
01:06:36,593 --> 01:06:38,118
Hallie, help me.

551
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:20,186
Come on, breathe.

552
01:08:20,263 --> 01:08:21,594
You're gonna be okay.

553
01:08:21,698 --> 01:08:23,598
- Breathe...
- How long did they say?

554
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:26,032
- I don't know. Come on. Come on.
- It's gonna be okay.

555
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:28,070
- Just breathe, sweetheart.
Breathe, breathe.

556
01:08:28,137 --> 01:08:30,231
Come on. We got you.
We got you. Stay up.

557
01:08:30,306 --> 01:08:32,104
That's right, deep breath.

558
01:08:32,208 --> 01:08:33,607
- Just breathe. Deep breaths.
- Lizzie, what's going on?

559
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:35,369
Oh, my God. Lizzie!

560
01:08:35,445 --> 01:08:36,742
- The ambulance is on its way.
- Lizzie.

561
01:08:36,813 --> 01:08:38,247
Lizzie, it's okay. Just look at me.

562
01:08:38,314 --> 01:08:41,079
- We got you.
- It's okay, baby, ifs okay.

563
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:43,744
Okay, the ambulance
is on its way, honey.

564
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:45,413
No. No, Lizzie!

565
01:08:45,488 --> 01:08:47,582
- Lizzie, wake up! Lizzie!
- We're all here, Lizzie.

566
01:08:47,657 --> 01:08:49,216
- Dad, do something!
- Where is that ambulance?

567
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:51,317
- I'm doing my best. Come on, Lizzie!
- Lizzie, wake up!

568
01:08:51,427 --> 01:08:53,896
- Come on, Lizzie, just breathe.
- Lizzie, wake up!

569
01:09:14,183 --> 01:09:16,675
Blood tests are negative.
She's gonna be fine.

570
01:09:16,953 --> 01:09:19,752
They think it was just
some kind of panic attack.

571
01:09:19,856 --> 01:09:23,952
They want to keep her to monitor her
for at least another day.

572
01:11:51,073 --> 01:11:53,167
No. No.

573
01:11:53,276 --> 01:11:55,677
Lizzie? Lizzie?

574
01:11:58,648 --> 01:12:02,983
Lizzie! Lizzie!

575
01:12:03,186 --> 01:12:05,280
Lizzie!

576
01:12:06,355 --> 01:12:07,584
Lizzie, please.

577
01:12:12,795 --> 01:12:13,956
Lizzie?

578
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:48,895
Hallie?

579
01:12:51,234 --> 01:12:52,724
<i>Hallie?</i>

580
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:55,534
Hallie, are you okay?

581
01:12:58,474 --> 01:12:59,566
What's the matter?

582
01:12:59,675 --> 01:13:01,040
Sweetheart, what's going on?

583
01:13:01,143 --> 01:13:05,478
Hey. She's okay. She's okay.

584
01:13:05,548 --> 01:13:08,643
It's all right. She's gonna be fine.

585
01:13:41,617 --> 01:13:46,214
<i>Dr. Barnes, 4721.
Dr. Barnes, 4721.</i>

586
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:55,955
- BP 80/40.
- Let's get her moving.

587
01:13:56,065 --> 01:13:57,726
- Lizzie!
- Get her moving.

588
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,290
- Lizzie!
- Let's get her moving.

589
01:13:59,602 --> 01:14:01,764
- Where are they taking her?
- I've got to get her to the ICU.

590
01:14:01,971 --> 01:14:03,700
- Lizzie!
- He had no face.

591
01:14:04,407 --> 01:14:08,241
He had no face! He had no face!

592
01:14:08,311 --> 01:14:09,642
He had no face!

593
01:14:12,214 --> 01:14:13,409
Lizzie!

594
01:14:57,193 --> 01:14:58,490
<i>Okay. So, now, what do I do?</i>

595
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:06,330
<i>Just sacrifice something you love.</i>

596
01:15:24,553 --> 01:15:26,043
Wren!

597
01:15:29,458 --> 01:15:32,223
Damn it, Wren! I know you're in there!

598
01:15:34,063 --> 01:15:35,292
Open up!

599
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,518
Wren!

600
01:16:12,701 --> 01:16:14,226
Wren!

601
01:16:32,388 --> 01:16:33,378
Wren!

602
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:02,839
Wren, what are you doing?

603
01:18:05,381 --> 01:18:07,509
Wren, take my hand. Come on.

604
01:18:08,284 --> 01:18:11,345
Wren, you're gonna fall! Wren.

605
01:18:22,398 --> 01:18:23,490
Wren!

606
01:18:27,670 --> 01:18:28,660
I'm sorry.

607
01:18:28,737 --> 01:18:33,140
You're sorry? That's it'?
That's my sister! Why would you do that?

608
01:18:33,809 --> 01:18:35,709
She came to me.

609
01:18:35,811 --> 01:18:38,178
- Wren, she's in the hospital!
- She came to me.

610
01:18:40,683 --> 01:18:42,173
It was before I knew.

611
01:18:43,185 --> 01:18:47,418
To get Lizzie back, to make him stop,

612
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:53,218
you can't just
give him something you love.

613
01:18:55,431 --> 01:18:57,024
It's not enough.

614
01:18:58,901 --> 01:19:00,266
He wants us!

615
01:19:03,205 --> 01:19:05,037
He wants us!

616
01:19:21,890 --> 01:19:22,880
Hello?

617
01:19:28,564 --> 01:19:29,588
No.

618
01:19:32,201 --> 01:19:35,637
That's here. That's here.

619
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:46,746
Wait, wait, Hallie!

620
01:20:08,604 --> 01:20:10,003
No.

621
01:20:33,796 --> 01:20:36,094
Wren! Wren!

622
01:20:45,374 --> 01:20:47,968
<i>To get Lizzie back...</i>

623
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:50,543
He had no face!

624
01:20:52,448 --> 01:20:53,973
To make him stop...

625
01:20:54,283 --> 01:20:56,012
Hallie, are you okay?

626
01:20:58,354 --> 01:21:01,654
<i>You can't just give him
something you love.</i>

627
01:21:03,892 --> 01:21:05,189
<i>He wants us!</i>

628
01:21:06,829 --> 01:21:08,490
<i>He wants us!</i>

629
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:11,113
Take me.

630
01:25:12,407 --> 01:25:14,307
Lizzie!

631
01:25:31,093 --> 01:25:33,118
Hallie! No!

632
01:25:33,495 --> 01:25:36,396
Hallie! Hallie! No!

633
01:25:36,465 --> 01:25:38,832
- Honey! It's okay!
- Hallie! No! No!

634
01:25:38,934 --> 01:25:39,924
It's okay.

635
01:25:40,002 --> 01:25:42,733
- Nurse! Somebody help us!
- Hallie! Hallie!

636
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:44,829
- Hallie!
- Can we get a nurse in here?

637
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:46,635
No! No! No!

638
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:47,934
Right here.

639
01:25:48,010 --> 01:25:49,808
<i>Hallie! No!</i>

640
01:25:50,078 --> 01:25:54,140
<i>Hallie, Katie, Chloe, Wren.</i>

641
01:25:55,350 --> 01:25:57,512
<i>There's almost always a pattern.</i>

642
01:25:58,153 --> 01:26:01,612
<i>He only shows himself
just enough to infect us.</i>

643
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:06,321
<i>The more fear he creates,
the more fascinated we get.</i>

644
01:26:06,795 --> 01:26:10,095
<i>We talk and write about him,
share pictures, dick on finks,</i>

645
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:13,601
<i>Photoshop images.
That's how a virus works.</i>

646
01:26:13,702 --> 01:26:15,932
That's how it spreads.

647
01:26:16,538 --> 01:26:20,497
<i>And some people cross the line
and actually seek him out,</i>

648
01:26:20,642 --> 01:26:23,509
<i>like my sister and her friends did.</i>

649
01:26:23,979 --> 01:26:27,210
<i>And those messed-up people
go out and do messed-up things</i>

650
01:26:27,315 --> 01:26:30,046
<i>that become more stories
for people to tell.</i>

651
01:26:31,953 --> 01:26:34,684
<i>Ifs all spreading his word. You know?</i>

652
01:26:54,476 --> 01:26:56,035
<i>We know he abducts people.</i>

653
01:26:59,247 --> 01:27:01,409
<i>I started getting
a ringing in my ears.</i>

654
01:27:13,929 --> 01:27:15,397
<i>It's the thing that we fear.</i>

655
01:27:18,033 --> 01:27:20,434
<i>There?! been reports
of strange lights coming from the woods.</i>

656
01:27:23,271 --> 01:27:25,569
<i>Viral nature of his
ever-expanding reach and influence.</i>

657
01:27:28,543 --> 01:27:30,910
I keep having nightmares
about his pale face.

658
01:27:34,716 --> 01:27:37,276
<i>Pictures include variations
of a thin man with a blanked-out face.</i>

659
01:27:40,122 --> 01:27:41,112
He seduces them.

660
01:27:42,305 --> 01:28:42,769
