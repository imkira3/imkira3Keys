What do you want?

00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:58,758
I want the Turbo Man action figure
with the arms and legs that move...

159
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,553
and the boomerang shooter
and the rock-and-roar jet pack...

160
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:05,724
and the realistic voice activator
that says five different phrases...

including, "It's turbo time!"

Yeah.

that you did not forget that doll.

No, no. I-Iâ€” I got it.

has those things that shoot out in front...

with that rock 'em

"It's turbo time."

- Oh, good.

you thought for a minute...

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,603
that I would not do something
that you tell me?

187

I got it right away.

down there and set him free

If nature's kind, they'll take him
