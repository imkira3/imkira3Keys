00:00:25,027 --> 00:00:27,697
¶ Love

2
00:00:27,822 --> 00:00:32,283
¶ Is a many splendoured thing

3
00:01:10,491 --> 00:01:12,947
I'm going to Australia,
I won't see you again.

4
00:01:13,077 --> 00:01:15,070
Don't talk that way, Sandy.

5
00:01:15,205 --> 00:01:16,863
But it's true.

6
00:01:16,997 --> 00:01:21,993
I've had the best summer of my life.
Now I have to go away. It isn't fair.

7
00:01:31,138 --> 00:01:35,883
- Danny, don't spoil it.
- Sandy, it's only making it better.

8
00:01:36,018 --> 00:01:38,223
Danny, is this the end?

9
00:01:38,353 --> 00:01:40,013
Of course not.

10
00:01:41,648 --> 00:01:43,107
It's only the beginning.

11
00:01:43,567 --> 00:01:45,690
This is the main brain,
Vince Fontaine,

12
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,393
beginning your day the only way.
Music, music.

13
00:01:48,531 --> 00:01:50,024
Get out of bed, first day of school.

14
00:01:50,157 --> 00:01:53,407
Don't be a slob, don't get a job,
go back to class, you can pass.

15
00:01:53,535 --> 00:01:57,368
To start the day off nice and fine,
here's a new old favourite of mine.

16
00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:01,120
¶ I solve my problems
and I see the light

17
00:02:01,252 --> 00:02:03,411
¶ We got a lovin' thing

18
00:02:03,546 --> 00:02:05,918
¶ We got to feed it right

19
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,299
¶ There ain't no danger
we can go too far

20
00:02:10,428 --> 00:02:12,468
¶ We start believin' now

21
00:02:12,597 --> 00:02:14,673
¶ That we can be who we are

22
00:02:14,808 --> 00:02:16,847
¶ Grease is the word

23
00:02:20,355 --> 00:02:23,641
¶ They think our love
is just a growin'pain

24
00:02:23,775 --> 00:02:25,851
¶ Why don't they understand?

25
00:02:25,986 --> 00:02:28,655
¶ It's just a cryin' shame

26
00:02:29,114 --> 00:02:32,400
¶ Their lips are lying,
only real is real

27
00:02:32,535 --> 00:02:34,823
¶ We stop the fight right now

28
00:02:34,953 --> 00:02:36,910
¶ We got to be what we feel

29
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,664
¶ Grease is the word

30
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,413
¶ Is the word,
is the word that you've heard

31
00:02:41,544 --> 00:02:44,710
¶ It's got groove, it's got meaning

32
00:02:46,715 --> 00:02:51,094
¶ Grease is the time,
is the place, is the motion

33
00:02:51,221 --> 00:02:54,921
¶ Grease is the way we are feelin'

34
00:02:58,102 --> 00:03:01,269
¶ We take the pressure
and we throw away

35
00:03:01,398 --> 00:03:03,356
¶ Conventionality

36
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:06,226
¶ Belongs to yesterday

37
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:10,071
¶ There is a chance
that we can make it so far

38
00:03:10,198 --> 00:03:12,440
¶ We start believin' now

39
00:03:12,576 --> 00:03:14,735
¶ That we can be who we are

40
00:03:14,871 --> 00:03:16,199
¶ Grease is the word

41
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,117
¶ Is the word,
is the word that you've heard

42
00:03:19,249 --> 00:03:22,251
¶ It's got groove, it's got meaning

43
00:03:24,547 --> 00:03:28,415
¶ Grease is the time,
is the place, is the motion

44
00:03:28,551 --> 00:03:32,680
¶ Now grease is the way
we are feelin'

45
00:03:33,764 --> 00:03:36,007
¶ This is a life of illusion

46
00:03:36,643 --> 00:03:38,850
¶ Wrapped up in troubles

47
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:40,438
¶ Laced in confusion

48
00:03:40,563 --> 00:03:43,933
¶ What are we doing here?

49
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:47,896
¶ We take the pressure
and we throw away

50
00:03:48,029 --> 00:03:50,106
¶ Conventionality

51
00:03:50,241 --> 00:03:52,696
¶ Belongs to yesterday

52
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,861
¶ There is a chance
that we can make it so far

53
00:03:56,997 --> 00:03:58,955
¶ We start believin' now

54
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,040
¶ That we can be who we are

55
00:04:01,502 --> 00:04:02,783
¶ Grease is the word

56
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:05,837
¶ Is the word,
is the word that you've heard

57
00:04:05,964 --> 00:04:09,168
¶ It's got groove, it's got meaning

58
00:04:11,096 --> 00:04:15,638
¶ Grease is the time,

¶ Grease is the way we are feelin'

60
00:04:34,453 --> 00:04:38,154
¶ Grease is the word,
is the word that you've heard

61
00:04:38,289 --> 00:04:40,864
¶ It's got groove, it's got meaning

62
00:04:43,296 --> 00:04:47,340
¶ Grease is the time,
is the place, is the motion

63
00:04:47,467 --> 00:04:51,084
¶ Grease is the way we are feelin'

64
00:04:54,265 --> 00:04:58,264
¶ Grease is the word,
is the word, is the word

65
00:05:10,157 --> 00:05:13,491
- You don't eat this, you bury it.
- That's a home-made lunch.

66
00:05:13,619 --> 00:05:16,110
Your old lady drag her carcass
out of bed for you?

67
00:05:16,247 --> 00:05:19,367
- She does it first day of school.
- Big deal.

68
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,284
- Kenickie. Over here.
- Where you at?

69
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:27,083
We're right here.

70
00:05:27,216 --> 00:05:29,886
- Where were you all summer?
- Are you my mother?

71
00:05:30,011 --> 00:05:33,426
- Just askin'.
- Working. More than you can say.

72
00:05:33,556 --> 00:05:36,972
- Working?
- Yes, lugging boxes at Bargain City.

73
00:05:37,102 --> 00:05:39,474
- Nice job.
- Eat me.

74
00:05:39,604 --> 00:05:41,561
I'm saving up to get me some wheels.

75
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,432
- Wanna hear what I did?
- No.

76
00:05:43,566 --> 00:05:45,773
Hey, there's Danny.

77
00:05:46,611 --> 00:05:48,651
Danny! Danny!

78
00:06:02,503 --> 00:06:04,579
You seen any new broads there?

79
00:06:04,714 --> 00:06:08,248
Nah, same old chicks,
everybody's made them.

80
00:06:08,384 --> 00:06:10,460
So what'd you do all summer?

81
00:06:10,594 --> 00:06:13,264
I was hanging around at the beach.
You know.

82
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:16,307
It's tough with all those chicks
hanging around you.

83
00:06:16,434 --> 00:06:20,479
The only thing
that hangs around you are the flies.

84
00:06:20,605 --> 00:06:23,642
How was the action
at the beach, man?

85
00:06:23,942 --> 00:06:26,267
Whew. It was flipping.

86
00:06:26,403 --> 00:06:28,145
Yeah? Crazy?

87
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:32,657
I did meet this one chick.
She was sorta cool.

88
00:06:32,784 --> 00:06:34,943
You mean she puts out?

89
00:06:35,078 --> 00:06:38,246
Come on, Sonny,
is that all you think about?

90
00:06:38,374 --> 00:06:41,078
- Freakin' A.
- (bell)

91
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:44,336
Hey, guys, wait up.

92
00:06:44,463 --> 00:06:47,251
- Do I look OK, Frenchy?
- Sure, you look good.

93
00:06:47,383 --> 00:06:50,716
- I'm really nervous.
- You look terrific.

94
00:06:50,845 --> 00:06:54,759
- So, this is Rydell?
- Yep. You'll love it.

95
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:58,723
I loved the last school I was at.
I wish I was there right now.

96
00:06:58,853 --> 00:07:01,344
Still, I'm no stranger to heartbreak.

97
00:07:01,481 --> 00:07:03,805
Why? You got psoriasis?

98
00:07:07,111 --> 00:07:08,606
(car backfires)

99
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,958
Well, here we are again.

100
00:07:24,088 --> 00:07:28,002
- But this time we're seniors.
- We're gonna rule the school.

101
00:07:28,133 --> 00:07:30,008
(all laugh)

102
00:07:30,135 --> 00:07:31,963
Jan, that is so adolescent.

103
00:07:32,096 --> 00:07:35,631
- We are adolescent.
- We don't have to flaunt it.

104
00:07:35,766 --> 00:07:37,308
OK, girls.

105
00:07:37,435 --> 00:07:39,178
Let's go get 'em.

106
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,393
Blanche, do you have
the new schedules?

107
00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:50,234
Yes, Miss McGee,
I just had my hands on them.

108
00:07:50,365 --> 00:07:53,236
Oh, good, they'll be
nice and smudged.

109
00:07:53,369 --> 00:07:57,117
Here we are. If it had been a snake,
it would've bitten me.

110
00:07:58,498 --> 00:08:01,832
These are the schedules
we couldn't find last semester.

111
00:08:01,961 --> 00:08:04,416
Next year,
you might find this semester's.

112
00:08:12,346 --> 00:08:16,296
- I've got Kenickie again.
- He's been here longer than I have.

113
00:08:16,434 --> 00:08:20,680
First day of school and already
my castor oil is missing.

114
00:08:21,647 --> 00:08:24,221
How many days
till Christmas vacation?

115
00:08:24,358 --> 00:08:25,474
86.

116
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,567
- 86?
- And counting.

117
00:08:29,364 --> 00:08:31,771
- Can I help you?
- Yes, it's my first day.

118
00:08:31,908 --> 00:08:35,490
- I'm not sure where I should be.
- Welcome to Rydell.

119
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,407
You'll have to fill out
these forms, but...

120
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:41,209
Excuse me a minute.
I'll be right back.

121
00:08:43,044 --> 00:08:47,374
- Do you have a pencil, please?
- Yes, dear. There you are.

122
00:08:48,258 --> 00:08:49,753
(bell)

123
00:08:56,892 --> 00:09:00,641
Jeez. Every teacher I got this year
has flunked me at least once.

124
00:09:00,772 --> 00:09:03,227
You'll spend your time
in McGee's office.

125
00:09:03,358 --> 00:09:07,521
- She'll wish she'd never seen me.
- Yeah? And what are you gonna do?

126
00:09:07,654 --> 00:09:11,568
I just ain't gonna take her crap.
I don't take no crap from nobody.

127
00:09:11,699 --> 00:09:13,988
- Sonny?
- Oh, hello, ma'am.

128
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:17,202
- Shouldn't you be in home room?
- I was going for a walk.

129
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,489
- You were dawdling.
- Yes, ma'am.

130
00:09:19,624 --> 00:09:23,159
That is no way to start
a new semester, Mr LaTierri.

131
00:09:23,295 --> 00:09:24,706
(mutters in Italian)

132
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:29,381
Perhaps a session of banging erasers
after school would put you on track.

133
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:30,969
Yes, ma'am.

134
00:09:31,095 --> 00:09:34,927
- Do you plan to stand there all day?
- No, ma'am. I mean, yes.

135
00:09:35,057 --> 00:09:36,967
- Well, which is it?
- No, ma'am.

136
00:09:37,102 --> 00:09:39,343
- Good. Then move.
- Yes, ma'am.

137
00:09:41,939 --> 00:09:44,775
I'm glad you didn't take
any of her crap, Sonny.

138
00:09:44,901 --> 00:09:46,727
You would have told her off, huh?

139
00:09:46,861 --> 00:09:49,945
Mr LaTierri.
Yes, ma'am, no, ma'am...

140
00:09:50,072 --> 00:09:51,068
Hey, Eugene.

141
00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:53,191
How you doin'?

142
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,568
- Shake, buddy.
- (buzzing)

143
00:09:56,121 --> 00:09:58,790
What's wrong?
You're wearing glasses.

144
00:09:58,915 --> 00:10:00,991
- I got an astigmatism.
- Too bad.

145
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:08,294
(students) ¶ As I go travelling down
life's highway

146
00:10:08,843 --> 00:10:13,468
¶ Whatever course my fortunes
may foretell...

147
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,047
(chimes)

148
00:10:18,186 --> 00:10:21,886
Good morning, boys and girls.
Welcome to what we're sure will be

149
00:10:22,023 --> 00:10:24,146
our greatest year at Rydell.

150
00:10:24,275 --> 00:10:27,691
Saturday night will be
our first pep rally and bonfire.

151
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,394
I want to see all of you students
out there,

152
00:10:30,532 --> 00:10:35,277
with plenty of support for Coach
Calhoun and the Rydell Rangers.

153
00:10:35,411 --> 00:10:39,575
If you can't be an athlete,
be an athletic supporter.

154
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:42,533
And now for the really good news.

155
00:10:42,669 --> 00:10:44,662
One of the most exciting things

156
00:10:44,797 --> 00:10:47,501
to ever happen at Rydell High.

157
00:10:47,632 --> 00:10:50,420
National Bandstand television show

158
00:10:50,552 --> 00:10:55,013
has selected Rydell as
a representative American high school

159
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,758
and will do a live broadcast
from our very own gym.

160
00:10:58,894 --> 00:11:00,518
(cheering)

161
00:11:00,646 --> 00:11:03,481
It is our chance
to show the entire nation

162
00:11:03,607 --> 00:11:06,277
what fine, bright, clean-cut,

163
00:11:06,402 --> 00:11:10,530
wholesome students
we have here at Rydell.

164
00:11:11,491 --> 00:11:12,819
(screams)

165
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,082
¶ Ba, ba, bamba

166
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,166
¶ Ba, ba, bamba

167
00:11:24,254 --> 00:11:26,081
¶ La, la, la, la, la bamba

168
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:30,669
Did you guys get a look
at Zuko this mornin'?

169
00:11:31,344 --> 00:11:33,918
Lookin' pretty good this year,
huh, Rizz?

170
00:11:34,056 --> 00:11:38,304
- That's ancient history.
- History sometimes repeats itself.

171
00:11:38,436 --> 00:11:40,891
- Hey, you guys.
- Hi, Frenchy.

172
00:11:41,021 --> 00:11:45,066
Go sit down.
This here is Sandy Olsen.

173
00:11:45,192 --> 00:11:48,146
And that's Jan and Marty,
and this is Rizzo.

174
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:51,114
She just moved here
from Sydney, Australia.

175
00:11:51,574 --> 00:11:55,275
- How are things down under?
- Oh, fine, thanks.

176
00:11:57,413 --> 00:11:59,157
Marty, are those new glasses?

177
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:02,292
Yeah, just for school.
Do they make me look smarter?

178
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,577
Nah, you can still see your face.

179
00:12:04,713 --> 00:12:08,213
- How d'you like school, Sandy?
- It's different.

180
00:12:08,342 --> 00:12:10,833
- Hi, kids.
- (all groan)

181
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,722
Patty Simcox,
the bad seed of Rydell. Hi.

182
00:12:13,848 --> 00:12:17,217
- I love the first day of school.
- The biggest thrill of my life.

183
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:20,056
- You won't guess what's happened.
- Probably not.

184
00:12:20,188 --> 00:12:22,346
The nominees for Student Council
are out.

185
00:12:22,482 --> 00:12:24,770
- Guess who's up for Vice President?
- Who?

186
00:12:24,901 --> 00:12:26,643
Me. Isn't that the most?

187
00:12:26,777 --> 00:12:28,770
- To say the least.
- The very least.

188
00:12:28,905 --> 00:12:30,862
I hope I don't make a poor showing.

189
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,861
We wish you the best of luck,
don't we, girls?

190
00:12:33,993 --> 00:12:35,737
I've got my fingers crossed.

191
00:12:36,912 --> 00:12:40,745
Oh, you must think I'm a clod
for not introducing myself.

192
00:12:40,876 --> 00:12:43,248
Hi, I'm Patty Simcox.

193
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,543
Welcome to Rydell. (squeals)

194
00:12:50,176 --> 00:12:54,340
Will you be at cheerleader tryouts?
We'll be lifelong friends.

195
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:57,011
You guys, how do you like Sandy?

196
00:12:57,142 --> 00:12:59,715
Do you think we can
let her in the Pink Ladies?

197
00:13:01,021 --> 00:13:04,391
- She looks too pure to be pink.
- Ohh, double do-do!

198
00:13:04,525 --> 00:13:05,639
What's up, doc?

199
00:13:05,776 --> 00:13:08,481
One of my diamonds
just fell in the macaroni.

200
00:13:10,197 --> 00:13:12,439
Kenickie, want a piece of salami?

201
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,196
Are you kidding?
If I eat that, I'll smell like you.

202
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:16,952
What a stink!

203
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:18,658
Hey, guys, look.

204
00:13:20,542 --> 00:13:23,993
Ladies and gentlemen,
dingleberries on parade.

205
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,463
Look! You really put
your foot into it this time.

206
00:13:29,593 --> 00:13:32,166
Try hopscotch, you hot dog.

207
00:13:33,138 --> 00:13:36,139
What a gavone! Gumdrops, man.

208
00:13:39,603 --> 00:13:42,807
Any of you guys see
that new chick in registration?

209
00:13:42,941 --> 00:13:45,016
Sure beats
the foam domes round here.

210
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,774
Jugs bigger than Annette's?

211
00:13:46,902 --> 00:13:50,188
Nobody's jugs
are bigger than Annette's.

212
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:57,159
Hey, guys. Hey!

213
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,083
Hi, girls.

214
00:14:02,544 --> 00:14:04,370
You're a sick man, Putz.

215
00:14:07,757 --> 00:14:10,841
Hey, I wanna hear about
what Danny did at the beach.

216
00:14:11,511 --> 00:14:15,011
- It was nothing.
- Sure, nothing, Zuko. Right?

217
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:18,224
- You got in her drawers, right?
- Come on, tell us.

218
00:14:18,352 --> 00:14:19,810
What did you do this summer?

219
00:14:19,936 --> 00:14:23,222
I spent most of it at the beach.
I met a boy there.

220
00:14:23,357 --> 00:14:26,062
You hauled your cookies
to the beach for a guy?

221
00:14:26,193 --> 00:14:29,562
- He was sorta special.
- There ain't no such thing.

222
00:14:30,906 --> 00:14:32,365
It was really romantic.

223
00:14:32,491 --> 00:14:34,817
Everything about it.

224
00:14:34,952 --> 00:14:37,870
You don't want to hear
the horny details.

225
00:14:37,997 --> 00:14:39,621
Alright, I'll tell you.

226
00:14:40,082 --> 00:14:43,783
¶ Summer lovin', had me a blast

227
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,704
¶ Summer lovin', happened so fast

228
00:14:47,841 --> 00:14:51,210
¶ I met a girl, crazy for me

229
00:14:51,761 --> 00:14:54,631
¶ Met a boy, cute as can be

230
00:14:55,515 --> 00:14:58,801
¶ Summer days, drifting away

231
00:14:58,936 --> 00:15:01,178
¶ To uh, oh, those summer nights

232
00:15:01,313 --> 00:15:03,352
¶ Wella, wella, wella, huh

233
00:15:03,481 --> 00:15:07,064
¶ Tell me more, tell me more
Did you get very far?

234
00:15:07,194 --> 00:15:10,860
- ¶ Tell me more, tell me more
- ¶ Like does he have a car?

235
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:14,573
- ¶ Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
- ¶ Do-do, do-do, do-do-do-do

236
00:15:14,702 --> 00:15:18,616
¶ She swam by me, she got a cramp

237
00:15:18,747 --> 00:15:22,164
¶ He ran by me, got my suit damp

238
00:15:22,711 --> 00:15:26,328
¶ I saved her life,
she nearly drowned

239
00:15:26,464 --> 00:15:29,798
¶ He showed off, splashing around

240
00:15:30,426 --> 00:15:33,297
¶ Summer sun, something's begun

241
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:36,002
¶ But uh, oh, those summer nights

242
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,801
¶ Wella, wella, wella, huh

243
00:15:37,934 --> 00:15:41,932
- ¶ Tell me more, tell me more
- ¶ Was it love at first sight?

244
00:15:42,063 --> 00:15:45,813
- ¶ Tell me more, tell me more
- ¶ Did she put up a fight?

245
00:15:45,943 --> 00:15:49,608
¶ Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
¶ Doobie-doo, doobie-doo, doobie-dum

246
00:15:49,738 --> 00:15:53,985
¶ Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
¶ Doobie-doo, doobie-doo, doobie-dum

247
00:15:54,118 --> 00:15:57,452
¶ Took her bowling in the arcade

248
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:01,412
¶ We went strolling, drank lemonade

249
00:16:01,542 --> 00:16:04,912
¶ We made out, under the dock

250
00:16:05,046 --> 00:16:08,462
¶ We stayed out till ten o'clock

251
00:16:09,341 --> 00:16:12,758
¶ Summer fling, don't mean a thing

252
00:16:12,887 --> 00:16:16,387
¶ But uh, oh, those summer nights

253
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:20,759
- ¶ Tell me more, tell me more
- ¶ But you don't gotta brag

254
00:16:20,895 --> 00:16:22,770
¶ Tell me more, tell me more

255
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,725
¶ Cos he sounds like a drag

256
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:29,315
¶ Shuda-bop-bop, shuda-bop-bop
Shuda-bop-bop, shuda-bop-bop

257
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:33,029
¶ Shuda-bop-bop, shuda-bop-bop
Shuda-bop-bop, yeah!

258
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:37,076
¶ He got friendly, holding my hand

259
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:41,333
¶ She got friendly, down in sand

260
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:44,993
¶ He was sweet, just turned 1 8

261
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:48,296
¶ Well, she was good,
you know what I mean

262
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:52,046
¶ Summer heat, boy and girl meet

263
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:55,096
¶ But uh, oh, those summer nights

264
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:56,883
¶ Whoa, whoa, whoa

265
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:00,682
- ¶ Tell me more, tell me more
- ¶ How much dough did he spend?

266
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:04,975
- ¶ Tell me more, tell me more
- ¶ Could she get me a friend?

267
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:12,274
¶ It turned colder,
that's where it ends

268
00:17:12,909 --> 00:17:17,486
¶ So I told her we'd still be friends

269
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:23,538
¶ Then we made our true love vow

270
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:30,840
¶ Wonder what she's doing now

271
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:35,839
¶ Summer dreams

272
00:17:35,974 --> 00:17:40,220
¶ Ripped at the seams

273
00:17:41,187 --> 00:17:43,345
¶ But

274
00:17:43,481 --> 00:17:45,273
¶ Oh

275
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:50,441
¶ Those summer

276
00:17:51,532 --> 00:17:55,030
¶ Nights

277
00:17:55,744 --> 00:18:00,868
¶ Tell me more, tell me more

278
00:18:09,259 --> 00:18:11,216
He sounds real nice.

279
00:18:11,344 --> 00:18:14,760
True love and he didn't lay
a hand on you? Sounds like a creep.

280
00:18:14,889 --> 00:18:17,261
He wasn't. He was a gentleman.

281
00:18:17,392 --> 00:18:19,016
What was his name?

282
00:18:19,143 --> 00:18:20,971
Danny. Danny Zuko.

283
00:18:21,105 --> 00:18:22,515
(all giggle)

284
00:18:22,689 --> 00:18:25,559
Well, I think he sounds peachy keen.

285
00:18:26,568 --> 00:18:29,024
Maybe, if you believe in miracles,

286
00:18:29,154 --> 00:18:31,859
Prince Charming will show up again
someday.

287
00:18:31,991 --> 00:18:33,817
Somewhere unexpected.

288
00:18:33,951 --> 00:18:36,619
See you later. Come on, girls.

289
00:18:39,081 --> 00:18:42,166
- Do you really think so, Frenchy?
- Sure.

290
00:18:43,878 --> 00:18:46,795
Erm... Sandy, I think
we oughta get to class.

291
00:19:08,278 --> 00:19:10,151
(all) Do the splits, give a yell

292
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,189
Show a little spirit for old Rydell

293
00:19:12,323 --> 00:19:14,483
Way to go, red and white

294
00:19:14,618 --> 00:19:17,074
Go Rydell, fight, fight, fight!

295
00:19:18,288 --> 00:19:21,372
(fanfare)

296
00:19:25,171 --> 00:19:26,997
And now...

297
00:19:27,631 --> 00:19:29,919
Quiet, please.

298
00:19:32,761 --> 00:19:36,925
Quiet, everyone. Now, boys and girls,
the man of the hour.

299
00:19:37,058 --> 00:19:38,885
The coach we're all depending on

300
00:19:39,018 --> 00:19:42,553
to pull Rydell out of
a seven-season slump,

301
00:19:42,688 --> 00:19:45,476
our very own Coach Calhoun.

302
00:19:45,608 --> 00:19:47,436
(cheering)

303
00:19:55,202 --> 00:19:57,871
- Who's the best?
- (all) Rydell!

304
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,575
Give 'em hell, Rydell!

305
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:09,379
I just wanna tell you students
that we have a banner year coming up.

306
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:12,628
Because my boys are primed,
really primed,

307
00:20:12,762 --> 00:20:15,632
because I primed 'em.

308
00:20:15,764 --> 00:20:19,763
Not only primed, they're honed.
Honed to a sharp razor-edge.

309
00:20:20,645 --> 00:20:22,887
We're not just going out there
to win.

310
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:27,067
We're going out there for glory.
And when we get out there,

311
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:29,731
we're gonna yank 'em and tear 'em

312
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:31,655
and rip 'em.

313
00:20:31,782 --> 00:20:36,444
We'll take 'em and roll 'em around
and rip 'em up to pieces!

314
00:20:36,579 --> 00:20:38,784
Then we're gonna slaughter 'em.

315
00:20:39,623 --> 00:20:41,865
And after the slaughter is over,

316
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,370
we're gonna come back here
and ring that victory bell.

317
00:20:48,882 --> 00:20:50,839
Like we always wanted to.

318
00:21:13,616 --> 00:21:14,779
Watch this.

319
00:21:14,909 --> 00:21:17,864
Nyik-nyak, nyik-nyak
Brrr, nyik-nyak

320
00:21:17,996 --> 00:21:20,867
Do a split, give a yell
Shake a tit for old Rydell!

321
00:21:25,171 --> 00:21:26,712
Guys.

322
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:28,297
Be cool, huh?

323
00:21:31,343 --> 00:21:33,170
Hey, watch out, pinhead!

324
00:21:37,808 --> 00:21:39,849
Well, what do you think?

325
00:21:39,978 --> 00:21:41,935
What a hunk of junk.

326
00:21:42,898 --> 00:21:45,732
Wait till I give it a paint job,
soup up the engine.

327
00:21:45,859 --> 00:21:49,108
She'll run like a champ.
I'm racing her at Thunder Road.

328
00:21:49,236 --> 00:21:52,154
- Thunder Road?
- Yeah. Wanna make something of it?

329
00:21:52,282 --> 00:21:55,697
I wanna see you
make something of this heap.

330
00:21:55,826 --> 00:21:57,866
You're cruisin' for a bruisin'.

331
00:21:57,995 --> 00:22:00,666
What are Scorpions doing here?
It ain't their turf.

332
00:22:04,378 --> 00:22:07,793
- Think they wanna rumble?
- If they do, we'll be ready.

333
00:22:15,848 --> 00:22:18,634
Alright, gang. Let's go get 'em!

334
00:22:27,443 --> 00:22:29,270
- Hey, chicken.
- Whoo-hoo!

335
00:22:29,403 --> 00:22:31,147
What you doing?

336
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,909
- Thanks, Frenchy.
- That's alright.

337
00:22:35,035 --> 00:22:39,164
- You were great out there.
- I messed up, I was so nervous.

338
00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:41,994
- Your split was divoon.
- Hi, Sandy.

339
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:45,043
- Hi, Rizz. Hi, girls.
- We got a surprise for you.

340
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,545
- What is it?
- You'll see.

341
00:22:46,672 --> 00:22:47,787
Right, Rizz?

342
00:22:47,924 --> 00:22:49,501
Let me comb your hair down.

343
00:22:49,633 --> 00:22:51,589
Where are we going?

344
00:22:51,718 --> 00:22:53,462
Want a little lipstick?

345
00:22:54,596 --> 00:22:57,847
If you fix up this car,
it could be make-out city.

346
00:22:57,975 --> 00:23:01,345
A chick is gonna have to put out
before she even gets in.

347
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:02,854
You'd better believe it.

348
00:23:02,979 --> 00:23:05,981
Hey, Zuko. I got a surprise for you.

349
00:23:06,108 --> 00:23:07,852
Oh, yeah?

350
00:23:08,528 --> 00:23:10,319
Yeah.

351
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:14,229
- Sandy!
- Danny?

352
00:23:14,367 --> 00:23:18,067
What are you doing here?
I thought you were back in Australia.

353
00:23:18,204 --> 00:23:19,782
We had a change of plan.

354
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:21,613
I can't...

355
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,504
That's cool, baby. You know how it
is. Rockin' and rollin' and whatnot.

356
00:23:28,632 --> 00:23:31,254
- Danny?
- That's my name, don't wear it out.

357
00:23:31,385 --> 00:23:34,636
- What's the matter with you?
- What's the matter with me?

358
00:23:34,764 --> 00:23:36,839
What's the matter with you?

359
00:23:38,225 --> 00:23:41,346
What happened to the Danny Zuko
I met at the beach?

360
00:23:41,478 --> 00:23:45,808
Well, I do not know.
Maybe there's two of us, right?

361
00:23:46,776 --> 00:23:50,524
Why don't you take out
a missing-persons ad or...

362
00:23:50,654 --> 00:23:52,944
...try the Yellow Pages?
I don't know.

363
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:57,911
You're a fake and a phoney.
I wish I'd never laid eyes on you.

364
00:23:58,037 --> 00:24:00,030
(all) Ooohhh...

365
00:24:00,748 --> 00:24:03,204
I wonder if she carries
silver bullets!

366
00:24:05,253 --> 00:24:08,124
So she laid her eyes on you,
huh, Zuko?

367
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,422
I bet that's not all
she's laid on him.

368
00:24:12,552 --> 00:24:16,171
- Hey, Zuke! I got a car, remember?
- Come on, Danny.

369
00:24:16,307 --> 00:24:19,807
- Who's got beer money?
- I swiped my brother's ID.

370
00:24:24,857 --> 00:24:27,527
He was so nice to me this summer.

371
00:24:27,652 --> 00:24:30,689
Listen, Sandy, men are rats.

372
00:24:32,155 --> 00:24:35,739
Listen to me.
They're fleas on rats.

373
00:24:36,327 --> 00:24:39,779
Worse than that,
they're amoebas on fleas on rats.

374
00:24:39,915 --> 00:24:43,580
I mean, they're too low
for even the dogs to bite.

375
00:24:45,295 --> 00:24:48,166
The only man a girl can depend on
is her daddy.

376
00:24:49,966 --> 00:24:53,550
You know what you need?
A night out with the girls.

377
00:24:55,097 --> 00:24:59,225
We're having a sleep-over
at my house tonight. Wanna come?

378
00:24:59,351 --> 00:25:02,352
Good. You'll love it. Come on.

379
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,768
Hey, look at Jan.

380
00:25:05,899 --> 00:25:08,817
¶ Brush-a, brush-a, brush-a
Get the new lpana

381
00:25:08,944 --> 00:25:12,029
¶ With the brand-new flavour
It's dandy for your teeth

382
00:25:12,156 --> 00:25:15,407
¶ Brush-a, brush-a, brush-a,
New lpana toothpaste

383
00:25:15,535 --> 00:25:19,662
¶ Brush-a, brush-a, brush-a
Knocks out decay germs fast

384
00:25:19,789 --> 00:25:21,948
¶ Fast, fast, you sure are right

385
00:25:22,834 --> 00:25:24,459
Turn it off.

386
00:25:25,962 --> 00:25:28,203
- Hand me a ciggie butt.
- Yeah, me, too.

387
00:25:28,339 --> 00:25:30,416
- Want one, Sandy?
- I don't smoke.

388
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:34,251
- You don't?
- Go ahead, try it. It won't kill ya.

389
00:25:39,727 --> 00:25:43,855
Oh, I forgot to say, you shouldn't
inhale unless you're used to it.

390
00:25:44,315 --> 00:25:48,230
Sandy, let me teach you how to
French inhale. It's really cool.

391
00:25:51,614 --> 00:25:55,398
God. That is
the ugliest-looking thing I ever saw.

392
00:25:56,202 --> 00:25:59,536
The guys really go for it.
It's how I got my nickname.

393
00:25:59,664 --> 00:26:01,371
Sure it is.

394
00:26:04,126 --> 00:26:07,828
OK, how about a little Sneaky Pete
to get the party goin'?

395
00:26:09,341 --> 00:26:12,176
Italian Swiss Colony?
Wow, it's imported.

396
00:26:12,302 --> 00:26:14,508
I brought Twinkies.
Anybody want one?

397
00:26:14,638 --> 00:26:17,556
Twinkies and wine?
That's real class, Jan.

398
00:26:17,683 --> 00:26:20,768
It says right here
it is a dessert wine.

399
00:26:20,895 --> 00:26:23,468
Hey, Sandy didn't get any wine.

400
00:26:23,605 --> 00:26:27,224
- Oh, that's OK.
- I bet you never had a drink before.

401
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:30,479
I had champagne
at my cousin's wedding once.

402
00:26:30,612 --> 00:26:32,024
Ring-a-ding-ding!

403
00:26:32,156 --> 00:26:34,314
What's wrong? We don't got cooties.

404
00:26:37,578 --> 00:26:41,078
Hey, Sandy. Would you like me
to pierce your ears for ya?

405
00:26:41,207 --> 00:26:44,541
- (jeering)
- Shut up!

406
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:48,378
Isn't it awfully dangerous?

407
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:51,543
I know what I'm doing.
I'm going to be a beautician.

408
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:54,381
- What's the matter? You afraid?
- No, I'm not.

409
00:26:54,513 --> 00:26:58,344
- Here, Frenchy, use my virgin pin.
- It's good for somethin'.

410
00:26:59,393 --> 00:27:01,635
- It's not a good idea.
- It's OK.

411
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:04,344
My father won't like it. (screams)

412
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,891
Sandy, let's go into the bathroom.

413
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:10,944
My mother'll kill me
if I get blood on the carpet.

414
00:27:11,072 --> 00:27:14,441
- It only bleeds for a second.
- I don't feel very well.

415
00:27:14,576 --> 00:27:16,568
Don't worry. If she screws up,

416
00:27:16,703 --> 00:27:19,739
she can fix your hair
so your ears don't show.

417
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:24,208
Sandy, Sandy, beauty is pain.

418
00:27:24,335 --> 00:27:25,830
(screams)

419
00:27:25,962 --> 00:27:28,370
Could you get some ice
to numb her ears?

420
00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:32,499
Let the cold water run
and stick her ear under the faucet.

421
00:27:39,434 --> 00:27:42,007
Personally,
I'm getting rather chilly.

422
00:27:42,145 --> 00:27:45,016
- Hey, what's that?
- From Bobby in Korea.

423
00:27:45,148 --> 00:27:48,352
- Are you going with a Korean?
- Dummy, he's a marine.

424
00:27:48,485 --> 00:27:50,858
A marine? Whooo!

425
00:27:51,322 --> 00:27:52,484
Wanna see a picture?

426
00:27:54,241 --> 00:27:56,910
God. You're turning into
a one-woman USO.

427
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,912
Hey, you guys, Sandy's sick.

428
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:04,243
I just did one ear.
She saw the blood and... bleurgh!

429
00:28:05,168 --> 00:28:07,328
You won't get your hands on my ears.

430
00:28:07,464 --> 00:28:12,126
Yeah? You'll be sorry. I have been
accepted to La Cafury Beauty School.

431
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,336
You're dropping out of Rydell?

432
00:28:14,471 --> 00:28:19,263
I don't see it as dropping out. I see
it as a very strategic career move.

433
00:28:19,393 --> 00:28:22,975
- Why's it torn in half?
- His old girlfriend was in it.

434
00:28:27,067 --> 00:28:30,483
Er... Sandy,
here's your toothbrush.

435
00:28:31,863 --> 00:28:34,900
Thanks, Frenchy.
I'm sorry to be so much trouble.

436
00:28:35,993 --> 00:28:37,819
It's OK.

437
00:28:39,288 --> 00:28:41,957
Miss Goody Two-Shoes
makes me wanna barf.

438
00:28:42,625 --> 00:28:46,458
¶ Look at me, I'm Sandra Dee

439
00:28:46,587 --> 00:28:50,288
¶ Lousy with virginity

440
00:28:50,424 --> 00:28:54,043
¶ Won't go to bed
Till I'm legally wed

441
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:57,180
¶ I can't, I'm Sandra Dee

442
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,595
Watch it.

443
00:28:59,726 --> 00:29:01,884
¶ Hey, I'm Doris Day

444
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:05,852
¶ I was not brought up that way

445
00:29:05,983 --> 00:29:09,233
¶ Won't come across
Even Rock Hudson lost

446
00:29:09,362 --> 00:29:14,403
¶ His heart to Doris Day

447
00:29:14,533 --> 00:29:16,110
- ¶ I don't drink
- No!

448
00:29:16,243 --> 00:29:17,738
- ¶ Or swear
- Oh!

449
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:19,697
- ¶ I don't rat my hair
- Yeurgh!

450
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:22,831
¶ I get ill from one cigarette
(coughs)

451
00:29:22,958 --> 00:29:27,122
¶ Keep your filthy paws
Off my silky drawers

452
00:29:27,255 --> 00:29:29,924
¶ Would you pull that crap
with Annette?

453
00:29:32,803 --> 00:29:36,385
¶ As for you, Troy Donahue

454
00:29:37,265 --> 00:29:39,591
¶ I know what you wanna do

455
00:29:40,393 --> 00:29:43,810
¶ You've got your crust
I'm no object of lust

456
00:29:43,939 --> 00:29:47,224
¶ I'm just plain Sandra Dee

457
00:29:48,652 --> 00:29:50,609
¶ Elvis! Elvis!

458
00:29:50,738 --> 00:29:52,777
¶ Let me be

459
00:29:52,907 --> 00:29:55,693
¶ Keep that pelvis far from me

460
00:29:55,825 --> 00:30:00,571
¶ Just keep your cool
Now you're starting to drool

461
00:30:01,415 --> 00:30:03,740
¶ Hey, fongool

462
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:06,412
¶ I'm Sandra Dee

463
00:30:12,718 --> 00:30:14,094
Making fun of me, Rizz?

464
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:18,798
Some people are so touchy.

465
00:30:29,402 --> 00:30:32,902
- ¶ Later on they start to scratch...
- Shut up, you vultures.

466
00:30:33,032 --> 00:30:34,691
I changed my mind. Let's go.

467
00:30:34,825 --> 00:30:37,114
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

468
00:30:37,244 --> 00:30:38,870
(squealing)

469
00:30:39,913 --> 00:30:44,291
- They can't come. My folks'll flip.
- Putzie, you call her.

470
00:30:44,418 --> 00:30:47,622
Oh, Sandy.
Wherefore art thou, Sandy?

471
00:30:47,756 --> 00:30:49,333
Shut up! Sit down.

472
00:30:51,091 --> 00:30:53,131
You goody-goodies are too much.

473
00:30:53,261 --> 00:30:57,424
I'm gonna get my kicks while
I'm still young enough to get 'em.

474
00:30:57,557 --> 00:30:59,882
Is she gonna
shinny down the drainpipe?

475
00:31:00,018 --> 00:31:02,058
Hey, look. There's Rizzo.

476
00:31:02,187 --> 00:31:04,594
You're doing that without a net.

477
00:31:12,573 --> 00:31:14,611
Swell bunch, rushing to help a lady.

478
00:31:14,741 --> 00:31:17,447
- Lady? I don't see a lady.
- Shut up. Shut up!

479
00:31:17,577 --> 00:31:20,744
- What's up, Kenick?
- One guess.

480
00:31:20,873 --> 00:31:24,621
- You got a lot to offer a girl.
- Yeah, you know it.

481
00:31:25,502 --> 00:31:29,749
- What say you, Zuke?
- You're lookin' good, Rizz.

482
00:31:30,508 --> 00:31:33,628
- Eat your heart out.
- Sloppy seconds ain't my style.

483
00:31:40,143 --> 00:31:41,886
You going to flog your log?

484
00:31:44,064 --> 00:31:47,598
It's better than hanging around
with you dorks.

485
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:50,897
Your chariot, my lady.

486
00:32:02,624 --> 00:32:04,867
I don't know what I saw
in Danny Zuko.

487
00:32:05,002 --> 00:32:07,576
Don't sweat it, honey.
Have one of mine.

488
00:32:09,381 --> 00:32:11,539
- There's so many of them.
- I know.

489
00:32:11,675 --> 00:32:14,795
- How do you keep up with them?
- I'm a terrific pen pal.

490
00:32:14,929 --> 00:32:17,135
Hopelessly devoted to every one.

491
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:27,315
What are you doing?

492
00:32:27,442 --> 00:32:30,360
OK. What do you think this is?
A gangbang?

493
00:32:30,487 --> 00:32:32,360
- You wish.
- (all laugh)

494
00:32:33,072 --> 00:32:34,650
Hit the pavement.

495
00:32:34,782 --> 00:32:36,194
You gotta be kidding.

496
00:32:36,326 --> 00:32:38,402
- I said now.
- Alright.

497
00:32:38,537 --> 00:32:40,281
Remember us in your will.

498
00:32:46,003 --> 00:32:49,917
When a guy picks a chick
over his buddies, something's wrong.

499
00:32:50,591 --> 00:32:53,261
Come on, guys,
let's go for a slice of pizza.

500
00:32:55,387 --> 00:32:57,630
Can I have some of that?

501
00:32:57,765 --> 00:32:59,841
Sure.

502
00:32:59,976 --> 00:33:02,134
- Thanks.
- Wait.

503
00:33:09,027 --> 00:33:10,402
(door closes)

504
00:33:22,165 --> 00:33:28,084
¶ Guess mine is not
the first heart broken

505
00:33:28,755 --> 00:33:34,130
¶ My eyes are not the first
to cry

506
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:38,509
¶ I'm not the first to know

507
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:43,517
¶ There's just no getting over you

508
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:54,155
¶ You know,
I'm just a fool who's willing

509
00:33:55,033 --> 00:34:00,194
¶ To sit around and wait for you

510
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:04,167
¶ But, baby, can't you see?

511
00:34:04,835 --> 00:34:09,580
¶ There's nothing else for me to do

512
00:34:11,175 --> 00:34:16,465
¶ I'm hopelessly devoted to you

513
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:23,890
¶ But now there's nowhere to hide

514
00:34:24,022 --> 00:34:27,224
¶ Since you pushed my love aside

515
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:30,774
¶ I'm out of my head

516
00:34:30,904 --> 00:34:36,657
¶ Hopelessly devoted to you

517
00:34:37,452 --> 00:34:43,573
¶ Hopelessly devoted to you

518
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:53,044
¶ Hopelessly devoted to you

519
00:34:56,846 --> 00:34:59,136
¶ My head is saying

520
00:34:59,267 --> 00:35:03,311
¶ Fool, forget him

521
00:35:03,437 --> 00:35:05,478
¶ My heart is saying

522
00:35:05,606 --> 00:35:09,022
¶ Don't let go

523
00:35:10,069 --> 00:35:13,521
¶ Hold on to the end

524
00:35:13,657 --> 00:35:17,986
¶ And that's what I intend to do

525
00:35:19,704 --> 00:35:25,494
¶ I'm hopelessly devoted to you

526
00:35:27,212 --> 00:35:32,288
¶ But now there's nowhere to hide

527
00:35:32,425 --> 00:35:35,629
¶ Since you pushed my love aside

528
00:35:35,762 --> 00:35:39,464
¶ I'm out of my head

529
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:45,104
¶ Hopelessly devoted to you

530
00:35:45,982 --> 00:35:51,772
¶ Hopelessly devoted to you

531
00:35:55,700 --> 00:36:02,414
¶ Hopelessly devoted to you

532
00:36:11,425 --> 00:36:13,465
(radio) Is acne ruining your life?

533
00:36:13,595 --> 00:36:17,128
Do you close your eyes when you
look in the mirror? Fear no more.

534
00:36:17,264 --> 00:36:21,512
Face up to Face-Off, for deep
penetration into infected pores.

535
00:36:21,644 --> 00:36:24,681
Help dry up unsightly pimples
and blemishes...

536
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,849
(grunts)

537
00:36:40,288 --> 00:36:43,704
- Rizz. Rizz.
- Could you call me by my first name?

538
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:45,708
Oh, erm...

539
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:46,950
Betty.

540
00:36:47,087 --> 00:36:48,711
Betty. Betty.

541
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:59,180
- Have you got something?
- Are you kidding?

542
00:37:06,816 --> 00:37:08,856
My 25-cent insurance policy.

543
00:37:08,985 --> 00:37:10,811
Big spender.

544
00:37:14,407 --> 00:37:16,649
- What?
- It broke.

545
00:37:16,784 --> 00:37:18,943
How could it break?

546
00:37:19,496 --> 00:37:21,868
I bought it
when I was in seventh grade.

547
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,085
Ohhh...

548
00:37:38,891 --> 00:37:40,800
What the hell?

549
00:37:45,147 --> 00:37:46,890
(crash)

550
00:37:48,401 --> 00:37:51,983
- What the hell are you doin'?
- It's a no-parking zone, creep.

551
00:37:53,281 --> 00:37:56,198
The whole place is a no-parking zone,
crater-face.

552
00:37:56,325 --> 00:37:58,365
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

553
00:38:01,122 --> 00:38:02,581
(crash)

554
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:04,702
You're gonna pay for that.

555
00:38:05,294 --> 00:38:08,959
I'll give you 75 cents for
the whole car, including your chick.

556
00:38:19,391 --> 00:38:21,467
We just have to bang out the dent.

557
00:38:21,601 --> 00:38:25,386
The problem's not in the dent,
it's this rubber-band engine.

558
00:38:25,523 --> 00:38:29,223
- The problem's your mouth.
- Where you gonna get a carburettor?

559
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:33,737
- Ever heard of borrowing?
- Kenickie, you got any Scotch tape?

560
00:38:33,864 --> 00:38:36,652
Hey, big stuff.
What do you drive, huh?

561
00:38:36,784 --> 00:38:38,943
- I drive.
- Yeah? How about you?

562
00:38:39,078 --> 00:38:40,703
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

563
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:42,656
What about Doody?

564
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:45,412
- Well, I...
- That's what I thought.

565
00:38:45,543 --> 00:38:51,415
C'mon, guys. This car could be
a major piece of machinery. Look.

566
00:38:52,801 --> 00:38:55,090
This car could be systematic.

567
00:38:56,596 --> 00:38:58,424
Hydromatic.

568
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,724
Ultramatic.

569
00:39:02,228 --> 00:39:05,431
It could be Greased Lightning.

570
00:39:05,563 --> 00:39:09,396
¶ You get some overhead lifters
and four-barrel quads, oh, yeah

571
00:39:09,527 --> 00:39:11,815
¶ Keep talking, whoa, keep talking

572
00:39:11,946 --> 00:39:14,982
¶ With fuel-injection cut-off
and chrome-plated rods, oh, yeah

573
00:39:15,115 --> 00:39:17,689
¶ We'll get her ready
We'll get her ready

574
00:39:17,826 --> 00:39:20,828
¶ With a four-speed on the floor
They'll be waiting at the door

575
00:39:20,955 --> 00:39:23,577
¶ You know that ain't no shit
We'll be getting lots of tit

576
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:25,535
- ¶ In Greased Lightning
- ¶ Go, go, go

577
00:39:25,668 --> 00:39:26,996

586
00:39:50,777 --> 00:39:54,610
¶ A palomino dashboard
and dual-muffler twins, oh, yeah

587
00:39:56,659 --> 00:39:59,778

Come on, guys. Let's get to work.

603
00:42:08,213 --> 00:42:09,755
(yelling)

604
00:42:25,146 --> 00:42:28,064
Those Scorpions,
they're asking for it.

605
00:42:29,276 --> 00:42:32,728
Danny, what's up?
You still thinking about that chick?

606
00:42:32,863 --> 00:42:35,947
- You nuts?
- No, I was just thinking.

607
00:42:36,074 --> 00:42:38,648
- Don't think so much.
- That's cool.

608
00:42:42,122 --> 00:42:44,032
Hey, guys.

609
00:42:44,167 --> 00:42:47,950
- Kenickie, Zuko.
- How's it hangin'?

610
00:42:48,086 --> 00:42:50,080
OK, the meeting is in session.

611
00:42:53,009 --> 00:42:57,088
Know what I heard? Last year the fuzz
had Thunder Road staked out.

612
00:42:57,221 --> 00:43:01,516
- Everyone got hauled to the clink.
- No one'll catch Greased Lightning.

613
00:43:01,643 --> 00:43:03,932
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

614
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:08,312
- Somebody snaking you, Danny?
- Bite the weenie, Rizz.

615
00:43:08,441 --> 00:43:10,351
With relish.

616
00:43:14,781 --> 00:43:18,696
- I don't know about these chicks.
- They're only good for one thing.

617
00:43:19,369 --> 00:43:23,449
What do you do with 'em
the other 23 hours 45 minutes a day?

618
00:43:24,375 --> 00:43:26,035
Does it only take 15 minutes?

619
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:31,126
Want some new music?

620
00:43:31,257 --> 00:43:33,926
- Yeah.
- I'll need some money.

621
00:43:36,888 --> 00:43:38,797
Thanks.

622
00:43:42,101 --> 00:43:43,928
(wolf whistles)

623
00:43:45,021 --> 00:43:46,848
I'll be right back.

624
00:43:52,321 --> 00:43:54,147
Hi, Danny!

625
00:43:55,157 --> 00:43:57,826
- I can't talk.
- What are you doing later?

626
00:43:57,952 --> 00:44:00,525
- I can't talk, alright?
- Call me.

627
00:44:11,298 --> 00:44:13,458
- Hi, Sandy.
- Oh, hi.

628
00:44:13,593 --> 00:44:15,834
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.

629
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:17,428
That's good.

630
00:44:17,555 --> 00:44:21,055
Sandy, I've been wanting
to talk to you for a long time.

631
00:44:21,184 --> 00:44:24,185
- What about?
- About the night at the bonfire.

632
00:44:24,313 --> 00:44:26,684
The way I acted, that was terrible.

633
00:44:26,814 --> 00:44:30,018
It wasn't me, you gotta know that.

634
00:44:30,151 --> 00:44:32,725
It was me, of course,
but it wasn't me.

635
00:44:34,322 --> 00:44:37,111
You see, Sandy,
I got this image, right? And...

636
00:44:37,242 --> 00:44:40,658
That's why I'm so glad
that Tom's such a simple person.

637
00:44:45,376 --> 00:44:48,580
Simple's right.
Too bad his brains are in his biceps.

638
00:44:49,671 --> 00:44:51,296
Jealous, are you?

639
00:44:52,382 --> 00:44:55,882
Jealous? Oh, come on, Sandy,
don't make me laugh.

640
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:59,220
What have you ever done?

641
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:05,681
Come on! I can run circles
around those jerks.

642
00:45:05,814 --> 00:45:07,972
I'll believe that when I see it.

643
00:45:32,008 --> 00:45:36,337
Let's start with the first rule. Cut
it down to two packs a day. There.

644
00:45:40,224 --> 00:45:43,594
What sort of athletics
are you interested in?

645
00:45:43,728 --> 00:45:44,807
You like the rings?

646
00:45:44,938 --> 00:45:49,149
Yeah, I installed a set
just a couple of weeks ago.

647
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:54,189
The first thing we have to do
is you have to change.

648
00:45:54,322 --> 00:45:56,445
That's why I'm here, to change.

649
00:45:56,575 --> 00:45:59,909
- No, I mean your clothes.
- Oh.

650
00:46:06,627 --> 00:46:08,666
Alright. Let's knock it off.

651
00:46:08,796 --> 00:46:14,502
Fellas, I wanna introduce a new man.
Danny. Let's give him a tryout.

652
00:46:16,846 --> 00:46:20,760
- Better watch it.
- Come on. A little fire, here we go.

653
00:46:34,447 --> 00:46:36,405
You have to dribble.

654
00:46:39,954 --> 00:46:42,029
- Here you go, Coach.
- Thanks, son.

655
00:46:42,163 --> 00:46:44,535
Dribble the ball,
put it in the basket.

656
00:46:44,666 --> 00:46:47,667
- Think you can do that?
- Can I do that!

657
00:46:47,794 --> 00:46:50,831
- OK.
- Danny, over here. Danny!

658
00:46:50,965 --> 00:46:52,507
Let's go.

659
00:46:54,927 --> 00:46:56,836
That's it. Go, go, go.

660
00:46:57,596 --> 00:46:59,257
Get him, Danny.

661
00:47:03,769 --> 00:47:05,477
- (whistle)
- What'd I do?

662
00:47:05,604 --> 00:47:08,356
- Is he kidding?
- Boy, oh, boy.

663
00:47:11,402 --> 00:47:16,314
I want you to meet
your wrestling partner. Danny, Andy.

664
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:19,903
Are you crazy?

665
00:47:20,037 --> 00:47:23,240
Come on, come on.
Let's start. Get in first position.

666
00:47:23,373 --> 00:47:25,615
Danny, you get down.

667
00:47:25,751 --> 00:47:28,123
OK, Andy, get down. Ready?

668
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:32,505
(whistle)

669
00:47:33,676 --> 00:47:35,218
Hold it, hold it.

670
00:47:36,095 --> 00:47:38,965
Danny, you gotta try. Come on.

671
00:47:40,475 --> 00:47:44,175
Alright, Andy, let's change
positions. You get down. Come on.

672
00:47:49,317 --> 00:47:51,191
Alright. Ready?

673
00:47:51,319 --> 00:47:53,027
(whistle)

674
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:55,982
- Give?
- Yeah, give.

675
00:47:56,116 --> 00:47:57,445
Good.

676
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:03,577
He's a hitter.

677
00:48:07,378 --> 00:48:11,209
You'll like baseball. It's not
that much of a contact sport.

678
00:48:11,339 --> 00:48:13,795
Get in there and let's see
what you can do.

679
00:48:13,925 --> 00:48:15,883
Throw the ball. Let's play.

680
00:48:17,429 --> 00:48:19,174
Let's pitch this guy out.

681
00:48:19,306 --> 00:48:22,058
- He can't hit.
- This boy can't even bat.

682
00:48:22,184 --> 00:48:25,186
- Strike.
- I told you. He doesn't even swing.

683
00:48:25,312 --> 00:48:28,018
What kind of ball player are you?
Put it in here.

684
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:32,353
Strike.

685
00:48:33,738 --> 00:48:37,403
Come on. A little fire in there.
Let's see you hit it.

686
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,406
Foul ball.

687
00:48:46,167 --> 00:48:48,410
- Easy, easy.
- Now! Come on.

688
00:48:48,545 --> 00:48:50,704
Put the bat down. Put the bat down.

689
00:48:52,424 --> 00:48:55,923
There's a lot of other sports
that don't have any contact.

690
00:48:56,052 --> 00:48:58,758
- Yeah, like what?
- Like track.

691
00:48:58,889 --> 00:49:02,389
- What do you mean, running?
- Just like running?

692
00:49:03,353 --> 00:49:05,724
I mean something
that needs endurance.

693
00:49:05,855 --> 00:49:10,647
Something that needs stamina.
Like, long-distance running.

694
00:49:10,776 --> 00:49:13,018
Cross-country running.

695
00:49:15,365 --> 00:49:17,606
- That could be cool.
- Good.

696
00:49:44,562 --> 00:49:45,807
Danny.

697
00:49:49,776 --> 00:49:52,017
Danny, are you alright?

698
00:49:54,154 --> 00:49:55,982
Danny, talk to me.

699
00:49:57,033 --> 00:50:00,568
The least you can do is talk to me
after the way you treated me.

700
00:50:00,704 --> 00:50:03,490
The way I...?
Sandy, I told you I was sorry.

701
00:50:03,623 --> 00:50:05,367
Got you talking.

702
00:50:06,876 --> 00:50:09,546
- You sure you're OK?
- Yes, I'm fine.

703
00:50:11,132 --> 00:50:14,132
- So, still dating that jockstrap?
- Well...

704
00:50:15,427 --> 00:50:19,342
- Is he taking you to the dance?
- Well, that all depends.

705
00:50:19,473 --> 00:50:21,015
- On what?
- On you.

706
00:50:21,141 --> 00:50:23,099
- On me?
- Yeah.

707
00:50:23,436 --> 00:50:24,929
He can stag it.

708
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:32,403
Come on.

709
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:34,023
(horn)

710
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:37,070
(music plays in background)

711
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:47,497
- Sandy, let's go someplace else.
- Why?

712
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:51,669
We can't be alone here, that's why.

713
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,376
Danny.

714
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:56,677
OK.

715
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:06,602
You nearly pulled my arm out.

716
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:09,815
I didn't want to miss this table.
It's the best one.

717
00:51:10,902 --> 00:51:13,986
- What are you doing?
- I just want privacy.

718
00:51:14,113 --> 00:51:17,529
- What'll it be, kids?
- Cherry soda, please.

719
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:19,616
- Danny?
- I'm not very hungry.

720
00:51:19,744 --> 00:51:24,121
Give me a double polar burger with
everything and a soda with ice cream.

721
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:26,288
Sounds good. I'll have the same.

722
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:28,577
The same? You can eat a lot.

723
00:51:28,712 --> 00:51:31,084
- You're funny.
- No, you are.

724
00:51:31,214 --> 00:51:35,461
- How ya doing, Zuke? Nice!
- Hiya, Rizzo. How are you?

725
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:37,752
Peachy keen, jelly bean.

726
00:51:38,221 --> 00:51:41,425
You got any quarters?
We could split an Eskimo Pie.

727
00:51:41,559 --> 00:51:45,805
- My Dutch treat days are over.
- You plan on staying home a lot.

728
00:51:45,938 --> 00:51:49,556
Greetings, pals and gals.
Anybody got 23 cents?

729
00:51:49,691 --> 00:51:52,148
Wanna chip in for a Dog-Sled Delight?

730
00:51:52,279 --> 00:51:56,525
I don't know where my money goes.
A dime here, 15 cents there.

731
00:51:56,657 --> 00:51:59,777
In a couple of months
Frenchy can take us all out.

732
00:51:59,911 --> 00:52:01,654
A working girl with income.

733
00:52:01,788 --> 00:52:04,871
Y'know, they don't pay
that much to start with.

734
00:52:04,999 --> 00:52:09,044
It's more than we make. Ante up,
I don't get my allowance till Friday.

735
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:11,662
- You get an allowance?
- When I'm a good boy.

736
00:52:11,798 --> 00:52:14,372
Viola, a Dog-Sled Delight
with four spoons.

737
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:17,379
- And an Eskimo Pie with a knife.
- Hi, gang.

738
00:52:19,305 --> 00:52:21,465
Here you are. Grab it and growl.

739
00:52:25,562 --> 00:52:27,888
I got so many hickeys
I look like a leper.

740
00:52:28,023 --> 00:52:32,068
Cheer up. A hickey from Kenickie
is like a Hallmark card.

741
00:52:32,194 --> 00:52:34,436
You care enough
to send the very best.

742
00:52:36,074 --> 00:52:39,359
- You pig.
- I love it when you talk dirty.

743
00:52:40,786 --> 00:52:44,701
My parents want to invite you
to tea on Sunday. Will you come?

744
00:52:45,875 --> 00:52:49,078
- I don't like tea.
- You don't have to drink tea.

745
00:52:49,962 --> 00:52:52,002
Well, I don't like parents.

746
00:52:54,426 --> 00:52:56,798
- Want some?
- Erm, uh-uh.

747
00:52:56,929 --> 00:52:58,886
You sure are a cheap date.

748
00:52:59,014 --> 00:53:02,050
- I didn't mean it like that.
- I understand.

749
00:53:02,183 --> 00:53:05,683
- I always found you understanding.
- I am.

750
00:53:05,813 --> 00:53:09,727
I also think
there's more to you than just fat.

751
00:53:09,858 --> 00:53:12,562
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

752
00:53:12,694 --> 00:53:14,734
- Got a date for the dance-off?
- No.

753
00:53:14,864 --> 00:53:16,061
- Wanna go?
- Yeah.

754
00:53:16,198 --> 00:53:20,908
I'll be a senior forever if
I don't study for that algebra test.

755
00:53:21,037 --> 00:53:23,907
You're in luck.
You got an armed escort home.

756
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:28,203
It's not the arms I'm worried about,
Sonny. It's the hands.

757
00:53:28,336 --> 00:53:30,328
She loves me.

758
00:53:32,382 --> 00:53:34,670
- You coming, French?
- I don't think so.

759
00:53:34,801 --> 00:53:37,885
- I think I'll hang out a bit longer.
- Alright.

760
00:53:38,013 --> 00:53:42,889
I have been dieting all day long. My
mom's apple pie's better than this.

761
00:53:43,018 --> 00:53:45,259
- Do you want a piece?
- Yeah, sure.

762
00:53:46,354 --> 00:53:47,683
- Putzie.
- Yeah?

763
00:53:47,815 --> 00:53:49,439
15 minutes!

764
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:55,189
I'm worried about this dance-off. Do
they dance differently to back home?

765
00:53:55,323 --> 00:53:58,941
Don't worry.
Maybe we'll invent the Kangaroo Bop.

766
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:02,909
Let's get out of here, Sandy.

767
00:54:03,038 --> 00:54:04,581
See you later.

768
00:54:05,333 --> 00:54:07,491
- Bye, Frenchy.
- See ya, Sandy.

769
00:54:10,046 --> 00:54:13,332
Great. I'm stuck with the check.
Give me money.

770
00:54:14,301 --> 00:54:18,250
OK, what's with you tonight?
You got the personality of a wet mop.

771
00:54:18,387 --> 00:54:22,468
- Don't start with me.
- Fine. How about I finish with ya?

772
00:54:23,268 --> 00:54:25,261
Finish this!

773
00:54:26,314 --> 00:54:27,855
To you from me, Pinky Lee.

774
00:54:30,692 --> 00:54:32,601
Sorry, French.

775
00:54:37,366 --> 00:54:40,036
(distant) Hey, Rizzo.
I want to talk to you!

776
00:54:42,871 --> 00:54:45,030
No use crying over spilt milk shake.

777
00:54:45,165 --> 00:54:46,910
Oh, I'll be OK.

778
00:54:48,628 --> 00:54:50,667
You know it's near closing time?

779
00:54:50,797 --> 00:54:52,873
Do you mind if I stay a bit longer?

780
00:54:53,007 --> 00:54:55,000
No, suit yourself.

781
00:54:55,134 --> 00:54:57,590
- Wow.
- What?

782
00:54:57,721 --> 00:55:01,090
I hate to tell you, but your
hair looks like an Easter egg.

783
00:55:01,976 --> 00:55:03,801
Oh, yeah.

784
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:07,269
Well, I had a little trouble
in tinting class.

785
00:55:07,397 --> 00:55:10,684
In fact, I had a little trouble
in all my classes.

786
00:55:10,818 --> 00:55:14,150
Beauty school sure wasn't
what I thought it'd be.

787
00:55:14,279 --> 00:55:15,857
Nothing ever is.

788
00:55:19,702 --> 00:55:26,320
Vi? Erm... I dropped out.
What do you think of waitressing?

789
00:55:26,458 --> 00:55:28,416
You're too young to know.

790
00:55:29,295 --> 00:55:31,964
Maybe I could be
a telephone operator.

791
00:55:33,133 --> 00:55:36,964
No, I don't think I'd like to wear
those little things over my ears.

792
00:55:37,428 --> 00:55:42,803
God, if only I could have a guardian
angel to tell me what to do.

793
00:55:42,935 --> 00:55:46,552
Like Debbie Reynolds had in Tammy.
What do you think?

794
00:55:47,647 --> 00:55:50,316
If you find him,
give him my phone number.

795

and flunked shampoo

805
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:10,815
¶ Well, at least
you could have taken time

806
00:57:10,942 --> 00:57:14,063
¶ To wash and clean your clothes up

807
00:57:14,196 --> 00:57:16,604
¶ After spending all that dough

808
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:19,776
¶ To have the doctor fix your nose up

809
00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:21,867

00:57:23,247 --> 00:57:26,451
¶ Why keep your feeble hopes alive?

811
00:57:26,584 --> 00:57:29,585
- ¶ What are you provin'?

812

teach you anything

822

¶ You think you're such a looker

823
00:58:08,419 --> 00:58:11,456
¶ But no customer would go to you

824
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:14,210
¶ Unless she was a hooker

825
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:22,300

- Give him a break.
- Oh, I will!

849
01:00:01,953 --> 01:00:04,526
No, we'll work on the brakes later.

Feelin' good, too, huh?

866

Like a beautiful blonde pineapple.

874
01:02:32,026 --> 01:02:34,600
You're late, fellas. Where you been?

875
01:02:34,738 --> 01:02:38,153
- The gym never looked so good.
- You bring the provisions?

876
01:02:38,282 --> 01:02:40,525
Alright, kids. I want a big circle.

877

894
01:04:30,567 --> 01:04:32,440
- Yeah?
- Don't worry?

895
01:04:32,568 --> 01:04:34,394
Good. Come on, let's go.

01:04:44,872 --> 01:04:48,573
¶ I have never heard
that song before

899
01:04:48,709 --> 01:04:52,245
¶ But if I don't hear it any more...

900
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:54,539
Why not let me lead for a change?

901
01:04:54,674 --> 01:04:56,714
I can't help it. I'm used to leadin'.

902
01:04:56,843 --> 01:04:58,385
OK.

903
01:05:00,722 --> 01:05:04,138
Doody, can't you
turn me around or something?

904
01:05:04,268 --> 01:05:06,723
Don't talk, Frenchy.
I'm trying to count.

905
01:05:07,604 --> 01:05:09,644
¶ A melody

906
01:05:09,773 --> 01:05:11,434
¶ That's never the same

907
01:05:11,567 --> 01:05:14,355
¶ A melody
that's calling your name...

908
01:05:14,487 --> 01:05:17,487

Who is she?

914
01:05:28,835 --> 01:05:33,046
They call me Cha Cha, cos I'm
the best dancer at St Bernadette's.

915
01:05:33,172 --> 01:05:36,339
With the worst reputation.

916
01:05:36,468 --> 01:05:38,461

917
01:05:38,596 --> 01:05:42,592

Do your folks know
I come into your room every night?

921
01:05:57,531 --> 01:05:59,690
Over KZAZ, that is.

922
01:06:02,661 --> 01:06:04,904
I'm judging the dance contest.

923
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:06,747
I don't think I'm entered.

924
01:06:06,874 --> 01:06:09,829
A knockout like you?
What's your name?

925
01:06:09,961 --> 01:06:12,286
- Marty.
- Marty what?

926
01:06:12,422 --> 01:06:15,838
Maraschino. You know, like in cherry.

927
01:06:39,575 --> 01:06:42,245
- What are you doing?
- Washing my hands.

928
01:06:43,538 --> 01:06:46,657
¶ You don't remember me

929
01:06:46,791 --> 01:06:49,247
¶ But I remember you

930
01:06:49,377 --> 01:06:52,164
¶ It was not so long ago

931
01:06:52,297 --> 01:06:54,289
¶ You broke my heart in two

932
01:06:54,424 --> 01:06:57,094
¶ Tears on my pillow

933
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:59,628
¶ Pain in my heart

934
01:06:59,762 --> 01:07:03,096
¶ Caused by you,
you, you, you, you...

935
01:07:03,225 --> 01:07:05,182
How do you know her?

936
01:07:05,310 --> 01:07:08,727
Erm, she's an old friend
of the family, that's all.

937
01:07:09,564 --> 01:07:12,055
¶ Love is not a toy

938
01:07:12,192 --> 01:07:14,897
¶ When you find the one you love...

939
01:07:15,029 --> 01:07:17,816
- Aren't you glad to be back?
- Oh, yeah.

940
01:07:17,949 --> 01:07:20,617
Besides, blondes do have more fun.

941
01:07:21,577 --> 01:07:24,282
¶ If we could start anew

942
01:07:24,413 --> 01:07:26,453
¶ I wouldn't hesitate...

943
01:07:28,793 --> 01:07:31,877
When I hear music,
I can't make my feet behave.

944
01:07:32,004 --> 01:07:34,791
- Thinks she's Tinker Bell.
- Hush, Sonny.

945
01:07:35,425 --> 01:07:37,832
¶ Pain in my heart

946
01:07:37,969 --> 01:07:39,927
¶ Caused by you

947
01:07:40,555 --> 01:07:42,713
¶ You-ou-ou-ou

948
01:07:44,851 --> 01:07:47,425
Sshh.

949
01:07:47,562 --> 01:07:49,804
The Rydell fight song!

950
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:15,878
When you are finished...

951
01:08:16,967 --> 01:08:21,547
You will be happy to know that
I am not judging the dance contest.

952
01:08:26,771 --> 01:08:29,343
I think we all owe
a round of applause

953
01:08:29,481 --> 01:08:33,100
to Patty Simcox and Eugene Felznik
and committee

954
01:08:33,235 --> 01:08:35,561
for their beautiful decorations.

955
01:08:35,696 --> 01:08:37,819
Let's hear it for the toilet paper.

956
01:08:41,577 --> 01:08:46,738
In a few moments, the entire nation
will be watching Rydell High,

957
01:08:46,874 --> 01:08:51,121
God help us, and I want you all
to be on your best behaviour.

958
01:08:51,254 --> 01:08:53,246
No heinie-biting.

959
01:08:55,007 --> 01:08:56,668
And now, here he is,

960
01:08:56,802 --> 01:08:58,628
the Prince of the Platters,

961
01:08:58,762 --> 01:09:01,216
Mr Vince Fontaine.

962
01:09:07,854 --> 01:09:10,524
Mr Vince Fontaine?

963
01:09:23,078 --> 01:09:24,905
(drum rolls)

964
01:09:34,673 --> 01:09:38,257
Hey, it's great being here
at Rydell High.

965
01:09:40,305 --> 01:09:42,428
What's your name, sweetheart?

966
01:09:45,392 --> 01:09:47,848
And now, for the rules.

967
01:09:50,899 --> 01:09:54,767
Game rule one.
All couples must be boy-girl.

968
01:09:54,903 --> 01:09:57,025
Too bad, Eugene.

969
01:09:59,574 --> 01:10:01,733
Alright, alright. Come on.

970
01:10:01,869 --> 01:10:04,740
Game rule two.
During the dance contest,

971
01:10:04,872 --> 01:10:10,293
if you're tapped on the shoulder,
leave the floor, or else. I mean it.

972
01:10:10,419 --> 01:10:13,456
And rule three,
anyone doing tasteless

973
01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:16,924
or vulgar movements
will be disqualified.

974
01:10:17,052 --> 01:10:18,960
That leaves us out.

975
01:10:22,724 --> 01:10:25,180
Keep it clean, please. Keep it clean.

976
01:10:25,310 --> 01:10:27,599
20 seconds.

977
01:10:27,729 --> 01:10:31,180
Thank you, fans and friends.
Now a few words to the wise.

978
01:10:31,316 --> 01:10:32,976
You are my best pals.

979
01:10:33,109 --> 01:10:37,024
To look your best for the contest,
just have a ball, that's all.

980
01:10:37,156 --> 01:10:39,398
Forget the camera, keep on the beat,

981
01:10:39,533 --> 01:10:42,984
give the folks at home a treat.
Keep dancin', that's showbiz.

982
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:45,872
If I tap you, step aside.
Let the others ride.

983
01:10:46,499 --> 01:10:48,824
Ten seconds. Nine, eight,

984
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:52,542
seven, six, five, four,

985
01:10:52,672 --> 01:10:56,040
three, two, one. On the air.

986
01:10:56,717 --> 01:11:00,418
Welcome to National Bandstand,
live from Rydell High School.

987
01:11:00,555 --> 01:11:03,343
This is what you're waiting for,
the dance-off.

988
01:11:03,474 --> 01:11:06,891
Away we go with
Johnny Casino and the Gamblers.

989
01:11:08,605 --> 01:11:11,178
¶ You ain't nothin' but a hound dog

990
01:11:11,316 --> 01:11:13,356
¶ Cryin' all the time

991
01:11:13,485 --> 01:11:15,561
¶ You ain't nothin' but a hound dog

992
01:11:16,321 --> 01:11:18,397
¶ Cryin' all the time

993
01:11:18,615 --> 01:11:22,529
¶ You ain't never caught a rabbit
and you ain't no friend of mine

994
01:11:22,661 --> 01:11:24,619
Look. There's the camera!

995
01:11:33,506 --> 01:11:35,463
That's Putzie and Jan.

996
01:11:48,229 --> 01:11:51,812
¶ Said you was high class,
that was just a lie

997
01:11:53,234 --> 01:11:57,185
¶ Call yourself high class,
that was just a lie

998
01:11:58,031 --> 01:12:00,605
¶ Well, you ain't never
caught a rabbit...

999
01:12:00,742 --> 01:12:03,364
Oh, there's Danny and Sandy.

1000
01:12:03,495 --> 01:12:05,535
¶ You ain't nothin' but a hound dog

1001
01:12:05,664 --> 01:12:07,123
¶ Cryin' all the time

1002
01:12:10,627 --> 01:12:12,703
¶ Cryin' all the time

1003
01:12:12,837 --> 01:12:16,539
¶ You ain't never caught a rabbit
and you ain't no friend of mine

1004
01:12:19,929 --> 01:12:21,968
(song ends)

1005
01:12:22,097 --> 01:12:25,763
Now the event you've all been
waiting for, the national dance-off.

1006
01:12:25,893 --> 01:12:28,848
Some guy and gal will get
some fantabulous prizes.

1007
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:32,480
Don't feel bad if I tap you out.
It don't matter if you win or lose,

1008
01:12:32,609 --> 01:12:35,360
it's what you do
with your dancin' shoes.

1009
01:12:35,487 --> 01:12:37,978
Does everybody here know Marty?

1010
01:12:40,158 --> 01:12:43,610
OK, cats, throw your mittens
round your kittens. Away we go!

1011
01:12:47,875 --> 01:12:50,117
That wasn't supposed to happen!

1012
01:12:50,252 --> 01:12:52,743
Let's go, let's hand-jive!

1013
01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:57,126
¶ Before I was born late one night

1014
01:12:58,093 --> 01:13:00,549
¶ My papa said everything's alright

1015
01:13:01,848 --> 01:13:03,674
¶ The doctor made my ma lay down...

1016
01:13:03,808 --> 01:13:06,180
Guy with the girl in red,
throw 'em out.

1017
01:13:09,146 --> 01:13:11,436
¶ Cos the bebop stork
was about to arrive

1018
01:13:11,566 --> 01:13:13,689
¶ Mama gave birth to the hand-jive

1019
01:13:14,986 --> 01:13:17,229
¶ I could barely walk
when I milked a cow

1020
01:13:18,739 --> 01:13:21,195
¶ When I was three I pushed a plough

1021
01:13:22,285 --> 01:13:24,955
¶ While choppin' wood
I'd move my legs

1022
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:29,124
¶ And I started dancin'
while I gathered eggs

1023
01:13:30,084 --> 01:13:32,042
¶ Townsfolk clapped, I was only five

1024
01:13:32,171 --> 01:13:34,744
¶ I'd outdance 'em all,
I was born to hand-jive

1025
01:13:35,757 --> 01:13:38,593
Yes, split 'em, buddy.

1026
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:41,341
Go, go, go, go.

1027
01:13:41,472 --> 01:13:43,429
Shake it. Shake it.

1028
01:13:43,557 --> 01:13:45,467
Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy.

1029
01:13:46,352 --> 01:13:48,060
Attagirl!

1030
01:13:48,813 --> 01:13:51,434
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1031
01:13:51,565 --> 01:13:55,398
Everybody!
¶ Born to hand-jive, baby

1032
01:13:56,279 --> 01:13:59,565
¶ Born to hand-jive, baby

1033
01:14:01,368 --> 01:14:03,110
Here we go.

1034
01:14:03,995 --> 01:14:06,035
Hey, break it up! What is that?

1035
01:14:11,670 --> 01:14:13,165
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1036
01:14:14,422 --> 01:14:16,581
C'mon now, shake it!

1037
01:14:16,717 --> 01:14:18,092
Yeah.

1038
01:14:19,136 --> 01:14:20,547
Twist it!

1039
01:14:30,690 --> 01:14:32,018
Alright, get it!

1040
01:15:03,724 --> 01:15:05,468
¶ How low can you go?

1041
01:15:05,601 --> 01:15:07,345
¶ How low can you go?

1042
01:15:07,478 --> 01:15:09,056
¶ How low can you go?

1043
01:15:39,554 --> 01:15:40,632
There you go!

1044
01:15:42,765 --> 01:15:44,757
C'mon now, hand-jive!

1045
01:16:07,081 --> 01:16:09,324
That's the stuff!

1046
01:16:12,421 --> 01:16:13,998
Do it, baby!

1047
01:16:16,133 --> 01:16:17,710
Do it!

1048
01:16:28,311 --> 01:16:31,182
That's the hand-jive grand-jive!

1049
01:16:51,002 --> 01:16:53,375
Yeah, let's bring it up now!

1050
01:16:53,839 --> 01:16:54,918
Bring it on up!

1051
01:16:57,843 --> 01:16:59,006
Higher!

1052
01:16:59,136 --> 01:17:00,714
Higher.

1053
01:17:01,262 --> 01:17:04,347
Higher and higher!

1054
01:17:05,184 --> 01:17:08,102
¶ Now can you hand-jive, baby?

1055
01:17:08,979 --> 01:17:11,602
¶ Oh, can you hand-jive, baby?

1056
01:17:12,315 --> 01:17:13,941
¶ Oh, yeah

1057
01:17:18,155 --> 01:17:20,315
¶ Born to hand-jive, oh, yeah!

1058
01:17:20,450 --> 01:17:22,277
Oh, yeah!

1059
01:17:22,410 --> 01:17:24,568
Here they are, the new champs.

1060
01:17:24,703 --> 01:17:26,862
Come on up here.

1061
01:17:28,792 --> 01:17:33,003
- Can I have your names, please?
- Cha Cha di Gregorio and Danny Zuko.

1062
01:17:35,257 --> 01:17:37,415
- We'll do it now.
- Where's Marty?

1063
01:17:37,551 --> 01:17:40,006
- Don't worry, she's in good hands.
- Whose?

1064
01:17:42,473 --> 01:17:45,639
Now let's see our champs
in a spotlight dance.

1065
01:17:47,353 --> 01:17:51,481
- ¶ Blue moon
- ¶ Blue, blue, blue, blue moon

1066
01:17:51,607 --> 01:17:55,440
¶ You saw me standing alone

1067
01:17:58,406 --> 01:18:02,534
¶ Without a dream in my heart

1068
01:18:04,663 --> 01:18:08,790
¶ Without a love of my own...

1069
01:18:10,502 --> 01:18:13,075
Ready? One, one, two, three, go.

1070
01:18:13,213 --> 01:18:15,455
¶ Blue moon...

1071
01:18:19,636 --> 01:18:21,379
Who's that on the right?

1072
01:18:22,473 --> 01:18:25,888
We have pictures
of you so-called mooners.

1073
01:18:26,017 --> 01:18:30,478
Just because it's not your faces
doesn't mean we can't identify you.

1074
01:18:30,605 --> 01:18:34,651
At this very moment, those pictures
are on the way to Washington,

1075
01:18:34,776 --> 01:18:39,985
where the FBI has experts
in this type of identification.

1076
01:18:40,116 --> 01:18:44,861
If you turn yourselves in now,
you may escape a federal charge.

1077
01:19:07,644 --> 01:19:10,431
C'mon, Doody. Watch your hands.
Move it out.

1078
01:19:10,564 --> 01:19:12,937
I feel like a meatball in here.

1079
01:19:13,067 --> 01:19:15,189
Let's go find the chicks.

1080
01:19:15,986 --> 01:19:17,730
Marty. Marty.

1081
01:19:22,743 --> 01:19:26,076
Hold my money. Don't let me
go near the refreshment stand.

1082
01:19:26,205 --> 01:19:29,491
- I'm not hungry.
- Hey. What's happening?

1083
01:19:30,794 --> 01:19:32,833
There's nobody here.

1084
01:19:36,634 --> 01:19:39,717
Come on, Sandy.
I told you on the phone I was sorry.

1085
01:19:39,845 --> 01:19:43,047
- I know you did.
- You believe me, don't you?

1086
01:19:43,181 --> 01:19:46,385
Yes, but I still think
you and Cha Cha went together.

1087
01:19:47,478 --> 01:19:50,348
We did not go together.
We just went together.

1088
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:53,482
- It's the same thing.
- No. No.

1089
01:20:15,631 --> 01:20:17,672
- (screams)
- Ohh!

1090
01:20:17,801 --> 01:20:19,461
Sandy, I'm sorry.

1091
01:20:28,770 --> 01:20:30,597
Sandy...

1092
01:20:31,899 --> 01:20:34,140
Would you wear my ring?

1093
01:20:34,275 --> 01:20:36,731
Danny. I don't know what to say.

1094
01:20:36,862 --> 01:20:38,939
- Say, yes.
- Yes.

1095
01:20:43,786 --> 01:20:48,993
Danny, this means so much to me.
Cos I know now that you respect me.

1096
01:20:56,924 --> 01:20:58,253
Hey, Rizz?

1097
01:20:58,384 --> 01:20:59,796
Watch it.

1098
01:21:00,887 --> 01:21:04,802
- What's with you tonight?
- I feel like a defective typewriter.

1099
01:21:04,933 --> 01:21:07,506
- I skipped a period.
- You think you're PG?

1100
01:21:07,644 --> 01:21:09,102
I don't know. Big deal.

1101
01:21:09,228 --> 01:21:12,099
- Was it Kenickie?
- Nah, you don't know the guy.

1102
01:21:12,232 --> 01:21:14,024
Rizz, look, it's OK.

1103
01:21:14,151 --> 01:21:18,064
I caught Vince Fontaine putting
aspirin in my Coke at the dance.

1104
01:21:18,196 --> 01:21:19,192
Hey.

1105
01:21:19,323 --> 01:21:24,199
- Marty, you won't tell no one?
- Sure, I'll take it to the grave.

1106
01:21:28,208 --> 01:21:31,707
Coming through, coming through.
Come on, lady with a baby.

1107
01:21:34,881 --> 01:21:37,039
Hey, Marty, what's up?

1108
01:21:37,175 --> 01:21:39,002
Rizzo's pregnant.

1109
01:21:44,682 --> 01:21:46,723
Rizzo's got a bun in the oven.

1110
01:21:58,030 --> 01:21:59,857
Rizzo's knocked up.

1111
01:22:04,078 --> 01:22:06,117
Rizzo, I hear you're knocked up.

1112
01:22:06,246 --> 01:22:09,450
You do?
Boy, good news really travels fast.

1113
01:22:10,335 --> 01:22:12,374
Why didn't ya tell me about it?

1114
01:22:13,046 --> 01:22:14,669
What's it to ya?

1115
01:22:14,797 --> 01:22:17,917
- I might be able to do something.
- You did enough.

1116
01:22:19,719 --> 01:22:22,803
I don't run away from my mistakes.

1117
01:22:22,930 --> 01:22:27,011
Don't worry about it, Kenickie.
It was somebody else's mistake.

1118
01:22:32,649 --> 01:22:34,477
Thanks a lot, kid.

1119
01:22:35,444 --> 01:22:37,187
Any time.

1120
01:22:42,868 --> 01:22:45,324
- (sneezes)
- Are you getting a cold?

1121
01:22:45,455 --> 01:22:50,116
No. It's probably
a little drive-in dust, that's all.

1122
01:23:02,472 --> 01:23:04,844
- Danny!
- Sandy! Oh, Sandy...

1123
01:23:04,974 --> 01:23:07,015
Danny, what are you doing?

1124
01:23:07,144 --> 01:23:09,302
Don't worry, nobody's watchin'.

1125
01:23:09,437 --> 01:23:12,854
- Get off me.
- Sandy, what's the matter with you?

1126
01:23:13,816 --> 01:23:16,604
I thought I meant something to you.

1127
01:23:16,736 --> 01:23:21,944
Think I'm gonna stay with you in this
sin-wagon? Take this piece of tin!

1128
01:23:22,909 --> 01:23:25,400
Sandy, you can't walk out
of a drive-in!

1129
01:23:35,631 --> 01:23:38,087
¶ Stranded at the drive-in

1130
01:23:39,386 --> 01:23:42,672
¶ Branded a fool

1131
01:23:43,555 --> 01:23:46,011
¶ What will they say

1132
01:23:47,310 --> 01:23:50,181
¶ Monday at school?

1133
01:23:57,737 --> 01:23:59,777
¶ Sandy

1134
01:23:59,907 --> 01:24:01,983
¶ Can't you see

1135
01:24:02,117 --> 01:24:04,822
¶ I'm in misery?

1136
01:24:06,288 --> 01:24:08,328
¶ We made a start

1137
01:24:08,457 --> 01:24:10,615
¶ Now we're apart

1138
01:24:10,751 --> 01:24:13,955
¶ There's nothing left for me

1139
01:24:15,257 --> 01:24:17,295
¶ Love has flown

1140
01:24:17,424 --> 01:24:19,298
¶ All alone

1141
01:24:19,426 --> 01:24:23,555
¶ I sit and wonder why-aye-aye

1142
01:24:23,682 --> 01:24:27,098
¶ Why you left me

1143
01:24:28,185 --> 01:24:29,929
¶ Oh, Sandy

1144
01:24:31,397 --> 01:24:33,770
¶ Oh, Sandy

1145
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:35,977
¶ Maybe

1146
01:24:36,110 --> 01:24:37,855
¶ Someday

1147
01:24:37,988 --> 01:24:41,108
¶ When high school is done

1148
01:24:42,617 --> 01:24:46,069
¶ Somehow, some way

1149
01:24:46,831 --> 01:24:50,116
¶ Our two worlds will be one

1150
01:24:51,334 --> 01:24:53,292
¶ In heaven

1151
01:24:53,421 --> 01:24:55,460
¶ Forever

1152
01:24:55,589 --> 01:24:59,006
¶ And ever we will be

1153
01:25:00,094 --> 01:25:03,379
¶ Please, say you'll stay

1154
01:25:04,473 --> 01:25:06,715
¶ Oh, Sandy

1155
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:12,677
Sandy, my darling,

1156
01:25:12,815 --> 01:25:14,854
you hurt me real bad.

1157
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:17,983
You know it's true.

1158
01:25:18,738 --> 01:25:21,740
But, baby, you gotta believe me
when I say...

1159
01:25:23,534 --> 01:25:25,575
...l'm helpless without you.

1160
01:25:26,454 --> 01:25:28,531
¶ Love has flown

1161
01:25:28,666 --> 01:25:30,492
¶ All alone

1162
01:25:30,626 --> 01:25:34,670
¶ I sit, I wonder why-aye-aye

1163
01:25:34,797 --> 01:25:38,628
¶ Why you left me

1164
01:25:39,510 --> 01:25:41,966
¶ Oh, Sandy

1165
01:25:44,099 --> 01:25:46,137
¶ Sandy

1166
01:25:48,561 --> 01:25:50,719
¶ Sandy

1167
01:25:55,152 --> 01:25:58,852
¶ Why-aye-aye-aye?

1168
01:26:00,573 --> 01:26:02,400
Oh, Sandy!

1169
01:26:07,123 --> 01:26:09,079
Head it out. Come on, guys.

1170
01:26:16,215 --> 01:26:18,338
Well, the crate shaped up.

1171
01:26:18,468 --> 01:26:21,801
- It's as hot as the parts on it.
- We didn't steal all of it.

1172
01:26:21,929 --> 01:26:25,548
- Some of it was donated.
- Just wait till Thunder Road.

1173
01:26:25,683 --> 01:26:28,257
Right. You could still
change your mind.

1174
01:26:28,395 --> 01:26:32,059
- The flag is in three hours.
- And Greased Lightning strikes.

1175
01:26:32,189 --> 01:26:35,025
- You coming?
- My boys won't let me down,

1176
01:26:35,151 --> 01:26:37,025
and I won't let them down.

1177
01:26:39,656 --> 01:26:41,814
I wanna talk to you.

1178
01:26:44,035 --> 01:26:47,487
Those guys at Thunder Road
don't fool around, you know.

1179
01:26:48,958 --> 01:26:50,535
You want me to punk out?

1180
01:26:51,043 --> 01:26:53,913
No, I'm not saying punking out,
I'm just...

1181
01:26:55,214 --> 01:26:57,253
You know what I mean.

1182
01:26:58,634 --> 01:27:00,793
Hey, Danny, erm...

1183
01:27:00,929 --> 01:27:03,087
We been friends a long time, right?

1184
01:27:03,765 --> 01:27:05,388
Yeah.

1185
01:27:06,475 --> 01:27:09,263
You remember the drive-in
the other night?

1186
01:27:09,395 --> 01:27:12,895
The movie with the duel,
the guy's best friend went with him

1187
01:27:13,025 --> 01:27:15,147
as his lieutenant, his second?

1188
01:27:15,276 --> 01:27:17,103
Yeah. So?

1189
01:27:19,196 --> 01:27:23,776
Well, I thought that... you could
maybe be my second at Thunder Road.

1190
01:27:24,411 --> 01:27:27,281
What, you want me
to drive with you or what?

1191
01:27:38,884 --> 01:27:41,458
Listen, I'll pick you up at three,
alright?

1192
01:27:42,555 --> 01:27:46,054
Open up the door.
What are you sitting around for?

1193
01:27:46,183 --> 01:27:49,184
Take the can off
the front of the car, you putz.

1194
01:27:55,693 --> 01:27:58,363
Hello, Rizz.
Are you going to Thunder Road?

1195
01:27:58,488 --> 01:27:59,816
Not a chance.

1196
01:27:59,947 --> 01:28:02,106
I have to go.
I have to talk to Danny.

1197
01:28:02,242 --> 01:28:05,576
Without wheels and a motor,
he won't know you're alive.

1198
01:28:05,704 --> 01:28:09,404
We haven't been friends,
but if there's anything I can do...

1199
01:28:09,541 --> 01:28:13,585
I can take care of myself.
And anybody else who comes along.

1200
01:28:14,546 --> 01:28:17,880
You think I don't know
what people are saying about me?

1201
01:28:18,009 --> 01:28:19,668
Hey.

1202
01:28:23,430 --> 01:28:24,592
Thanks.

1203
01:28:35,109 --> 01:28:37,779
That's the one
I was telling you about.

1204
01:28:39,697 --> 01:28:42,983
¶ There are worse things I could do

1205
01:28:43,869 --> 01:28:47,368
¶ Than go with a boy or two

1206
01:28:48,665 --> 01:28:50,823
¶ Even though the neighbourhood

1207
01:28:50,959 --> 01:28:54,126
¶ Thinks I'm trashy and no good

1208
01:28:54,922 --> 01:28:58,006
¶ I suppose it could be true

1209
01:28:58,675 --> 01:29:02,377
¶ But there are worse things
I could do

1210
01:29:03,055 --> 01:29:08,013
¶ I could flirt with all the guys

1211
01:29:10,646 --> 01:29:15,308
¶ Smile at them and bat my eyes

1212
01:29:17,862 --> 01:29:21,480
¶ Press against them when we dance

1213
01:29:21,616 --> 01:29:25,032
¶ Make them think they stand a chance

1214
01:29:25,161 --> 01:29:28,448
¶ Then refuse to see it through

1215
01:29:29,748 --> 01:29:32,205
¶ That's a thing I'd never do

1216
01:29:32,877 --> 01:29:38,039
¶ I could stay home every night

1217
01:29:39,552 --> 01:29:43,881
¶ Wait around for Mr Right

1218
01:29:46,642 --> 01:29:50,058
¶ Take cold showers every day

1219
01:29:50,187 --> 01:29:53,057
¶ And throw my life away

1220
01:29:53,732 --> 01:29:56,817
¶ On a dream that won't come true

1221
01:29:58,946 --> 01:30:04,107
¶ I could hurt someone like me

1222
01:30:06,663 --> 01:30:12,037
¶ Out of spite orjealousy

1223
01:30:13,753 --> 01:30:17,038
¶ I don't steal and I don't lie

1224
01:30:17,173 --> 01:30:20,507
¶ But I can feel and I can cry

1225
01:30:20,635 --> 01:30:24,765
¶ A fact I'll bet you never knew

1226
01:30:28,352 --> 01:30:32,895
¶ But to cry in front of you

1227
01:30:35,234 --> 01:30:37,903
¶ That's the worst thing

1228
01:30:38,028 --> 01:30:42,074
¶ I could do

1229
01:31:26,913 --> 01:31:30,117
- You guys think you got a winner?
- That's right.

1230
01:31:30,250 --> 01:31:33,334
Takes more than a coat of paint
on Thunder Road.

1231
01:31:33,461 --> 01:31:36,582
- Oh, yeah?
- Not thinking of changing your mind?

1232
01:31:36,714 --> 01:31:39,551
- No way.
- Good. Cos we're racing for pinks.

1233
01:31:39,676 --> 01:31:41,171
Pinks?

1234
01:31:41,303 --> 01:31:43,876
Pinks, punk.
Pink slips. Ownership papers.

1235
01:31:47,726 --> 01:31:50,478
Stop. Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

1236
01:31:51,980 --> 01:31:54,021
Hey, get the dude, man.

1237
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:05,032
- What did she give him?
- A lock of hair. From her chest.

1238
01:32:07,538 --> 01:32:09,365
Poor Kenickie.

1239
01:32:11,877 --> 01:32:16,040
See a penny, pick it up,
all day long you'll have good luck.

1240
01:32:16,173 --> 01:32:17,999
Gimme that.

1241
01:32:20,635 --> 01:32:23,423
If it were in any better condition,
it would fly.

1242
01:32:23,555 --> 01:32:27,719
- She's gonna.
- I brought you this for good luck.

1243
01:32:27,850 --> 01:32:29,179
Gee, thanks.

1244
01:32:29,311 --> 01:32:31,019
- I'm sorry.
- I'll get it.

1245
01:32:36,902 --> 01:32:38,647
You putz!

1246
01:32:40,155 --> 01:32:41,615
Put this under his head.

1247
01:32:43,117 --> 01:32:46,284
- Zuko, he's out cold.
- What are we gonna do?

1248
01:32:46,412 --> 01:32:49,497
Kenickie. Talk to me, buddy.

1249
01:32:50,042 --> 01:32:51,665
You OK?

1250
01:32:52,668 --> 01:32:54,910
Yeah. I'm OK.

1251
01:32:55,046 --> 01:32:56,789
I'm fine. (groans)

1252
01:32:56,923 --> 01:33:00,339
- You can't drive.
- No, really, I'm alright.

1253
01:33:00,469 --> 01:33:02,626
I'm just seeing two of you, man.

1254
01:33:04,139 --> 01:33:07,840
- Hey, you want me to drive for you?
- Huh?

1255
01:33:07,977 --> 01:33:10,468
Yeah. Yeah.

1256
01:33:11,230 --> 01:33:12,807
Alright. Help him up.

1257
01:33:13,649 --> 01:33:16,056
Marty, give me a hand.

1258
01:33:22,158 --> 01:33:24,565
(car engines start)

1259
01:33:30,917 --> 01:33:32,577
Hey.

1260
01:33:32,710 --> 01:33:34,917
The rules are, there ain't no rules.

1261
01:33:35,046 --> 01:33:37,917
To the second bridge and back.
First one back wins.

1262
01:33:39,676 --> 01:33:41,419
Haul ass, kid.

1263
01:34:01,073 --> 01:34:03,315
You ain't gonna see me
for dust, Zuko.

1264
01:34:36,276 --> 01:34:37,474
Come on, baby.

1265
01:36:25,807 --> 01:36:29,639
¶ For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

1266
01:36:29,770 --> 01:36:33,980
¶ For he's a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny

1267
01:36:35,816 --> 01:36:38,487
¶ Look at me

1268
01:36:38,612 --> 01:36:41,614
¶ There has to be

1269
01:36:42,157 --> 01:36:44,115
¶ Something more

1270
01:36:44,243 --> 01:36:47,030
¶ Than what they see

1271
01:36:47,704 --> 01:36:50,278
¶ Wholesome and pure

1272
01:36:50,416 --> 01:36:53,951
¶ Oh, so scared and unsure

1273
01:36:54,086 --> 01:36:58,832
¶ A poor man's Sandra Dee

1274
01:36:58,966 --> 01:37:00,294
Danny won.

1275
01:37:00,426 --> 01:37:02,882
- Isn't that great?
- Yeah.

1276
01:37:05,015 --> 01:37:07,552
What's the matter? Aren't you happy?

1277
01:37:07,683 --> 01:37:11,728
Not really. But I think I know a way
I could be. Could you help me?

1278
01:37:12,313 --> 01:37:14,472
- Of course.
- Can I come to your place?

1279
01:37:14,607 --> 01:37:16,233
Sure. Come on.

1280
01:37:20,863 --> 01:37:25,823
¶ Sandy, you must start anew

1281
01:37:26,578 --> 01:37:30,956
¶ Don't you know what you must do?

1282
01:37:31,083 --> 01:37:33,325
¶ Hold your head high

1283
01:37:33,460 --> 01:37:37,839
- ¶ Take a deep breath and sigh...
- Come on, Sandy.

1284
01:37:37,965 --> 01:37:39,958
¶ Goodbye

1285
01:37:40,093 --> 01:37:46,262
¶ To Sandra Dee

1286
01:38:02,240 --> 01:38:03,782
Attention, seniors.

1287
01:38:03,909 --> 01:38:07,029
Before the merriment
of commencement commences,

1288
01:38:07,162 --> 01:38:10,366
I hope your years with us here
at Rydell High

1289
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:13,583
have prepared you
for the challenges you face.

1290
01:38:13,711 --> 01:38:18,337
Who knows, among you, there may be
a future Eleanor Roosevelt,

1291
01:38:18,466 --> 01:38:20,873
or a Rosemary Clooney.

1292
01:38:21,010 --> 01:38:23,335
And among you young men,
there may be

1293
01:38:23,471 --> 01:38:26,804
a Joe DiMaggio,
a President Eisenhower

1294
01:38:26,932 --> 01:38:29,803
or even a Vice President Nixon.

1295
01:38:29,936 --> 01:38:34,978
But always you will have
the glorious memories of Rydell High.

1296
01:38:35,108 --> 01:38:38,025
Rydell forever. Bon voyage.

1297
01:38:39,070 --> 01:38:41,229
(chimes)

1298
01:38:44,576 --> 01:38:47,150
Oh, Blanche, stop blubbering.

1299
01:38:52,167 --> 01:38:53,994
(cheering)

1300
01:39:28,288 --> 01:39:31,040
- How many?
- One.

1301
01:39:32,250 --> 01:39:33,792
(bell rings)

1302
01:39:35,587 --> 01:39:38,257
I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.

1303
01:39:38,382 --> 01:39:39,924
How did I flunk phys ed?

1304
01:39:40,050 --> 01:39:41,629
Did I take phys ed?

1305
01:39:43,262 --> 01:39:46,713
Step right up here!
It's for a wonderful cause.

1306
01:39:46,849 --> 01:39:51,392
The Teachers' Retirement Fund.
Give 'em a pie in the puss.

1307
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:53,763
Coach, how could you flunk
the T-Birds?

1308
01:39:53,899 --> 01:39:57,848
Don't worry. You'll get diplomas.
Just come back to summer school.

1309
01:39:57,985 --> 01:40:00,441
- Summer school?
- Look out!

1310
01:40:03,116 --> 01:40:06,116
If you'd come to class,
you wouldn't have missed me.

1311
01:40:06,243 --> 01:40:08,652
Wise guy, huh? Take that, Coach!

1312
01:40:10,624 --> 01:40:12,949
Why, you couldn't pitch one inning.

1313
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:20,123
- What's your name? I want you.
- Eugene.

1314
01:40:20,259 --> 01:40:22,964
- You're a great pitcher.
- Thank you.

1315
01:40:32,522 --> 01:40:35,523
Rizzo! Rizzo!

1316
01:40:35,649 --> 01:40:38,058
Get off of that. You got a condition.

1317
01:40:38,195 --> 01:40:42,026
Forget it. It was a false alarm.
I'm not pregnant.

1318
01:40:42,156 --> 01:40:43,781
Whoo-hooo!

1319
01:40:47,079 --> 01:40:49,487
I'll, erm,
make an honest woman of you.

1320
01:40:50,041 --> 01:40:53,326
Listen, fella, if this is a line,
I ain't biting.

1321
01:40:54,210 --> 01:40:55,955
That's a bona fide offer.

1322
01:40:56,088 --> 01:40:58,758
Well, it ain't moonlight and roses,
but...

1323
01:41:06,932 --> 01:41:10,432
- Hey, there's Zuko.
- You gotta be kidding, man!

1324
01:41:12,980 --> 01:41:16,515
- What is this? Halloween?
- Where did you swipe the sweater?

1325
01:41:16,651 --> 01:41:20,435
While you tools were out stealing
hubcaps, I lettered in track.

1326
01:41:20,571 --> 01:41:23,276
I can't believe it.
Danny Zuko turned jock?

1327
01:41:23,408 --> 01:41:26,611
- That's right, I did.
- What you doing? Deserting us?

1328
01:41:26,744 --> 01:41:29,615
You guys can't follow a leader
all your lives.

1329
01:41:30,499 --> 01:41:33,999
Come on, you know you mean
a lot to me, but Sandy does, too.

1330
01:41:34,128 --> 01:41:36,499
I'm gonna do anything I can
to get her.

1331
01:41:40,884 --> 01:41:42,961
(wolf whistles)

1332
01:41:48,434 --> 01:41:50,058
Sandy?

1333
01:41:51,354 --> 01:41:53,430
Tell me about it, stud.

1334
01:42:01,572 --> 01:42:03,530
¶ I got chills

1335
01:42:03,658 --> 01:42:05,615
¶ They're multiplyin'

1336
01:42:05,952 --> 01:42:10,412
¶ And I'm losing control

1337
01:42:10,539 --> 01:42:12,580
¶ Cos the power

1338
01:42:12,709 --> 01:42:14,702
¶ You're supplyin'

1339
01:42:14,836 --> 01:42:17,244
¶ It's electrifyin'

1340
01:42:23,971 --> 01:42:25,844
¶ You better shape up

1341
01:42:26,390 --> 01:42:28,632
¶ Cos I need a man

1342
01:42:29,602 --> 01:42:32,092
¶ And my heart is set on you

1343
01:42:33,063 --> 01:42:35,222
¶ You better shape up

1344
01:42:35,357 --> 01:42:37,149
¶ You better understand

1345
01:42:38,695 --> 01:42:40,853
¶ To my heart I must be true

1346
01:42:40,989 --> 01:42:44,488
¶ Nothin' left,
nothin' left for me to do

1347
01:42:44,617 --> 01:42:47,239
- ¶ You're the one that I want
- ¶ You are the one I want

1348
01:42:47,370 --> 01:42:49,161
¶ Ooh, ooh, ooh, honey

1349
01:42:49,288 --> 01:42:51,578

¶ Ooh, ooh, ooh

1353
01:42:57,839 --> 01:42:59,713
¶ The one I need

1354
01:42:59,842 --> 01:43:02,130
¶ Oh, yes indeed

1355
01:43:07,057 --> 01:43:11,304
¶ If you're filled with affection

1356
01:43:11,437 --> 01:43:15,683
¶ You're too shy to convey

1357
01:43:15,815 --> 01:43:20,360
¶ Meditate in my direction

1358
01:43:21,114 --> 01:43:23,486
- ¶ Feel your way
- Wow!

1359
01:43:24,993 --> 01:43:27,032
¶ I better shape up

1360
01:43:27,161 --> 01:43:30,577
- ¶ Cos you need a man
- ¶ I need a man

1361
01:43:30,706 --> 01:43:33,281
¶ Who can keep me satisfied

1362
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:36,332
¶ I better shape up

1363
01:43:36,463 --> 01:43:39,546
- ¶ If I'm gonna prove
- ¶ You better prove

1364
01:43:39,674 --> 01:43:41,964
¶ That my faith is justified

1365
01:43:42,094 --> 01:43:45,628
- ¶ Are you sure?
- ¶ Yes, I'm sure down deep inside

1366
01:43:45,764 --> 01:43:48,469
- ¶ You're the one that I want
- ¶ You are the one I want

1367
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:50,260
¶ Ooh, ooh, ooh, honey

¶ Oh, yes indeed

1374

Look! The gang's together.

1402
01:45:07,975 --> 01:45:10,098
What will we do after graduation?

1403
01:45:10,227 --> 01:45:12,800
Maybe we'll never see each other.

1404
01:45:12,938 --> 01:45:15,180
- That won't happen.
- How do you know?

¶ Whaa-whaa, whaa-whaaaa

1421
01:46:05,033 --> 01:46:06,528
¶ When we go out at night

1422
01:46:07,245 --> 01:46:09,202
¶ And stars are shining bright

1423
01:46:09,330 --> 01:46:12,830
¶ Up in the skies above

1424
01:46:13,584 --> 01:46:15,542
¶ Or at the high-school dance

¶ Maybe it might be love

1427
01:46:22,176 --> 01:46:24,585
¶ Rama lama lama

¶ Like a wop ba ba lu bop
And wop bam boom

1431
01:47:12,396 --> 01:47:16,440
¶ Just like my brother is
Sha na na na yippity dip de doom

01:48:40,654 --> 01:48:44,154
¶ There ain't no danger
we can go too far

1441
01:48:44,283 --> 01:48:46,323
¶ We start believin' now

1442
01:48:46,452 --> 01:48:48,528
¶ That we can be who we are

1443
01:48:48,663 --> 01:48:50,701
¶ Grease is the word

1444

¶ Why don't they understand?

¶ We stop the fight right now

1450
01:49:08,808 --> 01:49:10,766

1457
01:49:31,957 --> 01:49:35,124
¶ We take the pressure
and we throw away

1458
01:49:35,253 --> 01:49:37,210
¶ Conventionality

1459
01:49:37,588 --> 01:49:40,080
¶ Belongs to yesterday

¶ There is a chance
that we can make it so far

1461
01:49:44,053 --> 01:49:46,296
¶ We start believin' now

1462
01:49:46,432 --> 01:49:48,589

1463
01:49:48,725 --> 01:49:50,053

¶ Wrapped up in troubles

1472
01:50:12,833 --> 01:50:14,292
¶ Laced in confusion

1473
01:50:14,418 --> 01:50:17,788
¶ What are we doing here?
