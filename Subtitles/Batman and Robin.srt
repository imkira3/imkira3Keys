1
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,490
I want a car.

2
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,490
Chicks dig the car.

3
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,450
This is why Superman works alone.

4
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:38,420
Do try and bring this one
back in one piece, sir!

5
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,620
Don't wait up, Al.

6
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,830
I'll canceI the pizzas.

7
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,220
<i>Batman,</i>

8
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,640
<i>a new villain has commandeered
the Gotham Museum.</i>

9
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,690
<i>He's frozen
the antiquities wing.</i>

10
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,360
<i>He's turned
the security guards into ice.</i>

11
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,820
<i>He's calling himself, "Mr. Freeze. "</i>

12
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,860
Mr. Freeze.

13
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,720
Stop! Drop your weapon...

14
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,220
...or we'll shoot!

15
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,690
The Iceman Cometh.

16
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,450
Please, show some mercy.

17
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,990
Mercy?!

18
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,910
I'm afraid that my condition has
left me cold to your pleas of mercy.

19
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,810
In this universe...

20
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,480
...there's only one absolute.

21
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,570
Everything...

22
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,570
...freezes.

23
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,280
Hi, Freeze.

24
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:11,740
I'm Batman.

25
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,100
You're not sending me to the cooler.

26
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:51,950
Nice catch.

27
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,580
You break it, you buy it.

28
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,120
Grab the gem!
Kill the heroes!

29
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,390
Kill them! Kill them!

30
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,430
Destroy everything!

31
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,940
It's the hockey team from hell.

32
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:03,730
Get the ice...

33
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,440
...I'll get the Iceman.

34
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,720
Thanks.

35
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,110
Sweet.

36
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,490
I got mine.

37
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,570
Where's yours?

38
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,910
What killed the dinosaurs?

39
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,410
The Ice Age!

40
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,840
Hit me, boys.

41
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,600
Thanks for playing.

42
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,290
I was hoping you'd drop in.

43
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,600
Watch the numbers...

44
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:32,270
...for they are
the harbingers of your doom.

45
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,480
Can you feeI it coming?

46
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,570
The icy cold of space.

47
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:41,950
At 30,000 feet,
your heart will freeze...

48
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:44,370
...and beat no more.

49
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:57,710
After you're frozen, your icy tomb
will plummet back to Gotham.

50
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,380
Freeze, you're mad.

51
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,340
This capsule explodes,
it'll slaughter thousands.

52
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:03,680
Freeze well.

53
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,660
- Who invited you?
- I was hanging around.

54
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:32,660
I thought you'd stay in the museum,
round up some thugs.

55
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,580
How about, "Nice to see you.
Thanks for saving my life. "

56
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:49,600
A Batbomb?

57
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:52,560
We must blow this up
before it turns Gotham into a crater.

58
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:55,940
Now what, call a taxi?!

59
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,110
Watch the first step!

60
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,360
Surf's up!

61
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,690
Gotcha!

62
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,190
Cowabunga!

63
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:05,130
He's freezing the furnace!

64
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,840
I got him.

65
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,060
Stay cooI...

66
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,680
...Birdboy.

67
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,200
Can you be cold?
You have 11 minutes to thaw the bird.

68
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,570
Will you chase the villain...

69
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,700
...or save him?

70
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,240
Emotion makes you weak.

71
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,870
That's why this day is mine.

72
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,330
I'll kill you next time!

73
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,380
Did we get him?

74
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,310
Drats!

75
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:28,400
My experiment to mate the orchid and
the rattlesnake has failed again...

76
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:33,660
...but I still have hope for
the animaI-plant crossbreedings.

77
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,700
If I can only find
the right dose of venom...

78
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:41,370
...these plants will be able to
fight back, like animals.

79
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,920
I will have given flora...

80
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,670
...a chance against
the thoughtless ravages of man.

81
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,300
PersonaI note:

82
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,840
My work would proceed faster...

83
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:59,560
...if Dr. Woodrue didn't whisk
my venom samples...

84
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:02,600
...back to his mysterious
Gilgamesh Wing.

85
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,440
Why won't he let me in the lab?

86
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,730
What is he doing in there?

87
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:31,550
Ladies and gentlemen
of the un-United Nations...

88
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:33,090
...and...

89
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,340
...our mystery bidder...

90
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,430
...may I present...

91
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,720
...Antonio Diego...

92
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:44,390
...seriaI murderer, serving life...

93
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,520
...in prison...

94
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,690
...and sole surviving...

95
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,480
...volunteer.

96
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,190
And what a charmer he is.

97
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:58,870
By merely drilling three
concentric holes directly...

98
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,910
...into Antonio's craniaI cavity...
I have...

99
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,120
...created viaducts into
the most primitive part of his brain...

100
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,960
...the limbic system.

101
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,340
And now I add...

102
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,510
...my Super-Soldier Serum...

103
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,300
...code-named...

104
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:19,890
..."Venom"...

105
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:23,270
...to which I add
my very own recipe of steroids...

106
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,140
...and toxins.

107
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,480
Plug him in.

108
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,150
Time to scream.

109
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,310
Genius!

110
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,680
Behold...

111
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:09,560
...the ideaI killing machine!

112
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,940
I call this little number...

113
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,570
..."Bane. "

114
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,110
Bane of Humanity!

115
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,200
Imagine it.

116
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:22,660
Your own private army made up of
thousands of these super-soldiers.

117
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,240
Bidding begins at a mere...

118
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,870
...10 million!

119
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,040
Turbo!

120
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,290
Show off for Daddy.

121
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,460
Dr. Isley.

122
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,090
Welcome to my parlor.

123
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,420
What?

124
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:22,090
You monster!

125
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,890
How could you?!

126
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:27,430
Our originaI sponsor had
no stomach for military applications.

127
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,730
He cut the funding for our work.

128
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,810
Without your research...

129
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,560
...I couldn't have come this far.

130
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:34,650
Join me.

131
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:38,110
The two of us,
entwined, side by side.

132
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,110
Join you?

133
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:44,360
I have spent my life trying to
protect plants from extinction...

134
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:45,910
...and now you...

135
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,450
...corrupt my research...

136
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:52,290
...into some maniacaI scheme for
world domination.

137
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,040
When I get through...

138
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:00,920
...you won't be able to get a job
teaching high schooI chemistry.

139
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:02,550
Do you hear me?!

140
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,930
You psycho!

141
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,430
Well...

142
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,600
...I can respect your opinion.

143
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:13,480
Sadly, I'm not good at rejection.

144
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,770
I'm afraid you'll have to die.

145
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:45,340
Let the poisons and toxins
burn a grave for you...

146
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:48,180
...deep into the earth
you love so much!

147
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,970
Bye-bye, dear!

148
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,890
Fellow maniacs...

149
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,730
...bidding...

150
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:55,640
...begins!

151
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:06,150
Gotham University Labs
security video, 2 years ago.

152
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,280
Dr. Victor Fries...

153
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:13,790
...2-time Olympic decathlete and NobeI
Prize winner for molecular biology.

154
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,540
After his wife
contracted a rare disease...

155
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,000
...Macgregor's Syndrome...

156
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,380
...he hoped to freeze her in a cryogenic
sleep untiI he could find a cure.

157
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:24,210
Now, here's where
everything goes north.

158
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,390
That's got to hurt.

159
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,980
That liquid is 50 below.

160
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,230
But, he survived somehow.

161
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,520
The cryo-solution mutated his body.

162
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,860
- What happened to his wife?
- No one knows.

163
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,530
She's presumed dead.

164
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,700
Freeze needs
extreme cold to survive.

165
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:56,830
His cryo-suit uses diamond-enhanced
lasers to keep him at zero degrees.

166
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:01,210
If it's ice the Iceman wants...

167
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:12,970
Coming, sir.

168
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,850
Yes, sir?

169
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,810
We need the Wayne diamonds.

170
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,770
We going to trap a snowman?

171
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:24,610
Yes, right after you spend
10 hours in the simulator, training.

172
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:28,200
I made a mistake. I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

173
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,450
You were reckless
and almost got killed.

174
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,910
I'm fine! See!
Me, here, alive!

175
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,240
How we supposed to work together
if you won't trust me?

176
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,250
How indeed?

177
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,920
He's overeager, he's impulsive.

178
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:46,420
I can't trust him not to get hurt.

179
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:50,590
Perhaps the truth is
you really don't trust anyone.

180
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:54,050
Don't tell me
you're on his side again.

181
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,100
Despite all your talents...

182
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:00,480
...you're still just
a novice in the ways of family.

183
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,480
Master Dick...

184
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:04,110
...follows the same star as you...

185
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,320
...but gets there by his own course.

186
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:11,660
You must learn to trust him,
for that is the nature of family.

187
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,490
I trust you, Alfred.

188
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,950
But I shan't be here forever.

189
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,290
Good night, Master Bruce.

190
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:26,920
Good night, Alfred.

191
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,530
Oh, dear, Master Bruce.

192
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:52,110
Good gracious, what a tumble.

193
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,490
There's a brave boy.

194
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:04,370
Yes, sir.

195
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:08,550
I am so pleased you won the bidding,
Your Supreme Ruthlessness.

196
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,920
We're making the finaI modifications
on Bane right now.

197
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:16,970
We'll have a flawless super-soldier
out to you tomorrow by overnight maiI.

198
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,910
Dr. Isley?

199
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,540
Pamela?

200
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:45,210
You look great.

201
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:47,960
Especially for a dead woman.

202
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,920
Hello, Jason.

203
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:54,930
I think I've had a change of heart.

204
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,430
Or quite...

205
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,930
...literally...

206
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:03,060
...the animaI-plant toxins had
a rather unique effect on me.

207
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:05,890
They replaced my blood with aloe...

208
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:09,150
...my skin with chlorophyll...

209
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,940
...and filled...

210
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,940
...my lips...

211
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,540
...with venom.

212
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,040
And, Jason, one other thing.

213
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,590
I probably
should have mentioned this earlier...

214
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,630
...I'm...

215
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,890
...poison.

216
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,400
It's a jungle in here.

217
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:51,570
I am Nature's arm...

218
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,110
...her spirit...

219
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:55,820
...her will!

220
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,530
Hell, I am Mother Nature.

221
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,700
And the time has come...

222
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,790
...for plants to take back...

223
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:06,790
...the world so rightfully ours...

224
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,500
...because it's not nice...

225
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:12,420
...to fooI with Mother Nature.

226
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,680
"Wayne Enterprises. "

227
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,060
Coming, Bane, darling.

228
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,310
We've got a plane to catch.

229
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,790
<i>I'm Mr. Icicle</i>

230
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,920
<i>I'm Mr. Ten Below</i>

231
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,540
Sing! Sing!

232
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,090
Come on, sing!

233
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,680
Louder! Come on!

234
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:03,760
Sing! Sing! Sing!

235
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:05,720
<i>He's Mr. White Christmas</i>

236
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,470
Louder!

237
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,810
<i>He's Mr. Icicle</i>

238
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,270
Freezy...

239
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,520
...I'm feeling hot.

240
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:17,650
I find that unlikely.

241
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,860
So my hair is
brittle and my skin is dry...

242
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:24,240
...I'd weather blizzards to have you.

243
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:27,040
You're the most perfect man
I've ever known.

244
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,330
Let's heat things up.

245
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,080
My passion thaws
for my bride alone.

246
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,210
Talk about your cold shoulder.

247
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:42,720
Frosty!

248
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:44,140
Yeah, boss?

249
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,510
Energy.

250
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,270
Battling the Bat
exhausted my power.

251
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,150
But...

252
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,690
...I was successfuI nevertheless.

253
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,200
Absolutely, boss.

254
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,990
One more giant diamond of this size...

255
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,160
...and my freezing engine
will be complete.

256
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:12,790
I will freeze the city.

257
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:16,080
Then I will hold Gotham ransom.

258
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,670
Unless the city bows
to my demands...

259
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,630
...it's winter forever
in Gotham.

260
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,680
The city fathers
will have no choice...

261
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,800
...but to give me the billions
I need to complete my research...

262
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,140
...so I can find a cure.

263
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,850
Leave us.

264
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,190
Sure, boss.

265
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:40,440
We need quality time.

266
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,920
Soon we will be together
once more.

267
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,460
Soon.

268
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:26,610
I'll get it.

269
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,710
I must've dozed off.
My sincerest apologies.

270
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,500
No apology necessary.

271
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:44,510
It's the first time it's happened
in thirty years.

272
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,230
Please be looking for me.

273
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,400
Actually, I'm looking for
Alfred Pennyworth.

274
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:08,490
Uncle Alfred!

275
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,070
My dear.

276
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,030
Oh, my dear...

277
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,700
...what a most wonderfuI surprise.

278
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:17,870
How did you manage
to come here all the way from England?

279
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,880
My dear, you are so kind
to your old uncle.

280
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,460
Uncle?

281
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,260
Barbara is the daughter
of my dear sister Margaret.

282
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:33,220
Both my parents were killed
in a car accident 5 years ago.

283
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:35,770
Uncle Alfred's been supporting me
ever since.

284
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,730
- You have?
- Secrets, Al?

285
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:42,060
Secrets are a virtuaI prerequisite
in this house.

286
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,940
Don't you think, sir?

287
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,360
I'm on break from-

288
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:48,610
Oxbridge Academy,
Alfred's alma mater.

289
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:51,780
The new computer sciences division.

290
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:54,950
- How'd you know?
- Says so on the patch on your sweater.

291
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:03,590
- What is it? It's beautifuI.
- You can say that again.

292
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:06,920
It's a competition racer.
I've been fixing it up.

293
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:08,420
I'll show you how to ride it.

294
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:10,430
You certainly will not!

295
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:14,260
Don't worry, Uncle Alfred.
I'm terrified of these things.

296
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:16,640
Barbara, I hope you'll stay with us.

297
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,810
Oh, I don't know.

298
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:22,190
All this luxury really isn't
my style, but...

299
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,190
...yeah, I'd love to.

300
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,150
Then it's settled.

301
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:28,820
But, sir, we...

302
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:31,320
...we do get so busy here.

303
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:32,610
Don't be silly.

304
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,450
After all, she's family.

305
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,880
Uncle Alfred?

306
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,850
I came to tuck you in.

307
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,350
You came to tuck me in?

308
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,350
That's quite a switch.

309
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,150
What're you working on?

310
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:07,860
I'm trying to find my brother,
your Uncle Wilfred.

311
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:11,990
He's first butler
to the Maharajah of Miranjapore.

312
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,160
But Miranjapore is a floating court.

313
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:17,160
It travels through India.

314
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:19,200
I remember Mom getting postcards.

315
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:22,540
So Wilfred can be
rather difficult to find.

316
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:27,090
I don't suppose they have
fax machines on elephants.

317
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,380
I've been trying to reach him
with no success.

318
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:35,220
When one grows ancient,
one yearns for family.

319
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:40,390
I have the same picture of Mom
by my bed.

320
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,680
Peg?

321
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:44,520
My nickname for sweet Margaret.

322
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:49,400
It's good to see you again.

323
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,400
I've missed you.

324
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:54,400
As I have you.

325
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,240
Sleep well, child.

326
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:00,080
You sleep.

327
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,910
Go to bed.

328
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,310
<i>Good morning, Gotham.</i>

329
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:15,280
<i>It's Gossip Gerty reporting to you
direct from the Gotham Observatory...</i>

330
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:19,990
<i>...where billionaire Bruce Wayne,
chairman of Wayne Enterprises...</i>

331
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:25,160
<i>...is about to make yet another
legendary contribution to the city.</i>

332
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,830
Gotham Observatory, Bane.

333
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:31,040
And step on it.

334
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,380
Step.

335
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:46,850
<i>My father told me, "To succeed,
we need only pick a star and follow it. "</i>

336
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:51,810
<i>So Wayne Enterprises is donating
the world's most advanced telescope...</i>

337
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:55,190
<i>...to Gotham's
Observatory Restoration Project.</i>

338
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,650
<i>With any luck...</i>

339
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:59,780
...this telescope will give
future generations a chance...

340
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:02,030
...to follow their own stars.

341
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:05,410
Brucy...

342
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:09,620
...is it true that this new telescope
can see around the globe?

343
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:12,540
Yes. If you'll watch
these monitors right here.

344
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:18,260
Satellites in orbit allow us to reflect
light from anywhere on the planet.

345
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,050
From here, we'll be able
to see the sky anywhere on Earth...

346
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:25,010
...and through this
intricate network of satellites...

347
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:29,560
...reflect it back to our
very own Gotham City for observation.

348
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:32,100
Just don't point it at my bedroom.

349
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,070
Brucy, you and the exquisite
Julie Madison...

350
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,820
...have been going out forever.

351
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:44,240
Are you going to tie the knot?

352
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:45,240
Marriage?

353
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:47,410
Marriage?

354
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,870
You want to give me a hand here?

355
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:52,580
Bruce and I are recklessly in love.

356
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:56,460
And that's most certainly
enough for us... for now.

357
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,880
If you will follow me,
I'll show you the centraI controI grid.

358
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,930
You're a lot of help.

359
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,100
Miss, you need to stop.

360
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,560
Move, fascist bulldog!

361
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,930
- You need an appointment-
- No, I don't!

362
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:13,060
Miss, you're not authorized
to be up here.

363
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:14,440
She has no pass, sir.

364
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,400
Little overly protective,
but you won't hurt me, Miss-?

365
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:19,230
Dr. Pamela Isley.

366
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,610
Doctor...

367
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,320
...what can I do for you?

368
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,910
Actually, I already
work for you, or did.

369
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,780
Your arboreaI preservation project
in South America.

370
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:31,620
We cut our funding.
There was a conflict of ideologies.

371
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:33,420
Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.

372
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,750
I see you knew him.

373
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,960
Yes. That lab burnt down last week.
I'm glad you escaped.

374
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:43,470
I have here a proposaI showing
how Wayne Enterprises can immediately...

375
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:46,640
...cease all actions
that toxify our environment.

376
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,140
Forget the stars,
look here at the earth...

377
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:50,890
...our mother, our womb.

378
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:54,190
She deserves your loyalty
and protection.

379
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,980
And yet, you spoiI her lands...

380
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:58,770
...poison her oceans...

381
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,190
...blacken her skies!

382
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,650
You're killing her!

383
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:06,280
Your intentions are noble,
but no dieseI fueI for heat...

384
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:11,330
...no coolants to preserve food,
millions of people would die.

385
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:14,250
Acceptable losses
in the battle to save the planet.

386
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,420
People come first, Dr. Isley.

387
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,670
Mammals!

388
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:23,510
A day of reckoning is coming.

389
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:24,800
That's right.

390
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:27,680
The same plants and flowers
that saw you...

391
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,760
...crawI from the primordiaI soup...

392
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:35,270
...will reclaim this planet
and there will be no one to protect you!

393
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,480
You must be new in town.

394
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:42,650
In Gotham City...

395
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:45,150
...Batman and Robin protect us...

396
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,990
...even from plants and flowers.

397
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:53,200
Maybe you'd like to meet them.

398
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:56,250
Caped crusaders are
going to help us auction...

399
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:59,000
...a diamond to raise money
for our botanicaI gardens.

400
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:03,840
Just a few mammals doing what
we can for the world's plants.

401
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:05,670
Thank you all for coming.

402
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,130
Good day, Doctor.

403
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,730
Batman and Robin...

404
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:22,690
...militant arm
of the warm-blooded oppressors...

405
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:27,150
...animaI protectors of the status quo.

406
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,700
First...

407
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:33,580
...I'll rid myself of the fur
and feathered pests.

408
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:36,830
And then Gotham...

409
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,540
...will be mine...

410
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,500
...for the greening.

411
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:03,020
Excuse me, chief.

412
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:05,900
I got something here
you might want to see.

413
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:15,540
I hate when people talk
during the movie.

414
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:37,100
One more diamond, my love.

415
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,810
One more.

416
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:49,400
"Bruce Wayne. Diamonds. "

417
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,120
Very nice.

418
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:40,540
Ladies and gentlemen...

419
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,710
...Gossip Gerty
of "Good Morning Gotham" and I...

420
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:49,090
...welcome you
to the gem of the evening.

421
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:52,550
Our own Commissioner Gordon...

422
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:54,300
...displaying...

423
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:57,890
...the famed Heart of Isis,
on loan...

424
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:02,640
...from the collection of my
close personaI friend, Bruce Wayne.

425
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,560
Think Freeze will take the bait?

426
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,320
He'll be here.

427
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:12,780
...to dance with one
of our fabulous flowers...

428
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:16,570
...the famed diamond
draped around her neck.

429
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,910
Let's start the bidding!

430
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:24,960
I'll give 10,000 for the orchid!

431
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,340
20,000 for the tiger lily!

432
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,550
And I bid...

433
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:36,510
...30,000 dollars
for the lovely magnolia!

434
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:43,600
Boys, please...

435
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,690
...let's show some gusto!

436
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,110
Hi, there.

437
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,070
And you are?

438
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,150
Poison...

439
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,900
...Poison Ivy.

440
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:14,210
Why not send junior home early?

441
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:17,920
I've got some wild oats to sow.

442
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,380
On the other hand...

443
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,510
...youth does have its advantages.

444
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:28,810
Endurance, stamina.

445
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:31,810
Forget the geriatric Bat.

446
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,650
Come, join me.

447
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:36,110
My garden needs tending.

448
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:38,070
I'll take it from here, paI.

449
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:40,400
Wouldn't you like the earrings too?

450
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:45,570
Some lucky boy's
about to hit the honey pot.

451
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:49,870
I'll include an evening of my company
for the winner.

452
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:53,000
I'll bring everything you see here...

453
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:56,540
...plus everything you don't.

454
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:01,260
I bid 50,000 dollars for Poison Ivy!

455
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:06,260
100,000!

456
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:08,850
And I'll bid...

457
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:12,270
...500,000 dollars!

458
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:15,270
One million dollars.

459
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:19,150
-2 million.
- You don't have it. 3 million.

460
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,820
I'll borrow it from you. Four.

461
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:22,990
5 million.

462
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:24,780
That's a utility belt, not a money belt.

463
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:25,990
6 million.

464
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,070
7 million.

465
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:32,080
Never leave the cave without it.

466
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:35,830
You boys aren't going to start fighting
over little old me, now are you?

467
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,850
All right, everyone!
Chill.

468
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:54,020
Chill.

469
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,280
Get the gun!

470
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,950
Look at you!

471
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,030
Let me guess.

472
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:53,910
Plant GirI?

473
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:56,080
Vine Lady?

474
00:46:56,830 --> 00:46:59,080
Hand over the diamond, Garden GaI...

475
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:01,080
...or I'll turn you into mulch.

476
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:07,550
Pheromone dust...

477
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:09,800
...designed to heat...

478
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:11,390
...a man's blood.

479
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:14,260
Doesn't work on the cold-hearted.
If you please!

480
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:17,310
If you insist.

481
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:23,320
Clever little clover.

482
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,570
That's my exit cue.

483
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:31,280
Thanks.

484
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:43,790
Good night.

485
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,590
CooI party!

486
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:18,290
Commissioner, you have 11 minutes
to thaw these people.

487
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:28,760
Miss Ivy, you've just met
one of the most sinister men in Gotham.

488
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:31,170
That's not a man...

489
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:33,340
...that is a god.

490
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:41,390
Enough monkey business.

491
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:44,480
We've got work to do.

492
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,940
Monkey work.

493
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,080
You can't make the jump.

494
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,410
I can!

495
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:43,910
Pull back!

496
00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:45,420
I can make it!

497
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:47,210
Redbird controI codes.

498
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:51,510
Disable engine.

499
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:54,630
Don't do it to me!

500
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:04,180
We won't make it!

501
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:29,380
It's a cold town.

502
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:02,280
I could've made that jump.

503
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:05,370
You could've splattered your brains
on the building's side.

504
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:07,250
The Flying Graysons were a team.

505
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,420
We had to trust each to do his job.

506
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:11,630
That's what being partners is about.

507
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:14,250
Counting on someone is the way to win.

508
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:16,760
Your head wasn't on the job.
It was on Poison Ivy.

509
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,510
Maybe she wanted me instead of you.

510
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,470
That's your idea of friendship?

511
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:24,310
It's your rules.
It's your way, or the highway.

512
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:27,140
It's Batman and Robin,
not Robin and Batman.

513
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:30,520
- I'm sick of it!
- Yes, it's my rules that keep us alive.

514
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:34,070
If you want to stay in this house,
on this team, you'll abide by them.

515
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:36,780
This is no partnership.

516
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:38,530
You're never going to trust me!

517
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:47,080
Dear brother Wilfred...

518
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:51,540
...I have tried
every address I know for you.

519
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:54,210
I'm just praying this reaches you.

520
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:56,550
We have very little time.

521
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:15,610
Batman monopolized the evening news.

522
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:20,490
Congratulations on your
apprehension of Mr. Freeze.

523
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:22,240
Thanks.
Thank you.

524
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:27,410
Is there something wrong, sir?

525
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:32,210
Am I pig-headed?

526
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,420
Is it always...

527
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:38,590
...my way or the highway?

528
00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:40,720
Why, yes.
Actually.

529
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:45,640
Death and chance stole your parents...

530
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:47,930
...but rather than become a victim...

531
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:52,100
...you have done everything
in your power to controI the fates.

532
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:54,730
For what is Batman...

533
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:59,650
...if not an effort to master the chaos
that sweeps our world?

534
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:02,490
An attempt to controI...

535
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:04,360
...death itself?

536
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:25,760
But I can't, can I?

537
00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:29,220
None of us can.

538
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:57,540
Sorry. So sorry!

539
00:53:57,790 --> 00:53:59,210
Teach you that at Oxbridge?

540
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:03,760
Just a few judo lessons.
You know, London's kind of rough.

541
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:06,510
I suppose you had
a minor in motorbikes also?

542
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:10,560
Couldn't resist.

543
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,100
It's just so beautifuI.

544
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:15,890
I just took it out for a spin.
I'll clean it tomorrow.

545
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:17,230
All right?

546
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,610
Sorry.

547
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:21,150
Sorry.
Good night.

548
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:08,740
Drag him into the cold beam.

549
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:12,530
Welcome home, Frost Face.

550
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:15,750
You're the common cold,
and we are the cure.

551
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:20,630
Allow me to break the ice.

552
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,050
My name is Freeze.

553
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:25,090
Learn it well...

554
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:28,180
...for it's the chilling sound
of your doom.

555
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:44,520
All right, Freezie, you can't live
outside the cold zone.

556
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:57,830
Look at him stew.

557
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,330
Get used to it.

558
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:04,420
You're going to be here a very long...

559
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:06,380
...long time.

560
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,340
Sadly...

561
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:11,930
...you will not live to see it.

562
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:27,400
Batface and Birdbrain turned out
to be much more resistant...

563
00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:29,950
...to my love dust
than expected.

564
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:34,160
No matter. Next time
I'll just give them a stronger dose.

565
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:37,450
They'll literally be dying for me.

566
00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:40,620
"Turkish baths. "

567
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:42,750
This looks promising.

568
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:11,900
A fixer-upper.

569
00:57:12,570 --> 00:57:14,660
But with a certain homey charm.

570
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:17,660
A minus!

571
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:19,700
Current tenants.

572
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:22,830
Hello, my little pretty, pretty, pretty.

573
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,790
Hello, yourself.

574
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:27,000
You look good enough to eat.

575
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:29,500
That I am.

576
00:57:30,010 --> 00:57:32,880
Come and get me,
if you can.

577
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,350
With pleasure.

578
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:59,330
Let's redecorate.

579
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:11,760
I've always hankered
for something on the water.

580
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:22,220
What is this floor?

581
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,610
It took God seven days...

582
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:33,940
...to create Paradise.

583
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:37,160
Let's see if I can do better.

584
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:45,620
Good babies.

585
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:47,170
Grow for mommy.

586
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:54,670
Bane, darling...

587
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:58,260
...I found a fellow
who strikes my fancy.

588
00:58:58,470 --> 00:59:00,640
A cooI customer, yes.

589
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:03,640
Icy demeanor...

590
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:05,730
...no question.

591
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:10,270
But I detect a certain ruthless charm
I may be able to use...

592
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,400
...to my advantage.

593
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,860
Honey, clean up this mess.

594
00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:18,030
We've got company coming.

595
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:19,820
Honey.

596
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:21,660
Company.

597
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:38,510
We've been going out
for over a year now, and...

598
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,140
Okay, here it goes.

599
00:59:41,350 --> 00:59:43,680
I want to spend my life with you.

600
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:48,690
I'm not the marrying kind.

601
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:51,770
There are things about me
you wouldn't understand.

602
00:59:52,310 --> 00:59:55,070
I know you're a dedicated bachelor.

603
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,780
You've had your wild nights.

604
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:58,950
"Wild" doesn't...

605
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:01,240
...quite cover it.

606
01:00:02,870 --> 01:00:05,330
You'll make someone
a good husband one day...

607
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,080
...but I can't wait forever.

608
01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:15,050
Look, I don't want to pressure you.
Because if I do...

609
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:17,260
...you'll just shut down.

610
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:19,260
I know the way you are.

611
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,640
Think about it.

612
01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:25,060
Just promise me you'll think about it.

613
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:26,810
Okay?

614
01:00:28,350 --> 01:00:30,100
You don't have to answer now.

615
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:31,560
Just...

616
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:33,060
...think it over.

617
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:35,110
Here's food for thought.

618
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,210
Who's Ivy?

619
01:00:57,550 --> 01:00:59,340
You just called me "Ivy. "

620
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:00,920
Who's Ivy?

621
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:03,510
I wish I knew.

622
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:08,100
Enhance detaiI, 14 to 19.

623
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:15,020
Who are you?

624
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:30,160
Gotcha!

625
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:19,840
Banker, how much coin to play?

626
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,130
21/2.

627
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:24,220
You're the chick who won
the tunneI run 2 nights ago!

628
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:25,470
That'd be me.

629
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:28,010
That was kid stuff, sweetheart.

630
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:31,140
Why don't you take your tricycle
and run home?

631
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:33,930
- Want a side bet?
- How much?

632
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:35,850
- How much you got?
- How much you got?

633
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:39,270
All right, let's race! Come on!

634
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:50,530
Just make sure the guys are ready
at the end of the bridge.

635
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:53,040
You got it, Spike!

636
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,270
Out of my way, losers!

637
01:04:05,570 --> 01:04:06,820
Nice try, girlie!

638
01:04:07,030 --> 01:04:08,280
You're next!

639
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:11,780
Excuse me!

640
01:04:15,370 --> 01:04:16,870
Look out, baby!

641
01:04:35,850 --> 01:04:38,060
Not bad, for a chick!

642
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:12,380
Now!

643
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:28,400
End of the line, sweetheart!

644
01:05:54,890 --> 01:05:56,470
So this is where you hang out.

645
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:02,310
How long you been racing?

646
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:04,520
Since my parents died.

647
01:06:04,690 --> 01:06:08,690
I guess all the speed and danger
helped take me out of myself.

648
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:10,650
Made the pain go away.

649
01:06:11,230 --> 01:06:12,860
You wouldn't understand.

650
01:06:13,070 --> 01:06:14,530
You'd be surprised.

651
01:06:14,910 --> 01:06:19,530
Street racing isn't exactly
an acceptable major at Oxbridge so...

652
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:21,200
...they kicked me out.

653
01:06:21,450 --> 01:06:25,120
But I've already won the money I need
to do what I've always dreamed.

654
01:06:25,330 --> 01:06:27,420
Don't say you want to join the circus.

655
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:32,510
Alfred has supported me my whole life
and I'm going to pay him back.

656
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:36,090
I'll take him away
from this dismaI life of servitude.

657
01:06:36,890 --> 01:06:38,390
What are you talking about?

658
01:06:38,550 --> 01:06:41,350
Listen, this whole
master-servant thing...

659
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:42,930
...it's really ridiculous.

660
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:45,390
Alfred is a sweet, noble man...

661
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:49,110
...and he's subjugated all his life
and dreams to someone else.

662
01:06:49,310 --> 01:06:51,270
Alfred and Bruce are like family.

663
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,570
Paying someone to prepare your meals...

664
01:06:54,740 --> 01:06:57,660
...do laundry, clean dishes,
you call that family?

665
01:06:57,910 --> 01:06:59,280
Alfred's happy.

666
01:06:59,570 --> 01:07:00,950
Happy?

667
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:04,000
You honestly don't know, do you?

668
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,710
How he's hiding the pain all the time.

669
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:08,790
Alfred's sick.

670
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:14,300
Alfred's not sick.

671
01:07:14,590 --> 01:07:15,970
He's dying.

672
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:19,890
Dying?

673
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:24,770
Why didn't he tell us?

674
01:07:25,310 --> 01:07:28,020
You know Alfred,
he'd never say anything.

675
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:35,610
But I can tell.

676
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:42,410
I can't believe it.

677
01:07:43,790 --> 01:07:44,790
I know.

678
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:35,250
Icehead, you got a visitor.

679
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:38,220
Your sister is here to see you.

680
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:39,630
Sister?

681
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:45,680
Brother, dear...

682
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:48,560
...I heard you were blue.

683
01:08:50,850 --> 01:08:53,230
Don't mind us, ma'am.

684
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:55,400
You can speak freely.

685
01:08:58,070 --> 01:09:00,570
I don't mind you at all.

686
01:09:04,530 --> 01:09:05,780
Men...

687
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:08,870
...the most absurd of God's creatures.

688
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:10,410
We give you life...

689
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:14,500
...and we can take it away
just as easily.

690
01:09:14,670 --> 01:09:16,920
- Right!
- Whatever.

691
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:20,840
I really am to die for.

692
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:50,290
Impressive!

693
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:54,710
Well, I, my most
unabominable snowman...

694
01:09:55,290 --> 01:09:57,670
...have been impressed by you.

695
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:59,300
In fact...

696
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:01,920
...I propose a pairing.

697
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:14,140
I've come to set you free.

698
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:16,940
An enticing offer...

699
01:10:17,610 --> 01:10:18,610
...but...

700
01:10:18,770 --> 01:10:20,940
...what does the lady want in return?

701
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:27,160
Let's cooI it for now.
I've got someone I want you to meet.

702
01:10:34,620 --> 01:10:36,920
His name is Bane.

703
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:40,630
A laundry service that delivers! Wow!

704
01:10:45,630 --> 01:10:48,510
What are you,
about a 50, big and tall?

705
01:10:48,930 --> 01:10:52,810
No, I always go a size smaller.
Makes me look slimmer.

706
01:10:58,400 --> 01:10:59,900
I'm running on empty.

707
01:11:00,150 --> 01:11:01,650
I need the diamonds.

708
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:03,990
I'll help you grab your rocks.

709
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:08,450
Bane...

710
01:11:08,660 --> 01:11:09,910
...dear...

711
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:11,700
...an exit, please.

712
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:19,290
Reinforced steeI.

713
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:20,630
Not good.

714
01:11:31,510 --> 01:11:33,850
Always winterize your pipes.

715
01:11:49,990 --> 01:11:53,950
While I get my diamonds,
you and "meatloaf" retrieve my wife.

716
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:56,250
You never mentioned a wife!

717
01:11:56,410 --> 01:11:57,410
Come on.

718
01:11:57,580 --> 01:11:59,500
I hope Mr. Bane can swim.

719
01:12:17,930 --> 01:12:19,940
Alfred, are you well?

720
01:12:20,270 --> 01:12:22,770
As well as can be expected, sir.

721
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:26,440
My friend, I know you're sick.

722
01:12:26,650 --> 01:12:28,450
I can get you the best doctors.

723
01:12:28,650 --> 01:12:31,320
I have seen the best doctors.

724
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:36,450
A gentleman does not discuss
his ailments. It is not civilized.

725
01:12:36,910 --> 01:12:41,120
I hope that I have taught you
at least that much, Master Bruce.

726
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:45,920
Have you ever...

727
01:12:46,130 --> 01:12:48,630
...regretted your life working here?

728
01:12:49,470 --> 01:12:50,880
Looking after heroes?

729
01:12:51,090 --> 01:12:52,390
No, sir.

730
01:12:53,350 --> 01:12:57,470
My only regret is that I was never
able to be out there with you.

731
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:03,400
Not all the heroes wear masks.

732
01:13:07,610 --> 01:13:08,860
Freeze has escaped!

733
01:13:22,670 --> 01:13:25,250
We got this off
the Arkham surveillance camera.

734
01:13:28,510 --> 01:13:29,840
Poison Ivy.

735
01:13:31,510 --> 01:13:32,510
2 nights ago...

736
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:36,760
...Gotham Airport, these two arrive
by charter from South America.

737
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:40,100
They put 10 security guards
in the hospitaI...

738
01:13:40,350 --> 01:13:44,860
...left a businessman dead from
organic poisoning, stole his limousine.

739
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:48,360
This is definitely the same pair
that sprang Freeze.

740
01:13:49,570 --> 01:13:50,990
Excuse me, gentlemen.

741
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:54,360
Poison Ivy...
why would she help Freeze?

742
01:13:54,570 --> 01:13:56,120
She's definitely eviI.

743
01:13:56,370 --> 01:13:59,120
She was all I could think about,
like I was in love-

744
01:13:59,370 --> 01:14:01,500
I know, then the feeling vanished.

745
01:14:01,710 --> 01:14:04,000
I can't believe
we fought over a bad guy.

746
01:14:04,210 --> 01:14:06,540
Bad, yes. Guy, no.

747
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:08,500
Well, I'm totally over her.

748
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:10,420
Me too. Definitely.

749
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:13,550
- Great stems, though.
- Buds too.

750
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:14,720
Those are nice.

751
01:14:14,890 --> 01:14:16,010
Here we go.

752
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:23,350
It's Nora Fries.

753
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:24,900
She's still alive.

754
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:43,750
He adapted his freezing technology
to reverse the disease.

755
01:14:43,910 --> 01:14:46,580
He found a cure for the disease
in some stages.

756
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:48,590
There she is.

757
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:52,210
Get the diamonds.
I'll rescue the bride.

758
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:54,590
We'll meet back at my place.

759
01:14:55,430 --> 01:14:58,760
In my weakened condition,
I'm no match for the Bat and Bird.

760
01:14:58,930 --> 01:15:01,470
You leave those boys to me.

761
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:02,930
Go!

762
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:08,190
- Can he save her?
- Her case is too advanced.

763
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:09,770
But maybe someday...

764
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:11,610
...with more research...

765
01:15:18,070 --> 01:15:19,450
Poison Ivy.

766
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:31,710
I hate uninvited guests.

767
01:15:38,930 --> 01:15:40,510
My lungs are freezing!

768
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:54,440
Chilled...

769
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:55,820
...to perfection.

770
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:04,040
No beauty.

771
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,540
Just the beast.

772
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:30,560
Hey, there, pretty birdie.

773
01:16:30,770 --> 01:16:32,690
Give yourself up. If you surrender-

774
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:34,020
To you?

775
01:16:36,030 --> 01:16:38,030
Polly want a kiss?

776
01:16:50,370 --> 01:16:54,750
There's something about
an anatomically correct...

777
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:59,050
...rubber suit
that puts fire in a girI's lips.

778
01:17:02,390 --> 01:17:05,890
Why are all the gorgeous ones
homicidaI maniacs? Is it me?

779
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:07,020
Enough...

780
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:08,810
...sweet talk.

781
01:17:11,730 --> 01:17:15,070
First you'll tell me where Freeze is,
then you're going to jaiI.

782
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:20,860
I'm a lover, not a fighter.

783
01:17:21,070 --> 01:17:24,410
That's why every Poison Ivy
Action Figure comes with him!

784
01:17:27,910 --> 01:17:30,790
Try not to make a mess when you die.

785
01:18:01,780 --> 01:18:02,950
Hold it right there!

786
01:18:24,630 --> 01:18:25,970
Stop!

787
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:31,930
Living in the shadow
of the big, bad Bat.

788
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:34,020
You don't need him.

789
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:36,940
You're the star.

790
01:18:37,150 --> 01:18:38,940
I can see it now:

791
01:18:39,150 --> 01:18:43,320
Your own big, bright signaI in the sky.

792
01:18:44,150 --> 01:18:46,160
Let me guide you.

793
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:56,670
Let me kiss you.

794
01:18:56,830 --> 01:18:58,340
Stop! Don't kiss her.

795
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,840
The victim at the airport,
toxins introduced orally.

796
01:19:02,050 --> 01:19:04,680
- What are you saying?
- Why does she want to kiss us?

797
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:07,260
- I bet her lips are poisoned.
- Poisoned kiss?

798
01:19:07,470 --> 01:19:08,850
You have issues with women!

799
01:19:09,050 --> 01:19:11,470
You can't stand that
she'd kiss me and not you.

800
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:13,850
Something would be mine, not yours.

801
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:25,400
Exit, Bane.

802
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:27,320
Exit!

803
01:19:38,420 --> 01:19:40,880
Ivy's right. I don't need your help.

804
01:19:43,210 --> 01:19:44,880
I'm going solo!

805
01:19:47,510 --> 01:19:48,640
What happened?

806
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:50,510
How'd they get away?

807
01:20:07,950 --> 01:20:10,910
I've never been good with competition.

808
01:20:12,950 --> 01:20:16,080
Who needs a frigid wife anyway?

809
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:42,980
Make yourself right at home.

810
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:46,610
Where's my wife?

811
01:20:47,070 --> 01:20:50,110
There was nothing I could do.
Batman deactivated her.

812
01:20:50,570 --> 01:20:52,780
- She's dead.
- You lie!

813
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:19,180
I'm sorry.

814
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:24,360
Their bones will turn to ice!

815
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:29,190
Their blood will freeze in my hands!

816
01:21:30,030 --> 01:21:31,410
Kill them, of course.

817
01:21:31,610 --> 01:21:33,490
But why stop there?

818
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:36,950
Why should only
Batman and Robin die...

819
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:40,540
...while the society that created them
goes unpunished?

820
01:21:40,790 --> 01:21:42,460
Yes!

821
01:21:42,670 --> 01:21:44,840
If I must suffer...

822
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:47,960
...humanity will suffer with me!

823
01:21:48,170 --> 01:21:53,050
I shall repay them for sentencing me
to a life without human comfort.

824
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:57,060
I will blanket the city
in endless winter!

825
01:21:57,350 --> 01:21:58,520
First...

826
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:01,230
...Gotham.

827
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:03,900
And then...

828
01:22:04,350 --> 01:22:05,480
...the world!

829
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:08,690
Just what I had in mind.

830
01:22:09,990 --> 01:22:13,160
Everything dead on Earth except us.

831
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:14,870
A chance for...

832
01:22:15,070 --> 01:22:17,910
...Mother Nature to start again.

833
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:19,160
Behold...

834
01:22:19,370 --> 01:22:22,080
...the dawn of a new age.

835
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:28,710
My mutant plants have the strength
of the deadliest animals.

836
01:22:29,550 --> 01:22:33,930
Once you have frozen mankind,
these babies will overrun the globe.

837
01:22:34,930 --> 01:22:36,720
And we shall rule them.

838
01:22:38,390 --> 01:22:39,890
For we will be...

839
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:42,680
...the only two people
left in the world.

840
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:45,230
Yes.

841
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:46,900
Adam...

842
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:49,690
...and EviI.

843
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:53,360
You distract the Bat and Bird...

844
01:22:53,530 --> 01:22:55,070
...while I prepare...

845
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:56,620
...to freeze...

846
01:22:56,870 --> 01:22:58,280
...Gotham!

847
01:23:12,710 --> 01:23:15,880
It's Stage 1 of Macgregor's Syndrome.

848
01:23:16,430 --> 01:23:17,550
I'm sorry.

849
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:21,520
All we can do is
make him comfortable.

850
01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:25,390
Thank you, Doctor.

851
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:45,290
Macgregor's Syndrome is
what Fries' wife had.

852
01:23:45,830 --> 01:23:48,460
Alfred's condition is less severe.
Fries' research said...

853
01:23:48,710 --> 01:23:51,130
...he cured a case like it,
just didn't say how.

854
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:53,210
No one else is even close.

855
01:23:53,420 --> 01:23:57,050
I'm late for the dedication,
then I go after Freeze and Ivy alone.

856
01:23:57,260 --> 01:23:59,510
- Like hell you do.
- Don't push me right now.

857
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:02,970
Or what? No one can
capture Ivy but the big, bad Bat?

858
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:03,930
Right.

859
01:24:04,470 --> 01:24:05,980
You want her for yourself.

860
01:24:06,180 --> 01:24:09,810
I want her so badly, I can taste it.
That's the whole point.

861
01:24:10,650 --> 01:24:15,070
She's done something to us.
She has us fighting over her somehow.

862
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:18,700
I know she loves me and not you,
and it's driving you crazy.

863
01:24:18,950 --> 01:24:21,330
That's why you
stopped us from kissing.

864
01:24:21,490 --> 01:24:24,200
- You're not thinking straight.
- But I am.

865
01:24:25,290 --> 01:24:27,210
For the first time in a long time.

866
01:24:27,460 --> 01:24:29,920
I want a Robin signaI
in the sky, all right?

867
01:24:30,130 --> 01:24:32,090
I'm tired of living
in your shadow.

868
01:24:32,290 --> 01:24:33,500
All that ends now.

869
01:24:38,590 --> 01:24:40,390
I'm sorry, Uncle.

870
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:43,390
I was too late.

871
01:24:54,230 --> 01:24:56,940
You must do something for me.

872
01:24:59,070 --> 01:25:01,030
Find my brother, Wilfred...

873
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:03,740
...your uncle,
wherever he is, and give him...

874
01:25:03,990 --> 01:25:05,040
...this.

875
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:09,040
I have duties
that he must fulfill in my stead.

876
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:12,880
Only family can be trusted.

877
01:25:13,790 --> 01:25:15,000
What is it?

878
01:25:15,550 --> 01:25:18,970
It is a sacred trust of two good men...

879
01:25:19,170 --> 01:25:22,260
...whom I have the honor
of calling "son. "

880
01:25:25,180 --> 01:25:26,470
Take it to Wilfred...

881
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:28,270
...and I implore you...

882
01:25:29,180 --> 01:25:30,640
...never open it.

883
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:37,110
You look so like your mother.

884
01:25:40,650 --> 01:25:43,450
<i>Bonsoir, glamorous Gothamites.</i>

885
01:25:43,660 --> 01:25:45,580
<i>Everyone who's anyone...</i>

886
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:47,490
...has flocked to the observatory...

887
01:25:47,660 --> 01:25:51,830
...and tonight's star-studded
dedication of the new telescope.

888
01:25:56,670 --> 01:26:00,130
And here's the man
of the hour himself...

889
01:26:00,380 --> 01:26:02,380
...Bruce Wayne.

890
01:26:05,550 --> 01:26:06,760
Excuse me.

891
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:10,600
Commissioner.

892
01:26:10,770 --> 01:26:12,270
- How are you?
- Good. You know Julie?

893
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:13,730
How are you?

894
01:26:13,940 --> 01:26:15,230
Good to see you.

895
01:26:17,610 --> 01:26:18,780
Young man.

896
01:26:20,570 --> 01:26:22,240
Lovely to see you again.

897
01:26:27,530 --> 01:26:28,700
Thank you.

898
01:26:29,330 --> 01:26:30,950
Commissioner Gordon...

899
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:35,210
...I've always wondered...

900
01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:39,170
...where does that big,
old Batlight come from?

901
01:26:45,090 --> 01:26:46,470
Why...

902
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:47,470
...it's...

903
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:49,810
...on top of Police Headquarters.

904
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:51,930
I'd just...

905
01:26:52,180 --> 01:26:53,770
...love to see it.

906
01:26:53,980 --> 01:26:56,480
But you probably don't have access.

907
01:26:56,650 --> 01:26:57,900
Why, dear lady...

908
01:26:58,980 --> 01:27:01,400
...I am the police commissioner.

909
01:27:01,610 --> 01:27:04,570
I have the keys
right here in my pocket.

910
01:27:04,740 --> 01:27:06,280
Would you like to see it?

911
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:27,840
Who are you, dear lady?

912
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:33,600
On second thought,
you're way too old for me.

913
01:27:33,770 --> 01:27:35,480
No, I'm not.

914
01:27:36,650 --> 01:27:38,110
Please...

915
01:27:38,310 --> 01:27:39,940
...come back.

916
01:27:46,660 --> 01:27:48,700
What are you doing? Come on.

917
01:27:49,490 --> 01:27:51,870
Show me how the satellites work.

918
01:28:05,340 --> 01:28:06,380
First...

919
01:28:06,590 --> 01:28:09,720
...I will turn Gotham into
an icy graveyard...

920
01:28:09,890 --> 01:28:10,760
...then...

921
01:28:10,970 --> 01:28:13,930
...I will pull Batman's heart
from his body...

922
01:28:14,180 --> 01:28:16,810
...and feeI it freeze in my hands.

923
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:22,270
Revenge!

924
01:28:23,730 --> 01:28:25,320
Quickly, Bane.

925
01:28:25,530 --> 01:28:26,740
Quickly now.

926
01:28:40,210 --> 01:28:42,290
Let there be light.

927
01:28:48,630 --> 01:28:51,010
Only family can be trusted?

928
01:28:53,970 --> 01:28:55,100
I'm family.

I spend my entire life
trying to beat back death.

932
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:41,650
Everything I've done,
everything I'm...

933
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:44,310
...capable of doing...

934
01:29:47,780 --> 01:29:49,740
But I can't save you.

935
01:29:50,900 --> 01:29:53,910
There's no defeat in death...

936
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:56,160
...Master Bruce.

937
01:29:57,620 --> 01:30:00,580
Victory comes in defending...

938
01:30:00,790 --> 01:30:03,000
...what we know is right...

939
01:30:03,460 --> 01:30:05,920
...while we still live.

940
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:36,740
I love you, old man.

941
01:30:40,290 --> 01:30:43,080

<i>Access allowed.</i>

947
01:32:13,510 --> 01:32:16,630
The combined power of
the telescope's reflecting crystals...

948
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:17,880
...will complete...

949
01:32:18,050 --> 01:32:19,760
...my freezing engine.

950
01:32:23,470 --> 01:32:26,270
No matter
what they tell you, Mr. Bane...

951
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:29,150
...it is the size of
your gun that counts.

952
01:32:38,860 --> 01:32:39,910
Where are you going?

953
01:32:40,070 --> 01:32:43,040
It's not a Batlight, it's a Robin signaI.
Ivy's calling me.

954
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:44,410
Her name's Pamela Isley.

955
01:32:44,580 --> 01:32:47,410
She must've stolen Gordon's keys
and changed the signaI.

956
01:32:47,580 --> 01:32:49,000
She did it for me, for love.

957
01:32:49,170 --> 01:32:51,040
She infected us with pheromones.

958
01:32:51,250 --> 01:32:53,590
I'm under some kind of magic spell?

959
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:54,960
She wants to kill you.

960
01:32:55,260 --> 01:32:57,840
You'd say anything to keep her
away from me.

961
01:32:58,010 --> 01:32:59,590
To keep her for yourself.

962
01:33:00,090 --> 01:33:02,760
You said being a team
means trusting your partner.

963
01:33:02,970 --> 01:33:07,480
Sometimes, counting on someone
else is the only way to win. Remember?

964
01:33:08,020 --> 01:33:11,810
You weren't talking about partners,
but about being a family.

965
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:13,940
So I'm asking you...

966
01:33:14,110 --> 01:33:15,780
...friend, partner...

967
01:33:16,030 --> 01:33:17,030
...brother...

968
01:33:18,030 --> 01:33:19,910
...will you trust me now?

969
01:33:32,290 --> 01:33:35,000
- All the crystals are in place.
- Thank you.

970
01:33:44,510 --> 01:33:45,760
Hi!

971
01:33:45,970 --> 01:33:47,810
I'm sorry about the door.

972
01:33:48,730 --> 01:33:49,980
Is the party over?

973
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:54,980
Who is this nutball?

974
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:36,150
If revenge...

975
01:34:36,360 --> 01:34:38,730
...is a dish best served cold...

976
01:34:39,190 --> 01:34:41,740
...then put on your Sunday finest.

977
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:43,410
It's time...

978
01:34:43,740 --> 01:34:45,410
...to feast!

979
01:34:56,920 --> 01:34:58,090
Tonight...

980
01:34:58,380 --> 01:35:01,260

<i>I expected you might find

<i>...and created a virtual simulation.</i>

<i>I anticipated you would...</i>

<i>...and took the liberty

01:37:40,290 --> 01:37:43,000
Is your thumb the
only part of you that's green?

995
01:37:43,420 --> 01:37:46,300
You will just have to find out.

996
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:48,800
I want us to be together, but...

997
01:37:48,970 --> 01:37:51,590
...you must be serious
about turning over a new leaf.

998
01:37:53,430 --> 01:37:54,300
I need a sign...

999
01:37:55,310 --> 01:37:57,430
How about "Slippery when wet. "

1000
01:37:57,600 --> 01:37:58,810
...of trust.

1001
01:37:59,140 --> 01:38:00,730
Tell me your plan.

1002
01:38:00,940 --> 01:38:02,440
Kiss me and I'll tell you.

1003
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:05,320
Tell me and I'll kiss you.

1004
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:11,530
Freeze has taken the new telescope
and turned it into a giant freezing gun.

1005
01:38:11,860 --> 01:38:14,450
He's about to turn Gotham
into an ice cube.

1006
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:17,200
I've got to stop him.

1007
01:38:17,370 --> 01:38:18,540
One kiss...

1008
01:38:18,790 --> 01:38:19,830
...my love.

1009
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,420
For luck.

1010
01:38:35,430 --> 01:38:37,260
Bad luck, I'm afraid.

1011
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:40,100
Time to die, little Robin.

1012
01:38:43,310 --> 01:38:45,610
I hate to disappoint you, but...

1013
01:38:49,650 --> 01:38:52,360
...rubber lips are immune to
your charms.

1014
01:38:59,580 --> 01:39:00,870
See you!

1015
01:39:02,830 --> 01:39:05,580
You're not the only one
who can set a trap, Venus.

1016
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:06,960
Sorry...

1017
01:39:07,170 --> 01:39:09,800
...my vines have a crush on you.

1018
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:18,890
Got to go.

1019
01:39:19,060 --> 01:39:22,520
So many people to kill,
so little time.

1020
01:39:32,030 --> 01:39:33,700
You're about to become compost.

1021
01:39:41,410 --> 01:39:44,080
Using feminine wiles
to get what you want?

1022
01:39:44,250 --> 01:39:45,290
Trading on your looks?

1023
01:39:45,460 --> 01:39:46,380
Read a book.

1024
01:39:46,540 --> 01:39:49,000
That passive-aggressive
number went out long ago.

1025
01:39:49,210 --> 01:39:51,250
You give women a bad name.

1026
01:40:11,530 --> 01:40:15,400
As I told Lady Fries,
when I pulled her plug...

1027
01:40:15,950 --> 01:40:17,660
...this is a one-woman show.

1028
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:19,450
I don't think so.

1029
01:40:41,180 --> 01:40:42,220
Curses!

1030
01:40:58,530 --> 01:41:00,160
Freeze is going to ice the city.

1031
01:41:00,370 --> 01:41:01,530
I know.

1032
01:41:01,740 --> 01:41:02,700
And you are?

1033
01:41:02,950 --> 01:41:03,990
BatgirI.

1034
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:07,750
That's not P.C. What about
Batperson or Batwoman?

1035
01:41:08,120 --> 01:41:11,420
Bruce, it's me, Barbara.
I found the Batcave.

1036
01:41:11,630 --> 01:41:13,090
We must change the locks.

1037
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:15,460
- She knows who we are.
- We must kill her.

1038
01:41:15,630 --> 01:41:17,970
Later. We have work to do.

1039
01:41:37,190 --> 01:41:40,200
Let's kick some ice.

1040
01:43:08,240 --> 01:43:10,500
We have 11 minutes
to thaw the city.

1041
01:43:37,980 --> 01:43:39,150
Gotcha!

1042
01:43:40,150 --> 01:43:41,150
Now!

1043
01:43:50,790 --> 01:43:52,120
Shield.

1044
01:44:14,140 --> 01:44:15,350
I'll finish off the city.

1045
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:17,810
You kill the kids, but...

1046
01:44:17,980 --> 01:44:20,320
...leave me the Bat.

1047
01:44:40,540 --> 01:44:41,840
No sign of the snowman.

1048
01:44:42,590 --> 01:44:44,380
Maybe he melted.

1049
01:44:44,590 --> 01:44:46,720
No, he's just hibernating.

1050
01:45:04,570 --> 01:45:05,690
These heaters will thaw them.

1051
01:45:13,740 --> 01:45:15,870
I hope you've got
10 million more of those toys.

1052
01:45:16,250 --> 01:45:18,420
8 minutes
and they're ice cubes forever.

1053
01:45:18,580 --> 01:45:20,250
Sunlight could reverse
the freezing process.

1054
01:45:20,420 --> 01:45:21,880
Sunrise isn't for 5 hours.

1055
01:45:22,040 --> 01:45:22,590
Here.

1056
01:45:22,750 --> 01:45:24,170
It's morning in the Congo.

1057
01:45:24,380 --> 01:45:25,420
We'll relay sunlight-

1058
01:45:25,590 --> 01:45:26,840
From below the equator-

1059
01:45:27,050 --> 01:45:29,720
It'll take the satellites
a minute to realign, but...

1060
01:45:30,260 --> 01:45:30,890
Damn!

1061
01:45:31,050 --> 01:45:32,640
Damn?
Damn's not good.

1062
01:45:32,890 --> 01:45:35,520
Those targeting mirrors are frozen.

1063
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:37,270
I realign, you thaw the mirrors.

1064
01:46:03,540 --> 01:46:04,960
Tonight's forecast:

1065
01:46:05,210 --> 01:46:07,090
A freeze is coming.

1066
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:22,900
Bye-bye.

1067
01:46:35,870 --> 01:46:37,120
I got you!

1068
01:46:47,750 --> 01:46:49,840
No.
I got you.

1069
01:47:02,850 --> 01:47:04,650
It's one of those days!

1070
01:47:58,830 --> 01:48:00,410
Dirty fighter!

1071
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:16,760
The tube!

1072
01:48:31,610 --> 01:48:32,530
Yay, Batman!

1073
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:47,670
Hey, Freeze.

1074
01:48:47,870 --> 01:48:48,880
The heat is on.

1075
01:49:02,220 --> 01:49:04,060
You all right down there?

1076
01:49:05,640 --> 01:49:06,640
Here goes.

1077
01:49:35,670 --> 01:49:36,840
Hang on.

1078
01:49:52,730 --> 01:49:53,690
You're doing it!

1079
01:49:54,780 --> 01:49:56,690
You've lost, Freeze.

1080
01:49:57,240 --> 01:49:58,240
I think not.

1081
01:49:59,610 --> 01:50:01,240
Bombs away, Batman.

1082
01:50:25,640 --> 01:50:28,060
Freeze in hell, Batman!

1083
01:50:56,040 --> 01:50:57,670
What should we do now?

1084
01:50:57,880 --> 01:50:58,760
Pray.

1085
01:51:04,590 --> 01:51:06,100
Hang on!

1086
01:51:08,930 --> 01:51:10,850
Grab on to my belt!

1087
01:51:29,540 --> 01:51:31,160
Thank you, Batman!

1088
01:51:36,420 --> 01:51:37,420
Need a ride?

1089
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:51,100
- Most of Gotham's still frozen.
- It's midnight.

1090
01:51:51,430 --> 01:51:54,060
Telescope's gone.
There's no way to thaw the city.

1091
01:51:54,230 --> 01:51:57,270
The satellites could do it,
but it'd take a computer genius.

1092
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:58,440
I'm on it.

1093
01:51:59,150 --> 01:52:00,400
No, I'm on it.

1094
01:52:06,370 --> 01:52:07,780
Have to do it upside down.

1095
01:52:07,990 --> 01:52:10,580
Men!
Everything the hard way.

1096
01:52:13,160 --> 01:52:15,170
You're pretty good at this, little girI.

1097
01:52:16,830 --> 01:52:19,290
Watch and learn, little boy.

1098
01:53:26,280 --> 01:53:28,240
They say it'll be a beautifuI day.

1099
01:53:36,580 --> 01:53:39,580
I'm taking you back
to Arkham Asylum.

1100
01:53:40,790 --> 01:53:42,250
Go on.

1101
01:53:43,130 --> 01:53:44,460
Kill me too.

1102
01:53:44,710 --> 01:53:46,300
Just as you killed my wife.

1103
01:53:46,510 --> 01:53:48,130
I didn't kill your wife.

1104
01:53:53,220 --> 01:53:57,230
<i>As I told Lady Fries
when I pulled her plug...</i>

1105
01:53:57,520 --> 01:53:59,900
<i>...this is a one-woman show.</i>

1106
01:54:05,610 --> 01:54:08,150
But she's not dead.

1107
01:54:08,280 --> 01:54:10,240
We found her,
restored her.

1108
01:54:10,780 --> 01:54:12,990
She's still frozen alive...

1109
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:15,080
...waiting for you to find a cure.

1110
01:54:16,290 --> 01:54:18,040
She lives?

1111
01:54:20,290 --> 01:54:23,630
But vengeance isn't power.
Anyone can take a life.

1112
01:54:24,170 --> 01:54:25,800
But to give life...

1113
01:54:26,250 --> 01:54:29,130
...that's true power.
A power you once had.

1114
01:54:30,300 --> 01:54:32,180
She's alive.

1115
01:54:37,850 --> 01:54:39,480
So I'm asking you.

1116
01:54:40,480 --> 01:54:42,100
Victor Fries...

1117
01:54:42,940 --> 01:54:44,860
...help me save another life.

1118
01:54:45,270 --> 01:54:48,280
Show me how to cure
Macgregor's Syndrome Stage 1.

1119
01:54:48,780 --> 01:54:52,570
And maybe you can also save the life
of the man your wife once loved.

1120
01:54:53,490 --> 01:54:55,580
He's still inside you, Victor.

1121
01:54:56,580 --> 01:54:57,660
Buried...

1122
01:54:57,950 --> 01:55:00,040
...deep beneath the snow.

1123
01:55:02,670 --> 01:55:04,330
Will you help me...

1124
01:55:05,880 --> 01:55:06,500
...Doctor?

1125
01:55:31,700 --> 01:55:33,700
Take 2 of these...

1126
01:55:34,990 --> 01:55:36,910
...and call me in the morning.

1127
01:55:47,460 --> 01:55:50,130
I'll have your wife
moved to the lab at Arkham.

1128
01:55:50,340 --> 01:55:52,720
You'll be able to continue
your research there.

1129
01:56:16,370 --> 01:56:18,530
All we can do now is wait...

1130
01:56:19,370 --> 01:56:21,200
...and hope.

1131
01:56:47,440 --> 01:56:49,270
He loves me.

1132
01:56:50,770 --> 01:56:52,610
He loves me not.

1133
01:56:54,950 --> 01:56:56,570
He loves me.

1134
01:56:58,450 --> 01:56:59,570
Not!

1135
01:57:01,450 --> 01:57:02,950
Surprise.

1136
01:57:03,160 --> 01:57:05,160
I'm your new cellmate.

1137
01:57:07,540 --> 01:57:10,750
And I've come
to make your life a living hell.

1138
01:57:11,750 --> 01:57:12,710
Prepare...

1139
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:14,760
...for a bitter harvest.

1140
01:57:18,470 --> 01:57:19,640
Winter...

1141
01:57:19,970 --> 01:57:21,970
...has come at last.

1142
01:58:07,600 --> 01:58:08,440
Are you...?

1143
01:58:08,600 --> 01:58:13,400
Rather disappointed at how poorly
I have taught you proper housekeeping.

1144
01:58:13,860 --> 01:58:15,690
And quite well, it seems!

1145
01:58:16,150 --> 01:58:17,530
Thanks to you, son.

1146
01:58:17,690 --> 01:58:19,950
Thanks to you all.

1147
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:21,740
Well done, Bruce.

1148
01:58:22,120 --> 01:58:24,200
You too.
Well done.

1149
01:58:25,540 --> 01:58:27,080
I got one question.

1150
01:58:27,410 --> 01:58:31,120
When we fell off the telescope,
why didn't you try and save us?

1151
01:58:31,330 --> 01:58:33,500
It's the first time I've fallen
and you weren't there.

1152
01:58:34,170 --> 01:58:35,460
I figured you could handle it.

1153
01:58:35,630 --> 01:58:40,340
You know, sometimes counting on
somebody else is the only way to win.

1154
01:58:43,220 --> 01:58:44,050
Excuse me.

1155
01:58:44,220 --> 01:58:46,680
I'm the one who
kicked Ivy's botanicaI butt.

1156
01:58:46,850 --> 01:58:47,980
Yeah, that was me.

1157
01:58:48,180 --> 01:58:49,520
I did it all by myself.

1158
01:58:49,770 --> 01:58:50,730
That was me.

1159
01:58:50,980 --> 01:58:53,230
You are going back to schooI.

1160
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:55,150
You'll never win this argument.

1161
01:59:00,240 --> 01:59:01,410
Partners?

1162
01:59:06,410 --> 01:59:07,240
Partners.

1163
01:59:16,750 --> 01:59:18,550
Partners.

1164
01:59:22,010 --> 01:59:24,090
We're going to need a bigger cave.
