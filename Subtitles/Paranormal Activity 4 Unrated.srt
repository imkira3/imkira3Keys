We did. We did.

00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,293
Did you get me some Kit Kats?

35

Not a scarecrow.

42
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:17,321

Ben, that's why
they're called "scare-crow."

48

-Hi, Mrs. Nelson.
-Put down the camera. Hello.

55
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,060
Don't even tell me

56
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,103
Oh, my gosh.

That is a lovely costume.

58
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:52,064

What's wrong with you?

66
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,751
Hey, now that she's gone,

67
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:12,835
Nope.

73
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,932
-Thanks.
-See you later.

74
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,934
lt's totally not a bank robber.

75
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,895
What's up, kitty?

76
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:42,865
Howdy, ma'am. What's up?

77

89
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:16,315
-Wait, this is the shortcut?
-Yeah.

137
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,106
Watch.

How much wood

-What's up, big dawg?

00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:12,908
When are your parents leaving?

163
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,326
l don't know. Soon.

164
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,245
l wanna get this party started!

165
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,997
lt's not a party, it's just, like, a kickback.

166
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,164
lt's a party.

167
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,084
-What is it called?
-lt's a palate expander.

168
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,378
No, l... l can't understand what you're...

169
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,505
A palate expander.

170
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,632
Okay, l heard "pirate."
What... Pirate what?

171
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:29,925
Palatal expander.

172
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,635
-Oh, my God.
-"Palate expander"?

173
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,845
-Yes. Yes.
-lt's a palate expander.

174
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,179
Why didn't you just say that
at the beginning?

175
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,639
That's what l've been saying all day!

176
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,308
-A puritto.
-A what?

177
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:38,976
"Puritto." lt's a pizza rolled up...

178
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,186
All right. Honey? We're off.

179
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,105
-All right. Yeah.
-You know the rules. Be good.

180
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:46,525
-Hey, illy.
-l love you, too.

181
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,861
Same goes for you, too. l own a gun.

182
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,863
-l promise.
-You own a gun?

183
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,240
-That's right. lt's a shotgun.
-Where's the gun?

184
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:54,325
Where is it?

185
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,243
-My dad owns a gun.
-"llly."

186
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,162
Don't lose.

187
00:08:58,663 --> 00:08:59,955
Damn it!

188
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:01,999
-l'm still ahead.
-l'm serving, l'm serving.

189
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,043
You girls are doing a fantastic job.

190
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,461
-Oh, my God. Get out of the way.
-You're wonderful.

191
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,296
-You're gonna block us.
-Ben, get out of the way! Ben!

192
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,382
-Such gross people.
-You're such a mother figure.

193
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:11,800
Why did we not have them
stay back and help?

194
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,636
-They're so gross.
-That was stupid.

195
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,137
-You're done?
-What?

196
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,263
You just done? Good to sit?

197
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:17,389
l didn't really ever start, personally.

198
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:18,807
All right, l'm taking a break, too.

199
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:21,977
Do you want to

200
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:23,729
come sit closer?

201
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,023
l just hate yelling, and l know that l'm...

202
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,107
You hate yelling?

203
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:29,652
-Okay.
-See? lsn't that much better?

204
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:30,819
lt's more comfortable.

205
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,988
This couch, just, in general,
is more comfortable.

206
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,156
No.

207
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,409
Ben!

208
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:38,994
ls that... ls it too much?

209
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,412
No.

210
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:42,414
-What do you want to do?
-l don't know.

211
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,250
lt's kind of hot in here.
We can go outside or something.

212
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,752
You could show me around.

213
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,671
Give me a little tour.

214
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:50,756
You want to go outside?

215
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,924
Yes!

216
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:58,013
l have hot blood and l need to
catch some... Catch some air.

217
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:01,016
Okay.

218
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,227
Back door open.

219
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,104
Here we are.

220
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,563
Can you see?

221
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:09,817
This is the playhouse,
otherwise known as my castle.

222
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,902
-That's awesome.
-That's where l reign.

223
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,780
You have a castle?
ls your crown up there?

224
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,115
That's awesome.

225
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,866
-You should get your crown.
-l have to be rescued in it.

226
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,119
-Can you come save me?
-What?

227
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:22,705
Yeah!

228
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,212
You know what? You know,
l actually found it, so...

229
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,505
-Yeah? Did you?
-Yeah, so...

230
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,923
And you're already on your way!

231
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:39,054
This is actually a lot dirtier
than l was expecting.

232
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,187
There's just shit everywhere.

233
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:48,313
What the...

234
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:51,024
Wow, dude!
Alex, there is a boy in your castle.

235
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:52,484
He's the kid from across the street.

236
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:55,654
-What are you doing here, man?
-Are you okay?

237
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:58,073
...take you home, okay?

238
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:07,833
What the fuck?

239
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,882
l'm gonna take him home, okay?
You can stay here.

240
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,344
What's your name?

241
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:21,305
Robbie.

242
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,017
Thanks for cock-blocking me.

243
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,396
His name's Robbie

244
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,233
And he Iives across the street

245
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:34,985
These are good facts.

246
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,447
And he comes into my tree house

247
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:39,990
At 10:00 at night

248
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,074
So what did she say?

249
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:45,788
His mom is single, and apparently
she's really busy and she works a lot,

250
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,123
so she's not really home,
so l guess he's kind of lonely.

251
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,125
At their old house,
he used to do the same thing

252
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,960
and go play in
the neighbor's playhouse.

253
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,045
What? ln the middle of the night?

254
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,421
Yeah, so he thought it was normal.

255
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:55,506
-l know!
-Go over there and...

256
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,715
-l know.
-Just... That's crazy.

257
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,512
Yeah, just, like, beyond the shirt.

258
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,514
Okay, no.

259
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:06,517
-Just like a quick boobie.
-What?

260
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,060
Just quick boobie.

261
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,646
Okay, l'm gonna go. This chat's done,

262
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,648
and l'm gonna go
make a snack downstairs.

263
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:13,941
No, no, no!

264
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:15,859
Take me with you.

265
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:17,820
Take you with me?

266
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,112
Yes, take me with you.

267
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,572
God, you're so needy!

268
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:23,158
Just be quiet. Everyone's asleep.

269
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,285
Why is it so dark?

270
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,496
'Cause everyone is sleeping.

271
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:31,124
So if I was Iike, "Yeah!",
am l waking them up?

272
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:33,794
l don't think my mom and dad
would want to go together.

273
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:34,962
At least you stay at home.

274
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:38,298
l have to go to Mexico. And that blows.

275
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,092
Mexico sounds really fun.

276
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,761
lt sucks, 'cause, literally,
l have to sleep in my grandpa's bed,

277
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,179
like, with my grandpa.

278
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,931
And he's, Iike, a massive farter.

279
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,349
Ben! Gross.

280
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:52,104
lt's, like, airy. l can feel
them brush up against my leg.

281
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,360
Are you all right?

282
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:02,906
Look.

283
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:06,076
Something's happening at
that kid Robbie's house.

284
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,369
Hey, Mom?

285
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:08,871
What's going on?

286
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,373
There is something definitely
going on over there.

287
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,626
What's going on?

288
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:16,128
-l got to go.
-Wait! No, no!

289
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,256
Look, he's coming!
He's coming! Come on!

290
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,382
-What?
-Come on!

291
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,134
Look at him.

292
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,511
Oh, my God, l love this kid.

293
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:27,055
The socks with the sandals
is my favorite part.

294
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:35,731
Front door open.

295
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,609
Hi, Robbie. How you doing?
Come on in. Come on in.

296
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:40,903
Wyatt? Want to come say hi to Robbie?

297
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:44,031
Come on.
Honey, come on. Come say hi.

298
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,242
Robbie, that's Wyatt. Come on.

299
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,748
Shake hands.

300
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,918
Have fun. Let me know
if you need anything.

301
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,921
-l love this kid.
-l know.

302
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,756
This kid is amazing.

303
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,674
-He shook his hand!
-l know.

304
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,052
He straight-up, "Hello." Shook his hand.

305
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:06,470
What happened to Robbie's mom?

306
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,013
lt's not good.
She's gonna be in the hospital

307
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,348
for, like, two or three days.

308
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:10,849
-Really?
-Yeah.

309
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,185
So he's just gonna stay with us?

310
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,937
Yeah. l don't know what else to do.

311
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,063
He doesn't have anywhere to go.

312
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,522
He doesn't have any relatives?

313
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,316
No, he doesn't have anybody.

314
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,403
Do you even know his mom, though?

315
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,781
Like, it's really nice,
but we don't even know them.

316
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,451
My pillow.

317
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,497
Okay. That's cute.

318
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,458
Shipshooba.

319
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:37,709
Cool.

320
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,795
-Careful with that! lt's 1 00 years old.
-Shipshooba.

321
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:40,879
Freaky.

322
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,215
Toothbrush. That's good. You need that.

323
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,176
And special fork.

324
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,055
You know, we have forks here, Robbie.

325
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,139
Careful.

326
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,141
ls this 1 00 years old, too?

327
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:56,812
Yeah. That is
a very expensive fork, too.

328
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,231
What does it do that's so special?

329
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,692
lt tells the future.

330
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,569
Be in my room.

331
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:06,655
Bye!

332
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,323
-How's Robbie doing?
-l think he's fine. l mean...

333
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,992
-Are they getting along?
-He's a little weird.

334
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,243
l know. l know, honey.

335
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,078
But after what happened
last night to his mom...

336
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,913
-Good night, sweetheart.
-Okay, good night.

337
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:19,251
lf it helps at all,
my parents fight constantly.

338
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,169
Like aII the time.

339
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:23,755
lt's different.

340
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,757
My parents just...

341
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,261
They don't fight, they just
act like everything's okay.

342
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,680
-WeII...
-You know?

343
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,516
How bad is it? Do you think
they're gonna get a divorce?

344
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:37,853
No.

345
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:39,938
l don't know.

346
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,858
l think they're gonna try
and hold it together for Wyatt.

347
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,779
Honestly, they're probably
just going through a phase.

348
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,532
'Cause my parents go through
phases all the time where they're, like...

349
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,908
They'll like each other for three months

350
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,285
-and then they'll hate each other.
-No, they just...

351
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,369
They don't even look at each other.

352
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,204
Like, l can't remember
the last time they kissed.

353
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,289
Back door open.

354
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,624
l'm sure it's just a phase.
You know what I mean?

355
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:00,959
-l'll be right back.
-They're totally gonna get...

356
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:03,086
Wait! Where are you going?

357
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,455
AIex?

358
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,249
What are you doing?

359
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,759
Odd Robbie strikes again!

360
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,135
Fuck! Oh, my God!

361
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,970
He was just standing down
in the kitchen

362
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:56,264
right at the open door, just staring at it.

363
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:57,933
He was just... What a weirdo.
lt's, like, midnight.

364
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,059
-What is he doing...
-Robbie was?

365
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,103
...in my kitchen
with the door open? Like...

366
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,521
He's such a creepy kid.

367
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:03,855
You know what? Wait.

368
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,191
Okay. Before l do this,
l just want you to know

369
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,527
that this is something
that my computer does.

370
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:11,113
So when l show you this,
don't, like, freak out or anything.

371
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,239
'Cause l didn't do it on purpose.

372
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:13,615
What do you mean, "Don't freak..."

373
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,699
"Alex Chat"?

374
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,034
Blow your fucking mind.

375
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,870
Ben! You recorded our video chats?

376
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:21,623
Yeah. My computer
automatically records all of my webcam.

377
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,083
-You can't do that.
-What are you talking about?

378
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,376
lt's a total invasion of privacy.

379
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,086
-l didn't do it, my computer did.
-lt's disgusting.

380
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,462
And you recorded me sleeping?

381
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,381
Again, it was my computer.
lt didn't log off.

382
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,550
-Oh, my God. What are you...
-lt has nothing to do with...

383
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:32,926
You think l just sit here and stare at it?

384
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,427
-Yeah.
-Trust me, in a minute,

385
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:35,762
you're gonna be thanking me
that l recorded this.

386
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:37,848
There! There we go, it's coming.

387
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:51,570
What is he doing?

388
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:54,156
What does it look like he's doing?
He's getting into bed with you.

389
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,166
Right? Tell me that's not creepy.

390
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,292
Are you not freaked out?

391
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:06,585
Yeah, l'm very freaked out.

392
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:07,794
You should be.
That kid could have been...

393
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:09,254
-Look at him! Look at him!
-He put his hand on me!

394
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,173
He's trying to cop a feel!

395
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,341
So creepy.

396
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:15,969
You know, l didn't want to tell you this,

397
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,804
'cause l knew it'd freak you out,

398
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:19,890
but something else happened last night.

399
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,392
What happened?

400
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,186
You fart in your sleep.

401
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:26,354
-l don't fart! Stop!
-You totally...

402
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,649
-Hey.
-Oh, my God. The camera again?

403
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,526
l'm a Kardashian. Did you know this?

404
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:32,861
-No, l didn't.
-Yes, l am, actually.

405
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,112
You look better than a Kardashian.

406
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:36,281
...six years old.
That would freak anybody out,

407
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,825
seeing their mom
get taken away in an ambulance.

408
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,577
Yeah, l know, but l just... l don't know.

409
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:43,455
l think it was really creepy
that he came in my bed.

410
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:44,873
Well...

411
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,083
Listen, he's gonna be here
a few more days.

412
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:48,126
What?

413
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:50,587
Forjust maybe like two or three,
but we got to do it.

414
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,505
He doesn't have anybody. So...

415
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:53,632
He doesn't have anyone?

416
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:54,799
Would you get off the counter, please?

417
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:56,426
l would listen to her.
She's got a knife in her hand.

418
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,886
-Yeah, l've got a very large knife.
-Well...

419
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,054
And she's wielding it.

420
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,222
lnappropriately large knife.

421
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:06,937
What are you doing?

422
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:08,647
No grown-ups allowed.

423
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:11,066
l'm not a grown-up. l can come in.

424
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,817
Want to meet Robbie's friend?

425
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:13,985
Yeah. Who?

426
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,070
He's right there.

427
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,240
Cool! Yeah, l see him.

428
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,075
-Who is he?
-You cannot see him.

429
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:23,495
-What? Yes, l can. He's right there.
-No, you can't. No, you can't.

430
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,829
Hi. lt's nice to meet you. Yeah.

431
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,831
-Hey, guys? Lunch is ready.
-l know you're pretending.

432
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:27,916
Lunch is ready!

433
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,876
Okay, wait for me!

434
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:36,925
-Hi, Ben.
-What's up, Mr. Nelson?

435
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,843
You, too, with the camera, huh?

436
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:39,970
What's up, guys?

437
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:41,388
You interrupted us.

438
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:43,473
-You guys playing the Kinect?
-Yeah.

439
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:44,641
Playing some games?

440
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,017
Yep.

441
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,686
Robbie, why aren't you playing?

442
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,729
l was playing with my friend. Duh.

443
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:50,855
l've heard about this guy.

444
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,024
He's your little, like,
imaginary friend, right?

445
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,859
Well, it sucks he walked away.

446
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:58,280
Wow, that's just
a creepy-looking avatar.

447
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:01,408
ls this what Toby looks like?

448
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,451
Sometimes.

449
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,495
Look, he's back!

450
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:11,209
-How are you doing that?
-Ben! What do you think you're doing?

451
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:13,628
l'm not gonna do
your homework, like, for free

452
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,213
so you can play
Xbox with my little brother.

453
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:17,465
l wasn't! l was showing them...
l was actually...

454
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,551
Hey, do you guys want to see
something really cool

455
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,511
that you can do with the Kinect?

456
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,054
-Okay. Sure.
-Yeah?

457
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,389
You have night vision on this, right?

458
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,641
"l don't like seeing things that are cool!"

459
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,060
lt's too dark in here.

460
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,855
No, just trust me.
All the lights have to be off.

461
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:35,025
Okay, here we go.

462
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:40,864
-That's awesome.
-What?

463
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:43,158
-What's so awesome?
-You can't...

464
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,534
Okay, look at that, bud.

465
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:46,870
-lsn't that cool?
-What is it?

466
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:47,912
l look like l'm an alien.

467
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:50,081
Kinect projects these
tracking dots, basically.

468
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,167
This is the coolest thing l've ever seen!

469
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:53,668
That's how they pick up
your body movement

470
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:54,753
-and all that kind of stuff.
-Right.

471
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:55,920
That's really cool.

472
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:59,049
But you can only see it
with the infrared. lt's badass, right?

473
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:00,258
Watch your language!

474
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:01,384
Okay.

475
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,303
Who wants to have
a space dance party?

476
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,596
-Me!
-Let's go!

477
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,723
Space dance party, coming at ya!

478
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,768
lt's gonna look
super cool when we watch it.

479
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:10,894
lt is kind of cool.

480
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:16,566
Robbie, wanna come...

481
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,693
Robbie, come dance with us.
lt's really fun.

482
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:20,987
Back it up more,
l want to see how crazy he gets.

483
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:24,324
He's tearing up the rug right now.

484
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,159
He's cutting it up real nice.

485
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:28,328
Yeah! Yeah, smash!

486
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,914
He totally just smashed!

487
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:32,499
He's so funny.

488
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,417
What is Robbie doing?

489
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:38,338
Being a fucking weirdo as usual,
just sitting there.

490
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,799
-Look at that. You see that?
-What?

491
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,467
-Are you okay?
-What?

492
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,760
Look. Here, hold this.

493
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:46,721
See how it's moving?

494
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:50,016
-See?
-Yeah.

495
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,063
lt looks like he was
looking at it, though, 'cause...

496
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:56,731
Yeah, no, l see.

497
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:00,693
Maybe it's, like, broken or something.

498
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:05,407
That is just... That is weird.

499
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:07,575
Can we please put this on YouTube?

500
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,285
-No. Ben.
-l'm telling you. He'd be, like, famous.

501
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:11,162
Hey, Wyatt, Robbie.

Come here.

505
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,709
Are we doing this again?

506

l have a video l'm gonna show you guys.

507
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:19,921
Look at the birds.

508
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:33,226
Wait, Wyatt! Wyatt! l didn't mean
to scare you that much. Wait!

509
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,310
Hey, kid.

510
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:37,856
Wyatt, it's me.

511
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:44,529
Mom? Hello?

512
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,900
What the fuck?

513
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:18,665
-Oh, my gosh! Mom.
-Jesus!

514
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,000
-What are you doing?
-You scared me.

515
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:22,627
What are you doing in the dark?

516
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:27,090
-l don't know what l was doing.
-God, l'm exhausted.

517
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:29,384
Would you help me
with some of this stuff, hon?

518
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,677
Yeah.

519
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:31,928
How was school?

520
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:34,556
School was great.
l got an "A" on my chemistry test.

521
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,735
lt's 3:00 in the morning
and l just heard a noise.

522
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:55,451
My parents are sleeping.

523
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:02,208
And here's Wyatt.

524
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:05,753
He's sleeping and dreaming.
As he should be.

525
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:08,756
And, of course, Robbie is out of...

526
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,101
Robbie?

527
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,398
Are you okay?

528
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:39,746
Hey, Robbie, can you look at me?

529
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,791
How come you're not in bed?
Are you scared?

530
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,001
Did you have a nightmare?

531
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,419
l couldn't sleep.

532
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,464
Can you tell me
who you were talking to?

533
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,299
Nobody.

534
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:55,928
What was that?

535
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,598
Robbie, what was that?

536
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:05,063
What the fuck?

537
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:07,940
Watch.

538
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:11,819
Did you see that?

539
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,489
-Did you see that?
-What the fuck was that?

540
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,574
-l know.
-What was that?

541
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:19,160
l don't know.
This is what l've been trying to tell you.

542
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:20,662
Holy shit.

543
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,832
What the fuck is that?

544
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:28,503
-Have you shown anybody else?
-No.

545
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:29,837
Just you. You're special.

546
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,340
...like a light reflection or anything?

547
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,884
Here, pause it on it.

548
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:38,846
No, that's not an...

549
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,098
-Hey, guys.
-Hey, Dad! Dad...

550
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:41,140

551
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:42,725

554
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,358
-What is that?
-...the next frame, it's gone.

555
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,819
What's gone?

556
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:54,696
-Yeah, what is that?
-Can you do that again?

557
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:55,863
There it is.

558
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,574
-Now it's gone.
-What is that?

559
00:26:58,659 --> 00:26:59,867
What is it?

560
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:03,663
That is awesome. That's awesome!

561
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:04,789
-"Awesome"?
-What? No...

562
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,624

564
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,753
Dad, that's not awesome,

565
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:13,631
l can't even work my cell phone
and you guys are, like, amazing.

566
00:27:13,716 --> 00:27:15,258
Does he think that's fake?

567
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:18,136
Ever since he got here,
crazy shit's been happening.

568
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,429
l know.

569
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:28,646
Ben. Ben, be serious. Seriously.

571
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,026
Stop!

572
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,281
Okay, you know what? l'm sorry.

573
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:40,450
Good night. You're gonna
stay in bed, right, Robbie?

574
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:42,785
Yeah? Yeah?

575
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,079
-l'm gonna be right down here.
-Okay.

576
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:47,081
Don't let the bedbugs bite!

577
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:52,211
Jody's been posting so many annoying
Facebook statuses again.

578
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:54,672
-Why? What'd she put up?
-She put, like, a duckface.

579
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:56,507
Like, she's posting all those
duckfaces of, like,

580
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:59,010
bad hair day,
and her hair looks really good.

581
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,386
Wait, what is a duckface?

582
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:01,721
Front door open.

583
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:03,931
What?

584
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:07,894
What? You keep breaking up.

585
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,313
You're frozen. You're frozen.

586
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:12,023
Where are you?
Are you on your iPhone?

587
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,107

588

...pictures of duckface on your phone.

591
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,826
-What?
-l mean, your Face...

592
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:27,747
-l can't... Ben, l can't hear you.
-What?

593
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:29,207

594
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:31,125
...l have to be really quiet because
my parents are asleep...

595
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,376
What?

596
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,339
l can't hear you.

597
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,054

598
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,555
My parents are asleep!

599
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,224
You need to stop hitting me!

600
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:47,725
-Quiet!
-Stop hitting me!

601
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,560
Were you here the whole time?

602
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,229
-l was here for a while.
-Jesus Christ!

603
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:52,605

604
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,900
Fuck, come on. lt was a joke. Relax!

605
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,235
Well, Ben, it wasn't funny.

606
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:59,111
Okay, so l won't do it again!

607
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:01,030

Can you be the one that believes me?

610
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:05,409
That l think that
there's something in my house?

611
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:09,914
Okay, so there is a supernatural force
in the house coming after you? Yeah.

612
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:12,333
-Yes.
-So what?

613
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,335
Get out of the house?
Should we go to a hotel?

614
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:15,753
-No, l just want...
-You can stay with me.

615
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:19,090
You know how you recorded
our video chats?

616
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:23,010
Yes. lt's all chats, not just ours.

That big of a perv.

618
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,848
Whatever.

619
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:29,433
Can you do that to other computers?

620
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:32,019
Yeah. l mean,
that's what l... Yeah, it's easy.

621
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:35,273
You understand that, in turn,
you'd be spying on your whole family.

622
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,067
-Right?
-Yeah.

623
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,194
Yeah.

624
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:42,864
-You... You're being serious, right now?
-l'm serious. l want to do it.

625
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:44,699
l want to set up a camera
so l can catch it.

626
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,492
So it's just gonna run all the time?

627
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:49,370
Yeah. This is an amazing computer
for a six-year-old, by the way.

628
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,705
Yeah, he got my hand-me-down.

629
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,790
And then just face it towards over here.

630
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,625
That'll be good.

631
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,793
Where does your mom keep the laptop?

632
00:29:55,878 --> 00:29:58,170
Over there, in the corner.

633
00:29:58,255 --> 00:29:59,463
What does she use it for?

634
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:00,798
Recipes and stuff.

635
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:02,049
Okay...

636
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,802

637
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:06,345
Yep. We are good.

638
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,223
l don't know if this
"hole" thing is gonna work.

639
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,559
What? lt's for sure going to work.

640
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:15,187
That's gonna be awesome.

641
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:18,900
As long as you keep it on at all times,
you're good to go.

642
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,151
All right.

643
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,153
We're on the hunt. We need the gear.

644
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,779
Know what l'm saying?

645
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:59,565
Robbie, you good?
Come on, hon, let's go. Get in bed.

646
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:00,775
Okay.

647
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,860
Hey.

648
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:47,154
Wyatt. Wake up.

649
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:49,699
Wake up.

650
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:51,909
Hey.

651
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,078
Away!

652
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,875
Hurry. Let's go here.

653
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,634
No, he's going that way!

654
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:54,972
-Get him!
-Wyatt!

655
00:32:55,057 --> 00:32:56,640
-Come on.
-Wyatt!

656
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,311
Wyatt. Wyatt.

657
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,230
Robbie! Robbie, get upstairs, please.

658
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:05,858
Wyatt.

659
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,735
Your dad is asleep.
He's gonna have a fit!

660
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,570
lt's 3:00 in the morning.

661
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,655
We were playing, Mom.

662
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:22,833
So, did anything happen?

663
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:25,086
Well, l would know
if l could watch the footage.

664
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,337
Let me show...

665
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,546
You need your username and password.

666
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:29,673
l told you your username
is your email address.

667
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:30,800
Yeah...

668
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:32,551
Password, "OddRobbie." Right?

669
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:33,969
l thought it was "BigBen."

670
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:35,096
Well,

671
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:38,641
you don't need a password
for that, right? Okay. So...

672
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:40,184
...then you export it.

673
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:41,852
-Okay.
-And once it has exported...

674
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:43,270
-...it turns into a QuickTime file...
-Yeah.

675
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:47,149
...which you can then bring back up
here and you can watch it as clips.

676
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,275
Okay.

677
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,444
-Okay?
-lt's really complicated.

678
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:52,613
-Did you want to watch it?
-Yeah! l do, l do.

679
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:53,697
-Hon?
-Yeah.

680
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:54,865
Gonna be late, l got to go.

681
00:33:54,950 --> 00:34:00,121
And when you-know-who
is in here, door open. Got it?

682
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:01,705
-You know it!
-Okay.

683
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:02,957
Yes.

684
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,375
Who is "you-know-who"?

685
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,127
She thinks...

686
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:07,545
You're not allowed to be in my room.

687
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,274
Front door open.

688
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,486
l'm home!

689
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,203
Wyatt?

690
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:40,054
Wyatt, are you home?

691
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:45,017
Robbie?

692
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:50,814
Wyatt?

693
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:44,451
Mom?

694
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:18,819
Hello?

695
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,733
Wyatt?

696
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,421
What is wrong with you?

697
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:21,608
What the fuck?

698
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:31,034
Robbie?

699
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,786
He doesn't like you watching us!

700
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:35,581
What? Robbie?

701
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:37,666
Robbie, what is going on?

702
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,794
Robbie, have you been
in the house the whole time?

703
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:41,962
Have you been here the whole time?

704
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,964
l know you know what happened.

705
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:45,799
Who did it?

706
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,384
Hello!

707
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:53,307
Don't come in my room again!

708
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,476
lt looks like they put it
straight into the drywall.

709
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:56,894
Dad, Dad, Dad, tell him that
that one was swinging.

710
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:57,978
What?

711
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,563
Tell him that
that chandelier was swinging.

712
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:02,065
And, you know,
l've got three or four other chandeliers

713
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,233
that you guys installed.

714
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:04,902
...could have killed my
daughter. She was standing...

715
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:07,738
l'm not waiting. l need
somebody over here today.

716
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,907
Alex, would you please be careful.
Don't walk on the glass.

717
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:12,493
Mom, l'm saying l don't
think it was an accident.

718
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:13,827
What are you talking about?

719
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:15,412
l just feel like...

720
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:16,830
Mom! Listen to me!

721
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:21,210
l feel like Robbie brought
something into the house and it's...

722
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,962
lt's messing with me.

723
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:26,798
-Sweetie, l know it was super scary.
-l've been hearing noises.

724
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:32,137
l would have freaking lost my mind
if l was standing under it.

725
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:34,640
Just a freak accident,
and l'm worried about that one,

726
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:36,350
l'm worried about these in here...

727
00:40:36,518 --> 00:40:39,520
This stuff started
happening ever since Robbie got here.

728
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:43,148
Like, l came home and Wyatt's
train turned on by itself.

729
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:45,025
And l heard noises.

730
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,778
Honey, would you just put
that away for five seconds?

731
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:48,862
This is not really...

732
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:49,089
lt's 2:00 in the morning

733
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:52,676
and there's a bunch of cars at Robbie's
house and l'm gonna go check it out.

734
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,657
Who are all these people?

735
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:33,550
-Hi. Can l help you?
-Sorry.

736
00:42:33,635 --> 00:42:34,968
Wrong house!

737
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,137
Cool!

738
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,811
Please, just watch the video.
lt was at, like, 2:00 in the morning.

739
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,646
And there were so many
cars across the street,

740
00:44:09,731 --> 00:44:11,481
and nobody's supposed to be there.

741
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,734
Now watch. Just watch.

742
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:16,820
lt's weird.

743
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,405
Hi. Can I heIp you?

744
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:19,489
Sorry.

745
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:23,034
Did you know the sun is a star,
not a planet?

746
00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:24,745
No.

747
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:30,083
Did you know there's only two planets
that have rings around them?

748
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:36,506
Hey, Wyatt.

749
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:38,341
Do you want to see him?

750
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:41,720
Okay.

751
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:44,431
Okay. Follow me.

752
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:49,102
ls he nice?

753
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,605
lf you do what he says.

754
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:11,666
How do you know
that that wasn't his mom?

755
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:13,043
-You've never seen her.
-Because she's young.

756
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,961
My mom said that she's young.

757
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:18,882
-Young as in, she's, like, 30 young?
-Young as in, like, not 300 years old.

758
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,175
Or like, "l'm an older woman

759
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:21,718
"and l don't want to make
my age sound old"?

760
00:45:21,803 --> 00:45:23,303
She's, like, 30, l think.

761
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:28,475
Oh, my God. Wyatt!

762
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:30,560
Come on.
Let's go see what they're doing.

763
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:31,812
Hold on.

764
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:41,571
Wyatt? What are you doing, Wyatt?

765
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:43,323
This place is a mess!

766
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,742
Robbie's drawing pictures
on me so l can see him!

767
00:45:45,827 --> 00:45:47,828
No, no, no, this is so bad!
Mom's gonna get so mad.

768
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:50,163
-Oh, God, we have to clean this off.
-Jesus!

769
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:51,915
What are all these
weird drawings on Wyatt?

770
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,166
Robbie, who is he gonna see?

771
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:55,085
Why'd you make this mess?
You never do this.

772
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:56,253
Robbie, l asked you a question.

773
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:58,213
Then he said
that he was gonna see him.

774
00:45:58,297 --> 00:46:00,340
Who's he gonna be able to see?

775
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,592
He does not like you.

776
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:05,846
What? Who? Who does not like me?

777
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,848
-You'll find out.
-Wyatt, why did you do this to yourself?

778
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:08,932
-You have to take a bath.
-What the fuck?

779
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:18,585
What?

780
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:21,713
l can't hear you.

781
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:25,800
What?

782
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:36,728
They're all sleeping.

783
00:47:38,064 --> 00:47:39,397
l'm sure.

784
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:45,904
Maybe.

785
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,202
Hey, guys.

786
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,207
Hey, what are you doing?

787
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:02,253
Wyatt, can l talk to you?

788
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:04,547
Can you pause the game, or...

789
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:06,216
Just let Robbie play. lt's Robbie's turn.

790
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:08,134
Why did you get up last night?

791
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:13,139
Did you have a nightmare?

792
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:19,813
Don't tell her anything.

793
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,731
Robbie! He can tell me...

794
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:23,233
l don't like the way that,
when your friend's around,

795
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:24,734
you won't talk to me and tell me things.

796
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:26,569
l really don't appreciate it.

797
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,078
This is the video from when
l caught them in...

798
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:36,705
-Wait, pause! Pause!
-What?

799
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:38,540
Okay. Hold on, hold on.

800
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,291
-Right there! Look at that.
-What?

801
00:48:41,002 --> 00:48:43,712
-This?
-Yeah. What is that? What is that?

802
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:45,880
-What is that?
-Yes!

803
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:47,924
lt looks like a triangle
with a circle in the middle.

804
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:48,967
No shit!

805
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:50,593
-Right there.
-That?

806
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:52,762
Looks like scribbles on his back.

807
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:54,264
No, no, it's not scribbles on his back.

808
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:55,849
lt's the same symbol!

809
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:58,685
lt's a circle in a triangle, Alex. Like...

810
00:48:58,811 --> 00:49:01,688
-This obviously means something.
-Yeah, it's shapes.

811
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:05,608
"Circle in a triangle."

812
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:09,863
Look, that's... That's close to it.

813
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:11,072
Try it. Yeah.

814
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:13,283
-Right there.
-Holy shit! Yeah.

815
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:16,036
lt's a "Hattusac symbol of fertility..."

816
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:18,538
-"...often present in sacred rituals...
-Wait.

817
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:21,291
"...whereupon a demon
would take possession of a male..."

818
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:22,959
"ln order for the demon
to enter the host,

819
00:49:23,044 --> 00:49:27,047
"the Hittites believed three stages
had to be completed.

820
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:30,050
"One..." Are you listening?

821
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:31,760
"Actuation.

822
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:35,388
"The host will begin
to exhibit signs of pre...

823
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:37,515
"Preternatural ability."

824
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,060
Robbie's been doing that.
Been doing that a lot.

825
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:41,478
"Affirmation.

826
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:43,188
"The host would...

827
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:46,941
"The host would have to prove
its preternatural ability to the demon."

828
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:49,402
What was he doing last night?
He was probably proving that.

829
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:51,071
"Sacrifice.

830
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:56,451
"The host will be compelled
to spill the blood of an inviolate."

831
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:58,328
-Who is?
-A being...

832
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:02,582
lt's "a being that has not been profaned
and remains pure."

833
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:06,211
So, like a... Like a virgin?

834
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:09,005
Yeah. Yeah, l guess so.

835
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:10,423
You're fucked.

836
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,134
You're fucked, too.

837
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:14,385
No, l'm not!

838
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,054
Yes, l have.

839
00:50:16,222 --> 00:50:18,515
-Like, three times.
-Really? Yeah?

840
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,559
Three times, four different girls. S'up?

841
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:25,688
l understand you're
a little nervous, due to this.

842
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:27,273
We can get it out of the way for you.

843
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:28,399
But... No.

844
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:30,568
-Just run upstairs real quick.
-Ben. Stop.

845
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:39,911
Hi. WeIcome back to
Cooking with Chef Mary.

846
00:50:40,121 --> 00:50:42,580
l'm frequently asked basic
questions about the kitchen.

847
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:47,460
After that, cut the beII
pepper into long strips.

848
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:57,387
Finally, pile all of the red
bell pepper strips together...

849
00:50:57,471 --> 00:51:00,932
Mom!

850
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:04,561
-Wyatt?
-You're ready to go. Voilá.

851
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:05,895
What, honey?

852
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:09,107
l can't find my tiger! Where'd you put it?

853
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:10,567
Honey, it's under your bed.

854
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:11,943
lt's not there!

855
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:14,696
lt's under your bed. Just look for it.

856
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:15,822
l am!

857
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:18,533
Most commonly, roasted for
a variety of dishes.

858
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:19,951
Mom!

859
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:21,494
What?

860
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:27,292
l found it!

861
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:30,545
...red bell pepper, you can add it
at various points in your cooking

862
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:34,007
to give your dish a slightly
different fIavor and texture.

863
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,468
The cool thing about red bell peppers

864
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:39,470
is that they have more
vitamins and nutrients

865
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:40,638
than green bell peppers.

866
00:51:40,723 --> 00:51:44,350
What the fuck did l do
with the fucking knife?

867
00:51:44,852 --> 00:51:49,272
Red bell peppers are not hot
and, in fact, they're sweet.

868
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:51,399
So when you're cooking,
if you want a sweeter dish,

869
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,443
add lots of bell pepper.

870
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:56,613
And if you don't want a
sweet dish, then make sure that...

871
00:51:56,697 --> 00:52:00,950
...cut the top and the bottom off.
And don't forget...

872
00:52:01,035 --> 00:52:02,577
l'm insane.

873
00:52:02,995 --> 00:52:06,206
...and run it verticaI down
the sides of the bell pepper.

874
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:08,791
Open the beII pepper up,

875
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:12,378
and use the bIade to cut out
the white pith and the seeds.

876
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:16,341
Remember, the sharper
the knife, the easier it is...

877
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:23,890
Want some cheese, hon?

878
00:52:24,892 --> 00:52:26,517
Want some more cheese?

879
00:52:26,602 --> 00:52:28,603
-Wyatt, want some more cheese?
-No.

880
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:31,230
Did you hear that?

881
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:33,399
lt's just Robbie.

882
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,109
Don't do what right now?

883
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:36,694
Talk about what's happening?

884
00:52:36,946 --> 00:52:39,322
Don't start with the noises.
Not in front of your brother.

885
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:55,059
All right, you guys.
We'll be back in a bit. Okay?

886
00:55:55,144 --> 00:55:56,310
-Okay.
-You be good.

887
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:58,062
-Bye, Mom.
-Bye, hon.

888
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:16,247
Front door open.

889
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:19,500
Wyatt.

890
00:56:19,585 --> 00:56:20,835
Yeah?

891
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:22,336
lt's time to go.

892
00:56:22,421 --> 00:56:24,463
-Now?
-Yeah, now.

893
00:56:25,257 --> 00:56:26,507
l thought we were going tonight.

894
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:28,384
They're waiting for us. Come on.

895
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:39,854
Are you kidding me?

896
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:41,981
Those little shits.

897
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:48,863
Front door open.

898
00:56:52,451 --> 00:56:54,702
-Hey, watch out!
-Fucking Prius!

899
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:56,245
You're gonna get yourself killed!

900
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:16,015
Hello?

901
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:23,439
Wyatt?

902
00:57:25,317 --> 00:57:27,193
Hello, is anybody home?

903
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,209
Hello?

904
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:53,552
Hello? lt's Alex from across the street.

905
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:56,806
ls anybody home?

906
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:02,395
Guys? Guys, come on,
we're not supposed to be in here.

907
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:26,043
What?

908
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:30,673
Wyatt?

909
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:35,594
What? What are...
What are you guys doing?

910
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:37,930
We got to go back home right now!
l'm supposed to be babysitting.

911
00:58:38,015 --> 00:58:39,015
-No!
-Yes, yes!

912
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:41,267
-Wyatt! No.
-No, Wyatt, stay here!

913
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:44,186
...doing? Oh, my God.
Mom is gonna be so mad.

914
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:45,354
l was supposed to be babysitting.

915
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:50,735
-Hey. Alex, yeah?
-Yeah.

916
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:52,862
-l'm Robbie's mom.
-l'm so sorry.

917
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:54,739
l didn't know you were home yet.

918
00:58:54,823 --> 00:58:56,699
No, no, no, it's fine. lt's fine.
We've just been hanging out.

919
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:59,368
Can you thank your mom for me?
You guys have been such a big help.

920
00:58:59,453 --> 00:59:01,579
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

921
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:03,748
Okay, Wyatt, you're in trouble.

922
00:59:03,832 --> 00:59:05,458
-Thank you for hanging out with Robbie.
-Wyatt.

923
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:06,751
-Wyatt?
-Yeah?

924
00:59:06,835 --> 00:59:07,877
Shake.

925
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,879
He looks just like his mom.

926
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:11,547
-Shake.
-l guess so.

927
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:12,882
-Handshake.
-Wyatt, let's go. No, no, no.

928
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:14,133
Let's just... Can we just...

929
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:17,094
You can't just run across
the street and not tell me.

930
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:19,722
That's so not cool.

931
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:22,808
What if you got, like,
kidnapped or something?

932
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:25,394
We live in a good neighborhood.

933
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,396
She didn't even look sick.

934
00:59:28,482 --> 00:59:30,483
Well, that's good. She's better.

935
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,152
No, like, she didn't look sick at all.
Like she hadn't been sick.

936
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:35,946
Don't be ridiculous, Alex.
Are you kidding?

937
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:37,740
You saw her get
taken away in an ambulance.

938
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,492
What? She wasn't sick?
She just did it for fun?

939
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:43,162
She did call. She called me
and she left a message and...

940
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:47,458
l missed her call and then
they just went over there.

941
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:48,876
She called you?

942
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:50,961
But how would Robbie know that?

943
00:59:51,046 --> 00:59:52,296
You want some of this?

944
00:59:52,381 --> 00:59:54,632
Oh, my God. You have to try this.

945
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:55,758
-Robbie wouldn't know that.
-Come here.

946
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:56,926
Here, l need you to taste test.

947
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:58,761
You're happy that
Robbie is gone, right?

948
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:00,805
You wanted him gone?
He's gone. So there you go.

949
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:51,725
Hon? Come back upstairs, please.
l'm sorry, just come back...

950
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:53,269
-This knife...
-What are you doing with the knife?

951
01:02:53,353 --> 01:02:54,520
This knife just came from nowhere.

952
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:55,813
Honey, just come back upstairs, okay?

953
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:58,482
This knife just ended up here.
Did you see that?

954
01:02:58,567 --> 01:03:01,068
Doug, please, could you
come back upstairs? l'm sorry, okay?

955
01:03:01,528 --> 01:03:03,946
Fine, don't come back upstairs!

956
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:37,813
Remember when
you went to Robbie's house?

957
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:40,149
Why were you there in the first place?

958
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:42,318
l wanted to meet her.

959
01:03:42,402 --> 01:03:44,945
What'd she say to you? lt's so weird.

960
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:48,949
That me and Robbie are friends
because we're both adopted.

961
01:03:49,034 --> 01:03:50,743
Robbie's adopted, too?

962
01:03:52,037 --> 01:03:53,829
How did she know
that you're adopted, though?

963
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:54,955
She just knew.

964
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,749
What else did she say to you?

965
01:03:59,044 --> 01:04:01,754
That my other family needs me back.

966
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:05,674
What? Wyatt,
what are you talking about?

967
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:07,426
We're your family.

968
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:03,542
What?

969
01:06:06,713 --> 01:06:08,797
l can't hear you.

970
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:13,051
Okay, l will.

971
01:06:25,064 --> 01:06:27,065
Very sleepy.

972
01:06:30,904 --> 01:06:32,738
Yeah, sure.

973
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:36,742
l don't know.

974
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:43,040
No, it's not.

975
01:06:44,209 --> 01:06:45,918
No, it's not!

976
01:06:47,045 --> 01:06:48,754
My name's Wyatt!

977
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:51,673
lt's not Hunter!

978
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:55,677
My name's not Hunter!

979
01:06:55,762 --> 01:06:58,388
Wyatt? What are you doing?

980
01:07:00,892 --> 01:07:02,726
Buddy, what are you doing down here?

981
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:04,812
You have a nightmare?

982
01:07:05,897 --> 01:07:08,440
You all right? You awake?

983
01:07:15,949 --> 01:07:17,282
What the fuck is Robbie doing?

984
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:21,411
Hey, guys?

985
01:07:23,957 --> 01:07:25,791
Wyatt, where'd Robbie go?

986
01:07:30,088 --> 01:07:32,089
What were you guys talking about?

987
01:07:43,101 --> 01:07:45,477
He said he got me ready.

988
01:07:46,604 --> 01:07:47,729
Ready for what?

989
01:07:47,814 --> 01:07:51,233
l don't know, but he said it's my time.

990
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:52,359
What do you mean it's...

991
01:07:57,448 --> 01:07:58,907
Wyatt?

992
01:07:58,992 --> 01:08:00,993
Come on, hon, the tub's ready!

993
01:08:06,124 --> 01:08:08,500
Come on, honey. Tub's ready.

994
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,794
Come on. You can bring your movie.

995
01:08:16,342 --> 01:08:19,052
Just put it over there.
You want bubbles?

996
01:08:19,137 --> 01:08:20,470
Yeah.

997
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:23,223
All right, Mr. Bubble!

998
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:51,335
Honey, what did l say?
You're gonna get your computer wet.

999
01:08:51,711 --> 01:08:53,211
Put it back here.

1000
01:08:54,505 --> 01:08:55,714
Are you good in there?

1001
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:57,883
You got everything you need?
Got your bubbles? Everything?

1002
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,593
-Yep.
-Okay. l'll be right back. Two minutes...

1003
01:09:50,061 --> 01:09:51,061
Hello?

1004
01:10:20,925 --> 01:10:21,925
Mom!

1005
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:45,449
Yeah, we talked about it.

1006
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:47,242
Yeah.

1007
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:49,077
What time are you coming back?

1008
01:10:49,162 --> 01:10:50,370
Okay.

1009
01:10:50,455 --> 01:10:52,122
Yeah, no, l got to go. Wyatt's upstairs.

1010
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:26,656
Come on, honey, you got to get out.

1011
01:11:26,741 --> 01:11:28,241
Let's go, sweetheart.

1012
01:11:28,326 --> 01:11:29,910
Come on, Wyatt.

1013
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:32,913
Come on. Wyatt. Wyatt.

1014
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:34,539
Wyatt. Come on, you got to get out.

1015
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:39,836
You all right? Okay, come on.

1016
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:06,655
l'll tell you what, l have never seen
our daughter so knocked out.

1017
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:08,615
She is out.

1018
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:10,283
-Good.
-l mean...

1019
01:12:10,368 --> 01:12:14,621
l gave her one of my sleeping pills.

1020
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:15,705
What?

1021
01:12:16,457 --> 01:12:17,666
-l had to.
-What?

1022
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:20,168
-She's been up for two days.
-Not prescription?

1023
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:21,253
Yeah.

1024
01:12:21,963 --> 01:12:22,963
Holly, what the hell?

1025
01:12:55,413 --> 01:12:58,165
-She's 1 5 years old, you don't do that.
-What...

1026
01:12:58,249 --> 01:12:59,374
l mean, are you fucking crazy?

1027
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:01,001
l take them all the time.
What difference does it make?

1028
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:02,085
This makes me nuts!

1029
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:04,171
You're gonna give her a drug
like that and not ask me?

1030
01:14:27,672 --> 01:14:28,838
Hey, hon?

1031
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:31,800
Honey? Hon?

1032
01:14:32,009 --> 01:14:33,760
lt's 7:30, you got to get up.

1033
01:14:34,387 --> 01:14:35,971
Come on, honey. Come on, get up.

1034
01:14:36,055 --> 01:14:37,555
You're gonna be late for school.

1035
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:43,311
Are you good?

1036
01:14:43,396 --> 01:14:45,563
l feel like l got hit by a truck.

1037
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:53,154
Why won't it open?

1038
01:15:01,289 --> 01:15:02,622
"Hunter."

1039
01:15:08,212 --> 01:15:10,880
Wyatt. Did you draw that?

1040
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:15,176
What's a "Hunter"?
What does that mean?

1041
01:15:16,262 --> 01:15:18,179
-What does it mean?
-lt's my name.

1042
01:15:18,723 --> 01:15:21,725
No, it's not. Your name is not Hunter.

1043
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:24,102
Well, it used to be.

1044
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:26,354
No, it didn't.

1045
01:15:26,439 --> 01:15:27,564
Yes, it did.

1046
01:15:34,322 --> 01:15:35,613
Okay.

1047
01:15:43,998 --> 01:15:45,415
Stupid computer.

1048
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:46,958
Mom, l don't want to babysit.

1049
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:48,835
Honey, you're overreacting.

1050
01:15:48,919 --> 01:15:50,628
We're only gonna be gone
for a few hours.

1051
01:15:50,713 --> 01:15:53,089
l don't want to be alone in this house!

1052
01:15:57,345 --> 01:15:58,345
You bitch!

1053
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:24,579
-What'd you say?
-What did they...

1054
01:16:24,663 --> 01:16:28,083
What did your parents say
about his original birth parents?

1055
01:16:28,167 --> 01:16:29,417
They didn't say anything.

1056
01:16:29,502 --> 01:16:31,294
They just got mad at me for asking.

1057
01:16:31,379 --> 01:16:33,463
They were like, "How dare you
talk about his adoption!

1058
01:16:33,547 --> 01:16:34,714
"He's part of the family."

1059
01:16:34,799 --> 01:16:36,341
And l know he's... l'm not saying that.

1060
01:16:36,467 --> 01:16:38,885
...freak out and just
start screaming and crying.

1061
01:16:38,969 --> 01:16:40,845
And he wouldn't sleep.

1062
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:44,224
He'd just wake up in the middle of the
night and start screaming.

1063
01:16:44,308 --> 01:16:46,935
My dad was the only one
that could touch him.

1064
01:16:47,019 --> 01:16:49,854
That's ridicuIous.
He's not like that now, though.

1065
01:16:49,939 --> 01:16:51,439
That's what l'm saying.

1066
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:55,193
Now he's starting to get quiet again.

1067
01:16:55,486 --> 01:16:57,237
He doesn't talk to me.

1068
01:16:57,613 --> 01:16:59,489
Okay, weII, Iisten.

1069
01:16:59,573 --> 01:17:01,866
Even though it's
a cIosed case, or whatever,

1070
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:03,535
l can totally figure it out.

1071
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:05,161
Everything's on the lnternet...

1072
01:17:05,246 --> 01:17:06,704
Are you sure you can't
come over tonight?

1073
01:17:06,789 --> 01:17:08,415
We really got to watch the footage.

1074
01:17:08,499 --> 01:17:09,958
I know, I can't.

1075
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:14,629
What? l'm sorry. l'm sorry.

1076
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:17,507
I can come over tomorrow,
though, and l'll figure it all out.

1077
01:17:18,175 --> 01:17:20,176
Get a soIution to the probIem.

1078
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:21,803
That'll be perfect.

1079
01:17:22,847 --> 01:17:26,266
lt ranks as weird, he says his name is
something that it's not. You know?

1080
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:28,143
Yeah, l know.

1081
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:34,649
-Did you hear that?
-What's up?

1082
01:17:34,733 --> 01:17:36,401
The garage just opened.

1083
01:17:37,194 --> 01:17:38,778
Are your parents home?

1084
01:17:38,863 --> 01:17:42,198
l don't know. They shouldn't be.

1085
01:17:44,034 --> 01:17:46,202
Garage door open.

1086
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:04,429
Can you see it?

1087
01:18:05,222 --> 01:18:07,724
Yeah, no, it Iooks Iike it's, Iike, stuck.

1088
01:18:09,477 --> 01:18:10,477
Yeah...

1089
01:18:12,438 --> 01:18:14,606
l hate this fucking house.

1090
01:18:18,486 --> 01:18:21,321
Okay, so l'll talk to you later?

1091
01:18:21,405 --> 01:18:24,032
-All right, l'll talk to you tomorrow.
-Okay, T-T-Y-L.

1092
01:18:41,759 --> 01:18:44,093
Garage door open.

1093
01:19:35,312 --> 01:19:37,564
Help me! Let me out, please!

1094
01:19:58,002 --> 01:19:59,502
Help!

1095
01:20:01,922 --> 01:20:03,256
Please open!

1096
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:14,684
Hunter?

1097
01:20:15,352 --> 01:20:16,686
lt's your Aunt Katie.

1098
01:20:19,690 --> 01:20:21,316
Open the door, Hunter.

1099
01:20:23,694 --> 01:20:25,028
Come on.

1100
01:20:25,446 --> 01:20:26,779
Open the door.

1101
01:20:28,282 --> 01:20:30,283
You're almost ready, Hunter.

1102
01:20:31,368 --> 01:20:33,036
Hunter, open the door.

1103
01:20:34,705 --> 01:20:35,705
Please!

1104
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:40,168
Help!

1105
01:20:40,878 --> 01:20:42,211
lt's okay.

1106
01:20:42,921 --> 01:20:44,756
l'll be here until you're ready.

1107
01:21:00,397 --> 01:21:01,898
Can't breathe...

1108
01:21:41,146 --> 01:21:42,814
l almost died! l...

1109
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:44,982
The car turned on by itself!
l didn't even have the keys!

1110
01:21:45,067 --> 01:21:46,150
Honey, it's all right.

1111
01:21:46,235 --> 01:21:48,486
l didn't have the keys, Dad!
lt's impossible!

1112
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:50,738
-Okay, honey...
-lt was impossible! Can l just...

1113
01:21:50,823 --> 01:21:52,573
Just let me... Just let me call Ben

1114
01:21:52,658 --> 01:21:53,950
and try to figure out a plan.

1115
01:21:54,034 --> 01:21:56,744
-l need to show you! l'm not crazy!
-Honey, come on. Okay.

1116
01:21:56,829 --> 01:21:58,413
They just think l'm crazy.

1117
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:00,748
Do you want me to come over?

1118
