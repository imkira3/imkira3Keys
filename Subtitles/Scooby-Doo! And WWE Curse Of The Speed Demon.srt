Mr. McMahon said we can have

<i>What gave you the idea

100

<i>Actually, Michael, my talented daughter

- Wonder what the "D.C." stands for.
- Delicious and Crunchy!

130
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,403
It stands for Deadman's Curve.
See, it's part of the race.

131
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:28,608
These pretzels copy the road

Deadman's Curve?

Yeah. Scary-licious.

136

Did you know, the Legendmobile

137
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:46,058

Oh, Fred.

00:08:55,534 --> 00:08:57,737

We are. When he's on TV.

148
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,171
- But in real life...

Even better than <i>Tornado Divers,</i>

153

I'm just happy to be a part

154
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:58,531
Oh, you're gonna be right in the thick
of it, Kofi. Just wait and see.

155
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:01,465
You're talking to the guy who pitched
holding the Olympics in a hurricane!

156
00:10:07,439 --> 00:10:10,376
The American Dream
and the unstoppable force.

157
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:13,010
Let's bury the competition.

158
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,819
And they're off!

159
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,587
<i>What acceleration!</i>

160
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:26,525
<i>They've passed the first marker two-tenths
of a second faster than the Company Car.</i>

161
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:30,396
<i>There's a good reason why the Undertaker
and Rhodes are the favorites.</i>

162
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:33,397
Let me tell you what.
We gonna make it to the pay window.

163
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,511
<i>Oh, my! Ladies and gentlemen,
there's been an explosion on the track.</i>

164
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:47,713
<i>And out of nowhere,
a new car has appeared.</i>

165
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,180
<i>The new car is chasing the Legendmobile!</i>

166
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:52,585
What the devil?

167
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,687
The devil it is.

168
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:57,087
This just got a lot more interesting.

169
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:01,758
<i>Our sky drone cameras
are picking up the driver, Michael.</i>

170
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,934
- That's no Superstar.
- Then who is it?

171
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:12,036
Like, not anyone I wanna know.

172
00:11:12,286 --> 00:11:14,320
Me, neither.

173
00:11:19,044 --> 00:11:20,646
<i>Security's been called.</i>

174
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:22,648
<i>This monstrous vehicle
must be stopped before it...</i>

175
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:27,086
<i>No! It just rammed into the Legendmobile!</i>

176
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:31,054
Stranger, you just dug your own grave.

177
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:35,461
Yes! The Undertaker is fighting back!

178
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:38,130
<i>This demonic driver picked
a fight with the wrong...</i>

179
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,999
<i>Wait a minute! Is that a...</i>

180
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:41,632
<i>A scorpion tail?</i>

181
00:11:46,538 --> 00:11:49,975
<i>My goodness! The demonic racer
has wrecked the Legendmobile.</i>

182
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:52,812
<i>Team Legend may be seriously hurt!</i>

183
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:55,815
<i>I'm seeing some movement
inside the twisted wreckage.</i>

184
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:58,415
<i>Yes! Team Legend is okay!</i>

185
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:09,995
The curse of Inferno is upon you!

186
00:12:10,095 --> 00:12:13,163
End this race or suffer!

187
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:16,635
Doesn't seem neighborly at all.

188
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:20,239
<i>Looks like Dusty is gonna
teach this monster a lesson.</i>

189
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:26,011
We gonna get funky like a monkey.

190
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:28,511
<i>Vintage Dusty Rhodes!</i>

191
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:34,353
<i>The American Dream is off his feet!</i>

192
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:38,390
<i>Oh, no!</i>

193
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:45,629
- Oh!
- Dusty!

194
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,473
Run, creature. But you can't hide.

195
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:58,010
In the end, no man or beast

196
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,378
escapes the Undertaker.

197
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,566
Eh, I just threw out my back, man.
Don't worry about it.

198
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:24,570
I know, Dusty, but the doc says
you need to take it easy for a while.

199
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,839
I still ain't letting go of my dream.

200
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,908
Buy them grandkids that ranch.

201
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,377
So they can learn them three R's...

202
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,879
Riding, roping and ranching.

203
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,715
You'll get better, Pop. I've seen it.

204
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:40,920
We'll carry your dream
across the finish line.

205
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,753
I know you will, boys.

206
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:44,421
I know.

207
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,261
So, Undertaker.

208
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:53,032
Does this mean, that you'll withdraw
from the Muscle Moto X?

209
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:56,368
The Undertaker never backs down.

210
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:59,772
When I find that gutless demon driver,

211
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:04,643
I will deliver him back to the darkness
from whence he came.

212
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:05,942
And he will...

213
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:07,646
rest...

214
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:08,948
in...

215
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,447
peace.

216
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,789
Paige, Miz.

217
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:19,291
Can I get your reactions
to today's chilling events?

218
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,161
Another monster attack? Really?

219
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:23,595
- Ow!
- We're all pulling for Dusty

220
00:14:23,695 --> 00:14:25,664
and we hope he makes a complete recovery.

221
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:29,134
To all my worried fans,
the money-maker was spared.

222
00:14:29,234 --> 00:14:33,505
<i>The Miz is still in the game
and the Muscle Moto X can now continue.</i>

223
00:14:33,605 --> 00:14:35,140
<i>You can all thank me later.</i>

224
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,243
<i>We'll thank you when you
dry up and blow away.</i>

225
00:14:38,343 --> 00:14:40,679
Like, let's get out of here
while the getting is good.

226
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:43,148
Like, before that scary demon comes back.

227
00:14:43,248 --> 00:14:45,150
Yeah. Good idea.

228
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,252
Whoa! Not so fast.

229
00:14:47,352 --> 00:14:48,988
We need to get to the bottom of this.

230
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:51,790
The bottom of this might be way, way down!

231
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,926
Like, in the underworld down!

232
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:55,661
Shaggy, you can't run away.

233
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:57,661
Yeah, what about the food truck?

234
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,833
Oh, thanks for reminding me.

235
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:03,032
Grab the food, Scoob.

236
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:13,879
- Gulp.
- Mr. McMahon.

237
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:19,351
We're just, like, um,
taking your food for a walk.

238
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:21,153
I'm glad I found you all.

239
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,355
I have a feeling we haven't seen
the last of that demon driver,

240
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:27,192
and now, they're talking
about a curse on this race.

241
00:15:27,292 --> 00:15:30,863
I'd feel a lot better if Mystery
Incorporated were on the case.

242
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,129
Will ya help me?

243
00:15:32,764 --> 00:15:33,866
Don't say it.

244
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,534
Please don't say it.

245
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,467
You can count on us, Mr. McMahon.

246
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,336
He said it.

247
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:43,807
Gang, it looks like we've got
another mystery on our hands.

248
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,187
This is where the Demon Rig disappeared.

249
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,655
Even the tire tracks.

250
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:58,190
They just stop.

251
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,059
Check this out.

252
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,093
According to this article,
the demon has appeared before.

253
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:09,501
<i>In the 1930s, there used to be races on
Marauder's Mountain in homemade hot rods.</i>

254
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:14,606
<i>During one event, an unknown racer appeared
out of nowhere to challenge them all.</i>

255
00:16:14,706 --> 00:16:16,406
<i>He was ruthless.</i>

256
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:21,610
<i>This mountain is mine!</i>

257
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:24,716
<i>But as he reached the top,</i>

258
00:16:24,816 --> 00:16:28,720
<i>he realized too late that
Deadman's Curve had washed away.</i>

259
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,522
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

260
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:31,922
<i>No!</i>

261
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:42,267
<i>They say you can still see
the racer to this day,</i>

262
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:45,936
cursed to forever haunt any attempts
to race on the mountain.

263
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:51,141
Why can't there ever be, like,
a comforting legend?

264
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:55,812
Hmm, what's this?

265
00:17:00,018 --> 00:17:01,320
Ugh!

266
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,388
This smells like rotten eggs.

267
00:17:03,488 --> 00:17:04,890
Ugh, horrible.

268
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,725
Ugh! Ew!

269
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:08,892
- Sniff.
- Really, Fred?

270
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,465
Sulfur, also called brimstone.

271
00:17:14,265 --> 00:17:17,166
A demonic substance,
if there ever was one.

272
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:21,140
Also a natural chemical
used in many smoke effects.

273
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,941
True, but boring.

274
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,409
Walter Qualls is my name.

275
00:17:24,509 --> 00:17:26,945
I'm the producer of the Muscle Moto X.

276
00:17:27,045 --> 00:17:29,414
Like, don't you produce
<i>Angry Shark Racers,</i>

277
00:17:29,514 --> 00:17:33,685
where contestants swim past angry sharks
wearing steak-covered wetsuits?

278
00:17:33,785 --> 00:17:36,155
All seven seasons.

279
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,657
You seem to like the idea
of the supernatural.

280
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,025
What's not to like?

281
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:43,095
I got WWE Superstars,
a million-dollar prize,

282
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:44,830
and now a demon's curse.

283
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,198
It's a producer's jackpot!

284
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:47,799
A 40 share.

285
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:50,669
So, could you take it easy
and not snoop so hard?

286
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,471
Let's keep this mystery alive.

287
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,707
Sorry. The only time we stop
is when the mystery is solved.

288
00:17:55,807 --> 00:17:57,535
Or we run away.

289
00:17:57,635 --> 00:18:01,213
I don't think Mr. McMahon would
appreciate you trying to hinder this case.

290
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:03,715
Me? Hinder? No.

291
00:18:03,815 --> 00:18:07,286
I'm just saying, demons are hot!
Zombies would be even better.

292
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,988
Ooh, maybe the demon is part zombie.

293
00:18:10,088 --> 00:18:11,957
Why don't you go down to the pit hanger

294
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:15,194
and ask the Superstars what they saw
of this zombie demon?

295
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:18,928
- No one said zombie.
- No one didn't say zombie.

296
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:28,574
Wow!

297
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:31,041
Superstars and super cars!

298
00:18:36,848 --> 00:18:39,384
They're checking out the engines
for tomorrow's race.

299
00:18:39,484 --> 00:18:42,020
Oh, man. I'd like
to check out a few myself.

300
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,258
I think we should split up and ask
if anyone saw anything unusual.

301
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:49,559
You mean, like, besides a demon racer?

302
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:52,898
- Huh?
- Huh?

303
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:56,768
The world is filled with surprises.

304
00:18:56,868 --> 00:18:58,503
Zoinks!

305
00:19:04,075 --> 00:19:06,945
- Like, no kidding.
- Huh?

306
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:13,752
You know, Scoob. We already
got one mystery on our hands.

307
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:15,554
We don't need two more.

308
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:16,922
Let's skedaddle.

309
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:18,590
And fast.

310
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,957
Okay, let's go.

311
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:23,128
A talking dog?

312
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:24,894
Bizarre.

313
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:32,271
Like, those dudes are like a bad toaster.

314
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:34,606
They pop up when you least expect it.

315
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:36,708
Well, I'll be...

316
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:39,778
You're the two that vanquished
the Ghost Bear.

317
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:41,413
Undertaker.

318
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,249
Scared, excited, same time.

319
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,051
Brain confused.

320
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:48,120
Skinny Man and Dead Meat, right?

321
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,488
Like, yeah.

322
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,723
But you can call us Shaggy and Scooby.

323
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:53,792
In fact, you can call us
anything you like.

324
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:58,096
But please don't call us to our final rest,
Mr. Undertaker-Phenom-Deadman, sir.

325
00:19:58,196 --> 00:19:59,963
Yeah.

326
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:04,834
The bell tolls only for the demon.

327
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,840
And you can just call me Taker.

328
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,644
You learn anything about that creature,
you let me know.

329
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:16,181
Scooby, Scooby, Scooby!

330
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,184
<i>Ole!</i>

331
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:22,487
Looks like you've got
another fan besides me.

332
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:29,194
We have no idea why a demon driver
or anyone would want to stop the race.

333
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:32,264
Maybe it's someone who's desperate
to get the prize money.

334
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:35,267
That would not be us, <i>mi querida senorita.</i>

335
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:39,171
We are in it for the honor
of the Matadors.

336
00:20:40,271 --> 00:20:43,975
What is that interesting scent
you assault my nostrils with?

337
00:20:44,775 --> 00:20:49,078
Sulfur. Looks like I've got
a mystery on my hands.

338
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,616
Hey, Triple H.

339
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:56,288
Fred, Daphne.

340
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:58,457
Do you know my wife, Stephanie?

341
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,158
Just by reputation.

342
00:21:00,258 --> 00:21:04,196
Daughter of Mr. McMahon and a champion
in the ring and the business world.

343
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:07,332
Also known as the Billion Dollar Princess.

344
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,701
Really? That's great.

345
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:11,136
I like your friends, Hunter.

346
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:15,040
And I love those classic Takemotos.

347
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,542
Thanks. Fashion for the girl of action.

348
00:21:17,642 --> 00:21:18,910
Daddy bought them.

349
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:20,645
A generous father.

350
00:21:20,745 --> 00:21:23,382
Looks like we have that in common, too.

351
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:25,984
We're actually helping your dad
on this demon case.

352
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:27,753
What do you know about the demon?

353
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:31,056
Only that he'd better not get
on Hunter's bad side.

354
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:33,024
If he knows what's good for him.

355
00:21:33,124 --> 00:21:35,761
Stephanie, I thought we decided
you weren't going to compete

356
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:38,063
because you had too much work to do.

357
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:43,368
And I told you I can think up
Muscle Moto X, plan it and win it.

358
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:46,738
No, Stephanie. You're doing too much,
and that's not safe.

359
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:49,708
- You're out.
- But I'm Hunter's racing partner.

360
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:53,745
Scooby, Scooby, Scooby, Scooby, Scooby!

361
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:55,548
Like...

362
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:58,497
<i>Ole!</i>

363
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,254
I'm sure I can find someone else.

364
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:04,356
You can't be serious.

365
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:08,059
Ladies and gentlemen,
dinner is now being served.

366
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:18,770
I think I'm suddenly allergic to dogs.

367
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:22,472
Don't worry, honey. He can't
take me out of the race that easily.

368
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:39,424
Like, Scooby-Doo, do you know
what you could buy with a million dollars?

369
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:43,595
A pepperoni pizza every day
for every meal for the rest of your life!

370
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,130
Extra-large?

371
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:48,098
Extra, extra-large.

372
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:56,141
So, the show goes on without a hitch, huh?

373
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:57,574
Why, of course it does.

374
00:22:58,743 --> 00:23:00,345
It figures.

375
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:02,180
Y'all better watch yourself.

376
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,749
It's more than that demon
that got old Dusty.

377
00:23:04,849 --> 00:23:06,318
It's the curse.

378
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:10,522
You can wrestle one,
but the other's the devil's work.

379
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:14,924
Don't expect this guy to care,
no matter how dangerous it gets.

380
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:18,196
Dusty!

381
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:22,267
Hmm, Mr. Rhodes sure seems
to have an ax to grind.

382
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:25,270
He wanted the prize money for his family.

383
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,305
I understand the feeling.

384
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:29,207
'Cause I guess I'm out, too.

385
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:31,843
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Let's not be hasty!

386
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:33,712
I'm sure there's something we can do.

387
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:37,215
He's good for five points in the ratings.
We need him.

388
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:39,682
You know who'd make
great teammates for Undertaker?

389
00:23:40,785 --> 00:23:43,521
Skinny Man and Dead Meat.

390
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:46,691
- Stephanie...
- That's brilliant!

391
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:50,695
Teaming Undertaker with a teenager
and a dog makes him an underdog.

392
00:23:50,795 --> 00:23:52,030
And people love underdogs.

393
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,464
And dogs! It's a win-win.

394
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,568
Yeah. A win-win.

395
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:58,401
You can thank me later.

396
00:24:00,905 --> 00:24:02,407
Skinny Man and Dead Meat.

397
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:04,142
How would you like to race
in Muscle Moto X with...

398
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:06,175
The Undertaker as your partner?

399
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:10,549
Partners? With the Undertaker?

400
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:13,151
I'm so scared and happy.

401
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:15,821
Uh-huh. "Scappy."

402
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:20,091
But what if the demon comes back?

403
00:24:20,191 --> 00:24:22,093
Like a nightmare.

404
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:26,231
There can only be
one nightmare in this race,

405
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:27,732
and that's me.

406
00:24:27,832 --> 00:24:31,403
Rest assured, if the demon appears again,

407
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:35,938
I'll make sure it's his last ride.

408
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:40,779
Let's join forces and win this race.

409
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:42,080
What do you say?

410
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:46,251
One nightmare canceling the other
is, like, a dream come true.

411
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:48,086
Here's to Team Taker.

412
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:50,689
Team Taker.

413
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:00,098
Ah, come on.

414
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:03,268
$300 for one darn textbook?

415
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:05,537
What's up, Earl?

416
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:09,439
My kids are going to college,
but I'm the one who's getting an education.

417
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:13,445
Everyone, this is Big Earl.

418
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:17,382
He customized all the cars,
including the Legendmobile.

419
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:18,583
Cool.

420
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:21,119
So where's my little beast?

421
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:23,653
I warn you, Undertaker. She ain't pretty.

422
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:28,493
It caught fire before we dug her out.

423
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:30,328
Gas line must've tore.

424
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:32,628
About all that's left
is your steering wheel here.

425
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:40,505
And, lo, the Legendmobile
sheds its mortal coil.

426
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:41,738
Rust...

427
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,306
in...

428
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,441
peace.

429
00:25:48,078 --> 00:25:50,915
Like, I guess, we can't race after all.

430
00:25:51,015 --> 00:25:53,151
You know, I could
give you a hand, Big Earl.

431
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:57,820
I've discovered I like wrenching,
as, uh, we car guys say.

432
00:25:58,456 --> 00:26:00,659
Mmm, okay.

433
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,694
You wanna help, that's great.

434
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:05,330
But I'm a mechanic, not a miracle worker.

435
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,864
How are we gonna make something
that runs outta this?

436
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,435
I have an idea.

437
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:13,171
Go get some rest and I promise
we'll have something by morning.

438
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:15,373
You guys work your magic.

439
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:18,307
If you build it, I will drive it.

440
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:21,279
Hey, what's all this powder?

441
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:22,847
Uh, who knows?

442
00:26:22,947 --> 00:26:26,151
Washing day for my coveralls
don't come round but twice a year.

443
00:26:27,251 --> 00:26:28,951
Hmm, it's not brimstone.

444
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:32,023
I think it's talcum powder.

445
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:35,627
Oh, yeah. It's from replacing
an airbag in one of the cars.

446
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:39,564
Do that a lot. They have powder in 'em
to keep 'em from getting bunched up.

447
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:43,201
Like, man, if any race
needs airbags, it's this one.

448
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:44,636
Come on, Hunter, it's late.

449
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:47,072
And we still need to get
our pre-race manicures.

450
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:49,040
Manicures?

451
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,675
You're welcome to join us.

452
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:54,245
After all, beautiful nails
lead to a happier life.

453
00:26:54,345 --> 00:26:56,214
I know, right?

454
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:58,648
- Really?
- Yes, really.

455
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,892
Come on, kid. Let's see what you got.

456
00:27:07,992 --> 00:27:09,225
Oh, boy!

457
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:48,366
<i>Welcome, WWE fans all across the world</i>

458
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:52,468
<i>to the first leg of the Muscle
Moto X Off Road Challenge.</i>

459
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,482
Moments from now,
your favorite WWE Superstars

460
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:09,254
will charge forward into the fearsome
Deadwood Forest.

461
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:13,124
<i>Our sky drone cameras are
ready to cover all the action.</i>

462
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:16,628
<i>Each Superstar team starts
in the order of their time-trial finish,</i>

463
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:18,463
<i>and the team that wins today</i>

464
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:20,498
<i>- gets a 30-second head start in leg two...</i>
- Ugh.

465
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:25,736
<i>...bringing them that much closer
to the $1 million prize.</i>

466
00:28:31,175 --> 00:28:32,477
<i>And this just in.</i>

467
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:34,813
<i>A last-minute change in the line-up.</i>

468
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:39,083
<i>The Undertaker teams with
Skinny Man and Dead Meat.</i>

469
00:28:39,183 --> 00:28:41,820
<i>It's team Taker in the Scoobanator.</i>

470
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:51,362
You'll love the new modifications.

471
00:28:51,462 --> 00:28:53,331
We bored it, rocked it,

472
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:55,798
and then we...

473
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:58,203
Dropped it hot!

474
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:01,472
Huh, I'm on no sleep.

475
00:29:01,572 --> 00:29:03,508
I appreciate the effort and all,

476
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:06,377
but isn't this a food truck?

477
00:29:06,477 --> 00:29:09,845
Yeah. It's like having
a drive-thru window drive with you.

478
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:13,051
Remember, Undertaker...

479
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:15,687
- Come on, Fred. Let's go.
- What?

480
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:17,355
Oh, yeah.

481
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:20,556
If you want more speed,
be sure to press the...

482
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:25,196
Hey, wait! Press the what?

483
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:27,298
Okay, folks. They're all lined up.

484
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:30,034
<i>Powerful, high-tech engines are humming.</i>

485
00:29:30,134 --> 00:29:33,838
<i>Pulses are pounding, excitement
is building, tensions are rising.</i>

486
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,840
<i>With $1 million up for grabs,</i>

487
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:40,578
<i>these WWE Superstars will pull
no punches to win it all.</i>

488
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:42,080
<i>Who will taste victory?</i>

489
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,648
<i>Who will suffer defeat?</i>

490
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:45,581
<i>It's anyone's game, folks.</i>

491
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:50,720
<i>And they're off!</i>

492
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:59,230
Move, beast! Ugh!

493
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:02,734
This racing roach-coach
is more like a dead weight.

494
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:04,602
Yeah. Look on the bright side.

495
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:06,204
Oh, man!

496
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,907
These are great seats to watch you race.

497
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:11,275
Go, Undertaker!

498
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:15,713
<i>Looks like Team Taker's
sandwich can't cut the mustard,</i>

499
00:30:15,813 --> 00:30:20,018
<i>but the rest of our competitors are rocking
it off-road and into the Deadwood Forest.</i>

500
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:21,619
<i>Let's get a closer look.</i>

501
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:25,590
It's your eye in the sky,
the man who can fly, Kofi Kingston,

502
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,626
<i>reporting to you from above the action.</i>

503
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:32,697
Looks like The Authority is wasting no time
in showing the others who's boss...

504
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:38,569
...and the Moscow Express is the first competitor
to take battle damage in today's race.

505
00:30:38,669 --> 00:30:40,936
But don't count Team Russia out yet.

506
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:43,141
Rusev fix.

507
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:45,743
<i>Da!</i> I will drive.

508
00:30:45,843 --> 00:30:47,779
<i>Each competitor is equipped
with magnetic boots</i>

509
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:50,312
<i>and tools to make repairs on the go.</i>

510
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:53,985
Magnetic boots?

511
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:56,587
This race just keeps
getting more exciting.

512
00:30:56,687 --> 00:31:01,259
Los Matadores are bringing the Pamplona
Especial alongside the Celtic Cruiser.

513
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,995
They may be planning something
<i>especial</i> themselves.

514
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:14,806
El Torito's small, but he's showing
both heart and horns today.

515
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:16,507
- <i>Ole!</i>
- <i>Ole!</i>

516
00:31:16,607 --> 00:31:20,778
<i>Torito may not be steering, but I bet
his distraction drove Sheamus crazy.</i>

517
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:24,915
Argh. Now you've got me Irish up.

518
00:31:26,617 --> 00:31:31,087
Argh. Why don't you
two fellas just get lost?

519
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:35,827
Keep it together, Sheamus.

520
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:37,628
Just keep it together.

521
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:40,531
<i>The Authority holds the lead,
but it's still early.</i>

522
00:31:40,631 --> 00:31:43,835
- <i>Anything can happen.</i>
- The Company Car's leading!

523
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:46,037
Whoo! Go, Stephanie!

524
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:49,173
You know Shaggy and Scooby
are also in this race.

525
00:31:49,273 --> 00:31:51,843
I can have more than one favorite.

526
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:53,878
By definition, no.

527
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:57,682
<i>These supercars are demolishing
this off-road course.</i>

528
00:31:57,782 --> 00:32:00,852
Except for The Scoobanator.

529
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:05,354
<i>Each of these amazing vehicles has been
designed to withstand any obstacle.</i>

530
00:32:06,757 --> 00:32:08,524
Except for The Scoobanator, Michael.

531
00:32:13,397 --> 00:32:16,968
This rig is 10 pounds of bolts
in a five-pound bucket.

532
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:18,870
This race is cursed.

533
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:23,307
<i>Team Taker won't be counted out,
but they're struggling to build momentum.</i>

534
00:32:23,407 --> 00:32:26,144
Looks like The Authority
is losing momentum.

535
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:29,378
I'd take the lead if I were driving,
but I'm awesome.

536
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:33,584
The crazy Russians hit us again.

537
00:32:33,684 --> 00:32:36,487
I'd dodge them if I were driving,
but I'm awesome.

538
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:39,557
You know what you need? Mentoring.

539
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:41,593
Oh.

540
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:44,095
<i>The Too Awesome and Moscow
Express docking for second,</i>

541
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:46,428
<i>while the Company Car dominates the game!</i>

542
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,241
Oh, no. The Demon Rig has returned.

543
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:04,348
- I'm goin' in close, Michael.
- <i>Careful, Kofi.</i>

544
00:33:04,448 --> 00:33:06,184
<i>You're at the most dangerous
part of the course.</i>

545
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:08,284
<i>The old Deadwood Bridge.</i>

546
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:15,760
This race is doomed.

547
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:21,430
All those who oppose Inferno will perish!

548
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:24,266
Whoa!

549
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,273
Inferno's got some serious heat.

550
00:33:29,373 --> 00:33:31,407
He's tryin' to burn down the whole race.

551
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:35,110
Go! Go! Go!

552
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,586
Look at 'em go, folks!

553
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,555
Facing the fire of a supernatural specter.

554
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:46,958
<i>That's why they call them Superstars.</i>

555
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:49,026
<i>What bravery!</i>

556
00:33:50,126 --> 00:33:52,427
I'm too young to fry!

557
00:33:56,033 --> 00:33:57,802
Great driving, Hunter.

558
00:33:57,902 --> 00:34:01,171
Triple H is leading
the charge past Inferno.

559
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,010
<i>Now the demon is after the Company Car.</i>

560
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,079
<i>How's he driving, Kofi?</i>

561
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,314
I don't know, but it doesn't
look good for Team Authority.

562
00:34:10,414 --> 00:34:12,249
I'm trying to get in closer to them.

563
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,149
Whoa!

564
00:34:18,993 --> 00:34:21,592
<i>My drones don't seem to want to be
anywhere near that demon.</i>

565
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:23,361
Nor do your jammers.

566
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:26,430
The curse of the demon must be
interfering with the signal, too.

567
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:28,366
<i>The horror. The horror!</i>

568
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:32,136
<i>Oh, no! Not the scorpion tail again!</i>

569
00:34:32,836 --> 00:34:35,606
Poor Stephanie!
She just had her hair done this morning.

570
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:38,943
You'd think her father
would be watching this.

571
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:41,679
He hasn't even been on any
of the production cams.

572
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,683
Fred, pay attention.

573
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:48,285
Push the red button on the dash!

574
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:52,023
Zoinks! Fire.

575
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:53,355
Fire!

576
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:55,526
Don't worry.

577
00:34:55,626 --> 00:35:00,198
The Undertaker does not fear the flame.

578
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:02,399
But we do!

579
00:35:05,569 --> 00:35:07,405
By thunder and lightning!

580
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:09,707
That's what Fred was trying to say.

581
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:12,043
We got boosters!

582
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:16,047
<i>Oh, my!
Deadwood Bridge is shattering apart!</i>

583
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:18,647
<i>Team Taker is in real trouble here.</i>

584
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:32,563
- Woo-hoo! Man, way to go, guys!
- Scoobanator! Yay! Scooby-Doo!

585
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:35,399
I cannot believe what I'm seeing.

586
00:35:35,499 --> 00:35:40,338
<i>Only the Undertaker could fly
a sandwich out of the jaws of oblivion.</i>

587
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:43,207
There's that yellow-bellied demon.

588
00:35:45,609 --> 00:35:46,909
- Inferno!
- Inferno!

589
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,749
- Smoke!
- Smoke!

590
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:57,419
Where did he go?

591
00:36:00,224 --> 00:36:02,024
- Mountain!
- Mountain!

592
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:04,927
Whoa!

593
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:10,268
<i>Unbelievable!</i>

594
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,500
<i>But where did Inferno go?</i>

595
00:36:14,171 --> 00:36:15,906
Company Car's through!

596
00:36:16,006 --> 00:36:18,442
Here comes the Pamplona Especial.

597
00:36:18,542 --> 00:36:20,244
No sign of the Demon Rig.

598
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,480
Wait. It's... It's...

599
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,048
The Scoobanator!

600
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:34,058
<i>And the first leg of Muscle Moto X
finishes with The Authority in first place,</i>

601
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:37,626
<i>Team Taker in second
and Los Matadores in third.</i>

602
00:36:40,332 --> 00:36:45,303
<i>Join us again tomorrow for
the next round of the Muscle Moto X.</i>

603
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:47,736
<i>Hopefully, no more spooky stuff happens.</i>

604
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:53,811
Where did you fellas go?

605
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:56,614
It's not where we went that matters...

606
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:59,617
It's where we come from.

607
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:13,530
Huh, burrito, burrito!

608
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,363
Burrito, burrito!

609
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:20,805
You have to be pleased
with your performance,

610
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,841
<i>especially with the appearance
of this Demon Rig.</i>

611
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:26,177
<i>Are you concerned the race may be cursed?</i>

612
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:27,779
<i>Mark my words, Michael.</i>

613
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:31,182
<i>No demon or devil or any other
ghoul will interfere with my race.</i>

614
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:34,685
<i>We'll take him out and then
we will take the championship.</i>

615
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:38,889
<i>Just like we took the 30-second
head start for today's win.</i>

616
00:37:38,989 --> 00:37:40,556
<i>Second to last place!</i>

617
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:43,027
<i>Pathetic.</i>

618
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:44,962
<i>You should wear pink, frilly dresses</i>

619
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:48,032
<i>so the people know you're
not the Russian champion,</i>

620
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:52,403
<i>but a little bunny-man masquerading
as the Russian champion.</i>

621
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:54,805
Nyet! Nyet! <i>Lies!</i>

622
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:58,309
<i>Rusev not take you to
the outlet mall this weekend.</i>

623
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:00,711
<i>Okay.</i>

624
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:04,715
<i>Undertaker, your team took second place
today, using a modified food truck.</i>

625
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:06,250
<i>That's truly amazing.</i>

626
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:09,653
<i>Dark forces lashed out against us.</i>

627
00:38:09,753 --> 00:38:13,824
<i>The flames of Inferno
tried to swallow us whole,</i>

628
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:18,362
<i>but the bell tolls not for Team Taker,</i>

629
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:22,032
<i>it tolls for the demon.</i>

630
00:38:23,133 --> 00:38:25,836
<i>Oh, are those McMahon's Mania Meatballs?</i>

631
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:28,105
- <i>Meatballs?</i>
- <i>Meatballs?</i>

632
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:31,709
<i>I see you're lacking an A-List talent
to train your camera on, Kofi.</i>

633
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,711
<i>Lucky for you, I'm here.</i>

634
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:36,380
<i>And yes, I am disappointed in my team.</i>

635
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,417
<i>Paige was beyond terrible.</i>

636
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:42,052
<i>I'd give her a grade of poor-minus.</i>

637
00:38:42,152 --> 00:38:44,588
<i>You're blaming me? You did nothing.</i>

638
00:38:44,688 --> 00:38:46,190
<i>Wrong-o!</i>

639
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:49,360
<i>First, I was performing like a champion,</i>

640
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:53,898
<i>B, I was gracing this event
with my style and credibility,</i>

641
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,600
<i>and thirdly, I tried mentoring you,</i>

642
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:01,138
<i>but you didn't listen to any
of my excellent advice.</i>

643
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:04,475
<i>Hmm. You make several fascinating points.</i>

644
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:07,444
<i>Then let me show you my appreciation.</i>

645
00:39:10,814 --> 00:39:12,082
<i>Aw.</i>

646
00:39:12,182 --> 00:39:15,485
- <i>I wanted thirdsies.</i>
- <i>Rusev crush!</i>

647
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:26,828
<i>Bad move!</i>

648
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:40,243
- <i>Ole!</i>
- <i>Ole!</i>

649
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,982
Like, maybe we should order take-out.

650
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:48,285
What in the name of Gorgeous George
is going on here?

651
00:39:48,385 --> 00:39:50,085
Brogue Kicks for everybody.

652
00:39:54,758 --> 00:39:56,293
I'm gonna lose my deposit.

653
00:39:56,393 --> 00:39:59,096
I will not be partner
with girly man Rusev.

654
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:01,832
Me. Me next! I need attention.

655
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:03,834
Paige has no respect for my greatness.

656
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:05,135
I won't race with her.

657
00:40:05,235 --> 00:40:07,104
I want new partner, too.

658
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:08,754
That goes triple for me,

659
00:40:08,854 --> 00:40:12,977
'cause I can't be paired with a man
who uses more hair product than I do.

660
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:17,047
Uh, before you do anything rash, here are
the spot ratings for the first race.

661
00:40:17,147 --> 00:40:21,350
And controversy like this
will mean they'll only get bigger!

662
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:23,621
Fine.

663
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:25,856
Lana and Paige are now in Too Awesome.

664
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:28,826
Miz joins the Moscow Express with Rusev.

665
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,995
Really? He smells like borscht.

666
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,297
Well, if you don't like the sound
of getting a new partner,

667
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:38,002
perhaps you'll like the sound
of me saying, "You're fired!"

668
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,368
Sorry, boss. Won't happen again.

669
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:47,077
Let's go, you two.

670
00:40:47,177 --> 00:40:49,880
Can we go someplace, like, less fighty?

671
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,082
And more foody?

672
00:40:52,482 --> 00:40:55,885
Who's "Too Awesome" now? Not you.

673
00:40:57,454 --> 00:40:59,056
Kidding about the borscht!

674
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:01,392
Grammy Gram makes it every leap year.

675
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:03,594
Does anyone else want to trade partners?

676
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:05,529
Anyone at all?

677
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:09,833
And so, one turns against the other.

678
00:41:09,933 --> 00:41:12,236
Brothers against sisters.

679
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:14,572
Divisions in the ranks.

680
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:16,240
Trust me, boys,

681
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:20,242
the curse of the demon is only starting.

682
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:25,749
I thought tonight we could
go over some clues,

683
00:41:25,849 --> 00:41:28,919
that is, if Fred ever
emerges from his coma.

684
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:30,521
I didn't take your doll.

685
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:32,456
Huh? Oh. What?

686
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:34,592
Actually, Stephanie wanted
to talk to me this evening

687
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:37,695
about employment opportunities
with the WWE.

688
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:40,397
- To do what?
- Wrestle-wear designer.

689
00:41:40,497 --> 00:41:43,100
She thinks I have
a natural gift for spandex.

690
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,771
Far be it from me to interfere with
the baroness' big business plans.

691
00:41:47,871 --> 00:41:50,474
Mmm, I don't know why you're
so judgmental about Stephanie.

692
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:51,809
She's really sweet.

693
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:53,811
She even said nice things about you.

694
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:55,412
Like what?

695
00:41:55,512 --> 00:41:57,448
Well, she thought
you'd make a great Superstar.

696
00:41:57,548 --> 00:42:01,650
She said you're just the type
fans love to see get slammed.

697
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,619
It was a compliment.

698
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:07,657
Are you ready, Daphne?

699
00:42:07,757 --> 00:42:09,757
You don't know how ready.

700
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:26,942
- Shaggy. Donut me.
- One donut coming up.

701
00:42:29,379 --> 00:42:32,149
- Zoinks.
- Is it Inferno?

702
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:35,119
Worse. We are out of snacks.

703
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,521
Like, I can't sleep on
a partially empty stomach.

704
00:42:37,621 --> 00:42:40,124
- Can you?
- Uh-uh.

705
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,858
The Scoobanator!

706
00:43:01,411 --> 00:43:03,013
Dude. Check it out.

707
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:06,848
Enchiladas with tuna fish,
yogurt and chocolate sauce.

708
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,654
And fried onions.

709
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,621
Good thing I made two.

710
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:17,661
Scooby-Doo.

711
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,863
- Did you just clank?
- Uh-uh.

712
00:43:19,963 --> 00:43:21,830
Not me.

713
00:43:28,622 --> 00:43:30,756
- Inferno!
- Inferno!

714
00:43:32,175 --> 00:43:35,512
You will pay for your meddling.

715
00:43:35,612 --> 00:43:38,380
Like, how about we leave now
and pay later?

716
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:52,394
Yikes!

717
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:54,998
Who's awesome? I'm awesome.

718
00:43:55,098 --> 00:43:56,834
Who's awesome? I'm awesome.

719
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:59,269
Who's awesome? I'm awesome.

720
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:14,051
Strangely enough, I've been
monster-mauled on a midnight jog before.

721
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:16,920
But this time, I'm doing the mauling.

722
00:44:22,392 --> 00:44:23,592
- Yay!
- Yay!

723
00:44:43,547 --> 00:44:45,313
Ooh. Cool!

724
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:56,224
The demon.

725
00:44:58,896 --> 00:45:01,196
- The Miz has him!
- Go, Miz!

726
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:23,153
None can defeat Inferno.

727
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:26,821
Your fate will soon be sealed.

728
00:45:34,765 --> 00:45:36,200
Gone again.

729
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:39,469
He overpowered my awesome
Figure Four Leglock?

730
00:45:39,569 --> 00:45:43,073
Oh, no. Could it be that
the curse of Inferno

731
00:45:43,173 --> 00:45:45,742
is making you lose your awesome?

732
00:45:46,042 --> 00:45:49,279
I... I can lose my awesome?

733
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:51,849
Like we lost our appetites.

734
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:56,151
What I'd like to know is what Inferno
was doing here in the first place.

735
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:07,564
The only damage I could find was
that the Company Car's oil line was cut.

736
00:46:07,664 --> 00:46:10,198
Without oil, the engine would have
seized up for sure during the race.

737
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:12,202
Hmm.

738
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:13,670
What about the other cars?

739
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:15,505
They all checked out okay.

740
00:46:15,605 --> 00:46:17,307
Great work, guys.

741
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:20,210
You stopped the demon before
it could sabotage the other cars.

742
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:21,578
- We did?
- We did?

743
00:46:21,678 --> 00:46:24,248
Oh, we did.

744
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:27,150
Look! Here's more of that talcum powder.

745
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:28,852
I can tell you where that came from.

746
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:30,754
Our airbags.

747
00:46:30,854 --> 00:46:33,056
I checked them out this afternoon,
right after the race.

748
00:46:33,156 --> 00:46:35,392
Gotta protect my precious cargo.

749
00:46:35,492 --> 00:46:37,594
He left a track.

750
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:40,063
Ew! Someone needs a pedicure.

751
00:46:40,163 --> 00:46:42,499
Stephanie, I wish you'd reconsider this.

752
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:45,335
There's a good chance
Inferno might attack tomorrow.

753
00:46:45,435 --> 00:46:48,770
Well, I hope he does,
because tomorrow, I'm driving.

754
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:04,721
Welcome to Race Two of the Muscle
Moto X Off Road Challenge.

755
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:08,058
We're calling it the Spire Lake Sprint.

756
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:11,726
The Authority won the first race,
so they get a 30-second head start.

757
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:19,267
So long, suckers!

758
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:25,475
While we're waiting,
let's go to Kofi Kingston.

759
00:47:25,575 --> 00:47:27,978
Lana's with Paige in Too Awesome.

760
00:47:28,078 --> 00:47:31,112
While the Miz joins Rusev
in the Moscow Express.

761
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:36,053
Really?

762
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:39,056
I love our girl power team-up.

763
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:41,992
Yeah. I can feel your enthusiasm.

764
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:44,893
I can't wait to see
how these new teams turn out.

765
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:51,435
<i>And there they go!</i>

766
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:54,137
- Hmm, that's strange.
- What?

767
00:47:54,237 --> 00:47:56,004
Mr. McMahon is leaving.

768
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:01,979
You'd think he'd stay
to watch what happens.

769
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,314
<i>To overcome yesterday's last-place finish,</i>

770
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:07,818
<i>Sheamus, Goldust and Stardust
will have to work together.</i>

771
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:11,621
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

772
00:48:11,721 --> 00:48:16,326
How we wonder where you are.

773
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:22,766
How about you two mad weirdos
get out of my head

774
00:48:22,866 --> 00:48:25,502
and into our competitors'...

775
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:27,838
Dead creepy the way
those two fellas do that.

776
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:30,007
<i>The road to victory is a bumpy ride,</i>

777
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:32,874
<i>but it looks like our Superstars
are running out of road.</i>

778
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:35,379
Where are they going?

779
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:36,845
<i>They're headed toward that cliff.</i>

780
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:44,855
<i>Oh, my. You can lead these horses to
water, but you can't make them sink.</i>

781
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:48,959
<i>Because these Superstars
can drive on water.</i>

782
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:52,362
<i>When we named it the Muscle
Moto X Off Road Challenge,</i>

783
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:53,862
<i>we weren't kidding, folks.</i>

784
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:58,032
Like, good thing these come with floaties.

785
00:49:06,009 --> 00:49:11,048
<i>Look at 'em hit the drink,
like steel leviathans thirsty for victory.</i>

786
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:14,551
That's right, Michael. And while
The Authority held the advantage on land,

787
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:17,254
Team Taker is closing the gap
on the water.

788
00:49:17,354 --> 00:49:21,725
The Spire Lake Sprint could be a real
game-changer for these Superstars.

789
00:49:21,825 --> 00:49:24,225
- <i>Mas rapido.</i>
- Go for it, Torito!

790
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:39,543
I had my doubts about this partnership,
Rusev, but look at us. We're doing great!

791
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,678
You driving and me being awesome.

792
00:49:41,778 --> 00:49:43,278
Little man talk too much.

793
00:49:47,684 --> 00:49:50,921
Step on it! Cut your turns
closer and pass.

794
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:54,091
Hey! Are you holding back
so Rusev can win?

795
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:56,226
Ha! Yes!

796
00:49:56,326 --> 00:50:00,931
For the glory of Mother Russia,
I will make sure Rusev is champion.

797
00:50:01,031 --> 00:50:03,097
You two-faced...

798
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:05,099
Huh?

799
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:11,541
Oh, my!

800
00:50:11,641 --> 00:50:13,710
He's back, folks. The demon from the deep.

801
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:16,646
<i>And now our Superstars are in hot water!</i>

802
00:50:16,746 --> 00:50:17,948
You said it, Michael.

803
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:20,050
Inferno set the last race on fire.

804
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:22,483
No doubt he'll bring
this water race to a boil.

805
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:24,819
Wow!

806
00:50:29,258 --> 00:50:30,746
Inferno!

807
00:50:30,846 --> 00:50:32,462
<i>This Demon Rig is unstoppable!</i>

808
00:50:32,562 --> 00:50:34,564
It's after the Celtic Cruiser.

809
00:50:35,264 --> 00:50:37,968
The Demon Rig. Bit of nice machinery there.

810
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:40,103
Got nothing on the Celtic Cruiser, though.

811
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:45,942
<i>What power!</i>

812
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:50,580
<i>The Celtic Cruiser flung
like a flaccid flapjack.</i>

813
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:53,583
Argh! I swear, by me sainted mother,

814
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:56,651
one way or another,
I'm gonna beat that Inferno.

815
00:50:59,856 --> 00:51:02,659
It'll take more than that
to knock down the Celtic Warrior.

816
00:51:02,759 --> 00:51:04,161
But what about the Too Awesome?

817
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:05,927
And the Pamplona Especial?

818
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:08,798
Ah!

819
00:51:08,898 --> 00:51:10,634
Such power.

820
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:13,803
With demon vehicle,
victory would be assured.

821
00:51:13,903 --> 00:51:17,772
Could you please stop admiring
the thing that's smashing us to pieces?

822
00:51:18,441 --> 00:51:19,843
Lana!

823
00:51:19,943 --> 00:51:21,309
I save you!

824
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:25,448
No, no, no. What are you doing?

825
00:51:25,548 --> 00:51:27,184
You're going the wrong way.

826
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:31,021
<i>Rusev just sacrificed
his third-place position.</i>

827
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:34,024
Which saved Lana and Paige
from certain doom.

828
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:35,857
Now that's a Superstar.

829
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:44,367
<i>Oh, no. Inferno is gaining
on the leaders now.</i>

830
00:51:44,467 --> 00:51:47,202
The demon is after the Company Car.

831
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:50,740
Keep driving, Steph.

832
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:53,641
It's time for me to do
what's best for business.

833
00:52:00,984 --> 00:52:03,052
You wanna play games?

834
00:52:05,155 --> 00:52:07,488
I am The Game.

835
00:52:13,096 --> 00:52:14,831
Triple H has a score to settle, Michael.

836
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:17,567
He leaves Stephanie
to face his demon, literally.

837
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:20,070
<i>The King of Kings
versus the demon of the derby.</i>

838
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:21,671
<i>It's a fight in the fast lane.</i>

839
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:23,840
<i>The stakes have never been higher.</i>

840
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:26,109
<i>And it looks like Triple H is done for.</i>

841
00:52:26,209 --> 00:52:28,242
<i>Great Gobbledy Gooker!</i>

842
00:52:32,015 --> 00:52:33,214
<i>He's safe!</i>

843
00:52:33,883 --> 00:52:37,587
<i>Triple H was in trouble,
but Stephanie came back for him.</i>

844
00:52:37,787 --> 00:52:40,724
Go, Authority! Nice driving, Steph!

845
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:43,560
So, she can turn a wheel. Big deal.

846
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:44,928
<i>It's not over yet, folks.</i>

847
00:52:45,028 --> 00:52:47,097
<i>The clash of the titans continues.</i>

848
00:52:47,197 --> 00:52:49,266
<i>But this Demon Rig is undefeated.</i>

849
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:52,902
<i>There's no way The Authority
can withstand these brutal attacks.</i>

850
00:52:53,002 --> 00:52:56,604
<i>We may be witnessing
the end of the Muscle Moto X!</i>

851
00:52:58,608 --> 00:53:01,043
<i>Team Taker out of nowhere!</i>

852
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,280
Forget about me?

853
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,079
Big mistake.

854
00:53:12,055 --> 00:53:14,291
Like, is this part of the race?

855
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:16,293
It is now.

856
00:53:16,393 --> 00:53:19,496
<i>I never thought I'd be
so happy to see a sandwich truck</i>

857
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:23,333
<i>and a vintage Undertaker
surprise return on the side.</i>

858
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:25,500
<i>What an emotional roller-coaster.</i>

859
00:53:29,189 --> 00:53:30,766
Huh?

860
00:53:31,388 --> 00:53:34,844
Things just took a turn
for the worst, Michael.

861
00:53:34,944 --> 00:53:38,581
The demon just rammed
Team Taker out of the race.

862
00:53:38,681 --> 00:53:40,183
<i>But that was just the appetizer.</i>

863
00:53:40,283 --> 00:53:42,919
<i>He's about to unleash the main course.</i>

864
00:53:51,761 --> 00:53:54,565
The Scoobanator's been hit.

865
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:56,478
<i>The sun may be shining,</i>

866
00:53:56,578 --> 00:54:00,302
<i>but the day could not be darker
for these Superstars.</i>

867
00:54:01,304 --> 00:54:03,671
Uh-oh. Not good.

868
00:54:08,611 --> 00:54:09,911
Oh, no!

869
00:54:10,011 --> 00:54:13,483
Just when I thought things
couldn't get worse for Team Taker.

870
00:54:16,786 --> 00:54:18,453
Everyone, in the back!

871
00:54:20,457 --> 00:54:22,557
Hang on, Michael.
I'm gonna see if I can help.

872
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:29,664
Whoa! I can't steer!

873
00:54:38,107 --> 00:54:42,005
- Oh, good. The camera still works.
- <i>Keep us posted, Kofi.</i>

874
00:54:42,105 --> 00:54:44,714
<i>Meanwhile, our sky drone cameras
are still following the race.</i>

875
00:54:44,814 --> 00:54:48,852
<i>The water course has reached its end.</i>
<i>It's time for the surf to return to the turf.</i>

876
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:52,222
<i>Our waterlogged racecars once again
put rubber to the road.</i>

877
00:54:52,322 --> 00:54:56,359
<i>Coming into the home stretch, we've got
the Company Car and Pamplona Especial</i>

878
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:57,894
<i>wrestling for the lead position.</i>

879
00:54:57,994 --> 00:55:00,029
<i>The foal and the boss are neck-and-neck.</i>

880
00:55:00,129 --> 00:55:02,265
<i>And as they approach the finish line,</i>

881
00:55:02,365 --> 00:55:05,702
<i>the Company Car's
in first place by a headlight.</i>

882
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:09,773
It wins the big head start
for the all-important final race tomorrow.

883
00:55:09,873 --> 00:55:11,775
<i>That's not the big story, Michael.</i>

884
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:14,077
Team Taker's going down.

885
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:16,112
And I mean, way down.

886
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:20,049
Jinkies!

887
00:55:20,149 --> 00:55:23,019
There's gotta be something
in here that can help us.

888
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:27,023
At least we're surrounded by all
the things we love, Scooby-Doo!

889
00:55:27,123 --> 00:55:29,092
Gosh. Yeah.

890
00:55:29,192 --> 00:55:30,958
It's not over yet.

891
00:55:32,195 --> 00:55:35,565
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

892
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:37,932
Team Taker goes over the falls!

893
00:55:42,805 --> 00:55:44,238
<i>Oh, the humanity!</i>

894
00:55:49,145 --> 00:55:50,647
Kofi, do you see anything?

895
00:55:50,747 --> 00:55:52,615
<i>Anything at all?</i>

896
00:55:52,715 --> 00:55:53,915
I don't know, Michael.

897
00:55:55,084 --> 00:55:56,450
<i>I don't think anyone could...</i>

898
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:59,753
<i>Wait. Wait!</i>

899
00:56:01,991 --> 00:56:03,426
They made it!

900
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:05,595
The Undertaker saves
Skinny Man and Dead Meat.

901
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:07,895
Salvation by sausage wings, Michael.

902
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:19,943
This Inferno is getting more dangerous,
and we're still not any closer

903
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:21,744
to figuring out who he really is.

904
00:56:21,844 --> 00:56:24,414
- There's still Mr. McMahon.
- And Big Earl.

905
00:56:24,514 --> 00:56:27,016
Big Earl? But he's so nice.

906
00:56:27,116 --> 00:56:30,484
He needs money.
Maybe he's getting paid to do two jobs.

907
00:56:36,426 --> 00:56:39,462
Despite this criminal demon,
we've come too far to quit now.

908
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,598
So the race is on!

909
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:45,634
Tomorrow, we award a million dollars,
and any of you can still win!

910
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:49,305
Yippee! Woo-hoo!

911
00:56:49,405 --> 00:56:50,507
Bring it on!

912
00:56:50,607 --> 00:56:53,643
Yeah. Anyone with a car.

913
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:55,443
Sorry, Undertaker.

914
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,680
It's just...

915
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:00,783
I was racing for all my little
creatures of the night.

916
00:57:00,883 --> 00:57:03,853
The little Undertaker fans
all across the world.

917
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:06,823
I was gonna use my share
of the prize money

918
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:12,660
to create the Undertaker's
Comedy Theater and Puppet Jubilee.

919
00:57:16,566 --> 00:57:18,065
I like puppets.

920
00:57:20,737 --> 00:57:22,739
As the winners in the last race,

921
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:27,510
The Authority gets another
30-second head start in the final race.

922
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:30,244
Let's have a big hand for us!

923
00:57:33,816 --> 00:57:36,719
No reason to be sore losers. Losers.

924
00:57:36,819 --> 00:57:40,390
Nobody's lost yet, but this whole thing
smells like a stinkin' angle

925
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:42,358
that seems to favor just one team.

926
00:57:42,458 --> 00:57:45,194
Hey! We're victims, just like you.

927
00:57:45,294 --> 00:57:49,933
We won today because we're that darn good.

928
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:52,769
And we're that darn disgusted.

929
00:57:52,869 --> 00:57:57,040
Twice the demon shows up
and twice you win a head start.

930
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,709
Coincidence? Don't think so.

931
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:01,444
- <i>Ole.</i>
- <i>Ole.</i>

932
00:58:01,544 --> 00:58:04,414
The cosmic tea leaves have soured.

933
00:58:04,514 --> 00:58:05,949
Never more.

934
00:58:06,049 --> 00:58:08,117
Never more.

935
00:58:08,217 --> 00:58:11,354
Fine. Hunter and I will beat you
without the head start.

936
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:14,390
See you at the races, suckers.

937
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:16,923
Haters.

938
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:22,265
I hope you guys are close
to solving this thing.

939
00:58:22,365 --> 00:58:24,934
Uh, we do have one question, Mr. McMahon.

940
00:58:25,034 --> 00:58:27,236
Just where do you go during the races?

941
00:58:27,336 --> 00:58:29,606
What... Now I'm a suspect?

942
00:58:29,706 --> 00:58:33,409
I do have a few things to do,
like running the entire WWE.

943
00:58:33,509 --> 00:58:36,245
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to leave.

944
00:58:36,345 --> 00:58:39,313
And I'm fully aware this may
seem suspicious, but it's not.

945
00:58:40,817 --> 00:58:43,784
Right. Not suspicious at all.

946
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:49,792
Don't take it too hard, Stephanie.

947
00:58:49,892 --> 00:58:52,629
I know what other people think
when you have a successful father.

948
00:58:52,729 --> 00:58:54,297
Sometimes it's not great.

949
00:58:54,397 --> 00:58:56,733
My father would never hand us a win.

950
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:59,602
He works us hard because we're family,

951
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:03,339
and I have to work even harder
than anyone to impress him.

952
00:59:03,439 --> 00:59:07,944
My dad is a wealthy businessman, too,
but I don't think I could ever work for him.

953
00:59:08,844 --> 00:59:13,483
There's a difference between
millions and billions, honey.

954
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:14,949
Uh, what?

955
00:59:15,785 --> 00:59:17,186
Daphne, I'm sorry.

956
00:59:17,286 --> 00:59:20,020
It's just this race, it's so frustrating.

957
00:59:29,932 --> 00:59:33,503
So basically she said,
"My dad is richer than your dad"?

958
00:59:33,603 --> 00:59:35,638
Well, she said she was sorry after.

959
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:38,508
These Superstar Divas have been
known to turn on each other.

960
00:59:38,608 --> 00:59:40,343
You better be prepared, Daphne.

961
00:59:40,443 --> 00:59:44,280
Before this is over, Miss Bossy
McRustlepants might unfriend you.

962
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:49,052
That's fine, she's not
my best friend, you are.

963
00:59:49,152 --> 00:59:51,888
Good. Because if we're gonna
solve this mystery,

964
00:59:51,988 --> 00:59:54,555
there's no one I'd rather
solve it with than you.

965
01:00:09,806 --> 01:00:11,207
<i>Ole!</i>

966
01:00:11,307 --> 01:00:16,143
Like, with the Scoobanator gone,
we can finally kick back and relax.

967
01:00:16,612 --> 01:00:20,249
Yup. No more racing for us.

968
01:00:22,485 --> 01:00:24,987
- Inferno!
- Lock the doors!

969
01:00:25,655 --> 01:00:27,521
<i>Oh, que padre!</i>

970
01:00:28,825 --> 01:00:29,890
- Huh?
- Huh?

971
01:00:35,331 --> 01:00:36,332
Look what we did.

972
01:00:36,432 --> 01:00:38,101
Isn't it great?

973
01:00:38,201 --> 01:00:40,000
We're back in the game.

974
01:00:49,045 --> 01:00:51,881
<i>If you thought yesterday's
water race was over-the-top,</i>

975
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:54,383
you haven't seen anything yet.

976
01:00:54,483 --> 01:00:56,552
<i>Today, we finish where we started,</i>

977
01:00:56,652 --> 01:01:00,857
<i>heading up the dangerous Marauder's
Mountain to the infamous Deadman's Curve</i>

978
01:01:00,957 --> 01:01:04,627
<i>before parachuting back
to our original starting line.</i>

979
01:01:04,727 --> 01:01:10,066
<i>This is the final leg of the Muscle
Moto X Off Road Challenge!</i>

980
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:12,802
With The Authority forfeiting
their 30-second lead,

981
01:01:12,902 --> 01:01:16,539
the million dollar prize
is truly up for grabs.

982
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:18,606
Oh, my!

983
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:21,878
Like, we're all going?

984
01:01:21,978 --> 01:01:24,480
That's right. We're gonna win this race

985
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:28,951
and deliver that demon
back to the dark side.

986
01:01:29,051 --> 01:01:31,254
We discovered a big clue, Shaggy.

987
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:35,625
Remember how Kofi's drones weirded out
when he got close to the Demon Rig?

988
01:01:35,725 --> 01:01:36,790
<i>I can't steer!</i>

989
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:40,062
It happened in the first race, too.

990
01:01:40,162 --> 01:01:42,765
Those drones are set
to specific frequencies.

991
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:45,601
They get disrupted if a different
signal crosses with it.

992
01:01:45,701 --> 01:01:48,638
So it makes sense that someone,
at least some of the time,

993
01:01:48,738 --> 01:01:51,741
is driving the Demon Rig
by remote control.

994
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:56,612
This time, when Inferno shows, we're gonna
override his signal and stop him cold.

995
01:01:56,712 --> 01:01:58,481
Buckle your belts, kids.

996
01:01:58,581 --> 01:02:01,782
The Speed Demon's smackdown
is about to begin.

997
01:02:06,522 --> 01:02:08,591
<i>And they're off!</i>

998
01:02:08,691 --> 01:02:11,994
<i>The question on everyone's mind,
will Team Taker's new Mystery Machine</i>

999
01:02:12,094 --> 01:02:13,696
<i>help them win Marauder's Mountain?</i>

1000
01:02:13,796 --> 01:02:15,998
<i>The answer will be hammered
out of our Superstars</i>

1001
01:02:16,098 --> 01:02:19,335
<i>by the most brutal
and dangerous course of them all.</i>

1002
01:02:19,435 --> 01:02:21,604
<i>I hope you did the laundry, folks,</i>

1003
01:02:21,704 --> 01:02:24,171
<i>because you're gonna need a clean
pair of pants at the end this one.</i>

1004
01:02:29,211 --> 01:02:32,112
You know, I'm beginning to like you lads.

1005
01:02:34,116 --> 01:02:36,853
Despite surrendering their head start,
The Authority is still in front.

1006
01:02:36,953 --> 01:02:41,121
It's a new day, but it might be
the same old outcome in today's race.

1007
01:02:45,127 --> 01:02:46,629
Michael, he's back!

1008
01:02:46,729 --> 01:02:48,631
Inferno was waiting
for the Superstars to pass,

1009
01:02:48,731 --> 01:02:50,233
cutting them off from any retreat.

1010
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:53,202
<i>This is Inferno's mountain!</i>

1011
01:02:53,302 --> 01:02:57,840
<i>I will cast you off
like all the other fools before you.</i>

1012
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:01,077
<i>Inferno's chilling warning
resonates like a thunder strike</i>

1013
01:03:01,177 --> 01:03:04,546
<i>to the Superstars invading
his home ground.</i>

1014
01:03:07,149 --> 01:03:09,185
Oh, once again, the Celtic Cruiser

1015
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:12,255
is the first to fall to the demon
and the Mystery Machine is next.

1016
01:03:13,255 --> 01:03:16,423
- He's behind us!
- Use your doohickey, Fred!

1017
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:23,397
Team Taker smashed into the wall!

1018
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:27,403
Our parachute's gone!

1019
01:03:27,503 --> 01:03:30,406
It wouldn't be a good idea to go up
Deadman's Curve without it.

1020
01:03:30,506 --> 01:03:33,409
<i>The Demon Rig is carving up
this race like a Thanksgiving turkey.</i>

1021
01:03:33,509 --> 01:03:35,745
<i>The Pamplona mashed like a potato.</i>

1022
01:03:35,845 --> 01:03:39,013
<i>The Moscow Express,
ladled with pain gravy.</i>

1023
01:03:40,449 --> 01:03:41,617
Slow down.

1024
01:03:41,717 --> 01:03:43,586
Do you understand what a race is?

1025
01:03:43,686 --> 01:03:45,588
Perfectly. Rusev.

1026
01:03:45,688 --> 01:03:47,623
<i>Take the demon vehicle now!</i>

1027
01:03:47,723 --> 01:03:49,425
Hmm.

1028
01:03:49,525 --> 01:03:51,694
Where are you going?

1029
01:03:51,794 --> 01:03:54,329
Wait a minute, what's Rusev up to?

1030
01:03:55,197 --> 01:03:58,534
No way! He's attacking
the Demon Rig with his bare hands?

1031
01:03:58,634 --> 01:04:00,803
- Traitor!
- No.

1032
01:04:00,903 --> 01:04:04,740
I am loyal. To Mother Russia. Ha!

1033
01:04:06,542 --> 01:04:09,645
And now, Lana is leaving the Too Awesome?

1034
01:04:09,745 --> 01:04:11,580
<i>What is Team Russia up to?</i>

1035
01:04:15,251 --> 01:04:18,587
I claim demon car for glory of Russia.

1036
01:04:22,925 --> 01:04:25,294
<i>What an agonizing backfire.</i>

1037
01:04:27,196 --> 01:04:29,465
Ha, that was awesome!

1038
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,339
The money-maker's at risk!

1039
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:38,474
Repeat, the money-maker's at risk!

1040
01:04:38,574 --> 01:04:39,940
Get in, you big baby!

1041
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:50,786
I can deal with the Russians,
but I've had enough of that creep.

1042
01:04:50,886 --> 01:04:52,655
Finally, something we agree on.

1043
01:04:52,755 --> 01:04:54,290
How about we forget the race and...

1044
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:56,092
Squash us a demon!

1045
01:04:56,192 --> 01:04:58,961
Text the others.
Maybe they'd like to join the fun.

1046
01:05:02,298 --> 01:05:04,433
- Ooh!
- The Miz.

1047
01:05:06,435 --> 01:05:08,202
<i>Ole!</i>

1048
01:05:10,606 --> 01:05:11,941
<i>Da!</i>

1049
01:05:12,741 --> 01:05:15,877
Jinkies! They're all going after the demon.

1050
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:22,518
<i>As the race climbs toward the peak,
our Superstars are uniting against Inferno.</i>

1051
01:05:26,155 --> 01:05:27,855
This is my house!

1052
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:34,161
- Mess with the bull...
- And you get the horns!

1053
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:51,547
<i>I've never seen anything like it, folks!</i>

1054
01:05:51,647 --> 01:05:53,716
<i>It's like tag-teaming on wheels.</i>

1055
01:05:53,816 --> 01:05:56,552
<i>It's a numbers game.
It's adding up against Inferno,</i>

1056
01:05:56,652 --> 01:05:59,553
<i>and Inferno is feeling
that frustration right now.</i>

1057
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:05,194
<i>El Torito out of nowhere!
El Torito out of nowhere!</i>

1058
01:06:05,794 --> 01:06:10,433
Somebody get a towel because El Torito
just turned this race into a slobberknocker,

1059
01:06:10,533 --> 01:06:12,399
Lucha Libre style.

1060
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:17,337
<i>Ole!</i>

1061
01:06:19,508 --> 01:06:21,775
Time to cut down that sneaky snake.

1062
01:06:23,012 --> 01:06:25,414
- Ooh!
- The Celtic sword, boys.

1063
01:06:25,514 --> 01:06:26,949
Grab the wheel!

1064
01:06:34,957 --> 01:06:38,260
Amazing! Sheamus just
severed the scorpion tail!

1065
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:39,929
<i>Truly a Celtic warrior!</i>

1066
01:06:40,029 --> 01:06:42,098
Victory!

1067
01:06:42,198 --> 01:06:43,599
<i>What a counter!</i>

1068
01:06:43,699 --> 01:06:45,901
<i>The strength of Inferno
is too much for Sheamus</i>

1069
01:06:46,001 --> 01:06:50,139
<i>and the demon just slithered his way
out of the reach of our Superstars.</i>

1070
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:51,540
But he's not done yet.

1071
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,874
Once again, he's focused
on the lead position.

1072
01:06:57,313 --> 01:06:59,014
- Roadblock!
- Roadblock!

1073
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:04,453
<i>For the first time in this race,
Team Taker is really building momentum,</i>

1074
01:07:04,553 --> 01:07:08,591
<i>no doubt fueled by the Undertaker's
drive to take down Inferno.</i>

1075
01:07:10,092 --> 01:07:11,660
Aren't we close enough?

1076
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,595
Let's find out.

1077
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:18,632
It's working!

1078
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:34,116
Time for a new plan.

1079
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:36,619
Is it, like, go somewhere and hide?

1080
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:38,487
Uh, that could work!

1081
01:07:38,587 --> 01:07:42,491
As my official teammates,
it's time for you two to get up here

1082
01:07:42,591 --> 01:07:46,428
and drive this course like
you've never driven before.

1083
01:07:46,528 --> 01:07:48,495
Good. Because we haven't!

1084
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:54,103
Undertaker just left the Mystery Machine.

1085
01:07:54,203 --> 01:07:57,004
Oh, boy, Inferno's in trouble now.

1086
01:08:01,810 --> 01:08:03,345
Inferno,

1087
01:08:03,445 --> 01:08:06,849
your day of reckoning is upon you

1088
01:08:06,949 --> 01:08:11,520
and the Undertaker will have
no mercy on your soul.

1089
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:14,557
I'll show you, fool.

1090
01:08:14,657 --> 01:08:18,694
<i>The Undertaker squaring off
with the demon of Marauder's Mountain.</i>

1091
01:08:20,629 --> 01:08:22,731
This is getting good.

1092
01:08:26,235 --> 01:08:28,871
<i>The Phenom attacks first,
the demon counters,</i>

1093
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:31,140
<i>Taker reverses, and as they lock up,</i>

1094
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:34,710
<i>it's clear that these two supernatural
forces are evenly matched.</i>

1095
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:37,845
<i>We're in for a wild ride, folks.</i>

1096
01:08:46,088 --> 01:08:48,390
Stay on Inferno, I've got another plan.

1097
01:08:48,490 --> 01:08:50,492
Like, how many plans are there?

1098
01:08:50,592 --> 01:08:53,395
Just get us to Deadman's Curve.
It's our only chance.

1099
01:08:53,495 --> 01:08:55,564
That sounds like a horrible plan!

1100
01:08:55,664 --> 01:08:57,066
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

1101
01:08:57,166 --> 01:08:59,768
Shaggy, Scooby, you can do this, remember?

1102
01:08:59,868 --> 01:09:02,538
You ate dozens of these
Deadman's Curve pretzels.

1103
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:04,707
They're an exact copy of the route.

1104
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:07,676
She's right. Like, we know every turn.

1105
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:10,577
- We do?
- Like the back of our bellies.

1106
01:09:16,518 --> 01:09:18,587
Scooby-Doo, we can do this!

1107
01:09:18,687 --> 01:09:22,056
Oh, yeah. Right, right, left, left.

1108
01:09:27,029 --> 01:09:30,699
<i>The heavens above tremble
as these two Goliaths battle it out.</i>

1109
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:33,469
<i>With neither one showing
any sign of backing down</i>

1110
01:09:33,569 --> 01:09:36,105
<i>as they approach
the pinnacle of this race,</i>

1111
01:09:36,205 --> 01:09:38,607
<i>Deadman's Curve.</i>

1112
01:09:38,707 --> 01:09:39,942
Here we go, Michael.

1113
01:09:40,042 --> 01:09:43,410
The company car takes the leap first
followed closely by the Demon Rig.

1114
01:09:47,716 --> 01:09:48,882
Hold on, everybody.

1115
01:09:51,587 --> 01:09:53,620
Whoo! Parachutes have popped.

1116
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:00,296
- No!
- No!

1117
01:10:00,396 --> 01:10:01,797
Are you sure about this?

1118
01:10:01,897 --> 01:10:03,732
Trust me. Don't stop!

1119
01:10:15,344 --> 01:10:19,415
Incredible! The Mystery Machine
has tethered itself to the Demon Rig.

1120
01:10:19,515 --> 01:10:21,583
This is some plan, Fred.

1121
01:10:21,683 --> 01:10:22,816
Cool, huh?

1122
01:10:27,908 --> 01:10:30,426
Your end is near, demon.

1123
01:10:30,526 --> 01:10:32,325
Prepare to be punished.

1124
01:10:33,862 --> 01:10:34,863
Woo-hoo!

1125
01:10:34,963 --> 01:10:36,932
This race is in the bag.

1126
01:10:37,032 --> 01:10:40,467
The combined weight of two vehicles
is causing the Demon Rig to fall faster.

1127
01:10:40,936 --> 01:10:41,738
What?

1128
01:10:41,838 --> 01:10:44,606
And the Company Car falls to second place.

1129
01:10:44,706 --> 01:10:47,309
<i>And despite this
death-defying parachute plunge,</i>

1130
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:50,310
<i>Inferno and Undertaker
continue their epic match.</i>

1131
01:10:51,947 --> 01:10:54,149
Nowhere to run, demon.

1132
01:10:54,249 --> 01:10:55,348
Nowhere to hide.

1133
01:10:56,151 --> 01:10:58,819
You are mine.

1134
01:11:06,995 --> 01:11:09,362
Inferno just jumped to the Mystery
Machine to escape the Undertaker.

1135
01:11:12,134 --> 01:11:13,333
Go, guys, go!

1136
01:11:16,905 --> 01:11:20,175
You won't escape the
Undertaker that easy, demon.

1137
01:11:20,275 --> 01:11:22,711
<i>As the other Superstars
return to</i> Terra firma,

1138
01:11:22,811 --> 01:11:27,013
<i>we're back to a road race for
the home stretch of the Muscle Moto X.</i>

1139
01:11:27,816 --> 01:11:29,549
You will both pay!

1140
01:11:31,086 --> 01:11:32,719
Ah! Oh! Ow!

1141
01:11:34,423 --> 01:11:38,859
<i>With no competition in sight,
the Mystery Machine finishes first.</i>

1142
01:11:39,695 --> 01:11:41,997
I will not stop!

1143
01:11:42,097 --> 01:11:44,430
But, like, we will.

1144
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:52,539
<i>The demon is down, pummeled by pretzels!</i>

1145
01:11:54,109 --> 01:11:58,580
<i>And the Undertaker takes second
place, piloting the Demon Rig!</i>

1146
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:04,584
Undertaker! Undertaker!

1147
01:12:08,857 --> 01:12:10,292
<i>Brace yourselves, folks.</i>

1148
01:12:10,392 --> 01:12:13,862
<i>The Undertaker's about
to deliver judgment.</i>

1149
01:12:24,111 --> 01:12:25,774
That was the Last Ride.

1150
01:12:25,874 --> 01:12:27,409
It's over.

1151
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:29,244
This is awesome!

1152
01:12:29,344 --> 01:12:31,611
That one was for Dusty.

1153
01:12:35,484 --> 01:12:36,785
It's not over!

1154
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:43,456
And now you will...

1155
01:12:43,926 --> 01:12:44,991
rest...

1156
01:12:45,394 --> 01:12:46,762
in...

1157
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:48,795
peace.

1158
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:56,972
Tombstone Piledriver!

1159
01:12:57,072 --> 01:12:58,640
Now, it's over.

1160
01:12:59,408 --> 01:13:02,144
<i>Vintage Undertaker!</i>

1161
01:13:02,244 --> 01:13:03,310
- Yay!
- Yay!

1162
01:13:05,914 --> 01:13:09,149
What a way to finish the Muscle Moto X!

1163
01:13:23,265 --> 01:13:25,532
Now let's see who this really is.

1164
01:13:30,272 --> 01:13:31,840
Triple H?

1165
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:34,176
We suspected it had to be a Superstar

1166
01:13:34,276 --> 01:13:37,045
when the demon broke out
of The Miz's wrestling hold.

1167
01:13:37,145 --> 01:13:40,981
But Triple H wasn't the mastermind
behind all this, was he, Stephanie?

1168
01:13:43,118 --> 01:13:44,887
Oh, no.

1169
01:13:44,987 --> 01:13:48,557
You know what, Dad? I told you
to fire them, but you never listen.

1170
01:13:48,657 --> 01:13:51,493
This is so heavy.

1171
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:54,530
But we saw them both
in the car during the races.

1172
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:57,533
You thought you did, but you saw this.

1173
01:13:57,633 --> 01:14:00,368
An inflatable airbag dummy.

1174
01:14:03,505 --> 01:14:05,641
- Then who was driving?
- Stephanie was.

1175
01:14:05,741 --> 01:14:08,343
With remote motion-control gear.

1176
01:14:08,443 --> 01:14:11,914
<i>That way, she could drive
while sitting in the passenger seat.</i>

1177
01:14:12,014 --> 01:14:13,849
<i>Meanwhile, Triple H could be Inferno</i>

1178
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:18,554
<i>and use the same motion-control
system to drive the Demon Rig.</i>

1179
01:14:18,654 --> 01:14:21,657
<i>But it wasn't always Stephanie
in the company car.</i>

1180
01:14:21,757 --> 01:14:23,725
<i>At the lake, it was Triple H.</i>

1181
01:14:23,825 --> 01:14:27,696
<i>That way Stephanie could be the demon
in case anyone suspected her husband.</i>

1182
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:29,064
Sorry about this, honey.

1183
01:14:29,164 --> 01:14:31,366
Make it real, Steph.

1184
01:14:40,876 --> 01:14:43,278
What about the night
their oil line got cut?

1185
01:14:43,378 --> 01:14:45,948
Why would they sabotage their own car?

1186
01:14:46,048 --> 01:14:47,916
Triple H wasn't intending to.

1187
01:14:48,016 --> 01:14:50,655
What he was doing was changing the airbags

1188
01:14:50,755 --> 01:14:53,221
<i>from the Triple H dummy
to the Stephanie dummy.</i>

1189
01:14:53,321 --> 01:14:56,858
<i>That's why there was talcum
powder on the ground.</i>

1190
01:14:56,958 --> 01:14:59,261
<i>But Shaggy and Scooby saw him...</i>

1191
01:14:59,361 --> 01:15:01,397
Zoinks!

1192
01:15:01,797 --> 01:15:04,297
<i>...so he cut the oil line
to cover his activities.</i>

1193
01:15:05,467 --> 01:15:10,305
My plan would've worked, too, if it
weren't for you meddling kids and your...

1194
01:15:10,405 --> 01:15:12,706
Your speedster dog!

1195
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:15,477
Don't forget Taker.

1196
01:15:15,577 --> 01:15:17,711
Thank you, Scooby-Doo.

1197
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:23,385
The only mystery left is, where did
you go every time Inferno showed up?

1198
01:15:23,485 --> 01:15:26,488
Well, uh, to tell you the truth,
I was practicing.

1199
01:15:26,588 --> 01:15:30,123
I planned to sing the national anthem
at the closing ceremony tonight.

1200
01:15:31,059 --> 01:15:34,627
But what I want to know is,
why, Stephanie? Why?

1201
01:15:35,163 --> 01:15:36,465
To win.

1202
01:15:36,565 --> 01:15:39,601
And to make Muscle Moto X a huge success.

1203
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:42,838
Dad, I wanted to show you
that I could do it all.

1204
01:15:42,938 --> 01:15:45,140
But I've always known that.

1205
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:48,408
The only reason I didn't want you in the
race is that I didn't want you to get hurt.

1206
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:54,147
Well, I'm afraid this time, you're gonna
have to pay for your mistakes, kiddo.

1207
01:16:05,627 --> 01:16:08,497
This must be kind of tough
on you, Mr. McMahon.

1208
01:16:08,597 --> 01:16:10,932
I'm not worried.
They'll learn their lesson.

1209
01:16:11,032 --> 01:16:13,835
And my lawyers will have this
whole thing sorted out in 24 hours.

1210
01:16:13,935 --> 01:16:15,201
They're that darn good.

1211
01:16:20,609 --> 01:16:24,346
<i># O'er the land of the free</i>

1212
01:16:24,446 --> 01:16:26,214
<i># And the home</i>

1213
01:16:26,314 --> 01:16:29,015
<i># Of the brave #</i>

1214
01:16:36,825 --> 01:16:37,891
Nailed it.

1215
01:16:40,629 --> 01:16:43,365
I heard you got plans for
your winnings, Undertaker.

1216
01:16:43,465 --> 01:16:44,900
Indeed.

1217
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,070
Thanks to my teammates,
Skinny Man and Dead Meat

1218
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:52,874
and their pals, my little creatures
of the night will now experience

1219
01:16:52,974 --> 01:16:56,376
the magical art of puppetry.

1220
01:17:02,851 --> 01:17:05,487
And what are you guys doing
with your share of the winnings?

1221
01:17:05,587 --> 01:17:06,688
Fair's fair.

1222
01:17:06,788 --> 01:17:08,824
It's going to Dusty Rhodes.

1223
01:17:08,924 --> 01:17:10,824
And his American dream.

1224
01:17:16,631 --> 01:17:18,433
Don't know how to thank you boys.

1225
01:17:18,533 --> 01:17:21,436
I've been so down, I couldn't even sleep.

1226
01:17:21,536 --> 01:17:23,438
Just spent the nights a-walking.

1227
01:17:23,538 --> 01:17:26,906
The good news is, it rehabbed
my back and now I feel great.

1228
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:37,219
Rusev and I have gift.

1229
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:39,554
Like, don't you want to crush us?

1230
01:17:39,654 --> 01:17:41,223
In race, yes.

1231
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:44,126
But is important to be good
sport after competition.

1232
01:17:44,226 --> 01:17:46,829
Rusev hug!

1233
01:17:47,229 --> 01:17:49,596
Next year, we add sharks.

1234
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:56,371
Today, the bell tolls to honor
the triumph of Team Taker

1235
01:17:56,471 --> 01:17:59,708
and all the WWE Superstars.

1236
01:17:59,808 --> 01:18:03,243
Victory is ours.

1237
01:18:09,050 --> 01:18:12,120
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

1238
01:18:13,305 --> 01:19:13,799
