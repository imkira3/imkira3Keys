00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:21,472
A week ago, the only thing

3
00:03:21,572 --> 00:03:22,300
I thought was...

4
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,925
Out of the ordinary was
that it was my birthday.

5
00:03:49,134 --> 00:03:52,234
Sorry.

6
00:03:52,234 --> 00:03:54,234
I’m just bored.

7
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,800
Oh.

8
00:04:09,301 --> 00:04:11,400
Unit 5, come in.

9
00:04:12,934 --> 00:04:15,167
Unit 5, come in.

10
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:17,167
Do you read me, unit 5?

11
00:04:18,934 --> 00:04:20,159
Of course, things

12
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:22,259
Didn't really start here.

13
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:31,067
* I’ll have a blue... *

14
00:04:31,067 --> 00:04:33,567
How do I look?

15
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:35,567
The truth?
- I look like...

16
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:37,201
a rock star, don't I?

17
00:04:37,301 --> 00:04:39,663
You look great.
- Hey, what's going on...

18
00:04:39,763 --> 00:04:40,300
with you?

19
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,478
What?
- Why are you acting...

20
00:04:41,578 --> 00:04:41,934
so weird?

21
00:04:42,034 --> 00:04:43,272
What do you mean?
- You got drugs on you?

22
00:04:43,372 --> 00:04:43,934
Smoking cigarettes?

23
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,701
Huh? Oh, just holding them for a friend, huh?

24
00:04:45,801 --> 00:04:46,400
Have a good time.

25
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,533
Ha ha.
- have a good time.

26
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:51,567
Aggie, you okay?

27
00:04:53,234 --> 00:04:56,667
Sexy.

28
00:04:56,667 --> 00:04:58,834
Do you hate me?

29
00:04:58,834 --> 00:05:00,634
As much now as the day I met you.

30
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:02,857
You know,
I might be contagious.

31
00:05:02,957 --> 00:05:04,168
I could be immune.

32
00:05:04,268 --> 00:05:07,333
What about the party?
- Like they're gonna miss me.

33
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:10,368
What about the cake?

34
00:05:10,368 --> 00:05:12,126
I’d like two words...

35
00:05:12,226 --> 00:05:13,168
on my tombstone--...

36
00:05:13,268 --> 00:05:15,368
'What if?'

37
00:05:15,368 --> 00:05:18,600
What if I had said screw the cake?

38
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,134
Single tonight, Walter?

39
00:05:20,234 --> 00:05:22,533
Not actually, no.

40
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:25,101
Oh, hey!
- Oh, come on.

41
00:05:25,101 --> 00:05:26,293
Why don't you wag your tail at me...

42
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:27,134
in the bitches' room?

43
00:05:27,234 --> 00:05:28,700
Sybil.

44
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,077
What if I had been...

45
00:05:30,177 --> 00:05:30,634
a bit more...

46
00:05:30,734 --> 00:05:32,367
Sybil, I wouldn't wag my tail in the bathroom...

47
00:05:32,467 --> 00:05:35,300
with you if you were the last bitch on earth.

48
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,700
...tactful?

49
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,400
Sparrow, I repeat.

50
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,834
We have an unidentified scavenger sighting.

51
00:05:43,934 --> 00:05:45,534
It’s one minute to 5:00, Sybil.

52
00:05:45,634 --> 00:05:48,767
Then we're agreed you're still on duty.

53
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:53,934
Mm-hmm, yeah, sure.

54
00:05:55,067 --> 00:05:57,967
Sounds delicious.
Can I get it to go?

55
00:06:00,268 --> 00:06:02,467
Right.

56
00:06:02,467 --> 00:06:05,634
Okay okay.

57
00:06:15,467 --> 00:06:18,634
Come to papa.

58
00:06:18,634 --> 00:06:20,234
Maybe you'd like to hear a story.

59
00:06:20,334 --> 00:06:22,767
Hmm?

60
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:25,967
Yeah, once upon a time...

61
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:28,101
there was a dog...

62
00:06:28,101 --> 00:06:29,734
who lived a life of terror,

63
00:06:29,834 --> 00:06:32,934
feared no one.

64
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:36,467
But although his teeth were sharp...

65
00:06:36,467 --> 00:06:39,734
and his belly full,

66
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:41,234
his heart was empty.

67
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:44,400
He decided to go on a journey...

68
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,268
to a land far far away,

69
00:06:48,268 --> 00:06:51,800
where he came upon a wooden shack one day...

70
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,301
with a thin old man inside.

71
00:06:55,301 --> 00:06:58,034
And he invited him in.

72
00:06:58,034 --> 00:07:00,234
The dog...

73
00:07:00,234 --> 00:07:03,700
was overjoyed.

74
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,534
And that night...

75
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:08,867
warm smoke billowed from the chimney above,

76
00:07:08,867 --> 00:07:11,067
but, oh...

77
00:07:11,067 --> 00:07:14,067
what an odd-smelling smoke this was.

78
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:17,301
You see,
the land was China.

79
00:07:18,467 --> 00:07:21,301
And in China,

80
00:07:21,301 --> 00:07:24,368
they eat dog.

81
00:07:24,368 --> 00:07:26,467
Whoa! Ooh!

82
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:31,500
Let me see who your irresponsible owner is.

83
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,400
Oh, god!

84
00:07:50,234 --> 00:07:52,234
Damn it!

85
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:57,934
Didn’t like my story,
huh?

86
00:07:57,934 --> 00:08:01,667
That’s all right.
I can take criticism.

87
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,268
Oh, god.

88
00:08:31,368 --> 00:08:33,618
Oh, I don't believe this shit.

89
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:40,901
All right, buddy,
pick a spot.

90
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:48,301
Now where'd you go?

91
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,268
Destiny--...

92
00:09:41,368 --> 00:09:43,400
Maybe that's too big a word for it.

93
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,305
If I’d been nicer to Sybil,
she never would have sent me...

94
00:09:46,405 --> 00:09:47,134
after that dog.

95
00:09:47,234 --> 00:09:49,700
I wouldn't have been late to meet Agatha,

96
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,367
and none of this would have happened.

97
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,234
But I was late.

98
00:09:54,334 --> 00:09:56,467
And that's all it took.

99
00:09:56,467 --> 00:09:58,467
Oh!

100
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,599
Take a look at that.
Try not to throw up.

101
00:10:02,699 --> 00:10:03,433
Oh oh, god!

102
00:10:03,533 --> 00:10:05,567
'Nasty evil dog'--

103
00:10:05,567 --> 00:10:07,934
That's what 'Ned' stands for.

104
00:10:07,934 --> 00:10:09,499
If I ever see him again,
he's gonna be Ned...

105
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:10,101
with two d's--...

106
00:10:10,201 --> 00:10:11,767
'Nasty evil dead dog.'

107
00:10:11,867 --> 00:10:13,715
All right, now take a deep breath.

108
00:10:13,815 --> 00:10:14,268
Dead Ned.

109
00:10:14,368 --> 00:10:16,567
That’s what he's gonna be.
- And remember,

110
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:18,534
it's your birthday, okay?

111
00:10:18,634 --> 00:10:19,811
Yeah, I’ve been thinking about that.

112
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:20,134
Hmm-hmm.

113
00:10:20,234 --> 00:10:22,043
Why is it we go and see your friends...

114
00:10:22,143 --> 00:10:22,867
on my birthday?

115
00:10:22,967 --> 00:10:24,433
Um...

116
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:27,301
Probably because you don't have any.

117
00:10:27,301 --> 00:10:28,901
Oh.

118
00:10:29,001 --> 00:10:31,001
Makes sense.

119
00:10:31,001 --> 00:10:33,734
So I’m older, I’m disfigured,

120
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:35,634
and I’m spending an evening in hell.

121
00:10:35,734 --> 00:10:37,648
No.
- I suppose I’m buying...

122
00:10:37,748 --> 00:10:38,934
that for you too.

123
00:10:39,034 --> 00:10:40,272
Well, actually, I’ve had a good long time...

124
00:10:40,372 --> 00:10:40,934
to flip through it.

125
00:10:41,034 --> 00:10:42,567
Why don't you give it a try?

126
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:45,076
Have some writer fill my head with nonsense?

127
00:10:45,176 --> 00:10:46,467
I’ll wait for the movie.

128
00:10:46,567 --> 00:10:48,067
You don't know what you're missing.

129
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:50,934
Hmm, and yet life goes on.

130
00:10:50,934 --> 00:10:53,134

132
00:10:56,101 --> 00:10:58,101
Hmm.

133

Beware of the dog next door.'

136
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:09,500
Get out of here.
Are you kidding me?

137
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,467
I’m buying this for you, okay?

138
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:13,101
Would you get the cake?
- Yeah.

139
00:11:13,201 --> 00:11:15,228
February 3rd, that makes...

140
00:11:15,328 --> 00:11:15,901
me Aquarius.

141

Experts say friends are vitally important.

142
00:11:19,234 --> 00:11:20,767
Hi.
- Hello.

143
00:11:20,867 --> 00:11:22,268
Hi.
- Hey.

144
00:11:22,368 --> 00:11:25,700
Hello.
- Hey.

145
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,201
I’m sorry we're late.

146
00:11:27,301 --> 00:11:29,367
Nothing a kiss won't cure.
- Oh!

147
00:11:29,467 --> 00:11:31,837
I am living proof of...

148
00:11:31,937 --> 00:11:33,567
the fallacy of astrology.

149
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:36,301
Hi. How’s your arm, birthday boy?

150
00:11:36,301 --> 00:11:37,679
You okay?
- Just waiting for it...

151
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:38,300
to fall off.

152
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,288
Good thing it didn't bite you somewhere else.

153
00:11:40,388 --> 00:11:40,467
Oh.

154
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:42,057
Five seconds. Five seconds.

155
00:11:42,157 --> 00:11:42,667
Fourth word.

156
00:11:42,767 --> 00:11:44,901
Birds, butterflies, birds.
- It flies.

157
00:11:45,001 --> 00:11:46,300
Birds, birds.
- Flies, flies.

158
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,775
'Lord of the flies'!

159
00:11:51,734 --> 00:11:54,334
Okay, you're next.
- Thank you.

160

Now it's time for birthday sex.

166
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,834
I need a lot of birthday sex.

00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,634
You know what?
- What?

168
00:12:32,634 --> 00:12:34,134
Let’s sit out here for a while.

Come on, it'll be romantic.
- Yeah, but it's also cold.

171
00:12:39,433 --> 00:12:41,800
Here, take my coat.

172
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,134
Your jacket, take it.
I’ll call you.

173
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,067
Mom, dad. I thought I heard voices.

174
00:12:53,067 --> 00:12:54,634
Well, you know,

175
00:12:54,734 --> 00:12:56,795
if someone was in bed
asleep the way they were...

176
00:12:56,895 --> 00:12:57,534
supposed to be,

177
00:12:57,634 --> 00:12:59,119
they wouldn't hear any voices.

178
00:12:59,219 --> 00:12:59,834
In bed? Okay.

179
00:12:59,934 --> 00:13:02,967
You’re supposed to be in bed.

180
00:13:02,967 --> 00:13:06,034
Oh, dad. Dad, I, uh,
forgot to give you this.

181
00:13:06,134 --> 00:13:08,234
Here.
- Oh, cool.

182
00:13:08,234 --> 00:13:10,128
Yeah, I wrapped it myself.

183
00:13:10,228 --> 00:13:10,467
Yeah.

184
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:14,101
I accept bribes any time of the day or night.

185
00:13:14,101 --> 00:13:15,867
Back door?

186
00:13:15,967 --> 00:13:17,700
She went down the alley.

187
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,534
Wow, that's cool.

188
00:13:19,634 --> 00:13:23,268
Robin,
she's a nice girl.

189
00:13:23,268 --> 00:13:25,168
Make sure she stays that way.

190
00:13:25,268 --> 00:13:27,567
All right.
Good night, dad.

191
00:13:27,567 --> 00:13:29,934
Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

192
00:13:40,268 --> 00:13:42,893
'Chapter 1: you can...

193
00:13:42,943 --> 00:13:44,600
call me Fingerling.

194
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,767
It’s not my real name.

195
00:13:46,767 --> 00:13:49,500
It came from a book I read as a child,

196
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,201
'Fingerling at the zoo.'

197
00:13:52,201 --> 00:13:54,500
Paper flap long gone,

198
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,001
it had a green hardback cover
and mottled texture.

199
00:13:58,101 --> 00:14:01,600
It was possibly my very first book.

200
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,268
Funny,

201
00:14:03,368 --> 00:14:06,467
I can't recall what it was about.

202
00:14:06,467 --> 00:14:09,001
The only thing I remember is the name--...

203
00:14:09,101 --> 00:14:10,967
Fingerling.

204
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:13,634
I wished it was mine...

205
00:14:13,634 --> 00:14:16,500
And now it is.'

206
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,700
This is your first bite?

207
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,800
First animal one, yes.

208
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,367
My wife, she has these gnawing urges...

209
00:14:35,467 --> 00:14:37,467
in her sleep and...

210
00:14:37,467 --> 00:14:40,234
Tell me about this canine Ned.

211
00:14:40,234 --> 00:14:41,723
What would you do if you came across...

212
00:14:41,823 --> 00:14:42,201
him again?

213
00:14:42,301 --> 00:14:45,634
If I was in my truck,
I’d accelerate...

214
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,667
until I heard a thud.

215
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,867
I’m sorry.
I’m just-- I’m joking.

216
00:14:51,967 --> 00:14:53,867
I just-- this is just silly.

217
00:14:53,967 --> 00:14:55,973
Mr. Sparrow,
animal-control...

218
00:14:56,073 --> 00:14:57,268
regulations state...

219
00:14:57,368 --> 00:14:59,901
that any officer suffering
at the hands of an animal...

220
00:15:00,001 --> 00:15:03,333
must undergo psychological
counseling within seven days...

221
00:15:03,433 --> 00:15:05,333
to evaluate their state of mind.

222
00:15:05,433 --> 00:15:07,500
I gave him my arm on a platter.

223
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,500
Can't blame a creature
of lower intelligence for that.

224
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,686
I made a mistake, okay?
Write that down.

225
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:13,667
I made a mistake.

226
00:15:13,767 --> 00:15:16,600
It's my fault-- like when I told my wife

227
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,367
She could choose the color...

228
00:15:18,467 --> 00:15:20,600
for the living room walls,
you know?

229
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:24,300
Not that women are of
lower intelligence, just...

230
00:15:27,034 --> 00:15:29,167
Have a good day,
Mr. Sparrow.

231
00:15:29,167 --> 00:15:30,333
No, I’m jus--

232
00:15:30,433 --> 00:15:34,033
No, Agatha is the most
intelligent person I know.

233
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,567
What she sees in me,
I’m not sure.

234
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:38,300
Look...

235
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,467
I love my job,
and I’m good at it.

236
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:42,300
Ned got away.

237
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,001
Well, yeah, but...

238
00:15:45,001 --> 00:15:46,590
Don't worry.
Apart from a flawed...

239
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:47,433
sense of humor,

240
00:15:47,533 --> 00:15:49,667
I’m giving you a clean bill of health.

241
00:15:49,767 --> 00:15:51,367
You're not a danger to anyone.

242
00:15:51,467 --> 00:15:55,067
That's why you can go
and have the whole day off.

243
00:15:55,533 --> 00:15:58,334
Really?

244
00:15:58,334 --> 00:16:00,334
I’ll take it.

245
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,934
Mr. Sparrow.
- yeah.

246
00:16:02,034 --> 00:16:04,600
What color did your wife choose for the walls?

247
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,800
Red, blood red.

248
00:16:13,667 --> 00:16:15,692
'Chapter 2:

249
00:16:18,834 --> 00:16:22,067
Imagine me, if you must,

250
00:16:22,067 --> 00:16:24,067
as someone you once knew.

251
00:16:25,867 --> 00:16:29,700
Someone perhaps you liked.

252
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,433
Or better yet,

253
00:16:32,433 --> 00:16:35,734
imagine me as you.

254
00:16:35,734 --> 00:16:38,368
As a kid,
I was top of my class,

255
00:16:38,368 --> 00:16:40,700
not because I liked studying,
but because I realized...

256
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,467
that an education was
my best shot at getting out.

257
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:46,700
See, the stork dropped me
in a small dustbowl of a town.

258
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,700
There wasn't anything wrong with it.

259
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,800
As far as boring towns go,

260
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,034
I’m sure it ranked above average.

261
00:16:54,034 --> 00:16:56,901
I had friends, but...

262
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,767
I always felt alone.

263
00:17:03,334 --> 00:17:05,567
No one ever left,

264
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:07,467
but I wasn't gonna die here.

265
00:17:07,567 --> 00:17:09,201
As much as I loved him,

266
00:17:09,301 --> 00:17:12,500
I didn't want to be anything like my dad.

267
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,433
He seemed so distant and sad.

268
00:17:16,433 --> 00:17:19,134
Numbers were his life.
He was an accountant.

269
00:17:19,234 --> 00:17:21,219
And I guess he had expected me to take over...

270
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,500
the business he had built,

271
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,667
but I had other plans.

272
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:26,600
My mom was tickled pink on my eighth birthday...

273
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,801
when I announced I wanted to be a detective.

274
00:17:29,901 --> 00:17:31,734
Can't say the same for my father.

275
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:34,700
It really put the kibosh on his master plan...

276
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,400
and it fueled his hatred for the widow Dobkins.

277
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,500
She lived next door.

278
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,977
It sounds odd,
but her dog Alfie...

279
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,834
is the reason I became a detective.

280
00:17:43,934 --> 00:17:46,467
The grass is always greener on the other side,

281
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:48,534
at least according to Alfie.

282
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,700
That's why he was always in our yard,

283
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,167
and it was my job to catch him.

284
00:17:55,034 --> 00:17:58,534
But I never crossed the fence
into the widow Dobkins' yard.

285
00:17:58,634 --> 00:18:00,867
That was my father's rule.

286
00:18:00,867 --> 00:18:03,101
On my eighth birthday,

287
00:18:03,101 --> 00:18:05,101
I broke the rule.

288
00:18:10,101 --> 00:18:11,971
Now I must admit that my loneliness

289
00:18:12,071 --> 00:18:12,734
And obsession...

290
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:16,334
with detective stories had fueled fantasies.

291
00:18:16,334 --> 00:18:19,034
So I’m not sure of all the details,

292
00:18:19,034 --> 00:18:21,201
except one.

293
00:18:23,201 --> 00:18:25,226
The widow Dobkins was dead.

294
00:18:32,901 --> 00:18:35,767
It was a whole hour before the doctor arrived,

295
00:18:35,867 --> 00:18:37,567
and in that uncertain hour...

296
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:40,067
my eight-year-old mind raced.

297
00:18:40,067 --> 00:18:41,743
I decided that the widow Dobkins...

298
00:18:41,843 --> 00:18:42,333
was killed...

299
00:18:42,433 --> 00:18:44,901
by a man with a deranged mind,

300
00:18:44,901 --> 00:18:47,834
A mind such as our town had never seen before.

301
00:18:47,934 --> 00:18:50,099
No one would be safe from him, not even...

302
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:51,001
his loved ones.

303
00:18:51,101 --> 00:18:53,234
Especially his loved ones.

304
00:18:53,234 --> 00:18:54,808
Of course, a doctor later concluded that...

305
00:18:54,908 --> 00:18:55,467
it was suicide,

306
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:58,167
But I never believed it.

307
00:18:58,167 --> 00:19:00,110
By then, my mind had been opened...

308
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,767
to a whole new existence.

309
00:19:01,867 --> 00:19:05,101
From this, a detective was born--...

310
00:19:05,101 --> 00:19:07,234
Detective Fingerling.'

311
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:14,167
This has promise too.

312
00:19:15,467 --> 00:19:18,168
Hey, there you are.
What are you doing?

313
00:19:18,268 --> 00:19:20,700
I’ll clean this up later.

314
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,500
Filling your head with nonsense, are you?

315
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,467
Did you read this?
- most of it.

316
00:19:25,467 --> 00:19:28,767
It's very creative.
- this Fingerling guy.

317
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:30,333
Yeah, it's a cool name.

318
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:32,634
Yeah, what did you make of him?

319
00:19:32,734 --> 00:19:34,702
I loved him at the-- well, at the beginning

320
00:19:34,802 --> 00:19:35,034
I did.

321
00:19:35,134 --> 00:19:36,967
What do you mean at the beginning?

322
00:19:37,067 --> 00:19:39,934
Well, he-- how far have you gotten?

323
00:19:39,934 --> 00:19:41,934
Oh, two chapters.
- Oh.

324
00:19:41,934 --> 00:19:43,611
Honey, will you move this ladder for me,

325
00:19:43,711 --> 00:19:44,567
Just right over here?

326
00:19:44,667 --> 00:19:46,726
You know, honey, this Fingerling guy...

327
00:19:46,826 --> 00:19:48,101
reminds me of my life.

328
00:19:48,201 --> 00:19:50,368
It's so weird.

329
00:19:50,368 --> 00:19:53,612
Like, it's like my childhood, my memories,

330
00:19:53,712 --> 00:19:54,268
you know?

331
00:19:54,368 --> 00:19:56,843
Will you hand me that blue paint?

332
00:19:58,067 --> 00:20:00,317
Here.
- Fingerling's nothing...

333
00:20:00,417 --> 00:20:01,034
like you.

334
00:20:01,134 --> 00:20:04,467
Oh, yeah,
look at that?

335
00:20:04,467 --> 00:20:06,791
'Fingerling at the zoo.'
My mother read it to me...

336
00:20:06,891 --> 00:20:07,700
when I was a kid.

337
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,734
I’m sure a lot of people read that as a kid.

338
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:12,134
Did you?
- No.

339
00:20:12,134 --> 00:20:13,460
Ha-aa!
- But you know what?

340
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,834
Every time I read a book,

341
00:20:14,934 --> 00:20:17,481
it's like, the author stole a part of me that

342
00:20:17,581 --> 00:20:18,801
I thought only I knew.

343
00:20:18,901 --> 00:20:20,835
Someday I’m gonna write a book and I’ll do it...

344
00:20:20,935 --> 00:20:21,634
to somebody else.

345
00:20:21,734 --> 00:20:24,400
I don't know, hon.
It's-- it's just really...

346
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,967
kind of strange.
- You know what?

347
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:28,909
There's a lot of neighborhoods with...

348
00:20:29,009 --> 00:20:30,268
houses just like yours,

349
00:20:30,368 --> 00:20:32,234
with streets just like yours.

350
00:20:32,334 --> 00:20:34,101
Yeah?
With dogs next door?

351
00:20:34,201 --> 00:20:36,667
Oh, your neighbor had a dog.
Well, that's shocking.

352
00:20:36,767 --> 00:20:38,564
It wasn't called Alfie.

353
00:20:38,664 --> 00:20:39,700
It was called Chief.

354
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,700
'Mis-chief' my father called it.

355
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,234
He used to escape all the time.
That's why I became an a.c.o.

356
00:20:45,334 --> 00:20:46,734
Fingerling's a detective.

357
00:20:46,834 --> 00:20:49,734
I used to collect detective magazines.

358
00:20:49,734 --> 00:20:52,667
And the widow next door,
Mrs. Dobkins,

359
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:54,967
Well, that's like my mom.

360
00:20:56,533 --> 00:20:59,268
She died on my eighth birthday.

361
00:20:59,268 --> 00:21:01,934
Look, I got freakin' goose bumps.

362
00:21:01,934 --> 00:21:04,700
Honey, keep reading, okay?

363
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,913
Soon you will discover that Fingerling is...

364
00:21:07,013 --> 00:21:07,901
nothing like you.

365
00:21:08,001 --> 00:21:09,534
Somebody wrote a book about dad?

366
00:21:09,634 --> 00:21:12,500
No.
- Yes. Yes.

367
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,634
How's school?
- Horrible.

368
00:21:15,634 --> 00:21:18,134
Am I in it?

369
00:21:18,134 --> 00:21:20,034
I mean, if the book's about dad,

370
00:21:20,134 --> 00:21:21,901
Then I should have, like,
a starring role or something.

371
00:21:22,001 --> 00:21:23,901
Yes, you should,
and yet you don't.

372
00:21:24,001 --> 00:21:26,667
Now what do you think that means?

373
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:29,268
Hmm, jeez.
- Who's that?

374
00:21:29,268 --> 00:21:31,901
Fabrizia.
- Fabrizia?

375
00:21:31,901 --> 00:21:33,700
Uh-huh.

376
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,400
* Got a big plan,
this mindset *...

377
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,591
* maybe it's right at the right place...

378
00:21:45,691 --> 00:21:46,567
and right time *...

379
00:21:46,667 --> 00:21:48,500
* maybe tonight and the whisper *...

380
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,801
* or handshake sending a sign *...

381
00:21:50,901 --> 00:21:52,767
* Wanna make out and kiss hard? *...

382
00:21:52,867 --> 00:21:53,967
* Wait, never mind *...

383
00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:56,134
* Late night and passing *...

384
00:21:56,234 --> 00:21:58,168
* mention it flipped her best friend *...

385
00:21:58,268 --> 00:22:00,001
* Who knows saying maybe it slipped *...

386
00:22:00,101 --> 00:22:02,500
* but the slip turns to terror
and a crush to light *...

387
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,067
* Then she walked in,
he throws up *...

388
00:22:05,167 --> 00:22:07,207
* Believe it's the fright,
it's cute in a way... *...

389
00:22:08,167 --> 00:22:10,573
* till you cannot speak and you leave to have...

390
00:22:10,673 --> 00:22:11,333
a cigarette *...

391
00:22:11,433 --> 00:22:14,333
* Your knees get weak,
escape was just a nod *...

392
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:17,300
* and a casual wave,
obsessed about it *...

393
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,234
* Heavy for the next two days *...

394
00:22:19,334 --> 00:22:22,634
* it's only just a crush it'll go away *...

395
00:22:22,634 --> 00:22:25,433
* it's just like all
the others, it'll go away *...

396
00:22:25,533 --> 00:22:28,600
* Or maybe this is danger
and you just don't know *...

397
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:32,134
* You pray it all away
but it continues to grow *...

398
00:22:32,234 --> 00:22:36,268
* I want to hold you close *...

399
00:22:36,268 --> 00:22:38,500
* Skin pressed against me tight *...

400
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,901
* Lie still,
close your eyes, girl *...

401
00:22:41,001 --> 00:22:43,626
* So lovely it feels so right. *...

402
00:23:54,101 --> 00:23:56,467
'Chapter 5:

403
00:23:56,467 --> 00:23:58,700
I meet the suicide blonde.'

404
00:24:32,834 --> 00:24:34,967
I got a tip from your neighborhood watch.

405
00:24:35,067 --> 00:24:37,268
I know what you're up to.

406
00:24:37,268 --> 00:24:40,467
This befriend-me crap,
it won't work.

407
00:24:40,467 --> 00:24:42,792
Come any closer and I’ll do it.

408
00:24:45,334 --> 00:24:47,168
Well, I hope you don't.

409
00:24:47,268 --> 00:24:49,301
It's my birthday today.

410
00:24:49,301 --> 00:24:50,814
You end up hanging yourself, it'll be...

411
00:24:50,914 --> 00:24:51,667
the worst one ever.

412
00:24:51,767 --> 00:24:54,533
You're pathetic.

413
00:24:56,301 --> 00:24:58,742
I’m serious.
I’ll do it.

414
00:24:58,842 --> 00:24:59,667
Hanging--

415
00:24:59,767 --> 00:25:01,834
It's a painful thing.

416
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,901
Most people get the noose wrong,

417
00:25:04,001 --> 00:25:07,676
end up walking around
with a permanent necklace...

418
00:25:09,034 --> 00:25:12,059
Agonizing reminder of how fucking pitiful...

419
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,034
they are.

420
00:25:14,134 --> 00:25:16,134
Come on, let's talk.

421
00:25:17,667 --> 00:25:20,692
If you're still bummed,
I’ll put one right...

422
00:25:20,792 --> 00:25:22,792
between your eyes.

423
00:25:23,934 --> 00:25:25,934
I’m a good shot.

424
00:25:30,533 --> 00:25:32,558
Is it really your birthday?

425
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,302
'The suicide blonde tells...

426
00:25:45,402 --> 00:25:46,634
me she was a good person once,

427
00:25:46,734 --> 00:25:48,134
but now...'

428
00:25:48,234 --> 00:25:50,600
I’m a bad person.

429
00:25:51,934 --> 00:25:54,600
I don't wanna make you bad.

430
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,001
You don't have that power.

431
00:25:58,533 --> 00:26:01,168
Go see my ex-boyfriend.
he'll show you.

432
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,728
'I should have gotten...

433
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:03,268
out of there...

434
00:26:03,368 --> 00:26:07,334
right at that moment,
but then she said...'

435
00:26:07,334 --> 00:26:09,067
It's this number!

436
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:12,467
This fucking number-- 23.

437
00:26:12,467 --> 00:26:14,101
It rules my world.

438
00:26:14,201 --> 00:26:16,201
It's my father's fault.

439
00:26:16,201 --> 00:26:18,634
He said he'd found a way to beat the number,

440
00:26:18,734 --> 00:26:21,467
that he'd beat it,
that I was safe.

441
00:26:23,067 --> 00:26:26,101
He said, 'daddy loves you.
And he's gonna do something...

442
00:26:26,201 --> 00:26:28,326
both:...to guarantee that you...

443
00:26:28,426 --> 00:26:30,426
won't inherit the curse.'

444
00:26:34,533 --> 00:26:37,134
He was wrong.

445
00:26:37,134 --> 00:26:40,009
His guarantee wasn't worth the blood it...

446
00:26:40,109 --> 00:26:42,109
was written in.

447
00:26:45,201 --> 00:26:48,001
I guess daddy didn't love me enough.

448
00:26:50,967 --> 00:26:53,667
It's everywhere-- dates, times,

449
00:26:53,667 --> 00:26:56,400
license plate numbers, pages of books,

450
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,067
even elevator floor lights.

451
00:26:58,167 --> 00:27:00,457
Soon I found it was in my name. It was in...

452
00:27:00,557 --> 00:27:01,534
the words I spoke.

453
00:27:01,634 --> 00:27:04,867
Nothing, nothing is safe.

454
00:27:04,867 --> 00:27:08,692
Pink is my favorite color.
Do you know what pink is?

455
00:27:11,667 --> 00:27:13,700
Red 27, white 65.

456
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,201
65 plus 27-- 92.
Pink has four letters.

457
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,867
92 divided by four.

458
00:27:18,867 --> 00:27:20,867
Twenty-fucking-three!

459
00:27:22,301 --> 00:27:24,034
'I’ll be honest--...

460
00:27:24,134 --> 00:27:26,167
I didn't get it.

461
00:27:26,167 --> 00:27:27,707
I asked her the only question

462
00:27:27,807 --> 00:27:28,634
I could muster.'

463
00:27:28,734 --> 00:27:30,834
Any more coffee?

464
00:27:30,834 --> 00:27:33,027
'It was important to keep...

465
00:27:33,127 --> 00:27:33,734
her talking,

466
00:27:33,834 --> 00:27:36,901
so I tell her a story.'

467
00:27:36,901 --> 00:27:39,673
I had this uncle,

468
00:27:39,773 --> 00:27:41,667
his name was Charlie.

469
00:27:41,767 --> 00:27:44,168
And, uh, one day,
he read in his stars...

470
00:27:44,268 --> 00:27:46,168
that he was gonna fall in love...

471
00:27:46,268 --> 00:27:48,433
with a woman in red.

472
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:51,301
So he went out looking all day long...

473
00:27:51,301 --> 00:27:53,368
and he found one.

474
00:27:53,368 --> 00:27:55,268
Six months later, they were married.

475
00:27:55,368 --> 00:27:57,368
You're lying.

476
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,289
Two years later, the woman in red...

477
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,667
divorces my uncle,

478
00:28:03,767 --> 00:28:06,317
takes him for everything he's got.

479
00:28:07,734 --> 00:28:10,567
He's out there right now...

480
00:28:10,567 --> 00:28:12,667
at this very moment...

481
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,025
still looking for the woman in red.

482
00:28:19,433 --> 00:28:21,983
Figures he just got the wrong one.

483
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:25,333
And this is supposed to make
me feel better how?

484
00:28:25,433 --> 00:28:28,358
You look smarter than my uncle Charlie.

485
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:33,644
'She has a face meant...

486
00:28:33,744 --> 00:28:34,268
to smile.

487
00:28:34,368 --> 00:28:36,134
And as I exit the building,

488
00:28:36,234 --> 00:28:38,934
I figure it's another job well done.

489
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:07,500
The next day I traced the ex-boyfriend...

490
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,234
suicide blonde mentioned.

491
00:29:10,234 --> 00:29:12,134
Burning coffee grounds is an old trick...

492
00:29:12,234 --> 00:29:14,757
cops use to take away the smell of death...

493
00:29:14,857 --> 00:29:15,901
at a crime scene.

494
00:29:16,001 --> 00:29:19,001
But somebody had used all the coffee.

495
00:29:33,167 --> 00:29:36,367
When I tell Fabrizia about the suicide blonde,

496
00:29:36,467 --> 00:29:39,734
she begs me to take her to the apartment.

497
00:29:39,734 --> 00:29:42,433
Her reaction is pure Fabrizia.

498
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,400
Death and sex--...

499
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,400
what a turn-on.

500
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,567
As the pages fell from the walls,

501
00:29:50,667 --> 00:29:53,092
the scope of the suicide blonde's...

502
00:29:53,192 --> 00:29:54,767
obsession became clear.

503
00:29:54,867 --> 00:29:58,301
She had reduced everything to 23.'

504
00:29:58,301 --> 00:30:00,528
Suicide blonde's voice: it's everywhere--

505
00:30:00,628 --> 00:30:01,300
Dates, times,

506
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,201
license plate numbers,
pages of books,

507
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,537
even elevator floor lights.
Soon I found it was...

508
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:06,134
in my name.

509
00:30:06,234 --> 00:30:08,001
It was in the words I spoke.

510
00:30:08,101 --> 00:30:10,600
It was in my name.
It was in my name.

511
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,800
It was in the words I spoke.

512
00:30:14,667 --> 00:30:16,306
'When I found out what...

513
00:30:16,406 --> 00:30:16,934
her name was,

514
00:30:17,034 --> 00:30:19,500
that added up too.

515
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,700
Maybe it was just a coincidence.

516
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,467
I mean, a name is just a name.

517
00:30:25,467 --> 00:30:28,400
And a number is just a number.

518
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,400
Isn't it?'

519
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,400
It's self-printed,

520
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,667
self-published,

521
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:56,001
and it's by an author I never heard of.

522
00:31:02,433 --> 00:31:04,734
Looks like old Topsy here
hasn't written anything...

523
00:31:04,834 --> 00:31:06,901
before or after since.

524
00:31:14,067 --> 00:31:15,476
Walter, what are...

525
00:31:15,576 --> 00:31:16,134
you doing?

526
00:31:16,234 --> 00:31:19,001
Check this out.

527
00:31:19,001 --> 00:31:20,901
Walter Sparrow doesn't work.

528
00:31:21,001 --> 00:31:23,934
But if I use my middle name...

529
00:31:23,934 --> 00:31:26,533
Walter.
- 5-1-1-9-7.

530
00:31:26,533 --> 00:31:28,533
Isn't that amazing?
- What?

531
00:31:29,767 --> 00:31:32,433
It's all 23.
My birthday-- 2/3,

532
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:34,276
Driver's license,
social security number--...

533
00:31:34,376 --> 00:31:34,834
everything.

534
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:38,901
I was born at 11:12 p.m.
11 plus 12.

535
00:31:38,901 --> 00:31:41,550
It's like it's imitating...

536
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:42,400
my life.

537
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,067
You can't be serious.

538
00:31:44,167 --> 00:31:45,734
The author knows so much about me.

539
00:31:45,834 --> 00:31:47,400
It's as if he chose me.

540
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,234
Is this what you've been doing all day?

541
00:31:49,334 --> 00:31:50,955
Have you finished the book?

542
00:31:51,055 --> 00:31:51,500
Not yet.

543
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,600
You've concerned yourself with minutia...

544
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,934
and you've drawn wild conclusions from them.

545
00:31:56,034 --> 00:31:57,420
What about the fact that Fingerling...

546
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,168
becomes a killer?

547
00:31:58,268 --> 00:31:59,545
A killer?
- And just how many people...

548
00:31:59,645 --> 00:32:00,201
have you killed?

549
00:32:00,301 --> 00:32:02,634
Wait, who gets killed?

550
00:32:02,634 --> 00:32:04,201
Ask Mr. Fingerling.

551
00:32:04,301 --> 00:32:06,301
I’m sorry, honey.

552
00:32:09,734 --> 00:32:11,300
Why this color?

553
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,067
Why did you choose this color?

554
00:32:14,067 --> 00:32:15,934
I don't know, you tell me.

555
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:19,067
Red number five-- r-e-d is 27,

556
00:32:19,067 --> 00:32:20,600
Plus five is 32 which is--

557
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,001
You're reaching now.

558
00:32:23,001 --> 00:32:24,901
Sure, there are differences.

559
00:32:25,001 --> 00:32:27,134
Fingerling's a detective,
I’m a dog catcher;

560
00:32:27,234 --> 00:32:29,567
He met Fabrizia when he was 32,

561
00:32:29,567 --> 00:32:30,934
whereas I met you when I was--...

562
00:32:31,034 --> 00:32:32,762
23.
- and the day...

563
00:32:32,862 --> 00:32:33,934
we met was?

564
00:32:34,034 --> 00:32:36,700
September 14th.
- 9/14.

565
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,167
14 plus 9 is?
- 23!

566
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:42,167
We married

567
00:32:42,236 --> 00:32:43,500
October 13th--...

568
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,567
10/13, 23.

569
00:32:46,567 --> 00:32:48,234
Suicide blonde said it ruled her world.

570
00:32:48,334 --> 00:32:50,228
She killed because of it.
Then she handed it...

571
00:32:50,328 --> 00:32:51,001
on to Fingerling...

572
00:32:51,101 --> 00:32:53,400
on his 32nd birthday-- 23 reversed.

573
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,034
Fingerling called it fate.
Do you know what fate is?

574
00:32:56,134 --> 00:32:58,533
32.

575
00:32:58,533 --> 00:33:00,558
I rest my case, your honor.

576
00:33:02,567 --> 00:33:04,110
Honey, I think you're
taking this too seriously.

577
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:04,634
Wait wait wait...

578
00:33:04,734 --> 00:33:06,734
wait wait wait.
We live at 1814.

579
00:33:06,834 --> 00:33:08,245
I mean, 18 is one plus eight...

580
00:33:08,345 --> 00:33:09,234
which equals nine.

581
00:33:09,334 --> 00:33:11,901
And nine plus 14 is also 23.

582
00:33:11,901 --> 00:33:14,467
14 is one plus four which equals five.

583
00:33:14,567 --> 00:33:16,634
And five plus 18 is 23 too.

584
00:33:16,634 --> 00:33:18,867
Oh my god.
- All right, Robin,

585
00:33:18,867 --> 00:33:20,333
Please don't you start this nonsense.

586
00:33:20,433 --> 00:33:23,976
This is not nonsense!
I-i mean, five plus...

587
00:33:24,076 --> 00:33:24,734
18 is 23.

588
00:33:24,834 --> 00:33:27,533
Well, if the book were 27 or 150,

589
00:33:27,533 --> 00:33:29,700
you could do the same thing.

590
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:33,001
18 plus 14 is 32.

591
00:33:33,001 --> 00:33:35,201
23 reversed.

592
00:33:35,201 --> 00:33:37,201
Spooky, huh?

593
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,767
'Chapter 7:

594
00:33:41,767 --> 00:33:44,767
The suicide blonde had given Fabrizia a taste...

595
00:33:44,867 --> 00:33:45,901
for new thrills.

596
00:33:46,001 --> 00:33:47,867
I played along,

597
00:33:47,967 --> 00:33:50,867
but all I could think about was the number.'

598
00:33:50,967 --> 00:33:53,134
Thanks.

599
00:33:53,134 --> 00:33:55,134
'I didn't tell her...

600
00:33:55,134 --> 00:33:58,209
that the clock behind the desk read 9:14.

601
00:34:02,834 --> 00:34:05,309
Just rip it open.
Just rip it off.

602
00:34:14,101 --> 00:34:16,934
Pretend you have a knife.
Pretend you have a knife.

603
00:34:17,034 --> 00:34:18,567
Come on.

604
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:30,234
I know you're gonna hurt me.

605
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,767
You shut up, bitch,

606
00:34:32,767 --> 00:34:35,101
or you die.

607
00:34:35,101 --> 00:34:36,646
'Of course I would never...

608
00:34:36,746 --> 00:34:37,534
really harm Fabrizia.

609
00:34:37,634 --> 00:34:41,201
I loved her.
And I thought she loved me.'

610
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,375
'But I started having...

611
00:35:22,425 --> 00:35:24,425
terrible nightmares.'

612
00:36:15,101 --> 00:36:18,304
Eight, nine, 10,

613
00:36:18,404 --> 00:36:19,600
11, 12, 13--

614
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,700
What are you doing?

615
00:36:22,834 --> 00:36:25,134
Reading.

616
00:36:25,134 --> 00:36:28,301
You're insane.

617
00:37:22,667 --> 00:37:25,334
Isaac?
- Simply put,

618
00:37:25,334 --> 00:37:26,967
It's a box that collects...

619
00:37:27,067 --> 00:37:30,167
Orgone energy.

620
00:37:30,167 --> 00:37:32,872
We'll talk about Wilhelm Reich next week.

621
00:37:32,972 --> 00:37:34,333
Thank you for coming.

622
00:37:34,433 --> 00:37:37,433
Well, it sounds like a fascinating read.

623
00:37:37,433 --> 00:37:39,300
Of course there exist far too few books...

624
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,214
where the main character plays...

625
00:37:41,314 --> 00:37:42,134
the saxophone.

626
00:37:42,234 --> 00:37:44,101
I wasn't aware you also played.

627
00:37:44,201 --> 00:37:45,300
I don't.
That's just it,

628
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,400
it doesn't all match.

629
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,834
It's the number.
I’m seeing it everywhere.

630
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:52,234
Well, conspiracy buffs would say, 'of course.

631
00:37:52,334 --> 00:37:55,333
After all, the world spins in an axis of 23°.'

632
00:37:55,433 --> 00:37:57,801
When you tell them it's
actually 23.5, they say...

633
00:37:57,901 --> 00:38:00,967
five is simply two plus three.

634
00:38:03,201 --> 00:38:04,856
23 is very good...

635
00:38:04,956 --> 00:38:06,367
at this particular game.

636
00:38:06,467 --> 00:38:09,433
Game?
- Yeah, paranoia.

637
00:38:11,301 --> 00:38:13,758
There's a fair bit of
literature on the 23 enigma.

638
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:14,268
There is?

639
00:38:14,368 --> 00:38:17,533
There are 23 axioms to Euclid's geometry.

640
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,101
The human body consists of 46 chromosomes--...

641
00:38:22,201 --> 00:38:24,500
23 from each parent.

642
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:28,201
Blood takes 23 seconds to circulate.

643
00:38:28,201 --> 00:38:30,201
The Mayans believed the end of the world...

644
00:38:30,301 --> 00:38:33,767
would occur December 12th, 2012.

645
00:38:33,767 --> 00:38:35,867
20 plus 12 is?

646
00:38:35,867 --> 00:38:38,101
23 reversed.

647
00:38:38,101 --> 00:38:40,634
Or 20 plus one plus two.

648
00:38:40,634 --> 00:38:42,268
So what is this?

649
00:38:42,368 --> 00:38:44,967
What is 23?

650
00:38:44,967 --> 00:38:47,834
Is it...

651
00:38:47,834 --> 00:38:49,901
God?

652
00:38:49,901 --> 00:38:51,567
Two divided by three--...

653
00:38:51,667 --> 00:38:54,034
.666.

654
00:38:54,034 --> 00:38:57,567
666, the number of the devil.

655
00:38:57,567 --> 00:39:00,567
There are only 22 chapters
In the book of revelations.

656
00:39:00,667 --> 00:39:04,201
We all know how that ends.

657
00:39:04,201 --> 00:39:06,400
So is 23 a blessing or a curse?

658
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,152
What's true is that there's a select group...

659
00:39:08,252 --> 00:39:08,567
of people...

660
00:39:08,667 --> 00:39:10,879
that take delight in perpetuating...

661
00:39:10,979 --> 00:39:12,300
the number's infamy.

662
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,234
Lucky seven,
unlucky 13,

663
00:39:15,234 --> 00:39:17,567
ballplayers,
lucky shoes.

664
00:39:17,567 --> 00:39:19,818
People only pray because
they believe that god...

665
00:39:19,918 --> 00:39:21,168
will help them if they do.

666
00:39:21,268 --> 00:39:24,067
This is magical thinking,

667
00:39:24,067 --> 00:39:25,690
non-scientific causal reasoning.

668
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:26,367
Now you're--...

669
00:39:26,467 --> 00:39:29,300
you're looking for 23 so you're finding it.

670
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,346
Agatha thinks

671
00:39:32,446 --> 00:39:33,333
I’m nuts.

672
00:39:33,433 --> 00:39:36,201
Finish the book.

673
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,801
And if after reading it in its entirety,

674
00:39:39,901 --> 00:39:41,400
you still believe the subject to be you,

675
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,067
then whoever wrote it knows you very well.

676
00:39:43,167 --> 00:39:45,734
And only they can give you your answer.

677
00:39:45,834 --> 00:39:48,268
That's a good idea.
- And in the meantime

678
00:39:48,368 --> 00:39:50,918
I can speak to Agatha,
if you like.

679
00:39:52,167 --> 00:39:53,834
Hmm.

680
00:39:59,101 --> 00:40:01,400
The number was everywhere.

681
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,901
You have 23 pairs of shoes.

682
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,001
You're counting my shoes?

683
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:20,067
What are you doing?
- Reading.

684
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:22,167
You're insane.

685
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:38,499
'Night after night I killed

686
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:39,767
Fabrizia in my dreams.

687
00:40:39,867 --> 00:40:42,853
I explained to the department
shrink what her full name...

688
00:40:42,953 --> 00:40:43,634
added up to.'

689
00:40:43,734 --> 00:40:45,734
23.
- What do you think...

690
00:40:45,761 --> 00:40:46,600
that means?

691
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,101
I don't know,
Miles.

692
00:40:51,201 --> 00:40:54,167
Maybe I should be a fucking accountant.

693
00:40:54,167 --> 00:40:56,276
'The wise Dr. Phoenix...

694
00:40:56,376 --> 00:40:57,901
recommends I take a break.'

695
00:40:58,001 --> 00:41:00,533
Maybe you should take a break.

696
00:41:00,533 --> 00:41:01,994
'Like time is gonna...

697
00:41:02,094 --> 00:41:02,433
heal me.'

698
00:41:02,533 --> 00:41:05,201
Time is a-- a gentle man.

699
00:41:05,201 --> 00:41:07,108
'Time is just a counting...

700
00:41:07,208 --> 00:41:07,500
system,

701
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,101
numbers with meaning attached to them.

702
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:12,760
Still, a break is what he prescribes.

703
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:13,867
He called it--'

704
00:41:13,967 --> 00:41:16,634
emotional leave.

705
00:41:16,634 --> 00:41:19,634
So you're not a detective anymore.

706
00:41:19,634 --> 00:41:22,534
'Fabrizia was not impressed.'

707
00:41:22,634 --> 00:41:25,268
I’m a detective on vacation.

708
00:41:27,867 --> 00:41:29,692
And you don't...

709
00:41:29,792 --> 00:41:31,792
have a gun?

710
00:41:33,368 --> 00:41:34,767
I still have these.

711
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:37,517
Maybe you should just get some sleep...

712
00:41:37,617 --> 00:41:39,617
tonight.

713
00:41:50,767 --> 00:41:53,034
'The number was everywhere.

714
00:41:53,134 --> 00:41:54,767
At this point,

715
00:41:54,867 --> 00:41:57,268
I don't need to tell you...

716
00:41:57,268 --> 00:41:59,668
how many pairs of shoes she had.

717
00:42:12,667 --> 00:42:15,667
What are these shoes doing in the trash?

718
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,800
Did you know you had 23 pair?

719
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,268
Oh!

720
00:42:22,268 --> 00:42:24,600
You're insane!

721
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,934
The Hiroshima bomb was dropped at 8:15.

722
00:42:27,934 --> 00:42:31,700
Eight plus 15 is 23.

723
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,600
Waco, Texas,
And the Oklahoma city bombing...

724
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:36,134
both happened on April 19th.

725
00:42:36,134 --> 00:42:38,567
Four plus 19 is 23.

726
00:42:38,567 --> 00:42:41,967
Tropic of cancer,
23.5° north;

727
00:42:41,967 --> 00:42:44,567
Capricorn 23.5° south.

728
00:42:44,567 --> 00:42:48,334
10886 is the number Al Capone wore...

729
00:42:48,334 --> 00:42:51,634
on his uniform in prison.

730
00:42:51,634 --> 00:42:55,084
Ted Bundy was executed on the 23rd of January.

731
00:42:59,734 --> 00:43:02,001
It's all 23.

732
00:43:03,234 --> 00:43:05,367
'She didn't understand,

733
00:43:05,467 --> 00:43:08,242
which was fine because neither did I.

734
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,901
All I knew was...

735
00:43:11,901 --> 00:43:14,234
the number had gone after suicide blonde,

736
00:43:14,334 --> 00:43:16,533
Isabel Lydia Hunt.

737
00:43:21,034 --> 00:43:23,301
Now it was coming after me.'

738
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:26,301
I can speak to Fabrizia if you like.

739
00:43:29,368 --> 00:43:32,143
'I believe he said it...

740
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:34,518
in total innocence at the time.

741
00:43:53,834 --> 00:43:55,834
But looking back...'

742
00:43:55,834 --> 00:43:58,234
I can speak to Fabrizia if you like.

743
00:43:58,334 --> 00:44:01,184
'...I wish I had reacted differently.'

744
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:33,134
'I should have realized the truth.

745
00:44:33,234 --> 00:44:36,368
I know it's absurd,

746
00:44:36,368 --> 00:44:39,668
but even the color of his tie betrayed him.'

747
00:44:45,201 --> 00:44:46,834
Do you know what pink is?

748
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:50,334
Red 27, white 65.
65 plus 27-- 92.

749
00:44:50,334 --> 00:44:52,967
Pink has four letters.
92 divided by four...

750
00:44:53,067 --> 00:44:55,667
Twenty-fucking-three!

751
00:44:57,067 --> 00:45:00,067
In the meantime,
I can speak to Agatha...

752
00:45:00,112 --> 00:45:00,934
if you like.

753
00:45:01,034 --> 00:45:03,431
..paranoia. 23 is very good...

754
00:45:03,531 --> 00:45:03,934
at this...

755
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,767
Paranoia, paranoia.

756
00:45:05,867 --> 00:45:07,801
In the meantime,
I can speak to Agatha...

757
00:45:07,901 --> 00:45:09,934
if you like.

758
00:45:09,934 --> 00:45:12,059
...of an axis of 23°.
When you tell them it's...

759
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:12,801
actually 23.5,

760
00:45:12,901 --> 00:45:16,167
They say five is simply two plus three.

761
00:45:39,134 --> 00:45:40,879
In the meantime,

762
00:45:40,979 --> 00:45:42,467
I can speak to Agatha...

763
00:45:42,567 --> 00:45:45,001
if you like.

764
00:45:55,268 --> 00:45:57,593
'Chapter 21...'

765
00:48:23,167 --> 00:48:25,234
Oh, god!

766
00:48:28,034 --> 00:48:30,034
Ag!

767
00:48:30,667 --> 00:48:33,567
Oh, god!
Oh, god!

768
00:48:39,034 --> 00:48:41,201
It's a nightmare.
It's a nightmare.

769
00:48:41,301 --> 00:48:44,268
It's a nightmare.
It's gonna be all right.

770
00:48:44,368 --> 00:48:46,734
No!

771
00:48:46,734 --> 00:48:48,067
No!

772
00:49:48,433 --> 00:49:51,034
Ag, I don't want you...

773
00:49:51,134 --> 00:49:53,134
to be worried.

774
00:49:53,134 --> 00:49:56,059
I just need one night to clear my head.

775
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,800
Please don't give up on me.

776
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,168
Your loving dog-catching husband,

777
00:50:02,268 --> 00:50:04,268
Walter.

778
00:50:22,001 --> 00:50:23,767
Why that street?

779
00:50:23,867 --> 00:50:26,334
Why that hotel?

780
00:50:27,533 --> 00:50:29,700
Like it was my choice.

781
00:50:53,734 --> 00:50:55,316
Morning.
- What can I do...

782
00:50:55,416 --> 00:50:55,934
for you?

783
00:50:56,034 --> 00:50:59,334
Yeah, um, I’d, um...

784
00:50:59,334 --> 00:51:01,433
Like a room.

785
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:03,433
Sign the register.

786
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,800
27's the quietest.

787
00:51:13,201 --> 00:51:15,800
What about 23?

788
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:19,200
We've been experiencing
some plumbing problems...

789
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:21,300
with 23.

790
00:51:50,834 --> 00:51:54,234
Chapter 22 was as I feared.

791
00:53:13,834 --> 00:53:17,101
Tropic of capricorn.

792
00:53:39,167 --> 00:53:41,167
It wasn't the happiest...

793
00:53:41,233 --> 00:53:41,767
of endings.

794
00:53:41,867 --> 00:53:43,634
It wasn't an ending at all.

795
00:53:43,734 --> 00:53:46,901
After chapter 22,
there was nothing...

796
00:53:46,901 --> 00:53:49,334
but the question.

797
00:53:49,334 --> 00:53:52,334
Did the number live to kill another day?

798
00:53:52,334 --> 00:53:55,109
The number had gone after Fingerling.

799
00:53:55,967 --> 00:53:58,313
and now it was coming after me.

800
00:54:02,834 --> 00:54:04,834
You.

801
00:54:07,734 --> 00:54:11,409
It's all your fault.
If you hadn't made me late...

802
00:54:33,567 --> 00:54:36,600
All right,
this suits me fine.

803
00:54:40,667 --> 00:54:43,667
A place to rest in peace.

804
00:54:45,567 --> 00:54:48,201
Yes!

805
00:54:51,467 --> 00:54:54,334
I got you,
you son of a bitch.

806
00:54:54,334 --> 00:54:56,334
It's okay, boy.

807
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:57,648
You'll get up in a couple of hours

808
00:54:57,748 --> 00:54:58,500
With a bad headache.

809
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,734
That's all.

810
00:55:02,034 --> 00:55:05,634
Not so tough now,
are you, nasty evil dog?

811
00:55:07,067 --> 00:55:09,834
Ned.

812
00:55:09,834 --> 00:55:13,101
L, m, n-- 14.

813
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:16,634
A, b, c, d, e...

814
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,400
Shit.

815
00:55:24,634 --> 00:55:27,467
Ned, Ned!

816
00:55:27,467 --> 00:55:28,867
I’m Father Sebastian.

817
00:55:28,967 --> 00:55:30,600
I trust there's an explanation for this.

818
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,793
He's just sleeping,
Father. I’m an...

819
00:55:32,893 --> 00:55:33,700
animal control officer.

820
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:36,097
Is this your dog?
- It belongs to Barnaby,

821
00:55:36,197 --> 00:55:36,834
My gardener.

822
00:55:36,934 --> 00:55:39,634
Don't worry,
Barnaby, he's all right.

823
00:55:39,684 --> 00:55:41,684
He's just sleeping.

824
00:55:46,067 --> 00:55:48,168
Why did you name him Ned?
- He didn't.

825
00:55:48,268 --> 00:55:50,034
He-- he took Ned in as a stray.

826
00:55:50,134 --> 00:55:53,268
He likes graveyards.
He sits and watches

827
00:55:53,368 --> 00:55:54,034
The stones...

828
00:55:54,134 --> 00:55:57,034
like he was watching over them.

829
00:55:57,034 --> 00:55:58,976
That's how he got his nickname--...

830
00:55:59,076 --> 00:56:00,333
guardian of the dead.

831
00:56:00,433 --> 00:56:02,634
Lately it's been this one.

832
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:09,834
Oh, no way.

833
00:56:09,834 --> 00:56:12,134
What's wrong, son?

834
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,867
She died on her 23rd birthday.

835
00:56:15,867 --> 00:56:17,567
Well, we can only assume.

836
00:56:17,667 --> 00:56:20,934
What?
- That she died.

837
00:56:20,934 --> 00:56:24,001
They never found her body.
This is only a marker.

838
00:56:24,101 --> 00:56:26,549
Where have you been?
- Library. It's not...

839
00:56:26,649 --> 00:56:27,367
just a book.

840
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:30,600
It's true, the number screws with your mind,

841
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:33,400
makes you do...

842
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,967
terrible things.

843
00:56:35,067 --> 00:56:37,901
Perhaps I should be going.

844
00:56:37,901 --> 00:56:41,500
No, I want you to see this, all of you.

845
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,927
There was a college girl named Laura Tollins...

846
00:56:44,027 --> 00:56:44,934
who was murdered.

847
00:56:45,034 --> 00:56:47,234
They never found her body,

848
00:56:47,234 --> 00:56:50,400
but her bed was soaked in so much blood.

849
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,901
This is the man who killed her, Kyle Flinch.

850
00:56:53,001 --> 00:56:54,658
Police found a murder weapon,

851
00:56:54,758 --> 00:56:55,767
a butcher's knife,

852
00:56:55,867 --> 00:56:57,767
with his prints all over it.

853
00:56:57,867 --> 00:56:59,229
Well, Walter,
this was nearly...

854
00:56:59,329 --> 00:56:59,934
15 years ago.

855
00:57:00,034 --> 00:57:02,797
Ag, he wasn't just her psychology professor.

856
00:57:02,897 --> 00:57:03,934
They were lovers.

857
00:57:04,034 --> 00:57:07,268
Everything they did together sexually...

858
00:57:07,268 --> 00:57:09,168
was exactly like the characters in the book.

859
00:57:09,268 --> 00:57:11,967
He said it was her idea to buy the knife.

860
00:57:12,067 --> 00:57:15,867
She wanted to fake an attack.

861
00:57:15,867 --> 00:57:19,867
Kyle Flinch is Topsy Kretts.

862
00:57:19,867 --> 00:57:22,567
The book is his...

863
00:57:22,567 --> 00:57:25,467
warped literary confession.

864
00:57:27,533 --> 00:57:30,400
Agatha said a-a dog told you this.

865
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,634
Ned isn't just a dog.

866
00:57:33,634 --> 00:57:35,884
He's the guardian of the dead.

867
00:57:37,034 --> 00:57:37,951
But what about...

868
00:57:38,051 --> 00:57:38,600
all these 23s...

869
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:40,201
in-in-in your name and everything?

870
00:57:40,301 --> 00:57:42,476
Is it all just a coincidence?

871
00:57:42,526 --> 00:57:44,333
I don't know.

872
00:57:44,433 --> 00:57:46,458
but I know who can tell me.

873
00:58:04,567 --> 00:58:07,201
Well, you're two days early.

874
00:58:09,268 --> 00:58:11,268
You knew I would come?

875
00:58:15,967 --> 00:58:18,134
Reporters always come on the 10th.

876
00:58:18,234 --> 00:58:19,967
The day you killed Laura Tollins.

877
00:58:20,067 --> 00:58:22,901
The day she was taken from me.

878
00:58:22,901 --> 00:58:26,301
I’m not a reporter.
My name is Walter Sparrow.

879
00:58:26,301 --> 00:58:28,600
I was born February 3rd.

880
00:58:30,167 --> 00:58:33,667
Happy belated birthday.

881
00:58:33,667 --> 00:58:36,467
February 3rd.
2/3.

882
00:58:36,467 --> 00:58:38,570
Yeah.
- Don't pretend

883
00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:40,134
You don't know,

884
00:58:40,234 --> 00:58:43,067
Topsy Kretts.
I read your book.

885
00:58:43,067 --> 00:58:45,700
Tell me about the number.

886
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,767
Is that why you killed her?

887
00:58:47,767 --> 00:58:50,467
I need to know.
You have to tell me.

888
00:58:55,667 --> 00:58:59,134
What happened to you?
I’m afraid it's happening to me.

889
00:58:59,234 --> 00:59:01,433
What happened to me?

890
00:59:06,268 --> 00:59:08,305
You want to know the worst thing about...

891
00:59:08,405 --> 00:59:09,234
being in prison?

892
00:59:09,334 --> 00:59:13,101
Your family, your sister,
your parents,

893
00:59:13,101 --> 00:59:15,400
they come to visit you.

894
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,834
Over time, though,
the visits get less...

895
00:59:17,934 --> 00:59:20,634
and your sister stops coming at all.

896
00:59:21,767 --> 00:59:24,204
Then you start to notice
your mother won't look you...

897
00:59:24,304 --> 00:59:24,801
in the eye.

898
00:59:24,901 --> 00:59:27,967
Pretty soon,
she stops coming too.

899
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:30,901
Eventually, your--...

900
00:59:31,001 --> 00:59:33,426
your father tells you your sister...

901
00:59:33,526 --> 00:59:35,300
had a breakdown...

902
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:38,034
unable to deal with having a murderer...

903
00:59:38,134 --> 00:59:39,967
for a brother.

904
00:59:40,067 --> 00:59:41,681
Now there's tears in his eyes when...

905
00:59:41,781 --> 00:59:42,367
he says this,

906
00:59:42,467 --> 00:59:45,867
but he's not sad.

907
00:59:45,867 --> 00:59:48,400
He's angry.

908
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,250
That's the last time you ever see him.

909
00:59:53,734 --> 00:59:56,967
I didn't kill Laura.

910
00:59:56,967 --> 00:59:59,101
I loved her.

911
00:59:59,101 --> 01:00:02,176
And I didn't write a book about a number.

912
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:07,667
You're lying.

913
01:00:07,667 --> 01:00:10,892
I’m in prison for a crime I did not commit,

914
01:00:10,942 --> 01:00:12,942
Mr. Sparrow.

915
01:00:14,268 --> 01:00:16,993
But somehow I think your problems are...

916
01:00:17,093 --> 01:00:19,093
bigger than mine.

917
01:00:20,268 --> 01:00:23,101
Fucking liar!

918
01:00:25,334 --> 01:00:27,901
No.
Yeah, no.

919
01:00:31,001 --> 01:00:33,301
If I was to write a book,

920
01:00:33,301 --> 01:00:37,126
I wouldn't use a ridiculous
name like 'top secrets.'

921
01:01:00,834 --> 01:01:03,034
He was real convincing about his innocence.

922
01:01:03,134 --> 01:01:04,967
Well, killers usually are.

923
01:01:05,067 --> 01:01:07,168
His fingerprints were on the knife.

924
01:01:07,268 --> 01:01:08,733
Her blood was on his hands when...

925
01:01:08,833 --> 01:01:09,467
he dialed 911.

926
01:01:09,567 --> 01:01:13,134
No, he's innocent.

927
01:01:15,967 --> 01:01:18,234
All because his name doesn't add up to 23?

928
01:01:18,334 --> 01:01:20,448
The real killer,
the author, he's still...

929
01:01:20,548 --> 01:01:21,067
out there.

930
01:01:21,167 --> 01:01:23,400
I have to find him.

931
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:26,625
Wait, I--I--I--I know how you can find him.

932
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:34,416
Last night w-when I was...

933
01:01:34,516 --> 01:01:35,467
reading the book,

934
01:01:35,567 --> 01:01:38,492
I found a p.o. box address in the back.

935
01:01:46,167 --> 01:01:48,380
Are you sure you don't want anything in this?

936
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:49,134
Just the snow.

937
01:01:49,234 --> 01:01:51,120
When do you want it to get there?

938
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:52,168
Tomorrow morning.

939
01:01:52,268 --> 01:01:54,767
It'll have to go express.
- Fine.

940
01:01:54,767 --> 01:01:56,234
Is that all?

941
01:01:56,334 --> 01:01:58,368
No no, we want a--...

942
01:01:58,368 --> 01:02:00,934
we want 23 of them.

943
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:08,101
I dreamt that I killed you, Ag.

944
01:02:08,101 --> 01:02:11,239
Fingerling had the same dream about--

945
01:02:11,339 --> 01:02:11,534
Shh.

946
01:02:11,634 --> 01:02:14,533
I’m going with you today.

947
01:02:14,533 --> 01:02:17,308
And all this is gonna come to an end.

948
01:02:19,101 --> 01:02:21,201
You wouldn't hurt me,
Walter.

949
01:02:23,167 --> 01:02:26,600
You wouldn't hurt anyone ever.

950
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,500
How do you know?

951
01:02:41,368 --> 01:02:43,433
There's your boxes,
kiddo.

952
01:02:43,433 --> 01:02:46,268
Now we'll see if somebody shows up.

953
01:02:47,734 --> 01:02:51,634
This may not be the author.
He may not even be a man.

954
01:02:52,001 --> 01:02:55,533
Well, we'll know soon enough.

955
01:03:18,934 --> 01:03:20,934
Walter, look.
- Huh?

956
01:03:20,934 --> 01:03:22,934
Somebody's gone in.

957
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,534
That's him.
I-it's gotta be him.

958
01:03:27,634 --> 01:03:31,101
You think?
- Yeah, I mean, look at him.

959
01:03:31,101 --> 01:03:33,134
It's gotta be him.

960
01:03:39,533 --> 01:03:41,567
Game's over,
Topsy Kretts.

961
01:03:52,167 --> 01:03:55,334
You sh-- should be dead.

962
01:03:57,067 --> 01:03:59,067
You should be dead!

963
01:04:01,433 --> 01:04:04,634
Walter, no!
- I’m calling the cops!

964
01:04:04,634 --> 01:04:07,634
Stop!
Who are you?

965
01:04:07,634 --> 01:04:10,167
The number,
what does it mean?

966
01:04:10,167 --> 01:04:12,734
I think you know.

967
01:04:16,268 --> 01:04:17,410
Oh my god.
Get an ambulance!

968
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:17,901
Watch out!

969
01:04:18,001 --> 01:04:21,967
Dear god.
- Get an ambulance!

970
01:04:21,967 --> 01:04:23,667
Don't you die on me.

971
01:04:23,767 --> 01:04:26,201
You hear me?
Don't you die.

972
01:04:26,201 --> 01:04:28,067
Walter, please.

973
01:04:28,167 --> 01:04:30,387
He's the only person that can help us get...

974
01:04:30,487 --> 01:04:31,268
back to normal.

975
01:04:31,368 --> 01:04:33,201
Honey, you're not helping, okay?

976
01:04:33,301 --> 01:04:35,071
Now I want you to take Robin...

977
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:35,901
and go home.

978
01:04:36,001 --> 01:04:37,767
This man needs a hospital.

979
01:04:37,867 --> 01:04:41,134
I’ll take care of it.
- But he knows, hon.

980
01:04:41,134 --> 01:04:43,301
Take Robin and go home.

981
01:04:43,301 --> 01:04:47,101
I said I’ll take care of it.

982
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:53,934
He knows.

983
01:04:54,034 --> 01:04:56,134
Shit!

984
01:04:56,134 --> 01:04:58,234
Hard to get rid of...

985
01:04:58,234 --> 01:05:01,167
What?
- I was insane.

986
01:05:01,167 --> 01:05:02,734
What was driving you insane?

987
01:05:02,834 --> 01:05:05,667
Hard...

988
01:05:05,667 --> 01:05:08,467
to get rid of...

989
01:05:10,867 --> 01:05:13,301
The institute.

990
01:05:13,301 --> 01:05:16,400
Go there.

991
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:17,967
You'll see.

992
01:05:18,067 --> 01:05:20,700
Oh my god.

993
01:05:32,634 --> 01:05:35,034
Agatha.
- Walter, he didn't make it.

994
01:05:35,134 --> 01:05:36,634
I’m so sorry.

995
01:05:36,734 --> 01:05:38,934
Well, did he say anything?

996
01:05:38,934 --> 01:05:41,901
No, I’m sorry.

997
01:05:41,901 --> 01:05:44,533
Did you find out who he was?

998
01:05:44,533 --> 01:05:47,101
No.

999
01:05:47,101 --> 01:05:50,268
I’ll be home in a little while.

1000
01:07:22,467 --> 01:07:23,767
Oh, shit!

1001
01:07:23,867 --> 01:07:26,533
You gotta be kidding me.

1002
01:07:28,967 --> 01:07:30,967
Robin!

1003
01:08:29,101 --> 01:08:31,934
Every 23rd word on every 23rd page:

1004
01:08:31,934 --> 01:08:35,109
'Visit Casanova spark,
Dig beneath the steps...

1005
01:08:35,209 --> 01:08:37,034
to heaven.'

1006
01:08:37,134 --> 01:08:40,001
Who's Casanova spark?
- It's not a person.

1007
01:08:40,101 --> 01:08:43,326
'I warn you, hell is waiting, Sparrow man.'

1008
01:08:44,467 --> 01:08:46,734
We need to go.

1009
01:09:23,134 --> 01:09:25,134
23!

1010
01:09:38,533 --> 01:09:41,233
What was driving you insane?

1011
01:10:13,667 --> 01:10:16,667
Wanna take bets that there's 23 of them?

1012
01:10:22,334 --> 01:10:25,201
20, 21, 22...

1013
01:10:29,901 --> 01:10:32,226
Are you sure you wanna do this?

1014
01:10:34,533 --> 01:10:38,067
What if mom was right?

1015
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:39,801
Wh-wh-what if-- what if
the man wasn't the author?

1016
01:10:39,901 --> 01:10:42,385
What-- what if he was just the guy's father...

1017
01:10:42,485 --> 01:10:43,201
or something?

1018
01:10:43,301 --> 01:10:45,734
Sounds like a lot of what ifs.

1019
01:10:45,734 --> 01:10:48,759
Wouldn't that mean that the real killer's...

1020
01:10:48,859 --> 01:10:50,859
still out there?

1021
01:10:56,834 --> 01:10:59,867
Did you hear something?

1022
01:11:01,001 --> 01:11:04,001
You're starting to sound like me, kiddo.

1023
01:11:10,667 --> 01:11:13,400
Gimme the light.
Gimme the light.

1024
01:11:16,101 --> 01:11:19,533
Oh, my--

1025
01:11:26,667 --> 01:11:30,567
Okay, we gotta go.
Go!

1026
01:11:30,567 --> 01:11:32,875
Give me the light.
Let's get out...

1027
01:11:32,975 --> 01:11:34,975
of here.

1028
01:11:42,967 --> 01:11:45,292
There's one right there.

1029
01:11:45,391 --> 01:11:45,700
Where?

1030
01:11:50,268 --> 01:11:52,334
You stay here!

1031
01:11:54,334 --> 01:11:57,001
911.
What's your emergency?

1032
01:11:57,001 --> 01:11:59,201
You need to send someone...

1033
01:11:59,201 --> 01:12:01,201
to Casanova's park.

1034
01:12:05,533 --> 01:12:08,767
Is this your idea of a joke?

1035
01:12:08,767 --> 01:12:10,901
It's empty.

1036
01:12:14,667 --> 01:12:16,667
What?

1037
01:12:18,134 --> 01:12:20,467
It was right there.

1038
01:12:20,467 --> 01:12:22,937
We're not crazy.
We circled every 23rd word...

1039
01:12:23,037 --> 01:12:24,067
on every 23rd page...

1040
01:12:24,167 --> 01:12:25,420
and it told us to come down here.

1041
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:25,667
Yeah.

1042
01:12:25,767 --> 01:12:27,728
And I sound completely crazy,

1043
01:12:27,828 --> 01:12:28,333
don't I?

1044
01:12:28,433 --> 01:12:29,524
Just get some sleep, okay?

1045
01:12:29,624 --> 01:12:30,067
We're done here.

1046
01:12:30,167 --> 01:12:32,467
10-23, u.t.l.

1047
01:12:35,834 --> 01:12:37,834
Mom.

1048
01:12:39,467 --> 01:12:41,767
Oh, honey.

1049
01:12:49,067 --> 01:12:52,368
Let's go home, okay?
- Yeah.

1050
01:13:01,834 --> 01:13:04,333
Skeletons can't just get up and walk away.

1051
01:13:04,433 --> 01:13:06,901
You were right.
That man wasn't the killer.

1052
01:13:07,001 --> 01:13:08,700
The real killer is still out there...

1053
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,900
and he knows dad's onto him.

1054
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,901
The book, it's got all these-- these--...

1055
01:13:15,001 --> 01:13:16,901
these secret messages every 23rd page.

1056
01:13:17,001 --> 01:13:18,308
He's right, every 23rd page in the book.

1057
01:13:18,408 --> 01:13:18,901
Stop it!

1058
01:13:19,001 --> 01:13:20,281
Yes.
- Both of you, stop it!

1059
01:13:20,381 --> 01:13:21,168
Now listen to me.

1060
01:13:21,268 --> 01:13:24,433
23 is a number, okay?
There's no magical meaning.

1061
01:13:24,533 --> 01:13:26,001
Only people can give it that.

1062
01:13:26,101 --> 01:13:27,568
And I don't care how many lunatics...

1063
01:13:27,668 --> 01:13:28,734
are fantasizing about 23.

1064
01:13:28,834 --> 01:13:30,901
They're wrong!
There's no curse.

1065
01:13:31,001 --> 01:13:33,767
There's no killer running around out there.

1066
01:13:33,867 --> 01:13:36,342
Jesus.

1067
01:13:40,634 --> 01:13:42,634
It's him.

1068
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:47,234
That's Ned.

1069
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:55,234
Nasty evil dead dog.

1070
01:13:59,734 --> 01:14:03,067
Dad!
- Walter!

1071
01:14:29,867 --> 01:14:31,867
You.

1072
01:14:33,433 --> 01:14:36,067
It was you.

1073
01:14:36,067 --> 01:14:38,067
You moved the skeleton.

1074
01:14:39,967 --> 01:14:41,134
Please don't do this, Walter.

1075
01:14:41,234 --> 01:14:43,559
Then how did you know,
unless...

1076
01:14:47,867 --> 01:14:50,134
Your maiden name is Pink.

1077
01:14:50,134 --> 01:14:51,801
Do you know what pink is?

1078
01:14:51,901 --> 01:14:55,101
Red and white,
92 divided by 4.

1079
01:14:57,067 --> 01:14:58,783
Someday I’m gonna write a book and I’ll do it...

1080
01:14:58,883 --> 01:14:59,500
to somebody else.

1081
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:01,634
Walter.
- Oh, god.

1082
01:15:01,634 --> 01:15:03,067
Whoever wrote it knows you very well,

1083
01:15:03,167 --> 01:15:04,801
and only they can give you your answers.

1084
01:15:04,901 --> 01:15:08,167
You wrote it.

1085
01:15:09,767 --> 01:15:11,268
Isaac knew all along,
didn't he?

1086
01:15:11,368 --> 01:15:14,667
Walter, just let it be, please.

1087
01:15:14,667 --> 01:15:16,367
You're Topsy Kretts.

1088
01:15:16,467 --> 01:15:17,867
He may not even be a man.

1089
01:15:17,967 --> 01:15:21,268
Don't make me do this.
- Why, Ag?

1090
01:15:23,834 --> 01:15:25,867
Why'd you do this?

1091
01:15:27,368 --> 01:15:30,224
Who have I been living with?

1092
01:15:30,324 --> 01:15:32,324
Walter.

1093
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,400
What's this for, Ag?

1094
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:43,667
What were you gonna do with this?

1095
01:15:43,767 --> 01:15:45,534
I--

1096
01:15:45,634 --> 01:15:48,134
I took it to protect us...

1097
01:15:48,134 --> 01:15:51,095
from whoever we were gonna
meet at the mailbox...

1098
01:15:51,195 --> 01:15:51,734
facility.

1099
01:15:51,834 --> 01:15:53,912
Intending to kill that poor
old man who you got...

1100
01:15:54,012 --> 01:15:54,867
to publish your book...

1101
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:56,767
and protect your little secret?

1102
01:15:56,867 --> 01:15:59,570
I’ll take care of it.
- He was alive before...

1103
01:15:59,670 --> 01:16:00,734
you sent us away.

1104
01:16:00,834 --> 01:16:03,395
Robin will hear you.
- Oh, we wouldn't want that,

1105
01:16:03,495 --> 01:16:03,934
would we?

1106
01:16:04,034 --> 01:16:06,310
Wouldn't want our son
to know the horrible truth...

1107
01:16:06,410 --> 01:16:07,201
about his mother.

1108
01:16:07,301 --> 01:16:09,134
Mom, dad, what's going on?

1109
01:16:09,234 --> 01:16:11,101
She's Topsy Kretts.
She wrote the book.

1110
01:16:11,201 --> 01:16:13,770
No, it's not true.
Now your father's gonna...

1111
01:16:13,870 --> 01:16:15,034
put down the knife.

1112
01:16:15,134 --> 01:16:17,734
Aren't you, Walter?
- Tell him the truth.

1113
01:16:17,834 --> 01:16:19,900
Walter.
- Tell him how you took...

1114
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:20,867
the skeleton.

1115
01:16:20,967 --> 01:16:24,134
Yes, Isaac and I took the skeleton.

1116
01:16:24,134 --> 01:16:26,433
You did?
- And I’d do it again.

1117
01:16:26,433 --> 01:16:28,367
But I did not write the book.

1118
01:16:28,467 --> 01:16:30,967
Don't lie.
13 years, Ag.

1119
01:16:30,967 --> 01:16:32,268
13 years of lies!

1120
01:16:32,368 --> 01:16:34,400
No more.
- Don't do this to us, Walter.

1121
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:37,067
Mom, who wrote the book?
- Tell him who wrote it.

1122
01:16:37,167 --> 01:16:40,001
Tell him.

1123
01:16:40,001 --> 01:16:42,500
You wrote the book,
Walter.

1124
01:16:54,667 --> 01:16:57,592
I found this with the old man's things.

1125
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:10,201
You put my name on this.

1126
01:17:10,201 --> 01:17:12,201
No.

1127
01:17:12,867 --> 01:17:15,201
No no no no no.

1128
01:17:15,201 --> 01:17:16,734
You're lying.

1129
01:17:16,834 --> 01:17:19,416
She's lying.
I didn't-- I didn't...

1130
01:17:19,516 --> 01:17:20,300
write that.

1131
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,400
Then who did?

1132
01:17:24,101 --> 01:17:26,101
You.

1133
01:17:27,834 --> 01:17:30,827
It was both of you all the way along,

1134
01:17:30,927 --> 01:17:31,600
wasn't it?

1135
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:34,067
No.
- What is this?

1136
01:17:34,067 --> 01:17:36,067
What are you doing?

1137
01:18:03,433 --> 01:18:05,433
Dad.

1138
01:18:07,167 --> 01:18:09,167
Dad, what's happening?

1139
01:18:12,234 --> 01:18:14,834
Walter, we can get you help.

1140
01:18:17,101 --> 01:18:18,734
The woman in red.

1141
01:18:18,834 --> 01:18:22,134
And this is supposed to make...

1142
01:18:22,184 --> 01:18:24,184
me feel better how?

1143
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:28,533
Oh my god.
Shit!

1144
01:18:33,433 --> 01:18:35,433
Walter.

1145
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:47,533
No!
Get out of here!

1146
01:18:47,533 --> 01:18:49,201
Get your car.
Come on.

1147
01:18:49,301 --> 01:18:51,776
Let's go.
- Come on, honey.

1148
01:20:14,433 --> 01:20:17,101
'Chapter 23:

1149
01:20:17,101 --> 01:20:20,201
You can call me Fingerling,

1150
01:20:20,201 --> 01:20:23,767
but my real name is Walter.

1151
01:20:23,767 --> 01:20:27,567
Walter Paul Sparrow.

1152
01:20:27,567 --> 01:20:30,801
What you have read so far
is not the whole truth.

1153
01:20:30,901 --> 01:20:34,567
Much has been changed to protect the innocent...

1154
01:20:34,567 --> 01:20:36,600
and the guilty.

1155
01:20:42,334 --> 01:20:43,844
I once read that the only philosophical...

1156
01:20:43,944 --> 01:20:44,734
question that matters...

1157
01:20:44,834 --> 01:20:47,567
is whether or not to commit suicide.

1158
01:20:49,134 --> 01:20:51,834
I guess that makes me a philosopher.

1159
01:20:53,967 --> 01:20:56,367
You could say it was my inheritance.

1160
01:20:56,467 --> 01:20:58,967
After my mother's death...

1161
01:20:58,967 --> 01:21:01,167
my father couldn't cope.

1162
01:21:06,134 --> 01:21:08,134
He didn't leave a note.

1163
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:11,500
Just a number.

1164
01:21:13,533 --> 01:21:15,641
That number followed me from foster home...

1165
01:21:15,741 --> 01:21:16,500
to foster home,

1166
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:19,334
till college when I met her.

1167
01:21:19,334 --> 01:21:21,334
Laura Tollins.

1168
01:21:40,467 --> 01:21:42,467
Do it tight.

1169
01:21:44,967 --> 01:21:47,734
Pretend that you have a knife.

1170
01:21:47,734 --> 01:21:49,534
I got a knife.

1171
01:21:49,634 --> 01:21:51,433
Cut my shirt.

1172
01:21:51,533 --> 01:21:53,600
I’ll cut you some more.
- Are you?

1173
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:55,700
Yeah, I’ll cut you.

1174
01:22:08,234 --> 01:22:10,834
Cut me.
Cut me.

1175
01:22:10,834 --> 01:22:14,234
'I loved her.'

1176
01:22:14,234 --> 01:22:16,667
One little-known...

1177
01:22:16,667 --> 01:22:18,734
'And I thought she loved me.'

1178
01:22:18,834 --> 01:22:21,300
...esoteric procession of the number 23.

1179
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:23,834
Does a thing itself have a mystical power?

1180
01:22:23,934 --> 01:22:25,758
Does that equate?
- Yes, that-- that's--...

1181
01:22:25,858 --> 01:22:26,433
that's the...

1182
01:22:26,533 --> 01:22:29,608
'Until my father's number...

1183
01:22:29,658 --> 01:22:31,658
returned to haunt me.'

1184
01:22:44,067 --> 01:22:46,134
Are you insane?

1185
01:22:46,134 --> 01:22:48,984
'That fucking number.'

1186
01:23:10,134 --> 01:23:13,659
'When I circled every
23rd letter of her note...

1187
01:23:14,934 --> 01:23:17,767
it became clear.'

1188
01:23:19,334 --> 01:23:21,700
'The number had gone after me.

1189
01:23:25,334 --> 01:23:28,709
And now it wanted her.'

1190
01:23:31,700 --> 01:23:33,767
Laura, this room-- you gotta get out.

1191
01:23:33,867 --> 01:23:35,485
It's coming for you.
I can't stop it.

1192
01:23:35,585 --> 01:23:35,767
What?

1193
01:23:35,867 --> 01:23:38,800
What?
- The number.

1194
01:23:40,167 --> 01:23:43,634
No no no no no.
- Leave me alone.

1195
01:23:46,234 --> 01:23:48,801
You think you have the guts to use it?

1196
01:23:48,901 --> 01:23:51,901
Go ahead.

1197
01:23:51,901 --> 01:23:54,567
Kill me.

1198
01:23:58,234 --> 01:24:00,234
I love you.

1199
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:05,901
I never loved you,
ever.

1200
01:24:05,901 --> 01:24:09,500
How could I?

1201
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:11,834
How could anyone?

1202
01:24:11,834 --> 01:24:13,834
You're pathetic.

1203
01:24:15,234 --> 01:24:17,368
Just like your father.

1204
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:21,700
Get out!

1205
01:24:31,301 --> 01:24:33,168
Laura.

1206
01:24:33,268 --> 01:24:35,901
Laura!

1207
01:24:35,901 --> 01:24:38,400
Laura!
Laura!

1208
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:39,967
Laura!

1209
01:24:40,067 --> 01:24:43,533
Laura! Laura!

1210
01:24:43,533 --> 01:24:46,500
Laura!
Laura!

1211
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:49,934
Laura! Laura!

1212
01:24:49,934 --> 01:24:53,067
Laura!

1213
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:56,500
I was right.

1214
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:58,834
She was in danger.

1215
01:24:58,834 --> 01:25:01,909
I just didn't realize the danger was me.'

1216
01:25:04,334 --> 01:25:06,967
It's gonna be all right.

1217
01:25:09,934 --> 01:25:13,101
I just didn't realize the danger was me.'

1218
01:25:29,433 --> 01:25:31,901
Hey, Laura.

1219
01:25:36,533 --> 01:25:38,533
Laura?

1220
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:19,101
'What began as a suicide note...

1221
01:26:19,201 --> 01:26:20,667
turned into something more...'

1222
01:26:30,268 --> 01:26:32,268
Shh-- get the--...

1223
01:26:33,634 --> 01:26:36,467
'...much, much more.'

1224
01:26:38,301 --> 01:26:40,301
23.
That's a good one.

1225
01:26:40,301 --> 01:26:42,334
That's a good one.

1226
01:26:49,901 --> 01:26:52,667
23.23.

1227
01:26:52,667 --> 01:26:53,901
23.

1228
01:26:54,001 --> 01:26:57,001
23, 23.
Fuck it, fuck it.

1229
01:26:57,001 --> 01:26:58,268
I can see it.
It's everywhere.

1230
01:26:58,368 --> 01:27:01,700
It's everywhere.
It's everywhere.

1231
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:03,800
No more fun and games.

1232
01:27:05,034 --> 01:27:07,301
Laura.

1233
01:27:18,467 --> 01:27:21,400
Shit!
This fucking...

1234
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:23,433
It's not true.

1235
01:27:23,433 --> 01:27:25,467
It's not true.

1236
01:27:25,467 --> 01:27:28,368
He does not-- does not--

1237
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:34,667
I love you...

1238
01:27:34,667 --> 01:27:36,168
More than any of...

1239
01:27:36,268 --> 01:27:39,001
Period, exclamation.

1240
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:11,433
Remember this?

1241
01:28:37,901 --> 01:28:39,476
'They thought it was...

1242
01:28:39,576 --> 01:28:40,067
the fall...'

1243
01:28:40,167 --> 01:28:42,666
He doesn't remember anything.
It's not uncommon in cases...

1244
01:28:42,766 --> 01:28:43,967
of such severe head injury.

1245
01:28:44,067 --> 01:28:46,551
He could recover his memory tomorrow...

1246
01:28:46,651 --> 01:28:47,234
or never.

1247
01:28:47,334 --> 01:28:49,367
Well, of course you
have to factor in the history...

1248
01:28:49,467 --> 01:28:51,934
of mental instability of the patient's family.

1249
01:28:52,034 --> 01:28:53,934
His own father attempted suicide.

1250
01:28:54,034 --> 01:28:56,250
He just managed to be a little more...

1251
01:28:56,350 --> 01:28:57,400
successful at it.

1252
01:28:57,500 --> 01:28:59,878
'...because the trauma of Laura...

1253
01:28:59,978 --> 01:29:01,168
appeared to be fiction.'

1254
01:29:01,268 --> 01:29:04,067
And all that scribbling?
- Severe graphomania.

1255
01:29:04,167 --> 01:29:06,067
The rantings of a delirious mind.

1256
01:29:06,167 --> 01:29:08,067
Some sort of a survivor's guilt mixed up...

1257
01:29:08,167 --> 01:29:09,667
with a numerology obsession.

1258
01:29:09,767 --> 01:29:12,867
You have your hands full, doctor.

1259
01:29:12,867 --> 01:29:15,500
Mmm.
I’ll do what I can.

1260
01:29:16,634 --> 01:29:19,667
Say, uh, may I have this book?

1261
01:29:19,667 --> 01:29:22,134
Thank you.

1262
01:29:22,134 --> 01:29:24,268
'My novel,

1263
01:29:24,268 --> 01:29:26,134
my confession,

1264

I never saw it again.'
- My name is Dr. Nathaniel.

01:29:36,567 --> 01:29:38,067
So my brain just blocked out...

the terrible thing I had done...

1269
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,800
and the reasons why.'

Take care.

see you again.

1272
01:29:46,134 --> 01:29:49,584
I hope not. I hope not.
Don't come back, fella.

1273
01:29:49,634 --> 01:29:51,634
Okay.

1274
01:29:58,368 --> 01:30:00,937
Ooh! Oh my god.
I’m so sorry.

1275
01:30:01,037 --> 01:30:01,168
Oh!

1276
01:30:01,268 --> 01:30:02,734
Oh, no.

But the number found a new victim.

1283

The number left me alone for 13 years...

1284

until the night she found my book,

1285
01:30:22,967 --> 01:30:25,101
or the book found her.'

1286
01:30:49,167 --> 01:30:51,168
This is where I wrote it all.

1287
01:30:51,268 --> 01:30:54,500
It was me.

1288
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:56,834
I’m a murderer.

1289
01:31:01,433 --> 01:31:03,983
I don't know what happened to you,

1290
01:31:04,033 --> 01:31:06,033
but I do know this:

1291
01:31:06,634 --> 01:31:09,634
You weren't a bad person who got better;

1292
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:13,300
You were a sick person who became well.

1293
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:16,567
I killed Laura Tollins.

1294
01:31:19,433 --> 01:31:22,958
There's an innocent man
in prison because of me.

1295
01:31:23,867 --> 01:31:26,368
You're a wonderful husband,

1296
01:31:26,368 --> 01:31:30,368
and you're the best father
a son could ever have.

1297
01:31:30,368 --> 01:31:33,068
And what would Robin do without you?

1298
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:36,744
You know I can't let an innocent man...

1299
01:31:36,844 --> 01:31:37,500
go on suffering...

1300
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:41,500
for my horrible sin.

1301
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:44,101
We're all broken, Walter.

1302
01:31:44,101 --> 01:31:46,001
Remember, you told me your life started...

1303
01:31:46,101 --> 01:31:48,101
when you met me?

1304
01:31:48,101 --> 01:31:50,734
Well, my life...

1305
01:31:50,734 --> 01:31:52,836
began that day, too.
- You didn't know...

1306
01:31:52,936 --> 01:31:53,467
who I was.

1307
01:31:53,567 --> 01:31:56,101
I didn't know who I was.

1308
01:31:56,101 --> 01:31:58,450
I want you to leave, Ag.

1309
01:31:58,550 --> 01:31:58,700
No.

1310
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,971
You need to leave before...

1311
01:32:01,071 --> 01:32:01,168
No.

1312
01:32:01,268 --> 01:32:03,767
Before what?

1313
01:32:08,034 --> 01:32:10,034
Before you kill me?

1314
01:32:12,467 --> 01:32:14,967
Damn it, Walter.

1315
01:32:14,967 --> 01:32:17,134
Look, this...

1316
01:32:17,134 --> 01:32:19,134
This is who you were.

1317
01:32:19,134 --> 01:32:21,334
This is not who you are.

1318
01:32:23,034 --> 01:32:24,784
This is not who you are!

1319
01:32:24,884 --> 01:32:26,884
I’m a killer!

1320
01:32:27,001 --> 01:32:30,268
I have killed someone.

1321
01:32:30,268 --> 01:32:33,034
I killed someone.

1322
01:32:33,034 --> 01:32:35,034
I could do it again.

1323
01:32:35,034 --> 01:32:37,808
You think you could do it again? You think...

1324
01:32:37,908 --> 01:32:38,934
you're a killer?

1325
01:32:39,034 --> 01:32:40,300
Here, then take this.

1326
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:42,400
You go ahead and do it.

1327
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:44,367
If you're a killer,
then kill me!

1328
01:32:44,467 --> 01:32:45,967
Look around at all the beautiful 23s.

1329
01:32:46,067 --> 01:32:48,007
You don't want to disappoint them,

1330
01:32:48,107 --> 01:32:48,467
do you?

1331
01:32:48,567 --> 01:32:50,367
Do it!

1332
01:32:52,967 --> 01:32:54,834
I love you.

1333
01:32:54,934 --> 01:32:57,967
No, don't you say that.

1334
01:32:59,567 --> 01:33:02,567
I love you.
- No, you can't!

1335
01:33:06,700 --> 01:33:08,767
Nobody can.

1336
01:33:46,467 --> 01:33:48,533
Dad!

1337
01:33:58,034 --> 01:34:00,604
There's no such thing...

1338
01:34:00,704 --> 01:34:01,433
as destiny.

1339
01:34:01,533 --> 01:34:04,008
There are only different choices.

1340
01:34:21,433 --> 01:34:23,967
It's just a number.

1341
01:34:23,967 --> 01:34:27,001
Some choices are easy;

1342
01:34:27,001 --> 01:34:28,801
Some aren't.

1343
01:34:28,901 --> 01:34:31,800
Those are the really important ones,

1344
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:35,134
the ones that define us as people.

1345
01:34:35,134 --> 01:34:38,101
The lord is my shepherd.
there is nothing I lack.

1346
01:34:38,201 --> 01:34:40,834
In green pastures,
you let me graze.

1347
01:34:40,834 --> 01:34:44,500
To safe waters, you lead me.
You restore my...

1348
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:45,651
13 years ago I made...

1349
01:34:45,751 --> 01:34:46,901
the wrong choice...

1350
01:34:47,001 --> 01:34:49,201
Guide me along the right path for the sake...

1351
01:34:49,301 --> 01:34:52,500
I needed to put it right,

1352
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:54,567
and not just for my sake.

1353
01:35:11,001 --> 01:35:14,867
To die there in the street
would have been easy,

1354
01:35:14,867 --> 01:35:17,834
but it wouldn't have been justice,

1355
01:35:17,834 --> 01:35:21,959
at least not the justice
fathers teach their sons about.

1356
01:35:29,934 --> 01:35:32,634
I’ll be sentenced in a week or so.

1357
01:35:32,634 --> 01:35:34,142
My lawyer says the judge will look...

1358
01:35:34,242 --> 01:35:34,834
kindly upon me...

1359
01:35:34,934 --> 01:35:37,400
for turning myself in.

1360
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:40,001
Maybe it's not the happiest of endings,

1361
01:35:40,101 --> 01:35:42,567
but it's the right one.

1362
01:35:44,234 --> 01:35:46,268
Someday I’ll be up for parole...

1363
01:35:46,368 --> 01:35:48,268
and we can go on living our lives.

1364
01:35:48,368 --> 01:35:51,134
It's only a matter of time.

1365
01:35:51,134 --> 01:35:53,034
Of course, time's just a counting system--...

1366
01:35:53,134 --> 01:35:55,301
numbers...

1367
01:35:55,301 --> 01:35:57,551
with meaning attached to them.

1368
01:36:00,700 --> 01:36:03,400
Isn't it?

1369
01:36:04,700 --> 01:37:00,400
