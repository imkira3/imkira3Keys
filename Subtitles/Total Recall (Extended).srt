1
00:01:38,016 --> 00:01:39,976
Wake up!

2
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,312
Wake up!

3
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,416
I cut current!

4
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:04,918
We have about 10 seconds

5
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:07,086
before that alarm
brings an entire team down here.

6
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,338
Here.

7
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,716
- Let's go!
- Go!

8
00:02:16,221 --> 00:02:17,472
Go.

9
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:52,674
Come on!

10
00:03:13,945 --> 00:03:14,946
I love you.

11
00:03:15,947 --> 00:03:17,281
You tell me now?

12
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,084
I love you.

13
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:42,640
Go!

14
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:04,620
No!No!No!

15
00:04:10,877 --> 00:04:12,086
Let go.

16
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:14,255
You have to go now.

17
00:04:14,714 --> 00:04:16,257
- No. I won't leave you.
- Let go.

18
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:17,967
- No.
- I promise I'll find you.

19
00:04:18,051 --> 00:04:19,594
You have to go.

20
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:21,345
Go! Go!

21
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:54,295
You have another nightmare?

22
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:55,505
Yeah.

23
00:04:56,005 --> 00:04:58,758
Baby, what are we going to do with you?

24
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:03,346
I don't know.

25
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:04,514
Do you want to talk about it?

26
00:05:05,515 --> 00:05:07,725
There's nothing to talk about.

27
00:05:10,353 --> 00:05:11,395
Same dream?

28
00:05:14,357 --> 00:05:15,441
Same dream.

29
00:05:18,945 --> 00:05:20,279
Same time.

30
00:05:21,948 --> 00:05:24,408
I'm trapped, being chased.

31
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:26,702
Can't get away.

32
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,080
And then I wake.

33
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:31,457
And that's it?

34
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,585
It's just you, nobody else?

35
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:38,297
No. Just me.

36
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:41,008
Is it me?

37
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:42,802
Is what you?

38
00:05:43,678 --> 00:05:44,887
I don't know.

39
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:49,058
You're alone. You can't get away.

40
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:51,519
Is it us?

41
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:53,688
- Do I make you feel trapped?
- No.

42
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:56,649
Babe,

43
00:05:56,983 --> 00:05:59,151
I know this isn't exactly

44
00:05:59,235 --> 00:06:01,320
what we had in mind when
we were younger, but...

45
00:06:01,404 --> 00:06:02,446
This castle?

46
00:06:04,115 --> 00:06:07,159
Who gets everything
they fantasize about, right?

47
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,914
<i>L</i> 9011 you.

48
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,749
Come here.

49
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:19,463
It's just a dream. That's all it is.

50
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:21,465
Okay?

51
00:06:26,846 --> 00:06:28,681
Well, we're going to have to
get you some better dreams.

52
00:06:29,432 --> 00:06:30,933
That would be nice.

53
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:37,315
Oh, come on.

54
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:41,027
- Shit.
- What is it?

55
00:06:42,862 --> 00:06:44,739
Another bombing in the U.F.B.

56
00:06:44,822 --> 00:06:46,365
Passenger train.

57
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:47,950
Goddamn Resistance.

58
00:06:51,996 --> 00:06:54,332
I'm going to have to
catch the 6:30 departure.

59
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:57,335
They're calling
all emergency personnel to go up top.

60
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,254
I got to go.

61
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:05,760
We'll pick this up tonight, okay?

62
00:07:10,723 --> 00:07:11,974
Try and get a little sleep.

63
00:07:12,475 --> 00:07:13,684
Sleep scares me.

64
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:17,313
Well, dream of me.

65
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:18,564
Okay.

66
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:20,524
But not in these pants.

67
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:27,281
The bomb went off just moments
after the commuters boarded.

68
00:07:30,368 --> 00:07:32,954
We are being told rescue teams
are still searching for survivors.

69
00:07:33,037 --> 00:07:36,582
The death toll is at 144 and still rising.

70
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:40,795
This marks the fourth attack in United
Federation of Britain in as many months.

71
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:44,298
And all signs point
to terrorist leader Matthias

72
00:07:44,382 --> 00:07:46,175
and his Resistance movement.

73
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:49,095
The U. F.B. exploits us.

74
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:52,682
The workers of The Colony deserve equality.

75
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,227
The Fall enslaves us all.

76
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,312
Chancellor Cohaagen
pointed to this as proof

77
00:07:58,396 --> 00:08:00,398
that Matthias does not seek a peaceful path

78
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:04,819
to independence for The Colony,
but rather a prolonged and bloody conflict.

79
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:08,406
And with overpopulation
figures in the U. F.B. continuing to rise,

80
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:10,533
this could not come at a worse time.

81
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:12,743
You'll recall the last attack
occurred six weeks ago.

82
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:17,915
Federal police have since attributed
that bombing to this man, Carl Hauser,

83
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:20,126
a former intelligence officer turned traitor

84
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:22,795
now considered to be
Matthias' right-hand man.

85
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:26,757
No word yet as to whether Hauser
had a role in this morning's incident.

86
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:05,379
Going somewhere? No?

87
00:09:05,463 --> 00:09:07,173
Well, don't let that stop you.

88
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:10,051
That fantasy that remains
forever out of reach?

89
00:09:10,176 --> 00:09:11,510
Not anymore.

90
00:09:11,594 --> 00:09:13,387
At Rekall, we'll provide you

91
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,223
with a complete set
of memories all your own.

92
00:09:16,307 --> 00:09:17,266
Rekall.

93
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:19,477
We can remember it for you.

94
00:09:31,197 --> 00:09:34,992
All passengers, please report
to your designated gates.

95
00:09:35,785 --> 00:09:39,371
This is the final boarding call
for the 7:15 departure.

96
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:58,182
Wake up to the truth!

97
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,851
Cohaagen is counting on your complacency.

98
00:10:00,935 --> 00:10:03,062
Don't let them ship you
across the Earth like cattle.

99
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:04,647
Come on, move.

100
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:09,276
Matthias speaks the truth!

101
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,778
The Fall enslaves us all!

102
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:16,033
- Hey, buddy. You look like shit, man.
- All section A departures are located...

103
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:17,535
- Thanks.
- No offense.

104
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:20,162
I feel like shit. None taken.

105
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:22,706
I ain't sleeping so well, man.

106
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,042
Yeah, these new shifts
are kicking my ass, too.

107
00:10:25,376 --> 00:10:27,837
At least the extra pay
lets the missus rest easier.

108
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:29,880
Look at you.

109
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:32,550
Mr. Glass-is-half-full at 6:00 a.m.

110
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:34,677
Hola. Privyet.

111
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,470
Welcome to The Fall.

112
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:39,265
7:21 a.m.

113
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,727
Travel time to United Federation of Britain:
17 minutes.

114
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:46,230
Dropping in 60 seconds.

115
00:10:47,148 --> 00:10:48,816
Has it ever occurred to you

116
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:51,902
that we always sit in these exact same seats?

117
00:10:52,278 --> 00:10:54,196
For years now... Why?

118
00:10:54,572 --> 00:10:56,073
I don't know.

119
00:10:56,407 --> 00:10:58,242
They're seats. We have asses.

120
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:00,661
Seems like the logical thing to do.

121
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:03,706
I'm talking about us following
the same routine, all right,

122
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:07,001
day after day, year after year
without even questioning it.

123
00:11:09,587 --> 00:11:10,838
Want to switch it up?

124
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:12,006
No sweat.

125
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:15,342
Please make sure
all personal belongings are stored

126
00:11:15,426 --> 00:11:18,137
below your seat before departure.

127
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,514
Oh, yeah.

128
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,645
Much more happening on this side.

129
00:11:27,188 --> 00:11:28,189
Good call.

130
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:29,356
- Dick.
- The Fall dropping in

131
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,651
four, three, two, one.

132
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,236
Have a nice day.

133
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:49,710
Despite recent talks
between Chancellor Cohaagen

134
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,253
and The Colony's governor,

135
00:11:51,337 --> 00:11:53,797
the Chancellor has announced
that he will be stopping

136
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:57,635
all humanitarian aid to The Colony
in light of this morning's bombing.

137
00:11:57,927 --> 00:12:01,680
As much as I want to focus our efforts
on cleaning up The Colony,

138
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:05,726
today's terrorist attacks means that funding

139
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:10,230
will have to go to bolstering
our synthetic federal police force.

140
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:14,652
The protection of our citizens
will always come first.

141
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,195
Approaching core.

142
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:19,365
Please prepare for gravity reversal.

143
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:55,442
Security elevated to level three.
Please remain in scanners until cleared.

144
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:02,658
Looks like that bomb set off
a hell of a panic up here.

145
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:08,497
Identification documents must be in hand
and ready to present to the security officer

146
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,000
before entering the screening area.

147
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:19,258
All factory personnel must enter
through security gate 12.

148
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:25,472
Hey, what do you know about Rekall?

149
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,017
- That mind-altering shit?
- Yeah.

150
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:30,811
Do yourself a favor, Doug,
stay away from them.

151
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:32,312
Why is that?

152
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:33,981
Remember Travis from shift three?

153
00:13:34,273 --> 00:13:37,109
- Travis.
- Went to Rekall for his bachelor party.

154
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,529
Wanted to be king of Mars or some shit.

155
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,114
I'd like to go to Mars.

156
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:44,700
Got himself lobotomized.

157
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,202
Any available biometric tech,
please report to the...

158
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:48,495
- You believe those stories?
-...central office...

159
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:50,289
- About Rekall?
- Yeah.

160
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:51,832
Yeah, I do.

161
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:55,335
Come on.

162
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,088
You never thought about it, just a little bit?

163
00:13:58,172 --> 00:13:59,256
I don't need to think about it.

164
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,051
Don't mess with your mind, man.

165
00:14:02,301 --> 00:14:03,510
It ain't worth it.

166
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:04,762
All right, all right, listen up.

167
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,597
Maybe I need my mind messed with.

168
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,973
We're starting double shifts again.

169
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:09,850
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey-

170
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:11,852
- Don't blame me.
- Fuck me.

171
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:14,688
I don't want to be here
any longer than you do, okay?

172
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:16,315
They've increased
the production of police synthetics

173
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:17,775
thanks to that shit this morning, so...

174
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:19,401
So take all your complaints

175
00:14:19,485 --> 00:14:21,361
to Chancellor Cohaagen.

176
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,989
Now, which one of you
fine, upstanding assholes

177
00:14:24,073 --> 00:14:25,115
wants to train the new guy?

178
00:14:25,616 --> 00:14:26,617
Come on.

179
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:28,368
Hey.

180
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,661
Come on.

181
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,165
Don't look at me.

182
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:35,417
I trained the last guy you fired.

183
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:39,463
- Quaid.
- Yeah.

184
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:41,006
You're up.

185
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,927
- Great. Thank you.
- Any time.

186
00:14:46,637 --> 00:14:48,472
Synthetics coming down!

187
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:51,642
Section three weld scanners are
temporarily offline.

188
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:03,070
Don't hold it like that.

189
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:04,363
Hold it here.

190
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:06,490
If you hold it there and the synth shorts,

191
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:08,742
one of those bolts
will shoot straight through your hand.

192
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,327
No Shit, huh?

193
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:12,496
No shit.

194
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:15,958
Easier ways to get a day off.

195
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,168
Thanks.

196
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:22,631
Hey, you know, your friend
was wrong, by the way.

197
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:24,174
About Rekall.

198
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:26,593
What, you've done it?

199
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:28,011
Been three times already.

200
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:29,471
Really?

201
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:31,348
Best memories I have.

202
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:33,517
A whole lot better than this shit.

203
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:36,520
Hey.

204
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:39,356
Ask for Mac.

205
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:42,192
Okay? You're going to thank me.

206
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:49,283
Level nine,
please report to Human Resources.

207
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:55,205
Strap yourself in.
This guy's a laugh-a-minute.

208
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:57,374
Next.

209
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:02,462
Here you are. Please, have a seat.

210
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:06,925
You work on the production line.

211
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:09,219
In activation, yeah.

212
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:11,388
I understand you live in The Colony.

213
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,307
Yeah, I make the commute
like everyone else.

214
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:16,101
Sorry, who are you?
If you don't mind my asking.

215
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:18,896
- I'm with the Cohaagen administration.
- I see.

216
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:26,153
Given these politically charged times,
there is a heightened concern regarding the,

217
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:30,324
shall we say, loyalty of our workers.

218
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:32,951
- Yeah, but I don't work for you.
- But you do.

219
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:35,579
This company was granted
the government contract for police synths,

220
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:39,917
and we are, the last time I checked,
the government.

221
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:44,296
Okay, I see. So you brought me in here
because of where I live.

222
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:45,714
We're bringing in all the employees.

223
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:48,592
Oh, really? Who's questioning the suits?

224
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:50,385
Who gets to question you?

225
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:51,595
Mr. Quaid,

226
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:57,351
in your capacity here, you are privy to police
synth technology that is currently classified.

227
00:16:57,434 --> 00:17:00,479
I know how to turn 'em on,
if that's what you mean.

228
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:03,315
We'd like you to sign this.

229
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,025
And what is that?

230
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:08,362
It affirms that you will not
divulge proprietary technology

231
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:10,447
to any source, either foreign or domestic.

232
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,616
And that you are not actively engaged

233
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:16,203
in any attempt to overthrow
this administration.

234
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:18,872
You want me to sign something
that says I'm not a terrorist?

235
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:22,668
The document merely affirms
you are who you say you are.

236
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:24,086
And if I were a terrorist,

237
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:26,254
you think this would make me tell you?

238
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:27,965
- Is that your guy's big plan?
- Mr. Quaid...

239
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,383
You catch anyone yet?

240
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:32,094
I have 75 more of these interviews today.

241
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:33,887
Yeah, you know what, pal?
I had a long day, too.

242
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:38,475
Well, if you'd like to have another,
you'll shut up and do what you're told.

243
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:41,561
Wow.

244
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:46,441
Second page at the bottom.

245
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:50,237
You like your job?

246
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,864
I'm a people person.

247
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:56,243
Thank you.

248
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:00,789
Next.

249
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:03,583
Gates nine through 18 now closed.

250
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:06,044
Section A departures will reopen in 40...

251
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:15,655
All right, finally.

252
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:17,240
- Cheers. Salud.
- Yeah. Jesus.

253
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:18,700
Hey, buddy.

254
00:19:18,784 --> 00:19:20,494
- Hey.
- Glad you called.

255
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:21,661
Needed a drink.

256
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:23,663
Lori working tonight?

257
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:25,582
Yeah.

258
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,417
Hey, Murray. Same.

259
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:33,590
You ever learn how to play the piano?

260
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:35,842
Yeah, I always wanted
to learn to play the piano.

261
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:40,013
What's with you today?

262
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:41,848
What?

263
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:43,558
Yeah, exactly.

264
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,185
You've been zoned out all day.

265
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:52,150
I've been having these dreams.

266
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:53,735
Dreams?

267
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:55,821
Yeah, feels

268
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:58,698
like I'm doing something...

269
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:00,367
Something...

270
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:03,203
Something that matters,
something important, you know?

271
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,456
Nope, not so much.

272
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:10,794
You don't think what we do is important?

273
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:17,008
Really? Come on, Harry.

274
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:20,887
We commute halfway
around the world for shit jobs,

275
00:20:20,971 --> 00:20:25,308
for shit pay, to come to this shit bar
and get drunk on too much shit beer.

276
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,728
- No offense, Murray.
- Yeah.

277
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:34,192
What? Are you actually happy
with how your life's turned out?

278
00:20:35,152 --> 00:20:37,404
- Why the hell shouldn't I be?
- Are you serious?

279
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:38,655
Is there something wrong with it?

280
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,615
No. You know what? You're right. Forget it.

281
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:42,075
I'm just...

282
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:44,119
Forget it.

283
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:45,328
Who's the girl?

284
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:47,581
What do you mean?

285
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:49,499
You heard me. Who's the girl?

286
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:52,752
There's no girl. It's just me.

287
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:54,963
Good.

288
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:59,593
'Cause women like Lori
don't just fall out of the sky.

289
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:02,345
You're a lucky man.

290
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:05,974
You're living the dream, my friend.

291
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:07,100
- Really?
- Yeah, man.

292
00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:08,518
- I'm living the dream?
- Yeah.

293
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:16,026
All right, big guy. Tomorrow.

294
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:18,278
Hey.

295
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:21,198
My advice?

296
00:21:21,531 --> 00:21:22,699
Go ahead.

297
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:27,287
Figure out a way to deal with
whatever the hell it is you're going through

298
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,956
before you mess your shit up for good.

299
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:34,878
It's possible I might have drank too much.

300
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:37,255
Yeah, it's possible, Harry.

301
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:40,050
I'm going to go throw up on something now.

302
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,385
- Okay.
- And you're going to get your shit together

303
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:45,055
and go home to your wife, you hear me?

304
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:47,515
Yeah, I think everyone heard you, Harry.

305
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:52,187
Night, Dougie.

306
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:54,231
Good night.

307
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:52,122
Seem like you're looking for something.

308
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:54,624
Is it this?

309
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:58,169
Anything goes here.

310
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,631
Trust me, baby,
you're gonna wish you had three hands.

311
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:04,092
I'm looking for Rekall.

312
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:06,052
You know where I can find it?

313
00:23:06,136 --> 00:23:08,388
Stairway to heaven, over there.

314
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:13,643
Sure I can't change your mind?
I'm a lot more interactive.

315
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:16,146
I bet.

316
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:18,106
Thank you.

317
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:53,391
Welcome to Rekall.

318
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:55,852
First time?

319
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:57,854
Yeah. That obvious, huh?

320
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,606
It's fine.

321
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:01,566
There's nothing to be afraid of.

322
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:03,568
This is a safe place.

323
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:09,824
My friend Marek gave me this card,
told me to ask for Mac.

324
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:19,376
- He's right inside.
- Thanks.

325
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:33,807
Remember to have a good time.

326
00:24:40,063 --> 00:24:41,147
Welcome.

327
00:24:41,356 --> 00:24:42,399
Hey.

328
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:44,401
You're a friend of Marek's.

329
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:46,027
Yes.

330
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:49,572
Yeah, we work together.

331
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:51,866
Is that it?

332
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:54,494
That is it.

333
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:56,413
And it feels like real life?

334
00:24:57,914 --> 00:25:00,166
What is life but our brain's
chemical perception of it?

335
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:03,461
Your eyes see, your brain chemistry reacts.

336
00:25:03,545 --> 00:25:06,172
Here, we just remove the middleman
and we go straight to the chemistry.

337
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:08,174
Does that make it any less real?

338
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:12,470
An illusion, no matter how convincing,
is still just an illusion.

339
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:14,180
That's very good.

340
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:15,974
You're right, objectively.

341
00:25:16,975 --> 00:25:18,768
But from the inside,

342
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,603
subjectively...

343
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:23,189
I assure you, it's quite the opposite entirely.

344
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,983
Listen, I get it.

345
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:26,151
I get it.

346
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:28,027
You're here because
you feel like something's missing.

347
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:31,197
You got some tug, some longing
for something more.

348
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:33,032
We're going to give you that thing.

349
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:34,284
Is that right?

350
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,912
Could be something
you could never afford to do.

351
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:42,083
Something secret you've always wanted
to try, but you would never, ever dare.

352
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:43,877
What do you mean, secret?

353
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,128
Anything.

354
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:47,797
Tell us your fantasy.
We'll give you the memory.

355
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:50,383
You want to be rich and famous?

356
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:51,843
Worshiped by millions?

357
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,845
Maybe something
with a little more adrenaline, huh?

358
00:25:53,928 --> 00:25:56,681
Crime fighter? Or world-class athlete?

359
00:25:57,432 --> 00:25:59,726
Secret agent. That's you. Right?

360
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:01,311
Clandestine bank accounts,

361
00:26:01,478 --> 00:26:02,979
-coded messages.
- Secret agent.

362
00:26:03,354 --> 00:26:04,689
I could do that.

363
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:06,691
Yeah, as an intelligence operative.

364
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,860
You could be working for the Resistance.

365
00:26:09,152 --> 00:26:11,696
Maybe you work for Cohaagen.

366
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:13,531
Or why limit yourself? Why not both?

367
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:20,121
One last thing, Doug.

368
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:22,499
As a matter of full disclosure,

369
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:27,337
none of the secret life elements
you chose can actually be true.

370
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:31,466
See, the thing is, a lot of guys

371
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:33,510
come in here, they want
the secret mistress trip

372
00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:35,929
when they already have one,
a real one, on the side.

373
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:37,055
We can't do that.

374
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:39,807
It would cause
irreparable conflict and confusion.

375
00:26:39,891 --> 00:26:41,768
That's how brains get blown.

376
00:26:41,851 --> 00:26:43,728
Don't worry, I don't have any secrets.

377
00:26:43,895 --> 00:26:45,605
I'm sure you don't, but just in case,

378
00:26:45,688 --> 00:26:47,774
we're going to run
a psycho-polygraphic panel on you anyway.

379
00:26:47,857 --> 00:26:49,025
Marcus, go.

380
00:27:03,498 --> 00:27:05,250
You're going to have such a good time,

381
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:07,669
you're not going to want to come back.

382
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:11,548
Look at that.

383
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:15,093
Looks like your wife
does have a man who appreciates her.

384
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:16,844
No conflict there.

385
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:21,057
Sorry. Still the best way
to get chemicals into the human body.

386
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:25,144
All right.

387
00:27:25,228 --> 00:27:26,896
Let's get this show on the road.

388
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:29,107
Get ready to save the world.

389
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:34,779
Happy trails, man.

390
00:27:34,904 --> 00:27:37,407
You can tell me all about it when you get...

391
00:27:37,824 --> 00:27:39,033
Wait.

392
00:27:39,117 --> 00:27:40,326
What?

393
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:41,411
Shit.

394
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:42,495
Shit? What is it? What's wrong?

395
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:44,664
Yank that needle out before it takes.

396
00:27:45,248 --> 00:27:46,332
What is it? What's wrong?

397
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:47,750
- You lied.
- Lied about what?

398
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:49,669
- Son of a bitch.
- Look, I don't have a mistress.

399
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:50,753
- What are you talking about?
- Mistress?

400
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:51,921
You're a goddamn spy.

401
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:54,299
Vitals are everywhere.

402
00:27:54,966 --> 00:27:56,467
Why are you here? Why?

403
00:27:57,635 --> 00:27:59,262
Federal police!

404
00:28:05,685 --> 00:28:07,520
- Federal police! On your feet now!
- No, wait!

405
00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:09,230
This is all a mistake! It's all...

406
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:11,524
I'm nobody.

407
00:28:12,817 --> 00:28:14,986
- I'm nobody.
- Hands on your head now!

408
00:28:15,153 --> 00:28:16,237
Okay.

409
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:20,325
Turn around!

410
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:23,953
Okay.

411
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:46,851
Holy shit.

412
00:28:51,606 --> 00:28:54,400
118.5, code six. 105 north...

413
00:28:58,363 --> 00:28:59,447
Go!

414
00:28:59,697 --> 00:29:00,948
Move, move, move!

415
00:29:01,032 --> 00:29:02,241
Federal police!

416
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,964
Team one, have you

417
00:29:17,048 --> 00:29:18,216
secured the suspect?

418
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:21,177
Team one, advise.
Let me know what's going on in there.

419
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:24,847
Stevens, get an eyeball in there now.

420
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:25,366
Shit. They're all down.

421
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:26,617
He's all alone!

422
00:30:26,701 --> 00:30:28,286
Let's punch it.

423
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:45,136
Fall back! Fall back!

424
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,597
Cover the exit!

425
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:21,589
In what is being described

426
00:31:21,672 --> 00:31:25,218
as a terrorist attack,
a solitary gunman opened fire

427
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:30,097
on a squadron of federal police
at the Rekall Lounge in downtown Fremont.

428
00:31:30,181 --> 00:31:31,307
We are still awaiting word

429
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,435
-on precisely how many casualties there are.
- Yes.

430
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:36,270
- But officials now confirming...
- Okay.

431
00:31:36,354 --> 00:31:38,272
...that at least 20 officers have been killed...

432
00:31:38,356 --> 00:31:40,024
Oh, my God, Doug.

433
00:31:40,191 --> 00:31:41,609
I understand. Yeah.

434
00:31:42,777 --> 00:31:43,945
- Thank you.
- Lon.

435
00:31:44,487 --> 00:31:47,156
- I'm so glad you're here.
- Of course I'm here.

436
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,449
I've been going out of my mind.

437
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:49,951
Where have you been?

438
00:31:50,034 --> 00:31:51,953
Look, something bad has happened.

439
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:53,454
No, I know. I just got the call.

440
00:31:53,538 --> 00:31:54,622
We've all been put on standby.

441
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,874
You don't understand.

442
00:31:58,084 --> 00:31:59,210
What?

443
00:32:06,467 --> 00:32:07,593
Oh, my God.

444
00:32:10,263 --> 00:32:11,889
Doug, are you okay?

445
00:32:11,973 --> 00:32:15,935
Lori, it wasn't the Resistance
who killed those sentries.

446
00:32:16,018 --> 00:32:17,603
It wasn't terrorists.

447
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:19,313
It was me.

448
00:32:20,022 --> 00:32:21,065
What was you?

449
00:32:21,524 --> 00:32:23,150
Lori, I'm the one who killed them.

450
00:32:25,194 --> 00:32:27,154
You killed 20 armed men?

451
00:32:27,238 --> 00:32:29,407
No. No, it was more like ten.

452
00:32:30,324 --> 00:32:32,118
But you killed them?

453
00:32:32,243 --> 00:32:33,369
With what, honey, your book?

454
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,997
- Lori, look, I'm serious.
- Doug, you're scaring me!

455
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:37,623
I'm sorry.

456
00:32:40,251 --> 00:32:42,169
This is going to sound crazy, okay?

457
00:32:42,253 --> 00:32:43,546
I went to Rekall after work.

458
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:44,922
- And. ..
- What?

459
00:32:45,006 --> 00:32:46,340
- What did they do to you?
- Nothing.

460
00:32:46,424 --> 00:32:49,343
Nothing.
I sat in the chair, they hooked me up.

461
00:32:49,427 --> 00:32:51,554
Before they could do anything,
the police burst in.

462
00:32:52,096 --> 00:32:54,015
They tried to take me.

463
00:32:54,098 --> 00:32:55,474
And I just reacted.

464
00:32:58,185 --> 00:32:59,520
And I killed them.

465
00:32:59,604 --> 00:33:01,731
Listen, you didn't kill anyone, Doug.

466
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:04,609
Trust me, I killed everyone.

467
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:07,111
No, sweetheart, don't you see?

468
00:33:07,945 --> 00:33:10,781
Whatever you think you did
had nothing to do with any of this.

469
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,575
Those assholes screwed with your mind,

470
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:15,995
and now you're having some
kind of a paranoid delusion.

471
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:18,289
Those places are really dangerous.

472
00:33:18,456 --> 00:33:21,709
Whatever it is that happened,
we're going to get through it.

473
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:23,461
Come here. Come on.

474
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:25,087
Come on.

475
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:26,964
It happened so fast.

476
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,593
It's okay, we'll figure it out.

477
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:35,890
I'm sorry.

478
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:42,271
Lori, I can't breathe.

479
00:33:42,355 --> 00:33:43,606
Come on.

480
00:33:50,112 --> 00:33:51,614
What the hell are you doing?

481
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:03,834
Lori, what the fuck...

482
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,300
Lori, what the...

483
00:34:29,151 --> 00:34:30,653
Lori, goddamn it, what are you doing?

484
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:32,154
My Job.

485
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:33,572
Are you crazy?

486
00:34:33,656 --> 00:34:35,157
Am I crazy?

487
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:37,159
That's a good one, Doug.

488
00:34:37,785 --> 00:34:40,037
Considering you don't even know
who the hell you are.

489
00:34:41,414 --> 00:34:43,582
Do you really believe
a factory worker could take out

490
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:45,334
an entire room of highly-trained men?

491
00:34:58,514 --> 00:35:00,516
Tell me what is going on.

492
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:01,767
Talk!

493
00:35:01,851 --> 00:35:05,187
Or we can skip straight to
"Until death do us part."

494
00:35:07,857 --> 00:35:09,525
I'm not your wife.

495
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,029
That's bullshit.
We've been married seven years.

496
00:35:14,155 --> 00:35:17,366
I'm U.F.B. police intel,
assigned to play your wife.

497
00:35:18,117 --> 00:35:19,702
Six weeks ago, I didn't even know you.

498
00:35:22,246 --> 00:35:23,414
What are you talking about?

499
00:35:24,373 --> 00:35:25,708
It's true.

500
00:35:26,584 --> 00:35:29,378
Your memory was erased,
your mind was implanted

501
00:35:29,462 --> 00:35:31,922
with a life you think you've lived.

502
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:33,966
You keeping up, baby?

503
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:36,635
There is no Douglas Quaid, there never was.

504
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:37,887
Are you saying I don't...

505
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,180
This...

506
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,140
Every... Our marriage...

507
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:42,933
What can I say? I give good wife.

508
00:35:43,017 --> 00:35:44,143
Come on.

509
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,103
Deep down, did you really believe

510
00:35:46,187 --> 00:35:48,564
someone like me
would marry someone like you,

511
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:50,107
live in this shithole?

512
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:55,571
If I'm not me, then who the hell am I?

513
00:35:56,614 --> 00:35:58,240
How would I know?

514
00:35:58,407 --> 00:35:59,492
I just work here.

515
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,285
Speculate.

516
00:36:01,911 --> 00:36:03,162
If I had to guess,

517
00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:06,832
all the trouble Cohaagen's taken
to hide you from the Resistance,

518
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:09,084
you must be fairly important.

519
00:36:10,127 --> 00:36:12,671
And with your skill set, I think it's highly
doubtful you're his gardener.

520
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:15,466
Cohaa...

521
00:36:16,634 --> 00:36:18,802
Cohaagen's trying to hide me?

522
00:36:19,303 --> 00:36:20,638
Why are you trying to kill me?

523
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:23,974
Talk!

524
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:27,269
Call it seven-year itch, Doug.

525
00:36:29,772 --> 00:36:34,193
And by the way, you haven't even
begun to see me try to kill you!

526
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:54,129
No!

527
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:01,053
Shit.

528
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:04,473
Team three, break position.

529
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:06,850
I need you on-site now.

530
00:38:32,102 --> 00:38:33,562
Glide two seven, understood.

531
00:38:43,614 --> 00:38:44,907
Shit.

532
00:38:57,294 --> 00:38:58,462
Move!

533
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:04,259
Shit.

534
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:07,971
I want his phone back on the grid now.

535
00:39:08,597 --> 00:39:09,640
Hey!

536
00:39:40,504 --> 00:39:41,588
Move!

537
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:21,545
Hello?

538
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:22,671
Hello.

539
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:24,047
It's Hammond.

540
00:40:24,131 --> 00:40:25,132
I don't know any Hammond.

541
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:26,216
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

542
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:27,426
You said this might happen.

543
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:29,928
Look, find a piece of glass.

544
00:40:30,012 --> 00:40:31,555
Put your hand to it.

545
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:32,973
Do it now.

546
00:40:41,857 --> 00:40:42,858
Oh, Jesus.

547
00:40:44,026 --> 00:40:45,652
They really did
a number on you, didn't they?

548
00:40:45,736 --> 00:40:46,862
Who the hell are you?

549
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:49,615
You honestly don't remember
any of it, do you?

550
00:40:50,032 --> 00:40:51,158
No. No, I don't.

551
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:52,493
Remember what? How do you know me?

552
00:40:52,576 --> 00:40:54,745
We worked at federal intel together.

553
00:40:55,037 --> 00:40:57,164
Look, there isn't much time.

554
00:40:57,247 --> 00:40:59,249
You said to me
that if you ever pop back on the grid,

555
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:00,459
I was to phone this number.

556
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:01,835
The grid?

557
00:41:02,044 --> 00:41:03,420
Your phone.

558
00:41:03,504 --> 00:41:05,380
It's been reactivated.

559
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:07,925
How do you think
they've been tracking you?

560
00:41:08,008 --> 00:41:09,551
Look, you asked me to give you a message,

561
00:41:09,635 --> 00:41:11,720
so I'm giving it to you. Get the key.

562
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:13,889
The key? What is the key?

563
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,182
You said you'd know.

564
00:41:15,265 --> 00:41:17,309
Yeah, well, I don't! So tell me what it is.

565
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:19,853
Look, I know we were close,

566
00:41:19,937 --> 00:41:21,522
but this is getting too dangerous.

567
00:41:21,605 --> 00:41:23,565
If they find out I've contacted you, I'll be...

568
00:41:23,649 --> 00:41:26,818
Just... Just tell me what's going on.

569
00:41:26,902 --> 00:41:28,195
All right, who is it you think I am?

570
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:30,113
Henry.

571
00:41:30,531 --> 00:41:32,741
Henry, okay, good. Henry, who?

572
00:41:32,908 --> 00:41:34,701
Look, there isn't any time.

573
00:41:34,785 --> 00:41:36,828
If I were you, I'd get rid of that phone.

574
00:41:36,912 --> 00:41:38,830
- All right? Now.
- How can I get rid of the phone?

575
00:41:38,914 --> 00:41:40,249
It's in my goddamn hand. How am I...

576
00:41:40,332 --> 00:41:41,667
Hey, wait.

577
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:55,514
10549. 10549.

578
00:42:12,698 --> 00:42:13,865
Come on.

579
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:31,174
Holy shit.

580
00:42:32,009 --> 00:42:33,385
What is that?

581
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:34,511
Where can I get one?

582
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:47,274
- What the hell?
- Yo, come on.

583
00:42:57,284 --> 00:42:58,952
Hey, Robo-dick, that's mine!

584
00:43:03,165 --> 00:43:05,167
Going somewhere? No?

585
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:06,835
Well, don't let that stop you.

586
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:09,713
That fantasy that remains
forever out of reach?

587
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:11,006
Not anymore.

588
00:43:11,715 --> 00:43:15,761
At Rekall, we'll provide you with
a complete set of memories all your own.

589
00:43:17,304 --> 00:43:18,513
Rekall.

590
00:43:19,056 --> 00:43:21,183
We can remember it for you.

591
00:43:22,893 --> 00:43:24,311
Come inside! We have hot food for you.

592
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:33,111
Quaid must've known we'd be tracking it.

593
00:43:34,446 --> 00:43:37,074
How the hell would he have known that?

594
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:43,163
Oh, shit.

595
00:43:48,085 --> 00:43:49,795
He made you look like a fool.

596
00:43:49,878 --> 00:43:51,671
He'd had major tactical training, sir.

597
00:43:51,755 --> 00:43:52,839
I wasn't made aware of that.

598
00:43:53,382 --> 00:43:55,300
How the hell did he get activated?

599
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:58,428
An agent in place
told me he'd gone to Rekall.

600
00:43:58,512 --> 00:44:01,598
I sent a team in, but his memory implant
had been blown before they could get to him.

601
00:44:02,015 --> 00:44:03,350
I'm 15 minutes behind him.

602
00:44:03,433 --> 00:44:05,352
Neutralize only, do you understand me?

603
00:44:05,894 --> 00:44:07,062
No lethal force.

604
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:09,564
I want him alive for re-implantation.

605
00:44:11,483 --> 00:44:12,901
Who the hell is this guy, sir?

606
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,655
Take me off display.

607
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:25,831
Line is secure.

608
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,003
Are you fucking kidding me?

609
00:44:33,088 --> 00:44:34,297
Why is he still alive?

610
00:44:38,844 --> 00:44:40,095
Yes, sir.

611
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:49,020
- We kill him on sight.
- But the Chancellor said...

612
00:44:49,104 --> 00:44:50,897
I'm SOFTY, say again?

613
00:44:51,857 --> 00:44:53,233
- Sorry.
- The Chancellor's not here

614
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:54,818
on the ground.

615
00:44:54,943 --> 00:44:57,696
Believe me, if that target's given
even half a chance, he will end us.

616
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,866
If you see him, you shoot to kill.

617
00:45:00,949 --> 00:45:02,451
- Is that understood?
- Will you lay off, asshole?

618
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:04,786
I keep telling you, that's my phone.

619
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:06,288
The guy gave it to me, I swear.

620
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:07,372
Where was he going?

621
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:09,624
Who?

622
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:11,042
The man that gave it to you.

623
00:45:11,126 --> 00:45:13,837
Lady, do I look like a psychic?
How the hell do I know?

624
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,257
All I'm saying is that phone
is my personal property now, okay?

625
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,717
I know my rights, so you all can just...

626
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:21,219
Hey!

627
00:45:25,807 --> 00:45:27,058
When you've got your breath back,

628
00:45:27,809 --> 00:45:29,144
you're going to tell me everything

629
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:30,979
that man said to you,
starting from the beginning.

630
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,731
Who are you?

631
00:45:33,982 --> 00:45:35,442
I'm his wife.

632
00:45:43,909 --> 00:45:45,619
Okay. You're good.

633
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:50,498
Can I help you, sir?

634
00:45:50,582 --> 00:45:52,876
Yeah, I have a safety-deposit box here.

635
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:55,879
It's 10549.

636
00:46:07,182 --> 00:46:08,266
Okay.

637
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:09,684
This way, please.

638
00:46:21,363 --> 00:46:24,824
Just need a signature match.

639
00:46:26,326 --> 00:46:28,203
- Signature match?
- For the account.

640
00:46:34,376 --> 00:46:36,544
Is there a problem, Mr. Reed?

641
00:46:38,046 --> 00:46:39,381
No. No problem.

642
00:46:50,517 --> 00:46:52,686
You can use any one of these client rooms.

643
00:46:52,769 --> 00:46:54,229
And I'll just be outside, if you need me.

644
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:55,522
Thanks.

645
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:23,818
Okay.

646
00:48:28,698 --> 00:48:29,824
They're gonna be
coming for me any second,

647
00:48:29,908 --> 00:48:31,576
so I need to make this quick.

648
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:34,412
Okay, you're going to
find this hard to believe,

649
00:48:36,581 --> 00:48:37,999
but this is not your face.

650
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:41,294
I've been captured and resculpted into this,

651
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:43,922
this person you think you are now.

652
00:48:44,506 --> 00:48:47,717
If you're watching this,
it means I failed to escape.

653
00:48:47,801 --> 00:48:49,844
It means, it means they
succeeded in giving you

654
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,555
a new name, a new identity

655
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:55,433
and a new set of memories...
Everything, everything.

656
00:48:55,517 --> 00:48:57,560
Anything you think
you know about your life,

657
00:48:57,811 --> 00:48:59,312
it's not real.

658
00:48:59,521 --> 00:49:01,022
You have to believe me.

659
00:49:01,106 --> 00:49:03,066
The most important thing for you to do now,

660
00:49:04,526 --> 00:49:05,819
is get to my apartment!

661
00:49:05,902 --> 00:49:07,112
Get to my apartment!

662
00:49:07,195 --> 00:49:09,489
549 Hysperion, Block D.

663
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:11,449
I want to tell you more,
but I can't trust you yet.

664
00:49:11,533 --> 00:49:13,785
My only hope is, if you are me,

665
00:49:14,202 --> 00:49:17,122
you found the key
and you know what to do with it.

666
00:49:17,205 --> 00:49:19,707
You found the key
and you know what to do with it!

667
00:49:19,916 --> 00:49:20,959
What key? What key?

668
00:49:21,042 --> 00:49:22,210
- What key?
- Good luck.

669
00:49:22,544 --> 00:49:23,920
- Good luck, buddy.
- What...

670
00:49:26,214 --> 00:49:27,757
Come on, come on.

671
00:49:28,341 --> 00:49:28,842
Come on.

672
00:49:55,827 --> 00:49:58,204
Passengers may proceed
to security screening.

673
00:49:58,288 --> 00:50:00,832
Please have
your identification documents ready.

674
00:50:04,002 --> 00:50:05,211
Hold it!

675
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:11,342
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to step
through the scanner again, please.

676
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:16,598
How long are you here?

677
00:50:16,681 --> 00:50:18,016
Two weeks.

678
00:50:20,852 --> 00:50:22,270
Are you a citizen of The Colony?

679
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:23,438
Yes.

680
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:26,774
How long is your stay?

681
00:50:26,858 --> 00:50:28,026
Three days.

682
00:50:28,193 --> 00:50:30,028
What is your business in the U.F.B.?

683
00:50:30,487 --> 00:50:31,654
Thank you.

684
00:50:32,155 --> 00:50:33,364
Excuse me?

685
00:50:33,865 --> 00:50:34,991
Three days.

686
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,743
Yes. Thank you.

687
00:50:39,412 --> 00:50:40,538
- That's him!
- What the...

688
00:50:56,679 --> 00:50:57,847
Everybody down!

689
00:51:19,744 --> 00:51:21,371
Eastside exit!

690
00:51:22,163 --> 00:51:23,706
Go, go, go!

691
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:27,043
We have a visual!

692
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:29,254
- Coming through!
- Go, go!

693
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:32,840
We've alerted all units outside.

694
00:51:32,924 --> 00:51:34,509
How the hell did he get
a weapon past the scanner?

695
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:35,969
He didn't.

696
00:51:36,261 --> 00:51:37,512
Perfect.

697
00:51:44,394 --> 00:51:46,271
Move, move, move, move!

698
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:55,280
Clear, clear! Move!

699
00:51:55,738 --> 00:51:57,448
- Alert 6246.
- Hey!

700
00:51:57,532 --> 00:51:59,284
All units, take position.

701
00:51:59,951 --> 00:52:01,452
- He's headed up to I-19.
- Copy that.

702
00:52:01,536 --> 00:52:02,787
Move it!

703
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:13,798
Oh, God! Oh, God.

704
00:52:27,854 --> 00:52:29,397
Get in! Now!

705
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:45,163
I can't believe it's you.

706
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:47,248
You recognize me?

707
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:48,833
I don't know.

708
00:52:49,459 --> 00:52:50,543
Wait.

709
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:51,878
Do you know who I am?

710
00:52:53,463 --> 00:52:55,006
I have been looking for you everywhere.

711
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:57,800
Suddenly, you show up
on all the police scanners.

712
00:52:58,051 --> 00:52:59,052
Oh, shit.

713
00:53:00,845 --> 00:53:01,929
Hold on.

714
00:53:08,019 --> 00:53:09,312
You really don't remember me?

715
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:11,356
No.

716
00:53:12,023 --> 00:53:14,859
I've seen you before, but it's...

717
00:53:15,068 --> 00:53:16,194
It's okay.

718
00:53:16,736 --> 00:53:18,821
It's okay. I can explain everything.

719
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:25,620
Central 99, air support has visual

720
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:27,914
on the suspect traveling north
on Interstate 19.

721
00:53:36,339 --> 00:53:37,590
Oh, shit.

722
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:38,841
Lori.

723
00:53:39,008 --> 00:53:40,051
Who?

724
00:53:40,301 --> 00:53:41,761
It's my wife.

725
00:53:42,428 --> 00:53:43,554
You're married?

726
00:53:43,763 --> 00:53:45,390
It's safe to say we're separated.

727
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:38,025
Here, you drive!

728
00:55:19,775 --> 00:55:21,777
Suspect is headed to suspension level three.

729
00:55:21,861 --> 00:55:24,155
Repeat, he has headed to suspension three.

730
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:52,934
AV-81,
he's headed eastbound on Wellington.

731
00:55:53,017 --> 00:55:54,727
I want you there before he is, do you copy?

732
00:55:55,436 --> 00:55:56,521
Copy that, 905.

733
00:55:56,604 --> 00:55:58,940
All vehicle and air support,
proceed to Wellington.

734
00:56:00,483 --> 00:56:03,194
Establish a barricade in zone 217.

735
00:56:15,164 --> 00:56:17,959
Central, I want all units
to maintain their perimeter.

736
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:19,752
Drive him into that barricade.

737
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:24,215
Do not allow him any room for evasion.

738
00:56:24,298 --> 00:56:25,299
Is that clear?

739
00:56:25,383 --> 00:56:26,509
Copy that, 905.

740
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:28,803
All vehicles, hold position.

741
00:56:29,262 --> 00:56:30,471
Oh, shit.

742
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:33,140
Shit.

743
00:56:33,224 --> 00:56:34,934
Warning, mag suspension cannot be

744
00:56:35,351 --> 00:56:37,061
disengaged while vehicle is in operation.

745
00:56:38,938 --> 00:56:40,022
What the hell are you doing?

746
00:56:40,106 --> 00:56:41,732
You're gonna need your seat belt on!

747
00:56:43,484 --> 00:56:46,946
Warning, mag suspension cannot be
disengaged while vehicle is in...

748
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:52,034
They've got a lock on the vehicle.

749
00:56:52,118 --> 00:56:53,494
Are they clear to engage?

750
00:56:53,578 --> 00:56:54,787
You are clear to engage.

751
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:56,330
- Got it?
- No,no!

752
00:56:56,414 --> 00:56:57,540
- You got it?
- Yes!

753
00:57:05,089 --> 00:57:06,132
Shit!

754
00:57:15,516 --> 00:57:17,685
Welcome. Operating systems activated.

755
00:58:22,667 --> 00:58:26,087
Welcome home Mr. Reed.
Did you have a nice day?

756
00:58:26,212 --> 00:58:27,713
Great, thanks.

757
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:45,119
The key, the key, the key.

758
01:02:22,865 --> 01:02:24,408
This message is being recorded

759
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:27,077
in the event of a worst-case scenario.

760
01:02:27,578 --> 01:02:30,539
I'm sure you're desperate for answers,
so I 'll just start from the top.

761
01:02:32,166 --> 01:02:33,417
My name...

762
01:02:34,918 --> 01:02:40,424
Your name is Carl Hauser.

763
01:02:41,842 --> 01:02:43,093
Oh, shit.

764
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,972
This recording has limited
interactive capabilities.

765
01:02:47,056 --> 01:02:48,807
So, just try rephrasing the question.

766
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:51,226
You work with Matthias.

767
01:02:52,019 --> 01:02:53,062
Yes and no.

768
01:02:53,187 --> 01:02:56,148
I've never actually met the man.

769
01:02:56,231 --> 01:02:57,900
Hardly anyone has.

770
01:02:58,359 --> 01:03:01,028
Look, I know that this is complicated.

771
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:02,863
- Complicated?
- But this is the truth.

772
01:03:03,489 --> 01:03:06,450
I am a Federal Intelligence operative

773
01:03:06,742 --> 01:03:08,369
assigned by Cohaagen

774
01:03:08,702 --> 01:03:12,456
to infiltrate the Resistance
and assassinate Matthias.

775
01:03:13,374 --> 01:03:14,625
But instead,

776
01:03:17,044 --> 01:03:19,380
I discovered
I was fighting for the wrong side.

777
01:03:20,714 --> 01:03:22,674
<i>I met</i> a <i>woman</i>

778
01:03:22,758 --> 01:03:24,301
She works with the Resistance.

779
01:03:24,385 --> 01:03:26,428
And she showed me
that they were worth fighting for.

780
01:03:27,429 --> 01:03:28,597
You mean the terrorists.

781
01:03:29,181 --> 01:03:32,810
Listen, the Resistance are not terrorists.

782
01:03:33,227 --> 01:03:34,228
All right.

783
01:03:34,353 --> 01:03:37,231
Matthias' targets are always
military installations.

784
01:03:37,356 --> 01:03:38,565
If there's anything else happening,

785
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:40,943
you can be sure it's Cohaagen himself.

786
01:03:41,068 --> 01:03:42,778
Trust me, all right.

787
01:03:42,861 --> 01:03:45,406
The Chancellor and I go way back.

788
01:03:45,572 --> 01:03:47,950
He was my commanding officer in the war.

789
01:03:48,075 --> 01:03:50,411
I know exactly what he is capable of.

790
01:03:50,619 --> 01:03:52,913
Why would he attack his own people?
I don't understand.

791
01:03:52,996 --> 01:03:58,377
How else could he justify tripling
production of federal police synthetics?

792
01:03:59,086 --> 01:04:03,173
He is building a private army
capable of invading The Colony.

793
01:04:03,924 --> 01:04:04,925
Think about it. All right.

794
01:04:05,008 --> 01:04:08,887
What is the one resource The Colony has
that United Britain doesn't?

795
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:11,723
- S pace.
- Exactly.

796
01:04:12,391 --> 01:04:13,475
He's run out of room.

797
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:16,228
But even Cohaagen himself
is gonna have a difficult time

798
01:04:16,311 --> 01:04:20,107
selling the forced seizure
and mass displacement of billions.

799
01:04:20,315 --> 01:04:23,110
So, he created an enemy in Matthias,

800
01:04:23,527 --> 01:04:25,446
and he built an army to fight him.

801
01:04:26,071 --> 01:04:28,157
And now it is up to me to stop him.

802
01:04:28,282 --> 01:04:29,575
Up to you to stop him.

803
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:30,784
What do you mean, me?

804
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:35,914
The synthetics run on a bio-mech brainstem.

805
01:04:36,665 --> 01:04:39,877
All right. Which means, it's possible
to shut 'em all down.

806
01:04:40,627 --> 01:04:42,546
All right, there's a kill code.

807
01:04:42,629 --> 01:04:44,131
It's a complex sequence,

808
01:04:44,298 --> 01:04:46,467
but it's in my head, it's in your head.

809
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:49,052
Sorry, come again.

810
01:04:49,136 --> 01:04:51,889
I went back to U. F.B. territory

811
01:04:52,306 --> 01:04:53,974
to try and retrieve the code,

812
01:04:54,641 --> 01:04:57,895
knowing full well that if Cohaagen
found out I'd turned,

813
01:04:58,520 --> 01:04:59,730
he'd erase my memory.

814
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:04,151
But what he didn't know was that
I arranged to have a black box

815
01:05:04,276 --> 01:05:06,528
imbedded in my brain, in your brain.

816
01:05:07,029 --> 01:05:08,906
It recorded everything I saw.

817
01:05:08,989 --> 01:05:11,366
So, you're saying
there's a little safe in my skull.

818
01:05:12,034 --> 01:05:13,327
Yes.

819
01:05:13,494 --> 01:05:15,078
And that is why I need you.

820
01:05:15,329 --> 01:05:19,124
The world needs you,
to reconnect with the Resistance.

821
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:21,460
Deliver the code to Matthias,

822
01:05:21,543 --> 01:05:26,131
have him shut down the synthetics
and stop Cohaagen while there's still time.

823
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:31,011
The future hangs on what you...

824
01:05:31,929 --> 01:05:33,180
On what we do next.

825
01:05:35,182 --> 01:05:36,600
Good luck, buddy.

826
01:05:41,021 --> 01:05:43,232
You have got to be kidding me.

827
01:05:43,565 --> 01:05:45,192
This can't be happening.

828
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:46,777
Shouldn't have come here.

829
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:52,699
Yeah, I know.

830
01:05:53,659 --> 01:05:55,244
I had no choice.

831
01:05:56,078 --> 01:05:57,621
I know that this is a lot to take.

832
01:05:58,705 --> 01:06:00,707
Yeah, it's a lot to take.

833
01:06:02,042 --> 01:06:03,210
Yeah, I'm supposed to believe this?

834
01:06:04,211 --> 01:06:05,587
It's the truth.

835
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:08,298
Hauser, we have been looking for you.

836
01:06:08,549 --> 01:06:09,591
Don't call me...

837
01:06:09,675 --> 01:06:12,302
My name is Doug Quaid.
I was born August 29th.

838
01:06:12,386 --> 01:06:13,637
All right, I was raised by my mother.

839
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,764
She died of cancer ten days
before my 15th birthday.

840
01:06:15,847 --> 01:06:16,807
I married my girlfriend when I was 29!

841
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:18,725
You were born April 29th.

842
01:06:18,809 --> 01:06:20,561
You were raised by your father,
not your mother.

843
01:06:20,644 --> 01:06:23,480
He died before you were 15,
but in a car crash.

844
01:06:23,564 --> 01:06:26,733
And believe me, you were
most definitely not married.

845
01:06:27,776 --> 01:06:30,612
I'm sorry. You know what?
None of this makes any sense to me.

846
01:06:30,696 --> 01:06:31,738
I'm Doug Quaid, that's all I know.

847
01:06:32,406 --> 01:06:33,615
You recognized me.

848
01:06:33,699 --> 01:06:35,158
From a dream.

849
01:06:35,784 --> 01:06:38,203
I recognize you from a dream.

850
01:06:39,204 --> 01:06:40,581
It wasn't a dream.

851
01:06:41,999 --> 01:06:43,584
It was a memory.

852
01:06:46,753 --> 01:06:48,922
That scar on your hand,
how do you think you got it?

853
01:06:50,757 --> 01:06:51,800
Do you know?

854
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:55,262
I got it at work.

855
01:07:10,110 --> 01:07:13,322
I was trying to help you escape,
but I was too late.

856
01:07:13,405 --> 01:07:14,656
You grabbed onto me

857
01:07:14,740 --> 01:07:17,701
and a bullet tore through
your hand and mine.

858
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:32,966
You must remember something.

859
01:07:40,891 --> 01:07:43,685
And you and I, we were...

860
01:07:46,229 --> 01:07:47,230
Yeah.

861
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:51,485
We got to go. We got to go.

862
01:08:11,088 --> 01:08:12,172
Shit. Come on, come on.

863
01:08:14,424 --> 01:08:15,759
Doug!

864
01:08:18,512 --> 01:08:19,554
Harry?

865
01:08:24,518 --> 01:08:25,602
Harry, what are you doing here?

866
01:08:26,561 --> 01:08:28,522
They sent me in for you.

867
01:08:29,022 --> 01:08:30,190
To talk you down.

868
01:08:30,273 --> 01:08:31,316
Who sent you in?

869
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:32,609
Doug,

870
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:36,697
you don't get it.
I don't mean they sent me in here.

871
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:39,366
I mean, they sent me into your mind.

872
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:41,326
I need you to listen to me.

873
01:08:41,410 --> 01:08:44,454
You're suffering what's called
a paranoid dissociative break.

874
01:08:44,663 --> 01:08:46,915
Brought on by the trauma
of a chemical fantasy.

875
01:08:47,916 --> 01:08:48,959
What are you talking about?

876
01:08:49,042 --> 01:08:51,211
You're not really here, Doug.

877
01:08:51,712 --> 01:08:54,089
You're still back at Rekall,
strapped to a chair.

878
01:08:54,423 --> 01:08:55,674
None of this is real.

879
01:08:55,757 --> 01:08:56,883
Back at Rekall?

880
01:08:58,051 --> 01:08:59,094
He's lying.

881
01:08:59,177 --> 01:09:00,178
He's lying!

882
01:09:02,055 --> 01:09:03,140
Just slow down.

883
01:09:03,223 --> 01:09:04,224
Harry, what are you talking about?

884
01:09:04,474 --> 01:09:07,102
When we were back at the bar,
you had me worried. So, I followed you.

885
01:09:08,061 --> 01:09:09,980
And by the time I got here, it was too late.

886
01:09:10,856 --> 01:09:11,857
You were unresponsive.

887
01:09:13,275 --> 01:09:16,194
So they chemically
transfused me into your mind.

888
01:09:17,154 --> 01:09:20,073
They thought a familiar face might
help, to try and bring you back

889
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:21,908
before it's too late

890
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:23,577
and you're trapped here forever.

891
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:26,413
Do not listen to them. They're just trying
to recover what's in your head.

892
01:09:28,081 --> 01:09:30,375
Doug, I assure you.

893
01:09:30,459 --> 01:09:32,002
This is not the Harry that you know.

894
01:09:32,961 --> 01:09:33,962
Think...

895
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:36,673
Does he even sound like himself?

896
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:40,385
He is a plant, just like your wife,
to keep you in line.

897
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:44,389
I don't sound like me, Doug,
because you don't want me to.

898
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:47,142
What do you mean, "I don't want you to"?

899
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:49,603
You need to realize,
I'm merely the idea of Harry.

900
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:51,813
The rest is supplied
by your own imagination.

901
01:09:52,522 --> 01:09:54,357
Even the explanation
I'm giving you right now.

902
01:09:55,275 --> 01:09:57,652
It's really you. It's really you.

903
01:09:58,695 --> 01:10:00,489
Your mind is choosing the words.

904
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:04,701
Because that's where we are, Doug.
In your mind.

905
01:10:06,745 --> 01:10:10,999
We must get you out before it's too late,
and you're trapped here forever.

906
01:10:13,627 --> 01:10:14,836
If this is all in my mind,

907
01:10:16,755 --> 01:10:17,756
why are you wearing a bulletproof vest?

908
01:10:18,507 --> 01:10:19,966
Because you put it on me.

909
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:21,259
- I put it on you?
- Don't you see?

910
01:10:21,343 --> 01:10:22,761
Explain that to me, how do I put this on you?

911
01:10:22,844 --> 01:10:23,929
He's crazy.

912
01:10:24,137 --> 01:10:25,806
Part of you wants to protect me.

913
01:10:26,097 --> 01:10:28,183
To let me guide you back to consciousness

914
01:10:28,809 --> 01:10:31,853
before your psychosis
reaches such extreme levels

915
01:10:32,395 --> 01:10:34,105
that you slip into a permanent coma.

916
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:38,026
To convince you to free yourself.

917
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:39,569
Hauser...

918
01:10:40,821 --> 01:10:42,989
I am real. He is real.

919
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:44,825
He works for Cohaagen.

920
01:10:47,494 --> 01:10:48,620
Lori?

921
01:10:53,291 --> 01:10:56,253
- What's she doing here?
- She's here, too, Doug.

922
01:10:56,336 --> 01:10:57,420
What's she doing here?

923
01:10:57,504 --> 01:11:00,257
She's in the room, beside you,

924
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:01,758
holding your hand right now,

925
01:11:01,842 --> 01:11:03,009
worried sick.

926
01:11:03,218 --> 01:11:04,803
It's her presence you're sensing.

927
01:11:04,886 --> 01:11:06,972
She's... She's trying to kill me!

928
01:11:07,055 --> 01:11:08,098
- No.
- Harry!

929
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:09,432
Not the real Lori, Doug.

930
01:11:09,724 --> 01:11:12,853
As soon as I told her what was happening at
Rekall, she came straight over.

931
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:15,063
I had to call her at work.

932
01:11:15,146 --> 01:11:16,189
She loves you, Doug.

933
01:11:19,109 --> 01:11:22,153
Lori didn't work last night, Harry.

934
01:11:24,489 --> 01:11:26,825
You're lying. You're lying.

935
01:11:26,908 --> 01:11:28,118
Why are you lying to me?

936
01:11:28,201 --> 01:11:29,870
Only because you wanted me to.

937
01:11:31,663 --> 01:11:33,623
You're clinging to the delusion.

938
01:11:33,874 --> 01:11:34,875
He's lying!

939
01:11:38,336 --> 01:11:39,462
Harry?

940
01:11:39,546 --> 01:11:40,714
Harry.

941
01:11:41,381 --> 01:11:43,717
I swear to God, put it down.

942
01:11:44,259 --> 01:11:46,344
Harry, what are you doing?

943
01:11:46,678 --> 01:11:47,804
Harry, what are you doing?

944
01:11:47,888 --> 01:11:49,222
This is not a delusion!

945
01:11:51,349 --> 01:11:52,350
No?

946
01:11:53,226 --> 01:11:55,228
Okay, fine.

947
01:11:55,353 --> 01:11:56,521
Tell you what.

948
01:12:10,911 --> 01:12:12,787
Is that proof enough for you?

949
01:12:13,163 --> 01:12:15,165
Would I have done that if this were for real?

950
01:12:16,917 --> 01:12:18,835
You see, I'm not afraid, Doug.

951
01:12:20,086 --> 01:12:21,212
You shouldn't be either.

952
01:12:23,465 --> 01:12:26,676
That's enough of this bullshit.
Now, you are gonna tell him the truth,

953
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:28,762
or I swear to God I'm gonna kill you.

954
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:31,598
Don't... Don't.

955
01:12:32,599 --> 01:12:33,600
Hauser...

956
01:12:34,267 --> 01:12:37,520
He's trying to manipulate you
into giving yourself up!

957
01:12:38,104 --> 01:12:40,732
- We got to get out of here.
- And go where?

958
01:12:42,317 --> 01:12:43,860
There's no getting
out of your own head, Doug.

959
01:12:43,944 --> 01:12:47,405
But you can escape this nightmare
if you let me help you.

960
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:49,324
Help me how?

961
01:12:49,574 --> 01:12:51,284
- Don't listen to him.
- How can you help me?

962
01:12:51,409 --> 01:12:52,452
Don't listen to him.

963
01:12:54,496 --> 01:12:56,122
You have to shoot her, Doug.

964
01:12:57,958 --> 01:12:59,084
What, now?

965
01:12:59,459 --> 01:13:00,794
I know that's asking a lot,

966
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:05,465
but she's at the epicenter of this whole

967
01:13:05,548 --> 01:13:06,758
twisted fantasy of yours.

968
01:13:07,968 --> 01:13:11,805
She represents all your frustration,
all your unhappiness.

969
01:13:12,138 --> 01:13:13,264
- Hauser...
- Which is why

970
01:13:13,348 --> 01:13:14,849
it would mean nothing if we were to kill her.

971
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,727
It's you who has to choose reality.

972
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:20,397
You shoot her, Doug, and I promise you,

973
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:23,942
you will gasp awake
and find me sitting in the room beside you.

974
01:13:24,025 --> 01:13:25,026
The real me.

975
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:27,278
- No.
- Your old pal, Harry.

976
01:13:27,362 --> 01:13:28,363
Look at me.

977
01:13:29,114 --> 01:13:31,658
Turn, and you'll see your beautiful,

978
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:33,034
loving wife.

979
01:13:33,994 --> 01:13:35,161
She wants you back, Doug.

980
01:13:36,121 --> 01:13:37,664
We both do.

981
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:39,833
That's right, Doug.

982
01:13:40,291 --> 01:13:41,835
Come on back.

983
01:13:45,380 --> 01:13:46,798
Come on back, Doug.

984
01:13:51,344 --> 01:13:53,638
I can't let them take you away.

985
01:13:53,972 --> 01:13:56,141
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

986
01:14:09,029 --> 01:14:10,071
Of course she can't do it.

987
01:14:10,155 --> 01:14:11,281
She's not real.

988
01:14:12,907 --> 01:14:15,368
Now you just need to prove it to yourself.

989
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:16,661
End her, Doug.

990
01:14:17,537 --> 01:14:19,039
End this nightmare.

991
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,125
Shoot her!

992
01:14:22,333 --> 01:14:24,002
Kill her, damn it!

993
01:14:27,047 --> 01:14:28,048
Shoot!

994
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:56,576
Jesus Christ.

995
01:14:57,535 --> 01:14:58,661
God damn it, Harry!

996
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:04,292
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

997
01:15:05,210 --> 01:15:06,836
Come on.

998
01:15:19,265 --> 01:15:21,267
You still out there, baby?

999
01:15:26,064 --> 01:15:28,233
Or I suppose I should be calling you Hauser.

1000
01:15:28,650 --> 01:15:30,610
I guess the joke's on me.

1001
01:15:31,277 --> 01:15:33,029
I really thought you were a loser.

1002
01:15:34,447 --> 01:15:38,201
Turns out, I was living with
the greatest intelligence agent alive.

1003
01:15:39,953 --> 01:15:42,872
Cohaagen still wants you back, you know.

1004
01:15:42,956 --> 01:15:44,791
Guess he still has faith in you.

1005
01:15:46,626 --> 01:15:49,129
But then you always were the favorite.

1006
01:15:51,381 --> 01:15:53,007
But I know what you are.

1007
01:15:53,091 --> 01:15:54,592
You're a traitor, Hauser.

1008
01:15:55,552 --> 01:15:56,636
And traitors get put to death!

1009
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:58,763
Come on, come on, come on.

1010
01:16:02,559 --> 01:16:05,854
So you might want to give
your little girlfriend a kiss good-bye.

1011
01:16:07,230 --> 01:16:09,482
Long as she doesn't mind
where those lips have been.

1012
01:16:19,409 --> 01:16:21,202
Oh, that's it, I'm ending this bitch.

1013
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:26,833
Shit, I'm out.

1014
01:16:35,258 --> 01:16:36,843
Come on! Come on!

1015
01:16:36,926 --> 01:16:38,094
Go!

1016
01:16:45,101 --> 01:16:46,144
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1017
01:16:46,227 --> 01:16:47,478
Come on.

1018
01:16:54,569 --> 01:16:55,570
Shit.

1019
01:16:55,653 --> 01:16:56,946
Go!

1020
01:17:15,465 --> 01:17:16,507
There.

1021
01:17:16,591 --> 01:17:17,592
Oh, shit.

1022
01:17:22,847 --> 01:17:24,265
Come on.

1023
01:17:30,063 --> 01:17:31,189
Give me the gun.

1024
01:17:42,241 --> 01:17:43,284
Track him.

1025
01:17:48,331 --> 01:17:49,540
Grab my arm!

1026
01:18:19,779 --> 01:18:21,114
Is this going down?

1027
01:18:23,157 --> 01:18:24,242
No?

1028
01:18:24,409 --> 01:18:26,244
Level D-14.

1029
01:19:56,167 --> 01:19:57,376
Shit.

1030
01:20:09,722 --> 01:20:10,973
Come on. Come on.

1031
01:20:11,974 --> 01:20:13,392
Wait, wait.

1032
01:20:13,476 --> 01:20:14,560
Go!

1033
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:51,347
You really know how to pick 'em.

1034
01:20:57,353 --> 01:20:58,604
Come on.

1035
01:21:15,997 --> 01:21:19,166
Sources close to the Chancellor
will neither confirm nor deny...

1036
01:21:20,334 --> 01:21:23,921
Passage on The Fall requires
a current transit visa.

1037
01:21:24,005 --> 01:21:28,467
If you do not have a current transit visa,
please visit the information office.

1038
01:21:37,852 --> 01:21:41,731
The largest real estate agency
has now opened. Be sure to visit...

1039
01:21:41,814 --> 01:21:45,526
The Resistance leader has been
in hiding for over six months.

1040
01:21:45,610 --> 01:21:47,528
In the wake of these latest attacks,

1041
01:21:47,612 --> 01:21:50,448
federal police have
uncovered alarming new evidence

1042
01:21:50,531 --> 01:21:53,284
proving what many
in the Cohaagen administration have

1043
01:21:53,367 --> 01:21:56,495
long suspected, that Matthias
and his terrorist movement

1044
01:21:56,579 --> 01:22:01,000
are being funded by The Colony's governor
and his district's organization.

1045
01:22:01,083 --> 01:22:04,962
And we're now hearing unconfirmed reports
of military mobilization.

1046
01:22:05,046 --> 01:22:06,922
Sources close to the Chancellor will neither

1047
01:22:07,006 --> 01:22:08,591
-confirm nor deny the reports.
- Jesus.

1048
01:22:08,674 --> 01:22:10,301
The Resistance leader has been...

1049
01:22:10,384 --> 01:22:11,969
We've got to get you to Matthias.

1050
01:22:12,053 --> 01:22:13,679
How the hell do we find him?

1051
01:22:13,763 --> 01:22:15,389
There's a way. Come on.

1052
01:22:53,052 --> 01:22:54,053
Who is he?

1053
01:23:01,852 --> 01:23:02,853
It's Hauser.

1054
01:23:11,696 --> 01:23:12,863
Unbelievable.

1055
01:23:20,287 --> 01:23:21,414
Welcome home.

1056
01:23:21,914 --> 01:23:22,998
Yeah.

1057
01:23:26,627 --> 01:23:28,504
- We'll let your father know you're here.
- Thank you.

1058
01:23:38,097 --> 01:23:39,598
So, Matthias is your father?

1059
01:23:41,726 --> 01:23:43,769
Of course you don't remember that.
Yes, he is.

1060
01:23:46,439 --> 01:23:47,440
That's good to know.

1061
01:23:57,116 --> 01:23:58,325
Airlock sealed.

1062
01:24:03,581 --> 01:24:05,040
Cohaagen scours U.F.B.

1063
01:24:05,124 --> 01:24:07,126
and The Colony every day
looking for my father.

1064
01:24:09,295 --> 01:24:11,130
The reason they can't
find him is he's not there.

1065
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:14,925
After the wars,

1066
01:24:15,009 --> 01:24:17,303
no one would be crazy
enough to come out here.

1067
01:24:17,803 --> 01:24:19,221
Everyone stays out of the No Zone.

1068
01:24:20,473 --> 01:24:21,849
Makes sense.

1069
01:24:40,326 --> 01:24:42,578
-Hey.
-Hey.

1070
01:24:42,661 --> 01:24:43,746
Almost there.

1071
01:24:48,626 --> 01:24:50,336
You Okay?

1072
01:24:52,546 --> 01:24:54,006
Yeah, I'm...

1073
01:24:56,675 --> 01:25:00,095
Everyone seems to know me, but me.

1074
01:25:01,597 --> 01:25:02,973
It's strange.

1075
01:25:04,725 --> 01:25:05,851
Yeah.

1076
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:09,396
I can see he meant a lot to these guys.

1077
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:12,483
Yeah.

1078
01:25:13,234 --> 01:25:14,693
He gave us the upper hand.

1079
01:25:16,403 --> 01:25:20,032
And some of us were really
able to see the best in him.

1080
01:25:20,866 --> 01:25:22,618
What if the best is gone?

1081
01:25:26,539 --> 01:25:28,082
I'm sorry.

1082
01:25:30,209 --> 01:25:32,002
Hauser wasn't perfect, you know.

1083
01:25:32,086 --> 01:25:34,713
Could be a real asshole sometimes.

1084
01:25:37,216 --> 01:25:39,093
You're just trying to make me feel better.

1085
01:25:40,344 --> 01:25:41,512
Maybe.

1086
01:25:42,805 --> 01:25:44,265
It's working.

1087
01:26:43,782 --> 01:26:44,950
Clear.

1088
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:03,802
He wants to see him alone.

1089
01:27:14,271 --> 01:27:15,314
Don't go too far.

1090
01:27:16,523 --> 01:27:17,650
Okay.

1091
01:27:40,839 --> 01:27:42,007
Mr. Hauser.

1092
01:27:48,097 --> 01:27:49,556
What is it you want?

1093
01:27:51,183 --> 01:27:52,685
I want to help you.

1094
01:27:55,646 --> 01:27:58,315
That is not the only reason you're here.

1095
01:28:03,737 --> 01:28:04,863
I want to remember.

1096
01:28:06,407 --> 01:28:07,616
Why?

1097
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:10,703
So I can be myself, be who I was.

1098
01:28:12,037 --> 01:28:16,041
It is each man's quest
to find out who he truly is,

1099
01:28:16,125 --> 01:28:18,627
but the answer to that lies

1100
01:28:18,711 --> 01:28:21,130
in the present, not in the past.

1101
01:28:21,213 --> 01:28:22,715
As it is for all of us.

1102
01:28:22,798 --> 01:28:25,467
But the past tells us who we've become.

1103
01:28:25,551 --> 01:28:28,804
The past is a construct of the mind.

1104
01:28:29,888 --> 01:28:31,306
It blinds us.

1105
01:28:31,390 --> 01:28:33,600
It fools us into believing it.

1106
01:28:34,059 --> 01:28:35,144
But the heart

1107
01:28:35,227 --> 01:28:38,063
wants to live in the present.

1108
01:28:39,231 --> 01:28:40,566
Look there.

1109
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:43,402
You'll find your answer.

1110
01:28:48,615 --> 01:28:52,077
I am told you have information
that may save us all.

1111
01:28:53,829 --> 01:28:55,581
I am told the same.

1112
01:29:26,278 --> 01:29:29,656
The firewall to the black box.

1113
01:29:30,491 --> 01:29:31,784
We're in.

1114
01:29:43,462 --> 01:29:44,546
There.

1115
01:29:44,630 --> 01:29:45,798
You see?

1116
01:29:45,881 --> 01:29:47,049
Jesus.

1117
01:29:48,467 --> 01:29:50,219
Can you retrieve it?

1118
01:29:51,303 --> 01:29:52,930
It's encrypted.

1119
01:29:58,268 --> 01:29:59,478
What is this?

1120
01:30:12,324 --> 01:30:13,450
Hello, Matthias.

1121
01:30:14,201 --> 01:30:15,661
You can't imagine how much

1122
01:30:15,744 --> 01:30:17,663
<i>I've been looking forward
to seeing you again.</i>

1123
01:30:18,539 --> 01:30:20,499
It's been far too long.

1124
01:30:20,582 --> 01:30:23,377
You know, you're a very hard man to find.

1125
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:25,671
- It's a trap.
- Shut it all down!

1126
01:30:27,673 --> 01:30:29,258
Secure all entrances!

1127
01:30:30,801 --> 01:30:31,844
Move! Move!

1128
01:30:37,015 --> 01:30:38,058
Go, go, go!

1129
01:31:00,205 --> 01:31:01,707
Get him out of here!

1130
01:31:06,879 --> 01:31:08,213
Gun down now!

1131
01:31:10,549 --> 01:31:11,967
Now!

1132
01:31:38,869 --> 01:31:40,078
Well done.

1133
01:31:42,915 --> 01:31:44,082
It's impressive.

1134
01:31:46,418 --> 01:31:48,754
You'll be interested to know that

1135
01:31:49,254 --> 01:31:50,797
there is no kill code.

1136
01:31:52,758 --> 01:31:53,759
It was a fake.

1137
01:31:53,842 --> 01:31:55,093
You're lying.

1138
01:31:56,678 --> 01:31:57,763
Sorry.

1139
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:00,682
It was the only way to get to you.

1140
01:32:00,766 --> 01:32:03,018
All this trouble for one man.

1141
01:32:03,936 --> 01:32:06,438
Oh, never underestimate
the power of one man.

1142
01:32:07,397 --> 01:32:08,440
I know I don't.

1143
01:32:11,693 --> 01:32:12,736
Father!

1144
01:32:13,987 --> 01:32:15,447
No! No!

1145
01:32:19,993 --> 01:32:21,703
We knew this day would come.

1146
01:32:23,914 --> 01:32:24,915
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1147
01:32:37,844 --> 01:32:38,845
No. Melina!

1148
01:32:43,225 --> 01:32:45,060
- Lieutenant?
- It's all here, sir.

1149
01:32:45,519 --> 01:32:46,728
Matthias' defensive plans,

1150
01:32:46,812 --> 01:32:49,273
troop numbers and location coordinates

1151
01:32:49,356 --> 01:32:52,109
on every Resistance outpost in The Colony.

1152
01:32:52,192 --> 01:32:54,820
The first wave of attack is already underway.

1153
01:32:58,407 --> 01:32:59,741
Brilliant.

1154
01:33:00,575 --> 01:33:02,911
Congratulations, my friend.
Get him up, please.

1155
01:33:03,870 --> 01:33:05,163
Up, up, Up.

1156
01:33:06,331 --> 01:33:07,332
YOU did it.

1157
01:33:11,420 --> 01:33:12,587
You're a hero.

1158
01:33:16,174 --> 01:33:18,093
What is that? Modesty? No, no, no.

1159
01:33:18,218 --> 01:33:19,553
Matthias is dead,

1160
01:33:19,636 --> 01:33:21,763
The Colony is about to fall,

1161
01:33:21,847 --> 01:33:23,348
and it's all thanks to you.

1162
01:33:23,515 --> 01:33:26,643
I knew that I could trust you
to stick to the plan.

1163
01:33:27,019 --> 01:33:28,353
What are you talking about?

1164
01:33:29,604 --> 01:33:32,649
Right. Yours is not
the most reliable of memories, is it?

1165
01:33:33,525 --> 01:33:36,028
It was really rather simple.

1166
01:33:37,195 --> 01:33:41,116
Infiltrate the resistance,
find Matthias' daughter.

1167
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:43,493
- No. No.
- Get her to trust you. Yes.

1168
01:33:46,663 --> 01:33:47,664
That's right.

1169
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:50,876
Once we discovered he was your father,

1170
01:33:51,752 --> 01:33:53,712
we knew exactly who to target.

1171
01:33:53,879 --> 01:33:55,255
Melina, he's lying.

1172
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:58,425
I'm afraid not.
You see, that was also the easy part.

1173
01:33:58,717 --> 01:34:02,596
Because seduction has always been
his strongest suit.

1174
01:34:03,764 --> 01:34:07,476
Still, it was Matthias that we needed to get to.

1175
01:34:09,061 --> 01:34:11,646
He would need assurance
far beyond mere words

1176
01:34:12,439 --> 01:34:16,568
to let a man with your history, shall I say,

1177
01:34:17,027 --> 01:34:18,403
come anywhere near him.

1178
01:34:20,906 --> 01:34:25,535
But that is when you came up
with the ingenious idea

1179
01:34:25,744 --> 01:34:30,248
to feign capture
and let us wipe your slate clean.

1180
01:34:30,415 --> 01:34:31,458
Don't listen to him.

1181
01:34:34,086 --> 01:34:36,880
It was just brilliant.

1182
01:34:38,590 --> 01:34:41,218
What better way

1183
01:34:41,385 --> 01:34:43,553
to convince the old man that you

1184
01:34:44,388 --> 01:34:48,058
had really and truly turned against me.

1185
01:34:48,141 --> 01:34:50,519
Melina, don't listen to him.
Don't listen to him.

1186
01:34:50,644 --> 01:34:54,481
- He's lying.
- No, I'm not.

1187
01:34:56,691 --> 01:34:57,943
Granted, there were a few hiccups

1188
01:34:58,068 --> 01:35:00,362
along the way... You popping

1189
01:35:00,445 --> 01:35:02,739
your cap at Rekall, for instance.

1190
01:35:02,823 --> 01:35:04,533
That wasn't good.

1191
01:35:06,451 --> 01:35:07,452
There it is!

1192
01:35:09,121 --> 01:35:11,289
The old Hauser spirit.
You're gonna need that.

1193
01:35:13,291 --> 01:35:14,960
And then there was your lovely wife,

1194
01:35:15,961 --> 01:35:17,796
who strayed from her directive.

1195
01:35:17,879 --> 01:35:19,131
Look at me.

1196
01:35:19,214 --> 01:35:21,466
She was ordered to bring you back alive.

1197
01:35:24,344 --> 01:35:25,846
I'll deal with that later.

1198
01:35:29,141 --> 01:35:30,976
But,

1199
01:35:31,309 --> 01:35:33,311
you led us here, Hauser.

1200
01:35:34,062 --> 01:35:35,730
You held up your part of the deal,

1201
01:35:35,814 --> 01:35:37,232
and now I'm going to hold up mine.

1202
01:35:38,483 --> 01:35:39,818
What do you mean?

1203
01:35:45,031 --> 01:35:46,575
- No.
- What are you doing?

1204
01:35:46,658 --> 01:35:48,660
What are you...

1205
01:35:51,746 --> 01:35:53,039
What are you doing?

1206
01:35:54,916 --> 01:35:56,710
What you and I had been planning all along.

1207
01:35:58,670 --> 01:36:00,755
We made sure to back up Hauser's memory

1208
01:36:00,839 --> 01:36:02,591
before we sent him in there.

1209
01:36:07,721 --> 01:36:09,055
This is what you wanted.

1210
01:36:09,181 --> 01:36:10,515
- No.
- Yes.

1211
01:36:11,641 --> 01:36:13,560
Just think of it. In a few hours,

1212
01:36:13,643 --> 01:36:15,729
you'll awake,

1213
01:36:15,812 --> 01:36:18,482
and you will be the old Hauser once again.

1214
01:36:18,565 --> 01:36:19,816
Loyal

1215
01:36:20,692 --> 01:36:22,194
Patriotic.

1216
01:36:23,236 --> 01:36:24,529
Ruthless.

1217
01:36:27,532 --> 01:36:29,034
Now, what to do with you?

1218
01:36:30,243 --> 01:36:32,120
I think we keep her.

1219
01:36:32,204 --> 01:36:34,581
Leave her out of this.
I'm in the fucking chair!

1220
01:36:34,748 --> 01:36:36,583
I think the world will be very interested

1221
01:36:36,666 --> 01:36:37,959
to hear the confession

1222
01:36:38,043 --> 01:36:40,253
of Matthias' daughter.

1223
01:36:40,420 --> 01:36:42,714
Denouncing her father and the Resistance.

1224
01:36:45,342 --> 01:36:46,551
FUCK you!

1225
01:36:50,555 --> 01:36:51,598
Cohaagen!

1226
01:36:54,142 --> 01:36:57,896
You'll be very surprised
to see how good Hauser is at beating

1227
01:36:57,979 --> 01:36:59,231
a confession out of someone.

1228
01:36:59,314 --> 01:37:00,565
God damn you, Cohaagen.

1229
01:37:01,024 --> 01:37:02,400
You have me.

1230
01:37:03,068 --> 01:37:04,069
Let her go.

1231
01:37:04,611 --> 01:37:05,654
Let her go!

1232
01:37:11,076 --> 01:37:12,285
Melina.

1233
01:37:15,372 --> 01:37:18,083
Just try to relax.
It'll all be over soon, I promise you.

1234
01:37:18,166 --> 01:37:20,001
We'll be reunited very soon.

1235
01:37:21,253 --> 01:37:23,004
And meanwhile,

1236
01:37:23,964 --> 01:37:26,007
I have an invasion to lead.

1237
01:37:30,762 --> 01:37:32,347
I wish I could forget that easily.

1238
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:34,683
Lori.

1239
01:37:36,434 --> 01:37:37,769
Sweet dreams.

1240
01:38:00,333 --> 01:38:02,669
Hold him still, Hammond.

1241
01:38:17,142 --> 01:38:18,768
Do me a favor, asshole.

1242
01:38:19,144 --> 01:38:20,604
Fight it as much as possible.

1243
01:38:21,563 --> 01:38:23,023
Hurts more that way.

1244
01:39:01,686 --> 01:39:03,355
Jesus, Hammond.

1245
01:39:04,272 --> 01:39:06,691
Suspected reports of military mobilization

1246
01:39:06,775 --> 01:39:09,361
in the U.F.B. have now been confirmed.

1247
01:39:09,444 --> 01:39:10,945
But what was thought to be an operation

1248
01:39:11,029 --> 01:39:12,989
to uproot terrorist leader Matthias

1249
01:39:13,073 --> 01:39:16,826
appears to be on the scale
of a full military invasion.

1250
01:39:16,910 --> 01:39:18,828
An estimated 50,000 armed troops

1251
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:23,333
can be seen boarding The Fall,
preparing to deploy for The Colony.

1252
01:39:23,416 --> 01:39:26,169
The governor has issued a level-three alert

1253
01:39:26,252 --> 01:39:28,338
to all districts of The Colony.

1254
01:39:54,614 --> 01:39:56,074
Have the latest mission profiles

1255
01:39:56,157 --> 01:39:58,159
been programmed into all our troops?

1256
01:39:58,243 --> 01:40:00,495
Being distributed to
all squadron commanders as we speak.

1257
01:40:00,578 --> 01:40:01,830
Excellent. When do we depart?

1258
01:40:01,913 --> 01:40:03,498
As soon as you give the order, sir.

1259
01:40:04,165 --> 01:40:05,250
You have it.

1260
01:40:05,333 --> 01:40:07,627
And find someplace for her, will you?

1261
01:41:25,997 --> 01:41:28,750
Bay three access granted.

1262
01:41:34,255 --> 01:41:36,758
We are a go on Code 310.

1263
01:41:36,841 --> 01:41:39,677
Citizens of The Colony are
to be considered hostile.

1264
01:41:39,761 --> 01:41:42,263
Program all synthetics to use lethal force.

1265
01:41:42,347 --> 01:41:46,017
Repeat, citizens of The Colony
are to be considered hostile.

1266
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:48,144
We are a go on Code 310.

1267
01:43:11,394 --> 01:43:17,108
Time travel to The Colony:
approximately 17 minutes.

1268
01:43:40,298 --> 01:43:43,885
This is Aristotle 8. Can you give me
that rover ID again? You're breaking up.

1269
01:43:44,010 --> 01:43:45,011
Was that a nine?

1270
01:44:06,949 --> 01:44:08,493
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1271
01:44:09,952 --> 01:44:11,371
We got to get off this thing.

1272
01:44:11,454 --> 01:44:12,663
Now.

1273
01:44:15,333 --> 01:44:17,502
Your father... I'm so sorry.

1274
01:44:20,254 --> 01:44:22,507
- All those things that Cohaagen said...
- He was lying.

1275
01:44:22,965 --> 01:44:24,258
I couldn't have betrayed you.

1276
01:44:25,510 --> 01:44:26,886
I told you I'd find you.

1277
01:44:28,971 --> 01:44:31,808
I remember. My whole life,

1278
01:44:33,476 --> 01:44:35,061
only one memory stayed with me.

1279
01:44:36,521 --> 01:44:37,688
They could never erase that.

1280
01:44:48,324 --> 01:44:50,243
Damage report in bay six.

1281
01:44:50,743 --> 01:44:52,370
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

1282
01:44:52,453 --> 01:44:54,372
All emergency personnel,

1283
01:44:54,455 --> 01:44:56,833
please report to bay six.

1284
01:44:59,335 --> 01:45:01,796
Prepare for gravity shift.

1285
01:45:01,879 --> 01:45:03,005
Drop your weapons!

1286
01:45:03,589 --> 01:45:04,882
Now!

1287
01:45:05,883 --> 01:45:07,218
Right now!

1288
01:45:11,931 --> 01:45:14,016
Lieutenant, we've
secured the prisoners attempting escape

1289
01:45:14,100 --> 01:45:15,393
on level nine.

1290
01:45:15,726 --> 01:45:17,979
The prisoner in bay six
was just caught attempting escape.

1291
01:45:18,062 --> 01:45:20,106
She was with a second individual, male.

1292
01:45:20,731 --> 01:45:21,983
That's him.

1293
01:45:22,066 --> 01:45:23,526
Deal with it.

1294
01:45:24,569 --> 01:45:26,237
Come on.

1295
01:45:29,907 --> 01:45:30,950
And the bag.

1296
01:45:32,577 --> 01:45:33,703
Do it.

1297
01:45:34,745 --> 01:45:37,874
Team leader two, team leader two.
Seventh level prison...

1298
01:46:25,087 --> 01:46:26,797
Entering core.

1299
01:46:44,148 --> 01:46:45,191
It's okay.

1300
01:46:45,274 --> 01:46:47,068
They're in stasis.

1301
01:46:47,151 --> 01:46:48,486
Okay.

1302
01:47:05,211 --> 01:47:06,254
Shit.

1303
01:47:11,592 --> 01:47:14,595
Attention, emergency hatch cannot deploy

1304
01:47:14,679 --> 01:47:16,347
-while in zero gravity.
- What are you doing?

1305
01:47:16,430 --> 01:47:18,766
Hauser, these doors don't open for a reason.

1306
01:47:18,849 --> 01:47:20,268
We'll wait till it passes the core.

1307
01:47:20,726 --> 01:47:22,103
Then we go.

1308
01:47:25,231 --> 01:47:26,315
Shit.

1309
01:47:26,399 --> 01:47:27,942
Gravity reversing.

1310
01:47:28,025 --> 01:47:29,235
Come on.

1311
01:47:50,798 --> 01:47:51,841
Take this.

1312
01:47:57,096 --> 01:47:58,764
Hatch deployed.

1313
01:47:58,848 --> 01:48:01,767
Commencing deceleration.

1314
01:48:07,732 --> 01:48:08,983
Go!

1315
01:48:16,991 --> 01:48:18,826
- Move!
- Hatch deployed.

1316
01:48:18,909 --> 01:48:20,911
Commencing deceleration.

1317
01:48:28,461 --> 01:48:29,795
They're headed topside.

1318
01:48:30,963 --> 01:48:32,131
What?

1319
01:48:32,214 --> 01:48:33,966
I'm going after them.

1320
01:48:34,050 --> 01:48:35,634
Lori, no.

1321
01:48:36,802 --> 01:48:39,096
If they make it up top, I will deal with them.

1322
01:48:39,180 --> 01:48:41,474
Just make sure those troops are activated

1323
01:48:41,557 --> 01:48:43,351
and off-loaded the moment we arrive.

1324
01:48:43,434 --> 01:48:46,354
Hauser is not stopping this invasion.
Do you understand me?

1325
01:48:47,730 --> 01:48:48,939
Follow them.

1326
01:49:11,170 --> 01:49:13,464
Shit. We got to get to the aircraft bay.

1327
01:49:13,881 --> 01:49:14,965
Come on.

1328
01:49:16,008 --> 01:49:17,051
Go.

1329
01:49:20,388 --> 01:49:21,972
No! Hauser!

1330
01:49:33,025 --> 01:49:34,235
Secure him!

1331
01:49:52,795 --> 01:49:56,215
Government officials have issued
a Colony-wide state of emergency.

1332
01:49:56,298 --> 01:49:58,843
All civilians are to evacuate
their homes immediately

1333
01:49:58,926 --> 01:50:01,053
and head to the nearest No Zone shelters

1334
01:50:01,137 --> 01:50:03,013
outside The Colony border.

1335
01:50:03,097 --> 01:50:07,393
Officials are urging everyone
to comply with the evacuation orders.

1336
01:50:07,476 --> 01:50:09,728
Continued bombings
on Resistance holdouts...

1337
01:50:25,327 --> 01:50:26,787
The Fall secured.

1338
01:50:26,871 --> 01:50:29,707
Bays three through 87
now armed and active.

1339
01:50:31,250 --> 01:50:33,210
Let's get them on the move now.

1340
01:51:10,789 --> 01:51:12,958
You really are a disappointment, Hauser.

1341
01:51:21,759 --> 01:51:24,762
I'm afraid it's time to erase
those memories for good.

1342
01:51:27,264 --> 01:51:28,474
Good-bye, old friend.

1343
01:51:46,408 --> 01:51:48,702
Weapon systems activated.

1344
01:52:44,550 --> 01:52:46,302
Ammo chamber is empty.

1345
01:52:46,385 --> 01:52:47,469
Come on.

1346
01:53:32,598 --> 01:53:35,184
- Weapons systems reloading.
- Shit, come on.

1347
01:53:35,267 --> 01:53:37,770
You really thought
that would stop an entire invasion?

1348
01:53:38,395 --> 01:53:40,564
No, but I think this Will.

1349
01:54:37,621 --> 01:54:38,997
Look at you.

1350
01:54:40,249 --> 01:54:41,500
You're still fighting

1351
01:54:41,583 --> 01:54:43,001
and you don't even know who you are.

1352
01:54:43,836 --> 01:54:46,004
I may not remember who I was,

1353
01:54:46,088 --> 01:54:48,132
but I know who I am.

1354
01:55:13,323 --> 01:55:15,826
Say hello to my wife for me.

1355
01:55:26,295 --> 01:55:28,130
Come on! Run!

1356
01:55:54,072 --> 01:55:55,866
Come on. Come on!

1357
01:56:11,632 --> 01:56:12,925
Go!

1358
01:57:03,475 --> 01:57:04,518
What is it?

1359
01:57:04,601 --> 01:57:05,769
It'll be fine.

1360
01:57:46,685 --> 01:57:47,769
Hey, hey.

1361
01:57:47,853 --> 01:57:49,271
Hey, wake up.

1362
01:57:49,354 --> 01:57:51,356
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

1363
01:57:51,440 --> 01:57:52,774
Come on.

1364
01:57:53,609 --> 01:57:55,152
Come on, come on.

1365
01:57:56,028 --> 01:57:57,154
Hey, wake up.

1366
01:57:58,113 --> 01:57:59,615
Hey!

1367
01:58:01,199 --> 01:58:02,659
Come on, wake up.

1368
01:58:03,243 --> 01:58:04,328
Wake up.

1369
01:58:29,895 --> 01:58:31,146
Tell us your fantasy.

1370
01:58:31,229 --> 01:58:32,940
We'll give you the memory.

1371
01:58:33,023 --> 01:58:34,733
Don't mess with your mind, man.

1372
01:58:35,067 --> 01:58:35,901
It ain't worth it.

1373
01:58:35,984 --> 01:58:37,235
Secret agent.

1374
01:58:37,319 --> 01:58:38,612
That's you. Right?

1375
01:58:47,204 --> 01:58:48,246
Hi.

1376
01:58:50,791 --> 01:58:51,875
Hey.

1377
01:58:54,002 --> 01:58:55,253
Hey.

1378
01:58:56,088 --> 01:58:57,422
Are you okay?

1379
01:59:00,217 --> 01:59:01,468
Yeah.

1380
01:59:02,094 --> 01:59:04,054
We did it.

1381
01:59:19,277 --> 01:59:20,362
No!

1382
01:59:20,779 --> 01:59:21,822
Hey!

1383
01:59:21,905 --> 01:59:23,115
There's no scar on your hand.

1384
01:59:23,782 --> 01:59:24,866
Hey, hey!

1385
01:59:25,158 --> 01:59:26,535
Come on!

1386
01:59:46,930 --> 01:59:48,557
Did you think I'd let you leave

1387
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:50,308
without a kiss good-bye?

1388
01:59:57,315 --> 01:59:59,526
"Till death do us part," right, baby?

1389
02:00:00,152 --> 02:00:01,194
That's right.

1390
02:00:08,577 --> 02:00:09,578
Drop the weapon now!

1391
02:00:09,661 --> 02:00:10,996
It's all right. It's him.

1392
02:00:20,505 --> 02:00:21,590
You okay, sir?

1393
02:00:21,673 --> 02:00:23,633
- Yeah.
- You sure?

1394
02:00:24,342 --> 02:00:26,136
We've got a medic down in here.

1395
02:00:50,869 --> 02:00:52,329
Oh, my God.

1396
02:00:56,875 --> 02:00:58,210
Thank you.

1397
02:00:59,044 --> 02:01:02,631
People are spilling into the streets
all across The Colony,

1398
02:01:02,714 --> 02:01:04,966
celebrating what many hope will finally be

1399
02:01:05,050 --> 02:01:07,260
a path to an independent nation.

1400
02:01:07,344 --> 02:01:08,386
A new page in history

1401
02:01:08,470 --> 02:01:11,306
has been turned
as the invasion so many feared

1402
02:01:11,389 --> 02:01:13,058
ended with the destruction of The Fall,

1403
02:01:13,141 --> 02:01:17,062
a longtime symbol of economic
and political oppression.

1404
02:01:17,145 --> 02:01:19,815
No word yet on the fate
of Chancellor Cohaagen,

1405
02:01:19,898 --> 02:01:23,944
but we are being told that he perished
along with his forces.

1406
02:01:31,910 --> 02:01:32,994
Jesus Christ.

1407
02:01:33,370 --> 02:01:34,412
I know.

1408
02:01:34,496 --> 02:01:35,789
It's hard to believe, isn't it?

1409
02:01:52,264 --> 02:01:55,141
Hey, what is it?

1410
02:01:59,563 --> 02:02:00,730
Hey,

1411
02:02:00,856 --> 02:02:02,065
you all right?

1412
02:02:02,566 --> 02:02:04,359
Yeah.

1413
02:02:07,153 --> 02:02:08,196
Yeah, I'm fine.

1414
02:02:08,321 --> 02:02:09,573
You sure?
