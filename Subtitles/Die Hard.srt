00:00:55,573 --> 00:00:58,867
You don't like flyin', do you?

3
00:00:58,951 --> 00:01:01,828
What gives you that idea?

4
00:01:03,247 --> 00:01:07,751
You wanna know the secret
to surviving air travel?

5
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:11,004
After you get where you're going,
take off your shoes and your socks.

6
00:01:11,089 --> 00:01:15,675
Then you walk around on the rug barefoot
and make fists with your toes.

7
00:01:16,886 --> 00:01:19,054
Fists with your toes?

8
00:01:19,138 --> 00:01:21,515
I know, I know. It sounds crazy.

9
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:23,600
Trust me. I've been doin' it
for nine years.

10
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:26,728
Yes, sir. Better than a shower
and a hot cup of coffee.

11
00:01:26,813 --> 00:01:29,314
Okay.

12
00:01:39,158 --> 00:01:41,034
It's okay.
I'm a cop.

13
00:01:43,913 --> 00:01:47,290
Trust me. I've been
doin' this for 11 years.

14
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:49,876
On behalf of your captain and crew...

15
00:01:49,961 --> 00:01:52,629
we'd like to welcome you
to Los Angeles.

16
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:54,881
Have a very Merry Christmas.

17
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:09,646
Flight 247 to Tucson now boarding at Gate 14.

18
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:14,359
Flight 247 to Tucson
now boarding at Gate 14.

19
00:02:17,363 --> 00:02:21,366
Mr. Edward Machowski,
please report to the white courtesy phone.

20
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:28,999
Ah.

21
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,084
How do you do?

22
00:02:43,431 --> 00:02:47,392
Ladies and gentlemen!
Ladies and gentlemen!

23
00:02:47,476 --> 00:02:50,061
I want to congratulate
each and every one of you...

24
00:02:50,146 --> 00:02:54,399
for making this one of the greatest years
in the history of the Nakatomi Corporation.

25
00:02:58,112 --> 00:03:03,325
On behalf of the chief executive officer,
Mr. Ozu, and the board of directors...

26
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:07,787
we thank you, one and all, and wish you
a Merry Christmas and a happy New Year!

27
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:15,378
Hey, Holly, what about
dinner tonight, huh?

28
00:03:15,463 --> 00:03:17,881
Harry, it's Christmas Eve.

29
00:03:17,965 --> 00:03:20,967
Families, stockings.

30
00:03:22,261 --> 00:03:24,179
Chestnuts.

31
00:03:24,263 --> 00:03:26,348
Rudolph and Frosty.

32
00:03:26,432 --> 00:03:28,391
Any of these things ring a bell?

33
00:03:28,476 --> 00:03:33,271
Actually, I was thinkin' more of
mulled wine, a nice aged Brie...

34
00:03:33,356 --> 00:03:35,273
and a roaring fireplace.

35
00:03:35,358 --> 00:03:37,901
You know what I'm sayin'?

36
00:03:40,196 --> 00:03:43,531
Ginny, it's 5:40. Go join the party.
Have some champagne.

37
00:03:43,616 --> 00:03:46,159
You're makin' me feel
like Ebenezer Scrooge.

38
00:03:46,244 --> 00:03:49,829
Thanks a lot, Ms. Gennero.
Do you think the baby can handle a little sip?

39
00:03:49,914 --> 00:03:52,749
That baby's ready to tend bar.

40
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,793
Last chance.

41
00:03:54,877 --> 00:03:57,712
Bye.

42
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,679
McClane residence.
Lucy McClane speaking.

43
00:04:05,763 --> 00:04:10,100
Hello, Lucy McClane.
This is your mother speaking.

44
00:04:10,184 --> 00:04:13,186
Mommy! When are you coming home?

45
00:04:13,271 --> 00:04:17,565
Pretty soon. Pretty soon.
You'll be in bed when I get there though.

46
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:20,151
Let me talk to Paulina, okay, hon?

47
00:04:20,236 --> 00:04:24,322
And no snoopin' around the house
looking for presents.

48
00:04:24,407 --> 00:04:26,866
Is Daddy coming home with you?

49
00:04:29,078 --> 00:04:33,164
Well, we'll see what
Santa and Mommy can do, okay?

50
00:04:33,249 --> 00:04:35,250
Put Paulina on.
Bye, honey.

51
00:04:35,334 --> 00:04:37,252
Paulina!

52
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:44,301
Hola, Mrs. Holly.

53
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:47,595
Um, did Mr. McClane call?

54
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,308
No, Mrs. Holly.
No telefonó.

55
00:04:51,392 --> 00:04:54,311
Well, he probably just didn't
have time before his flight.

56
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:58,398
Um, it might be a good idea
to make up the spare bedroom just in case.

57
00:04:58,482 --> 00:05:01,151
Sí, Mrs. Holly.
I do that already.

58
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:03,737
What would I do
without you, Paulina?

59
00:05:29,013 --> 00:05:30,930
California.

60
00:05:41,817 --> 00:05:43,735
Excuse me.

61
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:45,820
Hey, I'm John McClane.

62
00:05:45,905 --> 00:05:48,782
Argyle. I'm your limo driver.

63
00:05:51,035 --> 00:05:53,119
Nice bear.

64
00:05:57,458 --> 00:06:01,711
Okay, Argyle.
What do we do now?

65
00:06:01,796 --> 00:06:04,214
I was, uh, hopin' you could tell me.

66
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:06,633
It's my first time drivin' a limo.

67
00:06:06,717 --> 00:06:09,803
Oh, that's okay. It's my
first time ridin' in one.

68
00:06:09,929 --> 00:06:12,722
Relax. We got everything
in this mug, man.

69
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:16,226
Look at this -  CD, C.B., TV...

70
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,188
telephone, full bar, VHS.

71
00:06:20,272 --> 00:06:23,691
if your friend's hot to trot,
I know a few mama bears we can hook up with.

72
00:06:25,778 --> 00:06:28,279
- Or is he married?
- He's married.

73
00:06:28,364 --> 00:06:30,365
Okay.

74
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:34,744
Oh, sorry about that.
It's the girl's day off.

75
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:37,747
I didn't know you were
gonna sit up front.

76
00:06:37,832 --> 00:06:39,791
So, uh, your lady live out here?

77
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,918
About the past six months.

78
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:45,004
Meaning you still live in New York.

79
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:48,425
- You always ask this many questions, Argyle?

80
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:52,011
Sorry, man. I used to drive a cab, and, uh,
people would expect a little chitchat.

81
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,433
- So, you divorced?
- Just drive the car, man.

82
00:06:56,517 --> 00:07:00,395
Hey, come on. You divorced?
You separated? She beat you up?

83
00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:07,277
He had a good job.
Turned into a great career.

84
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:10,196
Ah, that meant she had to move here.

85
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:12,449
You're very fast, Argyle.

86
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:15,201
So why didn't you come?

87
00:07:17,455 --> 00:07:20,039
Well, why didn't you come
with her, man? What's up?

88
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:23,460
'Cause I'm a New York cop.

89
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:26,963
l got a six-month backlog of New York
scumbags I'm still trying to put behind bars.

90
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:29,174
I can't just pick up
and go that easy.

91
00:07:29,258 --> 00:07:31,676
In other words, you thought
she wasn't gonna make it out here...

92
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,678
and she'd come crawling
on back to you...

93
00:07:33,762 --> 00:07:36,306
so why bother to pack, right?

94
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,725
Like I said,
you're very fast, Argyle.

95
00:07:38,809 --> 00:07:40,894
You mind if we hear some tunes?

96
00:07:44,148 --> 00:07:47,567
Hey, that'll work.

97
00:07:48,903 --> 00:07:50,904
Don't you got any Christmas music?

98
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,907
This is Christmas music.

99
00:08:22,853 --> 00:08:26,439
So your lady sees you, you run
into each other's arms, the music comes up...

100
00:08:26,524 --> 00:08:29,150
and you live happily
ever after, right?

101
00:08:29,235 --> 00:08:32,153
I can live with that.

102
00:08:32,238 --> 00:08:35,698
So if it doesn't work out, man,
you got a place to stay?

103
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:39,202
- I'll find a place.
- I tell you what.

104
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:41,913
I'm gonna pull in
the parking garage and I'll wait.

105
00:08:41,997 --> 00:08:44,207
You score, you give me a call
on the car phone.

106
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,209
I'll take your bags to the desk.

107
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:48,586
You strike out,
I'll get you a hotel.

108
00:08:48,671 --> 00:08:50,838
You're all right, Argyle.

109
00:08:50,923 --> 00:08:53,800
Just remember that
when you sign for the tip.

110
00:09:16,991 --> 00:09:18,908
Hi.

111
00:09:18,993 --> 00:09:21,786
- Good evening.
- I'm here to see Holly McClane.

112
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,871
Just type it in there.

113
00:09:29,003 --> 00:09:31,212
Cute toy.

114
00:09:31,297 --> 00:09:34,674
Yeah. You have to take a leak,
it'll even help you find your zipper.

115
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:52,900
Christ.

116
00:09:57,573 --> 00:09:59,574
13th floor.

117
00:09:59,658 --> 00:10:02,577
The party. They're the only ones
left in the building.

118
00:10:02,661 --> 00:10:06,456
Take the express elevator.
Get off where you hear the noise.

119
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,458
Thanks.

120
00:11:05,974 --> 00:11:08,643
- Champagne, sir?
- Yeah. Thanks.

121
00:11:43,637 --> 00:11:45,555
Oh, I'm sorry.

122
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:48,141
Hey! Merry Christmas!

123
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:55,898
Jesus.
Fuckin' California.

124
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:58,067
I couldn't agree with you more.

125
00:11:58,193 --> 00:12:00,153
Why don't I talk to him right now?

126
00:12:01,363 --> 00:12:03,281
Hi. I'm looking for, uh -

127
00:12:03,365 --> 00:12:05,283
- Holly Gennero.
- Yeah.

128
00:12:05,367 --> 00:12:08,661
- Then you must be John McClane. Joe Takagi.
- Hi.

129
00:12:08,746 --> 00:12:10,747
- How was your ride in?
- Nice.

130
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:14,125
- l have you to thank for that?
- It seemed the least we could do.

131
00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:16,127
It's quite a place you have here.

132
00:12:16,211 --> 00:12:18,212
It will be
if we ever get it finished.

133
00:12:18,297 --> 00:12:20,381
There are still several
floors under construction.

134
00:12:20,466 --> 00:12:24,051
Holly went to the vault room to fax some
documents. She should be back any minute.

135
00:12:24,136 --> 00:12:26,512
In the meanwhile,
her office is right back here.

136
00:12:28,766 --> 00:12:30,975
Ellis.

137
00:12:33,061 --> 00:12:36,189
l was just makin' a call,
and this was, uh, the nearest phone.

138
00:12:36,273 --> 00:12:39,692
I want you to meet
John McClane, Holly's husband.

139
00:12:41,236 --> 00:12:44,864
Holly's policeman. Ellis is in charge
of international development.

140
00:12:44,948 --> 00:12:47,283
Heard a heck of a lot about you.

141
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:49,327
Missed some.

142
00:12:51,413 --> 00:12:55,958
Uh, could I get you anything?
Food, cake, uh, some watered-down champagne?

143
00:12:56,043 --> 00:12:59,045
No, thank you.
I'm fine.

144
00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:02,048
You throw quite a party.

145
00:13:02,132 --> 00:13:04,801
l didn't realize they
celebrated Christmas in Japan.

146
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:09,430
Hey, we're flexible. Pearl Harbor didn't
work out, so we got you with tape decks.

147
00:13:12,184 --> 00:13:15,978
Actually, it's kind of sort of a double
celebration. We, uh, closed a pretty big deal today.

148
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:17,897
And a lot of it was due to Holly.

149
00:13:18,023 --> 00:13:19,816
- Am I right, Jo-Jo?
- Go ahead without me.

150
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,527
I'll be about 4 minutes.

151
00:13:25,656 --> 00:13:27,657
John.

152
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:32,829
Have you met everyone?

153
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:35,164
No, we've been sticking him
with spears.

154
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:37,333
of course he has.

155
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:40,044
She was made for the business.
Tough as nails.

156
00:13:40,128 --> 00:13:43,965
- Yeah.
- I was hoping you made that flight.

157
00:13:44,049 --> 00:13:46,634
Show him the watch.

158
00:13:46,718 --> 00:13:49,929
- Later.
- Well, go on. Show him.
What, are you embarrassed?

159
00:13:50,013 --> 00:13:54,058
It's just a small token
of appreciation for all her hard work.

160
00:13:54,142 --> 00:13:56,143
It's a Rolex.

161
00:13:56,228 --> 00:13:58,187
I'm sure I'll see it later.

162
00:13:58,272 --> 00:14:00,523
Is there a place
where l could wash up?

163
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:03,067
Sure.

164
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:21,460
You'll have to forgive Ellis.
He gets very depressed this time of year.

165
00:14:23,005 --> 00:14:25,923
He thought he was
God's greatest gift, you know?

166
00:14:26,008 --> 00:14:28,217
Yeah, l know the type.

167
00:14:28,302 --> 00:14:31,387
I think he's got his eye on you.

168
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:35,391
It's okay. I have my eye
on his private bathroom.

169
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:37,560
Where you staying?

170
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:41,480
Things happened so fast, I didn't get a chance
to ask you on the phone.

171
00:14:41,565 --> 00:14:45,234
- Cappy Roberts retired out here.
- Oh, yeah?

172
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:48,446
- Told me I could bunk in with him.
- Cappy retired, huh?

173
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,698
- Where's he live?
- "Ramona."

174
00:14:50,782 --> 00:14:52,867
Pomona.

175
00:14:52,951 --> 00:14:55,536
- Huh?
- Pomona.

176
00:14:55,621 --> 00:14:58,456
- Pomona.
- Yeah.

177
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,959
God, you'll be in the car
half the time.

178
00:15:02,044 --> 00:15:05,588
Why don't we make it easy?
I have a spare bedroom.

179
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:08,507
I mean, it's not huge
or anything, but...

180
00:15:08,592 --> 00:15:12,011
the kids would love
to have you at the house.

181
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:16,140
They would, huh?

182
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:20,394
I would too.

183
00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:22,939
Oh! Ooh!

184
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:25,024
Sorry.

185
00:15:32,074 --> 00:15:34,533
I missed you.

186
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,042
I guess you didn't miss
my name, though, huh?

187
00:15:43,126 --> 00:15:47,088
Except maybe when
you're signing checks?

188
00:15:47,172 --> 00:15:49,215
Since when did you
start using "Ms. Gennero"?

189
00:15:52,469 --> 00:15:55,680
This is a Japanese company.
They figure a married woman's got one foot -

190
00:15:55,764 --> 00:15:57,932
You are a married woman, Holly.
You're married to me.

191
00:15:58,016 --> 00:16:00,893
Are we gonna have this conversation again?
We did this in July.

192
00:16:00,978 --> 00:16:03,187
- We never finished this conversation in July.
- I had an opportunity.

193
00:16:03,271 --> 00:16:05,606
- l had to take it.
- Right. No matter what the consequences...

194
00:16:05,691 --> 00:16:07,817
no matter what it did to our marriage,
you had to.

195
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:10,861
It didn't do anything except maybe change
your idea of what our marriage should be.

196
00:16:10,946 --> 00:16:13,864
I don't think you have a clue what my idea
of our marriage should be.

197
00:16:13,949 --> 00:16:16,409
- I know exactly what your idea
of our marriage should be.

198
00:16:16,493 --> 00:16:18,244
Ms. Gennero, I -

199
00:16:19,997 --> 00:16:23,582
- Excuse me.
- Hi.

200
00:16:24,835 --> 00:16:26,961
Um, Mr. Takagi is looking for you.

201
00:16:27,045 --> 00:16:30,423
- He- He wants you to say something to the troops.
- Thank you.

202
00:16:35,053 --> 00:16:39,682
Speech time.
Be back in a few minutes.

203
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:52,945
That's great, John.

204
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:55,364
Good job.
Very mature.

205
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:48,250
So Kareem rebounds, right?
Feeds Worthy on the break.

206
00:17:48,335 --> 00:17:51,504
Over to A.C., to Magic,
then back to Worthy, right?

207
00:17:52,964 --> 00:17:55,424
Boom! Two points.

208
00:17:58,261 --> 00:18:00,179
We're in.

209
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:31,997
Left.

210
00:20:34,251 --> 00:20:36,835
Right, and again left.

211
00:21:07,242 --> 00:21:09,785
Son of a bitch.

212
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:13,956
Fists with your toes.

213
00:21:45,113 --> 00:21:47,031
Yeah, Argyle.

214
00:21:47,115 --> 00:21:50,117
- Hey, Mac! How's it goin' up there?
- Oh, all right. Where are you?

215
00:21:50,201 --> 00:21:53,162
I'm kickin' it in the garage.
What's the word with you and your lady, man?

216
00:21:53,246 --> 00:21:55,539
Uh, the vote's not in yet.

217
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:06,800
- Hey Brother.
- Just a moment.

218
00:22:06,885 --> 00:22:08,802
- No, no ... not yet, just wait ...

219
00:22:26,488 --> 00:22:28,405
Argyle?

220
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:31,116
Mac, you there? Hello?

221
00:22:39,751 --> 00:22:41,960
You know the number.
Use it!

222
00:24:14,012 --> 00:24:18,849
Stay calm. Everything's gonna be fine.
Everything's gonna be fine.

223
00:24:37,785 --> 00:24:39,786
Shit!

224
00:24:43,124 --> 00:24:45,584
Think. Think.

225
00:25:02,101 --> 00:25:07,981
Ladies and gentlemen.

226
00:25:14,989 --> 00:25:19,034
"Due to the Nakatomi
Corporation's legacy of greed around the globe...

227
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:23,413
"they're about to be taught a lesson
in the real use of power.

228
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:26,833
You will be witnesses."

229
00:25:29,045 --> 00:25:31,004
Now...

230
00:25:31,089 --> 00:25:33,006
where is Mr. Takagi?

231
00:25:35,677 --> 00:25:39,888
Joseph Yoshinobu Takagi.

232
00:25:39,973 --> 00:25:42,391
Born, Kyoto, 1937.

233
00:25:42,475 --> 00:25:44,393
Don't move.

234
00:25:44,477 --> 00:25:50,023
Family emigrated
to San Pedro, California, 1939.

235
00:25:50,108 --> 00:25:54,570
Interned at Manzanar, 1942 to '43.

236
00:25:54,654 --> 00:25:59,575
Scholarship student,
University of California...

237
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:01,660
1955.

238
00:26:05,832 --> 00:26:10,586
Law degree, Stanford, 1962.

239
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:15,424
M.B.A., Harvard, 1970.

240
00:26:15,508 --> 00:26:18,093
President, Nakatomi Trading.

241
00:26:18,177 --> 00:26:20,429
Vice Chairman,
Nakatomi Investment Group.

242
00:26:20,513 --> 00:26:22,472
Enough.

243
00:26:23,683 --> 00:26:27,269
And father of five.

244
00:26:27,353 --> 00:26:29,354
I am Takagi.

245
00:26:30,607 --> 00:26:32,524
How do you do?

246
00:26:32,609 --> 00:26:34,943
It's a pleasure to meet you.

247
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:50,250
Computers. 32, construction.
33, computers.

248
00:27:03,264 --> 00:27:05,223
Nice suit.

249
00:27:06,267 --> 00:27:08,518
John Philips, London.

250
00:27:10,563 --> 00:27:12,773
I have two myself.

251
00:27:12,857 --> 00:27:15,901
Rumor has it Arafat buys his there.

252
00:27:20,698 --> 00:27:23,200
- In there?
- On the left. On the left.

253
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:50,519
"And when Alexander saw the
breadth of his domain, he wept...

254
00:27:50,603 --> 00:27:53,772
for there were no more
worlds to conquer."

255
00:27:57,985 --> 00:28:01,154
Benefits of a classical education.

256
00:28:01,239 --> 00:28:05,325
Oh, that's beautiful.

257
00:28:06,828 --> 00:28:09,746
I always enjoyed to make models
when I was a boy.

258
00:28:09,831 --> 00:28:14,960
The exactness, the attention
to every conceivable detail.

259
00:28:15,044 --> 00:28:16,962
It's beautiful.

260
00:28:17,046 --> 00:28:19,965
Is this what this is all about?
Our project in Indonesia?

261
00:28:21,426 --> 00:28:23,844
Contrary to what you people may think...

262
00:28:23,928 --> 00:28:27,222
we're going to develop that region,
not exploit it.

263
00:28:27,306 --> 00:28:32,561
I believe you.
I read the article in Forbes.

264
00:28:34,147 --> 00:28:37,065
Mr. Takagi.

265
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:40,444
I could talk about industrialization
and men's fashions all day...

266
00:28:40,528 --> 00:28:42,571
but I'm afraid work must intrude...

267
00:28:42,655 --> 00:28:46,908
and my associate, Theo,
has some questions for you.

268
00:28:46,993 --> 00:28:50,162
Sort of fill-in-the-blanks
questions, actually.

269
00:28:59,589 --> 00:29:02,299
I don't have that code.

270
00:29:02,383 --> 00:29:05,761
You broke in here
to access our computer?

271
00:29:05,845 --> 00:29:09,389
Any information you could get, when they
wake up in Tokyo in the morning, they'll change it.

272
00:29:09,474 --> 00:29:12,058
You won't be able to blackmail
our executives, threaten our profit -

273
00:29:12,143 --> 00:29:14,519
Sit down!

274
00:29:24,197 --> 00:29:28,325
Mr. Takagi, I'm really
not interested in your computer.

275
00:29:33,122 --> 00:29:37,459
But I need the code key
because I am interested...

276
00:29:37,543 --> 00:29:41,546
in the $640 million
in negotiable bearer bonds...

277
00:29:41,631 --> 00:29:44,633
that you have locked in your vault.

278
00:29:44,717 --> 00:29:48,512
And the computer controls the vault.

279
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,973
You want money?

280
00:29:52,058 --> 00:29:54,476
What kind of terrorists are you?

281
00:29:57,855 --> 00:30:00,232
Who said we were terrorists?

282
00:30:08,115 --> 00:30:11,660
Mr. Takagi, I sympathize
with your reluctance...

283
00:30:11,744 --> 00:30:16,414
but I'm sure you realize you're not dealing
with anything significant here.

284
00:30:16,499 --> 00:30:19,501
It's not as if it's
the education of your children.

285
00:30:19,585 --> 00:30:22,337
The bonds represent, at most...

286
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:25,841
10 days operating capital
for your parent organization.

287
00:30:25,925 --> 00:30:28,927
It's really no more than
a temporary inconvenience.

288
00:30:29,011 --> 00:30:30,929
Now...

289
00:30:35,184 --> 00:30:37,102
the code, please.

290
00:30:37,186 --> 00:30:39,312
It's useless to you.

291
00:30:39,397 --> 00:30:42,983
There are seven safeguards on our vault,
and the code key is only one of them.

292
00:30:43,067 --> 00:30:47,070
- You'll never get it open.
- Then there's no reason not to tell it to us.

293
00:30:47,154 --> 00:30:49,072
I told you.

294
00:30:49,156 --> 00:30:51,366
It's not over yet.

295
00:30:56,205 --> 00:31:00,083
That's a very nice suit, Mr. Takagi.

296
00:31:00,167 --> 00:31:02,627
It would be a shame to ruin it.

297
00:31:06,173 --> 00:31:08,633
I'm going to count to three.

298
00:31:08,718 --> 00:31:12,429
There will not be a four.

299
00:31:12,513 --> 00:31:15,473
Give me the code.

300
00:31:16,475 --> 00:31:18,435
One.

301
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:21,980
Two.

302
00:31:24,025 --> 00:31:26,067
- Three.
- I don't know it, I'm telling you.

303
00:31:26,152 --> 00:31:28,570
Get on a jet to Tokyo
and ask the chairman.

304
00:31:28,654 --> 00:31:30,697
I'm telling you, you're just gonna
have to kill me.

305
00:31:30,781 --> 00:31:32,991
Okay.

306
00:31:36,162 --> 00:31:39,664
We'll do it the hard way.
Tony, see if you can dispose of that.

307
00:31:39,749 --> 00:31:43,043
Karl, you'd better go and check on Heinrich's
work up on the machine floor.

308
00:32:07,485 --> 00:32:09,402
Nothing.

309
00:32:09,487 --> 00:32:11,613
See to Heinrich.

310
00:32:13,491 --> 00:32:18,411
Now, you can break the code?

311
00:32:18,496 --> 00:32:22,457
You didn't bring me along
for my charming personality.

312
00:32:27,922 --> 00:32:32,717
Argyle, tell me you heard the shots
and you're callin' the police right now.

313
00:32:32,802 --> 00:32:36,388
Of course I'm still comin' by later.

314
00:32:36,472 --> 00:32:39,182
Sweetheart, have l ever lied to you?

315
00:32:39,266 --> 00:32:41,893
My boss? He thinks
I'm on my way to Vegas.

316
00:32:42,895 --> 00:32:46,231
Uli, get up on the pipes.

317
00:32:46,315 --> 00:32:48,566
Marco, you go through here.

318
00:32:49,652 --> 00:32:51,569
I'll throw you the cord.

319
00:32:51,654 --> 00:32:53,655
Yeah.

320
00:32:55,491 --> 00:32:57,742
Hans, we're on the roof.

321
00:33:10,756 --> 00:33:12,757
Here.

322
00:33:15,886 --> 00:33:17,887
Uli!

323
00:33:24,562 --> 00:33:29,149
Thirty minutes to break the code.
Two hours - two and a half hours...

324
00:33:29,233 --> 00:33:31,776
for the five mechanicals,
at the minimum.

325
00:33:31,861 --> 00:33:34,487
The seventh lock, however,
is out of my hands.

326
00:33:57,428 --> 00:33:59,929
- I'm sorry.
- The 7th lock.

327
00:34:00,014 --> 00:34:04,809
The electromagnetic seal. You do understand
the circuits cannot be cut locally.

328
00:34:06,479 --> 00:34:08,605
Trust me.

329
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:12,067
Why the fuck didn't you
stop 'em, John?

330
00:34:13,569 --> 00:34:16,571
'Cause then you'd be
dead too, asshole.

331
00:34:16,655 --> 00:34:18,782
Think, goddamn it.
Think!

332
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:32,796
We've got a fire alarm.

333
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,798
Call 911.

334
00:34:34,882 --> 00:34:39,219
Give them the guard's name, the building code
number and cancel the alarm.

335
00:34:39,303 --> 00:34:41,554
Then disable the system.

336
00:34:44,016 --> 00:34:46,893
Eddie, on what floor
did the alarm go off?

337
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:50,522
Now? Should we go?

338
00:34:50,606 --> 00:34:52,524
Nein.

339
00:35:02,868 --> 00:35:06,788
Yes. Oh, baby,
come to papa. Come on.

340
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:09,707
Ah!

341
00:35:11,752 --> 00:35:14,796
Baby. Come on, baby.
Come on, baby.

342
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,549
Come to papa.
I'll kiss your fuckin' dalmatian.

343
00:35:20,886 --> 00:35:23,805
Oh, you stupid motherfuckers!
No! No!

344
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:26,391
Turn the fuckin' truck around!

345
00:35:59,341 --> 00:36:02,719
The fire has been
called off, my friend.

346
00:36:06,724 --> 00:36:09,267
No one is coming to help you.

347
00:36:13,355 --> 00:36:16,733
You might as well come out
and join the others.

348
00:36:19,278 --> 00:36:21,654
I promise l won't hurt you.

349
00:36:50,476 --> 00:36:54,187
Drop it, dickhead.
It's the police.

350
00:36:54,271 --> 00:36:58,149
- You won't hurt me.
- Oh, yeah? Why not?

351
00:36:58,234 --> 00:37:02,278
Because you're a policeman.
There are rules for policemen.

352
00:37:02,363 --> 00:37:05,949
Yeah. That's what
my captain keeps tellin' me.

353
00:37:17,169 --> 00:37:19,128
Drop that, motherfucker!
I'll fuckin' kill you!

354
00:37:25,302 --> 00:37:28,012
Come on! Come on!
I'll fuckin' rip your head off?

355
00:38:12,099 --> 00:38:14,767
You bet your ass I wish to proceed.

356
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:58,644
Nine million terrorists in the world, and I gotta
kill one with feet smaller than my sister.

357
00:39:49,822 --> 00:39:54,325
I wanted this to be professional, efficient,
adult, cooperative.

358
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:58,413
Not a lot to ask. Alas, your Mr. Takagi
did not see it that way...

359
00:39:58,497 --> 00:40:02,291
so he won't bejoining us
for the rest of his life.

360
00:40:04,211 --> 00:40:07,380
So we can go any way you want us.

361
00:40:07,464 --> 00:40:10,425
You can walk out of here
or be carried out.

362
00:40:10,509 --> 00:40:14,720
But have no illusions.
We are in charge.

363
00:40:15,973 --> 00:40:18,641
So, decide now, each of you.

364
00:40:19,685 --> 00:40:22,019
And, please remember...

365
00:40:23,105 --> 00:40:25,940
we have left nothing to chance.

366
00:40:34,366 --> 00:40:37,201
Get them back!

367
00:40:45,043 --> 00:40:47,587
"Now I have a machine gun.

368
00:40:49,506 --> 00:40:52,550
Ho-ho-ho."

369
00:40:55,554 --> 00:40:57,597
A security guard we missed?

370
00:40:57,681 --> 00:40:59,932
They're usually tired old policemen
growing fat on a pension.

371
00:41:00,017 --> 00:41:01,934
No, no.
This is something else.

372
00:41:02,019 --> 00:41:05,354
Oh, they're gonna kill us!

373
00:41:07,733 --> 00:41:12,570
What did I tell you?

374
00:41:12,654 --> 00:41:15,823
- We have to do something, Hans.
- Yes, we do.

375
00:41:15,908 --> 00:41:20,369
We have to tell Karl his brother is dead.
Tell him to come down.

376
00:41:20,454 --> 00:41:23,039
- Karl?
- Yeah?

377
00:41:23,123 --> 00:41:25,041
Karl, come down right away!

378
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:28,211
Franco, you and Fritz take
the body upstairs and out of sight.

379
00:41:28,295 --> 00:41:30,880
I don't want the hostages
to think too much.

380
00:41:30,964 --> 00:41:33,090
... come down right now ... quickly ...

381
00:42:35,279 --> 00:42:37,863
- I want blood!
- You'll have it.

382
00:42:37,948 --> 00:42:41,117
But let Heinrich plant the detonators
and Theo prepare the vault.

383
00:42:41,201 --> 00:42:43,494
After we call the police,
they'll waste hours trying to negotiate...

384
00:42:43,579 --> 00:42:46,080
and then you can tear the building apart
looking for this man.

385
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:49,041
But until then,
we do not alter the plan.

386
00:42:49,126 --> 00:42:51,711
And if he alters it?

387
00:42:56,508 --> 00:42:58,676
What do ya think?

388
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:02,597
Something's wrong.

389
00:43:02,681 --> 00:43:04,640
Cops?

390
00:43:04,725 --> 00:43:06,642
John.

391
00:43:06,727 --> 00:43:09,395
John? Aw, Christ.

392
00:43:09,479 --> 00:43:12,148
He could fuck this whole thing up.
What does he think he's doin'?

393
00:43:12,232 --> 00:43:14,609
- His job.
- Bullshit.

394
00:43:14,693 --> 00:43:16,777
His job's 3,000 miles away.

395
00:43:16,862 --> 00:43:18,779
Without him, we still have a chance.

396
00:43:18,864 --> 00:43:21,574
We might be able to get outta here.

397
00:43:21,658 --> 00:43:24,076
Tell that to Takagi.

398
00:43:47,476 --> 00:43:49,935
Mayday! Mayday!
Anyone copying? Channel 9.

399
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:51,979
Terrorists have seized
the Nakatomi building...

400
00:43:52,064 --> 00:43:54,023
and are holding at least
30 people hostage.

401
00:43:54,107 --> 00:43:57,193
I repeat, unknown number
of terrorists, six or more...

402
00:43:57,277 --> 00:44:00,655
armed with automatic weapons
at Nakatomi Plaza, Century City.

403
00:44:00,739 --> 00:44:03,366
- Where's the best place to transmit?
- Somebody answer me, goddamn it!

404
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:06,369
The roof! Go! Go!

405
00:44:08,497 --> 00:44:10,956
It's the same address as that fire signal.

406
00:44:11,041 --> 00:44:13,042
I'll handle it.

407
00:44:15,379 --> 00:44:19,173
Attention, whoever you are. This channel's
reserved for emergency calls only.

408
00:44:19,257 --> 00:44:22,593
No fuckin' shit, lady.
Do I sound like I'm orderin' a pizza?

409
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,858
No one kills him but me.

410
00:44:38,985 --> 00:44:41,028
They have already
killed one hostage.

411
00:44:41,113 --> 00:44:44,365
They are fortifying their positions
while you're jerkin' me off on the radio!

412
00:44:44,449 --> 00:44:46,367
Now, send a police backup A.S.A.P.!

413
00:44:46,451 --> 00:44:48,703
Sir, I've already told you,
this is a reserved channel.

414
00:44:48,787 --> 00:44:52,581
If this is an emergency call,
dial 911on your telephone.

415
00:44:52,666 --> 00:44:56,043
Otherwise, I'll have to report
this as an F.C.C. violation.

416
00:44:56,128 --> 00:44:58,713
Fine, report me!
Come the fuck down here and arrest me!

417
00:44:58,797 --> 00:45:01,590
Just send the police now!

418
00:45:01,675 --> 00:45:03,175
Ow!

419
00:45:07,097 --> 00:45:09,974
Whoa!

420
00:45:13,603 --> 00:45:16,981
See if there's a black-and-white
that can do a drive-by.

421
00:45:28,994 --> 00:45:30,911
I thought you guys
just ate doughnuts.

422
00:45:30,996 --> 00:45:33,539
They're for my wife.

423
00:45:33,623 --> 00:45:35,583
Yeah.

424
00:45:35,667 --> 00:45:39,128
- She's pregnant.
- Yeah.

425
00:45:39,212 --> 00:45:42,006
Bag it.

426
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:43,966
Big time.

427
00:45:46,762 --> 00:45:48,763
Thanks.

428
00:45:51,349 --> 00:45:53,768
Dispatch to 8-Lincoln-30, over.

429
00:45:53,852 --> 00:45:55,770
This is 8-Lincoln-30.
Come on in, over.

430
00:45:55,854 --> 00:45:59,648
Investigate a code 2
at Nakatomi Plaza, Century City.

431
00:45:59,733 --> 00:46:03,861
8-Lincoln-30 to Dispatch.
I'm on my way.

432
00:46:34,059 --> 00:46:36,685
Christ!

433
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,398
Girls.

434
00:48:04,482 --> 00:48:07,109
... in the attic ...

435
00:48:19,289 --> 00:48:22,499
Shit. Where the fuck is it?

436
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:45,731
Oh, my God.

437
00:48:52,113 --> 00:48:55,115
- Hans, we have a machine gun ...
- Have you found him?
- ... he's in the furnace area of the roof ...

438
00:48:59,245 --> 00:49:01,538
 - He's in the furnace area of the roof ...
- Where is Karl?

439
00:49:01,623 --> 00:49:04,124
- He's in the elevator shaft.
- Did you hear that?

440
00:49:04,209 --> 00:49:07,419
Perfect. The elevators are
locked off. He can't escape.

441
00:49:07,504 --> 00:49:09,421
Just shut him in and come back down.

442
00:49:13,176 --> 00:49:15,469
Oh, fuck.

443
00:49:20,433 --> 00:49:24,770
Karl, the police are probably
on their way already. Karl!

444
00:49:45,875 --> 00:49:47,793
Christ.

445
00:49:52,298 --> 00:49:54,633
I can stall them,
but not if they hear gunshots.

446
00:49:54,718 --> 00:49:57,219
lf you lock him in, he'll be neutralized

447
00:51:02,744 --> 00:51:05,996
"Come out to the coast.
We'll get together, have a few laughs."

448
00:51:13,213 --> 00:51:16,715
Now l know what
a TV dinner feels like.

449
00:52:23,533 --> 00:52:25,742
Karl, come!
Police! Hurry ...

450
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:14,541
It's about time.

451
00:53:20,006 --> 00:53:22,382
No signs of disturbance, Dispatch.

452
00:53:22,467 --> 00:53:25,844
8-L-30, roger. Possible crank call.
Check the area again and confirm.

453
00:53:31,643 --> 00:53:34,645
Who's driving this car,
Stevie Wonder?

454
00:53:37,106 --> 00:53:40,692
I do see a guard inside.
I'm gonna go in for a closer look.

455
00:53:40,777 --> 00:53:42,778
8-L-30, Roger. Use caution.

456
00:53:45,698 --> 00:53:49,785
- Eddie?
- I had a feeling you'd be callin'.

457
00:54:13,393 --> 00:54:15,852
Good evenin', officer.
What can I do for you?

458
00:54:19,816 --> 00:54:24,817
- How many are there?
- Just one man.
- Someone is "jumping the gun".

459
00:54:27,323 --> 00:54:29,408
We had that false alarm, you know?

460
00:54:29,492 --> 00:54:33,745
Ask me, that god-damn computer
sent you out on another wild goose chase.

461
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:37,207
They've been chasing bugs
in this system ever since they installed it.

462
00:54:37,292 --> 00:54:41,378
- Notre Dame on top of USC.
- Aw, shit!

463
00:54:41,462 --> 00:54:44,006
Come on. l got 50 bucks
bet on them assholes.

464
00:54:45,675 --> 00:54:49,761
Come on. Come on.
Where's the fucking cavalry?

465
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:06,899
He's on the 34th floor. Go, hurry.

466
00:55:13,036 --> 00:55:15,537
It was good for 52 yards.

467
00:55:15,621 --> 00:55:17,831
You don't mind if I take
a look around, do you?

468
00:55:17,915 --> 00:55:20,417
No, help yourself.

469
00:55:20,501 --> 00:55:25,130
Seven to nothing, Notre Dame.
The Irish driving 74 yards in eight plays-

470
00:55:27,216 --> 00:55:31,094
This fucking -
Freeze, motherfucker! Drop it!

471
00:55:31,179 --> 00:55:33,472
- Don't! Don't!
- Put that fucking gun down! Put the gun down!

472
00:55:33,556 --> 00:55:36,183
- Okay! Don't shoot!
- Drop the fucking gun!

473
00:55:36,267 --> 00:55:37,768
Marco, duck!

474
00:55:54,452 --> 00:55:57,371
Aw, the hell with this.

475
00:56:04,462 --> 00:56:07,172
You are done!

476
00:56:07,256 --> 00:56:10,300
No more table.
Where are you going, pal?

477
00:56:10,385 --> 00:56:14,638
Next time you have
a chance to kill someone, don't hesitate.

478
00:56:22,063 --> 00:56:23,939
Thanks for the advice.

479
00:56:24,023 --> 00:56:25,941
Sorry to waste your time.

480
00:56:26,025 --> 00:56:27,943
No problem at all.

481
00:56:28,027 --> 00:56:30,487
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you.

482
00:56:44,794 --> 00:56:47,129
Oh, for the love of -

483
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:53,093
- 8-Lincoln-30 to Dispatch.
- 8-L-30, go ahead.

484
00:56:53,177 --> 00:56:55,720
Yeah, that's a wild goose chase
over here at Nakatomi Plaza.

485
00:56:55,805 --> 00:56:58,682
Everything here's okay.
Over.

486
00:57:07,483 --> 00:57:10,193
Damn! Goddamn it!
Jesus H. Christ!

487
00:57:16,826 --> 00:57:18,994
Welcome to the party, pal!

488
00:57:19,078 --> 00:57:20,871
Goddamn it!

489
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:29,838
Now means now, goddamn it!

490
00:57:29,922 --> 00:57:32,048
Policeman under automatic
rifle fire at Nakatomi!

491
00:57:32,133 --> 00:57:34,134
I need backup assistance now!

492
00:57:34,218 --> 00:57:36,845
Now, goddamn it! Now!

493
00:57:55,281 --> 00:57:57,949
Monica, I can get us a table.

494
00:57:58,034 --> 00:57:59,951
Wolfgang and l
are very close friends.

495
00:58:00,036 --> 00:58:01,953
Officer in need of assistance.

496
00:58:02,038 --> 00:58:04,080
- l interviewed him.
- Reports of shots fired at Nakatomi.

497
00:58:04,165 --> 00:58:06,082
2000 block, Avenue of the Stars.

498
00:58:06,167 --> 00:58:08,293
Repeat, officer
needs assistance at -

499
00:58:08,377 --> 00:58:11,546
I'm in Nakatomi Plaza.
They're turning my car into Swiss cheese!

500
00:58:11,631 --> 00:58:15,717
I need backup assistance now!
Now, goddamn it! Now!

501
00:58:36,739 --> 00:58:38,657
I never thought I'd love
to hear that sound.

502
00:58:38,783 --> 00:58:43,328
All of you, relax. This is a matter
of inconvenient timing, that's all.

503
00:58:43,412 --> 00:58:45,497
Police action was inevitable...

504
00:58:45,581 --> 00:58:48,375
and, as it happens, necessary.

505
00:58:48,459 --> 00:58:52,003
So let them
fumble about outside, and stay calm.

506
00:58:52,088 --> 00:58:54,172
This is simply the beginning.

507
00:58:54,257 --> 00:58:58,593
I thought I told all of you
I want radio silence until further-

508
00:58:58,678 --> 00:59:01,346
Oh, I'm very sorry, Hans.
I didn't get that message.

509
00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:04,808
Maybe you should have
put it on the bulletin board.

510
00:59:04,892 --> 00:59:07,310
I figured since I waxed Tony and Marco
and his friend here...

511
00:59:07,395 --> 00:59:10,188
I figured you and Karl and Franco
might be a little lonely.

512
00:59:10,273 --> 00:59:12,357
So I wanted to give you a call.

513
00:59:12,441 --> 00:59:14,442
How does he know so much about -

514
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,572
That's very kind of you.

515
00:59:18,656 --> 00:59:22,450
I assume you are
our mysterious party crasher.

516
00:59:22,535 --> 00:59:25,912
You are most troublesome
for a security guard.

517
00:59:25,997 --> 00:59:28,832
Sorry, Hans. Wrong guess.

518
00:59:28,916 --> 00:59:33,086
Would you like to go for "Double Jeopardy"
where the scores can really change?

519
00:59:37,008 --> 00:59:39,134
Hmm. These are very bad for you.

520
00:59:39,218 --> 00:59:41,553
Who are you then?

521
00:59:41,637 --> 00:59:45,390
Just a fly in the ointment, Hans.
A monkey in the wrench.

522
00:59:45,474 --> 00:59:48,018
A pain in the ass.

523
00:59:49,562 --> 00:59:52,522
Whoa.

524
00:59:52,607 --> 00:59:55,066
Check on all the others.
Don't use the radio.

525
00:59:55,151 --> 00:59:59,321
See if he's lying about Marco,
and find out if anyone else is missing.

526
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:05,035
Mr. Mystery Guest...

527
01:00:06,454 --> 01:00:08,580
are you still there?

528
01:00:08,664 --> 01:00:13,084
Yeah, I'm still here.
Unless you wanna open the front door for me.

529
01:00:13,169 --> 01:00:15,086
No, I'm afraid not.

530
01:00:15,171 --> 01:00:17,797
But you have me at a loss.

531
01:00:17,882 --> 01:00:19,799
You know my name, but who are you?

532
01:00:19,884 --> 01:00:24,888
Just another American who saw
too many movies as a child?

533
01:00:24,972 --> 01:00:28,975
Another orphan of a bankrupt culture
who thinks he's John Wayne?

534
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:31,853
Rambo? Marshal Dillon?

535
01:00:31,937 --> 01:00:35,106
I was always kind of partial
to Roy Rogers actually.

536
01:00:35,191 --> 01:00:37,108
I really liked those sequin shirts.

537
01:00:37,193 --> 01:00:40,403
Do you really think you have
a chance against us, Mr. Cowboy?

538
01:00:42,823 --> 01:00:45,909
Yippee-ki-yea, motherfucker.

539
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:52,624
- I can get the jump on everybody if I get a remote.
- I don't have the new pages.

540
01:00:52,708 --> 01:00:56,169
- Where's the Gladden report?
- Harvey, keep your pants on, will you?

541
01:00:56,253 --> 01:00:59,673
- Sam, look, I'm begging you.
- Simon's at a remote thing
with that Santa sing-along.

542
01:00:59,757 --> 01:01:02,425
- I'll tell him to swing by.
- I'm not sitting on this for Simon!

543
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:04,427
- I don't wanna hear it!
- This is my story!

544
01:01:04,512 --> 01:01:06,930
- I can't hear you.
- All right, look. Sam, I tell you what.

545
01:01:07,014 --> 01:01:09,849
You don't wanna give me a truck,
I'll go and I'll steal a truck.

546
01:01:09,934 --> 01:01:12,435
- Give us a break, Thornburg.
- Eat it, Harvey!

547
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:16,523
Four, three, two, one.

548
01:01:16,607 --> 01:01:19,109
Harvey, we're on the air.

549
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:24,739
Good evening.
This is Harvey Johnson.

550
01:01:26,784 --> 01:01:30,662
And I'm Gail Wallens, and this is
Nightline News at 10:00.

551
01:01:30,746 --> 01:01:33,456
Our top stories
on this Christmas Eve-

552
01:01:33,541 --> 01:01:36,376
Take truck number five
and get out of here.

553
01:01:43,592 --> 01:01:47,887
He wasn't lying about Marco.
He's down on the street.

554
01:01:47,972 --> 01:01:50,140
And the other man was Heinrich.

555
01:01:50,224 --> 01:01:52,767
And his bag is missing.

556
01:01:54,437 --> 01:01:56,688
But he had the detonators.

557
01:01:59,567 --> 01:02:01,484
Theo.

558
01:02:02,570 --> 01:02:05,238
- Theo.
- Yo!

559
01:02:05,322 --> 01:02:07,949
We may have some problems.
How's our schedule?

560
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:14,289
- Three down, four to go.
- Then don't waste time talking to me.

561
01:02:14,373 --> 01:02:17,834
This is Sergeant Al Powell
of the Los Angeles Police Department.

562
01:02:17,918 --> 01:02:20,545
if the person who radioed for help
can hear me on this channel...

563
01:02:20,629 --> 01:02:23,673
acknowledge this transmission.

564
01:02:23,758 --> 01:02:27,093
I say again, if the person who radioed for help
on this channel can hear me...

565
01:02:27,178 --> 01:02:29,637
acknowledge this transmission.

566
01:02:34,059 --> 01:02:36,561
I read you, Powell.
You the guy in the car?

567
01:02:36,645 --> 01:02:38,605
What's left of him.

568
01:02:38,689 --> 01:02:42,650
- Can you identify yourself?
- Not now. Maybe later.

569
01:02:42,735 --> 01:02:46,362
Listen fast. This is a party line,
and the neighbors got itchy trigger fingers.

570
01:02:46,447 --> 01:02:49,866
All right, here's the deal.
You got 30 or so hostages on the 30th floor.

571
01:02:49,950 --> 01:02:53,411
- The leader, his name is Hans.
- We have to find him and shut him up.

572
01:02:53,496 --> 01:02:56,122
- He's telling them everything!
- Let him. I'm waiting for the F.B.I. to arrive.

573
01:02:56,207 --> 01:03:01,002
Until then, he can waste as much time as he likes,
but we must find the bag.

574
01:03:01,086 --> 01:03:04,380
- Fritz, go help Uli. We must have the detonators.
- They got an arsenal up here.

575
01:03:04,465 --> 01:03:07,008
They got missiles, automatic weapons...

576
01:03:07,092 --> 01:03:09,093
and enough plastic explosives
to orbit Arnold Schwarzenegger.

577
01:03:09,178 --> 01:03:13,014
They're down to nine now,
countin' the skydiver you met.

578
01:03:13,098 --> 01:03:17,101
These guys are mostly European,
judging by their clothing labels and...

579
01:03:23,818 --> 01:03:25,735
cigarettes.

580
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:27,987
They're well-financed
and very slick.

581
01:03:28,072 --> 01:03:31,574
- How do you know that?
- I've seen enough phony I.D.'s in my time...

582
01:03:31,659 --> 01:03:34,828
to recognize that the ones they got
must've cost a fortune.

583
01:03:37,832 --> 01:03:40,291
Add all that up, l don't know
what the fuck it means.

584
01:03:40,376 --> 01:03:43,878
But you got some badass perpetrators,
and they're here to stay.

585
01:03:45,631 --> 01:03:48,383
I hear you, partner.
L.A.'s finest are on it.

586
01:03:48,467 --> 01:03:52,220
- So light 'em if you got 'em.
- Way ahead of you, partner.

587
01:03:53,973 --> 01:03:55,974
So what do I call you?

588
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:01,312
Call me... Roy.

589
01:04:01,397 --> 01:04:03,314
Well, listen up, Roy.

590
01:04:03,399 --> 01:04:06,609
if you think of anything else
you think we need to know, don't be shy, okay?

591
01:04:06,694 --> 01:04:09,487
In the meantime, find a safe place to hole up
and let us do our job.

592
01:04:09,572 --> 01:04:12,615
- Understand?
- They're all yours, Al.

593
01:04:30,384 --> 01:04:32,844
All right, who's talking to 'em?

594
01:04:32,928 --> 01:04:36,556
I am, sir.
Sergeant Powell. Al Powell.

595
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:40,101
Dwayne Robinson, Powell.
What's the deal here? What do these pricks want?

596
01:04:40,185 --> 01:04:42,937
Well, if you mean the terrorists, sir,
we don't exactly know.

597
01:04:43,022 --> 01:04:44,939
We haven't heard a peep from them.

598
01:04:45,024 --> 01:04:47,650
Well, who in the hell
have you been talking to?

599
01:04:47,735 --> 01:04:50,612
We don't know that either, sir.
He won't give us his name.

600
01:04:50,696 --> 01:04:53,114
But he appears to be the one
who phoned in the report.

601
01:04:53,198 --> 01:04:56,534
He's killed one terrorist for sure,
and he claims he's capped off two others.

602
01:04:56,619 --> 01:04:58,745
He claims?

603
01:04:58,829 --> 01:05:02,498
Has it occurred to you he could
be one of the terrorists pulling your chain?

604
01:05:02,583 --> 01:05:04,751
Or some nutcase in there?

605
01:05:04,835 --> 01:05:07,503
I don't think so, sir.
In fact, I think he's a cop.

606
01:05:07,588 --> 01:05:11,507
- Maybe not L.A.P.D., but he's definitely a badge.
- How do you know that?

607
01:05:11,592 --> 01:05:14,552
A hunch.
Things he said...

608
01:05:14,637 --> 01:05:17,180
like being able to spot a phony l.D.

609
01:05:17,264 --> 01:05:21,351
Jesus Christ, Powell!
He could be a fucking bartender for all we know.

610
01:05:21,435 --> 01:05:25,521
- TV's here.
- Oh, shit.

611
01:05:35,950 --> 01:05:38,076
I'm not gonna warn you again.

612
01:05:42,081 --> 01:05:43,998
I have a request.

613
01:05:44,083 --> 01:05:48,503
- What idiot put you in charge?
- You did...

614
01:05:48,587 --> 01:05:50,838
when you murdered my boss.

615
01:05:50,923 --> 01:05:52,840
Now everybody's looking to me.

616
01:05:52,925 --> 01:05:58,012
Personally, l'd pass on the job.
I don't enjoy being this close to you.

617
01:06:06,355 --> 01:06:08,272
Go on.

618
01:06:08,357 --> 01:06:10,316
We have a pregnant woman out there.

619
01:06:10,401 --> 01:06:13,319
Relax. She's not due
for a couple of weeks.

620
01:06:13,404 --> 01:06:16,489
But sitting on that rock
isn't doing her back any good.

621
01:06:16,573 --> 01:06:20,034
So I would like permission to move her
to one of the offices where there's a sofa.

622
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:24,789
No, but I'll have a sofa
brought out to you. Good enough?

623
01:06:24,873 --> 01:06:26,833
Good enough.

624
01:06:26,917 --> 01:06:30,253
And unless you like it messy,
I'd start bringing us in groups to the bathroom.

625
01:06:32,464 --> 01:06:36,092
Yes, you're right.
It will be done.

626
01:06:36,176 --> 01:06:38,928
Was there something else?

627
01:06:40,305 --> 01:06:42,265
No. Thank you.

628
01:06:48,647 --> 01:06:51,107
Mr. Takagi chose
his people well, Mrs. -

629
01:06:52,401 --> 01:06:55,069
Gennero.

630
01:06:55,154 --> 01:06:57,989
Miss Gennero.

631
01:07:00,242 --> 01:07:02,660
We interrupt this program
for a special news bulletin.

632
01:07:02,745 --> 01:07:06,748
This is Richard Thornburg,
live from Century City.

633
01:07:06,832 --> 01:07:08,916
Tonight, Los Angeles has joined...

634
01:07:09,001 --> 01:07:11,961
the sad and worldwide
fraternity of cities...

635
01:07:12,046 --> 01:07:13,963
whose only membership requirement...

636
01:07:14,048 --> 01:07:17,216
is to suffer the anguish
of international terrorism.

637
01:07:17,301 --> 01:07:21,679
Approximately two hours ago,
an unidentified group of men...

638
01:07:21,764 --> 01:07:24,307
seized control
of the Nakatomi building...

639
01:07:24,391 --> 01:07:26,726
sealing off all entrances and exits.

640
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:28,770
All telephone lines have been cut.

641
01:07:28,854 --> 01:07:31,147
And the only communication
now possible...

642
01:07:31,231 --> 01:07:34,400
has been through the use
of C.B. communicators...

643
01:07:34,485 --> 01:07:36,611
which the group
apparently brought with them.

644
01:07:36,695 --> 01:07:41,199
According to official sources,
the perpetrators-

645
01:07:41,283 --> 01:07:44,035
Unit Five, hold your
position at the main entrance.

646
01:07:44,161 --> 01:07:48,706
 All right, guys, we got Charlie Unit
in position by the parking structure.

647
01:07:48,791 --> 01:07:52,251
Let me ask you something.
Does this stairway go up to the escalator?

648
01:07:52,336 --> 01:07:54,378
- Yeah. That's where they're going.
- Tell them to go ahead.

649
01:07:54,463 --> 01:07:58,591
- Through the lobby up there
and try and draw some fire.
- What's going on?

650
01:07:58,675 --> 01:08:00,760
What's it look like?
We're going in.

651
01:08:00,844 --> 01:08:03,429
Goin' in?
Man, that's crazy!

652
01:08:03,514 --> 01:08:05,973
There could be over 30 hostages in there
for all we know.

653
01:08:06,058 --> 01:08:08,601
We don't know shit, Powell.
If there's hostages...

654
01:08:08,685 --> 01:08:11,312
how come nobody's come to us
with ransom demands?

655
01:08:11,396 --> 01:08:15,108
If there's terrorists in there,
where's their list of demands?

656
01:08:15,192 --> 01:08:17,276
All we know is that
somebody shot your car up.

657
01:08:17,361 --> 01:08:21,280
It's probably the same silly son of a bitch
you've been talking to on that radio.

658
01:08:21,365 --> 01:08:25,409
Excuse me, sir, but what about the body
that fell out the window?

659
01:08:25,494 --> 01:08:28,454
Well, who knows? It was probably
some stockbroker who got depressed.

660
01:08:28,539 --> 01:08:30,957
- We're ready for you, Chief.
- All right, light 'em up. Let's go.

661
01:08:31,041 --> 01:08:33,459
- All right, hit your lights.
- Blue Unit, go.

662
01:08:33,544 --> 01:08:36,003
- We got approval, Chief.
- Lights on!

663
01:08:37,756 --> 01:08:39,090
Down a little.

664
01:08:47,057 --> 01:08:49,225
Al.

665
01:08:49,309 --> 01:08:51,894
Al, you still with me, babe?
What's going on?

666
01:08:51,979 --> 01:08:53,980
Yo, Al?

667
01:08:54,064 --> 01:08:57,817
I'm here, Roy. I'm kind of busy right now.
I'll talk to you later.

668
01:08:57,901 --> 01:09:00,611
- What's wrong? What's going on?
- I said I'll talk to you later.

669
01:09:00,696 --> 01:09:04,490
If you are what I think you are, then you'll know
when to listen, when to shut up...

670
01:09:04,575 --> 01:09:08,828
and -  and when to pray.

671
01:09:08,912 --> 01:09:11,122
Jesus Christ. You're coming in.
That's it, isn't it?

672
01:09:11,206 --> 01:09:14,709
Christ, Powell, I told you what kind of people
you're dealing with here.

673
01:09:14,793 --> 01:09:17,086
- All right, let's load 'em up.
- Blue, go.

674
01:09:20,090 --> 01:09:22,925
So, they'll be coming.
Everyone get ready.

675
01:09:23,010 --> 01:09:26,762
Theo, you are the eyes now.

676
01:09:38,984 --> 01:09:40,902
- Rivers!
- Yo!

677
01:09:40,986 --> 01:09:43,696
Begin your reconnoiter.

678
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:45,781
Let's go!

679
01:09:47,951 --> 01:09:50,161
Shit!

680
01:10:08,889 --> 01:10:11,390
Hey, come on.
Let's go!

681
01:10:20,901 --> 01:10:22,818
Ow! Jesus.

682
01:10:56,937 --> 01:10:58,938
All right, spread out.

683
01:11:25,257 --> 01:11:28,134
Shut up.

684
01:11:28,218 --> 01:11:30,219
Let's go!

685
01:11:35,142 --> 01:11:37,059
You macho assholes.
No! No!

686
01:11:40,063 --> 01:11:42,857
All right. Listen up, guys.

687
01:11:45,569 --> 01:11:48,863
'Twas the night before Christmas,
and all through the house...

688
01:11:48,947 --> 01:11:51,032
not a creature was stirring,
except...

689
01:11:51,116 --> 01:11:54,076
the four assholes
coming in the rear...

690
01:11:54,161 --> 01:11:55,911
in standard two-by-two
cover formation.

691
01:11:58,707 --> 01:12:01,000
Okay, we're all set.

692
01:12:01,084 --> 01:12:03,419
We're ready.

693
01:12:03,503 --> 01:12:05,629
- Kick ass.
- Go!

694
01:12:05,714 --> 01:12:07,715
Right. Let's do it.

695
01:12:23,357 --> 01:12:26,692
- Take cover!
- They're shootin' at 'em!

696
01:12:26,777 --> 01:12:28,819
It's panic fire.
They can't see anything.

697
01:12:28,904 --> 01:12:30,780
They're shootin' at the lights.

698
01:12:35,494 --> 01:12:38,621
They're going after the lights.
Pull 'em back.

699
01:12:40,165 --> 01:12:42,291
- It's not happening.
- Mike, burn it.

700
01:12:44,544 --> 01:12:46,212
Don't be impatient.

701
01:12:46,296 --> 01:12:50,674
Just wound them.

702
01:12:50,759 --> 01:12:53,219
- Get 'em back. They're sittin' ducks
up there without lights.
- No, they're almost in.

703
01:12:53,303 --> 01:12:56,555
- Get 'em back!
- They're almost in. Send in the car.

704
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,265
Send in the car.

705
01:13:11,613 --> 01:13:14,115
Jesus Christ!

706
01:13:16,118 --> 01:13:18,869
Rivers, Rodriguez, report.

707
01:13:18,954 --> 01:13:21,831
Whoa! Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
What have we here, gentlemen?

708
01:13:25,919 --> 01:13:28,546
The police have themselves an R.V.

709
01:13:33,885 --> 01:13:36,262
Southeast corner.

710
01:13:37,347 --> 01:13:39,765
Hurry ...

711
01:13:48,233 --> 01:13:50,192
Oh, Jesus Christ.

712
01:14:02,122 --> 01:14:04,832
Out of here! Get back!
Get the fuck back!

713
01:14:06,626 --> 01:14:09,712
- Get over there!
- Hurry.

714
01:14:12,052 --> 01:14:16,052
- Shit
- Leave it. Move on.

715
01:14:43,371 --> 01:14:44,914
I see him!

716
01:14:51,171 --> 01:14:52,588
- Ready?
- Just a moment.

717
01:15:04,226 --> 01:15:07,186
Oh, my God!
The quarterback is toast.

718
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:09,355
- All right, all right!
- Get them out of the car. Let's go!

719
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:12,608
- Hang on, Rivers. That's an order.
- Hit it again.

720
01:15:12,692 --> 01:15:15,945
Hans, you motherfucker, you made your point!
Let 'em pull back!

721
01:15:16,029 --> 01:15:18,989
Thank you, Mr. Cowboy.
I'll take it under advisement.

722
01:15:19,115 --> 01:15:20,908
Hit it again.

723
01:15:33,505 --> 01:15:35,631
Fire.

724
01:15:50,230 --> 01:15:52,189
Fuck me.

725
01:15:52,274 --> 01:15:54,817
Let's go! Get 'em out of the car.
Don't you know they're burning?

726
01:16:04,286 --> 01:16:06,704
Fuck it.

727
01:16:06,788 --> 01:16:08,497
Bring the other one over here.
Hurry.

728
01:16:18,174 --> 01:16:21,719
Let's see you take this
under advisement, jerk-weed.

729
01:16:24,681 --> 01:16:27,349
Geronimo, motherfucker!

730
01:16:46,161 --> 01:16:49,413
Oh, shit!

731
01:16:52,042 --> 01:16:54,043
They're using artillery on us!

732
01:16:54,127 --> 01:16:58,505
You idiot.
It's not the police. It's him.

733
01:17:05,347 --> 01:17:07,264
Holy shit.

734
01:17:12,646 --> 01:17:14,730
My God.

735
01:17:16,316 --> 01:17:20,527
- Tell me you got that.
- I got it. I got it.

736
01:17:20,612 --> 01:17:23,072
Eat your heart out, Channel Five.

737
01:17:23,156 --> 01:17:27,117
We've had an update on the
terrorist takeover of the Nakatomi building.

738
01:17:27,202 --> 01:17:31,455
Sources say the terrorist leader, Hans,
may be this man, Hans Gruber...

739
01:17:31,539 --> 01:17:34,917
a member of the radical
West German Volksfrei movement.

740
01:17:35,001 --> 01:17:38,587
Strangely, the Volksfrei leadership
issued a communiqué an hour ago...

741
01:17:38,672 --> 01:17:41,256
stating that Gruber had been
expelled from that organization.

742
01:17:41,341 --> 01:17:45,177
- Al, do you copy?
- Are you all right?

743
01:17:45,261 --> 01:17:48,555
Yeah, I'm fine.

744
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:50,683
What-What was that?

745
01:17:50,767 --> 01:17:52,976
- Remember that plastic explosive I told you about?
- Yeah.

746
01:17:53,061 --> 01:17:55,979
There you go.
Is the building on fire?

747
01:17:56,064 --> 01:18:00,150
No, but it's gonna need a paint job
and a shitload of screen doors.

748
01:18:00,235 --> 01:18:02,194
Our spotters say
you got two with that blast.

749
01:18:02,278 --> 01:18:04,196
Is that him?
Is that him?

750
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:06,198
- Yes, sir.
- Give me that.

751
01:18:06,282 --> 01:18:09,576
You listen to me, mister. l don't know
who in the hell you think you are...

752
01:18:09,661 --> 01:18:11,870
or what you're doing,
but you just destroyed a building!

753
01:18:11,955 --> 01:18:17,042
Now, we do not want your help.
Is that clear? We don't want your help.

754
01:18:17,127 --> 01:18:20,212
I've got 100 people down here,
and they're covered with glass.

755
01:18:20,296 --> 01:18:24,133
Glass? Who gives a shit about glass?
Who the fuck is this?

756
01:18:25,885 --> 01:18:28,345
This is Deputy Chief of Police
Dwayne T. Robinson...

757
01:18:28,430 --> 01:18:30,514
and I am in charge
of this situation.

758
01:18:30,598 --> 01:18:34,476
Oh, you're in charge? Well, l got some
bad news for you, Dwayne.

759
01:18:34,561 --> 01:18:37,813
From up here it doesn't look like
you're in charge of jack shit.

760
01:18:37,897 --> 01:18:40,941
- You listen to me, you little asshole. I'm -
- Asshole?

761
01:18:41,025 --> 01:18:45,112
I'm not the one who just got butt-fucked
on national TV, Dwayne.

762
01:18:45,196 --> 01:18:47,990
Now, you listen to me, jerk-off.

763
01:18:48,074 --> 01:18:50,492
If you're not part of the solution,
you're part of the problem.

764
01:18:50,577 --> 01:18:53,871
Quit being part of the fucking problem
and put the other guy back on!

765
01:18:56,916 --> 01:18:58,834
Hey, Roy.
How you feelin'?

766
01:18:58,918 --> 01:19:01,336
Pretty fuckin' unappreciated, Al.

767
01:19:01,421 --> 01:19:05,632
Hey, look. l love you.
So do a lot of the other guys.

768
01:19:05,717 --> 01:19:10,304
So you hang in there, man.
You hear me? You hang in there.

769
01:19:12,182 --> 01:19:14,683
Yeah, thanks, partner.

770
01:19:19,355 --> 01:19:21,774
What are you doing?

771
01:19:21,858 --> 01:19:25,360
I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see
who gets us killed first -

772
01:19:25,445 --> 01:19:27,362
them or your husband.

773
01:19:27,447 --> 01:19:29,364
What are you going to do?

774
01:19:29,449 --> 01:19:31,658
Hey, babe, I negotiate
million-dollar deals for breakfast.

775
01:19:31,743 --> 01:19:34,661
I think I can handle
this Euro-trash. Hey.

776
01:19:34,746 --> 01:19:37,247
Sprechen sie talk?
Huh?

777
01:19:37,332 --> 01:19:40,125
If you listened to me,
he would be neutralized already.

778
01:19:40,210 --> 01:19:44,046
 I don't want neutral. I want dead.

779
01:19:44,130 --> 01:19:46,465
- Hope I'm not interrupting.
- What does he want?

780
01:19:46,549 --> 01:19:50,219
It's not what I want.
It's what I can give you.

781
01:19:58,061 --> 01:19:59,978
Look, let's be straight, okay?

782
01:20:00,063 --> 01:20:04,691
It's obvious you're not some dumb schmuck
up here to snatch a few purses. Am I right?

783
01:20:04,776 --> 01:20:08,320
- You're very perceptive.
- I watch 60 Minutes.

784
01:20:08,404 --> 01:20:12,115
I say to myself, "These guys are professional,
they're motivated...

785
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:15,118
they're happening,
i.e. they want something."

786
01:20:15,203 --> 01:20:18,038
Now, personally, I couldn't care less
about your politics.

787
01:20:18,122 --> 01:20:20,249
Maybe you're pissed off
at the camel jockeys.

788
01:20:20,333 --> 01:20:23,210
Maybe it's the Hebes, Northern Ireland.
lt's none of my business.

789
01:20:23,294 --> 01:20:25,754
I figure you're here to negotiate.
Am I right?

790
01:20:25,839 --> 01:20:29,383
You're amazing.
You figured this all out already?

791
01:20:29,467 --> 01:20:33,720
Hey, business is business.
You use a gun. I use a fountain pen.

792
01:20:33,805 --> 01:20:36,265
What's the difference?
Let's put it in my terms.

793
01:20:36,349 --> 01:20:38,892
You're here in a hostile takeover,
you grab us for some greenmail...

794
01:20:38,977 --> 01:20:42,271
but you didn't expect some poison pill
was gonna be running around in the building.

795
01:20:42,355 --> 01:20:43,939
Am I right?

796
01:20:44,023 --> 01:20:48,777
Hans, Bubbe, I'm your white knight.

797
01:20:50,613 --> 01:20:53,657
I must have missed 60 Minutes.
What are you saying?

798
01:20:56,286 --> 01:20:59,454
The guy upstairs
who's fucking things up? Huh?

799
01:21:03,793 --> 01:21:05,961
I can give him to you.

800
01:21:08,339 --> 01:21:10,424
Oh, God!

801
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:14,845
Roy!
Roy, you all right?

802
01:21:16,472 --> 01:21:20,684
Just trying to fire down
a thousand-year-old Twinkie

803
01:21:20,768 --> 01:21:23,353
What do they put
in these things, anyway?

804
01:21:23,438 --> 01:21:27,316
Sugar-enriched flour,
partially hydrogenated vegetable oil...

805
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:30,903
polysorbate 60
and yellow dye number five.

806
01:21:30,987 --> 01:21:33,906
Just everything a growing boy needs.

807
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:35,908
How many kids you got, Al?

808
01:21:35,992 --> 01:21:39,995
Well, as a matter of fact,
my wife is working on our first.

809
01:21:40,079 --> 01:21:44,166
How about you, cowboy?
You got any kids back on your ranch?

810
01:21:46,002 --> 01:21:48,712
Yeah. Two.

811
01:21:48,796 --> 01:21:52,925
I sure hope I can see 'em swinging
on a jungle gym with Al Jr. someday.

812
01:21:53,009 --> 01:21:57,429
Well, now, that's a date.

813
01:21:57,513 --> 01:22:00,015
But, uh, you're gonna have
to bring the ice cream.

814
01:22:00,099 --> 01:22:03,101
Touching, cowboy. Touching.

815
01:22:03,186 --> 01:22:07,940
Or should I call you Mr. McClane?

816
01:22:08,024 --> 01:22:10,525
Mr. Officer John McClane...

817
01:22:10,610 --> 01:22:13,070
of the New York Police Department.

818
01:22:14,322 --> 01:22:17,115
- Get on the phone to Harry in New York.
- Got it.

819
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:19,534
Better get ahold
of somebody at Dispatch.

820
01:22:19,619 --> 01:22:24,289
Sister Theresa called me
Mr. McClane in third grade.

821
01:22:24,374 --> 01:22:26,375
My friends call me John.

822
01:22:26,459 --> 01:22:28,543
You're neither, shithead.

823
01:22:30,797 --> 01:22:33,131
l have someone
who wants to talk to you -

824
01:22:33,216 --> 01:22:35,133
a very special friend...

825
01:22:35,218 --> 01:22:37,761
who was with you
at the party tonight.

826
01:22:43,893 --> 01:22:45,894
Hey, John Boy.

827
01:22:47,355 --> 01:22:51,358
- Ellis?
- Yeah. Now, listen, John.

828
01:22:51,442 --> 01:22:54,277
They're givin' me a few minutes
to try to talk some sense into you.

829
01:22:54,362 --> 01:22:57,406
I know you think you're doing your job,
and l can appreciate that...

830
01:22:57,490 --> 01:22:59,574
but you're just
dragging this thing out.

831
01:22:59,659 --> 01:23:02,327
Now, look, no one gets out of here
until these guys...

832
01:23:02,412 --> 01:23:04,329
can talk to the L.A. police...

833
01:23:04,414 --> 01:23:07,582
and that just ain't gonna happen until you stop
messing up the works, capisce?

834
01:23:12,964 --> 01:23:14,923
Ellis, what have you told them?

835
01:23:16,467 --> 01:23:21,596
I told them we were old friends,
and you were my guest at the party.

836
01:23:21,681 --> 01:23:23,598
Ellis, you shouldn't be doing this.

837
01:23:23,683 --> 01:23:26,518
Tell me about it.

838
01:23:31,357 --> 01:23:33,275
All right, John, listen.

839
01:23:33,359 --> 01:23:36,903
They want you to tell them
where the detonators are.

840
01:23:36,988 --> 01:23:39,656
They know people are listening.

841
01:23:39,741 --> 01:23:42,951
They want the detonators
or they're gonna kill me.

842
01:23:45,955 --> 01:23:47,914
John, didn't you hear me?

843
01:23:50,334 --> 01:23:52,252
Yeah, l hear you.

844
01:23:52,336 --> 01:23:54,880
John, I think you could get
with the program a little, huh?

845
01:23:54,964 --> 01:23:56,882
The police are here now.
It's their problem.

846
01:23:56,966 --> 01:23:59,760
Now tell these guys where the detonators
are so no one else gets hurt.

847
01:23:59,844 --> 01:24:02,804
I'm putting my life
on the line for you, pal.

848
01:24:02,889 --> 01:24:05,348
- Ellis, listen to me very carefully.
- John -

849
01:24:05,433 --> 01:24:09,603
Shut up, Ellis! Just shut your mouth!
Put Hans back on the line.

850
01:24:09,687 --> 01:24:14,608
Hans, this shithead does not know
what kind of man you are, but I do. Listen -

851
01:24:14,692 --> 01:24:17,652
Good. Then you'll give us what we want
and save your friend's life.

852
01:24:17,737 --> 01:24:20,322
You're not part of this equation.
It's time you realized that.

853
01:24:20,406 --> 01:24:22,491
Hey, what am l,
a method actor, Hans?

854
01:24:22,575 --> 01:24:26,244
Babe, put away the gun.
This is radio, not television.

855
01:24:26,329 --> 01:24:28,914
Hans, this asshole is not my friend.
l just met him tonight.

856
01:24:28,998 --> 01:24:31,708
I don't know him. Jesus Christ, Ellis,
these people are gonna kill you!

857
01:24:31,793 --> 01:24:34,669
Tell them you don't know me!

858
01:24:34,754 --> 01:24:37,255
John, how can you say that
after all these years?

859
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:41,843
John? John?

860
01:25:03,366 --> 01:25:06,368
Do you hear that?

861
01:25:06,452 --> 01:25:09,287
Talk to me!
Where are my detonators?

862
01:25:09,372 --> 01:25:11,915
Where are they,
or shall I shoot another one?

863
01:25:11,999 --> 01:25:15,544
Sooner or later, I might get to someone
you do care about.

864
01:25:16,587 --> 01:25:18,630
Go fuck yourself, Hans.

865
01:25:20,299 --> 01:25:22,509
Did you hear that?
He just let the guy die, man.

866
01:25:22,593 --> 01:25:25,137
He just gave him up.
Give me that headset.

867
01:25:25,221 --> 01:25:27,139
- That's like pulling the trigger yourself.
- Christ, man.

868
01:25:27,223 --> 01:25:29,891
Can't you see what's happening?
Can't you read between the lines?

869
01:25:29,976 --> 01:25:31,893
- Is this on the right channel?
- Yes, sir.

870
01:25:31,978 --> 01:25:33,937
He did everything he could to save him.

871
01:25:34,021 --> 01:25:36,189
If he gave himself up,
they'd both be dead right now.

872
01:25:36,274 --> 01:25:38,650
No way, man. No way.
They'd be talking to us.

873
01:25:38,734 --> 01:25:42,404
Listen, you tell this partner of yours to stay
the hell out of this from now on.

874
01:25:42,488 --> 01:25:46,491
Because if he doesn't, I'm gonna nail him.
I'm really gonna nail his ass now. Believe me.

875
01:25:46,576 --> 01:25:49,619
The man is hurtin'.
He is alone, tired...

876
01:25:49,704 --> 01:25:52,998
and he hasn't seen diddly-squat
from anybody down here.

877
01:25:53,082 --> 01:25:55,000
Now, you're gonna
stand there and tell me...

878
01:25:55,084 --> 01:25:58,837
he's gonna give a damn about what you'll do
to him if he makes it out of there alive?

879
01:25:58,921 --> 01:26:01,840
Why don't you wake up
and smell what you're shoveling?

880
01:26:01,924 --> 01:26:03,842
You listen to me, Sergeant.

881
01:26:03,926 --> 01:26:07,095
Anytime you wanna go home,
you consider yourself dismissed.

882
01:26:07,180 --> 01:26:10,765
No, sir.
You couldn't drag me away.

883
01:26:10,892 --> 01:26:13,643
Attention, police.

884
01:26:13,728 --> 01:26:15,729
Attention, police.

885
01:26:15,813 --> 01:26:18,940
- This is Sergeant Al Powell -
- Give me that.

886
01:26:19,025 --> 01:26:22,527
This is, uh -  This is, uh,
Deputy Chief Dwayne Robinson. Who is this?

887
01:26:22,612 --> 01:26:25,697
This is Hans Gruber.

888
01:26:25,781 --> 01:26:28,533
I assume you realize the futility
of direct action against me.

889
01:26:28,618 --> 01:26:30,911
We have no wish
for further loss of life.

890
01:26:30,995 --> 01:26:34,039
Well, uh, what is it you do wish for,
Mr. Gruber?

891
01:26:34,123 --> 01:26:38,627
I have comrades-in-arms
around the world languishing in prison.

892
01:26:38,711 --> 01:26:41,963
The American State Department
enjoys rattling its saber for its own ends.

893
01:26:42,048 --> 01:26:45,634
Now it can rattle it for me.

894
01:26:45,718 --> 01:26:50,013
The following people
are to be released from their captors.

895
01:26:50,097 --> 01:26:53,099
ln Northern Ireland,
the seven members of the New Provo Front.

896
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:57,812
In Canada, the five imprisoned leaders
of Liberté de Québec.

897
01:26:57,897 --> 01:27:03,443
- In Sri Lanka, the nine members
of the Asian Dawn movement.
- What the fuck?

898
01:27:05,446 --> 01:27:08,782
I read about them in Time magazine.

899
01:27:08,866 --> 01:27:12,452
When these revolutionary
brothers and sisters are free...

900
01:27:12,536 --> 01:27:15,622
the hostages in this building
will be taken to the roof...

901
01:27:15,706 --> 01:27:20,085
and they will accompany us in helicopters
to the Los Angeles International Airport...

902
01:27:20,169 --> 01:27:22,212
where they will be given
further instructions.

903
01:27:22,296 --> 01:27:24,673
You have two hours to comply.

904
01:27:24,757 --> 01:27:28,260
Wait a minute.
Mr. Gruber, this is crazy.

905
01:27:28,344 --> 01:27:31,846
I-l-I don't have the authority.
I can't authorize - Two hours is not enough.

906
01:27:31,931 --> 01:27:34,099
H-Hello?

907
01:27:34,183 --> 01:27:36,351
Hello?

908
01:27:36,435 --> 01:27:39,688
Danny, did you get all that?
Let's go. We gotta make some calls.

909
01:27:39,772 --> 01:27:41,898
Do you think they'll
even try to do it?

910
01:27:41,983 --> 01:27:44,109
Who cares?

911
01:27:46,654 --> 01:27:48,571
Theo, are we on schedule?

912
01:27:48,656 --> 01:27:51,658
One more to go, then it's up to you.
And you better be right...

913
01:27:51,742 --> 01:27:54,119
because it looks like
this last one's gonna take a miracle.

914
01:27:54,203 --> 01:27:57,205
It's Christmas, Theo.
It's the time of miracles.

915
01:27:57,290 --> 01:28:02,085
So be of good cheer and call me
when you hit the last lock.

916
01:28:02,169 --> 01:28:06,756
Karl, hunt that little shit down
and get those detonators.

917
01:28:06,841 --> 01:28:08,925
Fritz is checking the explosives.

918
01:28:09,010 --> 01:28:11,720
I'll check the explosives.
You just get the detonators.

919
01:28:11,804 --> 01:28:14,139
Hey, Powell, you out there?

920
01:28:14,223 --> 01:28:17,350
I'm here, John.
I'm here.

921
01:28:17,435 --> 01:28:20,937
You gotta believe me.
There was nothing I could do.

922
01:28:22,398 --> 01:28:25,025
Well, it's gonna be both
our asses if you're wrong.

923
01:28:25,109 --> 01:28:27,319
I hear you.

924
01:28:32,992 --> 01:28:35,035
Did you catch that bullshit
Hans was running?

925
01:28:36,412 --> 01:28:38,997
It doesn't make sense, man.

926
01:28:39,081 --> 01:28:42,959
Don't ask me, man. I'm just a desk jockey
who was on my way home when you rang.

927
01:28:43,044 --> 01:28:46,588
The way you drove that car,
I figured you for the street, Al.

928
01:28:46,672 --> 01:28:49,758
In my youth.
In my youth.

929
01:28:49,884 --> 01:28:55,013
And author of Hostage Terrorist,
Terrorist Hostage: A Study in Duality.

930
01:28:55,097 --> 01:28:58,475
Dr. Hasseldorf, what can we expect
in the next few hours?

931
01:28:58,559 --> 01:29:02,103
Well, Gail, by this time the hostages
should be going through...

932
01:29:02,188 --> 01:29:04,647
the early stages
of the "Helsinki Syndrome."

933
01:29:04,732 --> 01:29:08,109
- As in Helsinki, Sweden.
- Finland.

934
01:29:08,194 --> 01:29:12,155
Basically, it's when the hostages
and the terrorists go through...

935
01:29:12,239 --> 01:29:16,743
a sort of psychological transference
and a projection of dependency.

936
01:29:16,827 --> 01:29:19,954
A strange sort of trust
and bond develops.

937
01:29:20,039 --> 01:29:22,290
We've had situations
where the hostages...

938
01:29:22,375 --> 01:29:24,834
have embraced their captors
after their release...

939
01:29:24,919 --> 01:29:27,170
and even corresponded
with them in prison.

940
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:29,756
No, no.
No, darling. "Asian Dawn."

941
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:33,468
Dawn.
D-A-W-N.

942
01:29:33,552 --> 01:29:35,470
- Sir?
- I -  Yeah?

943
01:29:35,554 --> 01:29:38,390
- The F.B.I. is here.
- Oh. The F.B.I. is here now?

944
01:29:38,474 --> 01:29:40,392
Yes, sir, right over there.

945
01:29:40,476 --> 01:29:43,812
- Hold this.
- You want a breath mint?

946
01:29:46,190 --> 01:29:48,441
Uh, yeah. We got it.

947
01:29:48,526 --> 01:29:51,069
Hey!
How you doing, man?

948
01:29:51,153 --> 01:29:53,613
I'm Agent Johnson.
This is Special Agent Johnson.

949
01:29:53,697 --> 01:29:56,908
- Oh. How you doing?
- No relation.

950
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:59,786
I'm, uh -

951
01:29:59,870 --> 01:30:03,665
I'm Dwayne Robinson, L.A.P.D.
I'm in charge here.

952
01:30:03,749 --> 01:30:05,750
Not anymore.

953
01:30:59,889 --> 01:31:04,017
Hi, there.
How you doing?

954
01:31:07,521 --> 01:31:09,981
Oh!

955
01:31:10,065 --> 01:31:15,111
Please, God, no. You're one of them,
aren't you? You're one of them.

956
01:31:15,196 --> 01:31:17,739
Don't -  Don't kill me.
Please, don't. Please!

957
01:31:17,823 --> 01:31:20,492
- Don't kill me. Don't kill me, please.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

958
01:31:20,576 --> 01:31:24,913
Relax. Relax. I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm not gonna hurt you!

959
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:29,709
Oh, God.

960
01:31:32,755 --> 01:31:35,840
What the fuck are you doing up here?
What were you looking for?

961
01:31:35,925 --> 01:31:39,552
I managed to get out of there,
and, uh -

962
01:31:39,637 --> 01:31:41,846
Well, I was just trying
to get up on the roof...

963
01:31:41,931 --> 01:31:45,808
and see if l could
signal for help, you know.

964
01:31:45,893 --> 01:31:47,894
It's just through here.
Why don't you come and help -

965
01:31:47,978 --> 01:31:51,606
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Forget the roof.
- Come on. Come on.

966
01:31:51,690 --> 01:31:56,110
I said forget the roof.
They got people all over it.

967
01:31:56,195 --> 01:31:58,446
Come on. You wanna stay alive,
you stay with me.

968
01:32:01,367 --> 01:32:03,660
Well, the best way
we can figure it is...

969
01:32:03,744 --> 01:32:07,080
we've got maybe
30 or 35 hostages up there...

970
01:32:07,164 --> 01:32:09,082
probably on the 30th floor...

971
01:32:09,166 --> 01:32:12,710
and maybe, l don't know,
seven or eight terrorists up there.

972
01:32:12,795 --> 01:32:15,088
Sounds like an A-7 scenario.

973
01:32:15,172 --> 01:32:17,173
Thank you.
We'll handle it from here.

974
01:32:17,258 --> 01:32:20,552
When we commandeer your men,
we'll try and let you know.

975
01:32:20,636 --> 01:32:23,263
- Aren't you forgetting something?
- Such as?

976
01:32:23,347 --> 01:32:25,265
What about John McClane?

977
01:32:25,349 --> 01:32:28,476
He's the reason why we have
the information we have up until now.

978
01:32:28,561 --> 01:32:32,188
He's also the reason why you're facing
seven terrorists instead of 12.

979
01:32:32,273 --> 01:32:34,607
He's inside?
Who is he?

980
01:32:34,692 --> 01:32:37,569
Well, he might be a cop.
I don't know. We're checking on that.

981
01:32:37,653 --> 01:32:40,321
- One of yours?
- No. No way.

982
01:32:44,326 --> 01:32:46,786
Do you smoke?

983
01:32:47,871 --> 01:32:49,831
Yeah.

984
01:32:54,628 --> 01:32:56,629
Thanks.

985
01:33:00,426 --> 01:33:03,469
You don't work for Nakatomi.

986
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:08,558
And if you're not
one of them -

987
01:33:11,270 --> 01:33:13,187
I'm a cop from New York.

988
01:33:14,773 --> 01:33:16,691
New York?

989
01:33:16,775 --> 01:33:18,776
Yeah.

990
01:33:18,861 --> 01:33:22,989
Got invited to the Christmas party by mistake.
Who knew?

991
01:33:28,912 --> 01:33:31,706
Yeah.

992
01:33:31,790 --> 01:33:34,667
It's better than being caught
with your pants down, huh?

993
01:33:41,884 --> 01:33:44,385
I'm John McClane.

994
01:33:46,013 --> 01:33:47,513
You're, uh -

995
01:33:48,724 --> 01:33:51,559
Clay.

996
01:33:51,644 --> 01:33:53,561
Bill Clay.

997
01:33:59,735 --> 01:34:01,778
You know how to use a handgun, Bill?

998
01:34:03,238 --> 01:34:05,156
I spent a weekend at a combat ranch.

999
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:07,575
You know that game
with the guns that shoot red paint?

1000
01:34:07,660 --> 01:34:10,787
Probably seems
kind of stupid to you.

1001
01:34:11,789 --> 01:34:13,790
Well...

1002
01:34:15,501 --> 01:34:17,418
time for the real thing, Bill.

1003
01:34:26,011 --> 01:34:29,555
All you gotta do
is pull the trigger. Come on.

1004
01:34:38,273 --> 01:34:40,441
33rd. floor. Come right away.

1005
01:34:48,992 --> 01:34:51,077
Put down the gun...

1006
01:34:51,161 --> 01:34:53,287
and give me my detonators.

1007
01:34:57,793 --> 01:35:02,088
Well, well, well.
Hans.

1008
01:35:02,172 --> 01:35:05,675
Put it down now.

1009
01:35:09,596 --> 01:35:13,057
That's pretty tricky
with that accent.

1010
01:35:13,142 --> 01:35:15,351
You oughta be on fucking TV
with that accent.

1011
01:35:18,355 --> 01:35:22,024
But what do you want
with the detonators, Hans?

1012
01:35:22,109 --> 01:35:26,404
I already used all the explosives.

1013
01:35:26,488 --> 01:35:28,448
Or did I?

1014
01:35:30,159 --> 01:35:32,160
- I'm going to count to three.
- Yeah.

1015
01:35:32,244 --> 01:35:34,829
Like you did with Takagi?

1016
01:35:34,913 --> 01:35:37,665
Oops.

1017
01:35:37,750 --> 01:35:41,169
No bullets. You think
I'm fucking stupid, Hans?

1018
01:35:41,253 --> 01:35:43,379
You were saying?

1019
01:36:36,517 --> 01:36:39,477
Karl.

1020
01:36:39,561 --> 01:36:43,397
Shoot the Windows!

1021
01:36:47,486 --> 01:36:50,238
Shoot the glass.

1022
01:37:23,814 --> 01:37:25,773
Jesus Christ!

1023
01:37:54,511 --> 01:37:57,305
Smile, Karl.
We're back in business.

1024
01:38:00,017 --> 01:38:03,436
...is the last resort of diplomacy.

1025
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:06,272
Then couldn't we just as well say...

1026
01:38:06,356 --> 01:38:09,108
that terrorism has an equal claim
on being that too?

1027
01:38:09,192 --> 01:38:11,986
You got something.
Tell me you got something.

1028
01:38:12,070 --> 01:38:14,864
Just McClane's name, badge number,
employment record...

1029
01:38:14,948 --> 01:38:17,533
vital statistics
and his family's home address...

1030
01:38:17,618 --> 01:38:20,077
right here in L.A.

1031
01:38:20,162 --> 01:38:22,705
Whoa!

1032
01:38:27,836 --> 01:38:29,629
Go to work.

1033
01:38:29,713 --> 01:38:31,714
Got it.

1034
01:38:43,769 --> 01:38:47,605
God, that man looks really pissed.

1035
01:38:49,149 --> 01:38:53,819
- He's still alive.
- What?

1036
01:38:53,904 --> 01:38:57,907
Only John can drive
somebody that crazy.

1037
01:39:12,798 --> 01:39:15,466
Hans.

1038
01:39:15,550 --> 01:39:18,094
You better heat up that miracle,
because we just broke through on number six...

1039
01:39:18,178 --> 01:39:20,888
and the electromagnetic
came down like a fucking anvil.

1040
01:39:20,973 --> 01:39:26,268
Have a look at what our friends outside
are doing, and I'll be right up.

1041
01:39:28,730 --> 01:39:32,149
Hey, John?
John McClane, you still with us?

1042
01:39:32,234 --> 01:39:34,151
Yeah.

1043
01:39:34,236 --> 01:39:37,822
But all things being equal,
I'd rather be in Philadelphia.

1044
01:39:38,907 --> 01:39:41,534
Chalk up two more bad guys.

1045
01:39:41,618 --> 01:39:44,120
Well, the boys down here
will be glad to hear that.

1046
01:39:45,247 --> 01:39:47,415
You know, we got
a pool going on you.

1047
01:39:47,499 --> 01:39:50,751
- What kind of odds am I gettin'?
- You don't want to know.

1048
01:39:50,836 --> 01:39:54,463
Put me down for 20.
I'm good for it.

1049
01:39:57,259 --> 01:40:00,469
Hey, Powell, you got flat feet?

1050
01:40:02,597 --> 01:40:04,598
What the hell
you talking about, man?

1051
01:40:04,683 --> 01:40:07,601
Something had to
get you off the street.

1052
01:40:07,686 --> 01:40:10,187
What's the matter? You don't think
jockeying papers across a desk...

1053
01:40:10,272 --> 01:40:12,773
is a noble effort for a cop?

1054
01:40:14,234 --> 01:40:16,235
No.

1055
01:40:18,739 --> 01:40:22,616
- I had an accident.
- The way you drive, I can see why.

1056
01:40:22,701 --> 01:40:26,287
What'd you do, run over
your captain's foot with a car?

1057
01:40:29,416 --> 01:40:31,333
I shot a kid.

1058
01:40:33,128 --> 01:40:36,547
He was 13 years old.

1059
01:40:36,631 --> 01:40:39,050
It was dark. I couldn't see him.
He had a ray gun.

1060
01:40:39,134 --> 01:40:41,135
It looked real enough.

1061
01:40:43,472 --> 01:40:46,515
You know, when you're a rookie, they can
teach you everything about being a cop...

1062
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:49,018
except how to live with a mistake.

1063
01:40:53,148 --> 01:40:57,234
Anyway, I just couldn't bring myself
to draw my gun on anybody again.

1064
01:41:00,989 --> 01:41:03,741
Sorry, man.

1065
01:41:03,825 --> 01:41:06,452
Hey, man, how could you know?

1066
01:41:08,830 --> 01:41:11,665
I feel like shit anyway.

1067
01:41:13,293 --> 01:41:15,211
Well, then this won't matter.

1068
01:41:15,295 --> 01:41:20,007
The L.A.P.D. is not calling
the shots down here anymore.

1069
01:41:22,511 --> 01:41:25,304
- Feds?
- You got it.

1070
01:41:26,848 --> 01:41:29,809
All right, those
are the city engineers.

1071
01:41:31,937 --> 01:41:33,854
They're going into
the street circuits.

1072
01:41:33,939 --> 01:41:37,983
- Those guys in the suits -
I don't know who they are.
- That's the F.B.I.

1073
01:41:39,361 --> 01:41:42,446
They're ordering the others
to cut the building's power.

1074
01:41:42,531 --> 01:41:44,532
Regular as clockwork.

1075
01:41:46,243 --> 01:41:50,246
- Or a time lock.
- Precisely.

1076
01:41:50,330 --> 01:41:54,291
The circuits that cannot be cut
are cut automatically...

1077
01:41:54,376 --> 01:41:57,169
in response to a terrorist incident.

1078
01:41:57,254 --> 01:41:59,964
You asked for miracles, Theo.
I give you...

1079
01:42:00,048 --> 01:42:03,467
the F.B.I.

1080
01:42:03,552 --> 01:42:07,054
- I said I want the friggin' building shut down.
- I got a problem.

1081
01:42:07,139 --> 01:42:09,974
- I got a switch here -
- I don't give two shits about your switch!

1082
01:42:10,058 --> 01:42:13,102
- I want the building out. Dark. D-A-R-K!
- Hold on! You don't understand.

1083
01:42:13,186 --> 01:42:15,104
- You can't do it from here.
- Yeah, you could.

1084
01:42:15,188 --> 01:42:16,814
It can't be done from here.

1085
01:42:16,898 --> 01:42:19,942
- I could just - I got the radio.
- You can't do it from down here I'm telling you.

1086
01:42:20,026 --> 01:42:22,236
It's gotta be done from downtown.

1087
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:24,238
They've gotta take out
a whole city grid.

1088
01:42:24,322 --> 01:42:26,782
- We're talking 10 square blocks.
- Ten blocks?

1089
01:42:26,867 --> 01:42:28,784
Johnson, that's crazy.
It's Christmas Eve, man.

1090
01:42:28,869 --> 01:42:32,413
- There's thousands of people.
- You have to go wider.

1091
01:42:32,497 --> 01:42:34,415
- I need authorization.
- Authorization?

1092
01:42:34,499 --> 01:42:37,293
- How about the United States
fucking government?
- Hey.

1093
01:42:37,377 --> 01:42:39,753
Lose the grid or you lose your job.

1094
01:42:46,094 --> 01:42:48,012
- Yeah, Central?
- Yeah?

1095
01:42:48,096 --> 01:42:51,557
This is Walt down at Nakatomi.
Say, listen.

1096
01:42:51,641 --> 01:42:55,519
Would it be possible
for you to turn off grid 212?

1097
01:42:55,604 --> 01:42:59,106
- Are you crazy?
- Maybe I should call the mayor.

1098
01:42:59,191 --> 01:43:02,193
No shit, it's my ass. I got a big problem
down here. Shut it down.

1099
01:43:02,277 --> 01:43:04,737
Shut it down now.

1100
01:43:07,407 --> 01:43:10,951
Emergency lighting activated.

1101
01:43:11,036 --> 01:43:15,331
- Powell. Powell, talk to me.
What's going on here?
- Ask the F.B.I.

1102
01:43:15,415 --> 01:43:18,167
They got the universal
terrorist playbook...

1103
01:43:18,251 --> 01:43:20,628
and they're running it step by step.

1104
01:43:22,797 --> 01:43:24,715
It's gonna go.
It's gonna go!

1105
01:43:24,799 --> 01:43:27,927
Yes!

1106
01:43:50,700 --> 01:43:52,701
Merry Christmas.

1107
01:43:54,829 --> 01:43:56,872
Those bastards are probably
pissing in their pants right now.

1108
01:43:56,957 --> 01:43:58,874
The mayor's gonna have my ass.

1109
01:44:06,132 --> 01:44:08,133
Whoo!

1110
01:44:20,230 --> 01:44:23,482
Well, what are we gonna do now?

1111
01:44:23,566 --> 01:44:25,985
Arrest them for not
paying their electric bill?

1112
01:44:26,069 --> 01:44:30,948
We've shut them down. We let 'em sweat
for a while, then we give 'em helicopters.

1113
01:44:31,032 --> 01:44:33,033
Right up the ass.

1114
01:44:36,079 --> 01:44:39,290
This is Agent Johnson.
No, the other one.

1115
01:44:39,374 --> 01:44:42,459
I want that air support
ready to lift off in five minutes.

1116
01:44:42,544 --> 01:44:45,754
Damn right. Fully armed.
We're on the way.

1117
01:44:50,051 --> 01:44:53,554
Oh, yeah!

1118
01:44:55,557 --> 01:44:57,725
I wish to talk to the F.B.I.

1119
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:02,438
This is Special Agent Johnson
of the F.B.I.

1120
01:45:02,522 --> 01:45:06,984
The State Department has arranged
for the return of your comrades.

1121
01:45:07,068 --> 01:45:09,778
Helicopters are en route
as you requested.

1122
01:45:09,863 --> 01:45:11,780
I hear you.
We'll be ready.

1123
01:45:11,865 --> 01:45:14,533
By the time he figures out
what hit him, he'll be in a body bag.

1124
01:45:14,617 --> 01:45:16,618
When they touch down,
we'll blow the roof.

1125
01:45:16,703 --> 01:45:18,662
They'll spend a month
sifting through the rubble.

1126
01:45:18,747 --> 01:45:21,165
And by the time they figure out
what went wrong...

1127
01:45:21,249 --> 01:45:24,585
we'll be sitting on a beach
earning 20%.

1128
01:45:29,466 --> 01:45:32,676
Powell.

1129
01:45:32,761 --> 01:45:34,762
Yo, Powell, you got a minute?

1130
01:45:36,264 --> 01:45:38,223
I'm here, John.

1131
01:45:40,143 --> 01:45:43,562
Listen, man, I'm starting
to get a bad feeling up here.

1132
01:45:43,646 --> 01:45:45,814
I want you to do something for me.

1133
01:45:45,899 --> 01:45:48,484
Um -

1134
01:45:48,568 --> 01:45:52,696
I want you to find my wife.
Don't ask me how. By then, you'll know how.

1135
01:45:52,781 --> 01:45:57,242
Uh, I want you
to tell her something.

1136
01:45:57,327 --> 01:45:59,787
I want you to tell her that...

1137
01:45:59,871 --> 01:46:01,872
um -

1138
01:46:06,127 --> 01:46:09,213
Tell her it took me
a while to figure out...

1139
01:46:09,297 --> 01:46:13,008
what a jerk I've been,
but, um -

1140
01:46:14,302 --> 01:46:16,303
but that -

1141
01:46:19,474 --> 01:46:22,017
that when things
started to pan out for her...

1142
01:46:22,102 --> 01:46:27,356
I should've been
more supportive, and, uh -

1143
01:46:28,942 --> 01:46:31,402
and I just should've been
behind her more.

1144
01:46:33,488 --> 01:46:36,323
Oh, shit.

1145
01:46:38,827 --> 01:46:42,037
Tell her that, um -

1146
01:46:42,122 --> 01:46:46,041
that she's the best thing that
ever happened to a bum like me.

1147
01:46:48,169 --> 01:46:51,672
She's heard me say "I love you"
a thousand times.

1148
01:46:53,174 --> 01:46:55,342
She never heard me say, "I'm sorry."

1149
01:46:56,928 --> 01:47:00,764
And I want you to tell her that.
I want you to tell her that...

1150
01:47:00,849 --> 01:47:04,268
John said that he was sorry.

1151
01:47:04,352 --> 01:47:06,478
Okay?

1152
01:47:06,563 --> 01:47:09,857
- You got that, man?
- Yeah, I got it, John.

1153
01:47:11,192 --> 01:47:14,111
But you can tell her that yourself.

1154
01:47:14,195 --> 01:47:18,282
You just watch your ass
and you'll make it out of there. You hear me?

1155
01:47:18,366 --> 01:47:20,576
Well, I guess that's up
to the man upstairs.

1156
01:47:24,372 --> 01:47:28,250
John? John?

1157
01:47:28,334 --> 01:47:31,003
What the fuck were
you doing upstairs, Hans?

1158
01:47:33,548 --> 01:47:37,676
- John?
- No, Al, listen. Listen, just lay off for a while.

1159
01:47:39,721 --> 01:47:41,722
I gotta go check on something.

1160
01:47:45,059 --> 01:47:47,728
One minute.
That's all I'm asking.

1161
01:47:47,812 --> 01:47:50,481
One minute just to speak to you.
All right. All right.

1162
01:47:50,565 --> 01:47:54,026
All right. Get back.
Get back. Off. Off. All right.

1163
01:47:54,110 --> 01:47:57,321
Look, you let me in right now,
or I call the I.N.S.

1164
01:47:57,405 --> 01:48:00,032
Comprende?

1165
01:48:00,116 --> 01:48:05,204
Look, this is the last time these kids are gonna
have to speak to their parents.

1166
01:48:07,332 --> 01:48:10,918
All right? All right.
Come on. Come on.

1167
01:48:21,638 --> 01:48:25,182
What were you doing, Hans?
What were you doing?

1168
01:48:47,455 --> 01:48:50,249
Jesus, Mary, mother of God.

1169
01:48:53,878 --> 01:48:56,046
Powell, listen to me!
It's a double cross!

1170
01:48:56,130 --> 01:48:58,465
The whole roof
of the building's wired to -

1171
01:49:01,177 --> 01:49:03,178
John.

1172
01:49:04,222 --> 01:49:06,139
John.

1173
01:49:06,224 --> 01:49:09,059
John, come in.
Did you get that?

1174
01:49:09,143 --> 01:49:11,645
No. Something about a double cross.

1175
01:49:12,647 --> 01:49:14,606
Tell me about it.

1176
01:49:20,446 --> 01:49:22,531
We are both professionals.

1177
01:49:24,867 --> 01:49:27,744
This is personal.

1178
01:49:27,829 --> 01:49:30,205
Oh.

1179
01:49:50,018 --> 01:49:53,020
They're coming.

1180
01:49:53,104 --> 01:49:55,022
- Choppers are coming.
- Okay.

1181
01:49:55,106 --> 01:49:59,026
Time to gather your flock,
Miss Gennero.

1182
01:49:59,110 --> 01:50:01,445
You know, your mom
and dad are very important people.

1183
01:50:01,529 --> 01:50:04,781
They're very brave people.

1184
01:50:04,866 --> 01:50:08,160
So is there something you would like
to say to them if they're watching?

1185
01:50:09,245 --> 01:50:11,747
Come home.

1186
01:50:18,713 --> 01:50:21,548
Mrs. McClane.

1187
01:50:25,053 --> 01:50:28,764
How nice to make your acquaintance.

1188
01:50:31,726 --> 01:50:33,644
On your feet, everyone!
To the roof!

1189
01:50:33,728 --> 01:50:36,521
Lock them up there
and come right back.

1190
01:50:38,441 --> 01:50:40,442
Move! Come on! Let's move!

1191
01:51:05,093 --> 01:51:09,346
You should've heard your brother squeal
when I broke his fucking neck!

1192
01:51:12,642 --> 01:51:15,227
What do you figure the breakage?

1193
01:51:15,311 --> 01:51:17,312
Figure we take out the terrorists...

1194
01:51:17,397 --> 01:51:21,024
lose 20 -  25%
of the hostages... tops.

1195
01:51:21,109 --> 01:51:23,568
I can live with that.

1196
01:51:23,653 --> 01:51:28,490
Keep this thing on the deck.
They're expecting transports, not gunships.

1197
01:51:40,420 --> 01:51:44,047
Move it! Come on! Move!
Come on! Come on!

1198
01:51:44,132 --> 01:51:46,633
Move it!

1199
01:51:46,718 --> 01:51:49,511
Let's go! Move!

1200
01:51:52,056 --> 01:51:54,933
Theo.
A little bonus for us.

1201
01:51:55,017 --> 01:51:57,769
- Please, sit down. Sit down.
- Hey!

1202
01:51:57,854 --> 01:51:59,896
A policeman's wife
might come in handy.

1203
01:51:59,981 --> 01:52:03,567
McClane, l have some news for you.

1204
01:52:03,651 --> 01:52:05,777
McClane.

1205
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:18,081
Come on!
Move, move!

1206
01:52:20,209 --> 01:52:22,169
Come on!

1207
01:52:33,806 --> 01:52:35,932
Motherfucker, l'll kill you!

1208
01:52:39,187 --> 01:52:42,355
Armed. The truck?

1209
01:52:42,440 --> 01:52:44,441
The truck.

1210
01:52:50,948 --> 01:52:54,618
After all your posturing,
all your little speeches...

1211
01:52:54,702 --> 01:52:57,287
you're nothing but a common thief.

1212
01:52:57,371 --> 01:53:00,081
I am an exceptional thief,
Mrs. McClane.

1213
01:53:00,166 --> 01:53:03,376
And since I'm moving up to kidnapping,
you should be more polite.

1214
01:53:10,676 --> 01:53:12,803
Motherfucker, I'm gonna kill you!

1215
01:53:12,887 --> 01:53:16,348
I'm gonna fucking cook you,
and I'm gonna fucking eat you!

1216
01:53:38,955 --> 01:53:41,039
I don't like this, Sarge.

1217
01:53:51,759 --> 01:53:55,095
Just like fuckin' Saigon, eh, slick?

1218
01:53:56,597 --> 01:53:59,099
I was in junior high, dickhead.

1219
01:54:27,587 --> 01:54:30,380
Where's Holly?
Where's Holly Gennero?

1220
01:54:30,464 --> 01:54:34,134
Holly Gennero! Where's Holly?
Where's Holly? Where is she?

1221
01:54:34,218 --> 01:54:35,802
- They took her!
- Where?

1222
01:54:35,887 --> 01:54:37,679
- The vault!
- Where is the vault?

1223
01:54:37,763 --> 01:54:42,309
The 30th floor. Up the stairs.
They just took her!

1224
01:54:42,393 --> 01:54:46,563
Get downstairs, all of you!
The whole fuckin' roof is wired to blow. Get down!

1225
01:54:46,647 --> 01:54:51,401
Get down! Get the fuck downstairs!

1226
01:54:51,485 --> 01:54:54,946
- They made us, Bureau.
You got a terrorist shooting hostages.
- l see it. Bank left.

1227
01:55:02,371 --> 01:55:05,165
Nail that sucker!

1228
01:55:12,173 --> 01:55:15,216
I'm on your side, you assholes!

1229
01:55:15,301 --> 01:55:18,386
Shit. Swing around again!
I'll bag this little bastard.

1230
01:55:38,032 --> 01:55:40,533
What the fuck -
Jesus!

1231
01:55:42,119 --> 01:55:44,454
Oh, John, what the fuck
are you doing?

1232
01:55:44,538 --> 01:55:47,248
How the fuck
did you get into this shit?

1233
01:55:56,968 --> 01:56:00,387
There's something wrong.
They're coming back down.

1234
01:56:00,471 --> 01:56:02,806
- Blow the roof.
- But Karl's up there!

1235
01:56:02,890 --> 01:56:05,225
Blow the roof!

1236
01:56:07,395 --> 01:56:10,480
I promise l will never even think...

1237
01:56:10,564 --> 01:56:13,358
about going up
in a tall building again.

1238
01:56:16,570 --> 01:56:19,072
Oh, God.
Please don't let me die.

1239
01:56:31,585 --> 01:56:34,087
Holy shit!

1240
01:57:50,706 --> 01:57:53,249
Holy Christ!

1241
01:57:54,418 --> 01:57:56,920
We're gonna need some more
F.B.I. guys, I guess.

1242
01:58:09,725 --> 01:58:11,810
Jesus fucking Christ!

1243
01:58:38,045 --> 01:58:40,547
What the fuck is going on?

1244
01:58:42,716 --> 01:58:46,136
What are you gonna do, sit here while
the building falls down around your ears?

1245
01:58:53,477 --> 01:58:55,228
Shit!

1246
01:58:55,312 --> 01:58:57,772
Hey! All right!

1247
01:59:01,152 --> 01:59:06,364
Hang on, baby.
Hang on, honey. Oh, God.

1248
01:59:51,493 --> 01:59:53,161
Hans!

1249
02:00:07,176 --> 02:00:09,469
Jesus.

1250
02:00:09,553 --> 02:00:11,679
Hi, honey.

1251
02:00:34,078 --> 02:00:35,995
So that's what this was all about?

1252
02:00:36,080 --> 02:00:39,499
- A fucking robbery?
- Put down the gun.

1253
02:00:41,585 --> 02:00:43,503
Why did you have to nuke
the whole building, Hans?

1254
02:00:43,587 --> 02:00:46,631
When you steal $600,
you can just disappear.

1255
02:00:46,715 --> 02:00:49,759
When you steal 600 million,
they will find you...

1256
02:00:49,843 --> 02:00:52,262
unless they think
you're already dead.

1257
02:00:52,346 --> 02:00:54,305
Put down the gun.

1258
02:01:04,775 --> 02:01:08,319
Nein (No)! This is mine.

1259
02:01:08,404 --> 02:01:11,698
You got me.

1260
02:01:11,782 --> 02:01:14,409
Still the cowboy, Mr. McClane.

1261
02:01:14,493 --> 02:01:16,744
Americans, all alike.
Well, this time...

1262
02:01:16,829 --> 02:01:20,206
John Wayne does not
walk off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.

1263
02:01:20,291 --> 02:01:22,125
That's Gary Cooper, asshole.

1264
02:01:22,209 --> 02:01:24,002
Enough jokes.

1265
02:01:24,086 --> 02:01:26,963
You'd have made a pretty good
cowboy yourself, Hans.

1266
02:01:27,047 --> 02:01:31,718
Oh, yes.
What was it you said to me before?

1267
02:01:31,802 --> 02:01:37,015
Yippee-ki-yea, motherfucker.

1268
02:01:56,327 --> 02:01:58,202
Holly!

1269
02:02:03,375 --> 02:02:06,169
Happy trails, Hans.

1270
02:02:49,171 --> 02:02:51,297
I hope that's not a hostage.

1271
02:03:19,952 --> 02:03:23,996
Give me water hook-ups
for engine companies five, three, nine, six.

1272
02:03:27,626 --> 02:03:30,211
Over here. It's a better angle.

1273
02:03:30,295 --> 02:03:32,755
Let's give 'em a hand over there.

1274
02:03:34,383 --> 02:03:36,592
Keep it going now.
Keep it going.

1275
02:03:42,141 --> 02:03:44,058
Come on. Come on!
We're gonna miss it.

1276
02:03:44,143 --> 02:03:46,185
- Okay, hand me my notes.
- Come on!

1277
02:03:46,270 --> 02:03:48,771
Keep that water on there.

1278
02:04:08,500 --> 02:04:11,878
What was it like in there? How did they
treat you? Did they frighten you at all?

1279
02:04:11,962 --> 02:04:14,213
- Any comment?
- It was terrible. We don't wanna talk about it.

1280
02:04:14,298 --> 02:04:17,550
How does it feel to be outside?

1281
02:04:59,051 --> 02:05:01,010
Al, this is my wife Holly.

1282
02:05:01,094 --> 02:05:03,304
Holly Gennero.

1283
02:05:03,388 --> 02:05:06,807
- Holly McClane.
- Hello, Holly.

1284
02:05:06,892 --> 02:05:11,062
You got yourself a good man.
You take good care of him.

1285
02:05:11,146 --> 02:05:13,105
- McClane?
- Yeah, it's okay. Let him through.

1286
02:05:13,232 --> 02:05:15,274
McClane, I wanna debrief.

1287
02:05:15,359 --> 02:05:19,111
I want a debriefing.
You got some things to answer for, mister.

1288
02:05:19,196 --> 02:05:22,198
Ellis's murder, for one thing.
Property damage.

1289
02:05:22,282 --> 02:05:24,367
Interfering with police business.

1290
02:06:04,783 --> 02:06:07,994
All right, I want two of you
to go inside and see if there's anybody else.

1291
02:06:08,078 --> 02:06:10,121
Yes, sir.
I'll take the left.

1292
02:06:17,713 --> 02:06:21,173
- Watch it!
- Whoa. This one's with me.

1293
02:06:28,181 --> 02:06:31,475
Five, four, three, two.

1294
02:06:31,560 --> 02:06:34,145
Mr. McClane. Mr. McClane,
now that it's all over...

1295
02:06:34,229 --> 02:06:37,481
after this incredible ordeal,
what are your feelings?

1296
02:06:42,779 --> 02:06:45,072
Well, well, well.

1297
02:06:45,157 --> 02:06:47,867
- Merry Christmas, Argyle.
- Merry Christmas.

1298
02:06:50,996 --> 02:06:52,913
Did you get that?

1299
02:06:52,998 --> 02:06:56,042
Let me through.
Let me through. Thank you.

1300
02:06:56,126 --> 02:06:59,879
If this is their idea of Christmas,
I gotta be here for New Year's.

1301
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:03,077
