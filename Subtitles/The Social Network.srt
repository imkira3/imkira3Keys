1
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,010
Did you know there are more people
with genius IQs living in China

2
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,140
than there are people of any kind
living in the United States?

3
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,020
- That can't possibly be true.
- It is.

4
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,140
What would account for that?

5
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,230
Well, first, an awful lot of people
live in China, but here's my question.

6
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:29,440
How do you distinguish yourself
in a population of people

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,360
who all got 1600 on their SATs?

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,240
- I didn't know they take SATs in China.
- They don't.

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,450
I wasn't talking about China anymore,
I was talking about me.

10
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:36,990
You got a 1600?

11
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,910
Yes. I could sing in an a Capella group,
but I can't sing.

12
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,200
Does that mean you actually
got nothing wrong?

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,580
I could row crew or invent a $25 PC.

14
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,910
Or you could get into a final club.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,330
Or I get into a final club.

16
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,830
You know, from a woman's perspective,

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,790
sometimes not singing in
an a Capella group is a good thing.

18
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,920
This is serious.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,460
On the other hand,
I do like guys who row crew.

20
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,420
Well, I can't do that.

21
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,090
I was kidding.

22
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,340
And, yes, I got nothing wrong on the test.

23
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,220
- Have you ever tried?
- I'm trying right now.

24
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,140
- To row crew?
- To get into a final club.

25
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,470
To row crew? No.
Are you, like, whatever, delusional?

26
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,520
Maybe it's just sometimes
you say two things at once.

27
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,140
I'm not sure which one
I'm supposed to be aiming at.

28
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,150
But you've seen guys who row crew, right?

29
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,270
No.

30
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,440
Okay, well, they're bigger than me.
They're world-class athletes.

31
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,980
And a second ago,
you said you like guys who row crew

32
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,110
so I assumed you had met one.

33
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:18,200
I guess I just meant I like the idea of it.
You know, the way a girl likes cowboys.

34
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,780
Okay.

35
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,330
Should we get something to eat?

36
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,200
Would you like to talk
about something else?

37
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,710
No. It's just since the beginning of
the conversation about finals club,

38
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,670
I think I may have missed a birthday.

39
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,630
There are really more people in China with
genius IQs than the entire population...

40
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:36,050
The Phoenix is the most diverse.
The Fly Club... Roosevelt punched the Porc.

41
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,220
Which one?

42
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,800
The Porcellian, the Porc.
It's the best of the best.

43
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,640
- Which Roosevelt?
- Theodore.

44
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,060
Is it true that they send a bus around
to pick up girls

45
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,600
who want to party with
the next Fed chairman?

46
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,390
So you can see why
it's so important to get in.

47
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,020
Okay, well, which is the easiest to get into?

48
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,400
- Why would you ask me that?
- I was just asking.

49
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,650
None of them. That's the point.

50
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,660
My friend Eduardo made $300,000
betting oil futures one summer

51
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,070
and Eduardo won't come close to getting in.

52
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,120
The ability to make money doesn't
impress anybody around here.

53
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,450
Must be nice.
He made $300,000 in a summer?

54
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,870
- He likes meteorology.
- You said it was oil futures.

55
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,170
You can read the weather,
you can predict the price of heating oil.

56
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,340
I think you asked me that

57
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,210
because you think
the final club that's easiest to get into

58
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,550
is the one where I'll have the best chance.

59
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,970
I... What?

60
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,590
You asked me which one was
the easiest to get into

61
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,180
because you think that that's the one
where I'll have the best chance.

62
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,760
The one that's the easiest to get into
would be the one

63
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,020
where anybody has the best chance.

64
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,680
You didn't ask me which one
was the best one,

65
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,230
you asked me which one
was the easiest one.

66
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,900
I was honestly just asking, okay?
I was just asking to ask.

67
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,360
- Mark, I'm not speaking in code.
- Erica.

68
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,780
You're obsessed with finals clubs.

69
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,240
You have finals clubs OCD
and you need to see someone about it

70
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,990
who will prescribe you
some sort of medication.

71
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:45,580
You don't care if the side effects
may include blindness.

72
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,370
Final clubs. Not "finals clubs."

73
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,170
And there's a difference between
being obsessed and being motivated.

74
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,090
Yes. There is.

75
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,840
Well, you do.
That was cryptic, so you do speak in code.

76
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,170
I didn't mean to be cryptic.

77
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,010
I'm just saying I need to do
something substantial

78
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,930
in order to get the attention of the clubs.

79
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,760
- Why?
- Because they're exclusive.

80
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,260
And fun, and they lead to a better life.

81
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,930
Teddy Roosevelt didn't get elected president

82
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,930
because he was a member
of the Phoenix Club.

83
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,270
He was a member of the Porcellian,
and yes, he did.

84
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,730
Well, why don't you just concentrate
on being the best you you can be?

85
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,360
Did you really just say that?

86
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,940
I was kidding.

87
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,690
Just because something's trite
doesn't make it less true.

88
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,860
I wanna try to be straightforward with you

89
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,200
and tell you I think you might
want to be a little more supportive.

90
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,870
If I get in, I will be taking you
to the events and the gatherings,

91
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:31,120
and you'll be meeting a lot of people
you wouldn't normally get to meet.

92
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,710
You would do that for me?

93
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,750
We're dating.

94
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,210
Okay.

95
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,460
Well, I wanna try and be
straightforward with you

96
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,380
and let you know that we're not anymore.

97
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,970
- What do you mean?
- We're not dating anymore. I'm sorry.

98
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,140
- Is this a joke?
- No, it's not.

99
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,220
You're breaking up with me?

100
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,560
You're gonna introduce me to people

101
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,310
I wouldn't normally
have the chance to meet?

102
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,230
What the... What is that supposed to mean?

103
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,560
- Wait, settle down.
- What is it supposed to mean?

104
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,480
Erica, the reason we're able to sit here
and drink right now

105
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,320
is 'cause you used to sleep
with the door guy.

106
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,070
"The door guy"? His name is Bobby.
I have not slept with the door guy.

107
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,570
The door guy is a friend of mine,
and he's a perfectly good class of people.

108
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,160
And what part of Long Island
are you from, Wimbledon?

109
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,500
- Wait. Wait, wait.
- I'm going back to my dorm.

110
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,910
- Is this real?
- Yes.

111
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
- Then wait, I apologize, okay?
- I have to go study.

112
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,420
- Erica?
- Yes?

113
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,750
- I'm sorry, I mean it.
- I appreciate that, but I have to go study.

114
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,090
Come on, you don't have to study.
Let's just talk.

115
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,420
- I can't.
- Why?

116
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,430
Because it is exhausting.
Dating you is like dating a StairMaster.

117
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,680
All I meant is that you're not likely to...
Currently...

118
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,930
I wasn't making a comment
on your appearance.

119
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,180
I was saying that you go to BU.
I was stating a fact, that's all,

120
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,350
and if it seemed rude, then I apologize.

121
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,770
- I have to go study.
- You don't have to study.

122
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,190
Why do you keep saying
I don't have to study?

123
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,110
'Cause you go to BU.

124
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,650
Do you want to get some food?

125
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,200
I am sorry you are not sufficiently
impressed with my education.

126
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,200
And I'm sorry I don't have a rowboat,
so we're even.

127
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,030
- I think we should just be friends.
- I don't want friends.

128
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,200
I was just being polite.

129
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,450
I have no intention
of being friends with you.

130
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,620
I'm under some pressure right now
from my OS class

131
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,290
and if we could just order some food,
I think we should...

132
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:02,050
Okay, you are probably going to be
a very successful computer person.

133
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:05,130
But you're gonna go through life
thinking that girls don't like you

134
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,880
because you're a nerd.

135
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,550
And I want you to know from the bottom
of my heart that that won't be true.

136
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,680
It'll be because you're an asshole.

137
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:18,780
Erica Albright's a bitch.

138
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:21,410
Do you think that's because her family
changed their name from Albrecht,

139
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,750
or do you think it's because
all BU girls are bitches?

140
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,130
For the record, she may look like a 34C,

141
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,880
but she's getting all kinds of help
from our friends at Victoria's Secret.

142
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:38,050
She's a 34B, as in barely anything there.
False advertising.

143
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,890
The truth is, she has a nice face.

144
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,270
I need to do something
to take my mind off her.

145
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,940
Easy enough, except I need an idea.

146
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,240
I'm a little intoxicated, I'm not gonna lie.

147
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,240
So what if it's not even 10:00 p.m.
And it's a Tuesday night?

148
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,370
Billy.

149
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,200
The Kirkland facebook
is open on my desktop,

150
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,960
and some of these people have
pretty horrendous facebook pics.

151
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,630
Billy Olson's sitting here and had
the idea of putting some of the pictures

152
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,960
next to pictures of farm animals
and have people vote on who's hotter.

153
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,630
Good call, Mr. Olson.

154
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,010
Yeah, it's on.
I'm not gonna do the farm animals,

155
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,930
but I like the idea of comparing
two people together.

156
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,520
It gives the whole thing a very "Turing" feel

157
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,560
since people's ratings of the pictures
will be more implicit

158
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:31,190
than, say, choosing a number to
represent each person's hotness,

159
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,980
like they do on hotornot. Com.

160
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,610
The first thing we're going to need
is a lot of pictures.

161
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,900
Unfortunately, Harvard doesn't keep
a public centralized facebook,

162
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,030
so I'm going to have to get all the images

163
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,780
from the individual houses
that people are in.

164
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,620
Let the hacking begin.

165
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,680
First up is Kirkland.

166
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,760
They keep everything open and allow
indexes in their Apache configuration.

167
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:08,390
So a little Wget magic is all that's necessary
to download the entire Kirkland facebook.

168
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,520
Kids' stuff.

169
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,040
Next is Eliot.

170
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,250
They're also open,
but with no indexes on Apache.

171
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:31,370
I can run an empty search

172
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,840
and it returns all of the images
in the database in a single page.

173
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,210
And I can save the page and Mozilla
will save all the images for me.

174
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,920
Excellent. Moving right along.

175
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,470
Excuse me! Everybody!

176
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:44,970
You are at one of the oldest,
one of the most exclusive clubs,

177
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,850
not just at Harvard, but in the world.

178
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,230
And I want to welcome you all

179
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,730
to Phoenix Club's first party
of the fall semester!

180
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,530
Lowell has some security.
They require a user name/password combo,

181
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,780
and I'm gonna go ahead and say they don't
have access to the main FAS user database,

182
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,080
so they have no way
of detecting an intrusion.

183
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,000
Adams has no security, but limits
the number of results to 20 a page.

184
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,170
All I need to do is break out the same script
I used on Lowell and we're set.

185
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,760
Quincy has no online facebook.
What a sham.

186
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,130
Nothing I can do about that.

187
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:22,630
Dunster is intense.

188
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,430
Not only is there no public directory,
but there's no directory at all.

189
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,550
You have to do searches,

190
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,220
and if your search returns more
than 20 matches, nothing gets returned.

191
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:31,560
And once you do get results,
they don't link directly to the images.

192
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,230
They link to a PHP that redirects
or something. Weird.

193
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,770
This may be difficult. I'll come back later.

194
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,650
- Hey, Shark Week's on.
- What?

195
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,400
- Great white, beautiful fish.
- Nice.

196
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,150
Leverett is a little better.
They still make you search,

197
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,370
but you can do an empty search and get
links to pages with every student's picture.

198
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:48,120
It's slightly obnoxious that they
only let you view one picture at a time,

199
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,080
and there's no way I'm going to go
to 500 pages to download pics one at a time.

200
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,540
So it's definitely necessary to break out
Emacs and modify that Perl script.

201
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,680
Here you go.

202
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:12,980
Done.

203
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,150
Hey, what's going on?

204
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:18,900
Perfect timing. Eduardo's here
and he's going to have the key ingredient.

205
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,610
- Hey, Mark.
- Wardo.

206
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,690
You and Erica split up.

207
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,860
How did you know that?

208
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,490
It's on your blog.

209
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:28,120
- Yeah.
- Are you all right?

210
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,540
- I need you.
- I'm here for you.

211
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,660
No, I need the algorithm you use
to rank chess players.

212
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,000
- Are you okay?
- We're ranking girls.

213
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,380
- You mean other students.
- Yeah.

214
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,170
You think this is such a good idea?

215
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,760
- I need the algorithm.
- Mark...

216
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,670
I need the algorithm.

217
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:48,340
Give each girl a base rating of 1400.

218
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:52,890
At any given time Girl A has a rating R-a
and Girl B has a rating R-b.

219
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,730
When any two girls are matched up,
there's an expectation of which will win

220
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:56,940
based on their current rating, right?

221
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:00,520
Yeah. And those expectations
are expressed this way.

222
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,030
Let's write it.

223
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,630
One on the left.

224
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,420
The right.

225
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,920
Yeah, still the right.

226
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,840
- It works.
- Who should we send it to first?

227
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,960
- Dwyer.
- Neal.

228
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:28,130
- Who are you gonna send it to?
- Just a couple of people.

229
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,390
The question is,

230
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,060
who are they gonna send it to?

231
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,460
Hey, guys, check this out.

232
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,630
Someone go to the left. Dude, do left.

233
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,260
Look at these girls. Right or left?

234
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,590
- Left is hot.
- Left? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

235
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,390
Right or left?

236
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,270
That's my roommate.

237
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,270
- Oh, my God.
- The girl on the left.

238
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,350
This is pathetic.

239
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,480
Right.

240
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:23,770
Left.

241
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,440
- Left.
- Left?

242
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:27,860
Oh, shit.

243
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,030
Albright.

244
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,490
He blogged about you.

245
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,870
You don't wanna read it.

246
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,000
Left.

247
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,580
Latina.

248
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,880
Erica.

249
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,210
Is this yours?

250
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,750
I stole it from a tranny.

251
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,880
Get the hell out of here!

252
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,550
- Left.
- One on the right.

253
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,140
Left.

254
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,310
Man, that's an awful lot of traffic.

255
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:06,730
You think maybe we shouldn't shut it down
before we get into trouble?

256
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,780
Hello?

257
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,910
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What?

258
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:22,870
At 4:00 in the morning?

259
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,090
Well, there's a very unusual amount
of traffic to the switch at Kirkland.

260
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,630
You're saying it's unusual
for 4:00 in the morning?

261
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:31,800
No, this'd be unusual
for halftime at the Super Bowl.

262
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,840
All right.

263
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,140
I gotta go in.

264
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,270
What's going on?

265
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,980
Harvard's network is about to crash.

266
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,280
You don't think...

267
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,570
I do.

268
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,490
Go see if it's everybody's.

269
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,410
I can't connect.

270
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,380
The network's down.

271
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,130
Unless it's a coincidence, I think this is us.

272
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,670
It's not a coincidence.

273
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:12,630
Holy shit.

274
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:18,470
So you were called in front of the Ad Board.

275
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,220
That's not what happened.

276
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,930
You weren't called in front
of the Administrative Board?

277
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:25,770
No, back. I mean back at the bar
with Erica Albright. She said all that?

278
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,480
- Mark...
- That I said that stuff to her?

279
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,230
I was reading from the transcript
of her deposition.

280
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,980
Yeah, why would you even need
to depose her?

281
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,740
That's really for us to decide.

282
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:36,360
You think if I know she can make me
look like a jerk, I'll be more likely to settle.

283
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:37,870
Why don't we stretch our legs for a minute?

284
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,700
Can we do that?
It's been almost three hours.

285
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:43,450
And frankly, you did spend an awful lot
of time embarrassing Mr. Zuckerberg

286
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,370
with the girl's testimony from the bar.

287
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,080
I'm not embarrassed,
she just made a lot of that up.

288
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,250
She was under oath.

289
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,710
Then I guess that would be the first time
somebody's lied under oath.

290
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,520
The site got 2,200 hits within two hours?

291
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,980
Thousand.

292
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,230
What?

293
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,190
Twenty-two thousand.

294
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,610
Wow.

295
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,880
These guys are just freaking fast.

296
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,010
Is there any way to make this a fair fight?

297
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,850
Jump out and swim.

298
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,480
I think we'd have to jump out and drown.

299
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,600
Well, you could row forward
and I could row backward.

300
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:51,940
We're genetically identical.
Science says we'd stay in one place.

301
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,110
Just row the damn boat.

302
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,950
- You guys hear about this?
- What?

303
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,660
Two nights ago, a sophomore choked
the network from a laptop at Kirkland.

304
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,250
- Really?
- At 4:00 a.m.

305
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,830
How?

306
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,960
He set up a website where you vote
on the hotness of female undergrads.

307
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,880
What were we doing
that none of us heard about this?

308
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,010
I don't know.

309
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:18,630
A three-hour low-rate
technical row before breakfast.

310
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,180
Full course load. Studying.

311
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,550
Another three hours in the tank
and then studying.

312
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,850
I'm not sure how we missed it.

313
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,560
How much activity was there on this thing?

314
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,430
Twenty-two thousand page requests.

315
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,350
Twenty-two thousand?

316
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,900
Cam, this guy hacked
the facebook of seven houses.

317
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,650
He set up the whole website in one night,
and he did it while he was drunk.

318
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:35,900
Twenty-two thousand?

319
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,400
- Well, how do you know he was drunk?
- He was blogging simultaneously.

320
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:43,160
- You know what I think?
- Way ahead of you.

321
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,910
This is our guy.

322
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,910
Cameron Winklevoss.

323
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,210
W-l-N-K-L-E-V-O-S-S.

324
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,580
"Cameron" spelled the usual way.

325
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,250
Tyler Winklevoss.

326
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,670
Tyler spelled the usual way, and my
last name is the same as my brother's.

327
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,470
Mr. Zuckerberg, this is
an Administrative Board hearing.

328
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,760
You're being accused
of intentionally breaching security,

329
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,260
violating copyrights,

330
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:10,640
violating individual privacy
by creating the website www.facemash.com.

331
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,520
You're also charged with
being in violation of university policy,

332
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,820
on distribution of digitized images.

333
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,940
Before we begin with our questioning,
you're allowed to make a statement.

334
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,240
Would you like to do so?

335
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,280
I...

336
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:27,990
You know, I've already apologized
in The Crimson to the ABHW,

337
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,660
to Fuerza Latina,

338
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,080
and to any women at Harvard
who may have been insulted,

339
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,420
as I take it that they were.

340
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,380
As for any charges stemming
from the breach of security,

341
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,340
I believe I deserve
some recognition from this board.

342
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,470
- I'm sorry?
- Yes.

343
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,550
I don't understand.

344
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,680
Which part?

345
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,850
You deserve recognition?

346
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:53,060
I believe I've pointed out
some pretty gaping holes in your system.

347
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,150
- Excuse me, may I?
- Yes.

348
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,650
Mr. Zuckerberg,

349
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,940
I'm in charge of security
for all computers on the Harvard network,

350
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,450
and I can assure you of its sophistication.

351
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:07,120
In fact, it was that level of sophistication
that led us to you in less than four hours.

352
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:08,830
- Four hours?
- Yes, sir.

353
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:09,950
That would be impressive,

354
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,370
except if you had known
what you were looking for,

355
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,250
you would have seen it
written on my dorm room window.

356
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,000
So?

357
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,420
Six months academic probation.

358
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,760
Wow. Well, they had to make
an example out of you.

359
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,430
They had my blog.

360
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,300
I shouldn't have written
that thing about the farm animals.

361
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,680
That was stupid.

362
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,850
But I was kidding, for God's sakes.
Doesn't anybody have a sense of humor?

363
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,350
- I tried to stop you.
- I know.

364
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,980
How do you do this thing where
you manage to get all girls to hate us?

365
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,980
- And why do I let you?
- I know.

366
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:43,570
- You can't do that.
- Wardo, I said I know.

367
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,740
Okay, let's look at a sample problem.

368
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:49,200
Suppose we're given a computer
with a 16-bit virtual address

369
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,580
and a page size of 256 bytes.

370
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,870
The system uses one-level page tables
that start at address hex 400.

371
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:00,590
Maybe you want DMA on your 16-bit system.
Who knows?

372
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:04,340
The first few pages are reserved
for hardware flags, etc.

373
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:07,300
Assume page-table entries have
eight status bits.

374
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,220
The eight status bits would then be...

375
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,600
Anybody?

376
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:15,310
And I see we have our first surrender.

377
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,690
Don't worry, Mr. Zuckerberg.

378
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,980
Brighter men than you
have tried and failed this class.

379
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:23,860
One valid bit, one modified bit,
one reference bit and five permission bits.

380
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,200
That is correct.

381
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,160
Does everybody see how he got there?

382
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,000
Mark?

383
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:40,040
- You Mark Zuckerberg?
- Yeah.

384
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,340
- Cameron Winklevoss.
- Hi.

385
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,460
Tyler Winklevoss.

386
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,920
Are you guys related?

387
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,510
- That's good.
- Funny.

388
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,050
We never heard that before.

389
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,430
So, what can I do for you?
Did I insult your girlfriends?

390
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,600
No. You didn't. Actually, I don't know.

391
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,390
- Yeah, we never asked.
- We should do that.

392
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,520
No.

393
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,560
We have an idea
we want to talk to you about.

394
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,940
You got a minute?

395
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:03,070
You guys look like
you spend some time at the gym.

396
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,690
- We have to.
- Why?

397
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,190
We row crew.

398
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:09,110
- Yeah, I've got a minute.
- Great.

399
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,120
- So, you ever been inside the Porcellian?
- No.

400
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,830
You understand we can't take you
past the bike room,

401
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,000
because you're not a member.

402
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,500
I've heard.

403
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:26,260
- You want a sandwich or something?
- Okay.

404
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,010
- Mark, right?
- Yeah.

405
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:30,090
- Mark, this is Divya Narendra, our partner.
- Hi.

406
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,010
We were really impressed with Facemash.

407
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,680
When we checked you out,
you also built CourseMatch.

408
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:35,810
I don't know CourseMatch.

409
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:38,310
You go online and see
what courses your friends are taking.

410
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,020
It's really smart, man.

411
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,270
- Mark.
- Yeah.

412
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,150
We were talking about CourseMatch.

413
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,190
It was kind of a no-brainer.

414
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,240
But you invented something
in high school, too, right?

415
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,740
An app for an MP3 player
that recognizes your taste in music.

416
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,790
Anybody try to buy it?

417
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:57,450
Microsoft.

418
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,620
Wow. How much?

419
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,790
Didn't sell it. Uploaded it for free.

420
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,540
- For free?
- Yeah.

421
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:04,840
Why?

422
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:09,260
Okay, well, we have something
that we've been working on for a while

423
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,420
and we think it's great.

424
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,760
It's called the Harvard Connection.

425
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,260
You create your own page.
Interests, bio, friends, pics.

426
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:17,640
And then people can go online,
see your bio, request to be your...

427
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,140
Yeah, how is that different
from MySpace or Friendster?

428
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,150
Harvard. Edu.

429
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,650
Harvard. Edu is the most prestigious
e-mail address in the country, man.

430
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,070
I mean, the whole site's kind of
based on the idea that girls...

431
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,070
Not to put anything indelicately, but...

432
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,910
Girls wanna go with guys
who go to Harvard.

433
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:36,280
Divya and my brother don't have trouble
putting things indelicately.

434
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:39,870
The main difference between what we're
talking about and MySpace or Friendster,

435
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,370
or any of those other
social networking sites is...

436
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,210
Is exclusivity. Right?

437
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,090
- Right.
- Yeah.

438
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:47,630
We'd love for you to work with us, Mark.

439
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,420
I mean, we need a gifted programmer
who's creative.

440
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,130
And we know that
you've been taking it in the shins.

441
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:54,140
Women's groups are ready
to declare a fatwa.

442
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,680
But, you know, this could help
rehabilitate your image.

443
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:59,680
Wow. You would do that for me?

444
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,350
We'd like to work with you.

445
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,520
Our first programmer graduated
and went to work for Google.

446
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:09,190
Our second programmer
just got overwhelmed with schoolwork.

447
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,490
We would need you to build the site and
write the code, and we'll provide all the...

448
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:13,860
I'm in.

449
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,530
What?

450
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:18,530
I'm in.

451
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:19,950
Awesome.

452
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,700
That's what you said?

453
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,080
It was three or four years ago.
I don't know what I said.

454
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,500
When did you come to Eduardo?

455
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,590
I don't understand that question.

456
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:30,340
Do you remember answering
in the affirmative?

457
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:32,170
The affirmative?

458
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,220
When did you come to Eduardo
with the idea for Facebook?

459
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,930
It was called The Facebook then.

460
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,550
This doesn't need to be that difficult.

461
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,140
I'm currently in the middle
of two different lawsuits.

462
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,600
Did you answer affirmatively

463
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:45,140
when Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss
and Divya Narendra

464
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,810
asked you to build Harvard Connection?

465
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,560
Did you say yes?

466
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,440
I said I'd help.

467
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:54,530
When did you approach Mr. Saverin
with the idea for The Facebook?

468
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:56,110
I wouldn't say I approached him.

469
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,370
- Sy.
- You can answer the question.

470
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:00,870
At a party at Alpha Epsilon Pi.

471
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:02,330
What's that?

472
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:04,370
The Jewish fraternity.

473
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,210
It was Caribbean Night.

474
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:27,140
It's not that guys like me
are generally attracted to Asian girls.

475
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:30,150
It's that Asian girls are
generally attracted to guys like me.

476
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,270
I'm developing an algorithm
to define the connection

477
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,280
between Jewish guys and Asian girls.

478
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,360
I don't think it's that complicated.
They're hot, they're smart,

479
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:40,410
they're not Jewish, and they can't dance.

480
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,950
Hey, Mark's here.

481
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,240
Mark!

482
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:47,960
Be right back.

483
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,550
I think I've come up with something.

484
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,840
Hang on. I gotta tell you something
that you're not gonna believe.

485
00:25:58,970 --> 00:25:59,970
What?

486
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,350
I got punched by the Phoenix.

487
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,640
- Are you kidding?
- No.

488
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:07,060
I mean, it's just the first
of a four-step process,

489
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,940
but they slid the invitation
under my door tonight.

490
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,900
I go to my first punch party tomorrow.

491
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,150
So...

492
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,650
You got punched by the Phoenix.

493
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,450
Yeah, but, you know,
it was probably just a diversity thing.

494
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:21,030
It was just a diversity thing.
Just ride that horse until...

495
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,830
What did you wanna talk to me about?

496
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,370
- Mark?
- Yeah.

497
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:25,490
You said you'd come up with something.

498
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,210
Yeah, I think I've come up with something.
Come outside and let's talk.

499
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:29,580
It's 20 degrees outside.

500
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,830
I can't stare at that loop of Niagara Falls,

501
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,000
which has absolutely
nothing to do with the Caribbean.

502
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,140
People came to Facemash
in a stampede, right?

503
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,310
Yeah.

504
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:49,980
But it wasn't because
they saw pictures of hot girls.

505
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,270
You can go anywhere on the Internet
and see pictures of hot girls.

506
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,400
Yeah.

507
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,150
It was because they saw pictures
of girls that they knew.

508
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,570
People want to go on the Internet
and check out their friends,

509
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,110
so why not build a website that offers that?

510
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,320
Friends, pictures, profiles,
whatever you can visit.

511
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:05,200
Browse around.
Maybe it's someone you just met at a party.

512
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:07,410
But I'm not talking about a dating site.

513
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:12,920
I'm talking about taking the entire social
experience of college and putting it online.

514
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,590
- I can't feel my legs.
- I know.

515
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,210
I'm totally psyched about this, too.
But, Wardo?

516
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,380
Yeah?

517
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,550
"It would be exclusive."

518
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:23,640
You would have to know the people
on the site to get past your own page.

519
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,600
Like getting punched.

520
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,600
Now, that's good.

521
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,850
Wardo, it's like a final club,
except we're the president.

522
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:33,100
I told him I thought it sounded great.

523
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,230
It was a great idea.

524
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,360
There was nothing to hack.

525
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,490
People were gonna provide
their own pictures, their own information.

526
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:44,370
And people had the ability to invite,
or not invite, their friends to join.

527
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:48,490
See, in a world where
social structure was everything,

528
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,410
that was the thing.

529
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,290
It was a big project,

530
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:55,540
and he was going to have to write
tens of thousands of lines of code,

531
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:58,250
so I wondered why he was
coming to me and not his roommates,

532
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:01,010
Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes.
They were programmers.

533
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:04,470
We're gonna need a little start-up cash
to rent the servers and get it online.

534
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,680
So that was why.

535
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,390
- Did he offer terms?
- Yes.

536
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:10,430
We'll split it, 70/30.

537
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,060
70 for me, 30 for you
for putting up the $1,000

538
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,400
and for handling everything
on the business end. You're CFO.

539
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,520
And you said?

540
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:18,230
I said, "Let's do it."

541
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,190
Okay. Did he add anything else?

542
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:21,650
Yes.

543
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,950
It probably was a diversity thing.

544
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,330
But so what?

545
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,790
Why do you think he said that?

546
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:34,080
Gretchen, excuse me for interrupting,
but whose discovery is this?

547
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,920
Sy, if you'll let me continue
with my line of questioning.

548
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,080
What are you suggesting?

549
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:39,340
That I was jealous of Eduardo
for getting punched by the Phoenix

550
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,000
and began a plan
to screw him out of a company

551
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:42,800
- I hadn't even invented yet.
- Were you?

552
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,130
- Gretchen.
- Jealous of Eduardo?

553
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,470
Stop typing. We're off the record.

554
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,590
Ma'am, I know you've done your homework,

555
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,260
and so you know that money
isn't a big part of my life.

556
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,350
But at the moment,
I could buy Mount Auburn Street,

557
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:53,640
take the Phoenix Club
and turn it into my ping-pong room.

558
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,860
I'll let you know how the party is.

559
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,990
We recognize that you're a plaintiff
in one suit involving Facebook,

560
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,490
and a witness in another.

561
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,660
Yes, sir.

562
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,750
At any time in the weeks
prior to Mark's telling you his idea,

563
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:17,330
did he mention Tyler Winklevoss,
Cameron Winklevoss,

564
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,710
Divya Narendra or Harvard Connection?

565
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,460
Yes. He said they'd asked him
to work on their site,

566
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:26,470
but that he looked at what they had
and decided it wasn't worth his time.

567
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,140
He said even his most pathetic friends

568
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:32,100
knew more about getting people
interested in a website than these guys.

569
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,100
"These guys," meaning my clients.

570
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:38,150
Yes. He resented...
Mark resented that your clients thought

571
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:40,650
that he needed to rehabilitate
his image after Facemash.

572
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:42,820
But Mark didn't want
to rehabilitate anything.

573
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,690
With Facemash, he'd hacked into
the Harvard computers,

574
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:48,410
he'd thumbed his nose at the Ad Board,
he'd gotten a lot of notoriety.

575
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:51,120
Facemash did exactly
what he wanted it to do.

576
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,660
Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg
was building The Facebook,

577
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,540
he was also communicating
with the plaintiffs?

578
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,790
Not at the time, I wasn't. But...

579
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:02,500
It really didn't have much to do
with the Winklevosses' dating site.

580
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,630
How would you know?
You weren't even there.

581
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:04,800
Ty.

582
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:08,220
Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg
was building The Facebook,

583
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:11,760
he was leading the plaintiffs to believe
he was building Harvard Connection?

584
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:13,310
You're offering a conclusion
not found in evidence.

585
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:16,060
We are about to find it in evidence.

586
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,980
From Mark Zuckerberg to Tyler Winklevoss.

587
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,980
November 30th, 2003.

588
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,860
"I read over all the stuff you sent me
re: Harvard Connection.

589
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,490
"And it seems like it shouldn't
take too long to implement.

590
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:31,280
"So we can talk about it after I get all
the basic functionality up tomorrow night."

591
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:35,790
From Mark Zuckerberg
to Cameron Winklevoss. December 1 st, 2003.

592
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:39,370
"Sorry I was unreachable tonight.
I just got about three of your missed calls.

593
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:42,290
"I was working on a problem set
for my systems class."

594
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,670
From Mark Zuckerberg
to Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.

595
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,920
December 10, 2003.

596
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:50,180
"This week has been pretty busy
thus far with classes and work,

597
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:53,390
"so I think it's probably best
to postpone the meeting."

598
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,600
"I'm also really busy tomorrow."

599
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:59,060
Okay, anybody else feel like
there's something up with this guy?

600
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,190
Tell him okay,

601
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:03,020
but we do have to make sure that
we meet up before we all go off for break.

602
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:06,360
I know, I know. Yeah, watch out.

603
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,520
Hey, Mark.

604
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,520
I need a dedicated Linux box
running Apache with a MySQL back end.

605
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,100
It's gonna cost a little more money.

606
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:45,560
- How much more?
- About 200 more.

607
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:48,150
- Do we need it?
- Gotta handle the traffic.

608
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:53,360
- Do it.
- I already did.

609
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,830
Hey, guess what?

610
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,160
I made the second cut.

611
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:03,920
That's good.

612
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,670
You should be proud of that right there.
Don't worry if you don't make it any further.

613
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,970
I'll get out of here.

614
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:16,390
From Mark Zuckerberg
to Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss

615
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:17,510
and Divya Narendra.

616
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,770
December 15th, 2003.

617
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:22,230
"I have a CS problem set
that I'm just getting started with

618
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:25,980
"and it should be about 15 hours of coding,
so I'll be busy tomorrow night."

619
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:29,400
"I won't really be free to meet
until next Wednesday afternoon."

620
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,610
"I have to cancel Wednesday afternoon.

621
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:34,860
"I've basically been in the lab
this whole time, and also I..."

622
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:39,580
"...won't be able to do Saturday,
as I have to meet up with my parents."

623
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:48,130
As the plaque reads, this is John Harvard,
founder of Harvard University in 1638.

624
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:50,550
It's also called the Statue of Three Lies.

625
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,470
What are the three lies?

626
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,430
Mr. Dowd.

627
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,640
The three lies. First...

628
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,850
Shit!

629
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:00,760
- Take your pants off.
- I know.

630
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:03,180
Mr. Saverin.

631
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:06,810
One, Harvard was founded in 1636, not 1638.

632
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,230
Two, Harvard was not founded
by John Harvard.

633
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,860
And three, that is not John Harvard.

634
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,280
Who is it?

635
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:16,490
It's a friend of the sculptor, Daniel Chester.

636
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:18,530
Keep your jacket on.

637
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,960
Thirty-nine days after Mr. Zuckerberg's
initial meeting with my clients,

638
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:29,420
and he still hadn't completed work
on Harvard Connection.

639
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,300
But on January 11th, 2004,

640
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:36,260
Mr. Zuckerberg registered
the domain name The Facebook

641
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:39,140
via Network Solutions.

642
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:44,270
To the best of your knowledge, had he even
begun work on Harvard Connection?

643
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,480
Not to my knowledge. No.

644
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:53,900
What in the world is this?

645
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:59,110
"Hey, Cameron, I'm still a little skeptical
that we have enough functionality in the site

646
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,780
"to really draw the attention
and gain the critical mass necessary

647
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:04,490
"to get a site like this to run"?

648
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,410
"We'll speak soon"?

649
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:11,330
This is the first time
he mentioned any problem?

650
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,500
Yes, it was.

651
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:17,090
You sent 36 e-mails to Mr. Zuckerberg
and received 16 e-mails in return,

652
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,760
and this was the first time
he indicated he was not happy.

653
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,890
That's correct.

654
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:23,640
He had 42 days to study our system
and get out ahead.

655
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,810
- Do you see any of your code on Facebook?
- Sy, could you...

656
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:27,430
Did I use any of your code?

657
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,350
You stole our whole goddamn idea.

658
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,650
- Fellas.
- What? Match.com for Harvard guys?

659
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:32,860
Can I continue with my deposition?

660
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:36,070
You know, you really don't need
a forensics team to get to the bottom of this.

661
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,780
If you guys were the inventors of Facebook,

662
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,160
you'd have invented Facebook.

663
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:44,530
I can't wait to stand over your shoulder
and watch you write us a check.

664
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,910
No shit.

665
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,000
Let's continue.

666
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:53,130
February 4, 2004.

667
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:59,800
Mark.

668
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,760
There is a girl in your art history class.
Her name is Stephanie Attis.

669
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:05,720
Do you happen to know
if she has a boyfriend?

670
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,390
Have you ever seen her with anyone?

671
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,690
And, if not, do you happen to know
if she's looking to go out with anyone?

672
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,070
Dustin.

673
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:21,280
People don't walk around with
a sign on them that says...

674
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:26,580
Mark?

675
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,440
We were supposed to meet at 9:00.

676
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,280
- Have you slept yet?
- I have to add something.

677
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,530
What?

678
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,660
Shit, that looks good.
That looks really good.

679
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,210
It's clean and simple.

680
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:17,000
No Disneyland, no "live nude girls."
But watch.

681
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,130
What'd you write?

682
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:23,180
"Relationship Status." "Interested In."

683
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,180
This is what drives life at college.
"Are you having sex or aren't you?"

684
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:29,560
It's why people take certain classes
and sit where they sit and do what they do.

685
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:33,520
And at its center, you know, that's
what The Facebook is gonna be about.

686
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,810
People are gonna log on because
after all the cake and watermelon,

687
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,940
there's a chance they're actually gonna...

688
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,230
- Gonna get laid.
...meet a girl. Yes.

689
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:40,860
That is really good.

690
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:41,990
And that was it.

691
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,740
- What do you mean?
- It's ready.

692
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,950
- It's ready? Right now?
- Yeah. That was it.

693
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:48,030
And here's the masthead.

694
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,580
- You made a masthead.
- Yeah.

695
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:53,040
- "Eduardo Saverin, co-founder and CFO."
- Yeah.

696
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,170
You have no idea what
that's gonna mean to my father.

697
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,580
Sure I do.

698
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:01,130
So when's it going live?

699
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:04,130
Right now. Get your laptop out.

700
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,890
What? Why do we need my laptop?

701
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:10,470
Because you got e-mails
for everybody at the Phoenix.

702
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:18,060
Yeah, I'm not sure if it's gonna be cool
with them that I spam their e-mails.

703
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:20,860
- This is not spam.
- No, I know it's not spam.

704
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,280
If we send it to our friends,
it's just gonna bounce around Dworkin.

705
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,690
I haven't gotten in yet.

706
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,820
These guys know people.
And I need their e-mails.

707
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,870
- Sure.
- Good.

708
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,160
Give me the mailing list.

709
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:35,580
Jabberwock12.listserv@harvard.edu.

710
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,830
These guys.

711
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,960
Yeah, they're literary geniuses

712
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,170
because the world's most obvious
Lewis Carroll reference is in...

713
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,800
- They're not so bad.
- I'm just saying.

714
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,670
Yeah, you're right.

715
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:52,100
The site's live.

716
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,230
You know, let's go get a drink and celebrate.

717
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:58,140
I'm buying.

718
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,730
Mark.

719
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:04,900
Mark, are you praying?

720
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:20,880
Whatever happened to Cole Porter
and Irving Berlin?

721
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,040
It's a Valentine's Day theme.
They're playing love songs.

722
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,170
Good point.

723
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:27,170
'Cause Cole Porter and Irving Berlin
never wrote any love songs.

724
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:33,350
Honey, you should put your laptop away.

725
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:35,390
Seven different people
spammed me the same link.

726
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:37,060
- KC.
- What is it?

727
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,180
I don't know.

728
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:40,020
But I'm really hoping
it's Cats That Look Like Hitler,

729
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,810
'cause I can never get enough of that.

730
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,480
No, it's not.

731
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,200
Div!

732
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,950
What?

733
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,710
This isn't mine.

734
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,540
Okay, what is wrong?

735
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,960
It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

736
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:24,650
Hey!

737
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:25,900
Not now!

738
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,070
We need 20 minutes!

739
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,530
Okay.

740
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,860
I just wanted to let you know
that Zuckerberg stole our website.

741
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:36,120
Mark Zuckerberg?

742
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,410
He stole our website.

743
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,870
It's been live for more than 36 hours.

744
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:48,590
Mr. Hotchkiss?
Ty, lawyer's on the phone with Dad.

745
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:51,220
Yes, sir, I'm here with my brother Tyler
and our business partner Divya.

746
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,340
"Welcome to The Facebook.

747
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:54,340
"The Facebook is an online directory
that connects people

748
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:55,890
"through different social networks.

749
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:59,140
"You must have a harvard. Edu address
to register."

750
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,680
Yeah, I called earlier.
I'm looking for Mark Zuckerberg.

751
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:03,100
Yes, sir.
He's actually quoted a couple times.

752
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,230
I can read it to you.

753
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:07,520
"'Everyone's been talking a lot about a
universal facebook within Harvard,' he says."

754
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:08,650
"He" meaning Mark.

755
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:10,690
"'I think it's kind of silly
that it would take the university

756
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,900
"'a couple of years to get around to it.

757
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:14,530
"'I can do a classier job than they can
and I did it in a week."'

758
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,820
Tell him Divya Narendra called.

759
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:17,990
- I know, that's how he talks.
- Appreciate it.

760
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,160
"As of yesterday evening, Zuckerberg said,

761
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:24,000
"over 650 students had registered
to use thefacebook. Com.

762
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:27,670
"He said he anticipated that 900 students
would have joined the site by this morning."

763
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,010
Yeah, Divya was just reading that 650
students signed up for it on the first day.

764
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:35,340
God, if I was a drug dealer I couldn't
give free drugs to 650 people in one day.

765
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:38,930
And this guy doesn't have three friends
to rub together to make a fourth.

766
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:40,520
All right.
Yes, that's what we'll do, Mr. Hotchkiss.

767
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,520
We'll put all this together
and we'll e-mail it to you.

768
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,350
Well, you won't be able
to go on the website yourself.

769
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:47,520
Because you don't have a Harvard...

770
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:49,940
You know what, it would just be easier
for us to e-mail it to you.

771
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,030
I'm sure you're right.

772
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:54,030
He's a good guy and he's very bright
and I'm sure he didn't mean to do...

773
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:55,200
Wow.

774
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,700
...what he did.

775
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,030
All right, thank you very much. And, Dad...

776
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,700
All right, love you, too.

777
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:03,540
- This is a good guy?
- We don't know that he's not a good guy.

778
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,620
We know he stole our idea.

779
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:06,120
We know he lied to our faces
for a month and a half.

780
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:08,380
- No, he never lied to our faces.
- Okay, he never saw our faces.

781
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:11,880
Fine, he lied to our e-mail accounts
and he gave himself a 42-day head start,

782
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,970
because he knows
what apparently you don't,

783
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:15,800
which is that getting there first
is everything.

784
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:16,890
I'm a competitive racer, Div.

785
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:20,390
I don't think you need to school me in the
importance of getting there first. Thank you.

786
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,810
- That was your father's lawyer?
- It was his in-house counsel.

787
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:24,810
He's gonna look at all this
and if he thinks it's appropriate

788
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:25,890
he'll send a cease-and-desist letter.

789
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,060
What's that gonna do?

790
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,480
What, do you wanna hire an IP lawyer
and sue him?

791
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,730
No, I wanna hire the Sopranos to beat
the shit out of him with a hammer.

792
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:32,900
- We don't even have to do that.
- That's right.

793
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:36,320
We could do that ourselves.
I'm 6'5", 220, and there's two of me.

794
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,410
- I'm with this guy.
- Well, whatever.

795
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:39,910
I'm saying, let's calm down
until we know what we're talking about.

796
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:42,080
How much more information
are you waiting for?

797
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,000
We met with Mark three times,
we exchanged 52 e-mails,

798
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,660
we can prove that he looked at the code.

799
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:49,830
- What is that on the bottom of the page?
- It says "A Mark Zuckerberg production."

800
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,170
- On the home page?
- On every page.

801
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:54,920
Shit, I need a second to let
the classiness waft over me.

802
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:56,090
Okay, look, we don't know...

803
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,090
Cam, they wrote, "Zuckerberg said
he hoped the privacy options

804
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,090
"would help restore his reputation

805
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:03,180
"following student outrage
over facemash. Com."

806
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:06,600
That's exactly what we said to him.
He's giving us the finger in The Crimson.

807
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:09,350
While we're waiting for Dad's lawyer
to look this stuff over,

808
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,860
we can at least get something
going in the paper so people know...

809
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,440
- What?
...that this is in dispute.

810
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:15,610
We're not starting a knife fight
in The Crimson.

811
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:17,110
And we're not suing anybody.

812
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,530
Why not?

813
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:22,450
I don't understand, I don't understand.
Why not?

814
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,450
He's gonna say it's stupid.

815
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:26,540
What, who, me?

816
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:28,120
Say it. Why not?

817
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,710
Because we're gentlemen of Harvard.

818
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:36,130
This is Harvard, where you don't
plant stories and you don't sue people.

819
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,720
You thought he was gonna be
the only one who thought that was stupid?

820
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,470
During the time when you say
you had this idea,

821
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:46,640
did you know Tyler and Cameron
came from a family of means?

822
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:48,810
"A family of means"?

823
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:50,440
Did you know their father was wealthy?

824
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:52,980
I'm not sure why you're asking me that.

825
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,320
It's not important you be sure
why I'm asking.

826
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,400
- It's not important to you.
- Sy.

827
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:00,320
Did you know that they came from money?

828
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:02,320
I had no idea whether
they came from money or not.

829
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:04,410
In one of your e-mails to Mr. Narendra,

830
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:07,830
you referenced Howard Winklevoss'
consulting firm.

831
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,160
If you say so.

832
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:13,000
Howard Winklevoss founded a firm whose
assets are in the hundreds of millions.

833
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:15,340
You also knew Tyler and Cameron
were members

834
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:17,760
of a Harvard final club called the Porcellian.

835
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,090
They pointed that out.

836
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:21,180
- Excuse us for inviting you in.
- To the bike room.

837
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:25,260
Please. So it's safe to say you were aware
that my clients had money.

838
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:27,930
Yes.

839
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:29,430
Let me tell you why I'm asking.

840
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,940
I'm wondering why, if you needed $1,000
for an Internet venture,

841
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,610
you didn't ask my clients for it.

842
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:37,190
They had demonstrated an interest to you
in that kind of thing.

843
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:40,360
I went to my friend for the money because
that's who I wanted to be partners with.

844
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:42,950
Eduardo was the president of
the Harvard Investors Association,

845
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:44,990
and he was also my best friend.

846
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:49,450
Your best friend is suing you
for $600 million.

847
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,370
I didn't know that. Tell me more.

848
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,710
Eduardo, what happened
after the initial launch?

849
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,050
I'm sorry, Sy, would you mind
addressing him as Mr. Saverin?

850
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:58,800
- Gretchen, they're best friends.
- Not anymore.

851
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,880
Well, we already went through this on the...
Never mind.

852
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:03,640
Mr. Saverin, what happened
after the initial launch?

853
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,140
It exploded.

854
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:07,060
Everybody on campus was using it.

855
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:10,730
"Facebook me" was a common expression
after two weeks.

856
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,230
And Mark?

857
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:16,150
And Mark was the biggest thing on
a campus that included 19 Nobel laureates,

858
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:20,740
15 Pulitzer Prize winners,
two future Olympians, and a movie star.

859
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,490
Who was the movie star?

860
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:24,160
Does it matter?

861
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:25,570
No.

862
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:31,620
...at Out of Town News and picked up
that copy of Popular Electronics magazine

863
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:33,920
with the MIT'S Altair kit on the cover.

864
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,540
It was a beautiful day
and I was in my Radcliffe dorm room.

865
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:38,670
He brought that magazine up
and he showed it to me and he said,

866
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:42,630
"Look, it's gonna happen without us.
We've gotta start now."

867
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,890
And I said, "Okay.
Let's get BASIC out there."

868
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:49,350
Now, most of you think you know
the rest of the story, but you may not.

869
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:51,720
The beginnings of this industry
were very humble.

870
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:56,060
That kit computer on the cover of
that magazine had an 8080 processor in it.

871
00:44:56,150 --> 00:45:00,270
Unless you paid extra for
a 1 K memory board, you got 256 bytes.

872
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:04,780
So the challenge when I wrote BASIC
wasn't just to run at 4 k-bytes,

873
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:09,780
but I also had to leave room for the users
to run their programs in 4 k-bytes.

874
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:12,950
Your friend. Is that Mark Zuckerberg?

875
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:14,330
Yeah.

876
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:16,620
- He made The Facebook.
- Yeah.

877
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,290
I mean, it's both of ours. We're...

878
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:21,250
Yeah, we... Yes.

879
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:22,510
Cool.

880
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,260
I'm Christy Ling. This is Alice.

881
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:25,380
Hi.

882
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:27,680
Well, very nice to meet you.

883
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:29,510
Facebook me when you get home.

884
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,140
You know, maybe we can all go out
and grab a drink.

885
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:32,970
Certainly.

886
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:34,980
Absolutely do that.

887
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,940
She said, "Facebook me
and we can all go for a drink later,"

888
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:46,570
which is stunningly great for two reasons.

889
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:49,370
One, she said "facebook me," right?
And then the other is, well, you know...

890
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:50,490
They wanna have drinks later.

891
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:52,200
Yes, have you ever heard
so many different good things

892
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:53,830
packed into one regular-sized sentence?

893
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:55,620
Excuse me, Mark?

894
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,250
Yeah?

895
00:45:57,330 --> 00:45:59,170
I'm Stuart Singer. I'm in your OS lab.

896
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:00,880
Sure.

897
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:03,210
- Awesome job with The Facebook.
- Awesome job.

898
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:04,340
Thanks.

899
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,260
- I'm Bob.
- How you doing?

900
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:07,760
You know, I could swear
he was looking at you

901
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:11,050
when he said the next Bill Gates
could be right in this room.

902
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:12,640
I doubt it.

903
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,270
And I showed up late.
I don't even know who the speaker was.

904
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,190
It was Bill Gates.

905
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,440
Shit, that makes sense.

906
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:24,360
All right. Thanks, guys.

907
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:28,570
- Are you a moron?
- Are you medically stupid?

908
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,360
You can't tell Bill Gates
is in front of you for an hour?

909
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:32,280
I wasn't wearing my contacts.

910
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:34,740
Can I get a Glock and kill you?

911
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:37,960
It's time to monetize the thing.

912
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,330
What were their names?

913
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,210
- Hear what I just said?
- When?

914
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:43,380
I said it's time to monetize the site.

915
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:45,380
What does that mean?

916
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:48,300
It means it's time for the website
to start generating revenue.

917
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:50,720
No, I know what the word means.
I'm asking how you wanna do it.

918
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:53,720
- Advertising.
- No.

919
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:56,270
Well, we got 4,000 members.

920
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:57,520
'Cause The Facebook is cool,

921
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,810
and if we start installing pop-ups
for Mountain Dew, it's not gonna be cool.

922
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,520
Well, I wasn't thinking Mountain Dew,
but at some point,

923
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:05,070
and I'm talking as the business end
of the company, the site...

924
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:08,360
We don't even know what it is yet.
We don't know what it is.

925
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,910
We don't know what it can be.
We don't know what it will be.

926
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:12,320
We know that it is cool.

927
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:14,620
That is a priceless asset I'm not giving up.

928
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:16,910
- So when will it be finished?
- It won't be finished.

929
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,700
That's the point.
The way fashion's never finished.

930
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:21,080
- What?
- Fashion. Fashion is never finished.

931
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:22,630
You're talking about fashion? Really, you?

932
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:25,290
I'm talking about the idea of it
and I'm saying that it's never finished.

933
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:28,760
Okay. But they manage
to make money selling pants.

934
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:31,510
Mark, what is this?

935
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:33,050
- What?
- This.

936
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:35,430
It's called a cease-and-desist letter.
What were their names?

937
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:36,560
- Who?
- The girls.

938
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:37,810
When did you get this?

939
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:40,020
About 10 days ago.
Right after we launched the site.

940
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:41,940
- Jesus Christ.
- Hey, the girls. What were their names?

941
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:45,150
The Winklevoss twins are saying
that you stole their idea.

942
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:47,610
I find that to be a little more
than mildly annoying.

943
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:50,950
Oh, well, they find it to be
intellectual property theft.

944
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:52,240
- Look...
- Why didn't you show this to me?

945
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,820
It was addressed to me.

946
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:57,030
They're saying that we stole The Facebook
from Divya Narendra and the Winklevosses.

947
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:59,160
- I know what it says.
- Did we?

948
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:00,290
Did we what?

949
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:01,960
Don't screw around with me now.
Look at me.

950
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:04,290
The letter says we could face legal action.

951
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:06,040
No, it says I could face legal action.

952
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:08,380
This is from a lawyer, Mark.
They must feel they have some grounds.

953
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:11,590
- The lawyer is their father's house counsel.
- Do they have grounds?

954
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,090
The grounds are
our thing is cool and popular,

955
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:14,590
and Harvard Connection is lame.

956
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,930
Wardo, I didn't use any of their code,
I promise.

957
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:18,060
I didn't use anything.

958
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:19,970
Look, a guy who builds a nice chair
doesn't owe money

959
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:21,680
to everyone who ever
has built a chair, okay?

960
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:23,600
They came to me with an idea,
I had a better one.

961
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:26,400
- Why didn't you show me this letter?
- I didn't think it was a big deal.

962
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:29,900
Okay.

963
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:36,820
So if there's something wrong, if there's
ever anything wrong, you can tell me.

964
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,540
I'm the guy that wants to help.
This is our thing.

965
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:43,080
Now, is there anything
that you need to tell me?

966
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:44,620
No.

967
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,460
What are we doing about this?

968
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:52,970
I went to a 3L at Student Legal Services
and he told me to write them back.

969
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:54,220
And what did you say?

970
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:57,430
"When we met in January,
I expressed my doubts about the site.

971
00:48:57,510 --> 00:48:59,890
"Where it stood with graphics,
how much programing was left

972
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:01,390
"that I had not anticipated."

973
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,730
"The lack of hardware
we had to deal with site use,

974
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:07,060
"the lack of promotion that would go on
to successfully launch the website."

975
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:10,730
This was the first time you raised
any of those concerns, right?

976
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:12,440
I'd raised concerns before.

977
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:13,780
- Bullshit.
- Not to us.

978
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:17,910
Gentlemen, I'm talking about at the meeting
in January to which this letter is referring.

979
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:19,030
Yeah.

980
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,990
Let me rephrase this.

981
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:25,750
You sent my client 16 e-mails.
In the first 15 you didn't raise any concerns.

982
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:26,920
Is that a question?

983
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,540
In the 16th e-mail you raised concerns
about the site's functionality.

984
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:33,380
- Were you leading them on for six weeks?
- No.

985
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:36,550
Then why didn't you raise
any of these concerns before?

986
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,510
- It's raining.
- I'm sorry?

987
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,850
It just started raining.

988
00:49:39,930 --> 00:49:43,020
Mr. Zuckerberg,
do I have your full attention?

989
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:44,930
No.

990
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:47,400
Do you think I deserve it?

991
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:48,730
What?

992
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:51,770
Do you think I deserve your full attention?

993
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,360
I had to swear an oath
before we began this deposition

994
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:57,570
and I don't wanna perjure myself,
so I have a legal obligation to say no.

995
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:01,450
Okay. No.
You don't think I deserve your attention?

996
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:04,580
I think if your clients wanna sit on
my shoulders and call themselves tall,

997
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:05,790
they have a right to give it a try,

998
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:09,210
but there's no requirement that I enjoy
sitting here listening to people lie.

999
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:12,710
You have part of my attention.
You have the minimum amount.

1000
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:16,010
The rest of my attention is
back at the offices of Facebook,

1001
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:18,380
where my colleagues and I are doing things
that no one in this room,

1002
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:20,050
including and especially your clients,

1003
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:23,470
are intellectually or creatively
capable of doing.

1004
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:27,270
Did I adequately answer
your condescending question?

1005
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:37,950
Well, I have 12:45.
Why don't we say that's lunch?

1006
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:41,240
Back at 2:30.

1007
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,200
So what were their names?

1008
00:50:45,790 --> 00:50:48,000
Their names were Christy and Alice,

1009
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:53,090
and they wanna have drinks tonight.

1010
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:58,590
You're not supposed to be in here.
This is a men's room.

1011
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:03,800
Wow.

1012
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:19,240
Oh, my God.

1013
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,660
I don't care.

1014
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:44,850
Hey, man, sorry.

1015
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:47,850
A couple girls are freshening up in there.

1016
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:50,270
Sweet.

1017
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:56,400
We have groupies.

1018
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:06,200
I'll be right back.

1019
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,080
Mark, where you going? Mark.

1020
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:14,380
Erica?

1021
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:17,340
Hi.

1022
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:20,050
I saw you from over there.
I didn't know you came to this club a lot.

1023
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:21,840
- First time.
- Mine, too.

1024
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:23,800
Could I talk to you alone for a second?

1025
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:26,260
I think I'm good right here.

1026
00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:30,390
I just... I'd love to talk to you alone
if we could just go someplace.

1027
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,730
Right here is fine.

1028
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,520
I don't know if you heard about
this new website I launched.

1029
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:35,690
No.

1030
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:39,280
- The Facebook?
- You called me a bitch on the Internet, Mark.

1031
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,190
That's why I wanted to talk to you.

1032
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,280
- On the Internet.
- That's why I came over.

1033
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,990
Comparing women to farm animals.

1034
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:46,950
I didn't end up doing that.

1035
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:48,700
It didn't stop you from writing it.

1036
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:51,370
As if every thought that tumbles
through your head was so clever

1037
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:53,750
it would be a crime for it not to be shared.

1038
00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:57,880
The Internet's not written in pencil, Mark,
it's written in ink,

1039
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,880
and you published that Erica Albright
was a bitch,

1040
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:05,340
right before you made some ignorant crack
about my family's name, my bra size,

1041
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:07,260
and then rated women
based on their hotness.

1042
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:10,470
- Erica, is there a problem?
- No, there's no problem.

1043
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,680
You write your snide bullshit
from a dark room

1044
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:16,560
because that's what the angry do nowadays.

1045
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,610
I was nice to you. Don't torture me for it.

1046
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:21,650
If we could just go somewhere for a minute...

1047
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,940
I don't wanna be rude to my friends.

1048
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:26,450
Okay.

1049
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,620
Good luck with your video game.

1050
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:32,620
Hey, that was great.
That was the right thing to do.

1051
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,620
You apologized, right?

1052
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:38,630
We have to expand.

1053
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:40,130
Sure. Mark?

1054
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:44,050
Is he mad about something?

1055
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:47,300
Okay, we are expanding
to Yale and Columbia.

1056
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:49,090
Dustin, I want you to share
the coding work with me.

1057
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:50,970
Chris, you're gonna be in charge
of publicity and outreach,

1058
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:53,270
and you could start by getting a story
in the BU student newspaper.

1059
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:54,390
It's The Bridge.

1060
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,730
They hate doing stories about Harvard.

1061
00:53:55,810 --> 00:53:57,730
Somebody at the newspaper
will be a computer science major.

1062
00:53:57,810 --> 00:54:00,230
Tell them that Mark Zuckerberg
will do 10 hours of free programing.

1063
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,020
Why do you want a story
in the BU newspaper?

1064
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:03,320
Because I do. Now here's the arrangement.

1065
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,400
Eduardo is CFO
and owns 30% of the company.

1066
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:07,030
Dustin is vice president
and head of programing,

1067
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:09,700
and his 5% of the company
will come from my end.

1068
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,080
Chris is director of publicity,

1069
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,540
and his compensation will depend on
how much work he ends up doing.

1070
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:14,660
Any questions?

1071
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:18,330
- Who are the girls?
- Sorry. They're Christy and Alice.

1072
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:19,710
- Hi.
- Hi.

1073
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:21,210
- Hello.
- Hi.

1074
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:23,130
Is there anything we can do?

1075
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:24,300
No, that's it.

1076
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:26,720
- Yale and Columbia, let's go.
- And Stanford.

1077
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,430
- What?
- Stanford.

1078
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:31,720
It's time for them to see this in Palo Alto.

1079
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:38,940
You don't want any lunch?

1080
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:40,100
No.

1081
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,190
You're welcome to some salad.

1082
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:43,820
No, thank you.

1083
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,160
This must be hard.

1084
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:53,740
Who are you?

1085
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:56,830
I'm Marylin Delpy.
I introduced myself when we first...

1086
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:58,290
I mean, what do you do?

1087
00:54:58,370 --> 00:55:00,500
I'm a second-year associate at the firm.

1088
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:03,170
My boss wanted me to sit in
on the deposition phase.

1089
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:05,960
What are you doing?

1090
00:55:06,050 --> 00:55:09,050
Checking in to see how it's going in Bosnia.

1091
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:10,380
Bosnia.

1092
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:13,680
They don't have roads,
but they have Facebook.

1093
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,350
You must really hate the Winklevosses.

1094
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:23,440
I don't hate anybody.

1095
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:27,940
The Winklevi aren't suing me
for intellectual property theft.

1096
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:30,570
They are suing me because
for the first time in their lives,

1097
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:33,070
things didn't work out the way
they were supposed to for them.

1098
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:42,210
He's expanding.

1099
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,460
What?

1100
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:44,960
He's expanding
to Yale, Columbia and Stanford.

1101
00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:46,210
It's gonna be in The Crimson tomorrow.

1102
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,340
- Really?
- Yep.

1103
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:50,670
Well, looks like that cease-and-desist letter
really scared the shit out of him, huh?

1104
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:54,050
I wanna hire a lawyer to file for injunctive
relief and get the site taken down now.

1105
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:57,100
Every minute the site is up,
Harvard Connection becomes less valuable.

1106
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:59,980
I want an injunction. I want damages.
I want punitive relief.

1107
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:01,100
And I want him dead.

1108
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:02,270
Yeah, I want those things, too.

1109
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:03,650
Then why aren't we doing anything about it?

1110
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:05,020
Because we're gentlemen of Harvard?

1111
00:56:05,110 --> 00:56:06,820
No, it's because you're not thinking
how it's gonna look.

1112
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:07,940
How's it gonna look?

1113
00:56:08,030 --> 00:56:09,230
Like my brother and I
are in skeleton costumes

1114
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:11,570
chasing the Karate Kid
around a high school gym.

1115
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:15,280
Cam, he's violated Massachusetts state law.

1116
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:17,200
When he goes to Connecticut,
New York and California,

1117
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:18,620
he'll have violated federal law.

1118
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:20,500
And, by the way,
he's in violation of Harvard law.

1119
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:22,500
There's no such thing as Harvard law.

1120
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:25,080
Wait. Yeah, there is.

1121
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:31,510
Harvard Student Handbook.

1122
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:34,390
Every freshman is issued one of these,
and somewhere in this book it says...

1123
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:35,890
You can't steal from another student.

1124
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:39,600
This is what we needed.
We're going to Summers.

1125
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,560
Well, you can't get a meeting
with Larry Summers.

1126
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,480
My brother and I,
we pay tuition at this school.

1127
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,770
We carry a 3.9 GPA at this school.
We've won trophies for this school.

1128
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:49,320
And we'll be rowing in the Olympics
for this school.

1129
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:52,860
I want a meeting with
the goddamn president of this school.

1130
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:54,450
Why Stanford?

1131
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:56,320
Why do you think?

1132
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:01,950
I'm sorry.

1133
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,620
I'm late for biochem.

1134
00:57:05,290 --> 00:57:06,330
Okay.

1135
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:10,420
You don't know my name, do you?

1136
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:12,260
Is it Stanford?

1137
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:14,930
I should just kick your ass.

1138
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:17,180
How do you go to a party
and you meet someone...

1139
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:20,510
Amelia Ritter, but you prefer Amy.
You're from Orinda.

1140
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,770
Your father's in commercial real estate
and your mother's 10 years sober.

1141
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:25,440
What's my major?

1142
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:27,520
- Trombone.
- Really?

1143
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:30,020
I remember something about a trombone.

1144
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:35,110
French.

1145
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,280
Your major's French.

1146
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,030
- And yours?
- Mine?

1147
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,330
- I don't have one.
- You haven't declared?

1148
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:42,790
I don't go to school.

1149
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:44,710
- You're kidding.
- No.

1150
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,040
Well, where did you go to school?

1151
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,460
William Taft Elementary, for a little while.

1152
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:50,630
Seriously?

1153
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:53,630
You're not like 15 years old or anything,
are you?

1154
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,380
No.

1155
00:57:56,050 --> 00:57:57,130
Wait, you're not like 15, are you?

1156
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:58,340
No.

1157
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:01,560
So, what do you do?

1158
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,310
I'm an entrepreneur.

1159
00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:06,890
- You're unemployed.
- I wouldn't say that.

1160
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:08,060
What would you say?

1161
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:09,310
That I'm an entrepreneur.

1162
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:11,060
Well, then, what was your latest preneur?

1163
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:15,820
Well, I founded an Internet company that
let folks download and share music for free.

1164
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:17,240
Kind of like Napster?

1165
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:18,740
Exactly like Napster.

1166
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:20,490
What do you mean?

1167
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:21,910
I founded Napster.

1168
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:23,990
Sean Parker founded Napster.

1169
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,410
Nice to meet you.

1170
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,330
You're Sean Parker?

1171
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,250
You see, the shoe's on the other...

1172
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:31,420
- Foot?
- Table, which has turned.

1173
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:34,250
I just slept with Sean Parker?

1174
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:36,050
You just slept on Sean Parker.

1175
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:38,680
- You're a zillionaire.
- Not technically.

1176
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,260
What are you?

1177
00:58:40,930 --> 00:58:42,600
Broke. There's not
a lot of money in free music,

1178
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:46,020
even less when you're being sued by
everyone who's ever been to the Grammys.

1179
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:47,600
This is blowing my mind.

1180
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:48,690
I appreciate that.

1181
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:50,600
I gotta hop in the shower
and get ready for class.

1182
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:54,110
Biochem, even though you're
a French major whose name is Amy.

1183
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:55,860
You passed.

1184
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,280
I'm a hard worker.

1185
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:02,620
There's juice or anything else you can find.
Help yourself.

1186
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:03,780
You mind if I check my e-mail?

1187
00:59:04,370 --> 00:59:05,950
Yeah, go ahead.

1188
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,130
Amy!

1189
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:20,470
Jesus.

1190
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:22,890
- Amy! Can you come out here?
- Yeah?

1191
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,260
Just a second.

1192
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:29,730
There's a snake in here, Amy.

1193
00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:30,890
What?

1194
00:59:33,310 --> 00:59:34,400
Where?

1195
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:35,900
There isn't a snake,
but I need to ask you something.

1196
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:37,990
Are you kidding me? I could've been killed.

1197
00:59:38,110 --> 00:59:39,240
How?

1198
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:43,070
By running too fast
and getting twisted in the curtain.

1199
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,830
What do you need to ask me?

1200
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:47,740
Yeah, I went to check my e-mail and
there's a website open on your computer.

1201
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:52,080
Yeah, after you passed out last night
I went on The Facebook for a little bit.

1202
00:59:52,170 --> 00:59:54,330
- What's that?
- The Facebook?

1203
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:57,420
Stanford's had it for, like, two weeks now.

1204
00:59:57,630 --> 01:00:00,760
It's really awesome,
except it's freakishly addictive.

1205
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:03,180
Seriously, I'm on the thing
like five times a day.

1206
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:04,760
Mind if I send myself an e-mail?

1207
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:06,350
Yeah, is everything okay?

1208
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:08,270
Everything's great.

1209
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:13,270
I just need to find you, Mark Zuckerberg.

1210
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:18,780
I've never been in this building before.

1211
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:23,200
This building's 100 years older
than the country it's in, so do be careful.

1212
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:26,200
We're sitting in chairs.

1213
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,160
Yes.

1214
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,370
Very good. You can go in now.

1215
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,630
That's their own stupidity.
I should've been there.

1216
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:40,300
Well, darkness is the absence of light,

1217
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:43,220
and the stupidity in that instance
was the absence of me.

1218
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:45,220
Catherine, I've got students
in my office now.

1219
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:47,220
Students. Undergrads.

1220
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:48,810
I don't know.

1221
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:51,640
From the looks of it, they want
to sell me a Brooks Brothers franchise.

1222
01:00:51,730 --> 01:00:52,980
All right, bye-bye.

1223
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:54,900
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

1224
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:56,900
I'm Cameron Winklevoss
and this is my brother, Tyler.

1225
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:59,070
And you're here because...

1226
01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:01,570
Either of you can answer.

1227
01:01:01,650 --> 01:01:03,150
I'm sorry, sir,
I thought you were reading the letter.

1228
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:04,320
I've read the letter.

1229
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:07,660
Well, we came up with an idea for
a website called Harvard Connection...

1230
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:10,910
We've since changed the name to ConnectU.
And Mark Zuckerberg stole that idea...

1231
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,410
I understand.

1232
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:15,000
And I'm asking what you want me
to do about it.

1233
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:19,000
Well, sir, in the Harvard Student Handbook,
which is distributed to each freshman,

1234
01:01:19,090 --> 01:01:21,420
under the heading "Standards of Conduct
in the Harvard Community,"

1235
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:25,180
it says the college expects all students
to be honest and forthcoming

1236
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:27,680
in their dealings with members
in this community.

1237
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:30,260
Students are required to respect
public and private ownership,

1238
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:32,770
and instances of theft, misappropriation or...

1239
01:01:32,890 --> 01:01:34,350
- Anne?
- Yes, sir?

1240
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,270
Punch me in the face. Go ahead.

1241
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:43,190
...or unauthorized use
will result in disciplinary action,

1242
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,280
including the requirement
to withdraw from the college.

1243
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,450
And you memorized that
instead of doing what?

1244
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:50,950
What my brother and I came here today
to ask of you, respectfully, of course...

1245
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:54,200
Sir, it's against university rules to steal
from another student, plain and simple.

1246
01:01:54,290 --> 01:01:55,540
And you've spoken to your House Master?

1247
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:57,960
Yes, sir. And the House Master made
a recommendation to the Ad Board,

1248
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:59,630
but the Ad Board won't see us.

1249
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:01,550
Have you tried dealing with
the other student directly?

1250
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:04,460
Mr. Zuckerberg hasn't been responding
to any of our e-mails or phone calls

1251
01:02:04,590 --> 01:02:05,630
for the last two weeks.

1252
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,550
He doesn't answer when
we knock on his door at Kirkland,

1253
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,470
and the closest I've come
to dealing with him face-to-face

1254
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,890
is when I saw him on the quad
and chased him through Harvard Square.

1255
01:02:11,970 --> 01:02:13,060
You chased him?

1256
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:15,730
I saw him and I know he saw me.
I went after him and then he disappeared.

1257
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,900
- I don't see this as a university issue.
- Of course this is a university issue.

1258
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:22,400
There's a code of ethics and an honor code
and he violated them both.

1259
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:25,940
You enter into a code of ethics with
the university, not with each other.

1260
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:29,990
I'm sorry, President Summers, but what
you just said makes no sense to me at all.

1261
01:02:30,070 --> 01:02:31,240
I'm devastated by that.

1262
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:33,990
What my brother means is, if
Mark Zuckerberg walked into our dorm room

1263
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:36,250
and stole our computer,
that would be a university issue.

1264
01:02:36,330 --> 01:02:38,670
I really don't know.
This office doesn't handle petty larceny.

1265
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:40,080
This isn't petty larceny.

1266
01:02:40,170 --> 01:02:42,340
This idea is potentially worth
millions of dollars.

1267
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:43,590
- Millions?
- Yes.

1268
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:46,260
You might just be letting
your imaginations run away with you.

1269
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:49,180
Sir, I honestly don't think you're
in any position to make that call.

1270
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:53,510
I was the US Treasury Secretary.
I'm in some position to make that call.

1271
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:54,930
Letting our imaginations run away with us

1272
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:56,930
is exactly what we were told to do
in your freshman address.

1273
01:02:57,020 --> 01:03:00,020
Well, then I would suggest
that you let your imaginations

1274
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:01,440
run away with you on a new project.

1275
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:02,690
You would?

1276
01:03:02,770 --> 01:03:04,190
Yes. Everyone at Harvard's
inventing something.

1277
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:08,950
Harvard undergraduates believe that
inventing a job is better than finding a job.

1278
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:12,780
So I'll suggest again that the two of you
come up with a new new project.

1279
01:03:12,870 --> 01:03:15,950
- I'm sorry, sir, but that's not the point.
- Please, arrive at the point.

1280
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:17,790
You don't have to be
an intellectual property expert

1281
01:03:17,870 --> 01:03:19,370
to understand the difference
between right and wrong.

1282
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,290
And you're saying that I don't?

1283
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:23,380
- Of course I'm not saying that, sir.
- I'm saying that.

1284
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:25,170
- Really?
- Sir.

1285
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:27,300
Anne, how did they get this appointment?

1286
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:29,300
Colleagues of their father.

1287
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:33,140
Let me tell you something,
Mr. Winklevoss, Mr. Winklevoss,

1288
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:35,640
since you're on the subject
of right and wrong.

1289
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:39,980
This action, this meeting,
the two of you being here is wrong.

1290
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:43,560
It's not worthy of Harvard.
It's not what Harvard saw in you.

1291
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:46,070
You don't get special treatment.

1292
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:48,650
- We never asked...
- Just start another project?

1293
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:50,570
Like we're making a diorama
for a science fair?

1294
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,160
If you have a problem
with that, Mr. Winklevoss...

1295
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:53,320
We never asked for special treatment.

1296
01:03:53,410 --> 01:03:57,080
...the courts are always at your disposal.
Is there anything else I can do for you?

1297
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,830
You can take the Harvard
Student Handbook and shove it...

1298
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:00,000
Ty.

1299
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,870
Thank you very much for your time, sir.

1300
01:04:08,090 --> 01:04:09,380
Whoops.

1301
01:04:09,590 --> 01:04:12,090
Broke your 335-year-old doorknob.

1302
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:16,850
Eduardo, spring break, you
and Mr. Zuckerberg took a trip to New York.

1303
01:04:16,930 --> 01:04:19,520
- Yes.
- What was the purpose of the trip?

1304
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:23,270
Well, as CFO, I had set up some meetings
with potential advertisers.

1305
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,110
Who paid for the trip?

1306
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:28,280
It was paid for out of the $1,000 account
I had set up a few months earlier.

1307
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:32,200
At this point, your $1,000 was the only
money that had been put into the company?

1308
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:34,280
- Yes.
- How did you feel the meetings went?

1309
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:37,870
- They went terribly.
- Why?

1310
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:39,200
Mark was asleep.

1311
01:04:39,290 --> 01:04:40,700
I was not asleep.

1312
01:04:40,790 --> 01:04:42,120
Can I rephrase my answer?

1313
01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:44,290
I wish he'd been asleep.

1314
01:04:47,090 --> 01:04:50,590
So we're in 29 schools now,
with over 75,000 members.

1315
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:52,550
People who go on The Facebook

1316
01:04:52,630 --> 01:04:55,050
tend to stay on longer
than almost any other website.

1317
01:04:55,140 --> 01:04:56,890
Now, here's the most impressive statistic.

1318
01:04:56,970 --> 01:04:59,970
91% of people who try it once
will come back.

1319
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:01,930
- Now, if you'll allow me...
- Excuse me one second.

1320
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:04,390
What sound is he making? Is that like a tsk?

1321
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,070
It wasn't a tsk.

1322
01:05:09,230 --> 01:05:10,570
It was...

1323
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:13,320
Like a glottal stop.

1324
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:15,660
Almost a gag reflex.

1325
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:18,990
Guys, what is this?

1326
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:21,750
There was one more meeting scheduled
for the New York trip.

1327
01:05:21,830 --> 01:05:23,160
Yes, it was a dinner.

1328
01:05:23,250 --> 01:05:24,660
It was set up through
my girlfriend at the time.

1329
01:05:24,830 --> 01:05:27,830
Would you say that Mark was
excited about this meeting?

1330
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,170
Yes. Very.

1331
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:32,260
- Look, they're not gonna card us.
- They might.

1332
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:34,170
- I mean, look around.
- It'll be embarrassing.

1333
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:37,090
- Tell him they're not gonna card us.
- They're not gonna card us.

1334
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:39,100
- Mark...
- Are you gonna talk about ads again?

1335
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:40,930
Unless you're the ballet theater of Hartford,

1336
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,020
the purpose of a business
is to make a profit.

1337
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:44,270
It isn't a business yet.

1338
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:48,150
That's tough for me, 'cause my...
Never mind.

1339
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:52,530
He's 25 minutes late.

1340
01:05:52,610 --> 01:05:55,360
He founded Napster when he was 19.
He can be late.

1341
01:05:55,490 --> 01:05:57,110
- He's not a god.
- Then what is he?

1342
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,700
He's 25 minutes late.

1343
01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:00,030
I think Wardo's jealous.

1344
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:03,330
I honestly wasn't jealous. I was nervous.

1345
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:04,540
Why?

1346
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:08,120
Well, I didn't know him at all, but I had
done a search and I'd asked around.

1347
01:06:08,210 --> 01:06:11,500
And he struck me as kind of a...

1348
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:14,840
A wild card.

1349
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:16,050
Why?

1350
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:19,470
He crashed out of two pretty big
Internet companies in spectacular fashion,

1351
01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:20,970
he's had a reputation with drugs...

1352
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:22,310
He also founded the companies.

1353
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:23,720
We don't need him.

1354
01:06:24,350 --> 01:06:25,390
He's here.

1355
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:30,150
No, no, take your time.

1356
01:06:30,230 --> 01:06:32,980
- And he does own a watch.
- Stop it.

1357
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:36,070
- I'm Sean Parker.
- How do you do?

1358
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:39,070
You must be Eduardo. And Christy.
And Mark.

1359
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,160
- Great to meet you.
- Great to meet you.

1360
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:42,740
You guys don't have anything
in front of you.

1361
01:06:42,870 --> 01:06:43,910
- No.
- Tori.

1362
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
We were waiting.

1363
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:47,250
- Hey, baby boy.
- Can you bring out some things?

1364
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:50,170
The lacquered pork with that ginger confit.
Tuna tartare?

1365
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:52,090
And the lobster claws, that'll get us started.

1366
01:06:52,210 --> 01:06:54,090
Christy, what do you like to drink?

1367
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:56,920
An appletini.

1368
01:06:57,010 --> 01:06:59,050
Great. Four of those.

1369
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:02,430
From that point on, it was a Seanathon.

1370
01:07:11,270 --> 01:07:13,940
The question was,
"What did you talk about?"

1371
01:07:25,410 --> 01:07:27,700
He took us through his episode
with Napster.

1372
01:07:27,790 --> 01:07:30,790
I didn't wanna spend my 20s
as a professional defendant.

1373
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:33,960
Who knew? The music industry
doesn't have a sense of humor.

1374
01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:37,300
We tried to sell the company to pay the
35 million they said we owed in royalties,

1375
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:41,890
but I guess to them that was a little like
selling a stolen car to pay for the stolen gas.

1376
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:45,060
So we said screw it, declared bankruptcy.

1377
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:47,810
- But you made a name for yourself.
- And you are dry.

1378
01:07:47,890 --> 01:07:49,640
- Tori!
- No, no, I'm good.

1379
01:07:49,730 --> 01:07:51,940
And then he went on to
his second business venture,

1380
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,650
which was an online Rolodex that
he got thrown out of by Case Equity.

1381
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:57,730
And I wanted to do it nice this time.

1382
01:07:58,150 --> 01:08:01,740
I put on a tie and I shined my shoes,
but nobody wants to take orders from a kid.

1383
01:08:01,820 --> 01:08:04,740
So let me tell you what happens to
a 20-year-old at the top of a hot dot-com.

1384
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:07,990
- I'm not a psychiatrist, but...
- I'm glad we've got that on the record.

1385
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:10,330
You're not a psychiatrist, but what?

1386
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:13,290
A psychiatrist would say
that he was paranoid.

1387
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:15,920
They'll hire private detectives
who'll follow you day and night.

1388
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,090
You're a target for high-priced escorts.

1389
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:20,510
I can't prove it,
but I know they tap my phones.

1390
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:23,180
Whatever it is that's gonna trip you up,
you've done already.

1391
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:25,850
Private behavior is a relic
of a time gone by.

1392
01:08:25,930 --> 01:08:28,770
And if somehow, someway, you've managed
to live your life like the Dalai Lama,

1393
01:08:28,850 --> 01:08:30,020
they'll make shit up.

1394
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:32,690
Because they don't want you,
they want your idea.

1395
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:34,520
And they want you
to say "thank you" while you...

1396
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:36,020
Excuse me.

1397
01:08:36,110 --> 01:08:37,520
...wipe your chin and walk away.

1398
01:08:37,650 --> 01:08:38,690
That's what happened to you?

1399
01:08:38,820 --> 01:08:40,360
And delusional.

1400
01:08:41,030 --> 01:08:44,110
Yes. But there'll be payback at Case.

1401
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:45,780
I brought down the record companies
with Napster

1402
01:08:45,870 --> 01:08:47,200
and Case'll suffer for their sins, too.

1403
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:49,790
Sorry, you didn't bring down
the record companies.

1404
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:51,200
They won.

1405
01:08:51,370 --> 01:08:53,040
- In court.
- Yeah.

1406
01:08:53,370 --> 01:08:55,960
You wanna buy a Tower Records, Eduardo?

1407
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:01,800
And he told story after story
about life in Silicon Valley,

1408
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:05,890
and parties at Stanford and down in LA,
and friends who'd become millionaires...

1409
01:09:06,010 --> 01:09:10,890
But mostly how Mark had to...
He had to come to California.

1410
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:14,140
And then he got around to The Facebook.

1411
01:09:14,230 --> 01:09:16,730
So, tell me about your progress.

1412
01:09:16,810 --> 01:09:20,400
Well, we're in 29 schools now.
We got over 75,000 members.

1413
01:09:20,570 --> 01:09:22,240
- Tell me about the strategy you're using.
- Okay.

1414
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,320
For instance, we wanted Baylor, in Texas,

1415
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:26,240
but Baylor already had
a social network on campus.

1416
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:27,910
So instead of going right after them,

1417
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:30,080
we made a list of every school
within 100 miles...

1418
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:31,240
You put The Facebook
on those campuses first.

1419
01:09:31,330 --> 01:09:34,160
Pretty soon all the Baylor kids saw
their friends on our site and we were in.

1420
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:35,580
It's called the Little Bighorn.
That's smart, Mark.

1421
01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:37,080
- Thanks, that was mine.
- Easy.

1422
01:09:37,170 --> 01:09:38,920
Hey, you know what?
Settle an argument for us.

1423
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:40,920
I say it's time to start making money
from The Facebook,

1424
01:09:41,050 --> 01:09:42,920
but Mark doesn't want advertising.
Who's right?

1425
01:09:43,010 --> 01:09:44,260
Well...

1426
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:46,180
Neither of you yet.

1427
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:48,600
The Facebook is cool,
that's what it's got going for it.

1428
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:49,760
Yeah.

1429
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:51,510
You don't wanna ruin it with ads
because ads aren't cool.

1430
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:52,680
Exactly.

1431
01:09:52,770 --> 01:09:54,270
It's like you're throwing
the greatest party on campus

1432
01:09:54,350 --> 01:09:55,600
and someone's saying
it's gotta be over by 11:00.

1433
01:09:55,730 --> 01:09:56,770
That's exactly right.

1434
01:09:56,850 --> 01:09:59,020
- You don't even know what the thing is yet.
- Exactly.

1435
01:09:59,110 --> 01:10:02,820
How big it can get, how far it can go.
This is no time to take your chips down.

1436
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:04,820
A million dollars isn't cool.
You know what's cool?

1437
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:05,950
You?

1438
01:10:08,740 --> 01:10:10,070
"A billion dollars."

1439
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:15,290
And that shut everybody up.

1440
01:10:15,370 --> 01:10:18,460
And that's where you're headed.
A billion-dollar valuation.

1441
01:10:19,210 --> 01:10:21,880
Unless you take bad advice, in which case
you may as well have come up with

1442
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:23,800
a chain of very successful yogurt shops.

1443
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:28,010
When you go fishing, you can catch
a lot of fish or you can catch a big fish.

1444
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:31,390
You ever walk into a guy's den and see
a picture of him standing next to 14 trout?

1445
01:10:31,470 --> 01:10:33,310
- No, he's holding a 3,000-pound marlin.
- Yep.

1446
01:10:33,390 --> 01:10:34,470
- That's a good analogy.
- Okay.

1447
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:36,940
But we all know marlins don't really
weigh 3,000 pounds, right?

1448
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:38,060
Have you seen the big ones up close?

1449
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:41,110
No, but I don't think the guy's holding
a marlin the size of a Range Rover.

1450
01:10:41,190 --> 01:10:43,820
That would be a really big fish
and a very strong guy.

1451
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:45,440
You think we might be getting away
from the point?

1452
01:10:45,530 --> 01:10:49,820
I don't have a dog in this fight.
I'm just a fan who came to say hi.

1453
01:10:49,910 --> 01:10:51,740
He owned Mark after that dinner.

1454
01:10:52,660 --> 01:10:55,040
He picked up the check,
he told Mark they'd talk again soon,

1455
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,200
and he was gone.

1456
01:10:56,290 --> 01:11:00,170
But not before he made his biggest
contribution to the company.

1457
01:11:02,540 --> 01:11:05,000
Drop the "The." Just "Facebook."

1458
01:11:05,590 --> 01:11:07,130
It's cleaner.

1459
01:11:10,050 --> 01:11:11,090
Shit.

1460
01:11:13,810 --> 01:11:14,850
Goodbye, sweetie.

1461
01:11:15,890 --> 01:11:17,100
Yeah.

1462
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:23,900
That's gotta be some kind of
land speed record for talking.

1463
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:26,150
You wanna end the party at 11:00.

1464
01:11:27,110 --> 01:11:30,360
- I'm trying to pay for the party.
- There won't be a party unless it's cool.

1465
01:11:31,570 --> 01:11:32,660
So, what do you think?

1466
01:11:32,740 --> 01:11:34,700
Yeah, sure, let's drop the "The."

1467
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:37,910
I meant to catching the marlin
instead of the 14 trout.

1468
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,290
Doesn't that sound good?

1469
01:11:39,370 --> 01:11:41,080
If you're a trout.

1470
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:42,710
I'm going to enter this into the record.

1471
01:11:42,790 --> 01:11:46,710
Incorporation papers for Facebook,
an LLC registered in Florida.

1472
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,880
- Why Florida?
- It's where my family lives.

1473
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:51,550
And ask the respondent to stipulate
that the articles of incorporation

1474
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:55,390
state the ownership as follows:
65% for Mark Zuckerberg,

1475
01:11:55,470 --> 01:11:58,600
30% for Eduardo Saverin
and 5% for Dustin Moskovitz.

1476
01:11:58,680 --> 01:11:59,770
Yeah, we stipulate.

1477
01:11:59,850 --> 01:12:02,730
- And that was April 13th, 2004.
- You can mark it.

1478
01:12:02,810 --> 01:12:04,440
You have anything here?

1479
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:05,820
Yes. Thank you.

1480
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:08,610
Mr. Saverin, have you ever done anything

1481
01:12:08,690 --> 01:12:11,280
that might be considered
legitimate grounds for termination?

1482
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,160
No.

1483
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:18,790
You never did anything to embarrass the
company or even seriously jeopardize it?

1484
01:12:19,410 --> 01:12:20,790
- No.
- No?

1485
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:25,420
No.

1486
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:27,670
You were accused of animal cruelty.

1487
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:31,720
- Wait.
- You weren't?

1488
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:34,050
This is not happening.

1489
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:36,470
I have here an article from The Crimson...

1490
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:37,640
Jesus Christ.

1491
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:38,770
I can't have this, Wardo.

1492
01:12:38,850 --> 01:12:42,310
Come on, man. This is bullshit.
This is another club playing a prank.

1493
01:12:43,850 --> 01:12:46,110
I'd gotten into the Phoenix.

1494
01:12:46,190 --> 01:12:48,820
I'd been accepted,
and as part of my initiation I had to,

1495
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:52,900
for one week, carry with me at all times
and take care of a chicken.

1496
01:12:52,990 --> 01:12:55,620
They identify you
as one of the founders of Facebook.

1497
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:57,080
"Junior Eduardo Saverin..."

1498
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:59,120
I'm not the expert, but being connected
to torturing animals

1499
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:00,540
is probably bad for business.

1500
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:05,460
I did not torture the chicken.
I don't torture chickens. Are you crazy?

1501
01:13:05,540 --> 01:13:09,380
No, and settle down, please.
I have here an article from The Crimson...

1502
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:11,260
- This is scathing.
- 956.

1503
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:14,180
I was having dinner in
the Kirkland dining hall with Mark,

1504
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:15,970
and I had the chicken with me,

1505
01:13:16,050 --> 01:13:18,050
because I had to have the chicken
with me at all times.

1506
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:19,220
This was college.

1507
01:13:19,310 --> 01:13:21,390
- Somebody's gonna have to answer for this.
- 969.

1508
01:13:21,850 --> 01:13:24,020
And the dining hall
was serving chicken for dinner,

1509
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:26,520
and I had to feed my chicken, so I...

1510
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:29,820
Well, I took little pieces of chicken
and I gave it to the chicken.

1511
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,070
Someone must have seen me,
because the next thing I knew

1512
01:13:32,150 --> 01:13:33,860
I was being accused of forced cannibalism.

1513
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:37,320
I didn't know you couldn't do that.

1514
01:13:37,740 --> 01:13:39,740
I dealt with the various animal rights groups,

1515
01:13:39,830 --> 01:13:42,040
I dealt with the associate dean
of the college.

1516
01:13:42,330 --> 01:13:44,000
This was all resolved.

1517
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:45,120
988.

1518
01:13:45,210 --> 01:13:47,250
Someone from the Porc or the Fly
must have reported it.

1519
01:13:47,330 --> 01:13:49,170
For all I know, it was the Winklevosses.

1520
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:50,960
All right, let's just forget about it.

1521
01:13:51,050 --> 01:13:54,010
This is absurd.
I'm being accused of animal cruelty.

1522
01:13:54,090 --> 01:13:55,550
It's better to be accused of necrophilia.

1523
01:13:55,630 --> 01:13:57,260
It is better to be accused of necrophilia.

1524
01:13:57,340 --> 01:14:00,720
Now I have to explain this to my father.
I'm gonna have to explain this to everybody.

1525
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:02,220
What is happening on that?

1526
01:14:02,310 --> 01:14:04,390
I have my final coming up
for Postwar and Contemporary Art

1527
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:05,730
and I haven't been to class.

1528
01:14:05,810 --> 01:14:07,060
I'm supposed to write about
these four paintings.

1529
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:08,770
That's a Facebook page?

1530
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:09,900
Yeah. I opened it under an alias.

1531
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:11,400
I posted the paintings
and asked people to comment.

1532
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:14,490
Every once in a while, I hop on
and stir the pot to get a good debate going.

1533
01:14:14,570 --> 01:14:16,990
Mr. Zuckerberg was cheating
on his final exam?

1534
01:14:17,070 --> 01:14:19,870
- I'd rather not answer that, Gretchen.
- And why not?

1535
01:14:19,950 --> 01:14:22,700
Because I'm not suing him
for cheating on his final exam.

1536
01:14:22,790 --> 01:14:25,960
- That's not what friends do.
- Well, you just told us he was cheating.

1537
01:14:26,870 --> 01:14:27,920
Oops.

1538
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:32,210
You told your lawyers
I was torturing animals?

1539
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:33,920
No, he didn't tell us about it at all.

1540
01:14:34,010 --> 01:14:36,760
Our litigators are capable
of finding a Crimson article.

1541
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:39,550
In fact, when we raised the subject with him,
he defended you.

1542
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:43,060
Oops.

1543
01:14:43,470 --> 01:14:45,520
993. We are so close.

1544
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:49,310
Yeah, that reminds me,
we're gonna need more money, Wardo.

1545
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:51,440
Yeah, no, I agree. More servers, more help.

1546
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,270
I'm interviewing two interns
to come to Palo Alto

1547
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:54,440
and we're gonna have
to pay them something.

1548
01:14:54,530 --> 01:14:56,490
- Sorry, what?
- I already found a house for rent

1549
01:14:56,570 --> 01:14:58,320
on a street
two blocks from the Stanford campus.

1550
01:14:58,410 --> 01:14:59,740
It is perfect and it's got a pool.

1551
01:14:59,820 --> 01:15:01,820
When did you decide to go to California
for the summer?

1552
01:15:01,910 --> 01:15:03,160
You mean when did I actually decide?

1553
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:06,410
Was it somewhere in the middle
of the Sean Parker Variety Hour?

1554
01:15:06,830 --> 01:15:09,040
He was right,
California's the place we've gotta be.

1555
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:10,540
What, you're Jed Clampett?

1556
01:15:10,630 --> 01:15:12,670
I didn't know you guys
got The Beverly Hillbillies in Brazil.

1557
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:14,420
Yeah, got the show in Brazil, it was genius.

1558
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:17,840
- What is your problem with Sean?
- He doesn't bring anything to the table.

1559
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:19,970
He doesn't have money.
Dustin's a better programmer.

1560
01:15:20,050 --> 01:15:23,640
- He's got connections to VCs.
- We don't need VCs, we need advertisers.

1561
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:25,640
- And I have connections to VCs.
- No real players.

1562
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:28,310
And as somebody who's just really
embarrassed the company in a bad way...

1563
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:30,600
- It was the Winklevosses, Mark.
- Hang on.

1564
01:15:30,690 --> 01:15:32,150
Hit "Refresh."

1565
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:35,980
150,004.

1566
01:15:36,070 --> 01:15:38,440
150,000 members, Wardo.

1567
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:40,150
- Congratulations, dude.
- Congratulations.

1568
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:44,700
You don't think it was strange that
he was followed by private detectives?

1569
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:46,450
Who came up with nothing.

1570
01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:48,500
Enough to get him out of the company.
The drugs, the girls.

1571
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:50,710
- We don't know that any of that's true.
- You can read about it.

1572
01:15:50,790 --> 01:15:52,330
I can read about you torturing birds.
Since when...

1573
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:56,090
Okay, don't fish eat other fish?
The marlins and the trout?

1574
01:15:58,590 --> 01:15:59,630
What's he talking about?

1575
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:02,390
I'm interviewing interns at 10:00
tomorrow night in the CS lab.

1576
01:16:02,470 --> 01:16:03,640
Get on board with this, man.

1577
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:06,260
You know, I don't really know
what else to say.

1578
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:32,000
You can do one more! One more!

1579
01:16:36,710 --> 01:16:37,750
Wardo!

1580
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,130
Yo! Mark!

1581
01:16:41,050 --> 01:16:42,090
What's going on?

1582
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:44,550
They have 10 minutes to get root access
to a Python web server,

1583
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:45,930
expose its SSL encryption,

1584
01:16:46,010 --> 01:16:47,640
and then intercept all traffic
over its secure port.

1585
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:48,810
They're hacking.

1586
01:16:48,930 --> 01:16:50,930
Yes, all behind a Pix Firewall Emulator.
But here's the beauty.

1587
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:52,850
You know I didn't understand
anything you just said, right?

1588
01:16:52,940 --> 01:16:54,060
- I do know that.
- So what's the beauty?

1589
01:16:54,150 --> 01:16:56,060
Every tenth line of code written,
they have to drink a shot.

1590
01:16:56,150 --> 01:16:59,150
Hacking's supposed to be stealth,
so every time the server detects an intrusion,

1591
01:16:59,230 --> 01:17:01,070
the candidate responsible
has to drink a shot.

1592
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:02,860
I also have a program running
that has a pop-up window

1593
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:04,780
appear simultaneously on all five computers.

1594
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:06,870
The last candidate to hit the window
has to drink a shot.

1595
01:17:06,950 --> 01:17:09,080
Plus, every three minutes
they all have to drink a shot.

1596
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:11,620
- Three minutes!
- Drink one now!

1597
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:15,330
Hey, can I ask, what part of the intern's job
will they need to be able to do drunk?

1598
01:17:15,420 --> 01:17:16,460
You're right.

1599
01:17:16,540 --> 01:17:19,840
A more relevant test might be seeing
if they can keep a chicken alive for a week.

1600
01:17:21,630 --> 01:17:23,550
- That was mean.
- Here.

1601
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:24,760
What is this?

1602
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:27,930
I opened a new account
and put $18,000 in it.

1603
01:17:29,390 --> 01:17:31,270
Will that get you through the summer?

1604
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:32,390
- Here!
- Mark?

1605
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:33,890
Right here!

1606
01:17:39,070 --> 01:17:40,900
Welcome to Facebook.

1607
01:17:50,290 --> 01:17:51,990
- $18,000?
- Yes.

1608
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:54,410
In addition to the $1,000
you'd already put up.

1609
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:57,080
- Yes.
- A total of $19,000 now.

1610
01:17:57,170 --> 01:17:58,420
- Yes.
- Hang on.

1611
01:18:00,590 --> 01:18:02,050
I'm just checking your math on that.

1612
01:18:02,130 --> 01:18:04,470
Yes, I got the same thing.

1613
01:18:05,050 --> 01:18:06,130
May I continue?

1614
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:09,640
After expressing misgivings
about Mr. Zuckerberg taking the company

1615
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:11,760
and moving it to California for the summer,

1616
01:18:11,850 --> 01:18:14,850
why did you put $18,000
in an account for his use?

1617
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:18,690
I figured we were partners.
I wanted to be a team player.

1618
01:18:18,770 --> 01:18:21,860
I figured Mark, Dustin and the new interns
could work on the site

1619
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:24,400
while I was generating
advertiser interest in New York.

1620
01:18:24,490 --> 01:18:29,030
But mostly I figured, how much could
possibly go wrong in three months?

1621
01:18:30,830 --> 01:18:32,620
Go, go, go, go, go.

1622
01:18:37,210 --> 01:18:38,830
- I didn't die.
- I know.

1623
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:40,750
- I made it.
- You did.

1624
01:18:42,170 --> 01:18:43,500
Okay, ready?

1625
01:18:43,590 --> 01:18:45,840
- That was like an 8.
- That was like a 2.

1626
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:48,300
- It was better than that.
- Yeah.

1627
01:18:56,980 --> 01:18:58,020
I'm okay.

1628
01:18:58,100 --> 01:18:59,350
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1629
01:18:59,980 --> 01:19:01,060
Yikes.

1630
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:03,820
That's the doorbell.

1631
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:05,110
I didn't know we had a doorbell.

1632
01:19:05,190 --> 01:19:07,900
- Andrew, get the door!
- No, he's wired in.

1633
01:19:07,990 --> 01:19:09,990
That's gonna cut into your security deposit.

1634
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,160
- Andrew.
- Not now.

1635
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:14,580
Good boy.

1636
01:19:18,710 --> 01:19:20,040
- Sean?
- Mark?

1637
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:22,080
- Do you live here?
- Yeah.

1638
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:23,420
Do you?

1639
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:25,050
We were right across the street.
We saw the chimney...

1640
01:19:25,130 --> 01:19:27,720
- Is anybody hurt?
- No. You live across the street?

1641
01:19:29,130 --> 01:19:30,300
I'm Sharon.

1642
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:32,720
This is my... Sharon.
She lives across the street.

1643
01:19:32,850 --> 01:19:34,140
I was helping her move out,
we saw the chimney...

1644
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:36,180
We had a zip line to the pool.

1645
01:19:37,060 --> 01:19:39,520
You came to California.

1646
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:41,020
Yeah.

1647
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:43,230
You made the right choice.

1648
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:50,200
Here you go.

1649
01:19:54,870 --> 01:19:55,910
Sharon?

1650
01:19:58,370 --> 01:19:59,370
I'm so sorry.

1651
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:00,500
- No problem.
- I didn't know you were gonna...

1652
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:02,630
- Here you go.
- No, no, no. Wait!

1653
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:08,090
This house and this team are great.
It's exactly what it should be.

1654
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:10,220
I'm Sean Parker.

1655
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:11,430
Oh, he's wired in.

1656
01:20:11,970 --> 01:20:13,640
That's what I'm talking about.

1657
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:16,350
Where's Eduardo?

1658
01:20:16,430 --> 01:20:18,930
He got an internship in New York.

1659
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:20,980
Eduardo didn't come out?

1660
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:44,290
I was crashing there for a little bit
while I'm taking care of some things,

1661
01:20:44,420 --> 01:20:47,840
but she's done for the summer
so she's back at her parents' place.

1662
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:51,380
- The homeless rock star of Palo Alto.
- All right.

1663
01:20:51,470 --> 01:20:53,930
What's your plan for the summer?

1664
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:56,300
Mark?

1665
01:20:56,930 --> 01:20:59,100
I'm sorry. I was looking at the architecture.

1666
01:21:00,430 --> 01:21:01,770
I asked what your plan for the...

1667
01:21:01,850 --> 01:21:03,350
A hundred schools
by the end of the summer.

1668
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:05,190
- We're gonna go to the restroom.
- Okay.

1669
01:21:05,310 --> 01:21:07,310
Yeah, I'll go with you.

1670
01:21:10,940 --> 01:21:12,440
Your date looks so familiar to me.

1671
01:21:12,530 --> 01:21:14,110
She looks familiar to a lot of people.

1672
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:15,450
What do you mean?

1673
01:21:17,450 --> 01:21:20,830
A Stanford MBA named Roy Raymond
wants to buy his wife some lingerie,

1674
01:21:20,950 --> 01:21:23,750
but he's too embarrassed
to shop for it in a department store.

1675
01:21:23,830 --> 01:21:25,670
He comes up with an idea
for a high-end place

1676
01:21:25,790 --> 01:21:28,090
that doesn't make you feel like a pervert.

1677
01:21:28,170 --> 01:21:32,170
He gets a $40,000 bank loan,
borrows another 40,000 from his in-laws,

1678
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:35,260
opens a store and calls it Victoria's Secret.

1679
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:38,050
Makes a half million dollars his first year.

1680
01:21:38,140 --> 01:21:41,970
Starts a catalog, opens three more stores,
and after five years, he sells the company

1681
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:45,310
to Leslie Wexner and The Limited
for $4 million.

1682
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:46,650
Happy ending, right?

1683
01:21:47,190 --> 01:21:51,440
Except two years later,
the company's worth $500 million,

1684
01:21:51,530 --> 01:21:54,820
and Roy Raymond jumps off
the Golden Gate Bridge.

1685
01:21:57,030 --> 01:22:00,830
Poor guy just wanted to buy his wife
a pair of thigh-highs, you know?

1686
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,410
Was that a parable?

1687
01:22:04,210 --> 01:22:08,420
My date's a Victoria's Secret model.
That's why she looks familiar to you.

1688
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:09,960
- God.
- Don't be impressed by all this.

1689
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:11,300
I read your blog.

1690
01:22:11,380 --> 01:22:13,420
You know, no, that was for web cretins.

1691
01:22:13,510 --> 01:22:15,170
You know why I started Napster?

1692
01:22:16,340 --> 01:22:21,140
The girl I loved in high school was with
the co-captain of the varsity lacrosse team,

1693
01:22:21,220 --> 01:22:23,270
and I wanted to take her from him.

1694
01:22:23,350 --> 01:22:25,270
So I decided to come up with
the next big thing.

1695
01:22:25,690 --> 01:22:28,230
- I didn't know that.
- Napster wasn't a failure.

1696
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:31,770
I changed the music industry
for better and for always.

1697
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:36,110
It may not have been good business,
but it pissed a lot of people off.

1698
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:38,660
And isn't that what your Facemash
was about?

1699
01:22:38,740 --> 01:22:41,410
They're scared of me, pal,
and they're gonna be scared of you.

1700
01:22:41,530 --> 01:22:43,290
What the VCs want is to say,

1701
01:22:43,370 --> 01:22:46,210
"Good idea, kid,
the grown-ups will take it from here."

1702
01:22:46,290 --> 01:22:48,920
But not this time. This is our time.

1703
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:52,840
This time, you're gonna hand them
a business card that says,

1704
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:54,630
"I'm CEO, bitch."

1705
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:57,720
That's what I want for you.

1706
01:22:58,430 --> 01:23:00,050
So where the hell is Eduardo?

1707
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:03,680
- He's in New York.
- Sucking up to ad execs.

1708
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:05,720
- He's got an...
- An internship.

1709
01:23:06,890 --> 01:23:10,400
The company's here.
A billion-dollar company's here.

1710
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:13,360
- Do you live and breathe Facebook?
- Yes.

1711
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:14,570
I know you do.

1712
01:23:14,650 --> 01:23:17,740
Wardo wants to be a businessman
and for all I know he's gonna be a good one,

1713
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:20,570
but he shouldn't be in New York
kissing Madison Avenue's ass.

1714
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:25,740
This is a once-in-a-generation,
"holy shit" idea.

1715
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:29,750
And the water under
the Golden Gate is freezing cold.

1716
01:23:31,460 --> 01:23:35,590
Look at my face and tell me
I don't know what I'm talking about.

1717
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:38,840
Do you ever think about that girl?

1718
01:23:38,930 --> 01:23:39,970
What girl?

1719
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:43,430
The girl from high school
with the lacrosse thing.

1720
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:45,760
No.

1721
01:23:45,850 --> 01:23:49,390
If you guys are gonna talk about bandwidth,
we need shots.

1722
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:50,980
A hundred schools
by the end of the summer?

1723
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:52,100
Yeah.

1724
01:23:52,190 --> 01:23:53,560
Tell you what. Gesture of good faith.

1725
01:23:53,650 --> 01:23:58,110
While you're getting into 100 schools,
I'll put you on two continents.

1726
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:00,360
Two...

1727
01:24:04,830 --> 01:24:06,290
If you don't have a place to crash,

1728
01:24:06,370 --> 01:24:08,660
I think you should definitely
come and live with us.

1729
01:24:09,620 --> 01:24:11,540
Let's line up some shots.

1730
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:13,750
- Excuse me!
- Yes, sir.

1731
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:16,960
You can take this away
and bring back the 1942.

1732
01:24:17,050 --> 01:24:18,960
Absolutely, Mr. Parker.

1733
01:24:35,150 --> 01:24:38,150
Attention... Go!

1734
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:59,510
At the barrier, Hollandia is
leading Harvard University by one length.

1735
01:25:09,350 --> 01:25:10,520
Approaching the grandstands,

1736
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:13,730
Hollandia maintains a lead
of three-quarters of a length.

1737
01:25:26,950 --> 01:25:28,200
Come on!

1738
01:26:06,870 --> 01:26:08,200
Whatever.

1739
01:26:13,870 --> 01:26:14,910
- Mr. Winklevoss.
- Tyler.

1740
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:16,870
- Tremendous race.
- Thank you.

1741
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:19,210
- And this is my brother, Cameron.
- Excellent.

1742
01:26:19,290 --> 01:26:20,340
Sir?

1743
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:22,130
His Royal Highness Prince Albert.

1744
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:24,010
Your Highness, this is
Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.

1745
01:26:24,090 --> 01:26:27,430
Of course. Brilliant race.
I've never seen a race that close.

1746
01:26:27,550 --> 01:26:28,550
Yes, Your Highness.

1747
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:31,680
My grandfather, Jack Kelly,
was one of the premier rowers of his day.

1748
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:35,230
I've been coming to Henley for 30 years
and I'd never seen a race that close.

1749
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,230
Have you? Have you seen a race that close?

1750
01:26:37,310 --> 01:26:38,400
No, Your Highness.

1751
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:40,860
Mile-and-a-half races are more
commonly won by a boat length or two.

1752
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:43,730
Yes, that's absolutely right. Brutally close.

1753
01:26:43,940 --> 01:26:44,990
May I introduce my teammates?

1754
01:26:45,110 --> 01:26:47,030
I'm sorry. You'll have to excuse us.

1755
01:26:47,110 --> 01:26:48,780
On to the Dutch.

1756
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:53,660
Sorry you flew all the way out here
to see that.

1757
01:26:53,790 --> 01:26:55,910
Wouldn't have missed it, brother.
How was the royalty?

1758
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,620
I just wanted him to tell me
a couple more times how close the race was.

1759
01:26:58,750 --> 01:27:02,250
Just brutal, brutally close.
Brutally excruciating. Jesus.

1760
01:27:02,340 --> 01:27:04,000
The guy is the prince of a country
the size of Nantucket.

1761
01:27:04,130 --> 01:27:05,130
Relax, it's fine.

1762
01:27:05,260 --> 01:27:06,420
- Boys. Divya.
- Dad.

1763
01:27:06,510 --> 01:27:08,550
- Mr. Winklevoss.
- That was a tough beat.

1764
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,720
I'm sorry that you and Mom
had to fly out here to see that.

1765
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,640
No, don't ever apologize to me
for losing a race like that.

1766
01:27:13,010 --> 01:27:15,640
Don't ever apologize to anyone
for losing a race like that.

1767
01:27:15,770 --> 01:27:17,600
- Boys.
- Mr. Kenwright.

1768
01:27:18,270 --> 01:27:20,940
Dad, this is Mr. Kenwright,
head of the host family for this week.

1769
01:27:21,020 --> 01:27:22,770
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

1770
01:27:22,860 --> 01:27:24,270
I've just had a phone chat with my daughter.

1771
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:27,320
She told me that she and her friends
are already talking about the race,

1772
01:27:27,450 --> 01:27:29,700
which they've just seen via their computers.

1773
01:27:29,820 --> 01:27:33,660
A new website called Facebook.
Do you have this in America?

1774
01:27:34,990 --> 01:27:37,160
I'm gonna find your mother.

1775
01:27:38,710 --> 01:27:39,750
Have I said something wrong?

1776
01:27:39,830 --> 01:27:41,710
Your daughter doesn't go
to school in the States?

1777
01:27:41,830 --> 01:27:43,130
No, no. Cambridge.

1778
01:27:43,210 --> 01:27:45,960
Majoring in French literature, though
I wasn't aware there was such a thing.

1779
01:27:46,050 --> 01:27:47,130
And they have Facebook at Cambridge?

1780
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:49,300
And apparently Oxford and
the London School of Economics.

1781
01:27:49,380 --> 01:27:50,470
That's where her friends are.

1782
01:27:51,050 --> 01:27:52,550
That's awesome.

1783
01:27:53,010 --> 01:27:56,520
Good race, boys.
Take the bitter with the better, eh?

1784
01:27:58,850 --> 01:28:00,230
I'm gonna go watch the race film.

1785
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:05,860
If this is online, I wanna see it.

1786
01:28:05,980 --> 01:28:07,320
Stop it.

1787
01:28:07,860 --> 01:28:09,360
Stop it, Cam.

1788
01:28:09,740 --> 01:28:11,240
Knock it off.

1789
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:14,370
I don't mind that we lost
to the Dutch today by less than a second.

1790
01:28:14,490 --> 01:28:16,660
That was a good race,
and that was a fair race.

1791
01:28:16,740 --> 01:28:18,200
And they'll see us again.

1792
01:28:18,330 --> 01:28:20,460
What I mind, and what you should mind,

1793
01:28:20,540 --> 01:28:23,710
is showing up on Monday
for a race that was run on Sunday.

1794
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:26,170
We tried talking to him ourselves,
we tried writing a letter,

1795
01:28:26,250 --> 01:28:29,840
we tried the Ad Board, and we tried
talking to the president of the university.

1796
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:32,430
Now, I am asking you for the last time,

1797
01:28:32,550 --> 01:28:37,720
let's take the considerable resources
at our disposal and sue him in federal court.

1798
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:39,430
Come on.

1799
01:28:40,850 --> 01:28:42,690
I need a real drink.

1800
01:28:49,570 --> 01:28:50,570
Screw it.

1801
01:28:52,030 --> 01:28:54,240
Let's gut the frigging nerd.

1802
01:28:57,080 --> 01:28:58,410
That's what I'm talking about!

1803
01:28:58,580 --> 01:29:00,410
No, no, no, no, no.

1804
01:29:00,580 --> 01:29:02,830
But check it out, I saw him today.

1805
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:05,330
Manningham, Mitchell Manningham,
my Case Equity guy.

1806
01:29:05,420 --> 01:29:06,500
Hang on.

1807
01:29:06,590 --> 01:29:08,250
Are you guys using Spikes
or Ghost Missiles?

1808
01:29:08,340 --> 01:29:10,010
We don't know,
we're just shooting at each other.

1809
01:29:10,090 --> 01:29:11,510
Use Sweet Kamikazes.

1810
01:29:11,590 --> 01:29:13,720
Like we know what that is.

1811
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:18,010
I saw him getting into his Turbo Carrera
and he saw me, too.

1812
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:19,680
I know he did.

1813
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:25,060
Don't. Don't sweat it. I'm on a landline.

1814
01:29:25,230 --> 01:29:26,560
Bong hit.

1815
01:29:27,270 --> 01:29:28,770
Does anybody hear that banging?

1816
01:29:28,860 --> 01:29:31,280
You don't hear anything.
You're writing code.

1817
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:33,360
Dude, somebody's at the door.

1818
01:29:33,450 --> 01:29:38,030
It's not a dish best served cold.
It's best served immediately and relentlessly.

1819
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:43,580
I'm gonna call you back.

1820
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:48,090
What's up?

1821
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:51,550
Mark was supposed to pick me up
at the airport an hour ago.

1822
01:29:51,630 --> 01:29:53,220
I've been calling his cell.

1823
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:57,800
He was on a 36-hour coding tear,
so he took a nap for a couple of hours.

1824
01:30:04,060 --> 01:30:05,140
What happened here?

1825
01:30:05,270 --> 01:30:08,730
Not happened. Happening.
The next big thing.

1826
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:09,980
Wardo.

1827
01:30:10,070 --> 01:30:11,070
Hey, man.

1828
01:30:11,150 --> 01:30:13,150
- Back to work.
- Okay.

1829
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:16,150
The more bad I get at this,
the more wasted I get.

1830
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:17,780
I mean the more wasted that I get...

1831
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:19,570
We understand.

1832
01:30:21,950 --> 01:30:23,080
How old are they, Sean?

1833
01:30:23,660 --> 01:30:25,000
It's not polite to ask.

1834
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:26,250
Sean, how old are they?

1835
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:28,830
You think you know me, right?

1836
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:30,170
I've read enough.

1837
01:30:30,290 --> 01:30:32,630
You know how much I've read about you?

1838
01:30:33,170 --> 01:30:34,510
Nothing.

1839
01:30:38,340 --> 01:30:40,100
- Wardo.
- Hey, man.

1840
01:30:40,180 --> 01:30:43,100
- I waited an hour for you at the airport.
- What time is it?

1841
01:30:43,180 --> 01:30:46,520
It's midnight. Or 3:00 a.m. In New York,
where I just came from.

1842
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:50,270
You gotta see some of the new stuff we got.
Hey, Dustin. Show him the Wall.

1843
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:51,440
I'm just calling it the Wall.

1844
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:54,110
Forget the Wall, tell him about
the meeting I've got set up.

1845
01:30:54,190 --> 01:30:55,780
You know Peter Thiel?

1846
01:30:55,860 --> 01:30:57,200
- Nope.
- No reason you should.

1847
01:30:57,280 --> 01:31:00,530
He just runs a $2-billion hedge fund
called Clarium Capital.

1848
01:31:02,030 --> 01:31:03,620
Why's he setting up meetings?

1849
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:04,790
Thiel might wanna make
an angel investment.

1850
01:31:04,870 --> 01:31:07,960
I don't care if he's an actual angel.
Why is he setting up business meetings?

1851
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:10,710
- You've had a long flight.
- No, I had a long wait on the tarmac at JFK,

1852
01:31:10,790 --> 01:31:13,040
then a long wait at the passenger
loading and unloading zone at SFO,

1853
01:31:13,170 --> 01:31:15,050
and in between there was a long flight.

1854
01:31:15,170 --> 01:31:16,880
I'm the business end of this company.

1855
01:31:17,630 --> 01:31:20,050
And he is a houseguest living here rent free

1856
01:31:20,180 --> 01:31:23,050
on a very generous grant
from the Eduardo Saverin Foundation.

1857
01:31:23,180 --> 01:31:26,480
I heard about your big-ticket ad buys.
Gary's Tuxedos.

1858
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:28,230
- Hey, man...
- Harvard Bartending Course.

1859
01:31:28,310 --> 01:31:31,520
You're just a small step away
from bagging Snookies Cookies, I can feel it.

1860
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:42,990
- You wanna talk to me alone for a minute?
- Sure.

1861
01:31:47,330 --> 01:31:48,660
Bong hit.

1862
01:31:48,750 --> 01:31:51,040
- I'm so high.
- No, you're not.

1863
01:31:51,580 --> 01:31:53,340
So how's it going?

1864
01:31:53,670 --> 01:31:56,340
How's the internship? How's Christy?

1865
01:31:57,340 --> 01:31:59,670
- How's the internship?
- Yeah.

1866
01:32:01,220 --> 01:32:03,180
Mark, Jesus, I quit the internship.

1867
01:32:03,260 --> 01:32:05,760
We talked about this on the phone.
I quit on my first day.

1868
01:32:07,390 --> 01:32:09,770
I do remember you saying that.

1869
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:11,730
So how is Christy?

1870
01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:13,770
Christy's crazy.

1871
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:15,770
- Is that fun?
- No.

1872
01:32:15,860 --> 01:32:16,860
I mean, she's actually psychotic.

1873
01:32:16,940 --> 01:32:22,110
She's insanely jealous, she's irrational,
and I'm frightened of her.

1874
01:32:22,780 --> 01:32:24,070
Still, it's nice you have a girlfriend.

1875
01:32:27,620 --> 01:32:31,710
I do not want that guy representing
himself as part of this company.

1876
01:32:31,790 --> 01:32:33,960
You gotta move out here, Wardo,
this is where it's all happening.

1877
01:32:34,040 --> 01:32:36,040
- Did you hear what I just said?
- The connections, the energy...

1878
01:32:36,130 --> 01:32:37,130
Mark, you got...

1879
01:32:37,260 --> 01:32:39,800
I'm afraid if you don't come out here,
you're gonna get left behind.

1880
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:42,220
I want... I need you out here.

1881
01:32:42,300 --> 01:32:44,220
- Please don't tell him I said that.
- What did you just say?

1882
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:46,390
It's moving faster than any of us
ever imagined it would.

1883
01:32:46,470 --> 01:32:48,220
- It's moving fast.
- What did you mean?

1884
01:32:48,310 --> 01:32:50,230
- And Sean thinks we have...
- Sean is not part of this company.

1885
01:32:50,310 --> 01:32:51,390
We have over 300,000 members, Wardo,

1886
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:53,650
and we're in 160 schools,
including five in Europe.

1887
01:32:53,730 --> 01:32:55,230
I'm aware of that! Mark, I am the CFO!

1888
01:32:55,310 --> 01:32:56,730
We need more servers
than I ever expected we'd need.

1889
01:32:56,820 --> 01:32:58,400
We need more programmers
and we need more money,

1890
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:00,990
and he set up the Thiel meeting.
He set up meetings all over town.

1891
01:33:01,110 --> 01:33:02,320
- He set up other meetings?
- Yes.

1892
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:04,160
- Without me knowing anything about it.
- You're in New York.

1893
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:08,160
I'm in New York riding subways
14 hours a day, trying to find advertisers!

1894
01:33:08,290 --> 01:33:09,950
And how's it going so far?

1895
01:33:14,420 --> 01:33:16,920
What did you mean, "get left behind"?

1896
01:33:21,630 --> 01:33:23,010
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

1897
01:33:23,090 --> 01:33:24,590
I'd like to freeze this bank account

1898
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:28,140
and cancel all existing checks
and lines of credit.

1899
01:33:29,470 --> 01:33:32,640
- May I see some ID, please?
- Yeah, sure, sorry.

1900
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:40,690
Sean, he'll be right with you.

1901
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:42,190
No problem.

1902
01:33:44,030 --> 01:33:46,280
You know this is where
they filmed Towering Inferno?

1903
01:33:46,370 --> 01:33:48,120
That's comforting.

1904
01:33:49,540 --> 01:33:51,290
Hey, guys. Come on back.

1905
01:33:52,790 --> 01:33:55,040
- She offer you some waters?
- Oh, yeah. We're cool.

1906
01:33:56,630 --> 01:33:57,880
Sean, how are you? Come on in.

1907
01:33:57,960 --> 01:33:59,880
- You must be Mark.
- Hi.

1908
01:34:01,670 --> 01:34:05,010
We took a look at everything,
and congratulations.

1909
01:34:05,130 --> 01:34:08,640
We're gonna start you off
with a $500,000 investment.

1910
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:12,720
Maurice is gonna talk to you
about some corporate restructuring.

1911
01:34:12,850 --> 01:34:14,890
We'll file as a corporation in Delaware

1912
01:34:14,980 --> 01:34:17,900
and come up with a stock structure
that allows for new investors.

1913
01:34:17,980 --> 01:34:20,320
Now, let me ask you something.

1914
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:22,400
Who's Eduardo Saverin?

1915
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:44,010
Jesus Christ.

1916
01:34:47,590 --> 01:34:48,680
When did you get back?

1917
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:50,180
You scared me. I need you to knock.

1918
01:34:50,260 --> 01:34:52,180
When did you get back?

1919
01:34:53,270 --> 01:34:54,930
I got back this afternoon.

1920
01:34:55,060 --> 01:34:56,520
And when were you gonna call me?

1921
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:59,270
Chris, it was kind of a rough trip
and I was tired...

1922
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:03,270
Yeah, or answer one of my 47 texts.
Did you know I sent 47 texts?

1923
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:07,240
I did, and I thought that was
incredibly normal behavior.

1924
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:08,860
Are you mocking me?

1925
01:35:09,070 --> 01:35:10,280
I brought you a present.

1926
01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:14,950
Why does your Status say "single"
on your Facebook page?

1927
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:16,120
What?

1928
01:35:16,210 --> 01:35:20,130
Why does your Relationship Status
say "single" on your Facebook page?

1929
01:35:20,210 --> 01:35:21,880
Well, I was single when I set up the page.

1930
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:24,050
And you just never bothered to change it?

1931
01:35:24,130 --> 01:35:25,210
What?

1932
01:35:25,420 --> 01:35:26,880
I don't know how.

1933
01:35:26,970 --> 01:35:28,800
Do I look stupid to you?

1934
01:35:28,930 --> 01:35:30,220
No, calm down.

1935
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:32,550
You're asking me to believe
that the CFO of Facebook

1936
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:34,890
doesn't know how to change
his Relationship Status on Facebook?

1937
01:35:34,970 --> 01:35:38,310
It's embarrassing, so you should take it
as a sign of trust that I would tell you that.

1938
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:39,640
- Go to hell.
- Take it easy.

1939
01:35:39,770 --> 01:35:42,810
No, you didn't change it so you could
screw those Silicon Valley sluts

1940
01:35:42,900 --> 01:35:44,070
every time you go out to see Mark.

1941
01:35:44,150 --> 01:35:47,150
Not even remotely true, and I can
promise you that the Silicon Valley sluts

1942
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:50,160
don't care what anyone's
Relationship Status is on Facebook.

1943
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:51,660
Please, open your present.

1944
01:35:51,780 --> 01:35:53,660
Your phone does work.

1945
01:35:54,620 --> 01:35:55,740
It's Mark.

1946
01:35:55,830 --> 01:35:58,000
Okay, this is gonna be tricky.

1947
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:00,580
Open your present. It's a silk scarf.

1948
01:36:00,670 --> 01:36:02,330
Have you ever seen me wear a scarf?

1949
01:36:02,750 --> 01:36:04,590
This'll be your first.

1950
01:36:04,670 --> 01:36:05,750
Yeah.

1951
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:07,090
- You froze our account?
- I did.

1952
01:36:07,170 --> 01:36:09,420
- You froze the account.
- I had to get your attention, Mark.

1953
01:36:09,510 --> 01:36:11,260
Do you realize that you jeopardized
the entire company?

1954
01:36:11,340 --> 01:36:12,930
Do you realize that your actions
could have destroyed

1955
01:36:13,010 --> 01:36:14,010
everything I've been working on?

1956
01:36:14,140 --> 01:36:15,180
We have been working on.

1957
01:36:15,260 --> 01:36:16,770
Without money, the site can't function.

1958
01:36:16,850 --> 01:36:19,100
Let me tell you the difference
between Facebook and everybody else.

1959
01:36:19,190 --> 01:36:20,270
We don't crash ever!

1960
01:36:20,350 --> 01:36:24,020
If the servers are down for even a day, our
entire reputation is irreversibly destroyed.

1961
01:36:24,110 --> 01:36:26,110
- Look...
- Users are fickle. Friendster has proved that.

1962
01:36:26,190 --> 01:36:28,940
Even a few people leaving would reverberate
through the entire user base.

1963
01:36:29,030 --> 01:36:31,360
The users are interconnected.
That is the whole point.

1964
01:36:31,450 --> 01:36:33,200
College kids are online
because their friends are online

1965
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:35,450
and if one domino goes,
the other dominos go.

1966
01:36:35,530 --> 01:36:36,620
Don't you get that?

1967
01:36:36,700 --> 01:36:38,330
I am not going back to
the Caribbean Night at A-E-Pi!

1968
01:36:40,330 --> 01:36:41,710
Holy shit.

1969
01:36:44,540 --> 01:36:45,880
What is wrong with you?

1970
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,460
Did you like being nobody?

1971
01:36:47,550 --> 01:36:49,300
Did you like being a joke?
Do you wanna go back to that?

1972
01:36:49,380 --> 01:36:50,800
Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.

1973
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:52,220
That was the act of a child,
not a businessman,

1974
01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:53,720
and it certainly was not the act of a friend.

1975
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:56,390
You know how embarrassing it was for me
to try to cash a check today?

1976
01:36:56,470 --> 01:36:57,720
I am not going back to that life.

1977
01:36:57,850 --> 01:37:00,230
- Maybe you were frustrated.
- Yeah!

1978
01:37:00,390 --> 01:37:02,690
- Maybe you were angry.
- I was!

1979
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:05,230
But I am willing to let bygones be bygones,

1980
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:07,650
because, Wardo, I've got some good news.

1981
01:37:07,730 --> 01:37:08,900
I'm sorry.

1982
01:37:08,980 --> 01:37:13,740
I was angry, and maybe it was childish,
but I had to get your attention.

1983
01:37:13,860 --> 01:37:16,660
Wardo, I said I've got some good news.

1984
01:37:17,080 --> 01:37:18,080
What is it?

1985
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:20,750
Peter Thiel just made an angel investment
of half a million dollars.

1986
01:37:20,830 --> 01:37:22,000
What?

1987
01:37:22,210 --> 01:37:26,170
Half a million dollars.
And he's setting us up in an office.

1988
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:29,420
They wanna reincorporate the company.
They wanna meet you.

1989
01:37:29,550 --> 01:37:31,010
They need your signature
on some documents,

1990
01:37:31,090 --> 01:37:33,510
so you gotta get your ass
on the first flight back to San Francisco.

1991
01:37:33,590 --> 01:37:35,180
I need my CFO.

1992
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:41,180
I'm on my way.

1993
01:37:41,270 --> 01:37:42,770
- Wardo?
- Yeah?

1994
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:44,390
We did it.

1995
01:37:47,730 --> 01:37:48,940
Wardo?

1996
01:37:49,530 --> 01:37:51,440
You're going back there already?

1997
01:37:51,570 --> 01:37:52,690
Yes.

1998
01:37:54,450 --> 01:37:56,610
And also, I'm breaking up with you.

1999
01:38:00,450 --> 01:38:02,250
Somebody stop her!

2000
01:38:04,750 --> 01:38:05,790
Four documents.

2001
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:07,790
The first two are common stock
purchase agreements,

2002
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:10,960
allowing you to buy stock
in the newly reincorporated Facebook,

2003
01:38:11,050 --> 01:38:14,470
as opposed to the old shares,
which are now worthless.

2004
01:38:14,550 --> 01:38:15,720
The third is an exchange agreement

2005
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:18,550
allowing you to exchange
the old shares for new shares,

2006
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:20,890
and then finally a voter holding agreement.

2007
01:38:20,970 --> 01:38:22,720
How many shares of stock will I own?

2008
01:38:22,810 --> 01:38:25,980
1,328,334.

2009
01:38:26,060 --> 01:38:27,440
Jesus Christ.

2010
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:30,440
That represents a 34.4% ownership share.

2011
01:38:30,940 --> 01:38:33,280
Why the increase from the original 30%?

2012
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:36,110
'Cause you may need to dilute it
to award shares to new investors.

2013
01:38:36,820 --> 01:38:39,070
- I love working with business majors.
- I'm telling you.

2014
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:40,200
- Economics.
- Right.

2015
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:45,200
You should know that Mark has already
taken his percentage from 60 down to 51.

2016
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:49,750
Well, Mark doesn't care about money
and he needs to be protected.

2017
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:54,130
Dustin Moskovitz owns 6.81%.

2018
01:38:54,210 --> 01:38:57,050
Sean Parker, 6.47%.

2019
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:00,350
I can live with that.

2020
01:39:00,430 --> 01:39:02,260
And Peter Thiel, 7%.

2021
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:08,940
Would you like to use my pen?

2022
01:39:09,190 --> 01:39:12,150
Eduardo? Eduardo?

2023
01:39:13,900 --> 01:39:15,030
Can you please repeat the question?

2024
01:39:15,110 --> 01:39:17,320
No, it was an outrageously leading question
the first time around,

2025
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:18,530
and now you want us to hear it twice?

2026
01:39:18,610 --> 01:39:20,490
Yes. Would you read it back, please?

2027
01:39:20,570 --> 01:39:21,620
Well, go ahead.

2028
01:39:21,700 --> 01:39:23,410
"Counsel: 'And when you signed
these documents,

2029
01:39:23,490 --> 01:39:26,250
"'were you aware that you were signing
your own death certificate?"'

2030
01:39:26,330 --> 01:39:27,410
No.

2031
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:35,960
It was insanely stupid of me not to have
my own lawyers look over all the...

2032
01:39:36,050 --> 01:39:39,220
In all honesty,
I thought they were my lawyers.

2033
01:39:42,470 --> 01:39:44,060
I was your only friend.

2034
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:47,310
You had one friend.

2035
01:39:52,150 --> 01:39:53,190
My father won't even look at me.

2036
01:39:53,270 --> 01:39:58,360
Okay, Eduardo, did Mr. Zuckerberg say
anything to you after you signed the papers?

2037
01:39:58,490 --> 01:40:01,490
There was a lot of handshaking,
a lot of congratulations.

2038
01:40:02,660 --> 01:40:04,030
He'd already told me that he wouldn't be

2039
01:40:04,120 --> 01:40:07,250
coming back to school
for at least a semester,

2040
01:40:07,330 --> 01:40:10,080
so we were saying goodbye for a while.

2041
01:40:10,870 --> 01:40:12,130
And then before I left he said...

2042
01:40:12,210 --> 01:40:13,290
But you gotta come back.

2043
01:40:13,380 --> 01:40:15,880
Somewhere around the end of November
or early December.

2044
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:18,420
Peter wants to throw us an amazing party
when we hit a million members.

2045
01:40:18,510 --> 01:40:20,260
It's gonna be out of control.
You gotta come back for it.

2046
01:40:20,340 --> 01:40:21,630
A million members?

2047
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:22,890
Yeah.

2048
01:40:23,390 --> 01:40:26,680
Remember the algorithm
on the window at Kirkland?

2049
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:28,810
Yeah.

2050
01:40:32,230 --> 01:40:33,480
Yeah, I'll be here.

2051
01:40:38,650 --> 01:40:39,820
You sure about this?

2052
01:40:39,900 --> 01:40:41,070
You're 20 minutes late.

2053
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:42,610
You're gonna walk in there
and say you overslept

2054
01:40:42,700 --> 01:40:43,820
and didn't have time to get dressed.

2055
01:40:43,910 --> 01:40:46,080
They're gonna pitch you.
Case Equity is going to pitch you.

2056
01:40:46,160 --> 01:40:47,740
They're gonna beg you to take their money.

2057
01:40:47,830 --> 01:40:49,500
You're gonna nod, you're gonna nod,
you're gonna nod,

2058
01:40:49,580 --> 01:40:52,620
and then you're gonna say,
"Which one of you is Roth?"

2059
01:40:52,710 --> 01:40:54,130
No, not Roth. Manningham.

2060
01:40:54,210 --> 01:40:56,340
"Which one of you is Mitchell Manningham?"
And he'll say, "I am."

2061
01:40:56,420 --> 01:40:59,880
And then you say,
"Sean Parker says, 'Fuck you."'

2062
01:41:00,420 --> 01:41:01,760
Walk out.

2063
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:03,050
Okay.

2064
01:41:15,900 --> 01:41:18,020
In late November, I got the e-mail from Mark

2065
01:41:18,110 --> 01:41:20,150
telling me to come out
for the millionth-member party.

2066
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:21,280
What else did the e-mail say?

2067
01:41:21,860 --> 01:41:24,030
It said that we had to have
a business meeting.

2068
01:41:24,910 --> 01:41:28,160
That Mark and Sean had played
some kind of revenge stunt on Case Equity,

2069
01:41:28,830 --> 01:41:30,450
and that Manningham was so impressed

2070
01:41:30,540 --> 01:41:34,460
that he was now making an investment offer
that was hard to turn down.

2071
01:41:34,540 --> 01:41:38,710
So I went to California,
and I went straight to the new offices.

2072
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:42,510
I didn't know whether to dress for the party
or for the business meeting,

2073
01:41:42,590 --> 01:41:44,970
so I kind of dressed for both.

2074
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:47,640
- But it didn't matter.
- Why not?

2075
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:49,930
Because I wasn't called out there
for either one.

2076
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:51,600
What were you called out there for?

2077
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:56,810
An ambush.

2078
01:41:57,230 --> 01:41:59,070
Mr. Saverin. Hey. Right over here.

2079
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:07,240
Hey, man.

2080
01:42:07,320 --> 01:42:08,370
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

2081
01:42:08,450 --> 01:42:11,160
- Good, good, good, good, good.
- Good to see you.

2082
01:42:11,250 --> 01:42:14,710
At first I thought he was joking.
Giving me more contracts to sign.

2083
01:42:19,090 --> 01:42:20,880
But then I started reading.

2084
01:42:24,260 --> 01:42:26,050
Wait, what is this?

2085
01:42:26,390 --> 01:42:29,640
Well, as you know, we had some
new investors that have come in.

2086
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:30,810
What is this?

2087
01:42:43,110 --> 01:42:44,570
Mr. Saverin.

2088
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:48,360
Mark!

2089
01:42:49,660 --> 01:42:51,120
- Mark?
- He's wired in.

2090
01:42:51,200 --> 01:42:52,240
- Sorry?
- He's wired in.

2091
01:42:52,330 --> 01:42:53,790
- Is he?
- Yes.

2092
01:42:55,370 --> 01:42:58,120
- How about now? Are you still wired in?
- Call security.

2093
01:42:58,210 --> 01:43:00,040
You issued 24 million new shares of stock!

2094
01:43:01,250 --> 01:43:02,880
You were told that if new investors
came along...

2095
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:06,090
How much were your shares diluted?
How much were his?

2096
01:43:06,180 --> 01:43:09,930
What was Mr. Zuckerberg's
ownership share diluted down to?

2097
01:43:10,260 --> 01:43:11,300
It wasn't.

2098
01:43:11,390 --> 01:43:15,020
What was Mr. Moskovitz's ownership share
diluted down to?

2099
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:16,430
It wasn't.

2100
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:19,440
What was Sean Parker's ownership share
diluted down to?

2101
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:20,560
It wasn't.

2102
01:43:20,650 --> 01:43:23,320
What was Peter Thiel's ownership share
diluted down to?

2103
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:24,480
It wasn't.

2104
01:43:24,570 --> 01:43:27,570
And what was your ownership share
diluted down to?

2105
01:43:28,570 --> 01:43:31,240
.03%

2106
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:41,380
- You signed the papers.
- You set me up.

2107
01:43:41,460 --> 01:43:44,000
You're gonna blame me because you were
the business head of the company,

2108
01:43:44,090 --> 01:43:45,960
and you made a bad business deal
with your own company?

2109
01:43:46,050 --> 01:43:47,670
It's gonna be like I'm not a part of Facebook.

2110
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:49,090
It won't be like
you're not a part of Facebook.

2111
01:43:49,180 --> 01:43:50,220
You're not a part of Facebook.

2112
01:43:50,300 --> 01:43:52,680
- My name's on the masthead.
- You might wanna check again.

2113
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:54,100
This because I froze the account?

2114
01:43:54,180 --> 01:43:56,350
You think we'd let you
parade around in your ridiculous suits,

2115
01:43:56,430 --> 01:43:57,480
pretending you were running this company?

2116
01:43:57,560 --> 01:43:59,890
Sorry, my Prada's at the cleaner's!

2117
01:43:59,980 --> 01:44:04,360
Along with my hoodie and my fuck-you
flip-flops, you pretentious douchebag!

2118
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:06,110
Security's here. You'll be leaving now.

2119
01:44:06,190 --> 01:44:09,110
- I'm not signing those papers.
- We will get the signature.

2120
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:11,320
Tell me this isn't about me
getting into the Phoenix.

2121
01:44:13,990 --> 01:44:18,200
You... You did it. I knew you did it.
You planted that story about the chicken!

2122
01:44:18,290 --> 01:44:20,410
- I didn't plant that story.
- What's he talking about?

2123
01:44:20,500 --> 01:44:23,460
- You had me accused of animal cruelty.
- Seriously. What the hell's the chicken?

2124
01:44:23,540 --> 01:44:25,250
And I'll bet what you hated the most

2125
01:44:25,340 --> 01:44:28,760
is that they identified me
as a co-founder of Facebook.

2126
01:44:29,220 --> 01:44:32,050
Which I am. You better lawyer up, asshole.

2127
01:44:32,140 --> 01:44:36,680
'Cause I'm not coming back for 30%.
I'm coming back for everything.

2128
01:44:43,150 --> 01:44:46,110
- Get him out of here.
- It's okay, I'm going.

2129
01:44:48,070 --> 01:44:49,360
Hang on.

2130
01:44:51,570 --> 01:44:53,160
Almost forgot.

2131
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:56,490
Here's your $19,000.
I wouldn't cash it, though.

2132
01:44:56,580 --> 01:44:58,120
I drew it on the account you froze.

2133
01:45:03,420 --> 01:45:05,960
I like standing next to you, Sean.

2134
01:45:07,210 --> 01:45:09,340
It makes me look so tough.

2135
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:23,770
Well...

2136
01:45:24,230 --> 01:45:27,150
That's it, that's our show for tonight, people.

2137
01:45:27,230 --> 01:45:29,530
And look, I wanna see everyone here
geared up for a party.

2138
01:45:29,610 --> 01:45:31,690
We're gonna walk into that club
like it's the Macy's Parade.

2139
01:45:31,780 --> 01:45:34,910
Mackey, put it up on the big screen.
We've gotta almost be there.

2140
01:45:38,160 --> 01:45:40,040
- You all right?
- Yeah.

2141
01:45:41,290 --> 01:45:42,750
You were kind of rough on him.

2142
01:45:42,830 --> 01:45:44,830
That's life in the NFL.

2143
01:45:45,040 --> 01:45:46,670
You know you didn't have to be
that rough on him.

2144
01:45:46,750 --> 01:45:48,920
- Listen, I put him...
- Sean!

2145
01:45:50,210 --> 01:45:52,300
You didn't have to be that rough on him.

2146
01:45:52,380 --> 01:45:53,590
He almost killed it.

2147
01:45:56,350 --> 01:45:57,550
I'll send flowers.

2148
01:45:59,260 --> 01:46:03,980
Speaking of flowers, I'm putting together
a party after the party at Kappa Eta Sigma.

2149
01:46:04,060 --> 01:46:05,310
Ashleigh's a sister.

2150
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:06,940
- Ashleigh?
- The intern.

2151
01:46:07,020 --> 01:46:10,190
Yeah. I know who she is. Are you guys...

2152
01:46:10,820 --> 01:46:12,490
Ashleigh? Me? No.

2153
01:46:12,570 --> 01:46:14,030
Well, a little bit.

2154
01:46:14,910 --> 01:46:15,950
Why?

2155
01:46:16,030 --> 01:46:17,870
- No. Nothing, I just...
- Excuse me. Mark?

2156
01:46:17,950 --> 01:46:21,200
- We were just talking about you.
- Just that you're doing a really good job.

2157
01:46:21,870 --> 01:46:24,040
Thanks. I appreciate that.

2158
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:26,120
These came in for you.

2159
01:46:26,210 --> 01:46:28,000
Put them on my desk.

2160
01:46:34,970 --> 01:46:36,380
What's the package?

2161
01:46:37,260 --> 01:46:38,300
Nothing.

2162
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:42,220
- Mackey.
- Yes, sir.

2163
01:46:42,310 --> 01:46:43,600
Refresh.

2164
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:45,310
Sweet!

2165
01:46:51,320 --> 01:46:53,360
And you're not a hugger.

2166
01:46:53,650 --> 01:46:54,940
I know.

2167
01:46:57,570 --> 01:46:59,030
One million!

2168
01:47:00,620 --> 01:47:03,370
Who's got champagne? Huh?

2169
01:47:04,700 --> 01:47:06,500
I've got champagne.

2170
01:47:26,350 --> 01:47:29,940
The next transformative development,
a picture-sharing application.

2171
01:47:30,020 --> 01:47:33,110
A place where you view pictures
that coincide with your social life.

2172
01:47:33,190 --> 01:47:36,190
It is the true digitalization of real life.

2173
01:47:36,280 --> 01:47:38,740
- You can use a CD.
- You can do it off of me.

2174
01:47:38,820 --> 01:47:40,530
You don't just go to a party anymore.

2175
01:47:40,620 --> 01:47:44,370
You go to a party with a digital camera,
and then your friends relive the party online.

2176
01:47:44,450 --> 01:47:45,830
And tagging. The idea...

2177
01:47:45,910 --> 01:47:49,120
- Would this be easier without the bra?
- It's worth finding out.

2178
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:59,260
All right, shut the music down!

2179
01:47:59,630 --> 01:48:01,260
The party's over!

2180
01:48:01,340 --> 01:48:03,140
Everybody, go home!

2181
01:48:03,640 --> 01:48:06,100
I've spent hours watching
what people do when they log on.

2182
01:48:06,180 --> 01:48:07,560
How they check their friends' status updates.

2183
01:48:07,640 --> 01:48:09,140
Wait. That's weird. Why did the music stop?

2184
01:48:09,230 --> 01:48:10,390
Check to see which one of their friends

2185
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:12,400
changed their profiles,
changed their photos...

2186
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:14,060
Seriously, what happened to the music?

2187
01:48:14,150 --> 01:48:16,110
We lived on farms
and then we lived in cities,

2188
01:48:16,190 --> 01:48:18,150
and now we're going to live on the Internet!

2189
01:48:18,240 --> 01:48:21,910
Sean, stop.
I think something's going on downstairs.

2190
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:33,750
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have your attention, please?

2191
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:37,090
It's time for you to go home.
The party is over.

2192
01:48:37,420 --> 01:48:39,260
Then it's all good.

2193
01:48:41,010 --> 01:48:42,090
- It's the cops.
- What?

2194
01:48:42,180 --> 01:48:43,220
Shit! Shit.

2195
01:48:43,300 --> 01:48:47,060
- Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
- Okay, it's okay. Be cool.

2196
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:49,770
Good to see you, Officer.
What can I do for you?

2197
01:48:50,980 --> 01:48:52,020
What's going on?

2198
01:48:52,100 --> 01:48:54,690
Was the music too loud?
We were having a celebration.

2199
01:48:54,770 --> 01:48:56,320
Miss, I need you to button your blouse.

2200
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:59,190
I can tell them to turn the music down.

2201
01:49:03,110 --> 01:49:04,160
That's not mine.

2202
01:49:04,570 --> 01:49:07,580
Okay, we're gonna need identification.
Keep your hands where we can see them.

2203
01:49:07,660 --> 01:49:09,080
Oh, my God.

2204
01:49:09,160 --> 01:49:10,870
You got anything else in your pockets
I should know about?

2205
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:12,000
No, sir. No.

2206
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:14,330
- Don't be stupid, now.
- I don't, I don't.

2207
01:49:19,420 --> 01:49:20,920
What's this?

2208
01:49:21,130 --> 01:49:22,840
That's an EpiPen.

2209
01:49:23,930 --> 01:49:26,260
- And this?
- That's my inhaler.

2210
01:49:27,100 --> 01:49:28,760
How old are you?

2211
01:49:29,350 --> 01:49:32,270
Twenty-one.

2212
01:49:32,350 --> 01:49:33,770
- Twenty-one.
- I'm 21.

2213
01:49:33,850 --> 01:49:35,520
Lying only makes it worse.

2214
01:49:36,900 --> 01:49:39,400
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have lied.

2215
01:49:50,410 --> 01:49:51,450
Hello.

2216
01:49:51,540 --> 01:49:54,040
Listen, something's happened.

2217
01:50:01,340 --> 01:50:02,380
Shit.

2218
01:50:02,470 --> 01:50:04,380
No, it's all right. It's gonna be all right.

2219
01:50:04,470 --> 01:50:08,470
I posted bond, and I wasn't doing anything.
I mean, I've got allergies.

2220
01:50:13,270 --> 01:50:14,310
Interns.

2221
01:50:14,390 --> 01:50:16,230
It was just a party.

2222
01:50:19,020 --> 01:50:22,400
This is gonna be news, Sean.
It's gonna be online any second.

2223
01:50:23,610 --> 01:50:24,650
I know.

2224
01:50:24,740 --> 01:50:26,410
You know with an intern...

2225
01:50:26,490 --> 01:50:28,660
No, it's cool. I have it under control.

2226
01:50:28,740 --> 01:50:30,330
I will get it under control.

2227
01:50:30,450 --> 01:50:32,790
I will call someone
and see what the next move is.

2228
01:50:32,870 --> 01:50:34,410
But this is gonna be news now.

2229
01:50:35,170 --> 01:50:37,670
You don't think Wardo
was involved, do you?

2230
01:50:37,750 --> 01:50:38,790
I mean, do you think...

2231
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:39,960
No.

2232
01:50:40,170 --> 01:50:42,050
Or Manningham. One of them.

2233
01:50:42,130 --> 01:50:45,380
Somebody. Somebody sent the coke
in there, because it got in there.

2234
01:50:45,470 --> 01:50:47,300
You believe me. God, this is gonna be fine.

2235
01:50:52,140 --> 01:50:53,350
Right?

2236
01:50:56,100 --> 01:50:57,690
Go home, Sean.

2237
01:51:12,910 --> 01:51:14,120
Mark?

2238
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:17,080
Mark.

2239
01:51:19,580 --> 01:51:21,250
We're done for the day.

2240
01:51:21,340 --> 01:51:23,920
Yeah. Yeah, I was just sitting here.

2241
01:51:27,590 --> 01:51:29,510
What happened to Sean?

2242
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:32,260
He still owns 7% of the company.

2243
01:51:36,430 --> 01:51:40,690
All you had all day was that salad.
Do you wanna get something to eat?

2244
01:51:40,770 --> 01:51:42,110
I can't.

2245
01:51:49,780 --> 01:51:51,030
I'm not a bad guy.

2246
01:51:51,120 --> 01:51:52,620
I know that.

2247
01:51:52,990 --> 01:51:56,500
When there's emotional testimony,
I assume 85% of it is exaggeration.

2248
01:51:56,620 --> 01:51:58,080
And the other 15?

2249
01:51:58,160 --> 01:52:01,290
Perjury. Creation myths need a devil.

2250
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:06,300
What happens now?

2251
01:52:07,470 --> 01:52:11,680
Sy and the others are having a steak
on University Avenue.

2252
01:52:12,180 --> 01:52:13,640
Then they'll come back up to the office,

2253
01:52:13,720 --> 01:52:17,020
and start working on a settlement
agreement to present to you.

2254
01:52:17,140 --> 01:52:19,020
- They're gonna settle?
- Oh, yeah.

2255
01:52:19,640 --> 01:52:22,480
- And you're gonna have to pay a little extra.
- Why?

2256
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:24,730
So that these guys sign
a nondisclosure agreement.

2257
01:52:24,820 --> 01:52:27,820
They say one unflattering word about you
in public, you own their wife and kids.

2258
01:52:27,900 --> 01:52:29,110
I invented Facebook.

2259
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:31,320
I'm talking about a jury.

2260
01:52:31,570 --> 01:52:34,160
I specialize in voir dire, jury selection.

2261
01:52:34,240 --> 01:52:36,620
What a jury sees
when they look at a defendant.

2262
01:52:36,700 --> 01:52:39,080
Clothes, hair, speaking style, likeability...

2263
01:52:39,160 --> 01:52:40,370
Likeability.

2264
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:43,330
I've been licensed to practice law
for all of 20 months,

2265
01:52:43,420 --> 01:52:44,790
and I could get a jury to believe

2266
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:47,590
that you planted the story
about Eduardo and the chicken.

2267
01:52:47,670 --> 01:52:48,760
Watch what else.

2268
01:52:49,260 --> 01:52:51,340
Why weren't you at Sean's sorority party
that night?

2269
01:52:52,090 --> 01:52:54,300
- You think I'm the one that called the police?
- Doesn't matter.

2270
01:52:54,390 --> 01:52:56,470
I asked the question,
now everybody's thinking about it.

2271
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:58,680
You've lost your jury in the first 10 minutes.

2272
01:53:00,350 --> 01:53:01,480
Farm animals.

2273
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:02,730
Yeah.

2274
01:53:03,730 --> 01:53:06,270
I was drunk and angry and stupid.

2275
01:53:06,360 --> 01:53:08,610
- And blogging...
- And blogging.

2276
01:53:09,740 --> 01:53:11,070
Pay them.

2277
01:53:11,360 --> 01:53:12,570
In the scheme of things,

2278
01:53:13,030 --> 01:53:14,360
it's a speeding ticket.

2279
01:53:16,370 --> 01:53:18,740
That's what Sy will tell you tomorrow.

2280
01:53:18,870 --> 01:53:21,750
Do you think anybody would mind if I stayed
and used the computer for a minute?

2281
01:53:21,870 --> 01:53:23,370
I can't imagine it would be a problem.

2282
01:53:23,460 --> 01:53:24,710
Thanks.

2283
01:53:25,540 --> 01:53:27,880
I appreciate your help today.
