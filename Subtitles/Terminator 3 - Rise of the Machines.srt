1
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:57,370
The future has not been written.

2
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:01,350
There is no fate but what
we make for ourselves.

3
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,000
I wish I could believe that.

4
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,700
My name is John Connor.

5
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,440
They tried to murder me before I was born.

6
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,910
When I was 13, they tried again.

7
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,180
Machines from the future.

8
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,980
Terminators.

9
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:43,680
All my life, my mother told me
the storm was coming.

10
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,120
- Judgment Day.
- Connor!

11
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,190
The beginning of a war
between man and machines.

12
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,870
Three billion lives
would vanish in an instant.

13
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:02,170
And I would lead what was left
of the human race to ultimate victory.

14
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,380
It hasn't happened.

15
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,940
No bombs fell.

16
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,650
Computers didn't take control.

17
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,010
We stopped Judgment Day.

18
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:22,290
I should feel safe...

19
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,400
...but I don't.

20
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,530
So I live off the grid.

21
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:34,230
No phone, no address.

22
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:39,070
No one and nothing can find me.

23
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:43,550
I've erased all connections to the past.

24
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,080
But as hard as I try...

25
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,450
...I can't erase my dreams...

26
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,490
...my nightmares.

27
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,230
I feel the weight of the future
bearing down on me.

28
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,900
A future I don't want.

29
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,670
So I keep running...

30
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,810
...as fast as I can.

31
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,440
Anywhere.

32
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,950
Nowhere.

33
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,720
Oh, my God.

34
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,760
Are you okay?

35
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,020
Do you want me to call 911?

36
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,200
I like this car.

37
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,430
What are you-?

38
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,800
You, in the silver Lexus. Slow down.

39
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:33,310
Slow down and pull over immediately.

40
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:09,210
Lady, have you any idea
how fast you were going?

41
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,350
Let me see your license and registration.

42
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,650
I like your gun.

43
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,020
What?

44
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:24,560
This stupid thing's not working.

45
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,960
What's wrong with this thing?

46
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:31,290
I hate machines.

47
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:36,230
- Hello?
- Kate, it's your father.

48
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,740
You're blowing me off again.

49
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:43,100
I'm so sorry. You know how much
I wanted to see you this weekend.

50
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:48,240
- But we're having computer problems-
- I know, you can't talk about it.

51
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,920
It's just...

52
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,020
...Scott was really looking forward to this.

53
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:58,190
Katie. I wish I had more time
to get to know him. I really do.

54
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,230
That's okay. You're bound
to run into him at the wedding.

55
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,630
Please. I'm still
in a state of denial about that.

56
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,230
- You're not the only one.
- Hey, kiddo.

57
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,870
You don't need me
to pass judgment on this guy.

58
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,370
You've done the right thing
your whole life.

59
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,910
You won't make a mistake. You never do.

60
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,380
I'm the luckiest father
in the world, you know?

61
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,950
I've never had to be afraid
for my daughter.

62
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,950
Listen, I hate this. I gotta run.
Come see me. I promise I won't cancel.

63
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,280
We will.

64
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,390
- Bye, Dad, I love you.
- Love you too.

65
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:48,970
- Okay, what have we got?
- This new computer virus is tricky.

66
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,840
It's infected half the civilian Internet
as well as secondary military apps.

67
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,810
- Payroll, inventory.
- Primary defense nets are still clean?

68
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,250
So far the firewalls are holding up.

69
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:02,180
Sir, the Pentagon has proposed we use
our Al to scan the infrastructure.

70
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,830
Search and destroy
for any hint of the virus.

71
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:08,330
I know, Tony, but that's like
going after a fly with a bazooka.

72
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,130
Once the connection's made,
it should only be a few minutes.

73
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,670
During which we've put everything under
the control of a single computer system.

74
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,640
The most intelligent system
ever conceived.

75
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,780
I still prefer to keep humans in the loop.

76
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,110
I'm not sure Skynet's ready.

77
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,170
Yes, sir.

78
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,710
Thanks.

79
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,550
You're supposed to go around
to the back.

80
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:22,680
Hey, I said you're supposed to go-

81
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,330
- Take off your clothes.
- Patience, honey.

82
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,270
Bitch. Wait your turn.

83
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,500
- Your clothes.
- Talk to the hand.

84
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,010
Now.

85
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:40,620
Welcome to Jim's Burgers.
Can I take your order?

86
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,630
- Jose Barrera?
- Yeah, that's me.

87
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:06,820
Growing concern over widespread outages
in the global digital network...

88
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:10,420
...have prompted rumors
of a new computer super-virus.

89
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:14,150
- Wall Street analysts are confident...
- Shit! My mom's home.

90
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,390
Here. Hide the beer. Hide the beer.
Here. Take that.

91
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,470
Go, go, go.

92
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:29,100
Elizabeth and William Anderson?

93
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:34,220
I'm Bill. My sister's upstairs.
Is there something wrong?

94
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,860
What's going on?

95
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:52,230
I have to go to the clinic.
It's an emergency.

96
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:54,560
It's 4:30 in the morning.

97
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:58,470
Well, I'll be back before you get up.

98
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,440
Cool it, guys, it's just me.

99
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:48,020
We've got a sick cat coming in.

100
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,070
Great.

101
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,640
Junkies.

102
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,920
Please, don't do that.

103
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:27,160
I suppose it was you who
ripped us off last week.

104
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:30,160
Put the phone down.

105
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,260
Sorry.

106
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,130
I just...

107
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,400
I needed some medicine.

108
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:41,170
There's an emergency clinic
half a mile away.

109
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,940
Can't do that.

110
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:50,420
How much did you take?

111
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,350
- Enough.
- Well...

112
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,190
...this is the stuff we use
to chemically neuter dogs.

113
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,490
Take a look.

114
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,800
Hey!

115
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,500
Jesus! You didn't have to do that!

116
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,830
Next time bring a clue,
not a paintball gun.

117
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:18,500
- No, this isn't what you think.
- Yeah, right.

118
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:41,540
It's Hercules. I think he's got pneumonia.
He started coughing and wouldn't stop.

119
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,160
- Betsy, I've got a problem in the back.
- A problem? This is an emergency!

120
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,930
- It sounds like a hairball.
- I know what a hairball sounds like.

121
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:53,240
- Where's Dr. Monroe?
- It's 5:30 in the morning.

122
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,710
I'm sure he's home sleeping.
He'll come in if he has to.

123
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,180
Just wait in here with Hercules
and I'll be a few minutes, all right?

124
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:22,170
Mike Kripke's basement.

125
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,710
What? What does that mean?

126
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,790
You're John Connor.

127
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,560
I'm Kate Brewster.

128
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,070
We went to
West Hills Junior High together.

129
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,740
- Jesus.
- What happened to you, John?

130
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,020
Middle of eighth grade,
you just disappeared.

131
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:08,520
And there was that thing
about your foster parents.

132
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,420
Yeah, they were murdered.

133
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,890
I didn't do it.

134
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:19,390
What the hell?

135
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:22,160
Is somebody with you?

136
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,060
Katherine Brewster?

137
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,310
No.

138
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:57,180
John Connor was here.
Where did he go?

139
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,660
Tell me. Where did he go?

140
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,870
Katherine Brewster?

141
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,140
What are you doing? Let me down!

142
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,710
Let me down! Let me down!

143
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:57,450
Where is John Connor?

144
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:00,490
If I tell you, will you let me go?

145
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,820
Yes.

146
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:05,320
He's...

147
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:08,660
...in the kennel, in a cage.

148
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,530
You said that you'd let me go.

149
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,260
I lied.

150
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:21,880
Please, please, please.
You have to let me go!

151
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:12,720
John Connor.

152
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:17,030
It is time.

153
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,660
You here to kill me?

154
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:29,570
No. You must live.

155
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:44,190
- Why are you here? Where are we going?
- Keep moving.

156
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,260
Get out of here.

157
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:52,090
Now!

158
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,410
- No pulse.
- See if you can get him down.

159
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,950
I can't.

160
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,150
This guy weighs a ton.

161
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,910
- 911.
- Yes. Yes. I'm being kidnapped.

162
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:20,610
- Where are you now?
- I don't know where. I'm in my truck.

163
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,290
It's a Toyota Tundra.

164
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:28,890
It says "Emery Animal Hospital"
on the side. I'm locked inside the back.

165
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,300
Hello?

166
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,530
Hello?

167
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:39,240
Shit! Shit!

168
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,780
Get off.

169
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:11,950
Let me out!

170
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,830
What are you doing here?

171
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,530
You tell me. You got me into this.

172
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:19,200
- Stop the car.
- I can't. Not yet.

173
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:23,400
- You bastard! Stop the car!
- Shut up!

174
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,420
Son of a bitch.

175
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,020
Goddamn it.

176
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,190
Look what you did to my car.

177
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,660
This is my company car, asshole.

178
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,360
Get your ass out here.

179
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,730
Get your ass out of the car. Now!

180
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,800
What are you doing?

181
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:55,070
If you don't have insurance,
I'm gonna rip your balls off.

182
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,510
- I don't want any problems, okay?
- Shut up!

183
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,770
Help!

184
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,210
Who's talking back there?
What's going on?

185
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,570
- Calm down.
- Shut up!

186
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:06,520
- I'm being kidnapped! Call the police!
- Well, I'll be goddamned.

187
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:08,550
- Call 911!
- A cop when you need one.

188
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,550
Help, please! Please!

189
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,550
Let me out of here! Help!

190
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:19,030
Get back here, asshole!

191
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,920
That's the cops!
You have to pull over!

192
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:45,720
Yeah, first chance I get.

193
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,790
Hold on!

194
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:04,930
Stop it!

195
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,000
I'll drive.

196
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,430
Get out.

197
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,060
Excuse me.

198
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:04,640
Move over.

199
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:37,040
No sign of brain trauma.

200
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:41,110
Yeah, I'm fine, thanks.

201
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,850
Do you even remember me?

202
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:52,520
Sarah Connor? Blowing up Cyberdyne?

203
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:56,090
"Hasta la vista, baby. "
Ring any bells?

204
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,750
That was a different T-101.

205
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:01,630
What, do you come off an assembly line
or something?

206
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,000
Exactly.

207
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:07,140
Oh, man. I'm gonna have
to teach you everything all over again.

208
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:12,170
Katherine Brewster,
have you sustained injury?

209
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:15,010
Drop dead, you asshole!

210
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:18,740
I'm unable to comply.

211
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,760
Where are you taking me?

212
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:32,090
To a safe location.

213
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,280
All right, get off at the next exit.
Let her out.

214
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:54,680
Negative.
Katherine Brewster must be protected.

215
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:58,490
- I thought I was the one they were after.
- You could not be located.

216
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:03,150
So a T-X was sent back through time
to eliminate your lieutenants.

217
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:08,130
So she's gonna be in the Resistance?

218
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,500
No, no.
No, you shouldn't even exist.

219
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,200
I mean,
we took out Cyberdyne over 10 years ago.

220
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:21,210
- We stopped Judgment Day.
- You only postponed it.

221
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,580
Judgment Day is inevitable.

222
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:33,080
I require a cutting tool.

223
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:42,300
Here, take the wheel.

224
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:49,130
- What are you doing?
- I am powered by two hydrogen fuel cells.

225
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:52,610
My primary cell was damaged
by a plasma attack.

226
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,910
T- X is designed for extreme combat,
driven by a plasma reactor...

227
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,050
...and equipped with onboard weapons.

228
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,550
Its arsenal includes...

229
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,280
...nanotechnological transjectors.

230
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:07,330
- Meaning?
- It can control other machines.

231
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:14,460
Its body chassis is heavily armored
and hardened to withstand external attack.

232
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,800
- You'll find a way to destroy her.
- Unlikely.

233
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:21,210
I'm an obsolete design.

234
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:25,710
T- X is faster, more powerful
and more intelligent.

235
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,820
It's a far more effective
killing machine.

236
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,810
Oh, great.

237
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:32,250
That's great.

238
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:36,450
My presence in this timeline
has been anticipated.

239
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:41,050
T- X is designed to terminate
other cybernetic organisms.

240
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:46,330
So she's an anti-Terminator
Terminator?

241
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,400
You've gotta be shitting me.

242
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:53,010
No, I am not shitting you.

243
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:12,490
When ruptured,
the fuel cells become unstable.

244
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,290
Relax.

245
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:17,950
- Let me out of here!
- Relax!

246
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:40,390
Man, this is wack.

247
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:43,750
It's been like this for hours.
Every goddamn station.

248
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:07,070
Hey.

249
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:10,110
Hey! Are you gonna pay for that?

250
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,220
Talk to the hand.

251
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,440
Help! Help me!

252
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:37,600
Help!

253
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,410
I think we better go.

254
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,070
Jerky?

255
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:20,220
You're kidnapping me.

256
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,520
- Look-
- God, you were always a delinquent.

257
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:27,630
And look at you now, sitting there
like the bad boy thing still works.

258
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,660
What are you,
some kind of gang member?

259
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:33,230
How do you live with yourself?

260
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:37,030
What?

261
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:43,100
Tell her who I am.

262
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:48,980
John Connor is leader of the Worldwide
Resistance and last hope of humankind.

263
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,950
Right. And him?

264
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:56,350
He's a robot from the future.

265
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:00,190
Living tissue over a metal skeleton,
sent back in time to protect me.

266
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,160
Go to hell.

267
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,490
He doesn't mean you any harm.

268
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,790
I have a fiance.

269
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:11,130
He's gonna be looking for me.

270
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:13,710
What is it that you want?

271
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:17,000
Just...

272
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:19,580
...imagine...

273
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:25,210
...if you knew you were gonna do
something important with your life.

274
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:27,680
Something amazing.

275
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:31,720
Maybe the most important thing
anyone has ever done.

276
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,990
But there's a catch.

277
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:37,620
Something terrible has to happen.

278
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,440
You couldn't...

279
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:48,770
...live with yourself if you didn't try
to stop it, but...

280
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:50,600
What are you talking about?

281
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:56,450
It's just- The life you know...

282
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:59,720
...all the stuff that
you take for granted...

283
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:02,050
...it's not gonna last.

284
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,260
Mike Kripke.

285
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:14,090
Back there, why did you say
"Kripke's basement"?

286
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:15,860
Because Mike Kripke's house...

287
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:19,370
...that's where the kids used
to go make out, right?

288
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:26,910
So you and me-
Wait, did we...?

289
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,750
Holy shit, we did.

290
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:35,580
We made out in Kripke's basement.
I cannot believe you remembered that.

291
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:40,960
I must have made
some kind of impression.

292
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:42,490
Give me a break.

293
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:46,230
I only remembered because
the next day you were in the news.

294
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:56,440
Wait a second. You and me hooked up
the day before I first met him.

295
00:46:57,510 --> 00:47:00,610
And now again, 10 years later.

296
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:04,980
We were supposed to meet.

297
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:08,250
Coincidence.

298
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:14,950
Yeah.

299
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:43,350
Hon? Did you just get in?

300
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:05,870
Hi, I'm Detective Edwards, L.A.P.D.
This is Detective Bell.

301
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:09,210
We're looking for Katherine Brewster.
Is she here?

302
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:10,580
No.

303
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:15,150
- You're her fiance, Scott Mason?
- Yes.

304
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:19,190
There was an incident at the
veterinary hospital where she works.

305
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,060
We're concerned something
may have happened to her.

306
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:23,390
Where is she?

307
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:27,030
We got a report from a gas station
attendant near Victorville...

308
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:31,100
...about a possible kidnapping
and it might be related.

309
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:33,570
I'll help you find her.

310
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:47,280
Come with me.

311
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:53,350
Go.

312
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,950
Your mother?

313
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:28,430
I never even knew
where she was buried.

314
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:34,230
I hit the road the day she died.

315
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:40,370
Why did you bring me here?

316
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:45,810
No! What are you doing?

317
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:47,500
Hey, stop!

318
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:49,080
Get away from it! Stop!

319
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,320
Sarah Connor was cremated in Mexico.

320
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:01,790
Her friends scattered her ashes
in the sea.

321
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:05,390
They stored these weapons
in accordance with her will.

322
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:08,360
What happened to her?

323
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,870
Leukemia.

324
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:16,680
I'm sorry.

325
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:21,840
We were living in Baja
when she was diagnosed.

326
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,210
They only gave her six months.

327
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:30,280
But she fought for three years.

328
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:34,990
Long enough to make sure.

329
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:39,020
To make sure?

330
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:44,000
That the world didn't end.

331
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,300
"Every day after this one is a gift. "

332
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,350
She told me, "We made it. We're free. "

333
00:50:58,190 --> 00:51:00,810
But I never really believed that.

334
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:06,260
I guess she didn't either.

335
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:11,760
You know you were about
the closest thing to a father I ever had?

336
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:14,730
How pathetic is that?

337
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:17,500
Out of my way!

338
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:22,870
My mission is to protect you.

339
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:25,010
That's enough.

340
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:30,050
Move or I'll do it!
I swear I will! I'll shoot you!

341
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:33,390
Go ahead. See what happens.

342
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:49,800
Don't do that.

343
00:51:51,870 --> 00:51:53,930
Oh, my God.

344
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:03,410
This is the police.
We have the building surrounded.

345
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:05,740
Release your hostage!

346
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:28,400
Just leave me here. I'm not the one
you want. You're wasting your time.

347
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:32,640
Incorrect. John Connor
leads the Resistance to victory.

348
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:34,070
How?

349
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:35,840
Why? Why me?

350
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,250
You are John Connor.

351
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:42,920
Christ, my mom fed me that bullshit
since the cradle.

352
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,990
Look at me.
I'm no leader, I never was!

353
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,250
I'm never gonna-

354
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:53,700
Let go.

355
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:57,000
You're right.
You're not the one I want.

356
00:52:57,270 --> 00:52:59,570
I'm wasting my time.

357
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:05,930
Fuck you, you fucking machine!

358
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:08,270
Better.

359
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,540
Oh, you were just dicking with me?

360
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,450
Anger is more useful than despair.

361
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:17,180
What?

362
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,820
Basic psychology is among
my subroutines.

363
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:27,160
Perps still holed up?

364
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:29,360
Gotcha.

365
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,060
Good news. Your fiancee's okay.

366
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,330
Where is she?

367
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:36,000
Greenlawn Cemetery,
up off the 5 freeway.

368
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:40,150
It's right by the desert.
But they're gonna bring her back to the-

369
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:43,580
Oh, my God! Oh, my dear Jesus! God!

370
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:17,410
You're safe now. They can't hurt you.

371
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:21,150
Kate, my name is Dr. Silberman.

372
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:24,650
I'm a post-trauma counselor
for the sheriff's department.

373
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:26,850
How are you feeling?

374
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:29,620
He's not human.

375
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:34,130
He's really not human.

376
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:40,030
I know what it's like to be
in a hostage situation.

377
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:42,270
I've been there myself.

378
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:45,570
The fear, the adrenaline.

379
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:49,650
You find yourself imagining things.

380
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:52,740
Impossible things.

381
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:55,650
Crazy things.

382
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:59,150
Insane things.

383
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:03,990
Take years to get over it.

384
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:07,670
- Go, go, go!
- Move it!

385
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:14,640
Drop your weapon!

386
00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:20,440
And the coffin!

387
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:25,270
Take him down! Take him down!

388
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:08,250
Resume fire!

389
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,700
We must reacquire Katherine Brewster.

390
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:21,410
Why? What makes her
so goddamn important?

391
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:25,910
Through her, you contact remnants of the
military and learn how to fight Skynet...

392
00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:28,580
...forming the core
of the Resistance.

393
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:31,380
Later,
your children will become important.

394
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:35,310
- What?
- She's your wife.

395
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:35,880
Get in!

396
00:57:36,050 --> 00:57:37,570
Do you want to live? Come on!

397
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:03,310
- It was Scott! How could it be Scott?
- Your fiance?

398
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:07,470
The T-X is polymimetic,
able to take the form of anything it touches.

399
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:10,310
Your fiance is dead.

400
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:35,900
Oh, my God!

401
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:42,710
Do something!

402
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:15,440
Get down.

403
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:40,200
We need a new vehicle.

404
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:04,650
Hey, come on.

405
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:06,950
We gotta keep moving.

406
01:01:09,130 --> 01:01:11,690
She killed Scott because of me.

407
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:20,770
Look, I know this won't help...

408
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:28,540
...but sometimes things happen
that we just can't change.

409
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,040
It's not your fault.

410
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:51,730
Are you sure about this?

411
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:54,010
About her and me, I mean.

412
01:01:54,170 --> 01:01:58,800
Your confusion is not rational.
She's a healthy female of breeding age.

413
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:00,840
There's more to it than that.

414
01:02:01,010 --> 01:02:05,710
My database does not encompass
the dynamics of human pair bonding.

415
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:12,850
So this Terminatrix, how many others
does she have on her hit list?

416
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:17,920
Twenty-two. Anderson, Elizabeth.
Anderson, William.

417
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:20,860
Barrera, Jose. Brewster, Robert.

418
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:22,300
My father?

419
01:02:22,470 --> 01:02:27,500
Having failed to acquire its primary target,
T- X will resume its default program.

420
01:02:27,670 --> 01:02:31,730
- She's gonna kill my father too?
- There's a high probability.

421
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:34,840
- No.
- Who is he? What does he do?

422
01:02:35,010 --> 01:02:39,510
He's in the Air Force. Weapon design,
secret stuff. I don't know, exactly.

423
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:43,450
General Robert Brewster
is program director of CRS...

424
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:47,560
...Cyber Research Systems,
autonomous weapons division.

425
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:50,630
Skynet. You're talking about Skynet.

426
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:55,100
Skynet is one of the digital defense systems
developed under Brewster.

427
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:56,760
Oh, God.

428
01:02:57,170 --> 01:03:00,400
Oh, my God. Of course.

429
01:03:00,770 --> 01:03:02,240
It all makes sense now.

430
01:03:03,110 --> 01:03:06,510
If you hadn't come back when I was a kid,
changed everything...

431
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:10,780
...she and I would have gotten together
then. I would have met her father.

432
01:03:11,150 --> 01:03:13,580
- Don't you see?
- I don't understand.

433
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:17,690
Your father.
This is all about your father.

434
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:22,450
He's the key. He always was. Your father
is the one who can shut Skynet down.

435
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:26,330
He's the only one who ever could.

436
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:30,400
We have to get to him
before the T-X does.

437
01:03:30,570 --> 01:03:35,100
- Negative. I cannot jeopardize my mission.
- This is your mission, to save people!

438
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:39,210
My mission is to ensure the survival
of John Connor and Katherine Brewster.

439
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:42,280
I am giving you an order.

440
01:03:42,450 --> 01:03:45,040
I am not programmed
to follow your orders.

441
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:48,280
- After the nuclear war, you both-
- Nuclear war?!

442
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:51,510
There doesn't have to be a war!
We can stop it!

443
01:03:51,690 --> 01:03:53,890
There is insufficient time.

444
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:58,220
The first launch sequences
will be initiated at 6:18 p. m.

445
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,160
- What, today?
- Affirmative.

446
01:04:00,330 --> 01:04:03,030
John, what is he saying?

447
01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:06,160
Judgment Day.

448
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:09,740
The end of the world.

449
01:04:11,110 --> 01:04:13,080
It's today, three hours from now.

450
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:15,570
Two hours and 53 minutes.

451
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:20,810
We must continue south into Mexico
to escape the primary blast zones.

452
01:04:21,550 --> 01:04:24,350
No, we have to get to her dad.

453
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:29,930
The Mojave area will sustain
significant nuclear fallout.

454
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:31,720
You will not survive.

455
01:04:32,570 --> 01:04:36,900
You mean we go run and hide somewhere
in a hole while the bombs fall?

456
01:04:37,770 --> 01:04:39,200
It is your destiny.

457
01:04:42,910 --> 01:04:44,710
- Fuck my destiny.
- John.

458
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,510
You cannot self-terminate.

459
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:54,490
No, you can't.
I can do whatever I want.

460
01:04:54,650 --> 01:04:57,450
I'm a human being.
I'm not some goddamn robot.

461
01:04:57,620 --> 01:04:59,420
- Cybernetic organism.
- Whatever!

462
01:04:59,590 --> 01:05:02,460
Either we get her father
to shut Skynet down...

463
01:05:02,630 --> 01:05:07,360
...stop this shit from ever happening,
or so much for the great John Connor.

464
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:12,530
Because your future, my destiny,
I don't want any part of it. I never did.

465
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:17,910
Based on your pupil dilation,
skin temperature and motor functions...

466
01:05:18,510 --> 01:05:24,310
...I calculate an 83% probability
that you will not pull the trigger.

467
01:05:28,490 --> 01:05:32,790
Please do what he says.
You have to save my father!

468
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,520
We can reach CRS
in approximately one hour...

469
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:43,460
...depending on traffic conditions.

470
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:09,490
I can't get a line.

471
01:06:12,570 --> 01:06:14,400
The whole cell network is down.

472
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:17,500
Skynet is assuming control
over global communications...

473
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:20,000
...in preparation for its attack.

474
01:06:20,170 --> 01:06:24,340
So if this war is between people
and machines...

475
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:26,870
...why are you on our side?

476
01:06:27,050 --> 01:06:30,980
The Resistance captured me
and reprogrammed my CPU.

477
01:06:31,150 --> 01:06:34,640
I was originally designed
for assassination missions.

478
01:06:37,590 --> 01:06:39,110
So...

479
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:43,330
...you don't really care
if this mission succeeds or not.

480
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:47,860
If we get killed,
does that mean anything to you?

481
01:06:48,030 --> 01:06:51,300
If you were to die,
I will become useless.

482
01:06:51,470 --> 01:06:54,600
There will be no reason for me to exist.

483
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:02,310
Thank you for doing this.

484
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,470
Your gratitude is not required.

485
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:07,580
I am programmed
to follow your commands.

486
01:07:08,590 --> 01:07:09,990
Her commands?

487
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:15,530
Katherine Brewster had me reactivated and
sent through the time displacement field.

488
01:07:15,690 --> 01:07:19,320
What exactly am I in this
future of yours?

489
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:23,200
You're John Connor's spouse
and second-in-command.

490
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:27,040
No, I-

491
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:29,000
What?

492
01:07:31,210 --> 01:07:32,840
You're a mess.

493
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:38,250
Hey, you're not exactly my type, either.

494
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:41,240
Why didn't I send you back?

495
01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:43,720
I am not authorized
to answer your question.

496
01:07:45,490 --> 01:07:48,980
- Why didn't he send you back?
- He was dead.

497
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:55,260
Well, that sucks.

498
01:07:56,200 --> 01:08:00,100
- Humans inevitably die.
- Yeah, I know.

499
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:03,130
So how does it-? No.

500
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:06,370
Maybe I don't want to know.

501
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:09,440
How does he die?

502
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:13,950
John Connor was terminated
on July 4th, 2032.

503
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:18,020
I was selected for the emotional attachment
he had for my model number...

504
01:08:18,190 --> 01:08:22,460
...due to his boyhood experiences.
This aided in my infiltration.

505
01:08:23,430 --> 01:08:25,060
What are you saying?

506
01:08:26,830 --> 01:08:29,160
I killed you.

507
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:46,440
This has to be a mistake. As of 1100 hours,
all primary military systems were secure.

508
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:50,680
They were. Only the civilian sector
was affected. Internet, air traffic.

509
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:53,650
Minutes ago, guidance computers
at Vandenberg crashed.

510
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:56,520
We thought it was an error.
It looks like the virus.

511
01:08:56,700 --> 01:09:00,960
- Early warning in Alaska is down.
- Satellite signals are scrambled.

512
01:09:01,130 --> 01:09:04,000
What about the missile silos, the subs?

513
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,230
We've lost contact.

514
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:11,140
You're saying this country
is completely open to attack.

515
01:09:11,310 --> 01:09:14,140
Theoretically, we could be
under attack already.

516
01:09:14,310 --> 01:09:19,750
Who's doing this? A foreign power
or some computer hacker in his garage?

517
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:22,050
We can't trace the virus
or pin it down.

518
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:26,350
It keeps growing and changing,
like it has a mind of its own.

519
01:09:26,890 --> 01:09:28,660
This can't be happening.

520
01:09:28,830 --> 01:09:33,030
The Pentagon's on the secure line.
It's the chairman.

521
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:38,200
All right.

522
01:09:52,650 --> 01:09:54,550
Look...

523
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:56,850
...none of this is gonna happen.

524
01:09:57,490 --> 01:10:02,890
We get to your dad, get him to pull the plug
on Skynet. The bombs won't fall.

525
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:08,100
He won't have to kill me someday.

526
01:10:08,870 --> 01:10:11,200
He'll never even exist.

527
01:10:12,870 --> 01:10:18,210
You and I, we can
just go our separate ways.

528
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:25,480
You know, Mike Kripke's basement...

529
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:31,190
That was the first time
I ever kissed a guy.

530
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:33,720
Really?

531
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,130
Your levity is good.

532
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:47,260
It relieves tension and the fear of death.

533
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:17,030
We're hoping you have a solution for us.

534
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:20,970
I know, sir, but Skynet is not ready
for a system-wide connection.

535
01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:24,110
That's not what your civilian
counterparts there told me.

536
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,570
They say we can stop this damn virus.

537
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:30,240
I understand there's a certain amount
of performance anxiety...

538
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:33,750
...but your boys say if we plug Skynet
into all of our systems...

539
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:37,980
...it'll squash this thing and give me back
control of my military.

540
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:40,650
Mr. Chairman, I need
to make myself very clear.

541
01:11:40,830 --> 01:11:44,260
If we uplink now, Skynet will be
in control of your military.

542
01:11:44,430 --> 01:11:48,460
But you'll be in control of Skynet, right?

543
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,930
That is correct, sir.

544
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:52,470
Then do it.

545
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:55,400
And Brewster, if this thing works...

546
01:11:55,570 --> 01:11:58,940
...you'll get all the funding
you'll ever need.

547
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:01,810
Yes, sir.

548
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:12,040
Sir?

549
01:13:13,290 --> 01:13:15,050
Shall I?

550
01:13:16,590 --> 01:13:18,150
No.

551
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:21,450
It's my job now.

552
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:38,970
- Skynet Defense System activated.
- We're in.

553
01:13:39,140 --> 01:13:42,380
We're past the firewalls, local
defense nets, Minutemen, subs.

554
01:13:42,550 --> 01:13:46,680
Skynet's fully operational,
processing at 60 teraflops a second.

555
01:13:46,850 --> 01:13:50,720
It should take less than a minute
to find the virus and kill it.

556
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:54,690
Let's pray to God this works.

557
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:02,090
Power failure?

558
01:14:02,270 --> 01:14:04,600
No. I don't know what it is.

559
01:14:15,650 --> 01:14:18,080
What the hell is going on?

560
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:19,270
Daddy!

561
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:21,380
What are you doing here?

562
01:14:27,730 --> 01:14:30,520
Daddy! Get away from it!

563
01:14:34,330 --> 01:14:35,860
Watch out!

564
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:55,020
Daddy, don't move.

565
01:14:59,390 --> 01:15:01,120
She'll be back.

566
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,750
We have to shut down Skynet.

567
01:15:03,930 --> 01:15:06,560
Where's the system core?
In this building?

568
01:15:06,730 --> 01:15:10,530
Skynet. The virus has infected Skynet.

569
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:13,830
Skynet is the virus!
It's why everything's falling apart!

570
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:16,130
Skynet has become self-aware.

571
01:15:16,310 --> 01:15:19,940
In one hour it will initiate
a massive nuclear attack on its enemy.

572
01:15:20,110 --> 01:15:21,200
What enemy?

573
01:15:21,810 --> 01:15:23,210
Us!

574
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:24,710
Humans.

575
01:15:33,830 --> 01:15:37,090
Oh, God! It's the machines.
They're starting to take over.

576
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:40,720
My office, on this floor,
we have to get there.

577
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:44,160
The access codes are in my safe.

578
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:07,040
- Why are they killing everyone?
- To destroy any possible threat to Skynet.

579
01:17:07,220 --> 01:17:08,980
Which ones are the codes?

580
01:17:09,150 --> 01:17:10,990
Red envelope.

581
01:17:14,790 --> 01:17:18,630
Crystal Peak. You have
to get to Crystal Peak.

582
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,960
- What is he saying?
- Crystal Peak.

583
01:17:21,130 --> 01:17:23,800
A hardened facility
in the Sierra Nevada mountains.

584
01:17:23,970 --> 01:17:27,740
Fifty-two miles northeast,
bearing 0.5 degrees.

585
01:17:27,910 --> 01:17:29,600
That's the system core?

586
01:17:30,180 --> 01:17:32,300
It's your only chance.

587
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:37,440
You'll need a plane. The particle accelerator
leads to the runway.

588
01:17:39,450 --> 01:17:41,210
Take care of my daughter.

589
01:17:43,620 --> 01:17:47,020
Oh, Katie, I am sorry.

590
01:17:47,190 --> 01:17:50,490
I opened Pandora's box.

591
01:17:51,660 --> 01:17:52,650
Get down!

592
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:11,450
There's nothing you can do. Come on.

593
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:13,740
We must go. It is not safe here.

594
01:18:14,490 --> 01:18:16,950
Kate, we have to go.

595
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:20,820
Kate! He wanted you to come with me.

596
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:25,190
He wanted us to shut Skynet down.
Come on.

597
01:18:26,970 --> 01:18:28,400
Come on.

598
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:42,010
Run!

599
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:18,230
Let's go.

600
01:21:29,610 --> 01:21:32,480
That's it. We can follow it
out to the runway.

601
01:21:32,650 --> 01:21:34,380
Come on.

602
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:32,270
What?

603
01:22:33,580 --> 01:22:35,310
Nothing.

604
01:22:36,310 --> 01:22:38,540
You remind me of my mother.

605
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:58,370
Oh, God. She's coming.

606
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:03,810
What are you doing?

607
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:05,930
Powering up.

608
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:12,240
Come on.

609
01:24:22,850 --> 01:24:24,220
It's working.

610
01:24:28,860 --> 01:24:31,420
Just die, you bitch!

611
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:36,900
Come on.

612
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:55,910
There's my father's plane.
I trained on it.

613
01:26:06,930 --> 01:26:09,160
Yes! He made it.

614
01:26:11,130 --> 01:26:13,120
Get away from me.

615
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:16,620
Leave!

616
01:26:18,370 --> 01:26:19,500
Now!

617
01:26:19,940 --> 01:26:21,130
Let's go!

618
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:29,170
- The master's on. Throttle's set.
- Come on. Let's go.

619
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:38,210
Oh, please. You can't do this.

620
01:26:38,390 --> 01:26:40,020
I have no choice.

621
01:26:40,930 --> 01:26:43,290
The T-X...

622
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:45,930
...has corrupted my system.

623
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,630
You can't kill a human being.
You said so yourself.

624
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,640
Let him go!

625
01:26:59,310 --> 01:27:01,110
You're fighting it right now.

626
01:27:01,980 --> 01:27:04,070
My CPU is intact.

627
01:27:04,650 --> 01:27:08,450
But I cannot control my other functions.

628
01:27:08,620 --> 01:27:12,250
You don't have to do this.
You don't want to do this!

629
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:16,780
Desire is irrelevant.

630
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:19,520
I am a machine.

631
01:27:36,110 --> 01:27:37,780
What is your mission?

632
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:43,080
To ensure the survival of John Connor...

633
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:45,280
...and Katherine Brewster.

634
01:27:50,630 --> 01:27:53,830
You are about to fail that mission!

635
01:28:00,710 --> 01:28:03,500
I can- I cannot.

636
01:28:04,610 --> 01:28:06,740
You know what you have to do.

637
01:28:08,710 --> 01:28:11,270
You know my destiny.

638
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:17,080
I have to live.

639
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:00,320
- Are you okay?
- What happened?

640
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:03,130
He couldn't do it.
He shut himself down.

641
01:29:06,870 --> 01:29:09,470
- Can you fly?
- Yeah.

642
01:29:36,870 --> 01:29:39,060
Okay. 015 degrees...

643
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:43,470
...52 miles, our max air speed
is about 160.

644
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:46,040
We've got 32 minutes.

645
01:29:46,210 --> 01:29:48,040
It's just you and me now.

646
01:29:48,210 --> 01:29:50,680
What if we can't stop it?

647
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:54,910
There's enough C-4 here
to take out 10 supercomputers.

648
01:29:55,350 --> 01:29:57,690
We're gonna make it, Kate.

649
01:29:58,890 --> 01:30:01,260
The future is up to us.

650
01:30:07,700 --> 01:30:09,930
That's gotta be it.

651
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:16,160
Skynet. There may be more of them.

652
01:31:34,050 --> 01:31:35,850
Come on.

653
01:31:50,070 --> 01:31:53,260
I think this is some kind of blast door.

654
01:31:56,370 --> 01:31:59,040
There's no way
we can blow through this thing.

655
01:32:00,310 --> 01:32:01,300
John, look.

656
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:05,720
Now what?

657
01:32:08,550 --> 01:32:10,890
It's a code prompt.

658
01:32:18,030 --> 01:32:21,060
Type in "Dakota 775."

659
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,570
"Red 176."

660
01:32:48,590 --> 01:32:50,930
Come on!
We gotta get this thing open.

661
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:53,030
Here. It's "Avalon 412."

662
01:32:53,930 --> 01:32:55,260
Put it in!

663
01:33:29,630 --> 01:33:31,070
Come on!

664
01:33:47,590 --> 01:33:49,080
I'm back.

665
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:06,660
Go! Now!

666
01:34:07,270 --> 01:34:08,260
Come on!

667
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:33,690
- Thank you.
- We'll meet again.

668
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:35,120
Go!

669
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:37,290
Come on!

670
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:23,400
You are terminated.

671
01:35:55,610 --> 01:35:56,940
The elevator.

672
01:36:03,550 --> 01:36:05,950
I'll set the detonator for five minutes.

673
01:36:06,460 --> 01:36:08,890
That should give us enough time
to get back up.

674
01:36:40,260 --> 01:36:41,990
What is this place?

675
01:37:22,700 --> 01:37:25,190
These computers are 30 years old.

676
01:37:33,710 --> 01:37:35,540
This isn't Skynet.

677
01:37:40,220 --> 01:37:42,050
There's nothing here.

678
01:37:47,220 --> 01:37:50,060
This is a fallout shelter for VIPs.

679
01:37:51,900 --> 01:37:54,230
Only they never got the warning.

680
01:37:58,900 --> 01:38:00,560
Goddamn it!

681
01:38:02,910 --> 01:38:05,400
There's nothing here!

682
01:38:24,930 --> 01:38:26,760
Why didn't he tell us?

683
01:38:30,100 --> 01:38:32,530
Why did he lead us down here?

684
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:39,940
To live.

685
01:38:41,110 --> 01:38:43,100
That was his mission.

686
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:59,120
There was never any stopping it.

687
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:04,130
John...

688
01:39:05,470 --> 01:39:07,130
...we could just...

689
01:39:07,970 --> 01:39:09,300
...let it go.

690
01:39:12,140 --> 01:39:13,470
Hello?

691
01:39:14,280 --> 01:39:16,470
Hello? Can somebody hear me?

692
01:39:17,580 --> 01:39:19,410
This is Montana Civil Defense.

693
01:39:20,990 --> 01:39:23,150
Somebody please come in.

694
01:39:23,650 --> 01:39:25,320
Is there anybody there?

695
01:39:25,660 --> 01:39:28,650
Anyone reading me? Over.

696
01:39:29,830 --> 01:39:34,090
Rumors about a launch sequence.
Command and control have broken down.

697
01:39:35,330 --> 01:39:38,430
Is anyone receiving me?
Somebody?

698
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:42,500
Somebody please come in.

699
01:39:42,940 --> 01:39:44,270
Anybody out there?

700
01:39:44,510 --> 01:39:47,840
- This is SAC Nellis. We're under attack.
- CQ? CQ?

701
01:39:48,110 --> 01:39:49,670
Is anybody there?

702
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:55,350
This is John Connor at Crystal Peak.

703
01:39:56,290 --> 01:40:01,020
Connor? What the hell is happening?
Who's in charge there?

704
01:40:07,870 --> 01:40:09,200
I am.

705
01:40:10,530 --> 01:40:12,870
Connor, can you help us?

706
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:18,040
This is Montana Civil Defense.
Where did you say you were again?

707
01:40:21,380 --> 01:40:24,210
By the time Skynet
became self-aware...

708
01:40:24,550 --> 01:40:28,880
...it had spread into millions
of computer servers across the planet.

709
01:40:29,650 --> 01:40:34,560
Ordinary computers in office buildings,
dorm rooms, everywhere.

710
01:40:36,390 --> 01:40:40,060
It was software and cyberspace.

711
01:40:41,270 --> 01:40:46,070
There was no system core.
It could not be shut down.

712
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:52,400
The attack began at 6:18 p. m.,
just as he said it would.

713
01:40:53,410 --> 01:40:55,070
Judgment Day.

714
01:40:55,910 --> 01:40:58,440
The day the human race
was nearly destroyed...

715
01:40:58,620 --> 01:41:01,350
...by weapons they'd built
to protect themselves.

716
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:08,920
I should have realized our destiny
was never to stop Judgment Day.

717
01:41:09,930 --> 01:41:12,420
It was merely to survive it...

718
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:15,220
...together.

719
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:20,430
The Terminator knew.

720
01:41:20,940 --> 01:41:23,430
He tried to tell us...

721
01:41:24,270 --> 01:41:26,970
...but I didn't want to hear it.

722
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:33,270
Maybe the future has been written.
I don't know.

723
01:41:34,280 --> 01:41:36,950
All I know is what
the Terminator taught me:

724
01:41:37,620 --> 01:41:39,950
Never stop fighting.

725
01:41:40,120 --> 01:41:42,790
And I never will.

726
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:48,750
The battle has just begun.
