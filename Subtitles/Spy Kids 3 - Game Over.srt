2
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,660
Agua. As in water.

3
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,580
Cute. But I wasn't here for cute.

4
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,290
I was here 'cause I'd gotten
a call for my regular fee.

5
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,170
$4.99.

6
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,630
I'm an ex-secret agent.

7
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,760
My name is Juni Cortez.

8
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,300
And I'm a private detective.

9
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:29,430
A P.I.
A private eye.

10
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,890
A gumshoe.

11
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:39,980
I know why the water
from your park is missing.

12
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,700
- Pray tell.
- It's winter.

13
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,820
They shut down the park
during the winter.

14
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,870
Who's "they"?

15
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:51,950
The people who really own this park.

16
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,460
Times are tough.

17
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,210
But a guy's gotta do what he's gotta do.

18
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,590
From saving cats in trees...

19
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,010
...to finding lost toys.

20
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,270
To helping people...
Hold on.

21
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,350
Yeah?

22
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,400
The OSS is looking for me?

23
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,980
Look, I'm no longer an agent.
I can't help you.

24
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,440
Whatever it is, it's your problem.

25
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,110
Leave me alone!

26
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:30,450
I'd been burned by the agency.
The OSS.

27
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,080
So I left.
No going back.

28
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,960
I handle my own assignments now.

29
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,920
Smaller in scale.

30
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:42,130
I was saving up for something big.

31
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,420
I was standing in line

32
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:47,510
to buy my copy of the biggest
virtual-reality game in history.

33
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:52,470
It goes online at midnight.
Pretty exciting. I suppose.

34
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,980
Game Over.

35
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,770
The biggest video game
to ever be created. Period.

36
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,440
This is a worldwide event.

37
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,230
The game was created by someone
known only as the Toymaker.

38
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,610
Who was once again
unavailable for interviews.

39
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:13,620
But there's gotta be some things
more important than games.

40
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,750
Oh. And did we mention
the surprises the Toymaker has in store

41
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,670
for those of you that complete level five?

42
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:31,180
Untold riches. Toys. And prizes
beyond your wildest dreams.

43
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,640
Hey, no cutting in line, freak.

44
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,180
I wasn't cutting.
I was standing right here!

45
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:37,980
End of the line!

46
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,810
Needless to say.

47
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,070
Things have been pretty lame
since I left the OSS.

48
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,700
Things were about to get worse.

49
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,000
Dear Juni.

50
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,090
I was doing some work
and thought you might like these.

51
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:08,800
Miniaturized sharks.

52
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,510
Remember. They're still man-eaters. So
don't be poking your fingers in the bowl.

53
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,850
Take care. If you guys
ever need anything. I'll be there.

54
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:18,810
Romero.

55
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:22,440
Ralph, write a thank-you note
back to Romero.

56
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,370
Behave, you guys.
No fighting.

57
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,880
- Whatcha doin'?
- Hi, Gerti.

58
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:53,430
I'm just doing nothing... again.

59
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,930
- What's that?
- Mexican chocolate.

60
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,730
- Where's your mom and dad?
- On an assignment.

61
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:04,060
It was my idea not to be
part of the family business.

62
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,150
They're all on missions.
Your sister, too, huh?

63
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:11,240
I haven't seen Carmen
since Christmas... last year.

64
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,120
You should join back up.
The OSS could really use you.

65
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,950
- Yeah. Use me.
- Not what I meant.

66
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,500
Don't hold on to the past, Juni.
Look at me.

67
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,540
9 years old and nowhere to go but up.

68
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:26,250
The only tribe worth belonging to
is the one that you're born into.

69
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,260
Yeah, your family.
It's good to take care of your family.

70
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,510
But remember one thing.

71
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,930
Everyone's your family.

72
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,890
That makes no sense.

73
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,150
Hello, Juni.

74
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,770
Mr. President.

75
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,650
Oh, you can call me Devlin.

76
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:51,320
Weren't you already running the country
when you were head of the OSS?

77
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,610
I was running the country.

78
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,780
But since the OSS is a secret
organization, no one knew it.

79
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,290
I wanted the world to know
that I was in charge.

80
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,830
So I became president
of the United States.

81
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,460
It all depends upon your preference.

82
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,290
Reality or perception.
Perception works for me.

83
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,710
Well, I'm into reality.

84
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,340
And the reality is, nothing you can say

85
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:16,720
will make me rejoin the OSS.
That is why you called, isn't it?

86
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,810
The OSS needs you to return.

87
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,350
I'm retired.

88
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,600
Well, who's living in perception now?

89
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,890
The fact is there is no retirement.

90
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,560
Once an agent, always an agent.

91
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:29,020
It's time for you to be a big boy
and reinstate.

92
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,570
With all due respect, sir, no.

93
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:36,530
Then hold on to your seat,
because here's the reality:

94
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,830
Your sister's missing.

95
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:51,000
Taking Agent Cortez
to Games and Theory.

96
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:53,920
That's ex-Agent Cortez.

97
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:59,390
You know,
that one's defective.

98
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:02,470
Something's wrong with the shape.

99
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,680
See if we can take that one back.

100
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,310
Oh, man.

101
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,610
We're on.

102
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,070
We're on!

103
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,450
Hello, Juni.

104
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:22,330
Donnagon. Been a good boy lately?

105
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,620
Yes.

106
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,620
Very, very good.

107
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,580
Mrs. Giggles must have
straightened you out.

108
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:33,130
- I certainly did.
- Hello, Francesca.

109
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:36,380
Yeah, she worked me over
pretty good, actually.

110
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:39,050
- Aah.
- Darling, behave.

111
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,430
What do you know about
a video game called Game Over?

112
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:46,430
I know that just about every kid
in the world is gonna sign on and play it.

113
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,560
Not if we can help it.
The game is a trap.

114
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,940
Once plugged into the game,

115
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,490
parents won't even be able to
get their children's attention.

116
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:56,940
What else is new?

117
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,070
This is different.

118
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:02,120
Once you get through the game,
your mind belongs to the Toymaker.

119
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,620
The inventor of the game.

120
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,120
He wants to enslave
the world's youth with mind control.

121
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,630
You control the youth,
you control the future of the world.

122
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:14,750
She's an ingenious hacker, your sister.

123
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,380
We sent her inside to shut down the game.

124
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:21,470
But... she disappeared.

125
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:24,100
How can she disappear inside a game?

126
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,810
She didn't physically.

127
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:28,480
Actually, she's right here in the building.

128
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,480
Carmen! Carmen!

129
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,190
She can't hear you.
Her mind's still in the game.

130
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,990
She got as far as level four, then nothing.

131
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:43,030
Why would she even go in there
without any backup?

132
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,790
Because her first and only choice
wouldn't answer our calls.

133
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,830
So she decided to go alone.

134
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,460
Now, you go in.
Find your sister.

135
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,380
Help her shut down the game in 12 hours,

136
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,090
or it's game over for everyone.

137
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:03,140
Are you with us?

138
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,260
OK.

139
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,760
Then let's go.

140
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,520
So I have to shut down the game
but not release the Toymaker?

141
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,650
Exactly. It would be catastrophic
if he escaped.

142
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:19,690
The Toymaker hates us for imprisoning
him in cyberspace all these years.

143
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,820
- What made you do that?
- Who knows? It was years ago.

144
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,160
Now, you'll have to start
on level one like everyone else.

145
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,870
Find your sister on level four.
Then proceed to level five.

146
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,670
- Which is unwinnable.
- Level five is unwinnable?

147
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,830
Level five is where
you shut down the game.

148
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,500
If the game is not shut down,

149
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:41,260
you'll stay trapped with everyone else
when the Toymaker takes over the world.

150
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,140
Put on these glasses,

151
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,810
and you'll enter the world of the game.

152
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,060
You're being sent into a zero-gravity
chamber alongside Carmen.

153
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,150
That should give you a competitive edge.

154
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,530
When you're in the game,
things will feel real.

155
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:00,650
Are they real?

156
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,200
Good luck, Juni.

157
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,200
Find Carmen.
Shut down the game.

158
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,330
And whatever you do,
don't let the Toymaker out.

159
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,900
Computer-generated.

160
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,190
Low-res!

161
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,660
Carmen.
Carmen. Can you hear me?

162
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,410
It's Juni. Your brother.

163
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,540
Pogo Toads!

164
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,980
Hey! Get your own ride, creepo!

165
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,520
Sorry!
I thought you were a toad.

166
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,150
New player, huh?

167
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,190
Yeah.
New player.

168
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,700
Well, here's a lesson you won't soon forget.

169
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,590
How is he?

170
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,590
His brain waves are normal.

171
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,260
But how is he?

172
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,050
Oh. He fell.

173
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,730
Stand up.

174
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,860
You fell three stories.

175
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,070
Aah. I survived?

176
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,700
Not exactly.
That is your life count.

177
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:00,370
After taking heavy damage. You lose a life.

178
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,290
What happens when I hit zero?

179
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,340
Game over.

180
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:09,760
When you run out of life. You lose.
No replays. No restarts.

181
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:15,050
What happened to my 12 hours?
I only have four now.

182
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:18,060
Time flies when you're playing games.

183
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,730
This is crazy.

184
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,560
Better hurry.

185
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,040
So who are you?

186
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:49,630
I'm Juni Cortez,
ex-secret agent of the OSS.

187
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,970
I need to get to level five.

188
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:56,050
But I only have a few hours before
the Toymaker takes over the world.

189
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,350
- Level five?
- Level five is unwinnable.

190
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:01,600
I understand that.
But I have to save the world.

191
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,610
Rez, this person thinks
he's level-five material.

192
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,400
So I hear.

193
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,820
You guys must be beta testers.

194
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:16,370
One of the first allowed to roam free
these coveted digital hills, my friend.

195
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:18,830
How can I offer service?

196
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:21,040
I'm Rez.

197
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,080
Hi, Rez.
Now, about saving the world.

198
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,750
If anyone's gonna get
to the great prize at level five,

199
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,090
it's gonna be one of us.

200
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,170
Whatever.
I want cheat codes.

201
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:35,840
Back-door entrances.
Shortcuts. Anything.

202
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:38,430
I can pay you with bonus packs.

203
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:42,270
Implementation of any form
of hack code or cheat boost

204
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,020
will trigger an immediate game over

205
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,980
and permanent evac from the game.

206
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,230
It's in your tech manual.

207
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:50,530
You have to play the game by the rules

208
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,150
or not at all.

209
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,530
All right.

210
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:56,820
How do I get to level two
as quickly as possible?

211
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:59,450
Lives are at stake. Please.

212
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:02,370
See that target? Hit it.

213
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,080
You'll bounce straight to the moon.

214
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,830
Yeah. I'd suggest a running start.

215
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,130
Level two is on the dark side
of the moon.

216
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:13,010
The way to get there is by hitting
that target and bouncing to it.

217
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:17,640
Not a lot of realism
in these games, is there?

218
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:25,520
Won't be seeing him anymore.
Let's go.

219
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,690
Less competition, the better.

220
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,470
Oh, great.

221
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:06,310
A message from the OSS.
Do you accept?

222
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,900
Mm-hm.

223
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,730
OK, Juni, we can no longer be
of assistance.

224
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,900
What assistance?

225
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,990
You do get one additional lifeline,

226
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,070
which you can choose to use now
or later.

227
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,320
Now!
Give it to me now.

228
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:23,450
You get to bring in
any one person from the outside

229
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:24,950
to help you on your journey.

230
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,660
Call up the family files.

231
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,210
Assertive. Athletic.
Knows karate.

232
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:30,250
Intelligent.

233
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,630
Strategic.

234
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,750
Knows karate.

235
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:35,760
Wait a minute.
Go back to Grandpa.

236
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,170
Pros. Superior intellect.

237
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,590
Cons. Physically disabled.

238
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,640
He's been paralyzed
from the waist down for 30 years.

239
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,930
His energy force would have
doubled back again,

240
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:50,480
making his arms, his heart, his brain
twice as strong as a normal person.

241
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,650
- What are you thinking. Sir?
- I choose Grandpa.

242
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:56,190
Selected. One moment.

243
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,120
That was fast. Sort of.

244
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:06,660
Grandpa!

245
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,580
Juni!

246
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,910
Where am I?

247
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,170
In a video game run by a madman
called the Toymaker.

248
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,420
The Toymaker is here?

249
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,710
You know him?

250
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:22,260
I've been hunting him down
for 30 years, Juni.

251
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:27,100
- You shouldn't have brought me here.
- I needed your help.

252
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,600
We have to find Carmen
and shut down the game.

253
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,060
What is that?

254
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,070
It's a power-up of some kind.

255
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,030
Mega Legs.

256
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,990
Give it to me.

257
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,540
Grandpa?

258
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,550
You can walk.

259
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:05,300
No, Juni.

260
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:16,400
Oh, I can do more than that.

261
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,610
Wow.

262
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,030
Hmm.

263
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,790
Grandpa?

264
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,830
Hmm.

265
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,920
Where are you going?

266
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,760
Don't wait for me, Juni.
I'll catch up with you.

267
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,550
But we have to find...

268
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,180
Carmen.

269
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,060
Valentin, my old friend.

270
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:57,810
You think you'll catch me
this time, don't you?

271
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,860
Well...

272
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:04,150
you will.

273
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,950
Oh, you will.

274
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,710
Everything falls into place.

275
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:22,420
Everything falls.

276
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:02,880
A courageous new contestant.
Welcome to the Robocon.

277
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,130
I need to get to level two.

278
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,090
Well, you came to the wrong place.

279
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,800
This is the Arena of Misfortune.

280
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,390
To get to level two, you're gonna
have to battle a Mech.

281
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,470
How do I do that?

282
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:14,100
I'll explain it to you
when you get up there.

283
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,440
Hey, there.

284
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,820
Just go out there
in your Battle Mech and fight.

285
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,950
Wait a minute.
Who am I fighting?

286
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,660
Her.

287
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:49,090
Don't get too trashed
and I win bonus points.

288
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,070
Right foot, left foot.

289
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:07,440
Right foot. Oh!

290
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:11,410
Oh! How do you work this thing?

291
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,510
OK. I want a good. Clean robo fight.

292
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:33,890
There will be no kidney punches.
No rabbit punches.

293
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:36,220
No eye gouging or ear biting.

294
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:39,680
Unless. Of course. You can't help yourself.

295
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,690
Hi.

296
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,570
I'm Juni.

297
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,320
Oh, I'm sorry.

298
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,820
I'm sorry. He didn't mean it.

299
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,280
Really, really.

300
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,580
No. No, no, no!

301
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,740
Please, no!

302
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:26,060
Hi. I'm Demetra.

303
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,000
Help.

304
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,440
Oh! That's gotta hurt.

305
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,180
I'm the winner!

306
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,380
Yeah!

307
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:02,390
Whoo! Yes!

308
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:04,430
Well, well, well.

309
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:07,480
For a kid that doesn't know how to fight,

310
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,770
you sure know how to fight.

311
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:13,400
Congratulations.
And keep the suit.

312
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,480
Hey! Hey!

313
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,950
Hey!

314
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:24,200
So, let's go over this again, shall we?

315
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,080
So there's no mistake.
So there's no gross error.

316
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,500
So there's no lack
of communication amongst us.

317
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:33,500
What I want, what we want...

318
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,500
What do we want?

319
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:39,880
Our time on this planet is over.
It belongs now to our youth.

320
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:42,550
Not if we control their minds!

321
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,180
We could start the world over again
and cure it of its diseases.

322
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,930
We could begin anew.

323
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:58,990
Forget what we could do!
It's what we should do!

324
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:02,990
Am I doing the right thing?

325
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:07,240
It's not about the right thing.
It's about the smart thing.

326
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,080
Ah.

327
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,960
We won't escape this place otherwise.

328
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,960
I speak for all of us
when I say, "We want out!"

329
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,340
Hmm.

330
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,630
The end justifies the means.

331
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:20,880
You have the children's attention.

332
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:24,260
The question is,
what are you teaching them?

333
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,010
Who are you people?

334
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,680
We are you.

335
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,770
Forgive me. Forgive me.

336
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:36,190
I forget the extent of my
programming powers from time to time.

337
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:41,860
For a moment, I actually
believed that you existed.

338
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:45,820
Goodbye.

339
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,490
Out, out, out.

340
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,950
Out, out.

341
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,790
This childish game will soon be over.

342
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:58,630
And then the real game will begin.

343
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,940
Will you look at this?

344
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:29,410
Hold on to your joysticks, boys.
I think we got him.

345
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,870
You're the Guy.

346
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,040
I'm the who?

347
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,250
The Guy.
The guy from the poster.

348
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,960
That guy.

349
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:43,840
No. Wait a minute.

350
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,840
I'm only looking for my sister.
She's somewhere on level four.

351
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:51,100
Then I'm heading out through level five.

352
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,140
So you can win the game?

353
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:56,190
I guess that's one way of putting it.

354
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:59,810
You see, according to the tech manual,

355
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,650
if we find the Guy...

356
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:04,400
the Guy...

357
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,740
he'll lead us through the unwinnable level.

358
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:09,200
Just 'cause he made it
out of Robocon in one piece

359
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,620
doesn't mean he's the Guy.

360
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,790
He's the first I've seen
to make it out with the power suit.

361
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:17,580
Man, give me a break.
This wimp's a phony.

362
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:20,880
There's only one way to find out.

363
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,260
Mega Race.

364
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:27,970
The fastest, most dangerous race
in the game world.

365
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:29,260
- Come on.
- No. Wait.

366
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,470
I already told you I'm not the Guy.

367
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,390
- Go.
- OK.

368
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,730
The race will begin shortly.

369
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:40,100
Claim your vehicle.

370
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,820
You got to be kidding.

371
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,870
This race will tell us if you're the Guy.

372
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:54,990
If you are, you can hang with us.

373
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,830
But if you're a phony, Arnold will crush you.

374
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,880
Aah!

375
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,630
I'm not the Guy.

376
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:06,170
How many times do I have to say it?

377
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:08,550
There are
no rules in this race.

378
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:12,090
Except win at any cost.

379
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:14,970
All right!

380
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:46,500
We'll try to help you out...
as much as we can.

381
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,760
The race will begin... now.

382
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,010
One. Two. Three. Go!

383
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:21,000
- Easy as pie.
- Juni, push the red button.

384
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,880
The one that says "Do not push"?

385
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,250
Yeah. Push it.
It's a turbo boost.

386
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,500
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

387
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:44,400
Hey, Rez, give me a hand!

388
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,980
Hey, how about a foot?

389
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,580
My turn, sucker.

390
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,590
You're supposed to be
winning the race, Juni.

391
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,380
Grandpa!

392
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,120
What is this?

393
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,660
Nngh!

394
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,120
Oh!

395
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,620
The glove!

396
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,580
Grab the glove.

397
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,580
The glove!

398
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:53,080
Grab another bike, Juni!

399
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,470
Final stretch!

400
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:33,960
Five... four...

401
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,460
three... two... one.

402
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,340
Winner by a hubcap. Juni Cortez!

403
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,570
- I thought you were him.
- I knew it.

404
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,910
I guess you are.

405
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:15,670
So, I hear you're the Guy.

406
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:18,630
I am definitely the Guy.

407
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:19,880
Yeah!

408
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,920
Yeah!

409
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:24,430
Yeah!

410
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:42,240
- So now what, Guy?
- I have to go talk to my grandfather.

411
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,070
To who?

412
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:46,740
I mean I must confer

413
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:52,160
with the Wizard of Atari-Sega-Nendo.

414
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,210
Yeah. OK, cool.

415
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:04,880
Congratulations. You won the race.

416
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:08,550
But now they think I'm some important guy
who's going to win for them.

417
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,100
For our purposes, that's very good.

418
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,730
They can lead us to level four
more quickly,

419
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,270
so you can find your sister,

420
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:20,270
so we can shut down the game
and make things right.

421
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:24,900
And so that I can find...

422
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:27,110
the Toymaker.

423
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,740
We're not supposed to
get near the Toymaker.

424
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:35,500
So say the rules of the OSS,

425
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,750
which I'm not following.

426
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:40,960
He might escape.
We can't risk that.

427
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,670
Oh, no, Juni.

428
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:47,340
I don't plan on letting him go anywhere.

429
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:49,640
Guy!

430
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,970
We'll talk about this later.

431
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,430
OK. Here it is.

432
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:57,520
I'm not supposed to lead you to level five.

433
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,650
You're supposed to lead me there.

434
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:01,730
So you mean we work together?

435
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:06,240
The wizard said if we all work together,
we all win.

436
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,700
With my strength.

437
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,360
My brains.

438
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:12,490
My cool.

439
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:14,950
My intuition.

440
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:19,960
OK. So you're the Guy.
We're all counting on you.

441
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:23,460
But if you fail us or if you're
not who you say you are,

442
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:27,760
this life counter will hit zero
faster than you can say "oops."

443
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,130
Deal.

444
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,640
First I got to find my sister.

445
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,260
So level four, people.

446
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:36,270
Move!

447
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,360
Come on, Grandpa.

448
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,320
He's doing good, huh?
Huh?

449
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,280
Yeah, he's doing great,
and that's the problem.

450
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,280
Why?

451
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,700
They've awoken the Programmerz.

452
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:55,790
What?

453
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,210
- Pull him out of there now.
- Too late.

454
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,630
All right. This is cool.

455
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,800
We'll get there in no time.

456
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,760
What is this?

457
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,680
Wait a minute.

458
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,060
The Programmerz.

459
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:24,480
Who are these Programmerz?

460
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,690
The brainiacs who wrote
the book for the game.

461
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:31,360
So, they work for the Toymaker, huh?

462
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:33,910
Programmerz are the reason
you found us on level one.

463
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:36,410
They caught Francis cheating
during the Mega Race.

464
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:39,200
They'll bounce us back
to level one again if they catch us.

465
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:42,080
Level one? I don't have time for that.

466
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,170
Spread out.

467
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,380
Don't split up! It never works!

468
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,590
If we just stick together...

469
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:55,140
All right, Grandpa.
I guess it's just you and me.

470
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,890
Hello?

471
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,270
Grandpa?

472
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,900
- Psst!
- Aah!

473
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:13,110
Can you at least try and act
like you're the Guy?

474
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,160
You know my secret?

475
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,580
I've seen the real Guy, and you're not him.

476
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:22,250
Why are Programmerz chasing us?

477
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:24,000
Someone's got a game cheat.

478
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,170
What's this?

479
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,750
A map to the game.

480
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:28,420
This is illegal.

481
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,130
You want to find your sister or not?

482
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:34,180
Give me the map.

483
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,350
- OK.
- Wow.

484
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:38,810
We're in Machine City.

485
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:41,850
If we cut across here,
we'll be able to reach level four.

486
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:43,430
Where Carmen is.

487
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,520
Right.

488
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,480
Then, if we cut through Lava Mountain,

489
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,020
we'll be right at the door
of the unwinnable level.

490
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:54,030
Shortcuts. This is good.
This is very good.

491
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:56,610
Game cheats.

492
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:00,120
That's against the rules.

493
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:06,620
We're gonna have to bounce you
back to level one.

494
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,500
- Aah!
- You can't scare us. He's the Guy.

495
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:11,300
Grandpa!

496
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:16,760
Listen to that, Edog.
The Guy is calling his grandpa.

497
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:20,390
I'm so scared.
Come and get me, Gramps.

498
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:23,140
What's he gonna do, drool on us?

499
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:27,020
Why are you picking on my grandson?

500
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,150
Why?

501
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,820
They got Logos and Edog, the leaders.

502
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,150
You are Programmerz?

503
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,280
Let's see what you really look like, huh?

504
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,370
Very unimpressive.

505
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,830
Computer nerds.

506
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,380
Now tell me, where is the Toymaker?

507
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:55,170
Grandpa... uh, Wizard, put them down!

508
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:11,020
He's good.

509
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:14,110
The boy warrior is very, very good.

510
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:15,740
But he's got to keep going.

511
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,700
We run the risk of discouraging him

512
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:20,620
if the next levels are too challenging.

513
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,450
But only by seeking challenges

514
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:25,750
can we hope to find the best in ourselves.

515
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:26,950
Can we help him?

516
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,250
No! It's against the rules of the game!

517
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:31,500
This isn't a game.

518
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:34,590
It's life!

519
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,800
I don't mind talking to myself.

520
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:42,470
But when you guys start to
cut me out of the conversation,

521
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:45,930
that's when it gets a little strange.

522
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:50,270
That's it.
More life is what we need.

523
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:55,190
We'll grant the boy a gift.
The gift of life.

524
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:03,320
Don't worry, Guy.

525
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:05,120
From here on out, I'll protect you.

526
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:08,410
Are you all right, Guy?

527
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,580
Hey. He found a life pack.

528
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:12,750
A what?

529
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:14,090
That's rare.

530
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:16,460
I've never seen one up close before.

531
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:17,960
What do I do?

532
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:21,720
Crush it in your hands.
You'll gain life.

533
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,640
How much?

534
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,680
All depends.

535
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:32,310
I got extra life, Demetra.

536
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,650
Congratulations.
You'll need it the most.

537
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,610
I want you to take it.

538
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,900
Juni, I can't.

539
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,750
Does he know what that's worth?

540
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:53,750
Of course he does.

541
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:58,130
I owed you from the Robot Arena.

542
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:02,970
Also, I don't want anything
to happen to you.

543
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:04,550
Thank you.

544
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:13,440
You have now entered level three.

545
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:23,990
I wish my family
could see this amazing place.

546
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:26,870
What are you doing in the game, Arnold?

547
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,710
Well, actually, I got in
on a beta tester's visa.

548
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,720
I'm here for the great prize
behind level five.

549
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,840
It'll save my family from poverty.

550
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:47,890
But what waits for us in level five?

551
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:50,970
I mean, is it all true?
Untold riches?

552
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,940
Arnold, you should know

553
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:56,310
that when we reach the end of the game--

554
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,860
No. Don't tell me.

555
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:02,240
I want it to be a surprise.

556
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,780
- I'm sure it will be.

557
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:06,240
Attention. Gamers!

558
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,240
Stand on the red line.

559
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:12,910
Choose your best player.

560
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:16,500
The Guy.
The Guy's the best.

561
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:20,550
Choose your strongest player.

562
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:22,210
That'd be Arnold.

563
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,230
Survival of the fittest.

564
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:40,770
Face your opponent.

565
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:45,950
Wait a minute.
I'm not fighting Arnold.

566
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:47,780
I don't want to crush Juni.

567
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:50,910
The winner shall proceed
with the others to level four.

568
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:53,410
The loser shall be given
an immediate game over

569
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:57,870
and will be evacuated
permanently from the game.

570
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,590
Arnold, I have to save my sister.

571
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:02,750
I'm sorry, Juni.

572
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:05,590
But I have my own family to think about.

573
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:08,720
I can't beat you, Arnold.

574
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:14,310
I know.

575
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:17,310
Fight!

576
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,730
Not that I'm rooting for anyone in particular,

577
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:04,400
but that was a really cool move.

578
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,750
Nice knowing you, Juni.

579
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,210
Arnold, please!

580
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,220
What's going on?

581
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:39,060
You've been tagged.

582
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:41,020
What do you mean, I've been tagged?

583
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:44,150
Someone has switched places with you.

584
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:47,940
Not me, Guy.

585
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,950
Demetra, what are you doing?

586
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:55,120
You have to find your sister, Juni.

587
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:57,490
Don't! Don't do it!

588
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:01,830
Demetra, no!

589
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:03,170
Fight!

590
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,130
- No!
- Aah!

591
00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:16,140
Demetra. Game over!

592
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:25,400
I never even got her e-mail address.

593
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:32,950
Don't fall in love with a game, Juni.

594
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,700
Let's get out of here.

595
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:41,620
Sorry, Juni.

596
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:44,670
My family.

597
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:55,590
You are causing so much pain.

598
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,760
And only I can stop you.

599
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:03,350
For I know why you do these things...

600
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:06,400
Toymaker.

601
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,360
Bring it on.

602
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:14,950
Find me, and the world
will truly pay the price.

603
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:20,700
Here in my cyberprison
I was forced to create.

604
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:25,670
Now I will destroy.

605
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:30,550
Release the girl.
Put her back in the game.

606
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:32,880
But, sir--

607
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,090
Oh, you have a better solution, don't you?

608
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:37,760
Of course you do. You all do.

609
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,800
So tell me.
What is the real answer?

610
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:42,350
- I'm so curious.
- Revenge.

611
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:44,350
- Healing.
- Destruction!

612
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:45,850
- Love.
- Hate.

613
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:47,020
Uh-huh.

614
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:49,610
Well, once again, you're all correct.

615
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:53,230
And once again, you're all incorrect.

616
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:02,370
On with the game.

617
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:10,540
You are now entering level four.

618
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:13,420
Level four? Wait a minute.

619
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:16,130
Carmen's on this level.

620
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:26,350
I'll use telepathy.

621
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:28,770
We might be close enough that it'll work.

622
00:49:28,850 --> 00:49:30,730
Carmen. Can you hear me?

623
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:32,690
What?

624
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:34,730
This game plays tricks.

625
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:37,570
Tell me something
only Carmen would say.

626
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:40,070
My feet stink.

627
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:42,580
You sound close.

628
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:44,620
I am.

629
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:02,390
I see you brought Grandpa into the game.

630
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:04,720
I thought it was a good idea at the time.

631
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,680
Juni!

632
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:10,140
The Toymaker's the guy
who put Grandpa in the wheelchair

633
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:12,150
30 years ago.

634
00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:13,900
Exactly.

635
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:17,780
If Grandpa tries to take revenge,
the Toymaker will break free.

636
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:19,610
He's that powerful.

637
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:24,370
Then we have to convince Grandpa
that revenge is not the way to solve it.

638
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:26,410
OK, Guy. We found your pal.

639
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:29,330
Now, where are we going, exactly?
Where's level five?

640
00:50:29,410 --> 00:50:31,830
First of all, you don't
ask the questions around here.

641
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,920
I do. Second of all--

642
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,960
- We're going to Lava Mountain.
- We are?

643
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,510
Beyond that is the passage to level five.

644
00:50:40,590 --> 00:50:41,680
I don't think so.

645
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,050
Oh, so suddenly you're the game expert.

646
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:46,310
We're following the Guy.

647
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:51,810
You know, Juni, we don't need
these guys following us.

648
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:53,150
Not where we're going.

649
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:55,310
I promised them they could tag along.

650
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:59,320
Look, this is how I know where to go.
Trust me.

651
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,160
Lava Mountain.

652
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:07,450
Why is it that every video game
has lava in it?

653
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:09,250
Technically, that's not true.

654
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:11,290
There's no lava in Halo.

655
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:13,460
And in Metroid, it's molten magma.

656
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:16,210
Can't touch the lava, or it's game over.

657
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:17,800
But I have six lives left.

658
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:20,470
Doesn't matter.
You fall in, you lose.

659
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:23,010
The game's getting tougher, guys.

660
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:24,510
This is impossible.

661
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:27,560
What do you think, Grandpa?

662
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,020
Difficult.

663
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:32,640
Let's go another way.
Follow me, boys.

664
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:36,480
This doesn't make any sense.

665
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,570
I give them a map.

666
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:40,650
I give them the girl.

667
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:42,820
What more do they want?

668
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,910
Can't I just lead them to the door?

669
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:47,660
Lmpossible, sir.
The way the game's A.I. Works is--

670
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:48,910
I know. I know.

671
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:50,830
Can I just talk to myself at least?

672
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:53,660
You are talking to yourself.
I am you.

673
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:57,540
Well, then, you, me, shut up.

674
00:51:57,630 --> 00:51:59,050
So be it.

675
00:51:59,130 --> 00:52:00,340
Am I insane?

676
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:02,090
Completely.

677
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,720
They're going the wrong way.

678
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,770
I have to drive them to level five.

679
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:20,530
Send in the Tinker Toys.

680
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,150
Finding another path.
Now, this is good thinking.

681
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,570
She's good.
We should listen to her more often.

682
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:31,200
- Stay off my side.
- OK.

683
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:39,090
What is this?

684
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:52,350
Tinker Toys!

685
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:59,400
Wait! What's worse, lava or Tinker Toys?

686
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:02,150
Definitely Tinker Toys.

687
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:04,240
Carmen, what do we do?

688
00:53:52,450 --> 00:53:55,620
Rip that wave, Juni.

689
00:53:56,830 --> 00:53:58,790
What are they doing?

690
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:00,960
They're straying from the path.

691
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,590
The Toymaker must be
pushing them towards his lair.

692
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:06,670
But why?
What could he gain from...

693
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:10,640
Check if there's a connection between
the grandfather and the Toymaker.

694
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,010
Hurry, people!

695
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:15,560
It's coming on-screen.

696
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:17,810
Comrades turned enemies.

697
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:22,190
Grandpa's gonna break the Toymaker
out of the game.

698
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:23,730
Stop them.

699
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:26,480
Stir the lava. Bigger waves.

700
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:28,150
Lava monsters. Anything.

701
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,030
We have to create obstacles for them.

702
00:54:30,110 --> 00:54:31,160
Come on!

703
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,990
We have to drown them.

704
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:37,410
They'll get a game over
and be evacuated from the game.

705
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,580
We can't risk letting the Toymaker out.

706
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:44,170
Do it.

707
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,720
This is new.

708
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,230
Juni!

709
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:04,730
Carmen!

710
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:09,530
Francis!

711
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:12,410
Arnold!

712
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:17,990
Grandpa!

713
00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:20,830
Me.

714
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:25,460
Where are they?

715
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:26,670
They fell in.

716
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:30,630
I know, but they should have
gotten a game over.

717
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,550
They should be back here, actually.

718
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:34,140
Hmm.

719
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,140
Huh?

720
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:46,270
The lava. It's cold.

721
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:52,110
This way. Juni. This way.
We found a door to the next level.

722
00:55:52,990 --> 00:55:54,450
Come on.

723
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:58,990
I thought I was a goner.

724
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:03,250
I saw all my points
flashing away before my eyes.

725
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:06,420
All I could hear was
my father saying, "You blew it, Arnold."

726
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:09,170
"No untold riches for you."

727
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:11,920
Uhh!

728
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:15,930
Where's Grandpa?

729
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:18,010
I don't know. But he was here.

730
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:20,470
Isn't this a piece of his armor?

731
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:27,690
Carmen, it's a passage.
Help me open it.

732
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:29,110
Red flag, Rez.

733
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:32,740
We have to talk about the Guy.
Highly sensitive.

734
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:34,320
What about him?

735
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,700
I've been rereading my tech manual.

736
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:39,330
It speaks of a deceiver within the game,

737
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:42,370
who will mislead you down a path
where no one will survive.

738
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:44,830
I think Juni's the deceiver.

739
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:47,960
What do you suggest?

740
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:52,090
We'll have to get rid of him
or risk losing the game.

741
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:55,550
What about his sister?

742
00:56:55,630 --> 00:56:57,300
Her too.

743
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,350
- How much time do we have left?
- Five minutes.

744
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:05,980
What happens in five minutes?

745
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:08,730
This place gets flooded
with players from around the world.

746
00:57:08,810 --> 00:57:10,980
Oh, great. Competition.

747
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:13,030
The Toymaker will take over their minds.

748
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:14,740
That's why we have to
shut down the game.

749
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:17,910
- Sh, Carmen!
- What is she talking about?

750
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:21,030
You didn't tell them yet, did you?

751
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:22,580
I was getting around to it.

752
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:24,700
Deceivers.

753
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:26,910
What about the other side of level five?

754
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,290
There is no other side.
You'll be imprisoned in the game.

755
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:31,460
Game over.

756
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:33,670
We're not letting you shut down this game.

757
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:36,920
You're gonna see how fast
that counter can count backwards.

758
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:40,430
You have to go through me first, game boy.

759
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:43,260
Now, listen to me.
I'm the Guy.

760
00:57:43,350 --> 00:57:45,100
Stop saying you're the Guy.

761
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:47,440
We all know that you're not the Guy.

762
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,350
He's not the Guy.

763
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:55,900
I am.

764
00:57:58,990 --> 00:58:00,490
And you are?

765
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:03,530
I'm the Guy.

766
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:05,290
The real Guy.

767
00:58:05,370 --> 00:58:06,500
And I say we go in,

768
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:09,330
beat this unwinnable level,
and get to the other side,

769
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:13,170
where untold riches
and a bounty fit for 10 kings awaits us.

770
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:14,380
I knew it.

771
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:16,840
Now, he's definitely the Guy.

772
00:58:17,470 --> 00:58:20,180
But it's unwinnable.

773
00:58:25,310 --> 00:58:27,310
Nothing is unwinnable

774
00:58:27,390 --> 00:58:29,850
if we join together and battle as one.

775
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:31,940
We play on each other's strengths

776
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:34,150
and help cover each other's weaknesses.

777
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:35,610
We can accomplish anything.

778
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:38,400
And we will accomplish everything.

779
00:58:38,490 --> 00:58:43,450
But first let's go whip this unwinnable level

780
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:44,950
and show it who's boss.

781
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:46,040
Are you with me?

782
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:47,580
Yeah!

783
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:50,460
Stand aside.

784
00:59:04,850 --> 00:59:06,390
Cake.

785
00:59:17,570 --> 00:59:18,780
Oh!

786
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:20,360
Oh, my.

787
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:25,030
Oops.

788
00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:28,870
Guy!

789
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,170
OK. You're the Guy again.

790
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:33,920
Get us through this, Juni.

791
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,460
But I...

792
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,260
Demetra!

793
00:59:47,970 --> 00:59:49,140
Juni, quickly!

794
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:51,100
I found the switch to shut down the game.

795
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:52,690
I also found the exit portal.

796
00:59:52,770 --> 00:59:54,690
We can all get out of here right now.

797
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:56,900
How did you survive?

798
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:59,480
There was a glitch in the game.
I don't know.

799
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:01,150
Juni, who is this?

800
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:03,860
This is Demetra, my girlf...

801
01:00:03,950 --> 01:00:06,320
My friend.
No, she's my--

802
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:09,240
I'm his girlfriend.
Who are you?

803
01:00:09,330 --> 01:00:11,330
I'm his sister.

804
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:14,500
She gave me the map.
The map that got us here.

805
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:16,540
Juni, she's not real.

806
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:19,000
What are you talking about?

807
01:00:19,090 --> 01:00:21,050
I've been helping Juni win the game.

808
01:00:21,090 --> 01:00:22,420
What have you been doing?

809
01:00:22,510 --> 01:00:24,180
Playing prisoner. That's what.

810
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:27,600
She set you up, Juni.
She set us all up.

811
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:30,060
I... Juni, she's lying.

812
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:31,720
She's been the Toymaker's prisoner.

813
01:00:31,810 --> 01:00:34,600
She could be brainwashed, for all we know.

814
01:00:34,690 --> 01:00:37,400
Do you want to win this game or not?

815
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:45,110
She's the reason this level's unwinnable.

816
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,070
She's the deceiver.

817
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:49,280
Why?

818
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:50,790
I'm sorry, Juni.

819
01:00:50,870 --> 01:00:54,210
But it's in my programming.

820
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:03,210
Congratulations!

821
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:07,300
You've made it to the end
of the game! You won!

822
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:10,100
Untold riches for all of you!

823
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:14,980
And your prize
is you get to stay... here.

824
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:18,230
Welcome to the game.

825
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:25,570
Juni, this way.

826
01:01:25,610 --> 01:01:26,820
This is the way out.

827
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:28,910
All of you, quickly!

828
01:01:32,910 --> 01:01:35,000
Wait!
We have to shut down the game.

829
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:37,210
I already did.
The switch is right there.

830
01:01:37,290 --> 01:01:38,500
- Are you sure?
- Yes, yes.

831
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:41,420
Go. Quickly, quickly.

832
01:01:49,470 --> 01:01:51,180
Run, Grandpa!

833
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:53,470
Go. I'll hold it open.

834
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:54,600
Go now!

835
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:57,100
Demetra.

836
01:01:57,190 --> 01:02:00,230
I can't hold it open forever, Juni.

837
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:07,900
We made it.

838
01:02:08,910 --> 01:02:12,950
Here's our e-mail addresses.
Just in case.

839
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:14,790
Terrific.

840
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:17,410
You're awesome, Grandpa.

841
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:20,460
The way you took on those Tinker Toys.

842
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:23,500
You're the coolest.

843
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:29,220
Thanks for everything, Guy.

844
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:32,300
It was real. Sort of.

845
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:35,810
Thanks a lot, Guy.

846
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,530
What's wrong?

847
01:02:49,610 --> 01:02:51,910
You don't want to leave, do you?

848
01:02:51,990 --> 01:02:53,830
How can I go back, Juni?

849
01:02:54,410 --> 01:02:59,370
In here, I can walk.
I can run.

850
01:02:59,410 --> 01:03:03,670
And you look at me
like I'm some kind of superhero.

851
01:03:03,710 --> 01:03:05,210
You are.

852
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:08,510
Out there in the real world, to me.

853
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:09,880
You are.

854
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,840
All right, Juni.

855
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:14,350
I shall go back if...

856
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:19,100
if you promise me that even
though I'll be in a wheelchair,

857
01:03:20,350 --> 01:03:24,610
that you will look at me
no differently than you are now.

858
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:31,610
Because on the inside, Juni,
on the inside, I feel like this.

859
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:35,740
I promise, Grandpa.

860
01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:40,120
Time to go.

861
01:03:46,790 --> 01:03:49,460
Coming through.
Coming through, please.

862
01:03:49,510 --> 01:03:52,340
Those video games
are killers on the eyes, huh, kid?

863
01:03:52,430 --> 01:03:54,390
Agent Cortez, we'll take it from here.

864
01:03:54,470 --> 01:03:56,680
My grandson will handle this.

865
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:00,140
Don't touch.
This is Corinthian leather.

866
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:06,900
OK.

867
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:10,570
So tell me again
how you shut off the game.

868
01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:12,650
I don't know if we shut it down, exactly.

869
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:14,490
We hit a switch, and it seemed to work.

870
01:04:14,570 --> 01:04:16,570
Oh, it worked.
The game's down.

871
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:19,580
We just need to make sure
we did this correctly.

872
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:22,620
Actually, Grandpa hit the switch.

873
01:04:22,710 --> 01:04:25,630
Cortez, are these the boys
that were in the game with you?

874
01:04:25,710 --> 01:04:27,840
We tracked them
through their e-mail addresses.

875
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:31,420
Yeah, that's them.
They wouldn't know anything about...

876
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:32,840
Hey, wait a second.

877
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:35,260
What happened to Francis the Brain,

878
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:37,350
Arnold the Strong, and Mr. Cool?

879
01:04:37,430 --> 01:04:40,680
Well, in the real world, I'm not that smart.

880
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,730
I'm not strong.

881
01:04:42,810 --> 01:04:44,350
I'm not cool.

882
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:46,900
Reality check.

883
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:49,270
So who are you out here in the real world?

884
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:52,320
Special Agent Cortez, we need you.

885
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:54,240
Whoa.

886
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:58,070
I'm just Juni Cortez.

887
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:02,330
Let's have it, Grandpa.
What switch did you hit exactly?

888
01:05:02,410 --> 01:05:04,410
There were two switches side by side.

889
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,290
One switch shuts down the game.

890
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:08,380
But the other releases the Toymaker.

891
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:10,550
Who was the idiot who designed that?

892
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:15,800
Did you free the Toymaker by accident?

893
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:18,930
Oh, I freed the Toymaker.
But it was no accident.

894
01:05:19,010 --> 01:05:21,350
Do you want to stop the game?

895
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:24,730
Then you must defeat the Toymaker.
It's the only way.

896
01:05:24,770 --> 01:05:26,100
You crazy old man!

897
01:05:26,190 --> 01:05:28,150
Do you know what you've done?

898
01:05:29,150 --> 01:05:31,360
Grandpa, revenge doesn't solve anything.

899
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:34,900
Will you trust me?
You of all people?

900
01:05:35,610 --> 01:05:36,990
A message from the president.

901
01:05:37,070 --> 01:05:38,870
Oh, what does he want?

902
01:05:39,410 --> 01:05:43,870
I'm coming back to settle the score.

903
01:05:43,950 --> 01:05:46,160
For imprisoning me.

904
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:47,960
For using me.

905
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:49,580
Devlin set us up?

906
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:51,170
It's not Devlin.

907
01:05:51,790 --> 01:05:55,840
All I wanted to do was right the wrongs.

908
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,590
Start over a new world.

909
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:59,800
A new chance.

910
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:03,810
Where everyone would get
a second chance!

911
01:06:04,770 --> 01:06:06,430
But no.

912
01:06:07,890 --> 01:06:12,440
So now I'm taking this
to the next level!

913
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:16,940
Seismic activity off the map!

914
01:06:18,650 --> 01:06:19,660
Earthquake!

915
01:06:19,740 --> 01:06:21,160
Tornado!

916
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:22,200
Hurricane!

917
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:24,740
Carmen, let's go!

918
01:06:24,830 --> 01:06:26,660
Everybody, relax!

919
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:46,390
Quick! Put your glasses on.

920
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:49,560
It's the only way you can see
what's really happening.

921
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:52,480
The game has entered the real world.

922
01:06:55,690 --> 01:06:58,650
There's only one thing to do
in a situation like this.

923
01:06:58,690 --> 01:06:59,610
What?

924
01:07:00,110 --> 01:07:03,320
Call in the family.
Calling all Cortezes.

925
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:08,580
This is it. This is it.

926
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:10,160
This is it.

927
01:07:10,210 --> 01:07:12,790
The moment we've been waiting for.

928
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,340
Yes.

929
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:16,960
Nobody move. Nobody move!

930
01:07:17,050 --> 01:07:19,720
Nobody touch the brain.
The fifth brain.

931
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,850
This is a historic moment.

932
01:07:24,890 --> 01:07:27,390
Probably the...

933
01:07:30,730 --> 01:07:33,980
Probably the most important...

934
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:35,190
No.

935
01:07:36,190 --> 01:07:39,740
This is the most important
moment of my life.

936
01:07:41,150 --> 01:07:43,360
No one can disturb me now.

937
01:07:43,450 --> 01:07:46,830
I must activate the brain.

938
01:07:48,450 --> 01:07:49,450
Now.

939
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:50,790
- Mr. Cortez?
- Eh?

940
01:07:50,870 --> 01:07:54,630
Your children called.
Some sort of emergency.

941
01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:08,930
Well, I'm their uncle.

942
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:18,150
Dad, you need these to see.

943
01:08:18,230 --> 01:08:19,440
Glasses, quick!

944
01:08:29,490 --> 01:08:31,330
Incoming.

945
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:51,850
This won't be easy.

946
01:08:57,310 --> 01:08:59,400
Let's kick some metal.

947
01:09:08,490 --> 01:09:10,910
What about all the other ones?

948
01:09:14,710 --> 01:09:17,250
We need more help.
Our family isn't big enough.

949
01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:20,550
Remember one thing.
Everyone's your family.

950
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:27,220
Calling... everyone.

951
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:32,850
We're here to save the day.

952
01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:35,350
Floop and Minion!

953
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:42,440
Robot children!

954
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:45,570
Take 'em down!

955
01:09:47,530 --> 01:09:49,950
Dinky Winks!

956
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:56,620
Somebody ring the Dinkster?

957
01:10:00,380 --> 01:10:01,750
Whoa!

958
01:10:02,670 --> 01:10:06,550
You're gonna make a nice addition
to my theme park.

959
01:10:08,130 --> 01:10:11,680
Game over for you, pal.
Game over!

960
01:10:17,730 --> 01:10:19,650
Somebody call in a loon?

961
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:23,070
Sorry, Romero,
this is the only pair we had left.

962
01:10:23,150 --> 01:10:25,280
They're a little broken.

963
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:27,400
They're perfect.

964
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:30,490
Charge, Sporky!

965
01:10:31,530 --> 01:10:32,990
Brand him, Daddy.

966
01:10:33,530 --> 01:10:35,620
Thanks, Little Dink.

967
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,630
- Unh!
- Unh!

968
01:10:50,930 --> 01:10:51,970
Gary Giggles?

969
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:54,720
- Yeah?
- Carmen Cortez.

970
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:56,180
I need your help right away.

971
01:10:56,270 --> 01:10:57,890
I'm there.

972
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:02,190
I'm here.

973
01:11:02,270 --> 01:11:03,900
Give me a hand.

974
01:11:04,690 --> 01:11:05,690
Whoa.

975
01:11:09,570 --> 01:11:11,570
- Unh!
- Thanks.

976
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:17,370
- Hey.
- Hey.

977
01:11:18,910 --> 01:11:19,870
Thank you, Gerti.

978
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,630
There's still one more.

979
01:11:37,970 --> 01:11:39,810
That's impossible.

980
01:11:39,890 --> 01:11:41,810
Someone has to go up there.

981
01:11:41,890 --> 01:11:43,810
And shut it down manually.

982
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:46,150
It's the only way.

983
01:11:46,230 --> 01:11:48,440
But who?

984
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:50,780
I'm ready.

985
01:11:50,860 --> 01:11:53,360
It must be done.

986
01:11:54,820 --> 01:11:56,280
Grandpa, no!

987
01:11:56,330 --> 01:11:59,200
Let him go.
Your grandfather has to do this.

988
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:12,840
Thank you for freeing me,
Valentin, but it's too late.

989
01:12:12,930 --> 01:12:15,680
Nothing can stop me. Not even you.

990
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:19,430
That's true. Only you can do that.

991
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:22,100
You double-crossed us.

992
01:12:22,190 --> 01:12:25,480
The agency, your fellow agents, and me.

993
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:28,570
Your mistake cost me my legs.

994
01:12:29,110 --> 01:12:30,230
Well, a mistake like that

995
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:33,200
could only push someone
further into the dark.

996
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:34,990
And it has.

997
01:12:35,070 --> 01:12:36,530
Look at you now.

998
01:12:36,570 --> 01:12:38,530
I gave you back your legs in the game.

999
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:40,540
I did that for you.

1000
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:46,040
Let me tell you all the things
I've missed in my life

1001
01:12:46,130 --> 01:12:49,340
because of the accident you caused.

1002
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:52,760
I can't walk on the beach with my wife.

1003
01:12:53,630 --> 01:12:56,840
I missed my daughter's birth.

1004
01:12:57,390 --> 01:12:59,010
And wedding.

1005
01:13:00,260 --> 01:13:01,810
Shall I continue?

1006
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:07,400
Grandpa.

1007
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,070
Don't.

1008
01:13:09,150 --> 01:13:13,530
Now let me tell you
all the good things that came of it.

1009
01:13:14,450 --> 01:13:16,030
Humility.

1010
01:13:16,070 --> 01:13:17,950
Spirituality.

1011
01:13:18,030 --> 01:13:19,330
Understanding.

1012
01:13:19,410 --> 01:13:23,080
You've been living in fear of me
all these years.

1013
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:25,710
But I've only been searching for you

1014
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:30,210
so I could tell you that I forgive you.

1015
01:13:34,590 --> 01:13:39,050
I've only dreamed I would hear
you say something like that.

1016
01:13:39,140 --> 01:13:43,390
Now the question is,
can you forgive yourself?

1017
01:13:43,430 --> 01:13:46,730
It's never too late, Sebastian.

1018
01:13:46,810 --> 01:13:50,020
Take your time.
Take your time to decide.

1019
01:13:50,110 --> 01:13:53,190
We have about 10 seconds.

1020
01:13:57,860 --> 01:13:59,530
Game...

1021
01:14:00,830 --> 01:14:02,080
over.

1022
01:14:05,330 --> 01:14:08,540
Juni, get out of there!

1023
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:30,190
Grandpa!

1024
01:14:43,370 --> 01:14:45,160
So, wait a minute.

1025
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:48,460
Who won?

1026
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:52,540
It's not whether you win or lose.

1027
01:14:52,630 --> 01:14:56,090
It's how you play the game.

1028
01:14:57,420 --> 01:14:58,470
To family.

1029
01:14:59,010 --> 01:15:00,130
To family.

1030
01:15:00,220 --> 01:15:01,300
- To family.
- To family.

1031
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:03,640
- To family.
- To family.

1032
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:05,970
- To family.
- To family.

1033
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:07,060
To family.

1034
01:15:07,310 --> 01:15:08,480
To family.

1035
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:09,600
- To family.
- To family.

1036
01:15:09,690 --> 01:15:10,730
To family.

1037
01:15:10,810 --> 01:15:12,650
- Family.
- Familia.

1038
01:15:12,690 --> 01:15:15,480
- To family.
- To family.

1039
01:15:15,690 --> 01:15:17,190
To family.

1040
01:15:21,030 --> 01:15:23,320
And break!

1041
01:15:58,750 --> 01:16:01,390
â™ª The time has come â™ª

1042
01:16:01,470 --> 01:16:03,550
â™ª Once and for all â™ª

1043
01:16:04,230 --> 01:16:07,030
â™ª You met your match â™ª

1044
01:16:07,070 --> 01:16:08,630
â™ª You will fall â™ª

1045
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:11,470
â™ª This little game we play
is gonna break us down â™ª

1046
01:16:11,550 --> 01:16:14,150
â™ª Only one of us can wear the crown â™ª

1047
01:16:14,230 --> 01:16:16,910
â™ª It's not as easy as you thought it'd be â™ª

1048
01:16:16,990 --> 01:16:19,510
â™ª When it's down to you versus me â™ª

1049
01:16:20,670 --> 01:16:22,430
â™ª I play rough â™ª

1050
01:16:22,510 --> 01:16:25,430
â™ª I don 't need to try â™ª

1051
01:16:25,510 --> 01:16:27,470
â™ª You like to play mean â™ª

1052
01:16:27,550 --> 01:16:30,150
â™ª But the score never lies â™ª

1053
01:16:30,750 --> 01:16:31,330
â™ª Game over â™ª

1054
01:16:32,230 --> 01:16:33,990
â™ª Game over â™ª

1055
01:16:34,830 --> 01:16:36,230
â™ª For now â™ª

1056
01:16:38,190 --> 01:16:40,560
- Like Valentin.
- Like Valentin.

1057
01:16:40,710 --> 01:16:43,910
Val. More like that? Valentin.

1058
01:16:43,990 --> 01:16:47,030
Hey, how you doin', Valentin?

1059
01:16:47,110 --> 01:16:48,030
Hey, I know.

1060
01:16:48,110 --> 01:16:50,710
All right. Here we go.
Settle, please.

1061
01:16:50,750 --> 01:16:54,710
Yo, Valentin!
What are you doin' in space?

1062
01:16:55,670 --> 01:16:56,830
You...

1063
01:17:07,350 --> 01:17:08,470
Take 'em down!

1064
01:17:09,910 --> 01:17:12,310
OK. Fists. Good.

1065
01:17:12,390 --> 01:17:14,390
What else is new?

1066
01:17:14,470 --> 01:17:15,550
This is different.

1067
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:17,270
Once you get through the game,

1068
01:17:17,310 --> 01:17:19,310
your mind belongs to the Toymaker.

1069
01:17:19,390 --> 01:17:21,390
Aah!
Let's do it again right away.

1070
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:25,550
I'm coming back to settle the score.

1071
01:17:26,910 --> 01:17:29,630
For imprisoning me.

1072
01:17:29,710 --> 01:17:32,390
For using me.

1073
01:17:36,990 --> 01:17:39,870
That might be the end
of my career right there.

1074
01:17:42,410 --> 01:17:44,250
â™ª Game over â™ª

1075
01:17:45,090 --> 01:17:46,970
â™ª Game over â™ª

1076
01:17:47,730 --> 01:17:49,570
â™ª Game over â™ª

1077
01:17:50,410 --> 01:17:52,290
â™ª For now â™ª

1078
01:17:53,050 --> 01:17:55,730
â™ª Winning the game's â™ª

1079
01:17:55,810 --> 01:17:57,730
â™ª The only rule allowed â™ª

1080
01:17:58,450 --> 01:18:00,890
â™ª No more good luck â™ª

1081
01:18:00,930 --> 01:18:03,010
â™ª Or cheers from the crowd â™ª

1082
01:18:03,090 --> 01:18:05,650
â™ª When the game began
you never thought you'd lose â™ª

1083
01:18:05,730 --> 01:18:06,930
â™ª But your time is up â™ª

1084
01:18:07,010 --> 01:18:08,490
â™ª I play to bruise â™ª

1085
01:18:08,570 --> 01:18:11,170
â™ª Look around, in fact,
you've lost your team â™ª

1086
01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:14,210
â™ª You tried your best,
but you ran out of steam â™ª

1087
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:17,130
â™ª I play rough â™ª

1088
01:18:17,170 --> 01:18:19,810
â™ª I don 't need to try â™ª

1089
01:18:19,890 --> 01:18:21,810
â™ª You like to piay mean â™ª

1090
01:18:21,890 --> 01:18:24,090
â™ª But the score never lies â™ª

1091
01:18:24,170 --> 01:18:26,170
â™ª You're all out of wishes â™ª

1092
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:27,890
â™ª Kiss your dreams goodbye â™ª

1093
01:18:27,970 --> 01:18:29,610
â™ª The end's the same â™ª

1094
01:18:29,650 --> 01:18:32,010
â™ª It's not whether you win or lose â™ª

1095
01:18:32,090 --> 01:18:34,930
â™ª It's how you piay the game â™ª

1096
01:18:35,890 --> 01:18:37,690
â™ª Game over â™ª

â™ª Is that all you got? â™ª

1101
01:19:21,970 --> 01:19:23,290
â™ª Come on â™ª

1102
01:19:24,570 --> 01:19:26,370
â™ª Unh-Unh â™ª

1103
01:19:26,450 --> 01:19:27,810
â™ª Bring it on â™ª

â™ª Game over â™ª

1109
01:20:02,730 --> 01:20:05,970
â™ª I'm trying to figure out
the rules, I don 't lose â™ª

1110
01:20:06,050 --> 01:20:08,610
â™ª I'm tested, I've already seen
some bad dudes â™ª

1111
01:20:08,650 --> 01:20:11,690
â™ª Do what's in your nature,
don 't let 'em break you â™ª

1112
01:20:11,770 --> 01:20:14,490
â™ª Plan to win if they're
raising the stakes up â™ª

1113
01:20:14,570 --> 01:20:17,010
â™ª Now, you can take
a few bumps and bruises â™ª

1114
01:20:17,090 --> 01:20:19,610
â™ª I'm confident, I'm telling you,
you will not lose this â™ª

1115
01:20:19,690 --> 01:20:22,530
â™ª Life foe is dwindling,
you're bareiy alive â™ª

1116
01:20:22,570 --> 01:20:25,930
â™ª Time to let go of the wheel
and let your heart drive â™ª

1117
01:20:25,970 --> 01:20:29,250
â™ª Just let your heart drive â™ª

1118
01:20:29,330 --> 01:20:31,530
â™ª Just let your heart drive â™ª

1119
01:20:32,690 --> 01:20:34,730
â™ª Come on, come on â™ª

1120
01:20:37,050 --> 01:20:40,330
â™ª Just let your heart drive â™ª

1121
01:20:40,410 --> 01:20:43,090
â™ª Just let your heart drive â™ª

1122
01:21:02,130 --> 01:21:04,690
â™ª That's right, that's right â™ª

1123
01:21:04,770 --> 01:21:07,970
â™ª Just let your heart drive â™ª

1124
01:21:08,010 --> 01:21:10,210
â™ª Just let your heart drive â™ª

1125
01:21:11,250 --> 01:21:13,610
â™ª Come on, come on â™ª

1126
01:21:15,850 --> 01:21:19,050
â™ª Just let your heart drive â™ª

1127
01:21:19,090 --> 01:21:21,730
â™ª Just let your heart drive â™ª

1128
01:21:30,210 --> 01:21:32,930
â™ª Let your heart drive â™ª

1129
01:21:51,430 --> 01:21:53,150
Dad, he's imitating me.

1130
01:21:53,190 --> 01:21:56,190
- Do that again.
- Dad, he's imitating me.

1131
01:21:56,270 --> 01:21:58,190
He sounds just like you, honey.

1132
01:21:58,230 --> 01:22:00,390
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

1133
01:22:00,470 --> 01:22:01,750
That's better.
Thank you, dear.

1134
01:22:01,910 --> 01:22:04,670
That's better.
Thank you, dear.

1135
01:22:06,950 --> 01:22:08,070
How long have you known?

1136
01:22:08,150 --> 01:22:09,270
Since forever.

1137
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:11,070
Mom made me swear not to mention it.

1138
01:22:11,110 --> 01:22:12,790
So why are you mentioning it?

1139
01:22:12,870 --> 01:22:16,630
'Cause she also told me
never to swear, so now we're even.

1140
01:22:16,710 --> 01:22:19,310
How's that for even?
You're on your own.

1141
01:22:19,350 --> 01:22:21,230
Hey, wait!
I warned you!
