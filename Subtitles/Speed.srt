2
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Hey, this area's restricted.

3
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,600
Oh, hi. Yeah, I know.
They called me down here.

4
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,700
Some of this wiring
got screwed up.

5
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,700
Nobody called it down to me.
I'm gonna have to see a work order.

6
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,700
Yeah. Just a second.

7
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,900
There you are.

8
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,200
Nothing personal.

9
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,100
<i>- I guess that wraps
it up. Good work, everybody. </i>

10
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,600
Marty, I couldn't be happier with the way this worked out.

11
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,300
- Congratulations.
- Good for you.

12
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,200
Oh, hold that.

13
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,600
Whoa.

14
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,000
Gee, thanks.

15
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,200
Thanks for pushing that, Bob.
The light's on.

16
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,000
- But you never know. It really might be broken.
- Shut up.

17
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,110
So remember, honey...

18
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:39,810
<i>- No! Please!</i>

19
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:56,210
Jesus. Bob,
what button did you push?

20
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,920
<i>Peter! Come on!</i>

21
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:47,120
<i>Mr. Bagwell, make sure these other
elevators remain locked down and empty. </i>

22
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,520
- Yes, sir.
- Now, there's no other way, no doors...

23
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,820
no other way in or out
except through access panels.

24
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,820
- Is that correct?
- Yes, sir.

25
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:58,420
What we have here are 13 passengers
in an express elevator below floor 30.

26
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:03,220
Bomb's already taken out cables. Bomber wants
$3 million, or he blows the emergency brakes.

27
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,720
<i>- What's our clock?
- He gave one hour. </i>

28
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:11,420
- That leaves 23 minutes exactly.
- Anything else that'll keep this elevator from falling?

29
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,520
- The basement.
- The city would like to avoid that event, Officer Traven.

30
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,520
<i>- We can't just unload the passengers?
- This is an express elevator. </i>

31
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,820
The only way in or out
is through access panels.

32
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,320
The bomber's also wired
the hatch to trigger the bomb,

33
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,120
<i>which seats him in the crazy
but not stupid section. </i>

34
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,720
Sir, Harry volunteers
to examine the device.

35
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,730
Yeah, right.

36
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,530
<i>Fine. The two of you
check it out. </i>

37
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:36,730
<i> The nearest access
panel's on the 32nd floor in the lobby. </i>

38
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,730
<i>I want reports only.
We're in a holding pattern. </i>

39
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,730
Worthy and Briggs, I want you to secure
the base area. No one in or out.

40
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,430
Everyone else, I want you
to affirm building evac. Move!

41
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:47,430
Looks like we're walkin'.

42
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:51,030
<i>Hurry, folks, but watch your step.
- Twenty-nine!</i>

43
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:54,030
All the way down to the lobby!
Let's go, folks!

44
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:57,530
Thirty!

45
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,330
Thirty-one!

46
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,530
Thirty-two.

47
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,230
<i>- Hello?
- What's going on?</i>

48
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,230
<i>- Come on, man. Get us out of here!
- Hello?</i>

49
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,930
<i>- What's that?
- Hello!</i>

50
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:37,730
<i>Please help us!</i>

51
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:08,440
<i> Help! Please!
Get us out of here!</i>

52
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,640
<i>Please!</i>

53
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,040
<i>Please, get us out of here!</i>

54
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,040
<i>Who's up there?</i>

55
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,840
<i>Who's up there?
What's going on?</i>

56
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:46,040
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the L.A.P.D.

57
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,140
- Thank God!
- What are you doing up there?

58
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,650
<i> There has been an elevator
malfunction, so just relax. </i>

59
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:56,650
<i> Hey, come on!
What are you guys waiting for?</i>

60
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,050
We'll have you out of there
as soon as possible.

61
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,050
Am I lying?

62
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,350
How come they sent
cops here?

63
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,750
Shouldn't they send
repair guys?

64
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:09,850
<i>- Yeah.
- Doesn't make any sense. </i>

65
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,350
What do you think?

66
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,050
- You're the expert. I just work here.
- Looks pretty solid.

67
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:26,850
<i>- Anyone we know?
- I don't recognize the work, but he's a pro. </i>

68
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,250
Oh, he's cuttin' it close.

69
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,250
I don't like it.

70
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,250
<i>Yeah, well, what's to like?
Mac said we hold, so we hold. </i>

71
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:47,050
<i>All right, pop quiz.
The airport. </i>

72
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,550
Gunman with one hostage.
He's usin' her for cover.

73
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:54,250
He's almost to a plane.
You're a hundred feet away.

74
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,850
Jack.

75
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,860
Shoot the hostage.

76
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,860
What?

77
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,960
Take her
out of the equation.

78
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:11,260
Go for the good wound, and
he can't get to the plane with her.

79
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,060
<i>- Clear shot.
- You're deeply nuts. You know that?</i>

80
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,060
<i>"Shoot the hostage. "
Geez. </i>

81
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,660
Harry, this is wrong.
He's gonna blow it anyway.

82
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,660
<i>Why?</i>

83
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,860
I don't know.
Gut feeling.

84
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,160
Well, right now Mac
outranks your gut, so we sit.

85
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,760
This is taking way too long.

86
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,960
How much you think
that elevator weighs?

87
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,360
<i>Jack, come on. </i>

88
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,560
Maybe we can do something
about those hostages.

89
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,560
We're not gonna
shoot 'em, right?

90
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,260
<i> Hey, where are you going?
What's going on?</i>

91
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,860
<i>Don't go! Don't leave us here!</i>

92
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,970
No, we just take them
out of the equation.

93
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:52,270
- You sure it'll hold?
- It'll hold.

94
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,670
Six minutes.

95
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:58,770
I can't get any more time.
He's not talkin'!

96
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,470
I need
the goddamn money now!

97
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:14,670
Tell me again, Harry.
Why did I take this job?

98
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:19,170
Aw, come on. Thirty more years of this, you
get a tiny pension and a cheap gold watch.

99
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:22,570
Cool. Whoa!

100
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,380
<i>- God, it's hot in here.
- There's no air. </i>

101
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,680
<i>- Can't they just pry the doors open?
- I can't breathe. </i>

102
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,380
Don't fuck with Daddy.

103
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:22,380
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

104
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,980
Oh, my God!

105
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:39,790
- Oh, my God! What's happening?
- Grab her hand!

106
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:43,690
Usually they fall down now.

107
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,890
Get her up!

108
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:55,390
He's early.
The son of a bitch is early.

109
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:17,890
Mac, we need
more help up here now!

110
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:22,890
- Oh, please open the door!
- I don't wanna die! Please!

111
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,190
<i>- Save me! I wanna get out!
- Open the door!</i>

112
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:39,290
- Please help me!
- Joan, get back! We'll get you out!

113
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,490
Give me your hands!

114
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:44,490
- It's okay. Give me your hands.
- Pull me through!

115
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,400
- Oh, God!
- Watch your head. Watch your head.

116
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,200
- Help me!
- Okay, I've got you. I've got you.

117
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,300
- Take it easy!
- You're fine.

118
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,200
- Oh, thank you!
- You're fine.

119
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,900
- Take her. Okay, let's go! Next!
- Okay, lady, come on.

120
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,300
- Thank you. Oh.
- I've got you, ma'am.

121
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,800
Just move back, please.

122
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:18,300
What the hell is all this?

123
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,300
Help us! Hurry!

124
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:26,100
<i>Hurry! Hurry! Let's go!
Go! Go! Let's go!</i>

125
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,400
<i>- Let's go! Let's go!
- Come on! Come on!</i>

126
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:35,500
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Come on.

127
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,900
- Help me out! Please help me out!
- Watch your head.

128
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,500
- Come on, lady! Come on!
- No.

129
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,200
Come on, lady! Come on!
Grab my hand! Come on!

130
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,800
<i>- Go! - There's one more.
Can you get her out?</i>

131
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,900
Come on.
Come on, let's go!

132
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,600
<i>- No. No, I can't!
- It's going to fall. </i>

133
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,700
Just take one step,
reach out and take my hand.

134
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,710
<i>- Come on!
- Hurry!</i>

135
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,210
<i>Come on!</i>

136
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:07,110
Oh, God! Don't let go of me!

137
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:10,310
You're okay.

138
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:25,510
- Great God!
- Oh, my shoe!

139
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:28,010
Let's go, let's go!

140
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,210
<i>Was it good for you?</i>

141
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:33,210
Oh, it was great for me.
How was it for you, honey?

142
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:36,410
- Elevator dropped.
- Oh, good. That's good to know.

143
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:45,510
- Is your watch slow?
- Uh-uh. No, no. He jumped the gun.

144
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:49,210
- We had three minutes left.
- Why does he do that?

145
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,310
He's losing
his three million.

146
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:53,910
I don't know. Maybe he
couldn't hold his wad long enough.

147
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:58,410
It's a common problem among
middle-aged men. So I'm told.

148
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,210
He's here.

149
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:08,110
He could've blown
that thing from Pacoima.

150
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:13,120
No. He knew we were up
to something. He's close by.

151
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,420
<i>He's not gonna corner
himself in a building. </i>

152
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,120
<i>We evacuated anyway.
Come on. </i>

153
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:29,420
All right. He'd want to be here,
but he'd want to stay mobile, right?

154
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,620
<i>The elevators. </i>

155
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,320
The passenger cars were stopped.
They checked them out.

156
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:40,520
What about
the freight elevators?

157
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,620
Will the mystery guest
please sign in?

158
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,720
What?

159
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,520
Jack. Damn it!

160
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,630
Get to the floor!

161
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:15,930
<i>Shit! Shit! Shit!</i>

162
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,530
Up! Get your ass up!

163
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:07,740
I don't suppose anybody'll give
me three million just for you.

164
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,640
Hold it!

165
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:20,540
<i>Pop quiz, hot shot.
Terrorist holding a police hostage. </i>

166
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,140
Got enough dynamite strapped
to his chest to blow a building in half.

167
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,140
Now, what do you do?

168
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,040
There's gonna be 50 cops
waiting for you in the basement.

169
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,940
Oh, standard flanking
deployment, right?

170
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,440
Well, maybe we'll get off
on the third floor, huh?

171
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,440
At least that's
what they'll think.

172
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,840
I want location
of those goddamn shots!

173
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,840
Briggs,
where's Jack and Harry?

174
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,750
Lieutenant, we've got movement
on the freight elevator.

175
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,650
It's on three.
Let's move!

176
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:03,850
End of the line. This day has been
real disappointing, I don't mind saying.

177
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:06,350
Why, because you didn't
get to kill everyone?

178
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,050
There will come a time, boy,
when you'll wish you'd never met me.

179
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,450
Mister, I'm already there.

180
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:15,250
But, you see, I'm in charge here.
I drop this stick, huh,

181
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,850
and they pick your friend up
with a sponge.

182
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:21,350
- Are you ready to die, friend?
- Fuck you.

183
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:24,250
Oh! In 200 years,
we've come from...

184
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:28,250
"I regret but I have one life to give
for my country" to "Fuck you"?

185
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:31,450
- Go ahead, drop the stick. Do it.
- Shut up, Harry.

186
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,750
Aw, we've got all the balls
in the world right here, man!

187
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:36,950
Give it up!
You got nowhere to go!

188
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:39,650
Shoot the hostage.

189
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:44,050
Say good-bye, Harry.

190
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,750
You fuck!

191
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:56,260
Freeze!

192
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,960
Freeze! Give it up!
You're out of options!

193
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:27,260
Through dedication and bravery,
these next two officers...

194
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,460
effected the rescue
of 13 citizens of this city.

195
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:36,060
Thanks to them, the only life taken
by the terrorist's bomb was his own.

196
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,060
You shot me.
I can't believe it.

197
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,360
They're giving you a medal
for shooting me, you little prick.

198
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:46,160
Harry, you told me to.

199
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:50,260
<i>The Medal of Valor is the highest honor for
a member of Los Angeles Police Department. </i>

200
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,560
<i>Officer Harry Temple. </i>

201
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,560
Congratulations.

202
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,070
Officer Jack Traven.

203
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:29,070
Way to go, Jack.
Way to go.

204
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:32,270
<i>- There we go. There we go.
- Harry, my man.</i>

205
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,370
Oh, beautiful.
A toast to me.

206
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:36,370
- Make me feel good about myself.
- There you go.

207
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:40,370
Hey, Sandy! Here we go!
Okay, so how we do...

208
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,470
<i>Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!</i>

209
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:44,570
I need a bib!

210
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:47,570
Here we go. All right.

211
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:50,470
- You can't take me anywhere.
- That's mine.

212
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:53,070
And here is to Harry.

213
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:56,270
<i>For his quick thinking,</i>

214
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,770
for his grace
under pressure...

215
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:01,470
and for his brave
and selfless act.

216
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:04,870
- Hear, hear!
- Hear, hear!

217
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:08,970
And to Jack...
for shooting Harry.

218
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:12,970
Something we've all wanted to do
for a very long time.

219
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:15,270
Hey, hey, hey!

220
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:17,870
Okay, no, no.
Here it is. Here it is.

221
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:22,480
Here's to you guys for doing
your job and for not getting dead.

222
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:25,380
- Mazel tov.
- Mazel tov.

223
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,680
I can't do that.

224
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,380
We are the two luckiest guys
in the world, you know that?

225
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:41,180
- We got the bad guy, and we didn't lose any civilians.
- Yeah, we're good.

226
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,180
- No, you were lucky.
- No, we were lucky.

227
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:48,980
You'd better understand it.
We were dealing with a total psycho.

228
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,180
This guy could've blown us up
at any time. Whew.

229
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,580
And I got a bullet in me.

230
00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:00,180
Six inches off the mark, and
they're giving the medal to my wife.

231
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,880
Harry, come on, man.
I mean, we won, we got him.

232
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:06,880
Do you listen?
Do you ever...

233
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:10,380
Because I am not gonna be
around to back you up,

234
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,880
so you'd better
start thinking.

235
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,680
Guts will get you so far,
and then they'll get you killed.

236
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,680
Luck runs out,
sooner or later.

237
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,180
<i>- Right, chief?
- That's right. </i>

238
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,880
- Ho!
- I'm all right. I'm all right.

239
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:32,990
I'm gonna go home,
have some sex.

240
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:36,290
Harry, you're gonna
go home and puke.

241
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:40,290
Yeah, well,
that'll be fun too.

242
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:43,090
Come on, you gimp.

243
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:08,390
Hey, Jack, I saw you on TV.
Congratulations.

244
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,490
- Thanks, Bob.
- Yeah, you looked fat.

245
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:13,490
Be easy on him, Bob. The boy
was up late last night partying.

246
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,990
- A wild party, huh?
- Yeah, well, I don't remember it that well.

247
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:19,590
Couldn't have been too great.
I woke up alone.

248
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:22,290
Yeah? Well, you know,
the last time I partied like that,

249
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,390
I woke up married,
huh, Vinnie?

250
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:27,190
Hey, Jack,
you forgot your muffins.

251
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:30,490
- Have a good one, Bob.
- Thanks, Jack. Take care, huh?

252
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:33,390
Thanks.

253
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,700
See you tomorrow.

254
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,000
<i>Call 9-1-1!</i>

255
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,410
What do you think, Jack?

256
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:08,110
You think if you pick up
all the bus driver's teeth,

257
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:10,610
they'll give you
another medal?

258
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:13,810
- Jesus!
- You think I wouldn't have been prepared?

259
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:17,910
Two years I spent
setting up that elevator job.

260
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:20,010
Two years I invested
myself in it.

261
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:23,810
You couldn't understand the kind
of commitment that I have.

262
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:27,510
You ruin a man's life's work,
and you think you can walk away.

263
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:29,710
You got blinders on
to the world.

264
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:32,610
But I got your attention now,
didn't I, Jack?

265
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:35,710
- Why didn't you just come after me?
- No, this is about me.

266
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:39,310
This is about my money.
This is about money due me.

267
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:43,710
Which I will collect.
$3.7 million.

268
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:47,910
It's my nest egg, Jack.
At my age, you gotta think ahead.

269
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:51,310
- When I find you...
- Pop quiz, hot shot.

270
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:53,510
There's a bomb on a bus.

271
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:58,210
Once the bus goes 50 miles
an hour, the bomb is armed.

272
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:02,510
If it drops below 50,
it blows up.

273
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:06,020
What do you do?
What do you do!

274
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,620
I'd wanna know
what bus it was.

275
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,920
You think I'm
gonna tell you that?

276
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,120
- Yes.
- Very good.

277
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:17,720
There are rules, Jack, and
I want you to get this right.

278
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:20,020
No one goes off the bus.

279
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:24,220
You try to take any passengers
off the bus, I will detonate it.

280
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,320
I want my money by 11:00 a. m.

281
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,620
- We can't pull that kind of money in time.
- Focus, Jack!

282
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,120
Your concern is the bus.
And don't try to call.

283
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,620
The radio's down.
Now, the number of the bus is 2525.

284
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,020
It's running downtown
from Venice.

285
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:49,120
It is at the corner
of Ocean Park and Main.

286
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:05,520
<i>Sam! Sam!</i>

287
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:08,320
- Annie.
- Sam!

288
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,920
Tell him to stop! Shit!
Excuse me! Comin' through.

289
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,920
Sam! God... Shit.

290
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,230
Whoa! Stop!

291
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:18,930
- This ain't no bus stop.
- Oh, Sam!

292
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:22,230
<i>- Get rid of your butt, Annie.
- Okay, it's gone, it's gone.</i>

293
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:25,030
You are a good, kind man.

294
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:27,630
One day people will write
songs about you.

295
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,130
- Hi.
- Hi.

296
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:49,730
First time in L.A.

297
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:52,930
- Oh, no, I live here.
- No, I mean mine.

298
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:56,130
<i>Oh, that's just funny.
You heard me wrong. </i>

299
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:58,330
- No, I'm sightseein'.
- Oh, really?

300
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:02,530
Yeah, I hate to use the word "tourist,"
but it's not like I can hide it.

301
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:05,030
Not really.

302
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:11,830
Aw, geez, you know, it took me three
hours just to get here from the airport.

303
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,330
I got so lost.
L.A. Is one large place.

304
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:18,030
Of course, you live here,
you probably don't notice.

305
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:21,530
- I'm such a yokel. There, I said it.
- Geez.

306
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:24,930
You know what?
I got gum on my seat.

307
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:27,340
Gum!

308
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,340
Excuse me.

309
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,440
- Morning.
- Hi.

310
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,740
Hey! Watch it!

311
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:40,050
I just couldn't handle
the freeways anymore.

312
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:42,050
I got so tense.

313
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:45,250
This way I can just relax
all the way to work.

314
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:48,950
Yeah, well, I love my car.
I miss my car.

315
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:04,950
<i>Oh, God, look at that. </i>

316
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:07,750
<i>- Hey, Sam!
- Shit!</i>

317
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,750
<i>- Sam!
- What?</i>

318
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:12,450
Why don't you just drive over
these people or something?

319
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:16,750
- Don't spit on my bus, Annie.
- Such a mess.

320
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:34,250
Stop!

321
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:43,150
- Open up!
- Get off the door, man! This ain't no bus stop!

322
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:46,250
- That guy really wants to get on the bus.
- Open up! Stop!

323
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,950
<i>Don't, Sam! Don't let him on!</i>

324
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:50,960
- L.A.P.D.!
- I can't hear you.

325
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,560
- Stop this bus!
- What?

326
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,560
<i>L.A.P.D.! Stop the bus!</i>

327
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:59,260
L.A.P.D.!

328
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,860
Stop! Stop!

329
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,360
Stop! L.A.P.D.!
Get out of the car!

330
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,360
Jesus, not again.
This is my car.

331
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,460
I own this car.
It's not stolen.

332
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,260
- It is now. Move over.
- Fuck! Oh, man.

333
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:20,960
You scratch this puppy, and me and you
are gonna have words, you understand?

334
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,560
Okay, look, man, we don't
have to go so fast, all right?

335
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:44,760
Just slow down a little bit,
all right, man? Just slow do...

336
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:48,960
Oh, shit! Oh, come on, man!

337
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:53,260
Just don't tear up my car,
all right? Okay, okay, okay.

338
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,860
<i>Just slow down
just a bit, all right?</i>

339
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:59,860
We don't have to go so fast, do we?
I mean, we don't... we don't have to go...

340
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:06,670
That was a nice move,
man. Whoo!

341
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:19,070
Shit, shit, shit, shit!
Oh, shit!

342
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:21,770
<i>The least you could do
is slow down! Come on!</i>

343
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:24,470
Holy shit! Oh, shit!

344
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:28,870
<i>- Oh, shit! What the... </i>

345
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:31,070
Move, move!

346
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:34,270
Is that that guy?

347
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:37,770
Man sure has a hard-on
for this bus.

348
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:55,870
Hey! I'm a cop!

349
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:59,870
- What?
- I'm a cop!

350
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:03,970
L.A.P.D.!
There's a bomb on your bus!

351
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:07,470
<i>- There's a bomb on your bus!
- What?</i>

352
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:10,070
There's a...
What? Fuck!

353
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:14,180
- There's a bomb on your bus!
- Watch the road!

354
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:17,280
Grab that, will ya?
I want you to write on it.

355
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:20,280
I want you to write
on the back, "Bomb on bus. "

356
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,580
Write it, write it,
write it!

357
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:43,080
Watch the road!
Oh, shit!

358
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:57,380
Oh, shit! No!

359
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,580
Don't slow down!

360
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,580
No, no!
No, no, no, no, no!

361
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,080
<i>Speed up!</i>

362
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:13,180
Op... Open your door!

363
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,580
<i>Open the doors!</i>

364
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,680
<i>Fifty! Stay above 50!</i>

365
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:23,390
<i>- Okay.
- All right?</i>

366
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:31,090
470-8000. Ask for
Detective Harry Temple.

367
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:36,890
Harry.
Harry, it's Jack.

368
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:41,090
Yeah.

369
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:44,990
You'd better not be calling in
sick, 'cause I dragged my ass out of...

370
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:47,390
- Harry, he's alive.
- What?

371
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:49,790
The bomber. He's back.

372
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:53,190
He hit one in Venice already.
Fire chief said there's nothin' left.

373
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:55,890
Temple, we just got a ransom demand
from your dead terrorist.

374
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:58,990
- Says he's rigged a city bus. Where's Jack?
- Where do you think?

375
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:01,990
- I gotta get on that bus.
- You gotta get...

376
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:04,090
Yeah, yeah,
you get on the bus.

377
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:09,090
Drive straight!
Stay in this lane!

378
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,690
Watch the road.

379
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:16,090
Wait a minute.
What are you doin'?

380
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:19,390
- Are you insured?
- Yeah. Why?

381
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:22,290
No! No!

382
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:28,590
Ah! Broke my-my door.

383
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:31,690
Sir, I need to take
your phone.

384
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:35,000
- Take the phone.
- Take the wheel.

385
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:40,600
<i>What are you... What?
Oh! Oh, shit! Oh, shit!</i>

386
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,700
Drive straight!

387
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,800
Oh, shit. Whoa, shit!

388
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Whoa, shit!

389
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,600
Whoa, shit!

390
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,600
This guy's out of his mind.

391
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,000
This guy's out of his mind.

392
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,700
Okay, listen.
You gotta stay above 50.

393
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,700
Excuse me.
Are you out of your mind?

394
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,400
<i>- Whatever it takes.
- Hello!</i>

395
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,900
Everybody,
I'm Jack Traven, L.A.P.D.

396
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
We have a slight situation on the bus
here. Ma'am, if you'll please sit down...

397
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,400
No, I won't sit down. You're scaring
the shit out of these people.

398
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,400
Ma'am, please!

399
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:50,210
If everybody will stay
in your seats and remain calm,

400
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:52,810
we should be able
to diffuse the problem.

401
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:56,310
- So sit tight and...
- Get away from me!

402
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:04,210
I don't know you, man. I'm not
here for you. Let's not do this.

403
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:07,410
- Stop the bus! Sit down!
- He can't! Listen...

404
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:12,010
<i>- Stop the bus! Stop it!
- Look, look! Listen!</i>

405
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:15,010
Look, I'm putting
my gun away, okay?

406
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:18,810
Okay?

407
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:25,610
Now, listen.
I don't care about your crime.

408
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:30,010
<i>Whatever you did,
I'm sure that you're sorry. </i>

409
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:32,510
So it's cool now.
It's over.

410
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:39,810
And I'm not a cop right now.

411
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:45,610
See? We're just two
cool guys just hangin' out...

412
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:48,710
<i>No, don't!</i>

413
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:51,410
Sam!

414
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:58,720
I've got the wheel!
I've got it! I've got it!

415
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:02,220
Sam! Oh, God, Sam!

416
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:07,120
<i>Sam, come on,
you gotta move your legs. </i>

417
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,320
<i>- Somebody move his legs!</i>

418
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,220
Sam, get your foot... Sam,
get your foot off the pedal!

419
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,320
We gotta stop this thing!

420
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:18,520
No! Don't!
Stay above 50!

421
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:21,120
But Sam's been shot!
We gotta get him off!

422
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:24,720
You slow down,
and this bus'll explode!

423
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,820
There is a bomb on this bus.

424
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,220
If we slow down, it'll blow.

425
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:40,420
<i>If anyone tries to get off,
it'll explode. </i>

426
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:44,520
<i>Bullshit! Yeah, there's a bomb.
Some funny joke, man!</i>

427
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,720
Are we gonna have
a problem now?

428
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:50,320
He's bleeding so much, I don't know
what to do. There's so much blood!

429
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:55,320
Put pressure front and back, keep
his legs up and put this under his head.

430
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:58,320
- Hold on, man. Hold on.
- Sam, lift your head.

431
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:02,020
- Miss, can you handle this bus?
- Oh, sure. It's just like driving a really big Pinto.

432
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:05,020
- I need to know, can you handle this bus?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

433
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:09,730
- Just tell me what the plan is. Is there a plan?
- Just for you to drive.

434
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:12,830
- We're okay for now. Just keep us above 50.
- Good plan.

435
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:18,730
<i>- So, you're a cop, right?
- That's right. </i>

436
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:21,330
Well, I should probably tell you
that I'm taking the bus...

437
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:23,430
because I had
my driver's license revoked.

438
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:26,730
- What for?
- Speeding.

439
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:32,430
Harry, we're on our way to the chopper.

440
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:34,930
If anything changes,
let us know.

441
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:39,230
Anything we haven't seen should be in here.

442
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:12,030
Something wrong with the
driver, that at least one car, a Jaguar,

443
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:14,830
has been driven off the road
by the speeding bus.

444
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:17,130
It appears it is somewhere
between Los Angeles...

445
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:20,240
<i>The bus apparently came onto the
freeway at the Lincoln on-ramp. </i>

446
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:23,840
<i>It began picking up speed,
swerving and hasn't slowed down since. </i>

447
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:27,340
Minutes ago, a Los Angeles
police officer boarded the bus...

448
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,640
<i>by jumping onto it
from a moving car. </i>

449
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,240
<i>- Oh, would that be you, Jack?
- He doesn't seem to have been able to stop the bus... </i>

450
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:34,740
- Where do we start?
- Check the speedometer.

451
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:37,940
Has it been fucked with
or loosened or any wires...

452
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,740
<i>- See any wires or anything?
- Excuse me, ma'am.</i>

453
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,540
- No, it's clean.
- Huh?

454
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:47,140
Then it's gonna be under the bus.
Probably it was rigged to one of the axles.

455
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:50,440
I can't get under the bus right now,
Harry. It's kind of in motion.

456
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:52,840
<i>Excuse me. Excuse me!</i>

457
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,040
Hold on.

458
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:57,840
There's an access panel
in the floor.

459
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:00,640
<i>Underneath you, man. </i>

460
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:06,040
All right, Harry, we're in.
Passenger relay. Sir!

461
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:09,440
Take this. I want you
to tell him what I see.

462
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:15,640
Okay! We got a wad!
Pretty big!

463
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:17,840
There's a pretty big wad.

464
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:20,040
<i>- Brass fittings!
- Brass fittings. </i>

465
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:23,540
- I think I can reach the circuit wire.
- He can reach the circuit wire.

466
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,540
No! No, no! D-Don't!
Don't do that!

467
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:28,140
- That's a decoy. Classic.
- That's a classic decoy.

468
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,440
- What else?
- What else?

469
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:33,150
<i>- Hold on.
- Hold on. </i>

470
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:43,350
Fuck me!

471
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,950
Oh, darn.

472
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:53,650
Harry, there's enough C-4 on this
thing to put a hole in the world.

473
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:55,650
Okay. All right.
Just stay calm.

474
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:57,650
- What else?
- Three triggers.

475
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:00,750
- One on the axle I can't really see, a cellular remote...
- Officer.

476
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:03,450
And a timer running
off a wristwatch.

477
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:06,650
- A watch? What kind of watch?
- Gold.

478
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:08,650
Gold band, fairly cheesy.

479
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:11,750
Officer. Officer!

480
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:13,850
What's on your mind, Harry?

481
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:16,950
Shit, what do I do?
Officer!

482
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:19,350
- What do I do? What do I... Which way?
- Aw, shit!

483
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:22,250
- Get on the shoulder.
- Okay.

484
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:37,450
Watch it, watch it!

485
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,160
Um, stay on or get off?

486
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:49,560
<i>- Stay on or get off?
- Off! Off! Hold on!</i>

487
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,760
Oh, God.

488
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:17,760
<i>- Keep going.
- It's red!</i>

489
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:21,460
- Go! Go!
- Wh-What? Ow! My foot!

490
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,660
This is much better.

491
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:41,960
The bus is on Western,

492
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:44,060
heading in a southbound
direction.

493
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,460
<i>Now, when the bus did exit here,
it had a couple of close calls... </i>

494
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,960
<i>with a few cars
on the Century Freeway. </i>

495
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:51,160
<i>Yeah, yeah!
All right! Oh. </i>

496
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:54,370
<i>We don't know what authorities
are planning to do, but we can... </i>

497
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:06,070
<i>- I don't get it. </i>

498
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:09,170
The watch is a shitty timer.
Why use it? What's he sayin'?

499
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:12,770
- Lots of people have watches, Harry.
- This guy has no M.O.

500
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:16,570
A bomber falls in love with one kind
of bomb, and they're very monogamous.

501
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:20,270
This guy uses C-4, dynamite,
different trigger every time,

502
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:22,270
and now he throws in
this watch.

503
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:25,370
He's an encyclopedia of bombs.
He knows every kind.

504
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:28,170
Yeah, and everything we do
to dismantle it.

505
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:33,170
Wait a minute.

506
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:36,670
I want to look at the files
for the last ten years.

507
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:39,470
We did the mug shots already.
That's not gonna help.

508
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:42,970
- No. I wanna look at cops.
- Come on. Let's go.

509
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:52,470
Yeah. Mac, where have you been?

510
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:55,570
I had to bail on the freeway.
We're in the city.

511
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:58,770
I can see you.
Just keep going straight.

512
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:01,270
<i>I'm gonna try
to clear the roads for you. </i>

513
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:04,070
Just stay on line.

514
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,880
<i>Shit! Oh, Jesus!
God! No!</i>

515
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:11,580
<i>- Go left!</i>

516
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,980
<i>- Sorry.
- Oh, my God!</i>

517
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:24,480
Oh, geez!

518
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:29,380
People, stay out of my way!
Stay out of my way!

519
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:33,280
- Ma'am, up to the right.
- Okay, okay, okay. I see it, I see it, I see it!

520
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:43,280
- Mac. Mac, you gotta get me out of here!
- Oh, God!

521
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:50,780
A few more blocks, you're gonna
come up to a soft turn, right.

522
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:54,380
<i>Then hold straight. I've got
some units waiting for you there. </i>

523
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,980
<i>They're gonna lead you
to the 105 Freeway. It's not in use. </i>

524
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:01,080
It'll be empty.
You'll be totally clear.

525
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:03,180
<i>Got it. </i>

526
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,580
<i>In a few blocks, we take
a soft turn to the right. </i>

527
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:10,780
- I'll find you.
- Okay.

528
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:14,680
Okay. Wait a minute.
Escort to where?

529
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:17,590
<i>- Where do we get an escort to?
- Watch out!</i>

530
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:19,890
<i>- Where? Where?</i>

531
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:22,990
Oh, God!

532
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:28,290
<i>Goddamn it! Son of a bitch!</i>

533
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:30,890
Oh, Jesus! Oh, no!

534
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:34,090
<i>My God! My God!
I just hit the baby!</i>

535
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:36,990
- Cans! Cans!
- I just hit the baby! Oh, my God!

536
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:39,690
- There was no baby. It was full of cans.
- Are you sure?

537
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:41,790
- Yes. Yes.
- Oh, my God!

538
00:50:57,490 --> 00:50:59,590
Okay, let's go.

539
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:03,890
Oh, Jesus!
No! No! Don't!

540
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:06,890
<i>- Get back!</i>

541
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:13,790
Why aren't they in school?
Why aren't you in school?

542
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:17,190
- Mac, we're boned.
- I'll get you out, Jack.

543
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:29,100
All right, listen. We got
an entrance coming up, Jack.

544
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,600
It's gonna be
a real ugly turn, though.

545
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,900
<i>- How ugly?
- What's ugly?</i>

546
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,900
Okay, we got a hard right comin' up
at the construction site.

547
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,700
<i>This should be it. </i>

548
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,300
<i>- That is a dead end.
- There's a turn. </i>

549
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,500
- I can't make that turn. No.
- You can make it. Keep left. You can make it wide.

550
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:49,700
Oh, God, we're gonna tip over.
We're gonna tip over.

551
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:54,100
You're right. We're gonna tip over.
Everyone on this side of the bus now!

552
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:57,200
On this side of the bus, as far as you can, please!

553
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:58,400
Hold on!

554
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,400
Hold on!

555
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:02,900
Over here, over here!
As far as you can, now!

556
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,800
Mac, you'd better
clear this site out.

557
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,600
<i>- Everybody hold on!
- This side of the bus!</i>

558
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,600
Hold on!

559
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,400
Hold on! Oh, God!
Here we go! Here we go!

560
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,100
<i>Here we go!</i>

561
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:45,010
Whoo! Oh, my God! Oh, God!
Is everybody all right?

562
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:47,310
Yes!

563
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:50,010
Take me to that interchange
at the 105!

564
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:04,310
Oh, my God! We might have died.
I can't think.

565
00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:08,710
It's okay. If you need to,
you go right ahead and vomit.

566
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:13,910
Hold it right there!

567
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:27,310
- Mac, I got 'em patched through!
- Right.

568
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:30,210
Get rid of that scaffolding
and replace it with webbing.

569
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:33,710
- Okay.
- Norwood, I want aerial units up ahead.

570
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:37,610
No obstructions in the freeway. We have a
window here. I wanna make sure it stays open.

571
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:40,610
- Right.
- You, sir. This gentleman's gonna drive you...

572
00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:52,020
<i>Thank goodness for this freeway. </i>

573
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:01,320
Shoot.

574
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:06,020
Could you do me a favor and hold
the wheel for me for a second?

575
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:08,620
Hold the wheel?
Thank you.

576
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,920
Ma'am, you did very well.

577
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:14,120
Actually, you were incredible.
I've never seen driving like that.

578
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:16,620
- Annie.
- What?

579
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,620
It's my name. Annie.

580
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:22,320
- Annie.
- As opposed to "ma'am. "

581
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:24,020
Okay.

582
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:31,320
So, why is all this
happening?

583
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:35,820
I mean, what did we do,
bomb the guy's country or something?

584
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,520
No, it's just a guy
who wants money.

585
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:43,320
I don't buy that. It's not
a very good way to make money.

586
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:48,120
So, um, what
is this guy's deal?

587
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:52,120
A while back
he held some people for ransom.

588
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:55,320
It went sour, and now
he's a little pissed at me.

589
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:57,920
What does that
have to do with us?

590
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:01,320
Nothing. It's a game.
If he gets the money, he wins.

591
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:03,330
If the bus blows up,
he wins.

592
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:06,630
- What if you win?
- Then tomorrow we'll play another one.

593
00:55:06,730 --> 00:55:09,730
But I'm not available
to drive tomorrow. Busy.

594
00:55:14,330 --> 00:55:16,730
<i>We got no match for that description. </i>

595
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:19,230
No one's lost a thumb for
at least the last ten years.

596
00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:22,130
- He could be from anywhere.
- I can't access all that.

597
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:25,830
Forget the files. I want you to
start going through the pension fund.

598
00:55:25,930 --> 00:55:29,730
This guy's drawin' disability. He may
not be L.A.P.D., but he's livin' here now.

599
00:55:29,830 --> 00:55:33,130
I want pictures!
I've seen this asshole.

600
00:55:47,330 --> 00:55:49,230
- Hey!
- Hey, Mac!

601
00:55:49,330 --> 00:55:51,330
Let's get these passengers
off the bus!

602
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:54,330
- We can't do it, sir.
- There's no time for any stunts, Traven.

603
00:55:54,430 --> 00:55:57,030
- We gotta get these people out of harm's way.
- I got orders!

604
00:55:57,130 --> 00:55:59,230
We move these people,
he'll see.

605
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:04,230
Remember...
crazy, not stupid.

606
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:07,230
All right, look. Harry's tryin'
to find out who this guy is.

607
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:10,030
- We think maybe he's a cop.
- Lieutenant!

608
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:13,640
It's him.
He wants to talk to Jack.

609
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:16,940
- He's on the line for you.
- Okay, give him the number.

610
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,940
Give him the number!

611
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:24,040
- How's he doing?
- The bleeding is less, but...

612
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:28,140
- Are they going to help us?
- Sure they are. They're the police.

613
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:32,640
Hey, your taxes are payin' their salary.
If we die, they gotta take a pay cut.

614
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,740
I mean, you know...

615
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,840
- Yeah.
- I think we have trust.

616
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:46,440
But it looks on TV like you're tryin'
to get those passengers off the bus.

617
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,140
Look, you gotta
let me have one.

618
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:52,140
- Now, we went over the rules.
- As an act of faith.

619
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,640
We have an injured man here.
The driver's been shot.

620
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:57,440
Jack, now tell me that you haven't
been shooting the passengers.

621
00:56:57,540 --> 00:57:00,240
I thought it was customary
for a police officer...

622
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:02,840
to, you know,
shoot the bad guys, huh?

623
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:06,840
- This man has no time.
- No one gets off!

624
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:10,040
It'll grease the wheels with the
money men if you show a little charity.

625
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:13,540
There's still gonna be
plenty of us to kill.

626
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:16,640
Okay, son, you can try
and unload the driver.

627
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:19,840
You tell that wildcat behind
the wheel not to slow down, though,

628
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:23,140
or he won't even get a chance
to bleed to death.

629
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:26,450
And Jack? Don't slip.

630
00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:31,150
- He's letting us unload the driver.
- Norwood, get us closer!

631
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:33,750
<i>- We're gonna get the bus driver off the bus!
- We're gonna get the driver off.</i>

632
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:36,050
- Just him?
- For now. Gigantor!

633
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:39,150
- Ortiz.
- Ortiz. I'm gonna need your help.

634
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:41,550
<i>- Okay.
- Okay, I need you to pass him to me.</i>

635
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:44,350
You have to keep him straight,
or I think the wound will tear.

636
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:47,550
- What about the rest of us? What about the rest of us?
- Hey, hey! Lady!

637
00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:52,050
- Come on, Sam. I got you.
- I can't stay! I can't...

638
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:55,050
- How you feelin'?
- Like I've been shot.

639
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:59,050
<i>- Take care, Sam.
- Okay, Annie.</i>

640
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:01,250
<i>- Drive straight!
- Keep it straight!</i>

641
00:58:03,950 --> 00:58:08,750
- Okay, Annie, get as close as you can, okay?
- All right.

642
00:58:08,850 --> 00:58:12,050
Closer!
A little closer, Annie!

643
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:15,750
- Annie, a little closer!
- Okay.

644
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:19,050
<i>- Okay, how's this?</i>

645
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:26,950
- Sorry! Sorry.
- Okay, Annie, no problem. Let's try it one more time.

646
00:58:28,850 --> 00:58:32,650
<i>A little more! Okay! Okay!
Right there! Steady!</i>

647
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:34,750
Hold it steady!

648
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:37,660
You got him? You got him?

649
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,760
- Hold him!
- I got him! We're clear!

650
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:45,860
- All right! Oh.
- I'm all right. Thanks.

651
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,960
Oh, my God.

652
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:51,160
Yes! Oh!

653
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:01,460
It's gonna be okay.

654
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:06,460
Come on! Come on, lady,
give me your hand!

655
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:10,560
<i>- I have to, Annie.
- No, Helen! No, Helen, no!</i>

656
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:12,760
- Come on! Right there! Over there!
- Helen, no! No!

657
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:17,060
Here at the 105 Freeway
where the police have successfully led...

658
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:19,460
<i>- the runaway bus... </i>

659
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:23,360
No, Helen!

660
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:41,260
Goddamn it, Mac! We gotta get
those fuckin' choppers out of here!

661
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:44,660
...was driving the bus.
Well, I couldn't tell how old...

662
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:47,170
An explosion.
Some kind of an explosion.

663
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:50,770
<i>The bus hasn't exploded, but...
Oh, my God. </i>

664
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:52,670
A woman caught
in the blast fell.

665
00:59:52,770 --> 00:59:55,270
She was pulled under the wheels.
This is terrible.

666
00:59:55,370 --> 00:59:59,470
Interactive TV, Jack. Wave
of the future! Huh?

667
01:00:21,370 --> 01:00:23,570
I can't be here.

668
01:00:25,070 --> 01:00:27,070
I can't, you know.

669
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:30,270
<i>This is the wrong bus. </i>

670
01:00:30,370 --> 01:00:32,370
I mean, for me to...

671
01:00:33,470 --> 01:00:35,270
I can't die here.

672
01:00:36,370 --> 01:00:39,170
Hey, shut up, man.

673
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:41,770
- I got a wife.
- Oh, you do?

674
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:44,170
Hey! So if you
have a wife...

675
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:46,570
<i>and I don't, does that
mean I'm expendable?</i>

676
01:00:46,670 --> 01:00:48,970
Hey, what are you
talkin' about, man?

677
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:51,970
The guy's just talkin' crazy.
It gets on my nerves.

678
01:00:52,070 --> 01:00:54,870
<i>- Gets on everybody's nerves.
- Oh, yeah?</i>

679
01:00:54,970 --> 01:00:57,370
- I think I have the right to be a little bit upset...
- What are you staring at anyway?

680
01:00:57,470 --> 01:00:59,880
<i>After all that we've... </i>

681
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:02,980
<i>Why don't you just let everybody
die in peace, if that's what's gonna happen, huh?</i>

682
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:04,980
<i>So you're a tough guy, huh?
I got a right to be upset. </i>

683
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:08,180
<i>You're really tough, huh, Gigantor?
Why don't we just step outside?</i>

684
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:10,580
Hey!

685
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:27,280
- How are you doing? You all right?
- Mm-mm.

686
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:29,580
What can I do?

687
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:33,680
When that bomb went off...

688
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:35,680
I know.

689
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:39,580
I thought that was it. I thought
that was the bomb and I was dead.

690
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:43,280
And then when I saw her body fall
under the bus, it was like...

691
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:47,980
- You were glad you were still alive.
- Mm-hmm.

692
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:52,380
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't be.

693
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,980
You should be glad.
We all are.

694
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:00,280
- It doesn't mean you don't care.
- I know, but she was so scared.

695
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:03,380
<i>She was scared. She was a nice lady
who didn't deserve to get killed.</i>

696
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:06,780
But, Annie, if she'd gotten off,
it would've killed us all.

697
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:10,690
He's the asshole, Annie, the guy who
put us here. Remember that, okay?

698
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:12,990
Big asshole.

699
01:02:14,290 --> 01:02:16,190
Okay.

700
01:02:19,090 --> 01:02:21,290
Are you sure?

701
01:02:21,490 --> 01:02:23,390
Well, how far?

702
01:02:26,390 --> 01:02:28,690
Sir, uh, we have
a serious problem.

703
01:02:29,890 --> 01:02:34,390
- What?
- This freeway isn't finished.

704
01:02:34,490 --> 01:02:38,090
- What are you talking about?
- The aerial unit caught it about three miles ahead.

705
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:40,790
There's a section missing.

706
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:42,890
Section missing?

707
01:02:47,690 --> 01:02:50,690
But it's on the map.
It's finished on the goddamn map!

708
01:02:51,990 --> 01:02:53,990
I guess they fell behind.

709
01:02:55,490 --> 01:02:58,790
Fuck. You're fired!
Everybody's fuckin' fired!

710
01:03:00,090 --> 01:03:01,990
Get me closer!

711
01:03:02,090 --> 01:03:05,790
Hey, get closer.
Watch him in the mirror.

712
01:03:05,890 --> 01:03:07,390
Jack!

713
01:03:10,790 --> 01:03:14,490
- How big is the section?
- Fifty feet. At least.

714
01:03:19,790 --> 01:03:23,000
There's a gap in the road
up ahead. It's big.

715
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:25,500
You're kidding.
How big?

716
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:28,700
<i>- Fifty feet. Jack.
- What?</i>

717
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,700
We gotta get these people
off the bus somehow.

718
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:34,800
You know I can't.

719
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:38,400
<i>What did...
What did he say? Jack?</i>

720
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:41,200
Jack, what'd he say?

721
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:45,000
<i>What's the matter?</i>

722
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:52,100
- There's a gap in the freeway.
- What?

723
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:57,000
- What do you mean?
- How big is a gap?

724
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:59,400
Fifty feet.
A couple of miles ahead.

725
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:03,400
- This is crazy.
- Right along up there?

726
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:07,800
- What is this?
- Geez.

727
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:10,500
<i>Jack! Jack!</i>

728
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:13,200
<i>What if I shift into neutral
and just keep the engine revving?</i>

729
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:16,900
<i>- No, he'd have thought of that.
- Then what then? What? What?</i>

730
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,600
- What? Jack!
- Floor it.

731
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:22,700
<i>- What?
- Floor it!</i>

732
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:26,200
<i>- It's an interchange.
Might be an incline. Floor it! - Fine.</i>

733
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,710
Everybody, hold onto your seats
or whatever you can.

734
01:04:33,810 --> 01:04:36,710
When we hit the gap,
heads down.

735
01:04:36,810 --> 01:04:39,310
That's it? That's it?

736
01:04:39,410 --> 01:04:43,510
That's all we can do. Let's put these
underneath your seat, all right?

737
01:04:43,610 --> 01:04:46,910
Put your bags
underneath the seat.

738
01:04:51,510 --> 01:04:53,910
Hey, I didn't mean
to shoot the guy.

739
01:04:54,010 --> 01:04:56,410
Hold on.

740
01:04:56,510 --> 01:04:59,310
Is this really gonna work?

741
01:04:59,410 --> 01:05:01,710
<i>Jack!</i>

742
01:05:01,810 --> 01:05:05,910
- Yeah.
- Jack.

743
01:05:27,610 --> 01:05:29,510
<i>- Come on, come on, come on, come on.
- Oh, God. </i>

744
01:05:29,610 --> 01:05:32,210
<i>- Come on, come on. Come on!
- God. </i>

745
01:05:32,310 --> 01:05:34,110
Oh, God.

746
01:05:41,610 --> 01:05:43,920
Oh, shit.

747
01:05:56,720 --> 01:06:00,120
Everybody, hold on!

748
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:14,820
I wanna see our baby.

749
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:19,420
Oh, God. Jack.

750
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:27,320
Shit!

751
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:48,820
<i>Okay. Okay. </i>

752
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:50,920
Yes!

- You okay? You okay?
- Yeah. I'm okay. I'm okay.

755
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:07,430
All right! All right!
Let's go!

756
01:07:07,530 --> 01:07:10,330
- Is everybody okay?
- Yes! Yes!

757
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:16,230
- We made it!
- We made it.

758

<i>You are the man.
You are the man!</i>

759

<i>- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Goddamn! Yes!</i>

760
01:07:25,830 --> 01:07:27,930
- Oh, shit.
- I think you missed your calling.

761
01:07:28,030 --> 01:07:30,930
Yeah? What was it?

762
01:07:31,030 --> 01:07:33,830
Watch the road.
You should've been a pilot.

763
01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:37,930
Ow.

764
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:42,330
- Jesus.
- Get off!

765
01:07:42,430 --> 01:07:44,530
- What?
- Get off this.

766
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:47,030
Now, now! Get off this!

767
01:07:51,330 --> 01:07:53,230
In there.

768
01:07:53,330 --> 01:07:56,530
- Where, right here? Right here?
- Yeah. Yeah.

769
01:08:00,530 --> 01:08:03,230
Hey. Hey, hey,
stop! Stop!

770
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:14,740
- He's just entered the airport.
- All right!

771
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:17,240
- There's thousands of people there.
- That's my boy, Jack.

772
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:19,640
He should be able to circle
the runways and buy us some time.

773
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:22,440
<i>The choppers can't fly in there.
It's restricted airspace. </i>

774
01:08:22,540 --> 01:08:24,940
He's headed for
the end of the field.

775
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:27,240
That must be Bravo Tango,
an emergency runway.

776
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:29,840
Yeah, let's hope it's built.
Let's move!

777
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:44,740
We're at the airport.

778
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:47,840
Yeah. So?

779
01:08:47,940 --> 01:08:50,440
I already seen
the airport.

780
01:09:09,940 --> 01:09:11,840
Yeah?

781
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:14,840
Very, very exciting, Jack.

782
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:16,940
Some close calls, huh?

783
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:20,250
- But you've done all right for yourself.
- What do you want?

784
01:09:20,350 --> 01:09:22,250
I want money, Jack.

785
01:09:22,350 --> 01:09:24,950
I wish, uh, that I had
some loftier purpose,

786
01:09:25,050 --> 01:09:28,650
but, um, I'm afraid in the end
it's just the money, Jack.

787
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:30,750
I would like, uh,

788
01:09:30,850 --> 01:09:32,850
large, uh,
nonsequential bills...

789
01:09:32,950 --> 01:09:35,950
in two clear plastic
bags, unmarked.

790
01:09:36,050 --> 01:09:39,950
- Can you remember all that?
- What are you telling me for?

791
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:43,150
Because I want you to help me
to get it before it gets too late.

792
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:46,950
I hate negotiators, Jack. They talk
to you like they're your best friend,

793
01:09:47,050 --> 01:09:49,050
and they don't even know ya.

794
01:09:49,150 --> 01:09:51,650
Why are they messing
with me, huh?

795
01:09:51,750 --> 01:09:53,950
Do they think I'm
doin' this for fun?

796
01:09:54,050 --> 01:09:57,450
- Aren't you?
- Oh, that's unfair, Jack.

797
01:09:57,550 --> 01:10:01,950
You don't know how I feel about this.
You don't even know me.

798
01:10:02,050 --> 01:10:04,450
I know you want a shitload
of money you didn't earn.

799
01:10:04,550 --> 01:10:06,550
Oh, I earned it.

800
01:10:06,650 --> 01:10:09,050
I spent my life earning it.

801
01:10:09,150 --> 01:10:14,750
<i>I got a medal, too, Jack. A medal and a
pink slip and a "sorry about your hand. "</i>

802
01:10:14,850 --> 01:10:19,650
- You have to let me off.
- Oh, no! That's not good.

803
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:22,550
You want me to help you? I need
to talk to these people face-to-face.

804
01:10:22,650 --> 01:10:24,950
They think you're bullshit.

805
01:10:25,050 --> 01:10:26,950
They don't think that.

806
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:31,660
Look, you want the money, I don't want
anyone else to die. Let me get on the ground.

807
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,960
Just me.
That's not against the rules.

808
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:39,760
- All right. I want you back real fast.
- Fine.

809
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:43,760
Jack, nothing tricky now.
You know that I'm on top of you.

810
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:47,660
Do not attempt
to grow a brain.

811
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:50,260
It could encourage other terrorists...

812
01:10:55,660 --> 01:10:57,660
So I guess
there's a plan now?

813
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:59,660
Could be.

814
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,660
- Yeah?
- He's letting me off.

815
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:05,260
<i>- What?
- Just keep circling. You'll be fine. </i>

816
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:09,460
Everybody, sit tight.
I'm getting off for a minute.

817
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:11,860
- Do you think that's a good idea?
- It'll be okay.

818
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:14,760
- What, are you just gonna leave us here?
- I would.

819
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:16,960
Don't worry.
I won't go far.

820
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:20,660
<i>Hey. Don't forget
about us. </i>

821
01:11:35,860 --> 01:11:39,870
- The choppers are gone, Jack. Let's dump the passengers now.
- No way. He's ready for that.

822
01:11:39,970 --> 01:11:43,270
- How is that possible?
- I don't know how, Mac. I just know he is.

823
01:11:43,370 --> 01:11:47,070
He's been a step ahead every time. If we
unload, he'll take them out, I guarantee.

824
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:51,170
- So where does that put us?
- I have to try and dismantle that bomb.

825

That's an incredible ride...

<i>He didn't have to get on the bus
in the first place, Ortiz.</i>

Hey, get your ass
behind the yellow line.

832
01:12:25,070 --> 01:12:27,770
What is that?

833
01:12:32,270 --> 01:12:34,170
<i>I have no idea. </i>

834
01:12:37,370 --> 01:12:39,970
We won't be able to hold
this thing steady for very long.

835
01:12:40,070 --> 01:12:44,670
I just need a few minutes. If I can't
do it by then, I can't do it at all.

836
01:12:44,770 --> 01:12:48,270
- Harry, you with me?
- Yeah. You be careful, Jack.

837
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:56,680
<i>What is he doing?
Oh, my God, he is insane.</i>

838
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:06,580
<i>Okay, Jack, this is it.
Don't get dead. </i>

839
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:23,480
- This is not a very good plan.
- Have faith, sister.

840
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:25,680
Oh, Christ.

841
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:37,380
Just keep it steady.

842
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:39,780
Oh, thank you for
the tip, Ortiz.

843

<i>- This guy is nuts!
- Gosh darn.</i>

844

We're gonna have to try to bypass
the remote current with the battery.

845
01:13:57,980 --> 01:13:59,980
Can you find the trip
wire for the remote?

846
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,590
I don't know.
I got a few choices here.

847
01:14:02,690 --> 01:14:05,590
- Black and red?
- And green.

848
01:14:05,690 --> 01:14:10,090
Okay. All right. I'm gonna guess he's not
gonna go with standard copper for the remote.

849
01:14:10,190 --> 01:14:12,490
That'd be too weak.
I'd use a fiber alloy.

850
01:14:12,590 --> 01:14:15,690
Jack, I'm gonna need
you to look at the wire.

851
01:14:17,690 --> 01:14:20,290
- Harry, it's covered.
- Yeah, I know.

852
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:23,190
You're gonna have to cut off
the sheath. But don't cut the wire.

853
01:14:23,290 --> 01:14:25,190
Right.

854
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:39,790

want you to clip on the battery...

857
01:14:51,690 --> 01:14:54,590
- and then run it to the lead wire.
- Copy.

858
01:15:11,490 --> 01:15:13,900
I can't bypass. It'll fire.

859

895
01:18:17,420 --> 01:18:21,820
- You are a complete jerk! You know that?
- Oh, thank God!

896
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:25,520
- Did ya have any luck with the bomb?
- Yeah. It didn't go off.

897
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:30,420
<i>- Ortiz, thanks.
- How many lives you got, man?</i>

898
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:33,920
<i>You're not too bright, man,</i>

899
01:18:34,020 --> 01:18:37,820
<i>but you got some big,
round, hairy cojones. </i>

900
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:43,420
That's... very gross, Ortiz.

901
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:45,720
Can't even pay him
a compliment.

902
01:18:47,630 --> 01:18:50,830
- How you doin'?
- You scared the shit out of me, Jack! Ow.

903
01:18:50,930 --> 01:18:53,230
Other than that,
I'm fine.

904
01:18:53,330 --> 01:18:55,330
What is that smell?

905
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:57,930
- It's gas.
- We're leaking gas?

906
01:18:58,030 --> 01:18:59,530
We are now.

907
01:19:03,330 --> 01:19:05,930
What, you thought you needed
another challenge or something?

908
01:19:06,030 --> 01:19:09,630
- Mac.
- Mac here. Go ahead.

909
01:19:09,730 --> 01:19:12,530
Can you get a fuel truck
to pace us here? We're losing gas.

910
01:19:12,630 --> 01:19:15,930
- I'll see what I can find. How much time?
- I don't know. Ten minutes.

911
01:19:16,030 --> 01:19:19,230
- It doesn't look good.
- Got ya.

912
01:19:19,330 --> 01:19:22,330
<i>- Norwood, get a fuel car out here on the double.
- Right. </i>

913
01:19:22,430 --> 01:19:25,230
Is that gonna work?

914
01:19:25,330 --> 01:19:27,730
I don't know.

915
01:19:30,030 --> 01:19:33,230
Come on, Harry.
Save my life.

916
01:21:05,540 --> 01:21:08,340
Harry, tell me good news, man.

917
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:11,250
Oh, I'm sorry, Jack.
He didn't make it.

918
01:21:13,150 --> 01:21:15,250
You fuck!

919
01:21:16,750 --> 01:21:20,350
It was the watch that
led him to me, wasn't it?

920
01:21:20,450 --> 01:21:23,850
Huh? It seemed a little hammy
to me to build the bomb...

921
01:21:23,950 --> 01:21:25,950
out of my precious
retirement gift.

922
01:21:26,050 --> 01:21:30,050
But, you know, I figured
a sign that said Howard Payne...

923
01:21:30,150 --> 01:21:32,450
would be pushing it.

924
01:21:33,950 --> 01:21:37,250
I'm gonna rip your fuckin'
spine out, I swear to God.

925
01:21:37,350 --> 01:21:39,450
You're gonna do exactly
as you're told.

926
01:21:39,550 --> 01:21:44,350
Jack, we both know that he was
the brains of your particular operation.

927
01:21:44,450 --> 01:21:47,350
You can't beat me.
You're gonna pay me every dollar.

928
01:21:47,450 --> 01:21:52,150
Otherwise, you, the wildcat and
every innocent person on that bus...

929
01:21:52,250 --> 01:21:55,950
are gonna end up
just like your friend.

930
01:21:56,050 --> 01:21:59,850
Are you paying attention?
Jack, are you listening to me?

931
01:22:01,550 --> 01:22:04,350
- Jack? Jack!
- Yeah.

932
01:22:04,450 --> 01:22:06,850
Good. Now, you tell them...

933
01:22:06,950 --> 01:22:09,450
that the drop point
is Pershing Square.

934
01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:14,050
<i>There's a garbage can
on the northeast corner. </i>

935
01:22:14,150 --> 01:22:16,550
<i>You drop the bags and leave. </i>

936
01:22:16,650 --> 01:22:19,550
I don't show until all
your people are gone.

937
01:22:19,650 --> 01:22:22,860
It's gettin' on
to 11:00 a. m., Jack,

938
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:27,960
and I think it's gonna
be a very pretty day.

939
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:39,260
- Jack!
- Damn it!

940
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:41,560
Jack. Come on, Jack.

941
01:22:41,660 --> 01:22:45,160
<i>Don't give up on me, Jack.
Come on, please. Jack, stop it!</i>

942
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:49,460
Jack, come on! Stop it, okay? Don't
give up on me right now, all right?

943
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:54,560
<i>Hey, we're really scared,
and we need you right now. </i>

944
01:22:54,660 --> 01:22:58,560
I can't do this by myself.
Please? Jack, please.

945
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:07,060
Okay? Please.
All right?

946
01:23:12,860 --> 01:23:16,660
- We're gonna die.
- No, we're not. We got this far, okay?

947
01:23:39,070 --> 01:23:41,470
I'll be damned.

948
01:23:44,670 --> 01:23:48,370
<i>You go to the University
of Arizona?</i>

949
01:23:48,470 --> 01:23:50,770
- Yeah. So?
- Good football team.

950
01:23:50,870 --> 01:23:54,470
Yeah, I guess so.
I don't really know.

951
01:23:54,570 --> 01:23:56,470
Arizona Wildcats.

952
01:23:58,270 --> 01:24:01,070
- Right.
- He can see you.

953
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:04,670
- What?
- He can see you.

954
01:24:04,770 --> 01:24:07,170
- He can see me...
- Just keep looking straight ahead.

955
01:24:22,570 --> 01:24:25,870
He called you a wildcat before.
I didn't even pick up on it.

956
01:24:25,970 --> 01:24:29,070
The bastard's got a camera right
in your face. He can see the whole bus.

957
01:24:29,170 --> 01:24:31,070
He's been playing me
from minute one.

958
01:24:31,170 --> 01:24:33,170
He can see me,
but can he hear me?

959
01:24:33,270 --> 01:24:35,470
It doesn't look like it.
He's just watching you.

960
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:38,170
<i>This is a special news bulletin.
We are following the progress... </i>

961
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:40,870
<i>of what is turning out to be
a harrowing and amazing story... </i>

962
01:24:40,970 --> 01:24:43,970
as a city bus, rigged to
explode if it slows down,

963
01:24:44,070 --> 01:24:47,280
races around literally in circles
at the Los Angeles airport.

964
01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:50,580
The two dead are a female passenger
and the driver of another bus,

965
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:52,480
<i>both blown up by the bomber. </i>

966
01:24:52,580 --> 01:24:55,280
<i>The other people in jeopardy
are the passengers of the bus... </i>

967
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:57,280
held hostage at
the whim of a madman.

968
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:04,480
"The whim of a madman. "
I like that.

969
01:25:04,580 --> 01:25:08,480
<i> There's a camera on the bus
just over my left shoulder. </i>

970
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:11,480
<i>I want you to stare
straight ahead. </i>

971
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:15,180
<i>Don't make any big
movements. Okay?</i>

972
01:25:16,780 --> 01:25:20,180
It's Jack.
Yeah, I know about Harry.

973
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:25,280
Is that news van
still around?

974
01:25:25,380 --> 01:25:29,080
- Get those cameras to stop taping.
- Right.

975
01:25:29,180 --> 01:25:32,980
- L.A.P.D. I need this unit. You can broadcast U.H.F.?
- Yeah, sure.

976
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:36,980
There's a signal going to that bus.
I want you to find it.

977
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:39,480
<i> We're gonna have to
take you off the air temporarily. </i>

978
01:25:39,580 --> 01:25:42,280
- Please, sir, stop taping.
- Come on. Come on.

979
01:25:42,380 --> 01:25:45,280
<i>Hurry up. Good!
Tape off of that. </i>

980
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:52,380
Remember, no big movements.
Just look whipped.

981
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:54,980
That ain't gonna be too hard.

982
01:26:06,590 --> 01:26:09,590
- Tape it. Good. Come on, tape it!
- It's taping!

983
01:26:19,390 --> 01:26:21,290
- Jack.
- Yeah.

984
01:26:21,490 --> 01:26:23,390
Look.

985
01:26:26,590 --> 01:26:30,090
- Mac. Fuel.
- Yeah. Jack, five minutes.

986
01:26:30,190 --> 01:26:33,090
- Not enough time. Run the tape. We have to unload.
- I...

987
01:26:33,190 --> 01:26:35,990
- I only have a minute of tape.
- Do it now!

988
01:26:36,090 --> 01:26:39,890
<i>I want you to make a tape and loop
it so that it runs over and over. </i>

989
01:26:42,790 --> 01:26:47,490
- All right, run it. Run it!
- All right. Tape's rolling.

990
01:26:47,590 --> 01:26:49,590
<i>We still have no live picture,</i>

991
01:26:49,790 --> 01:26:54,290
<i>But reports are that the bus continues
to circle inside L.A. X... </i>

992
01:26:54,490 --> 01:26:58,090
<i>and that everyone is
safe for the moment. </i>

993
01:26:58,190 --> 01:27:01,790
<i>Hard to imagine what's going through
their thoughts at this time. </i>

994
01:27:01,890 --> 01:27:04,390
<i>Certainly, a sense
of community... </i>

995
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:25,700
Rig the steering wheel
and the gas pedal.

996
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:30,900
All right, let's get 'em off.
Just step and walk.

997
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,200
Okay, you, you and you.

998
01:27:34,300 --> 01:27:36,600
<i> Police have
just issued a general statement,</i>

999
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:39,400
<i>which really doesn't tell us much more
than all the previous statements. </i>

1000
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:42,900
Grab my wrist.
That's it. Good.

1001
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,500
<i>Come on.
Look straight ahead. </i>

1002
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:50,900
Watch your head, ma'am.

1003
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,300
Come on.

1004
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:04,300
It's okay.

1005
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:08,000
- That's good. That's good.
- Grab my wrist and come across.

1006
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:10,300
- Put your hand out. Take his hand.
- Don't look down.

1007
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:12,400
Good. That's it.
Come on. That's it.

1008
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:16,500
You got it.
Come on. Come on.

1009
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:19,210
<i>Let's go. </i>

1010

1011

<i> Give me your hand.

<i>- Hold on now. I got ya.

- Shit.
- Hold on! Hold on!

1015

Jack!

1016
01:28:41,810 --> 01:28:44,710
Grab my hand! My hand!
Grab my hand!

1017
01:28:44,810 --> 01:28:48,410
All right. All right!

1018
01:28:52,210 --> 01:28:55,010
Jack! Jack, I can't
hold this anymore.

1019
01:28:55,110 --> 01:28:58,810
Annie. Hold on!

1020
01:29:00,410 --> 01:29:03,710
Jesus, Jack! No, no.

1021
01:29:03,810 --> 01:29:06,510
No.

1022
01:29:06,610 --> 01:29:10,610
<i>Hold it. Jack. </i>

1023
01:29:15,310 --> 01:29:17,610
- Oh, God.
- Wedge down the gas pedal.

1024
01:29:17,710 --> 01:29:20,010
Okay.

1025
01:29:21,410 --> 01:29:23,310
Okay, I got it.

1026
01:29:34,420 --> 01:29:36,820
- You got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

1027
01:29:44,020 --> 01:29:46,520
I got it. Okay.

1028
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:49,620
- Okay, Annie, get on.
- God, I can't do this. Jack, I can't do this.

1029
01:29:50,820 --> 01:29:54,220
- Let's go, let's go!
- Shit. Shit.

1030
01:29:55,820 --> 01:29:57,720
- Jack.
- Shit!

1031
01:29:59,420 --> 01:30:02,520
- Hold on!
- Okay. Okay.

1032
01:31:26,030 --> 01:31:27,930
Shit!

1033
01:31:35,030 --> 01:31:37,330
Are you all right?

1034
01:31:38,430 --> 01:31:40,730
No.

1035
01:31:40,830 --> 01:31:44,130
It's okay. It's okay.
It's over.

1036
01:31:44,230 --> 01:31:48,730
It's over, Annie.
You did it. You did it.

1037
01:31:50,230 --> 01:31:52,040
Oh, fuck.

1038
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:55,340
Oh, I hate the airport.

1039
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:59,540
Yeah.

1040
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:03,940
You're not gonna get
mushy on me, are ya?

1041
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:08,940
Maybe. I might.

1042
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:13,140
Hope not, 'cause, you know,

1043
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:15,940
relationships that start under
intense circumstances, they never last.

1044
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:20,040
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. I've done extensive studying on this.

1045
01:32:20,140 --> 01:32:22,240
Here comes the cavalry.

1046
01:32:37,940 --> 01:32:39,840
How you doin'?

1047
01:32:39,940 --> 01:32:41,940
We're okay. We're okay.

1048
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:45,340
Well, I just might be a nice guy and
let you have the rest of the day off.

1049
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:47,540
Oh, boy.

1050
01:32:48,740 --> 01:32:51,340
Mac, this is Annie.

1051
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:54,440
Annie, meet
Lieutenant McMahon.

1052
01:32:54,540 --> 01:32:56,940
- How're you doing?
- Okay.

1053
01:32:57,140 --> 01:33:00,340
- This should take care of it.
- Ow!

1054
01:33:00,440 --> 01:33:03,350
- Watch it.
- I'm sorry.

1055
01:33:03,450 --> 01:33:05,950
We're gonna take you guys back
and have you checked out.

1056
01:33:06,150 --> 01:33:08,550
Lieutenant!

1057
01:33:08,650 --> 01:33:11,550
<i>It's him. He wants to know
when he's gonna get his money. </i>

1058
01:33:11,650 --> 01:33:14,550
Son of a bitch. I can tell him
what to do with his goddamn money.

1059
01:33:14,650 --> 01:33:16,950
He doesn't know
it blew up.

1060
01:33:19,850 --> 01:33:21,850
Thirty minutes.

1061
01:34:01,750 --> 01:34:04,050
I'll be right back.

1062
01:34:07,050 --> 01:34:09,150
- All right, here's our target. Fox?
- Yes, sir.

1063
01:34:09,350 --> 01:34:12,950
I want you in four-one, you in one-two,
and you're in three. Let's move it.

1064
01:34:13,050 --> 01:34:16,260
<i>- Norwood, are you sure the paint
bomb is in with the money? - It's done, sir. </i>

1065
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:19,560
Too bad, Jack.
You could've made a good cop.

1066
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:24,960
Okay.

1067
01:35:25,060 --> 01:35:27,370
<i>We still have no live picture,</i>

1068
01:35:27,470 --> 01:35:32,370
<i>but reports are that the bus continues
to circle inside L.A.X.</i>

1069
01:35:32,470 --> 01:35:35,770
<i>Potentially a disastrous situation,
and it's been defused to some extent. </i>

1070
01:35:35,870 --> 01:35:40,070
<i>However, there are still
a number of... </i>

1071
01:35:40,170 --> 01:35:42,870
No! No!

1072
01:36:06,670 --> 01:36:08,570
Miss. You can't
be this close.

1073
01:36:08,670 --> 01:36:11,270
- You need to move back.
- Oh, no. Jack Traven said that...

1074
01:36:11,370 --> 01:36:15,870
Jack Traven, yes, he asked that you be brought
out of harm's way. Just move right over here.

1075
01:36:16,070 --> 01:36:18,170
He's running a little late.

1076
01:36:18,270 --> 01:36:20,170
He's not late.

1077
01:36:21,370 --> 01:36:23,970
- What?
- He's never late.

1078
01:36:24,070 --> 01:36:26,270
<i>Well, that money
hasn't moved. </i>

1079
01:36:26,370 --> 01:36:29,770
We got 200 eyes on that can
and a bird dog in the bag.

1080
01:36:29,870 --> 01:36:32,170
I'd say he's covered.

1081
01:36:36,570 --> 01:36:38,880
- Turn it on.
- What for? It hasn't moved.

1082
01:36:38,980 --> 01:36:40,880
Just do it!

1083
01:36:48,180 --> 01:36:51,880
<i>- Shit, it's moving. He's got the money.
- Jack!</i>

1084
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:03,580
Shit!

1085
01:37:20,580 --> 01:37:22,280
Freeze!

1086
01:37:22,380 --> 01:37:25,980
<i>Pop quiz, asshole. </i>

1087
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:30,080
You have a hair trigger aimed
at your head. What do you do?

1088
01:37:30,180 --> 01:37:32,580
What do you do?

1089
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:34,980
Turn around.

1090
01:37:35,080 --> 01:37:36,980
<i>Turn around!</i>

1091
01:37:55,090 --> 01:37:56,990
Oh, no.

1092
01:37:57,090 --> 01:37:59,490
I'm sorry.

1093
01:38:01,090 --> 01:38:05,590
Be prepared. It's the Boy Scout
marching song.

1094
01:38:05,690 --> 01:38:09,390
What are you gonna do, Jack?
I don't think you can shoot her.

1095
01:38:09,490 --> 01:38:11,390
Let her go.

1096
01:38:12,890 --> 01:38:15,490
No, I don't think
I'm gonna do that.

1097
01:38:15,590 --> 01:38:17,490
Fill it.

1098
01:38:17,590 --> 01:38:19,590
Now.

1099
01:38:22,190 --> 01:38:24,590
Well, I think Harry would
be very disappointed,

1100
01:38:24,690 --> 01:38:27,590
feeling that we're right back
where we started, huh?

1101
01:38:27,690 --> 01:38:32,290
Let her go. You don't need her. You have
the money. Take it and walk. Come on.

1102
01:38:32,390 --> 01:38:34,990
<i>Just take it and walk.
You don't need her. </i>

1103
01:38:35,090 --> 01:38:37,190
- Just take your goddamn money and walk!
- Hey, hey!

1104
01:38:37,390 --> 01:38:41,590
Stay right there! Stay right there.
I'll do it. I'll let go. I'll let go.

1105
01:38:41,690 --> 01:38:43,590
Oh, yeah.

1106
01:38:43,690 --> 01:38:48,390
You still don't get it, do you, Jack?
Huh? The beauty of it.

1107
01:38:48,490 --> 01:38:52,290
<i>A bomb is made to explode. </i>

1108
01:38:52,390 --> 01:38:55,390
<i>That's its meaning, its purpose.
Your life is empty... </i>

1109
01:38:55,490 --> 01:38:58,090
<i>because you spend it
trying to stop the bomb... </i>

1110
01:38:58,190 --> 01:39:00,600
from becoming.

1111
01:39:00,700 --> 01:39:04,000
And for who? For what?

1112
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:07,800
Do you know what a bomb is,
Jack, that doesn't explode?

1113
01:39:07,900 --> 01:39:12,500
It is a cheap
gold watch, buddy.

1114
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:15,600
You're crazy.
You're fuckin' crazy.

1115
01:39:15,700 --> 01:39:20,000
Oh. No, poor people
are crazy, Jack.

1116
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:23,500
I'm eccentric. Get the money.
Let's go. Come on!

1117
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:25,700
<i>Let's go! Move it!
Move it!</i>

1118
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:28,100
You stay! Move it!
Move it!

1119
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:31,200
<i>In the door!
In that door, now!</i>

1120
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:35,500
Bye, Jack. Punk.

1121
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:42,600
All right!

1122
01:39:42,700 --> 01:39:44,600
Get in there.
Go on.

1123
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:48,000
- Get in. You get back in there!

1124
01:39:48,100 --> 01:39:50,800
<i>You get this train
movin'! Go on!</i>

1125
01:39:50,900 --> 01:39:54,600
- Are these seats taken?
- No. No.

1126
01:39:54,700 --> 01:39:57,500
<i>All aboard. Doors will be closing. </i>

1127
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:00,600
Come on! Back over here!
Hands around the pole.

1128
01:40:00,700 --> 01:40:03,200
<i>All aboard.
Doors will be closing. </i>

1129
01:40:22,810 --> 01:40:24,710
Damn.

1130
01:40:43,310 --> 01:40:46,210
<i>Come on, come on,
come on!</i>

1131
01:40:51,210 --> 01:40:54,310
<i> Please report,
westbound 501. What is your position?</i>

1132
01:40:59,310 --> 01:41:01,410
<i>Westbound 501,
please check in. </i>

1133
01:41:01,510 --> 01:41:04,510
- You see? You're beginning to see how it works, huh?
- Westbound 501.

1134
01:41:04,610 --> 01:41:08,810
<i>You have police orders to return to the
station, westbound 501. Do you copy?</i>

1135
01:41:08,910 --> 01:41:12,710
You have to hold this. It's like
a grenade. You have to help me now.

1136
01:41:12,810 --> 01:41:15,110
Come on, hold it.
Don't let it go.

1137
01:41:15,210 --> 01:41:19,010
<i>- Huh? Counting on you.
- Do you copy?</i>

1138
01:41:19,110 --> 01:41:21,810
Hey! I'll take it
from here.

1139
01:41:21,910 --> 01:41:24,120
No!

1140
01:41:27,020 --> 01:41:30,320
<i>No! No! No! No. </i>

1141
01:41:30,420 --> 01:41:33,720
- Ho! Uh-oh! Wait, wait.
- No. No. No.

1142
01:41:33,820 --> 01:41:36,520
Maybe you'd better let me
have this after all.

1143
01:41:36,620 --> 01:41:41,220
I'm afraid you're a bit hysterical,
and you might let this go a mite early.

1144
01:41:44,020 --> 01:41:49,520
Hey. Hey, buckaroo. It's not
'cause you're a woman, all right?

1145
01:41:49,620 --> 01:41:54,020
<i>Hey, it's all right.
Looks like we're all alone. </i>

1146
01:41:54,120 --> 01:41:56,520
Look, you won. You beat Jack.
You beat everybody.

1147
01:41:56,620 --> 01:41:59,220
<i>Just throw me off the train.
I don't care. Okay?</i>

1148
01:41:59,320 --> 01:42:02,720
This stick, huh,
works on a remote.

1149
01:42:02,820 --> 01:42:04,920
- When you explode,
- Yeah.

1150
01:42:05,020 --> 01:42:07,520
That's where they'll come,
but that's not where I'll be.

1151
01:42:07,620 --> 01:42:12,320
I have a different plan. Mess like that,
they don't even count body parts.

1152
01:42:13,420 --> 01:42:16,620
Gives me more time.

1153
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:19,720
It's not gonna hurt, Annie.

1154
01:42:30,820 --> 01:42:33,420
Hey, Jack! Is that you?

1155
01:42:36,830 --> 01:42:40,030
He is so persistent.
He always gets his man.

1156
01:42:40,130 --> 01:42:43,930
Wouldn't be able to interest
you in a bribe, would I?

1157
01:42:44,030 --> 01:42:47,730
I've got, uh,
plenty to go around!

1158
01:42:51,630 --> 01:42:53,530
<i>My money!</i>

1159
01:42:58,230 --> 01:43:01,930
You bastard!
How does that feel?

1160
01:43:04,030 --> 01:43:07,630
You like that, huh?
You like it, you bastard?

1161
01:43:11,930 --> 01:43:13,830
My money!

1162
01:43:20,230 --> 01:43:23,630
Shit. You!

1163
01:43:23,730 --> 01:43:26,530
I'm comin' for you, Jack!

1164
01:43:55,640 --> 01:43:58,640
Hey, I'll drop this stick, boy.
You want that?

1165
01:43:58,740 --> 01:44:01,340
Huh? I'll get you.
I'm gonna get you.

1166
01:44:03,040 --> 01:44:05,940
Oh, yes! Yahoo!

1167
01:44:06,040 --> 01:44:07,940
You...

1168
01:44:09,340 --> 01:44:11,440
Yes!

1169
01:44:16,840 --> 01:44:20,040
What do you do, Jack, huh?
What do you do?

1170
01:44:20,140 --> 01:44:23,440
You're so smart. Right, Jack?
You piece of shit.

1171
01:44:23,540 --> 01:44:26,540
I'm the guy with the plan
'cause I'm smarter than you.

1172
01:44:26,640 --> 01:44:30,140
<i>I'm smarter than you. </i>

1173
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:32,140
You... You...

1174
01:44:43,240 --> 01:44:45,740
Yeah?

1175
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:47,840
Well, I'm taller.

1176
01:44:49,240 --> 01:44:52,540
Jack? Jack!

1177
01:44:52,640 --> 01:44:56,240
<i>Oh, God, I thought
you were dead. Jack. </i>

1178
01:44:56,340 --> 01:44:59,750
- Turn around.
- Where's Payne?

1179
01:44:59,850 --> 01:45:02,850
He lost his head.

1180
01:45:05,250 --> 01:45:07,550
Oh, God.

1181
01:45:07,650 --> 01:45:10,750
- Let's take this off, shall we?
- Yes, let's take this off.

1182
01:45:14,250 --> 01:45:17,450
<i>- Take it off.
- Hello? Hello?</i>

1183
01:45:17,550 --> 01:45:20,950
<i>- Come in. Copy.
Jack, this is Mac. </i>

1184
01:45:21,050 --> 01:45:26,150
<i>Do you hear me? Jack, if you're there,
you got to stop the train. </i>

1185
01:45:26,250 --> 01:45:29,950
<i>- The track isn't finished.
I repeat, the track...  - Mac, I copy.</i>

1186
01:45:30,050 --> 01:45:31,950
<i>Mac. </i>

1187
01:45:32,050 --> 01:45:34,050
- Do you copy?
- Mac.

1188
01:45:34,150 --> 01:45:37,550
- Mac, can you hear me?
- Try the emergency brake.

1189
01:45:37,650 --> 01:45:40,450
<i>Jack, do you copy?</i>

1190
01:45:40,550 --> 01:45:42,550
<i>Jack, can you... </i>

1191
01:45:42,650 --> 01:45:45,550
Nothing works! Annie,
you won't believe this.

1192
01:45:45,650 --> 01:45:48,150
<i>- Jack, this track can't...
- What?</i>

1193
01:45:48,350 --> 01:45:51,450
- We have to jump.
- You can't stop it?

1194
01:45:54,150 --> 01:45:59,650
Well, um... Okay, well, undo me and I'd
love to go with you. Come on. Please.

1195
01:46:01,250 --> 01:46:03,450
- I don't have the key.
- What?

1196
01:46:03,550 --> 01:46:05,650
I don't have the key.

1197
01:46:26,060 --> 01:46:30,760
Shit.

1198
01:46:30,860 --> 01:46:32,960
Ow!

1199
01:46:44,860 --> 01:46:48,860
You gotta get off the... You gotta
get off the train. Jack, please!

1200
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:52,660
<i>This track dead-ends, Jack. You gotta
get off this train. This is crazy. </i>

1201
01:46:52,860 --> 01:46:55,960
<i>There's a curve ahead.
I'm gonna speed it up,</i>

1202
01:46:56,060 --> 01:46:58,460
make it jump the track.

1203
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:02,060
This is really stupid. Jack.
Jack, please. You can still jump.

1204
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:04,760
<i>Jack, please. Please!</i>

1205
01:47:04,860 --> 01:47:07,460
<i>Jack. </i>

1206
01:48:24,170 --> 01:48:26,570
Holy shit!

1207
01:49:45,490 --> 01:49:49,690
I can't believe he hit my van.
No, it's all right.

1208
01:49:49,790 --> 01:49:51,690
Unreal.

1209
01:49:54,390 --> 01:49:57,790
You didn't leave me.
I can't believe it.

1210
01:50:01,090 --> 01:50:03,590
You didn't leave me.

1211
01:50:03,690 --> 01:50:06,190
Didn't have anywhere
to be just then.

1212
01:50:11,490 --> 01:50:13,390
Check it out.

1213
01:50:19,690 --> 01:50:21,590
I have to warn you,

1214
01:50:21,690 --> 01:50:25,690
I've heard relationships based
on intense experiences never work.

1215
01:50:25,790 --> 01:50:27,690
Okay.

1216
01:50:29,090 --> 01:50:32,190
We'll have to base it
on sex then.

1217
01:50:32,290 --> 01:50:35,490
Whatever you say, ma'am.

1218
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,400
That's so romantic.
