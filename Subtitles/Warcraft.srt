2
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,430
There has been a war between orcs and humans

3
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,490
for as long as can be remembered.

4
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,310
But there was once a time,

5
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,950
when we did not even know who our enemy was.

6
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,140
Or what that evil green magic, the fel,

7
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,380
had done to us.

8
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,570
But in the beginning, how could we have known.

9
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,060
What choice did we have?

10
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,950
Our world was dying.

11
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,070
And I had to find my clan a new home.

12
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:16,820
Durotan.

13
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,810
I can feel your eyes.

14
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,550
I thought you were asleep.

15
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,750
I was.

16
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,920
Dreaming of a hunt, through the snow.

17
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,300
I thought of a name.

18
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,250
Well. Keep it to yourself, wife.

19
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,770
I'll choose a name when I meet him.

20
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,730
Or her.

21
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:00,340
And how will the great Durotan name his son?

22
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,670
If I do not travel with him.

23
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,100
A son?

24
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,840
Can you hide your fat belly?

25
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,990
Better than you can hide your fat head.

26
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,700
So many clans in one place, Orgrim.

27
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,940
Laughingskull. Blackrock.

28
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,030
All have been summoned.

29
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,270
It will be a mighty warband.

30
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,410
I just wonder who's left to fight?

31
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,650
Lok'tar ogar!

32
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,890
Victory or death!

33
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,510
Blackrock, over there.

34
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,210
How much longer, Blackhand?

35
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,680
We are ready, Gul'dan.

36
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,450
Help me.

37
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,210
My child. Please let him go.

38
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,870
I beg you.

39
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,490
What did she say?

40
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,160
She begs for you to free her child.

41
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,190
But I need him. I need all of them.

42
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,690
Move, half breed.

43
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:07,810
- What is that?
- Gul'dan's magic.

44
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:24,260
The fuel of my magic is life.

45
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,500
We only have enough prisoners

46
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,350
to send through our strongest warriors.

47
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:35,140
But that will be enough. The enemy is weak.

48
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:40,590
When we arrive, we will take them as fuel.

49
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:49,130
We will build a new portal. And when it is complete,

50
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:54,460
we will bring through all... of the Horde.

51
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,860
Let me go first.

52
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,650
For the Horde!

53
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,450
With child?

54
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:02,550
You dare bring that burden into my warband!

55
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,420
Let me go, Blackhand. Draka!

56
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,420
Push, little one. Push.

57
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,640
My son.

58
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,310
A new warrior for the Horde.

59
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:38,910
Lothar, come. I have got something for you.

60
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,350
- What is it?
- A mechanical marvel.

61
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,060
It's a boomstick.

62
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,680
Odd.

63
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,480
Take water.

64
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,690
You might want to head home, big man.

65
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,590
Someone has attacked one of your garrisons.

66
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:22,000
It seems your king needs you, commander.

67
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:39,340
The entire garrison, and no one saw anything.

68
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,090
We did find someone.

69
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,490
He was searching the bodies, here, in the barracks.

70
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,060
In the barracks?

71
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,140
Finally. Are you in command?

72
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,320
That's the mark of the Kirin Tor.

73
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,680
What are you doing in my city, spell chucker?

74
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,220
Let me complete my examination of the body across the hall.

75
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,250
Now why would I do that?

76
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,530
Within that body is the secret to your attacks.

77
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,960
What was that?

78
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,280
You must summon the Guardian.

79
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,740
Medivh?

80
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,940
It should be he who explains it.

81
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,240
Only the king summons the Guardian.

82
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:58,850
Get him to Goldshire.

83
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,810
- What kind of beasts?
- Rumors, your Majesty.

84
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:29,480
How does a garrison of 30 men disappear without a whisper.

85
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,420
The fel.

86
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,870
Or at least its influence.

87
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,010
Is this him?

88
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:40,880
Your Majesty.

89
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:43,930
Dad.

90
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,800
Thank you, son.

91
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,940
So who are you, mage?

92
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,870
My name is Khadgar. I'm a Guardian novitiate.

93
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,420
I was. I renounced my vows.

94
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,920
You mean you're a fugitive?

95
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,350
I'm not hiding.

96
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:00,710
Your Majesty.

97
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,630
I may have left my training

98
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,650
but I didn't leave my abilities behind.

99
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,120
I senses something.

100
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,670
Dark forces, when it's strong it...

101
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,250
almost has a smell.

102
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,240
Knowing that something so evil was so close

103
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,760
I couldn't just ignore it.

104
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,310
What's going on out there?

105
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,680
Smoke, Sir. The southeast.

106
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:26,310
Your Majesty, I urge you to engage the Guardian with all haste.

107
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,750
They've reached Elwynn Forest.

108
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,260
The Grand Hamlet is burning.

109
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:33,760
An attack?

110
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,680
- What?
- Stop requesting Callan.

111
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:41,800
Stay out of my business.

112
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,920
He wants to follow in his father's footsteps.

113
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,570
My son doesn't need your help.

114
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,630
Tread carefully when you talk to your queen.

115
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,970
You are my sister first.

116
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,280
When was your last visit to Karazhan?

117
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,310
With you. I don't know... 6 years?

118
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,420
And you had no contact with Medivh since?

119
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,890
Not for the lack of trying.

120
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,020
He can't hide from us now.

121
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,820
The Guardian is summoned.

122
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,790
Get on.

123
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,560
Good luck.

124
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,000
Okay.

125
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,900
Let me go!

126
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,560
Frostwolves do not join the hunt?

127
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,430
We prefer our enemies armed with an axe, not a child.

128
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,610
We have been commanded, Durotan.

129
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,630
Respect the old ways.

130
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,260
There must be a worthy foe somewhere on this dung heap.

131
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,370
Find them all!

132
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,680
Try not to kill too many, we need them alive.

133
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,710
Lothar.

134
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,510
Moroes.

135
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:24,930
Look at you. You haven't aged a bit.

136
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,140
Where is everyone?

137
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,070
Many things have changed.

138
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,020
The power that must be locked away here, the knowledge.

139
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:40,990
Where is he?

140
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:44,700
I didn't know so many books even existed.

141
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,360
Wait here.

142
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,460
And try not to touch anything.

143
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,960
- He sees no one?
- The world's been at peace.

144
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,730
Good you are here, Lothar.

145
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,730
It would do the Guardian a world of good

146
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:03,400
to see a friendly face beyond this old one.

147
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,640
He can't refuse you... nor King Wrynn.

148
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,030
Not if he's summoned.

149
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,480
Chop chop.

150
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,520
Did you summon him, Moroes?

151
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,010
No. He did not.

152
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:01,480
So. You become a sculptor?

153
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,770
I'm making a golem.

154
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:06,060
It usually takes years of

155
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,850
magic to sip into the clay, but up here it's...

156
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:10,700
much faster.

157
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,240
Makes someone to keep Moroes company.

158
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,960
Help to clean up around the house.

159
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,090
Thank you.

160
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,980
It's good to see you, Lothar.

161
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,020
We need your guidance, Medivh.

162
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,360
Our king summons you.

163
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,750
Who's the boy downstairs?

164
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,320
Hello?

165
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,460
Guardian?

166
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,510
Have a good look around?

167
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:50,200
Getting some ideas what you

168
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,140
are going to do with the place once it's yours?

169
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,160
Guardian, I've renounced my vow.

170
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:01,360
I didn't want to come here. I swear, Guardian.

171
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,930
I urged them to find you. I told them...

172
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,810
you should be the one to explain.

173
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,310
Explain what?

174
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:08,410
Fel!

175
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,020
In Azeroth?

176
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,680
In the barracks, one of the bodies.

177
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,810
Guardian, what is the fel?

178
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:25,160
A magic unlike any other. It feeds on life itself.

179
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,740
It pollutes the user, twisting everything it touches.

180
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:32,810
It promises great power but it exacts a terrible price.

181
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,180
There is no place for the fel in Azeroth.

182
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,640
You've done the right thing.

183
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:42,610
We'll go.

184
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,360
Hey. Go home, you.

185
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,680
Step in.

186
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:27,400
- Medivh.
- Your Grace.

187
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,120
It has been too long.

188
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,120
Come.

189
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,900
Help us get to the roots of these troubles about.

190
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,820
- What kind of beasts?
- They are saying giants.

191
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:46,390
Armed giants. Wolves to carry them.

192
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,060
Huge unstoppable monsters.

193
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:51,450
What are the other kingdoms? Are they suffering the same?

194
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,560
All seek our protection

195
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,130
yet not trust us enough to tell us anything.

196
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:58,460
We know nothing about these so call monsters.

197
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,130
We need prisoners.

198
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,680
Even a corpse can tell us something.

199
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,850
I don't know what danger we're in, Medivh.

200
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,890
I exist to protect this realm, my lord.

201
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,400
It is my very purpose.

202
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,320
I am the Guardian.

203
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,830
At least for the time being anyhow.

204
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,370
Yes.

205
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,290
What are we going to do about... What is his name?

206
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,320
Khadgar, sire.

207
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,730
He'll be coming with us.

208
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,110
Well then.

209
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,710
We better get going.

210
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,990
Halt!

211
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,280
It can't be.

212
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:44,170
- What is this?
- Can't tell from the look of it.

213
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:48,220
Guardian.

214
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,210
Close ranks!

215
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:52,900
Watch your back!

216
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:56,200
Victory or death!

217
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:04,760
Watch the flank to your left!

218
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:15,070
Watch your flank!

219
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,860
- Watch your flank!
- To your left!

220
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,750
Guardian!

221
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:49,890
Now you die, you beast!

222
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,590
Don't try and take them on with brute force.

223
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:04,270
They are stronger. Be smarter.

224
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,400
The fel.

225
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,380
They're all dying.

226
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,580
Only the green ones!

227
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,770
Kill that big bastard!

228
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:01,690
Durotan. Move.

229
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,550
Guardian. Guardian, what did you do?

230
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,980
I was right, wasn't I? It's here.

231
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,070
Where are you going?

232
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:22,480
Get these men safely back to Stormwind.

233
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,760
I've to return to Karazhan.

234
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:27,590
You did well today.

235
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,660
- Where's the Guardian?
- Karazhan.

236
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,790
We need a prisoner. Where's your horse?

237
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,920
- Uh. They took my horse.
- Really?

238
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,100
Just stay there.

239
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,750
How much do you love your master?

240
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,460
I'll do it.

241
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:31,880
Back off!

242
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:40,280
Pity. It would have make a good coat.

243
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:58,400
Over here!

244
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:10,920
- You took it alone.
- Yes.

245
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,170
Looks like the runt to the litter.

246
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,760
You. What are you?

247
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:32,270
And why do you attack our lands?

248
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,420
He does not know what you speak.

249
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,830
You speak our language?

250
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:40,050
Speak one more word in their language.

251
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:43,590
And I will wear your tongue.

252
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,270
I will not warn you again.

253
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,930
- Tell him to stop.
- You tell him.

254
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:12,620
You're welcome.

255
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:18,130
Have you a name?

256
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,270
You understand our language.

257
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,880
Again, have you a name?

258
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:36,220
Garona.

259
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:39,650
She calls herself, Garona.

260
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:43,340
What kind of being are you?

261
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:46,710
She seems more like us than those... beast we fought.

262
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,980
Orc.

263
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,440
Orc?

264
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:52,840
That's what you are? Or the beast in the cage was?

265
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,650
I know every races in the Seven Kingdoms.

266
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:58,700
I've never heard of orc.

267
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,130
Show me where you come from.

268
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:10,860
This is not orc world.

269
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,170
Orc world is dead.

270
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:15,730
Orcs take this world now.

271
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,970
Not from this world.

272
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:20,480
How did you get here?

273
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,360
The great gate.

274
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:26,290
Deep in ground and through magic brought us here.

275
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,790
But how did you learn our language?

276
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:30,580
Orc take prisoner for the gate.

277
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,610
- I learn from them.
- Prisoners?

278
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,090
Our people? Are they alive?

279
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,380
Yes.

280
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,250
- Many.
- Why?

281
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:41,150
To feed the gate.

282
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:44,410
To bring the Horde to take your world.

283
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,210
You'll take us to them.

284
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:48,150
No.

285
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,960
You'll take us to them,

286
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:53,180
or you will end up like your friend in the cage.

287
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,460
You think you are fearsome.

288
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:02,850
Orc children have pets more fearsome than you.

289
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:05,450
We're not trying to be fearsome, Garona.

290
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:08,910
We are trying to protect our people, our families.

291
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:12,360
If you help us. I give you my oath.

292
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,530
You will have your freedom.

293
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,770
Fearsome Blackhand.

294
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:25,230
Warchief of the Horde.

295
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:31,020
You have allowed the smallteeths to kill your warriors.

296
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,520
Worse.

297
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:36,660
You shamed your people by running from an enemy.

298
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:41,500
Are you too weak to talk, destroyer?

299
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,020
The Horde has no use for weakness.

300
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,420
Respect our tradition, warchief.

301
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:54,120
You know the penalty.

302
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,580
Death.

303
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:16,350
Done.

304
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:24,230
- You dare interrupt this judgment?
- We fought hard!

305
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:27,770
Their warlock use your fel against us.

306
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:30,690
Only I can control the fel!

307
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:38,170
I see you and your men have survived.

308
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:43,190
Perhaps Blackhand kept you safely away from the battlefield.

309
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:46,870
Maybe he knows you are weak too.

310
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:52,720
Do you wish to challenge me, little chieftain.

311
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:59,360
I do not question, Gul'dan.

312
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:04,200
But the fel is born of death, must have a price.

313
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:08,910
A price paid in lives taken.

314
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:23,310
Will you hold your son?

315
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,400
He will be a great chieftain.

316
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:45,220
Like his father, a born leader.

317
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,770
I was no leader today.

318
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,090
He challenges you already.

319
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,920
If Gul'dan can infect born as innocent as he,

320
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:05,790
what chance do the rest of us have?

321
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,610
Whatever happens.

322
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,820
Whatever happens.

323
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:28,770
I see you.

324
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:34,050
This gate, who showed it to Gul'dan?

325
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:36,740
Who lead him to Azeroth?

326
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:39,330
Gul'dan call him a demon.

327
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:41,080
Did you see it?

328
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:44,890
Not the face, but the voice...

329
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:47,550
Like fire and ash.

330
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:05,750
I'll be here if you need me.

331
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,510
Your mate.

332
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:26,300
I could kill you before he even reaches me.

333
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,550
Lothar?

334
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,580
He is my brother.

335
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:36,530
The king is my mate.

336
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,690
You are the chieftain's wife then?

337
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,680
I suppose so.

338
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,790
Then killing you will bring me even greater honor.

339
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:47,690
Not among my kind.

340
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,800
It is a cold night.

341
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:53,310
I thought you might use these.

342
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,480
It will warm you.

343
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,840
More of our villages burned tonight.

344
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:21,320
One of them is the village of my birth.

345
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:27,550
I can not imagine what horrors you have been through, Garona.

346
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,900
But this does not need to happen.

347
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:34,310
We have peace in these lands for many years now.

348
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:37,580
Peace between races from all over the world.

349
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:45,000
What is this?

350
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,480
I can have it removed.

351
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:56,620
There is a life here for you, Garona.

352
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:00,720
With us. A life of freedom.

353
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:03,590
If you want it.

354
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,780
The great gate.

355
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:31,250
From light comes darkness and from darkness, light.

356
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:33,190
Well, that's clear.

357
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,650
Ask Alodi.

358
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,530
Alodi.

359
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:54,340
It's good to see trees again.

360
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,820
And the snow.

361
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:59,160
Even from a distance.

362
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,530
Remember when we would

363
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:04,680
track blood ox through the Frostwind dunes?

364
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:08,750
There was always meat. Always life.

365
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,960
You don't think it's strange

366
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:14,060
that we lost our home when Gul'dan came to power.

367
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,590
One orc could not kill a world, Durotan.

368
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:18,390
Are you sure?

369
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:23,080
Look around you. Does it not remind you of something?

370
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:29,210
Wherever Gul'dan works his magic, the land dies.

371
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:34,380
If our people are to make a home here, my friend.

372
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:38,900
Gul'dan must be stopped.

373
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:43,600
We are not powerful enough to defeat Gul'dan.

374
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,970
No.

375
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,980
No.

376
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:55,920
But with the humans help, we could be.

377
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:11,730
I want that weapon.

378
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:17,330
You'll have me to protect you.

379
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,630
I need no one to protect me.

380
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,600
What are you looking at?

381
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:08,210
Bookworm. Take the first watch.

382
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,000
Respectfully, Commander, my name is Khadgar.

383
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:13,740
My deepest apologies, Khadgar.

384
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:15,730
You see, I thought we bonded when

385
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:16,800
I didn't put you in a

386
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,040
prison cell for breaking into royal barracks.

387
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:21,840
Now take the watch.

388
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:39,170
Well. At least you're not reading.

389
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,660
He wishes to lie with me.

390
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,640
I beg your pardon?

391
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:51,360
You will be injured.

392
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:54,280
- I don't want to lie with you.
- Good.

393
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,580
You would not be an effective mate.

394
00:41:57,410 --> 00:41:59,100
Why do you laugh?

395
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:02,740
I can't see how you humans survive such a thing.

396
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:06,430
No muscles to protect you. Brittle bones that break.

397
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,520
You don't look that different to us.

398
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:10,930
How did you survive?

399
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,500
Broken bones heal stronger.

400
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,410
Mine are very strong.

401
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:21,810
I'm sorry.

402
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:23,410
Do not be.

403
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,360
My name, Garona,

404
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,810
it means "Cursed" in Orc.

405
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,270
My mother was burned alive for giving birth to me.

406
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,760
They kept you alive though.

407
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:52,270
Gul'dan did.

408
00:42:55,500 --> 00:43:00,420
He gave me her tusk to remember her.

409
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:12,320
My parents gave me to the Kirin Tor when I was 6 years old.

410
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:16,770
That's the last time I saw them or...

411
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:19,870
any of my brothers and sisters.

412
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:26,550
It brings a family honor to offer a child to the Kirin Tor.

413
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:30,350
To have their son taken up to the floating city of Dalaran

414
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:33,660
and be trained by the most powerful mages in the land.

415
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,090
Less so, to have them run away.

416
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:46,740
Well. That was cheerful.

417
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:51,410
The great gate.

418
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:57,070
Why do they need so many prisoners?

419
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:59,540
Like wood for a fire.

420
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,410
Green magic takes life to open the gate.

421
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:05,850
How many more orcs are they planning on bringing?

422
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:08,880
All of them. This is just a warband.

423
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:13,700
When the portal is open, Gul'dan will bring the Horde.

424
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:23,130
Get them back to Stormwind.

425
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,370
We ride ahead.

426
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:38,680
Garona, we should go. It's not safe...

427
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:41,440
Durotan.

428
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:45,560
To the north, there is a black rock that touches the sky.

429
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:48,350
I would meet with their leader.

430
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,080
To challenge him?

431
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:53,760
I saw you, lead the smallteeths to our encampment.

432
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:56,010
They have seen what is being built.

433
00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:00,920
But only you know, what Gul'dan has planned for my people.

434
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:05,350
His magic is death to all things.

435
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:09,030
He must be stopped.

436
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:15,900
Tell him, the black rock, when the sun is highest.

437
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:17,300
I will.

438
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:20,510
Chieftain.

439
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:25,490
If I return, would you take me into your clan?

440
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,350
You're safer here, with them.

441
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:25,140
Is it as you feared?

442
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:29,850
- The fel is everywhere.
- Then you mustn't leave again.

443
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:34,770
They need the Guardian's help now more than ever.

444
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,160
Maybe the boy can help.

445
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,660
- We need solution!
- Easy for you to say!

446
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:49,240
The Dwarf enforgers must work overtime.

447
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,840
You treat us no better than dogs.

448
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,810
- We shall supply you no more!
- Enough!

449
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:57,840
You have all called on Stormwind

450
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:00,550
in the past either for troops or arbitration.

451
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:07,270
If we do not unite to fight this enemy, we will perish.

452
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:11,080
Stormwind needs soldiers, arms, horses...

453
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:13,450
Ha! We have our own kingdoms to look after.

454
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:15,470
- Fight your own wars!
- Your Majesty.

455
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:17,690
Commander.

456
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:19,380
The orcs are building a portal,

457
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:21,340
through which they plan to bring an army.

458
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:25,270
If we do not stop them now, we may never get another opportunity.

459
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:29,670
Where is he? Where is the protector of Azeroth?

460
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:31,040
Where the Guardian?

461
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,510
Where is Medivh?

462
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:35,140
- My liege.
- I suggest we take a recess.

463
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:38,490
Take as long as you like. We're done.

464
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:43,850
Commander.

465
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:47,170
What's left of the 4th has retreated from Stonewatch.

466
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:48,420
What's left?

467
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:51,030
Callan is among the injured.

468
00:47:58,140 --> 00:47:59,110
Dad?

469
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,840
I'm fine. It's fine.

470
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,570
You had me worried.

471
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,480
Where's the rest of your troop?

472
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:19,680
They took most of them alive.

473
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:22,150
We'll get them back.

474
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:25,340
Don't be in such a hurry.

475
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,570
You're all I have.

476
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:38,020
I know. I'm a soldier.

477
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:49,140
He would not ask for this meeting

478
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:51,750
if he thought he could defeat Gul'dan alone.

479
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:55,810
The fel must truly terrified him.

480
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:57,400
Durotan is scared of nothing.

481
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,430
The location.

482
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:02,740
The suddenness of this meeting.

483
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:06,520
- Sounds like a trap.
- It is not.

484
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,030
- Could be.
- It is not.

485
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,730
- Could be.
- It is not.

486
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,160
What do you think?

487
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,150
It's too good an opportunity to ignore.

488
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:15,930
I think we have no choice.

489
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:19,980
We must stop the orcs from opening the portal.

490
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:22,800
But we will need help.

491
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:25,630
- And if he's lying?
- Orcs do not lie.

492
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:27,960
- What if he is?
- There is no honor in it.

493
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:30,850
And where's the 'honor' in him betraying his own people?

494
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:34,910
Durotan is protecting his clan. His enemy is the fel.

495
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,980
Gul'dan is the betrayer.

496
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:41,140
This orc, Durotan. How do you know him?

497
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:44,350
He freed me, and he is loved by his clan.

498
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:47,000
He's a strong chieftain.

499
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:50,130
Strong chiefs must earn their clans trust.

500
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:53,550
If we are to expect you to join us.

501
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:56,780
We must earn yours.

502
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:07,200
To defend yourself.

503
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:10,150
With this?

504
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,320
Yes.

505
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:15,010
Find the Guardian.

506
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:19,270
What is this?

507
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:21,650
Guardian?

508
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,550
The gate. We saw it, in the morass.

509
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:31,170
I've been putting together all the clues I can about it.

510
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:33,920
This. This drawing.

511
00:50:34,350 --> 00:50:36,550
- Where did you copy it from?
- Guardian.

512
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:37,950
And this?

513
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:43,800
And this? And this?

514
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,690
I've been researching ever since I felt the presence of the fel.

515
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:50,600
I am the Guardian. Me, not you.

516
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:52,520
Not yet.

517
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:55,120
I just thought you might appreciate some help.

518
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:07,130
Don't presume you can help me.

519
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:12,620
You have no idea the forces I contend with.

520
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:18,890
If you want to help, protect the king.

521
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,820
You leave the fel to me.

522
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:36,340
- Interesting choice.
- Guardian.

523
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:42,590
Pack up and move to the west gate.

524
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:48,770
You there.

525
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:51,040
Pack up your stall and get moving now!

526
00:51:57,730 --> 00:51:58,970
I need your help.

527
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:01,260
- I found a book.
- Of course you did.

528
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:02,980
There was an illustration that showed the gate

529
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:04,740
like the one we saw being built.

530
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,580
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Khadgar.

531
00:52:09,570 --> 00:52:12,150
Listen. I tried to show the Guardian but he became furious.

532
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:13,950
He burned all my research.

533
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:16,780
He would have burn this too If I hadn't hidden it in my robe.

534
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:25,830
No, turn the page. Here.

535
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:27,900
Look.

536
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:29,250
See.

537
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:34,440
What do you think the image means?

538
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:35,960
The orcs were summoned.

539
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:38,900
From this side of the gate. They were invited in.

540
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:46,290
And the Guardian burned your research.

541
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:51,330
He's probably just trying to protect you.

542
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,630
Now go away.

543
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:14,100
Good spot for an ambush.

544
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,690
Our sentries are well placed.

545
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:22,230
I will check again.

546
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:22,490
You asked to speak with the humanking.

547
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:24,010
Here he stands.

548
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,540
I am the King Llane.

549
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:31,380
I'm told you wished to talk.

550
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,200
Ask him if they plan to return to their home?

551
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,350
Our world is destroyed.

552
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:54,930
There is nothing to go back to.

553
00:54:54,930 --> 00:54:57,750
We are not responsible for destroying your world.

554
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:00,890
War with us will solve nothing.

555
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:11,190
He says, "Orcs, war solves everything."

556
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,170
Then why is he here?

557
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:20,650
To save my people.

558
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:25,340
Fel takes life from more than it's victims.

559
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:30,140
Kills the earth and corrupts those who use it.

560
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:34,960
Gul'dan will poison everything with his death magic.

561
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:40,580
If my people are to survive, Gul'dan must be destroyed.

562
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:47,110
In 2 suns, the humans we have captured...

563
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:51,160
be used to fuel the portal.

564
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:56,140
If you attack our camp, and draw his warriors away,

565
00:55:58,190 --> 00:56:01,570
Frostwolf clan, will kill him.

566
00:56:03,930 --> 00:56:05,350
Two days.

567
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:12,680
If we do this, you will protect my people until then.

568
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:17,470
I will try.

569
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:23,430
It's a trap!

570
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,000
Traitor die!

571
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:29,900
Retreat!

572
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:32,780
Back! Return to our camp!

573
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,160
Fall back!

574
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:04,960
Stay together!

575
00:57:09,570 --> 00:57:11,650
Focus. Like old times.

576
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,460
Cover your flank!

577
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,100
Spread out!

578
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:37,340
Swords!

579
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:53,270
You alright?

580
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:58,240
You are no good to us dead. Go.

581
00:57:58,270 --> 00:57:59,720
I'll get the others.

582
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:02,040
Fall back!

583
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:03,200
We're all getting out.

584
00:58:03,890 --> 00:58:05,750
Medivh will cover our retreat.

585
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:07,540
Fall back!

586
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:20,500
Garona!

587
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:24,260
Stay together!

588
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:29,560
Fall back!

589
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:33,360
Go on, now!

590
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:35,810
Where's the bloody Guardian?

591
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:44,130
Protect the king. I got them.

592
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:45,890
Move back!

593
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:04,050
Shield Formation!

594
00:59:52,970 --> 00:59:54,850
Retreat to the plateau.

595
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:56,870
Fall back!

596
00:59:57,110 --> 00:59:59,390
Up the hill. Move!

597
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:19,670
Medivh.

598
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:25,940
Medivh, take it down!

599
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,250
Medivh!

600
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:46,930
Hold on, son.

601
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:50,670
Dad.

602
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:54,760
For Azeroth.

603
01:00:56,150 --> 01:00:57,440
Medivh!

604
01:01:31,790 --> 01:01:33,070
Stop.

605
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:37,910
No.

606
01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:40,200
Callan.

607
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:50,410
He's here!

608
01:02:54,930 --> 01:02:55,980
What's wrong with him?

609
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,400
We need to get him to Karazhan.

610
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,600
- I'll get the horses.
- You won't make any time by road.

611
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,400
Take one of my birds.

612
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:12,200
Place him in the font.

613
01:03:14,910 --> 01:03:16,080
Moroes, what's wrong with him?

614
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:18,330
I told him not to leave Karazhan.

615
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:34,970
I have to go.

616
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:38,860
We need the help of the Kirin Tor, now.

617
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:39,710
Go.

618
01:03:39,710 --> 01:03:42,120
There are medicines I must prepare. Sit with him.

619
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:48,990
You and the baby must leave now.

620
01:03:51,690 --> 01:03:53,740
You're a traitor, Durotan.

621
01:03:55,050 --> 01:03:56,080
No.

622
01:03:56,520 --> 01:04:00,270
One who values what we once were. Like you used to.

623
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:01,890
That time is past.

624
01:04:01,890 --> 01:04:04,780
We are but fuel for the fel now.

625
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:06,740
There is still hope, Blackhand.

626
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:08,120
Our children.

627
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:22,620
Do not make me take more innocent lives, young chieftain.

628
01:04:26,310 --> 01:04:27,680
If I submit...

629
01:04:29,770 --> 01:04:31,710
will you let my people be?

630
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:43,860
What will I call our son?

631
01:04:49,370 --> 01:04:50,420
Go'el.

632
01:05:07,030 --> 01:05:08,150
You.

633
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:10,050
Where's the old man?

634
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,570
He told me to watch you.

635
01:05:15,110 --> 01:05:17,210
- The king.
- He is alive.

636
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,090
Lothar's son is dead.

637
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:28,440
I argued for the meeting.

638
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:32,290
Lothar will hate me.

639
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:34,450
This upsets you.

640
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:39,530
He is a great warrior.

641
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:43,070
He defends his people well.

642
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,370
A good mate for an orc.

643
01:05:46,870 --> 01:05:48,110
I am no orc.

644
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,490
I am no human either.

645
01:05:55,970 --> 01:06:00,520
When I was younger, I used to feel apart from my kin.

646
01:06:01,370 --> 01:06:08,340
I traveled far and wide, looking for... wisdom.

647
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:09,900
Feel a connection with

648
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:13,490
all the souls I was charged with protecting.

649
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:18,930
On my travel, I met a strong and noble people.

650
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:25,240
Among them, a female, who accepted me for what I was.

651
01:06:25,850 --> 01:06:27,170
Who loved me.

652
01:06:30,410 --> 01:06:33,530
It was not a life I was fated to have,

653
01:06:33,540 --> 01:06:35,050
but it taught me something.

654
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:38,210
If love is what you need,

655
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:43,270
you must be willing to travel to the end the world to find it.

656
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:50,920
You left your mate.

657
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:52,750
Go find Lothar.

658
01:07:14,850 --> 01:07:16,570
Step inside the circle.

659
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:31,770
This... is my gift to you, Garona.

660
01:08:02,010 --> 01:08:04,510
A whole world and exchange for a statue.

661
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,950
Gods are strange creatures.

662
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:15,610
Frostwolves, you are a practical people.

663
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:19,860
Those of us from the south have always admired that about you.

664
01:08:26,230 --> 01:08:31,050
When the portal opens, when the rest of the Horde join us

665
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:33,780
we will give them the fel.

666
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:37,540
- All of them.
- Durotan did not agree to this!

667
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:40,620
And why would you care what that traitor thinks?

668
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:44,810
It is time for a new leader of the Frostwolf clan.

669
01:08:45,190 --> 01:08:48,160
One who has the best interest of his orcs in mind,

670
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:51,710
One who appreciates Gul'dan's vision,

671
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,490
his power.

672
01:08:57,830 --> 01:08:58,870
Come.

673
01:09:00,070 --> 01:09:02,130
I will grant you the fel.

674
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:09,150
Durotan, he... has poisoned the Frostwolves against the fel.

675
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:13,420
Let me gather them, bring them here.

676
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:17,580
Grant me the fel in front of them, let them see...

677
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:19,970
How much stronger I become.

678
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:25,510
As I said, a practical people.

679
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:28,930
This is a new dawn.

680
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:31,760
The time of the Horde.

681
01:09:32,670 --> 01:09:36,980
Be feared, or be fuel.

682
01:09:50,370 --> 01:09:51,680
I'm sorry.

683
01:09:54,410 --> 01:09:55,520
Callan's mother,

684
01:09:57,970 --> 01:10:00,010
died in childbirth.

685
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,170
I blamed him for it, for years.

686
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:10,050
I'm not going to blame you.

687
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:21,790
He was so young.

688
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:35,610
In my entire life,

689
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:42,660
I have never felt so much pain as I do now.

690
01:10:59,260 --> 01:11:02,560
Gul'dan does not want to waste his power on the Frostwolves.

691
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:03,920
Burn them!

692
01:11:09,780 --> 01:11:12,300
Take the weak, kill the strong!

693
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:31,200
I'll bathe in your blood.

694
01:11:31,630 --> 01:11:33,790
Maybe, but not now.

695
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:38,050
I can't give you long, but I can give you a head start.

696
01:11:40,210 --> 01:11:42,560
For the sake of your son, Draka.

697
01:11:42,770 --> 01:11:45,730
Leave... now.

698
01:12:00,590 --> 01:12:04,860
You should have trusted in your chieftain, Orgrim Doomhammer.

699
01:12:43,410 --> 01:12:44,400
Wait for me.

700
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:48,220
- Khadgar!
- How dare you to come here!

701
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:49,110
Get out!

702
01:12:49,110 --> 01:12:50,700
I come seeking your wisdom.

703
01:12:50,780 --> 01:12:52,830
There is nothing for you here now.

704
01:12:52,830 --> 01:12:54,820
The Guardian, Medivh, is unwell.

705
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:55,870
What?

706
01:12:56,070 --> 01:12:58,250
- He's been poisoned by the fel.
- What?

707
01:12:58,250 --> 01:13:00,040
Ridiculous.

708
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:02,100
What do you know of the dark portal?

709
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:05,070
You come back, and accused the Guardian...

710
01:13:05,070 --> 01:13:06,300
What is Alodi?

711
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:08,310
How does he know?

712
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:16,540
Alodi.

713
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:18,600
What is it?

714
01:13:19,470 --> 01:13:22,820
An entity from a time before the Kirin Tor existed.

715
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:26,610
We think it serve the functions similar to that of the Guardian.

716
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:28,390
Protector.

717
01:13:29,490 --> 01:13:30,700
No one beyond the Arch Council

718
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:34,120
knows of it's existence, and it will stay that way.

719
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:36,980
And you to mention it in the same breath

720
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:39,760
as the dark portal is too much to be mere...

721
01:13:43,350 --> 01:13:44,390
coincidence.

722
01:13:47,030 --> 01:13:48,060
Do I go in?

723
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:50,910
I don't know. It's never done that before.

724
01:14:09,860 --> 01:14:11,280
Khadgar.

725
01:14:11,540 --> 01:14:14,180
I know you, from the library.

726
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:17,700
You're Alodi?

727
01:14:21,730 --> 01:14:26,460
I used the last of my energies to summon you here.

728
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:30,650
- The Guardian has betrayed us.
- Medivh.

729
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:36,010
- I saw the fel in his eyes.
- He is consumed by it.

730
01:14:36,330 --> 01:14:40,580
If he is not stopped, this world will burn.

731
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,440
I don't have the power to defeat a Guardian.

732
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:46,310
Guardian is but a name.

733
01:14:46,970 --> 01:14:51,830
The true Guardians of this world are the people themselves.

734
01:14:51,830 --> 01:14:55,090
I know you see what the Kirin Tor can not.

735
01:14:55,430 --> 01:14:57,120
It's why you left them.

736
01:14:57,390 --> 01:15:04,180
No one can stand against the darkness... alone.

737
01:15:05,050 --> 01:15:07,390
I don't understand what you want me to do.

738
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:12,540
Yes, you do.

739
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:18,100
Trust in your friends.

740
01:15:19,830 --> 01:15:22,190
Together, you can save this world.

741
01:15:22,570 --> 01:15:24,880
Always remember.

742
01:15:25,460 --> 01:15:27,810
From light comes darkness,

743
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:32,350
and from darkness... light.

744
01:15:43,310 --> 01:15:44,290
Up, up.

745
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:54,080
Thank you, Moroes.

746
01:15:54,890 --> 01:15:56,970
You'll recover, Guardian.

747
01:15:56,970 --> 01:15:58,180
You always do.

748
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:03,160
No... Thank you,

749
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:06,040
for everything you've done.

750
01:16:22,270 --> 01:16:24,150
Sorry, old friend.

751
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:30,590
It seems I have let the orcs into this world.

752
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:34,930
The fel has twisted me. I...

753
01:16:35,110 --> 01:16:37,910
don't even know what else I may have done.

754
01:16:39,250 --> 01:16:42,480
I just don't remember.

755
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:53,150
Everything I fought to protect, I have... destroyed.

756
01:16:54,330 --> 01:16:56,440
I can't control the fel.

757
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:01,680
No one can.

758
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:16,110
Five legions to block Deadwind Pass.

759
01:17:16,410 --> 01:17:18,940
Another ten here, here, and here,

760
01:17:18,940 --> 01:17:20,710
along Redridge Mountains.

761
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:22,510
Supply lines here.

762
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:25,340
While the Eastern Sea hems them in both south and east.

763
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:30,510
If we hold these positions, we will be at our strongest.

764
01:17:31,710 --> 01:17:32,750
Containment?

765
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:34,440
Until there is a better option, yes.

766
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:36,530
And where there is 10 times as many.

767
01:17:37,180 --> 01:17:38,220
What then?

768
01:17:40,390 --> 01:17:41,440
If there were easy answers...

769
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:44,320
Our priority must be to stop the gate from opening.

770
01:17:45,310 --> 01:17:47,390
Fail there, and it's just a matter of time

771
01:17:47,390 --> 01:17:48,850
before they beat us with sheer numbers.

772
01:17:48,850 --> 01:17:50,430
What do you suggest?

773
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:53,330
Send everything we got.

774
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:58,180
Destroy the gate, free our people, and end the immediate threat.

775
01:17:58,180 --> 01:18:00,850
- And the orcs that remain?
- We'll take care of them later.

776
01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:02,940
After they've ravaged the entire kingdom?

777
01:18:03,810 --> 01:18:06,440
- My Lords.
- Medivh. You are up and well.

778
01:18:06,450 --> 01:18:11,380
I am. I feel... restored.

779
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:14,470
We need you. We've been agonizing over our options.

780
01:18:14,470 --> 01:18:16,520
Some of us believe there are no options.

781
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:18,770
- We need fresh eyes.
- I have news.

782
01:18:19,310 --> 01:18:22,420
- I've met with Durotan.
- You met with Durotan.

783
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:26,100
The rebellion against Gul'dan is gaining strength.

784
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:28,830
With their help we can destroy this gate.

785
01:18:28,830 --> 01:18:31,150
- That doesn't change my plan.
- What plan?

786
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:34,200
Anduin believes we should attack with full force.

787
01:18:34,650 --> 01:18:37,190
I'm concerned it leaves the rest of the kingdom defenseless.

788
01:18:37,190 --> 01:18:40,820
How many legions would you need to hold the orcs in place?

789
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:44,430
Five for Deadwind Pass. Ten for the Redridge Mountains.

790
01:18:44,430 --> 01:18:45,710
Ten more to protect the city.

791
01:18:45,710 --> 01:18:48,100
We've already lost 18 legions.

792
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:51,830
- That leaves one, two, three.
- Can it be done, Medivh?

793
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:53,850
No, it can't be done.

794
01:18:55,670 --> 01:18:57,580
With three legion, Frostwolves, and my power...

795
01:18:57,580 --> 01:18:59,490
With all due respect, Guardian, your powers

796
01:18:59,490 --> 01:19:02,130
have proven unreliable at best recently.

797
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,190
Llane. Have I ever let you down?

798
01:19:04,190 --> 01:19:05,020
Let him down?

799
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:07,220
Where have you even been for the last 6 years?

800
01:19:08,950 --> 01:19:10,630
Please, Anduin. Medivh is the Guardian...

801
01:19:10,630 --> 01:19:12,330
Not the one you remember.

802
01:19:13,490 --> 01:19:15,760
He's lost. He's unstable.

803
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:18,080
And he won't be there when you really need him.

804
01:19:18,350 --> 01:19:20,320
Find your bearings, Anduin.

805
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,140
I'd march into hell for you,

806
01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:25,060
if I thought there was a slightest chance of victory.

807
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:27,320
But there isn't, this is suicide.

808
01:19:27,630 --> 01:19:28,950
Is this about Callan?

809
01:19:30,470 --> 01:19:31,810
It was a tragedy.

810
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,960
If he hadn't been trying so hard to win your approval,

811
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:37,290
- he might still be with us.
- Medivh.

812
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:39,670
Callan wasn't ready. You knew it.

813
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:41,170
And you let him play soldier anyway.

814
01:19:41,170 --> 01:19:42,330
Anduin, stop!

815
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:43,980
You killed him!

816
01:19:44,450 --> 01:19:47,690
Commander. Please, sir. Please.

817
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:50,590
Varis. Take him to a cell to calm down.

818
01:19:52,190 --> 01:19:54,020
You are no use to us like this.

819
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:08,490
We'll protect the kingdom, my lord.

820
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:10,410
You and I.

821
01:20:23,850 --> 01:20:24,940
Why are you here?

822
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,590
The king.

823
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:29,660
He goes to fight the Horde.

824
01:20:32,070 --> 01:20:35,450
With your Guardian's help, Durotan will kill Gul'dan.

825
01:20:35,450 --> 01:20:36,710
Don't trust him.

826
01:20:36,710 --> 01:20:38,610
I've told you, orcs do not lie.

827
01:20:38,610 --> 01:20:39,940
Not Durotan.

828
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:45,230
Don't trust Medivh.

829
01:20:50,170 --> 01:20:51,880
I will try to protect your king.

830
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:54,420
Don't go with them.

831
01:20:54,830 --> 01:20:55,800
Why?

832
01:20:58,930 --> 01:21:00,470
I don't want you to get hurt.

833
01:21:14,740 --> 01:21:16,140
Come back alive.

834
01:21:39,210 --> 01:21:40,750
Hey, Frostwolf.

835
01:21:41,270 --> 01:21:42,200
Who goes...

836
01:21:44,450 --> 01:21:46,560
Now you are enemies with all sides.

837
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:48,230
I'll tell them it was you.

838
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:03,920
What happened?

839
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:08,340
I'm sorry, Durotan.

840
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:12,670
I did not see how we could side with the humans...

841
01:22:12,850 --> 01:22:14,590
against our own kind.

842
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,240
I was wrong.

843
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:20,890
Gul'dan's fel magic is destroying us.

844
01:22:30,030 --> 01:22:32,040
- Where's Draka?
- Safe.

845
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:34,090
But, the rest...

846
01:22:36,380 --> 01:22:37,880
They won't follow him,

847
01:22:38,470 --> 01:22:40,480
if they could see what he has become.

848
01:22:42,970 --> 01:22:44,620
And I will show them.

849
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:12,620
There is no other man

850
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:15,400
I would entrust the safety of my family to, Varian.

851
01:23:16,370 --> 01:23:18,770
Keep them safe while I'm gone.

852
01:23:32,510 --> 01:23:33,720
Ready?

853
01:23:34,790 --> 01:23:37,240
I would feel better if Lothar were riding with us.

854
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:39,130
We'll be fine.

855
01:23:39,620 --> 01:23:41,950
I'll return to Karazhan and get ready for battle.

856
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:44,970
Find me at the portal.

857
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:08,420
Guard.

858
01:24:09,050 --> 01:24:11,060
I know you're just doing your job,

859
01:24:11,060 --> 01:24:12,800
and a good one at that.

860
01:24:14,350 --> 01:24:16,250
But I've cool down now.

861
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:19,300
So, if you just come and open this gate.

862
01:24:19,750 --> 01:24:21,470
So I can protect the king.

863
01:24:24,330 --> 01:24:25,640
Open the gate!

864
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:27,450
I am just following my...

865
01:24:35,230 --> 01:24:36,990
- Where the hell have you been?
- The Kirin Tor.

866
01:24:38,270 --> 01:24:40,810
It only works on the simple minded, last about a minute.

867
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:43,170
Your armor, commander.

868
01:24:44,430 --> 01:24:45,460
Sorry.

869
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:51,660
They have a full day ahead of us.

870
01:24:52,690 --> 01:24:53,920
I just hope we're not too late.

871
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:55,130
We can't go after them.

872
01:24:55,130 --> 01:24:56,440
Not if you want to save Azeroth.

873
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:58,830
- My king needs me.
- AZEROTH needs you more!

874
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:01,200
If you want to save your king,

875
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:03,100
we need to stop Medivh first.

876
01:25:13,510 --> 01:25:14,650
Where is Medivh?

877
01:25:16,130 --> 01:25:17,660
We got a demon to kill.

878
01:25:23,910 --> 01:25:25,270
Go. Search over here.

879
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:45,150
Remember.

880
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:47,860
You are the son of Durotan and Draka,

881
01:25:47,860 --> 01:25:50,050
an unbroken line of chieftains.

882
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:42,850
I am Durotan, son of Garad.

883
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:46,520
Chieftain of the Frostwolf clan.

884
01:26:46,750 --> 01:26:50,270
And I am here to kill Gul'dan.

885
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:54,700
Ghost cannot invoke Mak'gora.

886
01:26:55,380 --> 01:26:57,720
You are the chieftain of no clan.

887
01:26:58,100 --> 01:27:00,580
Your people are food for worms.

888
01:27:01,770 --> 01:27:04,640
Some of us still live, warchief.

889
01:27:08,660 --> 01:27:10,550
Do I make a quick end of them?

890
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:14,690
I always thought you were one for tradition, Blackhand.

891
01:27:17,170 --> 01:27:18,430
Durotan.

892
01:27:20,420 --> 01:27:24,300
Your clan was weak, and you are a traitor.

893
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:28,670
I accept your challenge, if only to personally

894
01:27:28,670 --> 01:27:31,890
ripped the heart out of your pathetic body.

895
01:27:31,900 --> 01:27:33,130
What of the portal?

896
01:27:33,130 --> 01:27:35,680
You must be ready when the incantation begins.

897
01:27:36,540 --> 01:27:38,150
This won't take long.

898
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:04,980
Crush him, Gul'dan!

899
01:29:15,370 --> 01:29:17,600
It's the incantation to the orc home world.

900
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:22,520
He's opening the portal, we need to shut him up.

901
01:29:26,750 --> 01:29:28,200
The incantation.

902
01:29:29,010 --> 01:29:32,110
I have no time for this. Blackhand!

903
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:40,160
This is a Mak'gora.

904
01:29:42,110 --> 01:29:44,420
You will respect our tradition.

905
01:29:45,170 --> 01:29:46,630
Keep fighting.

906
01:29:53,970 --> 01:29:55,490
Gul'dan cheats.

907
01:30:05,050 --> 01:30:06,530
- Cheating!
- Shame on you!

908
01:30:06,530 --> 01:30:08,110
You cheat, Gul'dan!

909
01:30:08,490 --> 01:30:10,140
This is not our way.

910
01:30:10,450 --> 01:30:11,780
Traitor!

911
01:30:27,650 --> 01:30:29,080
Gul'dan!

912
01:30:31,780 --> 01:30:34,370
You have no honor.

913
01:31:19,650 --> 01:31:22,930
You will follow this... thing?

914
01:31:28,430 --> 01:31:29,560
Do you?

915
01:31:33,150 --> 01:31:35,190
You will follow this demon?

916
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:38,440
I will not.

917
01:31:40,850 --> 01:31:43,490
I follow a true orc.

918
01:31:45,390 --> 01:31:46,750
A chieftain.

919
01:31:52,970 --> 01:31:55,550
May your balls rot, demon.

920
01:32:00,770 --> 01:32:02,330
Anyone else?

921
01:32:06,410 --> 01:32:08,710
And you, warchief.

922
01:32:09,020 --> 01:32:10,480
You will take the fel,

923
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:14,020
and you will become stronger than any orc has ever been.

924
01:32:14,060 --> 01:32:16,270
And when the fel has remade you,

925
01:32:16,270 --> 01:32:18,990
you will crush the smallteeth.

926
01:32:21,950 --> 01:32:24,840
Now claim my new world.

927
01:32:33,110 --> 01:32:34,850
Legion! Halt!

928
01:32:34,850 --> 01:32:36,060
Frostwolves.

929
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:40,350
We are on our own now.

930
01:32:40,970 --> 01:32:42,260
We're few then.

931
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:53,710
Get to the prisoners.

932
01:32:54,470 --> 01:32:56,390
We will free our people!

933
01:32:57,560 --> 01:32:58,770
Charge!

934
01:33:08,130 --> 01:33:09,580
Attack!

935
01:33:12,270 --> 01:33:13,330
Ideas?

936
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:23,330
Very impressive. Now try shutting him up.

937
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:27,060
Oh, that went well.

938
01:33:30,950 --> 01:33:33,180
He's moving, do something.

939
01:33:33,890 --> 01:33:36,220
Fine, I'll handle this.

940
01:33:37,180 --> 01:33:38,720
You take care of Medivh.

941
01:33:46,550 --> 01:33:48,950
Hey, over here. Clayface.

942
01:34:08,850 --> 01:34:10,130
Now, men!

943
01:34:11,270 --> 01:34:12,400
Fire!

944
01:35:00,550 --> 01:35:02,440
Come, my orcs.

945
01:35:02,460 --> 01:35:07,050
Let the fel unleash the full power of the Horde.

946
01:35:14,810 --> 01:35:17,680
- For Gul'dan!
- For the Horde!

947
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:07,140
Hey, kid! Wake up!

948
01:36:09,780 --> 01:36:10,940
You alright?

949
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:14,990
Quick thinking.

950
01:36:15,390 --> 01:36:17,010
Slicing it's head off like that.

951
01:36:17,710 --> 01:36:19,190
Just how I planned it.

952
01:36:21,060 --> 01:36:22,110
What now?

953
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:25,070
The Guardian has to speak the incantation himself.

954
01:36:25,220 --> 01:36:27,540
So uh... As long as he is doing that...

955
01:36:27,670 --> 01:36:30,720
we can get in close. Distract him.

956
01:36:31,260 --> 01:36:32,410
Then what?

957
01:36:33,610 --> 01:36:35,190
Get Medivh in the font.

958
01:36:36,130 --> 01:36:37,480
Is that all?

959
01:36:50,260 --> 01:36:51,420
Medivh.

960
01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:55,110
If there is something of you still in there, old friend,

961
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,360
come back to us.

962
01:37:18,990 --> 01:37:20,140
Medivh.

963
01:37:31,640 --> 01:37:32,710
Come.

964
01:37:33,820 --> 01:37:34,900
Kill me.

965
01:37:36,910 --> 01:37:40,030
I have got nothing left to live for now anyway.

966
01:37:43,810 --> 01:37:46,530
After all, life is just fuel to you, isn't it?

967
01:37:47,930 --> 01:37:50,450
But Llane, he believed in you.

968
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:53,510
Don't kill your king.

969
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:57,260
Don't kill your friend.

970
01:38:05,290 --> 01:38:07,380
Whatever you plan to do, kid.

971
01:38:08,240 --> 01:38:09,480
Do it now.

972
01:38:15,290 --> 01:38:16,440
Now.

973
01:38:18,340 --> 01:38:19,700
Now! Now!

974
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:21,710
Now, kid!

975
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:31,860
The portal. It's closing!

976
01:38:32,060 --> 01:38:33,100
No.

977
01:39:05,250 --> 01:39:07,050
You're stronger than he is.

978
01:39:24,610 --> 01:39:27,140
From light comes darkness...

979
01:39:28,240 --> 01:39:31,810
and from darkness... light.

980
01:39:49,370 --> 01:39:50,710
Show me your eyes.

981
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:00,950
I have to go.

982
01:40:07,940 --> 01:40:09,410
I'm proud of you.

983
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:38,420
Stormwind.

984
01:40:39,580 --> 01:40:42,830
My lord. Through the portal, Stormwind!

985
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:44,710
Thank you, Guardian.

986
01:40:44,980 --> 01:40:46,210
Varis!

987
01:40:46,210 --> 01:40:48,470
Legion, forward!

988
01:40:49,650 --> 01:40:50,970
Attack!

989
01:40:51,970 --> 01:40:53,850
Garona, ride with me.

990
01:41:19,270 --> 01:41:21,410
Varis, set the men in a perimeter.

991
01:41:21,410 --> 01:41:25,040
Garona, Karos, take what men we can spare and free the prisoners.

992
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:26,970
And send them through to Stormwind.

993
01:41:26,970 --> 01:41:28,840
Form a line, shield to shield!

994
01:41:28,840 --> 01:41:30,810
We will hold as long as we can.

995
01:41:32,500 --> 01:41:34,020
Get to the portal.

996
01:41:35,550 --> 01:41:37,580
- Go.
- Bless you.

997
01:41:38,220 --> 01:41:39,320
Thank you.

998
01:41:55,740 --> 01:41:57,150
I need more powder.

999
01:41:59,690 --> 01:42:02,520
Get over there! Help me push!

1000
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:07,730
Come on, boys! Put your scorn into it!

1001
01:42:16,530 --> 01:42:19,550
Go around! We'll attack them behind the portal!

1002
01:42:29,650 --> 01:42:30,890
Take care of him.

1003
01:42:37,590 --> 01:42:38,780
We should leave.

1004
01:42:39,100 --> 01:42:41,690
We save as many of our people as we can.

1005
01:42:46,100 --> 01:42:50,650
It's the loneliness that makes us weak.

1006
01:42:51,720 --> 01:42:53,180
Khadgar.

1007
01:42:56,010 --> 01:42:57,390
I'm sorry.

1008
01:42:59,170 --> 01:43:01,600
I wanted to save us all.

1009
01:43:04,830 --> 01:43:06,330
I always did.

1010
01:43:17,680 --> 01:43:18,760
Move!

1011
01:43:26,120 --> 01:43:27,700
We've lost the Guardian.

1012
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:39,750
Protect the flank! Protect the flank!

1013
01:44:11,270 --> 01:44:14,190
Blackhand comes to claim the honor of killing you.

1014
01:44:19,720 --> 01:44:21,030
Garona.

1015
01:44:22,600 --> 01:44:25,010
No good will come from us both died.

1016
01:44:26,180 --> 01:44:29,520
Look around you, we are surrounded.

1017
01:44:31,260 --> 01:44:34,720
Your killing me is the only hope we have for peace.

1018
01:44:35,620 --> 01:44:39,090
You told Lady Taria that killing her would bring you honor.

1019
01:44:39,780 --> 01:44:42,350
Well. Killing me would make you a hero.

1020
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:47,270
Survive.

1021
01:44:48,430 --> 01:44:51,340
Bring peace between orcs and humans.

1022
01:44:54,040 --> 01:44:55,560
You must.

1023
01:45:14,370 --> 01:45:15,790
You must.

1024
01:45:41,860 --> 01:45:43,520
No. No!

1025
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:04,350
She has killed their chieftain, Gul'dan.

1026
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:07,810
The Horde embraces you.

1027
01:46:10,030 --> 01:46:11,250
Orc.

1028
01:47:49,260 --> 01:47:51,060
Mak'gora.

1029
01:49:05,250 --> 01:49:06,770
For my son.

1030
01:49:15,220 --> 01:49:16,440
Kill him.

1031
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:23,230
Kill him!

1032
01:49:27,710 --> 01:49:31,210
Gul'dan, the Mak'gora is sacred.

1033
01:49:31,790 --> 01:49:34,680
The human won, fairly.

1034
01:49:35,690 --> 01:49:37,810
Let your warriors honor their tradition.

1035
01:49:37,810 --> 01:49:40,570
I will not be disobeyed.

1036
01:49:41,320 --> 01:49:43,690
What are you waiting for?

1037
01:49:49,420 --> 01:49:51,230
Do as I say!

1038
01:49:53,160 --> 01:49:54,630
Traitors!

1039
01:49:58,310 --> 01:50:01,370
Get out of my way, I'll do it myself.

1040
01:50:01,450 --> 01:50:02,640
Who will obey you,

1041
01:50:02,640 --> 01:50:04,670
if you go to war with your own kind?

1042
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:08,620
If you do this, you will lose the Horde.

1043
01:50:09,120 --> 01:50:11,030
And this war is only beginning.

1044
01:50:51,500 --> 01:50:52,860
For your son.

1045
01:50:57,310 --> 01:50:59,810
So your spirit can teach him.

1046
01:51:31,390 --> 01:51:32,670
Garona's dagger.

1047
01:51:34,250 --> 01:51:36,260
I pulled that from Llane's neck.

1048
01:51:36,670 --> 01:51:38,500
Well. There has to be an explanation.

1049
01:51:38,900 --> 01:51:42,210
Yes. She made her choice.

1050
01:51:43,620 --> 01:51:45,120
I don't believe that.

1051
01:51:48,170 --> 01:51:51,380
Maybe you and I didn't know her as well as we thought we did.

1052
01:51:55,230 --> 01:51:59,590
There is no greater blessing a city can have

1053
01:51:59,860 --> 01:52:06,110
than a king who would sacrifice himself for his people.

1054
01:52:08,740 --> 01:52:11,760
But such a sacrifice must be earned.

1055
01:52:12,040 --> 01:52:13,980
We must deserve it.

1056
01:52:14,630 --> 01:52:19,180
If we only show our unity to mourn a good man's death.

1057
01:52:19,350 --> 01:52:22,090
Was King Llane wrong to believe in you?

1058
01:52:22,090 --> 01:52:24,430
- No!
- No!

1059
01:52:24,870 --> 01:52:27,170
We will avenge you, my lady!

1060
01:52:28,070 --> 01:52:30,960
Lead us against the orcs, Lothar!

1061
01:52:32,190 --> 01:52:34,480
- Lothar!
- Lothar!

1062
01:52:34,610 --> 01:52:36,720
- Lothar!
- Lothar!

1063
01:52:37,290 --> 01:52:39,100
- Lothar!
- Lothar!

1064
01:52:48,300 --> 01:52:52,250
For Azeroth! For Azeroth and the Alliance!

1065
01:52:52,250 --> 01:52:54,310
For Azeroth!

1066
01:52:54,920 --> 01:52:57,530
For the Alliance!

1067
01:53:20,850 --> 01:53:23,710
You will travel far, my little Go'el.

1068
01:53:29,130 --> 01:53:33,320
My world maybe lost, but this is your world now.

1069
01:53:33,980 --> 01:53:35,970
Take what you need from it.

1070
01:53:36,270 --> 01:53:40,440
Make a home for the orcs and let no one stand in your way.

1071
01:53:43,200 --> 01:53:45,890
My lord. You should see this.

1072
01:53:46,670 --> 01:53:49,960
You are the son of Durotan and Draka,

1073
01:53:50,120 --> 01:53:52,610
an unbroken line of chieftains.

1074
01:53:52,610 --> 01:53:54,830
And our people need a leader now...

1075
01:53:54,830 --> 01:53:56,170
more than ever.

1076
01:53:57,305 --> 01:54:57,939
