2
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:50,049
Two decades had passed
since the creation of both species.

3
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,634
The war had begun.

4
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:56,764
Viktor increased his army,
creating a legion of vampires...

5
00:00:56,931 --> 00:01:00,017
...to protect them
from the very first clan of werewolves:

6
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:05,147
a vicious and infectious breed unable
to take human form ever again.

7
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,233
Until he was born.

8
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:16,825
Lucian.

9
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:25,876
And although every fiber of Viktor's
soul warned him to slay this child...

10
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,545
...he did not.

11
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,679
Over the years, this child grew.

12
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:42,184
He possessed a strength and focus
that the ones before him did not.

13
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,712
What do you think, Sonja?

14
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,631
Shall we make more?

15
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,383
Of him?

16
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,009
Like him.

17
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,555
Lucian will always be
the first of the breed...

18
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,057
...the first of the Lycans.

19
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:34,111
Viktor would use Lucian's
infectious blood to his benefit...

20
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,280
...taking advantage
of the child's thirst...

21
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:39,366
...pitting it against him as he
was forced to feed on humans...

22
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,743
...Viktor's slaves.

23
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:46,582
-Get in there.
-In there.

24
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:13,358
Instead, he created a new race
of immortals:

25
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,651
Lycans.

26
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:18,071
Werewolf, but also human.

27
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,743
Unlike the others,
this new breed could be harnessed...

28
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:26,538
...enslaved to guard them
in the daylight hours of their masters.

29
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,333
Or so Viktor thought...

30
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,126
...so very long ago.

31
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,777
The nobles are upset, my Iord.

32
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,321
WiIliam's pestilence
has not been checked.

33
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:03,158
-Werewolves have killed their slaves.
-Humans upset.

34
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:06,745
Tannis, please take a note
of what pain that brings me.

35
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,665
Yet their Iost slaves
means our lost silver.

36
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,251
Enough. Have I not
increased our holdings tenfold...

37
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,336
...since Marcus and AmeIia
took their sleep?

38
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:18,006
We wiIl deal with the wolves
as we aIways have.

39
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,381
-Come on!
-Come on, quickly!

40
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,022
Fire!

41
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,751
Close that breach.

42
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,768
Have you nothing better to do,
blacksmith...

43
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,436
than play with weapons of war?

44
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,814
At least make yourself useful.

45
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:43,110
A little gratitude, Sonja,
to the one who saved your Iife.

46
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,653
I needed no saving.

47
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,030
Tell me, Lucian.

48
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:50,659
Does it burden your heart
to kill your own kind?

49
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:54,454
Not at all.
They're mindless beasts, my lord.

50
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,832
-No brethren of mine.
-Really?

51
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,626
Father.

52
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:12,055
You are a credit to your race.
Do you know how to remain so?

53
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:15,016
Keep your eyes on the ground.

54
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,102
Get rid of that.

55
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,525
You were sorely missed at council.

56
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,862
There are other demands on my time,
as you know.

57
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:30,365
I see. I hope you enjoyed
your littIe moonIit ride.

58
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,700
I was out patrolling.

59
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:35,245
You were disobeying.
I toId you to stay within these walls.

60
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,581
You risk too much
for a father to ignore.

61
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:40,125
You wiIl leave the wolves
to the Death Dealers.

62
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,086
And why, Father,
is my risk any greater than theirs?

63
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,629
They are not my daughters...

64
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,134
...and they are not council members.
You are.

65
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:52,471
And one day, you will become
an elder, your birthright.

66
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:59,144
Sonja, you are well thought of
at council...

67
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,896
...but that is a precarious thing.

68
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:03,982
They grow tired
of your games and your absences.

69
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:09,279
Dangers of the forest are no greater
than those of the council chamber.

70
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:14,534
You wiIl learn the dance of politics,
to be ruthless and cunning.

71
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:18,205
And above all,
you wiIl be Ioyal to your family.

72
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,750
To me.

73
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:26,171
After aIl,
without the loyalty between us...

74
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,715
...we are no better
than the beasts at our door.

75
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,787
Put your back into it.

76
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,291
Pick that up.

77
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,465
Move it, you scum.

78
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,973
More spin.

79
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:23,979
Get up.

80
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,819
Lycan.

81
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,988
No rest, dog.

82
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,164
Enough.

83
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:46,293
You dare raise your hand to me?

84
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,754
-I said, that's enough.
-So says the master's dog?

85
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:53,258
You wiIl not always be his favorite,
and when you fall...

86
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:54,801
...l will be there.

87
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,428
Let us hope so.

88
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:01,182
What are you looking at?
Get back to work now!

89
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,517
Get back to work!

90
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,687
Back to work.

91
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,156
The matter before the council
is simple.

92
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,949
We are under attack.

93
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,201
Six times in haIf as many weeks...

94
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,579
...William's kind
have reached our very walls.

95
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:26,207
What mayhem would foIlow
ifjust one of them got through?

96
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,127
Your fear, Coloman, is misplaced.

97
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,379
Are we not protected
by an army of immortals?

98
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:32,714
Superbly, my lord.

99
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:36,051
However, the nobles are not,
and as I have pointed out...

100
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,094
...they are the grass
on which we graze.

101
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:41,181
If we cannot protect our humans,
it makes us look weak.

102
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,642
And how would you
project strength?

103
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,977
As our Death Dealers
patrol the night...

104
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,229
...so our daylight guards
can patrol the day.

105
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:50,231
Lycans patrol outside the walls?

106
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,233
Have you lost your mind?

107
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,194
They are born of beasts...

108
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:57,530
...and the savagery of this
despicable fact cannot be bred away.

109
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:00,408
I think your fear of this idea
is misplaced.

110
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:03,703
We can create
a privileged class of Lycans.

111
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:09,334
Greater rations, finer quarters and put
them under the hand of one we trust.

112
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,252
Perhaps your pet, Lucian.

113
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,713
The one who saved
your daughter's life today.

114
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:18,426
In fact, I think we shouId
hear her thoughts on this matter.

115
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,265
She seems
to have been needed elsewhere.

116
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,267
Find her.

117
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:33,525
I wilI take your suggestion
under advisement.

118
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,276
Thank you, my Iord.

119
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:38,154
It would be gratifying
to be able to reassure the nobles...

120
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:42,200
...when they arrive tomorrow
that we have their interests at heart.

121
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,287
-Move it!
-Move it!

122
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,207
Go on, slowpoke.

123
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,959
Over there. There.

124
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,838
-Move it!
-Don't go slow. Keep going.

125
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,180
Move it along!

126
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,507
My Iady?

127
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,757
Is it true what you told my father...

128
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:47,719
...that you feel nothing
when you kill them?

129
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,389
They're just animaIs...

130
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:54,517
...incapable of thought or feeIing...

131
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:58,313
...so why should l feel anything
for them?

132
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:07,822
Sonja, if l were to leave from here,
would you come with me?

133
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,328
Leave?

134
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,414
Do not say that.

135
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,833
Do not even think it.
They would hunt you down...

136
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:22,545
-...and mark you like aIl the others.
-Not if I could remove this.

137
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,213
Look.

138
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,341
I made it.

139
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,177
This will be my freedom.

140
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,515
Lucian, promise me
you won't use it.

141
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,976
-Please.
-Is that your answer, then?

142
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,270
You wiIl not come.

143
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,856
So you want me
to stay here for you?

144
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:45,735
-Like this, like an animaI?
-Lucian.

145
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:55,453
Vampire and Lycan,
we are both children of Corvinus...

146
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,497
...yet my family are slaves.

147
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,667
I wilI use this key...

148
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,378
...and I will leave this place...

149
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,633
...but l can never be without you now.

150
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,730
-Any news of my daughter?
-She's most defiant.

151
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,066
She refuses to see me.

152
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:10,611
-Will not answer her door.
-Why are the young so blind?

153
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:13,948
She risks her seat on the council,
and for what?

154
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,159
I cannot imagine.

155
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,579
We must prepare, my lord.

156
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:22,081
Human nobles are on their way.

157
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:17,011
It's sharp.
No wolf will stand before it.

158
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,515
Ready the horses.

159
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,019
Let someone else go.

160
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:28,356
-Why?
-Last night, after I Ieft you--

161
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,650
Just let someone else go.

162
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,194
In case it had escaped your notice,
blacksmith...

163
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,864
...l am quite capable
of looking after myself.

164
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,120
And besides...

165
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,873
...you can watch over me
from the wall.

166
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:55,216
Get your back to the rear.

167
00:18:56,885 --> 00:19:00,054
Lady Sonja, your father
has ordered you to stay behind.

168
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,224
I intend to see our guests
safeIy through the gate.

169
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,394
-Gate master.
-This is not a request.

170
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,396
Your father is ruler of the coven.

171
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,648
So he keeps reminding me.

172
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,454
Get back!

173
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,418
Careful, bIacksmith...

174
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,129
...lest your eyes betray your secret.

175
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:40,178
Steady. Steady.

176
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,931
Shut it, my child. Shut it.

177
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,854
Form up!

178
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:12,710
No.

179
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,962
Get your men out there now!

180
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,673
Down, boy. Your leash is too tight.

181
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,884
-Step away.
-There's too many of them.

182
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,802
They'll be massacred.

183
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,392
Stop him!

184
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,982
Ride out. Ride out.

185
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,668
Easy.

186
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,419
Dimitri.

187
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,320
Lucian!

188
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,586
Sonja!

189
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,440
Lucian, no.

190
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,069
No, stop!

191
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,834
He did it to save me.

192
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,421
Am I not master of this house?

193
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:47,675
You know you are forbidden
to remove your shackle.

194
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:48,884
Yes.

195
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:52,012
Yet you break my Iaw
after I gave you your life.

196
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:57,101
Your days of plush living
are over, slave.

197
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:59,562
Father, leave him be.

198
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:02,356
-I told you--
-HoId your tongue!

199
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,942
You have defied me
for the last time.

200
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,695
Get her out of here.

201
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:20,040
Burn the bodies.

202
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,251
Burn them aIl.

203
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:58,078
For removing the colIar...

204
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:00,414
...30 lashes.

205
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:17,223
You have stung me, Lycan,
with your betrayal.

206
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,602
You were like a son to me.

207
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,355
I gave you your life.

208
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,774
You gave me chains.

209
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:30,694
I would have thought, after all
these years, you would have known...

210
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:34,365
...you cannot have one
without the other.

211
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:38,410
Do it.

212
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,922
I toId you l'd be there when you fell.

213
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,075
-What?
-Stop this.

214
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:02,911
-He is one of our protectors.
-They are but beasts.

215
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,998
-This could stir up the others.
-Let them. Do you fear them?

216
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,042
It will be worse
if we do not punish them.

217
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:10,419
Do you see now, Coloman?
You would trust them...

218
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:13,589
...outside the walls?
We cannot even trust them inside.

219
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:16,675
By my count, that's 21 .

220
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:19,053
Continue.

221
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:23,223
Oh, what a terribIe sound.

222
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,311
Bloody stink.

223
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:47,414
Stay away from him,
or they'll punish you too.

224
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:06,016
Your concern for Lucian
was most touching.

225
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:08,227
A sIave.

226
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,270
He had just saved my life.

227
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:14,400
Was it not you who told me
to show a little gratitude?

228
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,443
And yourself?

229
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,737
Gratitude for the one
who saved your daughter?

230
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,531
I am awash with it.

231
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:23,283
That he lives shows the breadth
of my magnanimity.

232
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:24,827
Were it other circumstances...

233
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:29,289
...l would have had him fed
in pieces to his own kind.

234
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:32,209
But his punishment is now over.

235
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,380
-He will be freed.
-Freed?

236
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,757
Your judgment is clouded, Sonja.

237
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,634
We do not keep order
with sentiment.

238
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:44,471
Lucian was forbidden to remove
his collar and yet he did so...

239
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:47,599
...for however fine a reason.

240
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:50,602
He will remain in prison...

241
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:54,314
...a cautionary tale.

242
00:28:56,901 --> 00:29:00,487
Janosh and the other nobles
will soon arrive.

243
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:03,699
Your presence is expected.

244
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:12,166
I saw what you did out there.

245
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,586
Very brave...

246
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,588
...for a human.

247
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,676
Have you come
across them before?

248
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,679
Only in stories.

249
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,432
Were you not afraid of them?

250
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,184
Yes...

251
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,187
...but l wanted to live.

252
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,856
Are you afraid of me?

253
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:43,947
-Yes.
-Well, do not be.

254
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,867
I wilI not bite...

255
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,286
...much.

256
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:54,541
-You are like them?
-No.

257
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:59,046
A Lycan, yes, but not like them.

258
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:03,217
Those you fought with tonight
were animaIs, the spawn of William.

259
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:07,054
Purebloods, if you will.
No trace of human Ieft.

260
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:10,766
Savage, mindless beasts.

261
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,520
-As it has been told.
-But I saw you.

262
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,317
They obeyed you.

263
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,487
Yes.

264
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,574
Yes, they did.

265
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,129
Hey.

266
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:46,718
-Oh, you should not be here.
-I had to.

267
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:47,928
My Iove, I'm sorry.

268
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,347
-Your back.
-No, no, I'm all right.

269
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,391
This is my fault. If
I had not gone out--

270
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,893
Then you would not be who you are.

271
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,105
This is not your fauIt.

272
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,110
I cannot remain here.
I have to leave this place.

273
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,070
My father will be watching you more.

274
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,614
Your Death DeaIers,
are there none you can trust?

275
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:11,159
Their loyalty to my father
is greater than their loyalty to me.

276
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:12,786
Tannis.

277
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:16,123
-Tannis cannot be trusted.
-No, he knows about us.

278
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:20,377
-How?
-I have no idea.

279
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,463
If he still has not told your father,
he wants something.

280
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:26,216
Sonja, find out what it is.

281
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:53,952
Bring them in.

282
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,078
Janosh.

283
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:43,210
Do you not own
the largest silver mine in these lands?

284
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:45,879
It has been overrun, my lord.

285
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,382
Our workers infected...

286
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:49,591
...turned to beasts.

287
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:50,884
Most unfortunate...

288
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,220
...and costIy.

289
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,014
I think half the rights to your mine...

290
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,600
...should cover
the expense of our assistance.

291
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,227
What assistance?

292
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,938
We have alI seen
the fires on the way here.

293
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:06,066
We have learned of the deaths
of Baron Covasha and his family.

294
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,985
The wolves are at your door as well.

295
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,821
So why should I pay tribute...

296
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,907
...when you cannot
so much as protect your own house?

297
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:17,202
You have alI but
bled me dry already.

298
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,579
We have alI heard the stories.

299
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:23,250
Look into his eyes. They are true.

300
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,252
This place is cursed.

301
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,921
They are no more human...

302
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:30,257
...than the devils
that invade our lands.

303
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:36,013
If devils you caIl us, rest assured,
better the devil you know.

304
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,599
-Unhand me.
-Certainly.

305
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:50,235
Would anyone else
like to be heard?

306
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:55,115
-Toss it here.
-Bring food to these filthy mongreIs.

307
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:58,201
-Here you go.
-Eat it up like dogs.

308
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,215
Like dogs.

309
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:31,651
We are not animals.

310
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:38,492
Is this what you want, to be their
entertainment, their playthings?

311
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,702
Their pets.

312
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,497
Cowering beneath the whip...

313
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:45,999
...and then fighting
amongst ourselves.

314
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,586
Is this what you want?

315
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:56,593
I have lived
by their rules my entire life.

316
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,428
I've protected them...

317
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,472
...envied them.

318
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:02,224
And for what?

319
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,811
To be treated like an animal.

320
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:07,521
We are not animals!

321
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:12,109
We do have a choice.

322
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,946
We can choose
to be more than this.

323
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,031
We can be slaves...

324
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,701
...or we can be Lycans!

325
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:31,044
Morning is upon us, my chiId.

326
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:35,048
It's time we left
this wretched night behind.

327
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:39,052
-Gladly.
-There are difficult decisions ahead.

328
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,139
-I would like your help with one.
-Of course, Father.

329
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,474
With Lucian gone...

330
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:48,019
...we must promote
another Lycan in his place.

331
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:50,730
Gone?

332
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:53,316
Coloman thinks
he will stir the others.

333
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,152
We must remove him.

334
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:00,198
That will be difficult.

335
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:05,078
He has been with us so long.

336
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,629
Perhaps Gyorg.

337
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,090
Or Thrasos.

338
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,594
They would be...

339
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:22,721
...trustworthy.

340
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:25,432
Excellent suggestions.

341
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,726
I wilI consider them strongly.

342
00:36:56,797 --> 00:37:02,469
You, my child, are the
most precious thing in my heart.

343
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,993
What have you told my father?

344
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,621
-What have you told him?
-Nothing.

345
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,081
-Why?
-Why what?

346
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,500
Why have you told him nothing?

347
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,837
Would your father weIcome
the man who brought him news...

348
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:40,799
...that his
beloved daughter was consorting...

349
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,134
...with a Lycan?

350
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:50,141
He isn't well known for his gratitude.

351
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:04,948
And I am not yet in a position
to use this for my benefit.

352
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,620
What sort of benefit?

353
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,333
There are 1 2 council seats.

354
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:18,086
And we don't die often.

355
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:20,338
Sadly, no.

356
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,507
So, what if I gave up my seat
at council?

357
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,676
Simply left it to you?

358
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:26,219
Why would you do that?

359
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,888
Can you keep a secret?

360
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,227
I wilI need something in return.

361
00:38:58,502 --> 00:38:59,753
Two minutes.

362
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,880
Any longer is too risky.

363
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,804
I'm sorry. There was no other way.

364
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:16,394
So Tannis?

365
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:20,148
You were right. He will help us
in exchange for a seat on the council.

366
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,317
-Your father knows nothing?
-I'm sure of it.

367
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,778
-Sonja, this can work.
-Lucian, it has to.

368
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:26,237
Some will come with me.

369
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:28,073
-Sabas and Xristo, Raze.
-My love--

370
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,450
-I'm certain I can--
-Lucian, there is no time.

371
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:33,787
Father will have you killed tomorrow,
after the humans are turned.

372
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:36,331
You must leave at sunrise.

373
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:40,043
-And you?
-The important thing is you stay alive.

374
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:43,129
Best chance you have is when
Viktor and the Death Dealers sleep.

375
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:45,215
I wilI be
at my father's side when you go.

376
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,633
Hurry.

377
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,719
If this works, I'll meet you
in three days, after sunset.

378
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,597
There's a clearing by the river.
I'll meet you there.

379
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:03,483
-And if it doesn't?
-I will meet you at the clearing.

380
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:23,503
Face the waIl.

381
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:27,173
-Get out.
-You animals.

382
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:31,177
You. Get back.

383
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,596
Be brave, human.

384
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:42,188
You know what your problem is?

385
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:47,444
You don't understand
the natural order of things.

386
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,363
Things change.

387
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:52,532
Be ready when they do.

388
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:01,875
Consider it a parting gift.

389
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,709
Wait.

390
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:51,424
Do you not realize
this is a gift I am giving you?

391
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,259
It's a curse.

392
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:08,066
-What have they done to us?
-You'Il find out soon enough.

393
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:10,443
They turned us into-- Like you?

394
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:12,529
Yes.

395
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:13,780
Why?

396
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:16,491
He wants to use you
for his own protection.

397
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:17,867
I wilI die first.

398
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,912
Well, that may not happen.

399
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:22,413
The time has come.

400
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:24,874
At sunrise, l leave this place.

401
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,794
Anyone willing
to take the risk may follow me.

402
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:35,969
There is a new life waiting
beyond these walls, my friend...

403
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:39,305
...and you can be a part of it,
one of us...

404
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:41,641
...or stay and serve them.

405
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:48,398
The guards are coming.

406
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,488
New dogs today.
Let's see how they look.

407
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:56,948
You've come too Iate.

408
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,284
He's already gone.

409
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:34,444
Are you with me?

410
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:12,357
Sabas, Xristo, free the others.
The rest of you with me.

411
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,031
Freedom is yours.

412
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,991
Move!

413
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:28,039
This way.

414
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:31,125
Down here.

415
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:58,444
All right, move. Run, run, run.

416
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:02,699
Keep moving.

417
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,872
Keep moving. Keep moving.

418
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:13,292
Keep going. Move.

419
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,311
Fire.

420
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:02,258
Raze.

421
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:04,802
There is nothing you can do.

422
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:09,724
I wilI come back. l promise you.

423
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:12,435
No!

424
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,773
My Iord.

425
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:24,697
My Iord, Lucian is escaping.

426
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:52,475
Forest, go. Go!

427
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:11,744
My Iord.

428
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:35,142
Move here. Move it.

429
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:37,228
-You, get in there.
-Move.

430
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:40,481
-Are all these accounted for?
-Each and every one.

431
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,191
Tannis.

432
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:44,068
Come on. Move.

433
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:46,904
Yes, my lord?

434
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:48,781
Where is the key
I gave you for this?

435
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:52,910
-I locked it in the armory myself.
-How, then, is it open?

436
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:55,371
I have no idea.

437
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,582
I think I have.

438
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,293
-Kill him.
-No.

439
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,253
Please.

440
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:04,797
Check the armory.

441
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:07,008
There has to be an explanation.

442
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:09,135
Show me.

443
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:22,148
-I've never been outside the walls.
-Enjoy it while you can, Xristo.

444
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:25,067
Soon enough we're gonna
have to fight our way back in.

445
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:28,571
We didn't all make it, and I won't
leave our brothers to rot back there.

446
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:31,365
We humiliated Viktor.
It is they who will pay the cost.

447
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:33,534
But we were lucky
to make it out alive.

448
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:36,495
And there's but a handful of us.
We have no weapons.

449
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:37,955
True, for now.

450
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:40,833
The noble who brought you,
can you lead us to his estate?

451
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:44,629
-Yes.
-Good. Come on. Come on.

452
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:14,367
It has to be here.

453
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:19,163
I put it here.

454
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,710
Here.

455
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:30,424
He must have made another one.

456
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:34,512
I never doubted you.

457
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:45,731
Now, I have no wish to remove
one shackle from around your necks...

458
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:48,943
...only to repIace it
with one of my own.

459
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:50,403
You have a choice.

460
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,363
You can run and hide...

461
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:53,990
...or you can stay and fight.

462
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:57,410
Any man who fights with me
shall have his freedom...

463
00:49:58,161 --> 00:49:59,662
...and, if he wishes it...

464
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:02,164
...immortality.

465
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,879
Pick up your weapons.

466
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:15,886
Together we're strong.

467
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,558
There are other estates
to the west of here.

468
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:23,060
I want you to go there.

469
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:25,521
See how many will join us.

470
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:28,482
I wilI meet you back here
in two days' time.

471
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:30,735
-Put it over there.
-Over here.

472
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:48,247
Father.

473
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,374
Did I startle you? I'm sorry.

474
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:52,376
No.

475
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:54,587
You did not.

476
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:56,922
It occurs to me...

477
00:52:57,090 --> 00:53:00,384
...that l have been thoughtless.

478
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:05,931
So deep have I been in my own
anguish at Lucian's betrayal...

479
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:08,184
...l gave no thought...

480
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:11,145
...to your feelings.

481
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,189
My feelings?

482
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:15,816
They worm their way into our Iives...

483
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:19,612
...and we forget the travesty
of their birth.

484
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:23,199
I myself had tenderness
towards Lucian.

485
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:25,951
He could have been anything.

486
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:29,121
A Death Dealer, perhaps.

487
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:30,956
Yes.

488
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,418
Perhaps.

489
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:39,340
But he was not as we are...

490
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:41,175
...was he?

491
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:46,513
Did you help him escape?

492
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,392
Help him?

493
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:52,770
Of course not.

494
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:56,482
Are you lying to me?

495
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:02,238
There are many things
that I have done against your wiIl...

496
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:04,615
...but he is a Lycan.

497
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:10,496
I'm sorry, my dear...

498
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:13,165
...but you leave me no choice.

499
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,261
Father, please--

500
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:30,391
I wanted to believe your lies
though I knew it could not be true.

501
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:32,476
Not my own daughter.
How could you?

502
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:34,770
Father...

503
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:37,523
...l love him.

504
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:40,776
You have betrayed me!

505
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:44,363
To be with an animal!

506
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:49,576
I loved you more than anything!

507
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:53,247
She does not leave this room!

508
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:12,850
No. You're under orders to wait.

509
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,692
Here.

510
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,903
This rate, we'll have enough men
by the end of the week.

511
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:28,574
-Has there been any sign of Sonja?
-Nothing.

512
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:33,162
She shouId have been here by now.

513
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:36,582
With respect, Lucian, l do not see
the wisdom in waiting for her.

514
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,000
She's not one of us.

515
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:41,086
Have you forgotten
she is the one who set us free?

516
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:43,380
But she is a vampire.

517
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:46,467
If she has deceived you,
she could lead them here.

518
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:49,219
Death Dealers
will undoubtedly be on the hunt...

519
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:54,016
...and they will eventually find us,
but not by her doing.

520
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:02,483
I trust Sonja with my life, and as Iong
as l'm in command, so shaIl you.

521
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:08,280
Told you not to say anything.

522
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:14,828
Lucian has sacked two estates
in Brashov, my lord, and made off...

523
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:18,624
...with the contents of their armories.
The slaves have joined his ranks.

524
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:21,251
Freedom is as much a disease
as William's pestilence.

525
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:23,879
-You need to bring your pet back.
-Thank you, CoIoman.

526
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:25,714
The obvious escaped me.

527
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:32,137
I do not need to lift a finger.
Lucian will return of his own free wiIl.

528
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:36,392
I have something he wants.

529
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:39,311
My Iady.

530
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:55,119
-Luka. What is it? Where is she?
-Sonja has been arrested.

531
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:58,872
He knows about the two of you.

532
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:00,666
He will kill her.

533
00:57:01,626 --> 00:57:03,752
I thought you should know.

534
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:24,982
Nothing yet, my lord.

535
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:32,030
-It is a trap. You know that.
-I will not let her die aIone.

536
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:34,783
They followed you here.
If you go, we will lose them.

537
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:37,536
Let me tell you a secret.
They thought they followed me.

538
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:41,248
What they followed is the idea of being
free. That's what brought them here.

539
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:45,711
Now, you can hold them together until
I get back, and lead them if l do not.

540
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:45,664
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

541
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:47,833
But Lucian, you were free.

542
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:49,835
Not without you.

543
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:52,504
We have to go now.

544
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:29,499
My Iord...

545
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:32,336
...your daughter has escaped.

546
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:35,380
Of course she has.

547
01:00:50,730 --> 01:01:01,073
This way.

548
01:01:08,873 --> 01:01:11,249
-That one.
-Yes, sir.

549
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:49,037
Now.

550
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,834
How dare you
raise your hand to me?

551
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:39,129
-I do not want this.
-I am your father.

552
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:55,353
-Do you think you can defeat me?
-I don't want to defeat you.

553
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:11,203
Killing me
won't save your precious Lycan.

554
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:14,623
Please call off your men,
for the sake of your grandchild.

555
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:22,798
A miracle, Father.

556
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:26,051
A union of the bloodlines.

557
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:32,516
I curse the day your mother gave
her Iife to bring you into this world.

558
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:35,268
That thing inside you...

559
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:37,813
...is a monstrosity.

560
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:42,651
Sonja!

561
01:03:43,402 --> 01:03:44,569
This is over.

562
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:46,738
Remove him.

563
01:03:46,906 --> 01:03:48,698
Do you understand
what you have done?

564
01:03:48,866 --> 01:03:50,992
This night was not about you.
It was about him.

565
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:53,495
I could have given Lucian
to the council.

566
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:56,998
They need never have known
of your indiscretion, but after this...

567
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:58,667
...never.

568
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:01,920
No.

569
01:04:12,598 --> 01:04:16,101
If l had not left,
none of this would have happened.

570
01:04:17,979 --> 01:04:19,771
Then you would not be who you are.

571
01:04:21,315 --> 01:04:22,774
You were right.

572
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:25,360
No one should live a life Iike this.

573
01:04:26,737 --> 01:04:29,531
Others are free because of you.

574
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:33,201
Things are forever changed
because of what you have done.

575
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:35,370
-But I have failed you.
-No.

576
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:38,206
Lucian, my love...

577
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:41,126
...you have not failed me.

578
01:04:43,462 --> 01:04:45,755
The choices I made
have led me here.

579
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:47,799
Not you.

580
01:04:49,093 --> 01:04:53,054
You said yourself there are risks
that you were willing to take for me...

581
01:04:54,807 --> 01:04:56,308
...as was l for you.

582
01:04:56,684 --> 01:04:58,310
For us.

583
01:04:59,812 --> 01:05:01,813
Open the door.

584
01:05:04,358 --> 01:05:05,483
-No.
-Get up.

585
01:05:05,651 --> 01:05:07,652
-No. No.
-Come on. Come on.

586
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:10,030
No. I'll kill you.

587
01:05:10,197 --> 01:05:12,073
All of you!

588
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:40,268
The accused has committed
high treason against the coven.

589
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:44,814
She has consorted with animals.
She has abetted in their escape.

590
01:05:44,982 --> 01:05:49,194
I have saved this coven
many times over.

591
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:50,862
You have killed your own kind.

592
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:53,823
And you've commingled
bloodlines...

593
01:05:53,991 --> 01:05:57,202
...resuIting in the thing
germinating within you.

594
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:01,957
Your past gIory does not excuse
your present guilt...

595
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:05,210
...nor does your station
as a council member.

596
01:06:06,003 --> 01:06:09,881
The punishment for these crimes
is death.

597
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:11,633
How vote you?

598
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:20,725
Aye.

599
01:06:20,893 --> 01:06:25,188
-Aye.
-Aye.

600
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:29,985
She's your daughter.

601
01:06:40,746 --> 01:06:42,247
Aye.

602
01:06:42,623 --> 01:06:44,582
Take her to the chamber.

603
01:06:44,917 --> 01:06:46,876
No, you-- You cannot do this.

604
01:06:47,044 --> 01:06:48,586
My Iady, come with us.

605
01:06:48,754 --> 01:06:51,589
-Come quietly, pIease.
-Viktor.

606
01:06:51,757 --> 01:06:54,009
Viktor. No!

607
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:56,136
No, Viktor!

608
01:07:46,812 --> 01:07:48,480
No.

609
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:45,203
Lucian.

610
01:09:12,857 --> 01:09:14,190
No, Sonja.

611
01:09:14,358 --> 01:09:15,733
Don't. Just look at me.

612
01:09:15,901 --> 01:09:17,235
Keep your eyes on me, Sonja.

613
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:18,403
Look at me!

614
01:09:27,705 --> 01:09:29,414
I love you.

615
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:33,710
As I love you.

616
01:09:39,091 --> 01:09:42,468
Your face will not be here
when this is over, wiIl it?

617
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:51,436
Goodbye, my love.

618
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:55,148
No.

619
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:10,205
No!

620
01:10:13,167 --> 01:10:16,544
Sonja!

621
01:11:50,889 --> 01:11:52,890
-Fetch my knives.
-Yes, my Iord.

622
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:27,610
My Iord.

623
01:15:23,268 --> 01:15:25,353
Go. Go. Quickly. Go.

624
01:15:58,637 --> 01:16:01,305
Now go free the others. Go!

625
01:16:10,148 --> 01:16:11,232
Follow me.

626
01:16:15,904 --> 01:16:18,531
-Do you want your revenge?
-Yeah.

627
01:16:18,699 --> 01:16:20,992
It is out there. Now go.

628
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:48,477
We have greater concerns
than your precious scrolls.

629
01:16:48,645 --> 01:16:50,271
Go to the elders, now!

630
01:17:20,344 --> 01:17:23,721
Kill the dogs!

631
01:17:24,389 --> 01:17:26,057
Viktor.

632
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:51,642
You defiled my daughter.

633
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:53,477
-I loved her!
-You killed her!

634
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:09,053
I should have crushed you
under my heel the day you were born.

635
01:20:09,221 --> 01:20:11,347
Yes, you should have...

636
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:18,896
...but you didn't.

637
01:21:08,655 --> 01:21:10,865
Lucian!

638
01:21:11,616 --> 01:21:26,463
Lucian.

639
01:21:27,299 --> 01:21:28,966
It is finished.

640
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,220
No.

641
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:36,557
This is just the beginning.

642
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:38,994
But let me tell you a little something
about your beloved dark father.

643
01:22:40,163 --> 01:22:44,375
He's the one who killed your family.
Not the Lycans.

644
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:47,211
But when he got to you...

645
01:22:47,379 --> 01:22:51,298
...he just couldn't bear the thought
of draining you dry.

646
01:22:51,466 --> 01:22:56,845
You, who reminded him so much
of his precious Sonja...

647
01:22:57,639 --> 01:23:01,475
...the daughter
he condemned to death.
