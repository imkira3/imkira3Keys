00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,778
Hi. I've got an appointment
with Mr. Ullman.

3
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:16,947
My name is Jack Torrance.

4
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:19,658
His office is the first door
on the left.

5
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,118
Thank you.

6
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:39,511
- Mr. Ullman?
- Yeah?

7
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:40,804
I'm Jack Torrance.

8
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,973
Come on in, Jack.

9
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,602
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

10
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,312
This is my secretary, Susie.

11
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,231
- Susie, how do you do?
- Any trouble finding us?

12
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:54,276
No problem at all.
Made the trip in three and a half hours.

13
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,361
That's very good time.

14
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,322
Sit down a minute, Jack.

15
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,324
Just make yourself at home.

16
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,783
Like some coffee?

17
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:04,453
If you're having some,
I wouldn't mind. Thanks.

18
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,662
- Susie.
- Sure.

19
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,623
And ask Bill Watson to join us.

20
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,249
Yes, I will.

21
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:21,261
Mom?

22
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,305
Yeah?

23
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,351
Do you really wanna go and live
in that hotel for the winter?

24
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,311
Sure I do.

25
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,438
It'll be lots of fun.

26
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:35,400
Yeah. I guess so.

27
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:39,780
Anyway, there's hardly anybody
to play with around here.

28
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:44,201
Yeah, I know. It always takes
a little time to make new friends.

29
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,038
Yeah, I guess so.

30
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:49,790
What about Tony?

31
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,376
He's looking forward
to the hotel, I bet.

32
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:55,295
<i>No, I ain't, Mrs. Torrance.

33
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,131
Now, come on, Tony.
Don't be silly.

34
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:00,551
<i>I don't wanna go there.

35
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:03,053
How come you don't wanna go?

36
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:05,305
<i>I just don't.

37
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:08,350
Did they give you
any idea in Denver...

38
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:10,227
about what the job entalls?

39
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,563
Only in a very general way.

40
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:17,568
The winters can be
fantastically cruel.

41
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:21,196
The basic idea is to cope
with the very costly damage...

42
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,407
and depreciation
which can occur.

43
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:26,076
This consists mainly
of running the boller...

44
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:30,205
heating different parts of the
hotel on a daily rotating basis...

45
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:33,083
repairing damage as it occurs...

46
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,086
and doing repairs so the
elements can't get a foothold.

47
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:39,423
That sounds fine to me.

48
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,759
Physically, it's not
a very demanding job.

49
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:46,138
The only thing that can get a bit
trying here during the winter...

50
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,974
is a tremendous sense
of isolation.

51
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,688
That just happens to be
exactly what I'm looking for.

52
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:58,150
I'm outllning a new writing project.

53
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:01,862
Five months of peace
is just what I want.

54
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:04,364
That's very good, Jack.

55
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:07,826
Because, for some people...

56
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,786
solitude...

57
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:11,622
and isolation...

58
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:14,791
can, of itself, become a problem.

59
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:17,169
Not for me.

60
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,964
How about your wife and son?
Do you think they'll take to it?

61
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:23,926
They'll love it.

62
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,302
Great.

63
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:31,475
Before I turn you over to Bill...

64
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:35,145
there's one other thing I think
we should talk about.

65
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:36,813
Not to sound melodramatic...

66
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,566
but it's been known to
give a few people...

67
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:41,985
second thoughts about the job.

68
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:44,321
I'm intrigued.

69
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,865
I don't suppose they
said anything in Denver...

70
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:51,036
about the tragedy we had up here
during the winter of 1970.

71
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:53,664
I don't belleve they did.

72
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,710
My predecessor in this job...

73
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:01,880
hired a man named Charles Grady
as the winter caretaker.

74
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:05,676
He came up with his wife and
two llttle girls of about 8 and 10.

75
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:08,846
He had a good employment record,
good references.

76
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:11,306
And from what I've been told,
he seemed...

77
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:14,184
like a completely
normal individual.

78
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:16,770
But at some point
during the winter...

79
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:20,607
he must have suffered some kind
of a complete mental breakdown.

80
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:23,193
He ran amuck...

81
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:28,782
and killed his family
with an ax.

82
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:34,705
Stacked them neatly in a room
in the west wing, and then...

83
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:39,209
he put both barrels
of his shotgun in his mouth.

84
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:42,212
The pollce thought...

85
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:46,508
that it was what the old- timers
used to call cabin fever.

86
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:49,720
A kind of claustrophobic reaction
which can occur...

87
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:54,057
when people are shut in together
over long periods of time.

88
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,564
That is...

89
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,316
quite a story.

90
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:05,068
Yeah, it is.

91
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:09,489
It's still hard for me to belleve
it actually happened here.

92
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,533
But it did.

93
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:17,331
I think you can appreciate
why I wanted to tell you about it.

94
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:20,375
I certainly can.

95
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:23,420
I also understand
why your people in Denver...

96
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:25,923
left it for you to tell me.

97
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,801
Obviously, some people
can be put off...

98
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:34,097
from staying in a place where
something like that happened.

99
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:39,269
You can rest assured that's not
gonna happen with me.

100
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:43,106
And as far as my wife
is concerned...

101
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:47,110
I'm sure she'll be absolutely
fascinated when I tell her.

102
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:50,155
She's a confirmed ghost story...

103
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,783
and horror- film addict.

104
00:08:57,621 --> 00:09:01,333
Tony, do you think
Dad'll get the job?

105
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:04,962
<i>He already did.

106
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:09,132
<i>He's gonna phone Wendy up
in a few minutes to tell her.

107
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:26,441
- Hi, babe.
<i>- Hi, hon. How's it going?

108
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:30,279
Great. I'm at the hotel and
I still have a lot to go through.

109
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:33,615
I don't think I can get home
before 9 or 10.

110
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:35,325
Sounds like you got the job.

111
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:38,203
Right. It's a beautiful place.

112
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:40,539
You and Danny are gonna love it.

113
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:44,918
Tony, why don't you wanna go
to the hotel'

114
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:46,920
<i>I don't know.

115
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:51,508
You do too know.
Now come on, tell me.

116
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,136
<i>I don't want to.

117
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:56,138
Please.

118
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:58,473
<i>No.

119
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:00,893
Now, Tony, tell me.
(dc)

120
00:10:56,281 --> 00:11:02,120
Boy, we must really be high up.
The air feels so different.

121
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:11,421
- Dad?
- Yes.

122
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:13,507
I'm hungry.

123
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:18,053
Well, you should've
eaten your breakfast.

124
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:21,807
We'll get you something
as soon as we get to the hotel.

125
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,642
Okay, Mom.

126
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:29,231
Wasn't it around here that
the Donner party got snowbound?

127
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:34,444
I think that was farther west,
in the Sierras.

128
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:38,365
What was the Donner party?

129
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:44,580
They were a party of settlers
in covered- wagon times.

130
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:48,083
They got snowbound one winter
in the mountains.

131
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:52,462
They had to resort to cannibalism
in order to stay allve.

132
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:56,508
You mean they ate each other up?

133
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:59,803
They had to in order to survive.

134
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:01,263
Jack.

135
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:02,556
Don't worry, Mom.

136
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:07,102
I know all about cannibalism.
I saw it on TV.

137
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:09,938
See, it's okay.

138
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:12,566
He saw it on the television.

139
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,098
- What time does the plane leave?
- 8:30.

140
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:48,060
That gives us plenty of time
to go over everything.

141
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,187
- Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
- Bye.

142
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:53,524
Good morning. I hope you
haven't been waiting too long.

143
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:56,360
No problem. We had time
to grab a bite to eat.

144
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:59,488
Good. Glad you made it
before they shut down the kitchen.

145
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:01,406
Is your famlly
having a look around?

146
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:04,993
No, my son's
discovered the games room.

147
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,288
- Has your Iuggage been brought in?
- Right there.

148
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:10,833
In view of all we have
to cover today...

149
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:14,670
I suggest we have a quick look
at your apartment and get started.

150
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:17,464
Have the Torrances? things
brought to their apartment.

151
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:20,551
- Fine.
- I'd better collect my famlly first.

152
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:31,061
This is our Colorado Lounge.

153
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,689
It's beautiful.

154
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:35,983
My God!

155
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:38,735
This place is fantastic,
isn't it, hon?

156
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:40,279
It sure is.
(dc)

157
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:36,001
This is the staff wing
of the hotel.

158
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,297
None of the other bedrooms
are heated during the winter.

159
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:43,467
- Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
- Goodbye, girls.

160
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:45,677
And here are your quarters.

161
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:48,764
Living room, bedroom, bathroom.

162
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:51,475
And a small bedroom for your son.

163
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:56,772
Perfect for a child.
(dc)

164
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:58,815
- Yeah.
- Yes.

165
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:07,574
When was the Overlook bullt?

166
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,786
Construction started in 1907.

167
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:12,955
It was finished in 1909.

168
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:15,833
The site's supposed to be
on an Indian burial ground.

169
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,668
They actually had to repel...

170
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:20,796
a few lndian attacks as they
were building it.

171
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,298
That's our Snowcat.

172
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:25,342
Can you both drive a car?

173
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:26,552
- Yes.
- Yeah.

174
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:29,972
That's fine. Basically the Snowcat
operates very much like a car.

175
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,057
Won't take long
to get the hang of it.

176
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:34,434
This is the kitchen, huh?

177
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:36,228
Yeah, this is it.

178
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:38,897
How do you like it, Danny?
Is it big enough for you?

179
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:42,401
Yeah. It's the biggest place I ever seen.

180
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:44,987
Yeah, this whole place
is such an enormous maze.

181
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:48,782
I feel like I'll have to leave a trall of
breadcrumbs every time I come in.

182
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,535
Don't let it get you down.

183
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:54,204
It's big, but it still ain't
nothing but a kitchen.

184
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:56,623
A lot of this stuff
you'll never have to touch.

185
00:15:56,832 --> 00:15:59,042
I wouldn't know
what to do with it if I did.

186
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:02,379
One thing for sure, you don't
have to worry about food.

187
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:07,259
You folks could eat here for a year
and never have the same menu twice.

188
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:10,554
Now, right here is
our walk- in freezer.

189
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:14,766
This is where we keep
all of our meat.

190
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:16,977
You got 15 rib roasts...

191
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:19,313
30 ten- pound bags of hamburger.

192
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:22,566
We got 12 turkeys,
about 40 chickens...

193
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:25,903
50 sirloin steaks,
two dozen of pork roast...

194
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:29,114
and 20 legs of lamb.
Do you like lamb, Doc?

195
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:30,324
No.

196
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,659
You don't?
What's your favorite food, then?

197
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:34,745
French fries and ketchup.

198
00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:37,456
I think we can
manage that too, Doc.

199
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,416
Come along, now.
Watch your step.

200
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:47,758
How?d you know we call him Doc?

201
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:51,929
- Beg your pardon?
- Doc. You called Danny "Doc" twice.

202
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:54,181
- I did?
- Yeah.

203
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:57,476
We call him Doc sometimes,
like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.

204
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:58,936
But how did you know?

205
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:01,688
I guess I probabIy
heard you call him that.

206
00:17:01,897 --> 00:17:04,149
It's possible.
But I honestly don't remember...

207
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:06,568
calling him that
since we've been with you.

208
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:08,946
Anyway, he looks
like a Doc, doesn't he?

209
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:11,782
What's up, Doc?

210
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:15,828
Now, this is the storeroom.

211
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,414
In here is where we keep...

212
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:22,417
all the dried goods
and the canned goods.

213
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:25,045
We got canned fruits
and vegetables...

214
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:29,049
canned fish and meats,
hot and cold cereals.

215
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:32,427
Post Toasties, Corn Flakes,
Sugar Puffs...

216
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:36,682
Rice Krispies, oatmeal,
Wheatena and Cream of Wheat.

217
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:39,351
You got a dozen jugs
of black molasses.

218
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,813
We got 60 boxes of dried milk...

219
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:52,865
<i>How'd you like some ice cream, Doc?

220
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:57,327
Sociables, finger rolls...

221
00:17:57,494 --> 00:17:59,079
and 7 kinds of what- have- you.

222
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:02,833
Now, we've got dried peaches,
dried apricots...

223
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,086
dried raisins and dried prunes.

224
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:10,591
You know, you gotta keep regular
if you wanna be happy.

225
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:13,343
- Hi.
- Hi.

226
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,179
- How?re you getting on?
- Just fine.

227
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:18,891
Can we borrow Mrs. Torrance?
We're on our way to the basement.

228
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:21,018
I promise we won't
keep her very long.

229
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:24,438
No problem, Mr. Ullman. I was just
getting to the ice cream.

230
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:26,106
You like ice cream, Doc?

231
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:28,358
- Yeah.
- I thought you did.

232
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:31,612
You folks mind if I give Danny
some ice cream while we wait?

233
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:33,655
- Not at all.
- We don't mind.

234
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:35,532
- Good.
- Sound good to you, Doc?

235
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:38,368
- Yeah.
- Okay, you behave yourself.

236
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:44,291
- What kind of ice cream do you like?
- Chocolate.

237
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,461
Chocolate it shall be.
Come on, son.

238
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:54,051
It's amazing, all this activity today.

239
00:18:54,218 --> 00:18:57,054
The guests and some staff
left yesterday, but the...

240
00:18:57,221 --> 00:18:58,680
last day's always hectic.

241
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:01,934
Everybody wants to be on their way
as earIy as possible.

242
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:06,188
By 5:00 tonight, you'll never
know anybody was ever here.

243
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:09,024
- Just like a ghost ship, huh?
- Yes.

244
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:17,074
Do you know how I knew
your name was Doc?

245
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:26,083
You know what I'm
talking about, don't you?

246
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:36,510
I can remember when I was
a little boy...

247
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:39,429
my grandmother and I
could hold conversations...

248
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:43,475
entirely without ever
opening our mouths.

249
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,854
She called it "shining."

250
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:51,108
And for a long time I thought
it was just the two of us...

251
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:53,944
that had "the shine" to us.

252
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:57,531
Just like you probably thought
you was the only one.

253
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:00,075
But there are other folks...

254
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:03,996
though mostly they don't
know it, or don't belleve it.

255
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:11,086
How long have you
been able to do it?

256
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,719
Why don't you wanna talk about it?

257
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:26,018
I'm not supposed to.

258
00:20:27,603 --> 00:20:30,105
Who says you ain't supposed to?

259
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:34,985
Tony.

260
00:20:36,987 --> 00:20:38,614
Who's Tony?

261
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:44,495
Tony's the llttle boy
that llves in my mouth.

262
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:48,457
Is Tony the one that...

263
00:20:48,624 --> 00:20:50,209
tells you things?

264
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:53,504
Yes.

265
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:57,132
How does he tell you things?

266
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:03,263
It's like I go to sleep,
and he shows me things.

267
00:21:03,514 --> 00:21:07,559
But when I wake up,
I can't remember everything.

268
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:13,106
Does your mom and dad
know about Tony?

269
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:15,609
Yes.

270
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:19,029
Do they know he tells you things?

271
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:22,783
No. Tony told me never to tell them.

272
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:28,288
Has Tony ever told you
anything about this place?

273
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:31,041
About the Overlook Hotel'

274
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,879
I don't know.

275
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:41,176
Now think real hard, Doc. Think.
(dc)

276
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:48,475
Is there something bad here?

277
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:02,573
You know, Doc,
when something happens...

278
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:06,410
it can leave a trace of itself behind.

279
00:22:07,161 --> 00:22:08,745
Say, like...

280
00:22:08,954 --> 00:22:11,999
if someone burns toast.

281
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:18,839
Maybe things that happen
leave other kind of traces behind.

282
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:23,427
Not things that anyone can notice.

283
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:28,432
But things that people who shine
can see.

284
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,853
Just like they can see things
that haven't happened yet...

285
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:39,276
sometimes they can see things
that happened a long time ago.

286
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:43,697
I think a lot of things
happened right here...

287
00:22:43,906 --> 00:22:47,618
in this particular hotel over the years.

288
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:50,537
And not all of them was good.

289
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:56,460
What about room 237?

290
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:02,007
Room 237?

291
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,428
You're scared of room 237, ain't you?

292
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,640
No, I ain't.

293
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:14,978
Mr. Hallorann, what is in room 237?

294
00:23:16,313 --> 00:23:17,689
Nothing.

295
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:21,360
There ain't nothing in room 237.

296
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:24,780
But you ain't got no business
going in there anyway.

297
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:27,157
So stay out.

298
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:29,827
You understand? Stay out!

299
00:24:45,944 --> 00:24:47,738
Good morning, hon.

300
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,450
Your breakfast is ready.

301
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:53,869
What time is it?

302
00:24:54,036 --> 00:24:55,913
It's about 11:30.

303
00:24:56,371 --> 00:24:59,416
11:30? Jesus.

304
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:02,794
I guess we've been
staying up too late.

305
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:04,546
I know it.

306
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:08,759
I made them just the way
you like them, sunny- side up.

307
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:10,552
Nice.

308
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:14,640
It's really pretty outside.

309
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:18,060
How about taking me for a walk
after you finish your breakfast?

310
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:23,023
I suppose I ought to try
to do some writing first.

311
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:26,109
Any ideas yet?

312
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,779
Lots of ideas.

313
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:30,531
No good ones.

314
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:33,450
Well, something'll come.

315
00:25:33,951 --> 00:25:37,913
It's just a matter of settling into
the habit of writing every day.

316
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:41,166
Yeah. That's all it is.
(dc)

317
00:26:00,561 --> 00:26:03,105
- All right.
- And you?re gonna lose.

318
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:06,441
And I'm gonna get you.
You'd better run fast!

319
00:26:11,446 --> 00:26:12,614
Look out!

320
00:26:12,823 --> 00:26:14,658
I'm coming in close.

321
00:26:14,867 --> 00:26:17,369
Loser has to keep America clean.

322
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:19,246
Keep America clean.

323
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:21,707
Danny, you win.

324
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,376
Let's take the rest of this walking.

325
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:26,253
Okay.

326
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,338
Give me your hand.

327
00:26:30,966 --> 00:26:34,636
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Yeah.

328
00:26:50,485 --> 00:26:51,862
Dead end.

329
00:27:49,336 --> 00:27:50,963
We made it.

330
00:27:51,255 --> 00:27:54,091
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Yeah.

331
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:18,323
- It's so pretty.
- Yeah.

332
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:23,579
I didn't think it was
gonna be this big. Did you?

333
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:25,247
No.

334
00:31:01,737 --> 00:31:03,197
Hi, hon.

335
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:08,202
How's it going?

336
00:31:10,746 --> 00:31:11,914
Fine.

337
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:15,626
Get a lot written today?

338
00:31:18,045 --> 00:31:19,796
Yes.

339
00:31:21,548 --> 00:31:25,219
Hey, the weather forecast
said it's gonna snow tonight.

340
00:31:30,432 --> 00:31:32,768
What do you want me to do about it?

341
00:31:34,895 --> 00:31:37,064
Come on, hon.

342
00:31:37,397 --> 00:31:39,441
Don't be so grouchy.

343
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:41,151
I'm not...

344
00:31:41,527 --> 00:31:42,736
being grouchy.

345
00:31:42,945 --> 00:31:45,739
I just wanna finish my work.

346
00:31:49,243 --> 00:31:51,662
Okay. I understand.

347
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:54,456
I'll come back later
with a couple of sandwiches.

348
00:31:54,665 --> 00:31:57,167
Maybe you'll let me read something then.

349
00:32:00,337 --> 00:32:01,463
Wendy...

350
00:32:01,672 --> 00:32:04,258
let me explain something to you.

351
00:32:05,175 --> 00:32:09,012
When you come in and interrupt,
you're breaking my concentration.

352
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:10,681
You're distracting me...

353
00:32:10,848 --> 00:32:14,309
and it will then take me time
to get back to where I was.

354
00:32:14,476 --> 00:32:15,936
Understand?

355
00:32:17,813 --> 00:32:20,566
- Yeah.
- Fine.

356
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:23,485
We're gonna make a new rule:

357
00:32:23,694 --> 00:32:25,112
Whenever I'm in here...

358
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,573
and you hear me typing...

359
00:32:29,366 --> 00:32:32,327
or whatever the fuck
you hear me doing in here...

360
00:32:32,494 --> 00:32:34,830
when I'm in here,
that means I am working.

361
00:32:34,997 --> 00:32:37,249
That means don't come in.

362
00:32:37,457 --> 00:32:39,710
Now, do you think you can handle that?

363
00:32:42,546 --> 00:32:43,922
Yeah.

364
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:45,507
Fine.

365
00:32:46,508 --> 00:32:49,845
Why don't you start right now
and get the fuck out of here?

366
00:32:53,557 --> 00:32:55,225
Okay.

367
00:33:14,995 --> 00:33:16,079
Missed!

368
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,503
Don't have!

369
00:33:22,753 --> 00:33:24,463
No fair anymore.

370
00:34:32,197 --> 00:34:33,490
I knew it.

371
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:07,274
This is KDK 12 caillng KDK 1.

372
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:13,489
<i>KDK 12 to KDK 1.

373
00:35:13,697 --> 00:35:16,867
This is KDK 1.
We're receiving you. Over.

374
00:35:17,201 --> 00:35:20,370
Hi, this is Wendy Torrance
at the Overlook Hotel.

375
00:35:20,871 --> 00:35:23,665
Hi, how are you folks
getting on up there? Over.

376
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:25,250
We're just fine.

377
00:35:25,459 --> 00:35:27,920
But our telephones aren't doing too well.

378
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:31,173
Are the llnes down, by any chance?
Over.

379
00:35:31,798 --> 00:35:35,594
Yes, quite a few of them are down
due to the storm. Over.

380
00:35:35,886 --> 00:35:39,014
<i>Any chance of them
being repaired soon? Over.

381
00:35:39,139 --> 00:35:40,516
I wouldn't like to say.

382
00:35:40,682 --> 00:35:44,102
Most winters they stay that way
until spring. Over.

383
00:35:44,603 --> 00:35:48,023
Boy, this storm is really something,
isn't it? Over.

384
00:35:48,482 --> 00:35:51,401
Yes. It's one of the worst
we've had for years.

385
00:35:51,944 --> 00:35:55,155
Is there anything else we can
do for you, Mrs. Torrance? Over.

386
00:35:55,614 --> 00:35:57,783
I suppose not. Over.

387
00:35:58,408 --> 00:36:01,703
If you folks have any problems
up there, just give us a call.

388
00:36:01,912 --> 00:36:03,205
And, Mrs. Torrance?

389
00:36:03,413 --> 00:36:08,293
<i>It might be a good idea if you
leave your radio on all the time. Over.

390
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,920
Okay. We'll do that.

391
00:36:10,128 --> 00:36:12,214
It was real nice talking to you.

392
00:36:12,422 --> 00:36:15,050
Bye. Over and out.

393
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,129
Hello, Danny.

394
00:36:57,467 --> 00:36:59,845
Come and play with us.

395
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:07,477
Come and play with us, Danny.

396
00:37:09,313 --> 00:37:11,190
Forever...

397
00:37:12,983 --> 00:37:14,735
and ever...

398
00:37:15,652 --> 00:37:17,696
and ever.

399
00:37:49,186 --> 00:37:50,812
Tony...

400
00:37:51,813 --> 00:37:53,857
I'm scared.

401
00:37:59,321 --> 00:38:02,866
<i>Remember what Mr. Hallorann said.

402
00:38:04,535 --> 00:38:08,372
<i>It's just like pictures in a book,
Danny.

403
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,749
<i>It isn't real.

404
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:08,348
Can I go to my room
and get my fire engine?

405
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:14,271
Come here for a minute first.

406
00:39:51,266 --> 00:39:53,060
How's it going, Doc?

407
00:39:54,436 --> 00:39:56,313
Okay.

408
00:39:57,648 --> 00:39:59,441
Having a good time?

409
00:40:01,527 --> 00:40:02,986
Yes, Dad.

410
00:40:05,906 --> 00:40:07,157
Good.

411
00:40:09,326 --> 00:40:11,495
I want you to have a good time.

412
00:40:12,204 --> 00:40:13,831
I am, Dad.

413
00:40:20,254 --> 00:40:23,841
- Dad?
- Yes?

414
00:40:24,258 --> 00:40:26,093
Do you feel bad?

415
00:40:28,846 --> 00:40:30,347
No.

416
00:40:32,015 --> 00:40:34,309
I'm just a llttle bit tired.

417
00:40:35,894 --> 00:40:38,438
Then why don't you go to sleep?

418
00:40:42,025 --> 00:40:43,610
I can't.

419
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:47,364
I got too much to do.

420
00:40:50,742 --> 00:40:52,411
Dad?

421
00:40:53,829 --> 00:40:55,539
Yes?

422
00:40:56,707 --> 00:40:58,959
Do you like this hotel'

423
00:41:02,421 --> 00:41:06,300
Yeah. I do.

424
00:41:07,301 --> 00:41:08,635
I love it.

425
00:41:10,846 --> 00:41:12,222
Don't you?

426
00:41:14,558 --> 00:41:16,059
I guess so.

427
00:41:18,729 --> 00:41:19,897
Good.

428
00:41:23,108 --> 00:41:25,444
I want you to like it here.

429
00:41:29,406 --> 00:41:32,826
I wish we could stay here forever...

430
00:41:32,993 --> 00:41:34,828
and ever...

431
00:41:35,496 --> 00:41:36,830
and ever.

432
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:40,626
Dad?

433
00:41:42,252 --> 00:41:43,295
What?

434
00:41:44,546 --> 00:41:47,674
You would never hurt Mommy or me,
would you?

435
00:41:53,138 --> 00:41:54,640
What do you mean?

436
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:02,356
Did your mother ever say that to you?

437
00:42:03,023 --> 00:42:04,817
That I would hurt you?

438
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:06,944
No, Dad.

439
00:42:09,112 --> 00:42:10,697
You sure?

440
00:42:11,198 --> 00:42:12,783
Yes, Dad.

441
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:19,623
I love you, Danny.

442
00:42:20,833 --> 00:42:23,418
I love you more than anything else...

443
00:42:23,627 --> 00:42:26,213
in the whole worId...

444
00:42:26,964 --> 00:42:30,050
and I would never do anything
to hurt you.

445
00:42:30,342 --> 00:42:31,552
Never.

446
00:42:32,427 --> 00:42:34,513
You know that, don't you?

447
00:42:34,972 --> 00:42:36,557
Yes, Dad.

448
00:42:37,474 --> 00:42:38,559
Good.

449
00:43:19,975 --> 00:43:21,643
Mom?

450
00:43:39,453 --> 00:43:40,996
Mom?

451
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,273
Mom, are you in there?

452
00:45:11,879 --> 00:45:13,338
Jack!

453
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:28,562
What happened?

454
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:29,980
Honey...

455
00:45:30,898 --> 00:45:32,274
what's wrong?

456
00:45:40,491 --> 00:45:41,867
I had the most...

457
00:45:42,075 --> 00:45:44,620
terrible nightmare I ever had.

458
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:50,584
- It was the most horrible dream.
- It's okay, it's okay now.

459
00:45:50,751 --> 00:45:52,085
Really.

460
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:58,008
I dreamed that I...

461
00:45:58,175 --> 00:46:00,594
That I killed you and Danny.

462
00:46:03,347 --> 00:46:05,599
But I didn't just kill you.

463
00:46:06,892 --> 00:46:09,645
I cut you up into llttle pieces.

464
00:46:12,397 --> 00:46:13,899
My God.

465
00:46:14,608 --> 00:46:17,194
I must be losing my mind.

466
00:46:19,446 --> 00:46:22,115
Everything's gonna be all right.

467
00:46:24,201 --> 00:46:26,912
Come on. Let's get up off the floor.

468
00:46:33,836 --> 00:46:37,047
It's okay. There. Now, sit up.

469
00:46:37,673 --> 00:46:38,966
It's okay.

470
00:46:40,092 --> 00:46:41,552
It's okay.

471
00:46:45,597 --> 00:46:46,807
Danny!

472
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:49,059
Everything's okay!

473
00:46:49,226 --> 00:46:52,396
Just go play in your room for a while.

474
00:46:52,729 --> 00:46:54,815
Your dad's just got a headache.

475
00:46:56,108 --> 00:46:59,153
Danny, mind what I say.
Go play in your room.

476
00:47:01,113 --> 00:47:04,074
Honey, let me just go get him
out of here.

477
00:47:04,241 --> 00:47:05,784
I'll be right back.

478
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:09,746
Why don't you mind me?

479
00:47:16,336 --> 00:47:18,172
Oh, my God.

480
00:47:19,339 --> 00:47:21,800
What happened to your neck?

481
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:25,846
What happened to your neck?

482
00:47:54,833 --> 00:47:56,793
You did this to him...

483
00:47:57,211 --> 00:47:58,670
didn't you?!

484
00:48:00,506 --> 00:48:02,549
You son of a bitch!

485
00:48:02,758 --> 00:48:04,635
You did this to him!

486
00:48:04,843 --> 00:48:06,220
Didn't you?!

487
00:48:07,638 --> 00:48:09,264
How could you?!

488
00:48:09,515 --> 00:48:11,225
How could you?!

489
00:49:41,106 --> 00:49:44,234
God! I?d give anything for a drink.

490
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:49,740
I?d give my goddamn soul...

491
00:49:49,948 --> 00:49:52,451
for just a glass of beer.

492
00:50:07,424 --> 00:50:08,926
Hi, Lloyd.

493
00:50:12,471 --> 00:50:14,848
A llttle slow tonight, isn't it?

494
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:21,980
Yes it is, Mr. Torrance.

495
00:50:24,066 --> 00:50:25,526
What'll it be?

496
00:50:27,194 --> 00:50:30,197
I'm awfully glad
you asked me that, Lloyd...

497
00:50:30,364 --> 00:50:33,659
because I just happen to have
two twenties...

498
00:50:33,909 --> 00:50:36,829
and two tens
right here in my wallet.

499
00:50:37,037 --> 00:50:40,290
I was afraid they were
gonna be there until next April.

500
00:50:40,999 --> 00:50:42,835
So here's what:

501
00:50:43,126 --> 00:50:45,379
You slip me a bottle of bourbon...

502
00:50:45,629 --> 00:50:48,423
a llttle glass and some ice.

503
00:50:48,632 --> 00:50:50,676
You can do that, can't you, Lloyd?

504
00:50:51,093 --> 00:50:53,470
You're not too busy, are you?

505
00:50:54,054 --> 00:50:56,557
No, sir. I'm not busy at all.

506
00:50:57,057 --> 00:50:58,600
Good man.

507
00:50:58,892 --> 00:51:00,018
You set them up...

508
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:03,147
and I'll knock them back,
one by one.

509
00:51:04,314 --> 00:51:07,234
White man's burden, Lloyd, my man.

510
00:51:07,401 --> 00:51:09,570
White man's burden.

511
00:51:15,659 --> 00:51:16,827
Say, Lloyd...

512
00:51:16,994 --> 00:51:19,746
it seems I'm temporarlly light.

513
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,499
How's my credit in this joint, anyway?

514
00:51:22,833 --> 00:51:25,169
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.

515
00:51:25,878 --> 00:51:27,504
That's swell.

516
00:51:27,713 --> 00:51:29,423
I like you, Lloyd.

517
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:31,258
I always liked you.

518
00:51:31,466 --> 00:51:33,844
You were always the best of them.

519
00:51:34,011 --> 00:51:36,388
Best goddamn bartender...

520
00:51:36,597 --> 00:51:39,516
from Timbuktu to Portland, Maine.

521
00:51:39,725 --> 00:51:41,935
Or Portland, Oregon, for that matter.

522
00:51:42,227 --> 00:51:43,979
Thank you for saying so.
(dc)

523
00:51:56,366 --> 00:51:59,578
I never laid a hand on him, goddamn it.

524
00:51:59,786 --> 00:52:01,413
I didn't.

525
00:52:03,457 --> 00:52:08,045
I wouldn't touch one hair
on his goddamn little head.

526
00:52:08,754 --> 00:52:11,882
I love the little son of a bitch.

527
00:52:13,467 --> 00:52:16,303
I?d do anything for him.

528
00:52:16,512 --> 00:52:19,306
Any fucking thing for him.

529
00:52:23,393 --> 00:52:25,938
But that bitch!

530
00:52:26,939 --> 00:52:28,607
As long as I live...

531
00:52:28,899 --> 00:52:32,277
she'll never let me forget
what happened.

532
00:52:41,912 --> 00:52:44,748
I did hurt him once, okay?

533
00:52:45,123 --> 00:52:47,167
It was an accident.

534
00:52:47,459 --> 00:52:50,087
Completely unintentional.

535
00:52:51,338 --> 00:52:53,590
It could have happened to anybody.

536
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:58,762
And it was three goddamn years ago!

537
00:52:58,929 --> 00:53:01,932
The little fucker had thrown all my
papers all over the floor.

538
00:53:02,099 --> 00:53:04,476
All I tried to do was pull him up.

539
00:53:07,271 --> 00:53:11,984
A momentary loss
of muscular coordination.

540
00:53:12,276 --> 00:53:13,485
I mean...

541
00:53:14,027 --> 00:53:17,573
a few extra foot- pounds of energy...

542
00:53:17,739 --> 00:53:20,617
per second. Per second.

543
00:53:35,507 --> 00:53:38,635
Jack, thank God you?re here.

544
00:53:41,847 --> 00:53:44,057
There's someone else
in the hotel with us.

545
00:53:44,266 --> 00:53:46,810
There's a crazy woman
in one of the rooms.

546
00:53:47,019 --> 00:53:49,563
She tried to strangle Danny.

547
00:53:52,107 --> 00:53:54,526
Are you out of your fucking mind?

548
00:53:54,860 --> 00:54:00,699
No! It's the truth, really.
I swear it. Danny told me.

549
00:54:01,033 --> 00:54:02,868
He went up into one of the bedrooms.

550
00:54:03,076 --> 00:54:06,538
The door was open, and he saw this
crazy woman in the bathtub.

551
00:54:06,747 --> 00:54:09,082
She tried to strangle him!

552
00:54:12,794 --> 00:54:14,546
Which room was it?

553
00:54:22,221 --> 00:54:24,348

01:01:27,271 --> 01:01:30,732
- Jack?
- Yes, it's me.

581
01:01:30,941 --> 01:01:32,442
Thank God.

582
01:01:37,072 --> 01:01:38,866
Did you find anything?

583
01:01:39,074 --> 01:01:41,785
No. Nothing at all.

584
01:01:42,452 --> 01:01:45,539
I didn't see one goddamn thing.

585
01:01:48,292 --> 01:01:51,795
You went into the room Danny said?
To 237?

586
01:01:52,004 --> 01:01:53,589
Yes, I did.

587
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:55,841
And you didn't see anything at all'

588
01:01:56,049 --> 01:01:58,051
Absolutely nothing.

589
01:01:58,260 --> 01:01:59,511
How is he?

590
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:01,513
He's still asleep.

591
01:02:01,972 --> 01:02:03,056
Good.

592
01:02:08,854 --> 01:02:11,940
I'm sure he'll be himself again
in the morning.

593
01:02:16,487 --> 01:02:18,947
Are you sure it was the right room?

594
01:02:19,114 --> 01:02:22,284
I mean, maybe Danny made a mistake.

595
01:02:22,493 --> 01:02:24,870
He must have gone in that room.

596
01:02:25,078 --> 01:02:27,748
The door was open, the llghts were on.

597
01:02:30,375 --> 01:02:32,711
I just don't understand it.

598
01:02:37,049 --> 01:02:40,093
What about those bruises
on his neck?

599
01:02:42,221 --> 01:02:44,598
Somebody did that to him.

600
01:02:52,856 --> 01:02:54,316
I think...

601
01:02:56,026 --> 01:02:58,529
he did it to himself.

602
01:03:04,535 --> 01:03:05,786
No.

603
01:03:06,453 --> 01:03:08,539
That's not possible.

604
01:03:13,794 --> 01:03:17,464
Once you rule out his version
of what happened...

605
01:03:17,673 --> 01:03:20,259
there is no other explanation.

606
01:03:20,759 --> 01:03:22,094
Is there?
(dc)

607
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:31,562
<i>Whatever the explanation is...

608
01:03:35,065 --> 01:03:36,441
<i>...I think we...

609
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:39,361
<i>...have to get Danny out of here.

610
01:03:44,158 --> 01:03:45,993
Get him out of here?

611
01:03:47,786 --> 01:03:49,288
Yes.

612
01:03:50,164 --> 01:03:51,874
You mean...

613
01:03:52,916 --> 01:03:54,877
just leave the hotel?

614
01:03:56,086 --> 01:03:57,504
Yes.

615
01:04:03,886 --> 01:04:05,345
<i>It is so...

616
01:04:05,596 --> 01:04:07,931
typical of you to create
a problem like this...

617
01:04:08,098 --> 01:04:10,767
when I finally have a chance
to accompllsh something!

618
01:04:10,934 --> 01:04:13,437
When I'm really into my work!

619
01:04:13,687 --> 01:04:17,608
I could really write my own ticket
if I went back now, couldn't I?

620
01:04:17,858 --> 01:04:21,612
Shovellng out driveways,
work in a car wash.

621
01:04:21,778 --> 01:04:23,906
Any of that appeal to you?

622
01:04:25,115 --> 01:04:27,784
I have let you fuck up
my llfe so far...

623
01:04:27,993 --> 01:04:31,580
but I am not gonna let you
fuck this up.

624
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:45,195
<i>Good evening. Forest Service.

625
01:05:45,362 --> 01:05:47,698
Hello. My name is Dick Hallorann.

<i>Good evening.
<i>What can I do for you?

628
01:05:52,828 --> 01:05:56,373
I've been trying to make
an urgent phone call up there...

629
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:59,793
but the operator said
that the phone llnes are down.

630
01:06:00,043 --> 01:06:03,630
A lot of lines around here
are down due to the storm.

631
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:06,508
I hate to put you through
any trouble...

632
01:06:06,717 --> 01:06:09,970
but there's a famlly up there
all by themselves with a young kid.

633
01:06:10,137 --> 01:06:11,763
With this storm and everything...

634
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:14,933
I'd appreciate it if you'd give
them a call on your radio...

635
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:17,060
just to see if everything's okay.

636
01:06:17,603 --> 01:06:18,896
I'll be glad to do that.

637
01:06:19,104 --> 01:06:21,899
Why don't you call me back
in about 20 minutes?

638
01:06:22,149 --> 01:06:24,151
<i>Thank you very much.
<i>I'll do that.

639
01:06:24,359 --> 01:06:25,819
All right, sir.

Hi, Lloyd.

643
01:07:15,994 --> 01:07:17,871
Been away, but now I'm back.

01:07:21,708 --> 01:07:24,336
It's good to be back, Lloyd.

647
01:07:25,003 --> 01:07:26,713
What'll it be, sir?

648
01:07:27,506 --> 01:07:29,800
Hair of the dog that bit me.

649
01:07:31,176 --> 01:07:32,845
Bourbon on the rocks.

650
01:07:33,679 --> 01:07:35,097
That'll do her.

651
01:07:48,610 --> 01:07:50,821
No charge to you, Mr. Torrance.

652
01:07:52,322 --> 01:07:54,324
No charge?

653
01:07:55,033 --> 01:07:57,035
Your money's no good here.

654
01:08:02,666 --> 01:08:04,376
Orders from the house.

655
01:08:07,588 --> 01:08:10,090
Orders from the house.

656
01:08:13,302 --> 01:08:15,345
Drink up, Mr. Torrance.

657
01:08:17,556 --> 01:08:22,019
I'm the kind of man likes to know
who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.

658
01:08:24,396 --> 01:08:27,357
It's not a matter that concerns you,
Mr. Torrance.

659
01:08:27,524 --> 01:08:29,443
At least, not at this point.

660
01:08:34,239 --> 01:08:36,658
Anything you say, Lloyd.

661
01:08:37,075 --> 01:08:39,077
Anything you say.

662
01:08:52,090 --> 01:08:54,551
Oh, dear! I'm so sorry, sir.

663
01:08:55,636 --> 01:08:57,095
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

664
01:08:57,304 --> 01:08:59,890
I've made an awful mess
of your jacket, sir.

665
01:09:01,099 --> 01:09:04,770
That's all right.
I've got plenty of jackets.

666
01:09:04,937 --> 01:09:07,773
I'm afraid it's advocaat, sir.
It tends to stain.

667
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:09,107
Advocaat, is it?

668
01:09:09,274 --> 01:09:11,443
Yes, sir.
I think the best thing...

669
01:09:11,652 --> 01:09:13,904
is to come along
to the gentlemen's room...

670
01:09:14,071 --> 01:09:16,615
and we'll get
some water to it, sir.

671
01:09:17,449 --> 01:09:20,744
Looks like you might have got
a spot of it on yourself...

672
01:09:20,911 --> 01:09:21,954
Jeevesy old boy.

673
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:25,290
That doesn't matter, sir.
You're the important one.

674
01:09:25,624 --> 01:09:28,001
Awfully nice of you to say.

675
01:09:28,418 --> 01:09:31,255
Of course, I intended to change
my jacket this evening...

676
01:09:31,421 --> 01:09:33,757
before the fish and goose soiree.

677
01:09:33,924 --> 01:09:36,635
- Very wise, sir. Very wise.
- Here. I'll just...

678
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:40,597
hold this for you there, Jeevesy.

679
01:09:40,764 --> 01:09:42,599
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

680
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:47,271
Let's see if we can improve this
with a llttle water, sir.

681
01:09:47,437 --> 01:09:48,730
All right. I'll just...

682
01:09:48,939 --> 01:09:53,110
set my bourbon and advocaat
down right there.

683
01:09:53,694 --> 01:09:55,112
Won't keep you a moment.

684
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:56,738
Fine.

685
01:09:59,741 --> 01:10:01,451
What do they call you, Jeevesy?

686
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:04,246
Grady, sir. Delbert Grady.

687
01:10:09,001 --> 01:10:11,378
- Grady?
- Yes, sir.

688
01:10:12,546 --> 01:10:13,881
Delbert Grady.

689
01:10:14,089 --> 01:10:15,632
That's right, sir.

690
01:10:24,308 --> 01:10:25,767
Mr. Grady...

691
01:10:26,518 --> 01:10:28,645
haven't I seen you somewhere before?

692
01:10:28,812 --> 01:10:31,523
Why, no, sir. I don't believe so.

693
01:10:38,572 --> 01:10:40,407
It's coming off now, sir.

694
01:10:45,329 --> 01:10:46,914
Mr. Grady...

695
01:10:48,415 --> 01:10:50,876
weren't you once the caretaker here?

696
01:10:51,084 --> 01:10:53,879
Why, no, sir. I don't believe so.

697
01:10:56,924 --> 01:11:00,219
You a married man, are you, Mr. Grady?

698
01:11:00,511 --> 01:11:04,765
Yes, sir.
I have a wife and two daughters, sir.

699
01:11:05,766 --> 01:11:07,309
And...

700
01:11:09,019 --> 01:11:10,229
where are they now?

701
01:11:10,437 --> 01:11:14,525
They're somewhere around.
I'm not quite sure at the moment.

702
01:11:22,574 --> 01:11:27,579
Mr. Grady, you were the caretaker here.

703
01:11:29,039 --> 01:11:31,041
I recognize you.

704
01:11:32,417 --> 01:11:35,546
I saw your picture in the newspapers.

705
01:11:35,921 --> 01:11:37,673
You...

706
01:11:38,173 --> 01:11:41,677
chopped your wife and daughter
up into little bits.

707
01:11:42,177 --> 01:11:43,595
And...

708
01:11:44,179 --> 01:11:46,140
then you blew your brains out.

709
01:11:56,066 --> 01:11:57,860
That's strange, sir.

710
01:11:58,861 --> 01:12:01,572
I don't have any recollection
of that at all.

711
01:12:05,284 --> 01:12:07,161
Mr. Grady...

712
01:12:07,578 --> 01:12:10,914
you were the caretaker here.

713
01:12:18,755 --> 01:12:21,508
I'm sorry to differ with you, sir.

714
01:12:23,385 --> 01:12:25,095
But you...

715
01:12:25,846 --> 01:12:27,681
are the caretaker.

716
01:12:29,933 --> 01:12:32,853
You've always been the caretaker.

717
01:12:35,772 --> 01:12:37,608
I should know, sir.

718
01:12:39,026 --> 01:12:41,612
I've always been here.

719
01:12:59,838 --> 01:13:02,049
Did you know, Mr. Torrance...

720
01:13:02,299 --> 01:13:04,051
that your son...

721
01:13:04,468 --> 01:13:07,137
is attempting
to bring an outside party...

722
01:13:07,346 --> 01:13:09,556
into this situation?

723
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:13,811
Did you know that?

724
01:13:17,523 --> 01:13:19,274
No.

725
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:22,194
He is, Mr. Torrance.

726
01:13:24,530 --> 01:13:25,697
Who?

727
01:13:27,950 --> 01:13:29,576
A nigger.

728
01:13:33,622 --> 01:13:35,040
A nigger?

729
01:13:37,793 --> 01:13:39,211
A nigger...

730
01:13:39,419 --> 01:13:40,546
cook.

731
01:13:47,052 --> 01:13:48,262
How?

732
01:13:50,681 --> 01:13:52,432
Your son...

733
01:13:52,850 --> 01:13:55,686
has a very great talent.

734
01:13:56,687 --> 01:14:00,190
I don't think you are aware
how great it is.

735
01:14:00,858 --> 01:14:04,111
But he is attempting to use
that very talent...

736
01:14:04,319 --> 01:14:06,280
against your will.

737
01:14:14,830 --> 01:14:16,081
Well...

738
01:14:18,834 --> 01:14:21,920
he is a very willful boy.

739
01:14:24,339 --> 01:14:26,717
lndeed he is, Mr. Torrance.

740
01:14:26,925 --> 01:14:29,845
A very willful boy.

741
01:14:30,012 --> 01:14:31,346
A rather...

742
01:14:31,555 --> 01:14:33,098
naughty boy...

743
01:14:33,307 --> 01:14:36,518
if I may be so bold, sir.

744
01:14:43,734 --> 01:14:45,527
It's his mother.

745
01:14:47,654 --> 01:14:49,114
She...

746
01:14:49,323 --> 01:14:51,325
interferes.

747
01:14:54,411 --> 01:14:57,539
Perhaps they need a good...

748
01:14:57,748 --> 01:14:59,333
talking- to.

749
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:03,545
If you don't mind my saying so.

750
01:15:04,379 --> 01:15:06,006
Perhaps...

751
01:15:06,548 --> 01:15:08,258
a bit more.

752
01:15:11,428 --> 01:15:12,679
My girls, sir...

753
01:15:12,888 --> 01:15:16,683
they didn't care for
the Overlook at first.

754
01:15:17,351 --> 01:15:21,271
One of them actually stole
a pack of matches...

755
01:15:21,438 --> 01:15:24,107
and tried to burn it down.

756
01:15:25,192 --> 01:15:26,819
But I...

757
01:15:27,069 --> 01:15:29,029
corrected them, sir.

758
01:15:30,364 --> 01:15:34,493
And when my wife tried to prevent me
from doing my duty...

759
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:35,953
I...

760
01:15:36,954 --> 01:15:39,081
corrected her.

What are you doing down here?

785
01:21:01,987 --> 01:21:04,323
I just...

786
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:05,782
wanted...

787
01:21:06,241 --> 01:21:07,993
to talk to you.

788
01:21:10,370 --> 01:21:11,580
Okay.

789
01:21:12,206 --> 01:21:13,707
Let's talk.

790
01:21:23,509 --> 01:21:25,511
What do you wanna talk about?

791
01:21:33,393 --> 01:21:36,563
I can't really remember.

792
01:21:37,397 --> 01:21:39,525
You can't remember?

793
01:21:40,317 --> 01:21:41,652
No...

794
01:21:42,027 --> 01:21:43,403
I can't.

795
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:51,995
<i>Maybe it was about Danny?

796
01:21:54,373 --> 01:21:57,084
<i>Maybe it was about him.

797
01:22:00,712 --> 01:22:04,007
<i>I think we should discuss Danny.

798
01:22:06,802 --> 01:22:08,595
<i>I think...

799
01:22:09,012 --> 01:22:12,766
<i>...we should discuss
<i>what should be done with him.

800
01:22:17,479 --> 01:22:20,107
What should be done with him?

801
01:22:25,070 --> 01:22:26,822
I don't know.

802
01:22:27,364 --> 01:22:29,366
I don't think that's true.

803
01:22:29,575 --> 01:22:34,079
I think you have some very definite ideas
about what should be done with Danny.

804
01:22:34,288 --> 01:22:36,874
And I'd like to know what they are.

805
01:22:38,792 --> 01:22:40,586
Well, I...

806
01:22:40,878 --> 01:22:45,299
I think maybe he should be taken
to a doctor.

807
01:22:45,466 --> 01:22:48,802
You think "maybe"
he should be taken to a doctor?

808
01:22:48,969 --> 01:22:50,804
Yes.

809
01:22:51,013 --> 01:22:54,349
When do you think "maybe"
he should be taken to a doctor?

810
01:22:54,975 --> 01:22:56,351
As soon as possible?

811
01:22:56,977 --> 01:22:59,313
"As soon as possible?"

812
01:22:59,521 --> 01:23:03,400
Jack, please.

813
01:23:04,818 --> 01:23:08,071
You believe his health might be at stake.

814
01:23:09,656 --> 01:23:11,158
Yes.

815
01:23:12,493 --> 01:23:17,289
- And you are concerned about him.
- Yes.

816
01:23:17,748 --> 01:23:19,958
And are you concerned about me?

817
01:23:20,792 --> 01:23:21,960
Of course I am.

818
01:23:22,169 --> 01:23:24,379
Of course you are!

819
01:23:24,588 --> 01:23:27,758
Have you ever thought about
my responsibllities?

820
01:23:27,925 --> 01:23:29,426
What are you talking about?

821
01:23:29,635 --> 01:23:32,471
Have you ever had a single moment's...

822
01:23:32,679 --> 01:23:34,765
thought about my responsibilities?

823
01:23:34,932 --> 01:23:37,142
Have you ever thought
for a single moment...

824
01:23:37,392 --> 01:23:40,187
about my responsibllities
to my employers?!

825
01:23:40,479 --> 01:23:42,314
Has is ever occurred to you...

826
01:23:42,523 --> 01:23:46,026
that I have agreed to look after
the hotel untll May 1 st?

827
01:23:46,193 --> 01:23:48,237
Does it matter to you at all...

828
01:23:48,403 --> 01:23:51,532
that the owners have placed
their complete confidence in me...

829
01:23:51,740 --> 01:23:54,868
and that I have signed
a letter of agreement...

830
01:23:55,077 --> 01:23:57,621
in which I've accepted
that responsibility?

831
01:23:58,163 --> 01:24:00,165
Do you have the slightest idea...

832
01:24:00,374 --> 01:24:03,627
what a moral and ethical
principle is? Do you?!

833
01:24:04,002 --> 01:24:07,089
Has it ever occurred to you what
would happen to my future...

834
01:24:07,297 --> 01:24:09,675
if I fall to live up to
my responsibllities?

835
01:24:09,883 --> 01:24:12,177
Has it ever occurred to you?
Has it?!

836
01:24:12,386 --> 01:24:13,929
Stay away from me!

837
01:24:14,805 --> 01:24:15,848
Why?

838
01:24:16,140 --> 01:24:19,101
I just wanna go back to my room.

839
01:24:19,351 --> 01:24:20,602
Why?

840
01:24:21,019 --> 01:24:22,062
Well...

841
01:24:23,230 --> 01:24:25,315
I'm very confused.

842
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:30,070
And I just need a chance
to think things over.

843
01:24:31,113 --> 01:24:35,033
You've had your whole fucking llfe
to think things over!

844
01:24:35,242 --> 01:24:38,036
What good's a few minutes more
gonna do you now?

845
01:24:38,996 --> 01:24:40,497
Stay away from me!

846
01:24:40,831 --> 01:24:42,124
Please!

847
01:24:42,875 --> 01:24:43,959
Don't hurt me.

848
01:24:44,168 --> 01:24:45,460
I'm not gonna hurt you.

849
01:24:45,711 --> 01:24:47,880
- Stay away from me! Stay away!
- Wendy.

850
01:24:48,046 --> 01:24:49,173
Darllng.

851
01:24:49,339 --> 01:24:50,924
Light of my llfe.

852
01:24:51,341 --> 01:24:52,718
I'm not gonna hurt you.

853
01:24:52,885 --> 01:24:54,887
You didn't let me finish my sentence.

854
01:24:55,095 --> 01:24:57,347
I said, "I'm not gonna hurt you."

855
01:24:57,514 --> 01:25:00,267
I'm just gonna bash your brains in.

856
01:25:00,559 --> 01:25:03,520
I'm gonna bash them
right the fuck in.

857
01:25:04,563 --> 01:25:06,148
Stay away from me!

858
01:25:06,648 --> 01:25:07,691
Don't hurt me!

859
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:10,277
I'm not gonna hurt you.

860
01:25:10,569 --> 01:25:12,070
Stay away from me!

861
01:25:12,362 --> 01:25:13,447
Stay away!

862
01:25:14,281 --> 01:25:15,532
Please!

863
01:25:16,575 --> 01:25:18,368
Stop swinging the bat.

864
01:25:18,535 --> 01:25:19,786
Stay away from me.

865
01:25:20,579 --> 01:25:21,872
Put the bat down, Wendy.

866
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:23,582
Stop it!

867
01:25:23,790 --> 01:25:26,168
Wendy, give me the bat.

868
01:25:26,376 --> 01:25:27,461
Please!

869
01:25:27,753 --> 01:25:29,963
- Stay away!
- Give me the bat.

870
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:31,215
Stop it!

871
01:25:31,465 --> 01:25:32,883
Give me the bat.

872
01:25:33,050 --> 01:25:35,052
- Stay away from me.
- Stop swinging the bat.

873
01:25:35,219 --> 01:25:36,428
Please stop!

874
01:25:36,595 --> 01:25:37,805
Give me the bat.

875
01:25:38,013 --> 01:25:39,223
Stay away from me.

876
01:25:39,515 --> 01:25:43,060
- Stop it!
- Give me the bat. Give me the bat.

877
01:25:43,310 --> 01:25:44,394
Goddamn... !

878
01:26:59,595 --> 01:27:01,305
What are you doing?

879
01:27:04,099 --> 01:27:05,559
Wait a minute.

880
01:27:06,977 --> 01:27:08,979
What are you doing?

881
01:27:11,815 --> 01:27:13,066
What are you doing?

882
01:27:26,997 --> 01:27:28,499
Wait a minute!

883
01:27:30,876 --> 01:27:32,461
What are you doing?

884
01:27:32,711 --> 01:27:34,379
Open the door!

885
01:27:35,714 --> 01:27:36,757
Goddamn it!

886
01:27:37,007 --> 01:27:40,552
Let me out of here!
Open the goddamn door!

887
01:27:44,223 --> 01:27:45,516
Wendy, listen.

888
01:27:45,933 --> 01:27:48,852
Let me out and I'll forget
the whole goddamn thing.

889
01:27:49,061 --> 01:27:51,522
It'll be just like
nothing ever happened.

890
01:28:04,868 --> 01:28:07,579
Wendy, baby.

891
01:28:08,789 --> 01:28:12,084
I think you hurt my head real bad.

892
01:28:13,669 --> 01:28:15,337
I'm dizzy.

893
01:28:16,338 --> 01:28:18,549
I need a doctor.

894
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:26,640
Honey.

895
01:28:29,309 --> 01:28:31,645
Don't leave me in here.

896
01:28:40,237 --> 01:28:42,156
I'm gonna go now.

897
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:47,077
I'm gonna try...

898
01:28:47,244 --> 01:28:50,247
to get Danny down the Sidewinder...

899
01:28:50,956 --> 01:28:53,333
in the Snowcat today.

900
01:28:55,586 --> 01:28:57,379
I'll bring back a doctor.

901
01:29:02,759 --> 01:29:04,636
I'm gonna go now.

902
01:29:09,516 --> 01:29:11,101
Yes?

903
01:29:12,019 --> 01:29:15,814
You've got a big surprise
coming to you.

904
01:29:17,316 --> 01:29:19,860
You're not going anywhere.

905
01:29:21,612 --> 01:29:25,699
Go check out the Snowcat and the
radio, and you'll see what I mean.

906
01:29:30,329 --> 01:29:31,997
Go check it out.

907
01:29:34,166 --> 01:29:36,335
Go check it out!

908
01:29:39,713 --> 01:29:41,673
Go check it out.

909
01:31:26,612 --> 01:31:31,950
- Wendy?
- It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.

910
01:31:32,701 --> 01:31:34,620
Delbert Grady.

911
01:31:36,246 --> 01:31:37,831
Grady?

912
01:31:58,268 --> 01:32:00,062
Hello, Grady.

913
01:32:04,775 --> 01:32:06,568
Mr. Torrance...

914
01:32:08,529 --> 01:32:12,282
I see you can hardly
have taken care of the...

915
01:32:12,491 --> 01:32:15,494
business we discussed.

916
01:32:22,209 --> 01:32:25,129
No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady.

917
01:32:26,004 --> 01:32:30,092
I'll deal with that situation
as soon as I get out of here.

918
01:32:30,926 --> 01:32:33,679
Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance?

919
01:32:34,179 --> 01:32:36,014
I wonder.

920
01:32:37,141 --> 01:32:39,309
I have my doubts.

921
01:32:40,477 --> 01:32:44,731
I, and others, have come to belleve...

922
01:32:44,940 --> 01:32:47,901
that your heart is not in this.

923
01:32:48,569 --> 01:32:51,113
That you haven't the belly for it.

924
01:32:57,327 --> 01:33:01,540
Just give me one more chance
to prove it, Mr. Grady.

925
01:33:02,416 --> 01:33:04,334
That's all I ask.

926
01:33:05,878 --> 01:33:10,132
Your wife appears to be stronger
than we imagined, Mr. Torrance.

927
01:33:10,340 --> 01:33:11,842
Somewhat more...

928
01:33:12,009 --> 01:33:13,969
resourceful.

929
01:33:14,219 --> 01:33:17,014
She seems to have got the better of you.

930
01:33:20,267 --> 01:33:22,936
For the moment, Mr. Grady.

931
01:33:23,645 --> 01:33:25,856
Only for the moment.

932
01:33:27,733 --> 01:33:31,862
I fear you will have to deal
with this matter...

933
01:33:32,154 --> 01:33:35,866
in the harshest possible way,
Mr. Torrance.

934
01:33:36,408 --> 01:33:37,993
I fear...

935
01:33:38,243 --> 01:33:40,871
that is the only thing to do.

936
01:33:44,291 --> 01:33:46,376
There's nothing I look forward to...

937
01:33:46,543 --> 01:33:50,506
with greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.

938
01:33:51,882 --> 01:33:54,635
You give your word on that,
do you, Mr. Torrance?

939
01:33:56,094 --> 01:33:58,138
I give you my word.

940
01:35:10,252 --> 01:35:12,796
<i>Redrum.

941
01:35:13,755 --> 01:35:16,300
<i>Redrum.

942
01:37:24,219 --> 01:37:25,846
Danny, stop it!

943
01:38:21,276 --> 01:38:24,154
Wendy, I'm home.

944
01:39:01,441 --> 01:39:04,319
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

945
01:39:29,845 --> 01:39:31,722
I can't get out.

946
01:39:32,514 --> 01:39:33,724
Run!

947
01:39:34,516 --> 01:39:35,934
Run and hide!

948
01:39:36,477 --> 01:39:37,603
Run!

949
01:39:37,811 --> 01:39:38,979
Quick!

950
01:39:40,731 --> 01:39:45,235
Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in.

951
01:39:51,033 --> 01:39:54,411
Not by the hair on your chinny- chin- chin?

952
01:39:55,954 --> 01:39:57,998
Then I'll huff...

953
01:39:58,165 --> 01:40:00,083
and I'll puff...

954
01:40:00,292 --> 01:40:02,336
and I'll blow your house in!

955
01:40:17,267 --> 01:40:18,644
Please!

956
01:40:19,353 --> 01:40:21,146
Don't!

957
01:40:21,814 --> 01:40:23,357
Don't!

958
01:40:28,612 --> 01:40:31,949
No! Please! Please!

959
01:40:39,540 --> 01:40:41,291
Please!

960
01:40:41,917 --> 01:40:43,168
Stop it!

961
01:40:47,381 --> 01:40:48,966
Here's Johnny!

962
01:43:31,003 --> 01:43:32,796
Hello?

963
01:43:37,634 --> 01:43:39,386
Anybody here?

964
01:43:51,023 --> 01:43:52,900
Hello?

965
01:43:54,818 --> 01:43:56,862
Anybody here?

966
01:44:01,492 --> 01:44:03,076
Hello?

967
01:44:15,380 --> 01:44:17,216
Anybody here?

968
01:44:29,311 --> 01:44:31,188
Hello?

969
01:44:44,743 --> 01:44:49,122
Hello? Anybody here?

970
01:45:30,122 --> 01:45:31,832
Danny-boy!

971
01:48:12,659 --> 01:48:14,578
I'm coming!

972
01:48:17,080 --> 01:48:18,999
I'm coming, Dan!

973
01:49:19,810 --> 01:49:22,229
Great party, isn't it?

974
01:49:39,872 --> 01:49:42,082
I'm coming!

975
01:49:44,668 --> 01:49:46,962
You can't get away!

976
01:49:50,841 --> 01:49:53,302
I'm right behind you!

977
01:53:18,298 --> 01:53:20,300
- Mommy!
- Danny, come here!

978
01:53:21,552 --> 01:53:23,220
