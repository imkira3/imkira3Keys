2
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:53,469
Let go of me!

3
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,980
Okay, now I really have a wedgie.
Fred! Velma!

4
00:00:59,143 --> 00:01:02,603
Can you guys hurry it up?
This ghost keeps grabbing...

5
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,150
Please!

6
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,526
Jinkies.

7
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:10,605
Fred. Come in, Fred.

8
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:14,161
- Fred! Can you hear me?
- Fredster here, Velms.

9
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:18,161
Shockingly, Daphne's been
captured again. That's okay.

10
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,958
When the Luna Ghost
rounds the corner with Daphne...

11
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:23,833
Shaggy and Scooby will pop out
of the barrel...

12
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:27,341
You'll activate the conveyor belt,
spilling the oil onto the floor.

13
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,166
Just remember my plan.

14
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:34,585
Like, chill out, Scooby-Doo.
Stop shaking.

15
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,683
Me? That's you.

16
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:39,517
Right. It's me. Sorry.

17
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:57,027
Scooby-Doo, what are you doing, man?

18
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:00,332
Like, this is no time to...

19
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:03,374
Oh, boy.

20
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,040
Like, there's a ghost right behind me,
isn't there?

21
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:12,922
Run!

22
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:22,636
Go, Shaggy! Go!

23
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:26,401
- Run!
- Like, I'm trying, buddy!

24
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,479
Fred, now!

25
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:31,861
Hurry up!

26
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,360
- I got him.
- Look out!

27
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:37,027
Sorry!

28
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,841
- Sorry, Velma.
- I know, Fred.

29
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,677
- Where's the ghost?
- He's right behind us.

30
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:58,514
Skateboard!

31
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,491
Is he still after us, Scoob?

32
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,618
Banzai!

33
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:29,289
- Zoinks! Grab the hook!
- Hold on, Shaggy!

34
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:48,686
Daphne, are you okay?

35
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:53,066
I'm so over this
damsel-in-distress nonsense.

36
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,283
Where's Shagster?

37
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,736
- Like, I'm right here, man.
- Me too.

38
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:03,486
Scoob, that was fun. Let's grab
another skateboard and do it again.

39
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,202
Yeah.

40
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,774
There you go.

41
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,483
One for you.

42
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,848
Good-looking guy.
All right, nice to see you.

43
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:35,444
- Thanks for saving the factory.
- Pam, any comments?

44
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:40,821
This is a victory for any celebrity who
wants to make a quality action figure.

45
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:44,119
- What's the secret of your success?
- Teamwork.

46
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:49,254
I do a tremendous amount of teamwork,
and I always have a plan. Come on.

47
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,326
Yeah, my plan.

48
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:56,751
I knew from the start there was no
phantom. The Luna Ghost is, in fact...

49
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:03,085
- Old Man Smithers?
- The creepy janitor?

50
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,603
He wanted revenge after you
refused to go out with him.

51
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:10,556
How could you, Pam? I am a lover-boy
of George Clooney-an proportions.

52
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:16,154
- Fred, how was the ghost able to fly?
- I can answer that. Watch.

53
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:23,571
These balloons fill with a highly
potent helium synthesis...

54
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,740
giving the Luna Ghost...

55
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,406
his weightless appearance.

56
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,750
I would have gotten away with it too,
if it weren't for you meddling kids...

57
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:38,548
and your dumb dog!
I'll get you for this!

58
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,085
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

59
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,930
All right, I'm on it, dude.

60
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:46,847
- Are you set?
- I'm ready.

61
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:50,224
Fred, I can't believe you took credit
for my plan again.

62
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:53,944
Some plan. That ghost pawed me
for an hour and a half.

63
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,524
It's not our fault you always
get kidnapped.

64
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:00,570
I don't always get kidnapped.
Can't believe you'd say that.

65
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:03,986
Oh, please.
You come with your own ransom note.

66
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:08,081
- My glasses!
- Who's helpless now?

67
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:11,035
I'm going to kill you, Daphne!

68
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,115
Watch the ascot!

69
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:17,710
You guys, look, I know I'm just
the dude that carries the bags...

70
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:21,258
but we all play an important part
in this group.

71
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:25,053
I mean, we're just like a big,
delicious banana split.

72
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:28,048
Fred, you're the big banana.

73
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:33,305
Daphne, you're the pastrami and
gum-flavored ice cream. And Velma...

74
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:37,767
you're the sweet-and-sour mustard
sauce that goes on top.

75
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,818
That sounds pretty good, doesn't it?

76
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:45,818
You know what, Shaggy? You've really
put it in perspective for me.

77
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,321
Thanks.

78
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,738
I quit.

79
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:54,079
- No.
- No way.

80
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:58,499
You can't quit. I was gonna quit in,
like, two seconds.

81
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:02,298
Now everyone will think
I copied off the smart girl.

82
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:04,134
Now, wait a minute.

83
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,836
Maybe I quit.

84
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:13,562
I do. Yeah, I quit.

85
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,188
I'm out of here.

86
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:20,022
Good riddance.

87
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:22,232
Don't...
No. Don't go.

88
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,862
Come on, you guys, don't do this.

89
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,066
Please don't go.

90
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:32,791
Do I quit?

91
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,287
No, Scoob...

92
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,785
friends don't quit.

93
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,418
It looks like it's just you
and me for a while.

94
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,380
What now, Shaggy?

95
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:50,219
I guess we'll all just do
what we do best, Scoob.

96
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,395
This is primo.

97
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:05,645
Man, talk about toasted.

98
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:10,243
Man, the only thing I like better
than an eggplant burger...

99
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:14,368
is a chocolate-covered
eggplant burger.

100
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:16,908
With hot sauce.

101
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,840
Yeah, just another beautiful day
in paradise.

102
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:28,379
I'm looking for a "Mr. Rogers"
and a "Mr. Doo." The detectives?

103
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:32,142
It's probably somebody looking for us
to solve some scary mystery.

104
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,385
Nobody home!

105
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:36,517
Quick, Scoob-o, grab the food-o,
let's scram-o.

106
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:40,480
I'm looking for a "Mr. Rogers"
and a "Mr. Doo."

107
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:45,149
Let's go!

108
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:53,365
I'm sorry, dude. I'd love to help you
out. You look like a really nice guy.

109
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,615
We're not detectives anymore.

110
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:59,245
I've been sent by Mr. Emile
Mondevarious to invite you...

111
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,826
to his amusement park,
Spooky Island.

112
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:06,382
We don't go near places with "spooky,"
"haunted," or "creepy" in the name.

113
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:10,838
- Or hydrocolonic.
- Right, but that's for another reason.

114
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:16,716
But he'd like you to solve a mystery.
He'll pay you a fee of $10,000.

115
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:20,562
It's just, materialism
is not really our bag, man.

116
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,559
- Free airfare.
- No, thanks.

117
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:25,311
- Room and board.
- No, thanks.

118
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,482
And all you can eat.

119
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,855
All you can eat?

120
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,165
Fred?

121
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:51,339
Velma? Are you going this way?

122
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,386
- How have you...?
- Been?

123
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,098
- Yes.
- Great.

124
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:04,229
I'm on the lecture circuit
with my new book...

125
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:09,439
- Fred on Fred: The Many Faces of Me.
- Jinkies, that's impressive.

126
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:11,782
And yourself?

127
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:16,445
I've been working at NASA, developing
hydropowered missile defense systems.

128
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:17,908
But, more importantly...

129
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,698
- I'm on a journey of self-discovery.
- NASA?

130
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:25,210
Charter service to Spooky lsland
will begin boarding momentarily.

131
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,335
What do you mean I can't have
seven carry-on bags?

132
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:31,545
- That's so economy.
- Crap.

133
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:37,512
Oh, no. I'm not talking to you guys.

134
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,557
- What are you doing here?
- Isn't it obvious?

135
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:47,478
We all received the same letter
from one Emile Mondevarious...

136
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,609
the reclusive owner
of Spooky Island.

137
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:54,026
It's not fair. I was gonna solve
the mystery all by myself.

138
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:57,027
- And when you get caught?
- I'm a black belt now.

139
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,620
I've transformed my body
into a dangerous weapon.

140
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:03,912
It's true.

141
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,500
Far out. I guess we're, like,
all going to Spooky Island, man.

142
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,168
Where's Scooby?

143
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,300
Hello.

144
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,056
Sorry.

145
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,974
They don't allow big dogs
on the plane.

146
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,979
You've got to be kidding.

147
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:33,188
No one is stupid enough
to believe that.

148
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,781
Who's the ugly old broad?

149
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:39,701
- Say hello to Grandma.
- Aloha.

150
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:42,698
Flight 3774 to Spooky Island,
now boarding.

151
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,621
I wouldn't have agreed
to come if I knew.

152
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,790
Wait, just think about it
for one minute.

153
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:53,668
Mystery Inc. Reunites. We'll be
a team again, just like the old days.

154
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,047
So come on...

155
00:11:55,256 --> 00:12:00,546
let's do that thing where we all put
our hands in, lift them up, and go:

156
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,931
Only if Fred and Velma do it.

157
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:09,055
People are watching, Shag.

158
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,949
Yeah, Scoob, "roo-hoo."
Come on, buddy.

159
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:46,393
Now that is a beautiful work of art.

160
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:08,411
Would you mind me taking a seat
there next to...?

161
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:13,171
To my grandma. That's my grandma.
Hi, Grandma. Like, no.

162
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,714
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

163
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,049
Bless you.

164
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:29,683
I'm sorry. My allergies.
It's usually only dogs that do it.

165
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,733
- Maybe I'd better move.
- No, wait.

166
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:38,399
It's probably just
my grandm♪s perfume.

167
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:43,568
Yeah, even I sometimes get
a little allergic, you know. Oh, jeez.

168
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:48,987
I'm pretty sure Grandma wants to go
back and visit with her pal Velma.

169
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:50,834
Right, Grandma?

170
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,659
Okay.

171
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:02,764
Boy, oh, boy, those sure do look
like Scooby Snacks.

172
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:04,971
I know they're for dogs...

173
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:08,508
but they're 100% vegetarian,
and I love them.

174
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:09,893
Like, me too.

175
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:13,889
Far out. I've never met another person
who loves Scooby Snacks.

176
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,273
- Me neither.
- I'm Mary Jane.

177
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:20,402
- Like, that's my favorite name.
- Really?

178
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,610
No way.

179
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:28,872
Hello.

180
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,586
Grandma?

181
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:44,878
Velma, it's simple
behavior modification.

182
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:50,313
To cause a dog to discontinue any
action, flick it on the nose. Observe.

183
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,098
Scoob?

184
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:55,479
See?

185
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:05,611
Sit, Grandma! Bad, Grandma!
Don't eat the kitty!

186
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:14,158
Welcome to Spooky lsland...

187
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:18,920
the frightfully popular spring break
spot for college students.

188
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:23,707
Catch our Electrical Torture Parade.
It's a Dead World After All.

189
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,803
And the world famous Splatterhorn.

190
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:32,393
Scooby-Doo!
And the rest of Mystery lnc.

191
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:35,479
It's marvelous to see you!
How fanta...

192
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:38,555
I'm sorry.
That's the second time this week.

193
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:41,942
Thank goodness.

194
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:46,240
It's a new toy.
I'm just getting up to speed with it.

195
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,606
- Welcome.
- Thank goodness.

196
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,826
I was afraid I'd have
to lug those to the hotel.

197
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:56,253
That's what Spooky Island's about,
realizing your worst fears.

198
00:15:56,664 --> 00:16:01,384
I'm Emile Mondevarious,
the owner of this amusement park.

199
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:03,753
- You seem less...
- Spooky.

200
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,211
Than we'd have guessed.

201
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:09,804
I can be pretty spooky
when called upon. I can go:

202
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,390
Claws and everything.

203
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:18,233
You wouldn't want to run into me
in a dark alley.

204
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:21,726
- So you're the one who brought us here?
- No.

205
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:25,398
What brought you here
was your insatiable appetite...

206
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,440
for a juicy mystery.

207
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:31,533
The truth is,
Mystery Inc. Is broken up.

208
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:34,281
That's the beauty of something broken.

209
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:37,372
It can be fixed.
Therein lies its potential.

210
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,288
And I need you to fix Spooky Island.

211
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,878
What's the problem?

212
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:45,593
I believe somebody's casting a spell
on the students.

213
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:49,126
Now listen and look around.

214
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:52,972
Notice any difference between those
arriving and those departing?

215
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,059
They look like sober, well-behaved
college kids.

216
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:59,024
Precisely.
They didn't before they came.

217
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:02,845
They've changed.
In other words, a magic spell.

218
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:06,364
Carol! Carol, how was the island?

219
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,777
Are you tricking on me?

220
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:14,366
It's me, Brad. We've known each other
since we were 3.

221
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,945
Back off my grill, son!

222
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,451
Carol, what are you doing?

223
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:34,718
I'm terrified. The young people
that come off that barge...

224
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:39,639
the people I love the most,
they're in danger.

225
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:44,151
- I'm going to solve this one first.
- Not before I solve it first.

226
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:48,815
You'll look like total idiots
when you're captured and I save you.

227
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:50,605
Thank you. Marvelous.

228
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:55,318
Maybe we can celebrate later
by having a little spookapalooza.

229
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,781
Spookapalooza?

230
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:05,331
You haven't noticed anything unusual
since you started working here?

231
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:10,167
- Any weirdoes running around?
- No.

232
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:32,113
Welcome, dear victims.

233
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,200
My name is N' Goo Tuana.

234
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:40,867
This is my evil best pal, Zarkos.

235
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:45,917
You may recognize him from Telemundo
as the famous masked wrestler...

236
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,375
Zarkos.

237
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:49,915
This enchanted island...

238
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:54,299
is a thoroughfare
to the supernatural realm.

239
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:59,929
For centuries, it was home to creatures
who lived on the island undisturbed.

240
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,732
But then...

241
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,814
ten years ago...

242
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:10,611
Emile Mondevarious...

243
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:16,567
antagonized these ancient beings
by building a theme park here.

244
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:22,285
The creatures are furious, my friends.

245
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,116
And I assure you...

246
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:28,792
while you party...

247
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,921
they plot...

248
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:34,457
their revenge!

249
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,180
Do my friends frighten you?

250
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:51,566
They would, if it weren't
for the holographic projectors...

251
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:55,942
there, and there and there.

252
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,070
What a smart little one.

253
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,629
Hello, Dead Mike's.

254
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,966
We got a "Mr. Doo" here?

255
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:21,795
I got a call for a "Mr. Doo."

256
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,891
Melvin Doo?

257
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,518
No, Scooby.

258
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:31,191
- Hello?
- Got a bag...

259
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:34,861
of hamburgers here for you.

260
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,737
Just walk into the dark,
shadowy part of the forest...

261
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:41,486
where no one can see you.

262
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,157
Okay.

263
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,170
- Want a stuffed thingy?
- Nobody can win those.

264
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:55,003
Fred says it's a worthless talent, that
I should've learned French instead.

265
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:59,341
I say you don't need to know what
" Voulez-vous coucher avec moi" means...

266
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,888
to love that song.

267
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:07,184
I think being good at crane machine
is way cooler than French.

268
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,772
Voilà.

269
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:15,234
Nobody's ever given me a stuffed
dismembered head before.

270
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,050
Excuse me.

271
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:48,599
Now I have to start my voodoo ritual
all over again!

272
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:49,928
Voodoo ritual?

273
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:54,562
- I was about to sacrifice this chicken.
- That chicken's not alive.

274
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:59,110
I know. What, did you figure that out
when you saw it didn't have a head?

275
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,608
What do you want?
Why you in the voodoo ritual space?

276
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:07,912
I'm looking for clues as to who's
behind the students' strange behavior.

277
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:11,252
Here's a clue:
Purple is a fall color.

278
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:13,794
- It's the middle of May!
- Pardon?

279
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,090
Do yourself a favor
and get off this island. Go home.

280
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:21,264
Go home before evil befalls
your skinny, aerobicized booty.

281
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,295
And whatever you do...

282
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,639
do not, I repeat...

283
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:29,853
do not go into
that Spooky Island castle.

284
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:34,846
- You want me to go to that castle.
- Didn't you hear what I said?

285
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:38,402
You knew I'd do the opposite
of what you said.

286
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:41,687
You told me not to go to the castle
so I would go...

287
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:44,741
where you set a trap to capture me.

288
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:46,277
Unless...

289
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:50,120
you knew I'd figure it out,
so you told me not to go...

290
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:54,287
so I'd think you wanted me to go,
so I wouldn't go.

291
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:59,040
I'll find out what you're hiding
in that castle. You watch.

292
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,458
What in the world?

293
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:07,554
Hamburgers, where are you?

294
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,480
Hamburgers.

295
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,994
Thank you.

296
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:48,836
Shaggy!

297
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:12,531
It's been really nice.

298
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,793
Shaggy!

299
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:19,246
Monster! Monster!

300
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,038
A monster?

301
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:29,547
Scooby-Doo, quit goofing around, man.

302
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:32,218
I guess I should go.

303
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:37,271
Bye, Scooby.

304
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,227
Bless you.

305
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:48,739
Shaggy. Scooby.

306
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:56,239
No way.

307
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,920
- Scoob and me don't do castles.
- Why not?

308
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:06,205
They have paintings that watch you,
suits of armor you think is a statue...

309
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:11,132
but there's a guy inside who follows
you every time you turn around.

310
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:15,053
- How many times did that happen?
- Twelve. We're not gonna do it.

311
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,064
That's right.

312
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,096
Scooby?

313
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,647
Did you hurt your paw?

314
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:27,979
- Would you do it for a Scooby Snack?
- Oh, boy!

315
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:32,658
- And you'll be fearless?
- Fearless?

316
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,370
Hong Kong Phooey,
watch the fists of fury.

317
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:42,962
Here you go.

318
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:45,041
Thank you.

319
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:48,631
There's plenty more where that came
from. Let's go before someone sees.

320
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,047
Okay.

321
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:54,796
You're not gonna stay out here alone,
are you?

322
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:56,716
No, thank you.

323
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:09,153
Oh, boy.

324
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:14,485
This place is, like, uber creepy.

325
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:16,817
Yeah, uber creepy.

326
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:20,254
The only thing missing
is a mindless zombie.

327
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,710
Fred, get back. I found this place.
I call dibs on its clues.

328
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,720
- I've already found some clues.
- What?

329
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:37,350
I followed some weird footprints here.
It might be dangerous for you.

330
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:42,393
If anyone messes with me, I'll open
a can of Chinese whoop-ass on them.

331
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:46,354
Velma.

332
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:50,822
- What are you doing here?
- This ride was closed for construction.

333
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:56,906
It's the most likely place to hatch
a plan. And I wanted to scare Daphne.

334
00:26:57,074 --> 00:27:01,624
Since we're all together,
let's split up and look for more clues.

335
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:03,869
- Daphne, you and I...
- Typical.

336
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,289
- What?
- Nothing.

337
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,960
- I was always picked last for the teams.
- Okay.

338
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,879
Daphne, exit through the entrance.

339
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,838
Velma and I will enter
through the exit.

340
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,721
And Shaggy and Scooby...

341
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,220
do whatever you guys do.

342
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,827
Look at this, huh, Scoob?

343
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:43,405
It's like a medieval Sizzler.

344
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,960
Pinch me, I'm in heaven...

345
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:49,625
- It's an expression, Scoob.
- Sorry.

346
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:10,016
Velma, I never meant to...
Well, you know...

347
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,940
- pick you last.
- Don't worry about it.

348
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:14,614
I know you.

349
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:17,949
All you care about
are swimsuit models.

350
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:23,525
Look, I'm a man of substance.
Dorky chicks like you turn me on too.

351
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:29,961
That's a compliment.

352
00:28:58,404 --> 00:28:59,904
Yes! Yes!

353
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:01,822
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

354
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:05,079
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, no!

355
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:09,656
And now for our dinner show.

356
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,423
What?

357
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:20,344
Watch out!

358
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,934
- I got a bad feeling about this.
- Me too.

359
00:29:27,141 --> 00:29:29,771
And now for the main course:

360
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:32,346
You!

361
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:36,519
Feast on this.

362
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:47,408
Jinkies.

363
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:51,163
They're moving toward us. Run!

364
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:55,629
- We're trapped.
- Quick, try the bookcase.

365
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:59,546
- One of these has to open a passageway.
- Velma, this is a ride.

366
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,546
You got a better plan?

367
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,350
What do we do?

368
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:11,725
Do what we do best, Scoob:
Eat.

369
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,395
It's plastic.

370
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:18,935
So what? You drink out of a toilet.

371
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:21,692
So do you.

372
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:24,743
I'm not helpless.

373
00:30:24,907 --> 00:30:27,407
I am helpless. I'm gonna die!

374
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:50,774
We made it, Scoob. We're alive!

375
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:56,942
That was weird.

376
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:00,864
Fred? Freddy?

377
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,068
Are you all right?

378
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:16,751
The last book.

379
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:22,172
I don't feel so good.

380
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:26,009
Reminds me of the time we tried to eat
that guy in the hot-dog costume.

381
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:29,257
Looks like some kind of school.

382
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:32,353
In a spooky castle ride? Fishy.

383
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:57,081
Welcome to America.

384
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:59,999
I am using the language English.

385
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,668
- Shaggy, look.
- Let's check it out.

386
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:12,603
Oh, boy. Lights, camera, action,
huh, Scoob?

387
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,024
Now that you're a young adult...

388
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:18,103
you'll need to learn societal dos...

389
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,103
and don'ts.

390
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:25,532
Interaction between young
people is polite and casual.

391
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:30,873
Hey, sorry, bro.

392
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:34,116
I will crush your bones into dust.

393
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:40,922
Let's see how the situation
should be handled.

394
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:47,011
Remember, today's young people
have a language all their own.

395
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:50,886
Sorry, bro.

396
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:54,215
No big whoop, dog.
Catch that new vid on the box?

397
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:57,479
True dat. I'm up to sniznuff
on all popular trends.

398
00:32:57,643 --> 00:32:59,063
Word.

399
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,940
It seems to be a brainwashing
facility of some type.

400
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:09,237
Wherever there's a brainwashing cult,
there's always a power-hungry leader.

401
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,954
- The Papa Smurf figure.
- Mondevarious.

402
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:15,239
Then why would he have
invited us here?

403
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,962
Jellybeans.

404
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:12,168
I'll have whatever he's having.

405
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:19,562
Are you challenging me?

406
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:22,806
Maybe.

407
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:36,071
Pull my finger. Too late.

408
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,920
- You're in trouble.
- Oh, boy.

409
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:01,766
I'm not stopping
till your fur is singed off.

410
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:14,277
We're here to solve a mystery.

411
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:15,816
Yeah, Scoob.

412
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:23,161
Let's get out of here.

413
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,249
Zoinks! Skedaddle!

414
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,841
- I found a neat and scary clue.
- Us too.

415
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:39,802
This is a brainwashing
facility for an evil cult.

416
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:43,221
Maybe this is the secret relic
thingy they worship.

417
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,770
We'll all be relics if we don't
get out of here.

418
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:48,347
I got a plan.

419
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:52,022
What's that smell?

420
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:58,859
Sir, they found the Daemon Ritus.

421
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:02,616
For your sake, they better not
have gone far.

422
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:07,544
It is time to summon
the big muchachos.

423
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:10,421
Like, oh, no!

424
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:42,446
Mystery Inc. You all seem rather
cheery. Good news, I hope?

425
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:44,288
Mr. Mononucleosis...

426
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:48,868
- Yes?
- We have hit a clue smorgasbord.

427
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:53,167
We have three suspects
as to who's behind this evil hooty.

428
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:57,046
N' Goo Tuana. He believes
your park's on enchanted ground.

429
00:36:57,215 --> 00:37:01,045
The voodoo man, who tricked me
into going to the castle.

430
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:03,143
- And you.
- Me?

431
00:37:03,305 --> 00:37:06,055
Let's split up.
We'll meet in a half-hour.

432
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:09,476
I'll interview employees to see
if they've noticed anything odd.

433
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:12,694
I'll translate these inscriptions
Daphne found.

434
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:15,266
I'll go research cults on the Net.

435
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:20,395
I'm a suspect?

436
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:24,282
Don't take it personally.
It's mostly just because you creep me out.

437
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,454
I see.

438
00:37:27,704 --> 00:37:28,704
Fine.

439
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,720
Jinkies.

440
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:11,828
Hey. Your friends ditch you?

441
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:15,128
No, I always did the brainwork.

442
00:38:16,086 --> 00:38:17,586
What's this?

443
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:20,264
I believe it's called
the Daemon Ritus.

444
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:23,013
Daemon Ritus? What's it for?

445
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:26,138
This describes
an old race of creatures.

446
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:31,354
It's reminiscent of Pandaemonous texts,
so I can make some of it out.

447
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:35,848
It looks like instructions
to some sort of secret ritual.

448
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,692
It is fascinating.

449
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:39,687
On the house. Nice sweater.

450
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,189
You really dig doing this, huh?

451
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:44,412
Like, clues and stuff.

452
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:46,485
Certainly.

453
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:50,368
Really focusing on a mystery
reminds me of the old days.

454
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:54,619
We were quite a crew back then.

455
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:58,035
That was the best time of my life.

456
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:02,301
Shaggy and Scooby...
What goofballs!

457
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,465
Kind of like they are today.

458
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,465
And Daphne...

459
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:12,387
So beautiful. She was the coolest girl
at Coolsville High.

460
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:15,559
Fred. He was so handsome.

461
00:39:15,729 --> 00:39:18,309
And he really knew how to accessorize.

462
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:20,108
Sounds perfect.

463
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:23,605
Yeah, but every family has one nut.

464
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:26,158
Scrappy-Dappy-Doo!

465
00:39:26,448 --> 00:39:28,868
Ghosts don't stand a chance with me.

466
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:32,204
Let me at 'em. I'll rack 'em.
I'll sock 'em.

467
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,710
For the thousandth time,
there's no such thing as ghosts.

468
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:42,174
Sure there are. When I find them,
I'll give them a dose of puppy power!

469
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:46,014
Oh, God. He's peeing on me.

470
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:54,847
That little egomaniac
had flipped his lid.

471
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:57,978
Scrappy, I told you,
no urinating on Daphne.

472
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:00,766
- It was an accident.
- You were marking your territory.

473
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:05,150
You don't have the scrote for this job.
Listen up, losers.

474
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:09,030
The time has come to appoint me
your unquestioned leader.

475
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:12,699
Either that, or I'm out of here.

476
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:20,291
What's the idea? You can't do
this to me. People adore me.

477
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:24,585
I'm as cute as a Powerpuff Girl.
I'll get my own show.

478
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:27,879
Puppy power, huh?

479
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:32,466
And he wasn't even a puppy.
He had a gland disorder.

480
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:50,533
Help me! Help me!
Monsters! Monsters!

481
00:40:57,497 --> 00:41:00,667
This is the most embarrassing thing
you've done...

482
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:05,174
since you cleaned your beans
at Don Knotts' Christmas party.

483
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,460
How many times
do I have to tell you?

484
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:12,722
There are no such things as ghouls,
ghosts, goblins or monsters.

485
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:15,764
Now listen up. There is absolutely...

486
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:20,312
absolutely no such thing as...

487
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:24,901
Monster!

488
00:41:28,862 --> 00:41:30,402
Fred!

489
00:41:32,574 --> 00:41:34,074
Scooby...

490
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:37,740
Save Daphne.

491
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:44,876
My glasses.

492
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:47,746
I can't find my glasses.

493
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:53,011
Help me find my glasses.

494
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:56,599
Here they are.

495
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,063
Thank you.

496
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,099
Nice mask.

497
00:42:01,603 --> 00:42:03,563
Bad breath.

498
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,280
Here.

499
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:16,831
Jinkies.

500
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:20,622
Velma!

501
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,539
Come on!

502
00:42:28,338 --> 00:42:29,378
Velma!

503
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:34,382
This is, like, the opposite
of what I wanted to do today.

504
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:44,654
Leave it!

505
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,660
Stand back, sir.

506
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:56,696
I'll protect you.

507
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,290
Mr. Mondevarious!

508
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:07,997
Daphne, go!

509
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:13,506
Scooby-Doo, where are you?

510
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:33,607
Running suitcase.
Run suitcase. Run...

511
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:03,391
Thank you.

512
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:07,562
- Where's Scooby?
- I hope he's okay.

513
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:11,020
- Right here. Scooby-Dooby-Doo!
- Hey, Scoob.

514
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:22,953
Scooby!

515
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:08,583
I have a sinking feeling these dudes
aren't brainwashed cult members.

516
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:13,130
What do they want with the students?
We need to follow them.

517
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:17,421
- Say what?
- Defeat them and save Fred and Velma.

518
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:22,972
Sort of like my plan: Get out of here,
let the creatures eat Fred and Velma.

519
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:26,809
No way. Fred and Velma
always figured out everything.

520
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,644
Now it's our turn.

521
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:33,480
For the first time, they're
the damsels in distress, not me.

522
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,649
- Help?
- Timber.

523
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:50,619
- Okay, I'm calling for help.
- No. I got this. I got this.

524
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:56,169
I don't got this.

525
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:10,600
- Coast Guard, Fitzgibbon.
- Hello, sir. We're on Spooky Island.

526
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:12,850
Our friends were...

527
00:46:13,855 --> 00:46:16,725
kidnapped.
We need someone here right away.

528
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:21,531
We do have a unit in the vicinity.
Can you meet them at the pier?

529
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:24,197
All right, they'll be right there.

530
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:30,204
"Our friends have been kidnapped."

531
00:47:00,693 --> 00:47:05,413
- Something messed up is happening.
- Is the Coast Guard here?

532
00:47:05,615 --> 00:47:09,195
What happened to the shattered windows
and busted walls?

533
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:11,240
Yo, Red. The ball.

534
00:47:15,124 --> 00:47:16,834
Let's go.

535
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:34,432
Anyone else think this is strange?

536
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:39,063
- Okay, we need to split up.
- Why?

537
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:42,613
- We need to find Fred and Velma.
- I'll go this way.

538
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:45,108
And we'll go with you.

539
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:48,113
Come on, Scoob.

540
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:24,187
Fred?

541
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:29,072
Yo, the beyotch was like, "What?"
And I was like, "Later on!"

542
00:48:30,992 --> 00:48:33,542
What up, dog? And...

543
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:37,294
- dog.
- Keeping it real.

544
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:41,628
- What happened last night?
- We got beats like it was the lizz-nizz.

545
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:44,746
- You know what I'm saying, G?
- No.

546
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,877
You hear that?

547
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:58,385
Get the dog.

548
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:05,032
- Damsel in distress.
- Let go of me. Help!

549
00:49:06,861 --> 00:49:09,951
Hurry, get the door!

550
00:49:17,163 --> 00:49:20,873
- Why is Fred in a bad mood?
- He's not in a bad mood, Scoob...

551
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,383
he's a monster.

552
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,390
- Shaggy, bikes!
- I know, "yikes!"

553
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:38,679
No, bikes!

554
00:49:39,018 --> 00:49:40,518
Scoob!

555
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:02,286
Shaggy, look out!

556
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:06,999
I just saw my friend Beth Ann.
Something's wrong with her eyes.

557
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:09,133
Like, hop on!

558
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:24,347
Like, what a drag!

559
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:37,704
Like, duck!

560
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:01,273
- Yes!
- That was great!

561
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:05,935
- Are you all right? You were great.
- You too.

562
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:12,443
- Scooby, what are you doing, man?
- Mary Jane is a man in a mask.

563
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:15,663
- Mary Jane is a man in a mask?
- Scooby.

564
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:18,873
What are you doing, man?
Step off, Scoob.

565
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,116
Shaggy, you're whipped.

566
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:25,118
I'm whipped? Yeah?
Why don't you say that to my face?

567
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,962
Okay, I will.
Your mommy eats cat poop!

568
00:51:28,169 --> 00:51:30,879
No, Scooby-Doo,
your mom eats cat poop!

569
00:51:32,757 --> 00:51:35,837
Bring it.
You want a piece of the Shagster?

570
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:38,641
- Feel the pain, Scoob.
- Okay.

571
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:40,886
Come on! Two shots! Two shots!

572
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:45,098
Me and you, me and you again.
I'll give you some right now, buddy.

573
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,555
Scoob!

574
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:54,194
I gotta save him.
You stay here, I'll be right back.

575
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:56,363
No, Shaggy.

576
00:51:56,697 --> 00:51:59,197
I mean, it's too dangerous.

577
00:51:59,408 --> 00:52:03,498
I've got to. He's, like, my best pal.

578
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:06,655
Friends don't quit.

579
00:52:18,803 --> 00:52:20,303
Scoob?

580
00:52:24,183 --> 00:52:26,063
Scooby-Doo...

581
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:29,225
where are you?

582
00:52:30,231 --> 00:52:31,941
Scoob?

583
00:53:04,765 --> 00:53:07,725
Shaggy. Shaggy.

584
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:11,940
Shaggy!

585
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:15,608
Velma.

586
00:53:17,236 --> 00:53:19,146
I'll save you.

587
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:30,084
Thanks, Shaggy.
Boy, am I glad to see you.

588
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:34,091
Let me go so I can return to my body.
Get out of here...

589
00:53:34,295 --> 00:53:37,455
before they steal
your protoplasm too.

590
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:40,718
I always knew you were a hero, Shaggy.

591
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:44,471
Jinkies!

592
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:19,456
- Hey, buddy.
- Shaggy!

593
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:26,183
Someone must have spiked my root beer
last night. Talk me down, man.

594
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:29,598
Fred, you're a frigging
protoplasmic head.

595
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:33,559
I know.

596
00:54:34,021 --> 00:54:37,691
But I'm still the best-looking
protoplasmic head here.

597
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:41,861
How do you drive this?

598
00:54:42,071 --> 00:54:45,911
The Darkopalypse's upon us.
Get what you need for the ceremony.

599
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:48,736
On your right. Your left.

600
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:52,207
I'm coming, good-looking!

601
00:54:55,584 --> 00:54:59,884
- Thank you, you've saved me.
- Sorry, I'm looking for my friends.

602
00:55:00,047 --> 00:55:01,457
But...

603
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:09,718
Put me back, Shaggy.
I'll figure a way out myself.

604
00:55:10,182 --> 00:55:11,932
- Like, how?
- I don't know.

605
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:16,102
I'll use my tongue as an oar
and swim to the edge.

606
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:17,653
Sorry.

607
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:35,668
Yo, yo, you, yo.

608
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,843
What the...?

609
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:03,401
You could use a little sunlight.

610
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:19,080
That's one part of the mystery solved.

611
00:56:19,293 --> 00:56:22,843
The creatures need our bodies
to survive in sunlight.

612
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:25,549
Like a human suit.

613
00:56:25,758 --> 00:56:28,798
SPF 1,000,000.

614
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:33,223
But what are they doing here
in the first place?

615
00:56:35,267 --> 00:56:37,557
Daphne, you okay?

616
00:56:38,479 --> 00:56:39,979
Yeah.

617
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:43,317
- But I'm not Daphne!
- Fred?

618
00:56:49,907 --> 00:56:53,987
I couldn't get to my body.
I didn't know where else to go.

619
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:57,461
It's not easy to steer
when you're pure spirit.

620
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:03,671
I can look at myself naked.

621
00:57:03,879 --> 00:57:05,209
Oh, brother.

622
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:16,267
- Get your hands off me.
- Daphne?

623
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:21,055
- He planned this somehow, didn't he?
- Hey, good-looking.

624
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:24,361
Fred, you egocentric...

625
00:57:24,525 --> 00:57:27,935
- Please tell me you guys are you.
- Fred keeps touching me.

626
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:31,533
Makes you nostalgic
for the homicidal creatures.

627
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,490
I stole this. I hope it helps.

628
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:36,951
The Daemon Ritus.

629
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:46,303
- I'm me again.
- Yippee for you.

630
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:50,045
Man, like, why am I wearing a dress?

631
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:54,177
Everyone remain calm.
Velma, what the heck's going on?

632
00:57:54,388 --> 00:57:56,218
If I am correct...

633
00:57:56,431 --> 00:58:01,021
due to the instability of protoplasm
in the proximity of the Daemon Ritus...

634
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:05,308
we're going to continue
randomly changing bodies until...

635
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:07,483
Jinkies!

636
00:58:08,944 --> 00:58:12,114
Until the protoplasm realigns
with the appropriate bodies.

637
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:14,072
I'm Fred again!

638
00:58:14,283 --> 00:58:18,833
Daph, what's wrong with you?
Don't you ever eat?

639
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:25,751
I'm me.

640
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,919
- I'm back.
- Like, me too.

641
00:58:28,088 --> 00:58:29,918
Told you so.

642
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:33,511
- Oh, no.
- Let's go.

643
00:58:37,139 --> 00:58:39,809
I guess that was the wrong ingredient.

644
00:58:40,434 --> 00:58:41,814
Wait.

645
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,602
I know how to handle this guy.

646
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:47,401
Hey, you! What're you doing?

647
00:58:47,608 --> 00:58:50,228
Yes. That is masterful.

648
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:54,784
I'm doing a voodoo ritual.
I need to get the right ingredients.

649
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:59,158
The only way to protect myself is
by blessing this dead Arnouki beast.

650
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:03,749
They're about to perform
their evil Darkopalypse ritual.

651
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:06,127
- Darkopalypse ritual?
- Right.

652
00:59:06,335 --> 00:59:09,995
- That's what the ancient text describes.
- Don't open that!

653
00:59:10,214 --> 00:59:13,934
They use the protoplasm
in the vat as an energy source.

654
00:59:14,635 --> 00:59:19,425
And the leader needs to absorb a purely
good soul to complete the ritual.

655
00:59:19,598 --> 00:59:22,638
Legend has it,
once the ritual is performed...

656
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:26,689
the creatures will rule on Earth
for 10,000 years.

657
00:59:26,855 --> 00:59:30,395
That's why I have this in my house.
To protect myself.

658
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,027
You have another one of those?

659
00:59:33,195 --> 00:59:37,655
Those creatures are taking over
the world? That is so mean.

660
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:42,584
They can't do the ritual without a pure
human soul. Where will they get one?

661
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:45,916
I didn't say human.

662
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:47,713
Oh, boy.

663
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:08,230
Hello, puppy.

664
01:00:08,397 --> 01:00:11,687
If the person behind all this
needs Scooby-Doo...

665
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:14,988
Then that person is the one
who brought Scooby here.

666
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:24,373
Scoobert. How are you, my friend?
Sit down, please.

667
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:26,038
Okay.

668
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:30,208
Scooby Snack?

669
01:00:30,377 --> 01:00:32,377
Maybe one.

670
01:00:36,675 --> 01:00:39,175
We'll need some more of those.

671
01:00:40,387 --> 01:00:42,597
That's me!

672
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:47,184
It certainly is.
And that's because... why?

673
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:50,862
We love you, Scooby-Doo.

674
01:00:51,023 --> 01:00:55,073
Unlike that alleged friend
of yours, Shaggy.

675
01:00:55,902 --> 01:01:01,622
He wouldn't believe you about
that nasty girl Mary Jane, would he?

676
01:01:02,242 --> 01:01:03,782
No.

677
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:07,408
But I believe you, my friend.

678
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:12,541
And that's why I've got
a very important job for you.

679
01:01:12,711 --> 01:01:14,251
What's that?

680
01:01:14,421 --> 01:01:18,261
That's a cat with a bobbing head.
Please don't touch it.

681
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:22,393
Scooby, I would like you...

682
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:26,604
to be a sacrifice.

683
01:01:26,767 --> 01:01:29,137
A sacrifice?

684
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:36,074
If Mondorajagaga wanted Scooby,
why'd he invite the rest of us?

685
01:01:36,234 --> 01:01:39,454
It doesn't matter.
We gotta, like, go save Scoob.

686
01:01:39,613 --> 01:01:43,373
Our area of expertise is nut jobs
in Halloween costumes.

687
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,703
We're supposed to be heroes, man.

688
01:01:47,245 --> 01:01:50,495
So I'm gonna do what I always do:

689
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:55,415
I'm gonna eat myself a Scooby Snack,
and I'm gonna save my best pal.

690
01:01:57,589 --> 01:01:59,379
Velmster?

691
01:01:59,758 --> 01:02:04,848
You think I'm gonna fall for that?
Giving me my own nickname?

692
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:08,430
Trying to make me feel like...

693
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,140
part of the gang?

694
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:15,440
We could make a plan.

695
01:02:15,607 --> 01:02:19,737
What can I do? The only thing
I'm good for is getting caught.

696
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:22,363
But you never let that
stop you before.

697
01:02:22,531 --> 01:02:26,281
And if that's not a true hero,
then I don't know what is.

698
01:02:36,378 --> 01:02:39,508
Let's get jinkie with it.

699
01:03:11,163 --> 01:03:16,003
Okay, so we use the pulleys
to tip over the vat.

700
01:03:16,168 --> 01:03:19,918
Daphne will open the air vents
and release the disco skull.

701
01:03:20,088 --> 01:03:22,168
The light will refract off the skull...

702
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:27,470
The creatures will explode, I'll find
Scoob, and we'll have saved the world.

703
01:03:28,388 --> 01:03:31,138
Oh, no. The ritual's beginning.

704
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:33,808
Quick. Shaggy, attach this to the vat.

705
01:03:42,611 --> 01:03:44,781
We're here to save you.

706
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:46,566
Shaggy, faster.

707
01:03:47,032 --> 01:03:48,532
All systems go.

708
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:50,575
Wait, no!

709
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:52,754
Mystery Inc. Rides again.

710
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:25,994
Quick, hide the Daemon Ritus.

711
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:40,502
Would you like another Scooby Snack?

712
01:04:41,044 --> 01:04:42,464
Okay.

713
01:04:42,671 --> 01:04:44,631
Scooby-Doo!

714
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:04,923
Yo, yo, yo. Yo, homedogs.

715
01:06:05,086 --> 01:06:07,416
You forgot the next part
of the dance...

716
01:06:07,589 --> 01:06:10,839
where we do the Electric Slide,
you know...

717
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:23,103
Hurry up, Velma.

718
01:06:23,271 --> 01:06:24,811
Fred, Velma...

719
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:29,031
welcome to my little
end-of-the-world party.

720
01:06:29,194 --> 01:06:32,494
I've waited a long time
for this moment.

721
01:06:32,656 --> 01:06:37,236
Thank you for returning
the ultimate party favor:

722
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:40,200
The Daemon Ritus.

723
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:46,628
And now, behold the sacrifice.

724
01:06:48,088 --> 01:06:51,338
Thank you. Thank you.

725
01:06:51,508 --> 01:06:54,048
Hello, thank you.

726
01:06:56,096 --> 01:06:58,096
Thank you. Shaggy?

727
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:59,931
Scoobert.

728
01:07:01,309 --> 01:07:04,309
Let's run for it.
We, like, gotta get out of here.

729
01:07:04,688 --> 01:07:07,478
- I'm a sacrifice. Hello.
- A sacrifice?

730
01:07:07,649 --> 01:07:09,819
Dude, that's not a good thing, Scoob.

731
01:07:15,949 --> 01:07:17,779
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

732
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:22,751
And I'm sorry I haven't been
a very good friend since we got here.

733
01:07:22,914 --> 01:07:26,044
- But you gotta trust me now.
- You don't trust me.

734
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:31,629
I do trust you.
Now, look. Who's your best buddy?

735
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:34,219
- Shaggy.
- Right.

736
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:36,394
And who's my best buddy?

737
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:39,350
- Scooby-Doo?
- That's right.

738
01:07:39,514 --> 01:07:44,774
You are. And we're like two trippy peas
in a far-out pod, man.

739
01:07:45,353 --> 01:07:48,733
Best buddies trust each other.
Let's do what we do best.

740
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:53,318
Let's run out of here screaming
in fear like two lunatics, okay?

741
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:56,526
On the count of...
Let's make it five. One.

742
01:07:57,574 --> 01:07:59,164
Two.

743
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:08,541
Hey, look at me!

744
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:22,559
The moment is at hand.

745
01:08:22,724 --> 01:08:28,194
Through the Daemon Ritus,
I shall absorb the energy source.

746
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:41,071
And now, to complete
the transformation...

747
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:44,042
I shall absorb the pure one.

748
01:08:44,204 --> 01:08:45,204
Scoob.

749
01:08:46,498 --> 01:08:50,878
Ultimate power shall be mine!

750
01:08:51,044 --> 01:08:53,804
Nobody absorbs my pal!

751
01:09:07,018 --> 01:09:09,098
Come on!

752
01:09:11,523 --> 01:09:14,073
I'm free!

753
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:16,740
Look at me!

754
01:09:16,903 --> 01:09:18,903
Get him!

755
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:23,237
Let's get the Daemon Ritus.

756
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:25,789
Get off my pincer!

757
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:36,088
Cowabunga!

758
01:09:41,928 --> 01:09:46,138
Look, Velms. A man in a mask.

759
01:09:50,937 --> 01:09:55,647
We love you, Scooby-Doo. We love you.

760
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:59,490
That alleged friend of yours, Shaggy.

761
01:09:59,654 --> 01:10:01,414
I shall absorb...

762
01:10:04,784 --> 01:10:08,834
Puppy power! I've outsmarted...

763
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:13,134
Scrappy-Doo.

764
01:10:13,293 --> 01:10:17,173
Correction.
The new, improved Scrappy.

765
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:23,548
Because I, Scrappy-Dappy-Doo,
have absorbed enough energy...

766
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:29,270
to rule the world
with my all-powerful army!

767
01:10:30,184 --> 01:10:35,234
And I've brought you here,
puny, pathetic Mystery Inc...

768
01:10:35,398 --> 01:10:39,358
to witness my moment of triumph.

769
01:10:39,527 --> 01:10:44,487
All I need to complete
my transformation is Scooby-Doo.

770
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:49,489
Me? Don't you mean Melvin Doo?

771
01:10:49,662 --> 01:10:51,202
Seize them!

772
01:10:51,372 --> 01:10:54,292
Like, let's get out of here!

773
01:10:55,543 --> 01:10:57,843
Take that, pretty boy!

774
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:16,560
This is totally un-groovy, Scoob.

775
01:11:16,731 --> 01:11:20,781
Scooby-Doo, where are you?

776
01:11:36,876 --> 01:11:41,376
Yield to my puppy power!

777
01:11:41,965 --> 01:11:44,545
- We gotta tip over the protoplasm vat.
- How?

778
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:47,257
The pincer. Come on.

779
01:11:52,016 --> 01:11:56,476
You all need to step back,
because Fredster's got his groove on.

780
01:12:15,248 --> 01:12:19,578
Got you! You look
so much bigger on TV.

781
01:12:30,638 --> 01:12:33,218
- Shaggy!
- Scoob.

782
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:35,726
You're done!

783
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:48,611
Come back here, you lazy beatnik.

784
01:12:49,323 --> 01:12:50,413
Shaggy.

785
01:12:55,705 --> 01:12:57,865
- Crud.
- Told you so.

786
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:05,956
Like, wow!

787
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:08,970
Give me the dog!

788
01:13:10,094 --> 01:13:13,854
Scrappy, down! Sit! Bad Scrappy!

789
01:13:23,149 --> 01:13:27,569
Let's finish this puppy! Now!

790
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:29,317
Not again.

791
01:13:30,031 --> 01:13:32,701
Captured again, señorita?

792
01:13:32,867 --> 01:13:36,697
Not this time!

793
01:13:55,014 --> 01:13:57,774
- Now who's the damsel in distress?
- Me?

794
01:13:58,267 --> 01:13:59,677
Straight up.

795
01:14:35,972 --> 01:14:39,182
Mystery Inc., this ain't over!

796
01:14:39,517 --> 01:14:42,437
Not by a long shot!

797
01:14:43,646 --> 01:14:47,186
I'll rock you and sock you...

798
01:14:47,358 --> 01:14:49,858
and crush you like...

799
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:53,066
- Like, dude?
- What?

800
01:14:53,239 --> 01:14:56,659
You're a bad puppy!

801
01:15:10,965 --> 01:15:16,005
Come on, I can still take you.
Put them up, you mangy mutt.

802
01:15:16,179 --> 01:15:18,719
Is that all you got?

803
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:33,858
Hey, Daph!

804
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:38,950
- We did it!
- Yes, we did.

805
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:51,671
Fred! Cut it out.

806
01:16:07,855 --> 01:16:11,015
- Mr. Mondevarious, is that you?
- Yes.

807
01:16:11,192 --> 01:16:14,242
Oh, thank goodness!
Thank you! Thank you!

808
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:16,533
Velma! Thank you!

809
01:16:21,661 --> 01:16:25,001
You're fogging up my glasses.

810
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:30,455
Two years ago, that little pest...

811
01:16:30,628 --> 01:16:33,798
turns up at a casting session
for our evil elves.

812
01:16:33,965 --> 01:16:36,165
Next thing I know,
I'm stuck in a hole...

813
01:16:36,342 --> 01:16:40,352
and he's cavorting about
in a mechanical version of me.

814
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:44,353
But look, thank you so much.

815
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:49,810
What a delight. Fantastic!
Fantastic!

816
01:16:51,524 --> 01:16:54,284
- Shaggy!
- Scooby-Doo!

817
01:17:00,366 --> 01:17:02,026
I love you, Shaggy.

818
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:04,161
I love you too, Scoob.

819
01:17:04,328 --> 01:17:07,038
Now get off me, buddy.

820
01:17:10,835 --> 01:17:14,205
Thanks. You saved my life.

821
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:16,550
Like, no problem.

822
01:17:24,223 --> 01:17:26,683
And thank you, Scooby-Doo.

823
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:31,439
- My little schmookem-wookem.
- Shucks.

824
01:17:56,422 --> 01:18:00,092
Fred, can you tell us
how you solved the case?

825
01:18:00,259 --> 01:18:04,849
It all started when I was giving
a speech on my new book and...

826
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:12,274
And I think the Velmster
should take it from here.

827
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:15,770
Go.

828
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:23,778
Through the combined
intuitive powers of Mystery Inc...

829
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:30,289
we've discovered the real villain
is, in fact, Scrappy Cornelius Doo...

830
01:18:30,456 --> 01:18:33,286
who sadly was corrupted
by the power of the Daemon Ritus.

831
01:18:33,459 --> 01:18:36,709
Get over it!
So I got a little cranky.

832
01:18:36,879 --> 01:18:41,259
It's no reason to freak out like a jerk
and try to kill all of humanity.

833
01:18:41,425 --> 01:18:45,045
I would've gotten away with it too,
if not for you meddling sons of...

834
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:47,641
Now that Mystery Inc.
Is back together...

835
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:51,057
any comment on the Mud Bog Ghoul
who's been terrorizing London?

836
01:18:51,227 --> 01:18:53,977
Whatever the case,
Mystery Inc. Will be there.

837
01:18:54,146 --> 01:18:55,646
Solving mysteries, man.

838
01:18:55,981 --> 01:19:00,191
- Righting wrongs.
- Looking for clues and kicking butt.

839
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:20,300
How groovy is this, man?

840
01:19:20,464 --> 01:19:24,684
Spooky Island finally came through
with its all-you-can-eat deal.

841
01:19:24,885 --> 01:19:30,345
And there's nobody I'd rather
gorge myself with than you, Scooby-Doo.

842
01:19:30,516 --> 01:19:33,686
- My best friend.
- You're my best friend, buddy.

843
01:19:34,019 --> 01:19:38,189
You're beautiful like a beautiful
piece of pizza.

844
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:47,120
Zoinks! Them peppers is, like, hot.

845
01:19:47,575 --> 01:19:50,735
- Wimp.
- Wimp? You think you can handle it?

846
01:19:50,911 --> 01:19:55,211
Why don't you put your mouth
where your mouth is?

847
01:19:58,669 --> 01:20:00,169
Okay.

848
01:20:09,722 --> 01:20:13,812
Scooby-Doo, you feeling okay?

849
01:20:29,950 --> 01:20:31,490
Here you go, dude.

850
01:20:40,544 --> 01:20:43,304
- Like, how'd that taste, man?
- Delicious.

851
01:20:43,464 --> 01:20:45,924
Well, let's get two more.

852
01:20:51,305 --> 01:20:56,935
On the count of three.
One, two, three!

853
01:26:31,436 --> 01:26:33,436
