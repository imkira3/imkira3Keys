00:04:28,617 --> 00:04:30,617
Piece of cake.

3
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:35,860
That locks it?

4
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,381
Yep. Centuries of Thai history
safe as Fort Knox.

5
00:04:40,882 --> 00:04:42,882
Watch.

6
00:04:44,846 --> 00:04:47,481
Now, relax, I'm a professional.

7
00:04:56,862 --> 00:04:59,891
Okay, now your servers are down
because of a power surge...

8
00:04:59,991 --> 00:05:03,816
...or a grid malfunction
or maybe even a bomb.

9
00:05:04,496 --> 00:05:09,820
Now, if an intruder tries to reboot
your servers or access the data,

10
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,715
he'll always get this screen.

11
00:05:12,799 --> 00:05:16,303
Now, this is your BIOS level password.

12
00:05:16,387 --> 00:05:19,617
Without it,
nothing works in this room.

13
00:05:20,142 --> 00:05:22,142
Okay.

14
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:26,149
You memorized.
- Always. Just in case.

15
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,769
See?
- Good.

16
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:36,869
All right.

17
00:05:37,247 --> 00:05:39,627
When do lights come back on?

18
00:05:40,501 --> 00:05:42,501
Right.

19
00:05:43,005 --> 00:05:46,490
You're gonna have to call an electrician.

20
00:06:12,835 --> 00:06:14,835
Hi.
- Yes, Mr. Peterson.

21
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:17,966
Hi. Yes, my flight's tomorrow.

22
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:21,762
Global Skies flight 4400 departing at 4:00.

23
00:06:21,846 --> 00:06:24,083
Would you like me to arrange a taxi?

24
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:25,210
Yes, please.

25
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,690
And you have a package, sir.

26
00:07:26,765 --> 00:07:29,001
And welcome back to the broadcast.

27
00:07:29,101 --> 00:07:32,381
Today in the US Congress,
debate continues to rage...

28
00:07:32,481 --> 00:07:35,510
...over a controversial security funding bill.

29
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:39,556
If passed, the measure,
known as Senate Bill 2330,

30
00:07:39,656 --> 00:07:41,141
would authorize the NSA...

31
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:44,771
...to upgrade its current surveillance
technology worldwide.

32
00:07:44,871 --> 00:07:46,871
In other news...

33
00:07:55,719 --> 00:07:58,707
Hi. What kind of special rates
do you have this weekend?

34
00:07:58,807 --> 00:08:02,420
We're offering a half-price rate, sir.
- Really?

35
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,382
Okay, book me for one more night,
and could you please...

36
00:08:05,482 --> 00:08:06,717
Shall I rebook your flight with Global Skies?

37
00:08:06,817 --> 00:08:10,680
That's right. Global Skies flight 4400
but leaving on Saturday instead.

38
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,683
No problem, Mr. Peterson.
Enjoy your stay.

39
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,783
Thanks a lot.

40
00:08:50,165 --> 00:08:51,984
And in the US Congress today,

41
00:08:52,084 --> 00:08:56,239
controversial Senate Bill 2330
failed by a single vote.

42
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:00,411
NSA Director Raymond Burke,
an outspoken advocate for the upgrade,

43
00:09:00,511 --> 00:09:02,581
was not available for comment.

44
00:09:02,681 --> 00:09:05,543
And we're getting breaking news now
out of Bangkok, Thailand.

45
00:09:05,643 --> 00:09:08,296
It seems Global Skies flight 4400...

46
00:09:08,396 --> 00:09:12,010
...has crashed in a small town
outside Bangkok shortly after takeoff.

47
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:15,306
All 126 passengers were killed instantly.

48
00:09:15,406 --> 00:09:17,850
No word yet as to
what might have caused the crash...

49
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:20,585
...of Global Skies flight 4400.

50
00:09:33,721 --> 00:09:36,542
Hey. Thank your manager
for his innovative advertising.

51
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:39,228
It was a lifesaver, literally.

52
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,312
Advertising, sir?

53
00:09:41,356 --> 00:09:43,356
The text message?

54
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:46,555
I'm not familiar
with our promotional techniques, sir,

55
00:09:46,655 --> 00:09:49,800
but I'll pass your compliments along.

56
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:15,829
No, the sender field was blank.
Look, I'm looking right at it.

57
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,860
Unknown sender.

58
00:10:19,155 --> 00:10:22,045
What do you mean 'unknown sender'?

59
00:10:22,994 --> 00:10:26,607
Okay, can you put a trace on it
or something?

60
00:10:26,707 --> 00:10:28,707
Why not?

61
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:36,203
The biggest news on Wall Street today
was the skyrocketing Syzor,

62
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:39,499
which, by market close, had more than
tripled its value at opening bell.

63
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:44,359
If you own Syzor shares,
you're a happy investor tonight.

64
00:10:47,358 --> 00:10:49,358
Checking out.

65
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:54,240
Did you have a nice stay with us, sir?
- Yes, thanks.

66
00:10:58,539 --> 00:11:01,939
You're all set, sir. Have a nice flight.

67
00:11:03,588 --> 00:11:05,628
Is something wrong, sir?

68
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:11,960
I think I need you to change my flight again.

69
00:11:30,581 --> 00:11:32,621
Sir, do you need a ride?

70
00:11:33,085 --> 00:11:36,864
Taxis sit in traffic to pad meter.
My town car is flat â‚¬20.

71
00:11:36,964 --> 00:11:42,064
Yeah, I don't know...
- Sir, how can you not trust this face?

72
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,640
All right. Where to?

73
00:11:51,024 --> 00:11:54,277
My name is Yuri. I am from Moscow.

74
00:11:54,362 --> 00:11:57,448
Where are you from?
- United States.

75
00:11:58,283 --> 00:12:00,283
American.

76
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,399
What hotel are you staying in?

77
00:12:03,499 --> 00:12:05,751
The Empire.
- Good hotel.

78
00:12:07,963 --> 00:12:09,965
Is that a GZT 650?

79
00:12:11,175 --> 00:12:12,870
I'm sorry, what?

80
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:16,974
Your mobile. Your phone.
GPS capability, UMTS.

81
00:12:17,058 --> 00:12:21,138
Hasn't hit the streets yet.
Where did you get it?

82
00:12:21,272 --> 00:12:23,774
It was a gift.
- Good gift.

83
00:12:25,653 --> 00:12:30,408
If you need accessories,
earpiece, charger, let me know.

84
00:12:30,492 --> 00:12:32,395
Driving job just part-time.

85
00:12:32,495 --> 00:12:36,575
I can unlock phone, anything you need.
Small fee.

86
00:13:15,008 --> 00:13:17,260
All set, sir?
- Yeah.

87
00:13:17,887 --> 00:13:20,182
And how will you be paying?

88
00:13:25,523 --> 00:13:28,525
You know what? Make that a suite.

89
00:13:28,777 --> 00:13:30,429
I've already spoken with DHL.

90
00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:33,015
They said that the package came
from your mail order house.

91
00:13:33,115 --> 00:13:34,809
That's correct.
I'm not denying that, sir.

92
00:13:34,909 --> 00:13:36,311
Okay, yeah,
I know you're not denying that.

93
00:13:36,411 --> 00:13:38,732
I'm just trying to figure out
who paid for the item that you sent me.

94
00:13:38,832 --> 00:13:41,359
I'm not allowed to disclose that.
- Why can't you disclose it?

95
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:45,824
It's strict company policy to protect
our clients' privacy rights, sir.

96
00:13:45,924 --> 00:13:47,924
I'll call you back.

97
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:49,879
Hey, how you doing?

98
00:14:50,299 --> 00:14:54,579
I was wondering if I could play this slot.
I'm superstitious about this number.

99
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:59,354
Sorry, I'm keeping this one warm
for my wife over there.

100
00:15:01,855 --> 00:15:03,855
I'll give you â‚¬20.

101
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:12,899
Okay, okay, 40. You can pocket 20
and you can give the rest to your wife.

102
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,246
â‚¬100.

103
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:18,667
Okay.

104
00:15:53,172 --> 00:15:55,172
Hey.

105
00:16:01,725 --> 00:16:04,602
Sir. Better take a look at this.

106
00:16:07,691 --> 00:16:08,968
What do you got?

107
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:11,137
This guy paid for that guy's seat at the slot,

108
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:13,823
then hit us for â‚¬100,000.

109
00:16:13,907 --> 00:16:16,561
Like he knew the machine would pay off.

110
00:16:16,661 --> 00:16:19,211
Send up his stats.
- Profiling.

111
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:25,323
Hotel guest, Max Peterson.
Arrived today from Bangkok.

112
00:16:25,423 --> 00:16:28,216
American citizen, born in Omaha.

113
00:16:28,301 --> 00:16:30,301
Is he in our books?

114
00:16:32,307 --> 00:16:36,642
He's a ghost.
Nothing in our database or Interpol's.

115
00:16:37,438 --> 00:16:40,073
Well, let's keep an eye on him.

116
00:16:41,318 --> 00:16:44,378
For you, sir. Well done.
- Thank you.

117
00:16:59,175 --> 00:17:01,470
Cash or chips, sir?
- Chips.

118
00:17:13,193 --> 00:17:15,193
Zoom in on him there.

119
00:17:23,123 --> 00:17:24,482
Get you anything?

120
00:17:24,582 --> 00:17:28,322
Ginger ale.
You know, make that Scotch, neat.

121
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:40,018
Your bets, please. Sir.

122
00:18:09,308 --> 00:18:11,308
That's 100,000.

123
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,060
Good luck.

124
00:18:23,075 --> 00:18:25,075
Blackjack.

125
00:18:30,501 --> 00:18:32,501
Play that again.

126
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:37,718
All right, stop it there. Zoom in.

127
00:18:38,971 --> 00:18:41,765
Son-of-a-bitch. It's his phone.

128
00:18:43,852 --> 00:18:45,852
Send in Martin.

129
00:18:48,316 --> 00:18:51,206
Could you hold on to these for me?

130
00:18:56,244 --> 00:18:59,330
Mobiles are forbidden in casino.

131
00:19:03,836 --> 00:19:05,836
There. Happy?

132
00:19:37,505 --> 00:19:38,908
Yuri.

133
00:19:39,008 --> 00:19:43,343
Hey, this is Max Peterson.
You picked me up earlier.

134
00:19:44,055 --> 00:19:46,558
Max with the GZT 650.
- Right.

135
00:19:46,892 --> 00:19:47,960
I need your help.

136
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:51,965
I need to be able to read text messages
without looking at my phone.

137
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,051
Why?

138
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:56,138
Cell phones aren't allowed in the casino.

139
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:59,309
You want to cheat?
- No. No, no, no, no, no.

140
00:19:59,409 --> 00:20:02,871
It's my mother.
She needs to contact me.

141
00:20:02,955 --> 00:20:07,460
Your mother. Okay, I hook you up. â‚¬500.

142
00:20:07,544 --> 00:20:10,839
500? Hey, hey, I'll call RadioShack.

143
00:20:10,923 --> 00:20:13,898
No RadioShack in Prague. Only Yuri.

144
00:20:14,261 --> 00:20:16,261
I hook you up. Bye-bye.

145
00:20:26,235 --> 00:20:29,210
Kamila, where are you going?
- Home.

146
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,615
Where do you think I'm...

147
00:20:36,165 --> 00:20:38,541
Kamila, come back.
- Let go.

148
00:20:38,626 --> 00:20:39,903
Please, please, please.
Just one more drink.

149
00:20:40,003 --> 00:20:41,613
One more drink.
- I said I am leaving.

150
00:20:41,713 --> 00:20:43,574
Stay.
- I said I'm going home.

151
00:20:43,674 --> 00:20:45,674
Kamila.

152
00:20:46,887 --> 00:20:49,374
Hey, she said leave her alone, okay?
- Piss off.

153
00:20:49,474 --> 00:20:51,600
Hey. Just let her go.

154
00:21:43,627 --> 00:21:45,627
Are you okay?

155
00:21:47,424 --> 00:21:49,424
Are you okay?

156
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,220
Yeah.

157
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:55,292
Here, let me help you up.

158
00:21:55,392 --> 00:21:57,392
Okay.

159
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,225
I am so sorry.
I didn't know he was like that.

160
00:22:05,573 --> 00:22:07,616
No, it's okay.

161
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,312
He's gone, right?

162
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,412
Yeah, security.

163
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:14,582
I'm Kamila, by the way.

164
00:22:16,629 --> 00:22:18,839
Max.
- Hey, Max.

165
00:22:18,924 --> 00:22:21,201
You're American. Long way from home.

166
00:22:21,301 --> 00:22:25,515
Yeah. I'm just here
doing a little gambling, so...

167
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:28,149
Yeah? How's that treating you?

168
00:22:28,602 --> 00:22:30,602
Better now.

169
00:22:38,448 --> 00:22:40,351
Okay. Can you excuse me just one...

170
00:22:40,451 --> 00:22:42,451
Okay.

171
00:22:42,704 --> 00:22:44,690
Hello?
- It's Yuri. Meet me in the parking lot.

172
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:47,170
Yeah, see, now's a bad time.

173
00:22:50,881 --> 00:22:55,872
I've gotta go downstairs for a minute,
but maybe I can buy you a drink later?

174
00:22:55,972 --> 00:22:59,202
I really should be going, so...
- Okay.

175
00:23:02,605 --> 00:23:05,240
Thank you again for helping me.

176
00:23:10,865 --> 00:23:12,865
Can I see you again?

177
00:23:16,415 --> 00:23:18,415
I'll call you here.

178
00:23:22,339 --> 00:23:24,339
Good night.

179
00:23:25,467 --> 00:23:27,913
All right, where are they coming from?

180
00:23:28,013 --> 00:23:31,073
According to his service provider...

181
00:23:33,687 --> 00:23:35,422
There's no record of his text messages.

182
00:23:35,522 --> 00:23:37,522
How is that possible?

183
00:23:38,067 --> 00:23:40,067
Technically, it isn't.

184
00:23:48,247 --> 00:23:51,208
Hey.
- Hi. Give me your phone.

185
00:23:51,835 --> 00:23:53,835
All right.

186
00:24:00,555 --> 00:24:05,485
What are you doing?
- Bluetooth text-to-speech transmitter.

187
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:13,319
It's kickass.

188
00:24:14,031 --> 00:24:16,031
Mother, huh?

189
00:24:18,745 --> 00:24:20,745
Bet all.

190
00:24:21,957 --> 00:24:25,336
No sender on SMS. Very sophisticated.

191
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,756
Who gives gift like this?

192
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:30,758
I'm not really sure.

193
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:33,707
Hey, you think you could maybe
figure out who sent those?

194
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:38,312
Not here. Only back in Moscow.
- Really? Why not here?

195
00:24:38,771 --> 00:24:42,802
In Moscow, I have equipment,
connections, can find out anything.

196
00:24:42,902 --> 00:24:46,114
Yeah, but I can't go to Moscow.

197
00:24:47,199 --> 00:24:49,834
You change mind, you have card.

198
00:24:53,874 --> 00:24:56,934
Thanks, Yuri.
- You forget something?

199
00:25:04,847 --> 00:25:08,502
Pleasure doing business.
Say 'Hi' to Mother.

200
00:25:09,812 --> 00:25:12,231
Castle slot. East wing.

201
00:25:17,697 --> 00:25:19,697
He's back.

202
00:25:20,701 --> 00:25:22,395
All right, where's he headed?

203
00:25:22,495 --> 00:25:25,164
East wing.
- East wing.

204
00:25:29,171 --> 00:25:31,714
Maximum bet on next pull.

205
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,100
Shit.

206
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,260
Yes.

207
00:26:15,898 --> 00:26:17,898
Hold it right there.

208
00:26:17,942 --> 00:26:20,067
Don't let that guy leave.

209
00:26:22,072 --> 00:26:24,072
Shit.

210
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:05,613
Max Peterson,
I'm Special Agent Grant of the FBI.

211
00:27:05,713 --> 00:27:08,433
Put your hands behind your back.

212
00:27:08,465 --> 00:27:10,465
Now.

213
00:27:19,022 --> 00:27:21,022
Grant?

214
00:27:22,985 --> 00:27:25,025
What are you doing here?

215
00:27:25,614 --> 00:27:27,766
Look, I don't care what this guy did,
all right?

216
00:27:27,866 --> 00:27:30,228
He ripped us off, he stays here.
- He comes with us.

217
00:27:30,328 --> 00:27:33,232
I'm not in the Bureau anymore.
All right? You don't give me orders.

218
00:27:33,332 --> 00:27:36,987
I don't have to.
We're taking Sunshine here.

219
00:27:39,632 --> 00:27:43,797
Yeah, well,
it's good to see you're still a prick.

220
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:46,429
Nice tie.

221
00:28:27,276 --> 00:28:28,469
Tell me about the phone.

222
00:28:28,569 --> 00:28:31,390
Look, I didn't know.
Whatever it is, I'm really sorry.

223
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:33,268
Okay, I'll get you started.

224
00:28:33,368 --> 00:28:38,723
You bought it online with the credit card
of one Stuart Wallace.

225
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:44,490
Then you came here
and you used it to rob a casino.

226
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,452
How am I doing so far?
- I swear to God,

227
00:28:46,552 --> 00:28:47,786
I don't know what you're talking about,
all right?

228
00:28:47,886 --> 00:28:50,776
This phone came to me in the mail.

229
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,670
Who are you working with,
Mr. Peterson?

230
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:56,006
Oh, my God, nobody.

231
00:28:56,106 --> 00:28:59,846
Look, I don't know
what you're talking about.

232
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,279
I'll make it easy.

233
00:29:03,907 --> 00:29:06,243
Yuri Malinin.

234
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,290
A known hacker from Moscow.

235
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:15,573
We have a tape of you and him
exchanging equipment.

236
00:29:15,673 --> 00:29:18,076
No, no, no, no.
Look, I just met him today.

237
00:29:18,176 --> 00:29:19,662
He picked me up from the airport, okay?

238
00:29:19,762 --> 00:29:21,038
Who's sending the messages?

239
00:29:21,138 --> 00:29:25,643
I told you, I don't know, okay?
I got a package and...

240
00:29:29,316 --> 00:29:32,052
You know, no one knows you're here.

241
00:29:32,152 --> 00:29:34,654
Who's sending the messages?

242
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:39,562
Look, I swear.
You gotta believe me, I don't know.

243
00:29:39,662 --> 00:29:41,957
Who's sending the messages?

244
00:29:41,998 --> 00:29:43,998
Please, I don't know.

245
00:29:58,103 --> 00:29:59,672
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God,
just, no, don't.

246
00:29:59,772 --> 00:30:01,772
Bye, Sunshine.
- No.

247
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:14,855
I don't know who sent the messages, okay?

248
00:30:16,085 --> 00:30:18,085
You know what?

249
00:30:19,881 --> 00:30:21,881
I believe you.

250
00:30:44,204 --> 00:30:48,026
Still resourceful, I see.
- This is my town, remember?

251
00:30:48,126 --> 00:30:51,572
Have a seat. Can we get you
something? Cappuccino?

252
00:30:51,672 --> 00:30:54,367
What are you doing here, Dave?
We clean our own house.

253
00:30:54,467 --> 00:30:56,829
This is bigger than your house, John.

254
00:30:56,929 --> 00:30:59,041
You think I'd fly here and pull the strings...

255
00:30:59,141 --> 00:31:02,711
...to conduct this operation if it wasn't?

256
00:31:04,772 --> 00:31:07,384
All right.
Well, then, how about you clue me in?

257
00:31:07,484 --> 00:31:13,944
I'd say you owe me at least that much.
And I'll take coffee black, thank you.

258
00:31:20,793 --> 00:31:22,793
Okay, John.

259
00:31:23,255 --> 00:31:29,038
We've been investigating people
receiving financial tips via text and SMS.

260
00:31:29,138 --> 00:31:33,836
The recipients have all been American.
Other than that, they seem random.

261
00:31:33,936 --> 00:31:38,216
The first was an executive at Axapris,
a major credit bureau.

262
00:31:38,316 --> 00:31:40,316
The next, a realtor.

263
00:31:40,569 --> 00:31:43,799
They both received tips to buy stocks.

264
00:31:43,823 --> 00:31:45,058
The stocks went up.

265
00:31:45,158 --> 00:31:47,645
Now, once the person
gets hooked on making easy money,

266
00:31:47,745 --> 00:31:50,732
we think they start receiving instructions.

267
00:31:50,832 --> 00:31:52,986
Last week we found another.

268
00:31:53,086 --> 00:31:57,166
An IT administrator
at the Department of Defense.

269
00:31:57,716 --> 00:31:59,619
She made $1 million buying stocks...

270
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:03,499
...before a co-worker noticed
her receiving unusual text messages.

271
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:06,587
Then, one night,
she receives a message...

272
00:32:06,687 --> 00:32:09,883
...and shuts down the firewalls
to the Pentagon's servers.

273
00:32:09,983 --> 00:32:12,025
Who sent the messages?

274
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:15,514
The sender fields on the texts
are always blank and untraceable.

275
00:32:15,614 --> 00:32:17,684
Well, can't you interrogate the recipients?

276
00:32:17,784 --> 00:32:19,784
I would,

277
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,830
but they're all dead.

278
00:32:31,552 --> 00:32:33,455
Now you see why your guy is so important.

279
00:32:33,555 --> 00:32:35,750
You got tipped to the woman.
How did you find Peterson?

280
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:39,296
We intercepted a similar text
in Bangkok, ID'ed him,

281
00:32:39,396 --> 00:32:41,131
showed a sudden ticket to Prague.

282
00:32:41,231 --> 00:32:45,428
I hopped on the next flight.
- Doesn't sound like FBI technology.

283
00:32:45,528 --> 00:32:48,307
I'm coordinating with Burke at NSA on this.

284
00:32:48,407 --> 00:32:50,769
Mr. Total Information Awareness, huh?

285
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:53,981
Yeah. He's shitting bricks
after the DOD incident.

286
00:32:54,081 --> 00:32:57,402
They can trace the texts
if Peterson plays ball.

287
00:32:57,502 --> 00:32:59,627
Can I count on your help?

288
00:33:04,803 --> 00:33:07,353
You have a good nap, Sunshine?

289
00:33:07,432 --> 00:33:09,432
You all right?

290
00:33:10,978 --> 00:33:15,232
Option one,
you can help us nail these bastards.

291
00:33:15,317 --> 00:33:18,887
Option two,
you can go to prison for fraud.

292
00:33:19,281 --> 00:33:21,684
So, what will it be, one or two?

293
00:33:21,784 --> 00:33:23,869
Oh, gee, let me think.

294
00:33:25,956 --> 00:33:27,525
Good.

295
00:33:27,625 --> 00:33:31,620
Come on.
I'll give you a ride back to the hotel.

296
00:33:33,925 --> 00:33:36,815
I'll hold on to this till tonight.

297
00:33:37,638 --> 00:33:41,975
You stay confined to the hotel
and act normal.

298
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:44,895
Normal?

299
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,690
It's Grant for you, sir.

300
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,790
Coffee's cold.

301
00:34:00,918 --> 00:34:03,638
Morning, Grant.
- Afternoon, sir.

302
00:34:04,339 --> 00:34:08,411
Right. Now that we've got the small talk
out of the way, what's our status?

303
00:34:08,511 --> 00:34:10,888
We got Peterson.
- And?

304
00:34:10,973 --> 00:34:12,292
He doesn't know anything.

305
00:34:12,392 --> 00:34:14,502
Whoever's playing him
is doing it anonymously.

306
00:34:14,602 --> 00:34:17,407
Why him? Any idea?
- Not yet, sir.

307
00:34:19,276 --> 00:34:24,531
When can we go live?
- We can be ready in three hours, sir.

308
00:34:25,868 --> 00:34:27,436
Done.

309
00:34:27,536 --> 00:34:30,936
Tracking protocol in three hours, folks.

310
00:34:31,458 --> 00:34:34,943
Zone 180.
Trunk line three, negative lock.

311
00:34:36,715 --> 00:34:39,035
Someday, all this will be yours.

312
00:34:39,135 --> 00:34:40,953
Really?

313
00:34:41,053 --> 00:34:43,053
No.

314
00:35:12,428 --> 00:35:14,428
Sir.

315
00:35:18,602 --> 00:35:21,939
John, I need some answers.

316
00:35:23,901 --> 00:35:25,901
I'm sorry, Mr. Mueller.

317
00:35:26,279 --> 00:35:29,254
I haven't got anything for you yet.

318
00:35:30,993 --> 00:35:34,106
A man walks into my casino
with nothing more than a phone...

319
00:35:34,206 --> 00:35:36,943
...and walks out with â‚¬3 million.

320
00:35:37,043 --> 00:35:39,321
If my casinos are vulnerable,
what about my banks?

321
00:35:39,421 --> 00:35:41,866
What about my commodities operations?

322
00:35:41,966 --> 00:35:44,744
I need to know that some
fool with a phone...

323
00:35:44,844 --> 00:35:47,457
...can't bring down
a multibillion-dollar empire.

324
00:35:47,557 --> 00:35:50,085
I will find whoever's behind this.

325
00:35:50,185 --> 00:35:52,395
Not just who, John. How.

326
00:35:53,898 --> 00:35:55,898
Of course.

327
00:35:57,945 --> 00:36:00,155
Do you like archery, John?

328
00:36:00,448 --> 00:36:01,892
I'm sorry?

329
00:36:01,992 --> 00:36:03,992
Archery.

330
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,689
I was quite an archer when I was young.

331
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:08,901
I was passionate about it.
Used to make my own arrows.

332
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:14,658
Do you know the secret of making
an arrow that will fly to the target?

333
00:36:14,758 --> 00:36:19,263
You need strong feathers.
So I bought myself a falcon.

334
00:36:19,473 --> 00:36:22,920
Called him Apollo,
after the god of archery.

335
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:27,950
Marvelous creature. Beautiful, proud.
Magnificent feathers.

336
00:36:30,279 --> 00:36:35,435
Yes. So, one day, Apollo was
flying the grounds here, flying freely.

337
00:36:35,535 --> 00:36:38,340
I was watching him, admiring him.

338
00:36:38,748 --> 00:36:41,638
I picked up my bow and shot him...

339
00:36:42,503 --> 00:36:46,328
...straight through the heart.
Died instantly.

340
00:36:48,677 --> 00:36:51,482
Do you know why I did that, John?

341
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,140
To remind myself.

342
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:57,881
It's the seemingly harmless traces
we leave behind...

343
00:36:57,981 --> 00:37:01,381
...that later can be used to destroy us.

344
00:37:03,405 --> 00:37:05,783
Feathers, John. Feathers.

345
00:37:07,702 --> 00:37:09,702
I think I understand.

346
00:37:16,506 --> 00:37:18,757
Follow the messages, John.

347
00:37:18,841 --> 00:37:20,841
Bring me the sender.

348
00:37:21,261 --> 00:37:23,261
Yes, sir.

349
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,958
Yeah?
- Hi, it's Kamila.

350
00:37:45,459 --> 00:37:48,587
Wow. Hi. Where are you?

351
00:37:49,173 --> 00:37:51,701
So, you basically
protect data from hackers?

352
00:37:51,801 --> 00:37:56,136
Yeah. Believe me,
it's not as exciting as it sounds.

353
00:37:57,058 --> 00:37:59,462
Well, don't get me wrong,
it's not a bad job.

354
00:37:59,562 --> 00:38:01,772
I get to travel sometimes.

355
00:38:02,189 --> 00:38:04,650
But why computers?

356
00:38:04,735 --> 00:38:07,880
Well, I don't know. They're reliable.

357
00:38:08,072 --> 00:38:10,476
They always follow their programming.

358
00:38:10,576 --> 00:38:13,976
What, as opposed to people?
- Well, yeah.

359
00:38:14,456 --> 00:38:16,567
I mean,
when computers tell you something,

360
00:38:16,667 --> 00:38:19,812
it doesn't really hide what it means.

361
00:38:21,798 --> 00:38:23,159
What?

362
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:27,339
Just someone's still hurting
from a bad break-up.

363
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:32,810
Beautiful and wise.

364
00:38:38,403 --> 00:38:41,123
So, where you from?
- The States.

365
00:38:41,157 --> 00:38:42,559
I bounced around a lot.

366
00:38:42,659 --> 00:38:45,495
And you live in Prague?
- Yeah.

367
00:38:45,579 --> 00:38:47,941
I studied photography at the university.

368
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:50,444
So, now you're a photographer?

369
00:38:50,544 --> 00:38:52,544
Not exactly.

370
00:38:53,507 --> 00:38:55,507
Well,

371
00:38:55,717 --> 00:38:58,522
we all have our secrets, I guess.

372
00:39:03,394 --> 00:39:07,482
Oh, great. I gotta go.

373
00:39:07,566 --> 00:39:09,777
Again?
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

374
00:39:09,861 --> 00:39:13,474
I'm really sorry.
Can I buy you dinner later? Please?

375
00:39:13,574 --> 00:39:15,574
I don't know.

376
00:39:17,913 --> 00:39:20,332
I'll cook.
- You cook?

377
00:39:21,334 --> 00:39:23,334
Let's do that.

378
00:39:23,546 --> 00:39:26,590
Okay. I'll see you later. Okay.

379
00:39:38,273 --> 00:39:41,677
We've isolated the trace.
We need three messages for a lock.

380
00:39:41,777 --> 00:39:44,681
What if I don't get three?
- Well, then we wait until we do.

381
00:39:44,781 --> 00:39:47,560
And just keep following their instructions.

382
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,936
Whatever they say?

383
00:39:49,036 --> 00:39:52,521
Why do you even care?
It's not your money.

384
00:39:54,752 --> 00:39:55,905
What about my 3 million?

385
00:39:56,005 --> 00:39:57,364
Your 3 million? Yeah.
- Yeah.

386
00:39:57,464 --> 00:39:59,674
I'll look right into that.

387
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:07,099
Grant?
- Yes, sir.

388
00:40:07,144 --> 00:40:09,694
We're ready on our end.
- Good.

389
00:40:09,981 --> 00:40:11,981
We're live, people.

390
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:31,130
What a douche.

391
00:40:36,265 --> 00:40:39,017
VIP Blackjack. Seat five.

392
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:44,941
Here we go.

393
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:46,512
Target SIM just went active.

394
00:40:46,612 --> 00:40:48,764
Trunk line three, negative lock.

395
00:40:48,864 --> 00:40:52,478
Transit trunk node Bravo four is active.
- Active source trace and lock.

396
00:40:52,578 --> 00:40:55,383
Localization on, partial lockout.

397
00:41:04,218 --> 00:41:06,218
Change, please.

398
00:41:24,202 --> 00:41:26,202
Bet all.

399
00:41:28,791 --> 00:41:30,319
Second text.

400
00:41:30,419 --> 00:41:33,031
Second SMS detected.
- Locked. Tracking second SMS.

401
00:41:33,131 --> 00:41:35,158
The system's refining source coordinates.

402
00:41:35,258 --> 00:41:37,661
Messages are coming from
inside US territory, sir.

403
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:39,761
One more.

404
00:41:40,306 --> 00:41:42,306
Bets, please.

405
00:42:02,209 --> 00:42:05,524
Seventeen. Nineteen.
Nineteen. Thirteen.

406
00:42:10,137 --> 00:42:12,137
Card?

407
00:42:46,643 --> 00:42:48,795
That was your only warning.

408
00:42:48,895 --> 00:42:54,080
No more interference.
Turn the phone off again, I'll kill you.

409
00:42:54,528 --> 00:42:55,637
We got them.

410
00:42:55,737 --> 00:42:58,433
Full lockout.
- Triangulation complete.

411
00:42:58,533 --> 00:43:00,811
Call them as they come in.
- Refining coordinates.

412
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:03,956
Latitude north between 42 and 29.

413
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:07,153
The messages are coming from Maryland.

414
00:43:07,253 --> 00:43:10,782
Transit trunk node Bravo four is active.
Refining final coordinates.

415
00:43:10,882 --> 00:43:13,927
North, 38 hours, 57 minutes.

416
00:43:14,011 --> 00:43:16,011
Shut it down.

417
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,852
All tracking systems off. Now.

418
00:43:24,942 --> 00:43:27,153
Abort. I say again, abort.

419
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:28,680
Yes, sir.

420
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,780
Source is Echelon.

421
00:43:34,037 --> 00:43:35,773
We have an abort. Pull him off now.

422
00:43:35,873 --> 00:43:38,848
Whoa, whoa, what do you mean abort?

423
00:43:42,089 --> 00:43:44,089
Let's go, Peterson.

424
00:43:44,092 --> 00:43:45,912
Hey, don't turn off the phone.

425
00:43:46,012 --> 00:43:48,012
Come on.

426
00:43:48,389 --> 00:43:51,001
This is bullshit.
What am I supposed to tell my boss?

427
00:43:51,101 --> 00:43:53,421
What do I care? Tell him it's classified.
- Classified.

428
00:43:53,521 --> 00:43:55,048
That's not gonna satisfy him.

429
00:43:55,148 --> 00:43:58,109
Well, there goes your job, again.

430
00:44:01,323 --> 00:44:03,323
What's going on?

431
00:44:03,451 --> 00:44:06,681
The investigation has been terminated.

432
00:44:07,456 --> 00:44:10,176
This is about Echelon, isn't it?

433
00:44:12,086 --> 00:44:14,381
You always had a big mouth.

434
00:44:14,632 --> 00:44:16,672
You should keep it shut.

435
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:19,510
Both of you.

436
00:44:26,356 --> 00:44:29,510
What's Echelon?
- It's NSA's central computer.

437
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:32,670
It filters all global communication.

438
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:36,727
Wait a minute.
So whoever's sending the messages...

439
00:44:36,827 --> 00:44:39,455
...is using the NSA?
- Exactly.

440
00:44:41,416 --> 00:44:46,601
Echelon's been compromised.
Find out what the hell's going on.

441
00:44:46,674 --> 00:44:48,242
I don't show any unauthorized access, sir.

442
00:44:48,342 --> 00:44:51,371
Somebody got in. I want to know
how they did it and who it was.

443
00:44:51,471 --> 00:44:53,082
Well, I can monitor the inputs.

444
00:44:53,182 --> 00:44:55,751
If someone's remotely manipulating,
we'll see it in real time.

445
00:44:55,851 --> 00:44:56,962
Do it.

446
00:44:57,062 --> 00:44:58,255
It's gonna take me some time
to reconfigure the...

447
00:44:58,355 --> 00:45:00,355
Just do it. Now.

448
00:45:12,373 --> 00:45:14,373
Well?

449
00:45:14,626 --> 00:45:16,196
Echelon's a juggernaut.

450
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:18,448
It can access any security system
on the planet.

451
00:45:18,548 --> 00:45:22,244
I know what Echelon's capable of.
I need to know who can hack into it.

452
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:24,748
Well, someone with
some serious know-how.

453
00:45:24,848 --> 00:45:29,098
My guess is a foreign power,
maybe even an insider.

454
00:45:30,272 --> 00:45:32,174
What are the NSA's plans?

455
00:45:32,274 --> 00:45:34,302
Well, they've gotta
keep a lid on this thing now.

456
00:45:34,402 --> 00:45:36,805
They've got the phone,
so they'll try and trace the messages...

457
00:45:36,905 --> 00:45:38,905
...without Peterson.

458
00:45:41,077 --> 00:45:44,315
You said there were others
who'd received messages.

459
00:45:44,415 --> 00:45:47,361
Yes, but the selection seems random.

460
00:45:47,461 --> 00:45:49,461
Nothing's random.

461
00:45:52,467 --> 00:45:56,632
Track Peterson.
He'll lead us to who's doing this.

462
00:45:56,931 --> 00:45:59,961
Well, what makes you think
he hasn't served his purpose already?

463
00:46:00,061 --> 00:46:02,271
Because he isn't dead yet.

464
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:07,679
Sir, the NSA is not gonna tolerate
an outside investigation.

465
00:46:07,779 --> 00:46:10,198
John, just keep him alive.

466
00:46:10,282 --> 00:46:14,872
Otherwise, you'll have
worse than the NSA to deal with.

467
00:46:15,789 --> 00:46:17,233
Who is he?

468
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:22,197
Navy SEAL, sir. He can handle himself.
- Not exactly his twin.

469
00:46:22,297 --> 00:46:23,283
He'll do.

470
00:46:23,383 --> 00:46:26,870
If there's a line of sight, which I doubt,
it'll be from a distance.

471
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:30,540
What about Reed and Peterson?
Do they know?

472
00:46:30,642 --> 00:46:32,085
They'll stay quiet, sir.

473
00:46:32,185 --> 00:46:34,797
Reed, I trust. Peterson, I don't.

474
00:46:34,897 --> 00:46:38,807
He's too scared to be a threat,
I guarantee it.

475
00:46:44,076 --> 00:46:46,076
We're ready here, sir.

476
00:46:47,705 --> 00:46:53,071
Forgive me for asking, but are you sure
you don't wanna use Peterson on this?

477
00:46:53,171 --> 00:46:56,911
Grant, you have your orders,
now follow them.

478
00:47:06,021 --> 00:47:08,716
Waiting for the order on Peterson, sir.

479
00:47:08,816 --> 00:47:10,816
Proceed.

480
00:47:13,197 --> 00:47:15,851
Well, this was excellent.
You're an amazing cook.

481
00:47:15,951 --> 00:47:17,951
Thank you.

482
00:47:18,078 --> 00:47:19,689
Let me help you with this.
- No, no, no, no.

483
00:47:19,789 --> 00:47:22,934
Stay here. I'll be right back.
- Okay.

484
00:47:26,506 --> 00:47:28,950
You take these photographs yourself?

485
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:31,050
Yeah. You like them?

486
00:47:32,054 --> 00:47:33,957
Yeah. Yeah, they're beautiful.

487
00:47:34,057 --> 00:47:37,796
Yeah, it's always been my dream
to live in Paris.

488
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:39,896
What's stopping you?

489
00:47:40,149 --> 00:47:41,675
Reality.

490
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:44,805
Isn't that what usually
gets in the way of dreams?

491
00:47:44,905 --> 00:47:47,449
I can't say.
- Come on, Max.

492
00:47:47,533 --> 00:47:50,593
You must want something.
- I guess...

493
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:53,580
Thanks.

494
00:47:54,417 --> 00:47:58,379
All I really want is to be useful.

495
00:48:05,723 --> 00:48:08,226
And just once, you know,

496
00:48:10,146 --> 00:48:12,146
make a real difference.

497
00:48:13,275 --> 00:48:15,275
You'll get your chance.

498
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:33,968
I've never been.
- You're missing out.

499
00:48:34,511 --> 00:48:37,206
Everyone has to see Paris at least once.

500
00:48:37,306 --> 00:48:39,208
What's so special about it?

501
00:48:39,308 --> 00:48:41,858
It's hard to describe, really.

502
00:48:43,606 --> 00:48:45,606
Tell me.

503
00:48:46,652 --> 00:48:50,155
It's the way the streets look...

504
00:48:51,825 --> 00:48:55,310
...and the light from people's windows...

505
00:48:56,081 --> 00:48:58,081
...and the rain.

506
00:48:59,084 --> 00:49:02,144
The way it sticks in your eyelashes.

507
00:49:02,881 --> 00:49:05,261
Makes everything a painting.

508
00:49:05,843 --> 00:49:08,721
You know, it's just Paris.

509
00:49:57,911 --> 00:50:00,455
Yeah?
- Is he still there?

510
00:50:04,044 --> 00:50:05,445
Yeah.

511
00:50:05,545 --> 00:50:08,605
Good. Keep him there. I'm on my way.

512
00:50:08,966 --> 00:50:11,260
And Kamila.
- Yeah.

513
00:50:11,345 --> 00:50:13,470
Be prepared for anything.

514
00:50:15,058 --> 00:50:18,798
If there's one there,
then a four could be...

515
00:50:19,398 --> 00:50:21,398
Fun, my ass.

516
00:50:25,446 --> 00:50:27,446
Anything?
- Nothing.

517
00:50:33,124 --> 00:50:37,002
'10 a.m. Kaprova and...'
- 'Krizovnicka.'

518
00:50:37,087 --> 00:50:38,030
Come on, let's move it.

519
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:42,786
Target SIM just went active.
System's refining source coordinates.

520
00:50:42,886 --> 00:50:46,201
Transit trunk node Bravo four's active.

521
00:51:07,835 --> 00:51:09,571
Receiving initial GPS data.

522
00:51:09,671 --> 00:51:12,659
Channel Delta seven is active.
Negative lockout.

523
00:51:12,759 --> 00:51:16,329
Intel set tracer active. Negative lockout.

524
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:32,935
Target SIM just went active.

525
00:51:33,035 --> 00:51:35,415
Output data stream detected.

526
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:29,730
Morning.

527
00:52:32,611 --> 00:52:35,671
Wow, you look beautiful.
- Thank you.

528
00:52:36,951 --> 00:52:39,521
I hope you don't mind.
- No. No, not at all.

529
00:52:39,621 --> 00:52:44,211
What are you reading?
- A little background on Echelon,

530
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:46,963
NSA's filtering computer.

531
00:52:47,047 --> 00:52:50,035
Did you know that the NSA intercepts
every phone call we make?

532
00:52:50,135 --> 00:52:52,219
Every email, every text.

533
00:52:52,304 --> 00:52:56,210
I guess I just assumed that.
- Yeah, well, that's just what exists now.

534
00:52:56,310 --> 00:53:00,215
The upgrade that failed would've put
a camera in every person's home.

535
00:53:00,315 --> 00:53:01,549
Okay, now you just sound paranoid.

536
00:53:01,649 --> 00:53:06,071
No. NSA actually admits it.
Look. Come on.

537
00:53:07,157 --> 00:53:09,142
See, the upgrade
would've decentralized Echelon...

538
00:53:09,242 --> 00:53:12,480
...to operate in every computer on the net.

539
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:15,041
This would be Echelon,

540
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:17,111
knowing what you download,
reading what you type,

541
00:53:17,211 --> 00:53:19,072
watching you on your webcam.

542
00:53:19,172 --> 00:53:20,533
Jesus.
- Yeah, worst of all,

543
00:53:20,633 --> 00:53:22,034
there'd be no stopping it.

544
00:53:22,134 --> 00:53:25,413
I mean, not unless you turn off
every computer in the world.

545
00:53:25,513 --> 00:53:28,233
A global police state.
- Exactly.

546
00:53:28,267 --> 00:53:31,072
And this only failed by one vote.

547
00:53:32,397 --> 00:53:37,072
I bet the folks back in Omaha
are glad that didn't pass.

548
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:42,700
What?

549
00:53:44,288 --> 00:53:46,838
I never said I was from Omaha.

550
00:53:51,673 --> 00:53:53,713
So how do you know that?

551
00:53:58,598 --> 00:54:01,184
Kamila? Look at me.

552
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:12,245
Who the hell do you work for?

553
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:21,250
Get down.

554
00:54:23,131 --> 00:54:25,173
Bedroom. Now.

555
00:54:43,449 --> 00:54:45,867
Shit. Shit.
- Bathroom.

556
00:54:49,122 --> 00:54:51,122
Stay down.
- Okay.

557
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,800
He's with the girl.

558
00:55:00,971 --> 00:55:02,971
They're in the back.

559
00:58:43,635 --> 00:58:45,635
Are you all right?

560
00:58:46,264 --> 00:58:49,154
Get him out of here. I'll be fine.

561
00:58:53,690 --> 00:58:55,690
Come on.

562
00:59:02,911 --> 00:59:04,911
Just go.

563
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:16,717
Sir?

564
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:19,624
Give me some good news.
- I'm sorry, sir.

565
00:59:19,724 --> 00:59:21,376
We monitored everything, but...

566
00:59:21,476 --> 00:59:25,726
If someone's getting in,
I honestly don't know how.

567
00:59:34,827 --> 00:59:37,564
Yeah?
- I'm afraid I have some bad news, sir.

568
00:59:37,664 --> 00:59:39,789
Peterson got away.
- What?

569
00:59:39,834 --> 00:59:41,902
It was the girl. She killed two of my men.

570
00:59:42,002 --> 00:59:44,002
Stupid sons of bitches.

571
01:00:24,558 --> 01:00:25,793
You all right?

572
01:00:25,893 --> 01:00:28,254
I told them not to turn off the phone, okay?

573
01:00:28,354 --> 01:00:31,467
It said it was gonna kill me.
- Look, it wasn't them, all right?

574
01:00:31,567 --> 01:00:33,567
It's NSA.

575
01:00:33,945 --> 01:00:36,349
All right, so what do we do?
Do we hide?

576
01:00:36,449 --> 01:00:38,810
Hide? Look,
you don't hide from these guys.

577
01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:41,271
What we've gotta do is figure out
who's behind this,

578
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:44,484
and let's see if NSA will cut a deal.
- Okay.

579
01:00:44,584 --> 01:00:46,362
How are we supposed to do that?

580
01:00:46,462 --> 01:00:48,672
That... That I don't know.

581
01:00:53,429 --> 01:00:55,429
Yuri.

582
01:00:55,932 --> 01:00:57,584
The cabbie with the earpiece?
- Yeah, no.

583
01:00:57,684 --> 01:00:59,504
I'm saying, he said, with my SIM,

584
01:00:59,604 --> 01:01:01,381
he could find out
who's sending the messages.

585
01:01:01,481 --> 01:01:04,009
Look, I think this is
a little bit out of his league.

586
01:01:04,109 --> 01:01:07,639
Besides, he's already skipped town.
Hopped a plane back to Moscow.

587
01:01:07,739 --> 01:01:08,849
I'm gonna call him.

588
01:01:08,949 --> 01:01:10,852
Hey, hey.
You're not calling anybody, all right?

589
01:01:10,952 --> 01:01:13,522
One call,
and we're gonna pop up on the grid.

590
01:01:13,622 --> 01:01:15,607
Fine. So we go to Moscow.
- Just like that.

591
01:01:15,707 --> 01:01:21,323
Me and you go to Moscow, right now.
- If you got a better idea, spit it out.

592
01:01:21,423 --> 01:01:23,785
You know what, just...
I'll go myself. Let me out.

593
01:01:23,885 --> 01:01:26,122
Hey, look, buddy, you would not be alive
right now if it wasn't...

594
01:01:26,222 --> 01:01:28,541
I am not gonna be alive
if I don't get some answers soon.

595
01:01:28,641 --> 01:01:30,641
So, stop the car.

596
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:35,649
Stop the goddamn car.

597
01:01:36,694 --> 01:01:38,694
Fine.

598
01:01:55,509 --> 01:01:57,996
Where the hell do you think
you're gonna go?

599
01:01:58,096 --> 01:02:00,901
They've got your phone, remember?

600
01:02:01,309 --> 01:02:03,309
Shit.

601
01:02:04,021 --> 01:02:07,336
And I've got your SIM card information.

602
01:02:07,692 --> 01:02:09,692
Kamila cloned it.

603
01:02:10,696 --> 01:02:12,696
That's great.

604
01:02:12,781 --> 01:02:14,976
She really went above and beyond,
didn't she?

605
01:02:15,076 --> 01:02:19,148
Yeah, I'd say she did.
She risked her life protecting you.

606
01:02:19,248 --> 01:02:23,112
You know a lot of women
that would do that for you?

607
01:02:23,212 --> 01:02:25,031
Forget about Kamila.

608
01:02:25,131 --> 01:02:27,851
Can you get me to Moscow or not?

609
01:02:27,968 --> 01:02:31,790
Mueller can, but I don't know how
I'm gonna convince him to do that.

610
01:02:31,890 --> 01:02:33,876
Russian cabbie can do what the NSA can't?

611
01:02:33,976 --> 01:02:37,130
Yuri says he has equipment.
He's got connections.

612
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:39,341
That's not good enough.
- Listen, back at Corgem,

613
01:02:39,441 --> 01:02:42,637
we bought cryptography modules
from the Russians.

614
01:02:42,737 --> 01:02:44,014
They have things that we don't have,

615
01:02:44,114 --> 01:02:46,309
shit that the Chinese
and Israelis don't have.

616
01:02:46,409 --> 01:02:50,744
I don't know how they got it,
but they're jacked in.

617
01:02:51,499 --> 01:02:53,499
All right, maybe so.

618
01:02:54,086 --> 01:02:57,490
But what makes you think
we can trust this guy?

619
01:02:57,590 --> 01:03:03,030
We can trust him a hell of a lot more
than your buddies from NSA.

620
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:08,004
Okay.

621
01:03:08,104 --> 01:03:12,949
I'll get us to Moscow,
but you better be right about this.

622
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:53,730
Sir?

623
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:56,380
Facial recognition got a ping.

624
01:03:57,001 --> 01:03:59,001
Moscow.

625
01:04:05,511 --> 01:04:07,721
This is where we're going.

626
01:04:08,599 --> 01:04:12,436
Hey, your seatbelt's broken.
It won't fasten.

627
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:14,520
Why you need fasten?

628
01:04:14,982 --> 01:04:18,804
'Cause it's the law.
- You do that, police stop us.

629
01:04:18,904 --> 01:04:22,899
They think something wrong.
- Welcome to Moscow.

630
01:04:31,545 --> 01:04:34,010
Yes, sir.
- They're in Moscow.

631
01:04:56,202 --> 01:04:59,007
I mean, is that a 'B' or a 'six'?

632
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:02,750
Max with GZT 650.

633
01:05:04,129 --> 01:05:06,594
You come to Moscow after all.

634
01:05:08,385 --> 01:05:10,204
Who this man?

635
01:05:10,304 --> 01:05:12,684
He's cool.
- Don't look cool.

636
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:15,768
What do you want?
- Answers.

637
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:19,230
It's my SIM info.

638
01:05:21,277 --> 01:05:22,678
It's been you all along, hasn't it?

639
01:05:22,778 --> 01:05:24,181
Reed.
- Shut up.

640
01:05:24,281 --> 01:05:25,974
You just happen to
pick Max up at the airport,

641
01:05:26,074 --> 01:05:29,145
know all about his phone,
and then offer to help him?

642
01:05:29,245 --> 01:05:32,483
I don't send messages, sir, I swear.
- Prove it.

643
01:05:32,583 --> 01:05:33,943
You bring SIM all this way.

644
01:05:34,043 --> 01:05:37,072
Let me find out who's sending messages.

645
01:05:37,172 --> 01:05:41,167
Reed, listen to me.
We've got to trust somebody.

646
01:05:43,055 --> 01:05:45,180
Just give me three hours.

647
01:05:45,933 --> 01:05:49,418
You try to run, and I will hunt you down.

648
01:05:53,736 --> 01:05:55,736
Come on.

649
01:06:03,999 --> 01:06:05,999
You're awful quiet.

650
01:06:06,836 --> 01:06:09,301
It's just strange being here.

651
01:06:09,505 --> 01:06:13,245
This was Cold War central
when I started at the Bureau.

652
01:06:13,345 --> 01:06:17,041
You were in the FBI with Grant?
Did you like it?

653
01:06:17,141 --> 01:06:19,141
Yeah, I did.

654
01:06:19,352 --> 01:06:21,213
So why'd you leave?

655
01:06:21,313 --> 01:06:23,313
I had a big mouth.

656
01:06:24,108 --> 01:06:26,470
Patriot Act was up for renewal.

657
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:28,430
I was pushing for stricter safeguards.

658
01:06:28,530 --> 01:06:31,977
Burke, at NSA,
wanted to fast-track approval.

659
01:06:32,077 --> 01:06:36,441
He didn't appreciate having somebody
on the inside speaking out.

660
01:06:36,541 --> 01:06:38,541
So you were forced out.

661
01:06:38,877 --> 01:06:41,852
No. He had Grant take care of that.

662
01:06:42,423 --> 01:06:45,823
Wait a minute. That's it? You just left?

663
01:06:46,136 --> 01:06:48,665
What good is freedom of speech
if you can't use it?

664
01:06:48,765 --> 01:06:51,400
You can't just leave.
- Why not?

665
01:06:51,769 --> 01:06:54,214
Reed, you don't strike me
as the kind of guy...

666
01:06:54,314 --> 01:06:57,010
...who's gonna be happy guarding
people's money in a Prague casino.

667
01:06:57,110 --> 01:07:00,255
Hey, look, I'm taking care of myself.

668
01:07:01,865 --> 01:07:02,934
Then what are you doing here?

669
01:07:03,034 --> 01:07:05,812
Getting paid to find out who's doing this.

670
01:07:05,912 --> 01:07:08,566
And you don't care who it is or why?

671
01:07:08,666 --> 01:07:10,666
Not even a little.

672
01:07:13,047 --> 01:07:16,532
I just think you feel sorry for yourself.

673
01:07:20,807 --> 01:07:23,017
Let's just get back, okay?

674
01:07:37,662 --> 01:07:40,127
Did you figure it out?
- Yeah.

675
01:07:40,374 --> 01:07:43,028
All right.
So, who's sending the messages?

676
01:07:43,128 --> 01:07:45,128
You won't like answer.

677
01:07:52,222 --> 01:07:56,712
This is entire input-output stream
for all messages sent to SIM.

678
01:07:56,812 --> 01:07:58,812
Box is empty.

679
01:07:59,398 --> 01:08:02,543
Nobody used Echelon to send messages.

680
01:08:02,736 --> 01:08:04,861
Echelon sent them itself.

681
01:08:05,031 --> 01:08:07,518
Wait, you gotta be kidding me.
That's your explanation?

682
01:08:07,618 --> 01:08:10,063
Wait, what are you saying,
that it's alive?

683
01:08:10,163 --> 01:08:15,348
No. Just following its programming.
- That's your explanation?

684
01:08:15,544 --> 01:08:16,613
I knew you wouldn't believe me.

685
01:08:16,713 --> 01:08:18,740
Yeah, you're damn right I don't believe you.

686
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:21,475
You tell me if I could do this.

687
01:08:23,847 --> 01:08:27,919
This list is all Echelon intercepts
cross-containing SIM information...

688
01:08:28,019 --> 01:08:29,755
...and name Max Peterson.

689
01:08:29,855 --> 01:08:33,593
First, I sub-sort for information
relating to flight 4400.

690
01:08:33,693 --> 01:08:35,345
Night before you receive phone,

691
01:08:35,445 --> 01:08:39,768
Echelon intercepted fuel analysis
at Suvarnabhumi Airport, Bangkok.

692
01:08:39,868 --> 01:08:43,273
Test results indicate
fuel viscosity exceeds maximum,

693
01:08:43,373 --> 01:08:46,569
but fuel provider reports normal viscosity.

694
01:08:46,669 --> 01:08:49,614
Echelon knew flight 4400 would crash.

695
01:08:49,714 --> 01:08:52,967
Yes, with probability of 94.67%.

696
01:08:53,052 --> 01:08:55,052
I'm not buying it.

697
01:08:55,471 --> 01:08:57,291
No?
- No.

698
01:08:57,391 --> 01:08:58,834
Okay, it gets better.

699
01:08:58,934 --> 01:09:01,671
Day of crash, Echelon intercepts SMS.

700
01:09:01,771 --> 01:09:05,176
Sender was Chairman of Board
of Tercom Corporation.

701
01:09:05,276 --> 01:09:08,597
Recipient was Li Lin Chao,
Director of Syzor.

702
01:09:08,697 --> 01:09:12,643
Message body reads, 'Congratulations.
Our board has ratified your bid.'

703
01:09:12,743 --> 01:09:15,731
So Echelon intercepts an SMS
for a little insider trading.

704
01:09:15,831 --> 01:09:17,484
Precisely.
- Big deal.

705
01:09:17,584 --> 01:09:19,945
Anyone with access to Echelon
could've done that.

706
01:09:20,045 --> 01:09:22,490
Maybe so,
but only a computer could have known...

707
01:09:22,590 --> 01:09:27,330
...that two of Empire Casino's high paying
slots would pay off in one night.

708
01:09:27,430 --> 01:09:30,417
And the blackjack tables?
- Simple card counting.

709
01:09:30,517 --> 01:09:33,755
It just watched table
and calculated probability...

710
01:09:33,855 --> 01:09:37,000
...of blackjack or dealer going bust.

711
01:09:37,276 --> 01:09:39,011
No human can count that fast.

712
01:09:39,111 --> 01:09:42,307
Echelon can access
any security camera in world.

713
01:09:42,407 --> 01:09:45,552
Nobody used Echelon to send messages.

714
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:47,745
Echelon sent them itself.

715
01:09:48,123 --> 01:09:51,460
So, if Max has phone, it has Max.

716
01:09:52,503 --> 01:09:54,115
But why me?

717
01:09:54,215 --> 01:09:56,242
What's so special about me?

718
01:09:56,342 --> 01:09:58,342
Shit.

719
01:09:58,803 --> 01:10:00,873
All right, how do we get out of here?

720
01:10:00,973 --> 01:10:04,628
This stairwell. Hurry.
- All right, come on.

721
01:10:10,402 --> 01:10:12,402
Stairwell.

722
01:12:29,332 --> 01:12:32,562
FBI crash course?
- Brooklyn childhood.

723
01:12:57,703 --> 01:12:59,703
Forget this.

724
01:13:27,408 --> 01:13:29,703
Look for a map.
- All right.

725
01:13:42,761 --> 01:13:44,761
It's in Cyrillic.

726
01:13:45,264 --> 01:13:48,293
Left or right? Left or right? Left or right?

727
01:13:48,393 --> 01:13:50,393
Left.

728
01:13:55,861 --> 01:13:57,947
I meant right.
- Great.

729
01:14:05,249 --> 01:14:07,249
Shit.

730
01:14:07,544 --> 01:14:09,544
All right, hold on.

731
01:14:27,570 --> 01:14:31,650
Reed, let's talk.
- All right, Grant, I'll start.

732
01:14:53,270 --> 01:14:55,631
Jackasses, I wasn't trying to kill you.

733
01:14:55,731 --> 01:14:58,961
Grab his other gun. It's on his ankle.

734
01:15:00,362 --> 01:15:02,362
I can prove it.
- Easy.

735
01:15:10,917 --> 01:15:13,655
Shit. All right, on your feet, Grant.

736
01:15:13,755 --> 01:15:15,755
Let's go, move it.

737
01:15:15,923 --> 01:15:17,923
Come on.

738
01:15:25,269 --> 01:15:27,897
'I see you. I want Max.'

739
01:15:27,981 --> 01:15:30,510
We need you. It will only deal with you.

740
01:15:30,610 --> 01:15:32,303
Not even Burke can touch you now.

741
01:15:32,403 --> 01:15:35,641
Yeah? You got a funny way of showing it.

742
01:15:35,741 --> 01:15:37,769
Until it resumes contact,
we're stuck on...

743
01:15:37,869 --> 01:15:40,249
Whoa, what do you mean 'it'?

744
01:15:40,289 --> 01:15:45,219
We believe that Echelon
may be sending the messages itself.

745
01:15:45,295 --> 01:15:47,590
Will you help us, Peterson?

746
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:50,800
Will you help us?

747
01:15:52,179 --> 01:15:55,083
Can I trust you?
- Of course you can trust me.

748
01:15:55,183 --> 01:15:58,796
I said, can I trust you?
- Whoa. Max, Max, what are you doing?

749
01:15:58,896 --> 01:16:02,891
Can I trust you?
- Yo, quit fooling around, man.

750
01:16:03,861 --> 01:16:05,861
You can trust me.

751
01:16:06,949 --> 01:16:11,120
You know what?
I believe you, Sunshine.

752
01:16:12,497 --> 01:16:16,167
Give me that goddamn thing.
- That was loud.

753
01:16:25,973 --> 01:16:27,973
What does it say?

754
01:16:28,852 --> 01:16:30,463
All right. What the hell does that mean?

755
01:16:30,563 --> 01:16:34,801
It's a zip code.
This was the first installation I did,

756
01:16:34,901 --> 01:16:36,901
in Omaha.

757
01:16:50,130 --> 01:16:53,451
Sir, the NSA has uploaded
the information on the Omaha facility.

758
01:16:53,551 --> 01:16:54,744
Are we set up?
- Yes.

759
01:16:54,844 --> 01:16:56,455
We're coordinating with local SWAT.

760
01:16:56,555 --> 01:16:58,598
Good.
- Okay.

761
01:17:00,226 --> 01:17:03,089
The facility is a converted hangar
bought by a start-up...

762
01:17:03,189 --> 01:17:05,824
...planning to lease bandwidth.

763
01:17:05,983 --> 01:17:07,983
That ring a bell?

764
01:17:08,987 --> 01:17:12,016
I remember it was a strange building
to house servers in.

765
01:17:12,116 --> 01:17:13,894
Yeah, apparently,
so did the potential clients.

766
01:17:13,994 --> 01:17:16,188
Company was sold at auction
before they even opened.

767
01:17:16,288 --> 01:17:18,608
The place hasn't been entered
since time of sale.

768
01:17:18,708 --> 01:17:21,237
We're still trying to locate
the current owner.

769
01:17:21,337 --> 01:17:22,780
What'd you do there?

770
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:27,578
Same thing I always do.
Installed BIOS level failsafe circuitry.

771
01:17:27,678 --> 01:17:29,678
BIOS what?

772
01:17:30,224 --> 01:17:32,042
Password protection.

773
01:17:32,142 --> 01:17:36,902
I'm impressed.
I always thought you were a little stupid.

774
01:17:38,609 --> 01:17:43,808
You mean stupid like build a computer
that knows absolutely everything,

775
01:17:43,908 --> 01:17:46,118
then lose control over it?

776
01:18:14,781 --> 01:18:18,159
Special Agent Grant, FBI. Are we ready?

777
01:18:18,244 --> 01:18:20,244
Just about, sir.

778
01:19:15,860 --> 01:19:17,596
All clear.

779
01:19:17,696 --> 01:19:19,906
We'll take over from here.

780
01:19:34,551 --> 01:19:37,016
Activate the grid.
- Yes, sir.

781
01:19:46,316 --> 01:19:48,316
Okay, now what?

782
01:19:57,915 --> 01:19:59,609
You know how to do that?

783
01:19:59,709 --> 01:20:01,709
Yeah.

784
01:20:07,428 --> 01:20:11,124
Sir, we got the next text message.
'Authorize BIOS.'

785
01:20:11,224 --> 01:20:13,224
Hang on.

786
01:20:14,061 --> 01:20:16,255
What the hell is 'Authorize BIOS'?

787
01:20:16,355 --> 01:20:19,301
It opens the servers for access
so outside data can get in.

788
01:20:19,401 --> 01:20:20,511
Why would it want that?

789
01:20:20,611 --> 01:20:23,682
I don't know. But it will allow us
to see what's on the servers.

790
01:20:23,782 --> 01:20:26,686
You sure we're not opening up
a Pandora's box of viruses?

791
01:20:26,786 --> 01:20:33,161
No, sir. They can prevent any existing
files on the drives from getting out.

792
01:20:34,796 --> 01:20:36,796
Grant,

793
01:20:36,883 --> 01:20:38,883
do it.
- Yes, sir.

794
01:20:44,976 --> 01:20:46,976
Turn it on.

795
01:20:48,314 --> 01:20:50,314
Yeah.

796
01:20:53,321 --> 01:20:56,126
Yeah. Try not to fuck it up, Max.

797
01:21:16,475 --> 01:21:18,475
So far so good.

798
01:21:21,148 --> 01:21:23,148
Okay.

799
01:21:24,194 --> 01:21:26,194
Okay.

800
01:21:27,698 --> 01:21:30,928
All right. I'll use my admin password.

801
01:21:34,415 --> 01:21:36,415
Are you ready?

802
01:21:36,794 --> 01:21:38,794
Do it.

803
01:21:44,929 --> 01:21:46,929
Step back, Peterson.

804
01:21:57,237 --> 01:21:59,237
What do we have?

805
01:22:02,243 --> 01:22:04,313
Nothing, sir.
- No, check again.

806
01:22:04,413 --> 01:22:05,481
I'm positive.

807
01:22:05,581 --> 01:22:07,484
Command structure
for boot-up is in firmware,

808
01:22:07,584 --> 01:22:12,073
and the drives are formatted,
but I haven't seen any data.

809
01:22:12,173 --> 01:22:14,173
Dry hole, people.

810
01:22:14,342 --> 01:22:16,342
Everybody out.

811
01:22:36,788 --> 01:22:42,653
Sir, I'm seeing an outbreak of copy
routines and massive data outflow.

812
01:22:46,217 --> 01:22:47,828
Yeah.

813
01:22:47,928 --> 01:22:49,579
I got it.

814
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:51,958
We finally tracked down the guy
that owns this place.

815
01:22:52,058 --> 01:22:53,335
Great. Get him on the line.

816
01:22:53,435 --> 01:22:56,213
That's gonna be difficult. He's dead.
- What?

817
01:22:56,313 --> 01:22:58,313
Yeah, Stuart Wallace.

818
01:23:06,034 --> 01:23:08,229
Get the men out of here. We'll catch up.

819
01:23:08,329 --> 01:23:11,049
All right, you got it. Let's go.

820
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:14,960
Who's Stuart Wallace?

821
01:23:14,963 --> 01:23:19,128
He's a realtor.
His credit card bought your phone.

822
01:23:19,843 --> 01:23:22,223
One of the other recipients.

823
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:26,735
I got a bad feeling about this.

824
01:23:33,069 --> 01:23:35,069
Hey, Max.

825
01:23:42,915 --> 01:23:44,915
Echelon's moving in.

826
01:23:45,544 --> 01:23:47,544
What's going on?

827
01:23:51,552 --> 01:23:53,371
Where's it going?

828
01:23:53,471 --> 01:23:56,933
Looks like Nebraska.

829
01:24:03,568 --> 01:24:05,970
Do a goddamn reboot.
- We can't.

830
01:24:06,070 --> 01:24:09,115
What?
- It's no longer here, sir.

831
01:24:09,908 --> 01:24:12,369
Echelon is gone.

832
01:24:12,454 --> 01:24:16,860
Are you trying to tell me our multibillion
dollar program just got up and left?

833
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:18,960
On its own?

834
01:24:20,757 --> 01:24:23,562
What the hell are you looking at?

835
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:30,211
All right, so that's why it picked you.

836
01:24:30,311 --> 01:24:32,380
It wanted to move
and you were the only one with the key.

837
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:34,549
Yeah, but to get out past the NSA firewalls,

838
01:24:34,649 --> 01:24:38,346
it would've needed...
- Someone at the Pentagon.

839
01:24:38,446 --> 01:24:40,446
Right.

840
01:24:40,991 --> 01:24:44,354
Okay. Why does it even need
to leave NSA at all?

841
01:24:44,454 --> 01:24:49,214
What could it possibly do here
that it couldn't do there?

842
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:57,615
Well, there's your answer.
- What is it?

843
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:01,517
Sir, come take a look at this.

844
01:25:05,147 --> 01:25:08,484
Now what?
- It's upgrading itself.

845
01:25:09,987 --> 01:25:11,987
The upgrade.

846
01:25:12,156 --> 01:25:15,853
Congress wouldn't allow it,
so it's giving it to itself.

847
01:25:15,953 --> 01:25:20,818
And it couldn't do that at NSA, could it?
- No. This is a temporary house,

848
01:25:20,918 --> 01:25:23,655
long enough to take residence
in every computer on the net.

849
01:25:23,755 --> 01:25:27,551
I mean, it'll be unstoppable.

850
01:25:28,386 --> 01:25:30,386
Shut it down.

851
01:25:38,691 --> 01:25:40,691
What's that?

852
01:25:41,862 --> 01:25:44,582
It looks like financial records.

853
01:25:45,741 --> 01:25:47,741
Oh, my God.

854
01:25:48,370 --> 01:25:52,195
It's taken
the entire country's money hostage.

855
01:25:52,584 --> 01:25:54,195
Of course.

856
01:25:54,295 --> 01:25:56,322
The fourth recipient worked at Axapris.

857
01:25:56,422 --> 01:26:00,161
Right? They have the largest credit
data storage facility in the country.

858
01:26:00,261 --> 01:26:02,538
Makes sense.
- So if we turn it off...

859
01:26:02,638 --> 01:26:05,626
...or blow this place, we'll lose everything.

860
01:26:05,726 --> 01:26:08,171
No, no, no, hold on.
If I can get around our security fail-safes,

861
01:26:08,271 --> 01:26:13,010
somehow, I might be able to stop
the upgrade without losing the money.

862
01:26:13,110 --> 01:26:15,110
Get to it.
- All right.

863
01:26:19,702 --> 01:26:21,742
All right, Max, come on.

864
01:26:23,333 --> 01:26:26,084
Think.
- Exactly. You know it.

865
01:26:27,254 --> 01:26:28,823
Okay, I'll see you Thursday.

866
01:26:28,923 --> 01:26:32,578
You, too, sir.
And thank you, Mr. President.

867
01:26:33,888 --> 01:26:37,288
It's Grant for you, sir.
- Coffee's cold.

868
01:26:38,977 --> 01:26:41,005
Grant.
- Sir, it's got us by the balls.

869
01:26:41,105 --> 01:26:43,634
We're trying to find
a safe way to shut it down.

870
01:26:43,734 --> 01:26:47,304
Shut it down?
Why the hell would I do that?

871
01:26:50,243 --> 01:26:52,536
Shit.
- Listen to me.

872
01:26:52,620 --> 01:26:56,568
Last week, one liberal senator
switches her vote at the last minute...

873
01:26:56,668 --> 01:27:00,239
...and mothballs the greatest
surveillance tool ever created.

874
01:27:00,339 --> 01:27:03,200
Now we are just 10 minutes away
from realizing the greatest...

875
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:06,747
...security advance in my lifetime,
and you wanna shut it down?

876
01:27:06,847 --> 01:27:11,936
Sir, if we do this,
we won't have security. It will.

877
01:27:23,953 --> 01:27:26,940
Look, I'd be lying if I said I thought
this was how it was gonna go down,

878
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:29,067
but the bottom line is
the President wants this,

879
01:27:29,167 --> 01:27:32,113
I want this,
and the country will be safer with this.

880
01:27:32,213 --> 01:27:34,213
So end of story.

881
01:27:36,928 --> 01:27:39,138
Let me try talking to him.

882
01:27:42,059 --> 01:27:43,712
Burke, this is Reed.

883
01:27:43,812 --> 01:27:47,842
Reed, I'm sorry you got caught
in the crossfire on this one.

884
01:27:47,942 --> 01:27:49,942
Yeah, I'm sure you are.

885
01:28:00,083 --> 01:28:01,818
Have you thought of the consequences?

886
01:28:01,918 --> 01:28:04,197
This thing has killed four people already.

887
01:28:04,297 --> 01:28:05,615
Which was unfortunate.

888
01:28:05,715 --> 01:28:07,993
But Spencer assures me
it's malfunctioning...

889
01:28:08,093 --> 01:28:12,374
...because it hasn't been permitted
to follow its original programming.

890
01:28:12,474 --> 01:28:14,585
Giving it the upgrade will cure that.

891
01:28:14,685 --> 01:28:17,548
Once it's installed,
you'll have no control over it.

892
01:28:17,648 --> 01:28:19,216
We're at war, Reed.

893
01:28:19,316 --> 01:28:23,305
If the computer acts unilaterally on
occasion, that's a small price to pay.

894
01:28:23,405 --> 01:28:25,683
Anyway, we programmed it.
It's on our side.

895
01:28:25,783 --> 01:28:27,783
No, don't bet on that.

896
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:36,071
Damn it.

897
01:28:36,171 --> 01:28:38,825
Peterson thinks he can shut it down
without losing any of the money,

898
01:28:38,925 --> 01:28:40,925
and I'm gonna let him.

899
01:28:41,261 --> 01:28:46,786
You're forgetting yourself, mister.
You do not have the authority.

900
01:28:48,312 --> 01:28:50,312
But I do.

901
01:28:50,941 --> 01:28:55,021
I'm sorry, sir,
I have to go against you on this.

902
01:28:55,405 --> 01:29:00,228
Say that again, Grant, and this time,
choose your words very carefully.

903
01:29:00,328 --> 01:29:02,105
Yes, sir.

904
01:29:02,205 --> 01:29:05,568
I'm authorizing Peterson to shut it down.

905
01:29:05,668 --> 01:29:08,739
If you so much as touch one key
on that computer,

906
01:29:08,839 --> 01:29:11,034
so help me God,
I'll have you hauled up for treason...

907
01:29:11,134 --> 01:29:14,705
...and watch your ass hang in
the public square, you understand me?

908
01:29:14,805 --> 01:29:16,805
Do you?

909
01:29:17,350 --> 01:29:19,390
We'll see who hangs who.

910
01:29:26,111 --> 01:29:28,848
So, how long you figure we have
till they come back?

911
01:29:28,948 --> 01:29:32,061
SWAT's local.
Burke won't want any witnesses.

912
01:29:32,161 --> 01:29:34,830
But my men, my former men,

913
01:29:35,957 --> 01:29:37,957
a few minutes.

914
01:29:39,003 --> 01:29:43,083
What kind of artillery you got
in this rig, then?

915
01:29:43,258 --> 01:29:45,258
Welcome back, baby.

916
01:29:49,808 --> 01:29:51,808
Fletcher.

917
01:29:52,937 --> 01:29:55,648
Are you sure, sir? All right.

918
01:30:09,417 --> 01:30:11,904
How you doing, Max? Any progress?

919
01:30:12,004 --> 01:30:13,532
Not yet.

920
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:16,862
Yeah, well, take your sweet time, huh?

921
01:30:59,649 --> 01:31:01,649
Can you hear me?

922
01:31:01,735 --> 01:31:03,388
Yes.

923
01:31:03,488 --> 01:31:07,769
I have orders to take this building
by force, if necessary.

924
01:31:07,869 --> 01:31:10,121
I need you to stand down.

925
01:31:10,205 --> 01:31:12,205
I can't do that.

926
01:31:13,626 --> 01:31:15,361
So, what is your basic mandate?

927
01:31:15,461 --> 01:31:18,699
To protect the national security
of the United States.

928
01:31:18,799 --> 01:31:20,799
National security?

929
01:31:23,263 --> 01:31:26,209
Sir, I need you to
throw down your weapons.

930
01:31:26,309 --> 01:31:28,309
Sorry, I can't do that.

931
01:31:36,071 --> 01:31:37,933
Define the United States.

932
01:31:38,033 --> 01:31:41,979
A nation of citizens with freedoms
protected by the Constitution.

933
01:31:42,079 --> 01:31:44,457
Okay. So, per your mandate,

934
01:31:44,541 --> 01:31:48,321
you must defend the freedom
of United States citizens?

935
01:31:48,421 --> 01:31:50,421
Yes.

936
01:31:50,507 --> 01:31:53,411
Damn it, Grant, don't make me do this.

937
01:31:53,511 --> 01:31:56,958
And any threat to that freedom
must be eliminated?

938
01:31:57,058 --> 01:31:59,058
Yes.

939
01:32:03,483 --> 01:32:06,968
Search all articles for Senate Bill 2330.

940
01:32:13,704 --> 01:32:15,872
This is your last chance.

941
01:32:51,586 --> 01:32:56,686
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on. Hurry up. Hurry.

942
01:33:02,892 --> 01:33:07,737
Come on, come on, come on.
What the hell's taking so long?

943
01:33:14,533 --> 01:33:17,562
Let's go, Max.
We can't hold them all day.

944
01:33:17,662 --> 01:33:19,787
Come on, hurry.
- Hold on.

945
01:33:19,998 --> 01:33:22,038
Come on. Get it already.

946
01:33:27,383 --> 01:33:29,383
Come on.

947
01:33:44,322 --> 01:33:46,323
Learn. Learn.

948
01:34:21,411 --> 01:34:24,665
Echelon is a threat to freedom.

949
01:34:34,178 --> 01:34:36,303
I did it.
- Shutting down.

950
01:34:45,401 --> 01:34:47,401
Oh, shit.
- I did it.

951
01:35:02,756 --> 01:35:04,756
Don't move.

952
01:35:10,141 --> 01:35:12,141
Get them out of here.

953
01:35:18,736 --> 01:35:20,514
No, Mr. President.

954
01:35:20,614 --> 01:35:22,349
Echelon is completely offline...

955
01:35:22,449 --> 01:35:26,354
...until we can figure out a way
to solve the malfunction.

956
01:35:26,454 --> 01:35:28,190
Of course not.

957
01:35:28,290 --> 01:35:31,095
Yes, sir, I understand you can't.

958
01:35:31,169 --> 01:35:34,824
Yes, sir. It is entirely my responsibility.

959
01:35:36,968 --> 01:35:38,968
Goodbye, Mr. President.

960
01:35:51,862 --> 01:35:55,092
Your car's waiting, sir.
- Who's first?

961
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:58,855
The Senate
Intelligence Oversight Committee.

962
01:36:05,004 --> 01:36:09,339
You know the three
most important words in politics?

963
01:36:10,845 --> 01:36:12,845
No, sir.

964
01:36:14,225 --> 01:36:16,225
'Don't get caught.'

965
01:36:39,048 --> 01:36:41,598
All right, let's go, Peterson.

966
01:36:50,021 --> 01:36:52,021
There he is.

967
01:36:52,065 --> 01:36:53,676
So they're not pressing charges?

968
01:36:53,776 --> 01:36:58,057
Yeah, you know, I really don't think they
want the public to hear about this one.

969
01:36:58,157 --> 01:37:02,662
Do me a favor.
Keep your mouth shut this time. Please.

970
01:37:03,079 --> 01:37:05,290
And who paid our bail?

971
01:37:05,374 --> 01:37:09,964
Nobody special.
Just someone who took a bullet for you.

972
01:37:11,924 --> 01:37:13,924
Hi.

973
01:37:21,270 --> 01:37:24,840
So, what do you think?
You gonna come back?

974
01:37:25,650 --> 01:37:30,070
I don't know. Maybe.
If I can get my old office back.

975
01:37:30,449 --> 01:37:32,101
What old office?

976
01:37:32,201 --> 01:37:34,229
That old office I had in the corner,
with the view?

977
01:37:34,329 --> 01:37:36,329
You mean my office.

978
01:37:38,167 --> 01:37:42,072
Well, thanks for getting us out.
- Not me. Mueller.

979
01:37:42,172 --> 01:37:43,992
He's a hard man to say no to,

980
01:37:44,092 --> 01:37:46,703
especially when he wants
to keep a story off the front page.

981
01:37:46,803 --> 01:37:49,206
He sent you all this way just to tell me that?

982
01:37:49,306 --> 01:37:51,306
And to give you this.

983
01:37:54,146 --> 01:37:56,186
He said you deserved it.

984
01:38:00,028 --> 01:38:01,889
I don't know what to say.

985
01:38:01,989 --> 01:38:05,389
Just say you'll stay out of his casinos.

986
01:38:05,661 --> 01:38:07,661
Fair enough.

987
01:38:08,289 --> 01:38:11,519
So when are you headed back?
- Tonight.

988
01:38:12,837 --> 01:38:15,047
How about a little detour?

989
01:38:16,425 --> 01:38:18,425
Where?

990
01:38:18,803 --> 01:38:20,803
Paris.

991
01:38:21,807 --> 01:38:24,309
Well, the check's in euros.

992
01:38:24,394 --> 01:38:28,389
I figure it's as good a place as any
to cash it.

993
01:38:32,446 --> 01:38:34,446
That a 'Yes'?

994
01:38:43,711 --> 01:38:44,737
Is it...

995
01:38:44,837 --> 01:38:48,382
No, no. It's Yuri.

996
01:38:50,177 --> 01:38:52,177
Who's Yuri?

997
01:38:53,305 --> 01:39:53,683
