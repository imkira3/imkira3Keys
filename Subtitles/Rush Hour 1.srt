2
00:04:00,796 --> 00:04:02,764
Forgive me, Consul Han...

3
00:04:02,798 --> 00:04:05,892
but I believe
we can ill afford...

4
00:04:05,934 --> 00:04:08,926
to lose men
of your high character.

5
00:04:08,971 --> 00:04:11,337
And speaking as a friend...

6
00:04:11,373 --> 00:04:14,865
who's fought side by side
with you for 15 years...

7
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,310
I will sorely miss
the unshakable support...

8
00:04:17,346 --> 00:04:19,246
you've given
the Royal Hong Kong Police.

9
00:04:19,281 --> 00:04:22,580
So, on behalf of all Brits...

10
00:04:22,618 --> 00:04:24,882
who have ever carried the shield
in Hong Kong...

11
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,217
we shall miss you.

12
00:04:26,255 --> 00:04:28,018
We wish you nothing
but happiness...

13
00:04:28,057 --> 00:04:30,582
as you take up your new post
in the United States.

14
00:04:30,626 --> 00:04:33,595
Ladies and gentlemen,
Consul Han.

15
00:04:34,963 --> 00:04:36,430
Thank you, Thomas.

16
00:04:40,135 --> 00:04:44,265
You know Thomas is not going
to make this evening easy.

17
00:04:44,306 --> 00:04:45,466
Excuse me.

18
00:04:52,281 --> 00:04:53,475
Commander Griffin...

19
00:04:53,515 --> 00:04:56,177
I am pleased to be able
to leave you and Hong Kong...

20
00:04:56,218 --> 00:04:58,448
with a special gift tonight.

21
00:04:58,487 --> 00:05:01,047
Earlier this evening,
Detective Inspector Lee...

22
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,854
and his special task force
have once and for all...

23
00:05:03,892 --> 00:05:05,655
crushed the Juntao
criminal organization...

24
00:05:05,694 --> 00:05:07,594
and reclaimed artifacts...

25
00:05:07,629 --> 00:05:10,223
from 5,000 years
of China's heritage.

26
00:05:12,868 --> 00:05:14,335
Thank you.

27
00:05:15,971 --> 00:05:18,405
This is the kind of legacy
I dreamt about.

28
00:05:19,108 --> 00:05:20,598
Hong Kong forever.

29
00:05:20,642 --> 00:05:23,167
To Hong Kong forever.

30
00:05:30,452 --> 00:05:31,612
Soo Yung.

31
00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:12,126
Stupid fool!

32
00:06:12,161 --> 00:06:15,688
Get the hell out of my way!
Man, are you crazy?

33
00:06:15,731 --> 00:06:16,857
Shoot!

34
00:06:16,899 --> 00:06:18,127
You moron!

35
00:06:24,273 --> 00:06:26,798
Clive, what's up, man?

36
00:06:26,842 --> 00:06:28,969
You're late.

37
00:06:29,011 --> 00:06:30,876
- I'm late?
- Yeah, you're late.

38
00:06:30,913 --> 00:06:34,280
I've been waiting
in the back for over an hour.

39
00:06:34,316 --> 00:06:36,876
- I was in the diner.
- I told you in the back.

40
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:39,080
Think I would do this shit
out front?

41
00:06:39,121 --> 00:06:41,749
- I'm gonna get busted.
- You weren't in the diner.

42
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,156
I said in the back- - 
It don't even matter.

43
00:06:44,193 --> 00:06:47,629
Let's do this.
What's that, a gun?

44
00:06:47,663 --> 00:06:49,563
How many people
you killed this year?

45
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:52,158
Stop it, man.
Let's do it. Come on.

46
00:06:52,201 --> 00:06:53,395
Don't be late again.

47
00:06:53,435 --> 00:06:55,460
I ain't gonna be late.
What we got?

48
00:06:57,272 --> 00:06:58,933
That's tight.

49
00:06:58,974 --> 00:07:01,670
That's beautiful. That's nice.
What's that?

50
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,804
- That's C- 4.
- That's C- 4?

51
00:07:04,847 --> 00:07:07,145
- Oh, shit.
- What's the problem?

52
00:07:07,182 --> 00:07:09,810
No problem. I been looking
everywhere for this shit.

53
00:07:09,852 --> 00:07:13,447
How the hell you find some C- 4?

54
00:07:13,489 --> 00:07:15,719
The Iraqis
can't even get this shit.

55
00:07:15,757 --> 00:07:17,418
Where'd you get this from?

56
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:18,721
it's a hot ticket.

57
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,853
You don't know how happy
you made me.

58
00:07:20,896 --> 00:07:23,387
You got what I want.
Let me get that money.

59
00:07:23,432 --> 00:07:24,694
Step away from the car.

60
00:07:24,733 --> 00:07:26,894
Hey, officers.

61
00:07:26,935 --> 00:07:29,802
Put your hands above your heads.
Just do it now.

62
00:07:29,838 --> 00:07:32,864
Ain't no problem here.
Why y'all messing with us for?

63
00:07:32,908 --> 00:07:34,808
All right, take it easy.

64
00:07:34,843 --> 00:07:36,868
- You don't wanna do that.
- Yes, I do.

65
00:07:36,912 --> 00:07:39,642
- No, he don't. He's playing.
- No, I ain't playing.

66
00:07:39,681 --> 00:07:42,081
- Yes, he is, officer.
- I'm not playing!

67
00:07:42,117 --> 00:07:43,243
Drop the gun!

68
00:07:43,285 --> 00:07:45,082
He's just my cousin.
We're just talking.

69
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,587
Get in your car and leave.

70
00:07:46,622 --> 00:07:47,987
We can't do that.

71
00:07:48,023 --> 00:07:50,423
I'll blow his head
all over the parking lot!

72
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:51,824
Go away and buy some doughnuts!

73
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,259
See? You made him mad.

74
00:07:53,295 --> 00:07:55,456
Let me talk to him.
All right?

75
00:07:56,465 --> 00:07:57,727
Don't move!

76
00:07:57,766 --> 00:08:00,394
All right.
Everything's cool now.

77
00:08:00,435 --> 00:08:03,666
He down. The gun's down.
Get back in the car and leave.

78
00:08:03,705 --> 00:08:04,831
Hands on your head!

79
00:08:04,873 --> 00:08:06,602
Everything's cool, officer.

80
00:08:06,642 --> 00:08:07,836
Do it now!

81
00:08:27,496 --> 00:08:28,793
Didn't I tell you?

82
00:08:49,751 --> 00:08:52,311
Stop it! I got C- 4 in the trunk!

83
00:09:19,214 --> 00:09:21,876
Clive, guess what, man.

84
00:09:21,917 --> 00:09:24,818
I forgot to tell you.
I'm LAPD.

85
00:09:24,853 --> 00:09:26,218
You under arrest.

86
00:09:31,093 --> 00:09:34,062
Soo Yung, come on,
we're gonna be late.

87
00:09:34,096 --> 00:09:35,893
Let's go.

88
00:09:35,931 --> 00:09:37,796
Excuse me.

89
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,926
What?

90
00:09:39,968 --> 00:09:41,936
Telephone. China.

91
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,503
Soo Yung, I love you.
Have a nice day.

92
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,306
Will you be home after school?

93
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,281
I am going to pick you up
myself.

94
00:10:25,047 --> 00:10:27,538
When you walk by every night...

95
00:10:27,582 --> 00:10:29,709
talkin' sweet
and lookin' fine...

96
00:10:29,751 --> 00:10:33,710
I become hectic inside.

97
00:10:33,755 --> 00:10:36,724
Baby, I'm so into you.

98
00:10:36,758 --> 00:10:39,249
Darlin', if you only knew...

99
00:10:39,294 --> 00:10:42,457
all the things
that float through my mind.

100
00:11:04,219 --> 00:11:05,481
Is there a problem, officer?

101
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,818
No problem.

102
00:11:07,856 --> 00:11:09,323
Just rush hour.

103
00:12:04,412 --> 00:12:06,539
Security's in place?

104
00:12:06,581 --> 00:12:09,607
You're sure all of the exhibits
will be ready by this weekend?

105
00:12:09,651 --> 00:12:12,916
Yes, sir. Your opening remarks
are scheduled for 7:30.

106
00:12:12,954 --> 00:12:15,582
Excuse me, Consul Han.

107
00:12:15,624 --> 00:12:19,219
I'm Warren Russ with the
Federal Bureau of lnvestigation.

108
00:12:19,261 --> 00:12:21,252
This is Agent Whitney.

109
00:12:21,296 --> 00:12:23,025
We need to speak with you
in private.

110
00:12:25,634 --> 00:12:26,794
Excuse me.

111
00:12:34,476 --> 00:12:37,001
I know this is a difficult time
for you, Consul...

112
00:12:37,045 --> 00:12:39,445
but be assured
we'll get your daughter back.

113
00:12:39,481 --> 00:12:41,142
But will you get her back alive?

114
00:12:41,183 --> 00:12:44,641
We have the best agents
in the world on those streets.

115
00:12:45,787 --> 00:12:48,779
I would like
one of my people to help.

116
00:12:48,824 --> 00:12:52,783
Let me assure you, the FBI
considers this a top priority.

117
00:12:52,828 --> 00:12:55,126
We have plenty of people
on the case.

118
00:12:55,163 --> 00:12:57,996
Mr. Russ, I am not an American.

119
00:12:58,033 --> 00:13:00,092
My daughter is not an American.

120
00:13:00,135 --> 00:13:01,397
I understand that, sir- - 

121
00:13:01,436 --> 00:13:03,802
He's already on the plane.

122
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,273
I trust you will treat him
with the same courtesy...

123
00:13:06,308 --> 00:13:08,276
as you have shown me.

124
00:13:12,447 --> 00:13:13,914
Ten people
jumped out of the trunk.

125
00:13:13,949 --> 00:13:16,816
I started handling all of them.
Throwing them everywhere.

126
00:13:16,852 --> 00:13:18,820
Then two stupid cops
came out of nowhere...

127
00:13:18,854 --> 00:13:20,822
messed everything up,
but then I regrouped.

128
00:13:20,856 --> 00:13:22,323
I had to save their life.

129
00:13:22,357 --> 00:13:24,484
It ain't in there.
Anyway, I save their life.

130
00:13:24,526 --> 00:13:26,517
I start runnin',
trying to get the bomb- - 

131
00:13:26,561 --> 00:13:29,257
I can't believe
you went without me.

132
00:13:29,297 --> 00:13:30,992
I'll talk to y'all later,
all right?

133
00:13:31,032 --> 00:13:33,125
I'll tell you the best part
after work.

134
00:13:33,168 --> 00:13:35,102
This is why nobody
wilI work with you...

135
00:13:35,136 --> 00:13:38,401
why you're the only cop in the
department without a partner.

136
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,534
Johnson, look, first of all,
if you want a date with me...

137
00:13:41,576 --> 00:13:44,170
you have to wait on the list
like every other woman, OK?

138
00:13:44,212 --> 00:13:46,271
Second of all, I work alone.

139
00:13:46,314 --> 00:13:49,374
I don't need no partner
and ain't never gonna have one.

140
00:13:49,417 --> 00:13:51,783
- Did Kojak have a partner?
- Yeah. The fat guy.

141
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,981
He wasn't never with him.
Did Columbo?

142
00:13:54,022 --> 00:13:55,990
Captain Diel ordered me
to go with you...

143
00:13:56,024 --> 00:13:58,788
because you needed bomb squad
backup, but once again...

144
00:13:58,827 --> 00:14:00,351
you screwed me and yourself.

145
00:14:00,395 --> 00:14:02,056
Look, Johnson,
it's dangerous out there.

146
00:14:02,097 --> 00:14:04,429
it's safer for you
to be behind the desk.

147
00:14:04,466 --> 00:14:07,026
We were supposed to be
on the same team.

148
00:14:07,068 --> 00:14:09,400
Team?
Johnson, this is the LAPD...

149
00:14:09,437 --> 00:14:11,564
the most hated cops
in the free world.

150
00:14:11,606 --> 00:14:13,267
My own mama ashamed of me.

151
00:14:13,308 --> 00:14:15,139
She tell everybody
I'm a drug dealer.

152
00:14:15,176 --> 00:14:16,939
This is a pit stop for me.

153
00:14:16,978 --> 00:14:18,775
I'm on the verge of leaving
you suckers behind.

154
00:14:18,813 --> 00:14:21,509
Actually, you're on the verge
of being suspended.

155
00:14:21,549 --> 00:14:22,743
Have a nice day.

156
00:14:29,124 --> 00:14:30,853
Somebody told you
I was being suspended?

157
00:14:32,494 --> 00:14:34,291
Quit playin', girl.

158
00:14:35,931 --> 00:14:37,762
I know you playin'.

159
00:14:39,034 --> 00:14:41,002
Somebody told you
I was being suspended?

160
00:14:43,672 --> 00:14:45,902
This is a problem.
That's all I need...

161
00:14:45,941 --> 00:14:47,670
some foreigner
getting his head blown off...

162
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:49,370
and creating
an international incident.

163
00:14:49,411 --> 00:14:51,641
What can we do?
He's on his way.

164
00:14:53,581 --> 00:14:55,811
Call the field office.
Have them send over a rookie.

165
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:58,341
We'll have him escort this guy
around a few days...

166
00:14:58,386 --> 00:15:00,820
pretend to follow some leads,
show him some sights...

167
00:15:00,855 --> 00:15:02,254
keep him out of our way.

168
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,554
You want to do that
to one of men?

169
00:15:04,592 --> 00:15:06,355
What do you suggest?

170
00:15:08,096 --> 00:15:11,554
Well, as long as we're
gonna humiliate someone...

171
00:15:11,599 --> 00:15:13,590
might as well be LAPD.

172
00:15:16,037 --> 00:15:17,470
Even if I had an extra man...

173
00:15:17,505 --> 00:15:20,133
who would want
such a bullshit assignment?

174
00:15:20,175 --> 00:15:21,938
Well, it's a disgrace to me.

175
00:15:21,977 --> 00:15:23,911
it's a disgrace
to my department.

176
00:15:23,945 --> 00:15:25,207
it's a disgrace to- - 

177
00:15:27,082 --> 00:15:30,449
Dan, I'm sending someone
right over.

178
00:15:33,455 --> 00:15:36,720
Captain, I know you read
the paper, but they lying.

179
00:15:36,758 --> 00:15:38,191
I wouldn't do nothing like that.

180
00:15:38,226 --> 00:15:41,024
You know how the paper is.
They just want a story.

181
00:15:41,062 --> 00:15:43,895
Two officers were shot.
One man lost a pinkie.

182
00:15:43,932 --> 00:15:45,229
But didn't nobody die.

183
00:15:45,266 --> 00:15:48,064
- You destroyed half a block.
- That block was messed up.

184
00:15:48,103 --> 00:15:50,571
- You lost lots of evidence.
- We got a little left.

185
00:15:50,605 --> 00:15:53,665
What you did was dangerous
and completely against policy.

186
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:56,506
And not only that...

187
00:15:56,544 --> 00:15:58,239
you did a good job.

188
00:15:59,347 --> 00:16:00,541
What?

189
00:16:00,582 --> 00:16:02,777
Everyone around here
is so image- conscious.

190
00:16:02,817 --> 00:16:05,308
Everybody's so afraid
of their own goddamn shadow.

191
00:16:05,353 --> 00:16:07,548
it's nice to meet
an L.A. detective...

192
00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:10,114
who's willing to lay it
on the line.

193
00:16:10,158 --> 00:16:13,559
Captain,
that's the same way I feel.

194
00:16:13,595 --> 00:16:15,495
That's what I've been trying
to tell everybody.

195
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:18,431
Every so often, we have to let
the general public know...

196
00:16:18,466 --> 00:16:20,263
that we can still blow shit up.

197
00:16:20,301 --> 00:16:23,327
You goddamn right.
That's the only way I work.

198
00:16:23,371 --> 00:16:24,963
So that mean
I ain't gettin' suspended?

199
00:16:25,006 --> 00:16:27,497
- Are you kidding?
- Don't know why I said that.

200
00:16:27,542 --> 00:16:29,476
I just got a call from the FBI.

201
00:16:29,511 --> 00:16:31,604
The 10- year- old daughter
of a Chinese diplomat...

202
00:16:31,646 --> 00:16:34,774
was kidnapped this morning,
and they want you on the case.

203
00:16:34,816 --> 00:16:36,113
FBI want me?

204
00:16:36,151 --> 00:16:37,584
That's right.

205
00:16:37,619 --> 00:16:39,746
- Stop lying.
- I don't lie.

206
00:16:39,788 --> 00:16:41,483
- Tell the truth.
- I'm telling the truth.

207
00:16:42,657 --> 00:16:44,591
Thank you, Captain.

208
00:16:44,626 --> 00:16:47,789
Congratulations, Carter.
You are going to the show.

209
00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:50,389
I'll look out for you
when I reach the top.

210
00:16:50,432 --> 00:16:53,094
- I'm gonna make you mayor.
- I'd rather you didn't.

211
00:16:55,403 --> 00:16:58,839
Hey, listen up!
If anybody need me...

212
00:16:58,873 --> 00:17:02,775
I'm gonna be workin'
a big, big case for the FBI!

213
00:17:19,494 --> 00:17:21,428
Yo. Take care of that for me.

214
00:17:35,276 --> 00:17:39,303
I need one of those earpieces
immediately, all right?

215
00:17:39,347 --> 00:17:40,746
Hey, how you doing?

216
00:17:40,782 --> 00:17:43,615
I want the consul's personnel
records cross- checked...

217
00:17:43,651 --> 00:17:46,119
with that new list
we received from lnterpol.

218
00:17:46,154 --> 00:17:48,952
See if you can make
any matches or connections.

219
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,924
OK, boys, what have we got?

220
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:52,927
Have we checked the consul
personnel records yet?

221
00:17:52,961 --> 00:17:55,395
I want to know
who's he been talking with.

222
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,057
OK, come on. Give me the story.

223
00:17:57,098 --> 00:17:59,692
Any demands? Any fingerprints?
Have we interviewed his staff?

224
00:17:59,734 --> 00:18:02,362
Whitney, who is this?

225
00:18:03,505 --> 00:18:05,200
Give me a copy of that.

226
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,208
James Carter, FBI.

227
00:18:07,242 --> 00:18:10,075
Warren, he's here
for the special assignment.

228
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,905
I'm Agent- ln- Charge Warren Russ.

229
00:18:14,949 --> 00:18:17,440
it's good to have you onboard.

230
00:18:17,485 --> 00:18:18,884
I waited a long time for this.

231
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,753
You guys sure take a long time
to process an application.

232
00:18:21,789 --> 00:18:25,384
Well, Carter,
your particular assignment...

233
00:18:25,426 --> 00:18:27,894
is considered G- 14 classified.

234
00:18:27,929 --> 00:18:33,367
Why don't you and I take a walk
and I'll fill you in?

235
00:18:33,401 --> 00:18:34,663
OK, Warren.

236
00:18:40,141 --> 00:18:42,234
G- 14 classified.

237
00:18:42,277 --> 00:18:43,904
That's good.

238
00:18:43,945 --> 00:18:46,072
You don't understand.
This is my dream.

239
00:18:46,114 --> 00:18:48,082
I'm very excited
about working with the FBI.

240
00:18:48,116 --> 00:18:51,085
I'm glad.
Listen, his name is Lee.

241
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:53,747
And the director considers
this a top priority.

242
00:18:53,788 --> 00:18:56,586
No disrespect, but he's only
gonna get in my way.

243
00:18:56,624 --> 00:18:58,091
I'm not used
to having a partner.

244
00:18:58,126 --> 00:19:01,061
If I'm handling the situation,
I'm gonna have to work alone.

245
00:19:01,095 --> 00:19:03,359
Carter, he is the situation.

246
00:19:04,399 --> 00:19:06,026
Must be a misunderstanding.

247
00:19:06,067 --> 00:19:09,230
I was sent down here for
the kidnapping. Little girl?

248
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,738
Forget the little girl.
Your assignment is Lee.

249
00:19:13,241 --> 00:19:15,038
Who and what kind of assignment
is that?

250
00:19:15,076 --> 00:19:18,534
Lee is a foreign detective
and a friend of the consul's.

251
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:22,209
it's your job to keep him out
of sight and away from danger.

252
00:19:23,418 --> 00:19:26,546
Yeah, you want me to baby- sit,
but I don't do that.

253
00:19:26,588 --> 00:19:28,556
I came down here
for the big assignment.

254
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,558
The truth is,
this is an FBI operation...

255
00:19:30,592 --> 00:19:34,551
and I don't need help from LAPD
or some Chun- King cop.

256
00:19:34,596 --> 00:19:36,063
You got it?

257
00:19:37,065 --> 00:19:38,464
Whoa. Hold it.

258
00:19:38,499 --> 00:19:40,990
Why not use your men
for this top- priority case?

259
00:19:41,035 --> 00:19:43,401
What am I supposed to do,
take him to the zoo?

260
00:19:43,438 --> 00:19:44,598
I don't give a damn.

261
00:19:44,639 --> 00:19:47,437
I don't want to see him
or you till this is resolved.

262
00:19:47,475 --> 00:19:49,909
Now, his plane arrives
in an hour.

263
00:19:49,944 --> 00:19:52,572
We want to make
a good impression, Carter.

264
00:19:52,614 --> 00:19:54,878
it's his first trip to America.

265
00:19:56,084 --> 00:19:58,052
This is bullshit!

266
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,888
Please tell me
you speak English.

267
00:20:41,496 --> 00:20:43,794
I'm Detective Carter!

268
00:20:43,831 --> 00:20:46,231
Do you speaka any English?

269
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:53,563
Do you understand the words
that are coming out of my mouth?

270
00:20:59,047 --> 00:21:01,538
I cannot believe this shit!

271
00:21:01,582 --> 00:21:03,573
First,
I get a bullshit assignment...

272
00:21:03,618 --> 00:21:05,449
now, Mr. Rice- A- Roni...

273
00:21:07,121 --> 00:21:08,611
don't even speak American.

274
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,782
Come on. My ride's over here.

275
00:21:14,529 --> 00:21:16,053
Put your bag in the back.

276
00:21:20,635 --> 00:21:24,298
Put your bag in the back!

277
00:21:26,641 --> 00:21:30,099
No. You put your own shit
in the back!

278
00:21:30,144 --> 00:21:32,112
I am not a skycap.

279
00:21:32,146 --> 00:21:34,307
I'm FBI, you understand?

280
00:21:36,818 --> 00:21:38,809
What the hell you think this is?

281
00:21:42,924 --> 00:21:45,119
Captain, I don't think
this is funny.

282
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:47,127
No, I'm serious, Captain.
I ain't playin'.

283
00:21:47,161 --> 00:21:49,095
Tell the FBI you made a mistake.

284
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,654
I can't do that, Carter.

285
00:21:50,698 --> 00:21:54,691
I'm sure that you and Mr. Lee
will have a nice time together.

286
00:21:54,736 --> 00:21:58,502
You better call the FBI or
I drop his ass at Panda Express.

287
00:21:58,539 --> 00:22:01,702
Drop this case, you're suspended
for two months without pay.

288
00:22:01,743 --> 00:22:04,837
Well, you can forget
about being mayor then.

289
00:22:04,879 --> 00:22:06,574
Congratulations, Carter.

290
00:22:06,614 --> 00:22:09,105
Looks like you finally
got yourself a partner.

291
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,351
One little pinkie get blowed off
and everybody trippin'.

292
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:19,051
Chinese consul?

293
00:22:20,128 --> 00:22:22,426
That's one of the places
you can't go.

294
00:22:22,463 --> 00:22:24,260
I ain't getting fired.
You gonna pay my bills?

295
00:22:26,134 --> 00:22:27,499
That's the little girl?

296
00:22:29,637 --> 00:22:31,229
Say something.

297
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,267
Y'alI think this is real funny.

298
00:22:34,308 --> 00:22:37,607
Give Carter
the big G- 14 classified case.

299
00:22:37,645 --> 00:22:40,614
Gonna show the FBI they don't
know who they playing with.

300
00:22:40,648 --> 00:22:42,548
I'll solve this case myself.

301
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:43,880
That's right.

302
00:22:53,995 --> 00:22:57,123
But I wanna show you something
first. Look familiar?

303
00:22:57,165 --> 00:23:00,134
Just like home, ain't it?

304
00:23:00,168 --> 00:23:03,569
I ain't never been to China,
but it probably look like this.

305
00:23:03,604 --> 00:23:05,003
Get your star maps!

306
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,599
Look, John Wayne.

307
00:23:08,609 --> 00:23:10,236
You know John Wayne?

308
00:23:10,278 --> 00:23:11,472
John Wayne.

309
00:23:11,512 --> 00:23:13,742
Yeah, John Wayne, man.
Hang out with the Duke.

310
00:23:13,781 --> 00:23:15,248
I'll be right back.

311
00:23:15,283 --> 00:23:17,080
You might see
one of your cousins here.

312
00:23:17,118 --> 00:23:19,848
Find them and stalk 'em !

313
00:23:19,887 --> 00:23:21,081
Star maps!

314
00:23:21,122 --> 00:23:23,090
Right here! Star maps!

315
00:23:23,124 --> 00:23:24,421
Stucky.

316
00:23:24,459 --> 00:23:28,259
You got the address
to Michael Jackson's house?

317
00:23:28,296 --> 00:23:30,764
You can't come around my job!
That's harassment!

318
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:32,026
I'm just checking up on you.

319
00:23:32,066 --> 00:23:34,933
I'm fully legit now.
I'm selling star maps.

320
00:23:34,969 --> 00:23:36,129
Yeah, legit my ass.

321
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:39,867
You and your Asian gang friends
know about a kidnapping?

322
00:23:39,907 --> 00:23:41,374
I don't know nothing.

323
00:23:41,409 --> 00:23:44,105
Give me one of them star maps...

324
00:23:44,145 --> 00:23:46,079
for $45, you understand
what I'm saying?

325
00:23:46,113 --> 00:23:48,604
Don't know nothin'
about no kidnapping...

326
00:23:48,649 --> 00:23:52,107
but this dude's buying firearms,
explosives, and people...

327
00:23:52,153 --> 00:23:53,780
like he's gonna start a war.

328
00:23:53,821 --> 00:23:55,789
What's his name?

329
00:23:55,823 --> 00:23:57,688
For $45, I don't know his name.

330
00:23:57,725 --> 00:24:00,626
- You better tell me something.
- I don't know nothing for $45.

331
00:24:00,661 --> 00:24:01,753
Stucky, you don't- - 

332
00:24:03,264 --> 00:24:05,198
l didn't tell you nothin'!

333
00:24:48,943 --> 00:24:50,604
Didn't I tell you
to wait for me?

334
00:24:51,646 --> 00:24:53,614
What the hell you doing
on this bus?

335
00:24:55,149 --> 00:24:59,108
Think I'm playin' with you?

336
00:24:59,153 --> 00:25:01,553
I ain't playin' with you.
Sit down.

337
00:25:01,589 --> 00:25:03,216
OK. All right.

338
00:25:03,257 --> 00:25:04,884
it's OK.

339
00:25:04,926 --> 00:25:07,190
it's all right. FBI.

340
00:25:08,329 --> 00:25:10,320
Take a picture. it's OK.
Wait a minute.

341
00:25:17,605 --> 00:25:19,266
All right.

342
00:25:19,307 --> 00:25:20,899
What?

343
00:25:20,942 --> 00:25:22,273
Get out of my way!

344
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,578
FBI. Stop this bus.

345
00:25:40,127 --> 00:25:41,617
Hey, look.

346
00:25:42,797 --> 00:25:45,766
Hey, kids, get back in here.
Sit down.

347
00:25:53,808 --> 00:25:56,003
Stop! FBI!
l need this motorcycle.

348
00:25:56,043 --> 00:25:58,568
- No way, man.
- Get off!

349
00:26:23,938 --> 00:26:26,907
Get out of the car!
Get out of the car now!

350
00:26:26,941 --> 00:26:28,408
Where you think you're going?

351
00:26:28,442 --> 00:26:30,376
Didn't I say
to stay by the Duke?

352
00:26:30,411 --> 00:26:32,003
What do you think you're doing?

353
00:26:32,046 --> 00:26:34,446
Mind your own business.
Stay in the car.

354
00:26:34,482 --> 00:26:36,074
Hey. What you doing?

355
00:26:36,117 --> 00:26:38,642
I was trying to find out
where you was going.

356
00:26:38,686 --> 00:26:40,085
You thought
I was gonna shoot you?

357
00:26:40,121 --> 00:26:41,884
What's happening here?

358
00:26:43,124 --> 00:26:44,591
Put the gun down.

359
00:26:44,625 --> 00:26:46,525
I ain't playin' with you!

360
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,891
Think I'm playin' with you?

361
00:26:47,928 --> 00:26:49,190
Don't move!

362
00:26:51,332 --> 00:26:52,629
Drop your guns.

363
00:26:53,467 --> 00:26:55,230
Hey, man.

364
00:26:55,269 --> 00:26:57,100
Look. FBI.

365
00:26:57,138 --> 00:26:58,605
I'm policeman.

366
00:26:58,639 --> 00:27:01,767
I'm just showing him how
to take a gun from a suspect.

367
00:27:03,544 --> 00:27:05,478
All of a sudden
you speaking English?

368
00:27:05,513 --> 00:27:06,639
A little.

369
00:27:06,681 --> 00:27:08,046
My ass. You lied to me.

370
00:27:08,082 --> 00:27:10,050
l didn't say I didn't.
You assumed so.

371
00:27:10,084 --> 00:27:12,552
Assume I kick you little
Beijing ass right now.

372
00:27:12,586 --> 00:27:14,053
Man, I ain't scared of you.

373
00:27:14,088 --> 00:27:15,555
l know you know
that tricky shit.

374
00:27:15,589 --> 00:27:17,853
I'm not responsible
for your assumptions.

375
00:27:17,892 --> 00:27:20,486
You full of shit,
you understand that?

376
00:27:20,528 --> 00:27:23,895
Not being able to speak
is not the same as not speaking.

377
00:27:23,931 --> 00:27:25,922
You seem as if you like to talk.

378
00:27:25,966 --> 00:27:27,831
I let people talk
who like to talk.

379
00:27:27,868 --> 00:27:31,531
It makes it easier to find out
how full of shit they are.

380
00:27:32,606 --> 00:27:34,597
What the hell did you just say?

381
00:27:34,642 --> 00:27:36,507
I like people to talk...

382
00:27:37,945 --> 00:27:39,572
So I'm the one full of shit?

383
00:27:39,613 --> 00:27:41,080
We both full of shit.

384
00:27:41,115 --> 00:27:42,605
You full of shit.

385
00:27:44,952 --> 00:27:46,385
I'm gonna kick your ass.

386
00:27:47,455 --> 00:27:49,184
Don't nobody do that but me.

387
00:27:50,124 --> 00:27:52,285
You want me to kick your ass,
don't you?

388
00:27:57,498 --> 00:27:59,591
You must take me to see
Consul Han right away.

389
00:27:59,633 --> 00:28:03,091
Just sit there and shut up.
This ain't no democracy.

390
00:28:04,238 --> 00:28:07,036
- Yes, it is.
- No, it ain't.

391
00:28:07,074 --> 00:28:10,043
This is the United States
of James Carter now.

392
00:28:10,077 --> 00:28:13,205
I'm the president,
I'm the emperor, I'm the king.

393
00:28:13,247 --> 00:28:15,112
I'm Michael Jackson, you Tito.

394
00:28:15,149 --> 00:28:17,117
Your ass belong to me.

395
00:28:17,151 --> 00:28:19,551
Why would they not want my help?

396
00:28:19,587 --> 00:28:21,555
'Cause they don't give a damn
about you.

397
00:28:21,589 --> 00:28:23,853
They don't like you.
I don't like you.

398
00:28:23,891 --> 00:28:26,052
I don't care.
I'm here for the girl.

399
00:28:26,093 --> 00:28:28,653
The girI don't like you.
Nobody likes you.

400
00:28:28,696 --> 00:28:31,062
You came all the way
over here for nothing.

401
00:28:31,098 --> 00:28:32,963
You ain't gonna be- - 

402
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,230
Beach Boys.

403
00:28:35,269 --> 00:28:37,066
Oh, hell, no.

404
00:28:37,104 --> 00:28:38,662
You didn't just touch
my goddamn radio.

405
00:28:38,706 --> 00:28:41,072
The Beach Boys
are great American music.

406
00:28:41,108 --> 00:28:43,576
The Beach Boys'll get you
a great ass- whoopin'.

407
00:28:43,611 --> 00:28:45,909
Don't you ever touch
a black man's radio, boy.

408
00:28:45,946 --> 00:28:47,573
You can do that in China...

409
00:28:47,615 --> 00:28:50,083
but you'll get your ass
killed out here.

410
00:28:50,117 --> 00:28:52,108
Let me show you real music.

411
00:28:53,621 --> 00:28:55,612
That's real music.
You hear that?

412
00:29:06,033 --> 00:29:10,026
Now can you do that
to the Beach Boys?

413
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,560
Hell no!

414
00:29:25,085 --> 00:29:28,054
l must get to the consulate.
What are we doing here?

415
00:29:28,088 --> 00:29:31,057
it's called a shakedown.
Very serious police work.

416
00:29:31,091 --> 00:29:34,117
Just watch me handle my business
and patrol this place.

417
00:29:34,161 --> 00:29:35,958
I want to help
with the investigation.

418
00:29:35,996 --> 00:29:37,429
This is my case.

419
00:29:39,099 --> 00:29:42,398
Your case?
Look, you can back me up.

420
00:29:42,436 --> 00:29:46,930
When we get in here,
follow my lead and do what I do.

421
00:29:53,113 --> 00:29:54,580
What's up, my nigger?

422
00:29:54,615 --> 00:29:55,604
What's up?

423
00:29:57,952 --> 00:29:59,214
ls this weed?

424
00:29:59,253 --> 00:30:00,413
What?

425
00:30:03,958 --> 00:30:06,791
You got a prescription for this?
Where is it?

426
00:30:07,828 --> 00:30:09,261
Where is it?

427
00:30:09,296 --> 00:30:10,422
Where?

428
00:30:10,464 --> 00:30:11,795
Where?

429
00:30:14,001 --> 00:30:15,195
Where? Where?

430
00:30:15,236 --> 00:30:17,727
- l should take your ass to jail.
- For what?

431
00:30:17,771 --> 00:30:18,897
For what? Look at this!

432
00:30:18,939 --> 00:30:21,499
- That's nothing but a cigarette.
- This ciga- weed!

433
00:30:21,542 --> 00:30:22,804
Well, it look like cigarette.

434
00:30:22,843 --> 00:30:24,834
- You better have glaucoma.
- I do.

435
00:30:30,317 --> 00:30:31,648
What's up, my nigger?

436
00:30:34,655 --> 00:30:36,452
Hey, check that, baby.

437
00:30:43,163 --> 00:30:45,393
What's happening, Carter?

438
00:30:45,432 --> 00:30:48,731
Put the guns down!

439
00:30:48,769 --> 00:30:51,966
M.C. Hammer there,
put the goddamn gun down.

440
00:30:52,006 --> 00:30:54,133
Now, I got some questions,
and I need some answers.

441
00:30:54,174 --> 00:30:55,402
Put 'em down.

442
00:30:55,442 --> 00:30:57,967
Where the girl?
The little girl.

443
00:30:58,012 --> 00:31:00,037
- What little girl?
- The little Chinese girl.

444
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,775
I don't know nothin'
about no Chinese girl.

445
00:31:01,815 --> 00:31:03,612
Don't act like you don't know.

446
00:31:03,651 --> 00:31:05,448
I'll take your asses in
if I don't get answers.

447
00:31:05,486 --> 00:31:07,044
Carter, put the gun down.

448
00:31:07,087 --> 00:31:10,215
Don't act like you know me.
You don't know me.

449
00:31:10,257 --> 00:31:11,588
l see what's going on here.

450
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:13,593
Y'all trying to play me
like a fool.

451
00:31:13,627 --> 00:31:15,754
Lee, go outside real quick.

452
00:31:15,796 --> 00:31:17,593
it's gonna get
a little dangerous in here.

453
00:31:17,631 --> 00:31:18,757
l may have ques- - 

454
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,596
Lee, go and wait by the bar.

455
00:31:20,634 --> 00:31:23,102
Remember what I told you?
Back me up.

456
00:31:23,137 --> 00:31:24,434
I'll take care of everything.

457
00:31:24,471 --> 00:31:25,597
You're sure?

458
00:31:25,639 --> 00:31:27,106
I'm sure. Go on now.

459
00:31:27,141 --> 00:31:28,938
Go on!

460
00:31:28,976 --> 00:31:30,466
Think I'm playing?

461
00:31:30,511 --> 00:31:32,138
Hurry up!

462
00:31:38,152 --> 00:31:39,312
Come here.

463
00:31:39,353 --> 00:31:42,117
Don't come in my business
scaring me like that.

464
00:31:42,156 --> 00:31:44,124
I was just playin'.
Man, give me a hug.

465
00:31:44,158 --> 00:31:46,285
Just schoolin' the rookie,
showing him the ropes.

466
00:31:46,327 --> 00:31:48,022
Why you didn't
come to church Sunday?

467
00:31:48,062 --> 00:31:50,622
l had some things
to take care of.

468
00:31:50,664 --> 00:31:52,598
But I made the night service.

469
00:31:52,633 --> 00:31:55,124
Yeah. Come here,
l wanna holler at you.

470
00:31:55,169 --> 00:31:56,295
What's up?

471
00:31:56,337 --> 00:31:59,932
Who's this guy buying up
these explosives and weapons?

472
00:31:59,974 --> 00:32:01,566
I don't know nothing
about that.

473
00:32:01,608 --> 00:32:04,338
Luke, I know what you do.

474
00:32:04,378 --> 00:32:06,573
The only reason
why I ain't busted your ass...

475
00:32:06,613 --> 00:32:09,013
'cause you my cousin,
and it'd kill Aunt Bootsy.

476
00:32:10,117 --> 00:32:12,085
Why you gonna put
Aunt Bootsy in this?

477
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:13,416
Luke, I ain't playin'.

478
00:32:13,454 --> 00:32:17,185
l know she got a bad heart,
but I will bust your ass.

479
00:32:17,224 --> 00:32:18,782
Tell me something.

480
00:32:21,128 --> 00:32:25,087
The word down in Chinatown is
there's this new dude in town.

481
00:32:25,132 --> 00:32:29,228
Bad- ass dude outta Hong Kong
buying up every goddamn thing.

482
00:32:29,269 --> 00:32:30,167
What's his name?

483
00:32:30,204 --> 00:32:32,297
Don't know.
He ain't buying shit from me.

484
00:32:32,339 --> 00:32:34,432
- You don't know his name?
- No.

485
00:32:34,475 --> 00:32:35,942
Don't nobody know his name.

486
00:32:43,984 --> 00:32:45,781
What's up, my nigger?

487
00:32:47,321 --> 00:32:48,754
What did you just say?

488
00:32:50,157 --> 00:32:52,887
What's up, my nigger?

489
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,597
Come here!
You better watch your mouth!

490
00:33:08,776 --> 00:33:09,902
What you say, boy?

491
00:33:09,943 --> 00:33:11,638
I don't want trouble.

492
00:34:00,661 --> 00:34:02,492
Please...

493
00:34:02,529 --> 00:34:04,258
I said I don't want trouble.

494
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,761
That's bad for you.

495
00:34:12,072 --> 00:34:14,506
- Where the little girl at?
- What little girl?

496
00:34:14,541 --> 00:34:16,736
You know what girl
I'm talking about.

497
00:34:16,777 --> 00:34:19,746
Man, you better take
your goddamn hands off my suit.

498
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,577
Your mama bought me this
for Christmas.

499
00:34:21,615 --> 00:34:23,446
This is my favorite suit.

500
00:34:24,151 --> 00:34:26,915
I'll see you Thanksgiving.
Appreciate it.

501
00:34:26,954 --> 00:34:29,081
Get your big
Happy- Meal ass over!

502
00:34:29,123 --> 00:34:30,590
Get over in the corner!

503
00:34:30,624 --> 00:34:32,091
I'm still the law around here!

504
00:34:32,126 --> 00:34:34,594
Next time I come here,
y'all better clean this up!

505
00:34:34,628 --> 00:34:36,095
And brush your teeth!

506
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:37,119
Let's go.

507
00:34:41,635 --> 00:34:44,536
- What are we doing here?
- I'm getting something to eat.

508
00:34:44,571 --> 00:34:47,836
You want anything,
like a Cup O'Noodles?

509
00:34:47,875 --> 00:34:51,971
Carter, stop wasting my time.
l made a promise to Soo Yung.

510
00:34:52,012 --> 00:34:54,412
You're right.
l have been wasting your time.

511
00:34:54,448 --> 00:34:57,281
I'm sorry. Just let me
go get something to eat.

512
00:34:57,317 --> 00:34:59,581
When I come back out, I'll take
you wherever you want to go.

513
00:35:01,788 --> 00:35:02,914
Shake on it?

514
00:35:04,892 --> 00:35:06,553
Hey, what are you doing?

515
00:35:06,593 --> 00:35:09,426
You ain't the only one
with quick hands, are you?

516
00:35:09,463 --> 00:35:11,090
I'll be right back.

517
00:35:18,105 --> 00:35:21,131
Hey, man, I got you
a beef- and- bean burrito.

518
00:35:33,754 --> 00:35:35,483
We have a taxicab approaching.

519
00:35:35,522 --> 00:35:39,583
A man stepping out- - Asian.
About 5'10".

520
00:35:39,626 --> 00:35:41,423
We've got someone
approaching the gate.

521
00:35:41,461 --> 00:35:42,792
Dropped off by a cab.

522
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,290
Tell them to intercept.

523
00:35:48,335 --> 00:35:49,495
lntercept.

524
00:35:49,536 --> 00:35:51,163
We will intercept.

525
00:35:56,643 --> 00:35:58,110
Can I help you?

526
00:35:58,145 --> 00:36:00,909
- Yes. I must see the consul.
- About what?

527
00:36:00,948 --> 00:36:03,246
Please, it's very important.

528
00:36:03,283 --> 00:36:06,377
Why don't you tell us
why you need to see the consul?

529
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,910
We'll tell you
whether it's important.

530
00:36:07,955 --> 00:36:10,014
Do you have identification?

531
00:36:11,091 --> 00:36:13,025
it's about his daughter
Soo Yung.

532
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,527
Hands above your head!

533
00:36:14,561 --> 00:36:15,960
He asked about
the consul's daughter.

534
00:36:15,996 --> 00:36:17,122
He asked about the daughter.

535
00:36:17,164 --> 00:36:18,995
You don't understand.
I was invited.

536
00:36:24,104 --> 00:36:26,095
Don't move! Throw your gun away.

537
00:36:26,139 --> 00:36:29,404
- He's gonna kill them.
- ls everything all right?

538
00:36:29,443 --> 00:36:31,411
You'll be safer
on the second floor.

539
00:36:31,445 --> 00:36:33,470
I'm sorry.

540
00:36:33,513 --> 00:36:35,310
I'm sorry about this.

541
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:58,097
He went over.

542
00:36:58,138 --> 00:36:59,298
Let's go!

543
00:37:00,674 --> 00:37:03,040
He's on the grounds! Come on!

544
00:37:33,206 --> 00:37:35,071
Stay away from the window,
please.

545
00:37:35,108 --> 00:37:36,268
Right here.

546
00:37:42,115 --> 00:37:43,446
Get down! Now!

547
00:37:58,131 --> 00:37:59,291
Don't move!

548
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:15,546
I think there has been
a misunderstanding.

549
00:38:15,582 --> 00:38:17,550
it's all right. it's OK.

550
00:38:17,584 --> 00:38:20,280
it's him. The guy from China.

551
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,015
What?

552
00:38:22,055 --> 00:38:23,920
Come in, please.

553
00:38:28,095 --> 00:38:32,794
Mr. Russ, I would like you
to meet Detective Inspector Lee.

554
00:38:32,833 --> 00:38:34,698
Excuse me very much.

555
00:38:37,871 --> 00:38:39,099
Your gun.

556
00:38:43,777 --> 00:38:45,938
Where the hell is Carter?

557
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,179
Then I gotta put up with this.

558
00:38:56,957 --> 00:38:59,084
Seen a little Asian dude
about this height...

559
00:38:59,126 --> 00:39:00,889
with a steering wheel
on his arm?

560
00:39:00,927 --> 00:39:02,827
Go screw yourself.

561
00:39:02,863 --> 00:39:04,763
What you say?

562
00:39:04,798 --> 00:39:06,197
I said go screw yourself.

563
00:39:06,233 --> 00:39:09,100
You take your sensitive ass
up there and let me in!

564
00:39:09,136 --> 00:39:11,036
Don't make me get up
out of this truck!

565
00:39:11,071 --> 00:39:12,333
Let this putz in.

566
00:39:12,372 --> 00:39:14,863
Man, when I get up in here,
I'm slapping somebody.

567
00:39:15,575 --> 00:39:17,042
What happened, Carter?

568
00:39:17,077 --> 00:39:19,170
I ain't supposed to be
jumping on buses!

569
00:39:19,212 --> 00:39:22,045
I do not do that!
I am not Carl Lewis!

570
00:39:22,082 --> 00:39:23,811
Who is this man?

571
00:39:24,618 --> 00:39:26,051
Sir, I can explain.

572
00:39:26,086 --> 00:39:28,554
Agent Carter has been helping
with my investigation.

573
00:39:28,588 --> 00:39:31,455
He's upset that we have not
done our job.

574
00:39:31,491 --> 00:39:34,483
Me and Lee are taking care
of the situation.

575
00:39:34,528 --> 00:39:36,723
We have everything
under control.

576
00:39:36,763 --> 00:39:38,492
We'll get your daughter back
safe and sound.

577
00:39:38,532 --> 00:39:41,262
He is very passionate
about finding your daughter.

578
00:39:41,301 --> 00:39:43,565
Well, I owe you my gratitude.

579
00:39:43,603 --> 00:39:47,061
We wanted Detective Lee to have
one of our best men by his side.

580
00:39:47,107 --> 00:39:49,075
Agent Russ,
maybe this is a good time...

581
00:39:49,109 --> 00:39:51,168
to tell him
the details of my assignment.

582
00:39:53,613 --> 00:39:55,581
Can I speak to you
for a moment?

583
00:39:55,615 --> 00:39:57,344
You wanna speak to me?
For a moment?

584
00:39:57,384 --> 00:39:58,612
In private?

585
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:03,749
Oh, I see!
This must be G- 14 classified.

586
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:05,314
FBI- type stuff.

587
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:09,089
Let me call my captain
and let him know what going on.

588
00:40:09,129 --> 00:40:13,429
We'll talk in a second.
When a G- 14 comes around.

589
00:40:13,467 --> 00:40:14,627
Who's this? Hello?

590
00:40:14,668 --> 00:40:16,693
Am I speaking with FBI?

591
00:40:16,736 --> 00:40:19,603
- Give me the phone.
- Yeah, this is the FBI.

592
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:21,368
You are FBI?

593
00:40:21,408 --> 00:40:23,103
Yeah, this is the FBI.

594
00:40:23,143 --> 00:40:26,601
If you want the girl back alive,
listen and do not talk.

595
00:40:26,646 --> 00:40:28,136
OK, I'm listening.
Let me get a pen.

596
00:40:29,149 --> 00:40:30,616
All right. Cool.

597
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:33,949
The drop will be made tonight.
11:00 p.m.

598
00:40:33,987 --> 00:40:36,478
The amount will be $50 million.

599
00:40:36,523 --> 00:40:38,115
Fifty million dollars?

600
00:40:38,158 --> 00:40:40,854
Who you think you kidnapped,
Chelsea Clinton?

601
00:40:40,894 --> 00:40:42,122
Keep him talking.

602
00:40:42,162 --> 00:40:44,630
In used currency.
Nothing bigger than a 50.

603
00:40:44,664 --> 00:40:47,690
All right. Cool.
Fifty million. No problem.

604
00:40:47,734 --> 00:40:50,965
I want 20 million in 50s...

605
00:40:51,004 --> 00:40:52,494
Twenty million in 50s.

606
00:40:52,539 --> 00:40:54,666
Twenty million in 20s...

607
00:40:54,708 --> 00:40:56,175
Twenty million in 20s.

608
00:40:56,209 --> 00:40:58,302
And 10 million in 10s.

609
00:40:58,345 --> 00:41:00,142
Ten million in 10s.

610
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,977
You want any fries with that?

611
00:41:02,015 --> 00:41:03,414
What is your name?

612
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:06,180
You called us.
Why you want to know my name?

613
00:41:06,219 --> 00:41:09,188
I just want to be able to tell
the consul who is responsible...

614
00:41:09,222 --> 00:41:11,588
for his daughter's death
because he talk too much.

615
00:41:11,625 --> 00:41:13,593
All right, hold up. Calm down.

616
00:41:13,627 --> 00:41:16,061
I'm trying to hook you up.
I'm on your side.

617
00:41:16,096 --> 00:41:18,087
You will receive instructions
for the drop...

618
00:41:18,131 --> 00:41:21,100
half an hour
before it is to be made.

619
00:41:21,134 --> 00:41:24,228
If it is successful,
the girl will live.

620
00:41:24,271 --> 00:41:26,102
I'm gonna make sure
you get the money...

621
00:41:26,139 --> 00:41:28,107
and we can spend it
together when you do...

622
00:41:28,141 --> 00:41:30,336
'cause I don't even
really work for them.

623
00:41:31,645 --> 00:41:34,341
We got it.
620 South Broadway. Downtown.

624
00:41:45,659 --> 00:41:50,119
Team one, proceed down 6th
to 6th and Broadway.

625
00:41:50,163 --> 00:41:53,621
Team two, I want you around
the back on 4th and Main.

626
00:41:53,667 --> 00:41:55,134
Set up a perimeter.

627
00:41:55,168 --> 00:41:58,069
Take your team and cover
the building floor by floor...

628
00:41:58,104 --> 00:41:59,833
all the way to the top. Move.

629
00:42:08,148 --> 00:42:09,615
Two men around back.

630
00:42:09,649 --> 00:42:11,116
They must not go
into the building.

631
00:42:11,151 --> 00:42:13,779
Yeah, you right.
Let's go tell them. Come on.

632
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,515
Take positions on the corner.

633
00:42:17,524 --> 00:42:20,152
Mr. Russ, you must pull
your men back.

634
00:42:20,193 --> 00:42:22,093
What the hell
are you doing here?

635
00:42:22,128 --> 00:42:24,028
Where's Carter?

636
00:42:26,833 --> 00:42:28,630
Please, listen to me.

637
00:42:28,668 --> 00:42:31,136
You may be very competent,
but the mere fact...

638
00:42:31,171 --> 00:42:34,231
that you know this girl
compromises your judgment.

639
00:42:39,379 --> 00:42:43,110
Sir, if you were asking
for $50 million dollars...

640
00:42:43,149 --> 00:42:44,844
would you be in a place
like that?

641
00:42:44,884 --> 00:42:47,011
Get this clown away from me.

642
00:42:47,053 --> 00:42:48,247
Take a hike!

643
00:42:57,864 --> 00:42:59,126
Hey, man.

644
00:42:59,165 --> 00:43:00,462
Why were you hiding?

645
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,058
What you talking about?
I wasn't hiding.

646
00:43:02,102 --> 00:43:03,330
You were hiding.

647
00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:05,361
l bent down to tie my shoe.

648
00:43:05,405 --> 00:43:07,396
Sir, the area is secured.

649
00:43:08,141 --> 00:43:09,108
Room's empty.

650
00:43:09,142 --> 00:43:10,473
Damn it!

651
00:43:28,762 --> 00:43:30,195
Everybody pull back!

652
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:31,390
Goddamn!

653
00:43:31,431 --> 00:43:33,524
Get some paramedics
down here now!

654
00:43:33,566 --> 00:43:35,397
Evacuate the building
right away!

655
00:43:35,435 --> 00:43:36,902
Get fire crews here!

656
00:43:36,936 --> 00:43:39,734
We got an explosion
at 6th and Broadway.

657
00:44:42,969 --> 00:44:45,096
That ain't far enough, man!

658
00:44:45,138 --> 00:44:48,130
I ain't Kareem Abdul- Jabbar!
Push it down some more!

659
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:53,495
Carter, don't come any- - Stop!

660
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:55,405
What the hell you- - 

661
00:46:18,031 --> 00:46:20,261
I think I done broke my shit.

662
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:22,393
Who was that you was chasing?

663
00:46:22,435 --> 00:46:26,462
His name is Sang from Hong Kong.
Because of you he got away.

664
00:46:26,506 --> 00:46:28,770
Why you ain't tell me
about the bridge?

665
00:46:28,808 --> 00:46:31,208
- I did.
- No, you didn't.

666
00:46:31,244 --> 00:46:32,404
I said stop.

667
00:46:32,445 --> 00:46:34,072
I don't understand
what you be saying.

668
00:46:34,113 --> 00:46:35,740
What?

669
00:46:35,782 --> 00:46:38,512
You see what I'm saying?

670
00:46:38,551 --> 00:46:40,041
What's this in your hand?

671
00:46:40,086 --> 00:46:41,951
He dropped it.

672
00:46:41,988 --> 00:46:43,182
Oh, shit.

673
00:46:43,223 --> 00:46:45,885
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

674
00:46:45,925 --> 00:46:47,290
I messed up my suit.

675
00:46:58,037 --> 00:46:59,766
Fifteen seconds.

676
00:47:06,045 --> 00:47:07,706
Make a decision.

677
00:47:14,854 --> 00:47:16,185
Oh, shit!

678
00:47:18,358 --> 00:47:20,019
Did I come at a bad time?

679
00:47:20,059 --> 00:47:23,460
I got bad news for you, Johnson.
We're all dead.

680
00:47:23,496 --> 00:47:25,361
I was distracted, sir.

681
00:47:25,398 --> 00:47:27,366
Distractions can occur
in the field.

682
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,300
That's why
we call this practice.

683
00:47:29,335 --> 00:47:31,735
If you can't handle
the pressure, then quit.

684
00:47:31,771 --> 00:47:32,965
Yes, sir.

685
00:47:33,006 --> 00:47:35,804
Man, give her a break.
Don't worry about him.

686
00:47:35,842 --> 00:47:38,777
How you doing, girl?
Give me some love.

687
00:47:38,811 --> 00:47:40,438
Why are you tormenting me?

688
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,970
That any way to treat
an old friend?

689
00:47:42,015 --> 00:47:45,143
I came to see how you was doing,
and I need some help.

690
00:47:45,184 --> 00:47:46,981
Help?

691
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:49,215
I know that you have
strong feelings for me...

692
00:47:49,255 --> 00:47:51,052
but we gotta put that aside.

693
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:52,751
it's a little girl's life
at stake here.

694
00:47:52,792 --> 00:47:55,226
Since when do care about anybody
but yourself?

695
00:47:55,261 --> 00:47:57,525
Please just take a look at this.

696
00:47:57,563 --> 00:48:00,396
We found this on a kidnapper.
Tell me what this is.

697
00:48:00,433 --> 00:48:03,732
You want me to work with you?
I don't have time for this.

698
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:05,601
I got enough shit to deal with.

699
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:08,939
Who are you?

700
00:48:08,975 --> 00:48:11,500
- Sorry we got you in trouble.
- Yeah, he's sorry.

701
00:48:11,544 --> 00:48:13,239
Tell me something
about this I don't know.

702
00:48:13,279 --> 00:48:16,146
A remote. Could be nitro cap,
could be cross- delayed...

703
00:48:16,182 --> 00:48:18,173
definitely not homemade,
definitely not American.

704
00:48:18,217 --> 00:48:21,550
It could open up a garage door,
or blow up some C- 4.

705
00:48:21,587 --> 00:48:23,282
C- 4?

706
00:48:23,323 --> 00:48:24,847
Yeah, C- 4.

707
00:48:26,759 --> 00:48:29,250
This means so much to me.

708
00:48:30,763 --> 00:48:33,254
Hey, and I'm sorry about
spreading all those rumors...

709
00:48:33,299 --> 00:48:35,233
on Christmas about us
sleeping together.

710
00:48:35,268 --> 00:48:36,530
What?!

711
00:48:36,569 --> 00:48:38,036
He's just joking.

712
00:48:45,345 --> 00:48:47,438
Hey, Bobby, what's up, man?

713
00:48:48,915 --> 00:48:52,442
- I need to see Clive Cod.
- No way, Carter.

714
00:48:52,485 --> 00:48:54,453
it's lights out.
They're locked down.

715
00:48:54,487 --> 00:48:55,613
You want me to lose my job?

716
00:48:55,655 --> 00:48:59,284
I got you this damn job.
You better let me in here.

717
00:48:59,325 --> 00:49:00,690
Can't do it.

718
00:49:00,727 --> 00:49:03,355
Didn't I turn my back when
you bought that bag of weed?

719
00:49:03,396 --> 00:49:05,694
I was splitting it with you.

720
00:49:05,732 --> 00:49:07,165
Didn't I give you
the bigger half?

721
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,168
Do me this favor.

722
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:13,364
Shit. You got five minutes.

723
00:49:13,406 --> 00:49:15,203
Hey, Cod.

724
00:49:15,241 --> 00:49:17,072
Your two brothers
are here to see you.

725
00:49:22,849 --> 00:49:25,909
Clive, how you doing, man?

726
00:49:25,952 --> 00:49:28,011
You got a lot of balls,
coming here.

727
00:49:28,054 --> 00:49:31,046
I was just around the way.
Figured you would be bored.

728
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:33,320
l came to see how you was doing.

729
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:34,758
What the helI do you want?

730
00:49:34,794 --> 00:49:36,455
I just came to bring you a gift.

731
00:49:36,496 --> 00:49:39,659
I know you got time to kill.
I brought you a toy.

732
00:49:39,699 --> 00:49:41,530
- I don't want that.
- You don't?

733
00:49:41,567 --> 00:49:43,592
Somebody told me
you like this stuff.

734
00:49:43,636 --> 00:49:46,662
I don't like stuff like that.
I don't even know what it is.

735
00:49:46,706 --> 00:49:48,196
You never sold this to nobody?

736
00:49:48,241 --> 00:49:50,402
How could I,
when I don't know what it is?

737
00:49:50,443 --> 00:49:52,502
- Hold it.
- I don't want to hold it.

738
00:49:52,545 --> 00:49:55,412
- Just touch it.
- I don't want to touch it.

739
00:49:55,448 --> 00:49:57,643
- You scared of it?
- You think I'm stupid?

740
00:49:57,683 --> 00:49:58,809
Stupid enough to get busted.

741
00:49:58,851 --> 00:50:00,910
You want my fingerprints
so you can frame me.

742
00:50:00,953 --> 00:50:02,477
Why would I do something
like that?

743
00:50:02,522 --> 00:50:04,080
Think I would try
tricking you again?

744
00:50:04,123 --> 00:50:05,715
I don't have to frame you.

745
00:50:05,758 --> 00:50:08,226
You'lI do life
for killing the little girl.

746
00:50:08,261 --> 00:50:09,888
I don't know anything
about a little girl.

747
00:50:09,929 --> 00:50:12,762
That ain't
what I'll tell everybody.

748
00:50:12,799 --> 00:50:14,460
I don't know anything.

749
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:15,831
I got a big mouth, Clive.

750
00:50:15,868 --> 00:50:17,028
Let me tell you something.

751
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:20,062
I don't know anything,
so you can kiss my fat ass.

752
00:50:20,106 --> 00:50:22,506
It'd take me all day
to kiss your fat ass.

753
00:50:22,542 --> 00:50:24,237
You want some of this?

754
00:50:24,277 --> 00:50:25,972
I'll give you all you want.

755
00:50:26,012 --> 00:50:27,570
Give me a name.

756
00:50:27,613 --> 00:50:29,376
I ain't telling you shit.

757
00:50:32,285 --> 00:50:33,912
She's only 11 years old.

758
00:50:33,953 --> 00:50:36,183
I don't want her to die.

759
00:50:36,222 --> 00:50:38,486
Look at the picture.

760
00:50:38,524 --> 00:50:40,617
I don't care about him or you.

761
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:42,890
l care about the little girl.

762
00:50:42,929 --> 00:50:45,124
Give me the name.

763
00:50:54,674 --> 00:50:56,835
The guy's name is Juntao.

764
00:50:56,876 --> 00:50:58,571
I never seen him.

765
00:50:58,611 --> 00:50:59,908
Where can I find him?

766
00:50:59,946 --> 00:51:01,880
Foo Chow Restaurant.
Chinatown.

767
00:51:01,914 --> 00:51:03,142
Foo Chow Restaurant?

768
00:51:03,182 --> 00:51:05,878
Get rid of this guy.
He'll get you killed.

769
00:51:05,918 --> 00:51:08,546
Clive, thank you, man.
I'm gonna come back.

770
00:51:08,588 --> 00:51:10,920
I'm gonna bring your fat ass
some cookies.

771
00:51:29,575 --> 00:51:30,803
That's it right there.

772
00:51:35,715 --> 00:51:37,740
What are we waiting for?

773
00:51:37,783 --> 00:51:41,344
We scoping the place out, man.
Ain't gonna run up in there.

774
00:51:41,387 --> 00:51:43,548
That's how you get shot.

775
00:51:45,992 --> 00:51:47,323
I'm falling asleep.

776
00:52:01,307 --> 00:52:03,468
Hunh yeah.

777
00:52:03,509 --> 00:52:05,875
What is it good for?

778
00:52:05,912 --> 00:52:07,436
Absolutely nothing.

779
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:08,947
Sing it again, you all.

780
00:52:08,981 --> 00:52:12,473
War, hunh, yeah.

781
00:52:12,518 --> 00:52:14,452
What is it good for?

782
00:52:14,487 --> 00:52:15,977
Absolutely nothing.

783
00:52:16,022 --> 00:52:17,614
Sing it again, you all.

784
00:52:17,657 --> 00:52:20,854
War, hunh, yeah.

785
00:52:20,893 --> 00:52:23,521
What is it good for?
Absolutely- - 

786
00:52:23,563 --> 00:52:25,758
You don't know nothing
about no war.

787
00:52:25,798 --> 00:52:27,356
Everybody knows war.

788
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,391
Hunh, yeah.

789
00:52:29,435 --> 00:52:31,596
What is it good for?

790
00:52:31,637 --> 00:52:34,197
Absolutely nothing.

791
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,435
Good God, you all.

792
00:52:36,475 --> 00:52:38,807
It ain't you all, it's y'all.

793
00:52:42,582 --> 00:52:44,812
Man, you sound
like a karate movie. Y'all!

794
00:52:45,952 --> 00:52:47,817
Say it from right here
with some soul. Y'all.

795
00:52:51,057 --> 00:52:53,525
Let me show your goofy ass
how to do this.

796
00:52:56,662 --> 00:52:58,459
What is it good for?

797
00:52:58,497 --> 00:53:00,124
Absolutely nothing.

798
00:53:00,166 --> 00:53:01,497
Come on.

799
00:53:01,534 --> 00:53:05,061
War, hunh, yeah.

800
00:53:05,104 --> 00:53:07,072
What is it good for?

801
00:53:07,106 --> 00:53:08,835
Absolutely nothing.

802
00:53:08,874 --> 00:53:10,307
Listen to me.

803
00:53:10,343 --> 00:53:12,277
War, hunh.

804
00:53:16,115 --> 00:53:17,844
Come on, come on.

805
00:53:23,356 --> 00:53:24,584
Do that again.

806
00:53:24,624 --> 00:53:26,990
Do it again. Like this?

807
00:54:16,008 --> 00:54:17,703
One will be inserted
into the suitcase.

808
00:54:17,743 --> 00:54:20,735
The other will be on you.
Now when you make the drop- - 

809
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:25,981
Do we have it?

810
00:54:26,018 --> 00:54:27,508
All right, pick it up.

811
00:54:29,689 --> 00:54:31,156
You have what I asked for?

812
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:32,316
I do.

813
00:54:32,358 --> 00:54:34,986
I hope now you realize
how serious I am.

814
00:54:35,027 --> 00:54:36,654
Take the money to the alley...

815
00:54:36,696 --> 00:54:39,187
behind the Foo Chow Restaurant
in Chinatown.

816
00:54:39,231 --> 00:54:42,064
You have 29 minutes left.

817
00:54:55,748 --> 00:54:58,911
Damn, Chen,
this is some greasy shit.

818
00:54:58,951 --> 00:55:00,282
You ain't got no better food...

819
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:02,412
like some chicken wings,
some baby back ribs...

820
00:55:02,455 --> 00:55:04,184
some fries or something?

821
00:55:04,223 --> 00:55:06,623
Chinese food, no soul food here.

822
00:55:06,659 --> 00:55:09,253
I didn't say soul food.
I said better food.

823
00:55:09,295 --> 00:55:10,455
I don't want that greasy shit.

824
00:55:10,496 --> 00:55:12,896
How you gonna sell
a big box of grease?

825
00:55:12,932 --> 00:55:14,126
I'm chilly a what?

826
00:55:14,166 --> 00:55:16,691
Come on.

827
00:55:16,736 --> 00:55:17,964
I'm no punk bitch.

828
00:55:18,003 --> 00:55:19,402
I ain't no punk bitch neither.

829
00:55:19,438 --> 00:55:21,565
- I'm no punk bitch.
- I'll knock your hat off.

830
00:55:21,607 --> 00:55:22,733
Come on.

831
00:55:22,775 --> 00:55:24,504
Man, what you got me eating?

832
00:55:24,543 --> 00:55:25,805
That's eel.

833
00:55:25,845 --> 00:55:27,073
Is it good?

834
00:55:27,113 --> 00:55:28,444
Very good.

835
00:55:28,481 --> 00:55:30,244
What you got?

836
00:55:30,282 --> 00:55:31,613
Camel's hump.

837
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:32,912
What?

838
00:55:33,052 --> 00:55:34,952
Camel's hump.

839
00:55:41,627 --> 00:55:43,060
Kinda good.

840
00:55:43,095 --> 00:55:45,859
Need a little hot sauce,
but it's kinda good, though.

841
00:55:47,433 --> 00:55:49,731
- We still waiting?
- Yeah.

842
00:55:51,837 --> 00:55:53,668
How we gonna get Juntao?

843
00:55:53,706 --> 00:55:56,197
How we know he exists?
Ain't nobody seen him.

844
00:55:56,242 --> 00:55:58,642
I know. He killed my partner.

845
00:56:00,613 --> 00:56:02,581
I'm sorry about that, man.

846
00:56:02,615 --> 00:56:04,606
That's one reason
I don't have no partner.

847
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:06,242
That's one thing
I learned from my daddy.

848
00:56:07,453 --> 00:56:08,715
Your daddy was a policeman?

849
00:56:08,754 --> 00:56:10,551
Fifteen years LAPD.

850
00:56:10,589 --> 00:56:12,819
My father was also a policeman.

851
00:56:12,858 --> 00:56:13,984
Your daddy was a cop?

852
00:56:14,026 --> 00:56:15,550
Not a cop, an officer.

853
00:56:15,594 --> 00:56:17,459
A legend all over Hong Kong.

854
00:56:17,496 --> 00:56:19,589
My daddy a legend, too.
All over America.

855
00:56:19,632 --> 00:56:22,829
My daddy once arrested 15 people
in one night by himself.

856
00:56:22,868 --> 00:56:24,768
My daddy arrest 25 by himself.

857
00:56:25,504 --> 00:56:27,335
My daddy
saved five crackheads...

858
00:56:27,373 --> 00:56:29,136
from a burning building
by himself.

859
00:56:29,175 --> 00:56:31,973
My daddy once caught a bullet
with his bare hands.

860
00:56:32,011 --> 00:56:33,979
My daddy'll kick
your daddy's ass...

861
00:56:34,013 --> 00:56:35,674
all the way from here
to China...

862
00:56:35,714 --> 00:56:37,113
or Japan or wherever you from.

863
00:56:37,149 --> 00:56:38,776
All up that Great Wall, too.

864
00:56:38,818 --> 00:56:41,218
- Don't talk about my father.
- Don't talk about my daddy.

865
00:56:42,855 --> 00:56:45,415
Hey, that your boy?

866
00:56:45,458 --> 00:56:46,948
Yes. Let's go.

867
00:56:49,495 --> 00:56:51,895
I better go in first.
Ain't nobody gonna recognize me.

868
00:56:51,931 --> 00:56:53,899
I'll wait five minutes.

869
00:56:54,967 --> 00:56:56,434
Hey, you take my lD.

870
00:56:56,469 --> 00:56:59,905
If anything go wrong,
you bust in like you're LAPD.

871
00:57:04,577 --> 00:57:06,943
This won't work. I'm not 6'1".

872
00:57:06,979 --> 00:57:09,174
Yes, it wilI work.
it's all about attitude.

873
00:57:09,215 --> 00:57:10,705
Flip it open, flip it closed.

874
00:57:10,749 --> 00:57:12,808
Do it fast. Open, close. Fast.

875
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:16,287
You'll get it. Look.

876
00:57:16,322 --> 00:57:18,153
Take this.

877
00:57:22,261 --> 00:57:24,752
Hey, man, act like
you're from out of town.

878
00:57:24,797 --> 00:57:26,594
I am from out of town.

879
00:57:26,632 --> 00:57:28,896
Don't act like a cop.
Act like a tourist.

880
00:57:28,934 --> 00:57:31,334
Don't be so obvious. All right.

881
00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:33,065
OK, no problem.

882
00:57:34,106 --> 00:57:36,370
- Hi.
- How you doing?

883
00:57:36,408 --> 00:57:38,376
- For one?
- No, for two.

884
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:40,344
I'm here for a meeting
with Mr. Juntao.

885
00:57:40,379 --> 00:57:43,439
I'm sorry,
I don't know Mr. Juntao.

886
00:57:43,482 --> 00:57:44,744
Maybe you don't understand.

887
00:57:44,783 --> 00:57:46,512
I'm Mr. Juntao's lawyer.
Legal advisor.

888
00:57:46,552 --> 00:57:50,682
He got into some shit again.
I'm a very busy man.

889
00:57:50,723 --> 00:57:52,156
I ain't got time
to be coming down here.

890
00:57:52,191 --> 00:57:54,751
My wife wants me to come home,
baby's shitting all over.

891
00:57:54,793 --> 00:57:56,226
Would you please get Mr. Juntao?

892
00:57:56,262 --> 00:57:58,753
But I have already told you
I don't know- - 

893
00:57:58,797 --> 00:58:00,560
You think I came here
for nothing?

894
00:58:00,599 --> 00:58:02,032
You gonna give me gas money?

895
00:58:02,067 --> 00:58:03,500
You got $5.00 on you?

896
00:58:03,536 --> 00:58:06,437
Would you please go tell
Mr. Juntao to get his ass here?

897
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:10,070
Thank you.

898
00:58:10,109 --> 00:58:11,269
Can I sit right here?

899
00:58:11,310 --> 00:58:13,175
Right here? Thank you.

900
00:58:15,948 --> 00:58:17,916
- Hi.
- Y'alI got any eel?

901
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:19,178
Sure.

902
00:58:19,218 --> 00:58:22,085
How's your camel hump?

903
00:58:23,556 --> 00:58:24,921
Excuse me?

904
00:58:24,957 --> 00:58:27,824
Where is Roscoe's
Chicken and Waffles?

905
00:58:29,328 --> 00:58:31,922
This way?

906
00:58:31,964 --> 00:58:35,229
I'm sorry.
I'm from out of town.

907
00:58:35,267 --> 00:58:37,531
Thank you.

908
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:39,504
Welcome.

909
00:58:39,538 --> 00:58:40,971
What's that?

910
00:59:21,847 --> 00:59:23,610
No, wait.

911
00:59:29,188 --> 00:59:31,850
Get the girl out of here.

912
00:59:31,890 --> 00:59:35,291
Make sure those two don't leave.

913
01:00:28,681 --> 01:00:30,911
Juntao will see you.

914
01:00:30,949 --> 01:00:32,246
it's about time.

915
01:00:46,165 --> 01:00:47,462
Stop it!

916
01:00:47,499 --> 01:00:49,330
Let me go!

917
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:04,349
This is tight.
Ain't nothing like downstairs.

918
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:05,907
Y'alI got it going- - 

919
01:01:06,952 --> 01:01:09,216
What's up, man?
What y'all watching?

920
01:01:14,993 --> 01:01:16,961
Where Juntao at?

921
01:01:20,466 --> 01:01:22,457
Why y'all so quiet?

922
01:01:27,773 --> 01:01:29,331
That was childish, man.

923
01:01:29,374 --> 01:01:31,069
That wasn't even called for!

924
01:01:31,110 --> 01:01:34,477
Now I came down here
to see Juntao...

925
01:01:34,513 --> 01:01:36,242
'cause he told me
to come down here...

926
01:01:36,281 --> 01:01:38,977
'cause I'm his half- brother
from Beijing.

927
01:01:39,017 --> 01:01:42,418
Me and him got the same mama.
I'm Blackinese.

928
01:01:42,454 --> 01:01:44,979
We all the same. Whoa.
Wait a minute.

929
01:01:45,023 --> 01:01:46,718
OK, you gonna kill me?

930
01:01:46,759 --> 01:01:48,659
OK, put the gun down,
fight me like a man.

931
01:01:49,762 --> 01:01:52,060
That's right,
fight me like a man. Shit!

932
01:01:52,097 --> 01:01:55,589
Anybody can shoot somebody.
That's what I'm talking about.

933
01:01:55,634 --> 01:01:57,625
Back. Give me some room.

934
01:01:57,669 --> 01:01:59,466
You don't know
who you messing with.

935
01:01:59,505 --> 01:02:00,665
I'm gonna knock that yellow- - 

936
01:02:04,777 --> 01:02:06,540
Which one of y'all kicked me?

937
01:02:06,578 --> 01:02:08,341
Me.

938
01:02:10,749 --> 01:02:13,217
OK. All right.

939
01:02:24,363 --> 01:02:25,921
Hold on. Let's talk about this.

940
01:02:25,964 --> 01:02:28,626
Let's talk about this, man.

941
01:02:28,667 --> 01:02:30,692
No, no. What that mean?

942
01:02:30,736 --> 01:02:32,033
Hey, man,
this is a misunderstanding.

943
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:33,628
Come on, let's pray about this.

944
01:02:35,841 --> 01:02:37,206
FBI, huh?

945
01:02:37,242 --> 01:02:38,709
No, I ain't FBI.

946
01:02:38,744 --> 01:02:41,042
I'm a security guard,
I work at the mall.

947
01:02:41,079 --> 01:02:42,603
Now wipe yourself off.

948
01:02:43,949 --> 01:02:45,940
You're bleeding.

949
01:02:53,926 --> 01:02:55,689
Oh, hell naw.

950
01:02:55,727 --> 01:02:57,922
He just playing, man.
He ain't mean that.

951
01:02:57,963 --> 01:02:59,760
He meant cut me loose.
Let me go.

952
01:02:59,798 --> 01:03:01,493
No, no!

953
01:03:01,533 --> 01:03:02,693
LAPD.

954
01:03:13,812 --> 01:03:15,245
What you doing?

955
01:03:58,123 --> 01:03:59,283
Watch out!

956
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,684
Behind you.

957
01:04:09,468 --> 01:04:11,436
Freeze!

958
01:04:11,470 --> 01:04:13,529
We kicked y'all ass.

959
01:04:13,572 --> 01:04:15,096
All y'all.

960
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:16,801
Y'alI got your ass kicked.

961
01:04:22,614 --> 01:04:23,774
Oh, shit.

962
01:04:27,019 --> 01:04:28,316
Hey, man!

963
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:36,692
I'm gonna kill your ass.

964
01:05:04,022 --> 01:05:05,785
Lee! Over here, man!

965
01:05:05,824 --> 01:05:07,348
Move! Move!

966
01:05:21,606 --> 01:05:23,096
Is that my gun?

967
01:05:24,943 --> 01:05:27,002
- It is my gun.
- Let's go.

968
01:05:31,083 --> 01:05:34,348
Why you gotta drop
the goddamn badge?

969
01:05:34,386 --> 01:05:36,513
Then you threw the gun
out the window.

970
01:05:38,023 --> 01:05:39,888
Come on, this way.

971
01:05:47,766 --> 01:05:50,997
I got everything under control.
Don't worry about nothing.

972
01:05:51,036 --> 01:05:53,504
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!

973
01:05:53,538 --> 01:05:54,698
it's cool.

974
01:05:54,740 --> 01:05:56,935
Why am I not surprised
to find you here, Carter?

975
01:05:56,975 --> 01:06:01,105
Dan, I want these two back
at the consulate immediately.

976
01:06:03,015 --> 01:06:04,778
Let's take a ride, gentlemen.

977
01:06:20,165 --> 01:06:23,760
You better get your hand off me.
Hey, man, he with me.

978
01:06:29,708 --> 01:06:32,575
Just let me explain.
I'll start from the top.

979
01:06:32,611 --> 01:06:35,079
We were making the drop.
Han was about to get her back...

980
01:06:35,113 --> 01:06:36,978
and you two screwed it up.

981
01:06:37,015 --> 01:06:39,575
What you talking about?
Didn't you hear what Lee said?

982
01:06:39,618 --> 01:06:42,451
Mr. Lee is on his way
to Hong Kong.

983
01:06:42,487 --> 01:06:44,478
Now get out of here
before I file...

984
01:06:44,523 --> 01:06:46,684
obstruction of justice charges
against you.

985
01:06:46,725 --> 01:06:48,989
We was about to solve the case.
All we need to do- - 

986
01:06:49,027 --> 01:06:51,723
You're no longer
on this assignment, Carter.

987
01:06:51,763 --> 01:06:53,287
Case closed.

988
01:07:10,382 --> 01:07:13,010
- Consul Han!
- Sorry, sir.

989
01:07:15,587 --> 01:07:17,316
It was all my fault.

990
01:07:17,355 --> 01:07:19,687
Lee would never do anything to
jeopardize your daughter's life.

991
01:07:19,724 --> 01:07:21,351
He loves your daughter.

992
01:07:21,393 --> 01:07:24,590
it's a little too late
for apologies.

993
01:07:25,797 --> 01:07:29,289
Consul...you have a call.

994
01:07:29,334 --> 01:07:30,961
We're ready.

995
01:07:31,002 --> 01:07:33,436
OK, pick it up.

996
01:07:36,641 --> 01:07:40,737
The ransom is now 70 million.
I will call with instructions.

997
01:07:40,779 --> 01:07:43,771
You deliver the money or pick up
the body of your daughter.

998
01:07:43,815 --> 01:07:47,216
Please. You must understand.
What happened tonight was not- - 

999
01:07:51,990 --> 01:07:56,950
Soo Yung, please tell them
l wilI do whatever- - 

1000
01:08:20,285 --> 01:08:23,049
Sorry, man.

1001
01:08:23,088 --> 01:08:25,079
Be sorry for Soo Yung.

1002
01:08:50,115 --> 01:08:52,310
No hard leads.

1003
01:08:52,350 --> 01:08:53,510
None.

1004
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:59,251
Listen, we're doing
all we can here, all right?

1005
01:08:59,291 --> 01:09:01,851
Tracing everything that's coming
into this compound.

1006
01:09:01,893 --> 01:09:04,191
Excuse me, Consul.
You have a guest.

1007
01:09:04,229 --> 01:09:06,390
Jack, let me get back to you.

1008
01:09:09,267 --> 01:09:10,427
Thomas.

1009
01:09:14,673 --> 01:09:16,231
I'm sorry, my friend.

1010
01:09:16,274 --> 01:09:18,606
I couldn't stand by
and do nothing.

1011
01:09:32,991 --> 01:09:34,618
Hey! What's up, baby?

1012
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:38,661
Man, you got guts calling me.
I'm gonna hang up.

1013
01:09:38,697 --> 01:09:40,528
Hey, wait a minute.

1014
01:09:40,565 --> 01:09:42,396
Don't hang up.
Look, you know what?

1015
01:09:42,434 --> 01:09:45,267
You was right about me,
all right? I'm sorry.

1016
01:09:45,303 --> 01:09:47,396
- Are you on drugs?
- You was right.

1017
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:49,805
I was egotistic.
I was inconsiderate.

1018
01:09:49,841 --> 01:09:52,401
- I was self- centered.
- Yeah.

1019
01:09:52,444 --> 01:09:54,412
I ain't used to working
with partners...

1020
01:09:54,446 --> 01:09:56,573
but it ain't about me.
it's the little girl.

1021
01:09:56,615 --> 01:09:58,105
She gonna die without our help.

1022
01:09:58,149 --> 01:10:00,413
You understand what I'm saying?

1023
01:10:00,452 --> 01:10:02,181
Not yet, but keep talking.

1024
01:10:02,220 --> 01:10:05,587
I think something big going down
tonight, all right?

1025
01:10:05,624 --> 01:10:07,819
I need to know
where the consul's gonna be.

1026
01:10:07,859 --> 01:10:10,020
You think you can help me?

1027
01:10:10,061 --> 01:10:12,029
I'll see what I can do.

1028
01:10:12,063 --> 01:10:14,793
No. I don't need you to see.
I need you to do it.

1029
01:10:14,833 --> 01:10:16,630
Can you do it?

1030
01:10:18,036 --> 01:10:19,162
OK, Carter.

1031
01:10:19,204 --> 01:10:21,866
- All right, one other thing.
- Yeah?

1032
01:10:21,906 --> 01:10:23,897
What color panties you got on?

1033
01:10:32,150 --> 01:10:33,913
Consul Han, I want you to go...

1034
01:10:33,952 --> 01:10:35,920
to the Chinese expo
as you planned.

1035
01:10:35,954 --> 01:10:38,286
Have the money
in the upstairs control room.

1036
01:10:38,323 --> 01:10:40,291
Be sure to make no more mistake.

1037
01:10:40,325 --> 01:10:42,657
I understand, but I want
to speak with my daughter!

1038
01:11:03,515 --> 01:11:06,143
Excuse me, miss.
Who's the captain on this plane?

1039
01:11:06,184 --> 01:11:08,948
Look, it don't even matter.
You need to go up there...

1040
01:11:08,987 --> 01:11:11,717
tell the captain we got
a problem on the left side.

1041
01:11:11,756 --> 01:11:14,190
Something wrong with the engine.
You need a new alternator.

1042
01:11:14,225 --> 01:11:16,159
My supervisor said,
'Willy, go on down there...

1043
01:11:16,194 --> 01:11:17,855
"and fix that plane.
Put the alternator on.

1044
01:11:17,896 --> 01:11:19,659
"Don't let it leave
till I come down there."

1045
01:11:19,698 --> 01:11:21,632
I suggest you tell
the proper authorities...

1046
01:11:21,666 --> 01:11:24,362
not to move this plane
before the FAA comes here...

1047
01:11:24,402 --> 01:11:26,427
and we all in some shit. Go on!

1048
01:11:33,611 --> 01:11:35,476
What are you doing here?

1049
01:11:35,513 --> 01:11:37,947
Now get your ass up.
We got work to do.

1050
01:11:37,982 --> 01:11:40,075
Go away. I've disgraced myself.

1051
01:11:40,118 --> 01:11:41,847
Lee, what about the little girl?

1052
01:11:41,886 --> 01:11:44,946
Leave me alone. A man like you
could never understand.

1053
01:11:44,989 --> 01:11:47,890
- A man like me?
- Devoted only to yourself.

1054
01:11:47,926 --> 01:11:49,917
You're ashamed of being
a police officer.

1055
01:11:49,961 --> 01:11:51,485
You dishonor your father's name.

1056
01:11:51,529 --> 01:11:53,360
You don't know nothing
about my father.

1057
01:11:53,398 --> 01:11:55,025
You say your father is a legend.

1058
01:11:55,066 --> 01:11:57,000
My father was a legend.

1059
01:11:57,035 --> 01:11:59,265
He was killed making a routine
traffic stop in daylight...

1060
01:11:59,304 --> 01:12:01,204
by some punk
who didn't want no ticket...

1061
01:12:01,239 --> 01:12:03,503
when his partner supposed
to get out of the car...

1062
01:12:03,541 --> 01:12:04,940
and back him up, he didn't.

1063
01:12:04,976 --> 01:12:08,707
My father was as devoted as you,
and now he's dead.

1064
01:12:08,747 --> 01:12:11,716
And for what?
A traffic ticket and some punk?

1065
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:14,310
You tell me,
what's the honor in that?

1066
01:12:14,352 --> 01:12:16,320
You believe your father
wasted his life...

1067
01:12:16,354 --> 01:12:17,719
died for nothing?

1068
01:12:19,657 --> 01:12:21,124
Prove me wrong.

1069
01:12:24,095 --> 01:12:27,553
For 15 years until China
resumed control of Hong Kong...

1070
01:12:27,599 --> 01:12:31,467
Juntao was the most powerful
crime lord in Southeast Asia.

1071
01:12:31,503 --> 01:12:35,769
The British tried to close down
his operation, but we failed.

1072
01:12:35,807 --> 01:12:37,934
But why the consul's daughter?

1073
01:12:37,976 --> 01:12:40,638
Detective Inspector Lee
helped me raid...

1074
01:12:40,678 --> 01:12:43,511
every known asset
of Juntao's operation.

1075
01:12:43,548 --> 01:12:46,642
We confiscated millions
in weapons and cash...

1076
01:12:46,684 --> 01:12:51,053
and a collection of Chinese art
unsurpassed in the world.

1077
01:12:51,089 --> 01:12:54,820
Then Juntao disappeared.
No witnesses.

1078
01:12:54,859 --> 01:12:57,828
Do you really think
he'll kill the girl?

1079
01:13:01,132 --> 01:13:05,694
My advice to you is...
pay the money.

1080
01:13:21,019 --> 01:13:23,988
Consul, I'm going upstairs
to make the drop.

1081
01:13:24,022 --> 01:13:27,287
I want you to remain calm
as if nothing's wrong...

1082
01:13:27,325 --> 01:13:30,385
and don't leave Agent Whitney's
side even for a moment.

1083
01:13:30,428 --> 01:13:32,089
I understand.

1084
01:14:25,917 --> 01:14:28,249
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

1085
01:14:28,286 --> 01:14:30,254
I'm am Consul Han.

1086
01:14:30,288 --> 01:14:32,916
On behalf of the People's
Republic of China...

1087
01:14:32,957 --> 01:14:34,288
thank you for coming.

1088
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:40,757
I am pleased to present...

1089
01:14:40,798 --> 01:14:43,392
5,000 years of Chinese history
and heritage...

1090
01:14:43,434 --> 01:14:45,868
a collection which,
until recently...

1091
01:14:45,904 --> 01:14:47,872
was thought to be lost forever.

1092
01:14:47,906 --> 01:14:50,568
This some nice shit.

1093
01:14:50,608 --> 01:14:52,633
That Buddha'd go good
in my bathroom.

1094
01:14:52,677 --> 01:14:56,272
Hey. This is the history
of my country....

1095
01:14:56,314 --> 01:14:59,340
priceless pieces
of Chinese culture.

1096
01:14:59,384 --> 01:15:01,477
If anything gets damaged...

1097
01:15:01,519 --> 01:15:04,181
Ain't nothing gonna happen
to none of this stuff.

1098
01:15:04,222 --> 01:15:09,387
And now we can pass them on
to our children.

1099
01:15:18,069 --> 01:15:20,230
Pardon me.

1100
01:15:26,110 --> 01:15:28,203
I seen that guy
at that Chinese restaurant.

1101
01:15:28,246 --> 01:15:31,545
Consul Han has been fighting flu
for the past few days...

1102
01:15:31,583 --> 01:15:33,949
so perhaps I should finish
what he started.

1103
01:15:33,985 --> 01:15:37,216
The first thing we gotta do
is clear out this riffraff.

1104
01:15:37,255 --> 01:15:39,553
If anybody stay behind,
they got something to lose.

1105
01:15:39,591 --> 01:15:41,286
Wait right here.
I'll be right back.

1106
01:15:41,326 --> 01:15:44,557
...future between
our two countries.

1107
01:15:44,596 --> 01:15:46,188
The more we see
the differences...

1108
01:15:46,230 --> 01:15:47,356
Hey!

1109
01:15:47,398 --> 01:15:48,524
And similarities- - 

1110
01:15:48,566 --> 01:15:50,158
Excuse me,
ladies and gentlemen!

1111
01:15:50,201 --> 01:15:51,327
Goddamn it.

1112
01:15:51,369 --> 01:15:52,996
I'm Detective Carter
from the LAPD!

1113
01:15:53,037 --> 01:15:55,437
Russ, we got Carter down here.

1114
01:15:55,473 --> 01:15:57,270
What the hell's going on
down there?

1115
01:15:57,308 --> 01:15:59,674
We have just received
a threat on the building.

1116
01:15:59,711 --> 01:16:01,770
We ask that you please exit
the building...

1117
01:16:01,813 --> 01:16:05,510
as soon as possible,
and please do not panic.

1118
01:16:05,550 --> 01:16:08,747
Didn't you hear what I said?
Get your shit and go out!

1119
01:16:08,786 --> 01:16:10,549
Get the hell out!
There's a bomb in the building!

1120
01:16:10,588 --> 01:16:13,648
I don't believe this.
Agents, hold your positions!

1121
01:16:13,691 --> 01:16:15,556
Everybody take care,
but hold your positions.

1122
01:16:15,593 --> 01:16:16,719
What's going on?

1123
01:16:16,761 --> 01:16:18,285
Get your old ass
out the building!

1124
01:16:18,329 --> 01:16:20,126
Lady, put the glass down
and get out of here!

1125
01:16:20,164 --> 01:16:24,567
Woman, the exit over there.
Gonna get your head blowed off!

1126
01:16:24,602 --> 01:16:26,229
Come on, come on!

1127
01:16:26,270 --> 01:16:28,670
Titty, titty, titty.
Get them titties outta here.

1128
01:16:28,706 --> 01:16:29,900
Will somebody grab Carter?

1129
01:16:44,756 --> 01:16:48,248
Consul Han, six blocks of C- 4
are wired to your daughter...

1130
01:16:48,292 --> 01:16:49,782
in a car outside.

1131
01:16:54,532 --> 01:16:57,467
Before the changeover,
most of this exhibition...

1132
01:16:57,502 --> 01:17:00,630
was in the hands
of a single private collector...

1133
01:17:01,906 --> 01:17:03,168
Me.

1134
01:17:03,207 --> 01:17:07,109
I worked most of my life
to acquire and catalog...

1135
01:17:07,145 --> 01:17:09,909
these priceless pieces
that you see before you.

1136
01:17:11,549 --> 01:17:14,109
And then, in one fell swoop...

1137
01:17:14,152 --> 01:17:16,143
it was taken away from me.

1138
01:17:17,388 --> 01:17:20,915
But tonight,
I shall be paid in full.

1139
01:17:20,958 --> 01:17:24,018
Don't move!

1140
01:17:24,062 --> 01:17:26,496
She dies if I press this button.

1141
01:17:28,566 --> 01:17:30,761
Just be patient.

1142
01:17:30,802 --> 01:17:33,464
My transportation
will be here shortly.

1143
01:17:37,375 --> 01:17:38,706
Stay calm.

1144
01:17:50,021 --> 01:17:53,320
I was just gonna tell you
you was in a red zone.

1145
01:17:53,357 --> 01:17:54,517
There's cops all over- - 

1146
01:17:57,829 --> 01:18:00,389
You didn't know I could do that.
Put your hands up!

1147
01:18:00,431 --> 01:18:02,194
I ain't gonna kill you
this time.

1148
01:18:02,233 --> 01:18:03,962
I'm just gonna kick your ass!

1149
01:18:07,839 --> 01:18:10,831
You tell your friends about me.

1150
01:18:22,587 --> 01:18:25,078
Hey, how you doing?

1151
01:18:25,123 --> 01:18:26,590
We've been looking for you.

1152
01:18:26,624 --> 01:18:28,387
I'm Detective Carter
from the LAPD.

1153
01:18:28,426 --> 01:18:31,589
Everything is OK now.
I'll take you to your daddy.

1154
01:18:31,629 --> 01:18:33,927
And first thing I'm gonna do
is take this vest off you.

1155
01:18:33,965 --> 01:18:35,091
Don't touch it!

1156
01:18:35,133 --> 01:18:36,930
I think it'll be safer
if we take it off.

1157
01:18:36,968 --> 01:18:40,335
No. I heard them say
it will explode.

1158
01:18:40,371 --> 01:18:43,306
I think it'll be safer
if we leave it on, OK?

1159
01:18:43,341 --> 01:18:44,865
Don't- - don't move.

1160
01:18:44,909 --> 01:18:46,171
Where are you?

1161
01:18:51,649 --> 01:18:52,775
Don't move!

1162
01:18:52,817 --> 01:18:54,341
Hold your positions, goddamn it!

1163
01:18:54,385 --> 01:18:56,546
Do not draw your weapons.

1164
01:19:00,658 --> 01:19:02,523
Ladies and gentlemen...

1165
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:05,085
I think we'll call that
an evening.

1166
01:19:05,129 --> 01:19:07,654
Thank you and good night.

1167
01:19:33,858 --> 01:19:35,485
I got something for you!

1168
01:19:36,828 --> 01:19:38,728
Got something you want.

1169
01:19:43,167 --> 01:19:45,761
I got your bomb right here.

1170
01:19:51,108 --> 01:19:53,736
Want to blow something up?

1171
01:19:53,778 --> 01:19:55,075
Come on.

1172
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:58,475
Push the button. Come on.

1173
01:20:00,318 --> 01:20:01,444
Push the button.

1174
01:20:01,485 --> 01:20:04,386
- What are you doing?
- Play along.

1175
01:20:04,422 --> 01:20:06,083
Come on, push the button.

1176
01:20:06,123 --> 01:20:07,818
Yeah, come on, push the button.

1177
01:20:09,927 --> 01:20:11,053
Blow everybody up.

1178
01:20:11,095 --> 01:20:12,892
Yeah, blow everybody up!

1179
01:20:12,930 --> 01:20:14,830
Push the goddamn button!

1180
01:20:16,601 --> 01:20:18,296
You heard what she said.

1181
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:23,672
You got everybody excited about
something being blowed up...

1182
01:20:23,708 --> 01:20:25,175
and look at your
little punk British ass.

1183
01:20:25,209 --> 01:20:27,109
Come on! Push the button!

1184
01:20:29,046 --> 01:20:30,172
Deal with it, please.

1185
01:20:30,214 --> 01:20:31,704
Where you going?

1186
01:20:39,023 --> 01:20:40,183
Cover the consul!

1187
01:20:42,627 --> 01:20:44,822
it's OK. She's a professional.

1188
01:20:44,862 --> 01:20:46,659
You must take the vest off.

1189
01:20:46,697 --> 01:20:50,030
Just give me a second.

1190
01:20:52,236 --> 01:20:54,033
There's a trigger on this vest.

1191
01:20:54,071 --> 01:20:56,403
It'll blow if I take it off.

1192
01:21:02,546 --> 01:21:04,138
Haven't you done this before?

1193
01:21:04,181 --> 01:21:06,672
it's a little different
in the practice room.

1194
01:21:06,717 --> 01:21:07,979
Everybody take cover.

1195
01:21:08,019 --> 01:21:10,681
We need more men down here.

1196
01:21:10,721 --> 01:21:13,417
Say again. Dan, do you read- - 

1197
01:21:26,370 --> 01:21:28,395
Need some help down here,
damn it!

1198
01:21:34,679 --> 01:21:37,546
Roses are red...

1199
01:21:37,581 --> 01:21:40,106
violets are blue.

1200
01:21:41,352 --> 01:21:43,343
Sugar is sweet...

1201
01:21:45,690 --> 01:21:47,282
and so are you.

1202
01:21:55,499 --> 01:21:58,991
The remote can still set it off.

1203
01:21:59,036 --> 01:22:00,936
Get rid of it.

1204
01:22:06,310 --> 01:22:08,403
- She OK?
- Yes.

1205
01:22:10,214 --> 01:22:12,580
I know that ain't the bomb!

1206
01:22:13,617 --> 01:22:15,380
Get that bomb away from me!

1207
01:22:15,419 --> 01:22:18,582
Take the bomb outside!

1208
01:22:20,658 --> 01:22:23,024
Yeah, take it over to Juntao.

1209
01:22:23,060 --> 01:22:25,290
You go that way,
I go that way. Go!

1210
01:22:32,269 --> 01:22:33,736
Don't shoot!

1211
01:23:41,772 --> 01:23:43,000
Shit!

1212
01:24:00,157 --> 01:24:01,488
Where are you going?

1213
01:24:22,313 --> 01:24:24,144
Meet me on the roof.

1214
01:24:24,181 --> 01:24:26,809
Roger.

1215
01:24:48,405 --> 01:24:49,929
Don't move, man!

1216
01:24:49,974 --> 01:24:54,911
Yeah, I been looking for your
sweet- and- sour chicken ass.

1217
01:24:54,945 --> 01:24:58,278
Your boys ain't here now.
You all alone.

1218
01:24:58,315 --> 01:25:00,374
I kill him.

1219
01:25:00,417 --> 01:25:02,977
Go ahead. I don't even like him.

1220
01:25:07,391 --> 01:25:09,484
Put your gun down.

1221
01:25:09,527 --> 01:25:11,995
Fight like a man.

1222
01:25:12,029 --> 01:25:13,428
What you say?

1223
01:25:13,464 --> 01:25:14,954
Fight like a man.

1224
01:25:16,133 --> 01:25:17,498
Fight like a man?

1225
01:25:19,336 --> 01:25:21,463
All right,
I'm gonna kick your ass.

1226
01:25:21,505 --> 01:25:23,905
Then I'm gonna
take your ass to jail.

1227
01:25:23,941 --> 01:25:28,105
All right, come on,
put the gun down...

1228
01:25:28,145 --> 01:25:29,476
same time.

1229
01:25:53,337 --> 01:25:56,534
Wipe yourself off, man.
You're dead.

1230
01:27:08,078 --> 01:27:09,375
Thank you, God.

1231
01:27:35,339 --> 01:27:36,499
Oh, shit.

1232
01:27:58,696 --> 01:28:00,288
You know he dead.

1233
01:28:02,366 --> 01:28:04,926
Help! Do something!

1234
01:28:04,968 --> 01:28:07,630
Hey, be cool, man!

1235
01:28:07,671 --> 01:28:09,138
Hang on!

1236
01:28:13,477 --> 01:28:15,707
l can't hold on anymore!

1237
01:28:15,746 --> 01:28:18,715
Hang on for about an hour.
I'm gonna get the ambulance.

1238
01:28:18,749 --> 01:28:21,513
- What are you doing?
- I'll be right back.

1239
01:28:21,552 --> 01:28:23,952
- Carter!
- I was just playing.

1240
01:28:28,826 --> 01:28:30,316
Do something!

1241
01:28:34,064 --> 01:28:35,793
I can't hold on anymore!

1242
01:28:54,718 --> 01:28:55,946
Oh, shit!

1243
01:28:59,690 --> 01:29:01,624
Thank you! Thank you!

1244
01:29:03,127 --> 01:29:06,654
- What the hell you doing?
- I was just being polite.

1245
01:29:06,697 --> 01:29:09,325
Well, next time,
be polite to my nuts.

1246
01:29:09,366 --> 01:29:11,334
I'm sorry.

1247
01:29:11,368 --> 01:29:13,336
Thank you.

1248
01:29:13,370 --> 01:29:15,031
Shit!

1249
01:29:26,884 --> 01:29:28,351
Are you all right?

1250
01:29:28,385 --> 01:29:29,750
I'm fine.

1251
01:29:30,821 --> 01:29:34,655
- I owe you everything.
- Only your friendship.

1252
01:29:38,562 --> 01:29:41,463
Look who's here.

1253
01:29:41,498 --> 01:29:43,466
What took you so long?

1254
01:29:48,405 --> 01:29:50,896
I think this belongs to you.

1255
01:30:02,319 --> 01:30:04,082
I think you should come with me.

1256
01:30:04,121 --> 01:30:06,282
Get on the plane
when you get off work.

1257
01:30:06,323 --> 01:30:08,291
You fly for free.

1258
01:30:08,325 --> 01:30:09,883
I'm just trying
to expand my horizons.

1259
01:30:09,927 --> 01:30:13,055
Travel a little bit.
See the world.

1260
01:30:17,434 --> 01:30:21,302
I'm through with y'all, man.
I'm going on vacation.

1261
01:30:21,338 --> 01:30:24,398
Now, hold on there.
We were just coming by...

1262
01:30:24,441 --> 01:30:26,409
to tell you what a great job
you did yesterday.

1263
01:30:26,443 --> 01:30:28,434
And when you come back...

1264
01:30:28,479 --> 01:30:30,811
there's gonna be
an FBI badge waiting for you.

1265
01:30:32,082 --> 01:30:33,515
You serious?

1266
01:30:34,952 --> 01:30:37,216
- Come on, don't be playing.
- No.

1267
01:30:37,254 --> 01:30:40,280
I don't know what to say.
it's like a dream come true.

1268
01:30:41,492 --> 01:30:44,484
I got an idea, though.

1269
01:30:44,528 --> 01:30:48,726
Why don't y'all
take that badge...

1270
01:30:48,765 --> 01:30:50,699
and shove it up your ass?

1271
01:30:50,734 --> 01:30:54,170
All up in your ass. I'm LAPD.

1272
01:30:57,574 --> 01:30:58,905
Bitch.

1273
01:31:01,411 --> 01:31:04,380
First class. I like this.
This is tight.

1274
01:31:04,414 --> 01:31:05,813
Can I take your jacket, sir?

1275
01:31:05,849 --> 01:31:08,818
My jacket? No.
You can take this bag, though.

1276
01:31:08,852 --> 01:31:10,820
How you doing? What's up?

1277
01:31:10,854 --> 01:31:12,321
What's up, man?

1278
01:31:12,356 --> 01:31:13,823
- You ready to go?
- Yep.

1279
01:31:13,857 --> 01:31:15,347
May I offer you some peanuts?

1280
01:31:21,131 --> 01:31:23,429
You never told me
you spoke Chinese.

1281
01:31:23,467 --> 01:31:26,925
I never told you I didn't.
You assumed I didn't.

1282
01:31:26,970 --> 01:31:29,996
This is cool. Han's letting me
go to Hong Kong with you.

1283
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:32,270
I ain't been on no vacation
in five years?

1284
01:31:32,309 --> 01:31:35,403
We can hang in my crib.
I will show you my hood.

1285
01:31:35,445 --> 01:31:37,777
No, you can show me a couple
of them Chinese girls.

1286
01:31:37,814 --> 01:31:40,282
I want a massage.
I'm gonna get buck wild.

1287
01:31:40,317 --> 01:31:44,754
No police work for two weeks?
How long this flight?

1288
01:31:44,788 --> 01:31:47,450
- Fifteen hours.
- Fifteen hours?

1289
01:31:47,491 --> 01:31:49,823
What are we gonna do
for 15 hours?

1290
01:31:56,333 --> 01:31:57,459
War...

1291
01:31:57,501 --> 01:32:00,732
Oh, hell, no! Stewardess!

1292
01:32:00,771 --> 01:32:01,669
What is it good for?

1293
01:32:01,705 --> 01:32:02,899
Stewardess, get me another seat!

1294

Don't move! Don't smile!

1299
01:32:40,811 --> 01:32:43,678

01:32:43,714 --> 01:32:44,840

1302

Was that it, Chelsea- -

01:33:52,983 --> 01:33:55,975
Man, people tell me shit.

1323

My daddy one caught a bullet
by his bare hand.

No bullshit.

1329
01:34:14,171 --> 01:34:16,139
What's the honor in that?

1330

You believe your father

You're right, man.
Let's go tell them.

1333
01:34:27,851 --> 01:34:29,148

01:34:42,299 --> 01:34:44,290
May I offer you some peanuts?

1339

See, how difficult is that?
My English?

01:35:02,586 --> 01:35:05,714
He even cannot say three words,
Chinese.

01:35:05,756 --> 01:35:07,087
You need some lunch?

1342
