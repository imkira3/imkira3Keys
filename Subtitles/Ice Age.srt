00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:57,945
Why not call it
the Big Chill or the Nippy era?

3
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:01,240
I'm just sayin',
how do we know it's an ice age?

4
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:04,034
Because of all the ice.

5
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,914
Well, things just got a little chillier.

6
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:12,751
Help. Help.

7
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:16,255
Come on, kids, let's go.
The traffic's movin'.

8
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,507
But, but, but, Dad.

9
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,593
No buts. You can play extinction later.

10
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,680
OK. Come on, guys.

11
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:27,474
So, where's Eddie?

12
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:31,436
He said he was on the verge
of an evolutionary breakthrough.

13
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:32,938
Really?

14
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:36,858
I'm flying.

15
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,736
Some breakthrough.

16
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,699
- Look out.
- You're going the wrong way.

17
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,660
Crazy mammoth.

18
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:58,380
Do the world a favor.
Move your issues off the road.

19
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,135
If my trunk was that small,
I wouldn't draw attention to myself, pal.

20
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:06,596
Give me a break.
We've been waddlin' all day.

21
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:11,435
Go ahead. Follow the crowd.

22
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,021
It'll be quieter when you're gone.

23
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:18,275
Come on. If he wants to
freeze to death, let him.

24
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:30,078
I'm up. I'm up.

25
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:37,836
Rise and shine, everybody.
Huh? Zak? Marshall?

26
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,672
Bertie? Uncle Fungus?

27
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:47,429
Where is everybody? Come on, guys,
we're gonna miss the migration.

28
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:54,436
They left without me.
They do this every year.

29
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,274
Why? Doesn't anyone love me?

30
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:04,196
Isn't there anyone who cares
about Sid the Sloth?

31
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,992
All right, I'll just go by myself.

32
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,205
Sick.

33
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,083
Wide body, curb it next time.

34
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,585
Oh, jeez. Yuck.

35
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:24,674
I can't believe it. Fresh wild greens.
Frank, where did you ever...?

36
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,886
- Go ahead. Dig in.
- A dandelion.

37
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,598
- I thought the frost wiped 'em all out.
- All but one.

38
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:36,812
It makes me so... l wanna... Yuck.

39
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:41,691
This has definitely not been my day.
You know what I'm sayin', buddy?

40
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:45,570
What a mess. You rhinos
have tiny brains. Did you know that?

41
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:50,659
It's just a fact. No offense. You probably
didn't even know what I'm talkin' about.

42
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,786
Yummo.

43
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,039
A dandelion. Must be
the last one of the season.

44
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,294
- Carl.
- Easy, Frank.

45
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,505
He ruined our salad.

46
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:08,093
My mistake.
That was my mistake. Let me...

47
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:11,930
No, no, seriously, let me
take care of this. What is this?

48
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:15,725
Pine cones. Oh, my goodness.
They're my favorite.

49
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:22,315
Delicious. That's good eating.

50
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,861
But don't let me hog them all up.
Here, you have some.

51
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,738
Tasty, isn't it? Bon appétit.

52
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:31,616
Now?

53
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,035
Now.

54
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:47,632
- Just pretend that I'm not here.
- I wanted to hit him at full speed.

55
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:52,929
- That's OK. We'll have some fun with him.
- Don't let them impale me. I wanna live.

56
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:56,391
- Get off me.
- Come on, you're makin' a scene.

57
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,436
We'll just take our furry piñata and go.

58
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,439
If it's not them today,
it's someone else tomorrow.

59
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,983
Well, I'd rather it not be today. OK?

60
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:08,487
We'll break your neck
so you don't feel a thing.

61
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,656
Wait a minute. I thought
rhinos were vegetarians.

62
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,742
- An excellent point.
- Shut up.

63
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:17,496
Who says we're gonna eat him
after we kill him?

64
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,540
I don't like animals that kill for pleasure.

65
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:24,252
- Save it for a mammal that cares.
- I'm a mammal that cares.

66
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:29,466
OK, if either of you make it across that
sinkhole in front of ya, you get the sloth.

67
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:33,386
That's right, you losers.
You take one step and you're dead.

68
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:41,269
- You were bluffing, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah, that was a bluff.

69
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,980
Get him.

70
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,310
A dandelion?

71
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,315
We did it.

72
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,452
- You have beautiful eyes.
- Get off my face.

73
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:44,749
Whoa, we make a great team.
What do you say we head south together?

74
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,294
Great. Jump on my back
and relax the whole way.

75
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,379
- Wow, really?
- No.

76
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:54,050
Wait, aren't you going south? The change
of seasons, migration instincts.

77
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,761
- Any of this a-ringin' a bell?
- I guess not. Bye.

78
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:00,390
OK, then. Thanks for the help.
I can take it from here.

79
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:04,644
You overgrown weasel.
Wait till we get down there.

80
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:09,149
That south thing is way overrated.
The heat, the crowds - who needs it?

81
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:13,778
Isn't this great? You and me,
two bachelors knockin' about in the wild.

82
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:17,657
No, you just want a bodyguard so you
don't become somebody's side dish.

83
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,118
You're a very shrewd mammal.

84
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:23,288
OK, lead the way, Mr. Big...
Didn't get the name.

85
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:25,206
- Manfred.
- Manfred? Yuck.

86
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:30,837
How about Manny the Moody Mammoth?
Or Manny the Melancholy... Manny the...

87
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,216
Stop following me.

88
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:42,557
OK, so you've got issues. You won't
even know I'm here. I'll just zip the lip.

89
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:30,772
Look at the cute little baby, Diego.

90
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:36,194
Isn't it nice he'll be joining us
for breakfast?

91
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:38,571
It wouldn't be breakfast without him.

92
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:44,536
Especially since his daddy wiped out half
our pack and wears our skin to keep warm.

93
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,622
An eye for an eye, don't you think?

94
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:51,376
Let's show him what happens
when he messes with sabers.

95
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,671
Alert the troops. We attack at dawn.

96
00:11:55,589 --> 00:12:00,385
And, Diego, bring me that baby alive.

97
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:05,598
If I'm gonna enjoy my revenge,
I want it to be fresh.

98
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,955
Phew. I'm wiped out.

99
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,251
- That's your shelter?
- You're a big guy. You got a lotta wood.

100
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,962
- I'm a little guy.
- You got half a stick.

101
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:42,218
But with my little stick and my highly
evolved brain, I shall create fire.

102
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,679
Fascinating.

103
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:49,142
We'll see if brains triumph
over brawn tonight. Now, won't we?

104
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,525
Think I saw a spark.

105
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:04,908
Any chance I could squeeze
in there with you, Manny, ol' pal?

106
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:07,619
Isn't there someone else you can annoy?

107
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:11,456
Friends? Family? Poisonous reptiles?

108
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:16,252
My family abandoned me.
They just kinda migrated without me.

109
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,880
You should see what they did last year.

110
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,883
They woke up early and
tied my hands and feet

111
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,761
and they gagged me with a field mouse,

112
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:28,431
covered their tracks, went
through water so I'd lose their scent,

113
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,267
and... who needs 'em, anyway?

114
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:38,483
So what about you? You have family?

115
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,949
OK, you're tired. I see.
We'll talk more in the morning.

116
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,704
Manfred? Manfred?
Could you scooch over a drop?

117
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:55,875
Come on. Nobody falls asleep that fast.

118
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,086
Manny.

119
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,967
There's Diego. Fall back.

120
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,393
- Where's the baby?
- I lost it over the falls.

121
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,395
You lost it?

122
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:08,568
- I want that baby, Diego.
- I'll get it.

123
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:12,530
You'd better, unless you want to
serve as a replacement.

124
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:15,908
We'll go up to Half Peak. Meet us there.

125
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,245
It had better be alive.

126
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,082
Can we trust you with that, Diego?

127
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,959
Let's go.

128
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:52,403
She picked a hair off my shoulder and
says, "if you have an extra mating dance,

129
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,073
at least pick a female
with the same color pelt."

130
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:58,409
I thought "Whoa. She's gonna go
praying mantis on me."

131
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:02,497
if you find a mate, you should be loyal.
In your case, grateful.

132
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,666
- Now get away from me.
- I think mating for life is stupid.

133
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,336
There's plenty of Sid to go around.

134
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:14,509
Manny?

135
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:10,064
Look at that. He's OK.

136
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,452
She's gone.

137
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:37,592
- Manny, are you forgetting something?
- No.

138
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,385
But you just saved him.

139
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:42,221
I'm trying to get rid of
the last thing I saved.

140
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,849
But you can't leave him here.

141
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:52,440
Look, there's smoke.
That's his herd right up the hill.

142
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:56,694
- We should return him.
- Let's get this straight. There is no "we."

143
00:19:56,778 --> 00:20:02,408
There never was a "we." In fact, without
me, there wouldn't even be a "you."

144
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:09,957
- Just up the hill.
- Listen very carefully: I'm not going.

145
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:15,296
- Fine, be a jerk. I'll take care of him.
- Yeah, that's good.

146
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:18,883
You can't even take care of yourself.
This, I gotta see.

147
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:23,054
I'll return you. We don't need
that meany-weeny mammoth, do we?

148
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,306
No, we don't.

149
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:58,130
You're an embarrassment to nature.
Do you know that?

150
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:01,759
This is cake. I'm fine, I'm fine.

151
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,636
I'm gonna die.

152
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,110
Manny.

153
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,333
That pink thing is mine.

154
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,919
No. Actually, that pink thing belongs to us.

155
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,301
"Us"? You two are a bit of an odd couple.

156
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,136
There is no "us."

157
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,556
I see. Can't have one of your own,
so you want to adopt.

158
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,934
Look, I'm sorry to interrupt
your snack, but we gotta go.

159
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:55,354
The baby? Please.
I was returning him to his herd.

160
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,732
Oh, yeah. Nice try, bucktooth.

161
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,734
- Callin' me a liar?
- I didn't say that.

162
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,944
You were thinkin' it.

163
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:05,281
I don't like this cat. He reads minds.

164
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:09,118
- Name's Diego, friend.
- Manfred, and I'm not your friend.

165
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:11,537
Fine, Manfred.

166
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:16,292
If you're lookin' for the humans,
you're wastin' your time. They left.

167
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:19,545
Thanks for the advice. Now beat it.

168
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:23,632
I'll help you bring it to its herd,
but leave me alone after that.

169
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:27,178
- OK. OK, deal. What's your problem?
- You are my problem.

170
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:29,513
I think you're stressed,
so you eat too much.

171
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,724
It's hard to get fat on a vegan diet.

172
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:35,936
I'm not fat. It's all this fur.
It makes me look poofy.

173
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:39,774
All right, you have fat hair.
But when you're ready to talk, I'm here.

174
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,405
What are you doin'?
Just drop it on the ledge.

175
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,700
- We should make sure they found him.
- Good idea.

176
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,286
No, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

177
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,455
Don't spear me.

178
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,336
- This is a problem.
- Now what?

179
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,964
That's perfect.

180
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:37,081
- I told you they were gone.
- Look who it is.

181
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:39,750
Don't you have some
poor animal to disembowel?

182
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:43,629
They couldn't be far. I mean,
they went this way, or this way?

183
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:46,215
You don't know much
about tracking, do you?

184
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:50,177
I'm a sloth. I see a tree,
eat a leaf. That's my tracking.

185
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,513
You didn't miss them by much.

186
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:59,687
It's still green.
They headed north two hours ago.

187
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,443
You don't need this aggravation.

188
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:10,281
Give me the baby. I can
track humans down a lot faster than you.

189
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:13,075
And you're just a good citizen helpin' out?

190
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,745
- I just know where the humans are going.
- Glacier Pass.

191
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:20,416
Everybody knows they have
a settlement on the other side.

192
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:26,380
Unless you know how to track, you'll never
reach them before snow closes the pass.

193
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:29,467
Which should be, like, tomorrow.

194
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:35,389
So, you can give that baby to me,
or go get lost in a blizzard. It's your choice.

195
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:46,442
Here's your little bundle of joy.
We're returning it to the humans.

196
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:51,989
The big, bad tigey-wigey gets left behind.
Poor tigey-wigey.

197
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:55,159
Sid, tigey-wigey is gonna lead the way.

198
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:01,207
Manny, can I talk to you for a second?

199
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:06,128
No. The sooner we find the humans, the
sooner I get rid of Mr. Stinky Drool-Face,

200
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:08,756
and the baby, too.

201
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:12,510
You won't always have
Jumbo around to protect you.

202
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:18,057
And when that day comes, I suggest you
watch your back, cos I'll be chewin' on it.

203
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:22,019
Über-tracker.
Up front, where I can see you.

204
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,437
Help me.

205
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:43,207
You gotta make it stop.
I can't take it anymore.

206
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:47,419
- I've eaten things that complained less.
- He won't stop squirming.

207
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:49,505
- Watch its head.
- Put it down.

208
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:52,550
Jeez, "pick him up, put him down..."

209
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:55,886
- lts nose is dry.
- That means something's wrong with it.

210
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,806
- Someone should lick it. Just in case.
- I'll do it.

211
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,517
- He's wearing one of those baby thingies.
- So?

212
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:04,395
So if he poops, where does it go?

213
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:10,568
- Humans are disgusting.
- OK, you. Check for poop.

214
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:13,696
- Why am I the poop-checker?
- Returning him was your idea,

215
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:17,700
you're small and insignificant,
and I'll pummel you if you don't.

216
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:20,327
- Why else?
- Now, Sid.

217
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,837
I mean, my goodness.
Look out. Coming through.

218
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,715
- Watch out.
- Stop wavin' that thing around.

219
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,675
I'm gonna slip.

220
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:41,557
It's clean. Got ya!

221
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:45,728
Will you cut it out?

222
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:50,316
Do that again. He likes it.

223
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:54,903
It's makin' me feel better too.

224
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,906
Here, you hold it.

225
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,540
Turn him towards me.

226
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,917
Where is the baby?

227
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,337
There he is.

228
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:15,049
Where is the baby?

229
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:18,344
There he is.

230
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,347
Stop it. You're scarin' him.

231
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,895
- I bet he's hungry.
- How about some milk?

232
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,898
- I'd love some.
- Not you. The baby.

233
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,734
I ain't exactly lactating right now, pal.

234
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:36,779
- You're a little low on the food chain to...
- Enough.

235
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:39,907
Enough, enough, enough.

236
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,370
Food.

237
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:57,049
<i>♪ I don't know, but I've been told ♪</i>

238
00:27:57,133 --> 00:28:01,512
<i>♪ End of the world be mighty cold ♪</i>

239
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:04,139
Prepare for the ice age!

240
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,684
Protect the dodo way of life!

241
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:11,063
Survival separates the dodos
from the beasts!

242
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:14,733
Protect the dodo way of life!

243
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:17,111
Prepare for the ice age!

244
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:20,197
- Ice age?
- I've heard of these crackpots.

245
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,703
- Intruders.
- Now, don't fall in.

246
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:29,790
- If you do, you will definitely...
- lntruders. Intruder...

247
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:33,460
...burn and die.

248
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:37,715
Can we have our melon back?
Junior's hungry and...

249
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:41,218
No way. This is our private
stockpile for the ice age.

250
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:45,431
Subarctic temperatures will force us
underground for a billion years.

251
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,641
So you got three melons?

252
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:53,147
If you weren't smart enough
to plan ahead, then doom on you.

253
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:56,859
Doom on you. Doom on you. Doom on you.

254
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:59,737
- Get away from me.
- Doom on you.

255
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,780
Oh, no. No.

256
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:06,076
Retrieve the melon.
Tae kwon dodos, attack.

257
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:21,467
- The melon.
- The melon, the melon, the melon...

258
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,512
There goes our last female.

259
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:35,814
- Got it, got it, got it.
- Don't got it.

260
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:40,027
The last melon.

261
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:09,825
Sid. Now we gotta find more food.

262
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:17,332
Right, more to the right. Right, right, right.

263
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:21,086
- Look at that. Dinner and a show.
- Left, left, left.

264
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:30,846
Now to find a meal
befitting a conquering hero.

265
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:37,102
What ho? A foe? Come on,
come on. You want a piece of me?

266
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,150
Spoils worthy of such a noble...

267
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,660
Bedtime, squirt.

268
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:05,297
The triumphant return.

269
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:08,258
Huh? Oh, that.

270
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:14,473
I'm so full. How about a good-night
kiss for your big buddy, Sid?

271
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:17,643
- He's asleep.
- I was talking to you.

272
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:20,604
Fine, I'll tuck myself in.

273
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:29,780
All right, good night.

274
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,013
Will you stop it?

275
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:58,100
All right, all right. I was trying to relax.

276
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:05,691
Oy.

277
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,657
- What the...?
- Slice me.

278
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,075
It'll be the last thing you ever do.

279
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,912
- I'm workin' here, you waste of fur.
- Frustrated, Diego?

280
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,957
Tracking down helpless infants
too difficult for you?

281
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:08,211
- What are you two doin' here?
- Soto's getting tired of waiting.

282
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:13,467
Yeah, he said "Come back with the baby,
or don't come back at all."

283
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,471
I have a message for Soto.

284
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:20,015
Tell him I'm bringing the baby.

285
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,518
And tell him I'm bringing...

286
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,979
a mammoth.

287
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:29,232
- A mammoth?
- Mammoths never travel alone.

288
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,944
This one does,
and I'm leading him to Half Peak.

289
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,990
Look at all that meat. Let's get him.

290
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:41,244
Not yet. We'll need the whole pack
to bring this mammoth down.

291
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,413
Get everyone ready.

292
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,916
Now.

293
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:12,526
- Where's the baby?
- You lost it?

294
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,195
Sid.

295
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:19,783
It's so ugly. Positively adorable.

296
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:23,745
Hello, pumpkin. Hello, little baldy bean.

297
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:28,041
- Where'd you find it?
- The poor kid, all alone in the wild.

298
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,377
Sabers were closing in on him.

299
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:33,505
- So I just snatched him.
- So brave.

300
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:38,135
Yeah, well, he needed me,
and I only wish I had one of my own, too.

301
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:42,639
Really? I find that attractive in a male.

302
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:46,059
Alas. Who wouldn't want
a family, I always say.

303
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:50,438
- Where've you been hiding?
- Yeah, well, you know...

304
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:57,863
Cute kid, huh? So, as I was saying, ladies...

305
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,492
Hey. Hi, Manny.

306
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,245
What's the matter with you?

307
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:10,250
Excuse me, ladies. You just keep
marinating and I'll be right back.

308
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,379
Sexy.

309
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:18,508
He's not much to look at,
but it's so hard to find a family guy.

310
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,970
Tell me about it.
All the sensitive ones get eaten.

311
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:26,266
No, no, no. Manny, please,
I'm begging you. I need him.

312
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:29,936
- A good-lookin' guy like you?
- You say that, but you don't mean it.

313
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:34,482
No, seriously. Look at you.
Those ladies, they don't stand a chance.

314
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,903
- You have a cruel sense of humor.
- Don't let me cramp your style.

315
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:41,156
- Thanks, Manny. You're a pal.
- Without Pinky.

316
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,533
Manny, I need him.

317
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:50,123
So, ladies, where were we?

318
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:53,084
- Carl.
- Easy, Frank.

319
00:36:55,963 --> 00:37:00,342
Pretty tail walks by, suddenly he moves
like a cheetah. And that tiger...

320
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:04,054
Yeah, Mr. Great Tracker.
Can't even find a sloth.

321
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:08,308
What am I? The wet nurse?
What are you lookin' at, bone bag?

322
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:13,939
Look at you. You're gonna
grow into a great predator.

323
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:18,902
I don't think so. What have you got?
You got a little patch of fur.

324
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:21,529
No fangs, no claws.

325
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:25,075
You're folds of skin wrapped in mush.

326
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,827
What's so threatening about you?

327
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:35,835
Does this look like
a petting zoo to you? Huh?

328
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:42,592
OK. All right, wise guy.
You just earned a time-out.

329
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:48,515
You think that's funny? How about this?

330
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,395
You'll be a little snack for the owls.

331
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:58,358
You're a brave little squirt,
I'll give you that.

332
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:09,202
Thank goodness. Thank goodness.
No. A tiger.

333
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,663
Help. Help.

334
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:14,124
- Where's the baby?
- Manfred has him.

335
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:18,503
Just put me in your mouth.
Come on. Hurry up. He got me.

336
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,380
Help.

337
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:23,174
- Get away from me.
- Lt went this way.

338
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,135
Over here.

339
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,313
Carl. The tiger beat us to him.

340
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:40,025
Wait a minute.

341
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:47,907
He's dead all right.

342
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,243
Carnivores have all the fun.

343
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:56,875
Gosh, I hate breaking their hearts
like that. But you know how it is.

344
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:01,004
All right, thanks.
You can put me down now.

345
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,590
Manny. Manny.

346
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:07,844
Guys, I thought we were in a hurry.
And Diego, spit that out.

347
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:11,056
You don't know where it's been.

348
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:14,893
Boy. For a second there,
I thought you were gonna eat me.

349
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:18,188
- I don't eat junk food.
- Thought you were gonna...

350
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,940
I thought you were gonna... Were you?

351
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:28,365
Come on, wait up. Wait up. Come on,
come on. Can you wait a second, please?

352
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:29,824
Fellas.

353
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,870
Thanks for waiting.

354
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:36,706
Three, two, one...

355
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,336
Sure is faithful.

356
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:58,645
- Don't make me reach back.
- He started it.

357
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:01,773
I don't care who started it. I'll finish it.

358
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,642
Modern architecture. It'll never last.

359
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,200
Hiya, Manny.

360
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:58,288
Hi, Diego.

361
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:07,255
Hey, Sid.

362
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:11,468
- You're lost.
- No. I know exactly where we are.

363
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,803
Ask him directions.

364
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:16,764
- I don't need directions.
- Fine, I'll ask him.

365
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,684
Buddy. You see any humans go by here?

366
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:25,982
I love this game. I love this game. OK, OK.

367
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:30,612
Three words. First word.
Stomp. No, no. Stamp, stamp.

368
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,906
Let me try. Pack.

369
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:37,160
Good one, Manny.
Pack of long teeth and claws.

370
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,622
Pack of wolves? Pack of...

371
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:43,500
Pack of bears? Pack of fleas?

372
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:46,002
Pack of whiskers? Pack of noses?

373
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:48,338
- Pachyderm?
- Pack of lies.

374
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:51,508
Pack of troubles. Pack a wallop.
Pack of birds.

375
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,259
Pack of flying fish.

376
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,186
Great news. I found a shortcut.

377
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:52,235
- What do you mean, shortcut?
- I mean faster than the long way around.

378
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:54,737
I know what a shortcut is.

379
00:42:54,822 --> 00:43:00,201
Either we beat the humans to Glacier Pass
or we take the long way and miss 'em.

380
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:03,663
Through there? What do you take me for?

381
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:07,166
This time tomorrow,
you could be a free mammoth.

382
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:10,420
Or a nanny. I never get tired of peekaboo.

383
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:13,047
Guys. Guys. Check this out.

384
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,261
Sid, the tiger found a shortcut.

385
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,682
No, thanks. I choose life.

386
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:25,435
Then I suggest you take the shortcut.

387
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:28,521
- Are you threatening me?
- Move, sloth!

388
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,070
Way to go, tiger.

389
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,573
Quick. Get inside.

390
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:04,766
OK, I vote shortcut.

391
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:22,950
Guys, stick together.
It's easy to get lost in here.

392
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:40,593
Guys?

393
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:59,696
A fish.

394
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:46,576
Will you keep up, please?
Hard enough to keep track of one baby.

395
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,873
I gotcha.

396
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:52,600
Captain, iceberg ahead.

397
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:00,650
Oh, no.

398
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:55,162
Yeah. Who's up for round two?

399
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:01,961
Tell the kid to be more careful.

400
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,588
Look, look. Tigers.

401
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:52,637
No, it's OK, it's OK. Look, the tigers
are just playing tag with the antelope.

402
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:59,185
- With their teeth.
- Come on, Sid, let's play tag.

403
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:00,895
You're it.

404
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:05,733
Sure. OK, OK, OK, where are the sloths?

405
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:08,778
You never see any sloths.
Have you ever noticed?

406
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:12,406
- Look, Manny, a mammoth.
- Somebody pinch me.

407
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:15,618
Hey, hey, this fat one looks just like you.

408
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:18,788
And he's got a family.

409
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:22,291
And he's happy.
Look, he's playing with his kid.

410
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:26,128
See? That's your problem. That's what
mammoths are supposed to do.

411
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,755
- Sid...
- Find a she-mmoth,

412
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:28,923
have baby mammoths...

413
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:30,549
- Sid.
- What?

414
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,635
- Shut up.
- But...

415
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:02,678
Would you look at that.

416
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:05,848
The tiger actually did it. There's Half Peak.

417
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:08,517
Next stop, Glacier Pass.

418
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:12,688
- How could I ever have doubted you?
- Did you hear that, little fella?

419
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:14,899
You're almost home.

420
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:22,114
- My feet are sweating.
- Do we need a news flash

421
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:25,618
- every time your body does something?
- Ignore him.

422
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:28,913
Seriously. My feet are really hot.

423
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:36,921
Tell me that was your stomach.

424
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:39,423
I'm sure it was just thunder.

425
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:42,426
From underground?

426
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:04,823
Come on, keep up with me.

427
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:07,284
I would if you were moving.

428
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:13,415
- I wish I could jump like that.
- Wish granted.

429
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:21,799
- Come on, move faster.
- Have you noticed the river of lava?

430
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:42,861
Hold Pinky.

431
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:16,603
Manny.

432
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:30,200
Manny, Manny, Manny, you OK?

433
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:33,287
Come on, come on, say something.
Anything.

434
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:37,750
What? What? I can't hear you.

435
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:40,085
You're standing on my trunk.

436
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:45,591
- You're OK. You're OK.
- Why did you do that?

437
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:48,761
You could have died, trying to save me.

438
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:51,430
That's what you do in a herd.

439
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:53,766
You look out for each other.

440
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,185
Well, thanks.

441
00:55:58,229 --> 00:56:02,816
I don't know about you guys, but we
are the weirdest herd I've ever seen.

442
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:24,296
I can't wait to get
my claws in that mammoth.

443
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:28,175
No one touches the mammoth
until I get that baby.

444
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:34,181
First, I'll slice its hindquarters
into sections.

445
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:38,477
- I'll put the white meat in one pile and...
- Knock it off. I'm starving.

446
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:42,272
Next, the shoulders. Occasionally
tough, but extremely juicy.

447
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:45,567
- I told you to knock it off.
- Save your energy.

448
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:48,320
Mammoths don't go down easy.

449
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:51,365
There's only one way to do it.

450
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:54,576
First, you have to force it into a corner.

451
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:58,705
Cut off its retreat.
And when you three have it trapped,

452
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:00,916
I'll go for the throat.

453
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:13,887
Guys, we gotta get this kid outta the wind.

454
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:20,269
- How much further?
- Three miles.

455
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:23,772
I'm beat. We'll get there in the morning.

456
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:30,487
- What are you doin'?
- I'm putting sloths on the map.

457
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:36,618
Why don't you make it realistic
and draw him lying down?

458
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:38,787
And make him rounder.

459
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:45,043
- Perfect.
- I forgot how to laugh.

460
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:54,386
I'm a genius.

461
00:57:58,224 --> 00:58:03,145
From now on you'll have to
refer to me as Sid, Lord of the Flame.

462
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:06,690
Lord of the Flame, your tail's on fire.

463
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:18,785
Thank you. From now on,
I'm gonna call you Diego.

464
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:21,288
Lord of "Touch Me and You're Dead".

465
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:24,500
I'm just kiddin', you little knucklehead.

466
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:27,127
Lovebirds.

467
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:29,254
Look at this.

468
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:35,260
I don't believe it.

469
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:53,820
Come here, you little biped.
Come here, you little wormy-worm.

470
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:56,031
Come to Uncle Sid.

471
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:59,159
No, no, no, no, no, no. This way. This way.

472
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,913
No, no, no. No, go to him.

473
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:06,208
Go to him.

474
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:09,920
OK.

475
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:14,883
Good job. Keep practicin'.

476
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:21,139
Look at that. Our little guy is growing up.

477
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:26,645
All right, come on. Sleep time, lumpy.

478
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:34,194
Look at that big pushover.

479
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:40,450
You know, Diego, I've never had
a friend who would risk his life for me.

480
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:44,621
Yeah, Manny's... he's a good guy.

481
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:47,249
Yeah, he is.

482
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:50,586
Well, good night.

483
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:28,123
Let's get you all cleaned up. What's your
daddy gonna say if you go back all stinky?

484
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,961
Let me just clean that up.
That looks good. A little bit here.

485
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:36,965
- You clean up nice, little fella.
- I think he's starting to look like me.

486
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:39,176
Diego, what do you think?

487
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:43,138
- Maybe we shouldn't do this.
- Why not?

488
01:00:43,222 --> 01:00:47,225
If we save him, he'll be a hunter.
And who do you think he'll hunt?

489
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,645
Maybe because we save him,
he won't hunt us.

490
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:54,274
Yeah, and maybe he'll grow fur and
a long skinny neck and call you Mama.

491
01:00:54,942 --> 01:01:00,322
- What's your problem?
- Nothing. Let's go. I'm freezing my tail off.

492
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,885
Diego. You frozen back there?

493
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:28,183
- Get down.
- What?

494
01:01:28,267 --> 01:01:30,519
- Get down and follow me.
- What's goin' on?

495
01:01:30,603 --> 01:01:35,565
At the bottom of Half Peak,
there's an ambush waiting for you.

496
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:38,402
- What?
- What do you mean, "ambush"?

497
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:42,364
- You set us up.
- Lt was my job.

498
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:46,034
- I was to get the baby, but then...
- You brought us home for dinner.

499
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:48,870
- That's it. You're out of the herd.
- I'm sorry.

500
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:51,206
No, you're not. Not yet.

501
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:55,043
- Listen, I can help you.
- Stay close, Sid. We can fight our way out.

502
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:58,255
You can't. The pack's too strong.
You have to trust me.

503
01:01:58,339 --> 01:02:01,633
Trust you? Why in the world
would we trust you?

504
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:04,052
Because I'm your only chance.

505
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,484
Hello, ladies.

506
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:22,529
Look who decided to show up.

507
01:02:22,613 --> 01:02:25,907
Diego, I was beginning to worry about you.

508
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:32,289
No need to worry. In about two minutes
you'll be satisfying your taste for revenge.

509
01:02:32,373 --> 01:02:34,249
Very nice.

510
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:37,544
I see the sloth. And he's got the baby.

511
01:02:37,628 --> 01:02:40,422
Don't give away your positions
until you see the mammoth.

512
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:42,966
He's the one to surprise.

513
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:46,678
You want to maul something, don't you?

514
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:50,265
- I wanna maul.
- Then what are you waiting for?

515
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:56,188
No, I said wait for the mammoth.

516
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:21,046
Backscratcher. Eat my powder!

517
01:03:36,854 --> 01:03:38,730
Loop-de-loop.

518
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:41,942
Slalom! Slalom, baby!

519
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:11,513
Sorry, fellas. He got a little frostbite.

520
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:14,766
Get him.

521
01:04:18,145 --> 01:04:20,272
Surprise!

522
01:04:25,069 --> 01:04:29,865
OK, follow me. We'll pick up Sid
and get outta here while we can.

523
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:33,910
Come on, Diego,
let's bring this mammoth down.

524
01:04:46,173 --> 01:04:47,674
There he is.

525
01:04:50,595 --> 01:04:53,013
That's right. Where's the baby?

526
01:04:56,893 --> 01:05:00,145
Survival of the fittest.

527
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:03,064
I don't think so. Yeah.

528
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:18,747
- What are you doing?
- Leave the mammoth alone.

529
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:24,711
Fine. I'll take you down first.

530
01:06:40,746 --> 01:06:42,872
We did it.

531
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:58,346
We were some team, huh?

532
01:06:59,098 --> 01:07:02,475
Were? Come on, we're still a team.

533
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:05,478
I'm sorry I set you up.

534
01:07:05,938 --> 01:07:08,898
You know me -
I'm too lazy to hold a grudge.

535
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:14,237
Knock it off, squirt.

536
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:17,323
You gotta be strong.

537
01:07:17,658 --> 01:07:20,994
You have to take care of Manfred and Sid.

538
01:07:21,954 --> 01:07:23,913
Especially Sid.

539
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:27,917
Come on, you can lick this. You're a tiger.

540
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:31,046
Look, I'll carry you.
Come on, what do you say?

541
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:33,590
Come on, Diego, come on.

542
01:07:33,674 --> 01:07:36,301
Tell him he's going to be OK, Manny.

543
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:41,097
Listen, you have to leave me here.

544
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:45,143
If those humans get through the pass,
you'll never catch them.

545
01:07:45,978 --> 01:07:48,188
You didn't have to do that.

546
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:51,983
That's what you do in a herd.

547
01:11:07,638 --> 01:11:09,764
Don't forget about us.

548
01:11:09,848 --> 01:11:11,933
OK?

549
01:11:14,019 --> 01:11:16,479
We won't forget about you.

550
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:59,063
Goodbye.

551
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:01,607
Goodbye. Goodbye.

552
01:12:01,692 --> 01:12:04,068
- Sid...
- Bye.

553
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:07,405
Bye.

554
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:12,827
That's right. Where's the baby?

555
01:12:12,911 --> 01:12:15,413
Come on, Sid, let's head south.

556
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:35,391
Bye.

557
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:40,021
Save your breath, Sid.
You know humans can't talk.

558
01:12:40,481 --> 01:12:42,690
Diego? You're OK.

559
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:45,943
- Nine lives, baby.
- You're OK.

560
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:47,779
You're OK.

561
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:50,907
I could kiss ya.

562
01:12:52,618 --> 01:12:54,827
Welcome back, partner. Wanna lift?

563
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:57,914
No thanks. I gotta save
whatever dignity I've got left.

564
01:12:57,998 --> 01:13:02,543
You're hanging out with us. Dignity's
got nothing to do with it. I'll take that lift.

565
01:13:02,628 --> 01:13:05,129
- Yeah, climb aboard.
- Pick me up, buddy.

566
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:09,217
Mush. Or not mush. Either way.

567
01:13:12,805 --> 01:13:15,431
This is gonna be the best migration ever.

568
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:18,059
I'll show you my favorite watering holes.

569
01:13:18,143 --> 01:13:20,436
I turn brown when the fungus
in my fur dries.

570
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:24,273
- Attractive.
- This whole ice age thing is getting old.

571
01:13:24,358 --> 01:13:27,819
You know what I could go for?
Global warming.

572
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:30,988
- Keep dreamin'.
- No, really...
