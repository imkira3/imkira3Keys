1
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,800
Well done, boys.
Looks like ice-cold sushi for breakfast.

2
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,900
No, no, son. Over here.

3
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,300
See the lion?
Look at the lion and get the lion.

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,800
Now, son, if you're gonna grow up

5
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,200
and be like your daddy someday,
you gotta learn how to fight.

6
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,900
Da-da.

7
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,600
Now, Alakay, let me
show you something, OK?

8
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,000
You see this mark?

9
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,600
You and me are the same.

10
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,100
When you're bigger,
you'll be Alpha Lion, just like me.

11
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,000
Now let me see you fight. Ready?

12
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,700
No, Alakay. No dancing!

13
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,700
You just amuse yourself, don't you?

14
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:33,500
You're a strange kid.
You're a strange one. I'm...

15
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,800
Now, come on, let's try it again.

16
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,800
No, Alakay.

17
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,300
Stop that right now. Doggone it!

18
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,900
It's so disappointing when they
don't grow up the way you want.

19
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,300
Makunga. You're not
challenging me again, are you?

20
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,800
Look on the bright side. After I defeat
you and become alpha lion,

21
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,000
you'll have more time
to spend with your pathetic son.

22
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,400
Before I kick your butt, let me ask you:

23
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,000
Why do you want
to become the alpha lion?

24
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,400
I'm better looking, I have better hair,
I'm deceivingly smart...

25
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,800
...and I want everyone else
to do what I say.

26
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,100
We fight on three. One...

27
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,300
Pay attention, Alakay.
Daddy will show you how it's done.

28
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,000
Two, three!

29
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,900
- Who's the alpha lion?
- You are.

30
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,000
Don't you forget it.

31
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,100
And that, Alakay, is how you attack...

32
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,600
Alakay?

33
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,500
That's it. Here, kitty, kitty.

34
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,400
This one's a beauty.

35
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,700
He'll be worth a few bucks.

36
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,000
Itjust gets easier and easier.

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,300
Daddy!

38
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,300
Alakay! Alakay!

39
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,700
Alakay!

40
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,300
Da-da!

41
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,800
No! No! No!

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Alakay!

43
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,800
- Daddy!
- Daddy's got you! Hold on!

44
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,200
Da-da!

45
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,900
Alakay!

46
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,400
Daddy!

47
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,300
I've been around the world
in the pouring rain

48
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,800
Feeling out of place
and feeling strange

49
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,800
Take me to a place
where they know my name

50
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,200
'Cause I ain't met nobody
that looks the same

51
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,400
I'm a fish out of water
Lion out of the jungle

52
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,100
He's a fish out of water
Lion out of the jungle

53
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,300
I'm a fish out of water
Lion out of the jungle

54
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,400
He's a fish out of water
Lion out of the jungle

55
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,900
I need my peoples, my peoples
Take me to my peoples

56
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,700
Play thatjungle fever
Show 'em some love

57
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,800
Show love

58
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,300
Just gotta have someone
Gotta have someone

59
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,000
To relate to, to relate to

60
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,800
I'm feeling right at home

61
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,100
Feeling right at home
Feeling right at home

62
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,600
Feeling right at home
I'm feeling right at home

63
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,100
See I been traveling
Been traveling forever...

64
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,500
- I don't like the looks of this guy.
- He's kind of cute.

65
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,700
He's kind of a showoff.

66
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,100
You think he's cute?

67
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,500
Roar!!

68
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,200
The King of New York City...

69
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,300
...Alex the Lion!

70
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,600
I still think he's kind of a showoff.

71
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,700
The guy's an animal.

72
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,800
Maybe he should take a break.
You know, we could all use a vacation.

73
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,800
Come on, where would we go on vacation?

74
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,400
I don't know about you,
but I want to go to Connecticut!

75
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,700
On the loose, several animals, including
the world famous Alex the Lion,

76
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,900
escaped from
the Central Park Zoo tonight.

77
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,200
The escapees were cornered
in Grand Central Station.

78
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,400
He was a very bad kitty.

79
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,400
Animal rights activists,
who convinced zoo officials

80
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,700
to have the animals sent to Africa,

81
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,100
were stunned to learn
that the freighter carrying the animals

82
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,800
was reported missing today.

83
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,000
Tonight, hundreds of New Yorkers
have gathered at the zoo

84
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,600
to mourn the loss
of their beloved zoo animals.

85
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,700
The question on everyone's mind,
where are they now?

86
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,300
I like to move it, move it

87
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,200
He likes to move it, move it

88
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,200
She likes to move it, move it

89
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,000
- We like to
- Move it!

90
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,500
Come on! Y'all know this one!
It never gets stale!

91
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,300
- We like to
- Move it!

92
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,800
We'll miss you little fuzz buckets!
You've been a great crowd!

93
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,300
Glad we could introduce
you to the toilet.

94
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,400
If you ever come look us up in
Manhattan, feel free to call first.

95
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,100
Seriously though, call. OK?

96
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,200
Settle down, everybody. Be quiet!

97
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,300
You can't leave without this!

98
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,700
Surprise, freaks!

99
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,500
Shake it! Shake it.

100
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,400
Look, I'm a lady! I'm a lady, everyone!

101
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,800
I'm a lady! Not really!
It's me, King Julien!

102
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:19,000
Which of you is attracted to me?
Hands up!

103
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:27,100
Hey, freaks! You will be very glad
to hear that I am coming with you.

104
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,800
Oh, no, thank you.

105
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,200
Yes, thank you. It's my plane!

106
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:38,200
Until I return with the spoils
from the new country...

107
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,300
...Stevie will be in charge!

108
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,200
I don't think they like that idea.

109
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,500
What are you saying, Stevie?

110
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,400
No.

111
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:58,000
Could we...? No, you didn't say that!
How is that even possible?

112
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,900
Naughty little thing! Stevie says...

113
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Let them eat cake!

114
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
King Julien, wait for me!

115
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,300
I'm all packed! I have
a whole itinerary planned!

116
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,400
Oh, no! It's Mort! He's so annoying!

117
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,600
Don't let him on. Stop that thing!

118
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,700
He's carrying scissors and hand cream!

119
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,700
Everybody in! Quickly, get in, get in!
Get in quick!

120
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,200
- Struts.
- Check.

121
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
- Flaps.
- Check.

122
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,100
- Engine. Coffee maker.
- Check.

123
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,200
You guys!

124
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,700
Copsie-daisy!

125
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,700
That has to be the second biggest
slingshot I've ever seen.

126
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,200
But it'll have to do. Attention.

127
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,900
This is your captain speaking.

128
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,100
In the event of an emergency,
place the vest over your head

129
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,100
then kiss your... good-bye.

130
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,300
New York City, here we come!

131
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,100
Pray to your personal God
this hunk ofjunk flies.

132
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,300
Personal God, hunk...? What?

133
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,700
We are go, sir.

134
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,900
Open the door! I'm outside!

135
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,900
If cabin pressure is lost,

136
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,700
place the mask over your face
to hide your terrified expression.

137
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,900
Miss, aren't these supposed
to be attached to my seat?

138
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,400
- No, sir.
- OK, boys, launch!

139
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,100
Launch!

140
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,300
- Launch!
- Launch!

141
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,600
Gremlin!

142
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,500
Hey, Mort.

143
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,700
Hi!

144
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,900
That was weird.

145
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,200
- Somebody's dreaming.
- I think I saw Mort on the plane wing.

146
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,300
You got Madagascar on the brain.

147
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,900
I know I'm gonna miss it.

148
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,400
It was incredible. I think it'll seem
more fun the further we are from it.

149
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,100
Like when you bit me on the butt?

150
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,600
I'm gonna take that thing you're
holding onto and use it onstage.

151
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,400
It's all part of my little actor's salad
bar of emotional tidbits.

152
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,300
Are the butts next to the croutons?

153
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,600
You don't need to be sarcastic.

154
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:47,100
When we get back, I might sign up
for the breeding program.

155
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,200
Breeding program?

156
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,500
We reach a point when we
want to meet somebody.

157
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,000
Settle down, have a relationship.

158
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,200
I can see that.

159
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,500
What? Like dating?

160
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,100
Yeah, dating.

161
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,700
Other... other guys?

162
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,000
What do you mean, other guys?

163
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,900
Darn it!

164
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,000
What is holding up
that beverage service?!

165
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,200
I'm gonna go check.

166
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,700
You all keep talking.
I'm gonna catch a few winks.

167
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,700
It's so funny!

168
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,800
I like laughing!
It's such a nice experience!

169
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,100
To laugh!

170
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,900
Do you mind going back?
This is first class.

171
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,800
It's nothing personal. We're just better
than you. Maurice, I'm open! Hit me!

172
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,200
- He shoots, he scores!
- Is that Vivaldi?

173
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,000
- In-flight slave.
- Can I help you, Mr. Mankiewicz?

174
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,800
Bring my nuts on a silver platter.

175
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,000
We were checking on our drink order.

176
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,200
Sorry. Been a little backed up.

177
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,900
- I guess I'll go back...
- Where's your body?

178
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,500
You're freaking me out!
Can you please go over there, please?

179
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,700
What happened to
the separation of the classes?

180
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,600
I'm sure this democracy thing
is just a fad.

181
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,100
We'll go out for pineapple,
my bobbly-headed boobily-boo.

182
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,700
Skipper, look.

183
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,500
Analysis.

184
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,700
Looks like a small bulb used to indicate
something unusual, like a malfunction.

185
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,000
I find it pretty and somewhat hypnotic.

186
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
That too, sir.

187
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,400
Right! Rico?

188
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,700
Manual!

189
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,500
Problemo solved.

190
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,000
- We may be out of fuel.
- Why do you think so?

191
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,700
We've lost engine one...

192
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,500
...and engine two is no longer on fire.

193
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,300
Buckle up, boys.

194
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,900
Don't look, doll. This might get hairy.

195
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,500
Attention! This is your captain.

196
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,200
I have good and bad news. The good
news is, we're landing immediately.

197
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,500
The bad news is, we're crash-landing.

198
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,400
When it comes to air travel,
we know you have no choice.

199
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,500
But thanks for choosing Air Penguin.

200
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,300
Raise your arms, Maurice!
It's more fun when you raise your arms!

201
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,000
I can fly!

202
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:23,900
This could be it, Marty! I want you to
know you are a one-in-a-million friend!

203
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,100
Thanks, buddy! You're the best ever!

204
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,700
- And you won't mind when I tell you...
- Tell me anything!

205
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,600
I broke your iPod!

206
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,300
The buttons were so small!
It made me mad!

207
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,700
- The horror!
- I'm sorry!

208
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,600
- I'll kill you, butt-biter!
- It was an accident!

209
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,400
- An accident!
- Butt-biter!

210
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,500
I love you, Gloria! I always have!

211
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:56,700
Like you love the beach.
Or a good book. Or the beach.

212
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,400
Goodness, doll,
you're shaking like a leaf.

213
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,400
Rico, you've had your fun.

214
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,700
Pull up.

215
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,300
Gear down.

216
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,500
Gently. You just want
to kiss the ground.

217
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,400
Just a peck, a smooch,
like you'd kiss your sister.

218
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,500
I said, kiss it!

219
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,700
Now just a little brake. Just a touch.

220
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,400
I believe that's checkmate.

221
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,100
Commence emergency landing procedure.
Flaps up! Deploy!

222
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,100
Oh, we're here.

223
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,000
What in the world?

224
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,800
What happened to the plane?
What did y'all do to the plane?

225
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,300
I'm OK. I'm alive.

226
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:21,400
I can't even sleep for a minute.
This is not JFK.

227
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,500
Kowalski, casualty report.

228
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,500
Two passengers unaccounted for.

229
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,500
That's a number I can live with.
Good landing, boys.

230
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,200
Who says a penguin can't fly?

231
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,200
Hey, happy slappers! Is there some
reason to celebrate? Look at the plane!

232
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,900
- We'll fix it.
- How are you gonna fix this?

233
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,800
Grit, spit and a whole lot of duct tape.

234
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,900
We should be up and running
in, say, six to nine months.

235
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,900
- Sixty-nine months?!
- No, six to nine months.

236
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,700
Kowalski, I say we use
this setback to our advantage.

237
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:56,000
- Where'd you get that number?
- I want you to reconfigure the design.

238
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,800
How do you estimate that?

239
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,400
Pretty boy! Why don't
you and your friends dig a latrine.

240
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,700
Hold on. Who made you king
of the plane wreck?

241
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:09,100
Excuse me? Fine. You can be in charge.
You fix the plane.

242
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,600
Who gives you the authority
to put me in charge?

243
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,700
OK, then I'll remain in charge.

244
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,600
Yeah, you will remain in charge.

245
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,400
You and your hippie friends
stay out of our hair.

246
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,300
Correcto-mundo. Because I decided to.

247
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,200
- Good for you.
- Well, this discussion isn't over.

248
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,600
Higher mammals! Stay with us.

249
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,700
We could use your front cortexes
and opposable thumbs.

250
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,700
Phil! I should wash
your hands out with soap.

251
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,500
How in the hell-o
will they fix this plane?!

252
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,600
You know, grit and spit and spit.

253
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,500
A lot of spit and grit and
stick-to-it-iveness.

254
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,800
That don't sound too promising.

255
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,400
You're right. We're stuck here.

256
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,500
As long as we're together, we'll be OK.

257
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,900
Yeah, but love ain't gonna get us home.

258
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,300
Behold! The lion!

259
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,000
- People!
- There is much to see. Moving on.

260
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,400
Wait, wait, wait! People!

261
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,300
- They'll help us!
- Wait up!

262
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,100
- People! Stop!
- Help us!

263
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,800
If you stop, I'll autograph those!

264
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,400
I know you!

265
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,500
You.

266
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,600
It's the bad kitty.

267
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,600
How do you like some of that?!

268
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,800
Come in, Tokyo!

269
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,000
Right in the batteries.

270
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,900
You think an old lady
can't take care of herself?

271
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,300
Next time, I won't go so easy on you!

272
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,700
Thank you, dear.

273
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,300
Moving on!

274
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,800
Are you out of your mind?
We need help and you harass old ladies?!

275
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,100
Out of my mind?

276
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,000
Who's out of my mind now?

277
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,400
- See if you can get an operator.
- No problem.

278
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,800
Out of my mind. We're going home.

279
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,500
Message E-4.

280
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,400
The service user has roamed
outside the coverage area.

281
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,000
Please try again later.

282
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,000
Am I trippin'?

283
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,500
All those zebras... like me.

284
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,200
- Where are we?
- San Diego.

285
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,900
This time I'm 40 percent sure.

286
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,500
- I know this place.
- I think it's Africa.

287
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,800
Africa?

288
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,400
It's got to be.

289
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,200
Our ancestral crib.

290
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,700
It's in our blood. I can feel it!

291
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,400
No, it's more than that. It's like...

292
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,600
...déjà vu, like I've been here before.

293
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,400
It's like Roots!

294
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,100
No, it's like...

295
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,600
...déjà vu, like I've been here before.

296
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,900
How!

297
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,100
How!

298
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,600
Me Alex!

299
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,100
Me and me friends fly,

300
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,400
fly in great metal bird.

301
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,100
Then plummet!

302
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,400
Smash ground!

303
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,900
Go boom!

304
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,300
Then here we emerge.

305
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,600
We offer only happiness

306
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,400
and good greetings.

307
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,800
Is he dancing about a plane crash?

308
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,300
Yeah. We just... yeah.

309
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,300
I thought... Sorry.

310
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,500
You came from off the reserve?

311
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,600
Way off. From the Central Park Zoo,
actually.

312
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,000
Don't strain yourself.

313
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,400
What's going on here?

314
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,200
They say they're from off the reserve.

315
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,700
That's impossible. Only people
come from off the reserve.

316
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,900
You look familiar. Do I know you?

317
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,500
How could you survive the hunters?

318
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,900
We didn't see any hunters.

319
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,800
- What are you looking at?
- Me? Nothing.

320
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,100
This watering hole doesn't need
any more mouths to feed.

321
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,700
So skedaddle back
to where you came from.

322
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,100
Is there a manager we could talk to?

323
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,200
I see. You're here to challenge me!

324
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,000
What? No! No.

325
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,900
That's what it looks like to me!

326
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,500
Zuba! Wait.

327
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,500
I'm trying to take care of business...

328
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,200
Yeah, yeah, Zuba. Hold on.

329
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,200
Alakay?

330
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,300
Is that you?

331
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,900
No, it's Alex. lx. Like New York Knicks.

332
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,300
Zuba, look!

333
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,300
I've always had that.
The vet checked it out.

334
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,700
It's kind of a beauty spot, really.

335
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,400
A mark.

336
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,000
All right, this is a little weird.

337
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,200
Honey, he's come home.

338
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,200
What?

339
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,200
You've come home.

340
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,600
Son.

341
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,900
Dad.

342
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,000
Mom and Dad? Mom and Dad!

343
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,400
Mom and Dad! It's my mom and dad!

344
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,000
I got a mom and dad!

345
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,600
My baby's alive!

346
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,200
Dad!

347
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,100
My son!

348
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,400
My son is home!

349
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,400
Alakay! Alakay has come home!

350
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,900
Alakay! Yeah! The prodigal son returns.
This is perfect!

351
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,400
I thought you hated Zuba.

352
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:30,200
No, I do. I do. I do.
I hate him. Oh, I do.

353
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,800
And I'm going to use Alakay, yes.

354
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:36,400
I'm going to use him
to get rid of Zuba once and for all!

355
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,300
Giddy-up, feathered horse!

356
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:41,200
Make way!
Move out of the way! Stand aside!

357
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,900
New York!

358
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:47,200
It's a bit of a dump.
Are you sure we're not in New Jersey?

359
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,500
Hello, New Yorkers!
Your new king is here!

360
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,900
This calls for a celebration!

361
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,800
Maurice, I think they like me.

362
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,400
You've got to love
a non-hostile takeover!

363
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,800
Chukka-chukka what?

364
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,400
Excuse me. I'm Marty.
I'm kind of new around here.

365
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,900
Hey, Marty!

366
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,400
You're a good-looking group!
You like to run?

367
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,100
Yeah. Running is crack-a-lackin'.

368
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,900
That's right! Crack-a-lackin'.

369
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
You guys speak
my crack-a-lackin' language.

370
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,500
What? You don't have doctors here?

371
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,100
Not anymore.

372
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,600
Well, what if you catch a cold?

373
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,800
We go over to the dying holes
and we die.

374
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,600
You guys really need a doctor.

375
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,800
- We have an opening.
- Would you be interested?

376
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,400
Me? A doctor?

377
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,700
It's raining men. Hallelujah!
You all got it going on.

378
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,800
Why don't you have a man? You got worms?

379
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,400
Oh, I got rid of those. Listen, girls.

380
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,500
Manhattan is short on two things,
parking and hippos.

381
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,700
Hey, everybody!
I just found out that my son

382
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,800
is a doggone king!
The King of New York!

383
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,600
Show me some of your moves, son.
Don't be bashful.

384
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,300
All right. This one
always knocks 'em dead.

385
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,200
Roar!

386
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:27,400
Look out. The King is mad.
The King is mad!

387
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:32,300
Let's welcome him back
into the pride with open arms!

388
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,800
Welcome to the herd, Marty!

389
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:41,300
Me? I've always wanted
to be part of a herd!

390
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,700
- It's one for all...
- [all] And all for all, y'all!

391
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,800
How do I look?

392
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:53,100
Technically, a traditional witch doctor
has a bone through his nose.

393
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,700
Don't worry... it's just a clip-on.

394
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,500
Voilà! He's a witch doctor!

395
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,100
My mother will be so happy.

396
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,100
Look out! I think Moto Moto likes you.

397
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,900
Here he comes.

398
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,500
I like 'em big

399
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,900
I like 'em chunky

400
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:24,100
I like 'em big
I like 'em plumpy

401
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,900
I like 'em round
With somethin' somethin'

402
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,200
They like my sound
They think I'm funky

403
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,600
Goodness, girl... you huge.

404
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,900
Who's your friend? Or is that your butt?

405
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,400
You as quick as you are hefty.

406
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,000
So you're Moto Moto?

407
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,300
The name's so nice, you say it twice.

408
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,200
I kind of like it, fatso.

409
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:50,500
I'll see you around, girl. It won't
be hard, because you so... plumpy.

410
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,900
Cops!

411
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,200
I hate to be a party pooper, Zuba,

412
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:07,700
but some of the lions were wondering
when you plan to banish your son.

413
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,200
- What are you talking about?
- It's nothing, really.

414
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,900
They're griping that Alakay
never went through

415
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,100
the rite of passage,
blah, blah, blah,

416
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:21,600
so technically speaking, he can't be
a member of the pride. It's nonsense.

417
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:24,000
I forgot about the rite of passage.

418
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,300
What is it? What's this rite of passage?

419
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,900
A traditional coming-of-age ceremony.

420
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,700
Young lions earn their manes
by demonstrating their skills.

421
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,500
- A show-of-skill talent show deal?
- Yeah. Strutting their stuff.

422
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,700
A performance!
I think that's up my alley.

423
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,600
If it's tradition, I want to do it.
Strut my stuff. Earn my mane.

424
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,400
I want to be Alaki.

425
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,800
- Alakay.
- Alakay! Even better.

426
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,500
We will hold the rite
of passage in the morning!

427
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,300
That's wonderful! Good luck, Alakay.

428
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,600
Where I'm from, we say, "Break a leg."

429
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,900
That's my boy!

430
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,100
I'm a private dancer

431
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,600
A dancer for money

432
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,500
Any old music will do

433
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,200
Beautiful, isn't it?

434
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,300
It's amazing.

435
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,500
Guys...

436
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
...this is where we belong.

437
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,300
Operation Tourist Trap is a go.

438
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,400
Oh, I like that one.

439
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,200
It works on many levels.

440
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,100
You guys are a bunch of suck-ups.

441
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,700
- That, too.
- Absolutely.

442
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,600
Stations.

443
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,600
Stage one. Go!

444
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,200
Oh, no! What have I done?

445
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,800
Come on, take the bait.

446
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,500
- What happened?
- Oh, look at the poor little guy.

447
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,100
Is it dead?

448
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,300
Stage two! Go, go, go!

449
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,500
I will give him the kiss of life.

450
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,200
Rico!

451
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,200
Rico!

452
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,800
Reverse!

453
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,900
Gas!

454
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,200
Music!

455
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,600
No! Stop! Stop!

456
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,600
Stop!

457
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,100
Come back!

458
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,900
What is all this rock'n'roll racket?!

459
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,200
Is she dead?

460
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
No!

461
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,100
You hoodlums!

462
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,900
Good heavens! Are you OK?

463
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,200
Lady, I found your pocketbook.

464
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:19,000
My handbag. Such a good boy.

465
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,300
Nana can't survive without it.

466
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,500
You are one tough cookie.

467
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,600
Brownies Troop 416, Yonkers.

468
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,400
OK, nobody panic! The best thing
we can do is stay together.

469
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:34,100
We'll wait for another tourjeep.
It may take hours, but...

470
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,300
Where are you going?

471
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,700
I'm not staying here to be attacked
by more animals! I'm too old to die.

472
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:45,600
I'm going with her. Old lady, wait up!

473
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,400
Please! We need to stay...

474
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,300
...together.

475
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,400
Fine! We'll go that way!

476
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,100
Does anyone want a hard candy?

477
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,300
- Easy now.
- Watch your step.

478
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,800
And right here... OK, are you ready?

479
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,000
This is where you always slept.

480
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,800
Oh, man!

481
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:20,100
- Was this mine?
- Look at you. Look at him.

482
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,600
Oh, this thing. Look, look!

483
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,500
- I remember this!
- He remembers.

484
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,500
A little harder than...

485
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:32,500
You never slept on the right end.
You always slept on the bottom end.

486
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,500
Is that...?

487
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,100
Is that my...?

488
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,500
Is that me?

489
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,200
You had the cutest little paws.

490
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,800
Little, little bitty ol' paws.

491
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,800
You did that the day we lost you.

492
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,800
Wow. I was so young.

493
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,900
What happened to me?

494
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,400
It was all my fault.
I turned my back and...

495
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,400
It was not your fault.

496
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:05,700
Your father did everything he could.
He tracked those hunters for weeks.

497
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,400
Far off the reserve.

498
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,700
Finally, I had to assume the hunters...

499
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,200
...well...

500
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,800
We thought they'd killed you.

501
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,500
But my son fought them off!
Don't mess with the King of New York!

502
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,300
- That's right!
- Keep your chin in.

503
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:26,700
You boys be careful!
Watch out before you break something.

504
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,000
You used to call this "foofie."

505
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,600
"Foofie"?

506
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,800
Foofie.

507
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,400
He doesn't want that.

508
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,100
This is my foofie!

509
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,100
Zuba, you better give him his foofie.

510
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:47,400
I mean, no, thank you,
thank you. It's perfect.

511
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:51,100
Son, you get your rest.
You have a big day tomorrow.

512
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,600
You'll need all your strength.

513
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,100
I will bring the house down for you.

514
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,200
I hope so. Otherwise,
your father will have to banish you.

515
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,200
Jeez, Mom, really?

516
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,500
I know you'll do us proud. You know why?

517
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,400
You were born with it.

518
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,400
Good night, Alakay.

519
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,400
My boy. My own boy.

520
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,800
My son's a king.

521
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,800
My son's a king.

522
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,500
Good night, Mom.

523
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,500
Good night, Alakay.

524
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,600
Foofie.

525
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,500
Look at foofie! My foofie!

526
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,700
Foofie, foofie, foofie. My foofie!

527
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:58,300
No sign of civilization.
Everybody appears very tired.

528
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,600
I think we're lost.

529
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,500
Nana, do you know where you're going?

530
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:08,200
No, but I'm going with a skip
in my step and a smile on my face.

531
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,600
Sure, right, OK. Yeah, all right.

532
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,800
- It's people.
- How did you get here?

533
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,600
- Can you help us? We're lost.
- We're lost too.

534
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:23,300
It was awful. A flash of black and white
and they were gone. They took the jeep!

535
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,100
- That happened to ourjeep too!
- What do we do?

536
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,600
How will we all survive?

537
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:31,600
No food, no water, no shelter.
What are we gonna do?!

538
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,600
You can let nature
get the best of you,

539
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,100
or you can get the best of nature.

540
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,400
Gather 'round, children.
We're New Yorkers, right?

541
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,700
Yeah.

542
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,300
We survive the concrete jungle!

543
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:53,800
When we need food, we hunt
for a decent hot dog stand.

544
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,500
- Am I right?
- She's right.

545
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,000
When we need shelter,
we build skyscrapers.

546
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:03,600
- Exactly!
- When we need water, we build a dam.

547
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,800
We're New Yorkers, for crying out loud!

548
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,300
If we can make it there,

549
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,900
we can make it anywhere!

550
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,200
I'm coming, King Julien!

551
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,100
Bad fishy! Bad fishy!

552
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,100
No, shark, no! Sit!

553
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,300
Why am I laughing?

554
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:54,200
We have all the parts we need,
but we're slightly behind schedule.

555
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,600
- How slightly?
- Six to nine years.

556
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,900
- Sixty-nine years?
- No, six to nine years.

557
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,700
Private! What happened to our thumbs?

558
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,900
Haven't seen them since yesterday.

559
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,800
Darn you, Darwin!

560
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,800
Nobody goes AWOL on my watch.
Private! You're coming with me.

561
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,800
Rico! You're coming with me!

562
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:19,400
- We'll bring them in for court martial.
- That won't be necessary!

563
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:23,100
We've recruited
a few extra thumbs for you, Skipper.

564
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,500
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.

565
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,600
Oh, I doubt that.

566
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,300
Enough lollygagging. Let's get to work.

567
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:46,400
There'll be three groups. Group Alpha
will do sheet metal fabrication.

568
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:50,700
Group Bronson handles assembly.
Group George Peppard, craft services.

569
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,200
Any questions?

570
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,000
Good! Let's get to work.

571
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:05,200
I'd like to kiss you, monkey man.

572
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:09,000
All right, but you're so darn ugly.

573
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,600
Remember, little cub scouts, a great
dance performance comes from the heart.

574
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,000
Straight from the heart,
you'll never go wrong.

575
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,000
Sure, mister.

576
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,100
Hey, Alakay, I just happened to walk by,
I thought I'd wish you luck.

577
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,600
- You're not nervous, are you?
- Nah, it's my thing.

578
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:37,500
In my opinion, the key to this
is choosing the right competitor.

579
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,800
You mean, this is like
a dance battle sort of thing?

580
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,900
- Like a dance-off?
- Sure.

581
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,400
Great. I love that. Freestyle.

582
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:49,500
Who'd be a good match for me?
Just to keep things interesting.

583
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,500
Well, I wish I could help,

584
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,400
but that's strictly against our ancient
tradition and all we hold sacred.

585
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:00,200
But if it was me out there...
I'd choose Teetsi.

586
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:04,300
Teetsi. OK. Sounds interesting.

587
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,900
Makunga, right? Thank you.

588
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,600
Anything for Zuba's boy.
Go get 'em, tiger.

589
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,200
Shake it out.

590
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,700
A five, six, seven, eight.

591
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,400
Let's go, let's do this.

592
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,300
Let us begin
the rite of passage ceremony.

593
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,700
- Come on, baby! Make Mama proud!
- Woman, I'm trying to take...

594
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,900
On it, Mom!

595
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,800
Who will be the first participant?

596
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,400
Me! Oh! Me, me, me!
Me! Me! Me! Me, me! Please, me?

597
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,100
How about you? The tall, handsome one.

598
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,100
Yeah. Choose your opponent.

599
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,400
Let me see.

600
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,100
I guess I'll pick...

601
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,200
...Teetsi?

602
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,700
Teetsi? Why did he pick Teetsi?

603
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,300
That's my boy!
He's got some gumption there!

604
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,000
Somebody, wake him up!

605
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,400
All right, so, Teetsi, come on.
Let's do this, huh?

606
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:32,000
Come on, little tsetse fly.
Let's see your stuff. Bring it.

607
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,200
- Let's dance!
- OK.

608
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,100
But let me warn you
that I am a protégé of...

609
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,000
...Fosse and Robbins!

610
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,800
Not "dance" dance! Fight!

611
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:46,000
Dance fight! You got it.

612
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,600
- Is he dancing?
- What's he doing?

613
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,000
I know that boy is not dancing.

614
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,800
This is even better than I thought.

615
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,200
Alakay, turn around!

616
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:08,500
No, Pop, it's hop, shuffle,
ball change, hip swish, turn around.

617
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,900
Oh, no.

618
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,300
Alakay! Are you hurt?

619
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,300
Yeah, I am.

620
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,300
Did I... did I win?

621
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,700
No, son.

622
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,900
How could this happen?

623
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:35,000
You told us you were a king.
A king does not get beat.

624
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:39,100
I am a king. I'm the King of New York.

625
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:43,600
It's my stage name.
Like for when I perform.

626
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,800
Perform?

627
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:49,200
Oh, no, this is horrible!
Alakay has failed the test!

628
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:54,500
Who would have ever imagined
that today Zuba would have to banish...

629
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,700
...his own son?

630
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,900
Zuba, no.

631
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,800
Zuba, yes.

632
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:05,000
Sadly, the alpha lion
must cast out all failures.

633
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:20,100
Then I'm no longer the alpha lion.

634
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,800
Dad, what are you doing?

635
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,000
Dad, no! You can't do this.

636
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,700
Who could possibly take Zuba's place?

637
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,000
Anyone?

638
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,200
Someone? No one?

639
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,600
You, sir!

640
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,300
I guess not.

641
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,300
Well, I... this is all very awkward,

642
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:46,200
but I suppose I could carry
this tremendous burden.

643
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,200
Teetsi! Get the hat.

644
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:55,700
As your new leader,
I hereby banish Alakay!

645
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
He shall wear this Hat of Shame...

646
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:01,000
...and leave the watering hole

647
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,900
for a thousand years, or life!

648
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,900
Whichever comes last.

649
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,700
Shoo, shoo! Get out of here!

650
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,200
You should have told us
you weren't a real king, son!

651
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,900
You never told me
I'd have to fight anybody!

652
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,200
What did you expect?!

653
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:25,800
I don't know! Maybe a little fatherly
advice like, "Hey, son, it's a fight!"

654
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,700
- You're a lion!
- But I never fought another lion!

655
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,700
No, I guess not. You dance!

656
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,800
And other stuff! Your pal, Makunga,
set me up back there!

657
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:37,700
- None of this would have happened...
- If you were a real lion.

658
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,500
- Zuba!
- Yeah, I said it!

659
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,900
A real lion.

660
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,200
Thanks.

661
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,100
Thanks a lot.

662
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,300
Saw.

663
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,900
Suture.

664
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,100
Swab.

665
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,700
You're in my light, Stephen.

666
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,600
You have a brown spot on your shoulder.

667
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:16,400
That's very observant, Stephen. As you
can see, I'm covered in brown spots.

668
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:20,100
OK! That bone will be good
as new in a few weeks.

669
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,500
So I don't have
to pick out a dying hole?

670
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,000
No, you got
your whole life ahead of you.

671
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,600
- Really?
- Go out and grab it by the horns.

672
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:31,300
- Thank you, Dr. Mankiewicz!
- Break a leg! Sweet kid.

673
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,400
This spot looks
like Witch Doctor's Disease.

674
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,800
Witch Doctor's Disease? That's the most
ridiculous disease I've ever heard of.

675
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,000
- Don't ask.
- Someone's been knotty.

676
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:45,700
This won't hurt a bit.

677
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,200
Joe, our last witch doctor,
had a spotjust like that.

678
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:54,500
- And?
- Monday, Joe. Wednesday, no Joe.

679
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,500
Wednesday, no Joe?

680
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,100
I can breathe! Thanks, doc!

681
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:03,200
So this Witch Doctor's Disease
is a real thing?

682
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:07,100
You'll find a cure.
You've got at least 48 hours!

683
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,300
But I've never heard of it.

684
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:12,600
I mean... I don't have any penicillin.

685
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:15,100
I'll need a CAT scan
just to get started!

686
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,500
Have a lion look you over.
They'd be happy to.

687
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,200
Ta-da!!

688
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:33,100
- He has talent.
- Stupendous and tremendous.

689
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,700
Hollah!

690
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,000
Bet you've never seen that one!
Knocked 'em dead in New York!

691
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
- Let's all give it a try!
- Let's do it!

692
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,800
Well, you can try all you want to,

693
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,900
but it takes years of practice.

694
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,000
You'll never get a tight stream

695
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,500
until you build up your lip muscles
to the point where you can

696
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,700
purse your lips like this.
You got it?

697
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,700
Ta-da!

698
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,800
How did you...? You guys got it
right out of the box!

699
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:18,700
- If you can do it...
...we can do it.

700
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,000
It's in our blood!

701
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,000
I always thought I was a bit unique.

702
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,200
We are unique!

703
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,300
We are like a force of nature!

704
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,200
- A million points of light!
- And dark stripes!

705
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,500
Exactly the same!

706
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,900
Exactly the same.

707
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:39,900
Looks impressive,
Kowalski, but will it fly?

708
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:43,700
Yes. If we fold it here, here and here.

709
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:46,900
Nice.

710
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:03,400
Oh, man. My dad thinks
I'm a total loser.

711
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:05,400
I've ruined my parents' lives.

712
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,600
That is definitely not crack-a-lackin'.

713
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:12,300
It is lackin' in the crackin',
my friend. I've gotta fix this.

714
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,800
So...

715
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,300
...there's...
There's something I gotta tell you.

716
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:19,400
Hey, guys.

717
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,400
Is this place great or what?!

718
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:24,400
I'd go with "or what."

719
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:28,100
Well, I'll tell you what.
You're not gonna believe it, but...

720
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,100
...I got a date with Moto Moto.

721
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,500
Who's Moto Moto?

722
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:37,100
Oh, he's so big and handsome and big!

723
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,800
- Know what "Moto Moto" means?
- Twins?

724
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,800
It means, "Hot Hot."

725
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,100
"Hot Hot"?

726
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,000
When did you start parlez-ing African?

727
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:47,200
It's in my blood.

728
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:51,100
Don't worry, you can flirt around
with Mr. Hot Pants after I'm gone.

729
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,100
Melman, why am I the parade
and you're the rain?

730
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:56,300
Why are you driving
your parade under my rain?

731
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,100
Maybe I'll parade
in another part of town!

732
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,500
Whoa, guys.

733
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:02,200
Main Street's mine!

734
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:04,500
Well, you can have it!

735
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:08,700
And you can take your hotee-tot float
and Mr. Hotee Moto Moto...

736
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,900
- What are you talking about?
- What are we talking about?

737
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,500
Melman, just tell her.

738
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,500
What? What are you...
I don't know what you're talking about.

739
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,100
I guess I'll go, then.

740
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,600
Don't bother.

741
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:23,300
- Don't get up on my account.
- Melman! Gloria!

742
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:27,700
- I thought you guys were friends!
- Marty's absolutely right.

743
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,500
- Marty?
- Marty?

744
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:30,800
Marty?

745
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,400
What the heck is going on?

746
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:38,600
You're not...? Oh! He was... I thought
he... You're not him. He's... Oh.

747
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:41,500
You thought that guy...

748
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,800
...was me?

749
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:45,600
No. I mean, yes, you... Guys, come on.

750
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,900
You thought I was him?

751
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,200
You guys kind of do look a little...

752
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,900
You look a lot alike.
Marty, you look a lot alike.

753
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,900
You laugh alike. Talk alike.
He has the same speech pattern.

754
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
It's a little weird, really.
I mean, come on. Marty.

755
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:03,300
So you're saying there's
nothing unique about me.

756
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,600
I'm just like any other zebra.

757
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,200
No. Of course you're different!

758
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,900
How?

759
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,700
OK, I can't tell you apart.

760
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:15,900
Maybe you could wear
a bell or something.

761
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,600
- A bell?!
- OK, not a bell. Bell's a bad idea.

762
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,600
How about a T-shirt that says,
"I'm with stupid"?

763
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,300
- I'm not stupid!
- Not you, stupid! Him, stupid!

764
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,900
You know, while you've been doing
the prancing pony with your new posse,

765
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:31,400
I've been having
the worst day of my life.

766
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,100
It's always about you, isn't it?

767
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,700
My problems are just
a little bit bigger than yours.

768
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,600
I couldn't tell you apart. So what?!

769
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:44,900
Yeah, fine. Run away, Marty! Run away!

770
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,300
That's what you do best!
Just like back in New York!

771
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,800
I'm right here.
But you can't tell that, right?

772
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,300
Your one-of-a-million friend
hopes you enjoy

773
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,200
your bigger-than-anyone-else's
problems alone!

774
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:03,900
Good, leave! I don't need you
to help me solve my problems!

775
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,100
You're a dime a dozen!
I can't tell which one's Marty!

776
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,200
Which one's Marty? Wait a minute.
Oh, yeah, I don't care!

777
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:13,000
Nice hat, you showoff!

778
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:19,800
Marty...

779
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,300
...don't go.

780
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,000
Giddy-up, giddy-up!

781
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,300
Giddy-up, giddy-up!

782
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,600
Look, Maurice!

783
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:31,200
The perfect spot for my summer palace!

784
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:35,300
Please fill in all these holes
and relocate the riff-raff.

785
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,700
- Who'd leave a perfectly good head?
- What a waste.

786
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Tell me about it. I'm in my prime here.

787
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:45,600
I'm terminal, you know?

788
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:50,100
I probably only have
another two days left to live.

789
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:52,500
That's a bummer, man.

790
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,500
If I, King Julien... that's my name...

791
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,000
...only had two days left to live,

792
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:59,800
I would do all the things

793
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,300
- I've ever dreamed of doing.
- Like what?

794
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,400
I'd love to become
a professional whistler.

795
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:09,800
I'm pretty amazing at it now,
but I want to get even better,

796
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,800
make my living out of it.

797
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:25,500
You know what else I would do?
I would invade a neighboring country

798
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:29,500
and impose my own ideology,
even if they didn't want it!

799
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,500
Easy for you to say. You're a king.

800
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:35,700
Yes. And you are
only just a sad little head.

801
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:39,800
There must be something
you want to do before you die!

802
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:43,800
- There is this one thing.
- What? Tell me.

803
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:46,900
- No, I couldn't.
- What is it?

804
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,600
I never told Gloria
how I feel about her.

805
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:51,500
What is it? Please tell me!

806
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:55,300
I never had the guts
to tell Gloria how I feel about her.

807
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,000
How I've always felt about her.

808
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:58,900
Fine. Don't tell me!

809
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:04,200
Is it a woman?
You didn't tell me it's a woman.

810
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:08,600
What are you afraid of?
You're a dead man anyway.

811
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:10,800
Yeah. Yeah.

812
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,900
You're right.

813
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:16,200
You've got to march
right up to this woman.

814
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:19,600
Look her right in the eye. Lean forward.

815
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:22,400
Just a little, or almost all the way.

816
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,700
Then you let her lean forward
a little until you're...

817
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:30,200
...just lips' distance
away from each other.

818
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:33,900
Then you tell her how much you hate her.

819
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:38,500
Actually, it's more like love her.

820
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,400
Oh, you sly dog! Woof, woof!

821
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:45,100
You're a real player. Now listen to me.

822
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:48,000
You got to rise up. You hearing me?

823
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:49,700
- He didn't hear you.
- I can't hear you!

824
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,800
- You got to rise up!
- Rising up!

825
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,400
- Get out of the hole!
- I'm rising out of the ground!

826
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,500
- He's rising, Maurice.
- I'm rising, Maurice!

827
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,500
- Rising!
- You go right up to this woman!

828
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,400
Do you feel it?

829
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,100
- Go up to her face!
- Tell the truth!

830
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:11,400
- I'm going to tell her!
- Then you say, "Baby, I dig you!"

831
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,600
Yeah! I'm going to do it!
I'm going to do it!

832
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,200
I love that happy little head.

833
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,500
She love

834
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,400
Moto Moto

835
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,600
She love

836
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,200
Moto Moto

837
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,800
She loves me
She loves my eyes

838
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:32,800
She loves me
She loves my thighs

839
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,000
She loves my roundness

840
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:39,200
She love that I'm chunky
She love that I'm plumpy

841
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:43,300
She love my heftiness
She love my zestiness

842
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:47,500
She love me restlessly
She love me forever

843
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,500
She love me...

844
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,300
...'cause she love me

845
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,800
Moto Moto...

846
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,500
...before things get too serious, well,

847
00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:00,800
I was wondering,
if I were to, for example, stay here...

848
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,500
...l'd like to ask you...

849
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:07,200
Let your candied lips be
the messengers to my... ear canal.

850
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,600
I have so many questions.

851
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:13,300
I promise the answer will always be yes.

852
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,000
Unless no is required.

853
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:20,400
So what is it about me
that you find so interesting?

854
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:24,000
You're the most plumpenest girl
I've ever met.

855
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
OK. Other than that.

856
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:27,700
Let's see.

857
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,800
Yeah, well, you know... you chunky.

858
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:33,100
Right.

859
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:37,400
My gosh, girl, you huge.

860
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:38,700
You said that.

861
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:40,900
Yeah, that's right.

862
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,600
We don't have to talk no more.

863
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,000
Gloria!

864
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,300
Gloria.

865
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:48,700
Melman.

866
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:54,600
Melman, I want you to meet Moto Moto.

867
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:59,700
Moto Moto. Yeah, nice to meet you.

868
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:03,700
- I guess I...
- It's OK, Melman.

869
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,300
Apology accepted.

870
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:10,100
Oh. Yeah, right, that.
That's why I... Good.

871
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:13,600
OK. Well, that's it, then.

872
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,800
Good. We're kind of busy here, man.

873
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:19,600
No. No, that's not it.

874
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:24,100
Listen, Mototo, you better treat
this lady like a queen.

875
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,900
Because you, my friend,
you found yourself the perfect woman.

876
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,700
If I was ever so lucky
to find the perfect woman,

877
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,500
I'd give her flowers every day.
And notjust any flowers. OK?

878
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:38,600
Her favorites are orchids.
White. And breakfast in bed.

879
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,000
Six loaves of wheat toast,
butter on both sides.

880
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,700
No crust, the way she likes it.

881
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,300
I'd be her shoulder to cry on
and her best friend.

882
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:50,100
I'd spend every day thinking
of how to make her laugh.

883
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:53,800
She has the most amazing laugh.

884
00:54:57,100 --> 00:55:00,100
That's what I would do if I were you.

885
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,800
But I'm not, so you do it.

886
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,800
OK.

887
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,200
What?

888
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:11,700
That was beautiful.

889
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:15,200
Anyways, where were we?

890
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:17,000
I'm "huge"?

891
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,500
Surprised to see me, Makunga?

892
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:23,800
Well, I'm here to set things straight,
like a real lion!

893
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:28,200
Is this real enough for you? How
about this? This is for setting me up!

894
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:32,200
This is for stealing my dad's job!
This is for humiliating my family!

895
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:34,800
And making me look like a fool!

896
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:54,500
Had enough? Sure, fly away!

897
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:56,200
Coward.

898
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,700
The water. It's gone.

899
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,900
It's never gone dry before.

900
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,800
- We'll need a lot more dying holes.
- How could this happen?

901
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:18,200
Out of my way! What is going on here?!

902
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:21,100
The watering hole is dry!
There's barely water for one of us!

903
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,500
- Good observation, Shirley.
- I'm Bobby.

904
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,100
Makunga, what do we do?

905
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:26,600
Quiet!

906
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:32,100
Listen up! I'm afraid there is only
one solution to this horrible crisis:

907
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:34,800
We'll all have to fight for it.

908
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:37,400
- We can't fight for it.
- That's crazy.

909
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,400
That's not fair. You'd win!

910
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:41,900
Exactly, Shirley.

911
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:43,100
I'm Bob...

912
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:47,000
Sorry, folks, but life isn't fair.
I'm in charge now,

913
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:50,200
thanks to Alakay, the dancing lion.

914
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:54,000
Please, Makunga, this is
the only water on the reserve.

915
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:58,100
If you're thirsty, you'll have to look
for water off the reserve.

916
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,700
- Off the reserve?
- It's too dangerous!

917
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,200
Hunters would shoot us!

918
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:04,200
No one leaves the reserve and survives!

919
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:06,100
I left the reserve!

920
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,300
And survived.

921
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,500
I can do something about this.

922
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:15,900
Looks like a clogged pipe, like we
get in New York. I'll travel upriver...

923
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,100
- Upriver?
- Off the reserve?

924
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,300
You?

925
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:23,400
Yeah. I'll unclog the pipe
and bring back your water.

926
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:28,600
Great! I'd help you pack, but by the
looks of that hat, I see you're all set!

927
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:34,300
Fine. Go ahead, laugh. Laugh
your mane off. I'll prove you wrong.

928
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:37,500
Maybe you should try
a little rain dance.

929
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,700
Zuba would know what to do.

930
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,800
- Where's Zuba?
- You don't care about us.

931
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,100
Zuba should be in charge, not you.

932
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,400
All right, fine!

933
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:59,100
As an added measure,
I will consult with Zuba!

934
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:07,000
Marty?

935
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,800
Hey! Marty!

936
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:24,200
Marty?

937
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,600
Marty.

938
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,300
Where'd you get the fruity hat?

939
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:32,900
Excuse me! Excuse me!

940
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,200
Hi. Is Marty in there?

941
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:39,000
Anyone seen Marty?

942
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:43,200
Which one of us is Marty?

943
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:46,400
All right. Well, if you see him,

944
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,900
tell him his friend Alex
came to say goodbye.

945
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,700
Goodbye? Don't go. Where are you going?

946
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:55,100
- Can we come?
- No. I have to do this alone.

947
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,400
You can't leave the reserve!

948
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,100
What are you doing?

949
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,600
- They'll get your hat.
- Hunters are everywhere!

950
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,100
Could you leave the hat?

951
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:16,800
Marty! I know you're in there.

952
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:20,900
Before I go, I got something
I want to say.

953
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:24,200
You've been a great friend.

954
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:27,700
You've helped me so often
to see the bright side of my problems

955
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:29,700
that I never think of you having any.

956
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,600
I wasn't there for you
when you needed me.

957
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:35,900
Just like back at the zoo.

958
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:41,100
What kind of friend does that make me?
A pretty lousy friend, I guess.

959
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:43,600
I just want you to know that I...

960
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,400
You're one in a million.

961
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:48,800
This is touching.

962
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,300
It is touching.

963
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:54,100
So could you turn around
so I can tell you to your face?

964
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,800
That's right. Gotcha!

965
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:59,700
I see you in there! Yeah, you.

966
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,700
You, right there.

967
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:06,000
Twelfth row, two hundred
and third from the left.

968
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:07,500
That's you, Marty.

969
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,600
I know it's you.

970
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:13,500
Know what makes you special?

971
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:18,300
These guys are white with black stripes.
You're black with white stripes.

972
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,200
You're a dreamer, Marty.

973
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:24,100
Always have been.
You have great taste in music

974
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,800
and horrible taste in friends.

975
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:30,300
Well, not Melman and Gloria, but me.

976
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,100
OK, I'm in.

977
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:36,500
Marty, you can't come with me.

978
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,300
You don't have a choice.

979
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,800
- People are out there!
- You're crazy! Come back!

980
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:47,800
The people will get you!

981
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:50,200
Don't lose the hat!

982
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:52,400
Bye, hat!

983
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,100
Any water?

984
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,800
No, just more diamonds and gold.

985
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:07,500
Don't give up hope.

986
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:10,500
Listen up! I will help you!

987
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,700
There's only one way
to get your precious water.

988
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:17,000
I, your beloved King Julien

989
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:22,200
must simply make a small sacrifice
to my good friends, the water gods,

990
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:25,400
in the volcano!

991
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:30,000
What does that do?

992
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:32,900
What does that do? Excellent question.

993
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:36,300
My sacrifice goes in the volcano.

994
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:40,400
The friendly gods eat up my sacrifice.

995
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:42,900
"Thank you for the sacrifice."

996
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:45,800
"Here, have another."
"No, I've had enough."

997
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:48,300
"I'll be insulted
unless you have another."

998
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:50,800
"I don't want another sacrifice!"

999
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:53,900
"Look at you! You're skinny!"
"No! I've had enough!"

1000
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,500
The gods eat the sacrifice.
They are grateful.

1001
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:03,400
They give me some water,
and then I give it to you.

1002
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:04,700
What?

1003
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,300
Does it work?

1004
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:09,100
No! I mean, yes.

1005
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,100
Well, Maurice?

1006
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,700
Ah, it's fifty-fifty.

1007
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:16,600
We'll do it!

1008
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:18,900
Excellent!

1009
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:23,500
Now all I need is someone
who would like to go into the volcano

1010
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:25,500
and get eaten by gods.

1011
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:28,800
Any hands! Hands, anybody!

1012
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:32,400
I need someone, perhaps
who has never found love,

1013
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:37,700
who could look death straight
in the eyeball. A real, genuine hero.

1014
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:39,800
- I'll do it.
- Melman?

1015
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:52,900
Hurry up! Before we all
come to our senses!

1016
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Melman, what is wrong with you?

1017
01:02:56,300 --> 01:03:01,000
I'm dying anyway. If there's a chance
it'll get you water, it's worth it.

1018
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:03,100
Are you nuts?

1019
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:05,800
I want you to know, back at the zoo,

1020
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:09,200
it was never the doctors
or prescriptions that kept me going.

1021
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:11,600
It was always you.

1022
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:14,100
Seeing you every day.

1023
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:16,300
That's what kept me going.

1024
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Melman! Wait!

1025
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:27,700
Melman! Melman! Melman!

1026
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:33,000
You going to mope like this all day?

1027
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,300
Don't "hmph" me.

1028
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:39,300
Listen, Zuba. A miracle happened.

1029
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:44,200
Our son came back to us. How come
that is not good enough for you?

1030
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:46,400
What are you saying, woman?

1031
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:51,500
We lost him once, Zuba.
Let's not lose him again.

1032
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:02,200
Zuba!

1033
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,800
- Zuba!
- Get out of here!

1034
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:06,800
What do you want?

1035
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,000
It's awful.

1036
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:10,400
The watering hole is dried up.

1037
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:13,400
Dried up? That's impossible!

1038
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:15,400
There's nothing left!

1039
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:19,200
You're alpha lion, Makunga.
What are you gonna do about it?

1040
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:23,500
Your son, Alakay, he said he
could fix it. He's gone upriver.

1041
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:25,200
- Off the reserve?!
- No!

1042
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:28,000
I tried to stop him.
I told him it was suicide.

1043
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,300
He was determined
to prove himself to you.

1044
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:34,500
You stay here, in case he comes back!

1045
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:38,700
Hurry, Zuba!

1046
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,700
I'm so parched.

1047
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:52,400
Is this place starting to freak you out?

1048
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:57,000
We'll slip in, find the problem.
Hunters will never know we were here.

1049
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:58,800
Why are we doing this?

1050
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:02,400
Maybe my dad will think I'm...

1051
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:05,300
I want to show him I'm a real lion.

1052
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:08,500
As opposed to a chocolate lion.

1053
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:14,000
I know this may sound hard to believe,
but apparently, lions don't dance.

1054
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:15,300
What?!

1055
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:18,000
As far as my dad is concerned.

1056
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:20,700
As far as people are concerned,
you're a hit.

1057
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:24,100
In New York. This is Africa...
much tougher crowd.

1058
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,200
Marty, this is it!

1059
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:29,800
This is the clog! Come on.

1060
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,900
Well, there's the water.

1061
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:43,600
Stay down. Look at that.

1062
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,300
Knit one, purl two.

1063
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,500
It's her.

1064
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,200
- Is this right?
- Very good.

1065
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:51,200
Nana, slow down.

1066
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:54,100
You're a little tangled, aren't you?

1067
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:56,500
No, don't pull. I'll do it.

1068
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,900
We need dynamite. Got any?

1069
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:03,100
Oh, snap! I just used
my last stick this morning!

1070
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:07,100
- Savages!
- Evasive maneuvers!

1071
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,800
- Serpentine, serpentine!
- Squiggly squid maneuver!

1072
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:12,600
Zag, zig-zag, zig ziggy zag!

1073
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,300
No, no! Squiggly squid!

1074
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:16,700
Etch A Sketch!

1075
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,000
That's too complex! Octopus, octopus!

1076
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:25,500
- Run, Marty!
- I can't leave you here!

1077
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:29,600
Go get help! Squiggly squid maneuver!
Go! Go! Squiggly squid!

1078
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:32,800
Etch A Sketch! Etch A Sketch!

1079
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,100
Save us
We love you

1080
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,500
OK.

1081
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:41,500
OK, OK, OK.

1082
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:50,200
- Save us
- Melman

1083
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:52,000
- We love you
- Melman

1084
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:53,100
Save us

1085
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,600
OK, here we go. OK, OK.

1086
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:57,700
- Melman
- We love you

1087
01:06:57,700 --> 01:06:59,300
- Melman
- Save us

1088
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:02,100
Here we go! Here we go!

1089
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:05,100
- What's all the hoopla about?
- Joe?

1090
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,900
Joe the Witch Doctor?
We thought you were dead!

1091
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:11,600
So did I. Then I realized
I'm covered in brown spots.

1092
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:14,700
So Melman's not dying!

1093
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:17,900
- Melman's not dying!
- Oh, no!

1094
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:19,200
Melman!

1095
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:20,800
Move!

1096
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:24,800
Don't do this! Julien,
stop this! This is crazy!

1097
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:29,800
Oh, suddenly throwing a giraffe
into a volcano to make water is crazy!

1098
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:30,800
Yes!

1099
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:37,400
- Please, Melman! Stop!
- Gloria?

1100
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:39,500
- You can't do this!
- Why not?

1101
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:41,100
Because...

1102
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:02,000
You can't do this, Melman.

1103
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:03,900
First, that hurts.

1104
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:07,300
Second, I've only got
18 hours to live, anyway.

1105
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,900
Melman, I gotta know...

1106
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:13,600
...did you mean those things
you said about me?

1107
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:16,000
Of course I did.

1108
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:18,400
- That's crazy.
- It is?

1109
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:25,100
It's crazy to think I had to go
halfway around the world...

1110
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:28,400
...to find out the perfect guy for me

1111
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:30,400
lived right next door.

1112
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:33,800
Then it's you and me, neighbor.

1113
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,700
You and me for the next 18 hours.

1114
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,100
I'll take whatever you got.

1115
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:46,700
- Maurice, what happened?
- I believe the fat lady has sung.

1116
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:49,600
- What's going on here?
- Marty!

1117
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:53,600
Alex is in big trouble!
We got to get upriver fast!

1118
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:56,100
- What about the plane?
- Perfect! Come on!

1119
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:02,700
The plane won't be fixed
until the suits meet our demands.

1120
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,500
Now, maternity leave.

1121
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:08,000
Maternity leave? You're all males.

1122
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:10,600
We need that plane for a rescue mission.

1123
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:13,600
There's nothing I can do
until we bust up this union.

1124
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:17,100
I'll bust up all of you
if you don't get this plane going.

1125
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:21,500
Can't you see these commies have
my hands tied? No maternity leave.

1126
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Maybe a certain someone wouldn't want
these blowing around on the savanna.

1127
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:40,800
All right. You get your maternity leave.

1128
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:43,600
Finally.

1129
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:51,500
Where we headed?
What's going on? Where are we going?

1130
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:55,200
Oh, no! Please! Don't put me there! No!

1131
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,200
This is wrong.

1132
01:09:57,300 --> 01:10:00,900
You see? You are survivors.

1133
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:04,700
Now, how about a nice lion casserole?

1134
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:06,700
You can't eat a lion.

1135
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,700
Don't worry, it tastes like chicken.

1136
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,100
No, no, no. Don't listen to her.

1137
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:14,100
She's out of her mind, people!

1138
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:17,900
I'm from New York City!

1139
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:20,700
It's me, Alex the lion!
From Central Park!

1140
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:29,300
Dad!

1141
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:34,400
What were you thinking, son?
You got no business being out here!

1142
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,300
Stay behind me.

1143
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:41,500
They're New Yorkers.
They're just rude and frightened people.

1144
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:43,100
Stay back!

1145
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:45,400
You'd let your dinner get away?

1146
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:55,100
- What are you doing?
- The only thing I know how to do.

1147
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:00,400
What the heck?

1148
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:07,800
Hey, I know those moves.

1149
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:09,300
Alex?

1150
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,000
- It's Alex the lion!
- From Central Park!

1151
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:16,800
It is Alex!

1152
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,500
Only one lion can move like that!

1153
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:26,200
He's beautiful.

1154
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:27,400
I can't believe it.

1155
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:36,300
How does he do that?

1156
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:50,400
What are you doing?

1157
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:53,400
I'm dancing with my son! I think.

1158
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:55,200
Don't think, Dad. Feel!

1159
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:57,900
Butterfly!

1160
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:02,400
I'm feeling it! I'm feeling it!

1161
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:16,200
Roar!

1162
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:29,200
That was beautiful. Now let's eat!

1163
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:30,800
Dad, look out!

1164
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:34,100
What the...

1165
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:35,900
Alex! Get in!

1166
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:39,700
She's got a gun! Get out while we can!

1167
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,600
- What?
- She's got a gun!

1168
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:44,100
Get out while we can! Pass it on!

1169
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:52,200
He said let's have some fun
and take out the dam. Basset hound.

1170
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:55,600
Skipper! Alex wants to take out the dam.

1171
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:58,200
All right! But it's his funeral.

1172
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:02,100
- Hard to port!
- Aye-aye, Skippy!

1173
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:04,900
Bring it on! Bring it on!

1174
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:13,600
Come back! That's my dinner!

1175
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:15,500
Kowalski, full throttle.

1176
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:19,100
Music!

1177
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:22,700
- I like this song.
- It never gets old.

1178
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:26,800
It does have a catchy hook.
Come about! Bring her in low!

1179
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:31,100
Hold onto your skirts!
It's dam-busting time!

1180
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:35,500
Hold on tight, baby! Here we go!

1181
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:39,300
Tell them no! Pull up! They'll kill us!

1182
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:42,500
There's got to be another way!
Pass it on!

1183
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:50,000
They say no pull up. Kill us.
There's no other way. Basset hound.

1184
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:51,500
Are you sure?

1185
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:56,300
Men, there is no sacrifice greater
than someone else's.

1186
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,000
No! Medic!

1187
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:03,800
Ramming speed!

1188
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:09,700
Bring it on!

1189
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,800
Bad kitties.

1190
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:24,500
I don't know
why the sacrifice didn't work.

1191
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:27,200
The science seemed so solid.

1192
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:32,300
I'd jump right in that volcano
if I wasn't so good at whistling.

1193
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
It's you! I found you!

1194
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:45,300
Mort?

1195
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,700
Bad fishy!

1196
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:01,600
I wonder if the gods like seafood.

1197
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:03,500
Let's find out.

1198
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,400
Look, Maurice.

1199
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,500
- That was quick.
- I did it!

1200
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:13,400
I did it! I did it!

1201
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:15,700
OK, you did it!

1202
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,700
Oh, yes!!

1203
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:44,800
Look!

1204
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:47,300
- It's Alakay!
- It's Zuba!

1205
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:49,800
You did it!

1206
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:52,300
Alakay, Zuba, you did it!

1207
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:00,600
Zuba! Alakay!

1208
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:02,200
You're back!

1209
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
I'm so glad you're safe!

1210
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:08,600
Out of my way.

1211
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:11,600
Well, well, well.

1212
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:17,100
You know, Zuba, if I remember correctly,
you quit the pride.

1213
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:19,300
And you were kicked out.

1214
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:23,300
So don't think that this
changes anything.

1215
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:28,400
You're right. In fact, we humbly present
you with this token of appreciation.

1216
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:30,900
A man bag. Very popular where I'm from.

1217
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,300
- Don't know what to say.
- Still be tough and carry your stuff.

1218
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:38,600
Does the strap adjust? This will go
very nicely for me when I go out hiking.

1219
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,800
But you're still banished.

1220
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,800
We figured you'd say that.

1221
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,100
My handbag!

1222
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:49,400
You bad kitty!

1223
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:54,800
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1224
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:07,400
You deserve this, son.

1225
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:10,700
Welcome to the pride.

1226
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:18,200
Thanks, Dad. But this belongs to you.

1227
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:21,000
No, son. To us!

1228
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:30,400
My son! The King of New York!

1229
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
That's my baby!

1230
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:44,400
Love transcends all differences.

1231
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:49,400
We are gathered here today
to celebrate such a love.

1232
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:53,500
Do you take each other,
for better or for worse?

1233
01:17:57,100 --> 01:17:58,300
For better, please.

1234
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:02,200
What a beautiful, weird couple!

1235
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:04,400
That's not going to last.

1236
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,500
Can I kiss the bride?

1237
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:09,400
No! Music!

1238
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:11,200
- Struts.
- Check.

1239
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:12,600
- Flaps!
- Check.

1240
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,600
- Diamonds and gold.
- Check.

1241
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:18,700
- Bye-bye!
- We'll miss you!

1242
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,000
See you later!

1243
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:23,000
We'll be back after the honeymoon
in Monte Carlo,

1244
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:24,900
or whenever the gold runs out.

1245
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:26,300
Come back soon!

1246
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:31,500
Mom, let them take their time. New York
isn't going anywhere, right, guys?

1247
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,600
You're right about that!

1248
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:35,600
As long as I'm with her...

1249
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:39,500
...and you two, I don't care
where we are.

1250
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:42,300
She has the most amazing laugh.

1251
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:47,400
Love has no boundaries!

1252
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:50,700
Looks like you're stuck
with us for a while.

1253
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:56,200
Dad? What's wrong?

1254
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:58,900
I just thought we
could hang out a bit and...

1255
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:03,500
- You got me!
- I got you, son!

1256
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:07,200
You got me with my thing.
You brought it back around on me.

1257
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:11,800
I got you, son!

1258
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,700
The old man's not too bad, eh, Marty?

1259
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:17,200
- Marty? Who's Marty?
- Come on.

1260
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:20,600
- I don't know no Marty.
- You can't fool me.

1261
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:22,800
Ain't no Marty here.

1262
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:27,300
Marty! I can look into your eyes,
and I know it's you.

1263
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:30,700
See, I've been traveling
Been traveling forever

1264
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:34,000
But now that I found a home
feels like I'm in heaven

1265
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:37,300
See, I've been traveling
Been traveling forever

1266
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:39,300
But now that I'm home

1267
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:43,000
Hey! Shake the hot things!
Shake the hot things!

1268
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:46,700
Shake 'em! Shake 'em! Shake 'em!
