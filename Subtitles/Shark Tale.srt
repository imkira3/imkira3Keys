Hey. What are you doing here?

1316
00:51:58,699 --> 00:52:00,281
What, Oscar, did you
forget something?

1317

- Oh, stop it.

1324
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:17,382
Your pet shark told me
everything.

1325
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:18,468
Dang, Lenny.

1326
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:19,963
Why would you do that?

1327
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:22,303
I don't know.
I like her.

bringing him in here?

1330
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:29,056
I'm still working
out the kinks.

1331
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:31,479
"Kinks?" You lied.

1332
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:33,682
Everybody thinks you
"slayed" the shark.

1333
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:35,433
Who am I to tell them that
they're wrong?

1334
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:37,814
How could you
lie to me, Oscar? Me!

1335
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:40,238
Don't take it personally.
I lied to everybody.

1336
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:44,735
All right, I'm sorry.
I totally betrayed you.

1337

I got just one little problem
I got to take care of.

1340
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:55,290
And they should!
What did you expect?

1341
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:57,247
You take credit
for killing a shark,

1342
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:58,693
and then everything
will be fine and dandy

1343
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:00,128

Lenny got it. We gonna fix it.

and you go home.

We gonna paint you up
all bloody. A mess, right?

1357
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:34,542
Then you'll swim out
and meet the sharks

before they get here.

1359
