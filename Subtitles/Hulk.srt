There's simply no way to shield
against every weaponized agent.

3
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:26,200
Instead, I can make
super-immune systems...

4
00:04:26,283 --> 00:04:28,953
by strengthening
the human cellular response.

5
00:04:28,994 --> 00:04:30,955
Banner, I know
where you're going.

6
00:04:30,996 --> 00:04:33,207
But manipulating the immune system
is dangerous and stupid.

7
00:04:33,249 --> 00:04:37,211
The president's science advisors
made it absolutely clear...

8
00:04:37,294 --> 00:04:40,297
no human subjects.

9
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,404
David, I have wonderful news.

10
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,576
I'm gonna have a baby.

11
00:06:49,506 --> 00:06:53,343
What's it gonna be?  Whoa, look at that,
Bruce. Huh?  Want a dinosaur?

12
00:06:53,427 --> 00:06:55,929
Let's have a little fight.

13
00:06:56,013 --> 00:06:58,348
You don't scare me.

14
00:07:00,434 --> 00:07:03,645
That's a delicious eyeball.  Ooh, you're big
and green and scary.  I'm gonna run away.

15
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:32,840
Really, speaking of Cheryl,
guess what...

16
00:07:32,923 --> 00:07:34,884
Bruce, you're hurt!

17
00:07:36,093 --> 00:07:39,138
Jack hit him with the stick,
but Bruce wouldn't hit him back.

18
00:07:39,221 --> 00:07:41,724
He just stood there, shaking.

19
00:07:41,807 --> 00:07:43,809
It's okay.

20
00:07:50,858 --> 00:07:52,777
Yeah, strange
he didn't make a peep.

21
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,321
Any other kid
would've wailed his head off.

22
00:07:55,404 --> 00:07:56,989
That's Bruce. He's like that.

23
00:07:57,031 --> 00:07:59,658
He's just so... bottled up.

24
00:08:03,912 --> 00:08:06,873
The samples we found in your lab...
they were human blood.

25
00:08:06,915 --> 00:08:08,875
You've ignored protocol.

26
00:08:08,917 --> 00:08:11,669
You had no right
snooping around in my lab.

27
00:08:11,795 --> 00:08:13,713
That's my business.

28
00:08:13,838 --> 00:08:17,759
Wrong, Banner.  It's government business,
and you're off the project.

29
00:08:39,823 --> 00:08:42,700
Attention, all personnel.
Fail-safe has been initiated.

30
00:08:42,741 --> 00:08:45,411
Gamma decontamination
will occur in 30 minutes!

31
00:08:45,494 --> 00:08:47,162
Evacuate immediately!

32
00:08:47,246 --> 00:08:49,540
I repeat, evacuate immediately!

33
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:11,770
- Edith?
- David, what's going on?

34
00:09:11,854 --> 00:09:15,024
- I gotta talk to you, Edith.
- Bruce, stay here.

35
00:09:17,151 --> 00:09:19,111
What are you doing?

36
00:09:52,226 --> 00:09:54,145
What are you doing?

37
00:09:54,228 --> 00:09:57,148
I'm trying to tell you
what has to be done!

38
00:09:57,231 --> 00:09:59,692
David, please stop it!
No!

39
00:10:04,863 --> 00:10:06,865
No! No!
Yes!

40
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:09,368
David! No!

41
00:10:15,957 --> 00:10:18,335
Bruce.

42
00:10:18,377 --> 00:10:20,379
Bruce, wake up, son.

43
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:23,423
Bruce. Bruce.

44
00:10:26,718 --> 00:10:29,262
Another nightmare?

45
00:10:29,346 --> 00:10:31,807
I don't know.

46
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:33,975
I don't remember.

47
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,521
Hi, Mom.

48
00:10:38,897 --> 00:10:41,857
Already off to college.

49
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:43,859
Gonna miss you terribly.

50
00:10:43,901 --> 00:10:45,861
I'll miss you too.

51
00:10:45,903 --> 00:10:47,947
Please, come here.

52
00:10:49,407 --> 00:10:51,867
Look at you.

53
00:10:51,992 --> 00:10:55,037
Soon to be a great scientist.

54
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:56,914
I guess.

55
00:10:56,997 --> 00:10:58,958
- I mean, who knows?
- I do.

56
00:10:58,999 --> 00:11:03,212
There's something inside you...
so special.

57
00:11:04,255 --> 00:11:06,215
Some kind of greatness.

58
00:11:06,257 --> 00:11:08,384
I'm sure someday you're gonna...

59
00:11:08,426 --> 00:11:10,845
share it with the whole world.

60
00:12:05,356 --> 00:12:08,609
But as far as I'm concerned,
security oughta be...

61
00:12:09,026 --> 00:12:10,611
Good morning, Dr. Krenzler.

62
00:12:10,736 --> 00:12:14,573
Security oughta be beefed up.  In a
place like this you can't be too careful

63
00:12:14,656 --> 00:12:16,909
Bruce!  Big day.

64
00:12:16,992 --> 00:12:19,953
- Did you sleep?  I didn't sleep.
- I slept okay.

65
00:12:20,037 --> 00:12:22,414
- Is Betty here?
- She's around.

66
00:12:22,498 --> 00:12:25,626
I really gotta say, seeing you
in that stylin' head wear...

67
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:28,921
You're implying something
about my helmet?

68
00:12:29,046 --> 00:12:32,007
You look like a massive nerd,
even around other scientists.

69
00:12:32,132 --> 00:12:36,345
Can I just ask... Were you wearing
the helmet while she dumped you?

70
00:12:36,345 --> 00:12:38,847
See, it protects my very
important brain, Harper.

71
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:41,016
Go prep the samples.

72
00:12:42,016 --> 00:12:45,478
- Hey. I found you.
- Betty, hey.

73
00:12:48,815 --> 00:12:50,942
I hate them.

74
00:12:51,025 --> 00:12:53,319
-Wait, I just got here.  Who do we hate?
-The review board.

75
00:12:53,403 --> 00:12:56,322
We have to make a
presentation on Tuesday.

76
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,491
And you're gonna make it with me.

77
00:12:58,533 --> 00:13:00,702
You think I should?

78
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,246
Yeah, you're great with that stuff.

79
00:13:03,246 --> 00:13:08,459
You start talking about microbes and
nanomeds, you sound almost... passionate

80
00:13:10,628 --> 00:13:13,047
I'm sorry.

81
00:13:13,089 --> 00:13:15,174
That was rude.

82
00:13:15,258 --> 00:13:17,719
Look, nobody expects this
to be easy,

83
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,014
us working together
after being... so close.

84
00:13:21,055 --> 00:13:23,015
We were close?

85
00:13:23,056 --> 00:13:25,434
Look, if I could be more...

86
00:13:27,394 --> 00:13:29,354
whatever, you know...

87
00:13:29,396 --> 00:13:31,606
- I'm... just...
- Don't.

88
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:34,067
It's not your fault, really.

89
00:13:34,151 --> 00:13:36,069
You're just a by-product...

90
00:13:36,153 --> 00:13:39,114
of my inexplicable obsession
with emotionally distant men.

91
00:13:39,156 --> 00:13:41,199
I'll get over us.

92
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,202
Good for you.

93
00:13:44,244 --> 00:13:47,205
Anyway, I'm just really stressed
about this review.

94
00:13:47,289 --> 00:13:51,418
If we don't get impressive results today,
we're gonna have a really hard sell come Tuesday.

95
00:13:52,794 --> 00:13:54,755
Well, then, let's go be impressive.

96
00:14:38,673 --> 00:14:40,633
Harper?

97
00:14:40,675 --> 00:14:43,551
Ready when you are.
Let's hit it.

98
00:14:48,473 --> 00:14:50,266
Are we passing inspection?

99
00:14:50,392 --> 00:14:52,769
Safeties all going green.

100
00:14:52,811 --> 00:14:54,813
Countdown's started.

101
00:14:57,732 --> 00:14:59,943
Nanomeds released.

102
00:15:02,028 --> 00:15:03,988
Four seconds.

103
00:15:07,158 --> 00:15:09,828
Okay, nanomeds fully dispersed.

104
00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:15,166
Okay, let's hit Freddie
with the gamma radiation.

105
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,180
Gamma exposure.

106
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:33,976
Nanomeds now active.

107
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:40,941
Nanomeds replicating cells on border.

108
00:15:41,025 --> 00:15:42,985
It's working.

109
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:50,367
Cell copy to disassemble ratio
holding within one percent.

110
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,377
Imbalanced nanomed activity.

111
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:15,141
You wanna go to the review board
on Monday and tell 'em...

112
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:18,186
we've developed a brand-new
method for exploding frogs?

113
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:21,522
Yeah, I think maybe
there's a market for it.

114
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,900
I mean, what if there's a plague?

115
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,652
What have you had, Betty,
like, one beer?

116
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:29,697
I'm just sa...
I'm just saying, you know,

117
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,200
frogs start falling from the sky,

118
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,577
who do they come to?

119
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,621
We'd be world-renowned.

120
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,873
Make any parents proud.

121
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,000
I bet they would be.

122
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:45,045
They actually did
want me to be a scientist.

123
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,215
I mean, your birth parents.

124
00:16:49,966 --> 00:16:51,927
Guess we'll never know.

125
00:16:54,971 --> 00:16:57,933
I don't understand why you don't
want to find out about them.

126
00:16:57,974 --> 00:17:01,436
They're dead.  They died before
I can remember anything.

127
00:17:01,436 --> 00:17:04,356
Why do you always
come back to this?

128
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:06,692
Don't know.

129
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:10,112
I guess I figure there's more
to you than you like to show.

130
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,240
I guess there couldn't be any less

131
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:17,452
Right. So now we come
full circle back to that.

132
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,496
Nice work, Betty.

133
00:17:32,842 --> 00:17:34,844
Betty.

134
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,596
- Glen.
- Hey.

135
00:17:37,638 --> 00:17:39,640
Hi.

136
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,767
Hi.

137
00:17:43,144 --> 00:17:45,354
What happened
to your uniform?

138
00:17:45,354 --> 00:17:47,606
Oh, I, uh...
I switched over.

139
00:17:47,648 --> 00:17:50,109
I'm still working with your father, but...

140
00:17:50,151 --> 00:17:53,779
Well, you know, the military's subcontracting
out all the most interesting work, and...

141
00:17:55,322 --> 00:17:57,325
Can't argue with a paycheck.

142
00:17:57,408 --> 00:18:00,328
I basically run
all the labs on the base now.

143
00:18:00,411 --> 00:18:02,329
Oh.

144
00:18:03,955 --> 00:18:06,124
Hey, you're uh...

145
00:18:06,249 --> 00:18:08,209
you're looking good.

146
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:16,468
You're the genetics expert.

147
00:18:27,896 --> 00:18:30,607
Ah, the good old college days.

148
00:18:32,025 --> 00:18:34,027
So, how's business?

149
00:18:36,029 --> 00:18:37,989
What do you want?

150
00:18:39,616 --> 00:18:42,534
All right, I'll cut to the chase.

151
00:18:42,618 --> 00:18:45,537
I've been hearing interesting things
about what you guys are doing here

152
00:18:45,621 --> 00:18:49,500
Your little molecular machines
have some incredible implications.

153
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,544
How would you like to
come work for Atheon?

154
00:18:52,628 --> 00:18:55,547
Get paid 10 times as much
as you earn now...

155
00:18:55,631 --> 00:18:58,342
and own a piece of the patents.

156
00:19:00,177 --> 00:19:02,137
You just have to say the word.

157
00:19:02,221 --> 00:19:04,223
Two words: The door.

158
00:19:23,491 --> 00:19:25,410
General?

159
00:19:25,493 --> 00:19:27,620
Come in.

160
00:19:28,705 --> 00:19:31,332
Talbot wanted you to see this, sir.

161
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:35,378
It's about a lab Atheon is targeting for
acquisition and removal to desert base

162
00:19:36,629 --> 00:19:38,798
Why isn't it
going through N.S.C.?

163
00:19:40,633 --> 00:19:44,220
It, uh, concerns
your daughter, sir.

164
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,480
Hi. Sorry.

165
00:19:56,149 --> 00:20:00,361
Hey, what happened to Benny?  Is he
not working the night shift anymore?

166
00:20:00,445 --> 00:20:02,404
Benny's dead.

167
00:20:02,446 --> 00:20:04,740
I'm the new guy.

168
00:20:04,823 --> 00:20:06,825
Oh.

169
00:20:08,327 --> 00:20:10,454
Good to meet you.
Same.

170
00:20:34,686 --> 00:20:36,897
- Let's try another.

171
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,775
Mmm, no. Stay here.

172
00:20:39,816 --> 00:20:41,942
I look tired anyway.

173
00:20:42,026 --> 00:20:44,195
Yeah, but you look great.

174
00:20:46,864 --> 00:20:48,824
What's the matter?

175
00:20:48,866 --> 00:20:51,410
It's these dreams, Doctor.

176
00:20:51,535 --> 00:20:54,789
I keep having them,
and they're terrible.

177
00:20:56,165 --> 00:20:58,542
Tell me about your dream.

178
00:21:01,295 --> 00:21:03,631
Well, it starts...

179
00:21:03,756 --> 00:21:07,009
it starts with a memory...
I think it's my first memory.

180
00:21:07,093 --> 00:21:10,096
It's this image I have...

181
00:21:10,179 --> 00:21:12,973
from when I was
maybe two years old.

182
00:21:44,713 --> 00:21:47,132
Do you think
it's just a dream?

183
00:21:47,215 --> 00:21:49,467
No, I think it's something
that happened...

184
00:21:49,551 --> 00:21:52,554
when I was living at a desert base
with my father.

185
00:21:53,555 --> 00:21:55,557
Anyhow,

186
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,101
the dream goes on and...

187
00:21:58,143 --> 00:22:00,020
suddenly I'm alone.

188
00:22:35,471 --> 00:22:37,431
That's terrible.

189
00:22:37,514 --> 00:22:39,933
You know I'd never hurt you.

190
00:23:15,468 --> 00:23:17,470
Hey there.

191
00:23:17,512 --> 00:23:20,598
What's your name, darlin'?

192
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:23,475
Eh? What's your name?

193
00:23:24,226 --> 00:23:26,687
Okay.

194
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,772
It's okay.

195
00:25:19,297 --> 00:25:21,257
I gotta talk to you, Edith.

196
00:25:21,341 --> 00:25:23,425
Bruce, stay here!

197
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:46,673
"C... T... G...

198
00:26:46,757 --> 00:26:49,968
A... G."

199
00:26:52,179 --> 00:26:54,139
Bruce.

200
00:27:00,354 --> 00:27:02,272
My Bruce.

201
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,201
Good morning.
Glen dropped by.

202
00:27:14,242 --> 00:27:16,203
What's he doing here?

203
00:27:16,244 --> 00:27:17,954
You know, Dr. Krenzler,

204
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:20,999
you and I have never had the chance
to get to know each other properly.

205
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:25,086
Well, that's because I don't want to get
to know you, properly or improperly.

206
00:27:27,213 --> 00:27:29,131
So leave.

207
00:27:29,215 --> 00:27:31,175
Hey, no worries.

208
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,727
Let me give you a little heads-up.

209
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:45,231
There is a hairsbreadth
between friendly offer...

210
00:27:45,314 --> 00:27:47,191
and hostile takeover.

211
00:27:47,316 --> 00:27:51,237
I've done my homework.  The work
you're doing here is dynamite.

212
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,240
Think: Gls embedded with technology...

213
00:27:54,281 --> 00:27:56,784
that makes them instantly
repairable on the battlefield...

214
00:27:56,867 --> 00:27:58,995
in our sole possession.

215
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:02,539
That's a hell of a business.

216
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:06,459
Well, it's not what we're doing here.
We're doing the basic science for everyone

217
00:28:08,712 --> 00:28:11,047
You know, someday
I'm gonna write a book...

218
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:16,094
and I'm gonna call it When Stupid Ideals
Happen To Smart, Penniless Scientists.

219
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:20,223
In the meantime, Bruce,
you will be hearing from me.

220
00:28:42,745 --> 00:28:44,747
About Glen, I, um...

221
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:47,499
There's nothing to talk about.

222
00:28:49,793 --> 00:28:51,795
Okay.

223
00:28:51,837 --> 00:28:55,841
I just wanted to say, don't worry
about him... I'll handle it.

224
00:28:58,302 --> 00:29:00,262
How?

225
00:29:01,347 --> 00:29:03,390
I'm gonna call my father,

226
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,518
ask him to exert some pressure.

227
00:29:06,602 --> 00:29:09,938
Last I heard, you and your father
weren't speaking.

228
00:29:09,938 --> 00:29:11,940
Hmm.

229
00:29:11,982 --> 00:29:13,942
Well...

230
00:29:13,984 --> 00:29:16,654
I guess now I have something
to talk with him about.

231
00:29:17,154 --> 00:29:19,073
I think this circuit's kinda fried.

232
00:29:19,156 --> 00:29:22,034
I don't know.  Maybe you
anna come take a look at it

233
00:29:22,076 --> 00:29:24,410
Okay, I'll be right there.

234
00:29:31,709 --> 00:29:33,961
Aah!

235
00:29:50,395 --> 00:29:54,315
The gamma's too high!
Bruce, I can't stop it!

236
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:59,028
Harper, get out!

237
00:29:59,028 --> 00:30:01,781
Get out!

238
00:30:27,556 --> 00:30:29,474
How's Harper?

239
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:31,476
He's all right.

240
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,478
You saved him.

241
00:30:33,562 --> 00:30:37,524
I don't think he's coming back
to the lab for a while, though.

242
00:30:42,778 --> 00:30:45,323
I don't understand
how this is possible.

243
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:48,284
You should be dead.

244
00:30:50,411 --> 00:30:53,998
They worked... the nanomeds.

245
00:30:54,081 --> 00:30:56,083
I mean, I feel great.

246
00:30:56,125 --> 00:30:59,670
I feel like... I don't know.
They must have, like, fixed me.

247
00:30:59,712 --> 00:31:03,257
Bruce, they've killed everything else
that they've come into contact with.

248
00:31:05,635 --> 00:31:07,595
Are you sure
the doctor checked?

249
00:31:07,637 --> 00:31:09,597
The doctor gave me
the full workup.

250
00:31:09,597 --> 00:31:11,891
He wants to know where
he can get what I'm taking.

251
00:31:11,974 --> 00:31:13,934
I'm a hundred percent.

252
00:31:14,977 --> 00:31:16,979
More.

253
00:31:17,063 --> 00:31:19,357
What do you mean?

254
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,359
Remember my bad knee?

255
00:31:21,442 --> 00:31:23,777
Well, now it's my good knee.

256
00:31:23,818 --> 00:31:26,363
Bruce, this isn't funny.

257
00:31:26,446 --> 00:31:28,448
I was watching you.

258
00:31:29,616 --> 00:31:33,995
You were gonna die,
and I was gonna have to watch you die.

259
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:36,706
Betty...

260
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,833
I'm sorry.

261
00:31:40,502 --> 00:31:43,088
Really.

262
00:31:43,171 --> 00:31:45,757
Hey, I'm not gonna explode.
Okay?

263
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:48,760
Yeah.

264
00:31:48,802 --> 00:31:51,930
You should get some rest.

265
00:31:52,013 --> 00:31:54,015
And I'm fine. Really.

266
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:57,352
I've never felt better.

267
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:02,915
Your name is not Krenzler.

268
00:33:03,082 --> 00:33:05,293
It's Banner.

269
00:33:08,588 --> 00:33:10,632
- What?
- Your name...

270
00:33:10,632 --> 00:33:12,425
it's Banner.

271
00:33:12,717 --> 00:33:14,177
Bruce Banner.

272
00:33:14,927 --> 00:33:17,138
Bruce.

273
00:33:18,723 --> 00:33:21,392
How did you get in here?
I work here now.

274
00:33:21,476 --> 00:33:24,227
In the labs.
The late shift.

275
00:33:25,395 --> 00:33:28,231
It keeps me close to you.

276
00:33:28,315 --> 00:33:32,653
You always work so late yourself
with your friend Miss Ross.

277
00:33:32,736 --> 00:33:36,031
No, no. Please. Please.
Let me.

278
00:33:39,618 --> 00:33:41,745
You're not well.

279
00:33:41,912 --> 00:33:44,581
You've had a terrible accident.

280
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:49,711
You're wondering
why you're still alive.

281
00:33:51,922 --> 00:33:54,925
You're thinking
there's something inside.

282
00:33:55,926 --> 00:33:58,387
Something different...

283
00:34:00,263 --> 00:34:02,140
inexplicable.

284
00:34:03,683 --> 00:34:06,602
I can help you understand,

285
00:34:06,686 --> 00:34:08,688
if you'll let me.

286
00:34:10,356 --> 00:34:12,358
If you'll...

287
00:34:13,442 --> 00:34:15,403
forgive me.

288
00:34:19,281 --> 00:34:24,120
Look, mister, I'm sure I have
nothing to forgive you for.

289
00:34:25,579 --> 00:34:27,540
So perhaps you should leave now.

290
00:34:27,623 --> 00:34:29,542
I'll be fine.

291
00:34:29,625 --> 00:34:31,544
You must know.

292
00:34:31,627 --> 00:34:33,879
You may not want to believe it,

293
00:34:33,963 --> 00:34:37,591
but I can see it in your eyes.

294
00:34:38,801 --> 00:34:41,304
So much like your mother's.

295
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:45,140
Of course,
you're my flesh and blood.

296
00:34:45,223 --> 00:34:49,311
But then, you're something else too,
aren't you?

297
00:34:49,394 --> 00:34:51,646
My physical son,

298
00:34:52,647 --> 00:34:55,317
but the child of my mind too.

299
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,319
No.

300
00:34:57,402 --> 00:34:59,279
You're lying.

301
00:34:59,404 --> 00:35:02,282
My parents died
when I was a small boy.

302
00:35:02,324 --> 00:35:05,827
No, no, that's not true.
That's what they wanted you to believe.

303
00:35:05,869 --> 00:35:09,122
The experiments, the accident...
all top secret.

304
00:35:09,164 --> 00:35:12,250
They put me away for 30 years.

305
00:35:12,334 --> 00:35:14,753
Thirty years!

306
00:35:15,795 --> 00:35:17,964
Away from you.

307
00:35:18,048 --> 00:35:20,008
Away from our work.

308
00:35:21,217 --> 00:35:23,177
But they couldn't keep me forever.

309
00:35:23,177 --> 00:35:25,971
After all, I'm sane.
They had to admit it.

310
00:35:27,556 --> 00:35:30,225
You see,

311
00:35:30,309 --> 00:35:32,269
everything...

312
00:35:32,353 --> 00:35:34,647
your extraordinary mind...

313
00:35:34,688 --> 00:35:37,691
has been seeking all these years...

314
00:35:37,775 --> 00:35:40,277
it's been inside you.

315
00:35:41,278 --> 00:35:43,530
Now we will understand it.

316
00:35:43,614 --> 00:35:46,033
We will harness it.

317
00:35:48,118 --> 00:35:50,371
No, don't answer it.
It's Miss Ross again.

318
00:35:50,454 --> 00:35:54,875
There's something you need to know
about her, Bruce. Something troublesome

319
00:35:54,917 --> 00:35:57,544
Let me protect you from her.

320
00:35:57,628 --> 00:36:00,172
No. Get out.

321
00:36:00,255 --> 00:36:02,632
- Bruce...
- Get out!

322
00:36:03,341 --> 00:36:04,634
Sit!

323
00:36:22,151 --> 00:36:25,363
We're gonna have to
watch that temper of yours.

324
00:37:04,901 --> 00:37:06,778
You sure you're okay?

325
00:37:06,903 --> 00:37:08,822
Yeah, just glad to be out of bed

326
00:37:10,073 --> 00:37:12,659
Got a message from my father.

327
00:37:12,743 --> 00:37:14,661
He's coming to see me.

328
00:37:14,745 --> 00:37:16,663
Your father?

329
00:37:16,747 --> 00:37:18,415
When?

330
00:37:18,415 --> 00:37:20,459
Lands in about an hour.

331
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:24,420
The funny thing is, he called me.

332
00:37:35,264 --> 00:37:38,392
- Hi, Dad.
- Hello, Betty.

333
00:37:48,194 --> 00:37:50,071
- Here, ma'am.
- Thanks.

334
00:37:50,154 --> 00:37:51,572
- You're welcome.  Sir?
- Thank you.

335
00:37:51,656 --> 00:37:53,032
You're welcome.

336
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:05,168
Look, I'm gonna get right to it.

337
00:38:05,251 --> 00:38:07,337
It's about Glen, isn't it?

338
00:38:08,797 --> 00:38:11,758
He's been snooping around my lab.

339
00:38:11,841 --> 00:38:13,760
Glen noticed some things,

340
00:38:13,843 --> 00:38:16,680
asked me to make some inquiries.

341
00:38:18,431 --> 00:38:20,266
Are you here to...

342
00:38:20,433 --> 00:38:22,352
question me?

343
00:38:22,477 --> 00:38:23,937
No.

344
00:38:23,979 --> 00:38:26,815
We've turned up
some surprising things.

345
00:38:29,317 --> 00:38:31,653
This Krenzler you work with...

346
00:38:31,736 --> 00:38:34,280
you know who he really is?

347
00:38:36,241 --> 00:38:38,368
How much do you
actually know about him?

348
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:41,371
I think the question is,

349
00:38:41,371 --> 00:38:44,206
what is it
that you know about him?

350
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:51,463
- Well, right now, I'm not...
- Not at liberty to disclose it to me. Right

351
00:38:52,715 --> 00:38:54,675
You know,

352
00:38:54,717 --> 00:38:57,761
I think I was hoping that...

353
00:38:57,761 --> 00:39:00,514
maybe this time you just...

354
00:39:00,556 --> 00:39:03,976
honestly wanted to see me again.

355
00:39:04,018 --> 00:39:06,645
- You've got this all wrong, Betty.
- Do I?

356
00:39:06,729 --> 00:39:10,649
Yes. I do want to see you.

357
00:39:12,985 --> 00:39:16,113
I really wishthat I
could believe you.

358
00:40:03,617 --> 00:40:05,661
Everything...

359
00:40:05,786 --> 00:40:09,206
your extraordinary mind
has been seeking...

360
00:40:09,289 --> 00:40:11,625
all these years,

361
00:40:11,708 --> 00:40:14,378
it's been inside you.

362
00:40:33,063 --> 00:40:35,232
Hi, you've called Dr. Krenzler.

363
00:40:35,315 --> 00:40:38,318
Please leave a message
and I'll call you right back.

364
00:40:39,695 --> 00:40:43,322
Bruce, hey. Are you there?

365
00:40:43,406 --> 00:40:45,825
Look, um,
I think I screwed up.

366
00:40:45,866 --> 00:40:50,496
My father... It's like he suspects
you of something. I don't know.

367
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:53,666
- I was so impatient, like always.

368
00:40:53,749 --> 00:40:56,627
I didn't hear him out.
I don't know, I...

369
00:40:56,669 --> 00:41:00,131
I just think that they're planning
something with the lab.

370
00:41:00,214 --> 00:41:01,924
So, um, uh...

371
00:41:02,008 --> 00:41:03,843
Call me. Okay?

372
00:41:03,926 --> 00:41:05,761
Bye.

373
00:41:07,763 --> 00:41:08,931
- Betty?

374
00:42:46,067 --> 00:42:48,987
Dispatch! Dispatch!
We have a 415 at the lab!

375
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:51,406
Send Berkeley P.D. Now!
Send 'em now!

376
00:43:18,766 --> 00:43:20,727
Watch out!

377
00:44:25,665 --> 00:44:28,000
Edith?

378
00:44:28,042 --> 00:44:30,002
David, what's going on?

379
00:44:30,044 --> 00:44:33,255
- I gotta talk to you, Edith.
- Bruce, stay here.

380
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:07,622
My Bruce.

381
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:23,762
Bruce?

382
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,593
There was some sort of explosion.

383
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:05,136
They wouldn't let us
into the building.

384
00:46:06,512 --> 00:46:08,973
I was worried about you.

385
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:11,517
Well, I'm okay.

386
00:46:13,436 --> 00:46:15,396
What happened to you last night?

387
00:46:17,023 --> 00:46:19,442
I had the most vivid dream.

388
00:46:20,735 --> 00:46:23,655
It was like being born.

389
00:46:23,738 --> 00:46:26,449
Coming up for air.
Light hitting my face.

390
00:46:26,532 --> 00:46:28,534
Screaming.

391
00:46:29,535 --> 00:46:31,955
My heartbeat...

392
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,582
it was, like, boom...

393
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,626
boom...

394
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,422
boom.

395
00:46:46,635 --> 00:46:48,595
Were you at the lab?

396
00:46:48,637 --> 00:46:50,639
No.

397
00:46:51,974 --> 00:46:53,976
But something...

398
00:46:56,395 --> 00:46:58,313
And there was that man.

399
00:46:58,397 --> 00:47:00,315
The one with the dogs.

400
00:47:00,399 --> 00:47:02,359
Who?

401
00:47:03,819 --> 00:47:06,488
That new janitor.

402
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:08,865
He said he was my father.

403
00:47:13,996 --> 00:47:16,164
I'll get it.

404
00:47:26,382 --> 00:47:28,384
My father.

405
00:47:37,977 --> 00:47:40,062
My, my.

406
00:47:40,104 --> 00:47:42,356
So this is the young Bruce Ban...

407
00:47:44,609 --> 00:47:47,028
Krenzler.

408
00:47:48,613 --> 00:47:52,533
I think you left something
in your lab last night.

409
00:47:54,619 --> 00:47:56,370
Mitchell.

410
00:47:56,412 --> 00:47:59,248
Escort my daughter outside.
I'll join her shortly.

411
00:48:00,958 --> 00:48:02,752
I'd rather stay here.

412
00:48:02,835 --> 00:48:05,337
Now, Betty.

413
00:48:06,671 --> 00:48:08,632
It's okay.

414
00:48:08,673 --> 00:48:10,634
I'll be fine.

415
00:48:21,686 --> 00:48:24,189
Keep him under observation.
I'll be back.

416
00:48:31,613 --> 00:48:34,658
- What?
- Your friend in there.

417
00:48:34,699 --> 00:48:38,411
There's a good chance he's caught
up in some very bad business.

418
00:48:38,495 --> 00:48:40,413
Unfinished business.

419
00:48:40,497 --> 00:48:43,582
And I promise you, I'm gonna
get to the bottom of it.

420
00:48:43,707 --> 00:48:46,585
You have my word
I'll make sure he's cared for.

421
00:48:46,669 --> 00:48:49,588
But as of right now,
he is incommunicado.

422
00:48:49,672 --> 00:48:52,091
And for the next
few days at least,

423
00:48:52,174 --> 00:48:54,051
you're gonna stay away from here.

424
00:48:54,134 --> 00:48:56,136
For your own good.

425
00:49:04,561 --> 00:49:08,232
Okay, and that's for the new guy
on the night shift, right?

426
00:49:08,274 --> 00:49:11,277
Great. Thank you.
I appreciate it.

427
00:49:28,668 --> 00:49:30,670
Dr. Ross.

428
00:49:30,712 --> 00:49:33,673
How unexpected.

429
00:49:33,756 --> 00:49:35,758
Please come in.

430
00:49:41,097 --> 00:49:44,684
I'm sorry to just show up
at your house like this.

431
00:49:44,767 --> 00:49:46,811
Uh...

432
00:49:49,731 --> 00:49:52,233
I came to ask you something that...

433
00:49:52,317 --> 00:49:56,029
I really have no business asking

434
00:49:57,614 --> 00:50:00,033
He told you?

435
00:50:00,116 --> 00:50:02,118
He said you talked to him.

436
00:50:02,201 --> 00:50:04,161
Oh.

437
00:50:04,202 --> 00:50:06,204
Please sit down.

438
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:18,425
Bruce was at the lab last night.
He said that you were there too.

439
00:50:18,508 --> 00:50:21,386
But he can't remember much about it

440
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:23,639
I need to find out what happened.

441
00:50:23,722 --> 00:50:25,724
So, you want to know, uh,

442
00:50:25,724 --> 00:50:27,809
what's wrong with him...

443
00:50:28,727 --> 00:50:30,854
so you can fix him?

444
00:50:30,979 --> 00:50:33,315
Cure him, change him.

445
00:50:35,317 --> 00:50:37,736
My father's with the military.

446
00:50:37,819 --> 00:50:40,739
He seems to think he's involved in
some kind of threat to national security

447
00:50:40,822 --> 00:50:42,741
Mmm.

448
00:50:42,824 --> 00:50:46,202
Your father. Ross.

449
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:51,040
You brought your father
down upon his head?

450
00:50:51,123 --> 00:50:54,126
How little you understand,
Miss Ross,

451
00:50:54,168 --> 00:50:58,047
and how dangerous
your ignorance has become.

452
00:50:59,757 --> 00:51:02,009
I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry.

453
00:51:02,093 --> 00:51:04,136
My son is...

454
00:51:05,596 --> 00:51:07,556
unique.

455
00:51:07,598 --> 00:51:09,517
That's why you can't relate to him.

456
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:14,230
And because he is unique, the world
will not tolerate his existence.

457
00:51:14,272 --> 00:51:16,232
Will they?

458
00:51:17,358 --> 00:51:19,360
But you...

459
00:51:20,987 --> 00:51:22,738
you try,

460
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:24,739
don't you?

461
00:51:24,781 --> 00:51:26,825
Yes.

462
00:51:32,038 --> 00:51:35,542
And a very beautiful
woman like you,

463
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:38,378
your attentions...

464
00:51:38,461 --> 00:51:42,132
can't be completely unwanted.

465
00:51:43,091 --> 00:51:44,634
Can they?

466
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:48,221
No.

467
00:51:48,263 --> 00:51:51,766
Not with eyes like yours,

468
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:54,728
watching expectantly,

469
00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:57,856
lovingly.

470
00:52:00,442 --> 00:52:03,278
But I'm afraid
we're both too late to help him.

471
00:52:03,361 --> 00:52:05,571
There's nothing
I can do for him...

472
00:52:05,654 --> 00:52:07,781
or for you.

473
00:52:07,865 --> 00:52:09,867
Besides,

474
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,787
he's made it clear he wants
nothing to do with me.

475
00:52:13,912 --> 00:52:15,789
His choice.

476
00:52:15,914 --> 00:52:19,710
Now, if you'll excuse me, Miss Ross,
I have some work to do.

477
00:52:19,793 --> 00:52:23,005
And don't worry about the dogs.

478
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:25,007
You'll be fine.

479
00:52:25,132 --> 00:52:27,635
Just don't look 'em in the eyes.

480
00:52:30,179 --> 00:52:32,056
Good-bye.

481
00:52:34,099 --> 00:52:37,561
He gets released, and a month later
your lab is destroyed.

482
00:52:37,645 --> 00:52:39,521
What a coincidence.

483
00:52:39,647 --> 00:52:42,566
So you're not gonna tell me
where he is, are ya?

484
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:45,860
How many times do I have to tell you?
I'd like to help you, but I just don't know

485
00:52:45,985 --> 00:52:48,237
You know who I am.
Right, Banner?

486
00:52:48,321 --> 00:52:51,115
- Your Betty's father.
You're a high-ranking general.
- Let's cut the crap.

487
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:54,994
I'm the guy who had your father
tossed away, and a lot more like him,

488
00:52:55,036 --> 00:52:58,706
and I'll do the same with you if I
feel so disposed. You understand?

489
00:52:58,831 --> 00:53:01,209
If you had him tossed away,
then why are you asking me?

490
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:05,338
I don't remember.
I was always told my father was dead.

491
00:53:05,421 --> 00:53:07,340
Don't play with me!

492
00:53:07,423 --> 00:53:09,842
You were four years old
when you saw it.

493
00:53:09,968 --> 00:53:12,387
When I saw what?

494
00:53:12,428 --> 00:53:16,266
You were right there.  How could
anyone forget a thing like that?

495
00:53:17,475 --> 00:53:19,394
What?

496
00:53:19,477 --> 00:53:22,480
Oh, some more repressed memories.

497
00:53:25,565 --> 00:53:27,567
Just tell me.

498
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,823
I'm sorry, son.

499
00:53:33,824 --> 00:53:37,369
You're an even more screwed-up mess
than I thought you'd be.

500
00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:40,872
Until we get
to the bottom of this,

501
00:53:40,914 --> 00:53:43,917
your lab has been declared
a top-secret military site...

502
00:53:43,959 --> 00:53:47,379
and you're not gonna get
a security clearance to get back into it...

503
00:53:47,462 --> 00:53:50,424
or any other lab that's doing
anything more interesting than...

504
00:53:50,465 --> 00:53:54,011
trying to figure out
the next generation of herbal hair gel.

505
00:53:57,598 --> 00:53:59,641
One more thing.

506
00:53:59,725 --> 00:54:01,685
If you ever...

507
00:54:01,810 --> 00:54:06,397
come within a thousand yards
of my daughter again,

508
00:54:06,439 --> 00:54:09,650
I'll put you away for the
rest of your natural life.

509
00:54:23,956 --> 00:54:25,875
Dogs!

510
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,880
Go! Go get her!

511
00:54:30,963 --> 00:54:33,966
And let nothing stand in your way!

512
00:54:34,008 --> 00:54:36,302
Go!

513
00:55:40,447 --> 00:55:42,366
Hello?

514
00:55:42,491 --> 00:55:44,368
Bruce?

515
00:55:44,451 --> 00:55:48,455
So, they think they can just
throw you away as they did me.

516
00:55:56,755 --> 00:55:59,425
What's wrong with me?
What did you do to me?

517
00:55:59,508 --> 00:56:01,427
I got a visit today.

518
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:03,886
A very unwelcome visit.

519
00:56:03,928 --> 00:56:06,514
I'm afraid my hand is being forced

520
00:56:06,598 --> 00:56:09,767
What did you do to me?

521
00:56:09,851 --> 00:56:12,770
You so much want to know, don't you?

522
00:56:12,854 --> 00:56:17,025
But I think no explanation
will serve you half as well...

523
00:56:17,066 --> 00:56:19,611
as the experience.

524
00:56:19,736 --> 00:56:24,490
In any case, I still don't
quite understand it myself.

525
00:56:24,532 --> 00:56:27,535
If they'd only let me
work in peace...

526
00:56:27,535 --> 00:56:30,705
Of course, my betters
would have none of that.

527
00:56:30,788 --> 00:56:33,708
So you experimented
on yourself, didn't you?

528
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:37,462
And passed on to me... what?

529
00:56:37,545 --> 00:56:40,089
An alteration. Genetic.

530
00:56:40,214 --> 00:56:44,468
A deformity.
I guess you could call it that.

531
00:56:44,551 --> 00:56:47,095
But an amazing strength too.

532
00:56:47,179 --> 00:56:50,140
And now, finally unleashed,
I can harvest it.

533
00:56:50,223 --> 00:56:52,100
No.

534
00:56:52,184 --> 00:56:54,102
You'll do no such thing.

535
00:56:54,186 --> 00:56:56,688
I will isolate it
and treat it myself.

536
00:56:56,730 --> 00:57:00,150
I'll remove it and I'll kill it
before it does any real harm.

537
00:57:00,192 --> 00:57:03,070
I'll bet you and your Betty
would love to destroy it.

538
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:06,365
But would you really
destroy part of yourself?

539
00:57:07,407 --> 00:57:10,035
I don't think so.

540
00:57:10,118 --> 00:57:12,037
And as for Betty,

541
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:14,122
I'm sending her a surprise visit...

542
00:57:14,164 --> 00:57:16,583
from some four-legged
friends of mine.

543
00:57:16,667 --> 00:57:21,171
You see, I managed to culture
some of your very own DNA, Bruce,

544
00:57:21,255 --> 00:57:23,923
and the results are tremendous.

545
00:57:23,965 --> 00:57:27,760
They're unstable, but very powerful.

546
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:31,389
What about my DNA?

547
00:57:31,472 --> 00:57:35,518
Let's just wait and see what Betty
makes of the results, huh?

548
00:57:35,601 --> 00:57:37,520
No. You're crazy.

549
00:57:37,603 --> 00:57:39,563
I won't let you.

550
00:57:42,608 --> 00:57:45,319
Get your hands off of me.
Talbot, what's this...

551
00:57:45,403 --> 00:57:47,697
Inside, asshole.
I wanna talk to you.

552
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:49,699
Listen, my father's
going after Betty...

553
00:57:49,782 --> 00:57:53,035
What makes you think you can go behind
my back and get Ross to cut me out, huh?

554
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:56,497
Listen to me!
Betty's in trouble!

555
00:57:59,834 --> 00:58:01,836
You pathetic freak.

556
00:58:01,877 --> 00:58:04,296
Betty's in danger.
I swear to you, she'll be killed.

557
00:58:04,337 --> 00:58:06,256
I can state the obvious.

558
00:58:06,339 --> 00:58:09,634
Something tells me you aren't in much of a
position to be making stupid threats to anyone

559
00:58:14,598 --> 00:58:16,683
- Talbot.
- Yeah?

560
00:58:16,766 --> 00:58:18,643
You're making me angry.

561
00:58:18,727 --> 00:58:21,021
Oh, am I?

562
00:59:14,448 --> 00:59:16,700
Ohh! Oh!

563
00:59:16,742 --> 00:59:19,078
I got him! Open fire!

564
01:01:09,226 --> 01:01:11,979
Bruce?

565
01:06:38,715 --> 01:06:42,010
He sent these dogs, didn't he?

566
01:06:42,135 --> 01:06:44,511
But I killed them!

567
01:07:09,411 --> 01:07:11,455
My God.

568
01:07:11,538 --> 01:07:14,207
It must be the nanomeds.
It must be the gamma exposure.

569
01:07:14,291 --> 01:07:17,044
But we've never seen
any effect like this before.

570
01:07:17,127 --> 01:07:19,046
No. Deeper.

571
01:07:19,129 --> 01:07:22,674
The gamma just unleashed
what was already there.

572
01:07:22,758 --> 01:07:25,301
Unleashed what?

573
01:07:25,384 --> 01:07:28,387
Me.

574
01:07:28,471 --> 01:07:31,182
It.

575
01:07:31,265 --> 01:07:33,809
It's okay.

576
01:07:33,893 --> 01:07:35,561
Shh. It's okay.

577
01:07:37,355 --> 01:07:40,024
What were those animals?

578
01:07:40,107 --> 01:07:43,069
My father sent them.

579
01:07:43,194 --> 01:07:45,905
He is my father.

580
01:07:45,988 --> 01:07:48,074
He wanted me to change.

581
01:07:48,157 --> 01:07:51,494
He wanted me to change
into that mindless hulk.

582
01:07:51,577 --> 01:07:53,704
Why would he want that?

583
01:07:55,122 --> 01:07:57,375
Can you remember anything?

584
01:07:57,416 --> 01:08:00,711
Is there anything
from when you were changed?

585
01:08:03,506 --> 01:08:06,424
It was like a dream.

586
01:08:06,508 --> 01:08:09,386
About what?

587
01:08:10,762 --> 01:08:12,764
Rage.

588
01:08:14,224 --> 01:08:16,226
Power.

589
01:08:17,811 --> 01:08:20,272
And freedom.

590
01:08:38,123 --> 01:08:41,459
Hello? Sir.

591
01:08:42,877 --> 01:08:44,878
- Hello.
- Dad?

592
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:47,298
Betty! Are you all right?

593
01:08:49,508 --> 01:08:53,137
I'm scared.
I need your help.

594
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:55,222
Where are you?

595
01:09:05,649 --> 01:09:07,985
How are you?

596
01:09:08,068 --> 01:09:10,696
Okay, I guess.

597
01:09:14,366 --> 01:09:16,702
I think that somehow...

598
01:09:16,785 --> 01:09:20,080
your anger is triggering
the nanomeds.

599
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:24,542
How could it?  We designed them
to respond to physical damage.

600
01:09:24,626 --> 01:09:27,712
Emotional damage
can manifest physically.

601
01:09:29,130 --> 01:09:31,299
Like what?

602
01:09:34,427 --> 01:09:36,554
Serious trauma.

603
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:40,475
Repressed memories.

604
01:09:45,939 --> 01:09:50,777
Your father grilled me about something that
happened to me from early childhood...

605
01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:53,154
that I'm supposed to remember.

606
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:54,697
He did?

607
01:09:54,739 --> 01:09:59,786
It sounded bad,
but... I honestly don't remember.

608
01:10:02,956 --> 01:10:05,499
The thing that worries me...

609
01:10:05,582 --> 01:10:07,584
is...

610
01:10:07,668 --> 01:10:09,753
a physical wound is finite,

611
01:10:09,836 --> 01:10:11,755
but with emotions,

612
01:10:11,838 --> 01:10:15,634
what's to say it won't
just go on and on...

613
01:10:15,676 --> 01:10:19,221
and start a chain reaction?

614
01:10:21,390 --> 01:10:24,017
You know what scares me the most?

615
01:10:25,936 --> 01:10:27,980
When it happens,

616
01:10:29,147 --> 01:10:31,275
when it comes over me...

617
01:10:31,358 --> 01:10:34,403
and I totally lose control,

618
01:10:36,196 --> 01:10:38,240
I like it.

619
01:10:55,381 --> 01:10:58,050
It's okay. I got you.
I'm sorry.

620
01:10:58,217 --> 01:11:01,887
You'll be okay.
It's just to make you sleep.

621
01:11:01,929 --> 01:11:03,806
Target down.
Target secure.

622
01:11:03,931 --> 01:11:06,726
I'm going to take you someplace safe

623
01:11:06,767 --> 01:11:10,021
Okay? Bruce?

624
01:11:10,062 --> 01:11:12,565
Bruce?

625
01:11:12,607 --> 01:11:14,609
Bruce?

626
01:13:48,383 --> 01:13:50,719
Clear!

627
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:03,273
- Attention on deck.
- Carry on.

628
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,075
We're buried out here
in the middle of nowhere.

629
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,577
How long are you
gonna keep him sedated?

630
01:14:16,661 --> 01:14:18,871
For the rest of his
natural life, if I have to.

631
01:14:18,913 --> 01:14:21,874
You said I could trust you.
I'm your father.

632
01:14:21,916 --> 01:14:26,212
You can trust me to do what I think
is right, not what you think you want

633
01:14:26,254 --> 01:14:30,299
- He is a human being.
- He is also something else.

634
01:14:30,424 --> 01:14:33,970
Suppose he gets out,
has one of his little mood swings...

635
01:14:34,011 --> 01:14:35,388
in a populated area.

636
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:40,142
Yes, I'm aware of the potential danger.
I'm also aware that he saved my life.

637
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:43,145
Yeah, from a mutant
French poodle.

638
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:45,480
I'm indebted to him for that.

639
01:14:45,564 --> 01:14:49,109
He also put three men in a hospital,
and Talbot's barely walking!

640
01:14:49,192 --> 01:14:53,446
- What do you want me to do?
- I want you to help him!

641
01:14:53,488 --> 01:14:57,325
- Why is he such a threat to you?
- Because I know what he comes from.

642
01:14:57,450 --> 01:15:01,580
He is his father's son,
every last molecule of him.

643
01:15:01,621 --> 01:15:04,207
He says he doesn't know his father

644
01:15:04,249 --> 01:15:09,671
but he's workin'in the same
exact goddamn field his father did.

645
01:15:09,713 --> 01:15:14,050
So either he's lyin'...
or it's somethin' worse, and he's...

646
01:15:14,092 --> 01:15:16,136
What?

647
01:15:16,219 --> 01:15:20,015
Predestined to follow
in his father's footsteps?

648
01:15:21,474 --> 01:15:24,436
I was gonna say "damned."

649
01:15:24,519 --> 01:15:27,021
Of course you were.

650
01:15:27,062 --> 01:15:28,522
But I'm a scientist.

651
01:15:28,606 --> 01:15:33,110
As a scientist, I believe we can figure
this out and he can be helped.

652
01:15:33,152 --> 01:15:36,488
I know you do.

653
01:15:36,530 --> 01:15:40,034
Look, whether you know or care,

654
01:15:40,075 --> 01:15:43,621
I've got a lot of pride
in what you've done.

655
01:15:43,704 --> 01:15:46,707
But this is too big for you.

656
01:15:46,790 --> 01:15:50,753
Look, I know the government thinks
they have a weapon on their hands.

657
01:15:50,836 --> 01:15:53,464
Otherwise, he'd be dead by now.

658
01:15:53,505 --> 01:15:55,883
They can probe and prod
all they want,

659
01:15:55,966 --> 01:15:58,260
and in the meanwhile,
just let me try to help him.

660
01:15:58,344 --> 01:16:01,680
Nobody knows him better than I do

661
01:16:04,558 --> 01:16:07,393
What did David Banner do to him?

662
01:16:11,272 --> 01:16:13,191
Cover left!
Clear left.

663
01:16:13,233 --> 01:16:15,193
Cover right!

664
01:18:25,862 --> 01:18:28,782
What's happening here?

665
01:18:28,782 --> 01:18:31,368
My hand.

666
01:18:32,786 --> 01:18:36,998
You see, the strength
of my son's DNA...

667
01:18:37,082 --> 01:18:41,419
combined with nanomed
reconstruction...

668
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:47,883
You see, I can partake
with the essences of all things.

669
01:18:49,677 --> 01:18:52,179
Gonna have to ask you to...

670
01:18:52,221 --> 01:18:55,266
put your hands up, pal, okay?

671
01:18:55,349 --> 01:18:58,769
Nice and easy.

672
01:19:03,691 --> 01:19:05,734
Do you really believe...

673
01:19:05,859 --> 01:19:10,531
that I am separate from you?

674
01:19:10,573 --> 01:19:12,866
Whoa!

675
01:19:27,630 --> 01:19:29,632
Where am I?

676
01:19:33,595 --> 01:19:35,555
You're home.

677
01:19:47,859 --> 01:19:50,778
It's hard to believe
we used to live here.

678
01:19:53,406 --> 01:19:56,367
I must have seen you or known you.

679
01:19:56,451 --> 01:19:59,287
If only I could remember.

680
01:20:33,028 --> 01:20:35,948
This is my old house, isn't it?

681
01:21:14,569 --> 01:21:16,654
Let's go.

682
01:21:18,364 --> 01:21:20,324
Please try.

683
01:22:14,501 --> 01:22:16,587
What is it?

684
01:22:16,712 --> 01:22:18,714
Nothing.

685
01:22:18,756 --> 01:22:20,799
Really?

686
01:22:23,135 --> 01:22:25,638
Damn it.

687
01:22:30,267 --> 01:22:34,438
Okay, Betty...
what do you want to know?

688
01:22:37,775 --> 01:22:40,486
What was in that room?

689
01:22:51,371 --> 01:22:54,082
What are you afraid that I'll see?

690
01:22:59,295 --> 01:23:03,132
See? There's nothing.

691
01:23:03,216 --> 01:23:06,427
It's empty.

692
01:23:18,314 --> 01:23:21,109
What do you mean,
I don't have access to him?

693
01:23:21,150 --> 01:23:26,572
NSA has decided to turn over study
of the, uh... the threat to Atheon.

694
01:23:26,613 --> 01:23:29,157
But you're head of the base.

695
01:23:29,199 --> 01:23:31,660
I thought you were in charge.

696
01:23:31,743 --> 01:23:36,373
But I don't set policy,
and I still take orders.

697
01:23:38,750 --> 01:23:42,713
I can't believe Talbot
would go around me like this!

698
01:23:44,131 --> 01:23:47,801
Oh, there's a lot of powerful people
that want in on this.

699
01:23:47,885 --> 01:23:51,179
And money to be made...
lots of it.

700
01:23:56,184 --> 01:23:59,396
You know the worst part
about all this?

701
01:23:59,479 --> 01:24:02,524
When I had David Banner locked up
and sent that kid away,

702
01:24:02,608 --> 01:24:06,819
I didn't give that boy a second thought;
he was just collateral damage.

703
01:24:06,861 --> 01:24:10,072
Well, he isn't anymore, is he?

704
01:24:12,366 --> 01:24:14,327
What can I do?

705
01:24:14,368 --> 01:24:17,872
You can go home now.

706
01:24:19,832 --> 01:24:23,002
I'd tell you to go and say good-bye,
but I've already been informed...

707
01:24:23,127 --> 01:24:26,881
that for now all further contact
is out of the question.

708
01:24:28,257 --> 01:24:29,717
Right.

709
01:25:08,171 --> 01:25:12,634
Hiya, Bruce. How ya feelin'?
Grub okay in here for ya?

710
01:25:12,676 --> 01:25:15,011
What do you want?

711
01:25:15,095 --> 01:25:17,472
That's a good question.

712
01:25:17,514 --> 01:25:22,269
See, I need your cells to trigger
some chemical distress signals.

713
01:25:22,352 --> 01:25:26,188
You know, so you can turn
a little green for me again...

714
01:25:26,272 --> 01:25:29,525
and I can carve off
a piece of the real you,

715
01:25:29,608 --> 01:25:32,570
analyze it, patent it,
make a fortune.

716
01:25:33,821 --> 01:25:36,407
Do you mind?

717
01:25:36,490 --> 01:25:38,701
I'll never let you.

718
01:25:38,784 --> 01:25:41,328
I'm not sure you've got
much of a choice.

719
01:25:43,873 --> 01:25:46,542
Come on, Bruce.
Aren't you feeling a little angry?

720
01:25:46,625 --> 01:25:50,921
After all, you've only got me to play with now
that Betty's dumped you and gone back to Berkeley

721
01:25:51,171 --> 01:25:52,756
You're lying.

722
01:25:52,798 --> 01:25:55,217
You know, for me
this is a win-win situation.

723
01:25:55,342 --> 01:25:57,678
You turn green, and all these guys
come in and kill you...

724
01:25:57,720 --> 01:25:59,555
and I perform the autopsy.

725
01:25:59,597 --> 01:26:02,766
You don't...

726
01:26:02,850 --> 01:26:04,727
And I mop the floor with you...

727
01:26:04,810 --> 01:26:07,770
and maybe by accident
go too far and break your neck.

728
01:26:07,854 --> 01:26:12,108
Bad science, maybe...
but personally gratifying.

729
01:26:14,527 --> 01:26:18,114
Come on, Bruce!
Let's see what you got.

730
01:26:18,198 --> 01:26:20,783
Never.

731
01:26:26,456 --> 01:26:28,750
You know, consciously
you may control it,

732
01:26:28,833 --> 01:26:32,462
but subconsciously,
I bet that's another story.

733
01:27:03,116 --> 01:27:06,203
All right, let's jump-start
those brain waves.

734
01:27:17,297 --> 01:27:19,258
Bruce.

735
01:27:32,270 --> 01:27:34,730
- My dear Miss Ross.

736
01:27:34,772 --> 01:27:36,691
Welcome back.

737
01:27:36,774 --> 01:27:39,443
There are two guards
right outside.

738
01:27:39,527 --> 01:27:44,657
You don't have to worry.
I'm not angry with you. Not anymore.

739
01:27:44,740 --> 01:27:46,993
What do you want?

740
01:27:47,076 --> 01:27:50,288
It's over for me now.
I know that.

741
01:27:50,371 --> 01:27:53,958
And soon it'll be over for Bruce.

742
01:27:54,041 --> 01:27:56,502
That's why I've come to you...

743
01:27:56,586 --> 01:28:00,798
to ask you if you could
persuade your father,

744
01:28:00,882 --> 01:28:03,634
as a man, as a father himself,

745
01:28:03,718 --> 01:28:08,346
that if I turn myself in now,
peacefully...

746
01:28:08,388 --> 01:28:11,975
and before
he puts me away forever,

747
01:28:12,017 --> 01:28:14,895
that he would let me see my son...

748
01:28:14,978 --> 01:28:17,522
for one last time.

749
01:28:17,564 --> 01:28:20,400
Could you do that for me?

750
01:28:22,944 --> 01:28:25,655
It's out of my father's hands now.

751
01:28:30,327 --> 01:28:33,622
I understand.
He's a puppet now.

752
01:28:34,915 --> 01:28:37,250
I don't blame him.
You shouldn't.

753
01:28:37,292 --> 01:28:41,046
You should blame yourself
for what you've done to your son.

754
01:28:41,129 --> 01:28:44,841
And what have I done
to my son, Miss Ross?

755
01:28:44,925 --> 01:28:50,262
Nothing. I tried to improve
on the limits in myself.

756
01:28:50,346 --> 01:28:52,681
Myself! Not him!

757
01:28:52,723 --> 01:28:56,310
Can you understand?
To improve on nature.

758
01:28:56,393 --> 01:28:59,355
My nature!
Knowledge of oneself!

759
01:28:59,438 --> 01:29:02,399
It's the only path to the truth...

760
01:29:02,399 --> 01:29:06,487
that give men the power
to go beyond God's boundaries!

761
01:29:07,488 --> 01:29:11,909
You know what's beyond
your boundaries? Other people.

762
01:29:11,992 --> 01:29:15,037
All you've given Bruce is fear.

763
01:29:17,373 --> 01:29:20,084
Fear of life.

764
01:29:22,253 --> 01:29:24,171
Fear?

765
01:29:25,589 --> 01:29:27,549
Perhaps, Miss Ross.

766
01:29:29,592 --> 01:29:32,011
And loneliness too.

767
01:29:32,053 --> 01:29:36,891
Yes... I feel them both.

768
01:29:40,436 --> 01:29:45,275
But I have lived...
completely once.

769
01:29:47,610 --> 01:29:50,280
I was so much in love,

770
01:29:50,321 --> 01:29:53,324
and she so much wanted a baby.

771
01:29:53,366 --> 01:29:55,326
My baby.

772
01:30:03,001 --> 01:30:05,836
I could tell
from the moment she conceived...

773
01:30:05,961 --> 01:30:08,922
that it wasn't a son
I had given her...

774
01:30:09,047 --> 01:30:11,300
but something else.

775
01:30:11,383 --> 01:30:13,760
A monster, maybe.

776
01:30:13,802 --> 01:30:16,597
I should have put a stop to it
right then,

777
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:21,101
but I was curious
and that was my downfall.

778
01:30:21,226 --> 01:30:25,147
And as I watched this tiny life unfold,

779
01:30:25,314 --> 01:30:28,525
I began to imagine the horror of it,

780
01:30:28,609 --> 01:30:32,905
and my curiosity was replaced...

781
01:30:32,988 --> 01:30:35,991
with compassion.

782
01:30:38,327 --> 01:30:40,996
But they took away
my chance to cure him.

783
01:30:41,079 --> 01:30:43,373
Your father threw me out.

784
01:30:43,457 --> 01:30:46,959
- What are you doing?
- I remember that day so well...

785
01:30:47,043 --> 01:30:49,837
every moment, every sensation...

786
01:30:49,921 --> 01:30:52,173
walking into the house,

787
01:30:52,256 --> 01:30:55,468
the feeling of the handle
of the knife in my hand.

788
01:30:55,509 --> 01:31:00,556
I knew I was doing a father's work,
fulfilling a father's mercy.

789
01:31:00,556 --> 01:31:03,643
David, please stop it! No!

790
01:31:03,726 --> 01:31:06,187
David, no!
Talk to me! Listen!

791
01:31:06,270 --> 01:31:09,190
But then she surprised me.

792
01:31:09,232 --> 01:31:12,985
- No! No!

793
01:31:13,069 --> 01:31:15,112
David, no!

794
01:31:15,154 --> 01:31:18,366
It was as if...

795
01:31:18,491 --> 01:31:21,869
she and the knife...

796
01:31:21,953 --> 01:31:24,622
merged.

797
01:31:33,255 --> 01:31:35,423
No!

798
01:31:35,507 --> 01:31:38,218
You cannot imagine...

799
01:31:38,301 --> 01:31:41,930
the unbearable finality of it.

800
01:31:42,013 --> 01:31:45,475
And in that one moment...

801
01:31:45,517 --> 01:31:49,771
I took everything that was dear to me...

802
01:31:49,855 --> 01:31:54,192
and transformed it into nothing more...

803
01:31:54,276 --> 01:31:56,278
than a memory.

804
01:32:11,667 --> 01:32:15,004
Bingo! That must be some
jumbo nightmare he just had.

805
01:32:19,675 --> 01:32:21,886
Okay, do it now.
Start the enzyme extraction.

806
01:32:26,640 --> 01:32:28,976
Sir, negative on drill penetration.

807
01:32:29,059 --> 01:32:32,771
Damn it, drill him harder! Give him full RPMs
Come on, Holeman! Come on!

808
01:32:46,826 --> 01:32:51,331
-Should I neutralize?
-No, I can't do anything with goop, c'mon on

809
01:33:03,468 --> 01:33:06,638
- All right, put him to sleep.

810
01:33:15,563 --> 01:33:17,857
It's not stopping him!

811
01:33:24,989 --> 01:33:27,449
Ready room, send in
our containment team.

812
01:33:27,533 --> 01:33:30,285
Non-lethals only.
I repeat, non-lethals only.

813
01:33:30,369 --> 01:33:32,579
I must have a sample of him.

814
01:33:32,663 --> 01:33:34,581
Sir!

815
01:33:36,250 --> 01:33:39,753
- Jesus!
- Hit him with the foam.

816
01:33:39,795 --> 01:33:41,713
Deploy containment foam.

817
01:33:42,798 --> 01:33:44,758
Talbot, talk to me.

818
01:33:46,343 --> 01:33:49,763
Under control, General. I'll let
you know if we need you.

819
01:33:49,805 --> 01:33:52,474
Unacceptable.  Unseat your
asses down here immediately.

820
01:33:52,516 --> 01:33:54,643
I want a full-court evacuation now.

821
01:33:54,726 --> 01:33:57,145
I'm shutting you down.
Lockdown.

822
01:33:57,145 --> 01:33:59,982
-Didn't you hear what the general said?
-I said lockdown!

823
01:34:02,693 --> 01:34:05,153
Clear! I need a sample of him!

824
01:34:07,154 --> 01:34:10,491
Take it easy there, buddy.

825
01:34:10,616 --> 01:34:14,412
This might give you
a bit of a sting here, Bruce.

826
01:34:26,549 --> 01:34:29,886
- Fall back! Fall back!
- Clear your weapon! Clear it!

827
01:34:29,969 --> 01:34:33,556
- Give me the M2.
- So long, big boy.

828
01:34:33,639 --> 01:34:36,017
Clear!

829
01:34:45,902 --> 01:34:49,029
Lockdown the entire facility immediately

830
01:34:53,241 --> 01:34:56,244
Target's still moving towards blue level

831
01:34:56,328 --> 01:34:59,581
- Evacuate the main hall.

832
01:35:03,919 --> 01:35:07,547
Send in backup, heavy weapons.
Issue general quarters.

833
01:35:07,589 --> 01:35:10,342
Set firing lines left and right!

834
01:35:10,342 --> 01:35:13,094
Heavy weapons, go, go, go!

835
01:35:34,907 --> 01:35:37,076
Contamination, sir.
System readings are redline.

836
01:35:37,117 --> 01:35:39,328
Data's on backup power supply.

837
01:35:46,293 --> 01:35:48,462
Incoming!

838
01:35:55,219 --> 01:35:57,930
-Shut down all power to the main hall
-Sir?

839
01:35:57,972 --> 01:36:02,601
Show him the way out.
We'll fight him outside.

840
01:38:11,142 --> 01:38:14,229
Driver, stop.
Driver, stop.

841
01:38:21,236 --> 01:38:23,738
Gunner, traverse left!
Traverse left!

842
01:39:06,405 --> 01:39:08,324
Clear back! Clear back!

843
01:40:02,502 --> 01:40:06,713
Mr. President,
I have some bad news, sir.

844
01:40:06,797 --> 01:40:08,757
Let's have it, General.

845
01:40:08,882 --> 01:40:12,052
I've briefed the president on Angry Man.
I assume that's what this is about.

846
01:40:12,094 --> 01:40:16,849
It is, ma'am. I'm requesting
a National Command Authority override.

847
01:40:16,890 --> 01:40:19,726
Angry Man is unsecure.

848
01:40:19,768 --> 01:40:24,147
I need everything we have at my disposal
in order to stop his movement.

849
01:40:24,273 --> 01:40:27,776
You're expecting
civilian casualties, General?

850
01:40:27,860 --> 01:40:30,112
Not if I can help it, ma'am.

851
01:40:30,195 --> 01:40:32,447
Consider it done.  Keep us posted.

852
01:41:21,037 --> 01:41:22,955
Contact Goodman Control.

853
01:41:23,039 --> 01:41:25,541
Patch data to the assets.

854
01:41:25,625 --> 01:41:28,460
Contact H.Q.

855
01:41:28,502 --> 01:41:32,297
Have them initiate
an immediate evacuation...

856
01:41:32,380 --> 01:41:37,552
in vicinity of grid coordinates
653-216...

857
01:42:11,669 --> 01:42:13,838
Confirm that the area
has been cleared.

858
01:42:13,921 --> 01:42:16,423
Confirm area cleared.

859
01:42:16,465 --> 01:42:19,385
H.Q. Confirms area cleared.
Assets on-line, sir.

860
01:42:19,426 --> 01:42:21,720
Gentlemen, it's time to dig in.

861
01:42:21,804 --> 01:42:25,224
I want this target
stopped in his tracks.

862
01:43:14,856 --> 01:43:16,774
Jesus.

863
01:43:31,955 --> 01:43:35,417
Mayday! Mayday! Ah, shit!

864
01:43:41,298 --> 01:43:45,469
Tango Four is down. Have C-SAR
respond to our 20 ASAP.

865
01:43:45,552 --> 01:43:49,723
We're okay, but, damn it, get him
off us before he tears us apart!

866
01:43:49,806 --> 01:43:52,476
I've got no shot.
Do you have a clear line of fire?

867
01:43:52,559 --> 01:43:54,811
Watch it, Tango Flight.

868
01:43:54,811 --> 01:43:57,231
Break left! Break left!

869
01:43:57,272 --> 01:44:00,776
Tango Three, pull back and set up
for a Hellfire shot.

870
01:44:00,817 --> 01:44:03,278
Hold your fire till we draw him off.

871
01:44:03,362 --> 01:44:05,656
Tango One is hot. Gun wazzed.

872
01:44:05,739 --> 01:44:08,324
Roger. Going hot. Guns ready.

873
01:44:12,328 --> 01:44:16,457
Engage at will.

874
01:44:35,601 --> 01:44:38,604
Tango One, pull back!
Clear my line!

875
01:44:38,604 --> 01:44:41,607
Tango Flight, clear back.
I've got him painted for Hellfire.

876
01:44:41,649 --> 01:44:46,195
Roger that. Tango One clear.
Take the shot.

877
01:45:04,421 --> 01:45:07,549
Tango One, Tango Three.
I have contact.

878
01:45:07,591 --> 01:45:10,093
Holy shit! He's got my missile!

879
01:45:12,012 --> 01:45:14,014
Mayday! Mayday!

880
01:45:16,516 --> 01:45:20,020
Mayday! Mayday!
We're hit! We're going down!

881
01:45:22,939 --> 01:45:25,317
Give me a head count.

882
01:45:25,358 --> 01:45:28,569
Tango Three, give me a sit rep.

883
01:45:28,652 --> 01:45:32,364
Our kite's busted up,
but we're okay.

884
01:45:32,406 --> 01:45:35,993
Tango Flight, do you have
eyes on the target?

885
01:45:36,035 --> 01:45:39,163
Tango One, I have him in the rocks.

886
01:45:39,205 --> 01:45:42,291
Salvo all. Turn it into a parking lot.

887
01:46:02,645 --> 01:46:05,272
T-bolt, your parking lot is ready.

888
01:46:05,272 --> 01:46:08,066
We're bingo for fuel and ammo.
R. T.B.

889
01:46:35,051 --> 01:46:37,220
T-bolt, this is Goodman Control.

890
01:46:37,303 --> 01:46:40,974
Be advised, target not destroyed.
He's on the move again.

891
01:46:40,974 --> 01:46:42,934
Damn!

892
01:46:42,976 --> 01:46:45,436
I've got it.

893
01:46:45,478 --> 01:46:47,646
It appears he's heading home.

894
01:46:47,729 --> 01:46:49,648
Launch fast movers.

895
01:46:49,731 --> 01:46:53,360
Have them intercept and engage.

896
01:46:53,443 --> 01:46:55,612
Hello?

897
01:46:55,654 --> 01:46:59,324
Betty, Bruce got out.
He's headed your way...

898
01:46:59,408 --> 01:47:01,118
and probably right for you.

899
01:47:01,201 --> 01:47:03,495
How far from the base are you?

900
01:47:03,579 --> 01:47:06,707
I'm already here.
They're taking his father in now.

901
01:47:06,790 --> 01:47:10,544
That's all good news.
Stay there, Betty.

902
01:47:24,474 --> 01:47:27,393
Legend One rolling in hot.
Legend Two breaking offleft.

903
01:47:27,476 --> 01:47:31,564
I think I can come back around
for a gun attack.

904
01:47:31,606 --> 01:47:34,942
Acquire a clear target.
Fire at will.

905
01:47:39,322 --> 01:47:43,201
Increase altitude.
Civilian aircraft in vicinity.

906
01:47:47,038 --> 01:47:50,583
Pull up! Pull up!
You're headed for the bridge!

907
01:47:50,666 --> 01:47:54,712
I can't pull up! I can't pull up!

908
01:48:02,887 --> 01:48:06,182
Okay, you've got him now. Take him
on a ride to the top of the world.

909
01:48:06,265 --> 01:48:09,184
Let's see what the thin air
will do for him.

910
01:48:09,267 --> 01:48:11,353
Initiating afterburner.

911
01:48:28,912 --> 01:48:30,956
I'm passing flight level 600.

912
01:48:31,039 --> 01:48:33,250
This is out of my envelope.

913
01:48:33,333 --> 01:48:35,293
Hang in there, Legend.

914
01:48:35,418 --> 01:48:38,839
I can't maintain.
He's all over my aerodynamics.

915
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:41,091
He'll lose consciousness before you.

916
01:48:44,761 --> 01:48:50,307
Nine-fifty. I can't hold it.
I'm pulling back!

917
01:49:36,728 --> 01:49:39,230
Puny human.

918
01:49:49,324 --> 01:49:51,284
Contact. He's in the water.
All units, weapons hot.

919
01:49:51,367 --> 01:49:53,745
Let's not take any chances.

920
01:49:53,828 --> 01:49:57,248
You are cleared to fire
on target, Legend.

921
01:50:18,268 --> 01:50:20,312
- Dad?
- Betty?

922
01:50:20,395 --> 01:50:22,815
We don't have a choice.

923
01:50:22,940 --> 01:50:25,275
I have to destroy him.

924
01:50:25,359 --> 01:50:29,446
But you can't.  You will only fuel
his rage, and you will make him stronger

925
01:50:29,530 --> 01:50:33,951
It's you he's coming for.
You know that.

926
01:50:35,118 --> 01:50:37,663
Then let me go to him.

927
01:50:37,704 --> 01:50:39,706
Please.

928
01:50:41,166 --> 01:50:43,919
Just give him a chance to calm down

929
01:51:08,401 --> 01:51:12,238
This area has been declared
restricted airspace.

930
01:51:12,321 --> 01:51:16,159
All aircraft are ordered
to clear the airspace immediately.

931
01:51:57,199 --> 01:51:59,784
Echo, One-niner. Weapons are hot.

932
01:51:59,868 --> 01:52:02,412
Target acquired.
Waiting your orders to engage.

933
01:52:02,454 --> 01:52:05,207
Repeat, waiting
your orders to engage.

934
01:52:05,290 --> 01:52:08,626
Command code yellow.
Hold for authorization.

935
01:52:18,093 --> 01:52:20,095
All units, hold your fire.

936
01:52:20,179 --> 01:52:23,557
This is T-bolt to all assets. You have
direct orders to hold your fire.

937
01:52:23,682 --> 01:52:26,143
I repeat, hold your fire.

938
01:52:26,227 --> 01:52:28,479
Echo, One-niner. Roger that.

939
01:52:42,618 --> 01:52:44,620
Go go, go, go, go, go!

940
01:53:14,649 --> 01:53:17,610
Hold your fire until my command!

941
01:53:20,155 --> 01:53:22,699
Engine 24 to command.
We are in position now.

942
01:54:30,056 --> 01:54:32,683
You found me.

943
01:54:34,060 --> 01:54:36,896
You weren't that hard to find.

944
01:54:38,481 --> 01:54:40,483
Yes, I was.

945
01:55:45,963 --> 01:55:47,923
Let's take a walk.

946
01:56:19,621 --> 01:56:22,916
That's the deal, gentlemen.
He stays on this base...

947
01:56:22,999 --> 01:56:27,378
until we get the final word from C-3
on how to dispose of him.

948
01:56:27,420 --> 01:56:32,342
In the meantime, ifhe does
anything but sit there in that chair,

949
01:56:32,467 --> 01:56:37,347
we're gonna turn on the juice
and he'll be incinerated immediately.

950
01:56:37,430 --> 01:56:39,849
We've established a
200-yard perimeter, sir.

951
01:56:39,933 --> 01:56:44,187
If we deploy the electromagnetic array,
there should be no collateral damage.

952
01:56:44,270 --> 01:56:47,106
Here they come!

953
01:56:53,195 --> 01:56:55,656
I'm doin' this for you, Betty.

954
01:56:55,739 --> 01:56:59,701
But one way or another, we're
gonna have to prepare for the worst.

955
01:58:48,974 --> 01:58:51,060
I should have killed you.

956
01:58:52,228 --> 01:58:54,814
And I should have killed you.

957
01:58:56,023 --> 01:58:58,400
I wish you had.

958
01:59:03,072 --> 01:59:05,449
I saw her last night.

959
01:59:07,618 --> 01:59:10,037
Saw her face.

960
01:59:10,079 --> 01:59:12,206
Brown hair.

961
01:59:13,999 --> 01:59:16,502
Brown eyes.

962
01:59:16,585 --> 01:59:19,421
She smiled at me.

963
01:59:19,505 --> 01:59:23,217
She reached down and kissed my cheek

964
01:59:24,552 --> 01:59:27,846
I can almost remember a smell.

965
01:59:31,015 --> 01:59:34,018
Almost like desert flowers.

966
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:37,605
Her favorite perfume.

967
01:59:40,441 --> 01:59:44,571
It's my mother,
and I don't even know her name.

968
01:59:52,537 --> 01:59:56,332
It's all right, son.
You go ahead and cry.

969
02:00:03,465 --> 02:00:06,259
Go ahead and cry.

970
02:00:09,178 --> 02:00:11,638
Cry. Crying will do you good.

971
02:00:11,805 --> 02:00:14,558
Don't touch me!

972
02:00:15,976 --> 02:00:18,770
Maybe once you were my father,

973
02:00:18,812 --> 02:00:21,565
but you're not now
and you never will be.

974
02:00:21,648 --> 02:00:25,194
Oh, is that so?

975
02:00:25,277 --> 02:00:30,949
Well, I got news for you.
I didn't come here to see you.

976
02:00:31,033 --> 02:00:34,119
I came here to see my son.

977
02:00:35,454 --> 02:00:37,581
My real son.

978
02:00:37,664 --> 02:00:40,167
The one inside of you.

979
02:00:40,209 --> 02:00:44,296
You're nothing but a superficial shell,

980
02:00:44,421 --> 02:00:46,548
a husk of flimsy consciousness...

981
02:00:46,632 --> 02:00:50,551
ready to be torn off
at a moment's notice.

982
02:00:50,593 --> 02:00:53,971
You can think what you like.
I don't care. Just go!

983
02:00:59,519 --> 02:01:02,980
No, son. Listen to me.
I found a cure.

984
02:01:03,064 --> 02:01:05,399
For me.

985
02:01:05,483 --> 02:01:08,736
My cells can transform too,

986
02:01:08,736 --> 02:01:11,656
absorb enormous amounts of energy.

987
02:01:11,781 --> 02:01:14,575
But, unlike you, they're unstable.

988
02:01:14,659 --> 02:01:17,912
Son, I need your strength.

989
02:01:17,995 --> 02:01:21,249
I gave you life.

990
02:01:21,374 --> 02:01:25,253
Now you must give it back to me!

991
02:01:25,294 --> 02:01:30,507
Only a million times
more radiant, more powerful!

992
02:01:30,590 --> 02:01:33,969
- Stop it.
- Stop? Stop what?

993
02:01:34,052 --> 02:01:36,805
Stop what?

994
02:01:36,888 --> 02:01:41,184
Think about all those men out there
in their uniforms...

995
02:01:41,309 --> 02:01:44,771
barking and swallowing orders,

996
02:01:44,855 --> 02:01:48,233
inflicting their petty rule
over the entire globe!

997
02:01:48,316 --> 02:01:51,528
Think of all the harm they've done!

998
02:01:51,611 --> 02:01:54,614
To you! To me!

999
02:01:54,698 --> 02:01:56,950
To humanity!

1000
02:01:57,075 --> 02:02:00,036
And know this...
that we can make them...

1001
02:02:00,120 --> 02:02:02,706
and their flags and their anthems
and their governments...

1002
02:02:02,747 --> 02:02:05,459
disappear in a flash!

1003
02:02:05,500 --> 02:02:07,668
You in me.

1004
02:02:07,710 --> 02:02:09,962
I'd rather die.

1005
02:02:10,087 --> 02:02:14,592
Oh, that's your answer?

1006
02:02:14,675 --> 02:02:18,971
Then indeed you shall die...
and be reborn...

1007
02:02:19,054 --> 02:02:22,475
a hero... of the kind
that walked the earth...

1008
02:02:22,558 --> 02:02:26,270
long before the pale religions
of civilization...

1009
02:02:26,353 --> 02:02:29,607
infected humanity's soul!

1010
02:02:29,690 --> 02:02:32,818
Go!

1011
02:02:46,290 --> 02:02:49,209
Stop your bawling,

1012
02:02:49,250 --> 02:02:52,670
you weak little speck
of human trash.

1013
02:02:59,135 --> 02:03:02,055
All right... I'll go!

1014
02:03:03,807 --> 02:03:06,476
- You just watch me go!
- Hit it.

1015
02:03:31,125 --> 02:03:34,211
- Hit it again!

1016
02:03:34,294 --> 02:03:38,090
We can't, sir. There's no power. Some
kind of counter-electromagnetic field.

1017
02:03:42,761 --> 02:03:45,222
Move in and assault the target.
Move in!

1018
02:03:45,305 --> 02:03:48,600
Move, move, move!

1019
02:04:36,981 --> 02:04:40,568
Sir, I've located them on radar.
Pear Lake.

1020
02:04:40,651 --> 02:04:43,029
Call up the task force.

1021
02:04:49,701 --> 02:04:52,037
Yes!

1022
02:05:56,475 --> 02:05:59,353
That's right. Keep fighting.

1023
02:05:59,436 --> 02:06:03,983
The more you fight,
the more of you I take.

1024
02:06:11,531 --> 02:06:16,494
Strange. We're reading a phenomenal
drop in temperatures there.

1025
02:06:16,536 --> 02:06:19,080
But simultaneous radiological activity.

1026
02:06:19,205 --> 02:06:22,375
They're absorbing
all the ambient energy.

1027
02:06:31,718 --> 02:06:35,889
Sleep now, Bruce, and forget forever.

1028
02:06:35,930 --> 02:06:40,894
Struggle no more...
and give me all of your power.

1029
02:06:42,729 --> 02:06:46,733
You think you can live with it? Take it!

1030
02:06:46,816 --> 02:06:50,486
Take it all!

1031
02:06:52,196 --> 02:06:55,616
Oh, yes! Yes!

1032
02:07:09,046 --> 02:07:12,424
Take it back!

1033
02:07:12,466 --> 02:07:16,303
It's not stopping!

1034
02:07:16,386 --> 02:07:18,639
Take it back!

1035
02:07:34,779 --> 02:07:37,532
Gentlemen... release.

1036
02:07:45,957 --> 02:07:48,960
Gamma charge away.

1037
02:08:10,397 --> 02:08:13,817
- Mwah!
- Sweet dreams.

1038
02:09:07,495 --> 02:09:10,456
- Hello?
- Betty, is that you?

1039
02:09:10,456 --> 02:09:13,000
- Hi, Dad.
- I'm glad I caught you.

1040
02:09:13,083 --> 02:09:16,045
- I'm glad you called.
- Thanks.

1041
02:09:17,713 --> 02:09:21,509
Look, Betty... you and I...

1042
02:09:21,550 --> 02:09:26,806
well, we both know that Bruce
couldn't have survived that blast.

1043
02:09:26,889 --> 02:09:31,017
But... well, you know...

1044
02:09:31,059 --> 02:09:34,062
- What is it?
- Well, you know.

1045
02:09:34,103 --> 02:09:37,649
The usual loonies.  Seein' things.

1046
02:09:37,732 --> 02:09:39,692
Only now everything's green.

1047
02:09:39,734 --> 02:09:43,404
Right.

1048
02:09:43,446 --> 02:09:46,491
Look, uh...

1049
02:09:46,533 --> 02:09:50,120
if by some chance
he did survive...

1050
02:09:50,245 --> 02:09:54,833
and he should try to contact you,
try to get in touch,

1051
02:09:54,916 --> 02:09:57,544
you'd tell me, wouldn't you?

1052
02:09:58,711 --> 02:10:02,549
No... I wouldn't.

1053
02:10:02,590 --> 02:10:06,219
But you know as well as I do,
I wouldn't have to.

1054
02:10:06,302 --> 02:10:09,805
I mean, my phones are bugged,
my computer's tapped.

1055
02:10:09,888 --> 02:10:12,057
I'm under surveillance.

1056
02:10:14,226 --> 02:10:16,937
I'll tell you, though,

1057
02:10:16,979 --> 02:10:19,064
that if he were alive,

1058
02:10:19,106 --> 02:10:22,276
I'm the last person
I would want him to come to...

1059
02:10:22,359 --> 02:10:25,737
because... as much as I miss him,

1060
02:10:25,863 --> 02:10:29,908
I... I... loved him.

1061
02:10:29,950 --> 02:10:32,995
I, um...

1062
02:10:33,120 --> 02:10:36,457
Yeah.

1063
02:10:36,498 --> 02:10:38,834
I'm sorry, Betty.

1064
02:10:41,170 --> 02:10:43,797
I am so sorry.

1065
02:10:46,091 --> 02:10:48,301
I know you are.

1066
02:11:24,712 --> 02:11:26,631
Si.

1067
02:11:37,808 --> 02:11:41,561
Let's take a walk.

1068
02:13:50,687 --> 02:13:54,024
