00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:42,039
When I was lying there in the VA hospital,

3
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:45,136
with a big hole blown through the middle of my life,

4
00:00:45,936 --> 00:00:48,436
I started having these dreams of flying.

5
00:00:49,806 --> 00:00:51,266
I was free.

6
00:00:54,486 --> 00:00:58,066
Sooner or later, though, you always have to wake up.

7
00:01:07,826 --> 00:01:10,786
They can fix a spinal, if you got the money,

8
00:01:10,836 --> 00:01:13,626
but not on vet benefits, not in this economy.

9
00:01:15,126 --> 00:01:17,836
A VA check and 12 bucks will get you a cup of coffee.

10
00:01:18,506 --> 00:01:20,676
I'm what they call... waitlisted.

11
00:01:29,726 --> 00:01:34,226
The Bengal Tiger, extinct for over a century is making a comeback.

12
00:01:34,316 --> 00:01:38,566
These cloned tiger cubs at the Beijing Zoo are the latest of a number of species

13
00:01:38,656 --> 00:01:42,486
that have been cloned back into existence in the past five years.

14
00:01:42,526 --> 00:01:47,786
I became a marine for the hardship. To be hammered on the anvil of life.

15
00:01:49,116 --> 00:01:52,496
I told myself I can pass any test a man can pass.

16
00:01:55,376 --> 00:02:00,836
Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake!

17
00:02:04,346 --> 00:02:06,676
Let's get it straight, upfront.

18
00:02:06,716 --> 00:02:08,176
I don't want your pity.

19
00:02:09,726 --> 00:02:12,436
You want a fair deal, you're on the wrong planet.

20
00:02:17,356 --> 00:02:18,856
The strong prey on the weak.

21
00:02:19,896 --> 00:02:21,276
That's just the way things are.

22
00:02:23,026 --> 00:02:24,656
And nobody does a damn thing.

23
00:02:42,336 --> 00:02:44,176
Get off! Get off of him!

24
00:02:44,846 --> 00:02:49,426
All I ever wanted in my sorry-ass life was a single thing worth fighting for.

25
00:03:04,446 --> 00:03:06,616
I hope you realized you just lost yourself a customer.

26
00:03:08,196 --> 00:03:10,366
Candy-ass bitch.

27
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,746
If it ain't raining, we ain't training.

28
00:03:28,466 --> 00:03:30,806
- It doesn't look like him. - It's him.

29
00:03:30,886 --> 00:03:33,136
You Jake Sully?

30
00:03:33,226 --> 00:03:35,476
Step off. You're ruining my good mood.

31
00:03:36,396 --> 00:03:37,516
It's about your brother.

32
00:03:44,776 --> 00:03:46,776
We're looking for Sully, T.

33
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:49,786
In there.

34
00:04:14,016 --> 00:04:15,476
Jesus, Tommy.

35
00:04:15,846 --> 00:04:17,686
The strong prey on the weak.

36
00:04:18,556 --> 00:04:20,936
A guy with a knife took all Tommy would ever be

37
00:04:21,816 --> 00:04:23,606
for the paper in his wallet.

38
00:04:25,446 --> 00:04:27,776
The concern of the suits was touching.

39
00:04:27,866 --> 00:04:31,366
Your brother represented a significant investment.

40
00:04:31,446 --> 00:04:33,906
We'd like to talk to you about taking over his contract.

41
00:04:33,996 --> 00:04:38,456
And since your genome is identical to his, you could step into his shoes,

42
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,036
so to speak.

43
00:04:41,876 --> 00:04:44,756
It'd be a fresh start on a new world.

44
00:04:45,046 --> 00:04:48,716
You could do something important. You can make a difference.

45
00:04:53,976 --> 00:04:55,886
And the pay is good.

46
00:04:56,516 --> 00:04:57,516
Very good.

47
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:00,646
Tommy was the scientist, not me.

48
00:05:01,266 --> 00:05:03,726
He was the one who wanted to get shot light-years out in space

49
00:05:03,776 --> 00:05:05,106
to find the answers.

50
00:05:10,066 --> 00:05:13,906
Me, I was just another dumb grunt getting sent someplace he was gonna regret.

51
00:05:46,396 --> 00:05:47,856
In cryo, you don't dream at all.

52
00:05:48,986 --> 00:05:51,066
It doesn't feel like six years.

53
00:05:51,116 --> 00:05:54,446
More like a fifth of tequila and an ass-kicking.

54
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,126
Are we there yet?

55
00:06:09,376 --> 00:06:11,466
Yeah, we're there, sunshine.

56
00:06:11,796 --> 00:06:13,386
We're there.

57
00:06:13,886 --> 00:06:17,636
You've been in cryo for five years, nine months and 22 days.

58
00:06:17,676 --> 00:06:20,516
You will be hungry. You will be weak.

59
00:06:20,596 --> 00:06:25,686
If you feel nausea, please use the sacks provided for your convenience.

60
00:06:26,026 --> 00:06:28,986
The staff thanks you in advance.

61
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:44,666
Up ahead was Pandora.

62
00:06:46,046 --> 00:06:50,006
You grew up hearing about it, but I never figured I'd be going there.

63
00:07:08,936 --> 00:07:11,776
Valkyrie 1-6, copy...

64
00:07:11,986 --> 00:07:15,616
Valkyrie 1-6, you are clear for de-orbit burn at 2-2-4-niner.

65
00:07:15,906 --> 00:07:20,196
Copy, Venture Star. Go for de-orbit burn at 2-2-4-niner.

66
00:07:39,266 --> 00:07:42,676
- Exo-packs on! Let's go! Exo-packs on! - Exo-packs on! Let's go!

67
00:07:42,726 --> 00:07:44,096
Remember, people, you lose that mask,

68
00:07:44,186 --> 00:07:47,896
you're unconscious in 20 seconds, you're dead in four minutes!

69
00:07:47,936 --> 00:07:51,276
Let's nobody be dead today! Looks very bad on my report.

70
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:55,736
Hell's Gate tower, this is TAV 1-6 on approach.

71
00:07:55,816 --> 00:07:57,616
Crossing outer marker. Mine is in sight.

72
00:08:40,076 --> 00:08:42,406
Harnesses off! Get your packs!

73
00:08:42,446 --> 00:08:45,956
- Put it together, let's go! Let's go! - Harnesses off! One minute!

74
00:08:45,996 --> 00:08:49,996
When that ramp comes down, go directly into the base. Do not stop!

75
00:08:50,086 --> 00:08:52,626
Go straight inside. Wait for my mark!

76
00:08:59,136 --> 00:09:03,006
Go, go, go, go! Get out of there! Keep moving! Let's go, let's go!

77
00:09:13,146 --> 00:09:15,186
There's no such thing as an ex-Marine.

78
00:09:16,236 --> 00:09:19,276
You may be out, but you never lose the attitude.

79
00:09:29,956 --> 00:09:32,836
Let's go, special case! Do not make me wait for you!

80
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,666
Well, well, ladies.

81
00:09:36,086 --> 00:09:37,836
Look at all this fresh meat!

82
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:47,846
Back on Earth, these guys were Army dogs, Marines,

83
00:09:47,936 --> 00:09:49,476
fighting for freedom.

84
00:09:56,186 --> 00:09:57,686
Look out, hot rod!

85
00:09:59,106 --> 00:10:01,026
But out here they're just hired guns,

86
00:10:01,116 --> 00:10:03,986
taking the money, working for the company.

87
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:05,446
Check this out, man.

88
00:10:06,036 --> 00:10:07,536
Meals on wheels.

89
00:10:08,866 --> 00:10:11,746
Oh, man, that is just wrong.

90
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:13,706
I got two guys free in about 20 minutes!

91
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,336
Got it! Need them!

92
00:10:24,596 --> 00:10:26,886
You're not in Kansas anymore.

93
00:10:29,306 --> 00:10:33,226
You are on Pandora, ladies and gentlemen.

94
00:10:33,306 --> 00:10:37,066
Respect that fact every second of every day.

95
00:10:39,316 --> 00:10:40,946
If there is a hell,

96
00:10:41,696 --> 00:10:46,326
you might want to go there for some R&R after a tour on Pandora.

97
00:10:47,156 --> 00:10:49,326
Out there, beyond that fence,

98
00:10:49,406 --> 00:10:53,746
every living thing that crawls, flies or squats in the mud

99
00:10:53,826 --> 00:10:56,996
wants to kill you and eat your eyes for Jujubes.

100
00:10:58,876 --> 00:11:03,716
We have an indigenous population of humanoids called the Na'vi.

101
00:11:03,716 --> 00:11:06,096
They're fond of arrows dipped in a neurotoxin

102
00:11:06,176 --> 00:11:09,016
that'll stop your heart in one minute.

103
00:11:09,016 --> 00:11:13,396
And they have bones reinforced with naturally occurring carbon fiber.

104
00:11:14,016 --> 00:11:15,856
They are very hard to kill.

105
00:11:17,316 --> 00:11:21,316
As head of security, it is my job to keep you alive.

106
00:11:23,236 --> 00:11:25,026
I will not succeed.

107
00:11:27,196 --> 00:11:28,616
Not with all of you.

108
00:11:29,696 --> 00:11:31,746
If you wish to survive,

109
00:11:31,826 --> 00:11:34,706
you need to cultivate a strong mental attitude.

110
00:11:35,496 --> 00:11:37,706
You've got to obey the rules.

111
00:11:38,496 --> 00:11:40,506
Pandora rules.

112
00:11:41,756 --> 00:11:43,466
Rule number one...

113
00:11:43,546 --> 00:11:47,006
There's nothing like an old-school safety brief to put your mind at ease.

114
00:11:49,346 --> 00:11:54,886
Excuse me. Excuse me. Jake! You're Jake, right? Tom's brother.

115
00:11:55,556 --> 00:11:57,806
Wow! You look just like him.

116
00:11:57,896 --> 00:12:01,646
Sorry, I'm Norm. Spellman. I went through avatar training with him.

117
00:12:01,736 --> 00:12:03,736
...into the bio-lab.

118
00:12:04,446 --> 00:12:08,986
We're gonna spend a lot of time up here. Hey! How you doing? Norm, avatar driver.

119
00:12:09,076 --> 00:12:10,326
- Hi. - Hey.

120
00:12:10,406 --> 00:12:11,996
Link... Here's the link room right here.

121
00:12:12,076 --> 00:12:14,366
This is where we're connecting to the avatar.

122
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,286
Me and Norm are here to drive

123
00:12:18,286 --> 00:12:21,496
these remotely controlled bodies called avatars.

124
00:12:21,586 --> 00:12:26,586
And they're grown from human DNA mixed with the DNA of the natives.

125
00:12:26,676 --> 00:12:28,636
- Hey. Welcome. - Hey.

126
00:12:28,716 --> 00:12:31,096
- Welcome to Pandora. Good to have you. - Thanks.

127
00:12:33,096 --> 00:12:34,976
Damn! They got big.

128
00:12:35,056 --> 00:12:37,596
Yeah, they fully mature on the flight out.

129
00:12:37,686 --> 00:12:40,016
So the proprioceptive sims seem to work really well.

130
00:12:40,106 --> 00:12:41,976
Yeah, they've got great muscle tone.

131
00:12:42,066 --> 00:12:43,986
It'll take us a few hours to get them decanted,

132
00:12:43,986 --> 00:12:45,946
but you guys can take them out tomorrow.

133
00:12:46,446 --> 00:12:47,816
There's yours.

134
00:12:49,486 --> 00:12:51,156
Hey. Dr. Norm Spellman.

135
00:12:51,156 --> 00:12:54,076
- Dr. Max Patel. Great to meet you. - Good to meet you, yeah.

136
00:13:17,976 --> 00:13:19,476
Looks like him.

137
00:13:20,726 --> 00:13:22,566
No, it looks like you.

138
00:13:23,646 --> 00:13:25,606
This is your avatar now, Jake.

139
00:13:28,856 --> 00:13:33,236
And the concept is that every driver is matched to his own avatar,

140
00:13:34,326 --> 00:13:36,116
so that their nervous systems are in tune,

141
00:13:37,496 --> 00:13:38,956
or something.

142
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:44,706
Which is why they offered me the gig, because I can link with Tommy's avatar,

143
00:13:45,756 --> 00:13:47,626
which is insanely expensive.

144
00:13:48,376 --> 00:13:51,836
Is this right? I just say whatever to the video log?

145
00:13:51,926 --> 00:13:54,096
Yeah, we gotta get in the habit of documenting everything.

146
00:13:54,176 --> 00:13:56,216
You know, what we see, what we feel.

147
00:13:56,306 --> 00:13:59,016
- It's all part of the science. - And good science is good observation.

148
00:13:59,096 --> 00:14:01,556
Plus it'll help to keep you sane for the next six years.

149
00:14:01,556 --> 00:14:04,396
All right. Whatever.

150
00:14:06,356 --> 00:14:08,026
So...

151
00:14:09,066 --> 00:14:10,526
Well, here I am,

152
00:14:12,196 --> 00:14:13,696
doing science.

153
00:14:14,866 --> 00:14:16,446
They're coming out!

154
00:14:16,536 --> 00:14:19,036
Attention. Drivers coming out of link.

155
00:14:26,206 --> 00:14:27,706
Oh, God.

156
00:14:29,586 --> 00:14:31,376
Where's the lab coat? Where's the lab coat?

157
00:14:31,386 --> 00:14:37,766
Who's got my goddamn cigarette? Guys! What's wrong with this picture?

158
00:14:38,886 --> 00:14:42,306
- Thank you! - Grace Augustine is a legend.

159
00:14:42,396 --> 00:14:44,896
She's the head of the Avatar Program. She wrote the book,

160
00:14:44,976 --> 00:14:47,776
I mean, literally wrote the book on Pandoran botany.

161
00:14:47,776 --> 00:14:50,066
Well, that's 'cause she likes plants better than people.

162
00:14:50,606 --> 00:14:52,446
Here she is, Cinderella back from the ball.

163
00:14:52,566 --> 00:14:56,236
Grace, I'd like you to meet Norm Spellman and Jake Sully.

164
00:14:57,996 --> 00:15:01,706
Norm. I hear good things about you. How's your Na'vi?

165
00:15:02,746 --> 00:15:04,996
May the All Mother...

166
00:15:04,996 --> 00:15:07,206
...smile upon our first meeting.

167
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:10,416
Not bad. You sound a little formal.

168
00:15:11,586 --> 00:15:13,886
I studied for five years...

169
00:15:13,886 --> 00:15:15,966
...but there is much to learn.

170
00:15:16,176 --> 00:15:19,676
- Grace? This is Jake Sully. - Ma'am.

171
00:15:20,226 --> 00:15:24,266
Yeah, yeah. I know who you are, and I don't need you. I need your brother.

172
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:27,976
You know, the PhD who trained for three years for this mission?

173
00:15:28,066 --> 00:15:29,476
He's dead.

174
00:15:30,186 --> 00:15:32,526
I know it's a big inconvenience for everyone.

175
00:15:33,606 --> 00:15:36,946
- How much lab training have you had? - I dissected a frog once.

176
00:15:38,326 --> 00:15:41,536
You see? You see? I mean, they're just pissing on us

177
00:15:41,616 --> 00:15:43,996
without even the courtesy of calling it rain.

178
00:15:43,996 --> 00:15:45,326
- I'm going to Selfridge. - No, Grace,

179
00:15:45,326 --> 00:15:47,956
- I don't think that's a good idea. - No, man, this is such bullshit!

180
00:15:48,046 --> 00:15:49,456
I'm gonna kick his corporate butt.

181
00:15:49,546 --> 00:15:52,416
He has no business sticking his nose in my department.

182
00:15:53,466 --> 00:15:57,256
Here tomorrow, 0800. Try and use big words.

183
00:16:05,556 --> 00:16:09,516
Scorpion Two-Hotel, Hell's Gate tower. You are cleared for south departure.

184
00:16:09,526 --> 00:16:12,396
Hover taxi, Delta runway. Squawk ident.

185
00:16:18,276 --> 00:16:19,486
- You see that? - Yes, sir.

186
00:16:19,576 --> 00:16:21,656
No, you didn't. You were looking at the monitor.

187
00:16:21,746 --> 00:16:24,656
I love this putter, Ronnie! I love this putter.

188
00:16:27,536 --> 00:16:31,836
Parker, you know, I used to think it was benign neglect,

189
00:16:31,836 --> 00:16:34,876
but now I see that you're intentionally screwing me.

190
00:16:34,876 --> 00:16:38,466
Grace, you know, I enjoy our little talks.

191
00:16:42,846 --> 00:16:46,346
I need a researcher. Not some jarhead dropout.

192
00:16:46,346 --> 00:16:48,016
Well, actually, I thought we got lucky with him.

193
00:16:48,106 --> 00:16:49,686
- Lucky? - Yeah.

194
00:16:49,686 --> 00:16:51,726
How is this in any way lucky?

195
00:16:51,816 --> 00:16:53,566
Lucky your guy had a twin brother,

196
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:56,566
and lucky that brother wasn't some oral hygienist or something.

197
00:16:56,906 --> 00:16:58,566
A Marine we can use.

198
00:16:58,656 --> 00:17:00,576
I'm assigning him to your team as security escort.

199
00:17:00,576 --> 00:17:04,036
The last thing I need is another trigger-happy moron out there!

200
00:17:04,116 --> 00:17:06,076
Look, look, you're supposed to be winning the hearts

201
00:17:06,076 --> 00:17:07,206
and the minds of the natives.

202
00:17:07,206 --> 00:17:09,076
Isn't that the whole point of your little puppet show?

203
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,706
If you look like them and you talk like them,

204
00:17:10,706 --> 00:17:12,416
then they'll start trusting us.

205
00:17:12,496 --> 00:17:14,546
We build them a school, we teach them English,

206
00:17:14,546 --> 00:17:16,586
but after, what, how many years?

207
00:17:16,676 --> 00:17:18,256
Relations with the indigenous are only getting worse.

208
00:17:18,256 --> 00:17:21,596
Yeah, that tends to happen when you use machine guns on them.

209
00:17:21,596 --> 00:17:23,716
Right. Come here.

210
00:17:24,806 --> 00:17:26,556
I can't... I can't...

211
00:17:29,806 --> 00:17:32,766
This is why we're here. Unobtanium.

212
00:17:32,856 --> 00:17:35,936
Because this little gray rock sells for 20 million a kilo.

213
00:17:36,026 --> 00:17:39,236
That's the only reason. It's what pays for the whole party.

214
00:17:39,316 --> 00:17:41,236
It's what pays for your science.

215
00:17:42,616 --> 00:17:45,786
Now, those savages are threatening our whole operation,

216
00:17:45,786 --> 00:17:47,116
we're on the brink of war,

217
00:17:47,116 --> 00:17:50,416
and you're supposed to be finding a diplomatic solution.

218
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:53,956
So use what you've got, and get me some results.

219
00:18:04,846 --> 00:18:07,426
So, how much link time have you logged?

220
00:18:07,426 --> 00:18:11,146
- About 520 hours. - That's good.

221
00:18:11,146 --> 00:18:15,526
You're in there. You're here. How much have you logged?

222
00:18:15,606 --> 00:18:18,276
Zip. But I read a manual.

223
00:18:19,236 --> 00:18:21,276
Tell me you're joking.

224
00:18:22,616 --> 00:18:23,986
This is cool.

225
00:18:24,446 --> 00:18:25,866
Let's go.

226
00:18:29,786 --> 00:18:31,496
Don't. I got this.

227
00:18:35,876 --> 00:18:38,506
So you just figured you'd come out here,

228
00:18:38,506 --> 00:18:41,126
to the most hostile environment known to man,

229
00:18:41,216 --> 00:18:44,966
with no training of any kind, and see how it went?

230
00:18:45,056 --> 00:18:47,386
What was going through your head?

231
00:18:47,466 --> 00:18:50,306
Maybe I was sick of doctors telling me what I couldn't do.

232
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,686
- Biometrics are good. - Link three is ready.

233
00:18:54,146 --> 00:18:58,436
Keep your arms in, hands in, head down.

234
00:18:59,566 --> 00:19:03,316
Down. Just relax and let your mind go blank.

235
00:19:04,026 --> 00:19:05,986
That shouldn't be hard for you.

236
00:19:05,986 --> 00:19:07,826
Kiss the darkest part of my lily white...

237
00:19:07,906 --> 00:19:09,366
Initiate link.

238
00:19:10,156 --> 00:19:12,706
Run sequence unit three. Go.

239
00:19:12,706 --> 00:19:14,166
Launching.

240
00:19:19,586 --> 00:19:21,086
I have the first congruency.

241
00:19:29,516 --> 00:19:35,056
- That's a gorgeous brain. Nice activity. - Go figure.

242
00:19:35,056 --> 00:19:37,056
Phase-Iock 40%.

243
00:19:41,026 --> 00:19:42,606
All right. Going in.

244
00:19:43,236 --> 00:19:44,816
I'm going in in four.

245
00:19:47,866 --> 00:19:50,486
Phase-Iock 99%. Link is stable.

246
00:20:05,336 --> 00:20:11,266
He's in. Jake, can you hear me? Can you hear me, Jake?

247
00:20:11,266 --> 00:20:12,886
Pupillary reflex is good.

248
00:20:15,646 --> 00:20:18,686
Pinna response normal. How you feeling, Jake?

249
00:20:19,396 --> 00:20:20,776
Hey, guys.

250
00:20:21,646 --> 00:20:23,436
Welcome to your new body, Jake.

251
00:20:23,446 --> 00:20:24,896
Good!

252
00:20:24,906 --> 00:20:26,406
Yeah, we're gonna take this nice and easy, Jake.

253
00:20:26,486 --> 00:20:28,616
- And touch your thumb to your fingers. - Yeah.

254
00:20:28,696 --> 00:20:30,076
- Thumb to your fingers. - No problem.

255
00:20:30,156 --> 00:20:31,736
That's good. I can see you can remember that one.

256
00:20:31,826 --> 00:20:33,996
- Got it. - Well, if you want to sit up,

257
00:20:34,076 --> 00:20:35,406
- that's fine. - Okay, good. Just take it

258
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:38,416
nice and slow, Jake. Good. Okay, well, no truncal ataxia, that's good.

259
00:20:38,496 --> 00:20:41,996
Are you feeling lightheaded or dizzy at all? You're wiggling your toes!

260
00:20:42,086 --> 00:20:43,836
- Good. Good, Jake. - That's great.

261
00:20:45,376 --> 00:20:48,426
Distal motor control is good. Good, Jake.

262
00:20:48,506 --> 00:20:51,176
Are you feeling any numbness or pain?

263
00:20:52,516 --> 00:20:53,806
That's great, Jake. Hold on, now.

264
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:56,136
Take it easy. Don't get ahead of yourself, okay?

265
00:20:56,226 --> 00:20:58,806
There's a few more sensory motor reflex tests we need to run,

266
00:20:58,806 --> 00:21:00,976
- so take it easy. - Wait.

267
00:21:00,976 --> 00:21:02,476
- Jake. - Sit down, Jake.

268
00:21:02,566 --> 00:21:04,936
Jake! Listen to me. Jake!

269
00:21:05,606 --> 00:21:07,276
- I need you to sit down. Jake! - It's okay.

270
00:21:07,356 --> 00:21:09,156
- Buddy, listen to me. - It's all good. I got this.

271
00:21:09,236 --> 00:21:12,946
- Jake, you need to sit down right now. - Guys, get him back on the gurney now.

272
00:21:12,946 --> 00:21:15,156
Listen to me. For your own safety, you need to sit down.

273
00:21:15,156 --> 00:21:17,996
You need time to adjust to the avatar... Whoa! Jake!

274
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:20,326
- God, Jake, watch your tail. - Yeah!

275
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:24,506
Sedate! Sedate him! A thousand milligrams of Supitocam! Stat!

276
00:21:24,586 --> 00:21:26,876
Guys! Guys! Whoa! Whoa!

277
00:21:26,966 --> 00:21:27,966
By the numbers.

278
00:21:28,046 --> 00:21:29,466
- Jake. Come on. - Jake! Listen to me.

279
00:21:29,546 --> 00:21:31,136
You're not used to your avatar body.

280
00:21:31,216 --> 00:21:32,966
- This is dangerous. - This is great.

281
00:21:32,966 --> 00:21:36,266
- Jake? Jake, listen to me. - Come on. They're gonna put you out.

282
00:21:38,806 --> 00:21:41,476
- Norm, sit down. - No, no. I gotta get out of these leads.

283
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:43,146
God damn it! Bring them home!

284
00:21:43,226 --> 00:21:45,896
- Norm! Do not leave control! - You're not ready for it!

285
00:21:47,646 --> 00:21:51,486
- Oh, come on, you ain't got no skills. - So close!

286
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:53,156
I don't even have to play defense on it.

287
00:21:53,236 --> 00:21:54,736
Hey, guys. Hey.

288
00:21:54,826 --> 00:21:57,156
- It's okay, I'll get him. - Jake, you have to come back!

289
00:21:57,156 --> 00:21:58,996
Jake! Jake! Excuse me.

290
00:22:01,536 --> 00:22:03,166
- Watch it! - Sorry!

291
00:22:03,246 --> 00:22:04,666
Come on!

292
00:22:05,796 --> 00:22:08,666
Jake! We're not supposed to be running!

293
00:22:18,186 --> 00:22:20,596
- Jeez! Sorry. - Watch it!

294
00:22:42,876 --> 00:22:44,376
Hey, Marine!

295
00:22:45,206 --> 00:22:46,626
Damn.

296
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:51,836
- Grace? - Well, who'd you expect, numbnuts?

297
00:22:53,046 --> 00:22:54,596
Think fast.

298
00:22:55,386 --> 00:22:57,596
Motor control's looking good.

299
00:23:07,476 --> 00:23:11,816
Come on, everybody, quiet down! All right, gang, lights out.

300
00:23:12,486 --> 00:23:14,066
Come on, Louise, chop-chop.

301
00:23:14,066 --> 00:23:15,566
Hey, hey, hey!

302
00:23:16,076 --> 00:23:18,286
Don't play with that, you'll go blind.

303
00:23:18,366 --> 00:23:19,906
That's kind of freaky.

304
00:23:19,906 --> 00:23:22,406
Come on. Scat.

305
00:23:23,326 --> 00:23:24,746
Good night.

306
00:23:26,456 --> 00:23:29,586
Lights out! See you at dinner, kiddies.

307
00:23:53,606 --> 00:23:54,656
Welcome back.

308
00:24:02,616 --> 00:24:04,956
- You okay? You all right? - Yeah, I'm okay.

309
00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:11,956
I'm Trudy. I fly all the science sorties. And this here is my baby.

310
00:24:12,546 --> 00:24:14,176
Hold on a second.

311
00:24:14,716 --> 00:24:17,636
Hey, Wainfleet! Get it done!

312
00:24:18,046 --> 00:24:22,176
- We bounce at zero-nine. - Yeah, I'm on it, capitaine!

313
00:24:22,886 --> 00:24:24,846
Vine strike's still loose.

314
00:24:24,936 --> 00:24:27,186
You guys are packing some heavy gear.

315
00:24:27,186 --> 00:24:28,556
Watch it!

316
00:24:29,186 --> 00:24:31,856
Yeah, that's 'cause we're not the only thing flying around out there.

317
00:24:31,936 --> 00:24:33,686
Or the biggest.

318
00:24:33,696 --> 00:24:36,526
I'm gonna need you on a door gun. I'm a man short.

319
00:24:36,616 --> 00:24:38,446
I thought you'd never ask.

320
00:24:39,776 --> 00:24:42,946
There's your man. See you on the flight line.

321
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:56,046
You wanted to see me, Colonel?

322
00:24:56,126 --> 00:24:58,756
This low gravity'll make you soft.

323
00:25:00,176 --> 00:25:01,716
You get soft,

324
00:25:04,976 --> 00:25:08,266
Pandora will shit you out dead with zero warning.

325
00:25:09,356 --> 00:25:11,896
I pulled your record, Corporal.

326
00:25:11,976 --> 00:25:14,396
Venezuela, that was some mean bush.

327
00:25:16,356 --> 00:25:18,696
Nothing like this here, though.

328
00:25:20,946 --> 00:25:24,366
You got some heart, kid, showing up in this neighborhood.

329
00:25:24,366 --> 00:25:26,286
I figured it's just another hellhole.

330
00:25:26,366 --> 00:25:28,786
I was First Recon myself.

331
00:25:28,876 --> 00:25:32,086
A few years ahead of you. Well, maybe more than a few.

332
00:25:33,046 --> 00:25:35,966
Three tours Nigeria, not a scratch.

333
00:25:36,046 --> 00:25:37,506
I come out here?

334
00:25:38,296 --> 00:25:41,546
Day one. Think I felt like a shavetail louie?

335
00:25:41,636 --> 00:25:46,226
Yeah. They could fix me up, if I rotated back.

336
00:25:46,886 --> 00:25:51,976
Yeah, and make me pretty again. But you know what? I kind of like it.

337
00:25:52,066 --> 00:25:54,896
It reminds me every day what's waiting out there.

338
00:25:56,896 --> 00:26:02,826
The Avatar Program is a bad joke. Bunch of limp-dick science majors.

339
00:26:02,906 --> 00:26:09,916
However, it does present an opportunity both timely and unique.

340
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:11,576
- Clear! - Clear!

341
00:26:16,756 --> 00:26:21,966
A recon gyrene in an avatar body. That's a potent mix.

342
00:26:21,966 --> 00:26:23,636
Give me the goose bumps.

343
00:26:23,716 --> 00:26:27,136
Such a Marine could provide the intel I need,

344
00:26:27,226 --> 00:26:28,926
right on the ground.

345
00:26:30,226 --> 00:26:32,146
Right in the hostiles' camp.

346
00:26:32,936 --> 00:26:38,276
Look, Sully. I want you to learn these savages from the inside.

347
00:26:38,356 --> 00:26:40,106
I want you to gain their trust.

348
00:26:40,106 --> 00:26:41,946
I need to know how to force their cooperation

349
00:26:41,946 --> 00:26:44,486
or hammer them hard if they won't.

350
00:26:45,946 --> 00:26:48,286
- Am I still with Augustine? - On paper.

351
00:26:48,286 --> 00:26:52,456
Yeah, you walk like one of her science pukes, you quack like one,

352
00:26:53,956 --> 00:26:55,536
but you report to me.

353
00:26:56,956 --> 00:26:58,756
Can you do that for me, son?

354
00:27:00,296 --> 00:27:01,676
Hell, yeah, sir.

355
00:27:02,586 --> 00:27:04,386
Well, all right, then.

356
00:27:15,396 --> 00:27:18,356
Son, I take care of my own.

357
00:27:18,356 --> 00:27:19,486
You get me what I need,

358
00:27:19,566 --> 00:27:22,816
I'll see to it you get your legs back when you rotate home.

359
00:27:23,696 --> 00:27:25,196
Your real legs.

360
00:27:27,866 --> 00:27:29,996
That sounds real good, sir.

361
00:27:36,626 --> 00:27:39,336
- Link's ready! - Phase-Iock 40%.

362
00:27:39,956 --> 00:27:43,046
Just keep your mouth shut and let Norm do the talking.

363
00:27:43,126 --> 00:27:46,676
I have five congruencies. Phase-Iock 90%.

364
00:27:46,756 --> 00:27:48,096
Link three ready.

365
00:27:48,766 --> 00:27:50,426
All right, I'm going in.

366
00:28:22,336 --> 00:28:24,586
Sturmbeest herd coming up on your right.

367
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:26,466
Got it! Thanks.

368
00:28:27,466 --> 00:28:31,056
Looks like a bull, a dozen cows and some juveniles.

369
00:29:19,146 --> 00:29:21,516
Shut it down. We're gonna stay a while.

370
00:29:24,986 --> 00:29:28,776
- Norm! Your pack. - Pack.

371
00:29:31,406 --> 00:29:35,406
Stay with the ship. One idiot with a gun is enough.

372
00:29:37,826 --> 00:29:39,496
You the man, Doc.

373
00:30:16,076 --> 00:30:19,206
Prolemuris. They're not aggressive.

374
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:25,246
Relax, Marine. You're making me nervous.

375
00:30:30,796 --> 00:30:33,426
So, how will they know we're here?

376
00:30:33,466 --> 00:30:36,176
I'm sure they're watching us right now.

377
00:30:40,266 --> 00:30:42,266
This was our school.

378
00:30:42,306 --> 00:30:45,606
Now it's just... storage.

379
00:30:46,436 --> 00:30:48,356
The kids were so bright.

380
00:30:49,066 --> 00:30:50,276
Eager to learn.

381
00:30:50,446 --> 00:30:52,856
They picked up English faster than I could teach it.

382
00:30:54,326 --> 00:30:57,286
So, we'll take a couple of these Ph monitors...

383
00:30:57,576 --> 00:30:59,496
...and a soil probe.

384
00:31:00,156 --> 00:31:05,036
That little yellow case back there. The old microscope.

385
00:31:06,086 --> 00:31:07,166
Here.

386
00:31:07,256 --> 00:31:08,836
Oh, yeah. I love this one.

387
00:31:09,376 --> 00:31:11,046
The stingbats knocked them down.

388
00:31:19,136 --> 00:31:22,346
I keep hoping someone will come back in and read them.

389
00:31:22,436 --> 00:31:24,146
Why don't they come back?

390
00:31:26,066 --> 00:31:32,236
The Omaticaya... learned as much about us as they needed to.

391
00:31:37,326 --> 00:31:38,576
What happened here?

392
00:31:42,536 --> 00:31:45,536
Are you going to help us with this gear? We've got a lot to do.

393
00:32:00,136 --> 00:32:02,096
- Keep moving, Norm. - Keep up, guys!

394
00:32:04,516 --> 00:32:08,106
- And here I go. - Scanning.

395
00:32:10,526 --> 00:32:13,696
Wow! It's that fast?

396
00:32:15,946 --> 00:32:18,026
- Amazing, isn't it? - Yeah.

397
00:32:18,116 --> 00:32:21,906
So, that is signal transduction from this root

398
00:32:21,996 --> 00:32:25,616
to the root of the tree next to it. So, we should take a sample.

399
00:32:25,706 --> 00:32:27,376
Okay. Sample.

400
00:32:29,416 --> 00:32:33,716
You know, it's probably electrical, based on the speed of the reaction.

401
00:32:34,376 --> 00:32:38,346
Norm, you've contaminated the sample with your saliva.

402
00:32:38,806 --> 00:32:40,596
Right.

403
00:33:08,376 --> 00:33:10,246
So, here I go.

404
00:33:35,736 --> 00:33:39,566
Don't shoot. Don't shoot, you'll piss him off.

405
00:33:43,326 --> 00:33:44,906
It's already pissed off.

406
00:33:45,116 --> 00:33:48,036
Jake, that armor's too thick. Trust me.

407
00:33:53,876 --> 00:33:57,966
It's a territorial threat display. Do not run, or he'll charge.

408
00:33:58,586 --> 00:34:00,386
So, what do I do, dance with it?

409
00:34:00,846 --> 00:34:03,926
Just hold your ground.

410
00:34:19,026 --> 00:34:21,406
Yeah? Come on! What you got?

411
00:34:22,526 --> 00:34:24,486
Oh, yeah. Who's bad? That's right.

412
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:27,906
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about, bitch.

413
00:34:29,456 --> 00:34:32,036
That's right, get your punk ass back to mommy.

414
00:34:32,126 --> 00:34:35,046
Yeah? Yeah, you got nothing. You keep running.

415
00:34:35,126 --> 00:34:38,126
Yeah, and why don't you bring back some of your friends, huh?

416
00:34:41,216 --> 00:34:42,336
Oh, shit.

417
00:34:54,146 --> 00:34:56,646
So what about this one? Run? Don't run? What?

418
00:34:58,066 --> 00:35:00,106
Run! Definitely run!

419
00:38:46,586 --> 00:38:47,876
I'm gonna have to call it, guys.

420
00:38:47,966 --> 00:38:50,876
We're not allowed to run night ops. Colonel's orders.

421
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:55,926
I'm sorry, Doc, he's just gonna have to hang on till morning.

422
00:38:55,926 --> 00:38:57,556
He won't make it till morning.

423
00:40:50,456 --> 00:40:52,416
I don't have all goddamn night.

424
00:40:53,256 --> 00:40:55,336
Come on! Come on!

425
00:42:09,286 --> 00:42:10,916
Hey, wait. Don't!

426
00:42:14,416 --> 00:42:15,546
Great.

427
00:43:13,016 --> 00:43:16,566
Look, I know you probably don't understand this,

428
00:43:22,656 --> 00:43:23,906
but thank you.

429
00:43:29,036 --> 00:43:30,496
Thank you.

430
00:43:34,456 --> 00:43:35,956
That was pretty impressive.

431
00:43:38,666 --> 00:43:41,626
I would have been screwed if you hadn't come along. It was...

432
00:43:45,176 --> 00:43:48,306
Hey, wait a second. Hey, where you going?

433
00:43:49,306 --> 00:43:50,766
Wait up!

434
00:43:51,516 --> 00:43:53,346
Just... Hey, slow down.

435
00:43:53,346 --> 00:43:56,436
Look, wait up, I just wanted to say thanks for killing those things.

436
00:43:57,516 --> 00:44:00,566
- Damn! - Don't thank.

437
00:44:01,486 --> 00:44:03,856
You don't thank for this.

438
00:44:05,406 --> 00:44:09,366
This is sad. Very sad only.

439
00:44:10,286 --> 00:44:12,366
Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.

440
00:44:13,206 --> 00:44:15,036
Whatever I did, I am sorry.

441
00:44:18,546 --> 00:44:21,706
All this is your fault. They did not need to die.

442
00:44:22,546 --> 00:44:24,626
My fault? They attacked me. How am I the bad guy?

443
00:44:24,716 --> 00:44:26,386
Your fault!

444
00:44:26,846 --> 00:44:29,556
- Your fault! - Easy. Easy.

445
00:44:29,636 --> 00:44:33,386
You're like a baby. Making noise, don't know what to do.

446
00:44:33,386 --> 00:44:34,886
Easy.

447
00:44:37,146 --> 00:44:39,566
Fine. Fine.

448
00:44:40,726 --> 00:44:42,856
If you love your little forest friends,

449
00:44:44,396 --> 00:44:46,236
why not let them just kill my ass?

450
00:44:47,236 --> 00:44:49,026
What's the thinking?

451
00:44:49,826 --> 00:44:52,536
- Why save you? - Yeah. Yeah, why save me?

452
00:44:56,956 --> 00:44:58,916
You have a strong heart.

453
00:45:01,046 --> 00:45:02,256
No fear.

454
00:45:06,756 --> 00:45:09,636
But stupid! Ignorant like a child.

455
00:45:16,056 --> 00:45:18,476
Well, if I'm like a child, then...

456
00:45:19,146 --> 00:45:21,356
Look, maybe you should teach me.

457
00:45:21,436 --> 00:45:23,646
Sky People cannot learn. You do not See.

458
00:45:23,736 --> 00:45:25,646
Well, then teach me how to See.

459
00:45:25,646 --> 00:45:28,196
- No one can teach you to See. - Whoa.

460
00:45:29,486 --> 00:45:31,946
Look, come on, can't we talk?

461
00:45:32,906 --> 00:45:36,786
Say, where'd you learn to speak English? Dr. Augustine's school?

462
00:45:41,626 --> 00:45:42,456
You're like a baby.

463
00:45:49,506 --> 00:45:51,136
I need your help.

464
00:45:52,176 --> 00:45:54,096
You should not be here.

465
00:45:55,016 --> 00:45:57,846
- Okay, take me with you. - No! Go back.

466
00:46:00,516 --> 00:46:01,556
No.

467
00:46:03,066 --> 00:46:04,316
Go back.

468
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:26,956
No!

469
00:46:48,736 --> 00:46:49,946
What...

470
00:46:53,696 --> 00:46:55,196
What are they?

471
00:46:56,536 --> 00:46:58,536
Seeds of the Sacred Tree.

472
00:46:59,576 --> 00:47:01,246
Very pure spirits.

473
00:47:25,356 --> 00:47:27,316
What was that all about?

474
00:47:29,396 --> 00:47:30,526
Come.

475
00:47:31,946 --> 00:47:33,066
Come!

476
00:47:35,236 --> 00:47:36,576
Where are we going?

477
00:47:47,086 --> 00:47:48,166
Come.

478
00:48:03,306 --> 00:48:05,056
What's your name?

479
00:48:05,146 --> 00:48:06,226
Shit!

480
00:48:31,716 --> 00:48:32,836
Okay.

481
00:48:35,546 --> 00:48:38,426
Calm people, calm.

482
00:48:44,186 --> 00:48:47,016
What are you doing, Tsu'tey?

483
00:48:49,476 --> 00:48:52,396
These demons are forbidden here.

484
00:48:53,196 --> 00:48:55,526
There has been a sign.

485
00:48:55,526 --> 00:48:57,866
This is a matter for the Tsahik.

486
00:49:02,696 --> 00:49:03,696
Bring him.

487
00:49:05,206 --> 00:49:06,786
What's going on?

488
00:49:09,126 --> 00:49:10,246
Wait.

489
00:49:13,216 --> 00:49:14,836
What's happening?

490
00:49:15,716 --> 00:49:16,716
Hey!

491
00:50:26,906 --> 00:50:28,246
Father...

492
00:50:29,076 --> 00:50:30,876
...I see you.

493
00:50:42,596 --> 00:50:44,006
This creature...

494
00:50:44,306 --> 00:50:47,386
...why do you bring him here?

495
00:50:48,846 --> 00:50:50,226
I was going to kill him...

496
00:50:50,516 --> 00:50:52,346
...but there was a sign from Eywa.

497
00:50:52,516 --> 00:50:54,606
I have said...

498
00:50:54,606 --> 00:50:57,276
...no dreamwalker will come here.

499
00:50:57,356 --> 00:50:58,686
What's he saying?

500
00:50:58,696 --> 00:51:01,526
His alien smell fills my nose.

501
00:51:01,616 --> 00:51:02,696
Hey, what's he saying?

502
00:51:02,696 --> 00:51:04,946
My father is deciding whether to kill you.

503
00:51:06,576 --> 00:51:09,536
Your father. It's nice to meet you, sir.

504
00:51:13,206 --> 00:51:14,706
Step back!

505
00:51:16,836 --> 00:51:20,256
I will look at this alien.

506
00:51:20,376 --> 00:51:21,676
That is Mother.

507
00:51:21,676 --> 00:51:25,676
She is Tsahik. The one who interprets the will of Eywa.

508
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:27,886
Who's Eywa?

509
00:51:34,726 --> 00:51:36,476
What are you called?

510
00:51:37,396 --> 00:51:38,776
Jake Sully.

511
00:51:48,696 --> 00:51:51,496
- Why did you come to us? - I came to learn.

512
00:51:52,866 --> 00:51:55,826
We have tried to teach other Sky People.

513
00:51:55,916 --> 00:51:59,256
It is hard to fill a cup which is already full.

514
00:52:00,756 --> 00:52:03,086
Well, my cup is empty, trust me.

515
00:52:04,296 --> 00:52:06,966
Just ask Dr. Augustine. I'm no scientist.

516
00:52:07,056 --> 00:52:08,506
What are you?

517
00:52:10,766 --> 00:52:13,976
I was a Marine. A...

518
00:52:14,846 --> 00:52:17,476
A warrior of the Jarhead clan.

519
00:52:17,936 --> 00:52:20,636
A warrior! I could kill him easily!

520
00:52:20,856 --> 00:52:22,146
No!

521
00:52:22,566 --> 00:52:26,776
This is the first warrior dreamwalker...

522
00:52:26,776 --> 00:52:28,736
...we have seen.

523
00:52:28,736 --> 00:52:31,616
We need to learn more about him.

524
00:52:34,036 --> 00:52:35,996
My Daughter...

525
00:52:35,996 --> 00:52:40,376
...you will teach him our way...

526
00:52:40,376 --> 00:52:43,836
...to speak and walk as we do.

527
00:52:43,836 --> 00:52:47,466
Why me? That's not fair...

528
00:52:48,256 --> 00:52:52,386
It is decided. My daughter will teach you our ways.

529
00:52:52,476 --> 00:52:56,056
Learn well, Jakesully.

530
00:52:56,856 --> 00:53:00,646
Then we will see if your insanity can be cured.

531
00:53:19,376 --> 00:53:20,836
Good evening.

532
00:53:23,876 --> 00:53:25,666
Please don't get up.

533
00:53:27,506 --> 00:53:28,836
Excuse me.

534
00:53:31,176 --> 00:53:32,346
Sorry.

535
00:53:35,436 --> 00:53:37,136
Hey, how you doing?

536
00:53:45,736 --> 00:53:46,736
Thank you.

537
00:53:49,276 --> 00:53:51,616
You know, I don't even know your name.

538
00:53:52,326 --> 00:53:54,746
Neytiri te Ckaha Mo'at'ite.

539
00:53:52,326 --> 00:53:54,746
Neytiri te Ckaha Mo'at'ite.

540
00:53:57,036 --> 00:53:58,956
Again, a whole lot slower?

541
00:53:58,996 --> 00:54:00,286
Neytiri.

542
00:54:00,376 --> 00:54:01,996
Neytili.

543
00:54:02,496 --> 00:54:04,296
Neytiri.

544
00:54:04,756 --> 00:54:06,666
Neytiri.

545
00:54:07,676 --> 00:54:09,676
It's nice to meet you, Neytiri.

546
00:54:10,296 --> 00:54:11,546
It's nice.

547
00:54:54,386 --> 00:54:56,676
- Jake. Jake! - He's in alpha.

548
00:54:56,766 --> 00:54:59,806
- He's coming out right now. - Jake. Jake!

549
00:55:01,596 --> 00:55:04,686
Come on back, kid. Come on. That's it.

550
00:55:06,356 --> 00:55:09,026
There you go. There you go, there you go.

551
00:55:09,106 --> 00:55:11,486
You're okay. You're okay.

552
00:55:11,566 --> 00:55:14,486
Damn! You were dug in like a tick.

553
00:55:17,576 --> 00:55:20,116
- Is the avatar safe? - Yeah, Doc.

554
00:55:21,246 --> 00:55:23,956
And you are not gonna believe where I am.

555
00:55:24,956 --> 00:55:27,956
The last thing we see is this Marine's ass

556
00:55:28,046 --> 00:55:32,176
disappearing into the brush with this angry thanator coming after him.

557
00:55:32,176 --> 00:55:35,176
- Hey, it's not something you can teach. - That is awesome.

558
00:55:35,256 --> 00:55:37,636
You know, for reasons I cannot fathom,

559
00:55:37,636 --> 00:55:40,976
the Omaticaya have chosen you. God help us all.

560
00:55:42,306 --> 00:55:43,806
"Jarhead clan"?

561
00:55:45,396 --> 00:55:48,436
- And it worked? - Hey, I'm practically family.

562
00:55:49,526 --> 00:55:53,026
They're gonna study me. I have to learn to be one of them.

563
00:55:53,026 --> 00:55:54,696
That's called taking the initiative, son.

564
00:55:54,696 --> 00:55:57,236
- I wish I had 10 more like you. - Look, Sully. Sully.

565
00:55:57,326 --> 00:56:00,746
Just find out what the blue monkeys want.

566
00:56:01,496 --> 00:56:07,336
You know, I mean, we try to give them medicine, education, roads.

567
00:56:07,336 --> 00:56:09,166
But no, no, no, they like mud.

568
00:56:09,256 --> 00:56:13,216
And that wouldn't bother me, it's just that they're...

569
00:56:13,796 --> 00:56:16,846
Hey, can you... Can somebody just... Sector 12.

570
00:56:18,636 --> 00:56:21,846
Okay, go, go, go, stop. Stop...

571
00:56:21,846 --> 00:56:24,056
Rich, stop! That's... Jesus!

572
00:56:24,056 --> 00:56:30,226
Their damn village happens to be resting on the richest unobtanium deposit

573
00:56:30,236 --> 00:56:35,606
within 200 klicks in any direction. I mean, look at all that cheddar!

574
00:56:39,366 --> 00:56:41,866
- Well, who gets them to move? - Guess.

575
00:56:43,786 --> 00:56:47,326
- What if they won't go? - I'm betting that they will.

576
00:56:47,836 --> 00:56:50,546
Okay, okay, okay, okay, hey. Look. Look.

577
00:56:51,376 --> 00:56:54,216
Killing the indigenous looks bad,

578
00:56:54,296 --> 00:56:58,046
but there's one thing that shareholders hate more than bad press,

579
00:56:58,136 --> 00:57:01,386
and that's a bad quarterly statement. I didn't make up the rules.

580
00:57:01,386 --> 00:57:04,596
So just find me a carrot that'll get them to move,

581
00:57:05,346 --> 00:57:08,436
otherwise it's gonna have to be all stick. Okay?

582
00:57:09,016 --> 00:57:12,726
You got three months. That's when the 'dozers get there.

583
00:57:12,816 --> 00:57:14,816
Well, we're wasting time.

584
00:57:15,776 --> 00:57:16,906
I like this guy.

585
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:20,576
- Guys, right now... - Okay, let's run through them again.

586
00:57:20,576 --> 00:57:22,906
Mo'at. Dragon lady.

587
00:57:24,956 --> 00:57:27,916
- Eytucan. - Eytukan. He's the clan leader.

588
00:57:27,996 --> 00:57:31,166
But she's the spiritual leader. Like a shaman.

589
00:57:31,246 --> 00:57:32,836
Got it.

590
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:35,126
- T'su'tey. - Tsu'tey.

591
00:57:35,216 --> 00:57:37,926
- Tsu'tey. - He'll be the next clan leader.

592
00:57:39,966 --> 00:57:42,426
- Neytiri. - She'll be the next Tsahik.

593
00:57:42,516 --> 00:57:44,516
They become a mated pair.

594
00:57:45,516 --> 00:57:47,766
- So who's this Eywa? - Who's Eywa?

595
00:57:48,686 --> 00:57:52,266
Only their deity. Their goddess, made up of all living things.

596
00:57:52,356 --> 00:57:53,726
Everything they know!

597
00:57:53,776 --> 00:57:55,896
You'd know this if you had any training whatsoever.

598
00:57:55,986 --> 00:57:57,356
Who's got a date with the chief's daughter?

599
00:57:57,406 --> 00:57:59,106
Come on. That's...

600
00:57:59,656 --> 00:58:01,776
Knock it off. It's like kindergarten around here.

601
00:58:03,866 --> 00:58:06,826
Neytiri was my best student.

602
00:58:06,906 --> 00:58:09,916
She and her sister, Sylwanin.

603
00:58:09,996 --> 00:58:12,416
Just amazing girls.

604
00:58:12,496 --> 00:58:14,086
I got a date with Sylwanin too.

605
00:58:15,006 --> 00:58:16,046
She's dead.

606
00:58:19,926 --> 00:58:22,466
Let's go. Village life starts early.

607
00:58:24,676 --> 00:58:27,176
Don't do anything unusually stupid.

608
00:58:46,366 --> 00:58:47,696
Easy, boy.

609
00:58:48,326 --> 00:58:50,416
Pale is female.

610
00:58:53,376 --> 00:58:55,796
Okay. Easy, girl.

611
00:59:24,576 --> 00:59:28,326
That is shahaylu. The bond.

612
00:59:30,496 --> 00:59:31,746
Feel her.

613
00:59:34,876 --> 00:59:39,006
Feel her heartbeat. Her breath.

614
00:59:42,006 --> 00:59:43,796
Feel her strong legs.

615
00:59:46,256 --> 00:59:48,596
You may tell her what to do.

616
00:59:48,676 --> 00:59:49,886
Inside.

617
00:59:50,846 --> 00:59:53,766
For now, say where to go.

618
00:59:56,766 --> 00:59:58,016
Forward!

619
01:00:15,626 --> 01:00:18,746
- You should go away. - No, you'd miss me.

620
01:00:20,166 --> 01:00:22,466
I knew you could speak English.

621
01:00:25,046 --> 01:00:27,216
This alien will learn nothing...

622
01:00:27,636 --> 01:00:29,256
...a rock sees more...

623
01:00:29,636 --> 01:00:31,516
...look at him.

624
01:00:40,776 --> 01:00:41,856
Again.

625
01:00:41,936 --> 01:00:45,446
If you want to hit this thing, it's gonna be complicated.

626
01:00:45,446 --> 01:00:47,946
Your scan doesn't show the internal structure.

627
01:00:48,026 --> 01:00:50,156
There's an outer row of columns.

628
01:00:50,156 --> 01:00:52,996
Real heavy duty. There's a secondary ring here,

629
01:00:52,996 --> 01:00:56,626
and an inner ring. There's a core structure like a spiral.

630
01:00:57,496 --> 01:00:59,126
That's how they move up and down.

631
01:00:59,206 --> 01:01:02,126
We're gonna need accurate scans on every column.

632
01:01:02,126 --> 01:01:03,506
Roger that.

633
01:01:03,586 --> 01:01:06,296
What else can you tell us about the structure?

634
01:01:06,296 --> 01:01:09,136
I'm guessing this secondary ring, that's also load-bearing.

635
01:01:13,676 --> 01:01:17,146
- So where are we going? - Getting out of Dodge.

636
01:01:18,516 --> 01:01:22,686
I'm not about to let Selfridge and Quaritch micro-manage this thing.

637
01:01:22,776 --> 01:01:26,026
There's a mobile link up at Site 26 we can work out of,

638
01:01:26,106 --> 01:01:28,066
way up in the mountains.

639
01:01:28,816 --> 01:01:31,196
The Hallelujah Mountains?

640
01:01:31,196 --> 01:01:33,496
- That's right. - Are you serious?

641
01:01:33,576 --> 01:01:35,536
- Yeah. - Yes!

642
01:01:38,996 --> 01:01:42,666
The legendary floating mountains of Pandora. Heard of them?

643
01:01:56,186 --> 01:01:58,056
We're getting close.

644
01:01:58,146 --> 01:02:00,856
Yeah, look at my instruments.

645
01:02:00,856 --> 01:02:03,896
Yep. We're in the Flux Vortex.

646
01:02:03,896 --> 01:02:06,236
We're VFR from here on.

647
01:02:06,236 --> 01:02:08,196
What's VFR?

648
01:02:08,196 --> 01:02:10,566
Means you gotta see where you're going.

649
01:02:10,656 --> 01:02:14,576
- You can't see anything. - Exactly. Ain't that a bitch?

650
01:02:33,056 --> 01:02:35,716
Oh, my God.

651
01:02:46,736 --> 01:02:48,106
You should see your faces.

652
01:03:15,136 --> 01:03:17,556
Thank you for flying Air Pandora.

653
01:03:30,566 --> 01:03:33,276
So what does hold them up?

654
01:03:33,366 --> 01:03:34,816
Grace explained it to me.

655
01:03:35,576 --> 01:03:37,486
Some kind of maglev effect.

656
01:03:37,576 --> 01:03:41,406
Because unobtanium is a superconductor... or something.

657
01:04:03,976 --> 01:04:05,556
Welcome to camp.

658
01:04:09,396 --> 01:04:14,066
- So, this is my bunk. - This stuff is nasty.

659
01:04:15,366 --> 01:04:17,406
- Norm, go under. - All right.

660
01:04:17,486 --> 01:04:21,036
- Grace didn't miss a thing. - Trudy, you'll take the top one.

661
01:04:21,036 --> 01:04:23,536
She knew I was talking to the Colonel.

662
01:04:23,536 --> 01:04:27,246
But I had what she needed, a way back in with the clan,

663
01:04:27,246 --> 01:04:28,876
so she's playing nice.

664
01:04:28,956 --> 01:04:34,046
All right. Jake, hang a left. You'll be in the link at the end.

665
01:04:36,926 --> 01:04:41,016
Unit one. Beulah. She's the least glitchy.

666
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:31,566
Holy shit!

667
01:05:32,436 --> 01:05:34,356
Do not look in her eye.

668
01:05:42,906 --> 01:05:44,616
Ikran is not horse.

669
01:05:45,786 --> 01:05:47,616
Once shahaylu is made,

670
01:05:51,496 --> 01:05:55,836
ikran will fly with only one hunter in the whole life.

671
01:06:05,766 --> 01:06:08,516
To become taronyu, hunter,

672
01:06:08,596 --> 01:06:12,186
you must choose your own ikran and he must choose you.

673
01:06:14,736 --> 01:06:16,776
- When? - When you are ready.

674
01:07:07,156 --> 01:07:10,326
Okay. This is video log 12.

675
01:07:11,496 --> 01:07:13,206
Time's 2132.

676
01:07:14,626 --> 01:07:18,046
Do I have to do this now? I really need to get some rack.

677
01:07:18,046 --> 01:07:20,926
No, now. When it's fresh.

678
01:07:23,546 --> 01:07:25,426
Okay, location, shack,

679
01:07:26,386 --> 01:07:28,726
and the days are starting to blur together.

680
01:07:30,846 --> 01:07:34,106
The language is a pain, but, you know,

681
01:07:34,106 --> 01:07:37,316
I figure it's like field-stripping a weapon. Just repetition, repetition.

682
01:07:37,396 --> 01:07:39,066
- Navi. - "Nari."

683
01:07:39,066 --> 01:07:41,396
- Nari. - "Narrri"!

684
01:07:41,406 --> 01:07:42,696
Narrri!

685
01:07:43,616 --> 01:07:45,656
Txurni'ul. Stronger.

686
01:07:50,246 --> 01:07:53,916
Neytiri calls me skxawng. It means moron.

687
01:07:56,246 --> 01:07:57,746
This is a very important part of it.

688
01:07:57,756 --> 01:07:59,956
- Norm's attitude has improved lately. - I see you. I see you.

689
01:07:59,966 --> 01:08:02,426
But it's not just, "I'm seeing you in front of me,"

690
01:08:02,426 --> 01:08:04,086
it's "I see into you. I See you."

691
01:08:04,176 --> 01:08:06,846
It's good he's back on board, but he thinks I'm a skxawng, too.

692
01:08:06,926 --> 01:08:09,176
"I'm accepting you. I understand you." So you gotta get this, okay?

693
01:08:09,516 --> 01:08:12,476
I gotta run! Okay? Let's go.

694
01:08:13,266 --> 01:08:16,856
My feet are getting tougher. I can run farther every day.

695
01:08:18,726 --> 01:08:21,856
I have to trust my body to know what to do.

696
01:08:26,946 --> 01:08:28,696
Yeah! Check it out!

697
01:08:29,496 --> 01:08:30,786
Oh, crap!

698
01:08:35,036 --> 01:08:39,956
Every day it's reading the trails, the tracks at the waterhole,

699
01:08:39,956 --> 01:08:42,216
the tiniest scents and sounds.

700
01:08:47,756 --> 01:08:52,556
She's always going on about the flow of energy, the spirits of animals.

701
01:08:53,306 --> 01:08:56,016
I really hope this tree-hugger crap isn't on the final.

702
01:08:56,106 --> 01:08:59,816
This isn't just about eye-hand coordination out there, you know.

703
01:08:59,816 --> 01:09:02,526
You need to listen to what she says.

704
01:09:02,606 --> 01:09:05,816
Try to see the forest through her eyes.

705
01:09:05,816 --> 01:09:08,446
Excuse me. This is my video log here.

706
01:09:23,836 --> 01:09:26,426
With Neytiri, it's learn fast or die.

707
01:09:27,676 --> 01:09:29,846
You gotta be kidding me.

708
01:09:58,876 --> 01:10:00,916
I talked Mo'at into letting Grace into the village.

709
01:10:01,046 --> 01:10:03,266
Look how big you are.

710
01:10:03,356 --> 01:10:04,666
It's the first time since her school was closed down.

711
01:10:04,756 --> 01:10:06,506
You are so pretty.

712
01:10:35,746 --> 01:10:37,326
Come on, Marine.

713
01:11:02,556 --> 01:11:05,266
I'm trying to understand this deep connection

714
01:11:05,356 --> 01:11:07,566
the people have to the forest.

715
01:11:08,026 --> 01:11:10,856
She talks about a network of energy

716
01:11:11,696 --> 01:11:14,276
that flows through all living things.

717
01:11:15,156 --> 01:11:18,496
She says all energy is only borrowed,

718
01:11:19,366 --> 01:11:21,996
and one day you have to give it back.

719
01:12:03,076 --> 01:12:05,536
You were in 16 hours today.

720
01:12:08,416 --> 01:12:10,416
You're still losing weight.

721
01:12:14,926 --> 01:12:16,596
No, you don't.

722
01:12:16,636 --> 01:12:19,386
- I gotta get some sleep. - Come back here.

723
01:12:21,596 --> 01:12:23,056
Bon appetit.

724
01:12:25,436 --> 01:12:26,976
Today I made a kill.

725
01:12:27,896 --> 01:12:30,776
And we ate it. At least, I know where that meal came from.

726
01:12:31,106 --> 01:12:35,276
Other body. You need to take care of this body. Okay?

727
01:12:35,366 --> 01:12:37,066
- Get it? Let's eat it. - Yeah, yeah.

728
01:12:37,656 --> 01:12:40,076
Here. I'll make it easy for you.

729
01:12:40,116 --> 01:12:42,366
Give it to me.

730
01:12:42,456 --> 01:12:43,956
- You look like crap. - Thank you.

731
01:12:44,036 --> 01:12:45,786
You're burning way too hard.

732
01:12:46,876 --> 01:12:48,706
Get rid of this shit.

733
01:12:48,796 --> 01:12:50,706
And then you can lecture me.

734
01:12:51,796 --> 01:12:54,506
Now, I'm telling you, as your boss,

735
01:12:55,966 --> 01:12:59,306
and as someone who might even consider being a friend someday

736
01:12:59,386 --> 01:13:01,806
to take some down time.

737
01:13:01,886 --> 01:13:03,636
Eat this, please.

738
01:13:05,146 --> 01:13:08,396
Trust me, I... learned the hard way.

739
01:13:22,996 --> 01:13:25,576
What did happen at the school, Grace?

740
01:13:33,756 --> 01:13:39,386
Neytiri's sister, Sylwanin, stopped coming to school.

741
01:13:39,466 --> 01:13:41,506
She was angry about the clear-cutting.

742
01:13:43,516 --> 01:13:46,886
And one day, she and a couple of other young hunters came running in

743
01:13:46,976 --> 01:13:50,106
all painted up.

744
01:13:50,186 --> 01:13:52,816
They had set a bulldozer on fire.

745
01:13:56,146 --> 01:13:59,026
I guess they thought I could protect them.

746
01:14:01,826 --> 01:14:04,656
The troopers pursued them to the school.

747
01:14:05,826 --> 01:14:08,036
They killed Sylwanin in the doorway.

748
01:14:08,076 --> 01:14:10,416
Right in front of Neytiri.

749
01:14:10,496 --> 01:14:11,666
And then shot the others.

750
01:14:14,456 --> 01:14:15,966
I got most of the kids out.

751
01:14:20,006 --> 01:14:21,636
But they never came back.

752
01:14:25,476 --> 01:14:26,476
I'm sorry.

753
01:14:35,066 --> 01:14:38,856
A scientist stays objective.

754
01:14:39,696 --> 01:14:43,576
We can't be ruled by emotion.

755
01:14:43,616 --> 01:14:46,826
But I put 10 years of my life into that school.

756
01:14:47,826 --> 01:14:50,576
They called me sa'nok.

757
01:14:52,666 --> 01:14:53,666
Mother.

758
01:14:53,746 --> 01:14:54,746
Mother.

759
01:14:57,166 --> 01:15:01,586
That kind of pain reaches back through the link.

760
01:15:27,036 --> 01:15:28,156
I see you...

761
01:15:28,246 --> 01:15:29,456
...Brother

762
01:15:29,916 --> 01:15:32,116
...and thank you.

763
01:15:36,246 --> 01:15:38,126
Your spirit goes with Eywa.

764
01:15:38,666 --> 01:15:40,506
Your body stays behind...

765
01:15:40,796 --> 01:15:43,466
...to become part of The People.

766
01:15:47,136 --> 01:15:48,636
A clean kill.

767
01:15:51,976 --> 01:15:53,476
You are ready.

768
01:16:19,126 --> 01:16:22,506
Learning to ride an ikran, we call them banshees,

769
01:16:22,586 --> 01:16:25,176
is the test every young hunter has to pass.

770
01:16:27,386 --> 01:16:30,716
But to do that, you gotta go where the banshees are.

771
01:16:31,556 --> 01:16:32,766
Oo-rah.

772
01:17:04,256 --> 01:17:05,506
Now what?

773
01:18:53,616 --> 01:18:55,576
Jakesully will go first.

774
01:19:28,446 --> 01:19:32,446
Now you choose your ikran. This you must feel inside.

775
01:19:33,366 --> 01:19:36,326
If he also chooses you, move quick like I showed.

776
01:19:36,406 --> 01:19:39,286
You will have one chance, Jake.

777
01:19:39,286 --> 01:19:41,456
How will I know if he chooses me?

778
01:19:41,536 --> 01:19:43,496
He will try to kill you.

779
01:19:44,666 --> 01:19:46,086
Outstanding.

780
01:20:46,356 --> 01:20:47,766
Let's dance.

781
01:20:53,906 --> 01:20:55,776
That moron's going to die.

782
01:21:19,636 --> 01:21:21,596
Don't be afraid, warrior.

783
01:21:21,596 --> 01:21:23,096
Make the bond!

784
01:21:26,396 --> 01:21:27,436
No!

785
01:21:31,396 --> 01:21:32,526
Jake!

786
01:21:46,536 --> 01:21:48,166
Shahaylu, Jake.

787
01:21:50,546 --> 01:21:51,796
Shahaylu!

788
01:22:01,886 --> 01:22:03,016
Stop!

789
01:22:11,646 --> 01:22:16,736
Yeah, that's right. You're mine. Huh?

790
01:22:29,956 --> 01:22:32,916
First flight seals the bond. You cannot wait.

791
01:22:34,416 --> 01:22:36,586
- Think, "Fly!" - Fly?

792
01:22:45,226 --> 01:22:46,476
God damn!

793
01:22:50,896 --> 01:22:52,146
Oh, shit!

794
01:23:01,616 --> 01:23:03,776
Shut up and fly straight!

795
01:23:14,046 --> 01:23:16,376
That's it. Bank left!

796
01:23:25,676 --> 01:23:27,466
Level out! That's it.

797
01:23:32,976 --> 01:23:34,306
Jakesully!

798
01:23:59,086 --> 01:24:00,166
Hey!

799
01:24:06,176 --> 01:24:07,506
Let's go!

800
01:24:19,936 --> 01:24:21,856
Yeah, baby, I got this!

801
01:24:22,696 --> 01:24:23,946
Oh, shit!

802
01:24:29,246 --> 01:24:32,996
I may not be much of a horse guy, but I was born to do this.

803
01:24:33,826 --> 01:24:34,916
Yeah!

804
01:24:35,876 --> 01:24:39,046
- I came like this. This you. - Yeah, yeah.

805
01:24:39,046 --> 01:24:44,046
- I turn. I feel the wind. I turn very strong. - Look, yeah, see, I banked so hard...

806
01:25:46,106 --> 01:25:48,116
The Tree of Souls.

807
01:25:51,536 --> 01:25:53,746
It's their most sacred place.

808
01:25:54,496 --> 01:25:57,326
See the Flux Vortex in these false color images?

809
01:25:57,416 --> 01:25:59,496
Yeah, that's what messes up my instruments.

810
01:25:59,586 --> 01:26:04,126
There is something really interesting going on in there biologically.

811
01:26:05,506 --> 01:26:07,586
I would die to get samples.

812
01:26:08,176 --> 01:26:11,006
Outsiders are strictly forbidden.

813
01:26:11,096 --> 01:26:12,426
You lucky swine.

814
01:27:33,796 --> 01:27:34,886
Hell, yeah!

815
01:27:34,966 --> 01:27:36,516
Hell, yeah!

816
01:27:49,316 --> 01:27:53,026
I was a stone-cold aerial hunter. Death from above.

817
01:27:54,366 --> 01:27:57,366
Only problem is, you're not the only one.

818
01:28:01,326 --> 01:28:02,416
Dive!

819
01:28:25,186 --> 01:28:26,396
Go, go!

820
01:28:34,566 --> 01:28:35,906
Follow me!

821
01:29:22,326 --> 01:29:24,956
Our guys call it a Great Leonopteryx.

822
01:29:25,826 --> 01:29:28,876
It is Toruk. Last Shadow.

823
01:29:30,626 --> 01:29:33,756
Yeah, right. It's the last one you ever see.

824
01:29:38,346 --> 01:29:42,136
My grandfather's grandfather was Toruk Macto.

825
01:29:42,806 --> 01:29:44,596
Rider of Last Shadow.

826
01:29:45,976 --> 01:29:47,436
He rode this?

827
01:29:49,066 --> 01:29:50,686
Toruk chose him.

828
01:29:51,026 --> 01:29:54,896
It has only happened five times since the time of the First Songs.

829
01:29:54,986 --> 01:29:56,986
- That's a long time. - Yes.

830
01:29:57,696 --> 01:29:59,566
Toruk Macto was mighty.

831
01:30:01,406 --> 01:30:05,246
He brought the clans together in a time of great sorrow.

832
01:30:05,246 --> 01:30:07,576
All Na'vi people know the story.

833
01:30:14,296 --> 01:30:18,506
Everything is backwards now. Like out there is the true world

834
01:30:19,636 --> 01:30:21,636
and in here is the dream.

835
01:30:42,326 --> 01:30:45,036
It's hard to believe it's only been three months.

836
01:30:48,076 --> 01:30:50,536
I can barely remember my old life.

837
01:30:54,086 --> 01:30:55,916
I don't know who I am anymore.

838
01:31:14,686 --> 01:31:17,526
Haven't gotten lost in the woods, have you?

839
01:31:20,696 --> 01:31:23,616
Your last report was more than two weeks ago.

840
01:31:25,826 --> 01:31:28,326
I'm starting to doubt your resolve!

841
01:31:30,916 --> 01:31:33,496
The way I see it, it's time to terminate the mission.

842
01:31:33,496 --> 01:31:35,376
No, I can do this.

843
01:31:35,456 --> 01:31:37,086
You already have.

844
01:31:38,006 --> 01:31:40,296
You give me good, usable intel.

845
01:31:40,296 --> 01:31:42,506
This Tree of Souls place.

846
01:31:42,966 --> 01:31:46,346
Yeah, I got them by the balls with that when this turns into a shit fight

847
01:31:46,426 --> 01:31:48,176
which it will. Yeah.

848
01:31:49,136 --> 01:31:51,136
Now it's time to come in.

849
01:31:52,606 --> 01:31:54,476
By the way,

850
01:31:54,976 --> 01:31:56,976
you gonna get your legs back.

851
01:31:57,856 --> 01:32:01,526
Yeah. I got your corporate approval. It's a done deal.

852
01:32:01,526 --> 01:32:03,986
Gonna have you on a shuttle tonight.

853
01:32:04,066 --> 01:32:05,866
I'm a man of my word.

854
01:32:08,786 --> 01:32:10,536
I gotta finish this.

855
01:32:12,826 --> 01:32:14,376
There's one more thing.

856
01:32:15,086 --> 01:32:20,046
Ceremony. It's the final stage of becoming a man.

857
01:32:22,546 --> 01:32:24,676
If I do it, I'm one of them.

858
01:32:26,176 --> 01:32:27,966
And they'll trust me.

859
01:32:31,596 --> 01:32:34,806
And I can negotiate the terms of their relocation.

860
01:32:48,406 --> 01:32:50,906
Well, then, you'd better get it done, Corporal.

861
01:33:08,346 --> 01:33:12,346
The Na'vi say that every person is born twice.

862
01:33:14,346 --> 01:33:19,766
The second time is when you earn your place among The People forever.

863
01:33:25,276 --> 01:33:29,576
You are now a son of the Omaticaya.

864
01:33:30,786 --> 01:33:34,036
You are part of The People.

865
01:34:20,336 --> 01:34:22,336
Come. Come.

866
01:34:39,976 --> 01:34:42,686
This is a place for prayers to be heard.

867
01:34:44,316 --> 01:34:46,186
And sometimes answered.

868
01:34:54,036 --> 01:34:56,746
We call these trees Utraya Mokri.

869
01:34:57,746 --> 01:34:59,496
The Tree of Voices.

870
01:35:01,496 --> 01:35:03,666
The voices of our ancestors.

871
01:35:18,686 --> 01:35:20,266
I can hear them.

872
01:35:25,186 --> 01:35:26,816
They live, Jake,

873
01:35:28,856 --> 01:35:30,276
within Eywa.

874
01:35:34,446 --> 01:35:36,326
You are Omaticaya now.

875
01:35:37,036 --> 01:35:40,156
You may make your bow from the wood of Hometree.

876
01:35:45,666 --> 01:35:47,756
And you may choose a woman.

877
01:35:49,876 --> 01:35:51,836
We have many fine women.

878
01:35:53,046 --> 01:35:55,046
Ninat is the best singer.

879
01:35:57,926 --> 01:35:59,846
But I don't want Ninat.

880
01:36:04,146 --> 01:36:06,106
Beyral is a good hunter.

881
01:36:07,776 --> 01:36:09,856
Yeah, she is a good hunter.

882
01:36:11,946 --> 01:36:13,696
I've already chosen.

883
01:36:17,196 --> 01:36:19,696
But this woman must also choose me.

884
01:36:23,706 --> 01:36:25,326
She already has.

885
01:37:19,766 --> 01:37:21,716
I am with you now, Jake.

886
01:37:23,266 --> 01:37:25,136
We are mated for life.

887
01:37:31,436 --> 01:37:33,486
What the hell are you doing, Jake?

888
01:38:03,926 --> 01:38:05,056
Ma Jake!

889
01:38:05,136 --> 01:38:06,436
Don't forget your phase integration.

890
01:38:06,516 --> 01:38:07,846
- Jake! - No, no, the middle button.

891
01:38:07,936 --> 01:38:09,856
- You gotta eat something. - Yeah, there you go.

892
01:38:18,276 --> 01:38:23,236
Jake! Jake. Wake up! Jake, please!

893
01:38:23,866 --> 01:38:26,366
Don't make me force-feed a cripple.

894
01:38:27,536 --> 01:38:29,126
Grace, I don't want... Hey!

895
01:38:32,916 --> 01:38:34,046
Jake!

896
01:38:42,966 --> 01:38:44,056
Okay.

897
01:38:55,146 --> 01:38:57,236
Here. I'm done. Let's go.

898
01:38:57,236 --> 01:38:59,566
And when was the last time you took a shower?

899
01:38:59,566 --> 01:39:01,656
- I don't need a shower. - Jesus, Marine.

900
01:39:05,786 --> 01:39:07,076
Jake!

901
01:39:13,836 --> 01:39:18,756
Jake! Wake up! Jake! Wake up!

902
01:39:22,256 --> 01:39:23,596
Hey!

903
01:39:24,256 --> 01:39:26,766
Stop! Stop!

904
01:39:26,766 --> 01:39:29,596
- Jake! - Go back, stop!

905
01:39:33,766 --> 01:39:35,106
Hey, boss.

906
01:39:35,606 --> 01:39:36,776
Hey!

907
01:39:39,356 --> 01:39:40,446
- What? - I got a native

908
01:39:40,526 --> 01:39:43,486
doing the funky chicken here. He's blocking my blade.

909
01:39:43,576 --> 01:39:46,696
Well, keep going. He'll move.

910
01:39:46,786 --> 01:39:50,036
These people have to learn that we don't stop. Come on, go, go, go.

911
01:39:52,376 --> 01:39:54,586
Stop! Hey!

912
01:39:54,666 --> 01:39:56,956
Go! Go!

913
01:39:57,966 --> 01:39:59,416
There, see? He moved.

914
01:40:11,806 --> 01:40:14,686
Dude, dude. Whoa, dude! Dude, no!

915
01:40:14,686 --> 01:40:15,686
I'm blind.

916
01:40:27,616 --> 01:40:29,866
- Jake! - Neytiri!

917
01:40:31,456 --> 01:40:33,116
Here, come on!

918
01:40:58,026 --> 01:41:00,606
Freeze it right there.

919
01:41:02,196 --> 01:41:04,656
Scale up. Enhance.

920
01:41:06,276 --> 01:41:07,826
Son of a bitch.

921
01:41:09,326 --> 01:41:10,786
Unbelievable.

922
01:41:11,866 --> 01:41:13,996
- Get me a pilot. - Yes, sir.

923
01:41:20,796 --> 01:41:22,966
Tsu'tey will lead the war party.

924
01:41:29,556 --> 01:41:30,846
Stop please!

925
01:41:32,346 --> 01:41:34,476
This will only make it worse.

926
01:41:34,596 --> 01:41:36,266
You do not speak here!

927
01:41:37,436 --> 01:41:39,226
We will strike them in the heart.

928
01:41:47,026 --> 01:41:49,196
Tsu'tey! Don't do this.

929
01:41:52,326 --> 01:41:53,866
- You! - Listen. Brother...

930
01:41:59,336 --> 01:42:02,506
- You mated with this woman? - Oh, shit.

931
01:42:03,756 --> 01:42:05,756
Is this true?

932
01:42:07,256 --> 01:42:10,466
We are mated before Eywa. It is done.

933
01:42:11,846 --> 01:42:13,016
Brother, please.

934
01:42:13,096 --> 01:42:16,936
Do not attack the Sky People. Many Omaticaya will die if you do.

935
01:42:16,936 --> 01:42:19,266
You are not my brother!

936
01:42:22,436 --> 01:42:24,236
And I am not your enemy!

937
01:42:25,856 --> 01:42:28,736
The enemy is out there, and they are very powerful!

938
01:42:30,986 --> 01:42:32,786
Go! Go! Go!

939
01:42:35,996 --> 01:42:38,496
- I can talk to them. - No more talk.

940
01:42:38,496 --> 01:42:39,916
Tsu'tey!

941
01:42:46,126 --> 01:42:49,046
I am Omaticaya. I am one of you.

942
01:42:49,846 --> 01:42:52,096
And I have the right to speak.

943
01:42:56,726 --> 01:42:58,596
I have something to say...

944
01:43:00,936 --> 01:43:02,396
...to all of you.

945
01:43:06,436 --> 01:43:08,526
The words are like stones in my heart.

946
01:43:12,866 --> 01:43:14,866
Sir, I'm sorry. No, no, no! Hold on!

947
01:43:14,866 --> 01:43:17,156
You can't interrupt a link in progress!

948
01:43:18,326 --> 01:43:19,666
It's very dangerous!

949
01:43:22,286 --> 01:43:23,456
Grace!

950
01:43:24,666 --> 01:43:25,876
Oh, no.

951
01:43:26,086 --> 01:43:28,086
- Wait! - Stay down, sir.

952
01:43:29,586 --> 01:43:31,836
Okay. Look...

953
01:43:32,926 --> 01:43:34,256
I was sent here to...

954
01:43:37,886 --> 01:43:39,306
You see?

955
01:43:39,476 --> 01:43:41,936
It is a demon in a false body.

956
01:44:01,826 --> 01:44:05,206
- Are you out of your goddamn mind? - You crossed the line.

957
01:44:08,666 --> 01:44:10,836
Wheel this meat out of here.

958
01:44:12,546 --> 01:44:15,096
Jake! What the hell is going on here?

959
01:44:18,346 --> 01:44:20,136
You let me down, son.

960
01:44:22,096 --> 01:44:23,396
So, what,

961
01:44:24,896 --> 01:44:26,936
you find yourself some local tail

962
01:44:26,936 --> 01:44:30,146
and you just completely forget what team you're playing for?

963
01:44:30,236 --> 01:44:32,736
Parker, there is time to salvage the situation.

964
01:44:32,816 --> 01:44:35,406
- Parker... - Shut your pie hole!

965
01:44:35,406 --> 01:44:39,616
Or what, Ranger Rick? You gonna shoot me?

966
01:44:39,696 --> 01:44:42,456
- I could do that. - You need to muzzle your dog.

967
01:44:42,536 --> 01:44:45,286
Yeah, can we just take this down a couple of notches, please?

968
01:44:45,376 --> 01:44:47,916
You say you want to keep your people alive?

969
01:44:47,916 --> 01:44:49,956
You start by listening to her.

970
01:44:50,046 --> 01:44:52,336
Those trees were sacred to the Omaticaya

971
01:44:52,426 --> 01:44:54,256
- in a way you can't imagine. - You know what?

972
01:44:54,256 --> 01:44:56,636
You throw a stick in the air around here,

973
01:44:56,636 --> 01:44:59,636
it's gonna land on some sacred fern,

974
01:44:59,716 --> 01:45:01,136
- for Christ's sake! - I'm not talking

975
01:45:01,136 --> 01:45:05,646
about some kind of pagan voodoo here. I'm talking about something real,

976
01:45:05,646 --> 01:45:07,816
something measurable in the biology of the forest.

977
01:45:07,816 --> 01:45:08,316
Something measurable in the biology of the forest.

978
01:45:08,396 --> 01:45:09,896
Which is what, exactly?

979
01:45:10,936 --> 01:45:12,316
What we think we know

980
01:45:12,316 --> 01:45:15,776
is that there is some kind of electrochemical communication

981
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:20,196
between the roots of the trees, like the synapses between neurons.

982
01:45:20,286 --> 01:45:24,866
And each tree has ten-to-the-fourth connections to the trees around it.

983
01:45:24,956 --> 01:45:28,126
And there are ten-to-the-twelfth trees on Pandora.

984
01:45:28,996 --> 01:45:31,336
Which is a lot, I'm guessing.

985
01:45:31,336 --> 01:45:33,756
It's more connections than the human brain.

986
01:45:34,926 --> 01:45:37,506
Get it? It's a network.

987
01:45:37,506 --> 01:45:40,556
It's a global network, and the Na'vi can access it.

988
01:45:40,636 --> 01:45:44,176
They can upload and download data. Memories.

989
01:45:44,186 --> 01:45:46,936
At sites like the one you just destroyed.

990
01:45:47,516 --> 01:45:48,606
Yes!

991
01:45:49,816 --> 01:45:53,936
What the hell have you people been smoking out there?

992
01:45:54,566 --> 01:45:56,656
They're just goddamn trees!

993
01:45:58,406 --> 01:46:01,196
- You need to wake up, Parker. - No. You need to wake up.

994
01:46:01,196 --> 01:46:05,706
The wealth of this world isn't in the ground. It's all around us.

995
01:46:05,786 --> 01:46:09,496
The Na'vi know that, and they are fighting to defend it.

996
01:46:09,586 --> 01:46:13,876
If you want to share this world with them, you need to understand them.

997
01:46:13,966 --> 01:46:18,676
I'd say we understand them just fine, thanks to Jake here.

998
01:46:20,386 --> 01:46:22,846
Hey, Doc, come take a look.

999
01:46:22,926 --> 01:46:25,176
They're not gonna give up their home.

1000
01:46:26,976 --> 01:46:28,646
They're not gonna make a deal.

1001
01:46:29,686 --> 01:46:31,976
For what? Lite beer?

1002
01:46:32,566 --> 01:46:34,106
And blue jeans?

1003
01:46:37,356 --> 01:46:40,236
There's nothing that we have that they want.

1004
01:46:42,156 --> 01:46:45,196
Everything they sent me out here to do is a waste of time.

1005
01:46:50,126 --> 01:46:51,536
They're never gonna leave Hometree.

1006
01:46:54,416 --> 01:47:00,426
So, since a deal can't be made, I guess things get real simple.

1007
01:47:00,636 --> 01:47:05,136
Jake, thanks. I'm getting all emotional.

1008
01:47:05,176 --> 01:47:07,806
I might just give you a big wet kiss.

1009
01:47:33,496 --> 01:47:35,206
Talk to me, Lyle.

1010
01:47:35,546 --> 01:47:38,086
It looks like they hit it with banshees first.

1011
01:47:38,216 --> 01:47:39,876
See the angle's steep?

1012
01:47:44,136 --> 01:47:46,136
They set the ampsuit on fire.

1013
01:47:46,516 --> 01:47:47,716
Driver's toast.

1014
01:47:49,226 --> 01:47:50,976
The rest of the squad?

1015
01:47:52,146 --> 01:47:55,066
Six bodies. That's all of them.

1016
01:47:56,526 --> 01:47:57,726
The equipment's totaled.

1017
01:48:00,566 --> 01:48:03,026
Jesus Christ.

1018
01:48:06,196 --> 01:48:09,576
I'll do it with minimal casualties to the indigenous.

1019
01:48:10,456 --> 01:48:12,956
I'll drive them out with gas first.

1020
01:48:14,206 --> 01:48:15,786
It'll be humane.

1021
01:48:17,416 --> 01:48:18,876
More or less.

1022
01:48:20,586 --> 01:48:22,426
All right, let's pull the trigger.

1023
01:48:25,886 --> 01:48:28,266
Come on, people. Let's get it packed, let's go.

1024
01:48:28,596 --> 01:48:31,766
You know, they never even wanted us to succeed.

1025
01:48:32,596 --> 01:48:38,146
They bulldozed a sacred site on purpose to trigger a response.

1026
01:48:38,226 --> 01:48:40,936
Just fabricating this war to get what they want.

1027
01:48:41,526 --> 01:48:43,406
This is how it's done.

1028
01:48:46,196 --> 01:48:49,496
When people are sitting on shit that you want,

1029
01:48:49,576 --> 01:48:53,616
you make them your enemy. Then you're justified in taking it.

1030
01:48:53,706 --> 01:48:56,996
Quaritch is rolling the gunships. He's gonna hit Hometree.

1031
01:48:57,086 --> 01:48:58,086
My God.

1032
01:49:04,546 --> 01:49:08,806
- Dr. Augustine! You cannot be up here! - Back off!

1033
01:49:08,806 --> 01:49:12,596
Parker. Wait. Stop. These are people you're about to...

1034
01:49:12,596 --> 01:49:13,766
- No. No, no, no, no. - I said back off!

1035
01:49:13,766 --> 01:49:17,266
They're fly-bitten savages that live in a tree!

1036
01:49:17,266 --> 01:49:18,976
All right? Look around!

1037
01:49:19,066 --> 01:49:22,776
I don't know about you, but I see a lot of trees! They can move!

1038
01:49:22,856 --> 01:49:24,316
- Can you guys just please... - Yes, sir.

1039
01:49:24,406 --> 01:49:26,986
There are families in there. There are children. Babies.

1040
01:49:26,986 --> 01:49:28,276
Are you gonna kill children?

1041
01:49:28,366 --> 01:49:32,286
You don't want that kind of blood on your hands. Believe me.

1042
01:49:32,366 --> 01:49:34,786
Just let me try to talk them out.

1043
01:49:35,576 --> 01:49:37,076
They trust me.

1044
01:49:40,336 --> 01:49:42,836
Calibrate fast. We're going in, right now.

1045
01:49:42,836 --> 01:49:44,836
Calibrating three and four.

1046
01:49:44,836 --> 01:49:47,796
- Run sequence. - Initiating. Thirty seconds.

1047
01:49:52,176 --> 01:49:53,976
Listen to me. You've got one hour.

1048
01:49:53,976 --> 01:49:56,646
Unless you want your girlfriend in there when the ax comes down,

1049
01:49:56,646 --> 01:49:59,306
you get them to evacuate. One hour.

1050
01:50:05,356 --> 01:50:06,486
Father!

1051
01:50:06,656 --> 01:50:07,696
Mother!

1052
01:50:07,696 --> 01:50:10,946
Eytukan, I have something to say.

1053
01:50:11,036 --> 01:50:12,446
Listen!

1054
01:50:13,496 --> 01:50:14,956
Speak, Jakesully.

1055
01:50:16,326 --> 01:50:19,286
A great evil is upon us...

1056
01:50:19,626 --> 01:50:21,496
The Sky People are coming...

1057
01:50:21,746 --> 01:50:24,256
...to destroy Hometree.

1058
01:50:26,716 --> 01:50:28,176
Look, tell them they're gonna be here soon.

1059
01:50:30,716 --> 01:50:33,556
You have to leave, or you're gonna die.

1060
01:50:33,556 --> 01:50:35,516
Are you certain of this?

1061
01:50:39,306 --> 01:50:43,026
Look, they sent me here to learn your ways

1062
01:50:44,186 --> 01:50:47,486
so one day I could bring this message and that you would believe it.

1063
01:50:50,026 --> 01:50:53,656
What are you saying, Jake? You knew this would happen?

1064
01:50:56,866 --> 01:50:58,416
Yes.

1065
01:50:58,416 --> 01:51:00,876
Look, at first it was just orders,

1066
01:51:02,376 --> 01:51:04,756
and then everything changed.

1067
01:51:04,756 --> 01:51:06,546
Okay? I fell in love.

1068
01:51:07,216 --> 01:51:12,506
I fell in love with the forest and with the Omaticaya people.

1069
01:51:13,676 --> 01:51:15,136
And with you.

1070
01:51:16,096 --> 01:51:17,926
- I trusted you. - With you. With you.

1071
01:51:18,016 --> 01:51:20,896
- I trusted you! - Trust me now, please.

1072
01:51:28,236 --> 01:51:30,736
You will never be one of The People!

1073
01:51:30,736 --> 01:51:32,616
- I shouldn't have... - We tried to stop them!

1074
01:51:32,616 --> 01:51:34,656
Neytiri, please! Please.

1075
01:51:39,576 --> 01:51:40,746
Bind them.

1076
01:51:42,376 --> 01:51:43,496
Leave now!

1077
01:51:43,666 --> 01:51:47,006
You have to go. They're coming!

1078
01:52:00,846 --> 01:52:03,106
Time on target, one mike.

1079
01:52:03,106 --> 01:52:05,146
Copy. We have a visual.

1080
01:52:05,146 --> 01:52:08,186
Roger that. Stay on heading 030.

1081
01:52:08,276 --> 01:52:09,606
Roger, 030.

1082
01:52:23,416 --> 01:52:25,456
- Run to the forest! - They're coming!

1083
01:52:27,086 --> 01:52:30,916
- They will destroy this place. - Neytiri, you must go now!

1084
01:52:34,676 --> 01:52:36,966
Run to the forest! Run!

1085
01:52:39,346 --> 01:52:40,676
Run! Run!

1086
01:52:40,686 --> 01:52:44,346
Have no fear.

1087
01:53:01,206 --> 01:53:04,956
No! God damn it, run!

1088
01:53:05,166 --> 01:53:06,706
Take the ikran...

1089
01:53:06,706 --> 01:53:08,296
...attack from above.

1090
01:53:12,546 --> 01:53:14,756
That is one big damn tree.

1091
01:53:22,266 --> 01:53:26,476
Well, well, well. I'd say diplomacy has failed.

1092
01:53:28,436 --> 01:53:30,526
All right, people, let's get this done!

1093
01:53:30,606 --> 01:53:33,526
I want every gas round you got right in the front door.

1094
01:53:33,526 --> 01:53:35,566
Roger. CS.40's going hot.

1095
01:53:35,946 --> 01:53:37,156
- Fire. - Firing.

1096
01:53:48,586 --> 01:53:50,626
Bingo. Mighty good shooting, ace.

1097
01:53:58,546 --> 01:54:00,216
Sir, they've opened fire.

1098
01:54:02,096 --> 01:54:03,846
You've got to be kidding me!

1099
01:54:16,406 --> 01:54:18,906
These dumb bastards ain't getting the message.

1100
01:54:18,986 --> 01:54:20,736
All right, let's turn up the heat.

1101
01:54:20,736 --> 01:54:23,746
- Switch incendiaries! - Switching incendiaries.

1102
01:54:23,746 --> 01:54:24,866
Fire.

1103
01:54:28,166 --> 01:54:29,246
No!

1104
01:54:42,466 --> 01:54:44,216
Get everyone to the forest.

1105
01:54:47,596 --> 01:54:49,806
And that's how you scatter the roaches.

1106
01:54:53,566 --> 01:54:54,776
Neytiri!

1107
01:55:03,446 --> 01:55:06,496
We gotta move! He's gonna blow the columns!

1108
01:55:06,576 --> 01:55:07,866
My God!

1109
01:55:26,426 --> 01:55:29,806
- Mo'at! No! - Lf you are one of us,

1110
01:55:31,306 --> 01:55:32,646
help us.

1111
01:55:40,406 --> 01:55:42,406
All call signs, switch missiles.

1112
01:55:42,576 --> 01:55:44,986
Give me HE's at the base of the west columns.

1113
01:55:46,946 --> 01:55:48,196
This way!

1114
01:55:49,326 --> 01:55:51,206
Rider section, switch missiles.

1115
01:55:51,286 --> 01:55:53,246
- One's good. - Two's rocks up.

1116
01:55:53,336 --> 01:55:55,876
- Three's up. - Yeah, baby, get some!

1117
01:55:56,416 --> 01:55:58,666
Charlie Oscar, Gunrunner standing by.

1118
01:55:58,756 --> 01:56:00,176
- Bring it down. - Cleared hot.

1119
01:56:07,216 --> 01:56:08,806
Come on, Grace, move!

1120
01:56:11,436 --> 01:56:13,016
Down! Head down!

1121
01:56:15,606 --> 01:56:17,856
Come on, come on! Down!

1122
01:56:22,616 --> 01:56:24,616
- Solid hits. - Solid rocks on target.

1123
01:56:24,696 --> 01:56:25,866
Screw this.

1124
01:56:27,116 --> 01:56:29,116
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

1125
01:56:29,206 --> 01:56:30,996
I didn't sign up for this shit!

1126
01:56:40,676 --> 01:56:42,546
Repeat. Ripple fire.

1127
01:57:26,096 --> 01:57:27,636
Go! Go! Go!

1128
01:58:00,756 --> 01:58:03,206
No, no, get back! Back!

1129
01:58:22,226 --> 01:58:24,816
Come on! Come on, move! Move!

1130
01:59:09,816 --> 01:59:13,446
That's good work, people. First round's on me tonight.

1131
01:59:14,116 --> 01:59:15,366
Let's boogie.

1132
01:59:15,786 --> 01:59:18,206
Dragon coming left, heading home.

1133
01:59:18,666 --> 01:59:20,576
Gunrunner coming left.

1134
01:59:20,666 --> 01:59:23,206
- Thunder copies. - Rider section copies.

1135
01:59:30,796 --> 01:59:31,886
Father!

1136
01:59:47,736 --> 01:59:49,066
Daughter...

1137
01:59:50,236 --> 01:59:53,316
take... my... bow.

1138
01:59:57,446 --> 02:00:01,916
Protect The People.

1139
02:00:10,296 --> 02:00:11,546
Neytiri!

1140
02:00:21,596 --> 02:00:25,316
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Get away.

1141
02:00:25,976 --> 02:00:27,276
Get away!

1142
02:00:28,356 --> 02:00:30,106
Get away from here!

1143
02:00:31,566 --> 02:00:33,156
Never come back!

1144
02:00:50,836 --> 02:00:51,966
Pull the plug.

1145
02:00:52,966 --> 02:00:55,636
- No, you can't do that! - You can't do that!

1146
02:00:55,636 --> 02:00:57,636
- Calm down! Calm down! - No! Please!

1147
02:01:13,816 --> 02:01:16,366
I was a warrior who dreamed he could bring peace.

1148
02:01:17,786 --> 02:01:21,656
Sooner or later, though, you always have to wake up.

1149
02:01:24,496 --> 02:01:25,956
Let's go!

1150
02:01:33,796 --> 02:01:35,386
Put him down!

1151
02:01:38,756 --> 02:01:41,516
You murderer!

1152
02:02:28,146 --> 02:02:30,226
What's going on, brother? Long time no see.

1153
02:02:30,316 --> 02:02:31,396
Hey.

1154
02:02:32,736 --> 02:02:35,446
Personally, I don't feel these tree-hugging traitors deserve steak.

1155
02:02:35,526 --> 02:02:38,906
They get steak? That's bullshit. Let me see that.

1156
02:02:39,906 --> 02:02:42,446
Yeah. You know what that is. Down.

1157
02:02:42,536 --> 02:02:45,076
- Trudy! - All the way down.

1158
02:02:48,456 --> 02:02:49,706
Max!

1159
02:02:59,756 --> 02:03:02,256
Trudy, fire up the ship! Go!

1160
02:03:02,846 --> 02:03:03,926
Here.

1161
02:03:16,026 --> 02:03:18,486
- Clear. Come on. - Here you go.

1162
02:03:34,046 --> 02:03:38,006
Max, stay here. I need someone on the inside I can trust.

1163
02:03:38,006 --> 02:03:39,296
Okay. Go.

1164
02:03:53,106 --> 02:03:54,266
Clear.

1165
02:03:56,236 --> 02:03:57,526
Come on, baby.

1166
02:03:57,526 --> 02:04:00,316
Colonel? Sir? I got a situation here.

1167
02:04:03,946 --> 02:04:06,986
It's Samson 1-6. Unauthorized engine start.

1168
02:04:10,036 --> 02:04:11,326
Three!

1169
02:04:14,166 --> 02:04:15,376
Come on!

1170
02:04:17,336 --> 02:04:18,666
Mask on!

1171
02:04:21,256 --> 02:04:23,086
Gas, gas, gas!

1172
02:04:24,716 --> 02:04:26,756
I'm taking fire! Let's go!

1173
02:04:29,226 --> 02:04:32,346
Grab my hand! Come on, we're in. Let's go!

1174
02:04:33,356 --> 02:04:35,186
Come on, let's go! Let's go, go!

1175
02:04:47,826 --> 02:04:49,156
Colonel!

1176
02:04:55,876 --> 02:04:59,416
- Yeah! Yeah! - All right! Yes!

1177
02:05:02,626 --> 02:05:05,296
- Crap. - Everybody all right back there?

1178
02:05:05,386 --> 02:05:06,926
Oh, yeah, baby!

1179
02:05:06,926 --> 02:05:08,846
- Norm, you good? - Yeah!

1180
02:05:09,726 --> 02:05:12,056
This is gonna ruin my whole day.

1181
02:05:12,306 --> 02:05:14,096
- Grace is hit! - What?

1182
02:05:15,226 --> 02:05:16,896
- Get the trauma kit. - Trauma kit!

1183
02:05:16,896 --> 02:05:20,396
- Keep the pressure on, Grace. - Trauma kit's forward, on the bulkhead.

1184
02:05:20,486 --> 02:05:24,986
- Hang on, Grace. - Doesn't matter. It's fine.

1185
02:05:28,326 --> 02:05:30,786
- You're good to go. - Take it up!

1186
02:05:31,956 --> 02:05:33,786
Hold on. I'm pulling pitch.

1187
02:05:38,206 --> 02:05:39,666
You're clear!

1188
02:05:47,596 --> 02:05:50,346
Just keep going north. Get us deep in the mountains.

1189
02:05:50,426 --> 02:05:51,846
Copy that.

1190
02:05:58,816 --> 02:06:02,106
- Norm, you all good up there? - Yep! Still here.

1191
02:06:03,986 --> 02:06:08,656
Well, at least they can't track us up here. Not this far into the Vortex.

1192
02:06:08,736 --> 02:06:10,786
It's strongest at the Tree of Souls, right?

1193
02:06:10,866 --> 02:06:12,366
Yeah.

1194
02:06:12,446 --> 02:06:14,406
Good. 'Cause that's where we're going.

1195
02:06:23,256 --> 02:06:24,416
Ouch.

1196
02:06:27,796 --> 02:06:29,256
You big baby.

1197
02:06:30,596 --> 02:06:32,056
We're moving.

1198
02:06:32,596 --> 02:06:34,636
I'm gonna get you some help, Grace.

1199
02:06:35,596 --> 02:06:37,766
I'm a scientist, remember?

1200
02:06:38,686 --> 02:06:41,146
I don't believe in fairy tales.

1201
02:06:41,976 --> 02:06:43,896
The People can help you.

1202
02:06:44,356 --> 02:06:45,646
I know it.

1203
02:06:47,656 --> 02:06:49,526
Why would they help us?

1204
02:07:05,546 --> 02:07:08,676
The People say Eywa will provide.

1205
02:07:10,596 --> 02:07:13,306
With no home, no hope,

1206
02:07:14,346 --> 02:07:16,516
there was only one place they could go.

1207
02:07:30,946 --> 02:07:32,156
Link's running.

1208
02:07:32,866 --> 02:07:35,866
- What's the plan here, Jake? - There's no plan.

1209
02:07:36,906 --> 02:07:41,576
Tsu'tey is Olo'eyktan now. He's not gonna let you near that place.

1210
02:07:42,536 --> 02:07:43,956
I gotta try.

1211
02:07:46,716 --> 02:07:48,046
Launching.

1212
02:08:09,526 --> 02:08:10,736
Outcast.

1213
02:08:11,526 --> 02:08:12,776
Betrayer.

1214
02:08:13,866 --> 02:08:15,026
Alien.

1215
02:08:16,576 --> 02:08:19,286
I was in the place the eye does not see.

1216
02:08:30,466 --> 02:08:34,346
I needed their help, and they needed mine.

1217
02:08:35,256 --> 02:08:37,306
But to ever face them again,

1218
02:08:37,306 --> 02:08:39,806
I was gonna have to take it to a whole new level.

1219
02:08:48,356 --> 02:08:51,696
Sometimes your whole life boils down to one insane move.

1220
02:08:54,446 --> 02:08:56,826
There's something we gotta do.

1221
02:08:56,906 --> 02:08:58,616
You're not gonna like it.

1222
02:09:08,626 --> 02:09:12,506
The way I had it figured, Toruk is the baddest cat in the sky.

1223
02:09:12,506 --> 02:09:14,176
Nothing attacks him.

1224
02:09:14,676 --> 02:09:16,006
Easy, boy.

1225
02:09:16,466 --> 02:09:18,306
So why would he ever look up?

1226
02:09:19,426 --> 02:09:21,056
But that was just a theory.

1227
02:10:31,756 --> 02:10:33,376
Toruk Macto?

1228
02:11:13,166 --> 02:11:14,666
I See you.

1229
02:11:17,756 --> 02:11:19,086
I See you.

1230
02:11:27,386 --> 02:11:29,096
I was afraid, Jake.

1231
02:11:30,516 --> 02:11:32,016
For my people.

1232
02:11:35,066 --> 02:11:36,686
I'm not anymore.

1233
02:11:46,116 --> 02:11:48,456
Tsu'tey, son of Ateyo...

1234
02:11:49,076 --> 02:11:51,126
...I stand before you...

1235
02:11:52,126 --> 02:11:55,296
...ready to serve the Omaticaya people.

1236
02:11:57,876 --> 02:12:02,136
You are Olo'eyktan, and you are a great warrior.

1237
02:12:03,306 --> 02:12:05,466
I can't do this without you.

1238
02:12:12,516 --> 02:12:13,936
Toruk Macto,

1239
02:12:21,776 --> 02:12:23,526
I will fly with you.

1240
02:12:26,826 --> 02:12:28,576
My friend is dying.

1241
02:12:30,956 --> 02:12:32,496
Grace is dying.

1242
02:12:34,496 --> 02:12:36,336
I beg the help of Eywa.

1243
02:12:48,266 --> 02:12:50,266
Look where we are, Grace.

1244
02:12:56,976 --> 02:12:59,356
I need to take some samples.

1245
02:13:22,796 --> 02:13:26,886
The Great Mother may choose to save all that she is

1246
02:13:28,096 --> 02:13:29,556
in this body.

1247
02:13:32,096 --> 02:13:33,766
Is that possible?

1248
02:13:33,846 --> 02:13:38,356
She must pass through the eye of Eywa and return.

1249
02:13:39,606 --> 02:13:41,146
But, Jakesully,

1250
02:13:42,146 --> 02:13:43,776
she is very weak.

1251
02:13:45,236 --> 02:13:48,076
Hang on, Grace. They're gonna fix you up.

1252
02:13:51,246 --> 02:13:53,866
Hear us please, All Mother.

1253
02:13:54,416 --> 02:13:56,746
Eywa, help her.

1254
02:13:57,416 --> 02:13:59,626
Take this spirit into you...

1255
02:14:03,166 --> 02:14:05,426
...and breathe her back to us.

1256
02:14:09,216 --> 02:14:10,886
Let her walk among us...

1257
02:14:13,386 --> 02:14:15,346
...as one of The People.

1258
02:14:44,296 --> 02:14:45,376
Jake.

1259
02:14:47,796 --> 02:14:48,966
Grace.

1260
02:14:51,096 --> 02:14:52,806
I'm with her, Jake.

1261
02:14:54,806 --> 02:14:56,186
She's real!

1262
02:14:59,226 --> 02:15:02,396
Grace? Grace, please. Grace!

1263
02:15:03,566 --> 02:15:05,186
What's happening?

1264
02:15:06,146 --> 02:15:07,816
What's happening?

1265
02:15:12,156 --> 02:15:13,326
Grace!

1266
02:15:14,036 --> 02:15:15,196
Grace!

1267
02:15:17,286 --> 02:15:18,916
What's happening?

1268
02:15:25,166 --> 02:15:26,586
Did it work?

1269
02:15:32,256 --> 02:15:36,346
Her wounds were too great. It was not enough time.

1270
02:15:38,016 --> 02:15:39,766
She is with Eywa now.

1271
02:16:13,556 --> 02:16:16,216
With your permission, I will speak now.

1272
02:16:18,596 --> 02:16:21,056
You would honor me by translating.

1273
02:16:28,146 --> 02:16:30,356
The Sky People have sent us a message

1274
02:16:33,736 --> 02:16:36,156
that they can take whatever they want

1275
02:16:37,946 --> 02:16:39,746
and no one can stop them.

1276
02:16:43,326 --> 02:16:45,126
Well, we will send them a message.

1277
02:16:47,756 --> 02:16:50,086
You ride out as fast as the wind can carry you.

1278
02:16:53,386 --> 02:16:55,756
You tell the other clans to come.

1279
02:16:58,886 --> 02:17:01,386
You tell them Toruk Macto calls to them.

1280
02:17:03,606 --> 02:17:06,396
And you fly now with me!

1281
02:17:07,436 --> 02:17:09,936
My brothers! Sisters!

1282
02:17:11,026 --> 02:17:13,106
And we will show the Sky People

1283
02:17:14,116 --> 02:17:15,986
that they cannot take whatever they want,

1284
02:17:17,486 --> 02:17:18,946
and that this,

1285
02:17:19,656 --> 02:17:20,696
this is our land!

1286
02:17:27,796 --> 02:17:29,246
Yah!

1287
02:17:44,346 --> 02:17:45,766
Yah!

1288
02:18:15,176 --> 02:18:16,546
Yah!

1289
02:18:34,066 --> 02:18:35,566
We rode out to the four winds.

1290
02:18:38,316 --> 02:18:40,736
To the horse clans of the plain.

1291
02:18:43,706 --> 02:18:44,746
Back to the stars!

1292
02:18:44,826 --> 02:18:47,076
To the ikran people ofthe Eastern Sea.

1293
02:18:47,076 --> 02:18:48,376
For our children's children!

1294
02:18:48,456 --> 02:18:51,036
When Toruk Macto called them, they came.

1295
02:18:54,876 --> 02:18:56,256
Yah!

1296
02:19:32,416 --> 02:19:34,916
Everyone on this base, every one of you,

1297
02:19:35,006 --> 02:19:36,836
is fighting for survival.

1298
02:19:36,916 --> 02:19:38,426
That's a fact!

1299
02:19:39,256 --> 02:19:43,006
There's an aboriginal horde out there massing for an attack.

1300
02:19:44,096 --> 02:19:47,976
Now, these orbital images tell me

1301
02:19:48,386 --> 02:19:51,646
that the hostiles' numbers have gone from a few hundred

1302
02:19:51,646 --> 02:19:54,226
to well over 2,000 in one day.

1303
02:19:54,776 --> 02:19:56,776
And more are pouring in.

1304
02:19:59,236 --> 02:20:02,656
In a week's time, there could be 20,000 of them.

1305
02:20:02,736 --> 02:20:05,116
At that point, they will overrun our perimeter.

1306
02:20:05,116 --> 02:20:07,366
Well, that's not gonna happen!

1307
02:20:08,956 --> 02:20:12,626
Our only security lies in pre-emptive attack.

1308
02:20:12,626 --> 02:20:15,046
We will fight terror with terror.

1309
02:20:19,336 --> 02:20:23,506
Now, the hostiles believe that this mountain stronghold of theirs

1310
02:20:23,596 --> 02:20:26,006
is protected by their...

1311
02:20:26,016 --> 02:20:27,426
Their deity.

1312
02:20:28,726 --> 02:20:30,846
And when we destroy it,

1313
02:20:30,846 --> 02:20:33,226
we will blast a crater in their racial memory so deep

1314
02:20:33,306 --> 02:20:36,816
that they won't come within 1,000 klicks of this place ever again.

1315
02:20:36,896 --> 02:20:39,606
And that, too, is a fact.

1316
02:20:40,316 --> 02:20:42,066
Yeah! Yeah.

1317
02:20:52,536 --> 02:20:56,496
Jake, it's crazy here. It's full mobilization. They're rigging the shuttle as a bomber.

1318
02:20:56,586 --> 02:20:58,836
They've got these huge pallets of mine explosives.

1319
02:20:58,916 --> 02:21:01,836
It's for some kind of shock-and-awe campaign.

1320
02:21:01,926 --> 02:21:03,836
Fricking daisy cutters!

1321
02:21:05,346 --> 02:21:08,176
Quaritch has taken over. He's rolling, and there's no stopping him.

1322
02:21:08,266 --> 02:21:10,346
- When? - 0600 tomorrow.

1323
02:21:10,436 --> 02:21:12,306
- Max! Max! - I gotta go.

1324
02:21:14,186 --> 02:21:15,686
We're screwed!

1325
02:21:17,146 --> 02:21:19,396
And I was hoping for some sort of tactical plan

1326
02:21:19,396 --> 02:21:21,646
that didn't involve martyrdom.

1327
02:21:23,106 --> 02:21:26,486
We're going up against gunships with bows and arrows.

1328
02:21:29,496 --> 02:21:31,536
I have 15 clans out there.

1329
02:21:32,206 --> 02:21:34,326
That's over 2,000 warriors.

1330
02:21:35,836 --> 02:21:40,296
Now, we know these mountains. We fly them. You fly them. They don't.

1331
02:21:41,336 --> 02:21:45,386
Their instruments won't work up here. Missile tracking won't work.

1332
02:21:45,886 --> 02:21:47,386
They'll have to fire a line of sight.

1333
02:21:47,466 --> 02:21:51,726
If they bring the fight to us, then we have the home-field advantage.

1334
02:21:53,596 --> 02:21:57,056
You know he's gonna commit that bomber straight to the Tree of Souls.

1335
02:21:57,146 --> 02:21:58,396
Yeah, I know.

1336
02:21:58,396 --> 02:22:00,936
If they get to the Tree of Souls, it's over.

1337
02:22:01,026 --> 02:22:04,236
That's their direct line to Eywa, their ancestors.

1338
02:22:05,026 --> 02:22:07,066
It'll destroy them.

1339
02:22:07,066 --> 02:22:09,526
Then I guess we'd better stop him.

1340
02:22:24,586 --> 02:22:27,586
I'm probably just talking to a tree right now.

1341
02:22:30,006 --> 02:22:34,766
But if you're there, I need to give you a heads-up.

1342
02:22:37,306 --> 02:22:41,726
If Grace is with you, look into her memories.

1343
02:22:42,986 --> 02:22:45,106
See the world we come from.

1344
02:22:46,196 --> 02:22:48,106
There's no green there.

1345
02:22:49,486 --> 02:22:51,486
They killed their Mother.

1346
02:22:52,286 --> 02:22:54,786
And they're gonna do the same here.

1347
02:22:56,416 --> 02:22:58,996
More Sky People are gonna come.

1348
02:22:59,086 --> 02:23:02,126
They're gonna come like a rain that never ends.

1349
02:23:03,416 --> 02:23:05,166
Unless we stop them.

1350
02:23:07,756 --> 02:23:10,846
Look, you chose me for something.

1351
02:23:12,306 --> 02:23:14,176
I will stand and fight.

1352
02:23:15,226 --> 02:23:16,806
You know I will.

1353
02:23:19,306 --> 02:23:21,566
But I need a little help here.

1354
02:23:27,696 --> 02:23:30,736
Our Great Mother does not take sides, Jake.

1355
02:23:32,536 --> 02:23:35,996
She protects only the balance of life.

1356
02:23:47,796 --> 02:23:49,506
It was worth a try.

1357
02:24:20,206 --> 02:24:22,246
Yeah! Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!

1358
02:24:22,246 --> 02:24:25,626
Yeah! Yeah! That's what I'm talking about, man!

1359
02:24:37,726 --> 02:24:41,096
This is Group Leader. We are entering the Flux Vortex.

1360
02:24:41,476 --> 02:24:45,066
- Switch to manual flight mode. - Copy. Manual flight mode.

1361
02:25:19,976 --> 02:25:21,846
This is Papa Dragon.

1362
02:25:21,936 --> 02:25:25,016
I want this mission high and tight. I want to be home for dinner.

1363
02:25:32,526 --> 02:25:36,276
- Suit Team, go. - All right, ladies, let's bring the pain!

1364
02:25:46,836 --> 02:25:48,456
Move, move, move!

1365
02:25:54,086 --> 02:25:55,886
Bravo 1-1, move left.

1366
02:25:56,426 --> 02:25:59,846
Bravo 1-1 moving left. Watch flank.

1367
02:26:02,176 --> 02:26:05,806
- Watch formation. Keep moving. - Roger that.

1368
02:26:05,806 --> 02:26:08,226
Charlie 2-1, watch your spacing.

1369
02:26:08,316 --> 02:26:09,686
Copy that. Over.

1370
02:26:09,686 --> 02:26:14,396
Eyes up. Check that overhead. And watch those thermal scans.

1371
02:26:14,986 --> 02:26:18,366
All call signs, Papa has lead, pushing to target.

1372
02:26:18,366 --> 02:26:20,826
Escorts, stay close on my shuttle.

1373
02:26:25,916 --> 02:26:28,456
We are gonna lose some paint in here.

1374
02:26:29,416 --> 02:26:32,046
Gun crews, keep your head on a swivel.

1375
02:26:32,166 --> 02:26:35,086
Make no mistake, people, they're out there.

1376
02:26:36,676 --> 02:26:39,926
All right, people, target in sight. Range, four klicks.

1377
02:26:40,006 --> 02:26:42,216
Valkyrie 1-6, get your payload ready.

1378
02:26:42,346 --> 02:26:44,846
- Copy. Prepare to offload. - Staff Sergeant, stage the weapon.

1379
02:26:45,636 --> 02:26:47,846
Roll it to the ramp! Let's go!

1380
02:26:50,106 --> 02:26:51,186
Hold!

1381
02:26:59,196 --> 02:27:01,236
Charlie 2-1, got big movement.

1382
02:27:01,326 --> 02:27:02,736
- Hold position. - Hold up, hold up.

1383
02:27:02,826 --> 02:27:06,996
- We got movement out there, 500 meters. - Charlie 2-1, hold position.

1384
02:27:13,086 --> 02:27:16,086
Sir, ground has movement! Fast approaching.

1385
02:27:16,086 --> 02:27:18,676
- Charlie Oscar, Rider section. - Firing line!

1386
02:27:19,046 --> 02:27:21,756
Targets closing. Range, 400 meters.

1387
02:27:22,466 --> 02:27:25,226
- Can't you clean it up? - No, sir. It's the Flux.

1388
02:27:53,496 --> 02:27:56,166
Brother, I'm gonna punch a hole. You follow me through.

1389
02:28:37,916 --> 02:28:40,676
All aircraft, weapons free! Weapons free!

1390
02:28:41,796 --> 02:28:43,006
Break right. Come around.

1391
02:28:46,556 --> 02:28:48,056
Light them up!

1392
02:28:55,686 --> 02:28:57,896
Break formation, engage all hostiles.

1393
02:29:05,156 --> 02:29:07,036
Yeah! Get some!

1394
02:29:46,026 --> 02:29:47,866
Scorpions, pursue and destroy.

1395
02:29:58,706 --> 02:30:00,506
Jake! Jake! You copy?

1396
02:30:01,166 --> 02:30:03,876
We're falling back! We're getting hammered!

1397
02:30:03,876 --> 02:30:04,876
Copy. Get out of there.

1398
02:30:10,056 --> 02:30:11,466
That's him. Get after him!

1399
02:30:28,406 --> 02:30:29,906
Take him out!

1400
02:30:38,206 --> 02:30:39,666
Light her up!

1401
02:30:48,676 --> 02:30:50,096
Right there!

1402
02:30:50,216 --> 02:30:52,466
You're not the only one with a gun, bitch.

1403
02:30:52,726 --> 02:30:54,426
- Keep her in your sights. - Purging. Feeding the leak.

1404
02:30:54,436 --> 02:30:55,516
Arming all pods.

1405
02:31:01,226 --> 02:31:02,316
That's it!

1406
02:31:32,966 --> 02:31:34,096
Seyzey!

1407
02:32:38,036 --> 02:32:40,206
Rogue One is hit. I'm going in.

1408
02:32:41,166 --> 02:32:42,576
Sorry, Jake.

1409
02:32:59,596 --> 02:33:00,686
Fire.

1410
02:33:18,786 --> 02:33:21,286
Tsu'tey! Brother, do you read?

1411
02:33:24,126 --> 02:33:25,786
Rogue One, you copy?

1412
02:33:27,796 --> 02:33:28,956
Trudy!

1413
02:33:39,846 --> 02:33:41,136
Time to target, two minutes.

1414
02:33:41,476 --> 02:33:43,896
Valkyrie 1-6, you are cleared and hot.

1415
02:33:43,976 --> 02:33:46,146
Copy, Dragon. We are starting our bomb run.

1416
02:33:51,986 --> 02:33:55,816
- Arm number one! - Number one armed!

1417
02:33:57,196 --> 02:33:58,446
Ma Jake!

1418
02:34:00,366 --> 02:34:01,536
I read you.

1419
02:34:10,666 --> 02:34:12,666
- Neytiri! - Seyzey's dead.

1420
02:34:13,256 --> 02:34:15,756
They are very close. They are many.

1421
02:34:17,176 --> 02:34:18,676
Do not attack.

1422
02:34:19,256 --> 02:34:21,216
Do you read me, Neytiri?

1423
02:34:23,806 --> 02:34:25,096
Do not attack!

1424
02:34:25,436 --> 02:34:28,606
Fall back now. Get out of there! That's an order!

1425
02:34:36,696 --> 02:34:37,906
Neytiri!

1426
02:34:39,986 --> 02:34:41,906
I got movement, I got movement.

1427
02:34:41,996 --> 02:34:44,246
Hold position. Something's coming.

1428
02:34:44,326 --> 02:34:46,116
Bravo 1-1, I got a big seating. Turn screens over.

1429
02:34:46,206 --> 02:34:48,416
- We got movement 200 meters. - Hold your formation.

1430
02:34:48,416 --> 02:34:50,166
- Be ready. - Watch your flanks.

1431
02:34:55,296 --> 02:34:56,796
Hundred meters and closing fast.

1432
02:35:13,356 --> 02:35:14,936
We gotta get out of here!

1433
02:35:22,736 --> 02:35:24,446
- Fall back! Fall back! - Move! Move! Move!

1434
02:35:24,536 --> 02:35:26,956
Fall back! On the run! On the run!

1435
02:35:34,086 --> 02:35:36,756
Jake, Eywa has heard you.

1436
02:35:43,676 --> 02:35:45,466
Eywa has heard you!

1437
02:35:56,026 --> 02:35:57,446
Come on!

1438
02:36:09,706 --> 02:36:11,576
Fall back! Move! Move!

1439
02:36:36,066 --> 02:36:38,776
Sir! All escorts are down or falling back.

1440
02:36:38,776 --> 02:36:42,906
Let's get this done. Valkyrie 1-6, this is Dragon.

1441
02:36:42,986 --> 02:36:45,906
- Press to target. - Copy. Pressing to target.

1442
02:36:45,906 --> 02:36:47,946
Stand by to drop, 30 seconds.

1443
02:37:07,766 --> 02:37:10,266
On my mark. Two, one, mark.

1444
02:37:10,266 --> 02:37:12,596
Drop! Drop! Drop! Go, go, go, go!

1445
02:37:12,596 --> 02:37:13,016
Drop! Drop! Drop! Go, go, go, go!

1446
02:37:46,756 --> 02:37:47,926
Brace!

1447
02:38:04,946 --> 02:38:06,316
It's Sully.

1448
02:38:20,006 --> 02:38:22,296
- Mask on! - Breach alarm!

1449
02:41:06,666 --> 02:41:08,546
Come on. Come to papa.

1450
02:41:35,986 --> 02:41:37,786
Give it up, Quaritch!

1451
02:41:40,826 --> 02:41:42,326
It's all over.

1452
02:41:43,576 --> 02:41:46,126
Nothing's over while I'm breathing.

1453
02:41:46,126 --> 02:41:48,416
I kind of hoped you'd say that.

1454
02:42:44,556 --> 02:42:45,806
Come on!

1455
02:43:01,656 --> 02:43:05,786
Hey, Sully, how's it feel to betray your own race?

1456
02:43:10,416 --> 02:43:12,626
You think you're one of them?

1457
02:43:13,836 --> 02:43:15,506
Time to wake up.

1458
02:44:59,696 --> 02:45:00,776
Jake?

1459
02:45:14,456 --> 02:45:15,586
Jake.

1460
02:45:33,556 --> 02:45:34,976
Jake.

1461
02:45:50,996 --> 02:45:52,996
Jake! Ma Jake!

1462
02:46:34,666 --> 02:46:35,996
I See you.

1463
02:46:41,586 --> 02:46:42,916
I See you.

1464
02:47:08,026 --> 02:47:09,236
I See you, Brother.

1465
02:47:10,446 --> 02:47:11,656
Are The People safe?

1466
02:47:14,496 --> 02:47:15,616
They're safe.

1467
02:47:22,126 --> 02:47:23,626
I can't...

1468
02:47:24,796 --> 02:47:27,046
I cannot lead The People.

1469
02:47:27,586 --> 02:47:29,926
You must lead them... Jakesully.

1470
02:47:31,306 --> 02:47:33,216
I'm not officer material.

1471
02:47:33,306 --> 02:47:35,056
It is decided.

1472
02:47:38,396 --> 02:47:39,596
Now...

1473
02:47:40,816 --> 02:47:43,226
...do the duty of Olo'eyktan.

1474
02:47:47,816 --> 02:47:49,486
I will not kill you.

1475
02:47:49,526 --> 02:47:51,156
It is the way!

1476
02:47:53,486 --> 02:47:55,076
And it is good.

1477
02:47:57,326 --> 02:47:59,166
I will be remembered.

1478
02:48:01,786 --> 02:48:05,836
I fought... with Toruk Macto!

1479
02:48:08,336 --> 02:48:10,216
And we were brothers.

1480
02:48:11,636 --> 02:48:15,716
And he... was my last shadow.

1481
02:49:02,146 --> 02:49:04,976
The aliens went back to their dying world.

1482
02:49:07,146 --> 02:49:10,066
Only a few were chosen to stay.

1483
02:49:22,286 --> 02:49:24,826
The time of great sorrow was ending.

1484
02:49:26,876 --> 02:49:29,296
Toruk Macto was no longerneeded.

1485
02:49:41,846 --> 02:49:45,726
Well, I guess this is my last video log.

1486
02:49:47,566 --> 02:49:51,396
'Cause whatever happens tonight, either way, I'm...

1487
02:49:52,406 --> 02:49:55,236
I'm not gonna be coming back to this place.

1488
02:49:58,866 --> 02:50:00,996
Well, I guess I'd better go.

1489
02:50:03,576 --> 02:50:06,626
Yeah, I don't want to be late for my own party.

1490
02:50:09,956 --> 02:50:12,416
Yeah, it's my birthday, after all.

1491
02:50:14,926 --> 02:50:17,256
This is Jake Sully signing off.

1492
02:51:49,216 --> 02:51:52,436
Walking through a dream

1493
02:51:52,436 --> 02:51:55,966
I see you

1494
02:51:55,966 --> 02:52:02,516
My light in darkness breathing hope of new life

1495
02:52:02,516 --> 02:52:06,856
Now I live through you and you through me

1496
02:52:06,856 --> 02:52:10,076
Enchanting

1497
02:52:10,076 --> 02:52:17,886
I pray in my heart that this dream never end

1498
02:52:18,146 --> 02:52:26,776
I see me through your eyes

1499
02:52:26,776 --> 02:52:35,066
Living through life flying high

1500
02:52:35,066 --> 02:52:41,936
Your life shines the way into paradise

1501
02:52:42,076 --> 02:52:45,776
So I offer my life

1502
02:52:45,776 --> 02:52:51,126
I offer my love, for you

1503
02:52:51,466 --> 02:52:54,616
When my heart was never open

1504
02:52:54,616 --> 02:52:57,756
And my spirit never free

1505
02:52:57,756 --> 02:53:04,936
To the world that you have shown me

1506
02:53:04,936 --> 02:53:09,976
But my eyes could not division

1507
02:53:09,976 --> 02:53:18,846
All the colours of love and of life ever more

1508
02:53:18,846 --> 02:53:26,686
Evermore(I see me through your eyes)

1509
02:53:26,686 --> 02:53:33,166
I see me through your eyes(Living through life flying high)

1510
02:53:33,166 --> 02:53:36,756
Flying high

1511
02:53:36,756 --> 02:53:43,596
Your love shines the way into paradise

1512
02:53:43,596 --> 02:53:50,676
So I offer my life as a sacrifice

1513
02:53:50,676 --> 02:53:57,896
And live through your love

1514
02:53:57,896 --> 02:54:08,096
And live through your life

1515
02:54:12,096 --> 02:54:17,446
I see you

1516
02:54:18,846 --> 02:54:33,146
I see you
