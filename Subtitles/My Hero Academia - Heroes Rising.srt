1
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,370
That's Shuici Iguchi!

2
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,910
As I thought, the League of Villains!

3
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,010
Shit!

4
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:03,830
It's sturdy!

5
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,060
I'll go closer!

6
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,110
Deadbolt!

7
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:24,010
Sorry!

8
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:28,090
Dabi!

9
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,890
You're too persistent!

10
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,530
Bastards...
What are you up to-

11
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,430
Don't ask pointless questions.

12
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,250
Why are the heroes...

13
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,280
The information was leaked...

14
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,780
Leaked? From where...?

15
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,380
Who knows...

16
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,140
The pursuit team was overtaken.
Now...

17
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,700
You don't have to say it.

18
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,190
Leave it to me.

19
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,060
Endeavor!

20
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:11,720
The one who's moved up to
number one, huh.

21
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,200
At this late hour...

22
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,040
...you're working hard!

23
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,480
Jetburn!

24
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,390
Hey, hey, hey!

25
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,040
I'll run you over, Endeavor!

26
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,090
Mister, get back.

27
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:44,950
Prominence... Burn!

28
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,490
Damn, is this it?

29
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,270
Endeavor...

30
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,330
You were here?

31
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,500
Why didn't you gave us a hand, Hawks?

32
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,930
I just got here, Endeavor-san.

33
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,640
What about the League guys?

34
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,400
They were all doubles made
with Twice's quirk.

35
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,680
What's this?

36
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,430
Probably... a life-support system?

37
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,040
To transport a new type of Nomu or something?

38
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:36,200
What did you say?!

39
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,520
What in the world were Shigaraki and
the others transporting?

40
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,970
I was getting tired of waiting, Nine.

41
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,690
It was worth the wait.

42
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,920
The experiment was a success.

43
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,860
The world became a superhuman society,

44
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,270
and about 80% of the world's population
now has some kind of special trait.

45
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,390
Superhuman Society

46
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,730
I, Izuku Midoriya, was quirkless,

47
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,440
but then, I had a fateful meeting with the number one hero, All Might,

48
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:36,290
and he transfered his quirk,
One for All, to me.

49
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,480
U.A. HIGH SCHOOL

50
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:41,570
Afterwards, I enrolled to the hero
course at U.A. High School.

51
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,570
A prestigious school that has
produced many heroes...

52
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,610
...and where I continue to run toward my dream.

53
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:51,410
That's right,

54
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:57,160
this is the story of how I became
the greatest hero.

55
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,110
Hey, girls!

56
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,100
Come hang out with us!

57
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,460
--Yeah, yeah!
--No, thanks.

58
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,520
Don't say tha-

59
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,900
--What the heck?!
--It won't c-come off!

60
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,700
Are you ok?

61
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,160
Ladies.

62
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,970
--Thanks!
--You saved us!

63
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,380
No, that wasn't me just now...

64
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,790
Down! Look down!

65
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,120
Asui, 70 meters past the rocks!

66
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,040
There's a child drowning!

67
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,530
Mommy!
Momm-

68
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,820
A-Are you ok?

69
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,060
Why are you crying?!

70
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,910
Your face's scary...

71
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,660
Swimming forbidden!
Swimming forbidden!

72
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,790
Swimming forbidden past the rocks!

73
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,160
OFF LIMITS

74
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,880
It's dangerous to go past here,
so please don't enter.

75
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,230
--That's amazing!
--Not bad!

76
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,420
This it's not a show...

77
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,680
Shoto-kun, do you think you can make
some more ice please?

78
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:21,510
Sure.

79
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,220
Here you go.

80
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,730
That's too much!

81
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,160
There are so many heroes.

82
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,010
Hmm.

83
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,450
Oh?

84
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,820
Onee-chan?

85
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,770
U.A. Hero Agency!

86
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,530
Okay, I'll send someone right away.

87
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,760
Kaminari-kun, Matsuda-san in the west district said his battery's gone bad again!

88
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,130
Again?

89
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,720
That old man needs to get a new one...

90
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,570
Do your best, Chargezuma!

91
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,060
--Go, go!
--Go, go!

92
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,600
Hi, this is U.A. Hero Agency.

93
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,460
We'll solve anything for you with a sparkle.

94
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,060
You found the lost dog?

95
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,310
Yeah, just now.

96
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,380
Don't worry, the dog's fine.

97
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:15,370
Good work.
Next you'll be looking for a parrot.

98
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,300
My little brother's lost!
I can't find him anywhere!

99
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,410
It's ok, calm down.

100
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:25,220
--First, what are your names?
--Don't worry. Yes!

101
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,900
Iida-kun, granny Sato hurt her back!

102
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:30,850
Got it!

103
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,890
I will rush over at once!

104
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,400
There's a lost child in the shopping arcade!

105
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,440
Any heroes who are free right now-

106
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:38,960
No way.

107
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:39,760
That was fast.

108
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,400
Don't say that, Bakugo.

109
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,150
Uraraka, I'll go with you-

110
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,040
NABU ISLAND GUIDEBOOK

111
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,740
You can't find a lost kid with your quirk!

112
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,010
If we're looking for a lost kids...

113
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,120
...then it's my turn.

114
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,680
Uraraka, I'll go too.

115
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,140

00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:02,050
One for All: Full Cowling... 8%!

120
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,190
Hero Agency!

121
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,400
Class 1-A!

122
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:09,740
Heading out!

123
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:18,470
The twenty of us in U.A. High School's
hero course Class 1-A...

124
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,780
...have come to Nabu Island, an island far
from the main island of Japan.

125
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:28,440
Even though we've acquired our
provisional hero licenses,

126
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:33,640
why are us students even working as
heroes on this island?

127
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:37,180
LAST MONTH AT U.A. HIGH SCHOOL

128
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:37,020
Of course, there's a reason behind this...

129
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,770
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

130
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:41,940
Placing hero course students in areas with no pro heroes...

131
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:45,590
A practical hero work recommendation project?

132
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:51,010
Yes, the current superhuman
society is in chaos.

133
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:57,820
You, the number one hero and
Symbol of Peace,

134
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,540
are officially retired.

135
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,670
The villains are gaining power
because of that.

136
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,220
Are you saying that in order to
go up against them,

137
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:10,250
it's imperative that we train like this the next
generation of heroes?

138
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,350
The superiors at the Heroes Public
Safety Commission think so.

139
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:18,420
Well, I'm sure you have your
thoughts about this,

140
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,600
but I hope you will cooperate with us.

141
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,690
The hero work recommendation project.

142
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:30,130
You all will be stationed on Nabu Island,
an outlying island in southern Japan.

143
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:38,910

due to old age.

147
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:38,900
You all will work as heroes there
until a successor arrives.

148
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,060
That's super hero-like!

149
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,170
I mean, we will be heroes!

150
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,740
Excited, yey!

151
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,860
I'm bursting with eagerness!

152
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,610
This isn't an internship or a work study.

153
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,130
It's real hero work...

154
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,410
I've wanted to be one since I was little...

155
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,520
Finally, I will...

156
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,730
Listen to what I have to say
until the end!

157
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:05,560
Good.

158
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:11,690
As a rule, you will not have backup from
any teachers or pro heroes.

159
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:16,380
Of course, if something happens, you will
bear the responsibility for it.

160
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:20,600
Bear that in mind, and behave
as a hero should.

161
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:21,900
Understand?

162
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,760
Yes!

163
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,980
Mahoro-chan, where are you?

164
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,960
Where are you, Maho-

165
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,740
Katsuma-kun?

166
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,540
You're Katsuma Shimano, right?

167
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,750
A hero...

168
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,460
You've been separated from your
big sister, right?

169
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,750
Now come with me-

170
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,310
You're late!
Way too late!

171
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:03,450
Onee-chan!

172
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:04,710
What's your name!

173
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:06,700
I'm D-Deku!

174
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,700
Um... and you are?

175
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,550
I'm Katsuma's older sister, Mahoro!

176
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:16,240
Eh, I guess you found him already...

177
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,840
I'm glad.

178
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,700
That's not to be glad at all!

179
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:23,050
Why did it take over an hour to find a lost kid?!
Explain yourself!

180
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:26,060
You're part of that famous U.A.'s hero course
but you are useless!

181
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:30,360
If this is what we get, then maybe that grandpa
hero we had before would do better.

182
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,660
I-I'm sorry...

183
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:36,450
Well, nothing you can do.
You are just a high school student after all.

184
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,360
I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry...

185
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,490
Deku-kun?

186
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,520
Next time, make sure you do your job
properly, okay, Deku?

187
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,320
G-Got it, I'll try harder...

188
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,650
Let's go, Katsuma!

189
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:50,280
Eh?

190
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,140
Ah... okay...

191
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,390
Um...

192
00:12:58,530 --> 00:12:59,480
Thanks...

193
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,790
You don't have to thank him!

194
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,830
Deku-kun, what's going on?

195
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,210
What are you apologizing for?

196
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,110
I got scolded for taking too long
at finding a lost kid.

197
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,290
Huh? What the heck?

198
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,640
But, I'm glad...

199
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,180
About what?

200
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,010
That Katsuma-kun was able to get
back to his sister safely.

201
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:29,290
Deku-kun, you really feel like
Deku-kun, huh.

202
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,130
Eh? What do you mean?

203
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,710
That you're a hero to the bone!

204
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:38,900
=========

205
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:38,900
==========

206
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:38,900
NABU CORNER
STORE

207
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:38,900
RESTROOM

208
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,570
Those heroes were useless like I thought.

209
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:43,990
It's not like a small island like this has
any crimes in the first place.

210
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,380
I'm sure they're probably especially bad,
even among U.A. students.

211
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,670
They came to look for me though.

212
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,410
That boy was definely a hero.

213
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,000
Then I'll be the one to unmask
who he really is.

214
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,450
Onee-chan!

215
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,550
AT THE SAME TIME

216
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:12,930
I wonder if the Class A students are
being proper heroes...

217
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,840
The population of Nabu island is of 1000 people.

218
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:19,020
In the last 30 years, they've only
had trivial crimes.

219
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,100
Anyway, I'm sure they'll be fine.

220
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:27,190
Besides, being a hero doesn't mean facing
huge disasters by yourself.

221
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:30,260
or fighting evil villains like you did.

222
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:36,080
Interacting with those they protect will also be an important experience for them.

223
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,860
I'm exhausted...

224
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:46,650
We've gone Plus Ultra beyond what's allowed
by the Labor Standards Act.

225
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,940
Class Reps, don't you think we've taken
too many small jobs?

226
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,780
We shouldn't treat small and big
jobs differently.

227
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:57,450
Even if we're working as heroes,
we are still students.

228
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,620
We must do them faithfully and earn the trust
of the people on the island.

229
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:07,060
Excuse me! There's someone here who hasn't done
any hero work since we got here.

230
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:10,260
I've been staying in the office on purpose!

231
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,300
What're you gonna do if a villain comes out while you jerks are out, huh?!

232
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,910
There aren't any villains on this island.

233
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,920
Excuse us.

234
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:22,950
Mayor-san.

235
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:26,570
Thank you for carrying granny Sato to
the hospital earlier.

236
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,530
Thank you for fixing my bike.

237
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,870
And for my battery!

238
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:32,730
And for keeping the beach safe!

239
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,490
Here's some fresh fish!

240
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:39,000
It's not meant to replace our gratitude, but please eat these if you'd like.

241
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,940
Thanks for the food!

242
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,650
You people! Show some restraint!

243
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,430
I'm sorry for you going to all this trouble.

244
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:51,960
Oh no, it's really have been a big help
having you all here.

245
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,570
We're counting on you from now on, too.

246
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,030
Of course!

247
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,320
We will do our very best to carry out our duty.

248
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,900
Thanks for the food!

249
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,620
That was delicious.

250
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,400
I can feel the kindness of
people in my body.

251
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,130
It's moments like these that make me
glad I became a hero.

252
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:12,960
Yeah.

253
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,570
Kacchan of the Bakugos!

254
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,040
We're gonna take baths and go to sleep.

255
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,690
So we're counting on you for the night watch!

256
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,120
Why me?!

257
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,440
Because you haven't done anything all day.

258
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:37,160
1365, 1366...

259
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:42,800
--1367, 1368...
--I will tell you the truth...

260
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:49,000
My quirk, has the power to
transfer power.

261
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,770
One for All.

262
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,650
One person cultivates the power,

263
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,820
and passes it on to another person,
who also cultivates it.

264
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:04,010
It's the crystallization of power that unites
the voices of those who need help

265
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,620
in the hearts of the brave.

266
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,150
And next, it's your turn.

267
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,870
Now that you have inherited One for All,

268
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,730
you may one day have to fight against
this great evil...

269
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,740
Next, it's your turn.

270
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:35,930
Right now, I can only use 20% of
One for All at most.

271
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:42,040
I need to work harder, so I can make
this quirk my own.

272
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,570
Kacchan!

273
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,090
Oh, good work on patrol-

274
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,910
Looks like you've grown a bit, with
your One for All...

275
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,490
Not here, someone might
hear about this...

276
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:01,930
I'm impatient.

277
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,700
I know that better than anybody...

278
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:07,030
I've known you since we were kids.

279
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,020
So hurry up and make your quirk your own...

280
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,200
and fight me!

281
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,220
I'll prove it to you, that I'm the one who
will become the number one hero.

282
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,400
Yes, I will definitely make my quirk my
own and show you...

283
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:34,520
...in order to become the greatest hero!

284
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:38,240
And I'll be even better than the greatest.

285
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:46,540
Um...

286
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,310
You're from this morning...

287
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,560
A-A villain's...

288
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,710
came out!

289
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:55,900
A villain?!

290
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,050
Tell me more!

291
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,680
HEROES PUBLIC SAFETY COMMISSION

292
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:05,770
There have been continuous acts of violence
against heroes since last week.

293
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:11,010
All the victims were knocked unconscious,
and they all lost their quirks.

294
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:17,600
Shigaraki and his group have acquired a Quirk-Erasing needle manufactured by a disbanded villain group.

295
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,930
Do we have reports of them succeeding
in their mass production?

296
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:23,860
No, we don't.

297
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,460
Then investigate.

298
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,540
Continue your secret inves-

299
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,020
Have you thought about the possibility
that their quirks were stolen?

300
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:31,770
What?

301
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,290
The victims were heroes,

302
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,920
so the lost quirks were naturally
only useful ones.

303
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:45,130
If the suspect has a quirk that can steal
quirks like All for One...

304
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,320
That's...

305
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,260
Well, either way, it's related to Shigaraki.

306
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,300
I'll try investigating both possibilities.

307
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,490
So, where did the cargo end up?

308
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:01,980
The heroes didn't collect it, right?

309
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,660
Yeah, that's been confirmed.

310
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,640
What was in the cargo anyway?

311
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,400
According to the doctor, there's no
need for us to know.

312
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:15,450
What the hell?

313
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,370
He just makes us do the transporting,
but he won't tell us anything?!

314
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,730
Doesn't it make you even more curious?

315
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,670
Anyway, forget about it.
Okay?

316
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:24,690
Roger!

317
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,020
Don't want to!

318
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,120
Shigaraki Tomura.

319
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,780
Do not touch that.

320
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,920
Forget about it.

321
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:36,760
Doctor...

322
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,950
KYUSHU REGION

323
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:51,300
You said the next time you can come home
was in 10 days, right?

324
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:54,050
Daddy, do your best at work!

325
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,730
You don't have to worry about us.

326
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:59,660
I will take good care of Katsuma.

327
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:03,180
Thanks, Mahoro, Katsuma.

328
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,800
I will bring you as many souvenirs as--

329
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,880
I've finally found it...

330
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,640
F-Found what...?

331
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,290
Don't worry, I won't kill you.

332
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:28,410
But, I'll take your quirk.

333
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,530
We finally got it, huh?

334
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,530
With this, we can make it reality...

335
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:20,500
The new world... that we desire!

336
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:25,840
Nine?!

337
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:30,780
Wh-Why? Why...?

338
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,950
It doesn't work on type B blood.

339
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:36,930
What?!

340
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,900
After coming this far, we're back to
square one?! Damn it!

341
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,250
No there's still a way.

342
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,420
Daddy, do your best at work!

343
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:49,600
--You don't have to worry about us.
--I see...

344
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,450
Quirks are...

345
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:54,010
...inherited.

346
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:59,190
Why are you here too, shitty Deku?!

347
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,900
Why you say? Because if there
really is a villain...

348
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:04,250
I'll be fine by myself!

349
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:07,040
Hey, where did you saw that villain?

350
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,510
I-Inside those castle ruins!

351
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,190
Tell me that first!

352
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:14,400
Onee-chan...!

353
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,800
Over there!

354
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,590
Go hide.

355
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,210
Katsuma-kun!

356
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:29,780
Stun Grenade!

357
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:34,740
This guy's...

358
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:37,750
Kacchan!

359
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:42,770
Huh?

360
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:51,730
Ouch!

361
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:54,120
The villain's...

362
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,920
Ow, ow... Jeez!

363
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,810
At least get a little scared!

364
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:01,430
Th-That girl...

365
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:05,850
You're the one who made that
villain illusion?

366
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,200
Huh?! How did you know it
was an illusion?

367
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,280
It's obvious!

368
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:13,430
There's no shadow!

369
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,650
Hey, damn kid...

370
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:19,490
Are you having fun
taunting heroes, huh?!

371
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:26,760
I'm completly different from
your everyday heroes.

372
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:32,260
I'm the one who'll surpass All Might and
become the number one hero,

373
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,920
Bakugo Katsuki!

374
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,960
You picked the wrong person to taunt!

375
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:42,200
D-Don't scold my big sister.

376
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:42,900
Huh?!

377
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,820
Are you her accomplice?
Huh?!

378
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,740
You're going overboard, Kacchan!

379
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,130
Let me go, shitty Deku!

380
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,840
--We should be glad it were just fake villain!
--Don't touch me!

381
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,360
Kids these days have no respect!

382
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,340
Wait damnit!

383
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:03,320
--I told you to stop!
--Don't give me orders!

384
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:11,200
Wh-What's up with that Bakugo guy anyway?

385
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:14,140
What's with that
"I'll become the number one hero" thing?

386
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,740
Isn't he confusing it with the ranking
of heroes who look like villains?

387
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:22,280
But he... came to save us, right?

388
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,270
Katsuma, do you want to be
a hero that badly?

389
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,730
I'm against it.
It's dangerous.

390
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:40,080
Besides I know someone even
cooler than a hero.

391
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,210
Who?

392
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:44,540
Daddy.

393
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:50,450
He is always thinking of us, and protecting us.

394
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,370
I want you to be as cool as that.

395
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,680
Among the victims, there's another
one who lost his quirk.

396
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,830
But this time, he isn't a hero.

397
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,580
On top of that, everything that can be used
to indentify him has been stolen.

398
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:19,110
The suspect doesn't want anyone to
know what quirks he stole...?

399
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,800
Why does he need to hide this?

400
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:28,880
Hello! This is U.A.'s Hero Agency!

401
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,420
Your travel bag has gone missing?

402
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,120
Okay, we'll send someone right away!

403
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,530
At the shopping arcade, a tourist
said she lost her luggage--

404
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,890
Ok, ok! I'll go, I'll go!

405
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,130
Aoyama-kun, come with me!

406
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,020
Oui!

407
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,520
Another lost item...?

408
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:45,540
People should at least try to-

409
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:48,860
The client sounded really cute on the phone.

410
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:52,690
I can't just leave someone in trouble!

411
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:56,280
Shoji is asking for more support on the beach!

412
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:57,660
Then I'll go.

413
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,350
I'll go on a regular patrol.

414
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,890
I'll go out too, to help with the
fields at Nijima-san.

415
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:08,940
I'm off!

416
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:14,870
Katsuma...-kun?

417
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,450
Is something wrong?

418
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,400
U-Um...

419
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,910
S-Sorry about yesterday...

420
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:27,620
You are so well-mannered!
You came to apologize?

421
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,480
It's ok, I'm not mad.

422
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:35,380
Will you tell the other hero I'm sorry too?

423
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,980
Sure, I'll tell him.

424
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:41,160
But Katsuma-kun, why did you do that yesterday?

425
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,650
My big sister hates heroes.

426
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,420
Yesterday she said that when villains are around,

427
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,800
the heroes would be too scared, and
wouldn't come save me.

428
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:55,050
so that's why, I...

429
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,170
You believed in us.

430
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,220
Huh?

431
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:04,240
You believed that we will go and save you, right?

432
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:06,960
That's why you came to get us.

433
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:09,610
Yeah.

434
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,560
Oh, that pin--

435
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,650
It's the Ninja Hero: Edgeshot, right?

436
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,370
Yup!

437
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,040
Do you also want to be a hero, Katsuma-kun?

438
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,840
My quirk isn't good for being a hero.

439
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:28,470
Besides... onee-chan say's it's dangerous.

440
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,400
You're part of that famous U.A.'s
hero course, but you're useless!

441
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:41,480
I see, it's not like Mahoro-chan hates heroes, it's that
she's worried about Katsuma-kun.

442
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,640
Izuku, I can't take this anymore...

443
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,640
You keep getting hurt...

444
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:49,780
Your mom's heart can't take it anymore.

445
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,160
Hey, Katsuma-kun.

446
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,800
What kind of hero do you want to be?

447
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,860
A strong hero who can
beat up evil villains.

448
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:13,580
I see... I want to be a hero who can
save people in trouble.

449
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:19,050
Save people in trouble...?

450
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:19,850
Yeah.

451
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,600
Katsuma-kun, you want to be a hero who can defeat
the enemy to save people.

452
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:28,810
But I want to save the people in order
to defeat the enemy.

453
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,700
The order is different, but what we
are aiming for is the same.

454
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,360
I think we both want to be the greatest heroes.

455
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:38,390
That's why...

456
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:41,410
...let's both do our best.

457
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,260
Yeah.

458
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,490
Oh, but we should try not to worry
our families too much.

459
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,220
Yeah!

460
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,700
Little Katsuma really loves heroes, doesn't he?

461
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,160
Here, take this.

462
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:03,300
Thank you very much, Suzumura-san!

463
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,790
Please be kind to him.

464
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:11,960
They lost their mother when
they were very young.

465
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:15,450
Their father works away from home
almost the entire year,

466
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:18,770
so him and Mahoro-chan,
live on their own.

467
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,930
Of course, we in the neighborhood
look after them.

468
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:27,660
But it's lonely to not have parents
around at that age.

469
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,530
Onee-chan!

470
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:38,460
Where did you go, Katsuma?

471
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,130
To see Deku-niisan.

472
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,110
I went to say sorry for what
happened yesterday.

473
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:44,860
Why?

474
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,240
I love daddy.

475
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:53,030
I want to be someone as cool as daddy.

476
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:54,890
But...

477
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:57,010
But...!

478
00:30:59,030 --> 00:30:59,960
Wh-What's this?!

479
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,900
The cruise is...

480
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:05,760
Why's the cruise coming this way...?

481
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,180
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

482
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:07,880
Run!

483
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:15,190
What... what's going on?

484
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,550
Chimera, Mummy, I don't want to be interrupted.

485
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,160
You two are in charge of diversions.

486
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,000
A preference of some kind?

487
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,260
As you see fit.

488
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,550
Roger.

489
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:29,080
--Slice...
--I know.

490
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,720
Villains...

491
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,660
Those are definely villains!

492
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:45,270
Onee-chan, let's call the heroes!

493
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,440
But they are still students--

494
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,710
Deku-niisan would definitely save us!
I'm sure of it!

495
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:53,270
I finished working the fields!

496
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,510
Welcome back, Midoriya-kun.

497
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,660
Good work!

498
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,950
What is it?
If it's some lame job-

499
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,560
Villains appeared at the fishing harbor!

500
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,140
That voice...

501
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,830
You're the damn kid from
yesterday, aren't you?

502
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:12,840
--Don't think that you can keep tricking us-
--I'm not lying! Bakugo it's true!

503
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,040
Hi, Deku here!

504
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,560
--Bastard-
--At the fishing harbor-

505
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,650
What did Mahoro-chan say?

506
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:22,730
========

507
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:22,730
NABU  ISLAND
BASE  TRANSCEIVER  STATION

508
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:26,100
Communications have been cut off.

509
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:27,840
Next is...

510
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,890
I hope it's still a joke...

511
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,090
Anyway, I'll go to the fishing port!

512
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:40,180
--Thank you very much.
--Thank you very much.

513
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:42,630
Isn't it great, Maa-kun?

514
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,410
Yeah, Mii-chan.

515
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:49,180
What the heck? She has a boyfriend!
Damn that Ashido...

516
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,830
Hey, what was that?

517
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:57,090
Heroes! A v-villain...!

518
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:02,600
It's seriously a villain!

519
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:03,930
That's too sudden!

520
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:05,860
W-We need to do something!

521
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,730
Aoyama, use your laser!

522
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,890
It's called "Navel Laser"!

523
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:18,820
Oh? Three heroes in the middle
of nowhere.

524
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,410
He just made more!

525
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:36,540
Hagakure, did you contact the office?!

526
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:38,500
I can't reach them!

527
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,500
I don't have any signal!

528
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,350
No way!

529
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:44,970
If I keep shooting like this...
my tummy will...

530
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,370
Damn it!

531
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:48,180
What should we do?!

532
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,090
Froppy, Tentacole!

533
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:54,240
Evacuating everyone is our first priority!

534
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,050
I know!

535
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,020
Get away from here, quickly.

536
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:00,410
Twirling Tail Dance!

537
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:04,700
What are you after?

538
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,180
Why are you doing this?

539
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,850
You're quite young for a hero.

540
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:13,980
Tokoyami!

541
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:15,120
Sorry I'm late!

542
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:16,600
Dark Shadow!

543
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:17,670
Got it!

544
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,240
We can't use our phones!

545
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:27,340
Go back to the office and get help!

546
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:27,970
But-

547
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,290
I'll hold things as I can here!

548
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,050
Huh? My phone has no signal.

549
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:37,000
You're right.

550
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:37,900
Mine, too.

551
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,710
And mine.

552
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,370
What's going on?

553
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,410
Don't tell me...

554
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,030
This is bad!

555
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,770
Villains appeared!

556
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:45,740
Villains?!

557
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,830
They're attacking the shopping arcade!

558
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:50,010
Some heroes are fighting
with him but...!

559
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:50,880
Reporting in!

560
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,900
A villain has appeared at the beach!

561
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:53,770
What?!

562
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,330
Ojiro and the others are fighting
a defensive battle.

563
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:56,680
They're asking for help!

564
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:57,490
Iida-kun!

565
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,290
There's no time to hesitate.

566
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,090
Everyone here split up into two groups,
and deal with the villains!

567
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,090
Bakugo-kun, Kirishima-kun and Kaminari-kun,

568
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,220
you will intercept the villain
at the shopping arcade.

569
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:11,100
Yaoyorozu, Jiro and Ashido,

570
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,720
you will take care of the evacuation
at the shopping arcade!

571
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:17,300
Todoroki-kun, Sato-kun, Sero-kun
and Tokoyami-kun

572
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,820
will come with me to the beach!

573
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:20,810
Uraraka-san and Koda-kun,

574
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:23,040
you will take care of the evacuation
at the beach.

575
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,260
We're in a race against time.

576
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,100
We are the only heroes on this island.

577
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:31,660
And we are the only ones who can save
the people of this island!

578
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:36,000
U.A.'s High School hero course,
Class 1-A, heading out!

579
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,380
The fishing harbor!

580
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,450
I need to tell everyone!

581
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:42,600
No signal...!

582
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,480
Villains have came to this island.

583
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:51,060
Probably the others will go face them right after they will find out about this.

584
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,890
If that's so, then I must make sure that
Mahoro-chan is safe.

585
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:57,380
Their house is...

586
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:01,190
Of course, we in the neighborhood
look after them.

587
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,440
...close to Suzumura-san's house!

588
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,620
My tummy hurts...

589
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:20,040
My head also reached it's limit...

590
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:22,890
Mineta-kun! Aoyama-kun!

591
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:29,250
This place is full of useless people!

592
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,520
Just like these extras!

593
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:32,760
Bakugo-kun?!

594
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,480
Red Riot is here!

595
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,420
Chargebolt is also here!

596
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:43,500
Guys!

597
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,160
They are your friends?

598
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:46,890
Everyone!

599
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,850
Yaomomo! Girls!

600
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:52,010
Let's go help evacuating the
people out of here.

601
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:52,570
Got it!

602
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:55,460
AP Shot - Auto Cannon!

603
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,520
Damn!

604
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,300
Thanks!

605
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:04,730
Bakugo!

606
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,080
Shit!

607
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:09,690
What the hell's this-

608
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:14,480
Everything I catch with my bandages moves
according to my will!

609
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,930
It doesn't work with living things, but it does
work with what they are wearing.

610
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:22,940
Your suit, clothes and equipment
will act as I order!

611
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:27,060
Bakugo!

612
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,910
I'll crush your friends with your own hands!

613
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:41,670
Ojiro-kun!

614
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,250
Octoblow!

615
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,000
With this shape...

616
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:49,610
many people would make fun
of you, right?

617
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:52,800
Don't you hate your parents for this?!

618
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:00,300
Shoji-kun!

619
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,860
Leave it to me!

620
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,610
Ojiro, I'm counting on you!

621
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,400
Now!

622
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:07,880
Tokoyami-kun, Sato-kun!

623
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,440
Sugar... Rush!

624
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:13,490
This can't stop me!

625
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:20,790
Sato!

626
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,110
Hey, hey...

627
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,960
Although you are only kids, this
is going overboard.

628
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,470
Onee-chan, we have to notify the heroes
about villains!

629
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:35,330
Cell phones don't work so we
can't do anything.

630
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:38,200
Let's go home first, and tell
everyone after--

631
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:47,140
Our house...

632
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:51,170
Found it.

633
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,290
Type B cellular activation.

634
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,540
Young man...

635
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:59,380
I will take your quirk.

636
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:03,960
Don't worry, I won't kill you.

637
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:05,600
Stay away!

638
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:11,720
I said stay away!

639
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:15,730
I already know that's an illusion.

640
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,840
Onee-chan...

641
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,020
Deku-niisan!

642
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:31,350
A super-strength type quirk.

643
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:34,880
Everything's fine, can you run?

644
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:35,800
Yes.

645
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,640
Hurry, get away from here.

646
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:38,770
Yes.

647
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:44,620
Stop!

648
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,140
Why are you after those children?

649
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:50,380
Back off.

650
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:52,020
I'm not moving from here!

651
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:54,890
If you stay in the way, I'll kill you.

652
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,570
Air wall?

653
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:01,040
So that's your power!

654
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:07,740
Did he shoot lightning bolts?

655
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:10,820
It seems like he
has two independent quirks.

656
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:13,490
It's almost like...

657
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:17,170
All For One.

658
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,640
Stop it, Bakugo!

659
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,480
He fully controls him.

660
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:27,990
What do we do, Kirishima?

661
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:29,510
What do we do, you say...

662
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:30,470
Damn!

663
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,500
S-Shit...!

664
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,230
Choose.

665
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,600
You can become one of my puppets...

666
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,150
or you can be defeated by your friend.

667
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:45,020
Shut up!

668
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:48,220
W-What?

669
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:52,660
Do not underestimate me!

670
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,240
Damn shitty mummy!

671
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,910
He sacrificed his own weapon...

672
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:15,730
I still have a lot of capacity left.

673
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:19,450
Maximum output!

674
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,740
Die!

675
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,520
You did it, Bakugo!

676
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:35,270
And with minimal damage to buildings.

677
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,580
Guys!

678
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:37,580
And the villain?

679
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:40,390
Huh? He's slightly injured.

680
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:42,130
And the people?

681
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,570
We evacuated them all towards
the west area.

682
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,460
Where are you going, Bakugo?

683
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:49,110
Take care of the evacuation!

684
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:52,230
I'll smash the remaining villains!

685
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:01,700
Shit...

686
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,530
He has us cornered with his power.

687
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:05,540
Iida, what can we do?

688
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,780
For now I just think we should keep this
on the sidelines.

689
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:11,320
At least until we finish moving the
people somewhere else.

690
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:14,710
Black Ankh!

691
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:18,530
Recipro... Burst!

692
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,600
You are so persistent, heroes!

693
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,090
If this continues...

694
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:41,940
Delaware Smash...

695
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:43,910
Air Force!

696
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,650
Air projectiles...

697
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,010
What an interesting way to use it.

698
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:57,450
I must keep attacking him if I don't want him to come
closer to Katsuma-kun and his sister!

699
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:05,130
He also has a quirk to launch
air projectiles!

700
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:07,360
How many more does he have?

701
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:12,650
If I can't know what your
quirks are, then I must hit first!

702
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:17,160
One For All, Full Cowling!

703
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,690
20%!

704
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,740
His power increased.

705
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,300
With this power I can...!

706
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:33,010
St. Louis... Smash!

707
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,980
20% wasn't enough!

708
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,580
This power...

709
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:44,850
This quirk...

710
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:48,000
It's worth stealing.

711
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:51,180
"Stealing"?

712
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:52,930
He said he can take it.

713
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:56,610
As I thought, you have the same quirk
as All for One...

714
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:59,570
He'll steal my One For All!

715
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:08,710
I couldn't steal it.

716
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:12,080
No, rather, it's essence won't
fit in my body.

717
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:14,820
This guy...

718
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:19,340
That quirk of yours has incredible potential.

719
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,180
I have to move...

720
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:23,720
Move! Move...!

721
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,390
It's existence is very intriguing.

722
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:30,290
But that's why, I have to destroy it.

723
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,630
Did he throw me with the air wall?

724
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:37,190
Deku-niisan?

725
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:40,120
Deku-niisan!

726
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:42,720
Run away!

727
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:43,520
But...!

728
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,160
Just hurry, run away.

729
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,780
That guy's objective is...

730
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,240
Deku-niisan!

731
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:02,250
Hurry... run away!

732
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:03,890
But...

733
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:07,760
No...

734
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,420
No...

735
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:12,880
N-No!

736
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,610
What's that?

737
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,500
Deku...-kun?

738
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,090
Someone, please...

739
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,890
Protect Deku!

740
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,490
An explosive quirk.

741
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:36,080
I finally found you, damn villain.

742
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:37,560
Kacchan...

743
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:39,740
He's...

744
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:40,940
Bakugo!

745
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:43,180
Brats, look closely here!

746
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:46,450
I will become the number one hero...

747
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:48,530
...with my strength!

748
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,170
You are done!

749
00:45:59,460 --> 00:45:59,880
Kacchan!

750
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:01,810
Shit... shit...!

751
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:04,200
Damn...

752
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:06,490
Kacchan...

753
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:09,000
That guy has multiple quirks.

754
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:10,800
And he can steal quirks!

755
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:13,940
Is All for One back?

756
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:17,440
In that case, it would be best
to finish him fast!

757
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:21,280
I already know that trick!

758
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:29,650
I'm way too strong for you!

759
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:42,370
Damn it...! From where did
this come from?

760
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,850
Move... Move!

761
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,710
Move!

762
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,050
You're just like a dog in pain.

763
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:52,620
That will...

764
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:54,210
be you!

765
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:58,370
Shitty Deku!

766
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:09,270
Detroit... Smash!

767
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:17,800
What's happening here?

768
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:19,780
What's going on?

769
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:21,610
The electricity is...

770
00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:29,410
Now...

771
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:36,180
I won't let you...

772
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:37,690
go...

773
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:40,850
This fight it's still...

774
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:42,800
not ended...

775
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,120
Deku-niisan...

776
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:45,760
Bakugo...

777
00:47:48,810 --> 00:47:51,640
Heroes really are...

778
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:01,800
He's in pain...?

779
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,220
Why?

780
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:04,730
Nine!

781
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:07,260
Hang in there, Nine!

782
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:09,730
The boy is...

783
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,100
Got it.

784
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:14,940
Stay still.

785
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:19,590
Don't worry.

786
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:20,630
We're on your side.

787
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:21,660
Over here!

788
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:24,170
Tsuyu-chan!

789
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,010
~Ribbit~!

790
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:32,680
Go after them...

791
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:36,870
No matter what, that child...

792
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:37,730
Nine...

793
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:40,140
They won't leave this island.

794
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:42,500
For now you need to rest.

795
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:47,660
So that's as far as we go...

796
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,420
You'll keep your lives for
today, little heroes!

797
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:54,890
Did he run away?

798
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,320
It's more appropriate to say
that he spared us.

799
00:48:58,720 --> 00:48:59,740
--Shit-!
--Don't go!

800
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,610
It might be a trap.

801
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,850
We couldn't even win by
outnumbering him.

802
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,080
Trying alone is very dangerous.

803
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:08,010
But...

804
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:10,280
Now's more important to guarantee
everyone's safety.

805
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:12,640
That's also our job as heroes.

806
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:35,360
You two are using your quirks too much.

807
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:37,980
We... don't know when they will
attack us again.

808
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:41,650
If we don't do it now, there won't be...

809
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:43,410
You're already reaching your limit...

810
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:47,320
Here.

811
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:48,700
Thank you.

812
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,420
It's hot so be careful.

813
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,240
Take one per person!

814
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:54,330
There's enough for everyone!

815
00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:00,370
What happened to the villains?

816
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:01,920
Don't worry.

817
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:04,570
We will take care of them and
will protect you all.

818
00:50:07,850 --> 00:50:10,060
I'm glad this island han an abundance
of food on it.

819
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:12,250
What happened to the
villain they caught?

820
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:15,540
He's locked in the machine room.

821
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,080
But no matter how much you question him,
he doesn't want to tell us anything.

822
00:50:23,370 --> 00:50:25,850
Todoroki-kun, how are Deku-kun
and the others doing?

823
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:27,930
They still didn't regained consciousness.

824
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:31,720
The doctors are treating them.

825
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:37,380
Thank you very much.

826
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:38,920
Sorry.

827
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:43,030
With our quirks we are hardly able
to close their wounds.

828
00:50:43,830 --> 00:50:45,570
There is nothing we can do
about their fractures...

829
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,520
For that it's necessary to take
them to the hospital

830
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,860
I can help a bit.

831
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,060
Katsuma-kun?

832
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:58,650
Katsuma's quirk has the power
to activate cells.

833
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,740
We don't know if it could help with
the wounds, but...

834
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:05,200
They got hurt trying to save us!

835
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:06,360
That's why...

836
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:10,230
We would appreciate it, little one.

837
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:11,030
Got it!

838
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:14,660
I have to save them...

839
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,000
No...

840
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:19,350
I will save you!

841
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:27,670
How's Nine?

842
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:28,980
He will be fine.

843
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:31,520
In a few more hours he'll
be up again.

844
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:33,430
But Mummy?

845
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:34,890
He's not here?

846
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:37,680
It can't be, the heroes...

847
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:39,060
No way...

848
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:42,970
Either way, we must
continue with this as it was planned.

849
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:44,800
For sure.

850
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:46,660
No matter what.

851
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:00,610
Why... did you save me?

852
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:04,610
Come with me.

853
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:11,720
We will destroy this society that calls people
"villains" and "monsters".

854
00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:18,950
We'll create a world that is dominated
only by power.

855
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,040
You'll join the League of Villains?

856
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:33,820
Strictly speaking...

857
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:37,180
I will participate in a League's experiment to
increase the power of quirks.

858
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:39,500
They just want to use you.

859
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:40,760
It's very dangerous!

860
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:50,140
For the objective we have, we
need more power...

861
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:54,980
We... choose you.

862
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,200
You can't abandon us.

863
00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:08,390
I have managed to adapt the quirk
factor of All for One.

864
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,960
Steal 8 more quirks.

865
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:15,280
You became someone able to
use 9 quirks.

866
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,830
The experiment was a success.

867
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,650
We can finally carry out our plan.

868
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:25,720
However, the side effects also worsened.

869
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:30,680
If I use the quirks, the cells and the tissues
of my body will die.

870
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:31,960
But that's...

871
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,650
So that operation didn't make any sense!

872
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:38,320
I must steal a quirk capable of activating
cell tissues.

873
00:53:40,130 --> 00:53:40,790
And so...

874
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:45,130
We can create the world we want.

875
00:53:55,350 --> 00:53:57,440
Katsuma, at least get some sleep.

876
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:58,310
I don't want to.

877
00:53:58,680 --> 00:53:59,430
I must go on.

878
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:00,180
But...

879
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:01,140
I must go on!

880
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:04,200
I can't give up.

881
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,010
Heroes never give up!

882
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,360
Deku-niisan!

883
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:19,430
Bakugo?!

884
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:22,900
I will first give a report of the
current situation.

885
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,620
The electricity and communications
were both destroyed.

886
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:27,410
We can't ask for backup.

887
00:54:28,010 --> 00:54:32,360
A while ago I created a drone with a
distress message.

888
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:34,810
We sent it to search for help.

889
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:40,890
It will take at least 6 hours to arrive,
so help will take even longer.

890
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,570
I don't think the villains will wait
to act until then.

891
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:49,890
For now our highest priority is to
protect the inhabitants.

892
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:51,280
How will we do it?

893
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:55,200
That villain managed to seriously injure
Midoriya and Bakugo!

894
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:58,380
And the one we faced was really
skilled and powerful.

895
00:54:58,870 --> 00:55:03,460
Yaomomo and Kaminari overused their
quirks, so they can't fight for now...

896
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:07,860
And as far as we know, there are still
three villains outside.

897
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:10,960
Not even by attacking them all at once
will assure us a victory.

898
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,830
If we could only know what's
their objective...

899
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:14,900
Yeah...

900
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,140
Then we could at least take some action.

901
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:20,730
I will steal your quirk.

902
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:27,820
Katsum-

903
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,870
I'm the target of those villains!

904
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:32,690
What do you mean?

905
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:35,730
He said he wanted to steal my quirk!

906
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:37,380
Steal your quirk?

907
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:39,940
Is he like All for One?

908
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:42,500
But now we know what his goal is!

909
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:46,120
--If we run away with the child then...
--It will not be that easy.

910
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,530
They are villains.

911
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:52,230
If we run away with the child they could threaten
with murdering the population.

912
00:55:52,790 --> 00:55:54,800
So what can we do?

913
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:00,450
I will let myself be captured!

914
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:02,290
Huh?

915
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:07,140
I'm going to let him steal my quirk,
he said he wouldn't kill me.

916
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:10,160
If that's enough to save everyone...

917
00:56:10,310 --> 00:56:11,250
We won't do that!

918
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:14,840
Deku-kun?

919
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,950
Midoriya-kun! Are you better?

920
00:56:18,850 --> 00:56:20,660
Thanks to Katsuma's quirk.

921
00:56:21,830 --> 00:56:24,150
My quirk isn't good for being a hero.

922
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:27,850
Cell activation.

923
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:30,050
A quirk that favors metabolism.

924
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:32,380
It's as if it were a stimulant
for healing.

925
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:35,210
Thanks to that I was able to recover this much.

926
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:38,020
It is an incredible quirk, Katsuma-kun!

927
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:39,360
Thank you!

928
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:42,420
Deku-niisan...

929
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:46,100
You don't have to be afraid anymore.

930
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:48,890
That's what we are here for.

931
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:56,070
All we have to do is crush those damn
villains good, right?

932
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:57,200
Bakugo!

933
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:02,320
Save to win.

934
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,450
Win to save.

935
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:08,020
If you can recognize these...

936
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:10,680
you will become...

937
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,740
one of the strongest heroes!

938
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:22,520
We will certainly protect you!

939
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:25,740
And I'll crush those villains!

940
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:28,200
We will save the inhabitants of the island!

941
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:29,640
I will definitely win!

942
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:33,410
Bakugo, Midoriya, I'm with you.

943
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:34,660
Me too!

944
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,880
I want to protect the people
of this island.

945
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:38,720
Let's fight!

946
00:57:39,050 --> 00:57:40,460
Jeez, shut up already!

947
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:43,820
I still have to repair Matsuda-san's battery.

948
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:48,450
I also want Sato-san to be able to live
a much happier life!

949
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:50,280
I'm also with you!

950
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:51,120
Me too.

951
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,120
--I'll go!
--Me too!

952
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:54,870
--I also-!
--Yeah!

953
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:56,710
--I'll fight!
--~Ribbit~!

954
00:57:57,210 --> 00:57:58,710
Alright, let's do it!

955
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:00,370
Yeah, let's do it

956
00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:01,670
I guess we have to do it!

957
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:03,690
Because we are heroes!

958
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:05,780
We will show you that there's
no impossibilities

959
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:08,380
What do we always say...

960
00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:10,780
Surpass your limits...

961
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:13,380
Plus Ultra!

962
00:58:16,770 --> 00:58:18,240
Midoriya, what's the strategy?

963
00:58:19,190 --> 00:58:20,820
We have confirmed three villains.

964
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,940
We will make our base in
the castle ruins.

965
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:26,700
So the villains will have only
one escape route.

966
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:31,980
Here we will separate them and from
there we will use the land.

967
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:33,880
I'm will beat them up.

968
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:37,500
We'll shelter the inhabitants in the caves
that are in those ruins.

969
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:40,730
We'll protect Katsuma and Mahoro-chan.

970
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:43,410
We will also secure our escape route.

971
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:46,560
How do we face the one who uses multiple quirks?

972
00:58:47,170 --> 00:58:50,920
When Kacchan and I fought him,
he suddenly seemed to be suffering from something.

973
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:55,180
It's most likely that if he uses his quirks too much,
his body can no longer handle it.

974
00:58:56,070 --> 00:58:59,690
That's why he tries to steal Katsuma-kun's
quirk, to heal himself.

975
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:00,800
I see...

976
00:59:01,190 --> 00:59:02,360
Then will we make him use them?

977
00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:06,690
We will attack him in waves to
make him use up his quirks.

978
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:08,650
To prevent him from stealing ours...

979
00:59:08,930 --> 00:59:11,030
we will attack from distance
as much as possible.

980
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:15,100
If we can defeat him, that's fine,
but if we can't do it...

981
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:17,770
Just resist until help arrives!

982
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:19,270
We will protect everyone.

983
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:21,140
Wrong.

984
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,810
We will certainly win.

985
00:59:28,330 --> 00:59:28,790
Nine!

986
00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:31,240
Our goal is on top of Mount Shiroyama.

987
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:32,740
The heroes are there too.

988
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
A siege?

989
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:39,080
Let's head toward our goal.

990
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,450
The one who will become King doesn't need
to rely on cheap tricks.

991
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,380
They're here.
All three.

992
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:58,120
They're advancing along the
planned route.

993
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:02,310
We are counting on you,
Yaoyorozu-san, Aoyama-kun.

994
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,020
Twenty seconds until the villains
reach the spot...

995
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:09,460
Aoyama-kun, Naval Laser at
maximum output!

996
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:12,100
Charging energy...

997
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:17,120
5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1!

998
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:23,200
Can't stop twinkling... Supernova!

999
01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:30,370
Plus... Ultra!

1000
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:37,350
They separated!

1001
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:42,680
I made these using the last lipids I had!

1002
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:45,940
My final attack!

1003
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:50,950
Where are you aiming-

1004
01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:01,670
First phase... accomplished.

1005
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:03,360
I-I can't anymore...

1006
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:05,940
We've successfully separated them!

1007
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:06,900
Now...!

1008
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:09,440
They're sending them to the
determined points.

1009
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:12,120
So far it's going as planned.

1010
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:15,240
We will certainly protect you all!

1011
01:01:20,770 --> 01:01:24,050
Tape Shot... Trident!

1012
01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:25,890
Release!

1013
01:01:31,830 --> 01:01:32,500
Uraraka!

1014
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:38,280
Sero-kun!

1015
01:01:45,990 --> 01:01:49,020
--We'll make the villain's quirk...
--...use up!

1016
01:01:50,310 --> 01:01:52,100
Let's go!

1017
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:01,510
They separated us.

1018
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:06,970
Shit!

1019
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:07,840
Damn it!

1020
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:11,190
That was close!

1021
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:17,420
Ashido, leave the rest to me.

1022
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:19,880
This is my world.

1023
01:02:21,610 --> 01:02:22,860
Cheeky boy!

1024
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:29,910
Shit...

1025
01:02:30,390 --> 01:02:32,070
They split us up, huh.

1026
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:44,130
All right!

1027
01:02:44,690 --> 01:02:45,560
All according to plan.

1028
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:47,370
No...

1029
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:55,660
Hey, that was cold.

1030
01:02:57,060 --> 01:02:58,340
We meet again.

1031
01:02:58,690 --> 01:02:59,000
Heh.

1032
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:00,300
Stop that...

1033
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:05,370
Today... I'll be serious.

1034
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:08,020
We are also not the same as before!

1035
01:03:08,370 --> 01:03:11,130
Now that all the inhabitants are safe,
we can give our best!

1036
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:12,790
We will stop you.

1037
01:03:13,350 --> 01:03:15,660
Recipro... Burst!

1038
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:18,850
Let's finish this in 10 minutes!

1039
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:19,730
--Got it!
--Roger!

1040
01:03:24,370 --> 01:03:25,590
Bring it on!

1041
01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:31,190
Damn, we can't even slow him down!

1042
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:33,580
Then what about...

1043
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:00,860
It's almost time for our real attack!

1044
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:01,660
Yeah.

1045
01:04:01,910 --> 01:04:03,330
Sero! Uraraka!

1046
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:04,310
Mineta!

1047
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:06,400
Everything's ready!

1048
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:09,050
We're counting on you, Uraraka!

1049
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:18,980
Plus...

1050
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:22,860
...Ultra!

1051
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:37,980
Go, Mineta!

1052
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:41,900
Super Grape Rush!

1053
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:45,930
Take that, and that, and that,
and that, and that!

1054
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:49,860
And that, and that, and that,
and that, and that!

1055
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,730
This was our real attack!

1056
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:55,250
All right!

1057
01:04:55,770 --> 01:04:56,410
W-We did it-

1058
01:04:57,930 --> 01:04:59,440
Hey, are you alright?

1059
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:01,280
Serves you right...

1060
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:03,040
We've sealed you.

1061
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:13,520
He escaped the trap!

1062
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:16,200
The villain's approaching Uraraka
and the others!

1063
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:28,520
In that case...

1064
01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:34,980
--Aoyama-kun!
--Yaomomo!

1065
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:37,200
Now while he's distracted...

1066
01:05:37,730 --> 01:05:38,560
The plan must-

1067
01:05:40,690 --> 01:05:41,530
It's no use.

1068
01:05:45,410 --> 01:05:47,050
Playtime's over.

1069
01:05:58,210 --> 01:05:59,600
So you were alive.

1070
01:06:02,690 --> 01:06:04,920
If you're gonna sleep-talk, then
sleep and die!

1071
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:07,570
Bakugo's joined the fight!

1072
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:08,730
Midoriya!

1073
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:10,490
Take care of Katsuma-kun
and Mahoro-chan!

1074
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:12,940
--Deku-niisan...
--Deku...

1075
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:15,940
We'll defend this place until the end!

1076
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:18,890
Die!

1077
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:23,450
If I can't protect them here...

1078
01:06:23,850 --> 01:06:26,060
then there's no point in
trying to be a hero!

1079
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:31,580
St. Louis Smash!

1080
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:38,490
It doesn't have to be at full power.
Just think about how to make him use his quirks.

1081
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:48,650
X-Catapult!

1082
01:06:58,050 --> 01:06:59,410
Not bad...

1083
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:02,020
You won't go past us...

1084
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:03,720
I'll kill you.

1085
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,680
What's with "This is my world"?!

1086
01:07:13,190 --> 01:07:14,800
Say something like that again!

1087
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:17,440
Is that all you've got?

1088
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:21,900
She's moving a lot.

1089
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:25,770
I just need an opening...

1090
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:28,230
How pathetic!

1091
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,910
Black Ankh: Sabbath!

1092
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:36,920
Now!

1093
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:38,420
Acid Shot!

1094
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:41,580
We'll decide this now!

1095
01:07:44,550 --> 01:07:45,980
How dare you...

1096
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:55,730
Ashido!

1097
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:04,920
You little...!

1098
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:09,140
Th... This is...

1099
01:08:14,730 --> 01:08:16,460
I won't let you get in Nine's way!

1100
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:46,560
Tokoyami-kun!
Dark Shadow is...

1101
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:50,780
Pay attention in what's in front of you!

1102
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:52,040
Got it!

1103
01:08:56,650 --> 01:08:57,650
It's no use!

1104
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,620
Red Gauntlet!

1105
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,160
That itches.

1106
01:09:19,940 --> 01:09:23,140
I told you brats... that it's no use!

1107
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:26,180
M-My body's...

1108
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:30,560
There was a reason for why we were repeating
the same boring moves.

1109
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:33,810
On my legs...
and on Kirishima-kun's hands...

1110
01:09:34,690 --> 01:09:37,610
we smeared a toxic mucus
made by Asui-chan.

1111
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:39,320
You mean "Tsu-chan" right?

1112
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:41,820
Resign yourself, old man.

1113
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:45,680
You are acting so insolent...

1114
01:09:48,010 --> 01:09:49,510
I'll show you...

1115
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:54,130
...why I'm called a monster!

1116
01:09:58,690 --> 01:09:59,460
He's gotten bigger!

1117
01:10:00,410 --> 01:10:02,740
That form make's him look
like Amajiki-senpai.

1118
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:14,290
--Shit...
--Get shelter!

1119
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:32,860
That's were... Iida and the others are!

1120
01:10:33,350 --> 01:10:35,360
They have problems?
I should go-

1121
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:39,820
You can't! We must protect Katsuma-kun
and Mahoro-chan no matter what.

1122
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,250
--Deku-niisan...
--Bakugo...

1123
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:57,350
I won't let you!

1124
01:11:01,830 --> 01:11:02,280
Sero!

1125
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:07,120
I'll make him float and...

1126
01:11:12,850 --> 01:11:13,690
Uraraka-san!

1127
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:16,780
Not... yet...

1128
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:19,240
Bastard...

1129
01:11:22,650 --> 01:11:23,900
How could you?!

1130
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:38,920
We must make him back down.

1131
01:11:39,990 --> 01:11:42,360
At this rate... Katsuma-kun and
Mahoro-chan will...

1132
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:45,510
Damn it...

1133
01:11:59,990 --> 01:12:01,010
This is...

1134
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:09,730
This is it!
He reached his limit!

1135
01:12:19,580 --> 01:12:20,790
That's some crazy power.

1136
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:23,100
We can't even get close to him.

1137
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:26,140
My Recipro will be done soon.

1138
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:29,010
Make an opening for me.

1139
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:31,340
Get me close to him.

1140
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:32,690
And then?

1141
01:12:33,830 --> 01:12:34,770
I have an idea.

1142
01:12:36,860 --> 01:12:37,420
All right.

1143
01:12:38,090 --> 01:12:39,730
This will be our last attack!

1144
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:55,380
Iida, distract him with your Recipro Burst.

1145
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:14,710
--Doesn't this reming you of Kamino?
--It does.

1146
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:18,930
Whatever attack comes, I'll take it and get
you close to him for sure!

1147
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:19,880
Got it!

1148
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:27,890
Unbreakable!

1149
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:41,520
Kirishima!

1150
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:48,410
Go...

1151
01:13:53,980 --> 01:13:56,420
Increase the temperature in
your body to it's maximum limit!

1152
01:13:59,570 --> 01:14:01,020
If I can make this with fire...

1153
01:14:01,490 --> 01:14:02,390
...then I can also do it with ice...

1154
01:14:11,970 --> 01:14:12,490
Todoroki-kun!

1155
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:19,930
Go down, over the limit!

1156
01:14:30,870 --> 01:14:32,550
Freeze!

1157
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:54,180
Hibernate for a while...

1158
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:02,360
D-Did we... do... our job...?

1159
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:07,690
Midoriya... Bakugo...

1160
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:18,640
Kacchan, let's attack in waves!

1161
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,020
Don't give me orders!

1162
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:24,540
I-If I could only get the cell
activation quirk...

1163
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:27,850
Let's hit him good now!

1164
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:33,170
Then I wouldn't... have to
restrain myself!

1165
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:03,130
Deku-niisan...
Bakugo...

1166
01:16:06,550 --> 01:16:09,580
Deku-niisan!
Bakugo!

1167
01:16:14,790 --> 01:16:16,170
Cell activation?

1168
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:17,460
Yes.

1169
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:21,920
However, my quirk won't activate other
cells except those of type A.

1170
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:25,140
It's a quite useful quirk for
helping people.

1171
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:27,570
Shimano-san, do you have a family?

1172
01:16:28,290 --> 01:16:31,240
I'm from Nabu Island, and my daughter
and son live there...

1173
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,130
That's pretty far...

1174
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:36,520
...but Nabu Island is within the culprit's
range of progression.

1175
01:16:38,870 --> 01:16:39,500
Excuse me.

1176
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:42,180
What is it?

1177
01:16:42,710 --> 01:16:46,540
A fishing boat sailing near Kyushu received
an S.O.S. message.

1178
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:50,060
Villains have attacked Nabu Island, and
they request help immediately.

1179
01:16:50,470 --> 01:16:53,010
That's the suspect in Quirk-Loss crimes!

1180
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:54,160
What?!

1181
01:16:54,340 --> 01:16:56,380
Send a rescue team to Nabu Island
immadiately!

1182
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,820
Oh, and contact U.A. High School.

1183
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:01,120
U.A.? Why?

1184
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:05,690
For the practical hero recommendation project
sponsored by the commission,

1185
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:11,340
the U.A.'s hero course students
from Class 1-A went there.

1186
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:15,990
Shoji, take Katsuma-kun and Mahoro-chan
and get out of here.

1187
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:17,850
We're counting on you.

1188
01:17:20,050 --> 01:17:20,650
Got it.

1189
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:24,760
We'll definitely hold him back.

1190
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:25,320
Yeah.

1191
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:30,680
Found you.

1192
01:17:38,330 --> 01:17:39,750
Heartbeat Distortion!

1193
01:17:42,340 --> 01:17:43,560
Tornado Tail Dance!

1194
01:17:47,370 --> 01:17:47,840
Ojiro!

1195
01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:00,230
We have to evacuate...

1196
01:18:10,530 --> 01:18:11,760
Now get away...

1197
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:13,120
Run!

1198
01:18:19,450 --> 01:18:20,930
Both of you, run!

1199
01:18:21,890 --> 01:18:22,700
Hurry!

1200
01:18:23,770 --> 01:18:24,720
Go!

1201
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:44,240
Katsuma, run away.

1202
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:47,040
O-Onee-chan...
I'll be ok, just run!

1203
01:18:48,170 --> 01:18:48,790
Stay away!

1204
01:18:49,430 --> 01:18:51,440
Don't lay a hand on my little brother!

1205
01:18:53,410 --> 01:18:54,960
I said stay away!

1206
01:18:56,370 --> 01:18:57,260
Onee-chan!

1207
01:19:03,410 --> 01:19:08,100
If you don't want her to die,
then come here.

1208
01:19:08,950 --> 01:19:11,040
No! Run!

1209
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:14,050
Run!

1210
01:19:16,050 --> 01:19:21,560
Help me... turn my desire into reality...

1211
01:19:22,850 --> 01:19:24,310
Run... away...

1212
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:27,450
Katsuma...!

1213
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:34,250
Stop it!

1214
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:36,370
I'll protect you!

1215
01:19:36,690 --> 01:19:39,740
I will protect you, onee-chan!

1216
01:19:46,790 --> 01:19:48,900
Smash!

1217
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:58,920
Sorry being late.

1218
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:00,550
Deku-niisan...

1219
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:03,510
You really gave your best, Katsuma-kun.

1220
01:20:04,290 --> 01:20:05,060
You're amazing!

1221
01:20:10,230 --> 01:20:11,960
Bakugo... you're alive!

1222
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:13,260
I told you.

1223
01:20:14,290 --> 01:20:19,250
I will surpass All Might, and become
the number one hero!

1224
01:20:24,550 --> 01:20:26,740
--Run away with Mahoro-chan!
--Got it!

1225
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:28,730
Nee-chan!

1226
01:20:37,530 --> 01:20:40,020
How did you avoid my lighting...?

1227
01:20:40,180 --> 01:20:42,520
You used that on us already!

1228
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:45,420
That's why...

1229
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:49,530
We used that thunder idiot, as lighting rod.

1230
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,650
I-Isn't that... too much?

1231
01:21:01,510 --> 01:21:03,760
Smash!

1232
01:21:04,410 --> 01:21:06,680
Die!

1233
01:21:12,530 --> 01:21:13,210
Over here!

1234
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:22,760
This...

1235
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:25,860
This can't end!

1236
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:30,730
It can't be the end!

1237
01:21:34,410 --> 01:21:42,100
Like I'd let it end like this!

1238
01:22:01,290 --> 01:22:02,380
A tornado!

1239
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:05,450
Damn it, he really can manipulate
the weather...

1240
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:10,920
What should we do?

1241
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:12,920
Katsuma-kun and Mahoro-chan
are still here.

1242
01:22:13,460 --> 01:22:16,420
On top of that, everyone who was
evacuated could be in danger!

1243
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:22,080
Is he planning to destroy the whole island?

1244
01:22:25,330 --> 01:22:27,190
We definitely have to stop him!

1245
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:36,520
One For All... 100%!

1246
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:41,930
I'll blow that away... with everything I've got!

1247
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:48,070
Detroit... Smash!

1248
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:53,280
Howitzer... Impact!

1249
01:22:58,020 --> 01:22:59,080
Deku-niisan!

1250
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:27,010
Onee-chan!

1251
01:23:36,370 --> 01:23:37,140
The entrance!

1252
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:41,060
Sato-kun!

1253
01:23:41,460 --> 01:23:44,020
Leave this to me!
Get everyone further inside!

1254
01:23:53,590 --> 01:23:57,380
E-Even at 100%... it wasn't enough...

1255
01:23:57,690 --> 01:23:59,500
Damn... it...

1256
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:03,940
Even thought I lowered myself
to fight with Deku...

1257
01:24:04,630 --> 01:24:05,540
It's no use.

1258
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:08,890
You won't be able to live with
that level of power.

1259
01:24:09,650 --> 01:24:12,160
Not in the new world I will create.

1260
01:24:13,450 --> 01:24:14,400
New world...?

1261
01:24:16,230 --> 01:24:17,860
Those who have power.

1262
01:24:19,820 --> 01:24:23,510
The strongest will rule over the
weak in my utopia.

1263
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,280
That can't...

1264
01:24:27,460 --> 01:24:29,670
It won't matter if someone's a
villain or a hero.

1265
01:24:30,860 --> 01:24:33,730
Everything's equal before power...

1266
01:24:34,730 --> 01:24:40,300
That's... what a true superhuman
society should be.

1267
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:46,470
Such a selfish assumption...

1268
01:24:47,410 --> 01:24:49,370
You're crazy...!

1269
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:55,120
Are you getting in the new world's way?

1270
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:58,740
Then you should just disappear.

1271
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:00,720
Think...

1272
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:03,130
What would All Might do?

1273
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:07,900
Like I'd let it end here!

1274
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:10,100
Think!

1275
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:12,290
Think!

1276
01:25:13,110 --> 01:25:15,050
I don't plan to lose!

1277
01:25:15,990 --> 01:25:17,620
Think!

1278
01:25:19,210 --> 01:25:20,530
Deku-niisan!

1279
01:25:21,740 --> 01:25:22,820
Bakugo!

1280
01:25:23,110 --> 01:25:24,810
Deku-niisan!

1281
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:28,580
Don't lose!

1282
01:25:30,660 --> 01:25:32,360
So there you were.

1283
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:36,150
Kacchan.

1284
01:25:38,930 --> 01:25:40,570
There's still a way.

1285
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,860
There's only one way to do this!

1286
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:56,600
My quirk was passed on to me like a sacred torch.

1287
01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:59,450
The power to transfer power...

1288
01:26:08,130 --> 01:26:09,450
K-Kacchan...!

1289
01:26:10,470 --> 01:26:15,250
Heroes... really have a lot to protect.

1290
01:26:16,370 --> 01:26:19,570
That's why, I won't lose!

1291
01:26:21,890 --> 01:26:23,520
Deku!

1292
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:29,890
A hero... can always break out of a tough spot!

1293
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:34,420
A way to protect...

1294
01:26:37,690 --> 01:26:39,580
A way to win...

1295
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:45,560
There's only one way!

1296
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:04,700
What...

1297
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:11,480
If you do this, will you still be
able to use it?

1298
01:27:12,810 --> 01:27:15,340
I don't know, but...

1299
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:22,100
All Might still protected us with the embers after he transfered it to me.

1300
01:27:24,070 --> 01:27:26,000
What did you do?!

1301
01:27:27,220 --> 01:27:30,620
With two... One for All...

1302
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:34,420
...we'll save everyone!

1303
01:27:36,620 --> 01:27:38,260
...we'll win!

1304
01:27:44,940 --> 01:27:49,670
You two... should already be dead!

1305
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:05,770
This might be your last time you use it.

1306
01:28:06,470 --> 01:28:09,180
It's alright, there's no other way.

1307
01:28:11,250 --> 01:28:16,470
Also, All Might, would agree if it's you.

1308
01:28:18,620 --> 01:28:24,150
You never shared our secret, and we have
always admired the same person.

1309
01:28:24,770 --> 01:28:25,490
If it's you...

1310
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:30,950
All Might it's so cool!

1311
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:35,620
He's a super cool hero!

1312
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:42,380
No matter how difficult it is, in the end,
good always...!

1313
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:46,120
...wins!

1314
01:28:46,550 --> 01:28:50,000
No matter how hard it's to save
someone, you...

1315
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:53,490
...have to save them!

1316
01:28:55,380 --> 01:28:58,400
Don't make me laugh!

1317
01:28:59,130 --> 01:29:02,620
Detroit...!

1318
01:29:02,730 --> 01:29:07,530
Smash!

1319
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:39,640
What's this...?

1320
01:29:40,620 --> 01:29:43,500
What's this power?!

1321
01:29:48,710 --> 01:29:52,570
You won't stop me... from fulfilling
my dream!

1322
01:29:54,450 --> 01:29:55,590
Kacchan, let's go!

1323
01:29:57,050 --> 01:29:59,440
Don't give me orders!

1324
01:30:00,490 --> 01:30:03,540
You won't stop me!

1325
01:31:44,570 --> 01:31:48,010
This is... the last time...

1326
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:50,320
My last...

1327
01:31:52,490 --> 01:31:53,660
My last...!

1328
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:59,840
Smash!

1329
01:32:20,300 --> 01:32:21,200
Goodbye...

1330
01:32:22,850 --> 01:32:24,000
One for All...

1331
01:32:27,030 --> 01:32:27,880
Thank you.

1332
01:32:36,780 --> 01:32:38,370
Are you okay, Tokoyami-kun?

1333
01:32:41,730 --> 01:32:43,450
Hawks? Why are you...?

1334
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:49,930
I am here to help, and I brought
some company...

1335
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:57,200
All Might...

1336
01:32:58,460 --> 01:33:01,610
Young Midoriya, sorry for being late...

1337
01:33:02,620 --> 01:33:04,310
K-Kacchan...?

1338
01:33:06,490 --> 01:33:09,210
You always care about others first...

1339
01:33:10,940 --> 01:33:14,120
He's hurt badly, but he will be fine,
his life isn't in danger.

1340
01:33:14,820 --> 01:33:16,010
I'm glad...

1341
01:33:17,060 --> 01:33:20,040
We tried... too hard...

1342
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:22,730
I understand...

1343
01:33:25,750 --> 01:33:27,040
All Might...

1344
01:33:29,750 --> 01:33:31,840
I... transferred the...

1345
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:35,650
One for All to Kacchan...

1346
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:38,820
One for All?!

1347
01:33:39,990 --> 01:33:42,410
If we wouldn't have used
two One for All...

1348
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:47,610
We wouldn't have been able to
protect everyone...

1349
01:33:48,390 --> 01:33:54,840
We wouldn't have been able to beat the villain...
That's why, I don't regret it.

1350
01:33:56,040 --> 01:33:57,750
But... I'm sorry...

1351
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:01,480
Even though you choose me as your successor...

1352
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:05,400
Even though you told me I can become a hero...

1353
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:10,880
I wanted to protect everyone with all I've got...

1354
01:34:13,530 --> 01:34:14,560
Young Midoriya...

1355
01:34:16,220 --> 01:34:18,840
I'm so sorry... All Might...

1356
01:34:20,130 --> 01:34:21,160
I'm sorry...

1357
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:25,120
That's why...

1358
01:34:32,290 --> 01:34:37,450
I don't regret transferring One for All
to you either.

1359
01:34:37,750 --> 01:34:39,680
You used it as you knew it's best.

1360
01:34:41,290 --> 01:34:43,130
The crystallization of power that
unites the voices...

1361
01:34:44,260 --> 01:34:49,400
of those who ask for help in a
brave heart...

1362
01:35:04,380 --> 01:35:05,930
One for All is...

1363
01:35:09,050 --> 01:35:12,740
Did young Bakugo passed out before the
completion of the transfer?

1364
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:17,490
No, it's something else.

1365
01:35:18,620 --> 01:35:23,760
It's a quirk for those who sacrifice their
lives to save others...

1366
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:28,220
and the ones who sacrificed it...

1367
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:37,920
Master... and those who preceded us...

1368
01:35:41,450 --> 01:35:43,760
Thank you... very much...!

1369
01:36:35,510 --> 01:36:39,090
What are you planning to do,
Tomura Shigaraki?

1370
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:47,200
As I thought, you're still alive.

1371
01:36:49,050 --> 01:36:50,290
Shigaraki...

1372
01:36:51,350 --> 01:36:52,860
You had a great opportunity.

1373
01:36:54,260 --> 01:36:57,090
Just a little more, just a little...

1374
01:36:57,560 --> 01:37:01,540
Don't worry, I will fulfill your dream.

1375
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:06,310
It takes... only one leader...

1376
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:11,040
That's right, one is enough.

1377
01:37:13,300 --> 01:37:14,970
Sleep, Nine...

1378
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:18,680
Good job.

1379
01:37:25,350 --> 01:37:27,030
Hurts!

1380
01:37:27,340 --> 01:37:29,210
What the hell's this?!

1381
01:37:31,590 --> 01:37:37,640
Undergoing
Treatment

1382
01:37:33,610 --> 01:37:37,770
Kacchan does not remember the transfer
of One for All.

1383
01:37:38,930 --> 01:37:42,000
One for All is still inside me.

1384
01:37:44,740 --> 01:37:46,520
Daddy!

1385
01:37:46,610 --> 01:37:48,310
Mahoro, Katsuma!

1386
01:37:50,450 --> 01:37:55,640
A bit later, Katsuma-kun and Mahoro-chan
meet their father again.

1387
01:37:57,690 --> 01:38:03,650
We were able to protect the people of this
island with very few wounded.

1388
01:38:05,010 --> 01:38:09,160
The program of the public security commission
was suspended, but...

1389
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:12,280
we remained a while longer on the island...

1390
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:15,170
to help as we can with the reconstruction.

1391
01:38:17,900 --> 01:38:20,920
And so, the final day came, and
we had to leave.

1392
01:38:22,250 --> 01:38:24,420
Are we going to leave without saying anything?

1393
01:38:25,890 --> 01:38:28,250
We can't help more in the
reconstruction work.

1394
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:30,800
Now, let's just go quietly.

1395
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:32,490
That's very typical of heroes.

1396
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:33,170
Yeah.

1397
01:38:36,140 --> 01:38:37,940
We're already saying goodbye to this
island, huh.

1398
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:39,280
Whatever.

1399
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:56,480
It's really ok for you to leave without saying
goodbye to those brats?

1400
01:38:57,250 --> 01:38:59,030
There are some things I wanted
to tell them, but...

1401
01:39:00,220 --> 01:39:03,520
It's okay, I'm sure they will understand.

1402
01:39:04,950 --> 01:39:08,040
Hey! Hey!

1403
01:39:08,470 --> 01:39:10,330
Deku-niisan!

1404
01:39:10,410 --> 01:39:11,770
Bakugo!

1405
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:13,520
Everyone!

1406
01:39:14,410 --> 01:39:19,670
Thank you for protecting us all!

1407
01:39:21,180 --> 01:39:22,540
Deku-niisan!

1408
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:25,010
I will become strong!

1409
01:39:25,820 --> 01:39:28,660
At least enough to protect my
daddy and big sister!

1410
01:39:28,980 --> 01:39:30,090
I will become strong!

1411
01:39:33,050 --> 01:39:39,770
And then, I'll show you, how I will become a cool hero
like you and Bakugo!

1412
01:39:41,420 --> 01:39:44,440
Don't forget those words, shitty brat.

1413
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:47,060
Katsuma-kun!

1414
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:51,840
You... can become a hero!

1415
01:39:55,640 --> 01:39:57,800
I'll wait for you at U.A.!
