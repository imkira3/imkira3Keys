00:01:35,075 --> 00:01:39,341
<i>In the beginning, before Creation,
there was Darkness.</i>

3
00:01:45,552 --> 00:01:48,680
<i>From the primordial explosion emerged...</i>

4
00:01:49,223 --> 00:01:51,555
<i>the fire of Chaos.</i>

5
00:01:55,395 --> 00:01:57,886
<i>Chaos merged with Darkness...</i>

6
00:01:58,765 --> 00:02:02,292
and from this union
were born the elements:

7
00:02:02,836 --> 00:02:04,133
<i>Night...</i>

8
00:02:04,671 --> 00:02:05,865
<i>Day...</i>

9
00:02:06,306 --> 00:02:07,568
<i>Matter...</i>

10
00:02:07,941 --> 00:02:09,272
<i>and Air.</i>

11
00:02:30,264 --> 00:02:33,756
<i>Then, out of this misty radiance
of the Cosmos...</i>

12
00:02:34,101 --> 00:02:37,662
<i>there came forth a jar,
golden and glittering.</i>

13
00:02:38,171 --> 00:02:39,640
<i>Pandora's jar.</i>

14
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:44,011
<i>It was filled with all the essences,
both good and evil...</i>

15
00:02:44,111 --> 00:02:46,045
<i>of life itself.</i>

16
00:02:59,226 --> 00:03:01,558
<i>From the fragments of the jar...</i>

17
00:03:01,695 --> 00:03:05,358
<i>the planets
and the solar system were formed.</i>

18
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,983
<i>Saturn or Cronos...</i>

19
00:03:26,286 --> 00:03:28,811
<i>the world of mystic rings.</i>

20
00:03:44,404 --> 00:03:48,397
<i>Other fragments became
the flaming energies that gave shape to...</i>

21
00:03:48,575 --> 00:03:49,837
<i>Mercury.</i>

22
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:17,500
<i>Yet another fragment
gave birth to the colossus...</i>

23
00:04:17,871 --> 00:04:21,432
<i>Jupiter, the titan of the skies.</i>

24
00:04:32,119 --> 00:04:35,282
<i>And so the worlds of the universe
were created...</i>

25
00:04:35,756 --> 00:04:38,657
<i>along with the moons
that accompany them.</i>

26
00:04:40,327 --> 00:04:43,558
<i>And then, Earth.</i>

27
00:04:44,598 --> 00:04:48,090
<i>And on Earth, there was life everywhere.</i>

28
00:05:04,851 --> 00:05:08,588
<i>But the first beings that the mists
of creation offered forth...</i>

29
00:05:08,688 --> 00:05:10,212
<i>were not men.</i>

30
00:05:10,957 --> 00:05:14,791
<i>They were of the supreme essence,
and became gods.</i>

31
00:05:15,762 --> 00:05:18,322
<i>They claimed the moon as their home.</i>

32
00:05:18,932 --> 00:05:22,197
<i>There, to deliberate and to decide...</i>

33
00:05:22,369 --> 00:05:24,701
<i>the ultimate fate of mankind...</i>

34
00:05:25,172 --> 00:05:27,299
<i>and of all that lived.</i>

35
00:05:49,563 --> 00:05:51,588
Pandora's jar is broken...

36
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:56,468
and the forces of evil
have been let loose.

37
00:05:58,205 --> 00:06:01,732
The world of mortal men
is facing its hour of decision.

38
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,810
It will go down to destruction...

39
00:06:06,646 --> 00:06:08,978
or else, it will survive.

40
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:12,111
This is their moment of trial.

41
00:06:12,652 --> 00:06:17,112
They've got to show themselves worthy
of everything we gods have given them.

42
00:06:18,091 --> 00:06:20,559
But evil is dark and strong.

43
00:06:21,761 --> 00:06:24,398
And it may be that the scales of fate...

44
00:06:24,498 --> 00:06:26,066
are not yet in full balance.

45
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:29,567
What can I do to equalize
both sides of the struggle, Athena?

46
00:06:30,604 --> 00:06:33,974
If you don't want to increase
the powers of all men...

47
00:06:34,074 --> 00:06:36,975
then why don't you increase
those of one...

48
00:06:37,444 --> 00:06:40,208
so that he may fight for all the others?

49
00:06:40,614 --> 00:06:41,842
Now...

50
00:06:43,817 --> 00:06:47,487
a man who is stronger
and more intelligent...

51
00:06:47,587 --> 00:06:49,418
than all other men.

52
00:06:51,124 --> 00:06:52,455
A hero...

53
00:06:53,026 --> 00:06:56,621
with a body forged in the furnace
of 1,000 suns...

54
00:06:57,264 --> 00:07:01,530
a body capable of undergoing
every labor and every pain...

55
00:07:02,068 --> 00:07:03,937
practically invincible.

56
00:07:04,037 --> 00:07:08,201
Made from the purest
of all energies: Light.

57
00:07:45,712 --> 00:07:49,580
Descend to the earth now, Light.
As a living being.

58
00:07:50,317 --> 00:07:53,150
And incarnate your mighty energies...

59
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,016
in the body of a newborn man.

60
00:08:17,377 --> 00:08:20,175
<i>Thebes in the Bronze Age.</i>

61
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,444
<i>Four thousand years from this moment...</i>

62
00:08:24,117 --> 00:08:25,744
<i>the royal palace.</i>

63
00:08:45,972 --> 00:08:50,810
<i>Hercules, the newborn son
of Amphitryon, King of Thebes...</i>

64
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,174
<i>and of his queen, Alcmene.</i>

65
00:08:53,546 --> 00:08:56,310
<i>He will be Zeus' hero.</i>

66
00:09:05,258 --> 00:09:07,385
Even as the hero is born...

67
00:09:07,594 --> 00:09:11,121
the forces of evil
are at work in Thebes.

68
00:10:58,538 --> 00:11:00,403
Commander.

69
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,576
The sacred sword has been stolen
from the Temple of Hera.

70
00:11:03,676 --> 00:11:05,779
- The guards have been killed.
- Sacrilege.

71
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:08,848
I'll give the alarm at once,
and I'll order all the doors closed.

72
00:11:08,948 --> 00:11:10,483
Have you notified anyone else?

73
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,852
- You're the supreme commander, sir.
- Good.

74
00:11:12,952 --> 00:11:15,978
Thebes will repay you like this.

75
00:11:20,326 --> 00:11:23,659
What a shame you didn't see
that it was all planned.

76
00:11:24,764 --> 00:11:26,026
Princess!

77
00:11:32,105 --> 00:11:34,674
Now that my man has stolen the sword...

78
00:11:34,774 --> 00:11:36,843
we can go ahead with our plan.

79
00:11:36,943 --> 00:11:40,845
Let the soldiers think
it was the king who violated the temple.

80
00:11:41,047 --> 00:11:43,917
They will follow you,
and you will be ruler of Thebes...

81
00:11:44,017 --> 00:11:45,917
and of most of Greece.

82
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:49,652
Provided you kill
the king and the queen tonight...

83
00:11:50,456 --> 00:11:53,948
and their son, the newborn prince,
the little Hercules.

84
00:11:54,694 --> 00:11:58,687
For you and your father,
King Minos of Thira...

85
00:11:59,299 --> 00:12:01,563
the sword that stops the fire.

86
00:12:02,035 --> 00:12:03,525
And for me...

87
00:12:05,071 --> 00:12:07,631
the throne of Thebes.

88
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,986
<i>The evil rebels attacked
the loyal guards...</i>

89
00:12:20,086 --> 00:12:23,146
<i>and soon,
Thebes became a tragic battlefield.</i>

90
00:12:24,023 --> 00:12:28,517
<i>The loyalists were killed,
and the crown was overthrown.</i>

91
00:13:11,371 --> 00:13:14,240
There, Valcheus. Now Thebes is yours.

92
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,739
Excellent.

93
00:13:16,175 --> 00:13:17,210
The son?

94
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:21,269
I've left that sublime pleasure for you.

95
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:38,058
Farewell, little king.

96
00:13:38,798 --> 00:13:41,323
You'll never wear a crown.

97
00:13:45,271 --> 00:13:46,940
- Sostratos.
- Yes?

98
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,302
The baby!

99
00:13:49,842 --> 00:13:52,743
Where is the king's son?
Where's Hercules?

100
00:13:52,845 --> 00:13:54,710
- I don't know. I thought...
- Valcheus.

101
00:13:54,948 --> 00:13:57,542
One of the maids fled with the child.

102
00:13:57,784 --> 00:14:00,987
Someone saw her heading
for the secret passageway.

103
00:14:01,087 --> 00:14:03,647
Get her. Capture her!

104
00:14:54,107 --> 00:14:55,904
- Mama.
- Kill him!

105
00:15:05,718 --> 00:15:07,208
Don't bother.

106
00:15:12,658 --> 00:15:16,287
It's no use. The river will get rid
of the child for us.

107
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,164
Back to Thebes, our job is done.

108
00:15:40,887 --> 00:15:44,448
<i>So the newborn baby,
poor little Prince Hercules...</i>

109
00:15:45,158 --> 00:15:49,925
<i>sailed on and on along the river,
mile after mile...</i>

110
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,227
<i>adrift and alone.</i>

111
00:16:48,187 --> 00:16:50,314
Put that back in the river.

112
00:16:53,893 --> 00:16:55,155
All right.

113
00:17:14,714 --> 00:17:18,551
But Zeus, you put it past the rapids,
where it's safe.

114
00:17:18,651 --> 00:17:22,451
You didn't say where to put it.
You just said, "in the river."

115
00:17:33,633 --> 00:17:37,865
Zeus is clever.
He intervenes for his divine son.

116
00:17:38,738 --> 00:17:41,434
But it's up to me to right the balance.

117
00:18:50,276 --> 00:18:51,675
Poor thing.

118
00:18:52,144 --> 00:18:55,515
- Abandoned on the bank of a river.
- Where do you suppose he comes from?

119
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,983
There are no cities nearby.

120
00:18:57,083 --> 00:19:01,486
Perhaps the gods heard my prayers
and sent us the baby we couldn't have.

121
00:19:01,821 --> 00:19:04,756
Dear, he'll be like our own son.

122
00:19:09,161 --> 00:19:13,393
<i>In the cosmic chess game between
the gods, this was yet another move...</i>

123
00:19:13,499 --> 00:19:16,991
<i>toward the final encounter
between good and evil.</i>

124
00:19:22,608 --> 00:19:25,873
And now, among men,
where time hurries on...

125
00:19:26,612 --> 00:19:29,638
your hero is growing,
and his strength is increasing.

126
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:32,748
The strength that you gave him, Zeus.

127
00:20:56,369 --> 00:21:00,499
- Your hands possess the power of Zeus.
- I know, Father.

128
00:21:01,273 --> 00:21:03,104
But I don't know why.

129
00:21:03,376 --> 00:21:05,810
There must be some purpose for it.

130
00:21:06,545 --> 00:21:08,410
When the time comes...

131
00:21:08,848 --> 00:21:10,916
the gods will tell you what it's for.

132
00:21:11,016 --> 00:21:13,552
Let's finish chopping the trees
and carry the wood home.

133
00:21:13,652 --> 00:21:14,854
It must be near lunchtime.

134
00:21:14,954 --> 00:21:17,023
I can finish this forest
before you get home.

135
00:21:17,123 --> 00:21:18,750
All right, hurry up.

136
00:21:38,377 --> 00:21:39,639
Hercules?

137
00:21:46,051 --> 00:21:47,450
Is that you?

138
00:22:32,932 --> 00:22:34,160
Father!

139
00:22:35,074 --> 00:22:36,673
Father!

140
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:55,373
That's how all your heroes
end up: as stars.

141
00:23:57,283 --> 00:24:01,821
I wonder, how many constellations
will there be before you can stop Hercules?

142
00:24:01,921 --> 00:24:04,223
Don't let that worry you, my dear.

143
00:24:04,323 --> 00:24:07,793
I've plenty of followers
already preparing themselves...

144
00:24:07,893 --> 00:24:10,123
to attack the champion of men.

145
00:24:12,097 --> 00:24:13,530
Daedalus!

146
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:19,371
Embodiment of knowledge,
reason, and curiosity...

147
00:24:19,471 --> 00:24:23,202
the great genius of invention,
master of science.

148
00:24:23,776 --> 00:24:25,869
I, King Minos of Thira...

149
00:24:26,545 --> 00:24:28,137
call on you...

150
00:24:29,348 --> 00:24:33,478
to step into time and space.
Materialize out of Chaos.

151
00:24:58,777 --> 00:25:00,438
I need your help.

152
00:25:01,213 --> 00:25:04,341
Minos, when you ask me
to help, it means...

153
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,843
you want to serve the gods.

154
00:25:07,052 --> 00:25:09,247
What does Hera want this time?

155
00:25:10,489 --> 00:25:12,753
We have to eliminate Hercules.

156
00:25:13,726 --> 00:25:19,390
One day, Minos, you will have to choose
between the gods and science.

157
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:21,363
Daedalus

158
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:25,866
You know me. I am dedicated to science.

159
00:25:26,138 --> 00:25:28,368
I do not believe in the gods.

160
00:25:29,241 --> 00:25:32,269
But doing them a little favor
can't hurt, can it?

161
00:25:37,116 --> 00:25:39,448
Anyway, the problem is Hercules.

162
00:25:40,419 --> 00:25:42,621
This favorite of the gods
must be stopped.

163
00:25:42,721 --> 00:25:45,155
And this is my solution to Hercules.

164
00:25:50,162 --> 00:25:52,790
A small solution to such a big problem.

165
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:58,729
My dear, size, like time and space,
is relative.

166
00:25:59,672 --> 00:26:02,641
Relative also
to atmospheric conditions, right?

167
00:26:02,741 --> 00:26:06,268
And on hitting the earth's atmosphere,
it will grow...

168
00:26:06,545 --> 00:26:08,945
big, huge, immense...

169
00:26:10,649 --> 00:26:12,014
terrifying.

170
00:26:13,085 --> 00:26:16,054
He is programmed to destroy Hercules.

171
00:26:16,722 --> 00:26:18,883
And whoever gets in his way.

172
00:26:21,393 --> 00:26:22,724
Naturally.

173
00:26:23,996 --> 00:26:26,396
Go, my little metallic friend...

174
00:26:27,633 --> 00:26:29,430
fulfill your destiny.

175
00:26:30,035 --> 00:26:33,300
Turn into the colossal exterminator
you really are.

176
00:26:33,405 --> 00:26:36,067
Go, kill, my deadly toy.

177
00:26:51,757 --> 00:26:53,281
Hercules!

178
00:27:31,964 --> 00:27:35,422
- Your mother is in danger! Come!
- What?

179
00:27:46,779 --> 00:27:48,007
Mother!

180
00:28:07,266 --> 00:28:09,131
Tell me what happened, please.

181
00:29:58,543 --> 00:30:00,204
Farewell, Mother.

182
00:30:33,812 --> 00:30:35,677
What are you doing?

183
00:30:36,882 --> 00:30:38,483
It's your own house.

184
00:30:38,583 --> 00:30:42,041
I don't have a house anymore,
or a family.

185
00:30:43,488 --> 00:30:47,083
I'll have no peace
until I find the reason for all this.

186
00:30:47,526 --> 00:30:49,960
Why am I stronger than other men?

187
00:30:50,562 --> 00:30:53,963
Why does my strength
bring so many sorrows on my head?

188
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:59,197
Where will you go?

189
00:31:02,007 --> 00:31:03,941
To Tyre, to seek my fortune.

190
00:31:04,409 --> 00:31:06,809
The King there is holding games...

191
00:31:07,112 --> 00:31:10,309
to find the best warrior
for an important mission.

192
00:32:03,068 --> 00:32:07,039
That man is different from the others.
He has incredible strength.

193
00:32:07,139 --> 00:32:08,173
Who is he?

194
00:32:08,273 --> 00:32:12,039
I don't know, he just came
and passed through all the tests.

195
00:32:12,411 --> 00:32:14,038
Quite a surprise.

196
00:32:29,261 --> 00:32:32,958
There's still the chariots,
Your Majesty.

197
00:32:34,766 --> 00:32:38,099
That's a very hard test, Dorcon.
Maybe too hard...

198
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:39,832
isn't it?

199
00:32:40,572 --> 00:32:44,770
But you've got to be absolutely sure,
Your Majesty.

200
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,605
Very well. Let them begin!

201
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:52,971
He seems to be the final winner.

202
00:34:53,071 --> 00:34:55,266
We'll soon see, Your Majesty.

203
00:34:55,574 --> 00:34:59,066
With your permission,
there are still the wrestlers.

204
00:36:35,106 --> 00:36:36,474
You have won, valiant youth.

205
00:36:36,574 --> 00:36:39,678
You are the victor of these games.
I'll put your might to good use.

206
00:36:39,778 --> 00:36:40,802
How?

207
00:36:41,012 --> 00:36:44,379
You'll accompany
my daughter Cassiopea to Athens.

208
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,815
This is no easy task.

209
00:36:48,219 --> 00:36:51,814
Hellas is menaced by evil and mischief,
as you well know.

210
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:55,626
They say these demons come from Thira,
the black island...

211
00:36:56,127 --> 00:36:58,630
and are the creatures
of the evil king Minos...

212
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:01,255
and his wicked daughter, Adriana.

213
00:37:02,867 --> 00:37:05,768
I will take your daughter
to Athens, sire.

214
00:37:07,906 --> 00:37:11,171
One moment, Your Majesty.
We must be careful.

215
00:37:11,676 --> 00:37:14,042
- Very careful.
- How do you mean?

216
00:37:15,146 --> 00:37:17,740
This man is a true champion, yes...

217
00:37:18,616 --> 00:37:23,212
but how can we be sure he isn't part of
the evil and mischief you mentioned?

218
00:37:24,923 --> 00:37:29,019
- We can't.
- Permit me, Your Majesty. We can.

219
00:37:30,128 --> 00:37:33,859
We can put him to the test
in a sacred place...

220
00:37:34,165 --> 00:37:36,190
where no evil can enter.

221
00:37:36,468 --> 00:37:39,130
The sacred stables of Cybele...

222
00:37:39,604 --> 00:37:42,368
where the goddess'
1,000 horses are kept.

223
00:37:44,409 --> 00:37:47,071
- And the test?
- A simple one:

224
00:37:48,847 --> 00:37:51,782
To clean the stables
by tomorrow morning.

225
00:37:52,784 --> 00:37:54,786
Father, that's impossible.

226
00:37:54,886 --> 00:37:57,188
Those stables
haven't been cleaned in years.

227
00:37:57,288 --> 00:37:58,983
It's an impossible task.

228
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:02,257
Do you feel equal
to this test, Hercules?

229
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,393
Come at dawn, sire, and you will see.

230
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:31,054
So you've already given up,
I see, Hercules.

231
00:38:31,356 --> 00:38:34,125
The moon is almost down,
and there you sit.

232
00:38:34,225 --> 00:38:37,319
- It looks like Dorcon was right.
- You think so?

233
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:39,654
No.

234
00:38:39,898 --> 00:38:43,735
But I knew no one could
possibly pass this test. Not even you.

235
00:38:43,835 --> 00:38:47,072
It is an impossible task.
That's why Dorcon suggested it.

236
00:38:47,172 --> 00:38:48,639
He's jealous.

237
00:38:49,874 --> 00:38:52,308
Why do you wear a veil, Cassiopea?

238
00:38:52,677 --> 00:38:55,168
I'm promised to Diomene of Athens.

239
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:59,284
But the oracle said I would marry
whoever first saw my face...

240
00:38:59,384 --> 00:39:01,953
after my eighteenth summer was past.

241
00:39:02,053 --> 00:39:04,681
So since then, I have worn this veil.

242
00:39:06,224 --> 00:39:08,556
It's a shame no one can see you.

243
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:12,496
- I've heard you're beautiful.
- Tend to your own affairs.

244
00:39:13,164 --> 00:39:15,367
Such as how
you're going to explain your failure.

245
00:39:15,467 --> 00:39:16,957
Not so fast.

246
00:39:18,002 --> 00:39:21,563
I'm taking things easy
because I know what I'm going to do.

247
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,934
Really?

248
00:39:25,276 --> 00:39:28,302
If you doubt it, then let's make a pact.

249
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,245
If I should succeed...

250
00:39:31,649 --> 00:39:33,674
you will remove your veil.

251
00:39:33,785 --> 00:39:35,685
No, I can't do that.

252
00:39:35,954 --> 00:39:38,946
You said yourself,
no one can pass the test.

253
00:39:41,759 --> 00:39:43,226
Do you accept?

254
00:39:50,902 --> 00:39:52,504
All right, then.

255
00:39:52,604 --> 00:39:56,904
I'll remove my veil, but only for you,
if you succeed.

256
00:39:57,675 --> 00:40:02,046
But if you fail, Hercules,
then I'll have you run out of Tyre.

257
00:40:02,146 --> 00:40:04,315
Now I've got a reason to hurry.

258
00:40:04,415 --> 00:40:06,484
Let's go to the river. Come on.

259
00:40:06,584 --> 00:40:08,518
The river? What for?

260
00:40:08,853 --> 00:40:13,517
I was told to clean the stable, but not how.
Come down to the river. Come on.

261
00:40:48,793 --> 00:40:52,251
- I don't understand.
- There. You see the river?

262
00:40:52,497 --> 00:40:54,328
It will do the job for me.

263
00:43:17,008 --> 00:43:19,033
I've done what I promised.

264
00:43:19,677 --> 00:43:21,440
Now it's your turn.

265
00:44:25,843 --> 00:44:28,573
Your Highness, here.

266
00:44:35,686 --> 00:44:38,553
There. It's just as Hera said.

267
00:44:40,892 --> 00:44:43,122
Carry the princess to my boat.

268
00:45:01,078 --> 00:45:03,444
We'll keep him that way until...

269
00:45:03,915 --> 00:45:05,815
we're well out to sea.

270
00:45:06,751 --> 00:45:09,219
Then we'll feed him to the sharks.

271
00:45:22,733 --> 00:45:26,863
<i>Poor Hercules.
Destined to die just for being in love.</i>

272
00:45:27,171 --> 00:45:30,038
<i>He's not dead. I only stunned him.</i>

273
00:45:31,509 --> 00:45:34,342
Cassiopea was promised
to the son of Hera.

274
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:38,908
If I hadn't struck Hercules
with my lightning...

275
00:45:40,017 --> 00:45:43,714
- she would have done worse.
- But is it wrong to be in love?

276
00:45:43,921 --> 00:45:45,548
To have a heart?

277
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:50,426
- If he isn't dead, he will be soon.
- Don't underestimate him.

278
00:45:51,629 --> 00:45:54,257
He knows how to take care of himself.

279
00:46:39,844 --> 00:46:42,904
<i>For seven days
and seven nights he swam...</i>

280
00:46:43,347 --> 00:46:45,247
<i>this champion of men.</i>

281
00:46:46,284 --> 00:46:48,616
<i>He swam through becalmed waters...</i>

282
00:46:48,819 --> 00:46:51,617
<i>and he swam through titanic storms.</i>

283
00:47:41,105 --> 00:47:44,302
- You're hurting me. Let me go!
- Who are you?

284
00:47:44,775 --> 00:47:49,405
Who are you? This is my island,
and you are the intruder.

285
00:47:56,187 --> 00:47:58,951
- My name is Hercules.
- I know.

286
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:02,789
- I know everything.
- Why did you ask then?

287
00:48:03,094 --> 00:48:05,028
To test your sincerity.

288
00:48:05,896 --> 00:48:07,022
Come.

289
00:48:11,268 --> 00:48:12,462
Where?

290
00:48:12,803 --> 00:48:17,399
Into my mansion,
where I'll give you rest and food.

291
00:48:17,875 --> 00:48:22,141
Just as the fairy goddess Athena
instructed me to.

292
00:48:37,495 --> 00:48:40,623
You've really got a strong appetite,
young man.

293
00:48:42,066 --> 00:48:43,795
There, some wine.

294
00:48:50,908 --> 00:48:52,671
I need help, witch.

295
00:48:54,078 --> 00:48:57,275
- Will you help me?
- I would if I could.

296
00:48:57,882 --> 00:48:59,941
Your enemies are my enemies.

297
00:49:00,618 --> 00:49:04,588
King Minos and his evil daughter
Adriana left me here...

298
00:49:04,688 --> 00:49:08,259
and stole from me the one thing
I could have used to help you.

299
00:49:08,359 --> 00:49:09,393
What?

300
00:49:09,493 --> 00:49:11,927
The charm that Athena gave me.

301
00:49:12,129 --> 00:49:13,960
It is our only hope.

302
00:49:14,298 --> 00:49:18,234
It is the only way we have
of leaving this island.

303
00:49:19,136 --> 00:49:21,536
So we're lost? Trapped here?

304
00:49:22,473 --> 00:49:24,202
I can't believe it.

305
00:49:24,542 --> 00:49:28,612
There is another way, but no.
It's too risky.

306
00:49:28,712 --> 00:49:32,648
- How? Tell me!
- Calm down.

307
00:49:33,484 --> 00:49:35,452
There is a way...

308
00:49:37,054 --> 00:49:40,257
but, first of all...

309
00:49:40,357 --> 00:49:42,450
What are you doing?

310
00:49:43,527 --> 00:49:47,264
I need 10 drops
of your powerful blood...

311
00:49:47,364 --> 00:49:50,001
in exchange
for what I have to tell you...

312
00:49:50,101 --> 00:49:52,899
if you want to see
your sweetheart again.

313
00:51:10,714 --> 00:51:12,147
Who are you?

314
00:51:12,683 --> 00:51:15,777
I'm Circe, the sorceress.

315
00:51:43,681 --> 00:51:45,850
There it is, over there...

316
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:49,386
with its 90 cities
and Atlantis, its capital.

317
00:51:50,588 --> 00:51:52,783
And now, all is arranged.

318
00:51:54,024 --> 00:51:58,791
When the seventh moon rises,
we shall sacrifice to the Goddess Hera...

319
00:51:59,897 --> 00:52:01,990
who stands by our side.

320
00:52:05,102 --> 00:52:08,629
And that sacrifice will be you.

321
00:52:14,411 --> 00:52:18,649
This is a Garden of Eden.
Why would a sorceress like you live here?

322
00:52:18,749 --> 00:52:20,317
I told you...

323
00:52:20,417 --> 00:52:24,854
I tried to defy the wickedness and evil
of King Minos with my magic.

324
00:52:25,723 --> 00:52:29,489
But his evil power is so overwhelming
that he defeated me.

325
00:52:30,527 --> 00:52:33,898
And so I was exiled from Thira
and placed here.

326
00:52:33,998 --> 00:52:37,900
And then I came to rescue you
because Athena urged me to do it.

327
00:52:38,135 --> 00:52:42,572
To help you work out your destiny,
and to advise you what to do.

328
00:52:42,773 --> 00:52:44,108
Then tell me.

329
00:52:44,208 --> 00:52:47,745
We need the charm
to carry us wherever we want to go...

330
00:52:47,845 --> 00:52:50,746
- even to Thira.
- But you said they stole it.

331
00:52:51,682 --> 00:52:55,982
Yes, and they threw it
where no one can possibly get it...

332
00:52:56,987 --> 00:52:58,978
except someone like you.

333
00:52:59,957 --> 00:53:03,327
But you will have to overcome
the most terrible obstacles.

334
00:53:03,427 --> 00:53:04,792
Take those.

335
00:53:10,067 --> 00:53:12,369
That shield and that sword...

336
00:53:12,469 --> 00:53:15,700
will protect you from the dangers
that lie ahead.

337
00:53:21,145 --> 00:53:25,149
Circe has tricked Hercules into helping her
retrieve her talisman.

338
00:53:25,249 --> 00:53:27,274
He's just liable to do it.

339
00:53:29,053 --> 00:53:32,556
If he does,
Circe will be coming back to Thira...

340
00:53:32,656 --> 00:53:34,491
and this time with Hercules.

341
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:37,328
You know what a mess she made
the last time, all by herself.

342
00:53:37,428 --> 00:53:41,592
<i>I've got to stop....
We have to stop them, Daedalus.</i>

343
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:45,295
My little creation should do the trick.

344
00:53:45,469 --> 00:53:50,304
My three-headed metal monster will
consume Circe and Hercules in its flames.

345
00:53:50,974 --> 00:53:54,578
- Another mechanical monster?
- And why not, Minos?

346
00:53:54,678 --> 00:53:57,581
The last one didn't work
so well, you know.

347
00:53:57,681 --> 00:54:00,514
It spits cosmic rays of deadly fire.

348
00:54:01,085 --> 00:54:04,248
- Do you know what that means?
- Cosmic rays?

349
00:54:05,956 --> 00:54:07,617
That means that...

350
00:54:07,925 --> 00:54:11,622
Hercules and Circe
will disintegrate, nothing left.

351
00:54:19,169 --> 00:54:21,797
Could I just see it grow a little bit?

352
00:54:23,941 --> 00:54:27,342
It would mean a great deal to me.
Please?

353
00:55:34,778 --> 00:55:39,340
The Hydra. The three-headed dragon
that guards the gates of Hell.

354
00:56:49,353 --> 00:56:52,322
The shield!
Reflect the rays back at him!

355
00:57:03,901 --> 00:57:06,995
Destroy it with its own rays.
Lift the shield!

356
00:57:36,967 --> 00:57:41,165
There, the endless stairway will lead us
to the center of the earth.

357
00:57:43,507 --> 00:57:46,670
Follow me, if you ever
want to reach Thira.

358
00:57:47,544 --> 00:57:51,878
<i>On the green isle of Thira,
in its capital, Atlantis...</i>

359
00:57:52,749 --> 00:57:57,379
<i>Cassiopea awaits hopelessly
the night of her sacrifice.</i>

360
00:58:03,293 --> 00:58:06,864
<i>Meanwhile,
Hercules and the sorceress Circe...</i>

361
00:58:06,964 --> 00:58:11,094
<i>cross the rainbow that will lead them
to the gates of Hell.</i>

362
00:58:49,139 --> 00:58:52,267
Well? Where do we go from here?

363
00:58:52,976 --> 00:58:55,279
There, inside the Skull Mountain.

364
00:58:55,379 --> 00:58:57,681
Yes, it's the Temple of Eternity.

365
00:58:57,781 --> 00:59:01,018
It is the center of Hell.
That's where my charm is.

366
00:59:01,118 --> 00:59:03,985
Hercules, you must get it back for me.

367
00:59:04,588 --> 00:59:06,988
- How can we get there?
- Trust me.

368
00:59:12,229 --> 00:59:15,632
That's Charon,
the boatman of the River Styx.

369
00:59:15,732 --> 00:59:17,666
He'll take us across.

370
01:00:43,353 --> 01:00:47,483
There, Hercules,
under the Hand of Destiny...

371
01:00:47,991 --> 01:00:50,394
is the soul of the world.

372
01:00:50,494 --> 01:00:54,328
It is the primal seed
of everything that exists.

373
01:00:55,732 --> 01:00:59,224
Inside it is my charm.

374
01:01:08,545 --> 01:01:11,105
Don't be taken in by appearances.

375
01:01:12,149 --> 01:01:15,209
It looks simple,
but only you can get it...

376
01:01:15,585 --> 01:01:17,644
if you can pass the test.

377
01:01:18,755 --> 01:01:20,090
What test?

378
01:01:20,190 --> 01:01:24,593
The soul is inaccessible,
protected by a barrier.

379
01:01:25,095 --> 01:01:29,589
A triple barrier of magic,
such as that around Thira...

380
01:01:30,167 --> 01:01:33,398
and which keeps everything away
from the soul.

381
01:01:34,604 --> 01:01:37,232
Stretch your hand out and you'll see.

382
01:01:48,285 --> 01:01:51,049
- How?
- Try it again, Hercules.

383
01:01:51,822 --> 01:01:54,552
But be prepared for a terrible test.

384
01:02:02,098 --> 01:02:04,066
Hold strong, Hercules.

385
01:02:11,374 --> 01:02:13,910
Now the cold is coming.

386
01:02:14,010 --> 01:02:17,502
After the Heat of the Soul,
the Supreme Freeze...

387
01:02:17,814 --> 01:02:19,782
the final barrier.

388
01:02:21,818 --> 01:02:24,412
Resist. Only you can do it.

389
01:02:24,654 --> 01:02:27,248
You can make the barrier disappear.

390
01:02:33,663 --> 01:02:37,258
The talisman. Get it now.
Take it quickly.

391
01:02:43,607 --> 01:02:45,006
I've got it.

392
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:50,707
The talisman.
Now I can get to the Island of Thira.

393
01:02:51,882 --> 01:02:53,984
- Just a moment.
- Give it to me.

394
01:02:54,084 --> 01:02:58,355
I kept my side of the bargain,
now you must show me you have not lied.

395
01:02:58,455 --> 01:03:01,291
Are you ready to take me
to Cassiopea now?

396
01:03:01,391 --> 01:03:05,054
I can't take you to Thira,
not even with the talisman.

397
01:03:05,295 --> 01:03:08,632
The magic of King Minos and Adriana
cancels mine out.

398
01:03:08,732 --> 01:03:10,996
- A curse on you!
- Stop, please.

399
01:03:12,035 --> 01:03:13,434
I beg you.

400
01:03:13,703 --> 01:03:17,503
Give it to me, Hercules.
Otherwise it will be lost forever.

401
01:03:22,545 --> 01:03:23,842
Please.

402
01:03:27,817 --> 01:03:30,377
Can you at least take me near Thira?

403
01:03:33,156 --> 01:03:36,887
That I can do. Pass me that talisman.

404
01:03:48,939 --> 01:03:50,574
Creator of the light...

405
01:03:50,674 --> 01:03:53,276
possessor of the keys
and of the burning breath...

406
01:03:53,376 --> 01:03:55,378
and of the glowing soul, hear me.

407
01:03:55,478 --> 01:03:58,348
God of the Empire,
conductor of the planets...

408
01:03:58,448 --> 01:04:02,350
highest of all the gods,
God of the sky and of the earth.

409
01:04:07,657 --> 01:04:10,990
Take me as close as possible to Thira!

410
01:04:11,695 --> 01:04:12,753
Now.

411
01:04:20,403 --> 01:04:22,405
Another one of your tricks, witch.

412
01:04:22,505 --> 01:04:26,676
This does not look like the Island of Thira.
This does not look like the place.

413
01:04:26,776 --> 01:04:29,846
Yes. But here you shall have
the most precious gift of all...

414
01:04:29,946 --> 01:04:34,150
- Prometheus' winged chariot.
- But the winged horses are lost in infinity.

415
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:37,387
With your strength you'll find a way
of making them fly again...

416
01:04:37,487 --> 01:04:40,581
but first, you must win it
from Xenodama...

417
01:04:40,824 --> 01:04:42,553
the King of Africa.

418
01:04:54,671 --> 01:04:58,107
I hope I haven't come all this way
for nothing, Circe.

419
01:04:58,641 --> 01:05:01,978
Some years ago,
you promised me Prometheus' chariot...

420
01:05:02,078 --> 01:05:05,115
if I could open a channel
in this dry strip of land.

421
01:05:05,215 --> 01:05:09,049
You may have it, if you grant my wish.
But how will you do it?

422
01:05:09,452 --> 01:05:11,113
Just wait and see.

423
01:05:19,029 --> 01:05:21,293
My strength alone can't do it.

424
01:05:21,831 --> 01:05:24,595
Is there anything you can do to help me?

425
01:05:35,712 --> 01:05:38,815
O Goddess who created the chant
that all honor...

426
01:05:38,915 --> 01:05:43,409
you who are the indescribable, secret,
echoing, resplendent bud...

427
01:05:43,753 --> 01:05:47,712
you who with one look can make
the mist and darkness disappear.

428
01:05:48,124 --> 01:05:52,262
You, O Goddess, who can move the cosmos
with the beating of your wings.

429
01:05:52,362 --> 01:05:56,298
Give now to Hercules
the size and height he calls for.

430
01:05:59,736 --> 01:06:01,328
Grow, Hercules.

431
01:07:16,112 --> 01:07:18,548
<i>Thus, with the help of the gods...</i>

432
01:07:18,648 --> 01:07:22,607
<i>Hercules and the sorceress
created the great continents...</i>

433
01:07:22,919 --> 01:07:26,047
<i>by separating Europe from Africa.</i>

434
01:07:26,589 --> 01:07:29,793
You've given too much to your champion
and to the sorceress, Zeus.

435
01:07:29,893 --> 01:07:32,962
They've had to work hard
for everything they have won.

436
01:07:33,062 --> 01:07:36,433
But they have used magic,
magic that belongs to us.

437
01:07:36,533 --> 01:07:38,091
Enough, Hera.

438
01:07:38,601 --> 01:07:43,368
The opposing sides are even.
The victor will win by his own strength.

439
01:07:44,207 --> 01:07:48,044
And I think a time of trouble has come
for Hercules and Circe.

440
01:07:48,144 --> 01:07:51,781
Because, for the sake of balance,
I'm going to give Circe a little gift.

441
01:07:51,881 --> 01:07:55,214
A gift from Aphrodite,
the goddess of love.

442
01:07:56,819 --> 01:08:00,755
But you know very well
that the sorceress mustn't fall in love.

443
01:08:02,725 --> 01:08:05,285
Let's let them decide for themselves.

444
01:09:04,187 --> 01:09:05,855
There's the chariot.

445
01:09:05,955 --> 01:09:08,958
But we need something
to replace the magic horses.

446
01:09:09,058 --> 01:09:11,083
Can you think of anything?

447
01:10:17,694 --> 01:10:20,857
I need a rope
tied around this stone, sorceress.

448
01:10:43,553 --> 01:10:47,683
Now, tie the other end of the rope
to the chariot.

449
01:11:09,011 --> 01:11:12,081
Thank you, sorceress.
You've been a great help to me.

450
01:11:12,181 --> 01:11:15,708
- Now our roads must part.
- I'm coming to Thira with you.

451
01:11:16,419 --> 01:11:20,253
How is that? You can't be concerned
about Cassiopea's safety.

452
01:11:20,456 --> 01:11:22,321
You're right, I'm not.

453
01:11:22,725 --> 01:11:25,421
But I am concerned for yours, Hercules.

454
01:11:29,932 --> 01:11:34,301
- Are you absolutely sure you want to come?
- You'll find me very useful.

455
01:11:35,104 --> 01:11:39,200
Even your great strength won't mean much
against Minos and Adriana.

456
01:11:44,046 --> 01:11:46,776
All right. Get on.

457
01:13:27,049 --> 01:13:30,086
Why did the rope break?
What happened to your powers?

458
01:13:30,186 --> 01:13:31,954
You made me fall in love...

459
01:13:32,054 --> 01:13:35,956
and when that happens to a sorceress,
she loses all her powers.

460
01:13:36,158 --> 01:13:38,217
It's the law of Aphrodite.

461
01:13:38,594 --> 01:13:42,428
I, the enchantress, have been enchanted.

462
01:13:43,032 --> 01:13:45,694
Never mind, we're here. Look.

463
01:15:00,509 --> 01:15:02,534
Dress the little princess.

464
01:15:09,719 --> 01:15:13,322
Dear Cassiopea,
purified by the seventh moon...

465
01:15:13,422 --> 01:15:16,949
sweet and submissive,
thanks to the Black Lotus...

466
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:20,659
in this, the night set
for your sacrifice.

467
01:15:24,033 --> 01:15:27,525
<i>Hercules and Circe
finally reached their destination...</i>

468
01:15:28,237 --> 01:15:30,432
<i>the green isle of Thira.</i>

469
01:15:32,842 --> 01:15:35,072
This is as far as I go.

470
01:15:35,244 --> 01:15:39,476
That cave will take you directly
to the center of King Minos' palace...

471
01:15:39,582 --> 01:15:41,384
through his underground labyrinth.

472
01:15:41,484 --> 01:15:45,021
There you'll find your Cassiopea,
but you must hurry.

473
01:15:45,121 --> 01:15:49,225
The seventh moon is high in the sky
and the sacrifice is about to be made.

474
01:15:49,325 --> 01:15:53,125
Now everything depends
on your incredible strength, Hercules.

475
01:15:54,296 --> 01:15:56,059
Come with me, Circe.

476
01:15:56,298 --> 01:15:59,028
This is your destiny. You must go alone.

477
01:16:00,703 --> 01:16:02,136
Hercules!

478
01:16:53,289 --> 01:16:54,483
Circe.

479
01:16:58,260 --> 01:17:00,592
You must think of Cassiopea now.

480
01:17:00,863 --> 01:17:03,798
She is the woman chosen for you
by the gods.

481
01:17:04,467 --> 01:17:08,563
You must win for her,
and to give a future to your world.

482
01:17:10,906 --> 01:17:13,374
And for me, too.

483
01:17:33,028 --> 01:17:34,393
Minos!

484
01:17:54,917 --> 01:17:58,148
Hercules has entered
my labyrinth in Thira.

485
01:17:59,021 --> 01:18:02,650
He's in a trap.
There's no sorceress to help him this time.

486
01:18:03,025 --> 01:18:05,152
And I have plans for him.

487
01:18:06,562 --> 01:18:08,962
Daedalus, we've done it this time.

488
01:18:09,632 --> 01:18:11,429
You've earned a rest.

489
01:18:12,168 --> 01:18:15,934
You can go back to Chaos,
beyond time and space.

490
01:18:16,839 --> 01:18:20,036
I can handle it from here on in.
And Daedalus...

491
01:18:20,376 --> 01:18:24,513
I promise you, the next time I call on you
will be for the final showdown.

492
01:18:24,613 --> 01:18:26,882
Not science in the service
of the gods...

493
01:18:26,982 --> 01:18:29,712
but science to eliminate the gods.

494
01:18:31,554 --> 01:18:33,681
Only then will I return.

495
01:18:34,990 --> 01:18:38,892
Science for the sake of science.

496
01:20:16,325 --> 01:20:20,193
<i>Hercules has fallen deep
into the dungeons of Atlantis.</i>

497
01:20:21,630 --> 01:20:25,862
<i>Cassiopea is being taken
to meet her tragic end.</i>

498
01:20:27,202 --> 01:20:30,660
<i>King Minos' treacherous plan
is about to be fulfilled.</i>

499
01:20:31,273 --> 01:20:33,935
<i>Will evil triumph over good?</i>

500
01:20:35,344 --> 01:20:38,040
<i>The gods are powerless this night...</i>

501
01:20:38,681 --> 01:20:41,013
<i>in the land of Thira.</i>

502
01:21:08,377 --> 01:21:11,369
Cassiopea is ready
for the sacrifice, Father.

503
01:21:12,548 --> 01:21:15,847
The great play is drawing to an end.
Hera has won.

504
01:21:17,086 --> 01:21:19,919
It couldn't have gone
differently, anyway.

505
01:21:20,489 --> 01:21:22,524
Poor Circe, she never did understand...

506
01:21:22,624 --> 01:21:25,525
that her witchcraft was messy,
caused chaos.

507
01:21:25,928 --> 01:21:30,365
The pure magic of perfect knowledge,
science, is impeccable.

508
01:21:31,367 --> 01:21:34,666
The absolute dictator
of the universal forces.

509
01:21:36,205 --> 01:21:39,333
If I told her once,
I told her a thousand times:

510
01:21:39,475 --> 01:21:42,244
creation came out of chaos,
is surrounded by chaos...

511
01:21:42,344 --> 01:21:44,335
and will end in chaos.

512
01:21:44,847 --> 01:21:47,975
But while we're here,
we must have perfect order.

513
01:21:50,452 --> 01:21:52,317
Here in Thira...

514
01:21:53,322 --> 01:21:56,621
we have eliminated all emotion...

515
01:21:57,159 --> 01:21:59,525
all hope, all doubt.

516
01:22:00,662 --> 01:22:02,721
There is no uncertainty.

517
01:22:06,635 --> 01:22:09,433
Where was I? Hercules.

518
01:22:10,506 --> 01:22:14,499
Now that Hercules is in our power,
we must make good use of him.

519
01:22:15,477 --> 01:22:18,002
Use your charms on him. He's yours.

520
01:22:18,814 --> 01:22:22,011
If he resists, use the Black Lotus.
It's quicker.

521
01:22:22,484 --> 01:22:25,788
From your union will be born a race
of supreme champions...

522
01:22:25,888 --> 01:22:28,015
that will govern the earth.

523
01:22:28,724 --> 01:22:31,921
Have no fear. I will convince him.

524
01:22:32,895 --> 01:22:34,954
I have no doubt, my dear.

525
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:45,102
And now it is your turn,
my lovely virgin.

526
01:22:48,310 --> 01:22:52,644
Your groom
is eager to inflame your passions.

527
01:24:03,018 --> 01:24:05,350
Minos means to give you to me...

528
01:24:07,422 --> 01:24:09,913
and he couldn't have chosen better.

529
01:24:19,268 --> 01:24:21,031
The Black Lotus.

530
01:24:22,304 --> 01:24:24,636
Its nectar numbs the mind...

531
01:24:25,407 --> 01:24:27,671
and awakens the senses.

532
01:24:38,420 --> 01:24:41,321
Drink. Drink deep, my hero...

533
01:24:42,558 --> 01:24:45,789
to enhance the thousand pleasures
I will give you.

534
01:24:51,033 --> 01:24:53,001
Where is Cassiopea?

535
01:24:53,368 --> 01:24:56,735
She is about to be turned to ashes.

536
01:25:02,377 --> 01:25:06,245
Stop him! Don't kill him,
but don't let him escape!

537
01:25:06,882 --> 01:25:08,474
Go, block him.

538
01:25:27,703 --> 01:25:29,136
Open.

539
01:27:10,505 --> 01:27:12,837
Take me to Cassiopea, now.

540
01:27:13,942 --> 01:27:15,432
Follow me.

541
01:27:27,889 --> 01:27:30,858
This is the phoenix, the fire bird.

542
01:27:32,194 --> 01:27:34,424
At last in my power.

543
01:27:35,230 --> 01:27:37,323
You captured the phoenix?

544
01:27:38,333 --> 01:27:40,302
And it's here, in this volcano?

545
01:27:40,402 --> 01:27:42,870
Yes, my dear, this volcano...

546
01:27:43,205 --> 01:27:47,309
with its inexhaustible energy,
is concentrated here...

547
01:27:47,409 --> 01:27:49,775
dedicated to the glory of Thira.

548
01:27:50,812 --> 01:27:53,280
It is the source of my strength.

549
01:27:54,049 --> 01:27:57,678
Just as the phoenix
is renewed in the destruction...

550
01:27:58,086 --> 01:28:01,078
of its own ashes, so my strength...

551
01:28:01,223 --> 01:28:04,059
is renewed every summer
of the seventh equinox...

552
01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:05,927
when I offer it a virgin bride.

553
01:28:06,027 --> 01:28:08,018
This night, Cassiopea...

554
01:28:08,764 --> 01:28:11,426
you will become bride of the phoenix.

555
01:28:12,801 --> 01:28:16,638
You will descend into the sea of fire
in this golden shell...

556
01:28:16,738 --> 01:28:19,400
and be fused into total energy.

557
01:28:31,953 --> 01:28:34,114
- But that's the sword...
- Yes.

558
01:28:34,523 --> 01:28:36,616
The sacred sword of Thebes.

559
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:42,560
Adriana stole it for me
from the temple of Hera, 20 years ago.

560
01:28:43,899 --> 01:28:47,665
It's the sword
that holds the key to my power.

561
01:28:48,703 --> 01:28:50,972
It was made
by the ancient makers of weapons...

562
01:28:51,072 --> 01:28:54,166
from pieces of a star
that had fallen from the sky.

563
01:28:55,143 --> 01:28:58,772
A small, lost star that had the power
to control fire.

564
01:29:00,348 --> 01:29:03,317
Beyond this point,
the phoenix cannot rise.

565
01:29:04,386 --> 01:29:08,618
I, King Minos of Thira,
control the fire bird.

566
01:29:09,024 --> 01:29:12,152
I forced it to make its nest here
in my volcano.

567
01:29:13,195 --> 01:29:16,098
The beginning and end of all energy...

568
01:29:16,198 --> 01:29:18,564
into which you will now descend.

569
01:29:18,967 --> 01:29:22,869
Cassiopea, I command you. Get in.

570
01:29:57,205 --> 01:29:59,332
Tell them to open that door.

571
01:29:59,908 --> 01:30:01,432
Tell them now.

572
01:30:02,811 --> 01:30:05,279
Guards, kill him!

573
01:30:52,294 --> 01:30:55,195
- At last, you fail!
- Damn you!

574
01:31:22,857 --> 01:31:24,051
<i>You....</i>

575
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:35,492
You're too reliant
on your strength, my hero.

576
01:31:41,042 --> 01:31:44,569
You look muscle-bound,
but you're pretty agile, aren't you?

577
01:31:52,053 --> 01:31:54,112
Hercules, I'm down here!

578
01:32:05,066 --> 01:32:08,126
I had another fate
in store for you, Hercules.

579
01:32:10,071 --> 01:32:12,301
Pity it has to end like this.

580
01:32:22,651 --> 01:32:25,950
Don't touch that sword.
You'll free the phoenix.

581
01:32:27,489 --> 01:32:29,457
The volcano will erupt!

582
01:32:32,427 --> 01:32:35,863
This sword consecrated to Zeus
fears nothing!

583
01:33:04,025 --> 01:33:07,188
- Hercules, please hurry.
- Cassiopea!

584
01:33:17,505 --> 01:33:19,234
Hercules, hurry.

585
01:33:27,082 --> 01:33:29,050
The volcano is erupting.

586
01:33:35,256 --> 01:33:36,484
Stop.

587
01:33:37,559 --> 01:33:40,221
You've won, but she's dead.

588
01:34:55,570 --> 01:34:56,935
That way.

589
01:35:52,427 --> 01:35:55,630
The phoenix is free from the evil
that held it prisoner.

590
01:35:55,730 --> 01:35:58,399
Its fire is free now to serve
the universe.

591
01:35:58,499 --> 01:36:00,869
The world has nothing more to fear.

592
01:36:00,969 --> 01:36:03,403
Neither do I, with you in my arms.

593
01:36:04,138 --> 01:36:06,572
- Kiss me, Hercules.
- Wait.

594
01:36:07,308 --> 01:36:09,299
Are you really Cassiopea?

595
01:36:10,144 --> 01:36:13,773
Or Adriana in a new form?
Or Circe reborn?

596
01:36:14,616 --> 01:36:17,084
I'm all of them, and none of them.

597
01:36:18,052 --> 01:36:20,452
I'm the one who truly loves you.

598
