00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:56,371
<i>People will say I am
a monster for what I've done.</i>

3
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:59,044
<i>And maybe they're right.</i>

4
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,548
<i>I always thought
that I'd have more...</i>

5
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,838
<i>- time.</i>
- Dad?

6
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,586
Dad!

7
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:08,837
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

8
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:11,715
Peter?

9
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:28,983
<i>He likes to sleep
with the light on at night.</i>

10
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,734
Mary, we have to go.

11
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:35,660
Dad.

12
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,118
Be good.

13
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,506
I found a safe place for us to spend
the night at Lake Geneva.

14
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,726
- Are you uploading it?
- To Roosevelt. All of it.

15
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,595
Just in case we...

16
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,107
We're gonna be fine, Mary.

17
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,772
Did you see his face?
He's never gonna understand.

18
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,645
Mary, we've been through this.

19
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,697
Our life as we know it is over.

20
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:13,493
We're gonna spend every day
from now on looking over our shoulders.

21
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,663
Never feeling safe.
We can't do that to him.

22
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,661
He's just a little boy.

23
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,750
I know, I know.
But it's gonna be okay.

24
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,287
It's gonna be all right.

25
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,017
No rest for the weary, huh?

26
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,231
No, I'm afraid not.

27
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,483
Occupational hazard, I guess.

28
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,524
What is it you're working on?

29
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,327
Uh, just planning ahead. Do you
think I could speak with the pilot?

30
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,450
Something you need?

31
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,790
Perhaps I can help.

32
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,677
I'd just like to radio ahead
and make sure everything's in order

33
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,040
for when we land.

34
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:08,256
I think we both know

35
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:09,818
that's not an option, Dr. Parker.

36
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,600
Richard.

37
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,852
- They say you're a genius.
- Richard!

38
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:31,525
Not if you thought
you could escape.

39
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:32,332
Richard!

40
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:34,650
Mary!

41
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,415
Mary!

42
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,556
Mare.

43
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,147
It's okay. It's okay.
That's okay. It's okay.

44
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,562
I got you. I have you,
okay? Okay?

45
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,193
Just gonna make you safe.

46
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,904
It's done. It's done.
Can you breathe? Mare?

47
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:15,775
Roosevelt.
What?

48
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,116
Roosevelt.

49
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:28,649
It's back up. It's back up.
Oh...

50
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,298
It's back up, okay? Hey, hey, hey.

51
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,752
We're gonna be all right, okay?
You stay with me.

52
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,331
Whoo!

53
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,953
Ow!

54
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,382
Yee-hee! Hoo-hoo!

55
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,265
What do you got for me today,
New York?

56
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,431
<i>Reporting live from
New York 1 chopper.</i>

57

<i>An Oscorp truck carrying plutonium

<i>A police chase is in progress.</i>

59
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,559
All right. Let's get to work.

60
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,733
Say hello to Aleksei Sytsevich!

61
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,185
Spider-Man!

62
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,982
Hello, pedestrians.

63
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:55,828
Knock, knock.

64
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,833
Mr. Criminal?

65
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:01,462
Hey, my name is Spider-Man. You can call
me Web-Head, you can call me Amazing,

66
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,962
just don't call me late for dinner.
You get it? Whoa!

67
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,722
Not a shaker? Are you a hugger?

68
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,387
I am killer!
Whoa, okay.

69
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,512
<i>Warning. Plutonium-238

<i>and is highly explosive.</i>

71
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:19,476
Excuse me. There's more room on
the sidewalk, folks, please.

72
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,566
- Watch it, man.
- I got blueprints here.

73
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:22,817
A little help?

74
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,190
A little help, please.

75
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,529
You having a problem with your gun?
Let me help you out with that.

76
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,204
Whoa. Coming through.

77
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:35,541
Too much work...

78
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,322
Oh, this is bad.

79
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:39,712
I'm gonna be right back.
Aah!

80
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,252
Heads up. Watch out.

81
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,799
Whoo... Okay. Okay.
There you go.

82
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,801
You okay? You all right?
You're Spider-Man.

83
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:55,349
Costume gives it away?
These look pretty important, Max.

84
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,438
"Max"? How do you know my name?

85
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,852
It's written on your badge.

86
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,100
I'm a nobody.

87
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,569
Hey, you're not a nobody.
You're a somebody.

88
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:03,482
Lick that.

89
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,071
All right. Listen to me.

90
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,360
Now I need you.
Really?

91
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,126
You're my eyes and ears out here.
Okay.

92
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,238
All right?
All right.

93
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:10,576
I'll see you out there.

94
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,872
<i>Warning. Violation of protocol.</i>

96
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,906
Get him, Spidey!

97
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,124
Gotcha. Gotcha. Nope. Got you too.

98
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,622
Hey. No. You.
You're not going anywhere.

99
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,374
Come here. Come here.
Come to Daddy.

100
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,966
Get the hell out of the way!

101
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,715
Okay. Stop it! Stop it! Whew.

102
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,433
Oh, come on.

103
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,602
Hey, wait. Come back here.

104
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,139
Heel!

105
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:22,732
I got you.

106
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:37,824
Hey, I'm sorry, I'm running a bit late.
I got stuck in some traffic.

107
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,870
Your timing is terrible.
It started already.

108
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,459
<i>I know, I'm sorry.</i>
Where are you?

109
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,419
<i>1st and Broadway, 2nd and Broadway,
3rd and Broadway.</i>

110
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,254
Five minutes. Ten tops.

111
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,212
Are those sirens?
<i>No.</i>

112
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,505
Peter?
<i>No.</i>

113
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,253
Peter?
<i>No sirens.</i>

114
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:52,929
No...

115
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,714
<i>Peter.</i>

116
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:56,516
<i>What is happening?</i>

117
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:57,884
<i>Peter.</i>

118
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,431
<i>Peter.</i>

119
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:05,774
<i>Hello?</i>

120
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:10,234
<i>Peter? Pe...
I'll be right there. Promise.</i>

121
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,860
This year's Valedictorian,
please welcome Gwen Stacy.

122
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,092
Good morning, esteemed faculty,

123
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,211
and families of my fellow graduates.

124
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,680
It's an honor to be
standing up here today.

125
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:43,846
Hello.

126
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,519
Hey! Get off!
I told you.

127
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,563
I am running a bit late.

128
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,402
It's over, Spider.

129
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:50,645
Really?!

130
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,863
I know we all think that we're immortal.

131
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,733
We're supposed to feel that way.

132
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,075
We're graduating.

133
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,988
<i>But, like our brief four years
in high school,</i>

134
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,491
what makes life valuable

135
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,868
<i>is that it doesn't last forever.</i>

136
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,541
What makes it precious
is that it ends.

137
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,605
<i>And I know that now more than ever.</i>

138
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,635
<i>And I say it,</i>

139
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,383
<i>today of all days,</i>

140
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,265
to remind us that time is luck.

141
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,560
<i>So don't waste it
living someone else's life.</i>

142
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:29,480
Make yours count for something.

143
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,860
Fight for what matters to you.

144
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,355
No matter what.

145
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,990
Because even if we fall short,

146
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,948
what better way is there to live?

147
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,549
I'll take that. That's not yours.

148
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,213
Huh?

149
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,559
This is not end, Spider!

150
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,061
Michael Oates.

Peter Parker.

155
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,502
Hey, I think I know that guy.

156
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:31,917
Peter Park...

157
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,709
I'm sorry.

158
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:50,057
Ha, ha. Wait, do that again.
Do that again. Oh.

159
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:55,107
Peter, for Lord's sakes, I almost stole
a cap and gown to run up there myself.

160
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:58,527
I'd love to have seen that. That would've
been awesome. No, no, this is for you.

161
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,525
I am so proud of you.
You earned it.

162
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:03,153
Sweetheart, I'm so proud of you.

163
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,992
I know the first thing your Uncle Ben
would say.

164
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,240
Yeah, I know too.

165
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,619
"You better hurry up, party's over.
You gotta get a job."

166
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:14,964
The second thing he would say, "Don't
just follow the path, make your own trail."

167
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:16,458
Ralph Waldo Emerson.

168
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,254
No.
What do you mean, no?

169
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,879
Ha-ha-ha! Ben told me he made it up.

170
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,306
You really did
learn something here.

171
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,854
I wish your uncle
could have been here.

172
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,266
Yeah, me too.

173
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,435
And my folks.

174
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,400
Yeah. Yeah.

175
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:43,200
- Would've been good.
- Perfect d...

176
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,949
All right, you can go. Go on.
Huh?

177
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,196
I'll be right back.

178
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,167
- Is that your program?
- Okay, guys. Get together right now.

179
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,911
A quick one. All right. Cheese.

180
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,754
Cheese.
Cheese.

181
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:57,920
Okay. I'll just be over here.
Yeah, just give me two seconds.

182
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,759
Don't go too far.
It's good to see you.

183
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:01,469
All right.
All right.

184
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:03,345
Hey.

185
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,553
Did your traffic jam
have anything to do with

186
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,676
the Russian Mob

187
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,805
and machine guns by any chance?
Why didn't you just tell me?

188
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,056
What am I gonna do?
You're about to do your speech.

189
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,025
- Gwen. Honey. Family photo.
- Yes?

190
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:17,109
Okay.

191
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,274
Hey. You coming to dim sum?

192
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,280
Can't keep me away.

193
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,864
It's at 8:00. Don't be late.

194
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,324
I won't be.
Okay.

195
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:28,905
And I'm gonna do my speech
for you.

196
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,373
All night? I wanna hear it
all night long.

197
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,664
Over and over again, all night long.
Okay.

198
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,578
Oh, my gosh.
It was pretty good.

199
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,798
Great. Peter. Join us?
Come on.

200
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:44,592
I gotta find my aunt, but
I'm gonna catch up later, thank you.

201
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,680
Hi.

202
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,268
<i>You're gonna make enemies.</i>

203
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,304
<i>People will get hurt.</i>

204
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,233
<i>So I want you to promise me
something, okay?</i>

205
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:01,358
Leave Gwen out of it.

206
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:05,116
<i>Promise me that.</i>

207
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,069
She's gonna take
one quick picture, okay?

208
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:23,255
Peter's outside. I'm gonna
go see if he's okay.

209
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,221
What are you doing?
What are you?

210
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,682
Peter.

211
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:34,850
What is it?

212
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,394
Hey.
What's wrong?

213
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:39,730
Are you all right?

214
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,353
I don't know what I'm doing.

215
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,527
It's my father, isn't it?

216
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,199
Yeah.

217
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,489
I see him everywhere I go.

218
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:54,286
I can't... I don't know what to do.
And I can't get him out of my head.

219
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:57,331
Yeah, but we've talked about this.
I know, but, Gwen...

220
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,454
It's not his choice.
Gwen.

221
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:03,625
I promised him that
I would keep away from you.

222
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,879
And now I'm gonna come and
eat dinner with your family.

223
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,264
How can I do this?
What does this make me?

224
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,758
I don't know,
what does that make you?

225
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,387
It makes me not able to
live with myself.

226
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,268
I thought that it meant you loved me.
I do love you.

227
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,650
I love you.

228
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,108
Then why isn't that enough?

229
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:30,735
Huh?

230
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,953
Because what if
something happens to you

231
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,698
just like it happened to him
because of me?

232
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,122
No, wait, wait, wait.
Listen. No, n...

233
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,041
I cannot let that happen.

234
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:42,918
Listen to me.

235
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:44,837
You're Spider-Man...

236
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:47,631
and I love that.

237
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:52,132
But I love Peter Parker more.

238
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:56,810
That's worth it to me.

239
00:18:58,012 --> 00:18:59,889
I can't lose you too.

240
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:04,815
If because you can't lose me,
we can't be together,

241
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,399
who does that work out for, Peter?

242
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,828
I can't. I'm sorry, Gwen.

243
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,324
Wow.

244
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:21,127
You have done this to me

245
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:25,840
again and again, Peter.

246
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:28,335
I can't live like this.

247
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,429
I break up with you.

248
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,934
I break up with you.

249
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,426
<i>Good morning, New Yorkers.</i>

250
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:21,020
<i>Looking for another beautiful day
here in the city.</i>

251
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:22,559
<i>A few clouds to start us off...</i>

252
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:26,059
<i>The steady increase in sightings
of Spider-Man has sparked a debate</i>

253
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,686
<i>over the role of vigilantism
in American crime fighting.</i>

254
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:29,976
<i>How about that Spider-Man?</i>

255
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,565
<i>Last night on the Manhattan Bridge,
he saved a dozen lives.</i>

256
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:34,408
<i>We wanna hear your calls.</i>

257
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,995
<i>I think without Spider-Man,
there'd be no hope for this city.</i>

258
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,366
<i>Who do you think pays the bills
for all the damages he causes, huh?</i>

259
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:42,707
<i>It's you and me, taxpayers.</i>

260
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,497
You make this?
Yeah.

261
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,624
This is a wind turbine.

262
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:49,294
You made this? No way.

263
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:50,966
This is amazing.

264
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:53,673
It's good as new, right?

265
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:55,805
I'll walk you home.

266
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,848
What's your name?
Jorge.

267
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,309
Jorge? I'm Spider-Man.

268
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:03,475
<i>I don't feel like my kids
are safe with him out there.</i>

269
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:06,565
<i>Get out of the way
and let the police do their job.</i>

270
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:10,607
<i>Some folks think that there
might be more than one Spider-Man.</i>

271
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,401
<i>What do you think?</i>

272
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,320
<i>One guy or many?</i>

273
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:18,410
<i>I'd love to know
who's behind that mask.</i>

274
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:19,653
Hey.

275
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:21,372
Nice outfit.
Thanks.

276
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:24,774
<i>We have a caller on the line
named Max. He says he knows Spider-Man.</i>

277
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,829
<i>Listen, I'm upset. Spider-Man,
to me, is being misunderstood.</i>

278
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,422
<i>He's a very, very good person.
He's protecting us.</i>

279
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,883
<i>He saved my life one time.</i>

280
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,365
<i>We sort of became best friends.</i>

281
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:37,463
How much?

282
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:38,930
Hey, you're that spider guy.

283
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:40,299
I'm Spider-Man.

284
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:41,342
Huh?

285
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,147
I'm Spider-Man.

286
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:50,268
<i>This Spider-Man... He's not
the police, he's not a fireman.</i>

287
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:53,317
<i>What gives him the right to get
involved in other people's business?</i>

288
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:26,433
Peter, honey?

289
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:28,605
Can I come in?

290
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,600
No!

291
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,899
Peter, the final starts at 9, honey.

292
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,230
You said you would
take my car into the shop

293
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,948
because it keeps dying,
remember?

294
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,114
Give me a second, Aunt May. I'm gonna
get the door. Just give me a second.

295
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,158
Peter, please just let me in.
All right?

296
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:44,405
I'm trying to get my...

297
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:47,829
You said your final was at 9, and
you're gonna take my car into the shop.

298
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,749
No! You can't come in. I'm so naked.
What are you do...?

299
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:56,627
Peter! For goodness sakes. You said you're gonna
take my car into the shop because it Kee...!

300
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,846
Are you all right?
Yeah. I'm okay.

301
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,213
I'm just...

302
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,007
I'm very naked right now.

303
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,475
What happened to your face?
It's filthy.

304
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,807
It is?
Yes.

305
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,852
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I was cleaning the chimney.

306
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:12,941
We have no chimney.

307
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,477
What?

308
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,195
You're late.
I know, I'm late.

309
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:18,064
Downstairs, now.

310
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:21,067
Can you leave? Because I'm naked here.
All right, I'm leaving.

311
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:24,699
Morning, I love you.
I love you too. Hurry up.

312
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,038
Whoa. Well, look who's here.

313
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,452
Spidey.

314
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:11,284
How was your morning?

315
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:13,627
Aces, Max, aces.

316
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,871
I've been out saving the world.

317
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,460
Protecting everybody.

318
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,459
But is someone celebrating
a birthday today?

319
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,012
That's why you're here.

320
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,178
You remembered my birthday.

321
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,099
All the crime-fighting you've
been doing, and all of a sudden,

322
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:34,849
you take time out to come visit
little old me. Max. It's amazing to...

323
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:37,901
But of course you would.

324
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,653
Why wouldn't you visit me?

325
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:41,735
We're best friends.

326
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:48,071
What are you doing?
You made me a cake?

327
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,520
People don't get a chance to see these
small, kind things that you do for people.

328
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,538
I know what they say about you
in the press

329
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:55,912
but it doesn't matter to me.
I know the real you.

330
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,754
Because you're amazing.

331
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:01,046
Wow. That's what the press needs.

332
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:04,135
They should call you
The Amazing Spider-Man.

333
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,221
You like that, Spidey?

334
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,386
I like it a lot, Max.

335
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:11,310
Good. Because today

336
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:13,099
is going to be

337
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,346
amazing.

338
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,108
Yeah. Circuit 39.

339
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:24,982
I'm not late, Harvey.
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

340
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:28,202
I just wanna know if you
can find another waitress

341
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:30,788
to replace me because I start
my training rounds

342
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,122
at the hospital.

343
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,913
And don't mention this to Peter.
I don't want him to know.

344
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:36,456
Because he'll worry.

345
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:39,080
Uh, yeah. Yeah. Okay, you got it.

346
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,876
Uh, double shift on Thursday.

347
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,628
Okay, bye.

348
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,133
Who was that?
Harvey.

349
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:51,426
Doing a double shift, huh?
Sometimes.

350
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,928
Got nothing else to do.
I like the girls.

351
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:57,557
I miss Ben. Gives me a little extra
in the cookie jar. Heh.

352
00:25:58,015 --> 00:25:59,392
MM.

353
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,986
Well, I sold another couple of photos
to the <i>Bugle,</i> so that ought to help.

354
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:06,323
Yeah, it would really help if that guy
would pay you a fair wage.

355
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,033
Jameson pays me a fair wage.

356
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,619
If it was 1961, he pays me a fair wage.

357
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:14,286
Hey, wait. What are you doing? What
are you doing? No, I do the laundry.

358
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,533
I'm doing my laundry.
No, I do the laundry.

359
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:20,288
No, this is my job. I've been doing
your laundry since you were 6 years old.

360
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,164
I understand that. I'm in college now.

361
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,133
I think it's time that I took care of
my own dirty underwear.

362
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,935
Last time you did the laundry,
you turned everything blue and red

363
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,129
so no.
That was a mistake.

364
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:32,383
Because I was washing
the American flag.

365
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:35,682
My... Can I please just...?
No one washes a flag.

366
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:36,968
I do, and I won't anymore.

367
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,181
This is my machine.
Fine. It's just underwear.

368
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,854
This is my laundry, my home,
my machine.

369
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,398
Back off, eat your breakfast.

370
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:48,281
All right, laundry sheriff.
I'll do it later.

371
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:49,867
I'll do it.
No, forget it.

372
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,907
Give it to me.
I'll do it some other time.

373
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,537
Hey.
Excuse me.

374
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,872
Jerk.

375
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:58,992
Not gonna make it.

376
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,665
Logjam. Come on, come on,
come on.

377
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,797
- Watch it, buddy.
- Hey, let's go.

378
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:13,925
<i>Oscorp Industries</i>

379
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:18,600
<i>is proud to announce the world's
first electromagnetic power grid.</i>

380
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:23,184
<i>By converting aging power stations

381
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:26,937
<i>we are generating clean, green,

<i>and eventually the world

384
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:35,446
Dillon. You're late.
Doggone trains are so slow, sir.

385
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:37,539
Don't you realize Oscorp
is now responsible

386
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,328
for the entire city's
energy supply?

387
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,543
I submitted a lot of designs
for the power grid

388
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,913
and they used a lot of them,
and I noticed that,

389
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:46,666
and those power grids
were designed by me.

390
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:48,088
You designed them?

391
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:50,468
Sure you did.

392
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,216
And I'm Spider-Man.

393
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,508
You're no Spider-Man!
He's a Leo, you're a Sagittarius!

394
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:58,886
You besmirch him again, I'm gonna
rip your well-groomed head off!

395
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,104
Now, get to work.

396
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,562
<i>What floor, please?</i>

397
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:07,111
Seventy-four.
<i>Thank you.</i>

398
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:08,645
Oh, hold that!

399
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:11,111
Can you hold that, please?
I got it.

400
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,324
Thank you,
you're a real gentleman.

401
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:15,365
Most people would have
just let those close.

402
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:17,238
Most people
don't notice other people.

403
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,865
<i>What floor, please?</i>
Um, ahem... Sixty-three...

404
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,708
I got it. I got it. What is it?

405
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:22,997
Uh, sixty-three.

406
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,128
Sixty-three, please.

407
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,417
<i>- Thank you.</i>
- In a hurry.

408
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,882
Thank you very much.

409
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:34,925
Um... I'm Max. Max Dillon.

410
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:36,515
I'm Gwen.

411
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:38,555
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

412
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,012
Is it your birthday?

413
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:46,229
Oh, yeah. Well, I... They... Friends
of mine made this flyer up.

414
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,318
I'm having a birthday party
at a big club.

415
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,028
A lot of celebrities.
Wow.

416
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:53,319
Would love to invite you,
it's just that the guest list is closed.

417
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,739
Oh, got it. Got it.
Well, thank you anyway.

418
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,879
- That's exciting.
<i>- ... dressed as Spider-Man</i>

419
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,201
<i>hanging out near the blaze.</i>

420
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:03,872
It must be cool, huh? To have
the whole world look at you like that?

421
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:07,337
You know, Spider-Man
saved my life one time.

422
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,423
Out of all the people
in the whole city, he saved

423
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:11,667
me.

424
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:13,551
He said he needed me.

425
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:16,805
That must be a good feeling.

426
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,345
<i>Sixty-third floor.</i>

427
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:21,844
Oh. It was nice
to meet you, Max.

428
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:26,557
Wait. She remembered my name.

429
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,250
Welcome home.

430
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,676
It's dark in there.

431
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:01,008
Your eyes will adjust.

432
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:04,178
It's better this way.

433
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:34,545
Dad.

434
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:44,222
This is not how I imagined
I would die.

435
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,312
Looking at my son

436
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:49,644
and seeing a stranger.

437
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:54,565
You have such potential, Harry.

438
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:58,490
Such fierce intelligence,

439
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:00,575
and you're throwing it all away.

440
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,819
No, you threw me away.

441
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:08,242
You kicked me off to
boarding school when I was 11.

442
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:12,045
On my 16th birthday,

443
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,005
you sent me Scotch.

444
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:16,341
Or one of your assistants did.

445
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:19,424
I'm pretty sure
because the card read:

446
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:24,054
"With compliments, Norman Osborn."

447
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:27,018
I don't expect forgiveness
from you

448
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,770
anymore.

449
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,607
I don't believe in miracles.

450
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:35,568
How could you
possibly understand

451
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:39,611
that your childhood
had to be sacrificed

452
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,608
for something greater?

453
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,282
And not just for me.

454
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:45,953
For you!

455
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:51,160
Has your hand
started to twitch yet?

456
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,707
When you lay awake
and you feel it coming,

457
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,760
hiding under your skin,

458
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:03,092
waiting to show itself.

459
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:05,682
To show you

460
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,723
who you really are.

461
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,521
Retroviral hyperplasia.

462
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,817
I never told you...

463
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:23,074
that it's genetic.

464
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,741
Our disease,

465
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:30,074
the Osborn curse.

466
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:33,460
And it began at your age.

467
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,246
Let me see it.

468
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,337
Your hand. Give it to me.

469
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:51,812
The greatest inheritance
I can give you

470
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:53,931
isn't merely money.

471
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:55,182
It's this.

472
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:59,357
The sum total of all my work.

473
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:03,574
Everything I did to stay alive.

474
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,280
Maybe you can succeed

475
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,528
where I failed.

476
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:36,728

00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:44,280
<i>who is the sole heir
of the Oscorp corporate empire.</i>

480
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:45,740
Harry.

481
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:49,202
<i>Osborn changed the medical
profession's approach to human healing</i>

482
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,830
<i>and affected
the lives of millions.</i>

483
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:56,535
<i>I started Oscorp because I looked at
the world around me and I thought:</i>

484
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:59,254
<i>"We can do better.
And we should do better."</i>

485
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:04,878
<i>Einstein said, "The world cannot be
changed without changing our thinking."</i>

486
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,629
<i>But change isn't just a slogan.</i>

487
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,764
<i>It begins with hard work.</i>

488
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:13,431
<i>Change begins with
persistence and commitment.</i>

489
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:17,184
Mr. Osborn changed the world.

490
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:21,685
And now it's up to each of us to ensure
that his hopes and dreams remain alive.

491
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,144
But not today.

492
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:25,730
Today is for mourning.

493
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:28,109
- Hello?
<i>- Is this Gwen Stacy?</i>

494
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:29,484
Yes, it is. Who's calling?

495
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:33,534
<i>I'm calling from the Oxford Scholars
Program. We have some exciting news.</i>

496
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:40,913
Whoa. Dillon. You stay here.
What?

497
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,882
There's a current flow problem in the lab.
Why don't you take a look?

498
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:46,764
It's my birthday. Everybody else
is leaving. Why do I have to stay?

499
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:49,304
- Because you're special.
- Smythe.

500
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:50,923
I mean, Mr. Smythe.

501
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:52,720
Happy birthday.

502
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,851

All right. Just a little sick.

508
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:14,947
MM-hm. I got your medicine, though.

509
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:19,626
I'm so sick that I can't get to my birthday
after all I put together for this company.

510
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:20,915

I know. Just a little indigestion.

513

I bet you didn't know it was
my birthday, huh, did you, Kari?

514
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,596
Think you can sing
"Happy Birthday" for me?

515
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,806
I'll just have to sing it
for myself.

516

- Gilbert?
<i>- What?</i>

Fine. I'll do it myself.

<i>Harry,</i>

533
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,682
Oscorp's been under
intense public scrutiny

534
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:00,097
in the wake of
Dr. Connors' recent, uh,

535
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,435
breach of trust.

536
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:03,021
You mean people are pissed off

537
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:06,187
because he tried to turn everyone
in New York City into giant lizards.

538
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,686
Given that,

539
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:13,361
all the animal hybrid programs
he was involved in were destroyed

540
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,859
to restore investor confidence.

541
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:19,704
Ah. That is the Osborn way.

542
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:23,541
Whatever's inconvenient around here,
just get rid of it, right?

543
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:27,292
Much of that scrutiny
may fall on you now.

544
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:30,670
We felt that plausible deniability
was your best option.

545
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,667
Sure, sure. I get it.

546
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:35,174
Twenty-year-old kid.

547
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,096
Two hundred billion dollar company.

548
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:38,931
What was Dad thinking?

549
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,684
I mean, you're all lawyers,
right?

550
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:47,353
Surely, someone must've questioned
his sanity in the end.

551
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,728
Someone must've thought about having
him declared legally incompetent.

552
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:53,196
It would've made this conversation
a lot easier.

553
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:55,736
Harry...
it's Mr. Osborn.

554
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:59,115
We're not friends.

555
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:05,830
Hi.

556
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:12,591
You were his assistant, right?

557
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,051
MM-hm.

558
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:17,553
What's your name?

559
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:19,465
Felicia.

560
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:20,886
Felicia.

561
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:22,718
From now on,

562
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:26,767
everybody at this table
works for Felicia

563
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:30,563
because Felicia works for me.

564
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:33,900
Would anybody like to speak up?

565
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:39,526
Well, good. Then you can all
keep your jobs a little longer.

566
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:44,163
Sir, there's a Peter
Parker here to see you.

567
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:55,591
Felicia, I wanna see every file
on this list.

568
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:58,845
Every single one.

569
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:07,895
Peter Parker.

570
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,266
It's like seeing a ghost.

571
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:13,769
Hey, Harry.

572
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,819
Random.

573
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,649
What, 10 years.
It's eight.

574
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:21,242
But you're close.

575
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:23,574
What's up?

576
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,913
I saw the news, man.

577
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:29,372
I heard about your dad
and I wanted to come and...

578
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:33,622
Just wanted to come and see you.
Check to see how you were doing.

579
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,374
I'm with some people.

580
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,129
I'm in a...

581
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:42,923
I'm in a meeting.

582
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,765
I'm sorry,
I don't wanna intrude.

583
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:46,510
I know it's been a long time.

584
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:49,809
I kind of know exactly
what you're going through right now.

585
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,648
And you were so there for me
when my parents...

586
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,985
Well, that's why I'm here for you.

587
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:57,812
Thank you.

588
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:01,904
Ah, it's good to see you, man.

589
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,612
It's good to see you.

590
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,406
I'm sorry about your dad.

591
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,537
You got your braces off.

592
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:20,878
Now there's nothing to distract
from your unibrow.

593
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,802
There he is.

594
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,680
<i>There he is.
Ha-ha-ha.</i>

595
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:30,804
You still blow-dry your hair
every morning?

596
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:35,776
Um... You know, one of my
manservants holds the hair dryer

597
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:37,815
but I work the comb, okay?
Ha-ha-ha.

598
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:42,066
So at least
I'm not completely helpless.

599
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:44,317
You're stupid.

600
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:53,202
After graduation, I went
to Brazil, then Singapore.

601
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,571
- That's right, yeah.
- Yeah.

602
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,500
And then Europe.
You know, I went to Europe.

603
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:57,872
I saw you.

604
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,042
What do you mean, you saw me?

605
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,451
I saw you in some magazine
with some French supermodel.

606
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:04,421
You know what I'm talking about?

607
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:06,344
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ha-ha-ha.
Ha-ha-ha.

608
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:09,342
Dude, that whole model thing
is so exhausting.

609
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:10,889
I know.

610
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,565
What? You got a lady?

611
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:20,194
Uh...

612
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,905
That's a question.

613
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,449
That's a question.

614
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:26,944
Unh.
Whoa, buddy.

615
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:29,537
No, I don't.

616
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:31,702
Yeah.

617
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,166
I don't know. It's, uh...

618
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:39,547
I don't know. It's complicated.

619
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,632
Yeah, I don't do complicated.

620
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:46,595
Uh, what's her name? Who is she?

621
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:47,964
Her name's Gwen.

622
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,886
Gwen Stacy.

623
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:53,390
Gwen Stacy.
She works for you.

624
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,104
Really? She works for me?

625
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:58,646
She does work-study at Oscorp.
Is she a model employee?

626
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,857
You know, when my father
sent me away

627
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:05,983
I tried to forget
everything about this place.

628
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:10,404
I guess that kind of
included you.

629
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,034
You ain't gotta explain
anything to me, man.

630
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,329
We both got dumped.

631
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:25,335
You ever figure out
why your parents bailed?

632
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:31,094
My dad left a briefcase.

633
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:34,098
That's all I got,
briefcase full of junk.

634
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:36,687
Whatever. I don't know.
I try not to think about it.

635
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,681
How's that working out for you?

636
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,725
Perfectly.

637
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,109
Dude. Nice arm.

638
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:51,995
It's just the wrist. It's just all
in the wrist, buddy.

639
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,441
<i>You could do it too
if you just strengthened up that.</i>

640
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:55,956
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

641
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:59,711
<i>You gotta admit, though. Things
have gotten crazy around here, man.</i>

642
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:02,046
<i>Giant lizards</i>

643
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:04,545
and spider guys.

644
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:09,470
Just one guy. Just one spider man.

645
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:13,012
Or woman. We don't know for sure.

646
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:17,346
Whatever, dude. He wears spandex
to rescue kittens from trees.

647
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:19,689
I'm so impressed.

648
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:22,025
I kind of like to think
he gives people hope.

649
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:23,894
For what?

650
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:26,862
Maybe eventually
everything's gonna be all right.

651
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:29,483
Yeah, I just wish I had time
for "eventually."

652
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:34,825
Who was he?

653
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:37,824
Maxwell Dillon.
Electrical engineer.

654
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:40,831
No associates or friends
to speak of.

655
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,419
He submitted specs for the grid
that we appropriated.

656
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:45,790
The guy was

657
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,754
invisible.

658
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:52,593
Wall Street's nervous enough
with that child, Harry, taking over.

659
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:54,841
We've gotta find a way
to get him out.

660
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:58,262
In the meantime, if the press
gets hold of this accident,

661
00:43:58,511 --> 00:43:59,728
our stock will crater.

662
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:03,817
So make sure this Mr. Dillon
stays invisible.

663
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:08,445
This could prove useful for us
in the future.

664
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,672
Hey.

665
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,576
Hey, moron! Get out of the street!

666
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,842
Hey. Hi.

667
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:03,932
Hi.

668
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:06,438
You look amazing.

669
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:12,149
I'm sorry for the spontaneous
outreach. It was kind of...

670
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:14,864
No. I don't... I... Spontaneous...

671
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,233
is all right. You know.

672
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:19,952
Well, I just figured it was time.

673
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:22,284
You know?

674
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,453
Time that we try to be friends.

675
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:26,959
Yeah.

676
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:31,209
Friends, yeah. That's...

677
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,332
great.

678
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:35,835
I just don't want us
to be complicated.

679
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:38,258
I was just saying that
to someone. I hate complicated.

680
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:40,093
Keep it simple.

681
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:44,056
Okay, great, great. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
All right.

682
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:45,554
Well, I mean...

683
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:52,690
Ha, ha. If we're gonna be friends, I think
we gotta establish some ground rules.

684
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,858
Some ground rules?
Yeah, some ground rules.

685
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:56,822
Heh, heh. Heh.
Like that.

686
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,281
Like what?

687
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:01,786
That laugh. That laugh.
What?

688
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:03,575
That's off the table.

689
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,619
My laugh is off the table?
Off the table.

690
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:07,913
You gotta figure out
a more annoying laugh.

691
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:12,251
That's still adorable.

692
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:14,999
That was not adorable.
It's adorable.

693
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:16,466
No, it's not adorable.

694
00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:19,383
Okay. I have a ground rule. Um...
Oh, good.

695
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:21,175
What is it?
Uh...

696
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:23,766
Don't tell me that I look amazing

697
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:28,058
with your big brown doe eyes.
Okay?

698
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:31,107
I'm really serious
about that one.

699
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:34,310
What? Oh. no.

700
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,403
I just figured out
the next ground rule.

701
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:37,771
What?

702
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:39,524
No more of this.

703
00:47:39,774 --> 00:47:41,776
No more of this little nose rub
that you do.

704
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:43,573
This?
Don't think I haven't... Hey.

705
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:46,538
What am I supposed to do?
It's allergy season.

706
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:48,203
This is killing me.

707
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:50,952
You're just spitting in the face
of my ground rules. I'm out.

708
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:52,454
Come on. Heh.

709
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:56,461
First we get ice cream,
and then I'm out.

710
00:48:35,371 --> 00:48:36,543
Um, yeah. So I did that.

711
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:41,670
And I got completely addicted to
this place that has Korean meatballs.

712
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:44,593
Yeah. No, I know.
Have you been there? It's mind-blowing.

713
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:47,217
That place on 6th. I know.
You love it there.

714
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:51,687
How do you know that?

715
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:56,563
Hm?
How do you know I love it there?

716
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:58,527
Because, um...

717
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:02,402
Because you told me.

718
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:07,702
It just opened last month.

719
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:13,284
Have you been following me?

720
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:20,125
I knew it.

721
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:22,001
How often?

722
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:27,090
Just once a day.

723
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:28,682
Sometimes.

724
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,766
Sometimes more.

725
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:38,893
Oh, boy.

726
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:40,394
Why?

727
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,487
Make sure I'm safe?

728
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,202
And...
And what?

729
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:52,870
And because it's the closest
I can get to still being with you.

730
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,217
I'm moving to England.

731
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:16,847
What?

732
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:18,808
Yeah. Um...

733
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:22,855
I have a...
I'm up for a scholarship to Oxford.

734
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:27,112
In molecular medicine. And it's
between me and this other kid.

735
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:29,235
There's this oral exam
that we have to do

736
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:32,238
and he's, like, a freshman
in college, but he's 14.

737
00:50:32,488 --> 00:50:34,365
And... And it's... It could be him.

738
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:36,413
But it might be me. I hope it's me.

739
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:39,959
And I'm thinking that
I'll be moving to England.

740
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:43,173
Wow.
Yeah.

741
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:45,175
And I'm really excited.

742
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:47,924
That's, uh...

743
00:50:51,215 --> 00:50:52,512
England.

744
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:56,679
What?

745
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:55,120
Station, I need a 10-85.

746
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:58,411
Send out additional units to
the south-end corner of Duffy Square.

747
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,500
Folks, could you step to the side?

748
00:52:00,743 --> 00:52:02,871
Everybody get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

749
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,749
Sir, get your hands
away from the cables right now!

750
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:09,919
Sir, get your hands
away from the cables!

751
00:52:10,169 --> 00:52:12,137
Let me see your hands, please!

752
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,181
You stay right where you are!

753
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:16,641
Do not move!

754
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:19,012
Freeze! Get down! On the ground!

755
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:38,531
Get down on the ground, now!

756
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:39,782
Stop!

757
00:52:40,032 --> 00:52:41,512
Get your ass down on the ground! Now!

758
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,373
- It's not my fault!
- Sir!

759
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:45,179
- Stop!
- I'm gonna need for you

760
00:52:45,204 --> 00:52:46,922
Please,
to get down on the ground, now!

761
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:50,338
For your own safety and the safety
of the other patrons in this area.

762
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,258
Oh, my gosh.

763
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:58,308
They see me. You see me.

764
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:01,812
You see me.

765
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:03,897
They see me.

766
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:17,945
No! No! Stop!
On the ground now!

767
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,823
- Don't do that. Please!
- It's over, freak!

768
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:23,371
Wait! It's not my fault.

769
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:24,581
It's not my fault!

770
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:29,002
I said stop!

771
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:38,119
I'm glad you're not one of
those cops that rides a horse.

772
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:47,357
All team members, hold your fire
and wait for my call.

773
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:54,315
<i>All units, hold your fire!
I repeat, hold your fire! Stand down!</i>

774
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:58,361
Stop. Stop it.

775
00:53:58,610 --> 00:53:59,736
Yo, Sparkles!

776
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:02,660
Hey, how you doing?

777
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:06,164
It's you?
Yeah, I know it's me.

778
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:07,286
Who are you?

779
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,330
You don't remember me?

780
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:12,712
No. Should I?

781
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:16,759
I walked into the street. The car
almost hit me. You swooped me up.

782
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:18,426
You saved me.

783
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:20,345
You said you needed me.

784
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:23,265
You're the guy with the blueprints.
Yes.

785
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:24,720
Blueprints.

786
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:29,859
Yes, I remember you. Of course I
remember you. You're my eyes and ears.

787
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,899
Uh, what's your name again?
How could you forget me?

788
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:35,568
I do, I know it, I know it, don't tell me.
It's Max.

789
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,612
Is it "Max"?
Yes.

790
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:39,781
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you
with the...

791
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,703
You look different.

792
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,413
How are you?

793
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:45,499
I don't know what's going on
with me.

794
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:47,792
I can see that. I can...
I believe you.

795
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:53,333
It's strange, the power I feel.
I got so much...

796
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:55,501
I got so much anger.

797
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:58,504
I can see that. I can see you
don't wanna be here and you're scared.

798
00:54:58,754 --> 00:55:00,514
I see you don't know
what's happening to you.

799
00:55:00,756 --> 00:55:02,508
I can see you don't want to
hurt anybody.

800
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,453
- It's gonna be all right.
- Got a clear shot. Standing by.

801
00:55:05,594 --> 00:55:07,554
I don't want them shooting me anymore.
They won't.

802
00:55:07,763 --> 00:55:10,266
You guys. This is my buddy, Max.

803
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:13,861
I told you about Max.
No one shoots at Max!

804
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:16,422
You and me, okay? It's just you
and me talking. Whoa, whoa.

805
00:55:16,605 --> 00:55:19,984
Stay right there. Just be careful.
The grate, because of the electricity.

806
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:21,235
I just...

807
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:24,868
I just wanted everyone to see me.

808
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:27,036
<i>He makes a move, take that shot.</i>

809
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:29,205
How about you come with me?
We'll go talk.

810
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:31,249
Away from all these
people, okay?

811
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:32,462
Yeah, yes.

812
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:35,215
No! No! Stop!

813
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:40,136
Max!

814
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:01,358
<i>Spidey, Spidey, Spidey!</i>

815
00:56:03,235 --> 00:56:05,033
You stupid freak!

816
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:12,953
Electro dummy!

817
00:56:20,669 --> 00:56:22,171
Get out of here, you freak!

818
00:56:22,421 --> 00:56:23,388
Shut up!

819
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:27,718
You're so selfish.

820
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:30,103
Stay with me, Max.

821
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:31,642
You set me up.

822
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:33,106
No, I didn't set you up.

823
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:34,850
You lied to me!

824
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,852
No, I'm trying to help you.
Let me help you.

825
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:25,950
Are you all right?

826
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:33,409
It's my birthday.

827
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:35,627
Now it's time for me
to light my candles.

828
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,745
Do we have visual on Spider-Man?

829
00:58:56,825 --> 00:58:59,294
Does anyone have visual
on Spider-Man?

830
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:12,925
Okay. All right, that's enough. All right.

831
00:59:13,175 --> 00:59:14,552
Mike.
Yeah.

832
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:16,053
Big John.
Nice job.

833
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:17,729
Nice work, fellas.

834
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:20,770
It's a pleasure doing business
with you.

835
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:30,283
Spider-Man.

836
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:37,950
England?

837
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:40,702
Really?

838
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:51,971
Good talk.

839
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:11,570
<i>Our coverage</i>

840
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:14,445
<i>of this breaking story begins with New
York 1's Jessica Abo at the scene.</i>

841
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:19,074
<i>That's right. We're standing here with two eyewitnesses
who are going to tell us what they just saw.</i>

842
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:21,292
<i>Tell us, how do you think
Spider-Man did it?</i>

843
01:00:21,535 --> 01:00:23,095
<i>How do you think
he beat this creature?</i>

844
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:26,715
<i>Yeah, it's gotta be rubberized, Spidey's
suit. That's why he didn't get electrocuted.</i>

845
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:29,255
<i>Probably some kind of neoprene.
That's what I'd use.</i>

846
01:00:29,501 --> 01:00:31,003
<i>Thank you very
much to the two of you.</i>

847
01:00:31,253 --> 01:00:33,722
<i>As you can tell, so many questions
remain unanswered.</i>

848
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:36,524
<i>We will bring you the latest information
as it becomes available.</i>

849
01:00:36,675 --> 01:00:39,035
<i>For now, Jessica Abo, New York 1.
Let's send it back to you.</i>

850
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:29,712
<i>Online polls show a sudden uptick</i>

851
01:02:29,955 --> 01:02:32,333
<i>in public sentiment
in favor of the web-crawler.</i>

852
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:36,382
<i>Tonight, it would seem New York City
owes him a debt of gratitude.</i>

853

<i>Next-generation military body armor.</i>

<i>Features include enhanced mobility,
battlefield injury repair,</i>

01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:16,839
<i>direct nervous system interface.</i>

856
01:03:26,261 --> 01:03:28,059
<i>So the common household spider,</i>

857
01:03:28,305 --> 01:03:29,648
<i>um, unlike human cells,</i>

858
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:32,483
<i>theirs contain the power
to self-heal</i>

859

<i>from severe infection,
tissue damage, et cetera.</i>

<i>We've used a radioactive isotope

<i>Welcome to Dr.
Jallings, Science Investigator.</i>

862
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:49,333
<i>Today we're going to be
talking about electricity.</i>

863
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:52,625
<i>Batteries, insulators,
electromagnetic currents.</i>

864
01:03:52,871 --> 01:03:55,374
<i>Batteries can withstand
a lot of incoming charges.</i>

865
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:58,797
<i>The more powerful the battery,
the bigger the charge it can withstand.</i>

866
01:03:59,044 --> 01:04:02,799
<i>But if the incoming charge
exceeds the outgoing charge</i>

867
01:04:03,048 --> 01:04:05,722
<i>the battery might explode!</i>
Ouch!

868
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:07,219
<i>Explode!</i>

869
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:08,765
<i>Boom!</i>

870
01:04:09,763 --> 01:04:12,892
<i>When doing experiments like this,
always wear protective gear.</i>

871
01:04:13,141 --> 01:04:14,267
<i>You're not invincible.</i>

872
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:16,394
We're gonna need
a bigger battery.

873
01:04:57,852 --> 01:04:59,320
- Hello.
- <i>Pete.</i>

874
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,193
<i>It's me.</i>

875
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:03,157
Hey, Harry. What...?

876
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:05,948
What time is it?

877
01:05:06,361 --> 01:05:09,991
<i>Uh, late, early, I don't know.
I've been up all night.</i>

878
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:11,707
<i>I need to see you.</i>

879
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:13,167
You all right?

880
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:14,787
<i>Not really, Pete.</i>

881
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:16,497
<i>I'm dying.</i>

882
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:19,499
<i>But I think you can help
save my life.</i>

883
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:25,096
<i>You're looking at the world's first
human-spider hybrids.</i>

884
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:28,217
<i>The hope is to extract
the venom from their glands</i>

885
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:30,889
<i>and turn that into a cure.</i>

886
01:05:31,136 --> 01:05:33,730
<i>An agent that heals diseased cells.</i>

887
01:05:33,972 --> 01:05:39,103
<i>And if I can be cured, imagine
what this could do for other diseases</i>

888
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:41,446
<i>like Alzheimer's, even cancer.</i>

889
01:05:45,233 --> 01:05:48,032
They never made it to human trials.

890
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:51,991
It's 14 years of research,
and nothing to show for it.

891
01:05:55,243 --> 01:05:56,460
Except maybe this.

892
01:06:04,586 --> 01:06:06,088
Spider-Man.

893
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:08,340
What about him?

894
01:06:09,007 --> 01:06:12,011
He was bitten by one of
those things, and it worked.

895
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:16,265
I don't know how
and I don't know why,

896
01:06:16,848 --> 01:06:20,148
but he can do everything else
a spider can,

897
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:22,521
including self-heal.

898
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:24,489
I need to find him.

899
01:06:25,273 --> 01:06:26,866
I need his blood.

900
01:06:42,373 --> 01:06:43,750
You need...

901
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:47,011
Spider-Man's blood?

902
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:52,638
It'll save my life.

903
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:54,978
It may not, Har.

904
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:57,560
It may not be that simple.

905
01:06:57,805 --> 01:06:59,565
You saw what happened
to Curt Connors, right?

906
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:00,808
Connors was weak.

907
01:07:01,476 --> 01:07:03,319
This is me, Peter.

908
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:05,655
I don't think you can just
set up a van

909
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:07,815
and have him donate.

910
01:07:08,066 --> 01:07:13,288
I mean, I'm sure he's sensitive
about people shoving needles and...

911
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:14,656
Ah, he's sensitive, okay.

912
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:19,912
Well, then, maybe you could just
sensitively tell me where he is,

913
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:22,459
and I will go ask him myself.

914
01:07:23,081 --> 01:07:23,957
What?

915
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:28,969
You took his picture.
So?

916
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:31,214
You know him.
Harry.

917
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:34,764
I took a picture from a long way away.
I used a long lens.

918
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:36,226
I don't know him.

919
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:41,024
I put together what you said
at the river.

920
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:45,312
What I...
About how he gives people hope.

921
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:48,735
Come on.

922
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:03,542
What in the...?

923
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:10,048
Just say yes.

924
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:18,887
Don't turn your back on me!

925
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:22,686
I don't wanna end up
like my father, Peter.

926
01:08:24,392 --> 01:08:25,814
Please.

927
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:29,030
Peter, please.

928
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:30,649
I can't.

929
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:35,699
Please.

930
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:42,206
I'm gonna try

931
01:08:42,744 --> 01:08:44,712
and find Spider-Man.

932
01:08:55,006 --> 01:08:56,733
Hey, what's security doing over here?

933
01:08:56,758 --> 01:08:57,759
That's so weird.

934
01:08:58,009 --> 01:08:58,929
She's right over there.

935
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:07,777
Hey! Miss Stacy!

936
01:09:24,035 --> 01:09:25,036
Hi.

937
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:26,538
Hi.

938
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:28,168
What are you doing here?

939
01:09:28,706 --> 01:09:30,333
What are you doing here?
Oh...

940
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:33,298
Come here.

941
01:09:40,093 --> 01:09:41,936
She's not here. Check another floor.

942
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:43,725
- Got it.
- Yes, sir!

943
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:45,018
You're in trouble.

944
01:09:45,264 --> 01:09:46,436
Yeah.
Who's that guy?

945
01:09:46,683 --> 01:09:49,444
There was an accident in the genomics
lab, and they're covering it up.

946
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:52,940
And I found out. That guy
from Times Square last night?

947
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:56,363
I met him. He was an electrical
engineer in the building.

948
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:59,579
And he loved Spider-Man,
by the way. He was, like, a fanatic.

949
01:09:59,821 --> 01:10:03,451
I didn't get love vibes. I got more of a
"want to kill me with his electricity" vibe.

950
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:05,748
That's actually kind of what it's like
to love you.

951
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:10,048
I was searching for him in the computer
and all the files, he's erased.

952
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:11,541
My God.
He's completely erased.

953
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:12,963
That's Oscorp.

954
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:15,173
And what about you?
Why are you here?

955
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:16,421
Harry.

956
01:10:16,671 --> 01:10:18,139
Osborn?
He's dying.

957
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:19,932
What do you mean?
He's dying.

958
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:22,597
And he thinks the only thing
that's gonna save his life

959
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:25,518
is my blood,
is Spider-Man's blood.

960
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:28,232
And as far as I know, if I
give it to him, it could kill him.

961
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:30,272
Or something worse.

962
01:10:30,935 --> 01:10:32,061
I know.

963
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:34,780
This is the maintenance closet,
Gwen.

964
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:38,193
This is the most clichéd
hiding place you could've chosen.

965
01:10:38,443 --> 01:10:40,411
This is the stupidest hiding place.
I'm sorry,

966
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:44,624
I didn't take us to the Bahamas
of hiding places.

967
01:10:44,866 --> 01:10:48,621
I gotta talk to you about England,
I guess, because I don't...

968
01:10:58,337 --> 01:11:01,432
You just kissed me.
I know, I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.

969
01:11:02,383 --> 01:11:03,475
How'd you like it?

970
01:11:03,968 --> 01:11:05,311
It felt a little bit rushed.

971
01:11:05,553 --> 01:11:07,681
I know. I know, I know.

972
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:11,689
This is the plan. You get to the elevator.
I'm gonna distract him, okay?

973
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:12,810
Okay.

974
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,498
Ooh! God! Damn it!
I'm so...

975
01:11:29,744 --> 01:11:32,964
I just spilled a hot latte all over your...
I didn't mean to do that. Oh, no!

976
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:35,049
And you too? I'm sorry.

977
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:36,793
- Miss! Stay right there!
- Sir.

978
01:11:37,043 --> 01:11:39,296
Just stay right...
Wait, wait, wait.

979
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:40,546
Hey! Stop!

980
01:11:43,007 --> 01:11:44,087
All right. On your way.
Aah.

981
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:46,511
I'm sorry. I'm all thumbs today.

982
01:11:51,349 --> 01:11:53,477
Gwen Stacy. Ha, ha.
Oh, my God.

983
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:55,732
Sorry.
Sorry.

984
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:57,321
No, it's okay.

985
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:00,491
Uh, I'm... I'm Harry.

986
01:12:01,067 --> 01:12:02,193
Yeah.

987
01:12:02,902 --> 01:12:06,577
I'm an old friend of Peter's.
Yeah, I know who you are. Sorry.

988
01:12:06,823 --> 01:12:08,450
I was kind of rushing.

989
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:11,122
No, I'm sorry
he never introduced us.

990
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:13,463
I thought you two had broken up.

991
01:12:14,205 --> 01:12:15,331
Oh.

992
01:12:16,249 --> 01:12:18,672
Yeah. Yes, we had.

993
01:12:18,918 --> 01:12:20,465
And it's...

994
01:12:20,711 --> 01:12:22,588
It's complicated.
Complicated. Yeah.

995
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:26,059
I mean, it's Peter. Heh. Everything's
always complicated with Peter.

996
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:27,301
Yeah.

997
01:12:27,844 --> 01:12:29,096
Yeah.

998
01:12:29,804 --> 01:12:31,272
Yeah, you're right.

999
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:33,566
But that's why he needs you.

1000
01:12:35,268 --> 01:12:36,440
Right?

1001
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:41,107
To help him make his choices clear.

1002
01:12:44,944 --> 01:12:45,945
Nice to meet you, Harry.

1003
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:49,199
Yeah, it's such a pleasure,
Gwen.

1004
01:13:45,046 --> 01:13:48,141
You've been in a terrible accident.

1005
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:51,393
I'm Dr. Kafka.

1006
01:13:52,053 --> 01:13:53,976
I'm here to help you.

1007
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:55,940
Course you are, doc.

1008
01:13:56,974 --> 01:14:01,070
That's why you're preparing
military-grade biostim electrodes.

1009
01:14:01,771 --> 01:14:03,648
High-intensity capacitors.

1010
01:14:04,607 --> 01:14:06,109
The kind they make at Oscorp.

1011
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:09,286
All of this
because you're trying to help me.

1012
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:10,700
You are correct.

1013
01:14:11,072 --> 01:14:13,040
I'm here to study you.

1014
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:17,958
To understand what you are,
why you are.

1015
01:14:18,204 --> 01:14:20,081
<i>Und</i> I will get results.

1016
01:14:25,628 --> 01:14:26,675
I always do.

1017
01:14:29,757 --> 01:14:31,475
You do realize

1018
01:14:31,968 --> 01:14:33,891
you looked me in a prison

1019
01:14:34,428 --> 01:14:35,725
that runs

1020
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:37,811
on electricity?

1021
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:42,941
MM. I can feel it in the walls.

1022
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:45,106
I can feel it in my veins.

1023
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:48,656
No matter what you do, doc,
you can't contain it.

1024
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:51,244
It's a force of nature.

1025
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:53,906
Like me.

1026
01:15:01,372 --> 01:15:02,874
You wanna know how powerful I am?

1027
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:05,376
Well, so do I.

1028
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:06,673
Ooh!

1029
01:15:10,798 --> 01:15:13,176
I'm dying to know,

1030
01:15:13,884 --> 01:15:15,010
doc.

1031
01:15:15,845 --> 01:15:18,769
But you better make damn sure
you kill me this time.

1032
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:20,517
Because if you don't,

1033
01:15:21,142 --> 01:15:23,190
I'm gonna kill the light.

1034
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:27,907
<i>So everyone in this city is gonna know
how it feels to live in my world.</i>

1035
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:30,618
<i>A world without power.</i>

1036
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:33,238
A world without mercy.

1037
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:35,031
A world

1038
01:15:35,281 --> 01:15:36,908
without Spider-Man.

1039
01:15:37,408 --> 01:15:41,709
And everyone will be able to see me
for who I truly am.

1040
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:44,373
And who are you?

1041
01:15:44,915 --> 01:15:46,383
Don't you know?

1042
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:48,260
I'm Electro.

1043
01:15:53,632 --> 01:15:56,806
<i>Warning: Electrical
restraint capacity reached.</i>

1044
01:15:57,053 --> 01:15:59,806
<i>Initiate lockdown procedure
immediately.</i>

1045
01:16:00,056 --> 01:16:01,683
Very impressive,

1046
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:04,314
Electro.

1047
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:06,938
<i>Lockdown initiated.</i>

1048
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:19,955
Aunt May?

1049
01:16:19,956 --> 01:16:21,167
Aunt May?

1050
01:16:26,624 --> 01:16:27,921
What are you doing?

1051
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:29,797
When did you do this?

1052
01:16:39,303 --> 01:16:41,931
There's something
you're not telling me, Aunt May.

1053
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:45,185
Every time I mention my parents,
your eyes go down.

1054
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:48,734
I know you're not telling me something.
You lie to me. I know you love me.

1055
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:50,822
I don't lie.
I know you love me, but you do.

1056
01:16:51,065 --> 01:16:52,442
Aunt May, Aunt May.

1057
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:55,240
You have to tell me, May.

1058
01:16:56,237 --> 01:16:57,454
That's my father.

1059
01:16:57,696 --> 01:16:59,118
Yes, he was your father.

1060
01:16:59,365 --> 01:17:01,993
But that didn't seem to stop him
from leaving you...

1061
01:17:02,701 --> 01:17:03,873
here.

1062
01:17:05,538 --> 01:17:07,006
I need the truth.

1063
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:11,802
The truth is, your parents
left you here, on our doorstep.

1064
01:17:12,044 --> 01:17:13,796
You were this little boy
whose whole world

1065
01:17:14,046 --> 01:17:16,765
was turned upside down
with no explanation.

1066
01:17:17,007 --> 01:17:21,763
We did the best we could,
your Uncle Ben and I.

1067
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:25,604
I mean, who else was gonna care for you,
and protect you and worry about you?

1068
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:27,102
Your father?

1069
01:17:27,434 --> 01:17:28,526
No.

1070
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:32,899
I was the one who wiped your nose,
and made you brush your teeth,

1071
01:17:33,149 --> 01:17:35,823
and do your homework,
or washed your dirty underwear. Me!

1072
01:17:36,193 --> 01:17:40,790
Your stupid, non-scientific aunt, who
doesn't know how to make ends meet,

1073
01:17:41,031 --> 01:17:42,658
who has to take nursing classes

1074
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:45,787
with 22-year-old kids so I can
pay for you to go to college.

1075
01:17:46,036 --> 01:17:48,130
And I don't know how to do this
without Ben.

1076
01:17:48,372 --> 01:17:49,498
I don't know how. And...

1077
01:17:50,291 --> 01:17:53,465
And you're dreaming about
your perfect father,

1078
01:17:53,711 --> 01:17:56,385
who was never here. No.

1079
01:17:57,548 --> 01:17:59,095
No, I won't tell you.

1080
01:17:59,383 --> 01:18:00,475
You're my boy.

1081
01:18:00,718 --> 01:18:03,062
As far as I'm concerned,
you're my boy.

1082
01:18:03,304 --> 01:18:04,396
And I won't hurt you.

1083
01:18:14,023 --> 01:18:15,741
I'm your boy.

1084
01:18:16,192 --> 01:18:17,739
You're my everything.

1085
01:18:19,069 --> 01:18:22,448
You're enough.
You're more than enough.

1086
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:25,121
That's not what this is about.
Don't get that twisted.

1087
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:28,996
I love you so much.
I know.

1088
01:18:33,876 --> 01:18:35,219
It's okay.

1089
01:18:36,587 --> 01:18:37,679
It's okay.

1090
01:18:40,633 --> 01:18:41,805
May.

1091
01:18:44,929 --> 01:18:47,102
I need to know.

1092
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:52,944
All right.

1093
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:58,408
I'll tell you everything I know.

1094
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:02,871
But it will hurt you.

1095
01:19:03,948 --> 01:19:05,074
Okay.

1096
01:19:07,785 --> 01:19:10,208
A few days after the funeral,

1097
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:14,209
two government men
came to see us.

1098
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:19,172
<i>They said the genetics research</i>

1099
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:22,891
<i>that your father was doing with
Norman Osborn was very valuable,</i>

1100
01:19:23,133 --> 01:19:25,761
<i>and that people
would pay a lot for it.</i>

1101
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:28,013
<i>And that's why he ran off with it.</i>

1102
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:29,982
<i>They said he was a traitor.</i>

1103
01:19:30,224 --> 01:19:31,976
I couldn't believe it, Peter.

1104
01:19:32,309 --> 01:19:35,153
They told us he betrayed
his best friend, all of us,

1105
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:36,864
for the money.

1106
01:19:38,148 --> 01:19:39,240
I don't...

1107
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:44,097
Oh, I don't get it. No, I don't...
This doesn't make sense.

1108
01:19:44,321 --> 01:19:47,951
Yes, I know. I know. I didn't
believe it either. I didn't believe it.

1109
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:49,452
It doesn't make any sense.

1110
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:50,919
Peter, I don't know.

1111
01:19:51,328 --> 01:19:54,377
For so long, I would play it over
and over and over in my head.

1112
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,876
What had I missed?
What had I missed?

1113
01:19:57,126 --> 01:19:59,629
He was just this
normal, unassuming guy.

1114
01:19:59,878 --> 01:20:02,973
He wore the same ratty lab coat
for 20 years.

1115
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:05,889
He took the D train to work
at 7 every morning.

1116
01:20:06,135 --> 01:20:08,308
Came home at 6 every night.

1117
01:20:09,388 --> 01:20:10,890
I don't know.

1118
01:20:11,432 --> 01:20:14,686
Maybe everyone has
a part of themselves they hide.

1119
01:20:15,978 --> 01:20:18,231
Even from the people they love.

1120
01:20:24,528 --> 01:20:25,620
Peter.

1121
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:30,159
Peter.

1122
01:20:34,204 --> 01:20:35,706
Mr. Osborn.

1123
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:41,886
Look up.

1124
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:44,635
Think you're looking for me.

1125
01:20:47,384 --> 01:20:49,557
I cannot believe my eyes.

1126
01:20:51,305 --> 01:20:52,602
Spider-Man.

1127
01:20:59,897 --> 01:21:01,899
Just the man I wanted to see.

1128
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:06,036
You, um...

1129
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:08,951
talked to Peter?

1130
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:10,912
Yeah.

1131
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:20,213
I wanna help you, Mr. Osborn.
I really, really do.

1132
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:24,923
I can't give you my blood.
Not right now.

1133
01:21:25,172 --> 01:21:26,298
Excuse me?

1134
01:21:27,257 --> 01:21:29,009
It's too dangerous.

1135
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,263
If our blood is incompatible,
you could die.

1136
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:35,520
I'm already dying.

1137
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:39,273
Your blood can't make me die more.

1138
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,272
But it could do something worse.

1139
01:21:44,024 --> 01:21:45,196
Okay.

1140
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:48,575
All right, how much?

1141
01:21:48,821 --> 01:21:51,119
How much what?
How much do you want? Name it.

1142
01:21:51,365 --> 01:21:55,336
You want a boat? You want a plane? You
want money? How much do you want?

1143
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:58,831
I don't want your money.
Come on. Everybody wants my money!

1144
01:21:59,665 --> 01:22:00,666
I don't.

1145
01:22:03,210 --> 01:22:04,382
I thought you...

1146
01:22:05,212 --> 01:22:07,556
I thought you were
supposed to save people.

1147
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:12,265
I thought that's what you do,
is you save people's lives.

1148
01:22:12,511 --> 01:22:14,809
You're... You're just gonna
let me die.

1149
01:22:15,055 --> 01:22:18,275
I'm trying to protect you right now.
No. No, you are not.

1150
01:22:18,517 --> 01:22:20,940
You're trying to protect yourself.

1151
01:22:21,478 --> 01:22:25,733
Look, we just need
a bit more time

1152
01:22:25,983 --> 01:22:27,903
to figure out something else.
I do not have time!

1153
01:22:35,492 --> 01:22:36,584
I'm sorry.

1154
01:22:45,711 --> 01:22:49,090
You're a fraud, Spider-Man!
Unh!

1155
01:23:02,686 --> 01:23:04,438
Unh! Hey! Hi.
Hi.

1156
01:23:04,688 --> 01:23:07,612
Hi, I gotta talk to you for a second.
I'm running late right now.

1157
01:23:07,858 --> 01:23:10,452
It's just gonna take a second.
I can't. I'm sorry, Peter.

1158
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:13,994
Just give me one minute. I just
wanna say one thing and I'm gone.

1159
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:16,239
Everything's a mess. Everything's insane.
Shh. Shh.

1160
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:18,669
My dad, my mom.
Everything I thought about them? Lies.

1161
01:23:18,911 --> 01:23:21,835
Ha! Lies. Lies, lies, lies.
Nothing makes any sense anymore.

1162
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:23,960
I gotta figure out
what I'm gonna do with Harry.

1163
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:25,634
Of course I wanna save him.
You know?

1164
01:23:25,876 --> 01:23:27,516
I wanna save him
because he's my best pal.

1165
01:23:27,753 --> 01:23:30,597
And what if my blood works?
But what if it doesn't?

1166
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:32,307
I don't know. I got no idea.

1167
01:23:34,218 --> 01:23:36,846
Oh, God.
I got nothing. I got nothing.

1168
01:23:37,095 --> 01:23:39,814
The only thing I keep
coming back to, Gwen, is...

1169
01:23:41,475 --> 01:23:42,647
Ms. Stacy?

1170
01:23:43,268 --> 01:23:44,440
Shall I take you upstairs?

1171
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:47,064
Yes. I'm so sorry.

1172
01:23:47,314 --> 01:23:51,490
I'm so sorry. I'm already late.
Can I have just one more minute?

1173
01:23:51,735 --> 01:23:53,533
- Okay.
- Thank you. I'm sorry.

1174
01:23:54,988 --> 01:23:56,956
I'm... Ahem. Okay. I have to be...
Where are we?

1175
01:23:57,199 --> 01:23:58,576
I'm at my...

1176
01:23:59,326 --> 01:24:02,000
last interview for Oxford
right now.

1177
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:05,332
Oxford. I didn't know.
Yeah.

1178
01:24:05,582 --> 01:24:07,801
Oh. Okay, well...

1179
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:10,546
I'm sorry to bother you, uh,

1180
01:24:10,796 --> 01:24:12,389
my fair lady... Madam.

1181
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:14,383
But who am I?

1182
01:24:14,633 --> 01:24:16,180
I mean, who am I?
I'm John Hopkins.

1183
01:24:16,426 --> 01:24:18,474
I'm one of the young
professors at Harvard,

1184
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:21,690
and I've been trying to
get her to be in my...

1185
01:24:22,349 --> 01:24:24,647
Be a part of my team
for a while now.

1186
01:24:24,893 --> 01:24:27,817
And she's just the best person
I know and a scientific genius.

1187
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:29,064
And...

1188
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:30,736
Anyway, God save the queen.

1189
01:24:30,983 --> 01:24:32,781
- I'm sorry everything's happening...
- Can you wait?

1190
01:24:33,026 --> 01:24:34,528
Peter. Peter.

1191
01:24:34,778 --> 01:24:36,371
What do you want to say to me?

1192
01:24:37,197 --> 01:24:38,665
What's the "one thing"?

1193
01:24:42,744 --> 01:24:44,587
I have to go to England, Peter.

1194
01:24:46,582 --> 01:24:47,959
It's important to me.

1195
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:55,967
I mean, I don't know. Maybe
we're on different paths right now.

1196
01:24:56,633 --> 01:24:58,727
You know? I don't know.

1197
01:24:58,969 --> 01:25:00,312
Maybe we're just

1198
01:25:00,846 --> 01:25:02,348
going different ways. I don't...

1199
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:04,692
I've gotta go. I gotta go.

1200
01:25:08,103 --> 01:25:08,820
Gwen.

1201
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:13,112
Good luck.

1202
01:25:16,653 --> 01:25:18,906
Hi. Sorry.

1210
01:26:58,338 --> 01:26:59,635
Mr. Osborn?

1211
01:27:01,466 --> 01:27:02,513
You all right?

1212
01:27:02,759 --> 01:27:05,262
Is there anything I can get you?

1213
01:27:05,512 --> 01:27:08,516
No, not unless you can
bring those spiders back to life.

1214
01:27:09,182 --> 01:27:10,229
Spiders?

1215
01:27:10,475 --> 01:27:12,443
The ones that they destroyed...

1216
01:27:13,603 --> 01:27:16,777
"to restore
investor confidence."

1217
01:27:18,191 --> 01:27:19,989
Go home, Felicia.

1218
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:21,532
Take the day off.

1219
01:27:23,822 --> 01:27:24,914
Harry.

1220
01:27:27,033 --> 01:27:30,833
I think there may be another way
to get what you're looking for.

1221
01:27:33,123 --> 01:27:37,469
I overheard Menken talking
with one of our security heads.

1222
01:27:38,545 --> 01:27:40,343
Before they destroyed
the spiders,

1223
01:27:41,298 --> 01:27:42,925
they had the venom extracted.

1224
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:46,724
Uh, what?

1225
01:27:49,014 --> 01:27:50,436
What are you saying?

1226
01:27:50,682 --> 01:27:52,525
That way, they could comply
with the lawsuits,

1227
01:27:52,768 --> 01:27:55,612
but still keep the data
in case it ever became useful.

1228
01:27:56,980 --> 01:27:57,981
Where is it?

1229
01:27:58,356 --> 01:28:00,154
It's somewhere in the building.

1230
01:28:01,651 --> 01:28:05,201
It's somewhere off-books
called "Special Projects."

1248
01:28:56,456 --> 01:28:57,548
What did you do?

1249
01:28:57,791 --> 01:29:00,214
The more relevant question is
what did you do?

1250
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:04,510
An employee is killed and in your
first action as CEO, you cover it up.

1251
01:29:04,756 --> 01:29:09,136
No, you covered it up. Then you buried
him in the bughouse using my name.

1252
01:29:09,386 --> 01:29:13,186
Ravencroft is a timeworn institution
devoted to mental improvement.

1253
01:29:13,431 --> 01:29:15,354
You are experimenting
on people in there.

1254
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,773
Progress has its
stepping stones.

1255
01:29:18,019 --> 01:29:20,818
Now, in light of your deceptive
criminal actions, you've been...

1256
01:29:21,064 --> 01:29:22,657
How do I put this gently?

1257
01:29:22,899 --> 01:29:23,900
...fired.

1258
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:27,283
You are not going to bury me too.

1259
01:29:27,529 --> 01:29:30,203
Looks to me like you're
halfway in the ground already.

1260
01:29:30,991 --> 01:29:32,618
It's only a matter of time.

1261
01:29:33,285 --> 01:29:35,538
You're going to die
a horrible death.

1262
01:29:35,871 --> 01:29:37,544
Like your father.

1263
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:39,753
The difference is,

1264
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:42,085
no one is going to miss you.

1265
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:46,131
Get him out.

1266
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:47,382
Wait. Wait.

1267
01:29:54,723 --> 01:29:56,396
I know my way out.

1268
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:08,670
A hundred dollars.
Can you believe that?

1269
01:30:08,904 --> 01:30:11,077
Tell you why, you should
put the lid on that but quick.

1270
01:30:11,323 --> 01:30:12,666
I tried. Good luck.

1271
01:30:12,908 --> 01:30:15,988
You should tell her to come down
here and find one of those alligators.

1272
01:32:39,929 --> 01:32:41,146
<i>Test.</i>

1273
01:32:41,765 --> 01:32:43,483
<i>My name is Richard Parker.</i>

1274
01:32:44,309 --> 01:32:45,811
<i>Whatever lies will be told about me,</i>

1275
01:32:46,061 --> 01:32:47,938
<i>I would like the world
to know the truth.</i>

1276
01:32:48,897 --> 01:32:52,151
<i>Oscorp was already a leader
in genetic research</i>

1277
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:57,247
<i>when Norman Osborn made a deal
with a foreign military organization</i>

1278
01:32:57,489 --> 01:32:59,992
<i>to continue funding my research.</i>

1279
01:33:00,241 --> 01:33:02,619
<i>And I discovered what
they were going to use it for.</i>

1280
01:33:02,952 --> 01:33:05,421
<i>Weapons. Biological weapons,
of course.</i>

1281
01:33:05,663 --> 01:33:07,006
<i>So I refused.</i>

1282
01:33:07,248 --> 01:33:10,377
<i>And now, to eliminate me
from the picture,</i>

1283
01:33:10,627 --> 01:33:14,507
<i>Norman Osborn has
falsified evidence against me</i>

1284
01:33:14,756 --> 01:33:18,260
<i>in order to take control
of my work.</i>

1285
01:33:21,763 --> 01:33:23,015
Can I help you?

1286
01:33:23,389 --> 01:33:25,562
Uh, yeah, you can open the gate.

1287
01:33:25,809 --> 01:33:27,106
I'm Harry Osborn.

1288
01:33:27,352 --> 01:33:31,357
Now, there's a patient in that
Isolation Wing that I need to see.

1289
01:33:31,606 --> 01:33:34,485
Joe, this is Mr. Osborn of Oscorp.

1290
01:33:34,734 --> 01:33:37,754
Sorry, without a yellow badge,
I can't let anyone past this point.

1291
01:33:41,032 --> 01:33:43,455
<i>But it doesn't matter because
there's something else...</i>

1292
01:33:44,494 --> 01:33:46,292
<i>that Norman doesn't know.</i>

1293
01:33:47,789 --> 01:33:49,507
<i>The human DNA</i>

1294
01:33:50,083 --> 01:33:52,632
<i>that I implanted in the spiders...</i>

1295
01:33:54,504 --> 01:33:55,630
<i>was my own.</i>

1296
01:33:58,133 --> 01:34:00,431
<i>Which means that without me,</i>

1297
01:34:00,677 --> 01:34:02,350
<i>without my bloodline,</i>

1298
01:34:03,012 --> 01:34:07,233
<i>Oscorp can never replicate
or continue my experiments.</i>

1299
01:34:07,642 --> 01:34:10,020
Keep Electro incubated

1300
01:34:10,270 --> 01:34:14,446
with 400 milligrams of sodium
thiopental <i>und</i> phenobarbital.

1301
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:19,075
<i>I have destroyed as much
as possible from the archives.</i>

1302
01:34:20,655 --> 01:34:22,623
<i>But I didn't have time
to kill all of the spiders.</i>

1303
01:34:22,866 --> 01:34:26,086
<i>So as a scientist,
my choice is very clear now.</i>

1304
01:34:26,327 --> 01:34:30,127
<i>I have to disappear. I have to get
as far away from here as I can.</i>

1305
01:34:30,373 --> 01:34:32,171
<i>But as a father,</i>

1306
01:34:32,542 --> 01:34:35,671
<i>it means I may not
see my boy again.</i>

1307
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:40,016
<i>And nothing is as important to me</i>

1308
01:34:40,758 --> 01:34:42,760
<i>as my son, Peter.</i>

1309
01:34:43,136 --> 01:34:44,888
<i>Nothing in this world.</i>

1310
01:34:45,513 --> 01:34:47,481
<i>But I have a responsibility</i>

1311
01:34:47,724 --> 01:34:49,772
<i>to protect the world
from what I've created,</i>

1312
01:34:50,018 --> 01:34:52,988
<i>and to protect him from
what I know Osborn is capable of.</i>

1313
01:34:53,855 --> 01:34:56,233
<i>People will say I am a monster</i>

1314
01:34:57,233 --> 01:34:58,826
<i>for what I've done.</i>

1315
01:35:00,528 --> 01:35:02,030
<i>And maybe they're right.</i>

1316
01:35:04,782 --> 01:35:06,910
<i>I always thought that I'd have more</i>

1317
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:08,252
<i>time.</i>

1318
01:35:08,494 --> 01:35:10,371
<i>Dad? Dad!</i>

1319
01:35:10,622 --> 01:35:11,919
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1320
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:32,443
<i>Sedation off.</i>

1321
01:35:33,978 --> 01:35:35,025
Psst.

1322
01:35:39,359 --> 01:35:41,361
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1323
01:35:41,778 --> 01:35:43,780
All right?
But we don't have much time.

1324
01:35:44,697 --> 01:35:45,698
Who are you?

1325
01:35:45,949 --> 01:35:49,078
I'm Harry Osborn.
I wanna make you a deal.

1326
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:52,122
I should kill you.

1327
01:35:52,372 --> 01:35:54,090
Oh, come on.

1328
01:35:54,582 --> 01:35:56,505
Think bigger, Max.

1329
01:35:56,751 --> 01:35:58,753
I'm not the one you want.

1330
01:35:59,003 --> 01:36:00,300
You want Spider-Man.

1331
01:36:01,798 --> 01:36:03,641
And I can give him to you.

1332
01:36:03,883 --> 01:36:08,559
But I need something first.

1333
01:36:09,931 --> 01:36:12,150
I need you to get me into Oscorp.

1334
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:14,022
Get you in?

1335
01:36:14,477 --> 01:36:15,569
You own it.

1336
01:36:15,812 --> 01:36:18,190
Heh. Uh, not anymore.

1337
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:19,691
Oscorp betrayed us both,

1338
01:36:19,941 --> 01:36:23,787
so I can't get in there without you and
you can't get out of here without me.

1339
01:36:24,737 --> 01:36:25,417
What's happening?

1340
01:36:25,655 --> 01:36:27,415
Someone pulled an
alarm in the Iso Unit.

1341
01:36:27,573 --> 01:36:30,122
Get a containment team
up there now.

1342
01:36:30,785 --> 01:36:32,503
You couldn't possibly know
what I want.

1343
01:36:32,745 --> 01:36:34,463
You submitted
the design for the grid,

1344
01:36:34,706 --> 01:36:36,583
and they stole it.
And now you want it back.

1345
01:36:36,833 --> 01:36:38,631
You just wanna take back
what's yours.

1346
01:36:38,876 --> 01:36:41,595
How?
It is all the power in the city, Max,

1347
01:36:41,838 --> 01:36:43,761
and it's right at your fingertips.

1348
01:36:44,007 --> 01:36:45,805
And then once you
shut down the grid,

1349
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:49,975
Spider-Man will come to you,
and I want you to make him bleed.

1350
01:36:51,931 --> 01:36:52,978
Break it! Break it!

1351
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:57,653
Max, we don't have much time!

1352
01:36:57,895 --> 01:37:00,239
Go! Go. go! Go!

1353
01:37:00,481 --> 01:37:02,529
Give me one reason
why I should trust you.

1354
01:37:02,775 --> 01:37:03,822
Because I need you!

1355
01:37:05,737 --> 01:37:06,738
You need me?

1356
01:37:06,988 --> 01:37:09,912
Yes. I need you.

1357
01:37:10,241 --> 01:37:14,291
You are my only chance
that I have at surviving.

1358
01:37:14,537 --> 01:37:15,459
You need me?

1359
01:37:15,705 --> 01:37:17,628
Yes. I need you.

1360
01:37:18,708 --> 01:37:19,880
I need you. Please! Please!

1361
01:37:21,753 --> 01:37:22,800
Please!

1362
01:37:23,129 --> 01:37:25,006
I know what it's like
to be thrown away!

1363
01:37:25,256 --> 01:37:26,257
Please, Max!

1364
01:37:26,507 --> 01:37:28,430
I need you! I need you!

1365
01:38:18,851 --> 01:38:19,852
No!

1366
01:38:23,898 --> 01:38:25,525
You wanna be my friend?

1367
01:38:26,192 --> 01:38:28,365
I thought we were already friends.

1368
01:38:29,987 --> 01:38:31,409
I had a friend once.

1369
01:38:32,490 --> 01:38:34,242
It didn't work out.

1370
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:36,456
Yeah. Me too.

1371
01:38:37,954 --> 01:38:40,048
Then let's go catch a spider.

1372
01:38:43,459 --> 01:38:45,962
<i>You have one new voice message.</i>

1373
01:38:48,256 --> 01:38:50,054
<i>Hi, Peter, it's me.</i>

1374
01:38:50,967 --> 01:38:54,597
<i>Uh, I got in to Oxford.</i>

1375
01:38:54,846 --> 01:38:59,067
<i>Woo-hoo. It's very exciting.</i>

1376
01:38:59,559 --> 01:39:02,904
<i>I came by your house
a little bit ago and I, um...</i>

1377
01:39:03,521 --> 01:39:04,568
<i>You weren't there,</i>

1378
01:39:04,814 --> 01:39:08,193
<i>and so I'm on my way
to the airport right now,</i>

1379
01:39:08,443 --> 01:39:11,117
<i>because there's this early
summer class that I found out about,</i>

1380
01:39:11,362 --> 01:39:14,457
<i>and I thought that
it would somehow</i>

1381
01:39:14,824 --> 01:39:18,829
<i>be easier, I guess, this way.</i>

1382
01:39:19,412 --> 01:39:22,837
<i>I think that maybe it's time</i>

1383
01:39:23,082 --> 01:39:25,255
<i>to let this go.</i>

1384
01:39:25,918 --> 01:39:28,216
<i>And that's not because
I don't love you.</i>

1385
01:39:28,463 --> 01:39:31,763
<i>It's actually because I do, so, um...</i>

1386
01:39:32,383 --> 01:39:33,760
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

1387
01:39:48,274 --> 01:39:50,697
We have to move, now.
Why? What's happened?

1388
01:40:03,623 --> 01:40:05,250
Remember me?

1389
01:40:09,629 --> 01:40:10,972
Oh, my, oh, my.

1390
01:40:11,214 --> 01:40:13,182
How the tables have turned.

1391
01:40:13,758 --> 01:40:16,136
I know it's hard to admit,

1392
01:40:16,385 --> 01:40:20,731
but how spectacular
a move is this?

1393
01:40:21,974 --> 01:40:24,568
Am I right?
Right as rain.

1394
01:40:26,187 --> 01:40:28,815
Okay, so, Fairy Godmother,

1395
01:40:29,065 --> 01:40:31,864
it is time to grant me a wish.

1396
01:40:32,109 --> 01:40:36,330
I want in to Special...
How dare you come back in here?

1397
01:40:37,532 --> 01:40:41,002
You recalcitrant,
unworthy, defective,

1398
01:40:41,244 --> 01:40:43,212
urchin freaks.

1399
01:40:45,790 --> 01:40:50,967
Oh, God, I'm sorry. That's just not
the answer we were looking for.

1400
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:05,647
Clear.

1401
01:41:07,478 --> 01:41:10,027
Welcome back to the bonus round.

1402
01:41:11,566 --> 01:41:14,945
Hey, let's take a walk, shall we?

1403
01:41:19,282 --> 01:41:22,081
The grid is all yours.

1404
01:41:54,358 --> 01:41:56,827
The spider venom.
Give it to me.

1405
01:42:02,825 --> 01:42:04,247
What is all this stuff?

1406
01:42:04,493 --> 01:42:05,995
The future.

1407
01:42:19,759 --> 01:42:20,976
Load one up.

1408
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:26,812
It won't work.

1409
01:42:27,058 --> 01:42:30,733
We ran every diagnostic test
apart from human trials.

1410
01:42:30,978 --> 01:42:34,949
You've actually already run human trials.
You're just too stupid to know it.

1411
01:42:38,986 --> 01:42:41,034
Do it. Now.

1412
01:43:00,675 --> 01:43:02,518
You had it all this time.

1413
01:44:32,349 --> 01:44:33,726
It's Spider-Man.

1414
01:44:39,690 --> 01:44:40,862
Stop the cab.

1415
01:44:41,108 --> 01:44:43,156
Lady, I ain't even moving.

1416
01:45:08,135 --> 01:45:08,931
Whoa!

1417
01:45:13,766 --> 01:45:15,313
- Hi.
- Hi.

1418
01:45:16,018 --> 01:45:17,995
- Did you get my message?
- What message?

1419
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:20,694
- The message right there.
- Oh, that. That was you?

1420
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:22,738
Don't do that.
I couldn't make it out.

1421
01:45:22,983 --> 01:45:25,111
I'll tell you what it says.
Says, "I love you."

1422
01:45:26,779 --> 01:45:28,497
Because I love you.

1423
01:45:29,532 --> 01:45:31,955
And no offense, but you're wrong.
I'm wrong about what?

1424
01:45:32,201 --> 01:45:34,044
You're wrong about
us being on different paths.

1425
01:45:34,286 --> 01:45:36,630
We're not on different paths.
You're my path.

1426
01:45:37,706 --> 01:45:39,879
And you're always gonna be
my path.

1427
01:45:40,835 --> 01:45:44,385
And I know there's a million reasons why
we shouldn't be together. I know that.

1428
01:45:44,713 --> 01:45:46,386
But I'm tired of them.

1429
01:45:49,009 --> 01:45:51,307
I'm tired of every single one
of them.

1430
01:45:51,804 --> 01:45:53,727
We've all gotta make a choice.

1431
01:45:55,641 --> 01:45:57,109
Right? Well, I choose you.

1432
01:45:59,728 --> 01:46:00,980
So,

1433
01:46:01,230 --> 01:46:02,777
here's my thought.

1434
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:05,743
England.

1435
01:46:07,069 --> 01:46:08,412
Both of us.

1436
01:46:10,281 --> 01:46:11,874
I'm following you now.

1437
01:46:12,408 --> 01:46:14,251
I'm just gonna
follow you everywhere.

1438
01:46:14,827 --> 01:46:16,795
I'm just gonna follow you
the rest of my life.

1439
01:46:17,955 --> 01:46:21,175
I mean, they got crime there
in England.

1440
01:46:21,417 --> 01:46:23,090
Yeah.
They got tons of crime, it seems.

1441
01:46:23,335 --> 01:46:25,258
Tons.
They got, uh,

1442
01:46:25,921 --> 01:46:28,015
Jack the Ripper.
Heh, heh.

1443
01:46:28,299 --> 01:46:29,300
What?

1444
01:46:29,550 --> 01:46:32,053
They haven't caught Jack the Ripper yet.
You didn't know that?

1445
01:46:52,156 --> 01:46:53,328
What the hell is that?

1446
01:47:03,959 --> 01:47:05,506
Is that Max?

1447
01:47:06,086 --> 01:47:08,339
He must have cut the power
to the whole city.

1448
01:47:16,931 --> 01:47:18,649
PNA 322, you are...

1449
01:47:19,016 --> 01:47:21,064
- I'm black.
- I have nothing.

1450
01:47:21,310 --> 01:47:23,654
Hey, I need Tech Ops up here
right now.

1451
01:47:23,896 --> 01:47:26,399
The phones are down. Somebody
go down and grab Tech Ops.

1452
01:47:26,774 --> 01:47:28,572
Hey, write down
what you remember, people.

1453
01:47:28,817 --> 01:47:32,572
There's gotta be some kind of blackout
plan, right? Some kind of backup?

1454
01:47:32,821 --> 01:47:35,665
There's an emergency reset
at the power plant.

1455
01:47:35,908 --> 01:47:38,752
If he cuts the transmission lines,
they're never gonna get this back up.

1456
01:47:38,994 --> 01:47:41,755
How will I stop him? Every time I get
close, he fries my web shooters.

1457
01:47:41,914 --> 01:47:43,882
Have you tried grounding them?
Tried everything.

1458
01:47:44,124 --> 01:47:46,172
Rubber, plastic...
Did you try magnetizing them?

1459
01:47:46,418 --> 01:47:48,887
I didn't try magnetizing them.

1460
01:47:49,129 --> 01:47:51,302
Okay, well, remember
8th grade science class?

1461
01:47:51,966 --> 01:47:54,594
If you magnetize a nail
with a battery...

1462
01:47:55,010 --> 01:47:56,887
It holds an electric charge.
Yes.

1463
01:47:59,264 --> 01:48:02,484
New York Approach. This is
Pan National 273 on approach.

1464
01:48:02,726 --> 01:48:04,023
How do you hear?

1465
01:48:05,020 --> 01:48:06,363
Approach, do you copy?

1466
01:48:06,605 --> 01:48:08,573
Radio's working. It's not us.

1467
01:48:15,489 --> 01:48:20,165
Do not panic.
Everyone, please return to your vehicles.

1468
01:48:20,411 --> 01:48:22,288
Go back to your cars.

1469
01:48:22,746 --> 01:48:23,963
Remain calm.

1470
01:48:25,416 --> 01:48:28,010
Do not panic.
Everyone return to your vehicles.

1471
01:48:28,252 --> 01:48:29,720
Go into your homes.
Officer!

1472
01:48:30,129 --> 01:48:31,255
Spider-Man!
Oh!

1473
01:48:31,505 --> 01:48:33,758
My father was Captain George Stacy
of the 19th Precinct.

1474
01:48:34,008 --> 01:48:36,761
I knew who he was. What can we do?
Jumper cables.

1475
01:48:37,011 --> 01:48:39,139
- Jumper cables?
- Yes. And copper wire.

1476
01:48:39,388 --> 01:48:41,811
Am I talking louder
than I usually talk right now?!

1477
01:48:42,558 --> 01:48:44,060
Yes.
Ho.

1478
01:48:44,393 --> 01:48:46,753
- Your suit'll ground you.
- All right, do it.

1479
01:48:49,815 --> 01:48:52,694
Okay, good. Try, try, try.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1480
01:48:52,943 --> 01:48:53,944
Okay, it works, good.

1481
01:48:54,194 --> 01:48:55,874
That is why you were
number two at Midtown.

1482
01:48:56,113 --> 01:48:56,913
Rub it in. Okay.
Heh.

1483
01:48:59,366 --> 01:49:00,959
I gotta go.
I'm coming with you.

1484
01:49:01,201 --> 01:49:03,044
You're not coming with me.
Yes, I am.

1485
01:49:03,287 --> 01:49:04,539
It's too dangerous.
I'm coming.

1486
01:49:04,788 --> 01:49:07,211
I've seen the grid specs
and I know how to reset the system.

1487
01:49:07,458 --> 01:49:11,429
I'm coming with you! You need me!
Okay, shut up. You're coming with me!

1488
01:49:11,670 --> 01:49:12,922
Shut the thing.

1489
01:49:13,297 --> 01:49:15,049
Sorry. I love you. Don't hate me.

1490
01:49:16,842 --> 01:49:18,185
Peter!

1491
01:49:18,427 --> 01:49:20,270
We still don't have
backup generators.

1492
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:21,889
Get me Engineering!

1493
01:49:22,264 --> 01:49:23,464
I need a respirator right now.

1494
01:49:23,682 --> 01:49:25,525
They're battery-operated. I'll get it.

1495
01:49:25,768 --> 01:49:26,940
Hang on.

1496
01:49:27,686 --> 01:49:28,733
Okay.

1497
01:49:51,543 --> 01:49:53,796
<i>Do you see me now, Spider-Man?</i>

1498
01:49:54,088 --> 01:49:57,342
<i>It's time to meet our destiny.</i>

1499
01:50:12,481 --> 01:50:14,921
Tower, we're experiencing
some kind of electrical disturbance.

1500
01:50:15,150 --> 01:50:17,653
Instruments are going haywire.
Radar is down.

1501
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:20,331
We're flying blind out here.
Do you copy?

1502
01:50:24,952 --> 01:50:27,375
Tower, repeat: We are standby only.
What is happening?

1503
01:50:27,621 --> 01:50:30,875
Sir? There are two inbound flights
on intersecting paths.

1504
01:50:31,125 --> 01:50:32,843
Time to impact?
Four and a half minutes.

1505
01:50:33,085 --> 01:50:34,211
Clock it right now.

1506
01:50:48,183 --> 01:50:50,356
You're too late, Spider-Man.

1507
01:50:50,686 --> 01:50:52,359
I designed this power grid.

1508
01:50:52,604 --> 01:50:54,197
Now I'm gonna take back

1509
01:50:54,439 --> 01:50:56,157
what is rightfully mine.

1510
01:50:56,525 --> 01:50:58,698
I will control everything.

1511
01:50:58,944 --> 01:51:02,574
And I will be like a god to them.

1512
01:51:02,823 --> 01:51:04,120
A god named Sparkles?

1513
01:51:14,459 --> 01:51:15,756
Not this time.

1514
01:51:16,128 --> 01:51:17,846
Is that all you got?
Come on!

1515
01:51:37,691 --> 01:51:38,863
Come on!

1516
01:51:43,113 --> 01:51:44,285
You ready to give up?

1517
01:51:54,958 --> 01:51:57,461
Oh, thank you, Gwen Stacy.

1518
01:52:08,180 --> 01:52:09,807
Just shake it off.
It's just your bones,

1519
01:52:10,057 --> 01:52:12,936
and your muscles and your organs.
Hunh!

1520
01:52:15,854 --> 01:52:17,322
Oh, boy.

1521
01:52:24,696 --> 01:52:25,697
I hate this song!

1522
01:52:46,677 --> 01:52:47,678
Spider-Man,

1523
01:52:48,095 --> 01:52:49,438
bet you never saw this coming.

1524
01:52:57,104 --> 01:52:58,902
Really? You web me to a car?

1525
01:52:59,231 --> 01:53:00,528
What are you, a caveman?

1526
01:53:00,774 --> 01:53:01,991
You shouldn't be here.

1527
01:53:02,234 --> 01:53:04,828
You tie me up to go off to war?
I know how to help you!

1528
01:53:05,070 --> 01:53:07,198
What are you doing here?!
I know the grid specs.

1529
01:53:07,447 --> 01:53:08,744
I can reset the system!

1530
01:53:08,991 --> 01:53:11,210
You can't be here right now.
I'm not messing around.

1531
01:53:11,451 --> 01:53:13,171
You can't be here right now.
This is insane.

1532
01:53:13,412 --> 01:53:16,382
Nobody makes my decisions
for me. All right? Nobody.

1533
01:53:16,623 --> 01:53:18,671
This is my choice, okay?

1534
01:53:19,376 --> 01:53:21,799
My choice. This is mine.
Oh!

1535
01:53:22,087 --> 01:53:24,260
Now, how do we stop him?
Okay, so he's electric,

1536
01:53:24,506 --> 01:53:25,974
he's like a battery.

1537
01:53:26,216 --> 01:53:27,889
What happens
if you overcharge a battery?

1538
01:53:28,135 --> 01:53:29,136
It explodes.
Right.

1539
01:53:29,386 --> 01:53:30,986
So we use his power
against him. Perfect.

1540
01:53:31,221 --> 01:53:33,064
Okay.
I think I can reconnect the power lines.

1541
01:53:33,307 --> 01:53:34,775
But I need you to reset
the system.

1542
01:53:35,058 --> 01:53:37,902
Okay, when I say you turn
that power on, you turn it on.

1543
01:53:38,145 --> 01:53:40,443
No matter what. No matter what.
Peter.

1544
01:53:45,485 --> 01:53:46,828
Go, go!

1545
01:54:38,872 --> 01:54:40,920
Sixty seconds to impact.

1546
01:55:06,274 --> 01:55:07,275
Aah!

1547
01:55:15,534 --> 01:55:16,535
Now, Gwen, now!

1548
01:55:16,785 --> 01:55:17,911
Do it now!

1549
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:44,692
Uni 687...

1550
01:55:55,824 --> 01:55:58,623
This is LaGuardia Tower.
Turn immediately to heading 280.

1551
01:55:59,327 --> 01:56:02,331
You have incoming traffic.
I repeat: 280.

1552
01:56:02,581 --> 01:56:03,878
<i>Defend immediately.</i>

1553
01:56:14,593 --> 01:56:15,936
Whoo!

1554
01:56:19,389 --> 01:56:20,390
Yes!

1555
01:56:21,016 --> 01:56:23,256
All right, people, back to work.
Let's land these planes.

1556
01:56:23,477 --> 01:56:24,854
I'll be back in a minute.

1557
01:56:25,395 --> 01:56:27,648
Oh, thank God. All right!

1558
01:56:27,898 --> 01:56:29,900
All right, we're back.
Everyone, let's go.

1559
01:57:05,936 --> 01:57:07,734
I think we can still make your flight.

1560
01:57:16,571 --> 01:57:17,697
Gwen, stay there.

1561
01:57:43,765 --> 01:57:45,187
Peter.

1562
01:57:46,101 --> 01:57:49,275
When you said Spider-Man
said no,

1563
01:57:49,771 --> 01:57:53,821
you meant you said no.

1564
01:57:54,067 --> 01:57:56,490
Harry, what did you do?

1565
01:57:56,736 --> 01:57:58,738
What you made me do.

1566
01:57:59,281 --> 01:58:00,783
You were my friend

1567
01:58:01,032 --> 01:58:03,581
and you betrayed me!

1568
01:58:03,868 --> 01:58:04,994
No.

1569
01:58:05,453 --> 01:58:07,376
I was trying to protect you.
Oh.

1570
01:58:08,123 --> 01:58:09,375
Look at me.

1571
01:58:09,624 --> 01:58:11,718
Hey, it's gonna be okay.
This is gonna be all right.

1572
01:58:12,127 --> 01:58:13,767
You don't give people hope.

1573
01:58:14,087 --> 01:58:15,634
You take it away.

1574
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:16,927
No, Harry.

1575
01:58:17,507 --> 01:58:19,475
I'm gonna take away yours.

1576
01:58:19,718 --> 01:58:21,265
- No. Gwen, run!
- Aah!

1577
01:58:21,511 --> 01:58:22,683
Harry!

1578
01:58:23,305 --> 01:58:24,602
Harry, put her down!

1579
01:58:41,531 --> 01:58:43,374
Harry, stop this right now!

1580
01:58:43,617 --> 01:58:46,336
This isn't you, Harry. This is not you.
Harry, put her down.

1581
01:58:46,911 --> 01:58:48,834
Harry.
Harry is dead!

1582
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:52,050
Harry, this is between you and me.
You wanna fight?

1583
01:58:52,292 --> 01:58:54,340
Fight me! Let her go!

1584
01:58:54,878 --> 01:58:56,004
Okay.

1585
01:58:57,213 --> 01:58:57,839
No!

1586
01:59:06,139 --> 01:59:08,392
You okay?
MM-mm.

1587
01:59:12,854 --> 01:59:14,982
I got you, Gwen. I'm gonna
put you down right here.

1588
02:00:35,228 --> 02:00:36,150
Peter?

1589
02:01:39,876 --> 02:01:42,095
Hey. Hey.

1590
02:01:45,340 --> 02:01:46,387
Gwen?

1591
02:01:49,052 --> 02:01:50,053
Hey.

1592
02:01:50,428 --> 02:01:51,554
Hey!

1593
02:01:56,392 --> 02:01:57,484
Gwen?

1594
02:01:59,521 --> 02:02:00,522
Hey.

1595
02:02:04,067 --> 02:02:05,114
Breathe.

1596
02:02:06,653 --> 02:02:08,576
Hey, Gwen.

1597
02:02:09,572 --> 02:02:10,573
Hey.

1598
02:02:14,327 --> 02:02:15,374
Hey.

1599
02:02:17,789 --> 02:02:19,086
You're okay.

1600
02:02:22,836 --> 02:02:23,928
Gwen?

1601
02:02:29,843 --> 02:02:31,345
Stay with me, stay with me.

1602
02:02:31,594 --> 02:02:33,972
Stay with me, stay with me.
You stay with me.

1603
02:02:39,727 --> 02:02:40,819
Gwen.

1604
02:02:43,523 --> 02:02:44,570
Gwen!

1605
02:02:47,569 --> 02:02:50,118
No, please, please.

1606
02:02:52,657 --> 02:02:54,034
Please.

1607
02:03:00,915 --> 02:03:03,168
I can't do this without you.

1608
02:05:05,832 --> 02:05:07,254
Leave us.

1609
02:05:11,546 --> 02:05:13,139
You've made progress.

1610
02:05:13,381 --> 02:05:16,601
I've identified several
worthy candidates.

1611
02:05:16,843 --> 02:05:18,937
Now that Spider-Man's gone,

1612
02:05:19,178 --> 02:05:22,227
this city will never be the same.

1613
02:05:22,473 --> 02:05:25,022
Oh, I'm counting on that.

1614
02:05:25,268 --> 02:05:26,861
Speaking of progress,

1615
02:05:27,103 --> 02:05:28,150
you're looking better.

1616
02:05:29,105 --> 02:05:30,948
It comes and goes.

1617
02:05:32,650 --> 02:05:34,118
Tell me more.

1618
02:05:34,694 --> 02:05:36,241
How many men
did you have in mind?

1619
02:05:36,487 --> 02:05:38,489
I wanna keep it small.

1620
02:05:38,740 --> 02:05:42,119
Everything you need
is already at Oscorp.

1621
02:05:44,078 --> 02:05:45,580
<i>Access granted.</i>

1622
02:05:45,830 --> 02:05:47,753
<i>Welcome, Mr. Fiers.</i>

1623
02:05:48,041 --> 02:05:49,759
<i>Who's our first volunteer?</i>

1624
02:05:50,001 --> 02:05:51,799
<i>Aleksei Sytsevich.</i>

1625
02:05:52,045 --> 02:05:54,218
<i>Currently serving a life sentence.</i>

1626
02:05:54,464 --> 02:05:55,681
<i>He is</i>

1627
02:05:55,923 --> 02:05:58,176
<i>most eager to join us.</i>

1628
02:05:59,010 --> 02:06:00,307
<i>Good.</i>

1629
02:06:00,970 --> 02:06:02,972
<i>Start with him.</i>

1630
02:06:03,473 --> 02:06:05,020
<i>Russian gangster Aleksei Sytsevich</i>

1631
02:06:05,266 --> 02:06:07,189
<i>was broken out of
a classified penitentiary</i>

1632
02:06:07,435 --> 02:06:10,609
<i>known simply as the Vault
by an unknown team of men.</i>

1633
02:06:10,855 --> 02:06:13,278
<i>It's yet another example
of increased criminal activity</i>

1634
02:06:13,524 --> 02:06:16,698
<i>since the disappearance
of Spider-Man five months ago.</i>

1635
02:06:16,944 --> 02:06:20,198
<i>The web-slinger's absence has left
a hole in the heart of the city.</i>

1636
02:06:20,448 --> 02:06:23,042
<i>Believe it or not, even the New
York City Police Department</i>

1637
02:06:23,284 --> 02:06:25,286
<i>has joined the chorus
of New Yorkers in hoping</i>

1638
02:06:25,536 --> 02:06:27,630
<i>for the return
of the web-slinger.</i>

1639
02:06:27,872 --> 02:06:30,045
<i>The entire world seems to be
asking the same question:</i>

1640
02:06:30,708 --> 02:06:32,085
<i>Where is Spider-Man?</i>

1641
02:06:34,087 --> 02:06:36,510
Oh. Too bad about that spider guy.

1642
02:06:38,049 --> 02:06:40,928
Too bad he's disappeared. Seems
like everybody really needs him.

1643
02:06:42,929 --> 02:06:44,226
Where you going?

1644
02:06:45,431 --> 02:06:48,105
Eat my cereal.
Peter.

1645
02:06:48,518 --> 02:06:50,191
Where you going?

1646
02:07:00,154 --> 02:07:01,201
I don't know.

1647
02:07:03,491 --> 02:07:05,164
You know, it's so funny.
I've been...

1648
02:07:05,910 --> 02:07:08,754
I've been trying to clean up
around here, get organized,

1649
02:07:09,163 --> 02:07:13,384
and been putting
some of Ben's stuff in boxes.

1650
02:07:14,168 --> 02:07:17,889
And it's so funny, the heavier
the box gets, the lighter I feel.

1651
02:07:18,631 --> 02:07:20,679
You're throwing his stuff away?
No.

1652
02:07:20,925 --> 02:07:22,142
No. God, no.

1653
02:07:22,510 --> 02:07:25,639
I couldn't do that. It's part of me.

1654
02:07:26,514 --> 02:07:29,484
I'm just finding

1655
02:07:30,434 --> 02:07:31,902
a better place for it.

1656
02:07:35,648 --> 02:07:37,571
I'm gonna take one last look,

1657
02:07:39,026 --> 02:07:40,653
and I'm gonna put it
where it belongs.

1658
02:08:05,928 --> 02:08:10,149
<i>It's easy to feel
hopeful on a beautiful day like today.</i>

1659
02:08:11,350 --> 02:08:14,229
<i>But there will be dark days
ahead of us too.</i>

1660
02:08:15,062 --> 02:08:17,611
<i>There will be days
where you feel all alone.</i>

1661
02:08:20,151 --> 02:08:22,574
<i>And that's when hope
is needed most.</i>

1662
02:08:24,030 --> 02:08:26,078
<i>No matter how buried it gets,</i>

1663
02:08:26,908 --> 02:08:29,002
<i>or how lost you feel,</i>

1664
02:08:29,243 --> 02:08:30,961
<i>you must promise me</i>

1665
02:08:31,204 --> 02:08:34,549
<i>that you will hold on to hope.</i>

1666
02:08:36,250 --> 02:08:37,502
<i>Keep it alive.</i>

1667
02:08:38,419 --> 02:08:41,047
<i>We have to be greater
than what we suffer.</i>

1668
02:08:41,297 --> 02:08:42,765
<i>My wish for you</i>

1669
02:08:43,007 --> 02:08:45,135
<i>is to become hope.</i>

1670
02:08:45,593 --> 02:08:47,061
<i>People need that.</i>

1671
02:08:48,387 --> 02:08:50,355
<i>And even if we fail,</i>

1672
02:08:50,723 --> 02:08:52,771
<i>what better way is there to live?</i>

1673
02:08:54,352 --> 02:08:56,104
<i>As we look around here today</i>

1674
02:08:56,479 --> 02:08:59,699
<i>at all of the people
who helped make us who we are,</i>

1675
02:09:00,399 --> 02:09:02,822
<i>I know it feels like
we're saying goodbye.</i>

1676
02:09:03,361 --> 02:09:06,035
<i>But we will carry
a piece of each other</i>

1677
02:09:06,280 --> 02:09:09,033
<i>into everything that we do next,</i>

1678
02:09:10,701 --> 02:09:13,705
<i>to remind us of who we are,</i>

1679
02:09:15,581 --> 02:09:17,208
<i>and of who we're meant to be.</i>

1680
02:09:19,669 --> 02:09:21,842
<i>I've had a great four years with you.</i>

1681
02:09:22,088 --> 02:09:24,090
<i>I'll miss you all very much.</i>

1682
02:09:39,397 --> 02:09:40,398
Whoa!

1683
02:09:46,487 --> 02:09:47,579
Let's go! Move it.

1684
02:09:55,955 --> 02:09:57,423
Get down! Take cover!

1685
02:10:01,252 --> 02:10:05,553
<i>I'm here live on Park Avenue and
56th Street where it is complete chaos.</i>

1686
02:10:05,798 --> 02:10:08,017
<i>A man in some sort of
weaponized armored suit</i>

1687
02:10:08,259 --> 02:10:09,681
<i>is wreaking havoc on Midtown.</i>

1688
02:10:13,723 --> 02:10:16,351
I am the Rhino!

1689
02:10:16,600 --> 02:10:19,023
I told you I would be back!

1690
02:10:30,281 --> 02:10:32,409
A kid! No! No!

1691
02:10:37,621 --> 02:10:38,372
Hold your fire!

1692
02:10:38,998 --> 02:10:40,625
Everybody, hold your fire.

1693
02:10:41,459 --> 02:10:44,554
<i>- Unit 2, stand down. Stand down.</i>
<i>- Civilian in our line of sight.</i>

1694
02:10:48,507 --> 02:10:49,554
Kid! You gotta get...

1695
02:10:51,719 --> 02:10:53,517
Look, New York!

1696
02:10:53,763 --> 02:10:55,606
Spider-Man is back.

1697
02:10:56,182 --> 02:10:57,183
Leave the kid alone!

1698
02:10:57,433 --> 02:10:59,356
That's my baby! Please.

1699
02:11:02,438 --> 02:11:04,532
Brave boy. Huh?

1700
02:11:04,815 --> 02:11:07,159
Does Aleksei scare you,
little boy?

1701
02:11:24,460 --> 02:11:25,962
Hey, Spider-Man.

1702
02:11:36,389 --> 02:11:37,686
I knew you'd come back.

1703
02:11:38,182 --> 02:11:40,526
Yeah. Thanks for
stepping up for me.

1704
02:11:40,768 --> 02:11:42,862
You're the bravest kid
I've ever seen.

1705
02:11:43,104 --> 02:11:45,824
I'm gonna take care of this jerk.
You go take care of your mom. Okay?

1706
02:11:46,065 --> 02:11:48,614
All right, get out of here. Go. Go.

1707
02:11:55,658 --> 02:11:56,830
You fight me?

1708
02:11:57,159 --> 02:11:59,958
You fight me now? Huh?

1709
02:12:00,246 --> 02:12:03,591
On behalf of the fine people of New
York City and real rhinos everywhere,

1710
02:12:03,833 --> 02:12:06,837
I ask you to put
your mechanized paws in the air.

1711
02:12:07,086 --> 02:12:08,087
Never!

1712
02:12:08,337 --> 02:12:11,341
I crush you! I kill you! I destroy you!

1713
02:12:11,590 --> 02:12:13,092
You want me to come down there
so you can kill me?

1714
02:12:13,384 --> 02:12:14,385
Yes!

1715
02:12:14,635 --> 02:12:15,978
I'll be right there. Ah...

1716
02:12:16,220 --> 02:12:18,018
There's no place like home.

1716
