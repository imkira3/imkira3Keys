- [Reporter] A round up
of the latest developments

4
00:00:28,616 --> 00:00:30,313
in the finding of a flying disc.

5
00:00:30,356 --> 00:00:32,054
Late this afternoon a
bulletin from New Mexico

6
00:00:32,097 --> 00:00:34,578
suggested that the
widely publicized mystery

7
00:00:34,622 --> 00:00:36,885
of the flying saucers
may soon be solved.

8
00:00:36,928 --> 00:00:38,930
The Army may be getting
to the bottom of all

9
00:00:38,974 --> 00:00:41,803
this talk about the so
called flying saucers.

10
00:00:41,846 --> 00:00:44,545
As a matter of fact, the
509th atomic bomb group

11
00:00:44,588 --> 00:00:47,591
headquarters at Roswell, New
Mexico reports that it has

12
00:00:47,635 --> 00:00:49,680
received one of the
discs which landed on

13
00:00:49,724 --> 00:00:51,769
a ranch outside Roswell,

14
00:00:51,813 --> 00:00:54,555
when the rancher turned
it over to the Air Force.

- This is Jesse Rowen with
a breaking news alert.

17
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:07,002
Reports are in
that space pioneer

18
00:01:07,045 --> 00:01:10,222
and billionaire Alexander Biggs

19
00:01:10,266 --> 00:01:14,618
left earth and departed
for space unexpectedly.

20
00:01:14,662 --> 00:01:17,882
What has led to this
sudden departure?

21
00:01:17,926 --> 00:01:20,276
And, why were none of
the agencies informed?

22
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:26,543
Has he discovered something
we're yet to find out?

23
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:29,677
Or, is he trying to get
away from something?

24
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,028
There are many questions
that need to be asked.

25
00:01:33,071 --> 00:01:34,943
Or, is this just the end
of fate as we know it?

26
00:01:39,774 --> 00:01:41,645
I'm shocked, shocked.

Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

28
00:01:57,052 --> 00:01:58,314

00:02:01,665 --> 00:02:03,624
I need to find out
what really happened.

30

on the dot, sir.

- Well you know what
they say, doctor.

- So I take it the
craft has arrived, yes?

- Like clockwork, sir.

67
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,825
But, we've encountered an
anomaly when the spacecraft

68
00:08:19,869 --> 00:08:21,131
returned.

69
00:08:21,175 --> 00:08:23,829
Now I've cryogenically
frozen the specimen

70
00:08:23,873 --> 00:08:26,354
but further testing
has to be done

- Have you started DNA
sequencing yet, doctor?

No match as of yet.

never seen a species

00:10:29,433 --> 00:10:32,697
be able to turn his emotions
on and off like this.

91
00:10:32,741 --> 00:10:37,485
On one hand, he has shown
signs of pure empathy,

92
00:10:37,528 --> 00:10:40,009
and then on the other
he's demonstrated

93
00:10:40,052 --> 00:10:42,968
absolutely no emotions
at all whatsoever.

94
00:10:44,274 --> 00:10:47,408
It's almost like he's
a biological mood ring.

95
00:10:47,451 --> 00:10:49,497
- Well then I'd suggest you
keep a close eye on him,

96
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,238
doctor.

97

we can about this thing.

no disturbances, okay?

over on the food together?

- How 'bout you
cook, and I'll wash.

Get off of my property.

Gorgeous place
you got here, man.

- Allen?

143
00:14:53,741 --> 00:14:56,091
What the hell are
you doing out here?

144
00:14:56,134 --> 00:14:58,223
- Well, I heard there's
a big Hee Haw style

145
00:14:58,267 --> 00:15:00,574
birthday party going on
out here with banjos,

146
00:15:00,617 --> 00:15:03,925
and hayride, and line dances,
and the whole shebang.

My God, is that
Laura all grown up?

148
00:15:09,626 --> 00:15:13,021
- That's what happens
when you feed 'em.

149
00:15:13,064 --> 00:15:16,633
- You know your father and
I are friends from way back.

150
00:15:16,677 --> 00:15:18,896
As a matter of fact, you
used to call me uncle Al.

151
00:15:21,116 --> 00:15:22,334
- What do you want Allen?

152
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,989
- Well, judging by the
tone you're not going

153
00:15:25,033 --> 00:15:27,470
to invite me in for cake
and ice cream after all.

154
00:15:30,473 --> 00:15:32,083
Maybe we should
take a walk, Jack.

155
00:15:36,697 --> 00:15:38,176
- Take care of this for me, hun.

156
00:15:43,355 --> 00:15:45,575
- I'm working with our
old friend from the unit,

157
00:15:45,619 --> 00:15:46,620
Alexander Biggs.

158
00:15:47,882 --> 00:15:49,274
You know he's made
himself a billionaire

159
00:15:49,318 --> 00:15:51,015
with his aerospace
industries, right?

160
00:15:52,495 --> 00:15:54,236
- How does a beer
drinking grunt like Biggs

161
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:57,544
build an aerospace empire
in less than 20 years?

162
00:15:57,587 --> 00:15:58,849
- He's got something
in mind for you

163
00:15:58,893 --> 00:16:00,503
in the way of a
birthday present.

164
00:16:03,288 --> 00:16:06,422
- Well, that's good for
him, but I think I'm gonna

165
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,423
have to pass.

166
00:16:08,555 --> 00:16:10,034
I want to spend
my 50th right here

00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:13,560
with my 25 year old paint horse
and my 19 year old daughter.

168
00:16:20,784 --> 00:16:23,657
- Jack, he'd really
like to see you.

169
00:16:25,267 --> 00:16:28,096
Ever since he lost Sophia
in the car accident,

170
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:31,491
him and the kid get really
lonely this time of year.

171
00:16:31,534 --> 00:16:34,015
It would mean a lot
to him if you'd come

172
00:16:34,058 --> 00:16:35,799
and just hang out
with him for tonight.

173
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,717
- I'm gonna have to take
a rain check, Allen.

174
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,201
- He told me I
would have to beg.

175
00:16:50,205 --> 00:16:54,078
Please Mr. Adams, he'll
fire me if you don't come.

176
00:16:54,122 --> 00:16:55,471
I swear to God.

177
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,429
Jack don't make me put
my knee in the grass.

178
00:16:57,473 --> 00:16:58,692
- Will you get up?

179
00:16:58,735 --> 00:17:01,259
Allen, you're embarrassing
yourself, get up.

180
00:17:01,303 --> 00:17:02,130
Get up.

181
00:17:02,173 --> 00:17:02,870
- You'll come?

182
00:17:04,001 --> 00:17:05,568
- Yeah, why not?

183
00:17:05,612 --> 00:17:07,352
- You made me do
that, come here.

184
00:17:09,703 --> 00:17:11,618
It'll be fun, believe me.

185
00:17:11,661 --> 00:17:13,010
It's nice working for Biggs.

186
00:17:15,665 --> 00:17:17,667
- I guess a little
reunion wouldn't hurt.

187
00:17:19,321 --> 00:17:20,714
- Get the unit back
together, right?

188
00:17:20,757 --> 00:17:22,716
[laughing]

189
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:24,805
You gonna ask me in for
ice tea or something?

190
00:17:24,848 --> 00:17:25,719
- [Jack] How 'bout
some lemonade?

191
00:17:27,024 --> 00:17:29,636
[dramatic music]

192
00:18:08,675 --> 00:18:10,024
- Jack Adams.

193
00:18:10,067 --> 00:18:11,591
[laughing]

194
00:18:11,634 --> 00:18:12,504
Look at you.

195
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,550
- It's been a long time.

196
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:15,856
- [Alex] Yeah, it has.

197
00:18:15,899 --> 00:18:16,726
And, happy birthday.

198
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:17,858
- Thank you.

199
00:18:17,901 --> 00:18:18,989
- You're looking
crazy good at 50, man.

200
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:20,295
What the heck you been doing?

201
00:18:20,338 --> 00:18:21,078
- What can I say?

202
00:18:21,122 --> 00:18:21,818
Clean living.

203
00:18:23,733 --> 00:18:25,822
This is my daughter Laura Lee.

204
00:18:25,866 --> 00:18:26,736
- Laura.

205
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:28,520
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

206
00:18:28,564 --> 00:18:29,304
- Nice to meet you.

207
00:18:29,347 --> 00:18:30,653
Alexander Biggs.

208
00:18:30,697 --> 00:18:32,916
She's grown up all
beautiful, Jack.

209
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,657
- This place is insane, Alex.

210
00:18:34,701 --> 00:18:35,919
- It is, huh?

211
00:18:35,963 --> 00:18:37,878
Not bad for an ex-solider, huh?

212
00:18:37,921 --> 00:18:40,620
But, I would tell you my
friend there is so much more

213
00:18:40,663 --> 00:18:42,230
to life than just all this.

214
00:18:43,753 --> 00:18:46,713
Speaking of which, what do
you say we fire up the grill?

215
00:18:46,756 --> 00:18:48,584
Have us a barbecue?

216
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:49,367
- Yes.

217
00:18:49,411 --> 00:18:50,194
- You're the host.

218
00:18:50,238 --> 00:18:51,239
- [Alex] All right.

219
00:18:51,282 --> 00:18:54,721
[dramatic orchestral music]

220
00:19:12,782 --> 00:19:13,783
Follow me.

221
00:19:17,047 --> 00:19:19,049
Welcome to my home, Jack.

222
00:19:19,093 --> 00:19:20,529
- It's very impressive, Alex.

223
00:19:22,052 --> 00:19:22,792
- It'll do.

224
00:19:28,929 --> 00:19:30,495
Well, just in time.

225
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:33,063
[ominous music]

226
00:19:33,977 --> 00:19:38,721
Jack, Laura, my son Charlie.

227
00:19:38,765 --> 00:19:40,070
- Hi, nice to meet you, Charlie.

228
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:43,987
- Well, it most certainly is.

229
00:19:46,773 --> 00:19:48,949
- Charlie, I apologize.

230
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:55,520
All right, what do you say I
show you the rest of the house?

231
00:19:55,564 --> 00:19:56,260
Come on.

232
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:00,395
[fire crackling]

50.

235
00:20:20,937 --> 00:20:21,764
- The big Five, O.

236
00:20:22,896 --> 00:20:24,462
- Hey, you know the drill.

237
00:20:25,507 --> 00:20:26,726
Go ahead, Superman.

238
00:20:28,945 --> 00:20:30,860
[blowing]

239
00:20:32,688 --> 00:20:33,863
- I'm pretty exhausted.

240
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:38,041
I'm gonna call it a night.

241
00:20:38,085 --> 00:20:38,738
- No cake?

242
00:20:39,913 --> 00:20:40,783
- I don't eat cake.

243
00:20:42,393 --> 00:20:43,133
Goodnight.

244
00:20:45,614 --> 00:20:46,658
- Goodnight, Charlie.

245
00:20:49,444 --> 00:20:51,185
He doesn't seem too
happy that we're here.

246
00:20:51,228 --> 00:20:53,665
- Yeah well, nothing
makes that kid happy.

247
00:20:58,453 --> 00:21:00,847
- That's a lovely
gesture, my friend.

248
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:03,284
- Nothing but the
best for the best.

249
00:21:03,327 --> 00:21:04,546
- Cheers, Alex.

250
00:21:07,854 --> 00:21:12,772
- As for my present to
you, I want to offer you

251
00:21:12,815 --> 00:21:16,166
a vacation, you and
Laura, the two of you.

252
00:21:17,428 --> 00:21:19,387
It'll be on me,
all expenses paid.

253
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:21,041
I'll have Allen make all
the travel arrangements,

254
00:21:21,084 --> 00:21:23,957
and we can meet up in
about six or seven days,

255
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,611
relax, possibly talk about
your financial future.

256
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,923
Oh come on Jack, don't
be a stick in the mud.

257
00:21:35,533 --> 00:21:36,752
I know where you're at.

258
00:21:39,276 --> 00:21:41,626
We did a lot of things
when we were soldiers.

259
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:45,108
We did what we were told.

260
00:21:45,152 --> 00:21:46,283
That's what we signed up for.

261
00:21:48,068 --> 00:21:52,942
We saw a lot of war, but
a lot of human nature too.

262
00:21:52,986 --> 00:21:53,856
Nothing good, I'm afraid.

263
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:57,817
- What do you think?

264
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,557
- Beach does sound pretty nice.

265
00:22:02,256 --> 00:22:06,651
- You have to give me some
time to think about it.

266
00:22:06,695 --> 00:22:08,697
- Here's to thinking
about it, Jack.

267
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,526
[glasses clinking]

268
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,497
Look you two, you can
visit me anytime you want

269
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:28,456
whether I'm here or
not, [speaking in a
foreign language].

270
00:22:33,069 --> 00:22:33,853
Be safe.

271
00:23:09,932 --> 00:23:12,543
- What are you thinking about?

272
00:23:15,242 --> 00:23:17,722
- How I'm gonna tell you
that I decided to pass

273
00:23:17,766 --> 00:23:19,115
on Alex's job offer.

274
00:23:19,942 --> 00:23:21,422
- Daddy.

275
00:23:21,465 --> 00:23:24,468
- Not the vacation,
just the job.

276
00:23:28,298 --> 00:23:31,954
I gave it a great deal of
thought, but I just can't do it.

277
00:23:36,089 --> 00:23:37,351
I'm not a company man, Laura.

278
00:23:38,613 --> 00:23:40,963
I never have been,
and I never will be.

279
00:23:43,879 --> 00:23:45,098
- I miss mom.

280
00:23:48,405 --> 00:23:51,974
- Yeah, me too, sweetie.

281
00:23:59,982 --> 00:24:03,507
[ominous music]

282
00:24:03,551 --> 00:24:05,422
- [Alex] You know
what to do, Allen.

283
00:24:05,466 --> 00:24:07,250
Make it fast and clean.

Dad!

290
00:25:05,221 --> 00:25:07,180
- Come on, get down.

291
00:25:07,223 --> 00:25:09,008
There's someone in the house.

292
00:25:09,051 --> 00:25:09,965
Let's go.

Go to the barn, get the bike
ready, and I'll meet you there.

298
00:25:45,261 --> 00:25:46,262
- Okay.

No, no, no.

Where's your inhaler?

Breathe, come on be strong.

337
00:28:20,068 --> 00:28:20,982
You've been here before, baby.

338
00:28:21,025 --> 00:28:22,636
You can do this.

339
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:25,291
Breathe, breathe baby, breathe.

340
00:28:27,162 --> 00:28:27,945
Come on.

341
00:28:29,425 --> 00:28:32,298
Come on honey, you can do it.

342
00:28:32,341 --> 00:28:34,256
- It's okay, baby.

343
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:34,996
I'm here now.

344
00:28:35,997 --> 00:28:37,520
You're gonna be all right.

345
00:28:37,564 --> 00:28:39,261
Breathe.

346
00:28:39,305 --> 00:28:40,610
I'm here.

Everything's going
to be all right.

348

It's not your time, baby.

00:28:48,139 --> 00:28:48,836
That's it.

350
00:28:50,054 --> 00:28:51,360
You're gonna go
back with daddy now.

351
00:28:56,539 --> 00:28:57,279
- Come on, honey.

352
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,368
Breathe, yes.

I can't lose you.

Come on, we gotta go.

358
00:29:15,906 --> 00:29:18,300
We gotta get outta here, okay?

359
00:29:18,344 --> 00:29:19,388
Can you stand up?

360
00:29:19,432 --> 00:29:20,650
- I think so.

361
00:29:20,694 --> 00:29:22,348

What are y'all
doing here so late?

366
00:30:33,941 --> 00:30:35,551
- Heather, no questions.

367
00:30:35,595 --> 00:30:38,554
I need a room with
a phone right now.

368
00:30:38,598 --> 00:30:39,686
I'll pay you later.

369
00:30:39,729 --> 00:30:40,426

00:30:42,428 --> 00:30:44,343

- You got me dead to
rights on that one.

- Hey Fred, listen to me.

378
00:31:03,231 --> 00:31:05,146
Laura and I were
attacked tonight

379
00:31:05,189 --> 00:31:07,627
by a group of armed
men wearing ski masks.

380
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:09,629
They shot up my fucking
house, and we barely got

381
00:31:09,672 --> 00:31:11,370
out of there alive.

382
00:31:11,413 --> 00:31:12,458
- Tell me about it partner.

383
00:31:12,501 --> 00:31:13,937
I'm here right now.

384
00:31:13,981 --> 00:31:15,591
Neighbors called it in.

385
00:31:15,635 --> 00:31:17,419
They said your house sounded
like a freaking war zone.

386
00:31:17,463 --> 00:31:18,551
And, let me tell you
something, brother.

387
00:31:18,594 --> 00:31:20,770
Looking around out here,
that's exactly what

388
00:31:20,814 --> 00:31:22,119
it looks like.

389
00:31:22,163 --> 00:31:23,425
We've already got
backup on the way.

390
00:31:23,469 --> 00:31:25,384
Look Jack, I didn't want
to say nothing to you

391
00:31:25,427 --> 00:31:28,038
at first because I didn't
want to worry you none

392
00:31:28,082 --> 00:31:31,955
and Laura and all, but we
kind of got our timing off

393
00:31:31,999 --> 00:31:33,130
tonight a little bit on this.

394
00:31:33,174 --> 00:31:34,654
But, we've been keeping
a pretty close eye

395
00:31:34,697 --> 00:31:36,612
on you for about the last week.

396
00:31:36,656 --> 00:31:38,484
You know running by the
house a couple times a day

397
00:31:38,527 --> 00:31:39,572
and all that.

398
00:31:39,615 --> 00:31:41,008
- Yeah, why is that?

399
00:31:42,488 --> 00:31:46,143
- Well, about a week ago,
I got me a call from a fed.

400
00:31:46,187 --> 00:31:49,233
Apparently, some of the
guys you served with back

401
00:31:49,277 --> 00:31:51,192
in the '90s are either
coming up missing,

402
00:31:51,235 --> 00:31:52,541
or they're coming up dead.

403
00:31:52,585 --> 00:31:54,717
And, he was telling me
all about how your life

404
00:31:54,761 --> 00:31:55,762
might be in danger.

405
00:31:57,807 --> 00:32:01,245
Jack, who could've done this
kind of damage in my town?

- Nice reunion, Alex, but we're
not sure you convinced him.

410
00:32:42,112 --> 00:32:45,812
- Well if I know Jack Adams
the way I believe I do, Victor,

411
00:32:45,855 --> 00:32:47,074
I can assure you it will.

412
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:51,252
- Well, I hope so.

413
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,343
Because we need to
know how Jack's DNA

414
00:32:55,386 --> 00:32:58,041
is connected to Subject A,
and we need to know soon.

Oh, one more thing, Alex.

416
00:33:05,222 --> 00:33:08,008
You need to settle down.

417
00:33:09,575 --> 00:33:10,532
You're out of control.

418
00:33:12,142 --> 00:33:14,667
The council is not only
aware, but they're getting

419
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,407
kind of tired of it, Alex.

420
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:23,240
- Alex, we gave you a
second chance in life.

421
00:33:24,764 --> 00:33:26,592
that was because of your father.

422
00:33:26,635 --> 00:33:27,897
We didn't have to do that.

423
00:33:29,769 --> 00:33:33,729
And in one split second,
we could take it all away.

00:34:04,717 --> 00:34:07,284
for drinks and then
we're gonna party, cool?

430
00:34:07,328 --> 00:34:10,984

and I felt really small.

up, and I'm gonna tag

I'm sorry to interrupt,

458
00:36:57,803 --> 00:36:59,195
but I've been wanting
to congratulate

459
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:02,024
the both of you on your
one year anniversary.

460
00:37:02,068 --> 00:37:03,983
Who knew I'd be doing
it standing over

461
00:37:04,026 --> 00:37:05,419
a military hospital bed?

462
00:37:07,813 --> 00:37:08,814
- Who are you?

463
00:37:10,598 --> 00:37:11,730
How'd you get in here?

464
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:16,082
- I have friends in high places.

465
00:37:16,125 --> 00:37:19,825
My name is Victor Khol, and
this is my assistant Vivian.

466
00:37:22,479 --> 00:37:26,832
Alex, I used to work with your
father way back in the day.

467
00:37:26,875 --> 00:37:29,878
- Sophia, could you
give us a moment please?

468
00:37:29,922 --> 00:37:33,360
- Actually, Alex I think
what I'm about to share

469
00:37:33,403 --> 00:37:34,753
is very, very important.

470
00:37:34,796 --> 00:37:36,624
Your wife needs
to hear the truth.

471
00:37:37,843 --> 00:37:40,236
- Alex, what's going on?

472
00:37:41,498 --> 00:37:43,674
- Your husband has
suffered a severe injury

473
00:37:43,718 --> 00:37:48,854
to the cervical spine at C
one and the C two vertebrae.

474
00:37:48,897 --> 00:37:50,812
The surgeon said that
there is a good chance

475
00:37:50,856 --> 00:37:52,727
that he may never walk again.

476
00:37:55,991 --> 00:37:58,733
- Alex, I know this seems
hopeless, but I think

477
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:01,475
I can help make
all this go away.

478
00:38:01,518 --> 00:38:02,215
- How?

479
00:38:03,869 --> 00:38:05,871
She said I could be a
quad for Christ's sake.

480
00:38:07,916 --> 00:38:11,006
I'll probably never walk
the rest of my life.

481
00:38:15,924 --> 00:38:17,099
Wait a minute.

482
00:38:18,927 --> 00:38:19,885
Victor Khol.

483
00:38:22,539 --> 00:38:24,933
Shit, I remember your name.

484
00:38:26,717 --> 00:38:30,417
My father used to talk to me
about you when I was a kid.

485
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,288
I thought he was
delusional in the end

486
00:38:33,899 --> 00:38:37,946
always talking about ancient
aliens and conspiracy bullshit.

487
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,298
You know they institutionalized
him before he died

488
00:38:43,952 --> 00:38:45,954
ranting this crazy
shit to the press

489
00:38:45,998 --> 00:38:49,784
about how you were from
some faraway universe,

490
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:52,743
and you were over 400 years old.

491
00:38:54,049 --> 00:38:59,750
- Alex, your father was
a genius and a real hero

492
00:38:59,794 --> 00:39:03,842
in my eyes, and the
best friend I ever had.

493
00:39:05,104 --> 00:39:07,715
- We need you to trust
us the way that we

494
00:39:07,758 --> 00:39:09,673
trusted your father.

495
00:39:09,717 --> 00:39:14,591
- Alex, your father
saved our lives.

496
00:39:16,289 --> 00:39:21,250
He gave us a second chance.

497
00:39:23,209 --> 00:39:26,342
Now it's our time
to return the favor.

498

[dramatic music]

500
00:39:37,049 --> 00:39:38,877
- Yes Victor, you saved my life.

501
00:39:41,096 --> 00:39:42,184
You gave me life.

502
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:45,318
And, for that I will
be forever grateful.

503
00:39:47,494 --> 00:39:48,974
But, I must live my life.

504
00:39:53,979 --> 00:39:55,458
I will not let you down.

505
00:39:59,158 --> 00:40:03,205
- Do you remember a few
years after your operation?

506
00:40:03,249 --> 00:40:06,034
Alex, we smoked cigars.

507
00:40:08,732 --> 00:40:10,473
We walked, we talked.

508
00:40:11,648 --> 00:40:16,436
You were so grateful,
so full of joy

509
00:40:18,264 --> 00:40:19,874
for the betterment of humanity.

510
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:22,050
Do you remember this?

511
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:26,359
Alex, I must admit one of my
favorite human past times.

512
00:40:28,491 --> 00:40:30,754
- Obviously, you've
never had sex.

513
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:34,062
- Actually Alex, I have.

514
00:40:35,716 --> 00:40:39,807
But, where we come from
sex is more of a spiritual

515
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:42,157
and mental union rather
than just physical.

516
00:40:45,421 --> 00:40:46,683
- So how do you have babies?

517
00:40:48,859 --> 00:40:50,252
- How do we have babies?

518
00:40:50,296 --> 00:40:51,471
With the power of
the mind, Alex.

519
00:40:54,082 --> 00:40:56,041
[laughing]

520
00:40:56,084 --> 00:40:57,912
- Do you feel anything?

521
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,174
- Of course, I do.

522
00:40:59,218 --> 00:41:01,350
But, that would be
difficult to explain

523
00:41:01,394 --> 00:41:03,396
to a man who's
governed by his penis.

524
00:41:07,269 --> 00:41:09,489
- Well, I may be a
neanderthal to you,

525
00:41:09,532 --> 00:41:12,535
but I'm smart enough to know
that there's a lot you can do

526
00:41:12,579 --> 00:41:13,275
for humanity.

527
00:41:14,711 --> 00:41:16,278
I mean knowing what
you did for me,

528
00:41:16,322 --> 00:41:19,368
just think of how many
lives you can save on Earth

529
00:41:19,412 --> 00:41:21,109
with your technology.

530
00:41:21,153 --> 00:41:22,806
- Believe me Alex, I'd love to.

531
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:25,461
But, we are in fact governed
by rules of non engagement.

532
00:41:27,072 --> 00:41:30,727
You see the council made an
exception on your behalf.

533
00:41:30,771 --> 00:41:33,426
We needed a homo sapien
that we could trust

534
00:41:33,469 --> 00:41:37,908
to be our liaison to do human
things that we simply cannot.

535
00:41:37,952 --> 00:41:40,172
Technically, the council
does not get involved

536
00:41:40,215 --> 00:41:43,088
with any planetary affairs
unless what they're doing

537
00:41:43,131 --> 00:41:44,828
is affecting the
universe as a whole.

538
00:41:46,656 --> 00:41:50,182
Kind of what your species
did back in July of 1945

539
00:41:50,225 --> 00:41:52,880
when you began testing
your first atom bomb.

540
00:41:52,923 --> 00:41:55,796
[booming explosion]

541
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:03,282
- Yeah, my father worked
on the Manhattan Project.

542
00:42:03,325 --> 00:42:05,066
My mother told me how
much it haunted him.

543
00:42:07,808 --> 00:42:10,724
I have a baby boy because
of you and a second chance

544
00:42:10,767 --> 00:42:12,160
on life.

545
00:42:12,204 --> 00:42:15,250
And for that, I'm
eternally grateful, sir.

546
00:42:19,211 --> 00:42:20,212
- Shall we walk?

547
00:42:25,608 --> 00:42:26,392
- I do, Victor.

548
00:42:27,697 --> 00:42:28,481
- Good.

549
00:42:31,658 --> 00:42:33,834
And, if I were you, I'd
do some soul searching

550
00:42:35,227 --> 00:42:40,406
because as Vivian said
you are expendable.

551

[machines beeping]

00:43:13,569 --> 00:43:17,573
Alex, trust me.

555
00:43:17,617 --> 00:43:19,793
When you wake up,
everything will be okay.

556
00:43:19,836 --> 00:43:21,229
I promise.

557
00:43:21,273 --> 00:43:25,277
You will be a new man both
physically and mentally.

[dramatic music]

559
00:43:51,303 --> 00:43:52,956
- Okay, so I'll meet
you at the scarp yard

560
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:53,957
at O 800 tomorrow.

561
00:43:55,176 --> 00:43:58,266
Yeah okay, I'll see you then.

562
00:44:05,621 --> 00:44:06,361
- So what now?

563
00:44:09,277 --> 00:44:11,279
- That was your uncle Kevin.

564
00:44:11,323 --> 00:44:14,326
He's gonna bring us money,
clothes, whatever we need.

565
00:44:16,371 --> 00:44:17,590
- What did Sheriff Fred say?

566
00:44:19,853 --> 00:44:22,725
- Well, it's obvious
somebody's after us.

567
00:44:22,769 --> 00:44:25,250
We don't know who it is
yet, so best thing is

568
00:44:25,293 --> 00:44:27,121
to just lay low
until we know more.

569
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,602
- Who would want to
hurt us like this?

570
00:44:33,127 --> 00:44:34,563
- Hun, it could be anybody.

571
00:44:35,869 --> 00:44:39,307
You have to remember
Alex, Allen, myself,

572
00:44:39,351 --> 00:44:43,311
guys like us, we made a lot
of enemies back in the day.

573
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:49,535
I had access to a lot
of top secret intel,

574
00:44:49,578 --> 00:44:51,841
black ops directives,
you name it.

575
00:44:53,278 --> 00:44:56,019
Most of it was high level
national security stuff.

576
00:44:58,805 --> 00:45:00,023
- I'm really scared.

- Yeah, I know you are, honey.

Look, don't worry, okay.

Everything's going
to be all right.

Look, I took up Alex's
offer for a job, a vacation.

- Really?

- It's what you wanted, right?

[dramatic music]

584

- [Dr. Rice] Mr. Biggs?

- Jack and his daughter will
be here before too long.

I want to know everything
before they do.

[dramatic music]

- Jesus, Jack.

I'm getting too old
for scares like that.

591
00:48:06,253 --> 00:48:07,428
- Hey, it's good
to see you, man.

592
00:48:07,472 --> 00:48:08,473
Thanks for coming on
such short notice.

593
00:48:08,516 --> 00:48:09,430
- Of course.

594
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:11,171
Laura.

595
00:48:11,214 --> 00:48:12,651
- Uncle Kevin.

596
00:48:12,694 --> 00:48:13,391
- Look at you.

597
00:48:14,522 --> 00:48:16,568
You keep getting more beautiful.

598
00:48:16,611 --> 00:48:17,438
- Thank you.

599
00:48:18,744 --> 00:48:21,442
- And, you just keep
getting uglier, don't you?

600
00:48:21,486 --> 00:48:23,705
- It's good to see
you haven't changed.

601
00:48:23,749 --> 00:48:26,447
[laughing]

602
00:48:26,491 --> 00:48:27,666
- [Kevin] This is as
good as I could do

603
00:48:27,709 --> 00:48:29,189
on such short notice.

604
00:48:29,232 --> 00:48:29,972
- That's great, man.

605
00:48:30,016 --> 00:48:30,712
I appreciate it.

606
00:48:33,019 --> 00:48:35,630
- Look Jack, this Alex guy.

607
00:48:37,589 --> 00:48:40,635
I realize that you two
have history, but I had

608
00:48:40,679 --> 00:48:42,898
my CIA buddies look into him.

609
00:48:42,942 --> 00:48:45,553
The guy's been a ghost
for the last 20 years.

610
00:48:45,597 --> 00:48:47,990
Apparently, his wife died
in this horrific car crash

611
00:48:48,034 --> 00:48:51,994
about 20 years ago, and
he just up and disappears.

612
00:48:52,038 --> 00:48:55,824
Then he pops up mysteriously
as a multi billionaire

613
00:48:55,868 --> 00:48:57,347
owner of Biggs Aerospace.

614
00:48:58,566 --> 00:49:00,046
I don't know.

615
00:49:00,089 --> 00:49:01,700
But, what I really want
to know is why does he

616
00:49:01,743 --> 00:49:04,093
all of a sudden have
an interest in you.

617
00:49:04,137 --> 00:49:07,662
I mean no offense,
but I mean why now?

618
00:49:07,706 --> 00:49:09,316
You sure this is a
guy you can trust?

619
00:49:12,928 --> 00:49:16,018
- Ever since Julie lost
her battle with cancer,

620
00:49:16,062 --> 00:49:18,064
you're the only friend
that Laura and I have.

621
00:49:18,107 --> 00:49:21,546
So basically you are
the only person I trust.

622
00:49:21,589 --> 00:49:23,591
[dramatic music]

623
00:49:23,635 --> 00:49:26,376
Biggs wants us to go on a
trip out of the country,

624
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:29,162
the two of us, but honestly
I don't feel comfortable

625
00:49:29,205 --> 00:49:30,119
taking Laura along.

626
00:49:31,817 --> 00:49:34,515
I want to ask if you can
take care of her for awhile.

627
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:36,299
- Of course, you know
Laura's always welcome.

628
00:49:36,343 --> 00:49:38,432
I think I should go
first and check it out.

629
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:39,172
- What?

630
00:49:39,215 --> 00:49:40,042
Dad, no.

631
00:49:40,086 --> 00:49:41,087
You're not going alone.

632
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:42,654
I'm coming.

633
00:49:42,697 --> 00:49:43,959
[dramatic music]

634
00:49:44,003 --> 00:49:46,222
- Laura, this is
not open for debate.

635
00:49:47,702 --> 00:49:49,399
A man just tried to
kill us in our own home.

636
00:49:49,443 --> 00:49:50,836
This is not a game.

637
00:49:50,879 --> 00:49:52,925
It's not open for
discussion, I'm afraid.

638
00:49:52,968 --> 00:49:54,535
- You can't decide that.

639
00:49:54,579 --> 00:49:56,668
Mr. Biggs says he
wants us both to go.

640
00:49:56,711 --> 00:49:58,583
I'm not letting you go
off alone like this,

641
00:49:58,626 --> 00:50:00,628
not now, not ever.

642
00:50:00,672 --> 00:50:02,674
Especially after
what happened to mom,

643
00:50:02,717 --> 00:50:03,805
I'm not losing you too.

644
00:50:05,459 --> 00:50:07,853
- Laura, kiddo, maybe
you better listen

645
00:50:07,896 --> 00:50:10,508
to your father on
this one, okay.

[dramatic music]

647

- Alex?

648
00:50:38,492 --> 00:50:39,406
Hi, it's Jack.

649
00:50:41,016 --> 00:50:41,756
Yeah.

650
00:50:43,845 --> 00:50:46,674
Hey listen, I've been thinking
a lot about your generous

651
00:50:46,718 --> 00:50:47,588
job offer.

652
00:50:51,723 --> 00:50:53,463
Yeah, I'm sure she'll
be a little upset.

653
00:50:56,597 --> 00:50:58,599
It's not about the money.

654
00:50:58,643 --> 00:50:59,557
It's about my sanity.

655
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:04,692
We'll work out the details.

656
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:08,566
[dramatic music]

657
00:51:27,628 --> 00:51:30,109
- So over there's our
science building, Jack.

658
00:51:30,152 --> 00:51:32,546
Within those four walls, a
lot of fascinating research

659
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:33,939
goes on.

660
00:51:33,982 --> 00:51:36,158
We've got our media
assessment offices.

661
00:51:36,202 --> 00:51:40,206
And, that, my friend,
is my crown jewel, Jack,

662
00:51:40,249 --> 00:51:41,381
the aviation department.

663
00:51:43,775 --> 00:51:45,733
- I must admit, Alex,
when you said vacation,

664
00:51:47,387 --> 00:51:48,780
I thought you meant spend
a few days on your yacht

665
00:51:48,823 --> 00:51:50,433
on the ocean.

666
00:51:50,477 --> 00:51:52,914
- Well [laughing] Jack,
there is that too.

667
00:51:52,958 --> 00:51:55,613
But, I told you my
ideas were big, Jack.

668
00:51:55,656 --> 00:51:56,614
They're very big.

669
00:51:57,789 --> 00:51:59,878
They are Biggs big.

670
00:51:59,921 --> 00:52:02,010
[laughing]

671
00:52:04,273 --> 00:52:07,712
What do you say we visit
my science building, huh?

672
00:52:07,755 --> 00:52:10,323
[dramatic music]

673
00:52:23,771 --> 00:52:24,903
So what do you think, Jack?

674
00:52:25,773 --> 00:52:27,383
- What do I think?

675
00:52:28,689 --> 00:52:30,648
I think it's all
impressive as hell.

676
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:33,607
- [Alex] But?

677
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:35,261
- But, why are you
showing me all this?

678
00:52:36,741 --> 00:52:40,788
- Jack, I want you
to join our team.

679
00:52:42,181 --> 00:52:44,487
I want you to pilot our
first manned mission.

680
00:52:48,578 --> 00:52:49,667
- Me, pilot?

681
00:52:51,712 --> 00:52:53,148
I don't fly, Alex.

682
00:52:53,192 --> 00:52:56,630
And, I don't see anything
here that I could--

683
00:52:56,674 --> 00:53:01,417
- Jack, there is much
more to see, my friend.

684
00:53:03,289 --> 00:53:04,856
But only if you're
truly interested,

685
00:53:04,899 --> 00:53:05,900
and you are ready.

686
00:53:14,082 --> 00:53:15,562
Oh, Dr. Rice.

687
00:53:15,605 --> 00:53:16,911
- Yes.

688
00:53:16,955 --> 00:53:18,565
- This is my friend Jack.

689
00:53:18,608 --> 00:53:20,959
I thought he'd be interested
in our activities here.

690
00:53:21,002 --> 00:53:23,004
- It's a pleasure, Mr. Adams.

691
00:53:23,048 --> 00:53:24,092
We have been expecting you.

692
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:26,965
Would you follow me please?

693
00:53:41,936 --> 00:53:43,329
- Oh, this is Dr. Ramesh.

694
00:53:43,372 --> 00:53:45,418
He's one of my lead
research engineers.

695
00:53:45,461 --> 00:53:47,768
None of this could be
possible without this amazing

696
00:53:47,812 --> 00:53:49,074
team of minds we've
put together here.

697
00:53:49,117 --> 00:53:51,424
- Dr. Ramesh, pleasure.

698
00:53:51,467 --> 00:53:54,862
- Dr. Ramesh, this is
my friend Jack Adams.

699
00:53:54,906 --> 00:53:57,560
- Mr. Jack Adams, Dr. Ramesh.

700
00:53:57,604 --> 00:53:59,824
It's just a pleasure
to have you here.

701
00:53:59,867 --> 00:54:01,086
We have prepared
everything for you,

702
00:54:01,129 --> 00:54:03,784
and it's just gonna be great.

703
00:54:03,828 --> 00:54:06,744
We are so excited to
have you here in person.

704
00:54:06,787 --> 00:54:08,006
Shall we proceed?

705
00:54:08,049 --> 00:54:08,833
- Lead the way, Ramesh.

706
00:54:08,876 --> 00:54:09,747
- All right.

707
00:54:18,364 --> 00:54:21,019
[dramatic music]

708
00:55:04,062 --> 00:55:05,890
Hello doctor, how's it going?

709
00:55:11,373 --> 00:55:12,157
- Hello, sir.

710
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:23,603
- The kids.

711
00:55:32,481 --> 00:55:33,918
My pride and joy, Jack.

712
00:55:34,788 --> 00:55:37,443
[dramatic music]

713
00:55:49,977 --> 00:55:53,676
[screechy music]

714
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:54,982
- What the hell just happened?

715
00:55:56,027 --> 00:55:58,899
[Alex laughing]

716
00:55:58,943 --> 00:56:00,292
- I just love this thing, Jack.

717
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:04,774
I mean it gets me every
single time, Jack.

718
00:56:04,818 --> 00:56:07,429
[dramatic music]

719
00:56:24,098 --> 00:56:25,012
- That's amazing.

720
00:56:26,492 --> 00:56:29,147
[dramatic music]

721
00:56:34,021 --> 00:56:34,804
- Watch closely.

722
00:56:38,547 --> 00:56:41,986
[electronic pulsing]

723
00:56:42,029 --> 00:56:44,510
[Alex laughing]

724
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:46,947
- Great, thank you.

725
00:56:46,991 --> 00:56:48,166
Great, thank you.

726
00:56:49,863 --> 00:56:50,646
- So Jack?

727
00:56:55,086 --> 00:56:59,351
- I don't know what to say.

728
00:56:59,394 --> 00:57:01,179
What do you plan
on using this for?

729
00:57:01,222 --> 00:57:03,355
Transporting water from the
Great Lakes to California

730
00:57:03,398 --> 00:57:04,182
and the West.

731
00:57:04,225 --> 00:57:06,401
- No, no, Jack.

732
00:57:06,445 --> 00:57:09,230
Although that is a
wonderful thought.

733
00:57:12,755 --> 00:57:14,061
I got bigger plans, Jack.

734
00:57:16,716 --> 00:57:19,458
Get him a towel, Ramesh
and save the fish.

735
00:57:19,501 --> 00:57:21,242
- Yes, sir.

736
00:57:21,286 --> 00:57:23,766
[ominous music]

737
00:57:34,168 --> 00:57:34,952
Clean yourself up.

738
00:57:38,346 --> 00:57:39,652
[laughing]

739
00:57:39,695 --> 00:57:41,088
[throat clearing]

740
00:57:41,132 --> 00:57:42,046
Sorry.

741
00:57:44,091 --> 00:57:46,485
- Water transfer was
a huge leap for us.

742
00:57:46,528 --> 00:57:47,965
When we discovered
the right combination

743
00:57:48,008 --> 00:57:49,662
of elements last year.

744
00:57:49,705 --> 00:57:51,142
- Last year?

745
00:57:51,185 --> 00:57:52,795
What about this year?

746
00:57:52,839 --> 00:57:55,450
[dramatic music]

747
00:57:58,236 --> 00:57:59,019
- So tell me, Jack.

748
00:58:02,109 --> 00:58:05,199
What do you know
about the Red Planet?

749
00:58:05,243 --> 00:58:06,809
I mean actually living there.

750
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:10,770
- Well, it's cold.

751
00:58:10,813 --> 00:58:13,425
Too cold to live in
except in the center

752
00:58:13,468 --> 00:58:17,472
where it's like our equator,
but at night, very cold,

753
00:58:19,170 --> 00:58:20,127
a lot of ice.

754
00:58:22,651 --> 00:58:24,262
It's not all red like
we normally show.

755
00:58:24,305 --> 00:58:26,264
It does have a green side to it.

756
00:58:26,307 --> 00:58:28,831
- Wow, pretty darn
accurate, my friend.

757
00:58:29,919 --> 00:58:31,095
Good for you.

758
00:58:31,138 --> 00:58:33,445
- Why are you planning
on going to Mars, Alex?

759
00:58:33,488 --> 00:58:34,707
[laughing]

760
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:35,882
- Hell no.

761
00:58:35,925 --> 00:58:37,927
It's too damn close to home.

762
00:58:37,971 --> 00:58:40,539
[dramatic music]

763
00:58:51,767 --> 00:58:53,726
We've discovered a way
to manipulate the gravity

764
00:58:53,769 --> 00:58:56,207
of the planets
and the sun, Jack,

765
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:59,253
moving their orbits closer
to the sun like our orbit.

766
00:58:59,297 --> 00:59:02,039
So living on Mars,
the Moon, meteors,

767
00:59:02,082 --> 00:59:05,259
anywhere for that
matter for human beings,

768
00:59:05,303 --> 00:59:06,043
it's possible.

769
00:59:07,174 --> 00:59:09,829
[dramatic music]

770
00:59:15,095 --> 00:59:15,922
[buzzing]

771
00:59:15,965 --> 00:59:17,489
Come on.

772
00:59:17,532 --> 00:59:20,057
[dramatic music]

773
00:59:40,425 --> 00:59:43,210
- Hey cousin Laura, what are
you doing on the computer?

774
00:59:43,254 --> 00:59:45,995
- Oh, I'm just
doing some research.

775
00:59:46,039 --> 00:59:47,388
- I can help you.

776
00:59:47,432 --> 00:59:49,738
I'm really good at doing
research on the computer.

777
00:59:51,523 --> 00:59:54,395
- Adam, sport, why don't you
leave your cousin Laura alone?

778
00:59:55,875 --> 00:59:57,529
- Uncle Kevin, it's okay.

779
00:59:57,572 --> 00:59:59,487
I really don't mind
him asking questions.

780
01:00:01,141 --> 01:00:04,362
- Speaking of homework little
one, have you finished yours?

781
01:00:04,405 --> 01:00:06,146
- What, this guy?

782
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:07,278
I bet that you got
your homework done

783
01:00:07,321 --> 01:00:09,410
before you even got
home, didn't you?

784
01:00:09,454 --> 01:00:10,585
- Yeah, I did.

785
01:00:10,629 --> 01:00:11,847
[Kevin laughing]

786
01:00:11,891 --> 01:00:12,848
- That's my boy.

787
01:00:12,892 --> 01:00:14,198
Come here.

788
01:00:14,241 --> 01:00:15,329
Get over here.

789
01:00:18,419 --> 01:00:19,551
- Aunt Kate?

790
01:00:19,594 --> 01:00:20,943
- Yeah?

791
01:00:20,987 --> 01:00:21,944
- Do you need any
help with dinner?

792
01:00:21,988 --> 01:00:23,120
- Oh, thanks for
offering, honey.

793
01:00:23,163 --> 01:00:24,077
I've got it, thanks.

794
01:00:29,169 --> 01:00:30,866
- Oh hey, look at that.

795
01:00:30,910 --> 01:00:32,346
It might be your dad calling.

796
01:00:33,869 --> 01:00:34,696
- Jack?

797
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:36,263
- Hi, it's me.

798
01:00:36,307 --> 01:00:37,395
- Hey buddy, it's good to
hear that you're getting

799
01:00:37,438 --> 01:00:39,440
a signal with that
cell phone I gave you.

800
01:00:39,484 --> 01:00:41,964
So tell me, how's it
going down there, brother?

801
01:00:42,008 --> 01:00:44,141
- The research they're
doing here is so much more

802
01:00:44,184 --> 01:00:47,927
advanced than anyone else
government or private.

803
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:49,407
Their technological
breakthroughs

804
01:00:49,450 --> 01:00:50,147
are mind boggling.

805
01:00:51,713 --> 01:00:54,238
Look, I know it's
crazy, but he showed me

806
01:00:54,281 --> 01:00:56,196
some of their discoveries.

807
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:59,373
They've made huge,
wonderful steps forward,

808
01:00:59,417 --> 01:01:01,462
displacing water from
one place to another,

809
01:01:02,768 --> 01:01:05,249
stuff I could never
even of dreamed of.

810
01:01:05,292 --> 01:01:06,685
- Wow.

811
01:01:06,728 --> 01:01:08,295
You know I always
assumed Biggs was working

812
01:01:08,339 --> 01:01:10,384
on something huge out there.

813
01:01:10,428 --> 01:01:12,386
But, this sounds like
something beyond anything

814
01:01:12,430 --> 01:01:13,082
I could've imagined.

815
01:01:14,345 --> 01:01:16,869
- These things are far
beyond my understanding.

816
01:01:18,262 --> 01:01:21,090
- Yeah, mine too.

817
01:01:21,134 --> 01:01:24,006
- Look, but like any
scientific discoveries,

818
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:25,182
they have a dark side.

819
01:01:28,272 --> 01:01:30,361
Look, I'm not sure exactly
what's going on here.

820
01:01:30,404 --> 01:01:31,797
I gotta go.

821
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:34,843
- Hey Jack, I got
Laura right here.

822
01:01:34,887 --> 01:01:36,149
You want to say hi to her?

823
01:01:40,762 --> 01:01:42,373
- Hi dad?

824
01:01:42,416 --> 01:01:44,070
- Laura, are you okay?

825
01:01:45,463 --> 01:01:47,378
- Yeah, we're at uncle Kevin's.

826
01:01:47,421 --> 01:01:49,597
Aunt Kate is making
dinner right now.

827
01:01:49,641 --> 01:01:50,250
- Good girl.

828
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:53,210
All right baby girl, I gotta go,

829
01:01:54,298 --> 01:01:55,951
but I love you, okay?

830
01:01:55,995 --> 01:01:56,822
- Okay, I love you too.

831
01:01:56,865 --> 01:02:00,304
Stay safe.

[dramatic piano music]

833
01:02:07,528 --> 01:02:11,532
- Look kiddo, your dad is
the toughest guy that I know.

834
01:02:11,576 --> 01:02:12,794
He's gonna be fine.

835
01:02:12,838 --> 01:02:15,710
Trust me, he'll be back
before you know it.

836
01:02:18,322 --> 01:02:19,323
- You're right.

[dramatic orchestral music]

838
01:02:39,473 --> 01:02:40,996
- My crown jewel, Jack.

839
01:02:42,824 --> 01:02:44,304
- See, that's right here.

840
01:02:44,348 --> 01:02:46,219
- No, I don't think that is.

841
01:02:46,263 --> 01:02:47,394
I'm having trouble with that.

842
01:02:47,438 --> 01:02:49,091
- We figured out how
to handle the forces

843
01:02:49,135 --> 01:02:52,051
of gravity through reverse
engineering 60 years ago.

844
01:02:54,358 --> 01:02:57,317
We just figured out
how to master it.

845
01:02:57,361 --> 01:02:59,276
It's all free and
unlimited energy.

846
01:03:00,451 --> 01:03:02,235
- So the disclosures were true?

847
01:03:04,237 --> 01:03:05,020
Amazing.

848
01:03:06,674 --> 01:03:08,676
So this ship can get
us into outer space?

849
01:03:09,895 --> 01:03:13,202
- I've already been there, Jack.

850
01:03:13,246 --> 01:03:13,942
- You?

851
01:03:14,813 --> 01:03:15,640
You've already been to Mars?

852
01:03:15,683 --> 01:03:16,945
- And beyond, Jack.

853
01:03:19,339 --> 01:03:22,255
And, we can go,
you and I, together

854
01:03:23,517 --> 01:03:25,345
just as soon as you say yes.

855
01:03:25,389 --> 01:03:26,520
It could be as early
as this afternoon.

856
01:03:26,564 --> 01:03:28,609
It's as easy [snapping
fingers] as that.

857
01:03:33,658 --> 01:03:35,268
- Be honest with me, Alex.

858
01:03:37,444 --> 01:03:39,011
Why me of all people?

859
01:03:41,143 --> 01:03:43,798
- Jack, a mission
to a foreign planet

860
01:03:45,365 --> 01:03:48,325
exploring planet collectors,
anti gravitation devices

861
01:03:48,368 --> 01:03:50,544
that'll swing it into a
friendly orbit around the sun

862
01:03:50,588 --> 01:03:53,417
will take a man of great
courage and toughness.

863
01:03:55,810 --> 01:03:57,551
Someone I can count on, Jack.

864
01:04:01,076 --> 01:04:02,817
I've seen what you're
truly capable of out

865
01:04:02,861 --> 01:04:04,776
in the field, Jack,
with my own eyes.

866
01:04:06,081 --> 01:04:08,345
It's a lot to take
in, Jack, I know.

[dramatic music]

- Not what you were
thinking, huh Jack?

870
01:04:27,189 --> 01:04:30,105
- Who is that, some
kind of prisoner?

871
01:04:32,978 --> 01:04:37,156
- Jack, that is an
extraterrestrial being, Jack.

872
01:04:38,592 --> 01:04:40,768
My robo-nauts came across
it from a newly discovered

873
01:04:40,812 --> 01:04:43,205
planet, X Three, during
the last expedition.

874
01:04:45,860 --> 01:04:48,385
It's our sister
galaxy next door.

875
01:04:49,603 --> 01:04:52,998
We were able to tap
into a black hole, Jack.

[dramatic music]

879
01:05:11,930 --> 01:05:13,888
We need to revisit
that planet with you.

880
01:05:15,629 --> 01:05:18,458
It has the same
negative type alien DNA

881
01:05:18,502 --> 01:05:20,982
that you have
inside of you, Jack.

882
01:05:21,026 --> 01:05:22,636
- What?

883
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:25,596
- I know we're still
trying to figure out why.

884
01:05:25,639 --> 01:05:29,513
Theory is that, well
he's a version of you

885
01:05:29,556 --> 01:05:34,256
from a parallel universe
perhaps even a star child.

886
01:05:36,215 --> 01:05:38,173
My robo-nauts identified
him as a threat.

887
01:05:38,217 --> 01:05:39,697
He got too close to
the ship, so they

888
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:41,873
actually froze him, picked
him up for analysis.

889
01:05:45,529 --> 01:05:48,532
We need to learn everything
we can about him,

890
01:05:48,575 --> 01:05:50,490
his species, his culture.

891
01:05:55,713 --> 01:05:58,803
That is actually why I need
you to come with me, Jack.

892
01:06:01,022 --> 01:06:04,461
You're the only earth
connection to it so far.

893
01:06:04,504 --> 01:06:06,419
- This is unreal, Alex.

894
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:09,814
- No Jack, it is very real.

01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:13,470
And, for you to even
to begin to understand

896
01:06:13,513 --> 01:06:15,341
the magnitude of the work
that we are doing here,

897
01:06:15,384 --> 01:06:18,170
you will have to take
the next step with me.

898
01:06:21,956 --> 01:06:24,089
Jack, there could be
multiple versions of each

899
01:06:24,132 --> 01:06:25,699
and every one of us out there.

900
01:06:29,311 --> 01:06:30,704
Your wife could be there, Jack.

- Yes mam, thank you.

that you've met my niece

It's been reported
by eyewitness sources

that Charles Biggs,
the son of billionaire

and Biggs Aerospace
CEO Alexander Biggs

sexual misconduct.

of the recent me too movements.

And just in, we have
some live updates

01:08:47,275 --> 01:08:49,060
on this breaking news
that Charlie Biggs

952
01:08:49,103 --> 01:08:51,845
has lashed out against
his accusers and the media

953
01:08:51,889 --> 01:08:53,934
with a statement on
his Zipper account

accusations matter.

space with the aliens.

Wow, is this for real, Chuck?

962
01:09:07,861 --> 01:09:09,907
I mean we've known that
Alexander Biggs' son

01:09:09,950 --> 01:09:11,996
may have borderline
personality disorder

as even mentioned by his
father in his defense

965
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:18,698
when he got into trouble,
but this is just ridiculous.

966
01:09:18,742 --> 01:09:20,004
We have not heard
a response back

967
01:09:20,047 --> 01:09:22,659
from Alexander Biggs
or Biggs Aerospace

968

regarding this disclosure
by Charles Biggs.

you with the most up to date

- Actually aunt Kate, I'm sorry,

975
01:09:35,933 --> 01:09:37,848
but I'm not feeling too well.

976
01:09:37,891 --> 01:09:38,718
I think I should go lie down.

977
01:09:38,762 --> 01:09:40,415
- Oh no honey, I'm sorry.

978
01:09:40,459 --> 01:09:42,330
Maybe if you eat something
you'll feel better.

981
01:09:45,116 --> 01:09:46,334
when you're ready.

982
01:09:46,378 --> 01:09:47,771
- Thank you.

983
01:09:47,814 --> 01:09:48,989
- You sure you're feeling okay?

984
01:09:49,033 --> 01:09:50,904
- Yeah, I should be fine.

985
01:09:53,211 --> 01:09:54,908
- Look, it's stressful I know.

986
01:09:54,952 --> 01:09:56,257
I get it.

987
01:09:56,301 --> 01:09:58,433
Why don't you just go
rest up, and we'll be

988
01:09:58,477 --> 01:09:59,696
down here if you need us.

989
01:10:00,827 --> 01:10:01,785
- Okay.

990
01:10:01,828 --> 01:10:02,655
- [Kate] Get some rest.

991
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:03,482
- Thank you.

992
01:10:03,525 --> 01:10:04,439
- Of course.

993
01:10:12,099 --> 01:10:13,927
- Inside of that
room right there.

994
01:10:15,102 --> 01:10:15,842
Go on.

995
01:10:23,415 --> 01:10:28,159
- Alex, open the door.

996
01:10:28,202 --> 01:10:29,987
Open this door.

997
01:10:30,030 --> 01:10:32,685
- I'm so sorry that it
had to be this way, Jack.

998
01:10:32,729 --> 01:10:33,991
I truly am.

999
01:10:34,034 --> 01:10:36,471
- Open this God damn
door, Alex, right now.

1000
01:10:36,515 --> 01:10:38,822
- Jack, I need you to
think things through.

1001
01:10:40,519 --> 01:10:43,914
Now, it's gonna start getting
a bit chilly in there.

1002
01:10:45,393 --> 01:10:46,917
- You're crazy, man.

1003
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:48,962
You're fucking crazy.

1004
01:10:49,006 --> 01:10:53,314
- Until your answer is
yes, I'm ready to go, Alex.

1005
01:10:53,358 --> 01:10:55,273
- Don't hold your
breath waiting man.

1006
01:10:55,316 --> 01:10:56,840
Open the door.

1007
01:10:56,883 --> 01:10:59,451
- You will be going into
space with me, Jack,

1008
01:10:59,494 --> 01:11:01,888
perhaps even, hell, tomorrow.

1009
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:04,848
[laughing]

1010
01:11:04,891 --> 01:11:06,545
- I wouldn't bet on it.

1011
01:11:06,588 --> 01:11:08,765
- Oh, and there is no need
for you know an elaborate

1012
01:11:08,808 --> 01:11:09,548
escape.

1013
01:11:10,984 --> 01:11:11,898
There is none.

1014
01:11:13,465 --> 01:11:16,033
And, don't you worry about
your sweet Laura Lee.

1015
01:11:16,076 --> 01:11:18,687
- You touch my daughter,
and I will kill you.

1016
01:11:18,731 --> 01:11:21,603
- Oh, and you know she's
due here any moment.

1017
01:11:23,605 --> 01:11:26,086
- You touch her,
you're a dead man.

1018
01:11:26,130 --> 01:11:29,133
I promise you I will kill you.

[dramatic music]

1020
01:11:33,528 --> 01:11:36,793
I swear to God I am
gonna kill you, Alex.

1021
01:11:36,836 --> 01:11:38,359
- Jack, you've seen
our technology,

1022
01:11:39,621 --> 01:11:42,668
and you know what
we're capable of here.

1023
01:11:42,711 --> 01:11:46,019
We can do this,
you and I together.

1024
01:11:49,196 --> 01:11:50,328
- Open this door.

1025
01:11:52,330 --> 01:11:53,810
- Laura's gonna be fine, Jack.

1026
01:11:54,941 --> 01:11:56,769
You're just going
to space with me.

1027
01:11:57,944 --> 01:12:01,034
- Alex, get back here, Alex!

1028
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:04,429
Alex!

1029
01:12:04,472 --> 01:12:05,169
Alex!

1030
01:12:06,561 --> 01:12:07,345
Alex!

1031
01:12:10,870 --> 01:12:11,653

- Jack is being complicated.

1043
01:13:49,099 --> 01:13:50,448
- Yes, I've noticed, sir.

1044
01:13:50,491 --> 01:13:51,492
I thought he would be.

1045
01:13:57,498 --> 01:14:01,067
- We don't have much
time to break him.

1046
01:14:01,111 --> 01:14:02,503
Are the others ready?

1047
01:14:02,547 --> 01:14:03,765
- Just in time.

1048
01:14:11,034 --> 01:14:11,991
- Excellent.

1049
01:14:14,211 --> 01:14:17,910
[electronic reverberating]

[tense music]

1055
01:15:16,882 --> 01:15:20,103
- I suggest we move
onto the provoking test.

1056
01:15:20,146 --> 01:15:21,582
- Yeah, let's do it.

1057
01:15:21,626 --> 01:15:23,932
Let's see if this thing
has any violent instincts.

1058
01:15:23,976 --> 01:15:24,672
- Excellent.

1059
01:15:30,635 --> 01:15:33,246
[tense music]

1060
01:15:59,272 --> 01:16:00,795
- What is happening?

1061
01:16:00,839 --> 01:16:02,406
Why are those soldiers armed?

1062
01:16:02,449 --> 01:16:04,103
- Relax, Dr. Rice.

1063
01:16:05,322 --> 01:16:08,368
- But, he has not
posed any threat to us.

1064
01:16:08,412 --> 01:16:10,370
It's obvious he's benevolent.

1065
01:16:10,414 --> 01:16:12,372
Anybody can see that.

1066
01:16:12,416 --> 01:16:14,679
- All creatures must
know to defend, doctor.

1067
01:16:14,722 --> 01:16:16,376
We need to know the
strengths and capabilities

1068
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:18,639
of this thing, how he
attacks, how he defends,

1069
01:16:18,683 --> 01:16:19,553
how he thinks.

1070
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:22,687
Without that data, we're
all potentially compromised.

1071
01:16:22,730 --> 01:16:24,993
I don't care how
peaceful he looks.

1072
01:16:25,037 --> 01:16:26,299
- It's just a test, Dr. Rice.

1073
01:16:26,343 --> 01:16:28,301
I promise he won't be hurt.

1074

[tense music]

1075
01:16:52,195 --> 01:16:56,112
- Mr. Adams, I just need
a few minutes with you.

1076
01:16:56,155 --> 01:16:57,635
I'd like to explain
what we're up to

1077
01:16:57,678 --> 01:16:59,593
and also be able to
check your vitals.

1078
01:17:01,465 --> 01:17:02,770
Will you please
take your jacket off

1079
01:17:02,814 --> 01:17:04,207
and roll up your left sleeve up?

1080
01:17:37,805 --> 01:17:38,589
Leave us.

1081
01:17:43,202 --> 01:17:45,900
[dramatic music]

1082
01:17:54,213 --> 01:17:55,823
Give me a deep

1083
01:17:59,827 --> 01:18:01,264
Exhale.

[electronic beeping]

I just have a few seconds
'cause I've just jammed

1087
01:18:11,926 --> 01:18:13,363
the security cam.

1088
01:18:13,406 --> 01:18:16,931
Biggs is not who he
perceives himself to be.

1089
01:18:16,975 --> 01:18:20,021
He is abusing Subject A.

1090
01:18:20,065 --> 01:18:23,199
His intentions are not for
the betterment of mankind.

1091
01:18:23,242 --> 01:18:26,463
It is purely for his
own personal benefit.

1092
01:18:26,506 --> 01:18:30,815
Subject A is gonna die
if he doesn't stop it.

1093
01:18:30,858 --> 01:18:33,426
Do you understand this?

1094
01:18:33,470 --> 01:18:36,081
[dramatic music]

1095
01:18:36,124 --> 01:18:39,084
Okay, you look and
sound pretty good.

1096
01:18:43,393 --> 01:18:46,570
I'll be back in a little
bit to check up on you.

[dramatic music]

Father?

1100
01:19:06,111 --> 01:19:09,680
[dramatic orchestral music]

1101
01:19:14,337 --> 01:19:15,120
- Where am I?

1102
01:19:17,644 --> 01:19:18,645
Is this a dream?

1103
01:19:20,081 --> 01:19:23,389
- No, we are in
your consciousness.

1104
01:19:24,956 --> 01:19:27,350
- Why are you calling me father?

1105
01:19:27,393 --> 01:19:28,742
Who are you?

1106
01:19:28,786 --> 01:19:33,051
- I am your offspring
from another world.

1107
01:19:33,094 --> 01:19:35,662
[dramatic orchestral music]

1108
01:19:35,706 --> 01:19:36,707
- That's not possible.

1109
01:19:38,361 --> 01:19:42,626
- My name is Metah, and I am
your star child, Jack Adams.

1110
01:19:46,369 --> 01:19:51,287
I come from an ancient planet
of highly evolved species.

1111
01:19:55,116 --> 01:19:58,294
Our predecessors
died 'cause of greed

1112
01:19:59,730 --> 01:20:01,035
and useless war.

1113
01:20:04,387 --> 01:20:09,174
Our great spiritual leaders
and advanced scientists

1114
01:20:09,217 --> 01:20:13,744
knew what was going to
happen, so they created us

1115
01:20:16,399 --> 01:20:20,141
using the best DNA strands
from across the universe.

1116
01:20:22,492 --> 01:20:24,929
They kept us secret
until the war was over.

1117
01:20:27,366 --> 01:20:32,328
Over the last century, we
have evolved into a beautiful

1118
01:20:34,112 --> 01:20:35,940
hybrid species.

1119
01:20:39,639 --> 01:20:44,514
We are a peaceful species with
no negativity in our hearts.

1120
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:55,394
We were never meant to
be found by an evil man

1121
01:20:55,438 --> 01:20:58,571
like your Alexander Biggs.

1122
01:21:03,489 --> 01:21:08,451
Our planet, our sun is dying.

1123

[dramatic orchestral music]

1124
01:21:12,585 --> 01:21:17,111
And if it goes,
we will also die.

1125
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:22,552
- This is all...

1126
01:21:24,031 --> 01:21:25,468
This is incredible.

1127
01:21:27,731 --> 01:21:29,646
I don't know what to say.

1128
01:21:29,689 --> 01:21:34,564
- Our questors came to your
planet a long time ago.

1129
01:21:36,174 --> 01:21:37,393
Do you remember that father?

1130
01:21:42,441 --> 01:21:46,489
I vaguely remember
some childhood dreams,

1131
01:21:46,532 --> 01:21:49,622
but I never imagined
that they were real.

1132
01:21:50,971 --> 01:21:52,451
- Your dreams were reality.

1133
01:21:54,671 --> 01:21:57,151
Homo sapiens are one
of the few species

1134
01:21:57,195 --> 01:21:58,675
who can live without sunlight.

1135
01:22:00,677 --> 01:22:05,159
But, my people were
highly interested in you,

1136
01:22:07,597 --> 01:22:12,515
human but animalistic, yet
loving and compassionate,

1137
01:22:20,261 --> 01:22:23,613
a rare find on
your young planet.

1138
01:22:25,615 --> 01:22:30,576
- My son, yes, yes,
you are my son.

1139
01:22:32,186 --> 01:22:35,755
[dramatic orchestral music]

1140
01:22:37,627 --> 01:22:38,889
What can I do to help you?

1141
01:22:39,846 --> 01:22:44,634

- Tell him to put
me down, Allen.

1147
01:23:44,563 --> 01:23:45,564
Put me down.

1148
01:23:45,608 --> 01:23:46,739
Come on.

1149
01:23:46,783 --> 01:23:49,568
Fucking, Allen, tell
him to put me down.

1150
01:23:49,612 --> 01:23:50,700
Allen, what are you doing?

1151
01:23:50,743 --> 01:23:51,744
Come on.

1152
01:23:51,788 --> 01:23:54,094
Tell him to put me down, Allen.

1153
01:23:54,138 --> 01:23:55,792
Just tell him to
put me down, please.

1154
01:23:55,835 --> 01:23:56,923
Tell him to put me down, man.

1155
01:23:56,967 --> 01:23:57,663
Come on.

1156
01:23:59,447 --> 01:24:01,972
Just tell him to
put me down, okay.

1157
01:24:03,190 --> 01:24:04,104
That's all you gotta do.

1158
01:24:04,148 --> 01:24:05,584
I can pay you.

1159
01:24:05,628 --> 01:24:07,064
I can pay you, Allen.

1160
01:24:07,107 --> 01:24:08,369
I know you want the money.

1161
01:24:09,936 --> 01:24:10,720
Please.

1162
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:15,681
Dad, dad, tell Allen to
tell him to put me down.

1163
01:24:15,725 --> 01:24:17,335
Tell Allen to tell him
to put me down, dad.

1164
01:24:17,378 --> 01:24:20,164
Come on, what are you doing?

1165
01:24:20,207 --> 01:24:21,252
Come on, dad.

1166
01:24:21,295 --> 01:24:22,601
I think he's confused.

1167
01:24:23,689 --> 01:24:24,864
Dad?

1168
01:24:24,908 --> 01:24:25,778
All right Dad, look.

1169
01:24:25,822 --> 01:24:27,650
I'll stop fucking up, okay?

1170
01:24:27,693 --> 01:24:28,694
It was an accident.

1171
01:24:28,738 --> 01:24:29,608
Just fucking tell him.

1172
01:24:31,697 --> 01:24:33,656
Dad, tell him to put me down.

1173
01:24:36,615 --> 01:24:37,834
- Chill him.

1174
01:24:37,877 --> 01:24:38,791
- No!

1175
01:24:38,835 --> 01:24:40,271
No, no, no!

1176
01:24:40,314 --> 01:24:41,011
Dad, dad.

1177
01:24:42,316 --> 01:24:43,274
What are you doing?

1178
01:24:43,317 --> 01:24:44,754
Please just, dad, come on.

1179
01:24:44,797 --> 01:24:46,712
Tell him to get me
out of here, dad.

1188
01:26:22,852 --> 01:26:25,332
- Hey Jack, Jack?

1189
01:26:28,727 --> 01:26:31,556
You know I'm running
out of time, soldier.

1190
01:26:31,599 --> 01:26:34,994
I need your answer,
and I need it now.

1191
01:26:35,038 --> 01:26:36,692
- Shut the fuck up, Alex.

1192
01:26:38,128 --> 01:26:39,303
Where's Laura?

1193
01:26:40,217 --> 01:26:41,958
I want to see my daughter.

1194
01:26:42,001 --> 01:26:45,788
- You know Jack, today I
had to freeze my baby boy.

1195
01:26:48,312 --> 01:26:51,228
First my wife Sophia
and then my son.

1196
01:26:52,925 --> 01:26:54,492
You know how that feels, Jack?

1197
01:26:58,061 --> 01:27:01,891
Oh, that's right, you
know what it feels like

1198
01:27:01,934 --> 01:27:03,327
to lose a wife and a child, yes?

1199
01:27:07,026 --> 01:27:09,725
Yes, your wife Juile.

1200
01:27:09,768 --> 01:27:11,030
- Why don't you shut up, Alex?

1201
01:27:12,336 --> 01:27:14,425
- It's a shame her
dying in the hospital

1202
01:27:14,468 --> 01:27:15,687
with cancer like that.

1203
01:27:17,863 --> 01:27:20,953
I mean how could you ever forget
something like that, Jack?

1204
01:27:22,781 --> 01:27:24,957
You see there was nothing
you could do then.

1205
01:27:27,438 --> 01:27:29,353
Think of the
possibilities now, Jack.

1206
01:27:32,617 --> 01:27:33,661
She could be there.

1207
01:27:35,968 --> 01:27:38,188
I too long to see my
Sophia once again, Jack.

1208
01:27:40,930 --> 01:27:43,584
- You're a crazy son
of a bitch, Alex.

1209
01:27:43,628 --> 01:27:46,849
- Jack, you know that
wasn't very nice.

1210
01:27:46,892 --> 01:27:47,675
It's kind of rude.

I'm not gonna kill ya.

What's gonna happen is you
and our new alien friend,

you're now going to be

We've gotta get out of here now.

Reports are in that space
pioneer and billionaire

1294
01:35:05,069 --> 01:35:09,160
Alexander Biggs left Earth
and departed for space

1295
01:35:09,204 --> 01:35:10,944
unexpectedly.

1296
01:35:10,988 --> 01:35:14,296
What has led to this
sudden departure?

1297
01:35:14,339 --> 01:35:16,428
And, why were none of
the agencies informed?

1298
01:35:18,038 --> 01:35:23,000
Has he discovered something
we're yet to find out?

1299
01:35:23,043 --> 01:35:25,176
Or, is he trying to get
away from something?

There are many questions
that need to be asked,

or is this just the end
of things as we know it.

Today, we're lucky to
have two whistle blowers.

Two whistle blowers
who worked so closely

with Alexander Biggs.

1305
01:35:43,368 --> 01:35:47,459

scratching their heads,

1307
01:35:50,723 --> 01:35:56,425
one that is about to change
life as you and me know it.

1308
01:35:56,468 --> 01:35:58,470
The questions need to be asked.

1309
01:36:00,037 --> 01:36:05,608
We're here now with one of
Alexander Biggs' top scientists.

1310
01:36:05,651 --> 01:36:08,001
You were with Biggs at
the time of the launch.

1311
01:36:08,045 --> 01:36:11,614
Can you please shed some
light into what is going on?

1312
01:36:16,358 --> 01:36:21,276
- I've worked for Alexander
Biggs for almost 15 years.

1313
01:36:23,321 --> 01:36:26,324
I was very proud and
excited to be able to work

1314
01:36:26,368 --> 01:36:28,152
for Biggs Aerospace.

1315
01:36:29,762 --> 01:36:34,724
But, it wasn't too long after
we acquired the specimen

1316
01:36:37,553 --> 01:36:42,471
that he exhibited a
behavior of ulterior motives

1317
01:36:42,514 --> 01:36:45,778
that was not for the
betterment of mankind.

1318
01:36:45,822 --> 01:36:48,390
- Could you go into a
little bit more detail?

1319
01:36:48,433 --> 01:36:52,524
- Well, there were
other subjects involved,

1320
01:36:52,568 --> 01:36:55,875
and we saw great
harm coming to them.

1321
01:36:55,919 --> 01:36:58,443
They were being
deceived, lied to,

1322
01:36:58,487 --> 01:37:03,535
and that's not what
we signed up for.

1323
01:37:05,537 --> 01:37:10,455
- Well, my son, technology
fascinated him, science, space.

1324
01:37:14,241 --> 01:37:15,852
He would always wonder
what's out there,

1325
01:37:15,895 --> 01:37:19,508
and he would always say to me,
"Dad I want to be like you.

1326
01:37:19,551 --> 01:37:21,118
"I want to be a scientist."

1327
01:37:21,161 --> 01:37:25,035
And, getting this job
at Biggs Aerospace

1328
01:37:25,078 --> 01:37:27,603
was a dream job,
a dream come true.

1329
01:37:27,646 --> 01:37:31,998
I hadn't spoken to him in
awhile until he called me,

1330
01:37:32,042 --> 01:37:34,392
and he said, "Dad, I love you."

1331
01:37:38,744 --> 01:37:40,180
I said I love you too, son.

1332
01:37:43,575 --> 01:37:46,404
He'd hoped that I'd
be proud of him.

1333
01:37:48,493 --> 01:37:50,626
I know this is hard for
you, so take your time.

1334
01:37:55,021 --> 01:37:57,328
- I wish I knew more
about what happned

1335
01:37:57,372 --> 01:37:59,722
and what was really in his mind.

1336
01:37:59,765 --> 01:38:03,334
That was one of the things
even when he was going up,

1337
01:38:03,378 --> 01:38:06,468
I couldn't never really
figure out my son.

1338
01:38:07,991 --> 01:38:12,822
So I wish I knew what he was
up to now and where he was.

1339
01:38:12,865 --> 01:38:14,780
- Dr. Rodgers and
I were on our own

1340
01:38:14,824 --> 01:38:19,350
when we realized that
Dr. Ramesh and Dr. Cope

1341
01:38:19,394 --> 01:38:22,701
launched off with Biggs.

1342
01:38:22,745 --> 01:38:28,533
And, then all hell
broke loose, the chaos.

1343
01:38:28,577 --> 01:38:30,579
We had one thing on
our mind was to be able

1344
01:38:30,622 --> 01:38:35,453
to stop this launch and
madness that was taking place.

1345

Feds coming in and
trying to remove us.

1346
01:38:41,285 --> 01:38:46,725
I saw some things that, I
mean he cryogenically froze

1347
01:38:46,769 --> 01:38:48,379
his own son.

1348
01:38:49,641 --> 01:38:53,384
I mean he started
to look non human.

1349
01:38:53,428 --> 01:38:56,648
His behavior was
just like a monster.

1350
01:38:56,692 --> 01:38:59,825
We discovered that there
was so many more secrets

1351
01:38:59,869 --> 01:39:01,914
that Biggs was
withholding from us

1352
01:39:01,958 --> 01:39:05,222
and basically withholding
from the world.

1353
01:39:06,702 --> 01:39:10,096
And, we who survived
really feel that it's time

1354
01:39:10,140 --> 01:39:15,014
for the government to open this
up and show full disclosure.

1355
01:39:18,801 --> 01:39:21,673
This is something that
will affect all of us.
