1
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,918
Help! Someone help me!

2
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,256
Is someone there?

3
00:01:40,341 --> 00:01:42,384
Hey!

4
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,721
Oh, shit, I'm probably dead.

5
00:01:46,805 --> 00:01:49,515
You're not dead.
-Who's that?

6
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,601
Who's that?

7
00:01:51,685 --> 00:01:54,395
There's no point in yelling,
I already tried that.

8
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,731
Turn on the lights!

9
00:01:56,815 --> 00:01:59,025
I would if I could.

10
00:01:59,108 --> 00:02:02,402
What the fuck is going on?
Where am I?

11
00:02:02,486 --> 00:02:06,031
-I don't know yet.
-What is that smell?

12
00:02:06,115 --> 00:02:10,285
Shh. Hang on a second.
I think I found something.

13
00:02:57,204 --> 00:02:58,579
Holy shit.

14
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,262
Aaaargh! Help!

15
00:03:18,556 --> 00:03:20,099
Help!

16
00:03:22,018 --> 00:03:23,644
Help!

17
00:03:24,896 --> 00:03:26,313
Help!

18
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:29,441
No-one can hear you.

19
00:03:29,525 --> 00:03:31,734
What the fuck is this?

20
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:35,488
Calm down. Just calm down.

21
00:03:35,572 --> 00:03:36,781
Are you hurt?

22
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,201
I don't know. Yeah!

23
00:03:40,284 --> 00:03:43,912
-What's your name?
-My name is Very Fucking Confused.

24
00:03:43,996 --> 00:03:46,623
What's your name?
What's going on here?

25
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:50,669
My name is Lawrence Gordon, I'm a doctor.
I just woke up here, like you.

26
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,846
Aaaargh!

27
00:04:03,223 --> 00:04:05,474
Recognize him?

28
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:07,184
No.

29
00:04:10,062 --> 00:04:12,105
Do you have any idea how you got here?

30
00:04:12,189 --> 00:04:13,940
No.

31
00:04:14,024 --> 00:04:16,901
-What's the last thing you remember?
-Nothing.

32
00:04:16,986 --> 00:04:21,364
I went to bed in my shit-hole apartment,
and woke up in an actual shit-hole.

33
00:04:24,367 --> 00:04:26,785
What about you, huh?

34
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:30,372
There's... There's not much to tell.

35
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,876
I was on my way home from work, and...

36
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,003
I don't remember anything else.

37
00:04:41,842 --> 00:04:43,843
First dead body I've ever seen.

38
00:04:44,969 --> 00:04:46,678
They look different in real life.

39
00:04:48,806 --> 00:04:50,849
They don't move.

40
00:04:55,563 --> 00:04:58,482
From the looks of these chains,

41
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:01,317
someone didn't want us
to go very far, either.

42
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:05,696
-Can you see any scars?
-What?

43
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,573
Man, they kidnap you and drug you.

44
00:05:07,657 --> 00:05:10,576
Before you know, you're in a bath
and your kidneys are on eBay.

45
00:05:10,659 --> 00:05:13,286
No-one has taken your kidneys.

46
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,080
How can you tell from way over there?

47
00:05:16,165 --> 00:05:19,500
You'd either be in terrible agony,
or you'd be dead by now.

48
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:20,960
Trust me.

49
00:05:21,045 --> 00:05:23,087
-What are you, a surgeon?
-Yeah.

50
00:05:26,507 --> 00:05:27,507
So...

51
00:05:29,052 --> 00:05:31,637
Are you gonna tell me
your name, or what?

52
00:05:35,099 --> 00:05:37,142
Adam.

53
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,353
Well, Adam...

54
00:05:41,688 --> 00:05:44,232
What we need to do...

55
00:05:44,316 --> 00:05:46,651
is start thinking about why we're here.

56
00:05:46,735 --> 00:05:50,279
Whoever brought us here
could have killed us by now.

57
00:05:50,363 --> 00:05:51,655
But they didn't.

58
00:05:52,573 --> 00:05:54,616
They must want something from us.

59
00:05:56,535 --> 00:05:58,578
The question is, what?

60
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:06,418
-That clock.
-What about it?

61
00:06:06,503 --> 00:06:09,463
-It's brand-new.
-So?

62
00:06:09,547 --> 00:06:13,467
So... somebody obviously
wanted us to know the time.

63
00:06:17,096 --> 00:06:20,306
Wait, I think I might be
able to reach the door.

64
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,206
What is that?

65
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:52,002
Excuse me.

66
00:06:52,087 --> 00:06:54,046
It's a tape.

67
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:57,048
-Where did you find it?
-It was in my pocket.

68
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:07,392
It says, "Play me. "

69
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,922
Come on. Come on.

70
00:07:43,801 --> 00:07:45,552
Throw it over here.

71
00:07:52,934 --> 00:07:54,685
Fuck.

72
00:08:06,071 --> 00:08:07,363
No?

73
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:36,891
-Use your shirt.
-What?

74
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:39,018
Your shirt.

75
00:08:52,864 --> 00:08:54,865
Come on.

76
00:08:59,996 --> 00:09:01,997
-It won't work.
-Look around.

77
00:09:02,082 --> 00:09:04,124
There must be something else you can use.

78
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:07,961
-There's nothing.
-Well, there must be something.

79
00:09:20,974 --> 00:09:23,016
Come on. You can do it.

80
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,022
Come on. Come on.

81
00:09:29,106 --> 00:09:30,398
Again.

82
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,463
Rise and shine, Adam.

83
00:09:55,547 --> 00:09:58,007
You're probably wondering where you are.

84
00:09:58,091 --> 00:10:00,592
I'll tell you where you might be.

85
00:10:00,677 --> 00:10:03,554
You might be in the room that you die in.

86
00:10:03,638 --> 00:10:09,560
Up until now, you've simply sat in the shadows,
watching others live out their lives.

87
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:13,938
But what do voyeurs see
when they look into the mirror?

88
00:10:14,022 --> 00:10:19,652
Now, I see you as a strange mix
of someone angry yet apathetic.

89
00:10:19,737 --> 00:10:21,738
But mostly just pathetic.

90
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:24,990
So, are you going to watch
yourself die today, Adam,

91
00:10:25,074 --> 00:10:27,117
or do something about it?

92
00:10:28,578 --> 00:10:30,620
I don't get it.

93
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:32,748
Throw me the player.

94
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:37,960
No. You throw me your tape.

95
00:10:39,296 --> 00:10:43,090
Look, we're gonna have to work together,
if we want to get out of here.

96
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:45,634
-Throw it to me.
-I'm not gonna risk breaking it.

97
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:47,762
You throw me your tape.

98
00:11:04,652 --> 00:11:06,653
Dr. Gordon...

99
00:11:06,738 --> 00:11:09,239
this is your wake-up call.

100
00:11:09,324 --> 00:11:13,160
Every day of your working life,
you have given people the news

101
00:11:13,243 --> 00:11:15,620
that they're gonna die soon.

102
00:11:15,704 --> 00:11:19,540
Now you will be the cause of death.

103
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:23,544
Your aim in this game is to kill Adam.

104
00:11:23,629 --> 00:11:25,713
You have until 6 on the clock to do it.

105
00:11:27,006 --> 00:11:29,591
There's a man in the room with you.

106
00:11:29,675 --> 00:11:32,260
When there's that much poison in your blood,

107
00:11:32,345 --> 00:11:35,931
the only thing left to do is shoot yourself.

108
00:11:41,978 --> 00:11:46,357
There are ways to win this,
hidden all around you.

109
00:11:46,441 --> 00:11:51,779
Just remember,
X marks the spot for the treasure.

110
00:11:51,862 --> 00:11:54,739
If you do not kill Adam by six,

111
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:59,619
then Alison and Diana will die,
Dr. Gordon.

112
00:12:00,704 --> 00:12:04,040
And I'll leave you in
this room to rot.

113
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,376
Let the game begin.

114
00:12:16,843 --> 00:12:18,844
Give me that.

115
00:12:18,929 --> 00:12:20,054
Now.

116
00:12:29,064 --> 00:12:32,483
Then Alison and Diana will die,
Dr. Gordon...

117
00:12:33,609 --> 00:12:36,444
...and I'll leave you in
this room to rot.

118
00:12:36,529 --> 00:12:41,700
-Any idea who that is?
-Let the game begin.

119
00:12:41,784 --> 00:12:45,453
-He knows us.
-Wait a minute.

120
00:12:45,537 --> 00:12:48,622
What do you think? Probably a joke, right?

121
00:12:48,707 --> 00:12:50,207
Shh!

122
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:53,544
-Let the game begin.
-Listen. Listen.

123
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:56,630
Follow your heart.

124
00:13:04,388 --> 00:13:06,639
What the hell does "follow your heart" mean?

125
00:13:13,229 --> 00:13:16,440
There, right next to you, on the toilet.

126
00:13:26,033 --> 00:13:29,035
Come on. Come on.

127
00:13:32,706 --> 00:13:34,749
Oh, man!

128
00:13:42,631 --> 00:13:45,383
-Anything?
-No solids.

129
00:13:45,468 --> 00:13:46,801
Take off the lid.

130
00:13:49,345 --> 00:13:50,971
Come on.

131
00:14:00,856 --> 00:14:03,107
I really wish I had've checked in there first.

132
00:14:03,192 --> 00:14:05,359
Huh! What is it?

133
00:14:34,262 --> 00:14:35,513
Hey.

134
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,599
Mind passing me the other one?

135
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,708
Fuck! Fuck!

136
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,751
He doesn't want us to cut through our chains.

137
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:57,630
He wants us to cut through our feet.

138
00:16:01,634 --> 00:16:03,844
I think I may know who's done this to us.

139
00:16:03,928 --> 00:16:06,346
What did you say?

140
00:16:06,431 --> 00:16:08,473
Well, it's not someone I know personally.

141
00:16:09,391 --> 00:16:11,017
It's just someone I know of.

142
00:16:12,102 --> 00:16:14,562
Jesus Christ! Tell me. Who is it?

143
00:16:17,024 --> 00:16:19,066
Last I heard...

144
00:16:20,277 --> 00:16:22,945
.. the police still hadn't caught him.

145
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:25,363
And the only reason I know that...

146
00:16:25,448 --> 00:16:27,490
is because I was a suspect.

147
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,953
I'll start from the beginning.

148
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:43,213
This one's not fresh any more.
At least three weeks out.

149
00:16:43,298 --> 00:16:46,550
Victim's a 46-year-old male.

150
00:16:48,093 --> 00:16:52,764
Died of massive blood loss,
mostly through the femoral artery.

151
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:59,896
He started at the back and tunneled
through that razor wire so fast,

152
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,023
it's amazing he got as far as he did.

153
00:17:04,192 --> 00:17:08,236
Cut himself so deep,
we found traces of stomach acid on the floor.

154
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:14,785
We also found this.

155
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:23,584
Hello, Paul. You are a
perfectly healthy, sane, middle-class male,

156
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:25,002
yet last month,

157
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:27,755
you ran a straight razor across your wrists.

158
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,634
Did you cut yourself
because you truly wanted to die,

159
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,345
or did you just want some attention?

160
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,972
Tonight, you'll show me.

161
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:41,017
The irony is that if you want to die,

162
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,519
you just have to stay where you are.

163
00:17:43,603 --> 00:17:46,188
If you want to live,
you'll have to cut yourself again.

164
00:17:46,272 --> 00:17:49,441
Find a path through the razor wire to the door.

165
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:50,859
But hurry.

166
00:17:52,028 --> 00:17:54,947
At three o'clock that door will lock.

167
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:57,532
And then this room becomes your tomb.

168
00:17:57,616 --> 00:18:00,952
How much blood will you shed
to stay alive, Paul?

169
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,959
Door was on a timer.
It was unlocked until three o'clock.

170
00:18:09,377 --> 00:18:12,837
Then it slammed shut. He was given two hours.

171
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:17,425
You sick fuck!

172
00:18:23,223 --> 00:18:24,932
A jigsaw piece.

173
00:18:29,813 --> 00:18:32,648
I think we're gonna be here for a while, Sing.

174
00:18:32,731 --> 00:18:36,442
The newspapers started
calling him "the jigsaw killer".

175
00:18:36,527 --> 00:18:39,862
Actually, technically speaking,

176
00:18:39,947 --> 00:18:43,491
he's... not really a murderer.

177
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:47,077
He never killed anyone.

178
00:18:47,161 --> 00:18:50,205
He finds ways for his victims
to kill themselves.

179
00:18:52,917 --> 00:18:56,086
Hello, Mark. If you're so sick,

180
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:59,381
then why do I have so many photos of you
up and about?

181
00:19:00,048 --> 00:19:03,342
Let's put your so-called illness to the test.

182
00:19:04,678 --> 00:19:08,556
Right now, there's a slow-acting
poison in your veins.

183
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,642
The antidote is inside the safe.

184
00:19:11,726 --> 00:19:12,767
Help!

185
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:17,981
The combination to the safe...
is written on the wall.

186
00:19:18,065 --> 00:19:20,150
Hurry up and program it in.

187
00:19:20,234 --> 00:19:22,360
But watch your step.

188
00:19:22,445 --> 00:19:27,699
By the way, that's a flammable substance
smeared on your body.

189
00:19:27,782 --> 00:19:30,993
So, I would be careful
with that candle, if I were you.

190
00:19:31,077 --> 00:19:36,832
Or all the people you've burned with your act
just might have their revenge.

191
00:19:41,336 --> 00:19:42,545
Aaaargh!

192
00:19:43,881 --> 00:19:45,256
I found something else.

193
00:19:46,383 --> 00:19:48,384
Well, two things, actually.

194
00:19:48,469 --> 00:19:51,721
There was someone standing outside,
watching through this hole.

195
00:19:51,804 --> 00:19:56,641
Our friend Jigsaw likes to book himself
front-row seats to his own sick little games.

196
00:19:56,726 --> 00:19:59,019
He was there at the last one as well.

197
00:20:00,146 --> 00:20:03,482
Only, this time... he left us his penlight.

198
00:20:07,402 --> 00:20:08,944
Hm...

199
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:12,031
Get a rush on the prints.

200
00:20:12,115 --> 00:20:14,492
Copy that.

201
00:20:14,576 --> 00:20:18,579
This patient has an inoperable frontal lobe
tumor extending across the midline.

202
00:20:18,662 --> 00:20:21,498
It started as colon cancer.

203
00:20:21,582 --> 00:20:24,834
The patient has come in for a standard checkup,

204
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:28,546
by which we can monitor the rate
at which his condition is declining.

205
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:31,048
-The patient had...
-His name is John.

206
00:20:32,258 --> 00:20:35,427
Dr. Gordon. He's a very interesting person.

207
00:20:38,139 --> 00:20:40,140
Thank you for that information, Zep.

208
00:20:40,225 --> 00:20:44,186
As you can see, our orderlies
form very special bonds with the patients.

209
00:20:45,521 --> 00:20:47,563
Continuing on, the patient had...

210
00:20:47,648 --> 00:20:50,483
Dr. Gordon, please page the operator.

211
00:20:52,027 --> 00:20:56,531
Someone doesn't want me to tell you
what the patient had! Excuse me.

212
00:21:01,285 --> 00:21:02,577
Dr. Gordon.

213
00:21:03,704 --> 00:21:06,915
I'm Detective Tapp, this is Detective Sing.
City homicide.

214
00:21:06,998 --> 00:21:11,710
-Very impressive.
-Oh, thank you.

215
00:21:11,795 --> 00:21:13,546
I do my best.

216
00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:18,676
-Sorry to interrupt you while you work.
-Fine.

217
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,803
Now, how can I help you gentlemen?

218
00:21:20,886 --> 00:21:26,766
Are you able to tell us where you were
between the hours of 11 PM and 1 AM last night?

219
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:29,727
Why is it that you're interested?

220
00:21:29,812 --> 00:21:32,230
We'd like to ask a few questions about it.

221
00:21:32,313 --> 00:21:36,984
For your sake, I think it's best
if we do it down at the station.

222
00:21:37,068 --> 00:21:41,697
-Would you like to follow us there?
-I'm afraid that's out of the question.

223
00:21:41,781 --> 00:21:46,076
I can't just leave, I have work to do.
Plus my wife has the car today.

224
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,494
That's OK. You can ride with us.

225
00:21:48,579 --> 00:21:49,912
Doc?

226
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:56,544
I'm sorry.

227
00:21:56,628 --> 00:22:00,298
You'll have to tell me again.
What is this all about?

228
00:22:01,424 --> 00:22:03,466
Is this yours, Doctor?

229
00:22:16,104 --> 00:22:19,648
So you have no idea how your penlight
showed up at the murder scene?

230
00:22:19,733 --> 00:22:21,775
Of course not, Brett.

231
00:22:25,195 --> 00:22:28,448
Well, I have to ask.
What were you doing last night?

232
00:22:31,368 --> 00:22:33,411
I was seeing someone.

233
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,414
Who?

234
00:22:40,084 --> 00:22:42,461
Look, if you can't be honest with me...

235
00:22:42,545 --> 00:22:44,588
I was visiting someone, It wasn't a patient.

236
00:22:44,672 --> 00:22:46,548
All right?

237
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:50,969
What am I gonna do?

238
00:22:51,053 --> 00:22:53,637
Well, as your lawyer and your friend,

239
00:22:53,722 --> 00:22:59,018
my advice to you is to bite the bullet
and give them your alibi now,

240
00:22:59,102 --> 00:23:01,270
cos no-one's gonna believe you later.

241
00:23:06,817 --> 00:23:08,860
That was five months ago.

242
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:14,532
He tried to set me up for murder.

243
00:23:18,411 --> 00:23:20,037
OK.

244
00:23:21,122 --> 00:23:23,499
We checked your alibi, It holds up.

245
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:26,752
Good. Can I go home now?

246
00:23:26,836 --> 00:23:30,130
We have one of the victims
who managed to escape.

247
00:23:30,214 --> 00:23:34,592
Want to know if you wouldn't mind sticking
around and listening to her testimony.

248
00:23:34,676 --> 00:23:36,677
Maybe it'll trigger something.

249
00:23:36,762 --> 00:23:40,848
-I'd like to help, really, but...
-Well, we'd appreciate it.

250
00:23:40,933 --> 00:23:43,434
-She's the only one who made it.
-OK.

251
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,066
Amanda...

252
00:23:52,151 --> 00:23:54,569
In your own time...

253
00:23:54,653 --> 00:23:57,321
tell me the first thing you remember.

254
00:24:11,585 --> 00:24:13,711
I woke up.

255
00:24:13,796 --> 00:24:15,964
All I could taste was blood.

256
00:24:17,675 --> 00:24:19,217
And metal.

257
00:24:48,411 --> 00:24:50,453
Hello, Amanda.

258
00:24:50,538 --> 00:24:54,457
You don't know me, but I know you.

259
00:24:54,542 --> 00:24:56,876
I want to play a game.

260
00:24:56,961 --> 00:24:59,921
Here's what happens if you lose.

261
00:25:00,005 --> 00:25:04,758
The device you're wearing
is hooked into your upper and lower jaws.

262
00:25:04,843 --> 00:25:07,219
When the timer on the back goes off,

263
00:25:07,304 --> 00:25:10,723
your mouth will be permanently ripped open.

264
00:25:10,807 --> 00:25:13,559
Think of it like a reverse bear trap.

265
00:25:14,602 --> 00:25:17,061
Here, I'll show you.

266
00:25:28,448 --> 00:25:31,867
There's only one key to open the device.

267
00:25:31,951 --> 00:25:35,495
It's in the stomach of your dead cellmate.

268
00:25:37,332 --> 00:25:38,915
Look around, Amanda.

269
00:25:38,999 --> 00:25:41,167
Know that I'm not lying.

270
00:25:41,251 --> 00:25:43,669
You'd better hurry up.

271
00:25:43,754 --> 00:25:45,796
Live or die.

272
00:25:45,881 --> 00:25:47,715
Make your choice.

273
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:07,733
No!

274
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:28,252
And then I saw the body.

275
00:26:50,857 --> 00:26:52,900
There was a knife.

276
00:27:25,973 --> 00:27:28,558
He'd been injected with an opiate overdose.

277
00:27:29,852 --> 00:27:32,186
Couldn't move or feel much of anything.

278
00:27:34,772 --> 00:27:37,315
You mean... he was alive?

279
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,608
Was.

280
00:27:40,361 --> 00:27:42,320
What happened after you took it off?

281
00:28:44,754 --> 00:28:48,089
Congratulations. You are still alive.

282
00:28:49,175 --> 00:28:52,719
Most people are so ungrateful to be alive.

283
00:28:52,802 --> 00:28:56,096
But not you. Not any more.

284
00:29:02,354 --> 00:29:06,357
You are, in fact, a drug addict.
Isn't that right, Mandy?

285
00:29:10,152 --> 00:29:12,653
Do you think that is why he picked you?

286
00:29:18,618 --> 00:29:20,660
Are you grateful, Mandy?

287
00:29:25,792 --> 00:29:29,461
He... helped me.

288
00:30:06,996 --> 00:30:09,039
Are you sure it's him?

289
00:30:10,165 --> 00:30:13,960
-Yeah, I'm sure.
-How do I know you're telling the truth?

290
00:30:14,044 --> 00:30:16,671
You could be the one who put me in this room!

291
00:30:16,755 --> 00:30:21,592
I'm in exactly the same situation you're in.

292
00:30:21,677 --> 00:30:24,971
Wrong. Wrong! You've got one thing I don't.

293
00:30:25,054 --> 00:30:27,180
Information. You know who did this.

294
00:30:29,392 --> 00:30:33,353
Now, you either tell me what is really going on,
or I'll cut you with this!

295
00:30:33,437 --> 00:30:35,480
I'll cu...

296
00:30:41,111 --> 00:30:43,612
-What?
-It's a two-way mirror.

297
00:31:13,433 --> 00:31:16,435
I can see you.

298
00:31:16,518 --> 00:31:20,104
So, that's what this is. Reality TV.

299
00:31:20,188 --> 00:31:22,815
Don't look at me, I can't help you.

300
00:31:22,899 --> 00:31:26,652
Can you hear me in there? Huh?
I'm having a blast.

301
00:31:26,736 --> 00:31:30,030
This is the most fun I've had without lubricant.

302
00:31:30,156 --> 00:31:32,949
Make sure you're getting everything.

303
00:31:35,077 --> 00:31:37,329
That's not gonna do anything.

304
00:31:39,372 --> 00:31:42,082
-You want to leave it running on us?
-You won't stop it.

305
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:46,462
That's why we can't cut through these chains
or why you won't break that glass.

306
00:31:46,546 --> 00:31:49,798
Every possible angle
has been pre-thought out by him.

307
00:31:49,883 --> 00:31:52,760
You make it sound like you admire this prick.

308
00:31:52,843 --> 00:31:56,596
To overcome something, you have to
understand what a perfect engine it is.

309
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,389
That's how you fight disease.

310
00:31:59,475 --> 00:32:02,894
The tape told us to find an X.

311
00:32:02,978 --> 00:32:06,481
That X has to be somewhere in this room.
Help me find it.

312
00:32:06,564 --> 00:32:09,941
How can you be the calm doctor when
your wife and kid are out there?

313
00:32:10,026 --> 00:32:12,736
He has them too.
He could be doing anything to them now.

314
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:17,032
-Are you thinking about that?
-I am thinking about that.

315
00:32:23,622 --> 00:32:26,791
I've been thinking about
the last thing I said to my daughter.

316
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:12,471
Diana, honey, are you OK?

317
00:34:14,515 --> 00:34:16,808
Diana, honey, can you hear me?

318
00:34:16,893 --> 00:34:20,312
-Mommy...
-What is it, sweet pea?

319
00:34:20,396 --> 00:34:23,023
There's a man in my room.

320
00:34:23,107 --> 00:34:26,693
Oh, honey, are you sure he's not
just hiding in your imagination?

321
00:34:26,777 --> 00:34:28,820
He talked to me.

322
00:34:30,238 --> 00:34:33,198
OK, I'll come and check your room.

323
00:34:33,283 --> 00:34:36,327
I want Daddy. He'll get the scary man.

324
00:34:37,954 --> 00:34:41,040
All right, if you want. Come on.

325
00:34:44,209 --> 00:34:48,338
Larry, sorry to bother you,
but your daughter had a bad dream again.

326
00:34:48,422 --> 00:34:49,839
Just a minute.

327
00:34:50,883 --> 00:34:53,301
She wants you to check her room.

328
00:34:53,384 --> 00:34:55,844
Mm-hm. Just got to finish this paragraph.

329
00:35:00,058 --> 00:35:02,392
Come on, sweetie, I'll check with you.

330
00:35:05,021 --> 00:35:06,563
Nope, I'm done.

331
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:11,567
See? There's no-one in your room.

332
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,946
There's no such thing as the Bad Man.

333
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:19,867
-Now can you go to sleep?
-I'm still scared.

334
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:22,243
You are? Give me your tootsie.

335
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:26,706
Oh, what a big tootsie.

336
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,000
Remember this one?

337
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:31,294
This little piggy went to market.

338
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,630
This little piggy stayed home.

339
00:35:33,713 --> 00:35:35,923
This little piggy had roast beef.

340
00:35:36,007 --> 00:35:38,133
This little piggy had none.

341
00:35:38,218 --> 00:35:40,344
This little piggy ran...

342
00:35:40,428 --> 00:35:43,347
Whee! All the way home!

343
00:35:46,308 --> 00:35:47,850
I hate that thing.

344
00:35:48,977 --> 00:35:51,312
Well, I have to go to work, sweetheart.

345
00:35:51,397 --> 00:35:54,148
You know what Daddy's job is like.
Now, come on.

346
00:35:55,526 --> 00:35:57,151
Let's see.

347
00:35:58,486 --> 00:36:00,445
Try and get some sleep, now, OK?

348
00:36:06,828 --> 00:36:10,288
You're not gonna leave us, are you, Daddy?

349
00:36:11,957 --> 00:36:13,999
What?

350
00:36:15,293 --> 00:36:17,169
What are you talking about?

351
00:36:17,921 --> 00:36:20,089
You mean, leave you and Mommy?

352
00:36:21,842 --> 00:36:24,552
No. No, sweetheart, I...

353
00:36:24,635 --> 00:36:26,678
I would never do that.

354
00:36:27,805 --> 00:36:30,932
-Who gave you that idea?
-No-one.

355
00:36:32,226 --> 00:36:34,602
Well, it's not true. OK?

356
00:36:35,855 --> 00:36:38,898
-OK.
-How much do I love you?

357
00:36:38,982 --> 00:36:41,942
-Love you very much.
-That's right. That's right.

358
00:36:43,403 --> 00:36:46,071
-Good night, sweetie.
-Good night, Daddy.

359
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:54,036
Tomorrow... I'll read you your favorite story.

360
00:36:54,121 --> 00:36:55,580
OK.

361
00:36:55,664 --> 00:36:58,499
I don't know
how much longer I can do this.

362
00:36:58,584 --> 00:37:01,669
-What are you talking about?
-How can you pretend you're happy?

363
00:37:01,753 --> 00:37:05,047
-I am happy.
-That is complete bullshit.

364
00:37:05,131 --> 00:37:07,424
I'd rather you just tell me you hate me.

365
00:37:07,508 --> 00:37:09,926
At least there would be some passion in it.

366
00:37:14,056 --> 00:37:16,099
Would you like to see her?

367
00:37:33,532 --> 00:37:36,159
-She's beautiful.
-Thank you.

368
00:37:37,536 --> 00:37:39,537
You gonna have any more kids?

369
00:37:39,622 --> 00:37:42,624
Ah, we've... talked about it, but er...

370
00:37:44,334 --> 00:37:46,877
.. with our schedules,

371
00:37:46,961 --> 00:37:49,504
it's difficult enough to concentrate on one.

372
00:37:50,632 --> 00:37:53,342
So, where's the lucky wife?

373
00:37:53,426 --> 00:37:56,678
There's another picture
behind the one you're looking at.

374
00:37:56,762 --> 00:38:01,265
It's my favorite one because...
we're all in it together.

375
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:04,894
Someone, usually me, has to hold the camera,

376
00:38:04,978 --> 00:38:08,022
which means I'm always missing
from the photos.

377
00:38:23,953 --> 00:38:27,331
It's er... It's not here.

378
00:38:27,415 --> 00:38:29,083
What?

379
00:38:29,167 --> 00:38:32,544
This photo you're talking about's not here.

380
00:38:32,628 --> 00:38:34,754
Really? Are you sure?

381
00:38:34,838 --> 00:38:36,881
Yeah. Just...

382
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:53,271
Why, he... he must have taken it, I...

383
00:38:53,356 --> 00:38:55,357
How can you pretend you're happy?

384
00:38:55,441 --> 00:38:59,236
-I am happy.
-That is complete bullshit.

385
00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:01,320
I'd rather you just tell me you hate me.

386
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:03,447
At least there would be some passion in it.

387
00:39:06,493 --> 00:39:08,536
We'll talk about this later. OK?

388
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,582
Just leave.

389
00:39:48,031 --> 00:39:50,324
Good night, little girl.

390
00:39:56,831 --> 00:39:57,539
Diana?

391
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:00,917
Diana?

392
00:40:04,754 --> 00:40:05,713
Diana!

393
00:40:16,473 --> 00:40:18,516
Mommy!

394
00:40:21,937 --> 00:40:23,980
Shh.

395
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,875
Don't you dare!

396
00:40:45,959 --> 00:40:47,960
Get away from her!

397
00:40:56,844 --> 00:40:58,178
Mommy!

398
00:41:08,063 --> 00:41:09,271
Mommy!

399
00:41:09,356 --> 00:41:12,650
Mommy! Mommy!

400
00:41:12,734 --> 00:41:15,486
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!

401
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:17,571
Get off of her!

402
00:41:44,263 --> 00:41:48,350
Oh, you little man! I see you.

403
00:41:52,229 --> 00:41:55,272
Does Dr. Gordon know
you're at home with his wife?

404
00:41:58,068 --> 00:42:00,111
I know you know something.

405
00:42:06,409 --> 00:42:08,493
What are you doing in there?

406
00:42:08,577 --> 00:42:12,414
Waiting for the doctor?
I'm waiting for the doctor, too.

407
00:42:14,874 --> 00:42:16,333
Huh!

408
00:42:24,884 --> 00:42:26,927
I never should have let you go.

409
00:42:36,061 --> 00:42:39,564
There was someone
standing outside here watching.

410
00:42:39,647 --> 00:42:41,481
I want to play a game.

411
00:42:43,067 --> 00:42:46,695
Jigsaw piece.
We're gonna be here for a while. Sing.

412
00:42:46,779 --> 00:42:48,822
Hello, Amanda.

413
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:54,952
Dr. Gordon, are you able to tell us
where were you last night?

414
00:42:55,036 --> 00:42:59,039
You have no idea how your penlight
showed up at the murder scene?

415
00:42:59,124 --> 00:43:01,917
-We checked your alibi, it holds up.
-Isn't that right?

416
00:43:02,002 --> 00:43:04,128
I never should have let you go.

417
00:43:09,216 --> 00:43:11,176
Here we are.

418
00:43:12,303 --> 00:43:14,220
That was er...

419
00:43:14,305 --> 00:43:16,723
quite an amazing story that poor woman told.

420
00:43:32,446 --> 00:43:33,654
Look, I'm...

421
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,451
I'm sorry I can't be of more help
to your investigation.

422
00:43:40,204 --> 00:43:43,080
You know, we arrested a dentist last week.

423
00:43:43,164 --> 00:43:45,332
He liked to play with kids a bit too much.

424
00:43:46,459 --> 00:43:48,168
He lived two blocks from here.

425
00:43:49,587 --> 00:43:54,216
The sewer lines run under this neighborhood,
too... Doctor.

426
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:21,282
Hello, Amanda.

427
00:44:21,366 --> 00:44:25,118
You don't know me, but I know you.

428
00:44:25,203 --> 00:44:29,414
I want to play a game.
Here's what happens if you lose.

429
00:44:32,377 --> 00:44:35,629
There's a timer at the back
of the device you're wearing.

430
00:44:35,712 --> 00:44:37,797
When the timer goes off...

431
00:44:41,551 --> 00:44:45,096
-I'll catch you guys down there.
-... like a reverse bear trap.

432
00:44:50,893 --> 00:44:52,477
I'll show you.

433
00:44:55,731 --> 00:44:59,150
-Hey, Tapp.
-Hmm?

434
00:44:59,235 --> 00:45:02,445
We're gonna go down to get a beer.
You want to come?

435
00:45:02,529 --> 00:45:04,321
I don't think so. But thanks, anyway.

436
00:45:04,406 --> 00:45:07,199
Well, you know, I always ask.

437
00:45:07,283 --> 00:45:09,827
-There is one key to open the device.
-Have fun.

438
00:45:09,911 --> 00:45:13,414
It's in the stomach of your dead cellmate.

439
00:45:13,497 --> 00:45:16,916
Hey, Tapp.
I don't mean for this to be disrespectful.

440
00:45:18,669 --> 00:45:21,546
Maybe you should find yourself a girlfriend.

441
00:45:24,258 --> 00:45:28,386
It's in the stomach of your dead cellmate.
Look around...

442
00:45:30,972 --> 00:45:34,349
Look around, Amanda. Know that I'm not lying.

443
00:45:35,476 --> 00:45:37,519
You'd better hurry up.

444
00:45:39,646 --> 00:45:41,689
Wait, wait, wait. Sing.

445
00:45:44,276 --> 00:45:46,068
-Get back here.
-What?

446
00:45:54,452 --> 00:45:55,452
What?

447
00:45:59,498 --> 00:46:01,458
Remember 118th Street?

448
00:46:04,086 --> 00:46:08,923
Er... K2K. That gang's territory
was only about four blocks.

449
00:46:09,007 --> 00:46:11,049
Now, listen to this.

450
00:46:25,022 --> 00:46:29,358
Check the records for all fire emergencies
in that area within the last two weeks.

451
00:46:29,443 --> 00:46:30,776
Go -right now.

452
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:31,943
Mmm!

453
00:46:32,028 --> 00:46:37,657
On Tuesday 17th, a fire alarm went off
in the rear wing of 213 Stygian Street.

454
00:46:37,742 --> 00:46:41,745
It's an old listing.
Used to be a mannequin factory.

455
00:46:41,829 --> 00:46:43,872
Think we have enough for a warrant, though?

456
00:46:43,955 --> 00:46:45,998
Who said anything about a warrant?

457
00:46:46,082 --> 00:46:47,499
Right now?

458
00:46:47,584 --> 00:46:49,335
Why not?

459
00:46:49,419 --> 00:46:51,086
Yeah, why not?

460
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:04,098
At least we'll have the cover of darkness.

461
00:47:04,183 --> 00:47:06,517
Yeah, well, so will anybody else.

462
00:47:52,727 --> 00:47:54,770
I got you.

463
00:48:46,485 --> 00:48:48,611
What the hell is this?

464
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:07,337
Shit.

465
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:19,140
Oh, fuck!

466
00:49:34,654 --> 00:49:37,114
Wait, Sing. Let's see what he's gonna do.

467
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:40,242
-Why? We fuckin' got him.
-We don't know what he looks like.

468
00:49:40,327 --> 00:49:43,120
-Let's see what he's gonna do.
-No fucking way.

469
00:49:43,205 --> 00:49:44,997
Fuck that, I'm gonna take him.

470
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,165
What the fuck? Shit!

471
00:50:32,625 --> 00:50:36,336
Awake already, Jeff?

472
00:50:37,379 --> 00:50:39,672
I need more-powerful tranquillizers next time.

473
00:50:39,756 --> 00:50:42,716
Don't cry, I've given your life a purpose.

474
00:50:43,843 --> 00:50:46,929
You're a test subject
for something greater than yourself.

475
00:50:47,013 --> 00:50:48,180
Freeze!

476
00:50:48,264 --> 00:50:50,766
-Hold it right there!
-Put your hands in the air!

477
00:50:58,941 --> 00:51:03,653
Now you'll make a choice.
In 20 seconds, the life of this man will be ended.

478
00:51:03,736 --> 00:51:05,404
-Get down here!
-Turn it off!

479
00:51:07,323 --> 00:51:09,366
Sing, stop that thing, I'm taking him down.

480
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:10,492
Fine.

481
00:51:10,576 --> 00:51:11,910
Move!

482
00:51:11,995 --> 00:51:14,079
-How do you turn it off?
-Tell him, asshole!

483
00:51:14,163 --> 00:51:16,665
One key will unlock it.
-Where is it?

484
00:51:16,748 --> 00:51:18,916
-It's in the box.
-Box?

485
00:51:21,128 --> 00:51:22,670
Fuck!

486
00:51:24,506 --> 00:51:27,758
-Which key? Which key?
-Tell him which key it is!

487
00:51:27,842 --> 00:51:30,135
-Time's running out.
-Shut up and get down here!

488
00:51:30,219 --> 00:51:31,469
Now, asshole!

489
00:51:32,972 --> 00:51:37,809
What's more important to you, Officer?
Arresting me or the life of a human being?

490
00:51:37,893 --> 00:51:42,188
Get down on your knees, asshole!
Hands behind your head!

491
00:51:42,272 --> 00:51:44,898
-Tapp!
-Sick bastard!

492
00:51:44,983 --> 00:51:48,861
-Yes, I'm sick, Officer.
-Tapp, there's a hundred keys here!

493
00:51:48,945 --> 00:51:51,572
Sick from the disease eating away at me inside.

494
00:51:51,656 --> 00:51:55,284
Sick of people
who don't appreciate their blessings.

495
00:51:55,367 --> 00:51:58,286
Sick of those who scoff at the suffering of others.

496
00:52:01,874 --> 00:52:03,374
I'm sick of 'em all!

497
00:52:04,501 --> 00:52:05,418
Tapp!

498
00:52:14,552 --> 00:52:17,012
No! No! Tapp! Tapp!

499
00:52:17,096 --> 00:52:20,140
Shit! You're OK. Let me see.

500
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:26,312
I'll be back, I'm gonna be back, OK? I'll be back.

501
00:52:59,051 --> 00:53:01,093
Freeze, or I'll shoot!

502
00:54:31,469 --> 00:54:33,470
I had you.

503
00:54:33,555 --> 00:54:35,973
I had you on your knees.

504
00:54:36,057 --> 00:54:39,018
But you're running. You're running.

505
00:54:41,021 --> 00:54:43,605
You're running scared cos...
cos we had you.

506
00:54:45,024 --> 00:54:47,066
We're gonna close this case.

507
00:54:48,485 --> 00:54:51,237
Gonna close it. Right, Sing? Right?

508
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:53,364
We're gonna close it, Sing.

509
00:55:01,539 --> 00:55:05,333
"X" marks the spot.
"X" marks the spot.

510
00:55:06,335 --> 00:55:08,336
We need to search this room again.

511
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:10,421
What are you doing over there?

512
00:55:12,674 --> 00:55:14,049
Excuse me.

513
00:55:14,134 --> 00:55:16,302
Just because I'm stuck in this room with you

514
00:55:16,386 --> 00:55:19,472
doesn't mean I have to report
to you every 10 seconds.

515
00:55:20,556 --> 00:55:23,933
I really don't see the point
in us not helping one another.

516
00:55:25,019 --> 00:55:27,228
What do you want me to do? I'm on a leash.

517
00:55:27,313 --> 00:55:29,564
That's exactly why we need to talk and think.

518
00:55:29,648 --> 00:55:32,859
-I am thinking!
-Then don't keep me in the dark

519
00:55:32,943 --> 00:55:34,986
about what you're thinking!

520
00:55:38,531 --> 00:55:40,157
Turn off the lights.

521
00:55:40,241 --> 00:55:41,575
What?

522
00:55:42,702 --> 00:55:44,578
Turn them off now, please.

523
00:55:44,662 --> 00:55:47,498
-Why?
-Just turn them off for a second.

524
00:56:02,845 --> 00:56:04,471
Jesus. Behind you.

525
00:56:08,809 --> 00:56:11,019
How come we didn't see that before?

526
00:56:11,103 --> 00:56:15,065
The lights in here hadn't charged it.
It's glow-in-the-dark paint or something.

527
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:57,979
-Open it!
-It's locked.

528
00:56:59,106 --> 00:57:02,233
The key... the one from my envelope.
Where is it?

529
00:57:06,237 --> 00:57:08,738
Where the fuck? Here.

530
00:57:37,099 --> 00:57:38,349
A cellphone.

531
00:57:38,434 --> 00:57:40,727
The most beautiful invention on this planet.

532
00:57:46,024 --> 00:57:48,734
Make that second-most beautiful invention.

533
00:57:48,818 --> 00:57:50,402
Give me that.

534
00:57:50,486 --> 00:57:55,198
Are you joking? You're going to put something
you found in this room in your mouth?

535
00:57:55,282 --> 00:57:57,742
Yes, I'm willing to risk it.

536
00:57:57,826 --> 00:57:59,493
Give me that sweet cancer.

537
00:58:00,746 --> 00:58:03,664
I don't care, I really don't.

538
00:58:03,749 --> 00:58:05,750
Give me one of those.

539
00:58:05,834 --> 00:58:08,377
The cigarettes
are harmless, I promise.

540
00:58:08,461 --> 00:58:14,382
Smoking is only poisonous when it ends
in bloodshed. Think about this.

541
00:58:14,467 --> 00:58:16,468
You don't need a gun to kill Adam.

542
00:58:16,552 --> 00:58:19,137
May I please have a cigarette?

543
00:58:20,598 --> 00:58:22,640
I'm trying the police.

544
00:58:31,941 --> 00:58:33,984
Shit.

545
00:58:35,486 --> 00:58:38,237
This was meant to receive calls, not make them.

546
00:58:40,532 --> 00:58:42,325
Wait a minute.

547
00:58:42,409 --> 00:58:44,452
This has happened before.

548
00:58:48,372 --> 00:58:51,875
Last night, after I finished at the hospital...

549
00:58:54,378 --> 00:58:56,421
...I was walking back to my car.

550
00:58:58,341 --> 00:59:00,383
I thought I was alone, but...

551
00:59:01,468 --> 00:59:03,511
...I'm sure someone else was there.

552
00:59:46,510 --> 00:59:47,927
Great.

553
01:00:31,634 --> 01:00:36,054
That... thing... was waiting for me.

554
01:00:46,064 --> 01:00:48,733
How did you know to turn off the lights?

555
01:00:48,817 --> 01:00:51,986
-Who cares? It worked.
-Yeah, but how did you know?

556
01:00:52,070 --> 01:00:53,654
Instinct.

557
01:00:53,739 --> 01:00:55,114
Instinct?

558
01:00:55,198 --> 01:00:56,991
-Yeah.
-You know what?

559
01:00:58,117 --> 01:00:59,784
You're a terrible liar.

560
01:00:59,869 --> 01:01:02,495
You say that like you know me.

561
01:01:03,581 --> 01:01:05,582
What else aren't you telling me?

562
01:01:05,666 --> 01:01:08,293
Well, um, let's see...

563
01:01:09,419 --> 01:01:12,546
On my sixth birthday, my best friend at the time,
Scott Tibbs,

564
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:15,090
stabbed me with a rusty nail -
I didn't tell you that.

565
01:01:15,175 --> 01:01:18,052
My last girlfriend, a feminist vegan punk,

566
01:01:18,136 --> 01:01:20,596
broke up with me because I was too angry.

567
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:24,308
-One of my toenails is slightly...
-Just stop it!

568
01:01:25,434 --> 01:01:27,560
You knew to turn off these lights.

569
01:01:27,644 --> 01:01:30,646
-Whatever.
-I'm dealing with a juvenile.

570
01:01:31,774 --> 01:01:34,567
-You wanna know?
-Yeah!

571
01:01:36,235 --> 01:01:37,944
Here it is.

572
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:50,706
Come.

573
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:54,919
Oh, God.

574
01:02:00,758 --> 01:02:02,884
W-Where did you get this?

575
01:02:02,968 --> 01:02:05,345
It was in your wallet.

576
01:02:05,429 --> 01:02:07,430
Behind the photo of your daughter.

577
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:11,392
-Why didn't you show me this before?
-I couldn't.

578
01:02:15,939 --> 01:02:17,314
I'm sorry.

579
01:02:28,492 --> 01:02:30,701
What are you doing to them, you bastard?

580
01:02:39,169 --> 01:02:41,420
OK. OK.

581
01:02:42,505 --> 01:02:44,548
OK, I've got to think now.

582
01:02:47,301 --> 01:02:49,302
Think about this -

583
01:02:49,387 --> 01:02:51,846
you don't need a gun to kill Adam.

584
01:02:53,181 --> 01:02:55,724
When there's that much poison in your blood,

585
01:02:55,809 --> 01:02:59,019
the only thing left to do is shoot yourself.

586
01:03:32,968 --> 01:03:35,011
What are you doing?

587
01:03:41,727 --> 01:03:45,062
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

588
01:03:46,188 --> 01:03:49,441
Shh. Adam, listen to me.

589
01:03:49,525 --> 01:03:51,735
I want you to play along with me on this.

590
01:03:59,659 --> 01:04:01,994
You got that?

591
01:04:14,214 --> 01:04:17,091
So, you er... You still want that cigarette?

592
01:04:17,176 --> 01:04:20,261
Um... yeah.

593
01:04:20,345 --> 01:04:22,388
Sure.

594
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:33,119
There! I've done it!

595
01:05:34,205 --> 01:05:36,498
I've killed him with the poison like you wanted!

596
01:05:36,582 --> 01:05:38,625
Now where's my family?

597
01:05:38,709 --> 01:05:40,168
Where are they?

598
01:05:44,422 --> 01:05:45,589
Aaaargh!

599
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:51,804
-Aagh! Jesus Christ!
-What are you...?

600
01:05:51,888 --> 01:05:54,932
I-I-I just got electrocuted!

601
01:05:55,015 --> 01:05:57,016
What?

602
01:05:57,101 --> 01:05:59,602
Jesus. That was our way out!

603
01:05:59,687 --> 01:06:02,480
Did you hear what I said? Get this thing off me!

604
01:06:02,565 --> 01:06:04,899
-Get it off!
-Stop acting!

605
01:06:04,984 --> 01:06:09,237
You think I would make that up just to mess up
your stupid fucking charade?

606
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:10,946
All right, that's it.

607
01:06:26,503 --> 01:06:28,504
Damn it!

608
01:06:34,093 --> 01:06:36,136
I remember everything now.

609
01:06:38,347 --> 01:06:40,599
I remember how I got here.

610
01:08:12,101 --> 01:08:14,143
Oh...

611
01:08:28,490 --> 01:08:30,908
Great.

612
01:09:00,937 --> 01:09:02,688
Is someone there?

613
01:09:14,241 --> 01:09:16,284
I can hear you.

614
01:09:47,313 --> 01:09:49,355
Huh!

615
01:09:51,483 --> 01:09:53,026
What the...?

616
01:09:56,030 --> 01:09:58,072
What the Christ...?

617
01:10:06,873 --> 01:10:09,207
What the...?

618
01:10:13,962 --> 01:10:16,005
Huh!

619
01:10:17,090 --> 01:10:19,091
Who is that?

620
01:10:19,176 --> 01:10:21,886
Who's in there?

621
01:10:21,970 --> 01:10:23,971
Come out!

622
01:10:24,056 --> 01:10:26,098
I'll kill you, you motherfucker!

623
01:10:42,113 --> 01:10:42,863
Aagh!

624
01:11:09,263 --> 01:11:11,014
Who is this?

625
01:11:11,099 --> 01:11:13,475
Daddy?

626
01:11:13,559 --> 01:11:14,810
Diana.

627
01:11:14,894 --> 01:11:16,978
Daddy, is that you?

628
01:11:18,105 --> 01:11:20,773
Yeah, baby, it's me, I'm here.

629
01:11:20,857 --> 01:11:23,275
I-I'm scared, Daddy.

630
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:26,487
Don't worry, honey. Everything's gonna be OK.

631
01:11:26,571 --> 01:11:30,282
-Where's Mommy?
-She's here with me.

632
01:11:30,366 --> 01:11:32,492
Let me talk to her, sweetie.

633
01:11:32,576 --> 01:11:34,661
OK? Put Mommy on.

634
01:11:34,745 --> 01:11:38,123
The bad man from my room is here.

635
01:11:38,207 --> 01:11:41,084
He has us tied up...

636
01:11:41,168 --> 01:11:43,419
And he has a gun.

637
01:11:43,503 --> 01:11:46,255
Wh-What man?

638
01:11:46,339 --> 01:11:48,382
Please come home, Daddy.

639
01:11:49,801 --> 01:11:50,801
Hello?

640
01:11:51,928 --> 01:11:52,928
Hello?

641
01:11:53,972 --> 01:11:54,972
Diana?

642
01:11:56,098 --> 01:11:57,265
Diana?

643
01:11:58,475 --> 01:11:59,934
Diana!

644
01:12:03,438 --> 01:12:04,438
Larry.

645
01:12:04,523 --> 01:12:07,733
Ali? Is that you?

646
01:12:07,817 --> 01:12:09,860
Is Adam there?

647
01:12:11,737 --> 01:12:13,321
Well, how do you know...

648
01:12:14,448 --> 01:12:15,949
Ali...

649
01:12:17,034 --> 01:12:19,035
What is going on?

650
01:12:20,162 --> 01:12:22,080
Don't believe Adam's lies.

651
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:27,418
He knows you.
He knew all about you before today.

652
01:12:31,631 --> 01:12:33,716
Hello? Ali?

653
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,634
Ali?

654
01:12:37,928 --> 01:12:39,387
Hello!

655
01:12:39,471 --> 01:12:41,472
Goddamn you!

656
01:12:41,557 --> 01:12:44,934
If you so much as lay a finger on them,
I'll kill you.

657
01:12:45,019 --> 01:12:47,604
You hear me, you son of a bitch? I'll kill you!

658
01:12:54,152 --> 01:12:55,819
Damn!

659
01:12:56,904 --> 01:12:59,323
Are they OK?

660
01:13:02,492 --> 01:13:05,911
My wife, she er... She mentioned your name.

661
01:13:08,332 --> 01:13:10,374
What did she say?

662
01:13:12,085 --> 01:13:14,211
She told me...

663
01:13:14,295 --> 01:13:16,379
not to believe you.

664
01:13:17,506 --> 01:13:19,132
Believe me about what?

665
01:13:21,927 --> 01:13:24,387
She told me you knew me.

666
01:13:28,767 --> 01:13:30,434
Who are you?

667
01:13:31,561 --> 01:13:33,562
You know who I am.

668
01:13:33,646 --> 01:13:37,483
Stop the lies! You're a liar!
I need to know the truth!

669
01:13:40,027 --> 01:13:42,070
I'm a liar?

670
01:13:43,155 --> 01:13:45,365
What did you do last night, Lawrence?

671
01:13:46,450 --> 01:13:49,035
Work at a hospital, saving sick children?

672
01:13:49,119 --> 01:13:51,871
You told me
that after you left your house last night,

673
01:13:51,954 --> 01:13:53,955
you went to work at a hospital.

674
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:57,334
-That's because it's the truth.
-No, it's not.

675
01:13:57,418 --> 01:13:59,628
Your wife is right, Larry.

676
01:14:00,755 --> 01:14:04,508
You don't recall getting your picture taken
in that parking lot?

677
01:14:22,149 --> 01:14:25,360
I can prove that you didn't go anywhere near
a hospital last night.

678
01:14:33,243 --> 01:14:35,744
It's not the first time I've done it either, Larry.

679
01:14:35,829 --> 01:14:38,288
I've been taking pictures of you for days now.

680
01:14:44,878 --> 01:14:47,004
-Why?
-You want to know what I do?

681
01:14:47,089 --> 01:14:49,590
I get paid to take pictures of rich guys like you,

682
01:14:49,675 --> 01:14:52,093
who go to seedy motels to fuck their secretaries.

683
01:14:52,177 --> 01:14:54,804
Last night, I went to your house.

684
01:14:54,888 --> 01:14:57,140
and watched you leave.

685
01:14:57,223 --> 01:14:58,640
I followed you...

686
01:15:00,143 --> 01:15:01,893
...all the way to that shit-bag hotel.

687
01:15:05,773 --> 01:15:08,859
You've er... had these with you the whole time?

688
01:15:08,942 --> 01:15:11,861
I found them in there with the hacksaws.

689
01:15:12,904 --> 01:15:14,864
I don't know how they got there.

690
01:15:14,948 --> 01:15:20,744
-Right! You're so full of it!
-Face it, Larry, we're both bullshitters!

691
01:15:20,829 --> 01:15:23,622
But my camera isn't. It doesn't know how to lie.

692
01:15:23,706 --> 01:15:26,666
It only shows you what's put right in front of it.

693
01:15:26,750 --> 01:15:29,919
Just out of curiosity,
what did you do in that motel room?

694
01:15:30,004 --> 01:15:32,463
You got out of there pretty fast.

695
01:15:41,097 --> 01:15:43,098
Why did you um...

696
01:15:43,182 --> 01:15:46,268
deem it necessary to page me
when you knew I was at home?

697
01:15:47,352 --> 01:15:49,395
I didn't know if you were going to make it.

698
01:15:51,565 --> 01:15:54,275
I gave you a precise time at which to page me.

699
01:15:55,444 --> 01:15:57,194
You can't do that.

700
01:15:57,279 --> 01:16:00,072
It's not like I know the rules for this sort of stuff.

701
01:16:04,285 --> 01:16:07,996
-What's wrong, Dr. Gordon?
-Look, um...

702
01:16:09,498 --> 01:16:11,708
It was wrong of me to make you come here.

703
01:16:11,792 --> 01:16:15,462
-But I thought we've...
-No, no. Please.

704
01:16:17,547 --> 01:16:18,756
I'm sorry.

705
01:16:31,935 --> 01:16:33,936
You tell anyone you were here?

706
01:16:34,021 --> 01:16:35,563
No.

707
01:16:46,699 --> 01:16:48,742
Hello.

708
01:16:52,913 --> 01:16:55,373
-It's for you.
-For me?

709
01:17:09,512 --> 01:17:10,512
Hello.

710
01:17:12,515 --> 01:17:16,184
I know what you're doing... Doctor.

711
01:17:18,228 --> 01:17:20,270
I...

712
01:17:30,489 --> 01:17:32,490
I have to go.

713
01:17:32,574 --> 01:17:34,826
-What happened?
-I gotta go.

714
01:17:53,177 --> 01:17:54,678
Who was it?

715
01:17:54,762 --> 01:17:56,388
Who was what?

716
01:17:56,471 --> 01:17:59,640
The person who paid you to follow me.
Who was it?

717
01:17:59,724 --> 01:18:03,769
He calls himself Bob and he gives me
the money upfront. 200 bucks a night.

718
01:18:03,854 --> 01:18:06,564
If I'd known I'd end up here,
I'd have asked for a lot more.

719
01:18:06,648 --> 01:18:09,692
What does that mean?
Does that mean you saw what happened to me?

720
01:18:09,775 --> 01:18:12,735
What I saw was you get into your car. That's it.

721
01:18:12,820 --> 01:18:16,322
I didn't ask your name.
I didn't know who you were.

722
01:18:16,407 --> 01:18:19,993
I don't know how I got here.
I don't know how you got here.

723
01:18:20,077 --> 01:18:23,413
I took the shots and went straight home
to develop them.

724
01:18:23,496 --> 01:18:26,373
Next thing I know, I'm chained to a pipe

725
01:18:26,457 --> 01:18:30,085
in some prehistoric bathroom, staring at
the guy I've been taking shots of.

726
01:18:30,170 --> 01:18:34,339
Clearly, whoever paid you to take pictures of me
is the one who put us here.

727
01:18:34,424 --> 01:18:35,424
Maybe.

728
01:18:35,507 --> 01:18:37,550
Of course it is! What did he look like?

729
01:18:37,634 --> 01:18:39,802
-Just a guy.
-Was he tall? Skinny? Obese?

730
01:18:39,887 --> 01:18:42,972
-I don't take notes.
-You must remember something about him.

731
01:18:43,056 --> 01:18:45,600
-I can't.
-You don't remember a thing about the guy?

732
01:18:45,684 --> 01:18:48,311
-I told you, I...
-For fuck's sake! I give up!

733
01:18:48,394 --> 01:18:51,646
He's a tall black guy.
He's got a scar around his neck, OK?

734
01:19:02,365 --> 01:19:03,365
Tapp.

735
01:19:06,703 --> 01:19:09,997
-Detective Tapp.
-Whoa.

736
01:19:10,081 --> 01:19:13,208
The guy who paid me to take these photos
was not a cop.

737
01:19:13,293 --> 01:19:16,211
No, no. He was discharged from the police force.

738
01:19:16,295 --> 01:19:18,796
He broke down after his partner was killed.

739
01:19:18,881 --> 01:19:22,175
But that didn't stop him harassing me.
The guy became obsessed.

740
01:19:22,259 --> 01:19:25,720
He's convinced I must have somehow
been involved with the murders.

741
01:19:25,804 --> 01:19:28,431
He's crazy. And you helped him.

742
01:19:28,514 --> 01:19:32,309
You took money from him to invade my privacy.

743
01:19:32,393 --> 01:19:34,311
How could you do that?

744
01:19:34,395 --> 01:19:37,064
-Call it my need to eat.
-Right.

745
01:19:37,148 --> 01:19:40,984
Right. You know what, Adam,
you're not a victim of this game.

746
01:19:41,068 --> 01:19:43,027
-You're part of it.
-Oh, really?

747
01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:45,613
This cop thinks you're the one behind it all.

748
01:19:45,697 --> 01:19:49,367
I told you, he's not a cop.
He's a bottom feeder, just like you!

749
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:52,286
What are you pissed off about?
The fact I took shots of you

750
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:55,748
or the fact that I took shots of you
while you cheated on your wife?

751
01:19:55,831 --> 01:19:59,459
-I did not cheat on her!
-What do you care what I think anyway?

752
01:19:59,543 --> 01:20:04,631
I don't give a crap if you covered yourself in
peanut butter and had a 15-hooker gangbang.

753
01:20:19,269 --> 01:20:22,021
How did I get here? I had...

754
01:20:22,106 --> 01:20:23,940
I had everything in order.

755
01:20:26,068 --> 01:20:28,403
My whole life was in perfect order.

756
01:20:56,012 --> 01:20:58,347
Sweetheart, are you OK?

757
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:05,937
Mommy just needs you to be
really, really, really, really strong right now.

758
01:21:07,022 --> 01:21:10,066
I'm not gonna let anybody hurt you.

759
01:21:11,192 --> 01:21:12,985
You got that?

760
01:21:13,069 --> 01:21:15,737
OK. That's my good girl.

761
01:21:38,759 --> 01:21:42,929
Hey, was there someone else
at your house last night.

762
01:21:43,014 --> 01:21:45,015
besides your wife and daughter?

763
01:21:45,099 --> 01:21:47,767
-No.
-Well, there's someone here.

764
01:22:05,034 --> 01:22:07,035
I know him.

765
01:22:07,119 --> 01:22:09,704
-Zep.
-Who?

766
01:22:09,788 --> 01:22:13,750
His name is Zep. He's an orderly at my hospital.

767
01:22:13,834 --> 01:22:15,418
Zep.

768
01:22:15,501 --> 01:22:17,586
You perverted little psychopath.

769
01:22:17,670 --> 01:22:22,132
I'm gonna take great pleasure
in seeing you pay for this,

770
01:22:22,216 --> 01:22:24,259
you bastard fuck!

771
01:22:27,512 --> 01:22:28,512
Look.

772
01:22:35,395 --> 01:22:38,314
We're out of time.

773
01:22:57,082 --> 01:23:01,043
Shh, sweetie... sweetie.

774
01:23:01,127 --> 01:23:03,420
-Mommy, help me!
-Ssh...

775
01:23:20,687 --> 01:23:23,271
Dr. Gordon's time is up.

776
01:23:24,816 --> 01:23:27,943
Now I've got to do what I've got to do, and...

777
01:23:29,028 --> 01:23:32,364
.. I'm afraid it has to be you
that tells him he failed.

778
01:23:44,209 --> 01:23:45,918
Is that you, Zep, you bastard?

779
01:23:46,001 --> 01:23:48,378
I know it's you, you son of a bitch!

780
01:23:48,462 --> 01:23:50,463
La... Larry.

781
01:23:50,548 --> 01:23:52,090
Ali?

782
01:23:52,174 --> 01:23:53,883
You failed.

783
01:23:56,220 --> 01:23:57,220
Hello?

784
01:23:58,054 --> 01:23:58,929
Hello?

785
01:24:00,932 --> 01:24:03,100
-You!
-Wait.

786
01:24:05,895 --> 01:24:09,231
Don't move! Stay on the ground.

787
01:24:09,315 --> 01:24:11,191
Give me... Give me the phone.

788
01:24:12,317 --> 01:24:14,235
Give it to me!

789
01:24:25,746 --> 01:24:26,830
Larry?

790
01:24:26,914 --> 01:24:29,541
Ali! Honey, are you all right?

791
01:24:29,625 --> 01:24:32,752
No... No, we're not. Get down!

792
01:24:33,838 --> 01:24:36,840
-Larry, where are you?
-I don't know.

793
01:24:36,923 --> 01:24:39,425
I'm being held captive in a room somewhere.

794
01:24:39,509 --> 01:24:42,219
Wh-What are you talking about?

795
01:24:43,346 --> 01:24:45,639
-I'm so sorry, Ali.
-Honey, we need you here.

796
01:24:45,724 --> 01:24:48,017
So sorry for everything. It's my fault.

797
01:24:48,101 --> 01:24:50,603
Forgive me, I've always been happy with you.

798
01:24:50,686 --> 01:24:51,394
Mommy!

799
01:24:52,479 --> 01:24:54,689
Aagh!

800
01:24:54,773 --> 01:24:55,607
Jesus!

801
01:24:58,027 --> 01:24:59,027
Ali!

802
01:25:15,834 --> 01:25:17,668
Mommy!

803
01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:22,340
Ali! Ali!

804
01:25:23,675 --> 01:25:24,717
Mommy!

805
01:25:31,265 --> 01:25:33,141
Aargh! Aaargh!

806
01:25:40,232 --> 01:25:41,149
Freeze!

807
01:25:51,743 --> 01:25:53,577
Oh, no!

808
01:25:57,748 --> 01:26:00,166
What the fuck?

809
01:26:01,335 --> 01:26:03,419
-Yaaaa!
-Ya!

810
01:26:16,933 --> 01:26:19,393
Argh! Urgh!

811
01:26:26,608 --> 01:26:28,651
Mrs. Gordon?

812
01:26:31,446 --> 01:26:33,489
Diana!

813
01:26:37,576 --> 01:26:40,120
I'm gonna kill your husband now, Mrs. Gordon.

814
01:27:09,606 --> 01:27:10,440
Lawrence!

815
01:27:15,778 --> 01:27:17,487
Lawrence, get up!

816
01:27:29,207 --> 01:27:31,208
Lawrence! Get up!

817
01:27:32,752 --> 01:27:33,961
I need you!

818
01:27:47,516 --> 01:27:51,019
Oh, thank God, I thought you were dead.

819
01:27:56,357 --> 01:27:58,525
He... He... He electrocuted me.

820
01:27:59,277 --> 01:28:02,905
I told you.
The same thing happened to me. See?

821
01:28:02,989 --> 01:28:05,115
I wasn't lying. See?

822
01:28:05,199 --> 01:28:07,116
Fuck this shit!

823
01:29:15,013 --> 01:29:16,847
No!

824
01:29:18,892 --> 01:29:20,685
Lawrence, calm down.

825
01:29:20,769 --> 01:29:22,979
-There must be a way out of this.
-Shut up!

826
01:29:23,062 --> 01:29:26,648
Just shut up! My family needs me!

827
01:29:28,067 --> 01:29:30,485
No! God!

828
01:29:30,569 --> 01:29:32,570
God! No!

829
01:29:32,655 --> 01:29:34,072
Argh!

830
01:29:39,119 --> 01:29:41,662
Lawrence! I have a family too.

831
01:29:41,746 --> 01:29:45,666
I don't see them, that's my mistake.
It's a mistake I'd like to fix.

832
01:29:50,295 --> 01:29:52,880
I'm gonna kill you, you sick asshole.

833
01:29:54,842 --> 01:29:55,967
Lawrence!

834
01:29:57,052 --> 01:29:58,344
Stop it.

835
01:30:02,890 --> 01:30:04,891
Lawrence, just calm down.

836
01:30:04,976 --> 01:30:07,602
There's a way out of here.
There's a way out!

837
01:30:07,687 --> 01:30:08,562
Lawrence!

838
01:30:10,648 --> 01:30:12,649
No! What are you... No!

839
01:30:12,733 --> 01:30:15,276
Oh, my God! Lawrence!

840
01:30:17,237 --> 01:30:19,655
What are you doing?

841
01:31:31,430 --> 01:31:33,473
What... are you doing?

842
01:31:55,328 --> 01:31:57,621
What are you... What are you...

843
01:31:59,373 --> 01:32:01,457
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

844
01:32:04,002 --> 01:32:06,003
Lawrence, don't! No!

845
01:32:06,088 --> 01:32:08,089
No, Lawrence, please!

846
01:32:08,173 --> 01:32:10,591
I'm begging you!

847
01:32:10,675 --> 01:32:13,301
Lawrence! It's not me who did this to you!

848
01:32:14,562 --> 01:32:16,939
-You have to die.
-No! I want to live!

849
01:32:17,023 --> 01:32:19,024
-I'm sorry.
-I want to live!

850
01:32:19,109 --> 01:32:21,443
-My family...
-Argh!

851
01:32:34,956 --> 01:32:37,749
There! I've done it!

852
01:32:38,876 --> 01:32:40,919
Now show them to me!

853
01:32:44,299 --> 01:32:46,341
Show them to me.

854
01:32:46,426 --> 01:32:48,719
-Thank you very much, Officer.
-Larry?

855
01:32:48,802 --> 01:32:50,803
Did you get through to him?

856
01:32:50,887 --> 01:32:53,389
-There's still no answer.
-I've called the police.

857
01:32:53,473 --> 01:32:55,516
Everything is OK.

858
01:33:10,948 --> 01:33:12,532
You bastard!

859
01:33:12,616 --> 01:33:15,785
I'll fucking kill you! I'll fucking kill you!

860
01:33:15,869 --> 01:33:17,870
You fucking bastard!

861
01:33:17,954 --> 01:33:21,623
I'll fucking kill you!
You fucking bastard!

862
01:33:21,708 --> 01:33:23,834
I'll fucking kill you!

863
01:33:23,918 --> 01:33:25,461
I'll fucking kill you.

864
01:33:35,054 --> 01:33:37,221
You're too late.

865
01:33:37,306 --> 01:33:40,058
-Why?
-It's the rules.

866
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:45,479
Argh!

867
01:34:24,098 --> 01:34:25,891
You're gonna be all right.

868
01:34:25,975 --> 01:34:28,602
You're just wounded... wounded in the shoulder.

869
01:34:29,729 --> 01:34:32,439
I have to go and get help.

870
01:34:32,657 --> 01:34:35,075
Don't leave me!

871
01:34:35,159 --> 01:34:36,451
No!

872
01:34:36,536 --> 01:34:38,578
No! No!

873
01:34:40,540 --> 01:34:42,582
No! Ow!

874
01:34:44,883 --> 01:34:48,582
Lawrence! Lawrence!

875
01:34:52,508 --> 01:34:53,925
D-Don't worry.

876
01:34:54,010 --> 01:34:55,510
I'll bring someone back.

877
01:34:55,595 --> 01:34:57,220
I promise.

878
01:35:17,683 --> 01:35:19,726
Key.

879
01:35:37,951 --> 01:35:39,994
Key. Key!

880
01:36:02,306 --> 01:36:05,225
Hello, Mr. Hindle.

881
01:36:05,309 --> 01:36:07,686
Or as they called you around the hospital...

882
01:36:08,771 --> 01:36:09,813
...Zep.

883
01:36:09,897 --> 01:36:11,940
I want you to make a choice.

884
01:36:16,444 --> 01:36:19,905
There's a slow-acting poison
coursing through your system

885
01:36:19,990 --> 01:36:22,908
which only I have the antidote for.

886
01:36:22,993 --> 01:36:25,494
Will you murder a mother and her child

887
01:36:25,579 --> 01:36:27,955
to save yourself?

888
01:36:28,038 --> 01:36:29,998
Dr. Gordon's time is up.

889
01:36:30,082 --> 01:36:31,332
Mrs. Gordon!

890
01:36:32,209 --> 01:36:35,503
Listen carefully, if you will. There are rules.

891
01:36:35,587 --> 01:36:38,006
-Why?
-It's the rules.

892
01:37:25,258 --> 01:37:29,136
The key to that chain is in the bathtub.

893
01:37:39,897 --> 01:37:42,899
He's a very interesting person.
His name is John.

894
01:37:42,983 --> 01:37:45,401
He has an inoperable frontal-lobe tumor.

895
01:37:45,485 --> 01:37:48,820
-Sick from disease eating away at me inside.
-Sounds like Jigsaw.

896
01:37:48,905 --> 01:37:51,782
I'm sick of people
not appreciating their blessings.

897
01:37:51,866 --> 01:37:55,410
He books himself front-row seats
to his own sicko games.

898
01:37:55,495 --> 01:37:59,372
Hello, Mark, Paul, Amanda,
Zep, Adam, Dr. Gordon.

899
01:37:59,456 --> 01:38:01,165
I want to play a game.

900
01:38:27,398 --> 01:38:30,943
Most people are so ungrateful to be alive.

901
01:38:31,945 --> 01:38:33,487
But not you.

902
01:38:34,614 --> 01:38:36,782
Not any more.

903
01:38:40,327 --> 01:38:43,120
Game over.

904
01:38:43,205 --> 01:38:46,123
Argh! Argh!

905
01:38:46,208 --> 01:38:49,043
Don't! Don't!

906
01:38:49,127 --> 01:38:52,880
Don't! Argh!
