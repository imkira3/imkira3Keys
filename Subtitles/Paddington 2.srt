00:55:04,441 --> 00:55:06,674
The microphone is on
the other side.

1115
00:55:06,676 --> 00:55:09,609
It's got "microphone"
written on it.

1116
00:55:13,007 --> 00:55:16,340
Gentlemen, if I have
offended you in any way...

1117
00:55:16,342 --> 00:55:17,473
KNUCKLES:
Don't worry about it.

1118
00:55:17,475 --> 00:55:18,907
We're fond of
the little fella.

1119
00:55:18,909 --> 00:55:20,074
And let's face it,

1120
00:55:20,076 --> 00:55:23,073
if anyone can recognize
a criminal gang, it's us.

(ALL AGREEING)

1122
00:55:24,175 --> 00:55:25,807
We'd be grateful for any help.

1123
00:55:25,809 --> 00:55:27,140
Please.

1124
00:55:27,142 --> 00:55:28,839
Well? Knuckles.

1125
00:55:28,841 --> 00:55:32,006
I'm afraid I don't recognize
any of them. Lads?

1126
00:55:32,008 --> 00:55:33,106
ALL: No.

1127
00:55:33,108 --> 00:55:34,773
I'm afraid
I couldn't possibly comment.

1128
00:55:34,775 --> 00:55:35,772
Oh.

1129
00:55:35,774 --> 00:55:37,205
KNUCKLES:
Sorry to say it, kid,

1130
00:55:37,207 --> 00:55:39,073
but your friends are barking
up the wrong tree.

1131
00:55:39,075 --> 00:55:42,106
A nun, a beefeater and a king?

1132
00:55:42,108 --> 00:55:46,072
Sounds more like a fancy dress
party than a criminal gang.

1133
00:55:46,074 --> 00:55:47,673
PADDINGTON: Then,

1134
00:55:47,675 --> 00:55:49,809
what are we going to
do now?

1135
00:55:58,474 --> 00:55:59,907
- (BICYCLE BELL RINGS)
- Oh!

1136
00:55:59,909 --> 00:56:01,907
- Watch where you're going.
- So sorry. Sorry.

1137
00:56:01,909 --> 00:56:04,709
Sorry, I get grumpy
when I haven't had breakfast.

1138
00:56:07,441 --> 00:56:09,375
Keys. Keys. Keys!

1139
00:56:10,808 --> 00:56:11,876
Bottoms!

1140
00:56:13,941 --> 00:56:15,540
You can't park here!

1141
00:56:15,542 --> 00:56:17,674
I'm not parked,
I'm doing the bins.

1142
00:56:17,676 --> 00:56:20,272
You're not doing the bins,
sunshine,

1143
00:56:20,274 --> 00:56:23,238
you're studying
on council time.

1144
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,073
I'm gonna report you.

1145
00:56:25,075 --> 00:56:26,639
And your hat.

1146
00:56:26,641 --> 00:56:29,406
- Morning, Miss Kitts, Colonel.
- Oh, morning, Mrs Brown.

1147
00:56:29,408 --> 00:56:31,138
Judy asked me
to drop these off to you.

1148
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:32,840
CURRY: Propaganda!

1149
00:56:32,842 --> 00:56:36,238
You are wasting your time
trying to peddle that rubbish.

1150
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:39,373
Everyone round here knows
it was your bear that done it.

1151
00:56:39,375 --> 00:56:43,073
And this street is a far,
far better place without him.

1152
00:56:43,075 --> 00:56:44,538
- What?
- (WOLFIE BARKING)

1153
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:46,674
Oh, it's that mangy dog!

1154
00:56:46,676 --> 00:56:49,039
You are going to the pound,
my son.

1155
00:56:49,041 --> 00:56:51,072
Barking without a license
in a built-up area.

1156
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:52,372
Give them here, Mary.

1157
00:56:52,374 --> 00:56:53,839
I have to sell them
under the counter,

1158
00:56:53,841 --> 00:56:56,238
for obvious reasons,
but people are buying them.

1159
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,338
Really?

1160
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:59,106
It's a bloomin' good read.

1161
00:56:59,108 --> 00:57:00,406
Made a few people round here

1162
00:57:00,408 --> 00:57:01,805
think twice
about your young bear.

1163
00:57:01,807 --> 00:57:03,972
You just need to find
that thief.

1164
00:57:03,974 --> 00:57:06,039
Oh, we're trying.

1165
00:57:06,041 --> 00:57:08,907
Don't suppose you know where
he is, do you, Feathers?

1166
00:57:08,909 --> 00:57:10,442
He's behind you.

1167
00:57:11,274 --> 00:57:12,572
Sorry, what?

1168
00:57:12,574 --> 00:57:14,173
PHOENIX: Coo-eee!

1169
00:57:14,175 --> 00:57:16,606
- Mary?
- Oh, hello, Phoenix.

1170
00:57:16,608 --> 00:57:17,940
Why don't you come on in?

1171
00:57:17,942 --> 00:57:21,738
I want to hear all about
the investigation. Yeah?

1172
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:24,572
Mysterious things have been
happening all over town.

1173
00:57:24,574 --> 00:57:26,739
- Oh, yes?
- Strange characters

1174
00:57:26,741 --> 00:57:28,974
turning up at every landmark
in that book.

1175
00:57:28,976 --> 00:57:30,305
Are they?

1176
00:57:30,307 --> 00:57:32,338
I don't know.

1177
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:34,007
Perhaps
it's just a coincidence.

1178
00:57:34,009 --> 00:57:36,939
Henry says I let my imagination
get the better of me.

1179
00:57:36,941 --> 00:57:39,238
Well, you're an artist, Mary,
like me.

1180
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:43,874
Our imaginations run free
like bison upon the plain.

1181
00:57:43,876 --> 00:57:46,440
But can I just say,
in this particular case,

1182
00:57:46,442 --> 00:57:49,172
I think dear old Henry might
have a point.

1183
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:50,472
Do you?

1184
00:57:50,474 --> 00:57:52,872
But I do have a little bit
of good news

1185
00:57:52,874 --> 00:57:55,306
that might turn your frown
upside down.

1186
00:57:55,308 --> 00:57:56,573
Oh, yes?

1187
00:57:56,575 --> 00:57:58,506
It looks, fingers,
fingers, fingers,

1188
00:57:58,508 --> 00:58:00,071
as though the funding
may be coming through

1189
00:58:00,073 --> 00:58:01,238
for my one-man show.

1190
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:02,806
Oh. Right.

1191
00:58:02,808 --> 00:58:04,505
It's an evening of monologue
and song,

1192
00:58:04,507 --> 00:58:06,338
featuring some of
my better known characters.

1193
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:07,973
Would you like
a little preview?

1194
00:58:07,975 --> 00:58:09,406
Um...

1195
00:58:09,408 --> 00:58:14,673
Picture this scene. Darkness,
then suddenly spotlight, me,

Oh, Mary, you look sad.
You don't like musicals?

1200
00:58:25,874 --> 00:58:26,940
No. No, no, no.

1201
00:58:26,942 --> 00:58:29,272
I suppose
it seems so unfair

1202
00:58:29,274 --> 00:58:31,540
Paddington is in prison
and yet

- life carries on.
- Oh, I know.

1204
00:58:34,541 --> 00:58:38,172
It must be so hard to accept
that he won,

The man in the poster.
Your wonderful drawing.

1209
00:58:47,508 --> 00:58:50,575
Yes, but... how do you know
he had blue eyes?

1210
00:58:51,107 --> 00:58:52,238
Hmm?

1211
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,374
It's just a pencil sketch.

1212
00:58:58,942 --> 00:59:00,672
Ooh.

1213

Well, then I must have
colored him in. (CHUCKLES)

He's a master of disguise.

- She's gone mad.
- MARY: Think about it, Henry.

1217
00:59:10,876 --> 00:59:13,440
Someone out there knows about
the Kozlova fortune, right?

1218
00:59:13,442 --> 00:59:15,039
Alleged fortune.

1219

looking for a criminal gang.

Knuckles?

1221
00:59:18,107 --> 00:59:19,971
- Because there was no gang.
- It was one man.

1222
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,340

Can we just return

I'm wrong, shall we?

Knuckles?

1249
01:00:37,474 --> 01:00:39,640
KNUCKLES: Got a proposition
for you, kid.

1250
01:00:39,642 --> 01:00:42,039
Me and the boys have
been talking, and

1251
01:00:42,041 --> 01:00:43,339
seems to us,

1252
01:00:43,341 --> 01:00:45,373
if you're gonna clear
your name,

1253
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:46,738
you're gonna need our help.

1254

The Browns may mean well,
but...

1255
01:00:48,642 --> 01:00:51,706
It takes a thief
to catch a thief.

1256
01:00:51,708 --> 01:00:53,005
Oh.

1257
01:00:53,007 --> 01:00:55,372
KNUCKLES: Now, if we could
figure a way out of here

1258
01:00:55,374 --> 01:00:56,739
and hit the streets,

1259
01:00:56,741 --> 01:00:58,672
we'd find this guy
soon enough.

1260
01:00:58,674 --> 01:01:01,672
But that would mean... escape.

1261
01:01:01,674 --> 01:01:04,372
KNUCKLES: It certainly would.
And we got a plan.

1262
01:01:04,374 --> 01:01:07,338
But it's a four-man job,
so we need your help.

1263
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:08,938
What do you say, kid?

1264
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:10,806
It's very kind of you,
Knuckles,

1265
01:01:10,808 --> 01:01:12,605
but I don't think
Aunt Lucy would like

1266
01:01:12,607 --> 01:01:15,506
the idea of us breaking out
of prison.

1267
01:01:15,508 --> 01:01:17,772
The Browns will find
the real thief.

1268
01:01:17,774 --> 01:01:19,938
I just need to be patient.

1269

1284
01:02:04,709 --> 01:02:06,774
Yes. We thought the agent

01:02:06,776 --> 01:02:08,073
would be really interesting.

But I've got two minutes,

Mr. Buchanan back on stage?

(CHUCKLES) No, no, no,

1303

He's a terrific actor,

1304
01:02:57,807 --> 01:03:00,206
but there is a teensy
little problem.

Really?

1306

He won't work
with other people.

1307
01:03:03,442 --> 01:03:06,473
Thinks they dilute his talent.
