1
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:46,797
Once upon a time,
in an obscure corner of the earth,

2
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:49,967
there was a teeny-tiny encounter.

3
00:00:53,596 --> 00:00:58,267
And so began the long, long
adventure and days spent in combat

4
00:00:58,476 --> 00:01:03,773
involving Son Goku and his friends,
and revolving around the Dragon Balls.

5
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:09,779
Battles against foes who
were mesmerized by Shen Long,

6
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,406
who would grant any wish...

7
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:14,116
Hit the mark!

8
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:19,747
A furious fight against Piccolo,
which ended in vengeance...

9
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,961
You lose!

10
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:37,556
The matchup against Vegeta,
with the survival of humanity at stake...

11
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:48,484
You dumb-ass!

12
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,446
The battle with Freeza on Planet Namek...

13
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:57,076
The Artificial Humans and the Cell Games...

14
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:01,622
See you in hell!

15
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:03,415
Now!

16
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:08,087
The final showdown with Majin Boo...

17
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:12,299
As one after another powerful enemies appear,

18
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:17,179
the Super Saiyan Goku,
together with his growing sons,

19
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:22,768
Gohan and Goten, and his other friends,
save the earth from its tight spots,

20
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:28,315
and before anyone knows it,
peace returns to earth.

21
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:31,569
However...

22
00:02:57,636 --> 00:03:01,473
Have you sensed it, too, Kaioshin?

23
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:06,478
Yes. He certainly is
awake early this time, isn't he?

24
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:13,194
My word, peace truly is short-lived.

25
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:16,947
And after they just created the world anew, too.

26
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:20,618
I would think that Kaio
and the others sense it, too,

27
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:24,538
but tell him to be on the lookout, just in case.

28
00:03:24,747 --> 00:03:28,083
Mm-hmm. All right.

29
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:35,758
Yes, Kaioshin-sama.

30
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,638
Yes, yes...

31
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:45,017
Yes, I have noticed it, too.

32
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:49,730
Hey! Be quiet, Goku! I'm trying to talk here!

33
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:54,568
Goku? Do you mean, Son Goku-san is there?

34
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:55,778
Y-Yes.

35
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:58,447
He is here on my world to train.

36
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:00,616
We cannot allow him to become aware of this.

37
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,785
He is sure to take an interest.

38
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:06,747
Yes, of course, where Beers-sama is concerned...

39
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:08,832
G-Goodbye, then...

40
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,088
What about Beers-sama?

41
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,132
G-Goku!

42
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:20,261
Huh? Is that the name of some candy?

43
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:26,976
Y-You found me out, huh?
It is a most delicious candy.

44
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,852
Well of course it ain't!

45
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:32,356
Kaio-sama, you were talking
like you were pretty freaked out.

46
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:40,322
It's something you don't need to know about.

47
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:43,659
Oh, if you tell me that,
I'm just gonna ask you even more!

48
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,619
There's no way I'm telling.

49
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:47,830
You were speaking to Kaioshin-sama, right?

50
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,040
Maybe I'll go ask him directly.

51
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:55,045
All right! All right! Don't go
using your Instantaneous Movement!

52
00:04:57,089 --> 00:05:00,342
Don't tell Kaioshin-sama
that you heard this from me.

53
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:06,015
There are deities in this
world that create planets and life,

54
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,517
such as Kaioshin-sama.

55
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:10,269
And, conversely,

56
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:14,898
there are also deities
who destroy planets and life.

57
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:20,821
So then,

58
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,906
this Beers-sama is one of them?

59
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:29,455
That is correct. Beers the Destroyer.

60
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:33,625
Huh? He's a deity, but he's still a destroyer?

61
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:38,005
Birth and destruction.

62
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:47,514
They're needed in order to
maintain balance in the world.

63
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:51,727
I wonder how many worlds
will fall victim this time.

64
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,437
My goodness...

65
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:57,983
...Beers the Destroyer is awakening, is he?

66
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:01,320
We won't know peace for some time, huh?

67
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:04,990
Why have you changed into your gi?

68
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,035
This Beers-sama guy is pretty strong, right?

69
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:09,661
Don't tell me you're...

70
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,373
I can't wait to see how strong he is!

71
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:14,333
Y-You idiot!

72
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,376
What?!

73
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:19,546
You just don't get it! Beers-sama's strength

74
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:22,174
is on a completely different level than you are!

75
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:25,677
He's Beers-sama, the
greatest destroyer in the world!

76
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,846
He's such a capricious
destroyer that even Kaioshin-sama

77
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:29,473
would be scared to come face-to-face with him,

78
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:34,019
and maybe pee his pants
a little bit, he's so terrifying!

79
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:38,107
The part where he's the strongest
in the world has me fascinated!

80
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,993
Please wake up, Beers-sama.

81
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:16,830
You must not fall back asleep again.

82
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:22,002
You are the one who set your
alarm bomb yourself, aren't you?

83
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:25,088
If you don't get up soon,
your backup alarms will--

84
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,514
All right... all right.

85
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:40,229
I won't have you sleeping in
for 15 years, like you did last time.

86
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,856
If you insist on not getting up...

87
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:48,403
...would you like me to perform
my waking-up song for you again?

88
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:51,406
Well then...

89
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:53,116
A-All right!

90
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:55,244
All right.

91
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:34,616
I only slept 39 years this time.
That's no more than a catnap.

92
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:38,745
Beers-sama, you are the
one who set your wake-up time.

93
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:41,665
Incidentally, why did you choose this time?

94
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:44,543
There's something that I was curious about.

95
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:49,381
Well, I have prepared your bath.
Please go take it.

96
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,884
No way. I hate baths.

97
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:59,182
You are covered in bomb soot.
It could contain mold.

98
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:00,350
Come on!

99
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,144
What if I say no?

100
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:06,231
Someone will say "Beers the Destroyer
is amazing, but pee-yew!"

101
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,318
and word will spread around.

102
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:15,324
Whis, I'm tired of your unfunny jokes.

103
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,786
I'll destroy you.

104
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:26,668
By the way, Whis, while I was asleep,

105
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:31,256
did Freeza leave Planet Vegeta destroyed for me?

106
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:35,010
Yes, without a trace.

107
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:38,388
Oh, yeah? I could have given
the folks on that planet an eternity,

108
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:40,724
but they'd still be nothing but trouble.

109
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:43,560
And that King Vegeta was especially hard-fisted.

110
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,606
I would have been happy to destroy them, too,

111
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:52,319
but their world is so far away,
you know? It was too much trouble.

112
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:56,490
I have to admit, though,
Freeza is a bad apple, too.

113
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:58,825
He's so self-important. The next time I see him,

114
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:01,745
I think I might destroy him, too.

115
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:06,708
There won't be any need for that.
Freeza has been defeated.

116
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:08,168
Eh?

117
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:11,588
You mean there's someone that can defeat Freeza?

118
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:13,465
One moment, please.

119
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:27,270
Huh? It seems like I've
seen this somewhere before.

120
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:29,189
Who is this guy?

121
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:31,024
A Saiyan.

122
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:35,404
He appears to be called
both Son Goku and Kakarrot.

123
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:43,412
I thought all the Saiyans died in
the destruction of Planet Vegeta.

124
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,414
Most of them did perish,

125
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:49,626
but some who happened to
be on other worlds were spared.

126
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:53,296
And by the way, Prince Vegeta was one of them.

127
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:56,883
Isn't Saiyan hair supposed to be black?

128
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:03,932
I have to say, I'm surprised
a Saiyan could defeat Freeza.

129
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:15,861
At this point, the Saiyans
have acquired a technique

130
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:19,281
whereby they become
what they call "Super Saiyans."

131
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,199
What's that?

132
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:25,746
Super Saiyan? Super Saiyan?

133
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:27,956
Super Saiyan?!

134
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:30,417
That's it.

135
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,169
That's what it was!

136
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:33,378
What what was?

137
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:38,967
Let's see... Super Saiyan... Super Saiyan...

138
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:40,802
n-God!

139
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:42,804
I dreamed about it!

140
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:47,851
A dream where I fought against
a Super Saiyan God, like this guy!

141
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:48,810
Uh-huh.

142
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:54,524
You still don't get it?
It was a premonition. Premonition!

143
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:56,902
You mean, your dream?

144
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,783
Beers-sama, your premonitions

145
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:05,744
don't have all that high
an accuracy rate, do they?

146
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:10,457
That dream you had earlier
about that idol moving here

147
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:12,793
didn't come true, did it?

148
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,669
You're making fun of me, huh?

149
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:17,672
All right, come with me, Whis.

150
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:25,514
Seer! Seer, are you here?

151
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:38,568
I was taking a walk. What is it?

152
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:41,822
You told me 39 years ago, didn't you,

153
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:46,076
that in 39 years, an arch-rival would appear?

154
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:49,704
Did I say that?

155
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:51,540
You said so, didn't you?

156
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:54,751
Okay, <i>I</i> did.

157
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,836
See?

158
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:58,755
The Seer's prophecy and my premonition--

159
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:02,175
An arch-rival of mine is going to appear.

160
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:04,719
A Super Saiyan God!

161
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:08,598
It sounds entirely questionable to me.

162
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:12,602
It's hard to imagine an arch-rival
for you to begin with, Beers-sama.

163
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:17,691
Well, even if the arch-rival that the
Seer mentioned is an exaggeration,

164
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:20,402
someone fascinating is bound to appear, right?

165
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,572
That's why I woke up early this time.

166
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:27,075
I see. So that's why.

167
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:30,912
So, are you going to go see the Saiyans?

168
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:32,539
Of course I am.

169
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:36,459
I have to find this "Super Saiyan God."

170
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:42,424
Super Saiyan God, you say?
Such over-the-top naming.

171
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,801
It ends up sounding tawdry.

172
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:53,852
I found them. Most of the surviving Saiyans,

173
00:14:54,060 --> 00:15:01,860
five of them, are in 4032 Green, on
Planet 877, living on a world called "earth."

174
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:06,698
Earth? I'm sure I've been
to that planet once, long ago.

175
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:10,410
That's the planet which
had something called dinosaurs,

176
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:13,246
which took a rude attitude toward me,
so I exterminated them, right?

177
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:17,918
However, one of them,
the Saiyan that defeated Freeza,

178
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:21,838
currently appears to be
on Kaio of the North's world.

179
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:26,968
A Saiyan at a Kaio's place?
That sounds suspicious.

180
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,513
Whis, how long will it take to get there?

181
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:32,515
Roughly 26 minutes.

182
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:35,560
About the length of an episode of TV anime, huh?

183
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,562
Sure is far!

184
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:40,857
Well, what choice is there?
I'll suck it up and go.

185
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:43,485
All right, then, let's be off!

186
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:46,446
To the Kaio of the North's world!

187
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:50,742
Yeah!

188
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,943
Bulma-san, happy---

189
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,570
...birthday!

190
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:38,248
Eh?! He's not coming?!

191
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:42,419
Why is he training at
Kaio-sama's place at a time like this?

192
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,421
That's the kind of guy he is.

193
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:48,508
Geez, I told him about this over six months ago!

194
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:51,886
Huh? Where's Vegeta-san?

195
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:54,139
Looks like he's training.

196
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,475
Honest to goodness, you Saiyans...

197
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,194
He)', you there!

198
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:09,738
Eh?

199
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:12,282
Don't just sit around, bring me another drink.

200
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,035
I'll give you an autograph afterward.

201
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:17,996
All right, what kind of drink would you like?

202
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:24,586
Mister Satan, this gentleman
is Bulma-san's father, Dr. Briefs.

203
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:32,052
Th-The greatest genius in the world?

204
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,596
Not to mention the richest man in the world.

205
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:38,641
Oh, sweetheart, you're
the richest man in the world?

206
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,643
Huh, I'm not too sure of that, myself.

207
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:43,063
H-How terribly rude of me!

208
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:46,107
By the way, what kind of drink would you like?

209
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:51,863
D-Don't be absurd!
I will bring you something to drink!

210
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:53,907
What can I get for you?

211
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:56,534
Huh? I'm fine right now.

212
00:17:56,743 --> 00:18:00,872
Oh, not at all! What would you like to drink?

213
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:02,582
Okay, a cola.

214
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:10,048
A cola! Right, as you wish!
I will bring you a whole case, right now!

215
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:15,136
Ah, geez, Papa. How embarrassing.

216
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:20,683
I put it on to look dashin' comin'
to Bulma-san's birthday party.

217
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:26,606
By the way, Bulma-san, just how
old have you turned this birthday?

218
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:30,068
How rude! As though I'd tell you!

219
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,362
It's true that the prizes
for the bingo tournament

220
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:35,031
include a castle and an airplane, right?

221
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,409
That's right. If that's too much
trouble, I can convert it to cash.

222
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:41,162
That's the richest person in the world for you!

223
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:45,041
I wonder if Goku-sa will drop in
for at least the bingo tournament.

224
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,336
Bulma, are there any
X-rated DVDs among the prizes?

225
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:50,046
No!

226
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,176
O-Oh, no!

227
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:57,137
Wh-What is it, Goku?!

228
00:18:57,345 --> 00:19:00,306
Today is Bulma's birthday party!

229
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:03,518
This ain't good! She'll be mad at me!

230
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:06,646
Oh. Don't startle me over something like that!

231
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:09,315
She's scary. Probably...

232
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:13,278
It would be a close contest
between her and this Destroyer guy.

233
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:27,125
<i>Kaio-sama?</i>

234
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:29,752
Goku!

235
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:32,589
Th-This is serious! Here! Right here!

236
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:34,257
Huh?! Bulma is coming here?!

237
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:35,925
No!

238
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:37,552
<i>Beers-sama is!</i>

239
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,638
Beers the Destroyer is on his way here!

240
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:42,807
Huh? Eh?

241
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:45,435
I ain't sensing anything.

242
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:48,438
You can't sense the presence of deities!

243
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:52,984
Remember, whatever you do,
refrain from doing anything stupid.

244
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:56,362
It will be fine, I tell you.

245
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:57,864
All right!

246
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:01,451
You worry me.

247
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:03,536
Goku, go hide inside the house!

248
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:05,121
Huh? What for?

249
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,789
Quickly!

250
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:09,209
And quickly, too. Geez...

251
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:10,293
Hurry!

252
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:11,836
Okay, O kaY!

253
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:18,551
Why, though? Why is Beers-sama coming here?

254
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,929
Why, indeed?

255
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:32,398
<i>Wh-Why, Beers-sama...</i>

256
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,110
Him, huh?

257
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:39,280
He sure looks like he
ain't just anyone, all right?

258
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:40,907
...w-welcome to my...

259
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:46,329
...humble place. Thank you
for coming... all this way...

260
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:50,458
Long time no see, huh?

261
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:52,502
Kaio of the North...

262
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:56,631
Huh? Oh! That guy's the
one they call Beers-sama?

263
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:00,176
I must say... your world...

264
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:01,427
...is small, huh?

265
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:05,014
Eh? Y-Yes... I'm terribly sorry.

266
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:08,434
Please excuse the cramped fit.

267
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:12,647
Long ago, Beers-sama
destroyed it, making it smaller--

268
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:14,732
taking it out after losing at hide-and-seek.

269
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:16,943
Oh, did I?

270
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:20,613
However, considering that
you restored your world earlier,

271
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:24,909
and you did not bring
it back to its original size,

272
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:28,288
you must prefer it to be this size, don't you?

273
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:30,581
Anyhow...

274
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,459
Beers-sama, what brings you here?

275
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:38,131
Ah, I have a little business
with the Saiyan inside.

276
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:39,966
Yikes!

277
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:41,259
Come on out here!

278
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:44,512
H-How terribly impolite of me!

279
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:48,308
Goku! Come say hello to Beers-sama!

280
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,646
Heya! I'm Go--

281
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:59,569
I was certain you were going to say that!

282
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:03,573
You're old enough to know better!
At least offer a proper greeting!

283
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:10,079
Uh, wh-why, hello there. I'm... I mean...

284
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:14,375
My name is Son Goku.
It's honorable to meet you, Sir.

285
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:20,048
Good morning. Now then,
I have something I want to ask you.

286
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:23,384
Let's see... Super...

287
00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:25,887
Super Saiyan God.

288
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:26,929
Yes, yes.

289
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:31,559
Do you know of the existence
of this "Super Saiyan God"?

290
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:33,728
Super Saiyan God?

291
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:36,689
I know of just plain "Super Saiyans,"

292
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:39,901
but I ain't ever heard of that "God" business.

293
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,613
I haven't heard of it, Sir.

294
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:49,202
This is the first time I have heard
the term "Super Saiyan God," myself.

295
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,162
Ah, I see.

296
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:57,919
I heard from Whis, here, that
you're the one who defeated Freeza?

297
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:03,633
Freeza? Yeah, I defeated him, all right. Sir.

298
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:14,018
It doesn't appear to me like
you could defeat him as you are,

299
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:16,562
but I understand you transform and power up--

300
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:19,107
into what's called a Super Saiyan.

301
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:22,777
That is correct. You are well informed.

302
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:27,198
But you don't know about the God thing.

303
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:30,743
Whis...

304
00:23:30,952 --> 00:23:35,289
...is Prince Vegeta, on the planet
called earth, also a Super Saiyan?

305
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:39,460
Yes. And each of the three others
also seem to be able to transform.

306
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:42,547
You know that much, as well?

307
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:48,094
All of them, huh?
That seems suspicious. Well then...

308
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:51,013
I wonder if I can find
anything by going to earth.

309
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:56,352
B-Beers-sama, I do not think
the other Saiyans know, either.

310
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:59,647
I won't know unless I ask them, will I?

311
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:02,775
Whis, how long to reach earth?

312
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:04,652
Roughly three minutes.

313
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:10,116
Three minutes? All right, then.
Well, I think I'm going to go see this "earth."

314
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:11,784
Um...

315
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:15,705
You're not going to destroy it,
or anything, right?

316
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:18,124
As long as nothing happens to annoy me.

317
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:19,333
Hey, listen!

318
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:24,714
Ain't you--I mean, Beers-sama,
I heard you were ridiculously strong.

319
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:28,217
Would you mind showing
me just a little of it? Sir?

320
00:24:28,426 --> 00:24:32,221
You want to see my power? How?

321
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:35,475
I'd like to have a sparring
match with you, if only for a minute!

322
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:37,643
Goku! That's enough!

323
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:39,812
I have lived a long time,

324
00:24:40,021 --> 00:24:43,900
but I've never heard a
request as unique as that one.

325
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:46,194
You certainly seem sure of yourself.

326
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:47,653
Or could it be that you're simply

327
00:24:47,862 --> 00:24:49,489
just a big dummy, instead?

328
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:51,157
Yes, he's a big dummy!

329
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:53,659
He is just a big dummy, you see!

330
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:55,411
Sure.

331
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,080
Okay, come at me with your full power.

332
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:01,959
Thank you! I mean, thank you very much!

333
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:05,838
But are you sure you want my
full power right from the start?

334
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:10,176
If you get hurt, don't go getting
upset and destroying this planet.

335
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:11,844
You have my promise.

336
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:13,638
Well, go ahead.

337
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,854
<i>Okay -</i>

338
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:28,236
First, this is "Super Saiyan."

339
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:35,660
And this is "Super Saiyan 2."

340
00:25:46,671 --> 00:25:51,008
And this is the mighty "Super Saiyan 3"!

341
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:53,761
Run for it, Bubbles!

342
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:58,432
Well, well, this is a surprise.

343
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:01,978
It appears that this isn't
just a bunch of hot air, after all.

344
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:03,604
Heh-heh, you see?

345
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:05,898
If you want, I can go back to "2" for you.

346
00:26:06,107 --> 00:26:09,110
No, no, as you are will be fine.

347
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:11,237
Okay, begin.

348
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:13,739
You're looking down on me. All right...!

349
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,659
Well then, let's be off.

350
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:41,327
<i>Okay -</i>

351
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:43,913
See you later, Kaio of the North.

352
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:07,770
Are you still alive, you big dummy?

353
00:28:18,072 --> 00:28:20,032
Oh, right! I can't just sit around.

354
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:23,244
I have to contact Vegeta as soon as possible!

355
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:40,052
Vegeta! It's Kaio!

356
00:28:51,147 --> 00:28:53,149
What do you want with me, Kaio?

357
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:55,401
Listen closely to what I'm about to say.

358
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:59,071
Beers the Destroyer will be there very soon.

359
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,906
The Destroyer?

360
00:29:01,115 --> 00:29:03,784
I've heard that name before.

361
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:07,246
In any case, once Beers-sama arrives there,

362
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:10,916
do absolutely, absolutely nothing to engage him!

363
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:15,880
Otherwise, it will mean the
annihilation of the earth itself.

364
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,757
The earth will be annihilated?

365
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:21,260
Goku couldn't leave well
enough alone, and was easily beaten.

366
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:23,679
He was what?! Kakarrot?!

367
00:29:23,888 --> 00:29:28,809
Super Saiyan 3 Goku was left
barely breathing after just two blows.

368
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:31,604
Just two blows, you say?

369
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,151
I'm begging you.
The fate of the earth rests with you.

370
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:50,956
That really was awesome.
Imagine, there being someone like that...

371
00:29:51,165 --> 00:29:57,630
I warned you, over and over!
Just be grateful you weren't killed!

372
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,259
To get any stronger,

373
00:30:02,468 --> 00:30:07,139
there ain't no choice but to
merge with Vegeta, is there? No...

374
00:30:07,348 --> 00:30:10,100
...even at that, I doubt I could beat him.

375
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:15,272
Let's hope the people on
earth don't do anything foolish.

376
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:20,277
He said something about
"Super Saiyan God," didn't he?

377
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:24,448
Is that something I can arrive at with training?

378
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:30,287
Or is it the name of a Saiyan
called "God"? ls there another...?

379
00:30:44,635 --> 00:30:45,970
A senzu bean?

380
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:57,147
I'm better!

381
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,696
Kaio-sama, we have to
let everyone on earth know!

382
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:05,990
I've already told Vegeta.

383
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:10,327
He's the one most likely
to step over the line, after all.

384
00:31:11,704 --> 00:31:15,875
Things ain't looking good.
I'd better get back to earth right away.

385
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:20,045
Or maybe I should train a bit first.

386
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:26,635
You're finally here, huh, Vegeta?

387
00:31:26,844 --> 00:31:29,346
Oh, and why are you wearing your combat gear

388
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:31,807
to your own wife's birthday party?

389
00:31:32,016 --> 00:31:34,727
What's wrong? You seem unusually blue.

390
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:39,815
A-ha, could it be that you're in shock over
your beloved wife turning another year older?

391
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:41,984
It sure is nice for you Saiyans,

392
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:44,069
not having to grow older.

393
00:31:45,905 --> 00:31:47,323
Silence!

394
00:31:50,451 --> 00:31:52,453
What do you mean, "silence"?! Hmph!

395
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:55,122
What is this? I've got a knot in my stomach.

396
00:31:55,331 --> 00:31:58,918
Is the great Vegeta-sama trembling with fear?

397
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:01,170
What is with you?

398
00:32:02,296 --> 00:32:03,881
Beers the Destroyer...

399
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:06,508
Without a doubt, I know
I've met him somewhere before...

400
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:09,136
Hey, Prince Vegeta, right?

401
00:32:09,345 --> 00:32:11,472
You're all grown up now, aren't you?

402
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:17,519
It looks like this "Ki" that you
all use doesn't work on deities.

403
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:20,940
Ah, yes, well...

404
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:31,116
Something's come over Vegeta.

405
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,542
Do you remember me now?

406
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:43,504
I remember!

407
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:49,176
When we previously met,
you were still just a little boy, huh?

408
00:32:49,385 --> 00:32:53,931
Don't you remember? Your father, King Vegeta,

409
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:57,184
put on quite a spread for me.

410
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:26,005
The Destroyer, Beers...

411
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:27,965
...-sama...

412
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,884
What Kaio said was no exaggeration.

413
00:33:31,093 --> 00:33:33,762
This guy is trouble. He's way beyond trouble!

414
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:37,891
It looks to me like you're up
to something enjoyable here.

415
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,561
What's more, I smell something very good.

416
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:45,065
A-Ah, this? My wife is having a birthday party.

417
00:33:45,274 --> 00:33:49,278
Your wife? Well, I'll have
to go pay my respects.

418
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:50,320
<i>Beers-sama...</i>

419
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:53,449
Oh, right. The point of my visit...

420
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:59,705
Have you ever heard the term "Super Saiyan God"?

421
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:01,957
Super Saiyan God?

422
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:03,667
You don't know it, then?

423
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:06,587
Are you sure your premonition wasn't wrong?

424
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:08,714
I'm never wrong!

425
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:11,925
But you are, quite often.

426
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:14,887
I'm starting to get annoyed.

427
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:18,098
Oh, Vegeta, the man who
tells his wife to be silent...

428
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:18,974
Who have we here?

429
00:34:19,183 --> 00:34:21,101
O-Oh, th-this is...

430
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,436
...Beers-san and...

431
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:24,104
The name is Whis.

432
00:34:24,313 --> 00:34:29,943
Oh, friends of yours?
Hello. I'm Bulma, Vegeta's...

433
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:31,445
...beautiful wife.

434
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:33,614
--Hello, Bulma-san.
--Hello, Bulma-san.

435
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:37,659
Oh, my! For being friends of yours,
they have fine manners.

436
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:40,621
But you don't appear to be from earth.

437
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:42,873
You're aliens, right? Aliens?

438
00:34:43,082 --> 00:34:44,291
Th-That's enough!

439
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:48,587
We just happened to drop by earth,
and spotted Vegeta-kun here.

440
00:34:48,796 --> 00:34:52,716
Sightseeing? If you'd like,
why not come party with us, first?

441
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:53,884
You're quite welcome.

442
00:34:54,093 --> 00:34:54,968
H-Hey!

443
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:57,888
Well, I do hate to intrude...

444
00:34:58,097 --> 00:35:02,935
...but the truth is, I spotted some of the most
delicious-looking food when I first got here.

445
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:06,647
Go ahead, go ahead.

446
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:08,690
C-Come, let's go down there.

447
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:39,012
Hey! You there, the cat monster!
How'd you like a match with me?

448
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:39,930
A match?

449
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:41,390
Th-That idiot!

450
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:44,268
I'm pretty good!

451
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:47,646
Oh, Dad, you're embarrassing us!

452
00:35:47,855 --> 00:35:50,399
I apologize for his rudeness.

453
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:12,754
Where are the Dragon Balls?!

454
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:25,475
You idiots! If you make any
loud noises, they'll hear us!

455
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:27,352
R-Right!

456
00:36:32,733 --> 00:36:34,067
All right...

457
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:45,704
This house is ridiculously huge,
for crying out loud!

458
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:49,458
Pesky fools!

459
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:50,542
We' re sorry.

460
00:36:50,751 --> 00:36:51,960
Sheesh!

461
00:36:52,336 --> 00:36:55,505
Just where are the Dragon Balls, anyway?

462
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:58,800
All seven of them are
supposed to be together here.

463
00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:01,053
I don't know why I can't get my wish granted,

464
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:03,847
but right now, we're in luck!

465
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:07,976
My next goal is to be hugely wealthy!

466
00:37:08,185 --> 00:37:08,685
Huh?

467
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:11,396
L-it's not world domination?

468
00:37:11,605 --> 00:37:14,650
Getting a great deal of money comes first.

469
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:17,402
I've had enough of living the poor life.

470
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:19,154
We couldn't even get hired for part-time work

471
00:37:19,363 --> 00:37:22,199
in these child-like bodies we have, you know!

472
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:24,618
--Y-Yes...
--Well...

473
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:29,581
I am Great King Pilaf!

474
00:37:31,959 --> 00:37:35,879
Earlier, when we were
finally about to get Shen Long

475
00:37:36,088 --> 00:37:39,758
to grant our wish, Pilaf-sama,
you said "Make us young again!"

476
00:37:39,967 --> 00:37:41,218
Y-Yeah, but...

477
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,887
...there's no point in dominating
the world when we're old,

478
00:37:44,096 --> 00:37:45,597
if we're going to drop dead right away.

479
00:37:45,806 --> 00:37:48,141
Maybe so, but we're <i>too</i> young like this!

480
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,434
It was a relief for me.

481
00:37:49,643 --> 00:37:52,688
My life has been greatly extended, in dog years.

482
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:58,318
Stop your griping and hurry up
and find the Dragon Balls!

483
00:37:58,527 --> 00:38:01,196
And if worse comes to worst,
let's just grab anything of value!

484
00:38:01,405 --> 00:38:02,531
--Yes, Sir!
--Yes, Sir!

485
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:03,949
Okay!

486
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:11,540
"Prizes"

487
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,416
O-Over here...

488
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:14,668
What is it?

489
00:38:14,668 --> 00:38:19,047
"Bingo Tournament Prizes-Keep Out!"

490
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:29,224
You don't suppose...

491
00:38:29,433 --> 00:38:30,309
...all of these...

492
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:32,227
...are prizes?!

493
00:38:32,436 --> 00:38:34,438
That castle is a prize!

494
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:38,692
--Wow!
--Damn it, what a ritzy bunch!

495
00:38:41,695 --> 00:38:44,281
I'll spray graffiti on them!

496
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:44,948
"Stupid"

497
00:38:45,324 --> 00:38:48,702
Take that! And that! And that!

498
00:38:48,702 --> 00:38:49,453
I.

499
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:51,580
That's quite sordid.

500
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:55,000
--Come on!
--Let's hurry!

501
00:38:55,208 --> 00:39:00,088
Yeah! The Dragon Balls must be
hidden here someplace! Find them!

502
00:39:00,297 --> 00:39:01,673
--Yes, sir!
--Yes, sir!

503
00:39:17,898 --> 00:39:20,484
You don't think they're
inside the castle, do you?

504
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,277
<i>Pilaf-sama!</i>

505
00:39:22,486 --> 00:39:23,195
Did you find them?!

506
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:27,783
The participation prize is a
ten-year assortment of fine hams!

507
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:31,536
Get two or three boxes!

508
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:32,704
Yahoo!

509
00:39:32,913 --> 00:39:35,374
The second-place prize is...

510
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:41,755
What a ridiculously huge diamond!
Be sure to take it!

511
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:43,965
But if this is the second-place prize...

512
00:39:44,174 --> 00:39:46,051
First-place must be...

513
00:39:50,097 --> 00:39:51,890
We sure found them easily enough.

514
00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:52,933
<i>Pilaf-sama!</i>

515
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:56,478
Th-There really are all seven of them here!

516
00:39:56,686 --> 00:40:00,565
--Yahoo! Yahoo!
--Banzai! Banzai!

517
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:07,906
Pilaf-sama, let's get our
wish granted right now!

518
00:40:08,115 --> 00:40:09,157
You fool!

519
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:13,120
If we summon Shen Long in here,
the ceiling will collapse on us!

520
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:15,497
Hey, you guys!

521
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:20,627
What are you doing in there?

522
00:40:21,211 --> 00:40:24,589
W-We're friends of the boy who lives here.

523
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:27,342
Huh? My friends?

524
00:40:27,551 --> 00:40:29,219
Y-You're the boy who lives here?!

525
00:40:29,428 --> 00:40:30,679
That monkey is talking!

526
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:32,556
--Mon--
--Mon--

527
00:40:33,557 --> 00:40:37,769
Who are you calling a monkey?!
I am Great King Pilaf!

528
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:41,106
We came here to burgle the place!

529
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:43,859
What's the big idea, giving them your real name?

530
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:48,947
Hey, Goten! Come over here and
see this! There's a funny monkey!

531
00:40:49,156 --> 00:40:49,823
I'm not a monkey!

532
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:50,657
Hmm?

533
00:40:50,866 --> 00:40:54,786
Hey, boy! Be quiet! Do you want to get hurt?!

534
00:40:54,995 --> 00:40:56,121
What?

535
00:40:56,329 --> 00:40:57,456
Look.

536
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:01,751
Th-That distinctive hairstyle...

537
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,588
It looks extremely familiar...

538
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:08,633
Those blank eyes that reveal such innocence!

539
00:41:08,842 --> 00:41:11,553
They look extremely familiar...

540
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:13,346
H-He's that...

541
00:41:13,555 --> 00:41:15,807
"Genuine great ape!

542
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:20,770
Clear out!

543
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:22,230
Right!

544
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:39,581
You can have this.

545
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:49,174
<i>Pilaf-sama! Wait for me!</i>

546
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:54,513
Wow, that really was one
strange monkey and dog, huh?

547
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:55,764
Mm-hmm.

548
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:59,851
Hey, who was that girl who gave
you the pretty rock as a present?

549
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,686
Is she your friend, Trunks-kun?

550
00:42:01,895 --> 00:42:05,273
She's... my girlfriend.

551
00:42:05,774 --> 00:42:07,484
What do you think? Amazing, huh?

552
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:09,778
You mean, you're going out with her?

553
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:13,573
W-Well, yeah. We've even held hands.

554
00:42:13,782 --> 00:42:15,200
That's amazing!

555
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:17,118
Y-Yeah, I guess.

556
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:19,204
Amazing.

557
00:42:27,379 --> 00:42:29,631
Damn! What is he doing here?!

558
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,758
He's still a child, too!

559
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:36,429
And thanks to him, we didn't
get the Dragon Balls, did we?!

560
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:40,433
What?! You're creeping me out!

561
00:42:40,642 --> 00:42:44,521
Prepare to feast your eyes... on this!

562
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:48,608
I used the diamond to distract their gaze.

563
00:42:48,817 --> 00:42:53,446
They haven't realized that the
Si Xing Qiu ball has been stolen.

564
00:42:55,365 --> 00:42:56,575
You've outdone yourself, Mai!

565
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:57,534
Yes!

566
00:42:57,742 --> 00:43:01,079
Just a minute! We can't grant
our wish with just one of them.

567
00:43:01,288 --> 00:43:03,748
Don't you worry about that, Pilaf-sama.

568
00:43:03,957 --> 00:43:08,545
We'll say, "if you want this back,
hand over one million zeni,"

569
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:10,964
and demand their money!

570
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:12,882
Oh, I get it!

571
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:16,052
Mai, you're a genius! You big-time rascal!

572
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:19,848
Oh, no, not as much as you are, Pilaf-sama.

573
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:25,020
But that diamond was worth
more than ten billion zeni, wasn't it?

574
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:38,491
U-Um...

575
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:42,245
Y-You idiot! That huge
amount of money just means

576
00:43:42,454 --> 00:43:43,163
that much more stress, doesn't it?

577
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:46,166
Y-Yeah! If we get so
nervous that we pee our pants,

578
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:48,335
are you offering to wash them for us?!

579
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:49,169
Huh?

580
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:49,919
Eh?

581
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:50,712
Ahem...

582
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,006
I'm not so sure about that example.

583
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:56,009
It seemed to be a little bit off-color.

584
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:58,553
I beg your pardon.

585
00:43:58,762 --> 00:44:00,847
Hmm? Isn't that...?!

586
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:06,436
It's him! What is he saying?!

587
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:14,819
That girl over there is your girlfriend, Trunks?

588
00:44:15,028 --> 00:44:17,364
I don't know who you take after,

589
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:20,450
but you're quite the stud,
aren't you? Nice going!

590
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:22,160
Amazing, huh?

591
00:44:22,369 --> 00:44:23,620
Y-Yeah, I guess.

592
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:25,789
Call her over here for me.

593
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:30,460
<i>Yo'.!</i>

594
00:44:30,752 --> 00:44:34,547
My good lad! You just flew
through the air to get here!

595
00:44:34,756 --> 00:44:36,675
Never mind about that, I...

596
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:41,763
...was trying to act cool, and
said that you were my girlfriend.

597
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:43,098
You said I was...?

598
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:44,265
<i>N“ you'.!</i>

599
00:44:44,474 --> 00:44:45,141
Then, me?

600
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:48,061
Why would I?! This girl here!

601
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:53,358
Who, me?! Me, with a little boy like you...?

602
00:44:53,566 --> 00:44:56,528
You're a little girl, yourself, aren't you?

603
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:57,487
Oh, right.

604
00:44:57,696 --> 00:45:01,116
I hate to ask, but pretend
to be my girlfriend for a while.

605
00:45:01,324 --> 00:45:04,619
P-Pretend to be your girlfriend?
What do I have to do?

606
00:45:04,828 --> 00:45:06,996
Well, we hold hands... and stuff...

607
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:09,624
H-Hands?!

608
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:12,127
The children these days are so depraved!

609
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:14,587
You're free to eat all the food you want, too.

610
00:45:14,796 --> 00:45:16,506
Food?!

611
00:45:16,715 --> 00:45:18,633
And there's a bingo tournament, too!

612
00:45:18,842 --> 00:45:20,176
Absolutely!

613
00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:21,010
Come on!

614
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:23,138
Just a moment.

615
00:45:23,346 --> 00:45:26,307
Pilaf-sama, I know he is a child,
but holding hands with a boy

616
00:45:26,516 --> 00:45:29,310
on the very same day
I met him is something I can't...

617
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:32,397
You're actually more than
old enough for this, aren't you?

618
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:35,817
Pilaf-sama, there are some things
you can say, and some you can't!

619
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:40,238
Do it, Mai! For the food and
the bingo tournament! As well as...

620
00:45:40,447 --> 00:45:43,158
...the Dragon Balls it comes with.

621
00:45:43,366 --> 00:45:46,494
I've seen that older lady somewhere before...

622
00:45:59,048 --> 00:46:01,801
I-it was back then!

623
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:03,970
Yes, that is her, all right!

624
00:46:04,179 --> 00:46:07,390
That kid earlier and the one
who was with them back then...

625
00:46:08,558 --> 00:46:10,977
I'm getting nothing but bad feelings about this!

626
00:46:11,186 --> 00:46:12,270
Come on, let's go.

627
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:14,439
R-Right!

628
00:46:16,191 --> 00:46:19,569
<i>These "takoyaki"</i> balls <i>are fascinating.</i>

629
00:46:21,404 --> 00:46:22,614
They are quite delicious.

630
00:46:22,822 --> 00:46:26,785
Both the sauce flavor and
soy sauce flavors are fantastic.

631
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,788
So your name is Mai-chan?

632
00:46:29,996 --> 00:46:31,247
Mai-chan, how old are you?

633
00:46:31,456 --> 00:46:33,124
41.

634
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:36,669
You shouldn't tease the grown-ups!

635
00:46:41,049 --> 00:46:43,259
Ka...

636
00:46:43,468 --> 00:46:45,720


637
00:46:46,513 --> 00:46:48,807
...ha...

638
00:46:49,015 --> 00:46:50,683


639
00:46:50,892 --> 00:46:53,770
Please don't wreck anything else.

640
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:56,689
Hal!

641
00:47:17,669 --> 00:47:19,754
This is crazy!

642
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:30,682
It's no use. I can't beat
the Destroyer like this.

643
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:33,518
Beers-sama was much, much stronger.

644
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:37,605
Hey, Kaio-sama!

645
00:47:39,232 --> 00:47:42,110
It looks like a quick bit of
training ain't gonna be enough

646
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:45,572
to reach this Super Saiyan God thing.

647
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:52,996
I have to admit, I'm not seeing
any sign of this Super Saiyan God.

648
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:57,458
I was kind of looking forward to it.

649
00:47:57,667 --> 00:47:59,711
From what I hear, as far as the Saiyans go,

650
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:04,591
aside from Son Goku and Vegeta,
the others are all half-earthling.

651
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:07,760
And two of them are still just children.

652
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:13,641
Okay, next up is everyone's
favorite, the bingo tournament!

653
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:18,730
While the castle and the
airplane are both terrific prizes,

654
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:21,774
the main attraction has to be...

655
00:48:21,983 --> 00:48:25,612
Look at this! All seven Dragon Balls together!

656
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:30,283
If you win, you can have
whatever wish you want granted!

657
00:48:33,161 --> 00:48:37,957
Oh? Those balls are a lot like
Planet Namek's wish orbs, huh?

658
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:41,169
--Earth's Kami does appear to be a
Namekian, after all. --All right!

659
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:44,213
As I recall, a dragon
appears from the wish orbs,

660
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:48,301
and grants any wish they want, right?

661
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:50,595
H-Hey, just a minute!

662
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:53,306
Aren't you one Dragon Ball short?

663
00:48:54,223 --> 00:48:55,600
The Si Xing Qiu ball is gone!

664
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:58,603
No way! They were all there a little while ago!

665
00:48:58,811 --> 00:49:00,396
Hey, are you leaving already?

666
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:03,608
Mai-chan, tell me what
your cell phone number is!

667
00:49:03,816 --> 00:49:05,818
I don't have anything so fancy!

668
00:49:06,027 --> 00:49:07,654
Hold on!

669
00:49:09,238 --> 00:49:10,823
You idiot!

670
00:49:14,202 --> 00:49:16,788
O-Oh, no, I fell into their trap.

671
00:49:16,996 --> 00:49:19,290
You're the one who cried out, you know.

672
00:49:19,499 --> 00:49:21,459
At this point, there's little choice left.

673
00:49:22,335 --> 00:49:22,794
Damn it!

674
00:49:23,002 --> 00:49:23,962
P-Pilaf-sama!

675
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:28,466
H-Hey, all of you! If you
don't want this kid to get killed,

676
00:49:28,675 --> 00:49:30,969
you'll hand over one million zeni!

677
00:49:33,888 --> 00:49:36,140
Well, 100,000 zeni will be okay, too.

678
00:49:39,978 --> 00:49:42,730
Wh-What's so funny? I really will kill him!

679
00:49:42,939 --> 00:49:47,735
That child says she will kill him,
yet the others are laughing.

680
00:49:47,944 --> 00:49:49,320
Maybe they need some punishment.

681
00:49:49,529 --> 00:49:53,157
N-No! That girl is apparently
my son's girlfriend, after all!

682
00:49:53,366 --> 00:49:55,368
This is just a silly game.

683
00:49:56,244 --> 00:49:58,413
I really, really, really mean it!

684
00:49:58,621 --> 00:50:00,289
U-Um, Mai-chan...

685
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:01,541
No talking, hostage!

686
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:03,710
Your chest is touching me.

687
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:06,504
Oh, this is an entertaining side show, isn't it?

688
00:50:06,713 --> 00:50:09,841
All right, I'll play along!

689
00:50:12,135 --> 00:50:13,803
You adorable little villains!

690
00:50:14,012 --> 00:50:17,890
The Great Saiyaman does not stand for bad guys!

691
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:19,225
--Yeah! Yeah!
--Way to go!

692
00:50:19,434 --> 00:50:24,147
Seems fishy. By any chance,
is that the Super Saiyan God?

693
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:27,233
P-Please, do not get the wrong idea!
That is just Kakarrot's son,

694
00:50:27,442 --> 00:50:29,444
dressed up in a disguise!

695
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:32,280
Young lady, go ahead and try to shoot me!

696
00:50:32,488 --> 00:50:33,281
Th-That's crazy!

697
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:34,949
S-Stay back!

698
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:37,535
It really is okay for you to shoot me.

699
00:50:37,744 --> 00:50:40,079
I think that will liven things up a bit more.

700
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:44,417
I know! While you're at it,
shoot all your bullets at once at me!

701
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:46,085
Mm-hmm, that will be great!

702
00:50:46,294 --> 00:50:48,046
A-All of them?

703
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:52,592
It's no problem.
He can deflect all of them away.

704
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,720
But don't shoot at my feet or anything.
Let's keep it simple.

705
00:50:55,928 --> 00:50:57,972
Aim right for the face, okay?

706
00:50:58,181 --> 00:51:00,600
Okay, villains! Shoot as much as you like!

707
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:02,727
Okay, but you asked for it!

708
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:08,274
How do you like that, you villains?!

709
00:51:08,483 --> 00:51:11,903
Do you now realize the
power of the Great Saiyaman?!

710
00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:15,782
That's not like him. He's not
accustomed to drinking so much.

711
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:18,201
You guys, I thought that was just a toy,

712
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:20,328
but it's a real gun, isn't it?

713
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:23,331
You children shouldn't be
carrying something like that.

714
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:26,375
If it hadn't been me, this
could have been really serious.

715
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:28,002
Ee-yow!

716
00:51:29,504 --> 00:51:31,339
Videl! Videl, are you okay?

717
00:51:31,547 --> 00:51:32,965
Videl-san!

718
00:51:33,174 --> 00:51:36,219
Gohan! What's the big idea,
hittin' your own wife?

719
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:38,012
L-I'm so sorry!

720
00:51:38,221 --> 00:51:40,181
Here, let me have a look.

721
00:51:40,389 --> 00:51:42,475
Can you heal her, Turtle Hermit-san?

722
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:44,060
I'll give her mouth-to-mouth--

723
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:46,687
That has nothing to do with an injured leg!

724
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:49,565
You haven't changed at all, you dirty old man!

725
00:51:49,774 --> 00:51:53,653
N-Neither have you! How could
you do that to a great sage?!

726
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:55,613
Allow me to heal her.

727
00:51:55,822 --> 00:51:57,448
Wh-What do you think you're doing?

728
00:51:57,657 --> 00:52:00,701
You should watch what you say.
This person is Kami-sama.

729
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:03,412
K-Kami-sama? You don't mean, for real?

730
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:05,581
Are you really Kami-sama?

731
00:52:09,168 --> 00:52:10,461
It's better.

732
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:12,755
Thank you very much, Kami-sama.

733
00:52:12,964 --> 00:52:15,424
Um, your tummy is carrying...

734
00:52:16,843 --> 00:52:18,678
Shh! It's still a secret.

735
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:19,887
Oh, it is?

736
00:52:20,096 --> 00:52:23,266
Gohan, no more drinkin'
alcohol for you for a while! Got it?!

737
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:27,937
Y-Yes. Thank you, Dende--I mean, Kami-sama.

738
00:52:28,146 --> 00:52:30,022
This is a dream, right? A dream.

739
00:52:30,231 --> 00:52:34,235
But I thought we were
dreaming before, and it was all real.

740
00:52:34,443 --> 00:52:37,363
By any chance, can you deflect bullets, too?

741
00:52:37,572 --> 00:52:42,243
Of course I can. You knew that
when you started the act, right?

742
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:45,621
And you there, the dog,
you can't just stand there in a daze.

743
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:48,082
You have to hurry up and come slashing at me!

744
00:52:48,291 --> 00:52:49,876
S-Sorry.

745
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:52,420
And monkey, your intensity
leaves a lot to be desired!

746
00:52:52,628 --> 00:52:55,173
What a shame. It could have gone over better.

747
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:57,466
We'll try harder next time.

748
00:52:57,675 --> 00:53:01,762
Wh-What did you think?
That was an entertaining show, right?

749
00:53:01,971 --> 00:53:06,434
One of them came flying at me, too.

750
00:53:06,642 --> 00:53:10,897
It feels a bit itchy.
Unpleasant. Very unpleasant.

751
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:13,858
So then, will you destroy the earth?

752
00:53:14,066 --> 00:53:18,321
It might be best to renew
the whole planet at once.

753
00:53:21,991 --> 00:53:25,453
Before Creation cometh Destruction.

754
00:53:25,661 --> 00:53:28,164
Hey, come on, you guys!

755
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:31,042
That's all for the side show!

756
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:35,796
Now, let the fun of the bingo tournament begin!

757
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:38,299
<i>P</i> Bingo! <i>P</i>

758
00:53:39,425 --> 00:53:40,760
<i>P</i> Bingo! <i>P</i>

759
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:42,637
<i>P</i> Bingo! <i>P</i>

760
00:53:42,845 --> 00:53:44,305
What's come over Vegeta?

761
00:53:44,513 --> 00:53:46,015
P Fun time bingo! <i>P</i>

762
00:53:46,766 --> 00:53:51,145
<i>P</i> Earth is a fun place to be! <i>P</i>

763
00:53:51,354 --> 00:53:55,816
<i>P The food 'vs good there, too'. P</i>

764
00:53:56,025 --> 00:53:58,110
P Fun time bingo! <i>P</i>

765
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:00,780
<i>P</i> Fun time bingo! Yeah! <i>P</i>

766
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:03,908
That was somewhat engaging, huh?

767
00:54:04,116 --> 00:54:07,828
Yeah. I never figured him to
be such a poor singer and dancer.

768
00:54:08,037 --> 00:54:09,914
He could give your songs
a run for their money, Whis.

769
00:54:10,122 --> 00:54:11,415
I'm sorry to hear that.

770
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:15,962
Well, let's collect ourselves
by getting some more food.

771
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:17,421
Yeah, all right.

772
00:54:19,465 --> 00:54:21,425
Okay, that was good.

773
00:54:21,634 --> 00:54:24,470
All right, children, that Ball isn't a toy.

774
00:54:24,679 --> 00:54:26,764
You can't go carrying it
around without asking first.

775
00:54:26,973 --> 00:54:30,893
But your little skit was
kind of entertaining. Thank you.

776
00:54:31,102 --> 00:54:32,937
Okay, the Dragon Balls are all back together,

777
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:34,772
so let's start playing bingo!

778
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:42,655
I sacrificed my pride to preserve
Beers' mood, so things managed to work out.

779
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:44,740
But it shouldn't be an issue anymore.

780
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:49,412
All that's left now is to get him to
leave earth while he's still in a good mood.

781
00:54:56,877 --> 00:54:59,005
Is anyone one spot away from bingo yet?

782
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:09,098
<i>Beers-sama...</i>

783
00:55:09,307 --> 00:55:13,227
Have you tried that
dessert they call "pudding" yet?

784
00:55:13,436 --> 00:55:15,980
It truly is velvety-smooth and delicious.

785
00:55:16,188 --> 00:55:19,817
What's that? Pudding, you say?
Where exactly is it?

786
00:55:20,026 --> 00:55:21,444
Over there.

787
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:28,117
Oh my, it was here just a moment ago.

788
00:55:28,326 --> 00:55:31,287
Don't tell me you ate them all, Whis.

789
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:33,205
Indeed not!

790
00:55:36,751 --> 00:55:38,836
You there, is there any more pudding?

791
00:55:39,045 --> 00:55:44,425
L-I'm sorry, but the pudding
over there is the last of it.

792
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:53,809
You there... Would you mind
sharing one of those with me?

793
00:55:54,018 --> 00:55:56,228
Make that two--one for me.

794
00:55:58,397 --> 00:56:01,150
If not, at least let us have one, for me.

795
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:03,027
Beers-sama, that's not fair.

796
00:56:03,235 --> 00:56:05,821
You've already had one, right?

797
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:06,906
Hand it over.

798
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:08,574
Boo! No way!

799
00:56:08,783 --> 00:56:09,533
What?!

800
00:56:09,742 --> 00:56:11,160
I'm eating them all myself!

801
00:56:11,369 --> 00:56:12,787
But there are so many of them!

802
00:56:12,995 --> 00:56:14,830
All of them are mine!

803
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:18,834
Give me one!

804
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:19,668
No!

805
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:20,419
Give me one!

806
00:56:20,628 --> 00:56:21,128
No!

807
00:56:21,337 --> 00:56:24,173
Give me one, you dummy!

808
00:56:24,382 --> 00:56:25,508
You called me a dummy.

809
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:28,052
I'm gonna turn you to candy and eat'cha!

810
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:31,013
Oh, no! I look away for one second, and...!

811
00:56:31,222 --> 00:56:33,933
Now I'm completely upset!

812
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:47,071
Hey!

813
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:50,199
What did you do that for?!

814
00:56:54,954 --> 00:56:56,497
Beers-sama! Please stop!

815
00:56:56,705 --> 00:56:59,834
S-Stop him!

816
00:57:12,888 --> 00:57:14,098
<i>Ten-san'.!</i>

817
00:57:14,306 --> 00:57:16,559
He's out of this world!

818
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:18,811
Kuririn-san, get the others out of here!

819
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:20,604
Y-Yeah...

820
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:30,948
Are you all right?

821
00:57:31,407 --> 00:57:33,701
Goten! Get her two friends!

822
00:57:33,909 --> 00:57:35,286
Uh-huh!

823
00:57:42,001 --> 00:57:44,753
You wouldn't give me any pudding,
so I'm gonna hurt you some more.

824
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:46,505
Stop!

825
00:57:55,431 --> 00:57:58,100
Damn it! It doesn't matter anymore!

826
00:58:01,562 --> 00:58:03,522
This way, Beers!

827
00:58:23,542 --> 00:58:24,960
Thanks for waiting.

828
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:31,884
Ho! This tastes absolutely delicious!

829
00:58:32,092 --> 00:58:33,594
What do you call this food?

830
00:58:33,802 --> 00:58:37,097
Huh? O-Oh, it's called sushi.

831
00:58:37,306 --> 00:58:39,183
Oh, yum.

832
00:58:45,814 --> 00:58:48,359
He beat Vegeta in the blink of an eye!

833
00:58:48,567 --> 00:58:50,319
Mai, wait here a minute.

834
00:58:50,528 --> 00:58:51,445
Goten!

835
00:58:51,654 --> 00:58:53,822
I know!

836
00:58:57,785 --> 00:58:59,537
Fu--

837
00:58:59,745 --> 00:59:02,164
--$ion! Ha!

838
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:06,752
Yay!

839
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:12,424
G-Goten has gone and turned delinquent again!

840
00:59:12,633 --> 00:59:15,719
His fighting senses, at least, are pretty good.

841
00:59:15,928 --> 00:59:17,972
Hey, you! The cat-person!

842
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:20,432
Cause a big ruckus over pudding, will you?!

843
00:59:20,641 --> 00:59:24,937
Anyone who has manners that
bad gets their butt kicked by Gotenks!

844
00:59:25,145 --> 00:59:26,397
What did you say?

845
00:59:26,605 --> 00:59:29,775
You earthlings are probably
accustomed to eating it,

846
00:59:29,984 --> 00:59:33,946
but for me, it's an unknown food,
whose flavor I can't even guess!

847
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:39,827
Pudding! Even the naming
makes it sound delicious, doesn't it?!

848
00:59:40,035 --> 00:59:42,538
Y-You hush!

849
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:45,874
Don't! You're no match for him!

850
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:50,462
Ow! Ow!

851
00:59:53,299 --> 00:59:55,593
<i>I'm sorry'.</i>

852
01:00:09,607 --> 01:00:12,985
I imagined that you'd be beyond the pale,

853
01:00:13,193 --> 01:00:16,071
but I never thought our
levels would be this far removed.

854
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,617
Damn, the end is finally here.

855
01:00:19,825 --> 01:00:21,744
You run out of pudding,

856
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:24,913
and the Super Saiyan God isn't here.

857
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:26,999
I guess it's time for destruction.

858
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:37,926
Hmph, it might be an honor to be
eliminated by Beers the Destroyer.

859
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:41,722
Oh, well isn't that a nice thing to say?

860
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:44,808
All right then, as you wish...

861
01:00:45,017 --> 01:00:47,436
Hey, that's enough of that already!

862
01:00:47,645 --> 01:00:50,564
I don't care if you're a
friend of Vegeta's or not,

863
01:00:50,773 --> 01:00:54,068
but you've turned my 38th
birthday upside-down, you know!

864
01:00:54,276 --> 01:00:56,612
38th, is it?

865
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:09,917
H-How dare you... hit my... Bulma!!

866
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:16,548
You filthy bastard!

867
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:31,480
This is incredible!

868
01:01:31,689 --> 01:01:35,484
I think Vegeta has finally
surpassed Goku, hasn't he?

869
01:01:42,825 --> 01:01:44,118
Take this!

870
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:52,960
Wh-What's that?

871
01:01:55,087 --> 01:01:59,758
Are they launching off extra-large
fireworks at the Capsule Corporation again?

872
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:03,011
Well?

873
01:02:08,225 --> 01:02:12,312
Sure enough, that doesn't seem
to be Super Saiyan God, either.

874
01:02:12,521 --> 01:02:15,023
Enough, already. I'm going to
destroy the earth and head back.

875
01:02:15,232 --> 01:02:16,650
Whis!

876
01:02:16,859 --> 01:02:18,485
Just a moment!

877
01:02:18,694 --> 01:02:20,946
So it's a sea urchin battleship roll?

878
01:02:21,155 --> 01:02:23,282
This is quite delicious, too.

879
01:02:24,867 --> 01:02:26,785
L-I won't let you do it!

880
01:02:26,994 --> 01:02:28,662
You're always "destroy this," "destroy that"!

881
01:02:28,871 --> 01:02:32,458
Let it go. I told you, it's already over.

882
01:02:36,712 --> 01:02:38,046
Vegeta!

883
01:02:39,214 --> 01:02:40,466
Vegeta!

884
01:02:42,176 --> 01:02:43,802
Whis, I say!

885
01:02:45,304 --> 01:02:47,514
You called, Beers-sama?

886
01:02:47,723 --> 01:02:51,977
It looks like this Super Saiyan
God is just a pointless dream,

887
01:02:52,186 --> 01:02:54,438
like you said it was.

888
01:02:54,646 --> 01:02:57,441
And I'll say it again! I'm gonna
destroy the earth and head back!

889
01:02:57,649 --> 01:03:01,570
As you wish. But could you
please wait a little while longer?

890
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:05,324
H-How is the tuna roll?

891
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:06,700
Fantastic!

892
01:03:06,909 --> 01:03:09,995
Incidentally, I don't seem
to have very much time.

893
01:03:10,204 --> 01:03:12,873
Could you wrap some of this up to go?

894
01:03:23,759 --> 01:03:29,181
Um, the earth is, I suppose,
enjoyable in some aspects,

895
01:03:29,389 --> 01:03:32,267
so I will give you one last chance.

896
01:03:33,101 --> 01:03:34,770
You, over there!

897
01:03:39,316 --> 01:03:41,276
Yes, you there! You!

898
01:03:41,485 --> 01:03:43,195
M-Me?

899
01:03:43,403 --> 01:03:46,365
Yes. You, the tasty-looking one.

900
01:03:48,408 --> 01:03:49,952
H-He's gonna eat me!

901
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,870
Come over here.

902
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:54,998
L-I'm yucky! I taste incredibly yucky!

903
01:03:55,207 --> 01:03:59,962
Rock-paper-scissors with me,
and if you win, I will leave.

904
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:04,174
But if I win, I will destroy the earth.

905
01:04:04,383 --> 01:04:05,551
R-Rock-paper-scissors?

906
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:07,302
Destroy the earth?

907
01:04:08,762 --> 01:04:11,348
No way! I'm lousy at rock-paper-scissors!

908
01:04:11,557 --> 01:04:14,101
The fate of the earth has been entrusted to you!

909
01:04:14,309 --> 01:04:18,272
This is your first big role, isn't it?
If you lose, you're to blame.

910
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,274
P-Pu-erh, I'll get you!

911
01:04:20,482 --> 01:04:23,068
Ah! So that's it! Hey, I get it!

912
01:04:23,277 --> 01:04:26,363
I know why you're the one he picked, Oolong!

913
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:31,118
He thinks that you're just an ordinary pig!

914
01:04:31,326 --> 01:04:34,246
And as a pig, he thinks
you can only throw scissors!

915
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:36,915
However, you're a pig-man!

916
01:04:37,124 --> 01:04:39,751
He doesn't realize you can
also throw rock and paper!

917
01:04:40,711 --> 01:04:42,588
He's sure to throw rock,

918
01:04:42,796 --> 01:04:45,924
so Oolong, if you throw paper, you'll win!

919
01:04:48,135 --> 01:04:52,681
L-I get it! A-All right! L-Let's do this!

920
01:04:53,098 --> 01:04:54,349
Are you ready yet?

921
01:04:54,558 --> 01:04:56,643
Y-Yeah!

922
01:04:56,852 --> 01:04:58,687
All right...

923
01:04:58,896 --> 01:05:01,315
--Rock-paper-scissors!
--Rock-paper-scissors!

924
01:05:07,195 --> 01:05:10,741
Fools! I heard your whole strategy.

925
01:05:34,222 --> 01:05:35,474
Wait!

926
01:05:40,145 --> 01:05:40,604
Goku!

927
01:05:40,812 --> 01:05:42,272
Goku-sa!

928
01:05:49,321 --> 01:05:50,614
Goku!

929
01:05:50,822 --> 01:05:52,074
<i>Son-kun'.!</i>

930
01:05:59,331 --> 01:06:02,042
You, again? What do you want?

931
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:04,795
Did you get a handle on
what this "God" thing is?

932
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:10,092
That's still a mystery,
but don't destroy this planet.

933
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:13,178
I am a god of destruction.

934
01:06:13,387 --> 01:06:18,475
I know that, Beers-sama.
But just this once, give us a pass.

935
01:06:18,684 --> 01:06:21,728
And do what? Are you going to fight me again?

936
01:06:21,937 --> 01:06:26,149
I'd like to say I will,
but you've got me in a bind.

937
01:06:26,358 --> 01:06:30,487
To be honest, no matter what I do,
I ain't gonna be able to beat--

938
01:06:30,696 --> 01:06:32,322
That's it!

939
01:06:32,531 --> 01:06:35,742
Beers-sama, is it okay if
I try my luck at something?

940
01:06:35,951 --> 01:06:36,994
For what?

941
01:06:37,202 --> 01:06:40,163
You know, that Super Saiyan God thing.

942
01:06:40,372 --> 01:06:43,208
There just might be a chance of getting one!

943
01:06:43,417 --> 01:06:44,501
How so?

944
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:49,172
Would you give me just a little
bit of time? Just a little? Okay?

945
01:06:49,381 --> 01:06:50,549
Please!

946
01:06:50,757 --> 01:06:53,510
Very well. But just a little.

947
01:06:53,719 --> 01:06:54,845
Thank you!

948
01:07:01,059 --> 01:07:04,646
Bulma! I'm gonna have to use the Dragon Balls!

949
01:07:04,855 --> 01:07:08,650
That's fine. If it's going to put
that dumb rude jerk in his place,

950
01:07:08,859 --> 01:07:10,235
then use them all you want!

951
01:07:10,444 --> 01:07:13,697
That's a spiteful thing to say.
The man is a deity!

952
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:15,490
Huh? A deity?

953
01:07:16,616 --> 01:07:17,492
Yeah.

954
01:07:17,701 --> 01:07:19,911
So? If you're a deity,
then don't go pitching fits

955
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:22,581
over something like pudding, you dummy!

956
01:07:23,707 --> 01:07:25,667
He's no ordinary deity.

957
01:07:25,876 --> 01:07:29,796
He's a god of destruction,
the most terrible kind in the world.

958
01:07:30,005 --> 01:07:33,800
His name is Beers-sama.
He's the strongest guy in the universe.

959
01:07:34,009 --> 01:07:37,888
Strong enough that he scares the
crap out of Kaio-sama and Kaioshin-sama.

960
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:42,976
Everyone, please mind your manner of speech.

961
01:07:43,185 --> 01:07:45,228
If you happen to offend Beers-sama,

962
01:07:45,437 --> 01:07:49,524
you will be destroyed, along
with the entire solar system.

963
01:07:49,733 --> 01:07:51,109
B-Beers-sama!

964
01:07:51,318 --> 01:07:53,570
S-Stop that! It has the opposite
effect with middle-aged women!

965
01:07:53,779 --> 01:07:55,530
“Shut up!
“OW!

966
01:07:56,782 --> 01:08:00,535
Goku, what are you going
to do with the Dragon Balls?!

967
01:08:00,744 --> 01:08:05,415
Come forth, Shen Long! And grant me my wish!

968
01:08:07,042 --> 01:08:08,877
So that's it! You're thinking
of having Shen Long

969
01:08:09,086 --> 01:08:10,587
put a stop to the destruction of the earth!

970
01:08:10,796 --> 01:08:11,505
Nope.

971
01:08:11,713 --> 01:08:13,381
That would be too much for him.

972
01:08:29,314 --> 01:08:32,234
The Capsule Corporation, huh?

973
01:08:32,442 --> 01:08:35,695
Rich people have the wildest attractions, huh?

974
01:08:36,655 --> 01:08:41,118
I shall grant thee any wish. Now, speak!

975
01:08:41,326 --> 01:08:43,745
Listen, Shen Long...

976
01:08:43,954 --> 01:08:47,582
Um... do you know what a Super Saiyan God is?

977
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:49,459
Huh? What's that?

978
01:08:49,668 --> 01:08:53,672
Ho, that's the same
question that I was going to ask.

979
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,382
Yeah, I do know.

980
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:57,884
Huh? You know it? Really?

981
01:08:58,093 --> 01:09:03,223
Really. ls your wish
whether or not I really know?

982
01:09:03,431 --> 01:09:04,516
No. no, no, no, no.

983
01:09:04,724 --> 01:09:07,769
If you know, then could
you bring one here for us?

984
01:09:07,978 --> 01:09:12,357
I cannot bring one, for one does not exist.

985
01:09:12,566 --> 01:09:15,318
Super Saiyan God is a deity

986
01:09:15,527 --> 01:09:19,447
that can only be formed by Saiyans temporarily.

987
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:21,533
What do you mean by that?

988
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:26,413
You are asking many questions.
What exactly is your wish?

989
01:09:26,621 --> 01:09:30,542
Beers-sama says to produce a Super Saiyan God.

990
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:34,337
Hm? Ah, B-Beers-sama?!

991
01:09:34,546 --> 01:09:36,840
Why, it is Beers-sama! Pleased to meet you!

992
01:09:37,048 --> 01:09:41,052
Tell them how to form a Super Saiyan God.

993
01:09:41,261 --> 01:09:42,512
Er, right!

994
01:09:42,721 --> 01:09:45,891
I've never seen Shen Long like this.

995
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:49,436
A Super Saiyan God is a savior,

996
01:09:49,644 --> 01:09:53,732
created by chance by a
handful of righteous Saiyans,

997
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:58,069
who long ago questioned the
evil acts of their fellow Saiyans,

998
01:09:58,278 --> 01:10:01,031
and led a revolt against them.

999
01:10:01,865 --> 01:10:04,367
This savior had immense power,

1000
01:10:04,576 --> 01:10:08,205
and dispatched the evil
Saiyans in no time at all,

1001
01:10:08,413 --> 01:10:10,999
but shortly thereafter, they returned to normal,

1002
01:10:11,208 --> 01:10:14,127
with their power apparently used up.

1003
01:10:14,336 --> 01:10:18,381
Once again, Planet Vegeta
became a world of evil Saiyans,

1004
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:23,053
and the savior was also
eliminated from their legends.

1005
01:10:23,261 --> 01:10:25,430
This vanished legend goes...

1006
01:10:25,639 --> 01:10:29,017
This story sure is long, huh?
Are you getting this, Vegeta?

1007
01:10:29,226 --> 01:10:30,977
Shh! Keep quiet!

1008
01:10:31,186 --> 01:10:35,482
..."Five Saiyans who possess
righteous hearts join hands,

1009
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:39,861
and by instilling light into
another righteous Saiyan,

1010
01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:43,406
they will become a Saiyan god."

1011
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:48,203
I have now told you the method. Farewell.

1012
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:50,247
Please excuse me.

1013
01:10:57,045 --> 01:11:00,548
Five Saiyans who possess righteous hearts?

1014
01:11:00,757 --> 01:11:02,592
Hmph, that's impossible.

1015
01:11:02,801 --> 01:11:05,929
The only two Saiyans like
that are Gohan and Goten.

1016
01:11:06,137 --> 01:11:09,599
How rude of you! While we may
not be able to say much about Vegeta,

1017
01:11:09,808 --> 01:11:12,560
Trunks has a righteous heart, doesn't he?

1018
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:17,482
Ha! Any kid his age that
already has a girlfriend is impure.

1019
01:11:17,691 --> 01:11:19,734
My, you sound like an old fogey!

1020
01:11:19,943 --> 01:11:22,028
Are you sure you're not just jealous?

1021
01:11:22,237 --> 01:11:27,117
Yeah, Piccolo-san! Are you
sayin' Goku-sa is impure, too?

1022
01:11:27,325 --> 01:11:30,453
Hmm, it's true that Goku may be pure,

1023
01:11:30,662 --> 01:11:32,539
but he's purely a fool for fighting.

1024
01:11:32,747 --> 01:11:35,709
Whether that counts as a
pure heart is a subtle distinction.

1025
01:11:35,917 --> 01:11:37,294
Shut your mouth, you dirty old geezer!

1026
01:11:37,502 --> 01:11:40,130
Wh-What did you call me?!
Such a thing to call a sage!

1027
01:11:40,338 --> 01:11:44,134
Hurry up and give rise to a Super Saiyan God!

1028
01:11:48,722 --> 01:11:53,184
Um, broadly speaking,
don't all five of the Saiyans here

1029
01:11:53,393 --> 01:11:57,689
possess hearts that are righteous?

1030
01:11:57,897 --> 01:11:59,441
Hmm? Even Vegeta?

1031
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:01,026
Don't you judge me!

1032
01:12:01,234 --> 01:12:05,030
Vegeta-san may have been evil a long time ago,

1033
01:12:05,238 --> 01:12:07,574
but I'm not so sure about now. Is he evil?

1034
01:12:07,782 --> 01:12:09,576
Now that you mention it, you're right.

1035
01:12:09,784 --> 01:12:13,830
He hasn't done anything
bad for a good while now.

1036
01:12:14,998 --> 01:12:16,124
Stop insulting me!

1037
01:12:16,333 --> 01:12:19,127
You're saying the great
Vegeta-sama has a righteous heart?!

1038
01:12:19,336 --> 01:12:22,672
It doesn't matter,
just hurry up and give it a try!

1039
01:12:39,481 --> 01:12:41,983
Why does Kakarrot get to be the main one?

1040
01:12:42,192 --> 01:12:43,735
Quit complaining!

1041
01:12:44,444 --> 01:12:47,614
Father, h-has there been any change?

1042
01:12:47,822 --> 01:12:50,450
W-Well, I ain't sure.

1043
01:12:50,658 --> 01:12:52,285
There, thanks for waiting.

1044
01:12:52,494 --> 01:12:55,121
These are called tempura prawns, are they?

1045
01:13:06,674 --> 01:13:08,134
That's good, too.

1046
01:13:14,724 --> 01:13:16,643
Oh, they did <i>m.</i>

1047
01:13:20,021 --> 01:13:21,981
Well, Kakarrot?

1048
01:13:24,401 --> 01:13:27,237
Father, you have an outstanding battle power.

1049
01:13:29,072 --> 01:13:31,699
Goku has finally gone and become a god!

1050
01:13:31,908 --> 01:13:34,536
Son-kun! Go ahead and show him!

1051
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:36,663
Don't bother, Goku!

1052
01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:41,459
It won't do any good to fight him.
That was not godly.

1053
01:13:41,668 --> 01:13:43,002
B-But...

1054
01:13:43,211 --> 01:13:45,296
The reason your battle power went up

1055
01:13:45,505 --> 01:13:48,633
is due to nothing more than
collecting energy from the others.

1056
01:13:50,009 --> 01:13:52,971
He's correct in saying so.
If all you have is battle power

1057
01:13:53,179 --> 01:13:56,224
that appears superficially,
you can't call it godly.

1058
01:13:56,433 --> 01:13:58,810
Ah, that makes sense.

1059
01:13:59,018 --> 01:14:02,397
Yeah, you're right. I don't feel
like I could beat you, Beers-sama.

1060
01:14:02,605 --> 01:14:03,857
Oh, no...

1061
01:14:06,818 --> 01:14:10,697
Listen closely, everyone.
Please remember what he said.

1062
01:14:10,905 --> 01:14:13,950
The light from five of you
is instilled into one other.

1063
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:18,079
The total number of Saiyans
you need is six, is it not?

1064
01:14:18,288 --> 01:14:21,249
Oh, so that's it! We goofed up!

1065
01:14:21,458 --> 01:14:25,295
Six? Then, one other... one other...

1066
01:14:25,503 --> 01:14:26,004
That's it!

1067
01:14:26,212 --> 01:14:29,132
Vegeta, you've got an on-the-level
younger brother, don't you?

1068
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:33,052
On a faraway planet. What's worse,
I don't even know where it is.

1069
01:14:33,261 --> 01:14:35,680
You didn't even get his cell phone number?

1070
01:14:35,889 --> 01:14:39,392
Enough! I was looking forward
to an interesting development,

1071
01:14:39,601 --> 01:14:42,270
but you've disappointed me.
I'm starting to get drowsy,

1072
01:14:42,479 --> 01:14:45,565
so I'll destroy the earth
right now, and head home.

1073
01:14:45,773 --> 01:14:48,485
E-Excuse me! There is one other!

1074
01:14:49,694 --> 01:14:51,905
Videl-san? What other one?

1075
01:14:52,113 --> 01:14:54,782
<i>Um, not quite another one,</i>

1076
01:14:54,991 --> 01:14:57,160
but soon to be another one, you might say.

1077
01:14:57,368 --> 01:15:00,955
But it definitely has Saiyan blood.

1078
01:15:01,164 --> 01:15:04,417
What are you talking about, Videl?
Your papa may be a great man,

1079
01:15:04,626 --> 01:15:06,336
but I'm a full-blooded earthling!

1080
01:15:06,544 --> 01:15:08,171
I'm not talking about you, Papa!

1081
01:15:08,379 --> 01:15:13,676
Um, Videl-san has a baby inside her tummy.

1082
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:19,557
D-Do you mean it?!

1083
01:15:19,766 --> 01:15:20,975
I do.

1084
01:15:21,184 --> 01:15:23,478
I didn't say anything, because
I wanted to surprise you, Gohan-kun.

1085
01:15:23,686 --> 01:15:24,979
Hooray!

1086
01:15:25,188 --> 01:15:27,357
--Wow!
--Congratulations!

1087
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:35,240
Are you turning God, or not?

1088
01:15:35,448 --> 01:15:38,660
C-Come on, let's add
Videl-san, and try it again!

1089
01:15:38,868 --> 01:15:39,994
Mm-hmm!

1090
01:15:40,203 --> 01:15:43,498
Will this even work?
It hasn't even been born yet.

1091
01:15:43,706 --> 01:15:46,084
We've got nothing to
lose, so let's just try it!

1092
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:47,335
Right.

1093
01:16:05,562 --> 01:16:07,564
Maybe it's not going to work after all...

1094
01:17:09,042 --> 01:17:11,461
Hey, that's the same
old Goku as always, right?

1095
01:17:11,669 --> 01:17:14,589
But look at him. His hair is red!

1096
01:17:14,797 --> 01:17:17,925
You're right. He also looks a bit thinner.

1097
01:17:18,134 --> 01:17:20,845
I can't tell what Goku's battle power is.

1098
01:17:21,054 --> 01:17:24,724
Congratulations.
It appears they were successful.

1099
01:17:24,932 --> 01:17:27,435
It was worth waiting so very patiently.

1100
01:17:27,644 --> 01:17:31,856
Really? Have I become a Super Saiyan God?

1101
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:35,276
We should know once we start fighting.

1102
01:17:35,485 --> 01:17:37,487
Now, come and fight me.

1103
01:17:37,695 --> 01:17:39,906
All right! Well, here I come!

1104
01:17:40,114 --> 01:17:45,662
Sure. If you're the stronger one,
I won't destroy the earth for you.

1105
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:48,498
Huh? You mean it? Thanks so much!

1106
01:17:48,706 --> 01:17:50,750
Okay, everyone, this will be dangerous,

1107
01:17:50,958 --> 01:17:53,044
so please give them a little more room.

1108
01:18:58,693 --> 01:19:02,405
Well? What are your
impressions on being a god?

1109
01:19:02,613 --> 01:19:03,740
I'm stunned.

1110
01:19:03,948 --> 01:19:06,033
I see. You're surprised.

1111
01:19:08,578 --> 01:19:11,414
That's the same impression I had.

1112
01:19:49,285 --> 01:19:51,829
Good. Keep that up.

1113
01:19:53,790 --> 01:19:56,793
What's wrong? You seem dissatisfied.

1114
01:19:57,001 --> 01:19:58,252
A little.

1115
01:19:58,461 --> 01:20:00,505
You don't care to be a god?

1116
01:20:00,713 --> 01:20:04,133
Nope. I never knew there was a world like this.

1117
01:20:04,342 --> 01:20:06,052
What do you mean?

1118
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:08,805
A world that I couldn't come to by myself.

1119
01:20:09,013 --> 01:20:10,807
And you're unhappy with that?

1120
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:13,768
Yeah. I ain't happy!

1121
01:20:23,402 --> 01:20:24,654
Hmm? What's that?

1122
01:20:24,862 --> 01:20:26,072
An earthquake?

1123
01:20:28,032 --> 01:20:30,159
You say such interesting things.

1124
01:20:30,368 --> 01:20:35,206
You don't like working with
your friends to become a god?!

1125
01:20:36,707 --> 01:20:41,754
Oh, I'm happy. I'm happy,
but without using everyone else's power,

1126
01:20:41,963 --> 01:20:45,007
I couldn't fight with
you like this, Beers-sama!

1127
01:20:45,216 --> 01:20:46,843
That frustrates me!

1128
01:20:47,051 --> 01:20:50,346
Then why did you turn God?

1129
01:20:50,555 --> 01:20:53,474
Because I wanted to fight you, Beers-sama.

1130
01:20:53,975 --> 01:20:56,978
You really are a fool for fighting, huh?

1131
01:20:57,186 --> 01:20:58,938
I get that a lot.

1132
01:21:18,583 --> 01:21:19,709
Let's follow them!

1133
01:21:19,917 --> 01:21:21,252
Right!

1134
01:21:33,222 --> 01:21:34,390
Here we go!

1135
01:21:48,571 --> 01:21:49,989
They're ramping it up!

1136
01:22:17,433 --> 01:22:18,768
Excuse me.

1137
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:25,399
I beg your pardon.
What is this mysterious, delicious item?

1138
01:22:25,608 --> 01:22:29,028
Huh? Oh, it's ice cream.

1139
01:22:29,236 --> 01:22:35,660
Ice cream? How novel!
Imagine, making food this cold!

1140
01:22:35,868 --> 01:22:38,412
Exactly how does one make it?

1141
01:22:38,621 --> 01:22:40,164
L-I don't know.

1142
01:22:40,373 --> 01:22:44,919
Oh, my. A reply as cold as this ice cream.

1143
01:22:47,588 --> 01:22:51,384
Well? That was a pretty good one, wasn't it?

1144
01:22:57,431 --> 01:23:00,142
It looks like they're having
a pretty wicked fight, huh?

1145
01:23:00,351 --> 01:23:05,815
Th-That bastard! He always snaps up
the best of things for himself!

1146
01:23:06,023 --> 01:23:06,816
But still...

1147
01:23:07,024 --> 01:23:09,610
Wh-What?

1148
01:23:11,612 --> 01:23:13,280
I'm glad that's not me.

1149
01:23:13,489 --> 01:23:14,490
Huh?

1150
01:23:26,585 --> 01:23:28,671
Are you still unhappy with being a god?

1151
01:23:28,879 --> 01:23:29,922
A bit!

1152
01:23:33,843 --> 01:23:36,554
That pride will prove to be a weakness!

1153
01:23:56,949 --> 01:23:58,909
Good-for-nothing pride!

1154
01:24:00,578 --> 01:24:04,248
It's rare that a Saiyan
would be so hung up on it.

1155
01:24:11,422 --> 01:24:13,841
Wh-What power!

1156
01:24:19,555 --> 01:24:26,228
That ain't true. Vegeta has
far more pride than even I do.

1157
01:24:26,437 --> 01:24:27,772
Hmph, now that you mention it,

1158
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:32,234
he forsook his pride earlier,
to protect the others.

1159
01:24:32,443 --> 01:24:36,530
I know. He forsook even
his pride as the prince.

1160
01:24:36,739 --> 01:24:40,326
Ain't that amazing?
I kind of respect him for that.

1161
01:24:41,702 --> 01:24:45,915
And that's why you also forsook
your pride to turn God, right?

1162
01:24:46,957 --> 01:24:48,417
That's right.

1163
01:24:48,626 --> 01:24:51,754
I wonder what those two are talking about.

1164
01:24:51,962 --> 01:24:55,633
It's almost as though
Goku were receiving training.

1165
01:24:57,343 --> 01:25:00,387
I should also say that there's
something I'm dissatisfied with.

1166
01:25:00,596 --> 01:25:02,765
Huh? What's that?

1167
01:25:02,973 --> 01:25:06,644
I still haven't even come
close to fighting all-out.

1168
01:25:06,852 --> 01:25:10,606
Oh, really? I was going at
about 80 percent of all-out.

1169
01:25:10,815 --> 01:25:13,025
Huh? 80 percent?

1170
01:25:14,735 --> 01:25:18,155
Then let's see if you can
keep up with this speed!

1171
01:25:29,959 --> 01:25:32,169
What's the matter?
Do you mean business yet?

1172
01:25:32,378 --> 01:25:35,172
Yeah! I mean business!

1173
01:25:53,566 --> 01:25:55,776
What's this? Using blasts now?!

1174
01:26:00,281 --> 01:26:03,200
Ha! This isn't some sporting event!

1175
01:26:21,969 --> 01:26:25,639
Stop enjoying destroying things!

1176
01:26:48,078 --> 01:26:53,250
He's not God!
He's reverted to a mere Super Saiyan!

1177
01:27:17,483 --> 01:27:20,069
C-Can you see them, Kuririn?

1178
01:27:20,277 --> 01:27:21,570
No, I can't.

1179
01:27:27,785 --> 01:27:30,871
If you're gonna start
using blasts against me...

1180
01:27:33,415 --> 01:27:35,459
...then I...

1181
01:27:35,668 --> 01:27:38,295
...have one for you!

1182
01:27:40,005 --> 01:27:42,299
Go ahead. Feel free.

1183
01:27:48,055 --> 01:27:50,641
Hal!

1184
01:27:54,979 --> 01:27:57,523
That's Goku's Kamehame-Ha!

1185
01:28:05,155 --> 01:28:07,157
Hmm? What's that?

1186
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:18,294
I'll return the favor!

1187
01:28:22,339 --> 01:28:24,883
I'll take it, just like this!

1188
01:28:35,269 --> 01:28:37,730
Wh-What is that?

1189
01:28:37,938 --> 01:28:41,025
Beers' attack! Th-This is bad!

1190
01:28:45,988 --> 01:28:48,365
Damn it...!

1191
01:28:51,368 --> 01:28:54,204
Apparently, you haven't realized it, yourself.

1192
01:28:54,413 --> 01:28:55,914
Wh-What?

1193
01:28:56,123 --> 01:28:59,460
Your Super Saiyan God
time ran out a good while ago.

1194
01:28:59,668 --> 01:29:02,212
R-Really?

1195
01:29:04,465 --> 01:29:06,133
B-But...

1196
01:29:06,342 --> 01:29:10,012
It seems as though while you
had turned God and were fighting me,

1197
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:14,308
you absorbed that world into your body.

1198
01:29:14,516 --> 01:29:16,602
Which is why, even though
you've returned to normal,

1199
01:29:16,810 --> 01:29:21,231
you haven't powered down all
that much. You're something else.

1200
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:24,068
I might even say you're one
of those rarely-seen prodigies.

1201
01:29:24,276 --> 01:29:27,029
If that's true, then I'm glad...

1202
01:29:27,237 --> 01:29:31,200
Then openly recognize that joy.
That's what you wanted, isn't it?

1203
01:29:31,408 --> 01:29:35,662
I can't do that. The first
matter at hand right now...

1204
01:29:35,871 --> 01:29:39,792
...is still how huge the
difference in our powers is!

1205
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,878
Then give up and bow out!

1206
01:30:32,511 --> 01:30:34,346
What is going on?

1207
01:30:50,654 --> 01:30:52,406
Damn it...!

1208
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:03,792
Goku-sa!

1209
01:31:04,001 --> 01:31:06,128
--Goku!
--Kakarrot!
--Father!

1210
01:31:48,921 --> 01:31:51,673
Hey, what did you just do?

1211
01:31:51,882 --> 01:31:54,384
L-I don't know.

1212
01:31:55,552 --> 01:31:57,888
You don't know?

1213
01:31:58,096 --> 01:32:00,057
You are a fascinating one.

1214
01:32:16,657 --> 01:32:19,243
What? Why did you stop?

1215
01:32:19,451 --> 01:32:22,538
I wanted to get you to say "I give up."

1216
01:32:24,206 --> 01:32:27,960
I give up. I give "P!

1217
01:32:28,168 --> 01:32:29,878
Beers-same, you sure are strong.

1218
01:32:30,087 --> 01:32:32,548
There ain't no way I could stand up to you.

1219
01:32:32,756 --> 01:32:34,716
You're the strongest
in the universe, all right.

1220
01:32:34,925 --> 01:32:39,888
It looks like you finally realize
the terror of Beers the Destroyer.

1221
01:32:40,097 --> 01:32:43,642
However, you are definitely strong, yourself.

1222
01:32:43,850 --> 01:32:47,354
In the long, long history
of fights I've been through,

1223
01:32:47,563 --> 01:32:49,398
you are the second-strongest.

1224
01:32:49,606 --> 01:32:53,110
Huh? Wh-What, only second place?

1225
01:32:55,028 --> 01:32:59,032
All right, let me tell you one last thing...

1226
01:32:59,241 --> 01:33:03,203
What? That you've
decided not to destroy earth?

1227
01:33:03,412 --> 01:33:04,621
No, I can't do that.

1228
01:33:04,830 --> 01:33:08,458
I make it a rule not to
change my mind once it's made up.

1229
01:33:08,667 --> 01:33:10,919
Then, wh-what...?

1230
01:33:11,128 --> 01:33:15,048
My attendant, a man named
Whis, is over there, right?

1231
01:33:15,257 --> 01:33:17,593
Huh? Y-Yeah...

1232
01:33:21,305 --> 01:33:25,434
While he may be my
attendant, he is also my teacher.

1233
01:33:25,642 --> 01:33:29,980
Eh? T-Teacher?! Then, the
strongest one in the universe is...

1234
01:33:31,481 --> 01:33:34,401
This world is the "7th Universe."

1235
01:33:34,610 --> 01:33:37,779
I am the Destroyer for the 7th Universe.

1236
01:33:37,988 --> 01:33:41,700
There are 12 universes in all, you see.

1237
01:33:41,908 --> 01:33:45,329
Don't you expect that there are
even more fantastic guys out there?

1238
01:34:05,599 --> 01:34:06,516
Goku-sa!

1239
01:34:06,725 --> 01:34:08,143
--Goku!
--Son-kun!

1240
01:34:09,853 --> 01:34:13,315
L-I'm all right. I'm still alive.

1241
01:34:13,523 --> 01:34:17,861
Well then, as promised,
I will now destroy earth.

1242
01:34:46,098 --> 01:34:51,103
Oh my, Beers-sama, you destroyed
just a small piece of earth, huh?

1243
01:34:51,311 --> 01:34:56,233
Hmph, that's too bad. I guess
I don't have enough strength left.

1244
01:34:56,441 --> 01:35:00,028
I'll have to destroy it
completely some other time.

1245
01:35:00,237 --> 01:35:01,655
<i>Beers-sama...</i>

1246
01:35:03,073 --> 01:35:05,492
You there, when Beers-sama passes away,

1247
01:35:05,701 --> 01:35:07,703
would you be the next Destroyer?

1248
01:35:07,911 --> 01:35:09,121
Hey!

1249
01:35:09,329 --> 01:35:10,914
I'm afraid not.

1250
01:35:11,123 --> 01:35:12,541
That's too bad.

1251
01:35:12,749 --> 01:35:14,000
Mrs. Vegeta...

1252
01:35:14,209 --> 01:35:17,754
Huh? Me? Wh-What?

1253
01:35:17,963 --> 01:35:20,882
I'm sorry for all the commotion.

1254
01:35:21,091 --> 01:35:24,177
Never mind that, apologize for hitting me!

1255
01:35:24,845 --> 01:35:26,179
S-Sorry.

1256
01:35:26,388 --> 01:35:28,265
Hey, what are you, dim?!

1257
01:35:28,473 --> 01:35:31,017
If you don't mind, please
invite us to your next party.

1258
01:35:31,226 --> 01:35:34,104
If you promise not to act up.

1259
01:35:34,312 --> 01:35:38,692
Agreed. And this time, I'm going
to have some of that pudding.

1260
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:41,361
I'll have the whole pool
filled and ready for you.

1261
01:35:41,570 --> 01:35:44,823
However, don't go telling me
you don't like it after you eat it.

1262
01:35:45,031 --> 01:35:48,410
If I don't like it, I really will
destroy the earth this time.

1263
01:35:48,618 --> 01:35:52,038
Then we'll get to fight
again, right, Beers-sama?

1264
01:35:52,956 --> 01:35:54,124
Farewell.

1265
01:36:10,348 --> 01:36:11,933
Unbelievable.

1266
01:36:12,142 --> 01:36:13,643
Absolutely right.

1267
01:36:17,314 --> 01:36:21,693
Beers the Destroyer did not destroy them.

1268
01:36:21,902 --> 01:36:26,448
Could it be because of the
marvelous character of Son Goku?

1269
01:36:27,657 --> 01:36:30,118
He keeps making more and more friends...

1270
01:36:30,327 --> 01:36:32,704
...until now, at last, even Beers-sama...

1271
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:34,831
No,

1272
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:38,710
we can't say it was
entirely because of Son Goku.

1273
01:36:38,919 --> 01:36:41,254
It's that whole group--

1274
01:36:41,463 --> 01:36:45,801
no, it may even be because of the whole earth.

1275
01:36:46,009 --> 01:36:50,430
Son Goku, who was supposed
to have been a savage Saiyan,

1276
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:56,144
to say nothing of Vegeta,
changed after coming to earth.

1277
01:36:56,353 --> 01:37:00,357
Humankind aside, it really
is a wonderful planet, isn't it?

1278
01:37:00,565 --> 01:37:05,070
Those people have all sorts of problems,

1279
01:37:05,278 --> 01:37:08,281
but they are brimming with a wondrous charm.

1280
01:37:11,868 --> 01:37:13,954
I guess that was kind of fun.

1281
01:37:15,664 --> 01:37:21,336
I have to admit, his latent
ability is something unfathomable.

1282
01:37:21,545 --> 01:37:26,633
Although, I wouldn't call him an arch-rival.

1283
01:37:26,842 --> 01:37:29,719
Even so, it's been a long
time since I've seen you

1284
01:37:29,928 --> 01:37:34,432
have to use nearly 70 percent
of your power, Beers-sama.

1285
01:37:34,641 --> 01:37:36,309
What was his name again?

1286
01:37:36,518 --> 01:37:39,062
Son Goku.

1287
01:37:39,271 --> 01:37:40,689
Between him and Vegeta,

1288
01:37:40,897 --> 01:37:44,985
they really might become my
arch-rivals before too long, huh?

1289
01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:48,280
You seem pleased by that.

1290
01:37:48,488 --> 01:37:49,990
As are you, aren't you, Whis?

1291
01:37:50,198 --> 01:37:53,493
It can become dull when we both live so long.

1292
01:37:53,702 --> 01:37:57,163
Besides which, I do not sleep.

1293
01:37:57,372 --> 01:38:02,586
Well, I'm a bit tired,
so I think I'll take a three-year nap.

1294
01:38:02,794 --> 01:38:08,925
Three years? That is a
fairly brief snooze, isn't it?

1295
01:38:09,134 --> 01:38:15,056
There appear to be many more
delicious things on earth, after all.

1296
01:38:16,349 --> 01:38:18,560
Sure enough, you did not
feel like destroying earth

1297
01:38:18,768 --> 01:38:22,105
after finding how delicious the food is.

1298
01:38:23,231 --> 01:38:26,276
Oh, I don't know about that.

1299
01:38:26,484 --> 01:38:28,737
Ah, come to think of it...

1300
01:38:28,945 --> 01:38:31,823
I had them pack us something
absolutely delicious, called sushi,

1301
01:38:32,032 --> 01:38:34,784
for us to bring back with us.

1302
01:38:34,993 --> 01:38:39,039
Beers-sama, would you like some?
Or would you rather sleep?

1303
01:38:39,247 --> 01:38:42,083
Ha! I'll have some, of course!

1304
01:38:42,292 --> 01:38:45,629
It looks like you sampled
quite a bit of tasty food

1305
01:38:45,837 --> 01:38:49,633
while I was off fighting, huh, Whis?

1306
01:38:52,135 --> 01:38:56,014
Oh, this is some beautiful food, isn't it?

1307
01:38:56,890 --> 01:39:01,728
You apply a little of this fluid,
called soy sauce, and eat it.

1308
01:39:01,937 --> 01:39:04,314
What is this little green lump here?

1309
01:39:04,522 --> 01:39:08,568
That? Ah, now that you mention it,

1310
01:39:08,777 --> 01:39:13,198
the chef said "Use it as you like,"
and that it was called "wasabi."

1311
01:39:13,406 --> 01:39:17,535
Ah, come to think of it,
I did hear you talking about that.

1312
01:39:17,744 --> 01:39:20,622
While I was fighting.

1313
01:39:20,830 --> 01:39:22,916
Let me go get us something to drink.

1314
01:39:24,250 --> 01:39:25,418
Let's see, here...

1315
01:39:39,891 --> 01:39:40,892
That won't do!

1316
01:39:50,485 --> 01:39:53,822
Yow-w-w... That was mean of you.

1317
01:39:54,030 --> 01:39:58,076
Beers-sama, you <i>do</i> take out your
temper on innocent worlds, after all.

1318
01:39:58,284 --> 01:40:01,788
Hmph. This is all earth's fault.

1319
01:40:01,997 --> 01:40:06,126
All right, let's head back to
earth right now, and destroy it!

1320
01:40:06,334 --> 01:40:10,880
My word, after I said "Use it as you like,"

1321
01:40:11,089 --> 01:40:14,300
you are the one who gulped
it down, right, Beers-sama?

1322
01:40:15,677 --> 01:40:19,723
Well then, let's make it
"if I don't like the taste of sushi,

1323
01:40:19,931 --> 01:40:22,517
it means destruction!" instead.

1324
01:40:45,415 --> 01:40:49,461
Now then, please wake me in another three years.

1325
01:40:49,753 --> 01:40:51,796
It was good, wasn't it?

1326
01:40:54,758 --> 01:40:56,801
Okay, good night.

1327
01:41:09,189 --> 01:41:12,400
Ah, Beers-sama, be sure to
brush before you go to sleep.

1328
01:41:12,609 --> 01:41:17,155
Huh? Yeah... all right, all right...

1329
01:41:19,824 --> 01:41:21,701
Okay, one more time, then!

1330
01:41:21,910 --> 01:41:23,703
Bulma-san, happy---

1331
01:41:23,912 --> 01:41:25,413
...birthday!

1332
01:41:25,622 --> 01:41:26,998
Yeah! 38 years old!

1333
01:41:27,207 --> 01:41:28,458
Shut up!

1334
01:41:30,251 --> 01:41:31,419
Let's drink!

1335
01:41:44,224 --> 01:41:45,809
When you're backed into a corner,

1336
01:41:46,017 --> 01:41:48,478
you may be more fearsome than anything.

1337
01:41:48,686 --> 01:41:52,190
Hey, Kakarrot, next time,
I'm the one who gets to turn God!

1338
01:41:52,398 --> 01:41:54,484
You be sure to cooperate with me.

1339
01:41:54,692 --> 01:41:58,571
Yeah, of course! But when you
overexert yourself to get stronger,

1340
01:41:58,780 --> 01:42:00,907
it leaves you all worn out afterward!

1341
01:42:01,116 --> 01:42:04,744
Oh, come to think of it, Vegeta,
when Bulma got hit, you were all,

1342
01:42:04,953 --> 01:42:09,624
"My Bulma!", got angry, and turned
into an awesome Super Saiyan, huh?

1343
01:42:09,833 --> 01:42:11,709
I felt so loved!

1344
01:42:11,918 --> 01:42:15,338
L-I don't remember saying that!

1345
01:42:15,547 --> 01:42:19,968
J-Just that, at the time,
I definitely think I surpassed you!

1346
01:42:20,176 --> 01:42:21,803
Yeah, you sure did.

1347
01:42:22,595 --> 01:42:24,806
Next time, when we fight
someone who gives us trouble,

1348
01:42:25,014 --> 01:42:27,684
have him slap Bulma for us.

1349
01:42:27,892 --> 01:42:29,519
Hey!

1350
01:42:30,645 --> 01:42:35,441
I thought you weren't here
when Vegeta went off like that.

1351
01:42:35,650 --> 01:42:38,153
You arrived long before that,
using your Instantaneous Movement,

1352
01:42:38,361 --> 01:42:40,446
to see how things played out, didn't you?

1353
01:42:40,655 --> 01:42:42,991
Uh, well...

1354
01:42:43,408 --> 01:42:44,033
<i>Son-kun'.!</i>

1355
01:42:44,242 --> 01:42:48,121
Is that true, you jerk?!
While everyone else was getting beat up?!

1356
01:42:48,329 --> 01:42:50,957
Sorry! Sorry! I was watching
the enemy's movement,

1357
01:42:51,166 --> 01:42:53,459
trying to put together a strategy,

1358
01:42:53,668 --> 01:42:56,462
but well, I didn't come up with anything.

1359
01:42:56,671 --> 01:42:59,424
Bulma! Smack him two or three more times!

1360
01:42:59,632 --> 01:43:00,466
Yes, Sir!

1361
01:43:00,675 --> 01:43:04,470
Whoa, I'm sorry! I know I made a mistake!
