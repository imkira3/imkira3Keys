1
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,500
<i>Scorpion-class pulse warriors.</i>

2
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,200
<i>Kamikaze bombardiers.</i>

3
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,900
<i>Every day,
new Bugs show up on the battlefield.</i>

4
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,900
Watch out! Get down, get down!

5
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,100
<i>So many that some wonder:</i>

6
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,500
GIQ on one.

7
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,200
<i>Don't bet on it, citizen.</i>

8
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,100
<i>Here at Oppenheimer
Proving Grounds...</i>

9
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,600
<i>... federal scientists are cooking up
some nasty top-secret surprises...</i>

10
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,500
<i>... of their own.</i>

11
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,800
<i>But the newest weapon
in the Mobile Infantry's arsenal...</i>

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,700
<i>... is the not-so-secret shovel.</i>

13
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,800
<i>Greater Bug firepower
means trenches.</i>

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,900
<i>And that means digging
here on Roku San...</i>

15
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,700
<i>... this once peaceful farm planet...</i>

16
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,700
<i>... that has become the new frontline
of the Second Bug War.</i>

17
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,400
<i>There you go, trooper.
And put your back into it.</i>

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,100
<i>If you're against the war,
you're against us.</i>

19
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,400
<i>That's what a federal judge
said today...</i>

20
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,300
<i>... when he declared that hanging
is absolutely good enough...</i>

21
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,100
<i>... for anyone who threatens
the morale of the Federation.</i>

22
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,600
- and death. Execute them all.

23
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,500
This is a very simple ruling.
People need to watch what they say.

24
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,400
<i>Admiral Enolo Phid,
division chief, Fleet Intelligence...</i>

25
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,000
<i>... voiced another concern from her
headquarters at Terran Command.</i>

26
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,800
The revival of religious worship here
and in the outer colonies...

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,400
...will not be tolerated
if it leads to sedition...

28
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,100
...or in any other way
destabilizes our war effort.

29
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,100
<i>He's dark, he's handsome,
he's psychic.</i>

30
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,900
<i>Courage, duty, honor</i>

31
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,400
<i>Eagle high above</i>

32
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,000
<i>He's General Omar Anoke,
the sky marshal everyone loves.</i>

33
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,200
<i>And gives us strength
To go and win this war</i>

34
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,800
<i>And at last night's war rally...</i>

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,400
<i>... he thrilled audiences
all across the Federation...</i>

36
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,000
<i>... with a pounding rendition
of his latest hit, "A Good Day to Die."</i>

<i>We fight for what is right</i>

38
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,800
<i>A noble sacrifice</i>

<i>When duty calls, you pay the price</i>

40
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,800
<i>For the Federation
I will give my life</i>

41
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,100
<i>And hey, citizen, now you can
celebrate Sky Marshal Anoke...</i>

42
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,700
<i>... and support our war effort
at the same time.</i>

43
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,600
<i>Because it's always
a good day to buy.</i>

44
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,800
<i>- I will give my life
- Courage, duty, honor</i>

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,800
<i>For the Federation
I will give my life</i>

46
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,200
Incoming!

47
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,200
- Clear out!
- Run!

48
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,400
Move, move, move!

49
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,400
Can you walk, soldier?

50
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,000
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

51
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,300
Give us a hand. Pick up that arm
and find out who it belongs to.

52
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,200
Yes, sir.

53
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,700
Mop up, people.
We got brass up our ass in T-minus-2.

54
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,100
Surprise inspection, sir? Tonight?

55
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,900
The SM can drop in and count
the sheets any time he wants.

56
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,700
The sky marshal's coming here?

57
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,800
Ask him for an autograph, Lieutenant
Manion, and I will have you shot.

58
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,900
No, sir. Of course not, sir.

59
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,400
- Officer on deck.
- Carry on.

60
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,500
Status?

61
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,900
- Archie's testing the fence again, sir.
- Stupid Bugs.

62
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,400
Pesky, not stupid, lieutenant.

63
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,100
Keep it up, Archie.
I like my Bugs fried in the morning.

64
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,400
Boat coming down, colonel.

65
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,700
Look sharp, troopers.

66
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,200
Sir, the sky marshal is the
Federation's top-secret top secret.

67
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,900
So how'd you know
he was coming?

68
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,200
Anoke's chief of staff
used to polish my brass.

69
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,700
You know General Hauzer?

70
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,100
Dix Hauzer was a dope lieutenant
just like you once upon a time.

71
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,100
Made general in two years.
Some dope.

72
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,100
Only took me eight years
to make colonel.

73
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,400
Officer on deck.

74
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,700
- John Rico.
- Good to see you, Dix.

75
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,900
- How's it going?
- Good.

76
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,000
I have to introduce you to someone.
I think I'm in love.

77
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,600
Yeah? Who'd have you?

78
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,400
Here he comes, everybody.
Let's go, come on.

79
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,100
Officer on deck.

80
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,100
Sorry to drop in unannounced,
colonel.

81
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,900
And yet I sense you expect my visit.

82
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:55,100
Get in tight on this, sergeant.
Johnny Rico, our hero of Planet P.

83
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,400
I just did my part, sir.

84
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,200
Oh, no.
Heroes inspire courage, sacrifice.

85
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,900
- Sacrifice?
- Yes.

86
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,300
By asking us
to be better than what we are.

87
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,100
Tell me about Roku San, colonel.

88
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,900
Will these farmers fight?

89
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,200
They need us,
but they don't like us, sir.

90
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,200
Hearts are more fickle than minds.

91
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,300
Johnny Rico.

92
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,100
Lola Beck?

93
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,100
What are you doing here?

94
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,300
I fly the SM.

95
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,800
He gets the best.

96
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,800
Well, you know me, Johnny.

97
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,100
Yes, I know you.

98
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,900
Captain Beck is the person
I was talking about earlier.

99
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,100
You?

100
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,300
And Lola?

101
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,600
What's the joke?

102
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,400
Captain Beck,
you should have informed me...

103
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,800
...of your relationship
with Colonel Rico.

104
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,700
You know what I do out of uniform
is off the clock, general.

105
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,800
You three obviously
have much to discuss.

106
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,600
Buy them both
a drink on me, colonel.

107
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,000
Yes, sir.

108
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,300
- Lieutenant Manion, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

109
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,400
- Care to give me the post tour?
- Me?

110
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,300
I have all your songs, sir.

111
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,200
- Carry on, lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

112
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,000
Follow me, sir.

113
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,200
Come on, kids. We got orders.

114
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,400
You boys are the biggest girls
I've ever known.

115
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,200
What do you think of them?

116
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,700
Bugs? I hate them, sir.

117
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Well, no one likes
what they can't understand.

118
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,200
But just look at the imagination.

119
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,800
The sheer virtuosity
of their creation.

120
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,900
I hate to bother you, sir, but
could you please sign my helmet?

121
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,100
Of course, trooper.

122
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,400
- Thank you, sir.
- Anytime, son.

123
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,900
All I know is...

124
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,600
...there sure are a lot more of them
at the wire today, sir.

125
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,000
A lot more.

126
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,300
Well, maybe they heard
I was going to sing.

127
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,800
- Officer on deck.
- Look sharp.

128
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,900
At ease.

129
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,600
Gentlemen.

130
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,900
You got me confused
with someone who isn't a farmer.

131
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,600
- How do I get me a hat like that?
- Join up, do your part.

132
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,600
Farmers.

133
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,700
- I'd like to ask you something.
- Sorry, chief.

134
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,700
Already married.

135
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,500
Buy them a drink on me, will you?
And bring us a bottle.

136
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,000
Hose your cage, Harlan.

137
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,200
These are the kind of people
who will lose this war for us.

138
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,200
Why is it no one in the outer colonies
wants to fight?

139
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,900
Roku San used to be a nice place.

140
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,800
Now it's war, and they blame us.

141
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,500
Archie's cooking tonight.

142
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,200
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

143
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,200
- What are they thinking?
- Archie don't think.

144
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,500
It's a good day to fry.

145
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,900
- Ten-hut.
- At ease, troopers.

146
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,800
Fascinating.

147
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,900
They seem so excited tonight.

148
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,900
You ought to hear them, sir.
They're howling out there.

149
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,100
Well, put them on the line, soldier.

150
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,000
What does it mean, sir?

151
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,900
It means we're being tested,
lieutenant.

152
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,700
Our loyalty, our intelligence...

153
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,900
...our imagination.

154
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,300
Excuse me, sir.
My brother really loves you.

155
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,200
- Of course. What's his name?
- Kevin.

156
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,500
- I'm sure he'll make a fine recruit.
- Thank you.

157
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,600
- May I, sir?
- Of course you can, trooper.

158
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,500
<i>Ask him for an autograph, Lieutenant
Manion, and I will have you shot.</i>

159
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,500
Hey, where'd he go?

160
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,400
To us.

161
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,000
To us.

162
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,400
To John, hero of Planet P.

163
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,400
Lola, two ships
shot out from under you.

164
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,100
I fly a goddamn desk.

165
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,700
The battles I fight are with numbers.
That's what I do.

166
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,000
That's what I know.

167
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,700
And that's why I know...

168
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,800
...that if everyone in here
doesn't step up, we're sunk.

169
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,600
- To the Federation.
- The Federation.

170
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,400
"To the Federation."

171
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,000
So, Dix.

172
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,800
Rico and I met...

173
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,500
...when Johnny was a big war hero
and I was still a six.

174
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,400
Bond tour. Ten planets, eight days.

175
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,300
Do you remember Turtle Bay?

176
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,200
So, Dix, how do you know Johnny?

177
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,000
Well, he used to be my boss
at TCOM.

178
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,400
Standard rotation.
Worst year of my life.

179
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,100
Dix saved my ass every day.

180
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Hey, it's hanging time.

181
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,000
<i>Appeals are exhausted.
Their families have said goodbye.</i>

182
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,700
<i>All that remains is payment
for their crimes against you, citizen.</i>

183
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,800
<i>The senior executive executioner
is taking his time.</i>

184
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,800
<i>Sending a message, perhaps.</i>

185
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,800
<i>One for all of us to contemplate
this evening.</i>

186
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,100
<i>That our ideas,
no matter how pleasing...</i>

187
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,900
<i>... are dangerous.</i>

188
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,200
<i>That there are actions
and consequences.</i>

189
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,600
<i>That no one really counts
very much...</i>

190
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,800
<i>... unless we are part
of something bigger.</i>

191
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,900
<i>There it is, justice.</i>

192
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,800
You'll pay.
As God is my witness, you'll pay.

193
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,900
- Back off.
- Hold on, hold on, wait, wait.

194
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,600
Hey, fuck off, feddy.

195
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,500
You guys fail to understand
a very clear lesson here.

196
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,100
You got something to learn me?

197
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,300
- Come on, Dix, let's get out of here.
- Colonel Rico, if you please.

198
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,700
Yes, sir.

199
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,000
MPs, now. I want them arrested.
Everyone. That's an order.

200
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,200
Yes, sir. Sergeant.

201
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,700
You heard the general.

202
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,500
My friends,
you're not bigger than the Federation.

203
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,200
Watch what you say
and do what you're told.

204
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,000
- Or you'll have us hung, is that it?
- It's up to you.

205
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,200
Come on, Dix.
Let's get Lola out of here.

206
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,600
I don't work for you anymore, John.
Stand down.

207
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:17,100
Did you hear that, everybody?
Stand down. That's an order.

208
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,100
From now on, I take my own lumps.

209
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,600
I got this.

210
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,200
Now you're in violation of Article 5.

211
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,100
Article 8.

212
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,900
- Had enough?
- Stand down, Rico.

213
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,800
Stand down.

214
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,900
That's Article 11.

215
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,000
That's 11.

216
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,900
Which makes you subject to...

217
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,100
- Special Order 86.
- Look out!

218
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,200
Colonel Rico, you're out of order.

219
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,000
Begging the general's pardon, sir.

220
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,400
I was trying to keep an old friend
from making an ass of himself.

221
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,800
Friendship means nothing
next to duty, colonel.

222
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,300
And you have forgotten yours.

223
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,500
I thought we were here
to kill Bugs, sir.

224
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,100
Not farmers.

225
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,600
Arrest the farmers. Sedition.

226
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,400
- And Colonel Rico too.
- All right, on your feet, asshole.

227
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,800
- Failure to obey a superior officer.
- Hey, Dix, stop it.

228
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,700
Johnny's right.

229
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,900
Move it!

230
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,800
Captain Beck.

231
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,200
Return to your boat.

232
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,000
Sergeant, you have your orders.

233
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,700
Colonel, please come with me.

234
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,900
<i>Electrical system malfunction.</i>

235
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,300
Oh, no.

236
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,700
Here they come,
they're on the wall.

237
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,300
<i>- Rico.
- It's all down. Everything.</i>

238
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,200
<i>The fence is down, sir.</i>

239
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,400
- The fence?
- How could that have happened?

240
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,100
<i>Fuck, here they come.</i>

241
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,200
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

242
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,000
<i>We need reinforcements.</i>

243
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,800
<i>We need reinforcements now, sir!</i>

244
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,100
- I'm on my way.
- Hold on. You are under arrest.

245
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,800
- Is that your final word?
- No, that's an order.

246
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,300
I'll see you at my court-martial.

247
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,900
- Nice seeing you, Lola.
- Yeah.

248
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,500
Make a hole, coming through.

249
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,100
Heads up, colonel.

250
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,500
Keep it moving. Keep it moving.

251
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,100
Come on, you apes.
You wanna live forever?

252
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,400
Move it. Come on.

253
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,600
Keep it moving.

254
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,200
Fall back.

255
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,500
Defensive positions. Incoming.

256
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,800
Let's go.

257
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,500
Go. Go.

258
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,500
Out of ammo, man. Out of ammo.

259
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,300
No!

260
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:36,200
- Bugs!
- Two lines! Front and back!

261
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Fire!

262
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,500
Grenades!

263
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,900
Fire!

264
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,800
Forward!

265
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,300
Colonel Rico, sir.

266
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,700
- Situation, lieutenant.
- Totally ominously fucked up, sir.

267
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,700
And I lost the sky marshal too, sir.

268
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,900
Good. We'll all hang together.

269
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:46,600
You know what to do.
Get in there and kill them all!

270
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,000
- Where's forward command?
- It's Bugs.

271
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,100
It's Bugs.
Bugs everywhere you go, sir.

272
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,400
Sir, what are you doing here?

273
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,800
Are you wounded? We have
to get you to the lander right now.

274
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,700
I'm fine.

275
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,300
Marines, gather around. We must get
the sky marshal to safety right now.

276
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,900
Yes, sir. Formation.
This way, general.

277
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,300
Archie.

278
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,500
Clear.

279
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,000
Keep moving.

280
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,800
Archie. Get that paddock open.

281
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,800
This is General Hauzer.
Open this door.

282
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,400
Open the door.

283
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,700
Sir.

284
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,300
Get this door closed!

285
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,900
Dr. Wiggs, over here.
Dr. Wiggs, we need you.

286
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,500
Get him inside.

287
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:29,100
- Corpsman, see to Sergeant Rye.
- Yes, sir.

288
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,400
Fucking Bugs. I hate them!

289
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,500
Dr. Wiggs. Front and center.

290
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,500
- What's wrong with him?
- Careful.

291
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,300
He's in shock. Are you all right, sir?

292
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,700
Are you all right, sir?

293
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,000
Sir?

294
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,400
- I will be.
- Oh, good.

295
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,800
Here we go. Careful.

296
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,900
Captain Beck, when do we leave?

297
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,700
How about T-minus-now, sir?

298
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,500
Sir, requesting permission
to remain on Roku San, sir.

299
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,900
- Trying to be a hero, Dix?
- Somebody's gotta stay and fight.

300
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,600
Sir.

301
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,800
Colonel Rico is in command.

302
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,200
I was forced to relieve Colonel Rico.

303
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,600
He's under arrest
for acts of insubordination.

304
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,100
Serious charges.
I'm sorry for your friend.

305
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,600
Perhaps your destiny
does lay here after all, Dix.

306
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,200
Go find it.

307
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,700
And good luck, soldier.

308
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,100
Wait.

309
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,600
Just think about this for a second.

310
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,400
Because you're making a decision
for the both of us right now.

311
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,200
I know.

312
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,800
Dix, I love you.

313
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,500
I love you.

314
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,900
Blast off, Fleet.

315
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,600
<i>Attention, all units.</i>

316
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,200
This is General Hauzer.

317
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,400
<i>I am assuming command
effective immediately.</i>

318
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,600
Go to the bunker!

319
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,700
<i>Repeat, I'm assuming command.
All unit commanders report.</i>

320
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,400
<i>I want location and status. Now.</i>

321
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,900
We lost G Trench, sir.

322
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,400
Put that in a memo to
General Hauzer, will you, lieutenant?

323
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,800
Yes, sir.

324
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,300
This is Hauzer to all units.
I say again, I'm assuming command.

325
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,800
They're pulling back, sir.

326
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,700
- Get down!
- Hit the deck!

327
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,600
Clear the deck.

328
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,300
Skinner, Hightower, cover that hole.

329
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,500
Prepare for attack!

330
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,500
Bombardier!

331
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,800
Scorp! It's a scorp!

332
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,700
Scorpion.

333
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,300
Scorpion! Oh, fuck! Scorpion!

334
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,600
Fire, fire, fire!

335
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,300
Grenades!

336
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,100
Take us home, Captain Beck.

337
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,100
Warp in five, number one.

338
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,400
<i>Yes, ma'am.
What about General Hauzer, ma'am?</i>

339
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,600
He wants combat.
Take us out on my mark.

340
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,300
Five, four, three, two, one.

341
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,200
The guy says, "Man,
then we can all get some sleep."

342
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,800
Fucking Archie.
Can't believe I got bitten.

343
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,800
Yeah, he got you.

344
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,800
Officer on deck.

345
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,900
At ease.

346
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,500
Nice work out there, sergeant.

347
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,700
Thank you, ma'am. SM all okay?

348
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,300
Thanks to you boys.

349
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,400
What do we say, marines?

350
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,900
- Yeah.
- Carry on.

351
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,700
Oh, boy.

352
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,300
Chief Brittles, are we shipshape?

353
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,200
You'd be the first to know, captain.

354
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,700
Just saying hi, Bull.

355
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,400
Excuse me, ma'am.

356
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,400
If that's the SM's dinner,
after you, Holly.

357
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,200
Thank you, ma'am.

358
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,700
What's cooking, Jingo?

359
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,500
You know,
the same old shit on a shingle.

360
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,600
- Drink, captain?
- On duty, doc.

361
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,300
Me too.

362
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,300
Captain Beck.
Give a listen, will you?

363
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:47,200
Today we have suffered grave defeat
at Roku San.

364
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:53,300
But I am confident that there exists
balance in the cosmos and...

365
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,800
Excuse me, sir.

366
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:03,200
I am certain that there exists balance
in the cosmos.

367
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,600
And where there is defeat,
we will make victory.

368
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,500
What do you think?

369
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,200
I have to address
the council tomorrow.

370
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,900
Well, sir, everybody loves victory.

371
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,600
If you'll excuse me,
I'll be getting back to the cockpit.

372
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,600
Look, look, can't they manage
without you just for once?

373
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,800
Let's stay and talk.

374
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,600
Certainly, sir, I'd be happy to.

375
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,400
Hold on.

376
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,700
We're falling out of warp.

377
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,600
Sir, for your own protection...

378
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,400
...l'm gonna need to get you
to the marine lander.

379
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,300
Holly, stay with us.

380
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,600
- What just hit us?
- I think we just hit each other.

381
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,300
Come on, Holly, let's move.

382
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,400
- Marines, report to the rescue deck.
- I read you, Captain Beck.

383
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,100
And we are on our way.

384
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,200
Let's go.

385
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,400
Come on.

386
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,700
Marines. Right here, brothers.

387
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,200
Let's go.

388
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,200
Was that a reactor, chief?

389
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,000
Secondary. Number one
will turn us into daylight.

390
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,200
I'm okay. I'm okay.

391
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,700
- Abandon ship, chief.
- Yes, ma'am.

392
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,600
Sergeant Rye,
the SM goes with you.

393
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,900
Yes, ma'am. Come with us now, sir.

394
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,600
Captain Beck, I would prefer
that you stay at my side.

395
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,400
Yes, sir. Crew chief,
get everyone else to the rescue pod.

396
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,100
You got it.

397
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,100
- We got a little problem in the galley.
- Jingo, jeez.

398
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,100
Dumb ass.

399
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,500
- You okay?
- Yeah.

400
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,800
Go get the SM, Chick.

401
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Sir, this way.

402
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,400
No! Damn it!

403
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,000
- Marines, get to your lander.
- I will see you on the ground.

404
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,800
Okay, people, let's move.
To the rescue pod, now.

405
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,700
- Are we crashing?
- No, we're getting into the rescue pod.

406
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,500
<i>The Roku San line,
key to the Federation's defense...</i>

407
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,900
<i>... knows defeat in one night.</i>

408
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,800
<i>How many dead? No man can say.</i>

409
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,500
<i>Experts agree on one thing only:</i>

410
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,200
<i>Blame falls squarely
on Colonel John Rico.</i>

411
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,800
<i>Once heralded
as the hero of Planet P.</i>

412
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
<i>Now disgraced
and awaiting court-martial...</i>

413
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,100
<i>... from his cell at the Alamo Bay
Federal Detention Facility.</i>

414
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:37,200
<i>Another day, another peace rally
in the outer colonies.</i>

415
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,700
<i>The Federation
has taken advantage.</i>

416
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:43,100
<i>But this time it's different,
because of Elmo Goniff.</i>

417
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,500
Hey, I'm a citizen.

418
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,600
<i>Decorated veteran turned pacifist...</i>

419
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,400
<i>... and now the leader
of a growing coalition of citizens...</i>

420
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,900
<i>... who question the Federation's
administration...</i>

421
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,300
<i>... of the Arachnid conflict.</i>

422
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:57,500
- and counting. Why?
I found my answers in faith.

423
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,000
<i>And I have faith in God, not people.</i>

424
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:04,000
<i>Peace at any price is a human right.</i>

425
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,100
<i>And there are other costs too.</i>

426
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,900
<i>Defeat at Roku San
has fueled the anti-war movement...</i>

427
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:12,100
<i>... resulting in the deaths
of 144 outer-colony students...</i>

428
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,100
<i>... and religious protesters.</i>

429
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,300
<i>We break net now to take you live
to Terran Command...</i>

430
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,500
<i>... where Sky Marshal Omar Anoke
will address the Federation...</i>

431
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,300
<i>... on the Roku San crisis.</i>

432
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:32,600
<i>My fellow citizens, I come
to you today with a heavy heart.</i>

433
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,500
<i>Within the past 12 hours...</i>

434
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:39,900
<i>... we have suffered
ignominious defeat at Roku San.</i>

435
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,700
<i>Incompetence at the highest levels
of command...</i>

436
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:46,500
...and betrayal...

437
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:50,900
...by those who would protest,
question...

438
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:54,400
...and commit acts
of civil disobedience.

439
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:59,600
I assure you that those responsible
for the catastrophe at Roku San...

440
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:04,200
...and all crimes against
the Federation, large and small...

441
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,000
...will be punished.

442
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,500
Ours is a war of human destiny...

443
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:18,200
...that will end only in total victory.

444
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,900
And we're out.

445
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,800
Okay, let's wrap it up. Good.

446
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,200
So?

447
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
What's the matter, general?
You don't look very happy with me.

448
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,500
We all understand
the need to maintain stability...

449
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,300
...until we locate the sky marshal.

450
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,700
I'm surprised to see you.

451
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:49,000
I thought you'd take some time
to recover from your ordeal.

452
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,900
The sky marshal would want me
in the office, admiral.

453
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,200
Naturally.

454
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,800
Excuse me, sir.

455
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,200
Sorry, sir.

456
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,100
- Lieutenant?
- Lamb.

457
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,200
I know no one's supposed
to talk about it...

458
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,400
...but I'm sorry
about the sky marshal, sir.

459
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:05,500
That's classified, lieutenant.
Phid will have your head in a noose.

460
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,600
But thanks.

461
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,400
Something else?

462
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,700
A distress call
came out of the AQZ yesterday.

463
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,100
And how are you aware of this
and I'm not?

464
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,900
The transmission came through
on my watch, sir.

465
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,800
<i>Sierra Mike Uniform to Fleet Rescue.
Come in, Fleet.</i>

466
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,300
<i>Sierra Mike Uniform,
this is Fleet Rescue, over.</i>

467
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,900
<i>Requesting priority pickup
for sky marshal plus five.</i>

468
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,700
What happened
when you kicked it upstairs?

469
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:52,300
We were instructed to ignore it, sir,
and all future transmissions.

470
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,300
And I'm supposed to
keep my mouth shut.

471
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,100
That why you're here, lieutenant?

472
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:02,300
They're out there all alone
and no one's doing anything about it.

473
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,300
Sir.

474
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,900
You were never here, lieutenant.

475
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,300
No, sir. Never.

476
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:32,200
<i>Sierra Mike Uniform to Fleet Rescue.
Come in, Fleet.</i>

477
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,300
Sierra Mike Uniform to Fleet Rescue.

478
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,800
Fleet Rescue, come in.

479
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,300
They're gonna come and get us,
right, captain?

480
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,400
I mean, like,
how long till they get here?

481
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,700
Here you go, doc.

482
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:51,700
I say again,
Sierra Mike Uniform to Fleet Rescue.

483
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,700
Come in, Fleet.

484
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,400
Is anyone out there?

485
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,400
I don't think we're getting through.
Jingo, get out of there.

486
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,900
Why? I like it in here. Okay.

487
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,100
The solar cells need recharging.

488
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,700
Don't have time
for a day at the beach.

489
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,700
Bugs!

490
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,400
One or 1000?

491
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,500
Who's to say
there's not an army out there?

492
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:37,000
- Oh, God.
- I didn't see anything.

493
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,100
Probably a scout.

494
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,400
We need to get off this beach
pronto, people.

495
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,600
Leave the rescue pod?

496
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,400
You want your back to the water
when these Bugs show up?

497
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,100
Be my guest, doc.

498
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,400
Our father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

499
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,400
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done...

500
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,600
Give it a break.

501
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,000
Easy now, captain.

502
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,200
You ain't sure,
and you're scaring us all to death.

503
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,800
On Earth as it is in heaven.

504
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,100
Give us this day our daily bread
and del...

505
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,000
You are really getting on my nerves.

506
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,700
You've got no cause to do that.

507
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,400
Get your hand off me, crew chief.

508
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,600
You're hurting him.

509
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,400
Everyone's got a right
to think what they want.

510
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,200
Sure, as long as they keep it
to themselves.

511
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,400
Saddle up. We're moving out.

512
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,800
Wait a second. When Fleet Rescue
comes looking for us...

513
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,400
...this is the first place
they're gonna come, right?

514
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,500
I expect they would, Bull.

515
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,100
Then we should stay right here.

516
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,300
And if the Bugs do attack,
we just fall right back to the pod.

517
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:52,900
Smart thinking, Bull.

518
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,000
You ever been in a swarm,
big man?

519
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,600
Swarm? Oh, my God, no.

520
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,100
They'll tear this pod apart
like a paper bag.

521
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,300
Oh, God, save us.

522
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,900
Now, gear up, we're moving out.
And that's an order.

523
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,700
Our father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

524
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:16,300
- Can the God talk.
- You're wrong, Captain Beck.

525
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,000
God is everywhere, surrounding us.

526
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,200
Excuse me, sir?

527
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,200
All of us search for God
in our own way...

528
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,700
...whether we know it or not.

529
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,100
Do you really believe that, sir?

530
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,400
Yes, Holly, I do.

531
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:37,000
I had no idea
that you were one of us.

532
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,200
All right. Well, all of you guys
can go look for God.

533
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,300
I'm heading
for the Fleet marine lander.

534
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,400
They've got weapons,
maybe even a com that works.

535
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,500
And it's only
about a hundred klicks away.

536
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,800
Only a hundred klicks away.

537
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,300
We ain't got rations for that.

538
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:56,300
You're fat. You won't need any.
Let's move, people.

539
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,400
<i>Colonel John Rico,
for incompetence of command...</i>

540
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,300
<i>... assault on a superior officer,
and willful negligence...</i>

541
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:28,200
<i>... resulting in the deaths of several
soldiers under your command...</i>

542
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,000
<i>... you are sentenced to hang
by the neck until you are dead.</i>

543
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,100
Do you have anything to say
before the sentence is carried out?

544
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,900
Get on with it, will you?

545
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,300
I'll see you in hell.

546
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,400
What the hell is this?

547
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,200
Your lucky day.

548
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,000
Intelligence. Classified.

549
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:35,300
You talk, and next time
it's your neck in the noose.

550
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,400
Let's go, hero.

551
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,400
You gonna hang me yourself, Dix?

552
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,700
Maybe I got some better things
for you to do.

553
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:50,300
You come here a lot,
don't you, Dix?

554
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,000
Didn't know you were interested
in political prisoners.

555
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,400
Not me.
I come with the sky marshal.

556
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,400
- Interrogations.
- Anoke likes the personal touch, eh?

557
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:01,500
Not like you think.
Not human prisoners.

558
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:04,600
That first Brain, the one
you captured on P, we keep it here.

559
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:08,400
- It's still alive?
- Alive and a lot bigger.

560
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,800
No one really knows
how long they live.

561
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
What's it good for?

562
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,000
Anoke was fascinated by that thing.

563
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:19,300
Why's my neck suddenly worth more
than a piece of rope?

564
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,300
It's about the future
of the Federation, Johnny.

565
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:25,300
- And Lola.
- What's that got to do with me?

566
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,800
- You're the only one I can trust.
- Why's that, buddy?

567
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,000
Because everyone thinks
you're dead.

568
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,100
- Captain?
- I see them, Jingo.

569
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:22,800
I count 16.

570
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,200
Bugs? Where?

571
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,900
- Oh, no.
- Why did they stop?

572
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,400
Let's move.

573
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,600
- Bull.
- What?

574
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,500
- You with me.
- You got it.

575
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:48,900
They're herding us.

576
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,500
Why? They could have us easy.

577
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:56,000
Perhaps we find ourselves
under the grace of a higher power.

578
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,000
You really think so, sir?

579
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:01,000
I know it in my heart, Holly.

580
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,400
Do you really think we're protected
by some higher power?

581
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,300
Singing can't hurt.

582
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:27,500
Lifts the spirit and helps
pass the time, don't you think?

583
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,000
I think we're not dead
and we should be.

584
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,100
Yeah.

585
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:12,700
<i>It's big. It's deadly.</i>

586
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:17,200
<i>And everyone's got an opinion
about the new Q-bomb.</i>

587
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,500
<i>Politicians and citizens alike
worry about the morality of a bomb...</i>

588
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:23,800
<i>... rumored to be so powerful
it can crack a planet.</i>

589
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:26,600
<i>Creation of a weapon
that can destroy the very planet...</i>

590
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:31,000
<i>... on which I now stand is nothing
if not a dangerous precedent...</i>

591
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,200
<i>... for the entire human race.</i>

592
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,700
<i>What people fail to grasp...</i>

593
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:37,100
<i>... is how many planets
there are in the universe.</i>

594
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:40,400
<i>And that the universe itself
often destroys other planets.</i>

595
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:44,000
<i>The Federation can't decide which
planet lives and which planet dies.</i>

596
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:49,000
<i>The Lord giveth
and the Lord taketh away.</i>

597
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:53,200
<i>You think those dirty Bugs wouldn't
use a Q-bomb if they had one?</i>

598
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,800
<i>But aren't we supposed to be
better than the Bugs?</i>

599
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,400
<i>You said it, Mom.
That's controversy with a Q.</i>

600
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,900
Yesterday I dropped troopers
into a combat zone.

601
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:11,100
Today I'm flying
to the outer colonies.

602
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:12,400
I'm Fleet.

603
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,200
- I'm Fleet too.
- We're Fleet too.

604
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:19,800
Me? Really?

605
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,500
<i>If you have strong math skills,
high reflex index...</i>

606
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:25,200
<i>... and an HED of 8. 1 or better,
we need you now.</i>

607
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:26,500
<i>Sixteen? No problem.</i>

608
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,100
<i>Start training today
for your future, citizen.</i>

609
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,800
People say boys don't give good HED.
But I do.

610
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,700
<i>When you go Fleet,
there's no telling where you'll end up.</i>

611
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,200
You know, when I was young...

612
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,900
...I dreamed
that one day I'd fly a starship...

613
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:42,300
...or even visit Sanctuary.

614
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,900
Fleet has taken me to the top.

615
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:48,300
How high you fly is up to you
when you go Fleet.

616
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,900
So why not do your part
and sign up today?

617
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,000
See you in the cockpit.

618
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,100
<i>Would you like to know more?</i>

619
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,600
Well, John.

620
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:16,000
Your first time at Sanctuary.

621
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,300
- So this is the big wow.
- This is it.

622
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,200
If the Bugs find this place,
they'll knock out the Fleet.

623
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:33,600
No Fleet, you lose the outer colonies.
Mobile Infantry couldn't hold them.

624
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:36,300
There goes the neighborhood.

625
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,500
- Next stop, Earth.
- Yeah.

626
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,800
Guess that makes Sanctuary
the biggest secret of the war.

627
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,200
Not even the sky marshal
knows where it is.

628
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:49,600
Only a handful of active-duty pilots
are entrusted with that information.

629
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,300
Don't tell me.

630
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:53,000
Lola's one of them.

631
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:59,000
Yup, and if we don't find her,
we're sunk.

632
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,900
I'm sending you
to the Arachnid Quarantine Zone...

633
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:12,800
...as soon as you saddle up.

634
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,000
What do we know about this planet?

635
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,500
OM-1? Nothing.

636
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:18,400
We don't even have
its exact position.

637
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,800
What about the rescue call?
Wasn't there a beacon?

638
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,400
Enolo Phid
doesn't want Anoke rescued.

639
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:27,500
- I don't get it.
- Phid wants to be Anoke.

640
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:30,300
I'm glad all I do is fight Bugs.

641
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,600
So I'm gonna get the coordinates
and you go in.

642
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,100
Roger that.

643
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:36,400
But what makes you so sure
they're still alive?

644
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,100
Well, Lola's hard to kill.

645
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,400
If this mission is off the books...

646
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:45,200
...how are you gonna get me
a regiment to invade the AQZ?

647
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:48,800
A regiment? Not even close.

648
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,400
- So how many troopers do I get?
- Seven.

649
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:54,400
- What?
- That's including you.

650
00:50:56,100 --> 00:51:00,200
You're sending me into
the Bug house with a rifle squad?

651
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:04,000
Why didn't you just
let them hang me, Dix?

652
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,600
Maybe I should have.

653
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:11,700
Don't worry,
I'm assembling your team now.

654
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:16,700
It's my funeral. My pick of the team.

655
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:20,100
Any way you want it.

656
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:33,900
They aren't much to look at,
are they?

657
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:37,900
Well, we didn't build them
to do pretty things.

658
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,100
Hey, doc.

659
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:56,300
- When did he get the religion?
- I wouldn't call it religion per se.

660
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:59,500
- He's spiritual.
- That's different.

661
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,900
Yeah, two months ago, I received
a call in the middle of the night.

662
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:05,100
I hadn't seen him for a week.

663
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:08,800
He told me he'd been in the desert
and that he'd been tested.

664
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
He wasn't himself.

665
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,600
Go on.

666
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,200
Well, every man, even great men...

667
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:19,000
...experience moments of doubt
when they're tired and afraid.

668
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,700
Afraid of what?

669
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:23,900
He told me that this was a war
that would never end.

670
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,400
That if we stay this course...

671
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:29,900
...the Bugs will and must
destroy the human race.

672
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:32,500
So he's lost his nut.

673
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,900
Extraordinary, 10 out of 10.

674
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:38,500
He had an episode.
I gave him a sedative.

675
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:41,500
The next day he told me not to worry,
that he'd talked to God.

676
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:47,300
Doc, if I told you I was talking to God,
would you clear me for flight?

677
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,200
I...

678
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:52,500
Is the SM unfit for command?

679
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,100
I find this a very
uncomfortable conversation, captain.

680
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,300
If I need to assume command,
I'm gonna need your help...

681
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,400
...because the others
won't understand.

682
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,500
We could both hang.

683
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,300
Is your loyalty to the SM
or the Federation?

684
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,700
Don't blame the cook, folks.

685
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:34,300
The SM goes first.

686
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,400
Just water. Bull, you have mine.

687
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:37,600
Are you sure, sir?

688
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:40,200
Well, I'm sure
we'll need your strength.

689
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,300
Thank you, sir.

690
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:48,100
If you don't mind, can we maybe
say a prayer before we eat?

691
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,800
Of course.

692
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,100
Dr. Wiggs?

693
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,700
Captain Beck, how about you?

694
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:02,800
I'll be checking the perimeter, sir.

695
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:10,000
We thank thee, Lord,
for the meal we're about to receive.

696
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:13,500
Please bless us and keep us.

697
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:17,700
Protect us from all evil
and guide us...

698
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:20,000
...that we may know the way to you.

699
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,200
Amen.

700
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,900
- Amen.
- Amen.

701
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,200
Can I ask you a question, sir?

702
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,600
Of course, Bull.

703
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:42,300
They are gonna come looking for us,
won't they, sir?

704
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:43,900
Because of you.

705
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,500
We are on a mission
of the greatest importance, Bull.

706
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:50,100
Even if we do not now
understand our purpose.

707
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:54,000
Yes, sir.
But we are gonna be rescued.

708
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,300
I mean, you do know that,
don't you?

709
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,400
Because you're psychic.

710
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:05,400
I know how people around me feel,
and sometimes I can speak to them...

711
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,100
...but no one can predict the future,
Bull.

712
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:31,300
I have a question for you.

713
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,500
For all of you.

714
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,000
Do you have faith?

715
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:42,600
I believe.

716
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:45,800
I know you do, Holly.
Your faith is clear and serene.

717
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,300
I wanna believe too, sir.

718
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:53,600
I really do.

719
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:57,200
Well, that's the start of it, Bull.

720
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:03,300
Dr. Wiggs, how about you?

721
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:09,000
I believe in you, sir.

722
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:14,000
Well, careful now, Dr. Wiggs.

723
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,100
See, I'm only a man.

724
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,300
Earthquake.

725
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,700
Incoming!

726
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,500
Incoming!

727
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,500
Help me! Bull!

728
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:25,200
- Jingo, Jingo.
- Hold on.

729
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,000
Hold on, Jingo.

730
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,200
Come on, come on!

731
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:44,700
Jesus.

732
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:56,300
Where's Wiggs?

733
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,000
Dr. Wiggs?

734
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,100
Dr. Wiggs?

735
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:02,600
Wiggs?

736
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,400
Doc?

737
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:09,700
Wiggs?

738
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:11,900
Doc?

739
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:14,000
Good to see you again, troopers.

740
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,700
You are now all part
of a classified mission.

741
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:20,300
Talk about it and they will hang you.
Get me?

742
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,600
We get you, sir.

743
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,700
What exactly
is the Marauder program, sir?

744
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:30,900
- I'm not currently at liberty to say.
- Sir, is the mission survivable, sir?

745
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,600
We'll find out, trooper.

746
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:37,100
You know what I think, sir?

747
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:43,200
- What's that, sergeant?
- I think it's a good day to die, sir.

748
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:46,500
Outstanding.
Glad you feel that way.

749
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:50,500
Because today, we're headed out
for the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.

750
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:55,000
- Saddle up, troopers.
- Sir, yes, sir.

751
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,800
Hauzer for Lamb.

752
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:09,500
<i>I'm sorry, general,
Lieutenant Lamb's been transferred.</i>

753
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:10,600
Where?

754
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,200
<i>I'm sorry, sir, I can't tell you that.</i>

755
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:31,900
What?

756
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:39,600
- Dix, come in.
- You are going to hang Lamb?

757
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,700
Little redhead, sad eyes,
big mouth?

758
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:45,200
Why?

759
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,600
That is what happens
to traitors, Dix.

760
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:50,300
Seems like you know
all about traitors, admiral.

761
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:53,000
Maybe I'm looking at one right now.

762
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:55,500
So you're gonna hang me too?

763
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:57,900
Well, a lot of that
going around these days.

764
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,300
What happens to you
when the council finds out...

765
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,700
...you suppressed
the sky marshal's rescue call?

766
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:05,200
And exactly who would tell them
such a thing?

767
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:12,300
You give me the coordinates
for Planet OM-1, resign...

768
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,600
...and I keep my mouth shut.

769
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,300
I'm sorry, Dix.

770
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:20,000
But very shortly,
Omar Anoke will be dead...

771
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,200
...and honored as a hero
of the Federation...

772
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,800
...and I will be
the next sky marshal.

773
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,500
Over my dead body.

774
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,900
That your last request, general?

775
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:51,100
<i>Federal Council members
were called together today...</i>

776
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:53,500
<i>... by Sky Marshal Anoke
for his weekly report.</i>

777
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:55,700
How are you doing, sir?
Good to see you.

778
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:59,900
<i>Then... disaster.</i>

779
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:04,500
<i>A bomb carried by a member of
the Goniff Peace Coalition explodes.</i>

780
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:06,200
<i>Among the missing:</i>

781
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:10,700
<i>Sky Marshal Anoke and
his loyal aide, General Dix Hauzer.</i>

782
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:15,900
Today, each and every one of us...

783
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:18,900
...has been attacked by a man...

784
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,700
...who would demand peace
at all costs.

785
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:25,400
A man who calls himself a citizen.

786
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:28,800
A man who is no better than a Bug.

787
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,100
<i>- One more day of fighting...
- That man is Elmo Goniff...</i>

788
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:35,100
<i>... self-proclaimed pacifist
turned terrorist.</i>

789
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:38,200
<i>And today, he and other members
of the Goniff Peace Coalition...</i>

790
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,600
<i>... are wanted in connection
with the council bombing.</i>

791
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:44,200
<i>And, hey, citizen, you can help.</i>

792
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:48,000
<i>- Know your neighbors?
- Turn that f***ing thing off.</i>

793
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,400
<i>- Take another look, citizen.
- Who, me?</i>

794
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:52,900
<i>You could be living next door
to a big, fat reward.</i>

795
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,800
<i>If you see something, say something.</i>

796
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,700
We're in the
Arachnid Quarantine Zone.

797
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:04,200
Do you know what that means?
This is a Bug planet.

798
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,300
They could come for us
at any time, right?

799
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:09,800
- Upstairs, downstairs, you can't tell.
- Save your breath, Jingo.

800
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,900
Yeah, but they could be under
our feet right now. You can't tell.

801
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:15,400
- You don't know, right?
- Listen to me, okay?

802
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,000
I'll tell you when to run.

803
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:20,200
No, you can't tell me when to run,
because I'm a cook, okay?

804
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,400
I take short orders, I'm not a...

805
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:27,000
Get your shit wired.

806
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:28,600
You're a bitch.

807
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:37,700
Let's move.

808
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,000
- You're wasting water, Jingo.
- I hate you.

809
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:12,500
- Oh, God.
- It's okay, Holly.

810
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,600
Oh, that's it, I'm out of here.

811
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:17,700
Hold your ground, Jingo.
That's an order.

812
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,400
Captain Beck, we need to talk.

813
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:27,600
We're fucked.

814
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,500
That's exactly
what I've been saying.

815
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:31,900
You shouldn't talk like that.
That's blasphemy.

816
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:35,600
You're a goddamn flight attendant,
so stow it.

817
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,400
We never should have left
the goddamn beach.

818
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:40,900
This is all a big mistake.

819
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,800
Now we got warriors...

820
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:48,600
...fucking earthquakes,
and we even lost the doc.

821
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:52,300
Did you forget that?
And it's your fault.

822
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,400
You know,
if we'd stayed at the beach...

823
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:57,900
...then we could just be lying
in the sand.

824
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:01,700
And if the Bugs did show up,
well, then we just jump in the water.

825
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:05,600
I mean, Bugs don't swim, right?
Do they?

826
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,800
- Jingo, behind you.
- Jingo, watch your back.

827
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:14,400
Yeah. Very funny.

828
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:18,800
You know what? Screw you guys.
I'm going back to the beach.

829
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:20,100
- Jingo.
- Jingo.

830
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:37,200
Jingo, don't.

831
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:38,800
Hold on, Jingo.

832
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:43,800
Damn it.

833
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:57,400
Fucker.

834
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:00,600
It's moving off.

835
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:04,500
Hold your fire. Save the ammo.

836
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:07,600
- Jingo, get out of there, now.
- No way.

837
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:09,800
We ought to get in there with him.
Let's go.

838
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,800
Chief, those aren't rocks.
Get out of there now.

839
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,400
- Come on, Holly, let's go. Sir, let's go.
- No, my friends.

840
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:19,900
He belongs to God.

841
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:23,500
What are you talking about?

842
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,700
No.

843
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,600
No, no.

844
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:14,400
No.

845
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:27,800
And where's your God now?

846
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:33,900
Let's move.

847
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:37,200
Even though you don't believe it,
captain, he is listening.

848
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:41,500
- And soon, we will be delivered.
- Do you really believe that, sir?

849
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:45,000
Yes, Holly.

850
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:48,600
I do.

851
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:57,000
How do you know?

852
01:06:57,300 --> 01:07:00,700
Because he talks to me even now,
Captain Beck.

853
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:04,600
He talks to me even now.

854
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:21,400
All right, listen up.
The hardware you'll be operating...

855
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:24,100
...interfaces directly
with your nervous system.

856
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:26,300
That's outstanding, sir.

857
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:28,900
Please remove your clothing.

858
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:41,500
What are you gonna do
if you don't buy the farm?

859
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:44,500
I'm thinking R and R.
They might even let us go home.

860
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:46,100
Home? What's that?

861
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:50,200
Peace and quiet, family.
Remember?

862
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,300
Yeah, that's all I want
when this is done.

863
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:56,300
Yeah, I just can't wait for it to be over
and start living again.

864
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:58,000
Hasn't anybody told you,
sergeants?

865
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:00,500
Mobile Infantry
is only good for dying.

866
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:03,100
They need to come up
with a bigger weapon...

867
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:05,700
...so they can finish this thing
and we can go home.

868
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:09,500
Yeah. Bye-bye, Bugs.

869
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:12,600
What will you do
when the war is over, sir?

870
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:16,300
What are you people talking about?
This war is never gonna end.

871
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:36,400
<i>Take your place, number two.</i>

872
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,700
I guess that's why
his mama called him Slug.

873
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:50,600
Prepare for full-spectrum bioscan.

874
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:53,400
<i>DDQ, five-by-five.</i>

875
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,000
<i>Commencing Gamma Jetta Bonza.</i>

876
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:35,500
Did you participate in Anoke's
interrogation of the Brain, general?

877
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:36,700
No.

878
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:39,100
So you don't know
about the side effects?

879
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:41,900
What side effects?

880
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:45,500
It seems anybody who spends
too much time around that Bug...

881
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:50,100
...suffers deleterious effects,
both physical and psychological.

882
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:53,000
- Not the sky marshal.
- So it seemed.

883
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:56,100
Truth is, we didn't fully understand
the Brain's capabilities.

884
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:14,000
- Sir.
- Welcome to Area 6, admiral.

885
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:17,900
- Necessary personnel only.
- Yes, sir.

886
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:21,600
<i>All unauthorized personnel,
exit Area 6 immediately.</i>

887
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,300
<i>All unauthorized personnel,
exit Area 6 immediately.</i>

888
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:33,100
So, general, how well
did you really know the sky marshal?

889
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:35,700
I worked with him every day.

890
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:41,600
So you knew he got religion.

891
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:44,600
- What are you talking about?
- General.

892
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:47,600
There's something
I think you should see.

893
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:53,300
Run the Anoke file.

894
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:59,800
This is surveillance footage of Anoke
with the Brain Bug.

895
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:01,600
We just recently discovered it.

896
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:05,700
He's psychically connected with it.
They communicate.

897
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:08,100
<i>I understand.</i>

898
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:11,300
<i>And I come here as your servant,
Behemecoytal.</i>

899
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:16,200
- That thing has a name?
- Yeah. But that's not this Bug.

900
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:19,600
Behemecoytal is likely some Bug
we've never encountered before.

901
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:24,400
A superior arachnid intelligence
originating on the planet OM-1.

902
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:26,800
OM-1?

903
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,400
We believe this Brain
allowed itself to be captured.

904
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:32,400
To provide intelligence
from the heart of the Federation.

905
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:35,300
And Anoke used the Brain
to commune with this Behemecoytal.

906
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:36,700
A Bug he regards as God.

907
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:39,900
<i>Yes, Roku San will fall
as proof of my faith.</i>

908
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:42,900
<i>Then we can discuss
the terms of peace.</i>

909
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:46,100
Anoke's responsible for Roku San?

910
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:49,900
He had the codes
to shut down the fences.

911
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:53,200
He made a pact with the Bug
to render Roku San defenseless.

912
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:57,000
And in light of this ...conversion

913
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:02,000
he has becom an asset to the bug
and a tremendous liability for us.

914
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:06,500
So, the real question is,
what's Anoke doing in OM-1?

915
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:10,100
Making friends?
- You can't be friends with a bug.

916
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:14,300
Nope. That's why we are going to put this one down,
take it apart and find out what it knows.

917
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,700
Close the containment.

918
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:14,900
Admiral, you okay?

919
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:17,200
Yeah.

920
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:20,400
Yeah.

921
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:22,300
Look at him.

922
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:25,500
The most powerful man in the galaxy
finds God...

923
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:27,700
...and what does he do?

924
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:29,500
Exactly what he's told.

925
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:31,800
He's a Bug.

926
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:35,800
Doesn't think, doesn't protest,
doesn't rebel.

927
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:39,200
That's the kind of attitude
that wins wars.

928
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,600
You know, Dix...

929
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:44,300
...I think these Bugs
are onto something.

930
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:53,000
This could just be
the greatest weapon of them all.

931
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:01,300
How does he do it?

932
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:04,500
That's faith, Bull.
That's what it does for a man.

933
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:06,300
Give it a break.

934
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:09,100
Faith is more powerful
than a Q-bomb.

935
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:10,700
Without it, you're nobody.

936
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:14,300
That's why I'm not listening
to you anymore, captain.

937
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:20,400
Holly, if we ever get out of this,
I was wondering if...

938
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,600
Well...

939
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:28,600
What is it, Bull?

940
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,300
Would you ever marry
an old monkey wrench like me?

941
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,500
Only in a church, Bull.

942
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,400
You mean it?

943
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:41,000
You take God and you can take me.

944
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:46,800
What we've come for.

945
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,200
It's here.

946
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:57,500
I never doubted it for a second, sir.

947
01:14:57,700 --> 01:15:00,600
If I didn't believe before, I do now.

948
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:03,800
- Honey, everything's gonna be okay.
- All will be well, Bull.

949
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:07,100
And you will know
the name of God.

950
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:09,700
The one true God.

951
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:11,200
Behemecoytal.

952
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:14,500
Brain of Brains.

953
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:18,600
- Beheme-what?
- Behemecoytal.

954
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:22,300
He's here. He's everywhere.

955
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:27,100
Come, and let us rest
and wait for his coming.

956
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:32,600
They say God has many names,
but I've never heard that one before.

957
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:35,800
Well, honey, he's the sky marshal.
He knows a lot more than we do.

958
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,400
He's talking about a Bug.

959
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:39,600
He thinks God is a Bug?

960
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:43,500
He's got religion. Their religion.

961
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:46,500
- Bug religion?
- That's crazy.

962
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:48,100
That's blasphemy.

963
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:51,200
What do we do now?

964
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:53,400
Maybe we should kill him.

965
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:58,900
Why, because he's crazy?
Or he believes in God like you?

966
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:04,800
It's the wrong God.

967
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:54,800
- Guard the door.
- I'm no trooper.

968
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,700
Greetings, citizen.

969
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:24,700
Excuse me, sir.

970
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,500
- What went wrong?
- An air leak.

971
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:41,100
The ship landed itself.

972
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:45,400
They were dead
before they hit the atmosphere.

973
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,400
Sierra Mike Uniform
to Fleet Rescue.

974
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:10,100
Come in, Fleet.

975
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:16,300
Sierra Mike Uniform to Fleet Rescue.
Come in, Fleet.

976
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:18,900
We could make orbit
if I can solve the O2 problem.

977
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:21,300
Solve it, chief.

978
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:24,400
Sierra Mike Uniform
to Fleet Rescue.

979
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:26,100
Come in.

980
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:30,700
<i>Sierra Mike Uniform,
this is Fleet Rescue, over.</i>

981
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:34,200
We are requesting priority pickup
on Planet Oscar Mike-One...

982
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:37,000
...for SM
and three additional survivors.

983
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:45,200
Holly, don't move.

984
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:50,600
Let's go, baby.

985
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:54,100
Go, baby.

986
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:08,300
Bull.

987
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:18,900
No!

988
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:21,600
No!

989
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:23,500
It's all around.

990
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:26,800
- It's Behemecoytal.
- No, it's hell.

991
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,300
- Come on, Holly.
- We're in hell!

992
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:31,700
Clear the door, Holly.

993
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:39,700
We may not be able to make orbit.

994
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,900
- But we can sure get out of here.
- We must remain here, captain.

995
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:56,600
No, sir, we are off this rock.

996
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:13,500
Oh, great one. Lord.

997
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:16,800
The day has arrived
that I stand before you.

998
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,300
Let our communion begin.

999
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:24,800
Yes.

1000
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:27,300
Yes.

1001
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:30,000
It's time to talk.

1002
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:32,200
Jingo, is that you?

1003
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:37,700
This one speaks for us
that we may talk to you as a man.

1004
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:41,900
That you may be comfortable
among your own kind.

1005
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:46,300
Among your trusted advisors
and servants...

1006
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:48,700
...whom we have made believers.

1007
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:52,100
Thank you, Lord.

1008
01:22:52,700 --> 01:22:54,800
That you care for me so much...

1009
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:58,600
...fills me with love and joy
and confidence...

1010
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:03,100
...that we can and will create
a great new understanding.

1011
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:06,000
You will be one with us.

1012
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:08,400
So that I may come to know you.

1013
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:11,000
You will know what we know.

1014
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:18,400
And that you will come to know me,
and through me...

1015
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:21,400
...all of humankind.

1016
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:23,100
What are you doing?

1017
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:25,900
I am here to negotiate peace
with a being superior to us.

1018
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:28,200
- What, appeasement?
- No, Captain Beck.

1019
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:31,500
The survival of the human race.
We will all be saved.

1020
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:39,100
Forgive me.
My people have much to learn.

1021
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:45,300
- They are fearful and...
- As were you once, Anoke.

1022
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:47,100
I was weak.

1023
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:51,800
When you asked for the lives
of so many at Roku San, I doubted.

1024
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,600
But now I understand
that great achievement...

1025
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:57,200
...requires great sacrifice.

1026
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:59,200
You gave them Roku San.

1027
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:02,600
Traitor.

1028
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:13,500
Within that woman
you will find Sanctuary.

1029
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:17,200
I have given you the key that will end
this conflict once and for all...

1030
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:20,300
...so that your law may rule
and paradise follow...

1031
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:22,600
You're a liar. Seducer.

1032
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:25,400
He of a thousand names.

1033
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:30,500
Oh, great one, Lord...

1034
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:33,900
...would you please take
these women from me and kill them?

1035
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,700
And why do you wish this?

1036
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:40,000
I have made this great journey.

1037
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:42,800
I have evolved.

1038
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,600
I have sacrificed all...

1039
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:48,100
...so that I may create with you
a great peace.

1040
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:50,400
And they're fucking it up.

1041
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:55,300
We too seek peace,
but by different means.

1042
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:58,800
We seek knowledge.

1043
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,200
Knowledge is the key
to understanding...

1044
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:03,000
...and to communication.

1045
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:06,000
And only by this way
can our species...

1046
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:11,200
...so different, live together
in harmony and mutual resp...

1047
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:20,500
You will become one with us...

1048
01:25:20,700 --> 01:25:24,100
...and provide
the knowledge necessary...

1049
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:28,300
...to pacify the human species.

1050
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:33,100
Oh, Lord. Yes.

1051
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:37,800
Your plans,
the disposition of your armies...

1052
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:39,800
...your fleet.

1053
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:42,600
Yes, what's mine is yours.

1054
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:57,100
Take me unto you, oh, great one.

1055
01:25:57,300 --> 01:25:58,900
Yes.

1056
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:03,100
Yes.

1057
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,200
Pray with me, Lola.

1058
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,200
What?

1059
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:25,100
Lord, please hear my prayer.
Deliver us from this evil place.

1060
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:30,000
- Come on, Lola, pray with me.
- It doesn't make any difference.

1061
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:34,600
Lord, send us an army of angels.

1062
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:39,200
And arm them with your fire
and your sword...

1063
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:41,600
...that they might smite
the evil around us.

1064
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:46,500
What is it, Lola?

1065
01:26:47,900 --> 01:26:49,000
Lola, what is it?

1066
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:53,000
Come on, Lola,
don't you wanna live?

1067
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:54,200
Yes, I wanna live.

1068
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:57,000
Well, when you're all out of hope,
God is all you get.

1069
01:26:57,200 --> 01:26:58,600
Now, say it.

1070
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:00,900
- Our father.
- Our father.

1071
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:04,000
- Who art in heaven.
- Who art in heaven.

1072
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:06,800
Hallowed be they name.

1073
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:20,700
- Thy kingdom come.
- Thy kingdom come.

1074
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:22,800
- Thy will be done.
- Thy will be done.

1075
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,700
- On Earth as it is in heaven.
- On Earth as it is in heaven.

1076
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:48,200
<i>All right, troopers, let's fix this hive.
Archies everywhere.</i>

1077
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:54,800
<i>As we forgive those
who trespass against us.</i>

1078
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:58,400
<i>- Searching for survivors.
- And lead us not into temptation.</i>

1079
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:00,400
<i>- Got them.
- And deliver us from evil.</i>

1080
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:01,800
Let's move in.

1081
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:04,500
<i>Rolling in.</i>

1082
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:07,800
Rolling in.

1083
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:15,900
<i>We got visual.</i>

1084
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:19,500
<i>Hold your fire.</i>

1085
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:28,900
<i>Wait for my command.</i>

1086
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:34,500
<i>- We got visual, we got contact.
- Wait for it.</i>

1087
01:28:35,700 --> 01:28:38,100
<i>Ready. Wait for it.</i>

1088
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:42,200
<i>We got contact.</i>

1089
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:43,700
I'm moving in for guns.

1090
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:47,700
<i>Keep your cool.</i>

1091
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:51,200
Hold that line, trooper.

1092
01:28:54,700 --> 01:28:55,800
Say it again, Lola. Say it again.

1093
01:28:57,100 --> 01:29:00,400
- Our father who art in heaven.
- Who art in heaven.

1094
01:29:00,700 --> 01:29:03,100
- Hallowed by thy name.
- Hallowed by thy name.

1095
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:09,000
<i>Fire in the hole.</i>

1096
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:14,600
- On Earth as it is in heaven.
- On Earth as it is in heaven.

1097
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:17,200
<i>Open up.</i>

1098
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:18,600
Everything you got.

1099
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:20,700
<i>Initiate wide dispersal on my mark.</i>

1100
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:24,400
<i>- Three, two...
- And forgive us our trespasses.</i>

1101
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:26,300
<i>Fire!</i>

1102
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:33,100
<i>Weed them out. Nothing lives.</i>

1103
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,600
<i>Get some, get some, get some.</i>

1104
01:29:48,700 --> 01:29:50,100
<i>Archie.</i>

1105
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:53,700
<i>Dual target.</i>

1106
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:57,300
- Amen.
- Amen.

1107
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:01,700
All right, cook them.

1108
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:50,600
Come on, Lola, let's go home.

1109
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:33,200
You killed a lot of Bugs
down there, John.

1110
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:36,500
- Too bad the big one got away.
- Well, it's a big Bug.

1111
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:39,500
Our guys can't tell where
the Bug ends and the planet begins.

1112
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:42,100
Hard to imagine anything
could live through all that.

1113
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:45,500
- I did.
- You're hard to kill.

1114
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:54,800
<i>The Bug is big.</i>

1115
01:31:55,100 --> 01:31:56,900
<i>We have lock.</i>

1116
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:01,100
Captain Beck.

1117
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:03,700
I've heard a lot about you.

1118
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:06,200
I'm hoping you'll take command
of my flagship.

1119
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:08,300
But when you've had
a little time off.

1120
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:09,600
Yes, ma'am.

1121
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:13,700
Congratulations, Colonel Rico.
Marauder is a big success.

1122
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:16,100
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Oh, thank Dix.

1123
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:19,500
My new number two
doesn't always take no for an answer.

1124
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:24,800
I wasn't sure we should mix
business with pleasure.

1125
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:33,900
- Are we ready to deploy the Q-bomb?
- On your command.

1126
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:37,800
All right, people.
Let's go crack a planet.

1127
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:46,200
So they wanna make you
a general, John.

1128
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:48,800
Put you in charge
of the whole Marauder program.

1129
01:32:51,700 --> 01:32:53,500
I'm only good for one thing, Dix.

1130
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:55,600
Give me a squad and let me fight.

1131
01:32:56,100 --> 01:32:58,300
At least think about it.

1132
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:01,100
Maybe you two wanna be alone.

1133
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:03,700
I'll see you on the bounce.

1134
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:12,100
<i>Alpha Gamma Bonza. Now.</i>

1135
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:15,700
I wanted to ask you...

1136
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:19,300
Would you?

1137
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:23,500
I will.

1138
01:33:23,900 --> 01:33:25,600
Really?

1139
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:29,600
- That's wonderful.
- But you need to know one thing.

1140
01:33:29,900 --> 01:33:31,000
Yeah?

1141
01:33:31,300 --> 01:33:34,200
Something happened to me
down there and...

1142
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:36,100
<i>Thirty seconds to impact.</i>

1143
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:39,600
- Something that I can't explain.
- What?

1144
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:44,300
But if you wanna marry me,
we have to do it in a church.

1145
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:47,000
<i>- What?
- Twenty seconds to impact.</i>

1146
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:51,100
I got religion, Dix. I got it bad.

1147
01:33:51,300 --> 01:33:52,900
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

1148
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:57,300
Well, nobody's perfect.

1149
01:33:57,800 --> 01:34:03,200
<i>Five, four, three, two, one.</i>

1150
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:05,900
<i>We have detonation.</i>

1151
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:25,000
<i>Sure, he's gone,
but he left us with a song.</i>

1152
01:34:33,700 --> 01:34:35,400
<i>Courage.</i>

1153
01:34:36,700 --> 01:34:38,300
<i>Duty.</i>

1154
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:41,600
<i>Honor.</i>

1155
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:50,300
<i>Millions mourn the passing
of Sky Marshal Omar Anoke.</i>

1156
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:54,600
<i>Warrior, philosopher,
a hero of the Federation.</i>

1157
01:35:08,700 --> 01:35:12,100
<i>Across the Federation,
federal experts agree that, A...</i>

1158
01:35:12,300 --> 01:35:15,500
<i>... God exists after all,
B, he's on our side...</i>

1159
01:35:15,700 --> 01:35:18,300
<i>... and, C, he wants us to win.</i>

1160
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:20,900
And there's even
more good news, believers.

1161
01:35:21,100 --> 01:35:25,100
Because it's official. God's back.

1162
01:35:25,300 --> 01:35:27,800
And he's a citizen too.

1163
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,700
<i>Bowing to a rise in popularity
all across the Federation...</i>

1164
01:35:30,900 --> 01:35:34,400
<i>... Sky Marshal Phid declares
that while religion is acceptable...</i>

1165
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:36,600
<i>... peace is not.</i>

1166
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:39,800
<i>In related news,
peace terrorist Elmo Goniff...</i>

1167
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,400
<i>... and 51 of his closest friends
were hung this morning...</i>

1168
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:46,700
<i>... in what many believe to be
the all-time record for executions...</i>

1169
01:35:46,900 --> 01:35:50,700
<i>... in a single day
since the 21 st century.</i>

1170
01:35:50,900 --> 01:35:52,600
But they can't silence you.

1171
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:56,400
F*** the Federation and f*** all of you!
You will not take my voice!

1172
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:59,500
You will not take me!
You will not take away our power!

1173
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:02,800
F*** you all! F*** you! F*** you all!

1174
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,200
F*** the Federation!

1175
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:06,800
<i>War heroes take time out
to tie the knot.</i>

1176
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:10,000
<i>Get back to work, troopers.</i>

1177
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:13,600
<i>Didn't anyone tell you?
There's a war on.</i>

1178
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:17,400
<i>So join up, do your part.</i>

1179
01:36:17,700 --> 01:36:22,300
<i>There's a long war ahead,
and we need you.</i>

1180
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,800
Are you ready for Marauder?

1181
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,300
Join the Mobile Infantry...

1182
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:42,200
...and see if you've got what it takes
to be a citizen.

1183
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:45,100
See you on the bounce, trooper.

1184
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:48,700
<i>Service guarantees citizenship.</i>
