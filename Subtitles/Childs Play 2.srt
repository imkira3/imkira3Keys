1
00:03:54,672 --> 00:03:56,047
Good morning, Mr. Sullivan.

2
00:03:56,213 --> 00:03:57,533
I have a meeting in a few minutes

3
00:03:57,588 --> 00:03:59,963
with some very jittery
stockholders, mattson.

4
00:04:01,297 --> 00:04:02,713
I hope you have good news for me.

5
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,130
Yes, sir. I do, sir.

6
00:04:06,047 --> 00:04:07,672
Every supermarket tabloid in the country

7
00:04:07,838 --> 00:04:10,755
is running headlines about Andy barclay
and his killer good guy doll.

8
00:04:10,922 --> 00:04:13,148
What about his mother and the police
that were on the case?

9
00:04:13,172 --> 00:04:14,814
The police were smart.
They denied everything,

10
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,314
which is fine because
now they can't hurt us.

11
00:04:16,338 --> 00:04:17,523
But the mother's a different matter.

12
00:04:17,547 --> 00:04:19,380
She backed up her boy's story in court,

13
00:04:19,547 --> 00:04:21,797
so now she's under
psychiatric observation.

14
00:04:21,963 --> 00:04:23,338
Jesus. Where's the boy now?

15
00:04:23,505 --> 00:04:26,880
Midtown children's crisis center.
Foster custody is pending.

16
00:04:27,838 --> 00:04:31,380
My stomach hurts, mattson.
Is this what you call good news?

17
00:04:31,547 --> 00:04:33,588
Yes...
No. I'm getting to that, sir.

18
00:04:33,755 --> 00:04:35,675
Our biggest problem
has been the rumors. A lot...

19
00:04:35,713 --> 00:04:37,380
Good morning, Mr. Sullivan.

20
00:04:37,547 --> 00:04:40,338
A lot of people are saying that
some joker here at the company

21
00:04:40,505 --> 00:04:43,797
must have tampered with the doll's
voice cassette, you know?

22
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,838
"Hi. I'm Chucky.
I'm the lakeshore strangler.

23
00:04:47,005 --> 00:04:50,838
"And now I'm gonna kill you."
Something like...

24
00:04:51,172 --> 00:04:52,838
Well, something like that.

25
00:04:53,005 --> 00:04:55,005
But the good news, Mr. Sullivan,

26
00:04:55,172 --> 00:04:57,172
is that now we've got the doll.

27
00:05:03,755 --> 00:05:05,064
We've rebuilt it from head to toe.

28
00:05:05,088 --> 00:05:07,439
A lot of it was burned to a crisp,
but everything checks out,

29
00:05:07,463 --> 00:05:08,814
the voice cassettes,
the servomechanisms.

30
00:05:08,838 --> 00:05:10,380
We've found absolutely nothing.

31
00:05:10,547 --> 00:05:11,867
This is a quality control report.

32
00:05:11,922 --> 00:05:13,882
I'm sure it will make
the stockholders very happy.

33
00:05:14,172 --> 00:05:15,672
I want to see the doll for myself.

34
00:05:16,047 --> 00:05:17,463
Absolutely.

35
00:05:18,838 --> 00:05:21,172
Gentlemen, Mr. Sullivan's here. We ready?

36
00:05:21,338 --> 00:05:23,818
Well, give us a minute. We're not used to
making them manually.

37
00:05:49,338 --> 00:05:51,547
- What's wrong?
- I don't know, it's stuck.

38
00:05:52,172 --> 00:05:53,505
Just"

39
00:05:53,963 --> 00:05:55,838
they'll have this worked out.

40
00:06:08,088 --> 00:06:09,463
0h, Jesus!

41
00:06:23,297 --> 00:06:25,838
Andy, you still
dreaming about Chucky?

42
00:06:26,797 --> 00:06:28,088
Sometimes.

43
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,547
- You want to talk about it?
- No.

44
00:06:32,255 --> 00:06:35,380
Come on, Andy. Remember what I told you?

45
00:06:36,088 --> 00:06:37,505
Talking helps make

46
00:06:37,672 --> 00:06:39,632
- the nightmares go away.
- Nightmares go away.

47
00:06:43,047 --> 00:06:46,505
Well, Chucky was
trying to take over my soul.

48
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,005
Why?

49
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,422
He was this bad man who
got inside my good guy doll,

50
00:06:51,713 --> 00:06:53,505
so he wouldn't have to go to hell.

51
00:06:54,005 --> 00:06:56,172
But then he wanted to get inside me.

52
00:06:56,755 --> 00:06:57,838
Why, Andy?

53
00:06:59,338 --> 00:07:01,380
'Cause if he stayed
inside the doll too long,

54
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:03,130
he'd be trapped in there.

55
00:07:03,505 --> 00:07:07,005
He needed me 'cause I was the first person
he told his secret to.

56
00:07:08,963 --> 00:07:09,963
What secret?

57
00:07:11,047 --> 00:07:13,380
That his real name was Charles Lee ray.

58
00:07:15,047 --> 00:07:17,630
Boy, that's a scary dream.

59
00:07:19,047 --> 00:07:20,338
It was.

60
00:07:23,672 --> 00:07:25,172
You know, dreams can't hurt you.

61
00:07:26,422 --> 00:07:27,588
Dreams aren't real.

62
00:07:28,838 --> 00:07:30,505
- Right?
- Right.

63
00:07:30,713 --> 00:07:31,963
Here.

64
00:07:32,338 --> 00:07:33,797
In there.

65
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:37,130
Let's hurry up.

66
00:07:40,797 --> 00:07:43,672
Mattson, I don't care what it takes.
Put a lid on this.

67
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,231
Yes, sir. That's not a problem.
I'll take care of this.

68
00:07:45,255 --> 00:07:46,463
Listen to me.

69
00:07:47,172 --> 00:07:50,130
You smother this or you're out of here
in 24 hours. You got that?

70
00:07:50,588 --> 00:07:51,672
Yes, sir.

71
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:55,922
Now, if you will excuse me,
I've got a meeting I've got to get to.

72
00:07:56,422 --> 00:07:58,630
As far as the stockholders
and I are concerned,

73
00:07:59,088 --> 00:08:00,463
this matter is finished.

74
00:08:00,672 --> 00:08:01,797
Yes, sir.

75
00:08:01,963 --> 00:08:03,755
Uh, what do you want me to do
with the doll?

76
00:08:05,255 --> 00:08:06,880
Stick it up your ass.

77
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,672
Naturally, he was badly
traumatized by the murders,

78
00:08:13,838 --> 00:08:16,713
but they bounce back
pretty fast at that age.

79
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,213
Poor kid.

80
00:08:18,505 --> 00:08:23,255
What Andy needs now is a normal
family environment, a fresh start

81
00:08:23,422 --> 00:08:25,338
and a chance to forget the past.

82
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:29,297
Since you two have done so well
with so many kids,

83
00:08:29,463 --> 00:08:32,422
we were hoping you might foster him
until his mother recovers.

84
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,672
- There's always room for one more.
- Mm.

85
00:08:35,255 --> 00:08:36,463
What's that supposed to mean?

86
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,713
Uh, well...

87
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:45,963
He seems normal enough,
but how has all this affected him?

88
00:08:47,213 --> 00:08:48,797
Well, in order to come to terms with

89
00:08:48,963 --> 00:08:51,172
something he couldn't possibly understand,

90
00:08:51,338 --> 00:08:54,505
he turned it all into
a kind of fairy tale.

91
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,797
He insisted his do" was responsible.

92
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,713
He said it was possessed
by the soul of Charles Lee ray.

93
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,880
Who?

94
00:09:04,755 --> 00:09:06,255
The lakeshore strangler.

95
00:09:06,422 --> 00:09:13,005
He murdered a dozen people
in this series of ritual voodoo killings.

96
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,630
Are we even qualified
to take care of a boy like this?

97
00:09:20,838 --> 00:09:22,797
Well, I understand
your concern, Mr. Simpson,

98
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:25,380
but I'm sure you can see that
this is just a child's way

99
00:09:25,547 --> 00:09:28,505
of coping with a difficult situation.

100
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,963
Andy's fine now.

101
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,880
He just wants to get on with his life.

102
00:09:41,672 --> 00:09:43,880
So, Andy, what do you like to eat?

103
00:09:44,547 --> 00:09:46,088
All kinds of things.

104
00:09:46,963 --> 00:09:49,713
Well, what's your very favorite food
in the whole wide world?

105
00:09:50,088 --> 00:09:51,088
Chocolate.

106
00:09:52,713 --> 00:09:54,297
Besides chocolate.

107
00:09:54,463 --> 00:09:59,422
Mm. My mom used to fix
me eggs for breakfast. I like eggs.

108
00:09:59,588 --> 00:10:02,463
You got it. We should stop at the store.

109
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:05,110
- Uh, the one down here?
- Yeah, the organic...

110
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,838
You're in luck, Andy.
Joanne's a terrific cook.

111
00:10:10,547 --> 00:10:13,047
You like Sushi? You know what I mean by...

112
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:14,213
Phil, look out!

113
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,005
Jesus Christ!

114
00:10:39,255 --> 00:10:41,047
Look out for the car.

115
00:10:41,213 --> 00:10:43,130
Hey, wait up.

116
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,297
Make yourself comfortable, Andy.

117
00:10:55,463 --> 00:10:56,880
Thanks.

118
00:11:01,755 --> 00:11:04,380
Well, I have to get
back to the office this afternoon.

119
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,547
I thought that
you'd done everything.

120
00:11:40,672 --> 00:11:41,838
Ah-ah-ah...

121
00:11:42,922 --> 00:11:45,755
First rule. Don't touch the old stuff.

122
00:11:45,922 --> 00:11:46,922
Sorry.

123
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:48,297
Well, that's okay. No foul.

124
00:11:48,463 --> 00:11:51,213
It's just that we collect this junk,

125
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,880
and a lot of it's kind of fragile.

126
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,797
- You like it?
- Uh-huh.

127
00:11:56,005 --> 00:11:58,088
It's been in my family
for three generations.

128
00:11:58,255 --> 00:12:01,338
My grandmother gave it to my mother,
and my mother gave it to me.

129
00:12:01,713 --> 00:12:03,713
And who are you gonna give it to?

130
00:12:06,255 --> 00:12:08,015
Why don't you take this upstairs
and explore?

131
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,290
I'll be up there in a minute.

132
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,380
Okay.

133
00:12:17,672 --> 00:12:19,380
What do you think?

134
00:12:21,422 --> 00:12:22,838
0h, I'll get used to him.

135
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,755
Jesus. Did you ever hear of knocking?

136
00:12:45,463 --> 00:12:47,088
Andy, did you find...

137
00:12:47,505 --> 00:12:50,130
What? Are you crazy? Give them to me.

138
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:52,088
Come on, joanne.

139
00:12:52,255 --> 00:12:53,898
Phil will shoot you
if he catches you again.

140
00:12:53,922 --> 00:12:56,922
Andy, this is Kyle.
She's staying with us, too.

141
00:12:57,755 --> 00:12:59,005
Charmed.

142
00:12:59,255 --> 00:13:01,172
Kyle, what is this?

143
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,672
You've been here three weeks.
Why haven't you unpacked?

144
00:13:04,838 --> 00:13:06,588
What for?

145
00:13:06,755 --> 00:13:08,755
I've never spent more
than a month in any home.

146
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:11,435
With that attitude, I can see why.

147
00:13:11,547 --> 00:13:12,689
Come on. Put these things away,

148
00:13:12,713 --> 00:13:15,189
and then would you do me a favor
and help me get dinner started?

149
00:13:15,213 --> 00:13:17,088
Can't. Got to work tonight.

150
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,672
Kyle, that's the third night in a row.

151
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,755
I'd really like it if you'd spend
a little time with the family.

152
00:13:23,797 --> 00:13:26,797
I need the money.
I'm gonna be on my own next year.

153
00:13:27,213 --> 00:13:30,172
Yes, well, until then,
you're with us, okay?

154
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:35,130
- Come along, Andy.
- Bye.

155
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,088
I think you'll be very happy here.

156
00:13:42,963 --> 00:13:44,838
This is your room, right here.

157
00:13:54,088 --> 00:13:55,880
I made those curtains just for you.

158
00:13:56,047 --> 00:13:57,838
I bet blue is your favorite color.

159
00:13:58,005 --> 00:14:00,630
Take a look around. I'll start to unpack.

160
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,255
Wow!

161
00:14:07,088 --> 00:14:11,422
I thought you might like those. Um...
There's more in the closet.

162
00:14:13,088 --> 00:14:16,130
Before dinner,
we'll go explore the backyard.

163
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,380
And, later, I'll read you some stories.

164
00:14:19,088 --> 00:14:20,672
Would you like that?

165
00:14:20,922 --> 00:14:23,064
There are lots of kids your age
in the neighborhood, Andy.

166
00:14:23,088 --> 00:14:25,880
I'm sure you're gonna make
all sorts of new friends.

167
00:14:30,797 --> 00:14:32,047
Hey, hey, hey!

168
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,088
Andy, rule number two,
no running in the house.

169
00:14:35,755 --> 00:14:38,672
It's only a doll.
Andy, are you listening to me?

170
00:14:38,838 --> 00:14:41,713
0h, Andy, I'm so sorry.
I didn't realize that was in there.

171
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,064
We've had so many kids here,
it's hard to keep track of everything.

172
00:14:44,088 --> 00:14:45,213
I'll get rid of it.

173
00:14:45,505 --> 00:14:48,380
Hi, I'm Tommy.
And I'm your friend till the end.

174
00:14:48,547 --> 00:14:52,172
Why don't we get settled in,
and then we'll have some dinner, okay?

175
00:15:04,838 --> 00:15:06,088
Shit.

176
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,547
Hello, Gabriella. Guess who?

177
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,713
That's right.

178
00:16:00,297 --> 00:16:01,422
The vodka? Oh, the vodka.

179
00:16:01,588 --> 00:16:03,130
Of course I remembered
the vodka.

180
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:05,752
Two-week anniversary.
You think I'd forget the vodka?

181
00:16:06,422 --> 00:16:07,713
I know what that does to you.

182
00:16:09,088 --> 00:16:10,547
Okay, well, wait for me.

183
00:16:11,588 --> 00:16:13,338
On my way. Yeah.

184
00:16:14,797 --> 00:16:16,088
Shit.

185
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,713
I want to play red light.

186
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,922
No, Sammy, I don't want to
play red light now.

187
00:16:57,088 --> 00:16:58,648
I want you to go back to bed right now.

188
00:16:58,755 --> 00:17:00,172
But I'm scared.

189
00:17:00,755 --> 00:17:03,463
There's nothing to be scared of.
It's just a storm.

190
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,380
Grace poole.

191
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,922
Yes, I'm trying to
reach Andy barclay.

192
00:17:12,422 --> 00:17:14,755
Andy no longer lives here. Who is this?

193
00:17:15,797 --> 00:17:18,005
This is his uncle Charles.

194
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:22,172
Sorry, cash only.

195
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,505
But that's a gold card.
That's just as good as cash.

196
00:17:25,672 --> 00:17:28,672
Not here, it ain't.
We don't accept credit cards.

197
00:17:29,297 --> 00:17:31,463
I don't carry cash, okay?

198
00:17:33,213 --> 00:17:34,547
Oh...

199
00:18:17,005 --> 00:18:18,172
Don't move!

200
00:18:18,338 --> 00:18:19,463
Jesus!

201
00:18:19,922 --> 00:18:23,213
God. Okay. Okay, what do you want?

202
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:26,880
- No questions. Just drive.
- Okay, okay.

203
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:35,255
Keep going.

204
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,630
Now, park this piece of shit.

205
00:19:02,838 --> 00:19:04,880
Put your arms behind the seat.

206
00:19:05,047 --> 00:19:07,130
- What?
- Do it!

207
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:12,255
Okay. Take it easy. Take it easy.
Please, don't, don't shoot.

208
00:19:12,505 --> 00:19:16,255
Look, I... I don't carry cash.
I got... I got a gold card.

209
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:18,588
I'll give you anything you want.
Tell me what you want.

210
00:19:18,755 --> 00:19:20,838
Freeze, asshole.

211
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,240
Take my... take the car.

212
00:19:24,588 --> 00:19:27,588
And you can drop me off,
but just, please, leave me alone.

213
00:19:27,797 --> 00:19:29,047
Please.

214
00:19:29,255 --> 00:19:30,838
Bang. You're dead.

215
00:19:48,963 --> 00:19:51,838
No! No! No!

216
00:19:55,463 --> 00:19:58,713
No! No! No!

217
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:56,088
"The woodcutter argued
for a long time with his wife,

218
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,922
but she was such a horrid,
frightening woman when she was angry,

219
00:20:59,088 --> 00:21:01,630
that in the end he agreed to her plan.

220
00:21:03,172 --> 00:21:05,213
In the morning,
their stepmother called them.

221
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,463
'I think it would be nice if we all went
into the forest today, ' she said.

222
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,005
Hansel and gretel did not reply,

223
00:21:11,172 --> 00:21:13,588
but followed their parents
into the dark forest."

224
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,505
Where they all lived happily ever after.

225
00:21:17,172 --> 00:21:19,047
- No, they don't.
- Well, they do for now.

226
00:21:19,213 --> 00:21:20,880
We'll finish it tomorrow night, okay?

227
00:21:22,755 --> 00:21:23,880
Don't go.

228
00:21:24,047 --> 00:21:25,463
What's the matter?

229
00:21:26,713 --> 00:21:27,922
I miss my mother.

230
00:21:28,088 --> 00:21:29,588
Oh, honey, I know you do.

231
00:21:30,297 --> 00:21:31,713
Will I ever see her again?

232
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,505
Of course you will. I promise.

233
00:21:35,547 --> 00:21:39,338
Don't worry. I'll stay with you
as long as you want.

234
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:44,922
My mother used to sing to me.
Will you sing to me?

235
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:20,130
Shit.

236
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,672
Hi. I'm Tommy.

237
00:22:22,255 --> 00:22:23,755
Shut up, you idiot.

238
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,713
I like to be hugged.
I like to be hugged.

239
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,963
I like to be hugged.
I like to be hugged.

240
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:31,172
- I like to be hugged.
- Hug this.

241
00:22:31,672 --> 00:22:34,255
I like to be hugged.
I like to be hugged. I like...

242
00:22:36,297 --> 00:22:39,255
- What was that?
- Nothing. Now go to sleep.

243
00:22:39,672 --> 00:22:41,713
Nobody's going to hurt you.

244
00:23:17,047 --> 00:23:19,088
Eat dirt, Tommy.

245
00:23:26,797 --> 00:23:29,880
Do either of you have anything to
say about this?

246
00:23:30,797 --> 00:23:32,630
I think we should talk to a lawyer first.

247
00:23:32,797 --> 00:23:36,505
Kyle, that's not funny.
That statue was very important to me.

248
00:23:37,838 --> 00:23:40,797
I think one of you owes joanne an apology.

249
00:23:41,422 --> 00:23:42,547
I'm innocent.

250
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:44,672
Andy?

251
00:23:45,672 --> 00:23:46,963
I didn't do it.

252
00:23:48,838 --> 00:23:52,213
All right. You leave me no choice.

253
00:23:52,672 --> 00:23:54,963
Until somebody fesses up,
you're both grounded.

254
00:23:56,047 --> 00:23:57,505
But I have a date tonight.

255
00:23:57,797 --> 00:23:58,838
Sorry.

256
00:24:01,672 --> 00:24:05,380
This is exactly how I wanted
to spend my day off. Thanks a lot.

257
00:24:05,713 --> 00:24:07,838
But I didn't break the statue. Really.

258
00:24:08,005 --> 00:24:10,463
Yeah. Maybe it just fell, huh?

259
00:24:12,505 --> 00:24:15,255
Hey. You want to hear me
say your name backwards?

260
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,380
Kyle.

261
00:24:19,838 --> 00:24:20,838
Hold this.

262
00:24:28,588 --> 00:24:30,797
Jesus. Give me that.

263
00:24:31,797 --> 00:24:33,189
What the hell do you think you're doing?

264
00:24:33,213 --> 00:24:34,505
I wanted to taste it.

265
00:24:35,005 --> 00:24:37,088
Get real. It tastes like shit, okay?

266
00:24:37,255 --> 00:24:38,713
These things are very bad for you.

267
00:24:39,005 --> 00:24:40,672
Then why do you do it?

268
00:24:40,838 --> 00:24:43,838
Because grown-ups are allowed to
do things that are bad for them.

269
00:24:44,922 --> 00:24:46,172
You're not a grown-up.

270
00:24:48,172 --> 00:24:49,852
You're beginning to
get on my nerves, Andy.

271
00:24:50,672 --> 00:24:52,463
Now, why don't you
give me a hand over here?

272
00:24:57,672 --> 00:25:00,422
Mr. Simpson is kind of grouchy, isn't he?

273
00:25:01,255 --> 00:25:02,338
He's not so bad.

274
00:25:02,838 --> 00:25:04,318
I've had fosters that would shoot you

275
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,672
for staring at them cross-eyed.

276
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,880
Really?

277
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,047
Sure.

278
00:25:08,213 --> 00:25:10,523
They figure you're not theirs.
You're just passing through.

279
00:25:10,547 --> 00:25:12,338
The minute you screw up...

280
00:25:12,505 --> 00:25:14,297
Argh! They let you have it.

281
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,463
You know, I got to tell you,
I'm not happy with this whole thing.

282
00:25:25,922 --> 00:25:27,213
Having second thoughts?

283
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:31,255
Well, you have to admit,
he's a very troubled little boy,

284
00:25:31,422 --> 00:25:34,797
and he obviously has not come to terms
with this whole doll thing.

285
00:25:37,338 --> 00:25:40,297
Look, all I'm saying is that he may need

286
00:25:40,463 --> 00:25:43,880
more attention than we can give him.

287
00:25:44,963 --> 00:25:47,463
Phil, Andy's been through hell.

288
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:50,380
You have to give him some time.
He'll settle down.

289
00:25:51,422 --> 00:25:53,922
Besides, I like him.

290
00:26:11,922 --> 00:26:13,005
I hate you.

291
00:26:14,088 --> 00:26:18,005
Hi. I'm... Tommy,
and I'm your friend to the end.

292
00:26:18,172 --> 00:26:19,797
Hidey-ho.

293
00:27:08,922 --> 00:27:10,797
Kyle, do you miss your mom and dad?

294
00:27:12,963 --> 00:27:14,547
You can't miss someone you never knew.

295
00:27:15,463 --> 00:27:16,880
Where are they?

296
00:27:18,172 --> 00:27:19,547
I have no idea.

297
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:21,630
My dad left before I was born.

298
00:27:22,297 --> 00:27:24,630
My mom put me up for adoption
when I was three.

299
00:27:26,422 --> 00:27:27,838
Do you remember her?

300
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,380
I made it a point to forget.

301
00:27:33,172 --> 00:27:34,505
It's easier that way.

302
00:27:36,213 --> 00:27:38,797
Hey. Break time.

303
00:27:39,422 --> 00:27:40,505
Move over.

304
00:27:41,838 --> 00:27:42,922
Want a push?

305
00:27:43,088 --> 00:27:44,422
No, thank you.

306
00:27:44,672 --> 00:27:46,088
Come on. It's fun.

307
00:27:46,255 --> 00:27:48,422
Come on, Andy, please,
I just want to sit here, okay?

308
00:27:48,755 --> 00:27:50,630
Too late. There you go.

309
00:27:50,797 --> 00:27:54,130
Andy, come on. Give me a break. Stop it.

310
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:55,880
No.

311
00:27:57,588 --> 00:27:59,348
Andy, I'll kill you.

312
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,463
Come on. Let me off!

313
00:28:04,505 --> 00:28:05,672
Andy.

314
00:28:06,755 --> 00:28:07,755
I'll get you.

315
00:28:09,213 --> 00:28:10,755
- Come on, Andy, cut it out.
- Dinner!

316
00:28:11,422 --> 00:28:12,880
- Come and get it.
- Whoa.

317
00:28:13,088 --> 00:28:14,255
Aah!

318
00:28:14,422 --> 00:28:16,255
Mayhem. Come on. I'll race you.

319
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,422
No fair. You got a head start.

320
00:28:19,588 --> 00:28:22,672
Excuses, excuses. Don't forget your doll.

321
00:29:33,047 --> 00:29:34,755
For Kyle. Think she'll like it?

322
00:29:34,922 --> 00:29:37,047
What do I know
about teenage girls?

323
00:29:37,213 --> 00:29:38,573
More than you did three weeks ago.

324
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:39,880
I'm not so sure.

325
00:29:40,047 --> 00:29:41,689
I was thinking we should
get something for Andy.

326
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:44,047
Make him feel more settled. Any ideas?

327
00:29:44,213 --> 00:29:45,547
Yeah. How about a valium?

328
00:29:55,213 --> 00:29:56,588
Surprise.

329
00:29:57,213 --> 00:30:00,380
Did you miss me, Andy? I sure missed you.

330
00:30:00,672 --> 00:30:02,463
I told you.

331
00:30:02,672 --> 00:30:05,630
We were gonna be friends to the end.

332
00:30:05,838 --> 00:30:09,213
And now it's time to play.

333
00:30:10,047 --> 00:30:11,755
I got a new game, sport.

334
00:30:12,213 --> 00:30:16,463
It's called hide the soul.

335
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:19,838
And guess what? You're it.

336
00:30:26,588 --> 00:30:29,005
Give me the power, I beg...

337
00:30:31,213 --> 00:30:32,547
This isn't over, you little shit.

338
00:30:32,713 --> 00:30:35,463
I'm not gonna spend the rest of my life
as a plastic freak.

339
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:37,297
Next time you're alone, you're mine.

340
00:30:41,588 --> 00:30:43,505
Oh, my god.

341
00:30:46,713 --> 00:30:48,047
It's Chucky. Look out!

342
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:50,314
- Shut up. You'll wake Phil and joanne.
- Kill him! Kill him!

343
00:30:50,338 --> 00:30:51,713
Andy, stop it, will you?

344
00:30:52,963 --> 00:30:54,505
What the hell is this, now?

345
00:30:54,672 --> 00:30:58,630
It's Chucky. I told you he'd find me.
He tried to take over my soul.

346
00:30:58,797 --> 00:31:00,172
Andy, calm down.

347
00:31:00,963 --> 00:31:02,213
You didn't have to wait up.

348
00:31:02,588 --> 00:31:05,505
Yeah? You know, Kyle, I don't believe you.

349
00:31:05,672 --> 00:31:08,463
You actually tied this child up,
so he wouldn't tell on you.

350
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:10,338
- Is that it?
- Oh, come on, Phil.

351
00:31:10,505 --> 00:31:11,814
- Chucky did it!
- That's enough now.

352
00:31:11,838 --> 00:31:13,713
Chucky? I... I've had it.

353
00:31:15,963 --> 00:31:17,422
But you've got to kill him.

354
00:31:17,588 --> 00:31:18,797
Andy!

355
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:23,172
Please, listen to me. I'm not lying.

356
00:31:23,338 --> 00:31:25,047
If you don't kill him, he'll come get me.

357
00:31:25,213 --> 00:31:27,338
Andy, calm down.

358
00:31:27,755 --> 00:31:28,963
I'm going to get rid of it.

359
00:31:34,213 --> 00:31:36,922
There, see? He's gone.
He can't bother you anymore.

360
00:31:50,838 --> 00:31:52,922
I'm turning human again?

361
00:31:53,547 --> 00:31:56,588
If I don't get out
of this body soon, I'm screwed.

362
00:32:01,005 --> 00:32:02,880
Come on, Andy. We're late.

363
00:32:03,047 --> 00:32:05,630
Andy. Don't forget your lunch.

364
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,880
Egg salad.

365
00:32:09,213 --> 00:32:10,588
Mmm, yum!

366
00:32:21,047 --> 00:32:23,630
Now, whatever you do,
don't act nervous, okay?

367
00:32:23,797 --> 00:32:27,005
They'll smell a new kid a mile off.
Just act like you belong.

368
00:32:27,797 --> 00:32:28,838
What are you looking for?

369
00:32:29,005 --> 00:32:30,005
Nothing.

370
00:32:30,588 --> 00:32:32,547
Is it Chucky coming to get you?

371
00:32:35,463 --> 00:32:38,172
Andy, how did you manage
to tie yourself up like that last night?

372
00:32:38,338 --> 00:32:39,713
I already told you.

373
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,005
Get real.

374
00:32:42,005 --> 00:32:45,255
You're just like everybody else.
You don't believe me either.

375
00:32:46,838 --> 00:32:48,172
- Kyle.
- Hey, Autumn.

376
00:32:48,338 --> 00:32:49,380
Hi.

377
00:32:49,547 --> 00:32:52,227
Why'd you have to leave so early
last night? You missed all the fun.

378
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,297
Story of my life.

379
00:33:52,255 --> 00:33:55,463
Come on now.

380
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,047
Where is it?

381
00:33:58,005 --> 00:33:59,505
Where is it?

382
00:34:02,505 --> 00:34:03,713
Ah-ha!

383
00:34:04,588 --> 00:34:09,088
"Pinocchio jumped forjoy, shouting,
'I'm alive! I'm alive!'

384
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:12,172
then the talking cricket said..."
What'd he say?

385
00:34:12,338 --> 00:34:16,672
"'If you're very, very good,
and promise to tell no lies,

386
00:34:16,838 --> 00:34:19,463
then you will become a real, live boy.'

387
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:22,213
boys who are bent on
following their caprices

388
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:26,463
and will have their own way,
sooner or later repent."

389
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,588
Get lost, microchip.

390
00:34:28,922 --> 00:34:30,505
Am I boring you, Andy?

391
00:34:31,255 --> 00:34:32,338
No, miss...

392
00:34:32,505 --> 00:34:33,922
Kettlewell.

393
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:35,797
Kettlewell.

394
00:34:35,963 --> 00:34:38,838
I have precious little Patience
for disruptive students.

395
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,088
But he just whacked...

396
00:34:41,255 --> 00:34:43,630
Especially new students,
whose utmost concern

397
00:34:43,797 --> 00:34:45,630
should be getting on my good side.

398
00:34:47,755 --> 00:34:50,838
I want those desks spick
and span before anyone leaves.

399
00:35:10,505 --> 00:35:13,005
Andy! You think this is funny?

400
00:35:13,172 --> 00:35:15,880
I didn't do that.

401
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:18,838
Go ahead, kids. Don't forget
the spelling test tomorrow.

402
00:35:19,005 --> 00:35:22,255
Not you. Come over here.
Sit down and get comfy.

403
00:35:22,422 --> 00:35:23,922
You're going to be here for a while.

404
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:25,838
But I didn't do it, I swear.

405
00:35:26,005 --> 00:35:28,005
No? Then who did?

406
00:35:29,755 --> 00:35:31,713
Don't even think about it.

407
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:35,630
No toys. Head down.

408
00:35:49,755 --> 00:35:51,422
Head down.

409
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:35,990
Peekaboo!

410
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:39,797
Please, let me out of here, Andy.

411
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,047
It's dark in here.

412
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:46,797
I promise I won't kill anyone else. Okay?

413
00:36:47,797 --> 00:36:49,588
Now, open the goddamn door!

414
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:53,463
Let me out, you little dick!

415
00:36:54,505 --> 00:36:56,005
Let me the fuck out!

416
00:37:14,213 --> 00:37:18,130
Andy, I told you to stay in your seat.
Come out of there.

417
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,630
Open this door right now.

418
00:37:28,047 --> 00:37:29,713
Andy, come out this very second.

419
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,838
Andy! Andy!

420
00:37:34,047 --> 00:37:35,255
Andy?

421
00:37:52,297 --> 00:37:53,630
Andy?

422
00:38:02,963 --> 00:38:04,630
Andy, this isn't funny.

423
00:38:34,463 --> 00:38:40,463
You've been very naughty, miss kettlewell.

424
00:39:07,213 --> 00:39:08,588
Andy, what's this all about?

425
00:39:08,963 --> 00:39:13,255
Chucky followed me to school.
He tried to get me again, so I ran home.

426
00:39:14,547 --> 00:39:16,338
Do you know what's he talking about?

427
00:39:16,505 --> 00:39:17,505
His teacher called,

428
00:39:17,672 --> 00:39:20,422
said she was keeping him
after school for detention,

429
00:39:20,588 --> 00:39:23,505
said he wrote an obscenity on his paper.

430
00:39:24,505 --> 00:39:25,755
Chucky did it.

431
00:39:27,755 --> 00:39:29,588
All right, Andy. Come on.

432
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,338
This is going to stop,

433
00:39:31,505 --> 00:39:33,481
'cause I will not allow this
foolishness in my house.

434
00:39:33,505 --> 00:39:34,838
Do you understand? Open the door.

435
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:37,422
- Oh, Phil.
- Joanne, please.

436
00:39:41,172 --> 00:39:42,172
Open the door.

437
00:39:45,338 --> 00:39:46,422
Open it.

438
00:39:50,422 --> 00:39:51,505
Open it!

439
00:39:59,255 --> 00:40:01,615
Now, I want you to look down there
and tell me what you see.

440
00:40:04,505 --> 00:40:05,505
It's Chucky, but...

441
00:40:05,672 --> 00:40:08,963
His name is Tommy,

442
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:11,880
and he's been there
since last night, hasn't he?

443
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,047
Hasn't he?

444
00:40:20,547 --> 00:40:24,338
For crying out loud, joanne,
the child needs professional help.

445
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,305
Oh, stop pretending
you're worried about Andy.

446
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,939
You never wanted him
here in the first place.

447
00:40:27,963 --> 00:40:29,463
That's not true.

448
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,963
So, what are you
suggesting we do? Send him back?

449
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:34,130
You don't have to make
it sound so horrible.

450
00:40:34,213 --> 00:40:36,481
Do you have any idea
how traumatic that would be?

451
00:40:36,505 --> 00:40:40,713
Traum... for whom, joanne,
for him or for you?

452
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:44,755
Look, if that kid stays here,
he's gonna tear this family apart.

453
00:40:45,088 --> 00:40:47,463
Family? Is this what you calla family?

454
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:49,713
Families don't just
give up on their children.

455
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,547
Joanne, he's not our child.

456
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,422
It's not the end of the world.

457
00:41:04,922 --> 00:41:06,505
But they're gonna send me away.

458
00:41:13,588 --> 00:41:14,880
You'll be okay.

459
00:41:16,963 --> 00:41:18,172
Where will I go?

460
00:41:19,213 --> 00:41:20,297
Andy.

461
00:41:22,505 --> 00:41:24,755
I've lived with dozens
of different families,

462
00:41:26,755 --> 00:41:28,463
and they always seem to send me away

463
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:30,130
just when I'm getting comfortable,

464
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:32,547
- but you know what?
- What?

465
00:41:33,005 --> 00:41:36,672
Every time it happens,
it just makes me stronger,

466
00:41:37,005 --> 00:41:40,588
because it reminds me that the only one
I can count on is myself.

467
00:41:41,963 --> 00:41:43,463
Okay? And you have to learn that now.

468
00:41:45,713 --> 00:41:47,338
I know it sounds tough,

469
00:41:48,338 --> 00:41:49,755
but you'll deal with it.

470
00:41:51,922 --> 00:41:53,213
It doesn't matter.

471
00:41:54,338 --> 00:41:57,088
Wherever I go, Chucky will find me.

472
00:46:02,713 --> 00:46:04,106
Advances over the declines

473
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:05,672
by a seven to six margin.

474
00:46:05,838 --> 00:46:07,380
Decent today, with the...

475
00:46:08,797 --> 00:46:09,838
What's wrong?

476
00:46:10,588 --> 00:46:12,713
I thought I heard something downstairs.

477
00:46:13,005 --> 00:46:14,172
It's one of the children.

478
00:46:14,797 --> 00:46:16,005
That's what I'm afraid of.

479
00:46:21,588 --> 00:46:24,630
Why fight it, Andy?
We're gonna be very close.

480
00:46:24,797 --> 00:46:28,088
In fact, we're gonna be
fucking inseparable.

481
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:40,868
What the hell's going on down...

482
00:46:43,297 --> 00:46:44,380
Andy...

483
00:46:45,797 --> 00:46:46,797
Put down the knife.

484
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:48,463
But I need it for...

485
00:46:49,922 --> 00:46:53,297
Just put the knife down,
and we'll talk about it.

486
00:47:03,588 --> 00:47:05,547
Everything is gonna be just fine.

487
00:47:23,297 --> 00:47:24,672
How's it hanging, Phil?

488
00:47:35,255 --> 00:47:39,130
No. Oh, god. Phil. Phil.

489
00:47:40,422 --> 00:47:42,255
I'll call an ambulance.

490
00:47:42,463 --> 00:47:43,922
Phil. Phil.

491
00:47:46,088 --> 00:47:48,047
Oh, god! No!

492
00:47:48,213 --> 00:47:49,838
Oh, god! Oh!

493
00:47:52,047 --> 00:47:53,047
Get away from me!

494
00:47:56,713 --> 00:47:57,797
Oh, god!

495
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:09,088
No, we didn't
hear anything. Nothing.

496
00:48:36,088 --> 00:48:37,422
I should have listened to him.

497
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:40,670
He'd have been here now if only
I'd listened to him.

498
00:48:46,172 --> 00:48:48,172
It's not your fault.

499
00:48:55,088 --> 00:48:56,380
I'll take care of this.

500
00:49:08,088 --> 00:49:10,380
Andy, you'll be fine now.

501
00:49:10,755 --> 00:49:13,463
You'll come stay at
the center with us for a few days

502
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:15,588
until we can find you a new family.

503
00:49:16,922 --> 00:49:19,172
We've placed Kyle with
a number of families.

504
00:49:20,213 --> 00:49:21,880
Things always seem to work out okay.

505
00:49:22,963 --> 00:49:24,047
Don't they?

506
00:49:24,838 --> 00:49:26,088
Yeah.

507
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:30,880
There's your stuff.

508
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:35,672
Come on, Andy. Let's go.

509
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:41,672
He's still in the cellar, Kyle.
Don't let him get you, too.

510
00:49:41,922 --> 00:49:43,047
Andy?

511
00:49:57,505 --> 00:49:59,345
We'll be out of your way
in just a minute here.

512
00:49:59,922 --> 00:50:02,213
Did anyone, besides the boy,
witness the accident?

513
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:05,838
- Okay.

514
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:07,297
Let's go.

515
00:52:20,963 --> 00:52:22,422
Joanne!

516
00:52:23,005 --> 00:52:24,255
Joanne!

517
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:19,297
Joanne?

518
00:54:33,338 --> 00:54:34,463
Joanne!

519
00:55:43,255 --> 00:55:45,088
Bitch. You hurt me.

520
00:55:51,672 --> 00:55:53,505
How much further till we get to the kid?

521
00:55:53,672 --> 00:55:54,838
A ways.

522
00:55:55,005 --> 00:55:56,297
Step on it.

523
00:55:56,630 --> 00:55:57,755
What's the rush?

524
00:55:57,922 --> 00:56:01,463
If I don't get out of this body soon,
I'll be trapped in here!

525
00:56:03,172 --> 00:56:04,505
What are you looking at?

526
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:16,505
Floor it.

527
00:56:16,672 --> 00:56:18,463
Get real. This is a station wagon.

528
00:56:19,297 --> 00:56:20,838
Shit!

529
00:56:21,672 --> 00:56:22,797
Pull over.

530
00:56:35,338 --> 00:56:37,380
Behave yourself.

531
00:56:37,588 --> 00:56:39,088
I'll kill you if I have to.

532
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:43,630
Okay, honey, let's see your license.

533
00:56:49,047 --> 00:56:52,088
You were clocking 60 in a 45.
What's your hurry?

534
00:56:53,838 --> 00:56:54,922
I have a date.

535
00:56:55,797 --> 00:56:57,397
You're gonna have
to do better than that.

536
00:56:59,547 --> 00:57:01,147
That's one of those good guys, isn't it?

537
00:57:02,588 --> 00:57:03,838
Yes, it is.

538
00:57:04,088 --> 00:57:06,130
I love these things.
What's your name, buddy?

539
00:57:08,588 --> 00:57:10,213
Chucky.

540
00:57:10,588 --> 00:57:11,838
That's incredible.

541
00:57:13,213 --> 00:57:14,213
I'll say.

542
00:57:15,088 --> 00:57:16,088
What the hell's that?

543
00:57:23,255 --> 00:57:24,630
You've seen dolls that pee?

544
00:57:25,588 --> 00:57:27,463
This one bleeds.

545
00:57:32,172 --> 00:57:33,255
Okay, look,

546
00:57:34,088 --> 00:57:35,297
just slow it down, huh?

547
00:57:36,213 --> 00:57:39,088
And buckle up for safety.

548
00:57:45,047 --> 00:57:46,547
Now, get going.

549
00:57:56,547 --> 00:57:57,630
You okay, honey?

550
00:57:58,130 --> 00:57:59,297
Mmm-hmm.

551
00:57:59,755 --> 00:58:01,880
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

552
00:58:21,297 --> 00:58:23,005
Come on. Step on it.

553
00:58:24,713 --> 00:58:27,172
Fine. We'll just get pulled over again.

554
00:58:27,922 --> 00:58:32,922
Just shut up and drive
before I kick your fucking teeth in.

555
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:47,005
You goddamn women drivers!

556
00:58:57,963 --> 00:58:59,588
Fuck.

557
00:59:01,005 --> 00:59:02,422
Fucking bastard.

558
00:59:19,797 --> 00:59:21,255
Shit. Andy.

559
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:50,047
Playtime's over.

560
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:35,255
Andy, what are you doing?

561
01:00:35,422 --> 01:00:37,222
Come on. We've got to get
out of the building.

562
01:00:39,255 --> 01:00:41,297
Kyle, what's going on here?

563
01:00:44,755 --> 01:00:46,005
You did this, didn't you?

564
01:00:49,422 --> 01:00:50,422
He did it.

565
01:00:52,672 --> 01:00:53,672
Get into my office.

566
01:00:58,713 --> 01:01:00,130
Is this your idea of a joke?

567
01:01:04,463 --> 01:01:06,005
Oh, just give me that.

568
01:01:06,755 --> 01:01:08,088
Amazing, isn't it?

569
01:01:20,213 --> 01:01:21,422
Come on!

570
01:01:23,713 --> 01:01:27,755
Okay, sport, we're gonna have
a little game of Chucky says.

571
01:01:28,505 --> 01:01:30,755
Chucky says, "move your ass."

572
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:35,380
Snap out of it!

573
01:01:35,713 --> 01:01:38,213
You act like you never seen
a dead body before!

574
01:01:46,255 --> 01:01:48,213
Andy, come on! Open it.

575
01:01:48,713 --> 01:01:51,047
Andy! Open the door!

576
01:01:51,797 --> 01:01:53,837
Come on! Everybody out!

577
01:02:12,755 --> 01:02:14,380
Inside. Hurry.

578
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:40,005
Stop!

579
01:02:48,422 --> 01:02:50,047
Come on.

580
01:02:50,422 --> 01:02:51,922
Come on.

581
01:02:52,213 --> 01:02:53,547
Come on.

582
01:03:05,755 --> 01:03:07,755
Hey, lady, slow down, will you?

583
01:03:16,047 --> 01:03:18,047
J“ passin' by j"

584
01:03:50,130 --> 01:03:51,630
Say your prayers, Andy.

585
01:03:56,213 --> 01:03:57,380
God damn it!

586
01:04:13,172 --> 01:04:15,047
J“ I first saw you I

587
01:04:15,672 --> 01:04:17,922
Pull over!

588
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:20,922
- What?
- Pull over!

589
01:04:22,088 --> 01:04:23,422
Pull over!

590
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,939
Hey! Just what in the hell
do you think you're doing?

591
01:04:38,963 --> 01:04:40,588
Let me go. Let me go.

592
01:04:41,172 --> 01:04:43,005
What the fuck's wrong with you?

593
01:04:45,797 --> 01:04:46,963
Let go!

594
01:04:47,963 --> 01:04:49,213
Crazy bitch!

595
01:05:47,297 --> 01:05:48,963
We're home.

596
01:05:53,255 --> 01:05:55,380
Close your eyes and count to seven.

597
01:05:55,547 --> 01:05:58,172
When you wake, you'll be in heaven.

598
01:06:03,172 --> 01:06:05,047
This is it, world.

599
01:06:05,213 --> 01:06:06,963
From now on,

600
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:09,505
no more Mr. Good guy.

601
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:19,630
Give me the power, I beg of you.

602
01:07:30,172 --> 01:07:36,422
No!

603
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:42,422
You little shit!

604
01:07:42,588 --> 01:07:44,297
Do you know what you've done?

605
01:07:45,005 --> 01:07:49,255
It's too late! I've spent too much
time in this body.

606
01:07:49,422 --> 01:07:51,922
I'm fucking trapped in here!

607
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:54,588
What the hell?

608
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:57,380
Andy, run.

609
01:08:09,047 --> 01:08:10,672
- Andy.
- Kyle!

610
01:08:11,047 --> 01:08:13,047
Are you okay? Come on.

611
01:08:34,838 --> 01:08:36,047
Shit!

612
01:08:42,422 --> 01:08:43,880
Andy! Hurry up!

613
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:10,547
Let's go. I'll go first.
Stay right behind me.

614
01:09:24,463 --> 01:09:25,672
Come on.

615
01:09:35,172 --> 01:09:36,672
Andy, step on it.

616
01:09:37,088 --> 01:09:39,130
Reach! Give me your hand!

617
01:09:41,463 --> 01:09:42,505
Andy!

618
01:09:42,672 --> 01:09:44,297
Stop yourself. Grab the side.

619
01:09:48,130 --> 01:09:50,547
Andy! Hurry up! He's right behind you.

620
01:09:50,713 --> 01:09:51,755
Little bastard!

621
01:10:03,255 --> 01:10:04,880
Don't look back. Come on. Hurry!

622
01:10:08,463 --> 01:10:10,783
- You can't get away from me!
- Give me your hand!

623
01:10:11,130 --> 01:10:12,797
Reach!

624
01:10:14,172 --> 01:10:17,130
I'm gonna kill you, Andy!

625
01:10:25,297 --> 01:10:28,838
Come on. Go! Go! Go! Run down there.

626
01:10:31,505 --> 01:10:34,713
I'm gonna get you fuckers!

627
01:10:42,672 --> 01:10:44,047
God!

628
01:10:47,547 --> 01:10:49,713
Oh, god!

629
01:11:32,255 --> 01:11:34,255
Come on. Do it!

630
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:43,630
Come on. Give me your hand.

631
01:11:44,963 --> 01:11:46,547
Don't be afraid. Come on.

632
01:11:48,838 --> 01:11:51,213
Closer. Closer so you can grab my hand.

633
01:11:52,463 --> 01:11:54,505
Andy. Now!

634
01:12:05,963 --> 01:12:07,380
Can't open it.

635
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:09,213
How will we get out?

636
01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:11,340
We'll have to find another way.
Give me your hand.

637
01:12:13,130 --> 01:12:15,255
I hate kids.

638
01:12:29,797 --> 01:12:31,213
Terrific.

639
01:15:10,047 --> 01:15:11,172
Duck!

640
01:15:23,797 --> 01:15:25,172
Do it!

641
01:15:29,963 --> 01:15:32,172
Andy, please.

642
01:15:32,338 --> 01:15:34,422
I was only playing.

643
01:15:36,172 --> 01:15:42,130
No, please! Oh, please!

644
01:15:44,922 --> 01:15:46,880
God, it hurts!

645
01:15:52,338 --> 01:15:55,922
No! No! God! No! No! No!

646
01:16:23,505 --> 01:16:24,963
Holy shit.

647
01:16:26,547 --> 01:16:27,630
We did it.

648
01:16:32,255 --> 01:16:33,588
Let's get out of here.

649
01:16:55,130 --> 01:16:56,797
- Let's see. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

650
01:16:56,963 --> 01:16:58,172
What's this?

651
01:16:58,338 --> 01:16:59,547
Thanks for coming after me.

652
01:16:59,713 --> 01:17:02,172
Yeah, well, you owe me one, squirt.

653
01:17:03,380 --> 01:17:04,672
Kyle!

654
01:17:16,130 --> 01:17:19,213
I've got you now, Andy,

655
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:21,963
and you know what I'm gonna do to you?

656
01:17:23,172 --> 01:17:26,588
I'm gonna cut off your legs, too.

657
01:17:40,755 --> 01:17:41,755
Huh?

658
01:18:09,130 --> 01:18:11,338
Kyle! Kyle!

659
01:18:12,338 --> 01:18:15,088
Kyle! Kyle! Kyle, wake up!

660
01:18:17,005 --> 01:18:18,588
Kyle!

661
01:18:19,338 --> 01:18:21,672
Come on. Come on.

662
01:18:42,088 --> 01:18:45,088
Ugh! God. What did you do to him?

663
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:52,463
All right, Andy.

664
01:19:00,922 --> 01:19:02,380
Kyle! Kyle!

665
01:19:10,047 --> 01:19:12,255
Eat this, you son of a bitch.

666
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:20,797
Come on.

667
01:20:08,463 --> 01:20:09,713
Where are we going?

668
01:20:10,088 --> 01:20:11,088
Home.

669
01:20:11,963 --> 01:20:13,088
Where's home?

670
01:20:13,963 --> 01:20:16,338
Andy, I have no idea.
