All right. No, no, no!

You're gonna slide off.

Oh!

- Are you sliding?
- Yes.

17

No, if you're sliding,
I'm going to stop.

I could've sworn
I saw a little girl

<i>(playful gasp)</i>

Hmm...

34
00:02:31,782 --> 00:02:35,047
Maybe my eyes
have deceived me.

35
00:02:35,152 --> 00:02:38,644
I'm invisible, Mommy.

36
00:02:38,756 --> 00:02:40,587
Well, if you're invisible...

Not a clue.

You want Alex?

I love you more

In a little while.

61
00:04:20,424 --> 00:04:22,392
Something you want to talk about?

00:07:01,986 --> 00:07:04,216
I should've seen it coming.

76
00:07:04,321 --> 00:07:06,551
All the signs were there.

77
00:07:06,657 --> 00:07:09,626
The ones closest to you
are the hardest to judge.

78
00:07:09,727 --> 00:07:10,785
No, but I...

79
00:07:10,894 --> 00:07:12,987
I could've prevented it.

80
00:07:13,097 --> 00:07:14,655
David, it's not your fault.

81
00:07:14,765 --> 00:07:18,895
How long have
we known each other?

82
00:07:19,003 --> 00:07:22,029
Trust me when I tell you this.

83
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:24,630
As difficult
as it may seem, you're...

84
00:07:24,742 --> 00:07:27,336
you're gonna have to try
and start over.

85
00:07:27,444 --> 00:07:30,504
We're gonna move.

86
00:07:30,614 --> 00:07:32,047
Upstate.

87
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:33,309
The country.

88
00:07:36,587 --> 00:07:39,249
That's not exactly what
I meant by "starting over. "

89
00:07:41,492 --> 00:07:43,016
What about Emily?

90
00:07:43,127 --> 00:07:45,561
This is a traumatic time for her.

91
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:48,325
I think it's important she stays
here and works through this.

92
00:07:48,432 --> 00:07:49,865
No, here, she's
flooded with memories.

93
00:07:49,967 --> 00:07:52,936
I need to expose her
to a new environment,

94
00:07:53,037 --> 00:07:54,402
new things to do...

95
00:07:54,505 --> 00:07:56,370
She'd be losing another person
she depends on.

96
00:07:58,575 --> 00:08:00,338
It's only an hour away.

97
00:08:00,444 --> 00:08:03,936
And... you're always welcome
to come and see her.

98
00:08:04,048 --> 00:08:08,246
And right now, I need to do
what's right for Emily.

99
00:08:08,352 --> 00:08:10,684
I need to be
a full-time dad.

100
00:08:18,796 --> 00:08:22,732
I have a surprise for you.

101

<i>(simple, sweet "Mockingbird"
melody playing)</i>

102
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:37,403
When I was your age,
my mom gave me one just like that.

103
00:08:37,514 --> 00:08:40,779
And whenever I was feeling sad,

104
00:08:40,884 --> 00:08:44,376
I would open the lid,
and all my sorrows went away.

105
00:08:44,488 --> 00:08:46,285
Do you like it?

106
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,290
<i>(melody continues)</i>

107
00:08:48,392 --> 00:08:49,654

00:09:03,741 --> 00:09:05,800
All right, let's go.

Let's take a look.

122
00:11:18,141 --> 00:11:20,132
MAN:
Right on time.

123
00:11:20,244 --> 00:11:22,303
Dr. Callaway...

124
00:11:22,412 --> 00:11:23,970
Mr. Haskins.

125
00:11:24,081 --> 00:11:25,412
Hello.

126
00:11:25,515 --> 00:11:26,880
This is Sheriff Hafferty.

127
00:11:26,984 --> 00:11:28,042
Sheriff.

128
00:11:28,151 --> 00:11:29,778
He routinely checks
on the houses up here

129
00:11:29,887 --> 00:11:31,514
to make sure things
run smoothly.

130
00:11:31,622 --> 00:11:32,646
I see. Well, this is

131
00:11:32,756 --> 00:11:34,621
my daughter, Emily.
This is Sheriff Hafferty.

132
00:11:34,725 --> 00:11:35,953
Emily.

133
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:38,619
How are you?

134
00:11:38,729 --> 00:11:40,594
This is Mr. Haskins.

135
00:11:40,697 --> 00:11:42,562
He found us the house.

136
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:45,226
Well, hello there, Emily.

137
00:11:45,335 --> 00:11:48,793
Think your dad did a good job
picking the house?

138
00:11:51,108 --> 00:11:53,008
She's still deciding.

139
00:11:55,112 --> 00:11:56,977
Well, she sure is pretty.

140
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,274
Thank you.

141
00:11:58,382 --> 00:11:59,940
HASKINS:
As I mentioned,

142
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,415
Woodland Estates
is mainly

143
00:12:01,518 --> 00:12:02,485
a summer community.

144
00:12:02,586 --> 00:12:05,111
May be a little quiet
up here till then.

145
00:12:05,222 --> 00:12:06,746
Hope that's not a problem.

146
00:12:06,857 --> 00:12:08,688
- Not at all.
- Great.

147
00:12:08,792 --> 00:12:10,316
Let me show you
around the back.

148
00:12:10,427 --> 00:12:11,621
HAFFERTY:
You ever spent

149
00:12:11,728 --> 00:12:13,161
much time in the country?

150
00:12:13,263 --> 00:12:14,457
Not much.

151
00:12:14,564 --> 00:12:16,464
I used to camp
when I was little,

152
00:12:16,566 --> 00:12:18,727
but I was always scared
of the woods.

153
00:12:18,835 --> 00:12:19,859
<i>(chuckles)</i>

154
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,530
Nothing to be scared of
in these woods.

155
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:23,867
Picked a nice spot.

156
00:12:23,974 --> 00:12:25,703
Biggest house on the lake.

157
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:29,040
Sheriff, if you'd like
to do the honors;

158
00:12:29,146 --> 00:12:31,808
let Dr. Callaway
into his new home.

159
00:12:31,915 --> 00:12:33,439
Figure out which key...

160
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:36,781
Did you see where
my daughter went?

161
00:12:36,887 --> 00:12:38,320
Emily!

162
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:42,515
Emily!

163
00:12:43,894 --> 00:12:45,725
Emily!

164
00:12:56,506 --> 00:12:58,667
Honey?

165
00:12:58,775 --> 00:13:00,470
You okay?

166
00:13:03,914 --> 00:13:05,575
Come on.
Let's go back.

167
00:13:05,682 --> 00:13:07,980
Come on.

168

I'd like to go to bed now.

I saw a little girl

come in here.

00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:11,800
since it's the first night
in a new house,

193
00:15:11,908 --> 00:15:15,275
I thought it would be a good
time to start a new diary.

194
00:15:15,378 --> 00:15:16,811
Each day you
can write down

your feelings
and thoughts,

196

you can look back

how much they've changed.

she meant what she said.

And so do I.

206
00:15:53,183 --> 00:15:54,377
You want me to put this

anyone else lived up here.

daughter, Emily.

Emily, say hello to Laura.

Is it because of Elizabeth?

718

Charlie needs to understand
something, honey.

719

Elizabeth is not trying
to take Mommy's place.

Does he understand that?

Hi.

01:00:02,558 --> 01:00:05,152
Hello. David.

839
01:00:05,261 --> 01:00:07,559
I thought I'd return the favor.

840
01:00:07,663 --> 01:00:11,030
Oh, thank you.

You must think
we're pretty crazy

It's, um...

It's hard to find the right

No, you have nothing

Listen to me.
Please, I can help you.

if we talked for a moment?

I brought you some daisies.

I wasn't sure which one
was your favorite color,

got all kinds.

about what happened
the other night.

I want you to know
that I'm not trying

to come between
you and your dad.

we could start over?

she came up here to see you.

she might have crashed

I seen the tire tracks
leading down the hill.

So, she must have
at least stopped by.

01:08:56,525 --> 01:08:58,516
Well, maybe she
forgot something,

967

I don't know,
but, uh...
