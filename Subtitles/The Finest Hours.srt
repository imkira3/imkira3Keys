2
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,220
Bernie, seriously... this is where
they asked us to meet?

3
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,380
Yeah. What do you mean?

4
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,940
Oh, I think I see her.

5
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,020
Where?

6
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,804
Oh, that's gotta be her.

7
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,380
So, what are we gonna do?

8
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,540
Are we gonna grab a milkshake, Bernie?

9
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,860
Is that why we're here?

10
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,008
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, I guess.

11
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,767
All right. You're gonna
owe me big for this.

12
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,370
So...

13
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,460
You think I should have worn
the other shirt?

14
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,562
You look nice.

15
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,300
I don't know, Gus. Maybe, she...

16
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,050
What if she don't like
the look of me or something?

17
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,089
Bernie. Come on.

18
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,282
Are you serious? What about her?

19
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,409
Aren't you dying to see
what she looks like?

20
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,860
She could be a dog.

21
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,180
No, she isn't a dog.

22
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,660
She could be.

23
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,180
I already know what
she looks like in my head.

24
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,486
She ain't a dog.

25
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,601
So, uh...

26
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,321
You been talking to her for
weeks on the phone, right?

27
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,660
- Yeah.
- Right?

28
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,761
Yeah.

29
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,860
She likes you from talking to you, Bernie.

30
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,900
And I don't think you gotta worry
about her getting a good look at ya.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,446
That ain't never been your problem.

32
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,565
Let's go.

33
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,924
Come on.

34
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,243
Should have worn the other shirt.

35
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,220
I'm the one taking a risk.

36
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,540
Doubling with some girl
I ain't never even spoke to...

37
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,860
let alone seen!

38
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,980
I don't know why this Miriam girl...

39
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,367
says it's gotta be a double date, anyway.

40
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,940
Maybe she's not sure about me yet.

41
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,500
How can anybody
not be sure about you, Bernie?

42
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,940
Yeah. Thanks, Gus.

43
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,740
Yeah, hey, don't tell none of the guys
down at the station about this.

44
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,922
It's not like you've
never been on a date before.

45
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,251
- All set there?
- Uh...

46
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,010
Excuse me.

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,081
Are you Miriam?

48
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,201
No.

49
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,245
I'm her friend.

50
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,041
She's, uh...

51
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,327
Hi. How you doin'? I'm Gus.

52
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,681
- Catherine.
- It's nice to meet you.

53
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,006
Okay. We'll talk later.

54
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,484
Bye.

55
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,801
Hi.

56
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,201
Wait.

57
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,890
You are Bernie Webber, right?

58
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,411
Uh, yeah.

59
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,521
Yeah, I'm Bernie.

60
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,409
Hey, you two, let's go grab a drink.

61
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,646
Yeah.

62
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,940
You wanna go?

63
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,460
Sure.

64
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,300
How you doin'? I'm Gus.

65
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,006
You know, for a minute there...

66
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,848
I thought it was Smokey the Bear
makin' a call in that booth.

67
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,850
'Cause of your jacket.

68
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,323
Oh.

69
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,180
Bernie...

70
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,780
Miriam's never been on a boat.
She's scared of the water.

71
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,860
Has she never?

72
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,460
I told her I don't know how she's
gonna date a guy in the Coast Guard.

73
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,940
I'm not scared. I live on the Cape.

74
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,580
Don't worry, Miriam. You know, we, uh...

75
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,300
We all get scared out there.

76
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,209
I'm not afraid of the water, Bernie.

77
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,050
It scares me at night, that's all.

78
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,601
You can't see what's underneath.

79
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,001
Just more water.

80
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,340
You know, I get funnier
as the night goes on.

81
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,523
So, why, uh... Why didn't you
wanna meet me for a date?

82
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,409
Why'd you... Why'd you wait so long?

83
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,202
I didn't know if you'd be a...

84
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,321
If I'd what?

85
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,322
- You know.
- No.

86
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,540
You're so handsome...

87
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,961
I just didn't know
if you'd be attracted to me.

88
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,580
Oh, God, no, Miriam.

89
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,409
You're exactly how I pictured you.

90
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,020
Yeah?

91
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,610
Oh, yeah.

92
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,401
Better.

93
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,008
You know... My brother, uh...

94
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,447
He always says that, "When
you know, you just know."

95
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,060
Which one?

96
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,083
Uh, all of it.
I guess, you know, everything.

97
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,804
No. I mean, which brother?

98
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,802
Oh. Ay...

99
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,402
Uh, Paul. My brother, Paul.

100
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,860
He's the one who fought
over in Germany, right?

101
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,961
In Germany, yeah.

102
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,700
He's the oldest. Father's favorite.

103
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,245
All three of my brothers
went over to the war.

104
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,361
He's your father's what?

105
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,280
Hey.

106
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,122
We should get Miriam
out on a boat tonight.

107
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,730
What do you say, Bernie, hmm?

108
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,767
We take out the dory.

109
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,500
It'll be fantastic.

110
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,700
You know we can't do that, Gus.

111
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,020
We could get in trouble.

112
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,167
Come on, Bernie. It'll be fun.

113
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,486
Rules are rules.

114
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,001
No. We don't gotta row out far.

115
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,845
Just so this sweet girl can say
she's been on a boat, that's it.

116
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,220
A rowboat? No.

117
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,368
No.

118
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,131
No, no. Small boats that...

119
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,844
How about one of those bigger
boats? Tied up to the dock?

120
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,691
If Bernie's with me, I'll do it.

121
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,604
Oh, a fishing boat?

122
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,260
Those fishermen don't want us around,
unless we're pullin' them in.

123
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,580
They think they own the goddamn water.

124
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,580
They're not very nice.

125
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,140
Come on. Don't be such a fathead, Miriam.

126
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,220
Yeah.

127
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,722
Let's go out on the dory.
What's there to be afraid of?

128
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,925
What's underneath, right?

129
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,820
Hey there, Mr. Stello. How's it goin'?

130
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,207
- Hey, Bernie.
- Mr. Ryder.

131
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,690
Hey, so you see that girl
sitting over there?

132
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,940
The one with the coat
looks like a bear, Bernie?

133
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,340
- Yeah.
- Can't miss her.

134
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,460
I said the same thing myself.
Funny you should say that.

135
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,060
Looks like Smokey, right? Smokey the Bear.

136
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,620
I don't know no Smokey, Bernie.

137
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,245
Oh, it's just a cartoon.

138
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,260
Anyway, Mr. Stello, she thinks
she's scared of going out on a boat.

139
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,740
And I don't think
we should row out on a dory.

140
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,764
I don't want her gettin' sick
on that nice, big coat.

141
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,900
So, I was wondering if...

142
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,446
So, you wanna take her on
the Anna G round the harbor?

143
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,100
Yeah.

144
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,580
Can't row out on that dory

145
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,420
even if ya wanted, right, Bernie?

146
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,921
- Carl, stop.
- Year anniversary's coming.

147
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,049
My sister's now livin' in my house.

148
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,460
How's it going with you, Bernie?

149
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,484
That's enough, Carl. He did all he could.

150
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,540
I am sorry, Mr. Nickerson.

151
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,740
I didn't mean to upset you.

152
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,565
Just wanted to ask Mr. Stello
about borrowing a boat.

153
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,526
Got you. I got you.

154
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,171
This is a boat.

155
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,730
Give me your hands.

156
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,891
It's okay.

157
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,940
<i>Now the hacienda's dark</i>

158
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,486
<i>The town is sleeping</i>

159
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,460
<i>Now the time has come to part</i>

160
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,530
<i>The time for weeping</i>

161
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,725
<i>Vaya con dios, my darling</i>

162
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,700
Just, uh...

163
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,300
- Just follow my arms, okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

164
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,164
Stay with me.

165
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,260
- It's all about the rhythm.
- Mmm-hmm.

166
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,044
Okay? So it's, uh... So it's, uh...

167
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,820
Here we go.

168
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,900
One, two, three.

169
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,420
Right, left, right.

170
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,300
One, two, three.

171
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,687
One, two, three. One...

172
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,660
I can't one, two, three to this.

173
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,060
- Let's just sit down, Bernie.
- No, sweetheart.

174
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:17,060
Look, all you gotta do is you
gotta relax and be patient...

175
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,100
and settle in my hand.

176
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,020
Hey, look, just... Here...

177
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,780
settle in my hand. You feel that?

178
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,860
Mmm.

179
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,940
Just listen to the music, right?

180
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,726
And... One, two, three.

181
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,860
One, two, three. Right, left, right.

182
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,860
Right, left, right.

183
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,121
You're doing great.

184
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,011
<i>Now the dawn is breaking through</i>

185
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,726
<i>A gray tomorrow</i>

186
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,087
<i>But the memories we share
Are there to borrow</i>

187
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,940
<i>Vaya con dios, my darling</i>

188
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,405
Will you marry me?

189
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,161
What?

190
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,448
Will you marry me?

191
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,445
Uh...

192
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,761
No.

193
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:30,884
<i>Vaya con dios, my darling</i>

194
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,564
<i>Vaya con dios...</i>

195
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,364
Miriam, hold on!

196
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,860
It's cold, sweetheart.

197
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,291
Don't you wanna go back inside?

198
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,605
The band's not through.

199
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,967
It's cold. Do you feel that?
There's a storm comin'.

200
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,007
Okay.

201
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,060
Okay, what?

202
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,340
Okay, let's get married.

203
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,340
I just... I don't wanna...

204
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,646
Wanna what?

205
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,900
Well, it's only been a few months
and it's still winter, after all.

206
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,940
And, look, there's a storm comin'.

207
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,940
It's just like this one
that come through last year.

208
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,246
What does that...

209
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,124
I heard it's gonna miss us.

210
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,161
Yeah, but maybe not. You never know.

211
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,290
You never know.

212
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,082
Some people, they're
just not cut out for this.

213
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,044
Sometimes you go out
and you don't come back.

214
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,929
Are you talking about the storm
or marriage, Bernie?

215
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,527
I think I'm talking about
the storm, right?

216
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,689
You're scared of a storm?

217
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,326
No.

218
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,921
I don't want to disappoint nobody.

219
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,207
And...

220
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,286
I don't wanna lose you. I love you.

221
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,767
So...

222
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,642
Yeah, let's get married.

223
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,881
You sure?

224
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,365
Oh, yeah.

225
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,140
When?

226
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,340
You want me to pick a date? No!

227
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,601
When do you wanna get married?

228
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,340
April 16th.

229
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,169
Okay.

230
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,130
Okay. April 16th it is.

231
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,084
But, uh, I gotta ask
permission from Cluff first.

232
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,605
You gotta ask permission?

233
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,300
Yeah, it's from my commanding officer.

234
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,620
It's Coast Guard regulation.

235
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,961
But I promise I'll ask him tomorrow.

236
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,484
Okay, Bernie.

237
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,045
Let's get you home.

238
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,844
Man, you can dance.

239
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,686
Ah, look at that. It's already
starting to snow. Hmm?

240
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,528
Can you hear me
over this hummin', Captain?

241
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,524
That fracture they welded last month
is not gonna hold in these seas, Cap.

242
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,808
Takes a bad jolt,
she could fracture again.

243
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,685
I don't have to go on deck, Cap.

244
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,540
I can hear it from right down here.

245
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,005
That weld is really hummin'.

246
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,900
It's hummin', sir.
The weld is, uh... Hummin'.

247
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,083
Uh, I'd like to take it down
to three knots, please.

248
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,885
Uh...

249
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,290
If we don't slow her down, Captain,
we might not have a, uh...

250
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,766
A position to hold.

251
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,646
Uh, no problem, Cap.

252
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,321
Uh, holdin' at seven knots.
Thank you, sir.

253
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,340
Hey, Pop?

254
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,521
I hear it.

255
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,300
You wanna go up on deck?

256
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,060
Have a look at those crack arrestors
holdin' that weld together?

257
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,340
Might as well go be get a hat, Popo.

258
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,566
What did he say?

259
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,260
Uh, he says he would like you to
consider taking a hat with you, as well.

260
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,321
Get some sleep.

261
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,860
<i>For the people all said sit down</i>

262
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,325
<i>Sit down, you're rockin' the boat</i>

263
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,811
Hey, Pops!

264
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,340
What do you know about this weather?

265
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,420
It's killin' me and young Eldon here.

266
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,490
Tiny, sure it's the weather?
Maybe it's your singing.

267
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,563
<i>For the people all said sit down</i>

268
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,420
<i>Sit down, you're rockin' the boat</i>

269
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,567
Come on.

270
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,489
<i>The people all said sit down</i>

271
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,806
<i>Sit down, you're rockin' the boat</i>

272
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,925
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

273
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,285
Ah, it's gonna get worse.

274
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,086
Sybert!

275
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,740
I didn't make it topside.

276
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,524
That weld can't hold in these seas.

277
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,250
You gotta slow her down.

278
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,049
I'm calling the captain back.

279
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,971
It's coming in!

280
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,165
- You okay, Pops?
- Yeah.

281
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,246
Go up!

282
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,340
We've got a hull fracture
in the engine room!

283
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,300
All hands muster mattresses...

284
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,500
blankets, whatever you can
get your hands on!

285
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,005
Tchuda.

286
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,567
Yeah, boy?

287
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,220
I can't get anyone on the bridge.

288
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,420
I need you to go up and tell the captain
we got an 18-foot fracture in our hull.

289
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,567
Tell him these pumps
are holding for now...

290
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,020
but we don't put her into
port, we're gonna wreck.

291
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,420
Captain don't understand me, Bouloo.

292
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,564
I know he can't understand you
but he doesn't listen to anyone, anyway.

293
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,531
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

294
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,241
- Cold out there?
- Yeah.

295
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,180
You still tryin' to fix that darn thing?

296
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,361
Yeah.

297
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,409
Oh, come on. Fitzy, it's useless.

298
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,380
Let the guy who fixes it come fix it.

299
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,084
I would if he would show up.

300
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,060
What's this on the radio,
ship breaking up?

301
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,321
That's the Fort Mercer.

302
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,940
Fort Mercer?

303
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,260
She's a big lady. She's a T2 tanker.

304
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,647
Started radioin' a couple hours ago.

305
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,820
Apparently she's got
a big crack in her hull.

306
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,740
It's spillin' oil all over the place.

307
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,700
She's, uh, about 20 miles east
off of Nantucket.

308
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,660
It sounds like Boston and Nantucket
are sendin' out their entire fleet, huh?

309
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,000
We could be next.

310
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,860
They're saying gale force winds
50 to 60 miles per hour.

311
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,689
Yeah. Yeah.

312
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,500
...waves at 50 feet. Over.

313
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,620
It's gonna be a mess.

314
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,211
Oh, uh, Bernie, Bernie.

315
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,842
Uh, Miriam called for you.

316
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,526
Yeah.

317
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,047
Good luck, pal.

318
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,929
- Yeah.
- Mr. Cluff?

319
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,249
It's me, Bernie, sir.

320
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,060
Webber. Pick yourself a crew.

321
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,690
Go out there, help them fishermen
secure their boats to the pier.

322
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,406
Oh. Uh, yes, sir.

323
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,322
Sir, I need to ask you a question.

324
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,441
Uh...

325
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,140
I need permission about a girl, you know?

326
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,940
Permission? Permission... For a girl?

327
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,420
Mr. Cluff, it's working.

328
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,567
Yes, sir.

329
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,841
Not now, Webber.

330
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,300
But, sir. It's
not just "some girl," sir...

331
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,765
Not now, Webber.

332
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,660
We're back up.

333
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,140
Cluster here's the Mercer rescue, right?

334
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,060
And this here other pip,
two miles from here.

335
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,288
We must still be gettin' phantom echoes.

336
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,980
How we supposed to tell
where anything is out there?

337
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,940
When's that technician
comin', Fitzpatrick?

338
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,580
And where the hell's Chief Bangs?

339
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,681
Uh...

340
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,500
It's Fitzgerald, sir.

341
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,046
Chief Bangs is in the mess hall, sir.

342
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,765
You makin' fun of my accent
'cause I'm not from around here?

343
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,888
No, Mr. Cluff.

344
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,260
Why are you still standing here, Webber?

345
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,340
Sir, but...

346
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,283
Take Livesey here with you,
go tie up them fishin' boats.

347
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,700
Yes, sir.

348
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,802
You want me to go with Webber, sir?

349
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,684
Secure fishing boats?

350
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,130
You didn't hear me, Livesey?
Uh, yeah, you with Webber.

351
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,641
Sorry, Richie. His orders, you know.

352
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,325
That's enough time,
what do you think, huh?

353
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,660
We're takin' on water, we
gotta launch them lifeboats.

354
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,220
Why you gotta be such a jackass, Brown?

355
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,620
Least we can do, pray for
the captain, Chief Collagen...

356
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,980
Rest of them men. All good men.

357
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,809
Hey, ain't we good men, Quirey?

358
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,380
Ah, don't get me wrong.

359
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,051
Prayin's great, but it ain't everything.

360
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,850
We need to actually do somethin'.

361
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,371
Sybert.

362
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,126
A word.

363
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,890
That hothead Brown, he wants
to launch the lifeboats.

364
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,460
The lifeboats?

365
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,700
Quirey, he wants to do nothin'.

366
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,729
Now, between them, the two of them
are getting the men worked up.

367
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,403
Now, I figure that you know
the boat better than anybody.

368
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,620
You're practically married to it.

369
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,620
So, I think they'll listen to ya.

370
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,801
Listen to me?

371
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,929
Pop, those men don't like me.

372
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,128
Nobody on the ship likes me
but you and Tchuda.

373
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,931
They might not like you, but
they'll know to listen to ya.

374
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,569
We don't know if the captain
got off an S.O.S.

375
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,682
Radio room's gone. We can't call nobody!

376
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,340
It's just Garcia over there
with a little shortwave...

377
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,601
tryin' to pick up chatter.

378
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,888
I mean, as far as we know
nobody even knows we're out here.

379
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,126
Now I'm saying we launch them lifeboats now
and we get off this ship while we can.

380
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,402
How are you gonna get 'em down
in the water in this storm?

381
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,762
It can't be done,
those boats are too small.

382
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,251
It's suicide, Brown.

383
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,740
You can't do this, you can't do that.

384
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,140
What do you want us to do, Quirey?

385
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,480
Just sit up here and do nothin'?

386
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,980
That's it, no officers, no orders.

387
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,300
Every man for himself.

388
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,765
That ain't the way, Brown.

389
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,369
That never did nothing for nobody.

390
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,500
Now, the ship's split...

391
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,620
at the bulkheads separating
tanks eight and nine.

392
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,803
Mr. Sybert says that the other
tanks aren't fractured...

393
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,570
So the air in the ballast
tanks should keep us afloat.

394
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,620
But Mr. Sybert also says that...

395
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,848
Mr. Sybert says this,
Mr. Sybert says that.

396
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,340
He's a big boy.

397
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,965
Let him say it himself. He's right here.

398
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,407
Go ahead.

399
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,460
Uh...

400
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,100
We're sinking.

401
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,248
Yeah, but the whistle works.

402
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,980
So, we should keep blowing that.

403
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,048
Maybe somebody'll hear it.

404
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,060
I don't know,
but we're definitely sinking.

405
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,721
The crack in the engine room
is takin' on too much water.

406
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,220
Pumps can't keep up.

407
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,100
If the water reaches the
air-intake in the engine...

408
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,100
we're going to, uh, lose all the power.

409
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,580
And if we lose all the power,
we lose the pumps.

410
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,170
When we lose the pumps...

411
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,810
She's gonna drop pretty quick.

412
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,330
How long have we got before that happens?

413
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,048
Four, maybe five hours.

414
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,884
We need to buy ourselves some time.

415
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,689
So somebody can find us.

416
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,211
If anybody's even lookin'.

417
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:38,601
Even if they do know we're here
those seas are big enough.

418
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,762
I mean, it ripped this thing in half.

419
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,684
How the hell are they gonna get out?

420
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,730
That's why I'm sayin' we gotta
launch some lifeboats.

421
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,500
Our luck's runnin' out.

422
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,965
I don't believe in luck, Brown.

423
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,500
Put those lifeboats out in those seas...

424
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,060
they won't last 12 seconds.

425
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,060
You and Quirey both,
you just wanna sit around and do nothin'.

426
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,245
You got a better idea, Sybert,
or you just go back, hide down below?

427
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,700
We're gonna run her aground.

428
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,940
- Huh?
- Do what?

429
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,202
You wanna run her aground, Sybert?

430
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,887
Even if you could with
half a ship, why would you?

431
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,900
She'd break apart,
dump us all out in that sea.

432
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,180
It's our only choice.

433
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,408
We're gonna find a soft shoal,
and we'll lay her up.

434
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,766
We'll slow the water that's coming in.

435
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,780
We'll stay in the same spot.
We'll blow the whistle.

436
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,891
We'll give whoever's coming
to look for us a chance to find us.

437
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,571
You're gonna steer a ship
without hydraulics?

438
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,660
That's your plan? How's that gonna work?

439
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,500
I'm gonna build a manual tiller.

440
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,460
Hey, Sybert, why should
we even listen to you?

441
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,340
The only thing you ever cared
about was this ship.

442
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,420
Man, I'll tell you what.

443
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,220
You two make a cute couple
at the bottom of the ocean.

444
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,890
Me, I'm gonna get on a lifeboat.

445
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,286
Look.

446
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,449
We'll insert a steel beam
into the steering quadrant.

447
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,401
We'll put pulleys
on the end of it for leverage.

448
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,728
And we'll move her manually.

449
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,121
Excuse me. Excuse me.

450
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,130
I think I got the radio working.

451
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,020
Bearing 83 degrees true...

452
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,168
27 miles from Pollock Rip Light.

453
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,288
About 20 miles east of Nantucket...

454
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,020
"East of Nantucket"?
That ain't the Pendleton.

455
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,220
Fort Mercer's emergency condition...

456
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,820
Fort Mercer. That's another T2.

457
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:28,447
Another tanker split in two besides us.

458
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,206
But if everyone's gonna
help them, who's gonna...

459
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,203
Who's gonna come for us?

460
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,100
How you feelin'?

461
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,486
- You all right?
- Mmm.

462
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,700
Did you, uh, ask Cluff, yet?

463
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,040
No.

464
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,300
Why don't you ask him?

465
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,900
- Webber!
- What's wrong with you?

466
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,420
- Webber!
- What?

467
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,000
You ask him yet? You ask Cluff?

468
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,700
I told you not to tell nobody.

469
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,723
I'm sorry, I'm not havin' a very good day.

470
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,762
I know you're not feeling well...

471
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,100
You know, Webber, you don't
need permission to get married.

472
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,780
No, actually, you do, Chief.

473
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,325
Unless you're underage.

474
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,686
Thanks, Chief, just following regulations.

475
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,700
Let's go get suited up.

476
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,820
Uh, it's not regulation, Webber.

477
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,161
It's just a formality, like a courtesy.

478
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,847
And, hey, did I hear right,
that she asked you?

479
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,460
Following orders, right, Webber?

480
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,020
Yeah. Yeah, she asked me, Chief.

481
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,565
Wow.

482
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,340
Wow. You, uh, sure you got
your pants on, Webber...

483
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,900
or is she wearin' 'em?

484
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,809
Sounds like this girl cut off your...

485
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,361
What, Webber? What? Huh?

486
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,687
Don't you got boats to tie up?

487
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,041
She's my fiancée, sir.

488
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,924
Who asked you...

489
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,380
to be married.

490
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,020
Come on, Richie, let's go.

491
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,770
One moment.

492
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,361
Uh-huh, sure.

493
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,928
I'm sorry, sir. Please speak up.

494
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,180
This line is bad, ma'am.

495
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,406
I'll try and reconnect it to you.

496
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,683
Please, sir. The lines are down.

497
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,207
Bernie? How are you? How's work?

498
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,163
Yeah, it's been one
of those days, you know.

499
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,281
But how are you?

500
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,420
Hey, you're not the radar
technician, are you?

501
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,860
Uh, no.

502
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,220
I was ordered to hole up here
till the storm passes.

503
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,561
Catch a ride back out to my lightship.

504
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,001
Um, you can go wait in
the mess hall, if you want to.

505
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,925
Now is not a good time, you know.

506
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,580
Um, I gotta get ready to go
down to the pier, tie up some boats. So...

507
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,860
I wish you were here with me.

508
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,420
I'm hearin' all sorts of things
about a ship breakin' up, and I...

509
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,567
- Oh.
- Hello?

510
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,087
What, you okay?

511
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,563
Yeah, we just lost our lights.

512
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,060
You better go find 'em, then.

513
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,700
Nantucket's dispatched
their 36-footer to the Mercer.

514
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,020
We got orders to do the same.

515
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,980
You asked Cluff yet? That's him, right?

516
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,923
Not yet, sweet... Uh...

517
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,060
I'll explain later.

518
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,660
- I... I gotta go.
- Okay.

519
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,841
I love you.

520
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,200
I love you, too.

521
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,805
Yeah, bye.

522
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,260
The best part of it is
she had no idea who I was.

523
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,361
Bangs?

524
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,644
Pick yourself a crew
take the 36500 out of Old Harbor.

525
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,500
Proceed to the Fort Mercer...

526
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,100
20 miles east of here
off Nantucket, you hear?

527
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,009
Uh, whoa, I don't believe we'd get
over the bar in this weather, Mr. Cluff.

528
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,805
We're better off takin'
the 36383 out of Stage Harbor.

529
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,125
That would take longer, right?

530
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,886
Not much.

531
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,820
What do you think, Webber?

532
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,020
You're a bosun mate, too.

533
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,485
You know what it's like out there.

534
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,020
Yeah, look. No one's gettin' over
the bar in this weather, Mr. Cluff.

535
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,121
Nobody.

536
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,486
It's a suicide mission.

537
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,763
We should take the 36383
out of Stage Harbor.

538
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,140
It'll take longer, sure.

539
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,322
At least we'll be able to get out.

540
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,100
Godspeed, Chief.

541
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,780
Webber, take Gouthro and
Livesey down to the fish pier.

542
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,006
Yes, sir.

543
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,100
Don't get me sick, Gus.

544
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,645
You shouldn't even be out here.

545
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,820
Why you always raggin' on us, Richie?

546
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,180
Don't take it out on us
'cause you couldn't go out with Bangs.

547
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,300
At least he'll get out.

548
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,140
Screw you. That were a year ago.

549
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,446
Screw you.

550
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,085
No one could have
got over the bar that day.

551
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,660
Bangs coulda.

552
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,700
Oh, really, Richie.

553
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,962
He's not trying to get
across the bar today.

554
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,660
No, he's taking the 36383...

555
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,140
right out from the nice,
protected bay side.

556
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,765
Ah.

557
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,410
Bernie, it doesn't matter
what Richie here thinks...

558
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,528
or Bangs or Carl Nickerson or nobody.

559
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,329
Nobody could have got out
to save the men on the Landry

560
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,770
Sometimes, you know...

561
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,563
Sometimes men die, Bernie.

562
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,286
All right. Here we go.

563
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,140
All right, hang on.

564
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,651
Easy, now. Easy, fellas.

565
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,047
- I got it.
- Okay, up, up, up!

566
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,740
One...

567
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,841
Two.

568
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,641
All together now.

569
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,361
Three!

570
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,400
Tie it down, boys. I got it.

571
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,300
All right. Now we've got a tiller.

572
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,243
We're gonna drive her up on the shoal.

573
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,340
Uh-uh. Brown and them others, they're
getting ready to launch them lifeboats.

574
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,488
They think it's their best hope.

575
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,806
Oh, Pop.

576
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,500
We need every guy we got.

577
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,251
Well, they're gonna take them lifeboats.

578
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,780
What are you tryin' to do, Sybert?

579
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,041
Get off him!

580
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,610
You come up here tryin' to kill us?

581
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,180
Are you trying to kill us?

582
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,460
Back off him.

583
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,900
Get up!

584
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,340
You're out of your mind!

585
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,100
Brown, he just saved your life, okay?

586
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,441
The boat's in pieces. It's gone!

587
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,840
Enough!

588
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,800
That boat is too small for these seas.

589
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,500
And this ship will be sunk by nightfall.

590
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,931
Now, every fella here wants to live...

591
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:16,130
and the only way that happens
is if we run her aground!

592
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,420
We gotta set up a watch
and look out for a shoal.

593
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,380
I need four men working the pulleys
on the emergency tiller.

594
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,340
I need four men manning
the pumps, aft to steering...

595
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,331
and the rest of you run a bucket line
topside down below...

596
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,488
...communicate with the engine room.

597
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,244
And somebody...

598
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,020
keep blowing that whistle.

599
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,930
You heard him, boys! Now move it! Come on!

600
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,081
Sounds like you're the man now, Sybert.

601
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,490
I hope you didn't just kill us all.

602
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,325
I saw a ship driftin'.

603
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,040
Heard it whistle.

604
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,140
A distress signal. 45 minutes ago, Bernie.

605
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,765
From my house.

606
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,441
Uh...

607
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,044
With the wind blowin' south,
and those currents...

608
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,285
I guess that'd put her close to here
about now comin' up over the bar.

609
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,002
Can't be part of the Mercer, Bernie.

610
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,820
She's off Nantucket,
40 miles southeast of here.

611
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,287
Means she would have
drifted northwest then, right?

612
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,970
I know what I heard.

613
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,005
Know what I saw.

614
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,771
Well, okay, then, uh...

615
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,491
How about we go back to the station
see if we can get to the bottom of it?

616
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,449
Just got off the phone with Boston.

617
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,580
They diverted a plane from the Mercer...

618
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,523
and it sighted the stern
of the tanker Pendleton...

619
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,529
five miles east of here.

620
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,540
Oh, my God.

621
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,460
Two tankers broken in half in one day.

622
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,891
That's gotta be some kind of record.

623
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,780
Boston and Nantucket have dispatched
all their boats to the Mercer.

624
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,008
They can't make it here in this weather.

625
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,006
Webber.

626
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,380
Pick yourself a crew.

627
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,131
Take that 36500 out
and you go over the bar...

628
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,210
and you find the stern of
the Pendleton. You hear?

629
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,762
Uh... Yes, sir.

630
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,900
Um...

631
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,044
You fellas want to get warmed up,
get some coffee?

632
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,127
Bernie.

633
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,681
Yeah.

634
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,420
Uh...

635
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,646
What?

636
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,044
What Carl's trying to say...

637
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,761
This isn't about the Landry

638
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,769
Oh, sure it is.

639
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,900
Richie.

640
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,968
Eight men died that night.

641
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:26,488
You and Gus and Masachi
couldn't even get out.

642
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,727
What makes you think you can do it now?

643
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,322
You know the bar on this
kind of day, right, Bernie?

644
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,441
Yeah.

645
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,580
That man in there
don't know what he's doin'.

646
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,886
He's sending you out to die.

647
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,380
You can't make it over Chatham
bar on a day like this.

648
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,404
Can't stay afloat for long
on half a ship neither.

649
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,689
Mr. Stello, in the Coast Guard
they say, you gotta go out.

650
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,609
But they don't say you gotta come back in.

651
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,220
That's regulation, you know.

652
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,443
Bernie, better you get lost
afore you get too far out, then.

653
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,608
Oh, don't worry about me, Mr. Ryder.

654
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,940
I can't get lost out there.

655
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,690
I know those waters pretty good.

656
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,140
How could I get lost?

657
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,540
No, no, no, no, Bernie.
What Dave's trying to say...

658
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,888
you should just motor around the harbor
say you tried to get out and couldn't.

659
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,521
You know?

660
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,607
Thank you, Mr. Ryder. Thank you.

661
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:27,601
But, Mr. Stello, I'm gonna do
my best to get out there.

662
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,161
I don't know if I will, but I'm gonna try.

663
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,807
Okay.

664
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,881
I guess Richie's in.

665
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,881
Who else?

666
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,042
Uh, I don't know, Gus.
You can hardly lift your head.

667
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,620
Who else you gonna take, Bernie?

668
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,820
Fitz is the only other engineman left.

669
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:18,603
And he's only third class
and he don't got the experience.

670
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,127
I'll... I'll go.

671
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,403
Yeah, I can do the job.

672
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,220
I mean, I can do it. You can't go.

673
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,560
You're sick as a dog, Gus.

674
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,766
He's right, Gus.

675
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,845
One more.

676
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,926
Someone has to go out there
and save those guys, right?

677
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,009
That's why I signed up.
Guess now's my chance.

678
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,526
Seaman Ervin Maske, Stonehorse lightship.

679
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,045
Pumps aren't keepin' up.

680
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,366
Three more feet...

681
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,660
till we lose the engines.

682
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,683
Can you lock that boiler on full?

683
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,660
You crazy to think
you can steer her broken...

684
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,842
with a couple of ropes
and a hand-made tiller, boy.

685
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,247
You got a better idea? I'm all ears.

686
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,683
There! A shoal about a mile distance!

687
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,100
We can make that!

688
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,020
Rudder, 15 degrees to port!

689
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,088
Half-speed if we want to hit it head on!

690
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:44,289
Gotta make a turn 80 degrees
on the compass to 310!

691
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,780
Rudder, 15 degrees port! Half-speed!

692
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,565
80 degrees to 310 on compass!

693
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:57,202
15 degrees port! Half-speed!
80 degrees to 310 on compass!

694
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,340
Rudder, 15 degrees port! Half-speed!

695
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,090
80 degrees to 310 on the compass!

696
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,180
Rudder, 15 degrees port! Half-speed!

697
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,441
80 degrees to 310 on compass!

698
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,500
Rudder, 15 degrees port! Half-speed!

699
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,329
80 degrees to 310 on compass!

700
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:10,060
Rudder, 15 degrees port! Half-speed!

701
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,571
80 degrees to 310 on the compass!

702
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,500
Rudder, 15 degrees port! Half-speed!

703
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,921
80 degrees to 310 on compass!

704
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,969
Rudder, 15 degrees port. Half-speed.

705
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,650
80 degrees to 310 on compass.

706
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,364
Thank you, Eldon.

707
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,287
All right! You guys! Now, pull!

708
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,244
Pull, pull, pull! Come on!

709
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:18,245
Please tell me we're takin' that boat
to a bigger boat.

710
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,620
You ever been on a rescue mission before?

711
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:20,700
No.

712
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,529
Mostly I just chip paint.

713
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,482
Sometimes I cook for the boys.

714
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,500
Great.

715
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,540
All right, you, uh, take the glory hole.

716
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,369
Maske. Ervin Maske.

717
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,540
Ervin, yeah.

718
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,849
Uh, Richie, drop
the mooring line when you can.

719
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,762
Last known position
of the Pendleton is here.

720
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,900
So, I figure once we cross the bar...

721
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,260
I reckon with the currents
she'll have drifted about here.

722
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,885
That's six miles from us.

723
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,620
So, you think Bernie can get
us out past the bar in this?

724
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,007
I've never seen anything like it.

725
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:13,042
Yeah, I mean, he's just gotta be sure
that he doesn't pitchpole us, that's all.

726
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,361
Huh?

727
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:17,841
The power of the waves on that bar
they can pick you up...

728
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:21,020
they can turn you end for end
over and over again.

729
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,406
There's no way to survive that.

730
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,045
That's pitchpoling.

731
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,780
Hey, Fitz, are we good?

732
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,700
All right, give it a shot!

733
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:53,966
Free the lines!

734
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:55,721
Lines freed!

735
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,609
Did Bernie go out, Gus?

736
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,449
Miriam, what are you doing here?

737
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:41,801
Did he?

738
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,326
Yeah, Cluff sent him.

739
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,566
I wanna talk to him.

740
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,049
- Who?
- Cluff.

741
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,884
Your commanding officer. Where is he?

742
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,100
I wanna find out where Bernie is.

743
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,804
I'm worried about him.

744
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,166
We're supposed to get married.

745
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,846
Miriam, this isn't what
any of the other girls do.

746
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,245
Or wives.

747
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,684
They don't come in here,
and they don't do this.

748
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,607
So?

749
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,444
If you want, I guess you can wait in here.

750
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,604
Listen to what's going on.

751
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,761
Sit down.

752
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:13,922
Tide's risin'.
Gonna work us off that shoal.

753
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,241
We need to hit it hard.

754
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:16,970
Yeah, there's no other way.

755
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:18,767
Wave!

756
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,531
You feel that? She's drifting.

757
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:44,321
Must have lost the tiller.

758
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,603
We gotta slow her headway
or we're gonna miss that shoal for good.

759
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,020
Close the governor valves,
cut the propulsion.

760
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,220
We gotta isolate the boiler.

761
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,766
We gotta conserve everything
she's got left!

762
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,900
I keep tellin' you, Bouloo.
This boat just bad luck.

763
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:05,085
It's got nothing... to do... with luck.

764
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,808
Station Chatham, this is the CG-36500.

765
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,166
Do you copy?

766
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,340
This is Station Chatham.

767
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,807
36500, what is your location? Over.

768
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,740
Station Chatham, we, uh...

769
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,251
We are now passing Morris Island.

770
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:54,406
Heading down the channel
towards Chatham bar. Over.

771
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,860
What's it mean, going over that bar?

772
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,121
Miriam, don't do this to yourself.

773
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,571
Why not?

774
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,125
Why not, Gus?

775
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,284
If I'm gonna be with him, I wanna know.

776
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,411
You're the girl with the bear coat, right?

777
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:11,881
Yeah.

778
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,605
Yeah, that's me.

779
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:21,002
You gonna tell me
what it's like out there?

780
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:27,522
Shoals on that bar are never
in the same place twice.

781
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:31,204
Flood currents carryin' them
big ocean swells...

782
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,730
that rise up when they hit the shallows,
crash up against that bar.

783
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:38,130
Outgoing tide crashes up against that bar.

784
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:39,841
That, uh...

785
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:44,771
That man shouldn't have sent them out
to cross that bar in a storm like this.

786
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,050
Maybe they can turn back.

787
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:51,500
Maybe they get lost before.

788
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:52,886
Can't get out.

789
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,404
You know Bernie, right?

790
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:02,202
You know he won't get lost out there.

791
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:04,891
You know he follows the rules.

792
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,528
Yeah, we know.

793
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,724
We all going down to the pier soon.

794
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,605
See if there's anything
we can do down there.

795
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,570
Welcome to come.

796
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,884
Miriam. Miriam!

797
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:33,060
Miriam, please come here.

798
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,161
Miriam!

799
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,380
Excuse me, are you Commander Cluff?

800
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:40,481
Who are you?

801
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,500
I'm Miriam Penttinen,
Bernie Webber's girlfriend.

802
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,020
I want you to call Bernie back in.

803
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,260
That girl he was asking me about.

804
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,600
You know what he was gonna ask me?

805
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,300
For your permission to marry me.

806
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,369
Well, that's between you,
him and your God.

807
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,847
Asking me is just a formality.
He can marry you all he wants.

808
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,121
Don't he know that?

809
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,340
But you can't be in here, miss.

810
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,420
It's Bernie.

811
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,602
Chatham bar dead ahead. Over.

812
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,131
36500, Station Chatham.

813
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:07,011
Proceed as directed
towards Pendleton stern.

814
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,020
I didn't copy that, Station Chatham.

815
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,406
Conditions hazardous.

816
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:14,660
Why give us permission if
you're sending him out to die?

817
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,330
What the hell?

818
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:19,980
Gouthro, get her out of here.

819
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,860
Sir, winds have gone from 40 to 60...

820
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,803
since the call first come in.

821
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:26,860
That's gonna be
hurricane strength in an hour.

822
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,485
Gouthro, he's got his orders.

823
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:31,060
You get her out of here,
and you get yourself to bed.

824
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,764
You're too sick to be in here.

825
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,522
36500, Station Chatham,
proceed over the bar.

826
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,802
I repeat, proceed.

827
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:49,965
Once over, travel directly south.

828
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,580
The radar's intermittent...

829
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,060
but it's showing a pip 10 or 12 miles...

830
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:58,085
...east of Monomoy Point,
moving south. Over.

831
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,727
Station Chatham, this is the 500.

832
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,570
Copy that.

833
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,970
I hear what everyone's saying.

834
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,969
You don't know what you're doing.

835
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:24,527
Excuse me?

836
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:28,403
Maybe... Maybe it's because
you're not from here.

837
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,820
You don't know what it's like out there...

838
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,650
What the hell would you know
what it's like out there, miss?

839
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:33,961
Hmm?

840
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,420
Please, just call them back.

841
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:39,809
What do you think it's gonna be like
being married to a Coast Guard man?

842
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,445
Please, just call them back.

843
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:44,580
You gonna come in here scared
every time he out in the water?

844
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,060
Please call them back.

845
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,969
You don't belong here.

846
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,529
Please call them back.

847
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:54,220
Get out of here! Get out of my station!

848
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,060
And go home to where you belong, miss!

849
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,180
Please call them back.

850
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,442
Get out of my station!

851
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,289
Shoal's getting behind us.

852
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,980
Only chance now is a harder turn...

853
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:07,127
if the chains hold.

854
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:09,411
But it could capsize us.

855
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:29,646
That's good, boy.

856
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,768
You need to stand clear, boys!

857
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,420
If those shackles crack
and these chains snap...

858
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,010
it'll rip right through ya!

859
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,047
Here we go.

860
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,483
- Got her moving!
- Yeah!

861
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,204
Hear that?

862
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:20,281
That's it, that's the bar.

863
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,608
Couple minutes now, boys.

864
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:39,090
<i>When I was a little boy</i>

865
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:45,171
<i>So my mother told me</i>

866
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:48,608
<i>To me! Way, haul away</i>

867
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,046
Haul away

868
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:55,280
<i>We'll haul away Joe</i>

869
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:59,122
<i>Now, first I met a Yankee girl</i>

870
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:03,321
<i>She was fat and lazy To me!</i>

871
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,603
<i>Way haul away</i>

872
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:10,128
<i>We'll haul away Joe</i>

873
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:13,780
<i>And then I met an Irish girl</i>

874
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:17,248
<i>She damn near drove me crazy To me!</i>

875
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:21,608
<i>Way haul away</i>

876
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:25,042
<i>We'll haul away Joe</i>

877
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:28,450
<i>Now way, haul away</i>

878
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:31,660
<i>We're bound for better weather</i>

879
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:32,740
<i>To me!</i>

880
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:35,605
<i>Way haul away</i>

881
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:38,620
<i>We'll haul away Joe</i>

882
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:02,401
Hey, hey, boys!

883
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:06,060
We're not gonna be able
to see much, all right?

884
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,640
So we'll have to listen to
those waves hittin' that bar.

885
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:11,171
Gotta time it.

886
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:13,045
So I'm gonna wait for a lull...

887
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:15,700
and then we go.

888
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,131
We got faith in you, Skip!

889
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:18,700
Anytime you're ready...

890
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,860
you just go, Bernie, all right?

891
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:56,204
The compass is gone!

892
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,729
Fitzy! The engine died!

893
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:29,806
Ahh!

894
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,282
- I got it, I got it!
- No, you don't.

895
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,420
You got about five seconds, boys!

896
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:45,601
It's gravity-fed, it doesn't know
which way is up and down.

897
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:46,801
I know!

898
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,005
Come on, fire it up!

899
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:56,121
Yeah!

900
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,208
Maske! Get back here!

901
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:25,371
Tide's risin'.

902
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,805
It'll get us through.

903
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,762
But let me know what's comin'.

904
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:27,801
Hey, Fitz! We made it over the bar.

905
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,445
Back to the spotlight!

906
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:34,641
Coming out!

907
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:51,767
We turned too late!

908
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:55,362
We gotta buy that time back.

909
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:58,603
Tell Sybert we need 30 degrees
in the next two minutes...

910
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:00,165
or we'll miss that shoal!

911
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,740
Thirty degrees in the next two minutes!

912
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:06,285
Thirty degrees in the next two minutes.

913
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:11,162
Thirty degrees in the next two minutes!

914
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:13,171
Thirty degrees in the next two minutes.

915
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:20,291
We're putting her in reverse.

916
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:22,283
We're gonna let the ocean push us.

917
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:24,721
Hold on.

918
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:25,841
Okay.

919
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:51,685
Whoa!

920
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:31,562
You may wanna brace yourself, Eldon.

921
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,125
318!

922
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:42,608
316!

923
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:46,084
Close her down as soon as she hits!

924
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:49,610
312!

925
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:03,491
Gentlemen, brace yourselves.

926
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:06,326
Hold on!

927
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:14,300
Now!

928
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:18,561
Well...

929
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:24,401
You did it.

930
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:27,571
It bloody well worked, Mr. Sybert.

931
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,340
We gotta keep the water away
from the air inlets for the engine.

932
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:37,842
If we lose power, we'll lose our pumps.

933
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:41,700
And I'm afraid we're taking on
so much water...

934
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:43,643
the weight will pull us
right back off the shoal.

935
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:50,805
Feels funny not to be
moving around, huh, Eldon?

936
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:55,406
All right.

937
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:57,451
Let's get to it.

938
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:23,340
We're heading down to the lodge.

939
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:24,487
- Everything okay?
- Stop it!

940
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,100
- Hi!
- Quiet down now.

941
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:27,340
My God, give me a break.

942
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:29,900
Uh, I was on my way home.
My car spun out into a ditch.

943
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,445
I need some help.

944
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:33,645
Yeah, all right. We live near here.

945
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,450
We can go back to my house.
I'll call my brother.

946
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:36,721
He can tow you out. Jump in.

947
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:42,220
Thank you.

948
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:43,321
You don't got a coat?

949
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:44,620
You can move that.

950
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:48,140
We're bringing it down to St. Martin's
in case there are any survivors.

951
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:49,241
Oh, uh...

952
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,767
I left my coat at the Coast Guard station.

953
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:54,220
You got a man there?

954
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:55,481
Stop it!

955
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:57,481
Uh, I...

956
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:00,603
He's not there right now. It's, um...

957
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:03,601
It's Bernie Webber.

958
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:06,686
Yeah. Bernie, he's a good man.

959
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:26,325
We can't find them without
a compass, Bernie!

960
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,802
We got no idea where they are!

961
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:34,246
Hold on!

962
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:07,604
- You okay?
- Yeah.

963
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:09,420
You okay?

964
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:12,524
I'm having a great time now, Bernie!

965
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:13,841
Lot of fun!

966
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:21,082
- Brace yourselves!
- Oh...

967
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:36,685
Whole lotta... Whole lot of fun here.

968
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:47,420
Here. Come on, take it. Use it.

969
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:48,601
Got it, Pop!

970
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:56,660
We lost the pumps.

971
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:58,620
The pumps are tripping the breakers.

972
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:00,245
I'll go check the connection.

973
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:03,926
Give me the light.

974
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,282
It's not worth a damn, Bouloo.

975
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:09,801
Sometimes, I wish I didn't understand you.

976
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:12,804
Sybert, what's going on?

977
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:16,808
We're using every pump we've got.

978
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:20,081
We jammed the breakers so
the pumps wouldn't trip them.

979
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:21,969
We've got about two feet till the water...

980
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:24,961
hits those air inlets to the engines
and then the ship's dead.

981
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:26,246
Jesus Christ.

982
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:28,020
You hear that?

983
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:29,980
That's the tide rising,
gonna work us off this shoal.

984
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:33,084
Look, look, this'll at least
give us some time.

985
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:34,965
Isn't that right, Mr. Sybert?

986
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:36,645
That right. Sure does, boy.

987
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:40,570
Yeah, long as we got the generators
keeping the pumps going.

988
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:44,287
Buy whoever might be coming
to find us a little bit of time.

989
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,500
You wanted to be the man, Sybert.

990
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:46,601
Now you're the man, right?

991
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,920
Except you got no wife,
you got no kids back home.

992
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,364
You're a single man.

993
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:56,740
Always hiding down below.
What you got to lose?

994
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:57,921
All right, that's enough, Brown.

995
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:02,843
I'm scared, too, Brown.

996
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:05,963
I got a life, the same as you.

997
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:13,601
Just don't see the point
in sitting around talking about it.

998
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:20,527
Station Chatham, 36500.

999
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,802
Station Chatham, 36500.

1000
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:23,940
Do you copy?

1001
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:25,166
Station Chatham, this is Chief Bangs...

1002
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:28,180
CG-36383.

1003
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:33,127
Pollock lightship, CG-36500, do you copy?

1004
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:35,260
Why can't they hear us, Bernie?

1005
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:36,566
We can hear them!

1006
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:38,940
Seas are too high, zero headway,

1007
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,804
Station Chatham, do you copy?

1008
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:42,729
Repeat, we're coming home.

1009
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:45,168
Station Chatham to 36383,

1010
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:46,725
return to Old Harbor.

1011
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:50,049
Pollock lightship, CG-36500, do you copy?

1012
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:52,580
- We're all alone.
- Bangs, return to Old Harbor.

1013
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:54,011
You heard Bangs on the radio.

1014
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:55,380
It sounds like he couldn't get out.

1015
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:58,006
Going back in, the storm is getting worse.

1016
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,241
We should turn back in, Webber.

1017
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:03,850
Look, Bernie, we already made it out...

1018
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,128
further than anybody thought was possible.

1019
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:09,420
Maybe Richie's right.

1020
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:11,620
Maybe we should just go back.

1021
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:14,041
Winds at force of eight to nine.

1022
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:17,100
Repeat: Winds at force of eight to nine.

1023
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:18,247
Heavy snow squalls.

1024
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:19,885
You heard Bangs on the radio!

1025
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:21,180
We got no compass!

1026
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:23,123
We have no way to communicate!

1027
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:27,180
You're...

1028
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:30,602
What? What? I'm what, Richie?

1029
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:34,411
I got us out this far, didn't I?

1030
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:36,767
Not Bangs or Cluff, or nobody else.

1031
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:37,927
I did it!

1032
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,045
We did it, Richie.

1033
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,490
You wanna turn back around?

1034
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:54,767
No.

1035
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:56,725
No, not now. We came too far.

1036
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,410
We're not giving up on them.

1037
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,923
Not on my watch.

1038
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:07,765
Just do your job.

1039
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,087
Hey, Fitz!

1040
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:13,929
Turn off the beam, Fitz.

1041
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:15,280
We'll run her dark.

1042
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:18,765
Better shot at seeing light
from the Pendleton if we're running dark.

1043
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:27,940
Watch it!

1044
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:34,971
Get back here!

1045
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:37,340
Fitz!

1046
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:38,487
Get your butts back here!

1047
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:41,682
I lost my hat!

1048
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:51,481
Whoa...

1049
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:08,646
Are you okay?

1050
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:12,642
Yeah, yeah.

1051
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:14,844
I'm just tired.

1052
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,331
Come on.

1053
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:23,162
You kids go on and play in the bedroom.

1054
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:25,322
You can wait with them, miss,
while I call my brother.

1055
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:26,686
Thanks.

1056
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:28,569
Please call me Miriam.

1057
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:47,969
You think your mother would
mind if I turned on the radio?

1058
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,089
Coast Guard Boston, this is the Unimak.

1059
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:01,165
We're at the Mercer bow now,
here in support of the Yakutat.

1060
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:05,041
Four Mercer crewmen jumped
from the deck. All were lost.

1061
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:07,009
Repeat, four men lost.

1062
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:09,686
Several crew members have hypothermia.

1063
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:13,891
We're going to wait until daybreak
to attempt another rescue. Over.

1064
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:18,081
Does no good listening
to all that chatter, Miriam.

1065
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:20,210
Better learning to live not knowing.

1066
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:33,691
How long you been married to Bernie for?

1067
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:35,361
We're...

1068
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:42,082
We're not married yet.

1069
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:45,340
I don't know if I can...

1070
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:47,602
Like I said, Bernie, he's a good man.

1071
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:54,321
Him and some of them others
tried getting out a year ago...

1072
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:56,283
to save my husband Arne
and the crew of the Landry

1073
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:58,649
They were out fishing Monomoy
near Nantucket Sound...

1074
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,086
when the boat started taking on water.

1075
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:01,969
A night just like this.

1076
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:03,961
Come on.

1077
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:05,926
We gotta get going.

1078
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:07,180
My brother's on his way to come meet us.

1079
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:08,300
- Thanks.
- I gotta get down the lodge.

1080
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:09,606
Come on, you two.

1081
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:45,300
<i>For the people all said sit down</i>

1082
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:47,368
<i>Sit down, you're rockin' the boat</i>

1083
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:51,326
<i>For the people all said sit down</i>

1084
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:53,528
<i>Sit down, you're rockin' the boat</i>

1085
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:56,490
<i>And the devil may pull you under</i>

1086
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:59,325
<i>By the sharp lapels
Of your checkered coat</i>

1087
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:10,525
<i>Sit down, sit down, sit down</i>

1088
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:56,327
You know who she is?

1089
01:19:57,720 --> 01:20:00,200
Ain't Bernie's fault, Carl.
Ain't nobody's fault.

1090
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:01,620
Be like her blaming you.

1091
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,211
For what?

1092
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,580
You're the one that told them
there's another ship out there.

1093
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:08,569
They're out there because of you, right?

1094
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:25,641
Fitz.

1095
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:27,645
Turn on the search light.

1096
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:18,721
I can't believe we found her.
Look at that.

1097
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:24,211
We're too late.

1098
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:27,044
She's a ghost ship.

1099
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:33,085
- Are you seeing this, sir?
- Yeah.

1100
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:35,362
- You see that guy?
- Yeah, yeah, I see him.

1101
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:38,004
Not sure I believe it.

1102
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:43,368
Where the hell's he going?

1103
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,404
Good to see ya, boys!

1104
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:11,060
How we gonna fit them all on this boat?

1105
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:13,606
We're only built to hold 12, includin' us.

1106
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:17,322
That's just regulation, though, right?

1107
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:22,890
How many can she fit?

1108
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:25,925
20, 22, tops.

1109
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:29,820
Wait!

1110
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,604
They're coming down here.

1111
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:57,849
- Drop the stanchion!
- Port side!

1112
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:23,641
Come on!

1113
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:30,003
Come on! I got ya!

1114
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:51,721
We got ya!

1115
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:03,085
Maske, get over here!

1116
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:06,686
Come on!

1117
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:08,171
Grab him!

1118
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:27,208
You know where you're going now, miss?

1119
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:29,645
I think so.

1120
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:32,100
Thanks for your help, Mr. Nickerson.

1121
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:33,201
Yeah.

1122
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:35,281
You know...

1123
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:38,380
Bernie ain't out there because of me.

1124
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:39,527
Yeah, I know.

1125
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:43,481
It's Bernie's job to go out, right?

1126
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:48,803
How can I blame you for it?

1127
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:05,924
Nice and slow. Nice and slow.

1128
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:07,286
You'll be all right.

1129
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:08,580
Pete, you're next.

1130
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:10,603
Take it nice and slow. Easy, easy.

1131
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:11,761
Come on!

1132
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:22,168
You gotta go, we're leaving nobody behind!

1133
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:23,340
Eldon, get on the ladder!

1134
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:24,601
Come on, we gotta get them down!

1135
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:30,008
She's slipping!
We gotta get off this ship!

1136
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:31,121
Hurry!

1137
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:33,369
Eldon? How you doing?

1138
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:36,329
I'm scared.

1139
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:41,521
Well...

1140
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:45,202
Gonna be a lot scarier up here without us.

1141
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:47,283
You gotta listen to me!

1142
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:48,966
Eldon.

1143
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:52,646
You just follow right behind me.

1144
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:55,167
If I can do it, anyone can.

1145
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:10,161
Come on!

1146
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:33,162
Tiny!

1147
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:39,011
Tiny! Tiny, hold on!

1148
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:40,321
Hey!

1149
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:36,820
Eldon.

1150
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:38,081
Eldon!

1151
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:42,930
Eldon, look at me!

1152
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:44,246
Look at me!

1153
01:28:56,640 --> 01:28:58,220
When I say jump, let go.

1154
01:28:58,320 --> 01:28:59,321
You ready?

1155
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,460
Jump!

1156
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:13,601
You okay?

1157
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:24,807
We're riding so heavy,
you can hardly steer.

1158
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:28,282
Sir, they're saying there's still
seven or eight up there on board.

1159
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:32,804
Maybe we take these guys back in...

1160
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:35,121
and come back out.

1161
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:45,130
We can't leave them out here alone.

1162
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:47,404
That boat won't last.

1163
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:51,848
We all live, or we all die.

1164
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:55,521
Right?

1165
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,000
You, uh...

1166
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:33,403
You did good.

1167
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:37,084
You should be
the last one off, Mr. Sybert.

1168
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:36,647
Last man!

1169
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,420
Hey, Fitz!

1170
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:20,682
Turn off that search light, yeah?

1171
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:47,967
We were in radio contact
with the McCullough.

1172
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:51,980
They said they lost four men,
but saved the rest.

1173
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:53,540
The captain of the Pollock Rip
sent word that they...

1174
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:54,766
Mr. Cluff!

1175
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:57,500
It's the 36500! It's Bernie!

1176
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:58,860
It's right there on the radio.

1177
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:02,760
Station Chatham? Station Chatham, copy?

1178
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:06,860
CG-36500, this is Station Chatham.

1179
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:08,180
Webber, is that you?

1180
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:10,851
Yes, sir, it's me. It's Bernie.

1181
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:16,100
We got 32 survivors aboard...

1182
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:17,645
from the tanker Pendleton, sir.

1183
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:20,084
Station Chatham, do you copy?

1184
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:22,447
36500, Station Chatham.

1185
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:25,404
Did you say you have 32 survivors on board?

1186
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:27,740
They rescued them.
They rescued 32 of them!

1187
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:30,081
Yes, sir, 32.

1188
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:33,210
Sir, we've lost our compass,
so we don't know where we are.

1189
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:35,444
But we're gonna try to make it back home.

1190
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:37,127
Can't get back without a compass.

1191
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:39,441
- Not in this weather.
- They're not gonna make it back.

1192
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:42,603
You lost your compass, Webber.

1193
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:45,811
Negative, 36500,
this is the Pollock lightship.

1194
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:47,325
Do not proceed to shore.

1195
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:50,962
We're five miles northeast
of the Pendleton's last known location.

1196
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:52,963
Proceed to our position. Over.

1197
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:55,180
CG-36500, Station Chatham.

1198
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:58,090
Proceed to the Pollock lightship...

1199
01:34:58,200 --> 01:34:59,645
and unload all survivors. Over.

1200
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:02,330
What do they know, right?

1201
01:35:04,160 --> 01:35:05,969
Right, Richie?

1202
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:09,646
CG-36500, do you copy?

1203
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:16,540
If they know where they are
someone tell me where I am...

1204
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:18,529
because I don't know
where the hell we are.

1205
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:20,165
Webber, do you copy?

1206
01:35:20,680 --> 01:35:22,409
I'm not heading out to sea.

1207
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:23,801
No.

1208
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:25,900
This is Station Chatham. Do you copy?

1209
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,780
We just got you all off a boat...

1210
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:31,486
so there's no way we're gonna
get you all back up one.

1211
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:34,100
CG-36500, this is Station Chatham.

1212
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:36,202
Webber, your orders are to proceed...

1213
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:37,651
five miles northeast...

1214
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:40,007
and unload all survivors
onto the Pollock...

1215
01:35:55,320 --> 01:35:57,129
Sounds like he cut off
his radio, Mr. Cluff.

1216
01:35:58,040 --> 01:35:59,690
He's going it on his own.

1217
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:02,526
Bernie Webber.

1218
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:05,400
What do ya know?

1219
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:07,050
How are they gonna find their way home?

1220
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:09,004
He must have shut off his radio.

1221
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:12,420
Those poor boys.

1222
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:14,010
I can't believe that's happening.

1223
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:23,881
Some more stuff in the car.

1224
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:31,860
Power's out now.

1225
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:34,246
- How they gonna see their way home?
- Power's out.

1226
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:38,643
The whole town. The power's out.

1227
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:42,201
- Worse than last year.
- They'll never make it.

1228
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:03,086
Let's get down to the pier.

1229
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:15,169
How'd you find us without a compass?

1230
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:17,411
We, uh...

1231
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:21,969
We just jogged along with
the seasonal currents.

1232
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:29,040
I think we just got lucky.

1233
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:31,361
Yeah.

1234
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:34,247
Lucky.

1235
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:39,764
So, you know how to get home?

1236
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:43,407
To be honest with ya, I'm not sure.

1237
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:47,881
Just disobeyed all my ranking officers...

1238
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:49,481
and they don't know...

1239
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:51,284
so I guess I'd better then, right?

1240
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:54,367
Had the wind on my left going out.

1241
01:37:54,840 --> 01:37:58,260
Figure if I, uh...

1242
01:37:58,360 --> 01:38:01,642
keep her on my right we ought to be
heading the right direction.

1243
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:05,180
We just follow the lights on shore.

1244
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:07,203
Follow all the lights on shore.

1245
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:22,648
Well, we're in your hands, Captain.

1246
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:33,561
Listen up!

1247
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:40,122
I'll put the sea behind us.

1248
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:44,940
Just let it push us along
till we lay up somewhere.

1249
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:47,060
The storm's easing up, boys...

1250
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:50,500
so we just look for the lights
on the shore to guide us in.

1251
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:53,968
Even if we have to go so far
as Nobska Point, so be it.

1252
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:56,560
We just gotta find land.

1253
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:04,243
Been one heck of a long day,
right, fellas?

1254
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:05,966
Yeah.

1255
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:08,005
Sure has.

1256
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:12,606
But don't you give up hope on me now.

1257
01:39:14,840 --> 01:39:17,286
She's a good boat. She'll get us through.

1258
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:22,485
We'll get you home, okay?
We're all going home.

1259
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:25,980
We're with you, Skipper!

1260
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:30,011
Yeah!

1261
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:52,928
Keep your lights on! Like she's doing!

1262
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:54,860
Quick, turn your lights on!

1263
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:56,660
Turn your headlights on! Everyone!

1264
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:58,046
Turn 'em on!

1265
01:42:58,680 --> 01:43:00,842
More lights so they can see us!

1266
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:52,881
I think we made it over the bar.

1267
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:58,700
I think high tide carried us over.

1268
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:01,644
Richie, you see that?

1269
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:24,567
Fitz!

1270
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:26,644
Turn on the search light!

1271
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,604
Look, you see that?

1272
01:45:13,240 --> 01:45:14,480
Is it them?

1273
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:19,129
Well done, Bernie!

1274
01:45:19,720 --> 01:45:21,300
You did it, Webber!

1275
01:45:21,400 --> 01:45:23,084
Way to go, Webber!

1276
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:27,090
36500 is now docking at the Chatham pier.

1277
01:45:27,240 --> 01:45:29,100
There appear to be 32 survivors, sir.

1278
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:30,860
Repeat, they have 32 survivors.

1279
01:45:45,800 --> 01:45:47,245
That's right.

1280
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:48,805
Throw it, son.

1281
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:54,764
Attaboy, Bernie!

1282
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:06,891
Give 'em a hand.

1283
01:46:08,120 --> 01:46:09,690
Good to see you. Get on up here.

1284
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:10,780
Nice and easy.

1285
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:12,980
We never thought we'd see you again.

1286
01:46:13,080 --> 01:46:14,700
This guy's freezing. Give me your coat.

1287
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:16,370
Go on in. It's warm inside.

1288
01:46:18,760 --> 01:46:20,250
Let's get you up to the lodge.

1289
01:46:20,440 --> 01:46:22,807

1290
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:38,600
Good job, Captain.

1291
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:43,851
Way to go, Bernie.

1292
01:46:56,320 --> 01:46:57,321
Webber.

1293
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:26,361
Bernie.

1294

Let's go home.

1295
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:43,727
Are we still good for April 16th?

1296
01:48:44,240 --> 01:48:46,242
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1297
01:48:47,200 --> 01:48:48,725
I asked Cluff for ya.

1298
01:48:50,240 --> 01:48:51,287
He said it's just a...

1299
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:52,930
Just a formality.

1300
01:48:54,280 --> 01:48:55,380
Now I know, right?

1301
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:41,211
<i>When I was a little boy</i>

1302
01:52:42,640 --> 01:52:47,123
<i>Or so my mother told me</i>

1303
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:54,125
<i>Way, haul away</i>

1304
01:52:54,840 --> 01:52:59,801

1309
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:25,420
<i>We rode it far, homeward bound</i>

1310
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:28,171
<i>Took it free and easy</i>

1311
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:32,122
<i>Setting sail to newfound lands</i>

1312
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:35,369
<i>The wind was high and breezy</i>

1313
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:39,140
<i>We overcome and rose above</i>

1314
01:53:39,240 --> 01:53:42,369
<i>The storm that we were facing</i>

1315
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:45,860
<i>Finally arriving home</i>

1316
01:53:45,960 --> 01:53:49,328

1317

01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:35,086
<i>We sail on away</i>

1327
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:38,443
<i>With the music playing freely</i>

1328
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:42,282
<i>Our spirits light and gay</i>

1329
01:54:42,600 --> 01:54:47,811
<i>We sail on today</i>

1330
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:55,940
<i>Way, haul away</i>

1331
01:54:56,040 --> 01:54:59,442
<i>We'll haul away Joe</i>

1332

<i>We'll haul away Joe</i>

1338
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:35,609
<i>Now up aloft</i>

1339
01:55:36,360 --> 01:55:39,250
<i>This yard must go</i>

1340
01:55:40,360 --> 01:55:47,209
<i>We'll pull her free and easy</i>

1340
01:55:48,305 --> 01:56:48,666
