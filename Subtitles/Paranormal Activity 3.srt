313
00:15:55,483 --> 00:15:57,401
Like when people think
they see the Virgin Mary in their toast.

314
00:15:57,485 --> 00:15:58,568
- That's you right now.
- Oh, that's hilarious.

315
00:15:58,653 --> 00:16:00,862
This has to be erased
and this has to be erased.

316
00:16:00,989 --> 00:16:03,115
I'm sorry.
Or we're never having sex again.

317
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,076
I'm late. I got to go.
Thanks for erasing both of them.

318
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,787
You know,
you're going to regret saying that.

319
00:16:08,871 --> 00:16:09,913
Doubt it.

320
00:16:09,998 --> 00:16:12,124
I don't think you can go a day
without having sex, personally.

321
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:13,583
(IN SING-SONG) Don't dare me.

322
00:16:13,668 --> 00:16:16,169
- Erase it.
- I'm not going to erase it.

323
00:16:17,338 --> 00:16:19,256
- Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Hey.

324
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,800
Dude, what are you doing, man?
You're always so late.

325
00:16:21,884 --> 00:16:23,343
I know, it's my car!

326
00:16:23,469 --> 00:16:24,720
I got the earthquake.

327
00:16:24,846 --> 00:16:26,638
- Did you really?
- On tape.

328
00:16:26,723 --> 00:16:27,889
It's scary, right? Is that Julie?

329
00:16:28,016 --> 00:16:29,057
It's nothing, it's nothing.

330
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,559
- We're going to...
- Is that a sex tape?

331
00:16:30,685 --> 00:16:32,894
Yeah. I got...
This weird thing happened after...

332
00:16:33,021 --> 00:16:34,062
She let you make a sex tape?

333
00:16:34,188 --> 00:16:36,106
Yeah, but it got interrupted
by the earthquake.

334
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,774
I wouldn't have let
anything interrupt that.

335
00:16:37,859 --> 00:16:39,985
Relax, man, just relax.
Would you just stop?

336
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:42,112
- Let me slow-mo shuttle forward.
- Just shut up.

337
00:16:42,196 --> 00:16:43,488
DENNIS: Check this out. Ready?

338
00:16:43,573 --> 00:16:45,282
All right, let me tweak the contrast here.

339
00:16:45,366 --> 00:16:46,408
Okay.

340
00:16:46,534 --> 00:16:47,534
I'm gonna take the color out.

341
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,412
It looks like dust is falling on something.

342
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:52,205
It looks like a figure, right?

343
00:16:52,332 --> 00:16:53,498
- You see that?
- Yeah.

344
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,250
Did you catch that?

345
00:16:55,376 --> 00:16:56,626
- Yeah, it moved.
- Did you see the dust move?

346
00:16:56,711 --> 00:16:58,128
- It moved, right?
- What was that?

347
00:16:58,212 --> 00:16:59,796
I don't know. Check it out.

348
00:16:59,881 --> 00:17:01,340
- It's weird, right?
- It's kind of weird.

349
00:17:01,424 --> 00:17:04,051
You know, I've been hearing
these noises in the girls' room lately.

350
00:17:04,177 --> 00:17:06,470
I don't know. I feel like it's...

351
00:17:06,554 --> 00:17:07,929
Something weird's going on.

352
00:17:08,056 --> 00:17:10,265
- DENNIS: Julie?
- Yeah, I'm back here.

353
00:17:12,226 --> 00:17:14,644
Hey, um, I wanted to talk to you...

354
00:17:14,729 --> 00:17:15,771
(SHRIEKS) Dennis!

355
00:17:15,897 --> 00:17:16,897
Oh, sorry! Sorry.

356
00:17:17,065 --> 00:17:18,065
Oh, my God!

357
00:17:18,191 --> 00:17:19,191
(LAUGHS) Sorry.

358
00:17:19,275 --> 00:17:21,234
You mind if I set up
a couple cameras around the house?

359
00:17:21,361 --> 00:17:23,153
I'm not going to talk to you right now.

360
00:17:23,237 --> 00:17:25,238
Okay, I'll... I'll take that as a yes?

361
00:17:25,365 --> 00:17:28,075
- I hate you!
- Okay. Love you, too.

362
00:17:30,078 --> 00:17:31,661
KATIE: How long do the tapes last?

363
00:17:31,746 --> 00:17:32,996
DENNIS: About six hours each.

364
00:17:33,081 --> 00:17:35,123
So you have to change
them every six hours?

365
00:17:35,249 --> 00:17:36,458
Mmm, yes.

366
00:17:38,086 --> 00:17:39,669
Katie, can you hop out of the frame?

367
00:17:39,754 --> 00:17:41,880
- Okay. Is that good?
- Yeah, so I can...

368
00:17:41,964 --> 00:17:43,590
Keep going.

369
00:17:43,716 --> 00:17:45,967
- KATIE: Can I see it?
- Sure.

370
00:17:46,094 --> 00:17:48,178
Here. Come here. See it?

371
00:17:48,262 --> 00:17:49,346
Yeah.

372
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,348
- Pretty cool, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

373
00:17:51,432 --> 00:17:53,266
So, what are you trying to see?

374
00:17:53,393 --> 00:17:55,185
Uh, anything unusual or strange.

375
00:17:55,269 --> 00:17:57,187
Oh, no, it's not that.
Don't touch the camera.

376
00:17:57,271 --> 00:17:58,855
- Kristi?
- Yeah?

377
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,524
Don't touch the camera or anything.

378
00:18:00,608 --> 00:18:02,109
Katie, just leave it alone.

379
00:18:02,693 --> 00:18:04,111
(CLATTERING)

380
00:18:08,783 --> 00:18:10,200
- Dennis.
- What?

381
00:18:10,284 --> 00:18:11,451
Really?

382
00:18:13,162 --> 00:18:14,704
Don't you think
you're overreacting a little?

383
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:15,997
This is a new house.

384
00:18:16,124 --> 00:18:18,166
It shouldn't be making these noises.

385
00:18:18,292 --> 00:18:21,294
Not just in here.
It's in the girls' room, too.

386
00:18:23,798 --> 00:18:24,840
No...

387
00:18:26,634 --> 00:18:28,427
This is not gonna work here.

388
00:18:28,511 --> 00:18:30,887
Like, what do you think
you're gonna catch?

389
00:18:30,972 --> 00:18:32,973
Whatever's in our house.

390
00:18:34,183 --> 00:18:37,602
Oh, right, 'cause there's
something here watching us.

391
00:18:40,273 --> 00:18:42,149
Well, there's definitely something.

392
00:18:42,275 --> 00:18:46,403
I... I feel it.
I feel something, I'm telling you.

393
00:18:46,487 --> 00:18:48,071
JULIE: Yeah, I feel something, too.
I'm not gonna lie.

394
00:18:48,156 --> 00:18:49,239
I feel a camera.

395
00:18:49,323 --> 00:18:52,951
The earthquake, and all those...

396
00:18:53,035 --> 00:18:55,203
I don't know,
stuff that's been happening and...

397
00:18:55,329 --> 00:18:57,164
I don't know, I just...

398
00:18:57,665 --> 00:18:59,541
No, it's totally normal.

399
00:19:00,668 --> 00:19:01,877
(SIGHS)

400
00:19:04,005 --> 00:19:05,380
Bye, camera.

401
00:19:07,884 --> 00:19:09,426
Good night, camera.

402
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,760
(KISSES)

403
00:19:33,367 --> 00:19:34,659
(CREAKING)

404
00:19:34,744 --> 00:19:36,495
(PATTERING)

405
00:20:12,198 --> 00:20:13,365
Yeah?

406
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,410
Yeah, probably.

407
00:20:19,413 --> 00:20:20,497
In their bedroom.

408
00:20:20,581 --> 00:20:23,250
Be quiet, so we don't wake Katie up.

409
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,586
(WHISPERING) It's okay.

410
00:20:29,757 --> 00:20:30,882
Why?

411
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:35,929
Oh.

412
00:20:36,055 --> 00:20:37,931
Yeah, kind of.

413
00:20:38,057 --> 00:20:39,766
He's very sweet.

414
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,741
Yeah, I saw that.

415
00:20:57,076 --> 00:20:58,952
I watched some of the tapes
on the camera

416
00:20:59,078 --> 00:21:02,330
and I saw you
talking to somebody late last night.

417
00:21:02,456 --> 00:21:06,084
If you saw me talking to somebody,
it would be Toby.

418
00:21:06,168 --> 00:21:08,920
(CHUCKLES) Toby's your friend?

419
00:21:09,005 --> 00:21:10,589
Yes. He's my friend.

420
00:21:10,673 --> 00:21:12,799
Yeah, what do you guys talk about?

421
00:21:12,925 --> 00:21:14,050
Mmm, secrets.

422
00:21:14,135 --> 00:21:16,469
- He's big?
- Mmm-hmm.

423
00:21:16,596 --> 00:21:18,471
So, is he old, like Grandma,

424
00:21:18,598 --> 00:21:20,515
or is he young, like you?

425
00:21:21,809 --> 00:21:24,144
He's old, like Grandma.

426
00:21:24,979 --> 00:21:26,229
And what does he look like?

427
00:21:26,314 --> 00:21:28,982
Is he tall? Is he fat?

428
00:21:29,108 --> 00:21:30,859
He's tall. He's tall.

429
00:21:32,653 --> 00:21:33,862
Don't call him fat.

430
00:21:33,988 --> 00:21:37,073
Kristi, when you say that
if you tell one of your secrets

431
00:21:37,158 --> 00:21:40,285
that you'll be in trouble with Toby,
what does that mean?

432
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:42,787
Well, I won't be safe.

433
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,916
He's gonna...
Did he say he's gonna hurt you?

434
00:21:47,001 --> 00:21:48,043
No.

435
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,087
But I won't be safe.

436
00:21:51,172 --> 00:21:53,465
That means, I will be, like...

437
00:21:54,175 --> 00:21:57,177
Be in very, very big trouble.

438
00:21:57,845 --> 00:21:59,429
Big trouble.

439
00:21:59,513 --> 00:22:00,680
DENNIS: You saw her.
JULIE: That's how it is.

440
00:22:00,806 --> 00:22:02,182
It was like he was actually there, right?

441
00:22:02,308 --> 00:22:03,308
I know.

442
00:22:03,392 --> 00:22:05,810
Because that's how active
kids' imaginations are.

443
00:22:05,895 --> 00:22:06,936
It's crazy.

444
00:22:07,021 --> 00:22:08,271
I mean, imagination is one thing.

445
00:22:08,356 --> 00:22:09,981
She got up in the middle of the night.

446
00:22:10,066 --> 00:22:12,525
I mean, it's a little odd
that she got up in the middle...

447
00:22:12,652 --> 00:22:15,111
You haven't been around kids
for that long. They do weird things.

448
00:22:15,196 --> 00:22:17,864
They... Katie used to get up
in the middle of the night

449
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,574
and she used to sleep on the toilet.

450
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,867
(LAUGHING) What?

451
00:22:20,993 --> 00:22:22,118
Okay? I'm serious.

452
00:22:22,203 --> 00:22:23,244
Really?

453
00:22:23,371 --> 00:22:26,956
Yes. Toby is a phase and he's going to
be gone in a couple weeks.

454
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:28,083
I know it.

455
00:22:28,209 --> 00:22:29,793
RANDY: How many hours of footage
do you have?

456
00:22:29,877 --> 00:22:32,921
This is the job, man. I got two cameras,

457
00:22:33,047 --> 00:22:35,382
six hours each. Twelve hours.

458
00:22:35,466 --> 00:22:37,884
- Twelve hours of footage?
- Yeah. Got to do it, man.

459
00:22:37,968 --> 00:22:40,011
- I'm seriously gonna review it.
- ...of footage every day.

460
00:22:40,096 --> 00:22:42,138
Yes. Now, please,
I'm trying to concentrate.

461
00:22:42,223 --> 00:22:45,141
That's so stupid.
There's only 24 hours in a day, Dennis.

462
00:22:45,226 --> 00:22:46,726
- RANDY: Hey, Julie.
- ...going?

463
00:22:46,811 --> 00:22:47,977
DENNIS: Um... Good.

464
00:22:48,062 --> 00:22:51,314
You want to step into my office
and do some work with me or...

465
00:22:51,399 --> 00:22:53,400
No. You find anything?

466
00:22:53,484 --> 00:22:56,611
RANDY: Yes, actually.
We did find something.

467
00:22:56,737 --> 00:23:00,490
We found that
your family sleeps all night. Oh!

468
00:23:00,574 --> 00:23:01,658
Very funny, Randy.

469
00:23:01,742 --> 00:23:03,076
- Keep up the good work.
- DENNIS: Okay.

470
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,994

- Yeah.

631
00:34:19,043 --> 00:34:22,545
- What... What is it?
- I took your fan...

632
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:25,799
And basically, took apart...

633
00:34:25,883 --> 00:34:28,927
Basically, the oscillator
on your fan allows me to see

both in the living room
and in the kitchen.

Cool. Wait, what? You broke my fan?

and then you turn the lights back on

to see her body in the mirror

and she's gonna try to kill you.
