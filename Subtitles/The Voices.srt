00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:28,522
Hey, Jerry.

3
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:33,026
- Hey, Mr. Kowalski.
- Call me Dennis. It's okay.

4
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:38,031
Just wanted to say, we're very pleased.
You're doing a great job.

5
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,241
Thank you, Mr. Kowalski.

6
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,411
That's what I told that lady
from the courts. "A great job," I said.

7
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,496
- She's your lawyer?
- She's a court-appointed psychiatrist,

8
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,915
Dennis. Thank you, for...
Thank you for saying that.

9
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:50,377
No problem. So, Jerry, the thing is,

10
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:53,589
is Milton Fixtures, every year,
has the company party.

11
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,174
- A barbecue.
- Okay.

12
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,510
And we get one representative
from each department to help put it on,

13
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,761
usually the new guy.

14
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:03,015
And the new guy in shipping is you.

15
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,935
So you want me to help plan a party?

16
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:10,522
It's voluntary, off-the-clock.
There will be others, too.

17
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,858
Someone from sales, a guy from design,

18
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:15,611
that cute English chick
in accounting, Fiona.

19
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,113
- You wanna do it?
- Yes, I do. Of course, I do. Thank you.

20
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,698
Cool. First meeting
is tomorrow night at 5:00

21
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:22,284
- in the sales conference room.
- Yeah, I wanna get it on. I wanna get it on.

22
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,744
- The company buys pizza and beer.
- Okay, I'm in.

23
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:27,539
- Thank you, Dennis. Thank you, Dennis.
- It'll be fun. Okay, okay.

24
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,556
Bosco.

25
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:47,476
Who's my guy?
Who's my guy?

26
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,396
Who's my guy? Who's my guy?
Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?

27
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:54,316
You're a good boy.
You're a good boy.

28
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,036
- What you doing, Jerry?
- Something for work.

29
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,330
Those assholes give you homework now?

30
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,667
Trying on a shirt for tomorrow.

31
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,169
They got something that they want me to do.

32
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,714
- A shirt? Shouldn't that be a straitjacket?
- Shut up.

33
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,384
You act like they're doing you a favor
letting you work there,

34
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:23,845
like they should be able to fuck you
in the ass without lube whenever they want.

35
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:28,016
Like some big privilege,
letting you work for free on their picnic.

36
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,000
- How do you know about the picnic?
- I know everything, Jerry.

37
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,815
- At 6:00...
- I'm not talking to you.

38
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,943
They mock you
the second you leave the room, Jerry.

39
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:41,154
- You're an unstable crybaby.
- I am not a crybaby.

40
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:44,157
You're crying right now, liar. Come on.

41
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,800
The only reason they don't fire your ass

42
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,620
is because you're so hopelessly pathetic,
you amuse them.

43
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:49,705
Shut up!

44
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:01,550
Before we break up here,
I wanna go over the assignments.

45
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:05,971
We're just gonna go around the table, okay?
Can your comment wait?

46
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:08,307
I just wanna say that the picnic
is gonna be a good place

47
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:11,685
to reach out and form relationships
with other people.

48
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:15,897
Duly noted, Jerry.

49
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:17,816
We all wanna get out of here,

50
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,945
so, John, you'll be setting up
the barbecue grills in the parking lot.

51
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:25,407
Dave's bringing drinks.
Sheryl's providing decorations,

52
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,410
and Fiona's doing the music.
Any questions?

53
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,413
Yeah. I've got an idea,
while we were sitting here.

54
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,290
You know the office corridor?

55
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:36,460
I thought it would be the perfect
place for a conga line.

56
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:40,213
- Like at a wedding?
- Or a cruise ship.

57
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,341
It's really easy, anyone can conga.

58
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,217
I'll set my head on fire before I conga.

59
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,596
Men are afraid to dance.
The male ego is too fragile.

60
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,891
I'm not afraid. I'm a man.
I think it sounds real fun.

61
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,268
Thanks, Jerry.

62
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,228
Well, it's not the coolest
thing in the world,

63
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,647
but we are talking about a party
in a toilet factory after all.

64
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,192
Okay, it's settled,
we'll go with a conga line.

65
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:01,943
Moving on. Jerry?

66
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:05,697
I'm setting up the PA system tomorrow,
so if everything works out, I'm good to go.

67
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:11,453
And I thank you all.
And my extension in shipping is 5-1865.

68
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:12,704
Running for office, Jerry?

69
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,414
- No.
- Dave, go screw yourself.

70
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,377
Sheryl, Dave, come on. We're done here.
We'll see you all at the picnic.

71
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:22,130
Anyone who wants
the leftover pizza, please take it.

72
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,521
Hey, do you want any of this pizza, John?

73
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,147
Cold pizza? No, thank you.

74
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:43,360
- Free pizza. What's better than free pizza?
- Lots of things.

75
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:46,071
- Sushi, for example.
- That's like raw fish, right?

76
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:50,826
No. It's perfectly cooked rice,
seasoned by a master chef,

77
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:53,495
on top of which he places
specially selected slices

78
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:56,665
of the highest quality,
line-caught ocean fish.

79
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,251
Raw fish. Gross.

80
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,336
You should stick to fast food.

81
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,966
- Jerry?
- Hey, Fiona.

82
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:10,762
Hey. Can your sound system
play music from an iPod?

83
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,681
I think so, yeah.

84
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,599
Cool, it's a plan. See you.

85
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:35,871
- How are you doing, Jerry?
- Very well, thank you. Excellent. Yeah.

86
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,789
Do tell.

87
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:41,877
Well, they like me at work.

88
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,545
You're a likeable man.

89
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:48,717
We're having, a what-do-you-call-it, a picnic.
And they asked me to help out on it.

90
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,635
I was afraid to say yes.

91
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,515
- And then I said yes.
- And?

92
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:58,393
And now I'm setting up the sound system.

93
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,397
That's wonderful news.
You're becoming part of something.

94
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,983
Any side effects with the meds?

95
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,068
I don't know.

96
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,654
- Are you taking them?
- I don't know.

97
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,282
You have to take them.

98
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,950
Okay.

99
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,538
- Any thoughts of suicide?
- No. None.

100
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,833
Do you ever hear voices?

101
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:27,464
Voices? No. I mean,
when someone is talking to me.

102
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,092
You hesitated a little bit there.

103
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,928
It just makes me think of my mother.

104
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:37,057
"Angels" was what she called her voices.

105
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:38,975
Yeah.

106
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:43,813
Angels were her coping strategy.
The voices were real to her.

107
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:47,442
Angels were a reasonable attempt
to craft a logical explanation.

108
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,110
I know, I know that. I know that, yeah.

109
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:52,072
I know. She was the best mother
that she knew how to be. You know?

110
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,074
Right. Exactly.

111
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,786
Do you have any questions for me, Jerry?

112
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,788
Yeah. I got a big one for you.

113
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,915
Okay.

114
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:06,670
There's a girl. I like her.

115
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:09,297
Go on.

116
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,217
I don't know how much
to tell her, you know,

117
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,177
about you and this, and my mom and stuff.

118
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,303
And?

119
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,390
I don't wanna scare her away,

120
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,851
but I don't wanna lie to her either.

121
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,146
I'm thinking that if the subject comes up,

122
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:29,609
I'll just tell her, but if it doesn't,

123
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,444
I'll just leave it be.

124
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:34,406
You answered your own question, Jerry.

125
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,657
Why are you smiling?

126
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,536
- We're gonna conga tomorrow.
- Conga?

127
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:44,541
Yeah. Yeah, like at a wedding.
It's gonna be amazing.

128
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,585
Conga?

129
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:50,815
Hey, buddy. Bosco, what a day, what a day.
I wish you could have been there.

130
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,902
Did you fuck the bitch?

131
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,530
I don't have to answer that.

132
00:10:57,573 --> 00:11:00,909
And you'll never fuck her either
because you disgust her.

133
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,411
Yeah, shut up, cat.

134
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:07,332
She's from England, Jerry.
In her eyes, you're a ridiculous peasant.

135
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:12,003
Yeah. Guess what?
I'm not a peasant, Mr. Whiskers.

136
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:15,590
I'm thinking that this is
a real good time for a walk. Jerry?

137
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,592
I think that's a fantastic idea.

138
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,094
You're out your league.

139
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,596
She drinks tea in carriages and fucks men

140
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,599
with names like Nigel or Aidan
or Lord Ribblesdale.

141
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,309
Not Jerry Hickfang.

142
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,853
- Go choke on a hairball.
- Cat-hater.

143
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,605
Come on, Bosco. Let's go, buddy. Come on.

144
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,567
Sing a happy song

145
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:38,571
Come on, sing along, sing a happy song

146
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:42,117
Get up and dance, sing a happy song

147
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,703
Come on, make some romance
Sing a happy song

148
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:49,124
- Hey, Jer, give me a break.
- Okay, I'll tone it down a little bit.

149
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,626
You have the greatest hair, Tom.

150
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,671
In the back, it's awesome.

151
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,431
Shift's over, Jer.

152
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,489
- Jerry?
- Hi.

153
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,616
Fiona.

154
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:28,037
You said I should come by
accounting some time.

155
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,831
- I did?
- Yeah.

156
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,792
When we were getting ready for the picnic.

157
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:36,421
No. I don't recall saying that.

158
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:39,382
Hi, Jerry. I'm Lisa. Accounts Receivable.

159
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,177
Jerry, Packing and Shipping.

160
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:46,222
Some of the accounting chicks
are going out for a couple of drinks.

161
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:49,017
If you wanna pack and ship out with us?

162
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,852
Yeah. That sounds... Yeah.

163
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,255
- Let's go.
- Yeah, let's get going.

164
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,482
Okay.

165
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,695
So he looks me in the eye and he says,

166
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,698
"Let's move to America, Fi.
Let's get married."

167
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:07,202
So, after I've sold everything and moved,

168
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,872
that's when the knobhead decides
that he's not the marrying type.

169
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,374
Yeah, six months later, he marries Jill.

170
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,587
Now they got three kids,
and I'm stuck in this stupid temp job.

171
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,798
I think it's time to move back home.

172
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,841
I know karate.

173
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:30,433
Thanks for coming out, Jerry. It's cool.

174
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:36,981
Do you want my last Krunchy Choo Choo?
I only had a bite.

175
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,483
Yeah, sure.

176
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:45,907
Hey, can you give me a ride to my car?
Or just home, you know.

177
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,620
Sorry.

178
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,790
You're giving a ride to Fiona.

179
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,376
No, no, no, no, no. It's okay, Jerry.
I've got a lift so...

180
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,379
I don't mind, Fi,
I'd love to give you a ride.

181
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:05,385
Okay. So you...

182
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,097
You... Okay. I can just get a cab.

183
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,656
What are you doing this weekend?

184
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,242
- I was hoping on...
- There is this cool Chinese restaurant

185
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,911
that I wanna take you to, Shi Shan.

186
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,121
Chinese?

187
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:37,917
Yeah, but it's more than just egg rolls
and fortune cookies. Do you wanna go?

188
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,169
- When?
- On Friday night.

189
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:43,006
- I'll pick you up after work.
- No, it's... It's all right. I don't need a lift.

190
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:46,134
Or just meet there, then?
The show starts at 7:00.

191
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,304
- There's a show?
- A show, yes.

192
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:52,098
More than just a show.
The best spectacle in the world.

193
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,517
You'll love it. Prepare to be amazed.

194
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,019
Okay. Cool.

195
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:59,063
I'll get there early. I'll save you a seat.

196
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,648
- All right.
- All right?

197
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:08,531
- All right. Thanks for the ride, Jerry.
- All right. No problem, Fiona.

198
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,283
Have a good night.

199
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:34,474
I got a date with Fiona on Friday night,
from England.

200
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:38,102
Well, fuck me. I'm an asshole.

201
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,939
I apologize, man. You were right.

202
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,263
Cat food's in the kitchen, Jer,
and I can't open the can.

203
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,943
I don't have thumbs.

204
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:05,755
Who's my good boy? Who's my good boy?

205
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,512
- Hey, Jerry.
- Hey, Lisa.

206
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:13,680
- Hey.
- Alison.

207
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,223
- What's up?
- Where's Fiona?

208
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,725
She just left.
Do you have something for her?

209
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,270
Yes, she needs this address. Shi Shan.

210
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:24,440
- It's the restaurant where we're gonna meet.
- I'll make sure she gets it.

211
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,735
- Is there anything else?
- No.

212
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:30,780
Make sure she gets that, okay?
It's important.

213
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,281
- Yeah, we'll make sure.
- Okay.

214
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:40,331
- Is he gone?
- Yeah, he's gone.

215
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:44,002
- What is this about?
- It's this Chinese restaurant.

216
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,628
I said I might meet him over there.

217
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,922
No. You can't. Tonight's karaoke.

218
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:51,175
Yeah, karaoke. He'll get over it.

219
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:53,594
Well, just call him and tell him,
you can't make it.

220
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,596
No, I don't want to upset him.

221
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,975
I'll wait until the office closes and then
I'll leave a message on voicemail.

222
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,381
You're a real sweetheart, Fiona.

223
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,573
I got a girl named Li
She really drives me crazy

224
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,786
I got a girl named Li
She really drives me crazy

225
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:22,415
She got tiny feet and almond eyes

226
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,500
Long black hair and golden skin

227
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,627
She makes me want to scream

228
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:32,884
I got a girl named Li
She really drives me crazy

229
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,637
I don't want to lose you
This good thing

230
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:41,476
That I got 'Cause if I do

231
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,019
I will surely

232
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,481
Surely lose a lot

233
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,982
'Cause your love

234
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,120
- Like thunder
- Thunder

235
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:02,497
- Lightning
- Lightning

236
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,708
The way you love me is frightening

237
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:10,421
You better knock, knock, knock on wood

238
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,423
Baby

239
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,261
Hey, fish.

240
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:21,516
Hey, Jerry. How are you doing, man?

241
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,310
I'm a little bit bummed.

242
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:27,730
No, duh. She stood you up.

243
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,109
I'm sure there's a reason.

244
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:36,572
I sure hope so. I wish could help you, Jerry
but I'm just a fish.

245
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,908
For any MC in any 52 states

246
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:41,619
I get psycho killer Norman Bates

247
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:44,455
My producers slam
My flow is like, "Bam"

248
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:48,417
Jump on the stage and then I dip down

249
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,752
Oh, yeah

250
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,880
Oh, baby, I like it raw

251
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,485
- Jesus.
- Have you seen Alison?

252
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,571
No. I think she's gonna
keep going, actually.

253
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:17,738
Shit.

254
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,866
Now my phone's fucked.

255
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,577
No, it's all right.

256
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:26,831
- I was gonna walk back to the plant.
- No, I'll give you a ride.

257
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,958
- Yeah, okay.
- Thank you! You're the best.

258
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,626
- Okay, you ready?
- Okay.

259
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:31,961
- Go!
- Go.

260
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,424
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

261
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:40,261
It's so horrible!
It's like being in England again.

262
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,570
- You want me to wait?
- No, have a good night.

263
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,340
Bloody hell.

264
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,055
Shit.

265
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,267
Jerry!

266
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:11,936
Fiona?

267
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,689
Jerry!

268
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,576
Fiona. You're soaked. Get in.

269
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,705
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

270
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:33,582
What are you doing out here?

271
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,876
I was listening to music.

272
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,421
I went to Shi Shan. I didn't see you there.

273
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,173
Didn't you get my message?

274
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,720
No. No. No.

275
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,638
I am so sorry, Jerry.

276
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:57,231
You want a hot chocolate
or something?

277
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,651
I suppose I owe you, don't I? Go on then.

278
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,361
I'm freezing.

279
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,530
I... You're sitting on a blanket.

280
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,668
- Don't stare, Jerry.
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

281
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:19,234
- It's all right.
- I'm really sorry.

282
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:21,339
It's not the end of the world, Jerry.

283
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:28,387
God, I'm starving.

284
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,432
Let's get something to eat.

285
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:34,393
- I got crackers in the glove box.
- No.

286
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:37,938
We need something horrible
and greasy tonight. Do you know Doran's?

287
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:44,612
You gonna love it. It's this terrible, cheap,
all-night burger joint out by the county line.

288
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:46,364
- We go.
- And you wanna go there tonight?

289
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:51,369
Yes and yes. Full steam ahead, Captain,
and don't spare the chili.

290
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,578
Yeah. All right.

291
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:05,800
You know, they say a lot of things
about you up in accounting.

292
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:07,343
Like what?

293
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:11,097
Well, that arty chick Lisa,
she thinks you're hot.

294
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:15,476
And everybody else,
we just wonder where you're from.

295
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:20,356
My family moved here
from Berlin when I was seven.

296
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:25,444
You know, a kid's got to go
where his parents take him.

297
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:35,204
I don't even have that excuse.

298
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,375
Why do you live here then?

299
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:42,670
Oh, God. Well, if you find out, call me.

300
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:46,215
No, sorry.
No, that came out wrong, I'm sorry.

301
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:49,510
- You don't like Milton?
- No, no, no, it's... It's nice.

302
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:53,264
You know, the people are friendly.
It's pretty...

303
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:57,184
No. High-school football
and karaoke bars isn't enough.

304
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,020
I'm bored.

305
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:02,606
Insanely bored.

306
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:07,153
- You like heaven better, huh?
- Heaven?

307
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:08,195
What?

308
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:10,072
Where you're from.

309
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:11,991
Heaven?

310
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:16,745
Hardly. No, I'm from Reading.

311
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,914
Reading is a lot closer to hell.

312
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:24,670
You like trivia?

313
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:27,465
- Yes. Why?
- I got a good one, okay?

314
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:30,634
There is tons of angels in the Bible,
but only four of them have names.

315
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:33,846
Three of which
are Michael, Raphael and Gabriel.

316
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:36,599
Who's the fourth?

317
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,643
You're not getting all religious
on me, are you, Jerry?

318
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:43,189
No, I... This... This is fun.
Come on. Guess.

319
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:46,066
- Who's the fourth?
- I don't know. Freddy, the angel.

320
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:48,110
No, not Freddy. You know this.

321
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:52,072
You know his name, I promise you.
You're forgetting one thing.

322
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:56,535
You're forgetting that he's an angel.

323
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:22,603
Jerry, kill me. I wanna die.

324
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,731
Take your knife and cut my throat.

325
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:28,192
Don't worry, I'll help you.

326
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:29,276
What?

327
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,739
- No, no, Jerry! No! No!
- I got to do it, I got to do it!

328
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,326
Oh, my God.

329
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:46,001
The fourth angel is Lucifer.

330
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:52,091
- What?
- Lucifer is an angel. A fallen angel.

331
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,012
Fiona!

332
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,975
Fiona! He asked me to do it!

333
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,896
Fiona, don't run! You'll get lost!

334
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:13,404
Fiona!

335
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,074
You okay?

336
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,580
I don't know how that happened,

337
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:32,214
I'm sorry if I hurt you.

338
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,765
You're... You're in pain?

339
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:43,976
You're suffering.

340
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:50,691
I love you.

341
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,055
I'm so sorry.

342
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:24,308
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

343
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:26,352
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

344
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:27,936
I'm sorry.

345
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,158
- Hi, Jer.
- Not now, buddy.

346
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,578
What the hell you been doing?

347
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,527
It's okay, Bosco.

348
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:00,654
Pretty bad situation, buddy.

349
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,905
I know.

350
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:07,619
Maybe the best thing to do is just
go to the cops and explain everything.

351
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:08,871
Just tell them what happened?

352
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:10,831
Yeah.

353
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:16,545
I think you're right.
Be good to get it off my chest.

354
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,674
If I wait, it'll be a million times worse.

355
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:21,759
Thanks, Bosco.

356
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:24,845
You are both so fucking naive.

357
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,680
You go to the cops and you say,

358
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,683
"Hey, man, I accidentally
stabbed that English chick."

359
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:34,646
You think they'll all nod and understand
the way your stupid dog does?

360
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,940
- I don't know.
- Well, I do know.

361
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,651
They're gonna throw your ass in jail
where tattooed, meth addicts

362
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:42,362
will butt-fuck you daily
for 15 years to life.

363
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:46,950
You're a good man who made a mistake.
Nobody is gonna rape you, Jerry.

364
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,453
- But he did mean to do it.
- No.

365
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:51,872
Not the deer. That was an accident.

366
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,750
I'm talking about the girl.
You wanted to kill her.

367
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:57,503
- Never.
- Why'd you take the knife, then?

368
00:29:57,545 --> 00:30:01,089
Oh, my God. I'm evil.

369
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:03,967
No, you're not.
I've killed things on purpose, Jerry.

370
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,053
There's no shame in it. It's instinct.

371
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:09,389
The only time I felt truly alive
is when I'm killing.

372
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:12,226
The only time I've ever felt truly alive.

373
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,187
You see what I mean?

374
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:18,899
But you have to do something
about the body, Jer.

375
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,192
What about the body?

376
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:25,364
Well, some hiker stumbles across it,
and pretty soon it's CSI: Milton.

377
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:30,118
And guess whose hair and fiber
and spit and blood are everywhere?

378
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:33,622
Yours, Jerry.
Go get rid of the fucking body, dipshit.

379
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,374
I don't know.

380
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,460
I don't know.

381
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,088
I don't know.

382
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:11,178
- Hey, Jerry. How you doing?
- Hey, Sheriff Weinbacher. I'm good.

383
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,679
Really good.

384
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,681
What happened here?

385
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:20,354
A deer jumped in the window. It's horrible.

386
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:23,023
But you're okay?

387
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,191
Yeah.

388
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,922
Well, what did you do with the deer?
That's probably good meat.

389
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,990
I left it on the side of the road.
I shouldn't have done that.

390
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,076
I screwed up. I'm really sorry about that.

391
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:38,038
No, it was an accident. I'm not gonna
write you up for hunting out of season.

392
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:42,584
Thank you. Thank you, Sheriff Weinbacher.
I appreciate it.

393
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,462
No problem, Jerry.
You get that window fixed, okay?

394
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:47,547
Yeah, I'll do it right this afternoon.

395
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,884
- Cool. Drive safely, Jerry.
- You, too.

396
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:54,054
Hello?

397
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,558
Crap. That's... That's right now, isn't it?

398
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:01,186
Okay.

399
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:06,149
Yeah, no, I'm on my way. On my way.

400
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,368
Headaches?

401
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:20,080
- Trouble sleeping?
- No.

402
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,418
Suicidal impulses?

403
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:29,089
Do you hear voices?

404
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,842
I hear your voice, now.

405
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:33,468
Disembodied voices.

406
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:36,638
Voices that seem to be coming
from somewhere else.

407
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:37,973
Not really.

408
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:48,817
Jerry, do you find yourself
crying a lot lately?

409
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:53,196
- No.
- No?

410
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:59,703
Are you still taking the medication?

411
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:00,871
Usually.

412
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:05,459
You have to take it every day without fail.

413
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:07,044
I know. I know, but...

414
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:08,378
But what?

415
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:14,968
The medication, it smooths things out
and that's okay, right?

416
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,599
But even though there were bad moments...

417
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:22,976
- Very bad moments.
- Very bad.

418
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:27,814
There are also moments
of inspiration and beauty

419
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:30,484
when all the world makes sense,

420
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:33,737
and the elegant secret mechanics
of man and God are revealed

421
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:34,988
in their many dimensions,

422
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:39,284
and the universe is laid out
before mine eyes and it is a blessed place.

423
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:43,080
You totally stopped taking
the pills, didn't you?

424
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:46,708
- Totally.
- Thanks for your honesty, Jerry.

425
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,170
Our relationship depends
on the cooperation

426
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,880
of the Department of Corrections.

427
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:55,217
If you become non-compliant,
I have to report that.

428
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,470
And they'll put me away?

429
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:02,849
Let's not find out. Let's make you compliant.
Take the pills.

430
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:05,644
Okay. Okay. Let's not find out.

431
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:48,098
What's the matter, buddy?

432
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:52,602
- I really liked her.
- I know you did, buddy.

433
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:56,314
She's a good kid. I bet you miss her a lot.

434
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,066
Yeah.

435
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,986
I love you guys.

436
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,545
Don't take those pills, Jerry,

437
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:21,381
unless you wanna say goodbye
to your old friends.

438
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:24,342
I'm not sure it's a good idea
to be talking to your cat, anyway.

439
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:26,011
Yeah.

440
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:27,679
Or dog, either.

441
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:34,686
Take those drugs and you will enter
a bleak and lonely world, Jerry.

442
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,194
Jerry.

443
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:45,613
Jerry.

444
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,950
Hi, Fiona.

445
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,702
Look what you did to me.

446
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,912
I'm so sorry.

447
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,249
Friday, I had a pretty cushy gig.

448
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,460
Had lots of friends.
I was the office hottie.

449
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:03,590
Now I'm a severed head in a fridge.
Sucks to be me, Jerry.

450
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,926
What can I do about it now?

451
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:09,262
Take the meds, you useless wanker.

452
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:12,307
Take them. Take them!

453
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,073
See? That wasn't so hard, was it?

454
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:42,796
Mama!

455
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,301
- Mama!
- Jerry.

456
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:49,677
Mama!

457
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,638
Where are you?

458
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:53,640
Jerry.

459
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,810
- Pass him over.
- Come on.

460
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,144
Yeah, pass him over.

461
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,270
Yeah, I got him.

462
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,355
I love you, Jerry.

463
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:01,940
Bunny Monkey is my friend.

464
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:06,111
Bunny Monkey is not real.

465
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,156
Mom?

466
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,741
Dad?

467
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:17,497
You got to learn reality
from fantasy, Jerry.

468
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:18,748
You got to.

469
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,291
It's a sock.

470
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,544
- Be brave, Jerry.
- I love you, Bunny Monkey.

471
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,045
It's a...

472
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,463
No, don't listen to Mack.

473
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:28,049
...a fucking...
- Stay with me in my world, Jerry.

474
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,175
...sock!

475
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,344
Sock! Sock! Sock! It's just a sock!

476
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,180
A fucking sock!

477
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,474
I wish you were never born!

478
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:40,937
You and your mother,
you're fucking psychos!

479
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:38,036
Bosco? Hey.

480
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:47,003
Mr. Whiskers.

481
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,591
Say something.

482
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:55,595
Come on, say something.
Tell me to go "F" myself.

483
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:00,433
Don't leave me alone, come on.

484
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:07,125
Tally ho, Jerry.

485
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:08,835
Fiona, you're back.

486
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:10,962
Quite. And jolly well high time.

487
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,548
Bloody blooming right,
it's jolly well high time.

488
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:14,841
You look smashing.

489
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:18,970
- Those bleeding pills are rubbish.
- I super-hate those pills.

490
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:22,223
I only took them because you told me to.

491
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:29,314
Beastly drugs. They made me
look like a sodding jack-o'-lantern.

492
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,440
You know what?

493
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:35,653
And you were stinky, too.
But now you smell like...

494
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:39,032
You smell like baby shampoo.
You're beautiful.

495
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:43,286
Thanks, Jerry.
What a fab, cracking day to come back.

496
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:48,499
Perfect day. And I'm making
Honeynut Crunchys with 2% milk.

497
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:49,834
Hip, hip, hooray!

498
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:56,049
How's the cereal, chummy chum?

499
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,467
Delicious.

500
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:59,802
Scrummy. God Save the Queen.

501
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:02,555
Hey, Jerry? Jerry.

502
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:04,682
Can you get me a friend?

503
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:06,726
A friend?

504
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:09,312
I get so lonely in the fridge.

505
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:16,444
Like... Like kill someone on purpose?

506
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,404
By George, that's it.

507
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:20,406
Kill someone.

508
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:24,410
What about Lisa from accounting?

509
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:26,829
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

510
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,748
Please, Jerry.

511
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:32,168
Don't be such a nancy-boy about it.

512
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:33,419
Please?

513
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:36,923
I don't know.

514
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:40,051
- I love you, Jerry.
- I love you, too, Fiona.

515
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:41,427
I love you so much.

516
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:49,644
- You want some of my Crunchys?
- All right then, guvnor.

517
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:45,199
- Hey, Jerry.
- Hey, Mr. Kowalski.

518
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:47,285
I saw you on Friday.

519
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:51,330
- You saw me?
- Yeah, I saw you. You didn't see me?

520
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,623
No. I didn't see you at all.

521
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:54,167
You were at Shi Shan.

522
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:56,502
I saw you in the window,
eating beef chow mein.

523
00:45:56,670 --> 00:46:01,215
At the restaurant.
Yeah, it's my favorite, Shi Shan.

524
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,675
Thank you for seeing me.

525
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:05,261
I didn't do it on purpose.

526
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:09,348
No. I mean,
I'm just thankful for seeing each other.

527
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:13,728
- You okay, Jerry?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

528
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:16,689
- If you say so. See you, Jerry.
- Okay.

529
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:19,150
One more thing. Have you seen Fiona?

530
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:23,404
- Fiona?
- English Fiona. From the party.

531
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:26,532
No. What's up?

532
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:29,202
It's the end of the quarter.
We're trying to close out the books

533
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:31,120
and she's not answering her phone.

534
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:34,040
Plus, her car is still
in the factory parking lot.

535
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:38,628
That's sad. She was nice.

536
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:43,424
Maybe she went back to her own country.
She wouldn't need her car anymore.

537
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,426
I'm gonna miss her a lot.

538
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:53,726
Jerry.

539
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:58,731
That's good.

540
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,860
That's very good.

541
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:10,159
That's even better.

542
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:21,212
Jerry, change the fucking channel
before I explode.

543
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:24,882
That's more like it.

544
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,051
I feel so much better.

545
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,971
Jerry is back. Yeah. Fuck those pills.

546
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:32,431
That headshrinker
doesn't care if you're happy.

547
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:34,100
She just wants you to be obedient.

548
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:37,770
- She's not a bad person.
- Not if you want to be a slave to drugs.

549
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:39,355
Just say no. I do.

550
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:43,109
Check it out.
Crocodile killed a motherfucking antelope.

551
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:45,486
- It's a gnu.
- Yes, of course.

552
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:48,948
Are you gonna kill someone else?

553
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,617
Me? No. Of course not.

554
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:54,412
Sick, disturbed cat.

555
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:57,081
Why not, Jer? We both know you want to.

556
00:47:57,165 --> 00:47:59,584
- No.
- You killed by accident, that felt good.

557
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:03,713
Now do it on purpose, Jerry.
Just once. See what it's like.

558
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:07,216
Shut up. I don't have to listen to you.
You're just a cat.

559
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:11,178
Well, a cat that can talk and reason,
that's a miracle for the ages.

560
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,722
So what?

561
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:14,891
But a guy who talks to his cat...

562
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:17,018
Well, that's one step away
from the loony bin.

563
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:19,186
Find someone else. Kill them.

564
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:23,608
And you'll discover
what it feels like to be truly alive.

565
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:27,320
- By killing?
- It's better than sex.

566
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:31,657
He is wrong.
We're not like the pussy, Jerry.

567
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,743
- We have morals.
- That's a good boy.

568
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:37,121
Did you hear that? I earned
the right to be called a good boy.

569
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:39,957
You earned the right to
be hit by a minivan.

570
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:52,845
Knock, knock.

571
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:54,555
- Hey, Jerry.
- Hey, Lisa.

572
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:57,642
What's up, big guy?

573
00:48:57,684 --> 00:49:00,978
I was over here.
Just thought I'd see what you're up to.

574
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,440
- Same as always, you know.
- Yeah.

575
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:08,069
I'm trying to figure out
how to get out of here early.

576
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:12,031
Early? Shoot, man. It's past 5:00 now.

577
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:18,037
- Do you wanna get a drink?
- Yeah.

578
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:21,874
You wanna go to TGI Fridays?

579
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:24,477
Fridays kind of sucks on Tuesdays.
We could go to David's though.

580
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:26,837
- It's cool, you'll really like it.
- Good.

581
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,130
- Yeah.
- Okay.

582
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:31,550
You wanna... Now?

583
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:33,844
- Yeah, now, just...
- Yeah.

584
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,972
Yeah, if you're ready, I'll...

585
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:48,567
The divorce was final
in September or something.

586
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:53,614
I mean, it went like really quickly
because I basically agreed to everything.

587
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:56,909
You know, he got the house
and the car and I got the cat.

588
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:58,202
What kind of cat?

589
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:05,209
I don't know. Like a black and white...
It's a rescue. It's cute.

590
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:06,627
Are you good with cats?

591
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:08,713
No, the real question is,
are cats good with me?

592
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:11,966
Because they pretty much own us,
not the other way around.

593
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,759
Oh, my God, yeah.

594
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,136
- Right?
- You've got that right.

595
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:18,305
Yeah, I mean, if I don't give my cat
everything he wants,

596
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:19,640
it's just like, watch out!

597
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:21,684
Yeah, me too, me too, me too.

598
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:26,522
Yeah, I tried switching to dry cat food.
He was not having it.

599
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:28,441
No! He tore up my couch.

600
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:31,318
- I know. Serves me right, though. I guess.
- They're very demanding.

601
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:33,487
Yeah! What's your cat's name?

602
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:37,450
Mr. Whiskers. And he is a son of a bitch.

603
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:39,452
- How about you?
- Pighead.

604
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:42,955
'Cause that's what he is. A pig head.

605
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:45,916
- Pighead.
- He's so cute though.

606
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:47,460
- Yeah. Yeah!
- Do you wanna meet him?

607
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:49,962
He probably tearing up
my apartment right now.

608
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:53,591
- Now?
- Yeah?

609
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:55,468
Yeah!

610
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:56,802
Okay.

611
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:00,890
Yeah, okay. If you're okay to drive.
I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.

612
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:03,017
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay, I'll be right back.

613
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:35,633
I'm not

614
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:40,679
in the habit of going home with somebody
after one date, you know.

615
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:42,473
But...

616
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:46,268
Sometimes you just got to say
what the hell, I guess.

617
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:49,021
Yeah. You just gotta cut loose.

618
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:52,608
Actually, I'm that way, actually.

619
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:54,068
Can we go... Can we go somewhere else?

620
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:55,653
- Where?
- It's a surprise.

621
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:23,055
Where are we?

622
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,723
This is where I grew up.

623
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:28,894
It's beautiful.

624
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:31,063
- You think so?
- Yeah, it's so romantic.

625
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:33,232
What did you guys grow?

626
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,442
Nothing.

627
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:39,363
My stepdad had big plans,
but he was gone all the time with the Army.

628
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:43,868
- And my mom, she pretty much...
- What was she like?

629
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:47,037
German,

630
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:50,708
beautiful,

631
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:52,960
but mostly sad.

632
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:56,922
Why was she sad?

633
00:52:57,883 --> 00:53:01,594
He made her choose between
leaving him and leaving Berlin.

634
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:05,055
She spent the rest of her life homesick.

635
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,100
You okay?

636
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:15,107
That was my favorite window.
I spent a lot of time there.

637
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,611
You didn't have many friends?

638
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:20,946
Not really.

639
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:24,450
They called... The kids called me
Gesundheit and Fahrvergnügen

640
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,619
and The Ultimate Crying Machine.

641
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:29,872
- Kids are cruel.
- I know.

642
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:36,629
I used to sit there and look up

643
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:41,217
at the night sky and I'd make believe
that the stars were my friends.

644
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:44,470
It's stupid.

645
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:46,013
No, it's sweet.

646
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:25,177
They're coming for me, Jerry.

647
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:29,515
I'll stop them.

648
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:31,308
It's too late.

649
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:33,477
They already know. I told them.

650
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:35,646
What did you tell them?

651
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:42,403
I told them that sometimes I can hear
the secret conversations of the world.

652
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,364
Things no one else hears.

653
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:51,245
The animals, the angels talking to me.

654
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:55,749
Sometimes I hear them, too, Mom.

655
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:59,169
I know you do, Jerry.

656
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:04,383
Never tell anyone.

657
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:07,469
I told them and they won't let me alone.

658
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:10,347
Promise me you'll never tell. Promise.

659
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:12,808
- I promise.
- Never!

660
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:14,727
They don't understand.

661
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:16,729
They can't understand.

662
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:23,902
What's that sound?

663
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:30,868
It's the hospital people.

664
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:32,619
They have the Sheriff with them.

665
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,122
I can't go back.

666
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:37,541
I can't go back.

667
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:41,045
I can't go back. I can't go back.

668
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:02,900
Finish it.

669
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:07,112
Finish it. Finish it, please.

670
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:11,909
Jerry, finish it, please.

671
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,329
Please!

672
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:21,085
Jerry, finish it, please!

673
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:31,637
Jerry.

674
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:35,849
What is it?

675
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:43,148
My mama died up in that room.

676
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,616
- Sorry, I'm sorry.
- No, don't be. Hey.

677
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:56,912
It's okay.

678
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:06,797
It's just... I'm so sad.

679
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:33,699
Take me home, will ya?

680
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,926
- Hey.
- Thanks.

681
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:40,432
That was a wonderful night, Jerry.

682
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:42,726
I think so, too.

683
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:47,397
I'm really glad you asked me out.

684
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:49,775
Me too.

685
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:52,319
You're so mysterious, you know.

686
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:56,114
The first time you came up to accounting,

687
00:58:56,157 --> 00:58:58,075
I could tell there was something
deep about you.

688
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:06,959
You seem a million miles away.
What's on your mind?

689
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:11,630
This night turned out differently
than I was expecting.

690
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:15,676
Different, good?

691
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:16,927
Definitely.

692
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:19,972
I don't feel alone.

693
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:21,515
Me neither.

694
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:25,602
We have to get going.

695
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:30,190
- Work!
- Yeah.

696
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:32,150
I know. It seems like the last thing
I wanna think about.

697
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:34,903
I know. I gotta go home
and feed my cat and dog.

698
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:36,280
- They're gonna be furious with me.
- Yes!

699
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:38,782
- Do you want me to give you a ride?
- No, no, no, it's okay. I'll walk.

700
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:40,951
- Yeah?
- Yeah! Come up to accounting later,

701
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:43,995
just pretend you're delivering something.
We can make out in the copy room.

702
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:45,330
- I'll try.
- Okay.

703
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:47,833
- Bye.
- Bye.

704
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:51,420
- Bye.
- Bye.

705
01:00:11,232 --> 01:00:13,150
Who is a good boy?

706
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:15,352
- Who is a good boy?
- I want to smell her crotch, Jer.

707
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:16,528
Come, here. Hey, sit!

708
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:19,197
Where the fuck's my food, fuck-face?

709
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:22,701
That was the best night in my whole life.

710
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:25,746
Who's a good boy? Yeah.

711
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:30,876
Food!

712
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:33,879
- Hey, Mr. Whiskers.
- Food!

713
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:35,589
Now!

714
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:39,718
I left you a little gift on the sofa.

715
01:00:39,761 --> 01:00:42,554
A reminder why you can't
leave us alone without food.

716
01:00:55,693 --> 01:00:58,654
Jerry, hey.

717
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:00,572
Get me a friend!

718
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:03,241
- What's the matter, buddy?
- What am I supposed to do?

719
01:01:03,284 --> 01:01:05,535
- I do not know.
- Same as always.

720
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:08,455
- Pretend everything is fine.
- Really?

721
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:10,499
It got you this far, didn't it?

722
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:11,917
I guess so.

723
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:38,110
- Hey, Jerry?
- What?

724
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:41,321
They need you up in accounting.
Some problem with payroll or something.

725
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:42,531
Okay.

726
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:50,455
I found some irregularities in your records.
We need to do an audit.

727
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:51,832
- What?
- Come on!

728
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:56,294
- Close the door!
- Close the door.

729
01:01:58,089 --> 01:01:59,631
Come here.

730
01:02:06,931 --> 01:02:09,850
Thanks, Jerry. Jerry was just...

731
01:02:09,934 --> 01:02:12,310
Just faxed... Fixed the copier.

732
01:02:12,353 --> 01:02:13,854
I can make a copy later.

733
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:16,231
- I gotta go. I'm gonna go. Okay.
- Okay.

734
01:02:23,948 --> 01:02:25,449
Lisa, you dog.

735
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:28,994
Hey, are you still doing payroll?

736
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:31,329
Yeah, I'm a payroll lifer, why?

737
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:34,875
Can you give me Jerry's address?
I wanna bring him a gift or something.

738
01:02:34,959 --> 01:02:36,501
Like a whoopie cake. It's nothing.

739
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:38,587
Or you could just ask him.

740
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:41,548
I want it to be a surprise.

741
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:42,883
Please?

742
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:49,931
That's a lot of cheese sandwiches
to eat in one sitting! Forty one!

743
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:52,726
And that tiny Sonya Thomas always wins!

744
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:54,436
And now a grimmer story.

745
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:58,356
A woman murdered.
Her partial remains dumped in the woods!

746
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:00,525
- So sad!
- So terrible!

747
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:04,154
Reporter Sheila Hammer
has an Action One News exclusive.

748
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:05,989
The grisly discovery Tuesday,

749
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:09,367
near Milton, of an unidentified
female stabbing victim,

750
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:12,412
has local police on the hunt
for a serial killer.

751
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:14,289
- Jerry, you're a serial killer!
- Sheriff Weinbacher.

752
01:03:14,373 --> 01:03:15,540
No, he isn't.

753
01:03:15,666 --> 01:03:17,375
Now with the aid of the FBI,
we have developed

754
01:03:17,418 --> 01:03:19,920
a profile of the unknown killer.

755
01:03:20,004 --> 01:03:22,839
Male, late 20s or early 30s,

756
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:25,592
white, lower or middle class.
Trouble fitting in.

757
01:03:25,676 --> 01:03:28,720
That's you, Jerry. Can I have an autograph?

758
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:31,056
Will he kill again?

759
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:34,226
Well, if he's not stopped soon,
every indication is

760
01:03:34,268 --> 01:03:35,894
he will kill again.

761
01:03:36,729 --> 01:03:38,313
You hear that, punk?

762
01:03:38,397 --> 01:03:40,440
- No! No! No, no.
- You're a killer.

763
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:42,025
- God.
- A serial killer!

764
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:45,946
- I don't wanna be a killer.
- Too late, shitbag. There's no turning back.

765
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:49,032
You're a stone-cold murdering maniac.

766
01:03:53,454 --> 01:03:55,831
- Told you so.
- Told me so what?

767
01:03:55,915 --> 01:04:00,168
I told you you like killing.
And now the cops, they say the same thing.

768
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:01,586
Jerry!

769
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:06,091
Jerry!

770
01:04:09,595 --> 01:04:10,846
Jerry!

771
01:04:12,765 --> 01:04:15,183
- What they saying about you, love?
- That I'm a killer.

772
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:16,560
Take me out.

773
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,604
Let's talk about it.

774
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:21,022
What if I am?

775
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:24,401
- Serial killer?
- Yeah!

776
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:26,528
Well, is it something that you are?

777
01:04:26,612 --> 01:04:29,114
Like being brown-eyed or right-handed.

778
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:33,827
Or is it something that you choose?
Like being an accountant.

779
01:04:33,911 --> 01:04:36,705
- I wish I knew.
- You can still make the choice, Jerry.

780
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:37,873
You're still a good man.

781
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:41,126
I try to be a good man.
I wanna be a good man.

782
01:04:41,168 --> 01:04:44,129
- Then there's the cat...
- Fuck you, blaming it on me.

783
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:47,966
Hold on a second!
Look, I know what is good.

784
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:50,552
I know. I wanna lead
a righteous and just life.

785
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:52,556
I wanna be an upstanding member
of the community.

786
01:04:52,597 --> 01:04:56,224
But, you know, Mr. Whiskers,
he makes me do bad things.

787
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:59,019
The cat was nowhere near
when you killed me, Jerry.

788
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:01,479
See? See? Thank you, lady-head.

789
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:03,106
Okay. First of all, not true.

790
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:07,068
Second of all,
I know right from wrong, okay?

791
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:09,821
I know it. I try to be good.

792
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:11,448
But then certain

793
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:17,954
horrible things happened
and I am filled with...

794
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:21,416
With terror and dread,
standing outside of myself.

795
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:26,171
Even though I know what I've done,
I also feel like...

796
01:05:27,965 --> 01:05:29,090
Like it wasn't me.

797
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:32,802
Pretty complicated inside the human mind.

798
01:05:32,845 --> 01:05:36,264
It was you that killed me, Jerry. You.

799
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:39,684
Okay, that's true, but in a certain sense,
it wasn't me.

800
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:41,061
It was...

801
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:44,606
- You gonna say it was me?
- No, I wasn't gonna say that.

802
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:46,441
All right. Devil's advo-cat.

803
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:51,613
Let's say it was me, but you know that
I'm a talking cat. There's no such thing.

804
01:05:51,697 --> 01:05:55,033
Everything I say is really you.

805
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:57,619
- It's true, buddy. It's all you.
- What?

806
01:05:57,703 --> 01:05:59,913
Come on, Jer. You know that.

807
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:02,123
Your pets are spot-on, Jerry.

808
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:06,211
I kind of suspected that.

809
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:10,423
But if there's me,

810
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:14,719
you know, regular me, standing here,
the me who is talking now,

811
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:18,556
and I wanna be good.

812
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:20,934
Then there's you, you and you,

813
01:06:21,018 --> 01:06:23,770
trying to make me be something else.

814
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:26,856
- Am I good?
- No.

815
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:30,193
- You're bad.
- She's wrong. You're a good boy.

816
01:06:30,277 --> 01:06:32,904
They're both wrong. You are what you are.

817
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:34,364
That's it.

818
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:37,659
I am...

819
01:06:40,579 --> 01:06:42,789
- Someone's here! Intruder! Intruder!
- Bosco, Bosco!

820
01:06:42,873 --> 01:06:46,001
I got your back, Jerry!
I got your back, Jerry!
I got your back, Jerry!

821
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:47,168
Stay! Stay! Stay! Stay! Stay! Stay!

822
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:50,171
Just a second!
Just trying to put my dog away!

823
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:52,632
Hey, Jerry, is that my new friend?

824
01:06:53,926 --> 01:06:55,802
Jerry, I just need a whiff of her butt.

825
01:06:56,929 --> 01:06:57,929
Jerry!

826
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:00,682
Jerry!

827
01:07:03,894 --> 01:07:05,812
- Hey, Lisa.
- Hi, Jerry.

828
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:12,444
- Surprise, sorry.
- No, I'm so glad that you came.

829
01:07:12,486 --> 01:07:14,404
No, no. I'm imposing. I can tell.

830
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:16,364
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you!

831
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:18,908
I brought you some cakes.

832
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:22,287
You're amazing. Thank you for this.

833
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:24,956
There's four of them.

834
01:07:26,792 --> 01:07:30,295
Sorry, if... Do you have company?
Or am I interrupting?

835
01:07:30,337 --> 01:07:32,589
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Wait. Yeah, I...

836
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:36,843
It's just that... What you heard is
that I sometimes... I talk to my pets.

837
01:07:38,637 --> 01:07:40,346
- A lot of the time.
- No, me too.

838
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:43,391
All the time. And they sometimes talk to me.
Sometimes.

839
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:46,144
I get that.

840
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:49,314
- Thank you for the cake.
- Are you locked out?

841
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:51,316
It's okay.

842
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:56,029
I'll figure out how to get in somehow.
You don't need to stay around.

843
01:07:57,323 --> 01:08:00,950
And how are you gonna get in?

844
01:08:00,993 --> 01:08:02,660
There's a skylight.

845
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:04,662
I can totally get in through the skylight.

846
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:05,997
Really?

847
01:08:06,832 --> 01:08:09,501
You know, I'm pretty good
at getting in places.

848
01:08:09,543 --> 01:08:12,587
- I lose my keys all the time, so...
- I'm gonna use the skylight.

849
01:08:28,896 --> 01:08:30,814
Jerry, you okay?

850
01:08:30,856 --> 01:08:32,482
I'm fine.

851
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:34,359
- How are you?
- Fine!

852
01:08:35,027 --> 01:08:37,237
Jerry, I'm...

853
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:39,823
Jerry, I'm gonna just... Okay.

854
01:08:39,865 --> 01:08:43,034
Okay! Bye, Lisa! Thanks for stopping by!

855
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:53,837
Jerry! I got it open!

856
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:59,050
Hey! Hey, buddy.

857
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:03,513
Hey, Jerry! Jerry!

858
01:09:04,223 --> 01:09:07,267
Come on. Come on. No. No, no, no.
I don't wanna play. Come on.

859
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:12,856
Come on, come on, come on. Come on.
Okay, good boy, good boy.

860
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:21,257
Lisa.

861
01:10:21,508 --> 01:10:23,259
I told you I was gonna go
through the skylight!

862
01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:25,803
- Jerry, I'm sorry.
- Why would you...

863
01:10:25,846 --> 01:10:27,055
I apologize.

864
01:10:27,139 --> 01:10:29,807
...go through the door like that?
- I'm sorry, it's my fault.

865
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:31,601
- I'm just gonna go home.
- No, no, no, no.

866
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:33,978
Please. Please, please, please stay.
It's okay, okay...

867
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:37,315
She's the best thing
that ever happened to me!

868
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:41,277
- She's the best.
- Jerry, who are you talking to?

869
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,738
No, no. Wait, wait.

870
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:48,159
No! No, no, no, no.

871
01:10:48,327 --> 01:10:50,567
- Jerry, I'm just gonna go.
- No, I'm not gonna hurt her.

872
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:51,996
I'm not gonna hurt you.

873
01:10:52,164 --> 01:10:54,332
No, no, I'm not gonna hurt you, it's fine.
That's fine.

874
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:56,542
It's...

875
01:10:56,627 --> 01:10:58,795
- They're gonna hate me.
- No.

876
01:10:58,837 --> 01:11:00,713
No, no. Lisa, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

877
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:06,177
Lisa! Hey! Lisa? Please!

878
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:11,516
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, okay?

879
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:16,187
Please, open the door!

880
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:19,190
No!

881
01:11:19,733 --> 01:11:22,443
No! Lisa, come on.

882
01:11:34,456 --> 01:11:35,623
Lisa.

883
01:11:53,058 --> 01:11:54,267
Lisa?

884
01:12:02,776 --> 01:12:04,402
I'm gonna come in now, okay?

885
01:12:16,915 --> 01:12:19,208
I'm so, so sorry.

886
01:12:19,918 --> 01:12:21,919
Jerry, I won't tell anyone.

887
01:12:21,962 --> 01:12:24,881
I wish that you didn't have to see that.

888
01:12:24,923 --> 01:12:27,925
I just wish that we could
go back to the beginning, you know.

889
01:12:28,052 --> 01:12:29,260
We can.

890
01:12:31,096 --> 01:12:32,263
We can.

891
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:36,267
I'm really sorry.

892
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:40,396
- No, I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry I got scared earlier.

893
01:12:40,481 --> 01:12:43,274
I know. That was scary. I...

894
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:44,942
I didn't mean to scare you.

895
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:46,277
It's okay.

896
01:12:54,453 --> 01:12:55,703
I'm fine now.

897
01:12:56,205 --> 01:12:57,789
I know, I know. I know.

898
01:12:59,666 --> 01:13:01,084
And you hit me so hard.

899
01:13:02,669 --> 01:13:03,836
It's okay.

900
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:19,769
Are you okay?

901
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:21,896
Oh, God. I don't know how that happened.

902
01:13:24,566 --> 01:13:26,150
- I'm so sorry.
- Jerry.

903
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:31,322
I wanna go home.

904
01:13:34,868 --> 01:13:35,993
Jerry.

905
01:13:44,503 --> 01:13:48,047
It's okay. It's okay.
I know you are suffering.

906
01:13:48,132 --> 01:13:49,841
I'm gonna help you.

907
01:14:25,669 --> 01:14:29,046
Hey, you did what you had to do, Jerry.

908
01:14:30,174 --> 01:14:32,550
Figure it out in the morning.

909
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:39,390
It's okay, buddy. Everything...

910
01:14:41,935 --> 01:14:44,395
Everything's gonna be okay.
You're a good boy.

911
01:14:52,404 --> 01:14:53,404
What?

912
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:57,533
You want a piece?

913
01:14:58,076 --> 01:14:59,076
What?

914
01:15:00,621 --> 01:15:02,580
What? Want some of this?

915
01:15:12,132 --> 01:15:13,424
What?

916
01:15:22,768 --> 01:15:25,102
Our Father who art in heaven,
Hallowed be thy name.

917
01:15:25,145 --> 01:15:27,665
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.

918
01:15:27,731 --> 01:15:30,358
Make Jerry and Mr. Whiskers
and Bosco good boys. Amen.

919
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:35,530
Hey, Lisa, sweetie,

920
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:38,449
maybe give me a call
or a text when you get this.

921
01:15:38,492 --> 01:15:40,034
Hope you're okay.

922
01:15:40,118 --> 01:15:41,369
I can't reach her either.

923
01:15:41,495 --> 01:15:44,997
Are you guys watching the video
of the baby peeing on the senator?

924
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:48,292
No email, no Facebook updates.

925
01:15:48,335 --> 01:15:51,170
She was going out with that Jerry guy
from Packing and Shipping.

926
01:15:51,255 --> 01:15:52,964
I can't reach him, either.

927
01:15:53,006 --> 01:15:55,383
Jerry, the pizza guy? God, he's weird.

928
01:15:55,467 --> 01:15:57,677
- You heard the rumors, right?
- No.

929
01:15:57,761 --> 01:16:00,263
Go to the Tri-State Herald website.

930
01:16:02,307 --> 01:16:05,851
July 9th, 1997. Front page.

931
01:16:58,155 --> 01:17:00,406
Intruder! Intruder!

932
01:17:00,532 --> 01:17:03,492
I'll take your bullet for you, Jerry.
I'll take your bullet for you, Jerry.

933
01:17:04,578 --> 01:17:08,331
Don't pee yourself,
it's not the dog catcher. Unfortunately.

934
01:17:10,375 --> 01:17:11,417
What do we do?

935
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:14,211
Jerry, I got an idea.

936
01:17:21,762 --> 01:17:23,095
Hi, Jerry.

937
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:25,431
Hi, Alison.

938
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:42,531
- Hey, Jerry?
- Yeah?

939
01:17:42,574 --> 01:17:43,824
You remember last week

940
01:17:43,909 --> 01:17:48,245
when you said there was an invisible line
that separates good from evil,

941
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:49,330
and you thought you'd crossed it.

942
01:17:49,414 --> 01:17:51,454
And I said,
"No, no, no, no, no! You're a good boy!"

943
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:54,335
- Yeah, I remember. So what?
- I've changed my opinion.

944
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:58,255
So you think I'm evil, Bosco?

945
01:17:58,423 --> 01:17:59,757
I'm certain of it.

946
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:06,138
Welcome to my world, Jerry!

947
01:18:06,223 --> 01:18:08,265
I don't wanna be a part of your world.

948
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:11,852
You're already there.
Become what you're meant to become.

949
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:14,563
Fiona?

950
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:16,899
What do you think I should do?

951
01:18:17,901 --> 01:18:22,780
Well, you can't go back to work,
can't stay here, either.

952
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:27,910
I think it's time to see
if the cat knows what he's talking about.

953
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:29,161
She's right.

954
01:18:29,246 --> 01:18:32,623
- I totally agree.
- Well, meow to that.

955
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:35,209
Just go around killing people?
I like people.

956
01:18:35,293 --> 01:18:38,087
Aye. Fuck the dog.

957
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:40,256
Do it for the pleasure it brings.

958
01:18:40,298 --> 01:18:42,174
Come on, Jerry.

959
01:18:42,259 --> 01:18:43,926
We'll get a bigger fridge.

960
01:18:43,969 --> 01:18:46,929
- The first five are always the hardest.
- Don't listen to him, Jerry.

961
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:50,433
I don't know about you girls,
but that Jerry guy, he's going crazy.

962
01:18:50,517 --> 01:18:53,477
- He's losing it.
- He convinces himself it's all fine.

963
01:18:54,688 --> 01:18:56,480
Come on now. You can do it.

964
01:18:56,648 --> 01:18:58,065
I will vomit in my own mouth.

965
01:18:59,067 --> 01:19:01,067
...pretend you've been
taking care of Jerry. - Yes.

966
01:19:01,278 --> 01:19:02,653
I'm so bloody...

967
01:19:02,821 --> 01:19:05,197
- Of course.
- He's so sexy when he's dark.

968
01:19:05,323 --> 01:19:06,657
Who can tell he's crazy
just by looking at him?

969
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:07,867
This whole situation is kind of...

970
01:19:07,951 --> 01:19:09,351
- Stupid fridge!
- It smells like...

971
01:19:09,369 --> 01:19:10,369
You da man.

972
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:12,496
All these stupid talking heads...

973
01:19:12,664 --> 01:19:15,833
Shut up!

974
01:19:28,805 --> 01:19:29,889
Hi.

975
01:19:30,682 --> 01:19:31,974
Jerry!

976
01:19:34,186 --> 01:19:36,687
I got a lot going on right now.

977
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:38,939
What happened?

978
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:42,276
Well, I've been crying a lot.

979
01:19:43,153 --> 01:19:46,572
All the time.
And I stopped taking the drugs.

980
01:19:46,656 --> 01:19:48,240
What? Why?

981
01:19:49,242 --> 01:19:50,701
The cat made me do it.

982
01:19:51,328 --> 01:19:53,746
Your cat made you?

983
01:19:53,830 --> 01:19:56,165
No, no, kind of.

984
01:19:56,208 --> 01:19:59,084
I mean, Mr. Whiskers does the talking,
but it's really me.

985
01:20:00,045 --> 01:20:01,545
See? I'm making progress.

986
01:20:01,713 --> 01:20:03,506
It's not the cat! I know that now.

987
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:05,966
Jerry, we had an agreement.

988
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:07,426
I know. I'm sorry.

989
01:20:08,512 --> 01:20:11,347
Dr. Warren! I'm a bad person.

990
01:20:11,389 --> 01:20:13,432
Don't be so hard on yourself.

991
01:20:14,392 --> 01:20:16,644
I appreciate your honesty.

992
01:20:17,938 --> 01:20:22,900
I'm disappointed, but hey,
it's not like you killed someone.

993
01:20:25,946 --> 01:20:27,947
What, Jerry?

994
01:20:28,031 --> 01:20:29,865
It is kind of like that.

995
01:20:31,076 --> 01:20:33,285
Kind of like that times three.

996
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:38,290
What are you saying, Jerry?

997
01:20:39,709 --> 01:20:42,920
Three people who aren't alive anymore
because of me.

998
01:20:43,755 --> 01:20:46,173
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah. I know.

999
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:49,301
I feel terrible about it.

1000
01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:53,055
And I really need your help right now.

1001
01:20:53,098 --> 01:20:55,432
- I'll help you, Jerry.
- Thank you.

1002
01:20:55,475 --> 01:20:57,518
Go ahead. I'm listening.

1003
01:21:00,397 --> 01:21:02,898
Okay. You know the conga line?

1004
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:07,403
- At your company party. Yeah.
- Yeah.

1005
01:21:09,739 --> 01:21:12,408
Everybody sang A Happy Song.

1006
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:17,162
And you know that English girl, Fiona,
we conga-ed

1007
01:21:17,247 --> 01:21:19,331
and we were supposed to go to Shi Shan,

1008
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:21,292
see an awesome show and...

1009
01:21:22,794 --> 01:21:24,795
What are you doing, Doctor Warren?
Give me that.

1010
01:21:24,838 --> 01:21:26,672
- No!
- Sorry, wrong number!

1011
01:21:26,756 --> 01:21:28,966
- Help me! I'm being held hostage.
- It was an accident!

1012
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:31,635
I liked all of them
and wish they were all alive.

1013
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,304
But there's nothing
that I can do about that now.

1014
01:21:33,346 --> 01:21:34,847
Wait, do you have packing tape?

1015
01:21:34,931 --> 01:21:37,349
- What? Why?
- Because I can't let you go.

1016
01:21:37,434 --> 01:21:39,435
And I still need a lot of therapy.

1017
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:44,899
No! Stay there! You stay there now!
Back! Back!

1018
01:21:44,983 --> 01:21:48,235
Jerry, you're really upset right now.
Let's discuss this.

1019
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,821
- Okay.
- Stay calm. I understand.

1020
01:21:50,864 --> 01:21:53,824
Jerry, don't do this.
Don't do this, Jerry. No.

1021
01:22:05,879 --> 01:22:09,465
Okay. We haven't got a lot of time,
so we gotta get into the big issues.

1022
01:22:10,008 --> 01:22:11,050
Do you believe in God?

1023
01:22:12,385 --> 01:22:15,012
Me too. But I totally think
that he has it out for me.

1024
01:22:15,138 --> 01:22:17,473
He cuts everyone else slack
and then totally craps all over me,

1025
01:22:17,515 --> 01:22:19,850
and I wanna know why.

1026
01:22:19,893 --> 01:22:22,853
Why would he put a little boy
in a home with a father like that?

1027
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:26,098
Make my mother lose herself so completely
that she'd rather die than be with me?

1028
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:32,112
But if he is all-knowing,
God must be okay with me killing people.

1029
01:22:33,698 --> 01:22:35,366
A shrink who wants to talk.

1030
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:40,704
Good, if I un-tape you, we're going get on
the fast road to mental health, okay?

1031
01:22:40,747 --> 01:22:44,458
Hey, you start doing the silent shrink
thing and I can't predict what I'll do.

1032
01:22:47,462 --> 01:22:49,296
Now, why do I hear voices?

1033
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:54,885
A lot of people hear voices.

1034
01:22:54,928 --> 01:22:57,680
Or thoughts they can't stop.

1035
01:22:58,223 --> 01:23:00,015
- A lot of people?
- Yeah.

1036
01:23:00,767 --> 01:23:05,396
It might be a voice telling them
they're worthless or stupid.

1037
01:23:05,438 --> 01:23:09,441
Or it could tell them to
indulge every desire.

1038
01:23:09,526 --> 01:23:12,778
"Drink that drink." "Take that drug."
"Follow every sexual impulse."

1039
01:23:12,904 --> 01:23:16,407
Or it could be a cynical voice
telling them nothing matters,

1040
01:23:16,449 --> 01:23:18,617
that their efforts are insignificant.

1041
01:23:18,702 --> 01:23:20,244
You hear stuff like that?

1042
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:23,580
Yeah. I have thoughts.

1043
01:23:23,665 --> 01:23:27,793
Not exactly the same as you, but similar.

1044
01:23:27,877 --> 01:23:29,878
They tell me that I'm fat,

1045
01:23:29,921 --> 01:23:34,425
or psychotherapy is not
a worthwhile exercise.

1046
01:23:34,509 --> 01:23:36,051
That it's not real.

1047
01:23:36,094 --> 01:23:39,179
That I should have aimed higher
than a government job,

1048
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:41,849
that my potential is being squandered,

1049
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:44,601
that I'm unworthy of love.

1050
01:23:45,937 --> 01:23:49,440
But none of that is true.
So what do you do about it?

1051
01:23:51,192 --> 01:23:54,778
Well, I can't shut them off entirely,

1052
01:23:54,821 --> 01:23:59,116
nor would I want to,
but I can argue against them.

1053
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:02,786
Just because you have thoughts,
doesn't mean you have to act on them.

1054
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:07,791
You don't have to act on them?

1055
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:10,210
No!

1056
01:24:11,171 --> 01:24:16,300
Being alone in the world
is the root of all suffering.

1057
01:24:17,177 --> 01:24:20,679
But, Jerry, you are not alone.

1058
01:24:32,025 --> 01:24:35,277
See, that's like 10 years of therapy
in 10 seconds.

1059
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:43,243
Where are we going?

1060
01:24:43,328 --> 01:24:45,662
Home. I gotta feed my pets.

1061
01:25:04,182 --> 01:25:05,307
All right, let's go.

1062
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:08,727
No, no, no. You go inside,
I'll wait here and watch the road.

1063
01:25:11,523 --> 01:25:14,191
So that if I see him coming,
I can honk the horn

1064
01:25:14,275 --> 01:25:16,693
and warn you,
and then you can run back immediately.

1065
01:25:16,778 --> 01:25:18,779
You're a real hero, John.

1066
01:25:36,714 --> 01:25:38,173
Alison!

1067
01:26:29,642 --> 01:26:32,144
John, call the police. Call the...

1068
01:26:51,664 --> 01:26:53,123
Mr. Whiskers.

1069
01:26:54,125 --> 01:26:55,417
Bosco.

1070
01:26:56,628 --> 01:26:59,296
- Oh, my God, Jerry. What've you done?
- Please be quiet.

1071
01:26:59,464 --> 01:27:02,507
- Please be quiet.
- Let me go, for God's sake!

1072
01:27:02,592 --> 01:27:04,635
- Mr. Whiskers?
- What are you gonna do?

1073
01:27:04,677 --> 01:27:06,470
I told you, I don't know already.
All right?

1074
01:27:06,554 --> 01:27:07,971
Bosco!

1075
01:27:08,056 --> 01:27:09,598
What are you gonna do?

1076
01:27:09,724 --> 01:27:12,768
- What are you going to do?
- I told you, I don't know.

1077
01:27:12,810 --> 01:27:14,436
My pets are missing.

1078
01:27:20,777 --> 01:27:23,320
Jerry, let me go, for God's sake!

1079
01:27:25,531 --> 01:27:27,324
Everything's gonna be okay.

1080
01:27:47,971 --> 01:27:49,346
Mr. Whiskers!

1081
01:27:50,848 --> 01:27:52,182
Bosco!

1082
01:27:53,851 --> 01:27:55,435
Bosco!

1083
01:28:01,109 --> 01:28:03,860
Hey, loser. Is this the bitch
you've been fucking?

1084
01:28:04,195 --> 01:28:08,824
No! No! No! Mr. Whiskers.
That is my psychotherapist.

1085
01:28:08,866 --> 01:28:11,952
Great job she's doing.
You're the picture of mental health.

1086
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:14,246
- Where's Bosco?
- He got hit by a minivan.

1087
01:28:14,372 --> 01:28:16,206
- I'm lost without him.
- Good.

1088
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:18,917
Now you can kill her
without all his pathetic yelping.

1089
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:25,924
No, no, no, no. It's okay. It's okay.
I'm gonna... I'm gonna just do this.

1090
01:28:26,217 --> 01:28:27,509
Oh, God.

1091
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:30,095
- Jerry?
- Yeah.

1092
01:28:31,222 --> 01:28:32,306
I'm scared.

1093
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:33,598
She wasn't scared last week

1094
01:28:33,683 --> 01:28:36,351
when she threatened
to send you back to the loony bin.

1095
01:28:36,394 --> 01:28:37,602
Me too.

1096
01:28:40,231 --> 01:28:43,108
What can I do to make you
more comfortable?

1097
01:28:43,192 --> 01:28:45,819
- I want to make a phone call.
- She'll call the cops.

1098
01:28:45,903 --> 01:28:47,070
You'll call the cops.

1099
01:28:47,155 --> 01:28:50,907
No, no, no! I just don't wanna be alone.

1100
01:28:54,746 --> 01:28:57,914
Stay right there. Hold on.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1101
01:28:59,751 --> 01:29:01,418
You don't have to be alone.

1102
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:04,004
Here, here, here.

1103
01:29:09,761 --> 01:29:13,430
Mr. Whiskers! Dr. Warren!
Fiona! Cut it out!

1104
01:29:16,142 --> 01:29:17,642
Mr. Whiskers!

1105
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,125
Hey.

1106
01:29:43,878 --> 01:29:47,255
You did the best that you could.
It's not your fault.

1107
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:50,967
What are you gonna do to me?

1108
01:29:51,052 --> 01:29:54,054
Nothing. Nothing.

1109
01:29:54,138 --> 01:29:55,389
It's fine.

1110
01:30:04,357 --> 01:30:07,984
Put me the fuck down,
you goddamn psycho. I'll shit in your hand.

1111
01:30:10,655 --> 01:30:11,988
The suspect's car is in the parking lot.

1112
01:30:12,073 --> 01:30:14,032
- Here. Here.
- I want you two on the right.

1113
01:30:14,117 --> 01:30:16,317
Fan out and spread around the building.
Cover all exits.

1114
01:30:16,327 --> 01:30:17,786
All right, keep low, guys.

1115
01:30:19,622 --> 01:30:21,415
Round the back, round the back.

1116
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:38,682
Is this your brilliant escape plan, Jerry?

1117
01:30:39,725 --> 01:30:42,519
Sneak out the back door.
It's your favorite door, isn't it?

1118
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:44,146
It's the best I've got.

1119
01:30:51,028 --> 01:30:55,323
That's good, Jerry. This will fool them,
since you are bulletproof and invisible.

1120
01:30:57,452 --> 01:30:58,785
Run, Jerry.

1121
01:30:59,579 --> 01:31:01,455
It's been nice knowing you, pal.

1122
01:31:20,057 --> 01:31:21,417
- Sheriff's department.
- I'm here!

1123
01:31:21,434 --> 01:31:23,101
- Nobody move.
- Don't hurt me!

1124
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:25,729
I smell gas.

1125
01:31:27,023 --> 01:31:28,607
Can't you smell that?

1126
01:31:28,941 --> 01:31:30,108
We'll check on it.

1127
01:31:30,193 --> 01:31:32,194
- Where did Jerry go?
- He went in there.

1128
01:31:32,236 --> 01:31:34,404
Suspect last seen in the bathroom.

1129
01:31:35,448 --> 01:31:36,907
- Was he armed?
- I don't know.

1130
01:31:39,869 --> 01:31:41,495
I found a cat.

1131
01:31:56,260 --> 01:31:57,719
Jerry.

1132
01:32:01,432 --> 01:32:03,099
Hey, we found a cat and a dog.

1133
01:32:03,184 --> 01:32:05,227
- Call the animal shelter.
- Are you okay?

1134
01:32:06,771 --> 01:32:09,091
We believe he's in the bowling alley.
You think he's armed?

1135
01:32:09,106 --> 01:32:10,273
I don't know.

1136
01:32:10,358 --> 01:32:12,108
Then we have to assume he is.

1137
01:32:12,276 --> 01:32:15,278
Please don't hurt him. He's very ill.

1138
01:32:15,404 --> 01:32:18,490
Our first priority is
our own safety, Doctor.

1139
01:32:23,621 --> 01:32:25,455
Tactical team on scene.

1140
01:32:26,290 --> 01:32:28,542
First responders, clear.

1141
01:32:28,626 --> 01:32:30,210
Bedroom, clear.

1142
01:32:37,051 --> 01:32:38,260
Go! Go!

1143
01:32:38,469 --> 01:32:40,262
Preparing to descend.

1144
01:32:43,307 --> 01:32:44,558
Gas leak!

1145
01:32:51,232 --> 01:32:52,774
Jerry.

1146
01:32:52,942 --> 01:32:54,651
Jerry.

1147
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:57,487
Jerry, you're almost home.

1148
01:32:57,572 --> 01:33:00,115
Come home, Jerry.

1149
01:33:00,157 --> 01:33:01,658
Come. Come with us.

1150
01:33:03,119 --> 01:33:04,661
Come, Jerry.

1151
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:07,706
We are all waiting for you.

1152
01:33:07,957 --> 01:33:11,126
Come. You will never be alone anymore.

1153
01:33:11,168 --> 01:33:15,505
Come home, come.
You will never be alone again.

1154
01:33:16,215 --> 01:33:18,049
Jerry, come.

1155
01:33:18,384 --> 01:33:19,509
We're waiting for you.

1156
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:21,052
Jerry.

1157
01:33:35,568 --> 01:33:39,779
Well done. As in, you're going to be
char-broiled, Jerry. You run.

1158
01:33:39,864 --> 01:33:42,824
No! You stay.

1159
01:33:42,867 --> 01:33:45,493
You're no good to yourself or anybody else.

1160
01:33:45,536 --> 01:33:47,370
You let the fire put you to sleep.

1161
01:33:47,455 --> 01:33:51,416
"Put you to sleep." Isn't that what
they say right before they kill you?

1162
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:52,751
Jerry knows that.

1163
01:33:52,835 --> 01:33:54,961
He can end the suffering tonight.

1164
01:33:55,046 --> 01:33:58,673
Unless you want to be
Jerry the Human Torch, get the hell out!

1165
01:33:58,716 --> 01:34:01,176
Stand your ground, buddy!

1166
01:34:01,218 --> 01:34:03,470
There's nothing left for you in this life.

1167
01:34:19,028 --> 01:34:22,739
We could have filled
10 more refrigerators, Jerry.

1168
01:34:22,782 --> 01:34:24,282
Shush, pussy.

1169
01:34:24,367 --> 01:34:28,244
If he survives he'll only cause
more suffering, pain and death.

1170
01:34:29,121 --> 01:34:32,290
It's over. Jerry's going home.

1171
01:34:48,224 --> 01:34:49,599
You win, pup.

1172
01:34:50,643 --> 01:34:53,311
I have to confess,
this alpha thing suits you well.

1173
01:34:55,189 --> 01:34:56,981
I kind of like you, Bosco.

1174
01:34:57,900 --> 01:34:59,734
Me, too.

1175
01:34:59,777 --> 01:35:01,444
I like you, Mr. Whiskers.

1176
01:35:02,947 --> 01:35:06,157
But now, it's time for each of us
to go our own way.

1177
01:35:07,451 --> 01:35:10,286
- Goodbye, friend.
- Goodbye, Mr. Whiskers.

1178
01:35:23,342 --> 01:35:24,968
- Mom?
- Hey, Jerry.

1179
01:35:25,052 --> 01:35:26,386
- Dad?
- Creep.

1180
01:35:27,930 --> 01:35:30,014
Hey, Fiona! Lisa!

1181
01:35:30,099 --> 01:35:31,975
- Good evening, love!
- Hi, Jerry!

1182
01:35:33,936 --> 01:35:36,354
- Alison?
- Hey, Jerry!

1183
01:35:36,439 --> 01:35:38,732
I'm sorry I killed you guys!

1184
01:35:38,816 --> 01:35:41,526
Let's not bring up the bad things.
Let's just be happy.

1185
01:35:48,743 --> 01:35:51,202
- Jesus!
- Hi, Jerry.

1186
01:35:51,287 --> 01:35:53,496
Thanks for the love
and thank you for coming.

1187
01:35:53,581 --> 01:35:55,165
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

1188
01:35:55,332 --> 01:35:58,168
- Are my pets going to be okay?
- You betcha!

1188
01:35:59,305 --> 01:36:59,454
