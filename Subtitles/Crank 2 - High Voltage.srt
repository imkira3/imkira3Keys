1
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:38,972
In a story so bizarre...

2
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,600
...I can scarcely believe
the events I'm reporting...

3
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,019
...and yet corroborated
by a dozen eyewitnesses...

4
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:46,313
...a white male apparently fell
from the sky...

5
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,357
...above downtown
Los Angeles today...

6
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,818
...landed in the middle
of a busy intersection...

7
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:54,029
...destroying one vehicle
and hospitalizing its elderly driver...

8
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,906
...and was removed from the scene...

9
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,158
...before emergency personnel
could respond.

10
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:01,662
Without a body, the police have yet
to piece together events of a day...

11
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,665
...that can only be described
as implausible.

12
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,334
Reports of a body
landing in the Boyle Heights area...

13
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:10,129
...have yet to be confirmed,
and are being treated...

14
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,297
...as the bullshit they most likely are.

15
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,647
You big cock English.

16
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,649
Strong like horse.

17
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,809
Fuck that.

18
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,560
That's not so bad.

19
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,394
Nice.

20
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,699
Pick up, Eve.

21
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,161
The number you have reached
is not in service.

22
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,663
Fuck.

23
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,625
Shit.

24
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,713
You lost?

25
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:05,966
Nope.

26
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:16,830
Shit.

27
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,213
On your knees, Slim.

28
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:30,926
Okay, Chow Mein.

29
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,512
- Who do you work for?
- Fuck you, Chelios.

30
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,392
Fucking grunt.

31
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,079
You found me in quite an unpleasant
mood this morning, mate.

32
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,249
Now, I'm gonna ask you this question
one time.

33
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,752
Who's gots my fucking
strawberry tart?

34
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,675
Capiche?

35
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,348
Just spit the fucking name out.

36
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:19,933
Johnny Vang!

37
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:23,645
Johnny fucking Vang?
Johnny fucking Vang?

38
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,481
- Good boy. Where?
- Cypress Social Club!

39
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,609
Cypress- Cypress Social Club.

40
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:32,237
Now, you're sure about that, ain't you?

41
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,447
Good boy. Thanks for coming.

42
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,366
Now, you can keep that.

43
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,018
Fuck.

44
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:01,868
Hello. Doc Miles.

45
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:03,953
Yeah, Doc, it's Chev.

46
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,123
Jesus H. Chelios.

47
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,541
You gotta be kidding me.

48
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,585
Listen. I'm deadly
fucking serious, Doc.

49
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,213
These Triad motherfuckers
cut out my fucking heart...

50
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,382
...and put in one of those
artificial jobs.

51
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:17,550
You got an artificial heart?

52
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,804
You think I'm having a fucking laugh?

53
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,223
No, but you gotta admit,
it's a little out there.

54
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,810
- You take your fucking time, Doc.
- You don't have any time.

55
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:30,313
They're not designed to keep you alive
more than a couple of days.

56
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:33,400
- And don't do anything strenuous.
- Yeah, sure, Doc. No problem.

57
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,026
So, what's my next fucking move?

58
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,904
We gotta get a real heart put in you,
preferably your own.

59
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,614
- I'm on it.
- Okay, you're on it.

60
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,742
- Doc, Jesus fucking Christ!
- I'm sorry. Sorry.

61
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,079
Let me- Does that thing
have a belt battery pack?

62
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:49,207
- Check.
- How many bars are showing?

63
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,377
- One.
- Shit. That's better than none, I guess.

64
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:56,172
Look, what they did you with
is an Avicor Total Artificial Heart.

65
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,761
It's got an internal battery that'll
pick up once the belt battery dies.

66
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,596
It's like a reserve tank.

67
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:07,517
Once the internal battery takes over,
you got one fucking hour.

68
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,602
The internal battery
charges wirelessly...

69
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,355
...through a transcutaneous
energy-transfer system.

70
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,358
Two coils-
There's one internal, one external.

71
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:18,194
- that transmit via a magnetic force
across the skin...

72
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,363
...without piercing the surface.

73
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:23,825
The internal coil receives power
and sends it to the controller device.

74
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,578
Does this make any fucking sense
to you, Chevy?

75
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,038
It's fucking Greek, Doc.

76
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:31,082
Greek.

77
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,752
Look, you gotta keep your body
electrically charged...

78
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,463
- ... to keep that piece of shit pumping.
- Copy that.

79
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,256
- Hey, Chev?
- Yeah.

80
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,634
- I'm stoked you're alive, dude.
- I'll get back to you, Doc.

81
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:42,886
Yeah. Call me.

82
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,140
Fuck.

83
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,310
Hey, hey, hey! That's a nice car.

84
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,438
Don't suppose you know where
the Cypress Social Club is, do you?

85
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,483
Man, fuck that shit, puto.
Let's race, ése.

86
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,235
Don't you tempt me, fucker.

87
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,821
What I need from you is directions.

88
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:33,572
Shit.

89
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,630
Damn, dog. You good, ése?

90
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:03,466
Tiger fucking Woods.

91
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,718
Never better.

92
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,512
Greatest day of my fucking life.

93
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:17,063
You couldn't point me in the direction
of the Cypress Social Club, could you?

94
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,440
Well, you ain't too far.

95
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:22,944
Go down Orange for, like, 2 miles,
and then you're there, homes.

96
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,992
You mind giving me a jump?

97
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,544
Just juice me.

98
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,052
Anybody know
where's the fucking Social Club?

99
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:36,142
Donde esta la Social Club?

100
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:45,234
Buenos nachos, white boy.

101
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,658
This is a fucking social club?

102
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,502
You Johnny Vang?

103
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,336
Go.

104
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,869
- Get lost, bitch.
- Fuck you.

105
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,874
- What?
- Where's Johnny Vang?

106
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,876
You looking to get your ass killed?

107
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,672
- Wrong expression.
- You ain't tapping my ass.

108
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,011
There you go, cupcake.

109
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:42,101
Fucking no balling
for me today, thanks.

110
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:44,937
There goes my ride!

111
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,777
What is that? Fucking cunt-onese?

112
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,905
I'd rather stick my dick in a blender.

113
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:56,949
Sticky me.

114
00:17:58,744 --> 00:17:59,952
Hey!

115
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,218
- Johnny Vang?
- Yes.

116
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,469
Where?

117
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,981
Hey, dude, why do you run?

118
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,650
Wait for me!

119
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:33,986
Get out of the fucking car!

120
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,742
- Out!
- Get your own station wagon, asshole!

121
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,328
Get the fuck off!

122
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,664
Damn.

123
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,166
Fuck.

124
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,794
You taking it too fast with me.

125
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,755
- Which way?
- I want you to take it slow.

126
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,507
Which way?

127
00:18:58,345 --> 00:18:59,679
Hey! Hey.

128
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,848
You didn't ask name.

129
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,852
Shut up a minute, for fuck's sake.

130
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,146
Where is he?

131
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,190
- Johnny Vang?
- Yes.

132
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,153
Motherfucker!

133
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,122
Baby.

134
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,187
Motherfucking Chelios!

135
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,360
You like sushi, Chinese man?

136
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,248
How the fuck am I supposed
to know what kind of "ese" you is...

137
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,417
...you slanty-eyed fuck?

138
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,419
Check it out.

139
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,296
Sushi.

140
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,440
Hey, Chico.

141
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,404
We can make a deal, huh?

142
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,162
Oh, yeah.

143
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,289
Come on. Come on.

144
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,133
My girl.

145
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,389
Eve.

146
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:11,936
Eve?

147
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,334
Here, baby.

148
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,844
Eve?

149
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,808
Chev?

150
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:57,189
Hey, I need you to take your
fucking hands off Lemon now, man.

151
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:59,442
- Who the fuck are you?
- Who the fuck am I?

152
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:02,028
Who the fuck are you?
You know this guy, Lemon?

153
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,030
Lemon.

154
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,782
You were dead.

155
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:09,869
I'm-

156
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,163
I'm so confused right now.

157
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,832
- What's that ticking sound?
- Yeah, what is that sound?

158
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,002
You're kind of weird, tick-man.
It's time for you to go.

159
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,049
- Randy?
- Randy?

160
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:25,009
Come here.

161
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,074
Not you. Babe, it's-

162
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:49,367
Who the fuck is that?

163
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:51,327
Some whore.

164
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,954
Fuck, no. Fuck.

165
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,999
- Look, she's helping me find my heart.
- What?

166
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:59,335
Go away. Come on, let's go.

167
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:02,755
Baby.

168
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:05,591
What?

169
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,765
Oh, you dozy cunt.

170
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:14,809
Baby-

171
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:24,110
No.

172
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,112
We need his ass alive.

173
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:29,448
Chev Chelios,
let's save some bullets, dude.

174
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,617
Put that away.
We've all had a drink.

175
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:32,910
Should I duck?

176
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,745
Yeah.

177
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:35,681
Shall we bypass the formalities?

178
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,850
Of course.

179
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:41,520
Who do you work for, and what
the fuck do they want with me?

180
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:42,980
El Huron.

181
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:46,275
English. Who's the fucking El Huton?

182
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,486
It's The Ferret.

183
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:54,200
He wants you alive,
so he can watch you die.

184
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:56,202
Oh, yeah?

185
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:58,871
- Why?
- I don't know.

186
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,998
Doesn't everybody?

187
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,918
Shut up.

188
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,795
You lucky bastard.

189
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,556
Eve, let's go.

190
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,656
Get on the floor now!

191
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,246
Turn around.

192
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:47,670
Oh, it's on now.

193
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:51,423
- No! Stop! Stop!
- Put her down.

194
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,355
Stop it!

195
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:07,690
No!

196
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:03,996
Why didn't you call me?

197
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:07,374
Like fuck I didn't.
Didn't you get my message?

198
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,796
No. Where have you been
for the last three months?

199
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,048
I thought you were dead.

200
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:16,967
I fell a mile out of a helicopter,
that's all. True story.

201
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,762
No way. You know what?
That's totally possible.

202
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:21,513
I saw this video on YouTube...

203
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:24,850
...where this guy's parachute doesn't
open, he falls 14,000 feet...

204
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,143
...and he lives.

205
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:30,230
Yes, baby, I know it's possible,
because I fucking did it!

206
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:32,733
- Quit it.
- Since when were you on the Internet?

207
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,027
A lot of things have changed
since you died.

208
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,820
I didn't fucking die.

209
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,990
Well, that's besides the point, isn't it?

210
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,701
Hey!

211
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,920
- Where are we going, Chev?
- I don't know.

212
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:56,215
I need to find that slob from the club,
the one with the red cooler.

213
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,467
Are you talking about Johnny Vang?

214
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:15,651
- You know Johnny Vang?
- I know his ass.

215
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,237
He's got the box with him all the time.

216
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,988
That box, I need it.

217
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:24,702
I can bet on my grandma's coochie
he's at the horse track.

218
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:30,040
Dude, you gonna put Johnny Vang
on ice?

219
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:33,919
- Maybe.
- That's so fucking sexy.

220
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:38,924
- Fucking dead.
- Didn't they cuff you?

221
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:43,512
Damn it. Do me.

222
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,764
I'll do you.

223
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:50,561
Bitch.

224
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:55,107
Atta girl. I gotta call Doc.
I need that cell phone.

225
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,277
Why didn't you just say it?
I have a cell phone.

226
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,195
Here.

227
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,536
You got a cell phone.

228
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:10,038
I got you, okay?

229
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:12,291
You gotta work for the things that-

230
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:15,002
- Chevy?
- I lost the belt battery, Doc.

231
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,879
- How long ago?
- Over an hour.

232
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:20,132
Jesus Christ. That's not fucking
possible, Chevy. You should be d-

233
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,759
Fuck it. Never mind. Look.

234
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:25,345
It's a wireless system, so any low-level
electrical shock to your skin...

235
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:27,598
...should juice it at least temporarily.

236
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,767
Hey, Chev?
I'm a certified heart surgeon.

237
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,393
Well, I was.

238
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:34,021
Lost my license after I fucked up
my ex-wife's...

239
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,939
...vaginal rejuvenation procedure.

240
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,399
That's irrelevant right now.

241
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:41,278
The point is, if you can get your heart,
I'm sure I can put it back in for you.

242
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:45,407
I'll be in touch when I find that Chinese
cocksucker that's got me pump.

243
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,495
Bet you even had
to choose between-

244
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:51,330
Chinese.

245
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:55,167
Sharon, I just shut down, okay?
I couldn't think. I couldn't feel.

246
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:59,171
Hey, Chocolate? Would you get
off your fat ass and get dressed?

247
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,257
Why?

248
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,345
Is Doc Miles gonna
have to choke a bitch?

249
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:09,973
You know that I was waiting
for those results too?

250
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:13,936
- I needed to put things in perspective.
- Oh, you needed? You needed?

251
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:16,814
I think I know who we're dealing with.

252
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,316
Hell no, we won't blow.

253
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,568
Hell no, we won't suck.

254
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:23,904
Hell no, we won't blow.

255
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,990
Hell no, we won't suck.

256
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,455
Move! Jesus. Shit.

257
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,042
What the fuck!

258
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,544
Shit.

259
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:41,296
That's right. You're gonna pay me!

260
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:42,714
We want to make a living.

261
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:45,717
You carry weapons,
we carry weapons in our pants.

262
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:47,219
We're sick and tired of this.

263
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:49,805
Pay me my fucking wages,
motherfuckers.

264
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,682
Dropping loads
all over your silly wages!

265
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,058
They need their money.

266
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:57,729
You want me to fuck this car?

267
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,483
- Suck my fucking tits.
- Get off the car.

268
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:04,486
I'm gonna bang that bitch
in the back.

269
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:07,239
- Hi.
- Give me my money.

270
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:08,740
We're sick and tired of this.

271
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:11,535
Just because it's porn
doesn't mean we don't wanna do it.

272
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:15,247
This is a weird scene. We've got
pissed-off beaver. I'm in pursuit.

273
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,140
Cunt.

274
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:39,688
Sit.

275
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,398
Good-

276
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:45,694
- I'm just making sure.
- He's doing what he's supposed to.

277
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,696
Well, he's gotta know who's in charge.

278
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,114
Dude, come on.

279
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,575
- He's gonna eat somebody's baby-
- Chill.

280
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,411
- You're gonna get sued.
- He's doing what he's supposed to.

281
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,246
Whatever. I wanted a cat.

282
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,873
Fuck.

283
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:05,130
- See? Way better than a cat, man.
- Whatever.

284
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,299
Who's this fucking asshole?

285
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,968
You pair of sausage noodles.

286
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:12,262
How do you sleep at night?

287
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,140
I'm from PETA.
This is animal cruelty, you fuckers.

288
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:18,143
- Give that back, you liberal freak.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

289
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:20,812
- Fucking shame on you two. I tell you.
- That's $250.

290
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,231
- Pair of cunts. Press the button.
- Take it back.

291
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:24,942
- Hit him.
- Listen-

292
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,070
- Disgusting.
- Morning.

293
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,905
Mom would be so proud.

294
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:32,658
- Sorry about that. Give me that thing.
- No.

295
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,662
Yeah, there you go. Go on.

296
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,666
You don't press that button,
you're going.

297
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:43,001
- I'm pressing it.
- Press it!

298
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:46,088
Come on, what's the matter?
Fucking wake up.

299
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:48,966
- Make him press the button, you-
- Give him the fucking-

300
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:54,096
- What are you, fucking useless?
- Hey!

301
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:56,014
Stop right there!

302
00:32:58,851 --> 00:32:59,851
Oh, shit.

303
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,647
See? He lost it. I told you.

304
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,530
Get him off!

305
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,785
Will our insurance cover that?

306
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:25,210
- Get down!
- Cover your head!

307
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:28,380
- On the ground!
- What the fuck is around your neck?

308
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,969
Are you fucking kidding me?

309
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:41,018
Kaylo?

310
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:44,521
- Get on.
- Both of you down on the ground now!

311
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,198
Kaylo, I thought you were dead.

312
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,826
My name's Venus. I'm from Hollywood.

313
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,246
Kaylo was my brother.

314
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:15,177
Brother? No shit.

315
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,637
Hey, what the fuck
did you hit me for anyway?

316
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:21,433
I have a condition.
FBT, Full Body Tourette's.

317
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:22,642
I can't control myself.

318
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,896
Jesus! Fuck!

319
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,273
God! What the-?

320
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:32,110
Motherfuck.

321
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:36,281
Hey, listen.
I'm sorry about your brother.

322
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:38,742
I need to get to the
Hollywood Park racetrack...

323
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,619
...and I mean right the fuck now.

324
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:48,293
What's the matter,
you hurting or something?

325
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,634
- Is that where they're at?
- Who?

326
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:59,012
The sucker that killed my brother.
You're Chev "the cheese" Chelios?

327
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:02,307
The sickest motherfucker that ever
vaporized a motherfucker, right?

328
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:06,853
- Yeah. That's me.
- Yeah. So when you get those suckers-

329
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:10,565
Get a grip of yourself.
It's already done.

330
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:12,484
It's done.

331
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:15,612
I already took care
of the ones that did Kaylo.

332
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:19,074
- But- All of them?
- All of them.

333
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,451
D- E-A-D. Brown Bread.

334
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,745
- Right Said Fred?
- Simply Red.

335
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,497
I see.

336
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,166
Don't look so gloomy, Elvis.

337
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:30,794
I can assure you
they did not die pleasantly.

338
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,004
No. You don't understand.

339
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,840
It's a matter of honor.

340
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:37,676
It should have been me
to avenge my brother's death.

341
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,846
Well, so long, Chelios.

342
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,307
My brain hurts.

343
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:48,770
There is one that I never got to,
on account of I could never find him.

344
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:51,857
- The one that calls himself The Ferret.
- El Huron?

345
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:54,067
- You know him?
- No.

346
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:57,988
- That means "the ferret" in Spanish.
- Right. Yeah, I knew that.

347
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,658
Listen, you want to find the dude that
made your brother dead, you find him.

348
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,872
Chev?

349
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:10,292
Racetrack.

350
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,045
You're here.

351
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,334
That you, Chelios?

352
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:56,338
- I'm running on empty, Doc.
- Same here, buddy.

353
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,757
I'm gonna need to stick my dick
in a socket.

354
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:03,094
- I don't recommend that. But friction-
- Friction?

355
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:06,598
Yeah. Skin-on-skin contact
creates static electricity.

356
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:08,016
You're kidding me, right?

357
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:12,604
Dude, the friction of two like objects
causes a transfer of electrons.

358
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,773
Science 101, Chevy.

359
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:17,859
Probably ditched that class. I did.

360
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:21,905
Find someone to rub against.
It's gonna help.

361
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,740
Well, it's not gonna hurt.

362
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:31,456
Terrific race.

363
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:35,293
That's a great horse, mate.

364
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:38,296
What the fuck, man?

365
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,465
- What the fuck?
- You did it.

366
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:44,010
Mate, that was all you.

367
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,315
Yo, man.

368
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,782
Fucking Doc.

369
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:14,291
Hey there, mister.
Somebody stop him! Stop him.

370
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,500
- Chev.
- No!

371
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,839
The horse! The horse!

372
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,132
Get out of there!

373
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:24,843
Please.

374
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,856
Hey. Wait, wait. Chill out.
He's just had too many drinks.

375
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,983
I got him. Okay?
Go about your business.

376
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,027
- All right.
- Honey, let's go.

377
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:44,029
- My heart.
- Oh, I love you too.

378
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:47,782
Honey, come on. Over here.

379
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:50,952
Are you okay?

380
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,954
Is it the Chinese poison?

381
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:55,373
Friction.

382
00:38:57,293 --> 00:39:00,503
Doc said friction.

383
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:08,887
Chev.

384
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,223
Friction.

385
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,227
Friction?

386
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:21,733
- I'll give you friction.
- Yeah.

387
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,068
Yeah.

388
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:26,696
- Babe, what are you doing?
- I know how this game works.

389
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:29,240
- Oh, yeah. It's working, baby.
- Okay.

390
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:30,700
Yeah. Fuck.

391
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:34,079
Keep going, doll.

392
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,413
Rub it, baby.

393
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:37,582
- Yeah, rub it.
- Fucking good.

394
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,209
Rub it!

395
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:44,381
- Oh, my God. It's gross.
- Hey!

396
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:45,757
No.

397
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,687
Oh, baby.

398
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,237
Fuck, it's working, Eve.

399
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,739
Oh, smash it fucking good, babe.
Come on.

400
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:15,120
Come on, you motherfucker.

401
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:17,038
You fucking nailed it, Doc.

402
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,706
You fucking got it, doctor!

403
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:20,583
- I got it!
- Come on, doctor!

404
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:29,759
Come on, babe, let's switch.

405
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:44,482
Give the kitty some cream, baby.

406
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:47,777
Give the kitty some more cream.
Move your-

407
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,156
Fucking it!

408
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:02,000
I fucking love you. I love you so much.

409
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:51,216
Eve.

410
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:53,301
Stop!

411
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,494
Yo, help us out, man!

412
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:24,082
Door number 6.

413
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,418
Come on, man!

414
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:41,266
Fucking useless.

415
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:42,809
Yeah?

416
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:46,020
Well, you ain't no
Ralph Macchio yourself, Chev!

417
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,128
Go!

418
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,478
Oh, fuck!

419
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:32,400
Did I drop some change,
or did I hear a chink?

420
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,569
Oh, my God!

421
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:36,821
- Fuck you, man!
- Fuck me?

422
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:39,407
Give me the fucking box!

423
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:46,748
Fuck you, Chelios!

424
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:04,349
Get in.

425
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:19,530
- Chev Chelios.
- Don motherfucking Kim.

426
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:23,034
So you pull my lily-white ass
out of the hot grease again.

427
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:28,790
Please, don't thank me.

428
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:33,002
I don't think I shall. I'm not sure
if you're aware of this, Jeeves...

429
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:36,047
...but your slant-eyed associates
have taken something...

430
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:37,674
...of extreme value to me.

431
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,550
And I intend to get it back.

432
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:41,386
You know what you are,
Chev Chelios?

433
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:43,221
Tell me.

434
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:47,558
You are a shit magnet.

435
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:09,747
Your friend has the gay condition.

436
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:13,918
And now, where were we?

437
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:17,714
You were about to tell me
exactly who's got what I need and why.

438
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:21,175
You may have heard
of the name Poon Dong.

439
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:26,931
- Only in dirty limericks.
- The patriarch of our organization.

440
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:29,225
Said to be 100 years old.

441
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:32,895
Considered to be more god than man
by the Triad gangs.

442
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:35,189
But several months ago,
word had spread out...

443
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:37,775
...that Poon Dong
had taken gravely ill.

444
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:41,446
And without a heart transplant,
he only had a few days left to live.

445
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:50,621
- I see.
- Of course, that was unacceptable.

446
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:52,540
Many would have given their hearts...

447
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:55,918
...from their own breasts
to save the life of Poon Dong.

448
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:58,379
But not me. Fuck that.

449
00:45:58,547 --> 00:45:59,589
But many.

450
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,966
Then word spread out
that there was a man...

451
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:04,552
...who had a heart so powerful
that he was capable...

452
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:08,931
...of surviving even our most deadliest
of poisons.

453
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:16,063
- The Chinese shit.
- Yes.

454
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:18,900
It was you, Chev Chelios.

455
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:23,404
It was your heart that Poon Dong
chose to replace his own.

456
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,656
One more question.

457
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:29,118
Who the fuck is El Huron, The Ferret?

458
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:31,454
And how is he involved with all this?

459
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,414
The Ferret?

460
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:47,136
Let's just say our organizations
have a history of conflicting interests.

461
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:49,180
I see.

462
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:52,016
Well, it's mighty white of you
to help me out like this.

463
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:53,601
Now, if you don't mind.

464
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,228
Who said I was helping you out?

465
00:46:55,395 --> 00:47:00,191
My reward for returning you
to Poon Dong will be great.

466
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:06,280
- So this is how it is.
- This is how it is.

467
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:37,645
Chicken and broccoli.

468
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:27,278
- Dude, are you all right?
- Never better.

469
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:37,580
Fish Halman here, bringing you
breaking on-the-scenes coverage...

470
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:40,041
...of an explosion of mayhem,
and lewd behavior...

471
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:42,126
...that has swept the Long Beach area.

472
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:44,962
Our viewers may remember
a similar series of incidents...

473
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:46,964
...which took place
three months back...

474
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:49,717
...involving this unidentified man.

475
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:52,094
Police are now confirming
that today's events...

476
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:55,389
...are the work
of that very same psychotic deviant.

477
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:58,559
Ted Garcia is standing by
in Hollywood Park with a live report.

478
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:00,519
- Take it away, Ted.
- Thanks, Fish.

479
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:02,605
I'm standing here
with a group of people-

480
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:05,441
Families, seniors,
and degenerate gamblers.

481
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:09,028
- that are shocked and traumatized by
what they've witnessed here today...

482
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:12,198
...when what started as a sunny,
Southern California afternoon...

483
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:17,244
...at the races turned, without warning,
into a public, open-air porno.

484
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:18,913
Did you say porno, Ted?

485
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:20,289
Straight up, Fish.

486
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:23,209
I'd like you to meet Glenda Lansing
of Hawaiian Gardens.

487
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:26,796
Glenda says she had an all-too-
up-close-and-personal encounter...

488
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:30,591
...with the suspect just moments
before the shocking incident occurred.

489
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:34,595
That bastard had his filthy hands
all over me.

490
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:36,639
Can you describe exactly
what happened?

491
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:40,101
I never saw a bastard
who wanted it so bad.

492
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:43,854
He put his filthy hands
on every part of me.

493
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:46,899
Okay, that's a little too much
information for this broadcast.

494
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:49,068
Can you describe
the man that assaulted you?

495
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:51,654
He looked like that fella
from the movies.

496
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:53,698
The T-Bag.

497
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:55,157
T- Bag?

498
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:58,369
You know, the Trainspotted fella?

499
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:01,038
- Built like a brick shit house.
- All right, ma'am.

500
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:04,166
You know that kind of language
is not gonna fly on TV.

501
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,544
That son of a bitch.

502
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:10,006
He treated me like his hot little whore.

503
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:13,384
Explain to me...

504
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:18,639
...how you let this motherfucker
get away.

505
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:22,560
He just went buck wild
and killed everybody.

506
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:23,978
But not you.

507
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:26,564
I just got lucky, eh?

508
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:31,402
You know the drill, bitch.

509
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:41,370
Do it.

510
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:51,589
Do it!

511
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:10,524
Now the other one.

512
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:41,472
You got yourself another chance.

513
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:44,475
I don't think you'll fuck it up next time.

514
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:47,686
Now go get yourself a Band-Aid.

515
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:50,106
And go get me
fucking Chelios, cabron!

516
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:11,627
That's the last time.
The last time that son of a bitch...

517
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:14,755
...leaves me with my ass in the wind
in front of 8,000 people!

518
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:20,136
- Lemon. Hey, hey, hey!
- Randy?

519
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:21,637
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

520
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:23,180
It's about the dude.

521
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:24,348
What dude?

522
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:26,016
- The asshole.
- What about him?

523
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:29,436
He's on every channel. The guy's
a fucking psycho killer, baby.

524
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:33,190
Every cop in this city's looking for him,
not to mention the fucking beaners.

525
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:35,025
- The fucking Orientals.
- So?

526
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:37,486
So? So?
So the heat's on the street...

527
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:39,613
...and that dude's
playing for keeps, baby.

528
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:42,032
I have no idea
what the hell you just said.

529
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,201
- Look. Lemon. Lemon, look.
- What?

530
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:47,913
I know we've all been down our
dark roads in the past, okay, babe?

531
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:52,501
I need my hair did, my nails did.
You ain't gave me no money.

532
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:54,336
Where you been at, Randy?

533
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,463
If I ever catch you with another bitch...

534
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:58,883
Well, you do got a big-ass dick
for a white boy.

535
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:05,514
Anyway, look, the point is,
you're my lady now, all right?

536
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:08,392
I don't think it's safe
for you to be out there with that-

537
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:11,562
That sick fucko running wild right now.

538
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,397
- You can say that again.
- Look, look.

539
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:15,858
Listen to me.
Here's what I think we should do.

540
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:18,819
- What, Randy?
- All right, I say we go to the fuzz.

541
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:20,738
We tell them everything.
We come clean.

542
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:22,781
- What?
- The fuzz, all right?

543
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:26,243
I mean, I'd kill this guy myself,
but I got two strikes against me.

544
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:28,370
- Let go of me.
- Look, baby.

545
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:31,916
All right? I'm trying to be cool to you,
but I will drop the hammer.

546
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:34,084
You want me to drop the hammer,
baby?

547
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:44,678
I'm in no mood today, Randy!

548
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:49,850
Lemon!

549
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:04,448
Freeze!

550
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:05,658
Hey!

551
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:07,451
Now, spread it.

552
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:10,788
All right, let's go.

553
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:14,959
Against the car.

554
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:42,319
Don't leave no skid marks, nigga.

555
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:46,740
- Work that ass, baby.
- Ride that shit, big sexy!

556
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:47,992
Put your arm up, son.

557
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:49,952
Eight seconds, nigga! Yeah.

558
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,996
Oh, my God.

559
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:53,664
- Hello.
- Orlando?

560
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:56,583
Venus! What is up, my man?

561
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:59,003
Where you been, man?
I ain't seen your ass since-

562
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:02,756
We was all of us broken up about what
happened to your brother. You okay?

563
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:04,925
- Orlando, I need your help.
- Venus, come on.

564
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:06,677
You my nigga. Can't get no bigger.

565
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:09,221
L.A. Underground,
we're like a family, man.

566
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:11,640
We a freak-ass family,
but we family, all right?

567
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:15,602
- We look out for our own. What?
- I'm looking for a man called The Ferret.

568
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:17,813
El Huron.

569
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:19,898
Shit.

570
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:21,567
Ferret?

571
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,200
Oh, great.

572
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:35,831
Hydrated, man! Keep him hydrated!

573
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:38,709
- Step on it!
- Hold it in. Hold it in. Hold it in.

574
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:42,004
Fuck.

575
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,881
This is an ambulance, you fuckhead!

576
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:48,052
Keep hydrating those organs!

577
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:49,720
- Hold it in!
- Jesus.

578
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:51,722
What are you doing?
This is an ambulance!

579
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:55,559
Right, motherfucker. I'm aware of that.
I'm in need of emergency services.

580
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:58,145
Yeah, we have got a guy
in the back of the ambulance!

581
00:55:58,313 --> 00:55:59,688
Get him out of here, man.

582
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:02,983
- That's one of Don Kim's blokes.
- This man is in critical condition.

583
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:04,860
- Get out of here.
- I'm aware of that.

584
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:06,612
I'm the fucker that put him there.

585
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,864
- Now...
- Okay, he's got a gun!

586
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:10,908
- You're my physician.
- Okay.

587
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:14,078
I'm in need of an external lithium
battery belt...

588
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:17,414
...for an Avicor Total Artificial Heart.

589
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:20,250
- Might you have such a thing?
- We're gonna lose it, Bronc.

590
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:23,921
- Please, look, this guy is fucking dying.
- Don't worry about him.

591
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,923
He's not gonna make it.

592
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:30,803
- Now, about my battery.
- Yeah, you said the Avicor TAH.

593
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:32,679
Yeah, we got it. But why?

594
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:38,602
- Holy shit.
- Chop, chop.

595
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,771
Okay.

596
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:47,069
- He's fucking dead, man.
- Do you mind?

597
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:55,661
- You ready for this shit?
- Do it then.

598
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:57,037
Turn the fucking thing on.

599
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:07,047
Feels like crack.

600
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:08,257
Yeah, but better.

601
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:11,301
You know, those things
aren't designed for strenuous activity.

602
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:13,429
Tell me about it.

603
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:22,271
- Stop the fucking ambulance!
- Dude, we got to go to the hospital.

604
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:23,772
Fuck!

605
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:35,909
Bing fucking Crosby.

606
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:42,875
Breathe out. Raise your buttocks
upward by first walking-

607
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:44,793
Come on, down with that doggie.

608
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,837
Down dog-

609
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:48,755
- Hello.
- Doc, I'm close.

610
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:50,757
So am I.
Chev, can this wait a second?

611
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:53,760
I think I've found that motherfucker
that's got my organ.

612
00:57:53,928 --> 00:57:57,431
I think I got the skinny on that Triad
geezer from my girls on the street.

613
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:00,017
Old news. I'll get back to you
when I have the tart.

614
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:02,019
Chevy, wait!

615
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:11,528
Chev Chelios!

616
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:25,542
Fucking clowns.

617
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:55,239
Cunt!

618
00:58:57,867 --> 00:59:00,285
It's completely normal
to be freaked out...

619
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:02,246
...when someone has a gun
at your head.

620
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:05,165
- I would have shit myself.
- I still have nightmares.

621
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:07,167
Everybody has nightmares.

622
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:10,379
The point is, by coming here
and talking with me...

623
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:15,092
...you made a choice
to confront your issues and lick them.

624
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,261
I can't even leave
my fucking apartment. I-

625
00:59:17,428 --> 00:59:21,598
Every time I go up to leave the door,
I see the guy with the gun.

626
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:23,850
- I'm having a really bad day.
- Oh, shit.

627
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:26,812
Tell me you got epinephrine
in this fucking cart.

628
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,981
Think about it like this, Engleson.

629
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:32,693
Today is the first day
of the rest of your life.

630
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:35,112
You gotta go out and enjoy it.

631
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,782
Knock back a couple of beers,
hit a titty bar.

632
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:42,452
- Excuse me?
- Have some smelly snatch rubbed...

633
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:44,871
...in your face.
You gotta get out there, man.

634
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:46,999
Yeah. I've gotta do it.

635
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:49,293
I'm gonna go and tackle the world.

636
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,295
No, don't tackle the world.

637
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:53,880
Tackle a fucking whore.
Get your dick wet.

638
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:57,259
- Yeah.
- Dip your wick into life a little bit.

639
00:59:57,427 --> 01:00:00,095
- Have some fun.
- Yeah.

640
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:03,473
I'm gonna go out there and I'm gonna
floss my teeth with some pubes.

641
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:05,767
- Oh, now you're on it.
- Thanks, doctor.

642
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:08,270
- Oh, my pleasure.
- No, no, no.

643
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,647
The pleasure's all mine.

644
01:00:10,815 --> 01:00:12,357
I'm done with fear.

645
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:14,735
My life begins today.

646
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:27,748
Fuck!

647
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:56,563
Hey, maybe we better call 911.

648
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:07,324
Where's my box?

649
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:29,179
Five more like that, and your brains
will be strawberry jelly.

650
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:32,265
You can't look in that box!

651
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:34,851
The key and the fucking combo.

652
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:36,353
No!

653
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:37,938
Do it.

654
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:48,698
That's better.

655
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:59,501
This isn't my fucking pumper!

656
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:04,130
What is that?

657
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:08,385
What kind of sick freak carries
something like this around in a box?

658
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:13,348
I am shocked to my fucking core.

659
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:16,226
You've got some deep problems,
motherfucker.

660
01:04:19,897 --> 01:04:21,147
What the fuck is that?

661
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:36,079
Fucking gotta come back
and fucking gotta find out...

662
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:37,581
...what the fuck is this?

663
01:04:37,748 --> 01:04:39,583
What the fuck is-?

664
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,335
- Hello.
- Doc.

665
01:04:42,503 --> 01:04:45,922
When you hung up on me, I was trying
to fucking tell you something.

666
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:48,091
Your heart was transplanted
three weeks ago...

667
01:04:48,259 --> 01:04:49,759
...into that Shaolin motherfucker.

668
01:04:49,927 --> 01:04:52,929
- Fucking great. Now what?
- I'm on it.

669
01:04:53,097 --> 01:04:55,348
Poon Dong is still in L.A.
And if I'm right...

670
01:04:55,516 --> 01:04:58,268
...he's got what you need in pristine,
working condition...

671
01:04:58,436 --> 01:04:59,728
...beating inside his chest.

672
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:02,439
- Good. Where do I find him?
- Don't worry about it.

673
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:03,940
I got people on the street.

674
01:05:19,832 --> 01:05:22,918
Good luck with that, Doc.
I'll try it my way.

675
01:05:23,961 --> 01:05:25,420
Come here, you.

676
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:26,963
Up you get.

677
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:31,760
Okay, darling, one last dance.

678
01:05:32,219 --> 01:05:33,553
Where's the fucking old man?

679
01:05:48,152 --> 01:05:49,319
What old man?

680
01:05:56,786 --> 01:06:00,664
Hey. Hey. I got 5 dollars
that says you blow me for 20 bucks.

681
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:11,675
Oh, stop. Stop right here.
Stop right here.

682
01:06:11,842 --> 01:06:13,259
Hey, baby.

683
01:06:13,427 --> 01:06:14,844
Hey.

684
01:06:15,012 --> 01:06:18,556
- Hey, baby. How you doing?
- I'm doing okay, baby.

685
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:19,933
- Yeah?
- How you doing?

686
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:21,351
What you need?

687
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:24,688
You know what I need.

688
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:28,692
Come on. Come on, Daddy.

689
01:06:34,907 --> 01:06:36,199
Fuck you, Chelios.

690
01:06:56,554 --> 01:06:59,014
Tell me what he's like
when he's at home.

691
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:01,516
When he's home, he's like a ghost.

692
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:04,561
He just plays those video games
all day, all night.

693
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:06,896
- Video games?
- All day.

694
01:07:07,064 --> 01:07:08,231
And you let him do that?

695
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:13,319
I mean, you did buy the games
for him, yeah?

696
01:07:13,487 --> 01:07:14,779
Of course.

697
01:07:14,947 --> 01:07:16,865
Why should I deny my son?

698
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:19,951
- How are you today, Chev?
- I'm golden, sir.

699
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:23,913
Your mom tells me that you've
been getting into quite a bit of trouble.

700
01:07:24,081 --> 01:07:26,166
- Is that true?
- Yes, sir.

701
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:29,502
- Regretfully, that's true.
- What kind of trouble?

702
01:07:30,087 --> 01:07:34,049
Fighting, talking back, pinching.

703
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:35,425
Pinching what?

704
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:39,429
Televisions, stereo components,
books from the library.

705
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:41,931
- That's not all.
- No, sir.

706
01:07:42,099 --> 01:07:45,060
Also a till from a restaurant
and one car.

707
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:47,562
- A toy car?
- No, sir.

708
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:49,230
A BMW Z1.

709
01:07:51,817 --> 01:07:52,859
Hey, sit.

710
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:55,028
People, people, all right.

711
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:58,573
I hear you've been having
quite a bit of trouble at school too.

712
01:08:03,704 --> 01:08:05,413
Chelios.

713
01:08:11,003 --> 01:08:13,088
Nothing I can't handle, sir.

714
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:16,049
- I have a lot of piss and vinegar.
- He's hyperactive.

715
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:17,258
Oh, shit, Mom.

716
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:19,552
You want to watch your
dirty little mouth, son.

717
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:21,888
- We tried giving him Ritalin, but-
- Chev?

718
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:23,807
I sold it.

719
01:08:23,974 --> 01:08:26,434
With all this energy,
you've never thought about...

720
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:28,603
...I don't know, trying out for sports?

721
01:08:41,742 --> 01:08:44,828
- I like to run.
- Chev, where's Dad?

722
01:08:45,412 --> 01:08:48,540
I never met the wanker.
He died before I was born.

723
01:08:48,707 --> 01:08:53,169
What do you think he'd say
if he saw you acting out like this?

724
01:08:53,337 --> 01:08:54,420
Don't know, sir.

725
01:08:54,588 --> 01:08:58,007
If he were here now,
and he asked you:

726
01:08:58,175 --> 01:09:01,177
"Why the bloody hell
do you do the things you do, son?"

727
01:09:01,345 --> 01:09:04,180
- What would you tell him?
- Don't know, sir.

728
01:09:04,348 --> 01:09:06,683
- Bored, I guess.
- Bored, he guesses.

729
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:08,852
- Bored? Bored?
- Shut up.

730
01:09:09,019 --> 01:09:10,812
We're gonna take a short break now.

731
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:13,606
And when we return,
we are gonna find out...

732
01:09:15,025 --> 01:09:19,362
...what makes you tick, little man.

733
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:53,730
Hey.

734
01:09:53,898 --> 01:09:56,232
You okay? Wake up.

735
01:09:56,942 --> 01:09:58,067
Wake up.

736
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:18,087
Ria, baby.

737
01:10:19,173 --> 01:10:20,215
What happened to you?

738
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:26,888
What are you doing out here?

739
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:35,021
What you out here for?

740
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:38,358
I'm looking for the man
that killed my brother.

741
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:44,197
Yeah.

742
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:56,709
I have to go.

743
01:10:57,378 --> 01:10:59,587
I might not come back.

744
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:01,631
Give the girls kisses
and hugs from me.

745
01:11:01,799 --> 01:11:05,260
I kiss and hug all the pussy.
You go kill cocksucker.

746
01:11:20,025 --> 01:11:21,859
Some boyfriend you got there,
Ms. Lydon.

747
01:11:22,027 --> 01:11:24,320
He lied to you
for six months regarding his work?

748
01:11:24,488 --> 01:11:28,825
Which I guess wouldn't be such
a big deal if he wasn't a hired killer.

749
01:11:28,993 --> 01:11:31,703
He made you a target
for the South American mob...

750
01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:34,330
...for kidnapping, torture, or worse.

751
01:11:34,498 --> 01:11:37,125
He sexually humiliated you
in front of what...

752
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:39,085
...I don't know, half of Los Angeles?

753
01:11:39,253 --> 01:11:40,837
Twice.

754
01:11:41,005 --> 01:11:44,173
Twice. And then left you there
to take the rap?

755
01:11:44,341 --> 01:11:46,801
And now you can add an arrest
and a police record...

756
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:50,430
...to a list of wonderful things
Mr. Chelios has brought to your life.

757
01:11:51,056 --> 01:11:53,808
Help me out here, sweetheart, okay?

758
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:58,062
Because-
Because I'm a little bit confused.

759
01:11:59,189 --> 01:12:04,777
Why the fuck do you continue
to protect this asshole?

760
01:12:07,197 --> 01:12:09,949
That's a dicky question.

761
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:13,202
Besides, I don't know
who you're talking about.

762
01:12:14,872 --> 01:12:18,541
I mean, I'd like to see you fall
out of a helicopter and live.

763
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:20,209
What?

764
01:12:36,226 --> 01:12:38,061
It looks like you made bail.

765
01:12:38,228 --> 01:12:40,730
- Great. Can I have my stuff back?
- Yeah.

766
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:43,358
Yeah. Just a-
Just one little piece of advice.

767
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:48,029
Wake the fuck up
and smell what's burning.

768
01:13:29,571 --> 01:13:30,780
Fuck.

769
01:13:38,956 --> 01:13:40,873
Hola, Chev.

770
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:45,586
I take it you're the greasy fucker
that's been hunting me all day.

771
01:13:45,754 --> 01:13:46,796
The Ferret.

772
01:13:46,964 --> 01:13:49,173
Some people know me
by this fucking name.

773
01:13:49,341 --> 01:13:53,386
And many men have died
cursing the name of El Huron...

774
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:57,098
...as they choked on their own blood,
and the blood of their families.

775
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:58,933
Colorful geezer.

776
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:03,187
I was born with another name.

777
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:05,648
The name of my father.

778
01:14:08,068 --> 01:14:10,236
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fucking hell.

779
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:14,490
And my father's father's.

780
01:14:14,658 --> 01:14:16,117
We're all very sad.

781
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:18,453
And the name...

782
01:14:19,496 --> 01:14:21,247
...that I share...

783
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:23,749
...with my two brothers...

784
01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:26,043
...Alejandro...

785
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:31,924
...Ricardo...

786
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:39,599
Verona.

787
01:14:42,686 --> 01:14:45,980
Oh, I can tell, while I dig, dig, dig...

788
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:50,860
...that you had no idea
that there was a third brother.

789
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:54,572
Nope. That fact escaped me.

790
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:57,867
What I assure you of, is I would have
made it a fucking hat trick.

791
01:14:58,035 --> 01:15:00,495
I got a trick or three for you, cabron.

792
01:15:00,662 --> 01:15:04,540
I'm gonna make you wish
that you was never a man.

793
01:15:04,708 --> 01:15:06,792
If you want to kill me,
you get on with it.

794
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,794
What's the rush, Chelios?

795
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:13,925
I know someone
who's going to love to watch this.

796
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:45,748
You.

797
01:16:03,934 --> 01:16:07,853
- You got the donor?
- Like you got a boner.

798
01:16:08,605 --> 01:16:09,855
Hey, baby.

799
01:16:10,023 --> 01:16:13,109
You always say you want
to be more spontaneous.

800
01:16:13,277 --> 01:16:14,777
Cowboy.

801
01:16:14,945 --> 01:16:16,988
We gonna go back to my place.

802
01:16:17,155 --> 01:16:18,948
- Yeah.
- That sounds good.

803
01:16:20,617 --> 01:16:23,411
Ricardo never wanted
my money, Chelios.

804
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:25,580
He was too stubborn.

805
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:28,040
Wanted to make his own way.

806
01:16:28,208 --> 01:16:32,712
Now I think he likes
what my money can buy.

807
01:16:33,338 --> 01:16:36,299
The technology to keep his brain alive.

808
01:16:36,466 --> 01:16:38,301
Not forever.

809
01:16:38,468 --> 01:16:41,721
But long enough to watch you die.

810
01:17:05,329 --> 01:17:07,288
Yo, Ferret. This ain't Roots, man.

811
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:09,165
Yeah?

812
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:11,167
Hey, cabron.

813
01:17:13,754 --> 01:17:16,172
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

814
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:19,008
You killed my brother, motherfucker.
Prepare to die.

815
01:17:51,541 --> 01:17:53,209
Fuck you, Chelios.

816
01:18:50,851 --> 01:18:52,768
This way, sugar.

817
01:18:58,024 --> 01:19:01,861
Confucius say, "Karma's a bitch. "

818
01:19:18,795 --> 01:19:20,963
Hello, Ricky.

819
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:25,509
Why do we go on like this, Ricky?

820
01:19:25,677 --> 01:19:27,344
Hurting each other.

821
01:19:29,473 --> 01:19:30,973
Water?

822
01:19:31,391 --> 01:19:33,434
Did you say water?

823
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:40,608
H20?

824
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:42,318
Coming right up.

825
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:08,641
Chev Chelios. Chev.

826
01:22:18,808 --> 01:22:20,142
Chev.

827
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:22,478
Chev. Chev!

828
01:24:17,177 --> 01:24:18,969
Cut the battery.

829
01:24:19,137 --> 01:24:20,888
Battery's out.

830
01:25:01,221 --> 01:25:02,554
Paddles. Give me the paddles.

831
01:25:02,722 --> 01:25:03,806
What's going on?

832
01:25:08,103 --> 01:25:09,812
Chevy? Clear!

833
01:25:12,899 --> 01:25:14,733
Fuck!

834
01:25:16,903 --> 01:25:21,073
- Shit!
- No! God! No.

835
01:26:17,046 --> 01:26:18,881
What the fuck is wrong with you, man?

836
01:26:19,048 --> 01:26:20,924
What the fuck?

837
01:26:22,468 --> 01:26:24,052
Jesus.

838
01:26:26,389 --> 01:26:28,807
It's so hard to keep a straight face.

839
01:26:28,975 --> 01:26:30,225
Sorry, Ches.

840
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:19,107
Stay on the marker!

841
01:27:19,275 --> 01:27:21,109
- Let's go.
- Body parts ready?

842
01:27:21,277 --> 01:27:24,071
- Yes.
- All right.

843
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:25,280
Here we go!

844
01:27:25,448 --> 01:27:27,199
- And- You set there?
- Ready?

845
01:27:27,367 --> 01:27:29,910
And action, Mike!

846
01:27:33,289 --> 01:27:34,998
Andrew!

847
01:27:45,468 --> 01:27:48,303
Go! Go, Lance! Run, Lance!

848
01:28:15,456 --> 01:28:16,540
Action, Manny!

849
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:19,251
Dropping loads
all over your silly wages!

850
01:28:19,419 --> 01:28:21,044
You think these muscles are free?

851
01:28:21,212 --> 01:28:23,213
You think this cock's for free?

852
01:28:23,381 --> 01:28:26,508
No way! No scabs, no crabs!

853
01:28:26,676 --> 01:28:28,844
No scabs, no crabs!

854
01:28:29,012 --> 01:28:31,346
I'm gonna bang that bitch
in the back!

855
01:28:31,514 --> 01:28:33,932
I'm gonna bang your prisoner!

856
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:37,269
Dropping loads
all over your prisoner!

857
01:28:37,854 --> 01:28:39,980
Look at Jason and say it.

858
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:42,357
Dropping loads
all over your prisoner!

859
01:28:42,525 --> 01:28:45,360
Dropping loads
all over your silly wages!

860
01:28:45,528 --> 01:28:47,654
Yeah! Yeah!

861
01:28:47,822 --> 01:28:49,489
Fuck you!

862
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:54,930
I take it you're the faggot
that's been hunting me all day?

863
01:29:55,098 --> 01:29:56,098
No.

864
01:29:56,265 --> 01:29:57,808
The faggot.

865
01:29:57,975 --> 01:29:59,601
The faggot. Oh, sorry. The Ferret.

866
01:30:57,660 --> 01:31:00,579
No dough, no blow!
No dough, no blow!

867
01:31:00,746 --> 01:31:03,331
Dicks like this don't come for free!

868
01:31:03,791 --> 01:31:05,500
Lips like this don't come for free.

869
01:31:05,668 --> 01:31:07,836
That's what I meant to say.

870
01:31:08,421 --> 01:31:11,173
I meant lips like this
don't come for free.

871
01:31:11,340 --> 01:31:12,716
All right, keep going.

872
01:32:14,237 --> 01:32:16,279
Oh, a horse.

873
01:32:16,781 --> 01:32:18,281
What?

874
01:32:20,493 --> 01:32:23,411
I never had it that way before.

875
01:33:14,839 --> 01:33:16,840
- Let us kiss for a second.
- Okay.

876
01:33:17,008 --> 01:33:18,883
Yeah.

877
01:33:19,051 --> 01:33:22,304
And here we go. And action!

878
01:34:02,595 --> 01:34:05,764
Water.

879
01:34:05,931 --> 01:34:08,475
Fuck, you need a few mints.

880
01:35:04,865 --> 01:35:07,158
- Holy shit.
- Unbelievable.

881
01:35:07,326 --> 01:35:10,537
- Yeah.
- Holy shit. Fuck.

882
01:35:10,705 --> 01:35:12,539
That was fucking awesome.

883
01:35:12,707 --> 01:35:14,958
- Let's cradle the balls on that.
- Good job, buddy.

884
01:35:15,126 --> 01:35:17,043
- I'm sure we got it.
- You good?

885
01:35:17,211 --> 01:35:18,378
- Yeah.
- Good job, brother.

886
01:35:18,546 --> 01:35:20,422
- You okay?
- Yeah.

887
01:35:20,589 --> 01:35:22,716
Fuck, that was hot.
