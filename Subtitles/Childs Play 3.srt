1
00:04:10,505 --> 00:04:11,588
This is Andy barclay.

2
00:04:11,922 --> 00:04:13,797
Eight years ago,
he touched off the scandal

3
00:04:13,963 --> 00:04:15,505
that nearly crippled this company,

4
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,880
claiming that his good guy doll, Chucky,

5
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:22,047
was possessed by Charles Lee ray,

6
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,380
the notorious lakeshore strangler.

7
00:04:29,588 --> 00:04:31,268
Now I ask you, ladies and gentlemen,

8
00:04:31,588 --> 00:04:34,630
after all the lawsuits
and negative publicity,

9
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,838
when the company is finally
getting back on its feet again,

10
00:04:38,547 --> 00:04:41,963
where is the wisdom in putting
the good guy back on the market?

11
00:04:42,922 --> 00:04:46,088
Mr. Sullivan, before any of this happened,

12
00:04:46,255 --> 00:04:49,755
the good guy outsold
all our other toys two-to-one.

13
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:53,005
Even now, interest in
the marketplace is at its peak.

14
00:04:53,172 --> 00:04:54,880
The factory is up and running again.

15
00:04:55,047 --> 00:04:57,713
We should be in stores by next week.

16
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,547
We cannot let the fantasies
of one disturbed boy

17
00:05:02,797 --> 00:05:04,797
influence company policy.

18
00:05:05,047 --> 00:05:07,838
Well, what if the doll somehow affects

19
00:05:08,005 --> 00:05:09,922
another child in a negative way?

20
00:05:10,088 --> 00:05:12,547
You could have a public relations
nightmare on your hands.

21
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:17,672
You know, one of the hardest
things about this business

22
00:05:17,838 --> 00:05:19,838
is that it is a business.

23
00:05:20,755 --> 00:05:23,255
It doesn't matter what we're selling.

24
00:05:23,422 --> 00:05:28,838
Whether it's cars, nuclear weapons,
or, yes, even toys.

25
00:05:29,297 --> 00:05:32,547
The bottom line is the bottom line.

26
00:05:33,047 --> 00:05:36,963
And what are children, after all,
but consumer trainees?

27
00:05:40,505 --> 00:05:42,422
Andy barclay is ancient history.

28
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:48,047
No one remembers him. Nobody cares.

29
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,380
I have made up my mind.

30
00:05:55,047 --> 00:05:56,422
We're moving ahead.

31
00:05:56,922 --> 00:05:58,213
Thank you.

32
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,005
- Okay.
- All right.

33
00:06:01,547 --> 00:06:02,713
Mr. Sullivan.

34
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,338
If there's nothing I can say
to convince you,

35
00:06:06,088 --> 00:06:07,731
then I must go on record with my position.

36
00:06:07,755 --> 00:06:09,380
I'm completely against this.

37
00:06:09,672 --> 00:06:12,672
Your position is crystal clear, miles,

38
00:06:12,838 --> 00:06:15,088
and you can be sure I won't forget.

39
00:06:15,255 --> 00:06:17,088
Just a minute, folks! Please.

40
00:06:17,297 --> 00:06:19,338
Mr. Sullivan, we have
a little surprise for you.

41
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:21,130
The guys at the factory sent this over.

42
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:22,481
And we all wanted you to have it.

43
00:06:22,505 --> 00:06:24,023
It's the first one off the assembly line.

44
00:06:24,047 --> 00:06:25,713
The good guy of the '903!

45
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,172
Well, if there's nothing else,
I'm gonna get going.

46
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,963
Fine.

47
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,755
It's just,
my wife's expecting me.

48
00:06:52,922 --> 00:06:54,047
It's our anniversary.

49
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:55,422
Fine, petzold.

50
00:06:56,672 --> 00:06:59,630
Well, I guess I could review
the larrabee report after dinner.

51
00:07:00,505 --> 00:07:01,880
Good night, Mr. Sullivan.

52
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:03,880
Good night.

53
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,390
Well, despite a downdraft
in the bond market,

54
00:09:02,547 --> 00:09:04,227
stocks were able to
post a rally on Friday,

55
00:09:04,338 --> 00:09:05,898
thanks to a couple of different factors.

56
00:09:05,922 --> 00:09:08,213
Not only did the stronger-than-expected
employment report

57
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,672
allay some recession fears,

58
00:09:09,838 --> 00:09:11,718
but also there was
a technical rebound in stock,

59
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,255
short covering, program buying,

60
00:09:13,422 --> 00:09:15,047
and the resurgence in the deal stocks

61
00:09:15,213 --> 00:09:16,893
help set the tone for rally on the street.

62
00:09:17,047 --> 00:09:18,273
Here's a look at the numbers now.

63
00:09:18,297 --> 00:09:20,523
For Friday, the dow industrial's
up sixteen and two-thirds.

64
00:09:20,547 --> 00:09:21,713
Of the highs of the day,

65
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,731
the transportation average up
a little better than three.

66
00:09:23,755 --> 00:09:27,588
Utilities bouncing up a point to pass
at 12, at 22, 61, 78.

67
00:09:27,755 --> 00:09:29,505
S&p 500 cash are better than two

68
00:09:29,672 --> 00:09:31,552
with the margin peaking up
almost two and a half

69
00:09:31,713 --> 00:09:33,380
with the premier ending at 1.59.

70
00:09:33,547 --> 00:09:35,755
New York stock exchange index up 1.23,

71
00:09:35,922 --> 00:09:38,963
volume backing off a bit
at 164 million shares.

72
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,450
Advances beat declines just about

73
00:09:40,588 --> 00:09:42,189
nine-to-five on the New York
stock exchange.

74
00:09:42,213 --> 00:09:44,922
The up volume 103 million shares,
the down volume 39...

75
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,630
In just a moment's time...

76
00:10:42,547 --> 00:10:43,630
Well, shit.

77
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,189
And bonds headed south

78
00:11:00,213 --> 00:11:01,933
on the stronger-than-expected
economic data,

79
00:11:02,047 --> 00:11:03,567
which served to bolster the us dollar.

80
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,130
The dollar index up a quarter point.

81
00:11:56,005 --> 00:11:57,547
Hi, my name is Larry.

82
00:11:57,713 --> 00:11:59,213
Hi, my name is pauly.

83
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,047
Hey, wanna play?

84
00:12:01,213 --> 00:12:02,755
Hey, wanna play?

85
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,042
I like to be hugged.

86
00:12:04,172 --> 00:12:05,463
I like to be hugged.

87
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,255
Hi, my name is Larry.

88
00:12:07,422 --> 00:12:09,005
Hi, my name is pauly.

89
00:12:09,172 --> 00:12:10,713
Hey, wanna play?

90
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,380
Hey, wanna play?

91
00:12:12,547 --> 00:12:13,713
I like to be hugged.

92
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,047
I like to be hugged.

93
00:12:15,213 --> 00:12:16,880
Hi, my name is Larry.

94
00:12:17,047 --> 00:12:18,630
Hi, my name is pauly.

95
00:12:18,797 --> 00:12:20,338
Hey, wanna play?

96
00:12:20,505 --> 00:12:22,005
Hey, wanna play?

97
00:12:22,172 --> 00:12:23,172
I like to be...

98
00:12:42,047 --> 00:12:44,422
Don't fuck with the Chuck!

99
00:12:46,422 --> 00:12:47,797
Oh, my god.

100
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,380
Bull's-eye!

101
00:13:46,672 --> 00:13:49,713
Just like the good old days.

102
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:54,130
Nothing like a strangulation
to get the circulation going.

103
00:14:05,047 --> 00:14:07,838
You're my only ticket out of here, Andy.

104
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:12,047
I got to get out of this goddamn body.

105
00:14:12,463 --> 00:14:15,297
Where are you, you little shit?

106
00:14:29,797 --> 00:14:31,338
Inward, hut!

107
00:14:45,047 --> 00:14:47,005
Come on.
Come on, yeah! You can do it!

108
00:14:47,172 --> 00:14:49,422
Come on. You can do it, Jackson, hurry up.

109
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:51,297
Yeah! Move. Yes!

110
00:14:51,463 --> 00:14:54,172
Come on. Let's go. Yeah! Come on.

111
00:14:54,338 --> 00:14:56,880
Get moving! Go to the end of the line!

112
00:15:07,797 --> 00:15:09,557
Isee that
for the past eight years

113
00:15:09,713 --> 00:15:11,755
you've been in one
foster home after another.

114
00:15:11,922 --> 00:15:13,213
Mind if I ask why?

115
00:15:15,588 --> 00:15:17,130
They took me away from my mother.

116
00:15:18,463 --> 00:15:21,838
She's, uh... under special care.

117
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,005
I know that.

118
00:15:24,588 --> 00:15:27,047
I meant how come you never
got settled anywhere?

119
00:15:32,088 --> 00:15:33,380
Adjustment problems.

120
00:15:33,713 --> 00:15:35,505
I can read, barclay.

121
00:15:36,422 --> 00:15:37,838
I'm asking you.

122
00:15:41,547 --> 00:15:43,588
I never felt comfortable
with those people.

123
00:15:45,005 --> 00:15:46,755
They weren't family, they were strangers.

124
00:15:49,838 --> 00:15:51,838
All right, listen up, barclay.

125
00:15:53,588 --> 00:15:56,588
I'm willing to cut you some slack
because you've had it so rough,

126
00:15:58,213 --> 00:15:59,630
but you're a troublemaker.

127
00:16:01,213 --> 00:16:03,338
And I got a real problem
with troublemakers.

128
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:05,255
They don't fit into the system.

129
00:16:06,422 --> 00:16:08,005
So here's my advice.

130
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,963
Grow up, you're not a kid anymore.

131
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,463
It's time to forget
these fantasies of killer dolls.

132
00:16:17,672 --> 00:16:18,797
Yes, sir.

133
00:16:20,172 --> 00:16:23,255
"When I was a child, I thought as a child.

134
00:16:23,922 --> 00:16:29,380
But when I became a man,
I put away childish things."

135
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,880
First corinthians.

136
00:16:32,422 --> 00:16:34,005
Look alive, barclay, on your feet!

137
00:16:34,963 --> 00:16:38,547
At Kent, we take bedwetters
and turn them into men.

138
00:16:50,922 --> 00:16:54,505
Oh, yes. Yes.

139
00:16:54,672 --> 00:16:56,588
Oh, yes!

140
00:16:56,755 --> 00:16:59,838
We're seeing some skin now, aren't we?

141
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:05,547
Presto! You're bald.

142
00:17:13,213 --> 00:17:15,422
Always feels a little weird at first.

143
00:17:18,297 --> 00:17:19,380
Next.

144
00:17:29,255 --> 00:17:30,880
Kiss it goodbye.

145
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:39,380
You know, the romans
invented the military cut.

146
00:17:39,713 --> 00:17:40,755
You know why?

147
00:17:40,922 --> 00:17:42,005
Why?

148
00:17:42,172 --> 00:17:43,505
To keep their hair short

149
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,880
so their enemies couldn't
grab a hold of it in battle

150
00:17:48,463 --> 00:17:50,338
and slit their throat.

151
00:17:53,463 --> 00:17:55,047
Now, hold still.

152
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:04,713
Oh, shit.

153
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,588
We 're back,
and we 're better than ever.

154
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,880
No one will play with me.

155
00:18:14,672 --> 00:18:16,755
Uh-oh. There's a friend in need.

156
00:18:20,547 --> 00:18:21,630
Hey, cheer up!

157
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:23,297
Who are you?

158
00:18:23,463 --> 00:18:24,588
I'm a good guy.

159
00:18:24,755 --> 00:18:27,422
Good guy! Good guy!
Good guy! Good guy!

160
00:18:36,963 --> 00:18:39,338
I've just come from
the good guy clubhouse,

161
00:18:39,505 --> 00:18:41,255
and I'll be your friend till the end.

162
00:18:41,505 --> 00:18:42,505
You will?

163
00:18:42,672 --> 00:18:45,255
Wow!

164
00:18:45,422 --> 00:18:46,713
Sure I will.

165
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,047
Hidey-ho!

166
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:52,672
So, all aboard for high-flying fun
with me, your friend till the end,

167
00:18:52,838 --> 00:18:55,922
the good guy doll from play pals.

168
00:18:57,672 --> 00:18:59,130
Come on, man!

169
00:19:43,005 --> 00:19:44,380
Are you okay?

170
00:19:44,547 --> 00:19:46,380
The bastards! Fucking bastards!

171
00:19:46,547 --> 00:19:47,588
What happened?

172
00:19:47,755 --> 00:19:48,898
Shelton, that's what happened.

173
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:51,255
Shelton and his goddamn lackeys.

174
00:19:52,297 --> 00:19:53,630
Thank you. I'm fine.

175
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,380
I'm Andy.

176
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:58,755
You must be new.

177
00:19:58,922 --> 00:20:01,762
Otherwise you'd know they don't
tolerate any form of individuality here.

178
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,760
Certainly nothing so personal
as the first name.

179
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,172
Yeah, right, I forgot. Barclay.

180
00:20:06,547 --> 00:20:10,005
Whitehurst.
Harold Aubrey, for the record.

181
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:15,963
So, who's this Shelton?

182
00:20:16,547 --> 00:20:19,047
Cadet lieutenant colonel Brett c. Shelton.

183
00:20:19,213 --> 00:20:20,588
He's god around here.

184
00:20:21,047 --> 00:20:22,672
Don't expect any mercy from him.

185
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,463
Welcome to hell, barclay.

186
00:20:33,797 --> 00:20:35,297
All present and accounted for, sir.

187
00:20:35,463 --> 00:20:36,630
Thank you, major Ellis.

188
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,005
You're the new boy, huh?

189
00:21:12,672 --> 00:21:13,755
Yeah.

190
00:21:14,797 --> 00:21:15,797
How you doing?

191
00:21:17,297 --> 00:21:18,380
Pretty good.

192
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,838
Who said you could look at me?

193
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,963
Do you know who I am?

194
00:21:26,838 --> 00:21:27,880
Shehon?

195
00:21:28,047 --> 00:21:30,797
That's lieutenant colonel
Shelton to you, asshole!

196
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,422
Lieutenant colonel Shelton.

197
00:21:33,713 --> 00:21:37,880
No. Lieutenant colonel Shelton,

198
00:21:40,172 --> 00:21:41,213
sir.

199
00:21:43,797 --> 00:21:45,838
Lieutenant colonel Shelton, sir.

200
00:21:46,088 --> 00:21:47,547
What's your name, dipweed?

201
00:21:49,047 --> 00:21:50,255
Barclay.

202
00:21:53,047 --> 00:21:54,047
Sir.

203
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:55,213
-Loudel - sir!

204
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,380
-Loudel - sir!

205
00:21:56,547 --> 00:21:57,880
Loudel - Sir!

206
00:22:04,547 --> 00:22:08,338
That's much better, new boy.
That's much better.

207
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:16,130
Shit, whitehurst.

208
00:22:17,963 --> 00:22:20,047
You are without a doubt

209
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:22,880
the most pathetic thing I have ever seen!

210
00:22:24,172 --> 00:22:25,297
Wouldn't you agree?

211
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:29,838
I asked you a question, nimrod!

212
00:22:32,047 --> 00:22:34,005
No, sir! I don't agree, sir!

213
00:22:34,172 --> 00:22:37,380
Are you contradicting me,
you sorry-ass sack of shit?

214
00:22:37,838 --> 00:22:38,922
You asshole.

215
00:22:46,255 --> 00:22:47,338
What did you say?

216
00:22:48,005 --> 00:22:50,380
I

217
00:22:57,713 --> 00:22:59,713
You think you're pretty funny,
don't you, de silva?

218
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:02,005
Yes, I do, sir.

219
00:23:04,338 --> 00:23:07,005
Why don't you drop
and give me 25 right now?

220
00:23:07,172 --> 00:23:08,880
25 what, sir?

221
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,213
25 push-ups, de silva.

222
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,422
One, sir. Two, sir...

223
00:23:19,588 --> 00:23:22,672
Now, you women might think that

224
00:23:22,838 --> 00:23:25,088
because you're so much more delicate,

225
00:23:25,255 --> 00:23:27,588
you deserve some
sort of special treatment...

226
00:23:27,755 --> 00:23:29,088
Nine, sir...

227
00:23:29,297 --> 00:23:31,773
And once a month we're just going to
get on out of your way.

228
00:23:31,797 --> 00:23:33,463
12, sir. 13, sir...

229
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,731
- Well, you can forget it.
- 14, sir...

230
00:23:35,755 --> 00:23:38,338
The same rules apply for everybody.

231
00:23:39,088 --> 00:23:40,880
18, sir. 19, sir...

232
00:23:41,047 --> 00:23:43,088
Only the fittest survive.

233
00:23:43,963 --> 00:23:46,338
21, sir. 22, sir. 23, sir...

234
00:23:46,505 --> 00:23:47,505
One-handed.

235
00:23:50,297 --> 00:23:52,713
24, sir.

236
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,672
25, sir.

237
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,088
Recover.

238
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:18,797
How you doing, Tyler?

239
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:28,380
Sorry. Nothing from your dad today.
Maybe tomorrow.

240
00:24:30,422 --> 00:24:33,755
Listen, he's busy flying jets,
defending the country.

241
00:24:34,088 --> 00:24:35,922
He'll write to you
when he gets the chance.

242
00:24:36,088 --> 00:24:37,130
I know.

243
00:24:40,088 --> 00:24:41,422
I got a job for you.

244
00:24:46,755 --> 00:24:49,922
Would you give this to
the new kid for me? Barclay.

245
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,672
Yes, sir.

246
00:24:52,547 --> 00:24:53,755
Attaboy.

247
00:24:54,588 --> 00:24:55,713
Whoa.

248
00:25:02,797 --> 00:25:07,047
Watch it, kid! Anyway,
how could you be so stupid?

249
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,797
Hey, look out!

250
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,630
A good guy.

251
00:26:15,463 --> 00:26:16,713
Who the fuck are you?

252
00:26:18,338 --> 00:26:21,297
I thought you guys
only said three sentences.

253
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,880
I'm new and improved.

254
00:26:26,172 --> 00:26:28,213
I never saw a doll like you before.

255
00:26:28,713 --> 00:26:31,672
All right, kid, fun's over.

256
00:26:31,922 --> 00:26:34,047
Where the hell's Andy?

257
00:26:35,088 --> 00:26:36,213
Andy?

258
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,130
Can't you read?

259
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:41,130
He was supposed to get this package.

260
00:26:41,297 --> 00:26:44,172
Tampering with the mail
is a federal offense.

261
00:26:45,338 --> 00:26:48,380
Sorry. Is he your best friend?

262
00:26:48,755 --> 00:26:53,255
He's more than that.
He's my new lease on life.

263
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:57,172
Wait a minute.

264
00:26:58,838 --> 00:27:00,463
I got a new body,

265
00:27:01,213 --> 00:27:04,838
and I ain't told anyone
about my little secret yet.

266
00:27:08,047 --> 00:27:11,547
So, uh, what's your name, kid?

267
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,255
Tyler. What's yours?

268
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:17,505
Chucky. But, uh,

269
00:27:18,713 --> 00:27:23,047
my real name is Charles Lee ray.

270
00:27:51,422 --> 00:27:54,380
Whitehurst, what am I doing wrong?

271
00:28:05,213 --> 00:28:06,838
Is there anything you can't do?

272
00:28:07,005 --> 00:28:10,963
Yeah. I can't seem
to get thrown out of this place.

273
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,255
Barclay, meet de silva.

274
00:28:16,713 --> 00:28:18,713
So, want to show me?

275
00:28:19,338 --> 00:28:20,505
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

276
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:36,963
No. Put the elbow... yeah, like that.

277
00:28:43,047 --> 00:28:44,297
And like this.

278
00:28:49,588 --> 00:28:51,547
No. Keep both eyes open.

279
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:55,797
Keep your sights on the target.

280
00:28:58,213 --> 00:28:59,463
Now hold your breath.

281
00:29:00,463 --> 00:29:02,380
Squeeze the trigger, don't pull it.

282
00:29:07,755 --> 00:29:09,297
You're not concentrating.

283
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,800
You know, it was really great what you did
for us back there at formation.

284
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:17,963
Well, Shelton's a major dick.

285
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:20,172
Tell me about it.

286
00:29:27,922 --> 00:29:30,088
Couldn't we just
play hide-and-seek?

287
00:29:30,255 --> 00:29:32,672
Ah! Hold still.

288
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:35,172
What do you call this game anyway?

289
00:29:35,338 --> 00:29:39,880
Hide the soul. Trust me,
you're gonna love it.

290
00:29:40,047 --> 00:29:42,047
Whatever you say, Charles.

291
00:29:47,755 --> 00:29:50,547
Give me the power, I beg of you!

292
00:30:08,505 --> 00:30:09,856
So we divide the troops in half,

293
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,560
- that'll be about 70 on each team.
- Shit!

294
00:30:11,963 --> 00:30:13,880
Charles, stop swearing.

295
00:30:14,797 --> 00:30:16,880
Per soldier, and we're gonna need

296
00:30:17,047 --> 00:30:19,213
- the Springfield 0-3s...
- Yes, sir.

297
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:22,380
Marked for both the red team
and the blue team.

298
00:30:24,047 --> 00:30:25,380
What are you doing, Tyler?

299
00:30:25,838 --> 00:30:27,297
We're playing hide the soul.

300
00:30:29,422 --> 00:30:30,547
I'll catch up with you.

301
00:30:30,713 --> 00:30:32,213
I'll start loading the paint pellets.

302
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,463
We don't play with dolls,
do we now, Tyler?

303
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:37,963
Dolls are for girls.

304
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,713
But Charles is my new best friend.

305
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:44,213
Tyler, you know better than to talk back
to a superior officer.

306
00:30:44,922 --> 00:30:46,005
Yes, sir.

307
00:30:46,172 --> 00:30:47,172
Clean that up.

308
00:30:47,547 --> 00:30:49,005
I'll take care of this.

309
00:30:53,297 --> 00:30:54,422
I'll be back!

310
00:31:04,172 --> 00:31:07,755
Left! Left! Left, right, left!

311
00:31:08,047 --> 00:31:09,547
Left! Left!

312
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,547
Get that weapon up, barclay!

313
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:15,463
Platoon, halt!

314
00:31:16,547 --> 00:31:17,880
Left face!

315
00:31:19,588 --> 00:31:21,380
New boy, fall out!

316
00:31:28,588 --> 00:31:29,672
Fall out!

317
00:31:34,672 --> 00:31:36,630
Order, hut!

318
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,213
Port, arms!

319
00:31:43,505 --> 00:31:45,797
Right shoulder, arms!

320
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:50,547
Left shoulder, arms!

321
00:31:52,588 --> 00:31:54,588
Right shoulder, arms!

322
00:31:56,838 --> 00:31:58,588
Left shoulder, arms!

323
00:32:00,505 --> 00:32:02,047
Port, arms!

324
00:32:07,088 --> 00:32:09,047
Left shoulder, arms!

325
00:32:11,213 --> 00:32:13,088
Port, arms!

326
00:32:14,713 --> 00:32:16,880
Right shoulder, arms!

327
00:32:27,047 --> 00:32:28,255
Barclay!

328
00:32:32,213 --> 00:32:34,297
It's not a Baton, barclay.

329
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:40,338
You look like a goddamn
majorette over here.

330
00:32:44,505 --> 00:32:46,088
I'm not used to guns, sir.

331
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,713
Does this look like a gun to you, barclay?

332
00:32:52,547 --> 00:32:54,047
It's a rifle!

333
00:32:54,713 --> 00:32:55,963
- Major Ellis?
- Sir!

334
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:58,838
Would you please show the new boy
the difference?

335
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,713
This is my rifle, this is my gun.

336
00:33:02,047 --> 00:33:04,880
This is for shooting, and this is for fun.

337
00:33:08,297 --> 00:33:11,630
A soldier's rifle is his best friend.

338
00:33:12,963 --> 00:33:13,963
Remember that.

339
00:33:28,463 --> 00:33:30,963
Stop!

340
00:33:35,172 --> 00:33:36,713
Shit!

341
00:33:41,588 --> 00:33:45,338
Help! Please, mister!

342
00:33:45,547 --> 00:33:47,338
Please, somebody!

343
00:33:47,505 --> 00:33:48,672
Jesus!

344
00:33:48,838 --> 00:33:50,797
I'm stuck! Mister!

345
00:33:52,213 --> 00:33:53,713
I'm in here!

346
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,422
Hold on. I'm coming!

347
00:33:59,922 --> 00:34:01,422
Where are you?

348
00:34:02,588 --> 00:34:04,005
I'm coming.

349
00:34:11,213 --> 00:34:12,922
Yell or something! Make a noise!

350
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,005
Where are you?

351
00:34:27,297 --> 00:34:28,547
What the...

352
00:34:35,963 --> 00:34:37,547
Oh, my god.

353
00:34:37,963 --> 00:34:39,672
No! Stop!

354
00:34:47,505 --> 00:34:48,505
Stop!

355
00:35:04,047 --> 00:35:05,481
Fall out.

356
00:35:14,213 --> 00:35:15,713
You get back there.

357
00:35:30,713 --> 00:35:32,213
Better finish unpacking, barclay.

358
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,630
Shelton's notorious
for surprise inspections.

359
00:35:38,172 --> 00:35:39,380
What are you doing?

360
00:35:39,547 --> 00:35:41,713
What does it look like?
I'm polishing Shelton's shoes.

361
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,547
He makes you Polish his shoes?

362
00:35:46,172 --> 00:35:48,172
No, I offered out of
the kindness of my heart.

363
00:35:54,213 --> 00:35:57,963
Whitehurst, did you see Cochrane
with that doll today?

364
00:35:58,130 --> 00:35:59,255
No. What doll?

365
00:36:00,297 --> 00:36:02,172
He was carrying a good guy doll,

366
00:36:03,713 --> 00:36:05,523
just before the accident
with the garbage truck.

367
00:36:05,547 --> 00:36:07,088
Good guys, I remember those.

368
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,297
Yeah, me, too.

369
00:36:16,088 --> 00:36:18,422
Uh, lights out in a few minutes.

370
00:36:19,463 --> 00:36:20,672
I'm going to go get washed up.

371
00:36:34,922 --> 00:36:36,255
Barclay, I almost forgot.

372
00:36:36,422 --> 00:36:38,523
Sergeant Clark wanted to know
if you got that package.

373
00:36:38,547 --> 00:36:39,547
What package?

374
00:36:39,713 --> 00:36:41,439
He said you got a package in the mail.

375
00:36:41,463 --> 00:36:43,672
That little kid, Tyler,
was supposed to bring it to you.

376
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:45,380
- Didn't you get it?
- No.

377
00:36:48,797 --> 00:36:50,505
Who would've sent me a package?

378
00:38:12,255 --> 00:38:15,588
Hey, long time no see, pal.

379
00:38:15,797 --> 00:38:17,630
No, you're dead. We killed you!

380
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,922
You know what they say,

381
00:38:21,088 --> 00:38:24,172
you just can't keep a good guy down.

382
00:38:30,255 --> 00:38:33,213
Andy, how you've grown.

383
00:38:33,547 --> 00:38:35,172
You're not gonna kill me. You need me.

384
00:38:35,338 --> 00:38:36,939
You need to transfer your soul
into my body.

385
00:38:36,963 --> 00:38:38,547
Wrong again, wimp.

386
00:38:38,713 --> 00:38:40,797
I got some fresh meat lined up

387
00:38:40,963 --> 00:38:43,380
and I'm not gonna let you spoil it,
not this time.

388
00:38:43,755 --> 00:38:45,797
Tyler.

389
00:38:46,047 --> 00:38:50,672
Yeah, just think. Chucky's gonna be a bro.

390
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:54,103
I'm not gonna let you get away with this.

391
00:38:56,422 --> 00:38:57,862
I'm not gonna let you near that kid.

392
00:39:15,505 --> 00:39:18,505
What's the matter, barclay, huh?
You homesick?

393
00:39:19,422 --> 00:39:20,672
You miss your mommy?

394
00:39:24,338 --> 00:39:25,547
What the fuck is this?

395
00:39:25,713 --> 00:39:27,606
I'm sorry about your shoe, all right.
I'll Polish it.

396
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:29,713
Just give me back the doll.

397
00:39:30,297 --> 00:39:32,172
No, no, you listen to me.

398
00:39:33,297 --> 00:39:35,047
You tell whitehurst
he's off the hook, huh?

399
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:37,255
I got myself another slave.

400
00:39:39,213 --> 00:39:42,672
And clean up this mess.
You got five demerits.

401
00:39:43,713 --> 00:39:44,755
What about the doll?

402
00:39:46,922 --> 00:39:49,422
Ah. My kid sister's birthday is coming up.

403
00:39:50,297 --> 00:39:52,172
I think she's gonna love it, don't you?

404
00:41:41,463 --> 00:41:42,713
Oh, shit.

405
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:14,713
Andy.

406
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,380
What the fuck?

407
00:42:22,047 --> 00:42:23,088
No, stop!

408
00:42:23,713 --> 00:42:25,481
What the fuck are you doing
in my room, barclay?

409
00:42:25,505 --> 00:42:26,963
You wouldn't believe me.

410
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,713
Where's the doll, barclay?

411
00:42:32,713 --> 00:42:34,338
Where's the fucking doll?

412
00:42:34,672 --> 00:42:35,963
- You took it, didn't you?
- No!

413
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:37,255
What's going on?

414
00:42:39,088 --> 00:42:40,768
Yeah, well, somebody sure as hell took it.

415
00:42:54,005 --> 00:42:55,213
It's almost midnight, colonel.

416
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,005
Is this really necessary?

417
00:42:57,713 --> 00:42:59,713
I'm trying to weed out a thief, sir.

418
00:43:00,672 --> 00:43:02,064
You've always told me how important it is

419
00:43:02,088 --> 00:43:03,273
to uphold the school's code of honor.

420
00:43:03,297 --> 00:43:05,422
I'm simply trying to impress that
upon the men, sir.

421
00:43:09,463 --> 00:43:11,088
All right, Shelton, make your point.

422
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:14,380
But I want everybody back inside
at 0100 hours.

423
00:43:14,547 --> 00:43:15,797
Yes, sir.

424
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:22,023
By the time we get through with barclay,

425
00:43:22,047 --> 00:43:24,167
he's going to be living
in a whole world full of shit.

426
00:43:25,255 --> 00:43:27,547
All right. We've only got an hour,
so let's make it count.

427
00:43:27,713 --> 00:43:29,005
Yes, sir.

428
00:43:30,838 --> 00:43:33,713
All right, ladies,
get those weapons in the air.

429
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,463
I want to see 'em high!

430
00:43:36,088 --> 00:43:37,338
Higher!

431
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,505
I think I'm gonna throw up.

432
00:43:44,005 --> 00:43:45,380
You're dead, new boy.

433
00:43:45,547 --> 00:43:46,713
Fucking geek.

434
00:44:18,213 --> 00:44:19,672
"Dear Charles, you're it.

435
00:44:19,838 --> 00:44:21,880
Come and find me, your best friend."

436
00:44:22,797 --> 00:44:23,797
Shit.

437
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:34,047
Charles.

438
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:40,422
Come and find me!

439
00:44:41,338 --> 00:44:43,380
God damn it.

440
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:45,505
- Platoon!
- Hut!

441
00:44:45,672 --> 00:44:46,672
Double time!

442
00:44:46,838 --> 00:44:47,880
Hut!

443
00:44:48,713 --> 00:44:50,380
Get those knees up, ladies!

444
00:44:51,213 --> 00:44:52,672
Whitehurst, where do the kids sleep?

445
00:44:52,838 --> 00:44:54,380
Above the portico. Why?

446
00:44:54,547 --> 00:44:56,880
You're wearing combat boots,
not ballet slippers.

447
00:44:57,797 --> 00:44:59,755
- Come on, move!
- Barclay!

448
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:02,213
It's gonna get
a lot worse than this!

449
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:04,755
Get the lead out. Come on, move it!

450
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:07,047
Faster, faster. Let's go, Brock!

451
00:45:07,213 --> 00:45:09,297
Get those knees in the sky! Come on!

452
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,547
You son of a bitch!

453
00:45:21,213 --> 00:45:22,963
You got a hell of a punch there, barclay.

454
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:25,380
Now I'll see what kind of
tough guy you really are.

455
00:45:27,172 --> 00:45:28,505
Get your head around.

456
00:46:08,422 --> 00:46:11,713
Tyler, come out, come out,
wherever you are.

457
00:46:13,838 --> 00:46:17,088
Olly olly oxen free.

458
00:46:17,922 --> 00:46:20,963
Get out here, you little son of a bitch.

459
00:46:32,047 --> 00:46:33,338
- Three!
- Three!

460
00:46:33,505 --> 00:46:34,963
You're not sounding off.

461
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:37,005
- Four!
- You're pissing me off!

462
00:46:37,172 --> 00:46:38,172
Five!

463
00:46:38,338 --> 00:46:40,047
All right, barclay, you got me curious.

464
00:46:40,713 --> 00:46:42,297
What are you trying to prove?

465
00:46:42,463 --> 00:46:43,838
Forget it.

466
00:46:44,213 --> 00:46:45,880
No, really, I want to know.

467
00:46:46,755 --> 00:46:47,922
All right.

468
00:46:48,297 --> 00:46:50,255
The doll's alive. He's after Tyler.

469
00:46:50,588 --> 00:46:51,588
You're right, forget it.

470
00:46:51,755 --> 00:46:53,713
I just hope he can take care of himself.

471
00:46:54,963 --> 00:46:57,172
Come on.

472
00:46:57,338 --> 00:46:59,172
Quiet.

473
00:47:03,172 --> 00:47:04,422
Shut up.

474
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:06,130
Okay, come on.

475
00:47:10,547 --> 00:47:11,797
Come on.

476
00:47:12,172 --> 00:47:14,088
I can't believe
I let you talk me into this.

477
00:47:14,255 --> 00:47:16,297
Okay, just stay here
and keep an eye out, okay?

478
00:47:16,463 --> 00:47:19,005
- Oh, I live for this.
- I know, ivers. Now, go, go!

479
00:47:28,713 --> 00:47:31,672
You know, I don't see
what you see in that guy, anyway.

480
00:47:32,297 --> 00:47:34,689
I don't know, he's... well, he's just
different from everybody else.

481
00:47:34,713 --> 00:47:35,713
Oh, please.

482
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:38,422
- Oh, he's kind of cute, too.
- Mmm.

483
00:47:39,047 --> 00:47:40,213
Okay.

484
00:47:42,505 --> 00:47:45,630
Foster homes. No wonder he's so quiet.

485
00:47:48,922 --> 00:47:50,213
What was that?

486
00:48:12,255 --> 00:48:13,505
So you took the doll?

487
00:48:13,672 --> 00:48:16,047
Shelton will have you court-martialed
if he finds out.

488
00:48:16,213 --> 00:48:18,422
We're playing hide and seek.
What are you guys doing?

489
00:48:18,588 --> 00:48:19,713
We couldn't sleep.

490
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,880
Oh, he is so cute.

491
00:48:23,047 --> 00:48:26,213
Ivers! Give him back!

492
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:29,338
You guys, please be quiet.

493
00:48:29,588 --> 00:48:30,672
Can you go stand guard?

494
00:48:30,838 --> 00:48:32,088
Yes, sir.

495
00:48:34,172 --> 00:48:35,422
So what's his name?

496
00:48:35,588 --> 00:48:37,463
- Ask him yourself.
- All right.

497
00:48:38,505 --> 00:48:40,380
What is your name, little doll?

498
00:48:41,047 --> 00:48:44,380
Hi, I'm Chucky.
And I'm your friend to the end.

499
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:46,463
Hidey-ho!

500
00:48:46,713 --> 00:48:48,463
I love it.

501
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:50,505
His real name is Charles Lee ray.

502
00:48:50,672 --> 00:48:53,047
Oh, is that so? Give me your lipstick.

503
00:48:53,213 --> 00:48:54,588
- What for?
- Just give it to me.

504
00:48:54,755 --> 00:48:56,130
Oh, no.

505
00:48:56,630 --> 00:48:57,880
What are you doing?

506
00:48:58,047 --> 00:48:59,255
You'll see.

507
00:48:59,422 --> 00:49:00,713
Wait. Stop.

508
00:49:00,963 --> 00:49:02,773
- Here you go, little baby!
- Come on!

509
00:49:02,797 --> 00:49:03,838
You're messing him up.

510
00:49:04,005 --> 00:49:05,005
Oh, you're so cute.

511
00:49:05,172 --> 00:49:06,838
- Aw.
- Don't do that!

512
00:49:07,047 --> 00:49:08,672
Don't. He looks stupid.

513
00:49:09,047 --> 00:49:10,713
You're making him look like a wuss.

514
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,560
- No, he looks sweet.
- What are you doing?

515
00:49:12,672 --> 00:49:14,338
Oh.

516
00:49:14,505 --> 00:49:16,047
You guys, someone's coming.

517
00:49:16,963 --> 00:49:17,963
Come on, let's go.

518
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:19,338
Come on. Let's go.

519
00:49:19,505 --> 00:49:21,922
Stop! What about Charles?

520
00:49:29,588 --> 00:49:31,297
This means war.

521
00:50:35,255 --> 00:50:36,755
What the hell?

522
00:50:53,213 --> 00:50:55,380
- I like to be hugged.
- Ah! Jeez.

523
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:35,005
Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me!

524
00:52:07,713 --> 00:52:09,547
A man lives through two tours in 'nam

525
00:52:09,713 --> 00:52:11,838
and then one night he just drops dead.

526
00:52:12,755 --> 00:52:14,255
Doesn't make any sense.

527
00:52:28,172 --> 00:52:29,797
At ease!

528
00:52:30,672 --> 00:52:32,130
We will now take a moment of silence

529
00:52:32,297 --> 00:52:33,588
to honor colonel Cochrane.

530
00:52:34,672 --> 00:52:37,713
He was a fine man
and he will be sorely missed.

531
00:52:38,463 --> 00:52:39,755
Bow your heads for prayer.

532
00:52:45,088 --> 00:52:46,880
Take seats!

533
00:53:03,713 --> 00:53:05,213
It's getting pretty shaggy, Carlson.

534
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:06,713
I want to see you on Friday.

535
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,172
Yes, sergeant.

536
00:53:08,755 --> 00:53:10,172
Monday, fabrizio.

537
00:53:10,338 --> 00:53:11,422
Yes, sir.

538
00:53:13,255 --> 00:53:14,463
My man.

539
00:53:23,088 --> 00:53:24,588
Tuesday.

540
00:53:31,172 --> 00:53:34,172
Look at you, whitehurst.
You're a disgrace.

541
00:53:34,338 --> 00:53:36,005
When's the last time you had a trim?

542
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:38,047
Two weeks ago, sergeant, I think.

543
00:53:38,213 --> 00:53:39,380
You think? You think?

544
00:53:39,547 --> 00:53:41,672
I want to see you right after breakfast.
You got it?

545
00:53:41,838 --> 00:53:43,880
Yes, sir, sergeant botnick, sir.

546
00:53:44,047 --> 00:53:46,172
And what are you looking at, new boy?

547
00:53:47,797 --> 00:53:49,130
Wednesday.

548
00:53:56,963 --> 00:53:58,797
Barclay, what are you doing?

549
00:53:59,255 --> 00:54:01,422
You can't just get up
in the middle of mess.

550
00:54:12,047 --> 00:54:13,255
Major.

551
00:54:14,547 --> 00:54:15,672
At ease!

552
00:54:27,422 --> 00:54:28,463
Tyler.

553
00:54:28,630 --> 00:54:30,088
Hi, barclay. What's up?

554
00:54:30,255 --> 00:54:31,797
I gotta talk to you about Chucky.

555
00:54:31,963 --> 00:54:33,588
You mean Charles.

556
00:54:34,713 --> 00:54:35,755
Have you seen him?

557
00:54:37,338 --> 00:54:38,588
Not since last night.

558
00:54:39,713 --> 00:54:40,713
He's hiding somewhere.

559
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,797
He's gonna lay low
till he knows you're alone,

560
00:54:42,963 --> 00:54:44,148
and then he's gonna come after you.

561
00:54:44,172 --> 00:54:45,172
He just wants to play.

562
00:54:45,338 --> 00:54:46,422
Listen to me, Tyler.

563
00:54:46,588 --> 00:54:49,963
No matter what he says,
no matter what he promises you,

564
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:51,547
you've gotta stay away from him.

565
00:54:52,213 --> 00:54:53,533
Don't let him fool you. He's bad.

566
00:54:53,922 --> 00:54:56,088
Charles isn't bad. He's a good guy.

567
00:54:56,463 --> 00:54:59,088
- It says so on his shirt.
- He lies, Tyler.

568
00:54:59,255 --> 00:55:00,547
Believe me, he's bad news.

569
00:55:00,713 --> 00:55:01,922
He's hurt a lot of people.

570
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:04,770
I think colonel Cochrane was one of them.

571
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:08,755
You're just jealous 'cause he's
my best friend now, instead of yours.

572
00:55:13,672 --> 00:55:16,880
Look, you better keep this.

573
00:55:19,922 --> 00:55:22,630
Whitehurst, you are without a doubt

574
00:55:22,797 --> 00:55:27,547
the sorriest excuse for a soldier
to ever disgrace these walls.

575
00:55:28,005 --> 00:55:31,713
Face it, you're not cut out for this life.

576
00:55:32,213 --> 00:55:33,630
Why don't you do yourself a favor

577
00:55:33,797 --> 00:55:35,338
and get the hell out of Kent?

578
00:55:35,797 --> 00:55:38,547
If I had any choice
in the matter, I would, sir.

579
00:55:39,172 --> 00:55:40,505
Smart-ass.

580
00:55:41,047 --> 00:55:43,672
Presto! You're bald.

581
00:55:57,630 --> 00:55:59,172
Yeah.

582
00:56:20,213 --> 00:56:21,380
What the hell?

583
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:26,880
How'd you get in there?

584
00:56:33,422 --> 00:56:35,630
That haircut ain't regulation, soldier.

585
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:40,588
When's the last time you had a trim, huh?

586
00:56:49,713 --> 00:56:51,047
Kiss it goodbye.

587
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:24,505
Presto! You're dead.

588
00:57:30,422 --> 00:57:32,713
It's definitely you.

589
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:48,172
I just forgot my... my...

590
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:54,213
Boo!

591
00:57:56,713 --> 00:57:58,547
The annual war games

592
00:57:59,088 --> 00:58:02,547
have been an unbroken tradition
here at Kent for over 50 years.

593
00:58:03,672 --> 00:58:06,797
Colonel Cochrane was a man who believed
in the value of tradition.

594
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:09,797
He not only would have wanted us to go on,

595
00:58:09,963 --> 00:58:11,713
he'd have ordered us to go on.

596
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:18,380
Therefore, the war games
will proceed as scheduled.

597
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,380
Hoo-ah!

598
00:58:21,672 --> 00:58:25,130
Lieutenant colonel Shelton
will command the blue team.

599
00:58:26,088 --> 00:58:27,755
Major rawlings will head up the reds.

600
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,713
The objective is simple.

601
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,880
To capture the other team's flag,

602
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:35,838
bring it back here safely to base.

603
00:58:36,297 --> 00:58:37,588
Rawlings.

604
00:58:39,213 --> 00:58:43,047
You will pick up your weapons
in the armory before moving out.

605
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:49,505
You will be using
the standard issue Springfield 0-3.

606
00:58:51,213 --> 00:58:52,547
Your ammo.

607
00:58:56,463 --> 00:58:57,713
Shelton.

608
00:59:06,505 --> 00:59:08,922
If you get hit, you are dead.

609
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:11,130
Hike back to base.

610
00:59:12,213 --> 00:59:15,713
Commanders, take charge of your teams.

611
00:59:19,255 --> 00:59:21,130
May the best team win.

612
00:59:21,672 --> 00:59:24,338
Good luck, men and women.

613
00:59:27,588 --> 00:59:29,213
Nice of you to join us.

614
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,963
Looks like botnick's
in a pretty bad mood today.

615
00:59:34,838 --> 00:59:36,047
What's wrong?

616
00:59:36,547 --> 00:59:39,338
Nothing. Nothing's wrong.

617
00:59:41,963 --> 00:59:43,643
Nothing's wrong. I'm fine.
Nothing's wrong.

618
00:59:58,547 --> 01:00:00,880
This ought to slow the pricks down.

619
01:00:14,547 --> 01:00:17,213
Left! Left! Left!

620
01:00:18,547 --> 01:00:20,380
J“ here we go again j“

621
01:00:20,547 --> 01:00:22,505
J“ here we go again I

622
01:00:22,672 --> 01:00:24,380
I same old stuff again j“

623
01:00:24,547 --> 01:00:26,505
J“ same old stuff again j“

624
01:00:26,672 --> 01:00:28,463
J“ marching down the Avenue j“

625
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:30,672
J“ marching down the Avenue j“

626
01:00:30,838 --> 01:00:32,731
J“ two more miles,
we'll be through j“

627
01:00:32,755 --> 01:00:34,630
J“ two more miles,
we'll be through j“

628
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,797
J“ I'll be getting rid of you j“

629
01:00:36,963 --> 01:00:39,047
J“ I'll be getting rid of you j“

630
01:00:39,213 --> 01:00:41,047
J“ same old ugly stuff j“

631
01:00:41,213 --> 01:00:43,213
J“ same old ugly stuff j“

632
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:45,213
J“ here we go again j“

633
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:47,463
J“ here we go again j“

634
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:49,380
J“ marching down the Avenue j“

635
01:00:49,547 --> 01:00:51,505
J“ marching down the Avenue j“

636
01:00:51,672 --> 01:00:53,632
J“ one more mile,
we'll be through j“

637
01:00:53,672 --> 01:00:55,588
J“ one more mile, we'll be through j“

638
01:00:55,755 --> 01:00:57,713
J“ I'll be getting rid of you j“

639
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:00,213
J“ I'll be getting rid of you j“

640
01:01:01,297 --> 01:01:02,672
what's going on, whitehurst?

641
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:08,047
You saw something, didn't you?
You saw Chucky.

642
01:01:09,713 --> 01:01:11,193
Don't wimp out on me now, whitehurst.

643
01:01:11,255 --> 01:01:13,297
I need your help.
That kid needs your help.

644
01:01:13,463 --> 01:01:15,130
I didn't see anything, okay?

645
01:01:15,297 --> 01:01:16,838
I didn't see anything at all.

646
01:01:18,047 --> 01:01:19,814
J“ your left, right, your left j“

647
01:01:19,838 --> 01:01:21,755
J“ your left, right, your left j“

648
01:01:21,922 --> 01:01:23,588
J“ your military left j“

649
01:01:23,755 --> 01:01:25,672
J“ your military left j“

650
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,564
Ellis, let's make sure
the perimeters are secured.

651
01:01:40,588 --> 01:01:41,630
Yes, sir.

652
01:01:41,797 --> 01:01:43,380
She checks all the windows,

653
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:48,380
and then the babysitter
hears this thump, thump,

654
01:01:49,088 --> 01:01:50,380
thumping.

655
01:01:50,547 --> 01:01:54,130
Like something's being dragged
across the floor upstairs.

656
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:58,005
And suddenly she thinks,
"I haven't checked on the children."

657
01:01:58,755 --> 01:02:01,005
So she hurries to the top of the stairs,

658
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:03,213
and when she gets there,

659
01:02:03,922 --> 01:02:09,213
she sees her boyfriend,
completely dismembered,

660
01:02:10,213 --> 01:02:13,880
dragging himself
across the floor by his chin.

661
01:02:15,547 --> 01:02:17,880
Thump. Slide.

662
01:02:18,797 --> 01:02:20,838
Thump. Slide.

663
01:02:22,213 --> 01:02:23,380
Thump. Slide.

664
01:02:23,547 --> 01:02:24,630
That is gross.

665
01:02:26,088 --> 01:02:30,755
Hey, you guys,
I got a better story and it's true.

666
01:02:31,213 --> 01:02:34,005
It's about this mental institution,

667
01:02:34,172 --> 01:02:36,463
and it's a few miles away from here.

668
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:38,963
Hey!

669
01:02:41,797 --> 01:02:43,297
Hope it wasn't something I said.

670
01:02:43,463 --> 01:02:46,505
No. I'm sorry.

671
01:02:53,630 --> 01:02:55,922
De silva, where do you think
the red team's camped out?

672
01:02:56,088 --> 01:02:57,088
Could be anywhere.

673
01:02:57,255 --> 01:02:58,922
Shelton'll find them. He always does.

674
01:03:02,047 --> 01:03:04,213
By the way, you can call me Kristin.

675
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:06,713
What?

676
01:03:07,130 --> 01:03:08,380
Kristin.

677
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:12,255
It's my first name. Do you have one?

678
01:03:13,588 --> 01:03:15,213
- Andy.
- Huh.

679
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:18,505
Come on, Andy,
I want to show you something.

680
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:30,047
Pretty cool, huh?

681
01:03:30,797 --> 01:03:31,880
Yeah.

682
01:03:33,463 --> 01:03:35,338
I almost forgot there
were places like that.

683
01:03:36,255 --> 01:03:38,088
People just go to have fun.

684
01:03:38,255 --> 01:03:39,880
Listen.

685
01:03:41,088 --> 01:03:42,463
Somebody's out there.

686
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:47,797
It's probably just a chipmunk
or something.

687
01:03:50,213 --> 01:03:52,047
Nothing scares you, does it?

688
01:04:00,213 --> 01:04:03,297
Man, now I really gotta get out
of this body.

689
01:04:13,505 --> 01:04:14,880
I'm going after Tyler.

690
01:04:15,797 --> 01:04:17,463
Are you crazy? You'll never find them.

691
01:04:17,630 --> 01:04:18,797
Wanna bet?

692
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:21,047
I swiped this from Shelton's tent.

693
01:04:21,213 --> 01:04:23,813
He sent out a reconnaissance mission
right before we pitched camp.

694
01:04:25,088 --> 01:04:27,463
The red team is somewhere around here.

695
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:32,172
That kid's a sitting duck, whitehurst.

696
01:04:32,755 --> 01:04:34,630
Now, are you with me or not?

697
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:39,130
I'm sorry, I can't.

698
01:05:03,963 --> 01:05:05,963
Up and at 'em, ladies,
we're moving out!

699
01:05:10,422 --> 01:05:12,755
I want this camp to be a ghost town
in five minutes!

700
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:15,398
I thought we weren't
going until dawn, sir.

701
01:05:15,422 --> 01:05:17,856
Someone stole the reconnaissance map
out of the colonel's tent,

702
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:19,040
so we're making our move now.

703
01:05:19,130 --> 01:05:20,380
Get going, hanley.

704
01:05:23,672 --> 01:05:25,213
Whitehurst.

705
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:27,911
You wouldn't know anything
about a missing map, would you?

706
01:05:33,588 --> 01:05:36,380
Where the hell's barclay? Whitehurst!

707
01:05:39,005 --> 01:05:41,165
Colonel Shelton, you'd better have
a look in here, sir.

708
01:05:46,172 --> 01:05:47,297
What is it, Ellis?

709
01:05:48,213 --> 01:05:49,713
Barclay's gone awol, sir.

710
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:54,213
He stole the map.

711
01:05:55,547 --> 01:05:58,047
That little fucking traitor's
doubling for the reds.

712
01:06:17,005 --> 01:06:18,047
Where's Tyler?

713
01:06:18,213 --> 01:06:20,547
He went awol with some guy named Charles.

714
01:06:29,047 --> 01:06:30,547
Where's Andy?

715
01:06:31,588 --> 01:06:32,880
Whitehurst, where is he?

716
01:06:33,047 --> 01:06:34,380
Platoon, halt!

717
01:06:37,213 --> 01:06:40,297
All right. De silva, you're going
to take the right flank.

718
01:06:40,463 --> 01:06:41,856
Siegel, you take the left.
I want you to check in

719
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:43,422
on the radio every five minutes.

720
01:06:43,588 --> 01:06:44,963
- Yes, sir.
- All right, move it.

721
01:06:46,088 --> 01:06:47,481
The rest of us are gonna spread out

722
01:06:47,505 --> 01:06:49,297
and meet up with Ellis at split rock.

723
01:06:49,755 --> 01:06:51,047
Move out!

724
01:06:53,005 --> 01:06:54,672
Whitehurst, move!

725
01:07:04,422 --> 01:07:05,880
Thanks for coming after me.

726
01:07:06,047 --> 01:07:07,297
What are friends for?

727
01:07:12,088 --> 01:07:13,172
Duck.

728
01:07:17,672 --> 01:07:19,463
That was a close one.

729
01:07:19,630 --> 01:07:23,547
Now, we can play hide the soul.

730
01:07:23,713 --> 01:07:27,213
I'm tired. I don't want to play
that dumb game anymore.

731
01:07:27,672 --> 01:07:29,922
You're a fucking drag, you know that?

732
01:07:30,255 --> 01:07:31,463
Watch your mouth, Charles.

733
01:07:31,672 --> 01:07:33,172
Stop calling me that!

734
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:36,172
What's the knife for?

735
01:07:36,755 --> 01:07:41,088
A good soldier is always prepared, Tyler.

736
01:07:41,255 --> 01:07:44,172
Barclay was right. You're not a good guy.

737
01:07:44,755 --> 01:07:49,255
Sorry, kid, you got me. I'm bad.

738
01:07:50,547 --> 01:07:52,547
Now, assume the position.

739
01:07:56,755 --> 01:07:57,922
No!

740
01:08:02,297 --> 01:08:03,880
Get back here!

741
01:08:04,047 --> 01:08:06,630
Barclay! Barclay!

742
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:14,380
Tyler!

743
01:08:18,338 --> 01:08:20,098
Barclay, you fucking traitor,
give me my map!

744
01:08:20,255 --> 01:08:21,297
Listen to me, Shelton!

745
01:08:21,463 --> 01:08:23,797
You got any idea what we do
to traitors, barclay?

746
01:08:23,963 --> 01:08:25,338
Tyler's in trouble.

747
01:08:26,255 --> 01:08:27,838
Come on, whitehurst, back me up.

748
01:08:30,588 --> 01:08:31,856
Major Ellis, call in the flanks.

749
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:33,213
Yes, sir.

750
01:08:34,088 --> 01:08:35,547
De silva, Siegel, do you copy?

751
01:08:38,005 --> 01:08:39,297
De silva, do you copy?

752
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,547
De silva, come in.

753
01:08:52,088 --> 01:08:53,288
Siegel's on his way back, sir.

754
01:08:53,338 --> 01:08:54,880
No word yet from de silva.

755
01:08:55,047 --> 01:08:56,338
- Well, keep trying.
- Yes, sir.

756
01:08:56,505 --> 01:08:58,172
Help! Help!

757
01:08:58,338 --> 01:08:59,547
Tyler!

758
01:08:59,797 --> 01:09:00,838
Barclay!

759
01:09:01,005 --> 01:09:02,005
Are you okay, Tyler?

760
01:09:02,172 --> 01:09:05,422
Well, looks like we got
ourselves a little pow.

761
01:09:05,588 --> 01:09:07,672
Barclay, you were right. Charles is bad.

762
01:09:07,838 --> 01:09:09,005
He tried to hurt me.

763
01:09:09,297 --> 01:09:10,380
Who the hell's Charles?

764
01:09:10,547 --> 01:09:12,880
Come in, barclay. Come in.

765
01:09:14,047 --> 01:09:15,088
Who the hell is that?

766
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:17,588
It's Charles.

767
01:09:20,463 --> 01:09:21,505
Who is this?

768
01:09:21,672 --> 01:09:24,297
Put barclay on, jarhead.

769
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:27,172
It's the reds.
They're up to something.

770
01:09:28,505 --> 01:09:29,547
What do you want?

771
01:09:29,713 --> 01:09:31,380
I want the kid.

772
01:09:31,547 --> 01:09:35,047
Bring him up to the oldjeep
or there 'ii be hell to pay.

773
01:09:35,213 --> 01:09:37,253
- Andy, don't do it!
- De silva!

774
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:38,713
You hear that, barclay?

775
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:41,380
Don't touch her,
you son of a bitch.

776
01:09:41,547 --> 01:09:44,255
Now, bring me the kid or I'll waste her.

777
01:09:48,130 --> 01:09:51,047
Red team, red team. Come in, red team.

778
01:09:51,838 --> 01:09:53,713
This is red team. Over.

779
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:56,505
We got a situation
up here at the old Jeep.

780
01:09:56,672 --> 01:10:00,213
Blue team sighted.
Advise you to move your troops in.

781
01:10:01,588 --> 01:10:03,672
I hope they like the taste of lead.

782
01:10:04,713 --> 01:10:07,963
Now just sit back
and watch the sparks fly.

783
01:10:15,505 --> 01:10:18,547
All right, you two are
gonna go on up ahead, draw 'em out.

784
01:10:18,713 --> 01:10:21,023
- The rest of us are gonna circle around.
- Shelton, this is no game.

785
01:10:21,047 --> 01:10:22,838
I'm telling you, this guy is dangerous.

786
01:10:23,005 --> 01:10:25,338
Relax, barclay. It's only paint.

787
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:27,588
All right. Let's do it.

788
01:10:38,797 --> 01:10:40,213
I'm scared, barclay.

789
01:10:41,130 --> 01:10:42,630
Yeah, me, too.

790
01:10:49,297 --> 01:10:52,213
All right, kid. Get over here!

791
01:10:54,588 --> 01:10:56,380
Don't fuck with me!

792
01:10:57,130 --> 01:10:59,422
I'll blow all of you to pieces!

793
01:11:07,922 --> 01:11:08,922
Beat it.

794
01:11:20,713 --> 01:11:23,797
Now, just get down and shut up.

795
01:11:30,588 --> 01:11:32,172
Yeah!

796
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:44,380
Hold your fire!

797
01:11:44,547 --> 01:11:45,547
Hold your fire!

798
01:11:49,255 --> 01:11:50,963
De silva, where the hell is everybody?

799
01:11:53,130 --> 01:11:54,547
Hi, soldier.

800
01:11:59,338 --> 01:12:00,547
Fuck me.

801
01:12:13,297 --> 01:12:14,588
All right!

802
01:12:17,338 --> 01:12:19,672
- Shit!
- Stay down!

803
01:12:19,838 --> 01:12:22,297
Jesus Christ. They're using live rounds!

804
01:12:36,047 --> 01:12:37,380
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

805
01:12:37,797 --> 01:12:39,422
Hold your fire!

806
01:12:51,130 --> 01:12:53,547
Oh, god, he's not breathing.
Get away from him!

807
01:12:54,588 --> 01:12:55,838
You did this, didn't you?

808
01:12:56,005 --> 01:12:57,713
You sick son of a bitch!

809
01:12:58,838 --> 01:13:00,422
Now I'm gonna kill you!

810
01:13:00,588 --> 01:13:02,297
Stop it! Get off of him!

811
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:05,023
- He didn't do it! Stop it!
- Let go of me! Let go of me!

812
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:08,130
Sayonara, suckers.

813
01:13:08,672 --> 01:13:09,872
No! Get off of him!

814
01:13:10,005 --> 01:13:12,047
Stop it! He didn't do it!

815
01:13:21,755 --> 01:13:23,047
Look out!

816
01:13:40,547 --> 01:13:42,672
No! Oh, my god, what happened?

817
01:13:42,838 --> 01:13:44,172
It's whitehurst.

818
01:13:44,338 --> 01:13:47,047
Oh, my god! Ellis, what happened?

819
01:13:47,213 --> 01:13:48,481
Epstein, what the hell happened?

820
01:13:48,505 --> 01:13:50,273
- I don't know.
- Who fucked with the rifles?!

821
01:13:50,297 --> 01:13:52,023
- I don't know!
- Okay. Okay.

822
01:13:52,047 --> 01:13:53,273
- Get Clark on the radio.
- Yes, sir!

823
01:13:53,297 --> 01:13:54,439
And get me a medic up here

824
01:13:54,463 --> 01:13:55,783
- right now!
- Yes, sir!

825
01:13:57,130 --> 01:13:58,713
All right. Everybody stay calm!

826
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:05,880
Epstein, I want that radio! Oh, god.

827
01:14:26,255 --> 01:14:27,856
This is the last time
I'm gonna tell you.

828
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:30,161
Give that thing a rest
or you're out of here, both of you.

829
01:14:30,213 --> 01:14:31,693
Come on, we're not bothering anybody.

830
01:14:31,838 --> 01:14:33,880
You're bothering me. Keep it down.

831
01:14:35,255 --> 01:14:36,547
Jeez!

832
01:14:44,213 --> 01:14:45,755
Mister, mister, you've got to help me.

833
01:14:45,922 --> 01:14:47,202
What's wrong? What's the matter?

834
01:14:47,338 --> 01:14:49,047
Charles! Charles, he's after me.

835
01:14:49,213 --> 01:14:51,172
- Who's Charles?
- He's a good guy!

836
01:14:51,338 --> 01:14:53,818
- He wants to play hide the soul.
- Okay, slow down, slow down!

837
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:56,130
Have a seat over there. Are you from Kent?

838
01:14:56,297 --> 01:14:58,047
- Yes, sir.
- What's your name, son?

839
01:14:59,713 --> 01:15:01,755
Ronald Tyler. Private first-class, sir.

840
01:15:01,922 --> 01:15:04,672
Have a seat. How about some gum, private?

841
01:15:06,213 --> 01:15:09,838
I know how it must hurt when a friend does
something bad to you.

842
01:15:10,005 --> 01:15:11,380
Sure does.

843
01:15:13,172 --> 01:15:15,922
But I bet your friend...
What's his name, Charles?

844
01:15:17,297 --> 01:15:19,130
I bet you Charles didn't mean it.

845
01:15:19,297 --> 01:15:20,505
I bet you he's really sorry.

846
01:15:21,047 --> 01:15:23,213
No, he isn't. He wants to hurt me.

847
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:24,630
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

848
01:15:25,213 --> 01:15:26,630
Hey, I know what will cheer you up.

849
01:15:27,213 --> 01:15:28,422
Look what I found.

850
01:15:36,047 --> 01:15:37,523
- Here's your prize.
- Here you go.

851
01:15:37,547 --> 01:15:38,547
Thank you, daddy.

852
01:15:38,713 --> 01:15:39,793
Let's go in the super loop.

853
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:41,005
Yeah.

854
01:16:02,255 --> 01:16:04,547
Hey. Hey, maybe somebody's seen him.

855
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:34,088
Oh, god.

856
01:16:37,047 --> 01:16:38,672
- Come on.
- Wait.

857
01:16:58,630 --> 01:17:01,047
Mommy, mommy, I loved it!

858
01:17:01,213 --> 01:17:02,880
- Were you scared?
- No!

859
01:17:03,047 --> 01:17:06,005
Let's have some popcorn
and go on one more ride.

860
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:10,797
Perfect. In there.

861
01:17:15,547 --> 01:17:18,088
Don't even think about it.

862
01:17:18,422 --> 01:17:19,880
- Come on.
- Okay.

863
01:17:29,547 --> 01:17:30,797
In there!

864
01:17:55,547 --> 01:17:57,422
Time to play.

865
01:17:58,505 --> 01:18:00,630
This looks good. Park it.

866
01:18:06,088 --> 01:18:07,255
Ah!

867
01:18:15,755 --> 01:18:16,880
Kid!

868
01:18:46,088 --> 01:18:47,130
Tyler!

869
01:18:47,297 --> 01:18:49,380
Barclay! Barclay! In here!

870
01:18:51,713 --> 01:18:53,255
He's got a gun!

871
01:18:58,380 --> 01:18:59,380
Kid!

872
01:19:05,755 --> 01:19:08,713
Are you okay? Oh, my god.

873
01:19:09,213 --> 01:19:11,005
Oh, god.

874
01:19:19,338 --> 01:19:21,713
Here. Take it.

875
01:19:23,797 --> 01:19:25,088
You can do it.

876
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:31,380
I'll be okay.

877
01:20:11,422 --> 01:20:13,797
Help! Help!

878
01:20:13,963 --> 01:20:16,963
- Help! Help!
- Yeah! You're mine now, Tyler!

879
01:21:23,672 --> 01:21:24,713
Tyler!

880
01:21:25,047 --> 01:21:26,088
Barclay!

881
01:21:26,255 --> 01:21:27,255
Tyler, watch out!

882
01:21:30,463 --> 01:21:31,672
Shit!

883
01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:00,297
This is it, kid! End of the line.

884
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:39,588
Give me the power, I beg of you!

885
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:11,130
Come on, keep both eyes open.
Hold your breath.

886
01:23:29,505 --> 01:23:30,588
Yeah!

887
01:23:36,630 --> 01:23:37,630
Are you okay?

888
01:23:38,713 --> 01:23:39,880
Yeah.

889
01:23:41,838 --> 01:23:43,078
Come on, let's get out of here.

890
01:23:47,130 --> 01:23:48,963
Hold on, Tyler! Hold on!

891
01:23:49,130 --> 01:23:51,380
Give me the fucking kid!
He's mine!

892
01:23:51,547 --> 01:23:52,838
Barclay, help!

893
01:23:53,005 --> 01:23:54,297
Mine! Give me the fucking kid!

894
01:23:54,463 --> 01:23:56,338
Hold on, Tyler. Hold on.

895
01:23:57,088 --> 01:23:58,963
He's mine!

896
01:23:59,130 --> 01:24:01,088
- Come on, hold on, Tyler.
- Barclay!

897
01:24:01,630 --> 01:24:03,838
Here. Take the knife!

898
01:24:04,005 --> 01:24:06,338
Give him to me!

899
01:24:06,505 --> 01:24:08,838
Take it! Here, take it!

900
01:24:09,005 --> 01:24:10,213
- Barclay!
- Hold on!

901
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:13,755
- Reach for it!
- He's mine!

902
01:24:40,005 --> 01:24:41,797
Tyler, come on. I got you.

903
01:25:04,713 --> 01:25:06,088
Okay, we're on our way in.

904
01:25:06,255 --> 01:25:07,922
Roger.

905
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:11,672
You'll have to come with us now, son.

906
01:25:13,672 --> 01:25:15,005
Are you gonna be okay?

907
01:25:15,713 --> 01:25:18,255
Don't worry. I've been here before.

908
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:24,338
Watch your head.
