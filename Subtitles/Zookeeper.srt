2
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,555
It's beautiful, right?
it's great.

3
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:49,591
Hey.

4
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,477
What's that?
What?

5
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:55,310
Check it out.
Hey.

6
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,144
Okay.

7
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,159
Hey, there's a note in it.
Get out of here.

8
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,240
Yes, there is. It says:

9
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,000
- "Will you mar... "
- -Stephanie?

10
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:21,423
It's no secret
we've been on a journey together.

11
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,167
An adventure.

12
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:27,972
And I've done a lot of soul searching,
and I know...

13
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:30,595
this is just right.

14
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,389
So will you marry me?

15
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:39,020
That's so sweet. No.

16
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:41,356
Sorry?

17
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,187
I can't.

18
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:45,689
Really?

19
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:51,279
I really didn't wanna do this right now
but you're kind of forcing my hand. Um...

20
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,823
I'm thinking we've reached
the end of the line.

21
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,492
Really?

22
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:02,381
Look, Griffin, I know it shouldn't
bother me that you're a zookeeper,

23
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,007
but it kind of does.

24
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,960
And when we first started
dating, I just assumed

25
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,677
that you would turn into the guy that
I'd always dreamed of being with.

26
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,591
But...
Not your dream guy, I got it.

27
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,101
You had to see this coming.

28
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,224
I bought a ring and rented a horse.

29
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:19,557
Well, that's not my fault!
Don't yell at me on the beach!

30
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:22,393
I love...
Stop it!

31
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,187
Do not make this harder
than it has to be. God!

32
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,693
You totally set me up.

33
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:37,829
Little heads up.
I may have hired a mariachi band.

34
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,499
Oh, there they are.

35
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:42,709
Just ignore them.

36
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:55,175
Ignore it.

37
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:14,490
Thank you, sir.
There you go.

38
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,506
Good morning, Barry.

39
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,851
Come on, Donald, let's move
you out of the sun. Come on.

40
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:46,063
There you go, buddy.
Nice and shady.

41
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,739
Cherry.
Thanks, Franky.

42
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,657
See you at the party tonight.

43
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,577
Come on, Shane.
What are you doing?

44
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,162
We talked about this.

45
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:06,205
His food should always be fresh and
placed inside the door out of the sun.

46
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:09,341
You go down there.
I am not getting jacked up by him again.

47
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,511
It's been 10 years.
Bernie's cool.

48
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:15,180
Why do you bring
this stuff around here?

49
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,466
You trying to make
the rest of us look bad?

50
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,017
What? No, no.

51
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:21,929
I feel for him.
He's all alone.

52
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,855
Oh, he's all alone.

53
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,767
Look, it all starts with trust.

54
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,273
Sure.

55
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:33,111
You won't be so cocky when he's beating
you to death with your own arm.

56
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,921
Hey, Bern.
Got a little something for you.

57
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:03,395
Looks like things
just got fun around here, huh?

58
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,850
What is this, anyway?

59
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:08,483
Is this an old tire
or a gateway to adventure?

60
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,233
It's... it's adventure.

61
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,365
It's an adventure.

62
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,576
Hey, Tony. Go.

63
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:30,501
Hey. How did it go
with the tire swing?

64
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,425
Oh, that good, huh?

65
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,256
Don't know
if he's gonna come around.

66
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:39,013
Don't get discouraged. Bernie feels what
you're trying to do. All the animals do.

67
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:42,058
You're like the hippo Whisperer.
I don't know.

68
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,261
Hey, is that
the new release cage?

69
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:45,561
Yep.

70
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,270
The eagle enclosure's almost done.
I gotta tell you, it is amazing.

71
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,150
Great job.
Thank you.

72
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,856
It's getting a lot of attention.

73
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,239
In fact, I may be sitting on
an offer to work my magic

74
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:59,493
at the Nairobi Zoo in Africa.

75
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,366
Oh, man.
Ahh...

76
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,414
Wow, that's awesome.
Congratulations.

77
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,787
I'm thinking about it, but...

78
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,122
It's great to be wanted.

79
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:09,628
You know how that feels.

80
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,171
Oh, I've been in play.

81
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:14,674
There was a zoo in New Hampshire that
was coming after me pretty hard.

82
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,336
It wasn't so much a zoo.
It was more an animal farm.

83
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,387
But the animals
were nice. Cool.

84
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,344
Not big like here.
We didn't have the...

85
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,759
They had a couple badgers.
A badger and a...

86
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,516
They had a sick raccoon. Sick.

87
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:29,147
His name was Peter
and he was big.

88
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,982
Hang in there, girl.

89
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,188
Whoa.
What happened?

90
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,853
She's having trouble breathing.
What's happening?

91
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,988
She's stable and She's sedated.

92
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,691
I'm gonna get a trach tube.
Oh, my God. Okay.

93
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,571
What do we do, Kate?
Don't panic, Griffin.

94
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,455
Not breathing. Support her neck.

95
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:49,835
On my count. One, two, and...

96
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,288
She's a big girl.
She's a big girl.

97
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:55,881
Griffin, you okay?
Yeah.

98
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:59,386
There's something blocking her airway.
I need a laryngoscope.

99
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,515
I don't know what a laryngo...
it's in the drawer.

100
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,386
Okay, I got Post-its,
cinnamon Tic Tacs...

101
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:10,772
It's silver, curved and has a light on it.
Got it.

102
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:13,525
Come on. There's definitely
something in her throat.

103
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:15,727
Hold her jaw open.
I'm putting my hand in.

104
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,441
It's stuck.
No, come on.

105
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,319
Oh, God. Okay.

106
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,115
I guess I'm up.
I can't...

107
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,696
Come on.
Okay, I'll hold.

108
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,658
Hold the jaw.
Come on, you can do it.

109
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,206
That's a feeling
I never wanna get used to.

110
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,788
Hurry, hurry.
You can do it, you can do it.

111
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:31,998
I got it.

112
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,747
She's breathing.

113
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,046
Good luck getting the deposit
back on that one.

114
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,923
You did it.

115
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,633
No, we did it.

116
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,181
We did it.

117
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,264
She's okay.

118
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:51,305
Oh, God. You're okay.

119
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:57,523
I You supply the night I

120
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:00,314
♪ Baby, I'll supply the love ♪

121
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,154
This place looks amazing,
Griffin. No.

122
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:06,783
Grif, Mom and Dad would have loved this.
Thank you.

123
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,697
Kate.
Hi, Dave.

124
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,784
That's... Kate heads up our eagle program.
That's Robin.

125
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,920
- This is Venom, he is our reptile guy.
- Hey.

126
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,373
How are you?
Oh, you gotta bring it in with him.

127
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,416
Mm. Now onto the fiancée.

128
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,298
Okay, Venom, reel it in.

129
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,637
- Okay, that feels good.
- Yeah. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

130
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,014
Hey, come on.
No, you're not married yet.

131
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,648
Congrats on your big day.

132
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:39,228
I don't know where you kids are going
for your honeymoon, but Omaha,

133
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,943
stupid with
underground fight clubs.

134
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,280
Okay. Um...

135
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,036
We're gonna circulate.
Yeah.

136
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,367
All right.
Congrats on being hot.

137
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,000
I gots to gets my flows on.

138
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,457
All right, folks.

139
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,960
I'd like to bring up the guy
who is responsible

140
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:04,048
for putting together
this little party-slash-field trip.

141
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,554
Dave's brother, Griffin.

142
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:09,053
Whoo! Griffin.

143
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,888
Griffin.

144
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,099
Are you going with Floyd?
Oh, yeah.

145
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,226
Go get them.
I'm getting them.

146
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,728
Let's hear it for him.

147
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:21,395
Love.

148
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:24,573
We're all here tonight
to celebrate one thing,

149
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:26,696
and that's love.

150
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,494
You know, finding the perfect mate

151
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:32,740
is the most important thing
in the world.

152
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,575
No matter what package
they come in.

153
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,128
I mean, you take Floyd here.

154
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:41,415
Now, porcupines, they...
They get a bad rap, you know?

155
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:46,671
And I'm sure you see the sharp quills
and the tough exterior.

156
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:49,051
But you know what I see?

157
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:52,350
Just a great guy looking for love.

158
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:56,976
And that's what Robin sees
in my brother Dave.

159
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,978
Aw.

160
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,228
- To the couple.
- Yeah.

161
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,528
To you guys.

162
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,026
Congratulations.

163
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,575
- All right.
- To Dave and Robin!

164
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,449
Hi.

165
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,283
I... I...

166
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,123
God, what was I, uh... ?
Ahem. Heh.

167
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,628
I, uh...

168
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,539
Sorry, I just lost my train of...

169
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,423
I got a train of... Train.

170
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:27,426
What I'm basically saying is...
I mean, I'm not...

171
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,301
May not be an expert on love,
you know,

172
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,510
per se.

173
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:35,052
But I do know a lot about animals.

174
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,230
He's an indigenous...
He's a woodland creature. Ahem.

175
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:39,731
Did I cover burrowing?

176
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:44,269
Did I go over burrow
because I don't know if I got... ?

177
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:48,198
I had a whole thing on burrow.
Did it get hotter, 10 degrees hotter?

178
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,279
Where did that breeze go?
It is hot.

179
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,739
My elbows are sweating.
That's weird.

180
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:55,697
I don't know why I'm telling
you this now. Oh, boy.

181
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:58,868
I had so many beautiful things...
I'm just gonna sum up.

182
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:02,333
I think sum it up,
what I wanted to say.

183
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:07,050
Dave, Robert, good luck.
That's really what it comes down to.

184
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:11,054
And anybody who wants to
learn more about porcupines,

185
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,590
I'll be off to the side over here.

186
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,012
♪ Carry on, my wayward son ♪

187
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,978
Yeah. Food for thought,
ladies and gentlemen.

188
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,562
You invited Stephanie?
Sorry to jump you like that.

189
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:30,858
I didn't even know Robin was
gonna invite her. I'm an idiot.

190
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,986
You still got a thing for her,
don't you?

191
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:41,035
So, Stephanie, I saw the way
that you were looking at Griffin.

192
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,710
Is something going on?

193
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,588
I don't know.

194
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,209
I guess I feel bad about the
way things ended between us.

195
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,261
I might've been a little rough on him.
A little?

196
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,218
Okay, Robin, a lot.
I'll own it.

197
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:58,385
Seeing him tonight and up there
in his little uniform and...

198
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,928
So cute.

199
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:06,689
I don't know, it just reminds me
that he has so much potential.

200
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,446
You deserve a great girl in your life.

201
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:11,823
But you gotta understand
how the world works.

202
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:16,115
What's wrong with being a zookeeper?
Nothing, you're the best, okay?

203
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,494
It's just...

204
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,076
Look.

205
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,333
Offer's still on the table
to work at the dealership.

206
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,995
Okay? Because here's you,
the grass, mine's greener.

207
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,796
Dave.
No, I'm serious.

208
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,840
You could make
your annual salary in a month.

209
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,636
That is how you get a girl
like Stephanie.

210
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:37,340
Come on, this could be
a whole new life for you.

211
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:40,810
Think about it.

212
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,228
Yeah.

213
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:45,641
Floyd, right?

214
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,227
I hope my being here doesn't
make you uncomfortable.

215
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:52,443
I'm not uncomfortable.
So comfortable.

216
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,731
Ah! Ah.

217
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,525
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

218
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,615
No, it's fine, it's fine. I got it.

219
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,654
Oh, God, it's barbed.

220
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:02,495
Okay, so, hey, how you doing?
Still in design school?

221
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,952
No, no, I've been out for a while.
Okay.

222
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,496
I'm a buyer for Saks now.
Oh, that's good.

223
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:10,040
I see you've been busy.
Lead Zookeeper.

224
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,876
Yes, yeah. You know,
I got the bump last year.

225
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,511
They don't usually until
you've been here 10 years.

226
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,887
I'm only been here eight.

227
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:20,391
It's basically like getting a black belt
after only a month of karate.

228
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,848
Or mastering a, uh...

229
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,187
Let's see. Um.

230
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,395
That's all I can think of right now.

231
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,401
Just karate, go with that.
Yeah.

232
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,603
So it's good.
Wow.

233
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,564
Yeah.

234
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,404
That's good.

235
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:38,743
Oh, Griffin, you're bleeding.

236
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,991
No, no.
Yes, yes, you are.

237
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,781
Come here.

238
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:46,417
Let me get it, come...
I'm not gonna bite.

239
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:48,919
There.

240
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,545
There you go.
Now you're all better.

241
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,426
Anyway, Robin was talking about

242
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:04,095
wanting to see
the animals tomorrow,

243
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,724
and we're wondering what are the
odds of getting a private tour?

244
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,267
Not good. Not good at all.

245
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:14,028
There's a sign-up sheet,
a pretty elaborate waiver.

246
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:18,033
And you'd have to go through the main
office, which is closed. They close at 4.

247
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,661
Yeah, doesn't sound good.
It's not.

248
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,613
Okay, so we're on our own.

249
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:27,368
Well, it was really nice to see you.
Okay.

250
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,001
You know?

251
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,333
Bye, Floyd.

252
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,256
Bye, Griffin.

253
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,511
Dave's right.

254
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:44,847
I gotta get out of this zoo.

255
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:50,185
- Closing up shop again, Grif?
- Yeah, just had to clean up.

256
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:51,895
Meeting.

257
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,026
Let's do this. Come on.

258
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:25,262
What? Oh, nothing.

259
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,098
I wasn't cleaning my basement.

260
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,776
Okay. Here we go.

261
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,787
If this is another eating intervention,
I'm not hearing it.

262
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,449
This is my ideal weight.
Ask the vet.

263
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:50,954
Come on. Pop the latch.

264
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,915
Yeah, let's go. We want a good seat.

265
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,045
- What do you think this is?
- Am I psychic?

266
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:58,458
We got the call the same time.
Take it down a peg, just asking.

267
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,883
Bernie.

268
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,883
Hey, we having a meeting.
You wanna come?

269
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,968
You don't.
Don't know why I asked.

270
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:07,221
Come on.
We're gonna have a meeting.

271
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,477
I'm excited about this.

272
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:14,766
- I wonder.
- What's going on?

273
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,444
All right.
I got a very busy schedule.

274
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:19,855
This better be good.

275
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:22,865
You sleep 20 hours a day, Joe.
I think you'll live.

276
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:26,449
Okay, things I didn't want
the group to know.

277
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,995
Look, we got a problem.

278
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:32,076
Remember that chick that broke Griffin's heart?
Well, she is back.

279
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:35,002
What?
What, Stephanie's back? Whoa.

280
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,708
This is not good.

281
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:39,750
Griffin's thinking of quitting.
We can't let that happen.

282
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:42,460
He can't leave.
He's the best zookeeper we ever had.

283
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:46,468
He keeps my hay fresh and he rubs
lotion on me when I get dry skin.

284
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,175
He makes papier-maché antelopes
for me to attack.

285
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,936
And inside? Muffins.

286
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,356
Oh, I like muffins.
Can I get a "Hey now"?

287
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:58,810
Plus, he's the only human
who recognizes me as an equal.

288
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,065
In your dreams.

289
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:02,856
Thumbs, baby.
It's all about the thumbs.

290
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:04,111
What do you call this?

291
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,368
That's a paw. You can't grab
a coffee mug with that.

292
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,196
You can't wear mittens.
It's useless.

293
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:11,656
I'm so blessed.

294
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,034
Sorry. One more look.

295
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:16,836
Griffin saved my life.

296
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,040
Right, I made my decision.
We're not helping Griffin.

297
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:24,048
Really? Because I remember a time
when you needed help with females.

298
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:26,425
Namely me.
Remember, you were shy.

299
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:29,932
You sent your buddy over
to test the waters to make sure.

300
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:32,310
And then you would, like,
follow me around.

301
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,891
I'd look at you,
you'd look away embarrassed.

302
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,601
Okay. We're helping Griffin.

303
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:40,314
Now, how do you propose we do it?
Animals are experts on mating.

304
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,320
We tell him how to get her back.
No.

305
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:45,273
Nobody's talking to Griffin.

306
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:49,239
You know the code.
We don't ever talk to humans.

307
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,195
You don't break the code,
idiot.

308
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:53,456
Besides, Griffin's got
no shot at this girl.

309
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:56,993
That is why you're single, Bruce.
You have no sense of romance.

310
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,206
Herbivore.

311
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:01,415
Maybe it's possible to help
Griffin without talking to him.

312
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:04,671
The girl's gonna be here tomorrow
and she's interested.

313
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,252
And how do you know that?

314
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:11,391
She said, and I quote, "Griffin
has potential." Potential.

315
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:14,595
All we have to do is make him
look like a hero in front of her.

316
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,765
Then zip-zang, Griffin gets
the girl, stays at the zoo,

317
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,225
everybody wins.

318
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,151
Awesome. We got a plan.

319
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,523
Whoa!
Hey, what's this now?

320
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,359
Wait. You're not
a zoo animal.

321
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,900
Excuse me. Am I standing in the zoo?
Then I'm a zoo animal.

322
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:33,659
Don't get mad at us because no kid
says, "Mommy, I wanna see a crow."

323
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,957
Okay, that's the captivity talking.

324
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:39,331
Enough. You've all made your
point, we'll help Griffin.

325
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,121
But no one breaks the code.

326
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,332
- Understood?
- No breaking the code.

327
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,884
Okay, we're helping a human.
This is big.

328
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,711
You started your diet today.

329
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,006
He's not even chewing.
Take a breath.

330
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:54,142
What, I'm stress-eating.
Stop looking at me!

331
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:57,095
Much better than the tire we had.

332
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,605
Sorry about that, by the way.

333
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,687
You're gonna enjoy this
a lot more.

334
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,944
I don't know. I made it,
I drilled it and put a ball in there.

335
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,776
Get that baby spinning,
have it land in a circle.

336
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,566
What? Winner, winner,
chicken dinner.

337
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,573
I think you'll like it.
There. There you go.

338
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:16,907
I'm not sure, kind of like a disco ball.
Look at that. Whoa.

339
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,746
Party at Bernie's. it's fun.

340
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,501
It's gonna be good.

341
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:26,086
It sucks being alone here, buddy.
I know.

342
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,084
All right.

343
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,342
Okay.

344
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,886
See you tomorrow, Bern.

345
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,472
I don't know.
She just intimidates me, you know?

346
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:39,888
But you know me.
I don't like to talk about it.

347
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,689
Hey, Griffin.

348
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,232
Hey, Grif.

349
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,524
Hey.

350
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,482
We were gonna
go see the rhinos,

351
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:49,523
and we were wondering
if you could show us the way.

352
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:53,034
Uh... You know what?
I can't right now.

353
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,660
I'm feeding the giraffe.

354
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,071
She's eating carrots.

355
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,327
Okay.

356
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:09,755
Here they come.

357
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,345
See the thumb?
Yeah, yeah, I see it.

358
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:15,302
Time to make Griffin
look like a hero.

359
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,843
Here we go. Get it together.

360
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,431
All right, here you go.

361
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:23,188
Anybody looking? No.

362
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:35,868
Oh, my God.
Joe.

363
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,243
Joe, over here.

364
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,114
Please. This way.

365
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,909
Get them out of there, I'll distract him.
Got it.

366
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,745
Joe.

367
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,175
Oh, crap.

368
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,760
Get in.

369
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,269
Oh, God.

370
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,153
Joe.

371
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,980
Joe? Joe.

372
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:15,863
- Oy.
- Joe.

373
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,036
Joe.

374
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,874
Joe.

375
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:28,254
Joe.

376
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,206
What the hell is wrong with you?

377
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:32,876
Huh?
Oh, I mean:

378
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,056
Wait a sec.
Aah!

379
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,931
Griffin, I know this is weird.

380
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:46,765
Griffin.
Lion secure, going home.

381
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:59,326
Haven't you learned anything
from being under my tutelage?

382
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:16,761
No. No.

383
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:36,072
Mommy, look, it's going to eat.
Come on.

384
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,651
Yeah, it's on, but, like, on reverse.

385
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:41,660
Yeah, you should definitely go.

386
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:45,244
He, uh...
Wasn't saying anything, did he?

387
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:49,126
What's going on?

388
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:51,629
J' Down by the river N

389
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:55,962
He's a good one, yeah.
How much do they weigh?

390
00:22:58,252 --> 00:22:59,674
What's up?

391
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:06,268
Good night, Griffin.
Good night, Manny. Heading home?

392
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,771
If by "home"
you mean Uncle Bosoms,

393
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:11,523
I'll be there in the back,
purple couch.

394
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,021
Okay.

395
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,272
All right.

396
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:15,857
I know you had your dinner,

397
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:21,868
but this is just a little reward for
what I like to call a winning attitude.

398
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:24,404
You care to comment on that?

399
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:27,243
Yeah, I didn't think so. Okay.

400
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,204
Have a good one.

401
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,668
You wanna talk? Let's talk.

402
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,888
You remember nothing.

403
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:54,730
You remember nothing.

404
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:56,439
I totally think this is working.

405
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:03,075
Relax. Calm down, calm down.

406
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,325
Breathe. Breathe.

407
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,244
Take it easy. Take it easy.

408
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,823
He's freaking out.
Look at him, look at him.

409
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:11,083
What do you think I'm looking at?

410
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,411
You can talk.
Yeah, we can talk.

411
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,045
I can sing pretty good.

412
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:17,748
I can teach you
how to give yourself a bath.

413
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:19,542
How did you get out
of your enclosures?

414
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,335
You don't wanna know.

415
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:25,632
Actually, I do.
Okay, but I don't wanna tell you.

416
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:27,717
How long have you been
able to talk?

417
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:31,638
Let's see. Today's Tuesday,
so always.

418
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:32,892
Always.

419
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,399
Then why haven't you?
Humans can't handle it.

420
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,901
Any time we talk to
humans, it always ends badly.

421
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,064
Except for parrots.
Somehow they get away with it.

422
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,988
"l be parrot.
Happy birthday."

423
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,444
Why did you talk to me?

424
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,830
You saved my mate.
We tried to help you connect with yours.

425
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,161
But you blew it.

426
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:53,038
I appreciate it,
but you know what?

427
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,295
I had a really bad experience
and I don't like to talk about it.

428
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,330
"Don't like to talk about it."

429
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,425
That's crazy.

430
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:05,926
We've been hearing about that
breakup on the beach every day

431
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:07,431
for the last five years.

432
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:11,139
Okay, I might have mentioned it before
I knew you could understand me.

433
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:14,521
Come on, man, we heard her talking.
She wants you.

434
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:19,319
So what if you don't have my great
complexion or my thick, wavy hair?

435
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:23,026
I would tell you this.
You have nice calves.

436
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,324
Great calves.
Of course I don't have calves.

437
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,826
I basically have columns
with toenails.

438
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,405
So you think I should
maybe ask her out?

439
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,541
Okay. All right, now,
slow it down, hot shot.

440
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:37,211
You ask Stephanie out,
it's gonna end the same way.

441
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,963
You haven't changed,
you don't trust your instincts.

442
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:43,626
You listen to us and we turn
you into an alpha male.

443
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:45,086
I don't know.

444
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:47,046
I don't think
he's got the size.

445
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:50,216
Size has nothing to do with it.
We both know who the alpha is.

446
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:54,387
You're giving me attitude.
That's why I do stuff to your water bowl.

447
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,056
That was you?
You said it was vitamin drops.

448
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,766
Surprise.
Oh, that's it.

449
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,102
Bring it, come on.
it's been brought.

450
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,653
Oh, boy, here we go again.

451
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:05,481
It's like watching a fight
between two beanbag chairs.

452
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,532
I am tired. I'm back in.
Me too.

453
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:10,740
You're a good man, Griffin.
You just need a little help.

454
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,997
Yeah. Who better than us
to help you?

455
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:15,291
- Come on, you honeypot.
- Bring it, big boy.

456
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:16,621
What have I got to lose?

457
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,038
That's not instilling confidence.
Sorry.

458
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,374
Two more licks.

459
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:27,879
Is it on, is it on, is it on? Yeah.

460
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,148
Hey.

461
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:42,476
Thought we'd mix things up
a little today.

462
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:46,398
Got some organic jambalaya.

463
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:53,287
You know...

464
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,242
If you ever, uh...

465
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:57,951
You want anything, I...

466
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,579
You could always ask me.

467
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,039
Hey, how's the, uh...?

468
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:06,129
How's that ball working out for you?

469
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,669
Lot of fun with the...

470
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,879
Any disco

471
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:13,841
parties?

472
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,894
All right.

473
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,777
Just leave it by the door.

474
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:40,667
Come on.

475
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:43,792
Move. Come on, stupid bears.

476
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,748
Do something.

477
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:47,003
What is he doing?

478
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:48,964
Hey. Don't do that.

479
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:50,636
No, no, no. Hey.

480
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,796
Whoa!

481
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,428
Can we get that?

482
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:08,779
Okay.
Now, no sudden movements.

483
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:11,653
I want you to get to your feet.
Slowly walk to the door.

484
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,198
Come on.

485
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,283
They're not gonna hurt you.
Good.

486
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,919
Okay, we're fine, here.
Here we go.

487
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,872
He backed you down.
I didn't see you do anything.

488
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:32,969
Hey, thanks, guys.

489
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:35,218
I appreciate you showing
some restraint.

490
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,303
Any other day,
that would've been lunch.

491
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:39,013
But you showed confidence,

492
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:41,053
what you're not doing with the girl.

493
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,688
See, when I take down a female, I...

494
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:46,726
Whoa. Take down a female, you?
Don't know me my whole life.

495
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,815
I did three years in Vancouver.

496
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:52,023
You got a chick in Canada?
Yeah, I was dating a Kodiak model.

497
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:54,237
Kodiak model?
She's technically a model.

498
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,446
She was on a tobacco can,

499
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:56,781
born with an extra claw.

500
00:28:56,944 --> 00:28:58,070
She knew how to use it.

501
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:00,160
Canadian bears are wild.

502
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:01,456
Very wild.

503
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:04,368
She's wild in your dreams.
You don't know squat, Jerome.

504
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,624
Were you there, huh?

505
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:08,164
I didn't think so.

506
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:10,374
And what's with the "Jerome"?

507
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,666
Anyway,

508
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,460
you need to unlock
your inner bear.

509
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:16,218
The only way that's gonna happen
is to do as we say.

510
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,594
And that's how you get your girl.
We get it.

511
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,304
Let's start with your walk.

512
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:23,888
My... Come on, my walk is fine.
Fine? It's a not, stinking pile.

513
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,848
This time he's got a point.
Come on.

514
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:28,104
Show us your stuff.
Yup.

515
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:29,519
My... This is stupid.

516
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:32,029
My walk?
Wipe that goofy look off your face.

517
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,780
You're a predator.
Act like it.

518
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:36,317
Get those paws up.
That's what we do.

519
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,281
What was that?

520
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,411
No, no, no.
This guy's untrainable.

521
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,787
We're wasting our time.

522
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:44,245
Give me one more shot.
Come on, get your paw up.

523
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,122
Yeah, up.
Come on, reach.

524
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:48,538
This is ridiculous.
We know what we're doing.

525
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:50,047
Trust it.
Get your paws up.

526
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:52,378
There you go.
That's what we're talking about.

527
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:53,633
Let's see movement.

528
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:55,928
Swing your paws like
you're swatting salmon.

529
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:57,759
- Good.
- I don't know, man.

530
00:29:57,963 --> 00:29:59,965
Give us a snort.
Good old bear snort.

531
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:03,977
Not with your nose, with your mouth.
Get your lips into it.

532
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:06,931
- There you go.
- Yeah.

533
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,767
Now lead with your pudding cup.
My pudding cup?

534
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:13,403
Yeah, your pudding cup, man.
Get it out front. Remove the mystery.

535
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:15,943
That's good like that.

536
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:18,025
Who... ?
How would this ever help me?

537
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,861
- Show them the goods.
- This just feels weird.

538
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:23,702
That's it, looks good.
Come on. Add a roar.

539
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:25,866
- Rawr.
- The roar.

540
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:29,704
Put some oomph into it.

541
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:30,958
Roar.

542
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:32,464
- Fine.
- Bend those knees.

543
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:33,756
Get low.
Yeah.

544
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:36,543
Shake that money-maker.
Swing those arms.

545
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,303
Here's a predator.
Dig a hole.

546
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:40,385
- Dig a big old bear hole.
- Dig it.

547
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,015
- Get dirty.
- Stop digging.

548
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:44,017
No, keep digging.
Keep digging.

549
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,265
- What, are you too good to dig?
- That's it.

550
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:48,101
Through the wickets.
That's good.

551
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:50,933
Kick up those woodchips.
Look at him, a natural.

552
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,147
Scratch your back.
Scratch it on the tree.

553
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,733
Yeah, he's a bear.
Yeah, he's a bear, baby.

554
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:58,524
You're the bear.
You're a big bear.

555
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:03,362
Stop it.

556
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:09,751
Hi, kids.

557
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,584
Carry them all?

558
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:16,383
We'll look at the giraffe now.

559
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,095
I appreciate the grub.

560
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:28,558
No problem.
I popped it myself, so enjoy.

561
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,849
I would have left it in longer.
I like mine burnt a bit.

562
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,393
But I wasn't sure
how you weighed in on that.

563
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:35,944
This is fine.

564
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,490
Hey, Shane.

565
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:45,829
I was supposed to tell you
there's a meeting tomorrow at 10.

566
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,498
Okay, cool. Thanks.

567
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:51,497
Who are you talking to?

568
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,708
No, you know what it is?
Um...

569
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,373
I'm in a one-act play,

570
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,837
and I was rehearsing.

571
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:01,466
I know both parts because
I'm understudying the other guy.

572
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,050
And something.

573
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:04,677
Hm.

574
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,638
What's the play about?

575
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,390
Steam ships.

576
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:13,853
I wouldn't do it around him.

577
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,735
That's when they get you, you see?

578
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,113
When you're not focused.

579
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:26,953
I didn't do it, you know.

580
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:30,244
I'm sorry?
I didn't attack him.

581
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,414
Oh, yeah,
he says you did though.

582
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,541
He's a liar, okay?

583
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:38,669
He never treats us
with any respect.

584
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:41,335
To get us to move,
he prods us with a long stick

585
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,048
with a nail in the end of it.

586
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:46,636
One day, I guess I wasn't walking
fast as he wanted me to,

587
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:51,679
so he swung the stick at me, but I
caught it, and he slipped and fell.

588
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:55,600
He told everyone I attacked him.

589
00:32:57,434 --> 00:33:00,062
Wow, I never knew any of that.

590
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:06,073
And my only mistake was assuming
he would tell the truth.

591
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:09,408
I guess that's what humans do.

592
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:11,578
They lie.

593
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:15,585
Not all humans, Bernie.

594
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:18,379
Look, now,
maybe you got a raw deal,

595
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,254
but sometimes we need
to put the past behind us

596
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:24,761
and look towards the future,
you know?

597
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:31,393
I guess sometimes
we all get stuck living in the past.

598
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:34,934
Yeah.

599
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,315
Look, is there anything else
I can do for you?

600
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:39,314
Can you get me my view back?

601
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:44,031
You know, it's not my call.

602
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:47,735
I miss it, you know?
Seeing the world.

603
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:50,279
I used to be able
to climb high enough

604
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:53,787
that I could just catch a glimpse
of a few buildings.

605
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:57,957
Now all I see is cement.

606
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:01,874
I wish I could help you, Bernie, but...
I mean, that enclosure's gone.

607
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,135
It's a...
It's where the snack bar is now.

608
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:08,926
All right.

609
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:11,926
Do you mind if I ask you
a question?

610
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,180
Anything.

611
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:17,765
Is T.G.l. Friday's
as incredible as it looks?

612
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:19,725
It's pretty good.

613
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:22,777
Your girl's gonna be at the party.
Here's how we get her.

614
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:27,237
First, answer me this, what do you
think attracts a female to a male?

615
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:28,821
Looks, success...

616
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,572
Ehh. I'm gonna stop you
right there.

617
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,829
It's pee-pee.
Sorry?

618
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:38,085
Pee-pee. Smell, scent, chemistry, pheromones.
Bong-ba-da-bong.

619
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:40,962
Which is why you have to learn
to protect your territory.

620
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:44,291
Turn everything into a home game.
There's gotta be another way.

621
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:47,173
There's not. Now,
don't be stingy with the magic.

622
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,087
Watch and learn.

623
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,759
Notice the full extension
of my lift leg.

624
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:57,805
The proud, soaring arc of my stream.
Yeah.

625
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:00,311
See how I raised the bar
from the last pee mark.

626
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,942
And voilá.

627
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:04,269
You're up, sunshine.

628
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:07,321
You know,
I really don't feel like doing this.

629
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,450
The zoo is closed.
You're fine.

630
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,573
All right.

631
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,075
Not there. That's my spot.

632
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,078
Hey, don't give me attitude.

633
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,209
This will help you
at the dinner tonight.

634
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:21,870
Right here. Fine.

635
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:24,711
All right, unzip and make it rain.

636
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:27,592
Okay, you gotta look away.

637
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,511
Such a delicate flower.

638
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:38,808
Shut it down. Shut it down.

639
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,347
Kate's coming.
What?

640
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:41,890
I can't.
Snap it.

641
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,270
Be a man. Snap it.

642
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,028
Hey, Griffin,
Rebecca and I are going...

643
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:48,564
- Hey.
- Whoa!

644
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:50,239
Hey.

645
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,025
It's gonna be
hard to unsee that.

646
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:55,821
I'm sorry about that, I...
You know what happened...

647
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,490
The wolf got stung
by one of Venom's Scorpions.

648
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:01,251
And I was taking him
to the infirmary

649
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:06,673
and then he started limping bad.

650
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:10,927
Oh, and the urine will
neutralize the poison.

651
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:15,136
Exactly, exactly, yes, yes.
And that's why I did it.

652
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:19,186
I was just peeing on him,
for his health.

653
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:23,607
Okay, when you finish, I'll give him
an antihistamine just to be safe.

654
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:25,730
Sounds good.
All right, go ahead.

655
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:29,647
Hm?
Go ahead. Soak it.

656
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:34,818
Make sure you get
the whole area.

657
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:36,031
Sorry.

658
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,705
I have to.

659
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:44,828
Lather, rinse, repeat.

660
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:53,340
Excuse me, sir.

661
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:57,391
You do know that we have a functioning
restroom not 20 feet from here.

662
00:36:57,549 --> 00:37:00,598
Oh, you do, good, that sounds good.
Yeah, that's nice.

663
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,387
Have a good evening.
You too.

664
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:04,689
Hey, how's it going?
Good.

665
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:08,193
I've set up my territory, I'm about
to show Stephanie my pudding cup.

666
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:09,398
What?

667
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:14,191
Yeah, thank you.
Pretty great party, huh?

668
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,117
Yeah, Dave goes all out.

669
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,660
He really does.

670
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:21,540
Listen, Stephanie, I was thinking,

671
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:24,451
weddings can be weird
if you're alone and you...

672
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:27,503
Oh, God.
Oh. Oh.

673
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,539
No, no, don't.
No, it's not you.

674
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:30,753
It's, it's...

675
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:34,636
Oh, it's my ex, I broke up with him,
but he showed up here anyway.

676
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:37,009
Sweetness.
Funny story.

677
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:39,971
So I go to the fridge to
replenish the old electrolytes

678
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:42,761
after some cross-training,
and there,

679
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:46,397
taped to the door, next to the
picture of that kayak I'm getting,

680
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:50,774
was the invitation to this wedding
that you wanted me to go to.

681
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,279
So here I be.

682
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:58,572
No, no, no. Gale,
this is an old friend of mine.

683
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:01,909
Griffin. Actually,
my ex-boyfriend, Griffin.

684
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,324
Griffin, this is
my ex-boyfriend, Gale.

685
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,001
What's up?

686
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:08,419
Everything.

687
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:11,415
So listen.

688
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:16,257
I know we had some stuff,
but I'm making changes.

689
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:20,136
I sat down with my life coach
and I cleared out everything

690
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,092
except for you.

691
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:25,308
So suddenly I'm more important
than learning the banjo?

692
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:32,276
Griffin, you wanted to ask me
something. Remember?

693
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:35,154
It's very nice meeting you.
That's what people tell me.

694
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:42,157
What was I supposed to do?
Her ex-boyfriend showed up.

695
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,995
Nothing, fleeing was the right call.
Fleeing is the new fighting.

696
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,500
I know we flee,

697
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:50,162
but humans are at
the top of the food chain,

698
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,705
so we should ask Joe.

699
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:54,837
Why are you concerned with
what the stupid lion would do?

700
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:59,171
Do you realize that if monkeys'
canine teeth were a little bigger,

701
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:01,598
we'd hold the title,
King of the Jungle?

702
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:05,135
Let me ask you something,
can the King of the Jungle do this?

703
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:10,644
Uh... He's behind me.
I saw him mid-flip.

704
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,232
Cut her from the herd.

705
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:15,066
Cut her from the herd.
That's a good call, Joe.

706
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:18,653
As long as this other guy's in the
picture, you ain't got a chance.

707
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:21,076
Next time you see her,
get her alone.

708
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:23,324
That's how you'll get your girl.

709

You know what?
It's worth a shot, I'll try it tomorrow.

714
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,796
I basically had
the same advice Joe did,

715
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,964
but he kind of
stole my thunder.

716
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:45,509
- Coming, Barry?
- Okay, you're not listening.

717
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:46,722
I gotta be honest,

718
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:48,728
my legs fell asleep
when we sat down.

719
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:50,389
I think I'm here overnight.

720
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:58,359
Hey. Hey, look, my bus was late.

721
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,023
I need a bike.

722
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,609
Sorry, but that wedding party
just cleaned me out.

723
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:06,287

Whoa, whoa.

00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:37,435
- That's how you're playing it?
- Stay away from her.

732
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:40,947

Oh, Jesus.

755
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,983
Hey.
Oh, Grif.

756
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:06,487
You're like a daredevil.

757
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:11,113
So listen, I've been thinking...

758
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:13,577
I was thinking about...
Hold on a second.

759
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:18,578
Everything just turned light blue.
My body's starting to shut down.

760
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:22,170
Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

761
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:24,459
Okay, I'm good.
Okay.

762
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,294
I was thinking about the wedding.

763
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:29,806
I was wondering if maybe you needed
someone to go with you, that I...

764
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:32,350
Oh, look, Griffin,
I need to tell you something.

765
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,218
Yeah?

766
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:38,102
I'm gonna go to the wedding
with Gale.

767
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:41,143
He was supposed to come with me
before we broke up,

768
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:45,689
and we had this long talk
and I'm really confused right now.

769
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:47,357
I hope you understand.

770
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:54,365
And I hope you understand that
that is fantastic. it's better this way.

771
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:58,285
Really?
Yes, yeah. Yes, yeah.

772
00:42:58,493 --> 00:42:59,540
Okay.
All right.

773
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:01,921
All right. Bye.

774
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:08,507
Get ready to experience
the hail of Gale.

775
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,342
Cherokee style.

776
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,273
You said to out her
from the herd, I did.

777
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:27,564
You see, this is what happens.
I should've never listened to you.

778
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,903
We didn't tell you to back down.

779
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:31,318
Stick to your cozy life

780
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:35,705
because take it from me,
you would never make it in the wild.

781
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:37,664
What did you just say?

782
00:43:37,824 --> 00:43:42,045
In the wild, I would never let a rival
dictate the outcome of a situation.

783
00:43:42,245 --> 00:43:45,465
"In the wild"?
You were born in captivity, Joe.

784
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:48,547
In this very zoo.
I bottle-fed you.

785
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:51,804
"In the wild." You've never been
in the wild a day in your life.

786
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:54,473
I could walk 25 yards
and buy a balloon on a stick.

787
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,384
"Wild."
You're missing the point.

788
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:59,395
Whether you're taking out a rival
or taking down prey,

789
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:02,899
it's not just the attack,
it's about everything leading up to it.

790
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:05,978
The females in the pride,
they do the hunting.

791
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:08,028
We do.
Thank you.

792
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:10,231
And the fighting.
Mm.

793
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:12,862
Okay, you know what?
Are you giving the advice?

794
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:17,493
If you are, I don't need to be here.
Yeah, you heard me, I will walk.

795
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:18,823
Relax, Joe.

796
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:21,163
The best way for a male
to attract a female

797
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,123
is to be seen with another female.

798
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,500
If he's going to the wedding,
he needs a date.

799
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,461
That's it. Good night.

800
00:44:29,292 --> 00:44:30,760
Find a date, sweetie.

801
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:37,221
I'll do that.

802
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:39,268
So basically you're using me.

803
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:40,685
Not basically, I am.

804
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:43,185
This is very junior high,
you do realize that.

805
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,600
It is, I admit it,
I am not proud.

806
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,902
I don't think you should
go through this.

807
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,937
No, I do, I definitely do.
I don't know.

808
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:52,732
You can't remember the last time
you went on a date.

809
00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:57,120
This isn't a real date. If I'm gonna go on a
fake date, I was hoping I'd fake date a doctor.

810
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:59,076
Or somebody French.

811
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,907
Please.

812
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:06,459
If you do this for me, I will give you
half my lunch for the next three years.

813
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:08,460
You know what?

814
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:10,091
And this, to sweeten it.

815
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:13,461
That's a signing bonus, if you do.
Take it, look at that.

816
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:14,716
All right, I'll go.

817
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:19,510
But I'm calling you
Francois Dubois, cardiologist.

818
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,516
You can call me Betty,
as long as you're going.

819
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:32,234
Hey, buddy.

820
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,535
Got a little something for you.

821
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,238
Happy birthday...

822
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:44,952
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

823
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:47,833
It's out. it's out.
I'm sorry.

824
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:51,415
I was just messing with you.

825
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:52,796
Oh, my God.

826
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:55,007
Yeah, I mean,
don't do that to me.

827
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:57,672
It's a gelatin cake.
Kate made it for you.

828
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,804
She's a good lady.
Oh, my heart's racing, man.

829
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:09,851
Was that on a plate?

830
00:46:11,394 --> 00:46:14,898
No, you're good.
Thank Kate for me.

831
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:18,402
That's it?
You're all birthday-ed out?

832
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,738
I'm sure you got things to do.

833
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:25,541
Actually, we do.

834
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:32,461
How are we gonna pull this off?

835
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:36,386
I don't exactly blend in.
It's simple.

836
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:39,338
We just tell people
we're going to a costume party.

837
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:42,266
No one's gonna believe that.
Maybe not at first.

838
00:46:42,425 --> 00:46:47,602
But when you put on this shirt
and talk, they will.

839
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:53,687
Griffin, I'd hug you, but it's
fifty-fifty I'd crush your spine.

840
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:56,773
You know what?
Fist bump works.

841
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,112
Ah! My wrist.
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

842
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:02,196
Payback, baby. Come on.

843

Aw...
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

844

No, you cannot.

Hi, y'all, welcome to Friday's.
Can I interest you in... ?

876
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:50,516
Yeah, we were just
at a costume party. Uh...

877
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:53,939
Zookeeper.
Gorilla.

878
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:55,691
Preppy gorilla.

879
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:59,395
We noticed there was already
a gorilla so we were like:

880
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:04,450
"You know what? Let's put wings on
this loser train, get our Friday's on."

881
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:09,910

882
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:11,661

hasn't been washed in years.

Just hanging out,
enjoying your company.

So there's talk
you might leave the zoo.

Someone can see you.

928
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:17,347
No, no one's around.
We were worried about you.

929
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:20,179
Tell me you're not wearing that
to the wedding.

930
00:52:20,346 --> 00:52:23,350
No, no, I got an outfit.
All set with the other female?

Thanks.

Joe, anything else for Griffin?
What would I know?

934
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:34,281
You're the expert on everything.
God, your mother ruined you.

935
00:52:34,443 --> 00:52:36,821
She did not.

Look. I couldn't help overhearing.

939
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:47,422
You wanna intimidate a rival?
You gotta do this.

940
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:52,587

01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:48,185
She just went with the fall.
The legs were:

1098
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:50,108
Agile.
Yeah, she's bendy.

1099
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:51,810
Don't worry about it. Relax.

1100
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:53,770
All right. Thanks, bro.

1101
01:02:58,358 --> 01:02:59,701
Listen.

1102
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:02,988
I don't know what you're trying
to prove with all your ribbons

1103
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:05,327
and your fancy moves,

1104
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:08,118
but what do you say
you just back the hell off?

1105
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:19,220
And what do you say we drop the
moves and we settle this like men?

1106
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:21,423
Okay.
Huh?

1107
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:24,889
Come on, let's go.
I haven't beaten anybody since my birthday.

1108
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:28,475
Wh... Uh...

1109
01:03:29,681 --> 01:03:30,853
What's up? We gonna do this?

1110
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:36,776
What are you doing?

1111
01:03:38,273 --> 01:03:40,992
What are you doing?
It's attack position.

1112
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:44,036
Man, it's gotta suck to be you.

1113
01:03:44,988 --> 01:03:46,786
Attack.

1114
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:50,076
Griffin's phone. Go for Bernie.

1115
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:52,871
- I split my pants.
- I'm putting you on speaker.

1116
01:03:53,038 --> 01:03:54,130
So how's it going?

1117
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:57,509
What part of "split my pants" don't you get?
My butt's hanging out.

1118
01:03:57,667 --> 01:04:00,762
I took out an ice sculpture,
Gale got in my face, it's a mess.

1119
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:03,511
Griffin, if you wanna
give up, I get you.

1120
01:04:03,715 --> 01:04:05,137
He's not giving up.
Okay.

1121
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:06,768
Don't back down from that guy.

1122
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:09,475
You get in his face,
make him back down.

1123
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:12,228
As far as the girl goes,
you keep her off balance.

1124
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:14,025
You insult her. That's right.

1125
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:16,733
You make her feel bad.
Then you compliment her.

1126
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:18,397
You knock her down,
you bring her up.

1127
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:21,362
When she seems interested,
walk away.

1128
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:22,943
Throw poop at her.

1129
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:26,154
That's how I met Karen.

1130
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:27,785
You can do this.

1131
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:30,333
- Go.
- Close the deal, Griffin.

1132
01:04:30,492 --> 01:04:31,994
Throw the poop.

1133
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:34,962
I'm doing this.

1134
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:43,092
What's up, puppy-breath?
What?

1135
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:46,345
Just saying looking good,
freckle-chest, yeah.

1136
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:48,301
Man, I am hungry.

1137
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:50,183
Ooh. Target sighted.

1138
01:04:58,061 --> 01:04:59,438
Griffin, what's going on?

1139
01:05:02,399 --> 01:05:03,696
Four words:

1140
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:07,908
I need dessert, go.

1141
01:05:10,782 --> 01:05:12,659
God, you're beautiful.

1142
01:05:13,368 --> 01:05:16,463
I am?
Yeah, but you're still here.

1143
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:18,089
Oh, dessert, go...

1144
01:05:18,248 --> 01:05:21,047
Okay, I'm going.

1145
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:24,630
Thanks, boss.

1146
01:05:29,134 --> 01:05:31,762
Whoa, guy, back for more?

1147
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:35,690
Does she talk about me?

1148
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:37,518
Sorry?

1149
01:05:38,226 --> 01:05:41,696
Does she mention me?

1150
01:05:41,855 --> 01:05:44,904
Does the thought of what
Steph and I had haunt you?

1151
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:46,943
You know, keep you up at night?

1152
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:48,953
You mean the way
you flamed down?

1153
01:05:49,154 --> 01:05:52,283
Do we laugh every time we see a
couple riding a horse on a beach?

1154
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:54,167
Oh, yeah.
Not that specifically.

1155
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:56,419
Every time we see
an engagement ring,

1156
01:05:56,578 --> 01:06:03,052
a whiskey bottle with a note in it, a
mariachi band, horse stables or sand.

1157
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:05,303
We laugh until we can't breathe.

1158
01:06:05,837 --> 01:06:07,259
And then we make out

1159
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:09,432
hard.

1160
01:06:10,425 --> 01:06:12,052
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

1161
01:06:12,886 --> 01:06:14,934
Your name's Gale.
What?

1162
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:17,599
You have a woman's name.
No.

1163
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:20,314
No, Gale like Gale Sayers,
the football player.

1164
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:22,650
You wish.
Perfume and teddy bears.

1165
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:25,565
Daddy must have wanted a girl
so he named you Gale.

1166
01:06:25,773 --> 01:06:29,118
Watch it.
Oh, sorry, Gale, you're a female.

1167
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:33,748
Hey, man, you better back off.
Want me to back off, Crystal Gayle?

1168
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:37,919
You got problems, man.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1169
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:41,123
Hey.

1170
01:06:41,331 --> 01:06:43,049
Not in the mood, hammer thumbs.

1171
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:45,836
Griffin, gone.

1172
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:48,926
J' Shake your booty N

1173
01:06:53,301 --> 01:06:55,645
We're leaving.
Okay.

1174
01:06:56,471 --> 01:06:57,688
So tell me everything.

1175
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:01,021
What was with the robot moves?
I don't know, I panicked.

1176
01:07:01,184 --> 01:07:03,812
I also ripped my pants
and cried a little. it's a blur.

1177
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:08,567
That was so fun.

1178
01:07:08,733 --> 01:07:10,656
Can we please do this
every weekend?

1179
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:14,368
Just show up at weddings and trash the place?
Because we are good.

1180
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:18,206
You know, forget good, we're great.
And we're bigger than weddings.

1181
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:19,915
We should rob banks.
I'm in.

1182
01:07:20,078 --> 01:07:23,378
If you say, "Let us knock off
a gas station," I'd do it right now.

1183
01:07:23,581 --> 01:07:27,006
Give me your hand, feel this.
Feel my heartbeat, it's like a rabbit.

1184
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:28,632
All right.
Oh, my God.

1185
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:31,055
Actually, that's not good.

1186
01:07:31,256 --> 01:07:34,009
Yeah, no, I gotta get that checked.
Yeah.

1187
01:07:34,217 --> 01:07:37,938
And Kate, you were incredible.

1188
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:39,889
Thank you.

1189
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:44,899
I'm really glad that you asked me
to come out tonight.

1190
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:48,524
Francois.

1191
01:07:53,528 --> 01:07:54,871
I heard what happened.

1192
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:58,784
I'm so sorry.
Gale can be such an idiot.

1193
01:07:58,950 --> 01:08:01,999
Hey, I know you.

1194
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:05,756
You're that little zoo girl, right?
Kate, yeah.

1195
01:08:06,708 --> 01:08:10,463
Okay, thank you so much
for saving us from that lion.

1196
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:13,973
Oh, my God, I almost passed out.
I was so scared.

1197
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:16,350
Um...

1198
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:20,810
Grif, do you think maybe we
could go somewhere and talk?

1199
01:08:22,015 --> 01:08:25,269
Can we just have a sec?
Sure.

1200
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:34,277
It worked. Can you believe it?

1201
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:37,451
Yeah.

1202
01:08:37,614 --> 01:08:40,083
That's... That's amazing.

1203
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:43,913
That's what we came here for, right?
It is, I...

1204
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,622
You need to do this.
Yeah?

1205
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:48,382
Yes, yes.
You helped so much, thank you.

1206
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:51,636
No, I'm just gonna take a taxi,
or a shuttle or something.

1207
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:53,637
Go, go.
Are you sure?

1208
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:56,345
I can't believe it, thank you.

1209
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:59,344
Hey, Stephanie.

1210
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:03,355
Hey.
Hi.

1211
01:09:03,514 --> 01:09:05,812
Yay.

1212
01:09:06,601 --> 01:09:08,649
Okay, let's review your order.

1213
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:12,532
That'll be 64 meat lover's pizzas,
32 Caesar salads.

1214
01:09:12,732 --> 01:09:16,032
And can I interest you
in our new fudge roll?

1215
01:09:17,904 --> 01:09:19,497
Yes.

1216
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:24,628
All right, let's see,
that's a total of $1636. 74.

1217
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:26,170
Will that be cash or credit?

1218
01:09:27,705 --> 01:09:29,048
Hang it up, hang it up.

1219
01:09:29,248 --> 01:09:30,716
So close.

1220
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:32,840
I am so happy right now.

1221
01:09:33,044 --> 01:09:35,547
You know that, ever feel that?
All the time, like...

1222
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:37,761
You happy now?
Because right now I'm happy.

1223
01:09:37,924 --> 01:09:41,895
And it's, like, all of a sudden it just
hits you, like, bam, I'm happy now.

1224
01:09:42,053 --> 01:09:45,353
Gosh, you know, I have a fashion
show tomorrow, I want you to come.

1225
01:09:46,557 --> 01:09:49,310
Tomorrow, I'm supposed to work.

1226
01:09:50,978 --> 01:09:53,231
Sad face.

1227
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:55,567
How about instead...
What?

1228
01:09:55,733 --> 01:09:58,532
You come to the zoo.
I give you a private tour.

1229
01:09:58,736 --> 01:10:01,535
That's a terrible idea.

1230
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:04,788
I really thought
you were different.

1231
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:07,708
But the same old zoo stuff.

1232
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:13,301
You know what?
Let someone else zoo-keep tomorrow.

1233
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:17,213
Really?
Yeah.

1234
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:20,058
I don't remember this Griffin.

1235
01:10:20,258 --> 01:10:24,058
Yeah, well, you get used to it
because now it's all about you.

1236
01:10:24,262 --> 01:10:27,391
Okay.
You know what else?

1237
01:10:27,598 --> 01:10:30,602
You got a bat in the cave.
Yeah, she got a booger.

1238
01:10:30,768 --> 01:10:32,270
No, don't say that.
Gross.

1239
01:10:32,437 --> 01:10:34,565
No, other side, nostril.
Take care of that.

1240
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:36,904
I'm going to the bathroom.
You better.

1241
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:39,068
Don't go anywhere.
Not going anywhere.

1242
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:42,489
Throw out the napkin.
Okay, I'm so sorry.

1243
01:10:42,697 --> 01:10:44,370
Dead empty when
you get back, woman.

1244
01:10:44,532 --> 01:10:46,079
Okay.

1245
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:50,751
♪ In the car crash ♪

1246
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:54,546

1247
01:10:54,709 --> 01:10:57,553
Jurgen. Jurgen.

1248
01:10:57,712 --> 01:10:59,840
Stephanie.
Hi.

1249
01:11:00,047 --> 01:11:01,765
Kiss, kiss.

1250
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:04,807
This is Jurgen Milraux.

1251
01:11:06,429 --> 01:11:08,682
Who is this chaotic pile of man?

1252
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:13,771
He's ruining the vibes here.
He is a waste of space.

1253
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:15,605
I'm sorry, what?

1254
01:11:15,813 --> 01:11:20,410
You scream, "Help me,
I'm worthless and funny-looking."

1255
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:24,910
Can I, uh...?

1256
01:11:25,072 --> 01:11:27,416
Can I ask you a question?
Yes.

1257
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:30,503
Hey, Siegfried, where's Roy?
What?

1258
01:11:32,455 --> 01:11:34,833
How's the chocolate factory,
Willy Wonka?

1259
01:11:36,459 --> 01:11:39,383
I'm sorry, but you walked
right into that one, grandma hair.

1260
01:11:39,587 --> 01:11:40,679
Grandma hair?

1261
01:11:40,838 --> 01:11:44,263
He got the grandma hair,
he got the grandma hair.

1262
01:11:44,425 --> 01:11:46,018
I don't understand one word.

1263
01:11:46,177 --> 01:11:51,354
Here's what you have to
understand, your face is a poem.

1264
01:11:54,227 --> 01:11:55,979
I feel

1265
01:11:57,522 --> 01:11:58,774
pleasure.

1266
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:05,288
Whoa, let's put the donkey
back in the barn.

1267
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:10,159
Gonna mingle.

1268
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:22,635
You were awesome in there.
Oh, my God, my friends love you.

1269
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:28,016
You were so great. I gotta say,
you are really getting there.

1270
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:29,766
Hm?

1271
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:35,231
Look, I hope you don't mind,
but I talked to your brother

1272
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:38,062
and you have a job at the dealership
if you want it.

1273
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:42,241
Is that pushy? Hey, you Know what?
Fine, I'm pushy.

1274
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,777
It's just...

1275
01:12:43,943 --> 01:12:48,494
I think that that zoo is
really holding you back.

1276
01:12:49,574 --> 01:12:51,793
You deserve better.

1277
01:12:55,913 --> 01:12:57,460
We deserve better.

1278
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:00,926
We?

1279
01:13:17,184 --> 01:13:20,859
Good call, Glenn.
An animal like you on this bad boy?

1280
01:13:21,022 --> 01:13:23,571
It's top of the food chain.
Follow.

1281
01:13:27,445 --> 01:13:30,119
Shana, wanna grab us
an espresso and a Montblanc?

1282
01:13:30,281 --> 01:13:32,704
- We're having a signing party.
- Yes, sir.

1283
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:34,706
Enjoy the hunt.

1284
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:37,539
Huh?
Ha-ha-huh.

1285
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:41,918
Dancing.

1286
01:13:59,602 --> 01:14:01,479
Back off, Nimer.
You back off.

1287
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:05,741
Oh, not cool.
Yeah.

1288
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:08,031
What's up?

1289
01:14:09,070 --> 01:14:11,118
- Welcome to the dream.
- Help!

1290
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,955
I don't like this thing!
Make it stop, make it stop!

1291
01:14:28,756 --> 01:14:31,680
That looks difficult.
You know what's not difficult?

1292
01:14:31,842 --> 01:14:33,515
Giving a supermodel the bad news

1293
01:14:33,678 --> 01:14:37,103
that I can't date you because I'm already
dating a supermodel. Ha, ha, ha.

1294
01:14:38,933 --> 01:14:41,903
Whoa! Mm.

1295
01:14:42,853 --> 01:14:43,945
Yeah.

1296
01:14:48,275 --> 01:14:49,868
Wow.

1297
01:14:50,027 --> 01:14:52,951
I gotta say, this is incredible.
Where have you been?

1298
01:14:53,531 --> 01:14:56,410
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about, I...

1299
01:14:56,575 --> 01:14:57,792
It's time.

1300
01:14:58,577 --> 01:15:00,955
Oh, God, he's calling,
letting her know he's here.

1301
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:03,916
Watch this, look, look, look.

1302
01:15:06,293 --> 01:15:07,419
Aren't they amazing?

1303
01:15:07,586 --> 01:15:11,557
Yeah, no, they're great.
They're fast and sincere.

1304
01:15:11,716 --> 01:15:15,562
Did you know they mate for life?
I do now.

1305
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:18,890
Listen, Kate, I wanted you
to be the first to know

1306
01:15:19,056 --> 01:15:22,606
that I took a job working for
my brother at his dealership.

1307
01:15:25,396 --> 01:15:29,367
Shut up.
I'm serious, I figured I'd...

1308
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:33,280
I'd done everything I set out to
do in the zoo game and it was...

1309
01:15:33,446 --> 01:15:37,041
The zoo game? What the hell
are you talking about, Griffin?

1310
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:40,294
You love working here, you're great at it.
The animals love you.

1311
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:45,425
Yeah, but maybe that's not enough.
it's time I start thinking about myself.

1312
01:15:45,624 --> 01:15:48,127
Okay, is this coming
from you or Stephanie?

1313
01:15:48,294 --> 01:15:52,595
No, it's my decision... I mean, she
thinks it's a good idea, but I do too.

1314
01:15:52,757 --> 01:15:54,225
Wow.

1315
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:56,602
Not buying it.
You can't see what's happening?

1316
01:15:56,761 --> 01:15:58,308
Yeah, I am changing me.

1317
01:15:58,512 --> 01:16:01,812
No, she's changing you
into something that you're not.

1318
01:16:02,016 --> 01:16:04,314
Well, maybe what I was before
wasn't what I was.

1319
01:16:04,477 --> 01:16:08,903
And it is now, maybe, that it is
if it is the way it is.

1320
01:16:09,106 --> 01:16:12,280
You're not making any sense.
Makes enough sense that you get it.

1321
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:15,659
Okay, look,

1322
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:19,667
if you wanna quit,
I'm not gonna stand in your way.

1323
01:16:20,743 --> 01:16:24,998
But I want you to look me in the eye and
tell me this is what you really want.

1324
01:16:31,879 --> 01:16:33,847
It is.

1325
01:16:36,383 --> 01:16:38,101
There you have it.

1326
01:17:03,661 --> 01:17:05,663
Hey, Bern,

1327
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:08,795
got your favorite.

1328
01:17:13,754 --> 01:17:16,803
- Hey, listen, I just wanted to...
- Save it.

1329
01:17:17,007 --> 01:17:18,429
I already heard.

1330
01:17:19,593 --> 01:17:23,894
You know, you almost had me
convinced things could be different.

1331
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:27,276
That I could actually trust
someone again.

1332
01:17:28,686 --> 01:17:31,360
You can.

1333
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:37,361
Oh, I gotta take this. One sec.

1334
01:17:37,528 --> 01:17:39,201
Yo, go for Grif.

1335
01:17:39,363 --> 01:17:42,537
No, Mohegan blue. Mm-hm.
Chrome Wheel Package, buddy.

1336
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:46,955
Papers are all ready for you,
make it happen, slam it.

1337
01:17:47,121 --> 01:17:48,373
All right, gotta go.

1338
01:17:48,539 --> 01:17:49,756
Oh, sorry, Bern.

1339
01:17:49,957 --> 01:17:55,009
All people lie,
and I was an idiot to believe you.

1340
01:18:19,111 --> 01:18:20,863
Hey, Shane.

1341
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:24,408
I'm gonna let you in
on a little something.

1342
01:18:24,575 --> 01:18:27,249
Ten years ago, you and
Bernie had an incident.

1343
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:31,333
I know what you did.
I also know you lied about it.

1344
01:18:34,043 --> 01:18:35,090
So?

1345
01:18:35,252 --> 01:18:39,302
So if you ever do
anything like that again,

1346
01:18:39,465 --> 01:18:44,562
I will go to your house and I will
beat you in front of your mother.

1347
01:18:54,188 --> 01:18:58,694
Yeah, I'm telling you, Vern, this baby
does zero to 60 in under four seconds.

1348
01:18:58,901 --> 01:19:00,995
Yeah, I don't know, I...

1349
01:19:01,153 --> 01:19:03,656
I got grandkids.
That's even better.

1350
01:19:03,864 --> 01:19:07,209
You stick them back here.
You tell them it's a secret cave.

1351
01:19:25,844 --> 01:19:27,721
I can't take it.
I miss Griffin.

1352
01:19:29,098 --> 01:19:31,271
I know you can't see it
but my lip won't stop quivering.

1353
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:34,607
He wouldn't be gone if you'd listened.
You talked to him first.

1354
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:36,443
Yeah, he's right, you know?

1355
01:19:36,605 --> 01:19:37,822
I can't take it.

1356
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:41,493
You're killing us with the crying.
You were sobbing all night.

1357
01:19:41,652 --> 01:19:44,451
I wasn't, I have sleep apnea.
Sounded like baby-crying.

1358
01:19:44,655 --> 01:19:46,828
Baby-crying.
What did you say, thumbs?

1359
01:19:46,991 --> 01:19:50,837
Come down and say it to my face.
I leave this tree, I'm slapping you silly.

1360
01:19:50,995 --> 01:19:53,123
You come down
and I'll use you as a loofah.

1361
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:55,298
How? You have no thumbs.

1362
01:19:55,499 --> 01:19:58,173
Oh, yeah? Let's do this.
I'll start from my back. Bring it.

1363
01:19:58,377 --> 01:20:00,175
That's it, I'm quitting my diet.

1364
01:20:00,337 --> 01:20:02,010
Can't quit something
you never started.

1365
01:20:02,214 --> 01:20:05,514
- You know what I think we should do?
- Not a zoo animal!

1366
01:20:09,513 --> 01:20:11,015
Hey, Kate.

1367
01:20:11,181 --> 01:20:14,776
Hey, Venom.
Oh, what are they doing out?

1368
01:20:14,935 --> 01:20:16,903
Grieving. They miss Griffin.

1369
01:20:17,104 --> 01:20:20,483
Oh, I know how they feel.
Yeah.

1370
01:20:22,067 --> 01:20:26,789
Look, Venom, I'm sorry,
but I'm leaving the zoo tomorrow.

1371
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:30,918
You too?
Yeah.

1372
01:20:31,118 --> 01:20:36,921
The eagle enclosure is up and running
so I'm taking a job in Nairobi.

1373
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:38,876
Why?

1374
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:43,306
I was gonna pass because I started
having feelings for someone here,

1375
01:20:43,464 --> 01:20:47,810
but he's with somebody else, so...

1376
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:50,312
You know?

1377
01:20:50,888 --> 01:20:52,890
I do.

1378
01:20:58,312 --> 01:20:59,359
What are you doing?

1379
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:02,821
Oh, what are you doing?
Don't you play possum.

1380
01:21:03,025 --> 01:21:04,447
What?
You know?

1381
01:21:04,651 --> 01:21:06,528
You started having feelings.

1382
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:09,949
Come on, "someone here."

1383
01:21:11,033 --> 01:21:13,331
I was talking about Griffin.

1384
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:16,379
Tragic misread of situation.

1385
01:21:20,918 --> 01:21:24,639
Feel as though
you're breathing through your eyes.

1386
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:27,846
Hey, babe, how was your day?
Did you sell a lot of cars?

1387
01:21:28,008 --> 01:21:32,058
Three, but you know what?
One guy, he didn't feel like he needed it.

1388
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:33,723
Yay.

1389
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:37,234
Do you love it?
Trying to complete the pose...

1390
01:21:37,393 --> 01:21:40,192
Is that a chair?
Yes, it's a Chintoko.

1391
01:21:40,354 --> 01:21:43,654
Really?
There's only five in the entire world.

1392
01:21:43,857 --> 01:21:45,234
Sit, sit, sit.

1393
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:48,362
Yeah, okay. Yay! I love it.

1394
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:50,914
Isn't it comfy, cozy?
Yeah.

1395
01:21:51,073 --> 01:21:55,123
Totally amazing. I just think
this whole place looks so great.

1396
01:21:55,327 --> 01:21:58,297
It's really just...
It's coming together.

1397
01:21:58,497 --> 01:21:59,919
I'm so happy.

1398
01:22:00,124 --> 01:22:03,799
Really gives this whole room a nice zhuzh.
You know what I mean?

1399
01:22:04,002 --> 01:22:07,597
Hey, you know what?
I ordered in dinner tonight from Le Chereaux.

1400
01:22:07,798 --> 01:22:09,050
Oh, you know what else?

1401
01:22:09,216 --> 01:22:14,017
That just reminds me, we have an
absinthe tasting on Mathieu's sailboat.

1402
01:22:14,221 --> 01:22:16,223
Yeah, Mathieu.
Do you remember him?

1403
01:22:16,390 --> 01:22:18,643
He's disgustingly rich.
Yum.

1404
01:22:20,269 --> 01:22:24,866
Okay, I gotta get my yoga. Hey, you think it's bad
feng shui that we have a TV in the living room?

1405
01:22:25,023 --> 01:22:26,491
I feel if I do yoga in here,

1406
01:22:26,650 --> 01:22:29,870
it will counterbalance
the whole bad juju, you know?

1407
01:22:30,028 --> 01:22:31,780
Bad juju of the TV.

1408
01:22:32,614 --> 01:22:36,790
Wait till I show you
this new dress I bought.

1409
01:22:53,427 --> 01:22:54,679
What's wrong?

1410
01:22:57,639 --> 01:22:59,641
Hoping for someone else?

1411
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:04,529
Hungry?

1412
01:23:13,822 --> 01:23:15,290
Guys, see that lady there?

1413
01:23:15,491 --> 01:23:18,791
I just sold her an extended
warranty we don't even have.

1414
01:23:18,952 --> 01:23:20,875
Nice, guy, nice.

1415
01:23:21,038 --> 01:23:24,258
We've got a high roller checking
out the Mercedes McLaren.

1416
01:23:33,884 --> 01:23:36,262
Knock yourself out, Nimer.

1417
01:23:37,304 --> 01:23:39,853
Oh, you got a good eye.

1418
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:44,987
Griffin Constantine Keyes.
Mm.

1419
01:23:45,145 --> 01:23:46,863
The changes I've seen in you

1420
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:51,118
these past few weeks have been
nothing short of remarkable.

1421
01:23:52,528 --> 01:23:54,326
And I've been doing
a little soul-searching.

1422
01:23:54,488 --> 01:23:58,413
And I made a mistake five years ago
on that beach.

1423
01:23:58,617 --> 01:24:01,245
And I wanna correct it.

1424
01:24:01,411 --> 01:24:03,630
So will you... ?
Yeah, not gonna happen.

1425
01:24:07,334 --> 01:24:09,302
What?
Heh.

1426
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:11,429
Come on,
you had to see this coming.

1427
01:24:11,588 --> 01:24:13,511
Look, when we first started dating,

1428
01:24:13,674 --> 01:24:17,724
you assumed I was gonna turn into the
type of guy you always dreamed about.

1429
01:24:17,886 --> 01:24:19,729
But you know what?

1430
01:24:19,888 --> 01:24:21,856
I don't like that guy.

1431
01:24:22,015 --> 01:24:24,814
I don't like this job.
I don't, bro, I'm sorry.

1432
01:24:25,018 --> 01:24:28,272
It's not... Yeah, this I love.
But we'll always have this, you know?

1433
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:30,107
I love you, right? Okay, good.

1434
01:24:30,315 --> 01:24:33,068
I don't like this suit.
I don't like our Chintaki chairs.

1435
01:24:33,277 --> 01:24:35,075
Chintoko.
Either, I don't like them.

1436
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:39,250
I don't like that I can't understand
90 percent of the stuff you talk about.

1437
01:24:39,825 --> 01:24:44,797
But most of all,
I hate who I've become.

1438
01:24:53,672 --> 01:24:55,424
I'll ignore them.

1439
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:02,435
Shut up.

1440
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:05,977
Shut up, he didn't say yes.
I'm not gonna pay you.

1441
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:20,498
Come back for your watch?

1442
01:25:20,657 --> 01:25:25,288
No, I came back to see if you
were interested in happy hour at Friday's.

1443
01:25:25,495 --> 01:25:28,499
Look, if you're here just
to yank my chain...

1444
01:25:28,665 --> 01:25:31,339
I'm not. I wanna tell you I'm sorry.

1445
01:25:31,543 --> 01:25:33,841
And I know I let you down.

1446
01:25:34,046 --> 01:25:37,516
And that you...
You're my best friend.

1447
01:25:43,722 --> 01:25:47,192
And, oh, yeah, I, uh...
I dumped Stephanie.

1448
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:51,238
Nicely done.
Yeah.

1449
01:25:51,396 --> 01:25:55,993
Hey, what happened to your eye?
It's good to have you back, Grif.

1450
01:25:57,277 --> 01:25:58,904
Hey, Griffin, you're back.

1451
01:25:59,112 --> 01:26:00,785
Oh, everyone's gonna be so happy.

1452
01:26:00,947 --> 01:26:02,870
Right now I gotta go talk
to Kate, okay?

1453
01:26:03,033 --> 01:26:04,626
Griffin, Kate's gone.

1454
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:07,579
She's leaving for Africa tonight.
What?

1455
01:26:07,746 --> 01:26:10,044
She's on a 9:15 flight.

1456
01:26:10,248 --> 01:26:13,127
Oh, man, it's my fault.

1457
01:26:13,293 --> 01:26:15,341
I blew it.
It's my fault.

1458
01:26:15,545 --> 01:26:19,675
I told you to be someone you're not.
No, you know what? it's my fault.

1459
01:26:19,883 --> 01:26:23,012
I was worried you were gonna leave,
I wasn't thinking about you.

1460
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:26,144
It's not my fault.
I said throw poop at her, always works.

1461
01:26:26,306 --> 01:26:29,685
Who cares whose fault it is?

1462
01:26:29,851 --> 01:26:32,604
There's still time. Let's get Kate.

1463
01:26:34,398 --> 01:26:38,244
Follow me, everyone.
Nothing can stand in our way.

1464
01:26:39,778 --> 01:26:42,156
Wow, he is really hauling.

1465
01:26:42,322 --> 01:26:43,869
Oh, he stopped.

1466
01:26:44,032 --> 01:26:47,411
He's eating a pretzel.
Barry is right, I'm going to get her.

1467
01:26:47,619 --> 01:26:50,873
Wait, it's bumper to bumper
to the airport. Whoa, almost took off.

1468
01:26:51,081 --> 01:26:53,960
My gosh, you're right.
It's rush hour, I'll never make it.

1469
01:26:54,167 --> 01:26:56,795
I can get you there.
I'm the fastest animal in the zoo.

1470
01:26:56,962 --> 01:26:59,010
Plus, I fit in the bike lane. Hop on.

1471
01:27:01,258 --> 01:27:02,760
Hop off, hop off.

1472
01:27:05,887 --> 01:27:08,481
New plan. Follow me.

1473
01:27:10,142 --> 01:27:11,689
Griffin, I got your back, baby.

1474
01:27:16,064 --> 01:27:17,316
Wait, where you going?

1475
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:21,157
Hey, Griffin, you nut.
What are you doing back there?

1476
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:23,493
Nothing, everything is fine.

1477
01:27:23,655 --> 01:27:25,532
Can't be in that
area, it's unauthorized.

1478
01:27:25,741 --> 01:27:28,039
A guy inside said it's okay.
They will allow it.

1479
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:30,587
Listen, having a party Saturday,
a blowout.

1480
01:27:30,746 --> 01:27:32,919
Sounds good, I'm there.
I love blowouts. Whoo!

1481
01:27:33,123 --> 01:27:35,000
It's gonna be wild.
I'll see you.

1482
01:27:35,208 --> 01:27:37,256
Where you going, Griffin?
Hey, get out.

1483
01:27:37,461 --> 01:27:40,089
- I can do this.
- Wait, don't leave.

1484
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:41,381
Okay.

1485
01:27:41,548 --> 01:27:43,642
Can't you hear what I'm saying?

1486
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:45,222
Hey, Griffin! I'm saying...

1487
01:28:09,534 --> 01:28:10,831
Hey.

1488
01:28:21,838 --> 01:28:23,840
Hang on a second.

1489
01:28:24,049 --> 01:28:26,097
Where are you going?
Can't leave me here.

1490
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:28,929
I'm out of the zoo without my Izod.

1491
01:28:30,472 --> 01:28:32,019
Griffin, what a surprise.

1492
01:28:32,182 --> 01:28:33,684

1499
01:29:02,838 --> 01:29:05,887
Come on, the road's blocked.
Yeah, oh...

1500
01:29:06,091 --> 01:29:08,685
How about this?
I'll go around the back.

1501
01:29:22,607 --> 01:29:24,109
Come on.

1502
01:29:24,276 --> 01:29:26,153
What do we do?

1503
01:29:31,074 --> 01:29:32,371
Oh, you...

1504
01:29:32,534 --> 01:29:34,707
You know what?
A heads up would be nice.

1505
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:36,918
Go, I'll meet you there.

1506
01:29:45,338 --> 01:29:48,387
Kate!

1507
01:29:50,969 --> 01:29:52,937
Wait, stop!

1508
01:29:53,096 --> 01:29:55,599
Kate!

1509
01:29:55,807 --> 01:29:58,401
Oh, God, she's gone.

1510
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,813
It's over.
It's not over.

1511
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:09,367
Get in.

1512
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:17,254
Stay in sync.
I'm trying.

1513
01:30:17,454 --> 01:30:19,502
Your arms are twice
as long as mine.

1514
01:30:19,706 --> 01:30:23,677
Hurry, we gotta cut her off
at the bridge or she's gone.

1515
01:30:24,210 --> 01:30:26,008
Row, gorilla, row.

1516
01:30:26,171 --> 01:30:29,801
Come on, use those big arms, baby.
Now we're doing it.

1517
01:30:29,966 --> 01:30:32,685
Row, row, row.

1518
01:30:40,185 --> 01:30:41,812
Bernie.

1519
01:30:46,316 --> 01:30:48,819
I was kind of hoping
we'd see some steps.

1520
01:30:48,985 --> 01:30:50,737
Get on.
What?

1521
01:30:50,904 --> 01:30:53,248
Get on my back.
Okay.

1522
01:31:01,915 --> 01:31:03,508
You know what?

1523
01:31:03,667 --> 01:31:06,420
I don't think I can do this.
I'm afraid of heights.

1524
01:31:06,586 --> 01:31:08,133
Oh, no.
Don't look down.

1525
01:31:10,173 --> 01:31:12,471
That's not helping.
Don't look up.

1526
01:31:12,676 --> 01:31:17,022
Aah! Bernie, I'm looking down.
This is not good, give me your hand.

1527
01:31:38,493 --> 01:31:39,540
There she is.

1528
01:31:46,584 --> 01:31:48,882
Hurry, she's on the move.

1529
01:31:50,755 --> 01:31:52,348
What are you stopping for?

1530
01:31:52,507 --> 01:31:56,432
Just be yourself, Griffin.
That's all you need to do.

1531
01:31:56,594 --> 01:31:59,848
Now go get your girl.
How?

1532
01:32:07,313 --> 01:32:08,906
Griffin?
Kate, hey.

1533
01:32:09,065 --> 01:32:11,443
Oh, my God, are you okay?
Yeah.

1534
01:32:11,609 --> 01:32:14,203
What the hell are you doing?
I was cartwheeling.

1535
01:32:14,362 --> 01:32:15,830
What?
I...

1536
01:32:15,989 --> 01:32:17,036
Oh, you said...

1537
01:32:17,198 --> 01:32:19,951
You said eagles, they mate for life.
Yes.

1538
01:32:20,118 --> 01:32:23,839
Well, when an eagle finds its perfect
mate, they cartwheel, right?

1539
01:32:23,997 --> 01:32:28,844
That's what they do. They lock their
talons together and spin out of control.

1540
01:32:29,044 --> 01:32:32,844
And just before they hit the ground,
they break apart.

1541
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:36,810
The only difference
between me and an eagle is

1542
01:32:37,010 --> 01:32:39,308
I will hit the ground
as you've just seen.

1543
01:32:41,931 --> 01:32:45,606
You said you were done
with the zoo game.

1544
01:32:45,810 --> 01:32:48,939
I thought I had to change
who I was to be happy,

1545
01:32:49,105 --> 01:32:50,482
but I was wrong.

1546
01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:56,663
Kate, it took me five years to get over
someone I wasn't even in love with.

1547
01:32:56,821 --> 01:33:00,166
I can't imagine how long
it would take to get over you.

1548
01:33:01,534 --> 01:33:05,710
And on a side note, I may have
crushed an ostrich getting here.

1549
01:33:07,207 --> 01:33:09,926
I don't wanna know.
I don't wanna know.

1550
01:33:26,184 --> 01:33:27,902
He's fine, he's...
No, no.

1551
01:33:28,061 --> 01:33:30,063
Yeah, we should get him back,
we should.
