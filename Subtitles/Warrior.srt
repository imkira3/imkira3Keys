1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:01:04,641 --> 00:01:08,518
Hey, Jenny. That was a
wonderful share, tonight.

3
00:01:20,323 --> 00:01:23,742
"Chapter 36, The Quarter-Deck."

4
00:01:23,826 --> 00:01:26,495
"Enter Ahab. Then, all."

5
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,998
"It was not a great while after
the affair of the pipe,"

6
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:33,752
"that one morning, shortly after
breakfast, Ahab, as was his wont,"

7
00:01:33,836 --> 00:01:36,546
"ascended the cabin-gangway
to the deck."

8
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:59,319
"'It's a white whale, I say, ' resumed
Ahab, as he threw down the top-maul.

9
00:01:59,404 --> 00:02:03,407
"'A white whale. Skin
your eyes for him, men,

10
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:07,035
"'look sharp for white water, if
ye see but a bubble, sing out."'

11
00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:34,813
Tommy?

12
00:02:37,025 --> 00:02:38,191
Jesus!

13
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,575
What are you doing here?

14
00:02:47,118 --> 00:02:48,994
Well, I was just passing through

15
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:52,914
and I figured why not have
a belt with the old man.

16
00:02:53,499 --> 00:02:54,750
Yeah.

17
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,588
She looks good.

18
00:03:00,339 --> 00:03:03,550
Yeah, she's hanging in there.

19
00:03:04,886 --> 00:03:07,596
Well, you always did
take good care of her.

20
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:10,557
Paddy Conlon.

21
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:14,269
Man of priorities.

22
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,780
I got a little
something for you.

23
00:03:25,156 --> 00:03:27,949
Mom always said, "Never go
anywhere empty-handed."

24
00:03:28,034 --> 00:03:29,284
She did.

25
00:03:30,703 --> 00:03:33,121
That's not for me
anymore, Tommy.

26
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,835
What? You changed brands?

27
00:03:42,048 --> 00:03:44,216
Let's go inside, huh?

28
00:03:45,468 --> 00:03:46,802
Tommy!

29
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,472
Come on, let's go inside.

30
00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:15,330
I like what you've
done with the place.

31
00:04:15,414 --> 00:04:17,874
Yeah, I appreciate that.

32
00:04:19,502 --> 00:04:22,003
There's not much of a
woman's touch around here.

33
00:04:23,214 --> 00:04:24,840
Yeah, well...

34
00:04:26,134 --> 00:04:28,593
And no more women for me, Tommy.

35
00:04:29,846 --> 00:04:31,304
Yeah.

36
00:04:31,764 --> 00:04:35,600
It must be hard to find a girl
who can take a punch nowadays.

37
00:04:42,024 --> 00:04:43,775
Here you go.

38
00:04:45,862 --> 00:04:47,445
Coffee?

39
00:04:49,615 --> 00:04:52,367
You haven't seen a guy in 14 years and
you're not gonna have a drink with him?

40
00:04:52,451 --> 00:04:54,578
- Come on.
- I told you, I'm off it, Tommy.

41
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:56,538
I'm coming up on 1,000 days.

42
00:04:59,876 --> 00:05:03,545
- Come on, it's just a drink.
- No.

43
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,159
He's a school teacher
down in Philly.

44
00:05:35,453 --> 00:05:37,412
Remember Tess?

45
00:05:37,496 --> 00:05:40,207
They had two beautiful
little girls.

46
00:06:06,525 --> 00:06:09,694
So, you found God, huh?
That's awesome.

47
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:13,531
I think Mom kept calling out
for him, but he wasn't around.

48
00:06:16,285 --> 00:06:19,996
I guess Jesus was down at the mill
forgiving all the drunks, huh?

49
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,416
Who knew?

50
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:32,050
So, you gonna ask about her,

51
00:06:32,134 --> 00:06:34,970
or you just gonna sit
there all sober?

52
00:06:36,472 --> 00:06:39,683
- I know.
- You know? What do you know? Huh?

53
00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:42,978
Do you know it wasn't enough to
drive west to get away from you,

54
00:06:43,062 --> 00:06:45,772
that once we hit the water,
we drove north, too?

55
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:49,567
When I got sober, I hired
a man to find you.

56
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:52,946
And is that one of the 12 steps?

57
00:06:53,489 --> 00:06:56,199
Or does a guy like you get 24?

58
00:06:58,744 --> 00:07:00,495
Just 12.

59
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:08,586
Did your guy tell you
what you needed to know?

60
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,340
Just that your mother
died in Tacoma.

61
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:15,552
But you were in the Marines.

62
00:07:16,178 --> 00:07:17,804
That was all.

63
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,557
That was enough.

64
00:07:24,061 --> 00:07:26,062
Well, that's too bad,

65
00:07:27,106 --> 00:07:30,358
'cause you could've
gotten some good details.

66
00:07:32,028 --> 00:07:35,405
You could've heard about her
coughing up blood on her knees

67
00:07:36,073 --> 00:07:38,366
in a shit box with no heat.

68
00:07:39,702 --> 00:07:45,081
Having me rub her down with holy water,
because, well, she didn't have no insurance.

69
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:50,837
All the time waiting for your
pal, Jesus, to save her.

70
00:07:52,548 --> 00:07:54,632
Did your man tell you that?

71
00:07:58,304 --> 00:08:00,305
I'm sorry, Tommy.

72
00:08:08,105 --> 00:08:10,565
Well, it's good to know
that you're sorry, Pop.

73
00:08:12,568 --> 00:08:14,694
It goes a long way.

74
00:08:20,826 --> 00:08:24,162
I think I liked you better
when you were a drunk.

75
00:08:38,093 --> 00:08:40,345
All right, then. All right,
all right, all right.

76
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:42,055
You say I can, but
you say I can't.

77
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,350
- What about if we all get a unicorn?
- No.

78
00:08:45,434 --> 00:08:46,976
- Don't you want a unicorn?
- No.

79
00:08:50,815 --> 00:08:52,607
What's going on up here?

80
00:08:52,691 --> 00:08:54,359
- Oh, my goodness.
- Well, I'm not sure,

81
00:08:54,443 --> 00:08:58,071
but I think Daddy
is now a princess.

82
00:08:58,155 --> 00:09:00,949
- Daddy, you look so handsome.
- Do I?

83
00:09:01,033 --> 00:09:02,784
- He's a very pretty princess.
- We're painting Daddy's face.

84
00:09:03,452 --> 00:09:04,953
Yeah, you are.

85
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:10,959
Okay. Yeah. Em, you wanna
open your presents?

86
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:15,213
- Yeah? You wanna do present time? Okay.
- Yeah. All right, come on. Ready?

87
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:17,882
- All right! It's time for presents!
- I have to put this down.

88
00:09:17,967 --> 00:09:19,926
- Here. You wanna put it down?
- Presents time!

89
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,928
- Everybody, come bring your presents!
- What is it? What is it?

90
00:09:22,263 --> 00:09:25,807
Let's start with this one.
How about that, Emily?

91
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,142
- All right.
- Happy birthday, Emily.

92
00:09:28,352 --> 00:09:30,854
- What did you get? What did you get?
- Babe?

93
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,648
It's an awfully big box.

94
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:35,525
It's her birthday. Come on.

95
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:37,360
I know, babe, but that's
why you call it a budget.

96
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:40,029
You set it and you don't budge.

97
00:09:40,114 --> 00:09:42,031
- This one's mine.
- Hey, open the big box!

98
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:43,575
It's okay.

99
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:49,205
- I love you. Be good, okay?
- Bye, Mommy.

100
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,541
Daddy's gonna give you a bath.

101
00:09:52,668 --> 00:09:55,044
- Hey, babe. I'm late.
- Hey.

102
00:09:55,129 --> 00:09:57,547
Mom's saying goodbye to the girls,
she's got to get on the road.

103
00:09:57,631 --> 00:10:01,009
- They've been fed, they just need a bath.
- I'm on it.

104
00:10:01,135 --> 00:10:03,428
Okay, can you get them to bed
at a reasonable time tonight?

105
00:10:03,512 --> 00:10:04,762
Because, after the party,
they're just exhausted.

106
00:10:04,847 --> 00:10:07,140
Where's the rest of that skirt?

107
00:10:07,308 --> 00:10:08,558
Babe.

108
00:10:08,934 --> 00:10:10,935
Listen, if any guys give you a
hassle in that joint tonight,

109
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,395
you give me a call, okay?

110
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:14,355
Yeah, just like you gave me a
call when those Temple frat boys

111
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,190
decided to smash up your face.

112
00:10:16,275 --> 00:10:18,443
I told you, most nights, I sit
on the stool and grade papers,

113
00:10:18,527 --> 00:10:21,613
but, every now and then,
I need some action.

114
00:10:22,031 --> 00:10:26,618
All right. Well, wait up for me tonight.
I'll see what I can do about that.

115
00:10:26,994 --> 00:10:28,369
Promises, promises.

116
00:10:35,377 --> 00:10:36,920
And we return here on MMA Live,

117
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:40,340
Jon Anik, alongside the billionaire
fighting promoter, J.J. Riley,

118
00:10:40,424 --> 00:10:42,467
the Tapout crew is here, Punk
and Skrape are in the building.

119
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:44,469
Now, J.J., what led
to this project

120
00:10:44,553 --> 00:10:47,013
that is really redefining mixed
martial arts here in the States?

121
00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:50,558
Well, mixed martial arts is a sport
I've been incredibly passionate about,

122
00:10:50,643 --> 00:10:53,311
and as far as where the
idea for Sparta came from,

123
00:10:53,395 --> 00:10:57,190
I've always really dug the Grand Prix
format, so I tracked these guys down.

124
00:10:57,316 --> 00:10:59,442
And when J.J. came to us,
he said he wanted to create

125
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,069
the Super Bowl of
mixed martial arts.

126
00:11:01,236 --> 00:11:04,238
And he decided to put up
the $5 million purse, too.

127
00:11:04,365 --> 00:11:08,284
Well, there you have it, it shall be done.
Hedge fund king, J.J. Riley,

128
00:11:08,369 --> 00:11:10,912
going from the lions' den
of Wall Street to the cage,

129
00:11:10,996 --> 00:11:15,667
and promoting the biggest winner-take-all
tournament in MMA history. Sparta...

130
00:11:15,751 --> 00:11:16,793
Doing good. One more time.

131
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:18,920
Fitzy still own this?

132
00:11:19,004 --> 00:11:22,256
I don't know no Fitzy.
Colt Boyd owns this gym.

133
00:11:22,758 --> 00:11:25,009
Can I help you with something?

134
00:11:26,929 --> 00:11:28,596
How does it work?

135
00:11:29,098 --> 00:11:30,598
Thirty-five a month with locker.

136
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,851
We're open at 7:00,
lights out at 11:00.

137
00:11:35,396 --> 00:11:37,355
So you want to join?

138
00:11:37,815 --> 00:11:38,940
Sure.

139
00:11:40,484 --> 00:11:43,736
Put your name and contact
info on the card.

140
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,864
Thank you.

141
00:11:57,835 --> 00:12:00,878
All right. There's a
lesson in this, too, okay?

142
00:12:01,005 --> 00:12:02,213
Hold on, Tito.

143
00:12:02,297 --> 00:12:03,506
So, we have a body at rest,

144
00:12:04,341 --> 00:12:06,092
and you have the
bat which needs...

145
00:12:06,176 --> 00:12:08,052
- Acceleration.
- Acceleration, okay.

146
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,471
If you have enough acceleration,

147
00:12:10,556 --> 00:12:12,140
you might have a chance of
breaking the body at rest.

148
00:12:12,307 --> 00:12:13,850
- Okay. All right. You ready?
- Piece of cake.

149
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:16,519
Everybody got the glasses on?
Okay, go! Piece of cake!

150
00:12:17,021 --> 00:12:18,062
Come on, man!

151
00:12:19,815 --> 00:12:20,898
Come on, son!

152
00:12:22,693 --> 00:12:26,821
All right! All right. There we go.
Well done, Tito. Well done.

153
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:29,824
Remind me not to mess with you.

154
00:12:31,452 --> 00:12:33,870
Sit down, everybody.
Dial it down.

155
00:12:34,496 --> 00:12:36,247
So, have we got it?

156
00:12:36,415 --> 00:12:38,958
Force equals mass times
acceleration, we got it.

157
00:12:39,043 --> 00:12:40,501
All right. Has
everybody else got it?

158
00:12:40,878 --> 00:12:42,670
- Yeah.
- Yes? Okay, good. All right.

159
00:12:43,505 --> 00:12:44,505
The third law...

160
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,674
How many laws this dude got?

161
00:12:47,176 --> 00:12:48,593
- The dude?
- Yes, the dude.

162
00:12:48,677 --> 00:12:50,553
The dude has three, all right?

163
00:12:50,846 --> 00:12:54,515
Newton, the dude, says
that for every action,

164
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:58,519
there is an equal and
opposite reaction.

165
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,938
For example,

166
00:13:01,023 --> 00:13:05,193
if K.C. does not stop the action
of sending texts in class

167
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,987
and tell her posse
outside to beat it,

168
00:13:08,072 --> 00:13:11,824
then my reaction might be to send her
down to Principal Zito's office.

169
00:13:11,909 --> 00:13:15,203
Thus setting the world
back in proper balance.

170
00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:16,537
Mr. C, I put it away.

171
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:23,044
All right, before you go, I
have your tests from last week.

172
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:26,005
Just work it out.

173
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:27,673
Stop clowning.

174
00:13:28,884 --> 00:13:29,926
Pick up the hands.

175
00:13:33,305 --> 00:13:34,722
Tighten it up!

176
00:13:36,433 --> 00:13:37,767
Use your right.

177
00:13:38,393 --> 00:13:40,394
Seal his hands, come on.

178
00:13:40,979 --> 00:13:43,147
Seal his hands.
Keep your hands up!

179
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:45,191
Go light!

180
00:13:46,777 --> 00:13:48,236
I said, go light!

181
00:13:52,074 --> 00:13:53,324
God damn it!

182
00:13:55,119 --> 00:13:56,369
Where do you find these girls?

183
00:13:58,747 --> 00:14:01,374
We got a tournament coming up, you're
gonna play every guy in the 'Burgh?

184
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:03,459
Oh, jeez.

185
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,545
Fenroy, get me some ice.

186
00:14:05,838 --> 00:14:08,339
And call that Puerto Rican kid, the
one that fights out of the bottoms.

187
00:14:08,423 --> 00:14:11,342
If he's here in 20 minutes,
he gets 200 bucks.

188
00:14:11,426 --> 00:14:13,052
Yo, I'll fight him.

189
00:14:13,137 --> 00:14:14,762
Do me a favor, guy,
go back to your bag.

190
00:14:14,847 --> 00:14:17,098
We don't need anybody else getting hurt.
Take a walk.

191
00:14:17,182 --> 00:14:19,600
Let's go. Watch his neck.

192
00:14:20,853 --> 00:14:21,894
Yo, Rock, what did you do,

193
00:14:21,979 --> 00:14:23,688
did you leave Mick and
Paulie at home today?

194
00:14:29,153 --> 00:14:30,153
His phone's disconnected.

195
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:32,947
Then go through the list. Find me somebody.
Get me Joe Bones.

196
00:14:33,657 --> 00:14:36,492
All I'm saying is that if you
need somebody to help you,

197
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:40,288
I'm happy to keep your
boy warm for you.

198
00:14:51,633 --> 00:14:52,884
You ever fought before?

199
00:14:52,968 --> 00:14:53,968
Yeah.

200
00:14:57,431 --> 00:14:58,806
Hey, this guy signed a waiver?

201
00:15:00,642 --> 00:15:01,934
All good.

202
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:07,273
- What's your name?
- Tommy.

203
00:15:07,983 --> 00:15:10,943
- You get tuned up in here, it's on you, Tom.
- Sure, no problem. No problem.

204
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:14,488
Come on in.

205
00:15:22,539 --> 00:15:24,457
Let's go. All right, let's go.

206
00:15:25,334 --> 00:15:26,500
Hey. Watch that teeth.

207
00:15:27,461 --> 00:15:29,712
Are you gonna be a hero?
All right.

208
00:15:35,761 --> 00:15:37,011
Come on. Check that kick.

209
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,471
Easy.

210
00:15:39,014 --> 00:15:41,182
Come on, Dog, you can do it.
Let's go, come on.

211
00:15:42,935 --> 00:15:45,019
- Good jab. Good jab!
- There we go!

212
00:15:51,735 --> 00:15:54,362
No, he won't. Don't let him take your back.
Don't let him take your back!

213
00:15:54,446 --> 00:15:55,446
- Dog, get up.
- Get up!

214
00:15:57,366 --> 00:15:58,449
Cover up, cover up!

215
00:15:59,368 --> 00:16:01,035
Don't give him your back.
Don't give him your back!

216
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,374
- Cover up!
- Come on, Dog!

217
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:09,335
Cover up, damn it!

218
00:16:27,145 --> 00:16:28,938
You owe me 200 bucks.

219
00:16:46,623 --> 00:16:49,292
This one here. See, this is
the new appraisal figures

220
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:50,459
- that came in.
- Yeah.

221
00:16:50,544 --> 00:16:52,712
And this is how it affects the
monthly, it turns into that.

222
00:16:52,796 --> 00:16:55,673
And the total value of the loan,
over the life of the loan, is that.

223
00:16:55,757 --> 00:16:57,008
As you can see, that's
just the way it is.

224
00:16:57,092 --> 00:16:58,718
It puts you upside down,
that's the problem.

225
00:16:58,802 --> 00:17:00,970
It's the county that did the
assessment, not the bank.

226
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:03,431
So, the numbers are what they are, Mr.
Conlon...

227
00:17:03,515 --> 00:17:05,599
- Brendan.
- The numbers are what they are, Brendan.

228
00:17:05,726 --> 00:17:07,685
I mean, you're a math teacher, right?
You can appreciate that.

229
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:10,479
I'm a physics teacher.
I teach physics.

230
00:17:10,605 --> 00:17:14,108
Physics, okay. But the bank has got
to go by the new appraisal figures.

231
00:17:14,192 --> 00:17:16,861
And, according to these figures,
you're upside down on your mortgage,

232
00:17:16,945 --> 00:17:18,612
- you understand?
- God, you said that like three times.

233
00:17:19,281 --> 00:17:20,656
I'm sorry, but I get that.

234
00:17:20,741 --> 00:17:24,035
I am asking you, is there
something else you can do?

235
00:17:24,286 --> 00:17:27,621
Not the bank, you. Can you shift
things around, restructure?

236
00:17:27,706 --> 00:17:29,206
You refinanced twice already.

237
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,958
'Cause you advised
us to do that.

238
00:17:31,335 --> 00:17:33,419
- You told me.
- Well, I presented you with that option,

239
00:17:33,503 --> 00:17:34,795
but that was your choice.

240
00:17:35,756 --> 00:17:39,675
I'm also showing that you netted a
substantial payout with the refi.

241
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:42,094
We had that conversation.

242
00:17:43,388 --> 00:17:45,514
I was paying medical bills.

243
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:49,560
Oh, right. Sorry. Your
daughter's kidney?

244
00:17:50,312 --> 00:17:52,480
- Heart.
- Heart. Right, sorry.

245
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:54,940
A lot of stories.

246
00:17:56,318 --> 00:17:59,070
All right, so, if that's my
option, I have no options.

247
00:17:59,154 --> 00:18:01,405
You're not even gonna try and help me.
You're not even gonna try.

248
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:04,283
No, I'm trying. Look, Brendan, I
can get you 90 days to get even.

249
00:18:04,368 --> 00:18:06,410
Ninety days is not enough.

250
00:18:07,245 --> 00:18:10,164
My wife and I, we have
three jobs between us.

251
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,876
And that doesn't cut it.

252
00:18:14,169 --> 00:18:16,504
So, what do you suggest?

253
00:18:16,922 --> 00:18:20,174
Well, let me ask you a question?
Have you thought about bankruptcy?

254
00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:22,343
It's a viable option.

255
00:18:22,803 --> 00:18:25,346
There's no shame in
this these days.

256
00:18:29,518 --> 00:18:31,811
That's not how I do things.

257
00:18:33,188 --> 00:18:37,024
Okay, well, then you're
looking at foreclosure.

258
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,870
Utter domination by Tommy Conlon, the
undefeated freshman from Pittsburgh.

259
00:18:49,955 --> 00:18:53,499
The prodigy has yet to yield a single
point in the entire tournament.

260
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:55,793
Tommy, trained by his father
since the age of five.

261
00:18:55,877 --> 00:18:58,712
- Talking about Paddy Conlon?
- The controversial Paddy Conlon.

262
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,423
Say what you will about the
methods of the former Marine,

263
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:04,218
but he's led his son to six
straight Junior Olympic titles

264
00:19:04,302 --> 00:19:07,054
and now just moments away from a
High School State Championship.

265
00:19:07,139 --> 00:19:09,306
And there it is! Wow!

266
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:12,309
There's just no limit to what
the future holds for this kid.

267
00:19:12,394 --> 00:19:14,979
Tommy told me that he's chasing
the record of Theogenes,

268
00:19:15,063 --> 00:19:18,816
apparently, a mythical Greek fighter said
to be undefeated in over 1,400 bouts.

269
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,988
Hi, how're you doing, sir? I'm
looking for Tommy Riordan.

270
00:19:24,906 --> 00:19:26,699
- Who?
- Tommy Riordan.

271
00:19:26,867 --> 00:19:28,659
My name is Colt Boyd.

272
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,580
What business you
got with Tommy?

273
00:19:32,664 --> 00:19:35,791
Well, none yet, that's why I'm here.
I manage fighters.

274
00:19:38,628 --> 00:19:40,796
So, Tommy's been
working out at my gym,

275
00:19:43,008 --> 00:19:46,760
and he put a beating on the number one
middleweight contender in the world today.

276
00:19:46,887 --> 00:19:50,181
So, I want to know a little
bit more about the guy.

277
00:19:50,265 --> 00:19:52,183
Maybe help him out.

278
00:19:52,767 --> 00:19:54,727
I have a lot of contacts, Mr.
Riordan.

279
00:19:54,895 --> 00:19:57,313
Conlon. The name is Conlon.

280
00:19:58,481 --> 00:20:01,025
And anything you wanna
know about Tommy,

281
00:20:01,109 --> 00:20:02,818
you gotta ask him yourself.

282
00:20:02,944 --> 00:20:04,945
Look, I'm just asking for some
general information here.

283
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,489
Like I said, anything you
wanna know about Tommy,

284
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:09,116
you gotta ask him yourself.

285
00:20:09,284 --> 00:20:10,868
Look, I don't mean to
interrupt your night, okay?

286
00:20:10,952 --> 00:20:13,287
He just put this address down
when he signed up at the gym.

287
00:20:13,496 --> 00:20:15,289
He doesn't live here.

288
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,627
- All right, then.
- Okay. Good night.

289
00:20:27,802 --> 00:20:31,764
All right, listen, kiddo. I need
you to put Mommy back on, okay?

290
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:33,974
I love you.

291
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:37,144
Hey. Hey, listen, I'm just pulling
in, I'm gonna have to go.

292
00:20:39,773 --> 00:20:43,776
No, they got an open mic night thing
on, it's gonna be a quiet one.

293
00:20:45,528 --> 00:20:47,321
All right, sleep well.

294
00:20:47,405 --> 00:20:48,864
You, too. All right, bye.

295
00:20:54,371 --> 00:20:56,997
It's about time for
your next contest.

296
00:20:57,332 --> 00:21:02,419
Introducing first, in the red corner,
he fights out of Ripley, West Virginia.

297
00:21:02,504 --> 00:21:07,299
Please welcome Mike
"The Mutilator" Moore.

298
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:08,467
Say, "Uncle!"

299
00:21:08,718 --> 00:21:10,052
Go, Mike. Go!

300
00:21:13,682 --> 00:21:19,228
And his opponent in the blue corner, he
fights out of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

301
00:21:19,521 --> 00:21:23,691
Please welcome "Irish"
Brendan Conlon.

302
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:31,281
This bout is scheduled for
three, five-minute rounds,

303
00:21:31,408 --> 00:21:35,244
and when the action begins,
your referee is Mr. Rick Fike.

304
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:37,871
Fighters to the center.

305
00:21:40,542 --> 00:21:41,625
Come on, gentlemen.

306
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,794
I want you to obey my
commands at all times.

307
00:21:43,878 --> 00:21:46,005
I want you to protect
yourselves at all times.

308
00:21:46,089 --> 00:21:48,424
If you have no questions,
touch gloves, back up.

309
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:51,010
And on my signal, let's
come out fighting.

310
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,976
Fighter, are you ready?

311
00:21:59,227 --> 00:22:00,394
Are you ready?

312
00:22:00,562 --> 00:22:01,645
Do it!

313
00:22:11,656 --> 00:22:13,073
Come on, Mike, let's go!

314
00:22:24,294 --> 00:22:25,711
You gotta move with that one.

315
00:22:42,937 --> 00:22:43,937
Come on, Mike!

316
00:22:54,324 --> 00:22:56,450
Don't let him do
that to you, Mike!

317
00:23:01,164 --> 00:23:02,164
Get up, Mike, get up!

318
00:23:19,682 --> 00:23:21,934
- First five minutes, out.
- Another 15? Great.

319
00:23:24,104 --> 00:23:25,979
Hey! Hey, kid!

320
00:23:26,397 --> 00:23:29,650
Nice fight. Two more wins,
you take home the bacon.

321
00:23:29,818 --> 00:23:31,026
Hey, good job...

322
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:46,917
Hey, babe.

323
00:23:47,168 --> 00:23:48,252
Hey.

324
00:24:17,407 --> 00:24:19,199
How was work?

325
00:24:23,746 --> 00:24:25,289
Oh, my God!

326
00:24:28,543 --> 00:24:30,043
What happened?

327
00:24:30,545 --> 00:24:33,172
You said it was gonna
be a slow night.

328
00:24:35,884 --> 00:24:38,093
I'm not bouncing at a club.

329
00:24:40,638 --> 00:24:43,223
What do you mean
you're not bouncing?

330
00:25:01,618 --> 00:25:03,410
You've been lying to me?

331
00:25:07,207 --> 00:25:09,249
I went in to apply

332
00:25:12,837 --> 00:25:15,589
and they were paying
nine bucks an hour.

333
00:25:19,469 --> 00:25:24,014
Then I saw a sign for
this other thing.

334
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:33,023
They're putting us out of
the house in three months.

335
00:25:33,107 --> 00:25:34,191
We're running out of options.

336
00:25:34,275 --> 00:25:35,943
Then they put us out of the
house in three months.

337
00:25:36,236 --> 00:25:37,778
I'd rather go back
to the old apartment

338
00:25:37,862 --> 00:25:40,948
than see you in the back
of an ambulance again.

339
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:44,117
I thought we agreed that we
weren't gonna raise our children

340
00:25:44,202 --> 00:25:47,788
in a family where their father
gets beat up for a living.

341
00:25:51,751 --> 00:25:54,294
We're not giving up the house.

342
00:25:54,462 --> 00:25:56,213
It's our home.

343
00:25:57,465 --> 00:25:59,174
We're not going backwards.

344
00:26:12,272 --> 00:26:14,022
We'll figure it out.

345
00:26:16,484 --> 00:26:19,111
This is what we're
not going back to.

346
00:27:16,878 --> 00:27:18,879
You wanted to talk?

347
00:27:20,673 --> 00:27:21,757
Yeah.

348
00:27:24,302 --> 00:27:26,303
I'm gonna start fighting.

349
00:27:27,138 --> 00:27:28,180
Is that right?

350
00:27:28,264 --> 00:27:29,306
Don't play babe in
the woods with me.

351
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:31,725
I know that guy from the
gym came to see you.

352
00:27:31,809 --> 00:27:33,310
Colt Boyd.

353
00:27:33,603 --> 00:27:36,521
Yeah. I didn't tell
him anything, Tommy.

354
00:27:36,898 --> 00:27:40,025
I wouldn't be sitting here
with you now if you did.

355
00:27:40,109 --> 00:27:42,402
- Paddy, can I get you more coffee?
- No. Thank you. I'm fine.

356
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:45,489
- Hon, would you like a cup of coffee? Okay.
- Sure. Thank you.

357
00:27:47,867 --> 00:27:49,618
All right.

358
00:27:49,827 --> 00:27:51,787
There's this tournament,

359
00:27:51,954 --> 00:27:53,455
it's a big tournament.

360
00:27:54,665 --> 00:27:57,834
Top 16 middleweights in the world.
Single elimination.

361
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,712
Winner takes all.
It's a lot of money.

362
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,174
- Okay.
- I'm gonna do that.

363
00:28:06,427 --> 00:28:08,136
But if I'm doing it,

364
00:28:11,557 --> 00:28:14,267
then I'm gonna need a trainer.

365
00:28:14,977 --> 00:28:17,104
Now, that much,
you were good at.

366
00:28:19,357 --> 00:28:20,649
What?

367
00:28:20,817 --> 00:28:23,777
No, no, no. This doesn't
mean anything, okay?

368
00:28:24,362 --> 00:28:25,946
I'm serious.

369
00:28:26,239 --> 00:28:28,073
We train. That's it.

370
00:28:28,157 --> 00:28:30,700
I don't want to hear a word
about anything but training.

371
00:28:30,785 --> 00:28:32,327
You understand?

372
00:28:32,787 --> 00:28:36,331
You want to tell your war stories,
you can take them down to the VFW.

373
00:28:36,457 --> 00:28:39,793
Or you can take it to a
meeting, or to church,

374
00:28:39,877 --> 00:28:42,295
or whatever the hell it
is that you do nowadays.

375
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,089
What about Colt Boyd?

376
00:28:44,173 --> 00:28:46,675
What about him? I told him I don't
train with people that I don't know.

377
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:49,177
- The devil you know.
- Excuse me?

378
00:28:49,637 --> 00:28:53,306
The devil you know is better
than the devil you don't.

379
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,978
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

380
00:28:58,479 --> 00:29:00,272
There's your coffee, hon.

381
00:29:00,982 --> 00:29:02,190
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

382
00:29:02,733 --> 00:29:06,820
Chasing Theogenes. It'll be
kind of like the old times.

383
00:29:07,822 --> 00:29:10,574
I just told you, this
doesn't mean anything.

384
00:29:11,617 --> 00:29:14,453
Now, get that through your skull
right now or I'm walking.

385
00:29:14,537 --> 00:29:16,371
All right. All right.

386
00:29:16,664 --> 00:29:19,082
But you get something
through your skull, too.

387
00:29:19,167 --> 00:29:23,336
You called me, so don't go threatening
to walk every five minutes.

388
00:29:25,298 --> 00:29:27,507
And since this is
about training,

389
00:29:27,842 --> 00:29:31,470
you dump whatever it is you need to dump
as far as those pills are concerned.

390
00:29:31,554 --> 00:29:33,472
I don't wanna see them.

391
00:29:34,223 --> 00:29:36,683
In fact, hand them
over right now.

392
00:29:39,228 --> 00:29:40,604
I know they're on you, Tommy.

393
00:29:40,813 --> 00:29:44,441
You sounded like a goddamn
maraca coming through the door.

394
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:58,121
That's not gonna do.

395
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:03,877
When you came through
that door, it was...

396
00:30:06,672 --> 00:30:07,839
Three.

397
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,931
That'a boy.

398
00:30:17,642 --> 00:30:20,310
And another thing. You
don't eat crap like this.

399
00:30:20,394 --> 00:30:22,562
This is for losers and old men.

400
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,316
And we're gonna have to bunk up.

401
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,652
If we're gonna do this right,
you're gonna stay at the house.

402
00:30:29,403 --> 00:30:32,405
I watch your diet. We
follow the old regimen.

403
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:35,283
You copy?

404
00:30:37,912 --> 00:30:38,912
All right.

405
00:30:40,414 --> 00:30:41,748
Copy.

406
00:30:56,097 --> 00:30:57,097
Your brother's a liar.

407
00:30:57,181 --> 00:30:58,682
- ...went in the middle of the night...
- Yeah.

408
00:30:58,766 --> 00:31:01,268
And he went to a strip club,
and he said he saw Mr. C...

409
00:31:01,352 --> 00:31:02,561
- No way.
- Front and center.

410
00:31:02,645 --> 00:31:04,938
- Like MMA type stuff.
- You weren't there, so you don't know.

411
00:31:05,022 --> 00:31:06,022
What's MMA?

412
00:31:06,107 --> 00:31:07,065
- Mixed martial arts.
- Like, fighting.

413
00:31:07,149 --> 00:31:08,525
Like, different
styles of fighting.

414
00:31:08,609 --> 00:31:10,944
He was just, like, dropped
him on the floor...

415
00:31:16,284 --> 00:31:17,325
It's true?

416
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,327
Take your seats.

417
00:31:19,412 --> 00:31:20,745
Now, please.

418
00:31:32,174 --> 00:31:34,009
Hey, yo, Mr. C.

419
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:36,511
Hey, my brother was at the
titty bar last night,

420
00:31:36,596 --> 00:31:40,140
and he said you was choking brothers out.
I mean, what's up, is it true?

421
00:31:40,308 --> 00:31:42,309
Yeah, Mr. C. I mean,
like, is it true?

422
00:31:42,393 --> 00:31:44,227
Did you really work on
some fools or something?

423
00:31:44,312 --> 00:31:46,229
- You have to tell us.
- Yeah.

424
00:31:57,199 --> 00:32:00,577
All right. I want examples
of forms of energy.

425
00:32:20,848 --> 00:32:22,766
Come on. It's not
as bad as it looks.

426
00:32:23,476 --> 00:32:27,937
Are you being literal or figurative?
Because, literally, it looks bad.

427
00:32:28,022 --> 00:32:31,483
And figuratively, it
looks even worse.

428
00:32:31,609 --> 00:32:33,777
The superintendent's coming by.
Few minutes.

429
00:32:36,739 --> 00:32:37,739
Oh, man.

430
00:32:38,491 --> 00:32:41,034
So, come on, Brendan. Give
me a little help here.

431
00:32:41,285 --> 00:32:45,538
I mean, could you explain to me
what the hell you were doing?

432
00:32:50,503 --> 00:32:51,878
I need the money, Joe.

433
00:32:52,797 --> 00:32:54,631
Yeah, but this is...

434
00:32:54,757 --> 00:32:56,424
We can't have this.

435
00:32:56,509 --> 00:32:59,844
This isn't moonlighting at
Applebee's, for Christ's sake.

436
00:33:00,721 --> 00:33:02,806
Shit, Brendan.

437
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:05,809
Leaving everything else
aside, which we can't,

438
00:33:05,893 --> 00:33:07,727
are you out of your mind?

439
00:33:07,895 --> 00:33:09,979
You're gonna get
yourself killed.

440
00:33:10,064 --> 00:33:11,648
I mean, you're a
goddamn teacher.

441
00:33:11,732 --> 00:33:14,234
You got no business in the
ring with those animals.

442
00:33:16,153 --> 00:33:18,822
Actually, I used to be
one of those animals.

443
00:33:21,867 --> 00:33:23,868
I fought for a living.

444
00:33:25,538 --> 00:33:28,456
Guess I forgot to put that
down on my application.

445
00:33:30,209 --> 00:33:32,252
Yeah, I guess you did.

446
00:33:32,878 --> 00:33:34,713
Look, I'm sorry, Joe.
It's just...

447
00:33:34,797 --> 00:33:37,632
Look, look, the school
district is not gonna tolerate

448
00:33:37,717 --> 00:33:39,801
teachers cockfighting
in strip clubs.

449
00:33:39,927 --> 00:33:42,512
It was a parking lot
of a strip club.

450
00:33:42,596 --> 00:33:44,973
Wherever it was, you
can't be doing it.

451
00:33:45,266 --> 00:33:49,978
All right? I mean, this is a serious...
Shit, he's here.

452
00:33:50,062 --> 00:33:52,439
This is a serious problem.

453
00:33:56,902 --> 00:33:59,988
Guy hasn't been inside
a school since 9/11.

454
00:34:02,616 --> 00:34:04,617
What are we gonna do?

455
00:34:05,536 --> 00:34:08,705
You say, "Yes, sir," and
you say, "No, sir,"

456
00:34:08,789 --> 00:34:11,750
and you say, "it will
never happen again, sir."

457
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:16,171
And then we just pray to God
that he's in a good mood.

458
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:23,511
UFC?

459
00:34:25,806 --> 00:34:27,307
Yeah.

460
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,018
Son of a bitch.

461
00:34:32,313 --> 00:34:34,647
- Superintendent Yorn. Good to see you, sir.
- Principal Zito.

462
00:34:53,167 --> 00:34:54,751
What are you doing?

463
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:58,713
Well,

464
00:34:58,798 --> 00:35:02,175
the girls have an important
piano recital in the morning.

465
00:35:03,344 --> 00:35:06,054
And we have an
equipment malfunction.

466
00:35:10,351 --> 00:35:11,810
How'd it go?

467
00:35:12,394 --> 00:35:16,773
They're gonna review your case
at the end of the semester.

468
00:35:16,857 --> 00:35:21,361
But until then, you're
suspended without pay.

469
00:35:27,952 --> 00:35:30,703
Joe gave me the number
of his attorney.

470
00:35:32,414 --> 00:35:34,415
How the hell are we gonna
pay for an attorney?

471
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,669
He talked to me for
free as a favor to Joe.

472
00:35:37,753 --> 00:35:39,963
That's nice.

473
00:35:40,047 --> 00:35:41,714
He said there's no
precedent for this.

474
00:35:42,466 --> 00:35:44,968
You'll be back by next semester.

475
00:35:45,052 --> 00:35:47,053
The next semester?

476
00:35:57,398 --> 00:35:58,815
Tess,

477
00:36:00,401 --> 00:36:03,069
they have these smoker
fights all over.

478
00:36:04,572 --> 00:36:09,033
There's one in Lancaster next week,
there's two in Dover the week after.

479
00:36:09,118 --> 00:36:12,245
Wilmington, Camden, Baltimore.

480
00:36:16,375 --> 00:36:19,085
That could keep us afloat.

481
00:36:19,712 --> 00:36:24,382
You're gonna put yourself through this
over and over for 500 bucks a pop?

482
00:36:27,261 --> 00:36:29,637
Some of them pay a
lot more than that.

483
00:36:32,433 --> 00:36:36,519
I would have to bounce for a month to
make what I made in two hours last night.

484
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,439
Yeah.

485
00:36:42,026 --> 00:36:44,569
And these guys, they're
not real fighters.

486
00:36:45,905 --> 00:36:49,198
They're just guys that have
seen too much UFC on TV.

487
00:36:55,372 --> 00:36:58,750
Now, if you have a
better solution,

488
00:36:58,834 --> 00:37:01,127
I'm all ears, but...

489
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:06,591
And what are we gonna
tell the girls?

490
00:37:07,509 --> 00:37:09,719
It'll be fine.

491
00:37:09,803 --> 00:37:12,388
I'll just leave the
house as usual,

492
00:37:12,473 --> 00:37:15,516
except, only this time,
I'll be going to the gym.

493
00:37:28,155 --> 00:37:31,157
The duck goes quack,
quack, quack, quack.

494
00:37:32,201 --> 00:37:36,037
And the cow goes moo, moo, moo!

495
00:37:36,163 --> 00:37:41,292
But that rooster That
rooster, he knew everything.

496
00:37:41,502 --> 00:37:46,923
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

497
00:37:47,007 --> 00:37:49,801
Let's go, kiddo.
Let's get moving.

498
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:53,346
Look what I found

499
00:37:53,681 --> 00:37:56,057
in that disaster of a...

500
00:37:58,018 --> 00:37:59,435
basement.

501
00:38:00,896 --> 00:38:03,898
What do you say we sit down

502
00:38:05,401 --> 00:38:07,110
and update this?

503
00:38:08,529 --> 00:38:12,657
And you can fill me in on how
close you got to that record.

504
00:38:16,078 --> 00:38:20,498
Did you continue wrestling after
you left with your mother?

505
00:38:25,129 --> 00:38:27,296
Come on, Tommy.
Tell me something.

506
00:38:29,842 --> 00:38:31,384
Yeah, I'll tell you something.

507
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:36,097
You can take that back
to where you found it,

508
00:38:36,181 --> 00:38:38,641
you can leave the
coffee in the pot.

509
00:38:38,726 --> 00:38:41,519
I can pour that myself.

510
00:38:41,603 --> 00:38:44,063
And I can wake myself up, too.

511
00:38:56,076 --> 00:38:58,119
Hurt my knees coming up
and down those stairs.

512
00:38:58,203 --> 00:38:59,662
Yeah?

513
00:38:59,747 --> 00:39:04,292
I'll leave the coffee pot on
until 0500, then I dump it.

514
00:39:11,091 --> 00:39:14,385
I give command dismiss. You'll
wash your nasty bodies.

515
00:39:15,763 --> 00:39:18,181
You can square your gear away.

516
00:39:18,265 --> 00:39:20,975
Corporal Bradford, take this to
CSC, let them know we're back.

517
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,477
Roger, sir.

518
00:39:23,312 --> 00:39:25,688
Detail, a-ten-hut!

519
00:39:26,231 --> 00:39:28,649
7-3-4, this is Gealer Base.
Sitrep, over.

520
00:39:30,652 --> 00:39:32,862
What's up, Mark?

521
00:39:32,946 --> 00:39:35,531
Here, sir. William's
Company's back in.

522
00:39:35,616 --> 00:39:37,658
Damn, dude! That's brutal.

523
00:39:37,743 --> 00:39:39,410
- Did you see that? Oh, my God.
- What?

524
00:39:39,495 --> 00:39:40,578
What's that?

525
00:39:40,662 --> 00:39:44,373
Dude, Mad Dog Grimes is getting tuned
up by some dude at a gym in Pittsburgh.

526
00:39:44,458 --> 00:39:45,917
Who is Mad Dog Grimes?

527
00:39:46,001 --> 00:39:48,461
Shit, Bradford, the stuff
you don't know amazes me.

528
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:51,297
- Dude. Oh, my God, did you see that?
- Wow. Oh, my God.

529
00:39:51,381 --> 00:39:53,758
- Wait. Rewind that.
- Okay.

530
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:58,763
Right there, pause,
pause, pause.

531
00:40:01,934 --> 00:40:03,351
What's up, man?

532
00:40:06,313 --> 00:40:07,563
Dude, what's his deal?

533
00:40:13,237 --> 00:40:14,487
You're not gonna get your 11.

534
00:40:15,197 --> 00:40:17,657
- AV, I need to see the tape.
- What tape?

535
00:40:18,075 --> 00:40:19,659
- What tape?
- The tape!

536
00:40:22,996 --> 00:40:24,997
Hoolihan, fill in for me?

537
00:40:25,415 --> 00:40:26,415
Get the camera.

538
00:41:02,202 --> 00:41:07,874
That's him.

539
00:41:09,877 --> 00:41:12,753
Let the music sink into you.
This is Beethoven.

540
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:16,340
I want you to breathe. I don't want you
boxing like this. No more stiff, right?

541
00:41:16,425 --> 00:41:19,427
You listen to the music. You
relax, you breathe. One, two...

542
00:41:23,849 --> 00:41:27,143
Again. One, two. One, two.
One, two.

543
00:41:32,399 --> 00:41:33,399
Good.

544
00:41:33,734 --> 00:41:35,902
Good, good, good. Yos.

545
00:41:37,404 --> 00:41:40,656
You're gonna get it, you're gonna get it.
All right? Two more rounds.

546
00:41:46,747 --> 00:41:48,039
Do I know you?

547
00:41:50,709 --> 00:41:51,751
- Oh, man!
- Wow.

548
00:41:51,835 --> 00:41:54,670
- Long time, brother. Too long.
- How you doing?

549
00:41:54,755 --> 00:41:56,047
- Too long.
- Look at your place.

550
00:41:56,131 --> 00:41:57,131
- You like?
- Yeah.

551
00:41:57,716 --> 00:42:01,052
You see this beast?
Marco Santos.

552
00:42:01,136 --> 00:42:03,012
- He's training for Sparta.
- Yeah, right.

553
00:42:03,096 --> 00:42:04,472
Not bad, right?

554
00:42:04,556 --> 00:42:06,265
It's amazing, man.

555
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:10,144
Only the best. Move! Move!
Move! Move or die!

556
00:42:11,772 --> 00:42:13,940
- You look good, brother.
- Thanks.

557
00:42:18,195 --> 00:42:20,363
How are the girls?

558
00:42:20,447 --> 00:42:23,282
Good. Yeah. I had another
little one, Rosie.

559
00:42:23,367 --> 00:42:27,370
I know. I know because Johnny C. Told me
that she was in the hospital for a bit.

560
00:42:27,454 --> 00:42:28,746
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

561
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:31,916
You know,

562
00:42:34,336 --> 00:42:36,879
I was gonna call you and
then time went by and...

563
00:42:36,964 --> 00:42:38,798
I'm a piece of shit. I should've
called you. I'm sorry.

564
00:42:38,882 --> 00:42:39,882
- No. Come on.
- No.

565
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:43,552
Brendan, I'm sorry.

566
00:42:44,263 --> 00:42:46,514
It's all good. She's good now.

567
00:42:46,598 --> 00:42:48,557
- She's okay?
- So beautiful.

568
00:42:52,437 --> 00:42:57,400
It's good to see you, man. So
everything's going great, huh?

569
00:42:57,484 --> 00:42:58,901
Yeah.

570
00:42:59,861 --> 00:43:03,364
Well, I've got a little problem.

571
00:43:06,034 --> 00:43:08,411
The guys at the bank want
to take my house away.

572
00:43:08,495 --> 00:43:10,246
- What?
- Yeah.

573
00:43:10,998 --> 00:43:13,833
That's kind of why I came
to see you, actually.

574
00:43:18,213 --> 00:43:21,674
You know, I got most of my
dough tied up in this joint,

575
00:43:21,758 --> 00:43:22,925
but how much do you need?

576
00:43:23,051 --> 00:43:24,844
I didn't come here
for a loan, Frank.

577
00:43:25,846 --> 00:43:27,680
I mean, I was hoping that

578
00:43:30,058 --> 00:43:32,143
you would train me.

579
00:43:32,936 --> 00:43:33,936
Train you for what?

580
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:36,355
I wanna get back in the cage.

581
00:43:37,691 --> 00:43:38,691
Are you serious?

582
00:43:42,029 --> 00:43:43,446
Come on, Brendan.

583
00:43:43,739 --> 00:43:45,364
I won an event the other night.

584
00:43:46,074 --> 00:43:49,493
You won an event.
That's what this is.

585
00:43:49,578 --> 00:43:53,247
Let me guess. It was in a parking lot?
DJ from a local radio station,

586
00:43:53,332 --> 00:43:56,834
a couple of ring card girls you
wouldn't bang on a dare? Am I right?

587
00:43:58,712 --> 00:44:00,421
- Ish.
- Ish.

588
00:44:01,465 --> 00:44:03,883
Brendan. I love you.

589
00:44:04,634 --> 00:44:06,385
Why am I gonna train you?

590
00:44:07,637 --> 00:44:10,056
When you were on the right side of
30, you were barely a .500 fighter.

591
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:13,142
You never listened to me.

592
00:44:13,226 --> 00:44:16,604
You don't listen to anyone.
These guys are animals.

593
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:21,776
You're a teacher, right?
What are you gonna do?

594
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:25,404
You're gonna come down here a couple
of days a week after detention?

595
00:44:25,489 --> 00:44:29,075
You're gonna skip out of the
girls' volleyball game early?

596
00:44:29,534 --> 00:44:32,078
I've got loads of time.
Time's not an issue.

597
00:44:33,038 --> 00:44:36,332
Parking lot thing kind
of got me suspended.

598
00:44:43,298 --> 00:44:45,883
I need to keep
working the smokers.

599
00:44:49,721 --> 00:44:51,347
Tess know about this?

600
00:44:51,431 --> 00:44:52,848
Yeah?

601
00:44:52,933 --> 00:44:55,142
'Cause the last time you fought,
I got read the riot act,

602
00:44:55,227 --> 00:44:58,104
sitting in a hospital waiting room.
You remember that?

603
00:44:58,188 --> 00:45:00,314
I was unconscious.

604
00:45:00,399 --> 00:45:04,318
- You were more than unconscious.
- I was.

605
00:45:04,403 --> 00:45:08,739
She's not gonna come down here with
the two puppies, screaming at Frank?

606
00:45:08,824 --> 00:45:12,493
It's not gonna happen.

607
00:45:12,577 --> 00:45:13,619
What do you say, Frank?

608
00:45:15,747 --> 00:45:17,498
What do I say? What am I
gonna say to you? "No"?

609
00:45:18,625 --> 00:45:20,668
I mean, all my time is
wrapped up with Marco.

610
00:45:20,752 --> 00:45:23,796
You know, you come down, I throw you in
a rotation, you spar with these guys.

611
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:28,467
But I can't promise you much
more than that, Brendan.

612
00:45:28,552 --> 00:45:29,927
That's all I need.

613
00:45:30,262 --> 00:45:32,263
Great. All right.

614
00:45:32,347 --> 00:45:33,806
Yeah.

615
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:35,933
- I appreciate it.
- What, are you kidding me?

616
00:45:36,309 --> 00:45:38,310
- You need anything, you call me.
- I will.

617
00:45:38,395 --> 00:45:39,728
Let me know when
you're coming down.

618
00:45:39,813 --> 00:45:42,356
Well, I'm just gonna get
my stuff from the car.

619
00:45:43,775 --> 00:45:44,775
Now?

620
00:46:11,178 --> 00:46:12,928
Hey, Brendan.

621
00:46:13,263 --> 00:46:16,307
Brendan, it's me, Pop.

622
00:46:21,521 --> 00:46:23,147
What are you doing here?

623
00:46:23,523 --> 00:46:25,357
I have some news for you.

624
00:46:28,862 --> 00:46:31,280
Something wrong with your hands?

625
00:46:31,364 --> 00:46:32,698
- No.
- If there's nothing wrong with your hands,

626
00:46:32,782 --> 00:46:34,158
there's no reason for
you not to phone.

627
00:46:34,868 --> 00:46:36,785
- That's the deal.
- Yeah. I forgot.

628
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:38,913
The phone or mail, Pop.
Non negotiable.

629
00:46:38,997 --> 00:46:43,042
Hey, Brendan. You ever
seen my hands so steady?

630
00:46:43,126 --> 00:46:44,710
Ever seen that?

631
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,464
I'm going inside.

632
00:46:48,548 --> 00:46:50,883
I got 1,000 days, Brendan.

633
00:46:51,885 --> 00:46:53,385
Thousand days sober, today.

634
00:46:54,971 --> 00:46:57,139
Well, that's great, Pop, but
it doesn't change anything.

635
00:46:57,224 --> 00:46:58,349
What do you mean, doesn't
change anything?

636
00:46:58,892 --> 00:47:00,518
Have a heart, Brendan.

637
00:47:00,936 --> 00:47:02,978
You listen to me.

638
00:47:03,063 --> 00:47:06,106
You take your "have a heart" bullshit
and you run it down the road.

639
00:47:07,108 --> 00:47:09,276
Yeah, run it out with someone
that doesn't know you like I do.

640
00:47:09,361 --> 00:47:13,697
All right, listen to me. I thought
maybe we could break bread.

641
00:47:13,782 --> 00:47:16,992
You know, just open some
lines of communication.

642
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:22,331
You got two lines of communication. You
got the telephone and the post office.

643
00:47:22,415 --> 00:47:23,832
God! Just 'cause you
decide it's a special day,

644
00:47:23,917 --> 00:47:25,084
it doesn't make it one for me.

645
00:47:25,168 --> 00:47:27,169
I've got a wife and kids inside,
and they're waiting for me,

646
00:47:27,254 --> 00:47:28,921
so I don't have time
for whatever this is.

647
00:47:29,005 --> 00:47:32,800
I know you got a wife and kid in there.
I've got a granddaughter in there

648
00:47:32,884 --> 00:47:34,677
I haven't seen in three years.

649
00:47:34,761 --> 00:47:36,512
And another one I
haven't even ever met.

650
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:39,598
Yeah. Why is that, Pop?

651
00:47:39,683 --> 00:47:41,600
Why is that?

652
00:47:42,936 --> 00:47:45,729
Do you remember having
anything to do with that?

653
00:47:45,814 --> 00:47:47,731
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

654
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:51,110
That shit you pulled.

655
00:47:52,404 --> 00:47:54,530
Never again.

656
00:47:55,490 --> 00:47:57,074
And all that shit
I saw growing up,

657
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:00,703
- that doesn't happen here.
- Look...

658
00:48:02,956 --> 00:48:04,123
Take care of yourself.

659
00:48:06,793 --> 00:48:08,419
Tommy's back.

660
00:48:14,884 --> 00:48:16,719
He's in the 'Burgh.

661
00:48:21,099 --> 00:48:22,391
You say Tommy's in Pittsburgh?

662
00:48:22,475 --> 00:48:24,768
Yeah, he came to see me.

663
00:48:26,896 --> 00:48:28,230
He came to see you?

664
00:48:28,982 --> 00:48:31,984
Yeah. He's over at the house.

665
00:48:32,819 --> 00:48:37,031
We're doing a little
training at Fitzy's.

666
00:48:37,157 --> 00:48:38,824
You remember Fitzy's?

667
00:48:38,908 --> 00:48:40,784
It ain't Fitzy's anymore.

668
00:48:43,455 --> 00:48:44,830
You and Tommy are
training together?

669
00:48:45,457 --> 00:48:46,582
Yeah.

670
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:49,585
- Tommy Conlon?
- Riordan.

671
00:48:49,836 --> 00:48:52,671
- He's using your mother's maiden name.
- Yeah, I know what her name is.

672
00:48:52,756 --> 00:48:57,468
Well, I thought you'd wanna know he's back.
So that's why I drove all the way over here.

673
00:48:58,011 --> 00:48:59,595
I thought you came to break
bread over 1,000 days.

674
00:48:59,679 --> 00:49:02,931
No, I did, Brendan,
that's most important.

675
00:49:03,016 --> 00:49:04,808
That, too.

676
00:49:07,604 --> 00:49:09,355
All right. Did he say
if he wants to see me?

677
00:49:11,274 --> 00:49:12,775
He doesn't say much, Brendan.

678
00:49:18,865 --> 00:49:21,867
He's just not that happy
kid he was, you know?

679
00:49:23,536 --> 00:49:25,120
- Wow. Look at you.
- What?

680
00:49:25,205 --> 00:49:26,372
Mr. inside Man.

681
00:49:26,873 --> 00:49:28,290
Inside? What?

682
00:49:28,833 --> 00:49:32,419
You and Tommy training together like
nothing ever happened. It's unbelievable.

683
00:49:32,504 --> 00:49:34,213
- Look...
- Now I know what you're really doing here.

684
00:49:34,297 --> 00:49:35,714
- What's that?
- You came to gloat.

685
00:49:35,799 --> 00:49:38,550
I did not come to gloat. I
came to get my son back.

686
00:49:38,635 --> 00:49:40,803
Wow. There you go. Yeah,
you got your son back.

687
00:49:40,887 --> 00:49:43,889
- No, I'm talking about you, Brendan. You.
- You got your son back.

688
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:50,729
You know...

689
00:49:52,732 --> 00:49:54,525
Forget it.

690
00:49:54,734 --> 00:50:00,739
Yeah, I'll tell you. Part of the reason...
Part of the reason I stuck around,

691
00:50:00,824 --> 00:50:02,908
'cause I thought I'd finally
get you all to myself.

692
00:50:06,538 --> 00:50:08,872
But you didn't have any
interest in training me.

693
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,376
- You thought Tommy was the one.
- Brendan, I was a drunk.

694
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:15,504
I mean, you know,
Brendan, I'm sorry.

695
00:50:15,588 --> 00:50:16,588
Forget it.

696
00:50:17,882 --> 00:50:22,219
You were always a frontrunner. Never
had any interest in the underdogs.

697
00:50:24,764 --> 00:50:27,599
- But I was your son.
- You are my son, Brendan.

698
00:50:27,684 --> 00:50:29,852
- Am I?
- Yeah, you are.

699
00:50:31,312 --> 00:50:34,857
I'm just asking you
if you can find...

700
00:50:36,776 --> 00:50:42,030
Find a little bit of space in your
heart to forgive me a little bit.

701
00:50:44,617 --> 00:50:48,370
Yeah? All right, I forgive you.

702
00:50:49,622 --> 00:50:52,416
- Okay.
- But I do not trust you.

703
00:50:54,502 --> 00:50:58,130
Listen, tell Tommy, if he wants
to see me, this is where I am.

704
00:50:58,923 --> 00:51:01,467
- Okay. But they're not different things.
- All right?

705
00:51:01,551 --> 00:51:03,469
You gotta trust to forgive.

706
00:51:03,803 --> 00:51:05,554
Night, Pop.

707
00:51:05,638 --> 00:51:06,764
My God.

708
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:10,851
Is that Emily? Jeez,
she's grown, Brendan.

709
00:51:11,436 --> 00:51:13,729
- Is that Rosie?
- Daddy, who is that?

710
00:51:13,813 --> 00:51:16,148
It's just a nice, old man.
Come on. Let's go.

711
00:51:16,232 --> 00:51:18,150
How about a cup of coffee?

712
00:51:34,417 --> 00:51:37,044
Huge news just
broken here at ESPN

713
00:51:37,128 --> 00:51:41,215
that Koba is coming to America
and will fight at Sparta.

714
00:51:41,382 --> 00:51:44,009
Universally considered the
greatest pound-for-pound fighter

715
00:51:44,093 --> 00:51:47,137
who ever lived, the mighty,
mythical Russian has never fought

716
00:51:47,222 --> 00:51:49,473
on US soil in his
legendary career.

717
00:51:49,682 --> 00:51:52,768
Slow to half guard. Slow to
half guard, hammer fist.

718
00:51:52,852 --> 00:51:58,065
Now start on the other side. And
slip back in, there you go.

719
00:51:58,149 --> 00:52:00,484
Tommy,

720
00:52:00,568 --> 00:52:02,945
I got some news for you.

721
00:52:03,029 --> 00:52:04,071
I got you into Sparta.

722
00:52:04,572 --> 00:52:05,989
It took some doing,

723
00:52:06,533 --> 00:52:08,116
but I made it happen.

724
00:52:12,163 --> 00:52:15,165
You know thank you and
10% is customary?

725
00:52:32,767 --> 00:52:35,435
Pilar? Hey, it's Tommy.

726
00:52:35,603 --> 00:52:37,729
Tommy?

727
00:52:43,486 --> 00:52:45,612
Okay. Sorry.

728
00:52:46,573 --> 00:52:50,075
Good. I'm good. How
are you doing?

729
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:54,329
Okay. You know me, Tommy.

730
00:52:54,414 --> 00:52:56,832
I was getting really
worried about you.

731
00:52:57,917 --> 00:53:01,253
How's things? How are the kids?
The kids good?

732
00:53:01,337 --> 00:53:02,588
Yeah, they're good.

733
00:53:03,089 --> 00:53:05,632
- Maria's getting so big.
- Yeah?

734
00:53:06,634 --> 00:53:09,428
She looks more and more
like Manny every day.

735
00:53:10,513 --> 00:53:14,933
- How's little man?
- He's good. He's a good kid, Tommy.

736
00:53:15,018 --> 00:53:18,812
He's a real good boy. He
takes care of his sister.

737
00:53:18,897 --> 00:53:21,189
- He's a great kid. Everyone's good.
- Good.

738
00:53:21,274 --> 00:53:23,108
- We're good.
- Good.

739
00:53:25,361 --> 00:53:26,778
You know...

740
00:53:27,655 --> 00:53:31,825
Pilar, I haven't
forgotten for one minute

741
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:35,037
what I promised you.

742
00:53:36,706 --> 00:53:40,500
What I promised Manny. I got
opportunities coming up, so...

743
00:53:40,585 --> 00:53:42,044
Whatever you can do, Tommy.

744
00:53:42,128 --> 00:53:44,713
Help you guys out. I'm gonna
take care of you guys.

745
00:53:44,797 --> 00:53:48,175
I know. Manny would
really appreciate it.

746
00:53:48,635 --> 00:53:50,802
- I wanna help you.
- You know what? You worry too much.

747
00:53:50,887 --> 00:53:54,056
You worry so much about us.
It's okay.

748
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:56,433
You know what? We're
hanging in there.

749
00:53:56,517 --> 00:54:00,395
"Captain Pollard once more sailed for the
Pacific in command of another ship,"

750
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:04,691
"but the gods shipwrecked him again
upon unknown rocks and breakers."

751
00:54:04,776 --> 00:54:08,028
"For the second time, his
ship was utterly lost,"

752
00:54:08,112 --> 00:54:11,448
"and forthwith forswearing the sea,
he has never tempted it since."

753
00:54:12,325 --> 00:54:15,410
Stop for a second. Listen to the music.
This is Beethoven.

754
00:54:16,788 --> 00:54:19,581
Could you do another thing? Or
are you gonna do the same thing?

755
00:54:19,666 --> 00:54:23,210
I need you to relax and listen.
Forget about how to lose the fight.

756
00:54:23,294 --> 00:54:25,337
And two, and three.

757
00:54:25,505 --> 00:54:27,047
With eight weeks left to Sparta,

758
00:54:27,131 --> 00:54:28,924
J.J. Riley and the Tapout crew

759
00:54:29,008 --> 00:54:31,927
take time out from their
international press tour to join us.

760
00:54:32,011 --> 00:54:34,680
J.J., we've never seen this
kind of Grand Prix tournament

761
00:54:34,764 --> 00:54:37,766
in this country before. Tell
us, why the unique format?

762
00:54:38,184 --> 00:54:41,770
Well, look, Jon, you know as well as
anyone that in mixed martial arts,

763
00:54:41,854 --> 00:54:44,064
anyone can beat anyone
on a given night.

764
00:54:44,148 --> 00:54:45,899
But with this type of format,

765
00:54:46,025 --> 00:54:48,610
it's gonna be tough to
deny who the champion is.

766
00:54:48,695 --> 00:54:53,657
You got four fights in two
nights, 16 fighters down to one,

767
00:54:53,741 --> 00:54:55,450
winner's gonna be the
last man standing.

768
00:54:55,535 --> 00:54:57,494
Thirty-one. Thirty-two!

769
00:54:58,955 --> 00:55:01,164
Breathe, breathe.
Keep your eyes open.

770
00:55:01,541 --> 00:55:03,959
You gotta keep moving. You gotta
keep moving. Keep moving.

771
00:55:04,043 --> 00:55:07,796
Good! And listen to the music. You breathe.
He's getting it. He's getting it.

772
00:55:07,964 --> 00:55:10,465
You see? You feel it?
Feel the music.

773
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:12,592
- Come on!
- Nice.

774
00:55:14,345 --> 00:55:15,595
Come on, baby!

775
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:19,182
With Rashad Evans and Stephan Bonnar
and just five weeks left until Sparta,

776
00:55:19,267 --> 00:55:23,270
as the hype continues for the war on
the shore this Fourth of July weekend

777
00:55:23,354 --> 00:55:25,272
in Atlantic City. You
know what that means.

778
00:55:25,356 --> 00:55:28,108
The great Koba bringing
his act stateside.

779
00:55:28,192 --> 00:55:29,985
But I gotta ask you
about the other guys.

780
00:55:30,069 --> 00:55:33,030
What are they thinking, entering
a winner-take-all tournament

781
00:55:33,114 --> 00:55:34,740
against a guy that
seemingly can't be beaten?

782
00:55:34,907 --> 00:55:37,534
They're thinking $5 million and
$5 million seems a lot of money,

783
00:55:37,618 --> 00:55:40,162
but they gotta remember one thing.
They're going against Koba.

784
00:55:40,246 --> 00:55:42,622
Mission impossible,
game over, go home.

785
00:55:42,707 --> 00:55:44,374
Well, the winner takes
home $5 million.

786
00:55:44,459 --> 00:55:47,127
You can be sure this will
dominate the sports landscape.

787
00:55:47,211 --> 00:55:49,087
Fourth of July weekend
in Atlantic City.

788
00:55:49,172 --> 00:55:53,216
The great Koba making his presence
felt in the United States.

789
00:55:53,426 --> 00:55:54,760
Two... Come on, Tommy.

790
00:55:54,844 --> 00:55:57,054
Hits you soft, right?
Flow like water.

791
00:55:57,305 --> 00:55:58,972
Get on your arm, watch
what's gonna happen.

792
00:55:59,849 --> 00:56:02,225
There it is. Look, look, look.
He's going to sleep.

793
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:04,811
You train with the best
to be the best, Brendan.

794
00:56:08,983 --> 00:56:11,860
Pittsburgh Beatdown has become
one of the most watched videos

795
00:56:11,944 --> 00:56:13,653
on YouTube this year.

796
00:56:13,738 --> 00:56:17,074
Now joining us, via satellite, is the
victim of the infamous incident,

797
00:56:17,158 --> 00:56:18,241
Mad Dog Grimes.

798
00:56:18,326 --> 00:56:22,204
Mad Dog, what is your response to all
the hoopla surrounding the video

799
00:56:22,288 --> 00:56:23,371
and Tommy Riordan?

800
00:56:23,456 --> 00:56:25,999
This guy's a nobody.
It's a sparring session.

801
00:56:26,084 --> 00:56:28,585
It is what it is, and he's
gonna pay for it next month

802
00:56:28,669 --> 00:56:31,088
in Atlantic City.

803
00:56:31,339 --> 00:56:33,423
Good. Always move. Always move.

804
00:56:33,508 --> 00:56:36,927
I don't know, Marco. You're getting a
good game here from a physics teacher.

805
00:56:37,845 --> 00:56:39,137
Good! Good.

806
00:56:39,889 --> 00:56:41,973
You see? You see? Beautiful.

807
00:56:42,058 --> 00:56:45,310
Top of the food chain. He's
the next champ, right here.

808
00:56:53,069 --> 00:56:55,487
So, with Sparta now just
two short weeks away,

809
00:56:55,571 --> 00:56:58,406
J.J. Riley and the Tapout
crew return to the US

810
00:56:58,491 --> 00:57:02,994
after a world tour that saw them visit
10 fighters in 10 different countries.

811
00:57:03,079 --> 00:57:05,705
They stopped in Philadelphia today
to check in on renowned trainer,

812
00:57:05,832 --> 00:57:06,915
Frank Campana,

813
00:57:06,999 --> 00:57:09,751
and top contender, Marco Santos.

814
00:57:09,836 --> 00:57:12,254
You gotta relax and
stay calm in there.

815
00:57:12,338 --> 00:57:14,214
The cage is your home.

816
00:57:14,298 --> 00:57:15,715
You set the pace.

817
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,467
You set the rhythm.

818
00:57:17,593 --> 00:57:19,553
Feel the Beethoven.

819
00:57:19,637 --> 00:57:23,348
Be smarter than him, more patient.
Wait for him to make a mistake.

820
00:57:24,016 --> 00:57:26,268
And when he does,
that's your moment.

821
00:57:26,352 --> 00:57:28,103
I see it. I see it. I see it.

822
00:57:29,856 --> 00:57:31,523
No, he did not tap you!

823
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,360
Physics teacher! That's the
best in the business, son.

824
00:57:37,488 --> 00:57:38,780
You can do this, Son!

825
00:57:38,865 --> 00:57:41,616
Smoother. There's more in you!
You got more in you!

826
00:57:41,701 --> 00:57:42,784
We're not done yet!

827
00:57:42,869 --> 00:57:45,704
He's beating you!
He's beating you!

828
00:57:45,788 --> 00:57:48,748
You better push harder, Marco!
Brendan's running away!

829
00:57:52,336 --> 00:57:54,796
And the winner by tap out

830
00:57:54,881 --> 00:57:57,716
"Irish" Brendan Conlon.

831
00:58:02,889 --> 00:58:07,309
"...to each and every man in turn but
mirrors back his own mysterious self."

832
00:58:07,393 --> 00:58:12,397
"Great pains, small gains for those
who ask the world to solve them."

833
00:58:12,481 --> 00:58:15,025
"It cannot solve itself."

834
00:58:32,585 --> 00:58:34,419
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

835
00:58:34,503 --> 00:58:36,838
- You wanna grab a bite?
- No. I'm gonna head home.

836
00:58:36,923 --> 00:58:39,674
I gotta call the boys
and break the news.

837
00:58:40,927 --> 00:58:43,428
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- Okay.

838
00:58:52,188 --> 00:58:53,688
Coach!

839
00:58:57,610 --> 00:59:01,571
Hey, I know this is not
a really great time,

840
00:59:01,656 --> 00:59:04,824
and it's too bad about Marco.

841
00:59:07,787 --> 00:59:09,246
But how about me?

842
00:59:10,873 --> 00:59:11,873
Are you talking about Sparta?

843
00:59:12,625 --> 00:59:14,542
Yeah.

844
00:59:14,627 --> 00:59:16,211
Brendan, you've got a better
shot at starting a boy band.

845
00:59:16,295 --> 00:59:17,295
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

846
00:59:27,515 --> 00:59:29,182
It's a Grand Prix tournament.

847
00:59:31,394 --> 00:59:34,020
Which means anything could happen.
You know that as well as I do.

848
00:59:34,105 --> 00:59:35,605
Yeah.

849
00:59:37,483 --> 00:59:39,442
Come on. They'd have to kill
me to get me out of the cage.

850
00:59:40,361 --> 00:59:42,362
That's what I'm afraid of.

851
00:59:42,446 --> 00:59:43,947
Frank, I need this.

852
00:59:44,657 --> 00:59:47,993
You're real tight with these guys.
You could call them.

853
00:59:48,995 --> 00:59:51,913
You're the guy. They trust you.

854
00:59:55,167 --> 00:59:57,919
Brendan.

855
00:59:58,004 --> 00:59:59,963
You realize what you're
asking me to do here?

856
01:00:00,047 --> 01:00:01,548
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

857
01:00:01,674 --> 01:00:04,759
We go down to AC, you get
tapped out in five seconds.

858
01:00:04,844 --> 01:00:06,636
How does that benefit
either one of us?

859
01:00:06,721 --> 01:00:09,931
- It's not gonna happen.
- Not gonna happen?

860
01:00:10,016 --> 01:00:11,975
Wish I had a nickel for every
time somebody told me that.

861
01:00:12,601 --> 01:00:14,269
It's not gonna happen.

862
01:00:29,702 --> 01:00:31,202
I'll make a call.

863
01:00:38,502 --> 01:00:41,338
I love my coach!

864
01:00:50,181 --> 01:00:53,183
Yeah, they're good. The girls are good.
They're good.

865
01:00:54,268 --> 01:00:55,352
Yeah, he should.

866
01:00:55,436 --> 01:00:57,979
I mean, you've been spending so
much time with Brendan these days,

867
01:00:58,064 --> 01:01:01,107
it's like you're part of
the family or something.

868
01:01:03,277 --> 01:01:06,821
Yeah, he's right here.
It's your boyfriend.

869
01:01:08,449 --> 01:01:10,492
Frank. Hey, man.

870
01:01:17,458 --> 01:01:19,834
That's unbelievable.

871
01:01:21,003 --> 01:01:24,923
Wow! Wow, Frank, I can't thank you enough.
I don't know what to say.

872
01:01:26,717 --> 01:01:29,677
All right, listen, I gotta
call you back, okay?

873
01:01:35,267 --> 01:01:37,560
All right. Bye.

874
01:01:38,813 --> 01:01:40,438
I'm in.

875
01:01:41,565 --> 01:01:43,817
- I'm going.
- Really?

876
01:01:44,944 --> 01:01:48,446
That's your decision?
You decided?

877
01:01:50,533 --> 01:01:52,700
'Cause I really enjoyed the
conversation we just had

878
01:01:52,785 --> 01:01:55,787
about making that
decision together.

879
01:01:59,667 --> 01:02:04,254
You told me you were gonna fight
guys that watched too much UFC.

880
01:02:04,338 --> 01:02:06,548
I saw the Koba dude
on the television,

881
01:02:06,632 --> 01:02:08,550
and he's the guy
they're watching.

882
01:02:08,634 --> 01:02:09,592
It's a lot of money, Tess.

883
01:02:09,677 --> 01:02:12,178
I don't give a shit about the
money, Brendan. I told you that.

884
01:02:13,431 --> 01:02:15,432
We're gonna end up cashing in
your life insurance policy

885
01:02:15,516 --> 01:02:16,975
before we pick up
that prize money.

886
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:19,894
You don't think I
can do it, right?

887
01:02:20,146 --> 01:02:21,980
I think you could get killed.

888
01:02:26,277 --> 01:02:28,069
- I'm not gonna get killed.
- You're not gonna get killed,

889
01:02:28,154 --> 01:02:29,571
but you promised me you're
not gonna get hurt.

890
01:02:29,655 --> 01:02:32,240
You're not gonna end up in the hospital.
You're not gonna end up paralyzed.

891
01:02:32,324 --> 01:02:34,868
We have no prize money,
we have no house.

892
01:02:34,952 --> 01:02:37,996
- We have payments for hospital bills.
- Tess! Listen, I'll promise you this.

893
01:02:39,498 --> 01:02:42,584
If I don't try in three weeks,
they're gonna take the house.

894
01:02:44,128 --> 01:02:46,212
How's that for a promise?

895
01:02:50,259 --> 01:02:53,094
So, I'm gonna go, okay?

896
01:02:53,179 --> 01:02:56,431
But I'd really love it if
you'd be with me on this.

897
01:03:03,481 --> 01:03:05,940
I'm not gonna watch you
fight again, I'm not.

898
01:03:06,025 --> 01:03:08,443
I'm gonna get the
girls breakfast.

899
01:03:38,307 --> 01:03:41,809
Fourth of July weekend doesn't
officially get started until tomorrow,

900
01:03:41,894 --> 01:03:44,354
but fight fans are already
descending on Atlantic City

901
01:03:44,438 --> 01:03:48,274
for the Super Bowl of mixed
martial arts, Sparta!

902
01:03:48,359 --> 01:03:51,152
We've got the dancing girls,
we've got the paparazzi,

903
01:03:51,237 --> 01:03:52,654
we've got the red carpet!

904
01:03:52,738 --> 01:03:56,241
And here comes J.J. Riley,
the man who started it all.

905
01:03:56,325 --> 01:03:59,160
J.J., you've made a fortune
with your hedge funds.

906
01:03:59,411 --> 01:04:00,954
You turned your
back on Wall Street

907
01:04:01,038 --> 01:04:03,373
and dedicated your life
to making Sparta happen.

908
01:04:03,457 --> 01:04:06,709
Tell us why this tournament
is so important to you?

909
01:04:06,877 --> 01:04:07,919
Growing up, we all
wanted to know

910
01:04:08,003 --> 01:04:10,213
who the toughest kid in the
neighborhood was, right?

911
01:04:10,297 --> 01:04:12,131
I wanna know who the toughest
man on the planet is.

912
01:04:12,216 --> 01:04:13,925
And that's why I put
this thing together.

913
01:04:14,009 --> 01:04:16,803
That's what all these people are
here to see, come Saturday night.

914
01:04:16,887 --> 01:04:19,222
- That's what we're gonna find out.
- Thank you, J.J.

915
01:04:19,306 --> 01:04:24,018
And here's something fans never
thought they'd see. Koba is here.

916
01:04:24,103 --> 01:04:27,522
The legend arriving to fight on
US soil for the very first time.

917
01:04:27,606 --> 01:04:28,606
- Koba! Koba!
- Koba! Koba!

918
01:04:28,691 --> 01:04:31,651
Olympic gold medalist in
wrestling, world Sambo champion,

919
01:04:31,735 --> 01:04:34,529
undefeated in his mixed
martial arts career.

920
01:04:34,613 --> 01:04:37,699
Nobody's survived a round with
the Russian in five years.

921
01:04:37,783 --> 01:04:40,285
He is the greatest fighter...

922
01:04:51,171 --> 01:04:53,089
I mean, you've seen our logos.

923
01:04:53,173 --> 01:04:55,425
No, yeah, I've seen your stuff.
It looks good.

924
01:04:55,593 --> 01:04:57,051
I mean, is he fighting
after Sparta?

925
01:04:57,136 --> 01:04:59,220
I mean, we're trying to
find some info on him.

926
01:04:59,305 --> 01:05:00,805
No, I'm not sure.

927
01:05:32,338 --> 01:05:34,881
Hey, where'd you go?
Where'd you go?

928
01:05:34,965 --> 01:05:37,675
You can't leave me like that.
They want to talk to you, not me.

929
01:05:37,885 --> 01:05:38,885
- Frank Campana?
- Yeah.

930
01:05:38,969 --> 01:05:40,678
Hi. Julia, J.J.
Riley's assistant.

931
01:05:40,763 --> 01:05:42,555
- Julia, how are you?
- Brendan Conlon?

932
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,474
- Yeah, hi. Hey.
- Hi. Julia, J.J. Riley's assistant.

933
01:05:44,558 --> 01:05:45,767
- Right, hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

934
01:05:45,851 --> 01:05:47,060
A few things I want
to let you guys know.

935
01:05:47,144 --> 01:05:50,063
- Press conference will start in 20 minutes.
- Okay.

936
01:05:50,147 --> 01:05:52,315
Brendan, you're gonna be
sitting up on the stage.

937
01:05:52,399 --> 01:05:53,691
Tommy!

938
01:05:53,942 --> 01:05:55,902
Hey, Tommy! Where you going?

939
01:05:56,153 --> 01:05:57,904
Can we stand with J.J.?

940
01:05:58,072 --> 01:06:00,573
"Hearing the tremendous rush
of the sea-crashing boat,

941
01:06:00,658 --> 01:06:04,619
"the whale wheeled round to present
his blank forehead at bay.

942
01:06:04,703 --> 01:06:08,956
"But in that evolution, catching sight
of the nearing black hull of the ship,

943
01:06:09,041 --> 01:06:12,794
"seemingly seeing in it the
source of all his persecutions,

944
01:06:12,878 --> 01:06:17,006
"bethinking it, it may be
a larger and nobler foe.

945
01:06:17,091 --> 01:06:20,718
"Of a sudden, he bore down
upon its advancing prow,

946
01:06:20,803 --> 01:06:24,722
"smiting his jaws amid
fiery showers of foam.

947
01:06:25,432 --> 01:06:28,267
"Ahab staggered, his
hand smote his forehead.

948
01:06:28,352 --> 01:06:30,103
"I grow blind...".

949
01:06:30,187 --> 01:06:31,938
Now, the only person
missing from the event

950
01:06:32,022 --> 01:06:34,524
was dark horse entry,
Tommy Riordan.

951
01:06:34,608 --> 01:06:38,528
Recent revelations that Riordan was
not only a United States Marine,

952
01:06:38,612 --> 01:06:42,490
but a hero in the Iraq War, has
cast an even wider spotlight

953
01:06:42,574 --> 01:06:45,159
on a fighter who seems to
have come out of nowhere.

954
01:06:45,244 --> 01:06:48,329
Lance Corporal Mark Bradford's
Web testimony to Riordan,

955
01:06:48,414 --> 01:06:50,873
who saved his life earlier
this year in Iraq,

956
01:06:50,958 --> 01:06:53,918
is now spreading like wildfire
throughout the media.

957
01:06:54,002 --> 01:06:55,128
Tommy!

958
01:06:55,212 --> 01:06:56,713
And the bridge just crumbled.

959
01:06:56,797 --> 01:06:59,549
Tommy, come here. Come on.
You got to see this.

960
01:06:59,633 --> 01:07:04,387
The amtrac was upside down and water
was coming in from everywhere.

961
01:07:05,723 --> 01:07:08,516
And the water pressure was too much.
We couldn't get the back hatch open.

962
01:07:09,309 --> 01:07:10,768
We were all drowning, man.

963
01:07:11,478 --> 01:07:13,396
It was a death trap.

964
01:07:13,689 --> 01:07:15,231
I couldn't have had more
than another minute.

965
01:07:16,358 --> 01:07:19,277
Then suddenly, the back
ramp gets ripped off.

966
01:07:20,362 --> 01:07:22,029
There he was.

967
01:07:24,950 --> 01:07:26,993
And before I could get out
and thank him, he was gone.

968
01:07:27,619 --> 01:07:29,954
- He just vanished like a ghost.
- Tommy?

969
01:07:30,038 --> 01:07:33,291
- Tommy, did you... Where you going?
- Taking a walk.

970
01:07:34,793 --> 01:07:35,835
Tommy!

971
01:07:36,170 --> 01:07:39,130
I really just wanted
to say thank you.

972
01:07:40,299 --> 01:07:42,425
You saved my life, brother.

973
01:07:43,761 --> 01:07:47,930
And anyone seeing this at Sparta,
anybody out in Pittsburgh,

974
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:51,893
you reach out to Tommy Riordan and
tell him Mark said, "Thank you."

975
01:07:51,977 --> 01:07:54,896
Footage taken from a helmet
cam on the ground in Iraq

976
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:57,356
captured the heroic incident.

977
01:07:57,441 --> 01:07:58,733
Hello?

978
01:07:59,193 --> 01:08:00,318
Brendan?

979
01:08:41,610 --> 01:08:43,820
Been looking all over for you.

980
01:08:45,948 --> 01:08:48,407
How's it going?

981
01:08:48,492 --> 01:08:50,201
It's going.

982
01:08:52,621 --> 01:08:55,456
I was thinking we should
go grab a coffee.

983
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,877
I don't drink coffee, man.
What do you want?

984
01:09:02,297 --> 01:09:03,422
You don't wanna go
sit down somewhere?

985
01:09:06,885 --> 01:09:08,135
I'm good right here.

986
01:09:10,138 --> 01:09:11,347
Okay.

987
01:09:16,812 --> 01:09:20,898
Shit, Tommy, how was I supposed to know
I was never gonna see you guys again?

988
01:09:20,983 --> 01:09:22,358
Yeah, well, you were briefed.

989
01:09:24,236 --> 01:09:25,695
You had the information.

990
01:09:28,282 --> 01:09:30,908
You chose the old
man and the girl.

991
01:09:30,993 --> 01:09:33,035
She wasn't just some girl.

992
01:09:35,622 --> 01:09:37,415
I married her.

993
01:09:39,751 --> 01:09:42,253
She's my wife.

994
01:09:42,337 --> 01:09:44,505
See?

995
01:09:44,590 --> 01:09:47,008
That's Tess.

996
01:09:47,092 --> 01:09:49,468
That's Emily and Rosie.

997
01:09:49,553 --> 01:09:51,679
They're your nieces, Tommy.

998
01:09:51,763 --> 01:09:53,389
I don't know them.

999
01:09:53,473 --> 01:09:57,310
I know you don't know them. Of
course you don't know them.

1000
01:09:57,603 --> 01:10:00,938
So why am I looking at pictures
of people I don't know?

1001
01:10:02,065 --> 01:10:04,025
'Cause that's my family.

1002
01:10:06,278 --> 01:10:08,029
And who are you exactly?

1003
01:10:13,118 --> 01:10:14,452
I'm your brother, man.

1004
01:10:17,789 --> 01:10:19,165
You were in the Corps?

1005
01:10:19,625 --> 01:10:21,125
What?

1006
01:10:21,209 --> 01:10:24,462
- I said I didn't know you were in the Corps.
- I wasn't in the Corps.

1007
01:10:25,672 --> 01:10:27,882
Then you ain't no brother to me.

1008
01:10:29,134 --> 01:10:30,468
My brother was in the Corps.

1009
01:10:31,136 --> 01:10:32,720
Jesus, Tommy. Tommy.

1010
01:10:32,846 --> 01:10:36,265
I was a 16-year-old kid.
What the hell did I know?

1011
01:10:36,683 --> 01:10:37,767
I don't know what you know.

1012
01:10:37,851 --> 01:10:39,477
Why don't you go ask your
girlfriend about it?

1013
01:10:39,561 --> 01:10:41,145
She's my wife, Tommy.

1014
01:10:41,271 --> 01:10:44,523
So, that's it? I stay with Tess, I
never get to see you guys again?

1015
01:10:44,608 --> 01:10:46,984
Not a single phone call?
Nothing?

1016
01:10:48,612 --> 01:10:50,988
God, man, I don't
understand this.

1017
01:10:51,740 --> 01:10:53,157
What? You...

1018
01:10:53,241 --> 01:10:56,911
So, you won't forgive me,
but you forgave Pop?

1019
01:10:58,997 --> 01:11:03,250
No, he's just some old vet that I train
with, you know? He means nothing to me.

1020
01:11:04,836 --> 01:11:07,672
And what I hear, he means
nothing to you, either.

1021
01:11:09,174 --> 01:11:12,385
You got balls talking
about forgiveness.

1022
01:11:12,469 --> 01:11:14,220
That has nothing to
do with forgiveness.

1023
01:11:14,304 --> 01:11:17,098
I got children, man. I
got a family to protect.

1024
01:11:17,182 --> 01:11:19,183
Everything I do is for them.

1025
01:11:19,685 --> 01:11:21,727
I forgave Pop.

1026
01:11:21,812 --> 01:11:23,646
Just like I forgave you and Mom.

1027
01:11:31,029 --> 01:11:32,530
You forgave us?

1028
01:11:34,449 --> 01:11:35,741
Yeah.

1029
01:11:36,743 --> 01:11:38,828
Well, I'm not surprised you
made the tournament, Brendan.

1030
01:11:38,912 --> 01:11:40,997
You got some stones, man.

1031
01:11:41,081 --> 01:11:43,666
I fell in love. What the
hell was I supposed to do?

1032
01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:46,460
You were supposed to stick to the plan.
You were supposed to come with us.

1033
01:11:46,545 --> 01:11:50,047
Mom needed you, I needed you. You're
my big brother. You bailed on me.

1034
01:11:51,883 --> 01:11:53,968
Hey, you know, I'm glad you stayed.
Everything worked out for you.

1035
01:11:54,052 --> 01:11:55,094
God.

1036
01:11:55,178 --> 01:11:58,806
You leave, you get the opposite.
Okay?

1037
01:11:58,890 --> 01:12:01,559
You leave, you get
to bury people.

1038
01:12:01,643 --> 01:12:04,562
You're not the only one
that suffered, Tommy.

1039
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:08,774
I didn't even know she was sick.

1040
01:12:10,318 --> 01:12:13,904
I never even got the chance to
say goodbye to my own mother.

1041
01:12:16,908 --> 01:12:20,453
You had no right to keep that from me.
That was not your decision to make!

1042
01:12:22,622 --> 01:12:24,915
You know what?

1043
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,419
You walk around with your
pictures of your wife,

1044
01:12:28,503 --> 01:12:30,796
and you're all, "I forgive you."

1045
01:12:31,923 --> 01:12:33,424
"I forgive Pop."

1046
01:12:34,509 --> 01:12:35,676
"I forgive everyone."

1047
01:12:35,761 --> 01:12:37,261
Brendan, you know,

1048
01:12:38,972 --> 01:12:40,765
you're full of shit.

1049
01:12:46,938 --> 01:12:49,565
Are we done, Brendan?
Are we finished?

1050
01:13:09,628 --> 01:13:12,088
You realize you're supposed
to seek my wise counsel

1051
01:13:12,172 --> 01:13:14,298
while school's actually
in session, right?

1052
01:13:14,382 --> 01:13:16,300
- Yes, Principal Z.
- Tell him.

1053
01:13:16,384 --> 01:13:18,677
Okay, we wanna use the
auditorium this weekend

1054
01:13:18,762 --> 01:13:20,721
to watch Mr. C in Sparta.

1055
01:13:20,806 --> 01:13:22,473
What do you say?

1056
01:13:22,557 --> 01:13:24,225
So, you want to use
the auditorium

1057
01:13:24,309 --> 01:13:27,937
to watch a suspended teacher engage in
the activity that he was suspended for?

1058
01:13:28,021 --> 01:13:29,271
- Right.
- Am I hearing this correct?

1059
01:13:29,356 --> 01:13:31,232
Right. Okay, we thought
you would say that,

1060
01:13:31,316 --> 01:13:33,150
so it could turn into a
fundraiser, you know?

1061
01:13:33,235 --> 01:13:35,277
You know, I think you need
to talk to your parents,

1062
01:13:35,362 --> 01:13:37,488
because you guys might need
to be in summer school.

1063
01:13:37,572 --> 01:13:38,989
- Everybody wants this.
- Come on, Mr. Zito.

1064
01:13:39,074 --> 01:13:40,574
We've been telling everybody
about it already.

1065
01:13:40,659 --> 01:13:41,659
- Exactly.
- And the gym's the only place

1066
01:13:41,743 --> 01:13:44,036
- that's big enough to fit everyone.
- Look, it's never gonna happen.

1067
01:13:44,121 --> 01:13:46,622
- What if we get a petition signed?
- We'll get the whole school to sign it.

1068
01:13:46,706 --> 01:13:48,582
- The power of democracy.
- What are they gonna do about that?

1069
01:13:48,667 --> 01:13:49,625
Mr. Z, please?

1070
01:13:49,709 --> 01:13:52,753
Look, look, you guys. I appreciate the fact
that you love your teacher, I really do,

1071
01:13:52,838 --> 01:13:55,881
but there is nothing
I can do for you.

1072
01:14:29,791 --> 01:14:33,502
The roof is about to blow clean
off Boardwalk Hall Arena.

1073
01:14:33,587 --> 01:14:38,507
It might be Fourth of July weekend, but
this is Christmas Eve for fight fans.

1074
01:14:38,592 --> 01:14:42,803
This is Atlantic City. This
is the War on the Shore,

1075
01:14:42,888 --> 01:14:45,806
and this is what everyone's
been waiting for.

1076
01:14:45,891 --> 01:14:50,728
Sixteen of the baddest men on the planet
duking it out over a 24-hour period

1077
01:14:50,812 --> 01:14:54,231
for the largest purse in
mixed martial arts history.

1078
01:14:54,316 --> 01:14:57,318
In the town everyone knows
from the game of Monopoly,

1079
01:14:57,402 --> 01:15:00,446
we got ourselves a
winner-take-all affair.

1080
01:15:00,530 --> 01:15:05,826
Buckle your seatbelts, roll the dice,
and take a ride on the Reading.

1081
01:15:05,911 --> 01:15:09,038
Sparta is here!

1082
01:15:09,289 --> 01:15:11,123
Welcome, I'm Bryan Callen,

1083
01:15:11,208 --> 01:15:13,959
along with bestselling fight
author, Sam Sheridan.

1084
01:15:14,085 --> 01:15:17,129
Sam, when J.J. Riley
conceived Sparta,

1085
01:15:17,214 --> 01:15:19,089
he wanted to create,
quite simply,

1086
01:15:19,174 --> 01:15:23,093
the biggest mixed martial
arts spectacle in history.

1087
01:15:23,345 --> 01:15:26,388
$5 million, Bryan. $5 million.

1088
01:15:26,473 --> 01:15:28,891
J.J. Riley put his money
where his mouth is

1089
01:15:28,975 --> 01:15:32,394
and put up the biggest purse
the sport has ever seen.

1090
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:34,271
It's unprecedented, Sam.

1091
01:15:34,356 --> 01:15:38,692
As is the hoopla surrounding one
Tommy Riordan, the war hero,

1092
01:15:38,777 --> 01:15:41,195
who has become an
overnight sensation

1093
01:15:41,279 --> 01:15:43,280
and captured the imagination
and attention...

1094
01:15:46,785 --> 01:15:49,119
Jujitsu black belt
Francisco Barbosa,

1095
01:15:49,204 --> 01:15:52,456
who has a 19 to four record in
his mixed martial arts' career.

1096
01:15:52,958 --> 01:15:55,292
Our rules of the cage are
brought to you by Tapout.

1097
01:15:58,296 --> 01:16:01,006
- Five minutes, Paddy.
- Okay.

1098
01:16:03,051 --> 01:16:06,637
It looks as though the
moment of truth has arrived,

1099
01:16:06,721 --> 01:16:09,431
- because here comes Tommy Riordan.
- Wow!

1100
01:16:09,516 --> 01:16:11,725
Tommy Riordan's captured
the media's attention,

1101
01:16:11,810 --> 01:16:13,769
but the question still remains.

1102
01:16:13,979 --> 01:16:15,229
Who is this guy?

1103
01:16:15,313 --> 01:16:16,772
And more importantly,

1104
01:16:16,856 --> 01:16:19,775
can he compete in this talent pool?
Can he win?

1105
01:16:19,859 --> 01:16:21,610
I wish I knew. I wish
I knew who he was.

1106
01:16:21,695 --> 01:16:25,406
And I say the fact that I
don't know is very strange.

1107
01:16:25,490 --> 01:16:27,658
In an Internet age where
there are no secrets,

1108
01:16:27,742 --> 01:16:29,618
this guy's a complete mystery.

1109
01:16:29,703 --> 01:16:31,662
I can't find out
anything about him.

1110
01:16:31,830 --> 01:16:34,832
Tommy Riordan is
officially Google-proof.

1111
01:16:37,627 --> 01:16:39,503
Get your hands off me.

1112
01:16:40,797 --> 01:16:41,839
Okay, let's go.

1113
01:16:41,923 --> 01:16:43,215
You gotta love this guy, Sam.

1114
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:46,176
No walk-out music, no
sponsors, no interviews.

1115
01:16:46,303 --> 01:16:48,137
He skipped the press conference,

1116
01:16:48,221 --> 01:16:50,597
wouldn't have his picture
taken for the program.

1117
01:16:50,682 --> 01:16:52,433
He's breaking every rule.

1118
01:16:53,143 --> 01:16:55,769
The only reason, really, that Tommy
Riordan is in this tournament

1119
01:16:55,854 --> 01:17:00,357
is an MMA video making the rounds of him
beating up Mad Dog Grimes in the gym.

1120
01:17:00,442 --> 01:17:03,152
But the reason that a lot of
his fans are in the stands

1121
01:17:03,236 --> 01:17:04,820
is because of another video.

1122
01:17:04,904 --> 01:17:07,573
It's even more stunning than
the Mad Dog Grimes video.

1123
01:17:07,657 --> 01:17:09,408
This guy... Let me
describe it to you, folks,

1124
01:17:09,534 --> 01:17:11,785
for the few that haven't seen it, and
I don't know anybody who hasn't,

1125
01:17:11,870 --> 01:17:15,414
but Tommy Riordan ripped
the door off a tank

1126
01:17:15,498 --> 01:17:18,459
in the heat of battle,
saving lives in the process,

1127
01:17:18,543 --> 01:17:20,502
and then walked away
without claiming a medal.

1128
01:17:20,587 --> 01:17:21,920
- Listen...
- He ripped the door off a tank.

1129
01:17:22,005 --> 01:17:23,881
Tommy Riordan is a
genuine war hero.

1130
01:17:23,965 --> 01:17:27,301
I'm not taking anything away from the
guy, he's a very, very tough guy,

1131
01:17:27,385 --> 01:17:30,054
- but the tank don't hit back, you know.
- Sam...

1132
01:17:30,138 --> 01:17:32,556
We've seen YouTube sensations
fail on a big stage before.

1133
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:35,100
Sam, he ripped the
door off a tank!

1134
01:17:38,438 --> 01:17:40,689
Tommy Riordan, he has
definitely got his hands full

1135
01:17:40,774 --> 01:17:43,275
in his first opponent,
Francisco Barbosa.

1136
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:44,818
- Francisco Barbosa...
- He's nothing to scoff at.

1137
01:17:44,903 --> 01:17:46,612
Yeah, he's the octopus.
He's the real deal.

1138
01:17:47,739 --> 01:17:50,866
He's a very, very tough guy,
a very high-caliber fighter.

1139
01:17:50,950 --> 01:17:52,618
Now, Tommy Riordan
came out of nowhere,

1140
01:17:52,702 --> 01:17:55,079
and I'd imagine he's gonna
disappear just as quickly.

1141
01:17:55,163 --> 01:17:56,163
It's a great story,

1142
01:17:56,247 --> 01:17:59,291
but I think your boy is
gonna be exposed here

1143
01:17:59,417 --> 01:18:00,834
- as a YouTube sensation.
- Well, well,

1144
01:18:00,919 --> 01:18:04,046
a lot of fans here in Boardwalk
Hall hope you're wrong, Sam.

1145
01:18:04,589 --> 01:18:06,298
All right, gentlemen, you've
been given your instructions.

1146
01:18:06,383 --> 01:18:07,925
I expect a clean fight.

1147
01:18:08,009 --> 01:18:09,343
Obey my command at all times,

1148
01:18:09,427 --> 01:18:10,719
defend yourselves at all times.

1149
01:18:11,054 --> 01:18:12,596
Touch gloves, go
back, let's do this.

1150
01:18:15,183 --> 01:18:17,226
Tommy, cut off the corners,
feel this guy out,

1151
01:18:17,310 --> 01:18:18,769
just like we know.
Just like we know.

1152
01:18:18,853 --> 01:18:21,730
We're about to get the big
answer to the big question.

1153
01:18:21,815 --> 01:18:24,024
Is Tommy Riordan for real?

1154
01:18:24,109 --> 01:18:26,318
- Gentlemen, you ready?
- They are both game fighters.

1155
01:18:26,403 --> 01:18:28,153
- And here we go.
- You ready?

1156
01:18:28,279 --> 01:18:29,363
Let's go to war!

1157
01:18:29,447 --> 01:18:31,031
Keep your focus, Tom.

1158
01:18:31,116 --> 01:18:32,866
And here we go. We're
gonna see this.

1159
01:18:32,951 --> 01:18:34,326
Barbosa's gonna be
looking for a takedown.

1160
01:18:34,411 --> 01:18:36,453
He's definitely looking
for a takedown here.

1161
01:18:41,084 --> 01:18:44,294
Barbosa is down! Barbosa
has been knocked out!

1162
01:18:44,379 --> 01:18:47,548
Tommy Riordan is most
definitely for real.

1163
01:18:47,632 --> 01:18:51,218
And now he's walking out of the cage.
He's leaving the cage.

1164
01:18:51,302 --> 01:18:52,845
Hey, Tommy!

1165
01:18:52,929 --> 01:18:55,013
There goes another
rule, out the window!

1166
01:18:55,807 --> 01:18:57,141
Where you going?

1167
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:00,269
Francisco Barbosa is out cold,

1168
01:19:00,353 --> 01:19:03,021
and he is out of this
tournament, Bryan.

1169
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:05,941
- A huge left hook, launching...
- Good. Nice and easy. Nice and easy.

1170
01:19:06,025 --> 01:19:08,902
- ...Tommy Riordan into the second round.
- One, two. Good, good. One, two, three.

1171
01:19:08,987 --> 01:19:11,530
Good. Two, three.

1172
01:19:11,614 --> 01:19:13,282
Good. Good, good, good.

1173
01:19:13,366 --> 01:19:16,243
- Good. Come on. Good. One, two.
- Tommy Riordan is the real deal.

1174
01:19:17,829 --> 01:19:20,414
- Showtime.
- All right. Come on, give me eight.

1175
01:19:22,917 --> 01:19:25,085
Yes! That's my boy.

1176
01:20:08,046 --> 01:20:09,713
Let's go, move your head around.

1177
01:20:16,137 --> 01:20:17,679
You ready?

1178
01:20:21,518 --> 01:20:22,893
Look at me.

1179
01:20:27,190 --> 01:20:28,482
You can do this.

1180
01:20:35,073 --> 01:20:36,865
I wanna hear you say it.

1181
01:20:42,330 --> 01:20:43,497
I can do this.

1182
01:20:44,374 --> 01:20:45,999
Let's go do this.

1183
01:20:47,710 --> 01:20:49,310
Yeah.

1184
01:21:02,850 --> 01:21:06,937
J.J. Riley only had 48 hours, less
than 48 hours, to fill the spot.

1185
01:21:07,021 --> 01:21:09,898
And basically, he had to go
on the road to Frank Campana.

1186
01:21:09,983 --> 01:21:12,067
Well, then he chose
Brendan Conlon,

1187
01:21:12,151 --> 01:21:13,902
which is really something
I don't understand.

1188
01:21:13,987 --> 01:21:15,946
I just... I'm shocked.

1189
01:21:20,785 --> 01:21:23,078
Hey, Brendan.
Brendan, go get him.

1190
01:21:26,207 --> 01:21:27,457
Go. Good luck.

1191
01:21:28,543 --> 01:21:30,210
Let's go, Brendan.

1192
01:21:31,087 --> 01:21:32,921
You go get him, Son!

1193
01:21:33,006 --> 01:21:35,090
You know, I can understand
coming out to no music,

1194
01:21:35,174 --> 01:21:38,719
but why in the world would you choose
classical music as your entrance?

1195
01:21:38,803 --> 01:21:41,597
This is Beethoven. This
is Ode to Joy, Bryan.

1196
01:21:41,681 --> 01:21:43,640
My apologies, Mr.
Renaissance Man.

1197
01:21:45,184 --> 01:21:46,852
Go get him, Son.

1198
01:21:46,936 --> 01:21:50,522
If you wanna talk about Renaissance men,
you gotta talk about Frank Campana.

1199
01:21:50,607 --> 01:21:53,650
Very unorthodox trainer, but one
of the best trainers in the game,

1200
01:21:53,985 --> 01:21:57,988
and he's well known for using classical
music to teach his fighters to remain calm,

1201
01:21:58,072 --> 01:22:01,491
to remain patient, and to
remain composed under pressure.

1202
01:22:01,576 --> 01:22:05,203
You know, I'll tell you, classical music
is about as fitting to this setting

1203
01:22:05,288 --> 01:22:07,998
as Brendan Conlon is
to this tournament.

1204
01:22:08,166 --> 01:22:09,499
- Come on.
- In fact, let me show you something.

1205
01:22:09,584 --> 01:22:10,584
Right here. Let me tell you...

1206
01:22:10,668 --> 01:22:12,085
- What?
- You see that, right there?

1207
01:22:12,170 --> 01:22:16,006
That, right there... That, my
friend, is Brendan Conlon.

1208
01:22:16,215 --> 01:22:19,968
Okay? Brendan Conlon's about to
be dropped into a shark tank.

1209
01:22:20,053 --> 01:22:21,303
He's a feeder fish.

1210
01:22:21,387 --> 01:22:22,888
Come on, give the guy a break.

1211
01:22:22,972 --> 01:22:25,307
You know, the guy... At
least we've seen him fight.

1212
01:22:25,391 --> 01:22:27,851
I mean, he's fought real guys.
He's been in the UFC.

1213
01:22:27,935 --> 01:22:29,895
- We remember him from that.
- I remember him, too.

1214
01:22:29,979 --> 01:22:32,022
I remember him being
very unmemorable.

1215
01:22:52,126 --> 01:22:55,337
Midnight Le getting ready to climb
into the cage and go to work.

1216
01:22:55,421 --> 01:22:56,463
When the brackets
were announced,

1217
01:22:56,547 --> 01:22:58,382
he thought he'd be going
up against Marco Santos.

1218
01:22:58,466 --> 01:23:01,426
He's got to be thrilled to be seeing
Brendan Conlon across from him.

1219
01:23:01,511 --> 01:23:03,595
Hey! You asked for it.

1220
01:23:04,389 --> 01:23:06,973
Brendan retired from
fighting some years ago.

1221
01:23:07,058 --> 01:23:09,643
He's actually a high school
physics teacher now,

1222
01:23:09,727 --> 01:23:12,646
and Midnight had some fun with that
at the press conference yesterday.

1223
01:23:12,730 --> 01:23:15,399
Well, he said he was going to give
the teacher a serious lesson,

1224
01:23:15,483 --> 01:23:18,819
and that getting killed was no
way to spend a summer vacation.

1225
01:23:18,903 --> 01:23:22,572
Midnight is known for talking trash,
he's also known for backing it up.

1226
01:23:22,657 --> 01:23:24,616
No question, Bryan. He's
in a lot of trouble here.

1227
01:23:24,701 --> 01:23:28,328
- Midnight Le is an agent of destruction.
- Gentlemen.

1228
01:23:30,957 --> 01:23:32,332
Go get him.

1229
01:23:35,545 --> 01:23:37,087
All right, guys, you've been
given your instructions.

1230
01:23:37,171 --> 01:23:38,588
I expect a clean fight.

1231
01:23:38,673 --> 01:23:42,175
Obey my commands at all times.
Defend yourselves at all times.

1232
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:44,428
Touch gloves, go
back, let's do this.

1233
01:23:45,888 --> 01:23:47,764
Go have some fun, baby.

1234
01:23:52,019 --> 01:23:53,270
Gentlemen, you ready?

1235
01:23:54,856 --> 01:23:56,940
You ready? Let's go to war!

1236
01:24:01,112 --> 01:24:04,281
Work your kicks!

1237
01:24:07,201 --> 01:24:08,827
Come on, Brendan, come on.

1238
01:24:09,162 --> 01:24:10,787
Move! You gotta move,
you gotta move.

1239
01:24:11,622 --> 01:24:13,373
Let it out! Come on, move!

1240
01:24:17,545 --> 01:24:19,254
Stay away from the legs! Circle!

1241
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:20,756
In and out!

1242
01:24:27,138 --> 01:24:28,638
Get off the fence!

1243
01:24:30,224 --> 01:24:32,142
Get through this. Sprawl down!

1244
01:24:32,852 --> 01:24:35,687
Get off the fence!
Get off the fence!

1245
01:24:37,148 --> 01:24:38,565
There he goes!

1246
01:24:38,649 --> 01:24:39,983
Come on, Brendan.
Get out of there!

1247
01:24:40,610 --> 01:24:41,902
Come on!

1248
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:43,862
Get up!

1249
01:24:45,364 --> 01:24:47,491
- Come on! Come on!
- Watch the back of the head!

1250
01:24:47,575 --> 01:24:49,743
- Relax, you're okay. You're okay!
- Midnight is all over Brendan.

1251
01:24:49,827 --> 01:24:52,329
Well, this can't last much longer.
This won't last much longer.

1252
01:24:52,413 --> 01:24:54,831
The teacher just has no answers.

1253
01:24:54,916 --> 01:24:56,917
Get out of there!
Get out of there!

1254
01:24:58,419 --> 01:25:00,712
- And now, he's got the hooks in.
- The hooks are in.

1255
01:25:00,797 --> 01:25:02,839
- Brendan in very big trouble.
- The end is close.

1256
01:25:02,965 --> 01:25:04,841
Can Brendan make the
end of the round?

1257
01:25:05,718 --> 01:25:06,760
Well, he's got the choke.

1258
01:25:06,844 --> 01:25:08,428
- He's got 20 seconds left in the round...
- Come on.

1259
01:25:08,513 --> 01:25:11,598
And Conlon's face is turning purple.
This looks like it's over.

1260
01:25:11,682 --> 01:25:13,975
Get up! Find his legs!

1261
01:25:14,060 --> 01:25:15,936
Hips! Hip down!

1262
01:25:16,020 --> 01:25:18,396
Hip down! Get your weight down!

1263
01:25:18,481 --> 01:25:19,940
Get your weight down!

1264
01:25:20,024 --> 01:25:22,484
Well, Midnight is squeezing with all
his might. He's got it very deep.

1265
01:25:22,568 --> 01:25:25,153
- Ten seconds! Don't you tap!
- Ten seconds, Bryan, 10 seconds.

1266
01:25:25,279 --> 01:25:27,405
Don't tap! Brendan,
don't you tap!

1267
01:25:27,949 --> 01:25:28,949
Hold on, Brendan.

1268
01:25:29,033 --> 01:25:30,534
Conlon doing his
best to hang on,

1269
01:25:30,618 --> 01:25:32,577
'cause his whole world's about
to go from day to night.

1270
01:25:32,662 --> 01:25:34,913
Don't you tap! Don't
you tap, Brendan!

1271
01:25:38,042 --> 01:25:40,210
I cannot believe that, Sam!

1272
01:25:40,294 --> 01:25:42,462
I thought for sure this
guy was going to sleep.

1273
01:25:45,049 --> 01:25:47,092
Midnight can't believe
it either, by the way.

1274
01:25:48,052 --> 01:25:49,594
Jesus.

1275
01:25:52,598 --> 01:25:55,016
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1276
01:25:55,101 --> 01:25:58,979
You should've had him
in the first round.

1277
01:26:00,106 --> 01:26:03,233
Beautiful. Beautiful. He
doesn't know what hit him.

1278
01:26:03,317 --> 01:26:05,151
He doesn't know what hit him.
Breathe.

1279
01:26:05,736 --> 01:26:06,903
Deep breaths. Come on now.

1280
01:26:07,196 --> 01:26:09,364
Small sip, small sip. Small sip.

1281
01:26:09,448 --> 01:26:11,783
Deep breath, deep breath. I
want you to do something.

1282
01:26:12,910 --> 01:26:14,578
I want you to get
him to pull, okay?

1283
01:26:14,662 --> 01:26:17,414
When he pulls, I want you to hit him a
bit and I want you to shoot on him.

1284
01:26:17,498 --> 01:26:20,584
I'd love to be a fly on the wall,
listening to Frank Campana right now

1285
01:26:20,668 --> 01:26:21,710
and hear what he's
saying in there.

1286
01:26:21,794 --> 01:26:23,461
In and out. In and out.
In and out.

1287
01:26:23,546 --> 01:26:26,548
And I want you to trade punches with
him, all right? You're doing beautiful.

1288
01:26:27,758 --> 01:26:29,509
Let's go, seconds out!

1289
01:26:29,594 --> 01:26:30,802
Knock him out. Knock him out.
Knock him out.

1290
01:26:30,887 --> 01:26:32,012
This round, knock him out.

1291
01:26:32,096 --> 01:26:34,180
- Let's do it.
- He doesn't deserve to be here.

1292
01:26:34,265 --> 01:26:36,224
Beautiful. Breathe.

1293
01:26:36,309 --> 01:26:37,601
Let's go!

1294
01:26:40,104 --> 01:26:43,315
And here we go. The teacher
answering the bell for round two.

1295
01:26:43,399 --> 01:26:44,482
Nice and easy!

1296
01:26:45,526 --> 01:26:47,527
Set the pace! Set
the pace, Brendan!

1297
01:26:47,612 --> 01:26:49,613
Gentlemen! Let's go to war!

1298
01:27:05,463 --> 01:27:08,214
Circle around! Circle around!

1299
01:27:08,883 --> 01:27:09,925
Nice and easy!

1300
01:27:11,093 --> 01:27:12,469
Good, good!

1301
01:27:12,553 --> 01:27:14,554
Shoot! Shoot on him!

1302
01:27:16,807 --> 01:27:21,227
Get out of there! Hitch him!
Hitch him! Hitch him!

1303
01:27:22,688 --> 01:27:25,023
Get out of there! Get out of there!
Get out of there! Come on!

1304
01:27:27,318 --> 01:27:28,485
Do something.

1305
01:27:31,322 --> 01:27:32,405
Shoot! Shoot on him!

1306
01:27:33,032 --> 01:27:34,199
Shoot on him!

1307
01:27:36,953 --> 01:27:38,036
Yes!

1308
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:40,205
Conlon shoots on Midnight
Le and gets him down.

1309
01:27:40,289 --> 01:27:41,790
Midnight is trying
to get to his...

1310
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,834
- Scissors takedown.
- A beautiful scissors takedown.

1311
01:27:44,919 --> 01:27:46,795
- Really nice.
- Conlon showing signs of life

1312
01:27:46,879 --> 01:27:48,672
and not backing down.

1313
01:27:48,756 --> 01:27:49,965
Knees, knees!

1314
01:27:53,552 --> 01:27:54,594
Good!

1315
01:27:54,679 --> 01:27:56,805
Take his arm! Good!

1316
01:27:57,890 --> 01:28:00,767
- He's got a kimura lock!
- He's got a very good kimura.

1317
01:28:00,851 --> 01:28:04,187
Turn your hips in! In!

1318
01:28:04,271 --> 01:28:07,232
Up! Stay with him.
Turn your hips in!

1319
01:28:09,151 --> 01:28:11,111
Hips up! Turn your hips in!

1320
01:28:11,195 --> 01:28:12,487
Turn your hips in!

1321
01:28:12,989 --> 01:28:15,198
You got it, Brendan. Your round.
You got it!

1322
01:28:15,324 --> 01:28:17,450
Turn your hips up and in!

1323
01:28:17,785 --> 01:28:19,619
Hips up! Very good!

1324
01:28:20,204 --> 01:28:21,287
He's in a lot of trouble.

1325
01:28:21,372 --> 01:28:23,206
That's it! Come on! Come on!

1326
01:28:23,290 --> 01:28:26,251
- Wow! He's got it very, very deep.
- Midnight is in a very, very bad position.

1327
01:28:26,335 --> 01:28:27,419
Midnight is in big trouble.

1328
01:28:27,503 --> 01:28:30,463
Slow down! Relax! You got it!
You got it!

1329
01:28:30,548 --> 01:28:32,173
Brendan Conlon is going
to finish it right here!

1330
01:28:32,258 --> 01:28:34,092
Brendan Conlon has got him in a
very, very dangerous position

1331
01:28:34,176 --> 01:28:35,844
- and Midnight is in big trouble.
- Midnight...

1332
01:28:35,928 --> 01:28:37,387
I don't think Midnight
has anywhere to go.

1333
01:28:37,555 --> 01:28:39,556
You got it! You got it!

1334
01:28:39,974 --> 01:28:43,143
Slow down! Relax! You got it!
You got it!

1335
01:28:43,602 --> 01:28:46,771
And this isn't...
This isn't happening!

1336
01:28:46,856 --> 01:28:48,732
- This can't happen.
- It just did, Bryan.

1337
01:28:48,983 --> 01:28:49,983
He tapped!

1338
01:28:50,276 --> 01:28:52,110
Brendan Conlon tapped Midnight!

1339
01:28:52,194 --> 01:28:54,654
- I can't believe that.
- Oh, my goodness!

1340
01:28:54,739 --> 01:28:57,449
You got him! Way to go, Brendan!

1341
01:29:01,662 --> 01:29:03,788
Yeah! Yeah! He tapped him out.

1342
01:29:04,081 --> 01:29:05,415
Honey, he tapped him out!

1343
01:29:05,541 --> 01:29:08,626
He did it! He did it! He did it!
He did it!

1344
01:29:08,711 --> 01:29:11,337
Way to go, Brendan!
Way to go! Yeah!

1345
01:29:11,797 --> 01:29:14,215
This is what's so great
about mixed martial arts.

1346
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:16,051
There's so many ways to lose.

1347
01:29:16,135 --> 01:29:20,472
One tiny miscalculation,
anyone can win at anytime.

1348
01:29:20,556 --> 01:29:22,974
Which is probably why Frank
Campana's embracing his man.

1349
01:29:23,059 --> 01:29:27,854
And I honestly don't think either one
of them can believe what just happened.

1350
01:29:27,938 --> 01:29:30,398
Great show of sportsmanship
here from the teacher.

1351
01:29:30,483 --> 01:29:33,151
Well, that's a hallmark of
Frank Campana's philosophy,

1352
01:29:33,235 --> 01:29:34,861
something all his
fighters buy into,

1353
01:29:34,945 --> 01:29:36,905
and, obviously, none
more so than Brendan.

1354
01:29:36,989 --> 01:29:38,698
And Midnight Le is shocked.

1355
01:29:38,783 --> 01:29:40,784
He thought he'd get a free
pass into the second round,

1356
01:29:40,868 --> 01:29:42,160
but, instead, he's going home.

1357
01:29:42,244 --> 01:29:46,456
Dominated the fight the entire way, but
he falls prey to a very technical finish.

1358
01:29:46,540 --> 01:29:48,583
A very technical finish,
but that's a fluke.

1359
01:29:48,667 --> 01:29:50,627
- I don't care what anybody says. That is a...
- I don't know.

1360
01:29:50,711 --> 01:29:53,546
You can call it a fluke, but I'm gonna
call it a guy maintaining composure

1361
01:29:53,631 --> 01:29:55,465
and waiting for his opportunity.

1362
01:29:56,467 --> 01:29:59,719
Conlon beats Midnight!
Unbelievable!

1363
01:30:01,472 --> 01:30:03,348
I hope you got a receipt
for your goldfish.

1364
01:30:26,288 --> 01:30:27,455
Yes!

1365
01:30:29,333 --> 01:30:30,333
Okay.

1366
01:30:42,429 --> 01:30:44,430
We're down to eight fighters,
and soon to be seven,

1367
01:30:44,515 --> 01:30:47,308
as Koba prepares to go to work
for the second time tonight.

1368
01:30:52,815 --> 01:30:53,940
- Right hand.
- Huge right hand.

1369
01:30:54,024 --> 01:30:55,400
- Huge right hand.
- Oh, my goodness.

1370
01:30:55,734 --> 01:30:57,819
Oh, my God! This is over.

1371
01:30:57,903 --> 01:30:59,821
Once again, Koba does
not break a sweat.

1372
01:31:00,197 --> 01:31:02,782
You got to be kidding me. I'm afraid
he might have broken something else.

1373
01:31:02,867 --> 01:31:04,242
That's certainly possible.

1374
01:31:04,368 --> 01:31:06,786
Koba moving on to
tomorrow night.

1375
01:31:06,871 --> 01:31:08,872
- Koba! Koba!
- Koba! Koba!

1376
01:31:10,166 --> 01:31:12,625
Mad Dog fighting like
a man possessed.

1377
01:31:12,710 --> 01:31:14,460
Like a man with
something to prove,

1378
01:31:14,545 --> 01:31:18,548
reminding everyone why he is a serious
contender to win this whole contest.

1379
01:31:18,757 --> 01:31:22,886
He wanted to send a message to Tommy
Riordan, and there it is, right there.

1380
01:31:23,470 --> 01:31:25,638
Here comes the underdog,
Brendan Conlon.

1381
01:31:25,723 --> 01:31:28,141
The teacher miraculously
passed his first test,

1382
01:31:28,225 --> 01:31:29,726
but now he's got
to face The Dane.

1383
01:31:29,810 --> 01:31:32,353
Brendan! You can do it.

1384
01:31:35,149 --> 01:31:37,942
Halfway through round three,
now, and the beating continues.

1385
01:31:38,027 --> 01:31:42,071
I honestly don't know how Brendan Conlon
can take this kind of punishment.

1386
01:31:42,156 --> 01:31:44,073
He has been battered
without mercy

1387
01:31:44,158 --> 01:31:45,617
- in both of his fights today.
- Relax! You're okay!

1388
01:31:45,701 --> 01:31:47,368
He's still standing, Bryan.

1389
01:31:49,288 --> 01:31:50,538
Beethoven!

1390
01:31:50,623 --> 01:31:52,207
No! No, no, no!

1391
01:31:54,251 --> 01:31:55,501
Good, take him down!

1392
01:31:56,879 --> 01:31:58,504
Look at this, he's
taking The Dane down!

1393
01:31:58,589 --> 01:31:59,631
Hold on to him.

1394
01:32:00,007 --> 01:32:02,342
He's looking for that arm.
He's looking for the armbar.

1395
01:32:02,426 --> 01:32:04,260
- He's got an armbar.
- He's got that armbar.

1396
01:32:04,345 --> 01:32:06,137
He's looking to be boss
of it, once again.

1397
01:32:06,222 --> 01:32:07,764
Tap, tap, tap! Come
on, tap, tap, tap!

1398
01:32:08,682 --> 01:32:11,100
Palms flat! Palms flat!
Thumbs up!

1399
01:32:11,936 --> 01:32:13,269
He's got that arm, Sam!

1400
01:32:13,437 --> 01:32:15,855
- Break, break, break, break!
- Yes!

1401
01:32:15,940 --> 01:32:16,981
Are you kidding me?

1402
01:32:17,816 --> 01:32:18,858
Yes!

1403
01:32:18,943 --> 01:32:21,319
Do it once, it's a fluke. Do it
twice, and it's something else.

1404
01:32:21,403 --> 01:32:24,697
Pull the bandwagon over,
I think I am hopping on.

1405
01:32:25,032 --> 01:32:26,366
I think I'm a believer.

1406
01:32:26,784 --> 01:32:29,285
You did it! Way to go, Brendan!

1407
01:32:29,453 --> 01:32:30,995
- I'm doing this!
- Okay.

1408
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:32,288
- I'm doing it!
- Okay.

1409
01:32:32,373 --> 01:32:33,581
Okay, Son.

1410
01:32:34,250 --> 01:32:37,252
The crowd catching fire for
the hero Tommy Riordan.

1411
01:32:38,796 --> 01:32:40,546
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1412
01:32:40,631 --> 01:32:43,258
He doesn't seem to want anything
to do with all this adulation.

1413
01:32:43,342 --> 01:32:45,051
He's just here to fight.

1414
01:32:45,135 --> 01:32:47,595
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1415
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:49,138
Gentlemen, you ready?

1416
01:32:50,057 --> 01:32:51,224
Are you ready?

1417
01:32:51,308 --> 01:32:53,518
- Let's go to war!
- Right at him! Right at him! Right at him!

1418
01:32:54,561 --> 01:32:56,729
Well, here he comes
again like a buzz saw!

1419
01:32:59,775 --> 01:33:02,568
- Yeah.
- He is all over Diego Santana.

1420
01:33:04,947 --> 01:33:07,824
He's swarming all over him, and now
he's beating on him without mercy!

1421
01:33:07,950 --> 01:33:08,950
Oh, my goodness!

1422
01:33:17,501 --> 01:33:20,628
There he goes again,
storming out of the cage!

1423
01:33:20,713 --> 01:33:23,548
Tommy Riordan marching
off through the crowd

1424
01:33:23,632 --> 01:33:27,302
and straight into the final
four, ladies and gentlemen.

1425
01:33:27,386 --> 01:33:30,013
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1426
01:33:56,707 --> 01:33:58,916
- So where is he?
- Yeah. Mr. Conlon.

1427
01:33:59,626 --> 01:34:01,252
Make a right at
that white sign...

1428
01:34:10,763 --> 01:34:13,556
Hey! Can't sleep, huh?

1429
01:34:20,689 --> 01:34:24,067
I know that that other thing is

1430
01:34:26,528 --> 01:34:29,113
bothering the hell out of you.

1431
01:34:30,532 --> 01:34:32,700
I'm proud of you, Tommy.

1432
01:34:33,619 --> 01:34:36,287
What you did for that
kid in the tank,

1433
01:34:37,039 --> 01:34:39,082
that was really something.

1434
01:34:42,211 --> 01:34:44,337
How about deserting my unit?

1435
01:34:45,881 --> 01:34:48,091
Is that really something, too?

1436
01:34:51,220 --> 01:34:52,470
Yeah.

1437
01:34:53,263 --> 01:34:57,266
I was on my way out of the country
when I came across those guys.

1438
01:34:58,102 --> 01:34:59,894
What was I supposed to do?
Let them drown?

1439
01:34:59,978 --> 01:35:01,104
No.

1440
01:35:04,316 --> 01:35:06,692
- What did you do?
- What did I do?

1441
01:35:09,446 --> 01:35:10,905
I took off.

1442
01:35:14,451 --> 01:35:16,661
That's why you go by Riordan.

1443
01:35:17,996 --> 01:35:21,124
That's why they can't find
your service records.

1444
01:35:24,420 --> 01:35:27,213
What the hell happened
over there, Tommy?

1445
01:35:28,424 --> 01:35:30,258
That is none of
your business, man.

1446
01:35:30,342 --> 01:35:33,177
Come on, kiddo. You
know, I've been there.

1447
01:35:33,262 --> 01:35:35,721
I've done it, I've seen it.

1448
01:35:35,806 --> 01:35:37,390
You can trust me. I understand.

1449
01:35:37,474 --> 01:35:40,518
Will you spare me the compassionate
father routine, Pop?

1450
01:35:41,812 --> 01:35:43,646
The suit don't fit.

1451
01:35:44,481 --> 01:35:45,648
Tommy.

1452
01:35:46,567 --> 01:35:48,609
I'm really trying here.

1453
01:35:49,528 --> 01:35:52,196
- You're trying?
- Yeah, really. I'm trying.

1454
01:35:52,322 --> 01:35:53,448
Now?

1455
01:35:56,118 --> 01:35:58,453
Where were you when it mattered?

1456
01:35:59,538 --> 01:36:03,499
I needed this guy back when I was a kid.
I don't need you now.

1457
01:36:04,251 --> 01:36:07,670
You know, it's too late now.
Everything's already happened.

1458
01:36:08,672 --> 01:36:11,757
You and Brendan don't
seem to understand that.

1459
01:36:12,468 --> 01:36:15,386
Let me explain something
to you, okay?

1460
01:36:15,471 --> 01:36:18,764
The only thing that I have in
common with Brendan Conlon

1461
01:36:18,849 --> 01:36:20,725
is that the pair of us,

1462
01:36:21,894 --> 01:36:24,604
we have absolutely
no use for you.

1463
01:36:29,151 --> 01:36:30,526
Look at you.

1464
01:36:31,778 --> 01:36:34,322
Yeah, I was right.

1465
01:36:35,032 --> 01:36:37,116
I think I liked you better
when you were a drunk.

1466
01:36:37,201 --> 01:36:39,327
At least you had some
balls then, not like now,

1467
01:36:39,411 --> 01:36:43,581
tiptoeing around, like some
beggar with your cup out.

1468
01:36:46,376 --> 01:36:48,586
Take it somewhere else.
In fact, you know what?

1469
01:36:48,670 --> 01:36:49,712
Here's a cup.

1470
01:36:49,796 --> 01:36:53,174
Why don't you take this and go get
yourself some more of your shitty tapes...

1471
01:36:53,258 --> 01:36:55,134
- Don't do this, Tommy.
- ...and you go back to the room

1472
01:36:55,219 --> 01:36:56,886
- and you listen to some more...
- Don't do this.

1473
01:36:56,970 --> 01:37:00,473
Fish stories that no one gives a
shit about. Now get out of here.

1474
01:37:02,226 --> 01:37:04,560
Get the fuck out of here! Go on.

1475
01:37:43,850 --> 01:37:45,393
God pity them!

1476
01:37:45,978 --> 01:37:48,479
All shall perish except me!

1477
01:37:52,484 --> 01:37:56,028
Bastards. Bastards!

1478
01:37:57,281 --> 01:38:00,283
You bastards. You bastards!

1479
01:38:00,701 --> 01:38:03,869
Stop the ship, you bastards!

1480
01:38:03,954 --> 01:38:06,289
Ishmael. God pity them.

1481
01:38:06,999 --> 01:38:10,418
Stop the ship. Please,
stop the ship.

1482
01:38:12,629 --> 01:38:15,214
Stop the ship! Somebody.

1483
01:38:16,633 --> 01:38:17,967
Ahab.

1484
01:38:18,677 --> 01:38:21,137
You godless son of a bitch!

1485
01:38:21,221 --> 01:38:23,097
You stop the ship!

1486
01:38:23,181 --> 01:38:26,309
You godless son of a bitch!

1487
01:38:26,935 --> 01:38:30,396
"'The whale! The ship!' cried
the cringing oarsmen."

1488
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:32,481
"Oars! Oars! Slope downward..."

1489
01:38:32,566 --> 01:38:33,774
Stop it.

1490
01:38:33,984 --> 01:38:36,527
"'O sea that ere it
be for ever too late,

1491
01:38:36,612 --> 01:38:40,031
"'Ahab may slide this last,
last time upon his mark!"'.

1492
01:38:41,825 --> 01:38:43,242
Captain...

1493
01:38:44,453 --> 01:38:46,370
Stop the...

1494
01:38:46,455 --> 01:38:48,748
Captain, stop...

1495
01:38:48,832 --> 01:38:51,167
Stop the ship, Ahab.

1496
01:38:52,669 --> 01:38:54,670
For the love of God.

1497
01:38:55,797 --> 01:38:57,381
They're lost.

1498
01:38:58,425 --> 01:39:00,343
Stop it... The ship.

1499
01:39:04,348 --> 01:39:05,556
Ahab...

1500
01:39:08,727 --> 01:39:10,353
You stop the...

1501
01:39:14,775 --> 01:39:16,317
Oh, no.

1502
01:39:20,781 --> 01:39:22,823
- Come on, give me the Walkman.
- No.

1503
01:39:22,908 --> 01:39:25,117
- No, no.
- Come on.

1504
01:39:25,202 --> 01:39:27,078
Come on, come on. Come,
give me the bottle.

1505
01:39:27,162 --> 01:39:29,121
Come here, come here, come here.

1506
01:39:29,206 --> 01:39:31,540
- Come on. Give me.
- No.

1507
01:39:41,843 --> 01:39:43,177
Tommy.

1508
01:39:44,179 --> 01:39:45,888
We're lost.

1509
01:39:47,641 --> 01:39:49,392
We're lost, Tommy.

1510
01:39:51,061 --> 01:39:54,188
It's over. We'll
never make it back.

1511
01:39:56,066 --> 01:39:58,776
- Stay down.
- We'll never make it back.

1512
01:40:09,705 --> 01:40:10,955
I'm here.

1513
01:40:16,628 --> 01:40:18,421
I always loved you.

1514
01:40:20,590 --> 01:40:22,967
You know that, don't you, Tommy?

1515
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:25,553
I always loved you.

1516
01:40:27,097 --> 01:40:30,474
You and your brother.
My two boys.

1517
01:40:45,991 --> 01:40:49,285
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1518
01:41:02,841 --> 01:41:06,427
Tommy Riordan coming down the
tunnel without his trainer.

1519
01:41:11,433 --> 01:41:13,642
Once again, no walk-out music.

1520
01:41:16,813 --> 01:41:19,315
I'd hardly say no music, Sam.

1521
01:41:24,154 --> 01:41:27,364
Bryan, it sounds like V-J
day in Times Square.

1522
01:41:27,449 --> 01:41:29,450
I've never seen
anything like this.

1523
01:41:46,718 --> 01:41:49,428
Tommy acknowledging his
comrades for the first time

1524
01:41:49,513 --> 01:41:51,680
and climbing into the cage.

1525
01:41:56,353 --> 01:41:58,604
Mad Dog Grimes has been
waiting for revenge

1526
01:41:58,688 --> 01:42:01,398
ever since the day Tommy Riordan
walked into his gym in Pittsburgh

1527
01:42:01,483 --> 01:42:03,317
and turned his life upside down.

1528
01:42:03,401 --> 01:42:07,112
It's been a very long and very miserable
few months for Mad Dog, to say the least.

1529
01:42:08,657 --> 01:42:13,118
Grimes mocking Riordan by having a
camouflage motif for his mohawk tonight,

1530
01:42:13,203 --> 01:42:16,497
and the Marines are really
letting Mad Dog have it.

1531
01:42:20,085 --> 01:42:21,544
All right, gentlemen.

1532
01:42:26,216 --> 01:42:27,758
All right, gentlemen, we've
been over your instructions.

1533
01:42:27,843 --> 01:42:29,134
I expect a clean fight.

1534
01:42:29,219 --> 01:42:32,137
Obey my commands at all times,
defend yourselves at all times.

1535
01:42:32,222 --> 01:42:34,098
Touch gloves, go
back, let's do this.

1536
01:42:34,182 --> 01:42:36,058
It's not gonna happen again.

1537
01:42:37,561 --> 01:42:41,188
Mad Dog chomping at the bit here. He
can't wait to get a piece of Tommy.

1538
01:42:41,273 --> 01:42:42,690
He predicted an early knockout.

1539
01:42:42,774 --> 01:42:45,484
He said he was gonna take
Tommy out with one punch.

1540
01:42:45,569 --> 01:42:48,112
And by the way, he said, "They're
gonna have to pull me off him."

1541
01:42:48,196 --> 01:42:51,073
We'll see what Tommy
has to say about that.

1542
01:42:52,576 --> 01:42:54,076
Gentlemen, you ready?

1543
01:42:54,703 --> 01:42:55,911
You ready?

1544
01:42:57,831 --> 01:43:00,040
- Let's go to war!
- Here they go and they are off!

1545
01:43:01,585 --> 01:43:04,003
Tommy tackles him,
and he's on top!

1546
01:43:04,087 --> 01:43:05,754
He's raining bombs!

1547
01:43:06,089 --> 01:43:08,257
- Cover up!
- Come on, work it.

1548
01:43:09,342 --> 01:43:10,968
- Raining bombs.
- Mad Dog is out.

1549
01:43:11,052 --> 01:43:13,178
Mad Dog's in trouble.
Please stop this.

1550
01:43:13,263 --> 01:43:14,763
Stop it! Stop the fight!

1551
01:43:16,766 --> 01:43:18,809
Break! Break! Break!

1552
01:43:21,563 --> 01:43:23,355
That's the fastest knockout I
think I've ever experienced!

1553
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:26,901
Mad Dog Grimes has been poleaxed.
He is not moving.

1554
01:43:28,695 --> 01:43:32,406
You do that to someone on the street,
they lock you up and throw away the key.

1555
01:43:32,490 --> 01:43:34,074
Break out the yellow tape, Sam.

1556
01:43:34,159 --> 01:43:36,911
This guy's walking away from the cage
like he's leaving a crime scene!

1557
01:43:36,995 --> 01:43:40,164
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1558
01:43:45,921 --> 01:43:48,797
- Everybody through. Come on, move it out.
- Sparta!

1559
01:43:59,935 --> 01:44:01,727
Yeah!

1560
01:44:03,730 --> 01:44:05,230
Mr. C! Mr. C!

1561
01:44:05,315 --> 01:44:06,732
I'm on your side.

1562
01:44:15,825 --> 01:44:17,326
Let's go.

1563
01:44:17,619 --> 01:44:20,454
- Principal Zito, there he is.
- Nice.

1564
01:44:24,501 --> 01:44:26,168
Let's go, Brendan.

1565
01:44:29,506 --> 01:44:33,133
Brendan Conlon came into this
tournament as 1,000-to-one underdog,

1566
01:44:33,218 --> 01:44:35,427
and now here he is
in the final four.

1567
01:44:35,512 --> 01:44:39,098
The crowd showing their appreciation.
He's getting quite the reception.

1568
01:44:39,182 --> 01:44:43,102
He's got a huge reception. I mean,
this guy shocked everybody.

1569
01:44:44,354 --> 01:44:46,313
Come on, come on. You all right?

1570
01:44:48,733 --> 01:44:50,567
You've got a visitor.

1571
01:44:52,779 --> 01:44:54,738
Second row, 10 o'clock.

1572
01:45:03,206 --> 01:45:04,456
You all right with that?

1573
01:45:09,379 --> 01:45:10,421
I love you.

1574
01:45:13,883 --> 01:45:16,093
And here comes the
great Russian, Koba.

1575
01:45:16,177 --> 01:45:19,888
Koba is so intimidating and his
reputation is larger than life.

1576
01:45:19,973 --> 01:45:23,225
- Koba! Koba!
- Koba! Koba!

1577
01:45:28,523 --> 01:45:31,984
I want you to look right at him when
he comes in here. Look right at him.

1578
01:45:32,068 --> 01:45:34,778
All right? Don't take
your eyes off him.

1579
01:46:02,265 --> 01:46:04,308
I'm proud of you, brother.

1580
01:46:04,934 --> 01:46:06,643
This is your cage.

1581
01:46:18,448 --> 01:46:19,865
Gentlemen.

1582
01:46:27,791 --> 01:46:29,333
All right, gentlemen, we've
been over your instructions.

1583
01:46:29,417 --> 01:46:30,876
I expect a clean fight.

1584
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:33,712
Obey my commands at all times,
defend yourselves at all times.

1585
01:46:33,797 --> 01:46:36,340
Touch gloves, go
back, let's do this.

1586
01:46:40,220 --> 01:46:42,888
Should I be nervous for Brendan?
'Cause I am.

1587
01:46:42,972 --> 01:46:45,140
I wanna stop the fight
before it even gets going.

1588
01:46:45,225 --> 01:46:48,310
- Well, here we go.
- He's like a machine. Look at him.

1589
01:46:50,980 --> 01:46:52,648
Gentlemen, you ready?

1590
01:46:53,149 --> 01:46:54,858
You ready? Let's go to war!

1591
01:46:54,943 --> 01:46:56,443
Keep your hands up, Brendan.
Hands up.

1592
01:46:56,528 --> 01:47:00,447
But now, the question is, how long
can Brendan Conlon stay alive?

1593
01:47:00,657 --> 01:47:01,824
Angle out of it!

1594
01:47:03,827 --> 01:47:05,327
Keep moving!

1595
01:47:06,913 --> 01:47:09,414
Get out of there!
Get out of there!

1596
01:47:13,670 --> 01:47:15,921
Keep moving! Keep moving!
Get away from him!

1597
01:47:16,005 --> 01:47:17,714
Hit him, babe! Hit him!
Get in there!

1598
01:47:19,801 --> 01:47:21,844
- Crushing body shots.
- Relax, you're okay.

1599
01:47:21,928 --> 01:47:23,846
Conlon's down, and Koba
pounces and starts pounding!

1600
01:47:23,930 --> 01:47:25,305
Get up! Get up!

1601
01:47:25,390 --> 01:47:27,349
He's just pounding on him
like a side of beef.

1602
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:28,976
Go, go, go. Get up!

1603
01:47:29,936 --> 01:47:30,978
He's getting his ass whooped.

1604
01:47:33,815 --> 01:47:35,274
And now he's got him in the air!

1605
01:47:35,358 --> 01:47:37,025
Oh, God.

1606
01:47:37,110 --> 01:47:39,361
Relax, tie up his arm!
Tie him up!

1607
01:47:43,032 --> 01:47:45,367
I think Campana has to
think seriously about...

1608
01:47:45,451 --> 01:47:47,786
- How much abuse can one man take?
- ...continuing another round of this.

1609
01:47:47,871 --> 01:47:48,996
Go to war!

1610
01:47:52,876 --> 01:47:56,545
Just relax! Relax! Relax!
Off the fence!

1611
01:47:57,755 --> 01:48:00,883
Brendan's going for a ride!

1612
01:48:00,967 --> 01:48:03,552
That one shook the
entire building!

1613
01:48:05,221 --> 01:48:07,598
Man, he just threw him against
the fence like a rag doll.

1614
01:48:07,682 --> 01:48:11,476
Get up! Get up! Come on! Hold on!
Turn it in! Turn in!

1615
01:48:11,561 --> 01:48:13,270
And now he's on top!
Koba's on top,

1616
01:48:13,354 --> 01:48:16,315
and he's finishing him, here. Look at this.
On the edge of blowing it.

1617
01:48:16,399 --> 01:48:18,317
Get off the fence, Brendan!

1618
01:48:18,401 --> 01:48:21,069
You wonder how Conlon can take
this kind of beating on his arms.

1619
01:48:21,154 --> 01:48:24,239
- His forearms and his hands.
- Drop that neck!

1620
01:48:24,324 --> 01:48:25,824
How much can one man take?

1621
01:48:26,743 --> 01:48:28,202
Break! Break! Break!

1622
01:48:30,496 --> 01:48:32,706
Everybody has got to be
a little bit concerned

1623
01:48:32,790 --> 01:48:35,542
about Brendan Conlon's bravery
getting him in trouble here.

1624
01:48:35,627 --> 01:48:37,586
His bravery could get
him killed, frankly.

1625
01:48:37,670 --> 01:48:39,838
And by the way, he's got
nothing more to prove.

1626
01:48:39,923 --> 01:48:41,715
- He's lasted two rounds with Koba.
- That's true, that's true.

1627
01:48:41,799 --> 01:48:43,926
And you wonder what's
keeping this guy up.

1628
01:48:45,053 --> 01:48:46,970
Sit down. Sit down.

1629
01:48:48,097 --> 01:48:49,723
Breathe. Breathe!

1630
01:48:50,433 --> 01:48:52,559
Look at me. Look at me!

1631
01:48:52,644 --> 01:48:55,938
Wait up. Small sips. Hold it.
Hold it, small sips.

1632
01:48:58,983 --> 01:49:01,360
Why are we here? Why
are we here, Brendan?

1633
01:49:01,444 --> 01:49:02,903
Why are we here? Are we
here to win this fight?

1634
01:49:02,987 --> 01:49:04,238
Are we here to win this fight?

1635
01:49:04,322 --> 01:49:06,990
You tell me. 'Cause if we're
not, I will throw in the towel.

1636
01:49:07,075 --> 01:49:09,034
We will get Tess and
we will go home.

1637
01:49:09,118 --> 01:49:11,119
We'll go home, okay?

1638
01:49:11,871 --> 01:49:14,122
You don't knock him out,
you lose the fight.

1639
01:49:14,374 --> 01:49:16,166
Do you understand me?

1640
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:20,003
You don't knock him out,
you don't have a home.

1641
01:49:20,463 --> 01:49:22,464
Let's go! Seconds out!
Seconds out!

1642
01:49:41,651 --> 01:49:43,986
Gentlemen! Let's go to war!

1643
01:49:48,283 --> 01:49:51,702
Conlon somehow answering
the call to round three.

1644
01:49:51,786 --> 01:49:54,204
And Koba's all over
him once again.

1645
01:49:57,292 --> 01:49:58,500
Brendan's giving back, Bryan.

1646
01:49:58,584 --> 01:50:00,419
I mean, there's signs of
life in Brendan Conlon.

1647
01:50:01,045 --> 01:50:02,838
He's starting to mix it up.

1648
01:50:10,972 --> 01:50:12,347
Pummel, pummel, pummel.

1649
01:50:15,143 --> 01:50:17,519
He's taking Koba down, but
the Russian's back up.

1650
01:50:18,313 --> 01:50:20,105
Brendan shoots him again,
pressing him against the cage.

1651
01:50:20,189 --> 01:50:22,941
- Yes!
- Whoa, he's fallen deep into a guillotine.

1652
01:50:23,026 --> 01:50:24,901
Well, Conlon trapped
in an iron vice here,

1653
01:50:24,986 --> 01:50:26,945
and Koba now squeezing his
neck for all it's worth,

1654
01:50:27,030 --> 01:50:28,030
trying to choke the teacher out.

1655
01:50:28,114 --> 01:50:30,949
Hips, hips, hips! Breathe!
Breathe!

1656
01:50:31,034 --> 01:50:33,035
Ride it out! Ride it out!

1657
01:50:33,953 --> 01:50:35,620
Conlon looking for a way out.

1658
01:50:35,705 --> 01:50:38,540
- What is this?
- Just tossed Koba. Can you believe this?

1659
01:50:38,624 --> 01:50:41,293
He just shook off a
guillotine and tossed Koba.

1660
01:50:41,377 --> 01:50:43,587
Conlon's looking for an armbar.
He's looking for that armbar,

1661
01:50:43,671 --> 01:50:46,214
- and he's trying to submit the Russian bear.
- Hips, hips, hips!

1662
01:50:46,299 --> 01:50:47,674
Yeah, you got him! You got him!
You got him!

1663
01:50:48,301 --> 01:50:50,093
Koba slips right out.

1664
01:50:50,636 --> 01:50:53,555
Conlon's staying after him.
He's squeezing the bear.

1665
01:50:53,890 --> 01:50:57,351
The tables have turned and the boy scout
is actually messing with the bear.

1666
01:50:57,435 --> 01:50:59,561
The teacher springing off the
fence and going for a mountain,

1667
01:50:59,645 --> 01:51:00,645
- but Koba's on his feet.
- Get up, get up!

1668
01:51:00,730 --> 01:51:02,230
He does not want to be on
the ground with Brendan

1669
01:51:02,315 --> 01:51:04,316
and his endless bag
of submissions.

1670
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:07,819
Koba trying to reestablish his dominance
with brutal shots to the face.

1671
01:51:07,904 --> 01:51:10,822
But Conlon's showing no fear.
This is a fight!

1672
01:51:10,907 --> 01:51:13,158
We have got ourselves a fight!

1673
01:51:16,913 --> 01:51:19,164
Wow, that's a huge
elbow to the head.

1674
01:51:19,248 --> 01:51:21,500
And now, Conlon goes for a knee bar.
He's got it very deep!

1675
01:51:21,584 --> 01:51:23,585
He's got it very, very deep!

1676
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:25,003
He's deep on that.

1677
01:51:25,755 --> 01:51:27,172
He's got Koba in a lot of pain.

1678
01:51:27,256 --> 01:51:29,049
We saw this with Midnight,
we saw it against The Dane,

1679
01:51:29,133 --> 01:51:30,842
and we're seeing it here!
Brendan Conlon...

1680
01:51:31,177 --> 01:51:33,720
Break it! Break it! Break it!

1681
01:51:34,430 --> 01:51:35,847
Not letting out!

1682
01:51:35,932 --> 01:51:38,016
Conlon wrenching that
knee for all it's worth.

1683
01:51:38,101 --> 01:51:39,851
He's putting everything
he has into it.

1684
01:51:41,354 --> 01:51:43,688
And Koba is screaming in pain.

1685
01:51:43,773 --> 01:51:44,773
Koba taps.

1686
01:51:44,857 --> 01:51:47,275
Koba has tapped! Brendan
Conlon has tapped Koba!

1687
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:51,154
I can't believe it! Brendan
Conlon has tapped Koba!

1688
01:51:51,239 --> 01:51:53,824
He's tapped Koba!

1689
01:51:53,908 --> 01:51:56,660
And Frank Campana
can't believe it.

1690
01:51:56,744 --> 01:51:59,287
This whole place can't believe it.
I can't believe it.

1691
01:51:59,372 --> 01:52:02,582
Brendan Conlon has
tapped the great Koba.

1692
01:52:03,251 --> 01:52:06,795
- Tess!
- You got it! You did it!

1693
01:52:06,879 --> 01:52:10,173
Brendan taps the world Sambo
champ with a knee bar!

1694
01:52:10,258 --> 01:52:11,883
- Babe, you did it!
- Brendan Conlon!

1695
01:52:11,968 --> 01:52:14,719
- I don't know what to say. It's amazing!
- I don't know what I just saw.

1696
01:52:14,804 --> 01:52:16,972
I just don't know how to
put this into context.

1697
01:52:17,056 --> 01:52:19,891
That's gotta be the biggest
upset in MMA history.

1698
01:52:19,976 --> 01:52:22,060
I have never seen
anything like this.

1699
01:52:22,145 --> 01:52:25,605
He tapped a world Sambo
champion in a knee bar!

1700
01:52:27,442 --> 01:52:30,735
Brendan Conlon has
tapped the great Koba!

1701
01:52:30,820 --> 01:52:34,656
Brendan Conlon, the physics teacher!
Brendan Conlon, the civilian!

1702
01:52:34,866 --> 01:52:36,908
He's done the impossible.

1703
01:52:36,993 --> 01:52:40,454
He has done the impossible.
He's pulled off a miracle.

1704
01:52:40,830 --> 01:52:44,666
This place is going crazy because
they've just seen a miracle.

1705
01:52:56,471 --> 01:52:58,972
This is CNN Breaking News.

1706
01:52:59,682 --> 01:53:03,435
A surprising turn in the story
of Iraq War hero, Tommy Riordan.

1707
01:53:04,020 --> 01:53:07,022
CNN has learned that
Riordan's true identity

1708
01:53:07,106 --> 01:53:09,941
is that of Marine Staff
Sergeant Thomas Conlon,

1709
01:53:10,026 --> 01:53:12,903
who went AWOL from his
unit earlier this year,

1710
01:53:12,987 --> 01:53:15,864
following the friendly fire
death of his brother-in-arms,

1711
01:53:15,948 --> 01:53:17,324
Sergeant Manny Fernandez.

1712
01:53:17,658 --> 01:53:20,535
Fernandez's wife, Pilar
Fernandez, spoke with me

1713
01:53:20,620 --> 01:53:23,246
in an exclusive
interview, moments ago.

1714
01:53:23,873 --> 01:53:25,832
The bombs started dropping.

1715
01:53:26,584 --> 01:53:29,461
They were coming from US planes.

1716
01:53:29,545 --> 01:53:33,381
Tommy and Manny were
waving their flags

1717
01:53:34,342 --> 01:53:36,801
to let them know
they were Americans,

1718
01:53:36,886 --> 01:53:38,512
but they didn't stop.

1719
01:53:40,056 --> 01:53:41,556
Everyone died.

1720
01:53:42,266 --> 01:53:44,184
Everyone except Tommy.

1721
01:53:45,019 --> 01:53:48,480
And, you know, my
Manny used to say,

1722
01:53:51,234 --> 01:53:53,735
that Tommy was the
brother he never had.

1723
01:53:54,403 --> 01:53:58,365
Conlon, who is fighting in the mixed
martial arts mega tournament, Sparta,

1724
01:53:58,449 --> 01:54:01,826
is expected to be taken into
custody by military police,

1725
01:54:01,911 --> 01:54:05,038
following tonight's winner-take-all
finale in Atlantic City.

1726
01:54:05,122 --> 01:54:09,501
If victorious, he has pledged
his $5 million purse

1727
01:54:09,585 --> 01:54:11,461
to the widow of his
fallen comrade.

1728
01:54:13,172 --> 01:54:15,173
We've just got some
incredible news,

1729
01:54:15,258 --> 01:54:17,926
that I'm having trouble putting
into context, but here it is.

1730
01:54:18,261 --> 01:54:22,180
The two men fighting for
the championship tonight,

1731
01:54:22,265 --> 01:54:24,432
for the $5 million prize,

1732
01:54:24,559 --> 01:54:28,019
for the middleweight
championship of the world,

1733
01:54:28,104 --> 01:54:29,604
are brothers.

1734
01:54:55,798 --> 01:54:58,049
All right, let's get this off.

1735
01:55:15,276 --> 01:55:17,152
What are you gonna do?

1736
01:55:22,033 --> 01:55:23,783
I'm gonna fight him.

1737
01:56:34,605 --> 01:56:38,066
- Mr. C, Mr. C!
- Mr. C, Mr. C!

1738
01:57:23,821 --> 01:57:26,990
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1739
01:58:25,341 --> 01:58:26,674
Gentlemen.

1740
01:58:33,516 --> 01:58:35,934
Gentlemen, this is the final.
I expect a clean fight.

1741
01:58:36,018 --> 01:58:39,103
Obey my commands at all times,
defend yourselves at all times.

1742
01:58:39,188 --> 01:58:40,980
Touch gloves, go
back, let's do this.

1743
01:58:41,065 --> 01:58:42,482
Where's Pop?

1744
01:59:02,878 --> 01:59:04,879
Gentlemen, are you ready?

1745
01:59:06,131 --> 01:59:07,549
Are you ready?

1746
01:59:08,884 --> 01:59:10,051
Let's go to war!

1747
01:59:22,106 --> 01:59:24,065
Relax, Brendan, relax!

1748
01:59:28,112 --> 01:59:29,737
Get out! Get out of there!

1749
01:59:31,240 --> 01:59:36,160
Throw your hands!

1750
01:59:36,245 --> 01:59:38,329
Don't lose it. No, no, no!

1751
01:59:38,414 --> 01:59:39,914
Move! Move!

1752
01:59:42,084 --> 01:59:45,253
Tie him up! Tie him up! Control his moves.
Control his moves.

1753
01:59:45,671 --> 01:59:48,131
Control the arms! Keep control
in the arms! Breathe!

1754
01:59:48,674 --> 01:59:51,593
You're okay! Relax! Breathe!

1755
01:59:57,433 --> 01:59:59,601
Get up! Get up! Get up!

1756
01:59:59,685 --> 02:00:01,603
Relax! Breathe!

1757
02:00:01,937 --> 02:00:04,856
Tie him up! Get up! Tie him up, Brendan!
Tie him up!

1758
02:00:05,566 --> 02:00:06,941
Come on. Get him! Get him!
Get him!

1759
02:00:07,943 --> 02:00:09,277
Break!

1760
02:00:09,528 --> 02:00:10,778
What was that?

1761
02:00:10,863 --> 02:00:12,280
Hey, come on, Josh!

1762
02:00:12,531 --> 02:00:13,615
What's up with that?

1763
02:00:13,949 --> 02:00:15,700
Hey, step back!

1764
02:00:15,784 --> 02:00:17,327
Watch that late blow!

1765
02:00:18,037 --> 02:00:19,287
Come on!

1766
02:00:27,463 --> 02:00:29,380
Come on, Josh! I
mean, what is that?

1767
02:00:29,465 --> 02:00:31,633
Come on, come on. Sit down.
Sit, sit, sit.

1768
02:00:31,717 --> 02:00:33,509
Sit... Brendan, sit down.

1769
02:00:33,594 --> 02:00:35,678
Look at me. Sit down.

1770
02:00:36,305 --> 02:00:38,473
Brendan, look at me. Look at me.

1771
02:00:39,683 --> 02:00:44,062
Look at me, Brendan. Let it go.
Let it go, okay?

1772
02:00:44,146 --> 02:00:46,689
Breathe. Beethoven.

1773
02:00:47,316 --> 02:00:50,693
Okay. He's coming right at you, right?
Exactly like we planned.

1774
02:00:50,778 --> 02:00:53,905
I want you to angle out, hit and
move every time. All right?

1775
02:00:53,989 --> 02:00:55,281
- Angle out and move.
- Good.

1776
02:00:55,366 --> 02:00:57,825
Breathe. Breathe.
Come on, relax.

1777
02:00:59,912 --> 02:01:02,747
- Okay. He's not your brother, right?
- Time's up!

1778
02:01:02,831 --> 02:01:04,666
Look at me. He's not
your brother, right?

1779
02:01:04,750 --> 02:01:05,833
- All right.
- He's in the way.

1780
02:01:05,960 --> 02:01:08,294
Seconds out. Wrap it up.

1781
02:01:08,379 --> 02:01:10,797
Taking a little more
time for the cheap shot.

1782
02:01:13,342 --> 02:01:15,176
Do your job, Josh.

1783
02:01:20,307 --> 02:01:21,683
Come on, babe. Come on.

1784
02:01:21,850 --> 02:01:23,434
Let's go to war.

1785
02:01:23,519 --> 02:01:24,519
Breathe!

1786
02:01:29,692 --> 02:01:31,901
Pace, pace! Control the pace!

1787
02:01:42,204 --> 02:01:43,204
Cover up!

1788
02:01:44,123 --> 02:01:46,457
Come on, get off the fence!

1789
02:01:46,542 --> 02:01:47,709
Get off the fence!

1790
02:01:48,544 --> 02:01:49,752
Hands up! Hands up!

1791
02:01:51,213 --> 02:01:54,132
Head up! You're all right!
Relax! Breathe!

1792
02:01:56,135 --> 02:01:57,218
Yeah!

1793
02:02:03,726 --> 02:02:04,726
Get him!

1794
02:02:07,730 --> 02:02:10,773
- Huge throw. Huge.
- Look at that.

1795
02:02:10,858 --> 02:02:12,483
Turn in! Don't give
him your back!

1796
02:02:12,568 --> 02:02:14,235
Turn in! Go! Good! Good!

1797
02:02:17,364 --> 02:02:19,490
Come on, get out of it!
Go! Get up!

1798
02:02:21,035 --> 02:02:22,452
Control the arms!
Control the arms!

1799
02:02:24,830 --> 02:02:27,373
Cover up, cover up. Push it!

1800
02:02:29,084 --> 02:02:30,585
Break free! Break! Break!

1801
02:02:32,337 --> 02:02:35,214
Good, good, good! Clean break!
Stop! Hey, stop!

1802
02:02:35,299 --> 02:02:36,924
- Come on.
- Here we go, mom.

1803
02:02:37,009 --> 02:02:40,553
Time to lock up your china,
the boys are at it again!

1804
02:02:46,518 --> 02:02:47,602
Let's go to war!

1805
02:03:05,579 --> 02:03:07,497
Now! Get up! Get up!

1806
02:03:08,499 --> 02:03:10,041
Get up! Come on, babe! Get up!
Get up! Get up!

1807
02:03:10,125 --> 02:03:11,959
Control it! Control
it with the arms.

1808
02:03:12,044 --> 02:03:13,586
Switch! Switch!

1809
02:03:15,714 --> 02:03:17,048
Hips!

1810
02:03:17,591 --> 02:03:19,342
Down, down. Hips down.

1811
02:03:23,138 --> 02:03:26,390
Oh, my God. That's a deep omoplata there.
He's got the seats up.

1812
02:03:27,810 --> 02:03:29,477
Come on, Tommy!

1813
02:03:34,274 --> 02:03:36,567
You've got him, babe! You've got him, babe!
Come on, tap him out!

1814
02:03:37,319 --> 02:03:38,444
Tom!

1815
02:03:45,953 --> 02:03:47,203
Break! Break! Break!

1816
02:03:47,287 --> 02:03:49,831
Tommy, you okay?

1817
02:03:54,336 --> 02:03:56,838
- Tommy!
- Go! Let's go! Go!

1818
02:03:56,922 --> 02:03:58,339
Calm down. Calm down.

1819
02:03:59,383 --> 02:04:01,926
- It's the championship. Keep it together.
- All right. All right. I got it.

1820
02:04:02,010 --> 02:04:03,511
Sit down. Sit down!

1821
02:04:10,978 --> 02:04:12,770
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1822
02:04:12,855 --> 02:04:16,065
- I popped his shoulder.
- Relax. Breathe. Breathe.

1823
02:04:16,150 --> 02:04:17,775
- I heard it tear.
- You popped his shoulder?

1824
02:04:17,860 --> 02:04:18,901
- Yeah.
- Good. Okay.

1825
02:04:18,986 --> 02:04:21,612
I want you to pop his other shoulder.
Let's go.

1826
02:04:21,697 --> 02:04:23,573
- Josh.
- Hey, hey, no Josh.

1827
02:04:23,657 --> 02:04:24,782
- Josh.
- Hey!

1828
02:04:24,867 --> 02:04:26,284
- Look at me. Look at me.
- What?

1829
02:04:26,368 --> 02:04:28,161
All right, you got two rounds.
Two rounds.

1830
02:04:28,245 --> 02:04:29,537
We need both rounds.

1831
02:04:32,291 --> 02:04:33,374
What?

1832
02:04:33,458 --> 02:04:36,544
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1833
02:04:43,093 --> 02:04:46,220
Go in there, you kick him in the
head, take him down and finish him!

1834
02:04:53,812 --> 02:04:56,189
Tommy, what are you doing?

1835
02:04:56,940 --> 02:04:58,566
Shut up. Come on.

1836
02:04:59,526 --> 02:05:00,985
Stand back.

1837
02:05:01,737 --> 02:05:04,864
Come on. What? Have
you gone crazy?

1838
02:05:06,366 --> 02:05:08,034
Let's go to war!

1839
02:05:09,411 --> 02:05:11,746
Brendan, pick your hands up!

1840
02:05:12,456 --> 02:05:13,706
It's over.

1841
02:05:14,917 --> 02:05:17,585
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1842
02:05:19,087 --> 02:05:20,755
It's over, Tommy.

1843
02:05:21,006 --> 02:05:22,006
You better fight!

1844
02:05:32,935 --> 02:05:35,019
It's over, Tommy. Come on.

1845
02:05:39,149 --> 02:05:41,525
Tommy, we don't have to do this.

1846
02:05:53,330 --> 02:05:55,915
Come on. Why do you
want to do this, Tommy?

1847
02:05:56,250 --> 02:05:57,583
Am I gonna have to
watch you do this?

1848
02:06:05,259 --> 02:06:07,510
Okay? You all right there?

1849
02:06:08,303 --> 02:06:09,637
Tommy!

1850
02:06:20,065 --> 02:06:22,566
Quick, finish him!
You finish him!

1851
02:06:29,241 --> 02:06:30,616
Come on.

1852
02:06:41,378 --> 02:06:44,338
Break, break, break!
Back up, back up!

1853
02:08:41,873 --> 02:08:45,459
I'm sorry, Tommy. I'm sorry.

1854
02:08:48,672 --> 02:08:50,631
Tap, Tommy.

1855
02:08:51,299 --> 02:08:53,759
It's okay. It's okay.

1856
02:09:03,728 --> 02:09:05,271
I love you.

1857
02:09:06,481 --> 02:09:07,982
I love you, Tommy.

1857
02:09:08,305 --> 02:10:08,218
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
