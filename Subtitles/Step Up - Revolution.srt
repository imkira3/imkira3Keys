159
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:09,076
<i>a bi/lion-dollar development project
somewhere in downtown Miami.</i>

160
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,665
- Morning.
- I can make you some eggs.

161
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:15,089
That's okay. I've got to go to work early
for some meeting.

162
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,667
So? You see it?

163
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,509
Come on. It was the best one yet.

164
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,222
Mom, what's Sean talking about?

165
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,345
SEAN: Your uncle shut down Ocean Drive
yesterday.

166
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:28,599
Sarah, go brush your teeth.
We're gonna leave in five minutes.

167
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,146
Fine.

168

Could you please stop that?

169

that what you're doing is okay.

171

when you get arrested?

173

I'm not gonna get busted.
Why are you acting like this?

174

Because this whole contest
is a long shot. At best.

and get a profession?

00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:09,386
I was talking to my friend, Jessica.

180
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,888
Take a look at this.

181
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,102
She works at this shipping company,

182
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,776
and they have this
management training program.

183
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,228
You have to start out at the bottom,

184

but if you catch on,
they even pay for your night school.

185

Please just think about it.

186

I don't have to think about it.

187

We are gonna win this thing.

188
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:34,120
When we do, people are gonna notice.
They'll have to.

189

Sarah, come on!

190
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,919
Well, let's hope so.

191
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:46,597
Because right now, you're getting
your butts kicked by a singing cat.

I came to Miami for one reason.</i>

194
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,754
To turn the Dimont into the top destination
in South Beach.

195
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,423
And that's just the beginning
In the coming months,

196
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:31,760
I plan to break ground
on a new hotel and residential complex.

197
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:36,268
And after that, continue building
the greatest hotels Miami has ever seen.

198

If you work hard for me,
I will be loyal to you.

199
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:42,733
Mr. Ryan, for example, started working for
me when he was still in business school.

200
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,564
And now he's general manager
of the Dimont.

Because the whole thing goes against
every instinct I have <i>as</i> a parent.

221

I don't understand why.

Look at it from my perspective.

223
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:44,086
It's like I'm rewarding you
for dropping out of college.

224

I only went to college
because you wanted me to.

So this is all about
the Wynwood thing, right?

- Yeah.
- It's one thing to dance when you're a kid,

231
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,525
and it's another thing
to try to make a career out of it.
