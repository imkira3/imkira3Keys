1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:02:51,495 --> 00:02:54,866
731 arriving at Lockup 16.
Prisoner on board.

3
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:58,729
- Request assistance.
- Affirmative. Proceed to Bay 2.

4
00:03:06,113 --> 00:03:07,316
This is Thrasher.

5
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:10,186
All units be on the lookout
for Detective Stone.

6
00:03:10,286 --> 00:03:12,223
He's armed and dangerous.

7
00:03:12,323 --> 00:03:14,825
If anyone spots him,
report to me immediately.

8
00:03:14,925 --> 00:03:16,660
Durkin, where the hell are you?

9
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,600
I've located Stone,
passing Trafalgar Square.

10
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,696
On his tail, sir.

11
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:27,042
While the United States blocks yet
another UN resolution on global warming...

12
00:03:27,142 --> 00:03:28,978
London continues to suffer...

13
00:03:29,078 --> 00:03:33,518
as the River Thames rises to its highest
level since Black November, 1999.

14
00:03:33,618 --> 00:03:36,322
With the approaching full moon
and persistent rains...

15
00:03:36,422 --> 00:03:39,692
the further outlook
for Londoners appears bleak.

16
00:03:39,792 --> 00:03:44,030
As the tides continue to rise,
the dramatic increase in rat infestation...

17
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,134
is evident throughout the city.

18
00:03:46,234 --> 00:03:49,304
Those attacked should report
to their local rodent center...

19
00:03:49,404 --> 00:03:52,130
for immediate medical attention.

20
00:05:26,299 --> 00:05:28,092
Police, dickhead.

21
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,709
£50, two drinks minimum.

22
00:05:56,807 --> 00:05:58,701
- Watch him.
- Okay.

23
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,269
Damn it.

24
00:06:35,656 --> 00:06:39,055
- What can I get you?
- You got coffee?

25
00:06:39,228 --> 00:06:41,199
It's two drinks minimum.

26
00:06:41,299 --> 00:06:44,434
Give me two coffees, extra sugar.

27
00:06:54,182 --> 00:06:55,781
Access code.

28
00:06:59,555 --> 00:07:03,426
- Special Unit, can I help you?
- Get me Pat O'Donnell please.

29
00:07:03,526 --> 00:07:05,719
One moment, I'll transfer you.

30
00:07:06,531 --> 00:07:08,131
Come on, Pat.

31
00:07:09,935 --> 00:07:13,240
Excuse me, please, I have to pee.
Will you watch the door for me?

32
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,009
- Sure, babe.
- Thank you.

33
00:07:17,611 --> 00:07:20,111
Don't be a creep and peek, okay?

34
00:07:21,216 --> 00:07:23,853
- O'Donnell, here.
- Hi, Pat. This is Stone, here.

35
00:07:23,953 --> 00:07:27,224
- Don't call me, you were just suspended.
- Did you get the report yet?

36
00:07:27,324 --> 00:07:30,060
No, maybe the bastard
won't show this time.

37
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,920
He'll show.

38
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,524
I know he will.

39
00:07:36,638 --> 00:07:40,536
I need some coffee.
Where the fuck is my coffee?

40
00:07:53,126 --> 00:07:55,089
I know you're here.

41
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:39,513
Son of a bitch.

42
00:08:46,061 --> 00:08:48,026
Freeze! Don't move.

43
00:08:48,765 --> 00:08:50,866
Show me your hands, man.

44
00:08:54,774 --> 00:08:57,168
Somebody must have seen something.

45
00:08:58,077 --> 00:08:59,471
You?

46
00:09:07,758 --> 00:09:09,983
You know something.

47
00:09:10,361 --> 00:09:12,494
What about you, dickhead?

48
00:09:13,499 --> 00:09:14,867
I know.

49
00:09:14,967 --> 00:09:17,033
I know you saw him.

50
00:09:39,866 --> 00:09:42,262
- Where did he go?
- Don't shoot!

51
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:45,531
- Talk to me!
- I didn't see anything!

52
00:09:45,706 --> 00:09:47,603
- Freeze!
- Police!

53
00:09:48,577 --> 00:09:50,406
Get out of my way!

54
00:10:04,966 --> 00:10:06,859
God!

55
00:10:14,003 --> 00:10:16,195
I can hear your heartbeat.

56
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,599
I'll find you.

57
00:10:23,782 --> 00:10:25,210
You fuck!

58
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,197
Then what?

59
00:10:35,297 --> 00:10:37,668
He started raving like a lunatic,
out of control.

60
00:10:37,768 --> 00:10:39,870
It took four officers to subdue him.

61
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,838
- Where is he now?
- Lockup.

62
00:10:41,938 --> 00:10:43,368
What happened to him?

63
00:10:43,608 --> 00:10:47,246
A serial killer murdered his partner,
Foster, three years ago.

64
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:48,948
He was there when it happened.

65
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:52,513
- Survivor's guilt.
- Just plain guilt.

66
00:10:52,687 --> 00:10:55,357
Had an affair
with Foster's wife, left her...

67
00:10:55,457 --> 00:10:57,827
hit the booze, went over the edge.

68
00:10:57,927 --> 00:11:00,893
Now he lives on anxiety,
coffee and chocolate.

69
00:11:01,031 --> 00:11:03,257
If you ask me, he's nuts.

70
00:11:03,902 --> 00:11:07,561
That's what the doctors say.
Here, read the file.

71
00:11:08,174 --> 00:11:12,179
He's worked in every hellhole in the world
and been fired from all of them.

72
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:15,540
- They say he's the best.
- He is.

73
00:11:16,252 --> 00:11:19,555
I followed him down an alleyway.
He shot a trashcan.

74
00:11:19,655 --> 00:11:21,517
Sounds like Stone.

75
00:11:21,859 --> 00:11:25,730
- Maybe you'll be a soothing influence.
- Pardon me?

76
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,624
He's your new partner.

77
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:34,037
What's the matter with you, Stone?

78
00:11:34,207 --> 00:11:37,538
- Where's my other piece, Pat?
- You mean the cannon.

79
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,448
The Chief's got that.

80
00:11:39,548 --> 00:11:42,377
He said he wanted to see you,
said it was urgent.

81
00:11:48,627 --> 00:11:50,089
Hiya, Stone!

82
00:11:53,834 --> 00:11:55,524
Get a move on.

83
00:12:04,715 --> 00:12:07,611
- Careful, sweetheart.
- It's good to have you back.

84
00:12:28,446 --> 00:12:30,547
What the fuck are you doing here?

85
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,880
I thought you were suspended.

86
00:12:46,903 --> 00:12:49,436
Stone, get your ass in here!

87
00:13:06,663 --> 00:13:10,995
- What the fuck's this?
- Hi, Chief. How are you doing?

88
00:13:11,369 --> 00:13:13,503
Answer the question.

89
00:13:14,307 --> 00:13:15,906
It's a gun.

90
00:13:16,643 --> 00:13:19,004
Don't be a smart-ass. This isn't funny.

91
00:13:19,313 --> 00:13:21,174
I'm not laughing.

92
00:13:22,251 --> 00:13:24,180
The killer is back.

93
00:13:25,187 --> 00:13:28,084
I thought you said
this guy wouldn't be back.

94
00:13:28,192 --> 00:13:32,097
Sir, all research shows that a serial killer
of this type doesn't come back.

95
00:13:32,197 --> 00:13:35,368
- Who is this?
- Detective Dick Durkin.

96
00:13:35,768 --> 00:13:38,305
- Are you sure it's him?
- He ripped her heart out.

97
00:13:38,405 --> 00:13:42,235
- Her heart? What for?
- Maybe he eats them for breakfast.

98
00:13:46,249 --> 00:13:48,452
This wasn't in the police reports
or the papers.

99
00:13:48,552 --> 00:13:51,450
It's never going to be. You got that?

100
00:13:51,688 --> 00:13:54,926
Jesus, if they get wind of this,
they'll have a field day.

101
00:13:55,026 --> 00:13:56,957
This changes things.

102
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,467
I thought we were dealing
with a psychotic, not a psychopath.

103
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:02,703
With such incredible strength,
he must be...

104
00:14:02,803 --> 00:14:05,807
under extreme mental distress
or on some kind of stimulant.

105
00:14:05,907 --> 00:14:07,473
Who is this?

106
00:14:08,677 --> 00:14:12,716
I'm curious. How did you know he was
going to strike at that club last night?

107
00:14:12,816 --> 00:14:13,785
I didn't.

108
00:14:13,885 --> 00:14:16,521
- But you were there before he struck.
- So?

109
00:14:16,621 --> 00:14:19,256
That's an incredible coincidence.

110
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:24,292
Do you know what this is?
It's a medical report on you.

111
00:14:26,535 --> 00:14:31,196
The doctors say you have anxiety neurosis
to the point of being paranoid.

112
00:14:31,408 --> 00:14:33,634
Doctors don't know shit.

113
00:14:33,979 --> 00:14:36,977
How many weapons are you carrying,
besides this cannon?

114
00:14:37,817 --> 00:14:40,178
- An MP-15.
- What else?

115
00:14:41,288 --> 00:14:43,115
- A Glock 50.
- And?

116
00:14:43,957 --> 00:14:46,262
An A-3 assault shotgun.

117
00:14:46,362 --> 00:14:50,123
If that's not paranoid,
I don't know what the fuck is.

118
00:14:50,867 --> 00:14:53,534
I'm surprised you don't have
a grenade launcher.

119
00:14:53,704 --> 00:14:56,965
- I couldn't get a permit.
- This isn't funny!

120
00:15:00,713 --> 00:15:03,575
- I just want to be ready.
- Ready for what?

121
00:15:04,351 --> 00:15:07,022
You can't even find the bastard,
let alone shoot him.

122
00:15:07,122 --> 00:15:08,523
I can find him.

123
00:15:08,623 --> 00:15:10,927
If you know so much about this fella...

124
00:15:11,027 --> 00:15:13,630
how come we've got a corpse
with her heart ripped out?

125
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:16,991
And you're up alleyways
shooting at water rats.

126
00:15:18,603 --> 00:15:21,967
- Have you been following me?
- Damn right, he has.

127
00:15:22,543 --> 00:15:25,546
Paranoid people with guns
are a menace to society.

128
00:15:25,646 --> 00:15:29,084
You'd be paranoid, too, if you had
a dipshit like this following you.

129
00:15:29,184 --> 00:15:32,321
This dipshit happens to be
an expert on serial killers.

130
00:15:32,421 --> 00:15:36,390
If he's such an expert,
what the fuck is he following me for?

131
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:41,896
You're officially off suspension.

132
00:15:44,571 --> 00:15:45,739
But if you fuck up again...

133
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,177
I'll have your arse shipped
to the worst hellhole on this planet.

134
00:15:49,277 --> 00:15:51,343
Worse than this place?

135
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,944
And there's a condition, Stone,
my condition.

136
00:15:55,485 --> 00:15:57,346
He goes with you.

137
00:15:58,289 --> 00:15:59,690
I work alone.

138
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,629
You work with who I say,
or you don't work at all.

139
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:06,167
'Cause as far as I'm concerned,
you're just another crazy with a gun.

140
00:16:06,267 --> 00:16:09,459
Your concern for my welfare is touching.

141
00:16:10,605 --> 00:16:13,036
Get the fuck out of my office.

142
00:16:19,117 --> 00:16:20,945
You got a pen?

143
00:16:25,825 --> 00:16:29,062
Detective Dick Durkin, you got a car?

144
00:16:29,162 --> 00:16:32,663
- Yeah, of course.
- You take yours, I'll take mine.

145
00:16:33,769 --> 00:16:36,097
Hey, Stone. What's this?

146
00:16:36,472 --> 00:16:39,073
- Are you going on a picnic?
- What, pal?

147
00:16:39,276 --> 00:16:41,877
Having your own booze delivered now?

148
00:16:43,849 --> 00:16:47,254
- Don't touch it! Where did you get this?
- Somebody wheeled it in.

149
00:16:47,354 --> 00:16:49,419
- Who did?
- I don't know.

150
00:16:49,724 --> 00:16:52,291
Did anybody see who delivered this?

151
00:16:52,661 --> 00:16:54,159
Nobody?

152
00:16:54,497 --> 00:16:55,532
Don't.

153
00:16:55,632 --> 00:16:57,101
- It's cold.
- What?

154
00:16:57,201 --> 00:17:00,336
- Cold enough to be full of beers?
- What's going on?

155
00:17:06,045 --> 00:17:07,270
All right.

156
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,739
Open it.

157
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,003
Paranoid?

158
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:28,534
Seal off the building. Now!

159
00:17:30,176 --> 00:17:31,435
It's too late.

160
00:17:31,579 --> 00:17:35,419
Get Forensics on this.
I wanna know who delivered it and when.

161
00:17:35,761 --> 00:17:38,294
Durkin, stick with him.

162
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,698
I want a mold from these teeth imprints,
and I want them now!

163
00:17:48,579 --> 00:17:49,769
Hi.

164
00:17:51,015 --> 00:17:53,150
Can I ask you something?

165
00:17:53,452 --> 00:17:55,589
Where'd you get your training?

166
00:17:55,689 --> 00:17:59,227
I come from Lochgilphead in Argyll,
but we moved to Glasgow when I was 4.

167
00:17:59,327 --> 00:18:02,866
I got my first degree there,
then I did postgraduate in Edinburgh...

168
00:18:02,966 --> 00:18:06,658
and after I decided to join the police,
I went to Oxford.

169
00:18:08,938 --> 00:18:10,471
Stay there.

170
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:59,069
Don't move or I'll blow your head off.

171
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:01,403
What the hell are you doing here?

172
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:06,379
- I'm trying to think. Do you mind?
- You must be sick, laying in wet blood.

173
00:19:09,585 --> 00:19:13,383
You saw him, didn't you? I know you did.

174
00:19:14,225 --> 00:19:18,193
You can see him. I can see him.

175
00:19:18,631 --> 00:19:21,969
That also means I'm not crazy.

176
00:19:22,069 --> 00:19:23,635
What the hell are you doing?

177
00:19:28,344 --> 00:19:29,876
Excuse me.

178
00:19:30,313 --> 00:19:32,811
I was talking to your secretary.

179
00:19:39,426 --> 00:19:41,616
What the hell are you doing?

180
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:46,088
80 percent of all accidents
are caused by poor visibility.

181
00:19:48,804 --> 00:19:53,907
All units in the vicinity go to 227 Maple
to investigate a homicide.

182
00:19:54,913 --> 00:19:57,947
- Stone.
- Looks as though he's struck again.

183
00:19:58,316 --> 00:19:59,575
On my way.

184
00:20:01,487 --> 00:20:03,417
Follow me, Dick!

185
00:21:00,498 --> 00:21:01,859
Sorry.

186
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,652
- What floor?
- Fourth.

187
00:21:27,868 --> 00:21:29,730
- What's going on?
- ID, sir.

188
00:21:31,973 --> 00:21:34,073
Detective Dick Durkin.

189
00:21:38,314 --> 00:21:39,951
What have you got?

190
00:21:40,051 --> 00:21:42,584
What's left of a 28-year-old man.

191
00:21:43,655 --> 00:21:45,756
His heart's been torn out.

192
00:21:46,858 --> 00:21:49,028
What are you doing?
I thought you were suspended.

193
00:21:49,128 --> 00:21:52,526
I was. You got a time of death?

194
00:21:54,369 --> 00:21:57,406
It's a guess, but I'd place
the TOD somewhere around...

195
00:21:57,506 --> 00:21:59,676
- 6:30.
- Yes.

196
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,074
How do you know that?

197
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,602
Is it always like this?

198
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:26,774
It's always like this.

199
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,559
I hate rats.

200
00:22:39,997 --> 00:22:41,993
Sorry about the suit.

201
00:23:00,624 --> 00:23:01,916
Damn.

202
00:23:03,528 --> 00:23:05,127
What is it?

203
00:23:06,064 --> 00:23:07,629
It's a message for me.

204
00:23:08,033 --> 00:23:11,671
- How do you know it's for you?
- This is my partner's.

205
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:18,138
What is that?

206
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:22,715
Looks like an astrological symbol.

207
00:23:23,419 --> 00:23:26,714
It is. A symbol for Scorpio.

208
00:23:27,425 --> 00:23:31,687
Inverted triangle inside a circle,
that's using the occult.

209
00:23:32,032 --> 00:23:35,134
"25, 78." Don't know what that means.

210
00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:39,031
- Has he ever done this before?
- No.

211
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:42,445
I wonder if he stood
on the bed to paint it.

212
00:23:42,545 --> 00:23:44,818
If he did, he shouldn't
be too hard to find.

213
00:23:44,918 --> 00:23:45,910
Why?

214
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:49,110
He'd have to be 10 feet tall.

215
00:23:51,191 --> 00:23:54,360
- What do you know about the occult?
- Nothing.

216
00:23:54,761 --> 00:23:56,631
I thought you went to school.

217
00:23:56,731 --> 00:23:59,835
I did, but the occult
wasn't on the curriculum.

218
00:23:59,935 --> 00:24:02,296
What about this Scorpio stuff?

219
00:24:02,838 --> 00:24:04,734
Are you serious?

220
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:07,811
- You must read your horoscope.
- Why?

221
00:24:07,911 --> 00:24:10,274
Got a present for you, Stone.

222
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,652
Chief asked me to give you this.

223
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:16,090
It's the cast of the dentition,
from the heart this morning.

224
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:18,824
Take this to the lab
and have it checked.

225
00:24:19,227 --> 00:24:21,396
Now. You got a problem with that?

226
00:24:21,496 --> 00:24:25,691
Yeah, the same problem I got with you.
Who the fuck do you think you are?

227
00:24:26,602 --> 00:24:29,340
Bring this to the lab right now!
I don't have time for this!

228
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,280
Don't think everybody's not going
to hear about this because they are.

229
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:37,107
- What were you saying?
- A little tension between you two?

230
00:24:37,385 --> 00:24:38,984
Shut up.

231
00:24:44,247 --> 00:24:46,074
Go on.

232
00:25:16,655 --> 00:25:18,289
Show me your face!

233
00:25:24,868 --> 00:25:26,535
Foster!

234
00:25:30,074 --> 00:25:31,376
Freeze!

235
00:25:31,476 --> 00:25:33,736
He's a police officer! Back off!

236
00:25:34,146 --> 00:25:36,110
Back!

237
00:25:36,382 --> 00:25:37,674
Okay.

238
00:25:38,885 --> 00:25:40,553
What happened?

239
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,482
He's out here somewhere.

240
00:25:44,693 --> 00:25:48,421
- How do you know?
- I'm telling you, he's watching.

241
00:26:04,285 --> 00:26:06,419
Can I ask you a question?

242
00:26:09,391 --> 00:26:10,685
What?

243
00:26:11,262 --> 00:26:14,295
- What happened back there?
- We got close.

244
00:26:14,601 --> 00:26:17,361
- How do you know?
- That's two questions.

245
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:26,872
How do you know what time
the second victim was killed?

246
00:26:31,455 --> 00:26:33,749
Are you psychic or something?

247
00:26:34,425 --> 00:26:38,464
- Your fucking attitude is driving me nuts.
- Word is, you are nuts.

248
00:26:38,564 --> 00:26:39,765
I shouldn't have said that...

249
00:26:39,865 --> 00:26:43,297
but since we're working together,
it's best if we're honest.

250
00:26:44,538 --> 00:26:47,842
We're not working together
and I'm not nuts.

251
00:26:47,942 --> 00:26:49,508
Okay.

252
00:26:50,379 --> 00:26:54,210
Was it Paulsen that turned you in
for the report that got you suspended?

253
00:26:54,518 --> 00:26:57,017
It's just a rumor that I heard.

254
00:26:58,256 --> 00:26:59,947
Zip up, Dick.

255
00:27:06,067 --> 00:27:08,930
Are there any similarities
in the victims?

256
00:27:09,204 --> 00:27:12,810
You may not like me, but I'm good.
I have an Honors in Serial Homicide.

257
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:14,543
Terrific.

258
00:27:15,646 --> 00:27:19,317
I spent a year with Behavioral Science
Division studying serial killers...

259
00:27:19,417 --> 00:27:21,054
and another year with Interpol.

260
00:27:21,154 --> 00:27:24,552
I'm not some idiot
straight out of police school.

261
00:27:24,725 --> 00:27:27,416
Did you know Charles Manson
was a Scorpio?

262
00:27:33,537 --> 00:27:36,940
Before yesterday, I thought
we were dealing with a psychotic.

263
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:41,679
Then, after you told me about the hearts,
I was convinced he was a psychopath.

264
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:45,746
And seeing what he did,
I'd have to say he's both.

265
00:27:46,921 --> 00:27:49,419
A psychotic
with a psychopathic personality.

266
00:27:55,532 --> 00:27:57,569
There are no similarities
between the victims.

267
00:27:57,669 --> 00:28:00,939
- There has to be.
- This beast doesn't care what it kills.

268
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,675
Why do you call him a beast?

269
00:28:02,775 --> 00:28:05,137
What would you call something...

270
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,874
with teeth like this?

271
00:28:35,351 --> 00:28:37,781
- Give me your keys.
- What for?

272
00:28:38,088 --> 00:28:39,880
Give me your keys.

273
00:28:42,126 --> 00:28:44,592
A present from my girlfriend.

274
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:48,356
Where are we going?

275
00:28:49,271 --> 00:28:51,301
You're not going anywhere.

276
00:28:53,909 --> 00:28:55,736
That's not fair.

277
00:29:34,429 --> 00:29:35,891
Michelle?

278
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,595
No, King Kong.

279
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:44,572
- What are you doing here?
- Same as you.

280
00:29:47,045 --> 00:29:51,205
I come here every time I come to London.

281
00:29:55,757 --> 00:29:57,619
I just called you.

282
00:29:58,294 --> 00:29:59,860
You did?

283
00:30:02,199 --> 00:30:05,036
Your answering machine
wasn't working so I...

284
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,633
Hung up.

285
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:14,805
- You look very pretty.
- You look like shit.

286
00:30:17,418 --> 00:30:18,711
Thanks.

287
00:30:19,922 --> 00:30:22,989
When was the last time
you got some sleep?

288
00:30:24,662 --> 00:30:26,694
Maybe four days ago.

289
00:30:29,235 --> 00:30:33,201
His killer is still around
and I don't know if I can get him.

290
00:30:34,508 --> 00:30:37,542
Then don't try.
Just give it up and walk away.

291
00:30:40,416 --> 00:30:42,017
I can't.

292
00:30:45,823 --> 00:30:48,287
How about just for the night?

293
00:30:56,136 --> 00:30:58,237
Better watch your coat.

294
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,301
I've got a lot of greasy stuff.

295
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:19,657
- Is there a light?
- Right in front of you.

296
00:31:26,745 --> 00:31:28,970
No wonder I couldn't find you.

297
00:31:29,247 --> 00:31:31,284
Were you looking for me?

298
00:31:31,384 --> 00:31:33,676
Yes, I was looking for you.

299
00:31:33,886 --> 00:31:36,554
Could we open a window?

300
00:31:40,962 --> 00:31:42,755
Get out of here.

301
00:31:44,099 --> 00:31:46,063
Windows are broken.

302
00:31:47,371 --> 00:31:49,334
I can open that door.

303
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:53,841
Thanks. That's a little better.

304
00:32:00,054 --> 00:32:02,223
I'm sorry I disappeared.

305
00:32:02,323 --> 00:32:04,559
It wasn't your fault
any more than it was mine.

306
00:32:04,659 --> 00:32:07,124
That's just the way it happened.

307
00:32:17,344 --> 00:32:20,537
When was the last time
you cleaned this place?

308
00:32:20,714 --> 00:32:22,543
I don't remember.

309
00:32:24,453 --> 00:32:26,519
It's good to see you.

310
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:29,623
I hear that you were suspended.

311
00:32:30,194 --> 00:32:32,022
Word gets around.

312
00:32:32,197 --> 00:32:35,526
No, Paulsen called.
He and Foster were close.

313
00:32:37,636 --> 00:32:39,862
You still on the wagon?

314
00:32:41,708 --> 00:32:43,433
- Yeah.
- Good.

315
00:32:45,913 --> 00:32:48,040
I just brought one of the kids
from Newcastle.

316
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,876
- You've got kids now?
- No, I work with children.

317
00:32:50,976 --> 00:32:54,476
There's a lot of kids
that need psychological help.

318
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:57,741
That's really nice.

319
00:32:59,889 --> 00:33:02,319
- Yeah.
- Sorry about the pigeons.

320
00:33:02,858 --> 00:33:04,754
I can't kill 'em.

321
00:33:08,267 --> 00:33:10,128
How's Foster's mom?

322
00:33:11,637 --> 00:33:13,031
The same.

323
00:33:13,974 --> 00:33:17,143
- I don't think she'll ever get over it.
- Yes.

324
00:33:19,514 --> 00:33:21,146
How are you?

325
00:33:22,151 --> 00:33:23,841
Me? I'm crazy as ever.

326
00:33:27,458 --> 00:33:29,023
I miss him.

327
00:33:33,165 --> 00:33:34,594
I miss him, too.

328
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:39,439
I'll make some coffee.

329
00:33:40,875 --> 00:33:42,703
Don't you have any real food?

330
00:34:48,065 --> 00:34:50,028
It's midnight. Tide's coming up.

331
00:34:51,769 --> 00:34:55,269
- Come on.
- Let's go get a beer. There's nothing here.

332
00:35:03,918 --> 00:35:06,417
Foster?

333
00:35:19,105 --> 00:35:20,932
Come on.

334
00:35:59,224 --> 00:36:01,723
Durkin, you're sick.

335
00:37:32,013 --> 00:37:33,511
Freeze!

336
00:37:33,716 --> 00:37:34,974
You want breakfast?

337
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,808
No.

338
00:37:38,221 --> 00:37:39,979
Fine, I'll drive.

339
00:37:44,162 --> 00:37:45,352
Hop in.

340
00:37:55,777 --> 00:37:59,148
Are you telling me you guys
from Oxford don't eat breakfast?

341
00:37:59,248 --> 00:38:01,610
Yeah, right after I run.

342
00:38:02,587 --> 00:38:04,056
- You what?
- Run.

343
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:06,324
Five miles every morning.

344
00:38:06,693 --> 00:38:10,385
- What's the matter, you don't get laid?
- Yeah, every night.

345
00:38:12,233 --> 00:38:15,871
You get laid every night,
and you run five miles every morning?

346
00:38:15,971 --> 00:38:18,140
Yeah. Except Sundays.

347
00:38:18,475 --> 00:38:23,010
My girlfriend and I stay in bed
and fool around.

348
00:38:26,185 --> 00:38:28,286
That's disgusting.

349
00:38:29,589 --> 00:38:31,121
What is it?

350
00:38:32,525 --> 00:38:34,695
Nothing. I need coffee.

351
00:38:55,824 --> 00:38:57,549
What's this?

352
00:38:58,027 --> 00:39:01,960
Books: paranormal psychology,
astrology, the occult.

353
00:39:02,432 --> 00:39:06,125
- You read them all?
- Last night, after sex.

354
00:39:09,543 --> 00:39:11,142
Do you mind?

355
00:39:11,443 --> 00:39:13,748
You smoke too much,
drink too much coffee...

356
00:39:13,848 --> 00:39:16,417
- ... and eat too much sugar.
- Helps ease the tension.

357
00:39:16,517 --> 00:39:19,915
I can get rid of that.
Massage is one of my hobbies.

358
00:39:20,924 --> 00:39:24,462
That's it. Now, just relax.
Let the tension flow.

359
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:28,699
Listen, pal,
touching me is not a great idea.

360
00:39:29,768 --> 00:39:31,630
We're cops, okay?

361
00:40:10,355 --> 00:40:12,421
- How's it going?
- Good.

362
00:40:13,959 --> 00:40:16,857
Get me some breakfast, coffee.

363
00:40:20,936 --> 00:40:24,594
Could I have a Lapsang Souchong
and a croissant, please?

364
00:40:28,445 --> 00:40:31,706
You know, I think you have
supernatural powers.

365
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:37,656
- You read that in one of your books?
- Yeah.

366
00:40:38,091 --> 00:40:42,826
In the Black Masque.
I collect them, it is one of my hobbies.

367
00:40:42,926 --> 00:40:46,998
- Do you have any hobbies?
- Not since I gave up drinking.

368
00:40:47,098 --> 00:40:49,164
You quit drinking? Good for you.

369
00:40:50,403 --> 00:40:53,595
What is it about you
that reminds me of my mom?

370
00:40:53,841 --> 00:40:55,309
Maybe because I'm so charming.

371
00:40:55,409 --> 00:40:59,067
My mom was a lot of things,
she was not charming.

372
00:41:03,185 --> 00:41:05,877
- God, I love this job.
- Interested?

373
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:29,345
It's really good.

374
00:41:29,454 --> 00:41:31,857
I hear you used to be a good cop.
My croissant?

375
00:41:31,957 --> 00:41:34,250
What else? You got some salt?

376
00:41:34,361 --> 00:41:36,586
Then you went a bit loopy.

377
00:41:37,765 --> 00:41:40,024
That could be why you're psychic.

378
00:41:40,502 --> 00:41:42,271
I just feel things, that's all.

379
00:41:42,371 --> 00:41:44,972
I hate to break the news,
but that's what psychic is.

380
00:42:04,065 --> 00:42:07,202
I think you and this killer
are on the same psychic wavelength.

381
00:42:07,302 --> 00:42:09,631
What sign were you born under?

382
00:42:10,675 --> 00:42:13,177
- I don't remember.
- Come on. When's your birthday?

383
00:42:13,277 --> 00:42:15,814
- November 10.
- You're a Scorpio.

384
00:42:15,914 --> 00:42:19,347
- So what?
- That's the sign he drew on the ceiling.

385
00:42:35,907 --> 00:42:38,441
You ever asked yourself
why he sent you the heart?

386
00:42:43,084 --> 00:42:45,753
Maybe it's because he thinks
you lack compassion.

387
00:42:45,853 --> 00:42:47,248
Are you trying to be funny?

388
00:42:57,168 --> 00:42:58,528
Great!

389
00:43:01,174 --> 00:43:03,308
I've been wondering...

390
00:43:05,314 --> 00:43:08,245
why he only kills during the high tide.

391
00:43:08,785 --> 00:43:11,021
I'll bet it has something
to do with the...

392
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:16,384
astrological alignment of the stars
in conjunction with the new moon.

393
00:43:18,665 --> 00:43:20,856
Scorpio is a water sign.

394
00:43:21,435 --> 00:43:23,672
The highest tide pulls in the new moon.

395
00:43:23,772 --> 00:43:27,475
That's just off the top of my head.
You probably have a better idea.

396
00:43:27,575 --> 00:43:29,175
No, I don't.

397
00:43:36,854 --> 00:43:39,892
He shows up every month
on the night of the new moon...

398
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:43,219
he kills before midnight,
in different locations...

399
00:43:43,697 --> 00:43:45,967
then he disappears.
We don't have a motive.

400
00:43:46,067 --> 00:43:48,503
- We don't have a pattern.
- Slow down.

401
00:43:48,603 --> 00:43:52,261
The only thing we know for sure
is that he's not a vegetarian.

402
00:43:58,918 --> 00:44:00,345
Stone?

403
00:44:02,722 --> 00:44:06,621
Okay, dipshit, your turn.
What do you make of all this?

404
00:44:12,635 --> 00:44:15,861
I don't care about your degrees
or secondhand knowledge.

405
00:44:16,006 --> 00:44:19,005
I want to know what you think. You.

406
00:44:19,911 --> 00:44:23,717
Any units in the area, report.
There's an intruder at 16 Roselle Street.

407
00:44:23,817 --> 00:44:25,814
- That's...
- My place.

408
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:36,593
My shotgun.

409
00:44:37,667 --> 00:44:39,460
Call for backup. Now!

410
00:44:51,319 --> 00:44:52,781
Michelle?

411
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:26,795
Where is he?

412
00:45:29,035 --> 00:45:31,205
If this is a joke,
I don't think it's funny.

413
00:45:31,305 --> 00:45:34,208
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking a shower.

414
00:45:34,308 --> 00:45:35,811
- You're taking a shower?
- Yes.

415
00:45:35,911 --> 00:45:39,149
- I heard screaming.
- The water got colder!

416
00:45:39,249 --> 00:45:42,283
- The door is open.
- I didn't open it.

417
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:47,987
Lock it!

418
00:45:53,802 --> 00:45:55,972
- What are you doing?
- They're on their way.

419
00:45:56,072 --> 00:45:57,569
She's okay.

420
00:46:14,595 --> 00:46:16,024
Get back here!

421
00:46:28,747 --> 00:46:30,575
Stupid son of a bitch!

422
00:47:33,567 --> 00:47:36,601
I'd better find Durkin.

423
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:41,572
Stone! For Christ's sake!

424
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,717
- It bit me!
- Don't worry about it.

425
00:47:46,817 --> 00:47:49,077
- What?
- I'll get the medics.

426
00:47:49,988 --> 00:47:51,883
Come on, move back!

427
00:48:16,322 --> 00:48:19,595
Her chest was ripped open.
He must have used a hatchet.

428
00:48:19,695 --> 00:48:22,626
No, he used his hands.

429
00:48:40,387 --> 00:48:42,022
You saw him, didn't you?

430
00:49:03,017 --> 00:49:05,413
The guy's hyperventilating.

431
00:49:06,489 --> 00:49:08,282
Okay, come on.

432
00:49:10,027 --> 00:49:12,398
I'm okay. Need some fresh air.

433
00:49:12,498 --> 00:49:14,029
Give him space.

434
00:49:17,337 --> 00:49:20,029
Just calm down. Breathe in deep.

435
00:49:20,307 --> 00:49:22,168
Easy, fella.

436
00:49:37,595 --> 00:49:40,168
Hey, Harley!

437
00:49:47,178 --> 00:49:48,571
Foster?

438
00:49:59,795 --> 00:50:01,485
Jesus!

439
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:04,962
Foster? Come on, pal.

440
00:50:17,284 --> 00:50:20,353
- Jesus.
- Stone, are you all right?

441
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:22,918
Dick.

442
00:50:25,095 --> 00:50:28,399
- What are you doing here?
- No wonder you have panic attacks.

443
00:50:28,499 --> 00:50:32,604
- That's it! That's your psychic connection.
- You're supposed to be dead.

444
00:50:32,704 --> 00:50:37,171
You've never heard of a bulletproof vest?
Man, watch out. Right.

445
00:50:38,847 --> 00:50:41,481
Don't you ask me why I did that.

446
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:54,723
- You'll be okay.
- Yeah, I'll be fine.

447
00:50:56,971 --> 00:50:59,162
Did you see anything?

448
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:04,579
No, I saw a flash and then I felt the pain,
but that's all I remember.

449
00:51:07,718 --> 00:51:10,752
Michelle, I'd like a word
with you, please.

450
00:51:11,889 --> 00:51:14,115
Catch up with you later.

451
00:51:31,849 --> 00:51:35,178
I'm sorry, it's my lighter.

452
00:51:48,372 --> 00:51:51,632
- Where's the report from the lab?
- On your desk.

453
00:51:52,143 --> 00:51:55,212
- What did you find out?
- Read the report.

454
00:51:55,447 --> 00:51:57,308
What did you find out?

455
00:51:57,984 --> 00:52:00,675
Traces of Leptospira interrogans.

456
00:52:01,888 --> 00:52:02,825
What?

457
00:52:02,925 --> 00:52:06,493
That's the rat virus
that causes Weil's disease.

458
00:52:07,363 --> 00:52:09,466
- Any fingerprints?
- Just one set.

459
00:52:09,566 --> 00:52:11,001
- Did you bring them in?
- No.

460
00:52:11,101 --> 00:52:13,998
- Why not?
- Because they were Foster's.

461
00:52:14,573 --> 00:52:17,901
Your old partner, my best friend.
Do you remember him?

462
00:52:19,779 --> 00:52:21,315
Get your fucking hands off me.

463
00:52:21,415 --> 00:52:24,819
You want to tell me
why you turned me in for a medical?

464
00:52:24,919 --> 00:52:27,490
- You really want to know?
- Tell me.

465
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:30,527
Not because you caused
the death of your best friend...

466
00:52:30,627 --> 00:52:34,666
not because you ran away with his wife,
not because you then dumped her...

467
00:52:34,766 --> 00:52:36,870
but because you're past it.

468
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:39,539
You're a liability.
You're a fucking menace!

469
00:52:39,639 --> 00:52:41,330
Get your hands off him!

470
00:52:42,042 --> 00:52:43,436
Relax.

471
00:52:44,546 --> 00:52:46,543
Get in my office. Now!

472
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:57,863
You know what I just heard?

473
00:52:57,963 --> 00:53:02,498
You came face to face with the killer
and unloaded a full clip at him.

474
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:08,041
The word is you missed.

475
00:53:08,410 --> 00:53:11,748
- Do you know me to miss?
- You saying you hit him?

476
00:53:11,848 --> 00:53:16,021
- I didn't miss. That's what I'm saying.
- Then why the fuck isn't he dead?

477
00:53:16,121 --> 00:53:21,056
I unloaded a full clip,
450 Magnum, point blank.

478
00:53:21,862 --> 00:53:24,860
It disappeared. Vanished in front of me.

479
00:53:25,365 --> 00:53:28,296
You are telling me
this guy is superhuman?

480
00:53:28,436 --> 00:53:32,836
I don't know what he is,
sure as hell ain't like you or me.

481
00:53:33,309 --> 00:53:34,378
What is it?

482
00:53:34,478 --> 00:53:36,881
Genetic fingerprints
have come back from the lab.

483
00:53:36,981 --> 00:53:39,081
I think you should see this.

484
00:53:42,355 --> 00:53:43,957
What the hell is this?

485
00:53:44,057 --> 00:53:47,395
Multiple restriction,
polymorphic DNA sequences.

486
00:53:47,495 --> 00:53:48,563
Bullshit.

487
00:53:48,663 --> 00:53:51,890
It has the DNA structure
of all its victims.

488
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:55,997
It says here it's got rat DNA.

489
00:53:57,975 --> 00:54:00,075
It's got your DNA, too.

490
00:54:01,913 --> 00:54:04,350
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

491
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:07,120
- Durkin, stick with him.
- Yes, sir.

492
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:09,754
- And, Durkin...
- Sir?

493
00:54:10,092 --> 00:54:11,782
Watch your ass.

494
00:54:36,593 --> 00:54:40,132
If it makes you feel any better,
those DNA reports can be wrong.

495
00:54:40,232 --> 00:54:41,955
Yeah, right.

496
00:54:42,534 --> 00:54:44,703
He didn't get her heart.

497
00:54:51,712 --> 00:54:53,541
What did you say?

498
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:56,782
The last victim's heart,
he didn't get it.

499
00:54:58,355 --> 00:55:01,082
That means it's going to come back.

500
00:55:05,532 --> 00:55:07,393
Are you ready to die?

501
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:08,790
What?

502
00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:11,434
The morgue. Come on!

503
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:15,144
Get lost!

504
00:55:15,244 --> 00:55:17,174
Excuse me!

505
00:55:18,715 --> 00:55:21,008
Out of my way, you fucks!

506
00:55:27,961 --> 00:55:29,685
He's in there.

507
00:55:51,024 --> 00:55:52,852
I'll wait outside.

508
00:55:53,661 --> 00:55:55,887
Didn't think you'd buy that.

509
00:56:18,127 --> 00:56:19,954
I don't like this.

510
00:56:58,714 --> 00:57:00,940
Don't move or you're dead!

511
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:06,415
- What are you eating?
- He works here.

512
00:57:12,365 --> 00:57:14,328
- Oxford?
- Yes.

513
00:57:15,368 --> 00:57:16,730
Sorry.

514
00:57:17,671 --> 00:57:19,099
Anytime.

515
00:57:32,392 --> 00:57:33,888
What?

516
00:57:37,231 --> 00:57:38,420
Up there.

517
00:57:39,834 --> 00:57:41,662
I'll be damned.

518
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:46,366
What's going on here?

519
00:57:59,152 --> 00:58:02,618
- What do you think?
- I think he's gone.

520
00:58:02,924 --> 00:58:04,523
Yeah, right.

521
00:58:09,233 --> 00:58:10,798
You got him!

522
00:58:14,572 --> 00:58:16,364
I know I hit him.

523
00:58:48,951 --> 00:58:51,121
We need bigger guns, Stone.

524
00:58:51,221 --> 00:58:53,117
That's quite a hole.

525
00:58:53,223 --> 00:58:55,560
- Did you get to see him?
- Him?

526
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:58,364
That wasn't a "him."
That was a fucking "it"!

527
00:58:58,464 --> 00:59:02,658
- We've got to get bigger guns!
- Take a deep breath. Relax.

528
00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:05,099
Okay. Come on.

529
00:59:13,117 --> 00:59:17,188
We need bigger guns, big fucking guns!

530
00:59:18,057 --> 00:59:19,417
Sorry.

531
00:59:20,393 --> 00:59:23,898
We're getting big guns, right?
That's where we're going, to get big guns.

532
00:59:23,998 --> 00:59:27,794
Stone, we need some big fucking guns!

533
00:59:29,973 --> 00:59:33,234
- Another one.
- Did you see his eyes?

534
00:59:33,511 --> 00:59:36,408
All I saw was this...

535
00:59:36,681 --> 00:59:38,042
Drink.

536
00:59:40,486 --> 00:59:42,950
...huge fucking thing.

537
00:59:45,258 --> 00:59:46,984
How are you feeling?

538
00:59:47,195 --> 00:59:49,830
- You okay?
- Yeah.

539
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,601
How?

540
00:59:52,701 --> 00:59:55,201
- I feel...
- On edge?

541
00:59:55,372 --> 00:59:57,007
- Yeah.
- Good.

542
00:59:57,875 --> 00:59:59,736
Have one of these.

543
01:00:05,453 --> 01:00:08,952
- You really get laid every night?
- Yeah!

544
01:00:11,694 --> 01:00:13,157
Now what?

545
01:00:16,667 --> 01:00:19,063
We're going to get bigger guns.

546
01:00:21,841 --> 01:00:23,475
Hallelujah.

547
01:00:28,116 --> 01:00:31,775
A-3, high-powered semiautomatic.

548
01:00:32,355 --> 01:00:34,591
- Something bigger.
- What?

549
01:00:34,691 --> 01:00:36,293
Does the Chief know you're down here?

550
01:00:36,393 --> 01:00:39,797
We need big guns. Big fucking guns.

551
01:00:39,897 --> 01:00:41,801
What the hell's he on?

552
01:00:41,901 --> 01:00:44,171
- Chocolate.
- Chocolate?

553
01:00:44,271 --> 01:00:48,074
I want a grenade launcher.
High-capacity 90mm, automatic.

554
01:00:48,174 --> 01:00:50,104
- Right.
- SA80.

555
01:00:50,611 --> 01:00:52,747
These are too fucking small!

556
01:00:58,389 --> 01:01:01,752
No. That's an assault shotgun,
fully automatic.

557
01:01:02,261 --> 01:01:05,454
Listen, that fires 650 rounds a minute.

558
01:01:06,834 --> 01:01:08,636
What do you need two for?

559
01:01:08,736 --> 01:01:11,770
What the fuck is this thing
you're after, a German tank?

560
01:01:12,909 --> 01:01:15,279
No, that's a Megatron flash grenade.

561
01:01:15,379 --> 01:01:17,979
You could clear the jungle
with one of these things.

562
01:01:21,653 --> 01:01:23,685
Bingo! Let's go!

563
01:01:26,692 --> 01:01:30,125
Right. I was wondering
if one of you guys would sign...

564
01:01:31,232 --> 01:01:34,670
This thing, it's like the sum total
of every serial killer I've studied.

565
01:01:34,770 --> 01:01:38,140
A single organism made up
of multiple DNA structures.

566
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:42,580
It's as if someone took every serial killer,
and rolled it into one incredible being.

567
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:45,684
What are you doing with those things?
Who authorized this?

568
01:01:45,784 --> 01:01:46,854
Shit!

569
01:01:46,954 --> 01:01:49,858
- Why didn't I think of that before?
- What?

570
01:01:49,958 --> 01:01:53,362
"25, 78." 25th year, 78th cycle.

571
01:01:53,462 --> 01:01:56,566
The Chinese calendar.
2008, now, this year.

572
01:01:56,666 --> 01:01:59,503
- What are you on about?
- 2008 is the year.

573
01:01:59,603 --> 01:02:02,040
- Of the rat!
- What the hell are you talking about?

574
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:05,210
The inverted triangle
is not only a symbol of evil...

575
01:02:05,310 --> 01:02:06,845
it also represents water.

576
01:02:06,945 --> 01:02:09,482
What have you done to him?
He's sounding like you.

577
01:02:09,582 --> 01:02:12,654
- What about the circle?
- Circle is the sign of magic and power.

578
01:02:12,754 --> 01:02:15,458
Everything inside the circle
is protected from the outside.

579
01:02:15,558 --> 01:02:17,058
Hello!

580
01:02:17,158 --> 01:02:19,862
Will somebody please tell me
what the hell's going on here?

581
01:02:19,962 --> 01:02:23,067
Scorpio is the sign most susceptible
to the powers of darkness.

582
01:02:23,167 --> 01:02:25,036
To Scorpio, the idea of being joined...

583
01:02:25,136 --> 01:02:27,473
with a supernatural being
is very important.

584
01:02:27,573 --> 01:02:30,277
And the most powerful
supernatural being... Satan!

585
01:02:30,377 --> 01:02:31,945
What are you on about?

586
01:02:32,045 --> 01:02:35,049
When chaos reigns,
then will the Fallen Angel prevail.

587
01:02:35,149 --> 01:02:38,053
- What the fuck is he talking about?
- Look around!

588
01:02:38,153 --> 01:02:41,759
- The world's in chaos!
- I don't believe this shit!

589
01:02:41,859 --> 01:02:44,462
He's eating human hearts,
for Christ's sake.

590
01:02:44,562 --> 01:02:46,966
- How do you know?
- We had lunch with him.

591
01:02:47,066 --> 01:02:49,636
Cannibals ate hearts
to gain possession of souls.

592
01:02:49,736 --> 01:02:52,072
It believes that if it eats
its victims' hearts...

593
01:02:52,172 --> 01:02:55,476
it not only gains their power
and their DNA...

594
01:02:55,576 --> 01:02:57,938
it also gains their souls.

595
01:02:58,213 --> 01:03:01,751
Are you telling me there's something
running loose in this city...

596
01:03:01,851 --> 01:03:06,956
ripping out and eating people's hearts
so he can take their souls back to hell?

597
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:10,185
Looks that way.

598
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:13,196
Hallelujah.

599
01:03:14,067 --> 01:03:16,293
You're both fucking nuts.

600
01:03:17,672 --> 01:03:19,174
What am I supposed to do?

601
01:03:19,274 --> 01:03:23,179
Put out an APB on some fucking guy
who looks like the devil?

602
01:03:23,279 --> 01:03:26,417
Answers to the name of Lucifer?
Yeah, and you!

603
01:03:26,517 --> 01:03:29,456
I suppose he's got two fucking horns
sticking out of his head!

604
01:03:29,556 --> 01:03:33,055
Yeah, and a fucking tail!
Fucking get out of the way!

605
01:03:33,794 --> 01:03:36,964
Jesus Christ! The pair of pricks!

606
01:03:46,878 --> 01:03:48,272
Coffee?

607
01:03:51,616 --> 01:03:53,683
This place is amazing.

608
01:03:57,058 --> 01:03:58,588
Great bike.

609
01:04:00,062 --> 01:04:01,752
Do you want some...

610
01:04:03,899 --> 01:04:05,500
coffee?

611
01:04:05,702 --> 01:04:06,960
Yes, please.

612
01:04:11,209 --> 01:04:13,036
What have we got?

613
01:04:13,445 --> 01:04:15,416
We don't have anything.

614
01:04:15,516 --> 01:04:18,776
We're not chasing it, it's chasing us.

615
01:04:20,054 --> 01:04:21,984
- Milk?
- Just a drop.

616
01:04:32,572 --> 01:04:33,932
Don't.

617
01:04:41,081 --> 01:04:45,879
This thing has really started
to piss me off.

618
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:56,931
I think you need a plumber.

619
01:05:03,444 --> 01:05:05,272
I'll cover you.

620
01:05:12,357 --> 01:05:15,925
Michelle, what are you doing here?

621
01:05:19,866 --> 01:05:22,399
In the fridge, I touched it.

622
01:05:22,637 --> 01:05:24,707
It's all right. It's okay.

623
01:05:24,807 --> 01:05:27,272
The door was open, so I came in.

624
01:05:27,476 --> 01:05:30,840
So you're back now.
Everything's going to be fine.

625
01:05:32,650 --> 01:05:34,375
What happened?

626
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:38,419
Foster's mother killed herself.

627
01:05:40,394 --> 01:05:42,858
- I'm sorry.
- Excuse me.

628
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:51,870
Stay there.

629
01:05:56,447 --> 01:05:59,284
The bite on her shoulder
means he's promised to it.

630
01:05:59,384 --> 01:06:01,454
- He's got her DNA, too?
- Yeah.

631
01:06:01,554 --> 01:06:02,948
Harley.

632
01:06:04,025 --> 01:06:07,890
"Harley." I'm working
with a guy called Harley.

633
01:06:08,431 --> 01:06:10,599
You think that's funny?

634
01:06:16,207 --> 01:06:18,842
What's so great about Dick Durkin?

635
01:06:21,848 --> 01:06:23,949
Go sit in the car.

636
01:06:24,152 --> 01:06:26,148
Call me on the radio.

637
01:06:40,035 --> 01:06:44,673
Which hand did you use? This one?

638
01:06:49,882 --> 01:06:52,142
He's after me now, isn't he?

639
01:06:53,522 --> 01:06:54,779
No.

640
01:06:57,425 --> 01:06:59,526
He's getting desperate.

641
01:07:00,496 --> 01:07:02,221
So am I.

642
01:07:05,469 --> 01:07:06,762
Come.

643
01:07:25,862 --> 01:07:27,190
Stone.

644
01:07:31,703 --> 01:07:33,706
Stone here. Come in.

645
01:07:33,806 --> 01:07:36,009
There's something moving
at the end of the street.

646
01:07:36,109 --> 01:07:39,514
- What is it?
- I'm just going to investigate.

647
01:07:39,614 --> 01:07:42,718
I don't know. I'd better take a look.

648
01:07:43,853 --> 01:07:45,282
One sec.

649
01:07:57,404 --> 01:07:59,095
Oxford, come in.

650
01:08:06,984 --> 01:08:08,915
Durkin, come in.

651
01:08:11,054 --> 01:08:12,723
What's wrong?

652
01:08:13,292 --> 01:08:16,223
I don't know. Durkin's jeep's gone.

653
01:08:17,030 --> 01:08:19,134
I'd better go take a look.

654
01:08:19,234 --> 01:08:24,140
You stay here on the couch.
Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.

655
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:27,705
Something goes wrong, take this.

656
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:35,549
All right?

657
01:09:32,262 --> 01:09:34,294
Dick, come in.

658
01:09:43,678 --> 01:09:45,209
Having fun?

659
01:10:18,557 --> 01:10:19,747
Harley!

660
01:10:26,133 --> 01:10:27,597
Durkin!

661
01:10:37,549 --> 01:10:39,513
Stone!

662
01:10:39,884 --> 01:10:41,518
Yeah, hang on.

663
01:10:42,054 --> 01:10:43,484
Got you.

664
01:10:43,924 --> 01:10:46,252
Get me out of here!

665
01:10:54,438 --> 01:10:58,664
What happened?
I was looking for you. You okay?

666
01:10:59,511 --> 01:11:02,146
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Good.

667
01:11:02,247 --> 01:11:04,108
Didn't even see it.

668
01:11:05,452 --> 01:11:07,315
What's it done to me?

669
01:11:08,590 --> 01:11:13,320
I'm going to kill that fucker. I'm going
to find it, and I'm going to kill it.

670
01:11:37,327 --> 01:11:38,927
Rat bastard!

671
01:12:03,428 --> 01:12:04,858
Michelle?

672
01:12:18,315 --> 01:12:20,143
What are you doing?

673
01:12:20,484 --> 01:12:23,279
There was a rat, so I shot it.

674
01:12:24,056 --> 01:12:26,657
You shot my kitchen, that's what.

675
01:12:27,126 --> 01:12:28,954
I missed the rat.

676
01:12:30,764 --> 01:12:32,556
What? This one?

677
01:12:33,468 --> 01:12:34,760
Cool.

678
01:12:37,606 --> 01:12:39,296
I'm bleeding.

679
01:12:44,015 --> 01:12:47,619
Come on, pal, wake up. Get back to work.

680
01:12:47,719 --> 01:12:50,185
What? What are you doing?

681
01:12:52,761 --> 01:12:54,622
What's it done to me?

682
01:12:55,897 --> 01:12:58,498
See, this is his symbol.

683
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:01,702
We've been looking for a meaning.

684
01:13:01,972 --> 01:13:04,573
What if the symbol is just a map?

685
01:13:05,343 --> 01:13:06,646
A map?

686
01:13:06,746 --> 01:13:08,641
Give me that mirror.

687
01:13:09,807 --> 01:13:11,869
Give me the mirror.

688
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:16,683
Fuck!

689
01:13:17,092 --> 01:13:21,559
There's a circle, a triangle,
a Scorpio sign.

690
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:26,026
- The sting in the tail.
- Let me see.

691
01:13:26,371 --> 01:13:29,063
The tail points into the River Thames.

692
01:13:29,842 --> 01:13:31,067
Doesn't make sense.

693
01:13:34,214 --> 01:13:36,746
It's pointing to Cannon Street.

694
01:13:37,519 --> 01:13:39,589
That's where Foster was killed.

695
01:13:39,689 --> 01:13:42,357
It's taking you back.
It's completing the circle.

696
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:46,115
If he's there, Michelle's there.

697
01:13:47,484 --> 01:13:48,652
Geometrically speaking...

698
01:13:48,752 --> 01:13:51,791
once he kills you,
he's completed his pattern.

699
01:13:51,891 --> 01:13:53,992
Durkin, come on.

700
01:13:54,092 --> 01:13:57,964
Cannon Street Station hasn't been used
in years. It got submerged.

701
01:13:58,064 --> 01:14:01,792
I know a guy who can get us in
who lives here.

702
01:14:02,204 --> 01:14:04,031
What, is he crazy?

703
01:14:06,109 --> 01:14:09,041
You'll like him,
he catches rats for a living.

704
01:14:10,214 --> 01:14:11,938
He missed some.

705
01:14:12,751 --> 01:14:15,010
Open up! Police!

706
01:14:18,525 --> 01:14:20,521
Where's the big guy?

707
01:14:23,932 --> 01:14:26,623
Are there any lights in this place?

708
01:14:27,736 --> 01:14:31,032
- I think we're below the water table.
- I know.

709
01:14:31,275 --> 01:14:33,705
I just thought I'd mention it.

710
01:14:36,549 --> 01:14:38,478
Where's your boss?

711
01:14:48,498 --> 01:14:50,601
- Who's the guy?
- What guy?

712
01:14:50,701 --> 01:14:52,437
You know it's 4:00 in the morning?

713
01:14:52,537 --> 01:14:56,541
- We want to get to Cannon Street, fast.
- You can't go there. It's closed off.

714
01:14:56,641 --> 01:15:00,506
- Can you get us down there?
- You're really serious about this.

715
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:05,048
- Got any cash?
- No, just credit cards.

716
01:15:05,386 --> 01:15:07,611
Give me your watch.

717
01:15:08,657 --> 01:15:11,019
This serious enough for you?

718
01:15:12,694 --> 01:15:16,060
The exits and entrances
are all blocked off.

719
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:20,237
We sent a couple of guys
down there a few years ago.

720
01:15:20,339 --> 01:15:23,942
- What happened to them?
- They didn't come back, I guess.

721
01:15:25,879 --> 01:15:27,742
Can you get us in?

722
01:15:28,017 --> 01:15:31,020
- You don't want to go there.
- Yes, we do.

723
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:33,017
- No, you don't.
- Yes, we do.

724
01:15:34,225 --> 01:15:36,758
- No, you don't.
- Yes, we do.

725
01:15:37,262 --> 01:15:40,125
- Boy, are you pushy.
- Give me the watch.

726
01:15:40,433 --> 01:15:43,796
You're not going to need time
where you're going.

727
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:07,490
Get it off me.

728
01:16:07,601 --> 01:16:09,036
I hate rats.

729
01:16:09,136 --> 01:16:11,533
They love you.

730
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:20,349
Strange boy.

731
01:16:20,852 --> 01:16:22,987
He gets laid every night.

732
01:16:26,728 --> 01:16:28,530
This is my little door.

733
01:16:28,630 --> 01:16:31,099
Nobody knows about this, Stone,
except you.

734
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:34,928
So don't tell anybody.
This is to my den.

735
01:16:35,138 --> 01:16:36,703
This is the loo.

736
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:38,805
This is it.

737
01:16:50,424 --> 01:16:52,924
Where does he find these people?

738
01:16:57,199 --> 01:16:59,027
Hurry up, Durkin.

739
01:17:01,139 --> 01:17:04,504
We're definitely below
the water table now.

740
01:17:04,777 --> 01:17:06,570
He's down here.

741
01:17:08,949 --> 01:17:11,277
This is as far as I go, guys.

742
01:17:11,887 --> 01:17:14,352
Do we need any of those keys?

743
01:17:18,962 --> 01:17:20,629
Get the keys.

744
01:17:21,065 --> 01:17:23,826
- Thanks.
- I wish you well, guys.

745
01:17:30,378 --> 01:17:31,737
Come on.

746
01:17:36,185 --> 01:17:40,490
If I were a religious human being,
and not the reasoning person I think I am...

747
01:17:40,590 --> 01:17:44,028
I wouldn't say this thing
thinks it's Satan, I'd say it is Satan.

748
01:17:44,128 --> 01:17:46,797
Satan is in deep shit.

749
01:18:20,743 --> 01:18:23,469
- Do you want a Rah Rah?
- No, come on.

750
01:18:28,454 --> 01:18:30,383
I hate this place!

751
01:18:32,193 --> 01:18:34,796
"Master of light,
protect us from this evil plight.

752
01:18:34,896 --> 01:18:39,168
"For lowly lives, I take my fight,
Black Masque power.

753
01:18:39,268 --> 01:18:40,800
"The rights of might..."

754
01:18:55,490 --> 01:18:58,626
Don't do that again. It's not funny.

755
01:19:08,807 --> 01:19:11,671
It's out here somewhere. I can smell it.

756
01:19:24,962 --> 01:19:26,629
Is it close?

757
01:19:27,232 --> 01:19:28,898
It's behind us.

758
01:19:31,870 --> 01:19:33,061
Elevator.

759
01:19:53,966 --> 01:19:56,226
We can't kill it.

760
01:19:57,838 --> 01:19:59,370
I'm here.

761
01:20:01,043 --> 01:20:03,914
My chest, it's burning.

762
01:20:04,014 --> 01:20:06,272
Listen.

763
01:20:09,021 --> 01:20:10,983
Hear the heartbeat?

764
01:20:13,724 --> 01:20:16,416
It's not yours. You understand?

765
01:20:20,201 --> 01:20:23,268
Good, so let's go get it.

766
01:20:24,004 --> 01:20:25,104
Okay.

767
01:20:43,999 --> 01:20:47,328
Jesus Christ! Harley!

768
01:20:48,371 --> 01:20:51,701
A circle of light.
It's a circle of light!

769
01:20:52,043 --> 01:20:53,541
Get me...

770
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:58,812
Don't break it! Don't break the surface!

771
01:21:01,656 --> 01:21:03,221
I'm sorry.

772
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:11,097
Okay. Swing.

773
01:21:15,073 --> 01:21:17,505
- Swing?
- Yeah, swing your legs up.

774
01:21:18,946 --> 01:21:20,636
Get your legs on the roof.

775
01:21:31,061 --> 01:21:32,354
Come on.

776
01:21:37,904 --> 01:21:39,298
Harder!

777
01:21:39,439 --> 01:21:40,628
Yes!

778
01:21:56,513 --> 01:21:57,736
Run!

779
01:22:51,317 --> 01:22:52,711
Foster?

780
01:23:33,974 --> 01:23:35,664
Get out of there!

781
01:23:35,843 --> 01:23:37,408
Nice timing!

782
01:23:44,455 --> 01:23:46,390
- Five seconds.
- Okay.

783
01:23:46,490 --> 01:23:50,025
Four, three, two...

784
01:24:06,249 --> 01:24:07,439
Watch this!

785
01:24:11,390 --> 01:24:14,856
- We haven't been introduced. Dick Durkin.
- What?

786
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:21,792
I'm gonna fry the fucker.

787
01:24:22,471 --> 01:24:24,071
Shut it off.

788
01:24:24,841 --> 01:24:27,032
Okay, need a screwdriver.

789
01:24:27,777 --> 01:24:29,071
Move!

790
01:24:35,754 --> 01:24:37,320
Gimme some slack.

791
01:24:43,398 --> 01:24:44,725
Say when.

792
01:24:49,641 --> 01:24:51,035
Relax, pal.

793
01:24:54,381 --> 01:24:57,345
Get out of the water now!

794
01:24:58,051 --> 01:24:59,954
- When!
- Are you sure?

795
01:25:00,054 --> 01:25:02,519
- What?
- He said, "When."

796
01:25:08,532 --> 01:25:09,721
Off!

797
01:25:12,203 --> 01:25:14,235
Please, Durkin!

798
01:26:31,808 --> 01:26:33,475
Sweet dreams.

799
01:26:43,523 --> 01:26:45,089
Is it dead?

800
01:26:46,561 --> 01:26:47,462
Durkin?

801
01:26:47,562 --> 01:26:51,000
That's a difficult question to answer
with a simple "yes" or "no."

802
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:54,098
Philosophy of death is one
of my hobbies. Existentially...

803
01:26:54,270 --> 01:26:56,340
- Durkin!
- Tell me later.

804
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:58,506
I'll tell you later.

805
01:27:22,658 --> 01:27:25,562
Once again, the Black Masque power
prevails over evil.

806
01:27:25,662 --> 01:27:29,701
Yes, Detective Dick Durkin
and his psychic sidekick Harley Stone...

807
01:27:29,801 --> 01:27:31,202
can relax for a moment...

808
01:27:31,302 --> 01:27:35,511
before they are called forth once more
to do battle with the forces of darkness.

809
01:27:35,611 --> 01:27:37,613
Durkin?

810
01:27:37,713 --> 01:27:39,739
Shut up!

811
01:27:40,305 --> 01:28:40,799
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
