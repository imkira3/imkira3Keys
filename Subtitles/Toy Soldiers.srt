00:01:39,434 --> 00:01:41,862
Waiting for your reply.

3
00:01:44,481 --> 00:01:47,500
Waiting for your reply!

4
00:01:52,405 --> 00:01:55,039
I cannot do anything.

5
00:01:56,409 --> 00:01:59,870
Your father is already
in American hands.

6
00:01:59,871 --> 00:02:03,415
We are watching the airport.
His plane has not taken off.

7
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:06,085
You are watching the wrong plane.

8
00:02:06,086 --> 00:02:09,300
Your father was taken from
a military base this morning.

9
00:02:09,756 --> 00:02:12,392
You are lying.

10
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:21,600
We must act.

11
00:02:25,688 --> 00:02:27,148
Let's go!

12
00:02:38,451 --> 00:02:42,220
Luis.

13
00:02:43,081 --> 00:02:46,926
"We interrupt our coverage
to bring you this report..."

14
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,931
"...live via satellite
from the United States..."

15
00:02:52,966 --> 00:02:56,853
"...as extradited
narcotics trafficker..."

16
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:03,609
"...Enrique Cali arrives at Homestead
Air Force Base near Miami, Florida..."

17
00:03:03,768 --> 00:03:08,480
"even as the gunmen here at the Palace of
Justice continue to demand his release."

18
00:03:08,481 --> 00:03:10,482
Very well.

19
00:03:13,987 --> 00:03:15,800
We have to go, Judge!

20
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:19,491
Move forward!

21
00:03:19,492 --> 00:03:21,226
Hurry up!

22
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,502
Hey, bring that back here!

23
00:05:26,718 --> 00:05:29,821
Hey, Frank! Frank, over here!

24
00:05:44,537 --> 00:05:47,238
Frank, over here!

25
00:05:47,239 --> 00:05:49,240
- Looking for this, Frank?
- Very funny.

26
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:52,210
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

27
00:05:52,211 --> 00:05:55,112
The Dean's waiting for you
guys back in your room.

28
00:05:55,113 --> 00:05:57,682
A pleasure knowing you.

29
00:06:07,293 --> 00:06:10,795
These two gentlemen are deputy
United States marshals.

30
00:06:10,796 --> 00:06:13,698
They wish to have a word
with you, Mr. Donoghue.

31
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:16,133
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

32
00:06:16,134 --> 00:06:19,136
Let us have the room.

33
00:06:20,906 --> 00:06:23,875
Close the door behind you.

34
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:33,251
It's, uh, just a
precaution we're taking...

35
00:06:33,252 --> 00:06:36,287
With everyone involved in
the Enrique Cali case.

36
00:06:36,288 --> 00:06:39,924
Especially with your father since
he's presiding in the case.

37
00:06:39,925 --> 00:06:43,361
My father's been a federal judge
since I was five years old.

38
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:46,397
What's he saying?

39
00:06:46,398 --> 00:06:49,934
You saw what happened...
they're talking about Phil's dad.

40
00:06:49,935 --> 00:06:52,803
- He's a judge, right?
- Yeah.

41
00:06:52,804 --> 00:06:54,805
It was on all three networks.

42
00:06:54,806 --> 00:06:58,175
The boys are not allowed
TVs in their rooms.

43
00:06:58,176 --> 00:07:00,445
Luis Cali, his son,

44
00:07:00,446 --> 00:07:03,180
is, uh, passionately
devoted to his father.

45
00:07:03,181 --> 00:07:07,184
Took over the palace of justice down
there trying to get his father back.

46
00:07:07,185 --> 00:07:09,854
The judge and two
others were killed.

47
00:07:09,855 --> 00:07:12,357
- Is he in trouble?
- No.

48
00:07:12,358 --> 00:07:16,227
- Something about Colombia.
- Good coffee.

49
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:18,796
Now, you know why they have
to take these precautions.

50
00:07:18,797 --> 00:07:21,799
Your whole family will be
put in a very safe place.

51
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,402
They're taking him out today.

52
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:27,004
Oh, hey, hey, hey!

53
00:07:27,005 --> 00:07:29,039
Where?

54
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,477
We can't tell you that, son, but it
will be a secure military installation.

55
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:40,884
You gentlemen may as well come
in, help your roommate pack.

56
00:07:44,723 --> 00:07:45,402
See you soon.

57
00:07:45,403 --> 00:07:46,991
Good luck. We look forward
to having you back.

58
00:07:46,992 --> 00:07:49,994
- Thanks, sir. You too.
- All right.

59
00:07:55,334 --> 00:07:58,202
- Billy.
- See you later, Phil. Rock 'n' roll.

60
00:07:58,203 --> 00:08:00,938
Were you off campus yesterday?

61
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:03,333
I'm on probation, sir. I'm
not allowed off campus.

62
00:08:03,334 --> 00:08:04,609
That's right. I forgot.

63
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:08,112
You know, somebody spray painted
the Sheriff's car yesterday.

64
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:10,881
- Wrote the word "rejects" all over it.
- No kidding.

65
00:08:10,882 --> 00:08:13,384
- Mm-hmm.
- Hmm.

66
00:08:13,385 --> 00:08:15,886
All right, you got away
with it this time.

67
00:08:15,887 --> 00:08:20,024
Just remember, I'm always
gonna be watching you.

68
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:38,909
Lights out, boys.

69
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:42,079
Eat shit, Mr. Peterson!

70
00:08:45,384 --> 00:08:48,586
There go the Dean
and the Headmaster.

71
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:54,091
I can't go, man. This
paper's due in the morning.

72
00:08:54,092 --> 00:08:57,662
Come on. They're ready.
Let's go, let's go.

73
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,399
Come on! Let's go.

74
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,602
Billy, this is your homework.

75
00:09:04,603 --> 00:09:07,905
That's good. That's good.
Come on. Let's go.

76
00:09:16,147 --> 00:09:18,549
Take it easy, man. You're
gonna break the window.

77
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,018
Am not.

78
00:09:35,401 --> 00:09:37,402
Shut up, Snuffy!

79
00:09:37,403 --> 00:09:39,636
Blow me.

80
00:09:42,608 --> 00:09:44,609
Watch your head, man.

81
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:47,645
That's like a spinal injury, man.

82
00:09:47,646 --> 00:09:50,615
Quiet.

83
00:09:50,616 --> 00:09:52,917
I know you're mad, brother.

84
00:09:52,918 --> 00:09:55,085
Nice hole, Billy.

85
00:09:55,086 --> 00:09:57,922
Speaking of holes, anyone
have a sister? Call her up.

86
00:09:57,923 --> 00:09:59,924
- I saw Joey's mom at the mall.
- Saw his mom?

87
00:10:04,162 --> 00:10:07,164
You guys better leave
my mom out of this.

88
00:10:07,165 --> 00:10:10,935
I love my mom. And you
can, too, for 12 bucks.

89
00:10:10,936 --> 00:10:14,171
As long as you're not talking about
my mother, everybody's cool.

90
00:10:14,172 --> 00:10:16,441
Make yourselves comfortable.
The bar is open.

91
00:10:16,442 --> 00:10:18,876
- Mr. Trotta, why don't you tend the bar?
- Mouthwash?

92
00:10:18,877 --> 00:10:21,679
Yes, mouthwash. Or maybe not.

93
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,015
What's the deal, Billy? You trying
to tell me my breath stinks?

94
00:10:25,016 --> 00:10:27,952
I wasn't saying your breath stinks. Why
do you take everything so personally?

95
00:10:27,953 --> 00:10:30,187
Damn, Hank.

96
00:10:31,523 --> 00:10:35,059
I don't think smoking when you
have asthma is such a good idea.

97
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,895
- Smoking isn't such a good idea, period.
- Gentlemen.

98
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,699
- Here's to Mr. Donoghue.
- Yes, to Phil.

99
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,535
- May he get laid while on the outside.
- Amen.

100
00:10:44,536 --> 00:10:47,538
- This better not be mouthwash.
- Trust me.

101
00:10:49,675 --> 00:10:53,610
"Trust me." Asshole.
This is mouthwash.

102
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:54,715
No, it's not.

103
00:10:54,716 --> 00:10:56,647
Tastes like mouthwash.
What the hell is it?

104
00:10:56,648 --> 00:10:58,883
Four parts 100 proof vodka,

105
00:10:58,884 --> 00:11:01,853
two parts peppermint schnapps
for that mouthwash flavor...

106
00:11:01,854 --> 00:11:03,855
And one part crème de
menthe to make it green.

107
00:11:03,856 --> 00:11:05,857
You're a sick man.
I hope you know that.

108
00:11:05,858 --> 00:11:09,494
That's the beauty of this concept. It looks
and smells and tastes just like mouthwash.

109
00:11:09,495 --> 00:11:12,396
We can keep liquor in plain
sight in our dorm rooms, right?

110
00:11:12,397 --> 00:11:15,432
The best part, I sold 8 bottles of
this stuff for 35 bucks apiece.

111
00:11:15,433 --> 00:11:18,102
- We are rich.
- Ooh, brother, you is a genius.

112
00:11:18,103 --> 00:11:19,022
A lunatic, but a genius.

113
00:11:19,023 --> 00:11:21,271
Mix me up another shot. I'll
work on the entertainment.

114
00:11:21,272 --> 00:11:24,876
Man, this stuff is great. It's opening
up my lungs, making me breathe easier.

115
00:11:24,877 --> 00:11:27,092
Evidently, it's making
you fart easier too.

116
00:11:27,093 --> 00:11:28,012
I didn't fart.

117
00:11:28,013 --> 00:11:32,216
The first rule of prep school etiquette:
In a basement with no windows, don't fart.

118
00:11:32,217 --> 00:11:36,420
No, the first rule is to pretend you're
asleep when your roommate's beating off.

119
00:11:36,421 --> 00:11:41,125
The first rule is to wait until your
roommate falls asleep before beating off.

120
00:11:41,126 --> 00:11:43,928
Was that a personal remark
directed at me, roommate?

121
00:11:43,929 --> 00:11:46,430
- You choke your chicken. It's yours.
- You slap your monkey.

122
00:11:46,431 --> 00:11:48,599
I can't sleep at night.

123
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,868
Speaking of beating off.

124
00:11:50,869 --> 00:11:53,604
I'll do the talking.

125
00:11:53,605 --> 00:11:56,006
Hello?

126
00:11:57,475 --> 00:12:00,277
This is Jennifer. What's your name?

127
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:02,279
Steve.

128
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:06,150
Well, hello, Steve. Mmm.

129
00:12:06,151 --> 00:12:09,987
Oh, I like that name. Tell
me what you look like.

130
00:12:10,923 --> 00:12:13,190
Um... well,

131
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:15,593
I got blond hair...

132
00:12:15,594 --> 00:12:18,696
And, um, I wear an
earring in my left ear.

133
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:23,467
About five-nine, 150 pounds.

134
00:12:23,468 --> 00:12:26,604
Did I mention I'm black?

135
00:12:26,605 --> 00:12:28,806
Sounds very sexy, Steve.

136
00:12:28,807 --> 00:12:31,809
Oh, I like long, blond
hair on a black man.

137
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:35,279
Oh, I also got long, blonde hair.

138
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,816
I'm not black, but I'm
very, very tanned.

139
00:12:38,817 --> 00:12:43,487
I'm wearing black lace bra and panties
that look really hot against my skin.

140
00:12:43,488 --> 00:12:47,458
Oh! Would you like me
to take my bra off?

141
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:49,794
Yes.

142
00:12:49,795 --> 00:12:52,229
Yes, please.

143
00:13:06,177 --> 00:13:08,746
Oh, my nipples are dark red.

144
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:11,515
Oh, very big, very hard.

145
00:13:11,516 --> 00:13:15,086
Oh! Oh! I'm rubbing my breasts.

146
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:18,222
Oh, it feels so good.

147
00:13:18,223 --> 00:13:22,426
Steve, I'm running my hands
down over my body now.

148
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,996
Oh! Oh!

149
00:13:24,997 --> 00:13:29,366
- Slipping my thumbs inside my panties.
- Slip 'em in. Slip 'em in.

150
00:13:29,367 --> 00:13:33,704
I'm completely naked except for
black stockings and high heels.

151
00:13:33,705 --> 00:13:36,741
Would you like me to leave
them on or take them off?

152
00:13:36,742 --> 00:13:38,743
Take them off. Now.

153
00:13:38,744 --> 00:13:42,246
On. On. On. Leave them on.

154
00:13:42,247 --> 00:13:46,017
Why don't you go ahead
and leave them on?

155
00:13:46,018 --> 00:13:48,953
Steve, oh, you're so wicked.

156
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:53,257
- I like it. Oh. Ooh. Oh.
- She likes it. She likes it.

157
00:13:53,258 --> 00:13:56,560
It's so soft, so big.

158
00:13:56,561 --> 00:13:58,696
Oh, I just wanna touch it.

159
00:13:58,697 --> 00:14:01,866
You want me to touch
it, don't you, Steve?

160
00:14:01,867 --> 00:14:05,202
Yes. By all means, touch it.

161
00:14:05,203 --> 00:14:07,872
- Oh, Steve. Oh, my God!
- Touch it, baby, touch it.

162
00:14:07,873 --> 00:14:10,074
- Outstanding!
- Oh, Steve.

163
00:14:10,075 --> 00:14:13,310
Oh! Oh! Oh!

164
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:15,779
Hide it. Everybody move.

165
00:14:29,761 --> 00:14:32,596
Mr. Tepper.

166
00:14:32,597 --> 00:14:35,665
Why am I not surprised?

167
00:14:36,768 --> 00:14:39,937
This is ingenious.

168
00:14:39,938 --> 00:14:42,773
Thanks.

169
00:14:42,774 --> 00:14:45,209
What's this?

170
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:48,545
- Mouthwash?
- Oh, come on, Mr. Tepper.

171
00:14:48,546 --> 00:14:52,783
You expect me to believe you crawled down
to the basement just to drink mouthwash?

172
00:14:52,784 --> 00:14:54,785
I'm trying to fight plaque.

173
00:14:54,786 --> 00:14:57,687
Gingivitis. Tartar buildup.
I got a little...

174
00:14:58,456 --> 00:15:01,792
- Are you alone down here?
- Yes, sir.

175
00:15:01,793 --> 00:15:04,494
- Where's your roommate?
- Up in his room, I guess.

176
00:15:04,495 --> 00:15:07,164
Shit.

177
00:15:07,165 --> 00:15:09,133
Watch your mouth.

178
00:15:09,134 --> 00:15:11,902
Come on out, Mr. Bradberry.

179
00:15:18,309 --> 00:15:21,978
You too, Mr. Trotta.
May as well come out.

180
00:15:24,315 --> 00:15:26,783
He was bluffing.

181
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:29,887
- Gesundheit.
- Thank you.

182
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:32,957
Mr. Giles and Mr.
Montoya, come out now.

183
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:37,794
Or I'll place a guard on this basement,
have a bed check of the entire school.

184
00:15:43,668 --> 00:15:46,937
Gentlemen, I want you
all in my office...

185
00:15:46,938 --> 00:15:49,907
At 9:00 A.M. Sharp
tomorrow morning.

186
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:52,777
Go to your rooms now. Move!

187
00:15:52,778 --> 00:15:55,011
Not you, Billy.

188
00:16:00,952 --> 00:16:03,353
This...

189
00:16:03,354 --> 00:16:05,722
you know, this is really,
really ingenious.

190
00:16:05,723 --> 00:16:09,827
No, noth...
just, uh, put the little...

191
00:16:09,828 --> 00:16:13,330
- Where'd you get this stuff?
- Radio shack.

192
00:16:13,331 --> 00:16:15,732
Really? Was it expensive?

193
00:16:15,733 --> 00:16:18,602
No, no, I picked it up on sale.

194
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:21,138
On sale. Good. Here.

195
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,608
- Break it.
- What?

196
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:27,244
Throw it on the floor. Smash it.

197
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:32,516
Use your foot.

198
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:36,586
Come on, come on. Use your foot.
Make believe it's my foot.

199
00:16:36,587 --> 00:16:38,922
Smash it.

200
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:46,062
That's enough.

201
00:16:49,201 --> 00:16:51,435
Let's go.

202
00:17:26,238 --> 00:17:28,438
This is the U.S. Border Patrol!

203
00:18:20,992 --> 00:18:23,994
You think you're the first kid to
put liquor in mouthwash bottles?

204
00:18:23,995 --> 00:18:25,996
It was done in my day.

205
00:18:25,997 --> 00:18:29,799
I might have even done it myself.

206
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,875
Mr. Kouf, Mr. Greenwalt.

207
00:18:40,711 --> 00:18:45,582
Mr. Tepper here sold you a bottle
of mouthwash with vodka in it?

208
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:49,319
You will not be punished if you
give it to me in five seconds.

209
00:18:54,826 --> 00:18:57,561
Good. Good night.

210
00:19:04,702 --> 00:19:06,979
- Who's next?
- If you're gonna kick me out,

211
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,840
kick me out. Don't make me look
like a narc to my friends.

212
00:19:09,841 --> 00:19:13,877
If we expelled you, that'd make
four prep schools in four years.

213
00:19:13,878 --> 00:19:16,194
You trying for the
guinness book of records?

214
00:19:16,195 --> 00:19:17,772
No, sir.

215
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,118
Should we try this one?

216
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,291
How 'bout this one?

217
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:29,926
This one? Ah.

218
00:19:29,927 --> 00:19:31,928
Yes.

219
00:19:34,565 --> 00:19:37,034
Mr. Burg, Mr. Zarpas.

220
00:19:37,035 --> 00:19:39,903
Billy Tepper sold you
a bottle of vodka.

221
00:19:39,904 --> 00:19:42,906
You have until the count of
three to hand it out here.

222
00:19:42,907 --> 00:19:46,243
One, two...

223
00:19:46,244 --> 00:19:48,278
Good. Good night.

224
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:50,634
- Now, where to next?
- You made your point.

225
00:19:50,635 --> 00:19:54,318
I can't fake you out. Fine. I admit it.
Don't put me through this anymore.

226
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:58,455
I'm sorry, but I will not have
alcohol in my dormitories.

227
00:19:58,456 --> 00:20:01,625
Then I'll get it.
I'll bring it to you.

228
00:20:01,626 --> 00:20:03,627
- How many more are there?
- Eight.

229
00:20:03,628 --> 00:20:06,129
- You better not lie to me.
- Eight.

230
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,602
I believe you. I'll
be in my apartment.

231
00:20:12,603 --> 00:20:15,339
You have ten minutes.

232
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,431
Do you think we should expel you?

233
00:20:40,432 --> 00:20:44,334
Do whatever you want. I'm not about
to beg to stay in this school.

234
00:20:44,335 --> 00:20:49,473
If we threw you out, who would you
live with? Your mother or your father?

235
00:20:49,474 --> 00:20:52,976
I don't exactly have a burning desire
to live with either one of them.

236
00:20:52,977 --> 00:20:56,680
Then what's behind this perverse desire to
constantly risk getting thrown out of school?

237
00:20:56,681 --> 00:20:58,682
You think I set out to get caught?

238
00:20:58,683 --> 00:21:00,951
I don't think you do
it purely for fun.

239
00:21:00,952 --> 00:21:03,720
I was having loads of fun
until you came along.

240
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:06,656
Should I pack or what?
Shut up and sit down.

241
00:21:06,657 --> 00:21:10,626
Stop acting like such a tough
guy. It doesn't impress me.

242
00:21:20,871 --> 00:21:23,006
I'm not going to expel you.

243
00:21:23,007 --> 00:21:28,011
Three schools have done that and it's
obviously done nothing for your character.

244
00:21:28,012 --> 00:21:31,381
- Are you listening to me?
- Yes, sir.

245
00:21:31,382 --> 00:21:34,618
I'm gonna do much worse.

246
00:21:34,619 --> 00:21:38,622
I am going to keep you
here until you graduate.

247
00:21:38,623 --> 00:21:41,225
It will probably take
years at this rate.

248
00:21:41,226 --> 00:21:43,827
I might wear you out before then.

249
00:21:44,629 --> 00:21:48,798
Don't you worry about
wearing me out.

250
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,267
I'm gonna wear you out.

251
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,478
Well?

252
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:04,781
He wanted to know why I
have such a bad attitude.

253
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,751
Did he kick you out?

254
00:22:07,752 --> 00:22:09,753
No.

255
00:22:09,754 --> 00:22:12,756
He put me on pots and pans
for the rest of the semester.

256
00:22:12,757 --> 00:22:14,991
Could be worse.

257
00:22:14,992 --> 00:22:18,094
Yeah, he could have smashed my
kneecaps with a ball-peen hammer.

258
00:22:18,095 --> 00:22:20,564
God, that fucker. That asshole!

259
00:22:20,565 --> 00:22:23,933
Get up. Get up!
We gotta strike back.

260
00:22:23,934 --> 00:22:26,436
We have to do something
epic tonight...

261
00:22:26,437 --> 00:22:29,706
Or else I'm gonna look like a douche
bag to the entire school. Come on.

262
00:22:29,707 --> 00:22:32,633
You were born looking
like a douche bag, Billy.

263
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:38,615
Come on, Joey. Get dressed!

264
00:22:38,616 --> 00:22:42,052
I don't want to, man. I want to go
to sleep, dream about Jennifer.

265
00:22:42,053 --> 00:22:44,354
Later.

266
00:22:44,355 --> 00:22:47,557
It was fucking humiliating, man.

267
00:22:49,093 --> 00:22:51,094
Okay.

268
00:22:51,095 --> 00:22:53,096
See, they're up for it.

269
00:22:53,097 --> 00:22:56,433
- You know me, man. I'm always up for it.
- Good.

270
00:22:56,434 --> 00:22:59,236
What am I up for tonight?

271
00:22:59,237 --> 00:23:02,138
I don't know. I'm
thinking about it.

272
00:23:02,139 --> 00:23:05,108
- Fire hoses.
- That's been done.

273
00:23:05,109 --> 00:23:07,977
Cherry bombs in the toilets.

274
00:23:07,978 --> 00:23:12,249
It's too destructive. That would let
the Dean know he got under our skin.

275
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,585
No, it's gotta be cooler than that.

276
00:23:14,586 --> 00:23:18,054
It's gotta be something
witty, something elegant.

277
00:23:18,989 --> 00:23:21,592
Why don't you think about
it while I take a nap?

278
00:23:21,593 --> 00:23:23,927
I got it. I got it. Come on.

279
00:23:23,928 --> 00:23:26,162
You'll love this.

280
00:23:35,473 --> 00:23:38,542
Come in.

281
00:23:39,744 --> 00:23:43,046
Sir, Dr. Gould would like to see
you right away in the quad.

282
00:23:52,457 --> 00:23:56,359
Check it out. It's the
Headmaster's furniture.

283
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:08,171
Try not to laugh.

284
00:24:08,172 --> 00:24:10,406
I'm trying.

285
00:24:11,376 --> 00:24:13,377
I mean, just look at this.

286
00:24:13,378 --> 00:24:16,713
The blotter, the pen,
the teacup on my desk.

287
00:24:18,048 --> 00:24:21,150
Everything just as
I left it last night.

288
00:24:23,321 --> 00:24:26,089
You know what I'd
really like to do?

289
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:29,760
That's to work out here all day.

290
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:33,096
I don't suppose that would be too
good for discipline, would it?

291
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:35,665
- I'm afraid not.
- Yes.

292
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:40,337
- Any idea who did it?
- Very good idea.

293
00:24:40,338 --> 00:24:42,339
Don't be too hard on them.

294
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:46,343
It's much better than fire hoses in the
chapel or cherry bombs in the toilet.

295
00:24:55,687 --> 00:24:58,888
- You!
- Yo, Billy!

296
00:24:58,889 --> 00:25:01,024
And you.

297
00:25:01,025 --> 00:25:03,259
And you two.

298
00:25:11,703 --> 00:25:15,572
You gentlemen have the honor
of returning this furniture...

299
00:25:15,573 --> 00:25:18,942
Back to its original place.

300
00:25:20,077 --> 00:25:22,646
Pick up that banana.

301
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:25,749
Whoa!

302
00:25:31,288 --> 00:25:33,990
Are there any objections?

303
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:36,492
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

304
00:25:38,262 --> 00:25:40,496
Yeah, sounds cool.

305
00:26:18,403 --> 00:26:22,706
- Hey, taste test.
- Well?

306
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,503
- Hi. Can I help you?
- How you doin'?

307
00:26:37,504 --> 00:26:40,440
We don't want to hurt anybody.
Get in the truck.

308
00:27:10,971 --> 00:27:13,406
Get down!

309
00:27:30,157 --> 00:27:34,360
Stay on the floor where you
are until we tell you to move.

310
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:37,396
Don't get up. Don't do anything.

311
00:27:37,397 --> 00:27:39,832
Is that clear?

312
00:27:43,403 --> 00:27:48,841
Hey! Stop! No! Don't hurt him!

313
00:29:16,864 --> 00:29:19,365
They're looking for Donoghue.

314
00:29:19,366 --> 00:29:21,935
You can threaten me
as much as you like.

315
00:29:21,936 --> 00:29:26,840
The fact remains that officers from the
United States Marshal's Service...

316
00:29:26,841 --> 00:29:29,209
Took young Donoghue out
of school yesterday,

317
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:32,712
and they did not say where
they were taking him.

318
00:29:32,713 --> 00:29:35,715
I have been under a
lot of strain lately,

319
00:29:35,716 --> 00:29:38,117
and I don't have a lot of patience.

320
00:29:38,118 --> 00:29:42,222
If you're lying and he's
here, I will find him.

321
00:29:42,223 --> 00:29:44,457
I'll kill you.

322
00:29:45,893 --> 00:29:48,127
He's not here.

323
00:30:01,408 --> 00:30:05,144
According to this, you're
telling the truth.

324
00:30:05,145 --> 00:30:07,914
If you continue to do that, you
have nothing to fear from me.

325
00:30:07,915 --> 00:30:11,251
These young men have
done nothing to you.

326
00:30:11,252 --> 00:30:13,486
I realize that.

327
00:30:21,262 --> 00:30:24,998
How could this happen? We pay a
fortune for this kind of information!

328
00:30:24,999 --> 00:30:28,967
We were in transit. They couldn't get
to us. But we might not have a problem.

329
00:30:29,904 --> 00:30:32,338
I think you better
take a look at these.

330
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:35,974
Anderson, Robert.

331
00:30:37,611 --> 00:30:40,913
- Anderson, Robert!
- Here.

332
00:30:45,085 --> 00:30:48,307
Your father is president
of the Tex-peet oil company.

333
00:30:48,308 --> 00:30:49,614
Yes, sir.

334
00:30:53,027 --> 00:30:56,028
Bradberry, Jonathan.

335
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:07,206
Your father is Stephen Bradberry?

336
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:11,556
Chairman of the first
empire bank of New York?

337
00:31:11,557 --> 00:31:13,036
Yes.

338
00:31:14,415 --> 00:31:17,349
And vice chairman of
the republican party?

339
00:31:19,053 --> 00:31:21,287
Yes.

340
00:31:25,426 --> 00:31:29,462
- Giles, Henry the Third.
- Yes.

341
00:31:29,863 --> 00:31:32,064
Come here, Giles.

342
00:31:38,672 --> 00:31:42,033
Your father is representative
Henry Giles Jr.?

343
00:31:42,034 --> 00:31:42,942
Yes.

344
00:31:43,243 --> 00:31:45,411
Chairman of the Armed
Services Committee.

345
00:31:45,412 --> 00:31:47,913
Yes, sir.

346
00:31:47,914 --> 00:31:50,149
Trotta, Joseph.

347
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:03,529
Your father is Albert
Trotta of New York City.

348
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:06,099
Yes.

349
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,734
The Albert Trotta?

350
00:32:10,937 --> 00:32:14,873
What's the matter?
Not proud of your father.

351
00:32:16,843 --> 00:32:19,712
No.

352
00:32:19,713 --> 00:32:22,981
- Montoya, Ricardo.
- Yes, sir.

353
00:32:30,424 --> 00:32:34,627
Your father is senior partner
at Johnson, Montoya and Epps?

354
00:32:34,628 --> 00:32:36,629
Yes, sir.

355
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:39,198
And past president of the
California bar association.

356
00:32:39,199 --> 00:32:41,267
Yes, sir.

357
00:32:41,268 --> 00:32:44,070
So tell me, Ricardo.
Are you a Mexican?

358
00:32:44,071 --> 00:32:46,305
Mexican-American.

359
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:50,343
Do you speak Spanish?

360
00:32:50,344 --> 00:32:52,712
No, not really.

361
00:32:56,483 --> 00:32:58,918
- Put a bullet in him.
- No, wait!

362
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:02,522
"Wait" what? You
don't speak Spanish.

363
00:33:02,523 --> 00:33:06,559
I'm sorry. I do speak
a little Spanish.

364
00:33:15,269 --> 00:33:18,537
Hey, don't! Hey, don't do that!

365
00:33:23,677 --> 00:33:25,911
Come on, man.

366
00:33:29,183 --> 00:33:31,750
- Is he a friend of yours?
- Yes, he is.

367
00:33:31,751 --> 00:33:35,921
Tell your friend he's
lucky I didn't shoot him.

368
00:33:35,922 --> 00:33:37,923
What's your name?

369
00:33:37,924 --> 00:33:40,659
- William Tepper.
- William Tepper.

370
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:43,429
What does your father do, William?

371
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:45,664
He's a contractor.

372
00:33:53,173 --> 00:33:56,709
According to this, he owns the third
largest construction company in the world.

373
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:59,879
Yeah, he's a contractor.

374
00:34:01,448 --> 00:34:04,850
You're not afraid? Hmm?

375
00:34:04,851 --> 00:34:07,686
- Yes, I'm afraid.
- Good.

376
00:34:09,356 --> 00:34:11,724
Don't fuck with me.

377
00:34:22,536 --> 00:34:26,139
You're right, Jack. We
don't need Donoghue.

378
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,807
We can play with this.

379
00:34:28,808 --> 00:34:33,246
I want the slick little bastard
that spray painted my car!

380
00:34:33,247 --> 00:34:37,416
Otherwise, I'm gonna start arresting
any of them damn rejects...

381
00:34:37,417 --> 00:34:39,818
That even show their
face in this town!

382
00:34:39,819 --> 00:34:43,055
- I don't think so. Take a look at this.
- Mouthwash.

383
00:34:43,056 --> 00:34:45,324
No. It's vodka.

384
00:34:45,325 --> 00:34:47,593
- One-hundred proof vodka.
- So?

385
00:34:47,594 --> 00:34:50,263
So you got an Uncle that owns that
liquor store down the street.

386
00:34:50,264 --> 00:34:53,098
- Wait just a damn minute.
- You wait just a damn minute, Sheriff.

387
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:55,601
We're gonna make ourselves
a little deal here.

388
00:34:55,602 --> 00:34:58,437
You're gonna forget about who spray
painted your car, and I'm gonna forget...

389
00:34:58,438 --> 00:35:02,007
Sheriff! Somebody's been
shot at the Regis school!

390
00:35:02,008 --> 00:35:05,545
Come on, Dean.

391
00:35:30,304 --> 00:35:32,538
It's Frank Ingram.

392
00:35:33,907 --> 00:35:36,842
- What's going on up at the school?
- We don't know.

393
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:39,812
We get fired on if we try
to get past the gate.

394
00:35:42,916 --> 00:35:47,420
You two, you get your shotguns, get in the
back seat of my car and stay out of sight.

395
00:35:47,421 --> 00:35:51,090
You don't want to do that. You want
to call the state police or the F.B.I.

396
00:35:51,091 --> 00:35:53,759
Don't tell me what to do.

397
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,995
I'll call them myself.

398
00:35:59,566 --> 00:36:01,867
Now hear this up at the school.

399
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:06,105
This is the King's County Sheriff.

400
00:36:06,106 --> 00:36:08,608
Hold your fire.

401
00:36:08,609 --> 00:36:12,444
I'm coming up to talk to you.

402
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:19,785
I'm alone and unarmed.

403
00:36:19,786 --> 00:36:21,787
Hold your fire.

404
00:36:21,788 --> 00:36:22,680
Hold your fire.

405
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:26,400
Shoot at the engine. Prevent
them from coming closer.

406
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:40,456
Prepare the antitank.

407
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:45,669
Fire!

408
00:37:18,044 --> 00:37:21,213
Sheriff, Deputy Assistant
Director Otis Brown.

409
00:37:21,214 --> 00:37:22,078
How you doin'?

410
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,317
Sheriff has agreed to our
assuming jurisdiction.

411
00:37:24,318 --> 00:37:27,553
I've been briefed on the plane.
What's your assessment?

412
00:37:27,554 --> 00:37:29,850
Sir, there's an unknown
number of terrorists...

413
00:37:29,851 --> 00:37:33,759
with .50-caliber machine
guns and antitank rockets.

414
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,129
There's about three miles of
perimeter around the campus...

415
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:40,232
And their weapons can
sweep the whole area.

416
00:37:40,233 --> 00:37:43,068
We've got to get assistance
from the military.

417
00:37:43,069 --> 00:37:45,137
I'll try to get it.

418
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:47,594
No communication from
the school at all?

419
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,708
None.

420
00:38:08,628 --> 00:38:11,196
Your father's well?

421
00:38:11,197 --> 00:38:15,768
He's tired of being in prison.
He's ready to go home.

422
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,846
I'm glad you could get
here so quickly, Ed.

423
00:38:29,847 --> 00:38:31,149
My pleasure, Otis.

424
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:35,755
I have troops taking up observation positions
around the perimeter of the school...

425
00:38:35,756 --> 00:38:39,892
And an assault force at a
staging area five minutes away.

426
00:38:39,893 --> 00:38:43,829
Now, my orders are to assist you
with observation and surveillance...

427
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:46,565
And plan a joint assault
with your people.

428
00:38:46,566 --> 00:38:48,567
That's it, Otis.

429
00:38:48,568 --> 00:38:51,570
Anything else would require
specific orders from the president.

430
00:38:51,571 --> 00:38:56,008
I understand. Let's hope
we never need to ask.

431
00:38:58,512 --> 00:39:00,746
Is it armed?

432
00:39:02,416 --> 00:39:05,217
It is now.

433
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:08,086
Oh, man!

434
00:39:08,087 --> 00:39:12,124
This is disgusting. They expect us
to eat this? This is dog vomit.

435
00:39:16,963 --> 00:39:21,100
The school gets taken over by terrorists,
and I'm still on pots and pans.

436
00:39:25,872 --> 00:39:30,208
Stop now. Please come outside.

437
00:39:30,209 --> 00:39:34,212
Anyone who leaves this
building will be shot.

438
00:39:34,213 --> 00:39:37,583
We will take a head count now
and again in the morning.

439
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:41,554
If one person is missing,

440
00:39:41,555 --> 00:39:44,389
Five of you will be executed.

441
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:47,626
If two are missing,
ten will be shot.

442
00:39:47,627 --> 00:39:50,362
And so on.

443
00:39:50,363 --> 00:39:53,732
Tomorrow we will begin a
head count every hour...

444
00:39:53,733 --> 00:39:56,234
On the hour.

445
00:39:56,235 --> 00:39:58,370
If all goes well,

446
00:39:58,371 --> 00:40:00,973
you will be allowed
out into the quad.

447
00:40:00,974 --> 00:40:05,878
But every hour on the hour,

448
00:40:06,847 --> 00:40:09,515
you must be in this
room to be counted.

449
00:40:09,516 --> 00:40:11,817
Is that understood?

450
00:40:12,586 --> 00:40:14,820
Second.

451
00:40:16,389 --> 00:40:20,092
You have seen these orange wires running
throughout this building and outside.

452
00:40:21,094 --> 00:40:23,929
These are wired to explosives.

453
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:27,199
If any one of these wires is cut,

454
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,002
the explosives will
go off automatically.

455
00:40:30,003 --> 00:40:33,672
If any of the individual
explosives are tampered with,

456
00:40:34,875 --> 00:40:37,176
they will explode!

457
00:40:39,045 --> 00:40:41,446
So...

458
00:40:41,447 --> 00:40:43,949
Don't touch the wires.

459
00:40:45,218 --> 00:40:47,519
Don't touch the explosives.

460
00:40:51,958 --> 00:40:54,202
Ninety-two.

461
00:40:54,203 --> 00:40:56,762
- Over there! Over there! Stop!
- All right, all right.

462
00:40:56,763 --> 00:40:59,965
- Just do as they say.
- Are you okay? Are you all right?

463
00:40:59,966 --> 00:41:01,967
What are you doing?

464
00:41:01,968 --> 00:41:04,203
Ow. Man, stop.

465
00:41:14,414 --> 00:41:16,916
Well, we managed to
stay together anyway.

466
00:41:16,917 --> 00:41:19,919
Yeah, that's my ambition in
life... to die with you guys.

467
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,755
You're the kid they call Yogurt,
right? This is your room?

468
00:41:22,756 --> 00:41:25,873
I'm Derek, and he's Ted,
and yes, this is our room.

469
00:41:25,874 --> 00:41:27,584
Not anymore.

470
00:41:28,595 --> 00:41:31,597
Ah, here we go.

471
00:41:31,598 --> 00:41:34,900
- Put that down!
- I guess some things never change.

472
00:41:34,901 --> 00:41:36,820
You have any sleeping
bags, any blankets?

473
00:41:36,821 --> 00:41:37,269
No.

474
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:39,508
Do you got any food
around here, candy bars?

475
00:41:39,509 --> 00:41:41,652
- You have any more magazines?
- No!

476
00:41:41,653 --> 00:41:44,388
- This your plane, Yogurt?
- Yeah, I made it.

477
00:41:44,389 --> 00:41:46,445
You understand all this
remote control stuff?

478
00:41:46,446 --> 00:41:48,447
Yes, I do.

479
00:41:48,448 --> 00:41:53,418
The thing the leader's got wrapped
around his wrist? You think it'll work?

480
00:41:53,419 --> 00:41:57,389
- Yeah.
- We're well and truly fucked.

481
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:59,558
They can't rescue us.
We'd all get killed.

482
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:03,062
- Then they'll pay the ransom.
- Maybe.

483
00:42:03,063 --> 00:42:05,798
We're gonna do something, right?

484
00:42:10,436 --> 00:42:14,640
We can't just sit by and let these
bastards fuck with our lives.

485
00:42:14,641 --> 00:42:17,409
- Do we have a choice?
- Yes.

486
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:20,312
Um, guys? Could we
change the subject?

487
00:42:20,313 --> 00:42:24,917
I'd like to go to bed
without wetting my pants.

488
00:42:24,918 --> 00:42:28,654
This is F.B.I. Deputy Assistant
Director Otis Brown.

489
00:42:28,655 --> 00:42:30,823
Who am I speaking to?

490
00:42:30,824 --> 00:42:34,259
This is Dr. Robert Gould,
the Head... Headmaster.

491
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,862
Look, all the boys are here.

492
00:42:36,863 --> 00:42:40,799
They're all alive and in good health.
They're frightened, of course.

493
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,835
- Tell them about the explosives.
- What?

494
00:42:42,836 --> 00:42:46,605
- Explosives.
- There are explosives all over the campus.

495
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:50,008
He says that if the wires
are cut, they'll blow up.

496
00:42:51,845 --> 00:42:54,613
And he has a remote
control device...

497
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:57,282
Attached by tape to
the back of his hand.

498
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:59,985
He says he can blow the school
up by pressing a button.

499
00:42:59,986 --> 00:43:02,287
It is true.

500
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,456
And I will not hesitate.

501
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:08,694
If you attack the school, my men will
begin shooting students until you stop.

502
00:43:08,695 --> 00:43:13,165
But if by some miracle,
you kill all of my men,

503
00:43:13,166 --> 00:43:17,069
whatever happens, I will still
have time to press the button...

504
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:20,038
And every one of us will die.

505
00:43:21,074 --> 00:43:23,642
I am releasing the faculty.

506
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:26,545
One of them will be carrying a
complete list of my demands.

507
00:43:26,546 --> 00:43:29,181
These are nonnegotiable.

508
00:43:29,182 --> 00:43:31,850
If you do not produce
my father unharmed,

509
00:43:31,851 --> 00:43:35,587
I will begin executing
the hostages.

510
00:43:35,588 --> 00:43:39,424
I'm sure by now you have discovered
who these students are...

511
00:43:39,425 --> 00:43:41,927
And who their parents are.

512
00:43:41,928 --> 00:43:44,697
"Rejects." I assume the
students did this.

513
00:43:44,698 --> 00:43:46,699
Yes.

514
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:50,502
Over half the student body consists of
boys expelled from other prep schools.

515
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:52,971
- Hence the nickname.
- I see.

516
00:43:52,972 --> 00:43:55,941
No, you don't see.

517
00:43:55,942 --> 00:43:59,945
My boys, many of them have a
real problem with authority.

518
00:43:59,946 --> 00:44:02,981
There's no telling what they might
do in a situation like this.

519
00:44:02,982 --> 00:44:04,917
That could damn well
get 'em killed.

520
00:44:04,918 --> 00:44:07,285
Exactly.

521
00:44:07,286 --> 00:44:10,322
There's one boy in particular.

522
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:14,126
Here they come.

523
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:23,135
There's a body.

524
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,908
I think it's Jesse Miller,

525
00:44:29,909 --> 00:44:32,544
the chemistry teacher.

526
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:37,249
Do you think it's true
about the explosives?

527
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:40,252
Would he be willing to blow himself
up along with everyone else?

528
00:44:40,253 --> 00:44:45,090
I think he'd be willing to do anything
if he doesn't get his father back.

529
00:44:45,091 --> 00:44:48,293
Anything.

530
00:45:28,168 --> 00:45:30,735
Can't sleep, huh?

531
00:45:30,736 --> 00:45:32,737
Nope.

532
00:45:32,738 --> 00:45:34,739
Yeah, me neither.

533
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:38,143
None of us can sleep, especially
with you two yapping.

534
00:45:39,412 --> 00:45:41,413
Billy, we gotta do something.

535
00:45:41,414 --> 00:45:44,582
Yeah, we can be cool and
wait to be rescued.

536
00:45:44,583 --> 00:45:46,584
Anybody know morse code?

537
00:45:46,585 --> 00:45:49,487
With that light and a mirror, we
could send signals back and forth.

538
00:45:49,488 --> 00:45:53,391
No, Billy! Nobody knows morse code.

539
00:45:53,392 --> 00:45:55,627
For Christ's sakes.

540
00:46:01,767 --> 00:46:04,636
Well, we got the perfect
number for poker.

541
00:46:04,637 --> 00:46:07,339
Anybody got a deck of cards?

542
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:10,209
You can't smoke in the dorms.

543
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:12,878
What are they gonna
do, kick me out?

544
00:46:12,879 --> 00:46:15,113
Shut up, you guys.

545
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:20,652
Shut the door, go to sleep!

546
00:46:20,653 --> 00:46:24,523
Hey, Joey, shut the door.
Shut the door.

547
00:46:27,894 --> 00:46:30,048
There's one of them
at the end of the hall.

548
00:46:30,049 --> 00:46:31,555
Yeah?

549
00:46:35,168 --> 00:46:39,171
So we make some noise
and we get him in here.

550
00:46:39,172 --> 00:46:41,739
And then we jump him.

551
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:44,576
Then what?

552
00:46:44,577 --> 00:46:50,106
Billy, he's got a fuckin' machine gun.
With a fucking machine gun...

553
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:52,551
- ...we could shred these fuckers!
- Joey.

554
00:46:52,552 --> 00:46:55,320
This machine gun stuff must
run in mafia families.

555
00:46:55,321 --> 00:46:59,057
- You son of a bitch!
- Joey! Ow! Joey!

556
00:46:59,058 --> 00:47:02,261
- Come on, man.
- That was a joke, okay?

557
00:47:02,262 --> 00:47:05,330
I'm your friend. I can call
you a wop if I want to.

558
00:47:05,331 --> 00:47:07,332
Quiet.

559
00:47:07,333 --> 00:47:11,469
- They're crazy.
- Kiss and make up.

560
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,281
I'm sorry.

561
00:47:22,282 --> 00:47:25,217
Just don't call me
a wop, all right?

562
00:47:25,218 --> 00:47:29,121
Sure. Is it okay if I
call you an asshole?

563
00:47:29,122 --> 00:47:31,556
Sure. Asshole, dickhead. Whatever.

564
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:33,558
Fuck face.

565
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:36,895
All right, enough of this
machine gun stuff, Joey.

566
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:39,231
Oh, okay, mom.

567
00:47:39,232 --> 00:47:41,400
You think of a better idea.

568
00:47:41,401 --> 00:47:44,102
- You wanna know what we should do?
- No.

569
00:47:44,103 --> 00:47:47,639
We need to find out everything about
these guys who are holding us.

570
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:50,475
How many there are, what kind of
guns they have, all that stuff.

571
00:47:50,476 --> 00:47:53,178
Then we need to get that
information to the outside world.

572
00:47:53,179 --> 00:47:55,547
Then they can get in and rescue us.

573
00:47:55,548 --> 00:47:58,083
It's a very cool idea. Let's do it.

574
00:47:58,084 --> 00:48:00,986
That sounds like a lot of
effort for underachievers.

575
00:48:00,987 --> 00:48:05,089
The difference is, if the Dean
catches you, he doesn't kill you.

576
00:48:05,992 --> 00:48:10,195
- Are you with me or not?
- What do you...

577
00:48:10,196 --> 00:48:12,297
Of course we're with you, man.

578
00:48:12,298 --> 00:48:16,000
But if you get us shot,
we're gonna be pissed.

579
00:48:18,304 --> 00:48:22,274
Parents of the hostages being held at the
Regis school have been arriving all day...

580
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:25,877
And are being urged by F.B.I.
Officials to stay at a local motel.

581
00:48:25,878 --> 00:48:29,046
We'll try and talk with some
of the parents. Excuse me.

582
00:49:04,683 --> 00:49:06,684
Jerry, come on, man.

583
00:49:06,685 --> 00:49:09,421
Bring that back.

584
00:49:22,068 --> 00:49:27,506
Now, gentlemen, this object
I'm holding here is called...

585
00:49:27,507 --> 00:49:30,208
some of you may have seen one of
these before. It's called a book.

586
00:49:30,209 --> 00:49:32,610
You may have seen
one on television.

587
00:49:32,611 --> 00:49:35,713
Fellas, the ball's over here.
Thank you very much.

588
00:49:35,714 --> 00:49:39,451
Don't pay any attention to them.

589
00:49:40,286 --> 00:49:43,288
Sooner or later,
they'll all be gone.

590
00:49:43,289 --> 00:49:45,990
Oh, yes, but this book...

591
00:49:45,991 --> 00:49:50,294
Will be important... Forever.

592
00:49:55,734 --> 00:49:57,969
Guard.

593
00:50:03,509 --> 00:50:06,844
Hey, Gube. Heard you brought a breakfast
tray up to the lookouts in west hall.

594
00:50:06,845 --> 00:50:08,846
- Yeah.
- What room were they in?

595
00:50:08,847 --> 00:50:10,915
- They were in the infirmary.
- How many?

596
00:50:10,916 --> 00:50:13,718
- Two.
- What kind of stuff do they have?

597
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:15,920
What do you mean? What stuff?

598
00:50:15,921 --> 00:50:19,257
- Guns, grenades. That kind of stuff.
- They had tons of it.

599
00:50:19,258 --> 00:50:22,427
All kinds. A big machine gun.

600
00:50:22,428 --> 00:50:25,530
Wait a minute. I'm not gonna
get in trouble for this, am I?

601
00:50:25,531 --> 00:50:27,966
Don't be a wuss. Describe
the machine gun.

602
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:31,236
Why don't you send your troops in
there and shoot the sons of bitches?

603
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:33,738
You are crazy. Just shut up.

604
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:38,276
Did you realize that the head
of the New Jersey mafia...

605
00:50:38,277 --> 00:50:40,445
Is here in this room?

606
00:50:40,446 --> 00:50:42,581
I see him.

607
00:50:42,582 --> 00:50:44,583
Knowing that,

608
00:50:44,584 --> 00:50:47,652
you let him send his
son to your school?

609
00:50:47,653 --> 00:50:49,654
Of course.

610
00:50:49,655 --> 00:50:52,524
It's not the boy's fault
who his father is.

611
00:50:52,525 --> 00:50:55,560
The F.B.I. advises parents
to pay the ransom.

612
00:50:55,561 --> 00:50:57,962
Why don't you just give
the guy what he wants?

613
00:50:57,963 --> 00:51:00,898
In the first place, the F.B.I.
Has no such policy.

614
00:51:00,899 --> 00:51:05,470
But beyond that, your sons
haven't been kidnapped.

615
00:51:05,471 --> 00:51:08,840
They're being held hostage
by a gang of terrorists.

616
00:51:08,841 --> 00:51:11,576
As we know, it's United
States policy...

617
00:51:11,577 --> 00:51:14,312
Not to accede to terrorist demands.

618
00:51:14,313 --> 00:51:19,117
That policy is gonna have to change. We'll
go to the white house if we have to!

619
00:51:19,118 --> 00:51:22,754
My family isn't rich. We don't
have influence at the white house.

620
00:51:22,755 --> 00:51:25,243
My son is on a full
scholarship to the school.

621
00:51:25,244 --> 00:51:26,057
So is mine.

622
00:51:26,058 --> 00:51:29,994
We should talk to the press. Why should
our kids suffer alongside the rich kids?

623
00:51:29,995 --> 00:51:32,397
Nobody should go to
the white house.

624
00:51:32,398 --> 00:51:34,599
Nobody should talk to the press.

625
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,934
I know how much of
a strain this is,

626
00:51:36,935 --> 00:51:39,937
but you could be putting your
sons in even greater danger.

627
00:51:39,938 --> 00:51:43,275
So please, let the
experts handle this.

628
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:54,419
80, 81, 82,

629
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:57,222
83, 84, 85,

630
00:51:57,223 --> 00:51:59,224
86, 87,

631
00:51:59,225 --> 00:52:01,793
88, 89,

632
00:52:01,794 --> 00:52:04,696
90, 91, 92.

633
00:52:05,964 --> 00:52:07,999
Back outside now, please.

634
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,903
Beyond saying there is an adequate
number, I'm not prepared to comment.

635
00:52:11,904 --> 00:52:14,406
Are the hostages safe at this time?

636
00:52:14,407 --> 00:52:17,409
The hostages are obviously in
a very dangerous situation...

637
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:20,378
And will be so until
they are released.

638
00:52:20,379 --> 00:52:22,380
Everybody's accounted for.

639
00:52:22,381 --> 00:52:25,083
Are negotiations in progress
now with the terrorists?

640
00:52:25,084 --> 00:52:27,985
This administration has never
waivered from the policy...

641
00:52:27,986 --> 00:52:32,591
That the United States must never
give in to the demands of terrorists.

642
00:52:32,592 --> 00:52:37,095
To do so would only encourage
more hostage taking.

643
00:52:37,096 --> 00:52:39,330
Well, we'll see.

644
00:52:43,953 --> 00:52:46,654
- Hey, man, I'm supposed to...
- We know.

645
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:50,458
- Be careful, man.
- You bet.

646
00:52:53,262 --> 00:52:56,464
I'm supposed to take this
to your guys upstairs.

647
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:36,304
Lunch.

648
00:53:48,084 --> 00:53:50,751
Enjoy.

649
00:54:10,472 --> 00:54:13,274
We got two guards
in the bell tower,

650
00:54:13,275 --> 00:54:16,477
two more in the attic
of fisher hall.

651
00:54:16,478 --> 00:54:20,048
There's two in the infirmary and
two more on the roof of west hall.

652
00:54:20,049 --> 00:54:22,050
That's eight.

653
00:54:22,051 --> 00:54:25,553
Three in the quad makes 11, and
the leader in the office is 12.

654
00:54:25,554 --> 00:54:28,123
His name is Luis Cali.

655
00:54:28,124 --> 00:54:32,260
And the three guys in the quad...
that's Jorge, Ruiz and Carlos.

656
00:54:32,261 --> 00:54:34,262
That's right. You speak Spanish.

657
00:54:34,263 --> 00:54:36,497
Don't forget the American
guy with the glasses.

658
00:54:36,498 --> 00:54:39,567
That makes 13. This man.

659
00:54:53,649 --> 00:54:56,818
- You know Vinny?
- Vinny.

660
00:54:56,819 --> 00:55:01,322
The F.B.I.'s crawling all over me. I
didn't even wanna use a pay phone.

661
00:55:01,323 --> 00:55:04,525
- You seen the news?
- Yeah, of course.

662
00:55:04,526 --> 00:55:07,395
This Enrique Cali... the
old man who's in prison...

663
00:55:07,396 --> 00:55:09,297
he's been around. We've
done business with him.

664
00:55:09,298 --> 00:55:11,766
I know the Bars brothers
are in with him very big.

665
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:13,840
So is Dino Frenetti
and his boy Micky.

666
00:55:13,841 --> 00:55:16,604
All right. I want you to
reach out to them fast.

667
00:55:16,605 --> 00:55:19,440
Tell them to get to the old
man and explain about my son.

668
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:22,277
All right. It's done, right away.

669
00:55:22,278 --> 00:55:25,146
The kid hates me.

670
00:55:25,147 --> 00:55:27,916
Albert, hey, hey.

671
00:55:27,917 --> 00:55:31,485
Kids are kids. They go
through, uh, a stage.

672
00:55:31,486 --> 00:55:35,023
They're ashamed of us.
Hey, it's just a phase.

673
00:55:35,024 --> 00:55:39,393
No, it's different with Joey.
He really hates me.

674
00:55:39,394 --> 00:55:41,395
But what can I do?

675
00:55:41,396 --> 00:55:45,466
I love him... And I
want him out of there.

676
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:48,802
- It's done. Right away, okay?
- Go ahead.

677
00:55:50,372 --> 00:55:54,275
Billy, we've got enough to do
without you thinking up more ideas.

678
00:55:54,276 --> 00:55:57,397
Excuse me, I'm having a private
conversation with Yogurt.

679
00:55:57,398 --> 00:55:58,046
Billy!

680
00:55:58,047 --> 00:56:01,110
This is the chip that sends
radio signals to the plane?

681
00:56:01,111 --> 00:56:02,116
Right.

682
00:56:02,117 --> 00:56:04,986
And it's the same kind of chip that
he's got in the garage door opener,

683
00:56:04,987 --> 00:56:07,956
the thing wrapped around his wrist,
the one that controls the explosives?

684
00:56:07,957 --> 00:56:11,025
Well, it should be. I mean, all
chips aren't standardized.

685
00:56:11,026 --> 00:56:14,528
Then if we could somehow
switch these chips,

686
00:56:14,529 --> 00:56:17,732
then we would control the bombs and he
would control the plane with his wrist deal.

687
00:56:17,733 --> 00:56:20,668
- Right.
- Don't be ridiculous.

688
00:56:20,669 --> 00:56:24,839
First of all, the guy's got the remote
control tied around his wrist all the time.

689
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:28,609
- How you gonna get it?
- I think he has a point.

690
00:56:28,610 --> 00:56:29,744
He could be knocked out.

691
00:56:29,745 --> 00:56:33,031
There's no way that anybody could
knock him out without giving him time

692
00:56:33,032 --> 00:56:36,585
to press the button. And his men
would just shoot you if you did.

693
00:56:36,586 --> 00:56:37,618
Maybe.

694
00:56:37,619 --> 00:56:40,121
Even if you could get it,
why switch the chips?

695
00:56:40,122 --> 00:56:42,556
You can just take the thing
and flush it down the toilet.

696
00:56:42,557 --> 00:56:45,226
We're getting the information out.
I guess we're doing all we can do.

697
00:56:45,227 --> 00:56:47,929
- What do you think of this?
- Is it legible?

698
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:50,965
Only if you know how to read.

699
00:56:50,966 --> 00:56:53,534
I told you the searchlight
would be important.

700
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:55,536
That's great, Joey.
"If you know how to read."

701
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:59,573
Of course, the reverse
is also true.

702
00:56:59,574 --> 00:57:02,610
What the hell do you mean,
"The reverse is also true"?

703
00:57:02,611 --> 00:57:05,179
What I mean is if you
take the other chip...

704
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:07,681
the receiving chip...
out of the plane,

705
00:57:07,682 --> 00:57:11,052
then you can replace it with the
receiving chip from the detonator.

706
00:57:11,053 --> 00:57:13,388
Oh, yeah, that's wonderful.

707
00:57:13,389 --> 00:57:16,590
Now all we have to do is get Cali
out of the Headmaster's office,

708
00:57:16,591 --> 00:57:20,061
which he hardly ever leaves,
sneak past the guard,

709
00:57:20,062 --> 00:57:22,063
switch the chips without
setting off the bombs...

710
00:57:22,064 --> 00:57:24,232
And then get out
without being seen.

711
00:57:24,233 --> 00:57:26,867
That's right. That's it exactly.

712
00:57:26,868 --> 00:57:28,869
I was attempting to be sarcastic.

713
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:31,806
You shouldn't have been. You
should have been writing it down.

714
00:57:31,807 --> 00:57:34,409
Stop it, Billy. You're
beginning to scare me.

715
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:38,712
84, 85, 86, 87, 88,

716
00:57:38,713 --> 00:57:43,016
89, 90, 91, 92.

717
00:57:43,785 --> 00:57:46,187
Take 'em out.

718
00:57:46,188 --> 00:57:48,189
You may go outside now.

719
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:51,925
I'd like to see the sophomore
class by the bench, please.

720
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:05,239
Reggie. Over here, man. Come on.

721
00:58:18,153 --> 00:58:22,090
You got till exactly 45 minutes past
the hour to get back to the trees.

722
00:58:22,091 --> 00:58:24,892
- That's the big hand on the little nine.
- I'll be there.

723
00:58:24,893 --> 00:58:27,161
- Wait until they look the other way.
- Okay.

724
00:58:27,162 --> 00:58:30,063
- Ready?
- Ready.

725
00:58:34,603 --> 00:58:37,605
- Watch yourself, man.
- Kick the ball!

726
00:59:04,566 --> 00:59:06,801
All right.

727
00:59:55,217 --> 01:00:00,121
Roosevelt represented a
profoundly different view...

728
01:00:00,122 --> 01:00:02,390
Of the role of the
federal government.

729
01:00:02,391 --> 01:00:07,228
- Start it up.
- All right. Looks good to me.

730
01:00:07,229 --> 01:00:10,130
All right, pick it up.
Get it ready.

731
01:00:14,803 --> 01:00:17,505
Let her go.

732
01:00:18,373 --> 01:00:20,741
A view that, uh, troubled
the government...

733
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:22,910
In economic life...

734
01:00:25,981 --> 01:00:29,717
You really can fly it, huh, Derek?

735
01:00:46,335 --> 01:00:49,003
Oh, sh...

736
01:00:49,004 --> 01:00:50,871
- Oh.
- Oh, shit.

737
01:00:50,872 --> 01:00:53,674
Oh, dear.

738
01:01:00,682 --> 01:01:03,517
Hey, you...

739
01:01:19,268 --> 01:01:22,703
Be on the alert.

740
01:01:29,211 --> 01:01:32,813
Shut it down now.

741
01:01:41,890 --> 01:01:43,600
Jorge, give it to me.

742
01:01:44,426 --> 01:01:47,862
Man, come on!

743
01:02:07,916 --> 01:02:09,208
Hands on your head!

744
01:02:09,209 --> 01:02:11,561
Oh, great. Look.
I'm from the school.

745
01:02:11,562 --> 01:02:14,455
Here's all the information you
need about the people holding us.

746
01:02:14,456 --> 01:02:16,924
Be careful with it.
We're all fine so far.

747
01:02:16,925 --> 01:02:19,827
- Nice outfit. I gotta run.
- You gotta wait for the boss.

748
01:02:19,828 --> 01:02:22,563
I gotta get back before
somebody knows I'm gone!

749
01:02:22,564 --> 01:02:26,166
Kid, I'm sorry, but you're not going
anywhere until we check you out.

750
01:02:26,167 --> 01:02:28,469
You have a student named Tepper?

751
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:33,006
Yes. Billy Tepper. I've been
waiting for something from him.

752
01:02:33,007 --> 01:02:35,743
- Just keep him there.
- What's he done?

753
01:02:35,744 --> 01:02:38,212
There's a helicopter
on the pad outside.

754
01:02:38,213 --> 01:02:42,617
If he is one of your boys, go get
him and bring him back here.

755
01:02:42,618 --> 01:02:46,019
Roosevelt, by using the radio,

756
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:48,889
was able to speak to
the American people...

757
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:24,091
This is coffee.

758
01:04:16,144 --> 01:04:20,247
If you are who you say you are, we
cannot let you go back. They'd kill you.

759
01:04:20,248 --> 01:04:23,250
That's my problem. I can make it.
I've gotta go right now.

760
01:04:23,251 --> 01:04:26,354
- Billy.
- You gotta get me out of here, sir.

761
01:04:26,355 --> 01:04:28,255
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

762
01:04:28,256 --> 01:04:29,724
- You know this kid?
- Yes, of course.

763
01:04:29,725 --> 01:04:31,726
They're gonna shoot five
kids if I don't go back.

764
01:04:31,727 --> 01:04:33,109
They're gonna shoot
you if you do go back.

765
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:36,147
I can make it. You know
I can't lie to you.

766
01:04:36,148 --> 01:04:39,357
You gotta know I'm
telling you the truth.

767
01:04:41,470 --> 01:04:43,471
I believe you. Let him go.

768
01:04:43,472 --> 01:04:45,906
I cannot accept that
responsibility.

769
01:04:45,907 --> 01:04:48,008
Let him go.

770
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:52,146
Get him! Stop the kid before
he gets himself killed.

771
01:04:59,788 --> 01:05:02,022
Any second now.

772
01:05:53,942 --> 01:05:56,209
Where the hell is he?

773
01:05:56,210 --> 01:05:59,546
He'll be here. He'll be here.

774
01:06:30,679 --> 01:06:33,346
Oh, geez!

775
01:06:48,029 --> 01:06:50,264
He's got a minute.

776
01:06:52,868 --> 01:06:55,969
Oh, shit!

777
01:07:07,281 --> 01:07:10,450
Please, God.

778
01:07:33,341 --> 01:07:36,810
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on.

779
01:07:36,811 --> 01:07:39,980
- What do we do?
- We wait.

780
01:07:39,981 --> 01:07:43,750
Damn! It's already too late, man.

781
01:07:46,755 --> 01:07:49,456
71, 72, 73,

782
01:07:49,457 --> 01:07:52,560
74, 75, 76, 77,

783
01:07:52,561 --> 01:07:55,629
78, 79, 80, 81,

784
01:07:55,630 --> 01:07:59,633
82, 83, 84, 85, 86...

785
01:07:59,634 --> 01:08:01,702
get back in line!
I already counted you.

786
01:08:01,703 --> 01:08:05,973
87, 88, 89, 90, 91.

787
01:08:06,841 --> 01:08:09,943
- It's still 91.
- Count them again.

788
01:08:20,305 --> 01:08:22,806
Two helicopters are
coming towards us.

789
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:26,610
Okay. Open fire and prevent
them from getting closer.

790
01:08:44,345 --> 01:08:48,716
One, two, three, four, five...

791
01:08:48,717 --> 01:08:51,184
86, 87, 88,

792
01:08:51,185 --> 01:08:53,186
89, 90, 91.

793
01:08:53,187 --> 01:08:55,755
We got one boy missing.

794
01:09:03,098 --> 01:09:08,401
I told you what would happen
if one of you escaped.

795
01:09:08,402 --> 01:09:10,670
Did you think I was kidding?

796
01:09:22,784 --> 01:09:24,785
You first.

797
01:09:24,786 --> 01:09:27,454
Let's go. Face against
the wall. Come on.

798
01:09:28,222 --> 01:09:30,457
You too.

799
01:09:31,793 --> 01:09:33,693
You!

800
01:09:36,965 --> 01:09:40,067
You! Get over there!

801
01:09:40,068 --> 01:09:43,737
And you. Run.

802
01:09:43,738 --> 01:09:47,107
Run.

803
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:50,911
Oh, Jesus. I'm sorry.

804
01:09:50,912 --> 01:09:54,214
I was in the shower.
I didn't hear the bell ring.

805
01:09:54,215 --> 01:09:56,216
He's wet.

806
01:09:56,217 --> 01:09:58,719
- I'm sorry.
- So he is.

807
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:02,155
- Come with me. Come with me.
- I'm sorry.

808
01:10:04,225 --> 01:10:06,794
Okay, let's go. Get back
in line. It's all over.

809
01:10:06,795 --> 01:10:09,329
Come on! Go!

810
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:12,732
Okay, let's go. Come on.
Come on. Go.

811
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:20,207
My father sent me to a school
that looked a lot like this one.

812
01:10:23,111 --> 01:10:25,678
A military academy in Pennsylvania.

813
01:10:27,248 --> 01:10:31,218
Perhaps you've heard of it...
the Armitage school?

814
01:10:31,219 --> 01:10:33,487
Uh, yeah, I think so.

815
01:10:35,423 --> 01:10:38,092
You really have no sense
of discipline, do you?

816
01:10:38,093 --> 01:10:41,095
Look, I'm sorry about the
shower thing. I promise...

817
01:10:41,096 --> 01:10:43,163
Oh, shit.

818
01:10:43,164 --> 01:10:45,199
- This is how they taught me discipline,
- Oh, shit.

819
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:47,868
And believe you me,

820
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:51,038
I learned.

821
01:10:54,442 --> 01:10:57,978
This basement the kid is talking
about, it's not on the plans.

822
01:10:57,979 --> 01:10:59,980
It exists. I've been in it.

823
01:10:59,981 --> 01:11:02,682
There used to be a building right
here behind where the kitchen is.

824
01:11:02,683 --> 01:11:04,684
That's a subbasement
in that building.

825
01:11:04,685 --> 01:11:06,996
There's no building
directly above it then.

826
01:11:06,997 --> 01:11:07,988
That's right.

827
01:11:07,989 --> 01:11:10,323
So if the hostages were
in the basement...

828
01:11:10,324 --> 01:11:12,726
And the buildings blew up,
they'd probably survive.

829
01:11:12,727 --> 01:11:16,230
That building was built in 1881.

830
01:11:16,231 --> 01:11:20,901
They built to last back in those days.
What about the explosives?

831
01:11:20,902 --> 01:11:22,290
It's interesting what the kid says

832
01:11:22,291 --> 01:11:24,905
about switching the chips in
the remote control receiver.

833
01:11:24,906 --> 01:11:27,975
- Could it work?
- It's very possible.

834
01:11:27,976 --> 01:11:31,678
I wouldn't wanna take the responsibility
for letting the kid try this,

835
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:34,214
but it could work.

836
01:11:34,215 --> 01:11:37,818
Take it easy. It's over.

837
01:11:37,819 --> 01:11:40,254
Washington has authorized
me to make a deal.

838
01:11:40,255 --> 01:11:42,422
What are we giving them?

839
01:11:42,423 --> 01:11:45,192
Whatever it takes to
get the hostages free.

840
01:11:45,193 --> 01:11:47,694
We have a shot at a
successful assault here.

841
01:11:47,695 --> 01:11:50,030
We know the location
of every terrorist.

842
01:11:50,031 --> 01:11:53,733
The kid can get the other
students out of the line of fire.

843
01:11:53,734 --> 01:11:56,870
What kid? This kid has been
kicked out of two schools.

844
01:11:56,871 --> 01:11:59,072
- No, three schools.
- Three schools.

845
01:11:59,073 --> 01:12:01,842
Come on. All of this is unreliable.

846
01:12:01,843 --> 01:12:05,745
Well, that's not really true. I may not
rely on Billy getting to class on time,

847
01:12:05,746 --> 01:12:08,581
but I would rely on this.

848
01:12:08,582 --> 01:12:12,452
- Why?
- Because he's got guts. He's a leader.

849
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:15,956
You can see that he's, uh,
thought this thing through.

850
01:12:15,957 --> 01:12:20,527
Now, if Billy says he can do
it, I gotta believe he can.

851
01:12:22,163 --> 01:12:25,098
If everything goes perfect,

852
01:12:25,099 --> 01:12:28,969
could we guarantee no
casualties among the hostages?

853
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:32,872
Guarantee? No, of course not.

854
01:12:33,641 --> 01:12:36,776
Then our orders are to cut a deal.

855
01:12:36,777 --> 01:12:38,778
That's unacceptable.

856
01:12:38,779 --> 01:12:41,781
The demands in my letter
must be followed exactly.

857
01:12:41,782 --> 01:12:43,783
I'll have to go back
to my superiors.

858
01:12:43,784 --> 01:12:47,321
- We'll need time to discuss this.
- I understand.

859
01:12:47,322 --> 01:12:50,891
In recognition of your
willingness to negotiate,

860
01:12:50,892 --> 01:12:54,294
the execution scheduled for 5:00
P.M. today will be postponed.

861
01:12:54,295 --> 01:12:59,399
However, if we have not concluded
a deal by 5:00 P.M. tomorrow,

862
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:02,569
There will be no further delays.

863
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:08,175
We won.

864
01:13:47,982 --> 01:13:51,218
We just got a message
from Albert Trotta.

865
01:13:51,219 --> 01:13:54,187
Trotta's kid, Joey, goes
to the Regis school.

866
01:13:54,188 --> 01:13:56,390
He naturally wants him out.

867
01:13:56,391 --> 01:13:59,259
And he'd be a good guy
to have owe us a favor.

868
01:13:59,260 --> 01:14:01,794
Give me something to write with.

869
01:14:09,137 --> 01:14:11,971
Give this message to my son.

870
01:14:13,674 --> 01:14:16,543
They're receiving another message.

871
01:14:35,330 --> 01:14:38,732
It's the Headmaster.

872
01:14:43,037 --> 01:14:45,305
How you feeling?

873
01:14:45,306 --> 01:14:47,707
Okay.

874
01:14:47,708 --> 01:14:50,010
Come to my office,
will you, Mr. Trotta?

875
01:14:50,011 --> 01:14:52,946
- They want to see you.
- Why?

876
01:14:52,947 --> 01:14:57,016
I don't think they mean you
any harm. I'll go with you.

877
01:14:59,753 --> 01:15:02,255
- It's all right.
- Okay.

878
01:15:22,110 --> 01:15:24,344
We're letting you go.

879
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:28,081
- What?
- You're free to go.

880
01:15:28,082 --> 01:15:30,984
These men will take you
to the main entrance.

881
01:15:30,985 --> 01:15:34,754
All you have to do is
walk down the driveway.

882
01:15:36,957 --> 01:15:39,192
Why me?

883
01:15:40,395 --> 01:15:43,330
Because we respect your father.

884
01:15:44,165 --> 01:15:46,533
Fuck my father...

885
01:15:46,534 --> 01:15:49,068
And fuck you.

886
01:15:50,004 --> 01:15:52,805
I'm not going anywhere
without my friends.

887
01:15:52,806 --> 01:15:55,108
Oh, yes, you are.

888
01:15:55,109 --> 01:15:57,511
Don't fight him! Just go!

889
01:15:57,512 --> 01:15:59,513
Ow! Oh!

890
01:15:59,514 --> 01:16:02,249
Let go of me!

891
01:16:04,752 --> 01:16:07,187
Okay, okay, all right.

892
01:16:07,188 --> 01:16:09,856
I'm going. I'm going.

893
01:16:27,542 --> 01:16:30,143
Joey! No! Joey!

894
01:16:30,144 --> 01:16:32,479
Let me go!

895
01:16:40,555 --> 01:16:44,491
- Jorge!
- Let me go!

896
01:16:44,492 --> 01:16:47,126
Joey! Joey!

897
01:16:50,364 --> 01:16:52,599
Oh, you fucker!

898
01:16:57,171 --> 01:17:00,200
- You son of a bitch!
- Okay!

899
01:17:01,073 --> 01:17:02,584
Bring him inside!

900
01:17:05,746 --> 01:17:07,171
Get in the room!

901
01:17:07,281 --> 01:17:09,783
Inside, let's go.

902
01:18:12,046 --> 01:18:14,848
Please wait there.

903
01:18:28,563 --> 01:18:32,299
It is very important that
you explain to them...

904
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:34,867
That we did not want
to kill this boy.

905
01:18:34,868 --> 01:18:37,571
We were releasing him, in fact.

906
01:18:37,572 --> 01:18:41,341
But he suddenly attacked my men and
they were forced to shoot him.

907
01:18:41,342 --> 01:18:44,678
I would like to see the Headmaster
and the other students, please.

908
01:18:44,679 --> 01:18:46,165
Not possible.

909
01:18:46,166 --> 01:18:49,482
Then release the Headmaster
and take me instead.

910
01:18:49,483 --> 01:18:51,285
No.

911
01:18:52,886 --> 01:18:55,589
It is very important
that you tell them...

912
01:18:55,590 --> 01:18:59,393
We did not intend to kill
this boy. It was an accident.

913
01:18:59,394 --> 01:19:02,095
It wouldn't have happened if you
hadn't come here in the first place.

914
01:19:02,096 --> 01:19:05,665
It wouldn't have happened if the American
government hadn't kidnapped my father!

915
01:19:05,666 --> 01:19:09,502
Now, we will leave as soon as
my father is returned to me.

916
01:19:09,503 --> 01:19:12,038
You tell them that.

917
01:19:12,039 --> 01:19:16,175
You tell them that this one was an
accident, but the next one won't be.

918
01:19:28,389 --> 01:19:31,491
They're gonna hunt you down,
you know that, don't you?

919
01:19:31,492 --> 01:19:35,461
They'll eventually find you,
and then they will kill you.

920
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:42,135
You Americans always say that,

921
01:19:42,136 --> 01:19:45,038
but you never actually do it.

922
01:19:58,786 --> 01:20:01,287
God, I am sorry.

923
01:20:02,122 --> 01:20:04,758
It's a lie... this stuff
about an accident.

924
01:20:04,759 --> 01:20:08,828
- I don't believe it.
- Well, it's what they claim.

925
01:20:08,829 --> 01:20:12,399
How does a kid have an accident that
gets him shot with a machine gun?

926
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,968
I don't know.

927
01:20:16,804 --> 01:20:19,706
These people are grown-ups,

928
01:20:19,707 --> 01:20:21,941
not like my son.

929
01:20:23,177 --> 01:20:27,580
It's time they found out there's
no such thing as an accident.

930
01:22:37,478 --> 01:22:39,746
The president has
waived Posse Comitatus,

931
01:22:39,747 --> 01:22:42,315
and we have orders to proceed
with the assault as planned.

932
01:22:42,316 --> 01:22:46,152
Our assault teams are to move out
to the helicopters and stand by.

933
01:22:46,153 --> 01:22:50,356
Cut the power to the campus and jam
everything... radio, TV, microwave.

934
01:22:50,357 --> 01:22:53,960
- I want an absolute and total blackout.
- What's going on?

935
01:22:53,961 --> 01:22:58,731
Yesterday your boy Billy Tepper suddenly
appeared on our side of the wire.

936
01:22:58,732 --> 01:23:00,733
How'd he do that?

937
01:23:00,734 --> 01:23:04,604
There's an old storm drain on the
east edge of the campus right there.

938
01:23:04,605 --> 01:23:07,807
It's got bars on it, but the boys
always manage to get through.

939
01:23:07,808 --> 01:23:10,743
- What's happening?
- Could you show our explosives expert...

940
01:23:10,744 --> 01:23:12,779
How to get through that drain?

941
01:23:12,780 --> 01:23:14,781
Of course. What's happening?

942
01:23:14,782 --> 01:23:16,950
Enrique Cali was just
murdered in prison.

943
01:23:16,951 --> 01:23:20,432
As soon as Luis Cali finds out
about his father's death,

944
01:23:20,433 --> 01:23:24,266
he'll start killing hostages. He
could very well blow up the school.

945
01:23:24,267 --> 01:23:26,559
We've got no choice.
We have to go in.

946
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:29,596
We're doing everything we
can, but I gotta tell you,

947
01:23:29,597 --> 01:23:34,501
the casualties could be high unless
your boy does what he says he can do.

948
01:23:34,502 --> 01:23:38,504
- He'll try.
- He better.

949
01:23:46,780 --> 01:23:49,716
- Billy, wake up.
- I'm awake.

950
01:23:49,717 --> 01:23:53,386
That's the signal. They're going
to attack and they want our help.

951
01:23:53,387 --> 01:23:56,890
They're crazy. What the hell do they think
we can do? We'll get everybody killed.

952
01:23:56,891 --> 01:24:00,493
- This was your idea.
- It's too late to back out now.

953
01:24:00,494 --> 01:24:01,763
No, it isn't.

954
01:24:01,764 --> 01:24:03,563
They're depending on
us to do what we said!

955
01:24:03,564 --> 01:24:07,133
They'll stop depending on
us when we don't answer.

956
01:24:11,471 --> 01:24:14,807
You asshole! Give me that!

957
01:24:18,345 --> 01:24:20,713
Get off me!

958
01:24:20,714 --> 01:24:23,382
Maybe it was a mistake
to follow your plan,

959
01:24:23,383 --> 01:24:25,718
but we did because
you wanted us to.

960
01:24:25,719 --> 01:24:28,888
Now it's too late to back out. We
can't back out and neither can you.

961
01:24:28,889 --> 01:24:32,124
I've been a major fuckup my
whole life. I'll get you all killed.

962
01:24:32,125 --> 01:24:33,993
Come on, man.

963
01:24:33,994 --> 01:24:36,729
I'm sorry. The cuts on your back.

964
01:24:36,730 --> 01:24:40,132
Forget about the cuts. That's the
least of our problems right now.

965
01:24:40,133 --> 01:24:43,870
Your plan is just as good now as it was
yesterday when we thought it was great.

966
01:24:43,871 --> 01:24:45,981
- We were wrong yesterday.
- No, stop this, Billy!

967
01:24:45,982 --> 01:24:47,849
You got us into it.
You gotta get us out.

968
01:24:47,850 --> 01:24:49,842
If you say, "Do it for Joey,"
I'm gonna fucking puke.

969
01:24:49,843 --> 01:24:53,980
We don't have to tell
you why. You know why.

970
01:25:02,990 --> 01:25:05,391
You're fucking morons.

971
01:25:05,392 --> 01:25:08,794
You know that, don't you?
You're fucking morons.

972
01:25:12,132 --> 01:25:15,134
That's why we hang with you, Billy.

973
01:25:16,503 --> 01:25:21,440
- We're really gonna do this?
- You bet.

974
01:25:21,441 --> 01:25:25,544
All right, we got a lot of
work to do, especially you.

975
01:25:27,180 --> 01:25:29,615
Me?

976
01:26:04,118 --> 01:26:07,219
Are you there? What
are you trying to do?

977
01:26:07,220 --> 01:26:10,322
You see, there's been a power
failure affecting the whole county.

978
01:26:10,323 --> 01:26:12,358
- They're working on it.
- I see.

979
01:26:12,359 --> 01:26:15,227
You have exactly one
hour to fix the power.

980
01:26:15,228 --> 01:26:18,564
Then I kill one hostage every
15 minutes until it's back on.

981
01:26:26,140 --> 01:26:30,042
All right now, just relax.
Try and act natural.

982
01:26:35,683 --> 01:26:40,252
The next guy comes out of the
bathroom, you two go, all right?

983
01:26:40,253 --> 01:26:43,656
When you come out of the storm drain, if you
stay to the right as you go up the hill,

984
01:26:43,657 --> 01:26:46,258
you'll be under cover until you
get to this point right here.

985
01:26:46,259 --> 01:26:49,295
It would be a lot easier
if I went along with you.

986
01:26:49,296 --> 01:26:51,630
I'm sorry, sir. We
can't let you do that.

987
01:26:51,631 --> 01:26:54,533
We'll be fine with the map.

988
01:27:04,311 --> 01:27:06,879
Hey, you guys all set?

989
01:27:12,019 --> 01:27:14,198
If there's any problem,
just turn off the water.

990
01:27:14,199 --> 01:27:16,723
- Okay.
- Come on.

991
01:27:22,329 --> 01:27:25,364
You sure this goes to the
Headmaster's office?

992
01:27:25,365 --> 01:27:28,901
How do you think I broke in to get
the Headmaster's furniture out?

993
01:27:28,902 --> 01:27:31,370
How do you think I got
the algebra final?

994
01:27:31,371 --> 01:27:36,042
Geez Louise, Yogurt, you'd think we were
going to defuse a bomb or something.

995
01:27:36,043 --> 01:27:39,711
It was a joke, Yogurt. Lighten up.

996
01:28:11,611 --> 01:28:13,912
Hey, man, are you okay?

997
01:28:19,653 --> 01:28:21,654
Get his medicine!

998
01:28:21,655 --> 01:28:23,656
Come on, quick. Out of the way.

999
01:28:32,808 --> 01:28:35,059
- Boss!
- What do you want?

1000
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:39,446
One of the students has a
problem, you should come.

1001
01:28:40,399 --> 01:28:43,325
I don't know, he can't breath.

1002
01:29:11,205 --> 01:29:13,772
All right, now what?

1003
01:29:13,773 --> 01:29:17,443
- You see that box?
- Yeah.

1004
01:29:17,444 --> 01:29:20,664
No, no, no! That's the detonator.
Don't touch that box.

1005
01:29:20,665 --> 01:29:24,550
It's the other box... the blue box.
The one with the light on it.

1006
01:29:24,551 --> 01:29:28,220
That's the remote control
receiver. Take the casing off.

1007
01:29:30,057 --> 01:29:33,492
Do any of your men have medical
training? This boy's very sick.

1008
01:29:44,238 --> 01:29:46,772
All right, what now?

1009
01:29:46,773 --> 01:29:49,975
All right, all right,
very, very carefully...

1010
01:29:49,976 --> 01:29:52,678
Take the red chip out
of the receiver.

1011
01:29:52,679 --> 01:29:55,314
Okay.

1012
01:29:56,750 --> 01:30:00,986
- There is no red chip.
- There must be.

1013
01:30:04,158 --> 01:30:06,492
Well, I'm sorry, there isn't.

1014
01:30:06,493 --> 01:30:10,229
There's a blue chip the same size as
the red chip, but there's no red chip.

1015
01:30:11,432 --> 01:30:13,466
That must be it then.

1016
01:30:13,467 --> 01:30:16,435
Well, is it or isn't it?

1017
01:30:17,404 --> 01:30:19,638
I don't know.

1018
01:30:26,947 --> 01:30:30,450
This boy has a history of medical
problems. You can see how sick he is.

1019
01:30:30,451 --> 01:30:33,586
You must call an ambulance.

1020
01:31:11,358 --> 01:31:13,793
Okay, it should just slide in now.

1021
01:31:32,443 --> 01:31:34,078
Oh, shit!

1022
01:32:04,278 --> 01:32:06,846
Watch out. I'm coming up.

1023
01:32:15,189 --> 01:32:19,124
Damn it. I can't just wait here.

1024
01:32:27,334 --> 01:32:29,768
Prepare to engage targets.

1025
01:32:30,704 --> 01:32:32,705
Confirm target acquisition.

1026
01:32:32,706 --> 01:32:35,173
- Targets are up.
- Fire.

1027
01:32:41,715 --> 01:32:43,749
He's got a history of asthma.

1028
01:32:43,750 --> 01:32:46,552
Oh.

1029
01:32:49,989 --> 01:32:53,792
- I'm feeling a little better, sir.
- Good, good.

1030
01:33:17,425 --> 01:33:19,645
- What was that?
- What was that?

1031
01:33:22,138 --> 01:33:24,898
Hello! Hello!

1032
01:34:19,696 --> 01:34:23,382
Hello! Hello! Hello!

1033
01:34:23,383 --> 01:34:25,826
It's not gonna work.
They jammed the radios.

1034
01:34:25,827 --> 01:34:27,920
Okay, Jack. Go take a look!

1035
01:34:42,502 --> 01:34:45,004
Shh. Listen.

1036
01:34:47,541 --> 01:34:50,909
Do you hear water running?

1037
01:34:50,910 --> 01:34:53,111
Yes.

1038
01:34:53,112 --> 01:34:56,715
Oh, good. I thought we
were in trouble. Move.

1039
01:35:21,207 --> 01:35:24,442
There. Now that wasn't
so hard, was it?

1040
01:35:33,987 --> 01:35:36,989
I got him. I got him. I got him!

1041
01:35:42,228 --> 01:35:44,363
Hit him, Yogurt!

1042
01:35:44,364 --> 01:35:46,899
Come on, Yogurt. Hit him!

1043
01:35:49,569 --> 01:35:52,271
Forget it. We're
jamming the radios.

1044
01:35:52,272 --> 01:35:55,908
Help me get to the Headmaster's
office... to the detonator...

1045
01:35:55,909 --> 01:35:58,410
Let's go.

1046
01:36:17,163 --> 01:36:20,265
Are you supposed to be here?

1047
01:36:20,266 --> 01:36:22,267
Yeah, I'm on pots and pans.

1048
01:36:22,268 --> 01:36:24,970
"Pozanpans"? What is "Pozanpans"?

1049
01:36:24,971 --> 01:36:28,574
No, pots and pans.

1050
01:36:28,575 --> 01:36:33,278
When they wanna give a kid a really terrible
punishment, they give him pots and pans.

1051
01:36:33,279 --> 01:36:36,582
I have to wash this
shit after every meal.

1052
01:36:36,583 --> 01:36:39,584
- Pots and pans.
- Yeah, pots and pans.

1053
01:36:57,100 --> 01:36:58,580
Did you hear that?

1054
01:37:27,467 --> 01:37:30,310
Take that! Come with me!

1055
01:37:36,743 --> 01:37:39,378
Come on! Let's go!
Everybody in the kitchen!

1056
01:37:39,379 --> 01:37:42,981
- Everybody in the kitchen!
- Move, move!

1057
01:37:44,651 --> 01:37:48,486
Come on, come on! Move!
Move, move, move, move!

1058
01:38:05,739 --> 01:38:07,973
Go.

1059
01:38:26,192 --> 01:38:29,561
Hurry it up! Come on, get in.

1060
01:38:42,959 --> 01:38:45,051
Stay outside!

1061
01:39:48,708 --> 01:39:52,277
Shh! Shh!

1062
01:39:52,278 --> 01:39:55,580
Shh! Shh!

1063
01:39:56,916 --> 01:39:59,217
Ruiz!

1064
01:39:59,218 --> 01:40:01,453
Jorge!

1065
01:40:10,596 --> 01:40:12,831
Jorge?

1066
01:40:21,507 --> 01:40:23,741
Get up!

1067
01:41:08,121 --> 01:41:11,056
Hold your fire. He's got a hostage!

1068
01:41:25,238 --> 01:41:27,213
No one is allowed in here!

1069
01:41:31,277 --> 01:41:34,446
Wait.

1070
01:41:49,645 --> 01:41:51,905
- Oh, God.
- Careful, Lukas!

1071
01:42:11,918 --> 01:42:14,887
I'm sorry.

1072
01:42:23,663 --> 01:42:25,819
Don't.

1073
01:42:25,820 --> 01:42:30,568
- What'll happen if he pulls out the wires?
- The bombs will go off. Shoot him.

1074
01:42:57,864 --> 01:43:00,465
Are you all right?

1075
01:43:00,466 --> 01:43:02,700
Yeah.

1076
01:43:15,281 --> 01:43:17,782
I'm sorry I was such
an asshole to you.

1077
01:43:17,783 --> 01:43:20,206
I mean, now that you saved
my life and everything.

1078
01:43:20,207 --> 01:43:24,703
Oh, it's okay. I never
took it personally.

1079
01:43:24,704 --> 01:43:25,757
Good.

1080
01:43:25,758 --> 01:43:30,595
Hey, congratulations.
You came through.

1081
01:43:30,596 --> 01:43:33,898
You just might graduate
in this lifetime.

1082
01:43:34,667 --> 01:43:36,835
Does that mean I'm
off pots and pans?

1083
01:43:36,836 --> 01:43:40,906
Oh, no. You don't think you're
gonna get off that easy, do you?

1084
01:43:40,907 --> 01:43:44,176
Huh?

1085
01:43:56,489 --> 01:43:58,856
Hey, have you guys seen Billy?
