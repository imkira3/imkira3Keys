1
00:01:40,857 --> 00:01:42,620
There was me.

2
00:01:43,026 --> 00:01:45,756
That is, Alex, and my three droogs.

3
00:01:46,029 --> 00:01:49,658
That is, Pete, Georgie and Dim.

4
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:53,627
And we sat in the Korova Milk Bar,
trying to make up our rassoodocks...

5
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:56,134
... what to do with the evening.

6
00:01:57,841 --> 00:02:00,935
The Korova Milk Bar sold milk plus.

7
00:02:01,177 --> 00:02:04,840
Milk plus vellocet or synthemesc or drencrom...

8
00:02:05,048 --> 00:02:07,039
... which is what we were drinking.

9
00:02:07,584 --> 00:02:08,983
This would sharpen you up...

10
00:02:09,185 --> 00:02:13,178
...and make you ready for a bit
of the old ultra-violence.

11
00:02:17,493 --> 00:02:20,985
In Dublin's fair city

12
00:02:21,698 --> 00:02:25,794
Where the girls are so pretty

13
00:02:26,903 --> 00:02:29,963
I first set my eyes

14
00:02:31,007 --> 00:02:34,602
On sweet Molly Malone

15
00:02:35,712 --> 00:02:40,411
As she wheeled her wheelbarrow

16
00:02:40,683 --> 00:02:45,017
Through streets broad and narrow

17
00:02:45,321 --> 00:02:49,724
Crying, "Cockles and mussels ..."

18
00:02:50,727 --> 00:02:52,820
One thing I could never stand ...

19
00:02:53,029 --> 00:02:55,429
... was to see a filthy, dirty old drunkie...

20
00:02:55,698 --> 00:02:58,326
...howling away at the filthy songs of his fathers...

21
00:02:58,635 --> 00:03:00,933
...and going "blerp blerp" in between...

22
00:03:01,137 --> 00:03:05,437
...as it might be a filthy old
orchestra in his stinking guts.

23
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:09,337
I could never stand to see anyone
like that, whatever his age.

24
00:03:09,545 --> 00:03:12,708
But more especially when he
was real old, like this one was.

25
00:03:20,356 --> 00:03:24,349
Can you spare some cutter, me brothers?

26
00:03:27,563 --> 00:03:32,626
Go on! Do me in, you bastard cowards!
I don't want to live anyway.

27
00:03:32,936 --> 00:03:35,734
Not in a stinking world like this.

28
00:03:38,474 --> 00:03:41,637
And what's so stinking about it?

29
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:46,144
It's a stinking world because
there's no law and order anymore!

30
00:03:46,382 --> 00:03:49,476
It stinks because it lets the young get onto the old...

31
00:03:49,752 --> 00:03:51,777
...like you done!

32
00:03:52,088 --> 00:03:56,889
It's no world for an old man any longer.

33
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,896
What kind of a world is it at all?

34
00:04:01,097 --> 00:04:02,997
Men on the moon.

35
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:05,790
Men spinning around the earth.

36
00:04:06,002 --> 00:04:09,062
And there's not no attention paid...

37
00:04:09,272 --> 00:04:12,799
...to earthly law and order no more.

38
00:04:13,176 --> 00:04:15,770
Oh, dear land

39
00:04:16,179 --> 00:04:18,477
I fought for thee

40
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:57,516
It was at the derelict casino
that we came across Billy-boy...

41
00:04:57,754 --> 00:04:59,813
...and his four droogs.

42
00:05:00,156 --> 00:05:02,556
They were about to perform
a little of the old...

43
00:05:02,859 --> 00:05:06,761
...in-out, in-out on a weepy
young devotchka they had there.

44
00:05:56,913 --> 00:05:59,780
Well, if it isn't fat, stinking...

45
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:04,315
... billy goat Billy-boy in poison.

46
00:06:05,188 --> 00:06:06,780
How are thou...

47
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:10,890
...thou globby bottle of cheap, stinking chip-oil?

48
00:06:12,595 --> 00:06:15,189
Come and get one in the yarbles...

49
00:06:15,431 --> 00:06:17,296
...if you have any yarbles...

50
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:20,525
...you eunuch jelly, thou.

51
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,701
Let's get them, boys!

52
00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:25,164
The police!

53
00:07:25,801 --> 00:07:27,393
Come on. Let's go!

54
00:07:48,324 --> 00:07:52,920
The Durango 95 purred away real horrorshow.

55
00:07:53,196 --> 00:07:57,394
A nice, warm vibratey feeling
all through your guttiwuts.

56
00:07:57,633 --> 00:08:00,830
Soon it was trees and dark, my brothers...

57
00:08:01,037 --> 00:08:03,631
... with real country dark.

58
00:08:40,476 --> 00:08:43,673
We fillied around with other travelers of the night...

59
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:46,279
...playing Hogs of the Road.

60
00:08:46,482 --> 00:08:48,473
Then we headed west.

61
00:08:48,751 --> 00:08:52,448
What we were after now
was the old surprise visit.

62
00:08:52,688 --> 00:08:53,882
That was a real kick...

63
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:58,593
...and good for laughs and
lashing of the old ultra-violent.

64
00:09:47,043 --> 00:09:49,034
Who on earth could that be?

65
00:09:58,154 --> 00:09:59,746
I'll go and see.

66
00:10:10,533 --> 00:10:12,160
Yes, who is it?

67
00:10:12,435 --> 00:10:16,428
Excuse me, can you please help?
There's been a terrible accident!

68
00:10:17,473 --> 00:10:21,773
My friend's bleeding to death!
Can I please use your telephone for an ambulance?

69
00:10:22,044 --> 00:10:25,343
We don't have a telephone.
You'll have to go somewhere else.

70
00:10:25,481 --> 00:10:28,177
But, missus, it's a matter of life and death!

71
00:10:28,484 --> 00:10:29,781
Who is it, dear?

72
00:10:29,985 --> 00:10:32,579
A young man.
He says there's been an accident.

73
00:10:32,788 --> 00:10:35,484
He wants to use the telephone.

74
00:10:36,492 --> 00:10:38,960
Well, I suppose you better let him in.

75
00:10:39,995 --> 00:10:41,860
Wait a minute, will you?

76
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:47,298
I'm sorry, but we don't usually
let strangers in--

77
00:10:59,382 --> 00:11:01,213
What do you want from me?

78
00:11:04,987 --> 00:11:07,820
Pete, check the rest of the house. Dim ...

79
00:11:12,628 --> 00:11:14,892
I'm singing in the rain

80
00:11:15,931 --> 00:11:17,831
Just singing in the rain

81
00:11:18,701 --> 00:11:20,532
What a glorious feeling

82
00:11:21,404 --> 00:11:22,894
I'm happy again

83
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,105
I'm laughing at clouds

84
00:11:27,243 --> 00:11:28,608
So dark up above

85
00:11:30,045 --> 00:11:31,603
The sun's in my heart

86
00:11:33,048 --> 00:11:34,845
And I'm ready for love

87
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:38,749
Let the stormy clouds chase

88
00:11:39,622 --> 00:11:41,556
Everyone from the place

89
00:11:43,926 --> 00:11:45,223
Come on with the rain

90
00:11:46,162 --> 00:11:48,255
I've a smile on my face

91
00:11:49,265 --> 00:11:51,358
I'll walk down the lane

92
00:11:52,368 --> 00:11:54,268
With a happy refrain

93
00:11:55,438 --> 00:11:57,269
And I'm singing

94
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,373
Just singing...

95
00:12:01,544 --> 00:12:02,670
...in the rain

96
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,440
I'm singing in the rain

97
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,840
Just singing in the rain

98
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,840
What a glorious feeling

99
00:12:22,904 --> 00:12:26,194
I'm happy again

100
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,305
I'm laughing at clouds

101
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:33,608
So dark up above

102
00:12:33,645 --> 00:12:37,603
The sun's in my heart

103
00:12:37,648 --> 00:12:40,845
And I'm ready for love

104
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,540
Let the stormy clouds chase

105
00:12:45,722 --> 00:12:49,356
Everyone from the place

106
00:12:49,426 --> 00:12:52,223
Come on with the rain

107
00:12:52,262 --> 00:12:55,855
I've a smile on my face

108
00:12:55,865 --> 00:12:59,158
I'll walk down the lane

109
00:12:59,368 --> 00:13:03,268
With a happy refrain

110
00:13:03,438 --> 00:13:05,669
And I'm singing

111
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,373
Just singing...

112
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,512
...in the rain

113
00:13:09,512 --> 00:13:10,945
Viddy well, little brother.

114
00:13:11,146 --> 00:13:12,841
Viddy well.

115
00:13:33,168 --> 00:13:37,036
We were all feeling a bit
shagged and fagged and fashed...

116
00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:41,867
...it having been an evening
of some small energy expenditure, oh my brothers.

117
00:13:42,144 --> 00:13:47,081
So we got rid of the auto and
stopped at the Korova for a nightcap.

118
00:13:53,389 --> 00:13:54,879
Hello, Lucy.

119
00:13:55,991 --> 00:13:57,686
Had a busy night?

120
00:13:59,395 --> 00:14:01,795
We've been working hard too.

121
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:06,064
Pardon me, Luce.

122
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:17,201
There was some sophistos from
the TV studios around the corner...

123
00:14:17,513 --> 00:14:19,708
...laughing and govoreeting.

124
00:14:20,015 --> 00:14:25,112
The devotchka smeched away, not
caring about the wicked world one bit.

125
00:14:26,021 --> 00:14:29,320
Then the disk on the stereo
twanged off and out.

126
00:14:29,592 --> 00:14:32,891
And in the short silence
before the next one came on...

127
00:14:33,128 --> 00:14:36,291
...she suddenly came
with a burst of singing.

128
00:14:40,135 --> 00:14:42,433
And it was like, for a moment,
O my brothers...

129
00:14:42,738 --> 00:14:46,037
...some great bird
had flown into the milk bar.

130
00:14:46,241 --> 00:14:49,438
And I felt all the malenky
little hairs on my plott...

131
00:14:49,745 --> 00:14:51,610
...standing endwise.

132
00:14:52,047 --> 00:14:56,108
And the shivers crawling up
like slow, malenky lizards...

133
00:14:56,352 --> 00:14:57,944
...and then down again.

134
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,916
Because I knew what she sang.

135
00:15:01,156 --> 00:15:04,557
It was a bit from the glorious Ninth, by Ludwig van.

136
00:15:13,369 --> 00:15:15,462
What did you do that for?

137
00:15:15,771 --> 00:15:17,762
For being a bastard with no manners.

138
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:22,941
Without a dook of an idea about how
to comport yourself public-wise, O my brother.

139
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,978
I don't like you should
do what you done.

140
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:31,851
And I'm not your brother no more
and wouldn't want to be.

141
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:36,689
Watch that.

142
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:42,791
Do watch that, if to continue
to be on live thou dost wish.

143
00:15:44,767 --> 00:15:45,995
Yarbles!

144
00:15:46,301 --> 00:15:48,997
Great, bouncy yarblockos to you!

145
00:15:49,471 --> 00:15:53,100
I'll meet you with chain
or nozh or britva anytime.

146
00:15:53,409 --> 00:15:56,003
I'm not having you aiming
tolchocks at me reasonless.

147
00:15:56,512 --> 00:15:59,379
It stands to reason,
I won't have it.

148
00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:07,520
A nozh scrap anytime you say.

149
00:16:22,404 --> 00:16:24,133
Doobidoob.

150
00:16:26,341 --> 00:16:28,332
A bit tired maybe.

151
00:16:30,412 --> 00:16:32,312
Best not to say more.

152
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:36,140
Bedways is rightways now.

153
00:16:36,652 --> 00:16:39,746
So best we go homeways
and get a bit of spatchka.

154
00:16:40,055 --> 00:16:41,522
Right, right?

155
00:16:41,555 --> 00:16:44,540
-Right, right.
-Right, right.

156
00:16:53,736 --> 00:16:56,432
Where I lived was with
my dada and mum...

157
00:16:56,739 --> 00:17:01,073
...in municipal flat block
18-A, Linear North.

158
00:18:26,962 --> 00:18:28,930
It had been a wonderful evening.

159
00:18:29,164 --> 00:18:32,656
And what I needed now
to give it the perfect ending...

160
00:18:32,968 --> 00:18:35,869
... was a bit
of the old Ludwig van.

161
00:19:25,988 --> 00:19:27,319
Oh, bliss!

162
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,983
Bliss and heaven!

163
00:19:30,525 --> 00:19:35,087
It was gorgeousness and
gorgeosity made flesh.

164
00:19:35,931 --> 00:19:39,924
It was like a bird
of rarest spun heaven metal.

165
00:19:40,135 --> 00:19:43,593
Or like silvery wine
flowing in a spaceship...

166
00:19:43,906 --> 00:19:46,636
...gravity all nonsense now.

167
00:19:47,209 --> 00:19:48,608
As I slooshied...

168
00:19:48,911 --> 00:19:51,903
...I knew such lovely pictures.

169
00:20:11,366 --> 00:20:12,924
Alex. Alex!

170
00:20:15,434 --> 00:20:20,426
Alex. Alex!

171
00:20:20,075 --> 00:20:21,565
What do you want?

172
00:20:21,777 --> 00:20:23,369
It's past eight, Alex.

173
00:20:23,645 --> 00:20:26,671
You don't want to be
late for school, son.

174
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,778
Bit of a pain in the gulliver, Mum.

175
00:20:31,086 --> 00:20:33,577
Leave us be,
and I'll try and sleep it off.

176
00:20:33,789 --> 00:20:36,587
And then I'll be as right
as dodgers for this after.

177
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:40,585
But you've not been
to school all week, son.

178
00:20:40,896 --> 00:20:42,056
Got to rest, Mum.

179
00:20:42,597 --> 00:20:44,394
Got to get fit.

180
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,292
Otherwise, I'm liable
to miss a lot more school.

181
00:20:48,603 --> 00:20:53,768
I'll put your breakfast in the oven.
I've got to be off meself now.

182
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:59,008
All right, Mum.
Have a nice day at the factory.

183
00:21:03,318 --> 00:21:06,481
He's not feeling too good
again this morning, Dad.

184
00:21:06,688 --> 00:21:08,588
Yes. Yes, I heard.

185
00:21:09,024 --> 00:21:10,514
You know what time he got in?

186
00:21:10,792 --> 00:21:13,784
No, I don't.
I'd taken me sleepers.

187
00:21:16,431 --> 00:21:17,921
I wonder...

188
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:22,326
...where exactly is it
he goes to work of evenings.

189
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:25,938
Like he says...

190
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,540
...it's mostly odd things he does.

191
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:29,936
Helping-like...

192
00:21:30,212 --> 00:21:32,840
... here and there, as it might be.

193
00:22:14,489 --> 00:22:16,480
Hi, hi, hi, Mr. Deltoid.

194
00:22:16,758 --> 00:22:18,692
Funny surprise, seeing you here.

195
00:22:18,894 --> 00:22:22,853
Alex-boy!
Awake at last, yes?

196
00:22:23,498 --> 00:22:26,490
I met your mother
on the way to work, yes?

197
00:22:26,768 --> 00:22:28,759
She gave me the key.

198
00:22:31,573 --> 00:22:33,803
She said something about
a pain somewhere.

199
00:22:34,076 --> 00:22:37,011
Hence, not at school, yes?

200
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:40,509
A rather intolerable pain
in the head, brother sir.

201
00:22:40,715 --> 00:22:42,876
It should be clear
by this afterlunch.

202
00:22:43,718 --> 00:22:46,312
Or certainly by this evening, yes.

203
00:22:46,621 --> 00:22:49,886
The evening's the great time,
isn't it, Alex-boy?

204
00:22:50,092 --> 00:22:53,584
-Cup of the old chai, sir?
-No time, no time.

205
00:22:53,895 --> 00:22:55,419
Sit, sit, sit!

206
00:22:57,032 --> 00:22:59,796
To what do I owe
this extreme pleasure, sir?

207
00:23:00,535 --> 00:23:01,695
Anything wrong, sir?

208
00:23:01,937 --> 00:23:05,737
Wrong? Why should you
think of anything being wrong?

209
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:08,441
Have you been doing
something you shouldn't?

210
00:23:08,643 --> 00:23:09,940
Just a manner of speech.

211
00:23:10,212 --> 00:23:13,238
Yes, well, it's just a manner
of speech from your...

212
00:23:13,448 --> 00:23:16,747
... post-corrective advisor to you
that you watch out, little Alex.

213
00:23:17,018 --> 00:23:20,545
Because next time it's not
going to be the corrective school.

214
00:23:20,755 --> 00:23:25,124
Next time it'll be the Barley place,
and all my work ruined.

215
00:23:25,327 --> 00:23:27,158
If you've no respect
for yourself...

216
00:23:27,362 --> 00:23:30,456
...you at least might have some
for me, who sweated over you.

217
00:23:30,732 --> 00:23:34,759
A big, black mark, I tell you,
for every one we don't reclaim.

218
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:38,267
A confession of failure
for every one of you...

219
00:23:38,573 --> 00:23:41,440
...who ends up in the stripy hole.

220
00:23:41,676 --> 00:23:43,473
I've been doing nothing I shouldn't.

221
00:23:43,778 --> 00:23:46,372
The millicents have nothing
on me, brother.

222
00:23:46,648 --> 00:23:47,979
Sir, I mean.

223
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:50,741
Cut out this clever talk
about millicents.

224
00:23:50,986 --> 00:23:53,250
Just because the police
haven't picked you up...

225
00:23:53,455 --> 00:23:56,652
...doesn't mean that you've not
been up to some nastiness.

226
00:23:56,892 --> 00:24:01,989
There was a bit of nastiness last night.
Some very extreme nastiness, yes?

227
00:24:02,297 --> 00:24:06,495
A few of a certain Billy-boy's
friends were ambulanced off late.

228
00:24:06,768 --> 00:24:08,099
Your name was mentioned.

229
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:10,600
The words got to me
by the usual channels.

230
00:24:10,805 --> 00:24:13,672
Certain friends of yours
were named also.

231
00:24:13,975 --> 00:24:17,172
Nobody can prove anything
about anybody, as usual.

232
00:24:17,412 --> 00:24:18,970
I'm warning you, little Alex...

233
00:24:19,281 --> 00:24:21,511
... being a good friend
to you as always...

234
00:24:21,716 --> 00:24:24,514
...the one man in this
sore and sick community...

235
00:24:24,719 --> 00:24:27,415
...who wants to save you
from yourself!

236
00:24:46,841 --> 00:24:48,536
What gets into you all?

237
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:52,041
We've been studying the problem
for damn well near a century.

238
00:24:52,347 --> 00:24:54,440
But we get no farther
with our studies.

239
00:24:54,749 --> 00:24:57,217
You got a good home here.
Good, loving parents.

240
00:24:57,452 --> 00:24:59,545
You've got not too bad of a brain.

241
00:24:59,854 --> 00:25:03,017
Is it some devil
that crawls inside of you?

242
00:25:03,325 --> 00:25:05,156
Nobody's got anything on me.

243
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,158
I been out of the millicents'
rookers for a long time.

244
00:25:08,363 --> 00:25:12,857
That's just what worries me.
A bit too long to be safe.

245
00:25:13,168 --> 00:25:14,965
You're about due, by my reckoning.

246
00:25:15,237 --> 00:25:16,568
That's why I'm warning you...

247
00:25:16,838 --> 00:25:20,274
...to keep your handsome
young proboscis out of the dirt.

248
00:25:20,575 --> 00:25:21,872
Do I make myself clear?

249
00:25:22,077 --> 00:25:23,544
As an unmuddied lake, sir.

250
00:25:23,778 --> 00:25:27,179
As clear as an azure sky
of deepest summer.

251
00:25:27,382 --> 00:25:29,680
You can rely on me, sir.

252
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:37,442
Excuse me, brother.

253
00:26:37,652 --> 00:26:41,315
I ordered this two weeks ago.
Can you see if it's arrived?

254
00:26:42,657 --> 00:26:44,022
Just a minute.

255
00:27:10,352 --> 00:27:11,944
Pardon me, ladies.

256
00:27:20,495 --> 00:27:23,157
Enjoying that, are you, my darling?

257
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:29,067
A bit cold and pointless,
isn't it, my lovely?

258
00:27:33,475 --> 00:27:36,308
What's happened to yours,
my little sister?

259
00:27:38,513 --> 00:27:39,980
Who you getting, bratty?

260
00:27:40,215 --> 00:27:42,308
Goggly Gogol?
Johnny Zhivago?

261
00:27:42,584 --> 00:27:44,484
The Heaven 17?

262
00:27:48,823 --> 00:27:52,589
What you got back home
to play your fuzzy warbles on?

263
00:27:52,894 --> 00:27:57,126
I bet you've got little
pitiful, portable picnic players.

264
00:27:57,399 --> 00:27:59,526
Come with Uncle
and hear all proper.

265
00:27:59,734 --> 00:28:02,828
Hear angel trumpets
and devil trombones.

266
00:28:03,037 --> 00:28:05,096
You are invited.

267
00:29:27,489 --> 00:29:28,421
Hi, hi, hi, there.

268
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:29,679
Well, hello.

269
00:29:29,924 --> 00:29:32,586
He are here!
He have arrived!

270
00:29:32,827 --> 00:29:34,419
Hooray!

271
00:29:35,096 --> 00:29:37,826
Welly, welly, welly,
welly, welly, welly, well!

272
00:29:39,601 --> 00:29:44,300
To what do I owe the extreme pleasure
of this surprising visit?

273
00:29:49,644 --> 00:29:51,339
We got worried.

274
00:29:54,215 --> 00:29:59,118
There we were, waiting and drinking
away at the old knifey moloko...

275
00:29:59,821 --> 00:30:01,846
...and you had not turned up.

276
00:30:02,357 --> 00:30:04,552
And we thought
you might have been, like...

277
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:07,125
...offended by something
or other.

278
00:30:07,362 --> 00:30:09,762
So around we come to your abode.

279
00:30:15,169 --> 00:30:17,364
Appy polly loggies.

280
00:30:17,672 --> 00:30:20,766
I had something of a pain
in the gulliver, so I had to sleep.

281
00:30:21,075 --> 00:30:23,873
I was not awakened
when I gave orders for wakening.

282
00:30:24,145 --> 00:30:26,545
Sorry about the pain.

283
00:30:27,248 --> 00:30:29,739
Using the gulliver
too much-like, maybe.

284
00:30:32,987 --> 00:30:36,445
Giving orders and
discipline and such, perhaps.

285
00:30:36,891 --> 00:30:39,189
You sure the pain is gone?

286
00:30:39,694 --> 00:30:42,754
You sure you'd not
be happier back in bed?

287
00:31:04,218 --> 00:31:08,518
Let's get things nice
and sparkling clear.

288
00:31:11,926 --> 00:31:14,417
This sarcasm,
if I may call it such...

289
00:31:14,629 --> 00:31:17,393
...does not become you,
my little brothers.

290
00:31:17,932 --> 00:31:22,335
As I am your droog and leader
I'm entitled to know what goes on.

291
00:31:24,238 --> 00:31:25,432
Now then, Dim.

292
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:29,836
What does that great big
horsey gape of a grin portend?

293
00:31:31,846 --> 00:31:35,612
All right, no more
picking on Dim, brother.

294
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:38,318
That's part of the new way.

295
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:49,962
New way?
What's this about a new way?

296
00:31:51,265 --> 00:31:56,168
There's been some very large talk
behind my sleeping back, I know it.

297
00:31:57,639 --> 00:32:00,472
If you must have it,
have it, then.

298
00:32:01,275 --> 00:32:03,937
We go around shop crasting
and the like...

299
00:32:04,178 --> 00:32:07,773
...coming out with a pitiful
rookerfull of money each.

300
00:32:08,082 --> 00:32:10,380
And Will the English
in the Muscleman coffee mesto...

301
00:32:10,652 --> 00:32:14,247
...saying he can fence anything
any malchick tries to crast.

302
00:32:14,489 --> 00:32:16,389
The shiny stuff. The ice!

303
00:32:16,658 --> 00:32:20,685
The big, big money's available,
is what Will the English says.

304
00:32:22,764 --> 00:32:25,995
And what will you do
with the big, big, big money?

305
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,200
Have you not everything you need?

306
00:32:28,503 --> 00:32:31,370
If you need a motorcar,
you pluck it from the trees.

307
00:32:31,673 --> 00:32:34,699
If you need pretty polly,
you take it.

308
00:32:34,909 --> 00:32:39,505
Brother, you think and talk
sometimes like a little child.

309
00:32:40,381 --> 00:32:42,906
Tonight we pull a man-size crast.

310
00:32:44,819 --> 00:32:47,219
Good! Real horrorshow!

311
00:32:47,422 --> 00:32:49,822
Initiative comes to thems that wait.

312
00:32:50,491 --> 00:32:53,483
I've taught you much,
my little droogies.

313
00:32:54,896 --> 00:32:58,297
Now tell me what you had in mind,
Georgie-boy.

314
00:33:01,636 --> 00:33:04,833
The old moloko plus first.
Would you not say?

315
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,839
-Something to sharpen us up.
-Some moloko plus.

316
00:33:10,411 --> 00:33:15,246
You got to go there first.
We got a start on you. Moloko Plus!

317
00:33:23,157 --> 00:33:25,557
As we walked along
the flatblock marina...

318
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:30,058
...I was calm on the outside,
but thinking all the time.

319
00:33:30,364 --> 00:33:32,855
So now it was to be
Georgie the General...

320
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:35,567
...saying what we should do
and what not to do.

321
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:39,772
And Dim as his mindless,
grinning bulldog.

322
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:43,670
But suddenly I viddied that
thinking was for the gloopy ones...

323
00:33:43,945 --> 00:33:49,076
...and that the oomny ones used, like,
inspiration and what Bog sends.

324
00:33:49,584 --> 00:33:53,384
For now it was lovely music
that came to my aid.

325
00:33:53,688 --> 00:33:56,748
There was a window open
with a stereo on...

326
00:33:56,991 --> 00:34:00,256
...and I viddied right at once what to do.

327
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:09,421
I had not cut into any
of Dim's main cables.

328
00:35:09,664 --> 00:35:11,962
And so with the help
of a clean tashtook...

329
00:35:12,166 --> 00:35:14,532
... the red, red kroovy soon stopped.

330
00:35:14,836 --> 00:35:18,465
And it did not take long to
quieten the two wounded soldiers...

331
00:35:18,673 --> 00:35:21,437
... down in the snug of the Duke of New York.

332
00:35:22,276 --> 00:35:25,837
Now they knew who was master and leader.

333
00:35:26,347 --> 00:35:28,281
Sheep, thought I.

334
00:35:28,549 --> 00:35:30,676
But a real leader knows
always when, like...

335
00:35:30,985 --> 00:35:34,182
... to give and show generous
to his unders.

336
00:35:36,791 --> 00:35:38,986
Well! Now we're back to where we were.

337
00:35:39,293 --> 00:35:40,590
Yes?

338
00:35:41,462 --> 00:35:43,692
Just like before,
and all forgotten?

339
00:35:43,998 --> 00:35:45,590
Right, right, right?

340
00:35:47,401 --> 00:35:48,493
Right.

341
00:35:51,405 --> 00:35:52,497
Right.

342
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:56,999
Right.

343
00:35:59,981 --> 00:36:02,108
Well, Georgie-boy...

344
00:36:02,483 --> 00:36:06,317
...this idea of yours for tonight.
Tell us all about it, then.

345
00:36:08,022 --> 00:36:09,080
Not tonight.

346
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:11,017
Not this nochy.

347
00:36:11,692 --> 00:36:14,217
Come, come, come, Georgie-boy.

348
00:36:14,829 --> 00:36:18,094
You're a big, strong chelloveck,
like us all.

349
00:36:18,332 --> 00:36:21,631
We're not little children,
are we, Georgie-boy?

350
00:36:22,336 --> 00:36:25,999
What, then, didst thou
in thy mind have?

351
00:36:32,847 --> 00:36:34,712
It's this health farm.

352
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:37,841
A bit out of the town.

353
00:36:38,853 --> 00:36:40,343
Isolated.

354
00:36:41,422 --> 00:36:46,052
It's owned by this rich ptitsa
who lives there with her cats.

355
00:36:46,661 --> 00:36:51,155
The place is shut down for a week
and she's completely on her own.

356
00:36:52,533 --> 00:36:56,230
It's full up with, like, gold and silver...

357
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:58,461
...and, like, jewels.

358
00:36:59,941 --> 00:37:03,775
Tell me more, Georgie-boy.
Tell me more.

359
00:37:09,483 --> 00:37:10,882
Oh, shit!

360
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:30,500
Who's there?

361
00:37:31,105 --> 00:37:33,096
Excuse me, can you please help?

362
00:37:33,307 --> 00:37:34,899
There's been a terrible accident!

363
00:37:35,109 --> 00:37:38,078
Can I please use your telephone
for an ambulance?

364
00:37:39,113 --> 00:37:41,081
I'm frightfully sorry.

365
00:37:41,983 --> 00:37:45,510
There's a telephone in the
public house a mile down the road.

366
00:37:45,786 --> 00:37:47,617
I suggest you use that.

367
00:37:47,822 --> 00:37:49,813
But missus, this is an emergency!

368
00:37:50,124 --> 00:37:51,921
It's a matter of life and death!

369
00:37:52,126 --> 00:37:55,926
Me friend's lying in the middle
of the road, bleeding to death!

370
00:37:56,931 --> 00:38:01,925
I'm very sorry, but I never open
the door to strangers after dark.

371
00:38:04,305 --> 00:38:06,102
Very well, madam.

372
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,635
You can't be blamed
for being suspicious...

373
00:38:08,943 --> 00:38:12,709
...with so many scoundrels
and rogues of the night about.

374
00:38:13,014 --> 00:38:15,539
I'll try and get help
at the pub, then.

375
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:18,218
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.

376
00:38:18,452 --> 00:38:21,546
Thank you very much.
Good night.

377
00:38:58,192 --> 00:38:59,591
Dim, bend down.

378
00:39:01,896 --> 00:39:04,865
I'll get in that window
and open the front door.

379
00:39:33,427 --> 00:39:35,224
Hello, Radlett Police Station?

380
00:39:35,529 --> 00:39:39,431
Good evening. It's Miss Weathers
at Woodmere Health Farm.

381
00:39:41,435 --> 00:39:45,428
I'm sorry to bother you, but
something rather odd just happened.

382
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:48,540
It's probably nothing at all,
but you never know.

383
00:39:49,443 --> 00:39:52,742
A young man rang the bell,
asking to use the telephone.

384
00:39:53,047 --> 00:39:55,242
He said there's been
some kind of accident.

385
00:39:55,549 --> 00:39:57,949
The thing that caught my
attention was what he said.

386
00:39:58,252 --> 00:40:02,120
His words sounded like those quoted
in the papers this morning...

387
00:40:02,356 --> 00:40:06,554
...in connection with the writer and
his wife who were assaulted last night.

388
00:40:07,862 --> 00:40:09,921
Just a few minutes ago.

389
00:40:12,233 --> 00:40:13,962
If you think that's necessary.

390
00:40:14,268 --> 00:40:16,930
But I'm quite sure
he's gone away now.

391
00:40:18,572 --> 00:40:20,267
All right, fine.

392
00:40:21,242 --> 00:40:23,335
Thank you very much.

393
00:40:27,882 --> 00:40:29,474
Hi, hi, hi, there.

394
00:40:29,783 --> 00:40:31,148
At last we meet.

395
00:40:31,352 --> 00:40:35,982
Our brief govorett through the
letter-hole was not, shall we say, satisfactory.

396
00:40:37,291 --> 00:40:38,588
Who are you?

397
00:40:39,793 --> 00:40:41,784
How the hell did you get in here?

398
00:40:43,764 --> 00:40:46,995
What the bloody hell
do you think you're doing?

399
00:40:51,105 --> 00:40:52,868
Naughty, naughty, naughty!

400
00:40:53,174 --> 00:40:55,699
You filthy old soomaka.

401
00:40:55,976 --> 00:40:59,503
Now listen here,
you little bastard!

402
00:40:59,813 --> 00:41:03,271
Just turn round and walk out
of here the same way you came in.

403
00:41:06,487 --> 00:41:07,977
Leave that alone!
Don't touch it!

404
00:41:08,222 --> 00:41:10,622
It's a very important work of art.

405
00:41:21,435 --> 00:41:23,903
What the bloody hell do you want?

406
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:28,140
To be perfectly honest, madam...

407
00:41:28,442 --> 00:41:31,741
... I'm taking part in an
international students'contest...

408
00:41:31,946 --> 00:41:35,746
...to see who can get the most
points for selling magazines.

409
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:38,043
Cut the shit, sonny...

410
00:41:38,352 --> 00:41:42,914
...and get out of here before you
get yourself into serious trouble.

411
00:41:43,257 --> 00:41:46,351
I told you to leave that alone!
Now get out of here...

412
00:41:46,527 --> 00:41:48,427
... before I throw you out!

413
00:41:48,862 --> 00:41:51,729
Wretched, slummy bedbug!

414
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:55,962
I'll teach you to break
into real people's houses.

415
00:41:57,238 --> 00:41:58,170
Fucking...

416
00:41:58,372 --> 00:41:59,361
...little...

417
00:41:59,974 --> 00:42:01,464
... bastard!

418
00:43:11,145 --> 00:43:14,114
-Let's go. The police are coming!
-One minoota, droogie.

419
00:43:20,821 --> 00:43:23,619
You bastards! I'm blind!

420
00:43:23,857 --> 00:43:27,918
I'm blind, you bastards!
I can't see!

421
00:43:41,775 --> 00:43:44,972
It's no good sitting there in hope,
my little brothers.

422
00:43:45,179 --> 00:43:49,479
I won't say a single solitary
slovo unless I have my lawyer here.

423
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:52,444
I know the law, you bastards.

424
00:44:00,294 --> 00:44:01,955
Righty-right, Tom.

425
00:44:03,464 --> 00:44:07,298
We'll have to show our friend Alex
here that we know the law too.

426
00:44:07,601 --> 00:44:10,195
But that knowing the law
isn't everything.

427
00:44:25,085 --> 00:44:27,815
Nasty cut you've got there,
little Alex.

428
00:44:28,822 --> 00:44:30,722
Shame, isn't it?

429
00:44:31,592 --> 00:44:33,617
Spoils all your beauty.

430
00:44:35,696 --> 00:44:37,323
Who gave you that, then?

431
00:44:38,732 --> 00:44:40,495
How'd you do that, then?

432
00:44:43,003 --> 00:44:45,028
What's your point, you bastard?

433
00:44:45,339 --> 00:44:47,534
That is for your lady victim.

434
00:44:47,841 --> 00:44:49,035
You ghastly...

435
00:44:49,243 --> 00:44:51,006
...wretched scoundrel.

436
00:44:53,414 --> 00:44:54,540
Get him off me!

437
00:44:55,549 --> 00:44:57,642
You rotten little bastard!

438
00:45:05,926 --> 00:45:07,154
Good evening, Mr. Deltoid.

439
00:45:07,428 --> 00:45:09,055
Good evening, Sergeant.

440
00:45:09,363 --> 00:45:10,455
They're in room B, sir.

441
00:45:10,731 --> 00:45:12,358
Thank you very much.

442
00:45:13,367 --> 00:45:14,527
Sergeant--

443
00:45:14,768 --> 00:45:15,666
Good evening, Mr. Deltoid.

444
00:45:15,969 --> 00:45:17,436
Good evening, Inspector.

445
00:45:17,671 --> 00:45:20,572
-Would you like your tea now, sir?
-No, thank you, Sergeant.
We'll have it later

446
00:45:20,874 --> 00:45:22,774
-May I have some paper towels, please?
-Yes, sir.

447
00:45:23,076 --> 00:45:25,374
We're interrogating the prisoner now.

448
00:45:25,579 --> 00:45:29,174
-Perhaps you'd care to come inside.
-Thank you very much.

449
00:45:29,783 --> 00:45:32,752
Good evening, Sergeant.
Good evening, all.

450
00:45:34,755 --> 00:45:37,883
Oh, dear! This boy
does look a mess, doesn't he?

451
00:45:38,091 --> 00:45:39,956
Just look at the state of him.

452
00:45:40,194 --> 00:45:42,162
Love's young nightmare-like.

453
00:45:42,463 --> 00:45:44,294
Violence makes violence.

454
00:45:44,598 --> 00:45:46,589
He resisted his lawful arrestors.

455
00:45:48,101 --> 00:45:51,400
This is the end of the line for me.

456
00:45:51,605 --> 00:45:54,768
The end of the line, yes.

457
00:45:55,108 --> 00:45:56,598
And what of me, brother sir?

458
00:45:56,810 --> 00:45:58,505
Speak up for me.
I'm not so bad.

459
00:45:58,779 --> 00:46:00,770
I was led on by
the treachery of others.

460
00:46:01,014 --> 00:46:03,915
Sings the roof off lovely,
he does, sir.

461
00:46:04,117 --> 00:46:07,416
Where are my treacherous droogs?
Get them before they get away!

462
00:46:07,621 --> 00:46:09,486
It was all their idea, brothers.

463
00:46:09,723 --> 00:46:12,419
They forced me to do it.
I'm innocent!

464
00:46:19,132 --> 00:46:21,828
You are now a murderer,
little Alex.

465
00:46:22,603 --> 00:46:23,831
A murderer.

466
00:46:24,705 --> 00:46:26,696
Not true, sir.

467
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:28,737
It was only a slight tolchok.

468
00:46:28,942 --> 00:46:31,502
She were breathing, I swear it.

469
00:46:31,945 --> 00:46:34,140
I've just come from the hospital.

470
00:46:34,448 --> 00:46:36,712
Your victim has died.

471
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:40,147
You try to frighten me.
Admit so, sir.

472
00:46:40,354 --> 00:46:42,345
This is some new form of torture.

473
00:46:42,623 --> 00:46:45,854
-Say it, brother sir.
-It'll be your own torture.

474
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:49,959
I hope to God
it'll torture you to madness.

475
00:46:51,765 --> 00:46:54,859
If you'd care to give him a bash
in the chops, don't mind us.

476
00:46:55,135 --> 00:46:56,864
We'll hold him down.

477
00:46:57,638 --> 00:47:00,835
He must be a great
disappointment to you, sir.

478
00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:33,899
This is the real weepy and tragic
part of the story beginning...

479
00:47:34,207 --> 00:47:36,402
... O my brothers and only friends.

480
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:39,110
After a trial,
with judges and a jury...

481
00:47:39,379 --> 00:47:43,611
...and hard words spoken against
your friend and humble narrator...

482
00:47:43,917 --> 00:47:48,013
...he was sentenced to 14 years
in Staja Number 84-F...

483
00:47:48,221 --> 00:47:51,782
...among smelly perverts
and hardened prestoopniks.

484
00:47:52,092 --> 00:47:55,892
The shock sending my dada beating
his bruised and krovvy rookers...

485
00:47:56,096 --> 00:47:58,428
...against unfair Bog
in His Heaven.

486
00:47:58,699 --> 00:48:01,896
And my mum boo-hoo-hooing
in her mother's grief...

487
00:48:02,135 --> 00:48:04,535
...at her only child
and son of her bosom...

488
00:48:04,805 --> 00:48:07,399
...like, letting everybody down
real horrorshow.

489
00:48:07,641 --> 00:48:10,542
Morning.
One up from Thames, mister.

490
00:48:09,242 --> 00:48:10,243
One up from Thames, sir.

491
00:48:11,612 --> 00:48:13,204
Right! Open up the cell!

492
00:48:13,447 --> 00:48:14,846
Yes, sir.

493
00:48:31,164 --> 00:48:33,428
Good morning, sir. Here are
the prisoner's committal forms.

494
00:48:33,667 --> 00:48:35,157
Thank you, mister.

495
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:39,466
-Name?
-Alexander DeLarge.

496
00:48:39,773 --> 00:48:41,673
You are now in H. M. Prison Parkmoor.

497
00:48:41,975 --> 00:48:45,467
From this moment, you will address
all prison officers as "sir. "

498
00:48:45,746 --> 00:48:46,576
Name?

499
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:49,146
Alexander DeLarge, sir.

500
00:48:49,449 --> 00:48:50,438
Sentence?

501
00:48:50,751 --> 00:48:51,877
14 years, sir.

502
00:48:52,152 --> 00:48:52,982
Crime?

503
00:48:53,286 --> 00:48:54,378
Murder, sir.

504
00:48:54,688 --> 00:48:57,589
Right.
Take the cuffs off him, mister.

505
00:49:08,902 --> 00:49:11,302
You are now 655321.

506
00:49:11,605 --> 00:49:14,802
It is your duty to memorize that number.

507
00:49:15,108 --> 00:49:17,099
Thank you, mister. Well done.

508
00:49:17,377 --> 00:49:19,106
-Thank you.
-Let the officer out.

509
00:49:23,383 --> 00:49:25,874
All right, empty your pockets.

510
00:49:29,623 --> 00:49:32,717
Are you able to see the white line
painted on the floor...

511
00:49:32,993 --> 00:49:34,324
...directly behind you...

512
00:49:34,528 --> 00:49:35,893
... 655321?

513
00:49:36,028 --> 00:49:37,493
Yes, sir.

514
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:40,320
Then your toes belong...

515
00:49:40,033 --> 00:49:42,024
...on the other side of it!

516
00:49:49,042 --> 00:49:50,737
-Yes, sir.
-Right.

517
00:49:51,144 --> 00:49:52,509
Carry on.

518
00:49:57,350 --> 00:49:58,317
Pick that up...

519
00:49:58,552 --> 00:50:01,316
...and put it down properly.

520
00:50:12,065 --> 00:50:14,158
One half-bar of chocolate.

521
00:50:16,169 --> 00:50:19,070
One bunch of keys
on white metal ring.

522
00:50:22,175 --> 00:50:24,075
One packet of cigarettes.

523
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,373
Two plastic ball pens.

524
00:50:29,683 --> 00:50:31,742
One black, one red.

525
00:50:34,955 --> 00:50:38,186
One pocket comb, black plastic.

526
00:50:38,759 --> 00:50:43,253
One address book, imitation red leather.

527
00:50:52,005 --> 00:50:53,973
One ten-penny piece.

528
00:50:55,408 --> 00:50:58,002
One white metal wristlet watch...

529
00:50:58,311 --> 00:51:02,270
...Timawrist, on a white metal expanding bracelet.

530
00:51:03,416 --> 00:51:05,384
Anything else in your pockets?

531
00:51:06,419 --> 00:51:07,909
-No, sir.
-Right.

532
00:51:08,221 --> 00:51:11,281
Sign here for your valuable property.

533
00:51:20,133 --> 00:51:22,226
The tobacco and chocolate you brought in...

534
00:51:22,435 --> 00:51:23,732
...you lose that...

535
00:51:24,004 --> 00:51:26,131
...as you are now convicted.

536
00:51:27,007 --> 00:51:30,238
Now over to the table and get undressed.

537
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:39,241
Were you in police custody this morning?

538
00:51:39,519 --> 00:51:40,952
-Yes, sir.
-One jacket, blue pinstriped.

539
00:51:41,254 --> 00:51:42,312
Prison custody?

540
00:51:42,556 --> 00:51:43,648
Yes, sir, on remand.

541
00:51:43,857 --> 00:51:45,757
-One necktie, blue.
-Religion?

542
00:51:45,959 --> 00:51:47,051
C. of E., sir.

543
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:49,022
Do you mean the Church of England?

544
00:51:49,262 --> 00:51:51,025
Yes, sir.
The Church of England, sir.

545
00:51:51,264 --> 00:51:52,253
Brown hair, isn't it?

546
00:51:52,465 --> 00:51:53,659
Fair hair, sir.

547
00:51:53,934 --> 00:51:54,958
Blue eyes?

548
00:51:55,168 --> 00:51:56,567
Blue, sir.

549
00:51:56,837 --> 00:51:59,431
Do you wear eyeglasses
or contact lenses?

550
00:51:59,673 --> 00:52:00,537
No, sir.

551
00:52:00,774 --> 00:52:02,674
One shirt, blue.
Collar attached.

552
00:52:02,976 --> 00:52:06,673
Have you been receiving medical
treatment for any serious illness?

553
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:09,471
-No, sir.
-One pair of boots, black leather.
Zippered. Worn.

554
00:52:09,783 --> 00:52:12,274
-Have you ever had any mental illness?
-No, sir.

555
00:52:12,686 --> 00:52:16,383
-Do you wear any false teeth
or any false limbs?
-No, sir.

556
00:52:16,857 --> 00:52:18,882
One pair of trousers,
blue pinstriped.

557
00:52:19,159 --> 00:52:22,492
-Have you ever had any attacks
of fainting or dizziness?
-No, sir.

558
00:52:22,696 --> 00:52:24,288
One pair of socks, black.

559
00:52:24,497 --> 00:52:26,294
-Are you an epileptic?
-No, sir.

560
00:52:26,566 --> 00:52:29,057
One pair of underpants,
white with blue waistband.

561
00:52:29,302 --> 00:52:32,999
Are you now, or have you ever been,
a homosexual?

562
00:52:33,473 --> 00:52:34,303
-No, sir.
-Right.

563
00:52:34,574 --> 00:52:37,099
-The mothballs, mister.
-Mothballs, sir.

564
00:52:38,011 --> 00:52:39,478
Now then, face the wall...

565
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:42,508
... bend over and touch your toes.

566
00:52:49,122 --> 00:52:50,680
-Any venereal disease?
-No, sir.

567
00:52:50,924 --> 00:52:52,482
-Crabs?
-No, sir.
-Lice?
-No, sir.

568
00:52:52,692 --> 00:52:55,718
-Through there for the bath.
-Yes, sir.
-One for a bath.

569
00:52:57,731 --> 00:52:59,028
What's it going to be, eh?

570
00:52:59,933 --> 00:53:03,425
Is it going to be in and out
of institutions like this...

571
00:53:03,637 --> 00:53:05,628
...though more in than out
for most of you?

572
00:53:05,906 --> 00:53:10,002
Or are you going to attend
to the divine word...

573
00:53:10,243 --> 00:53:13,940
...and realize the punishments
that await unrepentant sinners...

574
00:53:14,247 --> 00:53:16,340
...in the next world
as well as this?

575
00:53:16,549 --> 00:53:18,608
And what idiots you are...

576
00:53:18,852 --> 00:53:23,516
...selling your birthright
for a saucer of cold porridge.

577
00:53:23,757 --> 00:53:25,452
The thrill of theft.

578
00:53:25,759 --> 00:53:26,555
Of violence.

579
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,456
The urge to live easy.

580
00:53:29,729 --> 00:53:32,357
Well, I ask you what is it worth...

581
00:53:32,632 --> 00:53:35,032
...when we have undeniable proof...

582
00:53:35,268 --> 00:53:38,362
...yes, incontrovertible
evidence...

583
00:53:38,571 --> 00:53:39,936
...that hell exists?

584
00:53:40,173 --> 00:53:41,367
I know!

585
00:53:41,675 --> 00:53:44,166
I know, my friends.

586
00:53:44,444 --> 00:53:46,537
I have been informed...

587
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:48,270
...in visions...

588
00:53:48,548 --> 00:53:50,038
...that there is a place...

589
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:52,650
...darker than any prison...

590
00:53:52,953 --> 00:53:56,980
... hotter than any flame
of human fire...

591
00:53:57,257 --> 00:53:58,554
...where souls...

592
00:53:58,792 --> 00:54:02,990
...of unrepentant criminal sinners
like yourselves--

593
00:54:04,898 --> 00:54:08,595
Don't you laugh, damn you!
Don't you laugh.

594
00:54:08,802 --> 00:54:11,794
I say, like yourselves...

595
00:54:12,305 --> 00:54:13,670
...scream...

596
00:54:14,074 --> 00:54:17,703
...in endless and
unendurable agony.

597
00:54:18,478 --> 00:54:19,809
Their skin...

598
00:54:20,113 --> 00:54:22,604
... rotting and peeling.

599
00:54:22,816 --> 00:54:24,613
A fireball...

600
00:54:24,818 --> 00:54:27,184
...spinning in their
screaming guts!

601
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:30,821
I know. Yes, I know!

602
00:54:31,624 --> 00:54:33,615
Silence!

603
00:54:34,627 --> 00:54:36,618
Listen to the priest!

604
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:40,122
All right, you lot!
We'll end by singing hymn 258...

605
00:54:40,433 --> 00:54:41,730
...in the prisoner's hymnal.

606
00:54:42,002 --> 00:54:45,199
And let's have a little reverence,
you bastards!

607
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:50,139
I was a wandering sheep

608
00:54:51,211 --> 00:54:53,839
-Sing up, damn you!
-I did not love the fold

609
00:54:54,114 --> 00:54:55,513
Louder!

610
00:54:57,851 --> 00:55:02,845
I did not love my shepherd's voice

611
00:55:03,456 --> 00:55:07,859
I would not be controlled

612
00:55:09,029 --> 00:55:10,121
Louder!

613
00:55:10,563 --> 00:55:13,623
It had not been edifying.
Indeed not.

614
00:55:13,867 --> 00:55:17,769
Being in this hellhole
and human zoo for two years now.

615
00:55:18,038 --> 00:55:21,166
Being kicked and tolchoked
by brutal warders...

616
00:55:21,374 --> 00:55:24,366
...and meeting leering criminals
and perverts...

617
00:55:24,644 --> 00:55:26,168
...ready to dribble all over...

618
00:55:26,379 --> 00:55:29,348
...a luscious young malchick
like your storyteller.

619
00:55:35,355 --> 00:55:36,845
It was my rabbit...

620
00:55:37,157 --> 00:55:39,853
... to help the prison charlie
with the Sunday service.

621
00:55:40,093 --> 00:55:43,153
He was a bolshy,
great burly bastard.

622
00:55:43,396 --> 00:55:46,490
But he was very fond of myself,
me being very young...

623
00:55:46,699 --> 00:55:50,100
...and also now very interested
in the Big Book.

624
00:56:11,224 --> 00:56:15,024
I read all about the scourging
and the crowning with thorns.

625
00:56:15,295 --> 00:56:17,195
And I could viddy myself
helping in...

626
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:21,389
...and even taking charge of
the tolchoking and the nailing in.

627
00:56:21,634 --> 00:56:24,933
Being dressed in the height
of Roman fashion.

628
00:56:36,916 --> 00:56:39,407
I didn't so much like
the latter part of the Book...

629
00:56:39,652 --> 00:56:41,813
... which is more like
all preachy talking...

630
00:56:42,122 --> 00:56:44,215
... than fighting
and the old in-out.

631
00:56:44,457 --> 00:56:47,551
I like the parts where these old
yahoodies tolchok each other...

632
00:56:47,827 --> 00:56:50,057
...and then drink
their Hebrew vino...

633
00:56:50,463 --> 00:56:53,557
...and getting onto the bed
with their wives' handmaidens.

634
00:56:53,766 --> 00:56:55,757
That kept me going.

635
00:57:27,167 --> 00:57:30,000
"Seek not to be like evil men.

636
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:32,597
Neither desire to be with them...

637
00:57:32,805 --> 00:57:35,968
... because their minds
studieth robberies...

638
00:57:36,209 --> 00:57:39,110
...and their lips speak deceits. "

639
00:57:39,379 --> 00:57:42,815
If thou lose hope, being weary
in the days of distress...

640
00:57:43,116 --> 00:57:45,380
...thy strength
shall be diminished.

641
00:57:45,618 --> 00:57:47,279
Fine, my son. Fine.

642
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,817
Father?

643
00:57:52,825 --> 00:57:54,520
I have tried, have I not?

644
00:57:54,827 --> 00:57:55,919
You have, my son.

645
00:57:56,196 --> 00:57:58,494
-I've done my best, have I not?
-Indeed.

646
00:57:58,731 --> 00:58:02,132
I've never been guilty of any
institutional infraction, have I?

647
00:58:02,335 --> 00:58:06,704
You certainly have not, 655321.
You've been very helpful.

648
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:09,841
And you've shown
a genuine desire to reform.

649
00:58:10,043 --> 00:58:11,340
Father...

650
00:58:12,845 --> 00:58:15,643
...can I ask you
a question in private?

651
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:19,150
Certainly, my son. Certainly.

652
00:58:29,362 --> 00:58:31,853
Is there something
troubling you, my son?

653
00:58:35,034 --> 00:58:37,332
Don't be shy to speak up.

654
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:41,170
Remember...

655
00:58:41,374 --> 00:58:43,365
... I know of the...

656
00:58:43,576 --> 00:58:47,444
... urges that can
trouble young men...

657
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,238
...deprived...

658
00:58:49,449 --> 00:58:51,440
...of the society of women.

659
00:58:54,354 --> 00:58:56,686
It's nothing like that, Father.

660
00:59:00,393 --> 00:59:03,794
It's about this new thing
they're all talking about.

661
00:59:04,364 --> 00:59:05,991
About this new treatment.

662
00:59:06,266 --> 00:59:08,598
It gets you out of prison
in no time.

663
00:59:08,901 --> 00:59:11,392
And makes sure you
never get back in again.

664
00:59:12,272 --> 00:59:14,467
Where did you hear about this?

665
00:59:14,707 --> 00:59:17,403
Who's been talking
about these things?

666
00:59:17,710 --> 00:59:20,110
These things get around.

667
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:22,610
Two warders talk, as it might be.

668
00:59:22,882 --> 00:59:25,908
And somebody can't help
overhearing what they say.

669
00:59:26,419 --> 00:59:29,820
Then somebody picks up a scrap
of newspaper in the workshops...

670
00:59:30,089 --> 00:59:32,717
...and the newspaper
tells all about it.

671
00:59:35,628 --> 00:59:39,325
How about putting me in
for this new treatment, Father?

672
00:59:40,933 --> 00:59:44,630
I take it you are referring...

673
00:59:44,904 --> 00:59:47,134
...to the Ludovico technique.

674
00:59:47,907 --> 00:59:50,239
I don't know what it's called, Father.

675
00:59:50,443 --> 00:59:52,343
All I know is that it
gets you out quickly...

676
00:59:52,645 --> 00:59:55,113
...and makes sure you
never get back in again.

677
00:59:55,815 --> 00:59:58,648
That is not proven, 655321.

678
00:59:58,951 --> 01:00:03,047
In fact, it is only in the
experimental stage at this moment.

679
01:00:03,523 --> 01:00:06,321
It has been used, hasn't it?

680
01:00:06,526 --> 01:00:09,324
It has not been used
in this prison yet.

681
01:00:09,562 --> 01:00:11,962
The governor has grave
doubts about it.

682
01:00:12,265 --> 01:00:15,962
And I've heard there are
very serious dangers involved.

683
01:00:17,937 --> 01:00:20,838
I don't care about the dangers.

684
01:00:22,475 --> 01:00:24,670
I just want to be good.

685
01:00:25,945 --> 01:00:28,573
I want for the rest
of my life to be...

686
01:00:28,848 --> 01:00:30,941
...one act of goodness.

687
01:00:31,184 --> 01:00:32,651
The question is...

688
01:00:33,052 --> 01:00:37,682
...whether or not this technique
really makes a man good.

689
01:00:38,491 --> 01:00:40,857
Goodness comes from within.

690
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:42,186
Goodness...

691
01:00:42,462 --> 01:00:43,793
...is chosen.

692
01:00:44,197 --> 01:00:46,290
When a man cannot choose...

693
01:00:46,566 --> 01:00:48,693
... he ceases to be a man.

694
01:00:50,503 --> 01:00:55,463
I don't understand about
the whys and wherefores, Father.

695
01:00:56,609 --> 01:00:59,578
I only know I want to be good.

696
01:01:01,714 --> 01:01:03,614
Be patient, my son.

697
01:01:03,816 --> 01:01:06,080
Put your trust in the Lord.

698
01:01:07,987 --> 01:01:11,582
Instruct Thy Son
and He shall refresh thee...

699
01:01:11,824 --> 01:01:14,725
...and shall give delight
to thy soul.

700
01:01:15,328 --> 01:01:16,590
Amen.

701
01:01:44,424 --> 01:01:46,358
-Mister!
-All present and correct, sir!

702
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:47,617
Right!

703
01:01:49,228 --> 01:01:51,253
All present and correct, sir!

704
01:02:46,919 --> 01:02:48,409
Prisoners, halt!

705
01:02:48,988 --> 01:02:50,580
Now pay attention!

706
01:02:51,290 --> 01:02:53,087
I want you in two lines...

707
01:02:53,292 --> 01:02:55,920
... up against that wall,
facing this way.

708
01:02:56,229 --> 01:02:57,719
Go on, move!

709
01:02:58,297 --> 01:02:59,229
Hurry up!

710
01:02:59,532 --> 01:03:00,794
Stop talking!

711
01:03:06,639 --> 01:03:09,199
Prisoners ready
for inspection, sir!

712
01:03:25,157 --> 01:03:26,351
How many to a cell?

713
01:03:26,659 --> 01:03:28,456
Four in this block, sir.

714
01:03:29,362 --> 01:03:31,660
Cram criminals together
and what do you get?

715
01:03:31,864 --> 01:03:35,027
Concentrated criminality.
Crime in the midst of punishment.

716
01:03:35,268 --> 01:03:38,965
I agree, sir. We need
larger prisons, more money.

717
01:03:39,171 --> 01:03:41,036
Not a chance, my dear fellow.

718
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:43,572
The government can't be
concerned any longer...

719
01:03:43,843 --> 01:03:45,538
...with outmoded
penalogical theories.

720
01:03:45,845 --> 01:03:49,474
Soon we may need all prison
space for political offenders.

721
01:03:49,682 --> 01:03:53,243
Common criminals are best dealt
with on a purely curative basis.

722
01:03:53,553 --> 01:03:56,181
Kill the criminal reflex,
that's all.

723
01:03:56,489 --> 01:03:58,684
Full implementation
in a year's time.

724
01:03:58,991 --> 01:04:01,186
Punishment means nothing to them.
You can see that.

725
01:04:01,394 --> 01:04:04,363
They enjoy their
so-called punishment.

726
01:04:04,664 --> 01:04:05,756
You're absolutely right, sir.

727
01:04:05,998 --> 01:04:08,592
Shut your bleeding hole!

728
01:04:09,268 --> 01:04:10,758
Who said that?

729
01:04:11,404 --> 01:04:12,803
I did, sir.

730
01:04:19,078 --> 01:04:20,773
What crime did you commit?

731
01:04:21,013 --> 01:04:23,106
The accidental killing
of a person, sir.

732
01:04:23,382 --> 01:04:26,078
He brutally murdered a woman
in furtherance of theft.

733
01:04:26,319 --> 01:04:27,911
Fourteen years, sir.

734
01:04:29,221 --> 01:04:30,415
Excellent.

735
01:04:31,924 --> 01:04:33,186
He's enterprising...

736
01:04:33,392 --> 01:04:34,416
...aggressive...

737
01:04:34,727 --> 01:04:35,887
...outgoing...

738
01:04:36,128 --> 01:04:36,924
...young...

739
01:04:37,229 --> 01:04:38,526
... bold...

740
01:04:38,731 --> 01:04:40,289
...vicious.

741
01:04:40,733 --> 01:04:41,791
He'll do.

742
01:04:42,034 --> 01:04:43,194
Fine.

743
01:04:43,436 --> 01:04:44,926
We could still look at C-block.

744
01:04:45,204 --> 01:04:47,229
No, no. That's enough.
He's perfect.

745
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,203
I want his records sent to me.

746
01:04:49,442 --> 01:04:50,739
This vicious young hoodlum...

747
01:04:51,043 --> 01:04:52,943
...will be transformed
out of all recognition.

748
01:04:53,212 --> 01:04:55,203
Thank you very much
for this chance, sir.

749
01:04:55,414 --> 01:04:58,212
Let's hope you make
the most of it, my boy.

750
01:04:58,451 --> 01:05:00,942
-Shall we go to my office?
-Thank you.

751
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:09,057
Come in.

752
01:05:10,863 --> 01:05:11,761
Sir!

753
01:05:11,964 --> 01:05:13,864
655321. Sir!

754
01:05:14,066 --> 01:05:15,055
Very good, Chief.

755
01:05:15,334 --> 01:05:16,858
Over to the line.
Toes behind it.

756
01:05:17,169 --> 01:05:19,637
Full name and number
to the governor.

757
01:05:20,473 --> 01:05:23,670
Alexander DeLarge, sir.
655321, sir.

758
01:05:26,379 --> 01:05:29,473
I don't suppose you know who
that was this morning.

759
01:05:29,749 --> 01:05:33,344
That was no less a personage
than the Minister of the Interior.

760
01:05:33,653 --> 01:05:35,587
The new Minister of the Interior.

761
01:05:35,855 --> 01:05:38,756
What they call a very new broom.

762
01:05:39,959 --> 01:05:43,360
These new ridiculous ideas
have come at last.

763
01:05:43,663 --> 01:05:45,893
And orders are orders...

764
01:05:46,165 --> 01:05:49,692
...though I may say to you
in confidence, I do not approve.

765
01:05:49,969 --> 01:05:52,199
An eye for an eye, I say.

766
01:05:52,505 --> 01:05:55,474
If someone hits you,
you hit back, do you not?

767
01:05:55,708 --> 01:05:59,405
Why should not the state,
severely hit by you hooligans...

768
01:05:59,679 --> 01:06:01,408
... not hit back also?

769
01:06:02,314 --> 01:06:04,282
The new view is to say " no. "

770
01:06:04,517 --> 01:06:07,884
The new view is that
we turn the bad into good.

771
01:06:08,187 --> 01:06:11,179
All of which seems to me
to be grossly unjust.

772
01:06:11,524 --> 01:06:14,015
Shut your filthy hole, you scum!

773
01:06:14,527 --> 01:06:16,722
You are to be reformed.

774
01:06:17,530 --> 01:06:20,021
Tomorrow you will go
to this man, Brodsky.

775
01:06:20,332 --> 01:06:21,890
You will be leaving here.

776
01:06:22,134 --> 01:06:26,400
You will be transferred to
the Ludovico medical facility.

777
01:06:26,706 --> 01:06:30,642
It's believed you'll be able to
leave state custody in a fortnight.

778
01:06:30,843 --> 01:06:32,743
I suppose that prospect pleases you?

779
01:06:33,045 --> 01:06:34,808
Answer the governor's question!

780
01:06:35,047 --> 01:06:36,412
Yes, sir.
Thank you very much.

781
01:06:36,649 --> 01:06:38,947
I've done my best here,
I really have, sir.

782
01:06:39,251 --> 01:06:41,446
I'm very grateful
to all concerned, sir.

783
01:06:43,723 --> 01:06:46,055
Sign this where it's marked.

784
01:06:49,261 --> 01:06:51,320
Don't read it, sign it!

785
01:06:51,564 --> 01:06:55,261
It says you're willing to have
your sentence commuted...

786
01:06:55,534 --> 01:06:58,469
...to submission to
the Ludovico treatment.

787
01:06:58,738 --> 01:07:00,069
And this.

788
01:07:07,246 --> 01:07:08,838
And another copy.

789
01:07:21,393 --> 01:07:23,258
The next morning I was taken to...

790
01:07:23,462 --> 01:07:25,191
... the Ludovico medical facility...

791
01:07:25,397 --> 01:07:27,262
... outside the town center.

792
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:28,967
I felt a malenky bit sad...

793
01:07:29,268 --> 01:07:31,099
...having to say goodbye
to the old Staja...

794
01:07:31,403 --> 01:07:34,702
...as you will, when you leave
a place you've gotten used to.

795
01:07:34,907 --> 01:07:36,898
Right, halt the prisoner.

796
01:07:42,381 --> 01:07:44,815
Good morning, sir.
I'm Chief Officer Barnes.

797
01:07:45,117 --> 01:07:46,880
I've got 655321...

798
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:50,782
...on a transfer from Parkmoor
to the Ludovico Centre, sir.

799
01:07:51,123 --> 01:07:53,717
Good morning.
Yes, we've been expecting you.

800
01:07:53,926 --> 01:07:55,223
I'm Dr. Alcot.

801
01:07:57,530 --> 01:07:58,519
Dr. Alcot.

802
01:07:58,798 --> 01:08:00,129
Very good, sir.

803
01:08:03,936 --> 01:08:06,996
-Are you prepared for the prisoner?
-Yes, of course.

804
01:08:07,239 --> 01:08:11,300
I wonder if you'd mind signing
these documents, sir.

805
01:08:12,144 --> 01:08:13,543
There, sir.

806
01:08:25,024 --> 01:08:26,457
And there, sir.

807
01:08:31,964 --> 01:08:33,454
And there.

808
01:08:52,451 --> 01:08:53,975
There you are.

809
01:08:56,155 --> 01:08:58,055
Prison escort, move forward!

810
01:09:01,193 --> 01:09:02,353
Halt!

811
01:09:04,463 --> 01:09:06,158
Excuse me, sir.

812
01:09:12,705 --> 01:09:15,970
Is that the officer who will
take charge of the prisoner?

813
01:09:25,517 --> 01:09:29,009
A word of advice, Doc.
You'll have to watch this one.

814
01:09:29,321 --> 01:09:32,813
A right brutal bastard he has been,
and will be again...

815
01:09:33,025 --> 01:09:36,222
...in spite of all his sucking up
and reading the Bible.

816
01:09:36,495 --> 01:09:40,124
We can manage things. Charlie, will
you show the young man to his room, now?

817
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:43,129
Right, sir. Come this way, please.

818
01:09:51,911 --> 01:09:54,505
-Morning, Charlie.
-Good morning, Doctor.

819
01:09:55,748 --> 01:09:56,737
Good morning, Alex.

820
01:09:57,049 --> 01:09:59,711
My name is Dr. Branom.
I'm Dr. Brodsky's assistant.

821
01:09:59,919 --> 01:10:01,511
Good morning, missus.
Lovely day, isn't it?

822
01:10:01,754 --> 01:10:03,016
Indeed, it is.

823
01:10:03,255 --> 01:10:04,847
May I take that?

824
01:10:08,527 --> 01:10:11,018
-How are you feeling this morning?
-Fine, fine.

825
01:10:11,263 --> 01:10:14,255
Good. In a few minutes
you'll meet Dr. Brodsky...

826
01:10:14,466 --> 01:10:15,763
...and begin your treatment.

827
01:10:16,368 --> 01:10:18,859
You're a very lucky boy
to have been chosen.

828
01:10:20,773 --> 01:10:23,367
I realize that,
and I'm very grateful.

829
01:10:23,742 --> 01:10:25,767
We're going to be friends,
aren't we?

830
01:10:26,078 --> 01:10:27,375
I hope so, missus.

831
01:10:30,549 --> 01:10:32,983
What's the hypo for?
Sending me to sleep?

832
01:10:33,185 --> 01:10:34,482
Nothing of the sort.

833
01:10:34,954 --> 01:10:37,650
-Vitamins will it be, then?
-Something like that.

834
01:10:38,190 --> 01:10:42,092
You're undernourished, so after
each meal we'll give you a shot.

835
01:10:42,394 --> 01:10:43,793
Roll over on your right side.

836
01:10:44,096 --> 01:10:46,894
Loosen your pajama pants
and pull them halfway down.

837
01:10:56,909 --> 01:10:59,901
What exactly is the treatment here
going to be, then?

838
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:02,811
It's quite simple, really.

839
01:11:03,415 --> 01:11:05,178
We're going to show you some films.

840
01:11:05,417 --> 01:11:07,783
You mean like
going to the pictures?

841
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:09,812
Something like that.

842
01:11:10,122 --> 01:11:10,918
That's good.

843
01:11:11,190 --> 01:11:13,988
I like to viddy
the old films now and again.

844
01:11:16,028 --> 01:11:18,496
And viddy films I would.

845
01:11:18,998 --> 01:11:20,989
Where I was taken to, brothers...

846
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:23,327
... was like no cine
I ever viddied before.

847
01:11:23,802 --> 01:11:25,929
I was bound up
in a straitjacket...

848
01:11:26,205 --> 01:11:28,332
...and my gulliver was strapped
to a headrest...

849
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:30,938
... with wires running away from it.

850
01:11:31,143 --> 01:11:33,509
Then they clamped, like,
lid-locks on me eyes...

851
01:11:33,712 --> 01:11:37,148
...so that I could not shut them,
no matter how hard I tried.

852
01:11:37,449 --> 01:11:39,144
It seemed a bit crazy to me...

853
01:11:39,451 --> 01:11:42,318
...but I let them get on with
what they wanted to get on with.

854
01:11:42,554 --> 01:11:45,955
If I was to be a free malchick
again in a fortnight...

855
01:11:46,158 --> 01:11:49,616
...I would put up with much
in the meantime, O my brothers.

856
01:12:15,087 --> 01:12:18,386
The first film was a very good,
professional piece of cine...

857
01:12:18,690 --> 01:12:20,590
...like it was done in Hollywood.

858
01:12:20,859 --> 01:12:22,986
The sounds were real horrorshow.

859
01:12:23,195 --> 01:12:26,392
You could slooshy the screams
and moans very realistic.

860
01:12:26,665 --> 01:12:28,895
You could even get
the breathing and panting...

861
01:12:29,201 --> 01:12:32,170
... of the tolchocking malchicks
at the same time.

862
01:12:32,404 --> 01:12:34,269
And then what do you know?

863
01:12:34,506 --> 01:12:36,667
Soon our dear old friend...

864
01:12:36,909 --> 01:12:38,900
... the red, red vino on tap...

865
01:12:39,178 --> 01:12:40,304
... the same in all places...

866
01:12:40,512 --> 01:12:42,002
...like it's put out
by the same firm...

867
01:12:42,581 --> 01:12:44,208
...began to flow.

868
01:12:44,416 --> 01:12:46,577
It was beautiful.

869
01:12:46,919 --> 01:12:49,217
It's funny how the colors
of the real world...

870
01:12:49,721 --> 01:12:51,518
... only seem really real...

871
01:12:51,790 --> 01:12:53,917
... when you viddy them
on a screen.

872
01:12:56,929 --> 01:12:59,329
Now, all the time
I was watching this...

873
01:12:59,598 --> 01:13:01,828
...I was beginning
to get very aware...

874
01:13:02,134 --> 01:13:04,295
... of, like, not feeling
all that well.

875
01:13:04,536 --> 01:13:08,438
And this I put down
to all the rich food and vitamins.

876
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:12,940
But I tried to forget this,
concentrating on the next film...

877
01:13:13,245 --> 01:13:15,907
... which jumped right away
on a young devotchka...

878
01:13:16,148 --> 01:13:18,946
... who was being given
the old in-out, in-out...

879
01:13:19,918 --> 01:13:21,943
... first by one malchick...

880
01:13:22,821 --> 01:13:23,947
... then another.

881
01:13:25,057 --> 01:13:26,547
Then another.

882
01:13:29,561 --> 01:13:31,961
When it came to
the 6th or 7th malchick...

883
01:13:32,264 --> 01:13:35,722
...leering and smecking
and then going into it...

884
01:13:35,968 --> 01:13:39,165
...I began to feel really sick.

885
01:13:39,771 --> 01:13:42,262
But I could not shut me glazzies.

886
01:13:42,574 --> 01:13:45,975
And even if I tried to move
my glazzballs about...

887
01:13:46,245 --> 01:13:48,236
...I still could not get out of...

888
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:51,176
... the line of fire
of this picture.

889
01:13:53,886 --> 01:13:55,478
Get me up.

890
01:13:55,854 --> 01:13:57,651
I'm going to be sick.

891
01:13:58,657 --> 01:14:00,682
Get something for me to be sick in!

892
01:14:04,997 --> 01:14:07,864
Very soon now,
the drug will cause the subject...

893
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:10,295
...to experience
a deathlike paralysis...

894
01:14:10,602 --> 01:14:14,402
...together with deep feelings
of terror and helplessness.

895
01:14:15,307 --> 01:14:19,107
One of our early test subjects
described it as being like death.

896
01:14:19,311 --> 01:14:22,303
A sense of stifling or drowning.

897
01:14:23,015 --> 01:14:25,711
And it is during this period,
we have found...

898
01:14:25,984 --> 01:14:29,613
...the subject will make
his most rewarding associations...

899
01:14:29,821 --> 01:14:33,621
... between his catastrophic
experience, environment...

900
01:14:33,892 --> 01:14:36,884
...and the violence he sees.

901
01:14:38,697 --> 01:14:40,688
Dr. Brodsky is pleased with you.

902
01:14:40,999 --> 01:14:43,331
You've made
a very positive response.

903
01:14:44,436 --> 01:14:48,338
Tomorrow there will be two
sessions, morning and afternoon.

904
01:14:48,540 --> 01:14:51,634
You mean I have to viddy
two sessions in one day?

905
01:14:51,843 --> 01:14:55,006
I imagine you'll feel a bit
limp by the end of the day.

906
01:14:55,247 --> 01:14:58,546
But we have to be hard on you.
You have to be cured.

907
01:14:58,850 --> 01:14:59,908
It was horrible.

908
01:15:00,152 --> 01:15:01,710
Of course it was horrible.

909
01:15:01,954 --> 01:15:04,354
Violence is a very horrible thing.

910
01:15:04,656 --> 01:15:06,351
That's what you're learning now.

911
01:15:06,558 --> 01:15:07,855
Your body's learning it.

912
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:11,224
I just don't understand about
feeling sick the way I did.

913
01:15:11,463 --> 01:15:14,728
I never used to feel sick.
I used to feel the very opposite.

914
01:15:14,967 --> 01:15:17,868
Doing it or watching it,
I used to feel real horrorshow.

915
01:15:18,770 --> 01:15:22,262
You felt ill this afternoon
because you're getting better.

916
01:15:22,541 --> 01:15:25,669
When we're healthy,
we respond to the hateful...

917
01:15:25,944 --> 01:15:27,935
...with fear and nausea.

918
01:15:28,180 --> 01:15:30,375
You're becoming healthy,
that's all.

919
01:15:30,582 --> 01:15:32,482
By this time tomorrow,
you'll be healthier still.

920
01:16:26,305 --> 01:16:28,330
It was the next day, brothers...

921
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:30,098
...and I had truly done my best...

922
01:16:30,342 --> 01:16:32,742
...morning and afternoon
to play it their way...

923
01:16:33,045 --> 01:16:35,843
...and sit like a horrorshow
cooperative malchick...

924
01:16:36,048 --> 01:16:37,606
...in the chair of torture...

925
01:16:37,849 --> 01:16:42,047
... while they flashed nasty bits
of ultra-violence on the screen...

926
01:16:42,521 --> 01:16:47,015
... though not on the soundtrack,
the only sound being music.

927
01:16:47,959 --> 01:16:50,553
Then I noticed,
in all my pain and sickness...

928
01:16:50,829 --> 01:16:54,731
... what music it was
that, like, cracked and boomed.

929
01:16:55,667 --> 01:16:58,158
It was Ludwig van.

930
01:16:58,670 --> 01:17:01,230
Ninth Symphony, fourth movement.

931
01:17:16,888 --> 01:17:19,982
Stop it! Stop it!
Please, I beg you!

932
01:17:20,492 --> 01:17:21,686
It's a sin!

933
01:17:22,094 --> 01:17:23,686
It's a sin!

934
01:17:29,201 --> 01:17:30,259
Sin?

935
01:17:30,502 --> 01:17:32,094
What's all this about sin?

936
01:17:32,604 --> 01:17:33,502
That!

937
01:17:33,705 --> 01:17:37,698
Using Ludwig van like that.
He did no harm to anyone.

938
01:17:38,009 --> 01:17:40,409
Beethoven just wrote music.

939
01:17:41,079 --> 01:17:44,276
Are you referring
to the background score?

940
01:17:45,817 --> 01:17:47,785
You've heard Beethoven before?

941
01:17:49,921 --> 01:17:51,889
So you're keen on music?

942
01:17:57,229 --> 01:17:59,026
Can't be helped.

943
01:17:59,731 --> 01:18:02,529
Here's the punishment
element perhaps.

944
01:18:03,535 --> 01:18:05,696
The governor ought to be pleased.

945
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:10,408
I'm sorry, Alex.

946
01:18:10,709 --> 01:18:12,404
This is for your own good.

947
01:18:12,644 --> 01:18:15,044
You'll have to bear with us
for a while.

948
01:18:15,847 --> 01:18:19,544
But it's not fair.
It's not fair I should feel ill...

949
01:18:19,751 --> 01:18:22,720
...when I hear lovely,
lovely Ludwig van.

950
01:18:23,255 --> 01:18:25,553
You must take your chance, boy.

951
01:18:26,057 --> 01:18:28,548
The choice has been all yours.

952
01:18:30,061 --> 01:18:32,757
You needn't take it
any further, sir.

953
01:18:33,131 --> 01:18:36,066
You've proved to me all this
ultra-violence and killing...

954
01:18:36,334 --> 01:18:39,565
...is wrong, wrong
and terribly wrong!

955
01:18:39,971 --> 01:18:41,768
I've learned me lesson, sir.

956
01:18:41,973 --> 01:18:44,874
I see now what I've
never seen before.

957
01:18:45,143 --> 01:18:48,078
I'm cured. Praise God!

958
01:18:48,380 --> 01:18:50,780
You're not cured yet, boy.

959
01:18:51,683 --> 01:18:53,150
But, sirs.

960
01:18:53,385 --> 01:18:54,750
Missus!

961
01:18:55,086 --> 01:18:57,179
I see that it's wrong!

962
01:18:57,456 --> 01:19:01,483
It's wrong because
it's, like, against society.

963
01:19:01,793 --> 01:19:04,387
Because everybody has the
right to live and be happy...

964
01:19:04,663 --> 01:19:07,461
...without being
tolchocked and knifed!

965
01:19:07,766 --> 01:19:10,792
No, no, boy.
You really must leave it to us.

966
01:19:11,102 --> 01:19:12,694
But be cheerful about it.

967
01:19:13,004 --> 01:19:16,269
In less than a fortnight now,
you'll be a free man.

968
01:19:54,646 --> 01:19:55,908
Ladies and gentlemen...

969
01:19:56,147 --> 01:19:59,048
...at this stage, we introduce
the subject himself.

970
01:19:59,251 --> 01:20:02,220
He is, as you will perceive,
fit and well-nourished.

971
01:20:02,521 --> 01:20:05,354
He comes straight from a night's
sleep and a good breakfast...

972
01:20:05,557 --> 01:20:06,546
... undrugged...

973
01:20:06,825 --> 01:20:08,656
... unhypnotized.

974
01:20:08,860 --> 01:20:12,557
Tomorrow we send him out with
confidence into the world again...

975
01:20:12,831 --> 01:20:16,460
...as decent a lad as you
would meet on a May morning.

976
01:20:17,269 --> 01:20:20,033
What a change is here,
ladies and gentlemen.

977
01:20:20,272 --> 01:20:22,672
From the hoodlum the state committed...

978
01:20:22,874 --> 01:20:25,672
...to unprofitable punishment two years ago.

979
01:20:25,877 --> 01:20:28,675
Unchanged after two years.

980
01:20:29,381 --> 01:20:31,576
Unchanged, do I say?

981
01:20:31,883 --> 01:20:33,350
Not quite.

982
01:20:33,585 --> 01:20:38,284
Prison taught him the false smile,
the rubbed hands of hypocrisy.

983
01:20:38,590 --> 01:20:41,889
The fawning, greased, obsequious leer.

984
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:44,191
Other vices it taught him...

985
01:20:44,462 --> 01:20:48,364
...as well as confirming him in
those he had long practiced before.

986
01:20:49,568 --> 01:20:52,594
Our party promised
to restore law and order...

987
01:20:52,871 --> 01:20:56,898
...and to make the streets safe for
the ordinary peace-loving citizen.

988
01:20:57,208 --> 01:21:01,201
This pledge is now
about to become a reality.

989
01:21:01,413 --> 01:21:05,110
Ladies and gentlemen, today is an historic moment.

990
01:21:05,417 --> 01:21:09,911
The problem of criminal violence
is soon to be a thing of the past.

991
01:21:10,922 --> 01:21:12,822
But enough of words.

992
01:21:13,124 --> 01:21:15,319
Actions speak louder than.

993
01:21:15,594 --> 01:21:17,289
Action now.

994
01:21:17,729 --> 01:21:19,720
Observe all.

995
01:21:29,341 --> 01:21:31,935
Our necks are out
a long way on this, Minister.

996
01:21:32,143 --> 01:21:34,236
I have complete faith in Brodsky.

997
01:21:34,512 --> 01:21:37,640
If the polls are right,
we have nothing to lose.

998
01:21:46,825 --> 01:21:49,157
Hello, heap of dirt.

999
01:21:51,963 --> 01:21:56,263
You don't wash much, do you,
judging by the horrible smell.

1000
01:21:56,835 --> 01:21:59,269
Why do you say that?
I had a shower this morning.

1001
01:21:59,471 --> 01:22:02,167
He had a shower this morning.

1002
01:22:02,641 --> 01:22:04,666
You trying to call me a liar?

1003
01:22:04,976 --> 01:22:05,772
No, brother.

1004
01:22:06,177 --> 01:22:09,271
You must think I'm awfully stupid.

1005
01:22:14,953 --> 01:22:16,784
Why did you do that, brother?

1006
01:22:16,988 --> 01:22:18,956
I've never done wrong to you.

1007
01:22:19,190 --> 01:22:21,283
You want to know why I did that?

1008
01:22:21,693 --> 01:22:22,682
Well, you see...

1009
01:22:22,994 --> 01:22:24,188
... I do this...

1010
01:22:24,496 --> 01:22:25,690
...and that...

1011
01:22:25,997 --> 01:22:29,194
...and this because I don't like
your horrible type, do I?

1012
01:22:29,401 --> 01:22:31,699
And if you want to start something...

1013
01:22:32,003 --> 01:22:34,494
...you just go ahead.
Go on!

1014
01:22:34,706 --> 01:22:35,968
Please do!

1015
01:22:37,609 --> 01:22:39,406
I'm going to be sick.

1016
01:22:40,211 --> 01:22:41,906
You're going to be sick, are you?

1017
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:44,580
I'm going to be sick.
Please let me get up.

1018
01:22:45,316 --> 01:22:46,908
You want to get up?

1019
01:22:47,318 --> 01:22:49,013
Well, now you listen to me.

1020
01:22:49,721 --> 01:22:51,313
If you want to get up...

1021
01:22:51,823 --> 01:22:53,723
...you've got to do something for me.

1022
01:22:54,492 --> 01:22:55,618
Here.

1023
01:22:56,127 --> 01:22:57,321
Here.

1024
01:22:57,996 --> 01:22:59,623
You see that?

1025
01:23:00,632 --> 01:23:02,099
You see that shoe?

1026
01:23:03,501 --> 01:23:04,900
I want you to lick it.

1027
01:23:05,136 --> 01:23:06,433
Go on!

1028
01:23:07,505 --> 01:23:08,995
Lick it!

1029
01:23:12,043 --> 01:23:14,409
And, O my brothers, would you believe...

1030
01:23:14,646 --> 01:23:18,013
... your faithful friend
and long-suffering narrator...

1031
01:23:18,249 --> 01:23:20,615
...pushed out his red yabzick a mile and a half...

1032
01:23:20,852 --> 01:23:23,719
... to lick the grahzny, vonny boots.

1033
01:23:24,522 --> 01:23:25,546
And again!

1034
01:23:25,757 --> 01:23:28,225
The horrible killing sickness had whooshed up...

1035
01:23:28,460 --> 01:23:30,052
...and turned the joy of battle...

1036
01:23:30,862 --> 01:23:33,524
...into a feeling I was going to snuff it.

1037
01:23:33,765 --> 01:23:35,062
And again.

1038
01:23:35,567 --> 01:23:37,558
Nice and clean.

1039
01:23:40,238 --> 01:23:41,364
Thank you very much.

1040
01:23:41,573 --> 01:23:43,438
That will do very well.

1041
01:23:47,645 --> 01:23:49,943
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.

1042
01:25:00,451 --> 01:25:02,112
She came towards me...

1043
01:25:02,353 --> 01:25:06,119
... with the light, like it was the
light of heavenly grace.

1044
01:25:06,357 --> 01:25:08,552
And the thing that flashed in me gulliver...

1045
01:25:08,860 --> 01:25:11,454
... was that I'd like to have her
there on the floor...

1046
01:25:11,663 --> 01:25:14,962
... with the old in-out, real savage.

1047
01:25:30,982 --> 01:25:33,382
But quick as a shot came the sickness.

1048
01:25:33,685 --> 01:25:36,176
Like a detective who'd been
watching around the corner...

1049
01:25:36,988 --> 01:25:39,684
...and now followed to make his arrest.

1050
01:25:52,804 --> 01:25:53,702
Enough!

1051
01:25:54,005 --> 01:25:55,700
Thank you very much.

1052
01:25:55,907 --> 01:25:57,704
Thank you, my dear.

1053
01:26:19,530 --> 01:26:22,192
Not feeling too bad now, are you?

1054
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:24,898
No, sir.
I feel really great, sir.

1055
01:26:25,103 --> 01:26:27,037
-Good.
-Was it all right, sir?

1056
01:26:27,238 --> 01:26:28,102
Did I do well?

1057
01:26:28,339 --> 01:26:31,706
Fine, my boy.
Absolutely fine.

1058
01:26:31,943 --> 01:26:33,205
You see, ladies and gentlemen...

1059
01:26:33,444 --> 01:26:35,912
...our subject is impelled towards the good...

1060
01:26:36,214 --> 01:26:39,809
... by paradoxically being impelled towards evil.

1061
01:26:40,118 --> 01:26:41,745
The intention to act violently...

1062
01:26:42,053 --> 01:26:45,454
...is accompanied by strong
feelings of physical distress.

1063
01:26:45,723 --> 01:26:48,351
To counter these,
the subject has to switch...

1064
01:26:48,626 --> 01:26:51,561
...to a diametrically opposed attitude.

1065
01:26:52,263 --> 01:26:53,628
Any questions?

1066
01:26:53,865 --> 01:26:55,264
Choice!

1067
01:26:58,770 --> 01:27:02,262
The boy has no real choice, has he?

1068
01:27:02,473 --> 01:27:04,065
Self-interest.

1069
01:27:04,342 --> 01:27:06,173
The fear of physical pain...

1070
01:27:06,444 --> 01:27:10,972
...drove him to that grotesque act of self-abasement.

1071
01:27:11,749 --> 01:27:13,774
Its insincerity was clearly to be seen.

1072
01:27:13,985 --> 01:27:15,885
He ceases to be a wrongdoer.

1073
01:27:16,154 --> 01:27:20,750
He ceases also to be a creature capable of moral choice.

1074
01:27:20,992 --> 01:27:23,290
Padre, these are subtleties.

1075
01:27:23,594 --> 01:27:26,688
We're not concerned with motives, with the higher ethics.

1076
01:27:26,998 --> 01:27:30,695
We are concerned only
with cutting down crime.

1077
01:27:32,971 --> 01:27:37,601
And with relieving the ghastly
congestion in our prisons.

1078
01:27:38,109 --> 01:27:40,600
He will be your true Christian...

1079
01:27:40,878 --> 01:27:42,971
...ready to turn the other cheek.

1080
01:27:43,181 --> 01:27:46,207
Ready to be crucified, rather than crucify.

1081
01:27:46,417 --> 01:27:50,513
Sick to the very heart at the
thought even of killing a fly.

1082
01:27:50,822 --> 01:27:52,187
Reclamation.

1083
01:27:52,423 --> 01:27:54,618
Joy before the angels of God.

1084
01:27:54,892 --> 01:27:58,020
The point is that it works!

1085
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:05,733
And the very next day,
your friend and humble narrator...

1086
01:28:06,004 --> 01:28:08,029
... was a free man.

1087
01:28:14,740 --> 01:28:19,940
I wanna marry a lighthouse keeper and keep him company.

1088
01:28:19,940 --> 01:28:24,040
I want to marry a lighthouse keeper and live by the sight of the sea.

1089
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:28,740
I'll polish his lamp by the light of day,
so ships at night can find their way.

1090
01:28:28,740 --> 01:28:34,140
I wanna marry a lighthouse keeper and won't that be OK?

1091
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:39,240
We'll have parties on the coral reef and clambakes on the shore.

1092
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:43,540
We'll invite the neighbors in, seagulls by the score.

1093
01:28:43,540 --> 01:28:48,540
I dream of live in a lighthouse baby every single day.

1094
01:28:46,444 --> 01:28:47,877
Son!

1095
01:28:49,447 --> 01:28:51,779
Hi, hi, hi there, my Pee and Em.

1096
01:28:53,084 --> 01:28:54,346
Mum.

1097
01:28:56,087 --> 01:28:58,487
How are you, love?
Nice to see you.

1098
01:29:00,191 --> 01:29:02,489
-Dad.
-Lad. What a surprise.

1099
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:04,853
-Good to see you.
-Keeping fit?

1100
01:29:05,596 --> 01:29:06,858
How are you, then?

1101
01:29:07,098 --> 01:29:09,191
I'm fine, fine.

1102
01:29:09,467 --> 01:29:11,401
Keeping out of trouble, you know.

1103
01:29:14,205 --> 01:29:15,900
I'm back!

1104
01:29:18,609 --> 01:29:19,598
Good to see you.

1105
01:29:19,911 --> 01:29:23,074
Why didn't you let us know
what was happening?

1106
01:29:23,414 --> 01:29:26,508
I wanted it to be, like,
a big surprise for you and Pee.

1107
01:29:26,818 --> 01:29:29,719
It's a surprise, all right.
A bit bewildering too.

1108
01:29:29,921 --> 01:29:32,788
We've only just read about it
in morning papers.

1109
01:29:33,024 --> 01:29:34,821
You should have let us know, lad.

1110
01:29:35,493 --> 01:29:39,429
Not that we're not very pleased
to see you again, and all...

1111
01:29:39,730 --> 01:29:41,129
...cured too, eh?

1112
01:29:41,432 --> 01:29:43,491
That's right.
They did a great job on me.

1113
01:29:43,801 --> 01:29:46,395
I'm completely reformed.

1114
01:29:50,108 --> 01:29:51,803
Still the same old place, then?

1115
01:30:04,322 --> 01:30:07,155
There's a strange fellow
sitting on the sofa...

1116
01:30:07,425 --> 01:30:10,519
... munchy-wunching
lomticks of toast.

1117
01:30:13,531 --> 01:30:15,328
That's Joe.

1118
01:30:17,268 --> 01:30:19,168
He lives here now.

1119
01:30:19,470 --> 01:30:20,767
The lodger.

1120
01:30:21,038 --> 01:30:22,665
That's what he is.

1121
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:25,031
He rents your room.

1122
01:30:35,686 --> 01:30:37,176
How do you do, Joe?

1123
01:30:37,455 --> 01:30:39,480
Find the room comfortable, do you?

1124
01:30:39,690 --> 01:30:41,681
No complaints?

1125
01:30:44,795 --> 01:30:46,660
I've heard about you.

1126
01:30:47,698 --> 01:30:49,461
I know what you've done.

1127
01:30:53,804 --> 01:30:57,467
Breaking the hearts of your
poor, grieving parents.

1128
01:30:58,476 --> 01:31:00,205
So you're back, eh?

1129
01:31:00,478 --> 01:31:05,108
Back to make life a misery for
your lovely parents once more?

1130
01:31:05,416 --> 01:31:06,883
Over my dead corpse, you will.

1131
01:31:07,185 --> 01:31:10,484
Because, you see, they've let me
be more like a son to them...

1132
01:31:10,688 --> 01:31:12,679
...than like a lodger.

1133
01:31:14,225 --> 01:31:16,819
Don't go fighting here, boys.

1134
01:31:22,700 --> 01:31:24,531
Do put your hand over your mouth, please.

1135
01:31:24,835 --> 01:31:26,029
It's bloody revolting.

1136
01:31:31,542 --> 01:31:33,134
Are you all right?

1137
01:31:34,345 --> 01:31:36,006
It's the treatment.

1138
01:31:36,247 --> 01:31:38,841
It's disgusting.
Enough to put you off your food.

1139
01:31:39,116 --> 01:31:42,916
Leave him be, Joe.
It's the treatment.

1140
01:31:45,022 --> 01:31:47,855
Do you think we ought
to do something?

1141
01:31:48,859 --> 01:31:52,226
Would you like me to make you
a nice cup of tea, son?

1142
01:32:02,974 --> 01:32:06,068
What have you done
with all me own personal things?

1143
01:32:10,381 --> 01:32:13,145
That was all...

1144
01:32:13,384 --> 01:32:15,045
...took away, son.

1145
01:32:15,586 --> 01:32:17,383
By the police.

1146
01:32:17,788 --> 01:32:19,756
New regulation, see...

1147
01:32:19,991 --> 01:32:23,051
...about compensation
for the victims.

1148
01:32:25,696 --> 01:32:27,391
What about Basil?

1149
01:32:30,401 --> 01:32:32,096
Where is my snake?

1150
01:32:42,413 --> 01:32:43,607
He met with...

1151
01:32:43,814 --> 01:32:45,611
...like, an accident.

1152
01:32:49,620 --> 01:32:51,087
He passed away.

1153
01:32:56,427 --> 01:32:58,520
What's going to happen to me, then?

1154
01:33:00,798 --> 01:33:02,026
I mean...

1155
01:33:03,134 --> 01:33:04,601
...that's my room he's in.

1156
01:33:04,835 --> 01:33:06,700
There's no denying that.

1157
01:33:07,738 --> 01:33:10,332
This is my home also.

1158
01:33:12,243 --> 01:33:15,701
What suggestions have you,
my Pee and Em, to make?

1159
01:33:21,652 --> 01:33:24,212
All this needs thinking about, son.

1160
01:33:25,456 --> 01:33:28,323
We can't very well
just kick Joe out.

1161
01:33:28,559 --> 01:33:30,356
Not just like that, can we?

1162
01:33:30,661 --> 01:33:31,650
I mean...

1163
01:33:31,962 --> 01:33:33,862
...Joe's here doing a job.

1164
01:33:34,165 --> 01:33:36,463
A contract it is.
Two years.

1165
01:33:36,667 --> 01:33:40,364
We made, like, an arrangement.
Didn't we, Joe?

1166
01:33:42,173 --> 01:33:44,141
You see, son...

1167
01:33:45,476 --> 01:33:48,968
...Joe's paid next month's
rent already...

1168
01:33:50,581 --> 01:33:53,379
...so whatever we may do in
the future, we can't just say...

1169
01:33:53,651 --> 01:33:56,643
...to Joe to get out, now can we?

1170
01:33:57,054 --> 01:33:58,885
No, but it's much more than that.

1171
01:33:59,790 --> 01:34:02,190
I mean, I've got you two
to think of...

1172
01:34:02,493 --> 01:34:05,360
...who've been like
a father and mother to me.

1173
01:34:05,596 --> 01:34:08,588
It wouldn't be right for me
to go off and leave you two...

1174
01:34:08,866 --> 01:34:11,699
...to the tender mercies
of this young monster...

1175
01:34:12,002 --> 01:34:15,199
...who's been like no real son at all.

1176
01:34:15,906 --> 01:34:18,204
Look, he's weeping now.

1177
01:34:18,409 --> 01:34:21,401
But that's all his craft and artfulness.

1178
01:34:21,712 --> 01:34:24,510
Let him go and find
a room somewhere else.

1179
01:34:24,715 --> 01:34:29,015
Let him learn the errors
of his way, and that a bad boy...

1180
01:34:29,286 --> 01:34:32,778
...doesn't deserve such a good
mum and dad as he's had.

1181
01:34:38,429 --> 01:34:39,726
All right.

1182
01:34:40,831 --> 01:34:42,731
I know how things are now.

1183
01:34:44,235 --> 01:34:46,795
I've suffered and I've suffered...

1184
01:34:47,037 --> 01:34:49,028
...and I've suffered.

1185
01:34:49,740 --> 01:34:52,937
And everybody wants me to go on suffering.

1186
01:34:54,912 --> 01:34:57,039
You've made others suffer.

1187
01:34:57,548 --> 01:35:00,745
It's only right that you should suffer proper.

1188
01:35:01,652 --> 01:35:03,313
I've been told everything you've done...

1189
01:35:03,554 --> 01:35:05,545
...sitting around the family table.

1190
01:35:05,756 --> 01:35:08,850
And pretty shocking it was to listen to.

1191
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:12,957
It made me real sick,
a lot of it did.

1192
01:35:14,965 --> 01:35:18,526
Now look what you've gone
and done to your mother.

1193
01:35:18,769 --> 01:35:20,361
Come on. It's all right now.

1194
01:35:33,350 --> 01:35:34,476
Right!

1195
01:35:35,252 --> 01:35:36,947
I'm leaving now.

1196
01:35:37,188 --> 01:35:39,349
You won't ever viddy me no more.

1197
01:35:39,590 --> 01:35:41,285
I'll make me own way.

1198
01:35:41,792 --> 01:35:45,387
Thank you very much. Let it lie
heavy on your consciences.

1199
01:35:46,797 --> 01:35:49,698
Now don't take it like that, son.

1200
01:36:51,962 --> 01:36:54,931
Can you spare some cutter,
me brother?

1201
01:36:56,767 --> 01:36:59,861
Can you spare some cutter,
me brother?

1202
01:37:03,541 --> 01:37:06,567
Can you spare some cutter,
me brother?

1203
01:37:27,898 --> 01:37:29,388
Thanks, brother.

1204
01:37:47,318 --> 01:37:49,115
Jamey! Mack!

1205
01:37:49,620 --> 01:37:51,087
May the hokey fly!

1206
01:37:51,422 --> 01:37:54,983
Mother of God and all the blessed
saints in heaven preserve us!

1207
01:37:56,627 --> 01:37:58,720
I never forget a face, me God!

1208
01:37:58,996 --> 01:38:00,395
I never forget any face.

1209
01:38:00,598 --> 01:38:03,396
Leave me alone, brother.
I've never seen you before!

1210
01:38:03,634 --> 01:38:07,092
This is the poisonous young swine
that near done me in.

1211
01:38:07,338 --> 01:38:08,498
Him and his friends.

1212
01:38:08,806 --> 01:38:11,639
They beat me and kicked me
and punched me.

1213
01:38:11,942 --> 01:38:13,432
Stop him! Stop him!

1214
01:38:13,644 --> 01:38:17,603
They laughed at me blood
and me moans, this murderous dog!

1215
01:38:17,848 --> 01:38:21,306
Then there was like
a sea of dirty, smelly old men...

1216
01:38:21,452 --> 01:38:23,545
... trying to get at
your humble narrator...

1217
01:38:23,821 --> 01:38:27,518
... with their feeble rookers
and horny old claws.

1218
01:38:27,758 --> 01:38:30,522
It was old age having a go at youth.

1219
01:38:31,261 --> 01:38:34,458
And I daren't do a single
solitary thing, O my brothers.

1220
01:38:34,832 --> 01:38:36,823
It being better
to be hit at like that...

1221
01:38:37,034 --> 01:38:39,628
... than want to sick
and feel that horrible pain.

1222
01:38:39,870 --> 01:38:41,269
All right, all right!

1223
01:38:41,538 --> 01:38:42,436
Stop it now!

1224
01:38:42,673 --> 01:38:46,040
Come on. Stop breaking the
state's peace, you naughty boys!

1225
01:38:46,343 --> 01:38:49,141
Back away! Go away with you!

1226
01:38:49,380 --> 01:38:51,678
What's your trouble, sir?

1227
01:38:52,891 --> 01:38:55,682
Oh, no!

1228
01:38:59,289 --> 01:39:00,688
Well!

1229
01:39:01,358 --> 01:39:03,792
Well, well, well!

1230
01:39:07,698 --> 01:39:10,292
If it isn't little Alex.

1231
01:39:10,501 --> 01:39:11,866
Long time no viddy, droog.

1232
01:39:12,102 --> 01:39:13,569
How goes?

1233
01:39:13,804 --> 01:39:15,066
It's impossible.

1234
01:39:15,305 --> 01:39:16,567
I don't believe it.

1235
01:39:16,807 --> 01:39:18,672
Evidence of the old glazzies.

1236
01:39:18,909 --> 01:39:20,706
Nothing up our sleeves.

1237
01:39:20,978 --> 01:39:23,003
No magic, little Alex.

1238
01:39:23,213 --> 01:39:26,705
A job for two who are now of job age.

1239
01:39:27,084 --> 01:39:28,517
The police.

1240
01:39:44,234 --> 01:39:45,428
Come on, Alex.

1241
01:39:45,736 --> 01:39:47,226
Come for walking.

1242
01:39:58,849 --> 01:40:01,249
Come, come, come,
my little droogies.

1243
01:40:01,518 --> 01:40:03,042
I just don't get this at all.

1244
01:40:03,253 --> 01:40:05,448
The old days are dead and gone.

1245
01:40:05,723 --> 01:40:08,556
For what I did in the past,
I've been punished.

1246
01:40:08,859 --> 01:40:10,520
I've been cured.

1247
01:40:10,761 --> 01:40:11,955
That was read out to us.

1248
01:40:12,229 --> 01:40:14,060
The inspector read it all out to us.

1249
01:40:14,264 --> 01:40:17,028
He said it was a very good way.

1250
01:40:17,234 --> 01:40:18,462
But what is all this?

1251
01:40:18,769 --> 01:40:21,260
It was them that went for me, brothers.

1252
01:40:21,538 --> 01:40:24,166
You're not on their side, and can't be.

1253
01:40:24,775 --> 01:40:26,936
You can't be, Dim.

1254
01:40:27,177 --> 01:40:29,873
It was someone we fillied with
back in the old days...

1255
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:33,572
...trying to get his own revenge
after all this time. Remember?

1256
01:40:33,784 --> 01:40:35,251
A long time is right.

1257
01:40:35,486 --> 01:40:37,784
I don't remember them days too horrorshow.

1258
01:40:37,988 --> 01:40:40,081
And don't call me Dim no more, either.

1259
01:40:40,290 --> 01:40:42,383
Officer, call me.

1260
01:40:42,760 --> 01:40:46,196
Enough is remembered, though, little Alex.

1261
01:40:46,797 --> 01:40:49,891
And this is to make sure you stay cured.

1262
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:46,948
That's enough.

1263
01:41:47,224 --> 01:41:49,852
A bit more. He's still kicking.

1264
01:42:08,679 --> 01:42:10,579
Cured, are you?

1265
01:42:12,182 --> 01:42:16,050
Be viddying you some more sometime, droogie.

1266
01:42:31,368 --> 01:42:35,304
Where was I to go,
who had no home and no money?

1267
01:42:35,572 --> 01:42:37,802
I cried for meself.

1268
01:42:38,108 --> 01:42:40,906
Home, home, home.

1269
01:42:41,178 --> 01:42:43,009
It was home I was wanting.

1270
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:46,272
And it was home
I came to, brothers...

1271
01:42:46,516 --> 01:42:49,212
...not realizing,
in the state I was in...

1272
01:42:49,419 --> 01:42:52,411
... where I was
and had been before.

1273
01:43:40,637 --> 01:43:42,628
Who on earth could that be?

1274
01:43:58,188 --> 01:43:59,883
I'll see who it is.

1275
01:44:11,468 --> 01:44:12,992
Yes, what is it?

1276
01:44:21,678 --> 01:44:22,872
Please ...

1277
01:44:39,730 --> 01:44:43,029
Frank, I think this young man needs some help.

1278
01:44:47,804 --> 01:44:49,203
My God!

1279
01:44:50,207 --> 01:44:52,402
What's happened to you, my boy?

1280
01:44:54,845 --> 01:44:58,542
And would you believe it,
O my brothers and only friends...

1281
01:44:58,815 --> 01:45:01,045
... there was your faithful narrator...

1282
01:45:01,351 --> 01:45:03,751
...being held helpless like a babe in arms...

1283
01:45:04,021 --> 01:45:06,353
...and suddenly realizing where he was...

1284
01:45:06,656 --> 01:45:10,057
...and why "home" on the gate
had looked so familiar.

1285
01:45:10,327 --> 01:45:12,056
But I knew I was safe.

1286
01:45:12,329 --> 01:45:14,354
I knew he would not remember me.

1287
01:45:14,564 --> 01:45:16,361
For in those carefree days...

1288
01:45:16,566 --> 01:45:18,466
...I and my so-called droogs...

1289
01:45:18,735 --> 01:45:22,227
... wore our maskies, which were
like real horrorshow disguises.

1290
01:45:23,573 --> 01:45:24,733
Police.

1291
01:45:28,378 --> 01:45:30,573
Ghastly, horrible police...

1292
01:45:32,582 --> 01:45:34,174
...they beat me up, sir.

1293
01:45:38,455 --> 01:45:40,855
The police beat me up.

1294
01:45:42,893 --> 01:45:44,588
I know you!

1295
01:45:48,799 --> 01:45:50,892
Isn't it your picture in the newspapers?

1296
01:45:51,201 --> 01:45:53,396
Didn't I see you on the video this morning?

1297
01:45:53,603 --> 01:45:56,970
Are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique?

1298
01:45:57,274 --> 01:45:58,502
Yes, sir.

1299
01:45:59,009 --> 01:46:02,206
That's exactly who I am and
what I am, sir. A victim.

1300
01:46:02,412 --> 01:46:05,575
Then, by God, you've been
sent here by providence!

1301
01:46:05,816 --> 01:46:08,910
Tortured in prison, then
tortured by the police.

1302
01:46:09,119 --> 01:46:13,613
My heart goes out to you.
You're not the first to come here.

1303
01:46:13,924 --> 01:46:16,791
The police like to bring
their victims to this village.

1304
01:46:17,027 --> 01:46:18,426
But it's providential that you...

1305
01:46:18,728 --> 01:46:22,220
...who are also another kind
of victim, should come here.

1306
01:46:24,134 --> 01:46:27,126
But you're cold and shivering.

1307
01:46:27,737 --> 01:46:29,102
Julian...

1308
01:46:29,339 --> 01:46:31,603
...draw a bath for this young man.

1309
01:46:31,842 --> 01:46:33,139
Certainly, Frank.

1310
01:46:33,543 --> 01:46:35,135
Thank you very much, sir.

1311
01:46:35,445 --> 01:46:37,037
God bless you, sir.

1312
01:47:32,002 --> 01:47:34,300
He can be the most potent
weapon imaginable...

1313
01:47:34,504 --> 01:47:37,701
...to ensure the government
is not returned in the election.

1314
01:47:37,974 --> 01:47:39,703
The government's big boast, sir...

1315
01:47:40,010 --> 01:47:42,706
...is the way they have dealt with crime:

1316
01:47:42,979 --> 01:47:44,810
Recruiting young roughs
into the police...

1317
01:47:45,015 --> 01:47:48,109
... proposing will-sapping
techniques of conditioning.

1318
01:47:48,385 --> 01:47:50,580
We've seen it before
in other countries.

1319
01:47:50,820 --> 01:47:52,310
The thin end of the wedge.

1320
01:47:52,522 --> 01:47:56,618
Before we know it, we'll have the
full apparatus of totalitarianism.

1321
01:48:00,730 --> 01:48:05,099
This young boy is a living witness
to these diabolical proposals.

1322
01:48:05,335 --> 01:48:09,101
The people, the common people, must know, must see.

1323
01:48:09,339 --> 01:48:13,708
There are traditions of liberty to
defend. That tradition is all.

1324
01:48:13,944 --> 01:48:15,912
The common people will let it go, yes.

1325
01:48:16,146 --> 01:48:18,239
They'll sell liberty for a quieter life.

1326
01:48:18,548 --> 01:48:20,038
That is why they must be led.

1327
01:48:20,350 --> 01:48:22,409
Driven. Pushed.

1328
01:48:27,457 --> 01:48:28,754
Fine.

1329
01:48:29,759 --> 01:48:31,420
Thank you very much, sir.

1330
01:48:33,463 --> 01:48:35,021
He'll be here.

1331
01:48:38,268 --> 01:48:41,567
I'm singing in the rain

1332
01:48:42,272 --> 01:48:45,264
Just singing in the rain

1333
01:48:46,076 --> 01:48:49,273
What a glorious feeling

1334
01:48:49,646 --> 01:48:53,047
I'm hap-hap-happy again

1335
01:48:53,583 --> 01:48:56,746
I'm laughing at clouds

1336
01:48:57,554 --> 01:49:00,079
So dark up above

1337
01:49:01,091 --> 01:49:03,582
The sun's in my heart

1338
01:49:04,394 --> 01:49:08,296
I'm ready for love

1339
01:49:09,266 --> 01:49:11,996
Let the stormy clouds chase

1340
01:49:12,602 --> 01:49:15,469
Everyone from the place

1341
01:49:16,973 --> 01:49:21,910
Come on with the rain
I've a smile on my face

1342
01:49:22,579 --> 01:49:25,571
I'll walk down the lane

1343
01:49:25,240 --> 01:49:28,740
With a happy refrain

1344
01:49:28,740 --> 01:49:36,040
And I'm singing

1345
01:49:59,816 --> 01:50:01,215
Good evening, sir.

1346
01:50:05,155 --> 01:50:06,713
Good evening.

1347
01:50:07,257 --> 01:50:10,124
It was very kind of you
to leave this out for me.

1348
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:12,760
There was no one around, so I started.

1349
01:50:13,029 --> 01:50:14,860
Hope that's all right, sir.

1350
01:50:18,368 --> 01:50:20,063
Of course.

1351
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,298
Food all right?

1352
01:50:59,075 --> 01:51:00,702
Great, sir. Great.

1353
01:51:03,713 --> 01:51:05,908
Try the wine.

1354
01:51:12,322 --> 01:51:13,687
Thank you, sir.

1355
01:51:16,292 --> 01:51:17,520
Cheers.

1356
01:51:19,596 --> 01:51:20,790
Happy days.

1357
01:51:31,307 --> 01:51:33,639
Won't you join me?

1358
01:51:34,344 --> 01:51:36,539
No. My health doesn't allow it.

1359
01:51:37,414 --> 01:51:38,745
No, thank you.

1360
01:51:44,721 --> 01:51:47,212
"1960, Chateau...

1361
01:51:47,724 --> 01:51:49,624
...Saint-Estephe.

1362
01:51:49,859 --> 01:51:50,723
Medoc."

1363
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:51,927
Very good brand, sir.

1364
01:52:00,637 --> 01:52:01,661
Very good...

1365
01:52:01,938 --> 01:52:03,132
...color, sir.

1366
01:52:07,343 --> 01:52:09,072
Smells nice too.

1367
01:52:23,993 --> 01:52:25,984
Very nice little number.

1368
01:52:27,263 --> 01:52:28,594
Here's to it.

1369
01:52:37,307 --> 01:52:39,798
Very refreshing, sir.
Very refreshing.

1370
01:52:40,109 --> 01:52:43,010
I'm pleased you appreciate good wine.

1371
01:52:44,113 --> 01:52:46,013
Have another glass.

1372
01:52:59,195 --> 01:53:00,526
My wife...

1373
01:53:01,998 --> 01:53:05,525
... used to do everything for me
and leave me to my writing.

1374
01:53:08,438 --> 01:53:10,030
Your wife? Is she away?

1375
01:53:10,507 --> 01:53:12,839
She's dead!

1376
01:53:16,913 --> 01:53:18,744
I'm sorry to hear about that, sir.

1377
01:53:19,048 --> 01:53:21,346
She was very badly raped, you see.

1378
01:53:21,651 --> 01:53:24,051
We were assaulted by vicious young hoodlums...

1379
01:53:24,254 --> 01:53:26,654
...in this very room you're sitting in now.

1380
01:53:26,856 --> 01:53:31,555
I was left a helpless cripple,
but for her the agony was too great.

1381
01:53:31,961 --> 01:53:33,826
The doctors said
it was pneumonia...

1382
01:53:34,063 --> 01:53:36,861
... because it happened later,
during a flu epidemic.

1383
01:53:37,166 --> 01:53:41,364
The doctors told me it was
pneumonia, but I knew what it was.

1384
01:53:41,671 --> 01:53:46,040
A victim of the modern age.
Poor, poor girl!

1385
01:53:49,979 --> 01:53:51,571
And now you.

1386
01:53:52,181 --> 01:53:55,241
Another victim of the modern age.

1387
01:53:55,552 --> 01:53:57,452
But you can be helped.

1388
01:53:58,488 --> 01:54:01,889
I phoned some friends while
you were having your bath.

1389
01:54:02,191 --> 01:54:02,987
Some...

1390
01:54:03,259 --> 01:54:04,351
...friends?

1391
01:54:04,594 --> 01:54:06,084
Yes. They want to help you.

1392
01:54:06,396 --> 01:54:08,591
-Help me?
-Help you.

1393
01:54:08,898 --> 01:54:12,390
-Who are they?
-Very, very important people.

1394
01:54:12,602 --> 01:54:15,002
And they're interested in you.

1395
01:54:20,510 --> 01:54:22,705
Julian. This'll be these people now.

1396
01:54:22,912 --> 01:54:26,313
I don't want to trouble you
any further. I should be leaving.

1397
01:54:27,417 --> 01:54:29,385
No trouble at all.

1398
01:54:30,086 --> 01:54:31,280
Here.

1399
01:54:31,521 --> 01:54:33,421
Let me fill your glass.

1400
01:54:59,148 --> 01:55:00,843
So this is the young man.

1401
01:55:02,251 --> 01:55:03,718
How do you do, sir?

1402
01:55:04,053 --> 01:55:06,715
Missus.
I'm very pleased to meet you.

1403
01:55:07,123 --> 01:55:09,557
I hope you forgive us for coming at this hour...

1404
01:55:09,826 --> 01:55:11,657
... but we heard you were in trouble...

1405
01:55:11,961 --> 01:55:14,225
...and so we came over to see if we could help.

1406
01:55:14,464 --> 01:55:16,762
Very kind of you, sir.
Thank you very much.

1407
01:55:16,966 --> 01:55:19,230
I understand you had a rather...

1408
01:55:19,469 --> 01:55:20,731
... unfortunate...

1409
01:55:20,970 --> 01:55:22,460
...encounter...

1410
01:55:22,739 --> 01:55:24,468
...with the police tonight.

1411
01:55:24,741 --> 01:55:26,766
Yes, I suppose you could call it that.

1412
01:55:27,076 --> 01:55:28,338
How are you feeling now?

1413
01:55:28,645 --> 01:55:29,873
Much better, thank you.

1414
01:55:30,146 --> 01:55:32,478
Feel like talking, answering a few questions?

1415
01:55:32,782 --> 01:55:34,079
Fine, sir. Fine.

1416
01:55:34,951 --> 01:55:37,579
As I said, we've heard about you.

1417
01:55:38,087 --> 01:55:40,783
We are interested in your case.

1418
01:55:40,990 --> 01:55:43,891
-We want to help you.
-Thank you very much, sir.

1419
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:47,288
Shall we get down to it?

1420
01:55:47,497 --> 01:55:49,294
Fine. Fine, sir.

1421
01:55:54,604 --> 01:55:57,402
The newspapers mentioned...

1422
01:55:57,607 --> 01:56:01,907
...in addition to being conditioned
against acts of sex and violence...

1423
01:56:02,178 --> 01:56:05,511
...you've inadvertently been
conditioned against music.

1424
01:56:06,582 --> 01:56:09,608
I think that was something
that they didn't plan for.

1425
01:56:09,986 --> 01:56:11,886
You see, missus...

1426
01:56:12,121 --> 01:56:15,613
... I'm very fond of music.
Especially Beethoven.

1427
01:56:16,726 --> 01:56:18,694
Ludwig van Beethoven.

1428
01:56:18,928 --> 01:56:21,294
-B-E-...
-All right, thank you.

1429
01:56:21,798 --> 01:56:25,825
And it just so happened that
while they were showing me...

1430
01:56:26,135 --> 01:56:30,037
...a particularly bad film
of, like, a concentration camp...

1431
01:56:30,306 --> 01:56:33,833
...the background music
was playing Beethoven.

1432
01:56:34,043 --> 01:56:36,841
So now you have
the same reaction to music...

1433
01:56:37,046 --> 01:56:38,843
...as you do to sex and violence?

1434
01:56:39,048 --> 01:56:43,417
No, missus. You see, it's not
all music. It's just the Ninth.

1435
01:56:43,653 --> 01:56:45,416
You mean Beethoven's Ninth Symphony?

1436
01:56:45,655 --> 01:56:48,647
That's right. I can't listen
to the Ninth anymore at all.

1437
01:56:48,925 --> 01:56:52,361
When I hear the Ninth, I get, like...

1438
01:56:52,662 --> 01:56:54,254
...this funny feeling.

1439
01:56:55,331 --> 01:56:59,563
And then all I can think about
is, like, trying to snuff it.

1440
01:56:59,869 --> 01:57:04,272
-I beg your pardon?
-Snuff it. Death, I mean.

1441
01:57:04,540 --> 01:57:07,065
I just want to die peacefully...

1442
01:57:07,577 --> 01:57:09,875
...like, with no pain.

1443
01:57:10,680 --> 01:57:12,580
Do you feel that way now?

1444
01:57:13,683 --> 01:57:15,674
No, sir, not exactly.

1445
01:57:15,885 --> 01:57:17,182
I still feel...

1446
01:57:17,386 --> 01:57:18,683
...very miserable.

1447
01:57:18,888 --> 01:57:21,448
Very much down in spirits.

1448
01:57:21,991 --> 01:57:23,288
Do you still feel...

1449
01:57:23,559 --> 01:57:25,049
...suicidal?

1450
01:57:28,297 --> 01:57:30,094
Well. Put it this way:

1451
01:57:30,366 --> 01:57:33,199
I feel very low in myself.

1452
01:57:34,003 --> 01:57:36,369
I can't see much in the future.

1453
01:57:36,606 --> 01:57:41,066
I feel that any second, something
terrible is going to happen to me.

1454
01:57:54,323 --> 01:57:55,984
Well done, Frank.

1455
01:58:01,998 --> 01:58:03,795
Julian, get the car, would you, please?

1456
01:58:24,420 --> 01:58:25,751
I woke up...

1457
01:58:31,327 --> 01:58:35,058
... the pain and sickness
all over me like an animal.

1458
01:58:43,139 --> 01:58:45,972
Then I realized what it was.

1459
01:58:47,276 --> 01:58:50,040
The music coming up
from the floor...

1460
01:58:50,279 --> 01:58:53,476
... was our old friend,
Ludwig van...

1461
01:58:53,783 --> 01:58:56,377
...and the dreaded Ninth Symphony.

1462
01:59:04,293 --> 01:59:05,692
Let me out!

1463
01:59:05,962 --> 01:59:07,691
Open the door!

1464
01:59:08,397 --> 01:59:10,558
Come on, open the door!

1465
01:59:13,102 --> 01:59:14,399
Turn it off!

1466
01:59:14,604 --> 01:59:16,401
Turn it off!

1467
01:59:23,312 --> 01:59:24,210
Stop it!

1468
02:00:12,528 --> 02:00:14,018
Turn it off!

1469
02:00:15,464 --> 02:00:16,431
Please!

1470
02:00:16,666 --> 02:00:18,861
Turn it off!

1471
02:00:32,782 --> 02:00:35,683
Suddenly, I viddied
what I had to do...

1472
02:00:35,952 --> 02:00:38,250
...and what I had wanted to do.

1473
02:00:38,654 --> 02:00:41,088
And that was to do myself in.

1474
02:00:41,490 --> 02:00:42,889
To snuff it.

1475
02:00:43,259 --> 02:00:46,592
To blast off forever,
out of this wicked, cruel world.

1476
02:00:48,197 --> 02:00:50,597
One moment of pain, perhaps...

1477
02:00:50,900 --> 02:00:52,663
...and then sleep.

1478
02:00:52,902 --> 02:00:55,462
Forever and ever...

1479
02:00:55,705 --> 02:00:57,002
...and ever.

1480
02:01:21,497 --> 02:01:23,226
I jumped, O my brothers...

1481
02:01:23,532 --> 02:01:24,931
...and I fell hard.

1482
02:01:25,201 --> 02:01:27,499
But I did not snuff it.

1483
02:01:28,104 --> 02:01:29,696
If I had snuffed it...

1484
02:01:29,939 --> 02:01:33,306
...I would not be here
to tell what I have told.

1485
02:01:35,144 --> 02:01:39,808
I came back to life
after a long, black, black gap...

1486
02:01:40,049 --> 02:01:43,348
... of what might have been
a million years.

1487
02:02:12,081 --> 02:02:14,641
He's recovered
consciousness, Doctor.

1488
02:02:54,723 --> 02:02:56,213
Hello, lad.

1489
02:02:56,525 --> 02:02:58,015
Hello, son.

1490
02:02:59,028 --> 02:03:00,427
How are you?

1491
02:03:01,630 --> 02:03:03,621
You feeling better?

1492
02:03:08,037 --> 02:03:09,129
What...

1493
02:03:09,338 --> 02:03:10,396
...gives...

1494
02:03:11,841 --> 02:03:13,832
... O my Pee and Em?

1495
02:03:14,743 --> 02:03:16,335
What makes...

1496
02:03:17,113 --> 02:03:18,011
...you think...

1497
02:03:18,314 --> 02:03:20,714
...you are welcome?

1498
02:03:23,652 --> 02:03:25,643
There, there, Mother.
It's all right.

1499
02:03:25,855 --> 02:03:27,516
He doesn't mean it.

1500
02:03:29,959 --> 02:03:32,450
You were in the papers again, son.

1501
02:03:33,262 --> 02:03:34,854
It said...

1502
02:03:35,131 --> 02:03:37,827
...they had done
great wrong to you.

1503
02:03:38,667 --> 02:03:40,032
It said...

1504
02:03:40,336 --> 02:03:41,633
... how the government...

1505
02:03:41,871 --> 02:03:43,862
...drove you to try...

1506
02:03:44,140 --> 02:03:45,664
...and do yourself in.

1507
02:03:47,543 --> 02:03:49,773
And when you think about it, son...

1508
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:53,542
... maybe it was our fault too...

1509
02:03:53,883 --> 02:03:55,145
...in a way.

1510
02:03:56,252 --> 02:03:58,152
Your home's your home...

1511
02:03:58,487 --> 02:04:01,047
...when all's said and done, son.

1512
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,560
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Doctor.

1513
02:04:22,511 --> 02:04:24,706
-How are you feeling today?
-Fine, fine.

1514
02:04:25,014 --> 02:04:26,106
Good. May I?

1515
02:04:26,515 --> 02:04:28,574
-I'm Dr. Taylor.
-Haven't seen you before.

1516
02:04:28,817 --> 02:04:30,114
I'm your psychiatrist.

1517
02:04:30,419 --> 02:04:32,284
Psychiatrist!
Do I need one?

1518
02:04:32,521 --> 02:04:34,011
Just part of hospital routine.

1519
02:04:34,223 --> 02:04:36,418
Are we going to
talk about me sex life?

1520
02:04:38,093 --> 02:04:40,084
I'm going to show you
some slides...

1521
02:04:40,329 --> 02:04:43,196
...and you're going to tell me
what you think about them.

1522
02:04:44,099 --> 02:04:45,031
Jolly good.

1523
02:04:47,136 --> 02:04:48,694
You know anything about dreams?

1524
02:04:49,138 --> 02:04:50,230
Something, yes.

1525
02:04:50,439 --> 02:04:52,236
-You know what they mean?
-Perhaps.

1526
02:04:52,441 --> 02:04:53,908
You concerned about something?

1527
02:04:54,243 --> 02:04:57,235
No, not concerned, really...

1528
02:04:57,546 --> 02:04:59,537
... but I've been having
this nasty dream.

1529
02:04:59,748 --> 02:05:01,238
Very nasty.

1530
02:05:01,517 --> 02:05:03,417
It's like...

1531
02:05:05,421 --> 02:05:07,548
...when I was all smashed up,
you know...

1532
02:05:07,856 --> 02:05:09,915
...and half-awake
and unconscious-like...

1533
02:05:10,159 --> 02:05:12,252
... I kept having this dream.

1534
02:05:12,528 --> 02:05:15,429
All these doctors were
playing around with me gulliver.

1535
02:05:15,631 --> 02:05:17,724
You know, like the inside
of me brain.

1536
02:05:17,967 --> 02:05:20,868
I seem to have this dream
over and over again.

1537
02:05:21,070 --> 02:05:23,231
Do you think it means anything?

1538
02:05:24,139 --> 02:05:28,576
Patients with injuries like yours
often have dreams of this sort.

1539
02:05:28,777 --> 02:05:30,870
It's all part
of the recovery process.

1540
02:05:32,147 --> 02:05:34,945
Now then, each of these slides
needs a reply...

1541
02:05:35,251 --> 02:05:37,242
...from one of the people
in the picture.

1542
02:05:37,453 --> 02:05:40,650
You tell me what you think
the person would say...

1543
02:05:40,889 --> 02:05:41,787
...all right?

1544
02:05:42,057 --> 02:05:43,490
Righty-right.

1545
02:05:45,461 --> 02:05:47,793
" Isn't the plumage beautiful? "

1546
02:05:49,098 --> 02:05:51,566
I just say what the
other person would say?

1547
02:05:55,704 --> 02:05:57,262
Don't think about it too long.

1548
02:05:57,506 --> 02:05:59,997
Say the first thing
that pops into your mind.

1549
02:06:02,678 --> 02:06:05,078
Cabbages. Knickers.

1550
02:06:06,215 --> 02:06:08,581
It's not got a beak.

1551
02:06:08,784 --> 02:06:10,081
Good.

1552
02:06:13,722 --> 02:06:17,624
"The boy you always quarreled with
is seriously ill. "

1553
02:06:18,627 --> 02:06:20,322
My mind is a blank...

1554
02:06:21,430 --> 02:06:25,332
...and I'll smash your face
for you, yarblockos.

1555
02:06:25,601 --> 02:06:26,590
Good.

1556
02:06:29,204 --> 02:06:31,297
"What do you want? "

1557
02:06:32,408 --> 02:06:35,741
No time for the old in-out, love.
I've just come to read the meter.

1558
02:06:36,145 --> 02:06:37,510
Good.

1559
02:06:41,016 --> 02:06:44,508
"You sold me a crummy watch.
I want my money back. "

1560
02:06:44,953 --> 02:06:48,218
You know what you can do with
that watch? Stick it up your ass!

1561
02:06:48,418 --> 02:06:49,418
Good.

1562
02:06:52,561 --> 02:06:55,257
"You can do whatever
you like with these. "

1563
02:06:56,865 --> 02:06:58,662
Eggiwegs.

1564
02:06:59,168 --> 02:07:01,136
I would like...

1565
02:07:01,370 --> 02:07:02,667
...to smash them.

1566
02:07:03,472 --> 02:07:04,769
And pick them all up...

1567
02:07:04,973 --> 02:07:06,668
...and throw--

1568
02:07:06,875 --> 02:07:08,342
Fucking hell!

1569
02:07:09,178 --> 02:07:11,544
There. That's all there is to it.

1570
02:07:12,181 --> 02:07:13,671
Are you all right?

1571
02:07:14,583 --> 02:07:15,982
Hope so.

1572
02:07:16,151 --> 02:07:19,177
-Is that the end, then?
-Yes.
-I was quite enjoying that.

1573
02:07:19,488 --> 02:07:20,785
Good. I'm glad.

1574
02:07:21,090 --> 02:07:22,182
How many did I get right?

1575
02:07:22,491 --> 02:07:24,254
It's not that kind of a test.

1576
02:07:24,493 --> 02:07:27,792
But you seem well on the way
to making a complete recovery.

1577
02:07:28,497 --> 02:07:29,862
When do I get out, then?

1578
02:07:30,099 --> 02:07:32,761
I'm sure it won't be long now.

1579
02:07:34,103 --> 02:07:35,695
So I waited...

1580
02:07:36,004 --> 02:07:37,471
...and, O my brothers...

1581
02:07:37,906 --> 02:07:39,271
...I got a lot better...

1582
02:07:39,508 --> 02:07:42,773
...munching away at eggiwegs
and lomticks of toast...

1583
02:07:43,011 --> 02:07:45,479
...and lovely steakie-wakes.

1584
02:07:45,681 --> 02:07:47,171
And then one day...

1585
02:07:47,416 --> 02:07:51,512
... they said I was going to have
a very special visitor.

1586
02:07:56,992 --> 02:07:59,688
-Just wait outside for a moment, would you, Officer?
-Yes, sir.

1587
02:08:02,798 --> 02:08:04,925
I'm afraid my change of schedule has thrown you.

1588
02:08:05,234 --> 02:08:07,429
The patient's in the middle of supper.

1589
02:08:07,703 --> 02:08:10,536
That's quite all right, Minister.
No trouble at all.

1590
02:08:12,007 --> 02:08:14,999
-Good evening, my boy.
-Hi there, my little droogies.

1591
02:08:15,244 --> 02:08:17,041
How are you getting on, young man?

1592
02:08:17,413 --> 02:08:19,643
Great, sir. Just great.

1593
02:08:20,416 --> 02:08:22,008
Can I do anything more for you?

1594
02:08:22,217 --> 02:08:24,014
I don't think so, Sir Leslie.
Thank you very much.

1595
02:08:24,219 --> 02:08:26,847
Then I leave you to it.
Nurse!

1596
02:08:29,725 --> 02:08:32,956
You seem to have a whole ward
to yourself, my boy.

1597
02:08:33,262 --> 02:08:34,456
Yes, sir.

1598
02:08:35,063 --> 02:08:37,429
And a very lonely place
it is too, sir...

1599
02:08:37,666 --> 02:08:40,032
...when I wake up in the mid of night
with me pain.

1600
02:08:41,470 --> 02:08:43,734
Yes. Well, anyway, good to see you
on the mend.

1601
02:08:43,972 --> 02:08:46,566
I kept in touch with the hospital, of course.

1602
02:08:46,875 --> 02:08:48,672
And now I've come down
personally...

1603
02:08:48,877 --> 02:08:50,469
...to see how you're getting along.

1604
02:08:50,946 --> 02:08:53,244
I've suffered the tortures
of the damned.

1605
02:08:53,449 --> 02:08:54,939
Tortures of the damned.

1606
02:08:55,250 --> 02:08:58,276
Yes, I can appreciate that
you've had an extremely--

1607
02:08:58,487 --> 02:09:01,285
Oh, look. Let me help you
with that, shall I?

1608
02:09:01,656 --> 02:09:02,647
Thank you, sir. Thank you!

1609
02:09:03,492 --> 02:09:07,690
I can tell you with all sincerity that I
and the government of which I'm a member...

1610
02:09:07,963 --> 02:09:11,899
...are deeply sorry about this,
my boy. Deeply sorry.

1611
02:09:12,100 --> 02:09:13,397
We tried to help you.

1612
02:09:13,602 --> 02:09:17,698
We followed recommendations which were made
to us that turned out to be wrong.

1613
02:09:18,106 --> 02:09:21,974
An inquiry will place the
responsibility where it belongs.

1614
02:09:22,611 --> 02:09:25,876
We want you to regard us as friends.

1615
02:09:26,114 --> 02:09:27,376
We put you right.

1616
02:09:27,783 --> 02:09:29,717
You're getting
the best of treatment.

1617
02:09:29,918 --> 02:09:32,113
We never wished you harm.

1618
02:09:32,421 --> 02:09:35,117
But there are some who did, and do.

1619
02:09:35,624 --> 02:09:38,286
And I think you know who those are.

1620
02:09:38,894 --> 02:09:42,625
There are certain people who wanted
to use you for political ends.

1621
02:09:42,931 --> 02:09:45,297
They would have been
glad to have you dead...

1622
02:09:45,501 --> 02:09:48,629
...for they thought they could then
blame it all on the government.

1623
02:09:49,304 --> 02:09:51,636
There is also a certain man...

1624
02:09:51,840 --> 02:09:54,331
...a writer of subversive
literature...

1625
02:09:54,643 --> 02:09:56,736
...who has been howling
for your blood.

1626
02:09:56,945 --> 02:10:00,346
He's been mad with desire
to stick a knife into you.

1627
02:10:00,816 --> 02:10:02,306
But you're safe from him now.

1628
02:10:02,551 --> 02:10:04,610
We put him away.

1629
02:10:06,522 --> 02:10:09,616
He found out that you
had done wrong to him.

1630
02:10:10,158 --> 02:10:12,558
At least he believed
you had done wrong.

1631
02:10:12,861 --> 02:10:17,059
He formed this idea in his head
that you had been responsible...

1632
02:10:17,366 --> 02:10:20,767
...for the death of someone
near and dear to him.

1633
02:10:21,637 --> 02:10:22,763
He was a menace.

1634
02:10:22,971 --> 02:10:25,064
We put him away
for his own protection.

1635
02:10:25,274 --> 02:10:26,673
And also for yours.

1636
02:10:27,442 --> 02:10:28,773
Where is he now, sir?

1637
02:10:29,077 --> 02:10:32,535
We put him away
where he can do you no harm.

1638
02:10:32,781 --> 02:10:35,841
You see, we are looking
after your interests.

1639
02:10:36,151 --> 02:10:38,176
We are interested in you.

1640
02:10:38,954 --> 02:10:41,980
When you leave here, you'll have no
worries. We'll see to everything.

1641
02:10:42,257 --> 02:10:44,384
A good job on a good salary.

1642
02:10:44,593 --> 02:10:46,356
What job and how much?

1643
02:10:47,195 --> 02:10:51,188
You'll have an interesting job at
a salary which you would regard as adequate.

1644
02:10:51,400 --> 02:10:53,595
Not only for the job
you're going to do...

1645
02:10:53,902 --> 02:10:57,497
...and in compensation for what
you believe you have suffered...

1646
02:10:57,773 --> 02:11:01,402
... but also because
you are helping us.

1647
02:11:02,611 --> 02:11:04,203
Helping you, sir?

1648
02:11:04,479 --> 02:11:07,607
We always help our friends,
don't we?

1649
02:11:14,122 --> 02:11:16,386
It is no secret
that this government...

1650
02:11:16,625 --> 02:11:19,788
... has lost a lot of popularity
because of you, my boy.

1651
02:11:20,028 --> 02:11:23,429
There are some who think that at
the next election we shall be out.

1652
02:11:23,632 --> 02:11:26,430
The press has chosen to take
a very unfavorable view...

1653
02:11:26,635 --> 02:11:28,034
...of what we tried to do.

1654
02:11:29,004 --> 02:11:32,303
But public opinion
has a way of changing.

1655
02:11:32,541 --> 02:11:34,236
And you, Alex...

1656
02:11:34,509 --> 02:11:36,340
...if I may call you Alex ...

1657
02:11:36,612 --> 02:11:39,911
Certainly, sir.
What do they call you at home?

1658
02:11:41,249 --> 02:11:42,511
My name is Frederick.

1659
02:11:43,452 --> 02:11:45,317
As I was saying, Alex...

1660
02:11:45,554 --> 02:11:50,457
...you can be instrumental
in changing the public's verdict.

1661
02:11:53,762 --> 02:11:55,821
Do you understand, Alex?

1662
02:11:56,665 --> 02:11:58,963
Do I make myself clear?

1663
02:12:01,870 --> 02:12:04,168
As an unmuddied lake, Fred.

1664
02:12:04,673 --> 02:12:08,074
As clear as an azure sky
of deepest summer.

1665
02:12:08,343 --> 02:12:09,776
You can rely on me, Fred.

1666
02:12:09,978 --> 02:12:11,343
Good.

1667
02:12:11,580 --> 02:12:13,047
Good boy.

1668
02:12:14,082 --> 02:12:15,947
I understand you're fond of music.

1669
02:12:16,184 --> 02:12:18,379
I have arranged a little
surprise for you.

1670
02:12:18,687 --> 02:12:20,086
Surprise?

1671
02:12:20,355 --> 02:12:22,050
One that I hope that you will like...

1672
02:12:22,290 --> 02:12:23,689
...as a...

1673
02:12:24,493 --> 02:12:25,892
... how shall we put it...

1674
02:12:26,094 --> 02:12:29,359
...as a symbol of
our new understanding.

1675
02:12:30,365 --> 02:12:33,664
An understanding between two friends.

1676
02:13:53,682 --> 02:13:56,344
I was cured, all right!

1677
02:13:56,740 --> 02:14:16,740
