1
00:01:15,335 --> 00:01:17,235
It's due tomorrow.

2
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,869
- What's due tomorrow?
- My paper.

3
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:25,478
What My Dad Does for a Living.
It's due tomorrow.

4
00:01:25,478 --> 00:01:26,873
Oh, yeah.

5
00:01:33,686 --> 00:01:37,918
I own a company
that owns a lot of other companies.

6
00:01:37,918 --> 00:01:41,219
- What kind of companies?
- Retail mostly.

7
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:47,162
Clothes, shoes, pharmaceuticals,
some high-tech stuff.

8
00:01:47,162 --> 00:01:49,824
Okay, but what do you actually do?

9
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,095
I make money.

10
00:01:51,371 --> 00:01:54,306
And it's difficult to explain
to someone your age.

11
00:02:38,017 --> 00:02:40,315
Despite everything...

12
00:02:41,788 --> 00:02:43,847
...I love you, Daddy.

13
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:00,865
Up and at them.

14
00:03:00,865 --> 00:03:02,940
Hey, Jimmy.

15
00:03:03,376 --> 00:03:04,934
You're on your way, Dougie.

16
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,806
Good luck.

17
00:03:09,616 --> 00:03:10,674
Steve.

18
00:03:10,674 --> 00:03:12,340
All right.

19
00:03:12,752 --> 00:03:14,014
My man.

20
00:03:14,014 --> 00:03:15,313
- Thanks.
- Right, man.

21
00:03:15,313 --> 00:03:17,615
- Good luck.
- Get up, get up. It's Dougie's day.

22
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:21,658
He's getting out. Let's go. Get up.
Hey, Dougie's going. Come on, get up.

23
00:03:21,658 --> 00:03:23,352
Let's go, guys. One, two, three.

24
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,997
Let's go.

25
00:03:39,412 --> 00:03:41,642
I don't know why, guys,
but I am going to miss you.

26
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,550
For about five minutes.

27
00:03:52,258 --> 00:03:54,192
Dougie.

28
00:04:03,002 --> 00:04:04,594
Later, Dad.

29
00:04:38,504 --> 00:04:41,098
Well, you won't be seeing much more
of me anytime soon.

30
00:04:41,374 --> 00:04:43,569
- Are you sure?
- That's my girl, man.

31
00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:46,109
That karma will come back to you.

32
00:04:46,109 --> 00:04:47,644
- Baby.
- Baby.

33
00:04:47,644 --> 00:04:49,145
- Baby.
- Thank you.

34
00:04:49,145 --> 00:04:50,441
Hi.

35
00:04:54,954 --> 00:04:56,581
I missed you.

36
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:01,724
Baby, before we wear the paint
off the hood of the car...

37
00:05:02,028 --> 00:05:04,496
...let's take this somewhere
with a mattress.

38
00:05:13,806 --> 00:05:15,398
Oh, baby, this came for you today.

39
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:19,769
Registered mail. Looked important.

40
00:05:30,923 --> 00:05:32,891
Baby, what's the matter?

41
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,851
- Hey....
- My father's dead.

42
00:05:37,363 --> 00:05:39,888
I thought you were an orphan.

43
00:05:42,235 --> 00:05:44,601
Even orphans have fathers somewhere.

44
00:05:44,601 --> 00:05:47,365
No, Ma,
I don't care what your landlady said.

45
00:05:47,365 --> 00:05:49,269
What did the....? Ma, what did the....?

46
00:05:49,269 --> 00:05:52,138
Ma, what did the doctor say?

47
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,048
Any chance I could talk you
out of a smoke?

48
00:05:56,048 --> 00:05:57,842
No chance in hell. Walk away.

49
00:05:57,842 --> 00:06:00,451
Look, I am sorry. I am sorry, Mommy.
I am sorry.

50
00:06:00,787 --> 00:06:03,187
You're telling me
that you're going back to a guy...

51
00:06:03,187 --> 00:06:07,019
...who's idea of romance
is two-for-one night at the dog track?

52
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:08,922
I am right here, okay?

53
00:06:08,922 --> 00:06:12,189
And I treat you like a goddess.

54
00:06:12,665 --> 00:06:14,656
What do you mean,
"maybe that's my problem"?

55
00:06:14,656 --> 00:06:18,497
Hey, I can be a bad boy too
if that's what gets you off.

56
00:06:18,497 --> 00:06:20,696
Hold on, I am getting another call.

57
00:06:21,107 --> 00:06:22,734
No, no, sweetheart, no, no, no.

58
00:06:22,734 --> 00:06:24,968
I am just.... I am being a bad boy, okay?

59
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,543
It was like the role play....

60
00:06:26,543 --> 00:06:29,238
Just hold on, I am sorry. Hold on.

61
00:06:29,238 --> 00:06:31,645
Make it quick, okay?

62
00:06:33,553 --> 00:06:35,748
What do you mean Rodriguez is gone?

63
00:06:35,748 --> 00:06:38,049
Do you mean "gone" gone?

64
00:06:38,049 --> 00:06:40,692
Because if that's the "gone"
you're talking about...

65
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:44,591
...I would appreciate it if you drove
down here and shot me in the face.

66
00:06:44,591 --> 00:06:47,892
Because it would be very comforting
for me to be dead right now.

67
00:06:47,892 --> 00:06:49,796
- Mikey.
- Hey, Leo, special delivery.

68
00:06:49,796 --> 00:06:51,368
Thanks. Look...

69
00:06:51,368 --> 00:06:54,665
...Rodriguez is the biggest bail
that I have ever laid out...

70
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:58,607
...in my entire life-sucking,
miserable career and....

71
00:07:00,213 --> 00:07:02,078
Hold on a second.

72
00:07:05,418 --> 00:07:07,852
You know what? It's only money.

73
00:07:38,684 --> 00:07:39,981
Come on, buddy, what....?

74
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,912
Son of a....

75
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,558
Jimmy, it's a hit. Get on the floor.

76
00:08:10,082 --> 00:08:13,279
All right, come on. Let's go.
All right, all right. All right.

77
00:08:15,888 --> 00:08:18,254
- Get inside.
- Let's go.

78
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:26,257
Nicely done, boys. Let's giddyup.

79
00:08:44,617 --> 00:08:48,144
My God, man.
But you did hit that son of a bitch sweet.

80
00:08:48,754 --> 00:08:50,984
But did you have to jack him up
on national TV?

81
00:08:52,425 --> 00:08:53,949
- I was frustrated.
- Frustrated?

82
00:08:53,949 --> 00:08:56,390
You look like the poster boy
for bipolar disorder.

83
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:59,258
This guy rapes a 10-year-old
and gets off.

84
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,164
I got a 10-year-old.

85
00:09:05,238 --> 00:09:09,675
How I wish you'd have killed him. It would
take the sting out of losing my best cop.

86
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,611
I need your gun, et cetera.

87
00:09:13,611 --> 00:09:18,910
I will try to clean this up
and get you back on the job ASAP.

88
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:21,246
- Sorry, cap.
- Sam, your sister called.

89
00:09:21,246 --> 00:09:23,547
She wanted you to call right back.

90
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,990
They expect him to do a lot of reading?

91
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:32,096
Leo, the undertaker thought
it made him look more natural.

92
00:09:39,605 --> 00:09:41,038
I can't read it when it's hot.

93
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,532
By the pool on Vegas,
I don't know how they do it.

94
00:09:47,947 --> 00:09:50,677
We're talking Baghdad hot
where you're going, old man.

95
00:09:51,918 --> 00:09:55,718
- It's a dry heat.
- Will you please show some respect.

96
00:09:56,088 --> 00:09:58,852
I need quiet when I read.
He should have plenty of that.

97
00:10:02,194 --> 00:10:05,129
- That was funny, kid.
- It wasn't supposed to be funny.

98
00:10:08,834 --> 00:10:11,064
- What was your name again?
- Douglas.

99
00:10:11,064 --> 00:10:12,727
Listen to me, all of you.

100
00:10:12,727 --> 00:10:17,774
The man that lays here before us
was a very different man in his final days.

101
00:10:17,774 --> 00:10:20,572
He changed a great deal for the good.

102
00:10:20,572 --> 00:10:22,873
Yeah, you can tell by the sellout crowd.

103
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:25,415
Then you're going to have
to take my word for it, Sam.

104
00:10:25,415 --> 00:10:27,985
You will all get your money
but we stand here quietly.

105
00:10:28,321 --> 00:10:30,789
- Okay, okay.
- Pay respect to our father as a family.

106
00:10:30,789 --> 00:10:32,549
Understood?

107
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:33,783
- Yup.
- Yeah.

108
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:48,463
I am sorry. Okay?

109
00:10:48,463 --> 00:10:50,108
I am sorry.

110
00:10:58,618 --> 00:10:59,949
Don't even think about it.

111
00:11:18,738 --> 00:11:21,070
Please.
How much money for you to help me?

112
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,264
Do you understand?

113
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:26,001
Anything you want.

114
00:11:26,512 --> 00:11:30,312
Anything in the world you want
if you help me.

115
00:11:30,312 --> 00:11:32,644
Can you buy me a place in heaven?

116
00:11:38,658 --> 00:11:41,126
Well, we.... Wait, wait.

117
00:11:41,794 --> 00:11:44,957
Your father's will reads pretty standard.

118
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:53,465
After a lot of legal mumbo jumbo,
it all boils down to about $3 million.

119
00:11:54,907 --> 00:11:55,965
A piece.

120
00:11:58,644 --> 00:12:01,010
- What?
- Three million each.

121
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:07,341
Oh, my God, I am free at last.

122
00:12:07,341 --> 00:12:10,717
Thank you, Lord almighty.
I am free at last.

123
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:15,727
Substantial estate. I thought he meant,
like, a two-bedroom condo in Boca.

124
00:12:15,727 --> 00:12:17,726
A family and money at the same time.

125
00:12:17,726 --> 00:12:18,989
What did the old man do?

126
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:23,431
Did he rob a bank or something?
It turns out his fifth wife was well-off.

127
00:12:23,803 --> 00:12:26,567
Was she sucking on a tailpipe
when he proposed to her?

128
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:29,299
Leo, please.
She loved him very much till she died.

129
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:31,409
The old man's prints were all over that.

130
00:12:31,409 --> 00:12:32,771
Oh, good Lord, stop.

131
00:12:32,771 --> 00:12:37,075
Daddy left us his money, that's the bottom
line. But there are some contingencies.

132
00:12:37,075 --> 00:12:40,150
What contingencies? What are you
talking about? Is it in pesos?

133
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:45,256
Why don't I go get a cup of Joe
and you kids...

134
00:12:45,256 --> 00:12:47,688
...sort this out.
Okay.

135
00:12:48,394 --> 00:12:49,520
First of all...

136
00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:52,691
...Daddy left me the executor
of the estate.

137
00:12:52,691 --> 00:12:55,527
That seems to make a lot of sense.
Somebody we all trust.

138
00:12:55,527 --> 00:12:59,068
Yes, because if you give the money
to Leo, he will piss it away.

139
00:12:59,672 --> 00:13:02,505
Look, I know you think
that you're this big, mature man...

140
00:13:02,505 --> 00:13:04,540
...but I run a business, okay?
Stop it.

141
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,075
- Stop.
- I am a business man.

142
00:13:06,075 --> 00:13:07,872
There's more.

143
00:13:08,447 --> 00:13:11,143
- Okay.
- You will get the money...

144
00:13:11,143 --> 00:13:16,016
...if you work together in a family 
business for two years.

145
00:13:16,455 --> 00:13:18,218
That's easy.

146
00:13:28,567 --> 00:13:29,966
Well.

147
00:13:31,036 --> 00:13:32,469
- Douglas, right?
- Yeah.

148
00:13:32,772 --> 00:13:35,798
- Nice knowing you, kid. Have a good life.
- Sam. Oh, Sam.

149
00:13:35,798 --> 00:13:37,067
- Nina.
- Sam.

150
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:40,406
I love you very much, Nina,
but this is not funny.

151
00:13:40,913 --> 00:13:43,473
Hey, let's open a deli.

152
00:13:46,786 --> 00:13:50,847
It was his dying wish
to bring us back together as a family.

153
00:13:50,847 --> 00:13:52,547
His dying wish.

154
00:13:52,547 --> 00:13:55,023
Doesn't that mean anything to you,
Sam?

155
00:13:55,023 --> 00:13:57,822
What are we going to do together
without killing each other?

156
00:13:57,822 --> 00:13:59,794
- You know your problem?
- I got ideas.

157
00:13:59,794 --> 00:14:04,163
You're not a glass-half-empty kind of guy.
You're a shove-the-glass-up-your-ass guy.

158
00:14:04,163 --> 00:14:07,828
You figured that this wasn't working
before you even walked in that door.

159
00:14:07,828 --> 00:14:10,532
I love family. We haven't
seen each other in 10 years.

160
00:14:10,532 --> 00:14:13,337
- We hate each other like it was yesterday.
- Sam, stop it.

161
00:14:13,337 --> 00:14:18,176
That reminds me. Just because junior
here is supposedly the old man's seed...

162
00:14:18,176 --> 00:14:20,375
...doesn't mean he's earned a fair share.

163
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:23,613
- He never met the bastard.
- He's Daddy's son, your half brother...

164
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,654
...and I have the documents to prove it.

165
00:14:25,654 --> 00:14:27,952
Okay?
You all need this money desperately.

166
00:14:27,952 --> 00:14:30,823
You have alimony,
you have college tuitions up the road...

167
00:14:30,823 --> 00:14:34,659
...you are suspended without pay.
And you, you're a bail bondsman, really?

168
00:14:34,659 --> 00:14:37,860
What?
I provide a service to the community.

169
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,801
Yeah, in hock up to your eyeballs.
And you, a thief.

170
00:14:40,801 --> 00:14:42,668
I am a good thief.

171
00:14:42,668 --> 00:14:45,538
Like Brad Pitt in Ocean's Eleven.
Maybe you have seen it.

172
00:14:45,538 --> 00:14:47,645
I will be sure to rent the DVD. Thank you.

173
00:14:47,645 --> 00:14:50,304
Now I am not saying
you don't have good reason.

174
00:14:50,304 --> 00:14:53,645
But this is a blessing, a second chance
to become a family again.

175
00:14:53,645 --> 00:14:59,086
That was his dying wish
and you will honor it even if it kills you.

176
00:15:00,226 --> 00:15:02,524
We interrupt this broadcast
for a special report.

177
00:15:02,524 --> 00:15:05,528
Billionaire businessman, Kyle Wills,
was kidnapped today...

178
00:15:05,528 --> 00:15:07,165
.....while en route to his office.

179
00:15:07,165 --> 00:15:09,392
Eyewitness reports from shocked onlookers....

180
00:15:09,392 --> 00:15:13,800
...described a chaotic scene in which
as many as five armed and masked men....

181
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,942
So, what was it like
growing up together, guys?

182
00:15:18,444 --> 00:15:22,505
Come on, I grew up in child facilities
and foster homes but had a good time.

183
00:15:24,783 --> 00:15:26,512
- You want to know what it's like?
- Yeah.

184
00:15:26,512 --> 00:15:29,051
All right, I will give you a little taste.

185
00:15:29,051 --> 00:15:32,213
You ever played the game
"Got you last"?

186
00:15:32,213 --> 00:15:34,791
- No.
- Oh, it's great, man.

187
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,757
All right, what you do is...

188
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:39,690
...you hit each other back and forth,
boom, boom, boom...

189
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,390
...till one guy gets the other guy
really good.

190
00:15:43,836 --> 00:15:46,430
And then you run away
and you say, "Got you last."

191
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:49,870
All right? Then the other guy
chases after you and try to get you back.

192
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,476
It starts all over again. Good times.
A lot of fun.

193
00:15:52,778 --> 00:15:55,042
Except for when you play it with Sam.

194
00:15:57,349 --> 00:15:59,249
Because you know what Sam would do?

195
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:02,182
I would finally get him once,
real good.

196
00:16:02,182 --> 00:16:04,185
And I'd run off.

197
00:16:04,857 --> 00:16:06,722
But he wouldn't chase after me.

198
00:16:07,593 --> 00:16:09,561
And then I would live in fear...

199
00:16:09,561 --> 00:16:11,753
...for hours, sometimes even days...

200
00:16:11,753 --> 00:16:15,389
...wondering when Big Bad Sam
was going to attack me.

201
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:18,400
And you know what your brother
from another mother would do?

202
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,572
He would set his alarm...

203
00:16:23,776 --> 00:16:25,676
...for 3 a.m...

204
00:16:25,676 --> 00:16:27,368
...and walk into my room...

205
00:16:27,368 --> 00:16:30,674
...when I was still sleeping
and slap the shit out of me.

206
00:16:31,016 --> 00:16:33,951
And I'd be laying there
looking up at this monster...

207
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:38,385
...and he'd lean down
and he'd say, "Got you last."

208
00:16:39,525 --> 00:16:41,220
That's the funniest game we played.

209
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,521
The rest, I keep between myself
and my therapist.

210
00:16:44,521 --> 00:16:48,030
- Grow up.
- Kiss my ass, Sam.

211
00:16:51,804 --> 00:16:54,329
- Got you last.
- You all right?

212
00:16:54,329 --> 00:16:57,134
....inside the warehouse,
and then proceeded on their way.

213
00:16:57,134 --> 00:16:58,367
A homeless woman...

214
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,568
I am going to kill you.

215
00:16:59,568 --> 00:17:02,578
...identified Edgar Rodriguez
as one of the Wills kidnappers.

216
00:17:03,949 --> 00:17:06,645
According to the FBI,
Rodriguez is an escaped fugitive...

217
00:17:06,645 --> 00:17:08,548
...facing charges for grand theft....

218
00:17:08,548 --> 00:17:10,348
That's my bail skip.

219
00:17:10,348 --> 00:17:13,286
The Wills family is offering
a 5 million-dollar reward...

220
00:17:13,286 --> 00:17:17,395
...for any information directly resulting
in the billionaire's safe return.

221
00:17:30,776 --> 00:17:32,368
Take this.

222
00:17:32,368 --> 00:17:35,945
Ten mils of Valium.
You will think you're at Club Med.

223
00:17:35,945 --> 00:17:37,480
I don't need this.

224
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,244
I am doing you a favor. Now, take it
or I will shove it down your throat.

225
00:17:41,244 --> 00:17:43,411
Okay.

226
00:17:43,411 --> 00:17:47,150
So all of our communications
with the FBI...

227
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,760
...are done through computer.

228
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:53,130
Very high-tech,
you wouldn't understand.

229
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,698
You're only good
at destroying computer companies.

230
00:17:55,698 --> 00:17:58,029
Don't know jack shit
about how to use them.

231
00:17:58,029 --> 00:17:59,830
May I talk with my family, somehow?

232
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:03,566
Will you please shut up?
You think I am some kind of ogre?

233
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:06,776
See the camera? What do you think
I bought that for, numbnuts?

234
00:18:07,146 --> 00:18:10,047
They see you, you see them,
everybody cries, beg for mercy...

235
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,705
...et cetera, et cetera.

236
00:18:11,705 --> 00:18:15,342
Now, the feds are going to want to
make sure that you're alive.

237
00:18:15,342 --> 00:18:18,979
So I have rigged a live feed
of the Dow Jones stock ticker...

238
00:18:18,979 --> 00:18:20,682
...to run across the screen.

239
00:18:21,026 --> 00:18:23,324
That way,
you can read real time stock quotes...

240
00:18:23,324 --> 00:18:26,464
...and see just how far
your company's gone in the toilet...

241
00:18:26,464 --> 00:18:29,533
...because their leader
is about to die a horrible death...

242
00:18:29,533 --> 00:18:31,532
...unless they pay up.

243
00:18:31,532 --> 00:18:33,068
It's cool, huh?

244
00:18:34,873 --> 00:18:36,568
Okay.

245
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:41,735
Leo needs a favor.

246
00:18:43,015 --> 00:18:44,039
Yeah.

247
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,616
I was thinking,
until we figure out what it is...

248
00:18:46,616 --> 00:18:49,618
...that we could do
as a "family business," you know...

249
00:18:49,618 --> 00:18:52,655
...I have got a little situation
I could use a little help with.

250
00:18:52,655 --> 00:18:54,087
How can I help, bro?

251
00:18:55,394 --> 00:18:58,056
"Bro?" What are you, 12 years old?

252
00:18:58,056 --> 00:19:00,323
Next, you're going to be asking me
to high-five.

253
00:19:00,323 --> 00:19:03,297
Leo, do you want help or not?
Beggars can't be choosers.

254
00:19:03,635 --> 00:19:05,398
Right. Sorry.

255
00:19:06,038 --> 00:19:11,567
Turns out, since I won't be getting
at the old man's cut for two years...

256
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,143
...I am in a little bit of a financial bind.

257
00:19:14,413 --> 00:19:18,679
See, I posted this bond
on this guy, Edgar Rodriguez...

258
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:21,979
...for $250,000 and he skipped on me.

259
00:19:22,254 --> 00:19:24,586
If he doesn't show up
for his trial next week...

260
00:19:24,586 --> 00:19:26,519
...I am on the hook for the $250,000.

261
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:28,922
- This is a nightmare.
- I know. Tell me about it.

262
00:19:28,922 --> 00:19:30,561
But the good news is...

263
00:19:30,561 --> 00:19:33,391
...it seems Rodriguez is involved
with that kidnapping...

264
00:19:33,391 --> 00:19:36,591
...that's all over the news,
so we got that going for us.

265
00:19:36,591 --> 00:19:38,793
EcoSummit down 44.

266
00:19:38,793 --> 00:19:40,302
Smith & Yale down four.

267
00:19:40,302 --> 00:19:42,497
Solomon Gold up 16.

268
00:19:42,497 --> 00:19:46,201
Volume's light, 630 million shares.

269
00:19:46,201 --> 00:19:49,176
Susan, Janson, I am okay.

270
00:19:49,176 --> 00:19:51,316
Janson. Janson, I want....

271
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:57,011
He knows we can trace it.
We will never get any more than that.

272
00:19:59,925 --> 00:20:02,485
The old man's probably laughing
his ass off.

273
00:20:02,485 --> 00:20:04,526
You know this was his plan all along.

274
00:20:04,526 --> 00:20:06,027
No, it wasn't, okay?

275
00:20:06,027 --> 00:20:09,167
He knew it would take that long.
Especially with you.

276
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:12,167
Sammy the bullheaded,
you're just like him.

277
00:20:16,575 --> 00:20:18,600
You're the only one on this planet...

278
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,678
...I would let compare me to him.
I want you to know that.

279
00:20:23,048 --> 00:20:25,073
What would you do?

280
00:20:25,073 --> 00:20:28,913
Slap me around like one of your perps,
huh?

281
00:20:28,913 --> 00:20:31,578
Now, wouldn't that bring down
the wrath of God?

282
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:34,682
You should have been a nun.

283
00:20:35,027 --> 00:20:36,221
Yeah.

284
00:20:36,221 --> 00:20:38,386
Cheated on my husband,
ruined my marriage...

285
00:20:38,386 --> 00:20:40,532
...and ex-communicated from the church.

286
00:20:41,633 --> 00:20:43,100
I got two failed marriages.

287
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,930
A kid who barely knows me.
I am damned to hell for sure.

288
00:20:46,471 --> 00:20:48,439
Chips off the old block, huh?

289
00:20:48,439 --> 00:20:49,938
That's bogus, though.

290
00:20:49,938 --> 00:20:53,441
You know, it's time you grew up
and just stopped blaming him.

291
00:20:56,181 --> 00:20:58,308
Now, it's up to us.

292
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:01,549
I love my brothers...

293
00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:05,417
...unconditionally, even you.

294
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:07,222
Even the one I just met.

295
00:21:07,222 --> 00:21:09,690
Really? What's his name?

296
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:11,453
Douglas.

297
00:21:11,453 --> 00:21:15,191
- He seems very sweet.
- For a juvenile delinquent.

298
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:18,234
Well, you're no prince either
and I still love you.

299
00:21:18,234 --> 00:21:20,735
That's kind of how family works.

300
00:21:20,735 --> 00:21:24,467
- You're actually going to help me out?
- FBI's going to throw every agent at this.

301
00:21:24,467 --> 00:21:27,441
Wills is a huge contributor
to the Republican party.

302
00:21:27,441 --> 00:21:29,205
They're going to find Rodriguez.

303
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:32,612
No, but they're not going to be looking
for Rodriguez, not just yet.

304
00:21:32,612 --> 00:21:36,345
They know this guy is not smart enough
to pull off something this big.

305
00:21:36,345 --> 00:21:39,217
He's nothing but a lieutenant
with the cartels in Mexico.

306
00:21:39,217 --> 00:21:42,656
So interfere with FBI investigation
and be killed by the cartels?

307
00:21:42,656 --> 00:21:45,854
Yeah,
but there's a 5 million dollar reward.

308
00:21:45,854 --> 00:21:48,795
But we're not looking for Wills
so there is no 5 million.

309
00:21:48,795 --> 00:21:50,559
So we split your bond.

310
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,068
That's what, 10 percent on 250 grand?

311
00:21:53,068 --> 00:21:57,106
Twenty-five grand split three ways
is 8,333 and change.

312
00:21:57,106 --> 00:21:58,675
No, listen, Einstein.

313
00:21:58,675 --> 00:22:02,439
The deal was we work together, okay?
We split the old man's money.

314
00:22:02,439 --> 00:22:03,808
That bond is mine.

315
00:22:03,808 --> 00:22:06,416
No, no. This counts as part
of our two-year sentence.

316
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:08,553
The deal was,
anything the company makes...

317
00:22:08,553 --> 00:22:11,416
...gets split three ways. That's the deal.

318
00:22:12,991 --> 00:22:14,151
Tell me what you know.

319
00:22:14,526 --> 00:22:18,087
Slow down, turbo.
I see the way things are going here.

320
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:21,630
You're snapping out orders and 
expecting the two of us to just eat shit.

321
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:25,600
No. Nina said that we work together
as a team.

322
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,762
Oh, well, thank you, John Wooden.

323
00:22:27,762 --> 00:22:29,770
I am a cop. That's what I do.

324
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:33,138
Along the way, I will figure out what
contribution you make to the team.

325
00:22:33,138 --> 00:22:35,974
- Until then, I am stumped.
- Please. Please.

326
00:22:36,348 --> 00:22:37,781
Listen.

327
00:22:38,116 --> 00:22:41,449
Rodriguez was running his mouth off
about this girl that he was dating.

328
00:22:41,449 --> 00:22:43,110
This famous stripper in Mexico.

329
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:45,347
Know how many strip clubs
are in Mexico City?

330
00:22:45,347 --> 00:22:47,549
She's famous, right?
That narrows it down.

331
00:22:47,549 --> 00:22:50,388
Angelina. Angelina. That was her name.

332
00:22:50,388 --> 00:22:53,258
It was a singular name, like Madonna.

333
00:22:53,258 --> 00:22:56,833
Sam, just hear me out, okay?
Hear me out.

334
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,629
If Rodriguez is involved...

335
00:22:58,629 --> 00:23:01,295
...he's involved
because of his connections...

336
00:23:01,295 --> 00:23:02,997
...to the cartel in Mexico.

337
00:23:02,997 --> 00:23:07,009
So it's my guess that
that's where they're hiding Wills.

338
00:23:14,353 --> 00:23:16,719
We're going to need money to get started.

339
00:23:18,523 --> 00:23:19,820
So how much do you need?

340
00:23:20,459 --> 00:23:21,926
Fifteen thousand.

341
00:23:21,926 --> 00:23:25,325
That will get us started.
I will call you when we need more.

342
00:23:26,732 --> 00:23:28,825
- Fifteen grand?
- Yeah.

343
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:32,333
Well, you know,
I plan running a tight ship, Sam.

344
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:36,998
I do not want to dip into Daddy's funds
until you have all proven yourself a bit.

345
00:23:37,609 --> 00:23:41,739
So 10,000 will have to do, no more.

346
00:23:43,014 --> 00:23:45,983
You're being a little tight with 
12 million, don't you think?

347
00:23:46,551 --> 00:23:48,041
It's not our money yet.

348
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:51,121
The company needs to prove itself,
it has to be successful.

349
00:23:51,121 --> 00:23:53,280
I think 10,000 is fair.

350
00:23:54,393 --> 00:23:57,692
Okay. You hold the purse strings.
We will see how it goes.

351
00:23:57,692 --> 00:23:59,057
Okay.

352
00:23:59,057 --> 00:24:02,530
Well, you will be careful, won't you?
I mean, you will look after them?

353
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:04,066
They're grown-ups, Nina.

354
00:24:04,066 --> 00:24:07,967
- I will do my job, I am not a babysitter.
- No, I know, but they are your family.

355
00:24:07,967 --> 00:24:10,540
I'd keep pushing the money angle
if I were you, kid.

356
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,767
I will see you in a week.

357
00:24:14,713 --> 00:24:16,476
Yeah.

358
00:24:32,497 --> 00:24:34,055
So, Sam, what's first?

359
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:36,757
We take a little nap
and then we hit the strip clubs.

360
00:24:36,757 --> 00:24:39,699
It's pretty much my normal routine
in every new town.

361
00:24:39,699 --> 00:24:42,032
No. We call every club in town...

362
00:24:42,032 --> 00:24:45,540
...and see if they have a famous
one-name stripper, Angelina.

363
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:49,339
Should take about a lifetime. Moron.

364
00:24:51,351 --> 00:24:55,342
It might not take as long
as you "guys" think.

365
00:25:54,346 --> 00:25:57,110
Edgar is a very dangerous man.

366
00:25:57,516 --> 00:26:01,577
He would easily kill me
if he thought I was a help to you.

367
00:26:02,854 --> 00:26:06,221
I haven't seen him
since he left for America...

368
00:26:06,892 --> 00:26:07,984
...over a month ago.

369
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:11,686
Listen, Angelina. You don't have
to be afraid of him anymore, okay?

370
00:26:11,686 --> 00:26:13,387
Because we can protect you.

371
00:26:13,387 --> 00:26:15,999
No, we can't.
Don't offer anything you can't deliver.

372
00:26:15,999 --> 00:26:19,603
It wouldn't matter. I can't help you.
I am sorry.

373
00:26:37,088 --> 00:26:38,953
Yeah, get him, Little Joe.

374
00:26:39,925 --> 00:26:41,790
No, no, no. Come on.

375
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:44,258
Listen, Angelina,
I wrote down my cell number.

376
00:26:44,258 --> 00:26:48,627
If you ever need anything at all,
don't hesitate to call.

377
00:26:52,037 --> 00:26:53,061
Oh, my God.

378
00:26:53,061 --> 00:26:55,263
That was like a bad Bonanza episode?

379
00:26:55,263 --> 00:26:56,998
What is a Bonanza episode?

380
00:26:56,998 --> 00:26:59,735
Oh, man, it's this great television show
about this guy.

381
00:26:59,735 --> 00:27:02,004
He had three sons,
all from different mothers.

382
00:27:02,004 --> 00:27:04,239
Very, very relatable to our situation.

383
00:27:04,239 --> 00:27:07,715
Sammy and l, we would sit and watch
the reruns when we were younger.

384
00:27:07,715 --> 00:27:11,845
And pretty much the only time when we
weren't beating each other up, right?

385
00:27:11,845 --> 00:27:13,991
- A stupid show.
- No, it was a great show.

386
00:27:13,991 --> 00:27:18,152
It was classic, iconic television.
I can't believe you have never seen Bonanza.

387
00:27:18,152 --> 00:27:20,298
- They didn't have Nick at Nite?
- No.

388
00:27:21,232 --> 00:27:22,995
You would be a perfect
Little Joe, man.

389
00:27:22,995 --> 00:27:24,328
- The youngest.
- Yeah.

390
00:27:24,328 --> 00:27:27,130
- Who would you be? Hoss?
- No, no. You're Hoss.

391
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:29,170
Big pecs, Popeye forearms. Perfect.

392
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,809
Hoss was defined by his stupidity
rather than size.

393
00:27:31,809 --> 00:27:33,444
And a middle child, you be Hoss.

394
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:35,944
- Eat me.
- Thanks for helping me out in there, Sam.

395
00:27:35,944 --> 00:27:37,308
Like a big brother should.

396
00:27:37,782 --> 00:27:40,114
Brothers? I am a cop.
I was stopping a homicide.

397
00:27:40,585 --> 00:27:42,519
Wow, you're a dick.

398
00:27:43,154 --> 00:27:45,145
It's cool. It's cool. I don't care.

399
00:27:46,725 --> 00:27:49,785
Look, the bottom line is,
we have nothing on Rodriguez.

400
00:27:49,785 --> 00:27:53,226
Not necessarily. She gave me
her apartment number, told me to stop by.

401
00:27:53,226 --> 00:27:55,423
She said she was having a party.

402
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:05,975
Don't press too hard for information.
She's scared.

403
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:07,236
Take it nice and easy.

404
00:28:07,236 --> 00:28:09,539
Look, you're sending a boy
to do a man's job.

405
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:11,204
She asked for the kid. Not you.

406
00:28:11,204 --> 00:28:14,580
I know, but it's a party.
So I could go up there and I could mingle....

407
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,618
Whatever. Anything in that apartment...

408
00:28:16,618 --> 00:28:18,847
...anything that gets us closer
to Rodriguez.

409
00:28:18,847 --> 00:28:20,048
Okay.

410
00:28:20,048 --> 00:28:22,989
All right, I will do my best.
Wish me good luck.

411
00:28:22,989 --> 00:28:25,152
Yeah, right. Just go.

412
00:28:26,931 --> 00:28:30,867
She's going to chew him up
and spit him out.

413
00:28:49,554 --> 00:28:51,317
- Hello.
- Hello.

414
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:55,082
- I thought there was a party?
- There is.

415
00:28:55,082 --> 00:28:58,229
- Am I early?
- No.

416
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:00,157
You are the party.

417
00:30:12,403 --> 00:30:13,927
Thank you.

418
00:30:13,927 --> 00:30:15,697
Thank you, Jesus...

419
00:30:15,697 --> 00:30:17,569
...for answering my prayers.

420
00:30:17,569 --> 00:30:19,300
Oh, you make too much of it.

421
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:23,379
I have got a certain gift, for sure,
but, yeah, you know.

422
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:35,953
Edgar.

423
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:38,323
I will kill your young friend...

424
00:30:38,323 --> 00:30:40,760
...and make love one last time
before I kill you.

425
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,126
Edgar, you said tomorrow.

426
00:30:42,126 --> 00:30:43,995
Because I am early, this is okay?

427
00:30:43,995 --> 00:30:45,466
Edgar, please.

428
00:30:45,466 --> 00:30:47,298
Kill me, but not him.

429
00:30:47,298 --> 00:30:49,133
He's an innocent and blessed by God.

430
00:30:58,316 --> 00:30:59,840
Well, there goes Leo's 200 grand.

431
00:31:00,718 --> 00:31:03,016
Yeah, he's going to be disappointed.

432
00:31:18,837 --> 00:31:20,464
What happened?

433
00:31:21,005 --> 00:31:22,996
- What's going on?
- What did you guys get?

434
00:31:22,996 --> 00:31:26,439
Rodriguez's mother lives in a small town
called Vista Del Fuego.

435
00:31:26,439 --> 00:31:28,272
Him and her are pretty close.

436
00:31:28,272 --> 00:31:31,074
He told Angelina he was going to America
for a big score.

437
00:31:31,074 --> 00:31:33,615
Wait. Who told you this?
Was somebody at the party?

438
00:31:33,615 --> 00:31:36,083
It's Angelina. She was pretty nice.

439
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:39,189
Wait, I don't get it.
She was all buttoned up at the strip club.

440
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:41,587
- What made her change her mind?
- She was....

441
00:31:41,587 --> 00:31:43,818
- Vulnerable.
- What's that supposed to mean?

442
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:45,019
- Leo.
- What?

443
00:31:45,019 --> 00:31:46,754
Rodriguez is dead.

444
00:31:46,754 --> 00:31:48,262
What do you mean?

445
00:31:48,262 --> 00:31:50,424
The kid was in the sack
with his girlfriend.

446
00:31:50,424 --> 00:31:52,399
Rodriguez showed up,
I had to shoot him.

447
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:55,767
You were sleeping with the famous strip....
What did you just say?

448
00:31:55,767 --> 00:31:59,432
Did you say you shot Rodriguez?
What about my $200,000?

449
00:31:59,432 --> 00:32:02,375
We're going to go after Wills
for the 5-million-dollar reward.

450
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:05,015
All we need is information
leading to his safe return.

451
00:32:05,015 --> 00:32:07,447
Rodriguez had to know
where they're hiding Wills.

452
00:32:07,447 --> 00:32:09,519
Unfortunately, you shot him.

453
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,780
Pretty fortunate
from where I was standing.

454
00:32:12,123 --> 00:32:14,557
Laying. You were laying, Romeo.

455
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:17,160
Here's his wallet.
See if you can find anything.

456
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,421
We get a lead,
we call the American Embassy...

457
00:32:19,421 --> 00:32:23,033
...we cash in on the $5,000,000,
and we get on with our separate lives.

458
00:32:32,343 --> 00:32:35,107
I have no idea where we are.

459
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:39,246
Headed northeast, this is the only road.
We're going to make it there eventually.

460
00:32:42,353 --> 00:32:44,048
So, what do you think of the kid?

461
00:32:44,522 --> 00:32:46,456
No way he came
from the old man's loins.

462
00:32:46,958 --> 00:32:47,982
Why do you say that?

463
00:32:48,293 --> 00:32:49,760
He's not a big enough asshole.

464
00:32:50,995 --> 00:32:53,190
Are you actually admitting
you're an asshole?

465
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:55,355
- We're both assholes.
- No.

466
00:32:55,355 --> 00:32:57,501
Don't drag me
into your personal nightmare.

467
00:32:57,501 --> 00:32:59,227
I happen to be a very decent guy.

468
00:33:02,073 --> 00:33:06,009
Just because a drunk admits he's a drunk
doesn't make him any more sober.

469
00:33:06,009 --> 00:33:09,112
Just trying to bond with you, Leo.
I heard misery loves company.

470
00:33:09,414 --> 00:33:14,442
It works the same with misery or without.
It just depends on the company, asshole.

471
00:33:23,061 --> 00:33:24,824
Leave all your valuables in the truck.

472
00:33:24,824 --> 00:33:27,829
One vacancy
in this entire pissant town?

473
00:33:27,829 --> 00:33:30,832
Come on, what is this?
A convention destination?

474
00:33:30,832 --> 00:33:34,130
I have slept on bathroom floors
that were bigger than that hotel room.

475
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:36,967
I had a cell in juvie that was,
like, 6-by-6.

476
00:33:36,967 --> 00:33:39,371
You have to double up in a place like that.

477
00:33:39,371 --> 00:33:42,672
It was a slow week, thank God.
I had the whole place to myself.

478
00:33:42,672 --> 00:33:45,975
- I am pretty lucky like that.
- Yeah, a regular horseshoe up your ass.

479
00:33:45,975 --> 00:33:49,210
There's no way I am sleeping in a bed
with either one of you guys.

480
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:51,048
- Fine. Sleep in the truck.
- Come on.

481
00:33:51,048 --> 00:33:54,055
I will take the floor,
you guys take the beds.

482
00:33:54,959 --> 00:33:57,052
Listen to him, man. He's a puppy dog.

483
00:33:57,052 --> 00:34:00,493
He's cute, cuddly, chicks dig him,
and he will sleep on the floor.

484
00:34:04,902 --> 00:34:08,895
Guys, we got to be careful.
We stick out like sore thumbs in this town.

485
00:34:08,895 --> 00:34:12,406
Man, it's beautiful here.
I wish I spoke Spanish.

486
00:34:12,406 --> 00:34:14,636
I want to immerse myself
in the local culture.

487
00:34:19,717 --> 00:34:23,118
How's that for local culture? Dive in.

488
00:34:23,421 --> 00:34:25,150
Puppy dog.

489
00:34:45,543 --> 00:34:47,773
Senora Rodriguez?

490
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:49,737
Habla English?

491
00:34:49,737 --> 00:34:51,381
You speak any English?

492
00:34:52,216 --> 00:34:54,241
- No.
- Senora Rodriguez.

493
00:34:59,223 --> 00:35:02,056
We got a bilingual brother.
That's going to come in handy here.

494
00:35:02,056 --> 00:35:04,194
Now he can get us killed
in two languages.

495
00:35:04,662 --> 00:35:05,788
Excuse me.

496
00:35:22,713 --> 00:35:23,805
No, no, no.

497
00:35:27,785 --> 00:35:28,809
See if that helps.

498
00:35:45,303 --> 00:35:48,170
Ask about the woman in the picture.
She may be in danger.

499
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:50,239
- Mama.
- Hey, kid.

500
00:36:15,366 --> 00:36:16,958
Rodriguez is dead.

501
00:36:16,958 --> 00:36:18,659
They tracked him down here.

502
00:36:18,659 --> 00:36:21,304
You going to sit there
and tell me you had this figured?

503
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,872
Leave them little pieces of cheese
to find us with?

504
00:36:23,872 --> 00:36:25,440
Make it more interesting?

505
00:36:27,712 --> 00:36:33,582
An FBI agent was quoted in the article.
The bureau is claiming no responsibility.

506
00:36:33,582 --> 00:36:34,843
And you believe them?

507
00:36:35,853 --> 00:36:37,514
I worked for them 10 years.

508
00:36:38,256 --> 00:36:41,623
They will consider it a huge failure
if they don't bring Wills back alive.

509
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:44,689
Whoever killed Rodriguez
doesn't give a damn about Wills.

510
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:47,327
Let me worry about it, will you?

511
00:36:47,598 --> 00:36:51,125
Okay. But while you're worrying,
get off my computer.

512
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,497
It took me a month
to put in money transfers...

513
00:36:53,497 --> 00:36:57,232
...and you're going to crash it 
playing cards. All right.

514
00:36:57,232 --> 00:36:59,342
If feds didn't kill Rodriguez, then who?

515
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:03,571
In the world Rodriguez lives in,
I am sure the list is endless.

516
00:37:03,781 --> 00:37:06,477
It doesn't matter, it's not connected.

517
00:37:06,477 --> 00:37:10,382
Yeah. Except now Rodriguez is dead,
we're in the middle of Mexico.

518
00:37:10,382 --> 00:37:13,023
We don't have the Mexican
who brought us to the dance.

519
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:16,752
We don't need him anymore.
It's all preset.

520
00:37:16,752 --> 00:37:20,261
But you know what? Why don't we send
Bertram and Bermutti into town.

521
00:37:20,261 --> 00:37:22,490
See if anyone
has been looking around.

522
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:40,676
Hey.

523
00:37:40,676 --> 00:37:43,285
You speak Spanish, you do the talking.

524
00:37:45,189 --> 00:37:47,521
What, Sam?
You saying you need me all of a sudden?

525
00:37:47,521 --> 00:37:51,753
No. For some reason, you sound smarter
when I don't know what you're saying.

526
00:37:52,863 --> 00:37:54,831
Hey, could you teach me?

527
00:37:55,433 --> 00:37:57,799
- What?
- Spanish.

528
00:37:58,369 --> 00:38:00,269
Yeah, I will loan you the tapes.

529
00:38:01,939 --> 00:38:04,430
I got it. Thanks.

530
00:38:06,944 --> 00:38:09,469
- Hello.
- Can I help you?

531
00:38:10,648 --> 00:38:13,014
Really? You speak English?

532
00:38:13,014 --> 00:38:15,448
Theresa,
we're friends with Edgar Rodriguez.

533
00:38:15,448 --> 00:38:18,418
- He said you may be able to help us.
- He's dead.

534
00:38:19,257 --> 00:38:21,919
Did you know
that about your friend Edgar?

535
00:38:22,793 --> 00:38:23,817
Are you police?

536
00:38:23,817 --> 00:38:27,761
Gee, everybody is just paranoid
about the cops around here, aren't they?

537
00:38:27,761 --> 00:38:31,163
- I guess it crosses all borders, right?
- We're not the police.

538
00:38:31,163 --> 00:38:33,895
You hear anything
about the kidnapping of the American?

539
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:35,095
I can read.

540
00:38:36,107 --> 00:38:37,972
If you're not police, you should leave.

541
00:38:37,972 --> 00:38:41,475
Or my grandfather is going to blow
a hole through this door and ruin it.

542
00:38:41,475 --> 00:38:43,273
Yup, in that case, I lied.

543
00:38:44,782 --> 00:38:46,647
Just heard
Mexicans are friendly people.

544
00:38:46,647 --> 00:38:49,684
I am half Indian. We're not so friendly.

545
00:38:54,692 --> 00:38:57,889
- I haven't seen Edgar in two years.
- Your picture was in his wallet.

546
00:38:57,889 --> 00:39:01,293
I assure you, you won't find
a picture of him in my wallet.

547
00:39:01,293 --> 00:39:03,933
- You can check.
- No, there's no need.

548
00:39:04,735 --> 00:39:07,499
- She's telling the truth.
- Got a crystal ball up your ass?

549
00:39:07,499 --> 00:39:09,970
- How's that fit with the horseshoe?
- I just know.

550
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:12,666
- But I can only do it with women....
- You're not a cop.

551
00:39:12,666 --> 00:39:15,437
No, I am not a cop.
I am his brother and his brother too.

552
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:18,104
- She doesn't need to know.
- How do you know Rodriguez?

553
00:39:18,104 --> 00:39:20,477
- We grew up together.
- We don't know anything...

554
00:39:20,477 --> 00:39:23,051
...about your country,
but we could use some help.

555
00:39:23,051 --> 00:39:26,621
There's a reward for information
leading to the return of the American.

556
00:39:26,621 --> 00:39:29,658
- We will pay an equal share.
- An equal share? Are you crazy?

557
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:32,455
- Ten percent, max.
- I want no part of it.

558
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:36,029
When I found out Edgar died,
I felt nothing.

559
00:39:40,304 --> 00:39:42,795
- lf she is lying, she's damn good.
- She's not lying.

560
00:39:44,308 --> 00:39:46,003
It's time for you to leave.

561
00:39:47,478 --> 00:39:50,675
See, that's great. Back to square one.

562
00:39:51,415 --> 00:39:52,507
Charmed.

563
00:39:52,507 --> 00:39:55,481
Sorry. We're just kind of
out of our place here.

564
00:39:55,481 --> 00:39:58,645
- You're very kind. Thank you.
- Thank you very much. Okay.

565
00:40:00,725 --> 00:40:02,955
Thought they take your badge
when they fire you.

566
00:40:02,955 --> 00:40:06,187
I wasn't fired, I was suspended.
I keep an old badge just in case.

567
00:40:06,187 --> 00:40:07,490
- Hey, kid.
- Yeah?

568
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:11,761
Rule number one in team play:
Never tell anybody anything until we talk.

569
00:40:11,761 --> 00:40:14,166
Okay. Would you have
asked her for help?

570
00:40:14,166 --> 00:40:16,431
- No.
- Oh, but it's completely okay...

571
00:40:16,431 --> 00:40:19,371
...for you to offer a complete stranger
an equal share.

572
00:40:19,371 --> 00:40:22,307
What the hell is that?
You know, there's no I in team, Sam.

573
00:40:22,307 --> 00:40:26,075
Yeah, but there's an I in family,
and I am still the oldest, so shut up.

574
00:40:30,888 --> 00:40:33,288
You want to know what's going on
in a neighborhood...

575
00:40:33,288 --> 00:40:34,685
...go to a local bar.

576
00:40:34,685 --> 00:40:38,590
This is the type of local bar that you go 
to if you want to get shot for no reason.

577
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:41,493
You speak the language, Leo.
They will respect that.

578
00:40:41,493 --> 00:40:45,465
You bet. How do I beg for my life in
Spanish? Just so.... What are you doing?

579
00:40:45,465 --> 00:40:48,070
This is how you beg for your life
in Spanish.

580
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:51,299
- Good God, Leo. You hunting a bear?
- You got a license for that?

581
00:40:51,299 --> 00:40:54,035
I am a bail bondsman,
not a kindergarten teacher.

582
00:40:54,445 --> 00:40:57,380
Packing that little baby cop peashooters
of yours?

583
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,379
- It will do.
- All right.

584
00:40:59,379 --> 00:41:01,040
You got anything you can use?

585
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,278
- I don't care for guns, man.
- You will make a fine-looking corpse.

586
00:41:04,278 --> 00:41:07,322
Tell you what, just stay here
and keep the engine running.

587
00:41:07,322 --> 00:41:08,856
Yeah.

588
00:41:10,928 --> 00:41:12,418
Be careful.

589
00:41:34,552 --> 00:41:37,248
Yeah, it's a grande mamon.

590
00:41:38,989 --> 00:41:40,547
What was that about?

591
00:41:40,891 --> 00:41:43,758
You know, see what me
speaking the language does?

592
00:41:44,028 --> 00:41:46,690
It turns the whole table around,
puts me in control.

593
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:48,957
And I can see how much you hate it.

594
00:41:48,957 --> 00:41:51,795
It's not a competition.
You will get your head blown off...

595
00:41:51,795 --> 00:41:54,836
...in a place like this.
All right, fair enough.

596
00:41:55,206 --> 00:42:00,166
All right, basically, you want me to 
pretend like you want to buy drugs?

597
00:42:01,378 --> 00:42:03,346
- When in Rome.
- Okay.

598
00:42:03,346 --> 00:42:05,846
See if you can get something
from the bartender.

599
00:42:06,417 --> 00:42:07,475
Hey.

600
00:42:09,453 --> 00:42:10,647
Yeah.

601
00:42:31,375 --> 00:42:32,672
Right.

602
00:42:32,672 --> 00:42:34,435
Well....

603
00:42:40,918 --> 00:42:43,148
Right? You would.

604
00:42:51,562 --> 00:42:52,961
Okay.

605
00:43:08,512 --> 00:43:10,571
- Crap.
- Gentlemen.

606
00:43:10,571 --> 00:43:13,080
Your friend here was double-parked.

607
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,548
- Put your weapons on the bar.
- You heard him.

608
00:43:31,602 --> 00:43:34,127
We think the American, Kyle Wills,
may be hidden here.

609
00:43:34,438 --> 00:43:38,135
You assume I have something to do with it?
No. You have no motive.

610
00:43:38,742 --> 00:43:41,108
Good.
At least you are not a stupid policeman.

611
00:43:43,714 --> 00:43:45,978
- What then?
- lf Rodriguez was to bring him here...

612
00:43:45,978 --> 00:43:48,448
...he'd ask for your permission
out of respect.

613
00:43:48,448 --> 00:43:49,643
Maybe good sense.

614
00:43:49,643 --> 00:43:51,913
Rodriguez had no respect,
very little sense.

615
00:43:52,189 --> 00:43:56,455
He worked for me. He wanted to be me.
Can you blame him?

616
00:43:56,455 --> 00:43:58,959
Will the kidnappers be here
without you knowing it?

617
00:43:58,959 --> 00:44:02,121
If they are here, it's because
Rodriguez knew where to hide them.

618
00:44:02,121 --> 00:44:05,598
- Where I would have no concern.
- Does that place exist?

619
00:44:05,598 --> 00:44:09,261
- Where people aren't afraid of you?
- To know me is to be afraid.

620
00:44:09,261 --> 00:44:12,307
If within a thousand miles in any 
direction, they know me.

621
00:44:12,307 --> 00:44:15,274
- Is there a place of no concern to you?
- Simple.

622
00:44:15,274 --> 00:44:17,971
A places where the soil is not fertile.

623
00:44:17,971 --> 00:44:19,672
I am a farmer, remember?

624
00:44:20,784 --> 00:44:22,479
- What about Indian land?
- Doubtful.

625
00:44:22,853 --> 00:44:24,650
They have their holy places.

626
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:27,290
But there, the Indians
would have killed them by now.

627
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:28,857
Maybe the canyons.

628
00:44:28,857 --> 00:44:32,359
If Wills is here, the U.S. government
is going to bring more heat on you...

629
00:44:32,359 --> 00:44:35,589
...than you can afford.
I want to find him first. I need your help.

630
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:39,258
Even if I had something to do with it,
your government cannot prove it.

631
00:44:39,258 --> 00:44:41,370
You will be dropped off back at your hotel.

632
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:44,701
If you're not gone in 24 hours,
you will die here.

633
00:44:49,613 --> 00:44:51,137
Hey, hey.

634
00:44:58,689 --> 00:45:01,157
- Who were they?
- I don't know, you pig.

635
00:45:05,562 --> 00:45:07,996
You're going to tell me,
you're going to tell me right now.

636
00:45:15,773 --> 00:45:17,570
Father, no.

637
00:45:25,149 --> 00:45:27,515
I am not getting out of this truck
without my hat.

638
00:45:27,515 --> 00:45:29,585
I am not getting out without it.

639
00:45:29,585 --> 00:45:31,880
Hey. Hey. Is that necessary?

640
00:45:35,092 --> 00:45:37,253
I want my hat.

641
00:45:38,829 --> 00:45:40,524
- What do we do now?
- Get out of here.

642
00:45:40,524 --> 00:45:43,792
Are you kidding me?
What about my money, huh?

643
00:45:43,792 --> 00:45:47,835
I go back to work in three weeks.
This is ridiculous.

644
00:45:47,835 --> 00:45:49,233
No. No.

645
00:45:49,233 --> 00:45:51,840
Are you really going to walk away
on this whole thing?

646
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,840
Three million dollars for each of us...

647
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:59,540
...but I don't get my piece without you.
It ain't worth getting killed over.

648
00:46:00,551 --> 00:46:03,918
- It is for me.
- Give it up, Leo.

649
00:46:03,918 --> 00:46:06,056
- I have got nothing left.
- Hey.

650
00:46:06,056 --> 00:46:08,418
Hey. Sam.

651
00:46:10,494 --> 00:46:12,962
Sam, at least think about it
on your way home, man.

652
00:46:12,962 --> 00:46:15,121
Getting a chance to meet my family meant....

653
00:46:15,121 --> 00:46:17,631
We ain't family.

654
00:46:17,631 --> 00:46:21,760
If there's no money involved in this,
we never meet.

655
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,668
What does that tell you?

656
00:46:24,108 --> 00:46:27,874
I don't care about the money.
I am just glad to meet you guys.

657
00:46:27,874 --> 00:46:31,014
I just wish I could have met my dad too,
man.

658
00:46:31,014 --> 00:46:33,172
Let me bring you up to speed
on your family.

659
00:46:33,172 --> 00:46:34,681
Your dad?

660
00:46:34,681 --> 00:46:37,616
An abusive drunk and a sex addict.
Four kids, four mothers.

661
00:46:38,555 --> 00:46:39,988
All right.

662
00:46:40,424 --> 00:46:42,619
Did you at least get a chance
to meet your mom?

663
00:46:42,619 --> 00:46:44,454
Yeah. Stripper.

664
00:46:44,454 --> 00:46:47,893
Raised me for three years,
put me on a doorstep. See you, bye.

665
00:46:48,766 --> 00:46:50,165
All right.

666
00:46:50,667 --> 00:46:51,691
What about Leo's mom?

667
00:46:51,691 --> 00:46:55,600
Cleaning lady for dad's bookie.
Died during childbirth.

668
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,674
Don't worry, him and Nina's mom
had a pretty good run.

669
00:46:58,674 --> 00:47:00,503
Three, four years.

670
00:47:00,503 --> 00:47:02,508
They were drunk the whole time.

671
00:47:10,854 --> 00:47:12,151
Hey.

672
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:22,421
- He must have had good qualities.
- Sure.

673
00:47:22,421 --> 00:47:26,035
He'd only beat up Leo because he
wouldn't hit a girl and was afraid of me.

674
00:47:26,035 --> 00:47:27,693
Wait.

675
00:47:30,774 --> 00:47:32,332
I rigged the door.

676
00:47:32,332 --> 00:47:35,171
Kids were always sneaking
into your rooms in juvie.

677
00:47:36,947 --> 00:47:39,108
Could be somebody still there,
wired the room.

678
00:47:39,108 --> 00:47:42,343
You gave him a key and told the room
because it's not broken into.

679
00:47:42,343 --> 00:47:46,387
Please. Please, a man was here
looking for you, but he's gone.

680
00:47:46,387 --> 00:47:51,017
- Verdugo's men?
- No. No. American. I did not know him.

681
00:48:00,204 --> 00:48:01,694
Open it.

682
00:48:13,917 --> 00:48:14,975
You see?

683
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:16,312
Nothing.

684
00:48:20,257 --> 00:48:21,588
Wait. Get down.

685
00:48:35,472 --> 00:48:39,067
This your idea of an express checkout,
asshole?

686
00:48:39,877 --> 00:48:41,674
It's the same guys
who kidnapped Wills.

687
00:48:41,674 --> 00:48:44,643
They know Rodriguez is dead
and somehow made the connection.

688
00:48:44,643 --> 00:48:46,214
How did they know it was us?

689
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:50,046
Because we're the only morons
with bull's-eyes on our foreheads.

690
00:48:50,046 --> 00:48:51,847
Do you still need help?

691
00:48:54,458 --> 00:48:55,789
What are you doing here?

692
00:48:57,561 --> 00:49:00,894
These men that worked with Edgar,
Americans...

693
00:49:00,894 --> 00:49:04,522
...they came looking for you.
They killed my grandfather.

694
00:49:05,002 --> 00:49:08,096
- Man, oh, man.
- I know every trail, road and canyon...

695
00:49:08,096 --> 00:49:09,899
...for a hundred miles.

696
00:49:23,353 --> 00:49:25,048
We're going to need guns.

697
00:49:34,531 --> 00:49:35,657
Leo, get in the back.

698
00:49:38,969 --> 00:49:41,096
Stop here. We're close.

699
00:49:52,616 --> 00:49:54,982
It used to be a weapons depot
for the military.

700
00:49:54,982 --> 00:49:56,278
Now Verdugo uses it.

701
00:49:56,278 --> 00:49:59,217
- He's going to kill us anyway.
- How are we going to get in there?

702
00:49:59,217 --> 00:50:03,120
They got to have some sort of, like,
security system, or fancy locks....

703
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:07,024
No. Don't worry about it. You take care 
of the guards, I will get you in.

704
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,512
Senor.

705
00:50:47,804 --> 00:50:49,829
Don't know why we don't just shoot
the lock.

706
00:50:49,829 --> 00:50:52,271
It's going to be a lot faster
if I just shoot it off.

707
00:50:52,271 --> 00:50:55,070
Yeah. If the gunshot
doesn't bring the whole town down...

708
00:50:55,070 --> 00:50:57,179
...your big mouth is going to. Shut up.

709
00:50:59,049 --> 00:51:01,074
Hey, guys,
you mind giving me some room?

710
00:51:01,074 --> 00:51:03,742
- Yeah. Oh, sorry. Yeah.
- Yeah.

711
00:51:04,721 --> 00:51:07,485
- Where did you learn that?
- I met a guy when I was a kid.

712
00:51:07,485 --> 00:51:08,885
We called him Uncle Jimmy.

713
00:51:09,459 --> 00:51:11,324
He's the best B & E man in the country.

714
00:51:12,496 --> 00:51:15,659
He taught me
how to get in and out of anything.

715
00:51:31,481 --> 00:51:33,278
Hey, guys, come in.

716
00:51:33,278 --> 00:51:34,712
Oh, my God.

717
00:51:34,712 --> 00:51:38,548
This must be what Charlton Heston's
first wet dream looked like.

718
00:51:38,548 --> 00:51:41,885
This will definitely do.

719
00:51:42,526 --> 00:51:45,154
Someone is going to have to show me
how to use one of these.

720
00:51:45,154 --> 00:51:48,764
You know what, kid?
I have absolutely no idea.

721
00:51:48,764 --> 00:51:51,560
But I bet big bad Sammy the cop
will show you.

722
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,566
No, sir, only the bad guys get these.

723
00:51:53,566 --> 00:51:56,262
Grab a high-powered automatic rifle,
some grenades.

724
00:51:56,262 --> 00:51:58,965
Leo, don't blow yourself up.

725
00:52:08,885 --> 00:52:10,477
How do you feel, boss?

726
00:52:12,823 --> 00:52:14,256
Sorry.

727
00:52:14,858 --> 00:52:15,950
Well.

728
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:19,391
Well, listen to you.

729
00:52:19,629 --> 00:52:22,792
I do believe that apology is sincere.

730
00:52:22,792 --> 00:52:25,457
I mean, there's nothing
like a peek at mortality...

731
00:52:25,457 --> 00:52:27,796
...to sharpen hindsight, huh?

732
00:52:31,241 --> 00:52:33,641
My life has been about money.

733
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:38,206
I have trouble seeing past it.

734
00:52:38,206 --> 00:52:39,643
Don't tell me.

735
00:52:39,643 --> 00:52:44,685
And now you're wondering
if money is what life is all about, huh?

736
00:52:47,891 --> 00:52:50,121
That's cliched, man.

737
00:52:51,361 --> 00:52:52,851
But I am with you.

738
00:52:53,897 --> 00:52:55,797
Because that is the question.

739
00:52:56,433 --> 00:52:58,628
Is the money enough?

740
00:53:01,805 --> 00:53:04,774
I mean, is anything less
than blowing your head off enough?

741
00:53:06,276 --> 00:53:08,972
Because that's the thing
about blowing somebody's head off.

742
00:53:08,972 --> 00:53:11,808
Oh, boy, it is definitely enough.

743
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:21,016
If you're going to kill me,
could I say goodbye to my family first?

744
00:53:21,016 --> 00:53:23,659
What? Tell them you love them,
that sort of nonsense?

745
00:53:26,997 --> 00:53:29,465
Yes. Please.

746
00:53:29,966 --> 00:53:30,990
Wow, that is touching.

747
00:53:32,936 --> 00:53:33,960
Yes.

748
00:53:38,775 --> 00:53:40,003
Relax, will you?

749
00:53:41,144 --> 00:53:43,669
I couldn't even figure out how to load it.

750
00:53:43,669 --> 00:53:46,543
I am not really a gun kind of guy.

751
00:53:56,459 --> 00:53:58,723
Only one road takes us close
to the canyons...

752
00:53:58,723 --> 00:54:02,023
...and they will see us coming for miles.
We will need horses.

753
00:54:02,023 --> 00:54:05,691
Wait.... No, no. Horses?
No, I don't do horses, guys. Okay?

754
00:54:06,203 --> 00:54:07,534
You any good on a horse, kid?

755
00:54:07,534 --> 00:54:10,730
Yeah. I spent a few years
on a work ranch for delinquents.

756
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:12,807
Heigh-ho, Silver.

757
00:54:12,807 --> 00:54:16,275
The Mennonites have the best horses.
Supplies, clothing also.

758
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:17,738
Mennonites?

759
00:54:17,738 --> 00:54:20,178
My ass hurts already.

760
00:54:31,528 --> 00:54:32,552
Over here.

761
00:54:32,552 --> 00:54:34,128
Sir?

762
00:54:36,066 --> 00:54:38,261
I am going to need a real gentle one.

763
00:54:38,261 --> 00:54:39,902
Like....

764
00:54:40,337 --> 00:54:41,861
I'd like to smell the glue.

765
00:54:43,039 --> 00:54:45,439
- Okay.
- The roan is beautiful.

766
00:54:45,439 --> 00:54:47,975
An excellent choice. You know horses.

767
00:54:47,975 --> 00:54:51,443
You got one
where my feet can still touch the ground?

768
00:54:57,687 --> 00:54:59,086
She won't take a saddle.

769
00:55:02,359 --> 00:55:04,919
- Yeah. She's been abused.
- Abused?

770
00:55:05,662 --> 00:55:06,890
No.

771
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:09,054
Some require a firm hand.

772
00:55:12,802 --> 00:55:14,599
Yeah, she's been burnt by the hobbles.

773
00:55:17,974 --> 00:55:19,805
Her ribs are bruised.

774
00:55:19,805 --> 00:55:22,672
Whipped pretty hard on the backside,
and maybe kicked even.

775
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:27,748
- Is that your idea of a firm hand?
- This horse almost killed a man once.

776
00:55:28,218 --> 00:55:29,947
I don't doubt that.

777
00:55:31,655 --> 00:55:32,849
Maybe you can do better.

778
00:55:32,849 --> 00:55:34,217
Yeah.

779
00:55:34,217 --> 00:55:37,292
Well, you don't deserve this horse
or any other. We will take it.

780
00:55:38,628 --> 00:55:40,653
Come here. You stay there.

781
00:55:42,666 --> 00:55:45,499
Yeah. Yeah.

782
00:55:47,704 --> 00:55:48,796
Listen, I got it.

783
00:55:48,796 --> 00:55:51,964
I will let you take care of that, Sam.
Go right ahead.

784
00:55:58,415 --> 00:56:00,007
That's my brother, you know.

785
00:56:02,485 --> 00:56:07,513
- You don't seem like brothers.
- Yeah. Tell me about it.

786
00:56:09,192 --> 00:56:11,683
He's pretty good with that horse, though,
ain't he?

787
00:56:11,683 --> 00:56:14,386
I have seen that kind of training before.

788
00:56:14,386 --> 00:56:16,395
Very gentle.

789
00:56:17,267 --> 00:56:18,325
Thattagirl.

790
00:56:19,102 --> 00:56:20,831
Are you a policeman too?

791
00:56:20,831 --> 00:56:22,130
No.

792
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:23,533
No, no, no.

793
00:56:23,533 --> 00:56:26,642
Not me. Just Sam.

794
00:56:28,311 --> 00:56:30,279
Is he a good one?

795
00:56:31,848 --> 00:56:33,577
I am sure he is.

796
00:56:34,284 --> 00:56:36,650
He's good at everything he does.

797
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:39,417
Except people.

798
00:56:46,963 --> 00:56:49,056
Sorry about your grandfather.

799
00:57:04,547 --> 00:57:06,708
What do you think of Little Joe now,
huh?

800
00:57:13,189 --> 00:57:15,350
The kidnappers got to be talking
to the FBI.

801
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:18,085
There's no phone lines,
no cell phones to trace.

802
00:57:18,085 --> 00:57:21,856
Unless scrambled through a computer.
Wireless phone modems and cell phone.

803
00:57:21,856 --> 00:57:24,522
E-mails.
Hold up. Hold up.

804
00:57:24,522 --> 00:57:27,534
They're going to need a generator.
Generators powered by gas.

805
00:57:28,204 --> 00:57:30,638
Only one gas depot
between here and the canyons.

806
00:57:30,638 --> 00:57:32,968
- Can you find it?
- I am Indian, remember?

807
00:57:32,968 --> 00:57:34,474
Like your cowboy movies.

808
00:57:34,474 --> 00:57:38,273
I get down, put my ear to the ground,
smell the horse dung, sniff the wind.

809
00:57:38,273 --> 00:57:39,972
That's all we're good for, right?

810
00:57:42,218 --> 00:57:45,915
What's wrong with Hiawatha?
Wake up on the wrong side of the bedroll?

811
00:57:46,423 --> 00:57:49,984
Considering what she's been through,
maybe we could cut her some slack, huh?

812
00:57:50,293 --> 00:57:52,318
Come on. Come on.

813
00:57:52,318 --> 00:57:56,932
Yeah, I guess Little Joe is right.
That was kind of stupid.

814
00:57:56,932 --> 00:57:59,466
You know what's stupid?
The whole Bonanza thing.

815
00:57:59,466 --> 00:58:01,035
That's stupid.

816
00:58:03,907 --> 00:58:07,434
You must have cared about him once.
A long time ago.

817
00:58:08,111 --> 00:58:10,272
Edgar was like my father.

818
00:58:10,272 --> 00:58:14,406
He protected me from the things
he knew I would not tolerate.

819
00:58:14,884 --> 00:58:16,010
You mean he lied to you?

820
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:18,253
That's what I mean.

821
00:58:19,088 --> 00:58:22,182
When I found out the true nature
of what he did, I left.

822
00:58:22,182 --> 00:58:23,586
Again, like my father.

823
00:58:23,586 --> 00:58:25,819
What is it that your father did?

824
00:58:26,996 --> 00:58:28,964
Verdugo worked for him.

825
00:58:28,964 --> 00:58:30,565
Hey.

826
00:58:31,201 --> 00:58:34,864
How do you get these things to go
if they don't want to?

827
00:58:35,538 --> 00:58:38,996
The gas depot is over the next rise.
About a mile.

828
00:58:38,996 --> 00:58:41,769
All right, we will rest near here
and we wait for dark.

829
00:58:53,590 --> 00:58:55,649
That is one gorgeous woman, ain't it?

830
00:58:56,292 --> 00:58:58,021
Definitely.

831
00:58:59,762 --> 00:59:03,994
Hey, tell me, little brother,
how do you do it, huh?

832
00:59:03,994 --> 00:59:05,725
With the ladies, I mean.

833
00:59:07,337 --> 00:59:11,296
I am not asking
because I need pointers or anything...

834
00:59:11,296 --> 00:59:14,910
...but good Lord knows
that I do just fine on my own but....

835
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:18,241
I am just asking artist to artist, like....

836
00:59:18,982 --> 00:59:20,313
What's your technique?

837
00:59:20,683 --> 00:59:23,811
Well, Leo, I really don't like to talk
about stuff like that.

838
00:59:23,811 --> 00:59:26,046
It kind of kills the magic.

839
00:59:28,525 --> 00:59:32,086
Wow,
I wasn't meaning locker room B.S.

840
00:59:32,086 --> 00:59:34,321
I was trying to bond, brother to brother.

841
00:59:35,698 --> 00:59:36,892
Apparently, never mind.

842
00:59:40,570 --> 00:59:42,231
All right, well....

843
00:59:42,231 --> 00:59:44,805
- You want to know what the thing is?
- Yeah.

844
00:59:44,805 --> 00:59:47,966
The way I get my joy, my satisfaction...

845
00:59:48,278 --> 00:59:51,577
...is how intense and complete
the woman's joy is.

846
00:59:51,915 --> 00:59:54,543
If the woman seems very giving...

847
00:59:54,543 --> 00:59:59,086
...it's because I am acutely attuned
into her every need.

848
00:59:59,956 --> 01:00:01,548
But in reality...

849
01:00:01,858 --> 01:00:04,088
...it's selfishly motivated.

850
01:00:13,403 --> 01:00:15,200
I guess that could work.

851
01:00:28,184 --> 01:00:31,244
Leo, stay here with Theresa.
Me and the kid are going to look around.

852
01:00:31,244 --> 01:00:34,151
Wait. Why do I have to stay here?

853
01:00:35,058 --> 01:00:36,958
- She will protect you.
- Oh, come on.

854
01:00:36,958 --> 01:00:40,755
I am the one that speaks Spanish.
Not going to talk to them, just look around.

855
01:00:40,755 --> 01:00:43,160
Hey, go, Leo, I could stay with Theresa.

856
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:46,359
- I think we all know where that's going.
- Don't be an idiot, Leo.

857
01:00:46,359 --> 01:00:48,800
Listen to the kid.
Starting to sound like family.

858
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,030
We could all go.

859
01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:53,334
No. I am going to go alone.
Less of a change I can get spotted.

860
01:00:53,334 --> 01:00:55,909
No offense, Sam,
but you're pretty easy to spot.

861
01:00:55,909 --> 01:00:57,478
I don't want you getting shot.

862
01:00:57,478 --> 01:01:01,105
And that neon cowboy hat on your fat head
isn't helping either.

863
01:01:01,105 --> 01:01:03,582
- What, you're worried about me, Leo?
- No.

864
01:01:03,582 --> 01:01:06,449
I just don't want the shot
giving away our position.

865
01:01:56,205 --> 01:01:57,502
Well, if you will excuse me.

866
01:01:57,502 --> 01:02:01,405
I think this might be a good time for me
to freshen up.

867
01:02:01,644 --> 01:02:07,082
Be careful
because human feces is an aphrodisiac...

868
01:02:07,082 --> 01:02:10,242
...for the great brown Mexican grizzly.

869
01:02:11,554 --> 01:02:13,579
Thanks for the tip.

870
01:02:24,167 --> 01:02:26,601
He doesn't have the arrogance
of most men I have known.

871
01:02:28,938 --> 01:02:30,337
Well...

872
01:02:30,807 --> 01:02:32,399
...he can be pretty selfish.

873
01:02:32,399 --> 01:02:34,338
You know, he's just a kid, remember?

874
01:02:38,147 --> 01:02:42,140
Your brother, Sam?
He seems hardened.

875
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:43,342
Yeah.

876
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:45,885
Yeah. It's because he is.

877
01:02:46,756 --> 01:02:49,884
Hard-nosed, hardheaded...

878
01:02:50,493 --> 01:02:51,790
...hard to get along with.

879
01:02:51,790 --> 01:02:54,725
But you, you are none of those things?

880
01:02:54,725 --> 01:02:57,695
Hardened, selfish? Nothing like that?

881
01:02:58,134 --> 01:03:00,193
No. No, it's because I am a giver.

882
01:03:01,137 --> 01:03:03,697
Give, give, give, always give,
never take.

883
01:03:04,407 --> 01:03:05,965
You seem very insecure.

884
01:03:07,710 --> 01:03:10,201
What?
Where did you pick that up, huh?

885
01:03:10,201 --> 01:03:13,212
Some psych class at the local Jaycee
or is that all Dr. Phil?

886
01:03:13,583 --> 01:03:14,948
Who is Dr. Phil?

887
01:03:16,719 --> 01:03:19,711
You need a satellite
to get Dr. Phil out here.

888
01:03:19,956 --> 01:03:24,415
No, no, no. Hey, it's okay.
Look, it's okay, all right? Just relax.

889
01:03:25,795 --> 01:03:27,729
- Your friends, where they at?
- Yeah?

890
01:03:27,729 --> 01:03:29,228
What friends?

891
01:03:31,634 --> 01:03:34,933
The ones riding the other horses.

892
01:03:34,933 --> 01:03:36,662
I am a cowboy.

893
01:03:39,742 --> 01:03:40,834
Those are my horses.

894
01:03:40,834 --> 01:03:43,911
I ride one son of a bitch to death
and then I got a backup.

895
01:03:45,915 --> 01:03:49,112
Tell me or Bernardo
is going to have to cut your girlfriend.

896
01:03:49,619 --> 01:03:52,110
No, no, no. I am taking her to Verdugo.

897
01:03:52,110 --> 01:03:54,279
If you hurt her, he will kill all of us.

898
01:03:54,279 --> 01:03:56,857
Verdugo is the one that sent us.

899
01:03:59,962 --> 01:04:01,429
Last chance.

900
01:04:01,429 --> 01:04:04,293
I mean, if I kill her,
she can't have my kids.

901
01:04:05,868 --> 01:04:06,926
No, no, no, okay.

902
01:04:08,304 --> 01:04:09,498
Okay.

903
01:04:09,498 --> 01:04:11,435
I gave it my best shot.

904
01:04:11,808 --> 01:04:13,799
Wait, I will be honest now, okay?

905
01:04:14,310 --> 01:04:17,711
One of my friends
is right behind your partner.

906
01:04:22,785 --> 01:04:24,446
Theresa, you okay?

907
01:04:24,446 --> 01:04:26,679
Leo. Leo, you all right?

908
01:04:28,090 --> 01:04:30,217
I lost a tooth.

909
01:04:30,217 --> 01:04:31,655
I definitely broke a rib.

910
01:04:31,655 --> 01:04:33,989
And my ass really hurts
from that damn horse.

911
01:04:33,989 --> 01:04:36,529
But you were cool, man.
You were definitely cool.

912
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:37,959
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

913
01:04:37,959 --> 01:04:39,499
- You think so.
- Yeah.

914
01:04:40,002 --> 01:04:42,732
- You were cool too, brother.
- Who the hell are these guys?

915
01:04:42,732 --> 01:04:45,100
You should have seen Leo.
He wouldn't give us up.

916
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:47,208
- No.
- Verdugo sent them.

917
01:04:47,208 --> 01:04:51,540
I bet there's more after them. Listen,
I saw a map, a town called Platzcurro?

918
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:53,181
I got the coordinates.

919
01:04:53,181 --> 01:04:57,183
Patzcurro is half a day's ride
on horseback. Maybe an hour by truck.

920
01:04:57,183 --> 01:04:59,821
Then we go now.
Listen, you keep my horse with you.

921
01:04:59,821 --> 01:05:01,718
If that truck is leaving, I am on it.

922
01:05:01,718 --> 01:05:04,655
What if we run into where they keep
Wills? They will kill him.

923
01:05:04,655 --> 01:05:08,729
The money, only way they get it is if they 
keep him alive. They will kill us first.

924
01:05:08,729 --> 01:05:13,335
- What if they think we're the FBI?
- The FBI won't come in on horseback.

925
01:05:13,335 --> 01:05:17,336
That's a good point. All right,
so we stick to the plan. We find Wills.

926
01:05:17,336 --> 01:05:22,341
We call the American Embassy,
go home, and wait for our check.

927
01:05:23,145 --> 01:05:26,546
Is that all this is about for you?
The money?

928
01:05:26,949 --> 01:05:30,749
I didn't mean it like.... as long as
we're here, the money is not a bad thing.

929
01:05:30,749 --> 01:05:32,080
We should get ready.

930
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:34,780
I didn't mean it like that, Theresa.

931
01:05:35,191 --> 01:05:36,556
Come on. You meant well.

932
01:05:40,897 --> 01:05:42,694
I had a dream last night...

933
01:05:42,694 --> 01:05:45,891
...the guys who killed Rodriguez,
whoever they are...

934
01:05:46,569 --> 01:05:48,594
...were just a myth.

935
01:05:51,741 --> 01:05:53,402
Yeah.

936
01:05:53,402 --> 01:05:58,104
I dreamed you orchestrated the thing,
so we wouldn't have to split the money.

937
01:06:00,549 --> 01:06:02,039
I am not that clever.

938
01:06:03,219 --> 01:06:04,652
Don't underestimate yourself.

939
01:06:49,732 --> 01:06:50,960
Not much.

940
01:06:51,968 --> 01:06:54,266
You understand you habla too much,
I kill you?

941
01:06:56,439 --> 01:06:57,770
Good.

942
01:07:09,452 --> 01:07:12,250
Rise and shine, pumpkin head.

943
01:07:12,755 --> 01:07:14,552
That's what my mother used to say.

944
01:07:14,552 --> 01:07:18,524
If all goes as planned, you should be back
with your pseudo loved ones...

945
01:07:18,524 --> 01:07:20,218
...by happy hour tomorrow night.

946
01:07:20,218 --> 01:07:22,728
At which point,
I will be halfway to handsome.

947
01:07:22,728 --> 01:07:24,991
Before you do
whatever it is you have planned...

948
01:07:24,991 --> 01:07:27,397
...will I be able to talk to my son?

949
01:07:27,737 --> 01:07:29,671
You're sure we're going to kill you, huh?

950
01:07:30,139 --> 01:07:32,630
- Crossed my mind.
- Well, you're wrong...

951
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:37,370
...again. You took 50 million from me,
I take 500 million from you.

952
01:07:37,370 --> 01:07:40,811
Which I would have had if I invested 
the 50 mil in the first place.

953
01:07:40,811 --> 01:07:43,213
Swear to God. It's an eye for an eye.

954
01:07:43,519 --> 01:07:44,850
Biblical, man.

955
01:07:48,024 --> 01:07:51,858
- Move in right now.
- Don't let it go.

956
01:08:02,938 --> 01:08:05,634
- No.
- No, no, no.

957
01:08:07,076 --> 01:08:08,771
To relax.

958
01:08:12,915 --> 01:08:14,314
Hello.

959
01:08:14,314 --> 01:08:20,115
I'd like to speak to the agent in charge
of the Lyle Wills kidnapping investigation.

960
01:08:22,224 --> 01:08:24,920
Yes, I think I can be of help.

961
01:08:26,328 --> 01:08:27,625
Thank you.

962
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:40,968
- You said a few minutes, goddamn it.
- It's only been a few minutes.

963
01:08:41,444 --> 01:08:44,436
What's the matter?
Is the Iceman having a meltdown?

964
01:08:46,715 --> 01:08:51,709
Got it. I got it, baby.
I am all set up for the transfer.

965
01:08:51,709 --> 01:08:54,583
Now, we just got to put our buddy here
online...

966
01:08:57,026 --> 01:08:58,823
...and the party gets started.

967
01:08:59,195 --> 01:09:01,755
Get out of the way.
Move out of the way. Here we go.

968
01:09:05,701 --> 01:09:08,135
I think Sam just pulled up
with the gas truck.

969
01:09:08,504 --> 01:09:10,836
Just look for the guy
with the dorky cowboy hat...

970
01:09:10,836 --> 01:09:14,134
...and with the King Kong shoulders.

971
01:09:14,134 --> 01:09:15,834
- See him.
- Yup.

972
01:09:35,097 --> 01:09:37,827
Strato Entertainment,
down four and an eighth.

973
01:09:38,501 --> 01:09:41,129
CoreCell, down a half.

974
01:09:41,637 --> 01:09:44,003
SoloNET, down two and change.

975
01:09:44,003 --> 01:09:48,405
Can you back the hell off please?
I can't even hear myself think here.

976
01:09:53,415 --> 01:09:54,439
Janson.

977
01:09:54,917 --> 01:09:56,009
Yeah, Dad?

978
01:09:57,219 --> 01:10:01,280
I wanted to tell you what I do 
for a living. For your report.

979
01:10:02,391 --> 01:10:04,222
I turned it in, Dad.

980
01:10:04,222 --> 01:10:05,621
I made some stuff up.

981
01:10:07,563 --> 01:10:08,723
I am sorry.

982
01:10:09,865 --> 01:10:11,799
But I'd still like to know.

983
01:10:12,168 --> 01:10:13,192
Got it.

984
01:10:13,903 --> 01:10:15,302
Here we go.

985
01:10:15,302 --> 01:10:18,031
All we got to do is split it up
and we're out of here.

986
01:10:49,838 --> 01:10:51,203
You're insane, Sam.

987
01:10:51,203 --> 01:10:52,738
My God, what just happened?

988
01:10:52,738 --> 01:10:53,932
What was that?

989
01:10:54,243 --> 01:10:56,473
Get out of the way. Get out there.

990
01:10:56,912 --> 01:10:59,346
We split up.
Make them think that there's more of us.

991
01:10:59,648 --> 01:11:01,912
Where....?
My husband, what happened to him?

992
01:11:02,351 --> 01:11:05,377
Jeez, it's not us.

993
01:11:05,377 --> 01:11:07,579
We're headed there now.

994
01:11:07,579 --> 01:11:10,088
The Black Hawks
the Mexican military promised us...

995
01:11:10,088 --> 01:11:12,750
...are both down
with mechanical problems so....

996
01:11:13,128 --> 01:11:16,188
Commercial helicopters are at least
two hours out from Mexico City.

997
01:11:16,188 --> 01:11:17,992
Copy that.

998
01:11:20,035 --> 01:11:22,469
It all starts with an idea, right?

999
01:11:22,469 --> 01:11:25,198
These people come up with ideas.

1000
01:11:25,708 --> 01:11:28,199
Good people, good ideas.

1001
01:11:28,199 --> 01:11:29,901
That's how you start a business.

1002
01:11:47,863 --> 01:11:49,956
Anybody see anything?

1003
01:11:50,532 --> 01:11:53,660
I can see the future. You're not in it.

1004
01:11:54,069 --> 01:11:55,502
Drop it.

1005
01:11:57,239 --> 01:11:58,263
Where's Wills?

1006
01:11:58,540 --> 01:11:59,564
Dead.

1007
01:12:00,209 --> 01:12:01,233
You're late.

1008
01:12:01,233 --> 01:12:03,537
If he was dead,
you would have moved on by now.

1009
01:12:07,149 --> 01:12:09,014
The one with Sam
killed my grandfather.

1010
01:12:23,098 --> 01:12:24,998
You must be the guy
that killed Rodriguez.

1011
01:12:24,998 --> 01:12:27,465
You picked the wrong horse, bubba.

1012
01:12:38,781 --> 01:12:39,805
Kill them both.

1013
01:13:19,154 --> 01:13:20,519
Got it. Done.

1014
01:13:21,156 --> 01:13:22,885
- That's what my company does.
- Done.

1015
01:13:22,885 --> 01:13:25,720
You make it sound like charity work,
you puke.

1016
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:27,657
- Janson....
- Hey, look, kid.

1017
01:13:27,657 --> 01:13:29,855
Then your old man fires all the people...

1018
01:13:30,132 --> 01:13:33,158
...then brings in teams of lawyers
and private investigators...

1019
01:13:33,158 --> 01:13:34,666
.....to ruin everybody's lives.

1020
01:13:34,666 --> 01:13:37,670
Trust me,
I know from firsthand experience.

1021
01:13:37,670 --> 01:13:41,401
- That's what your old man does.
- We have to go now.

1022
01:13:42,644 --> 01:13:45,010
- Janson, I....
- Do you do that, Dad?

1023
01:13:48,717 --> 01:13:50,742
Yes. Yes.

1024
01:13:53,188 --> 01:13:55,053
That's what I do.

1025
01:14:07,970 --> 01:14:09,403
Go, go, go.

1026
01:14:23,952 --> 01:14:26,546
Theresa and Leo check the grounds.
I go after the Bronco.

1027
01:14:26,546 --> 01:14:28,849
- Through the mountains.
- Bronco doesn't matter.

1028
01:14:28,849 --> 01:14:31,788
It matters to Theresa.
That guy killed her grandfather.

1029
01:14:32,861 --> 01:14:34,260
Just don't get hurt.

1030
01:14:43,005 --> 01:14:44,131
Hey....

1031
01:14:50,579 --> 01:14:52,012
What?

1032
01:15:10,966 --> 01:15:12,456
Verdugo.

1033
01:15:13,101 --> 01:15:14,693
Crap.

1034
01:15:49,972 --> 01:15:51,064
Senor Wills?

1035
01:15:57,479 --> 01:15:59,538
This. This is unacceptable.

1036
01:16:00,249 --> 01:16:01,648
Are you with the FBI?

1037
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:06,350
No, no. I am here to escort you to them.

1038
01:16:08,824 --> 01:16:10,018
You are safe now.

1039
01:16:10,492 --> 01:16:11,652
You are in safe hands.

1040
01:16:23,906 --> 01:16:26,841
All right, before they beat you,
I know you had it in you, okay?

1041
01:16:26,841 --> 01:16:29,068
Now, you show me. Come on. Let's go.

1042
01:18:09,077 --> 01:18:10,567
Hey.

1043
01:18:11,913 --> 01:18:14,609
- Lost a lot of blood there, Little Joe.
- You okay, kid?

1044
01:18:15,283 --> 01:18:17,217
Hey, Sam.

1045
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:19,382
You find Wills?

1046
01:18:23,125 --> 01:18:27,425
Verdugo came and turned him over
to the FBI like a good Samaritan.

1047
01:18:28,697 --> 01:18:30,665
Okay, so, what does that mean for us?

1048
01:18:30,665 --> 01:18:31,890
It means we're broke.

1049
01:18:33,335 --> 01:18:34,563
I got to admit, though.

1050
01:18:34,563 --> 01:18:39,196
Seeing that asshole tits up,
that was worth a million bucks, right?

1051
01:18:41,710 --> 01:18:45,077
Unfortunately, it doesn't bring
my grandfather back, does it?

1052
01:18:54,356 --> 01:18:58,520
I can't.... I just can't catch a break
with this broad, can l?

1053
01:18:59,961 --> 01:19:02,020
Try keeping your mouth shut.

1054
01:19:14,443 --> 01:19:18,675
Hey, hey. Wait. Wait.

1055
01:19:18,675 --> 01:19:20,007
Wait a minute.

1056
01:19:20,649 --> 01:19:23,880
I didn't come all this way
to die of exhaustion, okay?

1057
01:19:24,319 --> 01:19:27,220
Give me five minutes, okay?

1058
01:19:31,326 --> 01:19:36,127
Well, I guess
this is as good a place as any.

1059
01:19:42,404 --> 01:19:43,701
Hey, get out of my stuff.

1060
01:19:44,172 --> 01:19:46,470
- Sit down.
- What? Hey.

1061
01:19:46,470 --> 01:19:49,906
What are you doing? What....?
Oh, come on, guys.

1062
01:19:50,378 --> 01:19:52,869
Put those down. Come on.

1063
01:19:54,382 --> 01:19:55,576
Is this the backup?

1064
01:19:57,419 --> 01:19:59,011
The backup flash drive, this is?

1065
01:19:59,011 --> 01:20:02,122
That's it. That's all we need.
Come on. Let's get going.

1066
01:20:02,122 --> 01:20:04,224
I don't have to.... I don't have to sit.

1067
01:20:05,761 --> 01:20:08,491
Hey, what are you, insane?
What's the matter....?

1068
01:20:08,491 --> 01:20:10,494
- Sit down, you pathetic....
- Wait, wait.

1069
01:20:10,899 --> 01:20:12,457
- Okay.
- You were right.

1070
01:20:12,457 --> 01:20:16,092
- Oh, wait.
- I underestimated myself.

1071
01:20:16,471 --> 01:20:19,099
Oh, come on.

1072
01:20:19,508 --> 01:20:20,907
Why didn't I see this?

1073
01:20:20,907 --> 01:20:22,475
Stop talking.

1074
01:20:24,279 --> 01:20:25,803
Please tell my mother....

1075
01:20:28,250 --> 01:20:29,945
That's them.

1076
01:20:30,819 --> 01:20:34,448
I saw them meet-up at the canyon.
It was just too dark to bring them down.

1077
01:20:35,157 --> 01:20:37,182
Only an Indian
could guide them through.

1078
01:20:38,660 --> 01:20:42,187
They must have some plan of getting
picked up or transported from there.

1079
01:20:42,631 --> 01:20:44,360
Unless we can get him before sunrise.

1080
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:48,025
We have maybe four hours before dawn.
After that, they're gone.

1081
01:20:48,025 --> 01:20:49,227
No, what? What?

1082
01:20:49,227 --> 01:20:51,565
What are you guys talking about?

1083
01:20:52,274 --> 01:20:57,268
No, no, no. The guy that killed
your grandfather is already dead, okay?

1084
01:20:57,268 --> 01:21:01,245
We're.... I am not going to get my money back.
We have no shot at the reward money.

1085
01:21:01,245 --> 01:21:05,284
Wills is back with his family.
Our job is done here.

1086
01:21:06,621 --> 01:21:09,681
Do you see anybody else out here
that's going to go after him, Leo?

1087
01:21:10,058 --> 01:21:12,026
What's that got to do with anything,
Sam?

1088
01:21:12,026 --> 01:21:16,153
- I am a cop. I don't get to walk away.
- You're not a cop. You got suspended.

1089
01:21:16,153 --> 01:21:18,492
I am not asking you to go.
Stay with the kid.

1090
01:21:18,492 --> 01:21:20,862
- Fine.
- I told you I am fine. I can go.

1091
01:21:21,203 --> 01:21:24,138
Oh, that's just great.
Now, you're going to get the kid killed too.

1092
01:21:24,138 --> 01:21:27,241
You know, just when I was starting
to like your dumb ass.

1093
01:21:27,241 --> 01:21:29,969
No, I am not letting you take him
with you.

1094
01:21:29,969 --> 01:21:33,308
His leg, it's about to fall off.
What are you going to do? Carry him?

1095
01:21:33,308 --> 01:21:35,745
- Jeez, Leo, shut up.
- No, I won't shut up.

1096
01:21:35,745 --> 01:21:38,078
It's crazy, Sam.

1097
01:21:40,555 --> 01:21:42,455
- You know what, Sam?
- What?

1098
01:21:42,455 --> 01:21:47,493
It baffles me that you're not capable
of walking away from being a cop...

1099
01:21:47,493 --> 01:21:50,529
...yet you're completely fine
with walking out on me...

1100
01:21:50,529 --> 01:21:52,564
...and your little sister.

1101
01:21:55,770 --> 01:21:59,866
- So that's what this is all about, Leo?
- You left us alone with him.

1102
01:22:00,408 --> 01:22:05,573
You have absolutely no idea
how bad it got when you were gone.

1103
01:22:05,573 --> 01:22:09,774
Now, now, Nina, you know her.
She probably forgave you by now...

1104
01:22:09,774 --> 01:22:11,509
...but me?

1105
01:22:13,788 --> 01:22:18,248
You were the one
that was taking care of us, not him.

1106
01:22:19,728 --> 01:22:22,788
I expected nothing from him, but you?

1107
01:22:26,268 --> 01:22:28,395
You know the funny thing?

1108
01:22:30,071 --> 01:22:32,437
Eventually, he sobered up.

1109
01:22:36,077 --> 01:22:38,637
You never came back, Sam.

1110
01:22:38,947 --> 01:22:42,906
It's crazy how much you resent the guy
because...

1111
01:22:44,319 --> 01:22:46,617
...you're just like him, Sam.

1112
01:22:46,617 --> 01:22:48,415
Hey.

1113
01:22:49,090 --> 01:22:50,114
Come on.

1114
01:22:51,660 --> 01:22:53,594
I got you last.

1115
01:22:53,594 --> 01:22:57,129
What are you going to do, huh? Do it.

1116
01:22:57,129 --> 01:22:59,028
Do it.

1117
01:23:01,036 --> 01:23:02,901
Come on.

1118
01:23:09,778 --> 01:23:11,939
I was 17 years old.

1119
01:23:13,448 --> 01:23:15,507
If I'd have stayed, I'd have killed him.

1120
01:23:17,018 --> 01:23:18,485
Sorry.

1121
01:23:48,850 --> 01:23:50,408
Marcus Canton.

1122
01:23:50,408 --> 01:23:53,110
We're going to have to move faster.

1123
01:23:53,688 --> 01:23:56,919
- How's the leg, kid?
- It's good enough.

1124
01:24:10,406 --> 01:24:14,669
It will be difficult for the horses
the rest of the way in the canyons.

1125
01:24:14,669 --> 01:24:18,301
- You think they're looking for him?
- I don't know. It's not military.

1126
01:24:22,150 --> 01:24:23,310
Maybe that's his way out.

1127
01:24:23,310 --> 01:24:25,180
Head down in case he doubles back.

1128
01:24:25,180 --> 01:24:28,015
They won't be able to land
at the bottom of the canyons.

1129
01:24:28,015 --> 01:24:30,248
- They're going to pull him out.
- Right.

1130
01:25:54,676 --> 01:25:57,736
- You okay?
- I am fine. Go.

1131
01:26:23,138 --> 01:26:24,298
Morning.

1132
01:26:24,739 --> 01:26:27,037
What brings you
to this neck of the woods?

1133
01:26:28,877 --> 01:26:30,105
You're under arrest.

1134
01:26:44,159 --> 01:26:46,992
Never walk out on family, Sam.

1135
01:26:49,297 --> 01:26:51,128
You're absolutely right.

1136
01:26:53,701 --> 01:26:57,637
Nice going. What is it? Horse?

1137
01:26:57,972 --> 01:26:59,530
No, it's Hoss.

1138
01:27:00,108 --> 01:27:04,166
- And I am not Hoss.
- I can't be Hoss, I am the oldest.

1139
01:27:04,812 --> 01:27:06,643
By process of elimination, you're Hoss.

1140
01:27:06,643 --> 01:27:12,548
Fine, if only by process of elimination,
then I can live with that.

1141
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:28,260
- Are you sure there's nothing we can do?
- Yeah, I mean, the FBI...

1142
01:27:28,260 --> 01:27:31,894
...they said that we're good
for at least $250,000 of the reward money.

1143
01:27:31,894 --> 01:27:34,803
And in my opinion,
I think you more than earned your share.

1144
01:27:34,803 --> 01:27:37,206
That's 25 percent.

1145
01:27:37,206 --> 01:27:39,903
I mean, I am assuming
that's okay with you guys.

1146
01:27:39,903 --> 01:27:41,241
- Absolutely.
- Seems fair.

1147
01:27:41,241 --> 01:27:42,713
- Yeah.
- No, please, I am fine.

1148
01:27:43,484 --> 01:27:44,951
Come on.

1149
01:27:46,421 --> 01:27:47,854
All right, come here.

1150
01:27:48,623 --> 01:27:49,954
- Careful.
- Thank you.

1151
01:27:49,954 --> 01:27:52,558
I am sorry,
I know it's been a couple of days.

1152
01:27:52,558 --> 01:27:54,285
All right, take care.

1153
01:27:54,285 --> 01:27:56,726
- Thank you.
- Get her, cowboy.

1154
01:27:56,726 --> 01:27:58,297
Take care.

1155
01:28:00,435 --> 01:28:01,629
I will miss you.

1156
01:28:04,739 --> 01:28:07,139
I'd like to come back to visit
if that's okay.

1157
01:28:07,139 --> 01:28:11,005
Leo is going to lend me his Spanish tapes,
he says.

1158
01:28:11,005 --> 01:28:13,443
I think I'd like that very much.

1159
01:28:14,916 --> 01:28:16,440
Take care.

1160
01:28:17,385 --> 01:28:18,943
Bye.

1161
01:28:34,836 --> 01:28:38,101
Oh, it was amazing. And this guy,
he's probably going back there.

1162
01:28:38,101 --> 01:28:40,707
- Shut up.
- There was a special girl I might go see.

1163
01:28:40,707 --> 01:28:42,809
I can't believe we made it through alive.

1164
01:28:42,809 --> 01:28:45,309
- Without him, I don't think we would have.
- Yeah.

1165
01:28:45,309 --> 01:28:47,675
I wasn't there but you were....
You, walking in...

1166
01:28:47,675 --> 01:28:50,079
...and you noticed the cliff.
Yeah.

1167
01:28:50,079 --> 01:28:52,412
Let's go, let's go.
You're going down there.

1168
01:28:52,412 --> 01:28:54,179
Yeah.

1169
01:28:56,090 --> 01:28:57,489
I wish you could have seen him.

1170
01:28:57,489 --> 01:28:59,923
You got to give me those tapes.

1171
01:29:04,198 --> 01:29:05,859
There is no money.

1172
01:29:11,339 --> 01:29:13,330
There never was.

1173
01:29:13,330 --> 01:29:16,409
It was the only way
to bring you all together.

1174
01:29:19,580 --> 01:29:21,514
Daddy really was a changed man.

1175
01:29:22,383 --> 01:29:25,580
It was his final wish
to bring you all together.

1176
01:29:25,580 --> 01:29:27,277
That much was true.

1177
01:29:31,693 --> 01:29:34,856
There was no other way. I am sorry.

1178
01:29:35,129 --> 01:29:36,824
You lied?

1179
01:29:37,965 --> 01:29:40,331
You never told a lie in your entire life.

1180
01:29:41,169 --> 01:29:44,730
I mean, me, I lie all the time, and Sam...

1181
01:29:45,173 --> 01:29:46,663
...he's a huge liar.

1182
01:29:46,663 --> 01:29:49,810
Then Douglas, the kid's a thief.
But you?

1183
01:29:50,545 --> 01:29:51,807
I believed you, Nina.

1184
01:29:51,807 --> 01:29:54,880
I am sorry. I am so sorry.
I will go to confession.

1185
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:59,213
Oh, yeah. "Okay, I will go to confession.
It's all fine now." Are you kidding me?

1186
01:29:59,213 --> 01:30:02,322
- What are you going to do about us?
- Leo, I am sorry you're angry.

1187
01:30:02,657 --> 01:30:04,591
But the real question is...

1188
01:30:05,693 --> 01:30:08,992
...does the end justify the means?

1189
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:14,259
I mean, look at you all.

1190
01:30:22,176 --> 01:30:25,168
What about
a private investigation agency?

1191
01:30:26,180 --> 01:30:28,114
I don't follow.

1192
01:30:28,483 --> 01:30:32,715
I am a cop. Leo, bail bondsman.
We know criminals.

1193
01:30:32,715 --> 01:30:35,515
- The kid is a criminal.
- No. Absolutely not.

1194
01:30:35,515 --> 01:30:38,284
No, I am not bringing you together
so you can get killed.

1195
01:30:38,284 --> 01:30:40,518
Wait a second.
Are you actually suggesting...

1196
01:30:40,518 --> 01:30:42,959
...that we still go 
into business together anyway?

1197
01:30:42,959 --> 01:30:46,066
If you're going to do something,
you might as well be good at it.

1198
01:30:46,066 --> 01:30:47,258
Yeah, I like it.

1199
01:30:47,258 --> 01:30:48,561
- No.
- I am in.

1200
01:30:48,561 --> 01:30:51,899
- That is not what Daddy wanted.
- The old man wanted us together.

1201
01:30:51,899 --> 01:30:55,600
Hope that sorry son of a bitch
is rolling over in his grave right now.

1202
01:30:56,778 --> 01:30:57,904
We got him last.

1203
01:31:09,157 --> 01:31:12,957
- Marker.
- Molly, Molly, Molly.

1204
01:31:13,795 --> 01:31:15,319
Grow up.

1205
01:31:15,630 --> 01:31:17,928
Kiss my ass, Sam.

1206
01:31:18,166 --> 01:31:20,191
- Kid.
- My bad.

1207
01:31:20,191 --> 01:31:21,733
It's all right.

1208
01:31:21,733 --> 01:31:25,464
For some reason,
he was really scary-looking that time.

1209
01:31:26,274 --> 01:31:28,674
That way,
you can read real-time stock quotes...

1210
01:31:28,674 --> 01:31:31,368
...and see how far
your company's gone in the toilet...

1211
01:31:31,368 --> 01:31:34,447
...because their leader
is about to die a horrible death.

1212
01:31:34,447 --> 01:31:37,448
Sorry, don't have my glasses on.

1213
01:31:38,019 --> 01:31:39,247
Fuck, close your eyes.

1214
01:31:40,855 --> 01:31:44,222
F-bomb. What the fudge and mustard?

1215
01:31:48,729 --> 01:31:51,061
You don't seem like brothers.

1216
01:31:51,265 --> 01:31:53,529
You ever seen Wild at Heart?

1217
01:31:54,302 --> 01:31:58,663
The two Black Hawks promised us
are both down with mechanical problems.

1218
01:32:00,675 --> 01:32:02,108
You got egg on your face.

1219
01:32:02,108 --> 01:32:04,267
- And cut it.
- I always....

1220
01:32:04,267 --> 01:32:09,178
It seems that my Rodriguez guy
is involved with that Kyle Wills....

1221
01:32:09,178 --> 01:32:12,478
- It seems that that.....
- Now you have egg on your face.

1222
01:32:13,454 --> 01:32:15,786
We're going to need some money
to get started.

1223
01:32:18,593 --> 01:32:20,493
How do you look in heels?

1224
01:32:21,496 --> 01:32:23,862
You, me, a faraway getaway place...

1225
01:32:23,862 --> 01:32:27,057
...some deli meats and a gallon of brandy.
That's fine with me.

1226
01:32:29,637 --> 01:32:31,002
Sam.

1227
01:32:31,002 --> 01:32:33,800
Oh, my God,
he can't hold a straight face over here.

1228
01:32:38,679 --> 01:32:41,512
Did wholesome Amy Smart
just say what I think she said?

1229
01:32:41,512 --> 01:32:43,877
Yeah, I did. I said, fuck.

1230
01:32:43,877 --> 01:32:45,712
And cut it.

1231
01:32:47,889 --> 01:32:52,223
Okay, trust me, trust me. I was a....
Trust me. Son of a bitch.

1232
01:32:52,223 --> 01:32:54,520
- Why am I having.....?
- Don't trust him.

1233
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:57,562
Don't trust him. Don't trust him.

1234
01:32:58,199 --> 01:33:00,258

1235
01:33:00,258 --> 01:33:01,799
Do it. That's okay. No, no.

1236
01:33:01,799 --> 01:33:05,405

01:33:24,622 --> 01:33:26,054
Just for the gag reel.

1239
01:33:31,132 --> 01:33:32,360
Come on.

1240
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:35,728
- Spit it out, woman.
- Cut. Great, cut.

1241
01:33:49,383 --> 01:33:53,581
I know every trail, road and canyon
for a hundred miles.

1242
01:33:55,723 --> 01:33:58,055
We're going to need guns.
