3
00:00:44,587 --> 00:00:50,009
The legend of the ten rings
has been told for thousands of years.

4
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:56,433
Every generation,
the story grows.

5
00:00:56,599 --> 00:01:01,396
But at its centre,
there is always one man.

6
00:01:10,113 --> 00:01:14,367
Some say he found the rings in a crater

7
00:01:14,451 --> 00:01:17,120
or stole them from a tomb.

8
00:01:19,706 --> 00:01:22,542
They gave him the strength of a god,

9
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:26,212
and the gift of eternal life.

10
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:36,431
He could have used them for good.

11
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,979
But all he wanted...

12
00:01:43,146 --> 00:01:44,856
was power.

13
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,485
He called his army The Ten Rings.

14
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:34,030
Over the centuries,

15
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:37,826
they spread into
every corner of the world.

16
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:48,002
They moved in the shadows...

17
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:52,382
Toppled governments...

18
00:02:54,926 --> 00:02:58,263
And changed the course of history.

19
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:17,490
He chased money and power
for a thousand years.

20
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:21,452
But he still wanted more.

21
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:29,502
Have you heard the legend of Ta Lo?

22
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:34,841
A hidden village with mythical creatures
and ancient magic.

23
00:03:35,008 --> 00:03:39,971
Where people practise a
martial arts style from the gods.

24
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:42,015
I want to find it.

25
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:45,643
Of course. I'll send a scout
to explore the area,

26
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,438
and come back
with more information.

27
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,609
I want to go now.

28
00:04:16,174 --> 00:04:17,342
The forest...

29
00:04:19,302 --> 00:04:21,930
...is moving.

30
00:04:52,043 --> 00:04:56,589
He had nothing left on Earth to conquer.

31
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:04,514
That's when he came
for my home.

32
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:15,817
Where's the entrance
to Ta Lo?

33
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:19,862
You're not welcome
in our village.

34
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:23,574
You don't know who
you're talking to.

35
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:25,827
I don't care who you are.

36
00:05:26,536 --> 00:05:30,373
Turn around now,
and I won't have to hurt you.

37
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,341
Is that all?

38
00:07:59,772 --> 00:08:03,192
That was the first time
I met your father.

39
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:09,824
He was the last person
I thought I'd fall for.

40
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:14,579
But love had other plans.

41
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:20,543
Shang-Chi,

42
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:23,504
there's much more to know
about the legend of the rings,

43
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:27,466
but you'll learn about that
when you're older.

44
00:08:28,134 --> 00:08:33,347
If Dad's rings were so powerful,
how did you beat him?

45
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:38,019
Where I'm from, we are empowered

46
00:08:38,102 --> 00:08:42,064
by the magic of the Great Protector.

47
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:49,197
When you have the heart of our dragon,

48
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:52,408
you can do some amazing things.

49
00:08:52,992 --> 00:08:55,870
Can you still do those things?

50
00:08:57,747 --> 00:09:01,959
I left those powers in Ta Lo
with our dragon,

51
00:09:02,126 --> 00:09:06,297
but what I got in return
is so much better.

52
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:11,844
I want you to have this.

53
00:09:13,638 --> 00:09:15,848
Whenever you feel lost,

54
00:09:16,015 --> 00:09:19,018
this will help you
find your way home.

55
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,270
Can you remember that?

56
00:14:55,271 --> 00:14:56,981
That seat's for Waigong.

57
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:04,655
He's getting all his favourite things
this year for the Day of the Dead.

58
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:10,619
He can take anything.

59
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:14,790
Last year I put a bottle of whisky
on his grave...

60
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:16,875
And it was gone the next morning.

61
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:21,463
I know you kids think it's silly.

62
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,972
When are you two going
to get married?

63
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:14,308
Waipo, we're just friends.

64
00:16:14,475 --> 00:16:16,935
All right. Go, go, go.

65
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:46,548
Give me the pendant,

66
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:48,842
and no one gets hurt.

67
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:02,189
I don't want any trouble.

68
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:04,191
Then give us the pendant!

69
00:28:36,341 --> 00:28:38,927
Sign here to get in.

70
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:45,308
I'm looking for my sister,
Xu Xialing.

71
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:47,644
Have you heard of her?

72
00:28:49,354 --> 00:28:51,606
This is the address she gave me.

73
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:15,171
Two million views
in three days, bro!

74
00:29:19,426 --> 00:29:20,844
And you're the driver!

75
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:50,290
Thanks!

76
00:32:42,295 --> 00:32:43,630
Sister.

77
00:32:48,885 --> 00:32:49,927
What are you doing?

78
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,686
I know you're upset.

79
00:32:58,853 --> 00:33:00,355
But can you hear me out?

80
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:06,110
We don't have time for this.

81
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:25,713
Can you please stop hitting me?

82
00:33:36,057 --> 00:33:39,060
Stop it! I'm trying to help you!

83
00:33:39,686 --> 00:33:41,854
Dad's coming for you.

84
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:47,777
I'm not fighting you.

85
00:33:48,695 --> 00:33:51,030
You shouldn't have come back.

86
00:33:56,536 --> 00:34:00,456
Sometimes when I'm doing my forms...

87
00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:03,751
I close my eyes,

88
00:34:03,918 --> 00:34:07,922
and it's like I can feel her.

89
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:11,008
Do you ever feel like that?

90
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:14,846
No.

91
00:34:38,494 --> 00:34:40,663
Please don't leave me here.

92
00:34:47,712 --> 00:34:50,757
I'll be back in three days.

93
00:35:35,092 --> 00:35:36,594
You run this place?

94
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,138
I own it.

95
00:40:44,985 --> 00:40:46,570
You left us for dead!

96
00:40:48,656 --> 00:40:50,616
Now you know how it feels.

97
00:43:12,132 --> 00:43:14,718
I've missed you, my son.

98
00:46:10,644 --> 00:46:12,855
That's enough.

99
00:49:37,184 --> 00:49:38,852
You know who's in there?

100
00:49:39,019 --> 00:49:40,854
Say, "Hello, little sister!"

101
00:54:32,437 --> 00:54:34,731
When will you stop pretending?

102
00:54:58,546 --> 00:55:01,716
It's okay, my dear.

103
00:55:08,348 --> 00:55:12,519
We're all going to be
together soon.

104
01:08:56,884 --> 01:08:59,011
Hi there!

105
01:08:59,261 --> 01:09:01,180
I am Xu Shang-Chi.

106
01:09:01,806 --> 01:09:04,600
This is my sister, Xu Xialing.

107
01:09:04,767 --> 01:09:07,311
We're Ying Li's children.

108
01:09:11,190 --> 01:09:12,691
This is my friend, Katy.

109
01:09:12,858 --> 01:09:16,487
Get in your car and go home!

110
01:09:16,654 --> 01:09:19,156
Please. You don't understand.

111
01:09:25,371 --> 01:09:26,997
Guang Bo!

112
01:09:28,374 --> 01:09:30,543
What are you doing?

113
01:09:31,168 --> 01:09:33,337
Put down your weapons!

114
01:09:36,298 --> 01:09:37,967
Shang-Chi.

115
01:09:38,425 --> 01:09:39,552
Xialing.

116
01:09:39,718 --> 01:09:42,972
I'm your aunty, Nan.

117
01:09:44,723 --> 01:09:47,434
I've waited so long to meet you.

118
01:09:57,111 --> 01:09:58,737
You look like your mother.

119
01:13:26,987 --> 01:13:28,906
To the range.

120
01:14:17,538 --> 01:14:18,997
Guang Bo.

121
01:14:20,249 --> 01:14:21,583
Let her shoot.

122
01:14:24,962 --> 01:14:28,632
If you aim at nothing,
you hit nothing.

123
01:16:03,310 --> 01:16:05,145
You're not in your
father's house any more.

124
01:16:06,897 --> 01:16:11,026
In Ta Lo, we train as equals.

125
01:16:12,778 --> 01:16:16,657
You've been in the shadows
long enough, my child.

126
01:20:12,184 --> 01:20:15,145
We'll be together soon.

127
01:20:55,852 --> 01:20:57,979
Lead with your breath.

128
01:20:58,438 --> 01:21:01,399
Look into your heart,

129
01:21:01,566 --> 01:21:04,903
the light and the dark.

130
01:21:05,070 --> 01:21:09,157
To know yourself,

131
01:21:09,324 --> 01:21:13,245
you must face them both.

132
01:21:27,968 --> 01:21:30,262
Your husband tried to destroy us.

133
01:21:30,845 --> 01:21:33,515
The Iron Gang is here
to repay that debt.

134
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:36,101
My husband is not the man
he used to be.

135
01:21:36,643 --> 01:21:38,103
It doesn't matter.

136
01:21:39,354 --> 01:21:42,607
Your business with him has nothing
to do with my children.

137
01:21:45,527 --> 01:21:47,404
They can go,

138
01:21:47,571 --> 01:21:51,366
but someone has to pay.

139
01:21:56,037 --> 01:21:57,872
Xialing. Shang-Chi.

140
01:21:58,039 --> 01:21:59,165
Go inside.

141
01:21:59,249 --> 01:22:01,960
I'm going to talk to our guests.

142
01:22:07,966 --> 01:22:10,802
But you don't have your powers.

143
01:22:13,513 --> 01:22:15,557
Shang-Chi, you have nothing to fear.

144
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:14,884
She told me I could change.

145
01:24:16,386 --> 01:24:19,639
That I could leave my past behind.

146
01:24:22,058 --> 01:24:24,561
But she was wrong.

147
01:24:27,772 --> 01:24:30,400
If I hadn't taken them off,

148
01:24:31,317 --> 01:24:35,280
those men wouldn't have dared
to do this.

149
01:24:37,741 --> 01:24:40,535
And now they will pay for it.

150
01:25:34,923 --> 01:25:35,965
Where's your boss?

151
01:25:36,424 --> 01:25:37,425
I don't know!

152
01:25:37,842 --> 01:25:39,427
I swear I don't!

153
01:25:41,012 --> 01:25:42,597
Okay.

154
01:25:55,944 --> 01:26:00,698
A blood debt has to be
paid by blood.

155
01:26:01,533 --> 01:26:03,326
Will you help me?

156
01:29:01,337 --> 01:29:04,590
A blood debt has to be
paid by blood.

157
01:30:23,294 --> 01:30:24,295
No!

158
01:30:24,462 --> 01:30:25,713
You're not ready.

159
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:27,924
She stays here.

160
01:31:46,794 --> 01:31:49,338
You fool. We turned you away.

161
01:31:49,505 --> 01:31:52,049
The sins of your past would have
destroyed this place.

162
01:31:52,383 --> 01:31:56,679
Be careful how you speak to me,
young man.

163
01:31:57,096 --> 01:32:00,892
I've lived ten of your lifetimes.

164
01:36:38,419 --> 01:36:40,129
Save me.

165
01:36:41,130 --> 01:36:43,466
Save me, my dear.

166
01:37:03,277 --> 01:37:05,154
Save me.

167
01:37:05,613 --> 01:37:08,032
I'm coming, my love.

168
01:38:58,225 --> 01:38:59,518
It's too dangerous.

169
01:39:05,232 --> 01:39:07,234
Don't die.

170
01:39:08,319 --> 01:39:11,071
Everyone to the water now!

171
01:39:27,504 --> 01:39:28,714
Save me.

172
01:39:53,155 --> 01:39:56,075
Aim at the sky,
to win or die!

173
01:40:09,838 --> 01:40:11,590
Deep breath.

174
01:40:27,481 --> 01:40:29,733
Shang-Chi, you have nothing to fear.

175
01:40:30,901 --> 01:40:33,070
You have the heart
of our dragon.

176
01:40:33,862 --> 01:40:37,199
I will always be a part of you.
And your dad will too.

177
01:40:37,825 --> 01:40:41,995
Take everything we've given you
and make it your own.

178
01:40:59,221 --> 01:41:01,473
I'm so proud of you.

179
01:41:05,811 --> 01:41:08,230
Our family needs you.

180
01:41:09,648 --> 01:41:11,150
Go.

181
01:42:04,787 --> 01:42:06,538
Draw.

182
01:42:10,501 --> 01:42:11,835
Fire!

183
01:47:42,541 --> 01:47:44,835
Let me out!

184
01:51:49,913 --> 01:51:54,376
If it gets our dragon's soul,
it will be unstoppable!

185
01:51:56,795 --> 01:51:58,296

01:53:52,619 --> 01:53:54,496
Go.

189
01:56:35,531 --> 01:56:37,867
Farewell, Dad.

01:56:38,201 --> 01:56:40,286
