<i>You and I will be reborn</i>

3
00:00:55,779 --> 00:00:57,713
<i>In a future place and time</i>

4
00:00:57,814 --> 00:01:03,183
<i>If everything our
Hindu brethren say is true</i>

5
00:01:04,086 --> 00:01:06,919
<i>In an age of things that hover</i>

6
00:01:07,022 --> 00:01:09,889
<i>You and I will still be lovers</i>

7
00:01:09,992 --> 00:01:11,789
<i>And we'll say to ourselves</i>

8
00:01:11,894 --> 00:01:14,089
<i>That was then and this is, too</i>

9
00:01:14,196 --> 00:01:15,527
<i>Doo-doo-be-doo, doo-doo</i>

10
00:01:15,631 --> 00:01:18,690
<i>'Cause we'll still find
the happening hot spots</i>

11
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,826
<i>We'll still cruise the cool casinos</i>

12
00:01:21,936 --> 00:01:24,404
<i>You'll still fly me to the moon</i>

13
00:01:24,505 --> 00:01:26,632
<i>Although the moon to which you fly me</i>

14
00:01:26,741 --> 00:01:28,538
<i>Could be Phobos or Deimos</i>

15
00:01:28,643 --> 00:01:31,111
<i>The psychic worms from Rigel nine</i>

16
00:01:31,212 --> 00:01:33,203
<i>Who control everything we do</i>

17
00:01:33,314 --> 00:01:34,781
<i>Will make us think that was then</i>

18
00:01:34,882 --> 00:01:39,079
<i>And 3010 is exactly the same as 1962</i>

19
00:01:39,186 --> 00:01:41,620
<i>Don't expect any changes, my friend</i>

20
00:01:41,722 --> 00:01:46,056
<i>That was then and this is, too</i>

21
00:01:51,665 --> 00:01:57,500
Wow, Mars Vegas.
Long live the eternal city.

22
00:01:57,603 --> 00:02:00,367
Two, one, zero!

23
00:02:03,442 --> 00:02:05,273
Rest in hell, Crapville!

24
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,347
Out here in the desert,
we're gonna build bigger, better Vegas.

25
00:02:15,453 --> 00:02:18,911
Bathtubs size of oceans,
hookers size of bouncers.

26
00:02:19,024 --> 00:02:20,514
Hamburger!

27
00:02:23,728 --> 00:02:25,662
<i>Stand clear of the closing jaws.</i>

28
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:35,529
Yo, you need any
girders bent, I know a guy.

29
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:37,734
So what's gonna
be over there, Dad?

30
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:39,536
That? That the oasis.

31
00:02:40,944 --> 00:02:43,538
Future site of Oasis Hotel.

32
00:02:45,149 --> 00:02:48,208
Take that,
you stupid Mother Nature.

33
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,819
Okay. Let's hit him hard.

34
00:02:52,021 --> 00:02:57,254
<i>This land is your land
This land is my land</i>

35
00:02:57,693 --> 00:02:59,354
Who are you noisy women?

36
00:02:59,662 --> 00:03:03,860
<i>I'm Frida Waterfall, leader of the
Greenorita Eco-Feminist Collective,</i>

37
00:03:03,966 --> 00:03:07,992
<i>and we will not let you man-doze
this beautiful gyno-desert.</i>

38
00:03:08,103 --> 00:03:10,765
Well, I'm Leo Wong, and I say, "Boom. "

39
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:27,582
Hey, what happened to my femi-necklace?
And where's my mega-fem?

40
00:03:30,825 --> 00:03:32,816
Is he badly hurt, Dr. Zoidberg?

41
00:03:32,993 --> 00:03:35,928
I don't quite know how to say this.

42
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,928
Fry is dead!

43
00:03:43,636 --> 00:03:45,570
Wait, not dead.
The other thing.

44
00:03:45,672 --> 00:03:47,139
Damn eco-broads!

45
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,835
You can't even spray for eagles
without upsetting these kooks.

46
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,874
Now, hang on.
Before you do construction,

47
00:03:56,983 --> 00:03:59,952
don't you have to make sure
you're not harming any native species?

48
00:04:00,053 --> 00:04:02,179
You mean, cursory
environmental survey?

49
00:04:02,287 --> 00:04:04,312
Already done! By top scientist.

50
00:04:05,757 --> 00:04:09,124
Oh, my, yes.
You've got the go-ahead, Mr. Wong.

51
00:04:09,228 --> 00:04:11,492
This place is deader than last year's cat.

52
00:04:11,597 --> 00:04:12,894
No, it's not!

53
00:04:12,998 --> 00:04:16,365
There's precious life
right here in this scum puddle.

54
00:04:17,102 --> 00:04:18,091
Ah!

55
00:04:18,203 --> 00:04:21,501
<i>Cyprinodon martius.
The desert muck leech.</i>

56
00:04:21,606 --> 00:04:26,168
Amazingly, the entire species
lives in this one tiny stinkhole.

57
00:04:26,277 --> 00:04:30,077
Killing these will be so much easier
than exterminating those ponies.

58
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:35,911
Wait a second.

59
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,250
Leeches may not be
cuddly like pandas or tribbles,

60
00:04:39,356 --> 00:04:41,381
but these poor
endangered creatures deserve...

61
00:04:42,826 --> 00:04:44,293
Get off me!

62
00:04:44,394 --> 00:04:48,524
I'll get it with my trusty foot cups:
Stompy and Smashy.

63
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:52,327
No, don't kill it! We have to...

64
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:02,376
There. They're not endangered anymore.
They're extinct.

65
00:05:03,612 --> 00:05:06,308
No, they're not. I saved this one.

66
00:05:06,415 --> 00:05:08,315
And I'm gonna raise it and care for it,

67
00:05:08,417 --> 00:05:10,408
so the world will
forever know what it's lost.

68
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,180
You freaking slime wad!

69
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:20,650
No. I killed it.
It was the last of its kind.

70
00:05:21,996 --> 00:05:24,988
Mother.
Let go of me, you...

71
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:29,500
Poor thing.

72
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:37,101
Tell you what, Fry.
You all promise not to sue me,

73
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:40,908
I give you token for free
entry in poker tournament.

74
00:05:41,014 --> 00:05:42,447
He took it, you all saw it!

75
00:05:42,549 --> 00:05:46,417
Maybe we did, maybe we didn't.
What's in it for me, Bender?

76
00:05:46,753 --> 00:05:49,721
Okay, okay. Come back
when New Vegas opens,

77
00:05:49,822 --> 00:05:51,187
I give you all free rooms,

78
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:54,384
free dinner and
free tickets to Celine Dion.

79
00:05:54,493 --> 00:05:58,122
Lose the Celine Dion tickets
and you got yourself a deal.

80
00:05:59,465 --> 00:06:01,126
All right, damn it, done!

81
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:03,359
All right, I scored.

82
00:06:12,744 --> 00:06:15,508
Look out, Vegas, I've got a system.

83
00:06:18,717 --> 00:06:19,706
Oh.

84
00:06:19,818 --> 00:06:21,012
I'm bankrupt.

85
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:24,815
You said it, Hermes.
He is pathetic, but lovable.

86
00:06:24,922 --> 00:06:27,516
Yup. What? I said no such thing, man.

87
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:31,994
I am not acting weird, Leela.
Why is everyone talking at once?

88
00:06:32,096 --> 00:06:34,087
Fry, calm down and stop braining.

89
00:06:34,198 --> 00:06:35,495
Yeah, Fry, maybe you need...

90
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:38,363
You're right, Amy!
Maybe I do need some fresh air.

91
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,904
Man, I'm worried about him.

92
00:06:42,006 --> 00:06:45,065
But not enough to stop
gambling for even a single second.

93
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,608
<i>You win, damn it!</i>

94
00:06:54,017 --> 00:06:56,281
It's all in the wrist.

95
00:07:09,031 --> 00:07:10,430
Voices always yelling.

96
00:07:10,532 --> 00:07:14,866
Who said that? I'm not insane.
Stop it. Stop talking in me!

97
00:07:16,138 --> 00:07:19,004
Voices bothering you, man?
I've been there.

98
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:21,301
You need one of these doodangs.

99
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:23,840
A foil hat?
Of course, he likes pastrami.

100
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,538
What about the dog's testicles?

101
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:31,311
Hey, it worked.
The voices stopped.

102
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:34,286
They've got a huge
selection of carburetors...

103
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:35,582
Hang on. Hang on.

104
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:42,661
That's better. My name's Hutch.

105
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:46,163
Hi, Hutch. So what's with the
obnoxious, shrieking voices?

106
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:48,097
<i>Are my fillings picking up The View?</i>

107
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:53,070
No, man. Truth is,
it's other people's thoughts.

108
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:54,367
You're a mind reader.

109
00:07:56,442 --> 00:08:00,469
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Although, actually, it was sort of obvious.

110
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:02,776
You don't believe me?
Take off the helmet.

111
00:08:02,881 --> 00:08:05,213
- I believe you.
- Seriously, do it.

112
00:08:07,052 --> 00:08:10,044
<i>Testing, testing.
Do you read me?</i>

113
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:12,551
<i>Loud and clear.
- What?</i>

114
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,716
I said, "Loud and clear. "

115
00:08:14,826 --> 00:08:16,760
Only I said it with my
thinker, not my talker.

116
00:08:16,861 --> 00:08:20,695
Whoa! Freaky.
Why can't I read your thoughts?

117
00:08:20,798 --> 00:08:23,824
I don't know. Wait.
What's that about a secret society?

118
00:08:23,935 --> 00:08:28,372
Never mind that. Just keep
the foil on and you'll be okay.

119
00:08:28,473 --> 00:08:33,034
Also, it'll keep the Dark Ones
from incinerating your brain.

120
00:08:33,143 --> 00:08:34,110
That's a plus.

121
00:08:34,211 --> 00:08:37,806
And don't ever, ever, ever
tell anyone you can read minds,

122
00:08:37,914 --> 00:08:41,077
or the Dark Ones
will get you like that.

123
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,687
Hang on, pizza grease.

124
00:08:45,088 --> 00:08:46,385
Like that.

125
00:09:04,673 --> 00:09:06,971
Jeez, get a load of
the batteries on her.

126
00:09:07,075 --> 00:09:09,009
I'd like to get my clamps on those.

127
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,737
Give her a jump,
you know what I mean?

128
00:09:11,946 --> 00:09:12,935
Whoa, whoa.

129
00:09:13,047 --> 00:09:16,039
Show some decorum there,
Clamps. This ain't no strip show.

130
00:09:16,151 --> 00:09:19,587
This is a beguiling display
of the pornographic arts.

131
00:09:19,687 --> 00:09:22,155
Yo, Skip, I can see a guy's butt.

132
00:09:22,724 --> 00:09:26,887
Oh, Michael, this is the perfect
end to a perfect honeymoon.

133
00:09:26,994 --> 00:09:28,052
I love you so much.

134
00:09:29,229 --> 00:09:31,129
- Is this seat taken?
- Actually, we...

135
00:09:31,231 --> 00:09:33,096
Slide me those chicken wings.

136
00:09:34,034 --> 00:09:36,332
So what part of
Podunk you rubes from?

137
00:09:36,437 --> 00:09:37,461
The north-eastern.

138
00:09:55,188 --> 00:09:57,053
<i>Monsieurs et mademoiselles,</i>

139
00:09:57,156 --> 00:10:03,890
<i>our circus of the senses now arrives
by steamboat in New Orleans, circa 2873.</i>

140
00:10:03,995 --> 00:10:07,590
<i>The muted lament of a trombone
resonates through the fog,</i>

141
00:10:07,699 --> 00:10:12,636
<i>which lingers even now, months
after the attack of the fog monster.</i>

142
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:16,400
<i>With but one hope of restoring
Gearoticus to his throne,</i>

143
00:10:16,508 --> 00:10:20,307

rests in the gyrations of</i>

00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,909
<i>Fanny.</i>

145
00:10:25,216 --> 00:10:26,240
Oh.

146
00:10:48,938 --> 00:10:49,927
Yes?

147
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:51,700
I'm Bender. Let's do it.

148
00:10:59,448 --> 00:11:00,472
Who is it, the Feds?

149
00:11:00,582 --> 00:11:04,416
Aren't you the Donbot,
head of the Robot Mafia?

150
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,455
Allegedly.
And this is my beloved wife, Fanny,

151
00:11:07,556 --> 00:11:10,286
whose honor I would
proudly defend with a power drill.

152
00:11:10,392 --> 00:11:12,553
Well, I gotta go drown a stoolie.

153
00:11:17,932 --> 00:11:21,766
I'm gonna be in here a while, so do
me a favor and drive my wife home.

154
00:11:22,703 --> 00:11:26,730
It's one of them self-driving cars, so
just sit in the back and do whatever.

155
00:11:30,011 --> 00:11:32,808
Oh, Bender,
your lips are intoxicating.

156
00:11:32,913 --> 00:11:36,144
It's like kissing
an ashtray full of hot wings.

157
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:52,423
<i>My God, I really can read minds.
I have a superpower!</i>

158
00:11:52,798 --> 00:11:55,562
<i>There must be something
great I can do with this.</i>

159
00:12:00,205 --> 00:12:02,799
Hello, ladies,
I can read your thoughts.

160
00:12:06,278 --> 00:12:08,177
Oh, wait, that's invisibility.

161
00:12:12,717 --> 00:12:16,414
<i>Poker. With my mind-reading
abilities and my invisibility...</i>

162
00:12:16,521 --> 00:12:19,012
<i>Wait, no, just the mind reading.
I can't lose!</i>

163
00:12:19,891 --> 00:12:21,620
Sign me up for the tournament, please.

164
00:12:21,726 --> 00:12:25,957
Okey-doke, Jiffy Pop.
Entry fee's 50,000 smackers.

165
00:12:26,063 --> 00:12:27,291
50,000?

166
00:12:28,465 --> 00:12:30,456
Drat, all I have is my life savings

167
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:34,128
and a token for free admission
to this poker tournament.

168
00:12:34,237 --> 00:12:35,465
Close enough.

169
00:12:41,979 --> 00:12:45,812
You're having an affair with
the head of the robot mafia's wife?

170
00:12:45,915 --> 00:12:48,179
Yup, this is
her I'm making out with.

171
00:12:50,386 --> 00:12:51,819
Bender, are you crazy?

172
00:12:51,921 --> 00:12:54,617
No, it's Fry who's crazy in this one.

173
00:12:54,724 --> 00:12:56,419
I'm not crazy.

174
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,015
You sure you're okay, Fry?

175
00:12:58,127 --> 00:13:00,561
I mean, you do have
tin foil on your head.

176
00:13:00,663 --> 00:13:02,823
So? You got a leech on your neck.

177
00:13:02,931 --> 00:13:06,423
And speaking of sucking on your
neck, want to go to a movie later?

178
00:13:06,534 --> 00:13:09,002
Hey, there!
How are you folks doing tonight?

179
00:13:09,104 --> 00:13:10,799
Great. What are the specials?

180
00:13:10,905 --> 00:13:14,705
Well, let's see now.
We've got a wonderful grizzly bear

181
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:17,243
that's been dipped in cornmeal
and lightly tormented.

182
00:13:17,345 --> 00:13:19,676
- Questions?
- What was the bear's name?

183
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,510
- Jojo.
- Ooh, I'll have him.

184
00:13:25,619 --> 00:13:27,314
- Hide me!
- Hey, Donbot,

185
00:13:27,421 --> 00:13:30,515
ain't that your wife what
with you had that wedding with?

186
00:13:30,824 --> 00:13:34,783
Donbot, honey!
What a pleasant shock!

187
00:13:34,895 --> 00:13:39,354
I was just having dinner alone,
when suddenly you walk in on us.

188
00:13:39,465 --> 00:13:40,523
Alone, huh?

189
00:13:44,137 --> 00:13:45,161
Where am I?

190
00:13:45,271 --> 00:13:50,208
I was exploring a wormhole through space
many light years from this restaurant,

191
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:53,107
when suddenly I was
surrounded by darkness.

192
00:13:53,212 --> 00:13:54,907
Hot, sexy darkness.

193
00:13:56,248 --> 00:14:01,208
Why, hello, Donbot! Hello, miss,
have we met? I'm Bender.

194
00:14:01,319 --> 00:14:03,787
The world's most sexual robot.

195
00:14:03,889 --> 00:14:07,120
I mean, the world's most
boundary-respecting robot.

196
00:14:07,492 --> 00:14:10,859
Nice to see you, Bender.
Welcome back to our universe.

197
00:14:10,962 --> 00:14:13,760
Listen, sugar, I stuck up
the Burlington Coat Factory

198
00:14:13,864 --> 00:14:16,924
and got you a little something.
It's a $49 value.

199
00:14:18,569 --> 00:14:21,629
Donbot, I love you!

200
00:14:21,739 --> 00:14:24,469
- Not really.
- Man, this is great!

201
00:14:24,575 --> 00:14:28,102
I always wanted to nail a dame
in a fur coat, and now's my chance.

202
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:34,080
I mean, if you'll introduce me to
one, sir. One as sexy as you, baby!

203
00:14:34,584 --> 00:14:35,778
Bender out.

204
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,924
I never felt so alive, Bender.

205
00:14:46,029 --> 00:14:49,430
Listen, this turquoise-encrusted
bra is worth 50 grand.

206
00:14:49,532 --> 00:14:52,728
Let's sell it and run off
before the Donbot gets wise.

207
00:14:52,835 --> 00:14:57,863
No. It will take a lot more money
than that to make a girl like you happy.

208
00:14:57,973 --> 00:15:00,237
- No, it won't.
- Yeah, it will. Shut up!

209
00:15:00,342 --> 00:15:06,212
We'll run off, but not till after I win
the Universal Poker Championship!

210
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:09,883
One entry, please.

211
00:15:09,984 --> 00:15:13,385
Bender, no! You can't beat
the best players in the universe.

212
00:15:13,488 --> 00:15:18,255
- You're not lucky enough.
- Oh, no? I'm 40% lucky.

213
00:15:18,359 --> 00:15:21,795
The scrap metal I'm made from
included a truckload of horseshoes

214
00:15:21,896 --> 00:15:26,161
from the luckiest racehorses in Mexico,
who had just been sent to a glue factory.

215
00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:30,692
- They don't sound so lucky to me.
- Not without their shoes.

216
00:15:40,547 --> 00:15:42,139
That's great!

217
00:15:47,286 --> 00:15:50,653
Here, Bendy, take this.
It will give you 70% more luck.

218
00:15:51,123 --> 00:15:53,523
It's the Donbot's lucky robot's foot.

219
00:15:53,626 --> 00:15:56,993
All right!
With two kinds of luck, I can't lose.

220
00:15:57,096 --> 00:15:59,496
No, wait, three.
I stepped on a leprechaun.

221
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,562
Yo, you see this over here over there?

222
00:16:03,668 --> 00:16:05,568
I'm powering up the clamps.

223
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,607
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let us not rush to judgment.

224
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:15,907
But, Skip, that was your lucky robot's
foot what came off of your lucky leg.

225
00:16:16,014 --> 00:16:19,541
While it is true that I did wake up
with only one foot this morning,

226
00:16:19,651 --> 00:16:22,642
there is no proof that my
beloved Fanny was involved.

227
00:16:22,753 --> 00:16:25,017
Aside from the hacksaw
I found under her pillow.

228
00:16:25,122 --> 00:16:28,421
Well, what about that Bender guy?
You want I should give him the clamps?

229
00:16:28,525 --> 00:16:32,518
Not yet, Clamps. Only one thing
can prove that he has my lucky foot.

230
00:16:32,629 --> 00:16:35,154
Torture with the clamps
or a clamp-like device?

231
00:16:35,532 --> 00:16:39,490
No. We are gonna sit tight and see
if he wins the poker tournament.

232
00:16:39,602 --> 00:16:42,298
He does, that proves
he's packing my lucky foot,

233
00:16:43,206 --> 00:16:44,468
in which event...

234
00:16:44,574 --> 00:16:45,973
The clamps!

235
00:16:47,777 --> 00:16:49,244
Or a clamp-like device.

236
00:16:53,115 --> 00:16:56,084
<i>Welcome viewers
who fell asleep with the TV on!</i>

237
00:16:56,184 --> 00:17:00,348
<i>It's the 3009 no-limit
hold 'em championship.</i>

238
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,789
I'm the massive head
of Penn Jillette,

239
00:17:04,893 --> 00:17:07,919
and here with a color
commentary, my partner Teller.

240
00:17:09,064 --> 00:17:11,624
Our act really didn't
change much when he died.

241
00:17:11,733 --> 00:17:13,724
Pardon me,
I'm new to this game.

242
00:17:13,835 --> 00:17:16,234
Is this duffle bag big
enough for all your money?

243
00:17:17,738 --> 00:17:20,536
Bender? Oh, boogers.
We're in the same tournament.

244
00:17:20,641 --> 00:17:22,871
Quick, get your entry fee
back before I bankrupt you.

245
00:17:22,977 --> 00:17:25,445
In your dreams, nutloaf.

246
00:17:26,647 --> 00:17:28,911
Bite my shiny metal hat.

247
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:37,812
<i>Tex Connecticut,
the pride of Kansas City, first to act.</i>

248
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,390
<i>Smiley Spiff, up next.</i>

249
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:47,794
<i>Looks like Boobs Vanderbilt
has a decent pair.</i>

250
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,664
<i>Also, she's got two eights.</i>

251
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:56,035
<i>And Bender Rodriguez picks
up a lucky deal right off the bat.</i>

252
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:04,241
<i>Two aces.
I'm thinking guitar solo.</i>

253
00:18:08,386 --> 00:18:09,353
I fold.

254
00:18:09,453 --> 00:18:14,083
Holy crap! A stunning play by
mentally ill newcomer Philip Fry.

255
00:18:14,191 --> 00:18:17,592
It's almost as if
he knew Bender had two aces.

256
00:18:17,695 --> 00:18:19,856
Bender has two aces? I'm out.

257
00:18:19,964 --> 00:18:21,431
- I'm out.
- I'm out.

258
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:24,161
Suck my luck!

259
00:18:26,903 --> 00:18:28,427
See this gun?

260
00:18:29,472 --> 00:18:32,066
That's what I'm gonna
do to Bender if he wins.

261
00:18:41,318 --> 00:18:45,344
All in. Call my mighty bid at your peril.

262
00:18:48,691 --> 00:18:51,387
<i>My cards are awful, and I need a hug.</i>

263
00:18:52,261 --> 00:18:54,195
I call your bluff.

264
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,363
I shall annihilate...

265
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:05,403
I just wanted to
make my daddy proud.

266
00:19:05,974 --> 00:19:09,341
Well, you didn't. I want you and
your junk moved out by Monday.

267
00:19:09,577 --> 00:19:11,238
It's getting
pretty intense, folks.

268
00:19:11,346 --> 00:19:13,871
Based on the state of
decomposition of Teller's head,

269
00:19:13,982 --> 00:19:16,678
we're now in hour
19 of the tournament.

270
00:19:16,784 --> 00:19:20,185
And the first bad deal
of the night for Bender.

271
00:19:20,288 --> 00:19:24,087
Hey, pal, help me out here.
This is the worst possible hand, right?

272
00:19:24,191 --> 00:19:25,180
I'm all in.

273
00:19:25,292 --> 00:19:27,192
All in! I mean, fold. Whatever.

274
00:19:29,062 --> 00:19:33,692
Well, Bender's luck just ran out.
No card can save him from elimination.

275
00:19:35,769 --> 00:19:37,999
Oh, my gourds! He's dead.

276
00:19:39,672 --> 00:19:41,663
21, winner!

277
00:19:43,009 --> 00:19:46,809
I'm so full of luck,
it's shooting out like luck diarrhea.

278
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,011
<i>Wake up, poker fans!</i>

279
00:19:50,116 --> 00:19:54,644
We're down to our final two players in
heads-up action for the Championship.

280
00:19:54,754 --> 00:19:56,778
Your perspective, Teller?

281
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,937
All in.

282
00:20:24,648 --> 00:20:26,673
But you didn't even
look at your cards!

283
00:20:26,784 --> 00:20:31,278
Looking at one's cards is
a crutch for players who rely on skill.

284
00:20:37,593 --> 00:20:39,561
Any day now, Fry. You in or out?

285
00:20:42,865 --> 00:20:46,426
What's the matter, Fry,
you scared? Or just crazy?

286
00:20:48,037 --> 00:20:50,096
All right, all in.

287
00:20:55,444 --> 00:20:58,106
Yes! Four aces!

288
00:20:58,213 --> 00:20:59,612
Ah-ah-ah.

289
00:20:59,714 --> 00:21:03,241
Read 'em and weep,
and then tell me what they are.

290
00:21:03,351 --> 00:21:08,050
Two kings. And with three on the board,
that gives Bender five kings.

291
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:12,623
- But how is that...
- I don't believe it.

292
00:21:12,726 --> 00:21:15,627
Bender has just been
dealt the King of Beers,

293
00:21:15,729 --> 00:21:19,187
a coaster from the bar that
somehow got mixed into the deck.

294
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,731
But it still counts!

295
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,330
Bender win the Championship!

296
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,907
That's some good money.

297
00:21:30,743 --> 00:21:34,839
You did it, Bender.
You're the greatest.

298
00:21:34,948 --> 00:21:36,779
Tell me something
I don't know, sweetass.

299
00:21:36,883 --> 00:21:37,872
Now, let's boogie.

300
00:21:37,984 --> 00:21:41,818
We'll be in Space Tahiti before
the Donbot knows what hit him.

301
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,414
Now I am suspicious.

302
00:21:55,367 --> 00:21:58,825
Okay, we finished digging this
shallow grave. Can we go now?

303
00:22:37,407 --> 00:22:39,966
Poor Bender left me one last voicemail

304
00:22:40,075 --> 00:22:43,806
before the Robot Mafia
buried him in the desert.

305
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:48,108
<i>Fry, old friend,
before I die, I just wanted to say...</i>

306
00:22:49,351 --> 00:22:51,444
<i>Hang on, I'm getting another call. Hello?</i>

307
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:58,516
Line up, people! Everyone take
a shovel and one sixth of the planet.

308
00:22:58,626 --> 00:23:03,188
We'll meet back here in 50 years,
our bodies broken and our lives wasted.

309
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:05,323
And you say these are free shovels?

310
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:13,399
I'm back, baby.

311
00:23:13,508 --> 00:23:16,203
Bender! I thought the
Robot Mafia killed you.

312
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:20,212
Nah, they just shot us and buried us
a few times as a warning.

313
00:23:20,314 --> 00:23:22,214
Bender was so brave.

314
00:23:22,316 --> 00:23:25,581
He never stopped making out with me
the whole time they were shooting us.

315
00:23:25,686 --> 00:23:26,914
I sure didn't.

316
00:23:27,487 --> 00:23:30,081
I gotta get back to my husband, baby.
Will I see you tonight?

317
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,384
Probably not.

318
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:42,229
It's a 14-footer with a clown hazard.
What club you recommend, Baggy?

319
00:23:42,335 --> 00:23:44,895
As on every hole,
I suggest the putter.

320
00:23:47,273 --> 00:23:50,868
Your golf club sure is classy,
Mr. Wong. Naked statue classy.

321
00:23:54,713 --> 00:23:56,203
It is very nice.

322
00:23:56,314 --> 00:24:00,341
I just wish Amy and I didn't have to
wear these sexist badges on our melons.

323
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:03,553
We're lucky even to play as guests, Leela.

324
00:24:03,655 --> 00:24:06,852
Dad's club has a very
strict "No girls allowed" policy.

325
00:24:09,027 --> 00:24:11,494
- That doesn't seem fair.
- It really is.

326
00:24:11,595 --> 00:24:13,620
Everybody knows women
don't have the focus

327
00:24:13,731 --> 00:24:16,791
to play miniature golf
at a professional level.

328
00:24:18,035 --> 00:24:20,299
But that's the
best shot of the day!

329
00:24:20,404 --> 00:24:22,634
Is that my ball?
I think that my ball.

330
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:29,707
- Great putt, Dad.
- Okay, we're done.

331
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,538
Mr. Wong, how do you keep this place
so green in the middle of the desert?

332
00:24:34,651 --> 00:24:36,141
Doesn't that waste a lot of water?

333
00:24:36,252 --> 00:24:39,983
Nah, we got plenty water,
pumped directly from flamingo lake.

334
00:24:46,295 --> 00:24:47,887
They'll be fine.

335
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:54,032
Oh, yeah, I love miniature golf.
Love everything about it,

336
00:24:54,136 --> 00:24:56,070
except how damn miniature it is.

337
00:24:56,171 --> 00:24:59,800
That's why I'm building the universe's
biggest miniature golf course.

338
00:25:04,078 --> 00:25:06,876
- This the first tee.
- Where's the hole?

339
00:25:06,981 --> 00:25:08,676
On Pluto's moon, Hydra.

340
00:25:08,783 --> 00:25:12,981
It's a six-billion-mile par-two.
Tough shot, even for a man.

341
00:25:28,835 --> 00:25:32,362
Around the sun.
Bank off Jupiter.

342
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,900
And right into the...

343
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:38,601
I'll be right back.

344
00:25:58,429 --> 00:26:00,556
<i>It dropped in!
Put me down for a two.</i>

345
00:26:01,966 --> 00:26:03,126
Two.

346
00:26:06,804 --> 00:26:09,432
Keep in mind,
that just the first hole.

347
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:13,374
For full course, we gonna bulldoze
this entire arm of the Milky Way.

348
00:26:13,478 --> 00:26:18,176
What? You're gonna wipe out 10%
of the galaxy for a stupid golf course?

349
00:26:18,281 --> 00:26:21,717
First of all, it 12%.
Second, yes, you betcha.

350
00:26:21,818 --> 00:26:25,447
But you have no idea what life
forms might be evolving out there.

351
00:26:25,555 --> 00:26:28,251
That's exactly why
I'm hiring an impartial scientist

352
00:26:28,358 --> 00:26:31,919
to perform an environmental survey.
That's him in the money shower.

353
00:26:35,331 --> 00:26:39,495
<i>Delivery boy's log. Having fallen
asleep on what I thought was the toilet,</i>

354
00:26:39,602 --> 00:26:42,867
<i>I awoke to find
the environmental survey in progress.</i>

355
00:26:43,139 --> 00:26:48,236
- Status reports, Science Officer.
- Zilcho. No sign of life or intelligence.

356
00:26:52,547 --> 00:26:54,037
<i>Just like Fry on a date.</i>

357
00:26:54,149 --> 00:26:55,446
Hey!

358
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:58,417
Okay, so we haven't
found any life yet.

359
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:03,082
I still don't see why you men can't be
happy with regular-sized miniature golf.

360
00:27:03,458 --> 00:27:07,087
Leela, evolution has
programmed our fabulous male brains

361
00:27:07,195 --> 00:27:11,563
to take anything anybody else thinks
is important and make it bigger.

362
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:16,660
Have you seen my new 301-inch TV?

363
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:21,230
<i>Hypnotoad is brought to
you by the MagnaPhallix 302-inch TV.</i>

364
00:27:21,575 --> 00:27:23,042
<i>It's bigger!</i>

365
00:27:23,477 --> 00:27:24,444
Oh, hell!

366
00:27:28,381 --> 00:27:31,111
Captain, I'm detecting
life on the spock-o-scope!

367
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:50,966
It's amazing. It's like
a textbook on evolution.

368
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:52,093
Except in Kansas.

369
00:27:52,204 --> 00:27:54,832
But isn't Mr. Wong
building the 18th hole here?

370
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,532
And the golf pants museum?

371
00:27:56,641 --> 00:28:00,042
Indeed so. This whole
area will be incinerated

372
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:03,114
when he implodes that
sun there into a black hole.

373
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:04,942
That beautiful violet star?

374
00:28:05,049 --> 00:28:08,382
It's so you can't keep
your ball at the end of the game.

375
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:10,044
Yo, that's messed up.

376
00:28:10,154 --> 00:28:14,147
Well, there won't be any imploding once
they read our environmental review.

377
00:28:14,258 --> 00:28:16,954
- Right, Professor?
- Twaddle-squat.

378
00:28:17,061 --> 00:28:20,588
There's no scientific
consensus that life is important.

379
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:22,494
Yeah. Life, schmife.

380
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,491
<i>Approved for demolition.</i>

381
00:28:26,603 --> 00:28:28,366
It's you and me, ponytail.

382
00:28:36,513 --> 00:28:37,605
We're here, Mr. President.

383
00:28:39,315 --> 00:28:41,339
Let's play some mini-golf.

384
00:28:41,917 --> 00:28:45,978
Now, just give it a light tap, Agnew.
No, no, no, just a light...

385
00:28:49,458 --> 00:28:51,756
Now for a triple clam dip, with a double...

386
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,884
Ow!

387
00:28:56,732 --> 00:29:01,361
Tough luck, Agnew. Looks like you
and Wong owe me a Charleston Chew.

388
00:29:05,973 --> 00:29:07,964
<i>- Shut up and hear our wisdom.

- Save the ecosystem.</i>

390
00:29:10,077 --> 00:29:13,706
<i>Shut up and hear
our wisdom! Save the ecosystem!</i>

391
00:29:14,081 --> 00:29:17,015
What gives, Wong?
You said no chicks allowed.

392
00:29:18,652 --> 00:29:21,712
<i>We are the Greenorita
Eco-Feminist Collective,</i>

393
00:29:21,821 --> 00:29:25,257
<i>and we will not let you...
What was it again?</i>

394
00:29:25,358 --> 00:29:28,486
<i>We will not let you implode
the violet dwarf star</i>

<i>at galactic coordinates

396
00:29:35,234 --> 00:29:37,498
Already approved, you cackling hens.

397
00:29:37,603 --> 00:29:41,106
So get out, or I'll have vice-president
Agnew's headless body throw you out.

398
00:29:41,373 --> 00:29:43,307
<i>I'd like to see him try.</i>

399
00:29:43,409 --> 00:29:46,435
Me, too. Should look funny.
Sic 'em, Agnew.

400
00:29:51,383 --> 00:29:53,509
Runaway golf cart!

401
00:29:53,618 --> 00:29:55,313
Look out, Agnew!

402
00:29:57,655 --> 00:29:58,747
- Whoa!
- Aah!

403
00:30:02,493 --> 00:30:04,484
Is he okay?

404
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:06,995
No pulse.

405
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:12,297
They killed the headless
remains of Agnew. Arrest them!

406
00:30:14,471 --> 00:30:17,736
<i>All feministas
she-vacuate the premises.</i>

407
00:30:17,841 --> 00:30:19,468
<i>I mean "femises. "</i>

408
00:30:29,352 --> 00:30:31,252
<i>My fellow Earthicans,</i>

409
00:30:31,354 --> 00:30:34,881
<i>these eco-crooks will
face the maximum sentence.</i>

410
00:30:34,991 --> 00:30:37,653
<i>For killing a headless
torso, that's six weeks.</i>

411
00:30:37,893 --> 00:30:39,417
Well, this is embarrassing.

412
00:30:39,528 --> 00:30:43,191
Here I've been blabbing on
for years about killing all humans,

413
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:46,063
and who actually does
something about it? Some chick.

414
00:30:46,168 --> 00:30:49,068
Leela's not a killer,
and she's not some chick.

415
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:50,899
She's the chick I love.

416
00:30:51,006 --> 00:30:53,440
And don't tell her
I called her a chick, or she'll kill me.

417
00:31:08,522 --> 00:31:10,922
<i>Everyone stay absolutely quiet!</i>

418
00:31:11,025 --> 00:31:12,185
- That thing's on.
- Turn it off!

419
00:31:12,292 --> 00:31:13,316
<i>Oh, sorry.</i>

420
00:31:13,427 --> 00:31:15,292
How do you turn it off?

421
00:31:15,396 --> 00:31:17,023
<i>There. Did that do it?</i>

422
00:31:17,131 --> 00:31:18,325
No. Stop it. Shut up.

423
00:31:18,432 --> 00:31:20,400
Here's the button here.

424
00:31:22,136 --> 00:31:23,762
And I think I... Now I got it.

425
00:31:25,238 --> 00:31:26,865
Let me give you a hand.

426
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:29,902
This is awful.

427
00:31:30,009 --> 00:31:33,638
I never meant for our protest to
have any effect. Now what do we do?

428
00:31:33,746 --> 00:31:36,806
Maybe we should just surrender
and serve our six weeks in jail.

429
00:31:36,916 --> 00:31:40,476
Hey, yeah! We could do each
other's toenails and make shivs.

430
00:31:42,587 --> 00:31:45,055
That's crazy.
We've done nothing wrong,

431
00:31:45,157 --> 00:31:48,183
other than killing and
dismembering the vice-president.

432
00:31:48,293 --> 00:31:50,386
We need to make a choice, sisters.

433
00:31:50,495 --> 00:31:54,659
We can either keep pestering criminals
like Leo Wong with silly slogans...

434
00:31:54,766 --> 00:31:56,358
- Yeah.
- Let's do that.

435
00:31:56,935 --> 00:32:00,392
Actually, I meant that to be
the less preferable alternative.

436
00:32:00,504 --> 00:32:05,601
We can either chant slogans
or we can take action.

437
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:07,302
What was the first choice again?

438
00:32:07,411 --> 00:32:12,348
I choose to save the environment by
sabotaging Leo Wong's golf course.

439
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:14,077
Who's with me?

440
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:16,951
Could we still use our bullhorns?

441
00:32:17,053 --> 00:32:18,179
Absolutely.

442
00:32:18,288 --> 00:32:20,916
Bullhorns are a core
principle of eco-feminism.

443
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:22,082
Then I'm in.

444
00:32:25,495 --> 00:32:27,725
<i>Uh, take that</i>

445
00:32:27,831 --> 00:32:29,230
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

446
00:32:29,332 --> 00:32:30,959
<i>Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah</i>

447
00:32:31,067 --> 00:32:33,661
<i>Izzy, Izzy, ah
Zizah, zizah, zizah</i>

448
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:36,135
<i>Girls be talkin'
Like they all rah, rah</i>

449
00:32:36,605 --> 00:32:39,005
Who's ready to kick
some sweaty man-butt?

450
00:32:40,976 --> 00:32:44,036
I've got my pointy
man-kicking shoes on.

451
00:32:44,146 --> 00:32:45,272
Those are cute.

452
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,541
Aren't they?
I got them at Nine West.

453
00:32:47,649 --> 00:32:50,675
Simmer down, warriors.
Full power to the vagyroscope!

454
00:33:00,428 --> 00:33:01,827
Those dirty rings.

455
00:33:01,929 --> 00:33:04,693
I tried soaking them out,
even blasting them out.

456
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,434
Are you sure about this?

457
00:33:14,541 --> 00:33:18,170
It would be better for propaganda
if we weren't using refined sugar.

458
00:33:18,278 --> 00:33:22,180
It's okay. The potato we're
shoving in the tailpipe is organic.

459
00:33:28,588 --> 00:33:30,384
I smell sabotage.

460
00:33:31,724 --> 00:33:32,918
And potatoes.

461
00:33:36,729 --> 00:33:40,187
Now, unfortunately, the media is
going to put a negative spin on this,

462
00:33:40,299 --> 00:33:41,664
like when we killed that guy,

463
00:33:41,767 --> 00:33:45,032
so to win public support,
we'll need a lovable mascot.

464
00:33:51,075 --> 00:33:53,873
Squirm all you want,
you nasty dumpling.

465
00:33:54,012 --> 00:33:57,277
One less species for the universe,
one more breakfast for...

466
00:33:57,382 --> 00:33:59,873
- Zoidberg?
- Leela.

467
00:33:59,984 --> 00:34:03,010
Me saving things the leech.
Not the eating of it.

468
00:34:03,121 --> 00:34:06,283
Zoidberg, I'm very surprised
at you, slightly.

469
00:34:15,065 --> 00:34:18,398
- Psst! Leela.
- Shh! I'm a fugitive.

470
00:34:18,502 --> 00:34:22,438
I know. I miss you so much, Leela,
even more than when you were here.

471
00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:24,306
I miss you, too, Fry.

472
00:34:24,407 --> 00:34:26,671
And you probably think
what I'm doing is wrong.

473
00:34:26,776 --> 00:34:28,403
But it's something
I really care about...

474
00:34:28,511 --> 00:34:30,342
You don't have to explain, Leela.

475
00:34:30,446 --> 00:34:33,313
You're you.
That's all I need to know.

476
00:34:36,118 --> 00:34:38,586
Goodbye, sweet goofbag.

477
00:34:51,099 --> 00:34:53,067
I'll miss her, too, buddy.

478
00:34:53,168 --> 00:34:55,329
- Dibs on her iPod.
- Dibs on...

479
00:34:57,973 --> 00:35:00,532
Hey, Fry! Long time, man.

480
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:02,438
Hey, Hutch! What have you been up to?

481
00:35:02,543 --> 00:35:04,738
Same old, same old.
Searching the dumpsters,

482
00:35:04,845 --> 00:35:08,042
protecting my thoughts
with tin foil, peeing myself.

483
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:09,547
So, what brings you to Earth?

484
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:13,416
It's top secret. Hey, take off
your helmet and I'll think it to you.

485
00:35:13,921 --> 00:35:16,253
Okay. Here goes.

486
00:35:42,337 --> 00:35:44,396
Where are you? And me?

487
00:35:44,506 --> 00:35:49,034
The Great Hall of
the Ancient Legion of Madfellows.

488
00:35:49,144 --> 00:35:50,111
Welcome, bro.

489
00:35:50,212 --> 00:35:51,577
- Welcome, bro.
- Welcome, bro.

490
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,876
Sorry I bashed your
head in, buddy, but I had to.

491
00:35:54,982 --> 00:35:58,543
You see, the fate of the
universe depends on you.

492
00:35:58,652 --> 00:36:02,645
- Yeah, I get that a lot.
- The Grand Curator will tell you more.

493
00:36:02,756 --> 00:36:04,189
Take me to him.

494
00:36:04,291 --> 00:36:05,918
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

495
00:36:06,026 --> 00:36:07,584
So dig this, Fry.

496
00:36:07,695 --> 00:36:11,130
Our commune has been
monitoring the universe's life energy

497
00:36:11,231 --> 00:36:16,294
for, like, a really long time,
and we're grokking some super weird junk.

498
00:36:16,669 --> 00:36:19,797
I don't mean to be rude, but it's
kind of hard to take you seriously

499
00:36:19,906 --> 00:36:22,340
when you say junk
like "grok" and "junk. "

500
00:36:22,442 --> 00:36:25,138
- What about "commune"?
- Especially "commune. "

501
00:36:25,245 --> 00:36:27,941
Come on, it's the fate of
the universe, puff it up a little.

502
00:36:28,047 --> 00:36:30,173
Like you could say
your ancient order is sensing

503
00:36:30,282 --> 00:36:32,876
deep upheaval in the
cosmic life energy field.

504
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:41,254
Okay. I'll try. So, like,
a really, really long time ago...

505
00:36:42,828 --> 00:36:44,921
Eons ago!

506
00:36:46,265 --> 00:36:47,492
Cool.

507
00:36:47,732 --> 00:36:53,534
Eons ago, the life force we call
Chee permeated the universe.

508
00:36:55,973 --> 00:37:01,138
The Green Chee generated a great
upwelling of life across the cosmos.

509
00:37:01,245 --> 00:37:03,839
But then, for reasons unknown...

510
00:37:03,948 --> 00:37:06,142
Ooh. "Reasons unknown. "

511
00:37:06,249 --> 00:37:09,218
Now that's the sort of hook that
grabs the attention of me, the viewer.

512
00:37:09,319 --> 00:37:10,843
For reasons unknown...

513
00:37:10,954 --> 00:37:12,114
Nice.

514
00:37:12,222 --> 00:37:18,252
...the Chee began to recede,
and the diversity of life began to wither.

515
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,522
The life forms we know today

516
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:25,157
are but a fraction of a fraction of
the magnificence that once existed.

517
00:37:25,601 --> 00:37:27,034
But a bunch of dudes, right,

518
00:37:27,136 --> 00:37:30,628
they totally passed this far-out
knowledge down through the ages.

519
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:33,433
Some with
this knowledge were called prophets,

520
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:39,105
some, fruitcakes. We, the Legion
of Madfellows, are their heirs.

521
00:37:39,682 --> 00:37:41,013
Hey, I'm on TV.

522
00:37:42,517 --> 00:37:45,350
- Well, that's the show.
- Neat. What's it got to do with me?

523
00:37:46,554 --> 00:37:50,422
Pooperdoodle!
I mean, pardon the omission.

524
00:37:50,858 --> 00:37:57,263
You see, after untold eternities,
we have sensed a resurgence in the Chee.

525
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,335
Hey, that's the violet dwarf star
that Leela wants to save.

526
00:38:02,803 --> 00:38:04,498
Freaking nailed it, corndog.

527
00:38:04,604 --> 00:38:08,131
We believe this star
heralds a new green age,

528
00:38:08,241 --> 00:38:12,735
and it's your destiny to be
its shepherd and protector.

529
00:38:12,846 --> 00:38:14,370
Me? Why?

530
00:38:14,481 --> 00:38:17,109
'Cause you got, like,
no delta brainwave, man.

531
00:38:17,217 --> 00:38:19,446
The Dark Ones can't
groove off your thoughts.

532
00:38:19,552 --> 00:38:23,386
Silence, Hutch!
You shall learn more in time, Fry.

533
00:38:23,489 --> 00:38:26,151
But for now,
let's just say we have enemies,

534
00:38:26,258 --> 00:38:31,093
enemies who can read
minds, except yours.

535
00:38:31,197 --> 00:38:33,324
Cool. I can't wait to tell Leela.

536
00:38:33,432 --> 00:38:37,060
No! If you tell anyone,
then their thoughts could be read,

537
00:38:37,168 --> 00:38:39,659
and our enemies would
know of our existence.

538
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:43,638
For the sake of those you love,
you must keep this secret.

539
00:38:43,742 --> 00:38:47,906
- Do you foot-swear?
- Okay. I foot-swear.

540
00:38:48,613 --> 00:38:52,014
Good. Now, to save the
coming of the green age,

541
00:38:52,117 --> 00:38:54,584
you must stop this man.

542
00:38:56,553 --> 00:38:59,420
I know him. Leo Wong.
I work with his daughter.

543
00:38:59,523 --> 00:39:02,424
Good, that will cut about
15 minutes of explanation.

544
00:39:02,526 --> 00:39:06,485
You must gain Wong's confidence,
infiltrate his organization

545
00:39:06,597 --> 00:39:10,055
and prevent him from
destroying the violet dwarf.

546
00:39:15,705 --> 00:39:18,173
- Looking for a job, eh?
- Yes, sir.

547
00:39:18,274 --> 00:39:22,142
Nothing fancy. I'm willing to start at
the bottom and infiltrate my way up.

548
00:39:22,245 --> 00:39:24,372
Sorry, no openings right now.

549
00:39:24,914 --> 00:39:28,179
<i>What I need is security guard to
keep nutcases out of my office.</i>

550
00:39:28,284 --> 00:39:31,047
- I'm good at keeping nutcases.
- I said no way.

551
00:39:31,987 --> 00:39:33,454
<i>Security guard gotta be tough.</i>

552
00:39:33,555 --> 00:39:36,291
<i>This idiot don't look like
he could handle those feministas.</i>

553
00:39:36,491 --> 00:39:39,983
I look like an idiot who
can handle those feministas.

554
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:41,891
<i>He'll have to do better than that.</i>

555
00:39:41,997 --> 00:39:43,828
I'll have to do better than that.

556
00:39:43,932 --> 00:39:46,594
Hmm. You and I think a lot alike.

557
00:39:46,701 --> 00:39:49,191
You really think you can
stand up to those eco-freakos?

558
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:52,431
Sir, with me around,
they'll be the least of your worries.

559
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:07,850
Stand by, men. And manly aliens.
Prepare to test fire King Kong hole.

560
00:40:18,431 --> 00:40:20,092
It workses.

561
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,259
Good job, men. And manly aliens.

562
00:40:22,702 --> 00:40:25,499
Construction of
King Kong hole complete.

563
00:40:25,604 --> 00:40:29,631
Typical.
Always King Kong, never Queen Quong.

564
00:40:43,754 --> 00:40:47,155
What are those, hooks?
Get out of heres, you hookers.

565
00:40:47,258 --> 00:40:48,919
This is my turfs.

566
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:55,198
Helpses!

567
00:41:00,904 --> 00:41:02,496
You go, gorilla!

568
00:41:03,173 --> 00:41:06,165
Our top story.
The string of eco-vandalism

569
00:41:06,276 --> 00:41:09,074
that began with a harmless
vice-presidential killing

570
00:41:09,179 --> 00:41:11,044
has spread across the galaxy.

571
00:41:11,248 --> 00:41:13,910
Why do you always get to
read the top story, Morbo?

572
00:41:14,017 --> 00:41:19,079
Because viewers trust a deep male
voice and huge, throbbing forehead veins.

573
00:41:21,524 --> 00:41:24,459
Not all reaction to the crime
spree has been negative.

574
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,860
We spoke with several people who viewed
these courageous eco-feminists as heroes.

575
00:41:29,431 --> 00:41:32,559
I just wish there was
some way to... Excuse me.

576
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:38,596
Some way to show I support 'em.
Send them some smokes or something.

577
00:41:38,706 --> 00:41:42,164
So you make more than
twice what I do. What?

578
00:41:42,277 --> 00:41:45,838
This just in: Root 2 News has
received a video communique

579
00:41:45,947 --> 00:41:47,938
from the eco-feminists'
unknown hideout.

580
00:41:48,416 --> 00:41:50,077
This is sub-commander L.,

581
00:41:50,185 --> 00:41:53,177
den mother of the
Feminista Revolutionary Collective,

582
00:41:53,288 --> 00:41:55,653
with a message for Leo Wong.

583
00:41:55,756 --> 00:42:00,716
Leo, you're a parasite on the universe,
and parasites must be destroyed.

584
00:42:00,827 --> 00:42:04,126
That's why we've adopted
this parasite as our mascot.

585
00:42:05,666 --> 00:42:07,156
I know it's a little confusing.

586
00:42:07,267 --> 00:42:11,260
The point is, even this
vicious leech has a right to exist,

587
00:42:11,371 --> 00:42:13,133
because it's a part of nature.

588
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:17,699
And that's why a vicious leech
like Leo Wong must be exterminated.

589
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:21,440
Again, confusing.

590
00:42:21,547 --> 00:42:24,812
We call on women
everywhere to join our struggle

591
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:27,545
against eco-chauvinist Leo Wong.

592
00:42:27,653 --> 00:42:30,018
We especially need
good communique writers.

593
00:42:30,121 --> 00:42:31,588
Feministas unite!

594
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:35,387
- In other news...
- Feministas unite!

595
00:42:38,129 --> 00:42:40,029
<i>Feministas unite!</i>

596
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:43,765
Incredible. Absolutely incredible.

597
00:42:43,868 --> 00:42:48,167
You're telling me this TiVo machine
can pause and rewind live TV?

598
00:42:48,272 --> 00:42:50,536
These crazy broads
gonna ruin me, Nixon.

599
00:42:50,641 --> 00:42:52,632
You gotta help me.
Send the army or something.

600
00:42:52,743 --> 00:42:54,176
Something big that shoots.

601
00:42:54,278 --> 00:42:57,509
Sir, I don't care if you
are my biggest contributor.

602
00:42:57,615 --> 00:43:00,948
Our armed forces do not serve
your private business interests.

603
00:43:01,085 --> 00:43:02,074
Sorry, I...

604
00:43:04,421 --> 00:43:08,857
I'm just yanking your chain, Leo.
I'm on it like boring on Gerry Ford.

605
00:43:14,197 --> 00:43:16,791
Zapp Brannigan purporting for duty.

606
00:43:16,899 --> 00:43:20,198
For the love of God, Kif,
less piccolo, more fife.

607
00:43:21,771 --> 00:43:23,136
Report, Brannigan.

608
00:43:23,273 --> 00:43:26,730
Mr. President, I failed to identify
these curvaceous banditas

609
00:43:26,842 --> 00:43:29,310
despite hours of staring
at their dossiers.

610
00:43:30,012 --> 00:43:32,742
Yet, I seemed to have
stroked myself upon good luck,

611
00:43:32,848 --> 00:43:36,682
for a patriot of the highest order
has volunteered to lead us to them.

612
00:43:42,957 --> 00:43:45,357
These eco-feminists
are ruthless criminals

613
00:43:45,459 --> 00:43:47,859
who'll stop at nothing
to save the environment.

614
00:43:47,962 --> 00:43:50,226
I don't see how
a bending unit can catch them.

615
00:43:50,331 --> 00:43:52,765
<i>Not just any bending unit,
Presidente.</i>

616
00:43:52,867 --> 00:43:56,303
I happen to be brilliant,
fearless and short on cash.

617
00:43:56,404 --> 00:43:57,928
Short on cash.

618
00:43:58,039 --> 00:43:59,404
Slush him, Kroker.

619
00:44:04,778 --> 00:44:09,909
Bender here has identified the femdito
commander as my ex-lover, Turanga Leela,

620
00:44:10,016 --> 00:44:11,449
whom I once made love at.

621
00:44:11,551 --> 00:44:14,452
And he's willing to fink
her out for a few simoleons?

622
00:44:14,554 --> 00:44:17,751
It's not about the money, Nixon,
though I'd like much more.

623
00:44:17,857 --> 00:44:21,451
It's 'cause Leela's a threat.
A threat to my reputation.

624
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,723
She's committed 30 felonies
in 12 star systems.

625
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:28,231
If no one stops her, she'll break
my record for longest rap sheet.

626
00:44:29,601 --> 00:44:32,297
That's a despicable motive,
Bender, and I respect it.

627
00:44:33,706 --> 00:44:37,334
Now, I could find Leela, but
you'll need to authorize a wiretap.

628
00:44:37,442 --> 00:44:39,774
- As many as you like.
- I only need one.

629
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:41,208
Let's call it six.

630
00:44:42,113 --> 00:44:46,413
Question. If you don't know where
Leela is, how can you wiretap her?

631
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:49,281
I'm not wiretapping her,
Greensleeves.

632
00:44:49,387 --> 00:44:53,483
You see, like all women,
Leela has one weakness.

633
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:56,319
Hello, weakness!

634
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:02,997
Hey, Bender, check it out.
I'm Leo Wong's new security guard.

635
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,501
I got an ID badge and a flashlight,
and I ordered this mustache.

636
00:45:06,603 --> 00:45:09,800
Neat. Say, speaking of
whatever the hell you just said,

637
00:45:09,906 --> 00:45:12,340
I need to make a cell
phone telephone call.

638
00:45:12,441 --> 00:45:15,342
Can borrow your
cell phone telephone?

639
00:45:15,578 --> 00:45:17,546
Okay, but don't
restart my Tetris.

640
00:45:17,646 --> 00:45:19,238
I was finally about
to get one of those pieces

641
00:45:19,348 --> 00:45:20,747
that looks like a backwards "L."

642
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:22,181
Okay, superstud.

643
00:45:23,819 --> 00:45:27,516
Looking good, security.
No feministas getting past you.

644
00:45:27,623 --> 00:45:30,023
No, sir. Not on my
mustache's watch.

645
00:45:30,392 --> 00:45:33,657
Fry, I can't believe you're working
with my dad against Leela.

646
00:45:33,762 --> 00:45:36,697
How can you claim to be
her friend and still want her in jail?

647
00:45:37,932 --> 00:45:39,991
It's a tightrope walk,
I won't deny it.

648
00:45:40,101 --> 00:45:43,730
It takes the kind of multi-sided
thinking your dad's so brilliant at.

649
00:45:44,072 --> 00:45:47,473
- You mean being two-faced?
- Don't mind cranky-pants here.

650
00:45:47,575 --> 00:45:50,372
She been cranky ever since
she was a fat little girl.

651
00:45:50,477 --> 00:45:51,466
Dad!

652
00:45:51,578 --> 00:45:55,139
Can I be brutally honest, Fry?
I always wanted a son.

653
00:45:55,249 --> 00:45:56,944
That hurt, but I can take it.

654
00:45:58,886 --> 00:46:00,615
I knew you wanted a son!

655
00:46:00,721 --> 00:46:03,212
Why do you think I became
a miniature golf champion?

656
00:46:03,323 --> 00:46:06,087
Why do you think I wear
these stupid boys' sweat suits?

657
00:46:06,193 --> 00:46:08,990
To hide your
big, fat butt, that's why.

658
00:46:09,095 --> 00:46:12,292
Now, sir, in fairness,
Amy's butt is actually pretty hot.

659
00:46:12,598 --> 00:46:13,656
What is it with you men?

660
00:46:13,766 --> 00:46:15,791
Why does everything
revolve around my butt?

661
00:46:15,902 --> 00:46:18,166
'Cause it's so big and massive.

662
00:46:19,005 --> 00:46:21,303
- Sorry.
- That's it!

663
00:46:22,508 --> 00:46:26,034
Why don't you just adopt Fry and
make him the son you never had?

664
00:46:26,144 --> 00:46:28,806
That'll replace the daughter
you don't have anymore!

665
00:46:30,515 --> 00:46:32,278
Whoa! What's with Big Butt?

666
00:46:32,384 --> 00:46:34,011
She just hungry.

667
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:35,677
- Here you go, Fry.
- Thanks.

668
00:46:35,787 --> 00:46:40,315
Oh! FYI, I dropped that Tetris piece in
the wrong place and ended the game.

669
00:46:42,494 --> 00:46:45,291
No!

670
00:46:51,469 --> 00:46:54,165
Great! Now Amy's gonna
tell Leela I'm a jerk.

671
00:46:54,638 --> 00:46:58,005
If only I could explain
I'm on a secret mission against evil.

672
00:46:58,175 --> 00:47:00,405
Wait. Evil? Yeah, yeah, evil.

673
00:47:02,011 --> 00:47:05,447
What's going on in there?
A scary noise?

674
00:47:07,951 --> 00:47:10,181
Hey, you're one of
Leela's feministas.

675
00:47:11,221 --> 00:47:15,123
"Save the environment!
Wo-mandate Leo's retirement!"

676
00:47:15,391 --> 00:47:20,191
That's terrible writing!
Stop making your point so ineffectively!

677
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:22,160
Take your mands off of me!

678
00:47:23,398 --> 00:47:24,695
I'm on your side.

679
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,631
Don't shush me.

680
00:47:26,735 --> 00:47:29,067
Please, can you take
a message to Leela?

681
00:47:29,905 --> 00:47:31,031
What is it?

682
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:35,473
Just say her sweet goofbag is working to
save the violet dwarf star, just like she is.

683
00:47:35,611 --> 00:47:38,272
Very well,
I'll fem-municate your man-formation.

684
00:47:38,446 --> 00:47:39,538
Just tell her.

685
00:47:42,416 --> 00:47:46,876
Well, this is it, old friends.
Planet Express is done for,

686
00:47:46,988 --> 00:47:48,922
what with our
delivery crew missing

687
00:47:49,023 --> 00:47:51,548
and the abysmal sales
of Tickle Me Bender.

688
00:47:53,194 --> 00:47:55,093
<i>Quit touching my junk, pervert!</i>

689
00:47:56,396 --> 00:47:59,559
Hold out your hands
and I'll remove your career chips.

690
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,625
I hate to see it come to an end.

691
00:48:04,504 --> 00:48:05,971
When will it end?

692
00:48:08,742 --> 00:48:10,801
Shouldn't you get that, Professor?

693
00:48:12,045 --> 00:48:13,375
I suppose.

694
00:48:16,849 --> 00:48:17,975
Hello?

695
00:48:18,083 --> 00:48:19,948
<i>Professor, old buddy,</i>

696
00:48:20,052 --> 00:48:22,350
<i>I'm gonna blow up
the violet dwarf star.</i>

697
00:48:22,454 --> 00:48:25,617
<i>So I need you deliver
billion-mile security fence</i>

698
00:48:25,724 --> 00:48:29,216
<i>to keep out protesters.
Dirty business. Lot of money.</i>

699
00:48:29,328 --> 00:48:30,317
<i>You corrupt enough?</i>

700
00:48:30,429 --> 00:48:31,622
Damn skippy!

701
00:48:34,198 --> 00:48:38,032
Good news, crybabies!
We're back in business.

702
00:49:06,463 --> 00:49:10,796
Sweet kookaburra of Edinburgh, Professor.
You sure you know how to fly this thing?

703
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:13,960
I invented it, didn't I?
You wouldn't ask Thomas Edison

704
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:16,334
whether he knew
how to use a sexmatron.

705
00:49:18,708 --> 00:49:20,403
The feministas, probably.

706
00:49:26,281 --> 00:49:29,444
<i>Halt! What are you doing
in this parallelogram of space?</i>

707
00:49:29,551 --> 00:49:33,009
We're delivering a fence to
keep you ladies in your place.

708
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:39,820
- Amy?
- Labarbara?

709
00:49:39,928 --> 00:49:41,452
That's right, husband.

710
00:49:41,563 --> 00:49:44,190
From now on, you make
your own Manwiches.

711
00:49:44,298 --> 00:49:48,701
Under the articles of the confemiracy,
we hereby wo-mandeer this ship.

712
00:49:48,802 --> 00:49:51,430
Oh, no, you don't.
It's three against three.

713
00:49:58,479 --> 00:50:02,414
That was the greatest play I ever saw.
It must have had 20 acts.

714
00:50:11,791 --> 00:50:14,453
<i>We installed your fence, Leo Wong.</i>

715
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,391
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

716
00:50:16,496 --> 00:50:18,054
Should we shout a clever slogan?

717
00:50:18,164 --> 00:50:21,496
You mean something like,
"The best defense is a good fence?"

718
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,625
Yeah, something
like that, only funny.

719
00:50:23,735 --> 00:50:24,827
I wish we could,

720
00:50:24,936 --> 00:50:28,167
but our chief slogan writer is
back at the Honeybun Hideout.

721
00:50:32,377 --> 00:50:35,869
Does "violet dwarf" rhyme
with "men are dorks"?

722
00:50:36,348 --> 00:50:38,144
It does through a megaphone.

723
00:50:38,649 --> 00:50:41,584
<i>That reminds me, I've got to
tell Leela about that weirdo</i>

724
00:50:41,686 --> 00:50:43,654
<i>who wants to save
the violet dwarf.</i>

725
00:50:43,754 --> 00:50:47,383
<i>So, the Legion
of Madfellows has a new pawn, eh?</i>

726
00:50:48,626 --> 00:50:50,116
Is somebody here?

727
00:50:50,561 --> 00:50:52,791
If you're the DSL guy,
you're two days late.

728
00:50:52,897 --> 00:50:54,694
Who gave you that message for Leela?

729
00:50:54,799 --> 00:50:56,060
I don't know his name.

730
00:50:56,166 --> 00:50:58,600
Then you are of no use to the Dark Ones!

731
00:51:02,205 --> 00:51:05,971
Long lost brother, avenge my death.

732
00:51:09,746 --> 00:51:13,079
Where are your crappy
rhymes now, Frida Waterfall?

733
00:51:13,183 --> 00:51:15,810
I'm dead. I'm dead.

734
00:51:15,918 --> 00:51:18,785
<i>Eat only natural whole-grain bread.</i>

735
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:30,325
<i>Six, seven, eight
Lock the gate</i>

736
00:51:30,432 --> 00:51:33,332
<i>One, two, three
Turn the key</i>

737
00:51:33,434 --> 00:51:34,560
<i>30, 50, 10</i>

738
00:51:34,669 --> 00:51:38,332
- My dirty, shifty friend?
- Hey, Fry, long time.

739
00:51:45,947 --> 00:51:48,939
Welcome back to the
Legion of Madfellows, man.

740
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:51,377
Why'd you bonk me, you idiot?

741
00:51:51,485 --> 00:51:53,248
You could have just
asked me to come with you.

742
00:51:53,353 --> 00:51:56,413
And where are we? This doesn't
look like your regular dumpster.

743
00:51:56,523 --> 00:51:58,514
All in good time!

744
00:51:59,493 --> 00:52:00,892
I guess now is a good time.

745
00:52:00,994 --> 00:52:03,155
We are on Mars,
in a forgotten cavern

746
00:52:03,263 --> 00:52:07,131
abandoned by the native
Martians a million years ago.

747
00:52:07,399 --> 00:52:11,165
Actually, it was five years ago.
I remember 'cause they washed my socks.

748
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:12,965
You have done well, Fry.

749
00:52:13,072 --> 00:52:15,768
You have ingratiated
yourself with Leo Wong.

750
00:52:15,875 --> 00:52:18,708
Yup, I kissed his ass
from cheek to shining cheek.

751
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:20,106
So, what do I do next?

752
00:52:20,212 --> 00:52:21,804
As Wong security chief,

753
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:25,381
you will be on hand when
he attempts to destroy the violet dwarf.

754
00:52:25,483 --> 00:52:27,610
You must not let that happen.

755
00:52:27,719 --> 00:52:30,153
"Must let happen. "

756
00:52:30,255 --> 00:52:31,847
Not happen!

757
00:52:31,956 --> 00:52:35,289
"Must let occur. "

758
00:52:35,393 --> 00:52:40,092
Let me tell you a story.
A story of two alien species

759
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:45,396
so ancient that compared to them
the human race is a mere college senior!

760
00:52:47,871 --> 00:52:52,501
On a distant planetoid they evolved
to cooperate in their quest to survive.

761
00:52:57,614 --> 00:53:00,674
Cooperation, because
life is a team sport.

762
00:53:01,118 --> 00:53:05,383
But, over time,
one species evolved a better strategy,

763
00:53:05,788 --> 00:53:09,918
and an evolutionary arms race began.

764
00:53:28,944 --> 00:53:33,074
That concludes the audio-visual
portion of our head-clonk and lecture.

765
00:53:33,348 --> 00:53:35,748
Wait, what happened
to the snakes and the frogs?

766
00:53:35,851 --> 00:53:37,148
I need to know!

767
00:53:39,353 --> 00:53:44,950
The frogs, or possibly the snakes,
evolved into vicious killing machines,

768
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:49,553
honed by the merciless forces of
natural selection and intelligent design.

769
00:53:49,864 --> 00:53:53,027
We call these the Dark Ones!

770
00:53:55,002 --> 00:54:00,701
These evil creatures preyed on all life,
driving species after species to extinction.

771
00:54:01,074 --> 00:54:02,507
Meanwhile, however,

772
00:54:02,609 --> 00:54:05,601
the second species evolved
to fend off the Dark Ones,

773
00:54:05,812 --> 00:54:08,804
befriending and protecting
all other living things.

774
00:54:09,148 --> 00:54:11,616
- Even Celine Dion?
- Probably.

775
00:54:11,718 --> 00:54:15,278
We call these noble
beings the Encyclopods,

776
00:54:15,487 --> 00:54:17,318
because their DNA incorporates

777
00:54:17,422 --> 00:54:20,914
the DNA of every endangered
species they encountered,

778
00:54:21,026 --> 00:54:24,325
so they can recreate
them if they go extinct.

779
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:29,966
Just as a pillow, a wig and a corncob pipe
can be used to recreate my old girlfriend!

780
00:54:30,369 --> 00:54:31,358
Bingo.

781
00:54:33,104 --> 00:54:35,595
<i>Meanwhile, at the Honeybun Hideout.</i>

782
00:54:41,412 --> 00:54:45,314
There! Now you know how it feels
to be locked up in a go-go cage.

783
00:54:45,549 --> 00:54:47,176
What the hell are you talking about?

784
00:54:47,285 --> 00:54:48,718
Shut your man-hole.

785
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:55,051
I feel dirty.

786
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:57,551
Are you sure Fry is
working for your father?

787
00:54:57,661 --> 00:55:01,153
It just doesn't seem like him to
be so evil, or to hold down a job.

788
00:55:01,264 --> 00:55:04,825
It's true, Leela.
Cross My Heart bra and swear to Goddess.

789
00:55:04,935 --> 00:55:07,426
But the Fry I know
wouldn't do that.

790
00:55:07,537 --> 00:55:10,869
I'm gonna call his cell phone
telephone and prove you wrong.

791
00:55:15,411 --> 00:55:17,936
Oh, no! Frida's been murdered!

792
00:55:20,282 --> 00:55:22,546
Sweet she-cattle of Seattle.

793
00:55:22,651 --> 00:55:24,516
Not your
strong suit, woman.

794
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:26,052
Who could have done this?

795
00:55:26,154 --> 00:55:27,746
Your dad? Nixon?

796
00:55:28,256 --> 00:55:29,280
Fry?

797
00:55:29,390 --> 00:55:31,790
No, never. I don't think.

798
00:55:31,893 --> 00:55:34,418
Anyhow, there's a crazed
murderer on the loose,

799
00:55:34,529 --> 00:55:36,929
possibly in the shadows
or hanging from the ceiling.

800
00:55:38,132 --> 00:55:39,997
So just stay calm while I call Fry.

801
00:55:44,004 --> 00:55:47,440
So where are the Encyclopods
and the Dark Ones now?

802
00:55:50,043 --> 00:55:52,511
When the life-giving
Chee receded,

803
00:55:52,612 --> 00:55:56,048
only the toughest organisms
could adapt and survive,

804
00:55:56,149 --> 00:55:57,582
like the Dark Ones.

805
00:56:00,954 --> 00:56:04,252
Many more died out,
like the Encyclopods.

806
00:56:04,357 --> 00:56:08,088
But, and this is the
great secret of our age,

807
00:56:08,194 --> 00:56:12,062
we believe they
left an egg behind.

808
00:56:12,365 --> 00:56:14,526
- Is it edible?
- We're not gonna eat it!

809
00:56:14,633 --> 00:56:19,366
Not unless we find a second one.
No, Fry, we intend to hatch it!

810
00:56:19,572 --> 00:56:21,402
And that's where you come in.

811
00:56:21,506 --> 00:56:22,973
And here I am.

812
00:56:23,074 --> 00:56:26,202
At long last the tide
of Chee has returned,

813
00:56:26,311 --> 00:56:29,712
and its nourishing flow
has awakened the dormant egg.

814
00:56:29,914 --> 00:56:30,881
That's good.

815
00:56:30,982 --> 00:56:35,510
It's better than good. It's better.
With its massive stash of DNA,

816
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:40,647
the Encyclopod can reconstruct
every species that ever went extinct.

817
00:56:40,758 --> 00:56:45,991
Imagine, all the animals that
failed evolution's test, alive again!

818
00:56:46,096 --> 00:56:50,430
The dodo bird, the brittle-klutz,
the striped biologist-taunter.

819
00:56:50,534 --> 00:56:55,062
- So, where is this egg?
- In the violet dwarf star system.

820
00:56:55,172 --> 00:56:58,572
- And what does it look like?
- A violet dwarf star!

821
00:56:58,674 --> 00:57:02,872
You mean, the whole star
is a single... Whoa! Sci-fi.

822
00:57:03,179 --> 00:57:08,515
Alas! Even now, a Dark One is headed
to the star to ensure its destruction.

823
00:57:08,618 --> 00:57:11,052
Dang! So what does
this Dark One look like?

824
00:57:12,255 --> 00:57:16,520
We don't know. I admit
it's a horrifically grave situation.

825
00:57:16,625 --> 00:57:18,217
Don't sugarcoat it, Nine.

826
00:57:18,326 --> 00:57:20,191
The Dark Ones have
been evolving so long,

827
00:57:20,295 --> 00:57:22,160
it could be anything or anyone.

828
00:57:22,264 --> 00:57:23,424
Or anybody.

829
00:57:23,532 --> 00:57:24,863
You mean, like, people?

830
00:57:24,966 --> 00:57:27,230
Any people. It will kill the egg,

831
00:57:27,335 --> 00:57:30,168
and every dude, woman
and child who knows about it.

832
00:57:30,272 --> 00:57:33,638
Even our crazy caps will
be useless at close range.

833
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:38,174
That's why only you, with your
defective unreadable brainwave,

834
00:57:38,279 --> 00:57:39,746
may be able to thwart them

835
00:57:39,847 --> 00:57:43,146
and usher in a new
green age of wonder and...

836
00:57:45,719 --> 00:57:48,279
You're on Fry-time. Leela!

837
00:57:48,689 --> 00:57:51,156
- Did you get my message?
- What message?

838
00:57:51,257 --> 00:57:52,849
<i>Didn't you see Frida Waterfall?</i>

839
00:57:52,959 --> 00:57:55,484
So you did
kill Frida Waterfall?

840
00:57:55,695 --> 00:57:58,186
What? No. I told her
to tell you that I'm...

841
00:57:58,565 --> 00:58:01,932
Oh, Jeep! The Dark Ones
got her. It's all true.

842
00:58:02,335 --> 00:58:04,860
We need to talk, Leela.
Then I can explain...

843
00:58:05,038 --> 00:58:07,666
Well, I can't explain anything,
but we should talk anyway.

844
00:58:07,774 --> 00:58:09,900
- Where are you?
- Oh, no.

845
00:58:10,008 --> 00:58:12,306
I'm not gonna expose
the Honeybun Hideout.

846
00:58:12,411 --> 00:58:13,503
Where are you?

847
00:58:13,612 --> 00:58:17,173
Near the Keeler Crater on Mars.
Do you know it?

848
00:58:17,282 --> 00:58:19,716
I think I read about it.

849
00:58:20,419 --> 00:58:23,684
<i>I'll meet you at the south
rim in one hour. No mustaches.</i>

850
00:58:27,692 --> 00:58:31,958
Kif, set coordinates, 36-24-36.

851
00:58:32,330 --> 00:58:35,197
AKA, Leela.

852
00:58:43,074 --> 00:58:46,770
Ten minutes late.
Ain't that just like a womanista?

853
00:58:47,511 --> 00:58:50,639
- Are you alone?
- Of course, don't you trust me?

854
00:58:54,751 --> 00:58:56,514
<i>There's no escape, Leela.</i>

855
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:59,145
<i>If you surrender,
wave your shirt in the air.</i>

856
00:58:59,322 --> 00:59:00,653
Fry, you traitor!

857
00:59:02,325 --> 00:59:04,451
<i>Hop onto
the magnet, Leela!</i>

858
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,391
Okay. One, two...

859
00:59:20,342 --> 00:59:22,277
I can't believe you
ratted me out, Fry.

860
00:59:22,544 --> 00:59:24,034
I'm not a rat, I swear.

861
00:59:24,145 --> 00:59:28,047
If I'm any rodent, it's the loyal
capybara, king of the rats! No, wait.

862
00:59:31,519 --> 00:59:34,249
This just in, we are about
to get our asses blown off.

863
00:59:34,355 --> 00:59:36,880
- Labarbara?
- That's right, Linda.

864
00:59:38,759 --> 00:59:42,217
Stay strong, ladies. We can lose them
in the giant miniature golf course.

865
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:45,196
But the course isn't finished.
And there's no girls allowed.

866
00:59:45,299 --> 00:59:46,493
Fore!

867
00:59:52,706 --> 00:59:57,574
So, they want to play mini golf, eh?
Two can play at that game.

868
00:59:57,710 --> 01:00:00,702
Or even four, depending on
the number of ball colors available.

869
01:00:02,048 --> 01:00:05,643
- I choose pink.
- That's their color, sir.

870
01:00:05,751 --> 01:00:06,911
The hell it is.

871
01:00:19,431 --> 01:00:22,696
They're gaining on us.
We need a birdie on the windmill hole.

872
01:00:24,669 --> 01:00:26,330
Wait. Wait.

873
01:00:27,706 --> 01:00:29,003
Drop the boot!

874
01:00:33,911 --> 01:00:35,037
Sir, at our present speed,

875
01:00:35,145 --> 01:00:38,808
the computer predicts
a 100% chance we'll be sliced in half.

876
01:00:38,916 --> 01:00:39,940
We'll never make it.

877
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:43,747
Not with that attitude, we won't.
Same speed ahead!

878
01:00:52,662 --> 01:00:55,426
We made it through, Kif.
How many men did we lose?

879
01:00:55,531 --> 01:00:56,498
All of them.

880
01:00:56,599 --> 01:00:58,965
Well, at least they won't
have to mourn each other.

881
01:00:59,068 --> 01:01:02,196
Seal the airlocks,
and draw the shades.

882
01:01:03,239 --> 01:01:04,570
Resume shooting.

883
01:01:12,547 --> 01:01:15,345
Oh, no! The gorilla! That's a par-four!

884
01:01:16,618 --> 01:01:19,314
The mouth's too dangerous.
I'm going for the nose.

885
01:01:19,421 --> 01:01:22,481
Don't be a sucker. You won't
come out anywhere near the hole.

886
01:01:22,591 --> 01:01:25,822
You need to aim for the jaws
just when they start to close.

887
01:01:25,927 --> 01:01:28,394
Start to close?
Are you out of your...

888
01:01:37,405 --> 01:01:38,770
We made it!

889
01:01:41,976 --> 01:01:45,138
Captaining 101. Go for the nose.

890
01:01:50,717 --> 01:01:53,845
My arms are broken,
I'll never paint again.

891
01:01:55,355 --> 01:01:57,380
You can't sue the military.

892
01:01:57,490 --> 01:01:59,048
I'm okay then.

893
01:01:59,492 --> 01:02:00,516
Damage report.

894
01:02:00,627 --> 01:02:03,322
We lost all remaining
food and oxygen, Captain.

895
01:02:03,429 --> 01:02:05,556
As well as our XM Radio antenna.

896
01:02:05,664 --> 01:02:07,097
Then this chase is over.

897
01:02:07,199 --> 01:02:10,532
Kif, set course
for the nearest XM repair facility.

898
01:02:10,636 --> 01:02:13,537
Meanwhile, we shall
sing top hits from the '80s.

899
01:02:13,639 --> 01:02:15,334
Which '80s, sir?

900
01:02:15,441 --> 01:02:17,773
For me, there are only one '80s.

901
01:02:19,345 --> 01:02:22,245
<i>Smell like I sound
I'm lost and I'm found</i>

902
01:02:23,548 --> 01:02:27,712
<i>And I'm hungry like the wolf</i>

903
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:39,320
The shot was too good!
We're jamming straight for the hole.

904
01:02:39,429 --> 01:02:41,260
We're gonna crash, even.

905
01:02:41,365 --> 01:02:45,927
Shmeesh, shmill out,
shmeverybody. It's a wormhole hole.

906
01:02:46,403 --> 01:02:51,841
Of course, a wormhole!
We'll simply disappear and reappear in

907
01:02:54,244 --> 01:02:56,007
another part of the universe.

908
01:02:56,113 --> 01:02:57,204
We made it!

909
01:03:03,018 --> 01:03:06,419
<i>Crud nuggets!
We de-spaced right next to the Nimbus.</i>

910
01:03:06,522 --> 01:03:10,219
Just when you think the chase
is over, it gets twice as exciting!

911
01:03:19,734 --> 01:03:21,258
Hey, look at that.

912
01:03:21,369 --> 01:03:22,996
Well, well, well.

913
01:03:23,371 --> 01:03:26,135
My bloodhound-like instincts
must have hunted them down

914
01:03:26,241 --> 01:03:29,677
while my other parts
were throbbing to Duran Duran.

915
01:03:29,978 --> 01:03:33,640
Shall I initiate a pointless
and potentially fatal pursuit?

916
01:03:33,781 --> 01:03:34,770
Make it so.

917
01:03:34,882 --> 01:03:37,646
It's gonna be fun on a bun, in space.

918
01:03:50,497 --> 01:03:54,489
Look! The asteroid.
Now it's crawling with life.

919
01:03:54,867 --> 01:03:56,562
Like Zoidberg's sandals!

920
01:03:56,903 --> 01:03:59,997
Wow! It's incredible.

921
01:04:00,206 --> 01:04:03,733
But it'll be destroyed when
Leo Wong blows up the violet dwarf.

922
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:07,639
- So why are you helping him?
- I can't tell you, Leela.

923
01:04:08,047 --> 01:04:09,206
You just have to trust me.

924
01:04:09,314 --> 01:04:10,747
You keep saying that,

925
01:04:10,849 --> 01:04:12,476
but you have to give me
something to go on or I...

926
01:04:13,718 --> 01:04:16,949
<i>Out of whale oil. Out of whale oil.</i>

927
01:04:17,055 --> 01:04:19,853
The out-of-fuel indicator. It's indicating.

928
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:26,723
Say, what's that violet-colored
dwarf-like star thing we're drifting into?

929
01:04:26,832 --> 01:04:28,389
The violet dwarf star!

930
01:04:30,301 --> 01:04:35,295
Of course. The gorilla was the 18th hole,
so we're headed into the ball return.

931
01:04:36,106 --> 01:04:37,869
What else now can go wrong?

932
01:04:42,313 --> 01:04:47,340
<i>Ladies, you're under arrest.
Prepare to be boarded again and again.</i>

933
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:50,047
He'll never take me alive.

934
01:04:53,223 --> 01:04:56,784
Don't give up yet.
I've got one more trick up my sleeve.

935
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:58,952
That's exactly the number we need.

936
01:05:03,765 --> 01:05:05,289
The fairer sex.

937
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:12,129
Something's very wrong here,
and yet a little bit right.

938
01:05:13,308 --> 01:05:15,333
Not so fast, Brannigan.

939
01:05:16,411 --> 01:05:19,039
Even less fast, feministas!

940
01:05:20,916 --> 01:05:21,904
Bender?

941
01:05:22,016 --> 01:05:23,381
All two tons of me.

942
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:28,354
Oye, oye, oye.

943
01:05:28,456 --> 01:05:33,484
All rise for the honorable Chief Justice
D- O-G-G and the Associate Justices.

944
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:41,158
Yo. Seat it or beat it.

945
01:05:42,802 --> 01:05:45,828
The charges against
y'all femditos is murder,

946
01:05:45,939 --> 01:05:50,239
mayhem, vandalism,
kidnapping and resisting arrest.

947
01:05:50,477 --> 01:05:52,468
Damn! The big five.

948
01:05:52,746 --> 01:05:55,909
You may now make your opening.
What you got to say for yourselves?

949
01:05:56,016 --> 01:05:58,006
May it please the Court...

950
01:05:58,117 --> 01:06:00,244
I mean, may it plizzle the cozizzle.

951
01:06:00,486 --> 01:06:03,148
- Proceed.
- These charges are outrageous.

952
01:06:03,255 --> 01:06:07,658
Our only goal was to save a rare
violet star and its precious ecosystem.

953
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,853
If protecting the environment is a crime,
then...

954
01:06:09,962 --> 01:06:12,192
Protecting the environment is a crime.

955
01:06:12,565 --> 01:06:14,760
I rest my mouth.

956
01:06:14,867 --> 01:06:17,562
Do you swear to tell the whole
truth and nothing but the truth?

957
01:06:17,669 --> 01:06:21,799
I... Well, now, I... Am I under
oath when I take the oath?

958
01:06:22,206 --> 01:06:25,107
Can the witness identify
the feminista leader?

959
01:06:25,209 --> 01:06:26,437
That's her right there,

960
01:06:26,544 --> 01:06:29,172
with the "I'm gonna kill
you Bender" look in her eye.

961
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:33,011
Hey, aren't you the robot who
robbed me at gunpoint last year?

962
01:06:33,284 --> 01:06:35,183
No further answers, Your Honor.

963
01:06:35,786 --> 01:06:38,949
Please, Justice Dogg, Leela and
her friends are completely innocent.

964
01:06:39,056 --> 01:06:42,423
Hold up. Were you or were
you not abducted by these hoes?

965
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:46,193
Well, abducted is such an ugly word.

966
01:06:46,597 --> 01:06:50,624
Mr. Wong, the court cannot compel you
to testify against your own daughter.

967
01:06:50,834 --> 01:06:54,792
No. No, I want to. Also, I got
something to say about my wife.

968
01:06:55,304 --> 01:06:56,271
Aw, yeah.

969
01:06:58,941 --> 01:07:02,308
Having heard some of the testimony
over these jams I've been listening to,

970
01:07:02,411 --> 01:07:05,073
me and my crew will
now kick it in the mix.

971
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:31,301
All right. We got us
a verdict up in this High Court.

972
01:07:31,772 --> 01:07:34,400
Bailiff, drop it like
it's legal precedent.

973
01:07:34,675 --> 01:07:38,736
<i>In the matter of Leo Wong v.
The Greenorita Eco-Feminist Collective,</i>

974
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:42,007
four justices vote to convict,
five to acquit.

975
01:07:43,584 --> 01:07:46,279
However, since the vote was
strictly along gender lines

976
01:07:46,386 --> 01:07:50,914
and the female justices' votes only
count half, you are hereby found guilty.

977
01:07:52,525 --> 01:07:56,222
It's a humiliating and biased system,
but it works.

978
01:07:56,663 --> 01:07:59,826
Fifty years in the maximum
security Dogg house.

979
01:08:01,167 --> 01:08:02,134
Peace.

980
01:08:11,443 --> 01:08:17,143
- Ladies! Welcome to hell.
- Beats Nutley on a Saturday night.

981
01:08:17,249 --> 01:08:23,312
This is a privately-owned for-profit prison,
and I run a tight, cheap ship!

982
01:08:23,421 --> 01:08:28,051
I've done this by cutting cost everywhere,
especially on punishment.

983
01:08:28,159 --> 01:08:32,823
I rely on you inmates to make
prison unpleasant for yourselves.

984
01:08:32,930 --> 01:08:35,330
You're encouraged to
sexually harass new prisoners,

985
01:08:35,433 --> 01:08:39,926
organize no-holds-barred
catfights and maintain poor hygiene.

986
01:08:40,036 --> 01:08:42,129
Try and make me, copper.

987
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:44,138
A troublemaker.

988
01:08:45,408 --> 01:08:48,138
Taste the lash of my
99-cent-store nightstick!

989
01:08:51,648 --> 01:08:52,876
Yee-ha!

990
01:08:52,982 --> 01:08:56,213
With the feministas in
jail, it full speed ahead.

991
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:00,446
You and me, Fry. We implode
the violet dwarf star tomorrow.

992
01:09:00,556 --> 01:09:01,580
Ka-boom-boom.

993
01:09:01,690 --> 01:09:03,157
- You and me?
- Yeah.

994
01:09:03,258 --> 01:09:04,748
- Tomorrow?
- Tomorrow.

995
01:09:04,860 --> 01:09:06,953
- Ka-boom?
- Ka-boom-boom.

996
01:09:15,137 --> 01:09:18,268
Hello? Madfellows? I need to...

997
01:09:20,908 --> 01:09:23,877
Okay, Leo Wong's about to
destroy the violet dwarf.

998
01:09:23,978 --> 01:09:26,469
So, whatever I need to know
to stop him, tell me now.

999
01:09:26,581 --> 01:09:29,414
Alas! Stopping Wong
isn't the only problem.

1000
01:09:29,517 --> 01:09:32,543
One of the Dark Ones will try to
stop you from stopping him.

1001
01:09:32,653 --> 01:09:35,621
So, you must stop it from
stopping you from stopping him.

1002
01:09:35,722 --> 01:09:37,622
But how can I stop
it stop me stop him?

1003
01:09:37,724 --> 01:09:41,353
Stop it! Behold,
the Omega Device.

1004
01:09:44,564 --> 01:09:45,531
That's it?

1005
01:09:45,632 --> 01:09:49,124
The name "Omega Device" sort of
conjured up something cooler-looking.

1006
01:09:49,236 --> 01:09:51,261
Not that I'm disappointed or anything.

1007
01:09:51,371 --> 01:09:54,271
The important thing is what's inside.

1008
01:09:54,373 --> 01:09:57,103
- What does that look like?
- No one knows, man.

1009
01:09:57,209 --> 01:09:59,006
It was invented
by a blind inventor,

1010
01:09:59,111 --> 01:10:01,944
and the one dude he
described it to was deaf.

1011
01:10:02,047 --> 01:10:03,981
So the legend goes.

1012
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:09,084
When activated, the device will emit
a localized blast of delta-band noise

1013
01:10:09,188 --> 01:10:11,712
to momentarily
disable the Dark One.

1014
01:10:11,823 --> 01:10:14,087
- Like farting in a tent?
- No, an elevator.

1015
01:10:14,192 --> 01:10:17,821
Which is why you must
strike the enemy at point blank range!

1016
01:10:19,330 --> 01:10:21,992
But the Dark One could
look like anything or anyone, right?

1017
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:23,590
Or anywhere.

1018
01:10:23,868 --> 01:10:25,699
So, what's your plan to recognize it?

1019
01:10:25,804 --> 01:10:27,431
- We don't have one.
- Got it.

1020
01:10:27,539 --> 01:10:29,733
And we don't dare
think of one neither.

1021
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:33,537
'Cause if we do, the Dark Ones
might sense kind of the general vibe.

1022
01:10:33,777 --> 01:10:36,109
Even through our mighty foil.

1023
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:39,838
Oh, man!
Anyone got some tape or some gum?

1024
01:10:39,983 --> 01:10:44,181
As my colleague indicated,
the plan cannot come from us, Fry.

1025
01:10:44,288 --> 01:10:45,687
We were counting on you

1026
01:10:45,789 --> 01:10:48,416
and your unreadable brain
to come up with something.

1027
01:10:48,524 --> 01:10:50,856
- That was a mistake.
- I see that now.

1028
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:56,125
Freaky thing is, the Dark Ones'
thoughts are unreadable, just like yours.

1029
01:10:56,232 --> 01:10:58,996
Yes, if we dared unwrap our heads,

1030
01:10:59,101 --> 01:11:04,367
we could easily locate the one other being
whose mind we can't read. The Dark One!

1031
01:11:04,506 --> 01:11:06,804
But then the Dark One
would read our minds

1032
01:11:06,908 --> 01:11:09,240
and crush them
like blood pumpkins.

1033
01:11:09,344 --> 01:11:12,780
Wait. I can read minds
and my mind can't be read.

1034
01:11:13,114 --> 01:11:14,911
- I have a plan.
- Great.

1035
01:11:15,016 --> 01:11:16,711
Whatever it is, don't tell us.

1036
01:11:16,818 --> 01:11:20,914
Wait. Fry can read minds
and his mind can't be read.

1037
01:11:21,122 --> 01:11:23,783
So he can safely
scan for the Dark One...

1038
01:11:23,891 --> 01:11:25,290
Shut up! Shut up!

1039
01:11:37,671 --> 01:11:42,573
<i>Leela, time is running out.
We must get to the violet star.</i>

1040
01:11:42,675 --> 01:11:44,609
Okay, okay. Shut up, already.

1041
01:11:44,744 --> 01:11:45,938
Huh?

1042
01:11:46,045 --> 01:11:47,569
Nobody's talking, Leela.

1043
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:50,513
We're just painting each other's
toenails with rat blood.

1044
01:11:50,617 --> 01:11:52,084
Lights out, ladies!

1045
01:11:52,185 --> 01:11:55,018
Those compact fluorescent
bulbs waste pennies a day.

1046
01:11:58,757 --> 01:12:00,657
Okay, feministas, all clear.

1047
01:12:00,759 --> 01:12:02,351
Whoa!

1048
01:12:02,461 --> 01:12:05,362
We now go live to Leela
with the escape plan.

1049
01:12:05,464 --> 01:12:06,795
- Leela?
- Thanks, Linda.

1050
01:12:06,899 --> 01:12:10,096
Now we're in here because we
tried to save endangered wildlife.

1051
01:12:10,202 --> 01:12:13,433
So this time,
endangered wildlife will save us.

1052
01:12:14,873 --> 01:12:16,806
The Martian muck leech.

1053
01:12:16,908 --> 01:12:20,344
That's right. He's been living
off me since we got captured.

1054
01:12:21,545 --> 01:12:23,945
Little cutie almost sucked me dry.

1055
01:12:32,256 --> 01:12:33,951
Look at him go.

1056
01:12:34,058 --> 01:12:37,424
Like a green snake
through a sugarcane cake.

1057
01:12:37,527 --> 01:12:39,586
<i>Keep trying.</i>

1058
01:12:48,038 --> 01:12:53,202
Our top story. The universe's most wanted
eco-feminists are now behind bars,

1059
01:12:53,309 --> 01:12:58,246
including gang leader, Turanga Leela.
AKA, the Notorious B-I-Itch.

1060
01:12:59,748 --> 01:13:02,808
We finished un-pinking
the ship, Hubert. Now what?

1061
01:13:02,918 --> 01:13:04,442
Now we get back to work.

1062
01:13:04,553 --> 01:13:07,954
And if that means destroying
an ecosystem or two, so be it.

1063
01:13:08,223 --> 01:13:12,283
I just meant without our good
friends Fry, Leela, Amy and the robot.

1064
01:13:12,393 --> 01:13:16,989
Oh, boo-hoo. This is a business,
not a social club. Money talks.

1065
01:13:17,565 --> 01:13:20,329
<i>True wealth is
measured in friendships.</i>

1066
01:13:20,435 --> 01:13:21,732
Shut up, you.

1067
01:13:21,836 --> 01:13:23,531
Life goes on.

1068
01:13:23,638 --> 01:13:27,335
But I believe we'll forever
carry the pain on the inside.

1069
01:13:34,481 --> 01:13:38,815
Oh, no, a rooster!
That indicates it's the following morning.

1070
01:13:40,887 --> 01:13:43,481
How's that creepy crawler doing?

1071
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:46,990
I'm sorry, femi-sisters,
but it pooped out around 3:00 a. m.

1072
01:13:47,093 --> 01:13:49,357
Poor thing couldn't take another bite.

1073
01:13:51,297 --> 01:13:53,094
Well, I guess we failed.

1074
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:56,760
But what matters is, we tried our
best and we looked good doing it.

1075
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:03,733
Bender, is that you?

1076
01:14:03,843 --> 01:14:06,640
Who does it look like?
My identical cousin Buster?

1077
01:14:06,745 --> 01:14:07,769
Yes.

1078
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:13,280
You're here to break us out?
But you're the one who put us in.

1079
01:14:13,385 --> 01:14:16,445
But I'm Bender,
king of the combination shot.

1080
01:14:16,554 --> 01:14:21,582
I put you in so that by busting you out,
I could commit 15 felonies at once.

1081
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:25,957
Put my rap sheet miles ahead
of yours on the all-time chart.

1082
01:14:26,130 --> 01:14:28,462
You are one devious bastard.

1083
01:14:28,565 --> 01:14:31,033
That's what it says on my vanity plate.

1084
01:14:38,642 --> 01:14:41,576
- What about the sentries?
- Already taken care of.

1085
01:14:41,711 --> 01:14:45,613
I sent them a cake laced with nutmeg.
That's a human sleeping drug, right?

1086
01:14:45,715 --> 01:14:48,377
No, it's a human baking drug.

1087
01:14:49,819 --> 01:14:53,846
Okay, Plan B. Everyone knows
men have one fatal weakness,

1088
01:14:53,956 --> 01:14:57,915
they can't resist hookers.
Dixie, Trixie, you know what to do.

1089
01:15:05,934 --> 01:15:07,697
Hello, boys!

1090
01:15:10,105 --> 01:15:13,370
Your eyes say no,
but your machine gun fire says...

1091
01:15:35,128 --> 01:15:37,528
Ladies and gentleman
and whatever,

1092
01:15:37,630 --> 01:15:41,623
welcome to my most environmentally
disastrous implosion ever.

1093
01:15:41,868 --> 01:15:43,733
A whole star system!

1094
01:15:47,173 --> 01:15:50,939
Kif, old boy, mind if I sit on
your shoulders for a better view?

1095
01:15:51,044 --> 01:15:53,841
Well, actually, sir, I was hoping...

1096
01:15:53,946 --> 01:15:55,038
Thanks.

1097
01:15:56,348 --> 01:16:01,877
My associate Philip Fry here will have
honor to blow this ugly, dirty star

1098
01:16:01,987 --> 01:16:03,887
into nice, clean black hole.

1099
01:16:07,926 --> 01:16:11,986
Fry, careful those wires.
What you doing down there?

1100
01:16:12,096 --> 01:16:14,997
Just polishing your shoes, Mr. W.

1101
01:16:17,935 --> 01:16:21,462
That nice. Get between
the toes there, very dirty.

1102
01:16:26,477 --> 01:16:28,672
Well, so much for Plan B.

1103
01:16:28,779 --> 01:16:29,870
What's Plan C?

1104
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:33,973
All situations have the same Plan C.
Bending, come on.

1105
01:16:42,359 --> 01:16:45,260
We're boned, Bender.
It's a brick wall.

1106
01:16:45,362 --> 01:16:49,058
Granted, it's not on
the list of approved bendables,

1107
01:16:49,165 --> 01:16:55,661
but I'm so great!

1108
01:17:01,577 --> 01:17:04,102
Dogs! The boning continues.

1109
01:17:05,180 --> 01:17:08,638
Green Bluebird, this is Mr. Fabulous.
We are go for cheesing it.

1110
01:17:26,233 --> 01:17:29,828
Professor! Hermes! Zoidberg!

1111
01:17:32,272 --> 01:17:34,035
Scruffy. A janitor.

1112
01:17:34,241 --> 01:17:35,435
You helped us escape?

1113
01:17:35,542 --> 01:17:39,376
Even after we locked you in a go-go
cage like common go-go dancers?

1114
01:17:39,479 --> 01:17:45,314
I couldn't live with myself, Leela.
I call myself a scientist,

1115
01:17:45,418 --> 01:17:48,979
wear the white coat and probe
a monkey every now and again,

1116
01:17:49,222 --> 01:17:53,556
yet I put monetary gain
ahead of preserving nature.

1117
01:17:53,659 --> 01:17:55,923
Can you ever forgive me?

1118
01:17:56,662 --> 01:17:57,651
I reckon.

1119
01:17:57,763 --> 01:18:02,165
- I could kiss you, Professor.
- Okay, but watch out for my new grill.

1120
01:18:10,075 --> 01:18:13,169
Before the grand finale, as it were,

1121
01:18:13,278 --> 01:18:17,078
it seems only fitting that I,
Commodore 64 Zapp Brannigan,

1122
01:18:17,182 --> 01:18:19,240
say a few brief pages in honor of...

1123
01:18:19,350 --> 01:18:23,252
<i>Whatever your plan is,
Fry, I suggest you get on with it.</i>

1124
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:26,321
<i>Get... Shoot, I got hot
sauce on my Number 9 shirt.</i>

1125
01:18:26,790 --> 01:18:31,557
<i>Okay, locate the Dark One by finding
someone whose thoughts I can't read.</i>

1126
01:18:32,029 --> 01:18:33,030
And unaccustomed...

1127
01:18:33,264 --> 01:18:36,664
<i>By God!
I'm the greatest speaker of all time.</i>

1128
01:18:36,766 --> 01:18:40,224
<i>They're suckling at the
teats of my every syllable.</i>

1129
01:18:40,336 --> 01:18:41,598
Allow me now...

1130
01:18:42,272 --> 01:18:46,470
<i>His voice is like ear sandpaper.
I miss Amy.</i>

1131
01:18:46,909 --> 01:18:48,740
<i>The one secret
no one ever suspected</i>

1132
01:18:48,845 --> 01:18:51,313
<i>is that I really did
stage the moon landing.</i>

1133
01:18:51,948 --> 01:18:52,972
<i>On Venus.</i>

1134
01:18:55,484 --> 01:19:00,854
<i>If I had all the money
in the world, I'd... Oh, wait. I do.</i>

1135
01:19:03,158 --> 01:19:07,561
<i>I'd like to thank the academy,
my agent, and most of all,</i>

1136
01:19:07,696 --> 01:19:11,927
<i>my operating system,
Windows Vista, for everything it...</i>

1137
01:19:12,033 --> 01:19:13,398
<i>System error.</i>

1138
01:19:13,501 --> 01:19:16,299
<i>Naked ladies. Naked ladies.
Naked ladies. Naked ladies.</i>

1139
01:19:16,404 --> 01:19:20,568
<i>I never should have taken that accent
elimination class from Jackie Chan.</i>

1140
01:19:21,042 --> 01:19:24,478
And so, as we obliterize this star,

1141
01:19:24,578 --> 01:19:29,446
<i>let us remember those immortal words
once spoken by a great man, moi.</i>

1142
01:19:29,549 --> 01:19:32,882
And I quote, "All good
things must come to an end,

1143
01:19:32,986 --> 01:19:35,250
"preferably in
a humongous explosion. "

1144
01:19:37,390 --> 01:19:39,324
Let's pop this beach ball.

1145
01:19:40,026 --> 01:19:42,358
Ten! Nine!

1146
01:19:43,129 --> 01:19:44,619
Eight!

1147
01:19:48,767 --> 01:19:50,667
<i>There's no one here whose
thoughts can't be read.</i>

1148
01:19:50,769 --> 01:19:53,795
<i>No one, except me!</i>

1149
01:19:54,173 --> 01:19:57,540
<i>My thoughts can't be read.
But that's crazy.</i>

1150
01:19:57,676 --> 01:20:00,770
<i>If I were the Dark One,
I'd know it, wouldn't I?</i>

1151
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:04,478
<i>But, here I am, right where
the Dark One would be,</i>

1152
01:20:04,583 --> 01:20:06,413
<i>about to blow up the star.</i>

1153
01:20:06,517 --> 01:20:09,918
<i>Oh, God! Somewhere deep
inside of me, it's me!</i>

1154
01:20:10,021 --> 01:20:11,249
<i>I'm the Dark One!</i>

1155
01:20:14,992 --> 01:20:16,687
<i>Put your hands in the air!</i>

1156
01:20:17,562 --> 01:20:19,530
Should we wave them
like we just don't care?

1157
01:20:19,630 --> 01:20:21,257
<i>That's optional.</i>

1158
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:26,729
You girl punks gone too far this time.
Your parents should be ashamed.

1159
01:20:26,870 --> 01:20:28,337
Yes, you should!

1160
01:20:30,607 --> 01:20:32,939
- Amy?
- Amy!

1161
01:20:33,043 --> 01:20:35,409
<i>Destroy the star, Leo, hurry.</i>

1162
01:20:35,512 --> 01:20:37,742
You got it, Mr. Voice-in-my-head.

1163
01:20:46,322 --> 01:20:50,258
I've gotta admit, Amy,
you got a pretty good swing.

1164
01:20:51,260 --> 01:20:53,728
Really? Thanks, Dad.

1165
01:20:55,831 --> 01:20:59,164
Okay, time to defuse
this star cracker once and for all.

1166
01:21:00,468 --> 01:21:02,561
Leela, wait.
You're making a mistake.

1167
01:21:02,670 --> 01:21:04,695
You have no idea
what's really going on.

1168
01:21:04,806 --> 01:21:06,433
What is really going on?

1169
01:21:06,541 --> 01:21:07,565
I can't tell you.

1170
01:21:07,675 --> 01:21:10,166
Then why should I trust you? Why?

1171
01:21:10,278 --> 01:21:12,838
Because... Because...

1172
01:21:20,154 --> 01:21:22,850
You're you. That's all I need to know.

1173
01:21:23,824 --> 01:21:25,655
- No! Don't do it!
- Fiddlesticks.

1174
01:21:25,759 --> 01:21:27,886
Leela, are you crazy?

1175
01:21:27,995 --> 01:21:31,158
We became fugitives
and jail-breakers to stop him.

1176
01:21:31,265 --> 01:21:33,563
And hookers, don't forget hookers.

1177
01:21:33,667 --> 01:21:34,998
Shame on all of you.

1178
01:21:35,102 --> 01:21:38,093
After everything we've been through
together, do you really think Fry would...

1179
01:21:43,676 --> 01:21:47,669
Goodbye, Leela.
I destroy myself to save you.

1180
01:21:57,956 --> 01:22:01,084
Where's the boom?
I was expecting a boom.

1181
01:22:01,293 --> 01:22:05,093
It didn't work. I'm the Dark One,
and it didn't do anything.

1182
01:22:05,197 --> 01:22:08,064
You're not the Dark One, I am.

1183
01:22:08,166 --> 01:22:09,360
Leela?

1184
01:22:09,468 --> 01:22:11,561
Not Leela, you moron. Me!

1185
01:22:13,471 --> 01:22:15,234
What did you do to me?

1186
01:22:17,007 --> 01:22:17,996
Ew!

1187
01:22:18,843 --> 01:22:22,506
I am the Dark One.
The very last Dark One.

1188
01:22:22,746 --> 01:22:26,079
How is it possible
I couldn't read your mind?

1189
01:22:26,851 --> 01:22:29,910
Oh, I am momentarily disabled.

1190
01:22:38,695 --> 01:22:41,755
What's happening out there?

1191
01:22:41,865 --> 01:22:43,765
Somethings wondersful.

1192
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:09,647
The star and the asteroid.
They were an egg and a sperm.

1193
01:23:09,757 --> 01:23:13,284
Great modem of mercy.
Cover the children's eyes.

1194
01:23:13,394 --> 01:23:14,725
There are no children here.

1195
01:23:14,829 --> 01:23:16,990
Then move your fat head.
I can't see.

1196
01:23:31,144 --> 01:23:36,081
The Encyclopod is reborn.
A new green age has begun!

1197
01:23:36,182 --> 01:23:38,412
So the legend foretold.

1198
01:23:48,294 --> 01:23:53,322
Look! Inside its pouch.
Extinct Tasmanian tigers.

1199
01:23:53,632 --> 01:23:56,658
And dodo birds.
And white rhinos.

1200
01:23:56,769 --> 01:23:59,533
And striped biologist-taunters.

1201
01:23:59,638 --> 01:24:01,832
What are you gonna do, shoot us?

1202
01:24:07,078 --> 01:24:08,045
Life!

1203
01:24:10,648 --> 01:24:15,847
These once extinct plants
and animals are my gift to the universe.

1204
01:24:16,187 --> 01:24:20,350
Through untold generations,
my race has treasured their DNA.

1205
01:24:20,791 --> 01:24:25,387
Treat them wisely with the knowledge
that all species are precious.

1206
01:24:25,729 --> 01:24:28,960
This is unbelievable. What's going on?

1207
01:24:29,066 --> 01:24:31,933
To answer that, I must tell you a story.

1208
01:24:32,169 --> 01:24:35,536
A story of two alien
species so ancient that...

1209
01:24:39,942 --> 01:24:44,379
- Hutch, are you okay?
- My sister's femi-necklace.

1210
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:45,504
What?

1211
01:24:47,883 --> 01:24:50,408
Hey, how come I can't
read your thoughts anymore?

1212
01:24:51,754 --> 01:24:55,883
I shall avenge you, Hutch Waterfall.

1213
01:25:00,895 --> 01:25:05,491
After all these eons,
the Dark Ones are no more.

1214
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:10,060
Will you preserve their
DNA, O Great Encyclopod?

1215
01:25:11,539 --> 01:25:14,837
I suppose I should.
Wait, where did it go?

1216
01:25:18,545 --> 01:25:19,512
What?

1217
01:25:19,780 --> 01:25:24,513
<i>Well, at any rate, I shall
preserve the DNA of Homo sapiens.</i>

1218
01:25:30,623 --> 01:25:33,717
I thought you only saved the
DNA of endangered species.

1219
01:25:33,826 --> 01:25:34,793
Farewell.

1220
01:25:37,130 --> 01:25:38,324
I guess he didn't hear me.

1221
01:25:38,431 --> 01:25:42,492
Well, looks like that wraps everything
up in a nice big, old, fat sack of...

1222
01:25:42,602 --> 01:25:47,335
I hereby arrest you
fugitives on 53 counts of fugivity.

1223
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:50,931
Kif, round them up,
and spare me the weary sigh for once.

1224
01:25:51,777 --> 01:25:52,744
Kif.

1225
01:25:53,645 --> 01:25:55,010
Wait for me.

1226
01:26:08,526 --> 01:26:12,724
Well, this is the end. There was so
many things I wanted to say to you.

1227
01:26:12,830 --> 01:26:14,297
Like what?

1228
01:26:14,398 --> 01:26:18,425
Like this is not the end.
But mostly just, I love you, Leela.

1229
01:26:20,871 --> 01:26:25,898
Maybe I waited too long to say this,
but I love you, too. Wormhole!

1230
01:26:27,143 --> 01:26:30,635
Sweet topology of
cosmology, it's huge!

1231
01:26:30,747 --> 01:26:35,275
If we fly into it, it could take
us trillions of light years away.

1232
01:26:35,385 --> 01:26:37,910
There's no knowing if we'll ever return.

1233
01:26:38,021 --> 01:26:40,387
What do we do?
Should we go for it?

1234
01:26:44,026 --> 01:26:48,258
Into the breach, meatbags.
Or not. Whatever.

1235
01:26:48,363 --> 01:26:51,389
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go.

1236
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:53,991
Go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go.

1237
01:26:54,305 --> 01:27:54,358
