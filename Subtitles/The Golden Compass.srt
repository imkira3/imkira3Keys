1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:40,493 --> 00:00:44,987
There are many universes
and many earths...

3
00:00:45,031 --> 00:00:47,022
parallel to each other.

4
00:00:49,235 --> 00:00:50,793
Worlds like yours...

5
00:00:50,837 --> 00:00:54,295
where people's souls
live inside their bodies...

6
00:00:59,545 --> 00:01:01,638
and worlds like mine...

7
00:01:01,681 --> 00:01:03,979
where they walk beside us...

8
00:01:04,016 --> 00:01:07,816
as animal spirits
we call dæmons.

9
00:01:09,589 --> 00:01:11,420
Are we going to see the child?

10
00:01:12,725 --> 00:01:14,488
I should think so.

11
00:01:15,828 --> 00:01:17,762
So many worlds...

12
00:01:17,797 --> 00:01:21,028
but connecting them all is Dust.

13
00:01:21,067 --> 00:01:24,400
Dust was here before
the witches of the air...

14
00:01:24,437 --> 00:01:27,463
the Gyptians of the water...

15
00:01:27,507 --> 00:01:29,998
and the bears of the ice.

16
00:01:31,911 --> 00:01:35,870
In my world,
scholars invented an alethiometer...

17
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,948
a golden compass...

18
00:01:39,986 --> 00:01:42,921
and it showed them
all that was hidden.

19
00:01:44,657 --> 00:01:48,753
But the ruling power, fearing
any truth but their own...

20
00:01:48,794 --> 00:01:51,661
destroyed these devices...

21
00:01:51,697 --> 00:01:55,963
and forbade
the very mention of Dust.

22
00:01:56,002 --> 00:01:59,369
One compass remains, however...

23
00:01:59,405 --> 00:02:02,169
and only one who can read it.

24
00:02:02,542 --> 00:02:03,907
You'll never get me!

25
00:02:07,346 --> 00:02:09,371
Let's go get 'em, Lyra.

26
00:02:09,782 --> 00:02:11,147
Come on!

27
00:02:11,183 --> 00:02:12,514
Gonna get you!

28
00:02:12,552 --> 00:02:14,486
I'll get you first!

29
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,181
Billy!

30
00:02:16,222 --> 00:02:18,190
You come back here!

31
00:02:18,224 --> 00:02:19,623
Leave me alone!

32
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:20,956
Faster, faster!

33
00:02:20,993 --> 00:02:22,722
We're gonna get you!

34
00:02:22,762 --> 00:02:24,491
Run, Roger!

35
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:28,223
You are now Gobbled!

36
00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:31,896
You've gotta do whatever I say!

37
00:02:33,706 --> 00:02:35,674
Go, Roger! Run!

38
00:02:38,911 --> 00:02:39,878
Come on! Come on! Hurry!

39
00:02:39,912 --> 00:02:42,745
- Leave us alone!
- Get him!

40
00:02:46,118 --> 00:02:47,710
Come on. Run!

41
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,519
Hurry up, Roger,
or they'll Gobble you!

42
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:54,753
Faster!

43
00:02:59,932 --> 00:03:02,025
Hurry up!

44
00:03:02,068 --> 00:03:04,366
Stop!

45
00:03:04,403 --> 00:03:08,362
If you value your lives,
come no further.

46
00:03:08,407 --> 00:03:09,601
Why?

47
00:03:09,642 --> 00:03:11,405
We Gobbled him fair and square.

48
00:03:11,444 --> 00:03:13,912
This ain't no game, Billy Costa.

49
00:03:13,946 --> 00:03:15,846
Don't you know what this gate is?

50
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:18,179
It's the back door
to your stupid college.

51
00:03:18,217 --> 00:03:19,206
So?

52
00:03:19,251 --> 00:03:21,719
There's a curse on this gate.

53
00:03:21,754 --> 00:03:24,416
You Gyptians ought to know that.

54
00:03:24,457 --> 00:03:25,617
Crossin' this gate...

55
00:03:25,658 --> 00:03:28,218
is worse than touching
someone's dæmon...

56
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,591
with your bare hands.

57
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:31,961
Why ain't nothin'
happened to you, then?

58
00:03:31,998 --> 00:03:33,795
'Cause we live 'ere.

59
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,926
We got safe passage, see?

60
00:03:35,968 --> 00:03:38,493
And anyway, my mother's
the one who put the curse...

61
00:03:38,537 --> 00:03:40,198
on this gate in the first place.

62
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,570
What mother?

63
00:03:41,607 --> 00:03:43,302
I heard you was an orphink...

64
00:03:43,342 --> 00:03:46,539
and your uncle only left you 'ere
'cause nobody wanted you.

65
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:48,103
Come 'ere and say that.

66
00:03:48,948 --> 00:03:50,813
Don't, Billy.

67
00:03:52,785 --> 00:03:54,616
You should listen to your mate.

68
00:03:54,654 --> 00:03:58,283
The scholars got this special room
where they deal with trespassers.

69
00:03:58,324 --> 00:04:00,349
They got this poison gown, right...

70
00:04:00,393 --> 00:04:02,293
and it burns you alive!

71
00:04:02,328 --> 00:04:05,229
Rubbish. Hand him over.

72
00:04:05,998 --> 00:04:09,900
It ain't rubbish.
I'll prove it. I'll steal it.

73
00:04:09,935 --> 00:04:11,596
You can have Roger.

74
00:04:11,637 --> 00:04:14,162
As long as you try it on.

75
00:04:14,206 --> 00:04:17,107
All right. Bring it with you tonight.

76
00:04:17,143 --> 00:04:18,405
Or else...

77
00:04:19,345 --> 00:04:20,869
War.

78
00:04:22,314 --> 00:04:23,781
Billy, don't!

79
00:04:25,751 --> 00:04:26,979
See ya later, then.

80
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:28,919
OK.

81
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:32,414
Well done, Billy!

82
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,483
You ain't really gonna
hand me over to them?

83
00:04:34,527 --> 00:04:35,994
Of course not.

84
00:04:36,028 --> 00:04:37,791
I'll steal any old scholar's gown.

85
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,764
He'll never try it on anyway.

86
00:04:47,239 --> 00:04:48,672
- Lord Asriel?
- Morning, Hunt.

87
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:51,302
Well, the Master will be relieved
to hear you've arrived safely.

88
00:04:51,343 --> 00:04:52,867
I'm sure he will.

89
00:05:26,145 --> 00:05:28,545
I wish you'd listen
to me once in a while.

90
00:05:28,581 --> 00:05:30,481
Stop being such a coward.

91
00:05:30,516 --> 00:05:32,916
If I weren't such a coward,
where would you be?

92
00:05:32,952 --> 00:05:35,921
In the Retiring Room already.

93
00:05:42,361 --> 00:05:43,726
Come on, quick.

94
00:05:49,034 --> 00:05:51,264
Let's find a robe
and get out of here.

95
00:05:52,204 --> 00:05:55,537
Don't be silly.
I want to look around.

96
00:05:55,574 --> 00:05:58,338
You do know that if you get
a smack, I hurt too?

97
00:06:03,816 --> 00:06:05,613
Oh, Lyra.

98
00:06:05,651 --> 00:06:08,245
You're gonna get us caught.

99
00:06:12,057 --> 00:06:14,787
Oh, no! I told you!

100
00:06:17,897 --> 00:06:20,491
Lord Asriel is an eminent
fellow of the college.

101
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:24,526
And as master of Jordan,
you must force him...

102
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,435
to abandon his plan.

103
00:06:26,472 --> 00:06:28,906
They're talking about Uncle Asriel.

104
00:06:28,941 --> 00:06:31,569
I speak for the Magisterium.

105
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:34,977
The Magisterium has no authority
within these walls.

106
00:06:35,014 --> 00:06:37,812
My dear fellow...

107
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:41,149
the Magisterium
has authority everywhere...

108
00:06:42,388 --> 00:06:45,653
and Lord Asriel will be silenced...

109
00:06:45,691 --> 00:06:48,683
one way or another.

110
00:06:48,727 --> 00:06:50,820
That may be.

111
00:06:50,863 --> 00:06:53,764
But while he is at Jordan,
his proposal will be heard.

112
00:06:55,334 --> 00:06:58,826
I'll not dispense with centuries
of tolerance and free inquiry.

113
00:06:58,871 --> 00:07:00,839
And that's my final word
on the matter.

114
00:07:01,841 --> 00:07:03,832
Now, if you'll excuse me...

115
00:07:08,514 --> 00:07:10,982
I shall call the Council to order.

116
00:07:17,556 --> 00:07:18,989
I guess we lost that bet.

117
00:07:19,024 --> 00:07:21,492
Hush, Pan.

118
00:07:46,085 --> 00:07:49,077
Lyra, he's leaving. Let's go.

119
00:07:49,121 --> 00:07:50,110
Lyra.

120
00:07:51,657 --> 00:07:55,320
- The professor--a really hard time.
- Oh, no.

121
00:07:56,495 --> 00:07:58,156
It's Stelmaria.

122
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,898
The master asked me to decant a bottle
of the '99 Tokay for you, Lord Asriel.

123
00:08:05,938 --> 00:08:07,906
He remembered
you were partial to it.

124
00:08:08,741 --> 00:08:09,765
Thank you.

125
00:08:28,761 --> 00:08:30,558
- Lyra!
- It's poisoned.

126
00:08:30,596 --> 00:08:32,723
- Nonsense.
- It ain't nonsense.

127
00:08:32,765 --> 00:08:34,995
I saw that man
from the Magisterium...

128
00:08:35,034 --> 00:08:37,002
pour some powder into the wine.

129
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,898
Go back in there.

130
00:08:42,942 --> 00:08:44,500
Keep your eyes open
and your mouth shut.

131
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,477
Go on.

132
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,787
Ah, Lord Asriel.

133
00:08:57,823 --> 00:08:59,313
This is a rare pleasure.

134
00:08:59,358 --> 00:09:04,557
May I introduce
Fra Pavel of the Magisterium?

135
00:09:04,596 --> 00:09:10,296
We've never met, but I've followed
your exploits closely, Lord Asriel.

136
00:09:10,336 --> 00:09:11,963
That's what the smell is.

137
00:09:12,004 --> 00:09:14,472
Master, gentlemen,
I shall get straight to the point.

138
00:09:14,506 --> 00:09:16,133
Hunt, the lights.

139
00:09:18,477 --> 00:09:21,776
This photogram was taken
at the magnetic North Pole...

140
00:09:23,349 --> 00:09:25,783
in Svalbard...

141
00:09:27,386 --> 00:09:29,377
kingdom of the ice bears.

142
00:09:29,421 --> 00:09:31,321
Ice bears, Pan.

143
00:09:31,357 --> 00:09:35,453
Lord Asriel, is that light rising up
from the man's body or coming down?

144
00:09:35,494 --> 00:09:38,554
No, that's coming down from the sky,
but that's not light.

145
00:09:42,568 --> 00:09:44,001
- It's Dust.
- Dust?

146
00:09:48,907 --> 00:09:51,398
- What's Dust?
- I don't know.

147
00:09:51,443 --> 00:09:52,933
It can't be the normal sort.

148
00:09:52,978 --> 00:09:55,344
They've got plenty of that here.

149
00:09:55,381 --> 00:09:57,212
Mirabile dictu, gentlemen.

150
00:09:57,249 --> 00:10:00,514
Allow Lord Asriel to explain.

151
00:10:00,552 --> 00:10:04,147
Perhaps you've made a mistake.

152
00:10:04,189 --> 00:10:07,625
It could be an aberration
or malfunction of some kind.

153
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:10,526
No, it is no aberration.

154
00:10:11,797 --> 00:10:15,164
The behavior of these particles
is quite unmistakable.

155
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,796
Dust is flowing into this man,
through his dæmon...

156
00:10:19,838 --> 00:10:22,534
from a city in another world.

157
00:10:22,574 --> 00:10:26,533
A world much like ours in a parallel
universe coexisting with our own.

158
00:10:26,578 --> 00:10:29,775
Invisible, intangible, inaccessible!

159
00:10:29,815 --> 00:10:30,839
Until now.

160
00:10:30,883 --> 00:10:34,614
From there, and from
a billion other worlds, Dust flows.

161
00:10:34,653 --> 00:10:37,349
Worlds of infinite possibilities.

162
00:10:37,389 --> 00:10:38,981
Some where men have no dæmons.

163
00:10:39,024 --> 00:10:40,719
Some where dæmons have no men.

164
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:43,353
People without dæmons.
That's impossible.

165
00:10:43,395 --> 00:10:46,057
And even some where
there is no Magisterium...

166
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,994
and no Authority.

167
00:10:50,936 --> 00:10:52,494
That is heresy.

168
00:10:52,538 --> 00:10:54,403
That...

169
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,009
is the truth.

170
00:10:58,043 --> 00:11:02,537
I wouldn't recommend the Tokay,
gentlemen. It's corked.

171
00:11:02,581 --> 00:11:05,744
To discover the source of Dust,
I intend to travel to these worlds.

172
00:11:05,784 --> 00:11:08,252
With a sufficient source
of energy and--

173
00:11:08,287 --> 00:11:10,414
Well, a sufficient source of funds...

174
00:11:12,024 --> 00:11:13,855
I can effect a crossing.

175
00:11:13,892 --> 00:11:16,861
I humbly beg the College Council
to fund such a journey.

176
00:11:22,968 --> 00:11:25,596
It wasn't my fault.
She wouldn't listen to me.

177
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:30,768
I will not have my niece
slithering round like an alley cat.

178
00:11:30,809 --> 00:11:33,778
You're not very grateful, are you?

179
00:11:33,812 --> 00:11:35,541
I've just saved your life.

180
00:11:38,317 --> 00:11:40,547
Uncle, why did he try
to poison you?

181
00:11:40,586 --> 00:11:42,247
- You wouldn't understand.
- Yes, I would.

182
00:11:42,287 --> 00:11:44,187
Well, I don't see why.

183
00:11:44,223 --> 00:11:46,248
Apparently you're
impossible to educate.

184
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,020
A miscreant and a liar.

185
00:11:50,562 --> 00:11:53,224
What will the Magisterium
do to you now?

186
00:11:53,265 --> 00:11:55,893
The Magisterium's days
are numbered.

187
00:11:55,934 --> 00:11:57,663
What does that mean?

188
00:11:57,703 --> 00:11:59,967
Trouble, with a bit of luck.

189
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,240
Did you get the money you needed?

190
00:12:03,275 --> 00:12:04,708
Are you going North again?

191
00:12:04,743 --> 00:12:07,473
The College Council
has defied the Magisterium.

192
00:12:07,513 --> 00:12:09,447
I'm leaving immediately.

193
00:12:09,481 --> 00:12:10,971
Can I come with you?

194
00:12:11,016 --> 00:12:12,847
I want to see the ice bears
and glaciers...

195
00:12:12,885 --> 00:12:14,546
and learn about Dust
and everything.

196
00:12:14,586 --> 00:12:16,713
What do you know about Dust?

197
00:12:16,755 --> 00:12:18,279
- Nothing.
- Good.

198
00:12:18,323 --> 00:12:19,654
Keep it that way.

199
00:12:19,691 --> 00:12:21,955
Now be a good girl
and do what you're told.

200
00:12:21,994 --> 00:12:23,791
But you don't do what you're told.

201
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:25,854
You don't let anybody
tell you what to do.

202
00:12:25,898 --> 00:12:27,729
Yes, and look at the welcome I got.

203
00:12:31,803 --> 00:12:33,236
Hush, Pan.

204
00:12:33,272 --> 00:12:35,399
I see your dæmon
still changes shape.

205
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,305
Hasn't settled yet.

206
00:12:37,342 --> 00:12:38,832
Yeah.

207
00:12:40,979 --> 00:12:43,470
That's to do with Dust, isn't it?

208
00:12:43,515 --> 00:12:45,449
Why kids' dæmons
can change shape...

209
00:12:45,484 --> 00:12:47,349
but grown-ups' dæmons can't.

210
00:12:48,287 --> 00:12:50,448
Lyra.

211
00:12:50,489 --> 00:12:52,582
Dust is none of your business.

212
00:12:53,992 --> 00:12:55,960
Now you try and behave.

213
00:13:10,475 --> 00:13:15,310
My Uncle Asriel said he'd take me
to the North next time he goes. He swore it.

214
00:13:15,347 --> 00:13:16,905
'Cause he needs my help, see.

215
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:18,280
What for?

216
00:13:19,318 --> 00:13:21,149
Fightin', probably.

217
00:13:21,186 --> 00:13:22,778
Or spying.

218
00:13:22,821 --> 00:13:24,789
He uses me as a spy sometimes.

219
00:13:24,823 --> 00:13:26,757
Like now, for instance.

220
00:13:26,792 --> 00:13:28,726
I'm supposed to be keeping
an eye on them Gobblers--

221
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,749
Come on!

222
00:13:29,795 --> 00:13:32,195
...'cause they took them
Gyptian kids up Banbury way.

223
00:13:32,231 --> 00:13:33,664
Billy Costa told me.

224
00:13:33,699 --> 00:13:36,827
I heard them Gobblers
take you down to hell.

225
00:13:36,868 --> 00:13:38,836
Course they don't.

226
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:42,070
You're afraid of them, ain't you?

227
00:13:42,107 --> 00:13:43,199
No, I ain't.

228
00:13:46,178 --> 00:13:49,545
But the adults are,
because kids keep disappearin'.

229
00:13:49,581 --> 00:13:51,845
They go after the poor kids, see.

230
00:13:51,883 --> 00:13:55,819
The orphans
and the servant kids as well.

231
00:13:55,854 --> 00:13:58,448
Roger, I promise...

232
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:01,084
if you was taken by the Gobblers...

233
00:14:01,126 --> 00:14:02,388
I'd come and rescue you.

234
00:14:04,229 --> 00:14:06,220
You'd come and get me too,
wouldn't you?

235
00:14:06,265 --> 00:14:10,031
Course. But everybody would go
looking for you if you was Gobbled.

236
00:14:10,068 --> 00:14:12,229
- You're a lady.
- Says who?

237
00:14:12,271 --> 00:14:16,571
Cook. He says that's why your uncle
left you here, to make you a lady.

238
00:14:16,608 --> 00:14:18,405
Nobody can make me a lady.

239
00:14:18,443 --> 00:14:22,277
Not the master and scholars
and porters combined, right?

240
00:14:22,314 --> 00:14:25,613
Take it back, or we ain't
best mates no more!

241
00:14:25,651 --> 00:14:27,551
All right, all right,
you ain't a lady.

242
00:14:27,586 --> 00:14:29,281
Lyra!

243
00:14:29,321 --> 00:14:32,688
Lyra Belacqua,
get down off them roofs!

244
00:14:32,724 --> 00:14:34,282
The Master wants you at high table!

245
00:14:36,928 --> 00:14:39,863
It was really--
really quite surprising.

246
00:14:39,898 --> 00:14:42,093
The state of your knees.

247
00:14:42,134 --> 00:14:44,261
And your hair.

248
00:14:44,303 --> 00:14:45,292
Well--

249
00:14:46,738 --> 00:14:48,103
It's not surprising.

250
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,938
Roger and me's
been huntin' Gobblers.

251
00:14:50,976 --> 00:14:52,705
It's dirty work.

252
00:14:52,744 --> 00:14:56,145
'Ere, don't you make jokes
about them Gobblers.

253
00:14:56,181 --> 00:14:58,979
Ain't nothin' to play about
when children go missing.

254
00:15:10,228 --> 00:15:11,991
Lyra, my dear...

255
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:15,625
the tutor of metaphysics tells me
that you've missed your lesson again.

256
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:19,603
Now, I know you do not always
understand our need to educate you...

257
00:15:19,638 --> 00:15:23,972
but sometimes you must do
what others think...best.

258
00:15:25,677 --> 00:15:27,838
But I disagree, Master.

259
00:15:28,413 --> 00:15:29,402
Mrs. Coulter.

260
00:15:32,084 --> 00:15:33,483
When I was a young woman...

261
00:15:33,518 --> 00:15:36,578
I knew that no one could ever
really truly understand me...

262
00:15:36,621 --> 00:15:38,782
except, of course, my dæmon...

263
00:15:38,824 --> 00:15:41,850
and that it would be best
if we were free to do as we pleased.

264
00:15:46,832 --> 00:15:48,823
Sit down, gentlemen.

265
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:51,426
- Who's she?
- Don't know.

266
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,802
But she shut up the Master, all right.

267
00:15:53,839 --> 00:16:00,472
Mrs. Coulter? This is our Lyra,
Lyra Belacqua, Lord Asriel's niece.

268
00:16:00,512 --> 00:16:02,980
Lyra, this is Mrs. Coulter...

269
00:16:03,014 --> 00:16:05,278
a friend of the college.

270
00:16:08,019 --> 00:16:09,850
Lovely to meet you.

271
00:16:09,888 --> 00:16:12,721
Lovely to meet you too.

272
00:16:12,758 --> 00:16:15,750
Do you know I've met Lord Asriel?

273
00:16:16,361 --> 00:16:18,659
It was at the Royal Arctic Institute.

274
00:16:19,297 --> 00:16:21,231
We discussed
the political structure...

275
00:16:21,266 --> 00:16:23,632
of the ice bears of Svalbard.

276
00:16:24,536 --> 00:16:26,401
You've seen an ice bear?

277
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:28,433
As a matter of fact...

278
00:16:28,473 --> 00:16:31,135
I have had an audience
with the bear king himself...

279
00:16:31,176 --> 00:16:32,700
Ragnar Sturlusson.

280
00:16:32,744 --> 00:16:35,338
And I'll tell you something
I probably shouldn't--

281
00:16:36,815 --> 00:16:40,376
King Ragnar is desperate
to have a dæmon of his own.

282
00:16:42,621 --> 00:16:45,522
Bears don't have them, you see,
and Ragnar...

283
00:16:45,557 --> 00:16:48,048
he likes to think of himself
as a person...

284
00:16:48,093 --> 00:16:50,891
and he will stop at nothing to get one.

285
00:16:52,931 --> 00:16:54,523
But you mustn't repeat that.

286
00:16:54,566 --> 00:16:56,261
Oh, I'd never.

287
00:16:59,404 --> 00:17:01,599
You know, I feel I can trust you.

288
00:17:05,877 --> 00:17:08,778
I have to go back
to the North very soon.

289
00:17:08,814 --> 00:17:10,782
I'm going to need an assistant.

290
00:17:12,284 --> 00:17:13,751
Me?

291
00:17:13,785 --> 00:17:15,776
- Go to the North?
- North?

292
00:17:15,821 --> 00:17:17,345
It's cold up there.

293
00:17:17,389 --> 00:17:19,857
We'd better get
the Master's permission.

294
00:17:21,993 --> 00:17:24,587
Master, I was wondering...

295
00:17:24,629 --> 00:17:27,120
if I might borrow dear Lyra.

296
00:17:29,301 --> 00:17:30,825
Only for a while, of course.

297
00:17:32,537 --> 00:17:34,129
I'm not sure
that would be consistent with...

298
00:17:34,172 --> 00:17:36,697
Lord Asriel's wishes
for her education.

299
00:17:38,877 --> 00:17:41,471
Let me deal with Asriel.

300
00:17:41,513 --> 00:17:44,914
You mustn't deny me
this little thing, you really mustn't.

301
00:17:53,492 --> 00:17:54,925
Very well.

302
00:17:58,396 --> 00:18:00,387
Yeah--

303
00:18:01,733 --> 00:18:03,758
Yeah--

304
00:18:11,142 --> 00:18:12,473
A bet's a bet...

305
00:18:12,511 --> 00:18:15,241
and Lyra was supposed
to show up with the gown.

306
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,646
I told you they wouldn't
let her out of the college.

307
00:18:17,682 --> 00:18:19,240
Which one's her room?

308
00:18:19,284 --> 00:18:20,808
What are you gonna do?

309
00:18:20,852 --> 00:18:22,683
Give her a fright, that's all.

310
00:18:22,721 --> 00:18:25,451
We get caught,
I'll be skinned alive.

311
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:28,482
Night porter's bound
to be doin' his rounds.

312
00:18:28,527 --> 00:18:30,654
Ratter, check if the coast is clear.

313
00:18:43,842 --> 00:18:45,275
It's all clear.

314
00:18:48,914 --> 00:18:51,439
Billy! Billy!

315
00:19:00,158 --> 00:19:05,027
The scholars still refuse
to hand over the last alethiometer...

316
00:19:05,063 --> 00:19:09,227
and now they've given Asriel
all the funds he needs.

317
00:19:10,068 --> 00:19:13,595
If he succeeds in proving
the existence of these other worlds...

318
00:19:13,638 --> 00:19:17,472
it will contradict
centuries of teaching.

319
00:19:17,509 --> 00:19:21,673
There will always be
freethinkers and heretics...

320
00:19:21,713 --> 00:19:26,480
unless we deal
with the root of the problem.

321
00:19:26,518 --> 00:19:29,351
That is why Mrs. Coulter's work
is so important.

322
00:19:31,356 --> 00:19:33,017
What progress has she made?

323
00:19:33,058 --> 00:19:36,152
The doctors at Bolvangar...

324
00:19:36,194 --> 00:19:39,322
are close to perfecting
the inoculation...

325
00:19:39,364 --> 00:19:43,323
against the effects of Dust.

326
00:19:43,368 --> 00:19:46,565
I am relieved to hear that.

327
00:19:46,605 --> 00:19:50,803
If we can protect our children
from the corrupting influence of Dust...

328
00:19:50,842 --> 00:19:53,572
before their dæmons settle...

329
00:19:53,612 --> 00:19:57,810
then we will nurture a generation
at peace with itself...

330
00:19:57,849 --> 00:20:01,615
one that will never question
our authority again.

331
00:20:03,355 --> 00:20:05,755
We owe it to the young...

332
00:20:06,925 --> 00:20:08,620
do we not?

333
00:20:12,364 --> 00:20:15,060
I fear our defiance
will not go unpunished...

334
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,864
now she'll be drawn into it.

335
00:20:21,906 --> 00:20:22,930
We've failed her.

336
00:20:22,974 --> 00:20:27,434
We've protected her
as long as we could, Master.

337
00:20:27,479 --> 00:20:29,003
And she's still only a child.

338
00:20:29,047 --> 00:20:30,878
She can't possibly be
a threat to them.

339
00:20:30,915 --> 00:20:32,780
She is.

340
00:20:32,817 --> 00:20:36,378
She's meant to play
a major part in what is to come.

341
00:20:37,856 --> 00:20:39,721
How can you know such things?

342
00:20:41,793 --> 00:20:43,420
The witches.

343
00:20:48,633 --> 00:20:49,964
Thank you. Could you--

344
00:20:50,001 --> 00:20:52,902
Could you stay
by the door, Mrs. Lonsdale?

345
00:20:52,937 --> 00:20:55,462
It's important that I know
if I was followed.

346
00:20:55,507 --> 00:20:57,475
Why yes, Master.

347
00:21:03,248 --> 00:21:05,842
It's for you, Lyra.

348
00:21:05,884 --> 00:21:07,351
What is this?

349
00:21:07,385 --> 00:21:09,319
An alethiometer.

350
00:21:09,354 --> 00:21:13,484
Also known as a golden compass.

351
00:21:16,194 --> 00:21:20,358
It was given to the college
by Lord Asriel many years ago.

352
00:21:20,398 --> 00:21:23,834
And now I'm giving it to you.

353
00:21:23,868 --> 00:21:26,769
I feel you are meant to have it.

354
00:21:26,805 --> 00:21:29,069
What's it for?

355
00:21:31,376 --> 00:21:34,004
It tells the truth.

356
00:21:34,045 --> 00:21:36,411
We've always tried
to acquaint you with the truth.

357
00:21:36,448 --> 00:21:39,417
But the secrets at the heart
of things elude scholars...

358
00:21:39,451 --> 00:21:41,544
and, uh, Authorities.

359
00:21:41,586 --> 00:21:45,352
But this lets you
glimpse things as they are.

360
00:21:46,825 --> 00:21:50,591
But, Lyra,
keep the alethiometer to yourself.

361
00:21:50,628 --> 00:21:51,925
It is of the utmost importance...

362
00:21:51,963 --> 00:21:54,363
that Mrs. Coulter
does not know that you have it.

363
00:21:54,399 --> 00:21:55,423
Do you understand me?

364
00:21:55,467 --> 00:21:57,458
Of the utmost importance.

365
00:22:02,073 --> 00:22:05,406
Lyra. Are you ready?

366
00:22:07,278 --> 00:22:08,745
There's someone missing.

367
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,907
I want to say goodbye to Roger.

368
00:22:10,949 --> 00:22:14,544
Roger? Who's Roger?

369
00:22:14,586 --> 00:22:17,146
My friend.
He works in the kitchens.

370
00:22:18,389 --> 00:22:21,051
We must go.
The ferry's about to take off.

371
00:22:22,727 --> 00:22:24,388
Why don't you write him a letter?

372
00:22:24,429 --> 00:22:26,624
You can tell him
all about the journey, and...

373
00:22:26,664 --> 00:22:28,291
you can even send him a photogram.

374
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:29,459
- Madam.
- What do you think?

375
00:22:29,501 --> 00:22:31,628
Yeah. I suppose.

376
00:23:03,234 --> 00:23:05,828
- Anything else, madam?
- That'll be all.

377
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,572
Mrs. Coulter, what's that?

378
00:23:13,044 --> 00:23:16,411
That is the Magisterial seat, Lyra.

379
00:23:18,349 --> 00:23:20,909
What's the Magisterium for?

380
00:23:20,952 --> 00:23:24,115
Oh, you have been living
in an ivory tower, haven't you?

381
00:23:24,155 --> 00:23:27,522
The Magisterium
is what people need.

382
00:23:28,893 --> 00:23:32,624
They keep things working
by telling people what to do.

383
00:23:32,664 --> 00:23:36,657
But...you told the Master
you did whatever you pleased.

384
00:23:38,803 --> 00:23:41,863
That's right. Clever girl.

385
00:23:41,906 --> 00:23:45,467
Well, some people know
what's best for them...

386
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,977
and some people don't.

387
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,738
Besides, they don't tell
people what to do...

388
00:23:49,781 --> 00:23:51,043
in a mean, petty way...

389
00:23:51,082 --> 00:23:53,346
they tell them what
to do in a kindly way...

390
00:23:53,384 --> 00:23:55,852
to keep them out of danger.

391
00:23:57,355 --> 00:23:58,652
Sugar?

392
00:24:54,345 --> 00:24:59,476
Look, Pan, it's got
loads of pictures round the edge.

393
00:24:59,517 --> 00:25:01,212
But what do they all mean?

394
00:25:01,252 --> 00:25:03,083
Don't know.

395
00:25:04,989 --> 00:25:09,085
The needle keeps stopping
at the same symbols--

396
00:25:09,127 --> 00:25:10,958
Lady...

397
00:25:10,995 --> 00:25:12,826
lightning bolt...

398
00:25:12,864 --> 00:25:14,991
and the baby.

399
00:25:15,033 --> 00:25:18,332
Then it goes back
and does it again. See?

400
00:25:18,369 --> 00:25:21,065
What do you think
makes the needle move?

401
00:25:21,105 --> 00:25:24,472
I don't know.
Maybe Uncle Asriel knows.

402
00:25:26,544 --> 00:25:29,138
Maybe we're supposed
to take it to him.

403
00:25:33,885 --> 00:25:35,819
All washed and ready for bed?

404
00:25:37,822 --> 00:25:39,585
We have a busy few weeks.

405
00:25:57,575 --> 00:26:00,703
Well, it was
a stylish enough party...

406
00:26:00,745 --> 00:26:03,270
but why they don't offer
more ice with their drinks...

407
00:26:03,314 --> 00:26:05,179
I shall never understand.

408
00:26:05,216 --> 00:26:07,514
I'll only be a moment, darling.

409
00:26:07,552 --> 00:26:09,042
Official business.

410
00:26:13,224 --> 00:26:14,384
What?

411
00:26:14,425 --> 00:26:17,690
She likes to show off
her new pet, doesn't she?

412
00:26:17,729 --> 00:26:20,289
She's never taking us to the North.

413
00:26:20,331 --> 00:26:21,923
We're like prisoners in this house.

414
00:26:21,966 --> 00:26:25,026
All these rules, and rooms
that we aren't allowed into.

415
00:26:28,106 --> 00:26:31,507
Perhaps we shouldn't have
invited Professor Docker.

416
00:26:31,542 --> 00:26:33,373
He's such a bore, isn't he?

417
00:26:33,411 --> 00:26:35,379
And he had sauce in his beard.

418
00:26:38,883 --> 00:26:42,580
But he is one of the foremost
experts on particle metaphysics.

419
00:26:43,888 --> 00:26:46,118
Have I taught you
what a particle is?

420
00:26:46,157 --> 00:26:48,352
Oh, I know about particles.

421
00:26:48,393 --> 00:26:49,553
Like Dust.

422
00:26:50,261 --> 00:26:51,853
That's a particle, isn't it?

423
00:26:53,031 --> 00:26:54,498
Dust?

424
00:26:54,532 --> 00:26:56,659
I mean the Dust from space.

425
00:26:56,701 --> 00:26:58,931
That Dust, like in the North.

426
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:00,835
Where did you hear about that?

427
00:27:02,607 --> 00:27:04,666
It must have been
one of the scholars at Jordan.

428
00:27:10,248 --> 00:27:11,943
A wise person knows, Lyra...

429
00:27:11,983 --> 00:27:14,178
that there are some things
that we best ignore...

430
00:27:14,218 --> 00:27:18,211
subjects that you--
well, you never speak about.

431
00:27:19,624 --> 00:27:21,785
- But I didn't--
- Yes.

432
00:27:21,826 --> 00:27:24,727
You didn't know, so I forgive you.

433
00:27:24,762 --> 00:27:26,525
Just don't mention it again.

434
00:27:28,566 --> 00:27:30,033
Now, darling...

435
00:27:30,068 --> 00:27:33,196
will you take off that
childish shoulder bag?

436
00:27:33,237 --> 00:27:35,671
I don't like to see you
wearing it indoors.

437
00:27:38,042 --> 00:27:39,907
Please, Mrs. Coulter.

438
00:27:40,945 --> 00:27:42,435
I do love it.

439
00:27:43,214 --> 00:27:44,704
But I do not.

440
00:27:48,386 --> 00:27:50,081
Put it away.

441
00:27:54,125 --> 00:27:56,252
Lyra, put it away now.

442
00:27:56,294 --> 00:27:57,886
I don't want to.

443
00:27:59,363 --> 00:28:01,092
If you do not obey me...

444
00:28:01,132 --> 00:28:02,827
we will have an argument
which I will win.

445
00:28:02,867 --> 00:28:04,767
Now put it away at once.

446
00:28:04,802 --> 00:28:07,498
It's absurd to be carrying
around a shoulder bag...

447
00:28:07,538 --> 00:28:09,506
in your own home.

448
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,405
Jordan is my home.

449
00:28:13,778 --> 00:28:15,507
No! Lyra!

450
00:28:16,814 --> 00:28:19,305
Don't. Please, it hurts!

451
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,612
Lyra!

452
00:28:21,652 --> 00:28:22,778
Lyra!

453
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,310
Will you do as I tell you?

454
00:28:24,355 --> 00:28:25,617
I promise.

455
00:28:30,161 --> 00:28:31,719
Lyra.

456
00:28:33,197 --> 00:28:34,994
Thank you.

457
00:28:36,901 --> 00:28:39,165
And while you're at it, you must
learn to control your dæmon.

458
00:28:39,203 --> 00:28:41,034
He's much too wild.

459
00:28:41,072 --> 00:28:43,302
Now...

460
00:28:43,341 --> 00:28:45,434
Kiss me.

461
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:49,873
I hate her!

462
00:28:51,415 --> 00:28:53,315
I hate them!

463
00:28:53,351 --> 00:28:54,716
And look.

464
00:28:54,752 --> 00:28:56,549
They're spying on us.

465
00:29:02,226 --> 00:29:04,456
What do they want with us?

466
00:29:04,495 --> 00:29:06,463
Why are we here?

467
00:29:06,497 --> 00:29:08,021
Did you see her dæmon?

468
00:29:08,065 --> 00:29:10,659
He went all sharp
when you mentioned Dust.

469
00:29:10,701 --> 00:29:13,067
And what does she keep
in that room?

470
00:29:13,104 --> 00:29:14,765
Let's go find out.

471
00:29:30,488 --> 00:29:33,082
Maybe this isn't such a good idea.

472
00:29:39,564 --> 00:29:41,293
Over here.

473
00:29:50,708 --> 00:29:52,198
Look.

474
00:29:57,515 --> 00:29:59,915
That's just one of
her stupid guest lists.

475
00:29:59,951 --> 00:30:01,282
No, it isn't.

476
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:03,014
Look at it.

477
00:30:08,059 --> 00:30:09,924
"lnter...cision."

478
00:30:10,795 --> 00:30:12,888
What does it mean, Pan?

479
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:13,919
And that--

480
00:30:13,965 --> 00:30:17,401
"General...Oblation Board."

481
00:30:17,435 --> 00:30:20,029
G--O--B.

482
00:30:21,606 --> 00:30:23,506
Gobblers.

483
00:30:23,541 --> 00:30:26,669
From the letters, G--O--B.

484
00:30:28,746 --> 00:30:32,978
"Workman, Edwards, Parslow, Costa!"

485
00:30:33,017 --> 00:30:34,484
Billy and Roger!

486
00:30:37,588 --> 00:30:40,079
Pan, it's her.
She's running the Gobblers.

487
00:30:40,124 --> 00:30:41,648
Lyra, where are you?

488
00:30:41,692 --> 00:30:43,319
We have to get out of here.

489
00:30:45,796 --> 00:30:47,593
Lyr--

490
00:30:47,632 --> 00:30:48,963
Lyra.

491
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,467
What have you been doing?

492
00:30:50,501 --> 00:30:51,627
Nothing.

493
00:30:51,669 --> 00:30:53,466
Well, we must find
something for you to do.

494
00:30:53,504 --> 00:30:56,473
Shall you help me
arrange our passage to Norroway?

495
00:30:58,476 --> 00:31:01,912
Oh, you do want to come
to the North with me, don't you?

496
00:31:01,946 --> 00:31:04,107
Where is he? I don't see him.

497
00:31:14,325 --> 00:31:16,520
Lyra, this way!

498
00:31:18,062 --> 00:31:20,087
Quick, Lyra!

499
00:31:24,335 --> 00:31:25,359
Lyra!

500
00:31:33,077 --> 00:31:35,307
What are we gonna do, Pan?

501
00:31:35,346 --> 00:31:38,315
We've got to save Roger...
and Billy.

502
00:31:38,349 --> 00:31:40,214
We've got
to save ourselves first!

503
00:31:40,251 --> 00:31:41,445
Where are we gonna go?

504
00:31:41,485 --> 00:31:43,350
Anywhere's better than here.

505
00:31:44,722 --> 00:31:47,350
Come on! This way!

506
00:31:51,962 --> 00:31:54,328
All right, then.
Split up. The girl can't be far.

507
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:57,157
Spread out.
Search all the buildings.

508
00:31:57,201 --> 00:31:58,327
Gobblers!

509
00:31:58,369 --> 00:32:00,269
You, cover the canal.

510
00:32:02,206 --> 00:32:04,401
She's gotta be here somewhere.

511
00:32:13,217 --> 00:32:14,684
Wait up, Johnny!

512
00:32:14,719 --> 00:32:16,550
Put your back into it!

513
00:32:16,587 --> 00:32:17,713
We'll need two more of them.

514
00:32:19,056 --> 00:32:22,685
Come on, lovely, lovely
and fresh. Lovely and fresh.

515
00:32:22,727 --> 00:32:26,219
Hurry!

516
00:32:29,867 --> 00:32:31,334
Get her!

517
00:32:31,369 --> 00:32:32,597
Get it!

518
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,764
Pan!

519
00:32:37,808 --> 00:32:39,503
Hurry, Lyra!

520
00:32:46,717 --> 00:32:48,309
Lyra!

521
00:32:48,552 --> 00:32:49,541
Hold her!

522
00:32:52,089 --> 00:32:53,522
No!

523
00:33:06,504 --> 00:33:09,337
- Lyra!
- Pan.

524
00:33:09,373 --> 00:33:11,364
Gyptians.

525
00:33:16,046 --> 00:33:17,775
Don't fret none, Lyra.

526
00:33:19,016 --> 00:33:20,244
Come 'ere.

527
00:33:22,686 --> 00:33:24,677
You're safe with us.

528
00:33:24,722 --> 00:33:27,020
You're Ma Costa.

529
00:33:27,057 --> 00:33:28,115
Billy's mum.

530
00:33:29,693 --> 00:33:31,126
But what are you doing here?

531
00:33:31,162 --> 00:33:32,493
We been in your shadow...

532
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:35,795
ever since you left
Jordan College, watchin' over you.

533
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:38,324
And a good thing too.

534
00:33:38,369 --> 00:33:40,394
You best come with us.

535
00:33:41,605 --> 00:33:42,830
Hurry, lads.

536
00:33:42,873 --> 00:33:44,431
Where are we going?

537
00:33:44,475 --> 00:33:47,205
To see Lord Faa,
King of the Gyptians.

538
00:33:47,244 --> 00:33:49,474
Come on, get yourself aboard.

539
00:34:35,726 --> 00:34:37,956
Not very friendly, are they?

540
00:34:37,995 --> 00:34:39,792
What are you lookin' at?

541
00:34:45,636 --> 00:34:47,297
So now all the clans are here...

542
00:34:47,338 --> 00:34:50,068
we'll head North on the next tide.

543
00:34:51,876 --> 00:34:53,002
Ma Costa.

544
00:34:54,745 --> 00:34:57,009
This is the child?

545
00:34:59,016 --> 00:35:01,416
It's all right.

546
00:35:05,322 --> 00:35:06,687
How do you do, Lord Faa?

547
00:35:10,294 --> 00:35:12,057
Hello, Lyra.

548
00:35:13,564 --> 00:35:15,361
You come and sit by my side.

549
00:35:15,399 --> 00:35:16,457
Right, boys, get your heads up!

550
00:35:17,635 --> 00:35:19,796
This is Farder Coram.

551
00:35:19,837 --> 00:35:21,828
Head for the ice lake!

552
00:35:21,872 --> 00:35:25,831
And these are the chiefs
of the Gyptian families.

553
00:35:25,876 --> 00:35:29,334
You are our guest here,
and you're under our protection.

554
00:35:30,247 --> 00:35:31,544
Lord Faa...

555
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:34,049
I want to thank you.

556
00:35:34,084 --> 00:35:36,814
For keeping watch on me and all.

557
00:35:36,854 --> 00:35:39,152
But why did you do it?

558
00:35:39,189 --> 00:35:42,454
Lord Asriel has been
a good friend to the Gyptians...

559
00:35:42,493 --> 00:35:46,896
this many a year, and this many
a year it has been our charge...

560
00:35:46,931 --> 00:35:50,765
to bring him news of you
as we travel along our ways.

561
00:35:51,835 --> 00:35:53,962
Bet you didn't know that, did you?

562
00:35:55,272 --> 00:36:00,642
And when Mrs. Coulter
got a hold of you, well...

563
00:36:00,678 --> 00:36:03,977
we suspected that she had
something to do with the Gobblers.

564
00:36:04,014 --> 00:36:06,539
And she did.

565
00:36:06,584 --> 00:36:09,951
She and them Gobblers
took my little boy Billy.

566
00:36:11,422 --> 00:36:13,322
Lyra.

567
00:36:13,357 --> 00:36:15,621
We know your tale
all the way up until...

568
00:36:15,659 --> 00:36:18,628
you run away
and the Costas found you.

569
00:36:18,662 --> 00:36:22,154
But is there anything else
you can tell us?

570
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:25,100
Is there anything
you may have forgot?

571
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,765
Don't show it to them.

572
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:32,207
The Master of Jordan gave me this.

573
00:36:34,578 --> 00:36:38,309
I thought they was
all taken by the Magisterium.

574
00:36:43,554 --> 00:36:45,419
It's an alethiometer.

575
00:36:45,456 --> 00:36:47,481
It's a truth measurer.

576
00:36:47,524 --> 00:36:49,924
A golden compass.

577
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:54,590
It enables you to see
what others wish to hide.

578
00:36:54,632 --> 00:36:58,534
You got three hands
you can control.

579
00:36:58,569 --> 00:37:02,027
By pointing at three symbols...

580
00:37:02,072 --> 00:37:05,701
you can ask any sort of question
you can imagine.

581
00:37:07,177 --> 00:37:09,372
Once you got your question framed...

582
00:37:09,413 --> 00:37:12,644
this blue needle points
to more symbols...

583
00:37:12,683 --> 00:37:14,617
that give you the answer.

584
00:37:14,652 --> 00:37:17,212
Could it be used
to find the missing children?

585
00:37:17,254 --> 00:37:18,778
Not by me.

586
00:37:18,822 --> 00:37:20,653
The art was jealously guarded.

587
00:37:20,691 --> 00:37:21,680
Can I try?

588
00:37:24,995 --> 00:37:25,984
All right.

589
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,520
What are you doing, Lyra?

590
00:37:27,564 --> 00:37:28,861
You don't know how to read it.

591
00:37:28,899 --> 00:37:30,594
Hush, Pan.

592
00:37:32,603 --> 00:37:37,734
Well, the serpent is cunning,
like the Gobblers.

593
00:37:37,775 --> 00:37:41,404
And...the pot could mean
a recipe or a plan.

594
00:37:41,445 --> 00:37:43,310
And...

595
00:37:43,347 --> 00:37:44,814
the baby...

596
00:37:44,848 --> 00:37:47,373
that means kids.

597
00:37:47,418 --> 00:37:49,215
One thing I do know, Lyra...

598
00:37:49,253 --> 00:37:52,450
you mustn't grasp at the answer.

599
00:37:52,489 --> 00:37:56,186
Hold the question
in your mind, but lightly.

600
00:37:56,226 --> 00:37:58,820
Like it was something alive.

601
00:38:28,792 --> 00:38:31,283
It's an hourglass.

602
00:38:31,328 --> 00:38:34,525
But it came round to it
on the second time.

603
00:38:34,565 --> 00:38:37,966
The first time it only
stopped there a moment.

604
00:38:39,136 --> 00:38:42,071
On top of the hourglass...

605
00:38:42,106 --> 00:38:43,835
there's a skull.

606
00:38:50,414 --> 00:38:53,281
Thank you, children.
Finish your letters now.

607
00:39:01,959 --> 00:39:05,952
Billy Costa,
why didn't you write anything?

608
00:39:05,996 --> 00:39:07,827
Your mother must be
missing you terribly.

609
00:39:09,366 --> 00:39:12,426
I don't know what to put
in the letter, miss.

610
00:39:12,469 --> 00:39:14,300
You haven't told us
what we're here for.

611
00:39:14,338 --> 00:39:16,636
You're here to help us.

612
00:39:16,673 --> 00:39:20,268
And just as soon as you've helped us,
we'll send you back home.

613
00:39:21,278 --> 00:39:22,905
That's what you should write.

614
00:39:22,946 --> 00:39:25,506
Or don't they teach
Gyptian children to write?

615
00:39:26,316 --> 00:39:29,149
They teach us
to write the truth, miss.

616
00:39:30,187 --> 00:39:32,917
Billy, just write the letter.

617
00:39:32,956 --> 00:39:37,017
Well, as I'll be posting
these straight away...

618
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:39,722
I'm afraid your parents
will be disappointed.

619
00:39:47,805 --> 00:39:52,003
I confess I am puzzled
by your interest in the Belacqua girl.

620
00:39:52,042 --> 00:39:55,534
For one thing, she is
in possession of the alethiometer.

621
00:39:55,579 --> 00:39:58,377
How--? Ah, yes. The Master.

622
00:40:01,685 --> 00:40:02,845
Can she read it?

623
00:40:03,387 --> 00:40:05,582
Of course not.

624
00:40:05,622 --> 00:40:07,556
Mrs. Coulter...

625
00:40:07,591 --> 00:40:10,287
are you familiar with
the prophesies of the witches?

626
00:40:10,327 --> 00:40:12,887
You think she is that child?

627
00:40:13,864 --> 00:40:14,853
Impossible.

628
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:18,397
Nonetheless, she must be found.

629
00:40:26,276 --> 00:40:28,710
They'll seek her out
like bees to honey.

630
00:41:01,912 --> 00:41:03,504
Svalbard.

631
00:41:04,982 --> 00:41:06,779
Kingdom of the ice bears.

632
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:12,914
We shall have
to watch ourselves, Stelmaria.

633
00:41:12,956 --> 00:41:14,423
You can bet
that Coulter woman has hired...

634
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:18,155
every Samoyed bandit from here
to the Pole to hunt us down.

635
00:42:26,296 --> 00:42:27,923
Let's not be so hasty.

636
00:42:27,965 --> 00:42:29,193
Why don't we just--

637
00:42:29,232 --> 00:42:31,200
We can work this out
like gentlemen.

638
00:43:01,231 --> 00:43:03,028
Don't worry, Lyra.

639
00:43:03,066 --> 00:43:04,727
We'll find Roger.

640
00:43:37,834 --> 00:43:39,392
I'm all right.

641
00:43:41,571 --> 00:43:42,936
What is it?

642
00:43:42,973 --> 00:43:44,668
It's a spy-fly.

643
00:43:44,708 --> 00:43:46,175
Is it dangerous?

644
00:43:47,544 --> 00:43:50,274
The one that got away is.

645
00:43:50,313 --> 00:43:52,645
If you was to crack it open...

646
00:43:52,682 --> 00:43:55,242
you'd find no living thing in there.

647
00:43:55,285 --> 00:43:57,753
No animal or insect, at any rate.

648
00:43:57,788 --> 00:43:59,722
There's a clockwork...

649
00:43:59,756 --> 00:44:03,624
and pinned to the spring of it
is a bad spirit...

650
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:06,424
with a sleeping poison in its sting.

651
00:44:07,664 --> 00:44:10,394
We'll keep him safe in here.

652
00:44:11,735 --> 00:44:14,226
What was it after?

653
00:44:14,271 --> 00:44:16,239
- You, Lyra.
- Why me?

654
00:44:16,273 --> 00:44:18,070
Why are they doing this?

655
00:44:18,108 --> 00:44:19,871
We don't know.

656
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:21,707
But we Gyptians...

657
00:44:21,745 --> 00:44:25,476
have been hurt worse than most
by these Gobblers...

658
00:44:25,515 --> 00:44:28,416
these child-thieves.

659
00:44:28,452 --> 00:44:30,943
They're takin' those children up North...

660
00:44:30,987 --> 00:44:34,115
the land of cold and dark...

661
00:44:34,157 --> 00:44:37,786
and what they're doing
with them there, we don't know...

662
00:44:37,828 --> 00:44:40,592
but we have heard terrible rumor.

663
00:44:42,632 --> 00:44:44,463
Our aim...

664
00:44:44,501 --> 00:44:48,232
is first to go North
and to rescue these children...

665
00:44:48,271 --> 00:44:51,604
both Gyptian and landloper alike.

666
00:44:54,744 --> 00:44:58,942
But if they have been harmed...

667
00:44:58,982 --> 00:45:01,041
I promise you...

668
00:45:01,084 --> 00:45:03,951
if they have been harmed...

669
00:45:03,987 --> 00:45:08,481
there is not a place
nor on land nor on sea...

670
00:45:08,525 --> 00:45:10,288
for these Gobblers.

671
00:45:10,327 --> 00:45:13,296
And when the time comes to punish...

672
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:19,462
we will strike such a blow as'll make
their hearts faint and fearful.

673
00:45:19,503 --> 00:45:20,527
Yes!

674
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:24,028
We will strike the strength
out of them.

675
00:45:24,074 --> 00:45:28,841
We will leave them
broken and shattered.

676
00:45:28,879 --> 00:45:29,937
Yes!

677
00:45:46,663 --> 00:45:48,631
Are you getting scared, Pan?

678
00:45:48,665 --> 00:45:50,462
Scared?

679
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,990
A little.

680
00:45:53,336 --> 00:45:56,032
It's all bigger and scarier
than we ever thought.

681
00:45:56,072 --> 00:45:59,235
Maybe we shouldn't be doing this.

682
00:45:59,276 --> 00:46:02,837
But we've got to, though, ain't we?

683
00:46:02,879 --> 00:46:04,710
Go on, I mean.

684
00:46:12,722 --> 00:46:14,587
Who are you?

685
00:46:15,659 --> 00:46:17,957
My name is Serafina Pekkala...

686
00:46:17,994 --> 00:46:20,792
clan-queen of the witches
of Lake Enara.

687
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:22,161
A witch?

688
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:24,190
Where's your dæmon?

689
00:46:24,234 --> 00:46:27,260
Kaisa can fly a long way from me.

690
00:46:28,605 --> 00:46:30,835
Are you the girl
the Magisterium seeks?

691
00:46:30,874 --> 00:46:32,842
The one with a symbol reader?

692
00:46:37,948 --> 00:46:39,779
Let me see you read it.

693
00:46:39,816 --> 00:46:42,011
I want to know
if you can tell me...

694
00:46:42,052 --> 00:46:45,385
which of the men
on this ship was once...

695
00:46:45,422 --> 00:46:46,855
my lover.

696
00:47:15,785 --> 00:47:17,082
Farder Coram?

697
00:47:18,121 --> 00:47:19,349
But--

698
00:47:19,389 --> 00:47:21,983
He was young and beautiful once.

699
00:47:22,025 --> 00:47:25,392
And we witches live
for hundreds of years.

700
00:47:25,428 --> 00:47:27,259
Farder Coram wishes to know...

701
00:47:27,297 --> 00:47:29,765
where the child-cutters
take their prey.

702
00:47:29,799 --> 00:47:32,427
It is a place...

703
00:47:32,469 --> 00:47:34,664
they call Bolvangar.

704
00:47:34,704 --> 00:47:36,433
The place of fear.

705
00:47:36,473 --> 00:47:40,239
A regiment of Tartars
with wolf dæmons guards it.

706
00:47:40,277 --> 00:47:42,404
Birds do not fly above.

707
00:47:42,445 --> 00:47:43,912
Animals have fled.

708
00:47:43,947 --> 00:47:46,575
Even the Samoyeds fear it.

709
00:47:48,118 --> 00:47:52,111
It is a week's march from Trollesund,
on the coast of Norroway.

710
00:47:52,155 --> 00:47:55,181
You will find something
to help you in Trollesund.

711
00:47:55,225 --> 00:47:57,489
You will need all your courage.

712
00:47:59,529 --> 00:48:02,259
I'm glad I've lived long enough
to see you...

713
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,095
child.

714
00:48:44,941 --> 00:48:47,466
Who's going to help us?

715
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:49,535
Can you see anything?

716
00:48:49,579 --> 00:48:52,104
Lyra, you're not listening to me.

717
00:49:04,394 --> 00:49:07,022
That's a mighty fancy
clockwork you got there.

718
00:49:09,499 --> 00:49:11,194
It's just a toy.

719
00:49:13,002 --> 00:49:15,527
Well, then,
it's a mighty fancy toy.

720
00:49:19,442 --> 00:49:21,342
How'd you come by somethin' like that?

721
00:49:21,378 --> 00:49:25,576
Oh, Lord. Lee, when you gonna learn
to mind your own business?

722
00:49:26,616 --> 00:49:28,413
I do beg pardon.

723
00:49:28,451 --> 00:49:30,112
Lee Scoresby.

724
00:49:30,153 --> 00:49:31,745
And this old gal is Hester.

725
00:49:33,123 --> 00:49:35,557
I'm Lyra. And this is Pan.

726
00:49:35,592 --> 00:49:36,923
Pantalaimon.

727
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,622
- Howdy.
- Mighty pleased, Miss Lyra.

728
00:49:40,697 --> 00:49:44,189
You rode in with them Gyptian fellers.
Am I right?

729
00:49:44,234 --> 00:49:46,361
- Whoa, boy.
- There I go again.

730
00:49:46,403 --> 00:49:47,768
Don't answer that.

731
00:49:47,804 --> 00:49:51,296
What are you doing
in Trollesund, Mr. Scoresby?

732
00:49:51,341 --> 00:49:54,868
Oh, a friend of mine
got himself in a fix.

733
00:49:54,911 --> 00:49:57,209
So I come to see
what I could do about it.

734
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,714
Me too.

735
00:49:58,748 --> 00:50:00,978
Course, that ain't
my normal occupation.

736
00:50:01,017 --> 00:50:05,351
Most of the time,
I ply my trade up in the sky.

737
00:50:06,423 --> 00:50:07,890
You're an aeronaut!

738
00:50:09,426 --> 00:50:11,326
Can I go up in your ship?

739
00:50:11,361 --> 00:50:13,556
I'd be honored.

740
00:50:13,596 --> 00:50:15,587
Just as soon as
I get her out of hock.

741
00:50:17,901 --> 00:50:19,334
Miss Lyra...

742
00:50:20,403 --> 00:50:22,564
I'd like to give you
a word of advice...

743
00:50:22,605 --> 00:50:25,199
though you ain't asked for none.

744
00:50:25,241 --> 00:50:28,005
If I was on the kinda...scout...

745
00:50:28,044 --> 00:50:30,569
that I reckon you're on...

746
00:50:30,613 --> 00:50:33,878
I'd hire myself an aeronaut...

747
00:50:33,917 --> 00:50:35,509
and an armoured bear.

748
00:50:35,552 --> 00:50:37,679
An armoured bear?

749
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:40,211
There's one in town.

750
00:50:40,256 --> 00:50:42,588
lorek Byrnison's his name.

751
00:50:42,625 --> 00:50:46,152
Works at the sled depot
behind Einarsson's Bar.

752
00:50:46,196 --> 00:50:48,926
Good one to have
on your side in a scrap.

753
00:50:50,066 --> 00:50:51,897
Not that you're lookin' for that.

754
00:51:03,379 --> 00:51:07,008
lorek Byrnison? lorek Byrnison?

755
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:10,417
May I speak to you?

756
00:51:12,522 --> 00:51:13,614
What?

757
00:51:13,656 --> 00:51:15,988
We want to offer you employment.

758
00:51:16,025 --> 00:51:20,291
I am employed, by the townspeople.

759
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:22,855
I mend broken machinery.

760
00:51:22,899 --> 00:51:25,891
I lift heavy objects.

761
00:51:25,935 --> 00:51:29,393
What kind of work is that
for a Panserbjørn?

762
00:51:31,474 --> 00:51:33,169
Paid work!

763
00:51:54,264 --> 00:51:56,459
Is that what they pay you?

764
00:51:56,499 --> 00:51:57,830
Whisky?

765
00:51:59,435 --> 00:52:00,766
lorek Byrnison...

766
00:52:00,803 --> 00:52:04,000
you're the first ice bear I ever met.

767
00:52:05,241 --> 00:52:07,709
I was ever so excited,
and scared.

768
00:52:08,912 --> 00:52:11,176
But now I'm just disappointed.

769
00:52:11,214 --> 00:52:14,012
I heard that bears
lived to hunt and to fight.

770
00:52:15,118 --> 00:52:17,177
Why are you
wasting your time here...

771
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:18,710
drinking whisky?

772
00:52:20,523 --> 00:52:24,516
I stay because
the people of this town...

773
00:52:24,561 --> 00:52:26,119
gave me spirits...

774
00:52:26,162 --> 00:52:28,926
and let me drink till I was asleep.

775
00:52:28,965 --> 00:52:31,798
Then they took my armour away.

776
00:52:31,834 --> 00:52:35,031
And without my armour,
I cannot go to war.

777
00:52:35,071 --> 00:52:39,007
And I am an armoured bear.

778
00:52:39,042 --> 00:52:42,478
War is the sea I swim in...

779
00:52:42,512 --> 00:52:45,242
the air I breathe.

780
00:52:45,281 --> 00:52:49,081
Without my armour, I am nothing.

781
00:52:49,118 --> 00:52:53,077
But...can't you make new armour?

782
00:52:53,122 --> 00:52:56,182
I thought bears were good at that.

783
00:52:56,225 --> 00:52:58,090
There's all this metal around.

784
00:52:58,127 --> 00:53:00,095
Worthless!

785
00:53:01,864 --> 00:53:04,958
My armour is made of sky iron...

786
00:53:05,001 --> 00:53:08,994
from the falling stars
that land in Svalbard.

787
00:53:09,038 --> 00:53:12,474
A bear's armour is his soul...

788
00:53:12,508 --> 00:53:15,500
as your dæmon is your soul.

789
00:53:15,545 --> 00:53:17,103
Irreplaceable.

790
00:53:17,146 --> 00:53:20,707
You may as well take him away
and replace him with a doll.

791
00:53:22,452 --> 00:53:25,785
It must have been terrible
to lose your armour.

792
00:53:25,822 --> 00:53:28,757
It was no less than I deserved.

793
00:53:29,926 --> 00:53:31,791
I am an exile.

794
00:53:31,828 --> 00:53:36,822
I was sent away from Svalbard
because I was unworthy.

795
00:53:36,866 --> 00:53:40,199
I fought another bear
in single combat...

796
00:53:40,236 --> 00:53:42,932
and was defeated.

797
00:53:51,381 --> 00:53:53,815
- Come, child.
- But Farder Coram--

798
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:55,943
We can't involve ourselves.

799
00:54:25,782 --> 00:54:27,750
He was a prince.

800
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:32,977
He would have been a king
if the other bear hadn't defeated him.

801
00:54:33,022 --> 00:54:35,217
He lost everything.

802
00:54:35,258 --> 00:54:38,056
Oh, Pan, they've really hurt him.

803
00:54:41,431 --> 00:54:45,060
lorek Byrnison? lorek Byrnison.

804
00:54:46,436 --> 00:54:49,530
- Be careful.
- I know where your armour is.

805
00:54:52,041 --> 00:54:54,339
They tricked you out of it.

806
00:54:54,377 --> 00:54:56,345
They shouldn't have done that,
lorek Byrnison.

807
00:54:56,379 --> 00:55:00,748
It's in the district office
of the Magisterium.

808
00:55:00,783 --> 00:55:03,217
Right here in Trollesund.

809
00:55:03,252 --> 00:55:05,948
What is your name, child?

810
00:55:05,988 --> 00:55:07,751
Lyra Belacqua.

811
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:11,351
Then, Lyra Belacqua...

812
00:55:11,394 --> 00:55:13,862
I owe you a debt.

813
00:55:13,896 --> 00:55:16,626
I will serve you in your campaign...

814
00:55:16,666 --> 00:55:18,793
until I am dead...

815
00:55:18,835 --> 00:55:22,066
or you have a victory.

816
00:56:17,827 --> 00:56:19,158
lorek!

817
00:56:20,263 --> 00:56:22,754
lorek Byrnison!

818
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:26,257
lorek, listen.
Don't fight these men.

819
00:56:26,302 --> 00:56:28,429
What they done ain't right, I know.

820
00:56:28,471 --> 00:56:30,496
But if you fight, you'll kill them.

821
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:31,905
And there'll be more fighting...

822
00:56:31,941 --> 00:56:33,875
and we'll never get away
to rescue those kids.

823
00:56:39,682 --> 00:56:42,082
Let's not be too hasty.

824
00:56:42,118 --> 00:56:45,451
Way I see it,
there's no need for a dust-up.

825
00:56:47,123 --> 00:56:50,524
Howdy, lorek.
I was down South.

826
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:53,461
Heard you ran into
a little local trouble.

827
00:56:53,496 --> 00:56:56,897
Didn't have the first notion
on how to spring ya.

828
00:56:56,933 --> 00:56:58,423
Fortunately, little girls...

829
00:56:58,467 --> 00:57:00,697
come in real resourceful
up in these parts.

830
00:57:03,973 --> 00:57:07,204
Well, looky here. Reinforcements.

831
00:57:09,078 --> 00:57:12,241
What do you say you fellers
just call it a day?

832
00:57:16,385 --> 00:57:19,411
Just been hired on
by these gentlemen...

833
00:57:19,455 --> 00:57:22,390
of the Gyptian persuasion.

834
00:57:22,425 --> 00:57:24,916
You figurin' on joining
this turkey shoot?

835
00:57:24,961 --> 00:57:28,522
Yes. I have a contract
with the child.

836
00:57:31,267 --> 00:57:34,100
That's some pretty
fast work, Miss Lyra.

837
00:57:56,425 --> 00:57:58,416
My lord.

838
00:58:01,163 --> 00:58:04,257
Rise, Fra Pavel.

839
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:06,097
I have received your news...

840
00:58:06,135 --> 00:58:10,538
about the Gyptian party
heading to the North.

841
00:58:10,573 --> 00:58:12,700
The matter is of
the first importance.

842
00:58:12,742 --> 00:58:16,109
They must be eliminated,
and Bolvangar protected.

843
00:58:17,546 --> 00:58:21,710
The intercision process is
more important than ever.

844
00:58:21,751 --> 00:58:24,584
Which is why it must be
taken out of the hands...

845
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:26,918
of the Coulter woman.

846
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:35,220
It was Mrs. Coulter
who took the Belacqua child...

847
00:58:35,264 --> 00:58:37,926
from Jordan College
and then let her slip away.

848
00:58:37,967 --> 00:58:40,959
Yes, that is
the most troubling of all.

849
00:58:42,204 --> 00:58:45,435
No matter.
One way or another...

850
00:58:45,474 --> 00:58:47,874
it's better that I've sent
Mrs. Coulter after the child.

851
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:50,242
- You've sent her?
- Yes.

852
00:58:50,279 --> 00:58:52,645
She is to demonstrate
the improvements...

853
00:58:52,682 --> 00:58:56,550
to the intercision process
upon the Belacqua girl.

854
00:59:20,609 --> 00:59:23,339
I'm sorry.

855
00:59:30,052 --> 00:59:32,612
I would never hurt you.

856
00:59:38,728 --> 00:59:40,719
Oh, Lyra.

857
00:59:42,965 --> 00:59:45,559
I'll find you.

858
00:59:45,601 --> 00:59:48,365
I will find you.

859
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:07,445
Careful now, boys.

860
01:00:07,490 --> 01:00:11,051
Airship machinery's kind of finicky.

861
01:00:11,093 --> 01:00:14,551
I want to die in a rocking chair,
not a hydrogen fire.

862
01:00:14,597 --> 01:00:17,065
And she was ever so clever,
Mrs. Coulter...

863
01:00:17,099 --> 01:00:19,090
but she was always
telling me what to do.

864
01:00:19,135 --> 01:00:21,160
I don't like people
telling me what to do.

865
01:00:21,203 --> 01:00:23,865
I bet you don't like it either.
I can tell.

866
01:00:23,906 --> 01:00:25,874
You're like my Uncle Asriel.

867
01:00:25,908 --> 01:00:29,002
He's a rough noble like you.
That's what I think.

868
01:00:36,185 --> 01:00:39,086
Samoyed lands.

869
01:00:39,121 --> 01:00:42,716
Samoyeds don't take
kindly to trespassers.

870
01:00:42,758 --> 01:00:45,852
It's the only way
to reach Bolvangar.

871
01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:50,990
Stay close to me.

872
01:00:51,033 --> 01:00:54,059
- Come, child.
- It will be dark soon.

873
01:01:03,112 --> 01:01:05,580
How far do you reckon?

874
01:01:05,614 --> 01:01:08,276
Oh, I don't know for sure,
but a good few miles.

875
01:01:08,317 --> 01:01:11,047
We covered some ground.

876
01:01:33,008 --> 01:01:36,409
What's wrong?
What can you see?

877
01:01:42,384 --> 01:01:44,249
- Where are we going?
- Hush, Pan.

878
01:01:44,286 --> 01:01:46,186
They told us not to leave the tent.

879
01:01:46,222 --> 01:01:47,519
Is he coming, then?

880
01:01:47,556 --> 01:01:50,821
Don't know. I'll have a look.

881
01:02:06,709 --> 01:02:07,971
lorek?

882
01:02:08,010 --> 01:02:10,945
What is it, child?

883
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:14,211
The alethiometer keeps
telling me something.

884
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:17,777
In the next valley,
there's a lake with a house by it...

885
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:20,084
and it's troubled by a ghost.

886
01:02:20,122 --> 01:02:23,614
It's something to do
with the Gobblers and Roger.

887
01:02:23,659 --> 01:02:27,288
You could take me there,
couldn't you?

888
01:02:27,329 --> 01:02:29,229
You could carry me
there and back...

889
01:02:29,265 --> 01:02:31,096
before anyone knew,
couldn't you?

890
01:02:31,967 --> 01:02:35,459
You wish to ride me?

891
01:02:35,504 --> 01:02:37,438
Yeah.

892
01:02:37,473 --> 01:02:40,601
We will travel faster without armour.

893
01:03:15,444 --> 01:03:17,639
Are those birds?

894
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:19,341
Witches.

895
01:03:20,983 --> 01:03:23,110
More than I have ever seen.

896
01:03:23,152 --> 01:03:25,143
Where are they going?

897
01:03:25,187 --> 01:03:27,985
Flying to war.

898
01:03:29,258 --> 01:03:31,351
If they are flying
to the aid of your enemies...

899
01:03:31,393 --> 01:03:33,623
you should all be afraid.

900
01:03:34,330 --> 01:03:36,025
Are you afraid?

901
01:03:36,065 --> 01:03:37,862
No.

902
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:41,563
When I am, I will master my fear.

903
01:04:09,932 --> 01:04:12,492
I will make sure the way is clear.

904
01:04:12,534 --> 01:04:15,196
No. Stay here.

905
01:04:37,059 --> 01:04:39,789
Lyra, no, please don't.

906
01:04:39,828 --> 01:04:41,796
Something's wrong.

907
01:04:41,830 --> 01:04:45,288
- Hush, Pan.
- Something terrible.

908
01:04:45,334 --> 01:04:47,768
I'm afraid.

909
01:04:47,803 --> 01:04:50,363
We've got to master our fear.

910
01:05:12,194 --> 01:05:14,389
Hello?

911
01:05:14,430 --> 01:05:16,421
Hello?

912
01:05:40,789 --> 01:05:43,019
Billy.

913
01:05:43,058 --> 01:05:45,424
Where's his dæmon?

914
01:05:45,461 --> 01:05:48,225
He doesn't have a dæmon.

915
01:05:48,263 --> 01:05:50,128
That's...

916
01:05:50,165 --> 01:05:51,826
intercision.

917
01:05:53,669 --> 01:05:56,433
That's what
the Gobblers are doing--

918
01:05:58,941 --> 01:06:01,501
cuttin' away kids' dæmons.

919
01:06:02,878 --> 01:06:04,778
Where's my Ratter?

920
01:06:04,813 --> 01:06:06,838
Have you seen her?

921
01:06:08,917 --> 01:06:10,885
Billy, it's me, Lyra.

922
01:06:10,919 --> 01:06:13,888
Let me take you
back to your mum.

923
01:06:13,922 --> 01:06:15,981
I need Ratter.

924
01:06:16,024 --> 01:06:18,686
Billy, come on with me.

925
01:06:18,727 --> 01:06:20,854
We'll take you someplace safe.

926
01:06:20,896 --> 01:06:22,557
We'll find Ratter.

927
01:06:39,248 --> 01:06:41,716
Gracious God, what's this?

928
01:06:44,119 --> 01:06:47,680
Lyra, child,
what have you found?

929
01:06:47,723 --> 01:06:51,386
Billy. Billy Costa.

930
01:06:51,427 --> 01:06:52,860
Billy!

931
01:06:56,098 --> 01:06:58,259
Oh, Billy!
You're all right, Billy.

932
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:00,530
You're safe now.

933
01:07:01,437 --> 01:07:02,665
We'll find your dæmon.

934
01:07:02,704 --> 01:07:05,537
We'll bring 'er back.

935
01:07:21,490 --> 01:07:25,392
Here, take Lyra.
Gyptians, to arms!

936
01:07:34,636 --> 01:07:36,501
- Watch your backs!
- Protect the children!

937
01:07:49,585 --> 01:07:51,280
Look out, Lyra!

938
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:03,324
lorek!

939
01:08:03,699 --> 01:08:06,463
lorek Byrnison, help me!

940
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:27,348
Pan, where are they taking us?

941
01:08:27,389 --> 01:08:29,357
I don't know.
We've been going for hours.

942
01:08:42,971 --> 01:08:44,939
Ice bears, Pan.

943
01:08:47,009 --> 01:08:49,170
I hope you're happy now.

944
01:09:03,659 --> 01:09:06,457
You're losing your touch, amigo.

945
01:09:07,296 --> 01:09:08,786
So am I.

946
01:09:08,830 --> 01:09:11,230
Don't worry.

947
01:09:11,266 --> 01:09:12,961
We'll get her back.

948
01:09:14,236 --> 01:09:17,637
The Samoyeds
won't lay a hand on her.

949
01:09:17,673 --> 01:09:20,107
She's worth more in one piece.

950
01:09:23,579 --> 01:09:25,774
I'll find her.

951
01:09:25,814 --> 01:09:29,306
I'll bring her back.
I can bargain with Ragnar.

952
01:09:30,886 --> 01:09:34,151
I'll drop you at the border,
pick you up on the way out.

953
01:09:34,189 --> 01:09:37,158
No. I will not leave her.

954
01:09:39,695 --> 01:09:41,754
You show up in Svalbard...

955
01:09:41,797 --> 01:09:43,788
Ragnar and the rest of 'em
will tear you to pieces.

956
01:09:43,832 --> 01:09:45,390
You know that.

957
01:09:45,434 --> 01:09:47,459
I know I would feel ashamed...

958
01:09:47,502 --> 01:09:50,198
to show less courage
than that child.

959
01:09:50,238 --> 01:09:53,264
That kind of courage
could get you killed.

960
01:09:53,308 --> 01:09:57,540
I will not live in shame
any longer, Scoresby.

961
01:09:59,047 --> 01:10:00,708
No.

962
01:10:01,984 --> 01:10:03,975
I reckon not.

963
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:08,121
I'm gonna take her down,
pick up the trail.

964
01:10:16,298 --> 01:10:18,266
Don't worry. lorek will come.

965
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:23,363
That's just it, Pan.
There's too many of them for him to fight.

966
01:10:28,677 --> 01:10:30,770
We've got to do something.

967
01:10:34,449 --> 01:10:38,886
Do you remember
what Mrs. Coulter said back at Jordan...

968
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:42,048
about the king of the bears
wanting a dæmon?

969
01:10:44,793 --> 01:10:47,455
Pan, I need you to hide.

970
01:10:47,496 --> 01:10:50,795
- Don't let them see you.
- That's fine with me.

971
01:10:50,832 --> 01:10:53,562
We can beat him, Pan.

972
01:11:05,247 --> 01:11:08,341
What is this little thing?

973
01:11:09,651 --> 01:11:12,779
Our greetings to you, great king.

974
01:11:12,821 --> 01:11:16,848
Or rather, my greetings and not his.

975
01:11:16,892 --> 01:11:19,087
Not whose?

976
01:11:19,127 --> 01:11:21,925
lorek Byrnison's, Your Majesty.

977
01:11:21,963 --> 01:11:26,491
What have you
to do with lorek Byrnison?

978
01:11:29,671 --> 01:11:32,105
I am lorek Byrnison's dæmon.

979
01:11:35,377 --> 01:11:37,777
And how has the exile...

980
01:11:37,813 --> 01:11:41,544
the unworthy lorek Byrnison,
obtained a dæmon?

981
01:11:41,583 --> 01:11:44,609
lorek Byrnison was
the first bear to get a dæmon...

982
01:11:44,653 --> 01:11:46,382
but it should've been you.

983
01:11:46,421 --> 01:11:50,221
They gave me to him at Bolvangar.
Mrs. Coulter did.

984
01:11:50,258 --> 01:11:53,955
And how could you be
so far from him?

985
01:11:53,995 --> 01:11:56,463
I'm like a witch's dæmon, great king.

986
01:11:56,498 --> 01:12:00,229
- I can go as far from him as I please.
- Well...

987
01:12:00,268 --> 01:12:02,202
if you are his dæmon...

988
01:12:02,237 --> 01:12:06,196
then I will kill you right now
and be free of an enemy.

989
01:12:06,241 --> 01:12:08,801
If you do that,
I can never be your dæmon.

990
01:12:09,745 --> 01:12:12,305
My...dæmon?

991
01:12:12,347 --> 01:12:14,679
That's why I come here, see?

992
01:12:14,716 --> 01:12:17,184
'Cause I want to be
your dæmon, not his.

993
01:12:17,219 --> 01:12:20,211
He's just an exile, nothing.

994
01:12:20,255 --> 01:12:23,782
But you, you're powerful
and clever and rich...

995
01:12:23,825 --> 01:12:27,022
and better in every way.

996
01:12:27,062 --> 01:12:30,088
He's on his way here now,
to fight you.

997
01:12:30,132 --> 01:12:32,965
What? He's mad.

998
01:12:33,001 --> 01:12:35,492
- We shall destroy him!
- No.

999
01:12:35,537 --> 01:12:37,027
No.

1000
01:12:37,773 --> 01:12:41,004
If you defeat him,
I will become your dæmon.

1001
01:12:41,042 --> 01:12:43,772
But you must defeat him
in single combat.

1002
01:12:43,812 --> 01:12:47,748
Then all his strength
will flow into yours...

1003
01:12:47,783 --> 01:12:52,117
and my mind will flow
into your mind.

1004
01:12:52,154 --> 01:12:54,588
You and me, together.

1005
01:12:56,658 --> 01:12:59,092
Have him killed any other way...

1006
01:12:59,127 --> 01:13:02,255
and I'll just go out like a light,
and you'll never have a dæmon.

1007
01:13:02,297 --> 01:13:04,595
Prove it.

1008
01:13:04,633 --> 01:13:07,898
Prove to me that you are a dæmon.

1009
01:13:07,936 --> 01:13:10,496
Ask me something only you know.

1010
01:13:13,542 --> 01:13:16,102
How did I become king?

1011
01:13:25,353 --> 01:13:27,344
What is that?

1012
01:13:27,389 --> 01:13:29,755
It's a dæmon mirror, great king.

1013
01:13:29,791 --> 01:13:33,591
We dæmons use it to see
the truth in our own eyes.

1014
01:13:55,250 --> 01:13:58,981
Truly you are great
and powerful, Ragnar...

1015
01:13:59,020 --> 01:14:01,488
for you poisoned the old king...

1016
01:14:01,523 --> 01:14:05,050
then challenged the heir to the throne
and beat him in single combat.

1017
01:14:07,596 --> 01:14:09,826
lorek Byrnison.

1018
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:34,081
Oh, Pan, what have I done?

1019
01:14:34,122 --> 01:14:35,851
Ragnar's too strong.

1020
01:14:41,663 --> 01:14:43,790
So here he is.

1021
01:14:43,832 --> 01:14:46,528
But what if the coward
dare not fight me?

1022
01:14:46,568 --> 01:14:49,503
Great king, let me speak to him.

1023
01:14:49,537 --> 01:14:52,165
- If I do, he will not suspect.
- Very well.

1024
01:14:52,207 --> 01:14:54,903
You go to him. Give him courage.

1025
01:14:54,943 --> 01:14:57,503
Bring him to his death.

1026
01:14:57,545 --> 01:15:00,446
Soon you'll be mine.

1027
01:15:12,827 --> 01:15:14,624
Oh, lorek.

1028
01:15:14,663 --> 01:15:17,393
lorek, dear,
I've done a terrible thing.

1029
01:15:17,432 --> 01:15:20,868
What terrible thing?

1030
01:15:23,004 --> 01:15:26,496
I told the king I was your dæmon
and that he must fight you.

1031
01:15:26,541 --> 01:15:28,509
If not, they would never let you fight.

1032
01:15:28,543 --> 01:15:30,568
They would burn you
before you even got up close.

1033
01:15:31,780 --> 01:15:33,372
But you've been fighting...

1034
01:15:33,415 --> 01:15:35,246
and running all this way.

1035
01:15:35,283 --> 01:15:39,151
Lyra. Lyra Belacqua.

1036
01:15:39,187 --> 01:15:43,521
No, I shall call you
Lyra Silvertongue.

1037
01:15:43,558 --> 01:15:47,221
To fight him is all I want.

1038
01:15:47,262 --> 01:15:50,254
Come, little dæmon.

1039
01:15:58,473 --> 01:16:00,441
Fight well, lorek, my dear.

1040
01:16:00,475 --> 01:16:02,739
You're the real king,
and he ain't nothing.

1041
01:16:02,777 --> 01:16:05,974
Lyra, if I am killed...

1042
01:16:06,014 --> 01:16:08,107
Scoresby will find you.

1043
01:17:51,086 --> 01:17:53,418
Is that all...

1044
01:17:53,455 --> 01:17:55,013
whimpering cub?

1045
01:17:55,056 --> 01:17:57,149
Is that all...

1046
01:17:57,192 --> 01:17:58,819
soon-to-die?

1047
01:18:00,929 --> 01:18:04,524
Is that all? Huh?

1048
01:18:14,309 --> 01:18:16,539
Is that all?

1049
01:18:38,166 --> 01:18:41,033
Yes, that is all.

1050
01:18:41,069 --> 01:18:44,004
That is all.

1051
01:18:44,038 --> 01:18:49,704
Bears, who is your king?

1052
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:07,591
lorek...

1053
01:19:07,629 --> 01:19:10,223
lorek, I thought I'd lost you.

1054
01:19:10,265 --> 01:19:11,789
Why?

1055
01:19:11,833 --> 01:19:14,495
You still own my contract.

1056
01:19:17,238 --> 01:19:20,503
And now I will take you to Bolvangar.

1057
01:19:24,846 --> 01:19:26,711
We've got to stop them, lorek.

1058
01:19:26,748 --> 01:19:28,841
The alethiometer says
they'll hurt Roger.

1059
01:19:52,674 --> 01:19:54,141
There.

1060
01:20:11,759 --> 01:20:14,091
It may not hold us both.

1061
01:20:14,862 --> 01:20:17,558
You cross on your own.
I will follow.

1062
01:20:27,108 --> 01:20:29,804
I'm right here. Step quickly.

1063
01:20:29,844 --> 01:20:31,835
Don't look down.

1064
01:20:48,563 --> 01:20:51,657
Don't look back!
You're almost there.

1065
01:21:08,316 --> 01:21:10,079
Run, Lyra!

1066
01:21:10,118 --> 01:21:12,416
Run! Run!

1067
01:21:20,428 --> 01:21:23,693
Lyra! I will get
Scoresby and the Gyptians.

1068
01:21:26,968 --> 01:21:29,027
Wait for me there!

1069
01:21:29,070 --> 01:21:31,903
Lyra! Wait!

1070
01:21:44,786 --> 01:21:47,118
I don't like the look of this place.

1071
01:21:53,061 --> 01:21:55,256
Bolvangar.

1072
01:21:55,296 --> 01:21:57,491
Hello, there.

1073
01:21:57,532 --> 01:22:01,434
I got lost in the snow. Where am I?

1074
01:22:01,469 --> 01:22:03,369
No need to worry, my child.

1075
01:22:03,404 --> 01:22:05,304
You're safe now.

1076
01:22:13,181 --> 01:22:15,115
Well, you'd better come inside.

1077
01:22:15,149 --> 01:22:17,083
It's warm and comfortable in here.

1078
01:22:17,118 --> 01:22:20,519
- What's your name?
- Don't tell him who we are.

1079
01:22:22,090 --> 01:22:24,923
Lizzie. Lizzie Brooks.

1080
01:22:28,129 --> 01:22:30,597
What were you doing
so far north, Lizzie?

1081
01:22:30,631 --> 01:22:32,792
That must be an interesting story.

1082
01:22:32,834 --> 01:22:35,860
My dad and uncles,
they took me north.

1083
01:22:35,903 --> 01:22:37,871
They're traders.

1084
01:22:37,905 --> 01:22:42,239
Well, you're very lucky
to have found us when you got lost.

1085
01:22:42,276 --> 01:22:43,868
What is this place?

1086
01:22:43,911 --> 01:22:46,402
Oh, you'll like it.

1087
01:22:46,447 --> 01:22:48,972
It's called the Experimental Station.

1088
01:22:49,016 --> 01:22:50,881
What do you do here?

1089
01:22:50,918 --> 01:22:52,852
We help children grow up.

1090
01:22:52,887 --> 01:22:56,152
- Liar.
- You must be hungry, Lizzie. Lucky you.

1091
01:22:56,190 --> 01:22:58,488
Just in time for dinner.

1092
01:23:14,475 --> 01:23:16,705
Can you see him?
Is he here?

1093
01:23:32,226 --> 01:23:33,693
- Lyra, it's them.
- Pan!

1094
01:23:33,728 --> 01:23:35,491
- You found us!
- You're all right!

1095
01:23:35,530 --> 01:23:38,124
You kept your promise!

1096
01:23:49,377 --> 01:23:50,935
I knew you'd come.

1097
01:23:50,978 --> 01:23:52,605
I promised, didn't I?

1098
01:24:00,421 --> 01:24:03,982
Roger, do you know
what they do to the kids here?

1099
01:24:05,359 --> 01:24:08,021
They say they're gonna give us
this operation, right?

1100
01:24:08,062 --> 01:24:09,791
Then they'll send us home...

1101
01:24:09,831 --> 01:24:11,628
and we won't have
to worry about Dust.

1102
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:14,693
But once they call a kid in...

1103
01:24:14,735 --> 01:24:16,430
you'll never see them again.

1104
01:24:16,471 --> 01:24:19,269
They took Billy Costa
away last week...

1105
01:24:19,307 --> 01:24:20,672
and he's still gone.

1106
01:24:20,708 --> 01:24:23,905
Don't worry.
I've got a plan, all right?

1107
01:24:25,947 --> 01:24:29,383
Tell the kids to have
their warm clothes ready.

1108
01:24:29,417 --> 01:24:31,476
I need to be alone someplace.

1109
01:24:32,587 --> 01:24:34,282
But not here.

1110
01:24:37,758 --> 01:24:40,750
They hardly ever use this one,
but be quick.

1111
01:24:58,145 --> 01:25:00,238
Ask it how
we're gonna get out of here.

1112
01:25:03,518 --> 01:25:05,486
But why would it--

1113
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:07,545
Oh, no. It's them.

1114
01:25:07,588 --> 01:25:09,180
I think you'll be pleased with our progress.

1115
01:25:09,223 --> 01:25:12,852
That may be so,
but I am very interested in discovering...

1116
01:25:12,894 --> 01:25:16,386
how several children managed
to wander free from the station.

1117
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,627
- Thank you.
- Mrs. Coulter...

1118
01:25:20,668 --> 01:25:23,159
I hope you'll understand
that the question is moot.

1119
01:25:23,204 --> 01:25:25,900
Any child who escapes
from the facility...

1120
01:25:25,940 --> 01:25:28,033
would not last
very long in the cold.

1121
01:25:28,075 --> 01:25:30,976
We have already recovered
two of the three missing children.

1122
01:25:31,546 --> 01:25:33,207
Were they alive?

1123
01:25:37,852 --> 01:25:40,150
Well, that is unfortunate.

1124
01:25:41,022 --> 01:25:42,887
But enough of that for now.

1125
01:25:42,924 --> 01:25:45,085
I, at least, have some good news.

1126
01:25:47,094 --> 01:25:50,063
We needn't be concerned
with Lord Asriel any longer.

1127
01:25:52,667 --> 01:25:55,693
He has bribed his captors
and set up a secret laboratory...

1128
01:25:55,736 --> 01:25:58,296
in the furthest reaches
of the North.

1129
01:26:00,207 --> 01:26:03,608
The Magisterium soldiers
are on their way.

1130
01:26:03,644 --> 01:26:07,705
He will be arrested for heresy
and sentenced to death.

1131
01:26:07,748 --> 01:26:10,080
Put him to death? Dear me.

1132
01:26:13,087 --> 01:26:15,988
I think I will retire for the evening.

1133
01:26:16,023 --> 01:26:17,991
Oh, well, yes, of course.

1134
01:26:18,025 --> 01:26:20,493
The orderlies will show you
to your chambers.

1135
01:26:25,066 --> 01:26:27,398
Wouldn't want to get
on the wrong side of her. I tell you that.

1136
01:26:27,435 --> 01:26:30,063
She's positively ghoulish.

1137
01:26:30,104 --> 01:26:32,231
Do you remember
the first experiments...

1138
01:26:32,273 --> 01:26:34,537
when she was so keen
to see them pulled apart?

1139
01:26:34,575 --> 01:26:37,043
Her and that mute of a dæmon.

1140
01:26:37,078 --> 01:26:38,670
- What was that?
- Down there.

1141
01:26:38,713 --> 01:26:40,044
- Under the table.
- Quick!

1142
01:26:40,081 --> 01:26:42,015
- Lyra!
- Grab her leg!

1143
01:26:42,049 --> 01:26:43,107
Lyra, they've got me!

1144
01:26:44,819 --> 01:26:46,116
Come here.

1145
01:26:46,153 --> 01:26:48,087
- Come on.
- Lyra!

1146
01:26:50,091 --> 01:26:51,888
- You can't!
- Let me go! Get off me!

1147
01:26:51,926 --> 01:26:54,360
You're not allowed!

1148
01:26:55,763 --> 01:26:57,628
Lyra!

1149
01:27:04,238 --> 01:27:06,001
Quickly now. Straight into the chamber.

1150
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:08,838
Let me go. lorek Byrnison's gonna kill you.

1151
01:27:08,876 --> 01:27:11,071
- He'll rip your guts out!
- What a--

1152
01:27:12,413 --> 01:27:15,940
Don't fret, dear.
It's only a little cut.

1153
01:27:15,983 --> 01:27:19,282
- You'll never keep us apart.
- You want to grow up, don't you?

1154
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:22,414
- Well, this is how you grow up.
- Stay away from me!

1155
01:27:22,456 --> 01:27:25,516
- You'll never keep us apart!
- Set phase two.

1156
01:27:25,559 --> 01:27:27,618
Never, never!

1157
01:27:32,733 --> 01:27:34,428
No, stop!

1158
01:27:34,468 --> 01:27:36,595
- Lyra!
- Pan!

1159
01:27:36,637 --> 01:27:39,003
- No!
- Never!

1160
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:42,206
You can't!

1161
01:27:44,645 --> 01:27:46,476
- Don't leave me, Pan.
- No!

1162
01:27:46,514 --> 01:27:48,812
- Stop!
- No! Help me!

1163
01:27:48,849 --> 01:27:50,510
Lyra!

1164
01:27:55,389 --> 01:27:57,482
Lyra!

1165
01:28:27,121 --> 01:28:29,214
Lyra. Darling.

1166
01:28:29,256 --> 01:28:31,247
- Don't. Don't you touch.
- No, no. No, no one will hurt you.

1167
01:28:31,292 --> 01:28:34,420
No one is going to hurt you.
No one is ever...

1168
01:28:34,462 --> 01:28:36,157
ever going to hurt you.

1169
01:28:36,197 --> 01:28:39,997
They did it to Billy...

1170
01:28:40,034 --> 01:28:42,059
and those other kids.

1171
01:28:42,103 --> 01:28:44,799
They cut their dæmons away.

1172
01:28:44,839 --> 01:28:47,899
Why? Why are they doing that?

1173
01:28:47,942 --> 01:28:51,878
I know it's difficult to understand,
but it's for their own good.

1174
01:28:51,912 --> 01:28:54,039
It's just a little cut.

1175
01:28:54,081 --> 01:28:58,017
You listen. Listen to me.

1176
01:28:58,052 --> 01:29:00,418
A long, long time ago...

1177
01:29:00,454 --> 01:29:02,945
some of our ancestors made--

1178
01:29:02,990 --> 01:29:05,288
made a terrible mistake.

1179
01:29:05,326 --> 01:29:08,022
They disobeyed...

1180
01:29:08,062 --> 01:29:10,257
the Authority.

1181
01:29:10,297 --> 01:29:13,528
And that is what made Dust
come into the world.

1182
01:29:13,567 --> 01:29:17,333
And ever since then, we have been sick
with it, we have been sick with Dust.

1183
01:29:17,371 --> 01:29:19,635
But there is a way out.

1184
01:29:19,673 --> 01:29:22,335
You see, Dust doesn't settle
on innocent children.

1185
01:29:23,677 --> 01:29:28,011
It's later, when your dæmon
begins to settle...

1186
01:29:28,048 --> 01:29:30,778
that Dust begins
to swarm all around us...

1187
01:29:30,818 --> 01:29:34,379
trying to work its mischief.

1188
01:29:34,421 --> 01:29:37,788
And that is how children begin to have
all sorts of nasty thoughts...

1189
01:29:37,825 --> 01:29:40,350
and unhappy feelings and--

1190
01:29:41,962 --> 01:29:44,362
But there is a way to stop it.

1191
01:29:45,766 --> 01:29:49,361
A little cut, and gone forever.

1192
01:29:49,403 --> 01:29:52,736
Well, if it's so good,
then why don't you do it yourself?

1193
01:29:52,773 --> 01:29:54,604
Why didn't you let them do it to me?

1194
01:29:57,077 --> 01:30:00,205
I'm going to tell you something.

1195
01:30:00,247 --> 01:30:03,512
Something very important,
something you don't know.

1196
01:30:03,551 --> 01:30:06,042
Intercision isn't perfect yet...

1197
01:30:06,086 --> 01:30:08,520
and you're not just anyone, Lyra.

1198
01:30:08,556 --> 01:30:12,890
Your mother didn't die
in an airship accident as you were told.

1199
01:30:12,927 --> 01:30:16,795
She wasn't married to your father,
and even though--

1200
01:30:16,831 --> 01:30:20,426
even though she loved you
very much and...

1201
01:30:20,467 --> 01:30:22,401
and she wanted to keep you...

1202
01:30:24,271 --> 01:30:25,932
it wasn't allowed.

1203
01:30:27,641 --> 01:30:30,769
And so you were taken from her.

1204
01:30:30,811 --> 01:30:34,941
And it wasn't until things changed...

1205
01:30:34,982 --> 01:30:37,712
and she was free to do
as she wanted, that...

1206
01:30:40,521 --> 01:30:43,547
that she went to Jordan College
and she spoke to the Master.

1207
01:30:43,591 --> 01:30:46,059
No! You can't be!

1208
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:56,729
Yes, Lyra, you're mine.

1209
01:30:56,770 --> 01:30:59,671
And you're safe with me.

1210
01:30:59,707 --> 01:31:02,676
You'll always be safe with me.

1211
01:31:05,446 --> 01:31:07,539
Who's my father?

1212
01:31:14,688 --> 01:31:18,180
Lord Asriel.
He's my father, isn't he?

1213
01:31:20,728 --> 01:31:24,027
Yes. Yes.

1214
01:31:33,908 --> 01:31:35,933
Now I almost forgot.

1215
01:31:35,976 --> 01:31:40,276
The Master of Jordan
gave you something, didn't he?

1216
01:31:40,314 --> 01:31:43,374
He gave you an alethiometer,
didn't he?

1217
01:31:44,952 --> 01:31:46,783
But you see...

1218
01:31:48,122 --> 01:31:50,818
it wasn't really his to give.

1219
01:31:52,893 --> 01:31:54,952
Ah, he did. Oh.

1220
01:31:54,995 --> 01:31:59,091
Must've seemed such a puzzle, what
a silly old thing like that was any good for.

1221
01:32:00,134 --> 01:32:02,193
All right.

1222
01:32:04,972 --> 01:32:07,065
Here it is.

1223
01:32:07,107 --> 01:32:08,768
Thank you.

1224
01:32:11,178 --> 01:32:14,011
What a funny old tin. Did you--

1225
01:32:14,048 --> 01:32:17,040
did you put it in here
to keep it safe?

1226
01:32:40,407 --> 01:32:42,466
Run! Lyra, let's go! Go!

1227
01:32:43,577 --> 01:32:46,137
We're just not used to that reaction.

1228
01:32:46,180 --> 01:32:48,876
Understand this, Sister Clara,
they're not registered--

1229
01:34:08,595 --> 01:34:11,029
Go on, then. Go on.

1230
01:34:37,091 --> 01:34:39,787
lorek! lorek!

1231
01:34:40,761 --> 01:34:42,160
Run, child!

1232
01:34:45,332 --> 01:34:47,630
Let's go! Come on!

1233
01:34:55,776 --> 01:34:57,539
- Quickly!
- Let's go!

1234
01:35:15,496 --> 01:35:18,590
You'd better not touch me.
I'm warning you.

1235
01:35:27,107 --> 01:35:29,234
Serafina Pekkala?

1236
01:36:07,347 --> 01:36:10,214
- This way.
- Get out! Get out!

1237
01:36:10,250 --> 01:36:12,115
- Mrs. Coulter!
- Get her up.

1238
01:36:12,152 --> 01:36:14,313
Come!

1239
01:36:16,823 --> 01:36:18,882
- Come on, come on!
- Hurry!

1240
01:36:38,545 --> 01:36:40,638
Charge!

1241
01:36:40,681 --> 01:36:42,410
Come on! Run!

1242
01:37:00,133 --> 01:37:02,431
Come on! Get down, men!

1243
01:37:02,469 --> 01:37:05,267
Mr. Scoresby, help lorek!

1244
01:37:35,669 --> 01:37:37,330
Come on!

1245
01:38:23,850 --> 01:38:27,013
Joe! Oh, my precious!

1246
01:38:27,054 --> 01:38:29,852
- Dad!
- Oh, my goodness, boy!

1247
01:38:31,558 --> 01:38:33,048
- Darling!
- Mum!

1248
01:38:33,093 --> 01:38:34,822
Here's my daughter! Come here!

1249
01:38:41,101 --> 01:38:44,195
Gyptians! To me!

1250
01:38:44,237 --> 01:38:46,330
We're going home!

1251
01:38:49,343 --> 01:38:52,278
Lyra, we've got to go.

1252
01:38:52,312 --> 01:38:54,212
It's time to go home.

1253
01:38:55,248 --> 01:38:56,943
I can't, Roger.

1254
01:38:56,983 --> 01:38:59,850
I've got to go to my father
and bring him the alethiometer.

1255
01:38:59,886 --> 01:39:02,582
- Your father?
- Lord Asriel--

1256
01:39:02,622 --> 01:39:05,250
Mrs. Coulter and them--
they're gonna kill him.

1257
01:39:05,292 --> 01:39:06,691
Then I'm going too.

1258
01:39:06,727 --> 01:39:10,686
You said you was gonna
come and get me. You got me.

1259
01:39:17,270 --> 01:39:21,036
Miss Lyra, are you ready to fly?

1260
01:39:23,844 --> 01:39:25,835
I know where she's going.

1261
01:39:40,193 --> 01:39:43,822
Well, they're all tucked in back there.

1262
01:39:43,864 --> 01:39:46,389
That little girl's somethin', huh?

1263
01:39:51,104 --> 01:39:54,005
There's a prophesy
about that child, Mr. Scoresby.

1264
01:39:55,809 --> 01:39:58,573
She will decide the war
which is to come.

1265
01:39:58,612 --> 01:39:59,977
War?

1266
01:40:01,715 --> 01:40:04,240
I ain't heard rumor of any war.

1267
01:40:04,284 --> 01:40:06,548
You will.

1268
01:40:06,586 --> 01:40:10,249
It is your war too,
whether you know it or not.

1269
01:40:10,290 --> 01:40:14,420
- What would the quarrel be about?
- Nothing less than free will.

1270
01:40:15,562 --> 01:40:20,090
The Magisterium not only seeks to
control everyone in this world...

1271
01:40:20,133 --> 01:40:22,601
but every world in every universe.

1272
01:40:25,405 --> 01:40:28,397
They've been unable
to extend their power until now.

1273
01:40:28,942 --> 01:40:32,639
But if Asriel finds
a way to travel between worlds...

1274
01:40:32,679 --> 01:40:36,445
nothing will stop them
from trying to take over.

1275
01:40:36,483 --> 01:40:38,451
Nothing but us...

1276
01:40:38,485 --> 01:40:40,510
and that child.

1277
01:40:50,530 --> 01:40:52,589
What's it telling you?

1278
01:41:06,947 --> 01:41:08,847
It's telling me about my father.

1279
01:41:09,883 --> 01:41:13,148
It says I'm bringing him
what he needs.

1280
01:41:13,186 --> 01:41:15,381
We're going home, aren't we, Lyra?

1281
01:41:15,422 --> 01:41:17,117
After we save your father.

1282
01:41:19,092 --> 01:41:20,753
Course.

1283
01:41:20,794 --> 01:41:24,127
'Cept, first we gotta sort out
some things that need sorting.

1284
01:41:24,164 --> 01:41:28,294
Like Billy and them other kids that lost
their dæmons. We've got to help them.

1285
01:41:29,169 --> 01:41:30,659
And it isn't like the Magisterium's...

1286
01:41:30,704 --> 01:41:33,229
just gonna let us go home to Jordan
just like that...

1287
01:41:33,273 --> 01:41:35,468
or leave off ordering people about.

1288
01:41:36,710 --> 01:41:38,837
And Dust--

1289
01:41:38,879 --> 01:41:40,506
I want to know what Dust is.

1290
01:41:41,781 --> 01:41:45,114
Maybe we're supposed to go to that other
world with my father and find out.

1291
01:41:45,151 --> 01:41:47,449
That's an awful lot to sort out.

1292
01:41:47,487 --> 01:41:49,182
Well, who else is gonna do it?

1293
01:41:49,222 --> 01:41:51,816
'Sides, we're in this together now.

1294
01:41:51,858 --> 01:41:54,053
Yeah, suppose we are.

1295
01:41:55,829 --> 01:41:59,492
You reckon it would do any harm
to get some sleep now?

1296
01:41:59,533 --> 01:42:00,625
Go on, then.

1297
01:42:10,510 --> 01:42:12,740
We'll set things right.

1298
01:42:12,779 --> 01:42:15,145
We will.

1299
01:42:15,181 --> 01:42:17,581
You and me...

1300
01:42:17,617 --> 01:42:19,448
and lorek.

1301
01:42:19,486 --> 01:42:21,977
And Serafina Pekkala
and Mr. Scoresby.

1302
01:42:24,224 --> 01:42:25,555
And my father.

1303
01:42:26,326 --> 01:42:28,191
We'll set it right, Pan.

1304
01:42:30,597 --> 01:42:32,588
Just let them try to stop us.

1305
01:43:17,477 --> 01:43:20,844
# Where are our lives #

1306
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:24,111
# If there is no dream? #

1307
01:43:24,150 --> 01:43:29,247
# Where is our home? #

1308
01:43:29,289 --> 01:43:33,020
# We don't know how #

1309
01:43:33,059 --> 01:43:36,517
# There will be a way #

1310
01:43:36,563 --> 01:43:39,760
# Out of the storm #

1311
01:43:39,799 --> 01:43:47,433
# We will find hope #

1312
01:43:55,315 --> 01:44:02,483
# And her soul
walks beside her #

1313
01:44:02,522 --> 01:44:08,950
# An army stands behind her #

1314
01:44:08,995 --> 01:44:13,830
# Lyra #

1315

# Lyra #

1316
01:44:16,102 --> 01:44:19,902
# And her face #

1317
01:44:19,939 --> 01:44:22,874
# Full of grace #

1318
01:44:22,909 --> 01:44:26,936
# Two worlds
collide around her #

1319
01:44:26,980 --> 01:44:33,044
# The truth lies
deep inside her #

# Lyra #

1322
01:44:40,727 --> 01:44:47,223
# And the stars
look down upon her #

1323
01:44:47,267 --> 01:44:53,536
# This darkness settles on her #

1324
01:44:53,573 --> 01:44:58,510
# Lyra #

1325
01:44:58,545 --> 01:45:00,740
# Lyra #

1326
01:45:00,780 --> 01:45:07,413
# Who's to know
what's in the future? #

1327
01:45:07,454 --> 01:45:11,356
# Every hope
we will be with her #

1328
01:45:11,391 --> 01:45:17,352
# We have all our love
to give her #

1329
01:45:17,397 --> 01:45:22,528
# Oh, Lyra #

1331

walks beside her #
