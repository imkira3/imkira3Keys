1
00:00:57,099 --> 00:01:01,144
Earth, birthplace of the human race,

2
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:05,398
a species much like our own,

3
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:08,901
capable of great compassion

4
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:12,655
and great violence.

5
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,753
For in our quest to protect the humans,

6
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:29,839
a deeper revelation dawns.

7
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:33,134
Our worlds have met before.

8
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,891
-Newsflash from the BBC.
-Breaking news out of Shanghai.

9
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:26,020
There's been a major toxic spill
in the Shanghai factory district.

10
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,231
We're staying
on top of this developing story for you.

11
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:31,776
We will bring you
any new information as we get it.

12
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:39,158
NEST Seahawks approaching target.

13
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:42,495
Three minutes
until evacuation is complete, sir.

14
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:46,666
Chinese airspace has been locked
and sealed, one-mile radius.

15
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,751
All right, give NEST team the go.

16
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,628
Black Hawks, you're clear to land.

17
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:54,966
Ding-a-ling!
Come out and get your ice cream.

18
00:02:57,636 --> 00:03:01,556
Any bad robot out there
better get ready for an ass-whupping.

19
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,857
For the last two years,
an advance team of new Autobots

20
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:14,235
has taken refuge here
under my command.

21
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,153
Arcees, get ready to launch.

22
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:17,738
We're locked and loaded.

23
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:21,868
Together, we form an alliance
with the humans,

24
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:25,162
a secret but brave squad of soldiers.

25
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:28,165
All right, listen up. China's cover story
on this one is "toxic spill."

26
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,501
They had to evac the area
for search and rescue.

27
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:33,045
This makes six enemy contacts
in eight months.

28
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,340
We gotta make sure this one does not
get out in the public eye, so keep it tight.

29
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:40,636
A classified strike team called NEST.

30
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:44,348
We hunt for what remains
of our Decepticon foes

31
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:47,435
hiding in different countries
around the globe.

32
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,853
Roll in Alpha through Echo now.

33
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,114
Move out! Let's go!

34
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:21,719
All right, lronhide.
We got echoes. They're close.

35
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,722
Steel stacks at 2 o'clock.

36
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:39,487
He's here. l smell him.

37
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,993
lt's close. lt's getting closer.

38
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,167
-Oh, no.
-What have you got?

39
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,503
Thermal ripple.

40
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:00,508
Right, everybody, be steady.
We're right on top of it.

41
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,397
Eagle niner!

42
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,190
l need an energy proton.

43
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,873
Panther 1 , requesting fire mission now!

44
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,376
Gunships on station. Roll in hot!

45
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,253
Dog 1, now we are engaging.

46
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:47,805
We got a second Decepticon.

47
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,686
Arcee twins! Target coming your way!

48
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,151
l got him, l got him!

49
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:33,225
l screwed that up. l'm okay. l'm all right.

50
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,478
-This is combat, man.
-Total brain freeze, man.

51
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:36,645
What's wrong with you?

52
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,109
Bring in Sideswipe!

53
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,488
Clear a path!

54
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:02,671
Damn, l'm good!

55
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:15,434
Air support, we need Big Buddha
to deliver the drop now!

56
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,937
Cyclone 98, final attack hitting in 120.

57
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:22,274
Clear to drop in
five, four, three, two, one.

58
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:38,624
Autobots, l'm in pursuit!

59
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:08,779
Pull over!

60
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,844
Punk-ass Decepticon!

61
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,263
Any last words?

62
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:38,058
This is not your planet to rule!

63
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,477
The Fallen shall rise again.

64
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,647
That doesn't sound good.

65
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,858
Not today.

66
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,490
Come on, let's go! All hands on deck!

67
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:56,368
Frankie, Mojo, out!
Come on, kiddo, we're on a schedule.

68
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,913
Slow down, Dad. Why are you
in such a hurry to get rid of me?

69
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:01,624
-Did you rent the room out?
-No, l got other ideas for your room

70
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,876
and it rhymes with "home theater."

71
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:12,760
Look what l found.
lt's your little baby booties.

72
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:17,223
-Ma.
-My little baby-bootie boy.

73
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,099
-You can't go.
-You see this, Dad? This is how

74
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:20,559
you're supposed to react
when the fruit of your loins

75
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:22,895
goes out into the cruel world
to fend for himself, okay?

76
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,439
Yeah, my heart bleeds for you, pal.
College, bummer!

77
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:29,568
You have to come home every holiday,
not just big ones.

78
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:31,612
You have to come home for Halloween.

79
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,947
Well, l can't
come home for Halloween, Mom.

80
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:34,448
-Well, then we'll come to you.
-You're not coming.

81
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,699
-No, we're not going anywhere.
-We'll dress up.

82
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,076
We'll be in costumes.
You'll never know it's us.

83
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,744
-You can't do that, Mom.
-Would you let the kid breathe,

84
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,621
for crying out loud? Come on. Go pack.

85
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,248
There's no way you're packed
for a month-long trip.

86
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:45,584
Come on, chop, chop!
Let's go. March, young lady.

87
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,420
-Dad.
-l love it when you call me "young lady,"

88
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,547
-you dirty old man.
-You ain't seen nothing yet.

89
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,675
-Dad, Dad, Dad, whoa!
-What?

90
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,135
l'm watching what you're doing, Dad.
lt's not a rap video.

91
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,553
lt's just like a coach thing.

92
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,514
That was
a really creepy move just now, Dad.

93
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:03,727
Look. You know, your mother and me
are really proud of you.

94
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:06,272
You're the first Witwicky
ever to go to college.

95
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:09,984
Now l'm crying again! This sucks!

96
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,860
You're gonna be okay, Ma.

97
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,404
You know, it's just going to be,

98
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:19,285
you know, hard for her to accept
that her boy's all grown up, you know,

99
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:22,288
going out to handle the world
on his own.

100
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,623
-You okay, Pop?
-Yeah.

101
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:27,293
Mojo, no dominating Frankie!

102
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:30,671
Get the hell off the couch,
you filthy beasts!

103
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,798
You'll see a lot of that in college, too.

104
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:36,051
-What are you talking about, Dad?
-There's gonna be a lot of women there.

105
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,803
Yeah, well,
l'm a one-woman kind of guy.

106
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,221
Look, Mikaela's the greatest,

107
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,932
but you gotta give each other
room to grow, okay?

108
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:44,268
You're no different
than any other couple your age.

109
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,520
Except we discovered
an alien race together.

110
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,022
How long you gonna be riding
that scooter?

111
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:02,036
Dad, listen, l know what the odds are.
We're the exception, okay?

112
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,997
Wait a second. Who could that be?

113
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,874
ln two weeks, it could be Muffy.

114
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,208
Hey, beautiful.

115
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,544
-l'm breaking up with you, Sam.
-Really?

116
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,087
You sure?
l'm not hearing a lot of conviction.

117
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:15,758
Well, l am, okay? So, there's no reason
for me to come say good-bye to you.

118
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,093
Wow, you almost sounded serious
that time.

119
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:22,014
Guess what? l made you
a long-distance relationship kit.

120
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,516
Yeah, l got you a webcam,
so we can chat 24/7.

121
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:25,768
All Witwicky, all the time.

122
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,853
And l got you a couple souvenirs
from the event

123
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,188
that cannot be mentioned
on cell phones.

124
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:32,775
-Some mixes and candles and stuff.
-Sounds cute. l can't wait.

125
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:35,194
Hey! You want
the infamous D-Day shirt?

126
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,446
You kept your nasty, shredded clothes?

127
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,031
Yeah. Of course, l kept it, Mikaela.

128
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,158
lt's like my Super Bowl jersey.
l bled in this thing.

129
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,869
-Wow. You're pretty confident, huh?
-No, it's not that.

130
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,372
lt's just that my low self-esteem's
at an all-time high.

131
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:49,708
You think your little box of souvenirs
is gonna keep me from leaving you?

132
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:51,335
You really should come with me.

133
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,170
They got cheap apartments
near campus.

134
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:56,799
Well, that's not gonna happen
until l get my man-child father,

135
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,551
fresh out of prison, back on his feet.

136
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,929
l heard that.
Where'd you put the clutch covers?

137
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:04,390
-Next to the camshafts.
-l love it when you say "camshafts."

138
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:05,516
Whisper it to me.

139
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,853
Camshafts.

140
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,022
Why can't l hate you?

141
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,942
lt's my Witwicky charm.

142
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:16,735
Wait, hold on. Wait, hold on a second.

143
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,738
l guess we're not breaking up.
l'll be over in 20.

144
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:23,492
Mikaela, l think a sliver of the Cube
got stuck on my shirt.

145
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:30,040
Sam?

146
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:39,174
There's a fire!

147
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,427
Dad, we got a fire!

148
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,488
Fire!

149
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,168
Ron, did you know
it was gonna be this hard?

150
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:15,794
Can you just stop?

151
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:18,589
Yeah, okay, l'll stop. You carry this shit!

152
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,225
-Wow.
-Do you know what?

153
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,560
-What?
-l don't want to go anywhere with you.

154
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,811
l don't wanna go to France with you.

155
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,438
l don't wanna go
around the corner with you.

156
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,814
-l'm going back inside.
-All right, fine.

157
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:36,940
l'll call you from Paris.

158
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,829
What is all the racket?

159
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:51,914
Sam?

160
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,374
Dad!

161
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:01,840
-What was that?
-That's the whole kitchen!

162
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,429
-Bumblebee... Oh, my...
-Bumblebee!

163
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,868
-91 1 .
-Bumblebee!

164
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,871
-Get in the garage. Go!
-What the freak just happened?

165
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:37,209
l'm about to have a nervous breakdown.
Just go in the garage quietly, please.

166
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,794
Holy Mother!

167
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:44,800
-Oh, my God!
-Whatever.

168
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,052
Get in the garage now!

169
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,227
-Firemen! Fire fighters, over here!
-Dogs out! Get the dogs out!

170
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:59,022
This is it! Come on, you guys.
What are you waiting for?

171
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,697
My house is on fire!

172
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,202
-...very important.
-What happened?

173
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:16,999
Come here. Listen, l need you to take
the Cube sliver and put it in your purse.

174
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,250
-What's going on?
-Just take it.

175
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,252
-Sam Witwicky? A word with you.
-Yes, Mom. Yeah.

176
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,504
-Hi, Mikaela. l have a bald spot.
-Hi.

177
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,965
-An old furnace, l think.
-From a waffle iron.

178
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:28,594
When you go, he goes. l cannot live
with a psychotic alien in my garage!

179
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:31,346
Judy... National security.

180
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,975
Look, if we stay quiet,
they're gonna take care of everything.

181
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:38,395
Just consider this
the official start of our remodel, okay?

182
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,523
Fine. lf the government's paying,
l want a pool and a hot tub!

183
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,067
And l'm gonna skinny-dip
and you can't say shit about it!

184
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:51,283
-Yeah, you know you're in trouble.
-He still having voice problems?

185
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,785
He's playing it up.

186
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,955
Bee, l want to talk to you
about the college thing, okay?

187
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,292
l'm so excited and l just can't hide it

188
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,502
Hey, l'm not taking you with me.

189
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,340
l'm gonna wait outside, okay?

190
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,176
l meant to tell you about this earlier.

191
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,720
lt's just that, you know...
Here's the thing.

192
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,014
Freshmen aren't allowed to have cars.

193
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:17,100
l know, and if it was up to me,
l'd take you with me, but it's not, Bee.

194
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:19,978
Look. You're an Autobot. You shouldn't
be living in my dad's garage.

195
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:24,441
l mean, you're suffocating in here.
You deserve better than this.

196
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:25,984
This is hard enough, man.
Don't make it harder.

197
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,445
Can you just look at me, please?

198
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,908
Come on, big guy.
Look, the guardian thing is done.

199
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:36,328
Okay? You did yourjob.
Look, l'm safe now.

200
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,872
You need to go be with
Optimus Prime and the others.

201
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:42,334
l just want to be normal, Bee.
That's why l'm going to college,

202
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,586
and l can't do that with you.

203
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,506
lt's not the last time l'm gonna see you,
you know, Bee.

204
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:51,385
Come on, don't do that. Bee.
You're killing me, Bee.

205
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,597
But you'll always be my first car.

206
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,142
Love you, Bee.

207
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:05,982
Wow!

208
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:09,236
Between State Farm and the taxpayers,
we're all taken care of.

209
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,821
-You got dirt all over you.
-Stop. Stop.

210
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:12,406
-What?
-Stop, l'm okay.

211
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,865
Look.

212
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:17,202
So, you think you can make it through
those East Coast winters without me?

213
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,538
You're the best thing
to ever happen to me.

214
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:22,624
-And?
-And l'll do anything for you.

215
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,543
And?

216
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:27,713
-l think Sam's about to say the L-word.
-Let's go, kiddo!

217
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:28,880
Nice timing, Dad.

218
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,966
l adore you.

219
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,385
That's not the word that l want

220
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,886
-to hear right now.
-What are you talking about?

221
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:35,971
lt's the same word as the other word.

222
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,889
-lt's not the same word.
-Look, if l say the other word now

223
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,516
and you forced me to say it,
it won't mean anything, plus

224
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,852
you haven't said it either.
So, don't get mad at me for not saying it.

225
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:44,521
Yeah, but l haven't said it because guys
always run when you say it first.

226
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:48,233
Yeah, well, so do girls.
Especially girls like you, with options.

227
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:52,487
So, this is all part of your elaborate plan
to keep me interested?

228
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:56,158
-lt can be.
-l hate that it's working.

229
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:58,994
Can l have a kiss?

230
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,830
We're going to make it work, l promise.

231
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:38,950
Soundwave acknowledges. Pursue her.

232
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,036
Retrieve it.

233
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:05,602
Autobot twins, report to Hangar Three.

234
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,522
Bad-ass ice-cream truck
coming through.

235
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,482
-Excuse me! Excuse me! Hello!
-No, l don't...

236
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,691
-Hold up.
-Those are nice.

237
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,401
Yeah, baby, it's upgrade time.

238
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:17,155
Yes, sir. Yeah!
Look here, it's my booty call right here!

239
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,117
-Time to get my sexy on with the green.
-Green? No, green is mine!

240
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:22,577
l call green!

241
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,040
-l got the green.
-That hurt, man.

242
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,292
lt's supposed to hurt. lt's an ass-kicking.

243
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,763
Present arms!

244
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:58,530
Director Galloway, what an honor.
l'd love to show you around,

245
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,115
but you gotta be
on the classified access list.

246
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,784
l am now. Presidential order, Major.

247
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,787
l got a message
for your classified space buddies!

248
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:07,956
You guys made a mess of Shanghai.

249
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:14,337
All right, so this is where
we communicate with the JCS

250
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:17,591
and this area serves
as the Autobots' hangar.

251
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,970
Secure link to JCS is up, Major.

252
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,662
Secure line to
the Pentagon is now open.

253
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,749
-General?
-Will, I saw the Shanghai op.

254
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,335
-We had a rough day out there.
-Yes, sir.

255
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:56,296
We have intel that I believe
warrants an immediate debrief.

256
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,590
Now with your permission,
l can't let you see him,

257
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,051
but l would like you to hear
from the leader of the Autobots.

258
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:02,177
Proceed.

259
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,447
You gotta wonder,

260
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,867
if God made us in his image,
who made him?

261
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,245
General, our alliance
has countermanded

262
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,957
six Decepticon incursions this year,

263
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,626
each on a different continent.

264
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,629
They're clearly searching
around the world for something,

265
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:41,091
but last night's encounter
came with a warning.

266
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:43,843
"The Fallen shall rise again."

267
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:46,221
"The Fallen." Meaning what?

268
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,724
Origin unknown.
The only recorded history of our race

269
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:53,979
was contained within the AllSpark
and lost with its destruction.

270
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:55,647
Excuse me!

271
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,986
With this so-called AllSpark
now destroyed,

272
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:04,614
why hasn't the enemy left the planet
like you thought they would?

273
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:06,992
Director Galloway,
our National Security Advisor.

274
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:10,036
The Presidentjust appointed him liaison.

275
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:12,706
Well, l guess l didn't get that memo.

276
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:17,794
Forgive the interruption, General.
Excuse me. Coming through.

277
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:20,255
Excuse me. Excuse me, soldier.

278
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:23,550
After all the damage in Shanghai,

279
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:27,595
the President is hard-pressed
to say the job's getting done.

280
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:33,893
Now, under the classified Alien/Autobot
Cooperation Act,

281
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:39,524
you agreed to share your intel with us,
but not your advancements in weaponry.

282
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:43,528
We've witnessed
your human capacity for war.

283
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:47,198
lt would absolutely bring
more harm than good.

284
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:50,160
But who are you to judge
what's best for us?

285
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,287
With all due respect,
we've been fighting side by side

286
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,913
in the field for two years.

287
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:57,292
We've shed blood,
sweat and precious metal together.

288
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,086
Soldier, you're paid to shoot, not talk.

289
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:01,796
Don't tempt me.

290
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:04,382
And the newest members of your team.

291
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:06,760
-Easy.
-l understand they arrived here

292
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,720
after you sent a message into space,

293
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:12,557
an open invitation to come to Earth,
vetted by no one at the White House.

294
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:16,394
Let me stop you right there,
Mr. Galloway. lt was vetted right here.

295
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:20,398
And in my experience, the judgment
of both Major Lennox and his team

296
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:23,401
has always been above reproach.

297
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:26,321
Well, be that as it may, General,
it is the position of the President

298
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:31,951
that when our national security is
at stake, no one is above reproach.

299
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,163
Now, what do we know so far?

300
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:41,669
We know that the enemy leader,
classified NBE One, aka Megatron,

301
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:45,340
is rusting in peace at the bottom
of the Laurentian Abyssal,

302
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:49,928
surrounded by SOSUS detection nets
and a full-time submarine surveillance.

303
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:54,432
We also know that the only remaining
piece of your alien AllSpark

304
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:56,434
is locked in an electromagnetic vault

305
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:59,854
here on one of the most secure
naval bases in the worId.

306
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:04,442
Decepticons, we have located the shard.

307
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:10,365
And since no one can seem to tell me
what the enemy is now after,

308
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:13,284
well, there's only one clear conclusion!

309
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:16,204
You! The Autobots!

310
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,332
They're here to hunt you!

311
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,377
What's there to hunt for on Earth
besides that?

312
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:25,338
"The Fallen shall rise again"?

313
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,632
lt sounds to me
like something's coming.

314
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:32,470
So, let me ask, if we ultimately conclude
that our national security is best served

315
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:36,266
by denying you further asylum
on our planet,

316
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:41,271
will you leave peacefully?

317
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:46,234
Freedom is your right. lf you make
that request, we will honor it.

318
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:52,574
But before your President decides,
please ask him this.

319
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:57,537
What if we leave and you're wrong?

320
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:07,088
That's a good question.

321
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:13,720
Oh, my gosh! Look at this place!

322
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:16,848
l feel smarter already.

323
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,811
-Ron, can you smell it?
-Yeah, smells like $40,000 a year.

324
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:26,399
-Hey, cheapo!
-Hey, go ahead. We'll get your stuff.

325
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:27,525
Just go ahead and check out your room.

326
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:28,610
Yeah, go.

327
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:38,203
-Hey.
-Hey.

328
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:41,206
-You must be Sam, right? l'm Leo.
-Hey.

329
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:45,793
So, l already set up the crib a bit.
You want this side or that side?

330
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:49,380
-That side.
-l already chose that side.

331
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:53,760
You know what this is?
This is the awkward moment.

332
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:55,428
Yeah, see,
you're trying to see if l'm a normal guy.

333
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,804
l'm trying to see if you're a normal guy.

334
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,431
Balanced, unmedicated,
nothing under the crawl space.

335
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,891
Good personal hygiene,
won't stab me in my sleep.

336
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,017
No criminal record, won't steal anything.

337
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,644
-lncluding girlfriends.
-Especially girlfriends.

338
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,979
-You got a girlfriend?
-l do. You?

339
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,441
No, not a chance. You a techie?

340
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,735
Sweet! Sharsky,
Fassbinder, where we at?

341
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,071
-Server's almost online, Leo.
-Network's up and running.

342
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,572
Beautiful, that's what l like to hear.

343
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:17,659
That's Sharsky, that's Fassbinder,
my lT gurus.

344
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:20,870
Welcome to my empire, bro,
TheRealEffingDeal.com.

345
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:22,205
That's me, l'm sure you've heard of it.

346
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,707
-No, l haven't.
-Well, that sucks.

347
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:26,251
-What is all this for?
-See where l'm going, bro.

348
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:29,254
Look, call me gross,
l want to be a baby billionaire.

349
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:31,839
Kitten calendars.
That's where l started. Look at me now.

350
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,174
Got to have dreams, bro.

351
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,929
Leo! We got
some brand-new Shanghai vid!

352
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,974
Post it, baby! Go, go, go! FTJ! FTJ!

353
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:43,434
-What's "FTJ"?
-"Fuel the Jet."

354
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:44,852
Fuel the Jet, bro.

355
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:47,313
FTJ. FTJ, legit!

356
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:49,774
Did you see that? Did you see that?

357
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,318
Look at this. Half of Shanghai gets
wrecked and China says "gas leak."

358
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:54,779
Don't believe the hype, bro.

359
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:58,491
Just like the alien robots in LA
two years ago that everyone covered up.

360
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,952
Yeah, l saw these robots,
and they did this, like, firing thing

361
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:03,288
and they came down and toasted
this woman, and she was like...

362
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:05,331
-lt looks fake to me.
-Dude, it's not fake.

363
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:08,501
The lnternet is pure truth.
Video doesn't lie.

364
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,211
-lt looks fake.
-No, man, l've seen them.

365
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:13,506
-They're, like, these robots...
-Look, look, it's fake.

366
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,091
Anybody could do it
on any computer, okay?

367
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:17,218
And l wasn't there,

368
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:19,512
-so l can't comment or speculate.
-No.

369
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,806
"Comment or speculate"?
And we're supposed to cohabitate?

370
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,851
No, listen, okay?
Don't be sucking the sack, bro!

371
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:26,644
-Which sack?
-The ball sack.

372
00:27:26,729 --> 00:27:28,271
Dude, what kind of tool are you?

373
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:31,357
Mainstream media sack.
They're lying to us, all right?

374
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:33,818
-lt's aliens, man.
-Okay, okay.

375
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,153
Follow me.

376
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,238
Leo, bad news!

377
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:39,657
We just got scooped.
The video's already up on GFR.

378
00:27:39,742 --> 00:27:41,242
Fassbinder!

379
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:44,662
Robo-Warrior, the guy's our main
competition on conspiracy stuff.

380
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:46,789
"Effing" was my F-ing idea
and he stole it!

381
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:49,375
He's been linking to my site
and thieving hits forever.

382
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,836
By the way, l read your file.
l'm poor, you're poor.

383
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,089
We're gonna fix that, all right?
You work for me now.

384
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:58,509
l work for you now? That's incredible.

385
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:01,512
lt's first day of college,
l got a career in a dinky lnternet firm

386
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:04,640
with a boss who is made up
ofjust pure champion stuff.

387
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:06,684
Are you mocking
my life's work, Samuel?

388
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:08,311
That's your one warning patrolling,
dude. Don't make me

389
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,021
have Fassbinder hack your financial aid,
'cause l'll do it!

390
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:13,358
Hey, RA. Listen, it's getting a little
intense in my room. Can l switch out?

391
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:18,321
Sad face, 31 2. No switching, no trading.
Let's turn that frown upside down, okay?

392
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,489
-Oh, here we go.
-We made it. Hi.

393
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:20,698
lt's just like Hogwarts.

394
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:21,991
-Hi.
-ls this co-ed?

395
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:23,368
This is a co-ed dorm.

396
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:24,911
-You guys want to meet my roommates?
-Yeah.

397
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:26,245
Some real swell guys.

398
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:27,705
-Here's Leo.
-We're the Witwickys.

399
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,873
-l'm Leo.
-l'm Judy.

400
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,750
Hey, you have a great son, you really do.

401
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,378
-Well, aren't you the sweetest thing?
-Yeah, he's real sweet, Ma.

402
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:34,629
What is that in your hand, by the way?

403
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:38,800
l got this at the bake sale for the
environment that those boys are having.

404
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:41,803
You know, you don't often see
white boys with the dreadlocks.

405
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:43,429
-Mom?
-Yeah, it's 1 00% pure,

406
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:45,139
Hawaiian green for the environment.

407
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:46,724
-How many of these have you eaten?
-Drop it.

408
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:48,726
-What is this?
-Yeah, they baked it with reefer in it.

409
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:50,186
-No, it's...
-Please, give me...

410
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,397
Hey! lt's my cheat day.
l can eat what l want.

411
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,399
l'm going to freak out.
Please do something right now, Dad.

412
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:55,691
Please do something right now.

413
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:58,319
l can eat all the fricking brownies l want!

414
00:28:58,404 --> 00:28:59,445
Come on, let's go.

415
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,030
l'm sorry and you're welcome.

416
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,952
We call it the "Hot Freshman 55."

417
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:08,996
Sharsky hacked Campus Housing and
stacked the dorm with pretty Betties.

418
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,499
ls... ls so nice...

419
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:15,962
Oh, my God. That's her. She's coming.
She sees me, she sees me.

420
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,632
She's tied for number one
on my to-do list.

421
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,426
Do not bird-dog my quail, you hear me?

422
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:25,763
Pretty girls! Hey, you.
My son lives in this dorm.

423
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:29,016
You should go make friends with him.
He's Sam.

424
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,435
Glad she ain't my mama!

425
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,728
And he recently had his cherry popped!

426
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:36,107
He didn't know l was in the house!
l heard it all!

427
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,859
-Hey! Hey! Hey!
-Here he is!

428
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:41,487
He would get in my closet
and dress up as Boy Spice!

429
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:47,452
-Hey, and his car is a talking robot!
-No, like the GPS. OnStar!

430
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,370
-OnStar.
-Frisbee!

431
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:53,499
No, Dad! Dad, you just gonna
let her run around the school?

432
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,299
-Give it! Mine, mine, mine!
-Hey! Crazy!

433
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:03,551
-You want it?
-l want it.

434
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:07,054
Judy, Judy, just... Just put it down.

435
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,515
-You gotta control your mother.
-l don't know who this woman is.

436
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,143
Hey, Professor, l'd do anything for an A.

437
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:15,104
All right, Grace Slick. We got
some snacks in the car. Let's go.

438
00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:18,065
-Did you get the booties? All right.
-Yes, Dad, l got the booties!

439
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:19,942
l'm upside down!

440
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,518
Black Lion X-Ray,
this is Black Lion Tango.

441
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:57,438
We have activation of motion sensors
on the western perimeter fence.

442
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,433
Breach at B-14.

443
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:21,689
Go, go, go, go!

444
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,699
The shard's gone.

445
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:41,667
Contact!

446
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:44,045
Take it down!

447
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:46,297
-Which way?
-Shoot left!

448
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:53,471
Knock it down!

449
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:05,316
First frat party's the game changer.
Boys, we're hunting in the wild now.

450
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,068
So, get your game faces on.

451
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:09,278
l can't stay long.
l have a webcam date with my girlfriend.

452
00:33:09,363 --> 00:33:10,571
-That's so cool!
-No, it's not.

453
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:18,579
While he's making out
with his MacBook,

454
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:20,539
l'm gonna be getting
my Spitzy freaky freak on.

455
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:22,833
-Let's roll.
-She's hot.

456
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:24,752
Bro, we're hunting!

457
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:30,132
-See you, darling.
-Bye, Dad.

458
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:32,301
Okay.

459
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,601
This is our first live chat date.
l've never done it before.

460
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:42,978
l'm kind of nervous.

461
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,799
-Are you okay?
-No.

462
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:15,553
l was getting a napkin for my drink.

463
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:18,973
Thanks. Cheers.

464
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,058
-lt's Sam, right?
-Yeah.

465
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:24,812
-l wanna dance.
-What, like... Like dancing?

466
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:27,982
Like a pairing? Like a duo?
Like a coupling?

467
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:32,862
'Cause l'm in a permanently semi...
l'm in a relationship, kind of...

468
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:37,283
-Relax. l just want to have some fun.
-Wanna have some fun?

469
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:41,370
Yeah, okay. Let's play some checkers.
You can sit over there and...

470
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,331
Oh, my...

471
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:48,043
So, how about tonight
you pretend l'm your girlfriend

472
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:50,254
and l pretend that you're my boyfriend?

473
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:03,517
Hey! Who drove
the freaking yellow Camaro?

474
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,937
There is a car on the lawn!

475
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:11,942
What are you doing?

476
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,527
Houston, we have a problem.

477
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:14,695
-What is it?
-Freshman!

478
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,280
-Yeah?
-ls that your car in our bushes?

479
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:20,242
No, there's a friend of mine,
he just went to get you a tighter shirt.

480
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:23,037
There isn't a tighter shirt! We checked.

481
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,747
Now how about
l park my foot in your ass?

482
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:26,457
-What size shoe do you wear?
-Yeah?

483
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,542
-Hold on.
-You wanna try?

484
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:31,462
-l'll back it up right now.
-Get him out of here.

485
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:34,298
You have a ride?
Bro, why are you holding out on us?

486
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,466
l've only known you 1 7 hours.

487
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:39,053
This is gonna really change our lives.
You have no idea.

488
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:43,349
-l love Camaros.
-l can't do this right now, okay?

489
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:45,351
-Don't be a wimp.
-Oh, God!

490
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:57,988
-My first car was my dad's '92 Z28.
-Yeah?

491
00:35:58,073 --> 00:36:02,827
Fuel-injected.
The roar of the engine, it just tickles me.

492
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:06,205
We shouldn't stare...

493
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:09,792
l mean, share stories
with each other at all.

494
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:12,169
Come on, Sam. Just one ride.

495
00:36:12,254 --> 00:36:14,755
Your cheatin' heart

496
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:20,010
Don't. Don't!

497
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:22,847
She's a super freak, super freak
She's super freaky

498
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:26,058
-ls your radio broken?
-No, my concentration is.

499
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,935
We're not cheating.

500
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,563
Not yet.

501
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,901
ls something wrong here?

502
00:36:40,282 --> 00:36:42,074
God! You okay?

503
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,036
She's mighty, mighty

504
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:49,415
l really don't know what to tell you.
This car has a lot of problems. A lot...

505
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,631
Oh, God! lt's in my mouth!

506
00:36:58,091 --> 00:37:00,050
Are you okay? l got Wetnaps.

507
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:02,511
l got Wetnaps for your face! Hold on!

508
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:04,680
l... l'm so sorry!

509
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:07,516
What are you doing?

510
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:22,531
You won't give me a day, huh?

511
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:26,410
-You won't give me one day in college?
-l'm sorry, Sam,

512
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:29,830
but the last fragment of the AllSpark
was stolen.

513
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,749
Like what? Like Decepticons stole it?

514
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:35,878
We placed it under human protection
at your government's request,

515
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:38,756
but l'm here for your help, Sam,

516
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:43,260
because your leaders believe we
brought vengeance upon your planet.

517
00:37:43,345 --> 00:37:45,346
Perhaps they are right.

518
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:50,517
That is why they must be reminded by
another human of the trust we share.

519
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:53,312
-This isn't my war.
-Not yet,

520
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:56,774
but l fear it soon will be.

521
00:37:56,858 --> 00:38:00,402
Your world must not share
the same fate as Cybertron.

522
00:38:01,655 --> 00:38:03,656
Whole generations lost.

523
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:10,537
l know, and l want to help you, l do,

524
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:13,707
but l am not some alien ambassador,
you know?

525
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,584
l'm a normal kid with normal problems.

526
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:19,046
l am where l'm supposed to be.

527
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,384
l'm sorry. l...

528
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,136
l really am.

529
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:30,057
Sam, fate rarely calls upon us
at a moment of our choosing.

530
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,686
You're Optimus Prime.
You don't need me.

531
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:37,940
We do, more than you know.

532
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:15,561
Conn, Sonar. Gained new contact,
bearing 214, and possible hostile,

533
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:17,646
confirmed for
Project Deep Six Drop Point.

534
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:20,441
-What do you got?
-SU pulled five contacts at 5,000 feet,

535
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:21,734
diving fast.

536
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:28,032
Never seen anything
dive that deep that fast.

537
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:31,618
-Man battle stations.
-Chief of the watch, man battle stations!

538
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:33,579
Helm, left full rudder,
all ahead two-thirds.

539
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:36,373
-Left full rudder, two-thirds.
-Dive, go deep.

540
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:00,773
The nets protecting NBE One
are screaming, sir.

541
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:04,735
That is 9,300 fathoms down.
And no confirmed DSRVs on site?

542
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,987
-None, sir.
-Then, people, we've got a problem!

543
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:21,293
Need parts! Kill the little one!

544
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,886
The shard make Energon!

545
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:47,069
Conn, Sonar. Now hold six contacts,
and they're coming up fast!

546
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:49,530
-Sound collision alarm.
-Left hard rudder.

547
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:52,366
Five hundred feet.

548
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:55,369
Angel Six,
we got six hostiles coming up.

549
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:05,587
-Collision imminent port side.
-One hundred feet.

550
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:06,713
Brace for impact.

551
00:41:33,283 --> 00:41:36,285
Starscream, l'm home.

552
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:41,456
Lord Megatron, l was so relieved
to hear of your resurrection.

553
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:45,711
You left me to die
on that pathetic insect planet.

554
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:50,674
Only to help spawn our new army.
The Fallen decrees it!

555
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:55,095
After all, in your absence,
someone had to take command.

556
00:41:57,015 --> 00:42:00,392
-So disappointing.
-Hatchlings! Hatchlings! Careful, fragile!

557
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:04,605
Even in death,
there is no command but mine.

558
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:13,989
My master, l failed you on Earth.

559
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:19,703
The AllSpark is destroyed
and without it, our race will perish.

560
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:26,168
You have much to learn, my disciple.
The Cube was merely a vessel.

561
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:29,880
lts power, its knowledge,
can never be destroyed.

562
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:34,551
-lt can only transform.
-How is that possible?

563
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:38,222
lt has been absorbed
by the human child.

564
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:43,352
The key to saving our race
now lies within his mind.

565
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:47,064
Well, then, let me strip
the very flesh from his body!

566
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:50,609
And you will, my apprentice, in time.

567
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:55,989
For millennia, l have dreamed
of my return to that wretched planet

568
00:42:56,074 --> 00:43:02,663
where l, too, was once betrayed
by the Primes l called my brothers.

569
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:10,337
Only a Prime can defeat me,
and now, only one remains.

570
00:43:10,672 --> 00:43:14,049
Optimus! He protects the boy.

571
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:17,427
Then the boy will lead us to him

572
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:23,016
-and revenge will be ours.
-Yes.

573
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:28,188
The boy will not escape us.
We have him in our sights.

574
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:33,318
Without more Energon,
the hatchlings will keep dying.

575
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:43,120
Space. Time. Gravity.

576
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,127
-Thank you.
-Finish that for me.

577
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:53,088
We're going on a journey together,
you and l, today.

578
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:58,176
All you eager, nubile, young minds
on the very cusp of adulthood.

579
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:02,014
And l shall be your consort, your guide,

580
00:44:02,098 --> 00:44:06,101
your chaperone,
into the heart of darkness.

581
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:10,939
Welcome to Astronomy 1 01 .

582
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:15,569
For what do we know about the stars?

583
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:19,531
Virgo, the virgin.

584
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,534
Orion, the great hunter.

585
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:27,247
These are no mere twinkling diamonds
for lovely maidens to wish upon.

586
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:29,666
No, they are dynamos

587
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:34,338
filled with a throbbing,
savage and pent-up energy!

588
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:40,135
Behold the work ofAlbert Einstein,
a professor once, like moi.

589
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,678
-Energy equals mass...
-What you doing?

590
00:44:41,763 --> 00:44:43,221
Put your hand down.
Put your hand down.

591
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:45,724
Young man, there are no questions

592
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,768
until l've reached
the climax of my lecture.

593
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:51,188
l just finished your book and there's
only one problem. Einstein's wrong.

594
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:53,273
Energy does equal
mass times the velocity

595
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:54,441
of light squared in this dimension,

596
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:57,486
but what about the other 1 7?
Nobody ever talks about the other 1 7.

597
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,780
Clear example.

598
00:45:03,493 --> 00:45:04,826
Break down the elemental components
of Energon,

599
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:07,371
assume a constant decay rate
and extrapolate for each of the...

600
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,872
Fourteen galactic convergences it took

601
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:12,584
the Sentinel Prime expedition
to receive an... Echo on its signal,

602
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,628
you wind up with a formula
for inter-dimensional energy increase

603
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,129
that mass and light alone
can't possibly explain.

604
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:18,507
Come on, guys, l can't be
the only one in the class who...

605
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:23,345
Young man, l will not be
punk'd in front of the dean.

606
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:28,100
No, this is my universe here.

607
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:33,563
Do you understand?
l am the alpha and the omega.

608
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:36,066
-Get out of my class!
-Yes, sir.

609
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,738
Anyone else care to have
some sort of mental breakdown?

610
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:56,795
Hi, Bones! Hi. Hi.
You're such a good boy.

611
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,673
What a good boy, you are.

612
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:06,888
Hey, Bones. Are you hungry?

613
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:12,519
Come on, check that out.

614
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,189
There you go.

615
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:25,532
-Yes, Samuel?
-Hello? Mikaela?

616
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:28,201
l can't believe you're gonna stand me up
on our first web chat date.

617
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:31,079
-Something just happened to me, okay?
-What, you finally hit puberty?

618
00:46:31,164 --> 00:46:32,789
No, no, no. Stop laughing.
This is serious. Okay.

619
00:46:32,874 --> 00:46:34,583
Remember l was telling you
about my great-great-grandfather,

620
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:36,460
Archibald Witwicky? Remember?

621
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:39,629
Watch it, watch it, watch... No!
Okay, remember how l was telling you...

622
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:42,007
Okay. Can you stop?
Watch the foot! Watch your foot!

623
00:46:42,091 --> 00:46:43,133
Mikaela, okay,

624
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:45,302
my great-great-grandfather
went on this Arctic mission, right?

625
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:46,970
And he saw Megatron.
Megatron zapped him,

626
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,930
and he started seeing
these crazy symbols. Okay.

627
00:46:49,015 --> 00:46:50,432
Well, now l'm seeing them, too.
Excuse me.

628
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:52,976
l just read a 903-page astronomy book
in 32.6 seconds.

629
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,436
l had a meltdown
in the middle of my class.

630
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,688
l am seeing symbols ever since l...

631
00:46:57,899 --> 00:47:01,902
-Since what?
-Ever since l touched the Cube splinter.

632
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:03,987
-Do you have it?
-Yeah, l have it.

633
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:07,949
-lt's in the shop safe. lt's fine.
-Mikaela, do not touch it, okay?

634
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:09,576
-Don't touch it.
-l'm not gonna touch it.

635
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:11,495
Sam, it's fine. lt's locked away.

636
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:13,914
-No one knows where it is.
-l do!

637
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:18,752
You're hot, but you ain't too bright.

638
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:22,923
There we go. Yeah, that'll work.

639
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:27,260
Damn it! Son of a bitch!

640
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:32,265
What are you looking at, slobber puss?

641
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:36,811
What the... This place is
a freaking house of horrors!

642
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:41,775
Pain... lt hurts...

643
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:44,319
Hold on.

644
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:49,366
Right to five, then...

645
00:47:57,667 --> 00:48:00,877
ls that the best you got, huh?
ls that the best you can do?

646
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:04,464
What are you doing here,
you little freak?

647
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:07,092
That's my eye, you crazy bitch!

648
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:11,388
-You gonna talk now?
-l seek knowledge from the Cube.

649
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:13,223
-The Fallen demands me!
-What knowledge?

650
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,934
You got the shard, l need the shard.
Give me the shard. l need the shard.

651
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:18,562
They're gonna whack me!
l'm gonna be dead without that shard!

652
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:21,731
Easy, warrior goddess,
l'm just a little salvage-scrap drone!

653
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:25,110
-And l'm your worst nightmare.
-Hey, hey, hey!

654
00:48:25,194 --> 00:48:26,611
-What the hell was that?
-l'll tell you later,

655
00:48:26,696 --> 00:48:28,238
just not on an open phone line, okay?

656
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:29,281
l'm gonna get on a plane right now

657
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:31,575
and l'll be there later this afternoon.
Just be careful, Sam.

658
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,627
And have any strangers given you
anything suspicious to carry on today?

659
00:48:42,712 --> 00:48:44,421
Yeah, a live bomb!

660
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:45,797
-No.
-Good.

661
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:01,104
Major, incoming SOS from Autobots!

662
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:04,983
Multiple Decepticon contacts in motion.
Vicinity, eastern United States, sir!

663
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:08,069
-As in how many?
-Unclear, sir.

664
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:09,529
Well, get clear.

665
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:17,078
The Autobots are on the move,
splitting into two teams, sir.

666
00:49:17,163 --> 00:49:18,246
They're not answering our calls

667
00:49:18,331 --> 00:49:19,914
and they're heading to
New York and Philadelphia.

668
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:23,209
All right, full weapons deployment.
Wheels up in 20 minutes!

669
00:49:24,045 --> 00:49:25,253
Move it!

670
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:28,506
Let's go!

671
00:49:33,763 --> 00:49:36,890
Flight 57, welcome to Philadelphia.

672
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:41,061
Alicia, mi amor, can l interest you
in an 1 8-inch Zookeeper's special?

673
00:49:41,145 --> 00:49:43,647
Extra-large, triple cheese,
with every known animal as a topping.

674
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:45,774
Basically, l've got,
like, 1 8 inches of meat.

675
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:48,443
Unless you're vegetarian.
All right. lt's cool. l am, too.

676
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:51,821
-Sam home?
-Sam? l think he died,

677
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:53,198
but why don't we check?

678
00:49:53,282 --> 00:49:55,158
-Here we are.
-Hey!

679
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:56,409
You ever have a song stuck
in your head? lt's like

680
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:58,453
the worst song ever,
but you can't help to whistle it or sing it

681
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:02,207
'cause it, like, repeats itself, repeats
itself, repeats itself, repeats itself?

682
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:04,417
Kitten calendar,
kitten calendar, kitten calendar,

683
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:05,835
-kitten calendar...
-Dude, what the eff?

684
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,004
l know you're freaking out.
Don't freak out. Don't freak out.

685
00:50:08,089 --> 00:50:10,173
Easy fix. Puzzle code in my head.

686
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:11,841
Now it's on the walls.
Everything is good.

687
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:14,010
This is the part that...

688
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:18,890
Okay, what were you saying?

689
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:22,352
Alice, l'm horrified you had to see this.
Let's go.

690
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:23,770
Get out.

691
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,689
Wait, wait, wait!
Can l just sit and watch?

692
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:27,899
l'll... l'll eat my pizza quietly.

693
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:30,902
Sam, l knew there was
something special about you.

694
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:32,278
Really?

695
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,907
And l know you know what happens

696
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:38,910
when two people in the know
get together.

697
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:42,288
They're genuinely amazing in bed.

698
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:45,583
Thank you.

699
00:50:46,836 --> 00:50:48,378
All right, listen, hold on! Boundaries.

700
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:53,550
-Flag on the play. Okay. l'm very ticklish.
-We have needs, Sam. Relax.

701
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:54,843
Jeez!

702
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:59,848
What about this economy?
lt's crazy, isn't it?

703
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:04,978
-You are very aggressive.
-Just relax.

704
00:51:05,104 --> 00:51:07,397
You want some turkey meatloaf?

705
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:13,695
Sam?

706
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:18,575
-Mikaela!
-ls that your girlfriend?

707
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:20,827
Ex.

708
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:23,997
Mikaela! Wait!

709
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:27,751
l can explain...

710
00:51:46,187 --> 00:51:48,229
Sam, your bed buddy, Alice...

711
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:08,291
All right, come on.

712
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:09,918
-She's coming!
-She's an alien robot! You gotta move.

713
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:11,336
-ls this real?
-Just run!

714
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:20,553
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! l can't believe
l almost had sex with her in my dream!

715
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:22,347
l can tell
that you really missed me a lot, Sam!

716
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:23,807
-Look, it's not my fault, okay?
-lt's not your fault?

717
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:25,308
Listen! Listen, l'm a victim!

718
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:26,726
-You were a victim? Of what?
-Yeah.

719
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:28,645
-Of what, a little 80-pound girl?
-Of... Of molestation.

720
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:30,438
lt was like getting humped
in the neck by a mountain ox!

721
00:52:30,523 --> 00:52:31,856
You didn't have to put your tongue
in her mouth!

722
00:52:31,941 --> 00:52:33,066
-l didn't! Look!
-You did!

723
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,652
You ever had your stomach tongued by
a mountain ox with a five-foot tongue?

724
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:38,905
lt's not fun for me, okay, Mikaela?
And it smelled like... Like diesel!

725
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:42,325
-Like a diesel-y tinge to it!
-You're such a little girl!

726
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:44,327
We're gonna have
1 0 seconds of silence right now.

727
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:45,620
l'm not talking to you for 1 0 seconds.

728
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:47,539
You can't give me the silent treatment!
You know what?

729
00:52:47,623 --> 00:52:50,166
l'm not talking to you for 1 0 seconds.
You have three seconds left.

730
00:52:50,251 --> 00:52:51,459
You know what?
You can give me the silent treatment

731
00:52:51,544 --> 00:52:53,294
all you want,
but you can't keep me from talking.

732
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,171
-What were you gonna say?
-l hope you had a lot of fun,

733
00:52:55,256 --> 00:52:57,173
because this, this is over.

734
00:52:57,258 --> 00:52:59,676
She violated your orifice
with her nasty alien probe?

735
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,011
She did it? She went in there?
All her little embryo alien babies

736
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:04,931
are gestating and hatching inside of you.
They're growing right now, probably!

737
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:07,809
You need to vomit it right now.
Yak it! Yak it right now!

738
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:09,018
Who are you?

739
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:12,188
l'm Leonardo Ponce De Leon Spitz.
Okay? l'm the key to this.

740
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:13,898
The aliens,
they want me 'cause of my site.

741
00:53:19,989 --> 00:53:20,989
Whoa, guys, right there!

742
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:26,536
Run!

743
00:53:30,416 --> 00:53:31,624
Mikaela!

744
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:51,394
Come on! We gotta move!

745
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:53,646
lt's a bomb!

746
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:04,157
You've got to get that box!

747
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:10,872
-This way.
-What? Hey! Let me out, let me out!

748
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:14,751
Oh, my God, you know how to
hot-wire a car? That's so hot!

749
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:17,045
Drive, drive, drive!
She's right there! She's right there!

750
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:19,923
Come on, come on, come on.

751
00:54:20,341 --> 00:54:22,675
Go! Go! Go! Back up the car!

752
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:25,094
Now!

753
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,014
Tongue!

754
00:54:32,645 --> 00:54:34,312
Oh, my God!

755
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:43,321
Kiss this, bitch!

756
00:54:48,577 --> 00:54:50,578
Drive, drive, drive.

757
00:54:53,374 --> 00:54:54,582
Okay, so what else
don't l know, all right?

758
00:54:54,667 --> 00:54:56,376
Since you guys forgot to mention
some minor details.

759
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:02,090
That thing you saw back there,
that was the little baby...

760
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:09,847
-Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
-Sam!

761
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:14,310
Sam!

762
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:19,983
-Sam!
-Hold on!

763
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:21,401
-Pull me up!
-Hold on!

764
00:55:23,654 --> 00:55:25,571
Sam, get back in!

765
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:30,410
l don't want to die!
We're gonna die! Oh, my God!

766
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:57,603
Jesus! Jesus!

767
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:07,405
Come here, boy.

768
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:09,991
Closer.

769
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:11,868
-Oh, my God.
-Okay.

770
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:14,370
You remember me, don't you?

771
00:56:14,455 --> 00:56:16,914
l did what you said, okay?
Just don't hurt us.

772
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:18,291
Shut up!

773
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:20,293
Sam!

774
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:30,511
Yeah! Yes, yes.

775
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:34,140
lt feels good to grab your flesh!

776
00:56:35,684 --> 00:56:40,146
l am going to kill you slowly, painfully,

777
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:44,859
but first, we have
some delicate work to do.

778
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:50,990
How l could snap your limbs off!

779
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:54,827
Doctor, examine this alien specimen.

780
00:56:55,287 --> 00:56:58,790
l'll scan you.
Let's take a look at your face.

781
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:06,589
l'm the doctor. The odd job. lnformation!

782
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:09,967
Yeah!

783
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:19,852
Beseeching my shard!

784
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:21,771
Easy or tough way?

785
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:46,504
-There they are.
-That's what l'm seeing in my head.

786
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:50,466
These symbols can lead us
to the Energon source.

787
00:57:50,551 --> 00:57:54,637
We must have the brain on the table!

788
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:57,306
-Chop, chop!
-Brain?

789
00:57:57,391 --> 00:57:58,641
What does he mean by my brain?

790
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:01,644
Well, you have something on your mind,
something l need.

791
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:03,688
Hold on. l know you're pissed.
l know you're pissed

792
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:05,690
because l tried to kill you
and it's completely understandable.

793
00:58:05,774 --> 00:58:07,191
lf somebody tried to kill me,
l'd be upset, too.

794
00:58:07,276 --> 00:58:09,861
l think that we have an opportunity here

795
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:13,072
to start anew
and develop our relationship

796
00:58:13,157 --> 00:58:15,449
and see where it leads us, okay?

797
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:18,661
So, you just call Doctor lnspector off
and let's just talk for five seconds!

798
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:19,954
Wait, wait, wait!

799
00:58:25,586 --> 00:58:28,963
-Come on! Go, go!
-Sam!

800
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:32,925
Go, go, go!

801
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:00,286
Sam!

802
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,128
Run!

803
00:59:16,178 --> 00:59:17,637
Go, go, go, go!

804
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:20,014
Here he comes!

805
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:28,231
Hide, Sam!

806
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:40,368
Weak!

807
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:45,623
Puny! Waste of metal!

808
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:51,003
Junkyard crap!

809
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:54,340
Decepticons!

810
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:06,894
Come here, boy.

811
01:00:38,427 --> 01:00:41,804
There is another source of
Energon hidden on this planet.

812
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:43,973
The boy could lead us to it.

813
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:02,325
Optimus!

814
01:01:15,589 --> 01:01:20,926
ls the future of our race not worth
a single human life?

815
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:24,764
-Up! Get up!
-You'll never stop at one!

816
01:01:26,308 --> 01:01:28,392
l'll take you all on!

817
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:12,144
Piece of tin!

818
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:16,023
Sam! Where are you?

819
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:19,777
No!

820
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:22,988
You're so weak!

821
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:54,603
The last Prime is dead!

822
01:03:03,655 --> 01:03:08,200
Sam, run. Run.

823
01:03:18,378 --> 01:03:20,212
Autobots, attack!

824
01:03:24,885 --> 01:03:27,219
Bumblebee, get them out of here!

825
01:03:40,442 --> 01:03:41,984
This is Lennox.

826
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:58,000
-That went well.
-We've lost the boy, Master.

827
01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:00,586
The Autobots
must be shielding their signals.

828
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:04,924
l can't even rely on you
to swat a simple insect?

829
01:04:06,468 --> 01:04:09,303
-One insect among seven billion!
-Shut up!

830
01:04:11,056 --> 01:04:13,057
He could be anywhere.

831
01:04:13,141 --> 01:04:16,602
Then we will force them
to find him for us!

832
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:20,356
lt's time for the world
to know of our presence.

833
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:23,567
No more disguises. No mercy!

834
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:27,571
The time has come
for my master's arrival.

835
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:36,872
Decepticons, mobilize. lt is time.

836
01:04:54,474 --> 01:04:56,725
Speaking French is so exciting!

837
01:04:56,851 --> 01:04:58,519
Oh, God, who is this?

838
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,190
Hello? l mean, bonsoir!

839
01:05:04,693 --> 01:05:07,861
-What? Who is this?
-Where is the boy?

840
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:12,866
For Pete's sakes. l'm not impressed
with your perverted mouth-breathing.

841
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:54,116
Jeez!

842
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,785
You are invading my space.
l'm gonna have to drop you.

843
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:58,078
Would you get out of here?

844
01:05:58,163 --> 01:06:00,414
l didn't come all the way across
the ocean to eat a plate of snails.

845
01:06:00,498 --> 01:06:01,790
l want to try new things.

846
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:04,251
Looks like Canadian goose poop.

847
01:06:05,629 --> 01:06:06,962
lt's nasty.

848
01:07:19,244 --> 01:07:22,579
Revenge is mine.

849
01:07:39,723 --> 01:07:41,640
Yeah!

850
01:07:43,935 --> 01:07:45,894
...definitely not a plane...

851
01:07:45,979 --> 01:07:48,063
Look, carriers don't just sink.

852
01:07:48,148 --> 01:07:51,275
...a horrible accident or a terrorist
attack or worse...

853
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:53,569
Negative. NORAD confirmed,

854
01:07:53,653 --> 01:07:57,990
projectile came from beyond our
atmosphere, inbound at 30,000 knots.

855
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:15,758
Citizens of the human hive,

856
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:19,261
your leaders have withheld the truth.

857
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:22,890
You are not alone in this universe.

858
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,685
We have lived among you, hidden,

859
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:30,355
but no more.

860
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:35,360
As you've seen,
we can destroy your cities at will,

861
01:08:37,322 --> 01:08:40,532
unless you turn over this boy.

862
01:08:45,497 --> 01:08:51,877
lf you resist us, we will destroy
the world as you know it.

863
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:54,087
What we're hearing
from the German government

864
01:08:54,172 --> 01:08:57,216
is that the worId broadcast
was a satellite hacking.

865
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:00,636
The military has just told us they have
assumed Condition Delta,

866
01:09:00,929 --> 01:09:03,472
which is the highest level
we have been at since 9/1 1 .

867
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:05,516
President Obama
is being flown to a bunker

868
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,267
somewhere in the middle
of the United States

869
01:09:07,352 --> 01:09:11,814
in the face of the worst simultaneous
attacks ever around the globe.

870
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:17,277
The aircraft carrier USS Roosevelt goes
down off the East Coast, all hands lost.

871
01:09:17,362 --> 01:09:20,531
WorIdwide casualties
are in the neighborhood of 7,000,

872
01:09:20,615 --> 01:09:22,324
but that number could climb.

873
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:23,450
lt's still too early to tell.

874
01:09:23,535 --> 01:09:25,953
What we need to ask now is,
"Who and why?"

875
01:09:26,037 --> 01:09:28,956
The FBl is still trying to locate
the boy, Sam Witwicky.

876
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:31,750
We believe they have information
about the attacks.

877
01:09:31,835 --> 01:09:34,169
The FBl, ClA and lnterpol

878
01:09:34,254 --> 01:09:37,589
are all seeking the cooperation
of worIdwide law enforcement.

879
01:09:37,674 --> 01:09:39,800
You need to listen to this, man.
You gotta check this out.

880
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:42,511
-They have a traffic-camera spotting...
-They have a picture of me, man.

881
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:46,014
We're dead, bro.
FBl, ClA, we are wanted fugitives now!

882
01:09:46,266 --> 01:09:47,307
l just need you to focus

883
01:09:47,392 --> 01:09:48,350
-for one minute, man.
-Just stop.

884
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:50,018
This thing has blown up
to a whole other level, all right?

885
01:09:50,103 --> 01:09:51,770
You know what? Give me this thing.
They can track us.

886
01:09:51,855 --> 01:09:53,814
-Do you see this?
-What?

887
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:58,569
They can track us?
Like, satellite track us?

888
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:00,612
Okay, l'm not even with you guys!

889
01:10:00,697 --> 01:10:03,031
Technically, l'm like a hostage.
This is kidnapping...

890
01:10:03,116 --> 01:10:04,408
-Enough is...
-Yo, Leo!

891
01:10:04,742 --> 01:10:06,869
This thing's gonna
give me a heart attack, l swear.

892
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:09,329
-That's 'cause you is a wuss.
-You guys forced me into that car, right?

893
01:10:09,414 --> 01:10:10,372
l think he's scared.

894
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:13,000
Hey, Mudflap, what are we gonna do
with this shrimp taco?

895
01:10:13,084 --> 01:10:14,418
Let's pop a cap in his ass,
throw him in the trunk

896
01:10:14,502 --> 01:10:16,044
and then nobody gonna know nothing,
know what l mean?

897
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:19,047
-Not in my trunk.
-Yo, bumper cars? l'm hearing you.

898
01:10:19,132 --> 01:10:21,341
Okay? l'm right here and l can hear you!

899
01:10:21,426 --> 01:10:23,594
No one's popping any caps
in any asses, okay?

900
01:10:23,678 --> 01:10:25,220
l've had a hell of a day!

901
01:10:26,306 --> 01:10:28,724
Why don't you get a haircut
with your bitch ass?

902
01:10:28,808 --> 01:10:29,933
Go whine to your boyfriend!

903
01:10:30,018 --> 01:10:32,227
Listen, Sam, l know what l'm gonna do,
man. Look, l'm just going to go

904
01:10:32,312 --> 01:10:33,353
to the authorities and tell them the truth.

905
01:10:33,438 --> 01:10:34,438
Like, l had nothing to do with this.

906
01:10:34,522 --> 01:10:36,064
-So, l'm not an accomplice.
-Hey, you wanted this, right?

907
01:10:36,149 --> 01:10:37,482
You wanted the real deal?
Well, that's what this is.

908
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,901
Wake up! You're in the middle of it!

909
01:10:38,985 --> 01:10:41,320
You want to run? Go ahead!
No one's stopping you.

910
01:10:42,322 --> 01:10:43,947
Stop complaining.

911
01:11:20,193 --> 01:11:21,693
What is the meaning of this?

912
01:11:22,028 --> 01:11:23,946
You dare point a gun at me?

913
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:27,783
You want a piece of me?
l will tear you apart!

914
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:32,162
Drop your weapons! Drop your weapons!

915
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:33,705
-Tell them to lower their weapons!
-Tell them first.

916
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:34,831
Tell them to lower their weapons.

917
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:36,917
Major, there's nothing l can do.
Talk to him.

918
01:11:37,001 --> 01:11:38,877
Your NEST team is deactivated, Major.

919
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:41,880
You are to cease
anti-Decepticon operations

920
01:11:41,965 --> 01:11:44,299
and return to Diego Garcia
pending further orders.

921
01:11:44,384 --> 01:11:46,760
No, we take our orders directly
from Chairman Morshower, sir.

922
01:11:46,844 --> 01:11:48,637
Well, l'll see your Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff

923
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:51,223
and l will raise you
a President of the United States.

924
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:52,766
l have operational command now.

925
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:55,060
An alien blood feud
has been brought to our shores

926
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:56,770
for which our soldiers
are paying the price.

927
01:11:57,271 --> 01:11:58,897
The secret is out!

928
01:11:58,982 --> 01:12:02,442
This is our war now and we will win it
as we always have,

929
01:12:02,527 --> 01:12:04,444
with a coordinated military strategy.

930
01:12:04,529 --> 01:12:07,489
This fool is terribly misinformed.

931
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:08,949
You're gonna need every asset
that you've got.

932
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:10,742
What we need is to draw up battle plans

933
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:12,995
while we explore
every possible diplomatic solution.

934
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:14,579
Like what, handing over the kid?

935
01:12:15,915 --> 01:12:17,749
All options are being considered.

936
01:12:18,376 --> 01:12:22,295
Whatever the Decepticons are after,
this is just the start.

937
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:25,465
-There is no negotiating with them.
-l'm ordering you to stand down.

938
01:12:25,550 --> 01:12:29,636
You won't be needing this anymore.
Get your assets back to base!

939
01:12:29,721 --> 01:12:32,931
And take that pile of scrap metal back
to Diego Garcia.

940
01:12:34,142 --> 01:12:35,475
Let's go!

941
01:12:36,436 --> 01:12:40,647
l really don't like that dude.
He's an asshole.

942
01:12:40,732 --> 01:12:43,233
Autobots, report to hangar for transport.

943
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:48,655
-lronhide, we should leave this planet.
-That's not what Optimus would want.

944
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,843
There's nothing
that you could have done.

945
01:13:14,474 --> 01:13:16,558
-You okay?
-Yeah.

946
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:22,564
Bee, if you hate me, l understand.

947
01:13:30,490 --> 01:13:33,533
l messed up. l'm sorry.

948
01:13:35,578 --> 01:13:39,456
Young fella, you are the person
l care about most in my life.

949
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:42,626
lf there's anything you need,
l won't be far away.

950
01:13:44,921 --> 01:13:48,590
He's dead because of me. He came
here to protect me and he's dead.

951
01:13:49,008 --> 01:13:51,760
There's some things
you just can't change.

952
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:56,014
So, his sacrifice for us would
not have been in vain. Hallelujah!

953
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:59,601
l'm gonna make it right.
l'm going to turn myself in.

954
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:01,853
We... We've got to stick together.

955
01:14:06,526 --> 01:14:10,195
-You're not going to do that.
-Yes, l am.

956
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:18,036
Everything we worked for
will be wiped out in one day!

957
01:14:20,665 --> 01:14:22,833
-You two...
-Huh?

958
01:14:22,917 --> 01:14:24,042
Hey, you know the glyphs?

959
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:26,586
These? The symbols that have been
rattling around in my head?

960
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:31,383
That's old school, yo.
That's, like... That's Cybertronian.

961
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:33,009
That's some serious stuff, right there.

962
01:14:33,094 --> 01:14:36,138
They gotta mean something,
like a message or like a map.

963
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:37,639
Like a map to an Energon source!

964
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:40,976
-Can you read this?
-Read?

965
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:43,353
No. We don't really do much reading.
Not so much.

966
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:45,480
lf you can't read it,
we gotta find somebody who can.

967
01:14:45,565 --> 01:14:47,190
Look who came sashaying back!

968
01:14:47,275 --> 01:14:48,859
Hair growing like a Chia Pet.
Look at him.

969
01:14:48,943 --> 01:14:50,777
l had a bit
of a mild panic attack earlier, right?

970
01:14:50,862 --> 01:14:51,987
That's 'cause you're a pussy.

971
01:14:52,071 --> 01:14:53,947
l think l'm allowed that,
considering what l've been through.

972
01:14:54,574 --> 01:14:55,657
l heard you have a problem.

973
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:58,743
-l think l know someone who can help.
-Who?

974
01:14:58,828 --> 01:14:59,995
Robo-Warrior.

975
01:15:03,583 --> 01:15:04,791
This guy, Robo-Warrior,

976
01:15:04,876 --> 01:15:07,252
everything about anything alien,
he's supposed to know.

977
01:15:07,378 --> 01:15:08,712
One time we revenge-hacked his site

978
01:15:08,796 --> 01:15:13,216
and maybe l saw some
of your alien drawings or whatever.

979
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:27,606
This is it. Yep.

980
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:28,857
Deli. Good front!

981
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:31,776
All right, wait here.
l'll give you the go/no go. All right?

982
01:15:32,278 --> 01:15:34,946
Number 42, we got your kishka, knish,

983
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:38,158
kasha-varnishka
and kreplach combo right here.

984
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:39,576
Cash only. Who's next?

985
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:42,954
l told you to cure the lox in the brine
and then smoke it.

986
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:44,623
Ma, you want me
to cut my hand off, or what?

987
01:15:44,707 --> 01:15:46,208
You... You ruined
a beautiful piece of fish, you retard!

988
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:47,626
l'm like a ninja with a blade.
lt's an art form.

989
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:48,919
Give me your money. Get out of here!

990
01:15:49,003 --> 01:15:52,923
Hey, Sal! Watch your reach, huh?
Take a number, young man.

991
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:54,925
Robo-Warrior.

992
01:15:56,636 --> 01:15:58,803
-Know him?
-l never heard of him.

993
01:15:58,888 --> 01:16:01,223
You never heard of
TheRealEffingDeal.com?

994
01:16:01,307 --> 01:16:03,850
You must be talking about that
amateur-hour blog operation

995
01:16:03,935 --> 01:16:07,062
-with Game Boy-level security.
-Robo-Warrior.

996
01:16:08,189 --> 01:16:11,024
lt's him! lt's him!
That's the guy right there! That's him!

997
01:16:12,276 --> 01:16:13,526
No.

998
01:16:14,195 --> 01:16:16,404
-You got to be kidding me.
-All right, meat store's closed!

999
01:16:16,489 --> 01:16:18,865
-Everybody out! Out, right now!
-When he says to go,

1000
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:20,533
-you go.
-That means you, lady, right now.

1001
01:16:20,618 --> 01:16:22,744
-Wait a minute. You know this guy?
-We're old friends.

1002
01:16:22,828 --> 01:16:26,289
Old friends? You're the case
that shut down Sector Seven,

1003
01:16:26,374 --> 01:16:27,707
got the kibosh, disbanded.

1004
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:31,044
No more security clearance,
no retirement, no nothing.

1005
01:16:31,128 --> 01:16:34,089
All 'cause of you
and your little criminal girlfriend.

1006
01:16:34,173 --> 01:16:38,468
-Look at her now, so mature.
-Moron! Where's the whitefish?

1007
01:16:38,552 --> 01:16:40,428
Hey! Don't touch me with the pig.

1008
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:42,097
-Yakov!
-What?

1009
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:44,224
You don't get
Christmas bonuses standing around!

1010
01:16:44,308 --> 01:16:46,101
You want those new teeth
you saw on SkyMall?

1011
01:16:46,185 --> 01:16:48,395
-lt's my dream.
-Help her out.

1012
01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:50,063
You live with your mama?

1013
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:51,481
No, my mama lives with me.
lt's a big difference.

1014
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:53,441
They got your face all over the news,
alien boy.

1015
01:16:53,526 --> 01:16:55,902
-Yeah, l know.
-And NBE One's still kicking, huh?

1016
01:16:55,987 --> 01:16:58,154
How did that happen? Don't answer.

1017
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,615
l don't know what you're hiding,
but l don't want anything to do with it.

1018
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:03,451
So, good-bye. You never saw me.
l got bagels to schmear. Vanish.

1019
01:17:03,536 --> 01:17:05,996
Can you give me five seconds?
Look, hold on, l need your help.

1020
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:08,665
Really? You need my help?

1021
01:17:08,749 --> 01:17:11,376
l need...
Look, l am slowly losing my mind.

1022
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,086
Okay, l had a little crab-bot,

1023
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:15,297
plunged a device deep into
the soft tissues of my brain

1024
01:17:15,381 --> 01:17:18,216
and started projecting little alien
symbols like a freaking home movie!

1025
01:17:18,301 --> 01:17:21,052
And on top of that, l'm a wanted fugitive.
So, you think you got it rough?

1026
01:17:21,137 --> 01:17:23,305
You said it projected images
off your brain?

1027
01:17:23,389 --> 01:17:25,974
-Right.
-Meat locker, now!

1028
01:17:26,726 --> 01:17:27,976
Dead pigs.

1029
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:30,228
What you're about to see is top secret.

1030
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:33,023
Do not tell my mother.

1031
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:36,151
-Swine flu. Not good.
-Now you know.

1032
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:39,195
Next time you eat a goat or a pig,
there's a story behind it.

1033
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:40,572
Sad little story.

1034
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:41,823
An entire city flat.
How do you explain that?

1035
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:42,991
Are you saying you believe
in aliens now?

1036
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:46,244
Okay, files, files.
We're talking about symbols.

1037
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:49,539
Hey, still radioactive. Hands off.

1038
01:17:50,333 --> 01:17:52,250
Okay, Cube-brain.

1039
01:17:52,877 --> 01:17:55,086
Any of these look
like the symbols you saw?

1040
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:56,504
Where'd you get these?

1041
01:17:56,589 --> 01:18:00,258
Before l got fired,
l poached S-7's crown jewel,

1042
01:18:00,343 --> 01:18:05,722
over 75 years of alien research,
which points to one inescapable fact.

1043
01:18:05,806 --> 01:18:09,768
The Transformers,
they've been here a long, long time.

1044
01:18:10,144 --> 01:18:11,269
How do l know?

1045
01:18:12,438 --> 01:18:14,272
Archeologists found
these unexplained markings

1046
01:18:14,357 --> 01:18:16,608
in ancient ruins all over the world.

1047
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:19,110
China. Egypt. Greece.

1048
01:18:20,071 --> 01:18:21,654
Shot in 1 932.

1049
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:23,573
These the symbols
you're seeing in your head?

1050
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:26,242
-Yeah.
-Same ones over here, right?

1051
01:18:26,327 --> 01:18:31,122
So, tell me, how did they end up
all drawing the same things?

1052
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:35,126
Aliens. And l think some of them stayed.

1053
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:38,129
Check this out. Project Black Knife.

1054
01:18:38,631 --> 01:18:43,093
Robots in disguise,
hiding here all along.

1055
01:18:43,177 --> 01:18:46,471
We detected radioactive signatures
all across the country.

1056
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:50,058
l pleaded on my knees with S-7
to investigate it,

1057
01:18:50,142 --> 01:18:53,686
but they said the readings
were infinitesimal,

1058
01:18:53,771 --> 01:18:56,231
that l was obsessed.

1059
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:58,066
Me. Can you imagine that?

1060
01:18:58,150 --> 01:19:01,277
Yeah. Megatron said that there
was another Energon source here.

1061
01:19:01,362 --> 01:19:03,238
-On Earth. Another source?
-On Earth.

1062
01:19:03,322 --> 01:19:06,199
Okay? And that these symbols,
maps in my head, would lead him there.

1063
01:19:06,283 --> 01:19:08,034
You talk to your Autobot friends
about this?

1064
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:09,411
No, no, no, the source is before them.

1065
01:19:09,495 --> 01:19:11,329
Whatever the Energon source is,
it predates them.

1066
01:19:11,414 --> 01:19:12,497
lt's before them.

1067
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:14,582
-So, it comes before them.
-Correct.

1068
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:18,044
Well, then we're porked,
unless we can talk to a Decepticon.

1069
01:19:18,379 --> 01:19:20,213
l mean,
l'm not on speaking terms with them.

1070
01:19:20,297 --> 01:19:22,006
Actually, l am.

1071
01:19:26,679 --> 01:19:28,054
Let me out!

1072
01:19:28,139 --> 01:19:30,390
-This is going to be a little bit sad.
-Open it.

1073
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:34,227
l will have so many Decepticons
on your butt!

1074
01:19:34,311 --> 01:19:35,770
Hey, behave!

1075
01:19:35,855 --> 01:19:37,689
-What is it, a Decepticon?
-Yeah.

1076
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:39,566
-And you're training him?
-l'm trying to.

1077
01:19:40,234 --> 01:19:43,153
l spent my whole adult life combing
the planet for aliens,

1078
01:19:43,446 --> 01:19:46,573
and you're carrying around one
in your purse like a little Chihuahua.

1079
01:19:47,158 --> 01:19:49,617
Do you want a throwdown,
you pubic 'fro-head?

1080
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:52,871
l'm sorry.
l'm so sorry about your eye, you know,

1081
01:19:52,955 --> 01:19:56,082
but, if you're a good boy,
then l'm not gonna torch your other eye.

1082
01:19:56,167 --> 01:19:57,584
Okay? l'm not gonna torch it.

1083
01:19:57,668 --> 01:20:01,045
Just tell me
what these symbols are, please.

1084
01:20:02,256 --> 01:20:03,256
All right.

1085
01:20:04,967 --> 01:20:07,594
l know that.
That's the language of the Primes.

1086
01:20:08,512 --> 01:20:11,181
l don't read it, but these guys...

1087
01:20:11,265 --> 01:20:13,766
Where the frick did you find photos
of these guys?

1088
01:20:13,851 --> 01:20:17,645
-ls this they?
-Yeah. Seekers, pal. Oldest of the old.

1089
01:20:18,063 --> 01:20:21,316
They've been here thousands of years,
looking for something. l don't know what.

1090
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:24,903
Nobody tells me nothing, but they'll
translate those symbols for you.

1091
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:27,322
-And l know where to find them.
-Show us.

1092
01:20:27,406 --> 01:20:28,740
Yeah.

1093
01:20:32,411 --> 01:20:34,412
The closest one's in Washington.

1094
01:20:36,749 --> 01:20:41,753
Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.
Land of dreams in there.

1095
01:20:42,588 --> 01:20:44,506
All l ever wanted to be was an astronaut.

1096
01:20:46,467 --> 01:20:48,551
-Hold those.
-What is that?

1097
01:20:49,428 --> 01:20:51,554
What? l wear them when l'm in a funk.

1098
01:20:52,598 --> 01:20:56,142
So does Giambi, Jeter.
lt's a baseball thing. Okay.

1099
01:20:56,227 --> 01:20:57,727
Watches synchronized,
sharp mind and empty bladder.

1100
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:01,689
You get caught, demand an attorney
and don't ever say my name.

1101
01:21:01,774 --> 01:21:03,525
Okay, take one of these pills.
Slip it under your tongue.

1102
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:05,902
lt's the high-concentrate polymer
they put in Oreo cookies.

1103
01:21:05,986 --> 01:21:07,695
Tricks the polygraph every time.

1104
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:09,531
Okay. Now, let's get this show
on the road.

1105
01:21:10,491 --> 01:21:12,075
No, listen, l can't do this.

1106
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:14,077
l'm not some alien bounty hunter, guys.
l'm not gonna do this.

1107
01:21:14,161 --> 01:21:16,704
-Guards have guns. l don't want to die.
-Kid, kid, kid.

1108
01:21:16,789 --> 01:21:19,707
You compromise this mission,
you are dead to me.

1109
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:22,377
Now look into my eyes
and tighten up that sphincter.

1110
01:21:23,504 --> 01:21:24,712
The museum is now closing.

1111
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:27,715
Yo, baba! Bad news, bro!
Ran out of toilet paper!

1112
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:29,092
You got any out here?
Please tell me you do.

1113
01:21:29,176 --> 01:21:32,178
Sir! l suggest you get in there.
The museum is closed!

1114
01:21:32,263 --> 01:21:34,681
Listen, man, l understand that,
but as you can see, this is important.

1115
01:21:34,765 --> 01:21:36,683
All right? Thumper dumper.
l got to go. All right.

1116
01:21:36,767 --> 01:21:39,686
Sir, you are a grown,
naked man around children.

1117
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:42,689
-Pull your pants up and exit the building.
-l'm not going anywhere.

1118
01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:50,071
-You got that paper, right, sir?
-You should be embarrassed.

1119
01:21:50,155 --> 01:21:52,282
This is a family museum, sir.

1120
01:22:10,259 --> 01:22:11,759
What is going on here?

1121
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:16,347
How many times can you get tased
in the nuts before you can't have kids?

1122
01:22:16,432 --> 01:22:18,641
You are an amateur, man,
a rank amateur.

1123
01:22:22,521 --> 01:22:24,731
We just downed five guards.
Five guards.

1124
01:22:24,815 --> 01:22:26,482
-Get your stuff and get out of here.
-Give me a second here.

1125
01:22:26,567 --> 01:22:28,276
l got to get the tracker, all right.

1126
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,778
-Be good.
-l'm claustrophobic.

1127
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:51,007
Look, look. Follow him. Follow him.
He knows where he's going.

1128
01:22:56,722 --> 01:22:57,889
-He knows something.
-What?

1129
01:22:57,973 --> 01:22:59,015
He knows something.

1130
01:23:05,022 --> 01:23:05,980
You got what l got?

1131
01:23:06,065 --> 01:23:07,732
-Yeah.
-Blackbird.

1132
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:12,320
There he is.

1133
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:16,032
This guy's a legend,
like the Chairman of the Board!

1134
01:23:16,116 --> 01:23:20,328
Yo, freshman, point the shard
and watch the magic happen.

1135
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:29,462
Shit. lt's a Decepticon!

1136
01:23:29,755 --> 01:23:31,923
-Decepticon?
-Decepticon?

1137
01:23:32,216 --> 01:23:34,050
Behind the MiG now!

1138
01:23:46,355 --> 01:23:49,357
What sort of hideous
mausoleum is this?

1139
01:23:50,442 --> 01:23:52,694
Answer me, pawns and knaves!

1140
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:56,114
Show yourselves
or suffer my infinite wrath!

1141
01:23:57,324 --> 01:24:00,284
You little spinal-cord-based organisms!

1142
01:24:01,412 --> 01:24:02,662
Bugger it!

1143
01:24:03,163 --> 01:24:07,667
Behold the eternal glory of Jetfire!

1144
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:10,128
Prepare for remote systems override!

1145
01:24:10,212 --> 01:24:12,755
-l tell you, this guy did not age well.
-l don't think he's gonna hurt us.

1146
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:15,133
l command these doors to open.

1147
01:24:15,217 --> 01:24:19,178
Fire! l said, fire!

1148
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:21,389
Bollocks!

1149
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:25,059
-Damn these worthless parts.
-Wait a second!

1150
01:24:25,144 --> 01:24:28,479
ltchy, wretched rust in my arse!

1151
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:32,734
The museum is going to be very angry.
Very angry.

1152
01:24:32,818 --> 01:24:34,485
We gotta catch that plane.

1153
01:24:37,364 --> 01:24:41,826
-Right. l'm on a mission.
-Wait, wait, wait, wait!

1154
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:43,745
-What do you want?
-Look, we just want to talk!

1155
01:24:43,829 --> 01:24:45,580
l have no time to talk. l'm on a mission.

1156
01:24:45,664 --> 01:24:48,916
l'm a mercenary doom-bringer.
What planet am l on?

1157
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:50,376
-Earth.
-Earth?

1158
01:24:50,461 --> 01:24:55,506
Terrible name for a planet.
Might as well call it "Dirt." Planet "Dirt."

1159
01:24:55,591 --> 01:24:59,010
Tell me,
is that robot civil war still going on?

1160
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:00,762
-Who's winning?
-The Decepticons.

1161
01:25:01,847 --> 01:25:05,224
-Well, l changed sides to the Autobots.
-What do you mean, "changed sides"?

1162
01:25:05,309 --> 01:25:08,811
lt's a choice.
lt's an intensely personal decision.

1163
01:25:08,896 --> 01:25:12,565
So much negativity.
Who wants to live a life filled with hate?

1164
01:25:12,649 --> 01:25:13,649
You mean you don't have to work

1165
01:25:13,734 --> 01:25:15,443
for those miserable,
freaking Decepticons?

1166
01:25:15,527 --> 01:25:19,071
lf Decepticons had their way,
they'd destroy the whole universe.

1167
01:25:19,364 --> 01:25:21,949
l'm changing sides. l'm changing sides,
too, warrior goddess.

1168
01:25:22,034 --> 01:25:24,202
-Who's your little Autobot?
-You're cute.

1169
01:25:24,286 --> 01:25:27,330
Name's Wheelie. Yeah.
Say my name, say my name.

1170
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:29,624
What are you allowing
to happen to your foot just now?

1171
01:25:29,708 --> 01:25:30,833
At least he's faithful, Sam.

1172
01:25:30,918 --> 01:25:33,878
Yeah, well, he's faithful and he's nude
and he's perverted.

1173
01:25:35,464 --> 01:25:36,464
Can you just... Can you stop?

1174
01:25:36,548 --> 01:25:37,965
-Hey, what are you doing?
-lt's just something

1175
01:25:38,050 --> 01:25:39,967
to think about. l won't argue with...
What were you saying?

1176
01:25:40,052 --> 01:25:44,138
l told you my name was Jetfire,
so stop judging me.

1177
01:25:44,223 --> 01:25:45,640
Somebody shit the bed this morning.

1178
01:25:45,724 --> 01:25:47,308
-Look at this guy.
-l have issues of my own.

1179
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:48,893
And it started with my mother!

1180
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:51,437
My ancestors
have been here for centuries.

1181
01:25:51,522 --> 01:25:54,482
My father, he was a wheel,
the first wheel.

1182
01:25:54,566 --> 01:25:56,818
-Do you know what he transformed into?
-No.

1183
01:25:56,902 --> 01:25:57,944
Nothing!

1184
01:25:58,028 --> 01:26:01,697
But he did so with honor,
dignity, damn it!

1185
01:26:08,539 --> 01:26:09,539
Bollocks.

1186
01:26:09,915 --> 01:26:12,083
My boosters are fried.

1187
01:26:14,086 --> 01:26:15,294
l think we can help each other.

1188
01:26:15,379 --> 01:26:18,256
You know things l don't know.
l know things you don't know, l do.

1189
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:20,758
l don't think he knows anything.
Honestly, l don't.

1190
01:26:22,553 --> 01:26:24,846
l could do this all day.
lt comes in waves, these vivid symbols.

1191
01:26:24,930 --> 01:26:27,890
They're symbols, but they're in my mind.
You see, all this is in my mind

1192
01:26:27,975 --> 01:26:29,851
and Megatron wants what's in my mind.

1193
01:26:29,935 --> 01:26:33,145
-Him and someone called The Fallen.
-The Fallen? l know him.

1194
01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:36,482
He left me here to rust.
The original Decepticon.

1195
01:26:36,567 --> 01:26:40,361
He's terrible to work for.
lt's always apocalypse, chaos, crisis.

1196
01:26:40,445 --> 01:26:42,488
These transcriptions,
they were part of my mission,

1197
01:26:42,573 --> 01:26:43,531
The Fallen's search.

1198
01:26:43,615 --> 01:26:47,201
l remember now,
for the Dagger's Tip, and the key.

1199
01:26:47,286 --> 01:26:49,370
Slow down. The Dagger's Tip? The key?
What are you talking about?

1200
01:26:49,454 --> 01:26:53,958
No time to explain. Hold on, everybody!
Stay still or you'll die!

1201
01:27:20,819 --> 01:27:21,903
Well, that wasn't so bad.

1202
01:27:21,987 --> 01:27:23,654
l just hope we're still on the right planet.

1203
01:27:23,739 --> 01:27:25,698
Hey, that freaking hurt!

1204
01:27:26,992 --> 01:27:28,326
Oh, my God.

1205
01:27:35,334 --> 01:27:36,834
Oh, God.

1206
01:27:41,298 --> 01:27:43,257
Oh, my God, what a beautiful face.

1207
01:27:43,342 --> 01:27:47,303
This would be a perfect moment,
except you landed on my testicles.

1208
01:27:47,387 --> 01:27:49,013
Please, get off.

1209
01:27:49,932 --> 01:27:52,391
God, my balls.

1210
01:27:53,602 --> 01:27:54,852
Sam!

1211
01:27:55,938 --> 01:27:59,065
-Where are we? Simmons!
-Hey! Yeah!

1212
01:27:59,358 --> 01:28:04,111
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
What is this? lt's Vegas.

1213
01:28:04,196 --> 01:28:06,030
-You guys okay?
-Yeah.

1214
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:08,616
Hey, l think we're in Vegas!

1215
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:12,286
That really, really hurt.
You're just lucky that l didn't get hurt!

1216
01:28:12,371 --> 01:28:15,039
People could have gotten killed, okay?
And if l would have gotten hurt,

1217
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:17,083
-you would have heard...
-Shut up.

1218
01:28:17,167 --> 01:28:21,462
l told you l was opening a space bridge.
lt's the fastest way to travel to Egypt.

1219
01:28:21,546 --> 01:28:24,382
When did you... When did you tell us?
You didn't tell us anything.

1220
01:28:24,466 --> 01:28:26,217
You didn't tell us anything.
Why are we in Egypt?

1221
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:30,888
Don't you get snippy with me, fleshling!
You were duly informed!

1222
01:28:30,973 --> 01:28:32,640
Can you just stop for a second?
Can you focus?

1223
01:28:32,724 --> 01:28:33,891
Can you tell us why we're in Egypt

1224
01:28:33,976 --> 01:28:36,644
so we can all have a little bit of
semblance of peace of mind?

1225
01:28:36,728 --> 01:28:40,147
This planet was visited
by our race once before,

1226
01:28:40,232 --> 01:28:42,984
by our earliest ancestors, millennia ago.

1227
01:28:43,068 --> 01:28:45,987
They were on an exploratory mission
to harvest Energon,

1228
01:28:46,071 --> 01:28:48,656
the lifeblood of our race.

1229
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:53,577
Without it, we'll all perish, oxidize
and rust, like my wretched self!

1230
01:28:53,662 --> 01:28:57,581
Do you have any idea what it's like
to slowly fall apart and die?

1231
01:28:57,666 --> 01:29:00,584
Let's not get episodic, okay, old-timer?

1232
01:29:01,378 --> 01:29:06,590
Beginning, middle, end.
Facts. Details. Condense. Plot. Tell it.

1233
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:11,512
Somewhere buried in this desert,
our ancestors built a great machine.

1234
01:29:11,596 --> 01:29:15,808
lt harvests Energon by destroying suns.

1235
01:29:15,892 --> 01:29:17,601
-Destroy suns?
-You mean blow them up?

1236
01:29:17,686 --> 01:29:19,562
Yes. You see, in the beginning,

1237
01:29:19,646 --> 01:29:22,773
there were seven Primes,
our original leaders.

1238
01:29:22,858 --> 01:29:26,944
And they set out into the universe,
seeking distant suns to harvest.

1239
01:29:27,612 --> 01:29:33,034
The Primes set out with one rule,
never destroy a planet with life,

1240
01:29:33,118 --> 01:29:36,037
until one of them tried to defy this rule.

1241
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:40,374
And his name forevermore
was The Fallen.

1242
01:29:42,127 --> 01:29:44,503
He despised the human race

1243
01:29:45,714 --> 01:29:49,884
and he wanted to kill you all
by turning on that machine.

1244
01:29:49,968 --> 01:29:54,013
The only way to activate it
is with a legendary key

1245
01:29:54,097 --> 01:29:57,183
called the Matrix of Leadership.

1246
01:30:03,482 --> 01:30:07,860
A great battle took place over
possession of the Matrix.

1247
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:15,159
The Fallen was stronger than
his brothers,

1248
01:30:16,536 --> 01:30:20,998
so they had no choice
but to steal and hide it from him.

1249
01:30:21,625 --> 01:30:26,462
ln the ultimate sacrifice, they gave
their lives to seal the Matrix away

1250
01:30:26,546 --> 01:30:29,715
in a tomb made of
their very own bodies,

1251
01:30:30,467 --> 01:30:33,344
a tomb we cannot find.

1252
01:30:34,805 --> 01:30:40,476
Somewhere, buried in this desert,
that deadly machine remains.

1253
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,603
The Fallen knows where it is

1254
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:48,317
and if he finds the tomb of the Primes,
your world will be no more.

1255
01:30:48,693 --> 01:30:50,319
Okay, so how do we stop him?

1256
01:30:50,403 --> 01:30:52,780
Only a Prime can defeat The Fallen.

1257
01:30:52,864 --> 01:30:54,448
Optimus Prime?

1258
01:30:56,868 --> 01:30:58,994
So, you've met a Prime?

1259
01:30:59,079 --> 01:31:02,164
Why, you must have met
a great descendant.

1260
01:31:02,249 --> 01:31:05,376
ls he alive, here on this planet?

1261
01:31:06,086 --> 01:31:08,379
He sacrificed himself to save me.

1262
01:31:08,839 --> 01:31:10,297
So, he's dead.

1263
01:31:10,382 --> 01:31:14,468
Without a Prime, it's impossible.
No one else could stop The Fallen.

1264
01:31:14,553 --> 01:31:18,556
So, the same energy that's gonna be
used to reactivate the machine,

1265
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:21,267
could that energy somehow be used
to reactivate Optimus

1266
01:31:21,351 --> 01:31:22,393
and bring him back to life?

1267
01:31:22,477 --> 01:31:27,189
lt was never designed for that purpose,
but it's an energy like no other.

1268
01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:31,152
So, then how do you get us to the Matrix
before the Decepticons get to me?

1269
01:31:31,236 --> 01:31:34,446
Follow your mind, your map,
your symbols.

1270
01:31:34,531 --> 01:31:37,158
What you carved in the sand,
it's your clue.

1271
01:31:37,242 --> 01:31:42,454
When dawn alights the Dagger's Tip,
Three Kings will reveal the doorway!

1272
01:31:42,539 --> 01:31:44,498
Find the doorway!

1273
01:31:44,583 --> 01:31:46,458
Go now! Go!

1274
01:31:46,543 --> 01:31:49,461
That was my mission.
lt's your mission now.

1275
01:31:49,546 --> 01:31:53,841
Go before the Decepticons find me
and find you.

1276
01:31:59,764 --> 01:32:01,682
Okay, here's what my ClA contact says.

1277
01:32:01,766 --> 01:32:05,311
Ancient Sumerians used to call
the Gulf ofAqaba the "Dagger's Tip."

1278
01:32:05,395 --> 01:32:07,271
-That's the Dagger's Tip.
-lt's part of the Red Sea.

1279
01:32:07,355 --> 01:32:09,523
lt divides Egypt and Jordan
like the tip of a blade.

1280
01:32:09,608 --> 01:32:13,444
29.5 degrees north, 35 east. Here it is.

1281
01:32:13,945 --> 01:32:15,905
First thing we've got to do
is get Optimus to the Dagger's Tip.

1282
01:32:15,989 --> 01:32:18,449
How are you gonna get him
halfway around the world?

1283
01:32:18,533 --> 01:32:19,700
l'm gonna make a call.

1284
01:32:22,621 --> 01:32:23,913
We got cops!

1285
01:32:30,253 --> 01:32:31,295
l can't go to prison, guys.

1286
01:32:35,217 --> 01:32:37,801
Sam, we got to get off this road
and lay low.

1287
01:32:48,355 --> 01:32:50,231
Man, stupid cops!

1288
01:32:50,315 --> 01:32:52,524
This is what's called
blending in like a ninja.

1289
01:32:52,609 --> 01:32:56,403
-Shut up or l'll blend my fist in your face.
-They're gone.

1290
01:32:56,488 --> 01:32:59,114
Okay, we're running out of time.
l gotta make the call to Lennox...

1291
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:00,532
You're on the Worldwide Wanted List.

1292
01:33:00,617 --> 01:33:03,244
Try calling one base,
they'll track you here in seconds.

1293
01:33:03,328 --> 01:33:05,955
-ClA is all over this place!
-You're gonna call.

1294
01:33:11,503 --> 01:33:14,088
-Okay. That's a good idea.
-All right.

1295
01:33:14,172 --> 01:33:16,590
l mean, l just had my mind
on other things,

1296
01:33:16,675 --> 01:33:18,133
like winding up in an Egyptian prison.

1297
01:33:20,845 --> 01:33:23,180
NEST departure, 2100 hours.

1298
01:33:24,516 --> 01:33:28,310
So, we're shipping him back to base.
This is such a mistake.

1299
01:33:33,692 --> 01:33:35,901
Major Lennox, phone call.

1300
01:33:36,695 --> 01:33:39,780
Lennox, l'm with the kid. The kid. You
know, the one with the attitude, right?

1301
01:33:39,864 --> 01:33:41,448
We need the truck. The truck.

1302
01:33:41,533 --> 01:33:44,285
We got a possible resurrection
going on over here.

1303
01:33:44,369 --> 01:33:48,622
You're not gonna believe where we are.
Code Tut, as in King Tutankhamen.

1304
01:33:48,707 --> 01:33:50,249
Back of a $1 bill.

1305
01:33:50,709 --> 01:33:57,006
Coordinates for airdrop, 29.5 north,
34.88 east. Write it down. Write it.

1306
01:33:57,090 --> 01:33:59,800
Oh, my God. l got to go. Okay.
Heat comes.

1307
01:33:59,884 --> 01:34:01,427
Wait, who are you?

1308
01:34:02,679 --> 01:34:05,139
Wait. lt's me. Leo. Me. Leo. Leo. Leo.

1309
01:34:05,223 --> 01:34:06,307
Cops are coming right now.
We need to go!

1310
01:34:06,391 --> 01:34:08,183
Move, move, move, move.

1311
01:34:09,311 --> 01:34:13,063
Coordinates, 29.5 north, 34.88 east.

1312
01:34:13,148 --> 01:34:15,607
Tip of the Red Sea. Gulf ofAqaba.

1313
01:34:15,692 --> 01:34:18,235
Egypt? Are you serious?

1314
01:34:19,863 --> 01:34:20,946
Sir.

1315
01:34:25,243 --> 01:34:28,078
Even if we could figure out a way
to get big man over there,

1316
01:34:28,163 --> 01:34:30,831
how is this little kid supposed
to bring him back to life?

1317
01:34:30,915 --> 01:34:34,251
Look, l don't know,
but we got to trust him.

1318
01:34:36,588 --> 01:34:37,921
Okay, let's go over it again.

1319
01:34:38,006 --> 01:34:40,174
When the dawn alights
the Dagger's Tip,

1320
01:34:40,258 --> 01:34:42,551
-the Three Kings...
-Will reveal the doorway.

1321
01:34:42,635 --> 01:34:44,428
That's what he said.
You know what it means?

1322
01:34:44,512 --> 01:34:46,055
-No, what does it mean?
-l have no idea.

1323
01:34:46,139 --> 01:34:47,931
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Checkpoint. Checkpoint.

1324
01:34:48,016 --> 01:34:49,433
l don't have my passport.

1325
01:34:51,811 --> 01:34:53,187
Passport!

1326
01:35:00,111 --> 01:35:02,112
They got cameras at the top.

1327
01:35:06,076 --> 01:35:09,536
All right, chill. This is espionage time.
l can handle it.

1328
01:35:09,621 --> 01:35:12,664
These are my people.
l'm one-thirty-sixth Arab.

1329
01:35:15,585 --> 01:35:17,086
Great, a fricking Munchkin.

1330
01:35:17,170 --> 01:35:19,630
Little people are mean.
Tell him he's tall.

1331
01:35:28,473 --> 01:35:31,308
The Dagger's Tip? Right?

1332
01:35:31,393 --> 01:35:33,894
Egypt, Jordan. We want to go there.

1333
01:35:33,978 --> 01:35:37,231
Me and my family. This is my family.
This is my son,

1334
01:35:37,315 --> 01:35:40,943
my other son, my daughter.
We're tourists, from New York.

1335
01:35:41,027 --> 01:35:42,903
-New York?
-Yes. Yes.

1336
01:35:42,987 --> 01:35:44,029
Fifty kilometers.

1337
01:35:44,114 --> 01:35:46,448
You look like the guy that runs
my falafel stand. Thank you very much.

1338
01:35:46,908 --> 01:35:48,700
-l know. l know you from somewhere.
-Go, Yankees!

1339
01:35:49,369 --> 01:35:50,536
Put it on the wire to the ClA.

1340
01:35:54,916 --> 01:35:59,670
Decepticons, boy's location detected.

1341
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:11,598
Undercover, yo. You got to blend in
with your surroundings.

1342
01:36:11,683 --> 01:36:14,017
You know, you got to be part
of the landscape.

1343
01:36:22,110 --> 01:36:25,195
Awesome! l think aliens built that.

1344
01:36:25,572 --> 01:36:26,572
Yeah, yeah.

1345
01:36:27,323 --> 01:36:29,366
Come on. Move it! Move it!

1346
01:36:29,492 --> 01:36:31,577
Guard us. Low profile.
Don't make a scene, okay?

1347
01:36:31,661 --> 01:36:34,746
Yeah, some of us got work to do!
Dumb Autobots.

1348
01:36:56,352 --> 01:36:59,438
Being my girlfriend is hazardous
to your health.

1349
01:37:00,231 --> 01:37:04,401
Yeah, well, girls like dangerous boys.

1350
01:37:04,819 --> 01:37:06,403
-Do they?
-Yeah.

1351
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:11,408
You might as well just say it.

1352
01:37:11,493 --> 01:37:12,951
Ladies first.

1353
01:37:14,412 --> 01:37:17,122
Okay, so tonight you're going to be
a gentleman.

1354
01:37:17,207 --> 01:37:20,334
-You're really chivalrous.
-Why are you mad at me?

1355
01:37:20,418 --> 01:37:23,921
You know what?
Baby, l'm not... l'm not mad.

1356
01:37:25,048 --> 01:37:29,510
Do you realize that l just flew 3,000
miles to keep you from getting killed?

1357
01:37:29,594 --> 01:37:30,802
l know.

1358
01:37:34,182 --> 01:37:36,808
Who else could be your girlfriend, Sam?

1359
01:37:36,893 --> 01:37:39,603
Look at the things l go through with you.

1360
01:37:40,230 --> 01:37:42,397
And now we're underneath the moon
and the stars

1361
01:37:42,482 --> 01:37:44,691
and the three most beautiful pyramids
on the planet

1362
01:37:44,776 --> 01:37:47,110
and you still can't even tell me that
you love me.

1363
01:37:48,196 --> 01:37:49,571
Pyramids.

1364
01:37:50,782 --> 01:37:52,199
What? Why do boys always

1365
01:37:52,283 --> 01:37:54,243
-change the subject?
-Pyramids and stars.

1366
01:37:54,327 --> 01:37:55,786
-Sam?
-Come with me really quick.

1367
01:38:03,962 --> 01:38:06,046
Simmons! Leo! Wake up!

1368
01:38:09,342 --> 01:38:11,635
Listen, astronomy class, page 47.
Remember the class?

1369
01:38:11,719 --> 01:38:14,388
No. l was only in college for two days.
Remember that?

1370
01:38:14,472 --> 01:38:16,640
-Here. Get up. Up, up.
-What is he talking about?

1371
01:38:21,896 --> 01:38:23,063
Okay, you see those three stars?

1372
01:38:23,147 --> 01:38:24,898
You see
how the last one touches the horizon?

1373
01:38:25,024 --> 01:38:27,734
That's Orion's belt,
but it's also called the Three Kings.

1374
01:38:27,819 --> 01:38:29,611
And the reason for that
is the three Egyptian kings

1375
01:38:29,696 --> 01:38:32,489
who built the pyramids of Giza
built them to mirror those stars,

1376
01:38:32,574 --> 01:38:34,408
so it's like an arrow staring us
straight in the face.

1377
01:38:34,492 --> 01:38:37,953
They all point due east, towards Jordan.
The mountains of Petra.

1378
01:38:50,967 --> 01:38:52,259
We've had an engine malfunction.

1379
01:38:52,343 --> 01:38:54,303
We're gonna have to divert
to SOCCENT.

1380
01:38:54,387 --> 01:38:56,471
Flight master, let's lighten the load
and prepare for bailout.

1381
01:38:56,556 --> 01:38:59,016
Bailout? Bailout? Bailout? Bailout?

1382
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:02,019
-All right, team, grab your chutes!
-Bailout like bailout?

1383
01:39:04,606 --> 01:39:07,065
-You familiar with the standard MC-4?
-Of course not!

1384
01:39:07,150 --> 01:39:09,443
l've neverjumped out of
a perfectly good airplane before!

1385
01:39:09,527 --> 01:39:10,902
Wait a minute, is this really happening?

1386
01:39:10,987 --> 01:39:12,779
-Yeah.
-All right, here we go.

1387
01:39:13,740 --> 01:39:17,451
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You're behind this, aren't you?

1388
01:39:17,535 --> 01:39:19,161
What are you talking about?
You heard the pilot.

1389
01:39:19,245 --> 01:39:23,123
These guys don't mess around.
This is just standard procedure.

1390
01:39:23,207 --> 01:39:26,376
l'm just following orders to the letter.
lsn't that what you said?

1391
01:39:27,003 --> 01:39:30,088
You just signed a death warrant
on your career, Major.

1392
01:39:34,218 --> 01:39:36,303
What was that? What was that?

1393
01:39:36,387 --> 01:39:38,722
That's not good. Come on.

1394
01:39:39,724 --> 01:39:41,224
-Right this way!
-l can't jump out of an airplane!

1395
01:39:41,309 --> 01:39:43,352
-l have an ulcer! No, no.
-Come on. lt's okay.

1396
01:39:43,728 --> 01:39:45,979
l really can't do this.
What are you doing...

1397
01:39:46,522 --> 01:39:48,565
Come here! Come here.

1398
01:39:48,650 --> 01:39:52,903
-Why aren't you wearing your chute?
-Because l have to secure the VlPs first.

1399
01:39:52,987 --> 01:39:57,199
Okay, l want you to listen very carefully
and memorize everything that l say.

1400
01:39:57,283 --> 01:40:00,243
Each chute has a GPS tracker so you
can be found by Search and Rescue.

1401
01:40:00,328 --> 01:40:02,454
Right next to that's a fabric webbing
called a bridle,

1402
01:40:02,538 --> 01:40:04,665
which holds the pin
that keeps the main container closed.

1403
01:40:04,749 --> 01:40:06,833
-Okay, are you listening?
-l can't hear what...

1404
01:40:06,918 --> 01:40:08,335
-Stop that!
-All right. All right.

1405
01:40:08,419 --> 01:40:10,879
All right,
when the pilot chute inflates into the air,

1406
01:40:10,963 --> 01:40:13,131
it pulls the pin and opens the main.

1407
01:40:13,216 --> 01:40:15,258
Red's your backup, blue's your primary.

1408
01:40:15,343 --> 01:40:19,513
l want you to pull the blue.
l need you to pull it really hard!

1409
01:40:19,597 --> 01:40:22,432
Not now, we're on the plane,
you dumb-ass!

1410
01:40:25,311 --> 01:40:28,313
-He say good-bye?
-No, he didn't even say good-bye.

1411
01:40:28,773 --> 01:40:30,565
General, we're loaded and ready.

1412
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:33,527
You give us the go, and we'll be ready
to press in five minutes.

1413
01:40:33,611 --> 01:40:36,154
-Excellent.
-Sir, you need to see this now.

1414
01:40:39,117 --> 01:40:41,159
-Have we checked these coordinates?
-Egypt, sir.

1415
01:40:41,244 --> 01:40:44,037
-They're airdropping in.
-You've got to be kidding me.

1416
01:40:44,122 --> 01:40:45,497
He knows something.

1417
01:40:45,581 --> 01:40:47,958
We need to be ready to back him up
if this thing goes hot.

1418
01:40:49,252 --> 01:40:50,377
Copy that.

1419
01:40:50,461 --> 01:40:52,921
ClA just got a hit on the boy,

1420
01:40:53,464 --> 01:40:55,549
1 00 miles from the location
on that little note there.

1421
01:40:55,633 --> 01:40:56,717
lt's getting hotter.

1422
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:03,807
lt's gotta be around here somewhere.

1423
01:41:25,037 --> 01:41:27,038
You see the size of this?

1424
01:41:27,749 --> 01:41:30,167
-You see this?
-Spectacular.

1425
01:41:31,836 --> 01:41:34,296
Amazing. Look at that.

1426
01:41:44,515 --> 01:41:46,850
-lt's here somewhere, guys.
-Yeah, why?

1427
01:41:46,934 --> 01:41:48,477
'Cause we're trusting Grandpa Blackbird

1428
01:41:48,561 --> 01:41:50,061
who doesn't even know
what planet he's on?

1429
01:41:50,146 --> 01:41:54,149
ln his defense, this is the biggest
doorway l've ever seen in my entire life.

1430
01:41:54,901 --> 01:41:58,445
Okay. Well, that's great.
Let me do a quick search, all right?

1431
01:41:58,529 --> 01:42:00,113
Nope. Ever cross your mind, guys,

1432
01:42:00,198 --> 01:42:01,615
that archeologists
have been here before?

1433
01:42:01,699 --> 01:42:02,783
There's nothing here.

1434
01:42:02,867 --> 01:42:05,243
Real life is heartbreak, despair, kid.

1435
01:42:05,328 --> 01:42:07,454
Sometimes you get to
the end of the rainbow

1436
01:42:07,538 --> 01:42:09,706
and the leprechauns went
and booby-trapped it!

1437
01:42:09,791 --> 01:42:12,167
l'm listening to you?
You live with your mother!

1438
01:42:13,336 --> 01:42:15,462
-lt's not over.
-lt is over. lt's done.

1439
01:42:15,546 --> 01:42:17,047
Why are we still listening to you,
little punk-ass?

1440
01:42:17,131 --> 01:42:19,174
l mean, what you ever done for us
except ding my rim?

1441
01:42:19,258 --> 01:42:21,218
Killed Megatron. How about that?

1442
01:42:21,302 --> 01:42:22,344
Well, he didn't get the job done,

1443
01:42:22,428 --> 01:42:23,970
you know what l mean,
'cause he's back now...

1444
01:42:24,055 --> 01:42:26,973
-Are you scared?
-Scared? Scared of your ugly face!

1445
01:42:27,058 --> 01:42:29,476
l'm ugly?
Well, we're twins, you stupid genius!

1446
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:31,311
Bring it, then! Get off me!

1447
01:42:31,395 --> 01:42:34,481
-l'll change your face around!
-l'll get all up in that ass!

1448
01:42:34,565 --> 01:42:35,982
Bring it!

1449
01:42:36,734 --> 01:42:37,901
Guys!

1450
01:42:39,237 --> 01:42:40,821
-You like the way that feels?
-That didn't hurt.

1451
01:42:40,905 --> 01:42:42,447
You like that, don't you?

1452
01:42:42,532 --> 01:42:44,908
-Come on, Bumblebee!
-Bumblebee, listen.

1453
01:42:51,582 --> 01:42:52,582
Now, that's rude.

1454
01:43:04,554 --> 01:43:06,513
Oh, my God. The symbols.

1455
01:43:07,765 --> 01:43:09,599
Bee! Shoot it.

1456
01:43:35,459 --> 01:43:38,128
-Check this out.
-Look at it.

1457
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:40,380
Wow!

1458
01:43:40,464 --> 01:43:42,966
These are the bodies
Jetfire was talking about.

1459
01:43:43,509 --> 01:43:45,427
The tomb of the Primes.

1460
01:43:45,887 --> 01:43:49,639
Yo!

1461
01:44:03,654 --> 01:44:04,988
The Matrix.

1462
01:44:22,548 --> 01:44:26,134
No.

1463
01:44:28,512 --> 01:44:31,056
Thousands of years, turned to dust.

1464
01:44:31,682 --> 01:44:33,642
This isn't how it's supposed to end.

1465
01:44:33,726 --> 01:44:34,893
Hear that?

1466
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:41,816
US Air Force! C-1 7s!

1467
01:44:41,901 --> 01:44:44,611
-What's a C-1 7?
-You can't bring him back, Sam.

1468
01:44:44,695 --> 01:44:48,281
-There's nothing left.
-Look! Look around you.

1469
01:44:48,366 --> 01:44:50,951
We didn't just go through everything
we went through for no reason at all,

1470
01:44:51,035 --> 01:44:52,452
to just have it end like this.

1471
01:44:52,536 --> 01:44:54,204
There is a reason that we are here.

1472
01:44:54,288 --> 01:44:58,166
The voices and the symbols in my head
led us here for a purpose.

1473
01:45:04,048 --> 01:45:06,341
Everyone's after me
because of what l know,

1474
01:45:08,636 --> 01:45:11,846
and what l know is that
this is going to work.

1475
01:45:12,306 --> 01:45:15,350
-How do you know it's gonna work?
-Because l believe it.

1476
01:45:25,403 --> 01:45:27,737
You best let me out of this plane.

1477
01:45:39,834 --> 01:45:41,376
Dropping the big boy. Sam!

1478
01:45:48,509 --> 01:45:50,760
You think you can bring him back to life
with that pixie dust?

1479
01:45:50,845 --> 01:45:52,429
Absolutely. Let's go.

1480
01:46:02,523 --> 01:46:03,732
Go!

1481
01:46:04,567 --> 01:46:07,277
Let's move it.
Remember, they're friendlies.

1482
01:46:17,913 --> 01:46:19,456
Cover Optimus!

1483
01:46:22,418 --> 01:46:24,502
Secure the village.
Get those cases down here.

1484
01:46:24,587 --> 01:46:26,713
l need snipers and Stingers up high.

1485
01:46:26,797 --> 01:46:30,925
So, we just dropped off 1 0 tons of
dead robot in the middle of nowhere.

1486
01:46:31,010 --> 01:46:32,635
l hope this little kid know
what he's doing.

1487
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:33,762
Yeah, me too.

1488
01:46:39,727 --> 01:46:42,937
Got a visual! Yellow team! Four clicks!

1489
01:46:46,233 --> 01:46:47,567
Pop flare!

1490
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:52,447
-That's them, right there. See the flare?
-Right over there! See it?

1491
01:47:03,501 --> 01:47:04,667
Sam!

1492
01:47:17,014 --> 01:47:18,556
Oh, God. Please, God! Please.

1493
01:47:18,641 --> 01:47:20,266
Leo, stop freaking out. Stop freaking out.

1494
01:47:20,351 --> 01:47:21,768
Shut this guy up, huh?

1495
01:47:21,852 --> 01:47:24,270
-Please, just let me live, just let me live!
-Shut up and let him drive!

1496
01:47:24,355 --> 01:47:25,647
-Just stop screaming...
-All right, that's it!

1497
01:47:28,359 --> 01:47:29,818
l can't take that guy anymore.

1498
01:47:43,082 --> 01:47:45,166
Hide in the dust! Use the dust!

1499
01:47:52,758 --> 01:47:54,717
We've got to split up.
Bumblebee, you're the decoy.

1500
01:47:54,802 --> 01:47:57,470
You lead the Decepticons away,
all right? l'm gonna get Optimus.

1501
01:47:57,555 --> 01:48:00,098
l'll help draw their fire
with Huey and Dewey there.

1502
01:48:00,182 --> 01:48:02,225
You get to those soldiers.

1503
01:48:03,352 --> 01:48:06,396
-l hope that dust works, kid.
-Thank you.

1504
01:48:10,192 --> 01:48:13,653
He's turning around. He's coming back.
He's coming back.

1505
01:48:14,405 --> 01:48:15,446
lt's up to me.

1506
01:48:15,739 --> 01:48:18,408
One man, alone,
betrayed by the country he loves,

1507
01:48:18,492 --> 01:48:20,994
now its last hope
in their final hour of need.

1508
01:48:21,078 --> 01:48:24,747
Prepare to be driven like never before,
by the maestro.

1509
01:48:24,832 --> 01:48:27,834
-Hey, hey! Don't go nowhere! Drive.
-You'll never make it, kid.

1510
01:48:27,918 --> 01:48:30,378
-l'm coming with you.
-Bravery will only get you so far.

1511
01:48:30,462 --> 01:48:33,381
You tased me, okay? You owe me!
l'm going.

1512
01:48:33,465 --> 01:48:35,258
Okay, okay. That was a test.
You passed. All right?

1513
01:48:43,559 --> 01:48:46,978
That thing's got alien tattoos all over it.
That ain't Air Force.

1514
01:48:51,066 --> 01:48:53,234
-What the hell was that?
-Anyone copy?

1515
01:48:53,319 --> 01:48:55,361
-Anyone there? Who's up?
-Copy?

1516
01:48:55,446 --> 01:48:57,739
-Radio's down.
-lt's dead. Comms are down.

1517
01:48:57,823 --> 01:48:59,157
EMP burst.

1518
01:48:59,533 --> 01:49:02,410
l see how this day is going
in this godforsaken desert.

1519
01:49:04,163 --> 01:49:05,205
Yes, sir?

1520
01:49:05,289 --> 01:49:08,124
-Major Lennox told me to pull the cord.
-l know, sir.

1521
01:49:08,209 --> 01:49:11,044
Well, what country am l in right now?

1522
01:49:11,128 --> 01:49:12,378
United States.

1523
01:49:12,463 --> 01:49:16,382
No, not the United States.
l'm from the United States.

1524
01:49:16,467 --> 01:49:19,135
I'm in the middle of nowhere
surrounded by donkeys.

1525
01:49:19,220 --> 01:49:24,057
Well, that was our good friend,
Galloway. He's less than pleased.

1526
01:49:24,141 --> 01:49:26,809
How is it that we can't reach our men,

1527
01:49:26,894 --> 01:49:32,273
but he can reach me
from some random Egyptian desert?

1528
01:49:36,278 --> 01:49:37,528
Nothing.

1529
01:49:38,113 --> 01:49:40,990
Right, go burn an SOS. Let the eye in
the sky know we need some help.

1530
01:49:41,075 --> 01:49:43,076
-Yes, sir.
-Okay, boys, old school time!

1531
01:49:43,619 --> 01:49:45,995
Pop some more flares
so the kid can find us.

1532
01:49:51,585 --> 01:49:55,046
Look. There it is.
We got a couple of miles.

1533
01:49:55,714 --> 01:50:00,551
Lennox's team has the latest
in quantum crypto gear.

1534
01:50:00,636 --> 01:50:06,015
Can somebody tell me why we can't
establish simple radio contact?

1535
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:08,768
We're hailing them on every frequency
and mode in the book, sir.

1536
01:50:08,852 --> 01:50:11,229
Our satellites in the area have
gone blind. We're working it, sir.

1537
01:50:11,313 --> 01:50:14,941
Damn it. Something's not right.
lt doesn't add up.

1538
01:50:15,025 --> 01:50:18,444
Contact the Jordanians, see
what air assets they've got in the area,

1539
01:50:18,529 --> 01:50:20,905
and get Egypt's General Salam.

1540
01:50:20,990 --> 01:50:24,867
Ask him to clear some USV overflights
in Egyptian airspace.

1541
01:50:24,952 --> 01:50:28,037
We need an assist
in confirming visuals now.

1542
01:50:28,289 --> 01:50:29,872
Scramble Predators now.

1543
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:31,457
V-1 , rotate.

1544
01:50:43,512 --> 01:50:45,346
We still have a mile that way.

1545
01:50:51,020 --> 01:50:52,395
Come on.

1546
01:50:55,482 --> 01:50:57,066
This way. This way.

1547
01:51:01,697 --> 01:51:05,033
-One man, alone...
-Stop saying that!

1548
01:51:05,117 --> 01:51:06,367
...betrayed by the country he loves!

1549
01:51:06,452 --> 01:51:08,661
Oh, my goodness.
l'm in the car, okay? You're not alone.

1550
01:51:09,330 --> 01:51:11,831
Just relax. You're with the maestro.

1551
01:51:20,507 --> 01:51:22,550
l don't think he's still following us.

1552
01:51:23,552 --> 01:51:25,219
That's what you think.

1553
01:51:42,071 --> 01:51:45,823
Master, sorry to be the bearer
of bad news,

1554
01:51:45,908 --> 01:51:48,951
but the soldiers brought
the body of Prime.

1555
01:51:49,036 --> 01:51:51,245
The boy must have the Matrix.

1556
01:51:51,663 --> 01:51:54,290
We cannot let him reach Optimus.

1557
01:51:54,958 --> 01:51:58,628
Decepticons, begin our assault!

1558
01:51:59,338 --> 01:52:00,963
We've got incoming!

1559
01:52:17,106 --> 01:52:20,024
We got a whole lot of fight
coming our way.

1560
01:52:20,109 --> 01:52:22,110
-How many?
-About 1 3 of them.

1561
01:52:22,194 --> 01:52:24,862
This ain't good. This ain't good.

1562
01:52:33,080 --> 01:52:35,289
We're about to get our asses whupped.

1563
01:52:36,417 --> 01:52:38,209
Bravo-Charlie, kneel!

1564
01:52:38,293 --> 01:52:41,170
All right, those Decepticons
are searching for Sam.

1565
01:52:42,548 --> 01:52:45,466
Whatever he has, he thinks
it'll bring Optimus back to life,

1566
01:52:45,551 --> 01:52:48,428
so our mission is to find him
and get him to Optimus.

1567
01:52:48,512 --> 01:52:51,305
All right, we're gonna draw fire
from the left flank. l need a scout team.

1568
01:52:51,390 --> 01:52:52,432
l'm leading.

1569
01:52:52,516 --> 01:52:54,934
Go up through the middle
with Arcee and lronhide!

1570
01:52:55,018 --> 01:52:56,561
All right, when you see
the precious cargo,

1571
01:52:56,645 --> 01:52:59,397
l want you to pop green smoke and
come back through those pillars.

1572
01:52:59,481 --> 01:53:02,692
We'll have the ambush set. All right.
Let's go. Move out!

1573
01:53:14,788 --> 01:53:17,081
You ever see that film
Gunfight at the O.K. Corral?

1574
01:53:18,542 --> 01:53:21,752
-With Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas?
-No, why?

1575
01:53:25,007 --> 01:53:27,842
-Looks like we're right in the middle of it.
-ls that good?

1576
01:53:30,053 --> 01:53:31,596
A lot of people died.

1577
01:53:50,574 --> 01:53:51,741
Hide!

1578
01:53:53,160 --> 01:53:55,244
-Vamonos, amigos!
-Oh, my God!

1579
01:53:59,666 --> 01:54:01,167
-Hit the deck!
-Oh, my God!

1580
01:54:17,184 --> 01:54:18,267
Sam, Sam.

1581
01:54:19,353 --> 01:54:21,395
l don't think they saw us.

1582
01:54:21,939 --> 01:54:23,773
Get down. Get down. Get down.

1583
01:54:24,149 --> 01:54:25,733
Okay. Listen.

1584
01:54:27,611 --> 01:54:30,947
Once it's clear, we run for Optimus
as fast as we can, okay?

1585
01:54:32,282 --> 01:54:33,783
What if it doesn't work?

1586
01:54:34,618 --> 01:54:36,202
lt's gonna work.

1587
01:54:36,286 --> 01:54:39,288
-What if it doesn't?
-lt's gonna work. lt'll work.

1588
01:56:15,719 --> 01:56:17,178
Up, up, up!

1589
01:56:27,147 --> 01:56:28,814
Get ready to jump!

1590
01:56:47,668 --> 01:56:50,336
We got a half-mile. l don't think
the soldiers know we're here.

1591
01:56:53,048 --> 01:56:54,382
Fall back!

1592
01:56:54,466 --> 01:56:57,927
-lronhide, up the middle!
-lronhide, move it!

1593
01:56:58,011 --> 01:57:00,012
Let's go! Go, go!

1594
01:57:07,187 --> 01:57:08,562
Devastator!

1595
01:57:12,025 --> 01:57:13,943
We're trapped! There's nowhere to go.
We're gonna die.

1596
01:57:14,111 --> 01:57:16,737
lf we're going out, we're going out
like men, understand?

1597
01:57:48,895 --> 01:57:50,730
Look at this mother...

1598
01:57:50,814 --> 01:57:52,481
Mean robots suck!

1599
01:58:04,453 --> 01:58:07,037
Hang on! Hang on, okay?

1600
01:58:11,668 --> 01:58:13,461
-Simmons!
-Don't let go!

1601
01:58:13,545 --> 01:58:16,005
Hang in there, l got you! Just hang in.

1602
01:58:20,135 --> 01:58:21,635
l don't want to die!

1603
01:58:23,305 --> 01:58:25,181
Kung fu grip, boy. Kung fu grip!

1604
01:58:25,265 --> 01:58:26,515
You ain't getting me!

1605
01:58:31,563 --> 01:58:33,856
He dead. He got so ate.

1606
01:58:34,191 --> 01:58:37,109
-Who's your daddy now, huh?
-He got all ate up.

1607
01:58:37,194 --> 01:58:39,320
The only safe place is right under it.

1608
01:58:39,404 --> 01:58:43,073
-Run at it. Run for its feet! Move it!
-Yeah.

1609
01:58:49,956 --> 01:58:53,292
You should've never eaten me!
l'm gonna bust your face up!

1610
01:58:58,298 --> 01:58:59,465
Oh, my God!

1611
01:59:02,219 --> 01:59:04,720
Nobody mess with me! ln your face!

1612
01:59:05,639 --> 01:59:07,306
Keep fighting, Mudflap!

1613
01:59:07,390 --> 01:59:08,474
Oh, my God!

1614
01:59:16,233 --> 01:59:18,192
Nobody messes with the twins.

1615
01:59:22,072 --> 01:59:24,240
l got you... My bad!

1616
01:59:26,993 --> 01:59:29,078
Man! You shot me in the face!

1617
01:59:29,496 --> 01:59:31,789
-Stay under it!
-Yeah, stay under it!

1618
01:59:35,752 --> 01:59:37,086
Come on.

1619
01:59:53,270 --> 01:59:54,478
Judy!

1620
01:59:59,568 --> 02:00:01,652
-Sam! Sam!
-What?

1621
02:00:02,654 --> 02:00:04,613
Sam! Sam!

1622
02:00:09,077 --> 02:00:10,327
Sam!

1623
02:00:10,412 --> 02:00:11,745
-Sam!
-Dad!

1624
02:00:19,462 --> 02:00:20,880
Wait, wait!

1625
02:00:22,132 --> 02:00:25,634
Please listen to me!
l want you to run! Run!

1626
02:00:25,719 --> 02:00:28,429
Dad, just stop!
They don't want you, they want me!

1627
02:00:28,513 --> 02:00:29,972
-Oh, God!
-Wait!

1628
02:00:30,056 --> 02:00:31,932
Sam Witwicky.

1629
02:00:32,017 --> 02:00:36,312
Don't hurt them. This is what you want.
You don't want them.

1630
02:00:36,396 --> 02:00:38,063
-Go! Go!
-Please, stop!

1631
02:00:38,148 --> 02:00:39,315
-Stop!
-Listen to your father!

1632
02:00:39,399 --> 02:00:41,191
Just get out of here!

1633
02:00:41,526 --> 02:00:43,903
Just don't hurt them.
l know what you want.

1634
02:00:43,987 --> 02:00:45,487
Just go! Just go!

1635
02:00:45,572 --> 02:00:49,366
And l know that you need me
because l know about the Matrix.

1636
02:00:49,993 --> 02:00:51,535
-Don't do it, Sam...
-Please, Dad.

1637
02:00:51,620 --> 02:00:55,581
-They're going to kill us all anyway!
-Here's what you want, right here.

1638
02:00:55,957 --> 02:00:57,374
Bumblebee!

1639
02:01:10,597 --> 02:01:12,222
Kill him, Bee. Kill him.

1640
02:01:50,178 --> 02:01:52,721
-Stay tight, Ma.
-Come on. Get in here.

1641
02:02:06,653 --> 02:02:08,404
-Bee?
-Yeah.

1642
02:02:11,950 --> 02:02:13,033
-Hey!
-l don't know

1643
02:02:13,118 --> 02:02:15,077
what's going on, but we've got to move!

1644
02:02:19,249 --> 02:02:21,083
There's got to be a way out of here!

1645
02:02:22,419 --> 02:02:24,503
Judy, get back, get back, get back.

1646
02:02:25,714 --> 02:02:28,716
Against the wall! Against the wall!
Against the wall. Against the wall.

1647
02:02:30,093 --> 02:02:32,094
Bee! Bumblebee!

1648
02:02:32,929 --> 02:02:34,930
You get them somewhere safe,
all right?

1649
02:02:37,267 --> 02:02:38,434
You've got to get in the car
and get to safety.

1650
02:02:38,518 --> 02:02:40,352
No, this isn't up for discussion!

1651
02:02:40,437 --> 02:02:42,354
-You're my son! You're my son!
-l know.

1652
02:02:42,439 --> 02:02:43,689
-Dad...
-We all go together!

1653
02:02:43,773 --> 02:02:45,065
-Listen...
-We're all going together!

1654
02:02:45,150 --> 02:02:48,444
Dad, stop, okay? Get in the car.
He's gonna get you to safety.

1655
02:02:48,528 --> 02:02:50,779
You know, you run.
You don't stop, you don't hide, you run.

1656
02:02:50,864 --> 02:02:53,449
You hear what l'm saying, okay?
l'll find you when you're safe.

1657
02:02:53,533 --> 02:02:55,034
-No.
-You've got to let me go, Dad.

1658
02:02:55,118 --> 02:02:58,454
-You have to let me go. You have to.
-Ron.

1659
02:03:01,124 --> 02:03:03,584
Ron. Ron, let him go.

1660
02:03:05,628 --> 02:03:07,963
You come back! Come on.

1661
02:03:08,089 --> 02:03:09,840
Ron! Mikaela! Mikaela!

1662
02:03:09,924 --> 02:03:12,468
-Go with my parents.
-l'm not gonna go without you.

1663
02:03:23,772 --> 02:03:25,314
Move to cover!

1664
02:03:29,569 --> 02:03:31,320
We got Jordanians!

1665
02:03:31,404 --> 02:03:32,863
We got help!

1666
02:03:38,995 --> 02:03:40,245
Down!

1667
02:03:56,805 --> 02:03:58,430
You okay, soldier?

1668
02:03:58,515 --> 02:04:01,683
We're gonna help you, soldier. Let's
get these wounded clear of the bird.

1669
02:04:01,768 --> 02:04:03,685
Stay still. Stay still. Don't move.

1670
02:04:03,770 --> 02:04:06,063
You all right, young man?
You have a radio?

1671
02:04:07,524 --> 02:04:11,985
Hey, kid, it's been nice knowing you.
Remember what l did for my country.

1672
02:04:13,488 --> 02:04:15,155
This is my moment.

1673
02:04:15,907 --> 02:04:16,990
You're crazy!

1674
02:04:19,077 --> 02:04:20,953
ETA to station, two minutes.

1675
02:04:21,037 --> 02:04:22,913
-Put it on the main screen.
-Sir. Yes, sir.

1676
02:04:22,997 --> 02:04:24,373
Predator 01 .

1677
02:04:34,884 --> 02:04:36,093
Shit, it's a trick.

1678
02:04:36,177 --> 02:04:38,595
Commence Operation Firestorm.
Send everyone.

1679
02:04:38,680 --> 02:04:41,265
-Get those Marines on the ground.
-Roll in strike packages...

1680
02:04:41,599 --> 02:04:43,225
Task Force Ripper, execute Lightning.

1681
02:05:03,746 --> 02:05:06,290
-Spotted Sam!
-Sam!

1682
02:05:06,749 --> 02:05:08,041
lronhide!

1683
02:05:08,918 --> 02:05:11,086
Follow us to the pillars.
We'll take you to Optimus.

1684
02:05:13,923 --> 02:05:16,592
Get out, Sam! Get to the pillars!

1685
02:05:17,844 --> 02:05:18,927
Let's go.

1686
02:05:22,640 --> 02:05:26,143
Oh, God. This is it. The pyramid's built
right over the machine.

1687
02:05:26,227 --> 02:05:30,606
lf they turn that machine on,
no more sun.

1688
02:05:33,067 --> 02:05:37,487
Not on my watch.

1689
02:05:48,458 --> 02:05:50,000
USS Stennis. ldentify.

1690
02:05:50,084 --> 02:05:52,502
Where the hell are you?
Watching the Weather Channel?

1691
02:05:52,587 --> 02:05:54,463
SportsCenter?
l Dream of Jeannie orsomething?

1692
02:05:54,547 --> 02:05:58,550
We got 300 satellites up there.
Where the hell are all our men?

1693
02:05:58,635 --> 02:06:00,135
ldentify yourself.

1694
02:06:00,637 --> 02:06:01,887
What is your name, sailor?

1695
02:06:02,472 --> 02:06:07,434
Wilder, Captain of the
USS John C. Stennis aircraft carrier.

1696
02:06:08,770 --> 02:06:10,395
Okay, Captain Wilder.

1697
02:06:10,480 --> 02:06:12,814
This is Agent Seymour Simmons
of Sector Seven.

1698
02:06:12,899 --> 02:06:15,275
There is the mother
of all non-biologicals

1699
02:06:15,360 --> 02:06:17,152
getting ready to blow up our sun.

1700
02:06:17,237 --> 02:06:19,071
Do you want to have a throwdown
about my lack of clearance

1701
02:06:19,155 --> 02:06:21,156
or do you want to help save
a gazillion lives?

1702
02:06:22,158 --> 02:06:24,493
All right, Agent Simmons. l'm listening.

1703
02:06:31,668 --> 02:06:34,378
Five clicks west of the Gulf,

1704
02:06:34,462 --> 02:06:37,422
we got ourselves an alien
remodeling a pyramid.

1705
02:06:37,507 --> 02:06:40,550
Our one hope is a prototype weapon
called a rail gun,

1706
02:06:40,635 --> 02:06:43,679
-shoots a steel projectile at Mach 7.
-That's classified.

1707
02:06:43,763 --> 02:06:47,349
Don't talk to me about classified,
all right?

1708
02:06:47,433 --> 02:06:50,102
Now, if you've got a battleship
in the Gulf, which l know you do,

1709
02:06:50,186 --> 02:06:52,729
you tell them to ready that weapon!

1710
02:06:54,107 --> 02:06:56,316
Contact destroyer USS KIDD.

1711
02:06:57,193 --> 02:06:58,860
Alpha Team, flank left!

1712
02:06:58,945 --> 02:07:00,696
This way! Move it!

1713
02:07:02,657 --> 02:07:04,908
-Where do you need us, sir?
-Protect those in the line of fire.

1714
02:07:04,993 --> 02:07:06,618
Let's go! Go!

1715
02:07:10,540 --> 02:07:13,041
Give me your Comms. Come on. Epps!

1716
02:07:17,422 --> 02:07:19,798
Right now, we need air support, ASAP!

1717
02:07:19,882 --> 02:07:22,467
Have troops in contact 20 miles
northwest. Radar contact.

1718
02:07:22,552 --> 02:07:23,677
Proceed to 88 Alpha Sierra...

1719
02:07:27,765 --> 02:07:29,349
B-1 , snap 090.

1720
02:07:29,434 --> 02:07:31,852
You are approved to drop your
2,000-pound JDAMs.

1721
02:07:39,068 --> 02:07:40,402
-What you got?
-l couldn't get to them, sir.

1722
02:07:40,486 --> 02:07:42,529
They're 600 meters away
and they're heading right for the pillars.

1723
02:07:42,613 --> 02:07:45,490
All right. Precious cargo's coming!

1724
02:07:45,825 --> 02:07:46,825
Move!

1725
02:07:57,670 --> 02:07:59,212
Curse you!

1726
02:08:13,186 --> 02:08:15,270
Sam! Spotted Sam!

1727
02:08:47,553 --> 02:08:49,304
-Come on!
-2-2 covering fire.

1728
02:08:49,389 --> 02:08:50,806
Two civilians, 1 2 o'clock!

1729
02:08:59,357 --> 02:09:00,941
Cover for us!

1730
02:09:07,323 --> 02:09:10,117
Hold the air strike!
We're rescuing civilians!

1731
02:09:22,422 --> 02:09:24,005
Keep firing!

1732
02:09:30,012 --> 02:09:31,680
Come on! Mikaela!

1733
02:09:32,098 --> 02:09:34,433
Come on! Get in here!

1734
02:09:35,351 --> 02:09:36,810
Look who showed up.

1735
02:09:36,894 --> 02:09:38,895
You better have a good reason for us
to be here.

1736
02:09:38,980 --> 02:09:40,689
-Where's Optimus?
-He's right over there,

1737
02:09:40,773 --> 02:09:42,190
across the courtyard.

1738
02:09:42,900 --> 02:09:45,235
-l got to get to him right now.
-Not with an air strike coming.

1739
02:09:45,319 --> 02:09:47,529
l have to get to him right now.

1740
02:09:49,073 --> 02:09:50,407
Go. Back, back, back, back.

1741
02:09:50,491 --> 02:09:52,200
-Go.
-Listen up...

1742
02:09:55,663 --> 02:09:56,872
Okay.

1743
02:10:00,501 --> 02:10:01,877
lncoming!

1744
02:10:02,879 --> 02:10:05,088
Stick the landing.

1745
02:10:06,007 --> 02:10:08,884
Behold the glory of Jetfire!

1746
02:10:10,178 --> 02:10:13,722
Now let me show you how we brought
the pain in my day!

1747
02:10:33,784 --> 02:10:35,076
l'm too old for this crap.

1748
02:10:35,244 --> 02:10:37,913
Keep going, man, 1 5 rounds of fighting.

1749
02:10:58,059 --> 02:11:01,561
l am directly below
the enemy's scrotum.

1750
02:11:02,313 --> 02:11:05,607
25.7 meters above sea IeveI,
29.32 north.

1751
02:11:05,691 --> 02:11:07,901
-Kill track, 5205...
-Target acquired.

1752
02:11:07,985 --> 02:11:10,570
-Killing track.
-Two, one...

1753
02:11:10,655 --> 02:11:11,947
Fire!

1754
02:11:26,128 --> 02:11:27,796
Yeah! Yeah!

1755
02:11:28,172 --> 02:11:31,841
B-1's time on target, 30 seconds.
2,000-pound JDAMs inbound.

1756
02:11:31,926 --> 02:11:34,052
We're gonna make a break through
the B's on my command, okay?

1757
02:11:34,136 --> 02:11:37,055
You guys stick with me, you
understand? You stay on my ass.

1758
02:11:37,265 --> 02:11:40,517
-1-1 tally orange smoke.
-l hope these F-1 6s got good aim.

1759
02:11:40,601 --> 02:11:44,145
-Yeah? Why is that?
-l told them to hit the orange smoke.

1760
02:11:45,731 --> 02:11:47,190
You mean that orange smoke?

1761
02:11:47,275 --> 02:11:48,858
lt wasn't my best toss, okay?

1762
02:11:48,943 --> 02:11:51,695
-Viper, thunder.
-Run!

1763
02:12:00,705 --> 02:12:01,997
lncoming!

1764
02:12:05,084 --> 02:12:06,334
Come on!

1765
02:12:26,606 --> 02:12:27,772

Sam!

1769
02:13:05,394 --> 02:13:06,895
Hold your fire!

1770
02:13:09,315 --> 02:13:10,482
Sam!

1771
02:13:12,109 --> 02:13:14,361
Stay back! Mikaela, stay back!

1772
02:13:16,405 --> 02:13:18,448
Fucking do something!

1773
02:13:53,859 --> 02:14:00,115
-Sam! Sam!
-Sam! Sam! Sam! Sammy! Sam!

1774
02:14:01,909 --> 02:14:03,702
-Let me go!
-Come on, you got to move.

1775
02:14:03,786 --> 02:14:06,538
-You got to move, come on.
-We got no pulse.

1776
02:14:06,622 --> 02:14:07,747
Starting CPR.

1777
02:14:07,832 --> 02:14:11,042
-l have to see my kid! l got a son...
-Sammy!

1778
02:14:11,794 --> 02:14:12,919
Sam!

1779
02:14:15,256 --> 02:14:16,798
-Clear.
-Ready to shock.

1780
02:14:16,882 --> 02:14:19,634
-Clear!
-Ready to shock. One, two, three.

1781
02:14:22,596 --> 02:14:24,013
Do it again!

1782
02:14:29,520 --> 02:14:30,854
No!

1783
02:14:32,898 --> 02:14:37,986
Okay, listen to my voice.
l love you and l need you.

1784
02:14:39,238 --> 02:14:42,782
Please. Please, come back to me.
Sam, please!

1785
02:14:42,867 --> 02:14:44,451
l love you.

1786
02:14:53,836 --> 02:14:58,173
Where am l? Where am l?
Am l dead? Am l dead?

1787
02:14:58,674 --> 02:15:02,969
We have been watching you
a long, long time.

1788
02:15:05,347 --> 02:15:09,350
You have fought for Optimus,
our last descendant,

1789
02:15:09,435 --> 02:15:14,522
with courage and with sacrifice,
the virtues of a leader,

1790
02:15:15,441 --> 02:15:18,026
a leader worthy of our secret.

1791
02:15:18,569 --> 02:15:23,198
The Matrix of Leadership is not found,
it is earned.

1792
02:15:24,450 --> 02:15:26,659
Return now to Optimus.

1793
02:15:27,369 --> 02:15:29,704
Merge the Matrix with his spark.

1794
02:15:30,247 --> 02:15:34,834
lt is, and always has been, your destiny.

1795
02:15:39,757 --> 02:15:40,882
Sam!

1796
02:15:47,389 --> 02:15:49,808
l love you. l love you.

1797
02:16:27,263 --> 02:16:30,598
Boy, you returned for me.

1798
02:16:31,934 --> 02:16:33,893
A living Prime.

1799
02:16:35,479 --> 02:16:37,689
l don't believe it!

1800
02:16:47,741 --> 02:16:50,159
My Matrix!

1801
02:16:55,499 --> 02:16:57,417
Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up!

1802
02:16:58,294 --> 02:16:59,836
Get up, Prime!

1803
02:17:01,755 --> 02:17:03,131
Oh, no.

1804
02:17:03,465 --> 02:17:07,468
He's turning on the machine!
You got to stop him! Get up!

1805
02:17:07,970 --> 02:17:09,304
Optimus!

1806
02:17:11,515 --> 02:17:13,892
Fallen, my master.

1807
02:17:13,976 --> 02:17:18,438
My brothers could not stop me from this.

1808
02:17:19,315 --> 02:17:23,693
Yes, now l claim your sun.

1809
02:17:25,988 --> 02:17:29,115
-Move!
-Enemy target, top of pyramid. Engage!

1810
02:17:29,199 --> 02:17:30,742
Engage! Engage!

1811
02:17:36,206 --> 02:17:39,167
ln moments, we'll be at firing strength.

1812
02:17:54,767 --> 02:17:59,312
All my Decepticon life, l never did
a thing worth doing until now.

1813
02:17:59,855 --> 02:18:02,774
Optimus, take my parts

1814
02:18:02,858 --> 02:18:06,027
and you will have a power
you've never known.

1815
02:18:06,987 --> 02:18:09,030
Fulfill your destiny.

1816
02:18:15,329 --> 02:18:17,163
Jolt! Electrify!

1817
02:18:17,623 --> 02:18:19,540
Transplant those afterburners.

1818
02:18:37,893 --> 02:18:39,519
Let's roll.

1819
02:18:41,981 --> 02:18:44,065
Fire mission on the pyramids.

1820
02:18:55,911 --> 02:18:59,372
This planet will be dark forever.

1821
02:19:21,603 --> 02:19:24,022
Die, like your brothers!

1822
02:19:24,648 --> 02:19:26,899
They were your brothers, too.

1823
02:19:55,763 --> 02:19:57,638
Starscream!

1824
02:20:10,652 --> 02:20:12,820
You picked the wrong planet.

1825
02:20:15,783 --> 02:20:17,658
Give me your face.

1826
02:20:26,168 --> 02:20:27,835
l rise.

1827
02:20:28,378 --> 02:20:30,004
You fall.

1828
02:20:32,800 --> 02:20:35,218
No, no.

1829
02:20:37,304 --> 02:20:39,722
Not to call you a coward, Master,

1830
02:20:39,807 --> 02:20:45,478
but sometimes cowards do survive.

1831
02:20:46,063 --> 02:20:48,022
This isn't over.

1832
02:21:15,717 --> 02:21:18,594
lt took all this for you to tell me that
you love me.

1833
02:21:20,222 --> 02:21:21,764
You said it first.

1834
02:22:12,941 --> 02:22:15,568
Thank you, Sam, for saving my life.

1835
02:22:16,862 --> 02:22:18,154
Welcome.

1836
02:22:18,947 --> 02:22:20,656
Thank you for believing in me.

1837
02:22:25,495 --> 02:22:30,041
Our races united by a history
long forgotten

1838
02:22:30,125 --> 02:22:33,544
and a future we shall face together.

1839
02:22:34,087 --> 02:22:36,505
I am Optimus Prime,

1840
02:22:36,590 --> 02:22:41,594
and l send this message so that our
pasts will always be remembered,

1841
02:22:41,678 --> 02:22:45,598
for in those memories, we Iive on.

1842
02:23:08,413 --> 02:23:11,290
So glad you could join us,
Professor Einstein.

1843
02:23:11,792 --> 02:23:13,709
Yeah, l was kind of busy.

1844
02:23:16,380 --> 02:23:17,588
Okay.
