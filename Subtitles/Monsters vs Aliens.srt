00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:27,669
You'd better pray to the Lord
When you see those flying saucers

3
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:31,090
It may be the coming of the Judgment Day

4
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:42,518
Hey, Jerry, you might wanna check this
one out. Palomar just picked it up.

5
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:45,479
Looks like some type of UFO,
and it's heading this way.

6
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,981
How many times do I have to tell you?

7
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,484
UFOs don't exist
and we're never gonna see...

8
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:56,281
- Wow, its energy signature is massive.
- Holy Cheez-Its! What do we do?!

9
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,616
No one told us what to do!

10
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,410
I took this job because
you never have to do anything!

11
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:03,497
Jerry, stop it.
Let me calculate its impact point.

12
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:05,958
Looks like...

13
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,294
...Modesto, California.

14
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:12,714
Supernova, this is Red Dwarf.
We actually have one!

15
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,968
Code Nimoy! I repeat, Code Nimoy!

16
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:11,690
What are you guys doing here?
It's 5:00 in the morning.

17
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,942
Hurry, turn on the TV! Turn it on now!

18
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:17,571
...and some early morning fog,
giving way to sunny skies.

19
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,114
Seventy-five degrees.

20
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,367
A perfect day to stop by
the old folk art and craft show

21
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:27,456
down at the fairgrounds, or a
perfect day to marry Susan Murphy.

22
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,335
I love you, baby.

23
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:32,836
I love you, too.

24
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,925
And good morning, Modesto!

25
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,594
Channel 172.

26
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,814
You look gorgeous, sweetheart.

27
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,733
Thanks, Mom.

28
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,243
My little girl!

29
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,786
Daddy!

30
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:09,539
Now, I want you to know that, even
though I'm about to give you away...

31
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,627
...I will always be here
to take care of you.

32
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:17,673
Don't cry because then you'll make me
cry, and that's just gonna be a mess.

33
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,383
I can't help it!

34
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:25,013
Hello, everyone! Attention, attention!

35
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,474
Wedding starts in 30 minutes!

36
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:30,269
- My beautiful daughter-in-law!
- Hi, Mama Dietl.

37
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:34,690
It's like a fairy tale. The Weatherman
and the Weatherman's Wife.

38
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,608
Romantic.

39
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:41,863
I know. Just think, this time tomorrow,
I'm gonna be in Paris!

40
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,491
And someday, we won't
just be honeymooning there.

41
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:47,786
Derek will become an anchor
or a foreign correspondent.

42
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,707
- And we'll travel all over the world.
- Honey, my fingers are crossed.

43
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,422
One thumb is shorter than the other.
Runs in the family.

44
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,048
Derek doesn't have that.

45
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,968
It skips a generation.
Your kids are gonna have it!

46
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,646
Wow, you look beautiful.

47
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,150
So do you. I mean, handsome.

48
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,611
I mean...
Sorry. I'm just a little frazzled.

49
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,989
I just spent way too much time
with our parents.

50
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:27,743
Don't worry, OK?
We'll be alone soon, just us.

51
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:31,413
Eating cheese and baguettes
by the Seine,

52
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,874
feeding each other chocolate crepes.

53
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:40,380
- Is something wrong?
- No, no! It's just that, well...

54
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,009
There's been a slight change of plans.

55
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,720
We're not going to Paris.

56
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:51,391
- What? Why not?
- Because we're going somewhere better.

57
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,352
- Better than Paris?
- Oh, yeah.

58
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,645
Where? Tahiti?!

59
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,148
Nope! Fresno!

60
00:05:58,232 --> 00:05:59,900
Fresno!

61
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,860
Fresno.

62
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,697
In what universe is Fresno
better than Paris, Derek?

63
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,867
In the "I've got an audition to become

64
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:12,245
Channel 23's new
evening anchor" universe.

65
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,166
Got the call from the general manager,
he wants me to come in immediately!

66
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,628
- Isn't that great?
- Derek!

67
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,880
That's...

68
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:25,217
...amazing! It's amazing.

69
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,594
Fresno's a top 50 market, isn't it?

70
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,971
It's 55th, but we're on our way, babe!

71
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,558
Now, look. About Paris...

72
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:37,896
It's OK. It's fine!
As long as we're together,

73
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,691
Fresno is the most
romantic city in the whole world.

74
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:46,696
- I'm so proud of you.
- Of us! Not just of me.

75
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:51,326
I mean, of course, but we're a team now.
You're so proud of us.

76
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,288
Now, get out of here.
It's bad luck to see me in my dress.

77
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,833
Come on. You know
I don't believe in that stuff.

78
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:02,462
I'll be waiting for you at the altar...
the handsome news anchor in the tux.

79
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,798
Love you! There, I said it.

80
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,676
I love you, too.

81
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,502
Susan!

82
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,881
Where could she be?

83
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:49,176
Susan! Where are you?!

84
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,768
Susan! Where have you been?!

85
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,730
I think I just got hit by a meteorite.

86
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:06,568
Oh, Susan. Every bride feels
that way on her wedding day.

87
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:10,864
My goodness, look at you. You're filthy.
Thank God I have Wet Ones.

88
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:48,944
Wow.

89
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,363
You're glowing.

90
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,449
Thank you.

91
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:58,870
No. No, Susan, you're, like,
really glowing. You're green!

92
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,999
Oh, no!

93
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,293
Derek!

94
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,799
Oh, my gosh!

95
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,217
What's going on?!

96
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,220
- What's happening?!
- You're all shrinking!

97
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,472
Uh-uh! You're growing!

98
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,267
- Well, make it stop!
- Get me the government!

99
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:23,478
This is impossible!

100
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,983
No, this can't be happening.

101
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,570
Wait, wait. Everybody, it's OK!

102
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,738
Have some champagne
while we're figuring this out!

103
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,324
Thumbs! Thumbs!

104
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,079
Derek! Help me!

105
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,584
Sweet Lord!

106
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:55,510
- Here comes the bride!
- Oh, Carl! It's her wedding day!

107
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,681
Derek? Derek?

108
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,309
Beam hurt Derek.

109
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,312
- Susan?
- Thank goodness you're OK!

110
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,897
What's happening to me?

111
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:12,068
Don't panic! Don't worry!
Whatever you do, don't drop...

112
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,572
- Derek!
- Sorry, sir.

113
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,283
Who are you people?
What are you doing?

114
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,703
Stop it! Be careful!

115
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:25,332
Get your hands off me!
Don't you know who I am?!

116
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,126
Please, just leave me alone!

117
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:40,138
Watch those cables!
She's coming down!

118
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:43,558
Watch out!

119
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,439
Move it, move it!
Let's go! Move it, move it!

120
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,483
Pull, pull!

121
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,070
Derek?

122
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,866
All right, let's get
this baby on the bus.

123
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,583
Honey, could you hit the snooze?

124
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,173
Baby, why did you set the alarm?
We're on our honeymoon.

125
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,181
Hello?

126
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,934
What's going on?

127
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,190
Hello?

128
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,252
Is it just legs?
Did they capture a giant pair of legs?

129
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,171
Silence, B.O.B.! She'll hear us!

130
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:40,008
- How? Legs don't have ears.
- Just shush!

131
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,137
Hello?

132
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:48,141
Is there someone there?

133
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,226
Could you tell me where I am?

134
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,453
Hello? What was that?

135
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,004
Hello.

136
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,383
Will you stop...?! Careful!

137
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,303
Please, madam!

138
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,555
Stop! Doing! That!

139
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:34,562
Whatever mad scientist made you,

140
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:37,232
he really went all out.

141
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:41,236
You can talk.

142
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,245
Hi, there!

143
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,997
My back!

144
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,542
Just kidding! I don't have a back!

145
00:13:56,377 --> 00:14:00,171
Forgive him, but as you can see,
he has no brain.

146
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,841
Turns out you don't need one.
Totally overrated!

147
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,009
As a matter of fact, I don't even...

148
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,265
I forgot how to breathe!
Don't know how to breathe!

149
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,767
Help me, Dr. Cockroach! Help!

150
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,144
Suck in, B.O.B.

151
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:20,400
Thanks, Doc. You're a lifesaver.

152
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:23,444
Wow, look at you.
I know what you're thinking.

153
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:27,156
First day in prison, you want to
take down the toughest guy in the yard.

154
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,075
Well, I'd like to see you try.

155
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:34,956
Ninja!

156
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:44,549
- Gosh. Look, she's speechless.
- She?

157
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:49,470
Yes, B.O.B.! We are in the presence
of the rare female monster.

158
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:53,141
No way! It's a boy. Look at his boobies.

159
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,059
We need to have a talk.

160
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:58,855
Gentlemen, I'm afraid we are not making
a very good first impression.

161
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,189
At least I'm talking.

162
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,484
First new monster in years, we
couldn't get a wolf man or a mummy?

163
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,070
Just, you know,
somebody to play cards with.

164
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,867
Might we ask your name, madam?

165
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,077
Susan.

166
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,496
No, no, no. We mean your monster name.

167
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,416
Like, what do people scream
when they see you coming?

168
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,336
You know, like,
"Look out! Here comes...!"

169
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:23,796
Susan.

170
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:25,715
Really?

171
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,550
Susan!

172
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,345
I just scared myself. That is scary.

173
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,221
Yes! Eat times.

174
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,355
That is repulsive!

175
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,316
An old slipper!

176
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,952
Oh, please, God,
tell me this isn't real.

177
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:57,121
Please tell me I had a nervous
breakdown at the wedding, and now I'm

178
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:01,000
in a mental hospital on medication
that's giving me hallucinations.

179
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,553
Don't scare Insectosaurus!

180
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,348
He's gonna pee himself,
then we'll all be in trouble.

181
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:18,476
Every room has a door!
There's gotta be a door here!

182
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,813
It's OK, buddy. Don't worry about it.

183
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:25,942
Who's a handsome bug, huh?
You like it when I rub your tummy?

184
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:30,989
Please! Somebody!
I don't belong here!

185
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,992
- Let me out!
- Hey, that is not a good idea.

186
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,744
Let me out!

187
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,509
Monsters, get back in your cells.

188
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:16,826
Oh, thank goodness. A real person.
You are a real person, right?

189
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,662
Not one of those
half-person, half-machine,

190
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,206
you know, whatever
you call those things.

191
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,626
- A cyborg?
- Oh, no! You're a cyborg?!

192
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:30,423
Madam, I assure you, I am not a cyborg.
The name is General W.R. Monger.

193
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,593
I'm in charge of this facility.
Now, follow me.

194
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,012
It is time for your orientation.

195
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:50,318
In 1950, it was decided that Jane and
Joe Public could not handle the truth

196
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:54,697
about monsters, and should focus on more
important things, like paying taxes.

197
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,325
So the government convinced the world

198
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:01,496
monsters were stuff of myth and legend
and then locked them in this facility.

199
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,878
But I'm not a monster!
I'm just a regular person.

200
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:12,173
I'm not a danger to anyone or anything.

201
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:15,635
Don't let her get me!

202
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,178
Sorry.

203
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,438
- How long will I be here?
- Indefinitely.

204
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,315
- Can I contact my parents?
- No.

205
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,566
- Derek?
- Negative.

206
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:33,611
- Do they know where I am?
- No, and they never will!

207
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,863
This place is an X file,

208
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,408
wrapped in a cover-up
and deep-fried in a paranoid conspiracy.

209
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,912
There will be zero contact
with the outside world.

210
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:11,691
...seven, eight...

211
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,194
...999...

212
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,363
...1,000.

213
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,490
I can't believe I did ten sets.

214
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:30,877
Susan!

215
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:33,629
You wouldn't happen to have
any uranium on you?

216
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,089
I just need a smidge.

217
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,384
Rescind Dr. Cockroach's toy box
privileges immediately.

218
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:43,389
We had the prison psychologist
redecorate your cell.

219
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:44,849
Try to keep you all calm-like.

220
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:47,768
But I don't want a poster.

221
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,522
I want a real kitten hanging
from a real tree.

222
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,650
I want to go home.

223
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:58,404
Come on, little Debbie, please
don't cry. It makes my knees hurt.

224
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,114
Don't think of this as a prison.

225
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:05,119
Think of it as a hotel you never leave
because it's locked from the outside!

226
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,583
Oh, and one other thing.

227
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:13,502
The government has changed
your name to Ginormica.

228
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,306
Begin reanimation sequence.

229
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:16,148
Who dares to wake me?

230
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:22,238
Quantonium has been located on a
distant planet in the Omega Quadrant.

231
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:25,783
The Omega Quadrant? Lame.

232
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,287
The trajectory of the
Quantonium meteor

233
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:33,541
has been traced to sector 72-4,

234
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:37,169
the planet locally known as Earth.

235
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:40,673
What a miserable-looking mud ball.

236
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,217
Send a robot probe!

237
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,932
Extract the Quantonium
with extreme prejudice.

238
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,893
I want it all.

239
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,896
Every last drop!

240
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,232
Yes, Gallaxhar.

241
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,820
Nothing can stand in my way now.

242
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,927
Don't rush me, Katie!
I'm just not ready.

243
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:30,806
Relax, Cuthbert.
It's just like dancing. I'll lead.

244
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:37,772
Katie, I have a gymnastics
meet tomorrow. So maybe...

245
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,565
Did you open the top?

246
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,194
Thank goodness. It's the police.

247
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,947
- We weren't doing anything, officer!
- Yeah, nothing at all.

248
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,162
Jiminy!

249
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:57,958
Why did I even let you talk me into
this?! Maybe we should get out of here.

250
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:01,587
- Or, maybe, we should go check it out.
- Katie, are you nuts?!

251
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,423
Wait! Don't leave me alone!

252
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,471
No! My ankle!

253
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,056
I think it's broken!

254
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,141
Katie?

255
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,229
This is the worst date ever.

256
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,782
Katie, I'm frightened.

257
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:43,462
It was first spotted at midnight last
night by a couple in romantic embrace.

258
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:46,924
No one knows what it is
or where it came from.

259
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:50,845
All branches of the military
were immediately mobilized.

260
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,179
What is that, Henshaw?

261
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:53,889
OK.

262
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:58,269
I have just received word that
the president of the United States

263
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:02,314
has arrived and will
attempt to make first contact.

264
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,525
I must approach it alone.

265
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:07,695
This is all about
peaceful communication.

266
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:09,989
Yes, sir, Mr. President.

267
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:46,400
Perimeter stable. Got a bead
on Papa Bear. All clear.

268
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,867
- Let's go!
- Get out of the way!

269
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,660
Set her down now. Here we go!

270
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:15,799
Commander, do something violent!

271
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,218
You heard the president! Light 'em up!

272
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:30,814
We're getting pummeled here! Call in
air support! Call in air support!

273
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:54,922
Call in... Call in a full retreat!

274
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:57,716
Full retreat! Full retreat, all troops!

275
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,595
- Wheels up. Papa Bear is on the move.
- Wait.

276
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:06,433
So that's how you want to play it?
Eat lead, alien robot!

277
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,604
- Evidently, they eat lead.
- Get him on the chopper.

278
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,941
I'm brave! I'm a brave president!

279
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,070
Get out of the way!

280
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:37,965
- Sir! We need to declare a...
- We need to overthrow that robot

281
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:41,677
- and install our own government!
- Let's sacrifice the elderly to it!

282
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:44,805
- I say we invade it!
- The Earth only has two weeks left!

283
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:48,851
If that thing walks into a populated
area there'll be a major catastrophe!

284
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:51,812
We need our top scientific minds
on this. Get India on the phone!

285
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,939
Can we transport the United States
to a safer planet?

286
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:57,317
Give this alien a green card and
make him proud to be an American.

287
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:02,322
It's at dire times like this when I stop
and ask myself, "What would Oprah do?"

288
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:06,285
Hang it all! What's the point?
It's a disaster.

289
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:09,371
- Stop! No!
- Don't do it!

290
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,040
That button launches
our nuclear missiles!

291
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,001
Well, which button gets me a latte?

292
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,962
That would be the other one, sir.

293
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,969
- What idiot designed this thing?
- You did, sir.

294
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:28,307
- Fair enough. Wilson, fire somebody!
- Yes, sir, Mr. President.

295
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,769
Listen up. I'm not going
to go down in history

296
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,729
as the president who was in office

297
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,314
when the world came to an end,

298
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:38,150
so somebody think of something,
and think of it fast!

299
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,780
- That is a good cup of joe.
- Mr. President?

300
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:49,620
Not only do I have an idea,
but I have a plan!

301
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:57,002
Now, conventional weapons
have no effect on this thing,

302
00:29:57,086 --> 00:30:01,131
- and we know nukes ain't an option.
- Sure they are. I just...

303
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,759
- Don't do it! Stop!
- Wait!

304
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:07,971
I'm not gonna kid you, Mr. President.
These are dark times.

305
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:13,393
The odds are against us. We need a Hail
Mary pass. We need raw power! We need...

306
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,479
...monsters.

307
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:21,401
Monsters! Of course! It's so simple!

308
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,905
I... I'm not following you.

309
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,451
Over the last 50 years, I have captured
monsters on the rampage,

310
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:32,079
and locked them up
in a secret prison facility.

311
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:37,709
So secret that the mere mention
of its name is a federal offense.

312
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,336
Is he referring to Area Fifty...

313
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:46,218
Mr. President,
say hello to Insectosaurus!

314
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,055
Miss Ronson, please.

315
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:54,017
Nuclear radiation turned him
from a small grub

316
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:58,105
into a 350-foot-tall
monster that attacked Tokyo.

317
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:01,733
Here we have the Missing Link.

318
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:09,700
A 20,000-year-old frozen fish man
who was thawed out by scientists.

319
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:14,746
He escaped and went on a rampage
in his old watering hole.

320
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:18,292
This handsome fellow
is Dr. Cockroach, Ph.D.,

321
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,502
the most brilliant man in the world.

322
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:24,798
He invented a scientific machine

323
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:29,052
that would give humans
the cockroach's ability to survive.

324
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,722
Unfortunately, there was a side effect.

325
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,811
Now, we call this thing B.O.B.

326
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,564
Will someone get her out of here?!

327
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:43,984
Thank you.

328
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:48,405
A genetically altered tomato was
combined with a chemically altered

329
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:51,825
ranch-flavored dessert topping
at a snack food plant.

330
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,661
The resulting goop
gained consciousness,

331
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:58,248
and became an
indestructible gelatinous mass.

332
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:02,669
And, our latest addition, Ginormica.

333
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,425
General, continue.

334
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:12,721
Her entire body radiates
with pure energy,

335
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:15,307
giving her enormous strength and size.

336
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:20,771
Sir, these monsters are our best
and only chance to defeat that robot.

337
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:23,440
Don't we already have
an alien problem, General?

338
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:26,610
I don't think we need
a monster problem, too.

339
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,862
You got a better idea, nerd?

340
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,451
OK. Stay where you are.

341
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:38,038
General, I propose we go forward

342
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:41,458
with your monsters-versus-aliens
idea... thingy.

343
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:43,293
Go fish.

344
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,220
Do you...

345
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,722
...have any...

346
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,225
...threes?

347
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,603
Yes. I do! How are you doing this?

348
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:05,065
- You're the luckiest guy I know.
- Luck ain't got nothin' to do with it.

349
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,360
What the...? Hey!

350
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:16,576
They called me crazy,
but I'll show them. I'll show them all!

351
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:22,749
Doctor, I'd prefer you didn't do
your mad scientist laugh

352
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,751
while I'm hooked up to this machine.

353
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,714
You're right, Insecto.

354
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:32,467
You've let that quack experiment
on you for over a month.

355
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:36,722
I'm not a quack! I'm a mad scientist!
There is a difference.

356
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:41,935
Guys, what choice do I have? If he can
make me normal, or even six foot eight,

357
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:45,355
I can get out of here, get back
to the life I'm supposed to have.

358
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,733
- I should be in...
- Let me guess, Fresno?

359
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:51,528
Well, Fresno is just a stepping stone.
Next stop, Milwaukee.

360
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:54,948
- Then New York, then hopefully...
- Yeah, we know. Paris.

361
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,785
Throw the switch, Doctor,
but don't do the laugh.

362
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:02,289
Now you're going to feel
a slight pinch in the brain.

363
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,207
Sorry.

364
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,678
Susan!

365
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,723
Am I small again?

366
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:21,975
I'm afraid not, my dear.

367
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:30,150
In fact, you may actually
have grown a couple of feet.

368
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:36,656
That's OK, Doc.
We'll try again tomorrow.

369
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:41,912
You really don't get it, do you?
No monster has ever gotten out of here!

370
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:44,498
That's not true! The Invisible Man did.

371
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:48,460
No, he didn't. We just told you that
so you wouldn't get upset.

372
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:51,546
He died of a heart attack 25 years ago.

373
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:52,672
No!

374
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,509
Yeah... in that very chair.

375
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,136
He's still there.

376
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:04,851
You see what I'm saying? Nobody's
leaving. Nobody's ever getting out.

377
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:08,146
Good news, monsters! You're getting out!

378
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:09,815
Until today.

379
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:17,114
So let me get this straight, Monger.

380
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,825
You want us to fight an alien robot.

381
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:23,161
And, in exchange,
the president of these United States

382
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,831
authorized me to grant you
your freedom.

383
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:30,127
I can't believe it!
Soon, I'll be back in Derek's arms...

384
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,045
...or he'll be in mine.

385
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:35,132
I can't wait for spring break
back at Cocoa Beach, just

386
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,467
freaking everybody out.

387
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:41,429
And I'll go back to my lab
and finally finish my experiments.

388
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,056
No! That's me, B.O.B.

389
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,894
- Then I'll be a really giant lady.
- That's Susan, B.O.B.

390
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:52,149
Fine. Then I'll go back to Modesto
and be with Derek.

391
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,817
That's still Susan, B.O.B.

392
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:56,945
I think I, at least,
deserve a chance to be with Derek!

393
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,196
All right, let's go!

394
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:24,973
Everybody move in an orderly fashion!
This is an emergency!

395
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:27,017
We are evacuating the city!

396
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:30,103
Exact change is appreciated,
but not necessary!

397
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,593
Let's move out!

398
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:10,810
This is San Francisco!
This isn't far from my home!

399
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:14,940
Feel the wind on your antennae.
Isn’t this wonderful?

400
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:18,860
I haven't been outside in 50 years.
It's amazing out here!

401
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:21,988
It's hotter than I remember.
Has the Earth gotten warmer?

402
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:25,158
That'd be great to know.
That would be a very convenient truth.

403
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:34,000
- Now that's a robot!
- It's huge.

404
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,419
Try not to damage it too much.

405
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,672
I might want to bring it
back to the farm!

406
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:41,925
No, no, no, wait! You didn't say
anything about it being huge!

407
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:44,094
Wait! No! Don't leave!

408
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:49,724
I think he sees us.

409
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:53,353
Hello! Hi! How you doing?

410
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:56,856
Welcome! We are here to destroy you!

411
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:00,360
I can't fight that thing.
I can't even... I've never...

412
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:04,531
I'm hyperventilating.
Does anybody have a giant paper bag?

413
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,616
Relax.

414
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,785
Old Link's got this under control.

415
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:11,371
Hide in the city, Susan.
You'll be safe there.

416
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:14,541
But stay away from the Tenderloin!
It's a little dicey!

417
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:17,961
Finally, some action.
I'm gonna turn that oversized tin can

418
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:22,048
into a really dented oversized tin can.

419
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:30,307
OK! Does anybody have
a 20 on Insectosaurus?

420
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:33,810
Wow!
Would you look at the size of that...

421
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:34,936
Foot!

422
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,815
I got him, you guys! I got...

423
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:42,986
Don't worry, I won't let go!
I'm wearing him down!

424
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,739
Please tell me he's slowing down!

425
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:48,867
Get to the city, Link.
I'll catch up with you as soon as I can.

426
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:55,415
Or maybe you'll have to
catch up with me.

427
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:23,920
Oh, no! No, no, no!

428
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:53,867
OK, OK. I got this.

429
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,048
Yep, that hurt.

430
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:14,053
Get in! I have a plan!

431
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:27,525
Hot dogs!

432
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:39,579
All right, Link, I'm going to pull up
alongside it! You get up in there,

433
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:42,165
get to its
central processing unit, and...

434
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:44,209
- Hey, guys, catch me!
- No!

435
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:54,135
Let's go, let's go! Keep it moving!

436
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,762
Hey! No honking!

437
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:04,562
Excuse me! Coming through!
On your right! No control!

438
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:24,958
Oh, no.

439
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:39,347
OK! It's going to be OK!
Look, I'm gonna get you out of there!

440
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:42,809
Hold on a second!
We have to get off the bridge before...

441
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:12,338
No, no, no! Get away from me!

442
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:31,274
Coming through! Watch it!

443
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:39,824
Hey, furball, where you been?

444
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:45,288
Yeah, I know.
Papa's a little out of shape.

445
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:49,042
Excuse me! He's trying to kill me!
Why is it doing that? Why would it...

446
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:01,220
Wow.

447
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:22,408
- Wow. You're doing great!
- I'm doing everything!

448
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,828
Not for long. Come on, you guys.
Let's take this thing down!

449
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:31,417
A deflector shield. Typical.

450
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:42,220
You can't crush a cockroach!

451
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:54,065
Right, right.

452
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:55,775
Here we go.

453
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:01,489
Insectosaurus!

454
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:03,991
Insectosaurus!

455
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:05,702
- B.O.B.!
- What?

456
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:07,328
- Help me!
- Sorry.

457
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:11,457
- I was staring at this bird over there.
- Get these people off the bridge!

458
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:12,583
Got it.

459
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:17,630
No, B.O.B.!
Move the dividers!

460
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:21,342
Oh, yeah, you're right. My bad.

461
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:28,182
Go, go, go, go!

462
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:41,696
Link!

463
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:44,490
Oh, I don't feel good.

464
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:50,163
OK. Susan, you can do this.

465
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:40,129
All right. Let's take this thing down.

466
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,099
Retrieval has failed.

467
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:55,895
Don't get upset.
It happens to everyone.

468
00:46:56,897 --> 00:47:02,735
That lower life form thinks
she can steal my Quantonium?!

469
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:05,655
Send another probe at once!

470
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:08,616
Quantonium cannot
be retrieved via robot.

471
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:13,996
Carbon-based life form, locally known
as Susan, is now too strong.

472
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:18,835
Oh, you think because
you're all big and strong

473
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:22,004
and you can destroy my robot probe

474
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:24,966
that you're gonna send me
running and hiding?!

475
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:29,345
My days of running and hiding are over!

476
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:32,932
Computer, set a course to Earth.

477
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:37,228
I will retrieve the Quantonium myself,

478
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:40,773
even if I need to rip it out of her body

479
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:43,651
one cell at a time!

480
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:49,323
Careful, it's hot.

481
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:56,998
Three weeks ago, if you had asked me
to defeat a giant alien robot,

482
00:47:57,082 --> 00:48:00,209
I'd have said, "No can do."
But I did it! Me!

483
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:01,878
I'm still buzzing.

484
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:05,923
Did you see how strong I was?! Probably
isn't a jar in this world I can't open.

485
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:09,302
You were positively heroic, my dear.

486
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:12,263
I especially loved how you
saved those people on the bridge.

487
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:15,308
It was a nice touch.
Wasn't she amazing, Link?

488
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:18,811
Yeah, she was great.
Really cool. Loved it.

489
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:21,355
Oh, poor Link.

490
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:25,026
After all that tough talk,
you were out-monstered by a girl.

491
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:30,239
- No wonder you're depressed.
- Hey, I'm not depressed. I'm tired.

492
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,491
Why are you tired?
You didn't do anything.

493
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:34,493
Well, I haven't been sleeping well.

494
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:39,290
I got sleep apnes... apnea.
Whatever. It's not fun.

495
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:43,169
So Link's a little rusty...
I mean, sleep deprived.

496
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,713
You'll be back
to your old self in no time.

497
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:46,839
And so will I.

498
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:51,552
What happened to the "there isn't
a jar in the world I can't open" stuff?

499
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:55,097
Wait. Did you find a jar
you couldn't open? Were pickles in it?

500
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:59,185
- Where's the giant jar of pickles?!
- What my associate is trying to say

501
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:03,814
is that we all think the
new Susan is the "cat's me-wow."

502
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:07,318
I'm sorry.

503
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:11,864
Thanks, you guys. That is so sweet,

504
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:16,035
but I have a normal life
waiting for me. You know?

505
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:20,873
So, tell me, exactly, how this normal
life thing works with you being giant.

506
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,708
I'm not gonna be a giant forever.

507
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:26,295
Derek won't rest
until we've found a cure for my...

508
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:29,382
...condition. We're a team.

509
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:34,762
We could all do with a Derek. Perhaps,
someday, we could make his acquaintance!

510
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:38,224
Really? You guys want to meet Derek?

511
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,317
First stop, Modesto!

512
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:52,071
Ginormica, I called your family
to let them know you were coming home.

513
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:55,992
Now, I also called the Modesto PD
and told them not to shoot at you.

514
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:58,828
Thanks, General.

515
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:13,551
OK, remember,
these people aren't used to seeing...

516
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:15,511
...anything like...

517
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:18,597
...you, or you...

518
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:20,141
...or you.

519
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:24,270
So just be, you know, cool.
Just be... you know...

520
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:25,813
Follow my lead.

521
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:33,779
Stop! That was an accident!

522
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,948
Don't destroy anything!

523
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,286
Susan?

524
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:45,291
- Susie Q!
- Mom? Daddy?

525
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:52,131
- Did they experiment on you?
- No, Mom. I'm fine.

526
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:58,137
It's OK. They're with me.

527
00:50:58,305 --> 00:50:59,805
These are my new friends.

528
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:02,892
Oh, Derek! I missed you so much,

529
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:05,853
thinking that we'd
someday be together again!

530
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:09,732
It's the only thing that got me through
prison! I love you! I love this man!

531
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:13,027
No, B.O.B.! That's my mother!
You're suffocating her!

532
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:16,655
Honey, are you all right?

533
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:19,575
- I taste ham.
- Sorry, Mom.

534
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,410
He's just a hugger.

535
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:23,996
Where's Derek?

536
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,665
He's at work, sweetie.

537
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:29,794
You know how he is about his career.

538
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:32,963
- We're not gonna celebrate without him!
- Susan!

539
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:36,258
What do I do
with all your little friends?

540
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:39,720
Just put out some snacks!
They'll eat anything!

541
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:43,849
Ambrosia!

542
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:48,437
How's it going?

543
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,815
Qué pasa, girlfriend?

544
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,234
Way to cut up a rug, Insecto!

545
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,864
Who wants to go
for a swim with the Link?

546
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:08,791
Hi. I'm Benzoate-Ostylezene-Bicarbonate.

547
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:12,044
Or you can call me "B.O.B.",
whichever's easier.

548
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:15,506
Did I come on too strong? I'm sorry.

549
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:19,385
I'm a little rusty.
I've been in prison my whole life.

550
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:20,845
Why'd I mention prison?

551
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:25,015
I didn't mean to scare you.
I'm just going to go.

552
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:26,475
I feel so stupid.

553
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:32,106
All right, everyone, just stay calm.
Whatever you do, do not provoke them.

554
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:35,860
Anyone care for an Atomic Gin Fizz?
It's got quite a...

555
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:39,405
...kick.

556
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:43,576
Chlorine! Chlorine in my eyes!

557
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:49,290
- They're turning on us!
- Everyone run for your lives!

558
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:55,880
What are they running away from?

559
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:01,385
That's hilarious, Jim.

560
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:04,680
That's exactly the kind of
down-home country humor

561
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:06,515
I'm gonna miss when I'm in Fresno.

562
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:10,769
This is Derek Dietl,
signing off for the very last time.

563
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:15,274
- Good night, Modesto!
- Channel 172.

564
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:17,610
And cut.

565
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:23,115
Did you like that sign off?
Just made it up.

566
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:31,457
Oh, my goodness.

567
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:34,585
Wait, wait, wait! But, but...!

568
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:42,301
Oh, Derek. You wouldn't
believe my last three weeks!

569
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:49,099
Thinking about you was
the only thing that kept me sane.

570
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:54,480
- Can't breathe! Ribs collapsing!
- Oh, my gosh! I'm so sorry!

571
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:57,524
Oh, my goodness. Is that better?

572
00:53:58,526 --> 00:54:00,653
OK. OK.

573
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:04,406
I'm still kind of getting used to
my new strength.

574
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:07,076
Wow! You really are big!

575
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:12,331
Yeah, but I'm still me. I'm still
the same girl you fell in love with.

576
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:15,834
Except you did just destroy
the Golden Gate Bridge.

577
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:19,004
But that was the only way
I could stop that giant robot!

578
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:21,799
You ever think I could do
something like that?

579
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:26,220
No, I didn't. I can honestly say
it never, ever, ever, ever,

580
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:30,015
ever, ever, ever, ever,
ever, ever, ever occurred to me.

581
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:33,769
Look, I know this is a little weird.

582
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:37,815
OK, it's a lot weird,
but we'll figure it out.

583
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:41,944
I know that, together, we can find
a way to get me back to normal.

584
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:45,864
Susan, try and look at this
from my perspective.

585
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:48,951
I have an audience
that depends on me for news,

586
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:52,288
weather, sports
and heart-warming fluff pieces.

587
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:54,873
You expect me to put all that on hold

588
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,710
while you try to undo
this thing that happened to you?

589
00:54:57,794 --> 00:55:00,087
That I had absolutely
nothing to do with?

590
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:03,424
Yes. That's exactly what I expect.

591
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:08,262
What about the life we always
talked about? Don't you still want that?

592
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:10,556
Of course. I just...

593
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:14,101
...don't see how
I can have that with you.

594
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:18,147
Derek, please, don't do this.

595
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,858
You have to face facts, Susan.

596
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:24,862
Don't crush me for saying this,
but I'm not looking to get married

597
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:27,948
and spend the rest of my life
in someone else's shadow.

598
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:32,328
And you're casting a pretty big shadow.

599
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,913
I'm sorry. It's over.

600
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:38,208
Good luck, Susan.

601
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:28,592
Wow! What a shindig!

602
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:31,970
Your parents really know
how to throw it down.

603
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:35,140
What? No, that was a great party,

604
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:37,976
one of the best I've been to
since I got out of prison.

605
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,437
I must have been at a different party,

606
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:43,148
'cause that's not
how I interpreted it at all.

607
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:47,653
I don't think your parents liked me, and
that JELL-O gave me a fake phone number.

608
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:51,657
Well, at least the garbage was free.
You know? I mean...

609
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,661
Ah, who are we kidding?
We could save every city on the planet,

610
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:59,289
and they'd still treat us the same way
they've always treated us...

611
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:00,999
...like monsters.

612
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:05,295
Right. Monsters.

613
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:10,050
Anyway, how is Derek?

614
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:17,766
Derek is a selfish jerk.

615
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:19,351
- No!
- Yes.

616
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:23,522
All that talk about "us."
"I'm so proud of us."

617
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:26,733
"Us just got a job in Fresno."
There's no "us."

618
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:31,655
There was only Derek. Why did I have to
get hit by a meteor to see that?

619
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:33,866
I was such an idiot!

620
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:39,496
Why did I ever think life with Derek
would be so great, anyway?

621
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:42,666
I mean, look at all the stuff
I've done without him.

622
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:46,670
Fighting an alien robot?
That was me, not him.

623
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:51,884
And that was amazing!
Meeting you guys? Amazing.

624
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:55,137
Dr. Cockroach, you can crawl up walls

625
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:59,725
and build a supercomputer out of a
pizza box, two cans of hairspray, and...

626
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:02,060
- A paper clip!
- Amazing!

627
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:05,564
And you! You hardly need an
introduction. You're the Missing Link!

628
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:08,567
You personally carried
250 co-eds off of Cocoa Beach,

629
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:10,903
and still had strength
to fight off the National Guard!

630
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:13,739
And the Coast Guard
and, also, the lifeguard.

631
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:14,907
Amazing!

632
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:17,534
B.O.B.! Who else could fall

633
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:20,787
from unimaginable heights
and end up without a single scratch?

634
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:22,831
- Link?
- You.

635
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:23,999
Amazing!

636
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:30,797
Good point, Insecto!
Susan, don't short-change yourself!

637
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:34,885
Oh, I'm not going to
short-change myself ever again!

638
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:37,346
- Testify!
- Yeah.

639
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:38,639
Oh, yes.

640
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:46,021
Susan!

641
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,405
Way to go, Insecto!

642
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:08,460
Insecto, look out!

643
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:17,427
Insectosaurus! No!

644
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:26,478
You're gonna make it.

645
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:30,399
It's going to be all right. Look at me.

646
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:34,111
Don't you close those eyes.
Don't you dare close those eyes.

647
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:36,822
You can't...

648
01:00:15,903 --> 01:00:18,155
You must be terrified.

649
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:23,076
You wake up in a strange place,
wearing strange clothes,

650
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:28,290
imprisoned by a strange being
floating on a strange hovering device.

651
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:30,208
Strange, isn't it?

652
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:33,045
Hardly. It's not the first time.

653
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,714
Wow. You really get around.

654
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:38,675
To the extraction chamber!

655
01:00:39,552 --> 01:00:41,762
Look. What is it that you want from me?

656
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:45,557
You have stolen what is rightfully mine!

657
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:47,476
I didn't steal anything from you.

658
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:51,730
Your enormous, grotesque body
contains Quantonium,

659
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:54,941
the most powerful substance
in the universe.

660
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:58,487
Did you really think
you could keep it from me?

661
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:01,490
That's what this is all about?

662
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:06,328
You destroyed San Francisco,
you terrified millions of people...

663
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:09,081
...you killed my friend,
just to get to me?

664
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:14,961
Silence!
Your voice is grating on my ear nubs.

665
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:20,676
It's a shame you won't be around to see
what the power of Quantonium

666
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:25,931
can do in the tentacles
of someone who knows how to use it!

667
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:28,433
I know how to use it just fine!

668
01:01:28,893 --> 01:01:33,563
Don't bother.
That force field is impenetrab...

669
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,108
What the Flagnard?!

670
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:51,248
That should stop your puny...

671
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:53,959
Computer, close door, hangar two!

672
01:01:55,002 --> 01:01:56,503
Close door, hangar three!

673
01:01:57,588 --> 01:01:58,797
Door, hangar four!

674
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:01,758
Close them all!

675
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:50,140
Computer, begin extraction!

676
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:37,562
Finally, I can rebuild my
civilization on a new planet.

677
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:41,316
Any thoughts on where
I should set up shop?

678
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:43,443
Your planet, perhaps?

679
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:46,112
You keep your
slimy tentacles off my planet!

680
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:48,907
If you wanted to stop me,
you should have done it

681
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,992
when you possessed the Quantonium!

682
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:52,911
Now you're nothing.

683
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:56,915
There are innocent people
down there who didn't do anything!

684
01:03:58,584 --> 01:04:02,963
There were innocent people on my
home planet before it was destroyed.

685
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:06,174
- I'm sorry your planet was destroyed.
- Oh, don't be.

686
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:09,094
I'm the one who destroyed it. Confused?

687
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:16,184
After I reveal my tale to you,
everything will become crystal clear.

688
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:19,896
Computer, initialize cloning machine.

689
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:21,439
Yes, Gallaxhar.

690
01:04:22,775 --> 01:04:26,653
Many zentons ago,
when I was but a squidling,

691
01:04:26,737 --> 01:04:29,155
I found out my parents were...

692
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:35,245
No child should ever
have to endure that!

693
01:04:35,329 --> 01:04:37,622
So I went on the road with a giant...

694
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:42,294
And soon thereafter was married!

695
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:45,589
Things were going well,
until she wanted to...

696
01:04:47,925 --> 01:04:51,720
And then I was all, "No way!", and she
was all, "Yes, way," and I was like...

697
01:04:54,181 --> 01:04:56,641
But I've told you too much already!

698
01:04:58,644 --> 01:05:02,689
Let the birth of my new planet,
now called...

699
01:05:03,649 --> 01:05:06,985
..."Gallaxhar's Planet" begin!

700
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:36,848
Once again,
a UFO has landed in America,

701
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:40,060
the only country UFO's
ever seem to land in.

702
01:05:40,144 --> 01:05:42,771
Excuse me. What's that, Henshaw?

703
01:05:43,648 --> 01:05:45,607
Okey-dokey.

704
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:52,322
We now take you, live, to a transmission
from the alien spacecraft.

705
01:05:54,825 --> 01:05:58,036
Humans of Earth, I have come in peace.

706
01:05:58,537 --> 01:06:03,041
You need not fear me.
I mean you no harm.

707
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:08,421
However, it is important to note most of
you will not survive the next 24 hours.

708
01:06:08,881 --> 01:06:12,634
And those who do survive will be
enslaved and experimented on.

709
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:15,845
You should in no way
take any of this personally.

710
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:20,392
It's just business. So just to recap:

711
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:25,063
I come in peace, I mean you no harm
and you all will die. Gallaxhar out.

712
01:06:30,277 --> 01:06:32,404
OK, boys, set the terror level

713
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:35,365
at code brown
'cause I need to change my pants.

714
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:52,090
- What're we gonna do now, Doc?
- I...

715
01:06:53,592 --> 01:06:54,676
I don't know.

716
01:06:55,636 --> 01:07:00,473
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
We're not gonna let Insecto die in vain.

717
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:06,479
We're gonna get up there, find Susan,
and we're gonna take that alien down!

718
01:07:11,652 --> 01:07:15,155
All right, you got enough juice
in those jetpacks to get up there,

719
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:16,781
but not enough to make it home.

720
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:22,412
I'll come get you if I can.
If I don't, it means I'm dead. Or late.

721
01:07:23,622 --> 01:07:26,708
I've been your warden
for close to 50 years.

722
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:28,960
That's no longer the case.

723
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:31,129
For what it's worth...

724
01:07:32,631 --> 01:07:36,760
- That's rude. What did we do?
- No, B.O.B., that's not rude.

725
01:07:36,844 --> 01:07:39,054
That's a sign of respect.

726
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:50,482
General, it's targeting us!

727
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:53,276
That's the idea, Lieutenant.
Hold your course.

728
01:07:53,944 --> 01:07:54,986
Steady.

729
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:57,322
Steady.

730
01:07:58,365 --> 01:07:59,824
Hard right! Hard right!

731
01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:04,662
I can't shake it!

732
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:11,002
Hang on to your socks!
We're going for a ride!

733
01:08:22,973 --> 01:08:26,101
That's why I always
wear a parachute, Lieutenant.

734
01:08:29,396 --> 01:08:31,815
You can let go of me now, Lieutenant.

735
01:09:05,057 --> 01:09:07,225
Who are you signaling?
We're right here.

736
01:09:07,351 --> 01:09:08,393
Hey, zip it!

737
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:17,360
Clone!

738
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:21,698
- Hail Gallaxhar!
- No, not all of you. You, there.

739
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:24,701
How do I do this? Three back.

740
01:09:24,785 --> 01:09:28,246
No, no, no, no. That guy next to you.
The one I'm pointing at!

741
01:09:28,372 --> 01:09:29,414
You! The one...

742
01:09:31,041 --> 01:09:33,168
You, clone! Yes! Good!

743
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:37,338
Take the prisoner to the incinerator.

744
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:39,757
She's useless to us now.

745
01:09:40,092 --> 01:09:42,510
- Hail Gallaxhar.
- Hail me.

746
01:09:57,151 --> 01:10:01,529
Wow. Ginormica ain't so...
"ginormic" anymore.

747
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:03,448
How are we supposed to get to her?

748
01:10:03,574 --> 01:10:06,326
There's too many of them.
It's impossible.

749
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:15,418
I may not have a brain, gentlemen,
but I have an idea.

750
01:10:21,759 --> 01:10:23,426
This is not going to work.

751
01:10:36,815 --> 01:10:37,899
Halt!

752
01:10:41,987 --> 01:10:47,992
I... Gallaxhar, command you
to hand over the prisoner this instant.

753
01:10:48,994 --> 01:10:51,537
Clearly, you are defective
beyond repair.

754
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:54,749
Guards, take this defective clone
to the incinerator!

755
01:10:58,379 --> 01:11:01,256
Well, what are you waiting for?
You and you!

756
01:11:02,174 --> 01:11:05,260
- Seriously?
- Yes! Take the prisoner

757
01:11:05,344 --> 01:11:08,846
and the defective clone
to the incinerator!

758
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:13,309
- Of course, sir.
- Here's a security pass, just in case.

759
01:11:14,895 --> 01:11:17,021
- Would you like a gun?
- Yes, I would.

760
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:18,690
Hey, guys, look.

761
01:11:22,152 --> 01:11:23,820
OK.

762
01:11:25,197 --> 01:11:28,866
I can't believe you guys
came to save me. Thank you.

763
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:32,161
Don't mention it.
We monsters got to stick together.

764
01:11:32,579 --> 01:11:36,291
But I'm not a monster anymore.
I'm just me.

765
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:40,211
My dear, no matter what your size,
you'll always be...

766
01:11:41,046 --> 01:11:44,215
...nothing but a filthy,
carbon-based life form!

767
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:46,175
Hail Gallaxhar!

768
01:11:46,593 --> 01:11:47,885
Hail Gallaxhar.

769
01:11:52,182 --> 01:11:54,183
These disguises are the bomb!

770
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:56,936
That's it! Follow me.

771
01:11:58,022 --> 01:12:00,189
- The only way to save the Earth...
- Hail Gallaxhar!

772
01:12:00,274 --> 01:12:01,607
Hail Gallaxhar. The only way...

773
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:03,359
- Hail Gallaxhar!
- Hail Gallaxhar.

774
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:06,029
...to save the Earth
is to blow up this ship...

775
01:12:06,113 --> 01:12:08,239
- Hail Gallaxhar!
- Hail Gallaxhar.

776
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:11,326
- ...before the invasion starts.
- How are we gonna do this?

777
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:13,911
We need to find the main power core.

778
01:12:14,371 --> 01:12:17,373
Excuse me, could you direct us
to the main power core?

779
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:20,418
Gladly. It's right there,
above the extraction chamber.

780
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:34,557
Thank you very much. Hail Gallaxhar.

781
01:12:34,641 --> 01:12:36,059
- Watch out!
- Look out, brainless!

782
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:38,644
Give me that thing!

783
01:12:38,729 --> 01:12:42,106
A weapon like this needs to be
in the hands of someone responsible.

784
01:12:44,068 --> 01:12:45,526
What?!

785
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:48,738
Hail Gallaxhar?

786
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:50,782
Monsters!

787
01:12:50,991 --> 01:12:53,493
- Monsters.
- Monsters?!

788
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:58,915
Attention, all aliens!
Destroy all monsters!

789
01:13:00,959 --> 01:13:02,210
You want some of this?!

790
01:13:03,087 --> 01:13:04,128
Ninja!

791
01:13:08,258 --> 01:13:11,677
You want to hurt my friends,
you'll have to go through me!

792
01:13:14,431 --> 01:13:15,473
Oh, yeah.

793
01:13:37,371 --> 01:13:38,413
Susan!

794
01:13:45,504 --> 01:13:46,921
I can't believe we made it!

795
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:08,693
O... M... G.

796
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:11,654
Warning: Intruder.

797
01:14:13,365 --> 01:14:16,284
You'll never figure out my color code.

798
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:20,204
A hexadecimal color code system.

799
01:14:20,372 --> 01:14:22,206
This won't be but a moment.

800
01:14:23,834 --> 01:14:26,461
Red, green, blue,
yellow, orange, baby blue,

801
01:14:26,545 --> 01:14:30,214
purple, pink, mauve, gold,
brown, mocha, avocado, adobe gold!

802
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:39,223
Doc, come on, dance!

803
01:14:40,017 --> 01:14:44,562
Your busted, tired dance moves
are no match for my security protocols.

804
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:48,983
- We can't hold them off much longer!
- One thing you don't know about me!

805
01:14:49,693 --> 01:14:52,570
My Ph.D... is in...

806
01:14:54,072 --> 01:14:56,240
...dance! Dance! Dance!

807
01:14:57,034 --> 01:14:59,243
Security protocol breached.

808
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:02,914
Ship has been set to self-destruct.

809
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:07,627
Total annihilation
in T-minus six minutes.

810
01:15:08,045 --> 01:15:12,089
- Well, launch the invasion then!
- Invasion no longer possible.

811
01:15:12,299 --> 01:15:14,550
Oh, space balls!

812
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:19,055
Divert the Quantonium to the bridge,
and prepare my escape capsule!

813
01:15:33,820 --> 01:15:37,073
Look at that! They're all
running scared! Monsters win!

814
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:39,784
I don't think
that's why they're running.

815
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:44,372
Ship will self-destruct
in T-minus five minutes.

816
01:15:47,751 --> 01:15:48,793
Hail Gallaxhar!

817
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:51,045
We're not gonna make it!

818
01:15:58,679 --> 01:15:59,804
Hang on!

819
01:16:06,812 --> 01:16:07,979
Keep going!

820
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:19,991
It's no use. It won't budge.

821
01:16:20,659 --> 01:16:23,286
If I was still Ginormica,
I could do this!

822
01:16:23,370 --> 01:16:25,663
Get out of here
while you still got the chance!

823
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:29,417
No! Don't say that.
I'm not leaving you guys.

824
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:31,919
Yes, you are.
Rendezvous with Monger.

825
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:35,923
He's outside the ship, waiting for you.
Go while there's still time.

826
01:16:36,675 --> 01:16:41,053
Ship will self-destruct
in T-minus four minutes.

827
01:16:41,179 --> 01:16:42,847
Don't you worry about us, Susan.

828
01:16:42,931 --> 01:16:45,558
You finally have a chance
to get your old life back.

829
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:48,311
I don't want my old life back.

830
01:16:56,528 --> 01:16:58,404
They think they've stopped me?!

831
01:16:58,488 --> 01:17:00,698
They've stopped nothing.

832
01:17:00,824 --> 01:17:05,077
Female carbon-based life form,
or Susan, not contained.

833
01:17:05,162 --> 01:17:06,370
What?!

834
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:17,423
Attention, robot probes!
Crush the earthling!

835
01:17:46,453 --> 01:17:48,704
Robot bay has been destroyed.

836
01:17:49,706 --> 01:17:51,666
Fire phasoid cannon!

837
01:18:14,981 --> 01:18:17,483
Are you crazy?!
You could have killed me!

838
01:18:17,567 --> 01:18:19,527
Then we understand each other.

839
01:18:19,945 --> 01:18:22,988
Now, open the doors
and let my friends go.

840
01:18:23,115 --> 01:18:24,365
Or what?

841
01:18:24,449 --> 01:18:28,077
You don't actually think
you're a match for me, do you?

842
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:34,667
Quantonium has been
successfully diverted to the bridge.

843
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:37,878
Escape capsule ready for transport.

844
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:41,215
Like I told you before,
you should have defeated me

845
01:18:41,299 --> 01:18:43,467
when you had the Quantonium.

846
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:46,387
Have fun exploding!

847
01:19:12,330 --> 01:19:16,584
- Now open the doors.
- Even if I wanted to, I couldn't!

848
01:19:16,668 --> 01:19:19,795
That's what happens
when you set a ship to self-destruct!

849
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:22,006
Now we're all going to die!

850
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:25,551
And there's nothing
you can do about it, Susan!

851
01:19:27,637 --> 01:19:29,430
I wouldn't be so sure.

852
01:19:29,973 --> 01:19:32,141
And the name is Ginormica.

853
01:19:44,863 --> 01:19:49,533
Total annihilation
in T-minus one minute.

854
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:52,870
- It's been an honor knowing you, Doc.
- The feeling's mutual.

855
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:55,748
I'll see you guys tomorrow for lunch.

856
01:19:55,874 --> 01:19:57,041
That's right, B.O.B.

857
01:19:57,125 --> 01:20:00,044
And there'll be candy
and cake and balloons.

858
01:20:00,128 --> 01:20:05,382
Cake and balloons for lunch?! It's gonna
be the best day ever! I love you guys!

859
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:20,648
By Hawking's chair!

860
01:20:38,708 --> 01:20:44,547
Total annihilation
in T-minus 30 seconds.

861
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:49,593
- Where's Monger?!
- He's supposed to be here!

862
01:20:49,719 --> 01:20:53,430
He said the only reason he wouldn't
be here is if he was dead!

863
01:20:56,768 --> 01:20:58,185
Or late!

864
01:21:02,566 --> 01:21:05,109
Insectosaurus?! You're alive!

865
01:21:06,152 --> 01:21:08,612
And you're a... butterfly!

866
01:21:13,493 --> 01:21:14,535
Eight...

867
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,161
...seven...

868
01:21:16,746 --> 01:21:17,788
...six...

869
01:21:18,623 --> 01:21:19,623
...five...

870
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:21,417
...four...

871
01:21:21,793 --> 01:21:24,795
- ...three... two...
- Come on, come on!

872
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:26,255
...one.

873
01:21:29,217 --> 01:21:31,510
Nothing happened. Maybe my count was...

874
01:21:38,476 --> 01:21:39,977
There they are!

875
01:21:40,645 --> 01:21:42,438
Here they come!

876
01:21:57,621 --> 01:21:58,662
Yeah!

877
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:01,957
Oh, great.

878
01:22:05,837 --> 01:22:06,879
Oh, boy.

879
01:22:07,881 --> 01:22:10,841
- Susie Q!
- Daddy!

880
01:22:10,967 --> 01:22:15,804
Oh, Susan. Ever since you were a baby,
I knew that someday...

881
01:22:15,889 --> 01:22:20,225
...you would, you know, save the Earth
from an invasion from outer space.

882
01:22:20,518 --> 01:22:23,187
Thank you, but it wasn't just me, Mom.

883
01:22:23,271 --> 01:22:26,023
Excuse me! Hello!
Coming through! How are you?

884
01:22:26,441 --> 01:22:28,984
- Susan!
- Derek?

885
01:22:29,069 --> 01:22:32,404
Baby, I thought long and hard
about what happened between us.

886
01:22:32,489 --> 01:22:34,114
And I want you to know...

887
01:22:35,033 --> 01:22:36,158
...I forgive you.

888
01:22:37,202 --> 01:22:38,661
You forgive me?

889
01:22:38,745 --> 01:22:42,748
Of course. It wasn't your fault you got
hit by a meteor and ruined everything.

890
01:22:42,874 --> 01:22:43,916
And you know what?

891
01:22:44,376 --> 01:22:48,253
I say maybe you didn't ruin everything.
I just got a call from New York.

892
01:22:49,047 --> 01:22:51,465
They offered me network.

893
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:54,551
All I have to do is get
an exclusive interview from you.

894
01:22:55,261 --> 01:22:56,637
- Really?
- Yeah.

895
01:22:56,721 --> 01:22:59,723
I get my dream job
and you get your dream guy.

896
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:02,559
It's a win-win for Team Dietl.

897
01:23:03,853 --> 01:23:04,895
Derek...

898
01:23:05,855 --> 01:23:07,439
...that's amazing.

899
01:23:08,775 --> 01:23:11,318
- Is the camera rolling?
- Absolutely.

900
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:15,906
Good. Because I wouldn't want
your fans to miss this.

901
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:19,159
This is Susan Murphy, saying,

902
01:23:19,244 --> 01:23:22,579
"Goodbye, Derek!"

903
01:23:26,418 --> 01:23:27,459
B.O.B., could you...?

904
01:23:33,508 --> 01:23:36,927
Derek, you are a selfish jerk,
and guess what?

905
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:39,805
I've met someone else.
She's lime green.

906
01:23:39,931 --> 01:23:43,017
She has 14 little chunks
of pineapple inside her,

907
01:23:43,101 --> 01:23:46,353
and she's everything
I deserve in life!

908
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:49,023
I'm happy now, Derek, without you!

909
01:23:49,399 --> 01:23:50,941
It's over!

910
01:23:52,777 --> 01:23:54,278
Turn it off.

911
01:23:54,404 --> 01:23:57,114
Monsters, I'm so proud of you,
I could cry,

912
01:23:57,198 --> 01:23:59,658
if I hadn't lost my tear ducts
in the war.

913
01:23:59,743 --> 01:24:03,120
But not crying will have to wait.
The world needs you again.

914
01:24:03,663 --> 01:24:04,913
What is it, General?

915
01:24:04,998 --> 01:24:08,042
Seems a snail fell into
a French nuclear reactor.

916
01:24:08,334 --> 01:24:11,462
As we speak, Escargantua

917
01:24:11,546 --> 01:24:15,132
is slowly making its way to Paris.

918
01:24:16,342 --> 01:24:20,220
Well, I've always wanted to go to Paris.
Now who's with me?

919
01:24:20,305 --> 01:24:23,015
What do you say, Butterfly... osaurus?

920
01:24:25,101 --> 01:24:26,143
We're in.

921
01:24:26,519 --> 01:24:28,395
- I'm in!
- Count me in, too.

922
01:24:34,152 --> 01:24:35,986
Au revoir, sweetie!

923
01:24:36,613 --> 01:24:39,823
- Have a safe flight!
- Yeah, and hang on!

924
01:24:52,962 --> 01:24:56,173
Goodbye, Derek!
Good luck getting over me.

925
01:24:56,841 --> 01:25:00,135
B.O.B., it's me
he's never going to get over.

926
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:03,555
Wait, wait! You were dating Derek too?!

927
01:25:04,849 --> 01:25:06,475
That two-timing jerk!

928
01:26:38,484 --> 01:26:42,362
Everyone, let's welcome my new chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

929
01:26:42,488 --> 01:26:44,656
General W.R. Monger!

930
01:26:44,782 --> 01:26:49,161
Thank you, Mr. President. What a
great way to celebrate my 90th birthday.

931
01:26:49,412 --> 01:26:51,121
Very good, Warren. All right.

932
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:54,249
Let's get it started in here
Nerd?

933
01:26:55,084 --> 01:26:58,253
Gentlemen, I have assembled
a preliminary budget estimate

934
01:26:58,338 --> 01:27:00,464
for the rebuilding of San Francisco.

935
01:27:00,548 --> 01:27:02,716
Zoinkers. This is going
to be a boring one.

936
01:27:03,301 --> 01:27:06,553
Good time for a cup of joe.
Warren, how do you take it?

937
01:27:06,638 --> 01:27:09,431
Hit me with a double venti
organic chocolate brownie

938
01:27:09,515 --> 01:27:12,517
caramel Frappuccino, extra hot,
with one inch of foam...

939
01:27:12,810 --> 01:27:15,604
- ...non-fat.
- You got it! Black it is.

940
01:27:15,688 --> 01:27:16,772
Don't do it!

941
01:27:16,856 --> 01:27:17,898
Wait!

942
01:27:18,149 --> 01:27:20,901
My God, man! What have you done?!

943
01:27:22,153 --> 01:27:24,738
Time to wave the white flag
and head for the bunker.

944
01:27:24,948 --> 01:27:27,324
Let's check on the situation
in 500 years.

945
01:27:27,617 --> 01:27:28,951
Who wants to freeze my head?

946
01:27:29,305 --> 01:28:29,526
