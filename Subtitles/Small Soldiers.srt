00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,416
<i>GloboTech Industries, long recognized
as the worldwide leader...</i>

3
00:01:05,503 --> 00:01:08,919
<i>...in high-tech weaponry,
is now reaching even higher.</i>

4
00:01:09,006 --> 00:01:11,498
<i>Under the leadership of CEO, Gil Mars...</i>

5
00:01:11,592 --> 00:01:16,469
<i>...GloboTech engineers are blazing the trail
into tomorrow's most exciting sector.</i>

6
00:01:16,806 --> 00:01:19,262
<i>Introducing advanced
battlefield technology...</i>

7
00:01:19,351 --> 00:01:22,103
<i>...into consumer products
for the whole family.</i>

8
00:01:22,187 --> 00:01:26,101
<i>For the first time, you and yours will enjoy
the same high quality standards...</i>

9
00:01:26,191 --> 00:01:30,484
<i>...as demanded by the Defense Department,
at private sector prices.</i>

10
00:01:30,571 --> 00:01:35,362
<i>GloboTech, turning swords into plowshares
for you and your family.</i>

11
00:02:01,017 --> 00:02:03,424
He's here. He's early.

12
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,436
He's not supposed to be here yet.
He said...

13
00:02:07,607 --> 00:02:09,480
Slamfist optimal. Good. Check.

14
00:02:10,943 --> 00:02:12,603
Chickens.

15
00:02:13,613 --> 00:02:15,440
Let me help you with these.

16
00:02:16,449 --> 00:02:17,694
Pretty exciting, huh?

17
00:02:17,783 --> 00:02:21,200
I don't know. I think it's kind of sad.

18
00:02:21,329 --> 00:02:24,615
Heartland Toys has a long tradition
of bringing joy to kids.

19
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:26,829
Gil Mars won't care about that.

20
00:02:26,917 --> 00:02:28,874
He's just going to care about profits.

21
00:02:28,961 --> 00:02:30,124
I think it sucks.

22
00:02:30,212 --> 00:02:33,249
Welcome to Earth. You may not be
familiar with our customs...

23
00:02:33,341 --> 00:02:36,212
...but things work like this down here,
in the real world.

24
00:02:36,302 --> 00:02:38,093
Well, the real world sucks.

25
00:02:38,221 --> 00:02:40,260
It does have its perks.

26
00:02:41,431 --> 00:02:46,059
Gentlemen, I'm Ms. Kegel,
executive assistant to Mr. Mars.

27
00:02:48,606 --> 00:02:51,524
Let me be the first to welcome you
to the GloboTech family.

28
00:02:51,609 --> 00:02:57,195
Just as he's done with his computer,
telecommunications and food divisions...

29
00:02:57,323 --> 00:03:01,272
...Mr. Mars intends to bring his own
personal touch to Heartland Play Systems.

30
00:03:01,953 --> 00:03:03,032
Well, that's good.

31
00:03:07,165 --> 00:03:08,625
All right.

32
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:10,623
These are...

33
00:03:11,796 --> 00:03:13,339
Where's everybody else?

34
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:15,462
There is no longer any "everybody else".

35
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:17,626
Mr. Mars, it's an honor...

36
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:20,802
Cut the kiss-ass.
After I leave, I won't remember your name.

37
00:03:20,888 --> 00:03:22,167
This is Irwin Wayfair.

38
00:03:22,681 --> 00:03:25,765
I'm told you two are responsible for this.

39
00:03:25,893 --> 00:03:29,227
Yes, sir. That's Flatchoo,
he's part of the Belch Brigade.

40
00:03:29,396 --> 00:03:31,886
Actually, the whole line was Irwin's idea.

41
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,319
Once I did the marketing, it was the most
successful product in company history.

42
00:03:40,408 --> 00:03:43,907
That's why I bought the place
and why you two are still onboard.

43
00:03:44,119 --> 00:03:46,691
So, let's talk about the future.

44
00:03:53,296 --> 00:03:57,458
Okay, these are Gorgonites. They...
Hi. How are you today?

45
00:03:57,549 --> 00:03:58,628
I'm late.

46
00:03:59,342 --> 00:04:02,545
Okay. I drew up some pictures.

47
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:04,838
That's a picture you can have.

48
00:04:06,808 --> 00:04:10,012
All right, these are Gorgonites.

49
00:04:10,104 --> 00:04:11,218
And this one.

50
00:04:11,312 --> 00:04:15,061
This is Archer.
He's the grand, noble leader of...

51
00:04:15,567 --> 00:04:18,105
Okay, and Troglokhan...

52
00:04:18,195 --> 00:04:21,029
...the navigator who navigates.

53
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:25,569
Okay, they're monsters
from the land of Gorgon.

54
00:04:25,659 --> 00:04:28,780
They've come to our world and are lost.
To return to Gorgon...

55
00:04:28,871 --> 00:04:31,659
...they have to learn all about our world.

56
00:04:31,748 --> 00:04:34,668
This way, kids can learn and do research...

57
00:04:34,753 --> 00:04:37,040
Excuse me. Did you say "learn"?

58
00:04:37,547 --> 00:04:39,005
Learn, yeah.

59
00:04:40,092 --> 00:04:40,790
Next.

60
00:04:42,302 --> 00:04:43,712
Mr. Mars...

61
00:04:44,887 --> 00:04:47,558
...let me introduce you to...

62
00:04:49,767 --> 00:04:51,260
...Major...

63
00:04:54,021 --> 00:04:57,522
...Chip Hazard,
leader of the Commando Elite.

64
00:05:00,653 --> 00:05:03,654
It's called multimedia, Irwin. Look into it.

65
00:05:07,076 --> 00:05:09,365
<i>The future is here.</i>

66
00:05:09,829 --> 00:05:12,155
<i>A new age has dawned...</i>

67
00:05:13,499 --> 00:05:15,492
<i>...for action!</i>

68
00:05:22,884 --> 00:05:26,217
<i>The world's most awesome
high-tech fighting force...</i>

69
00:05:26,304 --> 00:05:29,803
<i>...is ready to battle for
the next millennium.</i>

70
00:05:29,974 --> 00:05:32,051
<i>Chip Hazard, reporting for duty!</i>

71
00:05:32,143 --> 00:05:33,802
Wait. Hold on.

72
00:05:34,687 --> 00:05:37,772
Hold on, hold on. Can they really do that?

73
00:05:38,191 --> 00:05:40,563
- Do what?
- Punch out of the box.

74
00:05:41,444 --> 00:05:42,274
No.

75
00:05:42,862 --> 00:05:44,321
I didn't think so.

76
00:05:44,405 --> 00:05:47,773
There's a disclaimer.
Legal says we're completely covered.

77
00:05:48,158 --> 00:05:49,902
You know what I'm sick of?

78
00:05:50,494 --> 00:05:53,864
Commercials showing trucks
popping up on Mount Rushmore...

79
00:05:53,957 --> 00:05:56,079
...and parking on Abraham Lincoln's head.

80
00:05:56,209 --> 00:05:59,826
And shampoo commercials that say
women can look like Claudia Schiffer...

81
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,493
...after one cycle of rinse and repeat.

82
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,378
What if these toys actually could talk?

83
00:06:05,467 --> 00:06:08,801
What if they could walk?
What if they could actually kick ass?

84
00:06:09,263 --> 00:06:10,211
<i>Nick Nitro.</i>

85
00:06:11,015 --> 00:06:13,885
Toys that are so smart
when kids play with them...

86
00:06:13,975 --> 00:06:15,351
...they play back.

87
00:06:15,436 --> 00:06:19,019
Toys that actually do what they do
in the commercials.

88
00:06:19,691 --> 00:06:21,563
That's an interesting idea.

89
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,607
Forget the "Batteries not included" crap.

90
00:06:23,693 --> 00:06:26,066
Put in a lifetime GloboTech lithium cell.

91
00:06:26,155 --> 00:06:29,322
They'll run forever.
That'll piss off the guys at Eveready.

92
00:06:30,952 --> 00:06:35,162
How's this slogan? "The Commando Elite.
Anything else is just a toy."

93
00:06:35,413 --> 00:06:37,536
"Everything else is just a toy."

94
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,783
That's good, too. Sure.

95
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,992
Sir?

96
00:06:42,003 --> 00:06:45,954
You know, that kind of computing power
doesn't really seem feasible...

97
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:49,881
Irwin, we're part of GloboTech.
We can find the technology.

98
00:06:50,095 --> 00:06:55,337
Our missiles can find a bastard 7,000 miles
away and stick a warhead up his ass.

99
00:06:55,475 --> 00:06:59,223
This won't be a problem. They're soldiers.
What do soldiers need?

100
00:06:59,855 --> 00:07:02,012
- Hats?
- Camouflage?

101
00:07:02,983 --> 00:07:04,145
Ms. Kegel?

102
00:07:04,318 --> 00:07:05,267
Enemies, sir.

103
00:07:05,361 --> 00:07:09,406
Enemies. See, these hideous,
ugly freaks are the enemy...

104
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:12,159
...and our guys have to find them
and vaporize them.

105
00:07:12,575 --> 00:07:15,327
No, they're not... Sir?

106
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,702
Don't you think that's a bit violent?

107
00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:21,708
Exactly. So call it action, not violence.

108
00:07:21,876 --> 00:07:24,166
Kids love action. It sells.

109
00:07:24,296 --> 00:07:28,127
Besides, what are you worried about?
They're only toys.

110
00:07:31,261 --> 00:07:35,508
I can't believe this. This is really wrong.

111
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,258
It's a total perversion of everything
I designed these Gorgonites to be!

112
00:07:39,353 --> 00:07:41,807
Can it, Irwin. This is a golden opportunity.

113
00:07:41,897 --> 00:07:44,849
If we pull this off,
Mars will be eating out of our hands.

114
00:07:44,941 --> 00:07:46,399
By the way, gentlemen...

115
00:07:46,485 --> 00:07:49,818
...Mr. Mars expects the product
ready for shipment in three months.

116
00:07:49,946 --> 00:07:51,145
Three months?

117
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,655
No. It takes at least six months.

118
00:07:54,826 --> 00:07:56,902
There's product testing and focus...

119
00:07:56,995 --> 00:08:00,079
Three months is fine.
Tell Mr. Mars they'll be ready then.

120
00:08:00,165 --> 00:08:01,540
All right, then.

121
00:08:02,126 --> 00:08:03,751
These are your security cards.

122
00:08:03,835 --> 00:08:07,702
They give you unlimited access
to all top-secret Globo technology.

123
00:08:07,964 --> 00:08:12,841
And these are your individual,
secret passwords. Memorize them now.

124
00:08:16,097 --> 00:08:17,425
Mine's "Gizmo."

125
00:08:17,682 --> 00:08:19,673
I said "secret."

126
00:08:26,691 --> 00:08:30,191
Password. Password.
What's my password?

127
00:08:35,533 --> 00:08:36,695
Gizmo.

128
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:42,413
Let's find us some chips.

129
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:48,286
Some really good chips.

130
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:52,457
A lot of really good chips.

131
00:08:58,221 --> 00:08:59,800
The X1000.

132
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:03,348
Hello, Mr. Chips.

133
00:11:10,145 --> 00:11:13,644
This looks like a nice store.
Look at those toys.

134
00:11:13,732 --> 00:11:17,066
Come on, Grandma.
This place never has anything good.

135
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:47,131
Hey, Alan.

136
00:11:49,391 --> 00:11:51,218
How's the world treating you?

137
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,264
- You, Joe, are the highlight of my day.
- Jeez, tough break, kid.

138
00:11:54,855 --> 00:11:57,856
- New truck?
- New owner. See?

139
00:12:01,028 --> 00:12:03,946
Soon everything will be owned
by one giant corporation.

140
00:12:04,281 --> 00:12:06,274
Then, it's good-bye microbreweries.

141
00:12:06,617 --> 00:12:08,694
So, where's your dad? I got his order.

142
00:12:08,786 --> 00:12:11,409
He's going out of town tonight
for a seminar.

143
00:12:11,748 --> 00:12:13,953
Wait a second. He left you in charge?

144
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,918
I was as surprised as you.

145
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:20,916
I think he's starting to trust me again.
Or maybe he didn't have a choice.

146
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:23,751
What's the seminar?

147
00:12:23,967 --> 00:12:26,969
"How to make a success
of your small business."

148
00:12:27,387 --> 00:12:29,179
I suggested torching the place.

149
00:12:29,264 --> 00:12:33,512
Not a good idea. Arson forensics
nowadays are very sophisticated.

150
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:41,016
"Gorgonites and Commando Elite."

151
00:12:42,443 --> 00:12:43,524
What are those?

152
00:12:45,781 --> 00:12:46,978
Let's find out.

153
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,662
Ten-hut!

154
00:12:58,836 --> 00:13:01,505
Major Chip Hazard, reporting for duty, sir!

155
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:05,540
Wow. Voice activated. Not bad.

156
00:13:06,427 --> 00:13:10,175
They move, they talk.
They got a built-in, two-way radio.

157
00:13:10,847 --> 00:13:14,098
"Buy a second commando
and communicate with a friend."

158
00:13:18,229 --> 00:13:19,973
Halt! Who goes there?

159
00:13:20,773 --> 00:13:24,190
Greetings. I am Archer,
emissary of the Gorgonites.

160
00:13:26,864 --> 00:13:28,822
Awfully polite for a monster.

161
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:32,318
You never have to replace the battery.
That's a good thing.

162
00:13:33,954 --> 00:13:37,620
Hey, Joe. Do you think you could
front me a set of these?

163
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:38,783
What?

164
00:13:39,168 --> 00:13:41,954
Sort of lend them to me.
You got plenty in the truck.

165
00:13:43,963 --> 00:13:46,170
That's Toy World's inventory
for the month.

166
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:48,131
This order's paid for.

167
00:13:48,218 --> 00:13:50,008
I'll pay you back after I sell them.

168
00:13:50,094 --> 00:13:52,301
What about your dad's policy, no war toys?

169
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:56,220
Don't worry about my dad.
By the time he gets back, they'll be sold.

170
00:13:56,309 --> 00:13:58,385
And we'll have made some money for once.

171
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,974
I don't know.

172
00:14:02,941 --> 00:14:05,099
You're saying that never in your career...

173
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,981
...has anything just fallen off
the back of the truck?

174
00:14:08,072 --> 00:14:10,064
I don't like your tone.

175
00:14:10,156 --> 00:14:10,939
Sorry.

176
00:14:11,324 --> 00:14:12,568
It's too loud.

177
00:14:14,494 --> 00:14:16,616
Okay, one whole set.

178
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,488
I'll lose the paperwork someplace.

179
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,874
- I had better not regret this.
- You won't. I swear.

180
00:14:23,003 --> 00:14:25,160
And you've got to get them off the truck.

181
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,881
<i>- I could get in trouble for this.
- No one will know.</i>

182
00:14:29,049 --> 00:14:32,669
<i>They better not. These toys don't go
on sale officially until Monday.</i>

183
00:14:32,763 --> 00:14:36,013
<i>I could loose my job.
I could loose my house.</i>

184
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:55,071
Thanks, Joe. I owe you one.

185
00:14:55,701 --> 00:14:57,160
You owe me twelve.

186
00:14:59,413 --> 00:15:00,992
Good luck, kid.

187
00:15:19,976 --> 00:15:21,470
Freeze!

188
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:46,456
I wanted to go to Toy World.

189
00:15:46,544 --> 00:15:49,414
Life is full of disappointments.
Go look around.

190
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,923
His birthday's next week.
Mom said I had to take him shopping.

191
00:15:54,218 --> 00:15:56,625
Great. What kind of stuff is he into?

192
00:15:57,512 --> 00:16:01,297
Dinosaurs, mutants.
Anything that maims, kills or destroys.

193
00:16:01,851 --> 00:16:03,049
I just got in...

194
00:16:03,143 --> 00:16:06,595
You're Alan Abernathy.
You moved into the house behind mine.

195
00:16:07,106 --> 00:16:08,683
I've heard about you.

196
00:16:08,856 --> 00:16:10,482
- You have?
- Yeah.

197
00:16:11,777 --> 00:16:14,149
How come I never see you after school?

198
00:16:14,988 --> 00:16:16,482
I'm kind of stuck here.

199
00:16:16,782 --> 00:16:18,573
What kind of toy store is this?

200
00:16:19,076 --> 00:16:21,863
It's my dad. He thinks these toys are cool.

201
00:16:22,412 --> 00:16:24,238
Too bad nobody else does.

202
00:16:25,374 --> 00:16:28,577
The Commando Elite will rid the Earth
of the Gorgonites.

203
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,337
The Gorgonites are peaceful.
We mean no harm.

204
00:16:32,757 --> 00:16:36,504
Gorgonite, you are a hideous freak.
You will be vaporized.

205
00:16:37,719 --> 00:16:40,674
Civilian, declare your allegiance.

206
00:16:42,391 --> 00:16:43,387
Cool.

207
00:16:44,059 --> 00:16:46,016
I know what I want!

208
00:16:46,104 --> 00:16:51,098
I want the soldier! They're walking
and fighting and they're so cool!

209
00:16:53,569 --> 00:16:54,647
Where'd they go?

210
00:16:57,448 --> 00:16:59,071
What about this one?

211
00:16:59,158 --> 00:17:01,149
No, I want the other one.

212
00:17:01,493 --> 00:17:03,948
Major Chip Hazard. He's the one.

213
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:05,905
- How much are these?
- A lot.

214
00:17:05,998 --> 00:17:08,239
Mom and Dad won't buy you one of these.

215
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:11,703
Yes, they will.
They buy you those stupid Gwendy dolls.

216
00:17:12,045 --> 00:17:13,752
All right, Timmy.

217
00:17:15,632 --> 00:17:17,625
Save me one of the buff guys.

218
00:17:17,717 --> 00:17:20,209
- And a monster, too.
- I don't think so, brat.

219
00:17:20,303 --> 00:17:23,887
- I'll find it and hold it till tomorrow.
- How about the flame-thrower?

220
00:17:25,642 --> 00:17:29,473
- When will I get that toy?
- Never, if you don't shut up.

221
00:17:32,691 --> 00:17:34,517
Say "hi" once in a while.

222
00:17:58,007 --> 00:18:00,795
- Meet death with honor, coward.
- There you are.

223
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:11,259
Congratulations. You're practically sold.

224
00:18:13,064 --> 00:18:14,724
You, I'm not so sure about.

225
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:21,230
Troglokhan.

226
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,989
Punch-it.

227
00:18:31,206 --> 00:18:33,199
Oh, man! Dad's ticket!

228
00:18:37,505 --> 00:18:39,794
Okay, suitcase...

229
00:18:39,882 --> 00:18:42,718
...briefcase, keys. Keys.
Where are my keys?

230
00:18:42,926 --> 00:18:44,587
Right where you left them.

231
00:18:44,678 --> 00:18:46,504
And where did I leave them?

232
00:18:49,725 --> 00:18:52,180
What is wrong with me? What else?

233
00:18:52,311 --> 00:18:54,184
Stuart, please, try to relax.

234
00:18:54,271 --> 00:18:58,314
Remember why we moved here.
To get away from the stress.

235
00:18:58,775 --> 00:19:00,769
To eliminate the stress.

236
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,563
To...

237
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,606
...exhale...

238
00:19:05,408 --> 00:19:06,985
...the stress.

239
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,119
Mom! I know what I want for my birthday.
I want a Major Chip Hazard.

240
00:19:15,542 --> 00:19:17,998
- Don't upset your father.
- Hi, Dad.

241
00:19:18,087 --> 00:19:19,829
- Hi, sweetie.
- What's up?

242
00:19:19,963 --> 00:19:22,122
- AI here was just telling me...
- Ed.

243
00:19:22,257 --> 00:19:25,258
He was telling me the angle
of the Earth's tilt on its axis...

244
00:19:25,344 --> 00:19:28,298
...relative to the orbit
of the transmission satellite...

245
00:19:28,388 --> 00:19:31,804
...restricts the placement
for optimum reception.

246
00:19:32,685 --> 00:19:34,060
Yeah.

247
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:37,270
In other words, this tree is in the way.

248
00:19:37,689 --> 00:19:39,348
Right. Exactly.

249
00:19:40,484 --> 00:19:42,642
<i>No problema.</i>

250
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:51,738
Knock that off!

251
00:19:51,829 --> 00:19:55,742
Stuart, dish guy says the tree has to go.
You don't mind, do you?

252
00:19:55,874 --> 00:19:57,950
- Yes, I mind!
- What?

253
00:19:58,336 --> 00:20:02,996
I said, "yes, I mind!" What the hell
are you doing, Phil? This is my tree!

254
00:20:03,297 --> 00:20:08,588
Happy to do the work. What are neighbors
for? Isn't the dish a beauty?

255
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:11,845
No. This tree is beautiful.

256
00:20:12,182 --> 00:20:15,135
That dish is just one more piece
of techno-crap...

257
00:20:15,267 --> 00:20:18,387
...to go along with the rest
of your stockpile of techno-crap!

258
00:20:18,521 --> 00:20:22,306
You're already pulling so much juice,
you got us living in a cancer node.

259
00:20:22,443 --> 00:20:24,732
There's never been
any conclusive data linking...

260
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,363
Give me that saw, Phil.

261
00:20:26,446 --> 00:20:29,814
Stuart, come on.
Airplane now, vendetta later.

262
00:20:29,908 --> 00:20:33,988
I'll check the zoning laws,
but I think they'll prove me right.

263
00:20:41,002 --> 00:20:44,003
Hasn't he heard of the dishes
that go on top of your house?

264
00:20:44,089 --> 00:20:45,831
Maybe they don't get as many channels.

265
00:20:45,924 --> 00:20:47,382
He probably got a deal.

266
00:20:47,467 --> 00:20:48,083
Dad!

267
00:20:50,262 --> 00:20:52,587
Alan, you're supposed to be in the shop.

268
00:20:53,682 --> 00:20:54,962
You forgot your ticket.

269
00:20:55,557 --> 00:20:57,218
My ticket.

270
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:00,062
Thank you, son. Way to stay heads up.

271
00:21:00,187 --> 00:21:02,264
Occasionally I do something right.

272
00:21:02,356 --> 00:21:03,602
I'm out of here.

273
00:21:03,692 --> 00:21:06,776
- Hurry but drive carefully.
- I'll call you when I get there.

274
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,979
Give me a smooch.

275
00:21:09,947 --> 00:21:12,274
- Bye-bye. Bye, son.
- See you later, Dad.

276
00:21:28,591 --> 00:21:31,628
- The door was locked when you left?
- Yes.

277
00:21:31,761 --> 00:21:33,504
Did you empty the cash register?

278
00:21:33,595 --> 00:21:36,631
Both quarters and all six pennies.
And I shut off the lights.

279
00:21:36,723 --> 00:21:37,720
Just asking.

280
00:21:37,808 --> 00:21:41,391
It's possible I make it through
the entire day without screwing up.

281
00:22:06,046 --> 00:22:07,372
What the...

282
00:22:12,634 --> 00:22:14,793
How the heck did you get in here?

283
00:22:26,107 --> 00:22:29,606
What was it? Halt! Who goes there?

284
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:34,608
Greetings. I am Archer,
emissary of the Gorgonites.

285
00:22:35,449 --> 00:22:36,944
Sure you are.

286
00:22:38,077 --> 00:22:40,566
Beware. There will be no mercy.

287
00:22:40,703 --> 00:22:42,197
Is that so?

288
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:45,031
Beware. There will be no mercy.

289
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,329
I'll be real careful. Thanks for the advice.

290
00:22:51,923 --> 00:22:56,170
Greetings. I am Archer,
emissary of the Gorgonites.

291
00:22:56,679 --> 00:22:58,256
What is your name?

292
00:22:58,848 --> 00:23:02,014
I'm Alan. Now shut up.
I have to do my homework.

293
00:23:03,811 --> 00:23:05,802
Greetings, Alan-now-shut-up.

294
00:23:07,106 --> 00:23:08,516
What did you say?

295
00:23:11,068 --> 00:23:13,025
You just said my name, didn't you?

296
00:23:17,409 --> 00:23:18,651
Didn't you?

297
00:24:18,927 --> 00:24:21,169
Commandos! Ten-hut!

298
00:24:23,764 --> 00:24:25,923
Commando Elite, fall in!

299
00:24:40,782 --> 00:24:42,276
Sound off, soldiers!

300
00:24:42,367 --> 00:24:45,616
Butch Meathook, sniper.
Lethal from any distance, sir!

301
00:24:45,745 --> 00:24:47,121
Good to have you aboard.

302
00:24:47,205 --> 00:24:50,240
Nick Nitro. Demolition is my mission.

303
00:24:50,332 --> 00:24:52,491
I served with your father.
He was a good man.

304
00:24:52,585 --> 00:24:56,085
Brick Bazooka, artillery.
Ready to go full bore, sir!

305
00:24:56,172 --> 00:24:57,452
Save it for the enemy.

306
00:24:57,549 --> 00:25:01,381
Link Static, communications.
Awaiting orders, sir!

307
00:25:01,468 --> 00:25:03,710
Double up on your rations, Sparky.

308
00:25:03,804 --> 00:25:07,885
Kip Killagin, covert insurgent.
Sharp as a razor, sir!

309
00:25:08,018 --> 00:25:10,057
Let me see that weapon.

310
00:25:11,895 --> 00:25:14,221
Standard issue is insufficient.

311
00:25:14,315 --> 00:25:16,805
All right, ladies, now listen good.

312
00:25:17,025 --> 00:25:20,690
Our mission:
Destroy the Gorgonite enemy. Defeat him!

313
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,109
Yes, sir!

314
00:25:22,364 --> 00:25:24,856
There will be no mercy.

315
00:25:25,326 --> 00:25:29,786
Search the area and secure new arms.
Commandos, fall out!

316
00:26:45,865 --> 00:26:47,903
Gorgon.

317
00:27:14,434 --> 00:27:16,177
What the heck are you?

318
00:27:20,148 --> 00:27:22,639
You're not like any toy I've ever seen.

319
00:27:24,194 --> 00:27:26,269
Come on, speak up.

320
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:33,236
Greetings, Alan-now-shut-up.
I am Archer, emissary of the Gorgonites.

321
00:27:34,287 --> 00:27:36,695
I think you're smarter
than you're letting on.

322
00:27:37,123 --> 00:27:41,998
I bet you're smart enough to get my name
right. It's Alan. Just Alan. Got it?

323
00:27:43,545 --> 00:27:45,207
Greetings, Alan.

324
00:27:45,424 --> 00:27:48,423
I knew it. Walk to the end of the table.

325
00:27:51,637 --> 00:27:53,012
Don't play dumb with me.

326
00:27:53,139 --> 00:27:54,882
You know what I'm saying.

327
00:28:08,946 --> 00:28:10,939
Alan, friend of Archer.

328
00:28:11,115 --> 00:28:14,698
Defender of all Gorgonites.
Keeper of Encarta.

329
00:28:15,161 --> 00:28:17,153
Keeper of Encarta?

330
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:21,074
You were using my computer?

331
00:28:22,085 --> 00:28:25,085
If I find a virus in there,
you're headed for the microwave.

332
00:28:26,089 --> 00:28:28,759
Beware. There will be no mercy.

333
00:28:30,383 --> 00:28:31,843
Are you threatening me?

334
00:28:31,927 --> 00:28:36,256
The Gorgonites must be free.
There will be no mercy.

335
00:28:43,189 --> 00:28:48,313
Soldiers, no poor sap ever won a war
by dying for his country.

336
00:28:48,402 --> 00:28:51,568
He won it by being all that he can be.

337
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:55,364
Damn the torpedoes or give me death!

338
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:58,700
Eternal vigilance is the price of duty.

339
00:28:58,787 --> 00:29:02,785
And to the victors go the spoils.
So, remember...

340
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:06,659
...you are the best of the best
of the few and the proud!

341
00:29:06,795 --> 00:29:09,204
So, ask not what your country
can do for you...

342
00:29:09,297 --> 00:29:12,464
...only regret that you have
but one life to live.

343
00:29:13,135 --> 00:29:16,135
The war against the Gorgonites
will be won!

344
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:21,556
Commando Elite, let the first shot be fired!

345
00:29:21,643 --> 00:29:24,846
Search out the Gorgonites
and frag them all!

346
00:29:24,939 --> 00:29:26,729
Attack!

347
00:29:27,983 --> 00:29:29,477
<i>Get him! Jump on him!</i>

348
00:29:29,568 --> 00:29:31,561
<i>Plastic at twelve o'clock!</i>

349
00:29:35,824 --> 00:29:38,493
<i>Archer, where are you, anyway?</i>

350
00:29:42,665 --> 00:29:45,416
I am in so much trouble.

351
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:48,457
There will be no mercy.

352
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:52,797
This is what you meant?

353
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,083
How could toys do this?

354
00:30:02,141 --> 00:30:04,300
Alas, poor Troglokhan.

355
00:30:04,394 --> 00:30:08,392
I'm sorry, Archer.
That's all the pieces I could find.

356
00:30:09,524 --> 00:30:12,809
The Commando Elite
have destroyed Troglokhan.

357
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:16,812
What about the other Gorgonites?
And where are the Commandos?

358
00:30:25,165 --> 00:30:28,415
Hi. We're closed. See the sign?

359
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:31,544
I'll be quick. I just came for Major Chip
and the monster.

360
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,503
I can't sell you them. Sorry.

361
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:36,212
But you're the only store that has them.

362
00:30:36,302 --> 00:30:37,961
The toys are gone, all right?

363
00:30:38,595 --> 00:30:40,219
Well, what about him?

364
00:30:42,556 --> 00:30:45,558
Him. He's defective...

365
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:49,135
...and the rest were stolen.

366
00:30:49,272 --> 00:30:50,932
That's too bad.

367
00:30:53,485 --> 00:30:54,647
Alan...

368
00:30:54,777 --> 00:30:56,437
...we must find the...

369
00:30:57,946 --> 00:30:59,821
Oh, my God.

370
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:03,153
Who did this?

371
00:31:06,915 --> 00:31:09,203
Are you pulling
some kind of insurance scam?

372
00:31:10,418 --> 00:31:14,913
I swear, I did one thing wrong.
That's it! And I'm branded for life.

373
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:17,166
So, it is true.

374
00:31:18,218 --> 00:31:22,594
I heard your parents moved here because
you got kicked out of ten different schools.

375
00:31:22,722 --> 00:31:24,001
I did not.

376
00:31:24,306 --> 00:31:25,717
No?

377
00:31:32,689 --> 00:31:33,934
It was two.

378
00:31:34,066 --> 00:31:35,561
Only two.

379
00:31:41,658 --> 00:31:42,820
So...

380
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,819
...you need some help?

381
00:31:47,537 --> 00:31:50,409
- Alan, can I talk now?
- No.

382
00:31:53,169 --> 00:31:55,742
I can't believe they broke my dad's radio.

383
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:00,670
<i>Do you ever watch that show,
Family of Five?</i>

384
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:01,956
Sure.

385
00:32:02,052 --> 00:32:03,381
You like it?

386
00:32:03,971 --> 00:32:04,966
It's okay.

387
00:32:05,055 --> 00:32:08,260
Thank God! Me, neither.
I hate it. It's so lame.

388
00:32:08,351 --> 00:32:10,094
I'm sick of hearing it's so great.

389
00:32:10,186 --> 00:32:12,427
I can't stand the parents. They're so nice.

390
00:32:12,522 --> 00:32:16,056
- The worst. Where do these go?
- Over there.

391
00:32:18,318 --> 00:32:21,155
<i>I'm more of an X-Files guy myself.</i>

392
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:23,688
"The truth is out there," Alan.

393
00:32:25,659 --> 00:32:27,117
You like Led Zeppelin?

394
00:32:27,203 --> 00:32:29,361
Yeah, they're the greatest.

395
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:31,824
They're my favorite band.

396
00:32:33,292 --> 00:32:36,044
You're not like other girls.

397
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:38,080
I know.

398
00:32:45,637 --> 00:32:49,303
I can't believe we've finished.
It took less time than I thought.

399
00:32:50,142 --> 00:32:51,968
And the boat looks great.

400
00:32:52,184 --> 00:32:55,103
It wasn't that messed up.
The mast was the hardest part.

401
00:32:55,188 --> 00:32:56,682
He'll never know.

402
00:32:58,483 --> 00:33:00,808
So, what did you do?

403
00:33:03,071 --> 00:33:06,274
Come on, Alan.
I've heard the story ten times already.

404
00:33:06,407 --> 00:33:09,160
Don't deny it. They say
you're a real terror.

405
00:33:09,452 --> 00:33:12,121
Yeah, that's me, a real terror.

406
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:16,372
I did some graffiti, flooded
the faculty bathroom. Stuff like that.

407
00:33:16,586 --> 00:33:19,419
My shrink told my parents
I was "acting out."

408
00:33:20,005 --> 00:33:22,674
I heard you called a bomb scare
on Parents' Day.

409
00:33:22,757 --> 00:33:24,797
That's when I got caught.

410
00:33:24,884 --> 00:33:26,214
Bummer.

411
00:33:26,803 --> 00:33:28,547
I got put on probation for a while.

412
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:31,924
But that was a long time ago.
I'm a totally different person now.

413
00:33:32,684 --> 00:33:33,679
Sure.

414
00:33:33,852 --> 00:33:35,180
No, really.

415
00:33:35,352 --> 00:33:36,931
Hey, Alan, how's it going?

416
00:33:38,815 --> 00:33:39,810
Dad.

417
00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:43,482
I was on my way home from the airport.
I thought I'd stop to say hello.

418
00:33:44,069 --> 00:33:46,643
- And check up on me?
- And check up on you.

419
00:33:47,073 --> 00:33:49,908
Of course. That's my job.
Me Dad, you son, right?

420
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:53,199
- This is Christy.
- Hi.

421
00:33:53,288 --> 00:33:55,447
- From next door.
- Hello.

422
00:33:56,374 --> 00:33:59,044
- Alan, what happened here?
- Nothing.

423
00:34:00,128 --> 00:34:01,787
Nothing happened.

424
00:34:03,048 --> 00:34:04,375
Really?

425
00:34:06,885 --> 00:34:09,126
Then, how do you explain this?

426
00:34:09,304 --> 00:34:11,795
I was dusting it and it fell over.

427
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:14,641
Dusting with what, a croquet mallet?

428
00:34:15,894 --> 00:34:17,519
I should go.

429
00:34:17,603 --> 00:34:19,845
I almost forgot my stuff.

430
00:34:23,734 --> 00:34:25,477
Bye, Alan.

431
00:34:28,782 --> 00:34:30,774
You go home, too. I'll close up.

432
00:34:30,992 --> 00:34:34,860
- I can do it.
- Obviously you can't. Go home.

433
00:34:48,217 --> 00:34:50,257
I'm really sorry about that.

434
00:34:50,344 --> 00:34:54,258
I have parents, too.
If that's all he sees, you got off lucky.

435
00:34:54,766 --> 00:34:56,924
- Here are your toys.
- Thanks.

436
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:02,472
What happened? I thought
you were coming by practice today.

437
00:35:02,564 --> 00:35:04,889
Sorry. Something else came up.

438
00:35:05,275 --> 00:35:08,809
I know you. You're the kid
who set his old school on fire, right?

439
00:35:09,112 --> 00:35:11,105
Yeah, just to watch it burn.

440
00:35:11,532 --> 00:35:12,695
Whatever.

441
00:35:13,117 --> 00:35:16,949
We got a scrimmage with the JV.
Come on, you can cheer me on.

442
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,784
Great.

443
00:35:25,296 --> 00:35:26,790
See you later.

444
00:35:30,968 --> 00:35:32,213
Let's see...

445
00:35:35,138 --> 00:35:36,633
What do I need?

446
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,683
Coping saw.

447
00:35:46,399 --> 00:35:48,273
I don't believe it!

448
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:59,912
- Alan, we must...
- Shut up!

449
00:36:00,206 --> 00:36:02,910
- The Gorgonites...
- You're nothing but trouble.

450
00:36:16,138 --> 00:36:17,965
Link Static to command post.

451
00:36:18,056 --> 00:36:22,054
Have targeted single Gorgonite
with civilian escort.

452
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:24,843
Approaching your position. Over.

453
00:36:25,646 --> 00:36:28,139
Roger, Private Static. Copy that.

454
00:36:29,026 --> 00:36:31,184
Brick Bazooka, front and center.

455
00:36:31,819 --> 00:36:33,811
Prepare for assault, Sergeant.

456
00:36:36,699 --> 00:36:39,535
Don't fire till you see
the whites of his eyes.

457
00:36:40,537 --> 00:36:42,529
Prepare to fire the bazooka.

458
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,495
Fire!

459
00:37:02,266 --> 00:37:03,726
Gorgonite K9 corps.

460
00:37:09,149 --> 00:37:11,354
Watch it. I'll have your dog tags.

461
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:16,279
What are you doing here?

462
00:37:18,575 --> 00:37:19,738
Go home.

463
00:37:26,624 --> 00:37:28,782
Coming up.

464
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,788
Hand over hand.

465
00:37:34,298 --> 00:37:36,671
I'm coming for you, Gorgonite.

466
00:38:02,827 --> 00:38:04,486
Damn potholes.

467
00:38:05,663 --> 00:38:07,988
<i>Command post to Brick Bazooka. Report.</i>

468
00:38:10,125 --> 00:38:12,997
<i>Repeat, this is command post. Report.</i>

469
00:38:14,005 --> 00:38:16,673
Brick Bazooka reporting.

470
00:38:17,508 --> 00:38:21,838
Target escaped
en route to enemy stronghold.

471
00:38:22,554 --> 00:38:24,463
I'm pretty messed up, sir.

472
00:38:25,015 --> 00:38:27,851
<i>Hold on, son. We're on our way.</i>

473
00:38:29,979 --> 00:38:31,010
Wrong gauge.

474
00:38:31,104 --> 00:38:33,263
Insert tab A into slot B.

475
00:38:33,524 --> 00:38:35,350
Turn until click.

476
00:38:35,693 --> 00:38:37,981
Bite the bullet, pal. It'll be okay.

477
00:38:38,154 --> 00:38:39,482
Here's the tape.

478
00:38:41,741 --> 00:38:44,408
Go ahead, kid. Let it out.

479
00:38:52,168 --> 00:38:54,658
It's a small world after all.

480
00:38:58,675 --> 00:39:02,008
Hello, Heartland Play Systems.
How may I help you?

481
00:39:02,219 --> 00:39:05,718
Yes, I'm having some trouble
with one of your...

482
00:39:05,806 --> 00:39:08,723
What is the name of the toy
and the nature of the problem?

483
00:39:08,976 --> 00:39:11,265
The toys are the Gorgonites.

484
00:39:11,603 --> 00:39:13,561
There are no more Gorgonites.

485
00:39:14,188 --> 00:39:15,600
And the Commando Elite.

486
00:39:15,691 --> 00:39:18,264
They are the mortal enemies
of the Gorgonites.

487
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,737
<i>And what is the problem?</i>

488
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:23,236
The Commandos wrecked my dad's store
and destroyed the Gorgonites!

489
00:39:23,573 --> 00:39:26,243
The Commando Elite are designed
to fight the Gorgonites.

490
00:39:26,326 --> 00:39:28,948
No, they destroyed them
and now they're gone!

491
00:39:29,245 --> 00:39:32,579
<i>I'm sorry, but Heartland Play Systems
does not replace lost toys.</i>

492
00:39:32,708 --> 00:39:35,377
I didn't lose them!
Is there a machine I can talk to?

493
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,203
Just transfer me to a machine!

494
00:39:38,088 --> 00:39:39,997
Have a nice day, ma'am.

495
00:39:40,089 --> 00:39:41,465
I'm not a ma'am!

496
00:39:42,968 --> 00:39:46,717
<i>Please state the name of your toy
and nature of your problem.</i>

497
00:39:46,805 --> 00:39:49,509
Your damn Commando Elite
wrecked my dad's store...

498
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,514
...destroyed the super Gorgonites
and ran off! Got it? Lawsuit! Got that?

499
00:39:55,814 --> 00:39:59,811
Alan Abernathy, 330-555-0125.

500
00:40:01,403 --> 00:40:02,980
Destroy Gorgonites.

501
00:40:03,154 --> 00:40:04,150
Shut up!

502
00:40:11,288 --> 00:40:11,952
Alan.

503
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:13,449
Don't talk to me!

504
00:40:16,167 --> 00:40:17,496
Not a word!

505
00:40:26,886 --> 00:40:29,092
<i>On Monday morning, at 0900 hours...</i>

506
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:34,387
<i>...250,000 Commandos and 250,000
Gorgonites will fight side by side...</i>

507
00:40:34,477 --> 00:40:37,811
<i>...with children everywhere,
trying to separate mommy and daddy...</i>

508
00:40:37,897 --> 00:40:40,103
<i>...from the money in their wallets.</i>

509
00:40:42,734 --> 00:40:44,063
Larry.

510
00:40:46,698 --> 00:40:48,358
<i>Now, listen to this.</i>

511
00:40:48,449 --> 00:40:52,529
<i>They cover 100 merchandise licensees
for the next two months.</i>

512
00:40:52,662 --> 00:40:55,283
<i>You won't be able to turn on a TV,
board a bus...</i>

513
00:40:55,373 --> 00:40:57,947
<i>...open a lunch box,
or put on your own underwear...</i>

514
00:40:58,042 --> 00:41:01,542
<i>...without seeing the Gorgonites
raging war with the Commando Elite!</i>

515
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,547
<i>What do you think of that, Mr. Mars?</i>

516
00:41:07,217 --> 00:41:08,498
It's a start.

517
00:41:10,347 --> 00:41:11,424
Larry.

518
00:41:12,807 --> 00:41:14,466
<i>Larry, folks.</i>

519
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,768
We have to talk.

520
00:41:23,025 --> 00:41:25,065
We have a big problem. It's urgent.

521
00:41:25,152 --> 00:41:27,358
What are you doing here? Stop it.

522
00:41:30,408 --> 00:41:33,741
<i>Alan Abernathy, 330-555-0...</i>

523
00:41:34,871 --> 00:41:36,578
That's where voice mail cut him off.

524
00:41:36,663 --> 00:41:38,620
- It's not a problem.
- It's not?

525
00:41:38,707 --> 00:41:43,002
These things go on sale Monday.
How did this kid get hold of them?

526
00:41:43,129 --> 00:41:47,126
It's industrial espionage.
I got two words for you: Counter suit.

527
00:41:47,508 --> 00:41:49,915
One word: Countersuit. Two words.

528
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:52,169
It's two words, Larry!

529
00:41:52,763 --> 00:41:54,756
What if this kid's telling the truth?

530
00:41:54,848 --> 00:41:58,133
We can't have toys out on the market
that may be dangerous.

531
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:01,227
How can they be dangerous?
Everything on them is standard.

532
00:42:01,312 --> 00:42:04,230
The design is standard,
the materials are standard...

533
00:42:04,316 --> 00:42:06,642
...the mechanicals are standard.
Even the...

534
00:42:06,944 --> 00:42:07,975
Oh.

535
00:42:08,487 --> 00:42:09,686
What's, "Oh"?

536
00:42:09,906 --> 00:42:10,605
What?

537
00:42:10,698 --> 00:42:13,069
- You just said, "Oh."
- No, I said, "Oh."

538
00:42:13,158 --> 00:42:15,910
"Oh" like, "That's interesting"
or like, "We're screwed"?

539
00:42:15,994 --> 00:42:18,237
No. I mean, hey, whoa, oh.

540
00:42:19,205 --> 00:42:22,493
Forget the "Oh". I'll go to legal
to start on the countersuit.

541
00:42:22,584 --> 00:42:24,161
The chips!

542
00:42:24,836 --> 00:42:26,414
That's the "Oh."

543
00:42:27,297 --> 00:42:29,125
These microprocessing chips.

544
00:42:29,216 --> 00:42:32,003
What do they do
and where did you get them from?

545
00:42:32,093 --> 00:42:36,506
They microprocess. And they come from
the land of I Saved Your Job.

546
00:42:43,104 --> 00:42:45,774
They were designed
for the Defense Department.

547
00:42:46,526 --> 00:42:49,359
You put munitions chips in toys?

548
00:42:57,661 --> 00:42:59,571
<i>Archer...</i>

549
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:04,824
<i>...emissary of the Gorgonites.</i>

550
00:43:06,169 --> 00:43:08,044
<i>Where are you?</i>

551
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:13,583
<i>Beware. There will be no mercy.</i>

552
00:43:16,221 --> 00:43:19,222
<i>We're lost. We need to find our homeland.</i>

553
00:43:19,473 --> 00:43:20,803
<i>Yeah, our homeland.</i>

554
00:43:24,061 --> 00:43:26,599
<i>We're in trouble. Please find us.</i>

555
00:43:27,357 --> 00:43:29,479
<i>You've got to help us find Goron.</i>

556
00:43:29,568 --> 00:43:30,516
<i>Goron?</i>

557
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:32,401
<i>It's "Gorgon", moron.</i>

558
00:43:36,866 --> 00:43:41,079
<i>I hope he comes. We're no match
for the awesome Commandos.</i>

559
00:43:41,162 --> 00:43:43,403
<i>Yeah, everything else is just a toy.</i>

560
00:43:44,875 --> 00:43:47,448
<i>Kitty, kitty, kitty.</i>

561
00:43:53,341 --> 00:43:55,582
Grab him! Hold him down!

562
00:43:55,843 --> 00:43:57,587
Get that leg!

563
00:44:00,556 --> 00:44:02,216
String him up!

564
00:44:02,934 --> 00:44:04,892
<i>Tell us what we want to know.</i>

565
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:11,107
<i>I am Archer, emissary of the Gorgonites.</i>

566
00:44:11,234 --> 00:44:12,396
Archer?

567
00:44:13,611 --> 00:44:16,778
<i>Where are the rest of the Gorgonite scum?</i>

568
00:44:17,114 --> 00:44:19,785
<i>We have ways of making you talk.</i>

569
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:25,908
<i>Make it easy on yourself.
If you tell us, we'll let you go.</i>

570
00:44:25,999 --> 00:44:28,406
<i>It will go easier for you if you cooperate.</i>

571
00:44:29,126 --> 00:44:31,747
<i>I am Archer, emissary of the Gorgonites.</i>

572
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:34,837
<i>All right. Let's dispose of this garbage.</i>

573
00:44:38,594 --> 00:44:39,838
It's the kid.

574
00:44:39,928 --> 00:44:43,263
Commandos, pull back!
Retrograde movement!

575
00:45:00,324 --> 00:45:02,696
- Give me that!
- That's mine, punk!

576
00:45:04,745 --> 00:45:07,070
Surrender, Gorgonite ally.

577
00:45:08,415 --> 00:45:10,408
You just met your match.

578
00:45:10,793 --> 00:45:11,873
Oh, yeah?

579
00:45:11,961 --> 00:45:14,877
Surrender or die!

580
00:45:16,632 --> 00:45:18,375
Medic! Medic!

581
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:23,843
Medic!

582
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:27,473
Come on out!

583
00:45:28,727 --> 00:45:31,052
Alan, what the hell is going on here?

584
00:45:32,689 --> 00:45:33,555
Medic!

585
00:45:33,649 --> 00:45:35,724
Alan, your hand! What happened?

586
00:45:35,943 --> 00:45:39,395
How did you cut your hand?
And what are you doing down here?

587
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:43,033
Mom, Dad, it's okay.

588
00:45:45,952 --> 00:45:48,740
While you were gone,
I bought some soldier toys from Joe.

589
00:45:48,831 --> 00:45:51,204
I figured I could sell them
before you got back.

590
00:45:51,292 --> 00:45:54,207
And for once, I would have made
the store a little money.

591
00:45:54,294 --> 00:45:57,130
I know it was the wrong thing to do.
I'm sorry.

592
00:45:58,131 --> 00:45:59,791
There, I said it.

593
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:04,299
Okay.

594
00:46:05,306 --> 00:46:09,302
I think it's very honest of you
to tell the truth.

595
00:46:09,893 --> 00:46:14,306
So, you pawned my woodworking tools
so you could pay Joe?

596
00:46:14,398 --> 00:46:17,316
No! I'm pretty sure the toys took them.

597
00:46:17,568 --> 00:46:18,598
What?

598
00:46:18,944 --> 00:46:20,188
The toys.

599
00:46:21,656 --> 00:46:24,026
Are you trying to upset me?

600
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:27,283
I mean, are you deliberately making...

601
00:46:27,494 --> 00:46:30,577
- What was the word? Projected...
- Aggression.

602
00:46:30,663 --> 00:46:32,905
- Projected aggression...
- It's not aggression!

603
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:36,498
It's these toys!
It's like they're alive. Look.

604
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:40,830
Come on, Archer. Back me up here.

605
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:44,171
Say something.

606
00:46:45,094 --> 00:46:47,420
Halt! Who goes there? Talk to me!

607
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:49,672
Alan, please.

608
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:53,803
I need to ask you this. Are you on crank?

609
00:46:53,979 --> 00:46:54,808
No!

610
00:46:54,896 --> 00:46:58,726
Then is it crystal meth, tar, smack?
We need to know!

611
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:01,733
No, I'm not on drugs! It's these soldiers!

612
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:03,900
All right, that's it! Stop it.

613
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:06,197
I mean, Alan...

614
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:07,902
...I am...

615
00:47:09,202 --> 00:47:10,744
...at a loss.

616
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:17,793
You! Why didn't you say anything?

617
00:47:18,045 --> 00:47:21,579
<i>Shut up! Don't talk to me! Not a word!</i>

618
00:47:21,714 --> 00:47:24,383
Wise guy. I should shred the bunch of you.

619
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:28,426
My dad thinks I'm insane.
Christy thinks I'm an idiot...

620
00:47:28,513 --> 00:47:32,380
...and when Joe finds out
I can't pay him back, he'll break my legs.

621
00:47:32,893 --> 00:47:35,181
The Gorgonites are not destroyed.

622
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:36,885
What?

623
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:42,437
Major Hazard seeks the location of the
Gorgonite scum. They are not destroyed.

624
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:46,984
'Cause if the Commandos destroyed them
they wouldn't be looking for them.

625
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:51,232
All right, where are they?

626
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:55,195
My Gorgonite brothers are doing
what the Gorgonites do best:

627
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:57,074
They are hiding.

628
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:07,634
Commando Elite, fall in!

629
00:48:07,761 --> 00:48:09,753
Sir! Yes, sir!

630
00:48:11,264 --> 00:48:14,680
We have met the enemy.
He is big. He is fast.

631
00:48:14,767 --> 00:48:17,683
He has allied himself
with the Gorgonite scum.

632
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:22,183
The rules of engagement have changed.
Private Static!

633
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:24,688
Damn!

634
00:48:28,863 --> 00:48:30,855
This place is a gold mine.

635
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:34,201
Holy smokes. Look at all this hardware.

636
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:37,612
Technological superiority.

637
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:39,658
Dibs on the chain saw.

638
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:48,883
Falling in, sir.

639
00:48:53,807 --> 00:48:54,838
Out of the way.

640
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:02,847
It's only a flesh wound, sir.

641
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:06,020
Rest easy. You've done your job.

642
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:09,143
Did we win?

643
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:11,985
We will.

644
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:15,774
Nick Nitro's battery has run out.

645
00:49:15,993 --> 00:49:19,992
But his memory will keep going
and going and going.

646
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:23,001
His death will be avenged.

647
00:49:27,505 --> 00:49:30,957
Commandos, secure the perimeter!
Tap all communications!

648
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:34,212
Roll some armor! We got us a war to win.

649
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:37,304
If it launches, lacerates or detonates...

650
00:49:37,431 --> 00:49:40,005
...I want it mobile and I want it lethal!

651
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:41,560
Sir! Yes, sir!

652
00:49:48,526 --> 00:49:50,767
They're not in the storeroom,
they're not here.

653
00:49:50,861 --> 00:49:53,353
Monsters shouldn't be hiding
but fighting Commandos.

654
00:49:53,447 --> 00:49:54,776
We would lose.

655
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:57,523
It is what we were programmed to do.

656
00:49:57,619 --> 00:50:01,118
Hide and lose?
Those are some great options.

657
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:06,001
If I was a Gorgonite, where would I be?

658
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:11,287
I'm hiding because I'm a loser.
I've got zero self-esteem...

659
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:13,709
...and my brain's the size of a peanut.

660
00:50:14,801 --> 00:50:16,379
Where would I be?

661
00:50:32,069 --> 00:50:34,275
This is so gross.

662
00:50:34,572 --> 00:50:36,565
Hello. Is anybody in there?

663
00:50:42,621 --> 00:50:43,701
Ocula.

664
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:47,415
- What was that?
- It's the Gorgonites.

665
00:50:49,587 --> 00:50:50,916
Ocula.

666
00:50:52,091 --> 00:50:54,841
Punch-it. Scratch-it.

667
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:58,220
Great to be back.
But seriously, what a dump.

668
00:50:58,428 --> 00:50:59,757
Insaniac.

669
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:02,135
Are you a kid or oil painting?

670
00:51:03,936 --> 00:51:07,101
Don't worry, Archer. We was hiding.

671
00:51:07,604 --> 00:51:08,933
Slamfist.

672
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:12,020
Troglokhan?

673
00:51:14,278 --> 00:51:15,441
We fixed him.

674
00:51:15,529 --> 00:51:17,817
We tried to fix him.

675
00:51:19,032 --> 00:51:20,360
My dad's radio.

676
00:51:20,492 --> 00:51:23,529
Some assembly required.

677
00:51:24,872 --> 00:51:29,165
<i>So am I nuts? What's going on here?
Give me a call, 1-800, talk to me.</i>

678
00:51:29,293 --> 00:51:30,456
Freaky.

679
00:51:31,628 --> 00:51:33,122
Like Frankenstein.

680
00:51:34,881 --> 00:51:38,796
At least you're all here.
Maybe Joe won't break my legs after all.

681
00:51:39,636 --> 00:51:41,095
<i>Access approved.</i>

682
00:51:41,513 --> 00:51:43,008
Let me get this straight.

683
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:47,558
You used my password to order surplus
military chips that might be dangerous?

684
00:51:50,898 --> 00:51:52,558
It's okay.

685
00:51:52,649 --> 00:51:55,816
That's supposed to happen.
See? Clean room.

686
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,988
Clean. Let's just go in.

687
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:01,152
You okay?

688
00:52:02,535 --> 00:52:04,610
That's him. That's Ralph.

689
00:52:07,122 --> 00:52:08,996
Who are you? You don't belong here.

690
00:52:09,083 --> 00:52:12,451
I'm Larry Benson. You supplied
my division with some microchips.

691
00:52:12,545 --> 00:52:15,213
Yes. Larry Benson.

692
00:52:16,005 --> 00:52:21,000
The X1000. Worked out better
than you dreamed, didn't they?

693
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:24,127
Actually, there was a little problem.

694
00:52:25,307 --> 00:52:27,264
Then it's with your software.

695
00:52:27,684 --> 00:52:31,266
I don't think there's a problem
with the software, Ralph.

696
00:52:31,772 --> 00:52:32,887
You don't?

697
00:52:34,024 --> 00:52:37,144
The X1000 is a masterpiece.

698
00:52:38,445 --> 00:52:40,484
Imagine a microchip...

699
00:52:40,572 --> 00:52:44,783
...sophisticated enough to control
the guidance systems of ballistic missiles.

700
00:52:44,867 --> 00:52:48,996
Imagine it can be used to instantly upgrade
any system it's plugged into.

701
00:52:49,373 --> 00:52:54,367
Like a smart drug for machines.
Then, imagine it can learn.

702
00:52:55,044 --> 00:52:58,081
What are you talking about?
Artificial intelligence?

703
00:52:58,214 --> 00:53:00,207
No. Actual intelligence.

704
00:53:00,676 --> 00:53:03,877
No wonder those philistines
at the Pentagon didn't appreciate it.

705
00:53:03,969 --> 00:53:06,425
One flaw and they scrap the whole project.

706
00:53:07,266 --> 00:53:09,637
So there is a flaw in the chips.

707
00:53:11,645 --> 00:53:14,266
They're a little bit sensitive to EMP.

708
00:53:14,397 --> 00:53:17,600
EMP? Electromagnetic pulse?

709
00:53:17,733 --> 00:53:21,482
The kind generated
by the detonation of a nuclear device.

710
00:53:21,571 --> 00:53:24,940
I doubt even the toy industry has become
quite that competitive.

711
00:53:25,324 --> 00:53:29,653
They said, "Adequate shielding
wasn't cost effective."

712
00:53:31,331 --> 00:53:33,239
Did the Medici ever tell Michelangelo:

713
00:53:33,333 --> 00:53:37,793
"Sorry, Mike, marble's not cost-effective.
Here's a bag of cement"? I think not!

714
00:53:39,464 --> 00:53:40,627
<i>Gesundheit.</i>

715
00:53:41,091 --> 00:53:42,253
Thank you.

716
00:53:42,425 --> 00:53:45,628
There shouldn't be any problem,
just because the chips can learn.

717
00:53:45,844 --> 00:53:50,673
Am I not being clear? They learn within
the boundaries of their programming.

718
00:53:50,767 --> 00:53:54,350
Whatever the core programming,
the X1000 enhances it.

719
00:53:55,729 --> 00:53:58,564
So, if you have a problem,
it's in your software.

720
00:54:03,488 --> 00:54:06,655
Quick impression, Jimmy Cagney.
"Top of the world, Ma."

721
00:54:10,077 --> 00:54:12,236
Talk about hampering your career.

722
00:54:12,955 --> 00:54:14,153
Grab him!

723
00:54:14,791 --> 00:54:17,460
It looks so real, don't it?

724
00:54:18,795 --> 00:54:20,123
Hit him.

725
00:54:22,214 --> 00:54:23,792
Friend of yours?

726
00:54:30,639 --> 00:54:32,882
What am I going to do with you guys?

727
00:54:34,142 --> 00:54:36,930
Two hundred and twenty-one.
Two hundred and twenty-two.

728
00:54:37,981 --> 00:54:39,771
There goes the record.

729
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:47,936
Not so close. You'll ruin your eye.

730
00:54:56,916 --> 00:54:57,996
What are you looking at?

731
00:54:58,834 --> 00:55:00,162
I dunno.

732
00:55:05,298 --> 00:55:06,793
<i>- Hello?
- Alan?</i>

733
00:55:07,135 --> 00:55:07,915
Christy?

734
00:55:08,928 --> 00:55:10,505
Are you grounded?

735
00:55:10,596 --> 00:55:12,754
<i>No, my dad cooled off.</i>

736
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:14,170
So, we did it.

737
00:55:14,516 --> 00:55:18,513
Yeah, and the best part is,
I found all those lost toys.

738
00:55:19,188 --> 00:55:20,516
You were really a big help.

739
00:55:21,105 --> 00:55:22,435
Cool.

740
00:55:24,486 --> 00:55:26,109
So, Alan, boxers or briefs?

741
00:55:26,194 --> 00:55:27,902
Get those off your head.

742
00:55:28,197 --> 00:55:29,856
<i>Hey, what's going on?</i>

743
00:55:30,866 --> 00:55:32,028
Nothing.

744
00:55:33,534 --> 00:55:36,620
Listen, I was thinking maybe
we should celebrate sometime.

745
00:55:36,705 --> 00:55:38,863
Go to a movie or something.

746
00:55:39,123 --> 00:55:43,620
Alan, I only date older guys.
It's nothing personal.

747
00:55:46,465 --> 00:55:49,880
<i>What I mean is,
officially I'm going out with Brad.</i>

748
00:55:49,969 --> 00:55:53,633
What about unofficially? Or superficially?

749
00:55:54,305 --> 00:55:59,300
<i>There is one guy. But he's kind of
a smart aleck and a bit of a troublemaker.</i>

750
00:56:01,021 --> 00:56:04,022
<i>I'm sure he'd be willing
to give it all up for you.</i>

751
00:56:04,399 --> 00:56:06,225
<i>I know I would.</i>

752
00:56:07,069 --> 00:56:08,229
<i>Alan.</i>

753
00:56:16,788 --> 00:56:18,494
It's party time!

754
00:56:26,671 --> 00:56:28,498
One phat ride!

755
00:56:32,093 --> 00:56:37,218
Transmission intercepted. The Gorgonites
are bivouacked at the enemy stronghold.

756
00:56:37,348 --> 00:56:40,468
And the enemy has revealed
an age-old weakness.

757
00:56:40,561 --> 00:56:44,344
<i>I'm sure he'd be willing to give it all up
for you. I know I would.</i>

758
00:56:44,438 --> 00:56:46,645
Put yourself in for a commendation.

759
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:50,392
Soldiers! We have
a window of opportunity.

760
00:56:50,486 --> 00:56:54,069
We will exploit it, drown the enemy out
and crush the Gorgonites!

761
00:56:54,615 --> 00:56:59,277
We must go behind enemy lines
to secure a hostage. Prepare to move out.

762
00:56:59,871 --> 00:57:01,745
Hop it, jarheads!

763
00:57:05,626 --> 00:57:08,960
I guess you guys are safe
as long as you stay here.

764
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:13,716
What are you looking for?

765
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:14,964
Gorgon.

766
00:57:16,179 --> 00:57:18,136
This is a national park.

767
00:57:18,222 --> 00:57:21,224
The Isle of Gorgon is our homeland.

768
00:57:21,476 --> 00:57:23,633
Will you help us find it?

769
00:57:24,143 --> 00:57:26,386
I don't think you will find it in there.

770
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,559
Alan...

771
00:57:27,815 --> 00:57:31,647
...if Gorgon is not in that window,
is it in this one?

772
00:57:34,447 --> 00:57:36,522
There's nothing in windows.

773
00:57:36,741 --> 00:57:39,906
There's stuff outside them.

774
00:57:40,494 --> 00:57:41,656
What stuff?

775
00:57:41,912 --> 00:57:43,372
You know, outside.

776
00:57:43,497 --> 00:57:45,823
Trees, power poles...

777
00:57:47,251 --> 00:57:48,912
...Christy's house.

778
00:57:49,169 --> 00:57:50,829
And beyond that?

779
00:57:52,006 --> 00:57:53,547
The mall.

780
00:57:54,007 --> 00:57:55,668
And beyond that?

781
00:57:55,843 --> 00:57:57,171
The highway.

782
00:57:57,803 --> 00:57:59,131
And beyond that?

783
00:58:00,014 --> 00:58:02,171
About a million acres of farm.

784
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:04,808
And what's beyond that?

785
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:08,349
I don't know.

786
00:58:11,443 --> 00:58:12,853
Gorgon.

787
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:19,271
Live, via satellite, 257 channels.

788
00:58:19,366 --> 00:58:21,655
Closed captioning
for the hearing impaired...

789
00:58:21,744 --> 00:58:26,240
...and Dolby stereo where available,
which is right here, right now!

790
00:58:27,875 --> 00:58:31,208
What a great picture. It's perfect.

791
00:58:31,503 --> 00:58:34,207
I don't know. It looks kind of fuzzy.

792
00:58:36,467 --> 00:58:38,258
Let me try something else.

793
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,671
Oh, for pete's sake! Phil!

794
00:58:45,809 --> 00:58:48,347
Maybe if I tweak the brightness a little.

795
00:58:48,562 --> 00:58:52,394
No, it's the chroma.
The flesh tone's way off.

796
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:55,728
Now it's green.

797
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:57,189
Stand down, men.

798
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:00,027
We must neutralize these civilians.

799
00:59:00,115 --> 00:59:01,823
I paid a lot. I don't want any ghosts.

800
00:59:14,797 --> 00:59:15,911
Follow me.

801
00:59:20,218 --> 00:59:21,676
It's a trap, sir.

802
00:59:23,138 --> 00:59:24,217
Bring it here, soldier.

803
00:59:26,515 --> 00:59:27,925
Chemical warfare.

804
00:59:29,269 --> 00:59:31,060
Operation Sandman.

805
00:59:37,193 --> 00:59:39,020
Fire when ready, Private.

806
00:59:43,616 --> 00:59:46,783
Audie Murphy.
Our most decorated war hero.

807
00:59:52,082 --> 00:59:54,573
I think World War II was my favorite war.

808
01:00:00,049 --> 01:00:02,883
No sign of the target, sir. Area is secured.

809
01:00:03,010 --> 01:00:04,919
Don't worry. She'll be here.

810
01:00:15,022 --> 01:00:16,814
This is where we'll engage the target.

811
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:19,817
Set up concealed positions
and prepare for ambush.

812
01:00:20,236 --> 01:00:21,481
Oh, man.

813
01:00:21,947 --> 01:00:24,484
I can't believe they got me the whole set.

814
01:00:25,158 --> 01:00:26,782
Hold your fire, men.

815
01:00:26,866 --> 01:00:30,450
Cool, you can talk.
You must be the leader.

816
01:00:31,789 --> 01:00:34,707
Except one day, you get shot.

817
01:00:38,379 --> 01:00:41,380
And this guy gets promoted...

818
01:00:41,715 --> 01:00:44,384
...and now he's the leader. Yes!

819
01:00:44,593 --> 01:00:46,253
It wasn't my idea, Major.

820
01:00:46,386 --> 01:00:48,047
Commandos, attack!

821
01:00:48,430 --> 01:00:50,091
Pile on the kid!

822
01:00:58,983 --> 01:01:02,934
Son, you can be a prisoner or a casualty.
It's up to you.

823
01:01:03,029 --> 01:01:04,688
Sir, over here.

824
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:06,654
Oh, man, I hate babysitting.

825
01:01:06,741 --> 01:01:09,908
- What is it, soldier?
- Take a look, sir.

826
01:01:12,371 --> 01:01:14,660
Bombshells, sir.

827
01:01:17,667 --> 01:01:19,328
Fully posable.

828
01:01:22,005 --> 01:01:24,331
Hello, dolly!

829
01:01:27,344 --> 01:01:29,172
Sweet stuff!

830
01:01:29,513 --> 01:01:30,923
Hubba-hubba.

831
01:01:32,557 --> 01:01:33,756
R and R, sir?

832
01:01:33,851 --> 01:01:35,974
Request a 3-day pass, sir.

833
01:01:36,102 --> 01:01:41,097
Denied. Gentlemen, this is the new army.
Those are reinforcements.

834
01:01:41,608 --> 01:01:44,941
Bring me the head of Nick Nitro. Move.

835
01:01:53,204 --> 01:01:55,873
Soldier, your memory will live on.

836
01:01:59,542 --> 01:02:00,538
Damn!

837
01:02:01,003 --> 01:02:01,999
Criminy!

838
01:02:02,253 --> 01:02:04,081
I think I'm gonna hurl.

839
01:02:07,008 --> 01:02:09,250
A mind is a terrible thing to waste.

840
01:03:06,818 --> 01:03:09,487
It's alive! It's alive!

841
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:17,069
Hi, there. Cannon Fodder Gwendy,
reporting for duty, sir.

842
01:03:17,870 --> 01:03:19,697
Carry on, soldier.

843
01:03:24,294 --> 01:03:26,583
I feel your pain.

844
01:03:48,859 --> 01:03:49,855
Alan...

845
01:03:50,903 --> 01:03:53,110
...the Commando Elite are in the trees.

846
01:03:54,031 --> 01:03:56,319
They're not moving
because of the Commandos.

847
01:03:56,409 --> 01:03:57,902
It's the wind.

848
01:03:58,745 --> 01:03:59,823
See?

849
01:04:00,162 --> 01:04:01,988
I see your hand.

850
01:04:02,289 --> 01:04:05,291
The wind is blowing. You can feel it.

851
01:04:06,043 --> 01:04:07,158
Feel?

852
01:04:07,628 --> 01:04:11,127
Right. Plastic. Sorry.

853
01:04:12,299 --> 01:04:15,134
It's kind of hard to describe.

854
01:04:15,469 --> 01:04:18,174
Weather patterns, wind chill factor.

855
01:04:19,556 --> 01:04:22,641
Just because you can't see it,
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

856
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,092
See?

857
01:04:29,191 --> 01:04:30,305
Wind.

858
01:04:34,821 --> 01:04:36,730
Mom? Dad? I'm home.

859
01:04:39,201 --> 01:04:40,481
They're asleep.

860
01:04:40,702 --> 01:04:44,036
- You know what that means?
- They could wake up any second.

861
01:04:44,833 --> 01:04:47,322
You know, you are such a major hottie.

862
01:04:48,167 --> 01:04:50,838
And you are such a major sweet talker.

863
01:04:51,297 --> 01:04:52,577
Good night.

864
01:05:10,065 --> 01:05:14,312
My bike won't start. I got nowhere to go.
Can I come in?

865
01:05:15,361 --> 01:05:16,820
No, that's not it.

866
01:05:46,268 --> 01:05:48,936
Don't hate me because I'm beautiful.

867
01:05:56,111 --> 01:05:57,818
Let's do something fun.

868
01:05:58,113 --> 01:05:59,737
We'll all get facials.

869
01:06:00,115 --> 01:06:02,273
Did I overpluck my eyebrows?

870
01:06:30,478 --> 01:06:32,803
Now it's our turn to play with you.

871
01:06:35,149 --> 01:06:36,941
Let's see if her head comes off.

872
01:06:42,823 --> 01:06:43,902
Christy?

873
01:06:54,336 --> 01:06:56,825
Look. A man. Alley-oop.

874
01:06:57,838 --> 01:07:00,329
Such nice broad shoulders.
Do you work out?

875
01:07:00,967 --> 01:07:02,758
What's your sign, big boy?

876
01:07:03,343 --> 01:07:05,634
Makeovers are such a blast.

877
01:07:06,931 --> 01:07:09,682
That haircut is so five minutes ago.

878
01:07:09,767 --> 01:07:11,426
Are you dumping me?

879
01:07:13,437 --> 01:07:14,434
Get off!

880
01:07:15,898 --> 01:07:17,441
You! Maggot!

881
01:07:17,942 --> 01:07:20,860
An officer and a gentleman
does not strike a lady.

882
01:07:43,384 --> 01:07:44,962
Are you scared?

883
01:07:45,218 --> 01:07:47,213
We're all scared.

884
01:07:48,930 --> 01:07:51,765
You'd have to be crazy not to be scared.

885
01:07:58,232 --> 01:07:59,431
What?

886
01:08:01,568 --> 01:08:02,896
What do you see?

887
01:08:06,157 --> 01:08:08,314
Ocula? Are you all right?

888
01:08:09,367 --> 01:08:11,324
Settle down. You'll be okay.

889
01:08:20,545 --> 01:08:22,253
"Surrender?"

890
01:08:24,592 --> 01:08:25,541
<i>Smile, girlie.</i>

891
01:08:25,635 --> 01:08:28,469
<i>"Alan, I'm safe. I have not been harmed."</i>

892
01:08:29,262 --> 01:08:30,128
Christy?

893
01:08:30,222 --> 01:08:34,089
<i>"I am making this statement of my
own free will and under no duress."</i>

894
01:08:34,184 --> 01:08:37,221
<i>- Yeah, right.
- Stick to the script. Read it as we wrote it.</i>

895
01:08:37,938 --> 01:08:39,349
<i>Make it snappy.</i>

896
01:08:39,441 --> 01:08:42,107
<i>"I will be released safely and unharmed...</i>

897
01:08:42,274 --> 01:08:44,945
<i>"...only if the following conditions are met:</i>

898
01:08:45,362 --> 01:08:48,031
<i>"One: Surrender the Gorgonite scum."</i>

899
01:08:49,701 --> 01:08:50,731
<i>That's it.</i>

900
01:08:50,825 --> 01:08:52,285
<i>Faster, or we stick you.</i>

901
01:08:52,369 --> 01:08:54,195
<i>Alan, you have to help.</i>

902
01:08:54,454 --> 01:08:56,411
<i>Zoom in. Get those tears.</i>

903
01:08:56,955 --> 01:08:58,285
What else is on?

904
01:09:04,213 --> 01:09:08,293
If Major Chip Hazard wants a war,
we'll give him a war.

905
01:09:10,303 --> 01:09:11,584
<i>Please, Alan, don't do this.</i>

906
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:13,803
<i>- We're afraid.
- We're your friends.</i>

907
01:09:14,141 --> 01:09:16,264
<i>- Have mercy.
- You are a traitor.</i>

908
01:09:16,352 --> 01:09:18,758
<i>Hi. Welcome to the big cardboard box.</i>

909
01:09:20,062 --> 01:09:22,601
<i>We'll never see Gorgon again.</i>

910
01:09:22,690 --> 01:09:25,810
<i>- Alan seemed so nice.
- Why would he do this to us?</i>

911
01:09:25,901 --> 01:09:28,109
<i>Three words, folks. Pu-ber-ty.</i>

912
01:09:33,243 --> 01:09:37,405
Enemy contact.
Advance with caution. Roll!

913
01:09:38,330 --> 01:09:39,327
Sorry, sir.

914
01:09:39,833 --> 01:09:43,498
<i>How could you betray us? We're free.</i>

915
01:09:44,921 --> 01:09:47,922
<i>- Have mercy.
- The Commandos will kill us.</i>

916
01:09:48,131 --> 01:09:52,462
Gentlemen, it looks like they blinked.
Advance and envelop.

917
01:09:52,679 --> 01:09:53,923
Sir! Yes, sir!

918
01:09:54,139 --> 01:09:57,306
<i>Alan, I'm feeling very insecure.</i>

919
01:09:57,849 --> 01:10:00,257
<i>I'm allergic to cardboard. Pass it on.</i>

920
01:10:10,113 --> 01:10:11,771
Are you ready, Archer?

921
01:10:12,490 --> 01:10:15,989
Alan, are you sure this is a good idea?

922
01:10:31,133 --> 01:10:32,296
<i>You traitor.</i>

923
01:10:32,426 --> 01:10:35,463
<i>- We must be free.
- I don't feel well.</i>

924
01:10:35,554 --> 01:10:38,389
<i>Alan, don't do it. You'll be guilt-ridden.</i>

925
01:11:04,207 --> 01:11:07,292
<i>My aunt was buried alive.
I'm very claustrophobic.</i>

926
01:11:07,461 --> 01:11:08,956
Rock and roll!

927
01:11:09,922 --> 01:11:11,748
I love this job!

928
01:11:18,639 --> 01:11:20,133
Are you all right?

929
01:11:25,270 --> 01:11:27,596
All my make-up is cruelty-free.

930
01:11:29,775 --> 01:11:31,268
You come here often?

931
01:11:31,442 --> 01:11:34,113
Will you take me to the prom?

932
01:11:37,283 --> 01:11:40,282
If you can't accessorize, pulverize.

933
01:11:48,501 --> 01:11:50,162
You've been a bad boy.

934
01:11:50,463 --> 01:11:53,463
Now you must be punished.

935
01:11:56,676 --> 01:11:58,634
Watch out, girls. Hissy fit.

936
01:12:00,888 --> 01:12:02,466
You're to die for.

937
01:12:03,017 --> 01:12:05,590
Run! She's got a baton!

938
01:12:06,812 --> 01:12:08,970
It's a baton death march.

939
01:12:09,898 --> 01:12:11,975
She's gone postal!

940
01:12:17,989 --> 01:12:20,066
Oh, I broke a nail.

941
01:12:20,283 --> 01:12:22,275
I've always hated these things!

942
01:12:22,535 --> 01:12:23,946
The humanity!

943
01:12:25,621 --> 01:12:26,949
This is it, men.

944
01:12:42,305 --> 01:12:46,137
Commandos, the enemy has deployed
a decoy target.

945
01:12:46,227 --> 01:12:48,763
Return to primary positions.

946
01:12:49,770 --> 01:12:51,430
This is fun!

947
01:12:55,818 --> 01:12:57,479
You're killing me!

948
01:13:02,491 --> 01:13:04,318
You rescued me.

949
01:13:07,079 --> 01:13:08,111
Anytime.

950
01:13:10,793 --> 01:13:12,370
Let's go get those creeps.

951
01:13:15,963 --> 01:13:17,789
We have to wake my parents.

952
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:19,961
Open fire!

953
01:13:25,473 --> 01:13:29,305
We have the enemy on the run.
Exploit and pursue.

954
01:13:37,651 --> 01:13:40,356
- You've done this before.
- Once or twice.

955
01:13:49,413 --> 01:13:50,658
Watch it.

956
01:13:51,415 --> 01:13:52,660
You watch it.

957
01:13:57,504 --> 01:13:58,963
We got to get help.

958
01:14:06,429 --> 01:14:08,637
Anyone got a garage door opener?

959
01:14:21,361 --> 01:14:23,270
Commandos, attack!

960
01:14:38,712 --> 01:14:40,290
Time to plant the corn.

961
01:14:44,342 --> 01:14:47,177
Expect no mercy, Gorgonite ally!

962
01:14:53,601 --> 01:14:55,061
I'll get the bike.

963
01:15:11,410 --> 01:15:13,569
Get on! Hurry!

964
01:15:26,634 --> 01:15:28,461
Hot pursuit!

965
01:16:01,879 --> 01:16:02,994
Interlock!

966
01:16:05,298 --> 01:16:07,669
Right side, lock! Left side, lock!

967
01:16:10,679 --> 01:16:12,173
Ramming speed!

968
01:16:28,279 --> 01:16:29,772
Hold on!

969
01:16:54,056 --> 01:16:55,549
They're toast.

970
01:17:02,062 --> 01:17:04,019
You think I could drive home?

971
01:17:04,148 --> 01:17:05,642
Good idea.

972
01:17:23,333 --> 01:17:25,539
- Your kid kidnapped my daughter...
- Uh, oh.

973
01:17:25,627 --> 01:17:29,790
...tied up my son and drugged me
and my wife. Marion is still tripping!

974
01:17:29,923 --> 01:17:31,749
Time to hide again.

975
01:17:32,134 --> 01:17:34,459
Not to mention the damage to my house.

976
01:18:01,205 --> 01:18:02,912
We have lost the battle.

977
01:18:03,122 --> 01:18:05,793
We will not lose the war.

978
01:18:06,458 --> 01:18:07,622
That's the last of them.

979
01:18:12,466 --> 01:18:16,546
I think that's all of Friday's delivery.
Why did they want it back?

980
01:18:16,637 --> 01:18:18,878
You know the clowns
that make these decisions.

981
01:18:18,972 --> 01:18:22,886
They don't care we're standing around
freezing, in the middle of the night...

982
01:18:22,977 --> 01:18:25,218
...as long as everyone knows
who's in charge.

983
01:18:34,737 --> 01:18:36,232
Corporations.

984
01:18:37,156 --> 01:18:40,240
Right hand doesn't know
what the left hand is screwing up.

985
01:18:41,410 --> 01:18:44,411
Greetings. You've been drafted.

986
01:18:45,124 --> 01:18:45,869
Move!

987
01:18:46,374 --> 01:18:48,616
Is this entire household insane?

988
01:18:49,169 --> 01:18:52,502
He says that toy is alive
just because it moves a little.

989
01:18:52,714 --> 01:18:56,378
What's next? The Blue Fairy
drops by with a talking cricket?

990
01:18:56,758 --> 01:18:58,253
He's telling the truth!

991
01:18:59,470 --> 01:19:01,344
He's brainwashed you, hasn't he?

992
01:19:01,932 --> 01:19:06,760
Don't worry, honey. We'll get you
the best deprogrammer money can buy.

993
01:19:06,936 --> 01:19:09,771
You can't change programming.

994
01:19:10,189 --> 01:19:13,025
Look. Another one.

995
01:19:13,526 --> 01:19:17,275
I told you they were hiding.
It's what they do.

996
01:19:18,239 --> 01:19:20,729
That's it. Come on, Christy.

997
01:19:20,866 --> 01:19:22,906
Timmy, Marion, we're out of here.

998
01:19:24,286 --> 01:19:26,078
Don't be a stranger, Phil.

999
01:19:28,874 --> 01:19:34,081
Yes, we're with Heartland Play Systems,
Consumer Satisfaction.

1000
01:19:34,255 --> 01:19:36,627
Is Alan Abernathy here?

1001
01:19:36,715 --> 01:19:38,543
That's Alan, right there.

1002
01:19:39,094 --> 01:19:42,628
How you doing? We understand
you acquired some of our fine products.

1003
01:19:43,432 --> 01:19:45,837
There's a chance they might be...

1004
01:19:47,059 --> 01:19:48,055
...defective.

1005
01:19:48,144 --> 01:19:50,765
But there's no reason to think
they could do any harm.

1006
01:19:50,855 --> 01:19:54,355
- There's reasons.
- There is a problem with the Commandos.

1007
01:19:54,442 --> 01:19:59,352
What problem? Bear in mind, you will be
called into court to support your claim.

1008
01:20:00,822 --> 01:20:03,396
- Your toys nearly killed my son!
- Stuart...

1009
01:20:03,492 --> 01:20:06,327
Don't say calm down!
Calm was killing me.

1010
01:20:06,704 --> 01:20:09,790
And you! You owe my son an apology!

1011
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:14,083
Hey, Larry. Look. It's Archer.

1012
01:20:15,254 --> 01:20:16,334
Greetings.

1013
01:20:16,422 --> 01:20:19,791
I am Archer. Who are you?

1014
01:20:20,175 --> 01:20:22,846
I'm Irwin. I designed you...

1015
01:20:23,095 --> 01:20:24,589
...and all the Gorgonites.

1016
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:26,090
He's the creator.

1017
01:20:30,936 --> 01:20:32,596
You're all here.

1018
01:20:32,814 --> 01:20:34,770
Everyone has to be somewhere.

1019
01:20:35,023 --> 01:20:37,348
That's true. My mom used to...

1020
01:20:39,110 --> 01:20:42,775
Making declarative statements?
Formulating inquiries?

1021
01:20:46,035 --> 01:20:47,908
Lights out.

1022
01:20:50,622 --> 01:20:53,114
Something's going on out there.

1023
01:20:57,546 --> 01:21:01,211
That's weird.
There's a Heartland truck outside.

1024
01:21:14,396 --> 01:21:16,721
- More Commandos?
- A lot more.

1025
01:21:18,275 --> 01:21:21,027
Dad, come see this for yourself.

1026
01:21:21,487 --> 01:21:22,815
Chip?

1027
01:21:24,197 --> 01:21:26,189
Dead Chip? The Chip we killed?

1028
01:21:26,450 --> 01:21:28,692
Maybe we didn't kill him enough.

1029
01:21:29,744 --> 01:21:31,404
Oh, my.

1030
01:21:34,957 --> 01:21:36,536
<i>Commandos, fall out!</i>

1031
01:21:36,918 --> 01:21:40,917
<i>Secure the left perimeter!
Secure the right perimeter! Move out!</i>

1032
01:21:41,507 --> 01:21:42,751
Sir, yes, sir!

1033
01:21:42,924 --> 01:21:45,000
<i>Assault formation. Go!</i>

1034
01:21:49,013 --> 01:21:51,684
<i>If war is hell, let's give them hell.</i>

1035
01:21:51,768 --> 01:21:55,431
<i>We didn't start this war,
but we're damn sure going to end it.</i>

1036
01:21:56,729 --> 01:21:58,556
I'm scared.

1037
01:21:59,942 --> 01:22:02,776
It'll be all right. They're not after you.

1038
01:22:03,235 --> 01:22:05,906
They just want to kill
the little monster people.

1039
01:22:05,990 --> 01:22:09,820
That's right. We're just caught up
in some stupid game.

1040
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:12,651
Well, game over.

1041
01:22:13,538 --> 01:22:15,198
Mr. Fimple, wait.

1042
01:22:15,331 --> 01:22:16,494
No, Alan.

1043
01:22:16,958 --> 01:22:18,452
Let him go.

1044
01:22:23,465 --> 01:22:24,792
Archer.

1045
01:22:25,049 --> 01:22:27,801
The Gorgonites must lose.

1046
01:22:32,099 --> 01:22:33,427
Hi!

1047
01:22:34,267 --> 01:22:35,926
I'm Phil Fimple.

1048
01:22:36,936 --> 01:22:40,601
I'm here to negotiate the surrender of the...

1049
01:22:40,982 --> 01:22:42,310
...Gorgonzolas.

1050
01:22:42,525 --> 01:22:45,016
Here's our proposal: Take them!

1051
01:22:45,153 --> 01:22:47,904
He's selling us out.
He's an Arnold Benedict.

1052
01:22:48,406 --> 01:22:52,190
Take them apart, steal their batteries,
whatever it is you...

1053
01:22:52,451 --> 01:22:54,112
...people do.

1054
01:22:59,416 --> 01:23:01,574
Is that my JVC?

1055
01:23:03,588 --> 01:23:05,248
<i>There will be no surrender!</i>

1056
01:23:05,339 --> 01:23:09,253
<i>There will be no mercy!
All Gorgonite scum must die!</i>

1057
01:23:10,553 --> 01:23:12,676
Bomb them all the way back to preschool.

1058
01:23:12,763 --> 01:23:15,598
Recon estimates
Gorgonite scum strength at 16!

1059
01:23:16,267 --> 01:23:19,101
Sixteen? Where did they get sixteen from?

1060
01:23:19,436 --> 01:23:22,272
Seven Gorgonites and nine people.

1061
01:23:24,317 --> 01:23:26,273
Well, you heard our proposal.

1062
01:23:26,402 --> 01:23:28,227
Phil, get in here! Hurry!

1063
01:23:28,695 --> 01:23:31,365
<i>These negotiations are over!</i>

1064
01:23:37,038 --> 01:23:39,706
<i>We are the Commando Elite.
Everything else...</i>

1065
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:41,618
<i>...is just a toy.</i>

1066
01:23:49,341 --> 01:23:52,674
- What are they doing?
- Psychological warfare.

1067
01:23:53,137 --> 01:23:55,710
The Marines did this against Noriega.

1068
01:23:57,307 --> 01:23:58,636
Phil.

1069
01:24:00,978 --> 01:24:03,137
I love this song!

1070
01:24:06,524 --> 01:24:09,194
Fimple, turn that off!

1071
01:24:12,739 --> 01:24:14,947
Go, go!

1072
01:24:19,579 --> 01:24:21,406
Lock and load.

1073
01:24:22,623 --> 01:24:23,952
Nail them!

1074
01:24:24,459 --> 01:24:26,203
Open fire!

1075
01:24:27,003 --> 01:24:28,083
Get down!

1076
01:24:38,725 --> 01:24:40,052
Fimple.

1077
01:24:44,021 --> 01:24:45,015
Honey?

1078
01:24:46,732 --> 01:24:49,936
Stuart, Phil, barricade that window!
Alan, get back.

1079
01:24:51,862 --> 01:24:53,522
Get back!

1080
01:24:59,327 --> 01:25:00,987
Fire!

1081
01:25:04,874 --> 01:25:05,953
Wow.

1082
01:25:06,084 --> 01:25:07,412
Fire!

1083
01:25:07,669 --> 01:25:09,330
How are they...

1084
01:25:10,297 --> 01:25:14,210
Alan, put out the fires.
Nerds, side windows.

1085
01:25:21,849 --> 01:25:23,510
Marion, Timmy...

1086
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:27,428
...the closet. Come on, come on. Hurry!

1087
01:25:30,359 --> 01:25:32,932
Just get in. Get down.

1088
01:25:34,905 --> 01:25:36,564
I have that coat.

1089
01:25:36,822 --> 01:25:37,688
Yes.

1090
01:25:39,492 --> 01:25:40,736
Frag 'em all!

1091
01:25:44,538 --> 01:25:45,784
I'll call the police!

1092
01:25:45,873 --> 01:25:48,544
Phil, Christy, push this back. Careful.

1093
01:25:51,086 --> 01:25:51,952
Fire!

1094
01:25:55,299 --> 01:25:56,331
Service.

1095
01:25:58,177 --> 01:25:59,921
Great balls of fire!

1096
01:26:01,599 --> 01:26:04,265
The phone's dead. Nice forehand, honey.

1097
01:26:05,935 --> 01:26:06,847
Incoming!

1098
01:26:07,478 --> 01:26:08,557
I'm hit!

1099
01:26:10,232 --> 01:26:11,726
More shells!

1100
01:26:12,149 --> 01:26:13,395
Take the house!

1101
01:26:13,985 --> 01:26:16,736
We have to stop them
before my wife gets tennis elbow.

1102
01:26:17,029 --> 01:26:20,564
An electromagnetic pulse would work.
That would fry the chips.

1103
01:26:24,495 --> 01:26:26,986
All we need now is a nuclear warhead.

1104
01:26:27,373 --> 01:26:29,615
I doubt I'll have one in the junk drawer.

1105
01:26:30,125 --> 01:26:31,500
Nuclear warhead?

1106
01:26:31,586 --> 01:26:35,880
The chips aren't shielded against an EMP.
A nuclear blast would wipe them out.

1107
01:26:36,089 --> 01:26:38,249
That's why the military never used them.

1108
01:26:38,342 --> 01:26:41,343
What kind of moron would put
military technology in toys?

1109
01:26:41,429 --> 01:26:43,218
That would be Gizmo over here.

1110
01:26:47,433 --> 01:26:51,433
Actually, any electrical device generates
a magnetic field, just not a big one.

1111
01:26:51,897 --> 01:26:53,725
We'll need a big one.

1112
01:26:56,401 --> 01:26:57,980
Fire in the hole!

1113
01:27:07,121 --> 01:27:09,278
Alan, the window.

1114
01:27:10,749 --> 01:27:14,914
"I don't know but I've been told
Gorgonite blood runs mighty cold."

1115
01:27:15,505 --> 01:27:17,164
No, Alan.

1116
01:27:20,802 --> 01:27:22,627
Way to stay heads up.

1117
01:27:25,013 --> 01:27:27,718
Continue artillery barrage!

1118
01:27:27,808 --> 01:27:29,468
Take cover! Stay low!

1119
01:27:30,185 --> 01:27:33,305
There's a power pole back there
with two huge transformers.

1120
01:27:33,397 --> 01:27:36,351
Could we use those to create
the electromagnetic whatever?

1121
01:27:36,524 --> 01:27:38,516
We could get them to explode.

1122
01:27:38,777 --> 01:27:40,603
That would fry their chips, for sure.

1123
01:27:42,238 --> 01:27:44,196
You could connect the transformers.

1124
01:27:44,282 --> 01:27:47,733
We just need to put something metal
between them.

1125
01:27:47,827 --> 01:27:51,872
You get a nice power boost.
Right up until they overload and blow up.

1126
01:27:52,457 --> 01:27:53,655
It only happened once!

1127
01:27:58,965 --> 01:28:00,079
That's it.

1128
01:28:07,139 --> 01:28:08,550
This should work.

1129
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:17,094
Forget it. You're not going out there.

1130
01:28:17,190 --> 01:28:19,349
- There's no time!
- It's too dangerous.

1131
01:28:19,443 --> 01:28:20,901
We've only got one chance!

1132
01:28:21,068 --> 01:28:22,861
You are my responsibility and...

1133
01:28:23,405 --> 01:28:26,238
Dad, there's no other way!

1134
01:28:35,417 --> 01:28:37,409
You have to trust me.

1135
01:28:37,878 --> 01:28:38,791
Wait.

1136
01:28:40,797 --> 01:28:42,256
It's dark in here.

1137
01:28:42,382 --> 01:28:43,876
It's night, genius.

1138
01:28:43,967 --> 01:28:48,794
I mean, power has to be going through
the transformers for them to overload.

1139
01:28:51,558 --> 01:28:54,973
The power's on at my house
and we've tons of crap to turn on.

1140
01:28:55,061 --> 01:28:59,723
We have to wedge the breakers
open in your fuse box. Come on, Larry.

1141
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:01,560
I hate you, Irwin.

1142
01:29:05,738 --> 01:29:08,229
We have met the enemy and he is you!

1143
01:29:15,206 --> 01:29:18,041
I love the smell of polyurethane
in the morning.

1144
01:29:22,546 --> 01:29:25,038
Oh, my God. Phil, in here, in here.

1145
01:29:26,592 --> 01:29:27,922
It's locked.

1146
01:29:32,389 --> 01:29:33,588
Up, up, up.

1147
01:29:35,518 --> 01:29:36,928
Balcony's closed.

1148
01:29:37,394 --> 01:29:38,676
Down, down, down.

1149
01:29:38,813 --> 01:29:40,890
Descend and destroy.

1150
01:29:45,194 --> 01:29:48,776
Let me in. Damn it! Fimple, you freak!
Let me in!

1151
01:29:50,491 --> 01:29:53,991
All quiet on the Western front yard!

1152
01:29:55,329 --> 01:29:58,661
Go and turn on every piece
of electronic equipment in your house.

1153
01:29:58,749 --> 01:30:01,418
This one's for Nick Nitro!

1154
01:30:06,215 --> 01:30:08,124
Mess around with my kid, huh?

1155
01:30:08,217 --> 01:30:10,707
A broomstick. I'm scared.

1156
01:30:10,803 --> 01:30:11,965
Get him!

1157
01:30:12,429 --> 01:30:13,461
First blood!

1158
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:16,882
Stick this in your pipe and smoke it!

1159
01:30:23,065 --> 01:30:24,393
All right, Dad!

1160
01:30:26,151 --> 01:30:27,645
We roasted them!

1161
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:30,812
There they are. Nail 'em!

1162
01:30:32,492 --> 01:30:33,653
Not good.

1163
01:30:34,159 --> 01:30:37,161
Hey, kid! Don't you like 9-inch nails?

1164
01:30:40,164 --> 01:30:41,991
I got hit. I'm okay.

1165
01:30:44,837 --> 01:30:47,838
Gorgonites, we must help Alan.

1166
01:30:48,507 --> 01:30:51,507
But if we fight, we will lose.

1167
01:30:51,885 --> 01:30:54,555
Last time we fought,
I woke up with AM/FM.

1168
01:30:54,639 --> 01:30:56,631
War is nuts.
I know what I'm talking about.

1169
01:30:56,723 --> 01:30:59,215
We shouldn't fight. We should hide.

1170
01:30:59,809 --> 01:31:02,645
If we hide, we will still lose.

1171
01:31:03,146 --> 01:31:05,305
No more hiding.

1172
01:31:06,482 --> 01:31:08,060
Nail them to the wall!

1173
01:31:12,571 --> 01:31:13,984
Gorgonites, fight!

1174
01:31:20,206 --> 01:31:23,371
Sanctuary! Sanctuary!

1175
01:31:31,341 --> 01:31:32,253
Strike!

1176
01:31:32,342 --> 01:31:34,168
Retreat!

1177
01:31:37,097 --> 01:31:39,385
Meet my wife, the old ball and chain.

1178
01:31:39,474 --> 01:31:41,384
I love working in the round.

1179
01:31:41,518 --> 01:31:44,804
I'm knocking 'em dead.
You don't like stand-up? Then sit down!

1180
01:31:44,895 --> 01:31:47,517
Thank you and good night,
ladies and germs.

1181
01:31:51,652 --> 01:31:54,571
How do you work this? Wrong way.
That's better.

1182
01:31:54,655 --> 01:31:55,818
Alan?

1183
01:32:00,704 --> 01:32:02,280
You should go now.

1184
01:32:02,705 --> 01:32:04,698
Archer, listen.

1185
01:32:05,083 --> 01:32:08,866
When that thing explodes,
you'll be fried, too.

1186
01:32:10,755 --> 01:32:12,083
Go.

1187
01:32:16,386 --> 01:32:18,711
Take that!

1188
01:32:21,432 --> 01:32:22,807
Watch your back.

1189
01:32:22,892 --> 01:32:24,385
Thanks, Dad.

1190
01:32:28,773 --> 01:32:30,931
I'm watching your back, Alan.

1191
01:32:44,330 --> 01:32:46,157
What are you packing, Tiny?

1192
01:32:46,291 --> 01:32:48,447
Packing? I'm packing you!

1193
01:32:55,257 --> 01:32:58,128
It's not a prank call. It's not.

1194
01:32:58,219 --> 01:32:59,879
No, wait. It is!

1195
01:33:00,303 --> 01:33:04,551
So you'll send some cops
to come and arrest me? Don't hang up!

1196
01:33:07,728 --> 01:33:09,520
Do you know what you're doing?

1197
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:11,767
Yeah.

1198
01:33:39,510 --> 01:33:40,458
Die!

1199
01:33:45,724 --> 01:33:47,800
Ain't war hell?

1200
01:33:56,402 --> 01:33:58,559
Thanks for the lift, Punch-it.

1201
01:34:05,410 --> 01:34:07,568
Mayday! Mayday! I'm hit!

1202
01:34:10,082 --> 01:34:12,572
I'm going down! Ejecting!

1203
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:30,090
Expect no mercy.

1204
01:34:54,710 --> 01:34:56,287
Having fun yet?

1205
01:35:03,050 --> 01:35:06,467
Let's have a round and a round
of applause for Archer...

1206
01:35:06,555 --> 01:35:09,556
...emissary of the Gorgonites. You're up!

1207
01:35:15,646 --> 01:35:17,474
Major Chip Hazard.

1208
01:35:18,149 --> 01:35:20,474
Gorgonite scum!

1209
01:35:20,652 --> 01:35:23,688
Leave Alan alone. Your fight is with me.

1210
01:35:23,822 --> 01:35:25,814
You've got a lot of guts.

1211
01:35:26,157 --> 01:35:28,483
Let's see what they look like.

1212
01:35:30,663 --> 01:35:33,746
They're wires and metal,
the same as yours.

1213
01:35:36,166 --> 01:35:40,331
We're nothing alike.
You are programmed to lose.

1214
01:35:43,216 --> 01:35:45,255
I'm also programmed to learn.

1215
01:35:46,845 --> 01:35:49,845
Too bad you never learned to win.

1216
01:35:53,016 --> 01:35:55,010
School's out, loser.

1217
01:36:02,651 --> 01:36:04,276
Victory is ours!

1218
01:36:04,404 --> 01:36:06,312
Have I got a shock for you.

1219
01:36:07,532 --> 01:36:09,358
You stupid toy!

1220
01:36:33,349 --> 01:36:35,341
Run for it! Watch out!

1221
01:36:50,199 --> 01:36:51,528
Get on!

1222
01:36:52,952 --> 01:36:55,952
Is this going to be a pattern
for our relationship?

1223
01:36:56,454 --> 01:36:57,782
Relationship?

1224
01:36:59,709 --> 01:37:02,199
- This isn't dangerous, is it?
- Well...

1225
01:37:14,390 --> 01:37:15,883
It's dead!

1226
01:37:23,232 --> 01:37:24,476
Are you all right?

1227
01:37:36,078 --> 01:37:37,239
Medic!

1228
01:37:38,789 --> 01:37:41,114
There will be no mercy.

1229
01:37:54,596 --> 01:37:57,763
Situation is stabilizing.
Local law enforcement is under control.

1230
01:37:57,849 --> 01:38:01,134
It's just a matter of compensating
those involved.

1231
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:13,948
The area is secure. Bring him in.

1232
01:38:18,285 --> 01:38:20,277
Who is that?

1233
01:38:22,124 --> 01:38:24,958
Oh, no. It's him.

1234
01:38:47,940 --> 01:38:49,435
How you doing, Joe?

1235
01:38:49,985 --> 01:38:52,225
- Would you do me a big favor?
- Anything, sir.

1236
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:57,147
Move your truck with the giant GloboTech
logo before the news crews get here.

1237
01:38:58,326 --> 01:39:01,327
I don't know, Mr. Mars,
I may have trouble handling the gears.

1238
01:39:01,579 --> 01:39:05,576
What with the critical head injury
and emotional distress I've suffered lately.

1239
01:39:07,668 --> 01:39:09,578
- Thank you.
- Right away, sir!

1240
01:39:09,754 --> 01:39:12,126
Excuse me. You're not off the hook yet.

1241
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:15,625
There's the matter of the massive damage
to my home, my garage...

1242
01:39:15,718 --> 01:39:18,339
...my audio-visual system...

1243
01:39:18,596 --> 01:39:20,422
- This is good.
- Bye-bye.

1244
01:39:21,264 --> 01:39:25,429
Excuse me, Mr. Whoever-You-Are.
What about our house?

1245
01:39:27,730 --> 01:39:29,888
What about the pain and the anguish...

1246
01:39:30,024 --> 01:39:32,015
- Humiliation.
- The humiliation.

1247
01:39:32,192 --> 01:39:35,027
I don't think even you
have enough money to pay for that.

1248
01:39:35,447 --> 01:39:37,771
Okay, maybe you do.

1249
01:39:38,615 --> 01:39:40,774
Hey, Alan. Keep your nose clean, kid.

1250
01:39:40,867 --> 01:39:43,359
I'll try. Listen...

1251
01:39:44,539 --> 01:39:46,697
...I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

1252
01:39:48,459 --> 01:39:49,787
Forget it.

1253
01:39:51,753 --> 01:39:53,415
Toys is hell.

1254
01:39:54,215 --> 01:39:59,042
Mr. Mars, I just wanted
to assure you that...

1255
01:40:00,012 --> 01:40:02,502
...I take full responsibility for this.

1256
01:40:02,598 --> 01:40:04,840
Yeah, right. Give me that.

1257
01:40:05,517 --> 01:40:07,510
What were we charging for these?

1258
01:40:07,603 --> 01:40:09,346
$79.95.

1259
01:40:09,854 --> 01:40:12,180
Add a few zeros
to the end of that number...

1260
01:40:12,441 --> 01:40:14,350
...and contact our military division.

1261
01:40:14,943 --> 01:40:18,776
I know some South American rebels
who will find these toys very entertaining.

1262
01:40:20,198 --> 01:40:22,357
Dad, you know my birthday?

1263
01:40:23,701 --> 01:40:26,027
I just want clothes.

1264
01:40:26,496 --> 01:40:27,824
Come on, Christy.

1265
01:40:33,212 --> 01:40:34,954
Any sign of the Gorgonites?

1266
01:40:35,046 --> 01:40:37,038
No, none of them.

1267
01:40:38,300 --> 01:40:39,793
Come on, Christy.

1268
01:40:40,051 --> 01:40:41,380
I better go.

1269
01:40:51,396 --> 01:40:54,895
Too bad. This would have made
a hell of a commercial.

1270
01:41:27,932 --> 01:41:29,260
Archer?

1271
01:41:43,907 --> 01:41:47,738
Archer, are you all right?
Halt! Who goes there?

1272
01:41:48,912 --> 01:41:52,245
Greetings. I am Archer,
emissary of the Gorgonites.

1273
01:41:52,373 --> 01:41:55,658
Greetings. I am Archer,
emissary of the Gorgonites.

1274
01:41:56,877 --> 01:41:59,582
Your chip got fried,
just like the Commandos'.

1275
01:42:01,757 --> 01:42:03,584
The Commandos are dead?

1276
01:42:07,096 --> 01:42:10,014
Gorgonites, we won.

1277
01:42:10,265 --> 01:42:11,926
We did?

1278
01:42:12,102 --> 01:42:14,770
Well, that's a pleasant surprise.

1279
01:42:15,854 --> 01:42:19,306
The satellite dish must have shielded
you guys. Pretty smart.

1280
01:42:19,441 --> 01:42:20,935
Smart? We were lucky.

1281
01:42:21,027 --> 01:42:22,854
I'm glad you made it, Archer.

1282
01:42:22,945 --> 01:42:25,614
I'm glad you made it, Alan.

1283
01:42:28,116 --> 01:42:30,156
Gorgonites, we are free!

1284
01:42:30,536 --> 01:42:32,862
Thank you, Alan, destroyer of Commandos.

1285
01:42:32,955 --> 01:42:34,152
We're free.

1286
01:42:34,288 --> 01:42:36,034
Free? What about the cover charge?

1287
01:42:37,877 --> 01:42:40,202
Let me get in first. I'm big.

1288
01:42:40,338 --> 01:42:43,956
I'll sit in the crow's nest.
Hey, there's a dead crow up here.

1289
01:42:44,633 --> 01:42:46,127
I'm kidding.

1290
01:42:49,637 --> 01:42:51,513
Are you sure you want to do this?

1291
01:42:51,598 --> 01:42:53,924
Yes, Alan. It is time.

1292
01:42:54,643 --> 01:42:57,313
Archer, I understand why, but...

1293
01:42:57,981 --> 01:43:01,645
...you may not find Gorgon.
It may not even...

1294
01:43:02,318 --> 01:43:06,980
Even if you can't see something,
it doesn't mean it isn't there.

1295
01:43:14,997 --> 01:43:17,074
Look, we're out to launch!

1296
01:43:18,626 --> 01:43:20,784
I'm seasick already.

1297
01:43:21,338 --> 01:43:22,498
Bye-bye, Alan.

1298
01:43:22,588 --> 01:43:26,003
Bye-bye, Alan. Nice knowing you.

1299
01:43:56,538 --> 01:44:00,157
Anybody from out of town here?
Where are you from, sir?

1300
01:44:00,251 --> 01:44:01,246
Gorgon.

1301
01:44:01,334 --> 01:44:05,663
What exit? Hello? Is this thing on?
Is this a boat or an oil painting?

1302
01:44:06,214 --> 01:44:09,216
I hope we don't hit an iceberg.

1303
01:49:26,366 --> 01:49:29,070
Nuclear warhead?
What are you talking about?

1304
01:49:30,159 --> 01:49:31,653
Was that too much?

1305
01:49:36,500 --> 01:49:38,825
<i>I've never heard you say that before.</i>

1306
01:49:39,305 --> 01:50:39,212
