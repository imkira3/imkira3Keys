My Purge playlist.

00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,473
I put a lot of thought into it,
especially this final tune

7
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,679
as it will be the last
song you'll ever hear.

8

George's psychedelic rock will leave
you feeling funky, obviously.

the least I can do.

MALE REPORTER: This is just one of a
dozen protests around our capital

22
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,909
after reports emerged claiming
that the New Founding Fathers

23
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,834
had been using the Purge to
help their own economic agenda.

24
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,959
Here's a recent statement by incendiary
Purge detractor Dante Bishop.

25
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,675
For the past 20 years,
the NFFA has taken to legalized murder

26
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,990
to decrease
the poor population,

27
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,674
which in turn keeps the
government's spending down.

28
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,355

less healthcare, less housing.

that the growing anti-Purge sentiment

may have a monumental effect on the
upcoming presidential election.

Establishment NFFA candidate
Minister Edwidge Owens

00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,594
has been losing ground to wildcard
Independent candidate Senator Charlie Roan.

33
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,670
Eighteen years ago, Roan was forced
to watch the brutal execution

34
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,910
of her entire family
on Purge Night

35
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,913
and entered the political arena
soon after with one goal in mind.

To put an end to
the annual holiday.

of our country is at stake.

That the Purge benefits

00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,950
He actually think you can
win this thing. Oh, yeah?

635
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,548
(LAUGHS) Shit! Tell her what
she need to do to win, Marcos.

636
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,039
No, it's not
my place to say.

637
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:15,238
Well, you saved my life, Marcos.
I'd like to hear it, please.

638
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,076
Florida is the key.

639
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,791
You have to get
the elders.

640
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,753
That's smart.

641
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,031
He's not wrong, Joe.
What do you think?

642
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,391
I don't think you
got a damn chance.

643
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,518
Well, have
a little faith.

644
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,996
Well, I lost my faith in the system
a long time ago, Senator. Water?

645
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,520
Thank you.

Maybe we stay here.

You going back out there?

648
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,274
Joe, do you have a first aid kit?
Leo, my security, was shot.

649
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,316
I'm fine.
You're not fine.

650
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,470
I'm fine.
You're not. Sit.

651
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,317

to take it off?

It's nothing.

Let me see.

656
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,400
I know a little bit about first aid.
I could help you.

657
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,835
The bullet's deep.

658
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,149
You need stitches.
Yeah.

659
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,275
But we can't
do that here.

660
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,476
Right. Clean it up. Patch it up.
Come on. Move.

661
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,440
Okay.

What about you guys?
Who are you?

It's very necessary.

Mexico City.

668
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,795
But I've been an American
citizen for two years.

669
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,279
You got a record?

Not here.

in Mexico?

I tried to survive.

673

What are you doing
out on Purge Night?

674

Protecting the deli
against looters

675
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,835
because my boss lost his
Purge insurance yesterday.

676
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,434
Yeah, that's something
you can look into, Senator.

677
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,636

screwing the working man.

You know what,
Mr. Secret Service Man?

681

You should be thanking my

interrogating me.

His name is Joe Dixon.

LEO: Joe Dixon, have I offended you?
JOE: Yeah.

685

Yeah, man,
just a little bit.

Your feelings are
not a concern of mine.

telling you about.

And I'm gonna
get that candy bar.

and they're coming inside.

All right. I got to
get you outta here.

Yeah, but they're
at both entrances.

Then I'm gonna Purge by killing you
and burning this bitch to the ground!

there in a triage van.

01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,718
LEO: How many people
know about this place?

952
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:06,634
Just the volunteers, and the
homeless that we invite in.

953
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,072
Look, these are the real
victims of the Purge.

954
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:14,351
The people that the NFFA
are trying to eliminate

955
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:17,193
so that they don't have to
take care of them anymore.

956
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:22,271
These men that are armed,

957
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:24,635
you'll have them at all the
entrances and the rooftop?

958
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:27,109
Yes. My men will
keep you safe.

959
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:29,910
Or as safe as you
can be on Purge Night.

960
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,039
Appreciate it.

961
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:37,028
Mr. Bishop.
Yeah.

962
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:41,793
Thank you, for all of this.
I am impressed.

963
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:45,272
Well, don't thank me.
Thank the volunteers.

964
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:48,877
Mr. Bishop,
I've heard stories

965
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:53,550
of tactics that you
employ on Purge Night.

966
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:57,189
I can't say that
I agree with any of it.

967
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,473
I'll tell you what.

968
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:02,069
You get elected,

969
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,438
you stop this night,

970
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:08,238
and I don't have
to do what I do anymore.

971
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,159
Let's go, Angel.

972
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:13,388
Fair enough.

973
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:26,073
BISHOP: You hold down
the fort here.

974
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:30,153
Keep an eye on her. And keep her
and her people quiet. Okay?

975
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:31,713
All right,
let's go!

976
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:10,632
I want access to every
surveillance camera in the city.

977
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:14,110
We'll do a grid search
for that fucking triage van.

978
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,708
It's out there somewhere.
Find it.

979
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:24,520
Yeah.

980
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:27,797
Your crew? Your guys?
They feel like family?

981
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:32,680
Boss.

982
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:35,638
We did the
right thing.

983
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:38,880
Yeah.

984
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:42,592
But it's time to go.

985
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:44,593
Gotta get back
to the deli.

986
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:48,836
What? No. Are you fucking crazy?
We're safe here.

987
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:51,070
Laney, you know I'll
walk back if I have to.

988
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:54,031
Fine. I'll drive you.

989
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:57,512
But if we run into any problems,
we're coming right back here.

990
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:58,600
Deal.

991
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:06,520
SENATOR ROAN:
Really? Can you do that?

992
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:10,075
We'll see her
again, Marcos.

993
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,358
And she's safe here.

994
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:14,674
Let's hit it.

995
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:21,757
I don't know, but I bet it
was really cool. (LAUGHS)

996
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:23,874
It is, it is.

997
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:28,078
Hey, you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.

998
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:29,480
Good.

999
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:31,875
I'm gonna go take a look around.
Okay.

1000
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:33,629
Stay here.

1001
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,313
Okay, boss.

1002
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:06,878
What are you
doing here?

1003
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:10,075
Hand.
Why are you here?

1004
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:13,471
(GRUNTING)

1005
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:15,073
(CLATTERING)

1006
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:19,598
(GRUNTING)

1007
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:21,073
What the hell's
going on here?

1008
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:23,310
He was snooping around!
Hey, hey! Okay, okay, okay.

1009
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,190
Hey! Hey.
It's all right. It's all right.

1010
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:28,754
Red, back up.
It's okay. (MAN CHOKING)

1011
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:31,993
Just put the gun down, all right?
Everybody's okay.

1012
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,149
Back up.

1013
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:34,829
We're okay.

1014
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:38,470
All right?
All right?

1015
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:41,634
We're good.
It's all good, okay?

1016
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:43,392
I'm just getting
my weapon.

1017
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:45,519
What's going on?

1018
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:46,828
Just doing my job.

1019
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:48,558
Senator, it's just
a misunderstanding.

1020
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,517
Why don't we
go back outside?

1021
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:51,989
Come on.

1022
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:56,936
SENATOR ROAN:
Are you seeing this, Leo?

1023
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,439
LEO: Yes, Senator.

1024
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:00,113
Senator, why don't
we go outside...

1025
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,200
Stop.

1026
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:06,108
Those are the Minister's
biggest financial supporters.

1027
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:09,038
The NFFA.

1028
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:12,429
Our Lady of Sorrows.

1029
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:18,034
Is that where the Minister is going
to be tonight for the Purge Mass?

1030
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:20,111
We believe so.
You believe... (SCOFFS)

1031
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,553
What is all this?

1032
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,636
Why do you have all this?

1033
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:36,597
You're gonna assassinate him.

1034
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:42,472
You're gonna assassinate the
Minister tonight, aren't you?

1035
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:49,840
You know, somebody's
got to say it out loud.

1036
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:51,958
What in the fuck
happened tonight?

1037
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:53,712
Nobody's gonna
believe it.

1038
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:54,800
Mmm-hmm.

1039
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:58,439
Irish Ike's gonna
be like, "Bullshit.

1040
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:01,950
"Now where's my waffles and pussy?"
"...and pussy?"

1041
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:04,514
(ALL LAUGHING)

1042
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:06,238
He got that
one-track mind.

1043
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:08,436
That boy done
lost his mind.

1044
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:09,589
Shit.

1045
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:12,993
I hope he's
okay tonight.

1046
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:15,915
Yeah.

1047
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:23,192
Hold on, guys.
Look.

1048
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:27,311
Those are
government trucks.

1049
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:30,074
I saw them on YouTube
from last year's Purge.

1050
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:32,915
And they're going straight
back towards the Safe Zone.

1051
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:37,555
You cannot do this. I need to win
this thing fair and fucking square.

1052
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:40,950
They are not playing fair and fucking
square and neither should we.

1053
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,270
This church will be
locked up like Fort Knox.

1054
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,560
You'll never get through.
You're gonna get slaughtered.

1055
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:47,950
Four churches were
built on that site.

1056
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:51,316
The original by your boy George
Washington over 200 years ago.

1057
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:54,233
The man liked to have escape tunnels
attached to all his structures.

1058
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:55,639
They're all over D.C.

1059
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:57,517
The tunnel under
the original church

1060
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:59,750
has been closed up
since the '50s.

1061
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,068
But we reopened it.

1062
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:02,560
We're gonna walk
right through there

1063
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:05,592
and into that church without
anybody even knowing it.

1064
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:09,514
The original Founding Fathers are about
to fuck over the New Founding Fathers.

1065
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,909
Now how you like
that for irony?

1066
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:15,151
How do you know where
this mass is gonna be?

1067
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:18,835
Because we do whatever it takes.
We did this for you, Senator.

1068
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:21,576
No, it's not for me. Get your boss
on the phone. I need to talk to him.

1069
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,830
He's not here.
Angel, listen to me.

1070
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,035
You call him.

1071
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:29,830
You tell him he does this and
the Minister becomes a martyr.

1072
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:33,037
I cannot have my presidency
built on murder. You see that.

1073
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:35,549
He will not leave
this to the voters.

1074
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:37,676
He does not believe
in the American system.

1075
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:39,296
Angel, believe in me.
I can make this happen.

1076
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:41,096
We do. That's why we're
trying to pave a way for you

1077
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:42,696
to the White House
so you can make changes.

1078

SENATOR ROAN: You're gonna
cost me the White House.

1079

It's Laney. She says there's
trucks approaching us.

1080

What?

1081
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:50,229
Who is that?

1082
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:53,913
Government soldiers.

1083
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,356
That's the NFFA eliminating
all their enemies this year.

1084

They're here for Bishop,
but they will kill you.

1085
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:02,776
You need to evacuate your people.
We can't move the injured.

come out?

Third and Thompson.

LEO: Third and Thompson.
Give me the phone.

1090
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:13,634
Laney, I need you
at Third and Thompson now.

1091
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:15,312
Yeah, we'll meet
you there.

back into that war zone?

staircase to the balcony.

1263
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:00,272
Me and my guys, we're gonna enter from
behind the altar and this side here.

1264
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:02,960
Okay, good. Let's go
get our girl, yeah?

1265
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:12,792
Before we get to our communal Purge,
the Holy Horde of Many Martyrs,

1266
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:16,474
I'd like to introduce
a guest

1267
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:22,393
who's going to be the centerpiece of a
very special Purge ceremony tonight.

1268
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:26,394
This person

1269
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:31,475
has threatened to
dismantle everything

1270
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:34,592
that we, New Founding
Fathers, have done.

1271
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:41,955
We must rid ourselves

1272
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:49,875
of the negative emotions
that she has stirred inside.

1273
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:56,274
We must stop her from
poisoning our great country

1274
01:27:56,920 --> 01:27:59,957
by taking away
our freedoms.

1275
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:04,360
Yes!
(APPLAUSE)

1276
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:21,034
I would like all the Founding
Fathers to come to the altar.

1277
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,033
Join me, brothers,

1278
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:26,712
as we eliminate evil

1279
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:29,557
and Purge as one.

1280
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:35,878
(SINGING) There is a fountain

1282
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:46,911
And sinners,
plunged beneath that flood

1283
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:53,395
Lose all their
guilty stains

we ask that you receive this
child into your loving arms.

1288
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:21,389
We are sinners.

1289
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:23,238
Let us release.

1290
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:27,228
Caleb, our leader,

1291
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:30,597
I invite you, sir,
to lead us in this Purging

1292
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:34,709
as you have
and as you will.

1293

that the Senator has
also taken Florida,
