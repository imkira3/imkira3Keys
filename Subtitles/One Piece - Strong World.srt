1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,550
This is madness.

3
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:34,980
There's only one man I know who's capable of doing this.

4
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:07,280
The survivor of the Pirate King Gol D. Roger's generation...

5
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:12,440
Where have you been hiding for the last 20 years?

6
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:17,210
You lost to Roger and then got apprehended by the marines...

7
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:22,430
The man who cut off his feet, shook off his shackles, and escaped from prison.

8
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:25,410
The Golden Lion, Shiki.

9
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,330
This is a warning.

10
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,750
Fire! Fire!

11
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,810
I wish you would've remained just a legend...

12
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:14,230
Yet, you've resurfaced to take your revenge on this world?

13
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,420
I have to find the guys.

14
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,740

A praying mantis?!

19
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,920
One after another. Seriously, what's wrong with this island?

20
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,730
Bastard, you wanna go?

21
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,890

That's right, I can't underestimate the animals on this island.

Giant Pistol

32
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,560
That was dangerous.

33
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:35,860
Shrinking after using this technique is such a pain...

34
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:40,540
This octopus looks yummy.

35
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,900
I wonder what that sound was...

36
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,750
Who knows... We don't have time for that.

37
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,870
NO!!!

38
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:05,570
What's wrong?

39
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:11,550
Now it's ants?!

40
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,860
You're coming for us?

41
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,660
Franky, didn't you run out of fuel?

42
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,110
That's right!

43
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,300
It's coming back.

44
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:21,880
Just like me.

45
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,660
Are you guys okay?

46
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:27,850
Now I know why they didn't go for you.

47
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,000
'Cause to them you don't have any substance.

48
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,850
Ah...

49
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,910
Isn't that a bit rude?!

Yes, I'm only bones, but that's because I have an interest...

55
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,380
In dieting.

56
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,090
Anyway, what's wrong with this island?

57
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,860
Animals and bugs have evolved to a stage I've never seen before.

58
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:06,330
They exert far greater strength and intelligence than humans, and rely on that to live.

59
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,490
An island befitting the survival of the fittest.

71
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,240
Hurry up and let me out of here.

72
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,740
What a strong-willed girl.

73
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,050
I have to say I don't dislike that kind of woman.

74
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:00,770
Can't you do a damn thing about the sound of your footsteps, Dr. Indigo?

75
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,730
What the hell are you trying to say?!

76
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,540
Come to think of it, I have something to show you.

77
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,760
You can talk?!

78
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,890
M-Mom?

79
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,400
It's a freaking gorilla!

80
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,070
Don't look at me.

81
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,640
You're as cold as ice, Baby-chan.

82
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,970
What were we thinking?

83
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:42,890
One week ago

84
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,270
What about East Blue?

85
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:55,400
The mysterious disappearance of villages due to menacing attacks.

86
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:00,190
It appears that many villages in East Blue have disappeared overnight.

87
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:07,320
Currently, the islands we're from are fine, but I don't know how long it's gonna stay that way.

88
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:12,510
Luffy, Zoro, Nami, and Usopp were born in East Blue.

89
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:13,620
I see.

90
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,970
Oh, was Sanji too?

91
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:21,300
Well, I was born in North Blue, but I was raised in East Blue.

92
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,190
What's that? A relic?

93
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,030
What's that?!

94
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,320
An island...!

95
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,830
Why is that island floating?!

96
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,350
They have a flag.

97
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:58,270
Is that a vessel?

98
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,690
They have a skull flag! Is it a pirate ship?

99
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,100
A floating island-ship?

100
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,260
This wind...

101
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,820
This course is dangerous, Luffy.

102
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,490
A cyclone is approaching soon!

103
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:13,930
Really?

104
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:17,460
I see. Let's inform them as well.

105
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:22,320
Hey, there's a cyclone coming!

106
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,900
You sure about this?

107
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,170
It seems like he's shouting something.

108
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:28,790
Are they pirates?

109
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,070
They appear to be.

110
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:33,640
Hey!

111
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,550
W-What's wrong, Luffy?

112
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,000
Nami!

113
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,900
Isn't that a Tone-dial?!

114
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,510
So that means they've been to a sky-island as well?

115
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,060
It seems like they aren't ordinary folks.

116
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,000
Doesn't matter who they are.

117
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:58,820
Nami.

118
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:04,180
They know how to use it.

119
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:11,370
A cyclone is approaching. Navigate your ship to 9 o'clock.

120
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,190
Navigation team...

121
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:16,730
No, sir. There's no indication of such a thing.

122
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,630
The reading on the barometer appears to be normal as well.

123
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,790
They are heading in the 9 o'clock direction.

124
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,110
It's coming fast!

125
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,390
Perm?

126
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,930
It's a freaking rain cloud!

127
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,540
Are you kidding me?

128
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,760
Shiki-sama, please direct our course to 9 o'clock!

129
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,790
It's a huge cyclone!

130
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:05,780
Shiki-sama! Please open the door, Shiki-sama!

131
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:35,450
Don't ever give me a false forecast again!

132
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,260
Yes, sir!

133
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:38,880
Nevertheless...

134
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:44,010
Who is this woman who posses the knowledge to outsmart my best and brightest navigators?

135
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:59,160
Just now, how did he come down here?

136
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,930
B-Beats me.

137
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:05,070
I'm Golden Lion Shiki, a pirate.

138
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,210
Anyway, whose voice was it in the tone-dial?

139
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,900
It was me.

140
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:19,930
So it's you, baby-chan. You have my gratitude.

141
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:20,990
No problem.

142
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:24,550
Um, old man, how's that thing floating?

143
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:30,250
Oh that? It's the result of Fuwa-Fuwa fruit.

144
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:30,250
Fluffy-Fluffy

145
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:35,890
I can negate the gravitational pull of things I touch and have full control over them.

146
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,720
Here goes.

147
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,290
Just watch.

148
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:41,390
What the?

149
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,000
Amazing!

150
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,290
Old man, make me float!

151
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:04,450
Me too!

152
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,080
I'm afraid not.

153
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:12,060
I can't levitate any other humans beside myself, nor animals, or any living beings.

154
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,480
What? That's lame.

155
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,050
Boo~ Boo~

156
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:19,730
Anyway, I'd like to thank you on my own turf.

157
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:23,200
It's gratitude for saving my life. You'll come, won't you?

158
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,240
Forget it.

159
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,190
We have to go to East Blue.

160
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:32,940
Luffy!

161
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,350
Hey you, what about adventure?

162
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,400
We have time to do that as much as we want later.

163
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:45,120
Can you sit still while the folks in our home-towns are in a pinch?

164
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,330
Well... That's...

165
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,730
It's decided.

166
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:50,850
Are you sure?

167
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,020
I-I see... You're right...

168
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,050
That's good.

169
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:02,240
That's how it is, so forget about it.

170
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,930
I'm starting to like you guys!

171
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:09,690
I see... East Blue is your home, eh?

172
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,190
You must be very worried.

173
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:16,530
Fine, I get it. I'll take you there with my ability.

174
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:18,420
Are you sure?

175
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,730
Thank you. Old man, you're a good guy!

176
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,940
But of course!

177
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:25,020
Can you actually do that?

178
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:30,140
Alright guys, prepare for battle!

179
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:33,030
You're too hasty!

180
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,980
We're up high!

181
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,760
It feels so good!

182
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,740
Are you guys even mentally prepared to fight?

183
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:07,140
Good grief, I wish they'd act a little more nervous.

184
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:09,000
You're one to talk!

185
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,390
I can see something!

186
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,300
This is amazing!

187
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,440
Are they also up here because of your ability?

188
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,850
That's right.

189
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,860
Once I levitate something, it stays levitated in the air.

190
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,370
That island is huge!

191
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:56,960
We're finally here.

192
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:58,460
Well then...

193
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,230
This is Merveille!

194
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:10,310
An island befitting adventure-lovers like you guys!

195
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:12,880
Play to your heart's content!

196
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,110
DOKUJA

197
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,110
Poisonous Snake

198
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,640
I've got your navigator!

199
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:28,200
Nami!

200
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,070
Luffy!

201
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,130
Guys!

202
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,180
Shiki-sama!

203
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:07,550
We have ourselves a newly evolved species.

204
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:10,320
Take a look.

205
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:13,550
A guitar?

206
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,250
It's a freaking bird!

207
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,700
You piece of shit!

208
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,780
Hey!

209
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,970
That's the evolution you mentioned?

210
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:33,270
Yes, it's the type with fortified electricity conduction.

211
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,060
What evolution?

212
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,890
I see...

213
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,700
I'm asking you to join us anyway, so I'll let you in on this.

214
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:53,170
Originally, this island was crawling with never-before-seen evolved animals.

215
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:57,210
And it's all thanks to a plant called "IQ."

216
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:04,560
It stimulates their brain and prompts them to evolve accordingly with their environment.

217
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:10,260
Knowing that, I collected every single IQ on this island.

218
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:17,640
We've been living on this island for 20 years, and finally, we've discovered a new kind of drug extracted from IQ!

219
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:20,600
We call it "SIQ."

220
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,780
Once we inject this into the animals, we can evolve their battle instinct.

221
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:29,420
If we continue to shoot them with this, we can invoke their atrocious nature.

222
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,170
That's why this island is swarming with these animals!

223
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:42,410
What a terrible thing to do. What is your goal?

224
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:45,530
You will know what my goal is...

225
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:48,030
If you become my nakama.

226
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,230
Like I said, I will never—

227
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:52,190
You will!

228
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:59,810
You will one day beg me to allow you to join.

229
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:05,260
Then, I will allow you to ask me anything you want once you've calmed down.

230
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:09,900
Because there's always something you'd want to request of your nakama, no?

231
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:18,530
"Give me this woman!" you said.

232
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:21,910
She's out of your league, you perverted gorilla!

233
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,460
What a surprise. For a moment, I thought you were my aunt.

234
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:28,270
Just how many branches of your family tree were made up of gorillas?!

235
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:40,530
They probably haven't gotten here yet because of the animals.

236
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:45,320
Nami-swan!

237
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,360
Quiet down.

238
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,350
A bug!

239
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,790
Robin-swan!

240
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:56,410
I said quiet dow—

241
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,200
A bird!

242
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,280
Nami-swan!

243
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,740
Why the hell are you wasting your energy?

244
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,650
Robin—

245
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:05,900
SHUT THE HELL UP, WILL YA!!!

246
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,680
I'm gonna fall! I'm gonna die!

247
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,130
That was close!

248
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:23,730
Up! Up! Up!

249
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:21,670
Huh?

250
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:24,380
Huh?

251
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,500
Sanji-kun!

252
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:59,640
Concasse

253
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:59,640
Crush

254
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:04,550
Damn cat.

255
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:14,030
Good job. Well done following my instruction!

256
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,690
What now?

257
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,590
Huh?

258
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:39,380
What the hell are these animals?

259
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:46,350
Give it a rest!

260
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,570
Thank God we made it.

261
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,750
Chopper, lend her your fur-coat.

262
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:07,240
You're right... It's pretty cold...

263
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,430
Like hell I could!

264
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,650
You're awake?

265
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,150
Huh?

266
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:26,230
What were you doing in such a place?

267
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:28,620
Um... Well...

268
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,550
That's...

269
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,820
Whatever, let's get out of here.

270
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:41,870
I've been in this place for a few days now, and I'm getting tired of it.

271
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:45,040
You should be able to get out of the snow in half a day.

272
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:46,510
What?!

273
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,720
Over there.

274
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,070
See?

275
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:00,580
Have we been travelling according to your instructions, Zoro?

276
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,640
It's just a coincidence.

277
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,200
My village is just across the river.

278
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,610
Thanks for saving me. My name is Xiao.

279
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:10,740
Zoro's the name.

280
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,130
My name is Tony Tony Chopper.

281
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:15,650
The gorilla just talked.

282
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:18,170
Don't faint!

283
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:40,310
This island is inhabited?

284
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,930
Have you noticed, Usopp?

285
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:50,820
Yeah...

286
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:53,210
This village, has no maidens.

287
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:55,220
This village, has no maidens.

288
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:56,150
That's what you've noticed?!

289
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:58,350
Are you awake?

290
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:02,290
I was surprised. You suddenly fell down from the sky.

291
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:04,160
I'm glad you're doing well.

292
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,900
Thank you.

293
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,500
Thank you, madam.

294
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,040
Come on, don't call me madam.

295
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:12,230
And those feathers on your arms?

296
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,480
You mean this?

297
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,540
For some reason, people from the village have these.

298
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,000
Heh...

299
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:22,930
Is this village short on food?

300
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,710
Everybody is skinny.

301
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:32,740
That's because all men and maidens are summoned to the royal palace.

302
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:36,680
The remainder are unable to work, so we just live to manage the day.

303
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:39,660
Why is that? It sounds horrible.

304
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:42,830
Well, if we oppose Shiki, it'd spell doom for us.

305
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:44,370
Shiki?!

306
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:48,720
That's right. He has complete control over us.

307
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,740
Furthermore...

308
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:51,460
Hide, you two!

309
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:53,960
Ouch!

310
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,600
What the hell are you doing?

311
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:05,660
It's huge! What is that?

312
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,440
It's the so-called self-propelled image-transmission den-den-mushi.

313
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:13,290
Any image captured is sent directly back to the royal palace.

314
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,190
We're constantly being watched.

315
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:22,700
If someone shows any signs of opposition, he or she will be killed immediately as a warning to the rest.

316
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,550
What's with it all of a sudden?

317
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:45,970
It's the smell.

318
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:49,690
The inside of my nose feels like it's getting shocked.

319
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:50,820
Can't you feel it?

320
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:53,150
It's the "Daft Green."

321
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:59,520
Our village is surrounded by a kind of plant called Daft Green. It protects us from the animals.

322
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:03,220
Animals hate their smell after all.

323
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:04,660
You bet.

324
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,010
Then cork your nose with something.

325
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,760
Let's go.

326
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:18,370
This is the plant?

327
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:22,800
I can still smell it with my nose corked.

328
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:26,740
Now that you mention, it sure stinks.

329
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,690
You're too slow!

330
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,400
Don't try to inhale too much; it's poisonous.

331
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,730
Say that earlier!

332
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:45,070
Didn't I tell you not to go out the border of Daft Green?!

333
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:49,780
But... All I wanted to do was to save Grandma...

334
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,390
Xiao...

335
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:58,850
Don't risk your life for me.

336
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:05,690
But... If you stay as you are... Grandma will...

337
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:11,580
Thank you very much... Guys...

338
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:14,020
I would like to repay you...

339
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:16,600
We just happened to bump into her.

340
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,860
That's right. She ended up helping us too.

341
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:22,320
More importantly, what's her illness?

342
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,030
It's an illness called Daft.

343
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,230
Any part of the body with the green lump gets stiffened up, and eventually the person will be unable to move.

344
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:35,240
It's the result of inhaling too much pollen from Daft Green.

345
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:44,050
The only cure can be made from a plant called IQ, but... We need more than just one.

346
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,770
That's why she ventured into that place alone.

347
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:48,560
I'm sorry.

348
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:52,020
It's not your fault.

349
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:55,640
The bad guy is Shiki who monopolized the IQ.

350
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:58,080
Shiki? Did you say Shiki?

351
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:06,300
20 years ago, humans, plants, and animals coexisted peacefully.

352
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:09,080
But that man ruined everything.

353
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:14,160
I wish they'd just leave... To the Sea of Stratagems...

354
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:24,320
Can't you do anything about that?

355
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,230
I've never seen this kind of illness before.

356
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:28,100
I don't want to make it worse.

357
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:34,030
Anyway, we won't get attacked by those animals as long as we stay here, right?

358
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:42,250
Yeah. I can still smell a little bit of Daft Green here, but at the very least, I can stand it.

359
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:45,920
But I wonder if everybody's alright.

360
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:48,270
Yeah, me too.

361
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:52,270
We'll start looking for them again after a quick rest.

362
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:58,450
I'm all worn out.

363
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:07,100
I feel weird... I can't move my body...

364
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,100
You're telling me.

365
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:13,410
We haven't had the slightest bit of good rest for a whole week!

366
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,260
What? It's just you...

367
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:25,940
Sanji! Usopp!

368
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:27,120
It looks like all captains have gathered at the port.

369
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:31,470
Okay, we'll make our move after the meeting.

370
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,680
Finally, tonight is the night?

371
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,900
Return all those men back to their village.

372
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,050
You sure about that?

373
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,880
I promised them after all.

374
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,940
But return just one of them...

375
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:49,310
It's only natural to give them hope before despair.

376
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:55,760
The expression of someone falling from a high place is exceptional, no?

377
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,580
Boss Shiki.

378
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,800
You could talk!

379
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:12,760
Bad news. That little girl has escaped.

380
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,570
What?

381
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:20,060
It seems like she's realized that the royal palace's pool is connected directly to the sea.

382
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:25,790
She got us, but we can't allow such a rare talent to escape.

383
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:28,930
Inform all networks. We must find her!

384
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:29,820
Yes, sir!

385
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:37,480
That hurts!

386
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:42,020
Geez...

387
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,120
Stop!

388
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:50,840
But you saved me... Thanks.

389
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:56,210
Anyway, where are we?

390
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:15,850
Sunny-go!

391
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,970
Oh, Sunny-go!

392
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,510
Luffy!

393
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:35,630
Nami!

394
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,220
I'm glad you're alright.

395
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,450
Good job running away from that guy.

396
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:50,420
Don't come over here!

397
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:13,230
Where's everybody?

398
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:17,020
This place is so big, I haven't been able to meet any of them yet.

399
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:20,200
But I didn't think I'd meet you first...

400
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:23,450
Anyway, let's eat, this scorpion is good.

401
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:24,740
Isn't that right, Biri?

402
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,400
No thank you.

403
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,340
Biri? Who?

404
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,940
shock

405
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,940
This bird, it's producing biri.

406
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:34,480
Right?

407
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:40,660
I see. You're a rubber-man, so electricity doesn't affect you.

408
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:49,360
Anyway, we found Sunny-go.

409
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:52,130
Should we wait for everyone? Or should we look for them?

410
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:53,670
We'll look for them!

411
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,200
crayfish

412
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,200
This Zarigani-san is amazing!

413
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:07,010
It's my custom design. Call it Zari Davidson.

414
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:07,860
Yes!

415
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:11,270
Zari Davidson! Zari Davidson!

416
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:15,790
I can see something.

417
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:17,020
A town?

418
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:17,990
I think so.

419
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,230
I bit my tongue... Though I have no tongue.

420
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:30,050
I told you not to jump backwards!

421
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,850
It's shaking.

422
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:34,590
It's no use. It won't listen to us.

423
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:37,130
Let's walk.

424
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,760
What's wrong?

425
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:00,700
It's a village.

426
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:07,980
I saw those kinds of trees around Shiki's royal palace too.

427
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:11,520
Do you dislike that smell?

428
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,720
Is that right?

429
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:23,490
I think the area surrounded by the trees is safe from those animals.

430
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:26,290
Then, the guys could be there...

431
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:31,570
I'm glad you're okay, Nami-san!

432
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:36,410
I was so worried about you that I haven't been able to sleep well.

433
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:42,320
He wasn't kidding about not being able to sleep.

434
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,690
We haven't found Robin-chwan yet!

435
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:46,510
You're noisy as hell!

436
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:47,360
Huh?!

437
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,680
Anyway, I'm just glad you're all okay.

438
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,040
There's even more people now.

439
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:59,450
Looks like you've gathered a crowd.

440
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:02,160
You can rest inside if you'd like.

441
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,620
Nami, go rest inside.

442
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:06,410
Eh? Okay...

443
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:10,430
Wake up, Xiao. Bring them some tea.

444
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:11,980
Yes.

445
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,150
We've found her, Shiki-sama.

446
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:18,060
Ah.

447
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:22,600
Then why don't I head off to welcome back our navigator.

448
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:43,280
They're not here.

449
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:48,350
On the other hand, why are there so many pirates gathered around here? Are they preparing for war?

450
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:55,280
From the Eternal-poses they are bearing, it looks like they were summoned here by someone.

451
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:04,020
Excuse me, would you show me your panties?

452
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:06,570
Like hell I would!

453
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,700
You arms...

454
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:15,330
Oh this? I think it's because we want to become birds.

455
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:19,240
Become birds? Do you think you can become one just because you want to?

456
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:20,350
Yes.

457
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:22,410
Um... Panties...

458
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:27,930
You guys are the Straw-Hat's mates, right?

459
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:27,930
Huh?

460
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:32,620
Are you guys here to seek alliance with Boss Shiki as well?

461
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:35,090
Yeah, that's what we intend to do.

462
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:40,280
Why has Boss Shiki gathered so many pirates for?

463
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:42,140
Why you ask?

464
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:46,260
Don't play dumb. Didn't you read the newspaper?

465
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:47,020
Here!

466
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:47,730
Huh?

467
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:48,860
That's...!

468
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:50,170
Eh?

469
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:04,410
Grandma, Mom, I have big news!

470
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:13,820
What did you say?

471
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:17,960
It's true! Shuu-chan's dad has returned home!

472
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:20,340
He said everybody will be able to return soon!

473
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:22,590
We'll be able to see Dad and Sister soon!

474
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:26,780
Are you sure? I'm not dreaming, am I?

475
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:28,100
In other words...

476
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:31,410
That's right. Shiki is leaving this place.

477
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:33,940
He's going to take all of the animals with him to the Sea of Stratagems.

478
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:35,900
To East Blue!

479
00:48:48,610 --> 00:48:50,040
I see...

480
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:54,230
East Blue is your home-town, eh?

481
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:56,780
You will know what my goal is.

482
00:48:57,210 --> 00:49:03,670
You will one day beg me to allow you to join.

483
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:08,250
Become my navigator, Baby-chan.

484
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:12,640
Because there's always something you'd want to request your nakama, no?

485
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:22,320
It feels like I'm dreaming when there's a hope for living after being here for so long.

486
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:23,140
You're right.

487
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:28,280
I wish they'd leave for East Blue even if it was a minute or a second earlier.

488
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:37,840
Luffy...

489
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,290
That's right.

490
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:47,970
That was a warning for the World Government.

491
00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:52,230
In other words, Boss Shiki's intention is...

492
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:56,540
Annihilate East Blue and then overturn the world!

493
00:49:56,540 --> 00:50:03,740
I heard that after tonight's meeting, he will send all those animals to East Blue.

494
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:08,500
If he did that, a lot of lives would be lost.

495
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:13,380
Don't mind all that. He's doing it in order to get the World Government to surrender.

496
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:16,300
We're following a great man.

497
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:17,870
You bet!

498
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,470
Come on, let's cheer!

499
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:23,070
Cheers!

500
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:28,190
Hey guys, don't think you can attend the meeting with your current outfits.

501
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:30,440
Wear something formal!

502
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,110
Follow the dress code, right? Got it.

503
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:39,660
I heard there's a demonstration for us tonight.

504
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,610
Demonstration?

505
00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:47,490
I heard he's going to destroy the only village on this island.

506
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:49,770
Actually, I can't wait to see it!

507
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:54,290
There's an inhabited village on this island?

508
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:01,160
Luffy?

509
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:03,810
Stay back, Nami!

510
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:21,710
I've found you, Baby-chan.

511
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:22,810
Shiki!

512
00:51:23,590 --> 00:51:26,910
You're cold, Baby-chan.

513
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:31,890
You left without a word. That hurts me deep.

514
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:34,310
Shut up, you shitty bastard.

515
00:51:34,310 --> 00:51:37,120
You fooled us and took Nami-san away.

516
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:44,170
It's hard not to snatch such an elegant woman away.

517
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:47,550
If you don't want me to take her away from you, then protect her properly!

518
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:54,530
Although, I don't think she's able to leave my side now.

519
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:58,490
Am I right, Baby-chan?

520
00:51:58,810 --> 00:52:00,690
Bastard!

521
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:01,690
Hey, Steering-wheel!

522
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:09,320
Don't think you can leave this place unscathed after hurting my nakama.

523
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:12,300
What are you going to do?

524
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:13,510
Beat the crap out of you!

525
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:15,900
Luffy!

526
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:21,590
If you could, I'd like to see you try!

527
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:26,630
Huh?

528
00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:29,670
Gomu Gomu No Kama

529
00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:29,670
Rubber Rubber Sickle

530
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:33,540
Hissatsu Hi No Tori Boshi

531
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:33,540

532
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:40,210

533
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:40,210

00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:43,300

Kokutei Rozeo Michieeri

536
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:47,250
Kokutei Roseo Metel

537
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:54,200
Poitrine Shoot

538
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:54,200
Breast Shoot

539
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:02,070
You make quite a good team.

540
00:53:02,070 --> 00:53:05,960
I've gotta say you're pretty good for making me use my hand.

541
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:11,420
But now that I've used my hand, don't expect me to hold back.

542
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:15,460
Sanji!

543
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:25,250
Let's start with you.

544
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:26,680
Sanji!

545
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:29,340
Rocket

546
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:40,020
Did I interrupt your conversation?

547
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:41,320
Not really...

548
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:56,160
To think you're able to fight on equal ground with me...

549
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:59,500
It's such a pain. I'll get rid of you all at once.

550
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:03,460
He's going to do something.

551
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:28,250
Shishi Odoshi

552
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:28,250
Menacing Lion

553
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:29,460
Chimaki

554
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:29,460
Winding Earth

555
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:44,710
Gomu Gomu No

556
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:44,710
Rubber Rubber

557
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:46,440
CANNON

558
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:51,340
Wow!

559
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:53,530
Cook!

560
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:55,150
Huh? Damn...

561
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:03,610
Armee de L'Air Power Shoot

562
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:03,610
Air Force Power Shoot

563
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:07,260
Hissatsu Atlas Suisei

564
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:07,260
Sure-kill Atlas Comet

565
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:10,140
Good aim, but it's useless.

566
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:14,510
Santouryuu Gyuuki Yuzume

567
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:14,510
Demon Bull's Brave Hoof

568
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:18,840
You don't even deserve to be killed.

569
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:21,610
Zoro!

570
00:55:24,410 --> 00:55:25,630
Damn!

571
00:55:29,290 --> 00:55:29,650
Gear

572
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:38,660
Luffy!

573
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:15,480
Guys!

574
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:20,750
I'll have them sleep in the earth for a while.

575
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:24,880
It's annoying when I have to deal with these ignorant fools.

576
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:31,390
Especially when you were about to comprehend the situation and return to me.

577
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:34,880
Am I right?

578
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:41,840
Was East Blue also your doing?

579
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:43,780
That's right.

580
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:48,130
Don't...

581
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:52,400
Don't do my nakama or my home-town any more harm than you already have!

582
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:55,920
You've got the order wrong.

583
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,700
I told you before.

584
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:00,650
There's always something you'd want to request from your nakama.

585
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:06,110
The only threatening thing to me is that cyclone.

586
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:12,980
You should know fully well that what I need is a talented navigator.

587
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,200
Is that a mirror?

588
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,730
Stop bullshitting.

589
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:26,680
This is the ring my sister from my home-town gave me when we parted.

590
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:37,760
If I join you, you'll spare East Blue, right?

591
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:44,630
Of course, I'm a man who values his nakama more than anything else.

592
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:49,360
I won't lay a single hand on my nakama's home-town.

593
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:55,270
Don't do anything stupid, Nami!

594
00:57:56,170 --> 00:57:57,170
Usopp!

595
00:57:57,660 --> 00:57:59,480
You're still conscious?

596
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:03,860
You're not gonna sell yourself out just because of our home-towns, are you?

597
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:10,520
Luffy won't forgive you if you do that!

598
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:14,500
What do you mean by won't forgive, brat?

599
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:19,520
Looks like you still haven't fully understood the situation you're in.

600
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:26,040
Wait, I understand the situation!

601
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,410
Don't harm my nakama!

602
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:34,010
Then let me hear you answer, Baby-chan.

603
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:39,070
Usopp, we have no other choice.

604
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:43,170
I will protect East Blue.

605
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:47,190
So put your mind at ease and just go.

606
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:48,180
No, Nami...

607
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:49,390
I'm gonna be okay.

608
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:50,000
Stop it!

609
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,620
I'll live no matter anywhere I go.

610
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:53,430
Shut up!

611
00:58:54,310 --> 00:58:55,600
Who'd agree if you—

612
00:59:01,570 --> 00:59:02,990
Usopp!

613
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:06,480
What an annoying brat, geez...

614
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:11,180
Well, Baby-chan, let me hear your answer.

615
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:20,440
I'll become your nakama.

616
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:25,350
Become, huh?

617
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:50,240
Please make me your nakama.

618
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,630
I see.

619
00:59:57,430 --> 01:00:00,820
Welcome, my excellent navigator.

620
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:05,980
Understanding that there are opponents you can't beat is also part of the learning process.

621
01:00:12,390 --> 01:00:15,210
I'm not a kidnapper.

622
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:18,830
Moral code is valued even in the pirate world.

623
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:25,280
Leave your nakama who have been through hard and happy times a final farewell.

624
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:02,260
Good farewell.

625
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:05,260
I hope this won't bring me any future trouble.

626
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:07,600
Your nakama should be able to accept it...

627
01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:12,780
If they are able to crawl out of there alive, that is.

628
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:37,120
Alright, get ready, everyone.

629
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:40,570
We shall commence as planned.

630
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,760
Welcome back.

631
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:10,880
Ah.

632
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:17,200
Hey, what're you doing? Come in here.

633
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:24,000
The more I look at you, the prettier you become.

634
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:27,380
Look...

635
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,370
You made a good decision.

636
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:35,540
You should be grateful that your home-town won't be part of this turmoil.

637
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:00,030
Hurry, to the underground trench!

638
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:19,610
Awesome, those animals are devouring the village!

639
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:23,350
As expected from Boss Shiki. He sure knows how to roll.

640
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:32,250
It's just a little side-show to see what happens if we remove Daft Green from the village.

641
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:40,530
I'm not interested...

642
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:42,930
I'm going back to my room.

643
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:53,620
Geez, I thought she would go into a frenzy.

644
01:04:57,070 --> 01:05:00,100
Damn it... We're late.

645
01:05:02,550 --> 01:05:04,830
It's identical to the photo in the newspaper.

646
01:05:04,830 --> 01:05:07,040
They sure did terrible things...

647
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:10,100
It won't be long before East Blue ends up like this.

648
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:16,870
Mugiwara, let me know if you're here!

649
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:20,250
Luffy-san, are you here?!

650
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:34,300
Mugiwara!

651
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:35,660
Luffy-san!

652
01:05:36,130 --> 01:05:37,700
What in the world happened?

653
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:39,440
Quick, get them out!

654
01:05:45,530 --> 01:05:49,060
Shiki was the one behind all the incidents in East Blue?

655
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:49,940
Yes.

656
01:05:52,110 --> 01:05:56,530
So he intends to use those beasts to turn our home-towns upside-down...

657
01:05:56,940 --> 01:06:00,410
Shitty bastard, treating others like fools...

658
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:06,120
In order to protect our home-towns, she left with Shiki.

659
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:09,880
We were saved by Nami.

660
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:16,110
Xiao, are you alright?

661
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:21,840
We were hiding in the underground trench.

662
01:06:22,410 --> 01:06:27,720
Anyway, what you guys were talking about... Is it true that East Blue is your home?

663
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:33,310
Is it also that girl's home?

664
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:35,770
Yeah, that's right.

665
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:40,110
What have I done?!

666
01:06:40,110 --> 01:06:46,370
I said I wished Shiki would just leave for East Blue in front of her!

667
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:50,220
How could I say such a terrible thing?!

668
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:52,210
I was happy, too...

669
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:58,230
Xiao, what's that?

670
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:04,110
This? I picked it up from here...

671
01:07:04,110 --> 01:07:05,990
Let me see.

672
01:07:05,990 --> 01:07:06,810
Sure.

673
01:07:11,150 --> 01:07:13,580
You're amazing, Xiao.

674
01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:18,990
You have time to worry about Nami when your own village is in such a mess.

675
01:07:18,990 --> 01:07:23,080
I've never seen people as kind as you guys are.

676
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:25,180
You don't have to blame yourself...

677
01:07:25,890 --> 01:07:27,960
The one at fault is that bastard Shiki.

678
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:30,560
I'll beat the hell out of him.

679
01:07:30,990 --> 01:07:32,870
Cheer up, 'kay?

680
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:40,340
What's that? A tone-dial?

681
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:42,810
Yeah, it's the one Shiki was using.

682
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:49,790
Please forgive me for being unable to say farewell to you all directly.

683
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:51,740
It's Nami's voice.

684
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:56,910
I've decided to join Shiki's crew as their navigator.

685
01:07:57,370 --> 01:08:03,850
Shiki is a legendary pirate whom Luffy and you guys can't oppose.

686
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:10,330
You will only be wasting your life if you come after me.

687
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:13,180
That's why I'll say this...

688
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:20,120
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?!!

689
01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:25,210
What's wrong with her?! Why is she leaving this kind of message?!

690
01:08:25,210 --> 01:08:26,000
C-Calm down...

691
01:08:26,670 --> 01:08:28,800
She said we can't beat him?!

692
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:31,260
What the hell was she thinking when she said all that?!

693
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:35,820
But in reality you all were beaten by him, weren't you?

694
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:39,910
What did you say? I was just... Doesn't really mean...

695
01:08:39,910 --> 01:08:43,370
Calm down... Stop...

696
01:08:45,220 --> 01:08:46,360
Damn...

697
01:08:52,410 --> 01:08:55,010
Usopp, let me hear it again.

698
01:08:58,750 --> 01:09:03,200
Please forgive me for being unable to say farewell to you all directly.

699
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:08,770
I've decided to join Shiki's crew as their navigator.

700
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:15,420
Shiki is a legendary pirate whom Luffy and you guys can't oppose.

701
01:09:16,410 --> 01:09:22,180
You will only be wasting your life if you come after me.

702
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:24,810
That's why I'll say this...

703
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:32,040
Our elites are gathering one after another...

704
01:10:33,010 --> 01:10:35,860
It's finally time, World-Government...

705
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:40,450
It's been 20 years since my legs last ached...

706
01:10:52,630 --> 01:10:53,560
I see...

707
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:54,840
I got it.

708
01:10:56,650 --> 01:10:57,470
I'll go now.

709
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:08,830
HE UNDERSTOOD?!!

710
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:31,260
I see...

711
01:11:31,650 --> 01:11:36,070
You plan on letting the animals attack this place by destroying these trees...

712
01:11:37,780 --> 01:11:42,050
You've planned this since the beginning, haven't you, Baby-chan?

713
01:11:43,610 --> 01:11:46,750
Despite all my effort complying with your conditions...

714
01:11:47,570 --> 01:11:52,310
There's no way you'd listen to me...

715
01:11:52,840 --> 01:12:00,530
I don't want to see my home-town in ruin nor my nakama depressed from hearing this bad news!

716
01:12:05,690 --> 01:12:08,110
Don't be so hasty...

717
01:12:18,330 --> 01:12:22,460
The powerful poison from these trees wasn't a part of your calculation, was it?

718
01:12:25,310 --> 01:12:29,510
Pirates should not be concerned about their family nor their home-town.

719
01:12:31,150 --> 01:12:37,310
You'll only be misplacing your life if you cling onto those things.

720
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:50,690
If you are unlucky enough to survive until the end of the meeting...

721
01:12:50,690 --> 01:12:54,290
I'll use you as my navigator for the rest of your life.

722
01:12:55,110 --> 01:12:57,740
I don't dislike cheeky women...

723
01:13:28,430 --> 01:13:30,640
Well done gathering here.

724
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:36,940
We shall now commence the Shiki alliance ceremony.

725
01:13:37,570 --> 01:13:42,210
First of all, I don't appreciate traitors. Keep that in mind.

726
01:13:43,170 --> 01:13:46,990
Well then, let's depart to the Sea of Stratagems.

727
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:50,080
To the tragic sea of East Blue!

728
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:21,860
Let's go, Franky.

729
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:22,870
Got it.

730
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:26,470
Hold on tight.

731
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:29,660
Coup de Burst

732
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:29,660
Burst Blow

733
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:21,370
For real?!

734
01:15:21,370 --> 01:15:23,640
How dare you dock your ship on the royal palace?!

735
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,460
Who the hell are you?!

736
01:15:36,610 --> 01:15:42,660
As you know, East Blue is the weakest among the five seas.

737
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:45,230
No one will mourn its demise.

738
01:15:45,550 --> 01:15:47,970
Do as you wish with it.

739
01:15:49,710 --> 01:15:52,480
The Golden Lion Pirates are complete!

740
01:15:56,620 --> 01:15:57,790
Shiki-sama!

741
01:15:59,890 --> 01:16:01,780
What do you want at a time like this?!

742
01:16:02,030 --> 01:16:05,550
My deepest apologies, but I have an emergency.

743
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:11,040
8 people? They are rushing in?

744
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:12,710
Well...

745
01:16:52,770 --> 01:16:53,440
What?

746
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:55,800
That's lame, man.

747
01:16:56,050 --> 01:16:57,110
This is how you do it.

748
01:16:57,110 --> 01:16:58,210
W-Wait a second!

749
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:33,570
It's you guys... What a surprise.

750
01:17:40,690 --> 01:17:43,070
I heard you're going to attack East Blue?

751
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,320
Well yeah.

752
01:17:49,870 --> 01:17:51,410
Is Nami alright?

753
01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:54,290
She's lively.

754
01:18:00,730 --> 01:18:07,570
You look tough, but don't think you can make a difference with just 8 people.

755
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:24,580
A stupid woman who believed that if she sacrificed herself, she would be able to protect her home-town...

756
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:28,590
Together with a reckless suicide squad.

757
01:18:29,070 --> 01:18:30,530
Are you stupid?

758
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:35,280
Nami didn't sacrifice herself.

759
01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:38,870
She came here as the vanguard!

760
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:46,590
Brace yourself, Golden Lion...

761
01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:49,900
We're the main force!

762
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:26,580
We're out of ammo...

763
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:29,820
There's a bunch of them left...

764
01:19:29,820 --> 01:19:32,360
We were just saying hi... That's about right...

765
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:35,190
Usopp! Chopper! Find Nami!

766
01:19:35,190 --> 01:19:36,260
Got it!

767
01:19:37,510 --> 01:19:41,630
Shoot these impudent fools! Kill them all!

768
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:49,150
Boss Shiki, please go inside.

769
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:49,830
Yeah.

770
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:57,050
Kill their boss!

771
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:02,880
Nemuri Uta Flanc

772
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:02,880
Lulluby Parry

773
01:20:08,730 --> 01:20:11,010
Did you do something...

774
01:20:13,890 --> 01:20:16,210
To my nakama?!

775
01:20:19,950 --> 01:20:21,340
Boss!

776
01:20:28,970 --> 01:20:30,850
Don't get in my captain's way!

777
01:20:34,990 --> 01:20:37,790
Didn't he tell you to clear the way?!

778
01:20:47,110 --> 01:20:48,410
Biri...

779
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:59,480
Did you do this?

780
01:21:01,730 --> 01:21:03,970
I have a favor to ask... Listen to me...

781
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:13,480
Please stay here and listen to what I have to say...

782
01:21:23,710 --> 01:21:25,110
Renpatsu Kaen Boshi

783
01:21:23,710 --> 01:21:25,110
Continuous Flame Star

784
01:21:33,870 --> 01:21:35,830
Chopper, can you trace her smell?

785
01:21:35,870 --> 01:21:36,840
It's no good.

786
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:40,710
I can't smell well when the air is filled with Daft Green.

787
01:21:41,180 --> 01:21:42,340
Damn it...

788
01:21:49,250 --> 01:21:51,920
There she is! She's over there!

789
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:12,580
Nami...

790
01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:16,670
Won't you take it with you?

791
01:22:21,970 --> 01:22:23,850
Have fun...

792
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:28,050
Don't worry... It's going to be okay...

793
01:22:28,050 --> 01:22:33,950
I won't allow our home-town to meet its end...

794
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:39,780
Just a little longer, Nami...

795
01:22:58,730 --> 01:23:00,970
We're okay somehow...

796
01:23:01,130 --> 01:23:01,980
Where's Nami?

797
01:23:03,070 --> 01:23:04,290
Nami!

798
01:23:05,150 --> 01:23:06,880
Nami! Hang in there!

799
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,740
Are you alright? I'll get you out of there.

800
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,660
This lump... It's just like Xiao's grandma...

801
01:23:11,660 --> 01:23:13,690
We have to get her treated.

802
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:21,060
This... This is...

803
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:21,820
Could it be...?

804
01:23:25,380 --> 01:23:27,570
We've got a lot on our hands already...

805
01:23:27,850 --> 01:23:30,030
Hurry and get Nami out of there...

806
01:23:37,910 --> 01:23:39,790
NO!!!

807
01:23:51,050 --> 01:23:52,100
What the...?

808
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:33,380
Hanauta sancho Yahaza Giri

809
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:33,380
Three-Verse Humming: Arrow-Notch Cut

810
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:56,640
How is she, Chopper?

811
01:24:57,010 --> 01:25:00,310
It was a close call. She's finally able to breathe again.

812
01:25:00,610 --> 01:25:02,530
We have to do something...

813
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:05,300
Biri...

814
01:25:09,190 --> 01:25:14,500
The only thing that can cure this disease is IQ, but I heard Shiki is the only one who has it...

815
01:25:14,670 --> 01:25:15,850
What did you say?

816
01:25:17,930 --> 01:25:19,850
Where exactly...?

817
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:28,410
Is Nami—

818
01:25:28,410 --> 01:25:29,890
She's okay...

819
01:25:31,730 --> 01:25:33,090
Shiki!

820
01:25:33,580 --> 01:25:36,350
You've done it now, little girl...

821
01:25:37,820 --> 01:25:40,500
It seems like you really want to die.

822
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:42,970
I don't need you any more!

823
01:25:43,730 --> 01:25:48,580
I'll make sure East Blue is destroyed no matter how hard you struggle.

824
01:25:56,180 --> 01:25:57,510
We're done for!

825
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:00,270
Shishi Odoshi Gosho Chimaki

826
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:00,270
Imperial Palace of Winding Earth

827
01:26:04,170 --> 01:26:05,770
Die in despair!

828
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:07,360
Damn it!

829
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:08,510
Damn it!

830
01:26:28,430 --> 01:26:29,790
Luffy!

831
01:26:30,150 --> 01:26:31,860
You still want to fight?

832
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:38,180
Nami, I'll beat that guy and we'll go back together.

833
01:26:39,390 --> 01:26:40,550
Luffy...

834
01:26:42,270 --> 01:26:44,790
Leave this place to me. Take Nami to safety.

835
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:45,930
Got it.

836
01:26:45,930 --> 01:26:46,900
Fight hard, Luffy.

837
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:52,650
It's death for you anywhere you go.

838
01:26:59,930 --> 01:27:03,830
You have no right to decide our fate!

839
01:27:04,550 --> 01:27:05,820
JET PISTOL

840
01:27:10,690 --> 01:27:12,590
Biri, give me a hand.

841
01:27:16,740 --> 01:27:19,820
I won't let you go to East Blue!

842
01:27:19,820 --> 01:27:21,550
You stupid brat...

843
01:27:22,300 --> 01:27:26,660
Don't expect me to go easy on any man from East Blue!

844
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:36,220
What is this place?

845
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:37,700
They're all IQ.

846
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:40,830
They are using moonlight to plant them...

847
01:27:41,780 --> 01:27:43,500
It's the smell of medicine...

848
01:27:52,190 --> 01:27:54,860
This is where the IQ research is carried out...

849
01:27:56,290 --> 01:27:58,010
Which one should I let her take?

850
01:28:01,260 --> 01:28:02,770
An enemy!

851
01:28:05,550 --> 01:28:07,890
He smells of medicine...

852
01:28:07,910 --> 01:28:09,160
Are you a scientist?

853
01:28:09,430 --> 01:28:12,120
Yeah, an excellent one at that.

854
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:13,540
Hand over the cure for Daft!

855
01:28:15,050 --> 01:28:17,380
Why should I give it to you, idiot?

856
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:21,730
This is what you want, right? I've always been carrying it with me for an emergency.

857
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:24,950
Well, that makes it simple.

858
01:28:27,340 --> 01:28:30,560
All I need to do is take it from that guy.

859
01:28:30,970 --> 01:28:34,420
Back off, I'll chop him to pieces.

860
01:28:34,470 --> 01:28:35,900
Zoro!

861
01:28:35,980 --> 01:28:38,380
Looks like you've chased me to this place as well.

862
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:42,550
Take care of him... We need the cure from him.

863
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:49,470
You're going to chop me? A pawn from East Blue?

864
01:28:49,750 --> 01:28:55,130
Furthermore, no one would give a damn about that sea even if we were to destroy it!

865
01:29:01,950 --> 01:29:03,970
Chemical Juggling

866
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:09,070
Ignite!

867
01:29:14,550 --> 01:29:15,990
I can't dodge...

868
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:19,940
Zoro!

869
01:29:20,030 --> 01:29:20,840
Are you alright?

870
01:29:22,420 --> 01:29:25,170
Feel the power of Chemical Juggling?

871
01:29:26,690 --> 01:29:29,680
I don't have time to juggle with you.

872
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:32,390
Mass Juggling

873
01:29:32,510 --> 01:29:33,400
Eat this!

874
01:29:36,830 --> 01:29:38,140
Zoro!

875
01:29:38,610 --> 01:29:40,850
He ate the whole thing!

876
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:49,190
Kiki Kyuutouryuu

877
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:49,190
Demon spirit nine sword style

878
01:29:50,970 --> 01:29:51,810
Ashura

879
01:29:50,970 --> 01:29:51,810
Asura

880
01:29:54,450 --> 01:29:57,450
If you were to be...

881
01:29:58,270 --> 01:29:59,290
Chemical

882
01:29:59,310 --> 01:30:01,560
Defeated by a pawn who was born in East Blue like me...

883
01:30:01,790 --> 01:30:03,180
Juggling

884
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:07,530
Ugui

885
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:07,530
Menacing Drill

886
01:30:15,940 --> 01:30:19,130
Then, what kind of pawn would you be?

887
01:30:19,810 --> 01:30:22,260
Zoro is super cool.

888
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:23,970
Is he invincible?

889
01:30:23,970 --> 01:30:24,870
Chopper!

890
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:29,560
It's the cure...

891
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:32,440
I'm heading back now... Take care of Nami.

892
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:33,720
Yeah!

893
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:33,720
Yeah!

894
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:35,200
That way, man!

895
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:47,460
As expected...

896
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:49,340
There's no end to them.

897
01:30:50,710 --> 01:30:51,500
Over there?

898
01:30:55,270 --> 01:30:56,520
That's...

899
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:07,290
Robin-chan!

900
01:31:09,710 --> 01:31:11,480
What?!

901
01:31:11,930 --> 01:31:14,750
You said you want to make Robin-chan your wife?

902
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:17,040
YOU PERVERTED GORILLA!

903
01:31:17,810 --> 01:31:19,880
He understands the gorilla's language?!

904
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:27,760
Just you wait, you shitty gorilla!

905
01:31:28,750 --> 01:31:31,180
How dare you harass a lady in front of me?!

906
01:31:34,390 --> 01:31:35,310
Outta the way!

907
01:31:36,380 --> 01:31:37,720
Robin-chan!

908
01:31:45,980 --> 01:31:49,150
You're biting off more than you can chew, man...

909
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:51,780
You want to conquer the sea?

910
01:31:52,610 --> 01:31:58,450
Do have any idea... how many ladies there are in East Blue?!

911
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:08,970
Diable Jambe

912
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:08,970
Devil's Leg

913
01:32:14,790 --> 01:32:16,350
Flanchet Shoot

914
01:32:14,790 --> 01:32:16,350
Belly Shot

915
01:32:35,670 --> 01:32:38,460
That's the taste of East Blue's love.

916
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:40,080
Shit! Robin-chan!

917
01:32:48,070 --> 01:32:50,330
Are you okay, mademoiselle?

918
01:32:50,910 --> 01:32:52,700
Yeah, thanks!

919
01:32:53,390 --> 01:32:55,590
Why the hell are you taking the best part?!

920
01:32:55,770 --> 01:32:56,510
I'll grate you whole, you shitty-

921
01:33:00,970 --> 01:33:03,950
I don't have any flesh for you to grate...

922
01:33:10,020 --> 01:33:11,450
Nami's safety is our priority...

923
01:33:11,700 --> 01:33:12,970
Usopp...

924
01:33:12,970 --> 01:33:13,880
You're right...

925
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:16,030
I can hear Chopper's voice, too...

926
01:33:18,950 --> 01:33:19,870
Where are we?

927
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:20,830
Nami.

928
01:33:21,510 --> 01:33:23,730
Thank god... You're awake.

929
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,770
The cure worked...

930
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:27,630
Did you come to save me...

931
01:33:27,860 --> 01:33:30,670
Of course... And we're not the only ones...

932
01:33:31,130 --> 01:33:36,340
Zoro, Sanji, Robin, Brook, Franky, and Luffy... We're all here.

933
01:33:40,470 --> 01:33:41,470
Thank you.

934
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:45,270
This isn't the time to cry.

935
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:47,270
I know.

936
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:51,010
If we don't beat Shiki, East Blue will...

937
01:33:56,350 --> 01:33:57,470
This is...

938
01:33:57,990 --> 01:33:58,850
Stop.

939
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,450
What's wrong, Nami?

940
01:34:02,020 --> 01:34:03,020
A storm is coming...

941
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:08,060
The pressure is dropping... There must be a big cloud nearby.

942
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:09,980
We're going back to the royal palace.

943
01:34:09,980 --> 01:34:12,050
Eh?

944
01:34:32,160 --> 01:34:33,600
Biri, are you alright?

945
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:44,530
About time we put an end to this.

946
01:34:45,420 --> 01:34:46,230
Zanpa

947
01:34:45,420 --> 01:34:46,230
Guillotine wave

948
01:35:12,030 --> 01:35:13,990
It's settled, kid...

949
01:35:17,070 --> 01:35:18,760
Navigation team to Shiki-sama...

950
01:35:18,860 --> 01:35:20,590
Navigation team to Shiki-sama...

951
01:35:21,100 --> 01:35:21,530
What?

952
01:35:22,020 --> 01:35:25,250
Please move the islands east... There's a storm coming!

953
01:35:25,890 --> 01:35:27,010
A storm?

954
01:35:33,330 --> 01:35:35,100
Was that good enough?

955
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:43,030
Nami, was that good?

956
01:35:43,250 --> 01:35:44,640
Yeah, that's enough.

957
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:48,980
But, are you sure we're going to be okay heading into a storm like that?

958
01:35:49,010 --> 01:35:50,140
No way we're gonna be.

959
01:35:50,360 --> 01:35:51,650
Eh?

960
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:58,400
But, we have no other choice.

961
01:36:10,540 --> 01:36:11,990
I guess that's good enough.

962
01:36:12,940 --> 01:36:13,700
Well then...

963
01:36:14,620 --> 01:36:18,390
This must be painful for a devil-fruit user.

964
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:25,990
Though you can't take back what you did to me... Nor can that young girl...

965
01:36:26,340 --> 01:36:30,500
Watch as she perishes in despair!

966
01:36:31,150 --> 01:36:31,670
Shishi

967
01:36:31,150 --> 01:36:31,670
Lion

968
01:36:33,430 --> 01:36:34,750
Senjindani

969
01:36:33,430 --> 01:36:34,750
Valley of a Thousand Cuts

970
01:36:55,940 --> 01:36:56,600
What's that?

971
01:36:57,500 --> 01:36:58,460
Perm?!

972
01:37:05,330 --> 01:37:06,080
What?!

973
01:37:06,410 --> 01:37:08,140
The beasts are running away.

974
01:37:08,670 --> 01:37:12,020
The storm! This island is heading into the storm!

975
01:37:12,020 --> 01:37:13,150
What did you say?!

976
01:37:14,030 --> 01:37:16,970
Guys, to the sea!

977
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:25,660
I've got a strange feeling about this weather.

978
01:37:32,250 --> 01:37:34,960
Those animals are victims as well.

979
01:37:34,980 --> 01:37:39,880
I won't forgive you for using this drug to turn them into monsters.

980
01:37:45,700 --> 01:37:49,810
Good grief, this is such a bone-breaking job.

981
01:37:50,770 --> 01:37:54,540
If they really broke, it would really spell doom for me.

982
01:38:05,620 --> 01:38:08,720
Biri, can you still fly?

983
01:38:21,290 --> 01:38:23,300
Let's go beat him up!

984
01:38:24,590 --> 01:38:26,610
Take me... to the sky!

985
01:38:26,610 --> 01:38:27,990
Take me... to the sky!

986
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:31,600
Huh?

987
01:38:37,770 --> 01:38:39,100
Imbecile...

988
01:38:39,490 --> 01:38:40,940
Shiki!

989
01:38:41,250 --> 01:38:42,130
Huh?

990
01:38:44,090 --> 01:38:46,820
Nami, don't be reckless!

991
01:38:49,290 --> 01:38:50,530
It's Nami!

992
01:38:51,730 --> 01:38:54,260
It's over... Everything...

993
01:38:54,440 --> 01:38:56,750
I've finished planting the bombs!

994
01:38:57,170 --> 01:38:59,630
Bombs, you said?

995
01:39:00,290 --> 01:39:01,590
That's right.

996
01:39:02,710 --> 01:39:05,020
Your factory, your palace, and this island.

997
01:39:05,020 --> 01:39:06,840
Not a thing will remain.

998
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:10,270
Your plan has failed!

999
01:39:11,230 --> 01:39:14,680
DON'T SCREW WITH ME!

1000
01:39:19,110 --> 01:39:20,580
Nami-san!

1001
01:39:22,420 --> 01:39:29,530
As if brats like you are able to destroy my carefully thought out 20 year plan!

1002
01:39:30,790 --> 01:39:32,050
Eat this!

1003
01:39:32,850 --> 01:39:35,380
Hissatsu Tenryuu Boshi

1004
01:39:32,850 --> 01:39:35,380
Sure-kill Heavenly Dragon Star

1005
01:39:37,390 --> 01:39:39,390
Die!

1006
01:39:44,820 --> 01:39:46,260
You're all bark!

1007
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:50,880
Biri, save Nami!

1008
01:39:55,570 --> 01:39:56,690
Nami-san!

1009
01:39:57,390 --> 01:39:58,080
How about me?

1010
01:40:02,270 --> 01:40:03,170
Biri!

1011
01:40:03,450 --> 01:40:05,390
Curse you!

1012
01:40:05,390 --> 01:40:07,930
Your opponent is me, Shiki!

1013
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:07,930
Huh?

1014
01:40:08,310 --> 01:40:09,350
Gear Third

1015
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:14,000
Hone Fuusen

1016
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:14,000
Bone Balloon

1017
01:40:16,710 --> 01:40:19,160
Everybody, hurry to Lion-chan!

1018
01:40:33,540 --> 01:40:34,710
What's that?

1019
01:40:37,030 --> 01:40:41,160
Sucker, get struck by lightning and fall!

1020
01:40:41,430 --> 01:40:43,650
You're the one who's gonna fall, Shiki!

1021
01:40:43,650 --> 01:40:44,100
Huh?

1022
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:48,280
I won't let you go to East Blue!

1023
01:40:56,040 --> 01:40:57,870
What an idiot!

1024
01:41:04,790 --> 01:41:05,500
Ouch...

1025
01:41:05,870 --> 01:41:07,200
That's...

1026
01:41:07,810 --> 01:41:09,920
Here it comes!

1027
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:14,160
Do it, Luffy!

1028
01:41:14,750 --> 01:41:19,600
I'm the man who controls the seas from the sky!

1029
01:41:19,750 --> 01:41:21,600
You won't get your wish with...

1030
01:41:22,070 --> 01:41:23,560
My nakama...

1031
01:41:25,050 --> 01:41:26,360
Or the seas...

1032
01:41:27,940 --> 01:41:32,170
'Cause I won't let you!

1033
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:36,780
Giganto Thor

1034
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:36,780
Giant Thor

1035
01:41:40,530 --> 01:41:42,850
AXE

1036
01:41:50,300 --> 01:41:56,050
Am I going to be stopped by another man from East Blue?

1037
01:41:57,040 --> 01:42:01,350
ROGER?!

1038
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:19,360
We're blasting off! Hold on tight!

1039
01:42:19,710 --> 01:42:21,700
Coup de Burst

1040
01:42:19,710 --> 01:42:21,700
Burst Blow

1041
01:42:27,910 --> 01:42:29,550
Luffy!

1042
01:42:27,910 --> 01:42:29,550
Luffy!

1043
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:30,970
Luffy-san!

1044
01:42:31,180 --> 01:42:32,160
Luffy...

1045
01:42:35,120 --> 01:42:35,990
Biri?

1046
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:37,900
Biri!

1047
01:43:00,910 --> 01:43:02,040
Luffy...

1048
01:43:16,170 --> 01:43:17,750
It's Luffy?

1049
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:18,340
Where is he?

1050
01:43:25,370 --> 01:43:26,980
Yeah!

1051
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:29,820
I'm glad he's okay.

1052
01:43:30,670 --> 01:43:32,400
Me too.

1053
01:43:32,510 --> 01:43:36,370
He did it! Now East Blue is safe!

1054
01:43:36,580 --> 01:43:39,410
But that figure is pretty lame.

1055
01:43:41,690 --> 01:43:42,200
Yeah.

1056
01:43:43,690 --> 01:43:44,870
Sure is.

1057
01:44:09,290 --> 01:44:10,250
Those are...

1058
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:16,150
Shiki's ability has dispersed...

1059
01:44:21,860 --> 01:44:23,380
What about Xiao and the others?

1060
01:44:23,540 --> 01:44:25,380
Check that out!

1061
01:44:41,610 --> 01:44:43,120
Thank God.

1062
01:44:44,390 --> 01:44:45,360
Nami?

1063
01:44:45,750 --> 01:44:46,980
Nami-san...

1064
01:44:46,210 --> 01:44:46,640
Hey!

1065
01:44:46,980 --> 01:44:47,610
Nami.

1066
01:44:47,610 --> 01:44:48,840
Hey, Nami.

1067
01:45:10,190 --> 01:45:12,800
The islands are falling!

1068
01:45:13,530 --> 01:45:15,890
Run! Get away from here!

1069
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:17,400
Hurry!

1070
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:06,040
I spotted Shiki.

1071
01:46:06,040 --> 01:46:07,410
It's the Golden Lion Shiki!

1072
01:46:07,410 --> 01:46:08,660
Capture him!

1073
01:46:15,770 --> 01:46:19,520
Don't tell me... They did all that?

1074
01:46:19,720 --> 01:46:22,500
The target is the Straw-Hat's crew!

1075
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:24,000
Prepare the cannons!

1076
01:46:24,020 --> 01:46:24,740
Yes, sir!

1077
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:39,210
Yes, it was the Straw-Hat's crew.

1078
01:46:39,910 --> 01:46:41,210
Mugiwara...

1079
01:46:41,500 --> 01:46:46,430
We're still investigating. We'll provide you the full details later.

1080
01:46:46,660 --> 01:46:49,390
I see. Okay.

1081
01:46:52,660 --> 01:46:56,740
So we didn't do anything, huh?

1082
01:47:02,240 --> 01:47:07,620
Well, it's good that you're recovering faster than I expected.

1083
01:47:07,620 --> 01:47:10,370
But don't push yourself too hard.

1084
01:47:10,620 --> 01:47:14,330
Don't worry. I just want to take a breather outside.

1085
01:47:14,510 --> 01:47:15,640
I see.

1086
01:47:15,790 --> 01:47:18,290
Then go. I'm sure everybody will be happy.

1087
01:47:34,470 --> 01:47:36,690
Guys, Nami's up.

1088
01:47:37,040 --> 01:47:37,610
What?

1089
01:47:37,910 --> 01:47:38,520
Huh?

1090
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:42,200
Nami-swan.

1091
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:43,820
Yo, are you all good?

1092
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:45,030
Yeah, I'm all good.

1093
01:47:45,250 --> 01:47:47,280
That's good.

1094
01:47:47,710 --> 01:47:49,550
Now that you're up...

1095
01:47:49,950 --> 01:47:52,020
Excuse me, Nami-san, would you mind—

1096
01:47:52,030 --> 01:47:52,620
Knock it off!

1097
01:47:56,590 --> 01:47:58,980
That was harsh.

1098
01:47:59,150 --> 01:48:00,230
Shut up!

1099
01:48:01,850 --> 01:48:02,940
Hey Nami!

1100
01:48:02,940 --> 01:48:03,640
Huh?

1101
01:48:03,810 --> 01:48:06,210
How do you explain this?

1102
01:48:06,340 --> 01:48:08,300
Wait, that's...

1103
01:48:08,450 --> 01:48:14,000
You said I couldn't beat Shiki and everybody's going to die... What a bunch of bullshit.

1104
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:19,190
It's true that he buried me, but that's only because I was hungry.

1105
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,110
That's because I thought...

1106
01:48:22,390 --> 01:48:24,090
I'm speechless.

1107
01:48:24,090 --> 01:48:28,120
I didn't think you couldn't trust me despite knowing each other for so long.

1108
01:48:28,120 --> 01:48:28,740
I'm disappointed.

1109
01:48:31,870 --> 01:48:34,640
Luffy, what are you talking about?

1110
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:37,280
What do you mean?

1111
01:48:37,410 --> 01:48:39,750
Maybe you didn't hear it?

1112
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:42,880
Nami was in a tough spot, you know.

1113
01:48:43,050 --> 01:48:46,380
That's what I thought too, but after I heard that...

1114
01:48:46,530 --> 01:48:48,140
Heard what?

1115
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:50,820
Geez, you're hopeless.

1116
01:48:51,390 --> 01:48:55,810
Though all I could hear was a love message...

1117
01:48:56,970 --> 01:49:01,080
That message was intended for the dumbest guy like you, too...

1118
01:49:01,170 --> 01:49:03,760
Why don't we hear it again?

1119
01:49:04,440 --> 01:49:05,960
Wait!

1120
01:49:05,960 --> 01:49:06,780
I see.

1121
01:49:07,060 --> 01:49:11,280
Knock it off! It's embarrassing!

1122
01:49:07,110 --> 01:49:11,470
Please forgive me for being unable to say farewell to you all directly.

1123
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:12,350
Quiet down.

1124
01:49:12,700 --> 01:49:16,110
It's over, so throw it away!

1125
01:49:12,870 --> 01:49:16,110
I've decided to join Shiki's crew as their—

1126
01:49:16,630 --> 01:49:17,660
Ah!

1127
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:20,450
Hey!

1128
01:49:20,450 --> 01:49:20,970
Huh?

1129
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:23,770
Don't throw it away. It's a precious dial.

1130
01:49:23,770 --> 01:49:25,160
We can still use it.

1131
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:26,920
Give it back.

1132
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:28,360
Nami, don't throw it away!

1133
01:49:29,050 --> 01:49:33,670
Please forgive me for being unable to say farewell to you all directly.

1134
01:49:29,790 --> 01:49:32,250
Wait!

1135
01:49:34,590 --> 01:49:38,810
I've decided to join Shiki's crew as their navigator.

1136
01:49:39,630 --> 01:49:45,910
Shiki is a legendary pirate whom Luffy and you guys can't oppose.

1137
01:49:50,650 --> 01:49:56,280
You will only be wasting your life if you come after me.

1138
01:50:05,190 --> 01:50:06,710
That's why I'll say this...

1139
01:50:10,550 --> 01:50:11,720
Definitely... Come to save me.

1140
01:50:11,720 --> 01:50:12,870
Definitely... Come to save me.

1141
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:21,570
Kuyandatte ato no matsuri

1142
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:21,570
悔やんだって後の祭り

1143
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:21,570
It's too late to mourn now...

1144
01:50:22,300 --> 01:50:27,610
Mou kinou ni te wo furou

1145
01:50:22,300 --> 01:50:27,610
もう昨日に手を振ろう

1146
01:50:22,300 --> 01:50:27,610
Wave goodbye to yesterday.

1147
01:50:30,450 --> 01:50:36,710
Saa tabitachi no toki wa ima

1148
01:50:30,450 --> 01:50:36,710
さあ旅立ちの時は今

1149
01:50:30,450 --> 01:50:36,710
Now it's time to embark.

1150
01:50:37,330 --> 01:50:45,510
Omotaku shizunda ikari wo age

1151
01:50:37,330 --> 01:50:45,510
重たく沈んだ碇を上げ

1152
01:50:37,330 --> 01:50:45,510
Raise the deep-sunken anchor.

1153
01:51:01,570 --> 01:51:06,760
CONGRATULATIONS! Ima mune ni takanaru FANFARE!

1154
01:51:01,570 --> 01:51:06,760
Congratulations!今胸に高鳴るFANFARE!

1155
01:51:01,570 --> 01:51:06,760
Congratulations! Our hearts beat fast to the fanfare!

1156
01:51:09,030 --> 01:51:14,460
Mou Gradation wa mugen de nou ni kamifubuki yo mae

1157
01:51:09,030 --> 01:51:14,460
もう Gradation は無限で脳に紙吹雪よ舞え

1158
01:51:09,030 --> 01:51:14,460
The confetti dances in the boundless gradation of our memory.

1159
01:51:15,410 --> 01:51:22,590
kakugo nakimono wa sare atedonai rurou no tabi

1160
01:51:15,410 --> 01:51:22,590
覚悟亡き者はされ当て所ない流浪のたび

1161
01:51:15,410 --> 01:51:22,590
Wandering in an aimless journey, we lose our resolution.

1162
01:51:23,120 --> 01:51:31,620
Nobody knows koukai no matsuro

1163
01:51:23,120 --> 01:51:31,620
Nobody knows 航海の末路

1164
01:51:23,120 --> 01:51:31,620
The end of a voyage that nobody knows.

1165
01:51:35,310 --> 01:51:42,170
Chotto matte to iwaretatte docchi ikunda to towaretatte

1166
01:51:35,310 --> 01:51:42,170
ちょっと待ってと言われたってどっち行くんだと問われたって

1167
01:51:35,310 --> 01:51:42,170
You ask me to wait and ask for my destination.

1168
01:51:42,190 --> 01:51:50,130
Kotae wa itsumo kaze no naka ni arundesutte

1169
01:51:42,190 --> 01:51:50,130
答えはいつも風の中にあるんですって

1170
01:51:42,190 --> 01:51:50,130
But the answer is always in the wind.

1171
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:57,330
Itsu no manika otona ni natte ukkarishite matomo ni natte

1172
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:57,330
いつの間にか大人になってうっかりして真面になって

1173
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:57,330
One day we'll grow up through our carelessness and our seriousness.

1174
01:51:57,330 --> 01:52:07,460
Ushinatta takaramono sagashi ni ikou

1175
01:51:57,330 --> 01:52:07,460
失った宝物探しに行こう

1176
01:51:57,330 --> 01:52:07,460
Let's search for the lost treasure.

1177
01:52:12,390 --> 01:52:18,730
Kuyandatte ato no matsuri

1178
01:52:12,390 --> 01:52:18,730
悔やんだって後の祭り

1179
01:52:12,390 --> 01:52:18,730
It's too late to mourn now...

1180
01:52:19,480 --> 01:52:24,860
Mou kinou ni te wo furou

1181
01:52:19,480 --> 01:52:24,860
もう昨日に手を振ろう

1182
01:52:19,480 --> 01:52:24,860
Wave goodbye to yesterday.

1183
01:52:27,580 --> 01:52:33,950
Saa tabitachi no toki wa ima

1184
01:52:27,580 --> 01:52:33,950
さあ旅立ちの時は今

1185
01:52:27,580 --> 01:52:33,950
Now is the time to embark...

1186
01:52:34,390 --> 01:52:45,460
Kaze wo yonde dekai ho wo hare

1187
01:52:34,390 --> 01:52:45,460
風を呼んでデカイ帆をはれ

1188
01:52:34,390 --> 01:52:45,460
Call forth the wind and raise a huge flag!

1189
01:52:57,830 --> 01:53:04,640
Chotto matte to iwaretatte docchi ikunda to towaretatte

1190
01:52:57,830 --> 01:53:04,640
ちょっと待ってと言われたってどっち行くんだと問われたって

1191
01:52:57,830 --> 01:53:04,640
You ask me to wait and ask for my destination.

1192
01:53:04,640 --> 01:53:12,820
Kotae wa itsumo kaze no naka ni arundeshitakke

1193
01:53:04,640 --> 01:53:12,820
答えはいつも風の中にあるんでしたっけ

1194
01:53:04,640 --> 01:53:12,820
Has the answer always been in the wind?

1195
01:53:12,820 --> 01:53:16,460
Kitto kyou mo anata no hitomi de

1196
01:53:12,820 --> 01:53:16,460
きっと今日も貴方の瞳で

1197
01:53:12,820 --> 01:53:16,460
Surely, today, in your eyes,

1198
01:53:16,480 --> 01:53:25,110
boku mo shiranai atarashii boku wa guruguru tabi wo shiteru

1199
01:53:16,480 --> 01:53:25,110
僕も知らない新しい僕はぐるぐる旅をしてる

1200
01:53:16,480 --> 01:53:25,110
A new me is embarking on an endless journey.

1201
01:53:27,830 --> 01:53:34,860
Itsuka dare mo ga otona ni natte chakkari shita otona ni natte

1202
01:53:27,830 --> 01:53:34,860
いつか誰もが大人になってちゃっかりした大人になって

1203
01:53:27,830 --> 01:53:34,860
One day we'll grow up...to be shrewd adults...

1204
01:53:34,890 --> 01:53:45,340
Ushinatta takaramono sagashi ni ikou

1205
01:53:34,890 --> 01:53:45,340
失った宝物探しに行こう

1206
01:53:34,890 --> 01:53:45,340
Let's search for the lost treasure!

1207
01:53:48,770 --> 01:53:51,810
Presented by INP-Fansubs.

1208
01:53:52,305 --> 01:54:52,666
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
