Are they on?

3
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,967
Yep. So, introduce yourself.

4
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,164
Okay. Hey, I'm Frank. How you doing?

5
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,649
Don't answer that. That's rhetorical.

6
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,162
Okay. Let's get you up to speed.

7
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,045
This is a story about the future.

8
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,964
And the future

9
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,004
<i>can be scary.</i>

10
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,241
<i>What?</i>

11
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,607
<i>Are you sure
you wanna go with "scary"?</i>

12
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,125
<i>Yes, I wanna go with scary.</i>

13
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,964
<i>- Okay.
- Okay.</i>

14
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,247
<i>The future can be scary.</i>

15
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,407
<i>Unstable governments,
overpopulation,</i>

16
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,728
<i>wars on every continent,</i>

17
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,169
<i>famine, water shortages,
environmental collapse...</i>

18
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,403
<i>And scientific breakthroughs,
wonder and beauty...</i>

19
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,524
Could you please just stop interrupting?

20
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,523
I will. Just try to be
a little more upbeat.

21
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,011
- "Upbeat"?
- Yeah, tell them what you like...

22
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,526
I can't tell them anything
if you keep interrupting me.

23
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,840
You're right. Sorry.

24
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,331
As I was saying...

25
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:02,281
<i>With every second
that ticks by, we get closer and closer...</i>

26
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,010
<i>I know. Tell them about when...</i>

27
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,401
<i>I can't tell them anything
until I tell them about this.</i>

28
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,807
<i>Then, can we please
just start somewhere else?</i>

29
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,201
Fine. Where would you like me to start?

30
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,523
Well, you keep saying the future
wasn't always this way, right?

31
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,682
It wasn't.
When I was a kid, the future was...

32
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,683
- Different, right?
- Yeah.

33
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,009
Okay, cool. Then, start there.

34
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,971
All right. Well, when I was a kid,
the future was different.

35
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,604
Flushing Meadows Corona Park,
World's Fair.

36
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,923
Don't forget your valuables
and enjoy the future.

37
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,049
Watch your step, kiddo.

38
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,082
- Hello, sir.
- May I help you?

39
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,881
My name is John Francis Walker.
I'm here to win the $50.

40
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,007
Is that so?

41
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,568
I took it apart because of
the nitrogen compartment.

42
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,291
Seeing as how the bus ride
was kind of bumpy

43
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,169
and you know nitro.

44
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,281
I could've used
a hydrogen peroxide-powered engine.

45
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,567
Bell Labs tested that
with their Rocket Belt

46
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,846
and I guess there were some issues

47
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,129
with maneuverability,
flight duration, and stuff.

48
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,401
It's a jet pack.

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,001
Obviously.

50
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,481
You made this yourself?

51
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,325
Athena, what are you doing here?

52
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,171
Did you or didn't you?

53
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,961
- What?
- Did you make this yourself?

54
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,081
Yeah.

55
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,647
Why?

56
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:25,606
I guess I got tired of waiting around
for someone else to do it for me.

57
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,566
Does it work?

58
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,091
Sure. Yeah.

59
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,367
Mostly.

60
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,807
Just doesn't really,
you know, technically...

61
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,130
...fly.

62
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,689
<i>But if it did, "You know,</i>

63
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,240
"technically fly,"
what would its purpose be?

64
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,448
How would your jet pack
make the world a better place?

65
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,201
Can't it just be fun?

66
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,489
Mr. Walker, please tell me
you can do better than "fun."

67
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,885
Anything's possible.

68
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,244
I don't know what that means.

69
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,640
If I was walking down the street,

70
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,451
and I saw some kid with
a jet pack fly over me,

71
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,363
I'd believe anything's possible.

72
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,805
I'd be inspired.

73
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,440
Doesn't that make
the world a better place?

74
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,125
Well, I suppose it would.

75
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,084
If it worked.

76
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,965
Unfortunately, it does not.

77
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,691
And if it doesn't work,
it has no purpose at all.

78
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,764
- Thank you for your time, Mr. Walker.
- But I can make it work!

79
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,170
That's the spirit.

80
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,847
Until then, young man, have fun.

81
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,849
Absolutely not.

82
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,246
- I like him.
- Athena, no.

83
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,884
What makes you
think you're gonna make this thing fly?

84
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,291
I'm optimistic.

85
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,124
- You're wasting your time.
- I'm not!

86
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,806
- Damn contraption.
- It's not a contraption!

87
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,167
- It doesn't work.
- I can make it work.

88
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,605
No, you can't!

89
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,489
I'm not giving up.

90
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,402
Don't turn around. Be cool.

91
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,125
What did I just tell you?

92
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,168
- Sorry.
- Stop talking.

93
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,685
Look over there. Five o'clock.

94
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,891
You know, on a clock?

95
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,850
Where the five is.

96
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,004
That way.

97
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,561
I'm going with them.

98
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,327
You count to 20, then follow us.
Don't get spotted.

99
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,806
Who are you?

100
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,564
I'm the future, Frank Walker.

101
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,086
Nice. Do you like it?

102
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,770
<i>Travel the globe
in Walt Disney's "it's a small world."</i>

103
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,127
<i>A salute to UNICEF
and children everywhere.</i>

104
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,247
Excuse me.

105
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,085
<i>It's the happiest cruise ever to set sail.</i>

106
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,005
Sorry. Excuse me.

107
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,889
Sorry, folks, you're gonna have
to wait for the next boat.

108
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,600
There'll be another boat
in just a minute.

109
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,680
Hello?

110
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,885
Hello?

111
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,691
Hello?

112
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,361
<i>Good afternoon.
Please step aboard the transport.</i>

113
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,889
<i>The site is active.</i>

114
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:57,129
<i>Please put on your head protection
in order to prevent significant injury.</i>

115
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,171
"Injury"?

116
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,161
<i>Transport will commence
in 10 seconds.</i>

117
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,281
Wait!

118
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,281
Wait!

119
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,646
<i>- Five...</i>
- Wait!

120
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,330
<i>- Four...</i>
- No!

121
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,811
<i>Three...</i>

<i>Two...</i>

<i>One...</i>

124
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,287
No, phases one and two took a...

125
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,328
Hey! That's mine!

126
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,364
Did you just fix it?

127
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,211
Hey!

128
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,649
Hey! There he is.

129
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,607
Hey!

130
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,087
Hey!

131
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,081
It works now.

132
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,207
So, what is this place?

133
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,681
<i>And then everything went to hell.</i>

134
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,970
<i>- Oh, boy.
- Well, it did.</i>

135
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,964
<i>So you gave them, like, one second
of blue skies and jet packs and hope...</i>

136
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,247
<i>It's important.
They need to know the stakes.</i>

137
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,130
<i>I think they can figure out
clocks counting down are bad.</i>

138
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,531
- Do you wanna tell the story?
- No, you're doing fine.

139
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,130
Because if you think
you can tell the story better,

140
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,407
I would absolutely love to hear you try.

141
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,363
- Really?
- Really.

142
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,767
I guess, technically,
I am more qualified.

143
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,731
Are you? How so?

144
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,489
Because, unlike you, I'm an optimist.

145
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,043
- Babe, you filming?
- It's video.

146
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,447
- I knew it!
- Are you videoing?

147
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,965
Okay. Go ahead, sweetie.

148
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,491
Do your thing, Casey.

149
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,483
That's Sirius.

150
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,562
That's Canopus.

151
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,483
That's Arcturus.

152
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,164
Rigil Kentaurus.

153
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:32,406
Vega, Procyon, Capella, Betelgeuse.

154
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,086
And why do you love
the stars so much, Casey?

155
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,849
Because I wanna go there.

156
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,604
But it's so far away.

157
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,842
It'll take a long time. A real long time.

158
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,208
What if you get all the way up there,
and there's nothing?

159
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,611
What if there's everything?

160
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,045
<i>- Oh, boy.
- What?</i>

161
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,724
<i>Are you gonna go through
your entire childhood?</i>

162
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,121
<i>You started when you were a kid.
I'm just giving them context.</i>

163
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,009
<i>Just move it along. Okay?
They don't have all day.</i>

164
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,167
<i>Cool. You got it.</i>

165
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,845
Identify yourself!

166
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,160
Nate!

167
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,641
If you wake up Dad, I will crush you.

168
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,963
You shouldn't sneak out.

169
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,481
Well, you shouldn't still need a wubby.

170
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,882
Dad says it's okay to sleep with.

171
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,247
That's because
he doesn't want you to grow up.

172
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,849
Were you at the platform again?

173
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,923
What do you do out there?

174
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,130
Are you trying to stop them
from taking it down?

175
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,370
That would make me a criminal.

176
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,647
And a pretty terrible role model

177
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,802
to impressionable youth
such as yourself.

178
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,610
But if someone else did it,

179
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,564
I'd have to assume they believed

180
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:50,369
even the teeniest of actions
could change the future.

181
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,409
How can you be sure?

182
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,161
Because I know how things work.

183
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,002
Why are they taking the platform down?

184
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,730
Because it's hard to have ideas
and easy to give up.

185
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,766
But you won't. Right?

186
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,685
Never.

187
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,682
Hey, Dad. Heading to school.

188
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,570
- I made you lunch.
- Hey!

189
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,085
Wrap it up.

190
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,320
- How did you do...
- You would have gotten it.

191
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,241
Yeah, Eddie Newton.

192
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,411
What?

193
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,569
All three cranes?

194
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,522
All right, Douglas.
Thanks for the call. Bye.

195
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,681
Everything okay?

196
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,842
Yeah, the equipment over
at Canaveral is down again.

197
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,128
- Weird.
- Really weird.

198
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,045
Well, at least you get the day off.

199
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,327
Actually, they're bringing in
replacement cranes from Orlando,

200
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,607
so I will be back to work by noon.

201
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,840
That's fantastic.

202
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,968
- Case.
- Yeah?

203
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,441
Nothing's gonna stop them
from taking down that platform.

204
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,123
Nothing. And when we're done,
I'm out of a job.

205
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,762
There's nothing anyone can do about it.
It's inevitable.

206
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,128
Well, then you'll find something else.
You're a NASA engineer.

207
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,643
With nothing to launch.

208
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,922
- There are two wolves.
- Case.

209
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,971
You told me this story my entire life,
and now I'm telling you.

210
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,168
There are two wolves,
and they're always fighting.

211
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,802
One is darkness and despair.

212
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,006
The other is light and hope.

213
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,607
Which wolf wins?

214
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,965
Come on, Case.

215
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,441
Okay. Fine, don't answer.

216
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,171
Whichever one you feed.

217
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,206
Good.

218
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,001
Eat.

219
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,646
Come on.

220
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,441
Mutually assured destruction.

221
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:53,447
Today, any nuclear country or terrorist
is capable of inflicting damage

222
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,683
on a massive scale with weapons of...

223
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,769
Environmental entropy.

224
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,764
The polar ice caps
aren't waiting for us to decide

225
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,922
if climate change is real.

226
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,209
Rising coastal waters,
intensifying weather patterns.

227
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,204
They're all punching
our one-way ticket to...

228
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:14,046
Dystopia. By definition, "not perfect."

229
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,202
Huxley's <i>Brave New World,</i>

230
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,567
Bradbury's <i>Fahrenheit 451,</i>

231
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,246
Orwell's <i>1984.</i>

232
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,721
Once considered fiction,
these futuristic novels

233
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,644
are actually happening right now
and they seem to be getting worse.

234
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,881
Yes, Miss Newton?

235
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,485
Can we fix it?

236
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,441
Sorry?

237
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:35,849
I get things are bad.
But what are we doing to fix it?

238
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,242
Have a good weekend, everybody.

239
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,331
- Newton?
- Yeah.

240
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,528
You made bail.
Motorcycle is in impound.

241
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,046
You can pick up
your personal effects over there.

242
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,884
- Newton?
- Yeah.

243
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,407
All right.

244
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,605
All right.

245
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,651
Okay, one money clip, $47.32,

246
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,525
one Florida state driver's license,
one baseball cap.

247
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,603
You got one pin,

248
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,682
one pack of Beemans gum,
and I don't know what this is.

249
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,444
Sign here.

250
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,801
- That's not mine.
- What's not yours?

251
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,211
The pin. I've never...

252
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,842
No way.

253
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,010
Have I been here the whole time?

254
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,521
I know.

255
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,561
No!

256
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,041
I got it.

257
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,324
You have no idea
of the strings I had to pull

258
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,801
to keep Homeland Security
from pressing charges, Casey.

259
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,161
This is not just vandalism. All right?

260
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,767
- It's NASA. It's government property.
- Have you ever seen this before?

261
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,330
You're not getting it, are you?
I am very upset with you!

262
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,880
I get it, you're angry. I understand.

263
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,040
But I just need you to look at it.
Does it look weird?

264
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,206
- Don't touch it!
- Why are you yelling at me?

265
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,761
Not while you're driving, Dad.
It's dangerous.

266
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,410
Just pull over.

267
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,087
Pull over.

268
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,522
I swear to God, Case,
if you're on drugs...

269
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,251
I'm not on drugs. Just look.

270
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,369
I need you to be NASA Dad now.

271
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,364
New Frontier Dad. Okay?

272
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,124
All will be explained
as soon as you touch this pin.

273
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,241
What is...

274
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,490
It's not working?

275
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,721
You're not seeing this?

276
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,961
Stop it.

277
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,447
Honestly, Casey,
I don't know what's gotten into you.

278
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,369
Middle of the night...

279
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,481
- A little help, guys?
- Zen move, Dexter.

280
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,891
Totally swift.

281
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,843
Come on, idiots.
We're gonna be late for R and D.

282
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:54,366
<i>The HoverRail will be
arriving in one minute.</i>

283
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,044
- Are you coming?
- You can see me?

284
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,009
We don't have all day.

285
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,571
Wait for us!

286
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,451
<i>Northbound line now departing.</i>

287
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,287
<i>Next stop, Spaceport.</i>

288
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,962
Wow! Look at the rings!

289
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,163
Wow! Cool!

290
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,561
Be sure to follow the procedures strictly.

291
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,369
You know how you need your sleep.

292
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,010
Dad, you're embarrassing me.

293
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,163
- Do you promise to transmit every day?
- Even when you're out of range.

294
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,608
Come on, what's the big deal?
We're only going 20 light-years out.

295
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,767
<i>Now arriving, Spaceport.</i>

296
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,371
Come on, please.

297
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,041
I'll be okay.

298
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,440
Hey, guys. Over here.

299
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,686
- Hey!
- Hey!

300
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:32,567
Come on, please! I love you guys.

301
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,803
You're going to make me cry in
front of my friends, okay?

302
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,724
Bye! Bye!

303
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,211
Come on. We saved a seat just for you.

304
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,161
Now you run out of power?

305
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,166
- Nate, wake up!
- I didn't do it!

306
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,520
Dad changed
the password to his computer.

307
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,931
Do you know it?

308
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,169
You smell like swamp.

309
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,129
Tell me the password
and you can go back to sleep.

310
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,690
Your phone has Internet.

311
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,131
- My phone got soaked in a lagoon.
- Fine.

312
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,282
What are we looking for?

313
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,242
Here we go.

314
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,727

00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,568
I told you I was going camping with
friends, and I will call tomorrow.

325
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,530
- Can you do that for me?
- Only if you tell me what's going on.

326
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,883
I think that I saw...

327
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,966
That I went to the future.

328
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,560
Can I come, too?

329
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,202
Not yet.

330
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,087
Hello! Is Casey Newton home?

331
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,166
No.

332
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,448
She ordered some cookies
and I'm delivering them.

333
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,210
- You're a Girl Scout?
- Of course I am.

334
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,284
- Why aren't you wearing a uniform?
- It's at the cleaners.

335
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,488
Those are Oreos.

336
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,882
Could you please tell me
when Casey will be back?

337
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,765
She went camping with some friends.

338
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,888
She's gonna be gone
for a couple of days.

339
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,321
Is that what you've told your parents?

340
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,489
- Yeah.
- But it's not true.

341
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,882
- Yeah, it is.
- No, Nathan. It's not.

342
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,449
Don't ask me how I know your name.

343
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:40,047
I know it the same way
I know that you are lying to me.

344
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,049
Are you from the future?

345
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,004
You clearly understand.

346
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,246
So why aren't you
telling me what I need to know?

347
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,770
That pin thing, it stopped working.

348
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,729
She went to find another one.

349
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,246
Nathan, where is she looking?

350
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:10,168
<i>That's one small step for man,
one giant leap for mankind.</i>

351
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,126
Hello?

352
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,766
Sale this week.
Front three shelves. 70% off.

353
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,047
No, thanks.
I'm not here to buy anything.

354
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,321
I was hoping that
you could tell me about this.

355
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,927
Hugo!

356
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,686
Hugo!

357
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,127
One second.

358
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,043
Welcome to Blast From The...

359
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,606
Thank you for the help, dear.

360
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,364
Well, if you just kept it open,
you wouldn't need my help.

361
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,442
If I kept it open, it would ruin the effect,
which is everything.

362
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,409
Pardon my wife.
She has no respect for showmanship.

363
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,006
- Hugo Gernsback. How may I help you?
- She has a pin.

364
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,169
She has a pin.

365
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,130
I saw that you were
looking for one online...

366
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,931
- Where did you get it?
- What can you tell me about it?

367
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,526
I can't tell you anything about it
unless you tell me who gave it to you.

368
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,971
I'm not going first.

369
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,001
Well, it seems
our business here is done.

370
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,085
It seems it is.

371
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,289
Saw something, didn't you?

372
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,529
When you touched it.

373
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,368
Something incredible.

374
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,761
- It's real?
- Of course it is.

375
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,211
Don't ask me how.

376
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,840
These people have
developed technologies

377
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,564
we haven't even dreamed of yet.

378
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,161
Wait. What people?

379
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,891
Have you ever wondered
what would happen

380
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,760
if all the geniuses,
the artists, the scientists,

381
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:08,640
the smartest,
most creative people in the world,

382
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,564
decided to actually change it?

383
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,405
But where?

384
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,849
Where could they
even do such a thing?

385
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,367
They'd need a place
free from politics and bureaucracy,

386
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,807
distractions, greed.

387
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,202
A secret place where they could build

388
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,045
whatever they were
crazy enough to imagine.

389
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:32,170
"Plus Ultra" they call themselves.

390
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:36,404
The only way to see it, however,
is through contact with one of these.

391
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,244
Why did they make them?
What are they for?

392
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,965
Rumor has it

393
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,122
- they were about to go public.
- Yeah.

394
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,681
Share what they had built
with the whole world.

395
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,923
Unfortunately, that never happened.

396
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,321
Why not?

397
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,970
I think we've shared enough,
young lady.

398
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:01,001
So, as we've decided to trust you,

399
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:05,648
please trust us
and tell me where'd you get it?

400
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,721
I don't know.

401
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,851
What do you mean, honey?

402
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,762
I kind of got arrested
and it was in with my stuff.

403
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,727
- In with your stuff?
- Yeah, I don't know how it got there.

404
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,486
What was that?

405
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:27,366
- Tell us who gave it to you. Please.
- No one gave it to me!

406
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,203
That's very unlikely, sweetheart.

407
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,371
You know what?

408
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,283
I think I'm gonna go now.
Thanks for your help.

409
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,287
$1,000 if you tell me
where you acquired the pin.

410
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,407
I don't know!

411
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,482
- $10,000.
- Was it a girl? A little girl?

412
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,369
I don't know
what you guys are talking about.

413
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,408
Have a nice day. Enjoy your freak out.

414
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,921
Tell us where she is
and you will be spared.

415
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,445
This is a joke, right?

416
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,971
Where's the girl?

417
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,487
I don't... I don't know about...

418
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:42,166
You will tell us about the girl.

419
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,005
I don't know any girl. I told you...

420
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,923
- Where is the girl?
- I don't know any girl!

421
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,041
We have to go!

422
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,650
Come on. Now!

423
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:10,691
This is a time bomb.
It stops time, but not for long!

424
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,041
- What?
- Listen to me.

425
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,647
The sphere is collapsing
and you're in the line of fire.

426
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,849
We need to go or you will die.

427
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,605
I'm stuck!

428
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,885
- I'm stuck!
- But only temporarily.

429
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,328
Take my hand. The moment you're free,
I'll pull you clear.

430
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,845
Then stay behind me.

431
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,207
Ready?

432
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,281
The girl.

433
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:31,841
Look out!

434
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,361
We have to go.

435
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,845
They're about to self-destruct.
We have to go now!

436
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,288
Crazy enough to imagine.
Crazy enough to imagine.

437
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:04,766
Casey, get up.

438
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,005
They'll be coming.

439
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,889
What? Who?

440
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:14,121
- I don't know what... I can't get into...
- I know, I know.

441
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,850
Get in the car, Casey!

442
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,010
How do you know my name?

443
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,044
Just get in the car.

444
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,761
What just happened?

445
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:39,320
Two AA units targeted you
for extermination.

446
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,807
I saved your life. They self-destructed.

447
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:42,881
Wait. "AAs"?

448
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,680
Audio-Animatronics.

449
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:48,890
- They were robots?
- No. Advanced anthropomo...

450
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:54,291
Sure. Okay. Robots.

451
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,929
Wait, wait. Who are you?

452
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,207
My name is Athena.
I'm the one who gave you the pin.

453
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,648
The pin? The pin!

454
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:06,207
Yes. And I do wish you hadn't run off

455
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:09,284
before I had a chance to give you
some rather necessary context.

456
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,727
Context? What are you
even talking about?

457
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,485
How are you driving a car?
Who are you?

458
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,763
<i>I'm a cruder.</i>

459
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:21,165
<i>Re... I'm a recruton.</i>

460
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,209
<i>60 seconds to self-destruct.</i>

461
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,043
So sorry about that.

462
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:42,524
- You're one of them?
- Obviously.

463
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,881
Where are you going?
Stop! I'm trying to help you!

464
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,730
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

465
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,247
Hey!

466
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:18,687
Hey!

467
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,563
This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.

468
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,970
No way!

469
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,565
- Let me out of this car!
- Stop yelling!

470
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:53,251
- Let me out now!
- No! I will not!

471
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,687
I gave you my very last pin, young lady,

472
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,842
and I am not about to let it go to waste.

473
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,367
What do you mean your last pin?

474
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:06,530
Wait, that place I saw...

475
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,970
- It exists?
- Of course it does.

476
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,361
But if you don't come with me,
it won't for much longer.

477
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,041
Why not?

478
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,040
Because they built something
they shouldn't have.

479
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,929
Built what?

480
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,924
Do you want to keep
asking me questions

481
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,731
- until someone arrives to murder us?
- No.

482
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:31,607
Then which way do you want to go?

483
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,201
Backwards or forwards?

484
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,251
- And you can take me there?
- I can.

485
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,001
I'm driving.

486
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,884
Okie-dokie.
You fellas are released. Thanks.

487
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,965
Alrighty, boys.

488
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,843
Fire chief says
we're clear to go in and poke around.

489
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,331
Hopefully, they were out for lunch

490
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,482
and nobody was in
there when she went boom.

491
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,727
Captain.

492
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:11,051
Afternoon, sir.
Dave Clark, Secret Service.

493
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,522
Looks like you got
yourself a doozy here.

494
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,331
Secret Service?
Hey, where are they going?

495
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,600
They're securing the premises.

496
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,928
Thanks so much for your help,
but we're going to take it from here.

497
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,563
Hey, Dale.
I found this just outside the window.

498
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,889
You ever seen anything like it?

499
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,885
What the hell?

500
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:36,806
God almighty!

501
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,645
<i>Sale. This week. 70 perce...</i>

502
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:43,447
<i>Was it a girl? A little girl?
Was it a girl? A little girl?</i>

503
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,641
You wanna tell me
what's going on here, son?

504
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:49,961
No, sir. I do not.

505
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,650
<i>Was it a girl? A little girl?</i>

506
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,924
Contact Governor Nix.

507
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:01,970
Tell him we found the girl.

508
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:03,641
Veer left!

509
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,128
Little more of a heads up next time.

510
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,760
Hey, here's an idea. Why don't you
just tell me where we're going?

511
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:12,844
- Pittsfield, New York.
- What's in Pittsfield, New York?

512
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:14,971
Someone who can get us back in.

513
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,444
Hold on.
You said that you gave me your last pin.

514
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,329
How many other people
did you give them to?

515
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,401
Not important.

516
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,645
I'm not even your first choice.

517
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,522
I only found you
a month ago when you started

518
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,847
wantonly destroying
government property.

519
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,001
Which happens to go

520
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,844
on my search parameters
for recruitment.

521
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:36,969
Not to mention you scored a 73
on the Feynman/Drummelberg scale.

522
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,725
73? Is that good?

523
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:42,281
Wait. Hold on. Recruitment for what?

524
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,805
I'm not allowed to answer that.

525
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,166
Who's not allowing you?

526
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,607
I'm not allowed to answer that.
And I should warn you,

527
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:51,241
you keep asking me questions, and my
Countermeasure Protocol will initiate.

528
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:55,086
- Okay. And what does that mean?
- I will shut down.

529
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:58,524
- You will not.
- Try me.

530
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:05,847
You said that they built
something they shouldn't have.

531
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,764
Did something happen over there?
Something bad?

532
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,287
Son of a...

533
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,402
Please don't answer.
Please don't answer.

534
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:33,482
<i>Hey, you've reached
Eddie Newton's cell phone.</i>

535
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:36,086
<i>Leave me a message
and I will call you back.</i>

536
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:38,923
Hey, Dad. It's Casey.

537
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:43,923
I told Nate to tell you that I was
camping, but I'm not camping.

538
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,048
And I just don't like lying to you.

539
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:50,050
But I didn't know
how to tell you the truth because...

540
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:56,286
Something highly unusual
is happening, and...

541
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:58,890
Okay. My point is...

542
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,730
<i>I'm fine. I will continue to be fine.</i>

543
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,288
<i>I'm not on drugs. I haven't joined a cult.</i>

544
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:07,726
<i>I won't be gone long.</i>

545
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:12,480
<i>And I will call again soon.
I love you, Dad.</i>

546
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,731
Oh, my God! Are you okay?

547
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,968
Yes. Fine, thank you.

548
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,286
I thought I broke you or something.

549
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,121
I should drive.

550
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:36,802
Casey, I know you have
no reason to trust me.

551
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,487
But I've been looking for someone
like you for a very long time.

552
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,441
Now, please,

553
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,441
pull over.

554
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,930
Of all the people
you could give one of those pins to,

555
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:02,681
Why me?

556
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,845
Because you're special.

557
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:09,206
- Yeah. I'm special.
- You are.

558
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,922
So, this guy we're gonna go see,

559
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:23,130
what's his name?

560
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,011
His name is Frank.

561
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,403
<i>Frank Walker.</i>

562
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,210
He's special, too.

563
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,407
Frank Walker.

564
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:06,324
Hey! Wait, what are you doing?

565
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,890
Just great.

566
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,724
Where are your paw prints?

567
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,167
That is cool.

568
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,762
I can hear you, you know.

569
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:15,366
Go away. Didn't you see the dog?

570
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:18,207
Yeah. It's a hologram.

571
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:20,282
How did you do that in daylight?

572
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,763
- It's pretty impressive.
- Who are you?

573
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,205
What do you want?

574
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:26,203
You're Frank Walker, right?

575
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:31,091
My name's Casey,
and I want you to take me there.

576
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,888
Take you where?

577
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,520
To the place I saw when I touched this.

578
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:54,846
Where'd you get this?

579
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:58,247
A little girl. Athena.

580
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,086
Where is she?

581
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,891
She ditched me here.

582
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,325
Of course she did.

583
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,722
Look, wherever you came from, kid,
go back.

584
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,891
No, I want you to take me there.
What I saw...

585
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,247
What you saw is gone.

586
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:18,284
This, what you're looking for,
it doesn't exist anymore.

587
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:22,365
No. I feel like I have to go.
Like I'm supposed to go.

588
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:23,680
Why?

589
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,003
Because they're saving
a seat on the rocket ship just for you?

590
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:32,687
What you saw was a commercial
that was recorded decades ago.

591
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:36,686
It was an invitation that never went out
because the damn party got canceled.

592
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:39,847
You are not supposed to do anything.

593
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:44,365
You've been manipulated to feel
like you're part of something incredible.

594
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:46,531
Like you were special.

595
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:48,446
But you weren't.

596
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,321
You're not.

597
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,441
So that's a no?

598
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,087
Son of a...

599
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,331
You little...

600
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,887
<i>You know, I can call the cops anytime.</i>

601
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,240
Anytime!

602
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,765
You have...
I'm giving you five seconds...

603
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:08,922
I am not leaving!

604
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,367
Either tell me how to
get there or kill me!

605
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:15,849
If you touch anything in there,
that's exactly what I'll do!

606
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:19,606
What are you doing?

607
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,728
I'm touching things!

608
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:26,888
Open this door now!

609
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:31,286
I mean it. I'll knock you out.

610
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:40,446
Hey, what's this doohickey
with the trombone slidey thing?

611
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:42,363
Leave that alone. I'm serious!

612
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:45,207
- Will you take me there?
- No!

613
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:47,009
Then you're not serious!

614
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:52,281
Come on.

615
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:55,125
You didn't think that was funny?

616
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,009
You're recording this?

617
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:00,641
If I get you to laugh, I wanna, you know,
have it for posterity.

618
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:02,720
I laughed.

619
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:05,121
You smiled. A smile's not a laugh.

620
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:08,410
Everyone laughs. It's a biological need.

621
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:11,723
Actually, it isn't.
Sleep is a biological need.

622
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:13,802
I've never seen you sleep, either.

623
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,766
Well, sooner or later,
I'm gonna make you laugh.

624
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:21,880
Until you do, I'm not gonna stop trying.

625
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,004
Maybe you should.

626
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:26,321
What?

627
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,764
Stop trying.

628
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:32,766
Why?

629
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,644
Must we record this?

630
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,890
- Get out!
- Wait a second.

631
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,809
What is that? Is that a countdown?

632
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,241
I am not leaving. I deserve to
know what's going on around here.

633
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:44,209
- You deserve...
- Yeah, I deserve some answers.

634
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:46,044
- Answers to what?
- I know that you were there.

635
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:47,246
You don't know anything.

636
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,970
How do you ever
leave a place like that?

637
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:50,371
Because they threw me out!

638
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:59,922
They threw me out
and they locked every door back in.

639
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:06,241
Was it because you built
that something that you shouldn't have?

640
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:07,606
Who told you that?

641
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,361
And is that it?

642
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:12,284
The "something"?

643
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,283
If I could tell you the date,

644
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:21,009
the exact date that you're gonna die,
would you wanna know?

645
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:23,726
- How would you know?
- Let's just say I did.

646
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:25,564
- What are you, a psychic?
- No, that's not the point.

647
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:26,880
Then what is your basis for knowing?

648
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,405
- It's a hypothetical.
- It's a stupid hypothetical.

649
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:31,006
Just use your imagination. All right?

650
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:33,200
- All right.
- Okay.

651
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,370
Let's accept that there is a world

652
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:40,685
where I know, with absolute certainty,
the exact time of your death.

653
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,961
Now, you want me to tell you or not?

654
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:46,643
Yeah, of course I would. Who wouldn't?

655
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:54,282
But what if accepting my death
is what causes it?

656
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:57,963
So the answer is yes.
I would want you to tell me.

657
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,768
- But I wouldn't believe you.
- You have to believe me.

658
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:03,650
Why? Don't we, like,
make our own destiny and stuff?

659
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:12,646
What?

660
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,331
Who are you, kid?

661
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:27,285
Is that bad?

662
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:31,567
Hell.

663
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:33,841
Hell!

664
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,970
- They followed you here?
- What? Who?

665
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:49,681
Robots.

666
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,445
I've never seen them before.

667
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,203
<i>John Francis Walker.</i>

668
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:56,361
<i>You have been permitted to live</i>

669
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:58,408
<i>based upon your
agreed non-intervention.</i>

670
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,801
<i>You are now harboring
a fugitive element.</i>

671
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:03,201
<i>Release her to our custody
or be extinguished.</i>

672
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:05,802
<i>You have one minute to comply.</i>

673
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:23,245
- Thanks.
- Don't thank me yet.

674
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:43,287
Wait.

675
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:51,801
Come on!

676
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:15,767
Let's go!

677
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:24,931
John Francis Walker,
by authority of Governor Nix,

678
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,445
this unit has been authorized

679
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:27,760
<i>to extinguish your life.</i>

680
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:33,326
Okay.

681
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:38,960
Okay.

682
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:43,442
All right, that's enough. That's enough!

683
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,929
Come on. Close the door.

684
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,764
Who the hell is Governor Nix?

685
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:54,770
Let's go. Come on.

686
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:57,051
Get in.

687
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:02,090
How is this a good idea?

688
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:36,771
Move or sink, kid.

689
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,968
You were actually prepared for that?

690
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,449
- My hat.
- Leave it.

691
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,130
No, no, no. I can't go without it.

692
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:00,121
It's my dad's.

693
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:03,484
Now I get it.

694
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:05,802
Too smart for your own good.

695
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:10,367
Father never understood you,
never supported you.

696
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:15,287
And now you wear
his hat as a badge of rebellion, right?

697
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:18,961
No. My dad is amazing.

698
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,688
Wait a second.

699
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,643
We're not talking about me, are we?

700
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:33,325
Why don't we just get you
to your amazing dad

701
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,811
and pretend this never happened?

702
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:36,801
Hop on.

703
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:41,404
- The battery's dead.
- No, it's not.

704
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:43,926
- Then maybe it's the points.
- No, it's not.

705
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,368
- When's the last time you checked...
- You know, you're not helping. You...

706
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:50,685
Get down. Now.

707
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:06,601
Wait.

708
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:10,921
Hello, Frank.

709
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:20,284
Are you going to shoot me?

710
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:25,290
- I'm deciding.
- Could you decide in the truck?

711
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,203
Because we really should get going.

712
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:32,522
- Wait.
- Why? So more robots can show up?

713
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:36,406
She's one of them.

714
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:38,329
Yeah, I know. Are you coming or not?

715
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:46,410
Move over.

716
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:08,284
- Frank...
- Not yet.

717
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:12,451
What are you thinking?
Why would you drag her into this?

718
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:16,161
I didn't drag her into anything.
I gave her a pin.

719
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:17,571
She did the rest.

720
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:19,521
Just like you.

721
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:23,127
Don't even.
Where did you even find the pin?

722
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:24,690
I was there. They destroyed 'em.

723
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:27,843
Not all of them.
I made it out with nearly a dozen.

724
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,365
So you give one to a teenager.

725
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:32,842
Hey, I got a 73 on the
Feinberg/Dusseldorf scale or whatever.

726
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:35,207
You got a 73?
That's not possible.

727
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,521
He's jealous because he scored a 41.

728
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:40,683
You know what? I was 11. I was 11!

729
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:43,122
Hey, don't touch that!

730
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:47,683
This is a one-kiloton detonation.
It is not a toy.

731
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:50,007
Do not mess with my stuff.

732
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:51,206
- You got it?
- Sorry!

733
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:53,851
I didn't begin with her, you know.

734
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:56,730
I wasted years
on other potential candidates.

735
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:58,450
Potential candidates? For what?

736
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,120
That's beautiful.

737
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:04,487
You still think
you're recruiting, don't you?

738
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:06,164
Do not ask her any more questions.

739
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:08,049
She's gonna do her
countermeasure shutdown thing.

740
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:09,520
What countermeasure shutdown thing?

741
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:11,369
Did you tell her you had
a countermeasure shutdown thing?

742
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:15,047
- She was annoying me.
- You lied?

743
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:16,491
Get used to that, kid.

744
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:18,560
One minute,
she's promising you a beautiful future,

745
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:21,365
the next thing you know,
she's leading it to your house to kill you.

746
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:24,410
I'm sorry, but time is running out
and you needed motivation.

747
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:25,527
Motivation for what?

748
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:29,005
- We need to go back over, Frank.
- Back over there?

749
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:31,244
Yes, yes, Frank,
we need to go back over.

750
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:32,845
Good. Great. That's just great.

751
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:36,567
You know, hey, I got stung by a bee.
Let's jump on the hive.

752
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:38,330
That's a terrible analogy.

753
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:41,085
That's a fantastic analogy.
What do you know about analogies?

754
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:43,401
You know, you're impossible to talk
to when you're like this.

755
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:46,922
I am like this because
you derailed my life.

756
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,081
Again.

757
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:50,640
Frank, it's not personal.

758
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:52,641
It's just programming.

759
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,007
We're here!

760
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:04,601
Where are you going?

761
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:07,684
This is where
your wire station's located, isn't it?

762
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,444
We need to get to The Spectacle.

763
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:11,887
- Spectacle?
- Hey. Are you insane?

764
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:14,440
They know that you sent her to me.
They're gonna be waiting for us.

765
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:17,364
Fine. Give me the Edison tube
and we'll go without you.

766
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:20,489
- I don't have the Edison tube.
- It's in your bag.

767
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:23,049
I have x-ray vision.

768
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:26,010
- When did you get x-ray vision?
- She's full of surprises.

769
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:27,445
I know all about her surprises.

770
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:30,763
Chief among them is this.
She doesn't care about you.

771
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:35,246
All that charm and the sense
of purpose, and the cute little smile,

772
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:36,970
it's all just software.

773
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,407
It's ones and zeroes. That's it.

774
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:43,570
Trust me, when you get there,
you're on your own.

775
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:48,008
- What happened to you two?
- He thinks I hurt him.

776
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:51,562
No, you hurt a dumb kid
that was stupid enough to fall...

777
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:58,683
You were many things, Frank Walker.

778
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:03,484
But you were never dumb.

779
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,729
Why don't you just give me
the Edison tube, and...

780
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,882
I'm not giving you anything. I'm...

781
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,445
All right.

782
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:23,330
You want in? I'll bring you in.

783
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:24,845
Why not?

784
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,809
It's better than waiting
around here and getting

785
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,848
hunted and killed, etcetera, etcetera.

786
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:32,487
- That's the spirit.
- "Etcetera"? What's the "etcetera"?

787
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:59,729
- What kind of cables are these?
- The kind that transmit people.

788
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:01,406
People? Like us?

789
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:04,724
- What, like a miniature teleport...
- Do I have to explain everything?

790
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:08,562
Can't you just be amazed and move on?

791
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:11,325
This is all wired to the dish up there.

792
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:16,643
Are you... Are you using satellite?

793
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:20,411
I know how things work.

794
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:23,050
Well, zippity-doo for you.

795
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:28,322
- Wrap this around your eyes, tight.
- Why?

796
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,402
Because justice is blind.

797
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,522
Just do it, kid.

798
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:37,364
You want me to put this over my head?

799
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:40,090
If this takes off my eyebrows...

800
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:42,242
Shut up, open your mouth,
tilt your head back.

801
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:44,851
What is that?

802
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,569
It's powder. Are we at van 't Hoff?

803
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:49,565
Good to go!

804
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:53,531
Good. You set it for the Tower?
There is still a receiver there?

805
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:55,728
- Last I checked.
- How long ago was that?

806
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:00,886
25 years ago.

807
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,400
Roughly.

808
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:10,847
They threw you out, too?

809
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:14,881
Okay, guys. Killer robots.

810
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,001
All right.

811
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:19,765
It's gonna be
bright, cold, and really loud.

812
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:22,411
You're gonna lose
90% of your blood sugar

813
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:23,720
in 1/100th of a second

814
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:26,724
and you're gonna wish you were dead.
But then it'll be over.

815
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:29,765
Don't pee on us.

816
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:32,081
This sounds spectacular.

817
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:36,288
Why now? Why her?

818
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:39,089
Because she hasn't given up.

819
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:40,810
You think she can fix it.

820
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,809
What makes you say that?

821
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:47,926
Can she, Athena?

822
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:50,046
I have no idea.

823
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,569
Let's go find out.

824
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:09,362
Is it... Is this normal?

825
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:31,371
Thirsty.

826
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:33,727
Dying. I think I'm dying.

827
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:35,882
- You're not dying!
- I'm dying.

828
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:37,724
There's Coke in the fridge.

829
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,331
Help yourself.

830
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:00,411
We have no idea how many are here

831
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:01,925
but we're damn sure
they know we're coming.

832
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,048
So, we move quickly. You follow me.

833
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:06,009
No questions. Got it?

834
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:08,321
Got it.

835
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:17,921
Excuse me.

836
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:43,283
- We're in Paris?
- Would you stop being so amazed?

837
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:46,569
- I thought you wanted me to be amazed.
- I want you to stop yammer...

838
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:55,170
- Tower's closing.
- Hell.

839
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:01,921
Come on.

840
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:04,602
Now, you and I are gonna be
on a watch list,

841
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:07,763
but they may not have your facial
recognition profile uploaded yet.

842
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:08,966
- "May not"?
- May not.

843
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:12,442
So, you walk over there,
you take this, you tap him on the neck.

844
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:15,569
- If he's human, it knocks him right out.
- And if it's a robot?

845
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:18,722
- Hey!
- You'll just piss it off.

846
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:20,446
Fantastic.

847
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:25,962
She's got guts. You gotta give her that.

848
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:30,567
Yes, but I was just, you know...

849
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:34,411
Human!

850
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:53,480
The French hated
this thing when Eiffel first unveiled it

851
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:54,851
at the Paris World's Fair.

852
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:56,445
They thought it was an eyesore.

853
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:59,364
Eiffel didn't care, though.
It wasn't meant to be a monument.

854
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:00,840
It was meant to find another world.

855
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:05,685
<i>Les Quatre Premiers.</i>
Plus Ultra's First Four.

856
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:07,205
They were a part of all this?

857
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:12,081
Eiffel, Jules Verne, Tesla,
and Mr. Edison.

858
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:15,326
They designed this antenna
that we're inside.

859
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:17,289
Wait, what?
The Eiffel Tower is an antenna?

860
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:19,203
Now I finally answer your question,
you're gonna interrupt me?

861
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:20,721
Yes.

862
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:24,122
Tesla designed the antenna to observe
every kind of frequency out there.

863
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:26,646
Subspace, trans-dimensional,
you name it.

864
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:29,405
And they found exactly
what they were looking for.

865
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:31,323
And then Edison tried
to take credit for it,

866
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:32,640
because these two hate each other.

867
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:34,051
- Frank...
- Because of alternating...

868
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:35,485
Stay on topic.

869
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:37,325
Yeah. All right, well...

870
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:42,850
There were always rumors
of a secret entrance

871
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:45,486
the Four kept just for themselves.

872
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:51,004
A one-way ticket
in case of emergencies.

873
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:56,681
The Spectacle.

874
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:31,364
You ain't seen nothing yet, kid.

875
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:38,605
It's a rocket.

876
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:44,446
They're coming.

877
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:46,607
All right.

878
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:06,200
Buckle up!

879
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:26,246
- What'd he say?
- Pretty much what you'd expect.

880
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:27,606
Tell him to hang on.

881
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,486
Why are we going back?

882
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:44,121
We're not. We're going through
to another dimension.

883
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:47,164
So we blasted into outer space
just to get a running start?

884
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:49,563
This part may get a little weird.

885
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:48,126
<i>Casey. Wake up.</i>

886
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:52,249
Casey.

887
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:57,126
- Casey. Wake up.
- We're here.

888
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,161
Now what?

889
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:47,726
You tell me.

890
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:51,849
- I tell you? This was your idea.
- I don't have ideas.

891
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:54,169
I just find the people who do.

892
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:55,924
- So there's no plan?
- There's a plan.

893
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:57,690
You just haven't come up with it yet.

894
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:00,842
But you should do that soon.

895
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:06,809
That's just terrific.

896
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:08,721
Here, hide this.

897
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:11,765
Absolutely.

898
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:14,002
Wait. Is that
the one-kiloton detonation thingy

899
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,366
you told me not to play with?

900
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:16,771
Right now, it's our insurance policy.

901
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:19,241
There's a good chance they're gonna
try to kill us right out of the gate.

902
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:21,482
So we're just gonna stand here?

903
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:24,291
Well, you wanted to see Tomorrowland.

904
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:26,645
Here it comes.

905
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:54,200
Take the bag.

906
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:02,681
- Frank.
- David.

907
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:04,561
You look well.

908
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:06,246
Age becomes you.

909
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:08,091
Thanks. You should try it.

910
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:11,685
I don't know. I think I'll just keep
drinking my shake every morning.

911
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:14,447
- Comes in chocolate now.
- Yum.

912
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:19,566
Hello, Athena.

913
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:21,840
I started to think
you were never coming home.

914
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:24,650
Where, oh, where have you been?

915
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:27,641
Your job?

916
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:29,645
I'm sorry. Were we not clear

917
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:31,888
when we suspended
your recruitment protocols?

918
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:34,566
I got that sense when you
called me "bloody obsolete"

919
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:36,125
and tried to disassemble me.

920
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:40,291
Well, you've certainly
caused quite a commotion

921
01:29:40,360 --> 01:29:43,921
by launching an antique rocket ship
out of the Eiffel Tower.

922
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:47,164
Under normal circumstances,

923
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:50,642
we'd be working overtime to convince
everyone it was just an elaborate hoax.

924
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:54,930
Fortunately, for all of us,
doesn't really matter now, does it?

925
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:56,646
Why doesn't it matter?

926
01:29:58,600 --> 01:29:59,931
And who might you be?

927
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:04,120
I'm Casey. Newton.

928
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:07,689
And who might you be?

929
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:10,005
David Nix.

930
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,047
Pleasure.

931
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:15,047
Well, Frank, it's been
wonderful catching up,

932
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:18,363
but as we were fairly clear
about the terms of your exile

933
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:20,488
and the consequences of violating it,

934
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:23,649
I have to ask
what the hell are you doing here?

935
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:25,245
I think she can fix it.

936
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:31,088
- I'm sorry.
- Her.

937
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:34,125
- I think she can fix it, David.
- Wait. What?

938
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:35,480
I've been pirating your signal.

939
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:38,410
Every time you turn it on here,
I can see it there.

940
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:40,164
And it flickered.

941
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:42,242
The percentage dropped, David.

942
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:44,241
Impossible.

943
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:46,640
You don't believe me?
Let's go find out right now.

944
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:50,606
- I'm sorry, what can I fix?
- The world, Miss Newton.

945
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:54,520
He thinks you can fix the world.

946
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,571
Is that like a portal to Earth?

947
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:23,925
No. it is a bridgeway to Earth.

948
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:32,400
Welcome back to The Monitor, Frank.

949
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,364
It's something, isn't it?

950
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:37,600
Yeah, it's something.

951
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:56,283
Don't worry about the light show.

952
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:58,125
It's perfectly safe.

953
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:03,441
Am I supposed to do something?

954
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:05,804
Okay, could you be a bit more specific?

955
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:07,560
Because fixing
the world sounds a little...

956
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:09,250
Just be yourself.

957
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:11,611
Gotcha.

958
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:16,084
Flashes of the future.

959
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:19,643
- What are those?
- Flashes of future.

960
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:22,209
This is us a few seconds from now.

961
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:26,771
This whole tower
funnels energy via tachyon,

962
01:32:26,840 --> 01:32:29,207
a particle that
moves significantly faster than light.

963
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:31,931
We discovered them
almost 40 years ago.

964
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,083
Your physicists
are still arguing over whether they exist.

965
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:36,241
Oh, dear.

966
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:38,327
Too late.

967
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:39,925
Oh, dear.

968
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:41,481
Too late.

969
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,684
So, on with the show.

970
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:03,128
We've enhanced
the interface significantly

971
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:06,010
but it still functions
on your original algorithm.

972
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:09,682
You have something
to show me, Frank?

973
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:11,561
Show me.

974
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:24,726
Pick a place.

975
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:28,168
- What?
- A location anywhere in the world.

976
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:29,366
Pick one.

977
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:32,281
Canaveral.

978
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:34,851
Cape Canaveral.

979
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:50,046
Easy, easy.

980
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:54,964
The interface is oriented from
your hands to the center of the Earth.

981
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:57,482
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it.

982
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:04,245
You trained her obviously.

983
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:06,570
I just met her yesterday.

984
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:08,970
She knows how things work.

985
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:16,928
<i>You told me this story my entire life,
and now I'm telling you.</i>

986
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,490
How is this possible?

987
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:21,325
We are millions
of exponential deviances

988
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:23,846
Away from the dimension you call home.

989
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:26,321
Frank had the novel idea
of building this machine

990
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:28,721
so that we could keep in touch.

991
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:31,645
This is three days ago.

992
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:33,525
Relatively.

993
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:37,241
That's space/time humor.

994
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:43,203
Because tachyons
travel faster than light,

995
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:44,685
once we harness them...

996
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:46,649
You can see backwards in time.

997
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:48,966
Not just backwards.

998
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:52,401
You're kidding.

999
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:54,601
No.

1000
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:20,925
What happened?

1001
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:22,400
Keep going.

1002
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:24,924
Just a little further.

1003
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:12,647
That's enough.

1004
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:16,251
That's enough, kid.

1005
01:36:22,040 --> 01:36:23,326
That's my house.

1006
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:27,888
It would have been nice if Frank
had prepared you for this,

1007
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:30,926
but I'm afraid the world is ending.

1008
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:36,161
It is certain, it is unavoidable,
and it is coming.

1009
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:37,881
When?

1010
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:41,204
This is 58 days from now.

1011
01:36:42,040 --> 01:36:43,929
58 days?

1012
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:48,047
But whatever caused this could happen
any time after the static starts.

1013
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:49,804
It could be a month.

1014
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:51,370
It could be sooner.

1015
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:02,568
Still looking for your flicker, Frank?

1016
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:04,561
I know what I saw.

1017
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:09,006
So why aren't you telling anyone?

1018
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:13,563
The whole planet is gonna die
and you're just sitting here?

1019
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:15,611
We're not gonna die.

1020
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:18,004
This is your world, not ours.

1021
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:20,084
We'll be perfectly fine here.

1022
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:22,527
Then why don't you let people in?

1023
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:26,604
- Tell her, David.
- Frank.

1024
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:31,242
All those years in exile,
and you still don't understand.

1025
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:33,926
These people are driven by savagery.

1026
01:37:34,440 --> 01:37:36,886
If we told them about this place,

1027
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:41,368
then that would happen here to us.

1028
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:42,771
Then nothing would survive.

1029
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:45,281
But it hasn't happened yet!

1030
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:47,886
Actually, it has happened.
You just haven't accepted it.

1031
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:49,291
Well, I don't accept it!

1032
01:37:56,680 --> 01:37:58,967
Did you see that? Did you see that?

1033
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,690
David, I know that you saw that.

1034
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:03,331
That means that there is a chance.
There's at least a chance...

1035
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:13,049
That went quite well, don't you think?

1036
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:15,851
- What happened?
- You're being deported.

1037
01:38:17,240 --> 01:38:18,571
Again.

1038
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:21,406
Well, that's Nix for you.

1039
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:23,721
No new ideas.

1040
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:27,202
Apparently, your
1/10,000 variable in the Inevitability

1041
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:29,851
wasn't convincing enough
to change his mind.

1042
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:36,965
Be gentle.

1043
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:49,245
You okay?

1044
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:53,008
You know, you'd think
somewhere in the zillions

1045
01:38:53,080 --> 01:38:56,607
of questions that I was asking you,
you could have said,

1046
01:38:56,680 --> 01:38:58,762
"Casey, that stuff's not really the issue

1047
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:02,322
"because our future-predicting
machine says we're all gonna die."

1048
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:04,804
We did sort of hint at it.

1049
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:07,201
This place has nothing to do with hope.

1050
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:09,650
It's the opposite of hope.

1051
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:11,882
- Come on. Don't say that.
- Why not?

1052
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:14,006
You said it.

1053
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:16,245
No wonder you gave up.

1054
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:18,529
That's before I knew about you.

1055
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:22,123
I mean, you really...
You really are special.

1056
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:24,282
Why do you people
keep saying that to me?

1057
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:28,365
I'm not!

1058
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:34,724
Why'd you even give me this?

1059
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:38,530
You showed me a place
that was amazing and incredible

1060
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:40,409
and it was a lie.

1061
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:43,843
If you're gonna zap an idea
into people's heads,

1062
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:45,490
you should really make sure
that it's the truth.

1063
01:39:45,560 --> 01:39:48,404
Because you can't do that.
You can't just zap...

1064
01:39:58,400 --> 01:39:59,481
What?

1065
01:40:00,440 --> 01:40:02,204
Zap an idea into people's heads.

1066
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:07,763
You were pirating the signal.

1067
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:09,330
- How?
- What?

1068
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:11,681
At your house.
All your TVs, your doomsday room.

1069
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:13,808
You were boosting
the feed from that Monitor thing.

1070
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:15,370
- How did you do that?
- No big deal.

1071
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:19,206
They're running so much power through
it now, a ham radio could pick it up.

1072
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:21,487
It's just a matter of finding
the right frequency...

1073
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:25,123
You grabbed a signal
from another dimension.

1074
01:40:25,640 --> 01:40:29,406
From a machine here.
That means it's transmitting there.

1075
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:32,165
What if it's not just
predicting the future?

1076
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:34,211
It's broadcasting it.

1077
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:36,210
When I touched this thing

1078
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:38,806
for a few minutes,
it felt like anything was possible.

1079
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:41,400
So then why can't the opposite happen?

1080
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:44,051
What if The Monitor is just a giant pin?

1081
01:40:44,120 --> 01:40:45,884
But instead of making
you think positive,

1082
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:48,281
it makes you think negative and it...

1083
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:54,281
And it's convincing
the whole world to feed the wrong wolf.

1084
01:40:55,480 --> 01:40:57,130
We need to turn that thing off.

1085
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:04,166
It's time to go home.

1086
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:12,529
David. David.

1087
01:41:13,960 --> 01:41:16,247
- It's uninhabited and uncharted.
- Listen to me.

1088
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:19,085
But it looks like a lovely place
to spend your last days.

1089
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:21,401
David... The Monitor is
acting as an antenna.

1090
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:23,403
It isn't just receiving tachyons.

1091
01:41:23,480 --> 01:41:25,528
It is taking a possible future and...

1092
01:41:25,640 --> 01:41:28,610
And amplifying it,
transmitting it, like a feedback loop.

1093
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:31,763
It's a self-fulfilling prophecy
that's coming from right there.

1094
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:33,808
But it's not just
showing people the end of the world,

1095
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:36,531
it's giving them the idea over and over
again until they just accept it!

1096
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:39,080
It's a ticking time bomb,
and we're the ones that lit the fuse.

1097
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:42,004
We still have 58 days
to try and change things.

1098
01:41:42,080 --> 01:41:44,606
But nothing will work
as long as that thing is still on.

1099
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:45,920
Young lady, I'm gonna assume

1100
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,651
that your knowledge
of tachyonic fusion is a little sketchy.

1101
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:53,521
Shutting it down is impossible.
There is no off.

1102
01:41:54,520 --> 01:41:56,761
I'm telling you what it's doing.

1103
01:41:56,880 --> 01:41:58,609
Why don't you care?

1104
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:01,010
Because he's the one that's doing it.

1105
01:42:07,640 --> 01:42:08,880
Right?

1106
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:14,000
Let's imagine.

1107
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:19,964
If you glimpsed the future
and were frightened by what you saw,

1108
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:23,249
what would you do
with that information? You would go to...

1109
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:26,531
Who? Politicians?
Captains of industry?

1110
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:29,883
And how would you convince them?
With data? Facts?

1111
01:42:30,760 --> 01:42:31,886
Good luck.

1112
01:42:32,040 --> 01:42:33,769
The only facts they won't challenge

1113
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:37,481
are the ones that keep the wheels
greased and the dollars rolling in.

1114
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:39,210
But what if...

1115
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:42,250
What if there was a way
of skipping the middleman

1116
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:45,722
and putting the critical news
directly into everyone's head?

1117
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:51,000
The probability of
widespread annihilation kept going up.

1118
01:42:51,080 --> 01:42:54,243
The only way to stop it was to show it.

1119
01:42:54,680 --> 01:42:56,170
To scare people straight.

1120
01:42:56,240 --> 01:42:59,767
Because what reasonable
human being wouldn't be galvanized

1121
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:01,001
by the potential destruction of

1122
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:02,844
everything they have
ever known or loved?

1123
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:09,448
To save civilization,
I would show its collapse.

1124
01:43:11,080 --> 01:43:13,526
But how do you think
this vision was received?

1125
01:43:14,120 --> 01:43:17,966
How do you think people responded
to the prospect of imminent doom?

1126
01:43:18,080 --> 01:43:21,243
They gobbled it up,
like a chocolate éclair.

1127
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:24,811
They didn't fear their demise,
they repackaged it.

1128
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:29,890
It can be enjoyed as video games,
as TV shows, books, movies.

1129
01:43:29,960 --> 01:43:33,567
The entire world wholeheartedly
embraced the apocalypse

1130
01:43:33,640 --> 01:43:36,007
and sprinted towards it
with gleeful abandon.

1131
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:40,207
Meanwhile, your Earth
was crumbling all around you.

1132
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:43,966
You've got simultaneous
epidemics of obesity and starvation.

1133
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:45,087
Explain that one.

1134
01:43:46,360 --> 01:43:49,330
Bees and butterflies start to disappear.

1135
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:50,970
The glaciers melt.

1136
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:54,089
Algae blooms all around you.

1137
01:43:54,160 --> 01:43:56,128
The coal mine canaries
are dropping dead,

1138
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:58,931
and you won't take the hint!

1139
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:03,606
In every moment,
there is the possibility of a better future.

1140
01:44:03,680 --> 01:44:05,444
But you people won't believe it.

1141
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:06,646
And because you won't believe it,

1142
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:09,764
you won't do what is necessary
to make it a reality.

1143
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:13,890
So you dwell on this terrible future,
and you resign yourselves to it.

1144
01:44:13,960 --> 01:44:14,960
For one reason,

1145
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:19,244
because that future doesn't
ask anything of you today.

1146
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:25,924
So, yes, we saw the iceberg,
we warned the <i>Titanic.</i>

1147
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:30,808
But you all just steered for it anyway,
full steam ahead.

1148
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:31,961
Why?

1149
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:35,362
Because you want to sink.

1150
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:38,530
You gave up.

1151
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:43,729
That's not The Monitor's fault.
That's yours.

1152
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:49,046
Put them through.

1153
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:55,044
Thanks for visiting, Frank.

1154
01:44:56,280 --> 01:44:58,681
It was genuinely nice to see you again.

1155
01:45:08,720 --> 01:45:10,529
- What are you doing?
- Not giving up.

1156
01:45:27,720 --> 01:45:28,801
Look out!

1157
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:36,368
- Get the thing!
- What thing?

1158
01:45:36,440 --> 01:45:39,205
The thing I gave you
when we first got here!

1159
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:43,282
Arm it! Get on the platform!

1160
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:52,641
Casey! The bomb!

1161
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:54,803
Get on the platform!

1162
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:15,490
- Now what?
- Arm it!

1163
01:46:15,560 --> 01:46:16,800
How?

1164
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:45,040
Casey!

1165
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:52,046
The bomb! Where is the bomb?

1166
01:48:13,240 --> 01:48:15,561
<i>One minute to detonation.</i>

1167
01:48:19,720 --> 01:48:21,006
<i>45 seconds.</i>

1168
01:48:21,080 --> 01:48:24,129
Athena! The bomb.
What do I do? How do I turn it off?

1169
01:48:24,200 --> 01:48:25,486
<i>30 seconds.</i>

1170
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:26,931
You can't.

1171
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:32,568
This is not funny!

1172
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:38,526
Frank, get out of there! It's gonna blow!

1173
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:40,921
Frank, get out!

1174
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:45,001
Get out of there!

1175
01:48:45,120 --> 01:48:47,805
<i>- Four. Three.</i>
- Close the portal!

1176
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:49,564
<i>- Two. One.</i>
- Close the portal!

1177
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:21,841
- Are you all right?
- The bomb's gone.

1178
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:23,046
- Can you stand?
- Yeah.

1179
01:49:23,160 --> 01:49:24,321
Frank!

1180
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:29,561
No.

1181
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:33,209
The bomb's gone.

1182
01:49:33,280 --> 01:49:35,009
- Can you stand?
- Yeah.

1183
01:49:35,120 --> 01:49:36,167
Frank!

1184
01:49:50,680 --> 01:49:53,126
- What happened? Is she okay?
- I need to get her to a repair module.

1185
01:49:53,200 --> 01:49:56,283
Frank! No one's going to repair me.

1186
01:49:57,160 --> 01:49:58,491
Not in time.

1187
01:49:59,160 --> 01:50:01,322
I need to tell you something now.

1188
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:09,926
Darn.

1189
01:50:11,080 --> 01:50:12,650
I'm shutting down.

1190
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:15,200
<i>I'm shutting down.</i>

1191
01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:18,970
I'm going to lose sync.

1192
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:22,084
Don't look at me like that.

1193
01:50:22,240 --> 01:50:27,485
- If I lose sync, it's not failure.
- I know.

1194
01:50:29,480 --> 01:50:32,245
There are things
I need to tell you before the final...

1195
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:36,166
Before the automated program kicks in.

1196
01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:38,644
I'm a machine.

1197
01:50:39,200 --> 01:50:41,521
I never thought that was bad

1198
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:43,807
until I saw your face
when you found out I was.

1199
01:50:43,880 --> 01:50:45,120
I always knew.

1200
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:47,840
No, you didn't.

1201
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:49,731

a manner that is difficult to recognize.</i>

1205
01:51:05,080 --> 01:51:08,243
<i>It seems imperative to explain to him
that I am an Audio-Animatronic...</i>

<i>But I am concerned
that he may be adversely affected</i>

1208

<i>when he finds out that I am not human.</i>

1209
01:51:17,040 --> 01:51:18,610
<i>He has potential.</i>

1210

<i>I don't want to damage it.</i>

1211
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:23,531
<i>He needs someone to believe in him.</i>

1212
01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:25,762
<i>And I am fulfilling that need.</i>

1213

<i>I'm having unusual thoughts

1216
01:51:39,120 --> 01:51:42,249
<i>I suspect a flaw
in my empathy interface.</i>

1217
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:44,641

<i>He says he has lost hope</i>

1223
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:05,126
<i>and he holds me responsible for
having given it to him in the first place.</i>

1224
01:52:05,640 --> 01:52:07,369
<i>I do not understand this.</i>

1225

<i>He says I never will</i>

1226

I was designed to find dreamers.

1230
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:29,891
I found you.

1231
01:52:33,440 --> 01:52:34,930
And lost you.

1232
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:38,171
Till I found her.

1233
01:52:39,720 --> 01:52:40,926
Casey.

1234
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:47,009
Dreamers need to stick together.

1235
01:52:50,240 --> 01:52:51,730
It's not programming.

1236
01:52:52,840 --> 01:52:54,205
It's personal.

1237
01:53:01,840 --> 01:53:03,126
The Monitor.

1238
01:53:03,200 --> 01:53:06,886
The bomb is gone. But I'm not, yet.

1241
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:14,646
You know what to do, Frank.

1242
01:53:15,240 --> 01:53:17,891
Help get it right this time.

1243
01:53:21,200 --> 01:53:22,964
I thought you can't have ideas.

1244
01:53:23,720 --> 01:53:26,326
Well, what do you know?

1245
01:53:29,320 --> 01:53:30,765
What do you know?

1246
01:53:33,880 --> 01:53:35,564
Systems failing.

1247
01:54:17,560 --> 01:54:19,449
- Frank?
- Yeah?

1248
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:23,770
Do you want to know
why you could never make me laugh?

1249
01:54:26,120 --> 01:54:27,281
Why?

1250
01:54:28,840 --> 01:54:30,569
Because you're not funny.

1251
01:54:43,080 --> 01:54:44,923
You can let me go now.

1252
01:54:52,120 --> 01:54:53,485
Goodbye, Frank.

1253
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:03,811
Goodbye, Athena.

1255
01:56:26,720 --> 01:56:27,721
Now what?

1256
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:31,490
You're asking me?

1257
01:56:32,080 --> 01:56:33,889
This was your idea, kid.

1258
01:56:36,080 --> 01:56:37,161
Yeah.

1259
01:56:40,160 --> 01:56:41,730
You think it will work?

1260
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:46,241
I guess we have to make it work.

1261
01:57:01,760 --> 01:57:03,603
<i>So, we're making it work.</i>

01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:06,404
<i>First order of business,</i>

1263
01:57:07,400 --> 01:57:08,845
<i>get the door back open.</i>

1264
01:57:13,960 --> 01:57:17,681
<i>Couldn't hurt to get a few
experienced engineers over here.</i>

1265
01:57:21,960 --> 01:57:23,086
<i>Next...</i>

1266
01:57:23,400 --> 01:57:25,801
<i>Put the party back on.</i>

1267
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,606
<i>And print out some new invitations.</i>

1268
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:35,565
<i>Which brings us to
why we're here today.</i>

1269
01:57:36,280 --> 01:57:39,204
A year ago, it was
all supposed to be over.

1270
01:57:39,320 --> 01:57:40,731
We shouldn't even be here.

1271
01:57:41,480 --> 01:57:42,811
But we are.

1272
01:57:44,200 --> 01:57:47,727
It isn't hard to knock down
a big, evil building

1273
01:57:47,800 --> 01:57:50,485
that's telling everybody
that the world's gonna end.

1274
01:57:51,640 --> 01:57:53,210
What is hard

1275
01:57:54,480 --> 01:57:57,131
is figuring out what to build in its place.

1276
01:57:58,160 --> 01:58:01,801
And if we're gonna do that,
we can't do it alone.

1277
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:04,684
We're gonna need all of you.

1278
01:58:06,680 --> 01:58:10,207
- Frank Walker, may I ask a question?
- Sure.

1279
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:14,166
The search parameters you've given us,
while mathematically sound,

1280
01:58:14,240 --> 01:58:17,528
are a bit undefined.

1281
01:58:18,560 --> 01:58:20,449
Could you be more specific, please?

1282
01:58:21,160 --> 01:58:22,685
Well, Miss Newton,

1283
01:58:23,640 --> 01:58:26,723
you wanna tell our new recruiters
what they're looking for?

1284
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:28,211
Dreamers.

1285
01:58:28,680 --> 01:58:32,002
We are looking for dreamers.

1286
01:58:34,040 --> 01:58:35,963
Anyone who will feed the right wolf.

1287
01:58:46,760 --> 01:58:50,401
So, I once told your predecessor

1288
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:54,886
that she was nothing
but a combination of ones and zeroes.

1289
01:58:58,680 --> 01:58:59,727
I was wrong.

1290
01:59:00,440 --> 01:59:02,044
She was much more than that.

1291
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:05,041
You are much more than that, too.

1292
01:59:05,600 --> 01:59:08,729
So, go out there
and do what she would have done.

1293
01:59:09,920 --> 01:59:12,048
Find the ones who haven't given up.

1294
01:59:13,080 --> 01:59:14,286
They're the future.

1294
01:59:15,305 --> 02:00:15,317
