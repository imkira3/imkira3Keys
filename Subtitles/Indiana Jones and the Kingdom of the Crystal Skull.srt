2
00:00:55,153 --> 00:00:57,237
Come on, let's go! Let's go!

3
00:00:59,657 --> 00:01:01,075
Hey! Hey, guys!

4
00:01:19,427 --> 00:01:20,803
Faster!

5
00:01:22,138 --> 00:01:23,764
Hey, what you got under there?

6
00:01:23,848 --> 00:01:25,599
- Hey, you want to race?
- Oh, please.

7
00:01:25,683 --> 00:01:27,726
- Come on!
- Come on, let's go!

8
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:36,902
Come on!

9
00:01:39,697 --> 00:01:42,908
- Please?
- Come on! Let's go! Come on!

10
00:01:59,467 --> 00:02:01,009
Come on. Let's go.

11
00:02:03,555 --> 00:02:05,556
Go faster! Faster!

12
00:02:53,938 --> 00:02:55,063
Sorry, gentlemen.

13
00:02:55,148 --> 00:02:58,025
This whole area is closed for
weapons testing for the next 24 hours.

14
00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:01,069
That includes all on-base personnel.

15
00:03:01,154 --> 00:03:02,946
Good afternoon, sir.

16
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:11,747
I'm afraid that goes for you,
too, Colonel, sir.

17
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:13,165
The Pentagon sent out revised ...

18
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,667
Russians.

19
00:04:40,461 --> 00:04:42,796
This ain't gonna be easy.

20
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,631
Not as easy as it used to be.

21
00:04:44,716 --> 00:04:47,509
- Well, we've been through worse.
- Yeah? When?

22
00:04:47,593 --> 00:04:49,511
Flensburg. There was twice as many.

23
00:04:49,595 --> 00:04:51,930
- We were younger.
- I still am young!

24
00:04:52,015 --> 00:04:53,265
We had guns.

25
00:04:53,349 --> 00:04:57,144
Put your hands down, will you?
You're embarrassing us.

26
00:04:57,228 --> 00:04:59,855
Bet you 500 bucks
we can get out of this.

27
00:05:09,907 --> 00:05:11,575
Let's call it 100.

28
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:17,497
You recognize building, yes?

29
00:05:24,339 --> 00:05:25,714
Drop dead.

30
00:05:31,179 --> 00:05:33,138
I'm sorry.

31
00:05:33,222 --> 00:05:35,557
I meant drop dead, comrade.

32
00:05:53,117 --> 00:05:56,036
- Where was he found?
- In Mexico.

33
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,664
They were digging in the dirt,
looking for this stuff.

34
00:06:04,712 --> 00:06:07,130
You're not from around here, are you?

35
00:06:07,215 --> 00:06:11,802
Where is it you would imagine
I am from, Dr. Jones?

36
00:06:12,804 --> 00:06:14,971
Well, the way you're sinking your
teeth into those wubble-u's,

37
00:06:15,056 --> 00:06:18,475
I should think maybe Eastern Ukraine.

38
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:20,519
Highest marks.

39
00:06:20,603 --> 00:06:22,646
Colonel Dr. Irina Spalko.

40
00:06:24,565 --> 00:06:27,943
Three times
I have received Order of Lenin.

41
00:06:28,027 --> 00:06:32,072
Also medal as Hero of Socialist Labor.

42
00:06:32,156 --> 00:06:33,490
And why?

43
00:06:34,742 --> 00:06:39,746
Because I know things.
I know them before anyone else.

44
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:43,041
And what I do not know, I find out.

45
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:48,839
Now, what I need to know now
is in here.

46
00:07:04,105 --> 00:07:08,650
- You are a hard man to read, Dr. Jones.
- Ouch.

47
00:07:08,734 --> 00:07:13,530
So, we will do this, what is
expression, old-fashioned way.

48
00:07:13,614 --> 00:07:17,117
You will tell us.
You will help us find what we seek.

49
00:07:39,307 --> 00:07:41,766
This warehouse is where you
and your government ...

50
00:07:41,851 --> 00:07:44,561
have hidden all of your secrets, yes?

51
00:07:44,645 --> 00:07:48,940
This is a military warehouse.
I've never been here before in my life.

52
00:07:50,568 --> 00:07:52,777
Object we seek,
rectangular storage container,

53
00:07:52,862 --> 00:07:56,573
dimensions 2 meters by 0.5 meter
by 66 centimeters.

54
00:07:56,657 --> 00:07:59,743
Contents of box, mummified remains.

55
00:07:59,827 --> 00:08:02,245
This is no doubt familiar to you.

56
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:05,749
What makes you think I've got any
idea what box you're talking about?

57
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,918
Because 10 years ago ...

58
00:08:08,002 --> 00:08:11,046
you were part of the team
that examined it.

59
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,550
Look ...

60
00:08:15,635 --> 00:08:19,179
Even if I knew
what you were talking about ...

61
00:08:19,263 --> 00:08:22,766
You will help us find it.

62
00:08:34,028 --> 00:08:36,571
Compass. I need a compass.

63
00:08:36,656 --> 00:08:38,365
You know, north, south, east ...

64
00:08:38,449 --> 00:08:39,783
West.

65
00:08:41,369 --> 00:08:43,036
No compass?

66
00:08:44,956 --> 00:08:46,831
I need your bullets.

67
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,801
The contents of that box
are highly magnetized.

68
00:08:57,885 --> 00:08:59,010
I need gunpowder.

69
00:08:59,095 --> 00:09:02,013
You want my help or not?

70
00:09:14,902 --> 00:09:19,072
Don't toy with me, Dr. Jones.
What is the point of all this?

71
00:09:19,156 --> 00:09:21,074
If it's still magnetic,

72
00:09:21,158 --> 00:09:24,369
the metal in this gunpowder
should point the way.

73
00:09:54,734 --> 00:09:57,652
Shells. Give me some shotgun shells.

74
00:10:00,948 --> 00:10:02,157
Pliers.

75
00:13:20,231 --> 00:13:24,067
Drop the guns,
or Colonel Dr. Spalko is dead.

76
00:13:45,005 --> 00:13:46,714
Why, Mac?

77
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:49,175
Well, what can I say, Jonesey?

78
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,595
I'm a capitalist, and they pay.

79
00:13:54,431 --> 00:13:57,684
After all those years
we spent spying on the Reds?

80
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,146
I thought we were friends, Mac.

81
00:14:02,231 --> 00:14:05,358
I've had a run of bad luck
with the cards lately, mate.

82
00:14:05,442 --> 00:14:07,986
Awful. Bloody awful.

83
00:14:09,613 --> 00:14:12,282
I can't go home empty-handed again.

84
00:14:12,992 --> 00:14:16,160
No defiant last words, Dr. Jones?

85
00:14:18,622 --> 00:14:20,832
I like Ike.

86
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,417
Put down gun.

87
00:14:23,252 --> 00:14:24,919
You got it, pal.

88
00:14:51,822 --> 00:14:54,240
Damn, I thought that was closer.

89
00:14:58,454 --> 00:14:59,621
Come on. Come on.

90
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,183
He's not to get out of here alive!
Block the exits!

91
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,358
Don't get clever, Boris.
You don't know him.

92
00:15:28,442 --> 00:15:29,484
Know him. Know him.

93
00:15:29,568 --> 00:15:31,694
You don't know him!
You don't know him!

94
00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:34,864
You don't know him!
You don't know ...

95
00:17:14,923 --> 00:17:16,424
You did well.

96
00:18:56,358 --> 00:18:58,943
Hello? Hello?

97
00:19:04,783 --> 00:19:06,033
Hello!

98
00:19:07,411 --> 00:19:09,537
Hey. I knocked.
You guys got a ...

99
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,337
Wait a minute.

100
00:19:18,422 --> 00:19:20,173
Come on, gang!

101
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,271
Oh, that can't be good.

102
00:19:37,649 --> 00:19:41,027
All personnel,
it is now one minute to zero time.

103
00:19:41,278 --> 00:19:43,863
Put on goggles or turn away.

104
00:19:43,947 --> 00:19:49,202
Do not remove goggles or face burst
until 10 seconds after first light.

105
00:19:49,286 --> 00:19:50,786
That can't be good at all.

106
00:19:58,503 --> 00:20:02,298
Wait! Wait!
Wait, wait, wait! Wait!

107
00:20:05,219 --> 00:20:07,553
Sure! Great! Don't wait for me!

108
00:20:07,638 --> 00:20:09,263
Minus 15 seconds.

109
00:20:17,231 --> 00:20:19,732
Minus 10 seconds.

110
00:20:19,983 --> 00:20:26,072
Niner, eight, seven, six,

111
00:20:26,156 --> 00:20:30,076
fiver, four,

112
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:34,330
three, two, one, zero.

113
00:22:05,255 --> 00:22:08,341
I had no reason to believe
that Mac was a spy.

114
00:22:08,425 --> 00:22:10,760
He was Ml6 when I was in OSS.

115
00:22:10,844 --> 00:22:13,721
We did 20, 30 missions together
in Europe and the Pacific.

116
00:22:13,805 --> 00:22:16,223
Don't wave your war record
in our face, Colonel Jones.

117
00:22:16,308 --> 00:22:18,225
We all served.

118
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,686
No kidding?
What side were you on?

119
00:22:20,771 --> 00:22:23,522
I don't think you recognize
the gravity of your situation.

120
00:22:23,607 --> 00:22:26,108
You aided and abetted KGB agents ...

121
00:22:26,193 --> 00:22:29,362
who broke into a top-secret
military installation ...

122
00:22:29,446 --> 00:22:32,239
in the middle of the
United States of America, my country.

123
00:22:32,324 --> 00:22:35,284
What was in the steel box they took?

124
00:22:35,369 --> 00:22:38,120
You tell us. You've seen it before.

125
00:22:42,542 --> 00:22:45,252
You mean that Air Force fiasco in '47.

126
00:22:47,381 --> 00:22:49,590
I was tossed into a bus
with blacked-out windows ...

127
00:22:49,674 --> 00:22:52,593
and 20 people
I wasn't allowed to speak to.

128
00:22:52,677 --> 00:22:54,762
Hauled out in the middle of the
night in the middle of nowhere ...

129
00:22:54,846 --> 00:22:57,390
on some urgent recovery project
and shown what?

130
00:22:57,474 --> 00:22:58,557
Pieces of wreckage ...

131
00:22:58,642 --> 00:23:03,312
and an intensely magnetic shroud
covering mutilated remains?

132
00:23:03,397 --> 00:23:06,315
None of us
was ever given the full picture.

133
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,068
And we were threatened with treason
if we ever talked about it.

134
00:23:09,152 --> 00:23:10,986
So, you tell me,
what was in the box?

135
00:23:11,071 --> 00:23:12,405
Indy, thank God.

136
00:23:12,489 --> 00:23:14,740
Don't you know it's dangerous
to climb into a refrigerator?

137
00:23:14,825 --> 00:23:16,575
Those things can be deathtraps!

138
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,078
Good to see you, too, Bob.

139
00:23:19,162 --> 00:23:21,580
Relax, boys.
I can vouch for Dr. Jones.

140
00:23:21,665 --> 00:23:23,541
What the hell is going on?

141
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:26,335
KGB on American soil?
Who is that woman?

142
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,212
Describe her.

143
00:23:28,296 --> 00:23:29,922
Tall, thin, mid-30s,

144
00:23:30,006 --> 00:23:32,716
carried a sword of some kind,
a rapier, I think.

145
00:23:36,346 --> 00:23:38,180
Yeah, that's her.

146
00:23:38,265 --> 00:23:39,849
You sure she's here?

147
00:23:39,933 --> 00:23:42,309
Here and gone. Who is she?

148
00:23:42,394 --> 00:23:45,980
Irina Spalko,
she was Stalin's fair-haired girl.

149
00:23:46,064 --> 00:23:49,942
His favorite scientist, if you
can call psychic research science.

150
00:23:50,026 --> 00:23:51,110
General Ross ...

151
00:23:51,194 --> 00:23:53,446
She's leading teams from the
Kremlin all over the world.

152
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:54,655
Scooping up artifacts ...

153
00:23:54,739 --> 00:23:57,450
she thinks might have
paranormal military applications.

154
00:23:57,534 --> 00:24:00,494
- General Ross!
- Back off, Paul.

155
00:24:00,579 --> 00:24:04,123
Not everyone in the Army's a Commie
and certainly not Indy.

156
00:24:04,207 --> 00:24:08,627
What exactly am I being accused of,
besides surviving a nuclear blast?

157
00:24:08,712 --> 00:24:09,795
Nothing yet.

158
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,797
But frankly your association
with George McHale ...

159
00:24:11,882 --> 00:24:16,135
makes all your activities suspicious,
including those during the war.

160
00:24:16,219 --> 00:24:18,137
Are you nuts?

161
00:24:18,221 --> 00:24:21,474
Do you have any idea how many medals
this son of a bitch won?

162
00:24:21,558 --> 00:24:23,559
A great many, I'm sure.

163
00:24:24,728 --> 00:24:27,313
But does he deserve them?

164
00:24:27,397 --> 00:24:31,400
Dr. Jones, let's just say for now
that you are of interest to the Bureau.

165
00:24:31,485 --> 00:24:33,652
Of great interest.

166
00:24:42,537 --> 00:24:45,289
Grooved Ware in the beginning
of modern drainage practices,

167
00:24:45,373 --> 00:24:48,834
which we also see in Skara Brae
on the west coast of Scotland.

168
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:51,545
Skara Brae dates from 3100 B.C.

169
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:54,340
and was continuously occupied
for 600 years ...

170
00:24:54,424 --> 00:24:57,301
until it was apparently
abandoned in 2500 B.C.

171
00:24:57,385 --> 00:24:59,512
There's no clear evidence
as to why its occupants ...

172
00:24:59,596 --> 00:25:04,433
decided to abandon a perfectly
healthy environment. Yes?

173
00:25:04,518 --> 00:25:07,937
- May I have a moment, Professor?
- Yes.

174
00:25:08,605 --> 00:25:10,481
Open up Michaelson.
Review Chapter 4.

175
00:25:10,565 --> 00:25:11,690
When I come back we'll discuss ...

176
00:25:11,775 --> 00:25:14,735
the difference between
migration and exodus.

177
00:25:20,867 --> 00:25:22,117
What?

178
00:25:22,827 --> 00:25:25,621
You have no idea the pressure
coming from the Board of Regents.

179
00:25:25,705 --> 00:25:27,039
The FBI showed up this morning,

180
00:25:27,123 --> 00:25:29,708
ransacked your office,
searched all your files!

181
00:25:29,793 --> 00:25:31,627
You're the dean of the college.
Why didn't you stop them?

182
00:25:31,711 --> 00:25:32,962
They have no right.

183
00:25:33,046 --> 00:25:35,464
They had every right!
They weren't vandals.

184
00:25:35,549 --> 00:25:37,967
They were federal agents
with search warrants!

185
00:25:38,051 --> 00:25:41,512
The university isn't gonna get itself
embroiled in that kind of controversy,

186
00:25:41,596 --> 00:25:43,722
not in this charged climate.

187
00:25:44,766 --> 00:25:47,184
So you're firing me.

188
00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:51,564
A leave of absence is all.
An indefinite leave of absence.

189
00:25:51,648 --> 00:25:53,190
- You are firing me.
- During which ...

190
00:25:53,275 --> 00:25:56,110
they've agreed to continue to pay
your full salary for a period ...

191
00:25:56,194 --> 00:25:57,653
I don't want their money!

192
00:25:57,737 --> 00:26:00,239
Please don't be foolish.

193
00:26:00,323 --> 00:26:02,241
You don't know what I had to go
through to get that for you.

194
00:26:02,325 --> 00:26:05,578
You went through? What exactly
did you have to go through, Charlie?

195
00:26:05,662 --> 00:26:07,037
Henry ...

196
00:26:09,165 --> 00:26:11,041
I resigned.

197
00:26:18,758 --> 00:26:20,426
Where will you go?

198
00:26:21,886 --> 00:26:25,556
Train to New York,
overnight to London, for starts.

199
00:26:26,683 --> 00:26:30,978
I might end up teaching in Leipzig.
Heinrich owes me a favor.

200
00:26:31,062 --> 00:26:32,438
I'll wire you when I get settled.

201
00:26:32,522 --> 00:26:34,231
You can send on
the rest of my things.

202
00:26:34,357 --> 00:26:36,483
I suppose
there's nothing to keep you here.

203
00:26:36,568 --> 00:26:38,527
I barely recognize
this country anymore.

204
00:26:38,612 --> 00:26:41,697
The government's got us
seeing Communists in our soup.

205
00:26:41,781 --> 00:26:46,327
When the hysteria reaches academia,
I guess it's time to call it a career.

206
00:26:46,411 --> 00:26:48,454
How did Deirdre take the news?

207
00:26:48,538 --> 00:26:50,831
How does any wife take such things?

208
00:26:50,915 --> 00:26:54,084
The look on her face was
a combination of pride and panic.

209
00:26:54,169 --> 00:26:57,129
I never should've doubted you,
my friend.

210
00:26:57,213 --> 00:27:00,966
No, you have reason to question
your friends these days.

211
00:27:05,555 --> 00:27:08,015
Brutal couple of years, huh, Charlie?

212
00:27:09,976 --> 00:27:12,686
First Dad, then Marcus.

213
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:16,148
We seem to have reached the age
where life stops giving us things ...

214
00:27:16,232 --> 00:27:18,400
and starts taking them away.

215
00:27:21,571 --> 00:27:23,739
Just another half glass.

216
00:28:21,923 --> 00:28:23,132
Hey!

217
00:28:24,968 --> 00:28:26,468
Hey, old man!

218
00:28:27,637 --> 00:28:31,682
Professor, hello! Hey!
Are you Dr. Jones?

219
00:28:31,766 --> 00:28:33,559
You're running out of platform, kid.

220
00:28:33,643 --> 00:28:35,853
Are you a friend of Dr. Oxley's?

221
00:28:35,937 --> 00:28:38,313
- Harold Oxley? The archeologist?
- Yeah.

222
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:39,940
What about him?

223
00:28:40,984 --> 00:28:42,109
They're going to kill him.

224
00:28:44,863 --> 00:28:47,865
I haven't talked to Harold Oxley
in 20 years.

225
00:28:49,242 --> 00:28:51,493
He's a brilliant guy.

226
00:28:51,578 --> 00:28:54,455
He could put you to sleep
just by talking.

227
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:57,624
Yeah. Yeah. When I was a kid,
that's how I did get to sleep.

228
00:28:57,709 --> 00:29:01,628
Oxley's voice was better than
a glass of warm milk, you know.

229
00:29:01,713 --> 00:29:03,672
The name's Mutt, Mutt Williams.

230
00:29:03,757 --> 00:29:06,925
- Mutt? What kind of name is that?
- Yeah.

231
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:09,052
It's the one I picked.
You got a problem with it?

232
00:29:09,137 --> 00:29:13,432
Take it easy.
What was your relationship to Oxley?

233
00:29:13,516 --> 00:29:18,020
My dad died in the war.
Ox kind of helped my mom raise me.

234
00:29:18,104 --> 00:29:21,064
You were saying
somebody's going to kill him?

235
00:29:23,735 --> 00:29:27,070
Six months ago,
my mom gets a letter from the Ox.

236
00:29:27,155 --> 00:29:28,614
He's down in Peru.

237
00:29:28,698 --> 00:29:31,408
Found some type of skull,
a crystal skull.

238
00:29:31,493 --> 00:29:35,120
Like the one that guy
Mitchell-Hodgkiss? Hedgkiss?

239
00:29:35,205 --> 00:29:37,539
- The one he found.
- Nice jacket.

240
00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:42,961
The Ox and I were obsessed with
the Mitchell-Hedges skull in college.

241
00:29:43,046 --> 00:29:44,213
How do you know about it?

242
00:29:44,297 --> 00:29:45,589
Are you kidding?
It's all he talked about.

243
00:29:45,673 --> 00:29:47,466
He'd talk about that thing
till the cows come home.

244
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:49,468
What's it? It's like an idol?

245
00:29:49,552 --> 00:29:52,346
Deity carving. Mesoamerican.

246
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:54,556
There are a number of crystal skulls
in the world.

247
00:29:54,641 --> 00:29:57,392
I saw one in the British Museum.

248
00:29:57,727 --> 00:30:01,355
Interesting craftsmanship,
but that's about it.

249
00:30:01,439 --> 00:30:04,274
All right, well, laugh if you want.
Oxley said he found it this time.

250
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:08,320
He said this was real and he was off
to a place called Akator with it.

251
00:30:08,404 --> 00:30:11,156
- Akator? He said that? You're sure?
- Yeah.

252
00:30:11,241 --> 00:30:14,910
That's what he said.
He said Akator. What is it?

253
00:30:14,994 --> 00:30:18,622
It's a mythical lost city
in the Amazon.

254
00:30:18,706 --> 00:30:21,667
Conquistadors called it El Dorado.

255
00:30:21,751 --> 00:30:25,838
Supposedly, the Ugha tribe were
chosen by the gods 7,000 years ago ...

256
00:30:25,922 --> 00:30:29,675
to build a giant city
out of solid gold.

257
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:32,344
It had aqueducts and paved roads ...

258
00:30:32,428 --> 00:30:37,516
and technology that wouldn't
be seen again for 5,000 years.

259
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:42,604
Francisco de Orellana disappeared
into the Amazon looking for it in 1546.

260
00:30:43,606 --> 00:30:46,608
I almost died of typhus
looking for it myself.

261
00:30:48,111 --> 00:30:49,486
I don't think it exists.

262
00:30:49,571 --> 00:30:52,447
Why would Ox
want to take the skull there?

263
00:30:52,532 --> 00:30:56,368
The legend says that a crystal
skull was stolen from Akator ...

264
00:30:56,452 --> 00:30:58,370
in the 15th or 16th century,

265
00:30:58,454 --> 00:31:02,082
and that whoever returns
the skull to the city temple ...

266
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:04,376
will be given control over its power.

267
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:08,297
Power. Right. So there's some
kind of power. What's the power?

268
00:31:08,381 --> 00:31:11,466
I don't know, kid.
It's just a story.

269
00:31:11,551 --> 00:31:12,718
No.

270
00:31:13,595 --> 00:31:15,721
From his letter, my mom thought
the Ox was off his rocker.

271
00:31:15,805 --> 00:31:16,847
You know, smog in the noggin,

272
00:31:16,931 --> 00:31:20,225
so she goes down there to find him,
only he'd already been kidnapped.

273
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:22,060
Now they've got her, too.

274
00:31:22,145 --> 00:31:23,604
Now, Ox said
he hid that skull someplace,

275
00:31:23,688 --> 00:31:26,940
and if my mom doesn't come up with it,
they're gonna kill them both.

276
00:31:27,025 --> 00:31:29,151
Now, she said you'd help me.

277
00:31:29,903 --> 00:31:32,070
Me? What's your mom's name again?

278
00:31:32,155 --> 00:31:34,907
Mary. Mary Williams.
You remember her?

279
00:31:34,991 --> 00:31:36,241
There were a lot of Marys, kid.

280
00:31:36,326 --> 00:31:38,452
Shut up! That's my mother
you're talking about!

281
00:31:38,536 --> 00:31:40,329
All right? That's my mother.

282
00:31:40,413 --> 00:31:43,415
You don't have to get sore all the
time just to prove how tough you are.

283
00:31:43,499 --> 00:31:45,667
Sit down. Please. Sit down.

284
00:31:47,003 --> 00:31:49,963
She said if anybody could find
the skull, it's you.

285
00:31:50,048 --> 00:31:54,593
Like you're some type of ...
Like a grave robber or something.

286
00:31:54,677 --> 00:31:57,512
I'm a tenured professor of archeology.

287
00:31:57,597 --> 00:32:01,850
Oh, you're a teacher.
Well, that's gonna be a big help.

288
00:32:01,935 --> 00:32:03,936
Anyway, she called me
two weeks ago from South America.

289
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,521
Said she'd escaped,
but they were after her.

290
00:32:06,606 --> 00:32:08,273
She said she'd just gotten
a letter from the Ox ...

291
00:32:08,358 --> 00:32:10,359
and mailed it to me
so I could give it to you.

292
00:32:10,443 --> 00:32:11,818
Then the line went dead.
I opened it.

293
00:32:11,903 --> 00:32:14,363
I mean, the thing's pointless,
though. It's just gibberish.

294
00:32:14,447 --> 00:32:16,823
It's not even English lettering.

295
00:32:16,908 --> 00:32:18,075
See?

296
00:32:19,911 --> 00:32:23,246
See those two bricks over there,
at the counter?

297
00:32:23,331 --> 00:32:25,916
I don't think
they're here for the milkshakes.

298
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,501
Who are they?

299
00:32:28,294 --> 00:32:31,213
Don't know. Maybe FBI.

300
00:32:31,297 --> 00:32:33,048
Come quietly, Dr. Jones.

301
00:32:33,132 --> 00:32:34,549
Make that KGB.

302
00:32:34,634 --> 00:32:37,719
- And bring letter with you.
- Letter? What letter?

303
00:32:37,804 --> 00:32:39,137
Letter Mr. Williams just give you.

304
00:32:39,222 --> 00:32:41,139
Me? Do I look like a mailman?

305
00:32:41,224 --> 00:32:42,975
We don't ask again.
Come now or we'll ...

306
00:32:43,059 --> 00:32:44,226
Or what?

307
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:47,562
Nice try, kid, but I think
you just brought a knife ...

308
00:32:48,898 --> 00:32:51,149
to a gunfight.

309
00:32:51,234 --> 00:32:52,901
Outside now.

310
00:32:57,323 --> 00:32:58,490
- Hit this guy.
- Who?

311
00:32:58,574 --> 00:33:00,033
Joe College. Hit him hard.

312
00:33:00,118 --> 00:33:02,077
- Here, hold this.
- What?

313
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:04,913
That's my boyfriend!

314
00:33:08,251 --> 00:33:09,835
Take it outside!

315
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:11,753
Get that greaser!

316
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:20,887
Your mom didn't escape.

317
00:33:20,972 --> 00:33:23,765
They let her go,
so she could mail the letter ...

318
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:27,102
and you could bring it to me
and I could translate it!

319
00:33:29,272 --> 00:33:31,106
Get on, gramps!

320
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:01,887
Go, go, go, go, go!

321
00:35:11,624 --> 00:35:24,511
Better dead than Red!
Better dead than Red!

322
00:35:26,055 --> 00:35:29,558
This is crazy!
Somebody's going to get hurt!

323
00:35:57,545 --> 00:35:59,212
Left! Go left! Left!

324
00:36:14,395 --> 00:36:16,188
Move, move! Move!

325
00:36:16,898 --> 00:36:18,190
Split, split! Split, split!

326
00:36:18,274 --> 00:36:20,692
- You're going too fast.
- That's a matter of opinion!

327
00:36:33,831 --> 00:36:36,666
- Excuse me, Dr. Jones.
- Yes?

328
00:36:36,751 --> 00:36:40,086
I just had a question on
Hargrove's normative culture model.

329
00:36:40,171 --> 00:36:41,546
Forget Hargrove.

330
00:36:41,631 --> 00:36:44,716
Read Vere Gordon Childe
on diffusionism.

331
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,968
He spent most of his life
in the field.

332
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:50,972
If you want to be
a good archeologist,

333
00:36:52,099 --> 00:36:54,643
you got to get out of the library!

334
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,482
Who is that?

335
00:37:00,566 --> 00:37:03,693
Francisco de Orellana,
the conquistador.

336
00:37:03,778 --> 00:37:06,029
Remember, the guy who got lost
looking for the skull.

337
00:37:06,113 --> 00:37:09,616
And just as I thought.

338
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,701
Koihoma.

339
00:37:11,786 --> 00:37:13,245
What's that?

340
00:37:13,329 --> 00:37:18,333
It's an extinct Latin American language.
Pre-Columbian syllabic base.

341
00:37:19,585 --> 00:37:23,630
See. Diagonal stresses on the
ideograms. Definitely Koihoma.

342
00:37:23,714 --> 00:37:25,590
- You speak it?
- Nobody speaks it.

343
00:37:25,675 --> 00:37:29,010
It hasn't been heard aloud
in 3,000 years.

344
00:37:29,095 --> 00:37:33,348
I might be able to read a bit though
if I walk it through Mayan first.

345
00:37:34,183 --> 00:37:36,643
You know, for an old man,
you ain't bad in a fight.

346
00:37:36,727 --> 00:37:38,478
Thanks a lot.

347
00:37:38,562 --> 00:37:40,522
What are you, like, 80?

348
00:37:43,901 --> 00:37:46,069
It's a riddle.

349
00:37:46,153 --> 00:37:49,698
Leave it to Ox to write a riddle
in a dead language.

350
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,287
"Follow the lines in the earth
only gods can read ...

351
00:37:55,371 --> 00:37:58,456
"which lead to Orellana's cradle ...

352
00:37:58,541 --> 00:38:00,792
"guarded by the living dead."

353
00:38:00,876 --> 00:38:03,795
- He's talking about the Nazca Lines.
- What are those?

354
00:38:03,879 --> 00:38:05,213
Hold on here.

355
00:38:06,007 --> 00:38:12,470
Geoglyphs. Giant ancient drawings
carved into the desert floor in Peru.

356
00:38:12,555 --> 00:38:15,307
From the ground,
they don't look like anything.

357
00:38:15,391 --> 00:38:19,019
But from the sky,
only the gods can read them,

358
00:38:19,103 --> 00:38:21,938
because only gods live up there.

359
00:38:23,899 --> 00:38:29,154
Oxley's telling us
the skull is in Nazca, Peru.

360
00:39:30,966 --> 00:39:33,093
Finally. They saw him.

361
00:39:33,177 --> 00:39:36,054
Ox wandered into town a couple of
months ago, raving like a madman.

362
00:39:36,138 --> 00:39:38,556
Police locked him up
in the sanitarium. It's this way.

363
00:39:38,641 --> 00:39:41,059
I took Spanish and I didn't understand
a word of that. What was it?

364
00:39:41,143 --> 00:39:43,353
Quechua, local Incan dialect.

365
00:39:43,437 --> 00:39:46,022
- Where'd you learn that one?
- Long story.

366
00:39:46,107 --> 00:39:47,690
I got time.

367
00:39:47,775 --> 00:39:50,193
I rode with Pancho Villa.
A couple of his guys spoke it.

368
00:39:50,277 --> 00:39:51,945
Bullshit!

369
00:39:52,029 --> 00:39:54,280
- You asked.
- Pancho Villa?

370
00:39:54,365 --> 00:39:57,534
- Technically, I was kidnapped.
- By Pancho Villa?

371
00:39:57,618 --> 00:40:01,079
It was the fight
against Victoriano Huerta.

372
00:40:01,163 --> 00:40:03,373
- How old were you?
- About your age.

373
00:40:03,457 --> 00:40:05,959
Your parents must've had a cow, huh?

374
00:40:06,043 --> 00:40:08,211
It worked out.
Things were a little tense at home.

375
00:40:08,295 --> 00:40:10,171
Yeah, me and my mom
aren't on the best of terms, either.

376
00:40:10,256 --> 00:40:13,716
Treat her right, kid. You only get
one and sometimes not for that long.

377
00:40:13,801 --> 00:40:15,093
It's not my fault. It's hers.

378
00:40:15,177 --> 00:40:16,803
She just got P.O.'ed
because I quit school.

379
00:40:16,887 --> 00:40:18,388
She thinks I'm some
kind of goof or something.

380
00:40:18,472 --> 00:40:20,682
- You quit school?
- Oh, yeah. Sure. Tons of them.

381
00:40:20,766 --> 00:40:22,934
Fancy prep schools
that teach you how to debate

382
00:40:23,018 --> 00:40:24,686
and chess and fencing.

383
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:26,938
I'm great with the blade.
I just think it's a waste of time.

384
00:40:27,022 --> 00:40:29,107
- You never finished.
- No.

385
00:40:29,191 --> 00:40:31,818
Just a bunch of useless skills.
Wrong books.

386
00:40:31,902 --> 00:40:34,279
'Cause I love reading.
Me and Ox used to read all the time.

387
00:40:34,363 --> 00:40:36,781
But now I can pick them myself.
You get me?

388
00:40:36,866 --> 00:40:39,492
- What do you do for money?
- Fix motorcycles.

389
00:40:39,577 --> 00:40:42,287
Gonna do that
for the rest of your life?

390
00:40:42,371 --> 00:40:44,956
Maybe I will, Teach.
You got a problem with that?

391
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,459
No. Not if that's
what you love doing.

392
00:40:47,543 --> 00:40:50,420
Don't let anybody tell you different.

393
00:40:50,504 --> 00:40:52,338
This is it. Sister.

394
00:41:12,193 --> 00:41:15,612
She says Ox isn't here.
She doesn't know where he is.

395
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:20,742
Some men came and took him away,
men with guns.

396
00:41:26,081 --> 00:41:27,999
She says he was obsessed, deranged.

397
00:41:28,083 --> 00:41:30,585
Drew pictures
all over the walls of his cell.

398
00:41:34,757 --> 00:41:38,176
This riddle in Oxley's letter
doesn't make any sense.

399
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:43,932
"Follow the lines that only the gods
can read that lead to Orellana's cradle."

400
00:41:44,016 --> 00:41:46,309
Cradle, cradle, birth.

401
00:41:46,393 --> 00:41:49,395
Orellana wasn't born in Peru.
He was born in Spain.

402
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,397
He was a conquistador.
He came here for the gold.

403
00:41:51,482 --> 00:41:52,899
What happened to him?

404
00:41:52,983 --> 00:41:57,237
He disappeared along with six others.
Their bodies were never found.

405
00:42:26,475 --> 00:42:28,685
He must have lost his mind.

406
00:42:35,317 --> 00:42:38,695
Ox, man, what happened?
What happened?

407
00:42:46,412 --> 00:42:49,539
This is not the Mitchell-Hedges skull.

408
00:42:49,623 --> 00:42:51,958
Look at the elongated cranium.

409
00:42:52,751 --> 00:42:54,794
And the same word ...

410
00:42:54,878 --> 00:42:57,130
in different languages,
over and over again.

411
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:03,261
Return.

412
00:43:03,345 --> 00:43:05,096
Return where?

413
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:07,223
Or return what?

414
00:43:07,308 --> 00:43:09,809
You mean the skull?

415
00:43:09,893 --> 00:43:12,437
Seems to have been on his mind.

416
00:43:12,521 --> 00:43:15,189
Where was he supposed to return it to?

417
00:43:27,536 --> 00:43:29,162
- Sweep.
- Yeah.

418
00:43:38,756 --> 00:43:41,424
Ox didn't mean Orellana's birthplace.

419
00:43:41,508 --> 00:43:43,926
Cradle has another meaning in Mayan.

420
00:43:44,011 --> 00:43:48,973
Literally, it means "resting place,"
as in final resting place.

421
00:43:49,058 --> 00:43:51,476
Ox meant Orellana's grave.

422
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:56,606
This drawing scratched into the floor
is the cemetery where he's buried.

423
00:43:57,066 --> 00:43:59,651
You said Orellana vanished
and nobody ever found his grave.

424
00:43:59,735 --> 00:44:03,571
Well, it looks like Harold Oxley did.

425
00:44:34,436 --> 00:44:36,521
"Grave robbers will be shot."

426
00:44:36,605 --> 00:44:38,564
Good thing we're not grave robbers.

427
00:44:46,532 --> 00:44:49,742
- What are we looking for?
- I don't know yet.

428
00:44:50,244 --> 00:44:53,705
Maybe an antechamber
off one of these barrows.

429
00:45:09,471 --> 00:45:11,055
I think I just saw something!

430
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:13,474
Oh, you're jumping at shadows.

431
00:45:18,105 --> 00:45:20,064
This way down.

432
00:45:28,907 --> 00:45:31,534
- This way up.
- Yeah.

433
00:45:55,809 --> 00:45:57,727
Those darts are poison!

434
00:45:59,396 --> 00:46:00,897
Stay there.

435
00:46:25,297 --> 00:46:27,965
You're a teacher?

436
00:46:29,134 --> 00:46:30,468
Part-time.

437
00:46:40,479 --> 00:46:41,813
Dead end.

438
00:46:43,899 --> 00:46:45,399
Maybe.

439
00:46:51,782 --> 00:46:53,032
What are you doing?
Put that thing away.

440
00:46:53,116 --> 00:46:55,576
Give me some light over here.

441
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,334
Bring it over here.

442
00:47:10,259 --> 00:47:12,009
It's just a thing.

443
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:13,613
Dance on your own dime, will you?

444
00:48:13,697 --> 00:48:15,740
One of the scorpions just stung me!
Am I gonna die?

445
00:48:15,824 --> 00:48:17,950
- How big?
- Huge!

446
00:48:18,035 --> 00:48:19,577
- Good.
- Good?

447
00:48:21,038 --> 00:48:23,915
When it comes to scorpions,
the bigger the better.

448
00:48:23,999 --> 00:48:27,418
A small one bites you,
don't keep it to yourself.

449
00:48:48,273 --> 00:48:52,401
Their skulls.
Look at their skulls, man.

450
00:48:52,486 --> 00:48:56,113
Like the drawings in Oxley's cell.
Means we're getting closer.

451
00:48:56,198 --> 00:48:58,282
That's crazy. Why is it like that?

452
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:01,786
Nazca Indians used to
bind their infants' heads with rope

453
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:03,496
to elongate the skull like that.

454
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:06,207
- Why?
- Honor the gods.

455
00:49:06,291 --> 00:49:09,543
No, no.
God's head is not like that, man.

456
00:49:09,628 --> 00:49:11,754
Depends on who your god is.

457
00:49:21,807 --> 00:49:23,891
You're going nowhere fast.

458
00:49:28,855 --> 00:49:31,357
Professor, this really
is a dead end. Look.

459
00:49:38,532 --> 00:49:39,657
Hey!

460
00:49:56,842 --> 00:49:59,927
Come on, genius.
Bring the backpack.

461
00:50:17,529 --> 00:50:20,322
- This is incredible.
- Unreal.

462
00:50:23,118 --> 00:50:25,286
Don't touch anything.

463
00:50:28,206 --> 00:50:30,624
Footprints. Somebody's been here.

464
00:50:32,169 --> 00:50:33,627
Recently.

465
00:50:36,673 --> 00:50:38,340
Two sets of prints.

466
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,554
Same size, could have been
the same person twice.

467
00:50:43,638 --> 00:50:45,139
Not bad, kid.

468
00:50:53,148 --> 00:50:56,776
One. Two.

469
00:50:56,860 --> 00:51:00,237
Three. Four. Five. Six.

470
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:03,365
Seven.

471
00:51:04,076 --> 00:51:08,162
Orellana and his men might've
made it out of the jungle after all.

472
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:12,374
Give me some light.

473
00:51:18,507 --> 00:51:20,925
You don't have a knife, do you?

474
00:51:44,199 --> 00:51:45,991
Looks like he just died yesterday.

475
00:51:46,076 --> 00:51:48,828
It's the wrappings.
They preserved him.

476
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:58,462
What just happened?

477
00:51:58,547 --> 00:52:02,508
He's been wrapped up for 500 years.
Air doesn't agree with him.

478
00:52:10,183 --> 00:52:11,559
Thanks.

479
00:52:15,897 --> 00:52:17,773
I don't want to keep
borrowing yours all the time.

480
00:52:17,858 --> 00:52:20,860
- That's fine.
- I was going to put it back.

481
00:52:26,575 --> 00:52:28,617
Is this one open already?

482
00:52:47,679 --> 00:52:50,181
It's him.

483
00:52:50,348 --> 00:52:52,600
It's Orellana himself.

484
00:52:57,564 --> 00:53:01,901
They called him The Gilded Man.
His lust for gold was legendary.

485
00:53:03,612 --> 00:53:04,987
It's odd.

486
00:53:07,741 --> 00:53:10,159
Somebody's been here and gone.

487
00:53:10,243 --> 00:53:16,290
But they left all this gold
and all the artifacts.

488
00:53:18,335 --> 00:53:20,544
What were they looking for?

489
00:53:33,642 --> 00:53:35,434
- Hold this.
- No. No.

490
00:53:54,871 --> 00:53:57,998
Unbelievable.

491
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,634
No tool marks.

492
00:54:08,718 --> 00:54:11,345
A single piece of seamless quartz.

493
00:54:13,139 --> 00:54:15,766
Cut across the grain.

494
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:19,979
It's not possible, even with
today's technology, it would shatter.

495
00:54:26,486 --> 00:54:28,529
Crystal's not magnetic.

496
00:54:28,613 --> 00:54:30,197
Neither is gold.

497
00:54:34,077 --> 00:54:36,745
What is this thing?

498
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:40,958
Maybe the Nazca Indians thought
this was their god.

499
00:54:41,042 --> 00:54:43,877
- You think this is the one from ...
- From Akator.

500
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:53,137
Maybe the Spaniards found this skull
along with all this other loot.

501
00:54:53,221 --> 00:54:56,640
They were headed for their ships
along the shore.

502
00:54:58,059 --> 00:55:01,020
Maybe the Indians
caught up with them,

503
00:55:01,104 --> 00:55:03,647
or they got to squabbling
amongst themselves ...

504
00:55:03,732 --> 00:55:07,192
over their prize,
kill each other off.

505
00:55:07,277 --> 00:55:10,529
The Indians wrap them up
and bury them.

506
00:55:10,613 --> 00:55:15,701
A couple of hundred years later,
Oxley shows up here, finds the skull.

507
00:55:15,785 --> 00:55:19,413
Takes it away, maybe to Akator.

508
00:55:22,083 --> 00:55:24,585
But then he returns it here.

509
00:55:24,669 --> 00:55:26,378
Return.

510
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:29,631
Return, like he wrote
on the walls of his cell.

511
00:55:30,425 --> 00:55:34,595
He put it back
where he found it. Why?

512
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:02,247
- Hello, Jonesey.
- Hello, Mac.

513
00:56:35,031 --> 00:56:36,907
You're lucky I turned up, Jonesey.

514
00:56:36,991 --> 00:56:39,243
Dovchenko there wanted
to blow your brains out.

515
00:56:39,327 --> 00:56:42,871
That's the third time
I've saved your life.

516
00:56:42,956 --> 00:56:45,082
Unshackle me.
I'll give you a big hug.

517
00:56:45,166 --> 00:56:48,085
You had a Luger
pointed at the base of your skull

518
00:56:48,169 --> 00:56:49,920
the first time we met.

519
00:56:50,004 --> 00:56:51,880
I had the situation under control.

520
00:56:51,965 --> 00:56:54,466
- You owe me.
- What do you owe them?

521
00:56:56,803 --> 00:56:58,011
After the war, when you turned,

522
00:56:58,096 --> 00:56:59,263
how many names
did you give the Reds?

523
00:56:59,347 --> 00:57:00,722
You're not looking
at the big picture here.

524
00:57:00,807 --> 00:57:02,808
How many good men died
because of you?

525
00:57:02,892 --> 00:57:05,185
Eventually, they're gonna
let me out of this chair, comrade,

526
00:57:05,270 --> 00:57:08,647
and when they do,
I'm going to break your nose.

527
00:57:08,731 --> 00:57:12,067
"Comrade"?
You think this is about flags?

528
00:57:12,152 --> 00:57:14,528
About uniforms? You think
this is about lines on a map?

529
00:57:14,612 --> 00:57:16,405
It's just about money, isn't it?

530
00:57:16,489 --> 00:57:18,282
No. Not only money.

531
00:57:21,369 --> 00:57:23,787
A gigantic pile of money.

532
00:57:24,539 --> 00:57:26,957
Don't worry about
what the Russians will pay.

533
00:57:27,041 --> 00:57:30,043
It's nothing compared
to what's at Akator.

534
00:57:31,254 --> 00:57:35,632
An entire city of gold. It's what
the conquistadors were after.

535
00:57:36,885 --> 00:57:41,555
For God's sake, Jonesey, we'd be rich!
Richer than Howard Hughes!

536
00:57:41,639 --> 00:57:44,141
Blood money, every nickel.

537
00:57:44,225 --> 00:57:46,435
I need you to see
the angle here, mate.

538
00:57:46,519 --> 00:57:49,396
Be smart. Do the right thing.
Just like in ...

539
00:57:51,232 --> 00:57:53,817
Like in Berlin. Got me?

540
00:57:53,902 --> 00:57:55,986
Just like in Berlin.

541
00:57:56,070 --> 00:57:59,323
You want me to trot off,
or should we sing a song?

542
00:58:00,492 --> 00:58:04,286
How fortunate our failure
to kill you, Dr. Jones.

543
00:58:04,370 --> 00:58:07,372
You survive
to be of service to us once again.

544
00:58:07,457 --> 00:58:10,417
Well, you know me,
always glad to help.

545
00:58:10,502 --> 00:58:15,088
"Now I am become death,
the destroyer of worlds."

546
00:58:15,924 --> 00:58:18,675
You recognize those words?

547
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:23,180
It was your own Dr. Oppenheimer
after he created the atomic bomb.

548
00:58:23,264 --> 00:58:24,681
He was quoting the Hindu bible.

549
00:58:24,766 --> 00:58:26,850
It was nuclear intimidation.

550
00:58:26,935 --> 00:58:30,938
But now this next level of weapon
is ours to have,

551
00:58:31,022 --> 00:58:32,940
yours to fear.

552
00:58:33,024 --> 00:58:35,526
Weapon? What weapon?

553
00:58:35,610 --> 00:58:37,361
A mind weapon.

554
00:58:37,445 --> 00:58:41,281
A new frontier of psychic warfare.
That was Stalin's dream.

555
00:58:43,952 --> 00:58:47,996
Now I know why Oxley put the
skull back where he found it.

556
00:58:48,081 --> 00:58:49,331
He knew you were looking for it.

557
00:58:49,415 --> 00:58:51,416
That skull is no mere deity carving.

558
00:58:51,501 --> 00:58:53,544
Surely you knew that
the moment you laid eyes on it.

559
00:58:53,628 --> 00:58:56,672
It was not made by human hands.

560
00:58:56,756 --> 00:58:58,507
Who made it, then?

561
00:59:01,761 --> 00:59:03,262
Come on.

562
00:59:04,681 --> 00:59:07,558
The body we found in New Mexico
was not the first.

563
00:59:07,642 --> 00:59:11,520
We'd already dissected two others
from similar crash sites in Soviet Union.

564
00:59:11,604 --> 00:59:13,355
Saucer men from Mars.

565
00:59:13,439 --> 00:59:15,566
The legends about Akator
are all true.

566
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:18,068
Early men could not have
conceived it, much less built it.

567
00:59:18,152 --> 00:59:20,320
It was a city of supreme beings ...

568
00:59:20,405 --> 00:59:23,490
with technologies
and paranormal abilities.

569
00:59:23,575 --> 00:59:25,951
You got to be kidding me.

570
00:59:26,035 --> 00:59:29,329
Why do you choose
not to believe your own eyes?

571
00:59:31,833 --> 00:59:34,918
The New Mexico specimen
gave us hope.

572
00:59:35,003 --> 00:59:39,881
Unlike the others we'd found,
its skeleton was pure crystal.

573
00:59:41,676 --> 00:59:45,846
A distant cousin, perhaps. Maybe they,
too, were sent to find Akator.

574
00:59:45,930 --> 00:59:49,016
Perhaps we're all searching
for the same thing.

575
00:59:51,477 --> 00:59:56,064
- There is no other explanation.
- There's always another explanation.

576
00:59:56,149 --> 01:00:00,402
The skull was stolen from Akator
in the 15th century.

577
01:00:00,486 --> 01:00:01,612
Whoever returns it ...

578
01:00:01,696 --> 01:00:04,114
Returns it to the city temple
will gain control over its powers.

579
01:00:04,198 --> 01:00:07,159
I've heard that bedtime story before.

580
01:00:07,243 --> 01:00:10,287
It's a legend.
Why do you think Akator even existed?

581
01:00:10,371 --> 01:00:12,789
You should ask your friend
that question.

582
01:00:12,874 --> 01:00:15,167
We're certain he's been there.

583
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:17,419
Oxley?

584
01:00:32,143 --> 01:00:34,478
Ox, it's me, Indy.

585
01:00:35,313 --> 01:00:36,813
Ox?

586
01:00:38,358 --> 01:00:40,776
Ox, you're faking it, right?

587
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:43,779
"Through eyes
that last I saw in tears ..."

588
01:00:43,863 --> 01:00:47,866
Ox, listen to me, pal.
Your name is Harold Oxley.

589
01:00:47,950 --> 01:00:49,409
You were born in Leeds, England.

590
01:00:49,494 --> 01:00:52,245
You and I went to school together
at the University of Chicago.

591
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:55,582
And you were never this interesting.
My name is ...

592
01:00:57,085 --> 01:00:59,753
My name is Henry Jones, Jr.

593
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:02,255
What have you done to him?

594
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:04,591
We ain't done a thing.
It's the bloody skull.

595
01:01:04,676 --> 01:01:07,886
He is the divining rod
that will lead us to Akator.

596
01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:10,389
But we need someone
to interpret him for us.

597
01:01:10,473 --> 01:01:15,185
His mind, it seems, is quite weak.
Let's hope yours is stronger.

598
01:01:17,939 --> 01:01:22,275
The skull's crystal stimulates an
undeveloped part of the human brain,

599
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:24,528
opening a psychic channel.

600
01:01:24,612 --> 01:01:28,699
Oxley lost control of his mind
by staring too long into its eyes.

601
01:01:28,783 --> 01:01:33,370
We believe you can get through to
him after you have done the same.

602
01:01:33,454 --> 01:01:36,206
I've got a better idea.
You look at it.

603
01:01:36,290 --> 01:01:39,418
The skull does not speak
to everyone, it seems.

604
01:01:40,795 --> 01:01:43,380
Surely you're not afraid,
Dr. Jones.

605
01:01:43,464 --> 01:01:46,049
You've spent your entire life
searching for answers.

606
01:01:46,134 --> 01:01:49,219
Think of the truth behind those eyes.

607
01:01:49,303 --> 01:01:51,888
There may be
hundreds of skulls at Akator.

608
01:01:51,973 --> 01:01:54,558
Whoever finds them will control
the greatest natural force ...

609
01:01:54,642 --> 01:01:56,810
the world has ever known.

610
01:01:59,147 --> 01:02:01,690
Power over the mind of man.

611
01:02:01,774 --> 01:02:05,402
Be careful, you might get
exactly what you wish for.

612
01:02:05,486 --> 01:02:06,987
I usually do.

613
01:02:40,188 --> 01:02:42,606
Imagine.

614
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:46,359
To peer across the world
and know the enemy's secrets.

615
01:02:46,444 --> 01:02:49,696
To place our thoughts
into the minds of your leaders.

616
01:02:49,781 --> 01:02:52,365
Make your teachers
teach the true version of history,

617
01:02:52,450 --> 01:02:55,160
your soldiers attack on our command.

618
01:02:55,369 --> 01:02:58,163
We'll be everywhere at once,
more powerful than a whisper,

619
01:02:58,247 --> 01:02:59,623
invading your dreams,

620
01:02:59,707 --> 01:03:02,876
thinking your thoughts for you
while you sleep.

621
01:03:04,754 --> 01:03:07,631
We will change you, Dr. Jones,

622
01:03:07,715 --> 01:03:10,509
all of you, from the inside.

623
01:03:10,593 --> 01:03:13,303
We will turn you into us.

624
01:03:13,387 --> 01:03:18,225
And the best part?
You won't even know it's happening.

625
01:03:20,561 --> 01:03:21,853
Return.

626
01:03:24,732 --> 01:03:26,066
Return?

627
01:03:29,445 --> 01:03:30,987
That's enough.

628
01:03:33,741 --> 01:03:36,827
That's enough.
If he dies, we can't get there.

629
01:03:38,037 --> 01:03:39,371
Cover it.

630
01:03:44,544 --> 01:03:45,919
Henry.

631
01:03:46,629 --> 01:03:48,713
You all right, Jonesey?

632
01:03:54,428 --> 01:03:55,846
- You broke my nose!
- I told you.

633
01:03:55,930 --> 01:04:00,642
Enough! You will speak to Oxley
and lead us to Akator, yes?

634
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:04,271
Take him outside.

635
01:04:10,152 --> 01:04:12,779
- You all right, kid?
- They left my bike at the cemetery.

636
01:04:12,864 --> 01:04:14,698
- Yeah, but you're all right?
- They left my bike.

637
01:04:14,782 --> 01:04:18,243
Whoa! Whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop.

638
01:04:26,502 --> 01:04:30,380
I'm ready.
Don't give these pigs a thing.

639
01:04:30,464 --> 01:04:32,048
You heard him.

640
01:04:32,133 --> 01:04:35,635
Clearly I have chosen
the wrong pressure point.

641
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:38,513
Perhaps I can find
a more sensitive one.

642
01:04:39,974 --> 01:04:44,269
Get your hands off me,
you rotten Russki son of a bitch!

643
01:04:47,481 --> 01:04:49,316
Indiana Jones.

644
01:04:53,237 --> 01:04:54,613
About time you showed up.

645
01:04:54,697 --> 01:04:56,573
- Mom!
- Sweetheart.

646
01:04:56,657 --> 01:04:58,325
"Mom"?

647
01:04:58,409 --> 01:04:59,743
What are you doing here?

648
01:04:59,827 --> 01:05:01,912
Forget about me. Are you all right?

649
01:05:01,996 --> 01:05:04,247
- "Mom"?
- Young man, I specifically told you ...

650
01:05:04,332 --> 01:05:05,916
not to come here.
- Marion is your mother?

651
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,043
You never wrote that. You never
said that in any phone calls.

652
01:05:08,127 --> 01:05:10,295
Marion Ravenwood is your mother?

653
01:05:10,379 --> 01:05:13,590
For God's sake, Indy,
it's not that hard.

654
01:05:13,674 --> 01:05:15,592
No, I mean, I just never thought ...

655
01:05:15,676 --> 01:05:17,260
I would have a life after you left.

656
01:05:17,345 --> 01:05:19,846
- That's not what I meant.
- A damn good life!

657
01:05:19,931 --> 01:05:23,516
- Well, that's fine.
- A damn good, really good life!

658
01:05:23,601 --> 01:05:25,101
- Well, so have I!
- Yeah?

659
01:05:25,186 --> 01:05:26,978
You still leaving
a trail of human wreckage,

660
01:05:27,063 --> 01:05:28,480
or have you retired?

661
01:05:28,564 --> 01:05:30,065
Why? You looking for a date?

662
01:05:30,149 --> 01:05:32,400
With anybody but you.

663
01:05:32,485 --> 01:05:36,029
So, Dr. Jones, you will help us?

664
01:05:36,113 --> 01:05:37,572
A simple "yes" will do.

665
01:05:37,657 --> 01:05:40,116
Oh, Marion, you had to go
and get yourself kidnapped.

666
01:05:40,201 --> 01:05:42,369
Not like you did any better.

667
01:05:43,955 --> 01:05:45,747
Same old, same old.

668
01:05:47,959 --> 01:05:50,126
Henry Jones, Jr.

669
01:05:51,837 --> 01:05:55,340
- Henry Jones, Jr. ...
- That's right, Ox. Listen to me.

670
01:05:55,424 --> 01:05:58,426
"To lay their just hands
on that Golden Key ...

671
01:05:58,511 --> 01:06:01,346
"that ope's the Palace of Eternity."
- Palace of ...

672
01:06:01,430 --> 01:06:03,932
It's from Milton.
He's said it before. Why?

673
01:06:04,016 --> 01:06:06,518
Ox, you got to tell us
how to get to Akator ...

674
01:06:06,602 --> 01:06:08,019
or they're gonna kill Marion.

675
01:06:08,104 --> 01:06:12,440
"Through eyes that last I saw in tears,
here in death's dream kingdom ..."

676
01:06:12,525 --> 01:06:15,068
Harold, they're gonna kill
Abner's little girl.

677
01:06:15,152 --> 01:06:18,279
You got to tell us how to get there.
We need ...

678
01:06:26,122 --> 01:06:27,914
Get me paper.
Something to write with.

679
01:06:39,093 --> 01:06:41,761
Autowriting!
I should have seen this.

680
01:06:45,766 --> 01:06:50,395
- Henry Jones, Jr.
- Right. That's right, Ox.

681
01:06:50,479 --> 01:06:55,025
Three times it drops.
The way down.

682
01:06:55,401 --> 01:06:57,944
- Three times ...
- Pictographs.

683
01:06:59,613 --> 01:07:01,197
Ideograms.

684
01:07:09,749 --> 01:07:11,332
Good, Ox. Good.

685
01:07:23,554 --> 01:07:25,221
Ox?

686
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:28,266
It's me, Ox.

687
01:07:28,350 --> 01:07:33,897
It's Mutt, Ox. Hey, look at me.
Look at me. It's me.

688
01:07:35,566 --> 01:07:36,816
It's me.

689
01:07:40,279 --> 01:07:44,199
The wavy lines mean water, of course.
Closed eyes mean sleep.

690
01:07:44,283 --> 01:07:48,578
The sun with the arc over the sky
stands for time, duration.

691
01:07:48,662 --> 01:07:51,247
The word "now" is "until."

692
01:07:51,332 --> 01:07:52,582
These two close together,

693
01:07:52,666 --> 01:07:56,086
the horizon and the snake,
mean one thought.

694
01:07:56,170 --> 01:07:58,171
The horizon stood for the world,

695
01:07:58,255 --> 01:08:01,549
but it didn't mean the Earth.
It meant big, great.

696
01:08:03,844 --> 01:08:07,597
"The water sleeps
until the great snake."

697
01:08:07,681 --> 01:08:10,725
These arenâ€™t just drawings,
they're directions. Get me a map!

698
01:08:15,106 --> 01:08:17,065
The great snake is the Amazon,
of course,

699
01:08:17,149 --> 01:08:20,193
but "sleep," what water sleeps?

700
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:27,659
Here! Sono.
The Portuguese word for "sleep."

701
01:08:27,743 --> 01:08:29,786
Yes, good. Exactly.

702
01:08:32,039 --> 01:08:35,875
He wants us
to follow this curve of the Sono ...

703
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:39,254
down to where it meets the Amazon
to the southeast.

704
01:08:39,338 --> 01:08:41,131
After that, I'm not sure.

705
01:08:41,215 --> 01:08:45,635
Kingdom of dreams, tears and eyes ...
I have no idea what he means.

706
01:08:45,719 --> 01:08:46,719
This could be the route, though.

707
01:08:46,804 --> 01:08:49,180
It's a completely unexplored part
of the canopy.

708
01:08:53,561 --> 01:08:55,687
Go, go, go, go, go! Come on!

709
01:09:02,236 --> 01:09:04,404
- Kid, what the hell are we doing, kid?
- They were going to kill us!

710
01:09:04,488 --> 01:09:06,739
- Well, maybe.
- Somebody had to do something!

711
01:09:06,824 --> 01:09:09,117
- Something else would have been good.
- At least I got a plan.

712
01:09:09,201 --> 01:09:12,579
This is intolerable.
Harold, for God's sake, keep up.

713
01:09:20,754 --> 01:09:21,754
Mom?

714
01:09:21,839 --> 01:09:24,674
- Stay back!
- Stop! Stop! Stop! Don't move.

715
01:09:24,758 --> 01:09:26,342
Moving makes space,
space will make you sink.

716
01:09:26,427 --> 01:09:27,677
No, I think I can get out
if I can just ...

717
01:09:27,761 --> 01:09:29,345
Stop it!
You're pulling against a vacuum.

718
01:09:29,430 --> 01:09:31,264
It's like trying to lift a car.
Just stay calm.

719
01:09:31,348 --> 01:09:32,515
Okay, I'm calm.

720
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:33,892
- What is it? Quicksand?
- I'm calm.

721
01:09:33,976 --> 01:09:35,977
- No, it's a dry sand pit.
- I'm sinking, but I'm calm.

722
01:09:36,061 --> 01:09:38,062
Quicksand is a mix of sand,
mud and water.

723
01:09:38,147 --> 01:09:40,023
And depending on the viscosity,
it's not as dangerous ...

724
01:09:40,107 --> 01:09:41,399
as people sometimes think.
- For Pete's sake, Jones,

725
01:09:41,483 --> 01:09:43,067
we're not in school!

726
01:09:43,152 --> 01:09:46,112
Don't worry. There's nothing
to worry about unless there's a ...

727
01:09:47,948 --> 01:09:49,574
A void collapse.

728
01:09:51,118 --> 01:09:53,411
I'll go get something
to pull you out.

729
01:09:53,495 --> 01:09:55,371
Ox, donâ€™t just sit there.

730
01:09:55,456 --> 01:09:58,166
For God's sake, man, go get help!

731
01:09:59,043 --> 01:10:01,127
- Help?
- Help!

732
01:10:01,212 --> 01:10:02,712
Help?

733
01:10:02,796 --> 01:10:04,214
Help! Go!

734
01:10:07,259 --> 01:10:09,594
Mutt can be a little impetuous.

735
01:10:09,678 --> 01:10:11,804
It's not the worst quality
in the world.

736
01:10:12,806 --> 01:10:15,725
Keep your arms above the surface.
When the kid comes back, grab on.

737
01:10:15,809 --> 01:10:18,895
- Indy, he ...
- He's a good kid, Marion.

738
01:10:18,979 --> 01:10:20,647
You should get off his back
about school.

739
01:10:20,731 --> 01:10:22,815
- Mutt, I mean ...
- Not everybody's cut out for it.

740
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:24,567
His name is Henry!

741
01:10:24,652 --> 01:10:26,194
Henry. Good name.

742
01:10:26,278 --> 01:10:27,779
He's your son.

743
01:10:29,823 --> 01:10:31,407
My son?

744
01:10:31,492 --> 01:10:33,368
Henry Jones the Third.

745
01:10:36,538 --> 01:10:40,416
Why the hell didn't you
make him finish school?

746
01:10:40,501 --> 01:10:43,169
- Mom, grab on! Grab it!
- Yeah.

747
01:10:43,254 --> 01:10:44,587
I got it.

748
01:10:45,798 --> 01:10:48,967
Come on, Mom!
Pull, pull, pull, pull!

749
01:10:49,051 --> 01:10:50,301
Pull!

750
01:10:53,264 --> 01:10:54,514
Grab on.

751
01:10:56,350 --> 01:10:59,102
- Grab it.
- Just grab it, Indy.

752
01:10:59,186 --> 01:11:00,728
It's a rat snake!

753
01:11:00,813 --> 01:11:02,772
- Rat snakes aren't that big.
- Well, this one is, all right?

754
01:11:02,856 --> 01:11:04,440
It's not even poisonous.
Now grab on!

755
01:11:04,525 --> 01:11:07,068
- Go get something else.
- Like what?

756
01:11:07,152 --> 01:11:08,903
Like a rope or something.

757
01:11:08,988 --> 01:11:12,198
There's no Sears and Roebuck here!
Grab the snake!

758
01:11:14,576 --> 01:11:17,787
- Maybe I can touch the bottom.
- There's no bottom. Now grab it.

759
01:11:17,871 --> 01:11:19,789
No, I think
I can feel it with my feet.

760
01:11:19,873 --> 01:11:22,500
- Grab the snake!
- Stop calling it that!

761
01:11:22,584 --> 01:11:24,294
It's a snake!
What do you want me to call it?

762
01:11:24,378 --> 01:11:26,254
- Say "rope."
- What?

763
01:11:26,338 --> 01:11:28,423
Say "grab the rope."

764
01:11:28,507 --> 01:11:31,050
- Grab the rope!
- Grab the rope!

765
01:11:31,135 --> 01:11:33,052
Hold tight. It's slimy.

766
01:11:33,929 --> 01:11:35,054
Pull!

767
01:11:41,478 --> 01:11:45,648
Get rid of that thing, will you, Son?

768
01:11:45,733 --> 01:11:47,358
Afraid of snakes.

769
01:11:48,944 --> 01:11:50,987
You are one crazy old man.

770
01:11:54,783 --> 01:11:58,286
Why do you have to do everything
the hard way, Jonesey?

771
01:12:02,082 --> 01:12:04,125
Good work, Ox. Thanks.

772
01:12:04,835 --> 01:12:05,918
Help.

773
01:12:39,828 --> 01:12:44,040
No. No, he was British.
My dad was an RAF pilot.

774
01:12:44,124 --> 01:12:46,417
He was a war hero,
not some schoolteacher!

775
01:12:46,502 --> 01:12:50,213
No, sweetheart.
Colin was your stepfather.

776
01:12:50,297 --> 01:12:52,090
We started dating
when you were three months old.

777
01:12:52,174 --> 01:12:53,549
He was a good man.

778
01:12:53,634 --> 01:12:57,804
Wait, wait, wait. Colin?
As in Colin Williams? You ...

779
01:12:59,014 --> 01:13:01,557
You married him? I introduced you!

780
01:13:01,642 --> 01:13:04,727
I think you gave up your vote
on who I married ...

781
01:13:04,812 --> 01:13:07,730
when you decided to break it off
a week before the wedding!

782
01:13:07,815 --> 01:13:10,149
I think we both knew, Marion,
it wasn't going to work.

783
01:13:10,234 --> 01:13:12,693
You didn't know that. Why didn't
you ever talk to me about it?

784
01:13:12,778 --> 01:13:14,654
Because we never had an argument
I won!

785
01:13:14,738 --> 01:13:16,489
It's not my fault
if you can't keep up!

786
01:13:16,573 --> 01:13:17,740
I didn't want to hurt you!

787
01:13:17,825 --> 01:13:20,451
For love of God, shut the hell up!

788
01:13:20,536 --> 01:13:24,539
Didn't you ever wonder years ago
why Ox stopped talking to you?

789
01:13:24,623 --> 01:13:26,332
He hated that you ran away.

790
01:13:26,417 --> 01:13:27,834
Would you two just stop?

791
01:13:27,918 --> 01:13:31,504
Yeah, Marion, let's not let
the kid see mom and dad fight.

792
01:13:31,588 --> 01:13:33,756
- You're not my dad, okay?
- You bet I am.

793
01:13:33,841 --> 01:13:35,174
And I got news for you.

794
01:13:35,259 --> 01:13:37,260
You're gonna go back
and finish school.

795
01:13:37,344 --> 01:13:38,511
Really? What happened to,

796
01:13:38,595 --> 01:13:40,096
"There's not a damn thing
wrong with it, kid,

797
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:41,472
"and don't let anybody else
tell you any different"?

798
01:13:41,557 --> 01:13:42,807
You don't remember saying that?

799
01:13:42,891 --> 01:13:44,600
That was before I was your father!

800
01:13:44,685 --> 01:13:46,144
- You're not my father!
- Oh, yes, he is your father.

801
01:13:46,228 --> 01:13:47,728
You should have
told me about the kid, Marion.

802
01:13:47,813 --> 01:13:49,063
I had a right to know.

803
01:13:49,148 --> 01:13:50,815
You vanished after that.

804
01:13:50,899 --> 01:13:53,443
- I wrote.
- A year later!

805
01:13:53,527 --> 01:13:57,321
By then,
Mutt was born and I was married!

806
01:13:57,406 --> 01:13:59,198
Why are you bothering
to tell me now?

807
01:13:59,283 --> 01:14:01,617
Because I thought we were gonna die!

808
01:14:01,702 --> 01:14:02,994
Not yet!

809
01:14:17,426 --> 01:14:18,676
Got it?

810
01:14:23,056 --> 01:14:24,348
Oh, shit.

811
01:14:36,737 --> 01:14:39,447
I'm sure I wasn't the only one
to go on with my life.

812
01:14:39,531 --> 01:14:42,492
There must've been plenty of
women for you over the years.

813
01:14:42,576 --> 01:14:46,787
Yeah. There were a few,
but they all had the same problem.

814
01:14:46,872 --> 01:14:48,581
Yeah? What's that?

815
01:14:50,834 --> 01:14:52,627
They weren't you, honey.

816
01:15:17,027 --> 01:15:19,111
We got to get Oxley back,
get our hands on that skull ...

817
01:15:19,196 --> 01:15:22,448
and get to Akator before they do.
Grab the wheel.

818
01:15:34,127 --> 01:15:36,254
What's he gonna do now?

819
01:15:36,338 --> 01:15:38,631
- I don't think he plans that far ahead.
- Yeah.

820
01:15:39,591 --> 01:15:42,718
- Scooch over, will you, Son?
- Don't call me "son." Don't.

821
01:15:43,053 --> 01:15:45,012
I think I'd cover my ears
if I were you.

822
01:15:55,816 --> 01:15:57,233
Duck! Duck!

823
01:16:00,821 --> 01:16:02,196
Move, move!

824
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:06,867
Pull up next to that duck.

825
01:16:15,794 --> 01:16:18,963
Henry Jones, Jr.

826
01:16:30,851 --> 01:16:32,351
Jones!

827
01:16:47,618 --> 01:16:49,368
Come on! Come on!

828
01:17:04,593 --> 01:17:05,926
Get down!

829
01:17:17,773 --> 01:17:20,733
Ox has got the skull.
Marion, take the wheel.

830
01:17:20,817 --> 01:17:22,151
That's not fair.
She drove the truck.

831
01:17:22,235 --> 01:17:25,279
Don't be a child.
Find something to fight with.

832
01:17:35,082 --> 01:17:36,332
Jonesey!

833
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:51,472
- Jonesey!
- Hi, Mac.

834
01:18:27,008 --> 01:18:30,136
- Indy. Indy! Indy!
- Shut up! Shut up!

835
01:18:30,220 --> 01:18:35,266
- You stupid son of a bitch! I'm CIA.
- CIA.

836
01:18:35,350 --> 01:18:38,978
I almost screamed it at you in the
tent. I said, "Just like Berlin."

837
01:18:39,062 --> 01:18:41,021
What were we in Berlin, mate?

838
01:18:41,106 --> 01:18:42,940
- Double agents!
- The skull!

839
01:18:43,024 --> 01:18:48,696
Throw me the skull!

840
01:19:10,677 --> 01:19:11,927
Riposte.

841
01:19:17,309 --> 01:19:19,435
Get on your front foot. Riposte.

842
01:19:19,519 --> 01:19:21,437
It's not a match, Mom.

843
01:19:47,380 --> 01:19:51,550
You fight like a young man,
eager to begin, quick to finish.

844
01:19:51,885 --> 01:19:53,511
Mutt, disengage!

845
01:20:32,926 --> 01:20:35,427
Hey! Hey, I got the skull!

846
01:20:35,512 --> 01:20:37,596
- Throw the bag! Throw it!
- Throw the bag!

847
01:20:38,306 --> 01:20:39,765
- Gun!
- Gun!

848
01:21:26,313 --> 01:21:29,690
What are you looking at, Daddy-o?
She's getting away!

849
01:22:28,041 --> 01:22:30,125
This is very dangerous.

850
01:22:58,071 --> 01:23:00,239
Do svidanya, Dr. Jones.

851
01:23:28,268 --> 01:23:29,768
Jones!

852
01:23:32,355 --> 01:23:35,607
Whoa.

853
01:23:37,068 --> 01:23:38,152
Whoa!

854
01:23:43,283 --> 01:23:44,283
Turn!

855
01:24:16,441 --> 01:24:17,775
- Siafu.
- What?

856
01:24:17,859 --> 01:24:19,610
Big damn ants! Go!

857
01:24:33,208 --> 01:24:35,000
Run to the river!

858
01:24:55,188 --> 01:24:56,897
Get to the river!

859
01:25:05,949 --> 01:25:08,158
Jump in! Come on! Come on!

860
01:25:13,832 --> 01:25:15,624
Mom, there's a cliff!

861
01:28:00,748 --> 01:28:03,292
- Jonesey, come on!
- Get in, Jones!

862
01:28:19,851 --> 01:28:22,060
- Mom, stop.
- Mom, slow down.

863
01:28:26,065 --> 01:28:27,232
- Honey, stop.
- Slow down, Mom.

864
01:28:27,317 --> 01:28:28,984
- You're gonna go off the cliff.
- That's the idea.

865
01:28:29,068 --> 01:28:31,653
- Bad idea. Give me the wheel.
- Trust me!

866
01:28:31,738 --> 01:28:33,113
Slow down!

867
01:29:00,767 --> 01:29:04,436
- Don't ever do that again.
- Yes, dear.

868
01:29:15,531 --> 01:29:17,783
Three times it drops.

869
01:29:21,454 --> 01:29:24,039
Reverse. Put it in reverse!
Full reverse!

870
01:29:24,123 --> 01:29:25,916
- I'm trying! I'm trying!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, Mom!

871
01:29:47,188 --> 01:29:48,730
The way down.

872
01:29:50,650 --> 01:29:53,777
He means by land.
He came by land.

873
01:29:56,322 --> 01:29:58,573
- Three times it drops?
- Three times it drops.

874
01:29:58,658 --> 01:30:00,033
What is he talking about?

875
01:30:00,118 --> 01:30:01,743
He means one!

876
01:30:04,539 --> 01:30:05,831
Two!

877
01:30:24,016 --> 01:30:25,350
Three.

878
01:30:59,218 --> 01:31:02,888
You okay? Babe? Let go.

879
01:31:02,972 --> 01:31:05,932
"Through eyes that last I saw in tears."

880
01:31:08,019 --> 01:31:10,228
"The golden vision reappears!"

881
01:31:13,900 --> 01:31:15,901
Gold. I'm in.

882
01:31:15,985 --> 01:31:20,614
Through eyes ... Through eyes in tears.
We got to go through that waterfall!

883
01:31:22,658 --> 01:31:26,495
The skull has to be returned.
I'll do it. Nobody else has to come.

884
01:31:26,579 --> 01:31:28,747
Who cares?

885
01:31:28,831 --> 01:31:31,708
It's brought us nothing but trouble.

886
01:31:31,792 --> 01:31:34,252
Look what it did to him.

887
01:31:34,337 --> 01:31:37,506
- I have to return it.
- Why you?

888
01:31:37,590 --> 01:31:39,633
Because it told me to.

889
01:31:52,438 --> 01:31:56,858
- Ochre, iron oxide, charcoal.
- Oxy, stay with us.

890
01:31:56,943 --> 01:31:58,568
How old is this?

891
01:31:58,653 --> 01:32:01,821
Four or five thousand years.
Old as the pyramids.

892
01:32:02,532 --> 01:32:05,784
Look, sun worshippers,
like the Egyptians.

893
01:32:08,621 --> 01:32:11,831
This is fresh.
These were just used.

894
01:32:25,805 --> 01:32:27,514
More worshippers.

895
01:32:27,598 --> 01:32:30,809
Yeah, but that's not
the sun they're worshipping.

896
01:32:36,983 --> 01:32:38,358
Someone came ...

897
01:32:41,612 --> 01:32:44,781
and taught the Ugha farming.

898
01:32:48,869 --> 01:32:50,370
Irrigation.

899
01:33:00,715 --> 01:33:02,674
Ox, what is it?

900
01:33:19,442 --> 01:33:21,568
I think I understand, Ox.

901
01:33:24,113 --> 01:33:25,572
Someone came?

902
01:33:49,597 --> 01:33:51,097
Are they the same?

903
01:33:51,182 --> 01:33:53,058
There were more. Look.

904
01:33:56,937 --> 01:33:58,730
Thirteen in a circle.

905
01:34:06,072 --> 01:34:07,781
Show us the way, Ox.

906
01:34:56,455 --> 01:35:00,417
- Let's go. Go, go, go! Run! Run, go!
- Go!

907
01:35:30,990 --> 01:35:32,741
Indy!

908
01:35:32,825 --> 01:35:35,410
Jonesey!

909
01:35:35,494 --> 01:35:36,953
Oxley!

910
01:35:37,955 --> 01:35:40,999
You were here before.
How did you get past them?

911
01:35:52,636 --> 01:35:55,764
Come on, Mac. Come on!
Come on, Mac.

912
01:35:58,517 --> 01:35:59,601
Come on, come on, come on.

913
01:35:59,685 --> 01:36:01,102
"To lay their just hands
on that Golden Key ...

914
01:36:01,187 --> 01:36:02,812
"that ope's the Palace of Eternity."
- Come on, Ox.

915
01:36:02,897 --> 01:36:04,022
You did good, Ox. You did good.

916
01:36:28,380 --> 01:36:31,508
City of gold.
So where's all the gold?

917
01:36:32,843 --> 01:36:34,719
Look at the state of this place.

918
01:36:34,804 --> 01:36:37,597
What a stupid legend.
What a waste of my time.

919
01:36:37,681 --> 01:36:42,477
Ox was here before, but he
couldn't get into the temple,

920
01:36:42,561 --> 01:36:46,397
so he took the skull back
to the cemetery, where he found it.

921
01:36:47,191 --> 01:36:50,610
"To lay their just hands
on that Golden Key ...

922
01:36:50,694 --> 01:36:52,987
"that ope's the Palace of Eternity."

923
01:36:53,072 --> 01:36:55,573
Key that ope's the palace.

924
01:36:56,909 --> 01:36:59,577
The obelisk.
The obelisk is the key?

925
01:37:07,086 --> 01:37:09,420
What are you looking for, Ox?

926
01:37:11,632 --> 01:37:13,383
What are you doing?

927
01:37:18,264 --> 01:37:21,933
You figured this out in your cell,
didn't you, Professor?

928
01:37:22,893 --> 01:37:24,686
Excuse me, Professor.

929
01:37:39,743 --> 01:37:41,077
Well done.

930
01:37:42,288 --> 01:37:43,997
Go get your own.

931
01:38:43,182 --> 01:38:44,557
Listen.

932
01:38:46,060 --> 01:38:47,518
Hear that?

933
01:38:49,980 --> 01:38:52,148
Get up! Move! Ox, move!

934
01:38:56,028 --> 01:39:01,115
Faster! Faster!

935
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:02,784
Faster!

936
01:39:02,868 --> 01:39:05,161
This is not good. Move, Ox! Move!

937
01:39:05,788 --> 01:39:07,622
Quick! Quick! Quick!

938
01:39:10,042 --> 01:39:12,669
I don't like this!
I don't like it!

939
01:39:12,753 --> 01:39:14,754
- Mom, come on!
- Jonesey!

940
01:39:32,064 --> 01:39:34,399
He dropped it.
He dropped the skull!

941
01:39:34,483 --> 01:39:35,733
Okay?

942
01:39:46,078 --> 01:39:47,412
Hold this.

943
01:39:50,874 --> 01:39:52,542
Ox, you okay?

944
01:39:56,338 --> 01:39:57,547
Lovely.

945
01:39:58,716 --> 01:40:00,591
All right, let's go.

946
01:40:07,599 --> 01:40:08,891
This way?

947
01:41:16,001 --> 01:41:18,002
Now that's more like it.

948
01:41:24,051 --> 01:41:27,970
There are artifacts
from every era of early history.

949
01:41:28,055 --> 01:41:30,223
Macedonian.

950
01:41:30,349 --> 01:41:32,934
- Sumerian.
- This place is the mother lode.

951
01:41:33,018 --> 01:41:34,977
Etruscan. Babylonian.

952
01:41:35,062 --> 01:41:39,190
There isn't a museum in the world that
wouldn't sell its soul for this lot.

953
01:41:39,274 --> 01:41:40,358
Early Egyptian.

954
01:41:40,442 --> 01:41:43,402
Dozens of museums.
Hundreds of them, Jonesey!

955
01:41:44,279 --> 01:41:45,655
Collectors.

956
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:50,159
They were archeologists.

957
01:42:27,781 --> 01:42:29,448
How do we open it?

958
01:42:34,913 --> 01:42:38,249
I'll give it back, Ox. I promise.

959
01:43:57,496 --> 01:44:00,122
No more forever waiting.

960
01:44:01,500 --> 01:44:03,167
Soon now.

961
01:44:12,928 --> 01:44:14,845
Sorry, Jonesey.

962
01:44:14,930 --> 01:44:17,598
So what are you, a triple agent?

963
01:44:17,683 --> 01:44:21,018
Nah, I just lied
about being a double.

964
01:44:26,358 --> 01:44:28,150
Look at them!

965
01:44:30,195 --> 01:44:34,865
Still waiting for the return
of the one who was lost.

966
01:44:39,204 --> 01:44:41,122
They are a hive mind.

967
01:44:43,083 --> 01:44:47,753
One being physically separate,
but with a collective consciousness.

968
01:44:49,548 --> 01:44:52,800
More powerful together
than they can ever be apart.

969
01:45:01,810 --> 01:45:04,395
Imagine what they could tell us.

970
01:45:04,521 --> 01:45:06,230
I can't imagine.

971
01:45:06,315 --> 01:45:07,815
Neither could the humans
that built this temple,

972
01:45:07,899 --> 01:45:08,983
and neither can you.

973
01:45:09,067 --> 01:45:12,570
Belief, Dr. Jones,
is a gift you have yet to receive.

974
01:45:14,114 --> 01:45:15,656
My sympathies.

975
01:45:15,741 --> 01:45:19,410
Oh, I believe, sister.
That's why I'm down here.

976
01:45:54,196 --> 01:45:57,448
- Mayan. He's speaking Mayan.
- What does he say?

977
01:45:57,532 --> 01:46:00,201
He says he's grateful
and he wants ...

978
01:46:02,329 --> 01:46:03,496
It.

979
01:46:06,792 --> 01:46:10,628
It wants to give us a gift.

980
01:46:13,465 --> 01:46:15,299
A big gift.

981
01:46:16,635 --> 01:46:18,761
Tell me everything you know.

982
01:46:22,808 --> 01:46:25,643
I want to know everything.
I want to know.

983
01:46:33,819 --> 01:46:36,320
I've got a bad feeling about this.

984
01:46:40,992 --> 01:46:42,326
Indy?

985
01:46:43,161 --> 01:46:44,495
The eyes.

986
01:47:49,102 --> 01:47:50,853
What are they? Spacemen?

987
01:47:51,229 --> 01:47:54,648
Interdimensional beings,
in point of fact.

988
01:47:54,733 --> 01:47:56,525
Welcome back, Ox.

989
01:48:07,954 --> 01:48:09,622
What the hell is that?

990
01:48:09,706 --> 01:48:13,042
A portal!
A pathway to another dimension!

991
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:16,587
I don't think we want
to go that way.

992
01:48:32,103 --> 01:48:36,273
I want to know.

993
01:48:37,609 --> 01:48:41,278
Tell me. I'm ready.
I want to know.

994
01:48:47,536 --> 01:48:50,871
Mac! Mac! Come on!

995
01:48:52,707 --> 01:48:53,791
Mac!

996
01:48:56,294 --> 01:48:57,962
Mac, damn it, now!

997
01:49:10,850 --> 01:49:12,309
I can see.

998
01:49:14,187 --> 01:49:15,521
I can see!

999
01:49:18,608 --> 01:49:19,817
Grab it!

1000
01:49:24,698 --> 01:49:27,491
Use your legs, Mac.
I can't do it alone.

1001
01:49:29,411 --> 01:49:30,828
Jonesey!

1002
01:49:32,289 --> 01:49:34,331
I'm going to be all right.

1003
01:49:42,966 --> 01:49:44,174
No more!

1004
01:49:47,679 --> 01:49:49,888
Cover it. Cover it.

1005
01:50:03,320 --> 01:50:04,403
Go!

1006
01:50:04,487 --> 01:50:08,490
Enough!

1007
01:50:21,254 --> 01:50:22,755
Go! Go!

1008
01:52:43,104 --> 01:52:45,522
Like a broom to their footprints.

1009
01:52:48,193 --> 01:52:51,570
Where did they go? Space?

1010
01:52:52,405 --> 01:52:57,576
Not into space.
Into the space between spaces.

1011
01:53:06,377 --> 01:53:08,170
I don't understand.

1012
01:53:09,756 --> 01:53:12,674
Why this legend of a city of gold?

1013
01:53:12,759 --> 01:53:15,928
The Ugha word for gold
translates as "treasure."

1014
01:53:16,930 --> 01:53:20,098
But their treasure wasn't gold.
It was knowledge.

1015
01:53:20,934 --> 01:53:23,143
Knowledge was their treasure.

1016
01:53:38,868 --> 01:53:41,161
What? We're just going to sit here?

1017
01:53:41,246 --> 01:53:42,913
Night falls quick in the jungle, kid.

1018
01:53:42,997 --> 01:53:44,915
You don't want to
climb down the mountain in the dark.

1019
01:53:44,999 --> 01:53:46,250
No?

1020
01:53:47,502 --> 01:53:51,004
I can. Who's coming with me?
Come on.

1021
01:53:51,089 --> 01:53:53,590
Why don't you stick around, Junior?

1022
01:53:56,094 --> 01:53:59,054
I don't know. Why didn't you, Dad?

1023
01:54:01,140 --> 01:54:02,599
Dad!

1024
01:54:06,229 --> 01:54:07,563
Dad?

1025
01:54:12,527 --> 01:54:15,112
Somewhere your grandpa is laughing.

1026
01:54:31,796 --> 01:54:35,507
Marvelous! Perfect! Make the
letters bigger, much bigger.

1027
01:54:48,229 --> 01:54:51,982
Henry Jones, Jr.,
and Marion Ravenwood,

1028
01:54:52,066 --> 01:54:57,070
insomuch in that you two have agreed
to live together in holy matrimony,

1029
01:54:57,155 --> 01:55:00,365
have promised your love for
each other by these vows ...

1030
01:55:00,450 --> 01:55:03,785
the joining of your hands
and the giving of these rings,

1031
01:55:03,870 --> 01:55:06,830
I now declare you
to be husband and wife.

1032
01:55:07,665 --> 01:55:12,377
Whom God hath put together,
let no one tear asunder.

1033
01:55:12,462 --> 01:55:15,380
"How much of human life
is lost in waiting!"

1034
01:55:16,549 --> 01:55:18,175
Congratulations.

1035
01:55:18,885 --> 01:55:21,011
You may kiss your bride.

1036
01:55:41,574 --> 01:55:43,283
Well done, Henry!

1037
01:55:43,368 --> 01:55:45,369
- Thanks, Ox.
- Thanks, Ox.
