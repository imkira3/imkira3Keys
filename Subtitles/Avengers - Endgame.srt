1
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:09,837
Okay, hold on,
don't shoot.

2
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:12,669
- You see where you're going?
- Mm-hmm.

3
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:13,846
Okay.

4
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,926
Now, let's worry
about how you get there.

5
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,174
Gotta move your foot here.

6
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,096
Point your toe this way.

7
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:22,015
Your hips here.

8
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:23,563
Okay?

9
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:25,815
- Can you see?
- Yeah.

10
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:26,982
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.

11
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:28,401
How about now?
Can you see now?

12
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:29,819
- No.
- How about now?

13
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,071
All right.

14
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:35,654
Ready? Three fingers.

15
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:37,527
Nice!

16
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,704
Nice throw, kiddo.

17
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:41,955
Here you go.

18
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:44,451
Hey, you guys want mayo?
Or mustard?

19
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:46,002
Or both?

20
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,253
Who puts mayo on a hot dog?

21
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:49,459
Probably your brothers.

22
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,633
Uh, two mustard, please!
Thanks, Mama.

23
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:52,718
Got it!

24
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,714
Nate, mayo or mustard?

25
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,637
How about ketchup?

26
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,014
Or ketchup.
I got ketchup, too.

27
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,390
Mind your elbow.

28
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,436
Good job, hawk-eye.

29
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:07,314
Go get your arrow.

30
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,444
Hey, guys!

31
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,820
Enough practice.
Soup's on!

32
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,026
All right.

33
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,485
We're coming. We're hungry.

34
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,113
Lila, let's go.

35
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,405
Lila?

36
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,335
Honey?

37
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:31,296
Hey, babe?

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

39
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,175
Babe?

40
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,515
Babe?

41
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,347
Boys!

42
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,110
Boys!

43
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:54,563
Laura!

44
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,615
You don't need to do that.

45
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,823
Because, uh, you're just
holding the position.

46
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,113
Oh, yeah.

47
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:47,198
That was close.

48
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,951
That's a goal.
We are now one apiece.

49
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,494
I would like to try again.

50
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:56,207
We're tied up.
Feel the tension?

51
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:57,921
It's fun.

52
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,087
That was terrible.
Now you have a chance to win.

53
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:02,348
And you've won.

54
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,594
Congratulations.

55
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:05,884
Fair game.

56
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,598
Good sport.

57
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,972
You have fun?

58
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,730
It was fun.

59
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,878
This thing on?

60
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,046
Hey, Miss Potts. Pep.

61
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:47,099
If you find this recording...

62
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:50,012
don't post it on social media.

63
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:51,812
It's gonna be
a real tearjerker.

64
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,895
I don't know if
you're ever gonna see these.

65
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,105
I don't even know
if you're still...

66
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,520
Oh, God, I hope so.

67
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,607
<i>Today's day 21.</i>

68
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,026
<i>No, uh, 22.</i>

69
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:08,242
<i>You know, if it wasn't
for the existential terror...</i>

70
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,577
<i>of staring into
the literal void of space,</i>

71
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,875
<i>I'd say I'm feeling
a little better today.</i>

72
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,455
<i>Infection's run its course,</i>

73
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,082
<i>thanks to
the Blue Meanie back there.</i>

74
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,255
<i>Oh, you'd love her.</i>

75
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,836
<i>Very practical.</i>

76
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:22,385
<i>Only a tiny bit sadistic.</i>

77
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,554
<i>So, the fuel cells
were cracked during battle...</i>

78
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,806
<i>and we figured out a way
to reverse the ion charge...</i>

79
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,688
<i>and bought ourselves
about 48 hours of flight time.</i>

80
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,810
<i>Uh, but it's now dead
in the water.</i>

81
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:43,481
<i>Thousand light years
from the nearest 7-Eleven.</i>

82
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,360
<i>Oxygen will run out
tomorrow morning...</i>

83
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,534
<i>and that'll be it.</i>

84
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,919
<i>Pep, I know I said
no more surprises...</i>

85
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,795
<i>but I gotta say
I was really hoping</i>

86
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,669
<i>to pull off one last one.</i>

87
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,799
<i>But it looks like...</i>

88
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,756
<i>Well, you know
what it looks like.</i>

89
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,013
Don't feel bad about this.

90
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:10,971
I mean, actually, if you
grovel for a couple weeks...

91
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,846
and then move on
with enormous guilt...

92
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,978
I should probably lie down
for a minute.

93
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:24,029
Go rest my eyes.

94
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,571
Please know...

95
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:33,372
when I drift off, it'll be
like every night lately.

96
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,542
I'm fine. Totally fine.

97
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,498
I dream about you.

98
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,672
Because it's always you.

99
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:05,419
Couldn't stop him.

100
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:06,587
Neither could I.

101
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:07,916
Hang on.

102
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,923
I lost the kid.

103
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,053
Tony, we lost.

104
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,349
Is, uh...?

105
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,967
- Oh, good.
- Oh, my God!

106
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,641
Oh, my God!

107
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,151
It's okay.

108
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,868
It's been 23 days
since Thanos came to Earth.

109
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,660
World governments
are in pieces.

110
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,621
The parts
that are still working...

111
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:50,621
...are trying to take a census
and it looks like he did...

112
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,104
He did exactly what he said
he was gonna do.

113
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,217
Thanos wiped out...

114
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,807
...50% of
all living creatures.

115
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,059
Where is he now? Where?

116
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:09,940
We don't know.

117
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,194
He just opened a portal
and walked through.

118
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:16,860
What's wrong with him?

119
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,908
Oh, he's pissed.

120
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,410
He thinks he failed.

121
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:23,953
Which, of course, he did...

122
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,157
but there's a lot of that
going around, ain't there?

123
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,745
Honestly,
until this exact second

124
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:29,105
I thought you were
a Build-A-Bear.

125
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,540
Maybe I am.

126
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,149
We've been hunting Thanos
for three weeks now.

127
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,165
Deep space scans...

128
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,382
and satellites,
and we got nothing.

129
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,179
Tony, you fought him.

130
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:40,264
Who told you that?

131
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:41,968
I didn't fight him.

132
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,804
No, he wiped my face
with a planet...

133
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,121
while the Bleecker Street
magician

134
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,386
gave away the store.

135
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,479
That's what happened.

136
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:48,958
There was no fight,
'cause he's not beatable.

137
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,690
Did he give you any clues,
any coordinates, anything?

138
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,187
Uh...

139
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,187
I saw this coming
a few years back.

140
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,004
I had a vision.
I didn't wanna believe it.

141
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,948
Thought I was dreaming.

142
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,262
Tony, I'm gonna need you
to focus.

143
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,027
And I needed you.

144
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,240
As in, past tense.

145
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,657
That trumps what you need.
It's too late, buddy.

146
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:08,950
Sorry.

147
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,628
You know what I need?
I need a shave.

148
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,711
And I believe I remember
telling all youse...

149
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,916
Tony, Tony!

150
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,378
...alive and otherwise,
that what we needed

151
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,337
was a suit of armor
around the world.

152
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:23,432
Remember that?

153
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,179
Whether it impacted
our precious freedoms or not.

154
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,476
That's what we needed.

155
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:28,873
Well, that didn't work out,
did it?

156
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:30,308
I said we'd lose.

157
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,643
You said,
"We'll do that together, too."

158
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,274
And guess what, Cap?

159
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:35,730
We lost.

160
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,196
And you weren't there.

161
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:39,942
But that's what we do, right?

162
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,950
Our best work after the fact?
We're the "Avengers."

163
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,073
We're the "Avengers,"
not the "Pre-vengers."

164
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:46,163
- Okay.
- Right?

165
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,558
You made your point.
Just sit down, okay?

166
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:48,809
Okay. No, no, here's my point.
You know what?

167
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,352
- She's great by the way.
- Tony, you're sick. Sit down.

168
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,083
We need you.
You're new blood.

169
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,083
Bunch of tired old mules.
I got nothing for you, Cap.

170
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:56,459
I got no coordinates...

171
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:59,376
no clues, no strategies,
no options.

172
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,259
Zero. Zip. Nada.

173
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,170
No trust, liar.

174
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:08,968
Here, take this.

175
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,262
You find him,
you put that on...

176
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,267
you hide.

177
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,274
- Tony!
- I'm fine.

178
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,151
Let me...

179
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:25,981
Bruce gave him
a sedative.

180
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,120
He's gonna probably be out
for the rest of the day.

181
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,372
You guys
take care of him...

182
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,621
and I'll bring him a Xorrian
elixir when I come back.

183
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:33,669
Where are you going?

184
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,498
To kill Thanos.

185
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:39,756
Hey.

186
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,959
You know, we usually work
as a team here...

187
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,948
and, uh, between you and I,
morale's a little fragile.

188
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:46,385
We realize up there
is more your territory,

189
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,555
but this is our fight, too.

190
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:48,886
You even know where he is?

191
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,221
I know people who might.

192
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:51,727
Don't bother.

193
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,430
I can tell you
where Thanos is.

194
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,944
Thanos spent a long time
trying to perfect me.

195
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:04,611
And when he worked, he talked
about his Great Plan.

196
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,868
Even disassembled,
I wanted to please him.

197
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,448
I'd ask...

198
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,661
where would we go
once his plan was complete?

199
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,159
And his answer
was always the same.

200
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,382
"To the Garden."

201
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,758
That's cute.
Thanos has a retirement plan.

202
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,464
So, where is he?

203
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,880
When Thanos snapped
his fingers...

204
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,049
Earth became ground zero
for a power surge

205
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,930
of ridiculously
cosmic proportions.

206
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,311
No one's ever seen
anything like it.

207
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,812
Until two days ago...

208
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,232
on this planet.

209
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,435
Thanos is there.

210
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,863
He used the stones again.

211
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:46,857
Hey, hey, hey.

212
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,908
We'd be going in shorthanded,
you know?

213
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,597
Look, he's still
got the stones, so...

214
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,157
So, let's get 'em.

215
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,789
Use them
to bring everyone back.

216
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,036
Just like that?

217
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:56,708
Yeah. Just like that.

218
00:13:56,878 --> 00:14:00,042
Even if there's a small chance
that we can undo this...

219
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,922
I mean, we owe it to everyone
who's not in this room to try.

220
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,708
If we do this, how do we know

221
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,044
it's gonna end any differently
than it did before?

222
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,837
Because before
you didn't have me.

223
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:10,885
Hey, new girl?

224
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,767
Everybody in this room
is about that superhero life.

225
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,622
And if you don't mind
my asking,

226
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:16,832
where the hell have you been
all this time?

227
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,143
There are a lot of
other planets in the universe.

228
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:22,185
And unfortunately,
they didn't have you guys.

229
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,922
I like this one.

230
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,929
Let's go get
this son of a bitch.

231
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:13,703
Okay.

232
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:16,489
Who here hasn't been to space?

233
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,082
Why?

234
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,830
You better not throw up
on my ship.

235
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,289
Approaching jump in three...

236
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,545
two, one.

237
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,811
<i>I'll head down for recon.</i>

238
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,539
This is gonna work, Steve.

239
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,499
I know it will.

240
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,626
'Cause I don't know what
I'm gonna do if it doesn't.

241
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:11,710
<i>No satellites.
No ships. No armies.</i>

242
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,379
<i>No ground defenses
of any kind.</i>

243
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,137
<i>It's just him.</i>

244
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,509
And that's enough.

245
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:49,775
Oh, no.

246
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:00,994
Where are they?

247
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,988
Answer the question.

248
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,872
The universe
required correction.

249
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:11,834
After that, the stones
served no purpose...

250
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,624
beyond temptation.

251
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,758
You murdered trillions!

252
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:19,008
You should be grateful.

253
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,430
Where are the stones?

254
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:25,970
Gone.

255
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:27,228
Reduced to atoms.

256
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,389
You used them two days ago!

257
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:32,776
I used the stones
to destroy the stones.

258
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,145
It nearly killed me.

259
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:38,315
But the work is done.

260
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:41,406
It always will be.

261
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:46,365
I am inevitable.

262
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,036
We have to tear this place
apart. He has to be lying!

263
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,493
My father
is many things.

264
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,382
A liar is not one of them.

265
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:58,589
Ah.

266
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,720
Thank you, daughter.

267
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,513
Perhaps I treated you
too harshly.

268
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,026
What?

269
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,435
What did you do?

270
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,776
I went for the head.

271
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,849
<i>So...</i>

272
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,648
...I, uh, went on a date
the other day.

273
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,480
It's the first time
in five years.

274
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,986
You know?
I'm sitting there at dinner.

275
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,190
I didn't even know
what to talk about.

276
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:45,742
What did you talk about?

277
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,579
Eh, same old crap. You know,
how things have changed.

278
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,823
My job, his job.

279
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:54,701
How much we miss the Mets.

280
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:58,667
And then things got quiet...

281
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:04,378
then he cried as they were
serving the salads.

282
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:06,046
What about you?

283
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:10,384
I cried just before dessert.

284
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:16,265
But I'm seeing him
again tomorrow, so...

285
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,183
That's great.

286
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,080
You did the hardest part.
You took the jump.

287
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,229
You didn't know where you
were gonna come down.

288
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:24,731
And that's it.
That's those little

289
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,158
brave baby steps
we gotta take...

290
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:31,038
to try and become whole again,
try and find purpose.

291
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,411
I went in the ice in '45,

292
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:36,869
right after I met
the love of my life.

293
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:39,496
Woke up 70 years later.

294
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,672
You gotta move on.

295
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,005
Gotta move on.

296
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,267
The world is in our hands.

297
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,523
It's left to us, guys.

298
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,900
And we gotta do
something with it.

299
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,023
Otherwise...

300
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,656
Thanos should've killed
all of us.

301
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:09,928
What the hell?

302
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,558
Hope?

303
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:57,769
Kid!

304
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:58,973
Hey, kid!

305
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:05,525
What the hell happened here?

306
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,971
Oh, my God!

307
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,271
Oh, please!

308
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,976
Please, please!

309
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,142
No, no, no. No.

310
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:49,978
No.

311
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,324
Excuse me. Sorry.

312
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,778
Oh, Cassie, no.

313
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:56,409
No, no, no.

314
00:24:57,788 --> 00:24:59,495
No, no.

315
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:03,329
Please, please, please.
No, Cassie.

316
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:11,712
What?

317
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,122
Cassie?

318
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:45,659
Dad?

319
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:14,108
You're so big!

320
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,772
<i>Yeah. We boarded</i>

321
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:31,914
<i>that highly-suspect warship
Danvers pinged.</i>

322
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:33,798
<i>It was an infectious
garbage scow.</i>

323
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,424
<i>So, thanks for the hot tip.</i>

324
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:36,926
<i>Well, you were closer.</i>

325
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:38,531
<i>Yeah. And now
we smell like garbage.</i>

326
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:39,915
You get a reading
on those tremors?

327
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:42,640
<i>'Twas a mild subduction
under the African plate.</i>

328
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,847
Do we have a visual?
How are we handling it?

329
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,181
<i>Nat.</i>

330
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:48,604
<i>It's an earthquake
under the ocean.</i>

331
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:51,608
<i>We handle it
by not handling it.</i>

332
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:54,478
Carol, are we seeing you here
next month?

333
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,028
<i>Not likely.</i>

334
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:57,651
<i>What? You gonna get
another haircut?</i>

335
00:26:57,825 --> 00:26:59,157
<i>Listen, fur face.</i>

336
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,113
<i>I'm covering
a lot of territory.</i>

337
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,073
<i>The things
that are happening on Earth</i>

338
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,404
<i>are happening everywhere.</i>

339
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,580
<i>On thousands of planets.</i>

340
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,311
<i>All right, all right.
That's a good point.</i>

341
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,416
<i>That's a good point.</i>

342
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,669
<i>So, you might not see me
for a long time.</i>

343
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:14,168
All right. Uh, well...

344
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,167
This channel's always active.

345
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,427
So, if anything
goes sideways...

346
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:22,009
anyone's making trouble
where they shouldn't...

347
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,343
comes through me.

348
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,049
<i>Okay.</i>

349
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:26,601
All right.

350
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,435
<i>Good luck.</i>

351
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,030
Where are you?

352
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,198
<i>Mexico.</i>

353
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,983
<i>The Federales found a room
full of bodies.</i>

354
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,777
<i>Looks like
a bunch of cartel guys...</i>

355
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:45,911
<i>never even had a chance
to get their guns off.</i>

356
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,788
It's probably a rival gang.

357
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:49,165
<i>Except it isn't.</i>

358
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:51,501
<i>It's definitely Barton.</i>

359
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,669
<i>What he's done here...</i>

360
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:57,003
<i>what he's been doing
for the last few years...</i>

361
00:27:57,843 --> 00:27:59,630
<i>I mean,
the scene that he left...</i>

362
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:01,637
<i>I gotta tell you,</i>

363
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:04,180
<i>there's a part of me that
doesn't even wanna find him.</i>

364
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:12,013
Will you find out
where he's going next?

365
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,060
<i>Nat?</i>

366
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:20,571
Please?

367
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:23,487
<i>Okay.</i>

368
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:34,174
You know, I'd offer
to cook you dinner...

369
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:36,045
but you seem
pretty miserable already.

370
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,575
You here
to do your laundry?

371
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,302
And to see a friend.

372
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,052
Clearly, your friend is fine.

373
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,097
You know,
I saw a pod of whales

374
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:52,457
when I was coming over
the bridge.

375
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,313
- In the Hudson?
- There's fewer ships...

376
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:55,724
cleaner water.

377
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,767
You know,
if you're about to tell me

378
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,818
to look on the bright side...

379
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,237
Um...

380
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:03,565
I'm about to hit you
in the head

381
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:05,776
with a peanut butter sandwich.

382
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:06,869
Hmm.

383
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:08,907
Sorry.

384
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,242
Force of habit.

385
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:25,924
You know,
I keep telling everybody

386
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,630
they should move on...

387
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:29,466
and grow.

388
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:31,972
Some do.

389
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,931
But not us.

390
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:39,730
If I move on, who does this?

391
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:42,229
Maybe it doesn't need
to be done.

392
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,693
I used to have nothing.

393
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,783
And then I got this.

394
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,791
This job.

395
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,912
This family.

396
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,587
And I was better
because of it.

397
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:17,393
And even though
they're gone...

398
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,774
I'm still trying to be better.

399
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,238
I think we both need
to get a life.

400
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,074
You first.

401
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,786
<i>Oh, hi, hi!</i>

402
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,087
<i>Uh, is anyone home?</i>

403
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,963
<i>This is, uh, Scott Lang.</i>

404
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:45,967
<i>We met a few years ago
at the airport...</i>

405
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:47,798
<i>in Germany?</i>

406
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,258
<i>I was the guy that got
really big. I had a mask on.</i>

407
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:52,076
<i>- You wouldn't recognize me.</i>
- Is this an old message?

408
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,059
<i>Ant-Man?
I know you know that.</i>

409
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,309
It's the front gate.

410
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:57,874
<i>I really need
to talk to you guys.</i>

411
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,148
Scott.

412
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,114
Are you okay?

413
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,282
Yeah.

414
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:12,444
Have either of you guys
ever studied quantum physics?

415
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,362
Only to make conversation.

416
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:17,073
All right, so...

417
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:20,167
five years ago,
right before...

418
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:21,870
Thanos...

419
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:24,338
I was in a place
called the quantum realm.

420
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:27,000
The quantum realm is like
its own microscopic universe.

421
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,347
To get in there, you have
to be incredibly small.

422
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:31,007
Hope. She's my, um...

423
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,807
She was my...

424
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,760
She was supposed to
pull me out.

425
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,478
And then Thanos happened...

426
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:41,310
and I got stuck in there.

427
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:43,878
I'm sorry, that must have been
a very long five years.

428
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,234
Yeah, but that's just it.

429
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:46,565
It wasn't.

430
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:47,945
For me, it was five hours.

431
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:49,475
See, the rules of
the quantum realm

432
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:50,676
aren't like they are up here.

433
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,236
Everything is unpredictable.

434
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:53,618
Is that anybody's sandwich?

435
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:55,028
I'm starving.

436
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:56,488
Scott.

437
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:57,951
What are you talking about?

438
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:00,200
So...

439
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,751
what I'm saying is...

440
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,043
time works differently
in the quantum realm.

441
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:08,082
The only problem is right now

442
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,587
we don't have a way
to navigate it.

443
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:10,678
But what if we did?

444
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,637
I can't stop thinking
about it.

445
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,714
What if we could
somehow control the chaos...

446
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:16,015
and we could navigate it?

447
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:17,683
What if there was a way...

448
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,385
that we could enter
the quantum realm

449
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,639
at a certain point in time...

450
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,187
but then exit
the quantum realm

451
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:23,435
at another point in time?

452
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:24,940
Like...

453
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:27,777
- Like before Thanos.
- Wait.

454
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,528
Are you talking
about a time machine?

455
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:32,441
No. No, of course not.
No, not a time machine.

456
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:33,653
This is more like a...

457
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:37,612
Yeah. Like a time machine.

458
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,576
I know, it's crazy.
It's crazy.

459
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,783
But I can't stop
thinking about it.

460
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:43,118
There's gotta be...

461
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:45,245
some way...

462
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,125
- It's crazy.
- Scott.

463
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:48,585
I get emails from a raccoon...

464
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,750
so nothing
sounds crazy anymore.

465
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:53,594
So, who do we talk to
about this?

466
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:12,946
Chow time!

467
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,446
Maguna.

468
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:22,189
Morgan H. Stark,
you want some lunch?

469
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:24,168
<i>Define "lunch"</i>

470
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,493
<i>- or be disintegrated.</i>
- Okay.

471
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,371
You should not be
wearing that, okay?

472
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:29,942
That is part of
a special anniversary gift

473
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,047
I'm making for Mom.

474
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:37,387
There you go.
You thinking about lunch?

475
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,619
I can give you a handful of
crickets on a bed of lettuce.

476
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:41,350
- No.
- That's what you want.

477
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,637
How did you find this?

478
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,645
- Garage.
- Really?

479
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,807
- Were you looking for it?
- No.

480
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,559
- I found it, though.
- Hmm.

481
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,478
You like
going in the garage, huh?

482
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:54,568
So does Daddy.

483
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:57,492
It's fine, actually. Mom never
wears anything I buy her.

484
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:01,446
So, I'm gonna...

485
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:21,512
No.
We know what it sounds like.

486
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:22,703
Tony, after everything
you've seen,

487
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:23,788
is anything really impossible?

488
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:26,020
Quantum fluctuation messes
with the Planck scale...

489
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,909
which then triggers
the Deutsch Proposition.

490
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:28,977
Can we agree on that?

491
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,231
Thank you.

492
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,519
In layman's terms, it means
you're not coming home.

493
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,103
- I did.
- No.

494
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:36,147
You accidentally survived.

495
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:38,403
It's a billion-to-one
cosmic fluke.

496
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:41,661
And now you wanna pull a...
What do you call it?

497
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:45,039
A time heist?

498
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,325
Yeah, a time heist. Of course.

499
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:48,688
Why didn't we think
of this before?

500
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:51,250
Oh, because it's laughable.
Because it's a pipe dream.

501
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,501
The stones are in the past.

502
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:54,992
We could go back,
we could get them.

503
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,380
We can snap our own fingers.
We can bring everybody back.

504
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,466
Or screw it up worse than
he already has, right?

505
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,639
I don't believe we would.

506
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,762
Gotta say it. I sometimes miss
that giddy optimism.

507
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,351
However, high hopes
won't help...

508
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,478
if there's no logical,
tangible way

509
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:12,024
for me to safely execute
said time heist.

510
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,059
I believe
the most likely outcome

511
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:15,214
will be our collective demise.

512
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:18,072
Not if we strictly follow
the rules of time travel.

513
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,904
All right? It means no talking
to our past selves...

514
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:22,530
no betting on sporting events.

515
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:24,445
I'm gonna stop you
right there, Scott.

516
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,739
Are you seriously telling me

517
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,620
that your plan
to save the universe...

518
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,455
is based on
<i>Back to the Future?</i>

519
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:33,329
- Is it?
- No.

520
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:34,609
Good. You had me
worried there.

521
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:35,818
'Cause that would be
horseshit.

522
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:38,129
That's not how
quantum physics works.

523
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:39,464
Tony.

524
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:42,888
We have to take a stand.

525
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,424
We did stand.
And yet, here we are.

526
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:49,331
I know you got
a lot on the line.

527
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:52,102
You got a wife, a daughter.

528
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,767
But I lost someone
very important to me.

529
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,526
A lotta people did.

530
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:59,689
And now, now we have a chance
to bring her back...

531
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,027
to bring everyone back,

532
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,678
and you're telling me
that you won't even...

533
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,489
That's right, Scott.
I won't even.

534
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:07,538
I can't.

535
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:12,042
Mommy told me
to come and save you.

536
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,541
Good job. I'm saved.

537
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,378
I wish you were coming here
to ask me something else.

538
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,541
Anything else.

539
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:20,422
I'm honestly happy
to see you guys, I just...

540
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:21,878
Oh, look,
the table's set for six.

541
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,462
Tony. I get it.

542
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,927
And I'm happy for you.
I really am.

543
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,217
But this is a second chance.

544
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:31,350
I got my second chance
right here, Cap.

545
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:33,059
Can't roll the dice on it.

546
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:37,063
If you don't talk shop,
you can stay for lunch.

547
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,530
Well, he's scared.

548
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,316
He's not wrong.

549
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,493
Yeah, but, I mean,
what are we gonna do?

550
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:47,018
We need him.
What, are we gonna stop?

551
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:49,781
No, I wanna do it right.

552
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,664
We're gonna need
a really big brain.

553
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:56,916
Bigger than his?

554
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,276
Come on, I feel like
I'm the only one eating here.

555
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,336
Try some of that.

556
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:01,427
Have some eggs.

557
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,260
I'm so confused.

558
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,087
These are confusing times.

559
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,093
Right, no, no.
That's not what I meant.

560
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:09,759
Nah, I get it. I'm kidding!

561
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,140
I know, it's crazy.

562
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,520
I'm wearing shirts now.

563
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:16,524
Yeah. What? How? Why?

564
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:19,318
Five years ago,
we got our asses beat.

565
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,562
Except it was worse for me...

566
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,947
'cause I lost twice.

567
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:24,903
First, Hulk lost,
then Banner lost...

568
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,117
and then, we all lost.

569
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,444
No one blamed you, Bruce.

570
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:29,987
I did.

571
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,060
For years,
I've been treating the Hulk

572
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,270
like he's
some kind of disease...

573
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:35,751
something to get rid of.

574
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:39,167
But then, I start looking
at him as the cure.

575
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,875
Eighteen months
in the gamma lab.

576
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:44,634
I put the brains
and the brawn together...

577
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,045
and now, look at me.

578
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,430
Best of both worlds.

579
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,516
- Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?
- Yes.

580
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,017
Can we get a photo?

581
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:54,429
100%, little person.

582
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,643
Come on, step on up.
Do you mind?

583
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,099
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Thanks.

584
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:00,776
Say "green."

585
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:03,187
- Green.
- Green.

586
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,281
Did you get that?

587
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:05,690
That's a good one.

588
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:08,735
Did you want to grab one
with me? I'm Ant-Man.

589
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,327
They're Hulk fans.
They don't know Ant-Man.

590
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,644
- Nobody does.
- No, he wants you to take

591
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,438
- a picture with him.
- I don't want a picture.

592
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:18,543
Stranger danger.

593
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,232
Yeah, look, he's even
saying no, he doesn't.

594
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,317
I get it.
I don't want it, either.

595
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:22,457
But come on. The kid...

596
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,961
I don't want a picture
with them.

597
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,196
- He's gonna feel bad.
- Sorry.

598
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,614
They're happy to do it.
They said they'll do it.

599
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:28,240
- I don't want to do it.
- We can do it.

600
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:30,367
- No, you feel bad.
- Take the goddamn phone.

601
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:31,598
Okay.

602
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:32,724
Thank you, Mr. Hulk.

603
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:34,872
No, it was great,
kids. Thank you very much.

604
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:36,262
Hulk out!

605
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,475
Bruce.

606
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:38,899
Dab.

607
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:40,850
- Bruce.
- Listen to your mom.

608
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:42,236
She knows better.

609
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,065
About what we were saying.

610
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:45,446
Right.

611
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:50,071
The whole time travel do-over?

612
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:55,115
Eh, guys, it's outside of
my area of expertise.

613
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:56,824
Well, you pulled this off.

614
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:01,666
I remember a time when that
seemed pretty impossible, too.

615
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:36,492
I've got a mild inspiration.

616
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:37,869
I'd like to see
if it checks out.

617
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:40,042
So, I'd like to run
one last sim

618
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:41,710
before we pack it in
for the night.

619
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,873
This time, in the shape
of a Mobius strip,

620
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:46,332
inverted, please.

621
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:47,507
<i>Processing.</i>

622
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:53,464
Right, give me the eigenvalue
of that particle...

623
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,633
factoring in spectral decomp.

624
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,767
- That'll take a second.
<i>- Just a moment.</i>

625
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,681
And don't worry if it doesn't
pan out. I'm just kinda...

626
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,691
<i>Model rendered.</i>

627
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:17,539
Shit!

628
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:19,115
Shit!

629
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:24,971
What are you
doing up, little miss?

630
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:26,755
- Shit.
- Nope. We don't say that.

631
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,132
Only Mommy says that word.

632
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:29,712
She coined it.
It belongs to her.

633
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:30,886
Why are you up?

634
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:32,531
'Cause I've got some
important shit going on here!

635
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:33,716
Why do you think?

636
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,426
No, I got something
on my mind.

637
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:36,848
I got something on my mind.

638
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:38,554
Was it juice pops?

639
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,311
Sure was.

640
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:44,473
That's extortion.
That's a word.

641
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:45,812
What kind you want?

642
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:46,985
Great minds think alike.

643
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:48,985
Juice pops exactly...

644
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:52,273
was on my mind.

645
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:54,817
You done? Yeah?

646
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,577
Now you are.

647
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,324
Here. Wipe.

648
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:03,705
Good. That face goes there.

649
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,119
Tell me a story.

650
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,878
A story.

651
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:09,165
Once upon a time,
Maguna went to bed. The end.

652
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,916
That is a horrible story.

653
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:12,835
Come on,
that's your favorite story.

654
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:14,715
Love you tons.

655
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,556
I love you 3,000.

656
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:20,811
Wow.

657
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:31,020
3,000.
That's crazy.

658
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,027
Go to bed
or I'll sell all your toys.

659
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:36,575
Night night.

660
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:37,951
Not that it's a competition...

661
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,366
but she loves me 3,000.

662
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,621
Does she, now?

663
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:44,829
You were somewhere in
the low 6 to 900 range.

664
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,374
Whatcha reading?

665
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:54,468
Just a book on composting.

666
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,720
What's new with composting?

667
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,219
- Interesting science...
- I figured it out.

668
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,310
By the way.

669
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,348
And, you know,

670
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:06,556
just so we're talking
about the same thing...

671
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:08,190
Time travel.

672
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:09,693
What?

673
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:14,906
Wow.

674
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:20,531
That's amazing...

675
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,613
and terrifying.

676
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,247
That's right.

677
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,256
We got really lucky.

678
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:34,426
Yeah.

679
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:35,710
I know.

680
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:37,003
A lot of people didn't.

681
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,796
Nope. And I can't
help everybody.

682
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:41,890
Sorta seems like you can.

683
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,676
Not if I stop.

684
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:47,722
I can put a pin in it
right now and stop.

685
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:49,524
Tony...

686
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,770
trying to get you to stop...

687
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:54,561
has been one of the few
failures of my entire life.

688
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:00,530
Something tells me...

689
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:02,949
I should put it in a lockbox

690
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,557
and drop it
to the bottom of the lake...

691
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:06,915
and go to bed.

692
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,336
But would you be able to rest?

693
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:23,390
Okay, here we go.
Time travel test number one.

694
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,721
Scott, fire up...

695
00:43:26,646 --> 00:43:27,807
the, uh, van thing.

696
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,144
Breakers are set.

697
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:33,149
Emergency generators
are on standby.

698
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,026
Good, because
if we blow the grid,

699
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:38,322
I don't want to lose, uh,
Tiny here in the 1950s.

700
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:41,366
- Excuse me?
- He's kidding.

701
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:43,402
You can't say things
like that.

702
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:45,158
It was a bad joke.

703
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,166
You were kidding, right?

704
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:51,410
I have no idea. We're talking
about time travel here.

705
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:53,829
Either it's all a joke,
or none of it is.

706
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:55,668
We're good!

707
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:57,174
Get your helmet on.

708
00:43:57,802 --> 00:43:59,668
Scott, I'm gonna
send you back a week...

709
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,378
let you walk around
for an hour,

710
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:02,963
then bring you back
in 10 seconds.

711
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:04,141
Make sense?

712
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:06,050
Perfectly not confusing.

713
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:08,184
Good luck, Scott.
You got this.

714
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:12,768
You're right.
I do, Captain America.

715
00:44:14,944 --> 00:44:16,276
On a count of three...

716
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:20,314
Three, two, one.

717
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:25,240
Uh... Guys?

718
00:44:25,705 --> 00:44:27,287
This doesn't feel right.

719
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:28,373
What is this?

720
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:29,518
- What's going on?
- Who is that?

721
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:30,582
- Hold on.
- Is that Scott?

722
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:31,626
Yes, it's Scott.

723
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:37,122
- What's going on, Bruce?
- Oh, my back!

724
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:38,277
- What is this?
- Hold on a second.

725
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:39,361
Could I get
a little space here?

726
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:40,571
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Can you bring him back?

727
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:41,631
I'm working on it.

728
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:49,686
It's a baby.

729
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:51,390
- It's Scott.
- As a baby.

730
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:53,083
- He'll grow.
- Bring Scott back.

731
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,626
When I say kill the power,
kill the power.

732
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:55,891
Oh, my God.

733
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:57,977
And... kill it!

734
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:04,195
Somebody peed my pants.

735
00:45:04,285 --> 00:45:05,321
Oh, thank God.

736
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:08,703
But I don't know
if it was baby me or old me.

737
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:14,000
Or just me me.

738
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,627
Time travel!

739
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:20,383
What?

740
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:24,295
I see this as an absolute win.

741
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:11,262
Why the long face?

742
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,176
Let me guess,
he turned into a baby.

743
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,430
Among other things, yeah.
What are you doing here?

744
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,018
It's the EPR Paradox.

745
00:46:18,818 --> 00:46:19,878
Instead of pushing Lang
through time,

746
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:20,902
you might've wound up...

747
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:22,439
pushing time through Lang.

748
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:23,729
It's tricky, dangerous.

749
00:46:23,823 --> 00:46:25,425
Somebody could have
cautioned you against it.

750
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,449
You did.

751
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:27,782
Oh, did I?

752
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:29,614
Well, thank God I'm here.

753
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:32,029
Regardless, I fixed it.

754
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:35,411
A fully functioning
time-space GPS.

755
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:38,744
I just want peace.

756
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:43,089
Turns out resentment
is corrosive, and I hate it.

757
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:45,334
Me, too.

758
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,075
We got a shot
at getting these stones,

759
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:50,051
but I gotta tell you
my priorities.

760
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,557
Bring back what we lost,
I hope, yes.

761
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:55,561
Keep what I found,
I have to, at all costs.

762
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:59,397
And maybe not die trying.

763
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:00,603
Would be nice.

764
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,151
Sounds like a deal.

765
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:28,762
Tony, I don't know.

766
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,545
Why?

767
00:47:30,723 --> 00:47:32,510
He made it for you.

768
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,494
Plus, honestly, I have to
get it out of the garage

769
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,259
before Morgan
takes it sledding.

770
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:42,933
Thank you, Tony.

771
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,480
Will you keep that
a little quiet?

772
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:47,597
Didn't bring one
for the whole team.

773
00:47:49,325 --> 00:47:52,614
We are getting
the whole team, yeah?

774
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:54,528
We're working on that
right now.

775
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,676
Hey, Humie.

776
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:16,012
Where's Big Green?

777
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:18,389
The kitchen, I think.

778
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:20,854
That's awesome.

779
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:24,149
Rhodey, careful on re-entry.

780
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:26,025
There's an idiot
in the landing zone.

781
00:48:27,196 --> 00:48:28,312
Oh, God.

782
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:30,943
<i>What's up,
Regular-Sized Man?</i>

783
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:24,250
Kind of a step down
from the golden palaces

784
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:26,077
and the magic hammers
and whatnot.

785
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,579
Hey, have
a little compassion, pal.

786
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:29,713
First, they lost Asgard,
then half their people.

787
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:31,564
They're probably just happy
to have a home.

788
00:49:31,594 --> 00:49:33,301
You shouldn't have come.

789
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:34,969
Ah!

790
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:36,389
Valkyrie!

791
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:39,265
Great to see you, angry girl!

792
00:49:39,435 --> 00:49:41,643
I think I liked you better
either of the other ways.

793
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:44,684
- This is Rocket.
- How ya doing?

794
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:48,109
He won't see you.

795
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:49,480
It's that bad, huh?

796
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,064
We only see him once a month

797
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:54,273
when he comes
in for "supplies."

798
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:56,483
It's that bad.

799
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:57,660
Yeah.

800
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:11,210
What the...?

801
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:16,302
Whew! Something died in here!

802
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:19,677
Hello? Thor!

803
00:50:20,226 --> 00:50:21,888
Are you here
about the cable?

804
00:50:22,645 --> 00:50:24,728
The Cinemax went out
two weeks ago...

805
00:50:25,314 --> 00:50:28,057
and the sports are all
kinda fuzzy and whatnot.

806
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:29,817
Thor?

807
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:40,326
Boys! Oh, my God!

808
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:43,698
Oh, my God,
it's so good to see you!

809
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:46,453
Come here,
cuddly little rascal.

810
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:49,119
Yeah, no, I'm good. I'm good.

811
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:50,336
That's not necessary.

812
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:53,461
Hulk, you know my friends
Miek and Korg, right?

813
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:54,903
- Hey, boys!
- Hey, guys.

814
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:56,168
Long time no see.

815
00:50:56,345 --> 00:50:57,345
Beer's in the bucket.

816
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:58,709
Feel free to log on
to the Wi-Fi.

817
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:00,471
No password, obviously.

818
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:03,050
Thor, he's back.

819
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:05,890
That kid on the TVjust
called me a dickhead again.

820
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:07,474
Noobmaster.

821
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:10,106
Yeah, NoobMaster69
called me a dickhead.

822
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:11,437
I am sick of this.

823
00:51:12,361 --> 00:51:14,023
Noobmaster, hey,
it's Thor again.

824
00:51:14,113 --> 00:51:15,274
You know, the God of Thunder.

825
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:17,728
Listen, bud, if you don't log
off this game immediately...

826
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,274
I am gonna fly over
to your house,

827
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,054
come down to that basement
you're hiding in...

828
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:23,695
rip off your arms,
and shove them up your butt!

829
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,162
Oh, that's right, yes!

830
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:27,115
Go cry to your father,
you little weasel.

831
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:28,835
Thank you, Thor.

832
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,480
Let me know if
he bothers you again, okay?

833
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:31,711
Thank you very much. I will.

834
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:34,150
So, you guys want a drink?
What are we drinking?

835
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:36,587
I've got beer, tequila,
all sorts of things.

836
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:40,882
Buddy.

837
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:43,514
- You all right?
- Yes, I'm fine. Why?

838
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:44,804
Why, don't I look all right?

839
00:51:45,144 --> 00:51:46,555
You look
like melted ice cream.

840
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:50,647
So, what's up? You just here
for a hang, or what?

841
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,933
- We need your help.
- Mm.

842
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:55,314
There might be a chance
we could fix everything.

843
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:56,819
What, like the cable?

844
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:59,192
'Cause that's been
driving me bananas for weeks.

845
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,366
Like Thanos.

846
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:22,387
Don't say that name.

847
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:26,220
Um, yeah, we don't actually
say that name in here.

848
00:52:31,065 --> 00:52:32,931
Please take
your hand off me.

849
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:39,400
Now, I know that guy...

850
00:52:40,324 --> 00:52:41,440
might scare you.

851
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:43,074
Why would I be...?

852
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,324
Why would I be scared
of that guy?

853
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:48,329
I'm the one
who killed that guy, remember?

854
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:49,576
Hmm.

855
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:51,533
Anyone else here
kill that guy?

856
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:56,044
Nope.

857
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:57,590
Didn't think so.

858
00:52:58,676 --> 00:53:00,508
Korg, why don't you, uh,
tell everybody

859
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:02,927
who chopped
Thanos' big head off?

860
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,504
Um, Stormbreaker?

861
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:06,298
Who was swinging
Stormbreaker?

862
00:53:10,396 --> 00:53:12,604
I get it.
You're in a rough spot, okay?

863
00:53:12,773 --> 00:53:13,773
I've been there myself.

864
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:16,228
And you want to know
who helped me out of it?

865
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:18,735
Was it Natasha?

866
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,062
It was you.

867
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,197
You helped me.

868
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:25,867
So, why don't you ask...

869
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:29,287
the Asgardians down there...

870
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:31,163
how much my help is worth?

871
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:38,296
The ones
that are left, anyway.

872
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:40,423
I think we could
bring them back.

873
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:42,341
Stop.

874
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,211
Stop, okay?

875
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:46,512
I know you think I'm down here

876
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,214
wallowing in my own
self-pity...

877
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:50,930
waiting to be rescued
and saved...

878
00:53:51,103 --> 00:53:53,186
but I'm fine, okay.
We're fine, aren't we?

879
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:54,812
Oh, we're good here, mate.

880
00:53:54,982 --> 00:53:57,085
So, whatever it is that you're
offering, we're not into it.

881
00:53:57,109 --> 00:53:58,600
Don't care.
Couldn't care less.

882
00:53:58,777 --> 00:53:59,858
Goodbye.

883
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,947
We need you, pal.

884
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:16,368
There's beer on the ship.

885
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:22,040
What kind?

886
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:11,366
What I want you can't give me.

887
00:56:35,267 --> 00:56:36,428
You shouldn't be here.

888
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:40,887
Neither should you.

889
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:48,361
I've got a job to do.

890
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:51,588
Is that what
you're calling this?

891
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:55,072
Killing all these people isn't
gonna bring your family back.

892
00:57:00,918 --> 00:57:01,999
We found something.

893
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,832
A chance, maybe.

894
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:10,383
Don't.

895
00:57:11,303 --> 00:57:12,760
Don't what?

896
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:17,264
Don't give me hope.

897
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:23,062
I'm sorry I couldn't
give it to you sooner.

898
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:45,914
You're drifting left.

899
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:48,212
One side there, Lebowski.

900
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:52,712
Ratchet, how's it going?

901
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:53,886
It's Rocket.

902
00:57:54,054 --> 00:57:56,592
Take it easy. You're only
a genius on Earth, pal.

903
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,102
Time travel suit,
not bad.

904
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:06,055
Hey, hey, hey!
Easy! Easy!

905
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,149
I'm being very careful.

906
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:08,728
No, you're being very Hulky.

907
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:09,819
I'm being careful.

908
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:11,353
These are Pym Particles,
all right?

909
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:12,840
And ever since
Hank Pym got snapped

910
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:14,105
out of existence, this is it.

911
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:16,079
This is what we have.
We're not making any more.

912
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:18,030
- Scott, calm down.
- Sorry.

913
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:21,329
We've got enough for one
round-trip each. That's it.

914
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:22,534
No do-overs.

915
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:24,915
Plus two test runs.

916
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:29,922
One test run.

917
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:32,840
All right.
I'm not ready for this.

918
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,296
I'm game.

919
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,254
I'll do it.

920
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:40,118
Clint, now you're gonna feel

921
00:58:40,142 --> 00:58:41,703
a little discombobulated
from the chronoshift.

922
00:58:41,727 --> 00:58:42,727
Don't worry about that.

923
00:58:42,811 --> 00:58:44,080
Wait a second.
Let me ask you something.

924
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:45,720
If we can do this, you know...

925
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:48,230
go back in time, why don't
we just find baby Thanos?

926
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,561
You know, and...

927
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:54,646
First of all, that's horrible.

928
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:55,740
It's Thanos.

929
00:58:55,824 --> 00:58:57,907
And secondly,
time doesn't work that way.

930
00:58:58,076 --> 00:59:00,238
Changing the past
doesn't change the future.

931
00:59:00,412 --> 00:59:01,778
Look, we go back,
we get the stones

932
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:03,113
before Thanos gets them...

933
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:06,033
Thanos doesn't have
the stones. Problem solved.

934
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:08,041
- Bingo.
- That's not how it works.

935
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:09,168
Well, that's what I heard.

936
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:10,481
Wait, but who?
Who told you that?

937
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:12,292
<i>Star Trek,
Terminator, Timecop...</i>

938
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:14,048
<i>- Time After Time.
- Quantum Leap.</i>

939
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:15,319
<i>Wrinkle in Time,
Somewhere in Time.</i>

940
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:17,460
<i>Hot Tub Time Machine.</i>

941
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:18,914
<i>Bill and Ted's
Excellent Adventure.</i>

942
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:21,055
Basically, any movie
that deals with time travel.

943
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:23,056
<i>Die Hard.</i>
No, that's not one.

944
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:24,262
This is known.

945
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:25,705
I don't know
why everyone believes that,

946
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:26,765
but that isn't true.

947
00:59:26,855 --> 00:59:28,847
Think about it.
If you travel to the past...

948
00:59:29,024 --> 00:59:31,357
that past becomes
your future...

949
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:34,485
and your former present
becomes the past...

950
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:37,271
which can't now be changed
by your new future.

951
00:59:37,449 --> 00:59:38,656
Exactly.

952
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:42,110
So <i>Back to the Future</i>
is a bunch of bullshit?

953
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:47,998
All right, Clint.

954
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:51,164
We're going in three, two...

955
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:52,338
one.

956
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:06,035
Cooper?

957
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:07,740
Where are my headphones?

958
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:08,831
Lila?

959
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:11,036
- I never had them.
- Lila?

960
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,826
Yeah,
you had them yesterday!

961
01:01:14,421 --> 01:01:15,707
Lila! Lila!

962
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:22,219
Yeah, Dad?

963
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:27,135
Dad?

964
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:30,885
Lila!

965
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:39,193
Hey. Hey, look at me.

966
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:40,478
You okay?

967
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:43,235
Yeah. Yeah.

968
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,321
It worked.

969
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:49,445
It worked.

970
01:01:52,584 --> 01:01:54,416
Okay, so the how works.

971
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:58,124
Now, we gotta figure out
the when and the where.

972
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:00,902
Almost everyone in this room
has had an encounter...

973
01:02:00,926 --> 01:02:02,686
with at least one of
the six Infinity Stones.

974
01:02:02,761 --> 01:02:04,252
Or substitute
the word "encounter"...

975
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:05,510
for "damn near been killed"

976
01:02:05,597 --> 01:02:07,008
by one of
the six Infinity Stones.

977
01:02:07,182 --> 01:02:08,343
Well, I haven't...

978
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:09,433
but I don't even know

979
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:10,995
what the hell
you're all talking about.

980
01:02:11,019 --> 01:02:13,887
Regardless, we only have
enough Pym Particles

981
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,767
for one round-trip each.

982
01:02:15,941 --> 01:02:17,148
And these stones have been

983
01:02:17,234 --> 01:02:19,146
in a lot of different places
throughout history.

984
01:02:19,319 --> 01:02:20,605
Our history.

985
01:02:20,779 --> 01:02:23,772
So, not a lot of convenient
spots to just drop in, yeah?

986
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:25,736
Which means we have to
pick our targets.

987
01:02:26,201 --> 01:02:27,442
Correct.

988
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:30,410
So, let's start
with the Aether.

989
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,787
Thor, what do you know?

990
01:02:37,379 --> 01:02:38,586
Is he asleep?

991
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:41,293
No, no.
I'm pretty sure he's dead.

992
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:46,048
Uh, where to start? Um...

993
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:50,260
The Aether, firstly,
is not a stone.

994
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:52,557
Someone called it
a stone before.

995
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:57,938
Um, it's more of an angry
sludge sort of a thing...

996
01:02:58,108 --> 01:02:59,724
so someone's gonna need
to amend that

997
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:00,979
and stop saying that.

998
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:03,982
Here's an interesting story,
though, about the Aether.

999
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:06,021
My grandfather,
many years ago...

1000
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:09,692
had to hide the stone
from the Dark Elves.

1001
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:12,570
Ooh. Scary beings.

1002
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:14,454
So, Jane, actually...

1003
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,577
Oh, there she is.

1004
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:20,411
Yeah, so Jane was
an old flame of mine.

1005
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:24,627
You know, she stuck her hand
inside a rock this one time...

1006
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:27,635
and then the Aether
stuck itself inside her...

1007
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:29,841
and she became
very, very sick.

1008
01:03:30,015 --> 01:03:31,881
And so I had to
take her to Asgard,

1009
01:03:31,975 --> 01:03:33,136
which is where I'm from...

1010
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:35,267
and we had to try and fix her.

1011
01:03:35,437 --> 01:03:37,053
We were dating at the time,
you see...

1012
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:40,598
and I got to introduce her
to my mother...

1013
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:43,980
who's dead and, um...

1014
01:03:45,405 --> 01:03:46,896
Oh, you know, Jane and I

1015
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:48,902
aren't even
dating anymore, so...

1016
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:51,345
Yes, these things happen,
though. You know?

1017
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:52,763
Nothing lasts forever.
The only thing that...

1018
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:54,747
- Why don't you come sit down?
- I'm not done yet.

1019
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:56,349
The only thing
that is permanent in life

1020
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:57,827
is impermanence.

1021
01:03:58,585 --> 01:04:00,872
Awesome.
Eggs? Breakfast?

1022
01:04:01,046 --> 01:04:03,083
No. I'd like a Bloody Mary.

1023
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:05,416
Quill said he stole
the Power Stone from Morag.

1024
01:04:06,468 --> 01:04:09,176
- Is that a person?
- No, Morag's a planet.

1025
01:04:09,888 --> 01:04:11,254
Quill was a person.

1026
01:04:12,015 --> 01:04:14,348
Like a planet?
Like in outer space?

1027
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:15,928
Oh, look.

1028
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:18,727
It's like a little puppy,
all happy and everything.

1029
01:04:18,897 --> 01:04:22,061
Do you wanna go to space?
You wanna go to space, puppy?

1030
01:04:22,233 --> 01:04:23,349
I'll take you to space.

1031
01:04:24,736 --> 01:04:26,648
Thanos found
the Soul Stone on Vormir.

1032
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:28,778
What is Vormir?

1033
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:30,148
A dominion of death...

1034
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:32,691
at the very center
of celestial existence.

1035
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:38,615
It's where
Thanos murdered my sister.

1036
01:04:45,048 --> 01:04:46,084
Not it.

1037
01:04:47,926 --> 01:04:49,612
- That Time Stone guy.
- Doctor Strange.

1038
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:51,423
Yeah,
what kind of doctor was he?

1039
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:53,553
Ear-nose-throat
meets rabbit-from-hat.

1040
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:55,159
Nice place
in the Village, though.

1041
01:04:55,183 --> 01:04:56,765
Yeah,
on Sullivan Street?

1042
01:04:56,935 --> 01:04:58,079
Mm... Bleecker Street.

1043
01:04:58,103 --> 01:04:59,184
Wait, he lived in New York?

1044
01:04:59,771 --> 01:05:00,873
No, he lived in Toronto.

1045
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:01,999
Uh, yeah,
on Bleecker and Sullivan.

1046
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:03,084
Have you been listening
to anything?

1047
01:05:03,108 --> 01:05:04,108
Guys.

1048
01:05:04,192 --> 01:05:05,854
If you pick the right year,

1049
01:05:05,944 --> 01:05:07,560
there are three stones
in New York.

1050
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:11,738
Shut the front door.

1051
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:16,611
All right.
We have a plan.

1052
01:05:16,788 --> 01:05:21,374
Six stones, three teams,
one shot.

1053
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:32,960
<i>Five years ago,
we lost.</i>

1054
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:35,591
<i>All of us.</i>

1055
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:38,883
<i>We lost friends.</i>

1056
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:41,264
<i>We lost family.</i>

1057
01:05:43,231 --> 01:05:45,063
<i>We lost a part of ourselves.</i>

1058
01:05:46,526 --> 01:05:48,859
<i>Today, we have a chance
to take it all back.</i>

1059
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:53,114
<i>You know your teams.
You know your missions.</i>

1060
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,862
<i>Get the stones. Get them back.</i>

1061
01:05:56,703 --> 01:05:57,864
One round-trip each.

1062
01:05:58,037 --> 01:05:59,118
No mistakes...

1063
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:01,329
no do-overs.

1064
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:03,365
Most of us are going
somewhere we know.

1065
01:06:03,543 --> 01:06:05,423
That doesn't mean
we should know what to expect.

1066
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:07,546
Be careful.

1067
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:09,455
Look out for each other.

1068
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:12,712
This is the fight
of our lives...

1069
01:06:13,595 --> 01:06:15,177
and we're gonna win.

1070
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:18,348
Whatever it takes.

1071
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:23,060
Good luck.

1072
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:24,310
He's pretty good at that.

1073
01:06:24,481 --> 01:06:25,642
- Right?
- All right.

1074
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:26,815
You heard the man.

1075
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:28,141
Stroke those keys,
Jolly Green.

1076
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:30,646
Trackers engaged.

1077
01:06:31,446 --> 01:06:33,424
You promise to bring that back
in one piece, right?

1078
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:34,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1079
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:36,815
Okay, I'll do my best.

1080
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:38,780
As promises go,
that was pretty lame.

1081
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:42,996
See ya in a minute.

1082
01:07:37,428 --> 01:07:38,864
All right, we all have
our assignments.

1083
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:41,096
Two stones uptown,
one stone down.

1084
01:07:41,266 --> 01:07:43,178
Stay low.
Keep an eye on the clock.

1085
01:07:58,658 --> 01:08:00,445
Maybe smash
a few things along the way.

1086
01:08:01,578 --> 01:08:03,570
I think it's gratuitous,
but whatever.

1087
01:08:31,316 --> 01:08:32,835
I'd be careful going that way.

1088
01:08:32,859 --> 01:08:34,475
We just had the floors waxed.

1089
01:08:39,824 --> 01:08:41,440
Yeah, I'm looking
for Doctor Strange.

1090
01:08:43,036 --> 01:08:45,904
You're about
five years too early.

1091
01:08:46,706 --> 01:08:48,823
Stephen Strange is currently
performing surgery

1092
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:50,407
about 20 blocks that way.

1093
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:53,251
What do you want from him?

1094
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:55,130
That, actually.

1095
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:57,171
Ah!

1096
01:08:58,343 --> 01:08:59,343
I'm afraid not.

1097
01:08:59,761 --> 01:09:01,127
Sorry, but I wasn't asking.

1098
01:09:02,055 --> 01:09:03,095
You don't want to do this.

1099
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:04,950
Ah, you're right, I don't.
But I need that stone...

1100
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:06,465
and I don't have time
to debate it.

1101
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:17,067
Let's start over, shall we?

1102
01:09:28,623 --> 01:09:30,205
For you, Lady Jane.

1103
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:32,658
Um, so you have anything
with pants?

1104
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:33,951
Pants?

1105
01:09:34,045 --> 01:09:36,128
Never mind.
These will be fine. Thank you.

1106
01:09:36,297 --> 01:09:38,417
- Yes, milady.
- Oh, there's Jane.

1107
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:40,550
All right.

1108
01:09:42,136 --> 01:09:43,377
Here's the deal, tubby.

1109
01:09:43,554 --> 01:09:44,590
You're gonna charm her,

1110
01:09:44,681 --> 01:09:46,075
and I'm gonna poke her
with this thing...

1111
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:48,557
and extract the Reality Stone,
and get gone lickety-split.

1112
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:51,427
I'll be right back, okay?

1113
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:53,262
The wine cellar
is just down here.

1114
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:56,307
My father used to have this
huge barrel of Aakonian ale.

1115
01:09:56,484 --> 01:09:57,920
I'll see if the scullery has
a couple of to-go cups.

1116
01:09:57,944 --> 01:09:59,776
Hey. Hey! Aren't you
drunk enough already?

1117
01:10:07,161 --> 01:10:08,222
If you could send Loki
some soup.

1118
01:10:08,246 --> 01:10:09,246
Yes, milady.

1119
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:10,330
And ask our librarians

1120
01:10:10,415 --> 01:10:13,249
to pull some volumes
from the astronomy shelf.

1121
01:10:19,424 --> 01:10:20,960
Who's the fancy broad?

1122
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:23,792
That's my mother.

1123
01:10:24,303 --> 01:10:26,010
She dies today.

1124
01:10:26,681 --> 01:10:28,468
Oh, that is today?

1125
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:37,560
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

1126
01:10:38,151 --> 01:10:39,831
I shouldn't be here.
I shouldn't have come.

1127
01:10:39,861 --> 01:10:40,977
It's a bad idea!

1128
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:42,315
- Come here.
- No, no, no.

1129
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:44,901
I think I'm having
a panic attack.

1130
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,991
Come here. Right here.

1131
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:47,355
I shouldn't be here.
This is bad.

1132
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:49,638
You think you're the only one
who lost people?

1133
01:10:49,662 --> 01:10:51,494
What do you think
we're doing here?

1134
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:53,826
I lost the only family
I ever had.

1135
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,413
Quill, Groot, Drax,
the chick with the antenna...

1136
01:10:56,586 --> 01:10:57,997
all gone.

1137
01:10:58,713 --> 01:11:00,045
I get you miss your mom...

1138
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:01,546
but she's gone.

1139
01:11:01,716 --> 01:11:02,716
Really gone.

1140
01:11:03,301 --> 01:11:06,135
And there are plenty of people
who are only kind of gone...

1141
01:11:06,304 --> 01:11:07,420
and you can help them.

1142
01:11:08,556 --> 01:11:10,047
So, is it too much to ask

1143
01:11:10,141 --> 01:11:11,910
that you brush the crumbs
out of your beard...

1144
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:14,221
make schmoopy talk
to Pretty Pants...

1145
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:17,555
and when she's not looking,
suck out the Infinity Stone...

1146
01:11:17,732 --> 01:11:19,314
and help me
get my family back?

1147
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:21,983
Okay.

1148
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:23,278
Are you crying?

1149
01:11:23,905 --> 01:11:25,191
No.

1150
01:11:27,033 --> 01:11:28,194
Yes.

1151
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:29,574
I feel like I'm losing it.

1152
01:11:29,744 --> 01:11:30,744
Get it together!

1153
01:11:30,912 --> 01:11:32,744
You can do this.

1154
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:34,408
You can do this.

1155
01:11:37,585 --> 01:11:38,585
All right?

1156
01:11:38,753 --> 01:11:39,753
Yes, I can.

1157
01:11:39,921 --> 01:11:40,921
Good.

1158
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:45,465
I can do this. I can do this.

1159
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:47,759
I can't do this.

1160
01:11:47,929 --> 01:11:49,795
All right, heartbreaker,
she's alone.

1161
01:11:49,889 --> 01:11:51,346
This is our shot.

1162
01:11:51,516 --> 01:11:54,099
Thor? Thor!

1163
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:05,881
All right,
bring it down, Blue.

1164
01:12:05,905 --> 01:12:08,318
Right on that line. That's it.
Down, down.

1165
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,656
Hey, can we hurry it up?

1166
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:16,914
Guys, chop-chop. Come on.
We're on the clock.

1167
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:18,824
All that is really helpful.

1168
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:22,536
- Take care, okay?
- Yeah.

1169
01:12:22,713 --> 01:12:25,171
Get that stone and come back.
No messing around.

1170
01:12:25,716 --> 01:12:27,378
- Hey.
- We got this.

1171
01:12:27,552 --> 01:12:28,792
- Let's get it done.
- Yes, sir.

1172
01:12:28,928 --> 01:12:30,214
I'll see you back.

1173
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:32,262
You guys watch
each other's six.

1174
01:12:32,932 --> 01:12:34,173
Yeah.

1175
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:44,539
Coordinates for Vormir
are laid in.

1176
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:47,940
All they have to do
is not fall out.

1177
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:56,237
We're a long way
from Budapest.

1178
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:02,618
Okay, so, uh...

1179
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:07,089
we just wait around for
this Quill guy to show up...

1180
01:13:07,258 --> 01:13:09,298
and then he leads us to
the Power Stone, is that it?

1181
01:13:10,094 --> 01:13:11,505
Let's take cover.

1182
01:13:13,139 --> 01:13:15,597
We're not the only ones in
2014 looking for the stones.

1183
01:13:15,683 --> 01:13:17,160
Wait a minute. What are you
talking about right now?

1184
01:13:17,184 --> 01:13:18,624
Who else is looking
for these stones?

1185
01:13:22,148 --> 01:13:23,559
My father...

1186
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:25,520
my sister...

1187
01:13:25,693 --> 01:13:26,809
and me.

1188
01:13:26,986 --> 01:13:28,147
And you?

1189
01:13:30,031 --> 01:13:31,613
Where are you right now?

1190
01:14:00,311 --> 01:14:01,472
You're welcome.

1191
01:14:01,646 --> 01:14:03,933
I didn't ask for your help.

1192
01:14:04,607 --> 01:14:06,223
And yet, you always need it.

1193
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:12,271
Get up. Father wants us
back on the ship.

1194
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:13,448
Why?

1195
01:14:13,616 --> 01:14:15,608
He's found an Infinity Stone.

1196
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:21,579
Where?

1197
01:14:21,749 --> 01:14:23,490
On a planet
called Morag.

1198
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:27,039
Father's plan
is finally in motion.

1199
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:29,205
One stone isn't six, Nebula.

1200
01:14:29,382 --> 01:14:30,589
It's a start.

1201
01:14:30,758 --> 01:14:32,545
If he gets all of them...

1202
01:14:45,564 --> 01:14:47,305
Ronan's located
the Power Stone.

1203
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,107
I'm dispatching you
to his ship.

1204
01:14:49,276 --> 01:14:50,483
He won't like that.

1205
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:52,770
His alternative is death.

1206
01:14:54,281 --> 01:14:56,022
Ronan's obsession...

1207
01:14:57,076 --> 01:14:59,238
clouds his judgment.

1208
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:05,453
We will not fail you, Father.

1209
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:08,118
No, you won't.

1210
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:11,840
I swear...

1211
01:15:13,718 --> 01:15:15,630
I will make you proud.

1212
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:27,684
<i>...we just wait around for
this Quill guy to show up...</i>

1213
01:15:27,857 --> 01:15:29,897
<i>and then he leads us to
the Power Stone, is that it?</i>

1214
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:31,608
<i>Let's take cover.</i>

1215
01:15:32,611 --> 01:15:35,479
<i>We're not the only ones in
2014 looking for the stones.</i>

1216
01:15:37,908 --> 01:15:39,365
Who was that?

1217
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:40,616
I don't know.

1218
01:15:40,703 --> 01:15:42,865
My head is splitting.
I don't know.

1219
01:15:44,331 --> 01:15:47,290
Her synaptic drive was
probably damaged in battle.

1220
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,292
Shh.

1221
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:59,590
Bring her to my ship.

1222
01:16:07,063 --> 01:16:08,206
Better hustle, Cap.

1223
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:10,313
Things look like they're
just about wrapped up here.

1224
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:12,680
<i>Got it. I'm
approaching the elevator now.</i>

1225
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:20,156
If it's all the same
to you...

1226
01:16:22,453 --> 01:16:23,989
I'll have that drink now.

1227
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:26,141
All right,
get him on his feet.

1228
01:16:26,165 --> 01:16:29,158
We can all stand around
posing up a storm later.

1229
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:30,667
By the way,
feel free to clean up.

1230
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:33,837
Mr. Rogers, I almost
forgot that that suit...

1231
01:16:34,006 --> 01:16:35,713
did nothing for your ass.

1232
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:37,235
<i>No one
asked you to look, Tony.</i>

1233
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:38,259
It's ridiculous.

1234
01:16:38,344 --> 01:16:39,529
<i>I think you look great, Cap.</i>

1235
01:16:39,553 --> 01:16:41,966
<i>As far as I'm concerned,
that's America's ass.</i>

1236
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:44,021
Who gets the, uh, magic wand?

1237
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:45,368
S.T.R.I.K.E. team's

1238
01:16:45,392 --> 01:16:46,992
coming to secure it.

1239
01:16:56,487 --> 01:16:58,228
We can take that
off your hands.

1240
01:16:58,405 --> 01:16:59,405
By all means.

1241
01:17:01,659 --> 01:17:03,366
Careful with that thing.

1242
01:17:03,536 --> 01:17:05,056
Yeah, unless you want
your mind erased.

1243
01:17:05,162 --> 01:17:06,162
And not in a fun way.

1244
01:17:06,288 --> 01:17:07,288
We promise to be careful.

1245
01:17:07,373 --> 01:17:08,642
<i>Who are these guys?</i>

1246
01:17:08,666 --> 01:17:09,952
They are S.H.I.E.L.D.

1247
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:13,210
Well, actually Hydra,
but we didn't know that yet.

1248
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:15,541
<i>Seriously?
You didn't?</i>

1249
01:17:15,714 --> 01:17:17,205
<i>I mean,
they look like bad guys.</i>

1250
01:17:17,383 --> 01:17:18,863
You're small,
but you're talking loud.

1251
01:17:18,968 --> 01:17:22,928
On my way down to coordinate
search and rescue.

1252
01:17:23,097 --> 01:17:25,555
I mean, honestly, how do you
keep your food down?

1253
01:17:25,724 --> 01:17:27,135
Shut up.

1254
01:17:27,726 --> 01:17:29,162
Ooh. All right, you're up,
little buddy.

1255
01:17:29,186 --> 01:17:31,303
There's our stone.

1256
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:32,480
<i>All right.</i>

1257
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:33,809
<i>Flick me.</i>

1258
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:48,994
- Move.
- Hey.

1259
01:17:49,081 --> 01:17:50,822
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Hey, hey. Buddy!

1260
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,853
What do you think? Maximum
occupancy has been reached.

1261
01:17:52,877 --> 01:17:53,997
Take the stairs.

1262
01:17:54,128 --> 01:17:55,710
Yeah. Stop, stop.

1263
01:17:58,757 --> 01:18:02,125
"Take the stairs."
Hate the stairs.

1264
01:18:05,264 --> 01:18:07,631
All right, Cap, I got
our scepter in the elevator...

1265
01:18:07,808 --> 01:18:09,595
just passing the 80th floor.

1266
01:18:10,394 --> 01:18:11,394
On it.

1267
01:18:11,979 --> 01:18:12,979
Head to the lobby.

1268
01:18:13,063 --> 01:18:14,457
<i>All right,
I'll see you there.</i>

1269
01:18:14,481 --> 01:18:16,063
Evidence secure.

1270
01:18:16,233 --> 01:18:17,644
We're en route to Doctor List.

1271
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:21,228
No. No hitches at all,
Mr. Secretary.

1272
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:27,410
Captain.

1273
01:18:27,494 --> 01:18:28,680
I thought
you were coordinating

1274
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:29,704
search and rescue.

1275
01:18:29,788 --> 01:18:31,324
Change of plans.

1276
01:18:35,169 --> 01:18:36,580
Hey, Cap.

1277
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:38,916
Rumlow.

1278
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:47,053
I just got a call
from the secretary.

1279
01:18:47,223 --> 01:18:49,089
I'm gonna be running point
on the scepter.

1280
01:18:51,602 --> 01:18:53,844
Sir?
I don't understand.

1281
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:58,195
We got word there may be
an attempt to steal it.

1282
01:18:58,317 --> 01:18:59,899
Sorry, Cap.

1283
01:19:00,069 --> 01:19:01,480
We can't give you the scepter.

1284
01:19:02,071 --> 01:19:03,937
I'm gonna have to call
the director.

1285
01:19:04,114 --> 01:19:06,231
That's okay. Trust me.

1286
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:10,745
Hail Hydra.

1287
01:19:25,469 --> 01:19:27,335
So many stairs!

1288
01:19:39,066 --> 01:19:41,683
Thumbelina, do you copy?
I've got eyes on the prize.

1289
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:42,941
It is go time.

1290
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:44,348
<i>Bombs away.</i>

1291
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:53,737
<i>Is that Axe Body Spray?</i>

1292
01:19:53,914 --> 01:19:56,201
Yeah, I had a can in the desk
for emergencies. Relax.

1293
01:19:56,292 --> 01:19:57,373
Can we focus, please?

1294
01:19:57,543 --> 01:19:58,784
<i>I'm going inside you...</i>

1295
01:19:59,503 --> 01:20:00,503
<i>now.</i>

1296
01:20:06,385 --> 01:20:07,921
Uh, may I ask you
where you're going?

1297
01:20:08,012 --> 01:20:10,345
Bit of lunch and then Asgard.
I'm sorry, you are...?

1298
01:20:10,431 --> 01:20:11,512
Alexander Pierce.

1299
01:20:11,598 --> 01:20:12,884
He's the man above the folks

1300
01:20:12,975 --> 01:20:14,136
- behind Nick Fury.
- Oh.

1301
01:20:14,226 --> 01:20:15,495
My friends call me
Mr. Secretary.

1302
01:20:15,519 --> 01:20:16,519
I'm gonna have to ask you

1303
01:20:16,603 --> 01:20:17,889
to turn that prisoner
over to me.

1304
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:19,846
Uh, Loki will be answering
to Odin himself.

1305
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:21,084
No, he's going
to answer to us.

1306
01:20:21,108 --> 01:20:22,394
Odin can have what's left.

1307
01:20:22,568 --> 01:20:24,025
And I'm gonna need that case.

1308
01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:26,131
That's been S.H.I.E.L.D.
property for over 70 years.

1309
01:20:26,155 --> 01:20:27,195
Hand over the case, Stark.

1310
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:28,758
All right,
move it, Stuart Little.

1311
01:20:28,782 --> 01:20:30,051
Things are getting dicey
out here. Let's go.

1312
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:32,220
I'm not gonna argue who's got
the higher authority here...

1313
01:20:32,244 --> 01:20:33,680
<i>You promise me
you won't die?</i>

1314
01:20:33,704 --> 01:20:36,412
We're only giving me
a mild cardiac dysrhythmia.

1315
01:20:36,582 --> 01:20:38,164
<i>That doesn't sound mild.</i>

1316
01:20:38,334 --> 01:20:39,334
I need the case.

1317
01:20:39,418 --> 01:20:40,854
I know you got a lot of pull,
I'm just saying,

1318
01:20:40,878 --> 01:20:42,355
- jurisdiction...
- Okay, then give me the case.

1319
01:20:42,379 --> 01:20:43,440
Well, jurisdiction...

1320
01:20:43,464 --> 01:20:44,464
Hand it over.

1321
01:20:44,548 --> 01:20:45,548
Do it, Lang!

1322
01:20:45,632 --> 01:20:46,632
Get your hands off me.

1323
01:20:46,717 --> 01:20:48,174
Window's closing. Pull my pin.

1324
01:20:48,635 --> 01:20:49,876
<i>Here goes!</i>

1325
01:20:52,723 --> 01:20:54,259
- Stark?
- Stark?

1326
01:20:55,601 --> 01:20:56,828
He's convulsing.
Give him air!

1327
01:20:56,852 --> 01:20:58,559
- Medic!
- Medic!

1328
01:20:59,104 --> 01:21:00,470
Give these guys some help.

1329
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:02,292
Speak to me.

1330
01:21:02,316 --> 01:21:04,103
Stark,
is it your chest machine?

1331
01:21:06,862 --> 01:21:08,194
Breathe, breathe.

1332
01:21:13,452 --> 01:21:14,763
Good job.
Meet me in the alley.

1333
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:15,947
I'm gonna grab a quick slice.

1334
01:21:21,502 --> 01:21:23,209
No stairs!

1335
01:21:30,344 --> 01:21:32,711
Uh... Come on, Stark,
stay with us.

1336
01:21:32,805 --> 01:21:33,865
I'm going to try something.
Okay?

1337
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:35,329
I have no idea
if it's going to work.

1338
01:21:35,682 --> 01:21:37,844
Yes!

1339
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:39,384
Oh, that worked a treat.

1340
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:40,561
Dude, that was so crazy.

1341
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:42,169
I had no idea
if that was gonna work.

1342
01:21:42,272 --> 01:21:44,138
- The case.
- The case is, uh...

1343
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:46,308
Where's the case?
Where's Loki?

1344
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:48,319
Loki!

1345
01:21:48,404 --> 01:21:49,923
<i>That wasn't supposed
to happen, was it?</i>

1346
01:21:49,947 --> 01:21:51,028
Oh, we blew it.

1347
01:21:51,115 --> 01:21:52,606
Loki?

1348
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:55,946
Tony, what's going on?

1349
01:21:56,954 --> 01:21:58,616
Tell me you found that Cube.

1350
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:02,911
Oh, you gotta be shitting me.

1351
01:22:07,005 --> 01:22:09,213
I have eyes on Loki.
14th floor.

1352
01:22:09,383 --> 01:22:10,749
I'm not Loki...

1353
01:22:14,346 --> 01:22:15,962
and I don't wanna hurt you.

1354
01:22:24,898 --> 01:22:25,898
I can do this all day.

1355
01:22:26,066 --> 01:22:27,352
Yeah, I know.

1356
01:22:27,526 --> 01:22:28,526
I know.

1357
01:23:01,268 --> 01:23:02,268
Where did you get this?

1358
01:23:13,572 --> 01:23:16,610
Bucky is alive.

1359
01:23:20,162 --> 01:23:21,198
What?

1360
01:23:36,136 --> 01:23:37,672
That is America's ass.

1361
01:23:42,059 --> 01:23:43,140
Please, please.

1362
01:23:43,227 --> 01:23:45,093
I'm sorry,
I can't help you, Bruce.

1363
01:23:46,146 --> 01:23:47,478
If I give up the Time Stone

1364
01:23:47,564 --> 01:23:49,271
to help your reality,
I'm dooming my own.

1365
01:23:49,441 --> 01:23:51,182
With all due respect,
all right...

1366
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:54,444
I'm not sure the science
really supports that.

1367
01:24:00,077 --> 01:24:02,034
The Infinity Stones create

1368
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:04,362
what you experience
as the flow of time.

1369
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:06,076
Remove one of the stones...

1370
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:08,333
and that flow splits.

1371
01:24:08,502 --> 01:24:10,960
Now, this may benefit
your reality...

1372
01:24:11,129 --> 01:24:13,246
but my new one, not so much.

1373
01:24:13,632 --> 01:24:15,339
In this new branch reality...

1374
01:24:15,509 --> 01:24:17,171
without our chief weapon

1375
01:24:17,261 --> 01:24:18,593
against the forces
of darkness...

1376
01:24:19,012 --> 01:24:20,924
our world would be overrun.

1377
01:24:21,098 --> 01:24:22,805
Millions will suffer.

1378
01:24:22,975 --> 01:24:24,216
So, tell me, Doctor.

1379
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:26,972
Can your science
prevent all that?

1380
01:24:27,145 --> 01:24:28,145
No...

1381
01:24:29,147 --> 01:24:30,263
but we can erase it.

1382
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:32,147
Because once we're done
with the stones...

1383
01:24:32,317 --> 01:24:34,479
we can return each one
to its own timeline...

1384
01:24:34,653 --> 01:24:36,144
at the moment it was taken.

1385
01:24:36,321 --> 01:24:38,779
So, chronologically...

1386
01:24:39,825 --> 01:24:40,861
in that reality...

1387
01:24:43,453 --> 01:24:45,115
it never left.

1388
01:24:47,499 --> 01:24:50,583
Yes, but you're leaving out
the most important part.

1389
01:24:54,172 --> 01:24:56,630
In order to return the stones,
you have to survive.

1390
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:59,383
We will. I will. I promise.

1391
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:02,257
I can't risk this reality
on a promise.

1392
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:06,675
It's the duty
of the Sorcerer Supreme

1393
01:25:06,768 --> 01:25:08,555
to protect the Time Stone.

1394
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:10,803
Then why the hell did
Strange give it away?

1395
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:13,855
What did you say?

1396
01:25:14,026 --> 01:25:16,359
Strange. He gave it away.
He gave it to Thanos.

1397
01:25:16,987 --> 01:25:18,569
- Willingly?
- Yes.

1398
01:25:22,492 --> 01:25:24,154
- Why?
- I have no idea.

1399
01:25:24,244 --> 01:25:25,985
Maybe he made a mistake.

1400
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:37,417
Or I did.

1401
01:25:57,694 --> 01:26:00,107
Strange is meant to be
the best of us.

1402
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:02,772
So, he must've done it
for a reason.

1403
01:26:03,575 --> 01:26:05,191
I fear you might be right.

1404
01:26:10,374 --> 01:26:11,374
Thank you.

1405
01:26:17,631 --> 01:26:19,293
I'm counting on you, Bruce.

1406
01:26:21,343 --> 01:26:22,550
We all are.

1407
01:26:43,031 --> 01:26:44,567
Run diagnostics.

1408
01:26:45,325 --> 01:26:47,282
Show me her memory file.

1409
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:51,328
Sire, the file
appears entangled.

1410
01:26:52,499 --> 01:26:54,456
It was a memory, but not hers.

1411
01:26:55,711 --> 01:26:57,122
There's another
consciousness...

1412
01:26:57,295 --> 01:26:58,581
sharing her network.

1413
01:26:59,131 --> 01:27:00,463
Another Nebula.

1414
01:27:02,592 --> 01:27:04,049
Impossible.

1415
01:27:04,219 --> 01:27:06,836
This duplicate
carries a time stamp...

1416
01:27:07,764 --> 01:27:09,926
from nine years in the future.

1417
01:27:14,521 --> 01:27:17,013
Where is this other Nebula?

1418
01:27:17,691 --> 01:27:19,683
In our solar system
on Morag.

1419
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:22,522
Can you access her?

1420
01:27:22,696 --> 01:27:24,733
Yes, the two are linked.

1421
01:27:24,906 --> 01:27:26,989
Search the duplicate's
memories...

1422
01:27:27,159 --> 01:27:29,367
for Infinity Stones.

1423
01:27:32,914 --> 01:27:34,142
<i>And these stones have been</i>

1424
01:27:34,166 --> 01:27:36,018
<i>in a lot of different places
throughout history.</i>

1425
01:27:36,042 --> 01:27:37,123
<i>Our history.</i>

1426
01:27:37,210 --> 01:27:39,327
<i>So, not a lot
of convenient spots</i>

1427
01:27:39,504 --> 01:27:40,620
<i>to just drop in.</i>

1428
01:27:40,797 --> 01:27:42,608
<i>Which means
we have to pick our targets.</i>

1429
01:27:42,632 --> 01:27:44,032
<i>- Correct.</i>
- Freeze image.

1430
01:27:45,886 --> 01:27:47,093
Terrans.

1431
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:49,842
Avengers.

1432
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:52,639
Unruly wretches.

1433
01:27:52,809 --> 01:27:54,300
What's that reflection?

1434
01:27:55,937 --> 01:27:57,098
Amplify this, Maw.

1435
01:28:00,609 --> 01:28:01,816
I don't understand.

1436
01:28:06,531 --> 01:28:08,113
Two Nebulas.

1437
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:10,696
No.
The same Nebula...

1438
01:28:11,495 --> 01:28:13,236
from two different times.

1439
01:28:14,539 --> 01:28:16,155
Set course for Morag.

1440
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:18,700
And scan
the duplicate's memories.

1441
01:28:19,461 --> 01:28:21,828
I wanna see everything.

1442
01:28:31,723 --> 01:28:33,680
My ladies, I'll see you after.

1443
01:28:33,767 --> 01:28:35,178
I'll see you after.
Go on ahead.

1444
01:28:49,574 --> 01:28:50,574
What are you doing?

1445
01:28:51,910 --> 01:28:53,401
Oh, God!

1446
01:28:53,578 --> 01:28:56,036
You're better off leaving
the sneaking to your brother.

1447
01:28:56,164 --> 01:28:58,164
No, I wasn't sneaking.
I was just going for a walk.

1448
01:28:58,208 --> 01:28:59,540
What are you wearing?

1449
01:28:59,709 --> 01:29:02,076
I always wear this.
It's one of my favorites.

1450
01:29:05,048 --> 01:29:06,084
Mm...

1451
01:29:06,174 --> 01:29:07,540
What's wrong with your eye?

1452
01:29:07,717 --> 01:29:08,717
Oh, my eye.

1453
01:29:08,885 --> 01:29:10,842
Remember the, uh,
Battle of Harokin...

1454
01:29:11,012 --> 01:29:12,253
when I got hit in the face

1455
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:14,088
with the broadsword?

1456
01:29:17,602 --> 01:29:19,639
You're not the Thor
I know at all, are you?

1457
01:29:20,397 --> 01:29:22,138
Yes, I am.

1458
01:29:22,649 --> 01:29:25,141
The future hasn't been kind
to you, has it?

1459
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:27,522
I didn't say
I was from the future.

1460
01:29:27,988 --> 01:29:30,526
I was raised by witches, boy.

1461
01:29:31,575 --> 01:29:33,942
I see with more than eyes,
you know that.

1462
01:29:36,037 --> 01:29:38,279
Yeah,
I'm totally from the future.

1463
01:29:38,456 --> 01:29:40,072
Yes, you are, honey.

1464
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:41,741
I really need to talk to you.

1465
01:29:41,918 --> 01:29:42,918
We can talk.

1466
01:30:07,068 --> 01:30:09,025
His head was over there...

1467
01:30:09,654 --> 01:30:12,146
and his body over there...

1468
01:30:13,158 --> 01:30:15,946
I mean, what was
the point? I was too late.

1469
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:18,236
I was just standing there.

1470
01:30:19,205 --> 01:30:20,946
Some idiot with an axe.

1471
01:30:21,124 --> 01:30:22,831
Now, you're no idiot.

1472
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:25,542
You're here, aren't you?

1473
01:30:25,754 --> 01:30:28,212
Seeking counsel from
the wisest person in Asgard.

1474
01:30:28,548 --> 01:30:29,584
I am. Yes.

1475
01:30:29,758 --> 01:30:31,090
Idiot, no.

1476
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:32,750
A failure?

1477
01:30:32,928 --> 01:30:34,044
Absolutely.

1478
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:36,007
That's a little bit harsh.

1479
01:30:36,181 --> 01:30:37,672
Do you know
what that makes you?

1480
01:30:38,892 --> 01:30:40,884
Just like everyone else.

1481
01:30:41,061 --> 01:30:43,144
I'm not supposed to be
like everyone else, am I?

1482
01:30:43,229 --> 01:30:44,345
Mm.

1483
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:47,603
Everyone fails at who
they're supposed to be, Thor.

1484
01:30:48,318 --> 01:30:51,356
The measure of a person,
of a hero...

1485
01:30:51,529 --> 01:30:54,897
is how well they succeed
at being who they are.

1486
01:31:00,163 --> 01:31:01,620
I've really missed you, Mom.

1487
01:31:07,504 --> 01:31:09,245
Thor! I got it!

1488
01:31:10,131 --> 01:31:11,667
Get that rabbit!

1489
01:31:14,678 --> 01:31:16,260
Mom, I have to tell you
something.

1490
01:31:16,429 --> 01:31:18,216
No, son, you don't.

1491
01:31:18,390 --> 01:31:20,882
You're here to repair
your future, not mine.

1492
01:31:21,059 --> 01:31:22,721
This is about your future.

1493
01:31:22,811 --> 01:31:24,222
Uh, it's none of my business.

1494
01:31:28,233 --> 01:31:29,474
Hi.

1495
01:31:29,651 --> 01:31:31,643
You must be Mom.

1496
01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:33,380
I got the thing.
Come on. We gotta move.

1497
01:31:33,446 --> 01:31:34,903
Oh, I wish we had more time.

1498
01:31:35,073 --> 01:31:36,905
No, this was a gift.

1499
01:31:37,075 --> 01:31:40,489
Now you go and be the man
you're meant to be.

1500
01:31:40,954 --> 01:31:43,116
- I love you, Mom.
- I love you.

1501
01:31:47,585 --> 01:31:49,497
And eat a salad.

1502
01:31:50,505 --> 01:31:51,621
Come on, we gotta go.

1503
01:31:51,798 --> 01:31:53,380
- Goodbye.
- Three...

1504
01:31:53,550 --> 01:31:54,631
- Two...
- No, wait!

1505
01:31:57,887 --> 01:31:59,094
What am I looking at?

1506
01:31:59,264 --> 01:32:00,721
Oh, sometimes
it takes a second.

1507
01:32:10,191 --> 01:32:12,228
I'm still worthy.

1508
01:32:13,653 --> 01:32:15,269
Oh, boy.

1509
01:32:16,448 --> 01:32:18,360
- Goodbye, Mom.
- Goodbye.

1510
01:32:57,614 --> 01:32:59,230
So, he's an idiot?

1511
01:33:00,575 --> 01:33:01,986
Yeah.

1512
01:33:10,502 --> 01:33:11,709
What's that?

1513
01:33:11,878 --> 01:33:13,744
The tool of a thief.

1514
01:33:21,596 --> 01:33:22,677
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1515
01:33:23,515 --> 01:33:25,131
This is the part
where spikes come out...

1516
01:33:25,308 --> 01:33:26,869
with skeletons on the end
of them and everything.

1517
01:33:26,893 --> 01:33:28,100
What are you talking about?

1518
01:33:28,269 --> 01:33:29,371
When you break into
a place called

1519
01:33:29,395 --> 01:33:30,715
"The Temple
of the Power Stone"...

1520
01:33:30,772 --> 01:33:32,208
there's gonna be
a bunch of booby traps.

1521
01:33:32,232 --> 01:33:34,474
- Oh, my God.
- Okay. All right. Go ahead.

1522
01:34:07,767 --> 01:34:09,258
I wasn't always like this.

1523
01:34:10,186 --> 01:34:11,186
Me either.

1524
01:34:12,981 --> 01:34:14,438
But we work
with what we got, right?

1525
01:34:16,151 --> 01:34:17,232
Hmm.

1526
01:34:18,194 --> 01:34:19,856
Let's sync up.

1527
01:34:21,739 --> 01:34:24,197
Three, two, one.

1528
01:34:37,046 --> 01:34:38,662
<i>You murdered trillions!</i>

1529
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:40,126
<i>You should be grateful.</i>

1530
01:34:41,885 --> 01:34:43,467
<i>Where are the stones?</i>

1531
01:34:43,636 --> 01:34:44,636
<i>Gone.</i>

1532
01:34:45,388 --> 01:34:46,388
<i>Reduced to atoms.</i>

1533
01:34:47,098 --> 01:34:48,760
<i>You used them
two days ago!</i>

1534
01:34:49,058 --> 01:34:52,051
<i>I used the stones
to destroy the stones.</i>

1535
01:34:52,228 --> 01:34:54,060
<i>It nearly killed me.</i>

1536
01:34:54,230 --> 01:34:56,142
<i>But the work is done.</i>

1537
01:34:56,316 --> 01:34:58,148
<i>It always will be.</i>

1538
01:34:59,444 --> 01:35:02,903
<i>I am inevitable.</i>

1539
01:35:04,157 --> 01:35:06,194
What did you do to them?

1540
01:35:06,367 --> 01:35:07,608
Nothing.

1541
01:35:08,494 --> 01:35:09,780
Yet.

1542
01:35:11,581 --> 01:35:13,493
They're not trying
to stop something

1543
01:35:13,583 --> 01:35:15,290
I'm going to do in our time.

1544
01:35:15,627 --> 01:35:17,619
They're trying
to undo something

1545
01:35:17,712 --> 01:35:19,248
I've already done in theirs.

1546
01:35:19,422 --> 01:35:21,084
The stones.

1547
01:35:22,008 --> 01:35:23,920
I found them all.

1548
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:27,086
I won.

1549
01:35:27,847 --> 01:35:30,806
Tipped the cosmic scales
to balance.

1550
01:35:34,812 --> 01:35:36,553
This is your future.

1551
01:35:36,898 --> 01:35:38,935
It's my destiny.

1552
01:35:40,151 --> 01:35:42,188
<i>My father is many things.</i>

1553
01:35:42,362 --> 01:35:44,194
<i>A liar is not one of them.</i>

1554
01:35:45,865 --> 01:35:46,865
<i>Ah.</i>

1555
01:35:47,909 --> 01:35:49,821
<i>Thank you, daughter.</i>

1556
01:35:49,994 --> 01:35:52,156
<i>Perhaps I treated you
too harshly.</i>

1557
01:35:56,668 --> 01:35:59,536
And that is destiny fulfilled.

1558
01:35:59,963 --> 01:36:01,329
Sire...

1559
01:36:01,506 --> 01:36:02,622
your daughter...

1560
01:36:05,093 --> 01:36:06,093
No!

1561
01:36:06,552 --> 01:36:07,588
...is a traitor.

1562
01:36:07,762 --> 01:36:10,220
That's not me.
It's not, I could never...

1563
01:36:10,390 --> 01:36:11,551
I would never betray you.

1564
01:36:11,724 --> 01:36:13,556
Never. Never.

1565
01:36:19,315 --> 01:36:20,476
I know.

1566
01:36:21,442 --> 01:36:24,685
And you'll have the chance
to prove it.

1567
01:36:30,994 --> 01:36:32,075
No!

1568
01:36:32,787 --> 01:36:33,994
He knows!

1569
01:36:38,584 --> 01:36:40,621
Barton! Barton, come in.

1570
01:36:41,254 --> 01:36:42,540
Romanoff!

1571
01:36:43,172 --> 01:36:44,583
Come in, we have a problem.

1572
01:36:44,757 --> 01:36:45,873
Come on!

1573
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:47,461
Come in, we have a...

1574
01:36:47,635 --> 01:36:48,967
Thanos knows.

1575
01:36:49,637 --> 01:36:50,878
Thanos...

1576
01:37:04,610 --> 01:37:05,691
Cap.

1577
01:37:07,322 --> 01:37:09,564
Sorry, buddy,
we got a problem.

1578
01:37:09,699 --> 01:37:11,736
Yeah, we do.

1579
01:37:12,327 --> 01:37:13,470
Well,
what are we gonna do now?

1580
01:37:13,494 --> 01:37:14,638
You know what?
Give me a break, Steve.

1581
01:37:14,662 --> 01:37:16,098
I just got hit in the head
with the Hulk.

1582
01:37:16,122 --> 01:37:17,658
You said
that we had one shot.

1583
01:37:17,832 --> 01:37:19,164
This was our shot.

1584
01:37:19,334 --> 01:37:21,326
We shot it. It's shot.
Six stones or nothing.

1585
01:37:21,502 --> 01:37:23,022
- It was six stones or nothing.
- You're repeating yourself,

1586
01:37:23,046 --> 01:37:24,189
you know that?
You're repeating yourself.

1587
01:37:24,213 --> 01:37:25,941
You're repeating yourself.
You're repeating yourself.

1588
01:37:25,965 --> 01:37:26,965
Dude. Come on!

1589
01:37:27,050 --> 01:37:28,110
No. You never wanted
a time heist.

1590
01:37:28,134 --> 01:37:29,194
You weren't on board
with the time heist.

1591
01:37:29,218 --> 01:37:30,487
- I dropped the ball.
- You ruined the time heist.

1592
01:37:30,511 --> 01:37:31,947
- Is that what I did?
- Yeah.

1593
01:37:31,971 --> 01:37:33,811
Are there any other options
with the Tesseract?

1594
01:37:33,931 --> 01:37:35,284
No, no, no,
there's no other options.

1595
01:37:35,308 --> 01:37:36,549
There's no do-overs.

1596
01:37:36,726 --> 01:37:38,829
We're not going anywhere else.
We have one particle left.

1597
01:37:38,853 --> 01:37:39,853
Each.

1598
01:37:39,979 --> 01:37:42,266
That's it. All right?
We use that...

1599
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:43,640
bye-bye,
you're not going home.

1600
01:37:43,775 --> 01:37:45,732
Yeah, well, if we don't try...

1601
01:37:45,902 --> 01:37:47,212
then no one else
is going home, either.

1602
01:37:47,236 --> 01:37:48,236
I got it.

1603
01:37:49,447 --> 01:37:51,689
There's another way
to retake the Tesseract

1604
01:37:51,783 --> 01:37:53,490
and acquire new particles.

1605
01:37:54,327 --> 01:37:55,527
Little stroll down
memory lane.

1606
01:37:56,162 --> 01:37:57,994
Military installation,
Garden State.

1607
01:38:02,085 --> 01:38:03,371
When were they both there?

1608
01:38:03,544 --> 01:38:05,911
They were there at a time...
I have a vaguely exact idea.

1609
01:38:06,589 --> 01:38:07,649
- How vague?
- What are you

1610
01:38:07,673 --> 01:38:08,776
talking about?
Where are we going?

1611
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:09,860
I know for a fact
they were there.

1612
01:38:09,884 --> 01:38:10,944
Who's they? What are we doing?

1613
01:38:10,968 --> 01:38:12,049
And I know how I know.

1614
01:38:13,971 --> 01:38:15,507
Guys, what is it?

1615
01:38:16,099 --> 01:38:17,715
Looks like we're improvising.

1616
01:38:17,892 --> 01:38:19,161
- Great.
- What are we improvising?

1617
01:38:19,185 --> 01:38:20,926
Scott, get this back
to the compound.

1618
01:38:21,104 --> 01:38:22,104
Suit up.

1619
01:38:22,355 --> 01:38:23,766
- What's in New Jersey?
- 0-4.

1620
01:38:23,856 --> 01:38:24,856
0-4.

1621
01:38:24,982 --> 01:38:26,063
- Uh, 0-7.
- 0-7.

1622
01:38:26,150 --> 01:38:28,016
- Excuse me.
- 1-9-7-0.

1623
01:38:28,486 --> 01:38:29,486
Are you sure?

1624
01:38:29,570 --> 01:38:30,856
Cap? Captain?

1625
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:32,862
Steve? Sorry.

1626
01:38:33,032 --> 01:38:34,648
America. Rogers.

1627
01:38:34,826 --> 01:38:36,033
Look, if you do this...

1628
01:38:36,327 --> 01:38:38,865
and it doesn't work,
you're not coming back.

1629
01:38:39,956 --> 01:38:41,743
Thanks for the pep talk,
pissant.

1630
01:38:42,792 --> 01:38:43,999
You trust me?

1631
01:38:44,877 --> 01:38:46,038
I do.

1632
01:38:47,088 --> 01:38:48,420
Your call.

1633
01:38:49,298 --> 01:38:51,005
Here we go.

1634
01:39:07,066 --> 01:39:10,685
Hey, man!
Make love, not war.

1635
01:39:16,617 --> 01:39:19,280
Clearly you weren't
actually born here, right?

1636
01:39:19,454 --> 01:39:20,945
The idea of me was.

1637
01:39:22,123 --> 01:39:23,809
Right. Well,
imagine you're S.H.I.E.L.D...

1638
01:39:23,833 --> 01:39:27,076
running a quasi-fascistic
intelligence organization...

1639
01:39:28,421 --> 01:39:30,003
where do you hide it?

1640
01:39:30,173 --> 01:39:31,835
In plain sight.

1641
01:40:00,244 --> 01:40:01,513
Good luck
on your mission, Captain.

1642
01:40:01,537 --> 01:40:04,075
Good luck
on your project, Doctor.

1643
01:40:07,502 --> 01:40:08,583
You new here?

1644
01:40:11,130 --> 01:40:12,462
Not exactly.

1645
01:40:19,180 --> 01:40:20,967
Come on, you bastard.

1646
01:40:27,772 --> 01:40:29,263
Gotcha.

1647
01:40:34,153 --> 01:40:35,153
Whew.

1648
01:40:46,791 --> 01:40:48,453
Back in the game.

1649
01:40:51,128 --> 01:40:52,335
Arnim, you in there?

1650
01:40:53,297 --> 01:40:54,333
Arnim?

1651
01:40:59,637 --> 01:41:00,969
Hey!

1652
01:41:01,639 --> 01:41:03,346
The door is this way, pal.

1653
01:41:04,183 --> 01:41:05,219
Oh, yeah.

1654
01:41:05,393 --> 01:41:07,259
Looking for Doctor Zola,
have you seen him?

1655
01:41:07,436 --> 01:41:10,850
Yeah, Doctor Zola.
No, I haven't seen a soul.

1656
01:41:12,358 --> 01:41:13,690
Pardon me.

1657
01:41:14,443 --> 01:41:16,059
Do I know you?

1658
01:41:17,321 --> 01:41:18,321
No, sir. Uh...

1659
01:41:19,782 --> 01:41:21,569
I'm a visitor from MIT.

1660
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:23,275
Oh. MIT.

1661
01:41:23,744 --> 01:41:24,860
Got a name?

1662
01:41:25,329 --> 01:41:26,445
Howard.

1663
01:41:26,622 --> 01:41:29,114
- That'll be easy to remember.
- Howard...

1664
01:41:30,126 --> 01:41:31,126
Potts.

1665
01:41:31,711 --> 01:41:33,919
Well, I'm Howard Stark.

1666
01:41:34,088 --> 01:41:35,088
Hi.

1667
01:41:35,172 --> 01:41:36,458
Shake that, don't pull it.

1668
01:41:36,632 --> 01:41:37,632
Yeah.

1669
01:41:39,051 --> 01:41:41,259
You look a little green around
the gills, there, Potts.

1670
01:41:41,429 --> 01:41:43,591
I'm fine. Just long hours.

1671
01:41:43,764 --> 01:41:45,471
You wanna get some air?

1672
01:41:48,019 --> 01:41:49,806
- Hello, Potts.
- Yeah.

1673
01:41:49,979 --> 01:41:51,220
- That'd be swell.
- That way.

1674
01:41:51,397 --> 01:41:52,397
Okay.

1675
01:41:52,523 --> 01:41:54,185
Need your briefcase?

1676
01:41:58,529 --> 01:42:01,112
You're not one of those
beatniks, are you, Potts?

1677
01:42:06,954 --> 01:42:08,754
- Hello?
<i>- Doctor Pym?</i>

1678
01:42:08,914 --> 01:42:11,122
That would be the
number that you called, yes.

1679
01:42:11,292 --> 01:42:13,534
<i>This is Captain Stevens
from shipping.</i>

1680
01:42:13,711 --> 01:42:14,827
<i>We have a package for you.</i>

1681
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:16,377
Oh, bring it up.

1682
01:42:16,547 --> 01:42:18,504
<i>That's the thing, sir,
we can't.</i>

1683
01:42:19,634 --> 01:42:22,251
I'm confused.
I thought that was your job.

1684
01:42:22,428 --> 01:42:23,794
<i>Well, it's just...</i>

1685
01:42:23,971 --> 01:42:25,428
<i>Sir, the box is glowing...</i>

1686
01:42:25,598 --> 01:42:26,598
<i>and to be honest,</i>

1687
01:42:26,682 --> 01:42:28,535
<i>some of our mail guys
aren't feeling that great.</i>

1688
01:42:28,559 --> 01:42:30,266
They didn't open it, did they?

1689
01:42:30,436 --> 01:42:32,598
<i>Uh, yeah, they did.
You better get down here.</i>

1690
01:42:33,439 --> 01:42:35,351
Excuse me!
Out of the way!

1691
01:43:02,551 --> 01:43:06,044
So, flowers and sauerkraut.
You got a big date tonight?

1692
01:43:06,806 --> 01:43:08,263
Uh, my wife's expecting.

1693
01:43:08,432 --> 01:43:11,266
And too much time
at the office.

1694
01:43:13,104 --> 01:43:14,470
Congratulations.

1695
01:43:14,647 --> 01:43:16,764
- Thanks. Hold this, will ya?
- Yeah, sure.

1696
01:43:17,858 --> 01:43:19,941
- How far along is she?
- Uh, I don't know.

1697
01:43:21,737 --> 01:43:22,853
She's at the point where

1698
01:43:22,947 --> 01:43:24,507
she can't stand
the sound of my chewing.

1699
01:43:24,657 --> 01:43:28,116
I guess I'll be eating dinner
in the pantry again.

1700
01:43:29,036 --> 01:43:30,036
I have a little girl.

1701
01:43:30,204 --> 01:43:31,695
A girl would be nice.

1702
01:43:31,872 --> 01:43:33,864
Less of a chance she'd
turn out exactly like me.

1703
01:43:34,542 --> 01:43:35,999
What'd be so awful about that?

1704
01:43:36,168 --> 01:43:38,160
Let's just say
that the greater good

1705
01:43:38,254 --> 01:43:41,543
has rarely outweighed
my own self-interest.

1706
01:43:45,594 --> 01:43:46,822
And you've never seen
these two men before?

1707
01:43:46,846 --> 01:43:48,782
No, I've got an eye for this.
The two of them looked fishy.

1708
01:43:48,806 --> 01:43:49,806
Can you describe them?

1709
01:43:49,890 --> 01:43:51,090
One of them
had a hippie beard.

1710
01:43:51,225 --> 01:43:53,387
Hippie.
Like Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry?

1711
01:43:53,561 --> 01:43:54,746
Definitely Mungo Jerry.

1712
01:43:54,770 --> 01:43:55,770
Yeah, this is Chesler.

1713
01:43:55,855 --> 01:43:57,082
I need every available MP
to sublevel six.

1714
01:43:57,106 --> 01:43:58,972
We have a potential breach.

1715
01:44:16,876 --> 01:44:17,978
I said bring them in.

1716
01:44:18,002 --> 01:44:19,104
They're trying, ma'am,
but Braddock's unit

1717
01:44:19,128 --> 01:44:20,188
has been stopped
by lightning strikes.

1718
01:44:20,212 --> 01:44:21,248
Oh, for the love of...

1719
01:44:21,338 --> 01:44:22,829
I'll look at
the weather projections.

1720
01:44:46,864 --> 01:44:48,856
It's not lightning strikes
we're looking at.

1721
01:45:00,211 --> 01:45:01,918
So, where you at
with names?

1722
01:45:02,087 --> 01:45:05,205
Well, if it's a boy,
my wife likes Elmonzo.

1723
01:45:05,382 --> 01:45:07,339
Huh. Might wanna
let that stew awhile.

1724
01:45:07,426 --> 01:45:08,883
- You got time.
- Uh-huh.

1725
01:45:10,262 --> 01:45:11,753
Let me ask you a question.

1726
01:45:12,765 --> 01:45:16,008
When your kid was born,
were you nervous?

1727
01:45:16,185 --> 01:45:17,676
Wildly.

1728
01:45:17,770 --> 01:45:19,477
- Yeah.
- Did you feel qualified?

1729
01:45:19,647 --> 01:45:21,513
Like you had any idea

1730
01:45:21,607 --> 01:45:23,223
how to successfully operate
that thing?

1731
01:45:23,651 --> 01:45:26,485
I literally pieced it together
as I went along.

1732
01:45:26,654 --> 01:45:28,646
I thought about
what my dad did.

1733
01:45:29,114 --> 01:45:30,355
My old man,

1734
01:45:30,449 --> 01:45:32,302
he never met a problem
he couldn't solve with a belt.

1735
01:45:32,326 --> 01:45:34,363
I thought my dad
was tough on me.

1736
01:45:34,537 --> 01:45:35,869
And now, looking back on it,

1737
01:45:35,955 --> 01:45:37,241
I just remember
the good stuff.

1738
01:45:37,414 --> 01:45:38,996
You know?
He did drop the odd pearl.

1739
01:45:39,166 --> 01:45:40,532
Yeah? Like what?

1740
01:45:41,669 --> 01:45:44,161
"No amount of money
ever bought a second of time."

1741
01:45:45,506 --> 01:45:46,542
Smart guy.

1742
01:45:46,966 --> 01:45:48,423
He did his best.

1743
01:45:49,802 --> 01:45:51,363
I'll tell you,
that kid's not even here yet

1744
01:45:51,387 --> 01:45:53,754
and there's nothing
I wouldn't do for him.

1745
01:46:02,523 --> 01:46:03,889
Good to meet you, Potts.

1746
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:05,400
Yeah.

1747
01:46:05,818 --> 01:46:06,979
Howard...

1748
01:46:07,570 --> 01:46:09,152
everything's gonna be
all right.

1749
01:46:12,157 --> 01:46:13,398
Thank you...

1750
01:46:14,368 --> 01:46:15,700
for everything...

1751
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:18,407
you've done for this country.

1752
01:46:21,292 --> 01:46:22,408
Jarvis.

1753
01:46:26,130 --> 01:46:27,666
Have we ever met that guy?

1754
01:46:29,675 --> 01:46:31,166
You meet a lot of people, sir.

1755
01:46:33,804 --> 01:46:35,420
Seems very familiar.

1756
01:46:36,348 --> 01:46:37,805
Weird beard.

1757
01:46:45,774 --> 01:46:47,140
You're weak.

1758
01:46:47,693 --> 01:46:48,774
I'm you.

1759
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:08,503
You could stop this.

1760
01:47:08,797 --> 01:47:10,584
You know you want to.

1761
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:13,462
Did you see
what happens in the future?

1762
01:47:14,762 --> 01:47:17,129
Thanos finds the Soul Stone.

1763
01:47:18,682 --> 01:47:20,674
You wanna know
how he does that?

1764
01:47:22,061 --> 01:47:26,226
You wanna know
what he does to you?

1765
01:47:26,732 --> 01:47:27,732
That's enough.

1766
01:47:40,412 --> 01:47:41,994
You disgust me.

1767
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:48,160
But that doesn't mean
you're useless.

1768
01:48:09,858 --> 01:48:11,565
How do I look?

1769
01:48:18,158 --> 01:48:19,158
Wow.

1770
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:23,278
Under different
circumstances...

1771
01:48:23,455 --> 01:48:25,447
this would be totally awesome.

1772
01:48:37,386 --> 01:48:38,752
I bet the raccoon

1773
01:48:38,846 --> 01:48:40,428
didn't have to climb
a mountain.

1774
01:48:40,597 --> 01:48:42,509
Technically he's not
a raccoon, you know?

1775
01:48:42,599 --> 01:48:44,215
Oh, whatever.
He eats garbage.

1776
01:48:44,393 --> 01:48:45,725
Welcome.

1777
01:48:48,897 --> 01:48:50,229
Natasha.

1778
01:48:50,399 --> 01:48:51,399
Daughter of Ivan.

1779
01:48:52,735 --> 01:48:53,851
Clint.

1780
01:48:54,028 --> 01:48:56,315
Son of Edith.

1781
01:49:01,702 --> 01:49:03,159
Who are you?

1782
01:49:03,787 --> 01:49:06,245
Consider me a guide...

1783
01:49:06,415 --> 01:49:08,077
to you...

1784
01:49:08,250 --> 01:49:10,082
and to all who seek
the Soul Stone.

1785
01:49:10,252 --> 01:49:11,288
Oh, good.

1786
01:49:11,462 --> 01:49:13,579
You tell us where it is,
then we'll be on our way.

1787
01:49:17,509 --> 01:49:19,751
If only it were that easy.

1788
01:49:31,857 --> 01:49:35,567
What you seek
lies in front of you.

1789
01:49:36,820 --> 01:49:39,233
As does what you fear.

1790
01:49:44,161 --> 01:49:46,027
The stone's down there.

1791
01:49:46,663 --> 01:49:48,575
For one of you.

1792
01:49:48,874 --> 01:49:50,581
For the other...

1793
01:49:53,253 --> 01:49:55,165
In order to take the stone...

1794
01:49:55,339 --> 01:49:58,332
you must lose
that which you love.

1795
01:49:59,718 --> 01:50:02,882
An everlasting exchange.

1796
01:50:03,889 --> 01:50:07,974
A soul for a soul.

1797
01:50:10,562 --> 01:50:13,145
How's it going?

1798
01:50:15,359 --> 01:50:16,770
Jesus.

1799
01:50:17,111 --> 01:50:18,818
Maybe he's making
this shit up.

1800
01:50:19,696 --> 01:50:21,028
No.

1801
01:50:21,865 --> 01:50:22,865
I don't think so.

1802
01:50:23,575 --> 01:50:25,737
Why? 'Cause he knows
your daddy's name?

1803
01:50:27,246 --> 01:50:28,282
I didn't.

1804
01:50:29,790 --> 01:50:32,157
Thanos left here
with the stone...

1805
01:50:32,835 --> 01:50:34,371
without his daughter.

1806
01:50:34,545 --> 01:50:36,628
That's not a coincidence.

1807
01:50:37,714 --> 01:50:39,330
Yeah.

1808
01:50:41,051 --> 01:50:42,917
Whatever it takes.

1809
01:50:47,432 --> 01:50:48,923
Whatever it takes.

1810
01:50:53,313 --> 01:50:55,270
If we don't get that stone...

1811
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:57,102
billions of people stay dead.

1812
01:50:57,985 --> 01:50:59,146
Yeah.

1813
01:51:01,029 --> 01:51:03,146
Then I guess we both know
who it's gotta be.

1814
01:51:03,907 --> 01:51:05,068
I guess we do.

1815
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:15,617
I'm starting to think we mean

1816
01:51:15,711 --> 01:51:18,203
different people here,
Natasha.

1817
01:51:18,714 --> 01:51:20,692
For the last five years, I've
been trying to do one thing.

1818
01:51:20,716 --> 01:51:21,957
Get to right here.

1819
01:51:22,134 --> 01:51:24,174
That's all it's been about.
Bringing everybody back.

1820
01:51:24,303 --> 01:51:26,511
No, don't you get
all decent on me now.

1821
01:51:26,680 --> 01:51:28,672
What, you think I wanna do it?

1822
01:51:29,266 --> 01:51:31,007
I'm trying to save your life,
you idiot.

1823
01:51:31,185 --> 01:51:33,518
Yeah, well, I don't
want you to. How's that?

1824
01:51:34,438 --> 01:51:36,646
Natasha, you know
what I've done.

1825
01:51:38,317 --> 01:51:40,104
You know what I've become.

1826
01:51:42,237 --> 01:51:44,820
Oh, I don't judge people
on their worst mistakes.

1827
01:51:48,994 --> 01:51:50,235
Maybe you should.

1828
01:51:51,121 --> 01:51:52,657
You didn't.

1829
01:51:58,837 --> 01:52:01,045
You're a pain in my ass,
you know that?

1830
01:52:12,142 --> 01:52:13,349
Okay.

1831
01:52:15,103 --> 01:52:16,594
You win.

1832
01:52:23,070 --> 01:52:24,231
Tell my family I love 'em.

1833
01:52:27,950 --> 01:52:29,157
You tell 'em yourself.

1834
01:53:02,025 --> 01:53:03,025
Damn you.

1835
01:53:10,534 --> 01:53:11,534
Wait.

1836
01:53:19,584 --> 01:53:21,416
Let me go.

1837
01:53:22,671 --> 01:53:23,671
No.

1838
01:53:25,424 --> 01:53:26,424
No. Please, no.

1839
01:53:29,803 --> 01:53:31,635
It's okay.

1840
01:53:33,682 --> 01:53:34,682
Please.

1841
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:37,768
No!

1842
01:55:19,246 --> 01:55:20,246
Did we get 'em all?

1843
01:55:21,665 --> 01:55:23,452
Are you telling me
this actually worked?

1844
01:55:28,296 --> 01:55:29,503
Clint, where's Nat?

1845
01:55:58,743 --> 01:55:59,903
Do we know if she had family?

1846
01:56:00,912 --> 01:56:02,073
Yeah.

1847
01:56:02,247 --> 01:56:03,247
Us.

1848
01:56:04,666 --> 01:56:05,702
What?

1849
01:56:06,585 --> 01:56:07,585
Huh?

1850
01:56:07,669 --> 01:56:08,980
- What are you doing?
- Just asked him a question.

1851
01:56:09,004 --> 01:56:10,398
Yeah, no, you're acting
like she's dead.

1852
01:56:10,422 --> 01:56:11,607
Why are we acting
like she's dead?

1853
01:56:11,631 --> 01:56:12,872
We have the stones, right?

1854
01:56:13,049 --> 01:56:14,193
As long as we have
the stones...

1855
01:56:14,217 --> 01:56:15,977
Cap, we can bring her back.
Isn't that right?

1856
01:56:16,136 --> 01:56:18,281
So, stop this shit. We're the
Avengers. Get it together.

1857
01:56:18,305 --> 01:56:19,512
Can't get her back.

1858
01:56:22,517 --> 01:56:23,758
What's he...?
What?

1859
01:56:23,935 --> 01:56:25,142
It can't be undone.

1860
01:56:25,729 --> 01:56:27,436
It can't.

1861
01:56:29,941 --> 01:56:31,307
Look, I'm sorry, no offense,

1862
01:56:31,401 --> 01:56:33,063
but you're a very
earthly being, okay?

1863
01:56:33,236 --> 01:56:34,636
And we're talking
about space magic.

1864
01:56:34,696 --> 01:56:36,696
And "can't" seems very
definitive. Don't you think?

1865
01:56:36,865 --> 01:56:38,301
Yeah, look,
I know that I'm way outside

1866
01:56:38,325 --> 01:56:39,691
my pay grade here.

1867
01:56:39,868 --> 01:56:41,325
But she still
isn't here, is she?

1868
01:56:41,495 --> 01:56:42,535
No, that's my point.

1869
01:56:42,662 --> 01:56:45,621
It can't be undone.

1870
01:56:45,790 --> 01:56:47,201
Or that's at least

1871
01:56:47,292 --> 01:56:49,124
what the red,
floating guy had to say.

1872
01:56:49,294 --> 01:56:50,751
Maybe you wanna go
talk to him, okay?

1873
01:56:50,921 --> 01:56:53,959
Go grab your hammer and you
go fly and you talk to him.

1874
01:57:02,516 --> 01:57:04,553
It was supposed to be me.

1875
01:57:06,811 --> 01:57:09,098
She sacrificed her life
for that goddamn stone.

1876
01:57:09,272 --> 01:57:10,729
She bet her life on it.

1877
01:57:15,654 --> 01:57:17,987
She's not coming back.

1878
01:57:19,783 --> 01:57:21,240
We have to make it worth it.

1879
01:57:21,826 --> 01:57:23,283
We have to.

1880
01:57:24,704 --> 01:57:26,366
We will.

1881
01:57:51,064 --> 01:57:52,180
Boom!

1882
01:57:57,862 --> 01:57:59,319
All right, the glove's ready.

1883
01:58:00,115 --> 01:58:02,698
Question is, who's gonna
snap their freakin' fingers?

1884
01:58:02,867 --> 01:58:04,950
- I'll do it.
- Excuse me?

1885
01:58:05,078 --> 01:58:06,114
It's okay.

1886
01:58:06,204 --> 01:58:07,265
Stop, stop. Slow down.

1887
01:58:07,289 --> 01:58:08,780
Thor. Just wait.

1888
01:58:08,957 --> 01:58:10,797
We haven't decided
who's gonna put that on yet.

1889
01:58:11,167 --> 01:58:12,812
I'm sorry. What,
we're all just sitting around

1890
01:58:12,836 --> 01:58:14,156
waiting for
the right opportunity?

1891
01:58:14,254 --> 01:58:15,454
We should at least discuss it.

1892
01:58:15,547 --> 01:58:17,504
Look, sitting here
staring at the thing

1893
01:58:17,591 --> 01:58:19,378
is not gonna bring
everybody back.

1894
01:58:20,427 --> 01:58:21,918
I'm the strongest Avenger,
okay?

1895
01:58:22,012 --> 01:58:23,489
So, this responsibility
falls upon me.

1896
01:58:23,513 --> 01:58:24,865
- Normally, you're right.
- It's my duty.

1897
01:58:24,889 --> 01:58:26,809
- It's not about that.
- It's not that.

1898
01:58:26,850 --> 01:58:28,637
- Hey, buddy...
- Stop it! Just let me.

1899
01:58:31,646 --> 01:58:33,137
Just let me do it.

1900
01:58:33,315 --> 01:58:35,807
Just let me do something good.
Something right.

1901
01:58:35,984 --> 01:58:37,128
Look, it's not
just the fact...

1902
01:58:37,152 --> 01:58:38,337
that that glove is channeling
enough energy

1903
01:58:38,361 --> 01:58:39,361
to light up a continent.

1904
01:58:39,446 --> 01:58:41,438
I'm telling you.
You're in no condition.

1905
01:58:41,615 --> 01:58:44,653
What do you think is coursing
through my veins right now?

1906
01:58:44,826 --> 01:58:45,862
Cheez Whiz?

1907
01:58:48,413 --> 01:58:49,413
Lightning.

1908
01:58:49,581 --> 01:58:50,697
- Yeah.
- Lightning.

1909
01:58:50,874 --> 01:58:52,393
Lightning won't help you, pal.

1910
01:58:52,417 --> 01:58:54,249
It's gotta be me.

1911
01:58:55,587 --> 01:58:57,749
You saw what those stones
did to Thanos.

1912
01:58:57,922 --> 01:58:59,458
They almost killed him.

1913
01:59:00,884 --> 01:59:02,750
None of you could survive.

1914
01:59:03,470 --> 01:59:05,086
How do we know
you will?

1915
01:59:05,263 --> 01:59:06,299
We don't.

1916
01:59:06,598 --> 01:59:09,136
But the radiation's
mostly gamma.

1917
01:59:12,646 --> 01:59:14,228
It's like...

1918
01:59:16,107 --> 01:59:18,019
I was made for this.

1919
01:59:36,961 --> 01:59:38,452
Good to go, yeah?

1920
01:59:40,590 --> 01:59:41,590
Let's do it.

1921
01:59:41,758 --> 01:59:43,124
Okay, remember,

1922
01:59:43,218 --> 01:59:44,945
everyone Thanos snapped away
five years ago...

1923
01:59:44,969 --> 01:59:47,427
you're just bringing them
back to now, today.

1924
01:59:47,597 --> 01:59:49,437
Don't change anything
from the last five years.

1925
01:59:50,433 --> 01:59:51,594
Got it.

1926
02:00:07,992 --> 02:00:09,233
<i>Friday, do me a favor</i>

1927
02:00:09,327 --> 02:00:10,927
<i>and activate
Barn Door Protocol, will ya?</i>

1928
02:00:10,954 --> 02:00:12,240
<i>Yes, boss.</i>

1929
02:00:20,839 --> 02:00:22,671
Everybody comes home.

1930
02:00:46,072 --> 02:00:47,483
Take it off! Take it off!

1931
02:00:47,657 --> 02:00:48,817
No, wait.
Bruce, are you okay?

1932
02:00:48,867 --> 02:00:51,154
<i>Talk to me, Banner.</i>

1933
02:00:54,330 --> 02:00:55,330
I'm okay.

1934
02:00:55,832 --> 02:00:57,118
I'm okay.

1935
02:01:28,573 --> 02:01:29,689
Bruce!

1936
02:01:31,451 --> 02:01:33,033
Don't move him.

1937
02:01:39,918 --> 02:01:41,910
- Did it work?
- We're not sure. It's okay.

1938
02:02:28,424 --> 02:02:29,424
Honey.

1939
02:02:29,467 --> 02:02:30,467
<i>Clint?</i>

1940
02:02:30,593 --> 02:02:31,834
Honey.

1941
02:02:32,679 --> 02:02:34,011
Guys...

1942
02:02:36,474 --> 02:02:37,840
I think it worked.

1943
02:03:20,476 --> 02:03:22,342
I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!

1944
02:03:23,605 --> 02:03:25,392
Canopy, canopy, canopy.

1945
02:03:32,030 --> 02:03:33,817
Rhodey, Rocket,
get out of here.

1946
02:03:34,991 --> 02:03:36,527
Let me up! Let me up!

1947
02:03:37,285 --> 02:03:38,285
Come on!

1948
02:03:48,171 --> 02:03:49,171
Rhodey!

1949
02:03:50,798 --> 02:03:51,914
Huh?

1950
02:03:57,555 --> 02:03:59,262
<i>Mayday, Mayday!
Does anybody copy?</i>

1951
02:03:59,349 --> 02:04:00,743
<i>We're on the lower level.
It's flooding!</i>

1952
02:04:00,767 --> 02:04:02,474
What? What?

1953
02:04:02,644 --> 02:04:04,806
<i>We are drowning!
Does anybody copy? Mayday!</i>

1954
02:04:04,979 --> 02:04:07,141
Wait! I'm here!

1955
02:04:07,315 --> 02:04:08,806
I'm here. Can you hear me?

1956
02:04:28,461 --> 02:04:29,668
Cap?

1957
02:04:53,653 --> 02:04:54,769
Okay.

1958
02:05:14,048 --> 02:05:15,164
Daughter.

1959
02:05:15,341 --> 02:05:16,502
Yes, Father.

1960
02:05:18,386 --> 02:05:20,093
So, this is the future.

1961
02:05:20,763 --> 02:05:21,763
Well done.

1962
02:05:22,515 --> 02:05:24,006
Thank you, Father.

1963
02:05:24,183 --> 02:05:25,549
They suspected nothing.

1964
02:05:27,895 --> 02:05:29,352
The arrogant never do.

1965
02:05:32,316 --> 02:05:33,432
Go.

1966
02:05:34,402 --> 02:05:36,815
Find the stones,
bring them to me.

1967
02:05:36,988 --> 02:05:38,695
What will you do?

1968
02:05:40,033 --> 02:05:41,695
Wait.

1969
02:06:06,934 --> 02:06:08,596
Tell me something.

1970
02:06:09,729 --> 02:06:12,142
In the future...

1971
02:06:12,315 --> 02:06:14,181
what happens to you and me?

1972
02:06:16,486 --> 02:06:18,102
I try to kill you.

1973
02:06:19,822 --> 02:06:21,313
Several times.

1974
02:06:22,408 --> 02:06:24,365
But eventually...

1975
02:06:24,535 --> 02:06:26,492
we become friends.

1976
02:06:27,997 --> 02:06:29,704
We become sisters.

1977
02:06:37,381 --> 02:06:38,588
Come on.

1978
02:06:40,635 --> 02:06:42,422
We can stop him.

1979
02:06:50,520 --> 02:06:51,852
Come on, buddy,
wake up!

1980
02:06:51,938 --> 02:06:53,850
That's my man.

1981
02:06:54,774 --> 02:06:56,811
You lose this again,
I'm keeping it.

1982
02:07:00,363 --> 02:07:01,524
What happened?

1983
02:07:01,697 --> 02:07:03,814
You mess with time,
it tends to mess back.

1984
02:07:03,991 --> 02:07:04,991
You'll see.

1985
02:07:26,973 --> 02:07:28,339
What's he been doing?

1986
02:07:30,268 --> 02:07:31,679
Absolutely nothing.

1987
02:07:33,437 --> 02:07:35,303
Where are the stones?

1988
02:07:35,690 --> 02:07:37,522
Somewhere under all this.

1989
02:07:38,901 --> 02:07:41,109
All I know is
he doesn't have 'em.

1990
02:07:41,279 --> 02:07:43,020
So, we keep it that way.

1991
02:07:43,197 --> 02:07:44,563
You know it's a trap, right?

1992
02:07:44,740 --> 02:07:46,072
Yeah.

1993
02:07:46,242 --> 02:07:47,574
I don't much care.

1994
02:07:48,327 --> 02:07:49,327
Good.

1995
02:07:50,288 --> 02:07:52,780
Just as long
as we're all in agreement.

1996
02:08:02,550 --> 02:08:04,542
Let's kill him
properly this time.

1997
02:08:13,936 --> 02:08:16,849
You could not live
with your own failure.

1998
02:08:18,357 --> 02:08:20,189
Where did that bring you?

1999
02:08:23,154 --> 02:08:25,020
Back to me.

2000
02:08:28,451 --> 02:08:31,285
I thought by eliminating
half of life...

2001
02:08:32,038 --> 02:08:34,405
the other half would thrive.

2002
02:08:34,582 --> 02:08:35,914
But you've shown me...

2003
02:08:37,084 --> 02:08:38,825
that's impossible.

2004
02:08:40,755 --> 02:08:44,044
And as long as there are those
that remember what was...

2005
02:08:44,217 --> 02:08:45,708
there will always be those

2006
02:08:45,801 --> 02:08:49,420
that are unable to accept
what can be.

2007
02:08:50,181 --> 02:08:51,422
They will resist.

2008
02:08:51,933 --> 02:08:53,845
Yep, we're all kinds
of stubborn.

2009
02:08:54,769 --> 02:08:56,351
I'm thankful.

2010
02:08:58,522 --> 02:09:00,263
Because now...

2011
02:09:00,441 --> 02:09:02,558
I know what I must do.

2012
02:09:03,027 --> 02:09:05,986
I will shred this universe...

2013
02:09:06,155 --> 02:09:08,192
down to its last atom.

2014
02:09:08,991 --> 02:09:10,653
And then...

2015
02:09:10,826 --> 02:09:13,159
with the stones
you've collected for me...

2016
02:09:13,955 --> 02:09:16,072
create a new one...

2017
02:09:16,249 --> 02:09:18,457
teeming with life...

2018
02:09:18,626 --> 02:09:20,492
that knows not
what it has lost...

2019
02:09:20,670 --> 02:09:23,037
but only
what it has been given.

2020
02:09:26,133 --> 02:09:27,544
A grateful universe.

2021
02:09:28,094 --> 02:09:29,505
Born out of blood.

2022
02:09:29,679 --> 02:09:31,341
They'll never know it.

2023
02:09:32,556 --> 02:09:35,469
Because you won't be alive
to tell them.

2024
02:09:50,074 --> 02:09:51,360
See you
on the other side, man.

2025
02:09:53,703 --> 02:09:55,695
Hang on! I'm coming!

2026
02:10:25,985 --> 02:10:26,985
Yeah!

2027
02:10:41,876 --> 02:10:43,412
Oh, hey.

2028
02:10:43,586 --> 02:10:45,293
I know you.

2029
02:10:48,215 --> 02:10:49,215
Father...

2030
02:10:49,967 --> 02:10:51,378
I have the stones.

2031
02:10:51,552 --> 02:10:52,552
What?

2032
02:10:53,846 --> 02:10:54,846
Stop.

2033
02:10:59,977 --> 02:11:01,388
You're betraying us?

2034
02:11:07,401 --> 02:11:08,687
You don't have to do this.

2035
02:11:11,530 --> 02:11:14,022
I am this.

2036
02:11:14,200 --> 02:11:16,112
No, you're not.

2037
02:11:16,577 --> 02:11:18,443
You've seen what we become.

2038
02:11:24,543 --> 02:11:26,751
Nebula, listen to her.

2039
02:11:28,214 --> 02:11:29,214
You can change.

2040
02:11:35,763 --> 02:11:37,254
He won't let me.

2041
02:11:38,891 --> 02:11:39,891
No!

2042
02:11:59,286 --> 02:12:00,652
Okay, Thor. Hit me.

2043
02:12:17,304 --> 02:12:18,590
<i>Boss, wake up!</i>

2044
02:13:09,899 --> 02:13:11,185
I knew it!

2045
02:14:33,566 --> 02:14:36,400
In all my years of conquest...

2046
02:14:37,695 --> 02:14:39,436
violence...

2047
02:14:40,489 --> 02:14:42,446
slaughter...

2048
02:14:43,576 --> 02:14:45,989
it was never personal.

2049
02:14:48,581 --> 02:14:50,664
But I'll tell you now...

2050
02:14:52,668 --> 02:14:56,457
what I'm about to do
to your stubborn,

2051
02:14:56,547 --> 02:14:58,914
annoying little planet...

2052
02:15:00,676 --> 02:15:02,884
I'm gonna enjoy it...

2053
02:15:03,804 --> 02:15:06,171
very, very much.

2054
02:16:09,662 --> 02:16:11,262
<i>Hey, Cap, you read me?</i>

2055
02:16:17,211 --> 02:16:19,498
<i>Cap, it's Sam.
Can you hear me?</i>

2056
02:16:23,509 --> 02:16:24,920
<i>On your left.</i>

2057
02:17:50,596 --> 02:17:51,882
Is that everyone?

2058
02:17:52,055 --> 02:17:54,263
What? You wanted more?

2059
02:18:20,793 --> 02:18:22,750
Avengers...

2060
02:18:27,883 --> 02:18:28,964
assemble.

2061
02:19:04,169 --> 02:19:05,410
Die!

2062
02:19:26,066 --> 02:19:28,809
No, no, give me that.
You have the little one.

2063
02:19:42,499 --> 02:19:43,499
Hey!

2064
02:19:44,334 --> 02:19:45,334
Holy cow!

2065
02:19:45,502 --> 02:19:46,938
You will not believe
what's been going on.

2066
02:19:46,962 --> 02:19:48,314
Do you remember
when we were in space?

2067
02:19:48,338 --> 02:19:49,704
And I got all dusty?

2068
02:19:49,882 --> 02:19:50,963
And I must've passed out,

2069
02:19:51,049 --> 02:19:52,540
because I woke up
and you were gone.

2070
02:19:52,718 --> 02:19:54,487
But Doctor Strange was there,
right? And he was like...

2071
02:19:54,511 --> 02:19:56,155
"It's been five years.
Come on, they need us."

2072
02:19:56,179 --> 02:19:57,824
And then he started doing
the yellow sparkly thing

2073
02:19:57,848 --> 02:19:58,992
- that he does all the time.
- He did? Oh, no.

2074
02:19:59,016 --> 02:20:01,349
What are you doing?
Oh.

2075
02:20:05,355 --> 02:20:06,846
Oh, this is nice.

2076
02:20:28,629 --> 02:20:29,629
Gamora?

2077
02:20:39,056 --> 02:20:40,718
I thought I lost you.

2078
02:20:44,144 --> 02:20:45,225
Ow.

2079
02:20:45,312 --> 02:20:48,225
Don't touch me!

2080
02:20:51,234 --> 02:20:53,066
You missed the first time.

2081
02:20:53,236 --> 02:20:55,228
Then you got 'em
both the second time.

2082
02:20:57,240 --> 02:20:58,321
This is the one?

2083
02:20:58,492 --> 02:20:59,492
Seriously?

2084
02:20:59,660 --> 02:21:01,652
Your choices were him
or a tree.

2085
02:21:12,464 --> 02:21:13,464
Cap!

2086
02:21:13,632 --> 02:21:15,472
What do you want me to do
with this damn thing?

2087
02:21:18,095 --> 02:21:20,132
Get those stones
as far away as possible!

2088
02:21:20,305 --> 02:21:21,341
No!

2089
02:21:22,516 --> 02:21:24,473
We need to get 'em back
where they came from.

2090
02:21:24,643 --> 02:21:25,643
No way to get 'em back.

2091
02:21:25,727 --> 02:21:27,218
Thanos destroyed
the quantum tunnel.

2092
02:21:27,396 --> 02:21:28,396
Hold on!

2093
02:21:30,107 --> 02:21:32,224
That wasn't
our only time machine.

2094
02:21:38,240 --> 02:21:40,152
Anyone see an ugly brown van
out there?

2095
02:21:40,701 --> 02:21:43,785
Yes! But you're not gonna like
where it's parked!

2096
02:21:43,954 --> 02:21:46,071
Scott, how long you need
to get that thing working?

2097
02:21:47,290 --> 02:21:48,451
Uh, maybe 10 minutes.

2098
02:21:48,625 --> 02:21:50,269
Get it started.
We'll get the stones to you.

2099
02:21:50,293 --> 02:21:51,829
We're on it, Cap.

2100
02:22:01,596 --> 02:22:02,712
Hey.

2101
02:22:02,889 --> 02:22:05,882
You said one out of
14 million, we win, yeah?

2102
02:22:06,810 --> 02:22:07,810
Tell me this is it.

2103
02:22:08,228 --> 02:22:10,094
If I tell you what happens...

2104
02:22:10,272 --> 02:22:11,433
it won't happen.

2105
02:22:15,027 --> 02:22:16,027
You better be right.

2106
02:22:24,453 --> 02:22:25,819
It's a mess back here.

2107
02:22:26,830 --> 02:22:27,830
It's dead.

2108
02:22:29,124 --> 02:22:30,615
- What?
- It's dead.

2109
02:22:30,792 --> 02:22:32,203
I have to hot-wire it.

2110
02:22:35,297 --> 02:22:36,504
Where's Nebula?

2111
02:22:37,632 --> 02:22:38,964
She's not responding.

2112
02:22:39,342 --> 02:22:40,674
Sire...

2113
02:22:50,437 --> 02:22:51,678
Clint!

2114
02:22:53,732 --> 02:22:54,848
Give it to me.

2115
02:23:17,130 --> 02:23:20,498
You took everything from me.

2116
02:23:20,884 --> 02:23:23,217
I don't even know who you are.

2117
02:23:23,386 --> 02:23:25,002
You will.

2118
02:23:47,452 --> 02:23:48,452
I got it!

2119
02:23:50,956 --> 02:23:52,037
Activate Instant Kill.

2120
02:24:15,480 --> 02:24:16,812
Rain fire!

2121
02:24:17,524 --> 02:24:19,436
But, sire, our troops!

2122
02:24:19,609 --> 02:24:21,350
Just do it!

2123
02:24:41,506 --> 02:24:43,873
<i>Uh, is anyone else
seeing this?</i>

2124
02:24:57,814 --> 02:24:58,930
I got this!

2125
02:24:59,191 --> 02:25:00,978
I got this.
Okay, I don't got this.

2126
02:25:01,318 --> 02:25:02,628
<i>Help, somebody help!</i>

2127
02:25:02,652 --> 02:25:04,518
Hey, Queens, heads up!

2128
02:25:14,581 --> 02:25:15,617
Hang on. I got you, kid.

2129
02:25:19,252 --> 02:25:20,563
Hey!
Nice to meet you...

2130
02:25:20,587 --> 02:25:22,419
Oh, my God!

2131
02:25:58,667 --> 02:26:00,124
What the hell is this?

2132
02:26:00,919 --> 02:26:02,146
Friday,
what are they firing at?

2133
02:26:02,170 --> 02:26:04,210
<i>Something just
entered the upper atmosphere.</i>

2134
02:26:17,310 --> 02:26:19,472
Oh, yeah!

2135
02:26:39,374 --> 02:26:41,787
Danvers,
we need an assist here.

2136
02:26:50,552 --> 02:26:53,135
Hi, I'm Peter Parker.

2137
02:26:53,763 --> 02:26:55,174
Hey, Peter Parker.

2138
02:26:55,348 --> 02:26:56,509
You got something for me?

2139
02:27:02,647 --> 02:27:04,887
I don't know how you're gonna
get it through all of that.

2140
02:27:06,401 --> 02:27:07,812
Don't worry.

2141
02:27:08,695 --> 02:27:10,277
She's got help.

2142
02:29:58,072 --> 02:30:01,565
I am inevitable.

2143
02:30:21,721 --> 02:30:23,257
And I...

2144
02:30:24,933 --> 02:30:26,094
am...

2145
02:30:29,812 --> 02:30:31,303
Iron Man.

2146
02:32:30,016 --> 02:32:31,723
Mr. Stark?

2147
02:32:32,143 --> 02:32:34,260
Hey!

2148
02:32:34,395 --> 02:32:37,354
Mr. Stark. Can you hear me?

2149
02:32:37,523 --> 02:32:39,059
It's Peter.

2150
02:32:40,360 --> 02:32:41,976
Hey.

2151
02:32:43,029 --> 02:32:46,067
We won, Mr. Stark.

2152
02:32:47,909 --> 02:32:50,071
We won, Mr. Stark.

2153
02:32:51,704 --> 02:32:54,538
We won!
You did it, sir, you did it.

2154
02:32:54,999 --> 02:32:56,740
I'm sorry.

2155
02:32:56,918 --> 02:32:57,918
Tony.

2156
02:33:11,599 --> 02:33:12,635
Hey.

2157
02:33:12,809 --> 02:33:14,641
Hey, Pep.

2158
02:33:18,940 --> 02:33:20,021
Friday?

2159
02:33:20,191 --> 02:33:22,934
<i>Life functions critical.</i>

2160
02:33:31,536 --> 02:33:32,536
Tony?

2161
02:33:33,788 --> 02:33:34,869
Look at me.

2162
02:33:37,542 --> 02:33:39,454
We're gonna be okay.

2163
02:33:44,173 --> 02:33:46,039
You can rest now.

2164
02:35:31,572 --> 02:35:34,360
<i>Everybody wants
a happy ending, right?</i>

2165
02:35:34,534 --> 02:35:36,742
<i>But it doesn't
always roll that way.</i>

2166
02:35:38,830 --> 02:35:40,492
<i>Maybe this time.</i>

2167
02:35:42,083 --> 02:35:44,746
<i>I'm hoping
if you play this back...</i>

2168
02:35:46,420 --> 02:35:47,752
<i>it's in celebration.</i>

2169
02:35:49,006 --> 02:35:52,670
<i>I hope families are reunited.
I hope we get it back.</i>

2170
02:35:52,844 --> 02:35:54,426
<i>And something like
a normal version</i>

2171
02:35:54,512 --> 02:35:56,754
<i>of the planet
has been restored.</i>

2172
02:35:56,931 --> 02:35:58,888
<i>If there ever was
such a thing.</i>

2173
02:35:59,475 --> 02:36:02,468
<i>God, what a world.
Universe, now.</i>

2174
02:36:03,437 --> 02:36:05,477
<i>If you told me 10 years ago
that we weren't alone...</i>

2175
02:36:05,606 --> 02:36:07,598
<i>let alone to this extent,
I mean,</i>

2176
02:36:07,692 --> 02:36:09,412
<i>I wouldn't have
been surprised...</i>

2177
02:36:09,443 --> 02:36:11,059
<i>but come on, who knew?</i>

2178
02:36:11,237 --> 02:36:14,025
<i>The epic forces
of darkness and light</i>

2179
02:36:14,115 --> 02:36:15,856
<i>that have come into play.</i>

2180
02:36:16,033 --> 02:36:17,740
<i>And for better or worse...</i>

2181
02:36:17,910 --> 02:36:19,572
<i>that's the reality
Morgan's gonna</i>

2182
02:36:19,662 --> 02:36:22,075
<i>have to find a way
to grow up in.</i>

2183
02:36:25,334 --> 02:36:26,126
<i>So, I thought I'd probably</i>

2184
02:36:26,127 --> 02:36:27,271
<i>better record
a little greeting...</i>

2185
02:36:27,295 --> 02:36:30,914
<i>in the case of an untimely
death. On my part.</i>

2186
02:36:31,090 --> 02:36:34,333
<i>Not that death at any time
isn't untimely.</i>

2187
02:36:35,553 --> 02:36:36,947
<i>This time travel thing
that we're gonna</i>

2188
02:36:36,971 --> 02:36:38,587
<i>try and pull off tomorrow...</i>

2189
02:36:38,764 --> 02:36:39,825
<i>it's got me
scratching my head</i>

2190
02:36:39,849 --> 02:36:41,118
<i>about the survivability
of it all.</i>

2191
02:36:41,142 --> 02:36:42,599
<i>That's the thing.</i>

2192
02:36:44,562 --> 02:36:46,474
<i>Then again,
that's the hero gig, right?</i>

2193
02:36:46,647 --> 02:36:47,847
<i>Part of the journey
is the end.</i>

2194
02:36:49,734 --> 02:36:50,854
<i>What am I even tripping for?</i>

2195
02:36:50,902 --> 02:36:52,022
<i>Everything is gonna work out</i>

2196
02:36:52,069 --> 02:36:54,982
<i>exactly the way
it's supposed to.</i>

2197
02:36:58,492 --> 02:37:00,154
<i>I love you 3,000.</i>

2198
02:39:15,087 --> 02:39:17,545
You know,
I wish there was a way

2199
02:39:17,631 --> 02:39:18,838
that I could let her know.

2200
02:39:21,343 --> 02:39:23,460
That we won.

2201
02:39:24,847 --> 02:39:26,554
We did it.

2202
02:39:30,144 --> 02:39:31,931
She knows.

2203
02:39:36,817 --> 02:39:38,900
They both do.

2204
02:39:47,870 --> 02:39:49,030
<i>How you doing, squirt?</i>

2205
02:39:49,121 --> 02:39:50,121
Good.

2206
02:39:50,289 --> 02:39:51,621
- You good?
- Mm-hmm.

2207
02:39:51,791 --> 02:39:54,499
- Good. You hungry?
- Mm-hmm.

2208
02:39:54,919 --> 02:39:55,919
What do you want?

2209
02:39:56,629 --> 02:39:58,040
Cheeseburgers.

2210
02:40:02,843 --> 02:40:05,085
You know,
your dad liked cheeseburgers.

2211
02:40:05,262 --> 02:40:06,673
Okay.

2212
02:40:09,266 --> 02:40:11,508
I'm gonna get you all
the cheeseburgers you want.

2213
02:40:11,685 --> 02:40:12,685
Okay.

2214
02:40:29,453 --> 02:40:30,864
So...

2215
02:40:31,122 --> 02:40:33,284
when can we expect you back?

2216
02:40:34,875 --> 02:40:36,707
Um, about that...

2217
02:40:36,961 --> 02:40:39,123
Thor, your people need a king.

2218
02:40:39,296 --> 02:40:41,162
No, they already have one.

2219
02:40:43,300 --> 02:40:44,300
That's funny.

2220
02:40:49,890 --> 02:40:51,722
Are you being serious?

2221
02:40:55,396 --> 02:40:57,638
It's time for me
to be who I am...

2222
02:40:58,232 --> 02:41:00,815
rather than
who I'm supposed to be.

2223
02:41:02,111 --> 02:41:03,852
But you, you're a leader.

2224
02:41:04,488 --> 02:41:06,195
That's who you are.

2225
02:41:08,701 --> 02:41:10,658
You know, I'd make
a lot of changes around here.

2226
02:41:10,828 --> 02:41:12,319
I'm counting on it...

2227
02:41:12,496 --> 02:41:13,987
Your Majesty.

2228
02:41:24,133 --> 02:41:25,340
What will you do?

2229
02:41:26,093 --> 02:41:27,504
I'm not sure.

2230
02:41:27,678 --> 02:41:29,715
For the first time
in a thousand years,

2231
02:41:29,805 --> 02:41:31,216
I have no path.

2232
02:41:31,390 --> 02:41:32,801
I do have a ride though.

2233
02:41:32,975 --> 02:41:34,932
Move it or lose it, hairbag.

2234
02:41:39,440 --> 02:41:40,976
Oh, here we are!

2235
02:41:41,442 --> 02:41:42,978
Tree, good to see you.

2236
02:41:47,573 --> 02:41:50,862
The Asgardians of the Galaxy
back together again.

2237
02:41:51,285 --> 02:41:53,151
Where to first?

2238
02:41:54,288 --> 02:41:55,324
Hey.

2239
02:41:55,956 --> 02:41:57,913
Just so you know,
this is my ship still.

2240
02:41:58,083 --> 02:41:59,083
I'm in charge.

2241
02:41:59,627 --> 02:42:02,165
I know. I know.
Of course you are.

2242
02:42:02,338 --> 02:42:03,874
Of course.

2243
02:42:06,508 --> 02:42:09,046
See, you say, "Of course,"
but then you touch the map.

2244
02:42:09,220 --> 02:42:10,322
It makes you think that maybe

2245
02:42:10,346 --> 02:42:11,712
you didn't realize
I was in charge.

2246
02:42:12,348 --> 02:42:13,825
Quail, that's your own
insecurities in there.

2247
02:42:13,849 --> 02:42:14,849
Quail?

2248
02:42:15,017 --> 02:42:17,259
Okay? I am merely trying to
be of service and assisting.

2249
02:42:17,436 --> 02:42:18,643
Quill.

2250
02:42:18,812 --> 02:42:19,812
That's what I said.

2251
02:42:19,855 --> 02:42:22,222
You should fight one another
for the honor of leadership.

2252
02:42:22,399 --> 02:42:23,765
Sounds fair.

2253
02:42:26,528 --> 02:42:28,895
- It's not necessary, okay?
- It's not.

2254
02:42:29,073 --> 02:42:30,133
I got some blasters,

2255
02:42:30,157 --> 02:42:31,443
unless you guys
wanna use knives.

2256
02:42:31,617 --> 02:42:33,825
Oh, yes! Please, use knives.

2257
02:42:33,994 --> 02:42:35,075
Yeah. Knives.

2258
02:42:35,246 --> 02:42:36,782
I am Groot.

2259
02:42:42,544 --> 02:42:43,910
Not necessary.

2260
02:42:44,088 --> 02:42:45,568
There shall be
no knifing one another.

2261
02:42:45,714 --> 02:42:48,707
Everybody knows
who's in charge.

2262
02:42:52,304 --> 02:42:53,511
Me.

2263
02:42:54,598 --> 02:42:55,598
Right?

2264
02:42:56,350 --> 02:42:58,558
Yes, you.

2265
02:42:58,811 --> 02:43:01,224
Of course! Of course.

2266
02:43:01,397 --> 02:43:03,059
Of course.

2267
02:43:04,817 --> 02:43:06,353
Remember...

2268
02:43:07,194 --> 02:43:08,401
you have to return the stones

2269
02:43:08,487 --> 02:43:09,631
to the exact moment
you got 'em...

2270
02:43:09,655 --> 02:43:10,655
or you're gonna open up

2271
02:43:10,739 --> 02:43:12,856
a bunch of nasty
alternative realities.

2272
02:43:13,033 --> 02:43:14,033
Don't worry, Bruce.

2273
02:43:14,576 --> 02:43:16,442
Clip all the branches.

2274
02:43:16,996 --> 02:43:18,737
You know, I tried.

2275
02:43:20,040 --> 02:43:22,032
When I had the gauntlet,
the stones,

2276
02:43:22,126 --> 02:43:24,243
I really tried
to bring her back.

2277
02:43:27,548 --> 02:43:29,164
I miss her, man.

2278
02:43:29,550 --> 02:43:30,550
Me too.

2279
02:43:34,638 --> 02:43:37,051
You know, if you want,
I could come with you.

2280
02:43:39,643 --> 02:43:41,100
You're a good man, Sam.

2281
02:43:41,645 --> 02:43:43,181
This one's on me, though.

2282
02:43:47,651 --> 02:43:49,563
Don't do anything stupid
till I get back.

2283
02:43:51,405 --> 02:43:52,646
How can I?

2284
02:43:52,823 --> 02:43:54,610
You're taking
all the stupid with you.

2285
02:44:02,207 --> 02:44:03,994
Gonna miss you, buddy.

2286
02:44:04,376 --> 02:44:05,867
It's gonna be okay, Buck.

2287
02:44:13,260 --> 02:44:15,047
How long is this gonna take?

2288
02:44:15,304 --> 02:44:18,047
For him, as long as he needs.
For us, five seconds.

2289
02:44:23,145 --> 02:44:24,386
You ready, Cap?

2290
02:44:24,563 --> 02:44:26,976
All right, we'll meet you
back here, okay?

2291
02:44:27,649 --> 02:44:28,765
You bet.

2292
02:44:30,277 --> 02:44:31,859
Going quantum.
Three...

2293
02:44:32,446 --> 02:44:33,446
two...

2294
02:44:33,947 --> 02:44:35,154
one.

2295
02:44:37,034 --> 02:44:39,071
And returning in five...

2296
02:44:39,244 --> 02:44:40,244
four...

2297
02:44:40,371 --> 02:44:42,203
three, two...

2298
02:44:42,373 --> 02:44:43,705
one.

2299
02:44:50,964 --> 02:44:51,964
Where is he?

2300
02:44:52,132 --> 02:44:53,932
I don't know. He blew
right by his time stamp.

2301
02:44:54,051 --> 02:44:55,508
He should be here.

2302
02:45:01,016 --> 02:45:02,016
Get him back.

2303
02:45:02,101 --> 02:45:03,370
- I'm trying.
- Get him the hell back.

2304
02:45:03,394 --> 02:45:05,260
- Hey, I said I'm trying.
- Sam.

2305
02:45:29,253 --> 02:45:30,835
Go ahead.

2306
02:45:48,814 --> 02:45:49,814
Cap?

2307
02:45:51,900 --> 02:45:53,641
Hi, Sam.

2308
02:45:56,655 --> 02:45:59,693
So, did something go wrong
or did something go right?

2309
02:46:01,827 --> 02:46:05,662
Well, after I put
the stones back, I thought...

2310
02:46:06,790 --> 02:46:08,122
maybe...

2311
02:46:08,625 --> 02:46:13,416
I'll try some of that life
Tony was telling me to get.

2312
02:46:15,424 --> 02:46:17,541
How'd that work out for ya?

2313
02:46:20,053 --> 02:46:21,464
It was beautiful.

2314
02:46:22,806 --> 02:46:24,513
Good. I'm happy for you.

2315
02:46:24,683 --> 02:46:25,719
Truly.

2316
02:46:26,477 --> 02:46:27,763
Thank you.

2317
02:46:29,104 --> 02:46:30,345
Only thing bumming me out...

2318
02:46:30,522 --> 02:46:32,104
is the fact
I have to live in a world

2319
02:46:32,191 --> 02:46:34,103
without Captain America.

2320
02:46:34,693 --> 02:46:35,854
Oh.

2321
02:46:37,905 --> 02:46:40,693
That reminds me.

2322
02:46:49,208 --> 02:46:50,415
Try it on.

2323
02:47:15,943 --> 02:47:17,434
How does it feel?

2324
02:47:20,030 --> 02:47:21,737
Like it's someone else's.

2325
02:47:24,785 --> 02:47:25,946
It isn't.

2326
02:47:39,299 --> 02:47:40,881
Thank you.

2327
02:47:42,594 --> 02:47:43,880
I'll do my best.

2328
02:47:49,268 --> 02:47:51,180
That's why it's yours.

2329
02:47:52,896 --> 02:47:54,262
You wanna tell me about her?

2330
02:48:00,862 --> 02:48:02,353
No.

2331
02:48:02,781 --> 02:48:04,898
No, I don't think I will.

2332
02:48:05,305 --> 02:49:05,354
