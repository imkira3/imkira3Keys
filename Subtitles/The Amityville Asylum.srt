00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:49,599
Lisa Templeton?

3
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:50,925
Yes, it's me.

4
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,450
Shit! Sorry!

5
00:04:52,475 --> 00:04:54,075
I did not mean that!

6
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,900
Do not worry
about it.

7
00:04:55,925 --> 00:04:57,725
I'm Dr. Elliot
Mixter.

8
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,550
Ahead.

9
00:05:10,775 --> 00:05:12,375
You can sit.

10
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,300
I brought my resume, I know
you've already seen, but...

11
00:05:23,325 --> 00:05:25,425
Just a precaution.
Thank you.

12
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,650
I see you have a lot of
experience in private residences.

13
00:05:35,075 --> 00:05:37,275
Yes, quite.

14
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,700
Well, in an institution like this,
the proposal is very different.

15
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:44,825
It's okay.

16
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,140
I cleaned, in schools and
other huge areas before,

17
00:05:47,151 --> 00:05:48,360
so I'm used to.

18
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:49,875
Yes, I've
noticed that.

19
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:54,100
But when I said I
wanted proposal dec...

20
00:05:54,325 --> 00:05:56,725
sensitive things
we do here.

21
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,150
Of course.

22
00:06:02,275 --> 00:06:04,775
It is likely to
work at night.

23
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,600
At that time patients
are locked up, but...

24
00:06:08,925 --> 00:06:12,425
Many of our patients have
psychological disorders.

25
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,450
So...

26
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:17,875
You can be in situations
that need to clean things...

27
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,100
Men usually are
not clean.

28
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,225
If you know
what I mean.

29
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,750
- If I understand.
- And that bother you?

30
00:06:25,575 --> 00:06:27,475
Not at all.

31
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,800
I have some
experiences in...

32
00:06:30,425 --> 00:06:33,125
My mother was very ill, and I
had to take care of her...

33
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:36,450
And I had to deal with all that
change in your lifestyle...

34
00:06:37,175 --> 00:06:38,875
So you know,
I had to...

35
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,304
learn very quickly,

36
00:06:40,315 --> 00:06:42,210
and it has become a
routine for me then...

37
00:06:43,325 --> 00:06:44,925
How is your
mother now?

38
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,650
She died.

39
00:06:51,475 --> 00:06:53,675
I'm sorry to
hear that.

40
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,000
So...

41
00:06:57,225 --> 00:06:59,225
It is important
to me that...

42
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,884
Everyone who works
here is psychiatrist

43
00:07:01,895 --> 00:07:04,060
or to be responsible
for cleaning...

44
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:08,975
fully understand what the
mission of this hospital.

45
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,600
It's okay.

46
00:07:11,825 --> 00:07:14,625
This building was built
only two years ago...

47
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:19,050
And this institution is already
working almost a year ago, so...

48
00:07:20,075 --> 00:07:22,075
We are still building
our reputation.

49
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,400
But always making clear what
reputation we want to...

50
00:07:27,325 --> 00:07:30,525
And so I invested money
up here of my own pocket.

51
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,650
We just
started, but...

52
00:07:34,575 --> 00:07:37,075
Our ambition is
to convert...

53
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,400
this institution,

54
00:07:38,411 --> 00:07:42,010
one of the largest centers medical
treatment in the country.

55
00:07:43,325 --> 00:07:49,225
Then a requirement to
work is the ability to...

56
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:52,350
Let us be aware of the
needs of our patients.

57
00:07:53,975 --> 00:07:55,975
Unlike some
institutions...

58
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,700
Here the well-being of our
patients comes first.

59
00:08:01,525 --> 00:08:05,025
I admire that, really.
And if I get this job...

60
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,050
I will not
disappoint.

61
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,375
I'm sure not.

62
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,900
OMG! I am so sorry!

63
00:08:14,925 --> 00:08:17,525
- I am sorry!
- It's okay.

64
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,550
- Please, I resolve!
- I'm really sorry.

65
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,975
Yes, good...

66
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,400
thanks for coming.

67
00:08:30,925 --> 00:08:32,525
I'll be in touch.

68
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,050
Thank you.

69
00:08:54,175 --> 00:08:55,975
- Hello?
- Hi dear!

70
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,400
Hello Nancy! How
are you going today?

71
00:09:00,425 --> 00:09:03,025
I was a total mess!

72
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,150
Oh, I'm sure it
was silly...

73
00:09:05,175 --> 00:09:08,076
I know I would never do anything wrong,
not in the way you're thinking...

74
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,100
Surely it is better
than you think.

75
00:09:10,725 --> 00:09:13,325
I sneezed on the head
of the institution.

76
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:15,650
You did what?

77
00:09:15,975 --> 00:09:17,575
I sneezed on him.

78
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,900
It was one
of those...

79
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,525
sneezing coming
from nowhere...

80
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,950
and before I knew it, I
was covered by my mucus.

81
00:09:24,775 --> 00:09:26,375
God, I...

82
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,000
I am sorry.

83
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,125
Okay, I know
you're sorry.

84
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,200
Ok, you can laugh,

85
00:09:37,211 --> 00:09:41,860
but this was my last chance to
get anywhere in this interview.

86
00:09:42,075 --> 00:09:44,475
I did not cause a
good impression.

87
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,300
You should have taken my advice
and have used a cleavage...

88
00:09:48,325 --> 00:09:50,225
No doubt you would have
gotten a job with that.

89
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,950
Please, you know
that's not my style...

90
00:09:51,975 --> 00:09:55,475
So just ríeteme
in the face.

91
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,400
I was such an idiot!

92
00:09:59,825 --> 00:10:01,825
Well, what are
you going to do?

93
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,950
I don't know.

94
00:10:03,975 --> 00:10:06,175
And thanks for laughing
at my stupidity.

95
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,400
Sorry.

96
00:10:08,825 --> 00:10:10,987
I think I will ask a
brochure for assistance,

97
00:10:10,998 --> 00:10:12,598
to pay the rent...

98
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,750
And then maybe...

99
00:10:15,475 --> 00:10:17,175
back to college...

100
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,600
So better qualify
for something else.

101
00:10:19,825 --> 00:10:22,025
Maybe you do something
about what you're writing?

102
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,350
How to make a book, and maybe publish
it or something like that...

103
00:10:26,275 --> 00:10:28,675
I do not know, I have
not written since...

104
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,600
- You know!
- I know!

105
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:37,325
What I will say may sound
cliché, but... time heals.

106
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:40,350
I'm sure you passion
for writing again!

107
00:10:40,575 --> 00:10:41,475
Thank you!

108
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,500
Do you want to
talk about it?

109
00:10:43,825 --> 00:10:45,025
No no!

110
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,050
I think I'll take a big
bowl of ice cream and...

111
00:10:48,075 --> 00:10:49,475
And throw me in
front of the TV.

112
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,400
Comfort food!

113
00:10:51,725 --> 00:10:55,025
If there is a day when the food
is some consolation today!

114
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,350
I can not
discuss that.

115
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,375
Call me tomorrow and
take a coffee together.

116
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,400
Yes of course!

117
00:11:01,925 --> 00:11:03,925
All right.
Bye! -Bye!

118
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,450
Hello!

119
00:11:24,675 --> 00:11:27,675
Lisa, I'm Dr. Mixter
High Hopes hospital.

120
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,400
Really? Hello!

121
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:34,325
I just called to say I
enjoyed today know...

122
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,750
And besides, I would
like to offer the job!

123
00:11:39,075 --> 00:11:40,675
Is there?

124
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,136
Is this a joke
or something?

125
00:11:46,147 --> 00:11:49,110
No, I would really
like to accept.

126
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,725
Really?

127
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:56,050
Of course! Oh, my God,
do not believe it!

128
00:11:57,975 --> 00:12:02,075
If you can come at 9:00
am to sign the contract.

129
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,000
Thank you very very much!
I'm very grateful!

130
00:12:07,025 --> 00:12:09,025
And I will not
disappoint.

131
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,050
I know I will not!

132
00:12:11,075 --> 00:12:13,475
- See you tomorrow.
- OK, see you tomorrow!

133
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,000
Can I help you?

134
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,925
I came for the
cleaning work.

135
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,650
Dr. Mixter
said he would.

136
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:40,975
My name is Delaney.

137
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,100
Let's work together.

138
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,725
How good!

139
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,850
I'll fix this!

140
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,075
We -after start.
Okay!

141
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,165
This is the
storage room!

142
00:13:12,176 --> 00:13:15,410
All you need for the
service is in this place.

143
00:13:15,725 --> 00:13:17,325
Everything is
on the shelves.

144
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:20,050
The most common
service is vacuuming!

145
00:13:20,075 --> 00:13:22,375
This is our
vacuum cleaner.

146
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,100
It is very powerful,
but also very quiet.

147
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,725
Because we will work when
everyone is asleep...

148
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,350
We do not want
to wake them...

149
00:13:30,675 --> 00:13:34,275
It has a telescopic tube,
and an excellent filter.

150
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,400
Much of what we have here you
must be accustomed to using.

151
00:13:38,525 --> 00:13:41,525
Here are some buckets, usually
to mix bleach with water...

152
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,550
You can do it right.

153
00:13:43,575 --> 00:13:47,475
We also have this product
to remove stains...

154
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,200
And we use it to remove stains
from the floor and carpet.

155
00:13:50,525 --> 00:13:54,225
Apply 20 minutes
before scrubbing...

156
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:59,250
But beware, it is very powerful, you
have to wash your hands after use.

157
00:14:00,075 --> 00:14:02,075
One of the worst parts
of the job is that we...

158
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,700
to remove chewed gum
on many surfaces...

159
00:14:04,925 --> 00:14:08,825
And when they are at the bottom
of the tables are dried.

160
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,250
That is very rude!

161
00:14:10,275 --> 00:14:13,075
Yes, and I think most of the time
are employees who do this...

162
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,700
and no patients.

163
00:14:14,925 --> 00:14:17,125
But we have this
gum remover!

164
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,588
It's a bit
complicated to use,

165
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:20,660
but it is easier
to remove the gum.

166
00:14:21,275 --> 00:14:26,475
And the stain is heated to 180
degrees, with a pressure of 7.0...

167
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:31,600
It is about 150 liters of
heated spots per minute.

168
00:14:32,425 --> 00:14:34,425
Do you mind if I see
it as you use it?

169
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:37,550
Just to finish no holes in
the furniture making...

170
00:14:37,575 --> 00:14:39,375
No problem!
No problem!

171
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,000
And now I will show you the most
dangerous chemical that we have!

172
00:14:43,525 --> 00:14:46,925
This is a concrete cleaner!
It is a very toxic product!

173
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:49,050
So you have to wear gloves
and masks like we have here,

174
00:14:49,061 --> 00:14:49,760
agree?

175
00:14:50,175 --> 00:14:54,675
Used to clean concrete,
bricks and rusty metal.

176
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,500
For concrete mix.
With 1/4 water...

177
00:14:57,625 --> 00:15:01,725
Rub with his sleeve,
and wait 5-10 minutes.

178
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:06,050
But in the worst
cases, use it pure.

179
00:15:07,275 --> 00:15:08,475
Do not worry.

180
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,100
There is much
to learn.

181
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:13,025
You must learn everything
in about 3 weeks.

182
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,150
Good for me.

183
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:17,575
Any questions? No, I
think I understand.

184
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,900
Well, follow me.

185
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,425
This is the main
hall of the room B.

186
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:32,550
Someone must clean
cleaning here all night.

187
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:35,239
His work here will
empty the trash,

188
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,785
vacuuming and cleaning
the hallways.

189
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,500
Patients here
are category B.

190
00:15:40,725 --> 00:15:45,925
Those who had a nervous
breakdown, so they are catatonic.

191
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,250
They are harmless.

192
00:15:49,275 --> 00:15:51,275
As Ms.
Hardesty here!

193
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,200
Hello Ms.
Hardesty...

194
00:16:00,825 --> 00:16:03,325
She never spoke a word
since he got here.

195
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:09,450
It just goes room to room,
and back to your room...

196
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,375
Everyday.

197
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,300
Then why do you
talk to her?

198
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,821
Because the beams
seem human,

199
00:16:18,832 --> 00:16:21,035
otherwise just
seem furniture.

200
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,150
That's how we all
lose our humanity.

201
00:16:25,475 --> 00:16:27,475
I like to think
they can hear me.

202
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,100
However, she does
not speak to me.

203
00:16:33,725 --> 00:16:36,225
See you later Ms.
Hardesty ..

204
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,450
Bye!

205
00:16:45,175 --> 00:16:48,175
Patients are locked in
their rooms at night.

206
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,000
But sometimes they need
to be cleaned as well.

207
00:16:52,925 --> 00:16:55,525
During the day the
nurses cleaned.

208
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:59,850
But at night we will be
asked to clean them.

209
00:17:00,275 --> 00:17:02,275
It is not the most
pleasant work...

210
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,700
But only it happens
occasionally.

211
00:17:04,725 --> 00:17:08,325
I get it. Now comes
the most part...

212
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,750
hard work.

213
00:17:12,175 --> 00:17:14,275
Clean dirt is not
the hardest part?

214
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,300
This is very easy compared
to what's behind this door.

215
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,625
What's behind?

216
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:23,850
This leads to the
rooms below.

217
00:17:24,775 --> 00:17:26,375
And that is bad?

218
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,300
We could say that.

219
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,825
Here is where
the patients A.

220
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,050
Criminals
considered crazy.

221
00:17:34,775 --> 00:17:37,875
- Dr Mixter did not mention?
- Yes, good...

222
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,800
These patients can
not be helped.

223
00:17:40,825 --> 00:17:43,325
So they have become,
I do not know why...

224
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,050
The secret of
this hospital.

225
00:17:46,075 --> 00:17:48,275
Dr. Mixter probably
thinks he can help.

226
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,400
Can not.

227
00:17:51,925 --> 00:17:54,725
The staff calls this
place "Blood Runner".

228
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,150
What's that smell?

229
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,375
Always hangs
in the air...

230
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,400
No matter how
friegues the floor...

231
00:18:33,425 --> 00:18:35,425
There is always the
smell of death.

232
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,350
Patients are
dangerous?

233
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,375
Yes, but do not
worry about it.

234
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,200
No need to deal
with them directly.

235
00:18:44,325 --> 00:18:47,525
Let's clean up the
hall. Dusting.

236
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:59,050
He is Jerry Kimble.

237
00:18:59,475 --> 00:19:03,485
He was convicted of
stabbing a woman 49 times

238
00:19:03,496 --> 00:19:05,285
against his own son.

239
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,991
After killing her he
sexually assaulted her,

240
00:19:09,002 --> 00:19:11,910
before strangling
her 4 years.

241
00:19:16,525 --> 00:19:18,225
It is a
dangerous man.

242
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,550
Especially
for women.

243
00:19:22,975 --> 00:19:24,975
This other
patient...

244
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,600
it's even worse!

245
00:19:30,025 --> 00:19:33,325
Here Mr.
Dennis Palmer.

246
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,850
Also it is known as the
Cannibal Long Island.

247
00:19:37,775 --> 00:19:39,775
He was abused
as a child.

248
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,100
So his goals were always
pedophiles and rapists.

249
00:19:44,025 --> 00:19:46,025
The he attracted them
and tortured them.

250
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:50,950
He kept alive parts of their
bodies while they ate.

251
00:19:51,475 --> 00:19:53,075
That's horrible.

252
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,700
The most horrible thing is that
most of the audience thought...

253
00:19:58,925 --> 00:20:02,225
That was a hero!
Ironic, is not it?

254
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,650
She is Sadie
Krenwinkel.

255
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,175
What's your problem?

256
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,200
He was a member of
a sect of witches.

257
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,125
They kidnapped six people for
use in a demonic ritual.

258
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:20,050
5 killed, but one escaped and
told police where they were.

259
00:20:21,075 --> 00:20:23,575
She put their
victims in circles.

260
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,100
And speaking of
crazy stuff.

261
00:20:27,525 --> 00:20:29,609
A media loved
it, but...

262
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,235
it was considered
crazy by the court.

263
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:34,850
Since then it has gone through
some institutions, so...

264
00:20:35,775 --> 00:20:37,475
Now she's here.

265
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,500
We have some strange
stories here.

266
00:20:39,825 --> 00:20:42,425
Well, these are not
the strangest.

267
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:50,950
This is our
resident "nobody".

268
00:20:52,675 --> 00:20:54,975
Sometimes we have
people with amnesia.

269
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,800
Sometimes we discover
who they are.

270
00:20:58,725 --> 00:21:00,725
But we do not know
who this man is.

271
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,150
And who is it?

272
00:21:04,575 --> 00:21:07,775
He came here 6
months ago.

273
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,400
It was found, lying
on the ground...

274
00:21:11,825 --> 00:21:15,425
At first I was like Ms.
Hardesty, catatonic...

275
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:20,850
But then... He
became violent.

276
00:21:21,475 --> 00:21:23,975
A young doctor tried to
measure their vital signs.

277
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:29,800
The patient "X" here hit him so
hard that he broke his legs...

278
00:21:30,225 --> 00:21:33,625
six people were needed
to achieve contain.

279
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:37,350
Now he can not go out or to
exercise during the day.

280
00:21:38,275 --> 00:21:40,675
He still does not
know who he is.

281
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,500
God!

282
00:21:44,825 --> 00:21:47,425
God has nothing to
do with this madman.

283
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,250
OMG!

284
00:22:31,275 --> 00:22:32,875
You scared me!

285
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,200
Should not you be in
bed being so late?

286
00:22:36,725 --> 00:22:38,525
I don't know.

287
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,950
I guess you should
not be here.

288
00:22:41,975 --> 00:22:43,675
You want to
play with me?

289
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,400
I would love to!
Maybe tomorrow...

290
00:22:46,425 --> 00:22:48,725
But I think you should
go back to your bed.

291
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:50,750
It's okay.

292
00:23:04,475 --> 00:23:06,875
- You changed the garbage room?
- Yes.

293
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,200
Good.

294
00:23:10,325 --> 00:23:12,825
It is not even necessary
to change the bulb up.

295
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,450
In the fourth 12.

296
00:23:15,275 --> 00:23:17,675
Are you having
fun. -Nice!

297
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,900
You know, it's
funny... I...

298
00:23:22,725 --> 00:23:24,565
I thought it was not
going to get this job...

299
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:28,850
I did not do well
in the interview.

300
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:32,775
Dr. Mixter said you were the
only interviewed for the job.

301
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,700
- Really?
- Yes.

302
00:23:35,725 --> 00:23:38,026
He must have seen you were the
right person for the job...

303
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,650
The Had no longer to interview
anyone else. -All right.

304
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:45,675
Some tattoos
really great!

305
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,700
Yes, sometimes I
forget that I have.

306
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:52,425
And most of
them mean?

307
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:58,250
It represents many
things we went through.

308
00:23:58,275 --> 00:23:59,875
Like what?

309
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,100
How, that is none
of your business!

310
00:24:05,325 --> 00:24:07,325
I did not want
to intrude.

311
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,950
It's okay.

312
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:12,575
Let's say that the past
be forgotten. Okay?

313
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,700
Fair enough.

314
00:24:17,025 --> 00:24:20,025
So... How was
your first night?

315
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:23,250
It was great. I
saw a girl...

316
00:24:23,675 --> 00:24:25,675
She must have been
about 13 years...

317
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,900
I told him to
go to bed.

318
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:31,225
I think here no
children allowed agree?

319
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:34,350
Are you sure you saw
a girl of that age?

320
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:35,275
Yes

321
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,800
dark hair, and you must not
have more than 13 years...

322
00:24:39,525 --> 00:24:42,025
- It's okay.
- Why?

323
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:45,350
In fact there are
no children here.

324
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:46,675
What?

325
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:50,200
In fact there was no child
of that age here...

326
00:24:50,225 --> 00:24:52,225
I think the younger
patient must have...

327
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,950
twenty. -You are
kidding, right?

328
00:24:55,875 --> 00:24:58,175
Do not! Really!

329
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,900
Well, and what I
saw in the hall?

330
00:25:03,325 --> 00:25:05,325
Are you sure you saw
a girl of that age?

331
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:07,650
Clear!

332
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:12,375
So I must warn Lisa.

333
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,700
This is not a good place
for a girl to be.

334
00:25:34,525 --> 00:25:36,225
He found?

335
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,950
No.

336
00:25:40,275 --> 00:25:42,775
So you who saw
the girl?

337
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,100
Yes.

338
00:25:45,825 --> 00:25:47,825
Are you sure you
saw a girl?

339
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,450
Of course!

340
00:25:52,475 --> 00:25:56,575
I have two employees working to
keep drugs in their place...

341
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,800
Come on...

342
00:25:59,425 --> 00:26:01,425
I did not find
anything.

343
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:04,050
This is very
strange.

344
00:26:06,075 --> 00:26:08,675
It was very uncomfortable,
that I know.

345
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,600
Listen, you do
me a favor.

346
00:26:13,425 --> 00:26:15,725
The next time you see
something you think...

347
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:20,050
Reflect before running to
the hurried over here...

348
00:26:22,775 --> 00:26:26,475
I do not have time to look shit
that does not exist in this place.

349
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,800
You understand?

350
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:32,725
Yes.

351
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,450
Ok.

352
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:36,475
I am sorry.

353
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,500
Do not worry
about it.

354
00:26:44,425 --> 00:26:46,425
It's better to prevent
than to cure.

355
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:51,850
Okay. Can you take
care of cleaning?

356
00:26:59,975 --> 00:27:02,475
- Lisa, can you do me a favor?
- Clear.

357
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,100
You can empty the trash from
the office of Dr. Mixter?

358
00:27:05,425 --> 00:27:07,225
I have to go check
the boiler...

359
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,550
There are claims that the
heater does not work.

360
00:27:09,575 --> 00:27:11,575
- Yes, no problem.
- Thank you.

361
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,500
Dr. Mixter?

362
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:12,325
What the hell are
you doing here?

363
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:15,150
I'm emptying waste.

364
00:28:18,675 --> 00:28:22,175
It's funny, I did not know that Dr.
Mixter leave their trash on the table!

365
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,700
Simply must have
fallen... I do not know.

366
00:28:26,425 --> 00:28:28,225
You know I'll have
to report it.

367
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:29,850
What?

368
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,875
What's up? I did
not see anything.

369
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,600
I discovered, girl.

370
00:28:35,025 --> 00:28:36,525
That's hospital
policy.

371
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:40,150
I just got this job, and
I really need. Please?

372
00:28:42,875 --> 00:28:46,175
Yes. We can
make a deal...

373
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,500
What do you
mean by that?

374
00:28:52,025 --> 00:28:54,379
I am sure that that beautiful mouth
should be good for something,

375
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,990
besides telling
lies...

376
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,250
You are disgusting!

377
00:29:01,775 --> 00:29:03,375
Come on?

378
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,400
You win, and me too.

379
00:29:06,125 --> 00:29:07,725
I would love to...

380
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,050
You'll love it.

381
00:29:11,975 --> 00:29:16,275
You better get out of my way, or
I'll sue for sexual harassment.

382
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,400
You're working here
since five minutes ago.

383
00:29:21,425 --> 00:29:23,425
Who do you think Dr.
Mixter going to believe?

384
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:26,150
A maid whore?

385
00:29:27,575 --> 00:29:29,275
Or a medical
professional?

386
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,900
Pemberton!

387
00:29:31,825 --> 00:29:33,125
Leave her alone!

388
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:35,150
We're not doing
anything here...

389
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:37,375
We're just talking.

390
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,400
What is the problem?

391
00:29:42,225 --> 00:29:43,725
No problem.

392
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,750
Lisa! Come with me.

393
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:48,375
We have a job in
the sector B.

394
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,800
You're good?

395
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,925
I'm fine, I'm
a little...

396
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:06,750
asustada and
intimidated.

397
00:30:06,775 --> 00:30:09,575
Pemberton? If you
get to do that.

398
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,100
Unfortunately, it's
not the worst...

399
00:30:12,525 --> 00:30:15,325
But the other scoundrel,
Hardcastle...

400
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:18,050
They like to be.

401
00:30:18,475 --> 00:30:19,775
You get used to it.

402
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,700
They seem like they are not made
to be in charge of patients.

403
00:30:26,025 --> 00:30:27,625
Let's have a coffee.

404
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:31,650
Like the Laziness
is not it?

405
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:34,375
I like to have
some peace!

406
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,400
Ms. Hardesty, which
makes out of bed?

407
00:31:23,425 --> 00:31:25,225
I forgot, he
does not speak.

408
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,550
Stay there, I'll
call the manager.

409
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:36,175
You'll die here.

410
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,500
What did you say?

411
00:31:48,325 --> 00:31:50,325
I'll call the
manager.

412
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:58,250
Look who's here, "Miss
sexual harassment."

413
00:31:58,575 --> 00:32:00,175
Go to shit!

414
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,200
You are laughing
at what?

415
00:32:03,525 --> 00:32:05,225
If you have a
big mouth.

416
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:09,650
You searched in all
hospitals for a child.

417
00:32:11,175 --> 00:32:13,475
And now she fills her
bag with your balls!

418
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,000
I do not want trouble, but
I came to warn you...

419
00:32:18,425 --> 00:32:20,525
He has a patient outside
his room in the wing B.

420
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,950
You are not a problem
for me dear.

421
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:25,775
I'm professional.

422
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,900
And I suggest that you keep in
that bag while you're here.

423
00:32:32,225 --> 00:32:33,825
Yeah, whatever.

424
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,350
See you later
"dear".

425
00:33:01,075 --> 00:33:02,875
So where you saw
this patient is?

426
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,400
She was here! Who?

427
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:07,625
Mrs. Hardesty.

428
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,550
Mrs. Hardesty?

429
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:14,075
Yes, she even
told me.

430
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,700
Mrs. Hardesty was
here and you spoke?

431
00:33:19,325 --> 00:33:20,925
Yes!

432
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,750
Look, I know
you're catatonic!

433
00:33:26,175 --> 00:33:27,975
But she told
me okay?

434
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Catatonic would be
at least strange.

435
00:33:31,425 --> 00:33:33,025
What do you mean?

436
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:35,250
Mrs. Hardesty,
died this morning.

437
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:38,675
But I can swear...

438
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,700
Why do not you go back
to do the cleaning?

439
00:33:42,825 --> 00:33:44,425
Or perhaps you are on
the side of Fools?

440
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,150
Ok mi querida?

441
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:06,375
Hey, wait girl!

442
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,100
Hey, do not go
down there!

443
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:22,225
Open up!

444
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:57,450
Girl?

445
00:35:39,175 --> 00:35:40,775
Palmer?

446
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,400
- Palmer?
- Yes!

447
00:35:45,725 --> 00:35:47,725
My dick is so
hard Palmer!

448
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:52,950
So hard I can
barely stand it.

449
00:35:54,575 --> 00:35:56,975
I can break the
wall with it.

450
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
And do bad
things with you!

451
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:03,325
Things very,
very bad!

452
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:06,150
I must warn Mr.
Kimble...

453
00:36:06,675 --> 00:36:09,275
Threats are
not welcome!

454
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,600
I'm pajeando palmer!

455
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:18,225
You want to see?

456
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,950
You fucking fagot!

457
00:36:21,575 --> 00:36:23,787
Stay out of my
sight Mr. Kimble,

458
00:36:23,798 --> 00:36:25,685
and I'll stay
out of yours.

459
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,100
I know you're
out there girl.

460
00:36:42,125 --> 00:36:44,125
I feel the smell
of your shell!

461
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:48,950
You want to join my?

462
00:36:49,475 --> 00:36:51,075
Come on.

463
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,400
Ok, the next thing to do is
mopping the floor and so ended.

464
00:38:24,725 --> 00:38:27,625
You can do that?
Maybe...

465
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:30,450
Why? What is
the problem?

466
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,575
Is that...

467
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,700
I do not feel good, so I thought
I'd take a little break...

468
00:38:39,125 --> 00:38:41,125
Patients have
scared you?

469
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:44,050
Only a little.

470
00:38:44,475 --> 00:38:47,675
This is normal, too they
scare me sometimes.

471
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:51,280
But I need to enter
the room of a patient

472
00:38:51,291 --> 00:38:53,510
apparently he had
an accident.

473
00:38:53,925 --> 00:38:56,425
Sure you prefer not to
clean the lower floors?

474
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:58,650
I think not.

475
00:38:59,575 --> 00:39:02,075
I know the lower floors and are
few places that are scary!

476
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,500
But you just
get used.

477
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:09,425
I can hear them talking
through the gates, and...

478
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:11,850
And that makes
me nervous.

479
00:39:12,575 --> 00:39:13,575
I know.

480
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,100
So I hear when
I'm there.

481
00:39:16,925 --> 00:39:18,525
But do not worry.

482
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,950
When you get used to
things they get easier.

483
00:40:03,475 --> 00:40:05,775
I can hear you
out there!

484
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,700
I've been talking to
your mother Lisa!

485
00:40:16,725 --> 00:40:19,025
She's here
with me Lisa!

486
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:23,950
She told me all
about you.

487
00:40:25,775 --> 00:40:28,975
I know you're out
there, Lisa!

488
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,500
Háblame.

489
00:40:33,025 --> 00:40:34,825
What do you
want me to say?

490
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:40,150
So you see you can tell me about
summer trips to Key West!

491
00:40:40,675 --> 00:40:42,275
With your mother.

492
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,100
Those are your favorite
memories with your mother!

493
00:40:54,525 --> 00:40:58,325
So you see you want to tell
me about how you were sad...

494
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:01,050
Next to the bed
of your mother...

495
00:41:01,175 --> 00:41:04,375
for 6 months long.

496
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,900
Taking care of
her unassisted.

497
00:41:09,325 --> 00:41:14,925
With cancer
ending his body.

498
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:18,150
Sucking all
his life.

499
00:41:21,975 --> 00:41:23,975
How do you
know all this?

500
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,400
Because your mother
is talking to me.

501
00:41:32,125 --> 00:41:34,125
You're a sick bitch.

502
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:36,150
She has a message
for you Lisa.

503
00:41:37,575 --> 00:41:39,575
A message!

504
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,600
What is it?

505
00:41:42,425 --> 00:41:44,425
¡Lárgate!

506
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,350
Lisa What's
going on?

507
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:53,176
I will not go back there, I
do not like being there.

508
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,001
Ok, calm down and tell
me what happened there?

509
00:42:55,025 --> 00:42:57,525
I said horrible things
out the door. Hideous!

510
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:59,550
She always tells
me too well.

511
00:42:59,775 --> 00:43:02,275
She said things that did not
have like to know about me.

512
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,300
- Like what?
- How...

513
00:43:07,125 --> 00:43:09,525
I'm crazy, right?
Do not.

514
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:12,650
This place gets
inside us sometimes.

515
00:43:12,875 --> 00:43:13,875
Is that...

516
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,200
I wonder if I'm
not going crazy.

517
00:43:16,425 --> 00:43:17,726
Well, it is
not healthy,

518
00:43:17,737 --> 00:43:20,735
think of all the crazy
things you're saying.

519
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:22,650
Trust me.

520
00:43:22,875 --> 00:43:24,875
Do not let come
into your head.

521
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,900
- It's hard to keep them out sometimes.
- Listen out...

522
00:43:29,225 --> 00:43:31,225
Take a break of
the lower floors.

523
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:33,850
I'll get there.

524
00:43:35,275 --> 00:43:36,775
I am sorry!

525
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,200
- I realized it would be so hard.
- Do not worry.

526
00:43:41,625 --> 00:43:44,425
The last thing I want is that you
feel threatened by having to work.

527
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:47,450
I appreciate it, I
really appreciate it.

528
00:43:49,075 --> 00:43:50,675
No problem.

529
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,300
That was all this
noise Palmer?

530
00:44:03,325 --> 00:44:06,325
Sorry to bother Mr. Pemberton,
but wanted to know if I can...

531
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:08,350
receive any medical
attention?

532
00:44:10,375 --> 00:44:12,375
How the hell did
this happen?

533
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:16,300
Well, I think it was this rudimentary
weapon which did the damage.

534
00:44:17,425 --> 00:44:19,025
Jesus Christ!

535
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:21,550
Put the gun down and
step away from the door!

536
00:44:22,775 --> 00:44:25,495
Put your hands on your fucking head
and stand against the wall, now!

537
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,100
I'm eating
your shit!

538
00:44:27,125 --> 00:44:30,825
One false move and cover
the walls with your brain.

539
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:33,850
You understand? As you
wish, Mr. Pemberton.

540
00:44:40,475 --> 00:44:42,275
And do not move!

541
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,300
Do not move a shit!

542
00:45:15,425 --> 00:45:17,425
Sorry Mr. Pemberton.

543
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:36,650
Good night, Mr.
Kimble.

544
00:45:56,775 --> 00:45:58,375
Pemberton?

545
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,241
Pemberton, where
the hell are you?

546
00:46:01,252 --> 00:46:02,852
Why are you
taking so long?

547
00:46:04,625 --> 00:46:06,325
Jesus, Mary
and Joseph!

548
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:18,550
Shit!

549
00:46:28,675 --> 00:46:31,275
We have a code 6
in the X Wing!

550
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,200
We have a job to do.

551
00:46:52,925 --> 00:46:54,625
So let's work!

552
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:05,250
Good night
gentlemen!

553
00:47:05,575 --> 00:47:08,775
I think we will have a
show here in the morning.

554
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,800
Bastardo!

555
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:04,925
What the fuck are
you looking at?

556
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:06,250
Nothing!

557
00:48:06,475 --> 00:48:08,575
I just heard something
and I was curious.

558
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,900
We ensure that it is
in the way it is.

559
00:48:13,925 --> 00:48:16,125
This guy is
a menace!

560
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:19,350
He deserves everything
that happened to him!

561
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:24,975
I look not want you talking
to Mixter about it!

562
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,600
Nor with
anyone else!

563
00:48:28,925 --> 00:48:31,325
You understand? -I
will not say anything.

564
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,550
Good!

565
00:48:35,475 --> 00:48:37,475
You do not have to
clean somewhere else?

566
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,900
My dear God, you
look like shit!

567
00:49:29,225 --> 00:49:31,225
Thank you, happens.

568
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:39,950
The nights
are long no!

569
00:49:40,575 --> 00:49:42,975
Yes, work is
beating me...

570
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,000
And making my internal
clock go crazy.

571
00:49:50,025 --> 00:49:52,025
But you know it's
not just that.

572
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:56,350
There's something really
wrong with this place.

573
00:49:56,475 --> 00:49:58,075
Like what?

574
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,200
Good...

575
00:50:00,625 --> 00:50:03,525
Virtually everyone
are idiots perfect!

576
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:06,150
Usually, there are
places like this!

577
00:50:06,175 --> 00:50:08,175
Patients are
very violent!

578
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,200
Some of them
you care?

579
00:50:10,425 --> 00:50:11,925
No, nothing
like that!

580
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:14,850
Are the things they say,
that can be, well...

581
00:50:16,775 --> 00:50:20,075
I do not know, this might just
seeing things that do not exist.

582
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,200
What are you
talking about?

583
00:50:23,625 --> 00:50:25,225
O...

584
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:30,850
Or this place is haunted
or I'm going crazy.

585
00:50:32,275 --> 00:50:34,275
I would not be surprised,
that he was bewitched.

586
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,400
What do you mean?

587
00:50:36,425 --> 00:50:38,425
I told my father
about your new job.

588
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:39,750
It's okay.

589
00:50:39,875 --> 00:50:42,875
You know that asylum was
built a few years ago?

590
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:43,800
Yes.

591
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:49,125
He said it was built
in 112 Ocean Avenue.

592
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:50,950
And with that?

593
00:50:51,275 --> 00:50:52,875
Have you not heard?

594
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,800
No!

595
00:50:54,925 --> 00:50:56,725
There was a
famous house!

596
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:58,750
Infamous, how
should I say...

597
00:50:59,275 --> 00:51:02,275
A man shot his entire
family in the 70s.

598
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:07,200
His parents, brothers, sisters, killed
his entire family with a shotgun!

599
00:51:07,725 --> 00:51:10,725
And the next owners of the
house, only lasted a month!

600
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:14,150
They said they were expelled from
the house by evil spirits...

601
00:51:14,175 --> 00:51:16,175
And the house became
famous in the whole world!

602
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,300
That's why the previous
owners sold the property.

603
00:51:19,625 --> 00:51:22,175
They tired of the constant
interest of the media,

604
00:51:22,186 --> 00:51:23,786
and tourists.

605
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:27,650
Are you sure you've never heard in
the house of horrors in Amityville?

606
00:51:27,675 --> 00:51:31,775
I mean, I remember vaguely
heard something...

607
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,100
But I've never delved
into the matter.

608
00:51:34,125 --> 00:51:36,425
I did not realize that
was on the grounds.

609
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:38,950
Yes, right in the place where
the house was demolished.

610
00:51:40,075 --> 00:51:41,775
And you think you
are bewitched!

611
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,900
Either that or
I'm going crazy.

612
00:51:47,125 --> 00:51:49,125
Well, we know
you're not crazy.

613
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:53,650
Maybe all the stories about
the haunted house, are true.

614
00:51:54,175 --> 00:51:56,775
Perhaps the house is
gone, but not spirits.

615
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:58,900
Do you believe
in ghosts?

616
00:52:00,225 --> 00:52:01,925
I've never seen one.

617
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:04,850
But I think I have
an open mind.

618
00:52:05,675 --> 00:52:08,000
Did not you say you
saw something, right?

619
00:52:08,011 --> 00:52:09,611
Thank you.

620
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:11,900
So, what will you
do? Give up?

621
00:52:13,425 --> 00:52:16,325
Part of me thinks
I should, why...

622
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:19,650
This place has many
things that scare me.

623
00:52:21,775 --> 00:52:23,975
But I think,
you know...

624
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,400
I've lived a lot.

625
00:52:28,225 --> 00:52:30,125
If I were you, I
would resign.

626
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:33,950
There is no way to work
in a place you chills.

627
00:52:35,275 --> 00:52:37,575
Yes but I really
need the money.

628
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:42,000
And now I think I feel I
should find out more...

629
00:52:42,925 --> 00:52:44,825
And get to the bottom
of the matter.

630
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:47,450
Maybe you've
gone mad!

631
00:52:49,175 --> 00:52:50,875
Yeah, maybe a
little crazy.

632
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,800
Your hair is crazy!

633
00:52:56,225 --> 00:52:57,825
Oh God!

634
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:06,250
6 MEMBERS OF
THEIR OWN FAMILY

635
00:53:12,975 --> 00:53:15,975
THE VICTIMS

636
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,300
Do you know the history
of this place?

637
00:53:39,725 --> 00:53:42,025
It does not have
much history...

638
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:45,150
We are open from
about two years ago.

639
00:53:45,575 --> 00:53:47,375
No, the history
of the land.

640
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,900
You mean to what was on the
ground before the hospital?

641
00:53:49,925 --> 00:53:51,525
Yes.

642
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:53,950
I know very
little about it.

643
00:53:54,675 --> 00:53:57,575
112 Ocean Avenue.

644
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,700
The old Amityville
haunted house!

645
00:54:00,725 --> 00:54:03,025
I do not know about
the spell, but...

646
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:04,950
I know what
that guy.

647
00:54:05,275 --> 00:54:07,275
The guy who killed
his family.

648
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:09,500
That's true.

649
00:54:10,025 --> 00:54:12,725
I just learned about it
through a friend recently.

650
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:15,850
It was a
famous case.

651
00:54:16,075 --> 00:54:17,875
Why did you
not tell me?

652
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:21,300
You looked so scared, I did not
want to make things worse.

653
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:24,225
You know why
I'm scared?

654
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:26,950
Yes, because patients
on the lower floors.

655
00:54:27,275 --> 00:54:29,075
Not only that
Delaney.

656
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,000
I believe...

657
00:54:33,725 --> 00:54:35,325
Have you seen
anything?

658
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:38,950
Do you remember that girl?
Which I saw in the hallway.

659
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:40,675
I know who is!

660
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:43,700
She is the daughter
of the DeFeo family.

661
00:54:44,025 --> 00:54:45,625
They killed her!

662
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:48,550
Have you ever
you seen?

663
00:54:50,075 --> 00:54:51,675
No.

664
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,500
Honestly? I can
be honest Lisa?

665
00:54:56,025 --> 00:54:58,125
I do not believe in that
stuff about ghosts.

666
00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:03,450
I do not think so, but.
I know what I saw.

667
00:55:03,575 --> 00:55:06,175
Look, I think you
saw something.

668
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:09,000
Some people are not open
to this sort of thing.

669
00:55:09,025 --> 00:55:10,525
But OK...

670
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:13,050
I'm not very
attached to that.

671
00:55:13,775 --> 00:55:15,575
So what do
you think?

672
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,500
Believe in God?

673
00:55:17,625 --> 00:55:19,625
You're making serious
questions this evening Lisa.

674
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:21,250
I'm curious.

675
00:55:22,175 --> 00:55:23,875
Why do you ask?

676
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,200
I've been
thinking...

677
00:55:26,925 --> 00:55:27,825
You know...

678
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:31,250
how much evil can
exist in the world...

679
00:55:31,575 --> 00:55:33,175
Which we can be...

680
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:36,100
Protected by a
loving God.

681
00:55:37,025 --> 00:55:38,625
Look...

682
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:43,850
I do not believe that God is a
bearded man, who lives in Heaven.

683
00:55:43,975 --> 00:55:47,375
Like I do not think that the
devil is a devil with red horns.

684
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:50,500
I think... God
and Satan...

685
00:55:50,925 --> 00:55:52,725
They live in
each of us.

686
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:57,150
They are good
or bad...

687
00:55:57,575 --> 00:55:59,175
That depends Lisa...

688
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,900
Which side
we belong!

689
00:56:02,825 --> 00:56:04,825
What scares me...

690
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:08,450
What if there
is a God...

691
00:56:09,075 --> 00:56:11,275
But it is not
powerful enough...

692
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,400
To stop the evil.

693
00:56:15,225 --> 00:56:17,006
Free will is in the
hands of people.

694
00:56:17,017 --> 00:56:18,657
They are feeding the
evil within them...

695
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:21,450
That's what
scares me.

696
00:56:24,975 --> 00:56:27,869
Dr. Mixter had to know
what was in this area,

697
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,480
before edify.

698
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:32,100
Of course he knew.

699
00:56:32,125 --> 00:56:34,925
Even it was he who bought the
land and made the demolition.

700
00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:39,450
Why would I do that
knowing the story?

701
00:56:39,775 --> 00:56:41,775
Maybe he is not
superstitious, is a doctor!

702
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:44,200
Usually they do not
believe in these things.

703
00:56:45,725 --> 00:56:50,025
Amityville is full of legends,
even before the Defeos.

704
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:53,450
Like what?

705
00:56:54,375 --> 00:56:57,825
As the stories of Native
Americans being slaughtered

706
00:56:57,836 --> 00:56:58,985
in these lands...

707
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,000
Many years ago.

708
00:57:01,925 --> 00:57:03,225
Some people...

709
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:06,150
believe that even the
head of the Indians...

710
00:57:06,575 --> 00:57:08,175
that boy possessed.

711
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,200
The guy who killed
his family.

712
00:57:10,725 --> 00:57:12,725
- Really?
- Yes.

713
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:15,550
I do not think
that's true.

714
00:57:16,075 --> 00:57:19,075
If there's anything I learned from
patients in the lower floors...

715
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,744
It is that the minds
of some people,

716
00:57:20,755 --> 00:57:22,710
It works differently from
the minds of others.

717
00:57:23,725 --> 00:57:26,325
People who do Lisa,
good bad things...

718
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:30,050
They feed the evil within
them, and that's not good.

719
00:57:30,575 --> 00:57:32,375
Possession.

720
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:34,700
It is a disease.

721
00:57:35,425 --> 00:57:37,025
Sickness of
the soul.

722
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:41,650
I do not know
what to believe.

723
00:57:42,475 --> 00:57:45,075
Just do not let your
imagination take you Lisa.

724
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:49,400
Look, you're a girl
you have food in you.

725
00:57:50,825 --> 00:57:52,825
Do not let this place
put evil in you.

726
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:55,450
Ok?

727
00:57:56,275 --> 00:57:57,875
If it is okay.

728
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,101
The librarian seemed
to know much...

729
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:12,610
about Native Americans
in Amityville.

730
00:58:13,125 --> 00:58:15,725
Yes, but I knew nothing about
someone who killed on the ground.

731
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:18,250
The librarian said that the
whole city was very angry...

732
00:58:18,275 --> 00:58:20,475
When the Psychiatric Hospital
was built on the ground.

733
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,801
Why they did not want something
threatening in the neighborhood...

734
00:58:22,825 --> 00:58:25,025
and they signed a petition
with thousands of names.

735
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:26,650
But the doctor who
runs the place...

736
00:58:26,675 --> 00:58:29,275
I had a lot of money and
bribing important people.

737
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,900
But it is true that
there were dead or not?

738
00:58:33,425 --> 00:58:35,425
You are here...
Here it is.

739
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:37,750
In the 18th
century...

740
00:58:37,775 --> 00:58:40,610
There was a Native American
tribe in Amityville,

741
00:58:40,621 --> 00:58:41,985
known as the Sachem.

742
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,160
Led by Sachem
Takapoucha as chief.

743
00:58:44,985 --> 00:58:46,763
The tribe migrated from
Salem to Massachusetts

744
00:58:46,774 --> 00:58:48,595
to escape Christian
persecution.

745
00:58:48,610 --> 00:58:52,410
They were persecuted for being
considered practitioners of witchcraft.

746
00:58:52,835 --> 00:58:56,835
They made a ritual of human
sacrifice to 6 people.

747
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:00,960
6 For it relates to the biblical
number, man and creation.

748
00:59:01,285 --> 00:59:03,885
In order to invoke the
spirit of their God.

749
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:06,310
"Master of
darkness".

750
00:59:06,335 --> 00:59:10,935
What believed that empowered
his followers immortality.

751
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:13,177
Many settled
in Amityville,

752
00:59:13,188 --> 00:59:15,170
but later they were
expelled from the land...

753
00:59:15,185 --> 00:59:16,785
By local Christians.

754
00:59:16,810 --> 00:59:20,810
Some Christians wanted to expel
the tribes of their lands.

755
00:59:21,035 --> 00:59:22,535
A war began.

756
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:25,760
The cristianes hired
John Underhill salem.

757
00:59:26,285 --> 00:59:27,426
A collective
cemetery,

758
00:59:27,437 --> 00:59:30,195
Built in 112 Ocean
Avenue in Amityville.

759
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:32,510
Underhill killed
the whole tribe.

760
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:35,335
The Indians were massacred
and buried in the ground.

761
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:38,460
Before dying, Sachem
vowed revenge.

762
00:59:38,885 --> 00:59:41,544
According to a local
legend, the chief Sachem,

763
00:59:41,555 --> 00:59:43,695
still she is
bewitching land.

764
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:48,710
Parapsychologists and psychics claim
that the vengeful spirits of Sachem...

765
00:59:48,935 --> 00:59:51,689
influenced the 1974 murder
of the DeFeo family

766
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:53,300
on Ocean Avenue 112.

767
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,660
And they freaked all
owners who followed.

768
00:59:55,685 --> 00:59:57,985
As revenge for
the lives taken.

769
00:59:59,110 --> 01:00:02,510
So the legend is based
on historical facts?

770
01:00:02,535 --> 01:00:04,135
It seems like!

771
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:20,860
You told me
last night.

772
01:00:21,385 --> 01:00:23,485
What evil lives
in all of us.

773
01:00:25,610 --> 01:00:28,410
You may... People can
be influenced...

774
01:00:28,735 --> 01:00:31,435
for the evil
of them?

775
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:33,360
Why are you still
thinking about it?

776
01:00:33,385 --> 01:00:34,885
Yes, I follow.

777
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:38,110
So you're thinking too much.
This place is coming to you.

778
01:00:38,435 --> 01:00:41,435
It's coming to me for something
sinister what is happening.

779
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:45,460
And not only by
patients Wing X.

780
01:00:46,285 --> 01:00:47,985
Have you ever
noticed that?

781
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:54,410
I could have
noticed something.

782
01:00:56,735 --> 01:00:59,235
Why then you never say
anything, or did nothing?

783
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:05,160
This is like a bee.

784
01:01:06,985 --> 01:01:08,585
What does that mean?

785
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:15,610
While the bee is flying
from flower to flower.

786
01:01:17,535 --> 01:01:19,535
But when you think
something is a threat.

787
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,160
Pica!

788
01:01:23,885 --> 01:01:25,485
You can leave
a mark...

789
01:01:26,510 --> 01:01:28,110
but the person
recovers.

790
01:01:29,635 --> 01:01:31,235
But bee...

791
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:35,060
Go dead!

792
01:01:36,685 --> 01:01:38,285
So I wonder.

793
01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:42,610
It was worth it?

794
01:01:54,735 --> 01:01:57,135
Take a look at this article!
What does it say there?

795
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:58,835
The Sachem tribe,

796
01:01:58,846 --> 01:02:02,070
It was a Native American tribe
that existed in the 18th century.

797
01:02:02,285 --> 01:02:05,485
They migrated from Massachusetts to
Amityville, where they were killed...

798
01:02:05,510 --> 01:02:06,910
in a dispute
over land.

799
01:02:06,935 --> 01:02:09,255
The tribe was known for being
practitioners of witchcraft.

800
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:11,741
And they worshiped a god called
the "master of darkness."

801
01:02:11,985 --> 01:02:16,185
In 2009, a modern cult emerged in
honor of the tribe that existed.

802
01:02:16,710 --> 01:02:18,510
They adopted the beliefs
of the tribe ..

803
01:02:18,535 --> 01:02:21,226
But not the idea of ​​what it
takes to be Native American

804
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:22,837
to join the sect.

805
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:25,060
Click on that
final link.

806
01:02:25,085 --> 01:02:26,685
- This Here?
- Yes.

807
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:30,210
Our time is near.

808
01:02:30,235 --> 01:02:31,835
On November
13, 2013...

809
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:35,146
6 souls will be sacrificed
to the "master of darkness"

810
01:02:35,157 --> 01:02:36,770
by his devoted
followers.

811
01:02:36,985 --> 01:02:38,885
To be blessed
with immortality.

812
01:02:39,810 --> 01:02:42,210
Devotees do not perish
at the final judgment.

813
01:02:42,235 --> 01:02:44,535
But the faithful
followers of love.

814
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:48,560
They will survive and win great
power and responsibility.

815
01:02:48,585 --> 01:02:51,385
To rule the
new world.

816
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:53,410
What the fuck?

817
01:02:54,235 --> 01:02:55,935
Click on the
calendar.

818
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:01,560
- Get up!
- Why?

819
01:03:01,585 --> 01:03:03,585
What is this? What
does this mean Lisa?

820
01:03:06,510 --> 01:03:10,610
Sadie Krenwinkel, accused of
murder and cultist Sachem...

821
01:03:10,635 --> 01:03:13,335
A modern incarnation of the cult
of a tribe of Native Americans...

822
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:15,360
who practiced witchcraft
in the 18th century.

823
01:03:16,085 --> 01:03:19,885
At his trial in 2010 Krenwinkel told
police about the cult Sachem...

824
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:22,785
Alleging that the sacrifice
of 6 individuals,

825
01:03:22,796 --> 01:03:24,820
followers to give
immortality.

826
01:03:25,335 --> 01:03:27,635
- Oh my God!
- What?

827
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:31,960
Find the name of the doctor
who testified at the trial.

828
01:03:49,585 --> 01:03:51,185
Sadie!

829
01:03:52,610 --> 01:03:54,410
I know what
you're doing!

830
01:03:57,435 --> 01:03:59,135
There you blog!

831
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:02,260
How do you have
internet access?

832
01:04:11,085 --> 01:04:13,085
You are allowed to
have it in your cell?

833
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:16,310
"Master of
Darkness" is near.

834
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:21,235
Now it's too late
to try to stop it.

835
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:26,860
The night is waiting
for the big arrival.

836
01:04:28,485 --> 01:04:31,485
What are you planning? Are
you planning a sacrifice?

837
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:34,810
Good things come
of it, right?

838
01:04:41,935 --> 01:04:46,035
Our time is near.

839
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:05,160
Pass!

840
01:05:06,485 --> 01:05:08,085
Hola Dr. Mixter!

841
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:10,910
Hello lisa! What
can I do for you?

842
01:05:11,535 --> 01:05:13,835
I have to talk to
you. Something.

843
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:15,260
It's very important.

844
01:05:15,285 --> 01:05:16,885
Yes of course.

845
01:05:23,010 --> 01:05:25,010
So what I can do
for you Lisa?

846
01:05:26,335 --> 01:05:28,935
Well, I'll tell...

847
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:31,560
I can sound a little
weird, but...

848
01:05:31,985 --> 01:05:33,985
I really
need to say.

849
01:05:35,010 --> 01:05:36,610
Okay, go ahead.

850
01:05:36,835 --> 01:05:40,535
Are you aware of the history of
this place before the hospital?

851
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:42,960
A specifically
that mean?

852
01:05:44,585 --> 01:05:47,285
The murder of Defeos, the
house that was here...

853
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:49,110
what people say
is haunted.

854
01:05:49,535 --> 01:05:52,235
On the murder of
the DeFeo yes...

855
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:54,360
But haunted?

856
01:05:55,185 --> 01:05:57,985
That's just a scary thing
created by the media.

857
01:05:58,110 --> 01:06:01,710
But what about the history of
the land in the 18th century?

858
01:06:02,235 --> 01:06:04,235
No I do not know.

859
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,060
Good...

860
01:06:06,285 --> 01:06:09,085
There was a group of
Native Americans...

861
01:06:09,610 --> 01:06:11,210
Sachem called
the tribe...

862
01:06:11,535 --> 01:06:13,435
And they were
killed...

863
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:16,960
For Christians during the
dispute of the land...

864
01:06:18,185 --> 01:06:21,285
I'm sure all this
has a meaning.

865
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:23,010
Yes

866
01:06:23,035 --> 01:06:25,235
Sadie Krenwinkel,
ward X.

867
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:29,060
She shares the belief
of the tribe... Sachem.

868
01:06:30,285 --> 01:06:34,085
I have reason to believe that she
is having internet access...

869
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:37,110
And also, the whole paraphernalia
of Witchcraft and...

870
01:06:38,235 --> 01:06:41,135
He is planning some kind of
human sacrifice for tonight.

871
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:45,160
To invoke the God in whom they
believe. The master of darkness.

872
01:06:45,585 --> 01:06:47,085
I'm serious!

873
01:06:47,110 --> 01:06:49,110
He has been reading
about Sadie?

874
01:06:49,635 --> 01:06:51,935
All this nonsense?

875
01:06:53,060 --> 01:06:56,460
I can assure you, you do not
have internet access...

876
01:06:56,485 --> 01:06:58,185
and all he said.

877
01:06:59,310 --> 01:07:02,210
She has a blog, and sites
like "Sister Sadie".

878
01:07:02,535 --> 01:07:04,935
Sadie. That can
be anything else.

879
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:07,260
Check yourself!

880
01:07:10,785 --> 01:07:12,785
The patient
X room...

881
01:07:12,810 --> 01:07:15,810
They spend 23 hours a
day in those cells.

882
01:07:16,535 --> 01:07:19,935
Leave for an hour to exercise,
and they are closely watched...

883
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:22,560
For six of our
employees.

884
01:07:23,385 --> 01:07:26,077
There is no chance
that these patients

885
01:07:26,088 --> 01:07:27,595
Internet access...

886
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:29,210
The such
paraphernalia.

887
01:07:29,735 --> 01:07:32,635
Well, someone is helping
her to access...

888
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:34,660
Someone here.

889
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:38,385
Just go to your cell
and talk to her.

890
01:07:38,610 --> 01:07:40,310
If I'm wrong well.

891
01:07:40,635 --> 01:07:42,235
But he had to say.

892
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:44,460
And I need to
check it, please.

893
01:07:47,885 --> 01:07:49,485
Wait a minute.

894
01:07:50,810 --> 01:07:52,710
You were a witness
in his trial?

895
01:07:53,635 --> 01:07:55,335
Yes, I witnessed.

896
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:57,060
What is insinuating?

897
01:07:57,785 --> 01:07:59,785
So you know how
dangerous it is?

898
01:08:00,010 --> 01:08:01,610
Yes!

899
01:08:02,235 --> 01:08:04,235
And I appreciate
your concern.

900
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:08,560
One thing you need to
understand Lisa...

901
01:08:09,185 --> 01:08:13,085
There are very disturbed
patients in this hospital.

902
01:08:13,310 --> 01:08:15,310
We help those who
can be helped...

903
01:08:15,435 --> 01:08:17,835
But patients in X
room are beyond help.

904
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:22,260
Psychological disorders of
them are very advanced...

905
01:08:22,785 --> 01:08:24,485
They have
illusions...

906
01:08:24,810 --> 01:08:26,410
Of greatness, or...

907
01:08:27,235 --> 01:08:31,135
I'm worried about you that
you believe in illusions.

908
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:34,360
I know what this
may seem...

909
01:08:34,585 --> 01:08:36,185
But please!

910
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:38,010
Check your blog!

911
01:08:38,335 --> 01:08:41,535
You can access the home page,
from here in the hospital.

912
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:42,560
It's okay.

913
01:08:42,985 --> 01:08:46,485
You came with a complaint about
a violation of a patient...

914
01:08:46,510 --> 01:08:48,510
And a threat of
violence, so...

915
01:08:48,535 --> 01:08:50,535
My duty is to
investigate!

916
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:54,260
In fact I'll start a
search immediately.

917
01:08:54,485 --> 01:08:56,085
Stay there!

918
01:08:56,310 --> 01:08:58,510
I'll be right
back! -Thank you.

919
01:09:31,535 --> 01:09:33,535
What the hell
are you doing?

920
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:37,460
This is so that you
calm down Lisa.

921
01:09:39,485 --> 01:09:41,485
Fuck off!

922
01:09:44,610 --> 01:09:47,610
We are trying
to help.

923
01:10:10,035 --> 01:10:12,035
Let me out of here
fucking sick!

924
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:14,160
Let's talk
softly Lisa!

925
01:10:15,685 --> 01:10:18,185
Otherwise, you will
be sedated again.

926
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:23,610
Why do this?

927
01:10:23,635 --> 01:10:25,835
You're having
paranoid delusions.

928
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:29,460
And you're having
disturbing visions.

929
01:10:31,285 --> 01:10:33,685
I have no illusions,
I know what I saw.

930
01:10:33,710 --> 01:10:35,710
You think you know.

931
01:10:36,835 --> 01:10:39,335
The brain is
very powerful.

932
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:42,360
I'm sure you believe
what you saw.

933
01:10:43,285 --> 01:10:45,285
But all in
your head.

934
01:10:45,710 --> 01:10:47,310
That's not real.

935
01:10:48,635 --> 01:10:52,135
You're a sick girl, and
precise treatment.

936
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:57,060
This makes all
your employees?

937
01:10:57,885 --> 01:11:00,885
Every time someone says
something ends up in jail?

938
01:11:01,110 --> 01:11:02,710
Employee?

939
01:11:03,235 --> 01:11:06,235
He never worked
here Lisa.

940
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,560
You're a
patient here!

941
01:11:08,785 --> 01:11:10,885
You always were
a patient here!

942
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:16,110
He's lying, I
know what I am!

943
01:11:16,935 --> 01:11:18,935
Do not be
afraid dear.

944
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:22,560
You have always
been with us here.

945
01:11:22,785 --> 01:11:24,785
Initially not as
a patient but...

946
01:11:26,410 --> 01:11:30,310
But the time has come that're
a full-time resident.

947
01:11:33,335 --> 01:11:34,935
I know.

948
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:37,360
It's a lot
to digest.

949
01:11:38,085 --> 01:11:40,685
So I'll let you
think about it.

950
01:11:42,010 --> 01:11:44,810
We begin our
morning session.

951
01:11:47,235 --> 01:11:49,435
- Okay.
- Now...

952
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:53,560
What if we make you
feel more comfortable.

953
01:11:55,085 --> 01:11:56,085
Thank you.

954
01:11:56,510 --> 01:11:58,510
First you have
to take this.

955
01:12:00,135 --> 01:12:02,435
It will help
you sleep.

956
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:10,860
Good girl!

957
01:12:13,485 --> 01:12:15,585
Let's get this
over Lisa.

958
01:12:16,110 --> 01:12:17,710
Together!

959
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:21,435
I will release
the belt.

960
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:26,160
But remember, if you put
the belt violent again.

961
01:12:26,385 --> 01:12:27,985
Ok.

962
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:30,910
- ¿Esta This better?
- Yes.

963
01:12:33,735 --> 01:12:35,935
Get some rest now.

964
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:40,060
Tomorrow we will begin
the healing process.

965
01:12:58,485 --> 01:13:03,185
Our time is near.

966
01:13:03,210 --> 01:13:06,510
Our God commands.

967
01:13:06,635 --> 01:13:09,335
For its majesty.

968
01:13:10,060 --> 01:13:12,760
Come with us
to bless.

969
01:13:12,785 --> 01:13:14,885
Nothing else...

970
01:13:14,910 --> 01:13:21,210
In addition to
your offer, death.

971
01:13:22,035 --> 01:13:24,035
You gave life.

972
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:26,560
Mátalos!

973
01:13:26,585 --> 01:13:28,585
Kill them all!

974
01:13:41,510 --> 01:13:44,510
We did it!
Elliot did!

975
01:13:45,135 --> 01:13:47,135
Our time is near.

976
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:50,360
Immortality is ours!

977
01:14:41,085 --> 01:14:42,685
Lisa!

978
01:14:46,610 --> 01:14:48,610
We have to go fast!

979
01:15:15,135 --> 01:15:16,735
What?

980
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:19,660
Come on!

981
01:15:33,085 --> 01:15:35,485
Why do not you want
to play with me?

982
01:15:56,310 --> 01:15:58,310
You have to get
out of here!

983
01:15:59,835 --> 01:16:01,835
Someone comes
around with a gun.

984
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:09,860
My skin is
too tight.

985
01:16:10,185 --> 01:16:11,785
What?

986
01:17:08,210 --> 01:17:09,810
Come on hurry up!

987
01:17:14,235 --> 01:17:15,635
What?

988
01:17:15,660 --> 01:17:17,660
The key is stuck
in the damn door!

989
01:17:18,185 --> 01:17:19,785
Do something!

990
01:17:41,710 --> 01:17:43,310
It's okay!

991
01:17:45,935 --> 01:17:47,535
You will be fine!

992
01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:55,660
Do not go!

993
01:17:59,485 --> 01:18:01,485
Do not go!

994
01:19:56,810 --> 01:19:58,710
And now that?
Motherfucker!

995
01:20:44,035 --> 01:20:46,035
Raise your hands
fucking sick!

996
01:20:47,860 --> 01:20:50,560
I see you leave,
the formalities.

997
01:20:51,585 --> 01:20:53,185
Among Lisa!

998
01:20:56,510 --> 01:20:58,510
You still tells
me I'm crazy?

999
01:20:58,735 --> 01:21:01,135
It's all in my head?

1000
01:21:02,060 --> 01:21:04,760
Well, maybe yes.

1001
01:21:05,285 --> 01:21:06,685
Maybe not.

1002
01:21:06,710 --> 01:21:09,110
Do not get in my
head motherfucker!

1003
01:21:09,435 --> 01:21:11,335
I know who I am
and what I saw.

1004
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:13,260
You are
what's crazy!

1005
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:17,385
He is holding a gun pointing
to a reputable doctor.

1006
01:21:17,410 --> 01:21:19,510
Why do this? Why?

1007
01:21:19,535 --> 01:21:21,935
You're part of
something big to come.

1008
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:24,160
The arrival of the
master of the dark!

1009
01:21:24,185 --> 01:21:27,685
It will bring all his
power and immortality.

1010
01:21:27,710 --> 01:21:29,710
Do you really
believe that?

1011
01:21:30,435 --> 01:21:32,535
Because everything
seems stupid to me.

1012
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:35,360
You're Nobody, apart from
being a fundamentalist...

1013
01:21:35,385 --> 01:21:37,097
What killed
innocent people

1014
01:21:37,108 --> 01:21:40,295
just because he read a lot
of crap on the internet...

1015
01:21:40,310 --> 01:21:41,910
He will be
here soon...

1016
01:21:42,635 --> 01:21:46,535
Just another sacrifice
is all you need.

1017
01:21:46,660 --> 01:21:49,460
How would that be if
I'll blow your head?

1018
01:21:52,885 --> 01:21:54,685
What are you
laughing?

1019
01:21:56,410 --> 01:21:59,510
It's all working
as expected.

1020
01:21:59,835 --> 01:22:01,535
The police
are coming.

1021
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:03,460
I'll tell you
all this.

1022
01:22:03,485 --> 01:22:06,185
Everything about
his sick plan!

1023
01:22:07,810 --> 01:22:09,810
They lock him up and
throw away the key!

1024
01:22:09,835 --> 01:22:11,435
If you say so!

1025
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:14,760
Tell Lisa!

1026
01:22:15,085 --> 01:22:19,185
How do I know his mother
is burning in hell?

1027
01:22:19,210 --> 01:22:22,610
Shut up! Do not say anything about my mother,
she does not know anything about it.

1028
01:22:22,635 --> 01:22:26,235
I know sometimes you wonder why
you have not cried enough.

1029
01:22:26,860 --> 01:22:29,260
I know you feel
guilty for not...

1030
01:22:29,285 --> 01:22:32,285
He has done more for her
when she was alive.

1031
01:22:32,310 --> 01:22:35,110
Having lived your life
without worrying about it.

1032
01:22:35,135 --> 01:22:36,335
I worried about her.

1033
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:39,260
Let's face Lisa, you never
took care of your mother!

1034
01:22:39,285 --> 01:22:41,985
You never cared about
anyone besides yourself!

1035
01:22:42,010 --> 01:22:43,810
Shut up! Shut up!

1036
01:22:43,835 --> 01:22:47,635
It is burning in hell knowing
that cared about him.

1037
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:56,860
His mother was a
dirty whore Lisa!

1038
01:22:56,885 --> 01:22:59,085
And it is
paying in hell!

1039
01:22:59,310 --> 01:23:01,010
Fuck off!

1040
01:23:21,735 --> 01:23:23,335
Thanks Victoria!

1041
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:27,060
A year ago they survived a slaughter
in the High Hopes hospital.

1042
01:23:27,085 --> 01:23:28,471
When the cleaning
lady Lisa Templeton.

1043
01:23:28,482 --> 01:23:29,295
He ran with a
shotgun...

1044
01:23:29,310 --> 01:23:32,010
killing 6 people and
injuring many others.

1045
01:23:33,135 --> 01:23:35,803
Dr. Elliot Mixer, wrote
a new book called.

1046
01:23:35,814 --> 01:23:37,345
"High Hopes,
lost dreams."

1047
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:39,560
What he gives us his account
of that fateful night.

1048
01:23:39,585 --> 01:23:41,985
As described in the
mind of the murderer!

1049
01:23:42,310 --> 01:23:44,810
Dr. Mixter, Good morning!
Catalina Good morning!

1050
01:23:44,835 --> 01:23:46,735
- How is it going?
- Very well thanks!

1051
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:48,960
Dr. why not tell us a
little about the book?

1052
01:23:49,085 --> 01:23:52,585
Well, he describes every
moment of that night.

1053
01:23:53,210 --> 01:23:56,810
Of course it was a
horrible experience.

1054
01:23:57,335 --> 01:24:01,535
It was very difficult for me
to lose those feelings...

1055
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:04,360
What happened,
and I wrote it!

1056
01:24:04,385 --> 01:24:06,585
And how it affected
the hospital?

1057
01:24:07,010 --> 01:24:09,810
Well, we were
closed for long!

1058
01:24:10,135 --> 01:24:14,935
And I know many people in town
thought we should have closed.

1059
01:24:15,860 --> 01:24:17,860
But it never
crossed my mind.

1060
01:24:18,485 --> 01:24:21,785
People come for
a tragedy!

1061
01:24:21,910 --> 01:24:23,610
And my staff
and I...

1062
01:24:23,635 --> 01:24:26,835
I certainly approached
us from that incident!

1063
01:24:26,860 --> 01:24:28,860
Like many colleagues,
as friends!

1064
01:24:29,885 --> 01:24:33,385
This has made us a better
institution in my opinion.

1065
01:24:33,910 --> 01:24:36,410
And we're getting
stronger!

1066
01:24:36,835 --> 01:24:39,735
You. Mentioned that some people
wanted to close the place.

1067
01:24:40,060 --> 01:24:42,760
I knew I had some resistance
to open the institute...

1068
01:24:42,785 --> 01:24:47,485
It is having been built in the
place the infamous "home"

1069
01:24:47,610 --> 01:24:50,510
Ronald DeFeo Jr. When he
killed his family in the 70s.

1070
01:24:51,335 --> 01:24:55,035
The people of that time explored the case
according to their previous terms...

1071
01:24:55,060 --> 01:24:57,260
and now they face the
same kind of opinions.

1072
01:24:57,285 --> 01:24:59,085
Especially in the
last week...

1073
01:24:59,110 --> 01:25:01,510
by selling his book
rights to make a movie.

1074
01:25:01,535 --> 01:25:03,535
How do you respond
to those criticisms?

1075
01:25:04,860 --> 01:25:06,660
I heard the charges.

1076
01:25:07,185 --> 01:25:08,785
But you do not
understand Catherine?

1077
01:25:08,810 --> 01:25:12,010
I'm helping those
involved to move forward.

1078
01:25:13,035 --> 01:25:17,135
I proposed to some of the
victims as criminally insane.

1079
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:21,060
But he also had loyal
employees, who had families.

1080
01:25:21,385 --> 01:25:23,985
And I'm determined not to
let them into oblivion!

1081
01:25:24,810 --> 01:25:27,610
Each of these
officials...

1082
01:25:27,635 --> 01:25:29,935
It has its own
chapter in my book.

1083
01:25:30,260 --> 01:25:32,860
So if you read will
have a perfect image...

1084
01:25:32,985 --> 01:25:35,085
How the people
were wonderful.

1085
01:25:36,410 --> 01:25:38,110
I've said it
before, but...

1086
01:25:38,635 --> 01:25:41,174
All types of media,

1087
01:25:41,185 --> 01:25:43,545
newspapers, books,
television, movies...

1088
01:25:44,060 --> 01:25:46,060
They are a
preservation of life!

1089
01:25:46,785 --> 01:25:49,685
Our physical
bodies can die.

1090
01:25:49,810 --> 01:25:53,110
But our image will
survive, and be famous.

1091
01:25:56,035 --> 01:25:59,435
Prayer, work, our passion,
will be retained.

1092
01:26:00,260 --> 01:26:02,760
Thus our souls
be preserved.

1093
01:26:03,485 --> 01:26:06,485
In all these
forms of media.

1094
01:26:06,810 --> 01:26:08,610
We will become
unachievable.

1095
01:26:11,035 --> 01:26:12,635
Immortals!

1096
01:26:13,305 --> 01:27:13,848
