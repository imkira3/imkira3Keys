I'll be keeping
an eye out on you.

Hey, pig face!

166
00:08:53,443 --> 00:08:54,945
Fuck!

167
00:08:54,978 --> 00:08:56,146

I knew it was
just a matter of time

179
00:10:11,789 --> 00:10:13,924
Before you
came crawling back.

180
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,060
Cutie-pie.

Surprise.

183
00:10:29,973 --> 00:10:31,909
Fucking bitch!

184
00:10:45,856 --> 00:10:48,892
Ladies, I hope you excuse
the rough treatment,

185
00:10:48,926 --> 00:10:50,427
But time is money.

186

Mae-Lin Fong,

Then you turned
self-styled techno-anarchist,

Blew up what you
described at the trial

191
00:11:03,841 --> 00:11:06,443
As a "crooked
Wall Street bank."

Kathryn Morgan,
Marine-Corps-qualified scout sniper.

10 years for shooting up
your boyfriend's truck

While he and
his mistress were in it.

202
00:11:30,367 --> 00:11:31,334
Shocker.

203
00:11:31,368 --> 00:11:33,170
Not that great of a job.

204

You missed.

205
00:11:34,204 --> 00:11:35,973
If I wanted them dead,

206
00:11:36,006 --> 00:11:38,275
I would have
only needed two rounds.

207
00:11:38,308 --> 00:11:40,878
I was just teaching
that cheap bastard a lesson.

208

Cassandra Clay,
part of the pilot program

209
00:11:45,315 --> 00:11:47,484
To prove that women
can serve in combat.

210
00:11:47,517 --> 00:11:49,987
Ranger school, then Delta.

211
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:53,023
You were even given command
of your own little unit.

212
00:11:53,056 --> 00:11:55,325
A real old G.I. Jane...

213
00:11:57,327 --> 00:12:00,964
Until you lost half
your team in Afghanistan,

214
00:12:00,998 --> 00:12:02,099
Attacked your C.O.

215
00:12:02,132 --> 00:12:05,402
25 years
for nearly killing him.

216
00:12:05,435 --> 00:12:07,637
You broke his arm,

217
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:10,473
Broke his legs,
one in four places,

218
00:12:10,507 --> 00:12:13,944
Broke three ribs, which resulted
in puncturing his lung.

219
00:12:13,977 --> 00:12:16,246
You squashed
his eye socket.

220
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:18,949
Look, I can't take credit
for all of that.

221
00:12:18,982 --> 00:12:20,918
He was also hit by a truck.

222
00:12:20,951 --> 00:12:22,319
When you threw him into it.

223
00:12:22,352 --> 00:12:24,287
And then
at your court-martial,

224
00:12:24,321 --> 00:12:26,890
Not one peep of why.

225
00:12:26,924 --> 00:12:29,059
I couldn't recall.

I'm not gonna tell
your real name,

229
00:12:39,202 --> 00:12:41,671
Agency courtesy and all.

230
00:12:41,704 --> 00:12:44,207
That, and I'd crush
your fucking throat.

231
00:12:46,576 --> 00:12:49,112
You've seen
everybody's dirty laundry.

232
00:12:49,146 --> 00:12:51,381
I think it's time
they see yours.

233
00:12:51,414 --> 00:12:54,384
You see,
Raven was one of us.

234
00:12:54,417 --> 00:12:57,054
We taught her how
to seduce and kill,

235
00:12:57,087 --> 00:13:00,123
And she did it well, very well,

236
00:13:00,157 --> 00:13:04,061
Until she started moonlighting
as a hit woman for hire.

237
00:13:05,295 --> 00:13:06,930
Private sector
paid good.

238
00:13:06,964 --> 00:13:09,132
We might have
turned our backs on that,

239
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,168
But then you
killed one of ours.

240
00:13:11,201 --> 00:13:13,470
That paid even better.

241
00:13:13,503 --> 00:13:15,272
You're all pieces of shit...

242
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,609
But today you're
lucky pieces of shit,

243
00:13:19,642 --> 00:13:21,511
Because Uncle Sam
wants you.

244
00:13:21,544 --> 00:13:24,481
Uncle Sam must be really
fucking desperate.

245
00:13:24,514 --> 00:13:26,116
The President's daughter

246
00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:29,086
Was kidnapped
by an Amazonian she-bitch,

247
00:13:29,119 --> 00:13:31,488
And she has her hostage
in some castle

248
00:13:31,521 --> 00:13:33,590
In the backwoods
of Shit-hole-istan,

249
00:13:33,623 --> 00:13:36,459
And she wants us to prop her
up as new head of state.

250
00:13:36,493 --> 00:13:37,961
We're gonna tell her go to hell.

251
00:13:37,995 --> 00:13:40,563
First, we need
to get Elise back,

252
00:13:40,597 --> 00:13:43,166
So this is the reason I'm
putting this team together.

253
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,170
Kat, long-range
interdictions, communications.

254

Mei-Lin, explosives.

Clay, tactical training
and command.

257
00:13:55,545 --> 00:13:59,316
You get in, grab the girl,
get out. Simple.

258
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:04,021
Just the four of us?
No backup?

259
00:14:04,054 --> 00:14:05,622
Right.

260
00:14:05,655 --> 00:14:06,723
Simple.

261
00:14:06,756 --> 00:14:08,625
Sounds like a suicide mission.

262
00:14:08,658 --> 00:14:10,560
Well, that's why
we're sending in you four.

263
00:14:11,194 --> 00:14:12,996
Oh lovely.

264
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,097
What's the job pay?

265
00:14:15,232 --> 00:14:16,599
We've been authorized

266
00:14:16,633 --> 00:14:18,435
To give each of you
a full Presidential pardon.

267
00:14:20,203 --> 00:14:22,105
And even you, Raven,

268
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:25,542
With potential to be reinstated
in your previous positions.

269
00:14:25,575 --> 00:14:29,212
Of course, that's gonna depend
on the success of the mission.

270
00:14:29,246 --> 00:14:31,181
How does that sound, Captain?

271
00:14:31,214 --> 00:14:35,218
What happens
if we say no?

272
00:14:35,252 --> 00:14:37,354
Well, if you say no,

273
00:14:37,387 --> 00:14:39,089
Then you go back to your hole,

274
00:14:39,122 --> 00:14:40,690
And you serve
the maximum sentence.

275
00:14:40,723 --> 00:14:43,260
We might even put a few more
charges on top of that,

276
00:14:43,293 --> 00:14:46,229
Depending on how vindictive
the President feels

277
00:14:46,263 --> 00:14:49,099
When his daughter comes
home in several small packages.

278
00:14:52,102 --> 00:14:53,770
So what's it gonna be, ladies?

279
00:14:58,441 --> 00:14:59,642
When do we start?

280
00:15:01,244 --> 00:15:02,545
We already have.

May not be a state dinner,

But it's more than virtually
every resident here eats in a day.

You shouldn't waste it.

The United States
doesn't do any negotiations.

289

For the masses, no,

290
00:16:08,578 --> 00:16:10,113
But for you,

291
00:16:10,147 --> 00:16:13,583
The rules are different,

292
00:16:13,616 --> 00:16:16,419
And there's
virtually no price

293
00:16:16,453 --> 00:16:18,755
Your father wouldn't pay
to get you back.

294
00:16:18,788 --> 00:16:21,258
What makes you think
that he won't bomb you

Leave her. The brass wants to ask
her a few choice questions

Before they shove her

very cautious.

that truck comes back,

00:38:12,501 --> 00:38:14,670
Hi...

656
00:38:14,703 --> 00:38:19,908
These are about
as effective as
a couple of sparklers.

657
00:38:19,941 --> 00:38:23,178
What makes you think that I won't
torture them out of you?

658
00:38:23,211 --> 00:38:25,781
Oh, I know you would.

659
00:38:25,814 --> 00:38:29,050
I just... I don't know
if you've got the time.

00:38:30,118 --> 00:38:32,220
[Chuckles]

661
00:38:32,253 --> 00:38:34,222
Good.

662
00:38:34,255 --> 00:38:37,759
That's a difference
between men and women,

663
00:38:37,793 --> 00:38:40,629
Brains,
not thick-headed muscle.

664
00:38:40,662 --> 00:38:42,598
But I could keep pushing,

665
00:38:42,631 --> 00:38:45,767
Because I know
you'll flinch first.

666
00:38:45,801 --> 00:38:50,739
But it's so rare to meet
such industrious women...

667
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,074
So for right now,

668
00:38:53,108 --> 00:38:56,478
I think it's
more exciting if I, um,

669
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:58,013
Say, "Deal."

670
00:38:59,948 --> 00:39:01,449
Deal.

671
00:39:02,851 --> 00:39:06,488
Grigori, have the ICBM
taken to the airfield

672
00:39:06,522 --> 00:39:07,723
And loaded on the plane.

673
00:39:07,756 --> 00:39:09,190
I want it
ready to ship

674
00:39:09,224 --> 00:39:11,560
As soon as the funds
are wired. [Whistles]

Why don't you
and your associates come with me,

00:39:14,029 --> 00:39:17,566
And let's hammer out the details
of our arrangement.

677
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,234
Whoa! No.
Not you, kid.

678
00:39:19,267 --> 00:39:21,136
Sorry. You stay here.

00:39:21,169 --> 00:39:22,771
What?
That's fucking bullshit!

680
00:39:22,804 --> 00:39:24,139
Excuse me?
I told you about this truck!

681
00:39:24,172 --> 00:39:26,141
This was all my idea!

682
00:39:26,174 --> 00:39:29,911
Stealing my truck
was your idea?

683

What's your name, girl?

684
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,582
Lexi.

685
00:39:33,615 --> 00:39:37,519
Grigori, show Lexi
our gratitude.

686
00:39:49,998 --> 00:39:51,533

Cool.

Don't do it again.

00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:04,846
Oh, I almost forgot.

690
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,850
For being incompetent enough to be
foiled by a little girl's plans...

[Snaps fingers]

Come on.

00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:21,697
Why don't you make sure
Lexi gets home safe.

695
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:24,032
I was never big
on sightseeing, anyway.

So, what y'all do
for fun around here?

700

As you can see, your country's war
on terror has been excellent for us.

Suicide vests.

Ah-ah. Can't give away
trade secrets to a stranger.

Oh, just as well.

We're
business partners.

705

We use a sealed

Metal detectors

But they pay in cash,

712

So if the fools want 72 virgins
that bad, none of my concern.

in a sense,

want to control them,

It just really
pissed him off.

One day, he tasked us
with clearing

A cave complex

And we were looking
at a hundred fighters.

That was the beginning
of 14 hours of hell,

At the end of which I was one
of the lucky ones.

I only caught
two bullets.

794
00:46:36,237 --> 00:46:39,975
My C.O.
was intentionally
withholding Intel.

795

11 good men died

Because he couldn't stand
to see a woman in charge.

797
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:50,051
So when I got
out of the hospital,

798
00:46:50,085 --> 00:46:52,087
I put him in one.

799

Heh.

Your boss lady says we should
make ourselves at home.

I never liked
to drink alone.

the command of men.

806
00:47:39,567 --> 00:47:43,671
So tell me, how did
you earn yours?

807
00:47:43,704 --> 00:47:45,440
My father.

808
00:47:45,473 --> 00:47:50,311
He was a great
military leader,

809
00:47:50,345 --> 00:47:55,583
But he would never have given
me the power like he would a son,

810
00:47:55,616 --> 00:47:59,187
So I shot him in the eyes,
and I took it.

811
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:02,123
But then I realized

812
00:48:02,157 --> 00:48:05,793
Staying on top,
that's a challenge.

813
00:48:05,826 --> 00:48:07,428
Very true.

814
00:48:07,462 --> 00:48:10,365
Everyone wants
to steal your power,

815
00:48:10,398 --> 00:48:14,669
So I've learned
to distrust everyone.

816
00:48:15,803 --> 00:48:19,040
So forgive me

want to go home.

[Crying]

1154
01:15:42,448 --> 01:15:46,920
Elise,
how much would you give

1155
01:15:46,953 --> 01:15:49,422
To stop Ulrika from ever hurting
another woman?

1156
01:15:52,826 --> 01:15:54,027
Anything.

1157
01:16:01,067 --> 01:16:03,002
Everything.

1158
01:16:03,036 --> 01:16:04,971
Me, too.

1159
01:16:10,744 --> 01:16:12,078
Wait!

1160
01:16:14,013 --> 01:16:14,948
It's okay.

1161
01:16:16,282 --> 01:16:18,484
This isn't over!

1162
01:16:18,517 --> 01:16:20,153
Oh, you can count on it!

1163
01:16:52,819 --> 01:16:54,120
Get in!
Get in.

1164
01:16:58,224 --> 01:17:00,059
Shit!

1165
01:17:00,093 --> 01:17:01,494
You all right?

1166
01:17:01,527 --> 01:17:03,029
I'm okay,
but my rifle's not.

1167
01:17:03,062 --> 01:17:04,430
What the hell are
you waiting for?

1168
01:17:04,463 --> 01:17:05,965
Punch that shit!

1169
01:17:31,190 --> 01:17:33,392
Hey, Kitty-Kat, you gonna
sit there and admire the view,

1170
01:17:33,426 --> 01:17:35,061
Or you gonna shoot back?

1171
01:17:35,094 --> 01:17:36,495
My rifle's broken!

1172
01:17:36,529 --> 01:17:38,197
Maybe you should try
some evasive driving for once!

1173
01:17:39,332 --> 01:17:40,834
Stop your bickering, you two!

1174
01:17:42,268 --> 01:17:44,237
You want
evasive driving?

1175
01:17:44,270 --> 01:17:45,805
Hang on, bitches!

1176
01:17:51,244 --> 01:17:52,545
KAT: They got
a rocket launcher.

1177
01:17:52,578 --> 01:17:54,013
Okay, I've got
two rounds left.

1178
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:55,248
It's all on you.
No pressure.

1179
01:17:56,615 --> 01:17:57,817
Two rounds?
Yeah.

1180
01:17:57,851 --> 01:17:59,919
I thought
you never miss.

1181
01:17:59,953 --> 01:18:02,421
Well, with a 1911 from a moving
vehicle at a rocket launcher?

1182
01:18:04,090 --> 01:18:05,324
I believe in you.

1183
01:18:05,358 --> 01:18:07,060
Hold it steady!

Nice work.
I like that.

01:18:28,147 --> 01:18:30,116
Don't tell Mei-Lin,
but I was aiming for the driver.

1189
01:18:30,149 --> 01:18:32,485
I don't care.

1190
01:18:36,222 --> 01:18:38,224
Okay, we're stealing her plane.

1191
01:18:38,257 --> 01:18:40,126
Let's go home, ladies.

1192

You good?

1195
01:18:55,909 --> 01:18:57,543
Like an Asian chick
gives happy endings.

I like 'em big.
