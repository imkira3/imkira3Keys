<i>It's like this:</i>

4
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:30,904
<i>We live in claustrophobia.
A land of steel and concrete...</i>

5
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:34,033
<i>...trapped by dark waters.</i>

6
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,328
<i>There is no escape,
nor do we want it.</i>

7
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:43,375
<i>We've come to thrive on it
and each other.</i>

8
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:48,422
<i>You can't get the adrenaline pumping
without the terror, good people.</i>

9
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:51,759
<i>I love this town.</i>

10
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,347
<i>You've been listening to WGAZ...</i>

11
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:45,182
<i>...the electricity of Manhattan.</i>

12
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,769
<i>This request has gone
all the way out to Crystal Lake...</i>

13
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,771
<i>...and the senior class
of Lakeview High.</i>

14
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,356
- That's us.
- All right!

15
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:55,776
<i>They'll be graduating on
the 13th of this month...</i>

16
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:58,820
<i>......and we wish them the best
of luck and success...</i>

17
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:02,491
<i>...when they come to visit
our seductive city.</i>

18
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,619
<i>Our lure is a great one,
young friends, but beware.</i>

19
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:11,541
<i>The city of lights
casts many shadows indeed.</i>

20
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:16,255
- I love you.
- I love you.

21
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:41,863
- Gotta throw the anchor over.
- Okay.

22
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:08,098
- Hey, what's wrong?
- Nothing.

23
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,851
Come on, Jimmy,
something's bothering you.

24
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,564
Just that we're right around
that summer camp...

25
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,899
...where all those murders
took place.

26
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:22,237
- What murders?
- You don't wanna know about it.

27
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,408
- Tell me.
- Forget about it, Suzi.

28
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,870
The guy's dead now.
Somewhere at the bottom of this lake...

29
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,247
...if you believe the stories.

30
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,374
What stories?

31
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,588
There was this boy
named Jason Voorhees.

32
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,798
<i>He drowned in Crystal Lake
about 30 years ago.</i>

33
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:46,136
None of the counselors heard him.

34
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,138
Help!

35
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:51,433
<i>A bunch of years went by,
and everyone forgot about it.</i>

36
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,394
And that's when the murders
started to happen.

37
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:57,397
Jason did it?

38
00:05:57,565 --> 00:06:01,193
His mother blamed the counselors
for her son's death...

39
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:06,823
...and she tried to kill them all, but she got
her head chopped off by one of them.

40
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:13,497
<i>Legend has it that Jason came back
to get even...</i>

41
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:17,459
<i>...vowing to kill every teenager
in the area.</i>

42
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:22,589
<i>And every now and then,
the murders just start up.</i>

43
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,636
Forget about it, Suzi,
they're just stories.

44
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,841
Did you hear that?

45
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:10,011
- Hear what?
- Come on, I'm serious.

46
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:14,683
All right. I'll go check it out.

47
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,413
Jim?

48
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:39,583
Jimmy?

49
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:59,978
Stop screwing around, Jim.
I mean it.

50
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,762
Got you good, Suzi.

51
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:42,145
All right, all right,
so I'm a major ass.

52
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:46,191
- And you'll never do it again?
- And I'll never do it again.

53
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:50,946
- Come on, forgive me?
- No, heh.

54
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,746
Jason?

55
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:13,630
No. No, please, no!

56
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:17,384
No. No. No, please, no!

57
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:21,638
No! No! No!

58
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,265
No! No!

59
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:58,133
Well, Toby's been awful quiet
back there.

60
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,635
Yeah, I guess he's a little
nervous about the trip.

61
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,433
Here.

62
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,482
Go on, open it.

63
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:21,156
Stephen King supposedly used it
in high school.

64
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:25,243
I don't know what to say.

65
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:31,166
Rennie, you are the best student
I have ever had.

66
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,877
You have a real gift.

67
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:37,964
And if there's anybody that can
make use of that pen, it's you.

68
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,190
Hi!

69
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,871
- Hello, Charles.
- Colleen.

70
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,791
You know, this cruise was your idea.
So at the very least...

71
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,084
...you could show up on time.

72
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,379
- Has everyone checked in?
- No.

73
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:21,674
Jim Miller and Suzi Donaldson
never showed up...

74
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,760
...and I'm more than a little concerned.

75
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,763
Well, don't be. They probably
decided to explore each other...

76
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,348
...rather than New York, heh.

77
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:32,560
Oh, that's nice. We're running
five minutes late already.

78
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:35,855
There's someone else coming too.

79
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,339
You never should have
brought her here.

80
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,884
It's up to Rennie to decide
what she wants to do.

81
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,553
She doesn't know what she wants.

82
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,639
She never had a stable life
till she came to live with me.

83
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,141
And she certainly doesn't
have one now either.

84
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:15,270
I'm her legal guardian,
not you or anybody else.

85
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:19,065
And I know what's best for her.
End of discussion.

86
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:23,069
No, I think it's just the beginning.

87
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,869
Have you decided on your
departure protocol, admiral?

88
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:34,038
Actually, I thought
I'd leave that honor to my son.

89
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,002
- Dad, I don't think that's necessary.
- Relinquishing command...

90
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:42,797
...of the motor vessel Lazarus
to Captain Sean Robertson.

91
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:50,138
But, uh, before you take the helm,
take this.

92
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,857
Something old and something new.

93
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,610
I used that sextant
when I was your age.

94
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:06,821
Now they got those goddamn
computers that do all the work for you.

95
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:10,158
Have you decided on
a plan of departure, captain?

96
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,296
Okay.

97
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,884
How about we, uh, start up the engines
and come around 180 degrees?

98
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,721
Aren't you forgetting something, mister?

99
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:35,808
Um....

100
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:46,361
Send out the international
maritime signal.

101
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:49,030
Followed by a security broadcast
warning other ships...

102
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,865
...that we are underway.

103
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,603
This voyage is doomed.

104
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:24,065
Heh. Yeah, tell me about it.

105
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,657
Bye!

106
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,537
- Have fun in New York!
- Bye!

107
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:23,791
- Rennie.
- Hi, Sean.

108
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:29,088
I heard you weren't coming.

109
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,132
We changed our minds.

110
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:41,809
- I got you a present.
- But I didn't get you one.

111
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:45,980
Forget it.
It's a dumb little thing anyway.

112
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,653
Sean, I love it.

113
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,786
You see,
I thought when we got there...

114
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:02,663
...maybe we could hike
to the top of the statue...

115
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,832
...if you felt like it.

116
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,669
It's supposed to be 22 stories tall.

117
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,881
That sounds wonderful.

118
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:16,844
Mr. Robertson.
Your father was looking for you.

119
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,140
I guess I'll see you later.

120
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:30,691
What are you doing here?
We've already been through all of this.

121
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:34,946
I'm sorry, Uncle Charles.
Please don't be upset with me.

122
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,698
I'm not upset, I'm just...

123
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,367
...concerned.

124
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,729
Is this ax awesome or what?

125
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:21,284
Too cool, J.J.
Your parents really came through.

126
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:22,869
- Heh, no lie.
- Heh.

127
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:25,371
Hey, I hear there's this big
power room downstairs.

128
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,748
We can get supreme concert-hall echo.

129
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,418
So come on down and shoot
a basement tape on me, okay?

130
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:34,589
Yeah. But I gotta get some
"shockumentary" footage first.

131
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:38,176
Heh, oh, man. Don't tell me you're still
trying to scam on Tamara.

132
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,891
How long have we
known each other?

133
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,101
Don't be a dweeb, Wayne.

134
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:50,646
She's not interested in you,
only what you can do for her.

135
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:55,401
- She is a user.
- She's sexy.

136
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,404
So what? So is this guitar.

137
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,908
Yeah. Well, I'll talk to you later,
all right?

138
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:26,265
There's a big storm
predicted for tonight.

139
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,977
Rennie, you're making a big mistake.

140
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:34,315
It's not too late
to put you back onshore.

141
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:37,610
If Miss Van Deusen
knew how afraid you were of....

142
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,363
She didn't push me into this.

143
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,243
Why are you doing this to yourself?

144
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:49,163
I don't even know what I'm afraid of,
Uncle Charles.

145
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,375
I can't even remember when it started.

146
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:56,254
Don't you think it's time I found out
and got over it?

147
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,885
Facing your fear
doesn't always conquer it.

148
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,432
I'm staying.

149
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,689
Okay.

150
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:20,861
Ah, man, this place
is aching for a video!

151
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,865
Wayne, you're an asshole.

152
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,516
So, what do you think?

153
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:35,519
Time for some personal experiences
to fuel our minds?

154
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,068
I agree.

155
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:24,860
<i>Mommy?</i>

156
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:56,392
Help! Help me!

157
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,896
Help!

158
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:06,026
Toby!

159
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:28,757
Is that a muscular bod or what?

160
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,733
One more, one more!

161
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,915
He's undefeated, you know that?

162
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:06,253
Julius is the only senior
I'd even consider doing it with.

163
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:09,048
- He is so good-looking.
- Heh.

164
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:14,595
Gorgeous guy at ten o'clock.
Look sensual.

165
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:34,114
I think it's time for some
recreational activity, girl.

166
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,706
Have you seen my niece anywhere?

167
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,501
Uh, yeah, I think she's motivating
downstairs, Mr. McCulloch.

168
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:46,752
Uh, what's the problem?

169
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,296
Well, senior predictions
started five minutes ago...

170
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:50,923
...and she hasn't shown up yet.

171
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:54,343
Oh, well, uh, maybe some of us
don't want our futures predicted.

172
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:57,805
Heh, well, in your case,
I'm sure that's true.

173
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:05,145
Nighttime is the right time.

174
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,405
No, thanks.

175
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:17,533
Don't be a lightweight.
This is top-dollar toot.

176
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:18,742
It's not that. It's just, you know...

177
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:22,162
...if we get caught, I could lose my
science scholarship and everything.

178
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,123
You're talking to the prom queen, Eva.

179
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,834
Do you really think I'm gonna risk
getting caught?

180
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,180
- Jesus!
- Have you guys seen my dog?

181
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,016
I think he came this way.

182
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:46,979
No, we haven't.
Did you care for a hit?

183
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:49,898
No, thanks.

184
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:56,363
Real space cadet.
I wonder if she'll narc on us.

185
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,704
Here, boy!

186
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:42,368
Oh, yeah. Ready to party
and then some.

187
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:50,918
- What are you doing in here?
- Nothing.

188
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:55,589
Are you girls using drugs?

189
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:58,967
Do you think I would use drugs,
Mr. McCulloch?

190
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:01,553
We were just exploring the ship.

191
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:10,020
I'll be coming around to your stateroom
in exactly 15 minutes, Miss Mason...

192
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:15,025
...so you better have your biology project
ready, or I'll be phoning your parents.

193
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,611
They're out of town.

194
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:22,700
Uh-huh, well, uh, I'll make sure
that you remain onboard...

195
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:27,287
...while your classmates
are out seeing the sights.

196
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:37,047
- Now what?
- Relax.

197
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:39,633
I've got McCulloch covered.

198
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:44,596
That narc'ing bitch niece of his
is a different matter.

199
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:48,183
Rumor has it she's a teensy bit
afraid of the water.

200
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:41,361
Nice fight, Julius. Guess I need
to work on my left-right-left combo.

201
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:48,368
Hey, listen.
No hard feelings, man, okay?

202
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:51,371
What do you say we track down
those babes later?

203
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,339
Julius?

204
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:26,740
- So are you having fun yet?
- Yeah, a lot.

205
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:29,618
Heh. Uh-huh.

206
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,663
Come on, level with me.

207
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:39,086
Hey, if you can't trust me,
who can you trust?

208
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:48,887
It was an accident, I swear.

209
00:30:57,647 --> 00:31:00,691
Stay calm and grab
the life preserver, Rennie!

210
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:39,646
I've got you. Come on. I've got you.

211
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:43,734
- That was truly excellent, heh.
- Yeah.

212
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,694
Come on.
Time to check out the waiters.

213
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,946
Look, I think I'll pass, okay?

214
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:50,908
- What?
- I'll see you later.

215
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,702
Heh. Some friend you are.

216
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:57,122
- Come on, grab her hand!
- That was close.

217
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:03,337
It's okay. It's okay. Come here.
Come here. Sit down. Sit down.

218
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:06,131
- Grab her some towels, okay?
- Okay.

219
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:11,386
She's fine. She's-- Just go back to
what you were doing, okay? Everybody.

220
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,682
Care to talk about it?

221
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,811
I can't swim.

222
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,940
No kidding.

223
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,443
You ever thought about taking lessons?

224
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,528
It's not that simple.

225
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:32,074
Good God!

226
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:35,869
- Take it easy, Charles. She's all right.
- Oh, I can see that.

227
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:39,414
You've done a wonderful job supervising
the kids. What the hell happened?

228
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:43,543
- It wasn't her fault.
- Give me those towels.

229
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:47,589
You stay away from her. Both of you!

230
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:54,554
He's come back,
and you're all gonna die.

231
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:57,933
Just leave me alone!

232
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:36,805
Help me! Help me!

233
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,074
The door's open.

234
00:33:57,493 --> 00:34:00,954
I'm in no mood for any more
of your stall tactics, Miss Mason.

235
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:04,124
Where is your final project?

236
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:11,298
Wouldn't you like
a glass of champagne first, Charles?

237
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,800
Where did you get this?

238
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:15,761
Why, I packed it...

239
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:17,637
...just for us.

240
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,473
Well, that's it.

241
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:23,435
You're not, uh, stepping off this ship
until we return home.

242
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:28,315
But I haven't even shown you
my biology project.

243
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,114
Hey....

244
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:41,203
What do you think you're doing?

245
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,748
I mean....

246
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,876
Now, you stop that!

247
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:54,049
I mean, really.

248
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:57,302
Take a closer look, Charles.

249
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:02,682
I wanna make sure I've labeled
all my organs correctly.

250
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:23,829
Get-- Get off of me!
I don't believe this.

251
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:28,416
What do you think you're--?
I'm your teacher, young lady.

252
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,295
Well, now you've gone and done it.
Not only are you going home...

253
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,673
...but I will-- I will see to it personally...

254
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:38,343
...that you spend next year
back in a high-school classroom.

255
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,393
What is going on here?

256
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,854
- Did you get anything good?
- Oh, yeah. Very kinky.

257
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:52,732
- Give me that tape. Give it to me!
- Come and get it.

258
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:57,737
You're going to be very,
very sorry, young lady.

259
00:35:57,905 --> 00:36:02,784
And as for you, you can forget
about attending any film school.

260
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:04,911
Ever!

261
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:12,919
Relax, Wayne, he's not
gonna risk trying a thing.

262
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:17,048
Yeah. Yeah, I guess you're right.

263
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:25,098
Listen, uh, this is gonna sound
supremely lame, and I know it...

264
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:30,562
...but, um, I've had the major hots for you
since our sophomore year, Tamara.

265
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:41,072
That's so sweet, Wayne.

266
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,618
And I really would love
to stay and chat...

267
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:46,620
...but I really am pressed for time.

268
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:49,372
So let's be sure to get together later.
Okey-doke?

269
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,916
- Yeah, I just thought---
- Yeah.

270
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,375
But I-- Maybe we could--

271
00:36:56,172 --> 00:37:00,800
Wayne, you're an asshole.

272
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:42,402
Oh, no! No!

273
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,738
No!

274
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:57,334
No! No, no!

275
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:16,978
Let's kick in the stabilizers, Mr. Carlson.
Keep the seas off the quarter.

276
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:18,480
Yes, sir.

277
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:22,025
These kids are in
for one hell of a storm.

278
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:40,752
- How old is your boy now, Carlson?
- Nineteen months.

279
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:44,464
Tremendous age.

280
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:50,303
Take some advice.
Don't push him too hard.

281
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:53,348
Yeah.

282
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:59,312
- Take the helm, would you, Jim?
- Certainly, sir.

283
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:41,604
I double-checked those
lifeboat stations too, Carl....

284
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:44,482
Oh, my God!

285
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:16,639
- Can he really take us home?
- He can call the Coast Guard cutter for you.

286
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:19,726
What about you? Are you staying here?

287
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:24,856
I'm never gonna be
what he wants me to be...

288
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:28,026
...so I guess I'm going with you.

289
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,622
Oh, Jesus!

290
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,625
Dad?

291
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,175
- Oh, God! Oh, God!
- No.

292
00:41:57,389 --> 00:42:00,225
<i>Attention, everybody. Attention.</i>

293
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:02,143
<i>This is Sean Robertson.</i>

294
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:03,561
Miles, you seen J.J.?

295
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:06,648
- She's supposed to be jamming down--
- Shh.

296
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:12,195
<i>Uh-- This is an emergency.
I want you all to come to the bridge.</i>

297
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,030
What the fuck is this?

298
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,868
Mayday.

299
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:20,912
Mayday.

300
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:23,998
Mayday!

301
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,750
Shit.

302
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,379
This is the motor vessel Lazarus.

303
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:32,757
Sean, what's going on?

304
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,593
Jesus Christ.

305
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:38,346
Please, can anybody out there
hear me?

306
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,598
<i>This is the
Coast Guard cutter Dallas.</i>

307
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:43,643
<i>What's the nature
of your problem, Lazarus?</i>

308
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,395
Thank God.

309
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,317
Hello?

310
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:58,283
- Hello, are you there?
- I demand to know what is going on!

311
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:01,286
Christ.

312
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:06,958
Sean, I'm....

313
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:12,088
Where's the radio?

314
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,049
It's dead.

315
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:19,470
You're all gonna die.

316
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:24,642
You're the last ones.
He's come back for you.

317
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:28,313
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Jason Voorhees.

318
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,567
You're insane! Jason Voorhees
has been dead for years.

319
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:36,237
He came down the river,
and he's gotten onboard.

320
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:39,073
He walks this ship here and now.

321
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:43,620
Yes, a killer walks this ship, all right.
And it's certainly none of us!

322
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,913
- You bastard!
- What are--? What are you doing?

323
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:48,750
You're the one who's insane.

324
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:54,255
That lunatic has been spouting off
about Jason...

325
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:56,132
...ever since he came aboard.

326
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:00,261
- And it's no coincidence.
- Doesn't prove he's the one.

327
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:03,389
Walking corpses are not real.

328
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:08,895
Oh, yeah? Yeah, well, these dead
bodies are sure enough real, all right?

329
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:11,981
Now, I say we regroup...

330
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:15,693
...and let's go find this motherfucker
before he finds us, huh?

331
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:18,321
- Are you with me?
- Watch your mouth, young man!

332
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:21,449
And you'll do no such thing.
I'm in charge here!

333
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:29,332
Ah, school is out, McCulloch. Okay?

334
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:34,295
Let's go.

335
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:38,800
You come back here!

336
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:47,767
Christ. Where's Rennie?

337
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:52,939
She's dropping the anchors.

338
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:03,968
You had me worried to death!

339
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:06,554
But Sean said that we
needed to drop the anchors.

340
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:08,681
I'm the one you should be listening to.

341
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:11,434
Do you think dropping anchor
in the middle of a storm...

342
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,936
...makes any sense whatsoever?

343
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:17,398
Come on.

344
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:21,736
Tamara?

345
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,573
Tamara, did you hear
the announcement?

346
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:57,772
Help me!

347
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:48,382
I managed to scrounge this shit up
in the game rooms and hallways.

348
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:51,969
All right, grab what you want.

349
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:56,140
- What are you taking, Julius?
- Nothing...

350
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,357
...but this gun.

351
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:19,664
J.J.?

352
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,916
J.J.?

353
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:24,919
Are you down here?

354
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:30,883
J.J.?

355
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:06,377
We got a major problem, Wayne.

356
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:13,884
Shit, I can't see a damn thing.

357
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:41,162
No.

358
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:49,545
No.

359
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:28,626
J.J.

360
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:57,571
Did you find Rennie?

361
00:51:57,739 --> 00:52:00,908
She's locked safely in her room,
no thanks to either of you.

362
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:04,078
Have you brought her
back on course yet?

363
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:06,247
He's doing the best he can.

364
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:09,083
He's the son of a captain,
for chrissakes.

365
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:14,171
He ought to be able to operate
this thing. Well, do something!

366
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:50,916
- It worked. We're back on course.
- Good!

367
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:58,132
- What's that?
- The fire alarm.

368
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:06,515
We've already thought about that.

369
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:09,226
Nobody could possibly see a flare gun
in this storm.

370
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:13,981
There's only one person who needs to
see it. I'm gonna find that deck hand.

371
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:15,524
But what about the fire?

372
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:19,403
- How do we know there is one?
- What are you talking about?

373
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:21,197
Use some common sense.

374
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:23,574
Setting off a fire alarm causes panic...

375
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:26,452
...the same kind of panic
caused by suggesting...

376
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:29,872
...that Jason Voorhees is alive
and aboard this ship.

377
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,832
Enough is enough.

378
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:34,913
Help me!

379
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:57,436
<i>Help! Help me!</i>

380
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:23,170
Rennie.

381
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:26,465
I don't understand
what's happening to me!

382
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:39,061
- What is that?
- The power room.

383
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:41,772
All right, listen, everybody.

384
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:45,067
I want you to stay here until
I get back with the others, all right?

385
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:47,444
- You understand?
- Yeah.

386
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:07,274
Water's gotten into the engines.

387
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:22,122
We have to get everybody
off the ship!

388
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:28,962
Rennie! Hang on!

389
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:31,507
Sean!

390
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:58,742
Rennie! What the hell--?
Let go of her!

391
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:02,246
She never should have set foot
on this ship. It's all your fault!

392
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:03,580
This is Jason's fault.

393
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:05,791
Not another word about Jason,
do you hear me?

394
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:08,210
No, I don't!

395
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:12,130
It's time you listen to me,
if you want off this ship alive.

396
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:19,638
Thank God.
I just lowered the lifeboat.

397
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:21,807
We have to go.

398
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:24,768
Wait! I left the others
in the restaurant.

399
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:26,979
There is no more restaurant.

400
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:31,692
Come on, honey.

401
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:39,992
Get back!

402
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:43,579
Son of a bitch!

403
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:56,675
Come on, Charles.

404
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:11,023
Here, grab my hand!

405
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:12,441
Come on.

406
01:00:16,404 --> 01:00:17,863
Hurry up!

407
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:19,406
Come on.

408
01:00:21,242 --> 01:00:23,493
Watch it. Watch it.
Come on, now.

409
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:25,621
Come on. Come on. Come on.

410
01:00:28,916 --> 01:00:31,793
- Sean! Careful.
- One last step. Come on!

411
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:37,007
Grab on to my arm. That's it.

412
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:42,095
- Start rowing!
- Come on!

413
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:45,140
Come on! Come on!

414
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:02,324
Julius!

415
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:05,285
Pull him in.

416
01:01:21,886 --> 01:01:23,970
Keep rowing!

417
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:59,339
I hope you can find shore soon,
captain.

418
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:02,759
We all don't wanna drown out here.

419
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:08,348
Do you have any idea
where we are, Sean?

420
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:24,489
Hey. Hey, Sean.

421
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:28,160
Come on, man.
I made it. So can you, huh.

422
01:02:29,287 --> 01:02:30,954
All right, man.

423
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:20,921
Hey, man. Yo. Yo, wake up!

424
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:23,924
Oh, shit! Check it out! Heh. Damn!

425
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,259
We're in New York! Woo-hoo!

426
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:29,012
You did it, man! You did it!

427
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:33,183
We are in New York!
New York City! Woo-hoo!

428
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:35,685
Yeah!

429
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:41,441
I don't believe it, we made it!

430
01:03:41,734 --> 01:03:45,278
<i>If I can make it there</i>

431
01:03:45,446 --> 01:03:49,157
<i>I'll make it, boom, boom, anywhere</i>

432
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:54,955
<i>It's up to you, New York, New York</i>

433
01:04:13,224 --> 01:04:15,475
There must be a phone
around here somewhere.

434
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:19,813
Wonderful choice of places
to dock a boat, Mr. Robertson.

435
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:22,607
Wonderful.

436
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:05,066
- I can't believe we made it.
- I can't believe we're still alive.

437
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:07,569
We are all very lucky.

438
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:19,873
Give me your money.

439
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:23,335
Everybody shut up
and give him the money. Now!

440
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:26,796
Give me the money. Come on.

441
01:05:26,964 --> 01:05:28,089
Here.

442
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:35,221
Got some good shit here, homes.

443
01:05:35,389 --> 01:05:37,849
You got that right.

444
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:43,355
Give me your wallet. Come on!

445
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:51,446
- Now, ain't that sweet.
- Bastard!

446
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:54,783
Go ahead, Superman, be a hero.

447
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:58,244
- Hey, come on, now--
- You got a problem, dad?

448
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:06,544
No!

449
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:14,594
- Please don't hurt her.
- Hurt this princess?

450
01:06:15,721 --> 01:06:17,639
Would I do that?

451
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:22,102
You look like a real party girl,
princess.

452
01:06:22,269 --> 01:06:24,938
You wanna go on a date
with me and my friend?

453
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:26,773
If you're free, that is.

454
01:06:31,529 --> 01:06:35,031
<i>Follow us, we blow her fucking
head off, comprende?</i>

455
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:39,995
So, what, we just gonna stand here?
Let's go.

456
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:44,833
Julius! Calm down, will you?
You heard what he said. He'll kill her!

457
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:47,460
We have to find the police.

458
01:06:48,754 --> 01:06:50,380
Well, look.

459
01:06:50,548 --> 01:06:55,802
I think we'll be more productive
if we split up, okay?

460
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:59,889
- All right, but, Charles, suppose we--
- Colleen. No discussions now, please!

461
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:24,039
Help! Stop it! Help! Somebody help me!

462
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:25,540
Shut the fuck up!

463
01:07:27,334 --> 01:07:30,170
Welcome to the Casbah, princess.

464
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:42,557
Please, don't hurt me.

465
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:47,187
Loosen up, baby. You'll feel
way better if you're stoned.

466
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:59,866
Better slang us some more 'caine,
JoJo. We only got a half load here.

467
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:02,494
We're in for a long night.

468
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:17,092
It's your parade, princess.

469
01:08:17,802 --> 01:08:20,428
It can be smooth, it can be rough.

470
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:22,639
It's your choice.

471
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:31,106
Come on, baby.
Lay back and enjoy it.

472
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:39,906
I think I'm in love.

473
01:08:53,337 --> 01:08:55,588
Forgot my money, homes.

474
01:08:59,885 --> 01:09:01,678
Who the fuck are you?

475
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:08,810
You're dead, fuckhead.

476
01:09:25,452 --> 01:09:27,120
Shit!

477
01:10:10,998 --> 01:10:15,501
Come on. Operator, this is
an emergency, get me the police.

478
01:10:56,001 --> 01:11:00,380
Use the combos, keep the feet light.
This is it.

479
01:12:34,224 --> 01:12:36,476
Take your best shot...

480
01:12:37,561 --> 01:12:40,063
...motherfucker.

481
01:13:21,355 --> 01:13:26,109
- Rennie? What did they do to you?
- He's here, Sean.

482
01:13:26,276 --> 01:13:29,404
- Jason is here.
- Oh, God.

483
01:13:32,366 --> 01:13:34,867
We have to find the others now.

484
01:13:44,545 --> 01:13:45,837
- Freeze!
- Ah.

485
01:13:46,004 --> 01:13:47,713
It's okay, she's with me.

486
01:13:50,843 --> 01:13:53,719
My apologies, miss.
Are you all right?

487
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:55,513
Hey!

488
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:59,058
Rennie! Rennie. Rennie.

489
01:13:59,226 --> 01:14:01,352
Oh, thank God.

490
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:04,313
Are you okay?

491
01:14:11,738 --> 01:14:14,907
Mr. McCulloch,
Jason is here in New York.

492
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:20,580
- Rennie saw him.
- Just shut up about Jason, will you?

493
01:14:20,747 --> 01:14:22,957
Is it true, Rennie?

494
01:14:30,174 --> 01:14:34,051
You're right. I find it a tall tale indeed,
but you seem like honest folk...

495
01:14:34,219 --> 01:14:37,763
...so I'm inclined to believe
at least some of what you say.

496
01:14:37,931 --> 01:14:40,433
Yeah, well, first order of business
is to find Julius.

497
01:14:40,601 --> 01:14:43,686
I'm sure he'll pop up
soon enough. I'll call for backup.

498
01:14:49,109 --> 01:14:50,651
Oh, Jesus!

499
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:55,573
Dispatch! Dispatch!

500
01:14:58,619 --> 01:15:00,870
Open the door!
Let's get out of here!

501
01:15:01,705 --> 01:15:02,747
The handle!

502
01:15:11,131 --> 01:15:13,799
Hold it! What are you doing?

503
01:15:28,273 --> 01:15:30,816
For God's sake, Rennie, slow down!

504
01:15:50,504 --> 01:15:52,296
Come on!

505
01:15:54,299 --> 01:15:57,343
- Rennie!
- Quickly! Let's move!

506
01:16:01,932 --> 01:16:04,183
Miss Van Deusen!

507
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:12,710
It's so pretty today.

508
01:17:12,961 --> 01:17:14,712
Yeah.

509
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:17,381
Perfect day for swimming.

510
01:17:18,008 --> 01:17:19,133
Hmm?

511
01:17:20,552 --> 01:17:22,928
You know, young lady,
you've been coming out here...

512
01:17:23,096 --> 01:17:27,933
...every summer for the last three years,
and you still haven't learned how to swim.

513
01:17:29,186 --> 01:17:32,271
I'll take some lessons this time.
I promise.

514
01:17:34,691 --> 01:17:37,151
Now, that's what you said last year.

515
01:17:38,445 --> 01:17:42,948
I think the time has come
for your first swimming lesson.

516
01:17:44,034 --> 01:17:48,954
You don't wanna end up drowning
like that Voorhees boy, do you?

517
01:17:49,122 --> 01:17:51,666
He never learned how to swim either.

518
01:17:52,751 --> 01:17:55,127
And he's still in the
bottom of this lake.

519
01:17:55,295 --> 01:17:59,215
- He is not.
- Yes, indeed, he is.

520
01:17:59,383 --> 01:18:05,429
And he's ready to pull down
anybody who falls in and can't swim.

521
01:18:05,597 --> 01:18:07,807
You're telling a lie.

522
01:18:07,974 --> 01:18:11,435
Am I? Let's find out.

523
01:18:18,735 --> 01:18:22,071
You better swim, Rennie,
before Jason pulls you down.

524
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:25,324
- I-- I can't!
- Yes, you can, and you will!

525
01:18:25,492 --> 01:18:27,952
Come on! Rennie, swim!

526
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:15,791
You pushed me into the lake.

527
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:20,171
Rennie, I....

528
01:19:21,047 --> 01:19:23,340
I was only trying to teach you.

529
01:19:23,508 --> 01:19:26,510
You almost killed me.
I was drowning.

530
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:30,890
I pulled you out.
I saved your life.

531
01:19:31,057 --> 01:19:32,933
You son of a bitch.

532
01:19:34,561 --> 01:19:36,353
He was down there.

533
01:19:39,357 --> 01:19:40,399
Rennie!

534
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:45,362
Just keep away from her!

535
01:19:46,364 --> 01:19:47,907
Rennie!

536
01:20:05,509 --> 01:20:08,093
You. You.

537
01:20:08,261 --> 01:20:11,639
It's-- It's not possible!

538
01:20:49,719 --> 01:20:52,054
Please! Wait!

539
01:20:52,222 --> 01:20:55,266
I'm begging you! Please!

540
01:21:46,067 --> 01:21:48,944
I was at school when they told me.

541
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:53,324
"Rennie, your parents died
in a car accident."

542
01:21:56,536 --> 01:21:58,913
It just seems like
everybody I care about...

543
01:22:00,206 --> 01:22:01,874
...I lose.

544
01:22:04,336 --> 01:22:06,879
That's not gonna happen this time.

545
01:23:58,575 --> 01:24:00,909
Help!

546
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:16,341
- What are you doing?
- What is this?

547
01:24:16,509 --> 01:24:18,594
- This isn't my stop!
- Come on!

548
01:24:24,517 --> 01:24:26,560
Get it moving!

549
01:25:39,092 --> 01:25:41,468
Oh, my God.

550
01:26:21,634 --> 01:26:23,302
It's over.

551
01:27:01,007 --> 01:27:03,300
- Somebody please help us!
- Go!

552
01:27:21,069 --> 01:27:23,946
You are dead meat, slimebag!

553
01:27:31,246 --> 01:27:34,498
Yo, man. It's cool.
It's cool, man. It's cool.

554
01:27:45,385 --> 01:27:47,261
Times Diner. Yeah.

555
01:27:47,428 --> 01:27:49,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We're open till 3 a.m., like always.

556
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:51,556
You've got to call the police.

557
01:27:51,724 --> 01:27:55,143
There's a pay phone in back.
But it's broke.

558
01:27:55,311 --> 01:27:59,815
Look, you don't understand,
there is a maniac trying to kill us.

559
01:28:01,192 --> 01:28:03,151
Welcome to New York.

560
01:28:16,791 --> 01:28:19,126
Son of a bitch. Unh!

561
01:29:13,222 --> 01:29:14,765
Come on!

562
01:29:26,152 --> 01:29:27,861
Come on!

563
01:30:25,753 --> 01:30:28,171
What the hell are you kids
doing down here?

564
01:30:28,339 --> 01:30:29,840
Can you help us get out of here?

565
01:30:30,007 --> 01:30:32,259
Sure can, but we haven't got
a minute to spare.

566
01:30:32,427 --> 01:30:34,845
- What do you mean?
- Toxic waste, son.

567
01:30:35,012 --> 01:30:37,848
The sewer floods out with the stuff
every night at midnight...

568
01:30:38,015 --> 01:30:39,724
...less than ten minutes from now.

569
01:30:39,892 --> 01:30:41,601
Come on, follow me.

570
01:31:28,649 --> 01:31:32,861
You didn't get me in the lake,
and you're not gonna get me now!

571
01:32:43,099 --> 01:32:44,349
Sean.

572
01:32:44,517 --> 01:32:46,601
Sean, get up!

573
01:32:51,148 --> 01:32:53,233
Get up, Sean!

574
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:01,366
Go!

575
01:33:04,787 --> 01:33:05,829
Climb!

576
01:33:26,684 --> 01:33:27,726
Shit!

577
01:33:38,696 --> 01:33:42,282
Mommy! Don't let me drown!

578
01:33:43,242 --> 01:33:45,035
Mommy!

579
01:34:27,745 --> 01:34:30,538
Help! Help!

580
01:35:40,943 --> 01:35:45,321
I hear there's a statue here
that's, uh, 22 stories tall.

581
01:36:17,354 --> 01:36:18,897
Toby!

582
