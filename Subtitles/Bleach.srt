00:00:35,122 --> 00:00:37,708
Are you okay?

3
00:00:43,589 --> 00:00:45,967
Here you go.

4
00:00:47,051 --> 00:00:49,053
Okay, much better.

5
00:00:51,013 --> 00:00:52,515
Walk on this side.

6
00:00:53,015 --> 00:00:54,058
No.

7
00:00:54,642 --> 00:00:57,812
I'll walk on this side
so I can protect you.

8
00:00:58,396 --> 00:01:00,940
You're my hero.

9
00:01:03,067 --> 00:01:04,443
Mom.

10
00:01:05,444 --> 00:01:07,321
Can I hold your hand?

11
00:01:08,823 --> 00:01:10,283
Of course!

12
00:01:11,742 --> 00:01:12,868
Yeah!

13
00:01:24,255 --> 00:01:27,216
Doesn't she have an umbrella?

14
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:35,641
I'll lend her mine.

15
00:01:37,768 --> 00:01:38,811
Ichigo!

16
00:01:47,987 --> 00:01:50,990
It's cold.

17
00:01:51,907 --> 00:01:52,950
Ichigo!

18
00:01:53,034 --> 00:01:55,328
Mom, I'm cold.

19
00:01:56,537 --> 00:01:57,788
Ichigo!

20
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,008
Ichigo...

21
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,041
MYSTERIOUS SINKHOLE

22
00:03:58,075 --> 00:03:59,326
You punk!

23
00:04:04,081 --> 00:04:06,709
What's your problem?

24
00:04:08,961 --> 00:04:10,171
You three.

25
00:04:12,965 --> 00:04:14,258
Look over there.

26
00:04:20,097 --> 00:04:21,098
What?

27
00:04:24,477 --> 00:04:27,021
Question. What's that you see?

28
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,275
Answer me!

29
00:04:31,358 --> 00:04:34,361
Flowers for a kid who got run over.

30
00:04:34,445 --> 00:04:35,529
Correct!

31
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,578
Question. Who knocked them over like that?

32
00:04:43,329 --> 00:04:44,580
Us... on our skateboards.

33
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,001
Correct.

34
00:04:56,175 --> 00:04:58,010
You owe him an apology.

35
00:05:09,647 --> 00:05:10,940
Him?

36
00:05:11,023 --> 00:05:12,274
Who?

37
00:05:12,358 --> 00:05:13,567
Just apologize!

38
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:18,823
Forgive us!

39
00:05:18,906 --> 00:05:20,741
Not me, him!

40
00:05:20,825 --> 00:05:21,909
What?

41
00:05:22,618 --> 00:05:25,037
We apologize!

42
00:05:27,373 --> 00:05:30,000
We're really sorry!

43
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:41,178
I scared off those losers for good.

44
00:05:42,263 --> 00:05:43,263
Thank you.

45
00:05:43,681 --> 00:05:46,642
Don't hang around. Go to heaven.

46
00:05:47,226 --> 00:05:48,394
Okay.

47
00:05:53,816 --> 00:05:56,193
You go to hell!

48
00:06:04,493 --> 00:06:05,493
Chad.

49
00:06:06,245 --> 00:06:09,206
Ichigo, you better watch your back.

50
00:06:12,793 --> 00:06:14,253
Thank you.

51
00:06:23,262 --> 00:06:25,055
- I'm home.
- Hi, Ichigo.

52
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:27,725
You're late.

53
00:06:27,808 --> 00:06:28,934
Dad!

54
00:06:29,018 --> 00:06:31,478
Why are you so late?

55
00:06:31,562 --> 00:06:32,938
It's still 7:00!

56
00:06:33,022 --> 00:06:34,440
Don't talk back.

57
00:06:35,941 --> 00:06:39,820
We eat dinner as a family, don't forget!

58
00:06:39,903 --> 00:06:42,990
I guided a lost soul to heaven.

59
00:06:43,073 --> 00:06:45,784
I didn't ask you to do that!

60
00:06:45,868 --> 00:06:47,995
I can't help how I was born.

61
00:06:48,662 --> 00:06:50,331
Lay off, you two.

62
00:06:50,414 --> 00:06:52,916
Eat before it gets cold.

63
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,084
Forget them, Yuzu.

64
00:06:54,168 --> 00:06:56,837
I've had it! Good night!

65
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,465
- How about dinner?
- Wait!

66
00:06:59,548 --> 00:07:01,216
I won't eat your food.

67
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,469
That punk...

68
00:07:03,552 --> 00:07:04,720
Ichigo!

69
00:07:04,803 --> 00:07:08,891
He's stressed.
He's been seeing more ghosts lately.

70
00:07:11,101 --> 00:07:14,480
You mean, he tells you those things?

71
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,230
Yes.

72
00:07:18,067 --> 00:07:20,569
He doesn't tell me his problems.

73
00:07:21,904 --> 00:07:24,365
I wouldn't either, Dad.

74
00:07:26,075 --> 00:07:27,284
Wait, Yuzu.

75
00:07:28,619 --> 00:07:32,122
You communicate like a 14-year-old.

76
00:07:32,206 --> 00:07:35,084
I wouldn't confide in you.

77
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,794
Come on, Karin.

78
00:07:37,711 --> 00:07:38,712
Karin?

79
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,970
The kids are disrespectful lately.

80
00:07:46,971 --> 00:07:50,516
Masaki, where did I go wrong?

81
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,209
It's close.

82
00:08:23,465 --> 00:08:24,717
What is?

83
00:08:26,844 --> 00:08:28,095
You...

84
00:08:29,138 --> 00:08:30,806
You can see me?

85
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:34,226
What century did you die in? Just go.

86
00:08:46,488 --> 00:08:50,284
No. I don't want to go to hell.

87
00:08:50,868 --> 00:08:54,788
Have no fear.
You're going to Soul Society.

88
00:08:55,664 --> 00:08:57,666
It's a peaceful place.

89
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,889
What the hell was that?

90
00:09:11,972 --> 00:09:13,140
Where did he go?

91
00:09:18,771 --> 00:09:19,771
Grand Fisher?

92
00:09:20,814 --> 00:09:22,691
No. It's Fishbone.

93
00:09:24,401 --> 00:09:25,778
It's huge.

94
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:28,072
What's huge?

95
00:09:28,655 --> 00:09:31,241
You feel at home, don't you, ghost?

96
00:09:31,325 --> 00:09:32,325
Binding spell!

97
00:09:36,413 --> 00:09:38,165
What's this, ghost?

98
00:09:38,248 --> 00:09:40,667
I'm a soul reaper, not a ghost.

99
00:09:42,711 --> 00:09:43,587
A reaper?

100
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,880
Dad!

101
00:09:46,173 --> 00:09:47,007
Yuzu...

102
00:09:47,091 --> 00:09:49,760
- It's here.
- What's here?

103
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:02,022
A human... broke my spell.

104
00:10:05,317 --> 00:10:06,944
- Yuzu.
- You okay?

105
00:10:07,027 --> 00:10:10,114
Why did you scream, Yuzu?

106
00:10:14,535 --> 00:10:17,538
I heard a scary voice.

107
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:20,165
What voice?

108
00:10:23,168 --> 00:10:24,294
Where from?

109
00:10:36,265 --> 00:10:37,558
Hey...

110
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,437
What the hell was that?

111
00:10:44,189 --> 00:10:45,899
He saw the Hollow.

112
00:10:57,619 --> 00:10:59,079
What is this thing?

113
00:11:00,038 --> 00:11:02,124
Yuzu! Let her go!

114
00:11:11,091 --> 00:11:14,136
I want your soul.

115
00:11:14,845 --> 00:11:15,888
Don't move!

116
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:33,447
You must have high spiritual pressure
to see a Hollow.

117
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:34,448
Huh?

118
00:11:34,531 --> 00:11:36,700
Hollows eat souls like yours.

119
00:11:36,783 --> 00:11:37,868
That's what it wants.

120
00:11:40,954 --> 00:11:44,416
I want your soul.

121
00:11:44,499 --> 00:11:45,500
Mine?

122
00:11:52,382 --> 00:11:56,887
Give me your soul.

123
00:12:01,767 --> 00:12:02,935
What's going on?

124
00:12:04,186 --> 00:12:05,103
What is it?

125
00:12:05,187 --> 00:12:07,272
- A Hollow.
- Which is?

126
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:09,690
Look out!

127
00:12:14,571 --> 00:12:16,448
I stepped in too far.

128
00:12:17,282 --> 00:12:19,076
Get your hands off him!

129
00:12:47,062 --> 00:12:48,230
Are you okay?

130
00:12:49,147 --> 00:12:50,816
It got my good arm.

131
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,987
But if I don't fight,
it'll devour our souls.

132
00:12:55,904 --> 00:12:57,322
Isn't there a way?

133
00:12:58,865 --> 00:13:00,117
Yes, there is.

134
00:13:00,909 --> 00:13:02,077
Which is?

135
00:13:05,247 --> 00:13:06,581
You become a reaper.

136
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,291
Pardon?

137
00:13:10,002 --> 00:13:12,504
Only reapers can destroy Hollows.

138
00:13:13,338 --> 00:13:17,509
So you have to become one.
That's our only chance.

139
00:13:17,592 --> 00:13:18,802
How?

140
00:13:21,138 --> 00:13:24,391
I'll stab you in the center of your chest,

141
00:13:24,975 --> 00:13:28,395
and inject my energy through my Zanpakuto.

142
00:13:28,478 --> 00:13:29,855
If we fail, we'll...

143
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:33,442
both die.

144
00:13:33,525 --> 00:13:35,235
- No way!
- We must risk it!

145
00:13:35,318 --> 00:13:37,946
The Hollow will do anything to get you.

146
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:46,038
Give me your soul.

147
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:48,373
Ichigo...

148
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,084
I'm scared.

149
00:13:52,335 --> 00:13:53,837
Ichigo...

150
00:14:00,635 --> 00:14:01,928
Decide!

151
00:14:12,355 --> 00:14:13,355
Do it!

152
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:03,198
<i>His strong spiritual pressure...</i>

153
00:15:04,783 --> 00:15:06,576
<i>is making the sword huge!</i>

154
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,651
Are you really...

155
00:15:41,528 --> 00:15:43,029
just a human?

156
00:15:45,157 --> 00:15:46,283
What else?

157
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:49,911
I'm just a human.

158
00:16:01,756 --> 00:16:02,841
Was it a dream?

159
00:16:11,516 --> 00:16:13,143
That was intense.

160
00:16:33,622 --> 00:16:35,332
Is this from...

161
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,333
last night?

162
00:16:38,168 --> 00:16:39,503
It was a truck.

163
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,798
A hit-and-run. The driver lost control.

164
00:16:45,383 --> 00:16:47,052
<i>What's going on?</i>

165
00:16:47,135 --> 00:16:48,220
What?

166
00:16:49,012 --> 00:16:50,263
What happened?

167
00:16:51,515 --> 00:16:53,225
Yuzu, are you okay?

168
00:16:53,934 --> 00:16:55,101
Huh?

169
00:16:56,144 --> 00:16:58,813
You don't remember last night?

170
00:16:59,981 --> 00:17:01,483
What do you mean?

171
00:17:04,903 --> 00:17:07,572
Dad, what happened here?

172
00:17:17,749 --> 00:17:18,833
Quit it!

173
00:17:21,503 --> 00:17:23,672
Thinking about Ichigo again?

174
00:17:23,755 --> 00:17:25,298
No, I'm not!

175
00:17:26,258 --> 00:17:29,177
What's good about him, Orihime?

176
00:17:29,886 --> 00:17:34,224
He's grumpy, childish,
and his hair's orange.

177
00:17:34,307 --> 00:17:35,684
He's funny.

178
00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:37,602
Is he?

179
00:17:37,686 --> 00:17:40,021
You just don't get it, Tatsuki.

180
00:17:40,814 --> 00:17:44,317
When I think about his grumpy face...

181
00:17:49,281 --> 00:17:50,865
He's adorable!

182
00:17:50,949 --> 00:17:52,367
It's beyond me.

183
00:17:53,118 --> 00:17:57,747
A truck crashed into Ichigo's house
last night.

184
00:17:57,831 --> 00:17:58,957
A truck?

185
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,584
Is he okay?

186
00:18:02,002 --> 00:18:04,588
He's dead. He died on the spot.

187
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:06,840
I'm alive.

188
00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:09,676
You are, too!

189
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:12,178
Ichigo, are you okay?

190
00:18:12,262 --> 00:18:13,346
Sure I am.

191
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:16,391
Nothing can kill his kind.

192
00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:18,935
How about you, Chad?

193
00:18:19,436 --> 00:18:21,855
- Thank God!
- Calm down.

194
00:18:21,938 --> 00:18:25,150
How did a truck crash into your house?

195
00:18:25,233 --> 00:18:27,861
- It wasn't a truck.
- What then?

196
00:18:27,944 --> 00:18:29,029
A crane?

197
00:18:29,112 --> 00:18:32,449
A creature put its huge hand
through the wall.

198
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:38,038
You hit your head, Ichigo?

199
00:18:38,622 --> 00:18:40,123
Sounds like it.

200
00:18:40,206 --> 00:18:42,167
- I'm fine.
- Good morning!

201
00:18:48,131 --> 00:18:50,884
Rukia Kuchiki is our new classmate.

202
00:18:51,551 --> 00:18:52,886
Meet Ichigo.

203
00:18:56,514 --> 00:18:58,350
- You know her?
- No.

204
00:18:58,433 --> 00:18:59,433
Ichigo.

205
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,563
Is this textbook okay?

206
00:19:05,774 --> 00:19:08,109
MAKE A SCENE AND YOU'RE DEAD!

207
00:19:12,072 --> 00:19:13,531
<i>You can't return?</i>

208
00:19:13,615 --> 00:19:17,118
Only reapers can travel to Soul Society.

209
00:19:17,744 --> 00:19:21,956
I can't go back
because I lost my reaper powers.

210
00:19:22,582 --> 00:19:25,502
Where did your powers go?

211
00:19:30,298 --> 00:19:33,426
I gave you more than I intended to.

212
00:19:34,177 --> 00:19:36,805
Because of your high spiritual pressure.

213
00:19:37,722 --> 00:19:39,474
I'm not a reaper, am I?

214
00:19:40,517 --> 00:19:44,270
Your soul has turned into a reaper's soul.

215
00:19:46,147 --> 00:19:49,567
So now you're not a reaper,
people can see you?

216
00:19:51,695 --> 00:19:55,532
No, I disguised as a human
with a faux body.

217
00:19:55,615 --> 00:19:58,243
Reapers, spirits, Hollows are invisible.

218
00:19:58,868 --> 00:20:02,163
Anyway, I need my powers back.

219
00:20:03,998 --> 00:20:05,500
Wait!

220
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,089
Hey, that's me!

221
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:16,052
That's me! What's happening to me?

222
00:20:19,514 --> 00:20:23,184
Stab me with this and reverse the powers.

223
00:20:23,268 --> 00:20:24,602
- Wait!
- Two hands!

224
00:20:25,478 --> 00:20:27,897
- Ready?
- No, please don't!

225
00:20:38,867 --> 00:20:39,951
What?

226
00:20:40,744 --> 00:20:41,828
It's not working.

227
00:20:44,247 --> 00:20:45,247
Huh?

228
00:20:45,707 --> 00:20:47,625
Your energy's too low.

229
00:20:54,632 --> 00:20:56,760
What do we do now?

230
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,261
Hey.

231
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,475
I know.

232
00:21:03,975 --> 00:21:08,229
You can work with me
as a substitute reaper.

233
00:21:08,313 --> 00:21:09,731
Work?

234
00:21:10,732 --> 00:21:11,733
<i>Get this.</i>

235
00:21:12,984 --> 00:21:14,903
<i>There are two kinds of souls.</i>

236
00:21:17,113 --> 00:21:19,616
<i>One is Whole, the normal ones.</i>

237
00:21:20,158 --> 00:21:23,620
<i>The ghosts you see are this type.</i>

238
00:21:24,746 --> 00:21:28,041
<i>The others are Hollows that eat souls.</i>

239
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:33,171
<i>They're the souls of those
who died with a grudge.</i>

240
00:21:35,632 --> 00:21:38,092
<i>Reapers have two duties.</i>

241
00:21:38,718 --> 00:21:43,431
<i>We guide the Wholes to Soul Society
with a ritual.</i>

242
00:21:44,557 --> 00:21:46,351
<i>It's called a Soul Burial.</i>

243
00:21:48,436 --> 00:21:51,105
<i>I did this to the man in your bedroom.</i>

244
00:21:53,858 --> 00:21:58,404
<i>Our other duty is to destroy Hollows
with Zanpakuto.</i>

245
00:21:59,864 --> 00:22:02,158
<i>You'll help me do the latter.</i>

246
00:22:04,244 --> 00:22:05,245
No, I won't!

247
00:22:05,328 --> 00:22:09,374
The Hollows might harm innocent people!

248
00:22:09,457 --> 00:22:14,379
So what? I only fought last night
to protect my family.

249
00:22:14,879 --> 00:22:17,298
I'll return your powers.

250
00:22:17,382 --> 00:22:20,885
- Your energy's too low.
- You said it was high yesterday!

251
00:22:20,969 --> 00:22:24,264
It might work, but it will kill you.

252
00:22:25,223 --> 00:22:28,643
<i>Your soul has high pressure,
but it's untrained.</i>

253
00:22:29,269 --> 00:22:35,358
<i>Your body is too weak to survive it.</i>

254
00:22:35,441 --> 00:22:37,026
What should I do?

255
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:40,572
Destroy the Hollows
to increase your energy.

256
00:22:41,155 --> 00:22:44,659
<i>But to endure the energy,
you'll need training.</i>

257
00:22:44,742 --> 00:22:45,994
Training?

258
00:22:46,744 --> 00:22:49,664
Just give in to your fate.

259
00:22:49,747 --> 00:22:50,873
Forget it!

260
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:53,501
Screw fate!

261
00:22:54,252 --> 00:22:55,962
I want to be myself!

262
00:22:58,298 --> 00:22:59,549
I'm home.

263
00:23:01,009 --> 00:23:02,218
Hi.

264
00:23:02,302 --> 00:23:04,429
Have you seen my pajamas?

265
00:23:04,512 --> 00:23:05,805
Why would I?

266
00:23:08,016 --> 00:23:10,184
I can't find them.

267
00:23:18,276 --> 00:23:19,944
Don't barge into my room!

268
00:23:20,028 --> 00:23:21,487
It's my room.

269
00:23:21,988 --> 00:23:23,114
Yuzu's pajamas!

270
00:23:23,197 --> 00:23:25,533
I have no house or clothes,

271
00:23:25,617 --> 00:23:28,161
and you need my help to become a reaper.

272
00:23:28,244 --> 00:23:29,996
Forget it.

273
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:32,248
Give in to your fate.

274
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:34,375
Ichigo!

275
00:23:34,459 --> 00:23:35,960
Who's there?

276
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:38,129
Yes?

277
00:23:40,256 --> 00:23:41,674
- What's up?
- Nothing.

278
00:23:46,554 --> 00:23:47,847
Hello!

279
00:23:52,602 --> 00:23:55,772
Don't try sneaking girls in here!

280
00:23:55,855 --> 00:23:57,190
I am not.

281
00:24:01,277 --> 00:24:02,779
Hey, reaper.

282
00:24:03,404 --> 00:24:04,614
Rukia Kuchiki.

283
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,408
That's my name.

284
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,079
Get out of my sight right now.

285
00:24:11,162 --> 00:24:14,916
You can't escape your fate
to be a reaper's agent.

286
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:19,003
Comply with the rules of communal life.

287
00:24:19,087 --> 00:24:21,464
What do you mean, communal...

288
00:24:30,181 --> 00:24:31,641
Dad!

289
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:33,893
Let's go.

290
00:24:37,063 --> 00:24:38,063
Huh?

291
00:24:39,565 --> 00:24:40,775
Watch it!

292
00:24:41,901 --> 00:24:42,901
Hey!

293
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,364
What's this?

294
00:24:47,949 --> 00:24:49,367
Reaper training.

295
00:24:50,493 --> 00:24:52,453
This isn't training!

296
00:24:54,372 --> 00:24:55,372
Stop it!

297
00:24:58,501 --> 00:25:00,169
That does it!

298
00:25:01,879 --> 00:25:03,506
Hey!

299
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:04,924
Don't walk away.

300
00:25:06,843 --> 00:25:08,094
Ichigo!

301
00:25:08,177 --> 00:25:10,888
- Hi.
- You're dating the new girl?

302
00:25:10,972 --> 00:25:12,515
Of course not!

303
00:25:12,598 --> 00:25:13,598
Fast move.

304
00:25:15,351 --> 00:25:17,353
You waste no time.

305
00:25:19,939 --> 00:25:22,734
He's just showing the new girl around.

306
00:25:22,817 --> 00:25:25,236
What have you shown her?

307
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:26,404
How rude!

308
00:25:28,823 --> 00:25:29,991
Hello.

309
00:25:30,074 --> 00:25:32,201
We're just classmates.

310
00:25:33,286 --> 00:25:36,247
- Can I speak to you?
- Yes, Miss Kuchiki?

311
00:25:39,292 --> 00:25:42,587
Is it a stomachache?
Let's go to the nurse.

312
00:25:45,256 --> 00:25:46,424
She hit him.

313
00:25:46,507 --> 00:25:48,217
Did you see that?

314
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,140
No! Ouch!

315
00:26:04,817 --> 00:26:06,861
I have better things to do!

316
00:26:07,987 --> 00:26:09,030
I'm going.

317
00:26:18,998 --> 00:26:20,750
Why you...

318
00:26:23,336 --> 00:26:25,880
You're not a reaper now, so...

319
00:26:44,982 --> 00:26:46,692
Damn it.

320
00:27:11,509 --> 00:27:14,470
You have no friends...
I can be your friend.

321
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:21,978
A reaper and a human can't be friends.

322
00:27:22,728 --> 00:27:24,188
I'm kidding.

323
00:27:24,272 --> 00:27:26,148
Don't be so serious.

324
00:27:28,818 --> 00:27:32,655
I don't need friends.
I live by the reaper codes.

325
00:27:32,738 --> 00:27:34,824
Reaper codes?

326
00:27:37,451 --> 00:27:39,120
Hi, Ichigo.

327
00:27:40,913 --> 00:27:42,039
Orihime.

328
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,875
What's going on?

329
00:27:45,001 --> 00:27:46,878
Well, we...

330
00:27:48,963 --> 00:27:50,006
Rukia?

331
00:27:50,089 --> 00:27:52,675
Greetings, Orihime.

332
00:27:52,758 --> 00:27:53,676
That's old!

333
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:56,262
- It's in your book.
- My manga?

334
00:27:56,345 --> 00:27:58,764
- It's modern Japanese.
- It's not.

335
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,975
Sorry to interrupt.

336
00:28:01,684 --> 00:28:03,811
- See you.
- But...

337
00:28:08,065 --> 00:28:11,777
She completely misunderstands
our relationship.

338
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,654
Resume.

339
00:28:13,738 --> 00:28:15,114
I'm done.

340
00:28:15,197 --> 00:28:17,783
Reapers obey their superiors.

341
00:28:18,326 --> 00:28:20,328
Since when am I inferior to you?

342
00:28:21,037 --> 00:28:23,748
I need you to help me go back.

343
00:28:23,831 --> 00:28:26,083
You can make it in this world.

344
00:28:26,918 --> 00:28:29,587
You can be a swordsmanship coach.

345
00:28:30,212 --> 00:28:31,213
See you.

346
00:28:52,276 --> 00:28:55,780
URAHARA SHOP

347
00:29:08,417 --> 00:29:10,086
How's your faux body?

348
00:29:10,962 --> 00:29:14,257
You look all right
as a human high school girl.

349
00:29:14,882 --> 00:29:16,425
Don't be ridiculous.

350
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,553
I have no other choice.

351
00:29:22,348 --> 00:29:25,768
I have a new battery for you.

352
00:29:26,477 --> 00:29:27,728
Here.

353
00:29:54,422 --> 00:29:55,923
You have a plan?

354
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:03,222
Reapers who give their powers to a human
can be executed.

355
00:30:05,641 --> 00:30:09,312
You had no choice,
but you defied the reaper's code.

356
00:30:10,229 --> 00:30:12,732
They might find out.

357
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:21,449
I can't locate her spiritual pressure.

358
00:30:22,033 --> 00:30:26,329
Rukia wouldn't lose
to a lesser Hollow like Fishbone.

359
00:30:27,872 --> 00:30:28,956
Did she really...

360
00:30:30,166 --> 00:30:32,293
give her powers to a human?

361
00:30:32,376 --> 00:30:33,586
Find her.

362
00:30:34,628 --> 00:30:36,672
If she gave him her powers...

363
00:30:37,715 --> 00:30:39,133
detain her.

364
00:30:40,968 --> 00:30:42,887
That's an order from above.

365
00:31:12,124 --> 00:31:13,459
Who are you?

366
00:31:14,377 --> 00:31:15,920
So...

367
00:31:19,131 --> 00:31:20,633
you can see me.

368
00:31:22,676 --> 00:31:24,303
What do you want?

369
00:31:25,096 --> 00:31:29,475
I sensed high spiritual pressure
and found you.

370
00:31:34,313 --> 00:31:35,481
Rukia.

371
00:31:36,565 --> 00:31:37,858
You know her?

372
00:31:38,984 --> 00:31:41,821
The reaper woman who visited you.

373
00:31:41,904 --> 00:31:42,988
A reaper?

374
00:31:43,656 --> 00:31:45,157
As if I do.

375
00:31:45,241 --> 00:31:46,826
Don't play dumb!

376
00:31:48,577 --> 00:31:51,831
She was after a Hollow known
as Grand Fisher.

377
00:31:51,914 --> 00:31:55,084
And she was attracted to your powers.

378
00:31:55,167 --> 00:31:56,752
Grand Fisher?

379
00:31:56,836 --> 00:31:58,087
Hey.

380
00:31:59,422 --> 00:32:00,881
Where's Rukia?

381
00:32:02,508 --> 00:32:04,844
I don't know any reapers.

382
00:32:05,886 --> 00:32:07,930
Don't lie to me.

383
00:32:34,415 --> 00:32:35,916
The arrow...

384
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:52,390
It means...

385
00:32:53,767 --> 00:32:55,060
it's a Quincy.

386
00:33:18,751 --> 00:33:19,960
<i>Rukia.</i>

387
00:33:21,337 --> 00:33:22,963
Tell me why you are here.

388
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,383
What do you mean?

389
00:33:27,468 --> 00:33:32,932
You see, I hate being the last one
to know what's going on.

390
00:33:34,934 --> 00:33:36,143
Like what?

391
00:33:36,227 --> 00:33:37,520
You're lying.

392
00:33:38,938 --> 00:33:40,689
Don't hide things from me.

393
00:33:42,191 --> 00:33:44,026
I'm hiding nothing.

394
00:33:44,109 --> 00:33:47,571
Then why did the red-haired reaper
try to kill me?

395
00:33:51,784 --> 00:33:52,993
I knew it.

396
00:33:55,204 --> 00:33:56,288
Spill it out.

397
00:34:02,962 --> 00:34:04,338
Then I'll tell you.

398
00:34:04,838 --> 00:34:07,383
You came here chasing a Grand Hollow.

399
00:34:07,466 --> 00:34:10,094
Now the red-haired reaper wants you.

400
00:34:10,177 --> 00:34:12,763
And I almost got killed for hiding you.

401
00:34:12,846 --> 00:34:14,598
Shut up and start training.

402
00:34:14,682 --> 00:34:16,225
Is that a joke?

403
00:34:16,308 --> 00:34:18,435
Don't get me involved!

404
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:20,104
You need to train!

405
00:34:20,187 --> 00:34:21,730
What for?

406
00:34:21,814 --> 00:34:25,109
I don't care if you're stuck here!

407
00:34:25,192 --> 00:34:27,820
Who said you could live here...

408
00:34:30,155 --> 00:34:31,490
<i>Train or...</i>

409
00:34:32,866 --> 00:34:34,243
<i>you'll die.</i>

410
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:42,376
Are you certain?

411
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:49,633
When a Hollow turns up,
Rukia will emerge with that human.

412
00:35:19,246 --> 00:35:21,707
Where do you think she lives?

413
00:35:22,875 --> 00:35:26,420
- Maybe with Ichigo.
- Really?

414
00:35:26,503 --> 00:35:29,506
Relax. It's just a rumor.

415
00:35:32,384 --> 00:35:34,219
FIGHT YOURSELF!

416
00:35:35,137 --> 00:35:36,388
Dad...

417
00:35:46,315 --> 00:35:47,315
You're...

418
00:35:47,941 --> 00:35:49,026
a reaper.

419
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,239
I thought so.

420
00:35:55,324 --> 00:35:57,117
Are you an idiot?

421
00:35:57,201 --> 00:35:59,578
Your spiritual pressure is high.

422
00:36:00,537 --> 00:36:06,126
But it got higher in the last few days
since the new girl came.

423
00:36:06,919 --> 00:36:08,462
That girl...

424
00:36:08,545 --> 00:36:12,007
she looks human, so that's a faux body.

425
00:36:15,052 --> 00:36:16,470
Who are you?

426
00:36:17,054 --> 00:36:19,765
You've never noticed me, have you?

427
00:36:20,432 --> 00:36:24,853
You transferred here a year ago,
but we've never talked.

428
00:36:26,355 --> 00:36:28,023
Who the hell are you?

429
00:36:29,525 --> 00:36:31,568
My name is Uryu Ishida.

430
00:36:33,404 --> 00:36:37,199
How do you know
I have high spiritual pressure?

431
00:36:37,908 --> 00:36:41,954
I'm from the Quincy tribe
and reapers killed my people.

432
00:36:43,706 --> 00:36:46,166
Is anyone sane around here?

433
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,292
Watch this.

434
00:37:13,152 --> 00:37:14,528
The arrows yesterday...

435
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,906
That was you.

436
00:37:18,574 --> 00:37:20,617
Are you convinced?

437
00:37:21,285 --> 00:37:24,079
I'm a human, but I can destroy Hollows.

438
00:37:24,663 --> 00:37:30,043
I live to exorcize Hollows
and avenge my tribe.

439
00:37:31,587 --> 00:37:35,841
A year ago, I sensed your power,
so I came here.

440
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:43,307
Wait!

441
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:44,600
I challenge you.

442
00:37:45,309 --> 00:37:46,351
What?

443
00:37:46,935 --> 00:37:49,980
We share the world with other beings.

444
00:37:51,356 --> 00:37:52,733
Humans...

445
00:37:53,442 --> 00:37:54,777
lost souls...

446
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,280
and souls that became Hollows and reapers.

447
00:37:58,363 --> 00:38:01,033
Plus, those who hate reapers.

448
00:38:01,116 --> 00:38:04,787
There's a turbulent world
that people can't see.

449
00:38:05,662 --> 00:38:09,875
If you're a reaper,
it's my fate to defeat you.

450
00:38:10,459 --> 00:38:12,586
Wait! This is too complicated!

451
00:38:12,669 --> 00:38:17,925
I'll prove that the Quincies are
superior to the reapers.

452
00:38:19,718 --> 00:38:20,886
Hey, don't!

453
00:38:20,969 --> 00:38:22,012
Use your sword.

454
00:38:22,095 --> 00:38:23,095
No!

455
00:38:26,016 --> 00:38:27,309
Well, then...

456
00:38:28,268 --> 00:38:30,771
I'll have to force you to be a reaper.

457
00:38:49,164 --> 00:38:50,582
What did you do?

458
00:38:52,626 --> 00:38:53,836
Ichigo!

459
00:38:53,919 --> 00:38:55,462
Hollows are on the move!

460
00:38:57,548 --> 00:38:58,548
Get to work!

461
00:38:59,091 --> 00:39:01,426
What? Wait a minute!

462
00:39:06,348 --> 00:39:08,225
- What?
- Hollows!

463
00:39:08,308 --> 00:39:09,852
So, what?

464
00:39:09,935 --> 00:39:14,690
Exorcize them so your powers increase.
Then, I can go back!

465
00:39:14,773 --> 00:39:18,443
No way.
Who cares about reapers and Hollows?

466
00:39:18,527 --> 00:39:21,572
Someone help me, please!

467
00:39:21,655 --> 00:39:22,698
That voice...

468
00:39:23,866 --> 00:39:24,866
Hey!

469
00:39:31,331 --> 00:39:35,377
All these Hollows!
Is someone baiting them?

470
00:39:37,629 --> 00:39:40,591
They might attack people
or spirits any time.

471
00:39:49,975 --> 00:39:51,727
I'm scared.

472
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:54,563
He hasn't gone to heaven yet.

473
00:40:03,363 --> 00:40:04,698
Wait!

474
00:40:04,781 --> 00:40:08,827
You must protect all people and spirits,
not just him.

475
00:40:09,328 --> 00:40:10,328
Huh?

476
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:13,582
Reapers treat all spirits
and people equally.

477
00:40:14,082 --> 00:40:17,127
Take an oath if you want to save him.

478
00:40:20,672 --> 00:40:22,966
Screw the reaper oath!

479
00:40:33,644 --> 00:40:34,895
Go now.

480
00:40:38,315 --> 00:40:41,693
I'm not so noble
to risk my life for strangers...

481
00:40:43,278 --> 00:40:47,199
or so low to desert people in trouble!

482
00:40:59,378 --> 00:41:00,504
I'm here!

483
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:23,276
Watch it!

484
00:41:42,087 --> 00:41:43,213
Renji!

485
00:42:04,192 --> 00:42:05,819
You're slow.

486
00:42:27,424 --> 00:42:29,134
Don't mess with reapers.

487
00:42:39,561 --> 00:42:41,104
That was easy.

488
00:42:48,487 --> 00:42:49,863
Don't, Renji.

489
00:42:55,577 --> 00:42:57,662
You didn't dodge that.

490
00:42:58,497 --> 00:43:00,165
I went easy on you.

491
00:43:02,042 --> 00:43:03,168
Why are you here?

492
00:43:03,251 --> 00:43:04,836
You know why.

493
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:09,466
To take you in
and kill the human with your powers.

494
00:43:12,886 --> 00:43:15,972
What's that look on your face?

495
00:43:17,474 --> 00:43:20,143
It's offensive that you look so human!

496
00:43:22,687 --> 00:43:27,567
We were both born in Rukon District
and adopted by the noble Kuchiki Clan.

497
00:43:28,193 --> 00:43:32,447
You were groomed to become
an elite soul reaper!

498
00:43:34,658 --> 00:43:37,285
You shouldn't look like a human.

499
00:43:39,913 --> 00:43:42,624
Right, Captain Kuchiki?

500
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,630
Brother...

501
00:44:07,524 --> 00:44:09,526
Why did you break the code?

502
00:44:11,778 --> 00:44:15,907
I gave him my powers
so I wouldn't be eaten.

503
00:44:16,867 --> 00:44:19,411
I gave him all my powers by mistake.

504
00:44:19,494 --> 00:44:21,496
That's an excuse.

505
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:28,545
What you did is a felony.

506
00:44:30,213 --> 00:44:34,050
You'd be executed
if you went back to Soul Society.

507
00:44:36,595 --> 00:44:40,182
You have to get your powers back from him.

508
00:44:41,933 --> 00:44:43,476
Then you will be pardoned.

509
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:48,523
He'd die if I did that now.
His pressure is too low.

510
00:44:49,566 --> 00:44:50,734
So?

511
00:44:52,485 --> 00:44:53,737
Let him die.

512
00:44:57,198 --> 00:45:00,035
It was I who gave him my powers.

513
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:03,079
It wasn't his fault.

514
00:45:07,375 --> 00:45:10,795
A reaper's job isn't to kill innocent men.

515
00:45:15,425 --> 00:45:17,969
Why do you feel compassion for him?

516
00:45:18,053 --> 00:45:19,679
I don't.

517
00:45:19,763 --> 00:45:21,681
Retrieve your powers from him...

518
00:45:23,016 --> 00:45:24,142
and kill him.

519
00:45:25,769 --> 00:45:27,187
Or else, Rukia...

520
00:45:28,813 --> 00:45:30,315
you'll die.

521
00:45:37,781 --> 00:45:39,366
You have until the full moon.

522
00:45:40,909 --> 00:45:42,160
Wait.

523
00:45:42,661 --> 00:45:43,745
Brother!

524
00:45:44,788 --> 00:45:47,332
Get the Hollow to the west, Renji.

525
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:11,690
Your wounds must heal
before you return to your human self.

526
00:46:12,273 --> 00:46:15,443
Or you might die, both body and soul.

527
00:46:21,157 --> 00:46:22,701
What will we do?

528
00:46:24,536 --> 00:46:25,912
Rukia...

529
00:46:43,346 --> 00:46:45,640
Okay, much better.

530
00:46:46,808 --> 00:46:48,309
Walk on this side.

531
00:46:48,393 --> 00:46:49,894
No.

532
00:46:49,978 --> 00:46:53,815
I'll walk on this side
so I can protect you.

533
00:46:53,898 --> 00:46:57,068
You're my hero.

534
00:46:59,112 --> 00:47:01,448
Is it okay if I hold your hand?

535
00:47:02,032 --> 00:47:03,616
Of course!

536
00:47:08,329 --> 00:47:09,372
Ichigo!

537
00:47:24,929 --> 00:47:27,307
Mom?

538
00:47:51,956 --> 00:47:53,041
Dad...

539
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,336
Hey, you're awake.

540
00:47:58,922 --> 00:48:01,466
That was some accident you had.

541
00:48:02,842 --> 00:48:04,552
A classmate brought you here.

542
00:48:05,762 --> 00:48:08,056
Bring her home some time!

543
00:48:15,688 --> 00:48:17,565
I dreamed about Mom.

544
00:48:19,275 --> 00:48:22,403
The anniversary of her death is soon.

545
00:48:24,405 --> 00:48:26,574
I dream about her sometimes.

546
00:48:33,623 --> 00:48:35,250
Me too. Every night.

547
00:48:42,215 --> 00:48:44,968
I failed to protect her.

548
00:48:48,012 --> 00:48:49,681
Mom died...

549
00:48:52,976 --> 00:48:54,561
because of me.

550
00:49:04,779 --> 00:49:06,322
It turns out...

551
00:49:09,492 --> 00:49:11,286
I can't protect anyone.

552
00:49:13,163 --> 00:49:14,914
You got that wrong, son.

553
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:18,668
The love of my life...

554
00:49:19,711 --> 00:49:21,296
died protecting you.

555
00:49:24,174 --> 00:49:25,758
I'm proud of her for that.

556
00:49:32,056 --> 00:49:33,057
Guys!

557
00:49:34,267 --> 00:49:37,353
Apparently, Ichigo was in an accident!

558
00:49:37,437 --> 00:49:38,938
Is he okay?

559
00:49:41,482 --> 00:49:44,027
He's dead. He died on the spot.

560
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:45,445
I'm alive.

561
00:49:46,154 --> 00:49:49,657
Good! Nothing kills his kind, right?

562
00:49:49,741 --> 00:49:51,367
Ichigo!

563
00:49:54,162 --> 00:49:55,872
The bandage...

564
00:49:58,416 --> 00:49:59,834
It's nothing.

565
00:50:34,369 --> 00:50:36,788
Ichigo isn't himself.

566
00:50:37,872 --> 00:50:39,791
Rukia ditched him?

567
00:50:39,874 --> 00:50:42,543
You mean, they were dating?

568
00:50:42,627 --> 00:50:44,462
You knew that!

569
00:50:45,004 --> 00:50:46,881
This is your chance, Orihime.

570
00:50:47,882 --> 00:50:51,177
ICHIGO KUROSAKI

571
00:50:51,261 --> 00:50:52,804
He's not ready.

572
00:51:00,311 --> 00:51:02,689
Retrieve your powers from him...

573
00:51:03,731 --> 00:51:04,857
and kill him.

574
00:51:06,776 --> 00:51:08,319
Or else, Rukia...

575
00:51:09,529 --> 00:51:10,905
you'll die.

576
00:51:13,241 --> 00:51:14,993
<i>You have until the full moon.</i>

577
00:51:31,592 --> 00:51:32,592
<i>Look out!</i>

578
00:51:34,512 --> 00:51:36,931
Get your hands off him!

579
00:51:40,059 --> 00:51:41,477
Hey, Rukia.

580
00:51:44,981 --> 00:51:46,441
That night...

581
00:51:48,735 --> 00:51:50,611
why did you save me?

582
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:59,996
I'm nobody, but you gave me
your reaper powers...

583
00:52:01,247 --> 00:52:03,624
knowing it would incriminate you.

584
00:52:08,046 --> 00:52:09,422
That night...

585
00:52:10,757 --> 00:52:13,926
we both could've died.

586
00:52:19,265 --> 00:52:20,725
But...

587
00:52:24,145 --> 00:52:26,689
you saved me.

588
00:52:29,525 --> 00:52:31,569
Risking your own life.

589
00:52:39,827 --> 00:52:40,828
Rukia?

590
00:53:16,823 --> 00:53:17,824
Wait...

591
00:53:18,908 --> 00:53:19,909
He'd know!

592
00:53:33,798 --> 00:53:34,798
There he is!

593
00:53:36,217 --> 00:53:37,885
Where's Soul Society?

594
00:53:41,681 --> 00:53:43,266
You're so abrupt.

595
00:53:44,225 --> 00:53:46,769
Rukia's gone. Did she go back?

596
00:53:47,353 --> 00:53:48,896
How would I know?

597
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:52,150
You have to tell me where Soul Society is!

598
00:53:52,233 --> 00:53:55,736
Then what? Will you bring her back?

599
00:53:58,364 --> 00:53:59,782
What if I did?

600
00:54:00,741 --> 00:54:02,201
Intriguing.

601
00:54:02,869 --> 00:54:07,498
<i>The reaper who attacked you
is a top combatant...</i>

602
00:54:08,082 --> 00:54:09,709
named Renji Abarai.

603
00:54:09,792 --> 00:54:11,461
Just tell me!

604
00:54:12,795 --> 00:54:15,173
I don't know how to get there.

605
00:54:15,256 --> 00:54:16,841
You don't?

606
00:54:18,301 --> 00:54:19,510
But...

607
00:54:20,803 --> 00:54:23,055
I know someone who does.

608
00:54:25,975 --> 00:54:30,855
<i>A reaper was exiled from Soul Society
and lives here.</i>

609
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:34,984
What can I do?

610
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:42,158
I don't think Rukia has gone back
to Soul Society.

611
00:54:43,409 --> 00:54:45,703
She'd be executed if she did.

612
00:54:46,537 --> 00:54:49,624
She wouldn't waste her life like that.

613
00:54:52,168 --> 00:54:55,838
I think she's trying to protect you.

614
00:54:56,881 --> 00:54:58,007
How?

615
00:55:00,927 --> 00:55:06,974
She'd risk her life by asking
her brother to spare you.

616
00:55:10,811 --> 00:55:12,688
To protect me.

617
00:55:14,815 --> 00:55:17,527
That human will attract the Grand Fisher.

618
00:55:19,028 --> 00:55:22,281
I'll exorcize it and redeem myself...

619
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:25,076
and please the superiors.

620
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:27,161
So let him live.

621
00:55:30,706 --> 00:55:32,083
Rukia...

622
00:55:35,962 --> 00:55:37,672
you have a scheme?

623
00:55:40,216 --> 00:55:44,136
If that's what Rukia does,

624
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,014
she might get killed on the spot.

625
00:55:49,934 --> 00:55:53,604
By her ruthless brother, Byakuya.

626
00:55:59,026 --> 00:56:03,155
<i>You can enter Soul Society from anywhere.</i>

627
00:56:03,239 --> 00:56:06,784
<i>The reapers' favorite portal is near here.</i>

628
00:56:07,368 --> 00:56:10,121
You'd put yourself at risk for him?

629
00:56:10,204 --> 00:56:11,414
No.

630
00:56:11,497 --> 00:56:14,417
You'd disobey your older brother?

631
00:56:16,377 --> 00:56:18,379
You distrust me?

632
00:56:21,007 --> 00:56:22,675
You'd defy me...

633
00:56:23,509 --> 00:56:25,261
to protect him?

634
00:56:27,305 --> 00:56:30,016
Answer me, Rukia.

635
00:56:33,269 --> 00:56:34,604
Answer me.

636
00:56:37,982 --> 00:56:41,736
Hurry up and kill that human, Rukia.

637
00:56:43,654 --> 00:56:44,780
That way...

638
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:47,575
you'll be pardoned.

639
00:56:53,831 --> 00:56:54,999
Rukia!

640
00:56:56,042 --> 00:56:57,752
Why not kill him?

641
00:56:57,835 --> 00:57:00,838
The Grand Fisher will eat him anyway!

642
00:57:01,589 --> 00:57:05,343
He's just bait, a piece of garbage!
Kill him!

643
00:57:05,426 --> 00:57:07,136
Enough!

644
00:57:16,103 --> 00:57:17,772
You just sit and watch.

645
00:57:18,606 --> 00:57:21,025
That Grand whatever-the-hell...

646
00:57:21,943 --> 00:57:23,819
I'll destroy it!

647
00:57:27,865 --> 00:57:29,659
Great timing.

648
00:57:31,077 --> 00:57:33,204
I'll kill him for you!

649
00:57:33,287 --> 00:57:34,330
Renji!

650
00:57:34,914 --> 00:57:35,998
Hold it.

651
00:57:39,043 --> 00:57:41,420
Go on. Give it a try, human.

652
00:57:42,463 --> 00:57:43,506
But, Captain...

653
00:57:44,423 --> 00:57:46,300
Destroy the Grand Fisher.

654
00:57:47,343 --> 00:57:48,511
Yeah.

655
00:57:49,428 --> 00:57:51,097
On one condition.

656
00:57:53,557 --> 00:57:55,309
If I succeed...

657
00:57:56,394 --> 00:57:58,145
you free Rukia.

658
00:58:05,945 --> 00:58:07,029
Rukia...

659
00:58:08,072 --> 00:58:10,741
complete my reaper training...

660
00:58:11,617 --> 00:58:13,786
and I'll defeat the Grand Fisher.

661
00:58:14,954 --> 00:58:19,583
And you'll get your powers back
triple fold.

662
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:42,148
<i>Us reapers have pursued the Grand Fisher
for 54 years.</i>

663
00:58:44,775 --> 00:58:50,573
<i>It's more powerful and agile
than any Hollow we've encountered.</i>

664
00:58:53,242 --> 00:58:54,618
<i>It uses a lure</i>

665
00:58:55,202 --> 00:58:58,330
<i>to attract those
with strong spiritual pressure</i>

666
00:58:58,873 --> 00:59:00,374
<i>and preys on their souls.</i>

667
00:59:02,084 --> 00:59:04,295
<i>As your powers increase...</i>

668
00:59:05,504 --> 00:59:07,590
<i>it will be drawn to you.</i>

669
00:59:14,138 --> 00:59:15,138
No?

670
00:59:48,923 --> 00:59:50,132
Look.

671
00:59:50,216 --> 00:59:51,884
What's going on?

672
00:59:57,765 --> 01:00:00,851
Ichigo was doing kendo by the river.

673
01:00:00,935 --> 01:00:02,269
He was?

674
01:00:02,353 --> 01:00:05,397
He's training with Rukia.

675
01:00:05,481 --> 01:00:07,650
Ichigo? Why?

676
01:00:07,733 --> 01:00:10,277
- To be slim?
- An action star!

677
01:00:10,361 --> 01:00:11,862
- Yeah.
- Right?

678
01:00:11,946 --> 01:00:15,825
An action star!
Well, he has the body for it.

679
01:00:15,908 --> 01:00:17,952
Way to go!

680
01:00:20,996 --> 01:00:22,790
<i>One thing about exorcism.</i>

681
01:00:23,541 --> 01:00:26,293
<i>You're not killing the Hollow.</i>

682
01:00:27,378 --> 01:00:29,880
<i>You're redeeming its sins.</i>

683
01:00:31,465 --> 01:00:33,425
Go for its forehead.

684
01:00:34,009 --> 01:00:37,513
Even the Grand Fisher
can't tolerate being hit there.

685
01:00:37,596 --> 01:00:39,098
That's Grand Fisher?

686
01:00:39,932 --> 01:00:41,267
Kind of.

687
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:43,185
I'm fighting this?

688
01:00:43,269 --> 01:00:44,979
I'm sure it's huge.

689
01:00:46,522 --> 01:00:48,691
You said it's been after me?

690
01:00:49,567 --> 01:00:51,485
- Right.
- Since when?

691
01:00:52,570 --> 01:00:55,322
Probably since you were a kid.

692
01:00:59,994 --> 01:01:01,704
You think I saw it?

693
01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:06,333
Only you know that.

694
01:01:07,877 --> 01:01:10,171
Grand Fisher sightings are rare.

695
01:01:10,921 --> 01:01:13,174
Some say it's a great beast.

696
01:01:13,757 --> 01:01:16,510
Others say it's like an evil flower.

697
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:20,764
What was it?

698
01:01:22,933 --> 01:01:24,852
I mean, originally.

699
01:01:25,561 --> 01:01:28,480
- Sorry?
- Before it turned into a Hollow.

700
01:01:29,815 --> 01:01:33,194
At first, it was a girl's spirit.

701
01:01:37,698 --> 01:01:38,824
A girl...

702
01:01:47,249 --> 01:01:48,250
What's wrong?

703
01:01:48,334 --> 01:01:49,877
A girl's spirit...

704
01:01:51,212 --> 01:01:52,880
You remember something?

705
01:01:54,298 --> 01:01:55,549
Yes.

706
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:58,802
Rukia...

707
01:02:02,473 --> 01:02:04,975
it sounds like this is personal.

708
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:19,114
Ichigo beat up some thugs a while back.

709
01:02:20,366 --> 01:02:21,951
They might show up.

710
01:02:23,077 --> 01:02:26,497
Is he preparing for that?

711
01:02:28,916 --> 01:02:31,669
Your friend's up against something bigger.

712
01:02:34,797 --> 01:02:38,801
It might be too big for him to handle.

713
01:02:40,636 --> 01:02:46,183
He might die,
but he'll take up the challenge.

714
01:03:58,172 --> 01:03:59,214
I did it!

715
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:05,970
Hey!

716
01:04:06,638 --> 01:04:07,638
Here!

717
01:04:09,767 --> 01:04:10,851
Yeah!

718
01:04:11,518 --> 01:04:13,687
- You did it!
- Right?

719
01:04:15,773 --> 01:04:18,025
- What's this?
- High five.

720
01:04:22,613 --> 01:04:24,281
There you go.

721
01:04:24,782 --> 01:04:26,200
I like that.

722
01:04:32,539 --> 01:04:34,541
Are you sure, Captain?

723
01:04:34,625 --> 01:04:37,002
He won't make it anyway.

724
01:04:37,961 --> 01:04:41,048
He's just bait to lure the Grand Fisher.

725
01:04:42,549 --> 01:04:44,802
You'll destroy the Grand Fisher.

726
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:50,224
And you'll kill Rukia, too.

727
01:04:57,147 --> 01:04:59,775
She won't be able to kill him.

728
01:05:01,693 --> 01:05:03,195
She is attached to him.

729
01:05:05,322 --> 01:05:09,535
That's as deadly
as an ailment for a reaper.

730
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:12,830
It weakens a reaper...

731
01:05:14,748 --> 01:05:17,543
and if it is serious, it's lethal.

732
01:05:22,631 --> 01:05:27,636
We're here to plan
Mom's memorial ceremony.

733
01:05:28,554 --> 01:05:30,764
Any ideas? Raise your hand!

734
01:05:30,848 --> 01:05:32,015
Me, me!

735
01:05:32,099 --> 01:05:33,767
Yuzu on lunch duty.

736
01:05:33,851 --> 01:05:37,271
Karin on flowers, incense and offerings.

737
01:05:37,354 --> 01:05:38,564
Don't ignore us!

738
01:05:38,647 --> 01:05:40,023
I raised my hand!

739
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:42,693
I'm on beer duty.

740
01:05:42,776 --> 01:05:45,446
- That's for you.
- No way.

741
01:05:45,529 --> 01:05:48,157
It's for me and your mother.

742
01:05:49,199 --> 01:05:51,743
Bring other stuff, too.

743
01:05:56,331 --> 01:05:58,417
You're going on a picnic?

744
01:06:00,836 --> 01:06:01,836
A picnic...

745
01:06:03,589 --> 01:06:04,798
I guess so.

746
01:06:06,383 --> 01:06:08,302
We are visiting Mom's grave.

747
01:06:09,928 --> 01:06:14,349
Of course, my dad
and my sisters loved her.

748
01:06:17,144 --> 01:06:18,520
They all loved her...

749
01:06:20,397 --> 01:06:22,191
and I took her away from them.

750
01:06:24,902 --> 01:06:26,778
Is it so valuable...

751
01:06:28,405 --> 01:06:29,948
a family's bond?

752
01:06:31,992 --> 01:06:35,537
Don't you have anyone back home?

753
01:06:37,873 --> 01:06:38,957
I have no parents.

754
01:06:50,511 --> 01:06:52,304
You could stay in our world.

755
01:06:55,307 --> 01:06:56,975
I'll be your friend.

756
01:06:59,686 --> 01:07:01,146
That's impossible.

757
01:07:01,730 --> 01:07:03,106
Why?

758
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:04,900
It's against the codes.

759
01:07:07,611 --> 01:07:08,946
The codes...

760
01:07:10,113 --> 01:07:12,491
Reapers are so inflexible.

761
01:07:24,753 --> 01:07:25,921
Anyway...

762
01:07:32,678 --> 01:07:33,762
thank you.

763
01:07:38,934 --> 01:07:40,769
When you say something like that...

764
01:07:42,604 --> 01:07:43,814
I feel happy.

765
01:08:17,389 --> 01:08:18,682
Up we go!

766
01:08:19,474 --> 01:08:25,022
I get so tired
climbing this hill every year.

767
01:08:25,105 --> 01:08:26,315
Come on!

768
01:08:27,232 --> 01:08:28,609
I'll go first.

769
01:08:29,526 --> 01:08:33,530
Dad, you cheat!

770
01:08:35,657 --> 01:08:40,495
Ichigo, can you please go down
to the vending machine?

771
01:08:40,579 --> 01:08:42,873
I'm so thirsty I could die.

772
01:08:42,956 --> 01:08:46,585
- I want pineapple juice.
- Why ask for it now?

773
01:08:46,668 --> 01:08:48,086
I'm thirsty now!

774
01:08:48,879 --> 01:08:51,089
Fine. Go on ahead.

775
01:08:52,966 --> 01:08:53,967
Come on.

776
01:09:05,270 --> 01:09:06,688
See anything?

777
01:09:06,772 --> 01:09:07,898
Nothing yet.

778
01:09:09,816 --> 01:09:13,820
MASAKI KUROSAKI

779
01:09:15,947 --> 01:09:18,909
Here's to you, Masaki.

780
01:09:32,381 --> 01:09:33,715
About Ichigo...

781
01:09:36,802 --> 01:09:38,470
Can't you tell him...

782
01:09:40,013 --> 01:09:41,723
that it's not his fault?

783
01:09:50,649 --> 01:09:53,110
What's that girl doing there?

784
01:10:12,421 --> 01:10:13,505
It's close.

785
01:10:18,301 --> 01:10:19,720
What's wrong?

786
01:10:20,303 --> 01:10:21,471
Are you okay?

787
01:10:38,155 --> 01:10:40,699
What's taking them so long?

788
01:10:53,128 --> 01:10:54,337
Grand Fisher!

789
01:11:00,218 --> 01:11:02,095
I knew it was you.

790
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:09,603
Rukia!

791
01:11:11,271 --> 01:11:12,397
Ready!

792
01:11:16,943 --> 01:11:18,570
You killed Mom!

793
01:11:24,493 --> 01:11:26,453
Go behind it!

794
01:11:41,259 --> 01:11:42,677
Ichigo.

795
01:11:44,679 --> 01:11:45,764
Mom.

796
01:12:00,237 --> 01:12:01,571
Ichigo.

797
01:12:13,041 --> 01:12:14,793
How I missed you.

798
01:12:26,721 --> 01:12:27,806
It's an illusion!

799
01:12:38,692 --> 01:12:41,570
How dare you bring Mom into our fight!

800
01:12:41,653 --> 01:12:44,072
I've been waiting for you!

801
01:12:50,453 --> 01:12:53,790
Where are you, Yuzu? Karin?

802
01:12:56,543 --> 01:12:58,044
Sleep a while.

803
01:13:10,098 --> 01:13:11,391
It's begun.

804
01:13:18,064 --> 01:13:20,317
- What's that?
- A tornado!

805
01:13:23,361 --> 01:13:24,613
Run for it!

806
01:14:03,568 --> 01:14:04,986
A tornado!

807
01:14:06,821 --> 01:14:08,531
What the...

808
01:14:30,971 --> 01:14:32,180
Is it a tornado?

809
01:14:32,973 --> 01:14:34,265
Oh, my God!

810
01:14:38,311 --> 01:14:39,312
It's here.

811
01:14:51,825 --> 01:14:52,951
Guys!

812
01:14:56,746 --> 01:14:58,081
Ichigo...

813
01:14:58,665 --> 01:15:00,291
<i>They can't see me.</i>

814
01:15:07,507 --> 01:15:08,758
Damn!

815
01:15:39,372 --> 01:15:40,372
Chad.

816
01:15:41,833 --> 01:15:43,501
Take care of them.

817
01:15:48,590 --> 01:15:49,716
Ichigo...

818
01:15:51,551 --> 01:15:53,178
You felt him too, Chad?

819
01:15:54,846 --> 01:15:56,765
- What?
- Ichigo?

820
01:15:57,515 --> 01:16:01,436
I'm sure it was him.

821
01:16:06,983 --> 01:16:08,651
Everyone, out!

822
01:16:09,319 --> 01:16:10,904
This way!

823
01:16:11,654 --> 01:16:12,822
Hurry!

824
01:16:50,151 --> 01:16:51,151
Ichigo!

825
01:16:53,238 --> 01:16:58,368
I have to win this battle no matter what!

826
01:17:17,262 --> 01:17:18,721
That was close.

827
01:17:19,514 --> 01:17:20,515
You!

828
01:17:22,976 --> 01:17:24,185
A Quincy.

829
01:17:48,710 --> 01:17:50,545
Damn you!

830
01:17:51,462 --> 01:17:53,006
I've got this covered.

831
01:17:53,089 --> 01:17:56,342
I need you alive
so I can challenge you some day.

832
01:18:27,248 --> 01:18:30,752
You're finished!

833
01:19:00,949 --> 01:19:02,116
Ichigo!

834
01:19:08,539 --> 01:19:09,582
The forehead!

835
01:19:20,718 --> 01:19:21,719
<i>Did I miss?</i>

836
01:19:36,484 --> 01:19:38,444
Mom, I'll protect you.

837
01:20:19,819 --> 01:20:20,945
Ichigo!

838
01:20:21,863 --> 01:20:24,407
Are you okay?

839
01:20:43,509 --> 01:20:44,927
Thank you.

840
01:20:46,888 --> 01:20:48,598
Don't flatter yourself.

841
01:20:49,307 --> 01:20:50,975
It was my chance.

842
01:20:53,603 --> 01:20:55,563
You and your attitude.

843
01:21:03,196 --> 01:21:05,490
I'm surprised. You destroyed Grand Fisher.

844
01:21:12,246 --> 01:21:15,124
A Quincy will make my sword rusty.

845
01:21:19,379 --> 01:21:20,588
Now, die.

846
01:21:21,339 --> 01:21:22,673
No, Renji!

847
01:21:22,757 --> 01:21:23,757
Rukia...

848
01:21:27,053 --> 01:21:29,555
stop pretending to be a human.

849
01:21:37,021 --> 01:21:38,856
What's wrong, Rukia?

850
01:21:43,111 --> 01:21:45,947
Where's the reaper in you gone?

851
01:21:48,574 --> 01:21:53,079
A human and a reaper
shouldn't get emotionally involved.

852
01:21:57,375 --> 01:21:59,252
Kill the man.

853
01:22:04,173 --> 01:22:06,217
I order you to, for the last time.

854
01:22:11,848 --> 01:22:13,057
Rukia.

855
01:22:19,522 --> 01:22:20,690
You...

856
01:22:21,774 --> 01:22:23,234
can't be cured.

857
01:22:32,994 --> 01:22:34,078
Renji.

858
01:22:36,164 --> 01:22:37,290
Kill...

859
01:22:37,957 --> 01:22:39,375
both of them.

860
01:22:49,135 --> 01:22:51,262
Keep your word, asshole.

861
01:22:52,096 --> 01:22:53,096
Ichigo.

862
01:22:53,973 --> 01:22:55,516
I'll protect you.

863
01:22:58,686 --> 01:23:00,938
- No, run!
- I won't.

864
01:23:37,391 --> 01:23:38,851
You're slow.

865
01:23:41,437 --> 01:23:42,855
You're dead.

866
01:24:21,185 --> 01:24:22,395
Is that all?

867
01:25:25,916 --> 01:25:27,418
That all you've got?

868
01:25:38,638 --> 01:25:39,972
It's my turn.

869
01:25:41,515 --> 01:25:45,144
You're 2,000 years too early
to be my rival.

870
01:25:52,860 --> 01:25:55,613
Hear the Zabimaru roar!

871
01:26:44,829 --> 01:26:46,080
Adios.

872
01:27:07,101 --> 01:27:09,603
Looks like I killed your boyfriend.

873
01:27:12,898 --> 01:27:16,402
No hard feelings, Rukia.

874
01:27:35,004 --> 01:27:37,339
Something tells me...

875
01:27:42,386 --> 01:27:44,597
that you won't defeat me.

876
01:27:57,485 --> 01:27:59,403
<i>Is he invincible?</i>

877
01:28:43,113 --> 01:28:46,158
Renji... step back.

878
01:29:09,348 --> 01:29:10,850
Brace yourself.

879
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:28,868
You're slow.

880
01:29:41,547 --> 01:29:42,840
Ichigo!

881
01:29:55,561 --> 01:29:56,895
Wait a minute.

882
01:30:04,987 --> 01:30:09,199
If you can stand, run!
You're no match for him!

883
01:30:32,389 --> 01:30:33,515
Rukia...

884
01:30:35,726 --> 01:30:37,519
it's time you woke up.

885
01:30:43,150 --> 01:30:44,485
I'll...

886
01:30:45,402 --> 01:30:46,945
protect her.

887
01:31:06,090 --> 01:31:07,841
I'm not done yet.

888
01:32:32,092 --> 01:32:33,427
Ichigo!

889
01:33:39,451 --> 01:33:41,119
Not yet.

890
01:33:49,711 --> 01:33:51,505
He won't give up.

891
01:33:57,177 --> 01:34:01,849
We're not finished yet.

892
01:34:04,393 --> 01:34:06,520
How dare you...

893
01:34:33,046 --> 01:34:34,464
You lowly human!

894
01:34:36,884 --> 01:34:40,929
How dare you grab my brother's cape?

895
01:34:47,227 --> 01:34:49,062
Move any closer...

896
01:34:50,689 --> 01:34:52,649
and I'll destroy you!

897
01:35:23,722 --> 01:35:24,848
Brother...

898
01:35:27,059 --> 01:35:28,769
I've awakened.

899
01:35:30,812 --> 01:35:32,397
I, Rukia Kuchiki...

900
01:35:33,982 --> 01:35:36,735
beg for my sin to be redeemed.

901
01:35:40,697 --> 01:35:42,324
Do you mean it?

902
01:35:51,583 --> 01:35:52,584
Yes.

903
01:36:17,776 --> 01:36:19,111
Very well.

904
01:36:22,864 --> 01:36:24,116
We'll return.

905
01:36:27,119 --> 01:36:28,161
Yes.

906
01:36:47,556 --> 01:36:49,266
Return my powers to me.

907
01:36:55,188 --> 01:36:59,568
And you'll get back the normal life
you wanted.

908
01:37:03,196 --> 01:37:04,531
As a result...

909
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:08,869
you'll forget everything.

910
01:37:12,330 --> 01:37:13,790
Including me.

911
01:37:16,543 --> 01:37:17,919
Everything.

912
01:37:26,511 --> 01:37:28,722
I've had enough of humans.

913
01:37:30,891 --> 01:37:32,476
Especially you.

914
01:37:34,061 --> 01:37:36,688
You're rowdy and ill-tempered...

915
01:37:38,106 --> 01:37:39,649
and irresponsible!

916
01:37:59,419 --> 01:38:00,462
Rukia.

917
01:38:13,266 --> 01:38:14,601
So long...

918
01:38:17,312 --> 01:38:18,522
Ichigo.

919
01:39:27,966 --> 01:39:29,342
I was protected...

920
01:39:32,679 --> 01:39:33,847
again.

921
01:40:17,599 --> 01:40:18,975
Good morning.

922
01:40:19,059 --> 01:40:20,602
You slept so long.

923
01:40:22,062 --> 01:40:23,563
You feeling okay?

924
01:40:27,651 --> 01:40:29,402
I had a dream.

925
01:40:31,196 --> 01:40:32,781
I don't remember the details...

926
01:40:34,324 --> 01:40:36,034
but it was long.

927
01:40:46,836 --> 01:40:49,381
- You're up, Ichigo.
- Yeah.

928
01:40:51,508 --> 01:40:54,135
Eat well and live well.

929
01:40:54,886 --> 01:40:57,847
Age well till you go bald.

930
01:41:00,433 --> 01:41:02,227
And die smiling, son.

931
01:41:06,898 --> 01:41:08,942
Make your life worth living.

932
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:28,586
The tornado at the train station
was devastating!

933
01:41:28,670 --> 01:41:30,380
Ichigo was there, too.

934
01:41:31,214 --> 01:41:32,632
Is he okay?

935
01:41:34,884 --> 01:41:36,845
- He's...
- I'm alive.

936
01:41:37,387 --> 01:41:40,098
Good! I knew you'd be okay.

937
01:41:42,934 --> 01:41:44,686
Ichigo...

938
01:41:47,188 --> 01:41:49,816
You look kind of different.

939
01:41:50,442 --> 01:41:52,944
You look... taller?

940
01:41:54,404 --> 01:41:55,572
No way.

941
01:41:56,531 --> 01:41:59,242
<i>You have my gratitude, Ichigo.</i>

942
01:42:00,452 --> 01:42:04,622
<i>Nobody else has ever risked
his life for me.</i>

943
01:42:04,706 --> 01:42:05,957
Good morning.

944
01:42:06,041 --> 01:42:07,041
Wait.

945
01:42:08,668 --> 01:42:10,337
Have we ever talked?

946
01:42:12,047 --> 01:42:13,548
No.

947
01:42:15,300 --> 01:42:16,593
Good to know you.

948
01:42:17,260 --> 01:42:18,303
Yeah.

949
01:42:25,769 --> 01:42:30,523
<i>I'm back in Soul Society
to redeem my sins,</i>

950
01:42:31,232 --> 01:42:33,360
<i>but I don't regret what I did.</i>

951
01:42:35,278 --> 01:42:37,238
<i>I made a human friend.</i>

952
01:42:41,826 --> 01:42:42,827
<i>But...</i>

953
01:42:43,620 --> 01:42:45,955
<i>everyone's memory of me...</i>

954
01:42:46,748 --> 01:42:48,541
<i>has been wiped clean.</i>

955
01:42:52,253 --> 01:42:53,380
<i>Yours, too.</i>

956
01:42:53,463 --> 01:42:55,965
<i>You won't remember me.</i>

957
01:42:58,927 --> 01:43:00,095
<i>Never.</i>

958
01:43:00,845 --> 01:43:04,265
MAKE A SCENE AND YOU'RE DEAD!

959
01:43:09,604 --> 01:43:10,647
<i>I think.</i>

960
01:43:11,305 --> 01:44:11,776
