1
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:26,234
Please, don't leave me in here.

2
00:01:26,978 --> 00:01:29,378
Jake, I promise I won't be long.

3
00:01:30,081 --> 00:01:32,572
She'll kill me before you get back.

4
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,917
You're very safe here.

5
00:01:36,655 --> 00:01:39,215
All right? Nobody's gonna harm you.

6
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:42,019
We're only locking the door

7
00:01:42,127 --> 00:01:44,687
because we're worried
you might try and leave again.

8
00:01:44,797 --> 00:01:47,197
I left because she was in here.

9
00:01:48,534 --> 00:01:52,402
Why? Why are you doing this to me?

10
00:01:52,504 --> 00:01:53,937
I promise you, Jake,

11
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:58,809
I would never let
anything bad happen to you.

12
00:02:03,016 --> 00:02:05,610
Jake, I'm not trying to punish you,

13
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:09,678
but I have to be sure that you're safe
while I tend to other patients.

14
00:02:11,558 --> 00:02:13,753
You see that camera up there?

15
00:02:15,695 --> 00:02:18,562
Someone will be watching you
the whole time.

16
00:02:20,835 --> 00:02:22,598
That won't stop her.

17
00:02:25,773 --> 00:02:29,539
You have got to get some rest.

18
00:02:32,446 --> 00:02:35,779
She killed my whole family.
She's gonna kill me.

19
00:02:36,283 --> 00:02:38,478
- She's gonna kill me.
- Hey, easy.

20
00:02:38,686 --> 00:02:41,849
Please. Please don't leave.

21
00:02:41,956 --> 00:02:44,084
I'm so sorry.

22
00:02:44,192 --> 00:02:47,628
Nobody should have to go through
what you've been through.

23
00:02:48,463 --> 00:02:50,124
It doesn't matter.

24
00:02:52,968 --> 00:02:54,993
I'm already dead.

25
00:02:59,908 --> 00:03:02,069
I'll be back as soon as I can.

26
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,209
No. No.

27
00:03:59,904 --> 00:04:01,269
She's here.

28
00:04:07,779 --> 00:04:11,875
No. She's here! Let me out! She's here!

29
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:42,279
Dr. Sullivan, you'd better get down there.

30
00:08:02,824 --> 00:08:04,348
Another nightmare?

31
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:06,154
Sorry to wake you.

32
00:08:07,261 --> 00:08:09,355
It's that same dream again?

33
00:08:16,739 --> 00:08:18,366
Go back to sleep.

34
00:09:20,305 --> 00:09:22,739
It was left on my desk to shame me.

35
00:09:23,608 --> 00:09:25,166
It never stops.

36
00:09:26,244 --> 00:09:29,372
"BIZARRE DEATH FOR
AMERICAN TRAGEDY SURVIVOR"

37
00:09:30,148 --> 00:09:34,050
We'll move. We can leave Tokyo if you want.

38
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,116
It's not just about what happened today.

39
00:09:38,757 --> 00:09:41,420
What makes you sure this is part of it?

40
00:09:41,527 --> 00:09:46,328
If you follow it from the beginning,
it's all connected,

41
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:49,796
and now it's in Chicago.

42
00:09:50,169 --> 00:09:53,730
This happened in Chicago?
Then it has nothing to do with us.

43
00:09:54,507 --> 00:09:56,065
Yes, it does.

44
00:09:58,044 --> 00:09:59,944
I can't hide from this anymore.

45
00:10:00,112 --> 00:10:02,580
Naoko, you're upset. People are talking.

46
00:10:03,016 --> 00:10:04,643
Let them talk.

47
00:10:05,252 --> 00:10:08,380
I told you,
it's not about what happened at the office.

48
00:10:08,856 --> 00:10:11,791
Naoko! Naoko!

49
00:10:14,061 --> 00:10:16,291
I understand your feelings,

50
00:10:16,897 --> 00:10:19,058
but it's out of your control.

51
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:23,028
People are dying.

52
00:10:23,637 --> 00:10:26,471
There's nothing you can do about it.

53
00:10:30,645 --> 00:10:33,876
There is. There is!

54
00:11:35,211 --> 00:11:37,510
Wait, hey. What about me?

55
00:11:40,618 --> 00:11:43,678
Watch out for the fire alarm.

56
00:11:44,422 --> 00:11:47,220
There's a closet wall, too.
Where're your keys?

57
00:12:03,141 --> 00:12:06,406
- How many have we done it in?
- A lot.

58
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,887
You do know the only reason I'm dating you

59
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:21,722
is 'cause you have the keys
to a whole apartment building, right?

60
00:12:23,129 --> 00:12:26,257
I don't have the keys to anything.
My brother does.

61
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,129
You know the only reason I'm dating you

62
00:12:29,235 --> 00:12:31,465
is 'cause I need a fashion model
for my designs.

63
00:12:31,571 --> 00:12:34,734
You know I'm cool with that.
You can dress me up.

64
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:37,571
I'm really happy we're doing this together.

65
00:12:37,677 --> 00:12:42,637
Yeah. New York's gonna be awesome.
They have no idea what's about to hit them.

66
00:12:42,749 --> 00:12:46,208
- Wait till you see what's about to hit you.
- Nice.

67
00:12:49,256 --> 00:12:50,382
What?

68
00:12:56,063 --> 00:12:58,258
- Oh, my God.
- Shit.

69
00:12:58,365 --> 00:13:00,230
What apartment is this?

70
00:13:01,468 --> 00:13:03,766
Fuck, this is where that family...

71
00:13:08,977 --> 00:13:11,969
- Come on. Let's go.
- Okay.

72
00:13:27,095 --> 00:13:30,587
- Rose, why so many dolls?
- It's a going away party.

73
00:13:30,699 --> 00:13:32,531
- For who?
- Lisa.

74
00:13:36,238 --> 00:13:37,535
Rose?

75
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:42,902
- Is it time for your medicine?
- No, I'm okay.

76
00:13:46,882 --> 00:13:49,715
I'm letting Lisa take two of my dolls
with her on the trip.

77
00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:52,413
- Are you?
- They wanna see the world.

78
00:13:52,955 --> 00:13:56,289
And what about you, Rose?
Do you want to see the world?

79
00:13:56,393 --> 00:13:58,793
I'm gonna when Lisa gets famous.

80
00:14:04,234 --> 00:14:07,431
Hey. Hey, just put it out of your mind, Lis.

81
00:14:07,537 --> 00:14:10,631
Okay? Forget about it.
We're out of here soon enough.

82
00:14:10,741 --> 00:14:12,333
Yeah, but I knew them.

83
00:14:12,442 --> 00:14:17,244
I know you did, but it's the past,
and the past can't hurt you.

84
00:14:18,349 --> 00:14:19,441
Okay?

85
00:14:21,953 --> 00:14:24,513
- I'll call you later.
- Okay.

86
00:14:32,096 --> 00:14:33,256
There she is.

87
00:14:33,364 --> 00:14:34,490
Lisa!

88
00:14:35,566 --> 00:14:36,760
Hi, Rose.

89
00:14:36,868 --> 00:14:40,304
- Hey, Gretchen. Where's Max?
- Right behind you.

90
00:14:40,405 --> 00:14:43,841
- Thanks for watching her, Gretchen.
- Always a pleasure.

91
00:14:44,743 --> 00:14:47,337
Rose is an angel.

92
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:48,775
How's the painting going?

93
00:14:48,881 --> 00:14:53,648
Well, the arthritis makes it hard.
I use more ointment than paint these days.

94
00:14:53,752 --> 00:14:54,912
- Bye, Rose.
- Bye.

95
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,647
- Have a good party.
- I will.

96
00:14:56,755 --> 00:14:58,347
- Bye.
- Bye.

97
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:02,626
You're late.
I had to ask Gretchen to look after Rose.

98
00:15:02,728 --> 00:15:05,095
I'm sorry. I lost track of time.

99
00:15:05,665 --> 00:15:07,792
- What?
- Cough them up.

100
00:15:09,302 --> 00:15:11,236
We just needed a little privacy.

101
00:15:11,337 --> 00:15:13,567
You're leaving town with the guy.
Can't it wait?

102
00:15:13,673 --> 00:15:14,765
Wait, where are you going?

103
00:15:14,874 --> 00:15:17,900
Well, now that I've got the keys,
I can do some things that need to get done.

104
00:15:18,011 --> 00:15:19,308
Okay.

105
00:15:20,246 --> 00:15:21,440
Oh, no.

106
00:15:40,234 --> 00:15:43,931
- What's with Max today?
- He doesn't like people moving.

107
00:15:44,038 --> 00:15:46,302
He doesn't like people moving out.

108
00:15:48,142 --> 00:15:51,510
- Do boys like Mr. Potato Head?
- I guess.

109
00:16:06,995 --> 00:16:08,758
Come back in, Rose.

110
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,333
I left him a toy.

111
00:16:16,439 --> 00:16:18,566
- Who?
- The boy.

112
00:16:18,674 --> 00:16:21,108
- What boy?
- I think he's new.

113
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:23,610
No, there's no new boys here.

114
00:16:25,381 --> 00:16:27,781
- Where are you going?
- Can't leave a toy in the hall, Rose.

115
00:16:27,884 --> 00:16:30,785
- Max'll have a fit.
- It's for the boy.

116
00:16:36,193 --> 00:16:37,990
Where did you put it?

117
00:16:38,095 --> 00:16:39,995
A toy'll make him feel better.

118
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:58,011
Well, I guess these belong to you.

119
00:16:58,115 --> 00:17:01,847
Yeah. I really wish
I could convince you guys to stay.

120
00:17:01,953 --> 00:17:04,285
- We're gonna miss you around here.
- Well, it's best for Brenda.

121
00:17:04,389 --> 00:17:07,847
She's been having a rough time
since that family died.

122
00:17:09,093 --> 00:17:11,357
A change of scene might help.

123
00:17:11,462 --> 00:17:13,327
Well, if there's ever anything I can do
to help out,

124
00:17:13,431 --> 00:17:17,925
a landlord recommendation
or anything at all, you know who to call.

125
00:17:18,036 --> 00:17:20,334
Tell Lisa and Rose we said bye.

126
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:28,705
Mr. Praski, I didn't know you were
coming by. I was just seeing...

127
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,543
Two more tenants off.

128
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,378
Yeah, they were good ones.

129
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:35,317
- Reporters still hassling you?
- No, sir. I've been keeping them out.

130
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:36,979
Good, good.

131
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,956
Max, there's something we gotta talk about.

132
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,756
I've been riding the contractors
like you said. I'll push them harder.

133
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:47,390
I've been thinking. Maybe it's time
to bring in a management company.

134
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,937
Someone to help put things back on track.
It's nothing personal.

135
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:54,506
I've got some prospects lined up.

136
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:56,734
- And there's a woman coming by.
- Yeah?

137
00:17:56,843 --> 00:17:59,778
Yeah, I mean,
she sounds really eager to rent.

138
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:01,676
Don't let her get away, Max.

139
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:04,272
We got money flowing
in the wrong direction.

140
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:17,393
"You are charming
and wise beyond your years."

141
00:18:18,766 --> 00:18:21,291
That's a compliment, not a fortune.

142
00:18:21,402 --> 00:18:22,835
What's yours say?

143
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:29,174
Tell you what, I'll set up your bed
while you take a bath.

144
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:30,834
How's that sound?

145
00:18:36,718 --> 00:18:39,084
You used to love taking a bath.

146
00:18:39,554 --> 00:18:42,148
Half the water ended up on the floor.

147
00:18:43,592 --> 00:18:47,961
I'll get a towel.
God knows where the mover put the box.

148
00:19:37,581 --> 00:19:38,775
Brenda!

149
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,782
Brenda!

150
00:20:16,122 --> 00:20:18,716
- How do I look?
- Like a crazy guy.

151
00:20:18,824 --> 00:20:22,817
Everything changes today, Rose.
I can feel it. Can you feel it?

152
00:20:22,928 --> 00:20:24,555
I don't feel it.

153
00:20:25,064 --> 00:20:27,499
Come on, don't say that.
You have to think positive.

154
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:28,727
Okay.

155
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,668
- What are you doing?
- Thinking.

156
00:20:32,772 --> 00:20:35,502
Atta girl. Wish me luck.

157
00:20:38,745 --> 00:20:40,235
Good luck!

158
00:20:43,783 --> 00:20:46,308
- You must be Naoko.
- Naoko.

159
00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:50,082
Naoko, sorry. I'm Max.
Glad you made it okay.

160
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,955
- I'm sorry if I kept you waiting.
- No.

161
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:56,587
- Good then. Shall we get started?
- Yes.

162
00:20:56,697 --> 00:20:57,823
Okay.

163
00:21:03,938 --> 00:21:05,428
There is an elevator right there,

164
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,304
but it's old and most tenants
just use the stairs.

165
00:21:08,409 --> 00:21:10,172
More communal.

166
00:21:11,245 --> 00:21:15,410
Yeah, sorry about the mess.
We're in a transitional phase,

167
00:21:15,951 --> 00:21:18,852
as you can see. 303 is down here.

168
00:21:21,123 --> 00:21:25,492
Now this'll all be fresh paint
before you know it. It should be really nice

169
00:21:25,594 --> 00:21:29,462
before you know it.
Really nice. Sorry about the mess.

170
00:21:29,565 --> 00:21:32,898
You know, you're lucky. This is
the first floor to get the makeover treatment.

171
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:36,460
The owner's sinking a lot into restoration.
Every detail.

172
00:21:36,573 --> 00:21:38,006
Here we are.

173
00:21:43,813 --> 00:21:45,405
Okay.

174
00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:50,876
Now, as you can see, sizeable living room,

175
00:21:50,987 --> 00:21:52,579
bright open plan.

176
00:21:52,689 --> 00:21:58,286
In here, we've got the dining room,
kitchen, and even a little sun room there.

177
00:21:59,229 --> 00:22:04,190
- Do you live here, as well?
- Me and the girls. Two sisters.

178
00:22:04,635 --> 00:22:07,763
So I'll be right downstairs
if you need anything.

179
00:22:08,639 --> 00:22:13,042
- How many others in the building?
- It's a quiet building.

180
00:22:13,644 --> 00:22:16,204
There's hardly a peep out of anyone.

181
00:22:20,351 --> 00:22:23,913
Now, there are three bedrooms,
if you wanna follow me.

182
00:22:33,732 --> 00:22:34,756
Hi.

183
00:22:36,968 --> 00:22:39,436
- May I?
- No, you may not.

184
00:22:39,537 --> 00:22:41,368
You need to learn to share.

185
00:22:41,473 --> 00:22:44,840
Guys, this is Naoko, potential neighbor.

186
00:22:44,943 --> 00:22:46,707
Just grabbing an application.

187
00:22:46,812 --> 00:22:51,181
Welcome, potential neighbor.
I'm Lisa, and this is Rose.

188
00:22:51,651 --> 00:22:53,482
Rose. Like the flower.

189
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,782
If you see stuff for Rose sitting outside,
bring it in, okay?

190
00:22:56,889 --> 00:22:58,322
Okay, sorry.

191
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:03,694
- So, where are you moving from?
- I'm from Tokyo.

192
00:23:03,796 --> 00:23:06,287
- Here you go.
- You have a lovely family.

193
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:07,593
Thanks.

194
00:23:55,784 --> 00:23:58,218
- I need that?
- No, ma'am.

195
00:23:58,721 --> 00:24:02,817
The doctor just wanted to make sure
I could read the instructions.

196
00:24:02,925 --> 00:24:04,324
It's okay.

197
00:24:04,426 --> 00:24:07,554
The kids wear these at the hospital
all the time.

198
00:24:10,499 --> 00:24:12,990
Can I breathe underwater with that?

199
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,765
You need a scuba tank for that.

200
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,964
I could go in a shark cage.

201
00:24:18,508 --> 00:24:23,207
You could, but I'd be careful.
Sharks have a taste for little girls.

202
00:24:23,847 --> 00:24:29,217
Look, I'm just gonna put this in the closet,
and we're never gonna talk about it again.

203
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:30,650
Come here.

204
00:24:32,756 --> 00:24:35,850
Things'll get better. I promise.

205
00:24:36,793 --> 00:24:38,488
Not always.

206
00:24:38,661 --> 00:24:42,189
- What do you mean?
- Things don't always get better.

207
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:44,961
Like for those people, the ones that died.

208
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:49,064
That's different. Entirely different.

209
00:24:54,111 --> 00:24:55,738
Do you miss them?

210
00:24:58,582 --> 00:25:00,880
I miss every tenant that leaves.

211
00:25:02,153 --> 00:25:05,817
We take care of everyone here
in our own way.

212
00:25:06,892 --> 00:25:08,416
You take their money.

213
00:25:10,429 --> 00:25:12,363
That's part of our way.

214
00:25:13,231 --> 00:25:15,096
Come here, shark bait.

215
00:25:24,976 --> 00:25:30,005
Showed Rose the oxygen thing.
She wanted to go scuba diving.

216
00:25:31,317 --> 00:25:34,445
- You tell her it was just a precaution?
- Yeah.

217
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:40,357
- So, New York's a crazy place.
- Well, so is Chicago, right?

218
00:25:41,627 --> 00:25:43,254
I just worry, you know.

219
00:25:43,362 --> 00:25:44,920
I'm gonna be fine.

220
00:25:45,031 --> 00:25:47,556
Yeah, but aren't there fashion jobs here?

221
00:25:47,667 --> 00:25:50,135
It's not about the job. It's the internship.

222
00:25:50,236 --> 00:25:52,205
If I could swing a scholarship from this,

223
00:25:52,306 --> 00:25:55,002
then we can use the rest of my college fund
to pay for Rose's medical bills.

224
00:25:55,108 --> 00:25:58,236
- I don't know.
- I'm just trying to help.

225
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:01,546
Look, if you wanna help,
you could stay here.

226
00:26:02,149 --> 00:26:04,208
Okay, put off the internship.

227
00:26:04,318 --> 00:26:06,377
Go when things are stable.

228
00:26:06,787 --> 00:26:09,984
Max, my being here
isn't gonna change anything.

229
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:12,058
We need you, Lisa.

230
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,128
Now is all that matters.

231
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:19,430
Rose is getting worse.
Okay, the building is going to hell.

232
00:26:20,201 --> 00:26:21,930
I may lose my job.

233
00:26:23,505 --> 00:26:25,530
Why didn't you tell me?

234
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,904
Would it have made a difference?

235
00:26:40,022 --> 00:26:43,753
Aunt Diane's been floating the offer
for us to move in.

236
00:26:43,859 --> 00:26:46,692
- With her five cats?
- It's more like eight.

237
00:26:48,063 --> 00:26:52,193
And I know we joke,
but it's now becoming our only option here.

238
00:26:52,301 --> 00:26:54,064
Rose hates it there.

239
00:26:59,008 --> 00:27:00,874
I can't do this alone.

240
00:27:04,648 --> 00:27:08,345
If things work out, I could make us stable.

241
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:16,282
Rose has her check up,

242
00:27:16,393 --> 00:27:19,829
and then I'm taking her to the park
to feed the ducks.

243
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:23,362
You can meet us there later if you like.

244
00:29:09,377 --> 00:29:10,537
Hello?

245
00:29:14,182 --> 00:29:15,308
Hello.

246
00:29:18,086 --> 00:29:20,487
We don't allow reporters in here.

247
00:29:20,589 --> 00:29:24,184
I'm not a reporter.
I have permission from the manager.

248
00:29:24,293 --> 00:29:26,454
The manager's my brother.

249
00:29:26,562 --> 00:29:29,588
You must be Lisa. I'm Dr. Sullivan.

250
00:29:29,699 --> 00:29:32,190
The boy who lived here
was a patient of mine.

251
00:29:32,301 --> 00:29:33,427
Jake.

252
00:29:34,403 --> 00:29:37,338
- How is he?
- I'm sorry, I thought...

253
00:29:38,774 --> 00:29:40,765
Jake passed away.

254
00:29:40,876 --> 00:29:43,539
What? How?

255
00:29:44,414 --> 00:29:48,976
Actually, we're not quite sure,
to be honest with you.

256
00:29:53,323 --> 00:29:57,919
He said a lot of things
about the night that his family died.

257
00:29:58,261 --> 00:30:01,492
So I guess I just wanted
to come and see for myself.

258
00:30:02,432 --> 00:30:05,664
Are there any other boys living
in this building?

259
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:08,066
No, Jake was it.

260
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:09,564
Why?

261
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:14,138
He talked about a boy, seeing a boy here.

262
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:16,480
He was terrified of him.

263
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:19,777
My sister saw a boy recently.

264
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:21,374
Here?

265
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:23,880
Maybe I could talk with her?

266
00:30:24,922 --> 00:30:28,484
She isn't really a fan of doctors
to tell you the truth.

267
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:33,756
So, Jake...

268
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:35,891
How long ago?

269
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:37,468
Not long.

270
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:40,936
The service is tomorrow. At Lakemore.

271
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,904
Hey, there you are.

272
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:45,977
This was the last place I thought you'd be.

273
00:30:46,078 --> 00:30:47,511
Andy.

274
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,309
- How you doing?
- Andy.

275
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:52,179
This is Dr. Sullivan.

276
00:30:54,587 --> 00:30:56,020
Hi.

277
00:30:56,856 --> 00:31:00,587
Hey, if you're thinking of renting, this is a...
You know, it's a good place.

278
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:04,288
- Good people.
- She was Jake's doctor, Andy. He died.

279
00:31:05,398 --> 00:31:06,729
Shit.

280
00:31:08,902 --> 00:31:10,301
I'm sorry.

281
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:13,471
- I thought you were just here...
- It was nice meeting you.

282
00:31:13,573 --> 00:31:15,201
Nice to meet you.

283
00:31:19,547 --> 00:31:22,414
- You ass.
- How was I supposed to know?

284
00:31:22,883 --> 00:31:26,785
Anyway, I thought that kid survived
that whole thing.

285
00:31:27,087 --> 00:31:28,384
- What happened to him?
- She didn't say.

286
00:31:28,489 --> 00:31:31,754
- I don't want to think about it.
- Wait, wait, wait.

287
00:31:32,393 --> 00:31:34,827
I've got some time before work.

288
00:31:34,929 --> 00:31:37,489
- You are unbelievable.
- What?

289
00:31:39,267 --> 00:31:40,928
Not on this floor.

290
00:31:41,837 --> 00:31:43,600
Then... Then where?

291
00:31:45,307 --> 00:31:48,140
There's an empty on four,
but I'd have to go sneak the keys.

292
00:31:48,243 --> 00:31:52,373
Okay, so grab the keys,
and I'll meet you on four.

293
00:31:54,883 --> 00:31:56,009
Fine.

294
00:32:03,459 --> 00:32:04,585
Okay.

295
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:16,501
Busted.

296
00:32:17,306 --> 00:32:20,275
Rose, will you go to your room
for me, please?

297
00:32:25,182 --> 00:32:29,619
Lisa, we talked about this.
I can't watch Rose and you.

298
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,518
- I don't need to be watched.
- Of course not.

299
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:35,757
Come on, Max, give me a break.

300
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:39,688
I'll give you a break
when you start acting like an adult.

301
00:32:41,164 --> 00:32:42,995
Fine. Whatever.

302
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,398
I won't be your problem
much longer anyway.

303
00:32:45,502 --> 00:32:49,405
Is that how you see it?
Or is it that we won't be your problem?

304
00:33:17,703 --> 00:33:19,034
Oh, my God.

305
00:33:20,472 --> 00:33:22,633
You scared the shit out of me.

306
00:33:27,579 --> 00:33:29,672
What are you doing up there?

307
00:33:58,612 --> 00:34:01,513
Hey, you coming up or what?

308
00:37:30,133 --> 00:37:32,067
You could have come inside.

309
00:37:32,168 --> 00:37:34,500
I didn't really feel comfortable.

310
00:37:34,604 --> 00:37:38,563
Well, I've always found funerals
more for closure than comfort.

311
00:37:39,209 --> 00:37:41,200
Hey, there's something I wanted to ask you.

312
00:37:41,311 --> 00:37:43,245
Yeah, sure, what is it?

313
00:37:44,547 --> 00:37:46,879
The boy that Jake talked about.

314
00:37:48,285 --> 00:37:52,346
- Did he ever describe him?
- Why? Did your sister see him again?

315
00:37:52,456 --> 00:37:55,584
No. Actually, I think I might have.

316
00:37:57,962 --> 00:38:00,055
Why was he so afraid of him?

317
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:04,592
I never fully understood.

318
00:38:05,069 --> 00:38:07,765
The boy played a role
in the alternate theory Jake created

319
00:38:07,871 --> 00:38:10,841
in order to deal with the death of his family.

320
00:38:14,446 --> 00:38:17,210
There's something at my office
that I'd like you to see.

321
00:38:17,315 --> 00:38:20,182
It may help answer questions for both of us.

322
00:38:21,219 --> 00:38:24,347
And I can drive you back home if you like.

323
00:38:25,523 --> 00:38:28,583
- Okay.
- Okay, good. I'm just right here.

324
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,548
And now you can go around there.

325
00:38:55,221 --> 00:38:56,688
There you go.

326
00:39:04,898 --> 00:39:06,889
You shouldn't be up there.

327
00:39:07,668 --> 00:39:10,330
You should be down here
doing your homework.

328
00:39:41,569 --> 00:39:42,627
Max.

329
00:39:43,472 --> 00:39:44,598
Rose?

330
00:39:47,743 --> 00:39:50,405
Rose? Come here. It's all right.

331
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,940
Hang on.

332
00:39:57,886 --> 00:39:59,285
Hang on, Rose.

333
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:10,925
Hang on. I got you. I got you, babe.
Okay, here we go. Come on.

334
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:18,898
The woman's name is Kayako Saeki,

335
00:40:19,008 --> 00:40:22,000
and the father is Takeo,
and the boy is Toshio.

336
00:40:23,847 --> 00:40:25,940
That's him. That's the boy.

337
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:31,047
Maybe they knew Jake from somewhere?

338
00:40:31,155 --> 00:40:33,817
Did they say anything?
Did you talk to them?

339
00:40:35,793 --> 00:40:37,260
They're dead.

340
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:40,756
Dead?

341
00:40:42,166 --> 00:40:44,191
It happened in Japan.

342
00:40:44,301 --> 00:40:45,734
Years ago.

343
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:49,871
Father murdered his wife and son
before hanging himself.

344
00:40:53,545 --> 00:40:57,208
Did you know a girl named Allison Fleming
who lived in your building,

345
00:40:57,315 --> 00:40:58,509
the one who went missing?

346
00:40:58,617 --> 00:41:01,552
Not really. She was always away at school.

347
00:41:03,388 --> 00:41:05,618
Jake thought she brought
something back with her,

348
00:41:05,724 --> 00:41:08,158
something dark that changed her.

349
00:41:08,827 --> 00:41:12,024
Allison visited the house
where the Saeki family died.

350
00:41:15,968 --> 00:41:17,492
I wanna show you something.

351
00:41:21,407 --> 00:41:24,240
This is footage
from my very first session with Jake.

352
00:41:24,343 --> 00:41:27,403
At the time,
his stepmother was the primary suspect.

353
00:41:27,513 --> 00:41:31,244
My job was to evaluate his mental condition.

354
00:41:32,018 --> 00:41:34,179
<i>I'm not making it up.</i>

355
00:41:34,287 --> 00:41:36,278
<i>I don't believe you, Jake.</i>

356
00:41:36,389 --> 00:41:37,879
<i>I'm not lying.</i>

357
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:41,855
<i>You see her when no one else is around.</i>

358
00:41:43,397 --> 00:41:44,762
<i>She's real.</i>

359
00:41:44,865 --> 00:41:46,662
<i>Well, I don't see her.</i>

360
00:41:47,768 --> 00:41:50,259
<i>- She's real.
- Describe her again.</i>

361
00:41:53,574 --> 00:41:59,376
<i>She... She has black hair,
and it hangs over her face.</i>

362
00:42:02,183 --> 00:42:07,985
<i>All over, on her body, there's...</i>

363
00:42:11,593 --> 00:42:13,220
<i>There's blood.</i>

364
00:42:14,796 --> 00:42:17,162
<i>There's blood all over her body?</i>

365
00:42:18,099 --> 00:42:21,159
<i>And it's like she's dead.</i>

366
00:42:24,672 --> 00:42:28,700
I reasoned he'd witnessed
his stepmother kill his sister and father.

367
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,511
Unable to cope with what he saw,

368
00:42:32,615 --> 00:42:36,517
he invented these gruesome ideations
of a boy and a woman

369
00:42:37,219 --> 00:42:40,017
in order to disassociate himself
from the truth.

370
00:42:40,122 --> 00:42:42,113
But I saw the boy myself.

371
00:42:45,127 --> 00:42:46,617
Yeah, I was wrong.

372
00:42:48,331 --> 00:42:50,424
Unimaginably wrong.

373
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:57,636
You never told me how he died.

374
00:42:59,342 --> 00:43:03,142
Our surveillance system shows him
reacting to a hallucination.

375
00:43:04,614 --> 00:43:09,108
Only somehow that hallucination
broke nearly every bone in his body.

376
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:27,595
Max?

377
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:31,468
- Where have you been?
- I was with Andy.

378
00:43:31,876 --> 00:43:33,673
Rose was in the hospital.

379
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:35,041
What?

380
00:43:35,847 --> 00:43:37,212
Oh, my God.

381
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:39,644
Why?

382
00:43:41,386 --> 00:43:43,946
Doctor said she overexerted herself.

383
00:43:44,089 --> 00:43:46,216
- Doing what?
- I don't know.

384
00:43:46,792 --> 00:43:48,191
She was playing.

385
00:43:49,761 --> 00:43:52,025
I told you she's getting worse.

386
00:43:52,731 --> 00:43:54,665
Yeah, but I thought the new medicine
was supposed to help...

387
00:43:54,766 --> 00:43:56,495
It's not enough.

388
00:43:56,602 --> 00:43:59,663
She may have to start wearing
the oxygen thing.

389
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:05,167
I guess I'll keep you updated
when you're gone.

390
00:44:05,278 --> 00:44:08,338
I'll be calling. Every day.

391
00:44:09,649 --> 00:44:11,640
It's better than nothing.

392
00:44:12,952 --> 00:44:14,920
Why don't you tuck her in?

393
00:44:15,021 --> 00:44:17,319
Make the most of your last day?

394
00:44:24,164 --> 00:44:26,359
Hey, Rose. How you doing?

395
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,835
- Don't stop.
- I know.

396
00:44:35,943 --> 00:44:37,706
Until you're asleep.

397
00:44:47,288 --> 00:44:50,018
I love you. You know that?

398
00:46:18,717 --> 00:46:21,515
Rose? Rose, what's wrong?

399
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:24,020
- What is it, Rose?
- The boy, he's here.

400
00:46:24,123 --> 00:46:25,886
- Where?
- In my room.

401
00:46:33,298 --> 00:46:34,390
No.

402
00:46:36,034 --> 00:46:37,092
No.

403
00:46:46,146 --> 00:46:48,080
There's nothing there.

404
00:46:51,184 --> 00:46:53,709
You wanna sleep in my room tonight?

405
00:46:54,521 --> 00:46:55,647
Okay.

406
00:49:14,266 --> 00:49:16,996
Ben! Ben, open the door!

407
00:49:17,102 --> 00:49:21,130
Ben, help me! Open the door, please!

408
00:49:21,241 --> 00:49:25,871
Ben! Please, help me! Help me, Ben!

409
00:49:36,856 --> 00:49:39,324
Can I go play in the snow
when we get there?

410
00:49:39,426 --> 00:49:41,553
Sorry, the snow's all gone.

411
00:49:41,995 --> 00:49:44,931
Let's get you buttoned up, though. Let's go.

412
00:49:49,971 --> 00:49:52,462
Hi. Naoko, right?

413
00:49:53,641 --> 00:49:56,075
I was wondering if we could talk.

414
00:49:56,811 --> 00:50:00,577
Yeah, we were just about to go to the park
if you want to come.

415
00:50:00,715 --> 00:50:03,479
- Yes, I would like that.
- Okay.

416
00:50:09,057 --> 00:50:12,026
It's easy sometimes to forget
how sick she is.

417
00:50:12,427 --> 00:50:16,193
I understand. On the outside, she is okay,

418
00:50:17,366 --> 00:50:20,267
but on the inside, things are getting worse.

419
00:50:22,971 --> 00:50:27,499
It may sound strange
but a place can get sick the same way.

420
00:50:28,977 --> 00:50:30,502
I don't follow.

421
00:50:32,582 --> 00:50:35,244
I know what happened in your building.

422
00:50:37,487 --> 00:50:39,785
Guess you changed your mind
about moving in?

423
00:50:39,889 --> 00:50:40,913
No.

424
00:50:41,024 --> 00:50:44,460
What happened in your building
is the reason I'm here.

425
00:51:22,367 --> 00:51:23,425
Shit.

426
00:51:24,803 --> 00:51:30,139
In Japan, there is another place,
sick because of what happened inside.

427
00:51:31,309 --> 00:51:32,799
What happened?

428
00:51:33,545 --> 00:51:38,039
A husband killed his wife and only child,
then himself.

429
00:51:39,484 --> 00:51:43,080
An evil started with their deaths
but has spread.

430
00:51:43,889 --> 00:51:48,349
Now it gathers here in your building.

431
00:51:51,363 --> 00:51:54,355
- Can I go play on the swings?
- Yeah, go ahead.

432
00:51:58,838 --> 00:52:00,203
Who are you?

433
00:52:01,907 --> 00:52:03,876
The woman who was killed,

434
00:52:05,145 --> 00:52:07,875
she was my sister, Kayako.

435
00:53:07,109 --> 00:53:09,270
Kayako and I had a difficult life.

436
00:53:11,046 --> 00:53:15,814
<i>Our mother was an itako,
someone who can commune with the dead.</i>

437
00:53:18,688 --> 00:53:23,455
<i>From the time we were very young,
our mother taught us the old ways.</i>

438
00:53:24,594 --> 00:53:26,994
For me it was frightening.

439
00:53:28,398 --> 00:53:31,925
<i>For my sister, it was a nightmare.</i>

440
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:36,631
<i>Those possessed came to my mother
to be healed.</i>

441
00:53:38,042 --> 00:53:42,672
<i>My mother took the evil from them
and fed the spirits to Kayako.</i>

442
00:53:44,014 --> 00:53:45,606
<i>It silenced them,</i>

443
00:53:46,283 --> 00:53:48,717
but my sister was changed forever.

444
00:54:08,974 --> 00:54:11,966
Gretchen? Got a spill out here.

445
00:54:18,116 --> 00:54:19,378
Gretchen?

446
00:54:41,374 --> 00:54:42,602
Gretchen?

447
00:54:51,151 --> 00:54:52,448
Gretchen?

448
00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:13,236
<i>When my sister was killed, a ju-on was born.</i>

449
00:55:15,109 --> 00:55:17,942
In English, it is something like a curse.

450
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:22,138
- And now you think the curse is here?
- I am sure of it.

451
00:55:22,884 --> 00:55:25,182
Well, then why would you come here?

452
00:55:25,286 --> 00:55:28,084
- To put an end to it.
- How?

453
00:55:28,756 --> 00:55:32,818
A simple ceremony in the place
where the curse was reborn.

454
00:55:33,529 --> 00:55:35,053
The boy's home.

455
00:55:36,065 --> 00:55:39,330
But I cannot do it alone. I need you.

456
00:55:41,036 --> 00:55:43,061
You and Rose.

457
00:55:44,139 --> 00:55:48,337
Okay, look, I'm really sorry
for what you've been through. I am.

458
00:55:48,444 --> 00:55:50,275
And I believe that you want to help,

459
00:55:50,379 --> 00:55:53,712
but this ceremony or whatever,
we can't be a part of it.

460
00:55:53,816 --> 00:55:57,014
If the curse is not stopped,
more people will die.

461
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,452
- You must understand.
- I'm sorry.

462
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:06,857
Come on, Rose. Time to go. Let's go.

463
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:16,203
Let's go home now. Get some lunch, yeah?

464
00:56:17,241 --> 00:56:19,869
- Max. Hey, we need to talk.
- Get Rose out of here.

465
00:56:19,977 --> 00:56:21,945
- Why? What's going on?
- Just do it.

466
00:56:22,046 --> 00:56:23,104
Okay.

467
00:56:34,425 --> 00:56:35,892
What happened?

468
00:56:39,764 --> 00:56:40,993
Max.

469
00:56:43,068 --> 00:56:44,626
Are you okay?

470
00:56:48,006 --> 00:56:51,066
Look, I think we might
need to get out of here.

471
00:56:52,077 --> 00:56:54,102
I talked with Naoko today.

472
00:56:54,746 --> 00:56:57,146
- Wait, you talked to Naoko?
- Yeah.

473
00:56:57,749 --> 00:57:00,115
She thinks we might be in danger.

474
00:57:01,353 --> 00:57:02,752
That's nice.

475
00:57:03,589 --> 00:57:05,420
She doesn't have time
to sign her credit application

476
00:57:05,525 --> 00:57:07,755
but she's got time to tell you
that we're in danger?

477
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:11,455
Are you even listening to me?
I'm saying that I'm worried.

478
00:57:12,532 --> 00:57:15,092
What have you got to be worried about?

479
00:57:15,301 --> 00:57:18,828
You're out of here soon.
It's not your problem now, is it?

480
00:57:25,845 --> 00:57:28,144
<i>Miss Saeki is not answering in her room.</i>

481
00:57:28,248 --> 00:57:31,274
<i>We'll leave a message for her
at the front desk.</i>

482
00:57:47,201 --> 00:57:51,070
- This is what you wanted.
- Yeah, I did. I do.

483
00:57:52,207 --> 00:57:54,698
Do you want to tell me what changed?

484
00:57:55,009 --> 00:57:57,910
- Andy...
- You said it yourself, Lisa.

485
00:57:58,012 --> 00:58:01,641
If things work out in New York,
it's only gonna help Rose.

486
00:58:02,183 --> 00:58:04,879
- It's just with...
- What? Gretchen dying?

487
00:58:05,386 --> 00:58:06,614
Yeah.

488
00:58:06,721 --> 00:58:10,350
- Yeah. She was a nice lady.
- You don't think it's strange?

489
00:58:10,859 --> 00:58:13,124
What? All those people dying?

490
00:58:14,029 --> 00:58:16,429
Yeah, it's a tragedy. But...

491
00:58:19,001 --> 00:58:21,561
You can't let it stop you from living.

492
00:58:22,972 --> 00:58:24,701
I mean, it's over.

493
00:58:24,807 --> 00:58:27,571
- I'm not so sure that's true.
- Thanks.

494
00:58:32,915 --> 00:58:37,819
Look, the thing with that kid,
it's creepy, yeah.

495
00:58:38,889 --> 00:58:41,722
Scary? Okay, maybe.

496
00:58:42,993 --> 00:58:46,793
- But real? No way.
- You don't know that.

497
00:58:48,164 --> 00:58:50,359
You're just seeing connections
you want to see.

498
00:58:50,467 --> 00:58:53,095
It all leads back to those murders in Japan.
It's all connected.

499
00:58:53,203 --> 00:58:56,570
- Lisa, like, please.
- You're not even listening to me.

500
00:58:57,474 --> 00:59:00,638
You know what?
You're just anxious about leaving.

501
00:59:01,345 --> 00:59:03,370
All right? And I get that.

502
00:59:04,415 --> 00:59:07,111
Hey, we're doing this together, though.

503
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:12,753
I'm not going to New York, Andy.

504
00:59:15,693 --> 00:59:18,127
I'm sorry, but my family needs me.

505
00:59:21,799 --> 00:59:23,995
- What? Just like that?
- Sorry.

506
00:59:28,473 --> 00:59:31,340
Okay. Okay.

507
00:59:32,978 --> 00:59:36,812
If you're not going, I'm not going.

508
00:59:37,683 --> 00:59:40,117
There's no reason for you to stay.

509
00:59:45,525 --> 00:59:47,425
How could you say that?

510
00:59:50,196 --> 00:59:56,294
Lisa, the reason I'm staying is
the same reason why I was going.

511
00:59:57,904 --> 00:59:58,996
You.

512
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:53,325
Where's Max?

513
01:00:55,031 --> 01:00:58,057
- Rose, where is he?
- He said he had to work.

514
01:00:59,068 --> 01:01:00,933
He left you here alone?

515
01:01:02,538 --> 01:01:04,438
When is he coming back?

516
01:01:06,575 --> 01:01:08,304
Have you eaten anything?

517
01:01:08,411 --> 01:01:10,436
I'm gonna make you something to eat.
How does that sound?

518
01:01:10,546 --> 01:01:11,638
Okay.

519
01:01:13,649 --> 01:01:17,176
- Can you believe this?
- Do you want me to stay here?

520
01:01:17,286 --> 01:01:18,686
I can just call in sick.

521
01:01:18,789 --> 01:01:21,257
It's not like they're expecting me to work
on my last day anyway.

522
01:01:21,358 --> 01:01:23,383
No, it's okay. You should go.

523
01:01:23,493 --> 01:01:26,860
I mean, if we're not going to New York,
you might as well keep your job.

524
01:01:26,963 --> 01:01:30,126
Anyway, I'm here.
I'm gonna make her some dinner.

525
01:01:30,867 --> 01:01:32,732
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

526
01:01:33,470 --> 01:01:36,769
Okay. I'll give you a call when I'm off work.

527
01:01:38,608 --> 01:01:39,973
I love you.

528
01:01:54,859 --> 01:01:56,417
I love you, too.

529
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:03,959
Bye.

530
01:02:07,239 --> 01:02:08,501
See you.

531
01:02:11,677 --> 01:02:12,735
Okay.

532
01:02:27,025 --> 01:02:28,084
Hey.

533
01:02:34,634 --> 01:02:35,692
Hey.

534
01:02:55,689 --> 01:02:56,747
Fuck.

535
01:03:42,171 --> 01:03:44,469
You don't have to pick that stuff up
by yourself.

536
01:03:44,574 --> 01:03:49,011
I'll get somebody in here to clean it out
when things get back to normal.

537
01:03:53,115 --> 01:03:56,107
I've been over this, trying to make it work,

538
01:03:56,219 --> 01:03:58,312
but I gotta switch things up.

539
01:03:59,756 --> 01:04:02,623
I'm going with
the management company option.

540
01:04:03,527 --> 01:04:05,927
They start the first of the month.

541
01:04:09,233 --> 01:04:11,030
You can stay, of course,

542
01:04:11,134 --> 01:04:14,035
but you gotta pay rent like everybody else.

543
01:04:15,138 --> 01:04:17,538
Might be temporary. Who knows?

544
01:04:17,641 --> 01:04:20,439
What am I supposed to do now, Mr. Praski?

545
01:04:20,844 --> 01:04:25,214
- How am I gonna take care of my family?
- Listen, business is business, kid.

546
01:04:25,316 --> 01:04:28,717
Then fuck business, and fuck you.

547
01:04:28,987 --> 01:04:33,014
Look, you don't gotta like the news, kid,
you just gotta take it.

548
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:45,098
It didn't have to be like this.

549
01:06:44,094 --> 01:06:46,085
Where were you last night?

550
01:06:47,464 --> 01:06:50,490
Manual labor. It's a bitch.

551
01:06:51,201 --> 01:06:52,930
You left Rose alone.

552
01:06:54,204 --> 01:06:57,799
- She can't be alone ever.
- I know that.

553
01:06:58,842 --> 01:07:02,539
But I don't have Gretchen
to count on anymore, now, do I?

554
01:07:02,646 --> 01:07:06,481
Listen, things are happening
and I think we should leave.

555
01:07:07,318 --> 01:07:09,946
You're always making plans now,
aren't you?

556
01:07:10,055 --> 01:07:11,750
I don't understand.

557
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:15,016
People are dying
and you're acting like nothing is happening.

558
01:07:15,126 --> 01:07:19,586
How do you want me to act, Lisa?
Gretchen was old. Old people die.

559
01:07:20,465 --> 01:07:22,695
Is that what you said to Rose?

560
01:07:23,601 --> 01:07:27,663
I have been saddled with Rose
since Mom and Dad died. Not you, me.

561
01:07:28,374 --> 01:07:30,308
She is not your problem!

562
01:07:31,410 --> 01:07:33,310
What is wrong with you?

563
01:07:33,712 --> 01:07:36,203
Not a goddamn thing, that's what.

564
01:07:36,582 --> 01:07:38,049
I'm young, healthy.

565
01:07:38,150 --> 01:07:41,551
I got all the time in the world
since I was just fired.

566
01:07:42,421 --> 01:07:44,355
Yeah, what, are you surprised?

567
01:07:44,457 --> 01:07:46,584
Surprised that I couldn't manage
a full-time job

568
01:07:46,692 --> 01:07:48,956
while raising a chronically sick 8-year-old?

569
01:07:49,061 --> 01:07:50,927
You should have said something.

570
01:07:51,031 --> 01:07:55,263
Gee, I wish I had. Wait, I did,

571
01:07:55,368 --> 01:07:59,361
but you were too busy fucking Andy all over
the goddamn building to listen to me.

572
01:07:59,473 --> 01:08:03,000
Max, please, can we just all go?
I mean, if we don't have to be here.

573
01:08:03,110 --> 01:08:08,173
We're not going anywhere, sis.
But you, maybe it's time you go.

574
01:08:09,249 --> 01:08:12,514
Max, what are you talking about?
What are you doing?

575
01:08:12,619 --> 01:08:14,019
Max!

576
01:08:15,356 --> 01:08:18,223
Stop. Max! What are you doing?

577
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:23,058
Max! Stop! Let me in! You can't lock me out!

578
01:08:23,164 --> 01:08:27,498
No, Max. You can't lock me out. Stop.

579
01:08:56,565 --> 01:08:59,193
- What's going on?
- Go to your room.

580
01:09:00,436 --> 01:09:04,930
- Where's Lisa?
- Go to your fucking room.

581
01:09:31,635 --> 01:09:34,866
<i>- Cademan Clinic.
- Dr. Sullivan, please?</i>

582
01:09:35,372 --> 01:09:38,808
<i>- She's not available.
- Can I leave a message for her?</i>

583
01:09:39,610 --> 01:09:42,477
<i>I'm sorry, but there's been an incident
here at the clinic.</i>

584
01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:45,105
<i>- Excuse me?
- Dr. Sullivan...</i>

585
01:09:46,050 --> 01:09:49,077
<i>- Dr. Sullivan has passed away.
- What?</i>

586
01:09:52,857 --> 01:09:54,654
<i>Dr. Sullivan is dead.</i>

587
01:10:32,699 --> 01:10:35,964
I'm sorry. I didn't know where else to go.

588
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:48,504
We'll leave, then.

589
01:10:48,615 --> 01:10:52,745
We'll leave. I'll go get Max and Rose
and we won't come back.

590
01:10:52,853 --> 01:10:56,051
It's too late. It is a part of you now

591
01:10:57,625 --> 01:10:59,650
and only a matter of time.

592
01:11:01,763 --> 01:11:03,230
Before I die?

593
01:11:09,003 --> 01:11:10,937
And Rose? Max?

594
01:11:13,107 --> 01:11:14,404
Everyone.

595
01:11:19,782 --> 01:11:22,148
Your sister, where is she?

596
01:11:24,119 --> 01:11:25,643
She's with Max.

597
01:11:28,390 --> 01:11:30,790
You said he was angry, aggressive.

598
01:11:32,628 --> 01:11:36,086
He was. I mean, he is.

599
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:40,095
You cannot leave her with him.

600
01:11:41,170 --> 01:11:43,162
Max would never hurt Rose.

601
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:47,872
A great fury is at work.
It has hold over your brother.

602
01:11:48,478 --> 01:11:51,242
I don't believe that. He loves her.

603
01:11:52,816 --> 01:11:54,875
Max may not be Max anymore.

604
01:11:58,021 --> 01:12:01,787
I can help Rose but I need her to be with us.

605
01:12:04,561 --> 01:12:06,655
He'll never let that happen.

606
01:12:07,298 --> 01:12:09,994
Then we cannot let that decision be his.

607
01:12:11,769 --> 01:12:12,861
Okay.

608
01:12:20,845 --> 01:12:22,642
All right, wait here.

609
01:12:41,767 --> 01:12:42,825
Rose.

610
01:12:47,072 --> 01:12:48,801
Rose. Come on.

611
01:13:11,097 --> 01:13:12,189
Come.

612
01:13:28,015 --> 01:13:30,074
Rose. Come.

613
01:13:48,937 --> 01:13:50,598
Okay. Now what?

614
01:13:52,373 --> 01:13:53,601
It's time.

615
01:14:03,986 --> 01:14:06,011
No matter what you hear,

616
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:12,828
no matter what you see,

617
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:20,100
you must not interfere.

618
01:14:33,450 --> 01:14:37,147
It's okay, Rose. It's like a prayer.
I'm right here.

619
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:35,570
What was that?

620
01:15:52,832 --> 01:15:53,992
The blood of my sister.

621
01:15:58,505 --> 01:16:01,235
- What are you doing?
- She needs to drink.

622
01:16:01,842 --> 01:16:03,605
- Drink what?
- Please, it won't hurt.

623
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:07,704
- You didn't say anything about this.
- We are running out of time.

624
01:16:08,549 --> 01:16:10,676
The curse must be contained.

625
01:16:26,034 --> 01:16:28,332
Please, Rose, you can end it.

626
01:16:28,436 --> 01:16:31,633
- You can make the bad go away.
- Come on, Rose. Let's go.

627
01:16:32,407 --> 01:16:33,601
Come on.

628
01:16:35,877 --> 01:16:36,935
Max.

629
01:17:12,883 --> 01:17:14,783
Please, don't do this.

630
01:17:22,759 --> 01:17:26,058
You have to understand.
There has been so much death.

631
01:17:33,905 --> 01:17:36,135
Max, no.

632
01:17:37,241 --> 01:17:40,836
Hurting me won't help.
I mean no harm to Rose.

633
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:45,012
The curse is doing this to you.

634
01:19:25,488 --> 01:19:26,978
Leave us alone.

635
01:20:01,959 --> 01:20:04,018
Come on, Rose. What is it?

636
01:20:19,043 --> 01:20:24,208
No, no, no, no, no.

637
01:21:29,917 --> 01:21:31,009
Rose.

638
01:21:35,823 --> 01:21:38,656
Rose? Rose?

639
01:21:39,994 --> 01:21:43,726
Oh, God, Rose, what did you do?
What did you do?

640
01:21:45,767 --> 01:21:47,166
Okay, come on.

641
01:21:52,107 --> 01:21:53,165
Max.

642
01:22:01,683 --> 01:22:02,911
Oh, God.

643
01:22:04,152 --> 01:22:05,619
No, Max.

644
01:22:10,927 --> 01:22:11,985
Max.

645
01:22:27,110 --> 01:22:30,638
Rose needs help, okay?
You have to help her, please.

646
01:22:31,815 --> 01:22:32,873
Max!

647
01:22:35,085 --> 01:22:38,350
Please. Max, please, we need you!

648
01:22:42,026 --> 01:22:44,051
Come on, Rose. Help me out.

649
01:23:01,713 --> 01:23:03,442
Stay with me, Rose.

650
01:23:14,025 --> 01:23:16,893
Rose, stay with me. Please.

651
01:23:24,403 --> 01:23:28,305
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe, Rose.

652
01:23:31,911 --> 01:23:33,640
Are you okay?

653
01:23:35,815 --> 01:23:40,014
Okay. Okay. All right.

654
01:23:40,921 --> 01:23:42,445
Are you okay?

655
01:23:47,461 --> 01:23:52,057
It's gonna be okay now, all right?
It's gonna be okay.

656
01:24:41,650 --> 01:24:42,617
What the...

657
01:25:07,210 --> 01:25:08,734
No. No.

658
01:25:15,452 --> 01:25:19,013
Max? Rose, I have to go.

659
01:25:19,690 --> 01:25:21,851
Here, this is gonna be here
if you need it, all right?

660
01:25:21,959 --> 01:25:26,089
But just rest. You're okay now.
Just rest, all right? I'll be back.

661
01:25:44,282 --> 01:25:45,340
Max?

662
01:26:21,588 --> 01:26:24,751
We're gonna ride together in the ambulance.
Okay?

663
01:26:25,859 --> 01:26:29,522
- I'll be with you the whole time.
- I'm scared.

664
01:26:32,432 --> 01:26:34,400
I'm not gonna leave you.

665
01:26:35,535 --> 01:26:39,699
Everything's gonna be okay.
Nothing can hurt us anymore.

666
01:26:41,608 --> 01:26:42,939
All right?

667
01:26:46,914 --> 01:26:49,041
As long as we stay together,

668
01:26:50,585 --> 01:26:52,815
everything will be all right.

669
01:26:55,123 --> 01:26:58,957
Okay? We just gotta stick together.
