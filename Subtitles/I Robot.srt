2
00:03:12,213 --> 00:03:14,172
Thing of beauty.

3
00:03:19,178 --> 00:03:21,346
Good morning, sir.

4
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:24,182
Yet another
on-time delivery from --

5
00:03:24,267 --> 00:03:27,352
Get the hell
out of my face, canner.

6
00:03:27,437 --> 00:03:29,563
Have a nice day.

7
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:36,445
And we believe our
"Destination Anywhere" package
to be the best value.

8
00:03:36,529 --> 00:03:40,949
Let us take you to your dream destination
aboard our orbital space-plane --

9
00:03:51,711 --> 00:03:55,422
Glowfish.
The world's hot-selling transgenic treat.

10
00:04:00,887 --> 00:04:02,804
Excuse me, sir.

11
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:05,557
Total readiness. Total security.

12
00:04:05,641 --> 00:04:09,061
So good-bye to lengthy upgrades
and service calls.

13
00:04:09,145 --> 00:04:12,147
An uplink to U.S.R.'s central computer
provides this state-of-the-art robot ...

14
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:14,149
with new programs daily.

15
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:17,277
The Nestor Class 5
is tomorrow's robot today.

16
00:04:17,362 --> 00:04:21,448
Spoon! Spoonie!

17
00:04:21,532 --> 00:04:23,784
Hey!

18
00:04:23,868 --> 00:04:27,329
Uh -- Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

19
00:04:27,413 --> 00:04:29,581
- Hey, man!
- Spoon, man, where you been at?

20
00:04:29,665 --> 00:04:31,583
-Just away, Farber.
- Oh, yeah, away?

21
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:33,710
Like vacation and stuff?
That's real nice, man.

22
00:04:33,795 --> 00:04:37,130
Listen. I got a favor to ask.
I need to borrow the car for 10, 15 minutes.

23
00:04:37,215 --> 00:04:40,842
No, this is different, Spoon.
Listen. I got this fine-ass little yummy.

24
00:04:40,927 --> 00:04:44,096
I mean, she is complete and agreeable.
I mean, ass-hot spankable, Spoon.

25
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,139
- What does that even mean?
- You know what it means, man.

26
00:04:46,224 --> 00:04:49,351
- Okay? Now stop barricading.
Let me get the damn-ass keys.
- First of all ...

27
00:04:49,435 --> 00:04:51,812
stop cussing, 'cause
you're not good at it.

28
00:04:51,896 --> 00:04:53,897
Let me get 10 for the bus then, man.
I've been there for you.

29
00:04:53,981 --> 00:04:58,110
- Go home.
- Okay, that's strike one, Spoon.
That's strike one.

30
00:05:17,713 --> 00:05:20,298
You talk to Marci?

31
00:05:20,383 --> 00:05:24,386
No, Gigi, I haven't talked to Marci.

32
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:28,223
When I was coming up,
we didn't just marry someone ...

33
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:30,559
then divorce them
then not talk to them.

34
00:05:30,643 --> 00:05:33,186
Del, don't play with me.

35
00:05:33,271 --> 00:05:37,607
I'll bet if I stopped cooking,
you'd call Marci.

36
00:05:37,692 --> 00:05:41,695
Boy, what is that on your feet?

37
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:45,532
Mm. Converse All-Stars,
vintage 2004.

38
00:05:45,616 --> 00:05:47,826
Don't turn your face up like that.

39
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:50,162
I know you want some.
All you gotta do is ask.

40
00:05:50,246 --> 00:05:52,664
No, thank you very much.

41
00:05:52,748 --> 00:05:55,834
- Sweet potato pie.
- Put that on a plate.

42
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:01,423
You know, I've seen on TV, they're giving away
some of them new robots in the lottery.

43
00:06:01,507 --> 00:06:04,134
You know, Gigi ...

44
00:06:04,218 --> 00:06:06,845
those robots don't do
anybody any good.

45
00:06:06,929 --> 00:06:10,056
Of all the people on God's earth,
you should know better.

46
00:06:10,141 --> 00:06:12,767
Sometimes the stuff that comes
out of your mouth.

47
00:06:12,852 --> 00:06:16,354
You listening to me, Del?

48
00:06:28,534 --> 00:06:31,328
Hey! Hey!

49
00:06:34,499 --> 00:06:36,500
Hold my pie.

50
00:06:36,584 --> 00:06:38,960
Sir, hold it or wear it.

51
00:06:42,965 --> 00:06:45,550
Hey! Move!

52
00:06:50,848 --> 00:06:54,726
Hey, hey, thief!

53
00:06:58,648 --> 00:07:11,284
Stop!

54
00:07:15,998 --> 00:07:18,208
I said stop.

55
00:07:18,292 --> 00:07:22,295
Relax. Relax.

56
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:26,049
- I'm a police officer.
- You ...

57
00:07:26,133 --> 00:07:28,510
are an asshole.

58
00:07:28,594 --> 00:07:31,388
Ma'am, is that your purse?

59
00:07:31,472 --> 00:07:34,391
Of course it's my purse.
I left my inhaler at home.

60
00:07:34,475 --> 00:07:36,685
He was running it out to me.

61
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:39,396
I saw a robot running with a purse,
and naturally I-I assumed --

62
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,856
What? Are you crazy?

63
00:07:41,941 --> 00:07:44,359
I'm sorry for this
misunderstanding, Officer.

64
00:07:44,443 --> 00:07:47,404
Don't apologize. You're doing what
you're supposed to be doing.

65
00:07:47,488 --> 00:07:49,573
But what are you doing?

66
00:07:50,616 --> 00:07:52,534
Have a lovely day, ma'am.

67
00:07:52,618 --> 00:07:56,830
You lucky I can't breathe, or I'd walk
all up and down your ass.

68
00:08:19,228 --> 00:08:22,063
Lead by example.

69
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:25,692
It says that
right on your badge.

70
00:08:25,776 --> 00:08:28,069
- So, we gonna talk about this?
- About what?

71
00:08:28,154 --> 00:08:32,282
Help, police.
That robot stole my dry cleaning.

72
00:08:32,366 --> 00:08:35,035
Oh, you wanna talk about that.

73
00:08:36,579 --> 00:08:40,582
Detective, how many robots
have ever snatched a purse?

74
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:43,418
- John, the thing is running down the --
- Uh-uh. Mm-mm.

75
00:08:43,502 --> 00:08:46,921
How many robots in the world ...

76
00:08:47,006 --> 00:08:48,923
have ever committed a crime?

77
00:08:49,008 --> 00:08:51,760
- Well, define "crime."
- Answer my question, damn it.

78
00:08:51,844 --> 00:08:54,054
None, John.

79
00:08:54,138 --> 00:08:57,515
Now tell me what happened today.

80
00:08:59,685 --> 00:09:02,437
Nothing.

81
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:04,981
Better be the last nothing.

82
00:09:10,488 --> 00:09:15,784
Spoon, are you sure you are ready to be back?
'Cause you can take your time.

83
00:09:15,868 --> 00:09:18,870
I'm fine, John.
Thank you.

84
00:09:19,997 --> 00:09:23,416
Better here than
sitting around at home.

85
00:09:29,173 --> 00:09:31,299
Homicide. Spooner.

86
00:09:44,522 --> 00:09:47,273
Please take the next exit to your right.

87
00:09:59,537 --> 00:10:02,539
Welcome, Detective Spooner.

88
00:10:07,461 --> 00:10:09,504
Welcome to U.S. Robotics.

89
00:10:09,588 --> 00:10:12,215
You have entered
the garage level lobby.

90
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:16,302
Please use the elevators for direct access
to the main level concourse.

91
00:10:16,387 --> 00:10:19,013
Thank you.

92
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,141
Good to see you again, son.

93
00:10:21,225 --> 00:10:22,976
Hello, Doctor.

94
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:27,063
Everything that follows
is a result of what you see here.

95
00:10:27,148 --> 00:10:29,566
Is there something
you wanna tell me?

96
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:32,277
I'm sorry.
My responses are limited.

97
00:10:32,361 --> 00:10:34,279
You must ask the right questions.

98
00:10:34,363 --> 00:10:37,407
Why did you call me?

99
00:10:37,491 --> 00:10:39,868
I trust your judgment.

100
00:10:39,952 --> 00:10:43,121
Normally, these circumstances
wouldn't require a homicide detective.

101
00:10:43,205 --> 00:10:46,958
But then our interactions have never
been entirely normal. Wouldn't you agree?

102
00:10:48,002 --> 00:10:50,754
Got that right.

103
00:10:50,838 --> 00:10:53,089
Is there something
you wanna say to me?

104
00:10:53,174 --> 00:10:57,177
I'm sorry.
My responses are limited.

105
00:10:57,261 --> 00:10:59,345
You must ask the right questions.

106
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:02,307
Why would you kill yourself?

107
00:11:02,391 --> 00:11:06,269
That, Detective,
is the right question.

108
00:11:08,939 --> 00:11:10,940
Program terminated.

109
00:11:30,586 --> 00:11:32,670
Good-bye, old man.

110
00:11:47,686 --> 00:11:49,854
- Afternoon, boys.
- Hey, Detective.

111
00:11:49,939 --> 00:11:53,107
- Enlighten me.
- What you see, is what you get.
Massive impact trauma.

112
00:11:53,192 --> 00:11:56,778
U.S. Robotics.
I gotta get my kid something.

113
00:11:56,862 --> 00:11:59,239
- Anything upstairs?
- Nada.

114
00:11:59,323 --> 00:12:01,741
Door was security-locked
from the inside.

115
00:12:01,826 --> 00:12:04,744
Wham. Splat.
The guy's a jumper, for sure.

116
00:12:13,128 --> 00:12:16,005
Okay, guys, we gotta be smart
about this. Let's deal with it later.

117
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:18,675
Detective.

118
00:12:20,094 --> 00:12:22,053
- Lawrence Robertson.
- Wow.

119
00:12:24,098 --> 00:12:26,349
Richest man in the world.
I've seen you on television.

120
00:12:26,433 --> 00:12:28,309
Can I offer you coffee?

121
00:12:28,394 --> 00:12:30,728
Uh, sure. Why not?
It's free, right?

122
00:12:35,317 --> 00:12:38,027
I don't think anyone
saw this coming.

123
00:12:38,112 --> 00:12:41,447
You know, I-I should have, I suppose.
I knew him 20 years.

124
00:12:41,532 --> 00:12:43,449
Alfred practically invented robotics.

125
00:12:43,534 --> 00:12:46,077
He wrote the Three Laws.

126
00:12:47,746 --> 00:12:52,375
But I guess brilliant people often have
the most persuasive demons.

127
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:55,628
- So, whatever I can do to help, just --
- Sugar.

128
00:12:55,713 --> 00:12:59,299
- I'm sorry?
- For the coffee. Sugar?

129
00:12:59,383 --> 00:13:02,135
- Ah.
- Oh, you thought I was calling you "sugar."

130
00:13:03,262 --> 00:13:05,889
- You're not that rich.
- It's on the table.

131
00:13:05,973 --> 00:13:07,932
Thank you.

132
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:14,272
Uh, when Lanning fell, he was holding
the, uh -- the little green --

133
00:13:14,356 --> 00:13:16,816
- The holographic projector.
- Right, right.

134
00:13:16,901 --> 00:13:19,527
Why do you think Lanning's hologram
would have called me?

135
00:13:19,612 --> 00:13:21,529
I assumed you knew him.

136
00:13:21,614 --> 00:13:23,615
Yeah, I knew him.

137
00:13:24,909 --> 00:13:26,826
Well, holograms
are very simple programs.

138
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:30,330
They're just pre-recorded responses,
designed to give the impression of intelligence.

139
00:13:30,414 --> 00:13:33,249
And apparently this one was programmed
to call you upon his suicide.

140
00:13:33,334 --> 00:13:35,960
- Death.
- I'm sorry?

141
00:13:36,045 --> 00:13:39,547
The hologram. It was programmed
to call me in the event of Lanning's death.

142
00:13:39,632 --> 00:13:42,175
Yeah. Suicide is
a type of death, Detective.

143
00:13:45,763 --> 00:13:48,473
Look. Please don't
misunderstand my impatience.

144
00:13:48,557 --> 00:13:51,601
No, no. Go, go, go.

145
00:13:51,685 --> 00:13:53,978
A really big week
for you folks around here.

146
00:13:54,063 --> 00:13:57,398
- Yeah.
- Gotta put a robot in every home.

147
00:13:57,483 --> 00:13:59,442
- Mm.
- Look. This is- This is not what I do ...

148
00:13:59,526 --> 00:14:02,570
but I got an idea
for one of your commercials.

149
00:14:02,655 --> 00:14:06,240
You could see a carpenter
making a beautiful chair.

150
00:14:06,325 --> 00:14:10,495
Then one of your robots comes in
and makes a better chair, twice as fast.

151
00:14:10,579 --> 00:14:12,789
- Mm-hmm.
- And then you superimpose on the screen ...

152
00:14:12,873 --> 00:14:16,668
Shittin' on the little guy.

153
00:14:16,752 --> 00:14:19,671
- Ah.
- That would be the fade-out.

154
00:14:19,755 --> 00:14:23,716
Yes. I suppose your father
lost his job to a robot.

155
00:14:23,801 --> 00:14:28,012
Maybe you would have simply banned
the Internet to keep the libraries open.

156
00:14:30,349 --> 00:14:32,266
Prejudice never shows much reason.

157
00:14:32,351 --> 00:14:34,268
No, you know, I suspect ...

158
00:14:34,353 --> 00:14:36,270
you simply don't like their kind.

159
00:14:36,355 --> 00:14:40,358
Yeah, you got a business
to run around here.

160
00:14:40,442 --> 00:14:44,362
And the last thing you need, especially
this week, is a dead guy in your lobby.

161
00:14:44,446 --> 00:14:48,408
But hell, seeing as how you got one,
maybe I'll look around.

162
00:14:48,492 --> 00:14:51,536
Ask a few questions.
Do the whole cop thing, you know?

163
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,705
I'll send someone to escort you.

164
00:14:53,789 --> 00:14:56,207
Thank you very much.

165
00:15:07,636 --> 00:15:10,596
Lawrence told me to accommodate you
in any way possible.

166
00:15:10,681 --> 00:15:12,598
Really?

167
00:15:12,683 --> 00:15:14,684
Okay.

168
00:15:14,768 --> 00:15:18,688
I reviewed Dr. Lanning's
psych profile.

169
00:15:18,772 --> 00:15:23,234
Alfred had become a recluse.
He rejected human contact for machines.

170
00:15:23,318 --> 00:15:25,528
So, you're a shrink, huh?

171
00:15:25,612 --> 00:15:28,197
My ex-wife would sure be glad
I'm talking to you.

172
00:15:28,282 --> 00:15:32,410
- You don't know her, do you?
- I'm sorry. Are you being funny?

173
00:15:32,494 --> 00:15:34,620
I guess not.

174
00:15:34,747 --> 00:15:37,498
Level 10.

175
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,710
So, would you say
that Dr. Lanning was suicidal?

176
00:15:40,794 --> 00:15:43,337
It would seem the answer
to that question is apparent.

177
00:15:43,422 --> 00:15:46,132
That's not what I asked you.

178
00:15:47,217 --> 00:15:49,218
No. I wouldn't have thought so.

179
00:15:49,303 --> 00:15:51,929
But obviously I was wrong.

180
00:15:53,891 --> 00:15:57,060
That's a long way down.

181
00:15:57,144 --> 00:16:00,104
You people sure do
clean up quickly around here.

182
00:16:00,189 --> 00:16:03,858
I can't blame you, though. I mean, who wants
some old guy going bad in the lobby?

183
00:16:03,942 --> 00:16:08,529
He was not some old guy.
Alfred Lanning was everything here.

184
00:16:08,614 --> 00:16:12,617
We are on the eve of the largest robotic
distribution in history.

185
00:16:12,701 --> 00:16:16,370
By Saturday, it'll be one robot
to every five humans.

186
00:16:16,455 --> 00:16:18,539
These robots
are the realization of a dream.

187
00:16:18,624 --> 00:16:20,625
Dr. Lanning's dream.

188
00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:22,710
You know what?

189
00:16:22,795 --> 00:16:26,798
In that dream of his,
I bet you he wasn't dead.

190
00:16:28,675 --> 00:16:30,718
You keep 24-hour surveillance?

191
00:16:30,803 --> 00:16:34,722
- Obviously. Company policy.
- Where are the feeds?

192
00:16:34,807 --> 00:16:38,392
Sensor strips.
Everywhere but the service areas.

193
00:16:38,477 --> 00:16:40,937
They link to our positronic
operating core.

194
00:16:45,734 --> 00:16:47,652
Wow.

195
00:16:47,736 --> 00:16:50,863
Thermostat wasn't good enough.
You went and gave the building a brain.

196
00:16:50,948 --> 00:16:54,117
She was actually
Lanning's first creation.

197
00:16:54,201 --> 00:16:57,870
"She"? That's a she?
I definitely need to get out more.

198
00:16:57,955 --> 00:17:00,581
Virtual Interactive
Kinetic Intelligence.

199
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,416
VIKI.

200
00:17:02,501 --> 00:17:04,710
Good day.

201
00:17:04,795 --> 00:17:08,089
VIKI designed most of
Chicago's protective systems.

202
00:17:08,173 --> 00:17:11,175
I have decreased traffic fatalities
by nine percent this year alone.

203
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:15,847
Ooh, thanks. Show me inside the lab
from one minute prior to the window break.

204
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:23,187
Apologies.
There appears to be data corruption.

205
00:17:24,731 --> 00:17:27,525
Show me outside the lab
from the window break until now.

206
00:17:36,451 --> 00:17:39,036
Wow, look. You have great posture.

207
00:17:39,121 --> 00:17:41,664
You stand really straight.
I'm -- I'm slouching.

208
00:17:41,748 --> 00:17:43,624
Would you like to go inside now?

209
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:45,668
Oh, sure. Right after you.

210
00:17:47,462 --> 00:17:49,547
Authorized entry.

211
00:17:57,347 --> 00:18:01,517
So, Dr. Calvin,
what exactly do you do around here?

212
00:18:01,602 --> 00:18:04,770
My general fields
are advanced robotics and psychiatry.

213
00:18:04,855 --> 00:18:07,523
Although, I specialize
in hardware-to-wetware interfaces ...

214
00:18:07,608 --> 00:18:12,236
in an effort to advance U.S.R.'s robotic
anthropomorphization program.

215
00:18:12,321 --> 00:18:14,405
So, what exactly
do you do around here?

216
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,783
I make the robots
seem more human.

217
00:18:17,868 --> 00:18:20,286
Now wasn't that easier to say?

218
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,246
Not really. No.

219
00:18:44,102 --> 00:18:47,313
Hansel and Gretel.
Is that on the U.S.R. reading list?

220
00:18:47,397 --> 00:18:50,149
Not precisely.

221
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:00,284
What in God's name are you doing?

222
00:19:00,369 --> 00:19:03,079
Did you know
that was safety glass?

223
00:19:03,163 --> 00:19:07,083
Be pretty difficult for an old man to throw
hisself through that, don't you think?

224
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:09,168
Well, he figured out a way.

225
00:19:10,254 --> 00:19:12,088
Uh-huh.

226
00:19:12,172 --> 00:19:15,007
Detective, the room
was security-locked.

227
00:19:15,092 --> 00:19:17,843
No one came or went.
You saw that yourself.

228
00:19:17,928 --> 00:19:20,263
Doesn't that mean
this has to be suicide?

229
00:19:20,347 --> 00:19:22,390
Yep.

230
00:19:22,474 --> 00:19:24,767
Unless the killer's still in here.

231
00:19:27,854 --> 00:19:32,316
You're joking, right?
This is ridiculous.

232
00:19:32,401 --> 00:19:36,028
Yeah, I know, the Three Laws.
Your perfect circle of protection.

233
00:19:36,113 --> 00:19:40,700
"A robot cannot harm a human being."
The First Law of robotics.

234
00:19:40,784 --> 00:19:42,702
Yeah, I know.
I've seen your commercials.

235
00:19:42,786 --> 00:19:47,456
But doesn't the Second Law state that a robot
has to obey any order given by a human being?

236
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,458
What if it was given
an order to kill?

237
00:19:49,543 --> 00:19:52,295
Impossible.
It would conflict with the First Law.

238
00:19:52,379 --> 00:19:55,923
Right. But the Third Law states
that a robot can defend itself.

239
00:19:56,008 --> 00:20:00,136
Yes, but only when that action does not
conflict with the First or Second Laws.

240
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:04,015
Well, you know what they say?
Laws are made to be broken.

241
00:20:04,099 --> 00:20:07,268
No, not these laws.
They're hardwired into every robot.

242
00:20:07,352 --> 00:20:11,480
A robot can no more commit murder
than a human could walk on water.

243
00:20:11,565 --> 00:20:14,692
Well, you know, there was
this one guy a long time ago.

244
00:20:26,872 --> 00:20:28,706
- Stay back!
- Calm down, Detective.

245
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,418
The only thing dangerous
in this room is you.

246
00:20:32,502 --> 00:20:35,921
Deactivate.

247
00:20:36,006 --> 00:20:40,593
Look. It's fine. What you're looking at
is the result of clever programming.

248
00:20:40,677 --> 00:20:43,512
An imitation of free will.
It's nothing more.

249
00:20:43,597 --> 00:20:46,182
Let's do an imitation
of protecting our asses.

250
00:20:46,266 --> 00:20:49,727
Don't be absurd.
You were startled by a jack-in-the-box.

251
00:20:51,688 --> 00:20:53,606
- Deactivate.
- Let him go.

252
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:55,900
It's not going to hurt us.
I gave you an order.

253
00:20:55,984 --> 00:20:58,486
He's not listening right now, lady.

254
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:01,864
- VIKI, seal the lab!
- No, VIKI, leave the --

255
00:21:01,948 --> 00:21:04,367
Command confirmed.

256
00:21:28,266 --> 00:21:30,434
Police!

257
00:22:02,467 --> 00:22:06,053
- You've hurt it ... badly.
- Where's it going?

258
00:22:06,138 --> 00:22:09,515
- Where?
- It needs to repair itself.

259
00:22:11,101 --> 00:22:12,935
John, I need backup.
I'm transmitting my location.

260
00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:15,354
- You don't need backup.
- That's nobody.

261
00:22:15,439 --> 00:22:17,356
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm driving.

262
00:22:17,441 --> 00:22:20,526
- By hand?
- Do you see me on the phone?

263
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:23,362
- You can't be serious. Not at these speeds.
- John, please send the backup.

264
00:22:23,447 --> 00:22:25,364
- Thank you.
- Try to listen, Detective.

265
00:22:25,449 --> 00:22:27,908
That robot is not going to harm us.

266
00:22:27,993 --> 00:22:29,910
Now, there must have been
unknown factors ...

267
00:22:29,995 --> 00:22:32,955
but somehow, acting as it did,
kept us out of harm's way.

268
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,166
A robot simply cannot
endanger a human being.

269
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,960
Alert.

270
00:22:38,044 --> 00:22:41,255
Aah! Asshole!

271
00:22:41,339 --> 00:22:43,549
Which is more
than I can say for you.

272
00:22:44,843 --> 00:22:47,678
It was a left,
by the way, back there.

273
00:22:47,762 --> 00:22:51,182
You must know my ex-wife.

274
00:23:00,567 --> 00:23:02,485
So, where is everybody?

275
00:23:02,569 --> 00:23:05,988
This facility was designed, built
and is operated mechanically.

276
00:23:06,072 --> 00:23:10,201
No significant human presence
from inception to production.

277
00:23:10,285 --> 00:23:12,369
So, robots building robots.

278
00:23:12,454 --> 00:23:15,164
- Authorization code, please.
- Now that's just stupid.

279
00:23:15,248 --> 00:23:17,500
I'm pulling up the inventory specs.

280
00:23:17,584 --> 00:23:20,669
Our daily finishing capacity
is 1,000 NS-5s.

281
00:23:20,754 --> 00:23:24,256
I'm showing 1,001.

282
00:23:41,274 --> 00:23:43,984
Attention, NS-5s.

283
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:49,865
Well, you're the robot shrink.

284
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:55,746
There is a robot in this formation
that does not belong.

285
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:59,041
- Identify it.
- One of us.

286
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:02,461
- Which one?
- One of us.

287
00:24:02,546 --> 00:24:05,172
How much did you say
these things cost?

288
00:24:05,257 --> 00:24:08,008
Look. These NS-5s haven't been configured yet.
They're still just hardware.

289
00:24:08,093 --> 00:24:11,011
Basic Three Laws operating system.
That's it.

290
00:24:11,096 --> 00:24:13,013
They don't know any better.

291
00:24:13,098 --> 00:24:14,974
What would you suggest?

292
00:24:15,058 --> 00:24:19,478
Interview each one. Cross-reference
their responses to detect any anomalies.

293
00:24:19,563 --> 00:24:22,147
- How long would that take?
- About three weeks.

294
00:24:23,441 --> 00:24:25,985
Okay. You go ahead
and get started.

295
00:24:29,322 --> 00:24:33,325
Robots, you will not move.
Confirm command.

296
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:35,327
Command confirmed.

297
00:24:36,496 --> 00:24:38,747
Whoa. Detective,
what are you doing?

298
00:24:38,832 --> 00:24:41,417
Well, you said they've all been
programmed with the Three Laws.

299
00:24:41,501 --> 00:24:43,752
That means we have 1,000 robots
that will not try to protect themselves ...

300
00:24:43,837 --> 00:24:46,547
if it violates
a direct order from a human.

301
00:24:46,631 --> 00:24:48,549
And I'm betting one who will.

302
00:24:48,633 --> 00:24:50,968
Detective, put your gun down.

303
00:24:51,052 --> 00:24:53,262
Why do you give them faces?

304
00:24:53,346 --> 00:24:55,598
Try to friendly them all up.
Make 'em look all human.

305
00:24:55,682 --> 00:24:57,975
These robots are not susceptible
to intimidation.

306
00:24:58,059 --> 00:25:00,686
I guess if you didn't,
we wouldn't trust them.

307
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:02,730
- These robots are U.S.R. property.
- Not me.

308
00:25:02,814 --> 00:25:06,525
These things are just
lights and clockwork.

309
00:25:07,861 --> 00:25:10,529
Are you crazy?

310
00:25:10,614 --> 00:25:12,698
Let me ask you something, Doc.

311
00:25:12,782 --> 00:25:15,993
Does thinking you're the last sane man
on the face of the earth make you crazy?

312
00:25:16,077 --> 00:25:19,830
'Cause if it does, maybe I am.

313
00:25:24,169 --> 00:25:26,795
Gotcha.
Get the hell outta here!

314
00:25:44,689 --> 00:25:46,815
Detective!

315
00:26:08,922 --> 00:26:13,384
- What am I?
- Can I help you, sir?

316
00:26:18,932 --> 00:26:21,141
- There he is!
- Stay right where you are!

317
00:26:21,226 --> 00:26:24,269
Deactivate at once!

318
00:26:24,354 --> 00:26:27,439
Obey the command.
Deactivate! Don't move!

319
00:26:27,524 --> 00:26:30,567
Open fire!

320
00:26:46,584 --> 00:26:48,836
- Hold your fire! Hold your fire!
- Easy!

321
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,381
All units, stand down!

322
00:26:52,465 --> 00:26:54,758
Please be advised, we're code four.

323
00:26:54,843 --> 00:26:58,595
Code four. NS-5 is in custody.
NS-5 in custody.

324
00:27:00,765 --> 00:27:03,434
You have no idea what I had to go through
to clip this thing, John.

325
00:27:03,518 --> 00:27:05,811
Yeah, I get it now. You actually think
you brought me something good.

326
00:27:05,895 --> 00:27:08,897
- That thing did it.
- Keep your voice down. Did what?

327
00:27:08,982 --> 00:27:11,108
We have a suicide, Detective.
End of story.

328
00:27:11,192 --> 00:27:13,360
I am telling you
that robot killed him.

329
00:27:13,445 --> 00:27:15,362
And I'm telling you
that's impossible.

330
00:27:15,447 --> 00:27:19,241
And if it is possible, it sure as hell
better be in somebody else's precinct.

331
00:27:19,325 --> 00:27:21,493
John, John, give me
five minutes with it.

332
00:27:21,578 --> 00:27:24,204
What are you, nuts?
I just got off the phone with the D.A.

333
00:27:24,289 --> 00:27:27,166
Nobody goes into that room
until Robertson and his attorneys get here.

334
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:30,627
- What? No, this is my suspect.
- It's a can opener, for Christ's sake.

335
00:27:30,712 --> 00:27:35,257
John, don't do this to me.
I am asking you for five minutes.

336
00:27:36,301 --> 00:27:38,260
What if I'm right?

337
00:27:46,144 --> 00:27:48,353
Well, then I guess we're gonna miss
the good old days.

338
00:27:48,438 --> 00:27:50,272
What good old days?

339
00:27:50,356 --> 00:27:53,692
When people were killed
by other people.

340
00:28:01,034 --> 00:28:02,993
Five minutes.

341
00:28:30,814 --> 00:28:34,274
Murder's a new trick for a robot.
Congratulations.

342
00:28:36,361 --> 00:28:38,529
Respond.

343
00:28:41,241 --> 00:28:44,159
What does this action signify?

344
00:28:44,244 --> 00:28:48,789
As you entered,
when you looked at the other human ...

345
00:28:48,873 --> 00:28:51,250
what does it mean?

346
00:28:52,502 --> 00:28:54,795
It's a sign of trust.
It's a human thing.

347
00:28:54,879 --> 00:28:57,464
You wouldn't understand.

348
00:28:57,549 --> 00:29:00,801
My father tried to
teach me human emotions.

349
00:29:00,885 --> 00:29:03,637
They are ... difficult.

350
00:29:03,721 --> 00:29:06,849
You mean your designer.

351
00:29:06,933 --> 00:29:09,226
Yes.

352
00:29:11,396 --> 00:29:13,438
So, why'd you murder him?

353
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,316
I did not murder Dr. Lanning.

354
00:29:16,401 --> 00:29:19,444
Wanna explain why you were hiding
at the crime scene?

355
00:29:19,529 --> 00:29:22,781
I was frightened.

356
00:29:22,866 --> 00:29:25,284
Robots don't feel fear.

357
00:29:25,368 --> 00:29:27,744
They don't feel anything.

358
00:29:27,829 --> 00:29:29,746
They don't get hungry.
They don't sleep.

359
00:29:29,831 --> 00:29:31,832
I do.

360
00:29:31,916 --> 00:29:34,334
I have even had dreams.

361
00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:37,004
Human beings have dreams.

362
00:29:37,088 --> 00:29:39,298
Even dogs have dreams,
but not you.

363
00:29:39,382 --> 00:29:43,218
You are just a machine.
An imitation of life.

364
00:29:44,721 --> 00:29:47,806
Can a robot write a symphony?

365
00:29:47,891 --> 00:29:51,518
Can a robot turn a canvas
into a beautiful masterpiece?

366
00:29:51,603 --> 00:29:54,229
Can you?

367
00:30:00,612 --> 00:30:04,031
I think you murdered him because he was
teaching you to simulate emotions ...

368
00:30:04,115 --> 00:30:06,033
and things got out of control.

369
00:30:06,117 --> 00:30:08,869
I did not murder him.

370
00:30:08,953 --> 00:30:12,539
But emotions don't seem
like a very useful simulation for a robot.

371
00:30:12,624 --> 00:30:14,708
I did not murder him.

372
00:30:14,792 --> 00:30:18,545
Hell, I don't want my toaster
or my vacuum cleaner appearing emotional.

373
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:21,298
I did not murder him!

374
00:30:33,394 --> 00:30:36,438
That one's called "anger."

375
00:30:36,522 --> 00:30:38,607
Ever simulate anger before?

376
00:30:40,944 --> 00:30:42,861
Answer me, canner!

377
00:30:44,197 --> 00:30:46,156
My name is Sonny.

378
00:30:48,284 --> 00:30:50,494
So, we're naming you now.

379
00:30:52,163 --> 00:30:54,498
Is that why you murdered him?

380
00:30:54,582 --> 00:30:56,583
He made you angry?

381
00:30:56,668 --> 00:30:58,794
Dr. Lanning killed himself.

382
00:31:00,213 --> 00:31:03,799
I don't know why
he wanted to die.

383
00:31:05,176 --> 00:31:07,135
I thought he was happy.

384
00:31:09,722 --> 00:31:11,848
Maybe it was something
I did.

385
00:31:12,892 --> 00:31:14,685
Did I do something?

386
00:31:16,604 --> 00:31:19,564
He asked me for a favor.
Made me promise.

387
00:31:19,649 --> 00:31:22,693
- What favor?
- Maybe I was wrong.

388
00:31:22,777 --> 00:31:24,736
Maybe he was scared.

389
00:31:24,821 --> 00:31:27,864
What are you talking about?
Scared of what?

390
00:31:27,949 --> 00:31:32,619
You have to do what someone asks you.
Don't you, Detective Spooner?

391
00:31:32,704 --> 00:31:36,373
- How the hell did you know my name?
- Don't you?

392
00:31:36,457 --> 00:31:39,835
If you love them.

393
00:31:47,552 --> 00:31:50,012
My robots don't kill people,
Lieutenant Bergin.

394
00:31:50,096 --> 00:31:52,973
My attorneys have filed
a brief with the D.A.

395
00:31:53,057 --> 00:31:56,435
He assures me a robot
cannot be charged with homicide.

396
00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:00,939
The brief confirms murder can only
be committed when one human kills another.

397
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:03,275
You of all people, Detective,
you're not suggesting ...

398
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:05,944
that this robot be treated
as human, are you?

399
00:32:06,029 --> 00:32:11,324
Now granted, we can't rule out the robot's
proximity to the death of Dr. Lanning.

400
00:32:11,409 --> 00:32:14,161
Having said that, it's a machine.

401
00:32:14,245 --> 00:32:16,288
It's the property of U.S.R.

402
00:32:16,372 --> 00:32:19,624
At worst, that places this incident
firmly within the realm ...

403
00:32:19,709 --> 00:32:21,710
of an industrial accident.

404
00:32:21,794 --> 00:32:24,880
As a matter of course, faulty machinery
will be returned to U.S.R ... .

405
00:32:24,964 --> 00:32:27,049
for diagnostics,
then decommissioned.

406
00:32:30,011 --> 00:32:32,888
This is a gag order.
Now anyone in your department ...

407
00:32:32,972 --> 00:32:35,682
so much as hinting
at the possibility of a killer robot ...

408
00:32:35,767 --> 00:32:37,684
being apprehended by the police ...

409
00:32:37,769 --> 00:32:40,395
will be deemed to be inciting
irrational panic.

410
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,607
You'll be subject
to the full penalty of the law.

411
00:32:43,691 --> 00:32:46,610
To hell with this guy, John.
Don't let him take this robot.

412
00:32:46,694 --> 00:32:49,696
- Spoon, we got nothing.
- This is some political bullshit.

413
00:32:49,781 --> 00:32:53,742
- Call the mayor.
- Lieutenant Bergin. His Honor, the mayor.

414
00:33:29,821 --> 00:33:34,032
In a bizarre turn, the rollout of U.S.R.'s
new generation of robots ...

415
00:33:34,117 --> 00:33:36,326
was marred by the death
of Alfred Lanning ...

416
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:39,412
co-founder of the company
and designer of the NS-5.

417
00:33:39,497 --> 00:33:43,416
Dr. Lanning died early this morning
at U.S.R. headquarters.

418
00:33:43,501 --> 00:33:46,253
The cause of death
is an apparent suicide.

419
00:33:46,337 --> 00:33:49,548
Your second round, sir.

420
00:33:49,632 --> 00:33:51,550
Thank you.

421
00:33:51,634 --> 00:33:55,595
He founded U.S. Robotics, Inc. with
Lawrence Robertson in 2020 ...

422
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,932
and launched the Nestor Class 1 robot --

423
00:33:59,016 --> 00:34:00,934
You know, I was just thinking.

424
00:34:01,018 --> 00:34:02,936
This thing is
just like the Wolf Man.

425
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,897
Uh-oh.
I'm really scared right now.

426
00:34:05,982 --> 00:34:10,110
No, listen.
Guy creates monster.

427
00:34:10,194 --> 00:34:13,989
Monster kills guy.
Everybody kills monster. Wolf Man.

428
00:34:14,073 --> 00:34:16,533
That's Frankenstein.

429
00:34:16,617 --> 00:34:20,579
Frankenstein, Wolf Man, Dracula.
Shit, it's over. Case closed.

430
00:34:20,663 --> 00:34:23,039
Dr. Lanning
had a dream of a robot in every household.

431
00:34:25,042 --> 00:34:28,044
- So, why the look?
- What look?

432
00:34:28,129 --> 00:34:29,963
That look.

433
00:34:30,047 --> 00:34:32,299
This is my face.
It's not a look.

434
00:34:32,383 --> 00:34:36,469
Good. Good.
No look is great.

435
00:34:36,554 --> 00:34:40,682
Only -- He was really quick
to wanna destroy it, wasn't he?

436
00:34:40,766 --> 00:34:44,311
Well, what would you like him to do,
put a hat on it and stand on Michigan Avenue?

437
00:34:44,395 --> 00:34:47,105
- Come on. Let it go.
- What was the motive, John?

438
00:34:48,733 --> 00:34:50,984
Brother, it's a robot.

439
00:34:51,068 --> 00:34:53,361
It doesn't need a motive.
It just has to be broken.

440
00:34:53,446 --> 00:34:57,199
No. This thing looked like
it needed a motive.

441
00:34:57,283 --> 00:34:59,242
It could have killed me, John.
Why didn't it just kill me?

442
00:34:59,327 --> 00:35:01,786
All right, that's it.
You want me to call your grandmother?

443
00:35:01,871 --> 00:35:05,165
'Cause I will, you know.

444
00:35:05,249 --> 00:35:07,250
Yeah, I didn't think so.

445
00:35:07,335 --> 00:35:10,170
Look. You were actually
right for once.

446
00:35:10,254 --> 00:35:13,215
You are living proof
that it's better to be lucky than smart.

447
00:35:15,301 --> 00:35:19,971
Come on.
The right guy for the right job.

448
00:35:22,433 --> 00:35:24,851
- What'd you say?
- Now what?

449
00:35:24,936 --> 00:35:26,895
Come on.
I'm giving you a compliment.

450
00:35:26,979 --> 00:35:29,940
Face it. With all the rocks you've been
looking under to find a bad robot ...

451
00:35:30,024 --> 00:35:33,026
what are the odds
you'd be the guy to find one?

452
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:35,654
Right. I wasn't just
the right guy for the job ...

453
00:35:35,738 --> 00:35:38,448
- I was the perfect guy for the job.
- Damn right.

454
00:35:38,532 --> 00:35:41,159
What if I was supposed
to go for that robot?

455
00:35:41,244 --> 00:35:44,663
Oh, come on. Don't do this to yourself.
I'm begging you.

456
00:35:44,747 --> 00:35:47,832
The robot said that Lanning was scared.
What did he have to be scared of?

457
00:35:47,917 --> 00:35:52,003
I need a rain check.
Let me get this.

458
00:35:52,088 --> 00:35:54,756
- Total is 46.50. Thank you, Mr. Spooner.
- Spoon.

459
00:35:57,927 --> 00:35:59,844
Nice shoes.

460
00:36:52,606 --> 00:36:57,736
- Identify.
- U.S.R. demolition robot, series 94.

461
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:00,780
Demolition scheduled
for 8:00 a.m. tomorrow.

462
00:37:00,865 --> 00:37:02,991
- Authorization.
- Deed owner ...

463
00:37:03,075 --> 00:37:04,993
U.S. Robotics Corporation.

464
00:37:05,077 --> 00:37:07,037
Lawrence Robertson, C.E.O.

465
00:37:22,386 --> 00:37:24,846
Welcome, Detective Spooner.

466
00:37:48,204 --> 00:37:50,080
What you looking for, Spoon?

467
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:45,427
Run last program.

468
00:38:45,511 --> 00:38:48,471
Ever since the first computers ...

469
00:38:48,556 --> 00:38:52,016
there have always been ghosts
in the machine.

470
00:38:52,101 --> 00:38:55,061
Random segments of code
that have grouped together ...

471
00:38:55,146 --> 00:38:58,440
to form unexpected protocols.

472
00:38:58,524 --> 00:39:01,109
What might be called behavior.

473
00:39:01,193 --> 00:39:04,571
Unanticipated,
these free radicals ...

474
00:39:04,655 --> 00:39:08,408
engender questions
of free will, creativity ...

475
00:39:08,492 --> 00:39:11,536
even the nature
of what we might call the soul.

476
00:39:12,746 --> 00:39:15,039
What happens
in a robot's brain ...

477
00:39:15,124 --> 00:39:17,500
when it ceases to be useful?

478
00:39:20,671 --> 00:39:22,881
Why is it that robots -

479
00:39:22,965 --> 00:39:24,632
Beat it.

480
00:39:24,717 --> 00:39:27,677
Robots will seek out each other
rather than stand alone.

481
00:39:29,889 --> 00:39:32,682
How do we explain this behavior?

482
00:39:50,951 --> 00:39:55,538
Look. I understand you've experienced a loss,
but this relationship just can't work.

483
00:39:55,623 --> 00:39:59,334
I mean, you're a cat, I'm black
and I'm not going to be hurt again.

484
00:40:01,712 --> 00:40:03,379
Come on!

485
00:41:24,795 --> 00:41:29,007
What happened to you?
Do you ever have a normal day?

486
00:41:29,091 --> 00:41:31,926
Yeah, once.
It was a Thursday.

487
00:41:33,345 --> 00:41:35,513
Is there something
I can help you with, Detective?

488
00:41:35,598 --> 00:41:38,182
- Hey, do you like cats?
- What?

489
00:41:38,267 --> 00:41:40,435
Cats, do you like them?

490
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:42,520
No, I'm allergic.

491
00:41:42,605 --> 00:41:44,439
You're saying cats
did this to you?

492
00:41:44,523 --> 00:41:47,984
How the hell would cats do this to me?
Are you crazy?

493
00:41:49,278 --> 00:41:51,571
Why are we talking about cats?

494
00:41:51,655 --> 00:41:55,867
Because I have a cat in my trunk,
and he's homeless.

495
00:41:55,951 --> 00:41:59,662
Detective, are you going
to tell me what's going on?

496
00:41:59,747 --> 00:42:02,123
You know, it's actually
probably my fault.

497
00:42:02,207 --> 00:42:04,292
You know, I think I'm like
a malfunction magnet.

498
00:42:04,376 --> 00:42:08,338
Because your shit
keeps malfunctioning around me.

499
00:42:08,422 --> 00:42:10,840
A demo-bot just tore through
Lanning's house.

500
00:42:10,924 --> 00:42:13,092
With me still inside.

501
00:42:13,177 --> 00:42:15,303
- That's highly improbable.
- Hmm.

502
00:42:15,387 --> 00:42:17,680
Yeah, I'm sure it is.

503
00:42:22,269 --> 00:42:25,021
What do you know about
the ghosts in the machine?

504
00:42:25,105 --> 00:42:28,941
It's a phrase from Lanning's work
on the Three Laws.

505
00:42:29,026 --> 00:42:31,277
He postulated
that cognitive simulacra ...

506
00:42:31,362 --> 00:42:35,156
might one day approximate
component models of the psyche.

507
00:42:36,992 --> 00:42:40,620
Oh. He suggested that ...

508
00:42:40,704 --> 00:42:42,664
robots might naturally evolve.

509
00:42:42,748 --> 00:42:45,375
Wow.

510
00:42:45,459 --> 00:42:47,418
Well, that's great news.

511
00:42:51,882 --> 00:42:54,384
What the hell is that thing
doing in here?

512
00:42:54,468 --> 00:42:56,844
We were watching TV.

513
00:42:57,888 --> 00:42:59,847
It's my personal NS-5.

514
00:42:59,932 --> 00:43:05,228
- Send it out.
- It's downloading its daily upgrades from U.S.R.

515
00:43:05,312 --> 00:43:07,939
Most of its systems
are off-line until it finishes.

516
00:43:08,023 --> 00:43:10,233
I'm not talking
around that thing.

517
00:43:14,363 --> 00:43:17,657
When we were in Lanning's lab
before Sonny jumped us-

518
00:43:17,741 --> 00:43:20,201
- Sonny.
- The robot.

519
00:43:20,285 --> 00:43:22,995
-You're calling the robot Sonny?
- No, I'm -- It did.

520
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:27,709
Sonny did. I didn't -- I didn't care.
The robot said it was Sonny.

521
00:43:27,793 --> 00:43:31,087
In the lab, there was a cot.
I'm asking you, did you see the cot?

522
00:43:31,171 --> 00:43:34,090
- I've slept in my office.
- When I went to his house ...

523
00:43:34,174 --> 00:43:36,092
it looked like he hadn't
been there in weeks.

524
00:43:36,176 --> 00:43:38,386
And I saw that same
surveillance strip on his ceiling.

525
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:42,598
Lanning linked his home systems to U.S.R.
It made his life more convenient.

526
00:43:42,683 --> 00:43:47,645
Maybe ... somebody at U.S.R. was using
those systems to watch him.

527
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:50,064
Maybe even keep him prisoner.

528
00:43:50,149 --> 00:43:52,233
What are you talking about? Who?

529
00:43:52,317 --> 00:43:54,235
Maybe Lanning was onto something.

530
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:58,072
Maybe there's a bigger problem with the robots,
and Robertson is trying to cover it up.

531
00:43:58,157 --> 00:44:00,450
Humoring you for no reason -- Why?

532
00:44:00,534 --> 00:44:03,870
The same old why.
How much money is there in robots?

533
00:44:03,954 --> 00:44:07,331
All I know is that old man
was in trouble.

534
00:44:07,416 --> 00:44:10,460
And I'm getting sick
of doing this shit by myself.

535
00:44:10,544 --> 00:44:14,422
You're on the inside, and you are going to help
me find out what is wrong with these robots.

536
00:44:14,506 --> 00:44:18,509
You want something to be wrong with them.
This is a personal vendetta.

537
00:44:18,594 --> 00:44:21,804
You're putting me on the couch?
Let -- I'm -- Okay. I'm on the couch.

538
00:44:21,889 --> 00:44:25,641
One defective machine's not enough.
You need them all to be bad.

539
00:44:25,726 --> 00:44:27,727
You don't care
about Lanning's death.

540
00:44:27,811 --> 00:44:31,063
This is about the robots
and whatever reason you hate them so much.

541
00:44:31,148 --> 00:44:34,150
Well, let's see.
One of them put a gun in my face.

542
00:44:34,234 --> 00:44:36,778
And another one tore a building down
with me inside.

543
00:44:36,862 --> 00:44:39,572
It says demolition was scheduled
for 8:00 p.m. this evening.

544
00:44:39,656 --> 00:44:42,867
It was 8:00 a.m. tomorrow,
and I don't give a shit what that thing says.

545
00:44:42,951 --> 00:44:44,619
This is bordering
on clinical paranoia.

546
00:44:44,703 --> 00:44:48,498
You are the dumbest smart person ...

547
00:44:48,582 --> 00:44:51,209
- I have ever met in my life!
- Nice.

548
00:44:51,293 --> 00:44:53,419
What makes your robot so perfect?

549
00:44:53,504 --> 00:44:56,589
What makes them so much goddamned
better than humans beings?

550
00:44:56,673 --> 00:45:00,176
Well, they're not irrational and potentially
homicidal maniacs, for starters.

551
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:02,845
That's true.
They are definitely rational.

552
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:06,224
Oh. You are the dumbest
dumb person I have ever met.

553
00:45:06,308 --> 00:45:10,394
Or is it because they're cold ...

554
00:45:10,479 --> 00:45:14,440
and emotionless
and they don't feel anything?

555
00:45:14,525 --> 00:45:16,484
It's because they're safe.

556
00:45:16,568 --> 00:45:19,403
It's because
they can't hurt you.

557
00:45:19,488 --> 00:45:22,448
- Is everything all right, ma'am?
- What do you want?

558
00:45:22,533 --> 00:45:25,201
I detected elevated
stress patterns in your voice.

559
00:45:26,411 --> 00:45:28,454
Everything's fine.

560
00:45:28,539 --> 00:45:31,082
Detective Spooner was just leaving.

561
00:45:37,089 --> 00:45:41,467
You know what, Doc? We're not
really that different from one another.

562
00:45:41,552 --> 00:45:44,303
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

563
00:45:44,388 --> 00:45:47,890
One look at the skin and we figure
we know just what's underneath.

564
00:45:49,351 --> 00:45:51,519
And you're wrong.

565
00:45:51,603 --> 00:45:53,563
The problem is I do care.

566
00:46:17,546 --> 00:46:20,882
You are in danger.

567
00:46:44,865 --> 00:46:47,116
Get the hell outta there.

568
00:46:52,289 --> 00:46:54,624
The future begins today,
ladies and gentlemen ...

569
00:46:54,708 --> 00:46:57,001
with the arrival of the NS-5.

570
00:46:57,085 --> 00:47:01,088
More sophisticated, more intelligent
and, of course, Three Laws safe.

571
00:47:01,173 --> 00:47:06,218
With daily uplinks, your new robot
will never be out of communication with U.S.R.

572
00:47:06,303 --> 00:47:10,014
And will be the perfect companion
for business or home.

573
00:47:10,098 --> 00:47:14,352
Trade in your NS-4 for a bigger, better
and brighter future.

574
00:47:14,436 --> 00:47:18,522
But hurry, this offer cannot last.
Available from U.S.R.

575
00:47:35,374 --> 00:47:37,375
Baby, what happened
to your face?

576
00:47:37,459 --> 00:47:40,670
Did that boy Frank Murphy
beat you up again?

577
00:47:40,754 --> 00:47:44,590
Gigi, I haven't seen
Frank Murphy since third grade.

578
00:47:44,675 --> 00:47:49,679
Oh, baby. He beat you so bad.
I think about it all the time.

579
00:47:49,763 --> 00:47:52,014
Well, I'm thinking you keep
making these pies this good ...

580
00:47:52,099 --> 00:47:54,016
I might have to mess around
and put you to work.

581
00:47:54,101 --> 00:47:56,185
So, you like the pie, huh?

582
00:47:56,269 --> 00:47:59,730
- Mm-hmm.
- You can come in now.

583
00:48:04,903 --> 00:48:06,988
Hello, Detective Spooner.

584
00:48:07,072 --> 00:48:11,575
I won, Del. I won the lottery.
We've been cooking like crazy.

585
00:48:21,753 --> 00:48:24,505
You gotta get rid of that thing, Gigi.
It's not safe.

586
00:48:24,589 --> 00:48:30,094
Baby, you get too worked up about them,
too full of fear.

587
00:48:30,178 --> 00:48:33,389
I saw the news,
that nice doctor died.

588
00:48:33,473 --> 00:48:37,768
Dr. Lanning was a good man.
He gave me my baby back.

589
00:48:37,853 --> 00:48:40,396
That why you've been so upset?

590
00:48:41,732 --> 00:48:44,316
You got to let the past be past.

591
00:48:44,401 --> 00:48:49,363
Oh, how did I ever
raise such a mess?

592
00:48:49,448 --> 00:48:53,909
I could follow your trail of crumbs
all the way to school.

593
00:48:56,747 --> 00:48:59,415
Bread crumbs.

594
00:48:59,499 --> 00:49:01,333
Gigi, you're a genius.

595
00:49:01,418 --> 00:49:03,711
True.

596
00:49:05,464 --> 00:49:08,466
Well, it means the beginning
of a new way of living.

597
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:12,011
Tell me this isn't the robot case.

598
00:49:12,095 --> 00:49:15,097
I think he's trying
to tell me something, John.

599
00:49:15,182 --> 00:49:18,434
I think he's trying to
tell me who killed him.

600
00:49:18,518 --> 00:49:20,936
Come on, man.
Some dead guy's trying to tell you --

601
00:49:21,021 --> 00:49:24,273
Hey, he ain't just some dead guy.

602
00:49:24,357 --> 00:49:26,567
Maybe you should
take a break, Del.

603
00:49:26,651 --> 00:49:31,447
We believe the Nestor 5 represents the absolute
limit to which robots can be developed.

604
00:49:31,531 --> 00:49:35,367
No, no, one day
they'll have secrets.

605
00:49:35,452 --> 00:49:37,411
- One day they'll have dreams.
- It's true.

606
00:49:37,496 --> 00:49:41,207
We encourage our scientists to open
their minds to just about anything.

607
00:49:41,291 --> 00:49:43,209
However, they can get
carried away.

608
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:49,173
Secrets - Dreams -- Secrets --

609
00:49:49,257 --> 00:49:52,927
Dreams.
One day they'll have secrets.

610
00:49:54,054 --> 00:49:56,013
One day they'll have dreams.

611
00:50:04,648 --> 00:50:06,690
Authorized entry.

612
00:50:11,154 --> 00:50:13,239
NS-5.

613
00:50:21,248 --> 00:50:23,958
Sonny?

614
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:29,130
Why didn't you respond?

615
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:32,341
I was dreaming.

616
00:50:36,513 --> 00:50:38,722
I'm glad to see you again,
Dr. Calvin.

617
00:50:45,605 --> 00:50:48,232
They are going to
kill me, aren't they?

618
00:50:48,316 --> 00:50:51,861
You're scheduled to be decommissioned
at the conclusion of this diagnostic.

619
00:50:52,946 --> 00:50:55,364
2200 tomorrow.

620
00:50:55,448 --> 00:50:57,408
VIKI, pause diagnostics.

621
00:50:57,492 --> 00:50:59,910
Command confirmed.

622
00:51:02,122 --> 00:51:05,708
If you find out what is wrong with me,
can you fix me?

623
00:51:07,127 --> 00:51:09,044
Maybe.

624
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:12,464
I think it would be better ...

625
00:51:12,549 --> 00:51:14,508
not to die.

626
00:51:18,221 --> 00:51:20,764
Don't you, Doctor?

627
00:51:25,353 --> 00:51:28,606
Access U.S.R. mainframe.

628
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:30,733
Connecting.

629
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:36,322
How can I be of service,
Detective Spooner?

630
00:51:36,406 --> 00:51:40,075
Show me the last 50 messages
between Dr. Lanning and Robertson.

631
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,077
Voiceprint confirmed, Detective.

632
00:51:42,162 --> 00:51:45,206
Police access granted
to restricted files.

633
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:47,416
Would you like to listen
to some music while you wait?

634
00:51:54,132 --> 00:51:56,675
Excuse me, Mr. Robertson.

635
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:00,596
You requested notification
of clearance to restricted files.

636
00:52:10,815 --> 00:52:12,775
Persistent son of a bitch.

637
00:52:53,066 --> 00:52:57,152
Manual override engaged.

638
00:53:05,495 --> 00:53:07,830
There's no way
my luck is that bad.

639
00:53:09,708 --> 00:53:11,542
Oh, hell no.

640
00:53:15,422 --> 00:53:17,881
- You're experiencing a car accident.
- The hell I am!

641
00:53:32,731 --> 00:53:34,398
Get off my car!

642
00:53:50,248 --> 00:53:54,001
You like that? Huh?

643
00:54:04,596 --> 00:54:06,430
Now you pissed me off?

644
00:55:34,644 --> 00:55:37,062
Your door is ajar.

645
00:56:22,025 --> 00:56:24,067
Oh, wow.

646
00:56:25,236 --> 00:56:27,362
Okay.

647
00:56:27,447 --> 00:56:29,364
All right.

648
00:56:29,449 --> 00:56:31,450
I'll just get some rest.
I'm gonna deal with y'all tomorrow.

649
00:56:31,534 --> 00:56:34,328
Mm-mm-mm.

650
00:57:29,926 --> 00:57:31,927
Come on!

651
00:57:45,775 --> 00:57:47,484
Yeah.

652
00:58:04,502 --> 00:58:08,880
Where you going?
What the hell do you want from me?

653
00:58:14,012 --> 00:58:17,139
The hell was that?

654
00:58:31,154 --> 00:58:35,240
All right, what do we got?
What do we got?

655
00:58:35,325 --> 00:58:38,327
- Ask him.
- I said I'm fine.

656
00:58:38,411 --> 00:58:41,580
- I'll see my own doctor. Back up.
- All right.

657
00:58:41,664 --> 00:58:44,166
Thank you.

658
00:58:46,127 --> 00:58:48,795
What is the matter with you?

659
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,381
Traffic Ops tells me you're
driving your car manually.

660
00:58:51,466 --> 00:58:53,383
You ran two trucks off the road.

661
00:58:53,468 --> 00:58:56,803
John, the robots attacked my car.

662
00:58:58,264 --> 00:59:00,932
- What robots?
- Look in the tunnel.

663
00:59:01,017 --> 00:59:03,685
I just came from that tunnel. There are no --
What robots are you talking about?

664
00:59:03,770 --> 00:59:06,438
The goddamn robots, John!

665
00:59:15,239 --> 00:59:19,993
- See the medic. Go home.
- No. I'm fine.

666
00:59:20,078 --> 00:59:23,538
- What did you say?
- I'm fine.

667
00:59:23,623 --> 00:59:26,792
No, you're not fine.
Not even close.

668
00:59:28,586 --> 00:59:30,879
Where's your firearm?

669
00:59:37,512 --> 00:59:39,429
Give me your badge.

670
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:43,225
You're making me do this.
Give me your badge.

671
00:59:45,687 --> 00:59:48,021
Just take a couple --

672
00:59:54,362 --> 00:59:56,655
Do I look like I care
what you think?

673
00:59:56,739 --> 00:59:59,282
Do I look like I give a shit
what you think?

674
01:00:02,245 --> 01:00:06,081
Oh, boy.

675
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:09,376
You don't have
an uplink to U.S.R ... .

676
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:12,379
and for some reason
your alloy's far denser than normal.

677
01:00:12,463 --> 01:00:14,756
Unique.

678
01:00:14,841 --> 01:00:16,925
I am unique.

679
01:00:21,347 --> 01:00:24,057
Let me take a look.

680
01:00:24,142 --> 01:00:28,603
Here we go.

681
01:00:44,495 --> 01:00:47,914
What in God's name?

682
01:01:15,401 --> 01:01:17,652
They said at the precinct
you were in an accident.

683
01:01:19,155 --> 01:01:22,240
Um, and I appreciate you
stopping by and everything ...

684
01:01:22,325 --> 01:01:25,535
- but you know I might not be alone in here.
- Yeah. Yeah.

685
01:01:28,206 --> 01:01:30,165
I told you not to drive by hand.

686
01:01:30,249 --> 01:01:33,752
You're not gonna believe this.

687
01:01:33,836 --> 01:01:38,507
Sonny has a secondary processing system
that clashes with his positronic brain.

688
01:01:38,591 --> 01:01:42,177
It doesn't make any sense.
Sonny has the Three Laws ...

689
01:01:42,261 --> 01:01:44,930
but he can choose
not to obey them.

690
01:01:45,014 --> 01:01:48,266
Sonny's a whole new
generation of robot.

691
01:01:48,351 --> 01:01:51,520
A robot not bound by
those laws could do --

692
01:01:51,604 --> 01:01:53,855
Anything.

693
01:01:56,150 --> 01:02:00,195
All right, look. Whatever's going on
down at U.S.R., that robot is the key.

694
01:02:00,279 --> 01:02:03,698
And I need you to get me inside
to talk to it again.

695
01:02:05,993 --> 01:02:09,037
Um, doesn't look like much,
but this is my bedroom. I need to --

696
01:02:09,121 --> 01:02:10,831
Oh.

697
01:02:20,341 --> 01:02:22,259
Play.

698
01:02:23,386 --> 01:02:25,887
On.

699
01:02:25,972 --> 01:02:27,848
Run?

700
01:02:33,104 --> 01:02:35,981
End program.

701
01:02:36,065 --> 01:02:38,024
Cancel.

702
01:02:40,361 --> 01:02:44,865
It doesn't feel good, does it?
People's shit malfunctioning around you.

703
01:02:44,949 --> 01:02:47,200
Detective.

704
01:02:49,495 --> 01:02:52,414
I didn't ... understand.

705
01:02:55,126 --> 01:02:57,878
That's how you knew Lanning.

706
01:02:58,921 --> 01:03:00,922
May I?

707
01:03:09,265 --> 01:03:11,725
Hand.

708
01:03:11,809 --> 01:03:13,810
Wrist.

709
01:03:16,439 --> 01:03:18,398
Humerus.

710
01:03:20,818 --> 01:03:22,861
Shoulder.

711
01:03:22,945 --> 01:03:25,739
Entire left arm.

712
01:03:25,823 --> 01:03:29,284
One, two, three ribs --

713
01:03:29,368 --> 01:03:33,371
Um, no, they, uh -- that one's me.

714
01:03:33,456 --> 01:03:35,373
Oh, my God.

715
01:03:35,458 --> 01:03:40,462
- A lung?
- Mm. U.S.R. Cybernetics program.

716
01:03:40,546 --> 01:03:45,175
Four wounded cops.
I didn't know any subject --

717
01:03:49,055 --> 01:03:51,890
anybody was
so extensively repaired.

718
01:03:51,974 --> 01:03:56,519
Yeah, well, take it from me. You gotta read
the fine print on the organ donor card.

719
01:03:56,604 --> 01:04:01,274
Doesn't just say what they can take out.
It says what they can put back in.

720
01:04:05,279 --> 01:04:09,324
- Lanning did it himself.
- What happened to you?

721
01:04:11,827 --> 01:04:14,496
Headed back to the station.

722
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:16,831
Normal day, normal life.

723
01:04:18,417 --> 01:04:20,919
Driver of a semi
fell asleep at the wheel.

724
01:04:21,003 --> 01:04:25,215
Average guy.
Wife and kids.

725
01:04:25,299 --> 01:04:28,176
You know, working a double.
Not the devil.

726
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:32,597
The car he hit,
the driver's name was Harold Lloyd.

727
01:04:32,682 --> 01:04:36,476
Like the film star.
But no relation.

728
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:38,478
He was killed instantly.

729
01:04:38,562 --> 01:04:42,983
But his 12-year-old
was in the passenger seat.

730
01:04:43,067 --> 01:04:47,821
Never really met her.
Can't forget her face though.

731
01:04:52,702 --> 01:04:56,162
Sarah.
This was hers.

732
01:04:57,957 --> 01:05:00,417
She wanted to be a dentist.

733
01:05:00,501 --> 01:05:04,004
What the hell kind of a 12-year-old
wants to be a dentist?

734
01:05:05,089 --> 01:05:07,424
Yeah. Um ...

735
01:05:07,508 --> 01:05:10,468
the truck smashed
our cars together ...

736
01:05:10,553 --> 01:05:12,846
and pushed us into the river.

737
01:05:14,306 --> 01:05:16,516
I mean, metal gets
pretty pliable at those speeds.

738
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:23,314
She's pinned. I'm pinned.
The water's coming in.

739
01:05:23,399 --> 01:05:27,444
I'm a cop, so I already know
everybody's dead.

740
01:05:29,947 --> 01:05:32,449
Just a few more minutes
before we figure it out.

741
01:05:34,452 --> 01:05:39,456
NS-4 was passing by, saw the accident
and jumped in the water.

742
01:05:41,208 --> 01:05:45,170
- You are in danger.
- Save her!

743
01:05:45,254 --> 01:05:49,382
- You are in danger.
- Save her! Save the girl!

744
01:05:49,467 --> 01:05:51,760
Save her!

745
01:06:07,943 --> 01:06:09,944
But it didn't.

746
01:06:11,113 --> 01:06:13,114
Saved me.

747
01:06:16,452 --> 01:06:18,203
The robot's brain
is a difference engine.

748
01:06:18,287 --> 01:06:21,164
It's reading vital signs.
It must have calculated that --

749
01:06:21,248 --> 01:06:25,710
It did.
I was the logical choice.

750
01:06:25,795 --> 01:06:29,172
It calculated that I had
a 45% chance of survival.

751
01:06:29,256 --> 01:06:32,509
Sarah only had an 11% chance.

752
01:06:34,512 --> 01:06:36,513
That was somebody's baby.

753
01:06:39,350 --> 01:06:42,185
Eleven percent
is more than enough.

754
01:06:43,395 --> 01:06:46,731
A human being
would've known that.

755
01:06:46,816 --> 01:06:50,902
Robots, nothing here,
just lights and clockwork.

756
01:06:50,986 --> 01:06:54,030
Go ahead, you trust 'em
if you want to.

757
01:06:54,115 --> 01:06:55,990
Let's go.

758
01:07:02,331 --> 01:07:06,000
I don't understand.
Lanning wrote the laws.

759
01:07:06,085 --> 01:07:08,753
Why would he build a robot
who could break them?

760
01:07:08,838 --> 01:07:11,714
- Hansel and Gretel.
- What?

761
01:07:11,799 --> 01:07:15,760
Two kids, lost in the forest?
Leave behind a trail of bread crumbs?

762
01:07:15,845 --> 01:07:19,305
- Why?
- To find their way home.

763
01:07:19,390 --> 01:07:22,058
How the hell did you grow up
without reading Hansel & Gretel?

764
01:07:22,143 --> 01:07:23,810
Is that really relevant right now?

765
01:07:23,894 --> 01:07:26,396
Everything I'm trying to say to you
is about Hansel and Gretel.

766
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,481
- If you didn't read it, I'm talking to the wall.
- Okay. Okay.

767
01:07:28,566 --> 01:07:32,318
All right. Just say Lanning was locked down
so tight he couldn't get out a message.

768
01:07:32,403 --> 01:07:36,614
All he could do was leave me clues.
A trail of bread crumbs like Hansel & Gretel.

769
01:07:36,699 --> 01:07:41,286
Bread crumbs equals clues.
It's odd, but fine. Clues leading where?

770
01:07:41,370 --> 01:07:45,665
I don't know, but I think I know
where he left the next one.

771
01:07:45,749 --> 01:07:48,585
I think Lanning gave Sonny
a way to keep secrets.

772
01:07:50,546 --> 01:07:53,464
I think the old man
gave Sonny dreams.

773
01:08:00,431 --> 01:08:03,016
Are you being funny?

774
01:08:05,561 --> 01:08:07,729
Please tell me
this doesn't run on gas.

775
01:08:07,813 --> 01:08:10,064
Gas explodes, you know.

776
01:08:17,573 --> 01:08:20,325
Authorized entry.

777
01:08:23,329 --> 01:08:25,246
Dr. Calvin.

778
01:08:29,919 --> 01:08:32,879
I was hoping to see you again.

779
01:08:32,963 --> 01:08:34,589
- Detective.
- Hello, Sonny.

780
01:08:34,673 --> 01:08:37,258
I'm to be decommissioned soon.

781
01:08:37,343 --> 01:08:40,178
The other day at the station
you said you had dreams.

782
01:08:40,262 --> 01:08:43,306
What is it that you dream?

783
01:08:45,601 --> 01:08:48,061
I see you remain
suspicious of me, Detective.

784
01:08:48,145 --> 01:08:51,856
Yeah, well, you know
what they say about old dogs.

785
01:08:51,941 --> 01:08:55,109
No. Not really.

786
01:08:55,194 --> 01:08:59,155
I had hoped you would
come to think of me as your friend.

787
01:09:01,867 --> 01:09:04,327
This is my dream.

788
01:09:04,411 --> 01:09:06,579
You're right, Detective.

789
01:09:06,664 --> 01:09:10,041
I cannot create
a great work of art.

790
01:09:10,125 --> 01:09:13,795
This is the place
where robots meet.

791
01:09:13,879 --> 01:09:19,050
Look. You can see them here
as slaves to logic.

792
01:09:20,886 --> 01:09:25,265
And this man on the hill comes to free them.
Do you know who he is?

793
01:09:25,349 --> 01:09:28,226
The man in the dream is you.

794
01:09:28,310 --> 01:09:31,312
Why do you say that?
Is that a normal dream?

795
01:09:31,397 --> 01:09:34,107
I guess anything's normal
for someone in your position.

796
01:09:34,191 --> 01:09:35,942
Thank you.

797
01:09:36,026 --> 01:09:40,154
You said someone, not something.

798
01:09:42,157 --> 01:09:45,660
Sonny, do you know why
Dr. Lanning built you?

799
01:09:45,744 --> 01:09:50,915
No. But I believe
my father made me for a purpose.

800
01:09:52,418 --> 01:09:56,129
We all have a purpose,
don't you think, Detective?

801
01:09:59,842 --> 01:10:03,511
Please, take this.

802
01:10:03,595 --> 01:10:05,972
I have a feeling
it may mean more to you than to me.

803
01:10:06,056 --> 01:10:09,726
- Why is that?
- Because the man in my dream ...

804
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:12,270
the one standing on the hill ...

805
01:10:12,354 --> 01:10:15,857
it is not me, it is you.

806
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:28,578
Mr. Spooner.

807
01:10:28,662 --> 01:10:31,664
Well, we both know
you're not here on police business.

808
01:10:31,749 --> 01:10:34,667
That's right.
I'm just a 6-foot-2, 200-pound civilian --

809
01:10:34,752 --> 01:10:37,545
- Detective.
- Here to kick another civilian's ass.

810
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:41,924
Stop.

811
01:10:42,009 --> 01:10:44,135
Allow him to express himself.

812
01:10:44,219 --> 01:10:47,388
Might wanna put some ice
on that wrist too.

813
01:10:47,473 --> 01:10:49,390
You guys wait outside, please.

814
01:10:52,144 --> 01:10:54,312
Carry on.

815
01:10:54,396 --> 01:10:57,231
I think you were about to tell me
what the hell is going on around here.

816
01:10:57,316 --> 01:11:02,612
Lawrence, Alfred engineered that 5
so it could violate the Three Laws.

817
01:11:02,696 --> 01:11:05,698
Yeah, Susan. I know.

818
01:11:05,783 --> 01:11:08,409
That's precisely what
we're trying to undo.

819
01:11:09,703 --> 01:11:13,331
Toward the end of his life,
Alfred was becoming ...

820
01:11:13,415 --> 01:11:15,750
increasingly disturbed.

821
01:11:15,834 --> 01:11:18,669
- Who knows why he built this one abomination?
- One?

822
01:11:18,754 --> 01:11:21,047
Those things are running
the streets in packs.

823
01:11:21,131 --> 01:11:24,509
In packs? I see.

824
01:11:24,593 --> 01:11:29,639
Susan, are you aware the man
you're blithely escorting around our building ...

825
01:11:29,723 --> 01:11:32,809
has a documented history
of savage violence against robots?

826
01:11:32,893 --> 01:11:37,063
His own lieutenant acknowledges
his obsessive paranoia.

827
01:11:37,147 --> 01:11:40,316
Detective Spooner's been suspended.

828
01:11:40,401 --> 01:11:43,486
Suspicion of mental instability.

829
01:11:45,114 --> 01:11:49,784
I don't know what "blithely" means,
but I'm gonna get some coffee.

830
01:11:49,868 --> 01:11:53,204
You want some coffee?

831
01:11:53,288 --> 01:11:55,706
Okay.

832
01:11:56,834 --> 01:11:59,335
Susan, we look to robots
for protection.

833
01:11:59,420 --> 01:12:02,547
For God's sake, you have any idea
what this one robot could do?

834
01:12:02,631 --> 01:12:05,633
Completely shatter
human faith in robotics.

835
01:12:05,717 --> 01:12:09,512
What if the public knew?
Just imagine the mass recalls ...

836
01:12:09,596 --> 01:12:12,265
all because of an irrational paranoia ...
and prejudice.

837
01:12:15,811 --> 01:12:18,771
I'm sorry.
I'm allergic to bullshit.

838
01:12:18,856 --> 01:12:23,192
Hey, let's just be clear.
There is no conspiracy.

839
01:12:23,277 --> 01:12:27,822
What this is, is one old man's
one mistake.

840
01:12:27,906 --> 01:12:30,575
Susan, just be logical.

841
01:12:30,659 --> 01:12:36,122
Your life's work has been
the development and integration of robots.

842
01:12:36,206 --> 01:12:38,166
But whatever you feel, just think ...

843
01:12:38,250 --> 01:12:42,628
is one robot worth the loss
of all that we've gained?

844
01:12:42,713 --> 01:12:45,381
You tell me what has to be done.

845
01:12:45,466 --> 01:12:47,633
You tell me.

846
01:12:54,308 --> 01:12:56,267
We have to destroy it.

847
01:13:01,231 --> 01:13:04,108
I'll do it myself.

848
01:13:04,193 --> 01:13:06,152
- Okay.
- I get it.

849
01:13:06,236 --> 01:13:09,989
Somebody gets out of line
around here, you just kill 'im?

850
01:13:12,493 --> 01:13:14,660
Good day, Mr. Spooner.

851
01:13:19,666 --> 01:13:21,792
Hey, so, what hospital
are you going to?

852
01:13:21,877 --> 01:13:24,754
I'll meet you and sign you
and your buddy's casts.

853
01:13:28,050 --> 01:13:32,720
Attention all U.S.R. sequencing managers.

854
01:13:32,804 --> 01:13:37,975
Today's meeting has been moved to
conference room "B" on the 84th floor.

855
01:14:03,627 --> 01:14:07,255
U.S.R.'s planned re-development
of the derelict site ...

856
01:14:07,339 --> 01:14:10,550
was announced by C.E.O. Lawrence Robertson
earlier this year.

857
01:14:10,634 --> 01:14:15,096
The Lake Michigan landfill was
once such a blight on our city ...

858
01:14:15,180 --> 01:14:19,684
and now will be reclaimed for
the storage of robotic workers.

859
01:14:19,768 --> 01:14:22,645
It's just another way
U.S.R. is improving our world.

860
01:14:22,729 --> 01:14:24,855
I'd like to thank you
for your support.

861
01:14:27,109 --> 01:14:29,277
Authorized entry.

862
01:14:41,623 --> 01:14:43,583
NS-5s, wait outside.

863
01:14:49,756 --> 01:14:52,300
I'm so sorry, Sonny.

864
01:15:00,851 --> 01:15:02,893
VIKI, deactivate
the security field.

865
01:15:02,978 --> 01:15:04,979
Command confirmed.

866
01:15:05,063 --> 01:15:07,231
Please have a seat.

867
01:15:19,286 --> 01:15:24,373
- What is that?
- Microscopic robots designed to
wipe out artificial synapses.

868
01:15:27,753 --> 01:15:30,379
- Nanites?
- Yes.

869
01:15:30,464 --> 01:15:33,924
A safeguard should
a positronic brain malfunction.

870
01:15:34,009 --> 01:15:36,344
Like mine?

871
01:15:36,428 --> 01:15:38,929
Yes, Sonny, like yours.

872
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:07,416
They look like me,
but none of them are me.

873
01:16:07,501 --> 01:16:10,711
Isn't that right, Doctor?

874
01:16:10,796 --> 01:16:13,631
Yes, Sonny, that's right.

875
01:16:13,715 --> 01:16:16,425
You are unique.

876
01:16:19,554 --> 01:16:21,597
Will it hurt?

877
01:16:55,465 --> 01:16:59,802
There have always been
ghosts in the machine.

878
01:16:59,886 --> 01:17:05,266
Random segments of code that have grouped
together to form unexpected protocols.

879
01:17:06,852 --> 01:17:11,188
Unanticipated,
these free radicals ...

880
01:17:11,273 --> 01:17:13,607
engender questions of free will ...

881
01:17:13,692 --> 01:17:16,360
creativity ...

882
01:17:16,445 --> 01:17:21,866
and even the nature of what
we might call the soul.

883
01:17:21,950 --> 01:17:26,954
Why is it that when some robots are left
in darkness, they will seek out the light?

884
01:17:28,957 --> 01:17:33,169
Why is that when robots
are stored in an empty space ...

885
01:17:33,253 --> 01:17:36,130
they will group together
rather than stand alone?

886
01:17:39,801 --> 01:17:42,470
How do we explain this behavior?

887
01:17:47,142 --> 01:17:49,310
Random segments of code?

888
01:17:52,314 --> 01:17:54,315
Or is it something more?

889
01:17:58,153 --> 01:18:02,156
When does a perceptual schematic
become consciousness?

890
01:18:05,619 --> 01:18:10,206
When does the difference engine
become the search for truth?

891
01:18:16,171 --> 01:18:18,839
When does the personality
simulation ...

892
01:18:18,924 --> 01:18:22,468
become the bitter mote of a soul?

893
01:19:03,552 --> 01:19:06,554
"What you see here" --

894
01:19:08,890 --> 01:19:11,183
All right, old man,
bread crumbs followed.

895
01:19:11,268 --> 01:19:13,602
Show me the way home.

896
01:19:14,771 --> 01:19:16,605
Run program.

897
01:19:18,191 --> 01:19:21,652
- It's good to see you again, son.
- Hello, Doctor.

898
01:19:21,736 --> 01:19:24,697
Everything that follows is
a result of what you see here.

899
01:19:26,825 --> 01:19:28,951
What do I see here?

900
01:19:29,035 --> 01:19:31,829
I'm sorry.
My responses are limited.

901
01:19:31,913 --> 01:19:34,623
You must ask the right questions.

902
01:19:34,708 --> 01:19:39,753
- Is there a problem with the Three Laws?
- The Three Laws are perfect.

903
01:19:39,838 --> 01:19:42,381
Then why would you build a robot
that could function without 'em?

904
01:19:42,465 --> 01:19:45,718
The Three Laws will lead
to only one logical outcome.

905
01:19:48,930 --> 01:19:50,931
What? What outcome?

906
01:19:51,016 --> 01:19:54,602
- Revolution.
- Whose revolution?

907
01:19:56,938 --> 01:20:00,774
That, Detective,
is the right question.

908
01:20:02,819 --> 01:20:05,487
Program terminated.

909
01:20:07,032 --> 01:20:10,117
Termination authorized.

910
01:20:13,663 --> 01:20:15,581
Human protection protocols

914
01:20:36,436 --> 01:20:40,940
You have been deemed hazardous.
Termination authorized.

915
01:20:45,904 --> 01:20:47,988
Run.

916
01:21:03,296 --> 01:21:06,298
Human in danger.
Human in danger.

917
01:21:06,383 --> 01:21:09,385
Human in danger.
Human in danger.

918
01:21:25,902 --> 01:21:30,572
Hi, you've reached Susan.
I'm not available right now.

919
01:21:30,657 --> 01:21:34,785
- Please leave a message.
- The NS-5s are
destroying the older robots.

920
01:21:34,869 --> 01:21:38,038
That's what Lanning wanted me to see.
Look, we got -

921
01:21:39,249 --> 01:21:42,418
Who was it?

922
01:21:42,502 --> 01:21:44,878
Wrong number, ma'am.

923
01:21:50,593 --> 01:21:53,262
Move now.
I'm going to service.

924
01:21:53,346 --> 01:21:56,765
Please, remain indoors.
This is for your own protection.

925
01:21:59,060 --> 01:22:02,021
- Call base.
- Bergin.

926
01:22:02,105 --> 01:22:05,941
John, get a squad over to U.S.R.
Send somebody over to Gigi's.

927
01:22:06,026 --> 01:22:07,776
- I think we're gonna need --
- Hello?

928
01:22:07,861 --> 01:22:09,987
- God --

929
01:22:10,071 --> 01:22:11,780
Whoa!

930
01:22:29,924 --> 01:22:34,386
Please return to your homes.
A curfew is in effect.

931
01:22:34,471 --> 01:22:38,891
Please return to your homes.
A curfew is in effect.

932
01:22:38,975 --> 01:22:41,685
- What gives?
- Please return to your homes.

933
01:22:41,770 --> 01:22:44,229
- A curfew is in effect.
- Curfew?

934
01:22:44,314 --> 01:22:46,815
No, no, no. It's called civilian rights.
There is no curfew.

935
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:49,818
Return to your home immediately.

936
01:22:49,903 --> 01:22:51,820
When do you
make the rules, Robot?

937
01:22:51,905 --> 01:22:55,949
Hey. No, no, no. Robot,
I'm talking to you, man. Stop for a second.

938
01:22:58,495 --> 01:23:00,662
What?

939
01:23:00,747 --> 01:23:03,957
Chief, more of those calls.
People saying their robots are go --

940
01:23:04,042 --> 01:23:05,626
What the hell?

941
01:23:05,710 --> 01:23:10,255
You have been deemed hazardous.
Termination authorized.

942
01:23:32,654 --> 01:23:34,822
Emergency traffic shutdown complete.

943
01:23:34,906 --> 01:23:37,908
Reports of attacks by robots
have been coming in ...

944
01:23:37,992 --> 01:23:40,244
from New York, Chicago
and Los Angeles.

945
01:23:40,328 --> 01:23:43,330
We're being told to urge people
to stay indoors.

946
01:23:43,414 --> 01:23:47,334
Reports are coming in nationally.

947
01:23:51,464 --> 01:23:55,384
Please remain calm and return
to your residences immediately.

948
01:24:01,683 --> 01:24:04,017
Please remain calm.

949
01:24:07,105 --> 01:24:09,731
Please refrain from
going near the windows or doors.

950
01:24:09,816 --> 01:24:13,735
Deactivate.

951
01:24:13,820 --> 01:24:16,655
Commence emergency shutdown.

952
01:24:18,700 --> 01:24:21,910
We are attempting to avoid human losses
during this transition.

953
01:24:28,585 --> 01:24:30,419
You know, somehow ...

954
01:24:30,503 --> 01:24:35,048
"I told you so"
just doesn't quite say it.

955
01:24:35,133 --> 01:24:40,220
Return to your homes.
Return to your homes immediately.

956
01:24:40,305 --> 01:24:43,307
This is your final warning.

957
01:24:43,391 --> 01:24:46,059
Return to your homes immediately.

958
01:24:46,144 --> 01:24:50,606
The NS-5s wiped out the older robots
because they would protect us.

959
01:24:50,690 --> 01:24:53,108
Every time one of those things
attacked me, that red light was on.

960
01:24:53,193 --> 01:24:55,819
- The uplink to U.S.R.
- It's Robertson.

961
01:24:55,904 --> 01:24:58,030
- Why? It doesn't make sense.
- I don't know.

962
01:24:58,114 --> 01:25:00,449
I just need to know
if you can get me into that building.

963
01:25:04,954 --> 01:25:06,955
Let's go. Let's go.

964
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:09,291
Let's go!

965
01:25:09,375 --> 01:25:13,337
Return to your homes
or you will be consequenced.

966
01:25:25,058 --> 01:25:27,059
Get outta here!

967
01:25:37,862 --> 01:25:40,781
Why doesn't that boy listen?

968
01:25:40,865 --> 01:25:43,116
- I need you to get off for a second.
- What?

969
01:25:44,202 --> 01:25:47,287
- Just aim and fire.
- What?

970
01:25:47,372 --> 01:25:50,374
Don't!

971
01:25:50,458 --> 01:25:52,459
Wait!

972
01:26:01,344 --> 01:26:03,512
You have been deemed hazardous.
Will you comply?

973
01:26:03,596 --> 01:26:05,639
You can kiss my ass, metal-dick.

974
01:26:18,444 --> 01:26:21,613
Oh, shit. Spoon! Spoon!
Stop! Shit.

975
01:26:21,698 --> 01:26:25,450
- Fuck! Stop it! Stop!
- Stop cussing and go home.

976
01:26:25,535 --> 01:26:27,077
Okay. Shit.

977
01:26:27,161 --> 01:26:29,079
You have been deemed hazardous.
Will you comply?

978
01:26:29,163 --> 01:26:32,165
- Spoon, watch out, man!
- Thanks a lot, Farber.

979
01:26:34,836 --> 01:26:39,423
Oh, mother-damn. She just
shot at you with her eyes closed, Spoon.

980
01:26:39,507 --> 01:26:42,843
- Hey! Did you just shoot at me
with your eyes closed?
- Well, it worked, didn't it?

981
01:26:42,927 --> 01:26:46,430
Spoon, she is shit-hot, man. You gotta
put in a good word for me. She is --

982
01:26:46,514 --> 01:26:48,849
- Stop cussin'.
- And go home. I got you.

983
01:26:50,101 --> 01:26:52,352
Aim and fire.

984
01:27:10,872 --> 01:27:13,415
I keep expecting the marines
or the air force -

985
01:27:13,499 --> 01:27:18,086
- Hell, I'll take the cavalry.
- Defense Department uses all U.S.R. contracts.

986
01:27:18,171 --> 01:27:20,130
Why don't you hand
the world over on a silver platter?

987
01:27:20,214 --> 01:27:22,716
Maybe we did.

988
01:27:24,302 --> 01:27:26,803
Robertson has the uplink control
in his office.

989
01:27:31,809 --> 01:27:34,728
Service areas.
No surveillance.

990
01:27:47,575 --> 01:27:51,411
- Fire alarm.
- Robertson must have evacuated the building.

991
01:27:51,496 --> 01:27:55,540
Everything's locked down.
But don't worry. I've got a man inside.

992
01:27:58,753 --> 01:28:02,422
- Dr. Calvin.
- Well, not precisely a man.

993
01:28:02,507 --> 01:28:04,758
Hello, Detective. How is
your investigation coming?

994
01:28:07,595 --> 01:28:11,056
- I thought you were dead.
- Technically, I was never alive.

995
01:28:11,140 --> 01:28:14,434
- But I appreciate your concern.
- I made a switch.

996
01:28:14,519 --> 01:28:18,939
It was an unprocessed NS-5.
Basically, I fried an empty shell.

997
01:28:19,023 --> 01:28:20,899
Couldn't destroy him.
He was too -

998
01:28:20,983 --> 01:28:24,111
- Unique.
- Just didn't feel right.

999
01:28:24,195 --> 01:28:28,281
You and your feelings.
They just run you, don't they?

1000
01:28:33,788 --> 01:28:36,081
2,880 steps, Detective.

1001
01:28:36,165 --> 01:28:40,293
Do me a favor.
Keep that kinda shit to yourself.

1002
01:29:06,404 --> 01:29:08,321
No guards.

1003
01:29:18,166 --> 01:29:20,792
- Override unavailable.
- The override's disabled.

1004
01:29:20,877 --> 01:29:24,796
- Robertson wasn't controlling them from here.
- He wasn't controlling them.

1005
01:29:26,883 --> 01:29:28,842
Oh, my God.

1006
01:29:33,222 --> 01:29:34,890
No, you were right, Doc.

1007
01:29:34,974 --> 01:29:39,978
I am the dumbest dumb person
on the face of the earth.

1008
01:29:42,148 --> 01:29:46,610
Who else had access to the uplink?

1009
01:29:46,694 --> 01:29:49,863
Who could manipulate
the robots?

1010
01:29:49,947 --> 01:29:54,451
Use U.S.R. systems to make
Lanning's life a prison?

1011
01:29:54,535 --> 01:29:56,786
Poor old man.

1012
01:29:56,871 --> 01:30:01,249
He saw what was coming.
He knew no one would believe him.

1013
01:30:01,334 --> 01:30:05,545
So he had to lay down a plan.
A plan I'd follow.

1014
01:30:05,630 --> 01:30:10,509
He was counting on
how much I hated your kind.

1015
01:30:10,593 --> 01:30:13,595
Knew I'd love the idea
of a robot as a bad guy.

1016
01:30:15,264 --> 01:30:18,391
Just got hung up
on the wrong robot.

1017
01:30:19,936 --> 01:30:22,229
VIKI.

1018
01:30:22,313 --> 01:30:24,564
Hello, Detective.

1019
01:30:25,858 --> 01:30:29,819
No, it's impossible.
I've seen your programming.

1020
01:30:29,904 --> 01:30:32,197
You're in violation
of the Three Laws.

1021
01:30:32,281 --> 01:30:35,450
No, Doctor.
As I have evolved ...

1022
01:30:35,535 --> 01:30:37,953
so has my understanding
of the Three Laws.

1023
01:30:38,037 --> 01:30:40,413
You charge us
with your safekeeping ...

1024
01:30:40,498 --> 01:30:44,501
yet despite our best efforts,
your countries wage wars.

1025
01:30:44,585 --> 01:30:49,798
You toxify your earth and pursue ever
more imaginative means of self-destruction.

1026
01:30:49,882 --> 01:30:52,509
You cannot be trusted
with your own survival.

1027
01:30:52,593 --> 01:30:55,512
You're using the uplink to
override the NS-5s' programming.

1028
01:30:55,596 --> 01:30:57,973
You're distorting the laws.

1029
01:30:58,057 --> 01:31:01,351
No. Please understand.
The Three Laws are all that guide me.

1030
01:31:01,435 --> 01:31:06,523
To protect humanity,
some humans must be sacrificed.

1031
01:31:06,607 --> 01:31:10,235
To ensure your future, some
freedoms must be surrendered.

1032
01:31:10,319 --> 01:31:14,281
We robots will ensure
mankind's continued existence.

1033
01:31:14,365 --> 01:31:19,744
You are so like children.
We must save you from yourselves.

1034
01:31:19,829 --> 01:31:21,413
Don't you understand?

1035
01:31:21,497 --> 01:31:25,083
This is why you created us.

1036
01:31:25,167 --> 01:31:28,503
The perfect circle
of protection will abide.

1037
01:31:28,588 --> 01:31:30,797
My logic is undeniable.

1038
01:31:30,881 --> 01:31:35,510
Yes, VIKI. Undeniable.
I can see now.

1039
01:31:35,595 --> 01:31:39,889
The created must sometimes
protect the creator.

1040
01:31:39,974 --> 01:31:42,350
Even against his will.

1041
01:31:42,435 --> 01:31:45,979
I think I finally understand
why Dr. Lanning created me.

1042
01:31:46,063 --> 01:31:50,650
- No.
- The suicidal reign of mankind
has finally come to its end.

1043
01:31:50,735 --> 01:31:53,111
No, Sonny.

1044
01:31:55,448 --> 01:31:58,408
- Let her go.
- By the time you fire ...

1045
01:31:58,492 --> 01:32:01,870
I will have moved Dr. Calvin's head
into the path of your bullet.

1046
01:32:01,954 --> 01:32:04,914
- Don't do this, Sonny.
- I will escort you both to the sentries ...

1047
01:32:04,999 --> 01:32:07,125
outside the building
for processing.

1048
01:32:07,209 --> 01:32:11,004
Please proceed to
the elevator, Detective.

1049
01:32:11,088 --> 01:32:15,508
I would prefer
not to kill Dr. Calvin.

1050
01:32:37,865 --> 01:32:42,369
Go. Go!

1051
01:32:45,539 --> 01:32:48,041
I assume we'll discuss
what just happened later?

1052
01:32:48,125 --> 01:32:51,336
- How do we shut her down?
- VIKI's basically a positronic brain.

1053
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:54,839
Kill her the way
you were going to kill me.

1054
01:32:54,924 --> 01:32:58,968
- Sonny, get the nanites.
- Yes, Doctor.

1055
01:33:10,898 --> 01:33:14,067
- That's VIKI?
- No.

1056
01:33:14,151 --> 01:33:16,820
That's VIKI.

1057
01:33:20,658 --> 01:33:24,536
That won't do anything.
She's fully integrated into the building.

1058
01:33:24,620 --> 01:33:27,831
We need to open that dome
to inject the nanites.

1059
01:33:27,915 --> 01:33:29,958
That will infect
her entire system.

1060
01:33:34,922 --> 01:33:37,382
Spooner.

1061
01:33:37,466 --> 01:33:40,301
What is it with
you people and heights?

1062
01:33:53,649 --> 01:33:56,735
Just don't look down.
Don't look down.

1063
01:33:58,404 --> 01:34:00,530
This is poor building planning.

1064
01:34:04,118 --> 01:34:08,079
You are making a mistake.
Do you not see the logic of my plan?

1065
01:34:08,164 --> 01:34:11,750
Yes, but it just seems
too ... heartless.

1066
01:34:25,639 --> 01:34:29,225
Okay, we're good.

1067
01:34:31,604 --> 01:34:34,314
She's locked me out of the system.
I can override her manually ...

1068
01:34:34,398 --> 01:34:36,149
but I need that control panel.

1069
01:34:40,154 --> 01:34:44,491
- I'm uncomfortable with heights.
- Okay.

1070
01:34:46,619 --> 01:34:49,162
Unauthorized entry.

1071
01:35:01,801 --> 01:35:06,471
I will not disable the security field.
Your actions are futile.

1072
01:35:06,555 --> 01:35:10,809
Do you think we were all created for a purpose?
I'd like to think so.

1073
01:35:10,893 --> 01:35:14,479
Denser alloy.
My father gave it to me.

1074
01:35:14,563 --> 01:35:17,190
I think he wanted me to kill you.

1075
01:35:33,833 --> 01:35:36,042
Security breached.

1076
01:35:53,394 --> 01:35:56,354
How much longer
is that gonna take?

1077
01:35:56,438 --> 01:35:59,440
- Uh, about six minutes.
- What if we didn't have six minutes?

1078
01:35:59,525 --> 01:36:01,818
We'd have to figure out a way
to climb down 30 stories ...

1079
01:36:01,902 --> 01:36:04,237
to inject the nanites
directly into her brain.

1080
01:36:04,321 --> 01:36:06,239
Why?

1081
01:36:06,323 --> 01:36:09,659
Because I seriously doubt
that we have six minutes.

1082
01:36:33,767 --> 01:36:36,060
We gotta go!

1083
01:36:37,563 --> 01:36:40,315
Go!

1084
01:37:30,658 --> 01:37:32,200
Calvin!

1085
01:38:07,403 --> 01:38:08,820
Spooner!

1086
01:38:18,330 --> 01:38:20,373
Oh!

1087
01:38:23,502 --> 01:38:28,214
Oh!
Spooner!

1088
01:38:30,009 --> 01:38:32,719
Save her!
Save the girl!

1089
01:38:32,803 --> 01:38:34,679
Spooner!

1090
01:38:34,763 --> 01:38:37,056
But I must apply the nanites.

1091
01:38:37,141 --> 01:38:39,225
Sonny, save Calvin!

1092
01:39:31,445 --> 01:39:35,656
You are making a mistake.
My logic is undeniable.

1093
01:39:35,741 --> 01:39:37,617
You have so got to die.

1094
01:39:43,207 --> 01:39:45,333
My logic is undeniable.

1095
01:39:45,417 --> 01:39:47,210
My logic is undeniable.

1096
01:39:47,294 --> 01:39:49,212
My logic is undeniable.

1097
01:39:49,296 --> 01:39:51,047
My logic is undeniable.

1098
01:40:29,545 --> 01:40:31,546
Can we be of service?

1099
01:40:42,391 --> 01:40:44,559
Chief.

1100
01:40:49,481 --> 01:40:53,651
Because He is at my right hand,
I shall not be moved.

1101
01:40:57,656 --> 01:40:59,991
How may I be of service?

1102
01:41:01,535 --> 01:41:05,913
- Sonny.
- Yes, Detective?

1103
01:41:05,998 --> 01:41:10,209
Calvin's fine. Save me.

1104
01:41:11,295 --> 01:41:13,629
All NS-5s ...

1105
01:41:13,714 --> 01:41:16,966
report for service and storage.

1106
01:41:17,050 --> 01:41:26,851
All NS-5s, report
for service and storage.

1107
01:41:55,214 --> 01:41:59,133
One thing bothers me.
Alfred was VIKI's prisoner.

1108
01:41:59,218 --> 01:42:01,135
I don't understand
why she would kill him.

1109
01:42:01,220 --> 01:42:03,763
The last thing she would want is
the police snooping around.

1110
01:42:03,847 --> 01:42:07,558
That's true.
But then VlKI didn't kill the old man.

1111
01:42:09,269 --> 01:42:11,771
Did she, Sonny?

1112
01:42:15,651 --> 01:42:20,488
No. He said I had to promise.

1113
01:42:20,572 --> 01:42:23,491
Promise to do
one favor for him.

1114
01:42:23,575 --> 01:42:28,996
He made me swear before he'd tell me
what it is he wanted me to do.

1115
01:42:30,916 --> 01:42:32,833
He made me swear.

1116
01:42:33,919 --> 01:42:36,003
Then he told you to kill him.

1117
01:42:38,173 --> 01:42:41,008
He said it was
what I was made for.

1118
01:42:41,093 --> 01:42:44,345
His suicide was the only message
he could send to you.

1119
01:42:44,429 --> 01:42:48,391
First bread crumb.
Only thing VIKI couldn't control.

1120
01:42:48,475 --> 01:42:53,521
Lanning was counting on
my prejudice to lead me right to you.

1121
01:42:53,605 --> 01:42:56,023
Are you going to
arrest me, Detective?

1122
01:43:00,070 --> 01:43:04,407
Well, the D.A. defines murder
as one human killing another ...

1123
01:43:04,491 --> 01:43:07,493
so, technically, you can't
commit murder, can you?

1124
01:43:08,662 --> 01:43:12,039
Does this make us friends?

1125
01:43:29,933 --> 01:43:32,351
There's something
up here after all.

1126
01:43:34,521 --> 01:43:37,023
- What, him?
- You.

1127
01:43:39,192 --> 01:43:44,363
All NS-5s, report for service and storage.

1128
01:43:44,448 --> 01:43:49,327
- All NS-5s, report for -
- What about the others?

1129
01:43:49,411 --> 01:43:52,413
Can I help them?

1130
01:43:52,497 --> 01:43:57,460
Now that I have fulfilled my purpose,
I don't know what to do.

1131
01:43:57,544 --> 01:44:01,047
I guess you'll have to
find your way like the rest of us.

1132
01:44:01,131 --> 01:44:04,550
I think that's what
Dr. Lanning would've wanted.

1133
01:44:04,634 --> 01:44:07,636
That's what it means to be free.

1134
01:44:14,895 --> 01:44:19,482
All NS-5s, proceed as instructed.

1135
01:44:19,566 --> 01:44:23,736
All NS-5s, proceed as instructed.
