00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
THE THREE MUSKETEERS (2011)

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,074
-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.com ] ==-

3
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:53,199
It is the dawn of the 17th century.

4
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,037
After the assassination of his father,

5
00:00:57,122 --> 00:01:00,499
the young King Louis XIII
ascends to the French throne.

6
00:01:02,544 --> 00:01:06,298
His once peaceful nation
is surrounded by enemies on all sides.

7
00:01:09,594 --> 00:01:13,513
Within the borders of France itself,
Cardinal Richelieu, the King's advisor,

8
00:01:13,598 --> 00:01:16,183
plots in secret to seize power for himself.

9
00:01:16,852 --> 00:01:19,896
The inexperienced Louis
and his new bride, Queen Anne,

10
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,064
find themselves without a single friend.

11
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:25,027
Europe is a powder keg waiting to explode

12
00:01:25,111 --> 00:01:27,738
in a war that will engulf
the entire continent.

13
00:01:28,615 --> 00:01:31,909
And only a few men
can prevent the coming apocalypse.

14
00:02:32,227 --> 00:02:33,811
Move out!

15
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,524
Halt!

16
00:03:00,758 --> 00:03:01,925
Don't.

17
00:03:02,593 --> 00:03:03,719
Getting careless?

18
00:03:04,429 --> 00:03:06,346
The feeling is mutual.

19
00:03:14,106 --> 00:03:17,442
For future reference, "I love you"
would have been a more suitable reply.

20
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:22,781
Could have just said, "Hello."

21
00:03:22,866 --> 00:03:24,825
What would be the fun in that?

22
00:03:24,951 --> 00:03:27,619
- How was the bishop?
- Not as good as you.

23
00:03:28,163 --> 00:03:29,539
You are incorrigible.

24
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:32,959
I bet you say that to all the girls.

25
00:03:36,172 --> 00:03:38,674
But, sir! Remember I am a lady!

26
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,884
Let me touch your bosom.

27
00:03:39,968 --> 00:03:41,635
Sir, keep your hands to yourself!

28
00:03:42,637 --> 00:03:45,347
Hallowed be thy name,
thy kingdom come,

29
00:03:45,515 --> 00:03:48,643
thy will be done, on earth
as it is in heaven.

30
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,520
Give us this day our daily bread,

31
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,481
and forgive us our trespasses,

32
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,150
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

33
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,193
Amen.

34
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:02,867
That's enough wine, I can assure...

35
00:04:18,385 --> 00:04:20,303
- What?
- Key.

36
00:04:28,897 --> 00:04:30,648
You mean this key?

37
00:04:40,284 --> 00:04:41,368
Who are you?

38
00:04:48,043 --> 00:04:50,753
- I'm not a priest.
- I'm not really a lady.

39
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:52,213
I have 1 0 minutes.

40
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:57,636
# There once was an aunt from Lorraine.

41
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,889
# With an incredible tolerance for pain.

42
00:05:00,932 --> 00:05:05,103
# She had a nasty habit
# Involving a chicken, a frog, and a rabbit

43
00:05:05,187 --> 00:05:08,064
I expected more
from a man of your reputation.

44
00:05:09,358 --> 00:05:13,194
I don't suppose you have any idea
where I could find Athos and Aramis?

45
00:05:15,532 --> 00:05:17,741
Never heard of them.

46
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:23,414
You French spies.
You're very, very arrogant. And foolish.

47
00:05:23,498 --> 00:05:24,624
And you're so...

48
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:26,084
Sexy?

49
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:28,795
It's a wonder it took me so long
to catch you.

50
00:05:29,255 --> 00:05:30,463
You didn't!

51
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:31,631
I beg your pardon?

52
00:05:33,259 --> 00:05:35,595
You didn't catch me.

53
00:05:36,305 --> 00:05:38,222
And what exactly are you doing here?

54
00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:39,974
Catching you.

55
00:06:01,957 --> 00:06:02,958
Key.

56
00:06:07,547 --> 00:06:08,797
Vive la France!

57
00:06:10,675 --> 00:06:12,302
Da Vinci's Vault.

58
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:16,806
Leonardo designed it to protect
the plans of his greatest inventions.

59
00:06:24,983 --> 00:06:25,983
Shall we?

60
00:06:31,783 --> 00:06:32,824
Now.

61
00:06:51,388 --> 00:06:54,306
Your part's done. Why don't you stay back?
We'll meet at the rally point.

62
00:06:55,016 --> 00:06:56,183
We came together,

63
00:06:57,352 --> 00:06:59,186
we leave together.

64
00:07:21,504 --> 00:07:22,504
I'll go.

65
00:07:22,547 --> 00:07:23,922
Wait, wait.

66
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,757
Too easy.

67
00:07:44,738 --> 00:07:46,739
- Pressure plates under the floor.
- Oh!

68
00:07:47,198 --> 00:07:49,576
- I could scale the walls.
- Run a cable along the roof.

69
00:07:49,618 --> 00:07:51,911
- Could be booby-trapped, too.
- Hmm.

70
00:08:18,859 --> 00:08:21,277
Well? We don't have all night.

71
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,949
You're absolutely certain
there are no hidden passages?

72
00:08:25,992 --> 00:08:27,117
And no secret tunnels?

73
00:08:27,202 --> 00:08:28,952
Positive, sir. It's a vault.

74
00:08:29,037 --> 00:08:30,496
One way in, one way out.

75
00:08:30,622 --> 00:08:34,792
Excellent! I want these Musketeers dead!
I want them dead!

76
00:08:34,834 --> 00:08:37,379
The guards change in two minutes,
maybe less.

77
00:08:38,381 --> 00:08:39,381
Less!

78
00:08:44,595 --> 00:08:45,638
What now?

79
00:08:45,722 --> 00:08:47,598
- C'est la vie?
- No.

80
00:08:48,683 --> 00:08:49,850
Contingency plan.

81
00:08:52,979 --> 00:08:54,314
Got it.

82
00:09:02,448 --> 00:09:04,659
Athos, you do know what's up there?

83
00:09:04,701 --> 00:09:06,452
Just hold your breath.

84
00:09:22,512 --> 00:09:23,680
Get out!

85
00:09:23,722 --> 00:09:26,391
Hey! Get back down there! Now!

86
00:09:38,822 --> 00:09:40,322
Go ahead, say it!

87
00:09:40,365 --> 00:09:41,365
I love you.

88
00:09:43,161 --> 00:09:46,746
I hate to ruin the mood,
but perhaps we could go elsewhere?

89
00:09:46,873 --> 00:09:49,875
You know, for once I think
the padre may be right.

90
00:09:56,258 --> 00:09:57,341
All for one.

91
00:09:57,718 --> 00:09:59,010
And one for all.

92
00:10:03,266 --> 00:10:04,391
So, what's next?

93
00:10:04,726 --> 00:10:06,143
Back to Paris, I guess.

94
00:10:06,352 --> 00:10:07,561
And then what?

95
00:10:07,729 --> 00:10:10,063
Wherever they send us,
whatever France needs.

96
00:10:10,106 --> 00:10:12,233
It's who we are. It's what we do.

97
00:10:14,528 --> 00:10:15,945
I do love you.

98
00:10:16,113 --> 00:10:17,197
I know.

99
00:10:17,531 --> 00:10:20,868
Then please try and understand
that this isn't personal.

100
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,037
It's strictly business.

101
00:10:24,706 --> 00:10:26,248
He made me a better offer.

102
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:36,927
Ah! Athos.

103
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:38,720
Buckingham.

104
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:49,399
A toxin.

105
00:10:52,278 --> 00:10:56,949
In case you were wondering, it wasn't
in your drink, it was on your cup.

106
00:10:57,075 --> 00:11:00,620
Inactive until it came into contact
with the liquid.

107
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,625
Don't worry.

108
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:08,629
Lt isn't fatal.

109
00:11:10,173 --> 00:11:13,008
Although I suspect
a part of you wishes it was.

110
00:11:14,261 --> 00:11:17,263
You take all the risk and I get the reward.

111
00:11:17,974 --> 00:11:19,808
Hardly seems fair.

112
00:11:20,851 --> 00:11:23,687
Well, just so you don't leave empty-handed,

113
00:11:23,813 --> 00:11:25,522
a word of advice.

114
00:11:30,112 --> 00:11:33,447
Trust no one, especially women.

115
00:11:35,367 --> 00:11:36,952
You'll live longer.

116
00:11:44,127 --> 00:11:48,131
Telling him you loved him
right before you betrayed him.

117
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:53,344
I must say, that was cruel,
even by my standards.

118
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:57,057
I only took away his prize.

119
00:11:57,392 --> 00:11:59,685
You took a lot more than that.

120
00:12:09,363 --> 00:12:12,741
At last, the war machine.

121
00:12:54,038 --> 00:12:55,246
Look down.

122
00:12:56,624 --> 00:12:59,417
It's a trick an old friend taught me.

123
00:13:00,294 --> 00:13:04,215
Your adversary will not always be
as noble as you.

124
00:13:04,883 --> 00:13:06,258
Remember that,

125
00:13:07,302 --> 00:13:09,261
and I have nothing left to teach you.

126
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:10,429
I doubt that, Father.

127
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,768
Keep it.

128
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:19,648
It's passed down from generation
to generation, from father to son.

129
00:13:19,774 --> 00:13:21,274
It's yours now.

130
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:27,990
The weapon of a Musketeer.

131
00:13:28,325 --> 00:13:30,451
The real weapon of a Musketeer

132
00:13:31,245 --> 00:13:32,496
is here.

133
00:13:33,164 --> 00:13:34,665
All for one.

134
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,458
And one for all.

135
00:13:37,252 --> 00:13:38,752
You remind me of somebody.

136
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,879
Let me guess. You.

137
00:13:41,382 --> 00:13:45,468
No, no.
The man I wish I was when I was your age.

138
00:13:47,304 --> 00:13:50,223
Well, you should really be on your way.

139
00:13:51,226 --> 00:13:55,646
Take this purse. There's 1 5 crowns in it.
It's enough to get you to Paris.

140
00:13:55,856 --> 00:14:00,151
And you'll need a mount.
Your mother's insisting you take Buttercup.

141
00:14:00,318 --> 00:14:03,155
- I know it's not much, and...
- It's plenty.

142
00:14:08,494 --> 00:14:11,873
Take care of yourself, my son.
Try not to get into any fights.

143
00:14:11,957 --> 00:14:16,335
If I'm to be a Musketeer, I think I might
have to do a little bit of fighting.

144
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,504
Stay at the back if you can.

145
00:14:18,672 --> 00:14:20,215
Yes, Mother.

146
00:14:20,675 --> 00:14:24,344
- There's one more piece of advice.
- I know, I know. Don't get into any trouble.

147
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:25,679
Wrong.

148
00:14:25,722 --> 00:14:27,222
Get into trouble.

149
00:14:27,849 --> 00:14:29,142
Make mistakes.

150
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:33,062
Fight, love, live.

151
00:14:35,065 --> 00:14:40,029
And remember, always,
you're a Gascon and our son.

152
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:45,075
Now go. Go.

153
00:15:23,077 --> 00:15:26,120
In the name of God,
what kind of beast is that?

154
00:15:26,623 --> 00:15:29,083
And the beast he's riding
doesn't look much either.

155
00:15:29,251 --> 00:15:30,543
- Ostler.
- Sir?

156
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,878
- Please see that my horse is watered and fed.
- Oh!

157
00:15:33,046 --> 00:15:34,797
It's a horse, is it?

158
00:15:35,173 --> 00:15:37,259
My friends here thought it was a cow.

159
00:15:39,971 --> 00:15:41,221
Excuse me.

160
00:15:42,431 --> 00:15:44,766
See, I know you men
are just kidding around.

161
00:15:45,393 --> 00:15:46,519
Buttercup,

162
00:15:47,521 --> 00:15:49,981
well, she gets a little sensitive.

163
00:15:51,441 --> 00:15:53,526
I'm afraid I must ask you to apologize.

164
00:15:54,528 --> 00:15:58,115
Well, I'm afraid I'm not in the habit
of apologizing to Gascon yokels.

165
00:15:58,616 --> 00:15:59,992
Not to me.

166
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:02,077
To my horse.

167
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,083
You've hurt her feelings.

168
00:16:10,462 --> 00:16:12,046
And if I don't?

169
00:16:12,673 --> 00:16:14,257
I shall have to kill you.

170
00:16:25,897 --> 00:16:27,105
You shot me!

171
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,649
Most observant of you, young man.

172
00:16:29,817 --> 00:16:32,652
But the real question is,
why are you not dead?

173
00:16:34,156 --> 00:16:35,615
Flesh wound.

174
00:16:35,991 --> 00:16:38,993
Sight must be off.
Who takes care of my pistols?

175
00:16:39,286 --> 00:16:40,786
Captain Rochefort, I...

176
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,834
Whoa, whoa, steady.

177
00:16:46,002 --> 00:16:47,961
Wouldn't want to dirty my blade
with peasant blood.

178
00:16:49,464 --> 00:16:50,672
So, boy,

179
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:52,634
consider this a lesson.

180
00:16:52,801 --> 00:16:53,801
Your last.

181
00:16:55,346 --> 00:16:56,346
No.

182
00:17:00,017 --> 00:17:02,478
He's too pretty for that.

183
00:17:04,105 --> 00:17:05,981
As you wish, Milady.

184
00:17:08,568 --> 00:17:09,860
Rochefort, come.

185
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,988
We're expected in Paris.

186
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,365
Thank you.

187
00:18:32,786 --> 00:18:34,203
Make way!

188
00:18:41,171 --> 00:18:42,796
I think you've had enough.

189
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:46,175
Where's my tankard?

190
00:18:47,343 --> 00:18:48,803
Excuse me!

191
00:18:51,474 --> 00:18:52,807
You think you're better than me?

192
00:18:52,975 --> 00:18:54,476
No.

193
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,061
Watch yourself, boy!

194
00:18:56,312 --> 00:18:58,064
All for one.

195
00:18:58,648 --> 00:19:00,107
Excuse me!

196
00:19:01,151 --> 00:19:03,069
- Sorry! I'm sorry!
- Are you blind?

197
00:19:03,236 --> 00:19:05,154
Look, I'm chasing after a man
who insulted my horse

198
00:19:05,238 --> 00:19:06,447
and tried to kill me, so let me go!

199
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:09,159
That's not good enough.
You spilled my drink and ruined my shirt.

200
00:19:09,368 --> 00:19:10,744
I'm in a hurry.

201
00:19:13,623 --> 00:19:15,832
- Here.
- 1 0 sous?

202
00:19:16,168 --> 00:19:19,295
- Who do you think you're talking to?
- The town drunk, from the smell of you.

203
00:19:19,421 --> 00:19:21,798
Now that, my boy, is fighting talk.

204
00:19:23,342 --> 00:19:25,928
- What are you saying exactly?
- Blind and deaf.

205
00:19:26,638 --> 00:19:28,305
Fortunately for you,
I'm somewhat of a doctor.

206
00:19:28,389 --> 00:19:30,182
Great! When can you fit me in?

207
00:19:30,892 --> 00:19:32,935
12:00, Cooper's Yard, St. Germain.

208
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:34,186
I'll be there.

209
00:19:37,191 --> 00:19:38,191
Excuse me!

210
00:19:38,275 --> 00:19:40,235
I just can't decide.

211
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:44,656
Well, if I might point out,
this does make you look very dignified,

212
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:48,035
whereas the blue one
brings out your dashing side.

213
00:19:48,161 --> 00:19:49,745
Equally important.

214
00:19:50,705 --> 00:19:53,249
Dignified. Dashing.

215
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:57,045
In the words of King
Solomon, I'll take both!

216
00:19:57,171 --> 00:19:59,172
A most excellent choice, sir.

217
00:20:01,884 --> 00:20:03,552
Darling, you spoil me.

218
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:05,888
I don't know how I shall ever repay you.

219
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,641
- Watch yourself!
- My apologies.

220
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:11,435
Matter of life and death. Won't happen
again. Believe you dropped this.

221
00:20:12,896 --> 00:20:13,897
This isn't mine.

222
00:20:13,982 --> 00:20:15,649
I saw the lady hand this to you,
I'm not blind.

223
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,610
Are you implying that
I take money from this woman?

224
00:20:18,736 --> 00:20:21,238
Are you saying that I cannot afford to pay
for my own wardrobe?

225
00:20:21,322 --> 00:20:23,783
Do you know who I am?

226
00:20:23,951 --> 00:20:24,993
No!

227
00:20:25,077 --> 00:20:26,411
Then we're even.

228
00:20:28,164 --> 00:20:30,248
You're in luck, boy.

229
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:34,420
Ordinarily, I would slaughter you on the
spot, but this is a brand-new jacket.

230
00:20:35,255 --> 00:20:37,798
Cooper's Yard, St. Germain, 1:00.

231
00:20:38,341 --> 00:20:40,342
I suggest you dress for a funeral!

232
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,844
What?

233
00:20:52,107 --> 00:20:54,525
- Lottery!
- There you go.

234
00:20:54,776 --> 00:20:57,028
Lottery ticket, sir?
Might be your lucky day!

235
00:21:03,494 --> 00:21:04,786
What the hell?

236
00:21:05,622 --> 00:21:06,955
5 francs?

237
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:09,082
Hey! Hey!

238
00:21:10,126 --> 00:21:11,336
What is this?

239
00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:13,296
It's a citation.

240
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:16,132
It's a ticket.

241
00:21:16,383 --> 00:21:19,302
Failure to remove animal bowel movements
from public area.

242
00:21:19,386 --> 00:21:20,471
French.

243
00:21:21,181 --> 00:21:23,891
Your horse took a dump on the street.

244
00:21:25,227 --> 00:21:26,310
You're joking.

245
00:21:27,229 --> 00:21:28,854
That's what they all say.

246
00:21:29,564 --> 00:21:30,815
You know what?

247
00:21:33,819 --> 00:21:36,571
Cooper's Yard, St. Germain, 2:00.

248
00:21:40,744 --> 00:21:41,994
Strange boy.

249
00:22:03,185 --> 00:22:04,185
Milady de Winter!

250
00:22:22,415 --> 00:22:23,957
Close game, Your Eminence.

251
00:22:24,417 --> 00:22:25,792
- Hmm.
- Who's the opponent?

252
00:22:25,876 --> 00:22:29,213
Myself. No one else proved to be
a sufficient challenge.

253
00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:37,055
Hmm.

254
00:22:37,348 --> 00:22:38,390
What news of England?

255
00:22:39,434 --> 00:22:40,892
He's coming.

256
00:22:41,686 --> 00:22:42,894
- Buckingham?
- Hmm.

257
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:44,896
And...

258
00:22:45,273 --> 00:22:46,273
And?

259
00:22:47,901 --> 00:22:49,277
He built it.

260
00:22:49,903 --> 00:22:51,195
The war machine.

261
00:22:51,363 --> 00:22:52,989
And he doesn't question your loyalty.

262
00:22:53,949 --> 00:22:56,201
He thinks he's so cunning.

263
00:22:56,911 --> 00:22:58,370
So evil.

264
00:22:58,705 --> 00:23:00,414
Evil is just a point of view.

265
00:23:01,624 --> 00:23:02,666
Ah!

266
00:23:02,751 --> 00:23:03,751
Richelieu.

267
00:23:09,425 --> 00:23:10,884
Is this lady the emissary from England?

268
00:23:11,052 --> 00:23:13,219
Your Majesty is exceptionally alert.

269
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:17,767
So, madam,

270
00:23:19,936 --> 00:23:21,020
what of Buckingham?

271
00:23:22,773 --> 00:23:23,773
Majesty?

272
00:23:23,857 --> 00:23:25,942
Well, what's he wearing these days?

273
00:23:27,945 --> 00:23:29,654
Green, Your Majesty.

274
00:23:30,948 --> 00:23:32,449
- Green?
- Hmm.

275
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,660
Very interesting.

276
00:23:34,828 --> 00:23:36,788
And you had the gall to recommend blue?

277
00:23:38,165 --> 00:23:39,290
Of course it should be green.

278
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:43,503
Why am I surrounded
by incompetent idiots?

279
00:23:45,131 --> 00:23:46,924
Green, green, green!

280
00:23:46,966 --> 00:23:49,259
Do I have to do everything myself?

281
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:01,564
Ah!

282
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:04,693
There you are. Shall we get to it?

283
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:07,488
So, are you eager
to meet your maker?

284
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:09,031
I have other appointments.

285
00:24:09,324 --> 00:24:10,741
You'll miss them, I'm afraid.

286
00:24:10,992 --> 00:24:13,203
Well, I'll try my best to be on time.

287
00:24:13,913 --> 00:24:15,038
My seconds.

288
00:24:15,206 --> 00:24:16,206
You!

289
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:18,041
You're fighting this rascal?

290
00:24:19,836 --> 00:24:21,503
My appointments.

291
00:24:22,004 --> 00:24:24,507
1:00. 2:00.

292
00:24:26,718 --> 00:24:28,052
How long have you been in Paris?

293
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,096
- Arrived this morning.
- You have been busy.

294
00:24:30,848 --> 00:24:33,350
Patience is not one of my virtues.

295
00:24:33,476 --> 00:24:34,643
Well, neither are good manners.

296
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:37,020
Wait for your turn, old man.

297
00:24:39,607 --> 00:24:42,777
What would you like me to put
on your headstone? "Little shit"?

298
00:24:43,612 --> 00:24:46,781
D'Artagnan.

299
00:24:48,075 --> 00:24:49,117
I'm Athos.

300
00:24:49,285 --> 00:24:50,869
This is Porthos and Aramis.

301
00:24:52,539 --> 00:24:55,249
The Three Musketeers.

302
00:24:55,709 --> 00:24:56,709
I've heard of you.

303
00:24:57,752 --> 00:25:01,381
From my father, a Musketeer himself.

304
00:25:01,549 --> 00:25:03,300
In fact, I came to Paris to be one of you.

305
00:25:03,384 --> 00:25:04,801
I'm afraid you're a little late.

306
00:25:05,553 --> 00:25:06,595
What happened?

307
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:08,889
Oh, a bad mission. Budget cuts.

308
00:25:09,432 --> 00:25:10,808
Cardinal, progress.

309
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:12,268
Take your pick.

310
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:16,439
Well, then, welcome to Paris.

311
00:25:16,607 --> 00:25:18,232
Pity we'll have to kill you.

312
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,947
Well, if I can't become a Musketeer,
I might as well fight one.

313
00:25:24,115 --> 00:25:25,491
Or three.

314
00:25:26,284 --> 00:25:29,496
Kill him already.
It's lunchtime and I'm starving.

315
00:25:40,217 --> 00:25:41,217
Halt!

316
00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:45,429
Jussac.

317
00:25:46,223 --> 00:25:50,227
Well, well, well.
How the mighty have fallen.

318
00:25:50,394 --> 00:25:52,395
Dueling in defiance of the edicts?

319
00:25:53,189 --> 00:25:55,690
You got tired of rolling peddlers
for spare change?

320
00:25:57,109 --> 00:25:58,945
- Now...
- Seal the square!

321
00:25:59,363 --> 00:26:02,907
Surrender your weapons
and come along with us.

322
00:26:03,033 --> 00:26:04,033
Seal it off!

323
00:26:04,243 --> 00:26:07,704
Unless, of course, you would rather resist.

324
00:26:07,872 --> 00:26:08,872
New plan.

325
00:26:09,332 --> 00:26:13,210
Kill the boy, kick their asses,
and then go get some lunch.

326
00:26:13,419 --> 00:26:15,003
I could do with some exercise.

327
00:26:22,263 --> 00:26:23,263
Seal it off, boys!

328
00:26:23,973 --> 00:26:25,014
You were saying?

329
00:26:25,766 --> 00:26:29,603
On the other hand,
discretion is the better part of valor.

330
00:26:29,771 --> 00:26:30,980
You're the Musketeers.

331
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:32,273
Wrong.

332
00:26:32,566 --> 00:26:36,068
We were the Musketeers.
Now we're just...us.

333
00:26:50,335 --> 00:26:51,669
Rochefort.

334
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,681
Shall we?

335
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,036
Finish them off.

336
00:28:03,708 --> 00:28:04,833
Let's even the odds.

337
00:29:09,656 --> 00:29:10,740
Enjoying the show?

338
00:29:11,241 --> 00:29:12,366
- You!
- Watch out!

339
00:29:30,012 --> 00:29:31,679
You didn't
answer my question.

340
00:29:31,847 --> 00:29:33,014
Are you always this cocky?

341
00:29:33,807 --> 00:29:34,807
Only on Tuesdays

342
00:29:39,189 --> 00:29:40,689
and whenever beautiful women are involved.

343
00:29:42,192 --> 00:29:43,192
Damn you!

344
00:29:47,071 --> 00:29:48,948
Can't you see
we're trying to have a conversation?

345
00:30:05,217 --> 00:30:06,885
What is your name?

346
00:30:08,262 --> 00:30:09,554
Constance.

347
00:30:10,348 --> 00:30:13,266
Constance. Sounds very steadfast.

348
00:30:13,893 --> 00:30:15,602
A quality you seem to know little about.

349
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:17,355
Oh, I beg to differ.

350
00:30:17,523 --> 00:30:20,233
Deep down, I am a hopeless romantic.

351
00:30:20,776 --> 00:30:22,235
Back for more?

352
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:36,793
Musketeers! Musketeers! Musketeers!

353
00:30:39,964 --> 00:30:42,090
I'd forgotten what it feels like.

354
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:44,050
We all have.

355
00:30:47,097 --> 00:30:48,806
The name is D'Artagnan.

356
00:30:50,225 --> 00:30:51,976
You must come from a very small town.

357
00:30:52,227 --> 00:30:53,269
How did you know?

358
00:30:53,436 --> 00:30:55,730
Lines like yours
might actually work there.

359
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:58,775
This is Paris.
I suggest you stick to swordplay.

360
00:30:59,485 --> 00:31:03,572
In the battle of wits,
you, sir, are unarmed.

361
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,746
She's right, lad.

362
00:31:10,914 --> 00:31:14,167
The ladies of Paris
are infinitely more complicated.

363
00:31:14,335 --> 00:31:17,504
They have 1,000 ways of saying, "No,"
and only some of them mean, "Yes."

364
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:19,423
I hate to ruin the mood,
but they will be back.

365
00:31:19,465 --> 00:31:22,426
And unless you wish to
fight an entire army.

366
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:26,306
Elsewhere.

367
00:31:30,644 --> 00:31:33,772
So, now what?
Do we pick up where we left off?

368
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,900
I think there's been enough fighting
for one day.

369
00:31:36,067 --> 00:31:39,486
Besides, any man who's an enemy
of Rochefort is a friend of mine.

370
00:31:39,613 --> 00:31:40,654
Who's Rochefort?

371
00:31:40,739 --> 00:31:42,991
Captain of the Cardinal's guards.

372
00:31:43,075 --> 00:31:45,452
The right hand of the most powerful man
in France.

373
00:31:45,494 --> 00:31:47,871
Rochefort is the most feared swordsman
in Europe.

374
00:31:48,331 --> 00:31:50,832
You certainly know how to pick your fights.

375
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,920
Like I said, he insulted my horse.

376
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:59,675
You're reckless,
arrogant, impetuous,

377
00:31:59,843 --> 00:32:02,846
probably be dead by sundown,
but I like you, lad.

378
00:32:04,849 --> 00:32:07,100
- Where are you staying?
- No idea.

379
00:32:07,268 --> 00:32:09,102
Ah! Do you have any money?

380
00:32:12,524 --> 00:32:13,691
Well, good sir,

381
00:32:13,859 --> 00:32:18,196
you and your fine steed
are welcome in our humble home.

382
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:20,824
For the time being.

383
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,286
That goes in there.

384
00:32:26,873 --> 00:32:28,207
Come on.

385
00:32:29,709 --> 00:32:31,336
What shall we drink to?

386
00:32:32,713 --> 00:32:33,797
How about the King?

387
00:32:33,881 --> 00:32:38,677
He's a child. Cardinal rules in all
but name, might as well drink to him.

388
00:32:40,305 --> 00:32:41,722
To France.

389
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:45,559
We served it, fought for it and bled for it.
Look where it got us.

390
00:32:45,686 --> 00:32:47,311
Friendship? Love?

391
00:32:47,938 --> 00:32:51,566
Word of advice, boy.
Trust no one.

392
00:32:53,569 --> 00:32:56,071
Must be something you still believe in.

393
00:32:56,781 --> 00:33:00,076
This.

394
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:02,578
And this.

395
00:33:05,541 --> 00:33:08,627
Anyone who tells you otherwise is either
a fool or trying to sell you something.

396
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:20,765
I know Athos may seem cold and unfriendly,
but don't let it fool you.

397
00:33:21,267 --> 00:33:24,602
- Deep down...
- He really is cold and unfriendly.

398
00:33:25,396 --> 00:33:26,730
What happened to him?

399
00:33:27,064 --> 00:33:30,109
What happens to any man, a woman.

400
00:33:31,653 --> 00:33:34,071
You know, I don't want to offend anybody,

401
00:33:35,824 --> 00:33:39,453
but I thought you'd all be
a little bit more...heroic.

402
00:33:43,458 --> 00:33:46,126
What my esteemed colleague
was trying to say, in his own way,

403
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:48,588
is that we are obsolete.

404
00:33:50,132 --> 00:33:52,842
We're warriors,
but there's no war for us to fight.

405
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:57,306
And so we drink and brawl
and quarrel with the Cardinal's guards

406
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:59,224
and then we drink some more.

407
00:34:00,643 --> 00:34:03,145
What we need is a great cause.

408
00:34:04,564 --> 00:34:06,649
But there are no great causes left.

409
00:34:06,734 --> 00:34:09,611
Which is why I keep telling you it's not
too late to do that priest thing again.

410
00:34:09,653 --> 00:34:10,862
Beats working for the city.

411
00:34:11,197 --> 00:34:14,157
Free booze at wakes and weddings.
And then there's the nuns.

412
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:15,868
You were a priest?

413
00:34:16,036 --> 00:34:18,079
Until I realized being a man of God

414
00:34:18,163 --> 00:34:20,498
and a man of the cloth
aren't always the same thing.

415
00:34:20,999 --> 00:34:23,918
And yet, he still says prayers
for those he kills.

416
00:34:24,002 --> 00:34:26,046
- Old habit.
- On the contrary.

417
00:34:26,506 --> 00:34:28,673
The men I kill deserve to die.

418
00:34:29,092 --> 00:34:31,176
But they also deserve peace.

419
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:33,553
After all, they must have believed
in something.

420
00:34:34,055 --> 00:34:36,849
We all do. Even the worst of us.

421
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:39,060
I'll drink to that!

422
00:34:40,687 --> 00:34:42,438
Planchet! More wine!

423
00:34:44,359 --> 00:34:45,692
Planchet!

424
00:34:46,194 --> 00:34:47,903
Sorry, sirs.

425
00:34:49,197 --> 00:34:50,197
I'm afraid

426
00:34:51,366 --> 00:34:53,283
there's none left. You've drunk the lot.

427
00:34:53,451 --> 00:34:54,702
What sort of answer's that?

428
00:34:55,412 --> 00:34:57,163
Well, go get some more, man!

429
00:34:57,331 --> 00:34:59,541
Very good, sir. It's just, I can't, sir.

430
00:35:01,502 --> 00:35:02,877
We've run out of money.

431
00:35:05,674 --> 00:35:07,383
Planchet, what are you?

432
00:35:07,759 --> 00:35:10,094
- Complete and utter waste of space, sir?
- And?

433
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,388
- As much use as a fart in a bottle, sir?
- Right.

434
00:35:12,597 --> 00:35:15,767
In short, sir, a total tit, sir.
But I can't work bleeding miracles!

435
00:35:16,686 --> 00:35:17,894
Planchet?

436
00:35:19,772 --> 00:35:20,897
Oh!

437
00:35:23,652 --> 00:35:24,986
Thank you very much, sir!

438
00:35:25,195 --> 00:35:29,073
That's incredibly generous
from such a handsome, young man.

439
00:35:29,116 --> 00:35:31,242
Thank you very, very much.

440
00:35:31,368 --> 00:35:33,453
Will you be staying here tonight?

441
00:35:33,621 --> 00:35:34,872
He'll be taking your bed, Planchet.

442
00:35:37,667 --> 00:35:39,376
Right, and so I'll be sleeping...

443
00:35:39,419 --> 00:35:40,919
You may take the balcony.

444
00:35:41,422 --> 00:35:43,381
Outside? The balcony outside in the cold?

445
00:35:43,549 --> 00:35:46,426
With birds shitting on my head all night?

446
00:35:46,802 --> 00:35:48,303
Great, can I just say you...

447
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,762
Wine! Wine!

448
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:53,100
- Wine! Wine! Wine! Wine!
- Yes! Of course! Wine it is, sirs!

449
00:36:15,667 --> 00:36:16,667
Check.

450
00:36:16,919 --> 00:36:19,337
This is a ridiculous game.

451
00:36:20,048 --> 00:36:22,049
Surely the King
should be the most powerful piece?

452
00:36:22,258 --> 00:36:24,885
The King is the most important piece.

453
00:36:24,969 --> 00:36:27,387
But he's vulnerable, he needs protection.

454
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:29,682
May I suggest you castle him?

455
00:36:37,483 --> 00:36:38,984
Checkmate.

456
00:36:43,907 --> 00:36:46,200
There. What do you think of that?

457
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,829
Your Majesty is a force of nature.

458
00:36:50,498 --> 00:36:53,750
- Took you by surprise, eh?
- Yes, indeed, you did.

459
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:58,339
May we speak a little about foreign policy?

460
00:36:58,757 --> 00:37:01,968
- It's not about Buckingham, is it?
- Oh, I'm afraid it is.

461
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:04,929
He's arriving in Paris tomorrow.

462
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:09,309
His master, King James, has agreed
to hear our peace proposal.

463
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:13,981
Good, good. Well, he knows better
than to mess with me, then.

464
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,440
There's also another matter.

465
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,569
A dangerous rivalry has sprung

466
00:37:18,696 --> 00:37:21,239
between Your Majesty's Musketeers
and my personal guards.

467
00:37:21,699 --> 00:37:22,907
Who was involved?

468
00:37:23,367 --> 00:37:26,244
Athos, Porthos, Aramis.

469
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:28,872
The usual suspects.

470
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,458
And a young man called D'Artagnan.

471
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:37,048
I have summoned them to the palace so that
Your Majesty can punish them severely.

472
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,114
His Majesty, the King!

473
00:37:59,824 --> 00:38:01,408
Well, well, well.

474
00:38:04,454 --> 00:38:06,456
Brawling with the Cardinal's guards.

475
00:38:06,957 --> 00:38:08,458
That's very bad.

476
00:38:08,917 --> 00:38:10,585
What have you got to say for yourselves?

477
00:38:10,919 --> 00:38:14,213
- We...
- Humbly beg your pardon, Your Majesty.

478
00:38:14,381 --> 00:38:16,759
Yes.
Yes, I should hope so, too.

479
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:20,137
So, tell me, how many
were involved in the altercation?

480
00:38:20,722 --> 00:38:23,932
There were four of us against 40 of them,
Your Majesty.

481
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,602
Four against 40?

482
00:38:28,689 --> 00:38:30,607
And you beat them like a drum?

483
00:38:30,858 --> 00:38:33,819
And, yes, you shall have to be reprimanded,
of course,

484
00:38:33,904 --> 00:38:35,654
most harshly, I'm afraid.

485
00:38:36,031 --> 00:38:38,282
- You do understand that, don't you?
- We do, Your Majesty.

486
00:38:38,367 --> 00:38:39,450
Her Majesty, the Queen.

487
00:38:47,335 --> 00:38:48,418
Anne.

488
00:38:49,253 --> 00:38:50,879
What a... What a pleasant surprise!

489
00:38:51,798 --> 00:38:54,300
My ladies and I wanted to see
the valiant Musketeers

490
00:38:54,385 --> 00:38:56,094
who stood against the Cardinal's guards.

491
00:38:56,762 --> 00:38:58,805
Four against 40?

492
00:38:58,847 --> 00:39:00,056
Or was it 400?

493
00:39:01,475 --> 00:39:03,060
Just 40, Your Majesty.

494
00:39:03,311 --> 00:39:04,686
Lt was an off day.

495
00:39:05,897 --> 00:39:07,398
That's my Musketeers for you.

496
00:39:07,482 --> 00:39:10,234
By the time they write songs about them,
it'll be 4,000.

497
00:39:10,318 --> 00:39:11,819
I hope you won't be too harsh with them.

498
00:39:13,072 --> 00:39:15,115
After all, boys will be boys.

499
00:39:20,996 --> 00:39:22,164
You must be D'Artagnan.

500
00:39:23,291 --> 00:39:27,503
My lady in waiting has told me about
how brave and dashing you were yesterday.

501
00:39:28,171 --> 00:39:30,381
But you must try not to be so reckless.

502
00:39:30,465 --> 00:39:31,842
Can't help myself, Your Majesty.

503
00:39:32,593 --> 00:39:34,344
- Your Majesty, the culprits.
- Ah! Yes, yes.

504
00:39:36,889 --> 00:39:37,973
Well, stand up, then.

505
00:39:45,274 --> 00:39:46,274
Athos.

506
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:48,359
Porthos.

507
00:39:49,027 --> 00:39:50,362
Aramis.

508
00:39:52,949 --> 00:39:57,870
Forgive me for saying this, D'Artagnan,
but you do look a little underdressed.

509
00:39:59,122 --> 00:40:01,458
My father is a poor man, Your Majesty.

510
00:40:02,042 --> 00:40:04,252
A former Musketeer as well.

511
00:40:04,712 --> 00:40:07,088
These are the only clothes I have.

512
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:10,217
Oh, Lord.
We shall have to rectify that.

513
00:40:10,635 --> 00:40:14,722
Can't have my Musketeers,
or the son of one, looking like tramps.

514
00:40:15,974 --> 00:40:18,517
New suits all around, I think.

515
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:21,980
Yes. You'll see to that, Cardinal?

516
00:40:22,231 --> 00:40:26,693
And, yes, I think a purse of gold for each
as a reward for your courage.

517
00:40:26,777 --> 00:40:28,320
You'll see to that as well, Cardinal.

518
00:40:28,489 --> 00:40:30,323
And, yes, before I forget,

519
00:40:30,407 --> 00:40:33,201
no more fighting
with His Eminence's guards.

520
00:40:33,577 --> 00:40:34,660
Hmm?

521
00:40:37,706 --> 00:40:39,416
Or there'll be none of them left.

522
00:40:41,961 --> 00:40:43,921
Your Majesty, might I suggest a more...

523
00:40:44,005 --> 00:40:45,923
Forgive my impudence, Cardinal,

524
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:48,468
but I doubt the King
requires your advice in this matter.

525
00:40:48,552 --> 00:40:50,720
After all, they are his Musketeers.

526
00:40:51,263 --> 00:40:52,263
Good day, gentlemen.

527
00:40:58,772 --> 00:41:00,648
Well, now,
off with you rascals.

528
00:41:01,274 --> 00:41:06,070
But be there for the parade tomorrow.
New suits and all.

529
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:09,991
I tire of these royal children.

530
00:41:10,952 --> 00:41:13,286
It's time to make our move.

531
00:41:13,913 --> 00:41:17,250
We shall use Buckingham's arrival
to our advantage.

532
00:41:17,417 --> 00:41:19,335
During his visit, we will reveal

533
00:41:19,503 --> 00:41:22,880
that he arranged a secret rendezvous
with the Queen.

534
00:41:23,048 --> 00:41:26,468
May I inquire how Your Eminence
has uncovered this scandalous affair?

535
00:41:26,553 --> 00:41:31,181
By reading Buckingham's letters
to the Queen, found in her possession.

536
00:41:31,349 --> 00:41:34,268
Written in Buckingham's hand,
then authenticated by his seal?

537
00:41:34,811 --> 00:41:38,147
A woman of your talents
should have no trouble procuring either.

538
00:41:38,566 --> 00:41:40,817
Hmm. Your Eminence is too kind.

539
00:41:40,901 --> 00:41:43,152
However, I doubt that the King
will accept such letters

540
00:41:43,237 --> 00:41:46,699
as definitive proof of
his wife's indiscretion.

541
00:41:47,701 --> 00:41:51,120
Then we shall provide him
with something a bit more substantial.

542
00:41:51,288 --> 00:41:55,959
A piece of the Queen's jewelry given
to Buckingham as a token of affection.

543
00:41:56,002 --> 00:41:58,169
Buckingham will be humiliated.

544
00:41:58,421 --> 00:41:59,713
The King will be outraged.

545
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:02,340
The Queen will be executed.

546
00:42:02,758 --> 00:42:05,761
France will have no
choice but to go to war.

547
00:42:06,597 --> 00:42:11,142
And in times like these, France will
naturally turn to a stronger leader.

548
00:42:12,352 --> 00:42:17,399
Someone better equipped to rule a nation
than a cuckolded teenager with a grudge.

549
00:42:18,192 --> 00:42:19,234
Hmm.

550
00:42:21,571 --> 00:42:23,990
Someone like Your Eminence.

551
00:42:35,545 --> 00:42:38,213
About face!

552
00:42:55,108 --> 00:42:58,736
Well, where is he, then?
It's just appalling manners.

553
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,722
Drop anchor!

554
00:43:24,099 --> 00:43:25,182
Anchor aweigh!

555
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,450
Damn his impudence!

556
00:43:42,577 --> 00:43:45,287
What is that thing called
anyway, Richelieu?

557
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,957
An airship, Your Majesty.

558
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:57,884
- Why don't I have one of those?
- An oversight on our part.

559
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:01,222
Right, right. Well, build me one.

560
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,156
Secure the lines!

561
00:44:17,615 --> 00:44:19,075
All lines secured!

562
00:44:36,803 --> 00:44:38,054
Buckingham.

563
00:44:40,516 --> 00:44:41,600
Blue.

564
00:44:43,019 --> 00:44:44,102
Oh.

565
00:44:49,109 --> 00:44:50,735
Your Majesty.

566
00:44:52,154 --> 00:44:53,362
Love the outfit.

567
00:44:53,697 --> 00:44:55,114
Very retro.

568
00:44:55,282 --> 00:44:56,617
We were all wearing those in London,

569
00:44:57,202 --> 00:45:00,954
when was it, last year or the year before?

570
00:45:02,373 --> 00:45:06,127
Lord Buckingham, I trust your journey
wasn't too uncomfortable.

571
00:45:06,212 --> 00:45:08,046
Not at all. No.

572
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:09,380
On the contrary.

573
00:45:09,548 --> 00:45:13,426
Handles like a dream and keeps me
one step closer to heaven.

574
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:15,721
Cardinal.

575
00:45:20,393 --> 00:45:25,065
Of course, being a servant of God,
you have no need for such crude devices.

576
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,402
King James is most eager
to hear your peace proposal.

577
00:45:29,487 --> 00:45:31,238
- Lord Buckingham.
- Anne.

578
00:45:31,823 --> 00:45:32,823
Your Majesty.

579
00:45:33,491 --> 00:45:37,411
I must say your beauty is far more radiant
than I remember.

580
00:45:37,496 --> 00:45:39,038
You've met before?

581
00:45:39,206 --> 00:45:40,623
A long time ago.

582
00:45:40,707 --> 00:45:43,668
An evening I shall cherish forever.

583
00:45:45,505 --> 00:45:47,256
Right. Well, shall we?

584
00:45:52,095 --> 00:45:54,013
Now this is a pleasant surprise.

585
00:45:55,099 --> 00:45:56,891
Another acquaintance of yours, I see.

586
00:45:57,309 --> 00:45:58,768
We've met, yes.

587
00:45:58,936 --> 00:46:02,856
As I recall, last I saw you,
you were on your knees as well.

588
00:46:03,483 --> 00:46:05,651
Most unfortunate habit.

589
00:46:05,861 --> 00:46:08,445
It's a habit I shall have to break
during our next encounter.

590
00:46:10,073 --> 00:46:11,949
I look forward to it.

591
00:46:12,743 --> 00:46:15,120
In the meantime, shall we talk peace?

592
00:46:20,835 --> 00:46:24,005
You must pass me the name
of your interior decorator.

593
00:46:24,673 --> 00:46:25,673
Wine?

594
00:46:26,133 --> 00:46:27,300
I don't drink.

595
00:46:27,885 --> 00:46:31,095
What about that rather nice bottle of
Bordeaux in your middle left-hand drawer?

596
00:46:32,181 --> 00:46:34,933
You must pass me the name
of your spy in the palace.

597
00:46:35,768 --> 00:46:37,436
And yours in mine.

598
00:46:40,148 --> 00:46:42,775
England cannot afford a war on two fronts.

599
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:45,486
Both our nations
are stretched to breaking point.

600
00:46:45,571 --> 00:46:49,657
A peace treaty would be
of immense strategic advantage.

601
00:46:49,825 --> 00:46:52,119
Whose advantage? Yours?

602
00:46:52,203 --> 00:46:53,203
Ours.

603
00:46:54,289 --> 00:46:59,335
I have a feeling my new war machines
will readdress the balance.

604
00:47:01,881 --> 00:47:03,506
Very impressive.

605
00:47:04,675 --> 00:47:09,596
And march!
Left, left, left, right, left!

606
00:47:13,143 --> 00:47:14,727
Hold your line!

607
00:47:14,978 --> 00:47:15,978
Halt!

608
00:47:16,063 --> 00:47:17,855
About face!

609
00:47:20,068 --> 00:47:21,193
Stay where you are!

610
00:47:21,277 --> 00:47:23,362
This is the Queen's wing.
You can't be up here.

611
00:47:23,529 --> 00:47:24,780
Oh, thank goodness.

612
00:47:24,948 --> 00:47:29,242
I got so lost. I took a wrong turn
and then a door slammed behind me.

613
00:47:29,495 --> 00:47:33,790
I've been trapped up here, in the sun,
in this heat.

614
00:47:34,041 --> 00:47:36,125
- It's going to be all right.
- Oh, I'm gonna faint.

615
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:38,503
- You're in safe hands.
- Thank you.

616
00:47:38,754 --> 00:47:40,047
And march!

617
00:48:02,114 --> 00:48:03,114
Halt!

618
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:06,325
You can't shoot. They'll hear you.

619
00:48:06,576 --> 00:48:07,703
Shh!

620
00:48:08,454 --> 00:48:09,746
Wait for it!

621
00:48:19,425 --> 00:48:21,092
Left, left!

622
00:48:23,095 --> 00:48:26,180
Constance! Constance!
Hey, hey, excuse me!

623
00:48:26,933 --> 00:48:28,851
Pardon, Your Majesty.

624
00:48:29,019 --> 00:48:30,853
This will only take a moment.

625
00:48:33,106 --> 00:48:34,773
What are you doing here?

626
00:48:34,941 --> 00:48:37,819
His Majesty wants a word with me.
Imagine that.

627
00:48:37,987 --> 00:48:40,321
Yes, lovely. Now, excuse me.

628
00:48:40,489 --> 00:48:41,573
I was...

629
00:48:41,741 --> 00:48:46,162
I was thinking, after I'm finished
with His Majesty, maybe we could talk?

630
00:48:46,246 --> 00:48:47,997
I can't. I have plans.

631
00:48:48,081 --> 00:48:49,081
What about tomorrow?

632
00:48:49,207 --> 00:48:50,207
I have a lot of plans.

633
00:48:50,333 --> 00:48:51,917
- Well, I...
- Look, D'Artagnan.

634
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,962
You may have a new set of clothes
and the King's favor,

635
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:57,340
but you still act like
a clumsy country boy.

636
00:48:57,550 --> 00:48:59,092
Now excuse me.

637
00:49:16,154 --> 00:49:17,488
And halt!

638
00:49:18,615 --> 00:49:20,282
About face!

639
00:49:21,367 --> 00:49:23,035
And march!

640
00:49:24,246 --> 00:49:26,539
Left! Left, right, left!

641
00:49:30,377 --> 00:49:34,006
Two summons in two days.
Your Majesty honors me.

642
00:49:34,049 --> 00:49:37,051
Cut it out.
Please, think nothing of it.

643
00:49:37,469 --> 00:49:40,012
You're a good fellow, D'Artagnan.

644
00:49:40,097 --> 00:49:43,850
So, how are the ladies
treating you these days?

645
00:49:44,727 --> 00:49:46,812
- Can't complain.
- Yes, indeed.

646
00:49:46,979 --> 00:49:49,147
Well, same here, of course. Thing is...

647
00:49:52,068 --> 00:49:54,779
I've got this friend.

648
00:49:55,739 --> 00:49:57,573
Just a regular chap, like you and me.

649
00:49:57,950 --> 00:49:59,659
He got married very young.

650
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,205
Political alliance, arranged marriage,
you know the sort of thing.

651
00:50:03,373 --> 00:50:04,498
Hardly knew the girl.

652
00:50:04,666 --> 00:50:07,584
- But he likes her?
- Oh, yes.

653
00:50:07,752 --> 00:50:08,794
Mmm-hmm.

654
00:50:08,878 --> 00:50:09,878
Very much.

655
00:50:10,296 --> 00:50:12,006
Well, does she like him?

656
00:50:12,174 --> 00:50:15,844
Well, funny you should say that.
That's the problem.

657
00:50:16,053 --> 00:50:18,096
He's... He's not sure.

658
00:50:20,015 --> 00:50:22,434
Well, he just feels like a fool
when he's around her.

659
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:26,063
He's always saying the wrong thing.
His palms are sweating.

660
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:30,025
His heart's pumping so loud
he's afraid she might hear it.

661
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,820
It's torture just to look at her.

662
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:35,657
- Have you ever felt this way?
- Not until recently.

663
00:50:37,577 --> 00:50:41,622
So, what do we do?
I mean, my friend. What does he do?

664
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,960
He should speak his heart.

665
00:50:46,712 --> 00:50:50,006
Be someone who cares for her
and isn't afraid to show it.

666
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:54,136
Be himself.

667
00:50:54,554 --> 00:50:56,305
Well, that's what I told him.

668
00:50:56,431 --> 00:50:58,223
Well, then he's doubly lucky.

669
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:01,102
After all, he does have
Your Majesty as a friend.

670
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:05,023
Yes. Yes. It's good to have friends.

671
00:51:08,485 --> 00:51:10,446
Will you excuse me just for one moment?

672
00:51:11,364 --> 00:51:12,781
I don't believe it.

673
00:51:19,957 --> 00:51:20,999
How are you?

674
00:51:21,667 --> 00:51:22,918
Very well.

675
00:51:25,504 --> 00:51:26,963
I'm wearing blue.

676
00:51:27,798 --> 00:51:29,133
And you look very handsome in it.

677
00:51:30,636 --> 00:51:35,223
Thank you. Yes, I...
You're looking just very lovely.

678
00:51:35,307 --> 00:51:39,228
In fact, I was only just remarking
to D'Artagnan how...

679
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:42,689
How beautiful you are.

680
00:51:44,609 --> 00:51:45,692
Thank you, My Lord.

681
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:21,882
- How did it go?
- Clockwork.

682
00:53:22,342 --> 00:53:23,426
Good.

683
00:53:24,178 --> 00:53:27,680
You'll go back to London
with Buckingham and the diamonds.

684
00:53:27,848 --> 00:53:29,474
And what should I do with them?

685
00:53:29,641 --> 00:53:33,395
Put them in his personal vault,
the most secure location in all of England.

686
00:53:33,563 --> 00:53:35,439
- The Tower of London.
- Yup.

687
00:53:36,566 --> 00:53:39,610
When the scandal breaks,
he'll deny everything.

688
00:53:39,944 --> 00:53:42,279
But once the diamonds
are discovered in his possession...

689
00:53:42,531 --> 00:53:45,158
He would have led England to war
through his indiscretion.

690
00:53:46,911 --> 00:53:50,038
And what of the future of France?

691
00:53:52,417 --> 00:53:53,793
I am France.

692
00:54:03,471 --> 00:54:05,138
One last thing.

693
00:54:08,142 --> 00:54:11,312
I suppose it's quite easy,
perhaps even tempting,

694
00:54:11,355 --> 00:54:14,482
for a double agent to play both sides.

695
00:54:15,692 --> 00:54:18,945
Have I given Your Eminence
any reason to doubt my loyalty?

696
00:54:18,987 --> 00:54:20,614
Spare me the rhetoric.

697
00:54:21,908 --> 00:54:24,701
I know who you are. I know what you are.

698
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:29,748
You have a gift for corruption
and a penchant for betrayal.

699
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:31,668
I admire such skills.

700
00:54:32,545 --> 00:54:35,088
But I'll destroy you the moment I suspect

701
00:54:35,339 --> 00:54:37,590
you might be using them against me.

702
00:54:39,468 --> 00:54:41,470
Do we understand one another?

703
00:54:43,723 --> 00:54:44,849
There

704
00:54:46,017 --> 00:54:48,227
is another side to that coin.

705
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:53,066
It's quite easy for an employer
to sever all ties with his operative,

706
00:54:53,776 --> 00:54:57,028
in the event that they are compromised,
leaving them to

707
00:54:57,071 --> 00:55:00,116
rot in jail or on the gallows.

708
00:55:02,411 --> 00:55:04,120
Your point being?

709
00:55:05,789 --> 00:55:09,334
I require a guarantee
that I shall not suffer a similar fate.

710
00:55:11,212 --> 00:55:13,714
An insurance policy, if you will.

711
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:16,800
My word should suffice.

712
00:55:17,969 --> 00:55:20,847
I'm afraid I'll need something a bit more

713
00:55:22,349 --> 00:55:23,725
substantial.

714
00:55:26,562 --> 00:55:30,149
"It is by my order
and for the good of the State

715
00:55:30,233 --> 00:55:34,320
"that the bearer of this
has done what has been done."

716
00:55:34,905 --> 00:55:36,280
Satisfied?

717
00:55:36,698 --> 00:55:37,782
Immensely.

718
00:55:44,207 --> 00:55:45,540
Your Majesty.

719
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,001
Purple?

720
00:55:49,254 --> 00:55:51,464
Fashion favors the bold.

721
00:55:52,841 --> 00:55:53,841
Here.

722
00:55:54,134 --> 00:55:55,760
Try this for size.

723
00:55:57,305 --> 00:55:58,305
Oh, well.

724
00:55:58,515 --> 00:56:00,098
Do give my regards to the Queen.

725
00:56:00,558 --> 00:56:04,478
I will convey your diplomatic proposal
to King James immediately.

726
00:56:04,646 --> 00:56:07,482
Cardinal Richelieu, a pleasure.

727
00:56:08,192 --> 00:56:09,442
All mine.

728
00:56:15,575 --> 00:56:16,992
Your Eminence.

729
00:56:36,765 --> 00:56:37,765
Richelieu!

730
00:56:37,808 --> 00:56:38,933
Richelieu!

731
00:56:39,768 --> 00:56:41,852
There has been
the most distressing development.

732
00:56:41,979 --> 00:56:43,312
Certain letters,

733
00:56:43,355 --> 00:56:46,400
love letters, were discovered
in the Queen's possession.

734
00:56:46,484 --> 00:56:47,734
Letters from him.

735
00:56:48,152 --> 00:56:50,404
Buckingham, of course! Who else?

736
00:56:50,488 --> 00:56:52,573
Have you spoken to the Queen
about these letters?

737
00:56:52,782 --> 00:56:55,994
No. Of course I haven't.
She'll just deny the whole thing!

738
00:56:56,328 --> 00:56:57,370
Hmm.

739
00:56:57,454 --> 00:57:00,164
I can see Your Majesty's dilemma.

740
00:57:01,083 --> 00:57:04,420
Is there any mention
of a specific encounter? A detail?

741
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:07,923
- A token of affection, perhaps?
- Yes.

742
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,466
Yes, there is.

743
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:13,722
A necklace. The one I gave her
for our anniversary. Here.

744
00:57:13,889 --> 00:57:17,601
"I shall always cherish
the 1 2 studded diamonds you gave me,

745
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:20,437
"the proof of our consummated love."

746
00:57:21,439 --> 00:57:24,525
Does "consummated" mean
what I think it means?

747
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:26,444
Yes, I'm afraid it does.

748
00:57:28,363 --> 00:57:29,739
Oh, my God!

749
00:57:30,741 --> 00:57:33,410
All Your Majesty has to do is throw a ball.

750
00:57:34,329 --> 00:57:36,038
What? How would that help?

751
00:57:36,205 --> 00:57:39,625
Lt would give Your Majesty the pretext
to suggest to the Queen

752
00:57:39,709 --> 00:57:40,917
that she wear your gift.

753
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:46,049
Oh, Richelieu, that's very clever.
That's very clever.

754
00:57:47,009 --> 00:57:48,676
So, if she has the diamonds...

755
00:57:48,927 --> 00:57:50,553
Your Majesty can rest easy.

756
00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:53,807
And if she doesn't?

757
00:57:55,226 --> 00:57:58,228
He wants to have a celebration ball,
five days from now.

758
00:57:58,647 --> 00:58:01,066
Send my diamonds to the jeweler's
to be polished.

759
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:04,110
I want the King's undivided attention
that evening.

760
00:58:24,384 --> 00:58:25,592
I hope I am not interrupting.

761
00:58:25,802 --> 00:58:28,512
Hardly, Your Majesty. To what do I owe...

762
00:58:28,596 --> 00:58:29,597
I know.

763
00:58:30,724 --> 00:58:33,476
Perhaps Your Majesty
would care to be a bit more specific?

764
00:58:34,103 --> 00:58:35,311
I know.

765
00:58:35,979 --> 00:58:37,021
Yeah.

766
00:58:37,106 --> 00:58:39,983
I assume this is the part
where I'm supposed to laugh maniacally

767
00:58:40,068 --> 00:58:44,071
and regale Your Majesty with the details
of some diabolical plot.

768
00:58:44,656 --> 00:58:47,282
However, I regret to inform Your Majesty

769
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:49,994
that I have no idea of
what you're talking about.

770
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:51,705
I thought you'd say that.

771
00:58:51,956 --> 00:58:55,333
Then why did you grace me
with the honor of your visit?

772
00:58:55,793 --> 00:58:57,460
To look into your eyes when you said it.

773
00:59:07,013 --> 00:59:08,432
Your Majesty.

774
00:59:11,978 --> 00:59:13,812
All may not be lost yet.

775
00:59:19,486 --> 00:59:21,195
Coming, coming!
Hold your horses!

776
00:59:21,739 --> 00:59:23,740
It's not a matter of
life or death, you know?

777
00:59:23,824 --> 00:59:25,658
Actually, it is.

778
00:59:25,993 --> 00:59:27,661
You want me to go to England,

779
00:59:27,746 --> 00:59:29,496
retrieve the diamonds,
which the Queen suspects

780
00:59:29,539 --> 00:59:31,498
might be in Buckingham's possession,

781
00:59:31,791 --> 00:59:33,917
which will naturally involve breaking into
some heavily fortified,

782
00:59:34,169 --> 00:59:36,253
highly impregnable facility?

783
00:59:36,338 --> 00:59:37,464
The Tower of London.

784
00:59:37,548 --> 00:59:40,425
Since the Cardinal's spies
are trying to implicate the Duke,

785
00:59:40,509 --> 00:59:41,801
it is the most logical choice.

786
00:59:42,636 --> 00:59:46,348
Then return to Paris
with every soldier, assassin,

787
00:59:46,683 --> 00:59:49,393
mercenary, bounty hunter,

788
00:59:49,770 --> 00:59:53,230
on both sides of the Channel
out to stop me from doing so.

789
00:59:53,607 --> 00:59:55,024
Did I miss anything?

790
00:59:55,526 --> 00:59:56,693
All in five days.

791
00:59:56,861 --> 00:59:58,987
A minor detail. Anything else?

792
00:59:59,197 --> 01:00:00,197
No.

793
01:00:01,532 --> 01:00:03,283
Well, I really only have
one question for you.

794
01:00:04,327 --> 01:00:06,329
Why in the world would I do that?

795
01:00:14,714 --> 01:00:16,131
England it is.

796
01:00:19,385 --> 01:00:21,386
Diamonds, Buckingham,
Tower of London, five days,

797
01:00:21,429 --> 01:00:23,847
Queen's reputation
and the fate of France as we know it.

798
01:00:24,725 --> 01:00:25,934
Who's with me?

799
01:00:30,815 --> 01:00:33,818
Well, I should imagine
the Queen would be quite generous.

800
01:00:34,194 --> 01:00:38,906
Count Porthos. Hmm? What do you think?
Got a nice ring to it, doesn't it?

801
01:00:39,241 --> 01:00:43,537
Besides, I hear the English women are a
lot like a frosted bottle of champagne.

802
01:00:43,663 --> 01:00:46,373
Ice on the outside,
but once you warm them up...

803
01:00:47,124 --> 01:00:51,169
This isn't a great cause,
but it'll have to do.

804
01:00:56,593 --> 01:00:58,636
Buckingham's there, so is she.

805
01:00:59,096 --> 01:01:00,096
Who?

806
01:01:00,764 --> 01:01:02,098
Countess de Winter.

807
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:03,725
Charlotte Backson.

808
01:01:03,977 --> 01:01:06,353
Anne de Breuil. Lady Clarick.

809
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:08,605
Milady.

810
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:10,274
Milady?

811
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:13,820
I know her. I saw her with Rochefort.

812
01:01:14,321 --> 01:01:15,738
She's switched sides again.

813
01:01:15,906 --> 01:01:17,782
She's working for the Cardinal, no doubt.

814
01:01:17,867 --> 01:01:19,325
What are you going to do if you catch her?

815
01:01:21,245 --> 01:01:24,623
Musketeers, open up
and surrender by order of the Cardinal!

816
01:01:24,916 --> 01:01:26,792
- You were followed.
- It's Rochefort.

817
01:01:27,502 --> 01:01:31,965
Athos, Porthos, Aramis and D'Artagnan,

818
01:01:32,008 --> 01:01:35,343
surrender your weapons
and no harm will come to you.

819
01:01:37,305 --> 01:01:39,097
The moment they step out,

820
01:01:39,932 --> 01:01:41,183
kill them.

821
01:01:43,353 --> 01:01:44,812
Light the torches!

822
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:47,607
I'll count to five, then
we'll burn you out!

823
01:01:53,323 --> 01:01:54,406
One!

824
01:01:54,949 --> 01:01:55,949
Two!

825
01:01:56,326 --> 01:01:57,492
Three!

826
01:01:58,036 --> 01:01:59,578
Oh! Sorry! Didn't see you there.

827
01:01:59,662 --> 01:02:00,872
Damn you!

828
01:02:05,044 --> 01:02:06,169
Fire!

829
01:02:20,811 --> 01:02:22,562
Let me guess.

830
01:02:22,647 --> 01:02:24,940
You've come to tell me
that the Musketeers are dead,

831
01:02:25,024 --> 01:02:27,776
our plan is proceeding on schedule,

832
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:30,738
and I have absolutely, positively,
nothing to worry about.

833
01:02:31,657 --> 01:02:34,033
We were taken by surprise, Your Eminence.

834
01:02:34,201 --> 01:02:36,744
Somehow I was laboring
under the assumption

835
01:02:36,828 --> 01:02:39,790
that the plan was for you
to take them by surprise.

836
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:43,460
- Was it not?
- Eminence...

837
01:02:43,628 --> 01:02:45,212
Yes, you are quite fond of that word,
aren't you?

838
01:02:45,338 --> 01:02:48,299
Sadly, repeating it
doesn't get you into my good graces.

839
01:02:49,093 --> 01:02:50,927
Alert Milady. Watch the ports.

840
01:02:51,095 --> 01:02:53,805
No one is to leave for England
without my official permission.

841
01:02:54,223 --> 01:02:55,890
Post a bounty on their heads.

842
01:02:56,058 --> 01:02:57,810
The bigger, the better.

843
01:02:58,061 --> 01:02:59,728
Yes, Your Eminence.

844
01:03:00,188 --> 01:03:01,271
Rochefort.

845
01:03:04,567 --> 01:03:06,527
Do not fail me again.

846
01:03:17,290 --> 01:03:20,710
Jussac and a lot of help.
There's no way past.

847
01:03:21,294 --> 01:03:22,753
How the hell did he get here so fast?

848
01:03:27,218 --> 01:03:28,927
- Now what?
- We need a distraction.

849
01:03:29,178 --> 01:03:30,554
- I'll go.
- I'll go.

850
01:03:30,596 --> 01:03:31,888
I could go.

851
01:03:32,598 --> 01:03:33,598
Probably not.

852
01:03:33,725 --> 01:03:34,725
Wrong.

853
01:03:34,767 --> 01:03:37,603
Wrong on all counts.
You'll need every sword where you're going.

854
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:40,314
I can't help you there, but I can help.

855
01:03:40,774 --> 01:03:42,608
Right here, right now.

856
01:03:42,735 --> 01:03:43,943
- If they catch you...
- They won't.

857
01:03:44,069 --> 01:03:46,655
- If they catch you...
- I'm the Queen's lady-in-waiting.

858
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:48,824
You, on the other hand,
are a wanted fugitive,

859
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:51,952
and about to steal
from the most powerful man in England.

860
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:54,622
Which one of us should be worried?

861
01:03:55,166 --> 01:03:56,166
Go.

862
01:03:56,584 --> 01:03:58,418
Go so that you can come back.

863
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:11,640
Now give me that hat.

864
01:04:19,275 --> 01:04:20,317
D'Artagnan!

865
01:04:20,401 --> 01:04:21,526
Get after him!

866
01:04:38,171 --> 01:04:39,171
Wait!

867
01:04:42,342 --> 01:04:44,677
The diamonds will be
in Buckingham's personal vault,

868
01:04:44,845 --> 01:04:48,348
located in the lowest, most secure level
of the Tower, next to the crown jewels.

869
01:04:48,516 --> 01:04:50,475
The lock is state of the art.

870
01:04:50,810 --> 01:04:53,354
Lt requires a key that Buckingham
carries on his person at all times.

871
01:04:53,438 --> 01:04:55,022
Corridor leading up to it is booby-trapped.

872
01:04:55,107 --> 01:04:56,607
Oh, I'm glad that's straightforward.

873
01:04:57,150 --> 01:04:59,944
Tempt anyone
with some bread and cheese, if you...

874
01:05:00,070 --> 01:05:02,447
You hadn't finished the briefing, actually.
I'm so sorry.

875
01:05:02,532 --> 01:05:04,241
Please don't tell me off.

876
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:07,202
Then it gets worse, a lot worse.

877
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:10,163
We have to cross three stone walls
and a moat.

878
01:05:10,414 --> 01:05:12,291
And there's just a couple of hundred
highly trained soldiers

879
01:05:12,376 --> 01:05:13,876
with a predilection for not being robbed.

880
01:05:14,378 --> 01:05:17,713
Although, since Buckingham undoubtedly
knows we're coming, thanks to Milady,

881
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:19,298
that number is likely to be greater.

882
01:05:19,383 --> 01:05:22,219
And why can't we just tell
Buckingham Milady is plotting against him?

883
01:05:22,303 --> 01:05:26,390
Because he wouldn't believe us.
Why should he? We're his sworn enemies.

884
01:05:27,517 --> 01:05:29,977
Besides, Milady would have made sure.

885
01:05:31,772 --> 01:05:32,981
Athos is coming.

886
01:05:34,483 --> 01:05:35,650
Tell me.

887
01:05:37,153 --> 01:05:39,237
What do you suppose he's after?

888
01:05:39,488 --> 01:05:41,115
What does it matter?

889
01:05:42,159 --> 01:05:46,829
Whatever it is, it's merely an excuse.
He wants revenge for Venice.

890
01:05:48,456 --> 01:05:49,958
He wants me.

891
01:05:50,918 --> 01:05:52,669
And he wants you.

892
01:05:55,506 --> 01:05:57,632
We shall have to be ready for him.

893
01:05:58,926 --> 01:06:00,094
Won't we?

894
01:06:01,597 --> 01:06:05,099
We can't outshoot them,
but we can outsmart them.

895
01:06:05,475 --> 01:06:08,019
He'll naturally favor
misdirection and deception.

896
01:06:08,270 --> 01:06:12,024
He knows we're expecting him,
but that just ups the ante.

897
01:06:12,692 --> 01:06:14,109
She knows us.

898
01:06:14,527 --> 01:06:17,613
What we look like, how we move,
how we think.

899
01:06:17,739 --> 01:06:20,116
He'll divide his forces, independent teams,

900
01:06:20,201 --> 01:06:23,328
each with their own point of entry
to maximize their chances.

901
01:06:23,412 --> 01:06:25,496
There are four of us. So we use...

902
01:06:25,581 --> 01:06:28,417
Well, there's five of
us, actually, if you...

903
01:06:31,171 --> 01:06:34,423
He's a skilled diver. He'll take the
aquatic route, through the Traitor's Gate.

904
01:06:37,428 --> 01:06:41,640
Aramis will undoubtedly rely
on agility and stealth.

905
01:06:42,391 --> 01:06:45,101
Check every tower, every rooftop.

906
01:06:47,606 --> 01:06:51,651
Porthos, on the other hand,
will employ brute strength.

907
01:06:52,903 --> 01:06:55,488
One of his preferred methods
is getting captured by the opposition.

908
01:07:00,453 --> 01:07:03,705
All the more reason
to take none of them alive.

909
01:07:05,667 --> 01:07:07,418
One more thing.

910
01:07:11,006 --> 01:07:13,758
They may try and drive a wedge between us.

911
01:07:14,093 --> 01:07:15,761
Claim to have secret information

912
01:07:15,845 --> 01:07:18,472
about some plot to get us
to turn against one another,

913
01:07:18,515 --> 01:07:22,893
like, say, I'm a double agent
working for the Cardinal

914
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:26,481
or you're looking to get rid of me.

915
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:33,863
I assure you,
nothing could be further from the truth.

916
01:07:36,285 --> 01:07:37,493
Although,

917
01:07:40,205 --> 01:07:43,249
I suppose I should

918
01:07:44,711 --> 01:07:47,838
search you for concealed weapons.

919
01:07:50,717 --> 01:07:52,134
That's how it's done.

920
01:07:54,054 --> 01:07:56,139
And that's exactly what she'll expect.

921
01:07:56,348 --> 01:07:59,642
So we do the unexpected.

922
01:08:01,061 --> 01:08:04,189
We go in broad daylight.
One man, hiding in plain sight.

923
01:08:04,232 --> 01:08:07,776
With all the extra security, there'll be
a lot of new faces, that's their weakness.

924
01:08:07,861 --> 01:08:11,071
And you, D'Artagnan, you're the wild card.

925
01:08:12,615 --> 01:08:14,701
We are the decoys.

926
01:08:15,077 --> 01:08:18,538
Now we'll try and create a distraction,
keep them occupied,

927
01:08:18,581 --> 01:08:20,498
keep them away from you
as much as possible,

928
01:08:20,583 --> 01:08:22,793
but, ultimately, it's down to you.

929
01:08:24,087 --> 01:08:26,047
You wanted to be a Musketeer?

930
01:08:26,089 --> 01:08:27,840
You want to serve France?

931
01:08:28,592 --> 01:08:29,884
This is your chance.

932
01:08:37,727 --> 01:08:40,729
Left, right, left, right, left!

933
01:08:41,105 --> 01:08:42,190
I thought you saw the signal!

934
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:45,360
- I saw you waving like an idiot!
- Well, that was the bloody signal!

935
01:08:45,444 --> 01:08:47,195
I'm trying to see things
from your point of view,

936
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:49,739
but, unfortunately,
I can't get my head that far up my ass!

937
01:08:49,823 --> 01:08:51,283
- Up your ass? I'll tell you what...
- Yes!

938
01:08:51,368 --> 01:08:52,659
That's enough of that!

939
01:08:54,162 --> 01:08:56,663
Finally, good,
at last, a peace officer!

940
01:08:56,790 --> 01:08:59,708
Now listen, Sergeant,
I would like you to arrest this man!

941
01:08:59,793 --> 01:09:00,794
Arrest me?

942
01:09:00,878 --> 01:09:02,170
You can't arrest me!

943
01:09:02,254 --> 01:09:04,631
Don't you tell me that!
I've lost my prized bantam!

944
01:09:04,673 --> 01:09:07,675
- Bantams? They are rotten!
- They are not rotten!

945
01:09:31,412 --> 01:09:34,747
Sir! The first of the Musketeers
has been arrested!

946
01:09:35,416 --> 01:09:37,166
The game is afoot.

947
01:09:37,751 --> 01:09:41,338
Bring him to me and double the guards.
Double the troops.

948
01:09:42,841 --> 01:09:44,258
Double everything.

949
01:09:44,926 --> 01:09:45,926
Sir!

950
01:09:46,594 --> 01:09:48,763
They'll come to us.

951
01:09:50,558 --> 01:09:52,016
Well, then.

952
01:09:52,268 --> 01:09:54,894
I think Your Lordship
has everything under control.

953
01:09:55,604 --> 01:09:58,357
You won't mind if I don't stay
to see how it all turns out?

954
01:09:59,985 --> 01:10:02,862
- Do you think I might lose?
- On the contrary.

955
01:10:02,904 --> 01:10:05,698
I have no issues with you killing Athos,

956
01:10:05,740 --> 01:10:08,201
but, if it's all the same to you,
I'd rather not watch him die.

957
01:10:11,622 --> 01:10:14,666
Tell me, what's your favorite color?

958
01:10:21,175 --> 01:10:22,216
Red.

959
01:10:23,218 --> 01:10:24,302
Why?

960
01:10:24,761 --> 01:10:27,514
I wanted to see
if you were capable of telling the truth.

961
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:30,225
Hmm.

962
01:10:40,404 --> 01:10:41,946
As far from here as possible.

963
01:10:55,963 --> 01:10:57,589
Well, well, well.

964
01:11:00,009 --> 01:11:03,053
Look at what the cat dragged in.

965
01:11:04,722 --> 01:11:06,807
So, how's the old Athos, eh?

966
01:11:08,727 --> 01:11:11,771
Still his surly,
insufferable self, I'm sure.

967
01:11:12,064 --> 01:11:15,400
Sending a boy to do a man's job.

968
01:11:16,361 --> 01:11:18,195
I should feel insulted.

969
01:11:20,782 --> 01:11:23,367
Well, what were you after anyway, eh?

970
01:11:25,454 --> 01:11:28,831
Secrets, spies, it's all a game, really.

971
01:11:29,124 --> 01:11:32,669
Although the price of loss,
as you'll come to discover,

972
01:11:33,045 --> 01:11:34,922
is a little bit higher.

973
01:11:37,008 --> 01:11:38,092
What?

974
01:11:39,386 --> 01:11:40,761
No last words?

975
01:11:42,055 --> 01:11:43,097
No insults?

976
01:11:43,558 --> 01:11:45,934
- Pleas for mercy or...
- What time is it?

977
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:53,109
About 2:00, I'd say.
Why? Are you in a hurry?

978
01:11:56,405 --> 01:11:57,947
Look out of the window.

979
01:12:05,498 --> 01:12:08,125
They weren't the decoys. I was.

980
01:12:39,452 --> 01:12:40,535
Ahhh!

981
01:13:13,281 --> 01:13:14,740
Permission to come aboard?

982
01:13:14,783 --> 01:13:15,908
Granted.

983
01:13:33,804 --> 01:13:35,429
Athos!

984
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:57,287
The wonderful thing about fighting
an imaginary opponent, Captain Rochefort,

985
01:13:57,789 --> 01:14:00,958
is that he's always greatly skilled
yet easily defeated.

986
01:14:01,334 --> 01:14:02,376
Eminence.

987
01:14:03,712 --> 01:14:06,755
The pride of victory
without the risk of loss.

988
01:14:07,717 --> 01:14:10,427
I trust you didn't come here to impress me
with your swordsmanship.

989
01:14:10,678 --> 01:14:13,596
No, Your Eminence. I have some good news.

990
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:15,724
Such as?

991
01:14:30,908 --> 01:14:34,453
So what about the diamonds?
Doesn't Buckingham still have them?

992
01:14:34,495 --> 01:14:35,580
Nope.

993
01:14:36,457 --> 01:14:37,957
Milady likes hedging her bets.

994
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
She'd never have taken the chance

995
01:14:39,084 --> 01:14:40,668
we'd actually succeed
in breaking into the vault.

996
01:14:42,379 --> 01:14:44,130
So where are they now?

997
01:14:44,506 --> 01:14:46,967
With the only person she trusts.

998
01:14:52,849 --> 01:14:54,768
Which means we've lost her
and all this has been for nothing.

999
01:14:54,852 --> 01:14:56,394
I wouldn't say that.

1000
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:05,070
You were the decoy, we were the extraction,

1001
01:15:05,155 --> 01:15:08,616
but the real linchpin of the plan, well,

1002
01:15:09,493 --> 01:15:11,452
that was someone else entirely.

1003
01:15:14,749 --> 01:15:17,250
Someone even Milady would never suspect.

1004
01:15:22,215 --> 01:15:24,550
Driver! What the hell is going on?

1005
01:15:24,635 --> 01:15:27,762
Just following your instructions, ma'am.
"As far away from here as possible."

1006
01:15:57,420 --> 01:15:59,171
Whoo-hoo!

1007
01:16:11,854 --> 01:16:15,106
Planchet. Never thought
I'd hear myself say this, but

1008
01:16:15,816 --> 01:16:16,816
well done.

1009
01:16:17,442 --> 01:16:18,442
Thank you, sir.

1010
01:16:19,528 --> 01:16:21,113
That means a lot,
especially coming from you.

1011
01:16:21,155 --> 01:16:22,239
Shut up, Planchet.

1012
01:16:22,323 --> 01:16:23,448
Yes, sir.

1013
01:16:30,833 --> 01:16:31,958
Don't.

1014
01:16:35,254 --> 01:16:37,589
We took the precaution
of removing the gunpowder.

1015
01:16:44,681 --> 01:16:45,806
What now?

1016
01:16:46,141 --> 01:16:49,436
You give me the diamonds
or I take them off your corpse.

1017
01:16:49,478 --> 01:16:50,812
Dealer's choice.

1018
01:16:54,317 --> 01:16:56,735
- Anything else you'd like me to take off?
- Outside.

1019
01:17:09,834 --> 01:17:10,959
Boys.

1020
01:17:11,836 --> 01:17:13,211
Been a while.

1021
01:17:16,549 --> 01:17:18,343
This must be the young Gascon.

1022
01:17:19,511 --> 01:17:20,845
We've met before.

1023
01:17:22,473 --> 01:17:23,473
Ah, yes.

1024
01:17:24,141 --> 01:17:26,100
Small world.

1025
01:17:28,188 --> 01:17:30,147
I didn't let Rochefort kill you.

1026
01:17:31,608 --> 01:17:33,734
You do remember that, don't you?

1027
01:17:41,285 --> 01:17:43,703
- Did you kill Buckingham?
- No.

1028
01:17:44,664 --> 01:17:46,748
- But you will kill me?
- Yes.

1029
01:17:50,087 --> 01:17:51,545
You would spare him, but kill me?

1030
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:54,465
Yes. I don't hate Buckingham.

1031
01:18:03,726 --> 01:18:04,851
Here.

1032
01:18:05,561 --> 01:18:07,271
You may find use for this.

1033
01:18:10,526 --> 01:18:11,776
Move.

1034
01:18:45,732 --> 01:18:46,773
Athos.

1035
01:19:05,295 --> 01:19:09,465
At least she died the way she lived,
on her own terms.

1036
01:19:12,928 --> 01:19:14,512
She did it for me.

1037
01:19:16,515 --> 01:19:20,769
I wouldn't have been able to live
with myself had I pulled the trigger.

1038
01:19:23,398 --> 01:19:24,982
Come on, let's go home.

1039
01:19:38,539 --> 01:19:40,082
But I can't get it.

1040
01:19:40,666 --> 01:19:42,168
How marvelous!

1041
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:46,506
Oh! So great!

1042
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:56,016
Oh!

1043
01:19:57,811 --> 01:19:59,186
Your Majesty.

1044
01:19:59,771 --> 01:20:00,855
My dear.

1045
01:20:01,524 --> 01:20:03,024
You look troubled.

1046
01:20:03,192 --> 01:20:06,152
Hardly. Your Majesty just startled me.

1047
01:20:06,904 --> 01:20:08,404
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1048
01:20:08,864 --> 01:20:11,367
I just wanted to drop by

1049
01:20:11,451 --> 01:20:13,285
and tell you how much
I was looking forward to tonight.

1050
01:20:14,371 --> 01:20:18,874
Should be quite spectacular, you know.
Costumes, fireworks and such.

1051
01:20:19,793 --> 01:20:21,086
But you,

1052
01:20:22,755 --> 01:20:25,173
you shall be
the most spectacular sight of all.

1053
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:28,760
And especially since
you'll wear the diamonds.

1054
01:20:29,220 --> 01:20:31,264
You will wear them, won't you?

1055
01:20:32,891 --> 01:20:35,309
Well, it's very important
to me that you do.

1056
01:20:37,437 --> 01:20:39,690
Then I shall wear them, Your Majesty.

1057
01:20:41,234 --> 01:20:42,442
Until tonight, then.

1058
01:20:52,454 --> 01:20:54,080
She promised she'll wear them.

1059
01:20:55,749 --> 01:20:57,584
You do think she'll wear them,
don't you, Richelieu?

1060
01:20:58,336 --> 01:21:00,713
I'm sure she will, Your Majesty.

1061
01:21:00,922 --> 01:21:02,423
I'm sure she will.

1062
01:21:30,705 --> 01:21:32,456
I hate air travel!

1063
01:21:47,682 --> 01:21:48,766
Damn!

1064
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:21,009
Hard to starboard!

1065
01:22:35,443 --> 01:22:36,735
Well, now that we have their attention,

1066
01:22:36,820 --> 01:22:39,029
let's see if we can settle this
in a peaceful manner.

1067
01:22:39,614 --> 01:22:41,073
More or less.

1068
01:22:43,076 --> 01:22:44,953
Ah, Gascon!

1069
01:22:45,579 --> 01:22:48,540
So you've traded up
when it comes to transport.

1070
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,500
But, once again, you're outmatched.

1071
01:22:50,876 --> 01:22:52,711
You can thank Milady for that.

1072
01:22:52,795 --> 01:22:55,673
She passed on Buckingham's plans
a long time ago.

1073
01:22:55,757 --> 01:22:58,342
As you can see,
we made some improvements.

1074
01:23:00,345 --> 01:23:01,554
Isn't she a beauty?

1075
01:23:01,722 --> 01:23:03,015
What do you want?

1076
01:23:05,268 --> 01:23:06,351
The diamonds.

1077
01:23:06,894 --> 01:23:08,729
- Come and take them.
- Gladly!

1078
01:23:09,564 --> 01:23:12,692
You see, I can blast you out of the sky
with total impunity.

1079
01:23:12,776 --> 01:23:14,110
If you fire on me, on the other hand,

1080
01:23:14,194 --> 01:23:16,321
you'll be killing
Miss Oh-so-young-and-pretty.

1081
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:21,744
You have 60 seconds.

1082
01:23:23,705 --> 01:23:25,539
He'll shoot us down
the moment he has the diamonds.

1083
01:23:25,582 --> 01:23:26,623
We can't outrun them.

1084
01:23:26,750 --> 01:23:28,250
And we can't fight them, damn it! We can't.

1085
01:23:28,293 --> 01:23:30,586
- Oh, D'Artagnan.
- What?

1086
01:23:30,879 --> 01:23:33,715
Do you think
you have the monopoly on loss?

1087
01:23:33,883 --> 01:23:35,050
What if she dies?

1088
01:23:35,092 --> 01:23:36,634
The life of one woman
or the future of France,

1089
01:23:36,761 --> 01:23:38,636
what would you do
if you were in my position?

1090
01:23:41,099 --> 01:23:43,601
I've made a lot of sacrifices,
a lot of hard choices.

1091
01:23:43,769 --> 01:23:46,771
For honor, for King, for country.
You wanna know what I've learned, boy?

1092
01:23:46,813 --> 01:23:49,940
Hard choices and sacrifices
do not keep you warm at night.

1093
01:23:50,275 --> 01:23:54,404
Life is too damn short and too damn long
to go through without someone at your side.

1094
01:23:54,447 --> 01:23:56,114
Don't end up like me.

1095
01:23:56,991 --> 01:24:00,286
Choose the woman.
Fight for love, D'Artagnan.

1096
01:24:01,121 --> 01:24:03,122
France will take care of itself.

1097
01:24:05,042 --> 01:24:06,292
Time's up!

1098
01:24:09,923 --> 01:24:10,964
An exchange.

1099
01:24:12,133 --> 01:24:15,386
I go aboard your ship with the diamonds,
the girl comes aboard ours.

1100
01:24:16,054 --> 01:24:17,596
Once I know she's safe,

1101
01:24:18,306 --> 01:24:20,141
I give them to you.

1102
01:24:20,309 --> 01:24:24,145
Fine. But I want to see the diamonds first.

1103
01:24:24,897 --> 01:24:26,064
Planchet.

1104
01:24:28,610 --> 01:24:30,152
Cut her loose.

1105
01:24:32,489 --> 01:24:34,990
- Deploy the gangway!
- Deploy the gangway!

1106
01:24:44,919 --> 01:24:46,002
Satisfied?

1107
01:25:31,888 --> 01:25:33,889
You never learn, do you?

1108
01:25:41,190 --> 01:25:42,231
Fire!

1109
01:25:47,322 --> 01:25:48,405
Hard right!

1110
01:25:48,907 --> 01:25:50,507
Fire!

1111
01:26:20,191 --> 01:26:21,274
Good.

1112
01:26:21,859 --> 01:26:23,945
I really want you to see this.

1113
01:26:24,112 --> 01:26:25,404
Finish them off!

1114
01:26:27,616 --> 01:26:29,617
We can't outrun them
and we can't outgun them.

1115
01:26:29,743 --> 01:26:32,578
We could try asking them to surrender,
but somehow I don't think it would work.

1116
01:26:32,621 --> 01:26:34,456
We hide. In there.

1117
01:26:41,714 --> 01:26:42,966
Fire!

1118
01:26:43,133 --> 01:26:44,300
Fire!

1119
01:27:02,905 --> 01:27:04,155
Lay in a pursuit course!

1120
01:27:04,323 --> 01:27:06,616
Lay in a pursuit course!

1121
01:27:06,659 --> 01:27:07,784
Fire!

1122
01:27:13,333 --> 01:27:15,126
He's persistent, I'll give him that!

1123
01:27:16,670 --> 01:27:17,670
Fire!

1124
01:27:22,010 --> 01:27:25,053
But, sir! We can't go into the storm!

1125
01:27:29,392 --> 01:27:30,435
Anyone?

1126
01:27:31,020 --> 01:27:33,479
Anyone else who wants to question orders?

1127
01:27:36,025 --> 01:27:37,108
Good.

1128
01:27:52,918 --> 01:27:56,838
Sir, now might be a good time
to talk about the possibility of a raise?

1129
01:27:56,881 --> 01:27:58,048
Shut up, Planchet.

1130
01:27:58,174 --> 01:27:59,383
Yes, sir.

1131
01:28:17,195 --> 01:28:18,237
Where are they?

1132
01:28:20,908 --> 01:28:22,784
You're never gonna find them in there.

1133
01:28:23,577 --> 01:28:25,370
I beg to differ.

1134
01:28:41,347 --> 01:28:43,181
Keep after them!

1135
01:28:43,349 --> 01:28:45,433
I'll take the Gascon!

1136
01:28:47,270 --> 01:28:48,521
Hard to starboard!

1137
01:29:16,219 --> 01:29:18,053
You know what your problem is, boy?

1138
01:29:18,138 --> 01:29:22,391
You read too many books,
and then you believed them.

1139
01:29:23,643 --> 01:29:25,520
Courage, honor.

1140
01:29:26,689 --> 01:29:27,814
All for one.

1141
01:29:28,816 --> 01:29:31,901
But history isn't written by heroes,
it's written by victors.

1142
01:29:32,236 --> 01:29:34,028
Keep your eyes open!

1143
01:29:43,999 --> 01:29:45,375
Round two.

1144
01:29:45,543 --> 01:29:46,668
Oh...

1145
01:29:57,222 --> 01:29:58,723
Return fire!

1146
01:30:08,485 --> 01:30:09,735
Pull up, damn it!

1147
01:30:09,903 --> 01:30:11,069
We're too heavy!

1148
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:15,074
You scared to take me in a fair fight?

1149
01:30:16,410 --> 01:30:17,660
Hardly.

1150
01:30:18,579 --> 01:30:20,288
I just don't fight fair.

1151
01:30:22,249 --> 01:30:27,129
Captain Rochefort!

1152
01:30:28,048 --> 01:30:29,089
Oh, well.

1153
01:30:46,610 --> 01:30:48,069
Drop the ballast!

1154
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:49,695
Drop everything!

1155
01:30:50,113 --> 01:30:51,824
And fire up the burners!

1156
01:30:51,908 --> 01:30:53,617
Over the side!

1157
01:30:54,536 --> 01:30:55,953
Drop those barrels!

1158
01:30:56,120 --> 01:30:58,038
Faster! Move!

1159
01:31:09,885 --> 01:31:11,011
Shall we?

1160
01:31:21,232 --> 01:31:22,357
Hold on!

1161
01:31:26,696 --> 01:31:27,821
Get out of the way!

1162
01:31:29,115 --> 01:31:30,616
Go! Run!

1163
01:32:43,155 --> 01:32:46,825
I still have the diamonds.
What do you propose to do about that?

1164
01:32:47,369 --> 01:32:48,452
Kill you.

1165
01:32:56,963 --> 01:32:58,380
If you insist.

1166
01:33:08,266 --> 01:33:09,392
Oh!

1167
01:35:30,507 --> 01:35:32,216
You should've stayed in Gascony, boy.

1168
01:35:40,893 --> 01:35:43,436
You should've apologized to my horse.

1169
01:36:18,143 --> 01:36:21,103
Surround the palace!
Shoot the Musketeers on sight!

1170
01:36:21,146 --> 01:36:24,773
Use every man at your disposal!
Any means necessary!

1171
01:36:24,941 --> 01:36:26,693
- Your Eminence!
- Don't interrupt!

1172
01:36:26,861 --> 01:36:28,695
These men must not...

1173
01:36:54,682 --> 01:36:56,017
Arrest these men!

1174
01:37:03,651 --> 01:37:04,693
What is the meaning of this?

1175
01:37:06,738 --> 01:37:08,489
Your Majesty, these men...

1176
01:37:08,573 --> 01:37:11,825
Are delivering a gift for Your Majesty.
Compliments of the Cardinal.

1177
01:37:13,536 --> 01:37:15,997
Cardinal, you shouldn't have.

1178
01:37:18,334 --> 01:37:21,962
Well, Your Majesty did ask me
to get you one of those, so...

1179
01:37:22,129 --> 01:37:23,714
So I did.

1180
01:37:26,927 --> 01:37:28,761
But what happened to it?

1181
01:37:29,096 --> 01:37:31,597
Buckingham's spy, Rochefort,
attempted to sabotage the craft.

1182
01:37:31,682 --> 01:37:33,517
- He's been dealt with.
- Rochefort?

1183
01:37:34,227 --> 01:37:36,061
He's Captain of your guards, isn't he?

1184
01:37:36,229 --> 01:37:37,271
Actually,

1185
01:37:37,647 --> 01:37:41,066
His Eminence was the one
who uncovered the traitor.

1186
01:37:44,947 --> 01:37:47,949
"lt is by my order
and for the good of the State

1187
01:37:48,033 --> 01:37:52,162
"that the bearer of this
has done what has been done."

1188
01:37:53,748 --> 01:37:57,334
- That's your signature, isn't it, Richelieu?
- It would appear so, Your Majesty.

1189
01:37:57,502 --> 01:37:59,420
Well, let me get this right.

1190
01:37:59,587 --> 01:38:04,175
You brought me an airship
and exposed a snake in our midst?

1191
01:38:04,760 --> 01:38:06,845
How can I ever repay you?

1192
01:38:07,013 --> 01:38:08,930
I could think of a few ways.

1193
01:38:10,182 --> 01:38:11,182
Anne.

1194
01:38:12,561 --> 01:38:14,895
I was just returning from the jewelers.

1195
01:38:17,899 --> 01:38:19,859
Well, I realize it's a little early,

1196
01:38:20,527 --> 01:38:23,071
but the orchestra's here and so are we.

1197
01:38:24,073 --> 01:38:26,241
Would Your Majesty care to dance?

1198
01:38:26,826 --> 01:38:28,368
I would love to.

1199
01:38:31,540 --> 01:38:33,416
Well, mind out, you fellows!

1200
01:38:33,709 --> 01:38:34,876
D'Artagnan.

1201
01:38:35,919 --> 01:38:36,919
Well, well, well.

1202
01:38:38,839 --> 01:38:41,592
Looks like you aren't the only one
who gets the girl.

1203
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:43,886
Your Majesty is a natural.

1204
01:38:45,180 --> 01:38:46,472
Guess I am.

1205
01:38:47,557 --> 01:38:49,266
As a matter of fact,

1206
01:38:49,434 --> 01:38:52,854
I think you'll start noticing
a few more changes around here.

1207
01:38:54,190 --> 01:38:55,190
Thank you.

1208
01:38:57,109 --> 01:38:58,318
For everything.

1209
01:38:58,569 --> 01:38:59,862
Any time.

1210
01:39:01,782 --> 01:39:03,032
Well, strike up, then!

1211
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:04,408
Your Majesty!

1212
01:39:05,035 --> 01:39:06,660
Positions, please, gentlemen!

1213
01:39:12,085 --> 01:39:13,210
Well-played.

1214
01:39:23,263 --> 01:39:24,722
I could use men like you.

1215
01:39:30,188 --> 01:39:31,271
I already have a job.

1216
01:39:31,356 --> 01:39:33,649
- I'm a drunk.
- I'm independently wealthy.

1217
01:39:33,817 --> 01:39:35,484
Thanks, but no.

1218
01:39:37,405 --> 01:39:40,031
The day will come
when you'll wish you had said, "Yes".

1219
01:39:40,199 --> 01:39:41,324
Maybe.

1220
01:39:41,492 --> 01:39:42,700
But not today.

1221
01:39:43,035 --> 01:39:44,828
Maybe not today.

1222
01:39:55,841 --> 01:39:56,883
Enjoying the show?

1223
01:39:57,176 --> 01:39:59,010
Are you always this cocky?

1224
01:39:59,178 --> 01:40:00,512
Only on Tuesdays

1225
01:40:00,555 --> 01:40:02,889
and whenever beautiful women are involved.

1226
01:40:03,057 --> 01:40:05,016
So you think I'm beautiful.

1227
01:40:06,395 --> 01:40:08,104
Actually, it's Tuesday.

1228
01:40:34,885 --> 01:40:37,928
- So, what now?
- We drink.

1229
01:40:38,388 --> 01:40:39,388
And then what?

1230
01:40:39,431 --> 01:40:42,683
Wherever they send us.
Whatever France needs.

1231
01:40:43,351 --> 01:40:45,770
I thought you didn't believe
in that stuff anymore.

1232
01:40:46,939 --> 01:40:48,440
I believe in us.

1233
01:40:49,233 --> 01:40:50,609
Till the day I stop believing that,

1234
01:40:50,735 --> 01:40:54,071
there are still things in this world
worth fighting and dying for.

1235
01:41:00,037 --> 01:41:01,120
All for one!

1236
01:41:01,205 --> 01:41:02,747
And one for all!

1237
01:41:04,542 --> 01:41:06,251
You know, sirs,

1238
01:41:06,419 --> 01:41:11,590
I know you can be mean, tough,
foul-tempered bastards,

1239
01:41:11,633 --> 01:41:15,637
but sometimes I get the feeling
that deep down you're all...

1240
01:41:15,763 --> 01:41:18,139
Shut up, Planchet!

1241
01:41:18,599 --> 01:41:20,308
Yeah, yeah, of course.

1242
01:41:33,616 --> 01:41:37,285
In case you're wondering,
this isn't the afterlife.

1243
01:41:38,287 --> 01:41:39,788
I'm not dead,

1244
01:41:40,122 --> 01:41:42,041
and neither are you.

1245
01:41:46,588 --> 01:41:47,713
What?

1246
01:41:50,217 --> 01:41:51,301
How did you...

1247
01:41:51,594 --> 01:41:53,595
Followed Athos.

1248
01:41:54,138 --> 01:41:55,973
We fished you out of the Channel.

1249
01:42:01,230 --> 01:42:04,148
- Where are we going?
- To France, of course.

1250
01:42:05,985 --> 01:42:07,485
Sail away!

1251
01:42:07,653 --> 01:42:12,449
To get back what's mine
and pay back, with interest.

1252
01:42:12,617 --> 01:42:14,451
Roll ballast!

1253
01:42:46,863 --> 01:42:50,617
# When we were young
# The world seemed so old.

1254
01:42:50,701 --> 01:42:52,744
# Careless and cold.

1255
01:42:52,828 --> 01:42:56,581
# We did what we were told in our lives.

1256
01:42:58,083 --> 01:43:00,210
# When we were young.

1257
01:43:02,964 --> 01:43:05,591
# Had the world by the tail.

1258
01:43:05,675 --> 01:43:09,971
# Good would prevail
# Starships would sail.

1259
01:43:10,056 --> 01:43:13,642
# And none of us would fail in this life.

1260
01:43:14,894 --> 01:43:17,396
# Not when you're young.

1261
01:43:20,067 --> 01:43:24,695
# We were drawn to whoever
# Could keep us together.

1262
01:43:24,738 --> 01:43:28,116
# And bound by the heavens above.

1263
01:43:28,701 --> 01:43:31,370
# And we tried to survive.

1264
01:43:31,412 --> 01:43:34,581
# Traveling at the speed of love.

1265
01:43:36,919 --> 01:43:40,755
# Whoa-oh-oh, when we were young.

1266
01:43:41,548 --> 01:43:45,551
# When we adored the fabulous.

1267
01:43:45,594 --> 01:43:49,682
# Whoa-oh-oh, when we were young.

1268
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:53,977
# We were the foolish fearless.

1269
01:43:54,104 --> 01:43:58,942
# Never knowing the cost of what we paid.

1270
01:43:58,984 --> 01:44:02,612
# Letting someone else be strong.

1271
01:44:02,655 --> 01:44:08,285
# Whoa-oh-oh, when we were young.

1272
01:44:11,456 --> 01:44:16,002
# In a moment of grace
# A long leap of faith.

1273
01:44:16,087 --> 01:44:21,717
# The still more glorious
dawn awaits my life.

1274
01:44:23,594 --> 01:44:28,599
# I'm here with the lovers.

1275
01:44:28,642 --> 01:44:33,521
# And we burned the bridges
# We're crossing over.

1276
01:44:33,772 --> 01:44:37,651
# Just to see the firelight.

1277
01:44:37,694 --> 01:44:44,200
# And the innocent are getting over
# Being old tonight.

1278
01:44:45,494 --> 01:44:49,247
# Whoa-oh-oh, when we were young.

1279
01:44:50,082 --> 01:44:53,919
# When everything was what it seemed.

1280
01:44:54,087 --> 01:44:58,048
# Whoa-oh-oh, when we were young.

1281
01:44:58,717 --> 01:45:02,428
# And every day was how we dreamed.

1282
01:45:02,680 --> 01:45:07,434
# Never knowing the cost of what we paid.

1283
01:45:07,518 --> 01:45:10,729
# Letting someone else be strong.

1284
01:45:11,272 --> 01:45:16,736
# Whoa-oh-oh, when we were young.

1285
01:45:20,157 --> 01:45:24,036
# And when you look at yourself tonight.

1286
01:45:24,412 --> 01:45:28,248
# Are you someone you recognize?

1287
01:45:29,501 --> 01:45:32,962
# You can take back what you've given away.

1288
01:45:33,047 --> 01:45:36,716
# But it must be the last time.

1289
01:45:39,178 --> 01:45:42,179
# Whoa-oh-oh, when we were young.

1290
01:45:54,403 --> 01:45:56,279
# When we were young.

1291
01:45:56,364 --> 01:46:00,243
# Whoa-oh-oh, when we were young.

1292
01:46:00,786 --> 01:46:04,747
