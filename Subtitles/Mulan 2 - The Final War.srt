without the use of force.

Instead, we will forge a union so strong,
the Mongol hordes won't dare attack.

357
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:28,648
An alliance
with the kingdom of Qui Gong.

through marriage.

359

You will escort three princesses
to Qui Gong.

Lord Chin's sons. . .

If this wedding does not take place
in three days,

365
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:52,255
the alliance will crumble
and the Mongols will destroy us.

366
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:56,259
Mark my words, General, three days.

Not a moment more, Your Majesty.

What troubles you?

369
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,477
Your Majesty, an arranged marriage?

They consider it an honor
to marry in the cause of peace.

General, how many troops
do you estimate you will need

377
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,251
to accomplish this mission?

378
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,461
-Three.
-Three companies?

These are my children.

This mission does not call for force,
but finesse.

382

with the countryside.

I implore you
to choose your three soldiers wisely.

386

l'll show you worlds you've never seen

1450
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:27,082
The sun and moon and shadows

1451
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:33,004
The rainbow's arch
The mountain stream

1452
01:16:33,172 --> 01:16:38,385
The summer's cIouds

1453
01:16:38,552 --> 01:16:44,224
And the winter's dreams

1454

l'll play you sounds
You've never heard

1455
01:16:50,898 --> 01:16:56,027
The waterfaII
The river

1456
01:16:56,195 --> 01:17:01,950
The thunder of the hummingbird

1457
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:07,747
The whisper of the snow

1458
01:17:09,542 --> 01:17:12,752
What if you never know

1459
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:15,547
How much you cared

1460
01:17:15,715 --> 01:17:22,137
Till you are parted
By a stormy sea

1461
01:17:22,555 --> 01:17:26,141
How could l let you go?

1462
01:17:26,309 --> 01:17:29,227
How couId I bear

1463
01:17:29,395 --> 01:17:32,105
My life without you

1464
01:17:32,273 --> 01:17:37,902
Here with me?

1465
01:17:38,112 --> 01:17:43,825
The worId's a door
That's open wide

1466
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:48,788
Because you're here beside me

1467
01:17:49,415 --> 01:17:56,129
And with the moon and sun
To guide me

1468
01:17:56,672 --> 01:18:01,676
Now my heart can fly

1469
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:06,139
Now our hearts

1470
01:18:06,307 --> 01:18:12,604
Can be

1471
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:20,111
Free

1471
01:18:21,305 --> 01:19:21,686
