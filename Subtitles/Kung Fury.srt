1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:16,647
Hey, you got a permit
for those guns?

3
00:00:17,714 --> 00:00:19,615
I got your permit right here.

4
00:00:30,061 --> 00:00:31,495
Catchy tune.

5
00:00:39,486 --> 00:00:41,985
Fuck this game.

6
00:00:42,085 --> 00:00:44,020
FUCK YOU!

7
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:22,195
We need backup,
we need Kung Fury.

8
00:01:37,938 --> 00:01:40,172
Yeah, that's my bicep.

9
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,141
One second babe.

10
00:01:43,634 --> 00:01:45,500
Hello?

11
00:01:45,601 --> 00:01:47,734
<i>
We got an arcade machine
down here going crazy,</i>

12
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:48,935
<i> it is killing everybody,
it's destruction,
chaos, terror-</i>

13
00:01:50,868 --> 00:01:51,969
What are you gonna do?

14
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:53,169
My job.

15
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,596
Game over.

16
00:03:07,877 --> 00:03:11,679
<i> I'm a cop and
damn good at my job.</i>

17
00:03:11,886 --> 00:03:13,988
<i> It all began years ago.</i>

18
00:03:14,088 --> 00:03:15,454
<i> In the line of duty,</i>

19
00:03:15,554 --> 00:03:16,821
<i> me and my partner were
chasing  down</i>

20
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,255
<i> a mysterious Kung Fu-master.</i>

21
00:03:20,355 --> 00:03:21,856
<i>
You're under arrest, punk.</i>

22
00:03:21,956 --> 00:03:23,223
<i> Show us your hands.</i>

23
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:26,656
<i> Good work, Dragon.</i>

24
00:03:26,757 --> 00:03:28,790
<i> That crazy stunt could've
killed us both.</i>

25
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:31,324
<i> But goddammit, you're the
best partner I've ever had.</i>

26
00:03:31,424 --> 00:03:34,459
<i> Thanks,
I learned from the best.</i>

27
00:03:34,892 --> 00:03:36,926
<i> You're like a father to me.</i>

28
00:03:37,026 --> 00:03:39,760
<i>
With one fatal blow,
he hit my partner.</i>

29
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,961
<i> I could tell
he was dead straight off.</i>

30
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:53,063
<i>
Before I could pull the trigger</i>

31
00:03:53,163 --> 00:03:56,663
<i> I was hit by lightning
and bitten by a cobra.</i>

32
00:03:56,763 --> 00:03:58,930
<i> I blacked out.</i>

33
00:04:01,498 --> 00:04:04,699
<i> And saw images of ancient
Shaolin temples and monks,</i>

34
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,999
<i> mastering the art of Kung Fu.</i>

35
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:08,533
<i> There was an ancient prophecy,</i>

36
00:04:08,632 --> 00:04:11,033
<i> about a new form
of Kung Fu so powerful,</i>

37
00:04:11,134 --> 00:04:13,201
<i> only one man could master it.</i>

38
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:14,535
<i> The chosen one.</i>

39
00:04:16,535 --> 00:04:17,850
<i> When I woke up,</i>

40
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,085
<i> I saw the Kung Fu master
running towards me.</i>

41
00:04:20,535 --> 00:04:22,503
<i> I could feel my body mutate</i>

42
00:04:22,603 --> 00:04:24,698
<i> into some sort of
Kung Fu freak of nature.</i>

43
00:04:36,973 --> 00:04:38,207
<i> You!</i>

44
00:04:39,106 --> 00:04:40,507
<i> You are the chosen one!</i>

45
00:04:42,373 --> 00:04:44,575
<i> - Knock, knock.
- Who's there?</i>

46
00:04:45,608 --> 00:04:47,209
<i> Knuckles.</i>

47
00:05:07,814 --> 00:05:09,579
<i>
As a memento,</i>

48
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:11,755
<i> I put on a strip of cloth
from the dead Kung Fu master.</i>

49
00:05:12,547 --> 00:05:15,148
<i> I decided I would use
my new super Kung Fu powers</i>

50
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,715
<i> to fight crime.</i>

51
00:05:16,815 --> 00:05:18,582
<i> So, I became
the best cop in the world.</i>

52
00:05:18,682 --> 00:05:21,249
<i> I became, Kung Fury.</i>

53
00:06:12,727 --> 00:06:13,816
I don't wanna hear it Kung Fury.

54
00:06:13,816 --> 00:06:17,417
I just got back from city hall,
$50 million worth of damages,

55
00:06:18,362 --> 00:06:21,662
and I got the mayor up
my ass like a fag on Viagra.

56
00:06:21,762 --> 00:06:25,497
How am I going to explain
this to the press, hm?

57
00:06:25,596 --> 00:06:29,231
You just destroyed an entire
city block for Christ's sake.

58
00:06:29,331 --> 00:06:31,131
Didn't you tell me
to block it out?

59
00:06:31,231 --> 00:06:32,799
I told you do it by the book.

60
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:34,199
Cut the bullshit.

61
00:06:34,299 --> 00:06:35,600
Nobody else could have stopped

62
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,667
that arcade machine
and you know it.

63
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,704
Oh man, listen to me Kung Fury.

64
00:06:42,867 --> 00:06:46,368
You need to start following
the rules like the rest of us,

65
00:06:46,468 --> 00:06:48,469
so I'm assigning you
a new partner.

66
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,603
What?
Hell no, I work alone.

67
00:06:50,694 --> 00:06:52,161
Not anymore you don't.

68
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:55,870
Say hi to your new partner,
Triceracop.

69
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,723
Very nice meeting you Kung Fury,

70
00:06:57,723 --> 00:06:59,768
looking forward to
working with you.

71
00:06:59,768 --> 00:07:01,768
<i> You're like a father to me.</i>

72
00:07:04,721 --> 00:07:06,489
I work alone.

73
00:07:06,939 --> 00:07:09,174
Either you team up
with Triceracop,

74
00:07:09,274 --> 00:07:10,720
or you're off the case.

75
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,254
I'm not off the case,

76
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:13,775
I quit.

77
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:28,011
Yeah Yeah, I did the blood test.

78
00:07:28,111 --> 00:07:29,812
It was positive, yeah?

79
00:07:29,912 --> 00:07:30,697
<i>
What the hell
are you talking about?</i>

80
00:07:30,697 --> 00:07:32,398
Yeah no problem.

81
00:07:32,812 --> 00:07:33,946
Give me the phone.

82
00:07:40,381 --> 00:07:42,681
What the hell is this?

83
00:07:44,654 --> 00:07:48,355
<i>- Chief McNickles speaking.
- Is this the police?</i>

84
00:07:48,482 --> 00:07:50,916
<i> - Yeah, this is the police.
- Fuck you!</i>

85
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,321
MALFUNCTIONING?

86
00:08:09,554 --> 00:08:12,055
I need someone
to trace that call!

87
00:08:12,155 --> 00:08:14,021
But that's impossible!

88
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:15,522
Not for me it isn't.

89
00:08:22,824 --> 00:08:24,909
<i>
Hackerman, he's the most
powerful hacker of all time.</i>

90
00:08:29,525 --> 00:08:30,593
Follow me.

91
00:08:33,859 --> 00:08:36,093
I was able to triangulate
the cell phone signal

92
00:08:36,193 --> 00:08:37,460
and trace the caller.

93
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,061
His name is Adolf Hitler.

94
00:08:41,161 --> 00:08:44,176
Hitler, he's the worst
criminal of all time.

95
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:45,862
Do you know him, sir?

96
00:08:45,962 --> 00:08:47,396
I guess you could say that.

97
00:08:47,497 --> 00:08:51,197
In the 1940's,
Hitler was a Kung Fu champion.

98
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,063
<i>
He was so good at Kung Fu,</i>

99
00:08:53,163 --> 00:08:56,731
<i> that he decided to change
his name to Kung FÃ¼hrer.</i>

100
00:08:57,832 --> 00:08:59,298
<i> But he didn't stop there.</i>

101
00:08:59,398 --> 00:09:01,365
<i> He knew of
the Kung Fury prophecy,</i>

102
00:09:01,466 --> 00:09:03,198
<i> and wanted to claim the throne.</i>

103
00:09:03,298 --> 00:09:05,433
<i> He and his posse of
Nazi soldiers</i>

104
00:09:05,533 --> 00:09:07,334
<i> conducted experiments
for years.</i>

105
00:09:18,537 --> 00:09:20,136
<i> But they weren't able
to figure out</i>

106
00:09:20,236 --> 00:09:22,737
<i> how to master the art
of Kung Fury.</i>

107
00:09:23,836 --> 00:09:25,303
<i> And one day,</i>

108
00:09:25,404 --> 00:09:27,571
<i> he disappeared
from the face of the earth.</i>

109
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,905
<i> And no-one has seen him
ever since.</i>

110
00:09:30,006 --> 00:09:31,705
Until now.

111
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:34,639
I guess he figured if he could
find and kill the chosen one,

112
00:09:34,739 --> 00:09:36,706
he would become
Kung Fury himself.

113
00:09:36,806 --> 00:09:38,852
He must have traveled in time
in order to get here,

114
00:09:39,374 --> 00:09:42,074
that's probably why
he disappeared.

115
00:09:42,174 --> 00:09:43,542
So, what're you gonna do?

116
00:09:44,075 --> 00:09:45,443
My job.

117
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,909
I'm gonna go back in time
to Nazi Germany,

118
00:09:48,009 --> 00:09:49,809
and kill Hitler,
once and for all.

119
00:09:49,909 --> 00:09:52,010
So, how are you gonna do that?

120
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,944
I'm not sure.

121
00:09:54,044 --> 00:09:55,845
I need some sort of
time machine.

122
00:09:59,845 --> 00:10:00,555
Wait a minute,

123
00:10:00,555 --> 00:10:02,522
using an RX modulator,
I might be able to conduct

124
00:10:03,513 --> 00:10:06,180
a mainframe cell direct and
hack the uplink to the download.

125
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,585
What does that mean?

126
00:10:07,585 --> 00:10:10,419
With the right algorithms,
I can hack you back in time.

127
00:10:11,814 --> 00:10:13,849
Just like a time machine.

128
00:10:13,949 --> 00:10:16,349
Well then, it's hacking time.

129
00:11:32,834 --> 00:11:33,901
Oh, no!

130
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:36,380
<i> Fuck!</i>

131
00:12:36,948 --> 00:12:38,581
<i> That's a Laser-Raptor.</i>

132
00:12:38,681 --> 00:12:40,915
<i> I thought they went
extinct thousands of years ago.</i>

133
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,621
Who are you?

134
00:13:06,721 --> 00:13:07,821
My name,

135
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:10,422
is Barbarianna.

136
00:13:16,956 --> 00:13:18,657
What year is this?

137
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:20,324
It's the Viking age.

138
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,957
<i> That explains the Laser-Raptor.
Fuck!</i>

139
00:13:23,057 --> 00:13:25,059
<i> I went too far back in time.</i>

140
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:27,125
You need to get out
of this valley.

141
00:13:27,225 --> 00:13:29,526
This place is swarming
with Laser-Raptors.

142
00:13:29,626 --> 00:13:32,960
I'll meet you at the God's drop.
Katana can help you get there.

143
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:34,727
Who's Katana?

144
00:13:34,827 --> 00:13:35,961
I'm Katana.

145
00:13:39,561 --> 00:13:41,896
I can give you a ride to Asgard.

146
00:13:41,996 --> 00:13:43,763
A ride on what?

147
00:14:05,834 --> 00:14:08,101
So, who are you?

148
00:14:08,201 --> 00:14:10,428
I'm a cop from the future.

149
00:14:10,428 --> 00:14:12,528
I was sent back in time
to kill Hitler,

150
00:14:13,302 --> 00:14:17,771
but I accidently went
too far back in time

151
00:14:17,871 --> 00:14:19,205
and ended up in this place.

152
00:14:21,738 --> 00:14:23,823
I know someone
who might be able to help you.

153
00:14:28,573 --> 00:14:32,807
Thor!

154
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:50,146
Behold! It is me, Thor!

155
00:14:50,444 --> 00:14:53,378
Son of Odin
and protector of mankind.

156
00:14:53,478 --> 00:14:55,412
Check out my pecs.

157
00:14:55,512 --> 00:14:56,913
Your pecs are epic.

158
00:14:57,012 --> 00:14:58,379
Thanks bro!

159
00:15:02,847 --> 00:15:04,882
So, anyway.

160
00:15:05,315 --> 00:15:08,781
Thor, this is Kung Fury,
he's a cop from the future.

161
00:15:08,881 --> 00:15:12,416
Yeah, I need to get to
Nazi Germany and kill Hitler...

162
00:15:12,515 --> 00:15:14,561
- so if you could help me with--
- Stop!

163
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:18,384
Hammer time.

164
00:15:22,218 --> 00:15:26,986
Walk through this portal and
you'll end up in Nazi Germany.

165
00:15:27,086 --> 00:15:29,620
Good luck to you Kung Fury!

166
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,787
Thanks Thor!

167
00:15:37,422 --> 00:15:40,256
Well,
looks like this is my ride.

168
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:43,890
Hey, future cop,
where are you going?

169
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:51,295
You know what.
Here, take my number.

170
00:15:52,258 --> 00:15:54,304
And use this phone to call me.

171
00:15:54,304 --> 00:15:57,305
It's a personal, transportable,
cellular telephone.

172
00:15:57,693 --> 00:16:00,717
It features 645 channel
capacity,

173
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:05,295
10 number speed dial,
and an electronic security lock.

174
00:16:05,395 --> 00:16:08,419
This revolution in communication
could make it possible

175
00:16:08,762 --> 00:16:11,863
for more and more people
to have a phone in their car!

176
00:17:30,243 --> 00:17:31,943
Tank you.

177
00:17:40,349 --> 00:17:45,250
I'm the greatest Kung Fu master
of all time,

178
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,651
right guys?

179
00:17:53,886 --> 00:17:56,320
Thank you!

180
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:11,185
I'm disarming you.

181
00:18:11,185 --> 00:18:13,253
My arm! My arm!

182
00:18:27,158 --> 00:18:28,358
Kill him!

183
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,348
You don't need that spine,

184
00:20:04,481 --> 00:20:05,882
it's holding your back!

185
00:20:35,889 --> 00:20:37,022
A-ha!

186
00:20:37,122 --> 00:20:38,522
Fuck you Kung Fury.

187
00:20:38,623 --> 00:20:41,718
Now nothing can stop me
and my army of death.

188
00:20:54,792 --> 00:20:56,028
Thank you guys!

189
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:04,629
What the fuck?

190
00:21:48,305 --> 00:21:49,605
Kill them!

191
00:22:44,785 --> 00:22:50,086
Alright Hitler, the gig is up,
show me your hands.

192
00:23:07,922 --> 00:23:10,991
Hackerman,
have you seen Kung Fury?

193
00:23:13,257 --> 00:23:15,758
Oh, no! We were too late.

194
00:23:53,267 --> 00:23:54,867
Who the hell are you?

195
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:57,925
My name is Cobra.

196
00:23:57,925 --> 00:24:01,560
I've been expecting you
Kung Fury.

197
00:24:01,903 --> 00:24:04,136
I'm your spirit animal.

198
00:24:04,236 --> 00:24:06,103
What the hell is this place?

199
00:24:06,203 --> 00:24:10,604
This is heaven,
I'm afraid you're dead.

200
00:24:11,304 --> 00:24:12,805
What?

201
00:24:12,905 --> 00:24:15,205
But it looks so real.

202
00:24:15,305 --> 00:24:19,439
Yeah, no it's totally real.

203
00:24:19,539 --> 00:24:21,672
Mr. Cobra, I'm a police officer.

204
00:24:21,773 --> 00:24:24,808
I need you to send me
back to earth, pronto.

205
00:24:25,241 --> 00:24:27,441
I'm sorry,
I can't help you with that.

206
00:24:27,541 --> 00:24:30,241
You see, you're dead.

207
00:24:30,342 --> 00:24:32,576
- You're under arrest!
- What?

208
00:24:32,676 --> 00:24:37,343
For obstruction of justice,
you're breaking the law!

209
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,613
What the hell happened?

210
00:24:52,713 --> 00:24:55,347
I hacked away all of
your bullet wounds Kung Fury.

211
00:24:55,447 --> 00:24:56,681
Thanks!

212
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:21,014
I want to welcome you
and your friends to Germany.

213
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:25,976
We are not so different,
you and I.

214
00:25:26,885 --> 00:25:30,285
I mean we both got
good style, you know?

215
00:25:30,889 --> 00:25:32,556
Red, you know?

216
00:25:33,256 --> 00:25:34,523
So, that's cool!

217
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:40,125
We both like doing moves,
check it out!

218
00:25:42,225 --> 00:25:46,460
And killing people, I love it,
you clearly do, too!

219
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:48,793
And that's cool!

220
00:25:49,993 --> 00:25:51,427
Join me,

221
00:25:51,527 --> 00:25:54,561
we could be brothers,
we are so alike.

222
00:25:54,994 --> 00:25:57,795
It's almost like
we finish each other's...

223
00:25:57,814 --> 00:25:59,348
- Balls.
- What?

224
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:23,869
Oh, my,
not much left of him is there?

225
00:26:24,301 --> 00:26:26,168
The important thing is that
he is gone.

226
00:26:27,568 --> 00:26:29,601
Sorry I doubted you Triceracop.

227
00:26:29,702 --> 00:26:31,636
You're the best damn partner
I've ever had.

228
00:26:31,736 --> 00:26:34,740
I came back in time
for you Kung Fury,

229
00:26:34,903 --> 00:26:37,203
because, damn it,
I love you.

230
00:26:41,238 --> 00:26:44,539
Team work is very important.

231
00:26:45,872 --> 00:26:48,906
So, what happens now Kung Fury?

232
00:26:51,764 --> 00:26:53,790
Well, I need to
head back to the office.

233
00:26:55,908 --> 00:26:58,542
Looks like it's gonna be
hell of a lot of paperwork.

234
00:27:21,147 --> 00:27:22,580
Open the doors, Hoff.

235
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,415
<i> I'm sorry Fury,
I can't let you do that.</i>

236
00:27:25,515 --> 00:27:26,794
Open the doors, Hoff!

237
00:27:26,794 --> 00:27:29,994
<i> I'm sorry, I can't let you
open the doors Kung Fury.</i>

238
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:32,249
Goddammit, open the doors!

239
00:27:32,349 --> 00:27:35,951
<i> - Sorry I can't--
- Open the doors!</i>

240
00:27:36,051 --> 00:27:41,552
<i> Did anyone ever tell you
not to hassle the Hoff 9000?</i>

241
00:27:41,652 --> 00:27:44,686
Oh, Hoff 9000,
you son of a bitch.

242
00:27:59,222 --> 00:28:01,255
Piece of shit.

243
00:28:17,093 --> 00:28:19,326
<i> Oh, my,
not much left of him is there?</i>

244
00:28:19,426 --> 00:28:22,461
<i>
The important thing is that
he is gone.</i>

245
00:28:34,531 --> 00:28:35,997
Game over.

246
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,065
<i> Wait a minute,</i>

247
00:28:40,665 --> 00:28:42,999
<i> I've seen that symbol before...</i>

248
00:28:45,166 --> 00:28:46,533
<i> somewhere.</i>

249
00:28:55,935 --> 00:28:57,135
Hitler!

250
00:28:58,305 --> 00:29:58,663
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
